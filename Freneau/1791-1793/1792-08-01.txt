HAVING in your p:ipÂ«r of Vfjy 3d
mentioned Dr, Logan'* rotation of
crops, it may be proper to observe that
altho' the general principles of that rota
tion are agreeable to the new and moll ap
pmved mode o! English husbandry ; yet
the particulars of it mull always be liable
to alteration according to the Puliation or
foil of the farm. The quantity of flax and
potatoes proposed to be railed will tin
doubt appear iinproper to many gentle
men in Virginia who hitherto have been
too commonly fupplicd with linen from
Europe, and who have confined their cul
tivation of potatoes to the garden merely
for the table. In ground weil manured
I have found both crops profitable and
highly ufeful. It may be regarded as a
difgracc to this agricultural country that
we do not cultivate a fuflicient quantity
of flax to supply the whole consumption
of linen within the United States. With
regard to potatoes, their introduction on
the farm is one of the greatell improve
ments of modern husbandry. For several
years I have made potatoes the principle
food for cattle, hoffei, fliecp, hogs and
poultry, for the two latter they should be
boiled ; for the former they should be
washed clean, cut small, and mixed with a
finall quantity of indian meal and cut draw
Oxen and sheep will fatten more in one
wc-ik on this food, than with turnips in
two.
The means of giving and perpetuating
a fertility to the foil, without the aid of
any mlnure eacept what can be created
on the farm, conflitutes one great objedl
in a rotation of crops. I have made a
variety of experiments 011 this fubj -ft, and
have considered it well. lam of opini
on,

pursued which will not exhaust th- foil,
without the periodical application of ma

ground or by the pafluring of cattle.
idly. To give one impovirilhed acre a
full drcfling will require a quantity of ma
nure nearly equilto the value of the land.
jdly. No rotation of crops can be pur
sued that will enable a farmer to procure
from the (lock and produce of the farm a
greater quantity of manure than will an
nually fully drefa more than one ninth part
of his farm.
/ftldy. That a nine years rotation of
cross connected with the bed barn yard
management will forever support a farm
within itf'elf in the liigheft degree of cul
tivation.
I have been pointed in my remaiks
refpefting manure becaufi the gentlemen
in Virginia are too inattentive to this im
portant article of good husbandry.
Some fpeculltive men have ventured an
opinion that manure was not necessary <111
a farm. Tull and his followers maintain
that the complete pulverizing of the earth
by the plough &harrow is ail that is requi
site for perfetting the growth and vigor of
plants. Tull was himfelf perfunded and en
<lcavoured to purfuadc others that this
alone would fuflice, without the aid of ma
nure! which be contended could only
fcra i" divide tkc foil tad rendei it friibli.
Experience, the furell guide in all human
affairs, affords us the moll convincing dc
monllrations to the contrary of this opini
on. But altho' we cannot adopt Tull'*
principles of cultivation to the extent of
his own ideas : yet it mull be allowed
that Mr. Ttlll's exertions to support a fa
vorite lyftem have been of infinite service
to agriculture, as they have tended to
convince farmers of the prodigious advan
tages to lie derived from deep ploughing,
4 j'ood harrowing, and putting the ground
in a good tilth before lowing.

plan of con Inking tlieir farms previous
to the in trod it tiott of clover. Agreeably
to the new fyllem of agiitulture it is evi

The Philadelphia agricultural lociety

for the heft experiment of a five years

which have been prac.ifed in England.
A five years rotation of crdps may be
purlued with advantage on a few acres in
the neighbourhood o> a large city, from
whence any quantity of manure could be
procured. In this iituation a eourfe of
crops could not take place that would be
more productive and valuable, than that
mentioned in l)r. .Logan's 13th experi

religious orders that found their interetl

be one of the good consequences of the

May 4, Tho' Ihe patriotic French so
far refpedt the memory of the late Empe

yet they are not the less sensible of the
dangerous policy of his conduit, The
whole tenor of that policy, while emperor,
was a plain proof that it was his intention
to modify the French conftitut'on ; and that
under this view, he projected a concert of
powers. To Iteer clear of opposition, he
had persuaded himfelf that only a faction
exillecl in France, equally hostile to the
king and the constitution, and whose ma
chinations prevented the return of the
emigrants â 1 he king of Hungary f;ems
infatuated with the fame delusive system,
and is bent upon fomenting divisions a
mongst the French and meddling with
their in'.ernal trouble?, without crfcover
ing a difpofrtion to attack the ruling in
clination of (he public. Like his father,
he attributes entirely to the Jacobins, the
enthuiiailic love of liberty, the attach
ment to equal rights, and the determina
tion that they fh. ll not be infringed. But
he ought to have known that the real pat
riots 01 1' ranee are those who disapprove
of the measures of the high flying Jacobins
and }tt confederate with them so far as
their aim is simply to uphold the confli
tution. All the French p-friots, under
this or whatever denomination, are persua
ded that the worll confequcnces are to be
feared from the ariltocrats, a faction that
would never have exilted if Leopold, in di
rect opposition to treaties with France,
had not encouraged and protested them,
and fuffered them to be formed into armed
bodies throughout the empire. In fliort,
the plan of Leopold was, and that of his
fuceefTor is, 110 other than to perpetuate
the troubles in France, to eredl the nati
on into two parties, to annihilate one by
means of the other, and thus at length de
stroy both and re-ellablifh despotism. h
is even not improbable that the views of
certain powers extend so far (as formerly

On the . pjioin'ment of Conferees and Cor

Members of Congress, &c.
By H. H. BiiAcKENniDOE.
IT is the happiness of a free govern

v, hi ch tile balk do not chnfe, on principle ot
delicacy, to oppose ; I fayatnofuch meet
ing, and all town or diltrict meetings will
be Inc.';, can an appointment take place
which will justly represent the people. Or
even if the whole of the citizens Ihotikl as
semble, a thing not to be expected, and
ballots fairly taken, so that those appointed
were really the choice of the town or dif
trift, i.s it certain that the choice of tlr fc
at tiie conference, would be the choice
which the people would otherwise have
made ; because the persons that go for
ward will have attachments and resent
ments, interelts and partialities, hopes and
fears, which those at home know nothing
of, but which will be fully exercised when
they come to form a ticket, and it will be
easy for them when they come back, to
frame an apology for the choice made if not
agreeable, by faying they were the only namn
that would go down with the conferees of other dif
t"Bs- The fact is, that envy or jealoufv of
equal or superior abilities will unavoidably
operate at any fucli conference to preclude
men of merit. Such a conference may be
justly styled a junto or cabal; and I never
iound truth, honour, juffice, or generosity
with fucli yet. It is the circumstance that
makes men ait and be what they are, and it is
a good request " lead us not into tempta
tion, but deliver us from evil." I judge
from my own feelings, and know thaewere
I at a conference at this moment there are
thole v\ hom I would oppose. just because 1
do not like them ; they have injured or in
sulted me and I hate them, though the peo
ple that sent me know nothing of it, and
have no fnfpicion but that I would make
the fame choice that they themselves would
make. If all men would speak the truth,they
would fay that the cafe with them would
be the fame. The people therefore at the
town or diftrici meeting, put themselves
in the power of the paffious of the conferees
and do injullice to thof. persons whom they
would otherwise have ciiofen.
A ticket, once pit up is wot easily taken down ;
and therejore the act ot the conferees will
unavoidably have an influence,tho' itdeferv
ed to have none; becaule though the citizens
might never have thought of proposing yet
tiiey may be unwilling to oppose the name;
brought forward ; and (he bare annuncia
tion is an advantage which the names in the
ticket have in their favor ; so that it may
be hopelel . to oppose, and to bring forward
others in the face of this advantage.
I he appointment of conferees,therefore,
becomes, onihefe principles, an invafioii ot
the right of the citizens at large to think,
judge and act for themselves in the firft in
ltance. It is a fraud by one neighbour on
another, the choice being brought forward
by a machinery of chu!ing,in which one may
acquiefceand another not. Leave it to every
ni.in to frame iiis ticket, or be immediately
inltrufted by others how todoit; but let it
be his own ast, and there is no deception,
or injustice.
But more especially the appointment of
conferees becomes amnvajion of the rights oj
tlwfe who are or may be candidates, being a fore
ltaHiiig of the publicchoice ; a preoccupy

PHILADELPHIA,
August 1792.
Information is received, by way of letter, from
Marietta, th.it the Indians have not been trouble
lome in or near that neighbourhood, during the
late spring, and part of the fuuimer season, ex
cept in one or two instances. It is fid that a
council of the savages was in feflion the latter
end ol June, at the Tawwa river, to the number
of 4000 members, for the purpule of regulating
then future proceedings. Two {lags had been
lent 111 to them by Gen. Wilkinfbn, to found
their dispositions.
Two vellels are arrived at Bollon from Cadiz,
which bring European accounts to the 11th of
June. " Preparations for war were making in
Spain, and a general war in Europe was expect
ed. I was alio laid the Spaniards would aÂ£t
against the French. A report was current at
Cadiz, that a battle had h;en fought between the
trench on the One fide, and Prufiian and German
troops 6n the other, in which 14 or 15,000 of
the ircnch were fiain." I'rom other informa
tion. to the 7th of June, fiom places much near
er the luppoled Icenc of a6lion than Cadiz,
there is the bell reason to believe that t'-e above
could have been only the exaggerated rumours
of the tepulfe at Tournay and Mons.
Letters and public papers from CharleHon, to
July 19, lay nothing of the uncommon dilcafcs
that have been reported to prevail in that city
but that 011 the contrary it continued health) as
ulunl at that time of the year.
The gtneial aflembly of the (late of Rhode-
I{land are called by a Ipecial wairant lioin the

On the 14th of July, in the City-Hall at
Charleston, a discourse was delivered by Mr.
I.uby to a large number of gentlemen who had
allembled to celebrate the anniverfaty of the
French revolution. It is remarkable, that the
whole of this difcourle, except three or four
and twenty of the iiift lines, is to be found in
Boulanger's Origine duDfpotifmc,printed at Am
flerdain, 1776.
The,following paragraph is from a New-
Hampshire paper, of July 15. "A large
number of the electors of the upper coun
ties of this state are determined upon their
choice of representatives in Congrels. Con
ceiving that the following gentlemen, from
their known abilities and integrity, are ca
pable of doing high honour to the Hate, we
folicitall dalles of our brother freemen, to
unite in giving them their fuffragesâviz.â
the Hon. James Sheafc, ALirf Fojler, John Shel
burne, and William Page, Efquires.âlt is fol
ly for us to be duped any longer by the ar
tifice of a number of people who reside in
the lower counties of this state. The idea
they have long held up of the county of
Cheshire, See. being destitute of a man pof
fefllng abilities adequate to those which
â iught to accompany a Congreflional Mem
ber into that honourable lioufe, is, in every
respect, FALSE. And, to convince the
world thereof, the last mentioned gentle
mrffi is intended for our choice âwhom, we
doubt not, when chosen, will demonstrate
not only the falfity of the idea, but alio the
BASENESS of its intended ejfe&s."
A Vermont paper, printed at Windsor
in that state relates, that " the wife of
Mr. Alhbel Webb, of the town of Bradford
was, on the 12th of July delivered of a
child the 1110 ft Angular ai:d extraordinary
of any, perhaps ever known 111 tlii; part of
the world. It had two <liltinÂ£t head:, four
arms, one body, and four legs. The child
was Hill-born, and the mother is in a fa.
vourable (ituation as to her health."
The Rev. S.union Occtim, a noted In
dian preacher at Stockbridge, near Oneida
in the llate of New-York, diedon or about
the 14th of July. In the woods while search
ing for timber, in company with a friend.
He had been previouflv ill, but was tempt,
ed to make this c.tciirfion upon a supposi
tion that he was getting better. He was
buried on the 15th. His funeral lermon
was preached by the Indian mitlionary,
K irkland, frem Matt. 24, verse 44. Up
wards ofthrep hundred Indians, from dif.
rerent tribes, attended his funeral.
The Rev. Mr. Thayer, of BoHon, has
declined any further controversy with the
eastern Sachem, J. f<ar(Hner,Kfi|. unless in
future he, Gardiner, fubferibes what he
writes with his real name. Mr. Thayer
alferts that Mr. Gardiner disbelieves all
miracles: "but (queries he) is there not
something miraculous in his being ltruck
with the palsy in his right-hand, at the very
time he was writing all his blasphemies a
gainst God and his faints? âIf he will be
lieve, perhaps he may be made whole."
Extra'l of a Utter from the city of IVa/fiingtCii,
dated.the 22d July 1792.
" The commiflioners attended on the Presi
dent the 16th inflant. About 26 plans tor the
Capitol and President's houte were presentedâ
viz.âfrom Malfachufetts, New-York, Peilnfyl
vania, Maryland, Virginia and South-Carolina.
Several of the artills were prelent. A prefer
ence was given to a plan of :..0 President's house
made out by Mr. James Hoben, of Charleston,
South-Carolina. Theie were others of consi
derable merit. The house will be about 170 by
90 or 100 feet. Thi outside walls piohably of

ble recommendations of hi* character and expe
rience, had a tegular education in the fludy of
architecture, and poirdfes honorable tcftimonials
of his success in some competitions of (kill in that
line. He is employed by the commdfioncrs to
superintend the execution of bis plan, and such
other matters as may be placed under him.
The work for the foundation of the Prefident'i
house was entered 0.1 the next day, and the ne
celiary materials arc collcfted and collecting at
the spot.
No choice was made out of the plans for a
Capitol. It is expetted this will take place in
next mouth."
" On Thursday last (July 26) fays a New-
Vork paper) Capt. M'Oougalt arrived at
this port, in 36 days from Havre-de-Grace.
We can learn but few particulars by this
vefTelâl courier, however, had arrived
from theÃrabantine country, five days be
ford (he failed, vi.'.. on the 20th June, who
informed, that no action had happened
lincethofeofMons and Valenciennes ; that
the armies were not far from each other ;
the anny in general were deploring the de
lulion which occalioned Dillon's fate, and
that discipline was an object much fought
after,and delired by the patriotic loldiery. "
11 is the artfulpolicy of certain designing
chara&ers (jSys a correspondent) to propa
gate an opinion, that the great body of the
people may at this time lie resolved into 0.
clatles, the federal (an immense majority)
and the anti-ftderel, a trifling number of fac
tious and difconteiued persons. The fe
deral'(according to them) are those "who
indiscriminately approve of every measure
of government, as imftiaculate and iuft, and
are fully fatisfied with the prcfent iituatior
of things. The anti-federal are those whe
disapprove of fjute of its measures, ant
thereby, and therefore, are plotting the over
throw of the government, and ought to be
discouraged from publifiiirig their sedition:
opinions." This is taking matters upon 1
wrong ground. The people are, in fact
only republican and anti-republican. The re
publicans are those who conlider the agn
-jdtural interest and the equal rights of mar
as the only true and solid natural basis of tlx
government of the U. States, and are tor ex
prelling themselves freely with regard to fuel
aits or proceedings of government as appeal
to them partial or unjust, and endeavoring
areform. The anti-republicans (few it i:
to be hoped in number) are those win
would support the government upon ar
irtificial balls, upon the influence of exor
bitant wealth, upon speculation, upon ma
nufactures, and upon any interest, excep
the agricultural. It is amazing, with eve
ry discouragement from the conftitntion
how rapidly the monied influence has beet;
gaining ground for several years paltâtc
uch a tiegree, and such have been its ma
loeuvres, that were it not for the abolifh
inent of entails, and two or three other
tlifqualifying circumstances, there is little
doubt, that within ten years it would efta
jlidi itfelf into a powerful hereditary aris
tocracy, if not something worse- If Ame
rican liberty is durable, it muff be the vir
tues and vigilance of the yeomanry, in op
jolltion to pampered Croesus's, that will
ireferve the sacred flame.
On Sunday last (fays the Salem paper ol
July 24) Capt. Jonathan Lambert arrived
liere from the Cape of Good Hope. The
British frigate jfcolus, which failed from
Calcutta about the 20th of February with
lifpatehes from England, touched at the
Cape about the 20th of April. The ac
rounts by this frigate were, that Lord
Cornwallis's army liad taken several of the
jut pods of Seringapatam, Tippoo Saib'j
rapital; that the arnly svas in high spirits,
ind that there was not the least doubt that
Jeririgapatam would soon fall ; but that it
lad not been taken when the frigate failed.
Tippoo, under this apprehenlion, had with
irawn himfelf, with many of hit principal

At a large meeting of the citizens of the
icy of Philadelphia, held at the ltate-houfe,
in Monday the 30th day of July, 1792,
purfuantto notice given in the nevvfpapers,

(ihief Justice, in the Chair ;
After reading over and amending the
minutes of a former meeting, they resolv

In our last and present number is adver
tised for sale Mr. Barlow's " Advice to the
Privileged Order ,in the several States ol
Europe," &c. The following character of
this book, from the New-York Daily Ad
vertiser, precludes the necessity of our fay
ing any thing on the merits of a work,
which requires only to be read to be uni
verfall v clleemed.
" Barlow's publication, entitled, " Ad
vice to the privileged orders in the several Jlates oj
Europe," will make a conspicuous figure
among the molt celebrated performances 0
flic present, or perhaps any other age. It
exhibits' that generous glow of feniibility
towards the human race, which must warm
and invigorate tlis feelings of every reader.
wW has any pretentions to a fufceptiMc
heart With relpeit to the beauties ot'
this work, they Itrike the eye forcibly at
every turn. Its defects, fliould there be
any, will almost elude discovery ; because,
like the spots on the fun, they are over
whelmed by the effulgence with which they
are surrounded.
Viewed as a philosophic treatise, this
work embraces thole ideas which the molt
pe.rfeib reason must approve. It elevates
the mind above those prejudices which are.
the effect of a falfe education ; and illus
trates an important truth, that the viceÂ»
and miseries, which overspread the earth,
are not to be ascribed to the inherent pro
pensities of human nature, lo much as to
faults and ticfectS in those artificial institu
tions, which have existed under an unna
tural and perverse ltate of society. Re
store man to the proper destiny of his na
ture, and it will annihilate the fuurces from
which have flowed those crimes and mis
fortunes, which hitherto have been deem
ed inseparable froni human beings. Na
ture has bee,n perverted in inoft of the so
cieties that were ever formed. When
ever we behold an individual or a nation,
committing evil, and prefled by adversity,
\vc iliould look for the cause among the
faults of education or government. These
points are fully illustrated in the pamphlet
under contemplation.
In examining this work as a piece of fine
composition, we find an energy and ele
gance that cannot be surpassed, nor too
much admired. The ityle, it lrmft be con
fefled, is bold and figurative ; but-jheim i
gery is so natural and well chosen, that we
are charmed, in every inltance, where the
exprellion rises above simplicity. In short,
we here find the ardour of eloquence unit
ed with the precilion of philosophy. This
forms a blend that makes the performance
at once fafcinating and inftruftive.
For the National Gazette.
Mr. Fkeneau,
IT is insinuated in the " National Ga
zette" ot last Saturday, that " by under
mining another who was in possession of
t!ie employ," the fubferiber obtained the
work which he has executed for the Go
vernment. âThis can refer only to prfnt
ing the Journals of the Senate of the United
States. With some persons it may be
fufricient for me to fay, the charge is
wholly unfounded. Those who wills for
further fatisfaition, by calling on me, may
be convinced that the insinuation is foine
thing more than a simple untruth.
With refpeft to the principles and senti
ments propagated by the Gazette of the
United States, the Editor of thai paper is
willing to abide by the general opin on of
the publicâThat public, whose essential
rcpuUicun\nteve{\ he hasfeduloufly attempt
ed to promote for twenty years paltâ arcl
to which he is now under additional and
more forcible obligations of attachment;
having as much at ltake, as an individual,
as the average of his fellow citizens, the
freedom and happiness of a numerous fa
mily of children.
