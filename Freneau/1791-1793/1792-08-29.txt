be attempted by the fuccefaful aflertors
of American liberty, a frontier now al
most deserted would f.:on be secured fiom
Indian invafiou and covered w)th cultiva
tors of the foil, who.without dread of mo
lestation would be enabled to form perma
nent eftablifhmeuts of iminenfe conse
quence, whose thick population in cafe of
need would afford an effectual oppolition,
agaicft fueh Indiana, or otheis, as fliould
have the temerity to be the aggressors.
But there i 3 one cbjcdt which I consi
der as tffential to Indian civilization, that
marriages should be encouraged and even
cufoKedj upon certain conditions; between
the Indian women and every white man
that should fettle within their territory.
This Hep would have a moil beneficial ef
fefl. Nature does not forbid the tie, and
when once faiictioned by cuftofn, marria
gesof this fort would become so frequent,
that in a few generations the distinction
of family would be wholy loft.
As to drunkenness, a direÂ£t prohibitory
law would not answer the purpose. for
cibly to prevent the use of itrong liquors,
is impracticable ; but this vice might in
some ineaiure be dclltoyed by declaring
the person additted thereto incapable of
holding any place, enjoying the right cf
luting in council, or even perpetual ex
clulion, according to the heinoufnefs of
the ciime committed in confeqtience of in
ebriety, or according to the frequency of
the fault. It might alio be forbidden
them to introduce any species of liquor in
to their councils, independently of annul
ling all t'neir decisions at that leflion,
and the suspension of the head chief for
one term if he did not difTolve the council
immediately upon his oblcrviiig the intro
duction of liquor, and rendering him inca
pable of advancement to any poll who
should be guilty of this fault, the worst of
sll others by reason of its consequences,
which, among savages arc generally fatal.
For the Nation al Gazette.
WHETHER the diabolical nature
be the prevalent one among man
kind is not to my present purpose to en
quire. For the honour of our species it
is hoped the New-Hampshire author's
opinion in its utmolt latitude, is not well
founded That there are partial diaboli
cal propensities amongst us there can be no
doubt, as well as a constant repetition of
aitions completely and unequivocally dia
bolical ; â'a recent instance of which I
lhall briefly bring into view.
Some time lad week a man was driving
a flock of sheep thro' one of the streets of
this city, to the slaughter. One of the
sheep, not much in size above the deno
mination of a Lamb, and driving not quite
so well as the reft, lagged a little behind,
probablv through lamenels or weariness,
which so incensed the driver that in the
public ffreet he seized the devoted animal
with the grasp of an infernal savage, and
applying his thumbs behind the eye balls,
thrulk them both out in the view of num
bers of fpedtators.
With what face can we pray " lighten
thou our darkness, O Lord we befcech
thee," when excesses like this are fuffered
to be committed almost daily, with impu
nity 1 âThe beating poor dray horses on
the head with the butt end of a whip han
idle is also shocking to the humane, but is
every day witnessed to be inflidted in the
molt cruel and wanton manner, to the
disgrace of our police, part of whose duty
it certainly is to fee that the brute creati
on, under our power, and confined in out
(hackles, are treated with that degree of
lenity, which reason and conscience, with'
out the aid of law, will enjoin upjn every
thinking man.

WHEREAS divers wicked and (editions
writings have been printed, published, and
industriously dispersed, tending to excite tu
mult and disorder, by endeavouring to raift
groundless jealoulies and discontents in the
minds of our faithful and loving ftibjefts,
refpefting the laws and happy constitution
of government, civil and religious, estab
lished in this kingdom; and endeavouring
to vilify and bring into contempt the wife
and wholesome provilions made at the time
of the glorious revolution, and since
strengthened and confirmed by subsequent
laws for the preservation and security of the
rights and liberties of our faithful and lo
ving fubjefls: And wherea* divÂ«rs writings
ha*e a!fo been printed, publifhtd and in
ditftrioufly dispersed, recommending tlie
laid wicked and Seditious publications tÂ«
the attention of all our faithful and-laving
fubjefU : And whereas we have also reason
to believe that correspondencies have been
entered into with sundry persons in foreign
parts, with a view to forward the criminal
and wicked purposes above mentioned. â
and whereas the wealth, liappinefsand pros
perity of this kingdom do, under Divine
Providence, chietty depend upon a due Sub.
million to the laws, a just confidence in the
integrity and wisdom of parliament, and a
continuance of that zealous attachment to
the government and constitution of the
kingdom, which has ever prevailed in the
minds of the people thereof : And whereas
there is nothing which we so earnestly de
lire as to secure the public peace and pros
perity, and to preserve to all our loving fub
jecls the full enjoyment of their rights aud
liberties, both religious and civil : We,
therefore, being resolved, as far as in us
lies, to repress the wicked and seditious
practices aforefaid, and to deter all persons
from following so pernicious an example,
have thought fit, by the advice of our privy
council, to iflue this our royal proclama
tion, Solemnly warning all our loving sub
jects, as they tender their own happinel' ,
and that of their posterity, to guard against
all such attempts which aim at the fubver
lion of all regular government within this
kingdom, and which are inconsistent with
the peace and order of society ; and ear
nestly exhorting them at all times, and to
the utmolt of their power, to avoid and
discourage all proceedings, tending to pro
duce riots and tumults ; and we do ftriÂ£lly
charge and command all our magistrates in
aud throughout our kingdom of Great-
Britain, that they do make diligent enquiry
111 order to discover the authors and print
ers of such wicked and seditious writing;
its aforefaid, and all others who lhall d;S
perSe the fame : And We do further charge
lad command all our Iheriffs, justices of the
r-eace, chief magistrates in our cities, bo

officers and magistrates throughout out
kingdom of Great-Britain, that they do, ir
their several and refpeftive stations, take
the molt immediate and effectual care tr
suppress and prevent all riots, tumults and
other disorders, which may be attempted
to be raised or made by any perfiin or per
sons, which, on whatever pretext they maj

law, but dangerous to the most importan:

The following is his Majesty's Addhess tc
both houses of Parliament.
My Lords and Gentlemen,
I cannot close the present Sellion of par
iament without returning you my particu
lar thanks for the attention and diligence
vvith which you have applied yourselves ti
the dispatch of the public business, and es
pecially to the important objects which 1
recommended to your consideration.
Gentlemen of the Hcufeof Commons,
The readinels with which you have grant
ed the ueceflary fupplics, and the frefi:
>roof which you have given of your con-
Icant alfeflion for my person and family, in
enabling me to provide for the eftablifli
iiient of my foil, the Duke of York, call foi
my warmest acknowledgments. 1 have
ilfo observed, with the utmost fatisfaflion,
the liieafures which you have adopted foi
the diminution of the public burthens ,
while you have, at the fame time, made ad
ditional provision for the reduction of the
orefent national debt, and eftabliihed aper
uhuent system for preventing the dange
rous accumulation of debt in future.
My Lords and Gentlemen,
I have seen with great concern the com
mencement of hostilities in different parts
of Europe. In the present situation of af
fairs, it will be my principal care to main
tain that harmony and good underltandinc
which subsist between me and the several
belligerent powers, and to preserve to ni>
people the uninterrupted bleilings of peace
âAnd the assurances which 1 receive from
all quarters, of a friei.dly difpolition to
wards this country, afford me the plealinc
hope of succeeding in these endeavours.
The recent expreflions of your uniforn:
and zealous attachment to the eftablithec
government and constitution. leave me 111
room to doubt that you will, in your seve
ral comities, be active and vigilant to main
tain those fentimeuts in the minds of ni\
faithful people ; and I have the happinefi
of receiving continued and additional proof:
of their jult lenfe of the numerous and in
creasing advantages which they now enju)
under the protection aud diiliuguilhed tC
vor of providence.
Then the lord chancellor, by his majes
ty's command, faiei,
My Lords and Gentlemen,
It is his Majeftv's rovat will and pleasure,
that thisparliament be prorogued to Thurs
day the 30th of August next, to be then
here holcfen ; and this parliament is accor
dingly prorogued to Thursday, the 30th day
of August next.
The Royal Proclamation atiaivfl Sedi
tion, See.
The firft ob;eÂ£t of this very neceflary and
wife meafnre being now completely attain
ed, the reft will follow of course. Its firft
objeÂ£t was, the approbation ojparliament-. and
this it had received ill the amplell and mod
unequivocal manner. For a proof of this,
we have but to refer to the names of those
noble, and honorable persons who vindica
ted the address of thanks for the proclama
tion in the two houses. Among these we
find the names not of the friends-of govern
ment solely, but also of the leading men in
opposition ; and from attending to those
names it seems perfectly fair to conclude,
that while the whole of the supporters 0/' gover
nment approve of the proclamation, at leojl mne tenths
of its ufual oppofcrs do the fame! Here we beg
leave to remark, that we are far from pre
fimling to fcandatize his royal highness the
Prince of Wales, by insinuating, that he de
serves to be considered as included with the
oppofers of his father's government. On
(he contrary we allcdge, being perfnaded
of the fact, that his royal highnefs's appro
bation of the conduct of government, and
his implied disapprobation of the conduct
both of the reforming focitlies, and of those
members of both houses, who opposed it ;
ought to be deemed nothing else than the
result of his own unbiafled, impartial con
dition.
The opposition is made up of three dif
tinft descriptions of menâof tories ; of mo
derate or old whigs, or, as fame call them,
innovators and Jacobins. The opinion of
the tories was in favour of the proclama
tion, and is to be collected from what war
said by Lord North, Lord Storinonr, &c.â
The opinion of the moderate whigs was ;<l
- in favou:' of the proclamation, and may
be collected from what was said by the
Marquis of Titchfield, the Duke of Port
land, &.C.â but as to the new whigs, or the
levellers, their opinion was, as it was ex
pected to beâaltogether hostile to the pro
clamation. Except Lord Lauderdale, (the
circuniftance is enough to confound the
fa it ion) not a liagle peer, ufuaily attached
to the opposition, (poke againlt the procla
mation ! ! !
Had the object of government been to
bring forward a queition calculated to prove
how heterogeneous, and discordant a mass the coa
lition is, none could have been so well cho
sen as that upon which both houses of par
liament have decided. But this was not
the object of government âalthough it is
one that has been gained while means have
been pursuing for gaining the real objefl.ââ 
The nation is obvioudy indebted to the ma
lignity of the fociely of the friends of the people, for
the i uleiible disgrace thrown by parlia
ment upon that, in common with all.other
innovating societies ? âwe fay malignity âfor
[hose gentlemen had nothing so immediate
ly in view as to bring 011 the difcullion "111
parliament of a queition, upon which they
well knew, that at this erfis, Mr. Pitt, as a
real friend to the king and constitution,
mull differ from them.
On Saturday morning a fellow was caught
in the fact of polling up great bills with the
dreadful words Murd eh, Fire, Trea
son, in large characters. Some vigilant
magiltrate, alarmed at this wicked attempt,
took the man into cuUody, and the bill was
produced in evidence of his guilt. What
was the astonishment of the worthy magif
:rate, when he found that the alarm had
aeen thus given by some loyal and peacea
ble citizen, in consequence of a meeting
iield at the Thatched-Houle Tavern by the
right hon. William Pitt, his grace the duke
of Richmond, and others, to bring about a
reform in the representation !âa thing
which, tending so formidably to sedition,
the zealous ljiagiftrate could not fee with
indifference. Whatftepshe has taken we
have not yet heardâwhether, according to
the order of proclamation, he has secretly
(;iven information to the right honorable
Henry Dundas, of the seditious meeting
held by the firft lord of the treasury, and
the inallcr general of the ordnance, two
men who are at the head of all the money
and al! the artillery of the kingdomâor
whether, in a more dignified exercise of his
functions, he has illued his warrants as a
constitutional jultice, for apprehending the
said Mr. Pitt and duke of Richmond, this
day will perhaps develope.
Mr. Pitt at three fucceflive periods moved
for a reform in the representation of the
people in parliament, and on each of ihefe
occasions he asserted the defects of the aitu
al representation to be as great, painted
them in as odious colours-, and drew oonfe
quences from them, as likely to inflame the
minds of the lowest ranks of the people, ai
the molt intemperate advocate for reform,
that has spoken or written 011 the fubjeit.
Of Mr. Pitt's confilteucy in abandoning
the principles which he then maintained ;
as well as of his candour in endavorirg to fix
the fligma of republicanism and sedition on
mtnwhonpw maintain similar principles,
but with more temperance and uifcrction,
we leave the public to judge.
From the speeches of the minister and thÂ«
panegyrics of his friends, it is now clear to
every unprejudiced per{on, that the best fornt
of government in the world is that where
the mod absolute and unlimited confidence
is reposed, not in the sovereign himfelf, but
in his ministers; and that Great-Britain
will always prosper in proportion as the
prime minister shall dictate to his master.
The invafiop of Poland by the Emprcfs of
Russia, proclaims to the world the conspi
racy which is now forming in the cabinets
of despots, against the felicity of nations.
Poland and France are conlidered as in the
fame predicament by the despots of the
earth, a,id every revolution which extends the
influence of the people by limiting the
domination of princes and nobility, is de
precated by thefuperior orders.Mr. Burke,
indeed, discriminates between the revolu
tion in France and that in Poland ; and
while he execrates the one revolution, he
allows the other a certain proportion of ap
plause. But in this concession, his doctrine
is as ofifenfive to tyrants as his genera ldoc
trine is offenfive to the learned, and an in*
fult to a civilized age.
In this country it feeffisto be the nobili
ty and the superior orders of citizens, who
feel any degree of alarm. The venerable
fabric of the British conftitiftion is likely to
be maintained with accumulated glory from
age to age. But whatever promotes gene
ral civilization, and confers importance on
the mass of citizens, creates a jealousy in
the ranks of life, and threatens the dimi
nution of that importance which isconnec
ted with hereditaty diftiu&'ons, with supe
rior affluence, with piiefthood, with nobi
lity, or with royal blood.âThe late procla
mation, on which princes and nobles bestow
ed almost unanimous applause, seem
not calculated, in any eminent degree
to abate the ferment in the public mind.
The public fnrely cannot be flatter
ed by a proclamation, which announce*
danger that can only originate in free
difculfion, and in the infatuation of the
people. The freedom of the press is the
palladium of the Britiili confhtution. Truth
will always ultimately triumph : and from
speculative opinions little danger can be
uppthended to church orftate.
If it were the determined refblution of
the cabinet to create disturbances, they
could not have taken a more elfeftnal course
than that which they have pursued, we
trust, for other ends.
To institute an unheard of fpeciei of in
qttifitionâto call upon all die magistrates
of the kingdom to become secret inform
ersâto eflablifh a black book, in which are
to be registered the names of all men who
dare to think, to write, and to talk, or rather
all men JuJ'pcÃed of thinking, writing, or
talking about their political coadition-r-tnr
provoke the mean and officious expectants
in every villageâthe frequenters of every
ale-houseâthe trading justices and bailiffs
of every borougli to curry favor with mi
nisters, by communicating the names of
every neighbour to whom they may chufe
to impute sedition ; âengendering the dark
passions of jealousy, malice and calumny, as
well as the more open emotions of popular
indignation, and patriotic alarmâare fnre
ly not the legitimate meaps of fecurjng the
public peace and prosperity of these realms.
It is certainly true that a proclamation
cannot make law. It is of no other life
than as a paternal admonition to put the
unwary upon their guard against the breach
of laws, which, from accident or neglect,
may havc.been fuffered to sleep. When it
does more than this, it is prefnmptuous and
illegal. It is almost always a reproach to
the minister that issues it, for it is a con
feffion of neglect ; but if it should so far de
viate from its true funQions, as to order and
command what was not previously directed,
and enjoined by law,it is a feriou's calamity*
for tiie minister (ports with the King's
name, and exposes the royal authority to
thedifdain of his people.
It has been impudently said, that the
v higs of England give their countenance (o
the proclamation. It might as well he said,
that they gave their countenance to any of
the publications that have provoked so
much difcuflionâto Mr. PAine's on the
one lide, or to Mr. Burke's on the other.
Such are not the principles upon which the
whigs would conduct the affairs of this
kingdom. They disclaim the proclamation
as impolitic and imbecileâas a measure
calculated to excite, and not to allay com
motionâas tending to irritate, and not to
harmonize the factions which divide the
country âand as a measure likely to fot
ward the evils that it profeflesto repel.
It is julf such a measure as the country
had reason to expect from a minister who
has, for more than eight yearss Jhvjjld be
tween prerogative and privilegeâwho has
one day stood up as thefriend ojiheptop!e, and
the next a> the mmjlcr of the crown~~ who has
been Jor and reformâ-far and ng.ainjl
toleration. Who one day involves lis in an
unnecessary war, and the next, hy the way
of atonement, makes a milerable (acrifice
to the people of necessary revenue. âFrom
a minuter thus (hitting to every point of
the political corneals, we may naturally ex*
pect fiich measures as these. To be remits
at one time, and to he rigorous at another ;
to fntfer the tardiness of magistrates one
day, and to call upon them to be meddlers
the- next âto cherish difcuflion, and to efta
bhih camps to fiiilc it âio permit pamphets to be freely difleminated for years, and
then to bring forth the anathema of a pro
clamation against them, is the natural re
sort of that irresolute, twiifting, tortuou 1 -
system which, fixed on 110 basis, & moving by
no regular ftream,catches on its aery height,
and is actuated by every wind that blows.
It was lately proposed in the American
Congress, to bestow three thousand pound
on Thomas Paine,as a reward for his literary
activity in supporting the revolution ill that
country. General Wathington, however,
abjeHed to the motion, but observing that he
did not wifli to fee a xnan of talents in ne
cefiity, recommended the sum of five hundred
pounds as an adequate teilimony of Ameri
can gratitude. It is worthy of rtmark, that
Thomas Paine has been anxiotÃ to make the
world believe that the utmost friend (hip fub

IV. The two contracting powefs have

It is not the distinctions of titles which confti
utes an ariftocracv : it is the principle of partial

DEAR Pitt ! is it not hard indeed,
Such wicked gibes should pass,
the pme and pitriot trend
Of thy belov'd Dun d as ?
But let them praise, or let them biamei
J care not a bawbee ;
My text lhall ever be the fameâ
44 Sirs ! wha wants me ?"
Wha wants me, tny friends !
Wha wants me ?
My text ilia 11 ever be the fameâ
â¢ 4 Sirs ! wha wants me ?"
Let Courtney in ironic (train,
Exhaust his Doric wit ;
The cause of this, to me, is plain-
He never dines with Pitt !
So let him praise See.
Let Cray, in a more manly style,
My trimmings ail unfold j
I'll patiently tupprels my oile t
And touch the nation's gold !
For let them praise See.
'Tis now some years and moreâ
I think'tis twenty-one,
Since i became a Senator,
And Minister's fir ft man.
For let them praise, Sec.
Whtn sleepy North the veflel fteer'd*
And fteerM wi'me.kU pain,
I with my pilot boat appeared
To tug him thro* the main.
For let them praise, See.
When wil\ Shelburne next came iff,
And made tnat gloriouspea.e j
1 lae'd about, and thought no fin
With him to coalelce.
Far let them piailc &c.
When Fox and TVbigs march'd into plaÂ«e f
(If they bad but inclin'd),
I Ihould have dee.m'd it no disgrace
Their party to-have join'd.
For let them praile See.
But thanks to G eor r, z, their reign was fliort J
The Loid prevail'o,
And cant ana cunnii g won a court,
Wheie worth and virtue fail'd,
So let tlum praile See.
N">w, since my SiLtY lutes the roast/

As long asâ fhal rule.
Fur let th-.m praile, See.
But should ev'n Bill himfelf go out,
And belx.ebub comc in j

And make a drv'lilh din !
