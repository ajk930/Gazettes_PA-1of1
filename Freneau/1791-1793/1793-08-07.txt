Ititerejling Gbfervations on Suing
the States.
r pHE question which now agitates the
]> 11 biit mind, is big with the wel
fare, peace and harmony of the Federal
Government in general, and of each State
and individual in particular". Itisaquef
tion which involves in it, the mofl inter
filing and alarming consequences, as it re
lates tu the Jnverc'gnty of tne Common
wealth, and the liberties and property of
every citizen :âFor fliould it be admitted
that the States mny be J tied in the Federal
Judiciary, the numerous prosecutions that
wil immi d ately iflue from the various
claims of refugees, todies, &c. will intro
duce fi.ch a series of litigatidn, as will
throw every Hate in the union into the
greate;! cunt'u.ion. Our refeiument wbuid
be naturally excited, to fee cur Governor,
ami attorney general ctjnftantiy arraigned
bclo e the federal tribunal ; and we cotllci
not but feel an indignity while reading the
mandate, which COMMANDS and enjoins
them to attend on this bufi.iefs. Can auj
thina be ni >re wounding to the freemen of
Maifccliufetts, than the ltile of the ftun
m > ;s.' âIt is couched in terms too humili
an to be here repeated. It might at
lea t !> ive carried in it a common decency
of The executive is " COM
MANDED" let the emergencies of tlife
Co n nj 1 wealth, be what they may, and
"laying 4iide ail other matters," to attend
at hij peril, on the claim of a William Vaf
fa.l. This "ORDER" is so percniptbry,
tliac nothing is to hinder him j and not
wi.hitanding the lilmitjoila is so urgent, it
rein lined from February to June, before
it was served. His excellency has now
nothing more Xo do, than hastily to attend
tithe Iriftifijj calls of'the commonwealth,
within the li iits of about fix weeks, and
then attend his important dutyat the fede
ral court, to anuver to the claims of sn
absentee.
Le'iflators of Maflachiifetts ! conltder
whether by adopting the conilitution, we
intended to place the commonwealth of
M tll'achufeits, in such a contemptible (ltu
ation I âWe conjure ym, if the fovereigii
ty and dignity of the state mult fall, let
them expire with some degre â  of deceacy,
and do not let the fiimmons of their dillo
lution, be couched in terms so pungent
ly humiliating.
The late atfion commenced agalnfl this
commonwealth, is founded upon the idea,
that the federal constitution, admits a:i in
dividual to sue a Hate. But in order to
ju.lgeon thisqueftion,as itrefpecis tile com
mon wealth, it is proper to take into conli
deration the debates in the state conventi
on, 0,1 this particular subject. Tne fenti
inents then delivered ought to liavetheir full
weight, even at this period ; as the princi
ples then advanced were undoubtedly the
opinions and intentions of " THE PEO
PLE." Admitting then that the judges
liave peremptorily decided, on the "liabi
lity'' of a date, tiiis date, if we are to con
clude from the deter nidations of the con
vention never acl ipted the constitution upon
any such acknowledgment; but 01 tne
contrary, all tie members expressly de
clared themselves oppoed to the principle.
If the decilion of the judges lias a tendency
to g ; ve an operation to the conltitutioit.
contrary to what the convention conceived,
the conifitntioii as miw explained, is 1101
the conilitution adopted by "THE PEO
PLE" of this commonwealth. It is pre
funied, that 110 advantage is to be taken 01
a subsequent conftruclion but that the de
clared intention of the convention ought
to have ftu h a decree of solemnity and force,
as to free'this slate from contending priii
tiples, which were in the firft inftancc
acknowledged both by the supporters aur
oppofers of the conilitution, a3 never beinj?
within its conltruftion. Every person thai
attended the debates, knows that this quel"
tion was agitated in the convention, aÂ»<
that it was treated as a vilionary, antifedc
ral idea ; and that both parties nnittiall;
and cordially consented, that the "fuabili
iy" of the state was not contemplated b\
the framers of the constitution; that it
jiever could be exerc'sfed, and in fail coulc
never bear that conitruftion.
1 Ins being the determination of th,
whole convention, it was palled over with
out any oppolition. It was so umverfi h.
reprobated, that if any man had at tli
time conic forward with any degree of fe
rioufnefs, to vindicste contrary principles,
lie would li.ive become ail ohjefi. or univer
fa! ridicule.
A further proof that no such idea was
tnteitained by the convention is, that no
amendment was prdpofed on this article :
If there had been any doubt oji ihe fiibjett,
this would have been among the foremofl
ariiclet in the amendments; the total
lilence therefore, li.ows clearly that it
never entered into the ltiind of any man,
hat it liibuld ever take place.
These being the real fa.'h, can it be said
that the conftriitlion of the confeitution, as
giitnb) tHe juilges, iÂ« a jult explanation,
â it relpeds ti <3 con,lll unvealtli ? Can ii
be argued that w c ought t.tc.tly to acquit Ice
in a decilion, so cbntrary to Uliatva una-
Nlr.loU.sUT acceded to in th& convention.
11l the common concerns of life, provide.:
the parties eipiefUy oliji ct to the lonilruc
tioji of a paragraph in any agreement pre
vious to signing of it, j'uftice would not
oblige them to comply with a decilion, dia
metrically contrary to the principles upoi'
.vhich the articles were originally fabri
eaten.
But it may be ohjecled that we are 1101
to fay what we meant at the time wt
adopted the conflituticn, but we mult sub
mit to the conilruction now put upon it b)
tile judge.. This kind of reasoning may do,
among a frt of lliarpers, negociator;, 01
hank-scrip speculators, who are ever plot
ting to impose Oil each other; but whet
ue are to ifulering a fubjeft on which the
liberty, harmony, and prosperity of a com.
muility depends, it is expected that othei
lentittients will operate ill the decilion. Ii
cannot be fuppoltd that the conftitutioi
wu.: offered, to entrap "The people," 01
surprise them into a measure wiiich the)
never contemplyred ; or th.it the fupport
rrs ot the conflitutioii, conceded to the. 1 op
pofers ol it, merely to take an advantage 0;
their credulity. When the objeflion wa;
made, tilt fir ft Characters (even learned ii
the law) pledged themfeives, that the ides
<vas erroneous, and that o profecutioii o!
a llate eVer could commence 011 the prill
ciple bf its own SOVEREIGN i"Y. Aftei
these folenin aflieveratiorts, is it a fair mode
of re foiling, to fay that we have adop.ee
it with all its impcrfeftions, and it u taw
too late to remedy our complaint ?
Nn freeman w ill be fati. si! d with fuel
paltry arguments. Maflachufetts Itantl:
too respectable in the federal lyitem, to bt
tllrouil from its elevated tilu tio.i by fu 1
ti iftnlg r atoning. She will not bedeprivet

ECUIIVE, to be perpetually harr.dfct
with innumerable prosecutions in the fede
ral court, by admitting a conflruclion, 11
direct opposition to what â¢ 'THE PEOPLE'
by their reprefentatlves, openly, and ex
prefsly declared againlt ? Every freemai
nlult replyâwe will not lore our liber
ties in so ignominious a manner.
Thi tieclaration made by each meiiibei
bf the general court is, "That the com
monwealtli of Maffachufctts is, and oi
right ought to be, a fret, Joverefgn, ant
iudfptuitnt Oate." We then retain 0111
lovereignty completely excepting so lv.net
as is given up to Congress. To ufcertaii
the degree of sovereignty \ve retain, we
mult examine what particular powers art
exclulively given to Congress ; and so fai
s the states are eXpressly left rifled, so far
aid no farther have we relinquilhed oui
fovereignry. Suppose then (for arguijien
fake) it is admitted, th t an individual cai
fne a slate, it cannot be in any other cast
than where the United States have an ex
cl 11 live riplit of judging.
For example, each state i . forbid by tin

T his construction is much more reason
able, tlian to fiibject a (late to be fueil in
discriminately in all cases ; ami to oblige
Jie executive to obey the fmnmonsofa
marlhilto the exclusion of all the duties of
his office ; and to render the commander in
chief of every slate a mere itinerant, to
dance attendance in Federal courts, to an
swer every trifling action that iÃay be
brought by litigious profecutort.
it the ltate is subject to fiich prafecutions
in jll cases, it is the highest absurdity to
talk of our fovereigtity : for if this is ad
mitted, there is not a (ingle trait remaining.
If ue surrender ourselves Into the Federal
court, "in all cases whatever," it is but
little (hort of the British claim, 11 to tax Us
in all cases whatever," and will, in time,
operate as d.-ftructive to the RIGHTS ami
PROPERTY of the people. If this is ad
mitted in the latitude now pleaded for, it
is an impolition on our senses, 10 talk ofour
I >vereignty ; tor a nation ftirrenders its fc
vt reignty, ds far as it relinquiflies the right
of final judgmentâand if in all cases, we
have done it, v\e have made by the adop
tion of the conllitutionj 9 complete sur
render of it to the federal judiciary ; as the
power of fin.il decilion is the eflence of so
\i re.gnty. Wherever thisdecifion is pla
ced, there the sovereignty mult be found.
But admitting (till, (lor argument fake)
that the constitution does allow an indivi

Provided this is the extent of the federal

iiaie equally as good a claim upon this state
as the lieir Â»f William Vajfall.
I have in the foregoing remarks endea
fouieti to state the fehtiments of the state
convention 011 this question ; to draw a
ililtinc'tiou between the sovereignty retained
and reli'iqtiillied ; what actions are cogniz
able Before the federal judiciary: and

| HAVE read with . t'ention the Various

through tke channel of newspapers, re-

If the proclamation had not been ptiblllhed
would the people of America have mifcon-

Some are of opinion that the republic of

order, and arrived here this evening with
their cannon and baggage. The French,
after having plundered the principal inha

It is very generally believed that the

that after tiie capture of Conde and Valen

[From a ]
1. "WIIf N an Attorney General is
brought forward, in an extra-official man
ner, to ' profane the facrcd h.dl of justice,'
with a political declamation, calculated to
alarm the fears of a jury, and to fnbllitute
political expediency lor jujlice and the taw
of tkt land; when the bench, instead of
prohibiting filch an unwarrantable pro
ceeding, not only listen to the declaiming
orator with pricked up ears, but after
wards addr.efs the jyry in terms equally
indecent and arbitrary, telling them, that
if they do not pronounce a fellow citizen
guilty, they are instrumental in plungiug
their country into ail .the horrors of war ;
in fine, when the mod alarming measures
are adopted, to ftifle the calls of justice,
and to intimidate an American jury into a
verdict consonant with the wid.es of a
court-party, or Britilh faction, it is high
time for the virtuous citizens of America
to be aroused to a sense of tiie daggers with
which one of their cleared privileges, that
of impartial trial by jury, is openly me
naced. In the indance alluded to, an in
dependent jury have firmly w ithdood the
violence of that ariltocratic torrent, whole
duices were opened upon tbcin ; they have
set hounds to the declamation of an attor
ney general, and to the sophisticated plead
ings (for pleadings they were) of an arbi
trary judge ; " thus far (hall your ratings
go, but no farther. 1 ' But, it is to be fear
ed, that further efforts w ill yet be made to
eftablilh tiie infamous dottrine, that Ame
rican citizens, (like feme European jub
je(ls) are /laves, attached to the foil 1 and
cannot, w ithoui leave from their 'matters,'
enter into the service of I ranee, or of any
other foreign power. Should the attempt
again be made. I trlift my fellow citizens
will repel it, 3s has already been done, with
the spirit of men who know the value oi
their privileges, and are determined to
guard them, with that patriotic jealoufv,
which ought ever to characterize the citi
zens of a iree country.
2. ' It is worthy of remark, that altho'
more than three months k-ne elapsed f nee
the PrefitKjit'Â» proclamation was liTue;! ;
and altlio' every governmental nerve has
bee n'ftraioed to induce the merchants of
America (who are, more thnn any o.her
class of citizens, friends to Great Britain)
to figuify tlleir approbation of the rata
lure; yet the number of those who have
'xpreffed that approbation, is compara
tively trifling. In Bcifton, before any vote
couid be carried, respecting the neutrality
declared by the proclamation, it wasfound
neceflary to premise a declaration, in which
the sacred obligation of our treaties w;u
fully recognized. And even then, the
meeting went 110 further than to express a
disapprobation of American citizens being
owners of privateers, employed to cruile
againlf any of the belligerent powers.â
1 hey, it seems, do not conceive i. a crime
in an American citizen t" enter into fo
reign ferriee ; else it is not likely that they
would have been lilent on a lubjec't of so
much importance."
3- Why are the devotees of a certain
party so arixioUs to hiive tne proclamation
echoed by every mercantile town in the
I Um:ed States ? Is it that ihe approbation
of a tew merchants may be fubUituted lor
the fanÂ£liÂ»>i of the American people, to
give fbme kind of force to a pusy inftru
| ment, which, in itfe-lf, is as totally devoid
of authority, as it is unauthorized by law ?
If, mllead oi convening Congress, tuis new
species of representation and legislation is
to be imputed upon us, would it not be
ecjuitble, rhat the agricultural interell
iiioul'l have a vo'ce in the business, as well
ls the mercantile i Surelv, if one c/a/j
ot citizens express their opinion, it is not
only proper, but necellary, that the opimoi]
ol ali Ihould be known. To eifect this de
sirable end, let meetings of the citizens be
immediately had, in convenient d.drifts,
â¢throughout the United States ; and let tne
general voice of America determine, as to
tne propriety of those measures, winch
have cither been enjuirted, or connived at,
by the executive, during theiall three or
four months.!

Captain Jol-.ua Bafney, who during the
late war commanded the Hyd r Ali, we
leain, from t> e befl authority, is arrived at
Baltimore, with ten men belonging to a
\ T ew Providence privateer, whom he cap
tured in the following manner :
On his voyage from Cajje Francois to
Oiitimor , off the Bite of Leogane, he
fel in with a Nt w-Providence privateer,
ivhich took his ship, the Ssmpfon, as hav.
nng French property on board. The
:aptors attempted to take Captain Bar
ney on board their vcflel, but he swore
:hey fl-.ould not t ike him out aliveâthat
ie would (lick by her while he had breath

lis vr/r.-l, wi h four of his men, and man.
led her with ten of their crew.
Capt. Barney sized a favourable mo

Britons boast of their humanity to pri
Pollers taken in war; what will their hearts
Feel when informed, that, to the disgrace
:>f our national chara&er, some French
prisoners have been so much neglected,
'hat, but for the merest accident they mull
abfoli'tely have perilhed with hunger?
Sir Richard Worfley, the commandant of
this pine , happening on Sunday to visit
the pi ifon here, found fix French prisoners,
ill officers, who from the time of being
cor.ftiuH, viz on the Friday preceding
had not tailed food of any kind, notwith
ila i ing repeated (olicitations; nor could
[hey hav procured any hut for his deter
mined interference. This ta e needs not
to be dwelt uponâevery feeling heart
must be filled with angtiifh at the bare re
:i *1 Sir Richard, wth that humanity
which is hisch rafteriltic, immediately re
iieved their d llrefs and ordered a proper
enquiry to be made into the abuse. This
bu .ness, of course, will be reported to the
duke 6f Richmond, and we hope the per
lons uho could be guilty of such inhu
manity, be they who they may, will re
ceive an exempl ry punilhment.
The daily r tions allowed to the priso
ners are only three quarters of a pound of
meat, ( ones Included) and three quarters
of a p.- und of verv coarse ill-baked breadâ
a small enough allowance 1 and fhou d they
be robbed of this icai.ty pittance with
impunity? In Irance, notwithflanding
the vail diffeeence in the present ci cuiii
(lances of the two countries, the daily al
lowance g'ven to Englilh prisoners, is
sixteen Fiench ounces, equal to seventeen
and an halt English, of meat, and a pro
portiunable quantity of good bread; and
it would be death to the villain who (Jiould
rob them of it. Is It possible that French
men, who are daily represented to us as
ravages and barbarians, can excel Britons
in generosity ! In humanity ! in julticc ?
