S /A.
ry ii r ;t letter was written and sent to
press on Friday lalt, too late to have a
chance of appearingjn Mr. 1" reneau's Ga
zette of Saturday, or according to the ge
neral rules of newspaper writers, I Ihould
have fe;it it to him tor publication. as your
jetters came out from his press, and the an-
Aver ought to folk w the lame course :
but lir, tne subject was important; your o
pmiuns, confined in the origin to a few,
were in danger ot spreading among that
uleful and valuable class of the coniniunity
who are not versed in the art of decepti
on, who not meaning themselves to de
ceive, are too apt to be imposed upon; lor
that realon only I deviated from a good
general tine, which always admits of ex
ception', and for the fake of ipeedy publi
cation fcnt my letter to Mr. Dunlapâl
now proceed through the fame channel to
take some notice of your third letter.
Your tirit paragraph is exactly in the
stile and manner of your two preceding
favours ; puffed up with your own imagi
;-iry importance, you think you should be
guil tv of treafou if you did not volunteer
it, by otf.ring yonrfell" as the l'relident's
counsellor, to warn him to dtfmifs those
whom the conllitution acknowledges, and
whom tue Senate of the United States
hive approved. You remind him that he
)â¢> a servant whose conduct is to be govern
ed by the will of rile people, as expreil'ed
in the laws & the conltitution ; and with
out entering into any argument, or giving
him anv advice, you proceed to examine
a id cross-examine him, as if he were a
witness in a court of juflic*, in order to
get from his own mouth something to cri
nii late his character and dellroy the force
of his evidence, or by his silence, to pre-,
fume his guilt.
I liave never been intruded with any
secrets of the (late, nor can 1 anlwer any
oueition which relates to the internal con
tiuft of the cabinet; but 1 think your quef
tio is are of such a nature, thai any mail
who had been in this country but a (hurt
time would not have alked them, nor could
have been at a loss for answers to them.
We know, lir, th3t the emperor of Ger
many and the king of Pruflia, who engag
ed in the war witii France some time ago,
never sent an armed (hip into the Ameri
can seas, and that America hns net Tent a
Ihip of war into the European leas ; so that
there could be no poflible need of a pro
clamation of neutrality in 1792. But, lir,
in April 1793, after France had declared
â war againlt Britain, Holland and thefove
veign city of Hamburgh; when a like de
claration was hourly expected aj-ainlt
Spain and Portugal, and which have since
come out, all of those.nations with whom
the United States have a constant inter
course, whose liiips are frequently vilitino
our ports, and ours, theirsâl fay, lir, tha:
in \pril 1793, the French frigate PEm â¢
b ifcade arrived at Charleston, and landed
Mr. Genet, ambaH'ador from the republic
of France to wurs. Advices received Irorr
thence announced, that private vessels were
taking commitlions from the French am.
balFad'or, to cruise in our Teas, against al
the enemies o> France, many of whon:
were our allies. This was the moment
when it became the duty, of the President,
the guardian of the honour and fafety oi
the United Hates during the recess ot Con
gress, to come forward with a proclamati.
011, warning the citizens of the conse
quence of their joining in hostilities againtl
any of the belligerent powers. This, lir.
is a good reafou why the proclamation was
not i(Tiled before, and why it was ifiued al
the time it bears date.
You fay, "The onduct of our govern
ment, with relpect to Great Britain, has
*or some years part been (hamefully pufil
-1 r.imous," and immediately proceed tc
acknowledge that you do not know what
it has been ; you boldly call for a publica
tion of their councils, in order that you
m;*y know whether you have charged them
wiu'i or without foundation ; and then hold
out the idea, that it w ill be juitifi ble for
the people to take the law into their own
hands, and make war without the leave 01
the persons to which the constitution has
cnti ulVed that prerogative. This hint, lir,
approaches much nearer to treafou than
your not warning the firft magistrate, as
mentioned in your exordium
Your next paragraph is an extraordinary
one indeed. You fay that, "Since writing
your lull,you have learned with regret that
Bhofe citizens who complain that oiy trea
ties with France were violated bv the pro
elaniation, couitl'ued it "Pray, fir,
S A T U E. D A Y, June 22, 1793.
let me afl; you how you dare to write you
two preceding letters, before you at 4e.i(
enquired, whether ilie proclamation reali;
was a violation of the treaties or riot:
Had you made the enquiry fill 1 , and beei
uiilintormed, you might have the excufi
>f ignorance, which, tho' a lame one
night have keen given as a palliation
ut 11 )w, in your th rd letter, to come lor
ward and acKiiow ledge that your informa
ton Â« ,:s polVerior to your 111 ode It atra<l
upon the J'refident. deferv'es a severer re
proof chan I am accustomed to give to anj
Dddy.
\oi r ignorance of treaties, of the law
ofnat c and nations.of tile condtV&of go
veriiifi. t, and of tlie wefckrefs of your
own tfii ts. would have rendered youi
perforni.il.ces mm orthy of any answer, .1
there was not lomithing due to the mi
vary citizens, vt ho might have been mi fief
by fonie 'igh founding phrases, which yot
have borrowed from other wii*er c l ir.ai
thprefore p oceed, inttead of folljwinj
your aMurdicies, to inform my fellow citi
zens. us well as I am able, on the lubject:
you seem so incapable to treat of.
By tile 17th articl- of the treaty of an i
ty and commerce w i France, provifioi
is made that, "It Ihouid be lawful lor tlif
Ihips of war of i irlier ir; , and privateer:

coiiinai ders of fu-h Ihips of war ill all be
obi i,c ;l to (iieW
Now, fir, there is no lung in all this that
iii.thoi izes a Freiuh fliip of war or priva
teer to bring or P'lid her prizes into any o
our ports tor sale, but o lyforfafety, and
to proceed away with theiw, when they
(hall think proper ; tliey come in, in poÂ«-
fellion of thein, and we are not to enquire
mto the legality of their pollitllions; we
are to suppose they h*ve aright to them
because they are the oflenlible owners;
and if tiiey t ike them away as they came,
there is an end to the butinefs. But ii they
will land the cargoes and advertile those
and the reffels for sale, the cal'e is altered.
No man can prevent another, in any free
neutral country from demanding or filing
for his property ; if therefore the captors
of those prizes have gone further than the
treaty authorizes, the former owners or
their agents, being here, have a right to go
into our courts of law to claim their pro
perty; and this is all that I can learn has
been done. In the very paper that con
tained your third letter is a paragraph in
these words "the (hip Willam captured by
the French privateer. Citizen Genet, and
the brig Fanny, a prize to the Sans Culot
tes have been libelled against by their for
mer owners as illegal prizes." This in
formation you might have had before yon
wrote, as it had been in prior papers ; and
altho' no man is bound to enquire, or know
all the tranfaclions in a large city, yet it is
certainly the duty of every man to inform
himfelf well upon any fubjeft on which he
is about to w rite and make a clamor ; bad
ynu taken this precaution, you mult be ex
tremely ignorant indeed, it you would not
have been (atisfied that such a proceedinp
was according to the law of nations, ant:
not incowlifteiit with any treaty, by the
law of nations foreigners have a right tc
sue and may be sued in the courts of justice
of any civilized power: and the only plea
that can be made to the disability of the
complainant in this refpe.fl is, that he is ar
alien enemy : if we did not admit this pri
vilege, our country would soon be the afy-
pirates, robbers, infolveiv
debtors and fugitives from jullice, ot al
other countries. As this fubjett appear:
now to be before the proper tribunal to tri
the legality of the capture, I am not at li
berty to treat of it ; it is contrary to law tc
bias the public mind by efl'ays or diflerta
tions in newspapers. The cause is to be
tr.ed in court, and not by the people in the
campus martins ; the court is to be open ;
the people may attend in as great numbers
as the walls of the house will contain :
council will be heard on both fides, andthe
court will publicly pronounce a decree ;
this is the mode pointed out by our conlli
tution, and the laws of the land, and no
country can be denominated free cither
w here juflice is administered in private, or
where the catife can be drawn from the
judges and tried bv the people at large ; or
in newfpapcrs. I am warranted in this
doctrine by the decision of our supreme
court anil general allembly in the cafe of a
printer in this city of a recent date.
The fame reaion prevents me from en
tering into the cafeof the '-two men, for
merly citizens of the United States, but
lately in the lervice of France, who have
beenfeized and thiovvn into jail, to be tri
ed hy our laws for a violation of the neu
trality declared in your proclamation.
The law will determine whether they have
violated it or not, and i Ihoulil not attempt
to pubiilh my opinion, if I had formed ont
on the subject which I have not. But 1
cannot pass over your manner of bringing
this matter forward ; your
tiat it is fur breach "of the
dared by the Prelident s proclamation,'' is
equivocal, and may b< iwiirtrued in two
ways ; I should have taken the mod fa
vourable one, to have been your meaning,
if you had not otherwise coiiltrued it
yoni I'elf in the fame letter, w here you fax
"permit me to afkfir, whether you think
yoiirfelf verted with legal powers to an
not folemw treaties by proclamation ?"
Thisevidcntlj'fheus that you meant to in*
(innate tlvat the offence charged oil these
men the proclamation, and not
againd the neutrality ; and is a proof how
little you know, or how little you regard
truth, which >ou have afiumed as your fig
rnttnre. 1 told you, in my former letter,
that proclamations did not make law, and
tnat the Prefideni had attempted 110 such
tiling ;& I (hali not rilk, with any body but
join fclf, or your coadjutors if you have a
ny, the being called a sycophant" by fay
ing that.this is a base attempt to cajumi-
charafler that, 1 trull, is above the
reach of anj of your pc/'foneil arrows.
The treaty with Britain pnd the conduff
of the British towards us would require an
efiay or perhaps a volume by itfelflotlo
the subject judice; and I have neither time
nor inclination to undertake the work;
the truth is that I ?m of opinion with Field
ing, ' that a man may either write or fptnk
the better for underdanding the fubjefl,''
and it would take a good deal 0} time, to
collect ftfhcient materials for undertaking
filch a work ; but I can fee plainly enough
that you know nothing about the mattei.
The treaty Sir, contains reciprocal engag
ments, and I have heard that they have
been the fubjeft of much corre'pondence be
tÂ« een theminiffers of the tw opowers; that
much arguments has been uied 011 both
fides, and that neither can, or does, boast
of a compleat victory over the other. The
subject is an extremely delicate one for a
newspaper; and as I am too good a citi
zens, to betray any interest of my country
for any confederation whatever, I don't like
to repeat, even what I have heard of, the
arguments nfed by the Briti'fh; especially
in a controvcrfy with you, lead in my
warmth of anf\\ering you, I might con
cede more than is proper for any private
citizen to do ; for a private citizen, tho'
wholly unknown, may drop a hint or dart
an argument, that the other fide may make
some advantage of. I fliall therefore only
fay, that the Britilh have given some rea
sons for not evacuating the north-weflern
ports, that have at leart plausibility on their
iide, and that they have been anfvvered by
persons, who underlland the fubjeft with
great ability. Wherefore I think that you
and I had better leave the matter to be
fettled, by those to svhoin the constitution
and laws of the land, haVe intruded the
important duty of making treaties; we can
do them no good by our canvassing the fub
jeÂ£t, and we may lay them under tmbar
raflinents.
And here Sir, I fliall dismiss you alto
gether had not 1 seen your lart w orus in
the National Gazette of yederday, and
your request to have your works republilh
ed in the Daily Advertiser. What you
could expert from this but to render your
enmity to the government, under -which
yon enjoy the liberty of doing it, more
confpicucus, I cannot conceive, for there
is not through the whole course of your
labours a scattered fragment, of truth, in
formation or argument. Tlie w hole are
a pompous farrago of nonfenle, mifmfor
mation and daclamation, wholly inapplica
ble to the present date of the Union; there
are 110 such lordliligs and sycophants as
you describe ; there is 110 attempt to shac
kle you from Ipeaking your mind upon
my fubjeÂ£t, and vor.liung up the gall
[Total Numb. 172.]
which overflows from your disordered
bladder, there is no cry on the part of go
vernmant, that it is In danger, nor any art
used to mislead the people in its favour
"Good wine needs no bufli" and a jjood jc
vernment needs no panegyrists, hence every
thing goes on quietly, its friends reicice i s
this quiet; &tho' they have no objection to
any man writing and publifhiug his senti
ments, yet for the reputation ot the coun
try, they wilh and recommend truth ami
decency to accompany them ; this is all
they wifii or have ,a right to recommend.
And now Sir, I am ready to give you n<<-
last words, they are upon the base attempt
in your last performance to mislead unwa
17 citizens into falfe jealousy, upon the fub
jeft of an entertainment given by the Bri
tilli minister, on his king's bit th d/.y, anil
the toatts there given. I fliould be nlait
Sir, to know, what bufineU it is to you,
nr-oi? that occalion ? It is trip
. onlfant custom cf British fubjedi, every
where, to give the king, whose pay they re
reive, for their firft toalt after dinner ,
md upon the occalion of his birth day, it
would have been conflrued into diiafcei
tion, and marked difrtlj to have o
mittcd it. if they had the politeness to
i>ive the President of the United States al
terwnrds, it is plain you would be behind
:hem in 1 his instance of refpeÂ£t to him. Sir,
your sentence on tiiis fubjeft, is contradic
tory to itfelf ; you firft approve the senti
ment, which yon fay has been adopted bv
some lately, "that principles and* not men,
should be the object of republican attach -
ment," which plainly proves that your ob
jection was to drinking the 1 resident all;
Mid you immediately beiome so careful of
l her President's dignity, that you csll it ail
r.fult to drink him in such company ; Jiere
Sir, you fliew the cloven foot: what riglic
lave you to talk of insulting the President;
your letters pnbiifhed in the A. Dai. Adver
ser of this day, answer the qi.eftion to your
frame.âKvery thing Sir, fhotld be taken
as it was intended. The British minlnfter
.bought he was paying refpeft to the coun
ty in which he enjoys the rights of hofpita
ity by giving its President in Inch company
it his master and family; no\v, tho' there is
e*Hy nothing in it, but a token ot good
Â« ill, I think if you and I don't (pel h;*ps for
<ery different real'ons) civufe to drink the
President's health, ourselves, \\ e ought rot
:o prevent those who chufe to pay him this
mark of refpeft, by eflablifhing an inqui
ition over the table, and convivial char or'
ill the foreign fr.bjetts and citizens and of
di the ciubs, focicties and convivial meet -
ings among us, for they all do what gives
you so much offence, that is they give theii
"overeigivainr, nation or patron for the fir.'i
:oa(t, alter which mojl of thcin give the
Pretident of the United States.
I Ihould not have thought this fuMrfl
worth mentioning amidst such a croud of
irtpoi'tant ideas as your publication excite,
had your sentiments been confined to this
lountry; but having appeared in two
newspapers, which travel the world over,
1 thought it would conduce to the honor
of the 1 nited States to fend along with
your's the opinion of a citizen differing
from von in the principleof foreign liberty',*
and while 1 am asserting the liberty of
"peech, & the liberty of the prefs.todrop a
tew words in faviAir cf the liberty of the
:able.
I dismiss you now with a short piece of
id vice ; in your next attempt at writing,
Jo not ape the Itiie and manner of Junius';

GeNeraj.,
THE Citizen Deputies, to whom yen

ties to fulfil, the fatre oaths to keep, ami
we are polfelTed of the fame powers, dele
gated from the National Rreprefentative
of the republic.
General, we agree with yon, that to dif
fer in opinion is no crime ; for a crime, ac
cording to the law, is attached only to ac
tion ; and it is only for actions which art
criminal and traitorous in the eyes of all
nations, and even in yours, that Dnmoutiei
has rendered l.imfelf infamous and a trai
tor ; whilst he might have covered hi in fell
with glory in ufefully forving his country,
and in dying in its defence if necrfl'ary.
It was certainly a great crime to pietenc
to oppose his own Will to that of the nation
and to pro-pose to them any governmen
whatever. The will of a General of ai
:rmy, ill oppoliticm to legal authorities, e
ven if good, can be nothing but a violatior
ot all principles, and a great crime againl 1
National Sovereignty. But what did Gen
eral Dumonrier v illi for ? The faflic thai
our mod inveterate enemies now with for
viz. To seduce our troops, to direst then
against their country, to give us a new ty
ranny, and to league themselves with oui
enemies, in order to accoinplilh these de
ligns. What more could Dunioilrier havi
done ? Has guilty La Fayette, whom ht
himfelf condemned to infamy, done an;
thing else ? Has not he himl>!f sworn si
tlelity to the republic, and for this oath ob
tained the confidence of the French ? You
General, reap the advantages of his perfidy
laut you do not pardon him for the fame
The Conditution, which, jou (ay was oncc
our idol, fell into ruins by the endeavour:
i>f those events who willi for it now, am

We know of no division amonjft the

" Having learnt thatfufprcions have beer

of a pretended connection supposed to exill
between me and Philip d'Orltans, a Frencl
prince, too well known under the name o
Egalite, and being anxious to preserve tha
eiteem of-which I daily receive the mof
honorable teilimonies, I take the earlief
opportunity of declaring that I am ignoran
whether there daily exists an Orlean fac
tion ; that I never had any connÂ«Â£tior
with the Prince who is supposed to be a:
the head of it, or who is the pretence foi
it; that I never elteemed him ; and thai
(ince the fatal epoch when he tore afundei
the bonds of blood and offended agaimt al
known laws, by criminally voting for the
death of theunfortunateLouis XVI againfl
whom he declared his opinion with atruciou
impudence, my contempt for him has beer
changed into a jull aversion, which leaves
me no other deiire than that of feeing him
delivered over to the severity of the laws.
" With regard to his children, I think
they poliefs as many virtues as he does vi
ces. They have perfeitly served their
country in the armies which I commanded,
without ever (hewing ambition. I have a
great friendlhip for the eldell, founded up
on the best merited cfteem ; and 1 am cer
tain, that, instead of ever afpiringto mount
the Throne of France, he would fly to the
end of the world, rather than be forced to
It. In (hort, I declare, that if, after the
crimes of his father, or by the attrocious
results of the sons of faction and anarchy,
he (liould find himfelf in such a (ituation as
to wave between the virtues which he has
hitherto Ihewn, and the bafenef. of taking
advantage of the dismal cacai'trophe which
has plunged the sensible part of the Nation
and all F.urope in mourning, and that if he
(hould then be ever so far blinded by am
bition as to aspire at the crown, I would
devote him to eternal hatred, and enter

Frankfort, April 20, 1793. [Â£â  Paper.]
For the National Gazette.
Mr. Freneau,
A MONC the many murders committed
by the Paris mob, in the course of the
present revolution, that of Madam Lam
balle is the inort affecting: and which with
out any reason, has given the friends of
despotism and monarchy, such cause of re
flection on the whole nation.
To ascribe however, such an occurrence,
which can beconlideied in no other light
than as the action of an enraged and
opprefied multitude, to the grand coun
cil of the nation, as has been done by
many, is the greatelt absurdity. And if it
be asked why were not forae attempts made
by the police of the city, to prevent the
commiffiau of inch an action, I answer that
they as well as every other person knows,
the difficulty and danger of oppoling a mob,
and that it was certainly far better to let
them have their own way, rather than
risque those greater evils and general
(laughter which would have inevitably fol
lowed. I would beg leave to remind the
Englilh nation, who have made the greatest
noise about the matter, of the mob in Lon
don in 1780, which all the military that
eould beco.lected could not prevent them
committing far more numerous and atroci
tus actions than ever were done in Paris,
and from pulling down the house and burn
ing all the valuable property of one of the
kighelt men at that time in power; viz.
Lord Mansfield. Let them alio remember
the more recent affair at Birmingham, a
rot unequalled in hiflory, and which was
countenanced by government, when it
might have been quelled 111 timeâF-lfe why
were not some effectual measures taken be
fore three d ivs had elapsed, during which
time the mob ravaged without oppolition,
and were flittered to destroy the iioute
br sry, and valuable philolophical apparatus
of Dr. PrielHy, a nun to whom EnglÂ® ll "
nwes the greatelt part of her fame among
;!ie nations of the world, for the numerous
and important discoveries in pliilofophy and
:hc lciences In general ; and whole luU'es
ivill forever remain a /landing tnouinnent
if di[grace to the Briti/h nation.
But to return âAlthough Madam Lam
bille's death will no doubt be lamented
from the circumstances oÂ»/y which attended
it, (for cohlidering the intiigucs 2nd mon-
Itron; extravagance of which (he was guil
ty, her life was rather a cnrfe than a prWfit
to the nation.) Yet to (hew how little
principle (lie pofleifed, I fend you a letter
written by her, ridiculing the venerable
Doifor Franklin at that time, our ambafta
:'or at Versailles, 011 his firft introduction to
the qneeri at her leVee, and which is only
on 1 par with that profligacy ot manners,
and life of which (lie was notoriously guilty
âlt is extracted from a number ot other
letters, which were written in France, and
intercepted and pub'illied in England.

T Am but just returned from a tedious le

a sincere head-ach might plead my txcufe

But I know you are anxious to hear how

âBut indeed you mwft thank the countess
Jule de Polrgnac and nie for itâfor it was
no easy matter to perfuaile her mnjelty to
endure them The countess and myfelf
Hood very dtJfe to her by way of precau
tion. Unluckily, madamoijelle Berfin had
been with her all the morning, and you
know luivv tne milleners abhor an Englilh

so humourouflv. that, when they made
their entree, her rnajefty was very neat
laughing.âThe truth is, my dear trierftl.
they were villainouflv drelTed ; and I don't
know how it happened, but none of tlieni
looked like gentlemen. It was all in vain
to talk of simplicity of manners ! of great
ness of mind ! and contempt of forms !
" Ma foi (d:t la reine) it faut avouer ce
tfeft que de la ca' aille /"f However, I
pointed to Dr. Franklin's white hat, as the
emblem of innocence ; and the countess
of Polignac to his fpeÂ£tacles, (one of which
was broken) as tnat of oeconomy. As
suredly, said her majeftjr, thisdodtor Frank
lin is " bien fingulier en toutes chose.' !
We lauged at this turn, which put ker in

who was (landing by, allured her niajefty
that this singular doctor, with his white

theless bottle lightening, and uncork it a?
fatally as Pandera opened her box, or
Ulyfl'es's friends untied the boraccio ; at
which we all laughed ; becanfe none of us

COOL REFLECTIONS relative to
the FRENCH REVOLUTION.
TXfHATEVER may be the ifTue of the
present awful contest for liberty in
France, it has "produced one effect here
that ought not to be overlooked, or soon
forgotten. It has been the means of try
ingâthough not the foulsâyet the princi
ples of men ; and thereby clearly ascer
tained who have been friends, and who
have been enemies, to the progress of li
berty there ; and eonfequently who are
real friends and real enemies to it here.
The line partially and faintly drawn before
Dy other circum(tances< has been traced out
fully and clearly, by the infallible signs of
triumph and sorrow attending the alter
nate fuccefles and misfortunes of the arms
ofliberty. There is hardly a man of any
consequence among us, who has not exhi
bited himfelf in his true colours, In this re
spect. And it is a fair and sure conclusion,
that thoje who have uniformly been again It
the French revolution, or wtjh well to the
de/pots employed in overturning the new
republic, are at heart inimical to liberty
and the rights of the people in their own
country.
As to the unprincipled trimmers and
time-servers, it is of some importance also
that their charaÂ£ters have been brought
fully to light. And as to the timid and
uniteady, driven to and fro by every vague
rumour, and every turn of fortune, the
lead they can expect is, to be regarded as
very weak, rather than wicked, members
of society.
The influence of events on the opinions
and sentiments of mankind, is an old and
important obfervaticn, and too ninth oc
calion ior repeating it lias been afforded
among ouifetver, during the French revo
lution. And yet it feenis furpriling that
ihe ordinary rare of underflanding, lirm
nefs, and integrity of the people of this
country, fimuld not have mc.de the remark
inapplicable to our fltuation. How obvious
is it, to reflect, that force is noteft of right,
and confeqtfeiuly that whether the French
succeed in their struggles for liberty, or be
overpowered by the tyrannical confederacy
against tliem, the nature and merits Of the
cause in which they are engaged nuift re
main the faine. Had America not suc
ceeded in her strugglesâhad the powers
which Great-Britain now joins against
France, joined her in the war against us,
and had been able to crulh our liberty in its
birthâor, were liberty to be exterminated
entirely from the face of the earth, it would
not alter the nature of things. It would
'lot make tyranny less an evil, nor liberty
less a blefllng, than they riow are; nor
could the opinion or inclination of any ra
tional mind be changed or influenced by so
deplorable an event. For my own part,
whenever my imagination, looking for
ward to the great scene of poflible events,
prefects to me new fuccefles of tyranny â
the chains of France rivetted on her âand
liberty hunted out corner of Eu
ropeâtheeffeit is far different on my mind.
Instead of changing my opinion concern
ing the nature of that blefling, or being less
anxious to nourilhit and preserve it among
otirfelves, its value feenis to rife morepre
c'ous in Hiy eyes, and I feel a more anima
ted anxiety that it may be watched and
guarded 011 every fide, and against every
danger.

The late accounts from Franee, contain
upon the whele favourable appearances
relpefting the cause in which they are en

in which they have beengenerally repulsed

Oftend papers, even mention in terms of
ftirprize and regret, the objiinate reliftance
made to the operations of the combined
armies. Gen. Danip>erre is busily employed
in organizing the army which Dumourier
by his treachery had in some measure put
in confution, and from the number ot
recruits daily coming in, there was every
appearance of his collecting a fufficient bo
dy effectually to oppose the inroads of
the enemy, and perhaps in due time to
drive them from the frontiers.

The commercial credit of Great Britain,
from the war it is engaged inâthe want of

fuffered a severe fliock. To remedy the
evil, an ast palled the Rritifli Parliament,
for the loan of Exchequer Bills, to the a
inount of five millions sterling : on the de

GERMANTOWN MEETING.
As it has been surmised that the pra

cured from Thomas Dunga:i, chairman,
and in the hand-writing of Mr. Franks,
secretary to the said meeting âWhatever
merit is due to l*4r. Forreft for his two
resolutions, we find he can claim no merit,
for the third resolution ; the sole object of
which was to make the proceedings of the
meeting public.

Mr.FRENEAU,
THE total condemnation of the pro
ceedings of the French republic, by
the inhabitants of this part of the (late, i 1
very aftonif.iing The king is here la
nented in words expreflive of the moll fen
llble anguish ; our prints are conftantl;
conveyin â¢ to us paragraphs replete wits
sorrowâl am led to conjedlure that they
would be placed round with black, if d â 
collation (Wild be the happy and honor
able fate of ihe great and illullrious Ar
nold, whose greateit crimes are nothing in
consequence, or in numbers when corr.pa
red with ihofe of the great benevolent and
sincerely regretcd despot: Even then Ar
no'rf would soon fink into oblivion, but
the (ufferings of the latter are induilrioufiy
and perfeveringly presented to our feelings.
View the former, as the American H;n
nibal; view him at Quebec, on the lakes,
md near Saratoga ; contidcr hiin at Welt
PointâSee Louis afiiiling us on the ere
of our well known emancipation, or humb
ling an inveterate foe and eternal rivalâSee
him granting his fubjefts privileges to aug
nent his cxhaufled icvenueâfee him at
V.riail'.es ; at the Champs de Mar; on his
flight ; as the private supporter of the em
bodied fugitives at or near Coblents ; as
he retainer of a few Swift, to guard 24
millions of bis peopleâthe 10th rtugult.
However a tamous exciseman fays, ' that
for a people to be free it is fufEcient that
thev mean it.' It evidently follows t'sat i 1
a people w\Jh to be governed in any othei
manner they ought to be gr.itifi-'d.
Not interelledly, but with the good oI
the people at heart, I am now preparing :
form of government which I am convincet
will be congenial with the fouls of my fel
low c'tizms, ('/Ã¼bjefls I will hereafter fav (
and wh'ch I will Pnorlly favour the work
with Lead I may heighten curiosity toe
much, shall now submit the outlines to then
consideration. The present Hate of S.
Carolina shall henceforth be
an independent kingdom ; in which on<
king (no matter if a kin to the interl pel
Bute) under the check of I;o hereditary
lords and 200 commons, elected every ij
years. Everv person without dillindbor
may be an eleÂ£V>r, provided he aÂ£tua"lly
enjoys 501 sterling annually, landed pro
perty. I fear 1 shall anticipa emy futurt
plan, therefore (hall only observe, that this
royal fabric is to be rai ed on the now con
jealed b'ood of the Cowpens, Camden, and
Eutaw Springs.
Pray, Sir, enquire if it is common 01
singular, that S. and E. merchants not
conten ed with rifling our pock-ts and
daily Llling our lands and negroes, mult
alio here tellify their contempt of our pre
sent republican government, in an indireit
way, by so ar lently and pointedly con
demning and deriding the only other form
in the universe which befers any resem
blance to it.

From the New-York Journal.
IT is laughable to observe the zeal which
the pretended neutrals among us evince,
whenever an opportunity offers of crimina
ting our brave defenders, the enlightened
republicans of FranceâTo every honest
American, it mufl appear manireft that ail
their infernal machinations only tend to
create a jealousy between the two friendl*
republii s, which, clad in the robes of li
berty, dart their effulgent rays throughout
the globe âAmericans, be liberal,be peace
able, and be juil!âRemember when your
wives, your daughter, your motiiers, nÂ« G
your fillers were torn from youâwhen
your houses and barns were destroyed, and
your chi drtn fcalpcd and butchered, wlio
Itood between you r.nd the clankinj* chains
of British ministerial despotism. In re
fpedi to the proclamation of the Prehdent,
it only amounts to thisâThat we are de
firoris of remaining in peaceânot that we
are to become the dupes of ingriies among
us, who, like the serpent did to Eve, would
fawn, and cringe, and gi'in, and lie, ?nd
flitter us to our ruin. Cliarafters of this
cast take the lead among us. Tiiey are
iicn pushing their malevolent faces into all
circles, and, like true imps, whisper into
:; jr ears, that to become great and happy,
we must join their good king, and affilt in
rutting the throats of our allies. They ai
ftrft a llrong liking to the neutrality, but
it is only when put in force againlt the
French. If a native of, and friend to A
merica, lisps out in a feeble voice, grati
tude at lead should induce m to wi(h well
to Fr inceâ he is spurned at, and to'd, that
lie fiiouid beware of offending Britain; that
the French, because they have beheaded
iheir king, are brutes, fivages, and infidels.
These men are endeavouring to procure
addresses to that brave republican, the
worthy execut ve of our Hate, with the base
Intention of warping the national fenti
ment. Because we have been generous e
tough to remain inactive, they wi 1 not al
ow us an opinion. What a phenomenon
n politics, that men, not citizens of this
country, but who are only British agents,
"ent here with the avaricious design of
greying upon our commercial vitals, & ex
panding the wealth of our country, should
je fuffered to take the lead in forming our
opinion, and dictating what ought
o be the conduct of a free, a great, and a
jratefu 1 people! L;t us. by o'.r demeanor,
â¢nake it known to ill men, th-it, while we
prefer a Hate of neutrality and peace, yet
ve cannot but f el a i anxious f ilicitude for
lie success of the glorious flruggles which
he Frtnch people ate maki ig, to o'o
ain t'n?t heavenly jewel which wefojullly

:iuc temper, we never will be found under
