Happy, thr'.ce h 'pay Americans ? our
revolution was effeiicd at an enlightened
period of the world ; at a period when
tile Rignts of Ma i were perfectly un.l r
flood, and the tovereignty of the people
reco.rnifed Our revolution was fouiuiecl
on thepnreit principles of liberty and equa

and the fovereijnty ot th people eft ib

of relllef ambition, tnirll of dominati

Sent'e, under the invincible r-iflue ice o
unerring Reason, that American Idol, a
gainlt whose empire all the tyrants or the
earth have confederated and war in vain,
at whose llirine Defnocs tremble.
Citizens, when, m the course ol hnmai
events, it becti nes ncceflarv tor one
pie to difl'olve the political bonds,
h ire connected them with another, and ti
ta.ee their Ita'.ion among the nations of the
earth, to which the law of nature, and ol
nature's God, equally entitles them ; a de
cent refpeil for the opinions of mankind,
requires, that they Ihonld declare the
causes which impel ihem to the reparation.
This truth is felf-evident, that all mei
are by nature eq lal, that they ire endowee
by their Creator, with certain imprescript
ible, and unalienable rights ; amongthefe
are life, liberty, and the pursuit of hap
piness ; that, to secure those rights, go
vernments are instituted among men, de
riving ail their power from the fovereigi
will of he people: that whenei er any lorn
of government becomes definitive o
thole ends, it is the undoubted right, i
is the indifpenf ible duty of the people ti
alter, or, to abolifli it, and to iuflitute :
new government, laying its foundation or
such principles, and organizing its powei
in such form, as (hall bed secure theii
fafety and happiness. Prudence dilates,
that revolutions Uiouid not be attempted
on light or rranfient cases, and the expe
rience of all ages proves, that mankind arc
more disposed to bear, while evils are fut

Citizens, such was the p t.ent ln..er

the support of the fame declaration, rely

Citizens, this was the ast that broke the
chains of Britiih tyranny, and delivered
us from worse than Egyptian bondage.
This was the aÂ£t that declared the Rights

by acting offenlively, have fofeited evtry

they are entitled to. This is a falfe affec

place, the king, in conjun&jon with the

Anuria and Pi tiflia to acl lioftilcjy against

But a people, a free republic, 11111 ft not

treacherous princeâA prince ! how it
founds! what a charm does it convey !
This specimen of the works of Pacificus i:
ftifficient to convince us, that he toufiders
the nation of France .as a herd of wild
beasts, against whom every prince and
every mail may.lift his arm with impunity ;
and that were we to entertain a friendly
f.'ii'iment refpccting them, we would be

" becanfe their form of government has

pitiful fubt-rfiige; the amount of it is, that
because the people of France have de
stroyed the balfile and tyranny, and fired
vith our example, have ertabltlhed liberty
on their ruin-, we have nothing to do with
them : But I would atk the courtly Paci
fictn, whether the pecuniary obligation;
that we are under to France, have un

the people of America adopted the iipÂ«

he is also an inherent great man, I dial
offer him one from an author of the highell
repute, namely, Montelquieu ; this greut
politician in his Spirit of Laws, vol. i page

court s of princes, fufficient to make then:
od'ous to every ilit n who has a regard to
the principles of honor and virtue. "Aei

this representation may be applied to Pa

fpeet to the proclamation Â»i the President.
and all the little etceteras appertaining to
it; the good sense of the Americans will
direct them to fee I and judge for them
ielves. it is my wifli to lliade every anti
republican trait in the character of the
man who was firm to his country during a
perilous war : With such councilors,a:
Pacificus near his person, it is not furpr;-
ftng, that he lliould sometimes ait contrary
to the fentiinents of the people. The
lplendor of departments and the pompou?

which his silvered eloquence evades.
SECRETARIUS.
For the National Gazette.
Mr. Freneau,
â J HAVE heard nothing mere regretted bj
-*â¢ the best friends of our country, than the
manner adopted in publilhing the opinion
of the judges Â«l" the supreme court of the
United States, on the molt important quel
tion which ever did. or ever will, conn
before that judicature, viz. Thefuabilitj
of a state, in that court, by a citizen of an
other (fate. Sojnft, so wife, so importao
a decision, could not have been inarle tor
pub.ic : The refpeftive opinions of the
judges, ought to have been inserted a
large, in all the news-papers throughou
the continent; and this would undoubtedly
have been the cafe, had not a copy-righi
been made of them. Good policy woult
have induced an unlimited publication
hut a more effectual mode could not hav<
been adopted, than the one chosen, to pre
vent these important opinions from beint
read by the great body of the people : A
large pamphlet, price 50 cents, was made
Â® them, and claimed as a copy-right, ii
order to prevent their being republiihed ii
â the gazettes : Whereas tney ought to have
been public property, that they might be
JMiblilhed in a fix-penny pamphlet, and ii
all the news-papers, in order that the great
body of citizens might be informed of the
great principles of this important decision.
As an individual citizen, I hope it is not
_yet too late ; and that the judges, at tlieit
ensuing session, will direct their opinions,
at large, to be published in the news-paper:
of your city, that the claim of a copy
right therein may be withdrawn, and that
public notice thereof may be given, to the
end that the Peopie may have the neceffarj
information, whereby to judge of the me
*iitated alteration in the conllitution of the
"United Statei, by the enemies of Equality :
Por my own part, I have never yet heard
a good reason afligned, why a fraudulent
state lhould not be amenable to juitice, as
well as a fraudulent individual ! for such
we know there are.
Be pleased to give these observations a
place in vour next gazette, and oblige

It is said from the time the Boston fri

-I'ew had no idea that the Ambuscade
would fight them, in the manner (he did,
Gapt. Courtnay having been informed that
ill citizen Kompard's officers were infirm
ild men. without spirit er abilities to com
nand a vigorous attack. After engaging
ivithin about a cable's length far near an
lour, Capt. Courtnay, who was the life
ind foul of the action fell, the whole bac><
'art ol his head being carried away, sup
posed by a 12 pound ball, which also killed
:he lieutenant of marines. Both were
inftatitlv thrown overboard, as were all the
athers that were killed, without the ce
remony of sinkers. A prisoner, lieutenant
Whitney, who was 011 board the Boston
during the engagement.has given it a hi?
opinion that, from the determined conduct
of Courtnay, had he survived, he would
hare funk with his frigate rather than have
Surrendered, or fled from tlie Ambuscade.
He /lad no sooner fallen than the firft lieu
tenant took the command, altho' previ
oufly wounded, with a long splinter which
beinp driven in a horizontal direction thro'
tne (lefliy part of his nose, thÂ»re lodged,
remaining fixed femething in the manner
of a (hip's fpritfail yard. From this time
it is said the action visibly declined, & the
crew soon ifter demanded either a retrea
or furrendenthe former was preferred,tht
Bolton carrying ail the fail file could make
which was little more than that on hei
foremafts. The masts of the Ambuscade
were so much wounded (as mentioned ii
our last) that she eould not carry fail fuf
ticient to overtake the Bolton, without a
certaintly of carrying them overboard;
upon which (he tacked, took a Portuguese
arig that was in fight, and returned to
N'ew-York. The number of killed on
joaicl the Boston are not yet certainly
cnown : the conjeÂ£tures are, from 22 to
54. The peopte on board the Ambuscade
.ounted 2 1 dead bodies floating in the Bof
:on'swake. A crow-bar was found (tick
ing in the Bolton's fide, fram the Ambus
:. de: On board the latter,old cale knives,
forks, nails, &c. supposed to have been
irevioufly fired from the Boston. This
last named (hip has ports for 40 guns, but
only mounts 32, those on the main deck,
English twelve#. One of them was dif
mounted and rendered useless during the
engagement, by a ball from the French
man.
'It has been said, that the last arrivals
from France make no mention of a decree
of the National Convention relative ic
goods belonging to their enemies, found on
board neutral veifels. From the C/ivo

Though nothing turned up that could ren

gate her to New-Providence.
No plea could be found for detaining

It is a surprize with many, that some of

the French do not proteel the American

Of the SANS CULOTTES, nr French
man without Breeches.
OF the Sans Culottes, we frequently
hear in the accounts with France It i
a name given to certain inhabitant's of thai
country a"d foidiers in the army, proba
bly, at firO, by way of deri'lion. It is na
tural to inquire, what is the reafoir mti
w ear 10 breeches ! is >ta matter of choice,
or of necefiitv ? That it is a matter oi
c mice, is nwt to be supposed, France is ai
old civilized country. ItÂ« court re
mar .Â« able tor all th? convenrencies, eie
fancies and luxnri sos life The poorei
fort. and r ofein the molt diftaut parts <Â»j
the tCiUiid'MT. would :iave followed the
1 lfhion of ihe richer, and those around tht
vourt, had they been able. Whence, thee
time the neceifity o' omitting this part ol
covering ? Certainly from their poverty ;
iind thiv again from the oppreHloiis unciei
Which they have long laboured.
The greater p irt or what tiiev conic
ra;fe from tber industry was extorted
from th - n to c.. rv on ambitious w <irs, tc
furni'li lumptnous tables and coOly appa
rel for the king and Ins family, the fiobtii
ty and clergy. Wiien this expensive Â«. uab
idluneiit i lopped off, aid equal liberty
extended to 11, they will ali wear bree
ches.
This fma'l must give u
some uiea of the wretched ef which (lave
r.y bri ct> upon men. In me fijieit foi
a id tbe most salutary climate, the bulk o
the people are starved 1:< order that a lev
may gratifv t' eir pride .and roll in ever'
luxury. VV th v. ;t cruel insults, too, art
they repaid? Their rulers si. ft cLpr'm
litem of ihe means, and then ridicule then
like Pharoah's taikm tilers who relufed th<
ifi aelites straw, and Itili required the ufu
ai tale of bricks.
Tlie want of breeches, however, is im
material as to the success of the revolution.
Tne Americ ns wanted (what is worst
llioes a.id stockings. They wore then:
out marching after their enemy, as the
French, lalt campaign, tore what few
breeches theyh d inpurfuing the Auftriai
<a id 1 ru liaiio. The S.i is Culottes may not
appear lo well upon a parade day, but t'-ey
arc torinidabÂ»e in the field. 1 heir buii
nefs is not (how, but reality. The bree
ches of theÂ»r enemy do not serve to It-p
the point of a bayonet, and the French fel
dom iuru then* oacks, exccpt by mte.Ui
ona.ly lhowing t eir posterior to provoke
lom&iou the heavy Grerma â¢ . I. s a com

that one Kngdlhiiian is a match for thieÂ«
F renchuieilyl b t experience will eve<
prove it lalfe. she faying in\e* ted.
and is found ngcellary to be <nÂ« ulc ted, i'
order to inspire cowards with confidence.
I venture it here o.ny ai a co je ture,
that Edmund Burkk, when he la a jr

sion of a Sans Culotte ; and fuppoli: g it tc
be meant by way of infu.c to an Eaglifh

has been raving erer lime.
So nit particular advantages of the want
of breeches might be m-iuioned, and it
might he mown, from tne examples ot the
ancient Romans, tne FI ghlaaoei , and th. j
Savages, that they are by no >..e n- a ne

[Of the Liberty Crip.]
" It is difficult to fay whence a cap came
to be the emblem of liberty We tar
trace it as fai back as the ancient Romans,
who. in the ceremony of making their
(laves free, gave them a cap. Some ligns
are natmal, some arbitrary. *1 hough the
cap may be confid, red as an arbitraly sign,
yet it leems likewise something natural.
1 o stand with the head unto ered in their
presence, is what malters require oltheii
servants ; kings expeit the bended knee or
pruftratimn ; and the pope requires his
visitors to kifd .his toe : A cap, therefore.
or a cove r ; n g f or t * e hesi', t!ie mofl
nisi Â»! part of the body, may well represent
.1 freedom from abjcft fubmifiion, and a
reltoraiion to the rights of man. It is as
though one should fay to another, who
flood before him with his hat under his
armâ >> Put on yonr hat l r." Heme ill
government the cap is an emblem of h ir*.'e
people, who have furreiu ei ed no more
of their natural rights, than is confident
wirh t!.e welfare of the whole commu

Bi't were the cap a sign merely arbitrary
it 1 no matter, wlien -.veil underlfood :

" IV 18.
" fOR some time pad I had formed a
plan of taking from the enemy a body of 7
or 8000 men whom they had pushed as
far as Rheinzabern ; but to lucceed, it
was ncceflaA- to occupy the Prufiians in
ail pans, and to deltroy their cavzlrv and
infantry, which they had at Edeltheim,
and at the didanee of a league and a half
from Landau Had I retained the com
mand of this army, 1 ftiould have deferred
the enrerprize till the commencement of
June, and tlu-n the army, better exercised,
would have been in a condition to execute
it completely ; but reflecting that I was
about to depart, and that our enemies
might advantage of their good difpo
iition to gain some success over our ad
vanced polls, which perhaps tie new ge
neral wou'd not be able to prevent, fori
want of knowing the country, in which Ik
Is to carry 011 'he war, I determined to
attempt an action.
â¢ I sent a courier to general Houchard
with orders to attack in the rear Limberg
an ' O-tfberg, with the army of the Mo
selle, whih- Pulh should keep in check, and
attack with the reft of the corps des vallies.
a Prussian corps, who had advanced ; and
while general Sulk with nine battaliors
and some cavalry should advance tow. rd 6
Anwelier to molell the Pruflians- The
fame day the garrison of Landau had orders
to occupy the banks of the canal of An
veil r, and the vineyards and village of
Nuflcuff, with fcveral other potts, and
make the Prufiians appre end they would
be attacked in the rear, in cafe they should
make any movement. I had caused are
port also to be spread in the Piuffian ar
my, that the cavalry of that and the Mo
selle had arrived, as weil as a part of the
artilliry of Strafburg. I had ordered ge
neral Ferrier, who commanded forty bat
talions, only to shew himfelf to the enemy,
until he [hould hear that tha engagement
had commenccd, and to attack then the
wood of Rhienzabern and the Auftrians
who were in it b yond the village, Not
withllanding my orders, I did not fee his
troops appear till il o'clock, at which
time gcneial Diettman had commanded a
retreat, because the troops, being fa
tigued, could neither procure provisions
nor drink. I began to march at 8 o'clock
in the evening with 26 battriions, 3 regi
ments of dragoons, 2 of chafTeurs, and 3 of
cavalry, to repair to the heights above In
fheim towards Rulfheim. I ought to have
arrived there at break of day, but the
unavoidable delays which I experienced,
prevented me from reaching that place till
5 in the morning.
" The advanced guard, under the com
mand of general Landremont, behaved in
a manner superior to all praise ; during
the engagt ment they kept back the enemy,
y.nd prevented them from quitting the
sorest of Gemerfheim. Our artillery had
a prodigious effect on the troops of the
enemy who appeared.
" The eleventh legiment of dragoons
charged, with the grea eft fucctfs, a regi
ment of Austrian huffais, who fullained
great loss Several ot the officers '.ver e
killed on the spot. While general Lan
dremont w. s thus engaging the Austrian
array, and preventing them from advan
cing, the army of the republic extended
itfelf on the heights of Rulfheim, and
proceeded as far as that village, when the
flankers came to inform me that they
observed a column of the enemy's infantry,
with c nnon, and a column of cavalry
proceeding from the wood. I ordered the
tenth regiment ofchafTeurs to march, and
dispatched general Diettman to go and
view the, force of the enemy. As I was
certain that the enemy's cavalry confided
ot only 2 divisions of dragoons, I charged
them with vigour, and they betook them
selves to flight, after sustaining considera
ble loss. mong the number of the dead
were three officers. Had it not been for
the infatuation of the battalion, who took
our cavalry for that of the enemy, this day
would have been glorious for the troops of
the Republic
" In vain did we attempt to rally them
againâthey answered only by discharges ;
and it was with great difficulty we could
â make thc-m re fume their ranks. It may,
liowever, be proper toobferve, that several
(jpippaijits of this battalion, and fosie
! others whom tliey had hunied away by
their panic, kept firm to their ports
" 1 have learned that this event was
occasioned merely by the commander, who
began to cry outâtrenthery ! tieachery !
He was arretted, and I ha'e since been
told that he deilroyed himfelf.
" This day, which ought to have been
so memorable, terminated by th: tak'-ng
of one piece of cannon, and a very great
nnmber ot prisoners. The loss of the
enemy mull have been considerable, it we
may judge from the ravage made by our
cannon. Our loss does not exceed J2O
men, and is only in cavalry.
" 1 (hall not set out for the army of t'ie
north till the end of three days. Ism
afflicted with dreadful fits of the cholic,
which oblige me (till to remain.
" I mull be candid enough to inform
| you, that the command of the two armies,
"hat of ihe Rhine, and that of the Mo
fel'.e, which you have entrulled to genera)
Houchard, is superior to his strength.
" General Diettman, on whom I had
cad my eyes, and whose modelly is equal
to his talents, finds also that the military
duties of a general are superior to his : â
But this I do not believe.
" I have already solicited the rank of
general of a division for general Landre
montâand I agau renew it.
(Signed) " CU3TINE."
[From the South-Carolina STATE
GAZETTE)
IN the State Gazette of the I 7th instant
I have read the biographical (ketches of
ioine of the leading men at present at the
head of affairs in France, extracted from
an Edinburgh paper.
The characters of MetTrs. Roberfpierre,
Pethion, Dariton, and Marat, in tliefe
(ketches, are trade particularly the fub
jeft of illiberal animadversion.
Not only againll tliefe individuals, but
againll the members of that august a'fem
bly, ihe National Convention of France,
the moll malicious calumnies, and malevo
lent inlinuations have, in a variety of pub
ications, and from a variety of quarters,
been difTeminated. To damn the reputa
tion of its members, to depict them to the
l world in an odious point of view, feemi to
jbe the objefl of such publications. Could
this be effeiied, it would be an important
point gained. It would bring discredit tc
the cause, of which they are the supporters,
and in proportion to the reduction of its
influence on the minds of men, would the
monarchical and ariftocratical interests bt
benefitted.
Had a policy of this kind been confin'i!
to those regioivs only where despotism is
tftablifhed, where tie will of the fove.
ieign, and not the vox populi, is the fu
preme law, it would not have been a fub
jeÂ£l of wonder, but surely it mud becomt
so, when in a fiee republic, the legitimatt
representatives of a great and enlightened
people, are fligmatized and spoken of in
terms of opprobrium and disrespect. When
occasions are fought to hold up, as a base
and imlamous band, the legislators and ru
lers of a magnanimous and generous na
tion : When a word, an cxprefiion, of one
of its members (and that word, perhaps
erroneously or maiicioufly translated) is
catched at for the moll mischievous pur
poses, and the theme of public declamation!
" Tell it not in Gath, pubiifh it not in
the streets of Alkelon."
I don't mean, meflrs- Printers,to under
take the defcnce of the moral characters of
either Mr. Roberfpierre, Mr. Danton,
Marat, or Pethion ; nor to advocate the
atheiflical theoiies of Mr. Dupont, so ably
combated by a learned divine, though
not so much with a view of serving the
caule of religion, as to fix an odium on the
supporters of liberty in Fiance ; but not
withflanding what has been said of thefc
king killers,prieft killers Atheifls, See. See.
charity leads me to believe that there are
at leafl as many virtuous, honell and good
men among the members who compose the
French convention, as are to be found in
the like number, colledted together in the
fame manner, in any country, or nation
whatever, with the superiority on the fide
of the French, of a much greater propor
tion of patriots, and friends to the liber
ties of the human race.
Where dodtrines immutable in their na
ture, relating to matters of government
and the rights of man, are promulgated,
they naturally become the objedt of serious
alarm to tyrants ; and as I (hall presently
(hew, it is no new thing for the satellites
of despotism to endeavour to throw an odi-
um on tenets an J principles which ilify
have no argument to controvert, by hold
ing lip to the world their propagators, as
A-retches of the molt contemptible c.ft,
ind unworthy of the notice orattention of
nankind. A# oht likenpfs begets another,
l ey wit}) to establish this inference, thai
10 doctrine can be morally good, which
< as for its p omulgarors or supporters men
tiorally bad. 1 his seems to be the specious
nit fallacious reasoning of the advocates
or expiring despotism. Hence it is, that
lefpatring of iuccefs ;n the field of argu
nent, to refute eternal truths, these chani
jions of monarchy seize every occasion to
tamp with in amy, the characters of those
vho are advocates for the righis of man.
Hence it is, th t the celebrated author o(
he work diltinguifred by that appellation,
has been lo often traduced in the English
piints and as the (light ti mark of indig
nity, been burnt in cfngy, in that boalted
and of liberty, for the propagation ot his
principles, by the common hangman. And
from the fame insidious motives, 011 the
defeat of general Gate?, near Camden
were the following exprefiions insultingly
made life ofagainit the American congrels
n a congratulatory address to earl Corn
ivallis, fubferibed by " divers loyal inha
bitants of Charleston."
"We connot but consider the late at
tempt of Congress to fuhjugate the free
ncn of this province t*o their tyrannical
lowination, as an additional proof ot their
"efllefs ambition, and of the wicked ma
chinations of the contemptible remains o(
hat expiring faÂ£tion who have so rect nt
y exercised a despotic and lawlcfs sway
jver us."
Here, Mtfirs. Printers, the reprefenta
ives of the American nation in oae ind f
:riminate mass, were accused by the abet,
lors of liritifb tyranny,in this very city of
Charleston, of the bale design of ftibjuga
ling the people, and of bringing them
under their, (the Congtefs's) tyrannical
' ruination. Are not the convention
charged with the fame crime? Tlu-y are
iccufed ot priffi-ffing, what the Frencli
ire said to pofTcfs, a "reltlefs ambition"
ind wicked intentions. They ;ire cJ ed a
fadlion, and a contemptible one too. The
ame thing is said of our allies. And
'hey are charged with having adtually ck
:rcifed despotic and lawlels sway.
Were these declarations founded in
truth, I would fuppo'e that the mem
bers of the Ajnericao Congrtfe, at that
time, were as r fcallv a set of fellows as
the members of the National convention
ire said to be. But hajepy for America,
that though forne bad men have ctept into
her councils, a fuflicinnt majority of
them (as the event has proved beyond
contradidion) were worthy of the conli
dence and high trufl the r country re
posed in them. And happy it is for
America that if (he has produced an Ar
nold, the is not without her Washington.

When he was near an Hundred Years of Age
Willi a recommendation bv the Hon. Joseph
Addison, (Author of the Spectator)
I n the followi.ig Words :
" was or an infirm canftitution
till about forty,, when by steadily perill
ing m the course of life recommended in this lic-
Je book, he recovered a perfect state of health,
insomuch' that at fourfcore he published this
work. He lived to give a third and fourth edi
tion of it ; and having palled his hundredth
year, died without pain or agony, like one who
falls aflecp. The treatise 1 mention has been
tefcen notice of by several eminent authors, and ia
written with such a spirit of cheerfulnefs, religion*
and good sense, as are the natural concomitants
of temperance and f bwety. The mixture of
the old man in it, is rather a recommendation
than a difcreuit to it."
