j ,*eat adv mtage from chem. believe, u<f
i ty funpofe, tn Â»t they are lpegking only
t . t tnat.es, who have rej cited every feitti

t â¢Â» piece* vviili the lights ot good fen fe a -
)( te ; let irs examine Vn few words, what
ri 4lly inigat have been the wiil of the re
p ibiic.
It is fnperfluou" here to invefligate the
p.biic or private rights of nations, to learn
chat the French people, in ivneu/ing thfi
fu ia! compatl, had no ot er ' iglit over the
d Ferent part* of the aft* >ciation. than that,
v iich was g ve4 to them, by their new a
g dement. They ha % 0 themselves fel
b Â»uÂ»i<U to all lawful authority in their tie
c irat on of the rights of men in foaefy.
N'j nation, however powerful, has more
r ;hC to an unlimited authority, than an
individual ; and it can no more act tyran
n cally with impunity. Thi tyranny would
b To much the more dreadful in that, like
t > the hundred headed hydra, it would not
e/en leave a hooe of its extm&ion, with
tie fall of the tyrant's head. But the
Trench republic, which corre&ec! the firfl
declaration of the r ignis of men, only to ex
plain the sacred principles in a Hricter feufe,
did then acknowledge, that her power anc
will could not, legally, be further extend
ed.
What now is the confeqtience ? either
that the French republic ought to ndmil
t le coionifts under the fame guaranty oi
persons and property, prom fed and gnar
s ityed to ail the members of the new a (lo
cation; or â¢ that it had no right to d f
p >fe of their property without their con
font, and without previously making their
a fatisfattory indemnity or, in fine, il
h id no ether power, than that ofexclu
dng them from tiie new allbciatiou. A
more powerful consequence, which we
0 nght to ascribe to these principles, is, thai
their violation, in refpe& of the Frencl
V/eft-Indies, has no less broken all the re
ciprocal rights and duties of the firit alio
ciatio 1 , k under which they took their rife,
than tli* fame abuses and outrages, 011 th<
fi.le of England, towards the United State:
of North Ai erica, has juffcly effected thei;
1 {dependency. Thus, that ridiculous ac
c ifation, so often, and so profufely throw 1
< it against the unfortunate''French colo
l ilts, with the view of robb-ng them will
i npunity, is only an additional outrage tc
ail the others of their oppreflors ; anc
I ley would have been julkiti.ible in pro
claiming their indcpendency, if they had
liail the power of effecting it. We do no
fear then, nor scruple to aflerr, that if fuel
fce the will of the republic, 4 to give liberty
to our (laves, as has been afierted by thofn
p.efum'mg delegates, it exercises only tn<
r;ghc of robbers, I mean that of force." Ii

of the French republic and its delegates
that more than an hundred thousand fanii

JT must afford lingular fatisfaftion to the
1 friends of freedom, to contemplate the
havoc, which, Since the American revolu
tion, been made amonglt those nume
rous cuftoiu: and prejudices which fwayeel
the sceptre over our aristocratic and op
piciieei ancestors. It is, however, an equal
cause of regret, that so many opinions,
tifages, and laws, Still exiSt in enir country
which can be j unified only by the circnm
fcrihed reasonings of a Burke, and which,
if they are fuffered to remain unhandled]
may gather increasing Strength', and ulti
mately open the Unices for an inlet of poli
tical lierelies, that may inundate our coun
try, and involve our citizens in ruin.
111 a republican government, it is the in
terest and duty of each individual to paf<
ftriftures upon any proceedings which he
may deem inconsistent with the public
weal, as well as to propose filch measure;
as he may think conducive to the general
Welfare.
Convinced of the truth of the preceding
observations, any attempts to combat prin
ciples which may sow the feeds of arifto
cracv, but more particularly endeavours
to display the alluring, but venomous rep
tile that affords nutriment to monarchy,
limit be confielered as laudable in them-
and worthy the attention of the

Still entitled to the equal right of being in
dulged in the defence ot a contrary princi

are the laws of the land, it is of the highell
importance that those opinions, which em

citizens in general ;* What objeit could
"lore advance this purpose, than the public
difcnflion ofqueltions, in whole detritions

i am fenlible that controrerfies of this
nature, havefoinetinies been attended with
no benfrficial effects, and. when neld out
to the public through tlie medium of a
'ew(paper, have, by a refufal of publica
tion, been timely {topped in a career which
would have no better tendency than tc
involve the parties in <ii(grace : this ha;
been, when personal resentment gets the
oetter of a zeal lor the public good. To;;
candid mind, however, this can be no dil
paragement to the principles which r ad
vocate. So long only, as arguments art
conducted *\ nil cool deliberation, difpaf
lionate reafoiiing, and republican modera
tion, are they worthy the attention of tlie
citizens. For my own parr, whenever;'
writer deviates from his profefled subject
>nd launches forth into 3 licencious (trail
of malevolence, personal calumny, an<
abuse, I immediately accede to the opi
iiion, that he either lacks ability to defend
or if convinced of the injufl ice of the cauft
lie ati: mpted to espouse. But when well
intentioned periixns (tep forward and vin
dicate opinions, however contrary If) thâ 
vulgar prejudice they may be, they are (til
entitled to a (hare ol' the candour am!
clteemof their fellow citizens, and any in
fringement ofthe exercise of fueh a light
lliould be considered as a direct attack upot
the liberties ofthe people.
Hut, while on the one hand the freedotr
of speech and opinion ihould be defended
nn the other, we fhauld guard against re
lapsing into licentioufuefs. This, by til;
friends to mankind, is what i. equally ti
be abhorred with a degeneiacy into ai ilto
cracy. Wlic-n the lives and properties o
ihe inhabitants are subject to the tyranni
of a licentious mob, their fury is more t<
be dreaded than the discriminate vengeann
of an eastern monarch.
it is however natural, tint a people
who have experienced ail the horrors ol
defputifm, Ihould, upon a Hidden clianpt
111 their situation, be so fafcinated vvitl
the new and plealing objects that are pre
lented to their view, as to (tide into the

cd bv fume, whether it is not abfolutclj
necefiary for the preservation of the com
munity. When the people at large have
faded of the sweets, nay, the lieentioufnd:
of liberty, no consideration will force-their
to forfake its cause, till it is leaned on i
jafis fufficiently permanent. When, ii
times of exigency, the populace have af

These reflections have ari/en, chiefiv.
from a conlideratioii of the comparative
inference between the revolutions of A
merica and France-. After conliderabh
â¢eflection, I am led to believe, that tile
telebraud work of Jonathan Swift, enti
tled the " '1 ale of a Tub," might, in ma
ty rel'petts, serve for nearly as good at
allegorical delcription of these two memo
table incidents of the present age, as foi
the diflention from poperty for which ii
was intended â
Martin, a deliberating, felf-co-rceitc
fop, and naturally attached to pageantry,
when anathematized by Peter, who hat
excluded him from the privilege of drink
ng wine, after having rid himfelf of hi
m other's tyranny, proceeds with flow ane
tautious steps to dived himfelf of thoff
trappings which had heea added to hn
daul coat. His timid spirit forces liim tc
jroceed with such caution, that when he
tompletes his bufmefs there Hill reinair
mnierou! fripperies, fineries, and infignic
3f fuperioritv. of which he is afraid to de
prive his veftnient, left it lliould spoil it;
ippearance.
Jack, on the contrary, of a quick and
"urious temper, enraged at the insults am
>pprellion which he had experienced, refo
utely determines, without a moment 1 -
lelay, to rid himfelf of every veltige o(
lis former gaudinefs. Here flies' one
thing, there another, as his pafiion directs
aim, till at length, tearing with violence
the lace from his coat, he rave the gar
ment likewise a conliderable rent.â
The refolute,determined, and impetu
ous tteps which the French have taken to
thvelt theaifelves of every remnant of arif
cocracy, may perhaps have impelled them
to make a temporary trespass on the other
lide of reason, yet they are fufficient to in
sure them fiiccefs in the cause in which
they are engaged ; and, when peace Dial I
have crowned the martial toils of the citi
zens with victory, they will have fufiicient
leisure to mend the seam which they may
have ripped asunder.
To America, it (till remains ro lay aside
* "In every political dilquilition that
comes before the public (fays Mr. Erfldne)
it is 110 matter whether tile parties that
handle the subject reason right or wrsng
it is fnfficient that they do reajon, and
Truth Iprings from the collision."
iiiany of I' oft which, so di
"cerning minds, serve as ail enfign"-of ot:r
former degradation. At some future )>e
rioelit rniij have beep in vainior sis to h.-vt
lopped off the branches', for, while tbe

though perhaps inleufibly, iiicreale, till it
.it length spread iorth into the 7:njv
oak of royalty', under whose knoLty bought
we have (o recently reclined.
Numerous are the opinions cf those
who pry into the arcana of politics, refpec! -
ing the exiflence of tyranny. Vaiious art
tie eanirs to which they attribute its floti
riflfmg fimation. L ncertain as we may be
nsto itsbriprt, by recurrence to teftimdin
and experience, eftablithed by the univer
lal hill ory of every age and nation In whicl
it has prevailed, I think, we may by thi:
lime discriminate the fotirce of its continu

advantage which has been taken by ii;t
artful and designing in the times of igno
rance and barbarity, over the fuperflinou:
and credulous minds of those imc-nligtyen
ed foil: of antiquity. Prone by nature tc
believe in a sovereign arhiter of the uni

breads, that it feenis to iiave penetratei
aor very nature. The decisive tellimonj
Â»f faÂ£ls corroborates my afi'ertibn, and
provided we juefge dellitute of prejudice
we must pronounce every fyficm ol fan a
ti ciftn, which has prevailed in the world
to < ontain sentiments which countenance
tiAirpation. Theforceof prejudice, aid

by reason in a more uncivilized f ..te o
mankind. Universal cufloni foot) acquire:
the more atigidl form of a leco dary prin

in ascendency over the thoughts and ac

dible, were it not for the iiumerons in
taj ice's that might be adduced to prove it.
The aid which time affords to the belief oi
1 Itory, is too weli -:- i,-a <o need any ob

herefore, much cause of admiration, that

in attempt of that nature, but I cannot
forbear hinting at the political tendency oi

Happy would it have been for mankind
f, oil the formation of authoritative tenets

lion, can, without any flrain to his princi

in a republican government, appears to fnc
an inexplicable paradox. Let enquiry be
made ot the reason e>f the oppohtioii to tiie
eaufe of freedom ill France. Alk the
counte'r-revoiutionilis why they will Hot
fnbmit to the authority of the National
Convention ? The answer is ready, an(
every one is acquainted with it. I would
not with to iniinuate, (as perhaps some
would afl'ert) that I desire all religion to be
fvvept from the earth : i conceive it tei have
been agood political engine, and, perhaps,
may have been a barrier to the coinniiffioii
of crimes: it is that species of fniaiieifm
and bigotry which 1 condemn, that prompt:
one individual to molelt the tranqui ity eil
hiÂ» neighbour, and unnecrfTarily t Q
the pursuits Â«Â»f his happiness. A*elil>olit;or
of this nature, I am foi ry to obierve, pret

" Â° 'did era t ion of this may per haps be the fub
je6l of another efiav. I conciuele at pie
fent by remarking, that a democratic spirit
is entirely incon/jjat'rble with religions fa
naticiim and bigotry. The prevalence oi
one is a ftite ieflimony of the absence ol
the other. If the former should be the
balis of our government, the latter should
be entirety eradicated, as being the foun
dation upon which almost every anti

seem at the present moment, contending
for the sovereignty of the Union. The

but unlets we are vigilant, the latter may

time is near at hand in whil

as a plenipotentiary, from a free sik
virtuous people, eflure us of the triumph:
of the cause oflinmanity, and the future
hsppinefs of eur mo;her country. Oil
citizen ! it i* at tllia dear name that oin
hearts are roused, especially when we re
fltft on the masy evils which she has fuf
fered for ages pall, from a government nf
childish craft and ignorance, flriving to
er.fiave a nation whose literary fame ha>
ever diftingufhed it from the reft of
morta's.
In this land of Liberty you are surroun
ded with'hole sages, heroes, and repre
fenta ives of a free and magnanimous peo
pie, who Â£i ft imbibed facretJ pretensions
to the.rigi)ts of man ; those who destroyed
the infernal blind folds which hid the
chsrtm of truth , this is the people whe
demunftrated to France, to the universe
the pofiibility of obtaining themâthi:
Iniill be, then, a people of genius ; the)
reciprocally imparted to each other politi
cal knowledge and patriotic views, ir
spile of infernal fo'ges, and an abfoluti
power, which was frightened at phan
toiiis by a theory which seemed to Dt
the emanation of the divinity.
Receive, Citizen, the sincere vows w'nicl
we makeyou for that fuccelsin arm ; whicl
the people of France ough' to be crown
ed with in their vigorous efforts. Having
become citizens of Ameiica we refjr fl
its laws; but the prtfent cause being tht
cause of delpots against freemen, we can
not forefee with tranquility and indiifer
euce, thai if the republic of France fhoulc
be crushed by this unprecedented coaliti
on of tyrants, we also should be threaten
ed with the fame fate. The cause is com
mon to us, but we fubrait to the decilion*
of our Â»ife legislatures, whether we oughi
to remain ina&ive, or awake around thoft
| colours to which your nation lent a propi

rants.
The joy which the people of this vafi
country have w tneffed to you, are the
n>ofl certain figne of their gratitude, ancj
as to us, citizen, it confirms us in the po
fitive opinion, that you will be prosper
ous in that important embassy that tht
people of France have confided to you,
which we all sincerely hope will be crown

By order of the French Republicar
Citizens of the city of New York.

REPLY.
New-York, Aug. 9, 1793. 2d year
of the French Republic.
Citizens,
BORN Frenchmen, the love of liberty
drew you to America ; this, day, in
this double capacity, you come to manifefl
your vows and your affe&ions for your
mother country, now bccome that of
freemen.
1 he p-op'e of France have, for a lrn<Â»
tiaie, ardently wished to be one family
with the people of America ; kindred
sentiments have imperceptibly drawn them
towards each other ; this is well known,
and in spite of all those obstacles which
some have thrown in the way, thev are
convinced, that these two people are made
to love, to tdteem, and to be united to
each other.
Frenchmen, look upon that epoch as
great and happy in which the people ot
i wo free countries can give to the world the
f'.iblime example, of two rations mixing
their interells and their affectionsâthen
will be commenced the mod; glorious revo
lution that ever honored mankindâ'hen
hatred of people to people, fomented by
tyranny ; wars which have strewed the
gh>be wiih blood ; and the (hackes of
commerce, which discourage industry and
retard the progress of the social vi. tues,
i-.-ill difappear| and ail the human fp'cies
breathing, after a long m scry, will employ
themfjves on the fubjeft of their individu
al and joint happineis, in the bosom of
Peace, Abundance, and Liberty.
Citizens, the tribute of gratitude and
jffettion which you pay your country,
ioes you honor, and is natural ; those who
had the happiness to be born in France,
ivill never forge' their native countiy
Tliefe particular evidences of your cf
teem are, to me, flattering encouragements;
the only recomoence which I hop: if, to
obtain that of my fellow citizens ; having
such a repolrory for my confidence, I (hail
be able to support their rights with un
moveable firmnefs nor will any obstacle
ever abate my constancy or my zeal.
(Signed) GENET.
