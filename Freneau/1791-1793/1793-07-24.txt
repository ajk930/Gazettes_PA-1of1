Two topics were particularly prefl'ed. the
one, tnat the motive of enquiry did not

Mr. Jefferfon was the scourge of all oppo

tne Jnftigator of theinquirv from its incep

â with malicious infinuition- against the cha

formation.
sth. Thit applauding an officer for con
cealed deviations from the 1 bvious injunc
tions of the LAW, is subversive of the Jane
lity of its obligations, and inculcates a dan
gerous difaffeclion from the constitution
'.by consenting to a radical revolution in the
government, which in theory, is made â <
government of LAWS, bun by practice
rendered a government of MEN.
6th. That the idea of pecuniary profit 01
loss to the public, is contemptible, whei
put into competition with the found obli
gation of LAW.âThat the officer wlu
disregards this obligation, fubvertsthe con
figured tribunal of decifio .1, and usurps il
legitimate authorityâThat Inch uftirpa
tion contains in itfelf the eflence of cri
niinality.

From the view of the fubjeÂ£t, which thef
papers have presented to my mi. d, 1 ha\t
come to the following conclusions :
1 ft. That the enquiry into the offici 1
ondtift of the Secreiar> of the Treafuri
was casual and no; premeditated, aid ot
eoi rte could not have o iginated in a mo
ve of systematic pt rfecunon.
2d. That Mr. Jefferfon ct uld not have

ing obviously commenced ill the ufuai
cotirfe of debate, and in his ablence.
3d. "1 hat the enquiry commc-nsed upon
tlie firft occafTon which was offered during
the fe3ion, and that this occalioii was not
fotiTli! for, b'tt was offered by the uniform
lupporters of traafury influence.
4th. That in the whole progress of the
bilj v.':iich gave rife to the enquiry, a j J
p?cioui precipitation, isobvioufly difcovei

jth. That Cortgrefs were debating in

" The Prefiden.'s late Proclamat.oll ha
put this country, no doubt undefignedly
nn his part, in ail ignominious as well as
dangerous situation. It cannot be denied
that the Britilh are r.ow seizing indifcri
minately every American veilel rhey can
find with French property on b-ard, and,
in the European sea-, prov lion vefl'els de
flintd for the ports of France: that they
will condemn the property the-y so find, is
certain; that they w 'II condemn maiy <r
the veilels too, there can be very little
doubt. What if this Proclamation is found
Jo he their only juftilkatiah"? Can tli-.r.
be then a moment's doubt in thePrefident'
mind that it should be recalled. When
we find the name of the lirft roagiftrate of
our country to the reservation of a fpeci.il

surprized ; and the work is difrefpecUd
becaufo the drift of it iÂ« difcerrted."

[Of the French jacobrrs. ]
The Jacobins of Paris have been the fub
jeftdfmuch ignorant abuse. The (imple
fact and history is this : Early in the pro
/refs of the French revolution, a number
if patriotic societies were formed at dif
ferent places and under different appellati
ons, todifcufs the pontics of the day, and
propagate the principles of general liberty
One oi these societies, called the Friend - of
the constitution, becoming numerous, rent
ed a part of the old convent of the Jaco
bins, at Paris, for the purpose of their
meetings. The difcuflions that took place
there, and the occalional publication: ifllied
from thence, attracted the public attention
Co strongly, and co-incided so well with
the sentiments of the people, that the con
ffitutional society at the Jacobins soon be
came the largest and most important of the
patriotic societies of France ; and similar
corresponding meetings, under the fame
appellation of Friends to the Conliilutio'i.
w ere formed ill most of the principal towns
of the kingdom. The Jacobins, therefore
(as they are called from the places of meet
ing of the Parilian society) confifl of a
large part of the French people, a decisive
proof of their merit, and a full reply to the
calumnies of their enemies. Mr. Fd
nuind Burke has been pleased to call their
traitors and regicides. 111 the comxnoi:
acceptation of those w'ords the aflertion
cannot be true. The society of the Jaco
bins exercise no public function : they are
not officers of shite, legislative, executive,
or judicial; they have no public trust im
poled on them, and they do nothing but
debate political subjects, and now and then
direct the publication of a political dif
conrfe. As individuals, they ,\re like the
component parrs of all other htimhnfoci
(.ties, good, and bad, and indifferent; but
if the good did not greatly preponderate,
they never would have experienced the
support of their fellow citizens, as they
have done ; nor would they have become
the objects of hatred and dread, to the des
potic governments of their European
neighbours."

By the Sally, Captain Egger, from Cap.
Francois, which file left the 4 [ h of July, we
learn, that at that time about one fourth of
the town remained (tandirg, but entirely
:le(Vrted by the white inhabitants, \\ ho hao
fled in every direction, to avoid the melan
h ily scene. A few negroes remained,
who were employed in burying the dead.
The Conimiffioners Santhonax and Polve
el remained nt Aude du Cap. a small dif
cance from the town, attended by the niu
attoes. negroes and other adherents. The
rotrniiffidners had ifl'ued orders to one ot
the mulatto generals to oifarm all the
whites, as it was supposed peace could not

Extratt of a letter from New-York, dated
Friday morning, July 19.
"News of this day is, that a privateer
winch failed from Boston for Cape Fran
cois to get a French commiflion, on her
way thither took an English (liip, which
was retaken and with the privateer carri
ed into Halifax by a Britifn cruiser, and
the privateer's crew hanged."
Ancient Apologue, ;ot inapplicable to cir
cum/lances of the prejent period:
Once upon a time the il.eep entered into
alliance with the dogs, for their protection
again!! the wolves. The consequence was,
that the fhecp remained in fafety;âThe
wolves de-filled from their attacks and all
was peace.
After a time the U'olves found means to
persuade the flieep that the dogs were a
useless burden and a needless expence. The
dogs w ere difmifil-d and the wolves fel,
npoH the flieep and devoured them.
