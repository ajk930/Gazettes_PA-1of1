[Numb. 8 of Vol. ll.]
From the American Daily Advertijer.
TN my la" I urged it as a fnfFicien;
JL reason why the public fuffrage (hould
be withheld from Mr. Adams, at the en
suing election for the office of Vice Pre
lident, that he was the known and avow
ed friend to a government of king, lords &
commons and had, since the adoption ol
the present one, endeavoured by his
writings to inculcate this pernicious doc
trine upon the ainds of his countrymen,
thereby impairing the foundation on which
it tells. And altho' I cannot suppose
that any person acquainted with his wri
tings, will undertake to -indicate him a
gainst this high chatge, yet it neither
iuits the importance r.or the propriety ol
the enquiry, that any doubt on the fab
jeft should, at the present moment, arrest
the public mind, His defence of the
American constitution's, and discourses
upon Davila, the documents referred to,
tho* forfome time pail in print, may not
have been generally perused. To place,
therefore, the merits of t; is charge upon
their true ground, I shall now fnrnifri
irom those publications, such brief ex
trails, as will, I presume, fufficier.tly dc
monftrate it 3 truth.
In Vol. i, âpage 3, of the preface we
find the following palTage : " Without
three orders, and an effectual balance be
tween them, in every American conllitu
fion, it fflift be destined to frequent tin i-
Voidable revolutions ; if thiyaie dtlayea
a few year;, they mujl ccrne in time.â
The United States are large and popu
lous in compnrifou of the Greci
an commonwealths, or even the Swif
Centons; and sre growing evefy day
more disproportionate, and therefore lef;
capable of being held together by limt.lv:
governments Countries that encreafe in
population so rapidly as the itates o!
America did, even during such an impc
venll.ing and deftrudlive war as the lad
was, are not to be bound together by
silken threads ; lion?, young or old, will
not be bound by cobwebs. It would b;
letter for America, it is nevertheless
agre d, to ring all the changes with tlit
whole set of bells, and go through ail the
revolutions of the Grecian states rather
than eftab'ifh an absolute mmarth
among them, no- withstanding all the great
and real improvements made in that kind
of government."
Again, page. 22. "If Cicero anc
Taciuscould revisit the earth, and learr
that the Englifli nation had reduced th;
great idea to practice, and brought ii
nearly to pe feftion, by giving each divisi
on a power to defend itfelf by a negative:
they had found it the rr.oitfoh'd ft duiablt
government, as -well as the mojl free."
Again, page 25. "What is the ingre
dient which in England has prefevved tf:t
democratical authority ? The balance
and that only"
In page 1 16. " The sources of inequa
lity, which are common to every people,
and can never be altered by any, becaufs
they are founded in the conllitution of na
ture : this natural aristocracy among man
kind has been dilated on, becaute it i:
a fa& efiential to be conlidered ifr the in
ftitution of a government. It is a bod>
of men which contains the greatest collec
tion of virtues and abilities in a free go
vernment : is the bti ( ;htell ornament and
glory of the nation ; and may always bt
made the greatest blessing of society, ii
it be judiciously managed in the conlli
tution."
And in the next page, " There is bui
one expedient yet discovered to avail tb<
society of all the benefits from this bod}
of men, which they are capable of afford
ing, and at the fame time to prevent them
from undermining or invading the pub
| lie liberty, and that is to throw them ali
â¢ r at leUt the mod remarkable of them,
into one assembly together in the legil

FOREIGN ADVICES
London, Sept. 21 â  The only port in Chi -
na, to which the India company's ships are
permitted to trade, is Canton,in nearly tilt
souther imoft part of China. It is wel
known that tee tea. their great article ci
commerce, grows chiefly in the northern
and mountainous parts of that vast em
pire : so that the India company, beside;
tile adulterations the tea may fufer on the
way, are fnbjcct to the advanced price
which mull naturally arise from carrying
an article some thousand miles, from that
part of the country Where it grows, tc
Canton, where it is (hipped for England.
And, added to this, our woolen Iti inn pic
tures, which are in high repute, and chiefly
adapted for the northern parts of Cluna,
by being obliged to be landed at Canton,
are fubjecied to the damage and expence
of an aftonithing length of inland carriage,
so as almost on' many articles, to amount
to a prohibition. The intent of Lord Ma
cartney's emb iffy is, it pollible, to obtain
permiliion from the 1 niperor for our {hips
to trade directly to some port in the north
ern parts of the empire, where the tea can
be had on the spot where it grows, and
where our woolen would
find a ready market from m llions of peo
ple,
Lord Macartney is further direÂ£ted, if
pollible, to obt iiii leave to mike a settle

we may eftabl :â Â» a factory for the con pa

Extract of a letter from Bvjlon, dated Nov- 13-
'â¢ It is-oblervable that ail high-flyingfe
dvraiiils are mightily for a fhsatre in this
town, which is as vehemently bppofed by
the moderate men, and if I am not very
wrong in my opinion will be ultimately
dilaountenanaed by the legiflafure. It
has always been the policy of arlllocracy
to encourage public lhews, and such like
fol.ies, to divert the people's minds from
politics and government aiiairs ; and rhis
is one great cailfe of a Theatre being, op
posed here By God's help, we nope to
continue ftedfaft in watching all public
proceedings, notwithstanding the tempta
tion.' to turn alide, and will not be led a
fvray by the songs of Syrens. To make the
pill go down the better, plays have been
introduced among us under the fpeeious
title of Moral leÃures ; " thereby infringing
upon the duties of the clergy, and, as far
as can be done, fubitituting the play-house
for the church, and collecting from giddy
and deluded people the reward due to the
latter It was not without reaCtm. that
our reverend friend -lately exclaim
ed (upon hearing of their crotlded hou

morality, and could never a 1 that time
make more than a scanty living by my la
bours, andherearea set ot fellows whoc n
pick up hundreds of dollars in an evening
from â¢â¢ moral lectures, 1 ' that in realuy
have no more morality in them than my

moral lecturers, is. to ofter beuefit-nignts
for the poor, and for the children of the
clergy; thinking thereby to get the law re
pealed against theatrical entertainments.
Whatever they may think, few people

The following is the inb'tance of remarks
made by Mr. Balcjwin in the House ol
Representatives, on Tuesday Nov. 20,
on the subject of referring to the Secre
tary of the Treasury to report a plan
" for redeeming so much of the public
debt as by law the government has a right
to redeem."
" THIS mode of calling for plans from
â¢_,*r.e heads of departments, he feared, would
Toad further than the hou'fe would with to
go. It was too common, he said, when a
certain rtb' eai was to be attained, to avoic
a defeat, which a direct attack mi. ~.ii pro
duce, and wind round", in order to make its
attainment more certain, by gradual ap
proaches. By one motion, made on doubt
ful ground, supported by arguments apply-
Ing to.lt: particular nature, keeping out
of view the doubtful nature of its tenden
cy, one step, by the success of this firft mo
tion. is made over the true line ; âanother

precedent, and a further encroachment is
âtill, when it becomes evident,
1 , flu !igradual encroachments, th it dan
gerous ground is reached; âbut then, to
excuse a further trespassâprecedents in
numerable, the general nature of which
i before xept out of fight) now become a
Strong argument against receding. _
Gentlemen wilhed light and informa
tion, it was alio hi-: wi!h to obtain it from
every proper source. It had been made
the duty of the executive departments to
!v r information to the legislature but this
information f.iould relate merely, in his
opinion, to ftateinents of facts and details
:,j buiineis, âthe with tne m
:'e.rmario:i acquired, Should frame the lav.'.
He wilhed it explicitly and finally deter
mined. how f.:r l.ve Initiative ouliaeU
li euld be solely by the legisla
ture. u: d how much niijht l>e referred to
executive departments. He conceived
there was a folid'diaerencc of opinion, on
this point, in the house. as well as out of
doors. Some conceived, that the more af
lairsof society were thrown into the hands
of individuals, the greater Was tne fecu
::;y error. Others, on the other
l and, were of opinion, that clashing in
tercfts in large bodies kept them more
free from partial and improper bias.
Such a latitude was given to the expref
fi.ons in the law eftabidhing the treafuiy
department as to give room (he did not
mean tc criminate that department'for the
intrcdui-'ion of new fvltems and taws not
expected by the legislature.
When a motion for referring to the Se
cretary of the Treuibry the-petition of the
public . red.tors was made to report a pkm,
but little idea was entertained, he said,
that ftsch a law as the funding would be
the result, or that the excise fy'tcm would
have been the cordequeilce. ,
The impoh fyfteni was framed in a very
diaerenc manner, he remarked : âfirft prin
ciples were adverted toâinformation was
collected from all parts with great labour.
Had the treafuiy department been eStab
iilhed then, this information might nave
been procured withlefs trouble : but this
once ca'l acted, the legiliaturc made use or
it, a d framed a law, the formation 01
which has not been looked upon as bad.
He then -dwelt on the diflinction oe
tween receiving information 011 which to
form a law. and receiving a pian of tne
law ready formed. He Warmly opposed
L'i* c > ijicdc c! ? receiving information, us it
was called from the Secretary. Gentle
: ten had said, that we might reject what
was proposed ; cut there was a great en
tire ue between a legislative power and a
revifionary power;âa very great differ
ence. as contemplated in the constitution
a difference bet'v. ten originating and pof
(eliuig, only the right ; 1 a negative.
The houle had'as much power, he re
marked, over theprocediugs of the Senate,
as over the plan of a law rep rted by the
Secretary. There is but this difference
bet ween them, that the plans or the Secre
tary are well fupprrtctl by argument.
He Slated the difficulty of mending a de
fective part in a corny!*'. at :d (y item, with
out indangering the uniformity of the
whole. It was less difficult to put toge
ther the parts from collected materials,
and to amend a plan before matured.
His objections to calling for matured
plans from the heads of departments had
arown stronger Since he firft entertained
them.' He held a; a principal niaxim in
governments, that the legislative, judicial
and executive powers Should be as dillinct
as pcfib'e. The propriety of this diftinc
rion was founded, in his opinion, in good
sense. It was-dangerous to entrnfl those
who had a profptct" of deriving sortie ad
vantage in the execution of a law to have
any hmd in framing it. It was as impro
per for the executive to meddle in the bu
inef4 of legislation, as for the legislature
to Utend to the execution of laws.
His high sense, he said, of the importance
of keeping the executive and legislative se
parate had had great weight on his mind
in objecting the other day, to bring an ex
t'cutive officer to an! ver m
the house. Such a precedent, he feared,
might pro re a dangerous one and lead to
an interference tif the legislature in more
important points. . . .
He owned that in some instances the dif
ferent departments of government mull
neceiTar*ly, rtj fame degree, be blended ;
but, he iniifted, they ihouldbeke.pt tepa
rate as much as polfible. Gentlemen, on
another occasion intimated, that the barri
er between them was chiely theoretical,
was a paper barrier. If it was a neeef
fary barrier, he hoped it would be as ef
fectual as U it wis a mound.
F.xperience was ilrocgiy hi favor, he
said, of the principles he 'I ne
house had tried both modes of originating
law?. That fvftem, which was originated
in the house, in,the sense in which he un
derllood the expreSlion, had set well on the
feelings 6f tlie people. Their inteieus,
nvi."re rere'ea.ted, their fears and
'.ov< understood by those who originated it.
This was not the cafe, as other laws had
been origlwted j on; person, licwovi
great his information and abilities, could
not be expected tc. be : ,ri, .anted with th
interefts of every pare of rt> exteniive a
country. If this mode had net been a
dopted in originating the excil? law, and
the other pursued, lie thought it might
have been rendered move consonant to the
feelings of the people.
His conftituenti, he contend;'!, had a
right to hive their feelings represent
ed, and if he found it impracticable
to nuke chsir voi.es heard, and fen
timeflt understood with effect in the htmfe.
he ihould confjder it his duty to try ano
tli *r mode of forwarding their intereit;
He would go, he said, to where fyltem
!>! ijjiiiated, there he would thrult in u!) it
i lfurntationan aequainnarice with his co:i
iiituents put him in poffHiion of, and de
mand it as a right that their feelings Ihould
be consulted. 1
Information he knew, and he fuppoed
it would be mentioned is received from
riiffererit quarters at the treasury, by pri
vate letters and, private conversations.
These often conveyed falfe information,
to his knowledge, and persons w}to ' ,at '
given it from the quarter from which he
came would not readily have owned it a
mong their neighbors, who might coniider
that their legal reprefsntatives were tne
aitly true sources from which information,
loncerning their wants or deiires, ihould
be derived."
To the Editor of tbi rf i lON AL 1 Fii-
S i R,
THE ful leers now under consideration
of the committee of Congress in regard to
the late expedition, are of too much im
portance to the citizens at large, and to
the honor of the United States, to require
apology fv a frÂ« mail's requesting
von to oabii'h the incioft-d queries relating
thereto. Matters of this nature ought not
jo" he ftnotiiered, but full invelligatien
made without favor, affection, or malice.
No information or hint.., for th.N pu.rpaie,
Ihou'.d be rejected, ir.tnely becacfe theyare
anonymous, and more especially when they
relate to fa.'ts placed within the power of
the committee" to investigate. A commit
tee might reject an anonymous paper hand
Â»d in to them w hen they would be induced
to refoett it if cow-eyed through the pub
lit eye for freemen will fcruthnze the con
duct of their fen tint.;, when iacls ai e laid
jefore them.
I am, fir, your humble servant,
J. S.
XâT is ftfp'efitfully requeued of the Ccm-
mittee of Congress on the late weitern
expedition, to fatisfy themselves find the
Public (now they have an opportunity of
information) reflecting the foliewi. g par
ticular:, viz. _ . ,
Fir It. Did the Commander in Clnet
cultivate a good underltanding with the
second in command, and with the other
principal officers ? or did he not ? It is ge
nerally aliened that he did not.
Second. The Commander in Chief in
his letter from Fort- Washington, Nov. 9,
informed the Secretary at War, that he
was, or supposed himfelf to be, oil St. Ma
ry's river, about fifteen miles from the
Miami village, when he was defeated. It
ii now aflerted that he was three or four
.imes that diitance ; far too much weft
ware! from his object, and on the waters of
Wabach'e. It is vvifhed to have this cir
:u initar.ee cleared up, tor the committee
rave not noticed it in their report^
Third. It appears from the Coraman
ierin Chief's letters, that at this place,
'Xuppofed to be fifteen miles from the Mi
ihii towns) he had retolved to throw
flight work in which to deposit the men's
knapsacks, S.c. and to have moved on as
lightly accoutreed as pdffible, those tiiteen
miles, in order to attack the towri.
011 the presumption that the army was
i.e, sc, or 60 nine;, iniiead of 15, from the
Miami town", it is allied what would have
been the consequences had tl.e enemy per
mitted his Excellency to have marched
that 15 miles, lightly accoutred as he pro
poled, or even twice the diiiante ?
Fourth. Did the Commander in Chief
ever call a council of officers lor their ad
rice in this respect, or in regard to any
transaction whatsoever on tlie campaign .
11 is aflerted he did not.
Fifth. The committee, in their report,
State, that in their opinion, the Comman
der in Chief was not at liberty to let tne
army move on without him, or to this ef
fect, notwithstanding his extreme infirmi
ties, and that ( with extreme pair/ to hhu
felf) he was carried 011 a litter: It is aik
ed what can excuse such an order to the
Commander in Chief ? Would it be im
proper to make this order from the War-
Office public j for it appears to be one
great cause of the defeat ?
Sixth. It has been afl'erted that the
Commander in Chief knew that there
were no provihons on the road betwee:
Fort Washington and his encampment, ai
the time he detached the firft regiment. anc
weakened his army thereby, m a mod: ei
fential manner : It is afl*erte<d- that he hat
official information to this effect from Col
Hodgden, the quarter-mafter-gtneralâ
for it seems that all the flour e> pefled
did arrive with Capt. Kenham. at the en
campment cf the army, oii-the very day.
and. at the very hour Major HamtramtX
marched the firft regiment off. These
matters, are too important not to. be mi
nutely endnbed into,' after tlif3 hifb'fna
tlon j and ittdre efpecfally $S thÂ£ cofelnit
tee of Congress have slated hi their report
that u the lit.,,,regime.:* detached jo
cover A convoy of provisions expected to
arrive."' , ,
It "is find that Cel. Hodgdon. Major
Thomas Butler, Major Gaither, and many
others can fatisfy the committee ori thel'c
heads. . â¢ i
It hi.3 been aflerte.i by every
officer ?rrcoriverfatien with tÃefr fellow
citizens, \vh.eo. ashed, and it is said it has
been given in testimony s o the committee,
that the Commander in Chief had neither
; econnoitered around the ground l:e or
dered the army to encamp upon v. lu re the
defeat happened, either before or alter
encamping there :
Did he or did he not so reconnoitre ? T
Eighth. It is aflerted that thefecond in
command, remdnftrated to the Comman
der in Chief again)! the rout he was pur-,
linns; and declared to him that he would
lose, or lead the army into the Leather
wood Swamp?, on the Wabafh liver, far
weft ward of h?s true rout to the Miamh
town; and yet the Commander in Chiri
perfirted : Have the committee any fuclt
information ? â¢ ...
Ninth- It is aflerted that Genera?
Harmar marched his army in October and
November 1790 front Fort Washington tc

-A ly managed bv women a.id boys ;
the men generally living nothing more tc

clayed, French, ar,<i Spanish fugan.
The fait springs which have been foam
n the fi'i le state of Kentucky, tinner pr 6
per management, would be lufficient t(
produce fait for all the inhabitants whicl
the wcllern country could support. Then
are at lea ft twelve of those springs betweer
Great Sandy and Cumberland ; the prin
cipa: of which are the upper and low,"
blue licks, on Licking creek ; r.e on tin
Great Bone crtek ; one on Drimnon'
lick Creek, about a mile and a half frori

poverty than ignorance. The great prifi
eiplr by which the saline particles an
ch-yll:i iz d, s univerlaily known to be b)
the evaporation of the humid; and tht
gren er the fuperficia' furface of that eva
poration, the more rapidly the chryftali
will form. But the fir It settlers could noi
procute fait pan -, and wer*; obliged to uf<
a 9 a iubliiture the pots and k.ttles whicl:
they had brought out for dcmeftic purpo
ses.
Such was the commencement <-f ma
king fait in this country; which, fr ill it:
scarcity and high price, in some measure
discouraged the settlement of the coun
try. However, the gn at improvements
since tiiat tera have done away all those
fesrÂ»y and flt is now manufactured xi
plenty, and fold tolerably cheao.
The water i 3 t-y no means so strong as
sea water. It requires nearly four hun
dred gallons-to make one bushel of fait,
which is more by one half than would be
wanted of sea water to produce that quan
tit .
The water is not colle&ed immediate
ly from the spring. An area of from five
to ten acres round those springs is found
to be impregnated with this mineral, fc
that by digging wells in any part of that
space fait water is discovered. F onl this
citcumllance I afn of opinion, that by dig
ging pits a body of earth w< uld b. founc!
ilrOngly impregnates with fait, from which
the saline pa ticks might I e more eafilj
separated thn from water; and it isi cer
tain, that it the water receives its par i
chs of fait, from the earth which it passer'
th. ough, such earth null contain a large
proportion of fait, otherwise the ftrengt
cfthe water would not be so considerable.
However, it will require some time to do
ten ire this matter, as the infancy of oui
ecunt y wil not permit us to speculate toe
largely in experiments which would be at
tei ded with heavy expences, were they
not to prove fuccefsful.
Salt springs have be n found in every
part of'.he wcllern country which has
been well explored; and I have no do >bt
that time will prove t hat evety part of it
is well fuppbed wthth em The manner
by which they are mostly found in unit,
habited places is_ by the large buffalo roads
which lead to them. Wheneter the ra
mification of those roadÂ§ begins t con
centre, it is almolt an infalli !c iign I at a
fait lick is near Those animals refeSrting
to them throughout the temperate part oi
the year for the benefit of the sal , makt
large roads, which leading frcm the lick,
branch different ways into the country.
We have various other minerals, such
as iron (which is the moll ufeful) copper,
lead, sulphur, m;re, &c. &c. iron ore
is found in great plenty upon the nor'herr
branches of Licking reek, and likewise
upon the waters of the Great Kanhaway
There is another between the Cumberland
â  I and Tenafee rivers which is said to be very
valuable, and its ore is more pure than any
other which has been difcovercd in Ame
rica. But the lead mine on the Mifiilip

fever?,l others some of which lie on the
Spanish fide of the Miflifippi, and have

3 have been discovered in several pi ces, but
- the mine on the Wabafh is, peihaps, the
' richest vein of native copper in the bow
â¢ els of the whole earth ; and no doubt will
1 fender all the others of little or no value,
Sulphur is found in several places in abun

" which is collected from eaves and other

---' ty on the waters of Grten river hari ii
: is in any other part of Kentucky ; bul
1 perhaps (till farther southward it will be
â¢ found in greater plenty. However,' it ii
> so common in every part of the country
! that it might be made i confide' srble at
ticle of tjtportation; I have heard of tfi<
' black lead mines upon the head qua ten
of the Kentucky, but I have not been a
, ble to procure any certain information re
â  fpeding them. But I should conceive
1 that these can be little doubt that, whei
1 the country, and particularly the mountainous
â  tainous p its of it, are well exp'orcd, al
the ufeful minerals will be found in a
bundance.
I have already mentioned the coa
mines in the upper parts of th? Ohic
country ; btfidesr which there are greal
quantities of coal upon the upper bran
ches ol the Mifliiippi. It is particularly
favorable that this mineral lies at thi
heads ot our larger r vers, ffs it can b<
sent down with the great.-ft facility ; anc
it is very certain that the great body ot ii
which tiie Ohio country alone contains, i:
equal to anl'wer all the purposes for w : id
it may be wanted throughout this ex;enfiv<
empire.
I hough the champaign part of thi:
country has fio stone on its furface, ye
every where limefton'e is found from fix tc
fifteen feet below it. Molt of the bottom
of o.ir rivulets and ftrcrfms are paved witl
this stone. ft is' very easily calcinecf
when it becomes excellent lime. It is all;
convenient for building, by reason of it:
peculiar fmocthn.fs, and the ease witl
which it may be worked into any form
Besides this stone, which is th mof
common, every other kind of stone i
found wh eh is l'ther ufeful or orriamen
tal, such as flint, grindstone, and millstone:
of a very go< d quality, which have beei
reckoned equal to French burrs. Ther
is the great;!! plenty of marble upon thi
banks ot the Kentucky, particularly a
Letlburg. I have not seen any which ha:
been poliflied ; but judges in that bufinef
gi*e us the most fluttering ideas of it:
qualit^.
Cla\ is very common in every part o
this country which is proper for bricks
and there is a superior kind on the Beecl
fork i f Salt river, which no doubt miyh:
be manufactured i to good porce Sin â
Carver has mentioned a clay o; this fori
which lie saw sb ve St. Anthony's falls
Marie, chink, and ochre;, ar<
found in various parts.
Mr Jefferfon h s described the midici
naf, iuflammable, bituminous, and othei
Ipfings, very accurately; and as there
have been no discoveries or light throwr
upon the fubjed since he wrote, I shall re
ler you to his book for a particular account
of them. Indeed, his account of the na
tural history of t is country is generally
to be depended upon, so that it is scarce
ly pofhble to make any improvement upon
it, until farther discoveries shall have an
fen ; I therefore confine niyfelf to such
objects as he has not taken notice cf, and
to luch as haÂ»e prefentcd themselves since
he wrote, occasionally making some stric
tures and animadverfior.s upon his opi
mons and information.
I have observed that the climate of
this country is various. But, as climate
is frequently different in the fame para!.
lels of 1. titude, I will endeavour to o-ive
you forte idea of the difference between
the climate on the upper parts of the O
hio, Peniifylvania, and Maryland, of Ken
tucky and Virginia, and of Cuniberianc
and North-Carolina, which lie in nearly
the fame parallels one with another.
It is well known that the climate upon
he Atlantic coarf: of America is in the
extreme of heat and cold, and that it is
more va iable tnan when it was firfl: fet
tled by Europtans; but the winters are
milder. The extremes pioceed no doubt
from the immerife continent, which lies
to the northwefl, and which is inter
f erfed with frefli water lak.es. The ra
rified air of the torrid zone rufhin in
currents through the upper regions to the
Av&ic circle, leaves a vacancy for the
cold air, which; in supplying its place,
causes those frequent chills or v<tria ion;
â n the spring and autumn, and alternate
froft, rain; aod n ild weather in winter
which are so common in the middle part:
as that country The cold is more ilea
3y to the north of Hudson's river; bul
the power of the fun to thefcuih of 41
Ty countera&ing the influence of the
northern winds, occasions those fudder
changes rom he;.c to cold. Opening the
:ountry has greatly tended already to lef
ien the cold, f>y con'fequence of the greate;
:)(-iwer of the fun upon the earth ; and ;
general cultivation, by producing a warm
er atmosphere, through which the nortl
wind passes, mult tend to moderate the
dima.c generally on the Atlantic sea.
