â¢' I fincereVy rejoice at the acceptance
of oar new Conltitutioii by nine dates. It
s a good caHvafs on which some strokes
only want retouching. What these are, I
think are fufficiently martifefteJ by the
general voice from north to fotith, which
calls for a hill of rights. It seems pretty
gener lly underllood tliat this (houM e.o
to juries, habeas corpus, (landing armies,
printing, relgion, and monopolies. I
conceive there nay he difficulty, in find ng
genetal modifications of these, suited to
the habits of all the states 15 it if fucti
cannot be found, then it is better to eftal)
hfh trials hy jury, the righ of h beaa cor

religion, in all cases, and to aholifh Hand

proper ; but i ( this exception cannot be
agreed to, the remedy will be, t > mode'
the jury by giving the medietas linguas i'i

- the habeas corpus in infurredtions and
rebellion ! The parties who may be ar
rfcfted, may he charged instantly with a
well defined rime : of course the judge
will remand them ; if trie public fafety re
quires tha' the government should have ;i

land, fee how few cases of lie. fufoenfi ai
of the habeas corpus law have betn wor
thv of that fufpenlion They have been
either real trenfons, wherein the parties
niglu as well have been c iarged at once,
ur Ih nil plots where it was (baneful they
should ever have been susp Â£te<l. Yet for
the few cases, wherein the fufpenlion of
the habeas covplis has done real good,
that operation is now become habitual,
and the minds of the natioa alnoft pro
pared to lire under its coaftant fufpenlion.
A declaration tint the federal govern
ment w:l ! never rtftniin the p efles from
printing any hing they pieafe, will not
takeaway the liability of the printers for
falle facte printed The dec! iration that
religious faith (hall be unpuniftied, does
hot giro irr.pupity to iviminal sets dictated
by religious error. The faying- there fhnll
be no monopolies, less-sis the incitements
to ingenuity, which is spurred on by the
hope of a mou ply for a limited time, as
of fourteen y ars : but the benefit, t'ven
of limited 's, is'oo doubtful to
be ojipufed <0 tint of t,heir general fufpen
lion. If no check can be found to keep
the number of Handing troops within f fe
bounds, whi e they are tolerated as far as
neci fia:y, abandon ihtin alt. gel her'; di
friplinc well the militia, and guard the
magazine with them. M re tli.in maga
line guards will be us less if few , and dan
gerous if many No European nation can
cvir fetid agairifl us such a regular army
is we need fear, and it iÂ« hard if our mill
tin are not equal to those of Canada and
Florida. My idea then is, that though
proper exceptions to these general rules are
desirable, and probably practicable, yet if
the exceptions cannot be agreed on, the
eftahli rncnt of the rules in all caf s w ll
do ill in very few I hope therefore a
bill of right s will he formed to guard the
people aga nft the fed ral government, as
t ey are already guarded againfl their (late
governments in moll inflances. The aban
doning the principle of neceffarv rotation
inihefcnate has, I fee, bÂ«ei\difapproved
by many ; in the cafe of the prefiden by
none 1 readily therefore suppose Spy
opinion wrong when opposed b ; the ma
jority, as in thefotmer inllance, and the
totality in the latter. In this, however,
1 ihoulu have done it with more complete
fatiÂ»faÂ£ti in, had we all judged from the
Cime pofiiicn "
_ " Paris, Nov. I 8 1788.
" As to the bill of lights however 1 It.jfl
think it should be added, and I am glad to
fee that three (tat s have- at length consi
dered the perpetual re-eligibility of the
preftdentj as an article which should be

The limited powers of the federal , overn-

mode a'e, and ripai able. The inconveni
c icies of the w int of a declarati n, ar

t 'ley arc in a constant pio.'iefiion from bai

For the National Gazette.
Mr. Freneau,
You will please to insert the following ex
n aÂ£l from a Pamphlet now pubhlliinc; in
Virginia, on the nereffitiei of <,n A
mendment of the Conflitution of that
State, tranfmttted for publication in the
National Gaze'te, one of yur sub-
Iciibirs in Rich i ond, in coufvquence
of a violent attack lately mad. on the
Secretary of State, in Mr Fenno's cele
brated ve/j ce, cflahlifhed fur the con
veyance of such little tajfages of arifto. v
eratical (lander upon foine of the wor
th iefl-characters in .A merica.
' "J T would be improp r, no doubt, to
|_ drag into public view any indivi
dual, on account of anonymous publican
tintra. But these may affilf to fliew, the
d Hgeious (late of the political atmof
phcre. wuhin the ten milts square. Ever
(nice s he commencement of the pr< sent
government of America, the whol of the
executive departments have been kept in
conUaut ferment by those lit 1; paper
feuds. On the oar fide, abufet, forconli
leringthegovcmm: n- afreetepubi an fyf*
tem, under wl.i.h aÂ» citizens they hav? aand as servants tiiey are bound, to ]
condemn whatever in their opinions, may I
appear wrong. The other, comr/Sended I
and ex oiled, for conli.lering it only as
one llep towards that abject (Ute of court- <
ly dcceit, which should render all -it* de- i
pendents base, in order to create a flind I
offecret, fafe and fnng free-matonryanion'g ;
th~ brethren erf the court. Whether any I
of these publications, are indebted to the
hand, as well as to the conduct of these
officers, for thar exi Itence, would perhaps
be improper to premise. 'It is fnfficier.t
to obft'rve, that any one less interelled, or
less capable than themselves, could scarce-
Iv have written feelingly as some of their
authots have certainly done.
As to the enmity or friendfhip of any
of these officers to the present general go
vernment of America, it is not so much the
business of this particular part of the pre - j
lent nndertaking to enquire, as it appears to
Tiave been the o jest of some of t<.ofe pub
lications to shew. It is tO' be prefiuned,
that every one is a friend to the govern
ment under which he holds an el-vated
pod, until something more, than merco >-
jctlions to the Â»d ninidration of it, is made
appear. Indeed, when we fee a man in
that htuation, acling thus, it only serves
to prove that something inud be really
wrong in public mt?alures, as well as that
ha has an uncommon (h;:re of virtue him
f.lf. But wh .n We (ee cthsrs, in aJimi/'ar
Situation, perverting the principles of the
government under which th-y act, by im
poling on it, things* unconllitutional and
bad, and thereby exciting general sdium
difgtid, we cannot but conclude, that they
themselves will prove the real enemies to
that government in the end. This then,
U the only proper dillinÂ£lion to be drawn,
between the different executive depart
ments, on the score of enmity and friend
fliip to the government under which they
aÂ«sl.
With lefpedl to aridocratical and re
publican principles, we have no difficulty
in determining where to look for them
Whether any of the publications above al
luded to, may be reckoned arrnng either
of those speculations on paper, for which
one of those great departments of govern
ment is so ienowned ; or whether either
of the officers of those departments, is an
enemy or a friend to the present govern
nicnt of Am-rlc: 1 3s H
nrtt so much the business of this digression
to enquire, as what will be the probable
i:7ue of a loose indefinite display of liber
ty, in the governments of the different
dates.
Having (hewn the tree which has al
ready produced the real fruits of enmity
to the government under whose influence
tiiey have grown, it will not be difficult to
trace the route through which the princi
ples of monarchy and aridocracy are to aid
i,i bringing it 3 deftrii&ion about By an
indifferent and loose attention to our inte
reds in the llates, we acquire naturally the
lub t of inattention to our intereds in
American affairs. The fame carelessness
;.iid indifference to our interests whi h will
, . duce a weak and indifferent legiflatuie
:n a date, will beget a trifling and incom
petent representation theie From this
cause rrviy already have arisen, perhaps,
i be (hameful praiSiice of referring so much
ciie business of the general leg'flature,
the different departments of the cxecu
branch, into whose dangerous vortex
â¢ .ay be whirled in time, all the important
â¢ .'.errftg of the people of America.
The governments of the dates, which
v .re formed in the hour of necessity and
inxperience, when the human paffi>ns
â¢ i'. e; e in their highed region of resentment,
; rain It the government of Great Britain,
,-,d have never lince been corredled, may
I- considered therefore, as the (lubborn
t ">is of those evils, among which Hands
. u main sprout of knowledge (on the high
. , fertile ground) to which
: : fad recourse i 3 often had, Every
aber, who from weakness or wrong
:'plee, can be induced to tulle of this
â idden fruit, may be considered as ano
. dangerous old woman, in the great
â  i !en of our political affairs. Whether
>c weak, or whether he be base, will
natter of but little consequence to
i after he is sent. The little slate
.t, or political Satan of aritlocraey,
i r. always ready and ingenious enough
i , to make tie bell of a::y opening
i.. t may offer, to produce the fall ol
i. , .-from his primitive llate of republican
* Funding systems, excift laz's t exslujive
' â¢ - os> & c ' &(-f or
perfection, knows but too well, on which
iide to look, for the frailties of human na- 1
ture.
It is to a good and fubflantial fydem
of po icy in the Hates only, then,' we can ,
resort for security in our congressional as- ,
fairs. The general government, excellent !
as it isiniifelf cannot produce complete 1
happiness without the alfiltance of the go !
vernments of the dates. Governments
formed on right principles in the different
dates. would certainly be the mod natural
means of introducing proper priuc;ples in
to the government of the continent. The
habit of acting in the right w3y at home,
will always' produce a p/oper conduct in
men when they go abroad. Thus the
Hates, accustomed to a proper mode of
governing themselves, will naturally give a
proper lone to the government of the
whole By (hewing a proper regard tor
the rights of-reprcfentation ourfclves, we
should convince t'nofe, who were to govern
there, that they would not go unnoticed in
sporting with the people's rights at lary;e.
In a country like this, whfre a d:tfe
rer.ee "f climate, a variety of foils, and a
j gffat difference in natural advantages,
| pto hlce all the diversities of interests that j
I can exill, no general fydem of taxation can
I pofiibjy be equal and just. One an import
in.; Hate ; another a manufacturing one ;
the third an exporting one ; a fourth
too new, too local, or perhaps too poor
to be either ; a part poffeiTid of (laves ;
another p- rt made up of tradesmen, fHher
men, and mariners; some interspersed with
a variety of glorious navigable wateis ; and
others environed with impenetrable ir.oun
tainp, wil.iernedes, and inhospitable tribes;
such a complication, in short, of Situations,
ilimates, intcrclls and the like, as renders
it impofiible that any geneial tax, which
t uds to throw the collection on the fame
article throughout,fhould he either politic,
nam alorjull ; and could only have been
thought of from the want of confidence
in the governments of the different llates
Indeed we know, that the want of confi
dence in the states, in the collection of
their quotas of the general revenue, was
among the principal causes for establishing
the general government itfelf There is
no doubt then, that the establishment of
proper (lite fyltems how, would immedi
ately throw the reflux of revenue back, to
f !;ofe in which " â¢Â» so natural it
(hould flow.
It is a mortify ingt hi pg, to both i he repre
feniativeandthereprefented, no doubt, that
the important charge,with which the one is
intruded by the other, should be transfer
red and bartered off to a third, for a part
nership in his knowledge, on little more than
half-flocks to the community at large.
Nothing but the want of confidence in
some other body, than the Secretary of the
Treasury, could ever have introduced the
Humiliating practice of referring the great
and important bufmefs of taxation to one,
who to save himfelf the trouble, might
make another transfer, if he chose, of this
tranferrable property in the people, to any
little f (lock jobber, who was able to
wield this great weapon of dellrudlion, to
deprive them of their ftnall remnant of
interell in themselves. Governments in
the llates, with whom could be intruded
the important business of determining the
mode of colleiling the taxes, would of
course, be a mod important objett, on a
general view of our intereds in American
affairs. A confidence there, would not
only dedroy the influence of tkofe, who
calculate the downfal of republicanism,
through the medium of finance, but would
dlfo quiet the a'arms of t ohers, who aid
thelt willies, by being too much accullom -
ed to view the cause of liberty, through
some of ourprefent imperfect plans of go
vernment, on the dangerous fides of licen
tioufnefs and dedru&ion."

less acceptable because it treats the people
like rational being?, altho' it wants rile Sanc

r Clain, Andrew Gregg, Moses M'Clain, Ro
bert Whitehill, John W. Kittera, Da iiel
' Heifler, Jonathan B. Smith, Peter Muh
lenberg. Charles Thornton, William ScÂ«tt.
The frauier.s of this ticket (continue tliey)
have btfeii guided by the following mo
tives;
In the firft place tfiuV have carefully a- j <
voided all Cincinnati knight errant?. Be- |
caut'e they conceive all who,let themselves
tip tor chieftaiiis. especially military chiefs,
are very unfnitable characters to represent
the citizens of a republic, whole distin
guishing pallion (houlcl be an ardent love of
liberty; and without equality, liberty can
not exist a moment. But every order of
patricians, knighthood, or nobility, are ab
foiutely incompatible with equality, and
therefore deftru&ive of liberty. For these
reasons the national afl'embly of France have
exterminated every veltige and emblem of
such dangerous combinations from their
country, and shall we who profefs to be
republicans, be less zealous for the preser
vation of our liberties, tliau the citizens of
a monarchy?
Can those who are pleased with such
childidi toys as the effigy of a ravenous bird,
suspended to their button hole by a bit of
blue ribbon, as a mark of diltinction from
the rel't of their fellow citizens, be fuppo
fe_d to have fouls fufficiently exalted to re
present freemen? Mr. Paine, describing a
ristocracy, fays, " It talks about its tine blue
ribbon, like a girl, and shews its new gar
ter, like a child." Put eagle for garter, and
behold the very image of our Cincinnati.
The state has tritfted its bulinefs long e
nongh to these kind of gentry ; it is time
no>.v it (hould 'â¢ put away chiidifh things."
Secondly, They have avoided as far as
they knew, all Bankers and Speculators in
the public funds, because it is their interest
to iucreafe the burthens of the people,
which we think are fufficiently heavy al
ready. Every Ami they vote, they pocket
a conliderable portion of it themselves :
This is regulating for themselves at the i
public expence '. They are both the layers {
and receivers of taxes. From this source j
has arose grievous abuses. Hitherto the !
bulinefs of Congress has been to contrive !
pretences for taxation. We would wish j
persons of principle and capacity frnt to the i
next Congress to dcrelope the fyflem a lit- j
tie, and. if poflible, (top its progress, for we j
cannot expect this from its authors and j
admirers. The funding system. the Indian j
war, the excise law, with many other j
things, are ftibjects that need revilion ; if |
they are fufrered to go on in their present
(late, their evils will accumulate.
Thirdly, They have endeavoured to fe
left characters, whose habiDs, sentiments
and (ituation. plate them on a footing with
the great mass of the people. Men who in ge
neral poifefs '* neither poverty nor riches,
but enjoy food convenient Men whose
pcrfonal interests are blended with the in
ter efts of the people they represent: Men
who are pretty well known to possess found
ui)derftanding,3iid judgments well inform
ed with praÂ£tical knowledge, fufficient for
every purpose of legislation, although some
of them perhaps are not connoisseurs in li
nance and stock-jobbing ; yet they are mod:
of them men of plain, honest, rural repub
lican manners, who will not afl'ent to any
ipeafure without a fufficient reason to fa
tisfy their conscience. Such persons are
molt likely to attend to the public bulinefs,
and not diflipate their time in riot and plea
sure at the public expence, while the pub
lic bulinefs is facrificing in a secretary's of
fice. Hitherto money bills, and indeed e
very other kind of bill of consequence have
originated with the secretary of the trea
furyy, a man tainted, we are informed,
with monarchical principles. This perhaps i
accounts for the analogy between our po- ;
litical tranfa&ions, and that of Britain's.â
We think Congress have held long feflions,
and decreed themselves fufficient pay to
have enabled them to do all their bulinefs
themselves.
Fourthly, They have endeavoured to
divide the members as equally as poflible
throughout the state, so that the greatest
poflible information refpe&ing its circum
stances and interest may be combined in its
reprefen'racion. This is. a prime maxim in
reprel'entative government, and ought to
have been the principal objefl of the legif
lattire in framing the ele&ion laws ; as
they have neglected it, it devolves on the
virtue of the citizens. They mult careful
ly attend to it; they ought also to inform
themselves who voted for the law as it now
ltands, and exclude them from their confi
dence forever.
If those who vote for this ticket are go
verned by the fame motives with its form
ers, they will not consult what is calied the
monied interest, the commercial interest,
the ariftocratlcal interest, the landed inter
est, not- any separate interest whatever ; the
public interest alone will be the polar ftai
by which they will steer their conduct. If
any characters in the ticket are contrary to
what the framers have fnppofed and sta
ted, they will rejoice to have it decefled.
: They have no personal attachment, are up
der no pcrfanal obligation, nor have they
, any personal expectation to gratify ; to pro
. mote the public good is their sole induce
ment, and would be happy to be corrected
by any public spirited perl'on, who they
, hope will always aliign a reason for what
. he advances; every amendment that will
give it public confidence is solicited. They
[ have laid nothing of electors for president
and vice-prelideiit. The firft theyprefume
will be continued in its present occupant,
j who will probably hold for life. The last
they apprehend is of little consequence who
' hvids it'; his bulinefs is only to be ciiairuiaw
of the senate, with aa enormous faliry,
which renders the office in a great measure
a linecure ; as the chairman does 110 more
business than the otlier members, all this
extra pay is given for nothing. Indeed it,
matters little to the public who presides iu
the fcnate ; They do not choose to let the
public know auv thing about the reasons o{
their political conduct: the public therefore
may trouble theiufelves little about (hem,
excepc it be to watch them with a Uriel
jealousy, and try to get rid of them as foo
as polfible ; it is but little good ever they
did, and but little good they can do ; but
they may do much evil; there are howe
ver valuable characters (hut up in their di
van, We (incerely with them released. â
Pennsylvania wanted a senator this lalt ses
sion ; we pray a greater evil may never be
fal her.
FOREIGN AFFAIRS.
PARIS, August 4.
Letter from Mr. Arthur Dillon to the National
AJfembly, dated Augvjl 2.
" Desertion encreafes among the Auftri
ans, for their soldiers are unwilling to fight
for the emigrants at a dillance from their
own country.
" At this moment, there is a violent fer
ment at Mom and Tournay. None of thfr
soldiers belonging to the camp are permit
ed to enter the city; and all the magazines
have been evacuated. I have an opportu
nity of judging, from what I fee, that the
enemy have very little confidence, as they
throw up very extensive entrenchments a\
small ports. '
| "To defend two polls of 30 men, they
j have formed abbatis of trees for half a
; league ; but this did not prevent Lieutenant
i Colonel Richardot from forcing his way
! part these two ports, sword in hand. An
1 ardour for combating, and the love of good
j order and subordination, encreafes every
j day in our army. Could we have a rein
jforcement of men,and a frelh 1 upply of
j mnlkets. there would not remain the fmall
i eft doubt of our success.
j " The enemy are carrying on a war which
will not gain them friends. They com
mitted great atrocities at Bavay and Or
chies."
M, Dillon's letter was accompanied with
a (ho/t account of the atrocities committed
by tlie Auftrians at Bavay and Orchies, by
which it appeared that they levied oppref
(ive contributions from the inhabitants,
bt at them unmercifully when they would
not labour as they required, and carried off
their public treasures, even after they h;id
promised, in the nahie of the Emperor, that
they would molest neither the persons nor
property of individuals. At Orchies they
aflaifinated seven citizens and several wo
men. They loft 400 men in the firft attack.
A French officer of the name of Baflet, a
Lieutenant of artillery, discharged a can
non sixty four times in left than a~ quarter
of an hour. After the garrison of Bavay
had retired, a hundred volunteers, who did
not know of their retreat, kept back the Au
ftrians for some time, and retired in good
order, after expending all their ammunition.
When the enemy got pofi'eifion of the
town, they indulged in every species of li
ceiltioufuefs â¢- a Hulan blew out the braiHs
of a citize.i while drinking his health, ano
ther-Hulan plunged his sword into the bel
ly of a woman big with child, after he had
thrown her down. He was, however, pu
nished for his barbarity by a French foidier,
who instantly laid him dead by the fide of
his victim- After the Auftrians Had made
thenifelves mailers of the place, two raw
recruits, who had left their knapsacks at
the inn where they were quartered, return
ed to search for it. The Alfembiy Trailed
at the naivette of the two recruits, but they
were much atfefted when they learned that
these poor fellows were murdered by Hu
lan?.
Aug. 6. A deputation from tlie feftion of
Mauconfeil came to decfai e to the Aflftnbly
"that the king had loft their confidence â
that they rejected him with horrorâthat
they conlidered him as a traitorâand that
they abjured the oath of fidelity which the
confidence they had in him had induced
them to take," They added, that a great
number of citizens, who breathed the fame
wishes, requelled to be allowed to defile
â¢ through the hall. This petition was re
, ferred to a committee ; the twenty peti
tioners present were admitted, but the re
â¢ quell of the others was refufed.
M. Amelotfent a letter to the Aflembly
informing them, that aflignats to the a
mount of fix millions had been burnt yes
terday, making with those formerly de
stroyed, 596 millions.

Gen. Meadows, the mod active of the
generals in the Englilh East India compa

Tippoo Saib, endeavoured to take away his
own life, upon the failure of apartizan at
tempt of some troops under his command,
in a nocturnal expedition. One piftol-loatl
of slugs which he discharged into his own
body are said to have been extracted, and
the general pronounced out of danger. A
uother account fays, that " the near pros
pect of a difadvantagedus peace with Tip
poo, after an immense expellee to the com
pany, was the real motive of the general's
attempting his own life. 'â¢ Neither would
peace have been made fofoon upon any ac
count, had not the fidelity of the Indian
allies been strongly fnfpe&ed ; and that ei
ther the exclusive pillage of Senngapatam,
or a total defeftioh from the further prose
cution of the war, was the only altei na
tive they meant to offer, in cafe that was
refuted them."

" I'lli s ekiy will give us a prognostic of

the king will be dethroned. A mail it apt

my anxiety on a measure which, perhaps,
determines the fate of France, 1 am of opi

It is mentioned in a letter from the west
ward, that governor Blount has returned
to Knoxville. having had no success in his
negotiations with any of the Indian tribes
except the Chickefaws. The Cherokees
continue their murders and depredations
on the Cumberland settlement ; toprevent
which a much a polliblc, governor Blount
has lately ordered a proportion of the mi

Accounts from the Miami towns {late
the numb r of host le Indians, at piefent

Blue Jacket, oolhewa, and Snak'e are their

One cannot help admiring at the strange
inconsistency of some men, who at the very

communicating their sentiments to the pub

inconsiderate as to recommend an abr dge
ment of that privilege 111 others. Can fucli
really ftippofe that the objects of the late
war are forgotten ; or do they persuade
themselves, that the stale fneakmg cry of
the government being in danger is to relt rain the
freedom of diicutiing its measures? A wri

Brujf'ls. July t2.-Â»-Since the French have re
pofliUcd their old encampments, and have adopt- i
ed iheii formidable plan of defence, nothing ot a
very important nature has pafli d between our
troops and theirs. Frequent Iki 1 mifhes are all
that happen, which every day bccome mora
bloody item the increaling animosity of both'
parties. On the Bth a large body of Uhlcns ia
pursuing some French Pattols to Queivrain,
were attacked byafquadron of cavalry. The
engagement was desperate and bloody, but the
Auflrians were obliged to retire, with a very con
(iderable loss, btÂ»fi<ies losing a number of pri

Atanjuez, July 3. âWe have nothing new

that civil liberty is upon a better footing than

join the league of armed powers âM. d'Aranda
may ptrrfue his fyflem ot moderation with the
less interruption, as the management of foreign
affairs is eutrufled wholl, to hiscaie, and he ts
at 1 beity to ast towaid France to the belt of
his judgment for the mutual good of the two na
tions. In conformity to this plan, tho
french are now admitted to a (hare in the ne
gro (lave trade to Cuba, Porto Rico, and Aiaens.
It it probable however that the want of negroes
more than regard to the French, has occalioned,
the opening of this trade.
Irankfjrt, July 5.-This day et 1 P.M.
Francis the firft, King of Pungary, was pro
clamed Kmperor, under the title of Francis the
second. &c.
BrvJJ'ls, July 19 âThe French have at length
so far studied their own true intetcfts as to te-
Ari6t their plans in future to the guarding of
their own country, and aftingthe Best of hor
nets to whoever attacks them. This was ori
ginally Marshal Rochambeau's fyftcm ; and it
would have been better for the Frcnch if they
had adhered to it, and not ralhly declared war
against the house of Austria.
Leyden, July 25.â1t has been an observati
on, by no means ill founded, that the French
when attacked on their own ground, know well
how to defend themfclves 10 the belt advantage.
This was amply p'ovtd in the failureol the at
tack ot the Aullrian General Latour upon Or
chid. The object of this a'tack was to cap-*
tuie a French detachment that lay in this garri
son, in which the Auflrians totally failed, b&-
fide loling many soldiers, and among the of
ficer- M. C eiger, captain of artillery, vhofe life
was more worth than the whole ganifon an hun
dred times over. The number of Auflrians
thai came to the attack was one thousand. The
place was defended by 50 men of a regiment,
50 dragoons, and 500 soldiers.
July 26. âThe million of Mr. JenkinfoD,
lon to Lord Hawkefbury, to Coblentz, has oc
calioned much speculation here. It may be re
eollefted, that about the time the Jacobine par
ty in France became maflers of the executive,
as well as of the National AfTetnbly, and the ir in
fluence cause 1 a declaration of war against Au
ftiia, I.otd Elg it) was sent to BrulTels with pro
posals of accommodation between the two pow
ers : it is ftnee known that his million was to
have been extended to Vienna, but by this rup
ture it waÂ« prevented. There is no doubt but
I ngland, who declares herfelf perfectly neutral,
has all along meant to inteifere as mediatref at
the moment when France Ihould be attacked by
the combi oed forces. That moment, wc sup
pose, (he now thinks near at hand, and has there -
foie dispatched Mr. Jenkinfon to offer his con
ciliatory ptopofitions to the FVench princes at
Coblentz ; or more probably at Maycnce, con
iideiing that is to be the place of interview with
the new Emperorand the king of Piuffia.

FUNERAL of ADMiR AL J. PAUL JONES.
Letter from Col, Black Jen to Ibe National Affcmb!y t
July 19.
*' Mr. President,
<f I announce to you, that Admiral Paul Jones
died last evening rn Paris: that the American
minister has ordered the.perfjn at whole house the
Admiral lodged, to caufc him to be interred in
the most private manner, and at the least
expenceâThis person, on account of the fot
ma!i ies still exiting relative to protestants,. founo
it necefTary to apply to a commiffdry. He has
done it j and M. S'moneau, the commissary, ex
presses his afto Â»ifhment at the order given by the
n/iniftei, and fays, that a man who has rendered
the most signal services to France and, America
ought to have a public funeral. He adds, that if
Ameiica will not pav the cxpencc, he will pay it
ftimfeif. The friends of the Admiral wait 'the
orders of the afl.embly refpe&ing the mode of in
terment."
(Signed) 5. BLACKDEN,
Late Co % cml in the fer*uice of the United States,
After hearing the letter, the aflembly Ordered,
that ? deputation of twelve members Should aliili
at the funeral of Paul Jones. The. next day this
tieputauon, preceded by two huiftiers, and escort
- Â«d by horse-guards, came 10 the houie of the pe
ceafed, and at leven o'clock the funeral procelli<jn
moved f.om the hpufe in the Rue Tonfon, puffed
the Pont Neuf, entered tha street rhat leads to St.
liuHaehe, pafied on. to the Bv>ulevarÂ«Je bv the rue
St. Martin, and, at the end of an hour and a half,
arrived at the place of fepuJturev '1 he body be
ing depofued, M. Marron* a Proteflant minister
cf Paris, pronounced the foWowiflg discourse s
" Legiflatort, citizens-, Soldiers, brothers and
/riends,Wc have just reftorecj 10. the earth the re
licks of an iHuftriotis stranger, one of the fi*ft he
roes of American libertyâof that liberty which
was the glorious prelude to our own. The Semi
jamis of the north had drawn him tq her ttand
*rd : but Paul J >nes could not long breathe ihe
imprisoned air of uefpotifm, He preferred the se
renity of a private life,'in the free kingd/m of
N Prance, to all the titles and pretended honours
that Catharine could lavifli upon him from the
throne of usurpation. The fame of the brave fur
lives the ftr'oke of death his inheritance is im
mortality ! What homage more flattering can
we under to the memory of Paul Jone-s, than to
swear upon his tomb 44 to live free Or die ?" It is
the full deie-minatiyn, it is rhe united voice of all
good Frenchmen, that tyrants and.tbeir infamous
abetto>Â« thai! never fully tliis sacred land.
While the enjoyment of an undi,fturbed repose
5s here allotted to the ashes of thac great man,
who, impatient to be free, has too soon quitted
the Ipciety of men : let his example teach p.ofteri
ty to what sublime efforts the hatred of oppression
may inspire an elevated: foul ! Brothers and
Friends, a generous emulation sparkles in . your
eyes j your moments are preciousâthe country 'n
in danger. W!jo among us wuuld not pourou l
his blood for her defence ? Be partaker?, then in
the of Paui Jon?s } imitate him in that
contempt of danger, that noble Heroism, which,
after having astonished the present generation,
lhall remain the unchangeable objedt of venerati
on for ages to come."
The American minister could not attend the
funeral ; as he had some persons to dine with him
on that day*
Additional Declaration by his Most Serene High
ness the/eigning Duke of Brunfwick ana Lu
uenburgh, addrefled to the inhabitants of
France.
THE Declaration which 1 have addrefled to the
inhabitants of France, dated Quarters General, at
Coblentz, July 25, must have fufliciently maoe
kwown the firm refjlves of their majeflies the
emperor and the king of Pruflia, when they en
trusted me with the command of their combined
armies-âThe liberty and the fafety of the facreo
persons of the king, of the queen, and of the roy
al family, being one of the principal motives
which have determined their imperial and royal
majesties to aÂ£l in concert ; 1 have made known,
by my said the inhabitants of Pa
lis, my resolve to infiift on them the most .terri
ble punishments, if the least insult should be of
fered to his molt christian majesty, for whom the
city of Paris is particularly rclponlible. i
Without making the least alteration in the 8clÂ»
article of the said declaration of the 25th instant,
I declare, besides, that if, contrary to all expec
tation, by the perfidity or baseness of some inha
bitant! 6( Paris, the king, the queen, or any
other persons of the royal family, Ihould be carri
ed off from that c.ty, all the places and towns
wbatfoever, which shall not have opposed their
raH age, and fliall not have stopped their proceed
ings, ftiall incur the fame piinilhmcnts as those
inrfifled'on the inhabitants of Paris j and the
route which shall be taken by those who carry oft
the king and royal family, shall be marked
with a lerics ofexemplary punishments, juilly due
to the authors and abettors of crimes for which
there is no remission.
All the inhabitants of France in general are to
take warning ot the dangers with which they are
threatened, and which it will be impoflibie for
them to avoid, unless they, with all their m'gnt
and bj every means in their power, oppose the
.>aflageof the king and royal family, to whatever
place the faÂ£tipiis may attempt to carry them.
Their imperial and royal majesties wi.l not allow
any place of retreat to be the free choice of his
most chiiftian majesty (in cafe he llnuld comply
with the invitation which has been made) unless
1 hat rcirear be cfteÂ£ted under the escort which Iras
been offered.
All the declarations whatever, which flialjbc
made in the name of his most christian maiefty,
which shall be contrary to the object which their
imperial and royal majesties hav; in view, fhali
bd confiiered as null and without effect.
