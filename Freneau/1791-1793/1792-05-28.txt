Approved, May eighth, 1792.
G. WASHINGTON,
President cf the United States.
Speech of Mr. SMITH (member of the
House of Reprefcntatives, from Nezo-
Hampf.ireJ on the motion of Mr. Mer
cer, as amended by Mr. Madfon, that
payments to the loan for the assumed debt
be made on the debt of the several fates
discharged fmce the treaty of pe. ee, as
well as that which is undifiharged.
1 HE ill policy of any afTumption of
the state debts, has been alferted, and in
my opinion, very fatisfaftorily proved
in the discussion which this lubjeft has
already undergone.
I aking it for granted, for the present,
that an alfumption, in some form, mult
take placeâl rife to offer my sentiments
in favor of the amendment proposed bv
the gentleman from Maryland. The
mealure, as contemplated by the Secre
tary of the 1 reafury, is, as I have ob
served, impolitic, as it will greatly ,en
cieafc the public burthen, already too
gieat, lor the resources of which, the
United States, in this infant state of
their government, can avail themselves :
but it is a!(o unequal, and as it rclpefts
several of the Hates, very unjust, as it
[addles them with the debts of other
states. Because they have exerted
themselves fuccefsfully in effecting the
extinguiftiment of the debts w'Jfidi they
contrasted in the common defence, they
are now to be loaded with the debts of
those states, who have made no such
exertions.
If any gentleman will take the trouble
of examining the firft aftumption, and
will add to it what is proposed now to
be aifumed, he will find, that the sums
so alfumed, from the respective states,
are not such as would have resulted
from a due apportionment of the whole
sum alfumed among the several states in
the union, according to their refpeftive
numbers.
7 o vindicate an assumption so une
qual and disproportionate, gentlemen
must prove to us, that the payments
which the several states have actually
made towards the general defence, have
been in exact proportion to their abili
ty, that is, according to their numbers.
They must fatisfy us that South-Caroli
na, though ftie had previous to any as
sumption, fix millions of dollars of state
debt undischarged, had nevertheless dis
charged as great a portion of debt in
curred in the war, as any other state in
the union, and that the reason why she
had then so great a state debt, pressing
heavy upon her, wasnot because she had
â ot exerted herfelf, according toherut
moft ability, to dilcharge that debt; but
because (he had contraftsd a debt much
beyond her just proportion ; âthat is, in
fact, that upon a final settlement of ac
counts she would have a balance due
equal to the sum which constitutes the
difference between her just proportion
of the whole sum assumed, and the sum
actually alfumed ; which is in this cafe,
more than four millions of dollars.
The fame reasoning would apply t6
the other states who have sums assumed
beyond their just proportion. Upon
these principles too, they must prove to
us that New-Hampshire, upon a final
settlement of accounts, would be found
in debt to the union more than seven
hundred thousand dollars : that is, that
she is the greatest delinquent in the
union. I ask gentlemen if they have
any documents to prove this.
It would be easy to fatisfy an inhabi
Unt of Maflachufetts or South-Carolina"tnSt they were great creditors, <,nd thai
JJew-Hampfhire is a verv great debtor.
Jbut it will require something more than
the confident affortions of gentlemen,
to convince-the state I represent that thi:
is really the cafe ; they believe, and they
v.'i-1 continue in this well-founded be
]:<:Â«, 4 ill some evidence appears to the
contrary, that they at least contributed
their just proportion towards the gene
ral defence. Some states, no doubt,
from the rnam;er in which they were
peculiarly circumstanced, may have
done more than in proportion to New-
Hampshire, while I am persuaded thai
others 'have -done less. The Unitec
States have uniformly proceeded upon
the idea, that the states who have done
more than their proportion, should have
credit m a general settlement, while
J hole who have done less, should be
compelled to pay the balances due from
their,. I have no doubt but that Tome
of the ftsn.es, -who now have debts un
.iffumed, will be found entitled to ba
lances, but 1 deny that New-llampfhire
can |ultly be called upon for the payment
of them.
Congress have uniformly taken it foi
planted, that the inequalities which
jnay have existed in the exertions of the
several states, can only bo remedied by i
settlement of all accounts between the
United States and the several states. Ai
great expence they have c'ftablifhcc
boards of commi {lionets, with very am
ide powers; they have sent commission
ors into the leveral states, to receive and
â adjust their claims ; âthe states have
been at very great expence in stating
their accounts, and procuring the necef
iary vouchers to lupport them.
But gentlemen have now made a dis
covery, which, if it had been made in
ieafon, would have laved all this trouble
and expence: they have discovered.
that the leveral states in the union have
laid equal burthens on their citizens tc
carry on the war and to dilcharge the
debt incurred in the common defence,
and that equal justice required at the
commencement of this new government
in 1789, that the United States should
ftcp in between the states and their cre
ditors and cafe them of their debts. But
the gentlemen who have made this dis
covery, are too much intercfted to ex
pedf. full credit to their sentiments on
this head.
It happens somewhat unfortunate for
this hypothecs, that those who maintain
it, are thole who are to be gainers by it.
li may well be expe&ed that less evi
dence will fatisfy South Carolina that
ihe is a creditor state, than New Hamp
shire.that she is a debtor'; and more cf
(ficacioas iogic must be used to induce
the latter to pay 7 or 8 hundred thou
sand dollars of the debt of the former,
than to periuadethe former to put that
burthen off her own Ihouldcrs and lay
it upon the latter. Let not gentlemen
imagine that New Kampfhire, though
ihe is a small state and of no great im
portance in the union, patiently submit
ted to the injufticeot the former afiump
tion. They remonstratedâThat re
jnonftrance is now on your table. ;Why
did they complain ? Because in that af
iumption they were conlidered as the
greatest debtor of any state tn the union:
.and because they were, as a constituent
part of the union, called upon to pay 7
or 8 hundred thousand dollars .of the
debt of South Carolina, Maffachuietts,
or some other state. Why should it be
taken for granted, they alk, that we are
a debtor ? What documents are gentle
men possessed of, that juftify such a fuo
polition ? Let them be produced. If
the opinion -of gentlemen, who have
spoken within these walls and without,
is to be relied upon, there is scarce a state
in the union but that has done-far more
than her proportion- Jo .that there mull:
be a great balance due to each state. All
this tends to (hew that it is unreasona
ble to expedt that any one state will pa
tiently submit to a measure which takes
that for granted, which they do not be
lieve, and which it is never their inter
est to admit. There never was, in my
opinion, but one principle which could
juftify any allumption previous to a fi
jiaiiettiemeat ; and that was giving re
lief to dates who had unquestionably
contra&ed a debt much â  beyond their
just proportion, and who were groaning
beneath -the burden of that debc. Where
it could be known with tolerable cer
tainty that a balance would be filially
feiueto such a state, much might be laid
n favor of anticlpa': in g the payment of
it. But was this the principle which
governed? Was this principle at all pur
luedPWere 2,200,000d<>15. assumed from
Pe'twifyl vania, becauic ftic was or would
be a creditor (lateâor bexaule flie was
heavily burthened with debt ? Will
gentlemen undertake to fay, that any
principle at all was adhered to in the
assumption ? Was it not a mere bargain
and sale between certain (bates who were
interested, that an assumption should
take place ; and who, provided they
could be only exonerated from their
own debt, would not flick at anv means
to accomplish so dertrablea thing. Was
it not at the expencc of ]uftice, and al
the expence of certain states, pai ticu
larly at the expence of the state 1 repre
sent. If the Rates, who had the largefi
portion of debt to struggle with, at the
adoption of the prelent constitution.
were to be relieved, such relief jmight
have been afforded without any viola
tion of the principles of justice and
equality. The United States might have
afforded a temporary relief till the ac
counts were fettledâorif it was thought
best to assume the balances due froir
those states to their creditors, a pro
portionate sum (which is what I now
advocate) should have been assumed frorr
every other ffate. The United State;
could never advance a sum to anv one
ffate without advancing a proportionate
one to every other state, without at the
fame time, declaring that the one hac
better pretentions to such a grant thar
the otherâand what can authorize fuel
a declaration P I know of no data or.
which to found it. A gentleman frorr
Massachusetts objects to thisâHe lavs,
this would greatly increase the public
debt : and he appears now to be a great
enemy to such an increase. When thi;
argument was urged aguinft any assump
tion it was treated with great contempt,
it seems however that gentlemen have
no obje&ion to increaiuig the public
debt, as far as the debts of their respec
tive ffates will do itâThey do not wifb
to go fartherâThey aie against accu
mulating the publicdebt, if they are not
to have the whole benefit of it. ' If they
are in favor of an assumption, they
should be in favor of an equal one.
Some gentlemen have taken much pain*
to convince us that the citizens
states are zealous for the measure. I
am not,difpolcd to doubt it. If they
can have their burthens taken from
their shoulders and placed upon then
neighbour's, it is not to be cxpe&ed that
they should complain. But becauic the
winners are pleased, it by no means fol
lows that the loofers are pleased too.
iiut we are told that the inequalities ol
both assumptions will be remedied by the
settlement. Who is it expected will be
deceived by this ffate device ? Is there
any one lo ignorant ? What is it but fay
ing, Submit to jnjuftice now, and,we
wiil redress it hereafter. Only be fc
kind as to acknowledge now that you
are a debtor state, and we will be much
abliged to you, and if it lhould turn out
an settlement of accounts, that you have
been paying our t debts for us, we will
then repay you. But do not these fame
perlons tell us, that the accounts nevei
will be fettled ; or if they are, that ba
anccs never will be paid or receivedâl
oelieve it, I consider this assumption a;
ligning the death warrant of the settle
ment of accounts.
1 herefore, let the assumption beequal.
If any takes place at this time, I hope
it will be a just and equal one; nay
more, that it .will redress the inequali
tics of the former one ; and that th?
states who have laid heavy hurthens on
their citizens, will not be punilhed for
theirlaudablc iriÂ£-xutiguifhing theii
defe-ts, but that they will at lejt fare as
well .as those who have made no such
exertions.. In one word, I am again fl
any assumption., but it any assumption
obtains, as it cannot be known which
state is debtor or whi.chrreditor, let the
sums assumed from each be equal, that
is, according to their respective num
bers.

recting their aoiifes, and preyenting or re
pelling their encroachment;, which are al
\vays gradual, and advance like the hour

it his conltant business to endeavour to per
suade a people that their government is
without a particle of spot or bleniifh, mull
beget fttfpicion.

No stroke of policy could be more point
edly severe against the political depravity
ofhurope. (in which America is included)
than the edict of China, now ofnearonehun
dred years {landing, that no European
admitted into their Empire. This sweeping or
der is rigidly enforced, to the present day ;
and the 1110 ft dignified characters, in the
line of Amballadors,&c. from Kurope have
not by means of any prefentsor bribes what
ever been able to procure a fight, even of
Canton, except from a refpeftable di.-
tance. It is laid to be a universally receiv
ed opinion in China, that there is no Euro
pean without evil d'fign ; and that nature has
formed them only Jor treaj ns and revolutim.s.
From this prejudice it comes, that our ac
counts of China are so exceedingly defec
tive ; and it is a fasl, that all we know,
with any degree of precision of the internal
situation, population, government, arts,
manufactures, &c. of that country, are tie
rived from some of the firft visitors, whole
accounts are now verging to the date of
two centuries. The Chinese general opi
nion ot the reft of mankind, includes a tacit
reproach upon themselves ; for the fame
reason, that he who believes all men to be
villains is certainly one himfelf. In no
country is knavery so much praftifed as in
China; and there is scarcely a law in their
whole fyitem, that has not a direst aipect
to discourage this odious propensity in
the subjects of that empire.
On the 12th instant the supreme court for

served on this occalion, that the ihameful
negligence, or rather contempt of those
(the jurymen) who prevented the court
from proceeding to business, deserves the
highest censure, und a fine at least adequate
to the expence to which the country is ex

months longer in jail." | Yesâand what
recompence can be made to a man, who
happens at last to prove not guilty of the
crime alledged against him ? or what fine
can be adequate to the loss that a helpless
woman or a number of innocent children,
may luftain in the death of a husband or

Several concurring; foreign accounts fav,
that, from all appearances, the people of
Aulirian 1 landers conficter the death of
Leopold the 2d. as an event favourable to
their hopes of throwing oif their dependen
cy 0:1 the Gcrmanic powers- They are e
ven said to have reared the regenerated
French ffandard, and to have determined to
put themselves under the protection of
France rather than continue longer fubjeft
ed to a foreign despot. At Brufl'els, mat
ters have been carried lo far, that hand
bills have been lluck up every where in the
flreets, exhorting the people to shake off
the yoke of the House of Austria, and ad
vising, if they could not render themselves
completely and finally independent, at lead:
to incorporate themselves with a nation
[the French] who had learnt to think and
aift up to the dignity of human nature. â
To counteract this serious spirit of revolt,
uear sixty thousand troops were already
quartered in the Austrian Netherlands,
when tltele accounts came away, and num

of military llores, adequate to a great un

The following is related of the late king
of Pruflia, asalacf : "one of his dogs (of
which species of animals he was remarka
bly fond) being lick, Frederick being then
in Silelia, gave orders that a courier lbould
be sent every day to bring him an account
of its littiatioii. On hs return, finding the
little animal was dead and buried, he cati
fed it t;Â» be taken from the earth, that he
might have the pleasure of feeing it once
more; thut himielf up the whole day, and
.cried for it like a child".âThis, among ma
ny other instances, might be brought as a
proof of the execrable nature of Royalty,
which can occalionaliy feel for the brute
creation, but never for the miseries of its
own fpecies.âlt was well said by Mr.
Paineâ"As nature had no hand in forming
kings and emperors, neither are they poi
felled of the genuine feelings of nature".â
The late fndden change in the Spanish go

The people were dillatisfied, and it was
neeeifarv to shew a semblance of facrificing
to their opinion. Count Florida Blanca is
no oKierwife disgraced than being ob iged
to retire to his own personal eltate, in the
province of Murcia ; which molt persons
after lb long and laborious a confinement
to political affairs, would rather esteem a
comfort than a matter of regret; iinecure
appointments are continued to him. In
i:ead ot the government of Spain being
guided by qae men, as heretofore, it will
jow of u.ld<T the tiireSion of a council, of
which the king is the head, and Count d'

European Spectilatifts, in the late print's'
leemto disagree in their ideas relativetothe
part the luccelfor o' the emperor ofGermatiy
will take in countenancing, or arting againlt
the French revolution. German and
Dutch papers do not fail to afiert, that he
is in the interell of the French emigrants,
and will do his utmost to bring about a
counter revolution in France, at least so
far as to restore the nobility, and certain
prerogatives of the crown. Others fay,
that the death of Leopold the second has,
moll probably ruined the hopes of the emi
grants, " it being evident that the German
Princes muff now be entirely occupied with
the affairs of their own country, and the
election of a new emperor, which mult cer
tainly employ them for more than a year,
and occupy that attention which otherwise
would have been given to the interests of
the French princes, who have nothing to
depend upon but their own strength, which,
in fait, is now nothing; as it is very pro
bable that the emperor's death, dissipating
every fear of a ierious war, may tend to
concentrate the minds of the people in
France, no longer divided upon their mea
sures with LeopoldâUnder this point of
view, the event is fortunate for the French
constitution, and perhaps more general li
bel ty: For it would be voluntary blind
ness to believe the pacific intentions which
have been so loudly trumpeted abroad."

OPINION.
Wonderful, indeed, is the influence of
opinion upon mankind ; and to such a de
gree does it operate upon the human con
stitution, that happiness itfelf is generally
found to confifl therein. What makes so
many nations happy, who are seated in the
mod barren and contemptible spots of this
earth, but opinion ? Opinion upholds al
1110ft every government in the world, and
should the weight of opinion be once
brought against them, their downfall is in
evitable. Were opinions unchangeable,
governments, even the mofl cruel and op
pressive, would forever be the fame ; fortu
nately, however, in some degree, for man
kind, the mutability of opinion is the cause
of revolutions in the great political wheel
of government, which gives every nation
its turn to be iippermoft as well as lower
most ; and allows them their intervals of
pleasure, as well as of pain. Perhaps in no
country is opinion of a more fickle and

Mr Printer,
The letter herewith, wa* lately trans
mitted from a relpe&able Pennfylvanian,
to Thomas Paine, (Author of the Rig/ts
of Man and other republican pamphlets)
formerly known tt> him in America. If
you think fit to infer* it in your much ap
proved paper, it is at your service.
F. Z.
Friend Thomas,
I have perused thy publication with as
much thought and reflection as I am pos
sessed of. I therein descry conliderable, but
uncultivated ingenuity, and much seeming
zeal (but without, knowledge) for politi
cal reformation. Polfibly there may be
truth in some of thy remarks, and verily do
I hope thou haft some good will towards
mankind, although I think thee grol'slv
mistaken in thy notions of good govern
ment. âThough an American, I am not
so bigotted as thou art to republicanism.
and only prefer it (as many of my thinking
brethcren here,do) to a worse form of go
vernment, I mean despotism in its true
sense; not according to thy overstrained ac
ceptation.
Now, perhaps, from thy 'ate refideilce
in France, thou mayeft have imbibed some
of their fopperies in dress as well as of poli
ty. From hence thou mayeft conceive,
my broad brimmed hat hath too much the
efteel: of keeping me in obfeurity as to some
objetts, and would not recommend me to
forego the comfort, convenience, and (bel
ter I have always been accultomed to ex
perience from it, for the fake of acquiring
more light unto inyfelf by cropping, and (to
borrow thy own favorite phrase) regenera
ting it into a new form, (becanfe truly thy
1* rench friends have adopted that mode) and
thereby to expose myfeif to much greater
evils, which in its present state I ;:m not
liable to . I will readily grant thee, that
the more I should crop and curtail my
beaver, the nearer I should approach to man
in hisprimitive state, when hats and breech
es were alike in disuse. But pardon me
friend Thomas, when I afl'ert, that vain
will be thy endeavors to cry down the ufr
of the one or the other, as far as I am con
cerned, (in spite of the benefits 1 derive
from them)until, like thee, I shall have cast
off even the exterior of modeftv and deco
rum, and, moreover, like thee, have turn
ed my back 011, and become zealous to re
probate what has hitherto afforded me
comfort and protection.

Although in all the German papers it i?
â circulated that the army of the French
emigrants is, as it were, entirely dispersed.
it is not less certain that every preparation
is making in silence for an attack on Alsace
towards the end of April or the beginning
â¢of May.
The Stadtholderian "Court, (of Holland)
altho' acting less openly than other powers,
is, notwithstanding, one of the principal re
sources of the noble emigrants. It supplies
them with the money they want: and it is
supposed that one banking-house alone has
already furnifhed them with above three
millions of florins, besides what has been
received from Rotterdam and the Hague.
There is besides a rendezvous of recruits, on
the frontiers of Gueldres, and scarcely a
week pafles in which as many as 20 men do
not proceed thither, in consequence of ha
ving been secretly engaged for-the service of
the princes. It is tine that these recruits
are, for themoft part, French, Liegeois, or
Brabantine deserters, upon whose fidelity
little reliance can be had, L and that they
must form in general very indifferent
troops, but this procedure does not less ex
ill, and prove that the electors have no seri
ous intention of abandoning the emigrants.
It is remarkable, that European monar
chical and European clerical power have
always gone hand in hand ; that is, where
the temper of the world was such that mo
narchy was fuffered to be on its high horse,
the clergy (after their own theocratical
Teign was at an end) were mounted upon
one very little, if at all, inferior; being, in
faÂ£t, the real directors of the movements oi
the great machine, behind the curtain. One
of their chief political steps towards the
support of monalrchy and despotism ha;
been their imprefling a belief upon mÂ«n
kind that the whole race is vicious and de
graded by nature âfor, if so, the several
nations of the world would, no doubt,
want religious quacks to put them in the
light way, who would not fail to persuade
them that non-resistance and paflive obedi
ence to tyrants were two preliminary qual
ifications forparadil'e '. When once a man i>
brought to believe that he is of a villainous
diabolical constitution, 5 as he came froir
the hands of nature, he is .a fit fubjeft foi
the ilave of a despot, or a mitred bishop :
aad may be prielt-ridden and king-riddei:
at the pleasure of either.
TIDES.
[Tranjlatcd From the French.~\
THERE was an ancient pretender to philo
sophy whose conllant faying was Malim cum A
rijictele errare quiam cum aliis recle /entire. â" !
iud latherlhink wrong with AiiftoUe, thanrigh,
with other philosophers."âThere are many ir
the present age who in like manner are rigic
retainers to Newton, in points where even hf
himfelf tacidy acknowledges that he may b<
jniQaken.âThus, in his Principia, when speak
ing of Lunar attraction on the waters of the ocean,
lie declares, that there imijl be fame hidden cause 11
nature, excLuftve of and independent of the attrac
tion of the moon, that occasions thai periodica
fwett in the ocean, called tides, in all their pheno
mena. âOne great argument, and which leem:
to preclude the neccflity of many others again!)
the main principle of the Newtonian theory 01
tides, is there being no tides, or next to none,
in mod of the latitudes of the tori id .zone, tha
is to fay, from the equinoxial line to lat. 15
16 and even to 20 deg. north and south. âl!
the moon ailed on the ocean in the manner com
monly supposed, her influence would ceitainly
be moil peiceivable in thole parts direflly undei
her, and not in the high northern and foutherr
latitudes, as is conflantly found to be the cafe.
