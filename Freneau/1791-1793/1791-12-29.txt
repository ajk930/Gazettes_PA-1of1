Vol. I.
Report on Manufactures.
( Continued.)
VJL to the creating, in some inftanccs, a
yew, and securing in ill a more certain and Jieady
Ufnand. for the Jutplui produce of the foil.
THIS is among the most important of the cir
cumtt'ances which have been indicated. It is a
principal mean, t>y which the eftablifliment of ma-;
Jiufadtures contributes to an augmentation of the:
produce or revenue of a country, and has an im
mediate ana dueÂ£t relation to the profpeiity of
agriculture.
it is evident, that the exertions of the huf
tandman will be steady or fluctuating, vigorous or
leeble, in proportion to the steadiness or fluctu
ation, adequatenefs, or inadequatenefs of the
markets on which he must depend, for the vent
of the surplus, which may be produced by his
labor j and that such surplus in the ordinary;
course of things Will be greater Or less in the
fame proportion.
For the purpose of this vent, a domestic mar
ket is grt atly to be preferred to a foreign Qne j
because it is in the nature of things, far more to
be relied upon.
It is a primary objeCl of the policy of nations,
to be able to supply themselvesâ¢ with subsistence
from their own foils jand manufacturing nations,
as far as ctrcumftances permit, endeavor to pro
cure from the fame iource, the raw materials ne
eeflary for their own fabrics. This disposition,
uiged by the spirit of monopoly, is foxnetimes
even carried to an injudicious eXrreme. it seems
not always to be recolleCted,' that nations, who
have neither mines nor manufactures, can only
obtain the manufactured articles of which they
fland in need, by an exchange of the produCts of
their foils ; and that, if thole who can best fur
>l iill them with such articles are unwilling to
give a due course to this exchange, they must of
neceffit) make every polfible effort to manufacture
for themselves j the effeCt of which is that the
manufacturing nations abridge the natural advan
tages of their situation, through an unwillingness
to permit the agricultural countries to enjoy the
advantages of theirs, and facrifice the interests of
-a mutual beneficial intercourse to the vain pro
jcCt of filling every thing and buying every thing.
But it is also a consequence of the policy,
which has been rioted, thac the foreign demand
tpr the produj&aâ  xÂ»f countrieÂ« ? \t 9 in
great degree, rather casual and occasional, than
certain or co'.ftavt. To what extent injurious
interruptions or the demand for some of the staple
Commodities of the United States, may have
been experienced, from that cause, must be re
ferred to the judgment of those who are engaged
in carrying on the commerce of the country 3 but
it may be'fafely affirmed, that such inturruptions
are at times very inconveniently felt, and that
cafea not unfrequently occur, in which markets
arc so confined and restriCted, as to render the
demand very unequal to the supply.
independently likewise of the artificial impedi
ments, which are created by the policy in quef
tfon, there are natural causes tending to render 1
the external denrand for the surplus of agricultu
ral nations a precarioos reliance. The differen
ces of seasons, in the countries which aTe the con
sumers, make immense differences in the pro
duce of their own foils, in different years j ana
confcquentiy in the degrees of their neceiiity for
foreign supply Plentiful harvests with them,
cfpecially if similar ones occur at the fame time
in the countries which are the furnifhers, occa
lion of course a glut in the markets of the latter.
Considering bow fact and how much the pro
gress of new settlements in the United States must
encreafe the surplus produce of the foil, and
weighing seriously the tendency of the system,
which prevails among most of the commercial
nations of Europe 5 whatever dependence may
be placed on the force of natural circumstances to
counteract the effcCls of an artificial policy J
there appear strong reafori* to regard the foreign
dema .d for that iurplus as too uncertain a reli
ance, and to desire a fubititute tor it, in an tx
tenfive domestic m*. kct.
To fccure such a market, there is no other
expedient, than to promote manufacturing esta
blishments. Manufacturers who constitute the
most numerous class, after the cultivators of land,
are for that reason the principal consumers of the
surplus of their labor.
This idea of an extensive domestic market for
the surplus produce of the foil is of the firli con
sequence. It is of all things, that which most
effectually conduces to a fiouri/hing state ot agri
culture. If the effect of manufactories should be
VÂ»to detach a portion of the hands, which would
otherwise be engaged in tillage, it might pollibiy
cause a smaller quantity of lands to be under cul
tivation ; but by their tendency to procure a
more certain demand for the surplus producc of
the foil, they would, at the fame time, cause the
Jands which were in cultivation, to be better im
proved and more productive. And while, by
their influence, the condition of each individual
farmer would be meliorated, the total mass of
agricultural production would probably be encreaf
ed. For this must evidently depend as much, if
iÂ»t more, upon the degree of improvement,
than upon the number of acres under culture.
It merits particular observation, that the mul
tiplication of manufactories not only furnilhes a
market for those articles which have been accuf
torocd to be produced in abundance, in a coun
try j but it iikewife crea ei a demand for such a*

were either unknown or produced in inconsidera
ble quantities* The bowels as well as the furfacc
, of the earth are ransacked for articles which were
before negleCted. Animals, plants and minerals
acquire a otrliry and value, which were before
unexplored.
The foregoing confideratioos seem fuffiertnt to
as general proportions, that it is the
interest of nations to diversify the im:uftrious
pursuits of the individual* whocompofe themâ
* That the establishment of manufactures is calcula |
ted not only to encreafe the general frock of ufe
ful and productive labor ; but even to improve
. the state of agriculture in particular ; certainly
to advance the int&refts of those who are engaged
, in it. There are other views, that will be here
after taken of the subjeCt, which, it is conceived,
. will serve to confirm these inferences.
111. Previously to a further difcufTion of the
, objections to the encouragement of manufactures
which have been stated, it will be of use to fee
what can be said in reference to the particular
situation of the United Stares, agairjft the con
clusions appearing to result from what has been
already offered.
It may be observed, and the idea is of no in
confrderable weight, that however true it might
be, that a state, which poflrfling large traCts of
vacant and fertile territory, was at the fame timt
seCluded from foreign commerce, would find its
interelt and the interest of agriculture, in divert
ing a part of its population from tillage to manu
factures j yet it will not follow, that the fame is
true of a state, which having such vacant and
fertile territory, has at the fame time ample op
portunity of procuring from abroad, on good
terms, all the fabrics of which it Hands in need,
for the supply of its inhabitants. The power of
doing this at least ftcures the great advantage of a
divifron of labor, leaving rhc farmer free to pur
ine cxclufively the culture of his land, and ena
bling him to procure with its products the manu
factured supplies requisite either to his wants or
to his enjoyments. And though it should be
trne, that in fettled countries, the diverfification
ofinduftrv is conducive to an encreafe in the pro
ductive powers of labor, and to an augmentation
of revenue and capital ; yet it is scarcely con
ceivable that there can be any thing of so solid
and permanent advantage to an uncultivated and
unpeopled country) as to convert its Waftesioty
cuTtfvated ancT inhabited diftriCts. If the reve
nue, in the mean time, should be lefj, the capi
tal, in the event, mull be greater.
To these observations, the following appears
co be a fatisfaCtory answerâ
i. If the system of perfect liberty to industry
and commerce were the prevailing system of na
tions, the arguments which difluade a country
111 the predicament of the United States, frnm
the zealous pursuit of manufactures would douot
lels have great force. It will not be affirmed,
that they might not be permitted, with few ex
ceptions, to lerve as a rtfle of national conduCt.
In suCh a state of things, each country would
have the full ber/efit of its peculiar advantages to
com-penfate lor its deficiencies or difadvant ages.
If one nation were in condition to supply ma nu
faCtured articles on better terms than another,
that Other might find an abundant indemnifica
tion in a fupeiior capacity to furnifh the producc
of the foil. And a free mutually bene
ficial, of the commodities which each was able to
lupply, on the heft terms, might be carried or.
between them, fu'pporting in full vigor the indus
try of each. And though the circuniftances
which have been mentioned, and others which
will be unfolded hereafter, render it probable,
that nations merely agricultural, would not enjoy
the fame degree of opulence, in proportion to
their numbers, as those which united manufac
tures with agriculture *, yet the progreftive im
provement of the lands of the former, might in
the end, atone for an inferior degree of opulence
in the meaTrtime j and in a cafe, in whiciioppo
iice considerations arc pretty equally balanced;
the option ought perhaps always to be, in favor
of leaving industry to its own direction.
But the system, which has been mentioned, is
far from characterizing the general policy of na
tions- The prevalent one has been regulated by
an oppofcte fpi,it. The confeq-uence of it is, that
the United States aTe to a certain extent, in the
situation of a country precluded from foreign
commerce. Thsy can indeed, without difficul
ty, obtain from abroad the maÂ»ufaChjred sup
plies, of which they are in want j but they ex
perience numerous and very injurious impedi
ments to the emiflion and vent of their own com
modities. Nor is this the cafe irt reference to a
hngle foreign nation only. '1 he regulations of
lsveral countries, with which we have the mo ft
extensive intercourse, throw serious obftroCtions
in the way of the principal staples of the Uniteo
States.
In such a position of things, the United States
cannot exchange with Lurope on equal ierms 5
and the want of reciprocity would render them
the yiCtirn of a system, which should induce them
to confine their views to agriculture, and refrain
from manufactures. A constant and encreafing
necefiitv, on their part, for the commodities of
Europej and only a partial and occasional de
mand for their own, in return, could not but
expose them to a state of impoverishment, com
pared with the opulence to which their political
and natural advantages authorise them to .ifpire.
Remarks of Lhis kind are not made in the fpi

it ;s no fmaH consolation, that already the
rntalVrcs which have embarrafTed our trade,)
hive accelerated internal improvexffents which
upon ihe whole have bettered our affairs.
To nverfifv and extend rhefe improvements, is
the and fafeft method of indemnifying our-
any inconveniencies, which those or
flmiiar measures have a tendency to beget. If
Europe will not take from us the produCts of our
foil-, uson terms confident with our interest, the
remedy is to ContraCt as fact as poiÃblc
our frcnts of her.
2. The conversion of their waste into cultiva
ted fa;>ds is certainly a point of great moment in
the p -litical calculations of the United States.
But tl t degree in which this may poflilly be re
tarded by the encouragement of manufactories
does not appear to countervail the powerful i'n
duce; icnts to affording that encouragement.
At. Ã¼bfervaiion made in another place is of a
nature to have great influence ucon this Â»nftionâ
; if it ca.-inot be denied, thac the interests even Of"j
; agriculture may be advanced more by having such
of the lands of a state as are occupied under ,;ood
culciV3ti6n, than by having a greater quantity
occupied under a much inferior cultivation, and
if manufactories, for the reafor.s afligned, must'
be admitted to have a tendency to promote aj
more steady and vigorous cultivation of the lands
occupied, than Would happen without them, it
will Â£cMow, that they are capable of indemnify
ing a country for a diminution of the progress of
new leuUments j and may feive 10 encreafe both
the capital value and the incoma of its lands,
even tno* ihey should abridge the nunrber of acres
under '.iiÂ£ge.
But it does by no means follow, that the pro
gress o** jicv* settlements would be retarded by the
extenfr nOf manufactures. The defirfc of being
ast ind* penocfit proprietor of land is rounded on
such ft.ong principled in the human breast, that
where ,i?e opportunity of becoming so rs as great
as it \j in :h* United the proportion will
K- ,-il of . .-.v'' 1'... mu-i iori'
lead to jt, iJPho Would be diverted 1 from it towards
manufactures. And it is highh probable, as al
ready intimated, that the acceffibn* of foreigners,
who originally drawn over by manufacturing
views, would afterwards abandon them for agri
cultural, would be more than an equivalent for
those Of our own citizens, who might happen to
be detached from them,
The remaining objections to a particular en
couragement of manufactures in the United
States n6w require to be examined.
One of tbefe turns 011 the proposition, that in
dnftrv, if left to itfelf, will naturally find its
way to the most ufefiil and profitable employ
ment : whence it is inferred, that manufactures,
without the aid of government, will grow up as
foan and as fact, as the natural stale of things
and the interest ofjhe commoniry may reuuire.
Against the solidity at this hypothecs, iri the
fuli latitude of the terms, very cogent reasons
may be offered. These have relaiion to the
Itiong influence of habit and the spirit of imita
tion, -the fear of want of success in untried en
terprises, the intrinsic difficulties incident to firft 1
efiavs towards Â» competition with those who
have previously attained to perfection in the buii
nefs to be attempted, the bounties, premiums and
other artificial encouragements, with which fo
reign nations second the exertions of their own
citizens in the oranclies, in which they are to be
rivalled.
Experience teaches, that men are often so much
governed by what they are accustomed to fee and
praCtice, that the fimpleit and most obvious im
provements, in the niolt ordinary occupations,
are adopted with hesitation, reluCtance and b)
flow gradations. The fyontaneouy transition to
new pur fa its, in a community long habituated to
difteient ones, may be expected to be attended
with proportionably greater difficulty. When
former occupations ceased to yield a profit ade
quate to the subsistence of their followers, 01
when there was an absolute deficiency of employ
ment in them, owing to the fupe.rabundance of
hands, chanpes would ensue j but these changes
would be likely to be more tardy than might con
sist with the interest either of individuals or of
the society. In many cases they would not hap
pen, while a bare support could be ensured by an
adherence to ancient courses j though a relbit.io
a more profitable employment might be practica
ble. To produce the defvrable changes, as early ab
maybe expedient, may there fore require the in
citement and patronage of government.
The apprehension of failing in new attempts is
perhaps a more serious impediment. There are ;
dispositions apt to be attracted by the mere no
velty of an undertaking j but these are not al
ways those belt calculated to give it success. To
this, it is of importance that the confidence of
cautious, sagacious capitalists, both citizens and
foreigners, ftiould be excited. And to in Ipi re
this description of persons with confidence, it is
essential, that they should be made to fee in an>
projeCt, which is new, and for that reason alone,
if for no other, precarious, the prospeCt of such a
degree of countenance and support from govern

ments tj be imitated are previously introduced,

course of this report will bs cited) that certiin na
tions grant bounties on the exportation of particu*

the undertakers of a new manufacture have t>*

of a new undertaking, but with the gratuities ~nd

all the adventitious barriers to a fuccefsfdl compe
tition, which may have been ereeither by the'
advantages naturally acquired frc.n practice and
previous pofteilion of the ground, or by those which
may have fpruo-g. from positive regulations and an
artificial policy. This geneial reflection mighe
alone fuffice as an answer to the objection under
examination 3 exclofively of the weighty confeder
ations which have been particularly urged.
The objeCtions t to the purfuic of manufaCVares in
the United State?, ,which next prefert. tnemlfelves
to discuss.on, rcprefent an impraCt'cabiiity of suc
cess, arifiog from three causesâsear city of hands,'
deainefs of labor, want of capital*
The two firft are to' a certain ex
tent real, and, within due limits, ought to be ad
mitted as obffacJes to th 4 fucceis of manufacturing
enterprise in the United States. But there are va
rious confideiations, which lei Ten their force, and
tend to afford an assurance that ihey are not fulfi
qient to prevent th<e advantageous profeeution of
many Very ufeful and extensive manufactories.
With regard to scarcity of hands, the faCi itfeif
must be applied with no imall qualification to cer
tain parts of the United 1 States. There are
dift'riCts, which may be considered as pretty fully
peopled ; and which notwithstanding a continual
drain for distant lettlement, are thickly inter
spersed with flourifhing and encreaftngtowns. If
these distriCts have not already reaehed the point,
at whi-ch the complaint of scarcity of hands Ceases,
they are not remote from it, and are approaching
fact towards it: And having perhaps fewer attrac
tions to agriculture, than some other parts of th*?
union, they exhibit a prcportionably stronger ten
dency towards other fcind3 of industry, Jn these
diftri&s, may be discerned, no inconsiderable ma
turity for manufacturing eftabliihments,
Btit there are eircumil'ances, Which have been
already noticed with another view, that materially
diiriiniih every where the effe& of a scarcity of
hands. These cirCumstances areâthe great use
which can be made of women and children 7 on
which point a very pregnant and-' instruCtive fadt
has been mentioned ; the va-ft extenfron given by
late improvements to the employment of machines*
which substituting the agency of fire and water,
has prodigioully lefifened the ntceility sos manual
labor ; the employment of persons ordinarily en
gaged in other occupations, during the seasons, or
hours of leisure ; which, besides giving occasion
to the exertion of a greater quantity of labour by
the fame number of persons, and thereby encreaf
ing the general rtock of labor as has been elsewhere
remarked, may also be taken into the calculation,
as a refourcefor obviating the scarcity of handsâ
laflly, the attraction cf foreign emigrants. Who
ever inspeCts with a careful eye, the composition
of our towns, will be made fenGble to what an ex
tent this resource may be relied Â»pon. Tiaii'

- The Respectful Petition of the
s Chrijlian Society of Friends called
1 Quakers, dtlivercixbefjre the National
t Afiembly of France, Thursday, 10ih
February, 1791.
s RifpeQabk Ltgifiators,
' ' I 'HE french nation having appoint
r Jl ed you her Legifiators, and your
- heartshavii'ig been dilpofed to enact
: wife laws, our minds have been deep
-1 ly engaged to solicit the extension of
f your jullice and benevolence to the So
s ciety of peaceable Christians to which
â¢ we belong.
- You know that in several states of
Europe and North-America, there are
1 a great number of Christians known by
- the name of Quakers, who profefs to
- fcrve God according to the ancient lim
t plicity of theprimitive Chriftianchurch.
1 Several towns and villages of Langue
- doc contain a number of families at
- tached to this primitive Christianity.
â  Many other families which came from
- America, have fettled at Dunkirk, un
der the auspices of the late govern
> ment. in conl'equence of the invitation
Â» given to the inhabitants of Nantucket,
for the purpose of extending the French
Fifherics.
These islanders have proved them
; selves worthy of your kindness by their
success ; and the fame motive will in
duce them to continue to deserve it.
Concerns, however, of far greater mo
ment, have this day brought us before
: you.
In an age signal for the encreafe of
knowledge, you have been struck with
this truth, that confcicnce, the immedi
ate relation of man with his Creator,
cannot be fubjeft to the power of-inan :
and this principle of justice hath induc
ed you to decree a general liberty for al l
forms of Worlhip. This is one of the
noblcft decrees of the French legislature.
Ybu have set a gteat example to the
nations which continue to pesfecute for
religion, and sooner or later, we holpe,
they will follow it.
We are come to implore this spirit of
justice, that we may befufFered, without
molestation, to conform to some princi
ples; and to use some fotms, to which
the great family of Friends callid Qua
kers, have been inviolably attached e
verfince their rife.
Great persecutions have been inflict
ed on us, on account of one of these
principles, but to no purpose. Provi-i
dence hath enabled us to furir.ount
them without using violence. We mean
the principle which forbids us to take
arms, and kill men on any pretence ; a
principle consistent with the holy Scrip
tures ; " Render not," said Christ, "e
--vil for evil, but do good to your ene
mies."
Would to Heaven this principle were
univerfallv adopted ! All mankind be
coming one family, would be brethren
united by acts of kindness. Generous
Frenchmen, you are convinced of its '
truth ; you have already begun to re
duce it to practice ; you have decreed '
never to defile your hands with blood in
pursuit of conquest. This meafurc
brings you,âit brings the whole world,
a step towards universal peace. ' You
cannot therefore behold with an un- '
friendly eye men who accelerate it by
their example. They have proved in
Pennsylvania, that vast establishments
may be formed, raised, and supported
without military preparations, and with- {
out shedding human blood. \
We fubmitto your laws, and only de- 1
fire the privilege of being here, as in o- t
ther countries, the brethren of all men ;j 1
never to take up arms against any. Eng- t
land, and the United States of America \
where our brethren are far more nume- a
rous than in France, allow us peaceably c
to follow this great principle of ou'r re- 1
ligion, nor do they esteem us useless
members of the community. a
We have another request to make, 1
which wc hope you will not refufe us, a
because it flows from those principles t
of juiticc to which you do homage, \
-| In our registers of births, marriages,
- and burials, we have preferyed the sim
, plicity of the primitive church. Our
- maxims forbid uieltifs forms, and limit
t us to thole which are neceftary for aicer
s taining the terms of human "life, confid
ently with the good order of society.â
\ We request that our iimplc registers
may be deemed fufficient to legalize our
marriages and births, and authenticate
our deaths, by causing a declaration
; thereof to be made before a magistrate.
t Finally, we request that we may be
{ exempted froreLaii oaths; Christ having
1 expressly forbidden them in these
h -vyords, "You have heard that it. hath
bee.n said by them of oldtirjie, thpiU fhalt
perform thine oaths but 1 fay unto
- you, swear not at all ; but let your yea
t be yea, and your nay, nay."
t Wife legislators, you are persuaded as
- well as we, that an oath is no assurance
f of sincerity ; that it can give no addi
. tional force to the declaration of an ho
i nest man, and doth not deter a perjurer.
You admit that an oath is but a peculiar
f way of making a declarationâas it
; were a peculiar mode of speech. We
f hope therefore you will not refufe to
5 hear us in ours. It is that of our com
- mon Mailerâthat of Christ.
We trust that we shall not be suspect
- ed of a wish to evade the great p.urpole
. of the civic oath. We are earnest to
. declare in this place, that we will conti
t nue true to the constitution which you
- have formed ; we cherilh and refpett
- it; and it is our full purpose to follow
i its laws in all their purity; on the o
, ther hand, if our words, if'our eviden
i ces are found to be falfe, we willingly
lubmit to the penalties on falfe witnef
- fes and perjurers.
r Can you, refpe&able legislators, hefi
- fate to grant our rsqueit ? Cast your
- eyes on the hi (lory of our Society, in
- the countries in whish we are establish
: ed. More than a century hath elapsed,
and we have never been found in any
f conspiracy against the government. Our
i temperate rule of life forbids ambition
- and luxury, and the purpose of our
, watchful dilcipline is to preserve us in
: the pra&ice of those manners to which
â  we were led by the exhortations and ex
l ample of our founder.
â¢ We esteem employment a duty en
. joined to all ; and this persuasion ren
: ders us active and mduftrious. In this
â  refp.ect therefore our society may prove
, ufeful to France. By favoring us you
encourage industry. Industry nowfeeks
f those countries where the honeil indus
: trious man will be under no apprehen
â  fions of feeing the produce of a century
of labor fnatchcd away, in an instant, by
the hand of pcrfecution. i
Nowthat France isbccoming the asy
lum of liberty, of equal law and of bro
therly kindness, and adds to these sourc
es of prolperity, perfect liberty forevery
| individual to obey the dictates of his
conscience, in relation to the Almigh
ty what profpe&s of advantage will
arise, to induce our brethren who inha
bit less happy climes, to fettle in France,
a country favoured by nature, as soon
as they learn that you have granted them 1
the famecivil andreligious liberty which
they enjoy in England and the United '
States of America.
Such is the refpc&ful petition we
have new found our hearts disposed -
toprefentto you, for the relief of our
brethren in France, and for the good of
a country which we love. We hope
among your important engagements in
reforming this great'empire, and mul- |
tiplying the sources of its happiness, you
will extend your juftjee and regard to i
us and our children : it willbrmg upon
you the reward of the Amighty, and the
love of virtuous men. '

ANSWERof the PRESIDENT. '
Quakers, who have fled from per- t
fecutors and tyrants, cannot but address
with confidence those legidators who i
have, .or the firfl time in made i
the rights-os mankind the basis-os law. t
And France, now reformed. France, in t
the bosom of peace, (which (he will al- f
Ways conlider herfeif bound to revere, i
and which she wishes to all other nati- i
ons) may become another happy Penn- i
fylvania.
" As a system of philanthropy, we (
adopt your principles. They remind c
us, that the origin of every society was 1
a family united by its manners, its affec- i
tions, and its wants ; and deubtlefs those I
would certainly be the most sublime in- ,
, ftitvtiohs, Which- would rerknv the fiu
â  man race, and bring them . back to this
" primitive and virtuous original.
" The examination of your principles
â¢ as a matter of opinion, no longpr con
â  cerns us : we have decided on that Doint.
- There is a kind of property which no
: man would put into the common stock :
- the motions of his foul, the freedom of
; his thought. In this sacred domain,
i man is placed in a hierarchy far above
, the social state. As citizen, he mult
: adopt a form of government :âbut, as
; a thinking being, the universe is his
: country. j
i "As principles of religion, your doc
: trines will net be the fubjeft of our de-
I liberation. The relation of every man
i with the Supreme Being, is independ
ent of all political institutions. Be
; tween God and the heart of man, what
; government would dare to interpose !
" As civil maxims, your claims mull
- be fubmitt'ed to the difcuflion of the le
. giflative body. We will examine whe
r ther the forms you oblerve in order to
t ascertain births and marriages, be fuffi
; cient to authenticate those descents
j which the division of property renders
- indifpenlible, independently of good
customs.
" We will consider whether a de
: claratioji, fubjettto the penalties against
) falie witnesses and perjury, be not in
. fact an oath.
j " Worthy citizens, you have already
t taken that civic oath which every man
r deserving of freedom hath thought a
. privilege rat vr than adqty.
You have not taken God to witness,
r but you have appeale.dto your conscien
ces. And is not a pure conscience a
heaven without a cloud ? Is not that
- p art of man a ray of the Divinity p
r " You alio fay, that one of yourre
i ligious tenets forbids you to take up
. arms, or to kill, on any pretence what
(oever. It is certainly a noble philofo
â  phical principle, which thus does a kind
â  of homage to humanity. But consider
well, whether the defence of yourselves,
â¢ and your equals, be not also a religious
duty"? You would then have been over
powered by tyrants ! Since we have
procured liberty for you, and. for our
selves, why fhouid you refufe to pre
serve it ?
" Had your brethren in Pennsylvania
been less remote from the savages,
would they have fuffcred their wives,
their children, their parents, to be mas
sacred rather than refill ? And are not
stupid tyrants, and ferocious conquer*
ors, also lavages ?
â¢' The aflembly will, in its wifdorn,
consider all your requests. But when
-1 ever I meet a Quaker I shall fay,'
" My brother, if thou haft a right to
be free, thou haft a right to prevent any
one from making thee a Have.
" As thou loveft thy fellow-creature,
fuffer not a tyrant to deilroy him : It
would be killing him thyfclf.
Thou delireft peaccâbut. consider
weakness invites warâgeneral" resist
ance would prove an universal peace.

The army had advanced within about to miles o
the Aiimce towns (perhaps a shorter thffance)an<
on the morning of the 4th, were attacked by fhi
lavages tfn all fides. The engagement Toon be
came general, and in a few minutes many officer
and men were cut off. The fire of the enem)
was chiefly dire&ed at the officers, who were dif
tinguifhed by their dress. They rCifhed on th<
artillery heedless of their fire, and took two pie
ces in an mflant. They were again retaken bj
our troops ; and whenever the artny charged th-:

p great execution, both in the retreat and advance.

The following is the tronfiulion of a Frenc' fatter
from a gentleman in Baltimore, who hadjvft ar

On the 2Â»fl Nov. wc were in peace and quiet
ness when the mulattoes applied to the munici

the municipality, and a large majority was in fa
vor of granting ihem the privileges demanded
but the minority opposed, and got to their aflift
ance a body of the people of the town, whei
they were thus collected, met one of the fre<
people of colour who they took and immediatelj
executed., Upon the mulattoes hearing this

with their arms, they marched to the governmen'
yard, the 2d Port au-Prince regiment paradec
and an . Â£tion began which lasted for a conHdera
! hie time, when the mulattoes set fire to the towr
I in fevetal places, the wind being westerly anc
â¢ high, the flames spread tbiouahout the town witll
a making rapidity, and did notflop until 32 fquarej

part of the town which escaped the flames wai
plundered: the vessel which brought this account,
left Port-au Prince ihe day after the fire, at whicl

An EUay on
COMMERCE and LUXURY.
R.e-printed from the Londan editionâPrice 1/6.
The merit of this Work will be acknow
ledged by every judicious reader. The re-pubJi
:ation of it in this country, at this time, has been
advised by several enlightened patriots. These
wish to promote our n-ational commerce, on the ba
sis of agriculture suid.induftry, a*d free frorn the
base alloy of imposition and gaming. They set
proper value on the conveniences and ornaments
of civiHzeo life ; but deleft that luxury which is
the ofTivnng cf a fiivolous taltr, and the mother
of profligacy, dishonesty, poverty, of r jmber
lefs private and public vice* and misfortunes.
Nov. ?.Z.Sfcliibits & iafgejrtop&cion of ingenious and valua
ble workmen, in different arts and trades, who, by
expatriating from Europe, have improved their
r n condition, and added to the induftrjr and
wealth of the United States* It is a natural in
ference from the experience, We ha*e already had,
that as soon as the United States shall present the
countenance of a serious prosecution of manufac
tures, as soon as foreign artists shall be made sen
sible that the state of things here affords a moral
certainty of employment and encouragement, com
petent numbers of European workmen will trans
plant tliemfelves, effectually to ensure the success
of the design. How indeed can it otherwile hap
pen conlidering the various and powerful induce
ments, which the situation of this country offers j
addressing themselves to so many strong pafiions
and feelings, to so many general and particular in
terests i
Jt may be affirmed therefore, in respeCt to hand's
for carrying on manufactures, that we shall in
a great measure trSde upon a foreign stock ; re
serving our own, for the cultivation of our lands,
and the manning of our (hips ; as far as charatter
and circumstances fhail incline. It is not unwor
thy of remark, that the objeCttoh to the success of
manufactures, deduced from thefcartity us hands,
as alike applicable to trade and navigation, and
yet these are perceived to flourifli, without an\
sensible impediment from thatcaufe*
As CO the deamefs of labor (another of the ob
ffacles alledged) this has relation principally to
two circumstances j one that which ha? been just
difcuflVd, or the scarcity of hands j the other, the
greatness of profits.
As far as it is a confequerice of the scarcity of
Jhands, it is mitigated by all the confederations
Which have been adduced as leflening that defici
ency. It is certain too, that the disparity in this
refpeCt., between some of tiie molt manufacturing
Â£arts of Europe and a large ot the Uni
ted States, is not nearly so great as is commonly
imagined. It is also much less in regard to artifi
cers and manufacturers than in regard to country
laborers; and while a careful comparfon sheWs,
that there is, in this particular, much exaggera
tion ; it is also evident that the effeCt of the degree
of difpariry which does truly exist, is diminished
in proportion to the use which can be made of ma
chinery.
To illustrate this last IdeaâLet it be fuppbfed,
that the difference of price, in two countries, of a
given quantity of manual labor lequifite to the fa
brication of a given article is as ten ; and that
some mechanic power Â»9 introduced into both
countries, wnich performing half the neceflary la
bor, leaves only half to be done by hand, it is evi-
that the difference in the cost us the fabrica
tion of the article in question, in the two coun
triet, as far as it is conneCted with the price of
labor, will be reduced from ten to five, in conse
quence of the introduction of that joweh.
This circiiiftftance is Worthy of the most parti
cular attention. It diminishes immensely one of
the most urged, against the
success of manufactures in the United States.
To procure all such machines as are fcnown in
any part of Europe, can only require a proper pro
vision and due pains. The knowledge of f-veral
of the most important of them is already pofieff d.
The preparation of them here, is in most casts
practicable on nearly equal terms. As far as they
depend on water, lome superiority of advantages
may be claimed, from the uncommon variety and
greater cheapness of fituation9 adapted to miU
feats, with which different parts of the United
States abound.
So far as the dearnefs of labor may be a confe
rence of the greatness of profits in any branch of
business, it is no obftacie to its fuccefi. The
undertaker can afford to pay the price.
There are grounds to conclude that undertakers
of manufactures in this country can at this time
afford to pay higher wages to the workmen they
may employ than are paid to IrmHar workmen in
Europe. The prices of fabrics, in the
markets of the United States, whick will for a long
time regulate the prices of thÂ£ domestic ones, may
be considered as compounded of the following in
gredients. The firft cost of materials, including
the taxes, if any, which are paidupon tnem where
fhey are made ; the expence of grounds, buildings,
machinery and tools; the wages of the persons
employed in the manufactory 5 the profits on the
capital or flock employed 5 the commifiions ol
agents to purchaf; them whe're they are made j
the expence of transportation to the United States,
Including insurance and other incidental charges}
the taies tfr duties, if artj*, and fees of office which
are paid on their exportation j the taxes or duties,
and fees of office which are paid on their impor
tation.
As to the firft of these items, the cost of mate
mis, the advantage, upon the whole", is at piefen 1 .
ortthefideof the United States, and the differ
ence, in their favor, must encreale, in proportion
as a certain and extensive domestic demand shall
induce the proprietors of land to devote more o>
their attention to the production of those materi
als. It ought not to escape observation, in a
comparison on this point, that fomfc of thfe principal
manufacturing countries of Europe are much morÂ«
depehdent on foreinn supply for the materials ol
their manufactures, than wotild be the Unitec
States, who are capable of fopplying themselves
with a greater abundance, as well as a greater va
riety of the requisite materials.
As to the second item, the expence of grounds,
buildings, machinery and tools, an equality may
at least be alfumed ; since advantages in some par
ticulars will counterbalance temporary difadvanti
ges in others.
As to the third item, or the article of wages,
the comparison certainly turns against the Unitec
States j though as before observed, not in so giea
a degree as is commonly supposed.
The forth item is alike applicable to the foreigr
and to the domestic manufacture. It is indeec
more properly a result than a particular, to bi
compared.
But with respeCt to all the remainingitems, the}
aie alone applicable to the foreign manufacture
and in the ftriCtefl sense extraordinaries ; confti
tuting a fern of extra charge on the foreign fabric
which cannot be estimated at less than from n
to jajfCr CCnt on the cost of Â«C *t the manufactory
This sum of extra charge may confidently be
regarded as more than a counterpoile tor the rea)
difference in the price 0/ labor j and is a fatisfac
tory proof that manufactures may prosper in defi
ance of it in the United States.
To the geneial allegation, connected with the
circumstances of scarcity of hands and dearnefs ol
labor, that extensive manufactures can only grow
3ut of a redundant or full population, it will bÂ«
fufficient, to answer generally, that the faCt has
seen otherwise.âThat the situation alledged tc
>e an efrential condition of success, has not beer
hat of several nations, at periods when they had
ilready attained to maturity iD a variety of manu
factures.
The supposed Want of capital for the prosecution
)f manufactures in the United States, is the mofl
indefinite of the objections which are ulualiy op
j>ofea to it.
It is very difficult to pronounce any thing pre
:ife concerning the real extent of the monied capi
tal of a country, and ft'ill more concerning the pro
jortion which it bears to the objeCts that invite
:he employment of capital. It if not Jess difficult
:b pronounce how fai the effirff of any given quan
:ity of money, as capital, or in other words, as a
medium for circulating the industry and property
>f a nation, may be encreafed by the very circum
tance of the additional motion, which is given to
tby new objeCt6 r>f employment. That effeCl.
ike the momentum of descending bodies, may not
mproperly be represented, as in a compound ratio
:o maj's and velocity, Ii seems pretty certain, that
1 given sum of money, in a situation, in which the
juick Itripuffet of commercial activity were little
elt, would appear inadequate to the circulation of
is great a quantity of industry and property, as in
*ne, in which their full influence was experienced.
Jt is not obvious, why the fame objection might
lot 2s well be made to external commerce as to
manufactures J since it is manifelt that our im
nenfe traCts of land, occupied and unoccupied, are
:ap*ble of giving employment to more capital than
s actually bestowed upon them. It is certain,
hat the United States offer a vast field for the ad
vantageous employment ofcapital, but it does not
"oilow, that there will not be found, in one way or
mother, a fufficient fund, for thefuccefsful prose
:ution of any lpecies of indultry which is likely to
>rove truly beneficial.
The following confederations are of a nature to
emove all inquietude on the score of want of ca
pital.
The introduction of banks, as has been fliewn
>n another octafiob, has a powerful tendency to
'Xtend the aCtive capital of a country. Experi
:nce of the utiiity of these institutions is multiply
ng them in the Uni:ed States. It is probable that
hey will be eftabliihed wherever they can exist
vith advantage; a d wherever they can be fup
>ol ted, if administered with prudence, they will
idd new energies to all pecuniary operations.
The aid ot foreign capital may fafely, and with
:onfiderable latitude be taken Into calculation,
ts instrumentality has been long experienced in
>ur external commerce j and it has begun to be
elt in various other modes. Not only our funds
>ut our agriculture and other internal improve
fients have been animated by it. It has already,
n a few iriftances, extended even to our manufact
ures;
Jt is a well known faCt, that there are parts of
idrope, which have more capital, than profitable
lomeftic objects of employment. Hence, among
â¢ther proofs, the large loans continually furnifhed
0 fdreign ttates. And it is equally certain that
be capital of other parts may find more profitable
mployment in the Uni'ed States, than at home.
\nd nocwithftanding theie are weighty iaduce
nents to prefer the employment of capital at home,
ven atlefs. profit, to ast investment of it abroad,
hough with greater gain, ye: these inducements
,re over-ruled, either by a deficiency of employ
nent, or by a very material difference in profit.
sotb these causes operate to produce a transfer of
oreign capital to the United States. 'Tis Certain,
hat various objeCts in this country holdout ad-
which are with difficulty to be equalled
ifewhere ; and under the encreafingly favorable
mprefiions, which are entertained of our govern
rent, the attractions will become more and more
trong. These impressions will prove a rich mine
if prosperity to the country, if they are confirmed
tnd strengthened by the progress of our affairs.
\nd to l'ecure this advantage, little more is necef
ary, than to fofter industry, and cultivate oider
nd tranquility, at home and abroad.
It is not impossible, that there may be persons
ifpofed to look with a jealous eye on the intru
uCtton of foreign capital, as if it were an inftiu
pent to deprive our own citizens of the profits of
ur own iridultry : But perhaps there never could
>e a more unreasonable jealousy. Jnttead of be
ng viewed as a rival, it ought to be considered as
molt valuable auxiliary ; conducing t<> put in
notion a greater quantity of productive labor, anO
greater portion of ufeful enterpiife, than could
xift without it. It is at least evident, that in a
ountry situated like the United States, with an
â¢ifinite fund of resources, yet to be unfolded, eve
y farthing of foreign capital, which is laid out in
nternal ameliorations, arid in industrious eflablifh
ments of a permanent nature, is a precious ac
-Ijlli ti 4
And whatever be the objeCh which originally
ittract foreign capital, when once introduced, *11
nay be directed towards any purpose of beneficia
xertion, which is desired. And to detain ii
.mong-us, there can be no expedient so effectual
is to enlarge the sphere, within which it may b<
lfefully employed : though introduced merelj
-vith views to speculations in the funds, it may as
rerwards be rendered fu-bfervient to the interelb o
agriculture, commerce and manufactures.
But the attraction of foreign capital for the di
reCt purpose of manufactures ought not to bi
deemed a chimerical expectation. There are al
ready examples of it, as remarked in anothe
place. And the examples, if the difpofit.on b<
cultivated, can hardly fail to multiply. Then
are also instances of another kind, which serve u
strengthen thÂ» expectation ; enterprises for im
proving the public communications, by cutting
jnals, opening the obstruCtions in Tivers, an<
eieCting bridges, have received very material an
from the fame foorce.
When tlie mantifaflurirÂ£ capitalist of Europe
lhall advert to the many important advantages,
which have been intimated, in the coutfe ol this
report, he cannot but perceive very powerful in
ducements to a transfer ot himfelt and his capital
to the United Stales. Among the refledhons,
which a molt interefling peculiarity of situation is
calculated to fuggell, it cannot escape his observa
tion, as a circumltance cut moment in the calcula
tion, that the progiefiiVe population and improve
ment of the United States, eiifure a continually
encreafing domeiVic demand fur the fabrics which
he (hall produce, not to be atf'cflcd by any exter
nal casualties or viciliitudes.
But while there are circurnftances fufficiently
llrong to authorise a considerable degree of reli
ance on the aid of foreign capital, towards the at
tainment of the objeif in view, it is fatirfaftory to
have good grounds ot allurance, that there Â»redo
meftic relouices of themselves adequate to it. It
Happens, that there is a species of capital, attually
existing within the United States, which relieves
from all inquietude on the score ot want of capi
talâThis is the funded debt.ââ¢
The effedl ot a funded debt, as a species of capi
tal, has been noticed upon a tormer occasion ; but
a more particular elucidation ot the point seems to
be required by the ltrefs which is here laid upon
itââl his ihall accordingly be attempted.
Public funds answer the purpole ot capital, from
the eltimation in which they are usually held b*
monied men ; and confequenlly from the cafe and
dil'patch with which they can turned into mo
ney. This capacity oi'prompt convertibility into
money causes a transfer of stock to be in a great
number of cases equivalent to a pa) ment in comâ
And where it does not happen to suit tile party
who is to receive, to accept a transfer of ftoclc,
the party who is to pay, is never at a loss to find
elsewhere a purchaferof his llock, who will lumi/ii
him in lieu of it, with the coin of which he itands
in need.
Hence in a found and fettled (fate of the public
unda, a man poiTefied of a sum in them can em
irate any scheme of business, which offers, with as
nuch confidence as if he wete pollelled of an
qual sum in coin:
'1 his operation of public funds, as capital, is too
>bvious to be denied : but it is objected to the
dea of their operating as an augmentation of the
apital of the community, that they feive to occa
ion the JtJiruSim of some other capital to an
qual amount.
The capital which alone they can be supposed
0 dellroy, mud consist of âThe annual revenue,
vhich is applied to the payment of interest on
he debt, and to the gradual redemption of the
irincipalâ The amount of the coin, which is em
ployed in circulating the funds, or, in oihei
vords, in effefling the different alienations which
hey undergo.
But the following appears to be the true and
iccurateview of this matter â
lft. As to the point of the annual revenue re
juiGtc lot payment of interell and redemption e
1 unci pal.
As a determinate proportion will tend to pef
picuity in the reasoning, let it be luppofed tha'
he annual revenue to be applied, correlpondint
A'ith the modification ol the 6 per cent. Hock o:
he United States, is in the ratio of eight upor
he hundred; that is, in the fiift instance, fixot
iccount of interell, and two on account of prin
ripal.
Thus far it is evident, that the capital deflrtfy
â¢.<} to the capital created, would bear no greatei
voportion than Bto 100. There would be with
irawn from the total rnafs of other capitals a fun
)f eight dollars to be paid to the public creditor,
while he would be poilcffed ol a turn of one hun
lred dollars, ready to be applied to any purpose
0 be embarked in any enterpiife, which migh
ippear to him eligible âHeie then the augment
itton of capital, or the excefsofthat which is pro
luced, beyond that which is destroyed, is equa
o ninety two dollars.
To this conclusion it may be ob'efled, that the
Um of eight dollars is to be withdrawn annually
jntil the whole hundred is extinguilhed, and i
nay be inferred, that in process of time a capi
al will be destroyed equal to that which is at hrl
treated.
