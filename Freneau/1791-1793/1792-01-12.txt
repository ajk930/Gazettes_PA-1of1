Continuation of the Memotial upon the
bsft means of improving the Cosh
merce and Manufa&ures of th 4 Unit
ed States.
THOSE who have read the hiftor)
of the civilized world with attention
must have obfervedthe multitude ofdif
Acuities which all infant states have
been obliged to encounter, and the of
forts which government and natipna
industry have been confhrair.ed to make
in order to surmount the obstacles whicl
were opposed to the growth so the use
ful arts and manufa&ures.â~At certair
periods we shall find that a fcareity ol
artists and materials for the support o:
manufactures retarded the progress o:
the belt concerted undertakings. Ai
other times we shall fee, that inadequate
means or a setting out upon erroneou:
principles operated against all the ef
forts of industry. Again we shall dif
qovcr, that the dearneis ofprovifions anc
high wages were powerful obstacles tt
success. The competition of foreigr
manufactures and the low price of im
ported commodities have also contri
buted not a little, at different periods, tc
prevent nations from fuppiying them
selves with their own fabrics. The ef
forts of the moll persevering artists anc
nioft determined undertakers and em
ployers have always come short of the
desired purpose without being affiftec
by the genius and influence of legiflati
on, which again in its turn stood in equa
need of the talents of the rpan of art anc
invention.
The establishing of national manufac
tures has ever appeared an arduous ob
jcÂ£t to the great men of all enlightenec
ages, because they are naturally attend
ed with an increase of subsistence foi
the human species, and afford the mean:
of living to a vast number of individu
als, whose labours under proper direc
tion give a spring to commerce and en
rich their country.
It feemsneceffary that the wisdom o
sovereigns and the industry of individu
als should concur in order to rendei
prosperous, all considerable establish
ments of this nature ; and in proportior
as difficulties increased, in this refpett
the more have all wife legislatures anc
sovereigns exert :d themselves to over
come them, and thus enjoyed the refuli
ofgloryand emolument. To obtain the
end in view, circumstances of neceftit)
have always naturally induced, or ra
ther compelled them to fall upon the
mod proper means to obviate the impe
diments thrown in their way ; but al
the fame time, itmuft be confeffed, thai
a great length 01 time, ancl men of the
firfl rate abilities have been equally pe
ceffary to accomplish fuchundertakings,
2 hefe persons have been universally
honoured with the meritorious title oi
Fathers of their people and the benefac
tors of mankind : but it was only by the
greatest exertions, resolution, andinvin
cible perfeverancethat they attracted the
smiles of fortune upon their endeavours,
Legislative skill, knowledge of laws,
found commercial regulations, patriotic
flffociations, political and financial abil
ities, with an accurate idea of govern,

their fubjefts from the tribute they paid

preiently speak.
We will, in the firftplace, take a view
of Ireland!, after the ravages of the civi
wars in that country. For some tiny
nothing was to be seen in that unfortu
nate illand but the vestiges of fire ai}<
sword; their farms neglected, commere'
annihilated, an exhausted treasury, ant
no other resource for re-eftablifhini
their affairs but the industry of a fma-1
number of inhabitants and the wi(4op
of tlie government.
In this situation, necessity, the mothe
of arts, began to put the inventive povy
ers of people in action, and in a
time produced wonders.. The inceffan
demands for athoufand things,
to mankind in a state of society, excit
edalpiritof emulation throughout tlfl
kingdom, which in a short. time exhi
bited to Europe at largÂ« an example â Â»
industry unknown. In ttr
times of which I stin speaking-, the in
terruption of natipnaf bommeree andth
ex-haufted resources of government pre
vented any afliftance from that quarte
towards the re-eflablifhment of affair
in Ireland. One method only was lef
to recover arts, manufa&uies and com
merce from oblivion ; a fen fib le mai
prppofed patriotic ajjoaations. His ide
was attendee! to, and generally appro*
ed. In a short time sprung up agricu
tural societies, commercial focietios, so
c:iotiei; for encouraging the arU, <Sce. ($-f
These were protected by the govern
ment, and under such influence agricul
ure and manufactures were perfeÂ£tl"
e-eftablifhed, and rendered more flou
rifiling ever.
The Kings of France, always atten
:ive to whatever concerned the publi:
ijood of their nation, did not fail to imi
:ate the conduct of Ireland. An enter
arising spirit soon became prevalen
hro' the Kingdom, although it must bi
ronfeffed, the inhabitants of Brittany

[To be continued.]
The following, [from the Federal Gazette ~
is injerted by requejl.
IN the report of the Secretary of the
Treasury on manufactures, it is laid
down as tfie ur.queftionable meaning oi
the constitution of the United States,
thatCongrefs have power to provide, b\
the application of money, tor any ob
jest, that ponccrns the General Welfare,
terms which he fays are susceptible nei
ther Â°f fpecification nor of
that every object concerns the General
Welfare which in its operation extends,
in fa ft or by possibility throughout the
unionâ-that it is left to the discretion of
the national legislature to pronounce
upon the objects which concern the
General Welfareâthat there seems to be
no doubt that whatever concerns learn
ing, agriculture, manufactures and com
merce are within the sphere of the na
tional councils.
Then queryrr,
li there any object of confcquence for
which money is not neeeflfory or any
pbjeEt at all wht<fi money may
not be applied to, and so be brought
under the power of Congress ?
Is there any objcÂ£t which in its ope
>;:tio,n may not by ppjfilrility extend
through the union ?
Cannot such adifcretion of the naticr.3!
legifiature pronounce all ckjctfs
ever tp eoAccrn the general welfare ?
Can any usurpation of power bt
judged unccraflitutional by thejudicia
authority if the legislature can Con
ftitutionally do whatever, in their dif
ctetion concerns the general actfari ?
Does not what concerns the genera
itttereff of learning, agriculture, vtaiufac
tures and commerce embrace by far ths
greatest part the sphere of legislation ?
May not the fame discretion that car
pronounce.thefc to concern the genera,
welfare, pronounce the fame as to ;
provision for the support of the poor
for the maintenance of an eccleliaftica
eflablifhment, and for every thing el{t
the legislature pleases ?
Does not this da&rine in the RcpOr
knock down every boundary wort!
contending for between the genera
government and tjie state governments
and give an indefinite fupremapy to th<
general government ?
May not an equal latitude of con
ftru&ion knock down all the bounds
ries between the several department
of the general government, and mak<
over such supremacy to the executive o:
take it Wholly to the legislature or ei
the. house thereof ?
vVas not the general government a

â¢world understood as limited to the

general welfare-, and not as clothed b;
these terms with power susceptible nei
ther of fpecification nor of definition ?
If the exposition in the report fhoult
prevail, will not the people of Americ
be under a government which is no
the choice of the people but the choice o

Is there not a degree of mifconftruc

vails, it is commonly in vain to
ittempt to contravei t it. The fanftion
which it receives by being universally
appears fufficient to condemn
ill the arguments that can be brought
jgainft it ; and by this circumstance ina
iy believe themselves convinced of the
propriety of a fentirnent, without giv
ing themselves the trouble of a moment's
:elleÂ£tion, and in some instances they
ire so far prejudiced that they cannot
jttend with .patience to have it imparti
illy canvafTed.
This observation seems to be verified
)y the inhabitants of the United States
Â«vith refpeft to the Indians. There is
carcely an individual who is willing to
loubt the propriety of the present war :
aut those who will candidly, weigh the
irguments on both fides, will find mÂ»-
iy scruples not easily to be obviated,
lhere are a variety of circumstances
.vhich render both its just ice and policy
it lead dubious. The rcafonson which
he propriety of commencing hostilities
s founded, are fugh as theseâThat the
ertility of the American foil is a proof
hat it was never intended to support
;he savages by whom it was fir It inha
bitedâthat the uncultivated state in
A'hich the Europeans found the eoun
:ry, juftified them in taking pQileffion of
; and that afterwards the infidelity
ind cruelty of its original inhabitants,
rendered them the proper objects of
:ontempt âthat the ravages which they
Jaily commit, are incor.tiftent with juf
;ice and tend to retard the fettlemcnt of
3ur frontiersâthat treaties have been
'epeatedly violatedâthat profeffions of
: riend(hip have been mademerely to de
:eiveâand that we cannot expect to
ive in lecurity till the Savages are ren
dered incapable of resistance or entirely
exterminated. But it is inconfiflent
ivith the principles of justice to fuppole
:hat a particular class of men should be
denied the privileges enjoyed by others,
jecaufe they have not been equally
Dlefled by Providence ; they certainly
jnfwer the purposes for which they
were intended, and we cannot be julti
fiable in attempting to oppress them.
The cruelty of the Indians cannot be
ienied ;but is it not just? Have not we,
Dy our own conduit, juftified them in
:ommitting the depredations of which
hey are accufcd ? I think I may ven
ure to answer in the affirmative. The
jarbarity and treachery â which has been
nanifefted towards them, by persons
whose better information ought to have
dictated a different conduct, has furnifh
ed them with a plea, that their behavi
3ur is confident with the law of nations.
If they are fuppoled to poifefs the fame
passions with others, can it be expected
hat they will quietly submit to imposi
tion, and ftifle the desire of retaliation,
when opportunities arc daily offered
'.hem ? But even this fuppolition would
lot be more unreasonable than are fre
quently made.
The conduct of the Pennfylvanians,
which has been similar to that of many
jf the states, is fufficient to show that
:he Indians have been improperly treat
ed. Their measures have been nearly
equal to those adopted by the Pops at
.he discovery of Americaâhe publicly
declared the natives to be, at least, equi
vocal men ; permitted the Europeans to
massacre them with impunity and tranf-
Ferred the whole continent to the king
jf Spain. The inhabitants of the back
parts of Pennsylvania have followed his
example, in plundering the savages of
their property âin murdering them,
without provocation, and in refufing to
punish the murderers when detested.
It is further urged, that they have vi
olated solemn treaties; But have notthese treaties bean defective? Have they
not wanted lome of the qualifications
necessary to render them complete con
tracts ? They certainly, have. They are
not then binding, and may be broken at
pleasure. The poor natives in many
cases are competed by force, to fubfcnbe
to treaties of which they are entirely
ignorant, and which, were they adher
ed to, wqulddeprive thernof such rights
as they value more than their lives ;
they are not in this cafe to be blamed for
their ignorance, but for our treachery
in periuading them for the lake of a few
trifles/toenter into engagements which
w<)uld require them to remove almofl
from the face of the earth, or to make
such fatrifices as require more
on than We purfejves pofl'efs-. But 1 be
lieve there lias never yet been an in
stance in which an Indian treaty hat
been raufcqd, and afterwards broken, ii
it daferved the name of a treaty, unlets
they were fufficiently provoked, to jui
tify them in breaking it that the
fcharVe of their breaking treaties appears
to be without foundation.
It is also alledgcd, that our frontier
inhabitants are exposed ; but let them
pease to encroach on the Indians by re
moving from their land, and the danger
will be ove;-: we shall then live in peacc.
and we ha\ e no right to expett peace
till thismeafure is adopted ; it would be
absurd tp think that we are intitled tc
the western territory because the King
of England has renounced his claim tc
itâhe had no more right to dispose ol
it, than the Pop? had to, transfer the
whole Continent when firffidiscovered;
It,follows, tljprefore, that until , we ci
" ther pay the natives the full value ol
the land, or remove from it entirely, we
muftpjepeft to fcte exposed to their ven
geance without the jult privilege of re
taliation. And'indeed t|ie general con
duct of the Europeans, fmce the firft dis
covery of America, has evidently tend
ed to oppress the natives, to deprive
them of iheir propertyandto excite then
hatred, They acquired a title to the
land by pie-occupation, but this title
was deemed infufficient, although other;
were supposed to reft their claims or
the fame grounds.
The sovereigns of Europe thought
themielves entitled 10 the foil they dis
covered ; although at the fame time ii
was thickly inhabited, ftillthey contenc
that the Indians have no right to this
privilege ; but the fact is juff the re
vcrfeâthe Indian title is good, and the
European is not, becauie the formei
were the original discoverers, and not
the latter.âBut in fatt, the arguments
that were offered to support the propri
ety of the war, Ihow it to be unjust. and
if it be unjust, it muff necessarily be im
politic ; for although national injuftipe
may seem to produce a partial benefit,
yet in the end it will prove the reverse :
justice and policy being inseparably
connected. Ifthennatio iictl reputation
be a matter of importance, as it certain
ly is, the facrificing of this can nevei
be atoned for by a few acres of uncul
tivatedland. The whole western ter
ritory will be of but little value wher
putin competition with the confidence
and effeem of Europe.
We ought therefore tp give up the
former in order to secure the latter. It
would be impolicy indeed, to facrifice
our reputation for any confideratior
whatever, but particularly for an object
of such a nature as that of the prefem
war. Great Britain has brought on her
felf a : load of infamy by attempting in
justice ; and shall not \yjc be deemed
much more infamous, if, after our late
- profeffions, we adopt the very princi
pies that we before reprobated i'
Are not the Indians in the fame situa
tion with refpeil to Great-Britain at the
commencement of the late continental
war P I think they are. The cases are
at lead; similar. The world juftified us
in refilling tyranny, and it will excul
pate them in oppo.lng opprelfion. Wc
refufed to give away our property with
out consent. They also refufed to give
up theirs without their consent; cart
we then fay that our property is fae'red
and that their's is not ? This would be
subverting the principle on which we
revolted from Great-Britain. Perhaps il
may alio be prudent to consider that in i
juff cause and aided byProvidence, they
are as likely to succeed, and to secure
to themselves a favorable peace, as we
were when in a limilar situation. The
late defeat of the army under General
St. Clair fufficiently evinces that the
Indians are not to be conquered, at even
frightened by the appearance of disci
plined troops, and that the war will be
protraffed to such a length that the e,\-
Dcnces of it would be more than luffici
ent to lecure every object that we hope
to obtain in cafe we now succeed.
It is in vain to fay that the natives have
received the full value of their landâ
they have not received an hundredth
part of its value. In many places they
have been driven from their poffeoflins,
without obtaining the least cqmpenlati
onâand even, in those cases iu which
we pretend to make compensation, we
held the (word in one hand, and with
the other offeied them proposals die-,
tated by our own, avarice. Some
through fear accepted the latter, but
others, much to their credit have cho
len the former. The character of the
Indians has. generally been given by.
interested persons ; such as have either
been injured by them, or have been ac
tive, in opprefiing them, and therefore
want a preten.ee to juitify-their conduit.
It is natural to fuppole that the ill treat
ment they have received, should mate
rially alter their conduct, and in some
mealurc change their dispositionsâbut
when the Europeans fir ft came to this
Country, they found them in a state of
innocent simplicity ; had the. fucceffor-s
of Columbus treated them with as much
justice as he did. we should have lived
with them in peace for ever. Thiscon
clufion may evidently be drawn from
the declaration which Columbus made
before the King of Spain. ' I swear'

is no better people in the world than

A corcefpondent who,withes neither to (latter
nor infylt government, but to deliver his senti
ments with that decent freedom which is the
prerogative of every citizen of this country, â
fays, that the Indians would be better manage i
bv treaty than bv war. At the firft fettlemeÂ»t
of this country, the provinces (as they were then)
of MafTachufetts Bay and Pennsylvania adopted,
one, the hollile, and the other, the pacific method
of dealing wit h the Indians. The experiment
was fairly tried, and the misery of the firft pro
vince was as remarkable as the prosperity of the
latter. In Maffichufetts Bay they were con
tinually harralfed with tumults and invasions.-â
The land, where many a melancholy tragedy
w s acted, was deluged with blood. The In
dians killed half of its inhabitants, and it was
once feared that they wquld extirpate every white
man from the settlement. In Pennsylvania they
knew nothing but harmony. They honestly
purchased, and peaceably took pofleflion of some
lands from the Indians, and maintained an in
celfant and friendly communication with them,
extending by degrees the settlement of the peo
ple ps the province upon the frontier. The sa
cred faying was verified, in regard to PenÂ«-
fylvania, " Bleffsd are the meek, for they {J.all
inherit the earth."âOur correspondent fays,
that the ronduÂ£l of the general government 111
regard to the southern Indians was deservedly
.applauded. The state of Georgia had palled an
att to dispose of the lands in the backpart of the
state belonging to the Indians, which they called
" vacant lands." The general government de
nied-the right to enter into the lands of the In
dians without their being purthafed or ceded ;
nr.d concluded a treaty with the Indians upon
just and humane principles. The murmurs
which were made at the expence attendant upon
this treaty were, perhaps, illiberal and improper.
It would be happy for the interefls of humanity
if the northern Indians could be managed in the
lame amicable manner with the southern. The
character of the celebrated William Penn ap
pears as great in the management of the Indians,
as it was little and mischievous in the support of
the tyrannical James the second, of England,

Reflections of a King, on his Journey tc
Cheltenham. â11 th Edition.
Tranjlatedfrom a French Paper of ORober 10.]
THIS ingenious pamphlet has had great fuc
efs in England. It offers to our view a natura
>011ra> t of the king of Great-Britain, his origi
lalturn of mind, l is whims, his faults, his opi
lions, his foibles, and his fopperies. In this verv
nterefting piece we may also discover the feerei
liftory of the court of England. The author, ir
his work, makes George the 3d his own hiftori
m, and good judges will find that the chara&ei
ia-j been humoured perfe&ly well. A bette:
â¢ pinion of the woik will, however, be formed bj
ome paflages we will take leave to quote. The
eader will call to mind the journey the kinÂ£
nade to Cheltenham (a place in England famous
or the medecinal quality of its waters) a short tim<
previous to the ditcovery of his insanity. The
uthor supposes that at this petiod a fancy ft ruck
he king to write the history of his own journey,
n the following manner he is made to speak 0
lis progenitors and himfelf tâ"During an ac
[uaintance of seventy years Handing, the houf;
if Hanover has not vet formed any tolerable ide<
if Great-Britain. My two predccefiors, botl
nen of courage and honesty, were absolute ftran
;ers in the country where they were said to go
vern ; and if they ever went out of light of theii
:aoital, it was only to gratify the very natura
lefire of feeing their dear native land. As tc
myfelf, I was from my infancy puffed up wit!
/ain notions of power and glory, aÂ»d was placec
jnder the eye of Chatham, who had more thai:
Dnce seized the reins of government from m;
grandfather, and buoyed up by the popular infa
tuation of the times, frequently insulted my youtl
and inexperience*
tl Lord Bute would have delivered me from thi
controul of Pitt, but he wanted the neceftary ta
lents, ana the conflict between them ended in
eonfufion.
** Upon my coming to the throne, the Scots,
like so many famifhed grasshoppers, flocked abou 1
me. Every source of corruption was exhauftec
to fatisfy them. It was then proposed to diftrfef:
America under pretence of a consolidation of go
vernment, but the real cause was to find place;
for the Scots* 1 was deceived. I was so weal
as to consent to ruin the colonies for the fake ol
providing offices for these importunate ones.
The one-half of my fubje&s then revolted, a!
the idea of taxes being imposed upon them with
out consent or representation. 1 was then pelted
with libels, I was hooted at, and sometimes in
sulted. At the very time I was driving all be
fore me in America, 1 hardly dared to stir out oi
my palace at home.
" Hitherto I had contented myfelf with tra
velling on a map. In this manner I journeyec
>ver Scotland in company with lord Bute, whe
lad fully depi&ed all its beauties to me. In thi;
nanner I fought fide and fide with lord George
>ackville for the conquest of America. POOI
iackville ! Both alike unpopular, we fympathi
:ed with each other. He was a much more
igreeable preceptor to me than Bute, and was
lefides an excellent soldier upon a map.â-The
mountains that bound the horizon of Windfot
lave been to me, till this hour, the confines ol
he world, and the idea of going beyond them has
;iven me not a little disquiet. I have bten
aught to consider the peasantry and artiftsas my
;reateft enemies, and indeed they have been sadly
rampled under foot in order to enrich a venal
najority in my insatiable parliaments. In what
ort of humour they are at present, and how they
vill receive me are serious questions.
<c Jenkenfon ridiculed these apprehensionsâ

illainyâhe could not pass a turnpike without a

ilan, ought to maintain from twenty to thir

That the French did not adopt some middle way
>etween defpotilm and the entire fubterfion of their
'Id government; that they did not accommodate
heir reform to the plan of the Engli/h conftitu

o difiolvc the National Afi'embly j and to get rii
it their filcal difficulties by a general bankruptcy
(receded by a war with England. These darl
ind deftrudive designs compelled the AfTembly an
he nation to go the lengths which they havegon
or their own security.
Advices from Palermo, in Sicily, mention th
leath of the monster-making prince Palagonia, i
hat city. This strange genius delighted in em
>)oying artists, not to imitate nature in her moi
aptivating forms, but in designing and executin
uch monsters as nature, however perverted, coul
lever produce. He is particularly characterize
n one of Dr. Brydone's letters, written from Pa

hirty years, a number of Iculptors and stone-cut
ers, whose extravagant and absurd production
amount to near a thousand piecesâall remarka
ble for nothing but deformity without humour :
bitds with human heads, and men with the heads
of beasts, &c. &c.âThe time has-been, when
such talents would have been held in admiration,
in various parts of the world.
