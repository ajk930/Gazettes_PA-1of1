.At a me: ting of a number of Citizens of
Per.nfylvania, at the Prince of Wale:
Tavern, May 17th, 1793, convened for
the pufpofe of taking into confederation
the late unjust and arbitrary Law , by
which a few wealthy men are incorpo
rated and empowered to v.olite t.-e
Rights and Properties of their Fellow-
Citizens, the follow ing 1< efulutions were
unanimously adopted, and di reflect to bt
P'lMiiixd mthe fcnglilh and German
Papers.â
RESOLVED.
ift. >-pHAT it is the unalienable right of
*- every citizen to be protected by tiie
government in the .ull enjoyment of hi
life and property ; and that it is the dtitj
of every legal and jult government to pro
teit such rights.
2d. That in the opinion of this meeting,
the late acts of the legiCatt're, by which
few wealthy iradivtcJi: ils are incorporated,
and empowered to violate the property of
free by digging Canals and making
Turnpike Roads, tortile private advantage
and emolument of such companies, are in
the highetl degree iuijiift a.id dangerous to
the .'.berties of tie peopleâilnjufl, becauft
these laws violently take the p.opertv of
iifeful citizens, and deliver it to wea thy
incorporated companies without the con?
fe:it of the proprietorsâand da'gerou
btcaufe these ails of incorporation emboch
the powerful and wealthy to infringe at
any time the property ot the private ci
tizens.

of the citizens is immediately aPeiled by
these private incorporated comj a ies, re

To the Freemen Â»f Pennsylvania.
Fellow-Citiitni,
THE arbitrary and usijnfl power whict
has lately been ajfumtil ly the legislature ir
combining the wealthy, a.id giving them
authority by acts of incorporation to vio
late your individual rights, d -minds your
serious attention- Such p. uceedings fhoulc
rouse yon from your dangerous letlurg).
and (hoiild engage you to form affociatiom
for the purpose of enquiring how far fuel
proceedings are founded in juflice, fount
policy, or right. The gre;.t body of yeo
nienry sire particularly in erect d in thiâ¢
inquiry, because the property of this clal"
ot citizens is devoted to become the pria
cipal object ol plunder, although the nature
of their occupation requires the tteady pro
section of government, in orcler that b)
permanent improvements, t!;eir farms 111 a)
become productive of the necefl'ary fuppori
to their families, and of bciuli.ial wealt)
to their country.
Whatever may be t'-e put- xt for invert
ing private individuals with the public higl
ways, and giving them power to viol te the
rights of their fellow citizens, the rata tire
is uimeceflary. impolitic, a ic! unjust. The
reason adduced in frpport of thclV nnwar
rantable and unprecedented laws, i , thai
they are intended for the ptblic good, ant
therefore the legillature, invelled with the
ftipreme power of the people, had arighi
to facrifice the private property of indivi
dual citizens to the neceflities of the Ita.e
if the members of the corporations in favoi
of whom such law s have been made, are
not totally devoid of honor and probity
they will theinlelves declare, that in thelt
Â«*)rojeiSs they are indicated by the forclic
motive of private emolument, and not in
fluenced by the benevolenr principle o;
public good. Whilit therefore we pity the
weakness of legislators who have futteree
themfeJves to be misled by interested men.
we contemplate with horror and i idigna
tion the artifices of those who infiuencec
the measures.
The legislature, entrufled with the so
vereign power of the people, to protecl
to procure for them all the ad
vantages of civil society. can only exereift
the authority so acquired in protesting eve
ry individual citizen in the pofleflion of hi
property, r.nd in defending his person a
gainlt violence and injury. Can tlien the
duty of protesting the property of citizens
By P. FRENEAU: Publifked Wednesdays and Saturdays, at Three Dollars annum.
confer a right at any time to violate such
property ?
In contradiction to these general and
fundamental principles of civil society, Bur
iamaque observes,* that the sovereign has
i right of making life of every thing the
fu'ojeft pofi'efles, in order toanfwerthe lie
cf the Jlale, and illuttrates his idea
of such necessity by declaring, that if a town
is to Ire fortified, lie may take the gardens,
lands or lioufes of private subjects, situated
in the place where the ramparts or ditches
ire to be railed. In sieges he may beat
down houses and trees belonging to pri
vate peifons, :Â» the end that the enemy
may not be lheltered by them, or the gar
rison incommoded. Judge Blacktlone, :i
â  onfiderable law charafler in England, and
cnnfidered in our own courts of jnflice of
tiltfirjt authority, obferves.t that the third
ahfolute right inherent in every Englfji
n.an, is that ol property, which confiits in
'he free life, enjoyment, and difpcf.il of all
nis acquisitions, without any control or di
minution, five onlv by tne 1.-uvs of the 1 ind,
wli'cli law s therefore in poiÃt of honor and
judice, are extremely watchful in afcer-
Mining and protecting this right ; :>nd
herefore, by a variety of ancient flatutes}
it is enafled, tliat 1 o man shall be difinhe-
I'rd, nor put out of his franchifes orfree
lold, unl li lie be duly brought to answer,
<nd be foi ejudged by course of law. Sc
>reat moreover is the regard of the law
or private property, that it will not an
norize the lealt violation of it, 110 not even
. >>r the general good of the whole commu
nity. Jf a new road, for instance, were to
ie made through the grounds of a private
[>erfon, it might perhaps be extensively
beneficial to the public ; but the law per
mits no man or set of men to do this with
out the consent of the owner of the land.
111 vain may it be urged that the good of
the individual ought to yield to that of the
.omnia nit v : for ir would be to
Â»ilow any private man, or even any public
tribunal to be judge of this common good
and to decide wh< ther it be expedient or
110. Belides the public good is hi nothing
more eli'entially interested, than in the pro
tection of every individual's private lights.
Not only an arbitrary afTuinption of pow
er can confer 110 right of exerulitig a des
potic power, but even the free anil united
consent of a people cannot legitimate
acts of incorporation by which posterity is
to be bound It is ablurd to fay, tli.twe
can do no injury to a people contenting to
the injury: nothing is more falfe than this
maxim. A legislature overpowered by fe
tltu .ion, may be hurried into aÂ£ts> i..jui ions
to the rights of the people, but as soon as
the wrong is discovered, it b> comes the
of tht legislature to repeal tuch laws,
not only on account of the fublfantial jui
tice due te the present generation, but tc
poflerity. A good citizen ought touanf
nut his property free to his children ; hi
cannot with jullice leave it fubjeot to tin
rapacity of a combination of wealthy men
It we ih> uldeven have the foily and mad
nil's to continue the afls of incorporation
and ourselves submit- to the situation o.
II ves, having 110 property or improvement!
In.lt we can call our own, we have 110 all
thority to render our polferity so, who wil
it anytime have a right of removing tht
ivil. It is laid that it is now too late ti
oppose the turnpike and canal companies,
It even for a moment we can flop the pro
gr'efc of inj'.iftice, or remove the oppreflior
tif | ower. it is our duty to do so. As fat
us the honor of the legislature is intereflei
111 the repeal of the laws complained of,
Â« e know that it is a maxim of de potifn
that its will ought never to be refilled, anc
that its authority ought never to recoil. I:
â¢ t not more gloriousto acknowledge an er
ror than obstinately to pel (ill in acts of in -
justice and oppreflion ? Would not the

they be thought sacred, and become pre

tinually be at the mercy of combinations
of wealthy men. For, however the laws

Mr. Editor,
n UMINATING, the other evening, over
the prominent features of the late war,
and tratiiig in my mind the steps which led
ns to independence, I arrived at the period
when the army w.u difoaiuled. 1 reflected
on the i jultice that ensued to the war
worn veteran, who had lent his services,
and the patriotic citizen who had opened
his purse to the country, upon its plighted
faith. In this part of the retrospect, cer
tain rii'ri;:ti!laixeÂ» re. urred.that harrowed
up eve y feeling of my foul. I compared
the merits of the loldicr and the citizen
creditor (I ho t ;e their forgivenefs) with
those of tin- fpecnlating swarm, who be
came (it v. ill not bear to be mentioned!)
jjoilefled of the property of the former.
Alas !" said I to myfelf, " cruel has been
the lot of the American patriots.âBase
mu i be that system w hie h robs the worthy
enrich the worthlef.,!'" Nature gave
wayâa languor pervaded my frame ; and
I funk into a dumber on my chair. I found
myfelf on the poll road, between Philadel
phia a:id N-'w-York. By the road lide,

rjAVING seen a piece in your paper,
number 161, signed HoNESTUS, it has
been deeply impreded on my mind to make
the follow ing lew observations thereupon.
1 his writer (who, in charity, I suppose
means well) cautioned lis to beware of

call in question the fmcerity of honeflu jV'
irier.riiii.p tor our government, but sure I
am that his political creed is not adapted,
to the meridian of Pennfylvimia, or suited
to the relifli of the citizen (dldiers of (776,
many ol whom are itill in ej;iltence,
look back to the days of adverlity, (U,;\
frelh in their memory) vhen America da
red to eltablilh a government pn the
of equal liberty, at a time a combination
of enemies within, and the deluded valiala
of Britain without, were actuated by all
the elements of Hell (the natural element
ol courts and despotic governments) to de
stroy infant liberty and chain lie mind of
man as well as his body in perpetual llavery.
At that awful period, the government off
France, influenced no doubt, by that uner
ring providence which dirsÂ£ls the affair.,"off
men, fteptforward to our afliilance with its
fleets and armies, and rescued our aftliGeci
cause from apparent deftruÂ£tion. Hence,
gratitude has become the principle oÂ»
affection and friendlhip in every true Ame.>
ncan bosom, that nothing but death will
extinguish ! and if thus attached ty France
while under thi despotic coritroul of a king,,
how lr.uch more so in her present ftniggje.

Should there be any Americans r hofa

Think it not strange then, hoi.eftus, jf
we manifelled the f< Ili g of <Or hearts

on the reception of Citizen GENET,- the
lirft minister from a free republic, whole
(entiineits vibrate with 01. r own, and
low 11a nrally as an ettefl from a cause.
But let us for a moment suppose,
Hmtejtus,, a royal government 10 be re
ellabnlhed in France. Its deration would
be momentary ; for the period i f ft' ap

who are of the earth, and nearly a/1 ic d tq

London, March 30. Official account?
are received from Ruilia, that the empress
is to fend ten (hips Ofthe line in to the chan
nel, as her quota againll France, on con
dition they ;;re not employed in the Metli-terrancan. Her excuse for not fending
more is, the expediency of keeping fifteen
Jhips of the line to watch the duke regent
of Sweden. She has also notified the court
of Venice, that inltead of the stipulated
quota of land force in men, (he will fend
money; being in want of all her forces to
watch the motions of the Swedes and
Turks. Hence it would seem a delign is
formed ot dismembering Sweden, and per
haps adding Constantinople to the poflefii
o;i of Rudia.
The minlltry here are about embodying s
corps of emigrants, to be sent with ai m;
Â«nd ammunition to excite infurrettions ir
Jirittanny. The French,-to prevent thi:
defpicabie plot from succeeding, have (topi
all communication with England. No En.
glilh packets are fulfered to land, but have
been ordered peremptorily away, withoul
permitting the mails to be received, or a

April i. The king of Pruflia has taker
pofleffion of Dautzic. Tile partition of Po
land is not indeed avowed, but aftualt}
carrying into execution by those power;
who have so repeatedly, solemnly and re
cently disclaimed any such intention. Thu;
while we are at war, to prevent the ag
grandizement o r France by violence anc
rapine, the very powers whose arms we
are aflifting. with whom it is poflible we
jmy be acting in concert, are openly ag
grandizing themselves by the fame injustice
and rapine, which we are fighting to pre
vent.
The month of March has been a month
of carnage. In the course of it, 30,00 c
human creatures h.ive been swept by vio
lence from the face of the earth; but a:
they perilhed by the fortune of war, the
accounts of the conflicts in which they fell
of the plains covered by the dead, or o:
the hospitals crowded with the dying, o;
the air infeited by the {tench of maTmec
and mutilated bodies, and pntr fyinj

donate without horror, and by the mof
delicate without difgnft '.
April 4. Yefterdjy some difpatche:
were received at lord Grenville's oflke
Whitehall, from Oftend, which were feni
off to his majfty at VVi.idfor Lodge. Tht
French forces, it now appears, have whol

By a gentleman who was at Bruflels or

when the French army entered that city
after the battle with the Auftrians, he wai
witness to a scene tnat was shocking to b<

S i R,
Permit me to offer for your acceptanci
the gratulations of a heart devoted to yoni
caufe,on your arrival among us,& my bet
wilhes that the objeÂ£t of your miflioii maj
beaccj n,j!i hid in its fulled latitude,aod tha
everybenignantfpiritmayfmile propitious tip
on every private as wellas public endeavour
In these jovs and these wilhes, I will can
didiv co lfefs I am not wholly free fron
felt interest; for I consider your appear
ance among us, from the effects which hav<
already appeared, as the fabled bafililk giv.
jng death to an ariltocratic hydra by tht
mere coup d'oeil. Great were the effort!
to communicate to the people the insensi
bility to your cause which hung in icicle;
around the hearts of a certain defcriptior
of men among us; but the feelings of a
virtuous gratitude were not to be oblitera
ted by the laboured artifices of the enemie;
to equality: the people of America w ereftil
animated with the quickening principle ol
liberty, if it would exp<#id itfelf when a
proper object offered for its embrace.
Such, fir, have you appeared to them, anc
you have already interested their affeflion;
as much as if you were the pedestal ol
their happiness. The frozen maxims o)
courtiers have not yet chilled the honefl
sentiments of the enlightened citizens of the
United States; they have rejected with
ftorn the attempts to engraft upon their
natioual character, a stigma more oppro
brious than pnnic faith; under these impres
sions well might they rejoice on your arri
val, well might they hail you as the wel
come raeflenger of their affections. Ame
rica is indebted to France for her prefenl
portion of liberty ; nay more, (he must
look up to her for its prcfervation ; for so
incorporate is their fate that they mud rife
or set together. If the oak is prostrated
by the blast, the ivy which has entwined
itfelf around it, mult participate in the ru
in. Should France be fubjugatc-d by the
confederated tyrants, woe unto Americaâ
for if a direst attack should uot be made by
them upon her liberties, the feduitive
power of corruption may make them pass
away like a meteor. There can be doubt
to any one -cnverlant in the affairs of this
couiyry, that we have characters among
us who wilh to abridge the freedom of the
people, to fw ell their own importance.â
Should therefore the intrigues of Europe
an monarchs, and the persuasion of their
gold be added to the influence and intima
tions of those characters, it would require
a sterner virtue than we appear to pcflefs
to guard us against the evil. But if we are
allowed to reason from what we know,
the flow operation ol poison will not be
used, when the stiletto can be employed
with more speedy effect. Thp motive
which produced a combination against
France inuft operate to our deflrutiion ;
for as long as liberty has a lurking place,
tyrants will hunt it outâfor as long as it
has a being, they hold their sceptres with
a trembling hand. Should, alas! France
be the victim of tyranny, America will
not have a friend on whom (he can cast
herfelf for protection ; she will have no
Ihield but her own virtue, no llrength but
her own arm to ward off the merciless
blow of despotism. Thefa reflections juf
tify me in repeating, 'hat the United States
mutt look up to France for the perpetration
ot her liberty.
In another view, Sir, I felicitate my
country on your arrival among usâFalse
reasonings upon things have begotten a
difpolition for distinCtion, and some who
were exalted to be the representatives of
the I'overeignty of the people, began to be
lieve thatthey weretiieSovereign them
lelves. The gorgeous trappings of inonar
chy have been substituted tor dignified re
publican simplicity, and to be an officer of
government already con ituted a separate
privilege; for altho' the title of nobility
was not annexed to it, the exclusive privi
lege which it gave, inllituted a rank above
the people. Vou, fir, appear not only to
have laid alide thc jemblauce of superiority
but to wilh no other reality but what
republican virtue and fimpl.city btftows,and
a zealous interest and exertion in the
:aule of your country inspire. As example
is more powerful! than precept, in this
way you will be a powerful auxiliaary in
the caufeof equality.
A dangerous fupinenefs had already in
feCteo us, when the flame of liberty was
efk'Chd from your republic and rewarm
ed us with its heat. The citizens ol
America hac almost forgotten that freemer
Fhould be l,k velfal , keep pious and un
healing vigiU o.tr the sacred lamp of li
erty ; but ti:ey have started from tlieii
[lumbers, and scent the refreshing gales ol
re dom. How great are our obligation:
to the French nation 1
Although internal as -well as externa!
cnemiei, seek to deltroy yoUr country, ]
trull the fair plant of liberty will be che
rished by the hand of heaven, and that it
will bloom and c'iffufe its fragrance through
the world in spite of opposing tyrants.

PHILADELPHIA.
Saturday, May 2j.
On Saturday last a republican dinner vvai
given at Oellers's Hotel to citizen Genet
by a refpeftable number of French, anc
French Ameiican citizens. The miniUei
and his family were present, also citizen:
Ternant and Laforet, the latter of whon
presided, the captain and oHcers of. the
frigate l'Ambufcade, &c. The compan)
confided of about 100 citizens, met in thi:
convivial manner to welcome the firft citi
zen minirter of the only European elective
Government. After dinner a number ol
patriotic and republican toaits were drank
of which the following is a translation.
i. "Liberty and equality. 2. The French
republic. 3. The United States. 4. The
National Convention. 5. The Congref:
of the United States. 6. The ftatc of Penn
sylvania and the city of Philadelphia. 7.
The valiant defenders of French liberty bj
(ea and land. 8. The memory of thole
heroes who have fallen in the cause of A
n erican Independence. 9. The virtuous
Wafliington : May Heaven grant to France
and to the United States many citizens that
referable him. 10. Union and perpetual
fraternity between the people of Brance
an-H tne United States. 11. The arm of a
Hercules to those who combat the hydra
of despotism. 12 May the next generation
know despotism from history only. 14. The
ye?rs 1776 and 1792. jj. May all heads
i'oon be under one cap, that of liberty.â
After the third toast, an elegant ode (fee
second page of this paper) suited to the oc
casion, and compoled by citizen Pichon.
a young Frenchman of promiiing abilities,
was read by citizen Du Ponceau, and uni
versally applauded. The society, cn mo
tion, ordered that citizen Freneau Ihould
be requested to translate it into Englilh
verfff, and that the original and translation
fliouldbepublifhed, The society also unan
imOusly voted that citizen Fiction (hould be
recommended to the notice ofthe minirter.
After a short interval the Marfeilleije
hymn was sung, :it therequeft ofthe socie
ty by c.tizen BotirnonVille, with great tafie
and spirit; the whole company joined in
the chorus. Two additions ftanzes
composed by citizen Genet, and suited to
the navy of France, werethen called for,
sung, and encored.=âlt should be mention
ed, that previous to the lingingof this ani
mating hymn, a deputation from the fuilurs
of the frigate LMmbufcade made their ap
pearance, were received with cordial em
braces, and took their feats among their
fellow citizens. Citizen Genet, at the
request of the society, gave them a fjng
replete with truly patriotic and republican
lentiments, and well adapted to the occa
lion, which he sung with great energy and
judgment. (The original and translation
ofthis song will be given in a future paper)
The table was decorated with the tree
and cap of liberty, and the French and A
merican flags. Thelaft toast being drank
the cap of liberty was placed 011 the head
of citizen Genet, and then travelled from
head to head round the table, each wear
er enlivening the scene with a patriotic
entiment. These tokens of liberty, and
American and French fraternity, were de
livered to the officers and mariners of the
frigate L'Ambufcade, who proniifed to
defend them till death. The company
*.hen left the hotel, at an early hour in the
Evening, and accompanied citizen Genet
to the city tavern . amidst the acclamations
of a very large concourfa of citizens, whose
repeated huzzas were answered by shouts
of, God Jane the United States !â(During
the entertainment a volunteer toast was
given â¢'Liberty and success to the Dutch
patriots."âwith the following lines by a
patriot of that nation in this city ;
Geuereux freres de la repnblique
Amis des Bataves patriotiqoes,
La Patrie nous eft toujours chere,
Ecrafez nos traitres par le feu et ie fer ;
Donntz nous un Washington par
terre ;
Nous te rendrons un De Ruiter fur la
mer !â]
Extract of a letter from Mason county,
Kentucky, April 7. 1793.
'â  Within this month past there have been
[our companies defeated, in the wilderness
and about thirty people killed, amongit
whom tlie post-rider unfortunately tell,
the Indiansrfeem disposed tor war on all
our frontiersâa ftaiion was on the night
ofthe firft inft. attacked by a large number
of favages,and burnt to ait.es, eighteen per-
I'ons taken in all, including women and
children, besides three killed 011 the spot."
It is worthy of observation. that those
persons who vindicate the Britifli nation in
commencing ar againll France, are qui
etly for J'ubmitUng to have the Englilh
hold our frontier, contrary to express trea
ty. Whereas the only plausible plea for
England is that "the government of France
hive violated exiftmg treaties, by attempt
ing to deprive the United Provinces of
Holland, of the exclusive navigation of the
Scheldt." If this isa jttft cuofe of war on
the part of England, what can be said to
our fuffering the Englilh to violate exilling
treaties between the United States, in
holding our frontier posts ? If England can
be jultified by the e persons, in going
to war with France, for violating this trea
ty, how can these fame persons oppose our
demajidin.g an immediate surrender of
those posts, agreeable to "an existing trea
ty?"âlf war is jutt on one fide, for the
fulfillment of treaties, surely a demand on
the other niuft be much more reafona
blcl [Independent Chron. ]
Mere vague reports of French diftre
French defeats, counter-revolution?, &c.
may answer in England, but in America
we havce such recent proofs of the measures
taken by the Britifli ministry, and their e
miflaries, to propagate,fallhoods, that they
are viewed here as the lalt effort of a weak,
?xpiring oppolition. We know that Mein
and Fleming, Draper, Rivington. &c. were
Employed to print every kind of abnfe a
iainft our revolution; but their weekly
publications were known to be the ebulli
tions oftorics, headed by their noted cham
pion Maffachufettenfis. At that time these
paragraphs were retailed in the court
prints in England, as the real state of affairs
in America. The fracas between Mein,
and our late worthy patriot Capt. Dafh
cvood, it is probable was at the time, held
forth in their prints, as the formidable ren
counter of a body of counter rcvolution
ifts. Mein, it is true, got wounded in the
head, but whether the " lower part of his
belly" was injured in this engigment, is
not'thoroughly ascertained ; though it
thought that Venus was more formidable
than Mars as to his personal complaint or
danger.
It is our misfortune' to have among us
now, the fame kind of persons as when we
were at war with the Britilh. They are
actuated by the fame unfriendly principle?;
they are enemies of liberty, and ever wish
to fruftrate all measures that tend to esta
blish it. These people can always find
printers for their pnrpofe, and the venal
press under their patronage, i; constantly
idling its mifreprefent:.tions and falihoods.
But the virtuous 'American u ho feels for
the rights and liberties of mankind ; whois not led by the paltry motives of quarter
ly payments ; b.tnfc scrip, &c. cannot bur
implore the blessings of Heaven 0:1 the ef
forts of a natiun, in their ftruggtes against
the tyr mts of Europe, who have leagued
to annihilate every vestige of freedom
and the rights offociety from the face ot
ill? earth. America will soon becomt
the object of these defpbts; and as we re
gard our own liberty, a id the peace, fate
ty and independence of our country, it is
our duty earnetfly to pray for the success oi
France. [ludepend. Chrou. J

The report of the American Ai..baf

Since our last, an extract of a letter,
said to be from New-York, has been pub
lished in the daily papers of this city. The
intelligence it conveys is affested to have
come in a veliel from Caiais to New-Lon
don in 27 daysâ'â¢ That Gen. Dumourier,
on the 6th of April, by an atlonilhing ma
ittuvre, surrounded ten thoutfand of the
dower of the Prullian army, and cut them
to pieces to a man ; the king of Prufia and
.he duke of Brunfwick, among the (lain."
None of the last New-York or Eastern pa
pers mentioning a word in confirmation ot
rh's news, it may be concluded to be wit'h
utfc-jndation. From what intelligence
las this week come to hand ; from other
[Uarters, it appears too certain that
Jumourier had quitted his army, and goue
nver to the combined powers. That the
I'oldiers, however, remained firm to the
lational cause, not a man having quit his
tandards, We forbear adding any conjec
.nresonthe causes that may have induced

The English government, jealous of fee
ing the m iferable Irilh leaving their land
as (lavery, for the more eligible forefts o:
America, has put a stop to the emigratior
of redeniptioners, more particularly from
the North of Ireland. None, therefore,
but persons of properly, who may be able
to advance the paftage money for them -
selves and families, can attempt coining tc
the United States ; and even those find an
almost insurmountable difficulty, in difpo
ling of their property : so that the people
ot Ireland seem to be in a manner com
pletely imprisoned, and obliged to remain
under their present yoke.
This, however, they do not so much
.omplain of, as that of being difarnied.

A writer in the General Advertiser o!
Thursday, who signs bimfelf A Citizen,
makes the following reflections on the late
conduct of some Britifli sailors in this ciity :
â" It would not in the lead surprize me
f fotne of the English sailors in this city
lionkl lose their lives, on account of their
â  it - ;:;" and ill treatment to French fai
ors. The evening before last, a French
"ailor was walking peaceably along Front
Ireet, and was unprovokedly knocked
â town by four F.ngliih sailors who were
jrovid d with clttbs for that purpose. Had
it not been for the timely i.iterpofitibn oi
"ome citizens, he would either have beer
killed or maimed, as they vowed a horrid
vengeance upon every " Dâd fcoundrt
who wore a National Cockade."
Unless some steps are taken by govern
nent to afford protection to our friends
the French, I am apprehensive serious
will enCue; for either the
Freiuh will revenge thernfelvts, or their
friends among us will take lignal vengeance
011 such infamous banditti. We are no
longer under a Britiih tyranny, where
quiet people are at the mercy of their sa
vage crew, but an independent republic,
that mull feel itfelf insulted by every such
daring outrage upon its laws.âThis is the
fecoud instance of ill treatment to the
French sailors that has fallen within my
own knowledge, and I hope such steps will
be taken as to make it the last. I never
met with more peaceable men than the
French sailors in this city, and I am con
vinced no diflurbance would ever happen
â vere it not For the fwaggeriug insolence
and brutality of the Britiih tars."

L 1 ranjlated fm 7 a St. Dimingo Paper
of April 9. j
jj HE shores of the river Acheron were
JL lately covered with animmenfe nam
her or dead, who asked a pafTage across ;
and Charon, fatigued with labour, was by
n o means in a good humour with his pas
fengers. Every one would go over firft,
and the boatman, to avoid giving um
brage, determined to (hew a preference
to merit only.âAn old grenadier firft ap
peared, and infilled on pafiing over im
mediately, because he loft his life Jn the
attack on the I3adile. This circumdance
gained him indant admiflion. Defiilles
related the aTair at Nanci, and Charon re
ceived him and it will be readily
conje&med that the vidtims of the 10th ol
Aliguft, were not mortified with a refu
fal. While Chiron was receiving all these
brave fellows on board, he ob'erved a fat
man, fhnrter by the head at least than the
others, who looked very four ai the recit*.'
of the actions ofthofe who had firll pas
fed. As there now remained to be car
ried over only a few priests and macaro
iii's, Charon gave him leave to step ir
without further examination, and withou
knowing hirr. D'.ring the passage hi
enquired, but could not learn whether hi
had been a citizen, a pried, or a noble
man. He ghod feeing Charon mucf
embarrassed, thus addressed him, in a me
jancholv tone of voice. " Yon seem anxi
oils to l.rtw who I amâleirn then, thai
in times pad I have made laws, and af
ter-/ :'ds caused them to be executed, bui
v. s at lad executed myfelf."
How! (said Charon) was you the la'i
king of the French ? GhoflâUndoubt
edlyâ and facrificed to a faction of whoir
my dear relation is the head. Charon â
Say rather, that you fell a facriHce to youi
own treaclmy and the intri ues of youi
brothers ; for, why were y >u not ttue ti
the oath you took, when you c epte j the
constitution ? Why was the civil lilt reve
rue expended at Coblentz and at fevera!
other places, and indeed wherever the re
bels could be found, who were all nobleif
and your friends, notwithftandiug the cor.-
ftitution you had f\v f to maintain? Gh j
âI always bore an excellent charadter; ]
thought my people had need o' being go
kerned, not having capacity to goverr
themselves. I saw a great number of mi
dear filer,ds in Germany, who were daily
riflting their lives in my service. I couk
not otherwise thart make them fomecom
pens tion, and the civil lift revenue wa;
all 1 could get at for the purpose. Thii
was all I had to offer them. In my fitua
tion, every man would have done th(
fame thing. My only concern now is
tlsat my people are not happy, and wil
not recognize my good intentions.
CharonâRather be concerned for your
felf and those of your description on earth,
You are soon to appear at the judgmeni
feat of Minos, that inexorable judge, whe
has no more partiality for kings than foi
the meansft qf the people. GhojiâWhat
do you suppose then that Minos is com
miflioned with power to judge one of thi
mod powerfrll monavi is th :t ever lived 01
earth ? CharpnâHow !do you who havi
butjud quitted the â¢ o-intry of liberty anc
equality, you who are nothing but dud anc
athes, do you dill retain the pride of youi
former court, and the insolent spirit ol
your brother rovalids ? Lay aside such
impudence, which will not be borne with
at the bar of Min-s, and please to recoiled
that Fortune in placing you for a moment
at the he:id of a great empire, did not
theieby dedroy, and never will dedrov that
(ird law of nature, Equality. Ghojtâ
Dues Minos make use of Letttes de cachet r
Chiron âWhat do you mean by that v ord:
Qhojl âIt is a mod convenient contrivance
to extend the power of the sovereign
snd shut-up the mou'hs of those who are
bold enough to publish the weaknefTes of
great men. By means of a Lettre de ca
chet a prince can (hut up forever from so
ciety any of his fubjefts that are so unfor
tunate as to offend him. Charonâln this
country we have a mi:ch more equitable
law, the law of retaliation (here the dead
roan gave a dismal grin : Charon then set
him ashore, bidding him be of good cou
rage, firft ffeing him to pay his passage.
The ghost gave h'm an affignat, or nation
alncte) CharonâHah! what is this ? do
you think I am to be put off with the fc; ap
of an old balla- ? GhojlâWhy, this ir,
god, fait paper money, such aa circulates
through my whole kingdom. Charonâ
How can it be that France, reputed so
fine a country, so rich, and it? people so
industrious ; how is it poflible that (he can
pay tier debts with ft'.ch paper rags as this!
GhojiâFrance has been compelled to it,
ever since my wife ( Antoinette)to indulge
her whims and affiit her family, engrofled
all the coin in the kingdom. Chiron â
W.i it a let of devils! a tine famdy indeed !
Come ! you mufl fir;d some way to pay me
in hard money. Ghofi âI; is impoflibleâ
hut Hopâl have a little gold box contain
ing the relics of the blcfied St. Labre. It
was given me by my con efTor, but I mall
now make life of it to pay my pafiage.
[Here the boatman took the box, threw
the reliques upon the ground, and shewing
Louis Capet the road, wilhed him a plea

PHILADELPHIA, May 25.
M. Mangourit, French Couful al
Char'eft'm, gave public notice in tlx
Charlcfton pap-rs of April 30, that from
the repeated insults offered to the Frencl
citizens in that place by the Engiifh fai
lors, they 1 have resolved to walk no long
er thro' the flreets of that city, without
proper weapons to chastise the irrfults o
the Britifli ruffians.
( From the Ch.rlejlon City Gazette. )
" IT is roundly afleited, that becauft
the French are allowed to fit out privateer
from this port, in orderto cruile againll
their enemies, that we Hull be involved ir
a war, and with whom ? With Great-Bri
lain I Fir ft let me a(k what are the French
to us ? Allies by the bonds of mutual
friendftiip and congenial (entimentâwhal
are the British to us as a nation ? Nothing.
hut to some indivi u i's, alt in all. With
the French nation v-e have a treaty of al
liance foaled with the blood of each party;
a treaty which they made with us when
we wc r e diltreffed by Britain, an I by
ivhich we completed the work of our in
Impendence ; gratitude therefore, without
111 i 9 rreaty, vould compel every Amen
an to love the F er h ration, and to pre
fer their fiendlhip etore all others. I
lave foinewhat digrefi'cd, therefore to re
turn to the dreadful appi-hinfions -
" Privateers are not only si tid out ol
his port, but Americans are conccrnec
1 herein 1 hence it will follow that Great
Britain will consider it as a commence
ment of hollilities, and will avenge the
insult by declaring war against America."
riuch are the appreheniions of some, who
[her fore have thought it requifhe to cal!
the ciiiz' ns together, to take necessary
(teps for th salvation of poor America.â
Now, firs, we will admit it to be a fad,
that the privateer, Citizen Genet, is part
ly owned by Americans, nay, that hei
crew is partly Americans. Is not hei
captain French ? Is she not commiffionec
by the F ench Republic? Wi 1 (he not
light and capture prizes under the nationa
flag? Surely not e will deny this, and the
r i of its being so ; but because I, whe
am an American, chufe' to attach myfeil
to the French, and they have made war
against England, mull it follow that all
America is liable to answer for me as an
individual? Did this Bate, or the gover
nor thereof, fit out in a public manner,
and with a declared refolntion, privateer:
to cruise against the Britilh, it might in
volve the (late, but in my opinion, not the
Union, while they disavowed it. Pray,
Messrs. Printers, what will become of rt
nerica (hould her sons, who are now in the
armies of the F ench Republic, step ove;
the channel with Gen. Dumourier and in
vadeEngland; will the almighty parliament
of G. Britain declare war againll America,
! >ecaufe 1 or 200 of her sons have joined the
jovial fetwhoare hunting down heieditary
lefpotifm and tyranny throughout Europe:
I fancy not, therefore little,. pprehenfiom
can be held by America of an evil which
may ensue, to disturb her internal peace ir
consequence ofprivateershaving been fitted
out of this port by the Frenchâbesides,
have we not seen the.fame done in every
war. I will not apply to the war Ameri
ca had with England, for some American;
(at least they were born in America]
were in the Britilh army, and a few nativt
Britons were in the American service ;
but have not instances been known, thai
even when Enpland has been at war with
France, that the latter have received sup
plies from the foimer: and are there not
Englifl), Scotch & IrisH continually in the
armies of France ? Can it be hindered or
avoided ? No, not even by the despotism
or that barbarous tyrant of the north.
Man by nature is f.ce, and he will be lo
whenever he chufes to exert or afiume
Ins right. lam free to enter into any
ervice, or become a citizen of any nation
Wiio w.ll receive me. If the French re
public fit out privateers in this port, they
Â° no more than by treaty they have a
J >ght ; and this right the governor of no
lute in the union can either lessen or
take away and if on fitting out a private
vefFtl of war, Americans fiiou.d enter
on board, yet while {he is commissioned
y the French republic, (he is boncjidt
f rcnch, and the law of retaliation can nc
farther operate, on the fide of Great Bri
tain, i han as (lie can life it againlt Fraiict
ilireiStly. And however that in any enp
lures which England may mak,e of the re
public s private ships, orany other, of war,
iome of the crew, nay, some of the officer:
may happen to becitizens of America,it car
only affect them individually End not then
country ; and that, during the contest be
tween those two powers, this will fre
quently be the cafe, can admit of little
doubt. All the rclt refpefting the fit
ting out, See. in our ports, is done by trea
ty, which I truil no poweron earth willoi
can ever induce S. to violate."

I Have claims to about two hundred am
fifty thousand acres of LAND in the state 01
K.entuckey, in different parts of that country
ome of which I know to be equal to any ; al
wheh I am inclined to dispose of, either bi
â¢ntire sale, or by admitting one, or two partners
:o whom the agency on the whole will be com
mitted.
One fourth of the contra# will be required ir;
iand, either in cash, merchandise, or such affei:
is may be converted to a&ive ufc, the re/idu<
nay be apportioned in convenient instalments,
The purchasers to give security, on the land]

Knowing that there is a prejudice against th<

han just, J am willing to stipulate in the con
"ra.<fl, that a discount, or deduction, Ihall be
nade, where any land may be loft, by reason ef i

Any person inclining to such a purchase, is re
