ON THE IN JUS TIC E
Of THE
EXCISE LAW
AND THE
SECRETARY'S REPORT.
r T"'HAT the Excise Law has a tenden
X dency to contravene the princi
ples of liberty, to deprave the morals o
the citizens who live by farming ; anc
that it injures industry and interfere:
with the business of distilling, I pre
fume the scope of this investigation ha:
abundantly proved. That it will ra
quire a veftiture of powers, and an ex
ertion of force, arbitrary reftrittions
and excessive penalties, to give effe& tc
the operation of the law, experience
has already evinced to the candid anc
disinterested, and mud be impreflec
even on the mind of the inflexible Fi
nancier, and the whole tribe of his de
pendants, by the future progress of the
system.
To proVe that the excise is unjust.
impolitic, and contrary to the design ol
the constitution, is the object which 1
shall now attempt ; and, I am persuad
ed, that to demonstrate how inequitable
and partially oppressive it is, I shall on
ly have the trouble of applying the fadli
which I have already stated.
The produce of the foil in all the old
settlements, and especially in the east
ern states, (except in fomeplaces a small
quantity of brandy) is free from excif
esi; and this immunity extends to all
the manufactures of the foil. Rum
made from molafles that is imported
"from the Welt" 111 dies, an excise
of ten cents per gallon, on the lowefl
proof, and fells, by wholesale, in this
city, where much of it is stilled, at the
calh price of 5s per gallon ; the demand
for it is so extensive, and the consump
tion so great, that the manufacturer is
able to incorporate the payment of the
excise with the charge, upon the consu
mer, notwithstanding theprefent adven
titious scarcity and high price of molas
ses in the islands. Whisky, however,
is wholly extratted from grain, which
is both railed and diltilled by the farm
er ; it is prepared in situations remote
from the market, and it makes a part ol
the tubfiftence, not only as a substitute
for other ardent spirits, but also for cy
der and beer, for these rarely exist where
whisky is mod generally manufactured.
I have already {fated that it is also used
as an article of barter, as a kind of cir
culating medium or substitute for mo
ney, for where it abounds, money i:
exceedingly scarce, though even there
rum will procure it.âBut I shall for
bear to recapitulate, and will refer the
reader to the statements I have already
made on this subject. I will here ad
mit the calh price of whisky to be 3s.
or 40 cents, at the place of diftillatior
(tho' I cannot lupport the
anexcife, at eight centspergallon, woulc
be rating the whisky at one-fifth of it:
price. Without claiming therefore
though I justly might, a preference ir
favour of whisky, as it is drawn from the
produce of the foil, and as not beinj
generally a cash article ; but putting the
two kinds of fjjirit on terms of per :
feet equality, when the whisky pays the
proposed tax of 8 cents, the rum oughl
to pay about 13, ellimating the rum al
the present calh price in Philadelphia,
â¢viz ss. or 66 2-3 cents, so that there is
3 bounty of three cents per gallon in fa
vour of rum: is not this going far tc
give it a monopoly in the market ? Bui
I will state the companion still more
favorably for the rum, and admit that it
fells at 4/6 or 60 cents, and the differ
ence in its favor will be one-sixth of the
excise, which is more than one and one-
Jialf cents of a bounty ; but admitting,
what I am lure is not true, that the com
mon felling price of whisky is raised to
56 cents, and tiding the rum at 5/3, or

â jo ccnts, which was the actual whole
sale price since the petitions for a revi
fion of the excise law were laid befon
Congress, and the rate of excise is equal,
viz. one-lev'enth on each.
How deeply engaged to serve a parti
cular interest mull the secretary hav
been, and how hard pulhed to find tin
means of doing it, when he committer
his reputation so far, as to state, for
fact, what he hÂ»d not vouchers to sup
port ; âthe most favorable conftruci,
on I can put upon his conduct, is, tha
he has fuffered himfelf to be impoib<
upon by lomc whose interest it was t<
deceive him. Upon a careful enquin-
I have found one house which hat!
purchased some choice whisky brougk
into the city, at gl/9 or 50 cents, an<
that solitary instance is the only one ,
can find ; how could he then in his re
port state, that the common rate, when
it was in grcateft abundance, diftillcc
and excised, was 56 cents, or 4_/i
gallon? Even if he had designed to im
pose on Congress the price of a choic<
quantity hauled into Philadelphia, whicl
is a very falfe rule, yet even that doe?
not appear to be true. Even though ii
has been rendered scarce by so many
farmers ceasing to diftill, and tho' sub
ject to the cxcife, it is now fold even in
aid settlements, within seventy or eigh
ty miles of the market, in small quanti
ties, at 2/9 a gallon.
I will make another comparative
statement nearer the truth than any ol
the former. I will suppose whisky at 2/6
or 33 cents, and it has more frequent
ly been fold below than above that price
when*, it abounds most. and where
excise must be paid ; and I will estimate
rum at 4/10, or almost 65 cents ; on this
estimate it would pay towards the ex
cise two thirteenth parts of the calh
price, and the whilky would pay almost
â¡ne fourth ; consequently, the owner of
whisky would, on the sale of 100 gal
lons, receive 121. 1 of. and pay to gov
ernment 31. and the owner of rum, on
the sale of 100 gallons, would receive
241. 3/4, and would pay to government
31. Igf or the rum would almost pay
3/9 on the pound, and the whisky near
4/5, consequently there is a bounty still
of near 3 cents to the gallon in favour
of rum, but I will admit it to be but 2-f,
and the amountof preference, in gohhds.
would amount to 137! dollars, and it is
fold in such, or perhaps much larger
quantities at one sale ; but who ever
saw forty or fifty hhds. of whisky fold
at once ; the owner of that despised li
quor must wait long, in most places, and
have good fortune if he gets money at
all. The partiality of this measure in
favor of the distiller of rum, and the op
preflion of the farmer, is too evident to
need a comment : if this is justice, that
cardinal virtue must Have changed its
nature and degenerated into corrup
tion.
I have said, the whisky does not
spread the fail of commerce, and that it
is not in demand in the feats of elegance
and wealth. I would not however be
understood to mean, that there were no
instances of its being carried abroad, or
drank in the capital of America. Pro
bably some of it may have been trans
ported to the Weft Indies as a curiosity;
and I have said, I believe that some
choice samples of it are used here in the
houses of the opulent as a rarity; but
this occurs upon the fame principle that
yams from the Weft Indies are exhib
ited, with other exotic dainties, on the
tables of Philadelphia, not because we
esteem themequal toourown vegetables,
but because they are a novelty.
I have not brought brandies distilled
from fruit into the comparison ; because
they are made in small quantities, and
are rarely, if at all, to be met with ve
ry far from market. Peaches make an
excellent spirit, which can command a
price both from its goounefs and its rar
ity ; but thf fruit must be gathered in
the busy season of the year ; and peact
orchards, from their hasty decay, thei
uncertain bearing, efpccially in lime
Hone lands, and their being much or
the decline throughout the country
would rather call for a bounty to encou
rage the diltillery of spirit from theii
fruit, than juftify the impofttion of at:
oppreflive tax. Although apples ma)
be chiefly made into cyder or prefervet
for food, yet there is a certain propor
tion of them that is fit for no other uff
than making spirit ; but I have alway;
underltcod that the labor and expenct
of preparing it was nearly equal to the
profit.
The injuiliee and oppreflion of th(
excise are ftili more evident, wher
we take into view the relative fituatior
of those pe: sons who are concerned ir
it. There are more than 100,000 in
habitants of Pennsylvania, nay, I fup
pole that I may fafely alledge that one
fourth of the people contained in the
Rate, which extends to the Alleghany
and Ohio waters, (and in a short time
of peace the proportion will be greater)
who have neither beer nor cyder ; and
consequently to them it is an excise up
on those liquors, upou every restorative
or exhilarating draught, or,ifyoupleafe,
upon every liquid that will intoxicate.
The Secretary (who too frequently pro
claims his ignorance on this fubjeft,
when he would be thought to express
the most accurate information) whilst
dictating to the legillature of the molt
extended and various empire that ever
was governed on the principles of re
presentation, takes his data for internal
taxation from as limite l a scale of in
formation, ob If he was reporting upon
the finances of the little republic of Ge
neva, or the canton of Bern. In the fir ft
age of new settlements, whilst they have
their land to clear and their buildings
to raise, which require the ex
ertions of bodily strength ; (and it is
well known that persons, while enga
ged in those exertions, can consume,
with a salutary effett, much larger quan
tities of spirits, than people otherwif:
employed can do without danger of in
toxication) I fay, while such labor is to
be performed, and not a draught even
of cyder is to be procured to save the
whilky,the secretary's 16 gallon average
is, to luch laborers, a short allowance
indeed. The new settler firft raises his
buildings with the affiftanceof hisneigh
bours, inthecabbinform, with clapboard
roofs : and, as he is able, proceeds to
clear his land ; in doing which he dea
dens or girdles the large timber ; so that
in the western country, where timber
greatly abounds, and is exceedingly lof
ty, what is called a new field, is in fafl
a towering foreftof dead trees, the very
roots of which take up a great portion of
the foil. After the firft period of a
few years, in which only the smaller
limbs of the trees fall, the settlers have
annually to procure the afTiftance of
their neighbors, to roil the logs in heaps
for burning: and thus 1 have fcen a
field, containing perhaps little more
than 10 acres, for the cutting, rolling
and burning the logs with which it was
covered, the Secretary's 16 gallons
would certainly be no unreafonabie re
frefhment. There are yet but few
shingle roofed buildings within 100
miles of the extreme fettled parts of
Pennsylvania. I once attended the rai
sing of a barn and I found that 2 men
were employed on each corner, until it
became so high, that ropes were neces
sary, when three men were required.
This process, therefore, demands from
16 to 24 on the corners : and to felcft
the timber, diredt the business, carry
and push up the logs, a number of work
men from 30 to 40 will be pretty labo
riously employed. The raising of a
double barn or a good house will occu
py two days. I cannot then suppose,
that during such exertions, andexpofed
to the fcorehing fun, the allowance of
Numb. 56.
a pint of common day, to
each man, can be deemed extravagant
and, consequently, I conclude that the
Secretary need be under no apprehen
tonsofdrunkennefs. eventho' the family
hould consume more than his 16 gallons
it a raiiingwhich continues two days ;
ind certainly some rcfrernment was ne
.effary and proper at the time of felling,
lewing, and hauling the timber. The
number of hands at a raifmg may vary
according to the size of the timber. A
larmer, with whom I once lodged, in
formed me that he had jud corne from
the thirty firft rolling at which he had
affided that spring, and I think that the
Secretary himfelf might very civilly and
fafely have drank one fourth of the six
teen gallons average, during so conficler
ible a period, at so fatiguing a service.
[ have not brought reaping and mow
ing into the account, because the far-
Tiers in the old settlements likewise
:onfume fpiritson those occasions, but
with a greater abatement if they have
:yder.
I repeat, that I (hould be ashamed of
detailing this fubjeft so minutely, were
t not rendered necedary by the igr.o->
ance of circuindances, and mifreprefen
ation of faÂ£b, that are applied by others
o their shame and compunction, to supâ
sort injudice. But it mud not here be
orgotten, that the people rcfiding 011
he western waters, have no other pofii
)le method of reducing their grain to a
jortable form, by which they can be
mabled to bring it to market, of to im
prove it as an article of barter, fupply
ng the place of money in paying for
or labour. The fair and candi d
:iy}clvifion therefore, is, that the exif
:ing excltc taw" has, Irin. >- - 5-â
proportion of the citizens, the faitie C>~
peration, as if a rate of excise, equal to
sne fourth or one fifth, of the value,
ivere laid upon beer orcyder, consumed
iy the farmer, or upon the flour, tobac
;o, rice, indigo, pot-ath, horses, lum
ber, onions, &c. exported.
If thefefafts be true, and the infer
ence which I have drawn be just, there
lever was, in any country, under any form
jf government, a more partial, opprel
five, and unjust inftrur.ient of revenue.
The constitution of the UnitedStatej,
with a delign to afford security againlt
partial combinations and undue influ
ence in the legiilature, has declared
that direct taxes fliall be levied, equal
ly, throughout the territory of the union:
but by the construction given to tb.it
claule, in support of the excise law, it
has been rendered (instead of a reduc
tion calculated to maintain the equal
rights of the members of the confedera
tion, and to restrain the hand of pow
er by the honorable limitation of equi
ty and impartiality) an instrument of
opprefiion and injustice ; at the fame
moment blading the fair prospect of
that freedom, which the triumphs of a
ten years war pictured to our hopes ;
demming the wholesome current of do
medic indudry, and prostrating. forthe
purposes of an inlidions and fordid poli
cy, the genuine and only permanent
props of a republican government, pub
lic confidence, and private virtue. Re
garded in the light in which I have
fairly placed it, the fame principles will
apply as properly to raise an cxcife of
one fourth or one fifth upon the indigo
or tobacco of the southern dates, and
upon the potash, the horses, the onions,
or the manufactures of New-England:
(hould the middle dates, or either the
eadern or southern dates, combine with
an influential minider, who has a facil
ity of making datements suited to such
dcfigns, the one part, may, in this way,
go free of direct taxes, whild the other
parts of the union are oppressed.
It is as easy to change the nature of
things, or to change truth itfelf into
error, as to dedroy the force of this con
cluiion, if luch principles are admitted
to govern the legislature.To f.iy that the v.-eflern people contri
tmte through "no other channel to the sup
port of go vernment, is a wmto 1 afoerfion,
or a gross mifconcepcion. In the .western
pert of alone there i? proba
bly, from fifty thoufanct to iixty thousand
buljlets offalt confuted, from v.Mirh a more
extravagant impo't is levied than from ar
ritles of the highefl Insuryâmd those who
by such affiertions, in
ferring likewise that our western citizens
-â iy nothing upon the consumption of Kuro
pc-an, Fa-tor Weft-India goods, ought, for
the fake of candor and truth, to co.iect in
formation from the merchant-j of Philadel
phia, Baltimore, ?ic. whose accounts would
at once corre t the nrita'ce, remove the
prejudice, and confound thÂ» malice of the
si-g-iment.-. dra .vn from this source in favor
or'the excise.
But it is to be lamented, that few will
arch for a truth wii ch the* dread or dis
like tod.fcove ", nor while measures are
pursued, Â«.vh'ch dare not be avowed, can we
be furprifpd to trace all tl.e machinations ot
n.i inventive genius, directed to amuse and
perplex not to inform and convince. Some
politician - li ve said, " if the people will be
r ccivkl let them be so " But to the ci
tizen--' o- America, the desire of knowledge
i hub coal, and such men never will, not
can be deceived.

Extrafl tf a letter from a gentleman in Marfrillet
10 tit's correspondent in this city, dated March xx.
" \ ou will receive this by the American

make remittances in bills 011 London, which
are now at fifteen and three-fourtlis to fif
teen pence for a three livre allignat, and
likely to fail ftiii lower. As to other mat
ters, I will briefly mention what has occur
red here durng Gapt. Birkhead's ttay in
tliia port. âOne uight tile arms of the Spa
nilli Gonful were taken out from the out
ward door of his house, avid hung at the
irqn collar of tiie pubfc market, where
they icinained till nine o'clock in the morn
ing In the afternoon they were returned
by order of the municipality to his house ;
but he having in the mean tanefent an ac
count of this insult to his court, they were
not replaced. He has since departed, whe
ther by order from his court or not, is un
certain. The municipality, however, iiid.
Ed a proclamation, forbidding iuch illegal
ixsefles, whatever might be the national,
complaints againlt the conduct 0:' certain
powers.âA fortnight ago about 1200 of
national guards arrived here, with guns
mounted, inc. and took their departure a
jain for Aix (lixteen miles north of Mar
seilles ) without any orders except from the
club of Jacobins. At Aix they were joint a
by about 6000 others from the country, and
mounted 18 pieces of cannon round the
jarracks, where the br?ve Swiss regiment
of Heraeft had been ltationed 'by order of
ihe commander in chief of the military de
partment. A fort of capitulation enlued,
and in conference of orders from thefame
department, the whole regiment, officersand folder', mirched off, leaving a'l their
fire-arms, swords, Sfc. (which became the
prey of the co:i-.;.u.erors). They proceeded
â without halting, to Roquiva re, where tlie\
â¢were received as if they had cLcÃroved tht
nation, an-i were obliged to go to the Beatll

THE bf Coljjrefe just closed has
been tliftitlgmfhed by feverai circtunftances
highly intereftlng to the Unittd St i',e
The rtegative put by the President 011
the bill for apportioning repreleiitarives
being the firft exercise of that power, and
being interposed in defence of the constitu
tion, is worthy of particular regard, hoth
a: it illustrates the wisdom of that check
in the government, antl the dignified and
patriotic firmnefs of the Chief Magistrate.
It must confeqtiently be viewed with nÂ« in
couliderable mixture of fatisfaftion, even
by those who did not concur in the con
ftruftion which prevailed.
The decision of the judges ngaiuft the
conflitutionality of an ast in which the ex
ecutive had concurred with the legislative
departments, is the firft instance, also, ii)
which that branch of the gov ernment has
xvithftood the proceedings of the others ;
a id being another refourie admitted by the
i onftitution for its own defence, and for
security of the rights which it guarantees
to the leveml states, and to individual ci

A militia system, the true and equal

Whiltt Congress have reaibnubly kepr
the door open for all non-fubferiber to the
public debt already bound upon them, they
hive made a fuccef ful stand aganft the
alarming policy of swelling the public debt,
by further and umieceffary afl'umptions.â
'1 hey have alio in several provirions and
unfimflied proceedings, exhibited a difpo
fi lon. which prefaces moi e effectual ef
forts for re ling public credit on its true,
unartlficial and natural for
rescuing us from the evils of a public deb:
as fact as the public faith and refnurces will
permit, and for discouraging thole mis
chievous (peculations and abules which
have been no less mortifying to the virtu
ous pride, than they h.ive been injurious
to the true interest' of a republican people-
In general it may be oblerted that the
fentimeuts and proceedings of the Jegifla.
tive body are aflurning a complexion more
in conformity with the republican princi
ples of the government and genius of the
people. In what degrees the change is to
be ascribed to the force of truth operating
on involuntary error, to the new fund ol
abilities and sentiments added to and min
gled the antecedent mas., or to the
salutary refieftion and re-action from an
enlightened and awakened public mind, i
a calculation that might be curious, and
not without its use, but which it is neither
neceflary, nor perhaps as yet practicable,
to execute with exaftnefs. It is of more
immediate importance to draw from the
fact the consolatory hope that the aberra
tions nf the government in any instances
from the plain and direst path of republi
can policy, will be gradually corrected by
the influence of reason and refponlibility,
until every great public measure lliall be in
due accord with the tone of a virtuous and
well-informed public mind, and tend to
the accoinplilhment of the beneficent pur
pores which a free people had in view w hen
they planned and adopted the present na
tional government.

THE man that joins in life's career
And hopes to find some comfort h'ere 5
To rife above this earthly mtfs,
The only way's to drink his glass.
But still on this uncertain stage
Where hopes and fears the foul engage ;
And while amid the joyous band
Unheeded flows the meafur'd sand,
Forget not, as the moments pass,
That Time shall bring the parting glass.
In spite of all the mirth I heard
This was the glass I always fear'dâ
The glass that would the reft destroy,
The farewell cupâthe close of joy.
With you, whom reason taught to think,

But with the fool, the sot, the ass,

The Ju.klcfs wight, that still delays
His drink of joy to future days-
Delays too longâfor then, alas !

Who Jeels no guilt, and knows no fear :

Mr, Hartley's SPEECH in the House of Re pre
fevtatiscs of the United. States, on the further
ajjumptian cf the State Debts,
March 31.
In committee of the whole, upon the State
Debts.
Mr. Hartley-
After so long a difcufiion my attempting to
take up any great length of time, would not be ex
cufeable ; but I consider it my duty to fay a word
or two, in answer to some charges and observa
tions, used against the constitution and operation
of this government $ and give a few reasons, why
I shall, at this time, vote for the resolution un
der confederation.
It will not be neceflary for me to- take into
View the principles upon which the constitution
was framedâthey were fully examined in the gen
eral convention as well as the fcveral state conven
tions, and flood the test of the ftri&eft scrutinyâ
they are favorable to liberty and justice.
As to the operation of this government, we
tray best understand it by contrasting the state of
Amsrica at the adoption of the constitution with
the present day. At the former period, our cre
dit, as United States of America, was at a low
ebb. Few of the individuals of foreign countries
would give a credit to the individuals of this.
The capitals of Europe would not be trusted in
America. They doubted our justice as well as
â¢ar government.
There was scarcely any credit given among in
dividuals here. A universal distrust prevailed.
Agriculture languishedâthe farmer diffident she
had loft his confidence. The great spur to indus
try was wanting.
No (hips on your stocks; few veflels in your
harbours ; -commerce decayed j the vital spirit
loft. I might fay more.
What is our present state ? The ciedit of our
government is as good as that of any country.
The individuals of all nations will trust the
individuals of America. Individuals (until a late
unfortunate bubble or abuse of credit, arising from
bad men or bad management, and which poflibly
may only hart for the moment) gave full credit to
each other as far as their capitals extended ; as
well in the city as in the country, and confidence
prevailed.
Agriculture, where the people are industrious
and apply their attention to the raising of those ar
ticles which are most in demand, is in the highest
improvement ever known here before. ] can
speak with confidence of the state I live in. The
idle and indolenr can expect no great foccefs in
any art orprofefiion which depends upon the stea
dy hand of industry.
There are (hips on the stocks in every port
where there are ship-builders and materials. The
tonnage lift will shew the vast increase of the Ame
rican (hipping. It has far exceeded the most san
guine expectation.
Several of the firft merchants state your com
merce in a most refpe&able situation, far beyond
any other period. Indeed, the returns from the
Secretary of the Treasury shew how great our im
ports, and how vast our exports are.
In point of justice, our reputation stands high
with the worldâOur courts will do justice.
Pray what foundation fox those strong aflertions
which have been made against the constitution
and the government?
As to the funding fjftem, I shall fay little at
present. I much doubt if it deserves the Lad
names which have been given it. Abuses will be
:ommitted iÂ» all countries j no human plan can
be secure against them.
The aflumption of the state debts was fully con
lidered upon a former occasion.âSeveral of us
jvifhed to fund the debts of the union alone.
Many gentlemen of the fbuth, when we came to
ook for ways and means, voted against us, and
;he eastern representatives were always ready to
oin in defeating us, unless the aflumption of the
late debts also took place.
The bill pafl'ed the House of Representatives
r or fundine the debts of the union alone ; but the
Senate sent it back with an amendment, assuming
he state debts to a certain amount. After much
argument, the amendment of the Senate was a
jreed to by the House of Representatives. Jus
tice was nearly done to some states, others do com
plain, and I think Rhode-island with strong rea
son.
I could have wished that the accounts between
:he United States and the several States had been
ettled : but I will give the gentlemen, who com
>lain so much, an opportunity of fatisfying the
louse, if they can, when the blanks are to be fil
ed up in the bill, that the lums they demand are
â¢eafonable, and are intended to give relief to the
>eople of their states.
1 will vote for the resolution.
To which Mr. FINDLEY replied :
IF I am not altogether so elated with our pre
"ent prosperity and resources, as my worthy col
eague who is just fat down, (Mr. Hartley) I af
"ure you I am not despondingâl think our re
ources are competent, and our circumflances not
leprened,âthe great industry of our citizens, and
he great demand and high price for our produce
n foreign markets, which took place about two
fears ago, gave a spring to our wealth and indul
ry, and furnished ample resources to government;
>ur feelings have not been pierced with the cries
>f general distress, until very lately, thrgugh the
ibufe of the novel principles introduced in the
unding system.
But though I rejoice with the gentleman in the
"ufficiency of our means, yet I consider ourselves
n the situation of an unexperienced heir, newly
ome to the enjoyment of a great estate, who, be
ng dazzJed with his own splendor, and con
ident of his means, lets about spending without
yftem or principles, and gets embarralted before
le is aware.
We are told, that the principle of afluming the
late debts is already admitted by the last Con
;refs, therefore it ought to be compleated now j
ve are just told, too, that it was fully considered
here.
I alk then, Why was not the business fully
:ompleted at that timeâif it was not, then what
reason can be given for carrying it further
iow ?âls there any new discovery of better rules
;o apportion by, or is the distress of the states who
lave yet some unaflumed debt, as prelfing as when
hey had to bear the burthen of three or four mil
ions more than now ? Gentlemen knew that the
ength this business has gone already, has given
jreat uneasiness to those states who made the
treateft exertions to extinguish their own debts,
ind to whose circumstances and feelings the re
ources applied to (he afiumed debts of the states,
we diftrefiing and disagreeable.
For what purpose are the commifiioners em-
in adjuftingthe accounts between the indi
vidual states and the United States, if the whole
>f the state debts were to be afiumed previous to
;hat settlement ? We know the government is not
irefted with powers to compel delinquent states to
lo justice , and that if ever justice is done to those
states who have extinguished their own debt, it
must be by increasing of the general revenue in
proportion to the money Congress will have ro pay
to those states, and it is an unjuftifiable and dan
gerous policy to draw the money from the people
â¢vith the one hand, to jay it to the state govern
ments with the other.
1 havefuch information as I can depend upon,
[hat the commiflioners will report upon the final
settlement of the state debts, in the courfeof next
winter j and the resolution before the committee
makes no provilion for interest until after the year
1792. Why then take this further leap in the
iark, when those states who will be attually enti
tled to it, will be as soon relieved according to the
principles of justice, as they would by diihibuting
;he public property in this manner by rule of
thumb.
1 always thought the aflumption of the state
jfebts a measure which the constitution did not
:onlemplate, and which had a tendency to sow the
feeds of discontent in many parts of the United
States, and now it is argued that the precedent
being set by the Jaft Congress we ought to copy
itl admit of no principles of infallibility in
Congressâand if precedents produce an obligation,
Me ought to be th; more careful not to strengthen
them by repeating such as are improper or doubt
ful. The only plausible reason for afluming the
state debts in the last Congress so far, was to ease
the burden of such states as had been most backward
in providing for their refpe&ive debts, so as that
they might be able to provide for what remained
until the accounts would be fettled, and to make
some prÂ»vifion for the states who had done much
to extinguifti their debt as a security that the
debts would be brought to a final settlement.
Certainly those states, at whose desire, and for
whose conveniency so much has been do*e, ought
to have a little more moderation.

Dulce eji internum dejipereâ¢
THE etymology of the following four wordi
appears to me to be much more modern
than is commonly supposed. They are evidently
ind radically of Engliih origin, as every one
learned in thathiftory and language will readily
perceive.
1. Sycophant,âwas the nick-name of a man
that lived in the reign of James thefecond. He
bad an old aunt that resided in the family, in a
great measure as matter of favour. The o!
woman having lived to an extreme ase, and like
Iy to live much longer, and the nephew, fceinj
quite tired of her, would frequently exclaim, 1>
Jlck of aunty ivderd t Vm very Jick of aunt. Not
withstanding this, wilhing to heir - what {he pof
felled, he always carried a fair face to her wher
present. Hence arose the word Jycophant, oi
one who flatters for feifilh purposes.
2. Go/pel,âAn ignorant man, about the mid
die of the left century, took a notion all at onc<
to learn to read. His fchool-rnaiier, after teach
ing him the firft elements, soon after, and rather,
prematurely, set him to, and kept him constant
ly reading the four The fellow, a:
might well be expelled, made continual blunders
and the matter would as constantly cry out, " A
pretty fellow to read, surely ! âgo, you block
head, go spell I^âThe perpetual r< eurrence of th<
cry of go fpell'in the fcliooi, occalioncd these booki
at length to be called gospel.
3. Bombazineâ A thin India fluff, in which
the natives of that hot country were so dressed
frequently without any under garment. Tin
Englilh, upon their fir It visiting India, said it wa:
a lhame for people to wear such fluff, which wa;
so very thin that their bums might plainly be fee;
through. Their constantly talking of the in
dians bums beingf.cn, at length inlenfibly gave ;
name to this kind ot flimly frabric, at prelcm
written bombazine, bur originally bum-be-feen.
4. Ariflocracy This word is, by so.me, tho'i
to be of Greek derivation. I deny it. By righi
it ought to be pronounced 11 hariftocracy," ant
for the following reason -During the ufnrpa
tion of Oliver Cromwell there lived a printer ii
London, who wa3 a violent republican. Hi
name was Harry Hullfifh. Some time before th<
restoration, feeing their newfangled republic wa:
nearly at an end, he turned fairly about and be
gan to print furiouliy in favor of kingly fuprema
cy, hereditary fucceflion, titular dignities, See

with the venal and servile government which wa
soon after eftablilhed, and has ever fines beei
continued in that country, has, as it were, ap
propriated the name of barijlocracy } or, arrflocra

liberties of the many are to thii day retained ii

BOSTON, April 26.
THE curiosity of the public is again excited t
enquire, when and on what terms, the officers 0
the late army will think their meritsÂ» their Aiffer
ings, and services properly rewarded : They hav
aifumed a diftin<stion of fupeiiority to their fel
low-citizens ; and by the inltitution of the focie
ty of the Cincinnati, implicitly told them, " w<
are better men than you are, and delerve to ftani
on better ground than jou do." Their countr;
has given them five years extra pay in commuta
tion for half pay during life : The larftentatioi
over the ingratitude and injustice of the countr
towards them is still kept up. They now com.
forward with a petitiou in effect, for a difcrimi
nation in their favor, which has been denied t(
their fellow-citizens at large 5 and if granted now
must be at the public expence, instead of coming
out of the pockets of those harpies, who firll de
preciated the public currency, then plundered thei
honest fellow citizens, made their own fortunes
and eftablilhed an influence, which screens then
fiom justice.
It it be not too late for the arm 0/ jullice t<
extort from thole wretches, the spoils 0/ their op
preflion and wickedness, for the purpose of ap
plying, without any diftin&ion, equity and joftic<
to all, it would be happy for the country, to havi
done new, what would have been done before, i
Mr. Madison's motion, (founded on the best prin
ciples, and sup ported by the faireft reasons) ha<
succeeded in the last Congress ; and in that caf't
that the late army /hould fliare with their fellow
citizens in the benefits resulting from it.
I feel no difpofttion to detract from the merit
and services of the officers of the armyâthe;
were undoubtedly great j so were those of man]
others in different departments : They have ha
zarded and fuffered much j so have many others
quite as much : They have had some confidera
tion j 110 other man or description of men hav*
had any, not even their brethren of the navyâii
whofecafe the most metaphysical casuistry canno
make a diftintf ion.
Most oj the officers of the army (after all tha
has been said) were in better circumltances afte
the war, than they were before it: and some o
them better off than they probably would hav
been if they had not gone into the army j whill
most of those who served the public in differen
lines, could boa ft that they were poorer at the en
than they were at the beginoing of the war.
Justice is a noble comprehensive virtue, and ap
plies equally to all men.âFavoritism, or a par
tiality for any man or class of men, is a narrow
contra&ed vice. The firft exalts a nationâth*
last disgraces a government.
