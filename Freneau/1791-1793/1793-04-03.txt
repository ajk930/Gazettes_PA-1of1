SIR, â . " ' ' ' *
TH-, lalt letter, wfthb I had the honor
1 A to address to tilt' Houle of Repre en
t â¢ lives, cÂ«ntÂ»iaeÂ«l a pretty full expomioi
of tl:e conduct a'ttl views of this depart
ment, i:i regard to loans There
1 email, however, for.re incidental topics,
vs hich it may not be expedient to pass over
in silence.
In order to carry the attention of the
house immediately to a jilft applicat 0:1 of
the remarks which w ill be iubmitted, it
necefiary to preirifeâthat it is known t-.
have been Aiggefted, thas the proceeds of
the foreign I ill drawn for to this country,
had no object of public utilityâanfvyered
noneâand were calculated meiciy to in
dulge a spirit cf favoritism towards the
bank of tne United States.
It has already been fhevvn clearly I trirft.
th it but for the inltru mentality of the parts
of the loan drawn for prior to April 1792,
amounting nearly to one half of the whole
sum, the purchail s of the deb: which were
made to that time, could not have been
made ; and that these piirchafes, hefideÂ»
being the obje.'l cL.-figi.nle I by law, for the
application 0/ the tund, were productive
of positive and important advantages.
Ho v far the operation could have been
i lfluenced by motives of favor to the bank
of the United States, the following facts
â will still more completely decide.
The bank did not begin its operations till
the 12th of December 1 ?9Â«â¢
The banks of North-America and New-
York wer* the agents of the treasury for
the file of the hi lis in queftio 1. Tiiey fold
them, coUefted, and, with the exception
which will be presently dated, dilburfed
the proceeds.
The receipts on account of those bills,
began in M irch 1791, and concluded in
M 'rch c 92.
On the Jift of December 1791. as the
Treafu "er's account before the House wiil

There were then alfofome monies in the
banks of North-America and New- ork.
in the course of receipt, which had noi
been parted over to the Trcafurer ; but al
the' public monies of whatever kind, in t!u
bank of the United States, are included ir
the ah.ive sum of 133.000 dollars, whicl
had ar'fen from the duties on imports and
tonnage.
It appears then, that on the Â°f De
cember 1791, no transfer for the benefit ol
the bank of the United States had been
made ; antj that the depolits of the gov
ernment there (exchiliv-' of the proceed;
of the bills remaining in the two banks ol
North-America and New-York) amount
ed to little more thai) i-4th of the deposit:
in the ; bal>k' of North-America, and little
more than 1-2 oi tiiofe in the bank oi
New- York.
A > late as the i!t of February, the state
hanks continued to (hare with the bank ol
Th â¢ United States a proportion ot the
public depolits. The Uate of the treafurj
was as follows, viz. Dolt;.

A concentration of the public depolits
in the bank of the United States was a
menfirre which grew out ei the relation
between that ellablilhment and thegovern
nient. Yet in ft cad of ha 'ening it through
favour, it was resolved to let it have a.gra

gree, the convenience of the other bapks ;
and to eEeft it rather by letting the public
d.foui fements f;i 11 upon the monies in those
banks than by direct transfer.
But a state of things took place in the
month of February, between the batiks of
the United States and North-Africa,
u hie 1 rendered a more expeditious fVatif

ftateninit of half monthly balances, ac

No. V.
The fame statement n 1(1 a t vv, that a
proportion of tile public depofi'S has con-.
t>'tied since the lit of April 1792 in the
:ate banks; in thofc of North-America
aiul New - York down to the e :d of the pe
riod, which that ltatement embraces.
from these details the following infer
ences are dudticible.
That as far as any advantages may have
accrued from the depolits 011 account oi
the foreign bills drawn prior (o April 1793,
they accrued fubltantially to the banks of
North-America and New-York, not to the
bank of the United States or to its branch
es. That in transferring the pecuniary
concerns of the government from the pre
exiiling banks to that of the United States
and its dependencies, a cautious regard has
been paid to the convenience of the form
er institutions, and the reverse of a policy
unduly solicitous for the accommodation
of the bank of the United States has pre
vailed. Indeed so much has this been the
cafe, that it might be proved, if it were
proper so enter into the proof, that a cri
ticism has been brought upon the conduct
of the department, as confuting less the
accommodation of the last mentioned in
llitution, than was due to its relation to the
government and to the services expected
irom it.
But further examination will demon-,
ftrate another paint ; whuhis, that none
of the eftablii'hrnents in queflion have re
ceived any accommodations, which were
not in perfect concidence with the public
intcreil, and in the due and proper course
of events.
This examination will be directed to
wards two objects , one, the state of the
Treasury, at the commencement of ea.h
quarter, during th? years 1791 and r 79--
the other, the ltate of the market, in re
gard to the prices ufftock, during the fame
years.
These periods are because they
afford the truelt criterion of the Hate o!
the Treasury, from time to time, being
tliofe at which the principal public pay
ments are made ; and for which it is nir
leifary to be prepared by intermediate ac
cumulations.
The state of the Trecfury at the peri
ods ii] quefiioii, was as follows :
In the year 1791.
January 1. Dols. 569,886.55

This appears from the flutements Ino.
IV and V, forwarded with my 1 ast letter,
The Pot of theflock m;.r:cet, during the
several quarters of the fame years, was as
followsâ
First quarter of 1791.
Six per cents from 16/9 to 1-/6
Three per cents from 8/6 to 9/4
Deferred from 8/6 to 5/4
Second quarter of 1-91.
Six per cents from 17/ to 17/9
Three per cents from 9f to 10/
Deferred from f'/i 1 to 5/4
Th'rd quarter of (791.
Six per cents from 17/10 to 21J$
Three per cents from 9/9 to 12/5
Deferred from r/9 to 12/10
As early as the fcth of August, the lix
per cents had a temporary rife to 21\J'. but
by the jhey had fallen to 2</, on the
2Cui they had rifento2o/6, and w ere some
times above that rate, but never lower
during the reft of the quarter.
As earlyasthe23d of July, the three per
cents had reached 12/, and were some
times, higher, but never lower during the
relt of the quarter.
On the 23d of July, the deferred also
reached 12/. and afterwards rose to 12jb.
Fourth quarter of 1791.
Six per cents from 20/4 to 22/4
Three per cents from 12/2 to 13/8
Defer, ed from 11/8 to i_/6
Tlie prices wereloweft 111 the early, and
highelt in the latter part of the quarter.
During the whole of the month of De
cember, the deferred was at 12/S and up
wards ; the greatest part of the time at
'3/'
First quarter of 1792.
Six per cents from 21/ to 25/
1 liree per cents from 12/6 tÂ» 15/
Deferred from 12/ to i 5/
The low prices w ere in the last ten days
of March.
Second quarter of 1792.
Six per cents from 2cj tq 22/t
Three per cents from 12j to 1
Deferred from 1/6 to 14/4
Third quarter of 1792.
Six per cents from 21/ to 22/3
Three per cents from 12/4 to 1;/
Deferred from iÂ»/3 to 1 If]
Fourth quarter of 1792.
Six per cents from 2cfx to 21/9
Three per cents from 12/3 to 13/fc
Deferred from 1 1/10 10 13/6
In October the deferred was at the high
elt. The lowelt prices were in the month
of December.
This view of the fnbjeÂ£t is derived from
f. fiatement of prices pursuant to actual
purchases aad faies, furnilhed by a dealer
of this city, refpeciable lor his intelligence
and probity, combined with the accounts
from time to time published in the Gazette
of the United States. The papers mark
ed A and If, are transmitted for the more
particular information of the lioufe 011
this head.
The market prices of stock no doubt
varied at other places, as loir.e may have
been higher, at others lower. At Phila
delphia too,'tis believed, that firiall funis
were obtained at particular periods from
necefiitous individuals; below the prices in
the Statement.
But there is good ground of reliance that
it is substantially a jult representation of
the state of the Hock market, during the
periods to w liich it refers.
Tiie date of the Treafurv from the ill

doHars then i:i the bank of North-America,
from the proceeds of Amfleruam bills, be
yond the advances of the Bank lor the pub
lic service ; which had not been pajJc.L in
to the Treasurer's account. It is propel,
to remark that the course qf imputations
occafioits large receipts in the l.after pare
of each year, which clrciimliance contri
butedto the accumulation in quefuon.
From the lail of November to about, the.
2Vft of March, an investment of the excess
on hand in pur chafes was impracticable.
To- enable the House to underhand wha?,
is meant by faying that purchases were im
practicable during that periud, it ii neces
sary to add, that the priccs of flock, ex
ceeded the limits which the c<iuinii(liqitÂ»j s
of the linking fund had prefei i'oed to them -
"elves. Indeed a large propm tion of the;
time those prices were mainici'.] / arfiti-iil,
and such as predicted a great i .U not fa;.
:li(la:;.t. The delay incurred accord-
t ..^
which invetioieuts were afterwards mad*.
From the 2ill of March to the ij'hui
April, purchases were fcffe&ed to the c-x
---:ent of 242,688 dollars and 31 cent;, in fpe
:ie ; within 80 or 90,000 dollar* of what
:ould have been spared, conliltently with
:he rule which has been mentioned, as
proper to regulate th? arrangements ps
1 reafury.
But two circumilances operated againlt
i further investmentâa (Udden rife of
prices and a state of temporary d.forder 1.1
the two principal nurcantjie fcenesof the
country (occaiioned by the excessive fpeiil
lations that had preceded) which adiwi
lilhed the treasury to be cautious in itsdif-
Durfements.
It refillts from the foregoing view of the
Ã¼bjeft, that as far as any extraordinary
"urn may appear to have remained unem
ployed in the banks a longer term than
ivas delirable, it proceeded efientialiy frun
i state of things, which did not permit its
employment ; and is in no degree attri
jutable to that spirit of favoritism towards
Jiofe ellablilhments or any of them, which
lias been imagined as the solution of ap
pearances, not rightly imde.lioud, an 4
much overrated.
The only quell'on, then, of which the
matter is fufc>.p;ible, is thisâ\\ ; s not tha
(late of things, chat did take pi ce, to have
been forefeen ; fp as to have influenced
the drawing for a proportionally Uls
sum ? 1
This question may fafeiy be anfwrre;' in
the negative.
The bills, the proceeds of which contri
buted to constitute the Â«-xiefs, which re
mained unemployed during the two quar
ters, were drawn in May 1791- luth.it
month the highest prices of flyck were
17/2 for iix per cents. 9/2 lor three per
ients, and 9/3 for deferred.
No reasonable anticipation at this junc
ture, of the progreui\e 1 iie of fUnk could
have carried i. in so (holt a time to the
height which it attained, cr beyond the li
mits within which purchases w ere deemed
advantageous. 'L he rapid and extraordi
nary rife, which did ensue, was in fact ar
tificial and violent ; such as ho dittfee c
calculation of probabilities could havepie
fnppofed. It therefore cannot impeach the
prudence if expediency of having mane
proviliou, on a diifcrent fuppoiition, ior an
extenfton of purchases.
The proceeds of the bills which wera
drawn fubfeqnentto May, only began to
be ccllcifi d about the beginning of Febru
ary, and continued in lollec.h 11 till the
29th of March. Oil the fecund of Ft bruany

âI mean the National Bank; this, is a
fubjec , of nÂ» fulall importance to the peo
ple; especially when we take into coniide
ration all its various confeqtiences.
The fntit of this poisonous plant hath
already arrived to a partial maturityâthe
taste enables us to form a decision. Our
merchants and planters already begin to
feel, with anguilh, the disadvantage of this
pernicious institution, and experience the
great Madison's prediction in its fulieft
force ; " that it would have an immediate
tendency to banifli gold and silver from
public view." If it flopped here, iricon
vaniency would be the only detriment
which the community sustains ; but it is a
well known fact, that it hath been the
means already of draining the states of a
great portion of their circulating medium,
by enabling the wealthy merchant, who
resides within the sphere of its influence,
and confeqnently hath it in his power to
avail himfelf of the advantages of his credit,
to amaf vast quantities of specie, which
hath actually been (hipped off to India and
elsewhere :âWhat do we receive in re
turn for this substantial coin, but gewgaws
and fuperfluous articles of luxury ? and
what does it avail the irduftrious citizen,
altho' the capitals of our merchants are in
creased, if the necefl'aries of life are en
hanced in proportion ? Turn the eye to
New-York and Philadelphia, ana the fact
fppuks tor itfelf.
I am sensible that the advocates in favour
of banks, assert, that they are calculated to
promote commercial intercourse, and to
facilitate the collection of the revenue ;
but does the faCt correspond with the
theory ? Do they reflect that the fitutation
of this country is different from any in Eu
rop>e ? In old commercial and manufactu
ring countries, banks may be a ready means
of facilitating the intercourse between mer
chant and merchant; but it does not thence
follow, that in an agricultural country like
this, the fame system is beneficial. Among
trailing people a certain promptitude in all
transactions, is necefiary and practicable ;
but will any one fay, that in a country
where the means of payment are obtained
from the earth but once a year, it i-; poffiblc
to introduce the fame fyflem of punctual
ity. The institution of the national bank
may facilitate the colleflion of the reve
nue ; but while other methods may be de
vised to accomplilh this desirable objeCt, 1
tan never assent to a system for a partial
conveniency only, which affeCts a whole
people in its hurtful confcquences âwhile
t is left to the judgment (perhaps to the
caprice) of a public officer, or collector, to
;ive a currency to the notes of this or that
particular bank, or branches of a bank, by
refilling the notes of others, as payment â
I cannot but view the whole bufmef a;
calculated to favor too much the project;
of particular speculators. It is too intri
cate, and too partial in its operations foi
the general system of a great country ; ant
the uecejfity which wiil be urged as a plea
for this partiality, i.< of itfelf a fufficiein
evidence that the system is not that exten
lively ufeful institution, which it has beei
heretofore represented.
Does not the oeconomy of this country,
the arra'/gemehts and interefls of its inha
bitants, contradiCt the bare fup'.iofition ot
this system's being eventually productive o!
general good ? 1 hope the citizens ol thi:
part of the ftatc, will discover its abfurdiiy.
before they enter upon the futile attempt
of introducing funilar institutions amonj.
ourselves. I have neither leisure nor in
clination, to euter into the minulia ol the
banking systemâl can only regret that ti.t
community in general, are too ealily lee
into a scheme which contemplates lor it:
objeCt the interest, only, ot a certain de
ft ription of menâand those perhaps nol
the most ufeful members of society."
\From the Jame paper, of Rlarch 22â]
"BEING actuated by the fame lauda
ble motives which induced me in my la ft
to contribute my mite toward the promo
tion of the public weal, 1 have again ven
tured to come forward ; under the impref
lion that those observations become mort
and more applicable to the exigency ol
the present times.
In my last I exposed a fuperftcial view
only of those evils with which the inftitu
tion of the national bank is fraught. Is i;
necefiary to observe that this system is cal
culated for the purpose of enabling the
flock-holders to monopolize the whole 01
the importation bulinefs ? T hat to thi:
source maybe traced the present fcarcit\
of money, and the low rate of exchange :
That the contention which exists betweci
the national and state banks, operate to the
ruin'of many industrious individuals in tlu
trading towns ? These things are too ob
vious to eicape the traanlient view of tlu
most common observer.
11 is with 110 small degree of reluCtance;
indeed nothing but the legard which I feel
for the intrrelt of my fellow citizens,
could induce me to probe this fore to the
bottom, and point out where the evil lies.
Obftaprincipiis, is a maxim perhaps, net
less important in state affairs, than in the
healing art. It has become not on]y the
interest, but the duty of every individual
of this society, to check the growing evils
which have already acquired too mini
llrength and vigour.
That a number of the members, of the
most augi'ft affembty in rhe Amer.car
world, are deeply interested in the con
cerns of this nefarious institution, is a faCl
too notorious to be denied. With what
rapid and indecent strides does corruption,
intrigue and venality advance itfelf int<
the very center of this honorable body
We contemplate thefc iniquities in anci
ent and wealthy governments with lef:
horror, because we have been accuftomec
to fee depravity of mind keep equal pacc
with the augmentation of riches, and
grandeur of a people : But the honell
mind recoils at the idea of our furpt-'fling in
vices already, a country whose inhabitants
could boast of their wealth, luxury and
degeneracy of manners, before even the
exifience of a western world was known.
Why fl.ould we conceal the causes.
which conspire to counteract the noble
efforts lately made by a disinterested and
patriotic member of the house, from V ir
ginia, to correCt the abuses which hac
crept into an important department of state?
What, but the undue influence which in
terest gives, could have secured that dif
graccful majority, which appeared in thi
cafe ? We are not surprised to fee the pat
riotic Fox in the minority of the Britifl:
house of Commons, in the latequeftion re

pliedabundantly with the means of fecurjng
to himfelf a majority ; but in this infant &
indigent country, it will be a matter of
aftonifliment to the whole world, how
the Secretary of the Treasury could effect
his purpose. Will any one doubt that it
reflects more honour on Mr. Fox, to be
found in the minority of a venal house,
than in the majority. The appfication
here reflects the highest honor, in my opi
nion, on the gentleman alluded to above.
We have occalion to felicitate ourselves
at the idea of being represented by one.
who hath kept himfelf uncoutaminated by
the stock-jobbing trade, in the midlt of
temptation by one who poflefles patriotic
intrepidity enough to oppose himfelf,for the
good of his country, to the united torrent
of intrigue, interest and corruption. And
we can also rejoice, that such worthy ex
ertions met \\ ith fnch worthy supportâ
although unfuccefsfnl. he yielded with the
virtuous Madison. If the mere aflertion
of a gentleman from the ealtward, brand
ing the iiivejligaticn with the epithets of
unprofitable and frivolous, were to have
weight, the risque of personal degradation
would be incurred, by all those who (hall
lercafter step forth in the glorious attempt
jf defending the injured rights of that
community, \\ho hss reposed confidence
n one of her virtuous Tons.
Can any fubjefl be of so much moment
o a free people, as the proper adminiftra
ion of their government âas the exaÂ£t ex

itives devote their time to any purpose so
jrofitable and important, (if they mean
dithfully to serve the interest of the peo
ple) as enquiring into the conduit of their
mblic officers ? Better if it that " the
liarm Ihould be founded" hundreds of
:imes without foundation, than that one
jffender againftthe sacred privileges of the
latiou, (hould escape unpunished. It is to
uch watchful guardians only, that a great
People should depute their concerns, and
Virginia will in fume future day have
;aufe to rejoice in the patriotic ardour of
lerfons. An intelligent and enlightened
people are not to be frightened by founds,
md will not hÂ»ve cause for defpondencv
because the interests of a lew speculators
ire injured.
I ihould be forrytofind that our excel
ent conltitution was falling Ihort of the
?xpeÂ£tptions of its firft framersâthis great
tnd elegant fabric confers immortal credit
m its founders. It is to be lamented that
"o many evils have in so (iiort a space of

lttributed to deviations from the firft prin

By a letter from Jamaica, addrefTed tc

took place on board the (hip Walp (ol

appears there was n combination on board
rncouraged by the captain, Robert Jones,

Forcing him .verboard after having beater
him with hand spikes, &c. put out one his

human manner.âWhit is remarkable,
al'.ho' a n amber of the cre.v were dis
charged at Montego Bay, not a single item
of the murder tranfpited till after the (hip
had cle ired out and failed. The whole
was then discovered and sworn to by one
of the crew, in coiifeqnence of which a

the captain had given out that it was hie

" I know not whether the appearance

his family. War, it was expedtcd, would
soon break out, but no accounts of its oe

The following particulars relative to the
death of Louis XK Ith are from a St. Eu-
Jlatius paper of March Bth.
On Sunday night he visited his family for
the last time, and after pending some time
with therp lie returned to his own apart
ment and supped as usual ; he slept toler
ably well that night, and arose about 7
o'clock on Monday morning, when after
fiime time spent in private devotion with
his confefTor, he informed the officer he
was ready ; the carriage being sent for,
he. with his confcfihr and the officer ap
pointed to attend him. went in, and pro
ceeded to the place of execution, guarded
by a p;:rty of the {National Guards ? when
tht-y arrived there he ascended the fcaffold
with great firmnefs ; asfoorias he got up
the executioner cut off his hair, at which
lie (hewed feme emotion, but soon recov
ering himlelf he advanced to the front of
the fcaffold where he addrtfled the popu
lace in tne following manner:
FRENCHMAN,
I die innocent ; it i? from the fcr (Fold in
the prefefite of Almighty God I tell you so.
i forgive n.y enemies and hope
Fere aconfufed cry of Grace Grace
was heard from the people around the
fcaffold j on which he was flopped and
hurried to the block, where his head wat
fevered from hi; body atone fhoUe ; the
executioner carried it twice round the
fcaft'old, and then, with the body, it was
thrown into a bafliet and conveyed to
Magdalen where a grave was prepared
with some quick lime in it.
The blood which flowed from Louis
XVI was gathered up, by some in paper,
and by others in white handkerchiefs, and
this was done by persons who had Hot the
air of attaching a political fuperftftinn to
itâtwo young lien of good appearance
were particularly noticedâone of them
who was a foreigner and had the appear
ance of an Engliflimrn. ga\e 15 livres to
a child and requeued it to steep a very

and some of the hair of Louis, for which
he paid a Lsuis d'Or.

We, 011 our part, are not fond of inno
vations, and are averse to multiplying
oaths.âWere we to ast under the late
commission, in concert with the above na
med gentlemen, wemuft submit to a re
petition of the oath of allegiance and or
oflice, without any apparent neceflity.
But for a moment admitting it was ne
cellary that we fiionld be re-appointed to
that otficb, we could not (loop to the in
dignity of holding offices, the tenor of
which is during pleasure. We could not
so far betray the rights of our fellow citi
zens, as to set a precedent which might
fubjeft the important trufl of judges of the
common pleas to the whim or capiice of
any one individual.
We have not yet forgotten, that this
was matter of complaint against the ad
miniltration of the Colonial government,
at the commencement of the late glorious
contefl with G. Britain.
In the articles of independence, ratified
on the memorable 4th of July, 1776, we
find the following clause inferredâ" He

the amount and payment of their salaries.
That judges Ihotild beindependent of the
executive, is expressly guarded by the
confutation of the general government,
and is a right we never can relinquish.

famous Lord Man field fa id to

twten the i)uke of Cumberland, the king's
brother, and Lord Grofvenor: " Gentle
man, suppose in the present cafe that you
have to judge between A. an 1 B ; forget
<he prince; fee <ji,ly the individual and
(lie fatt."
I fh II adilrcfs vnu, gentlemen, ir. the
fame fliic. The General whom you have
â¢Â° judge occupies an eminent poll, enjoys
a high reputation, ha 3 many friends ; 011
the other hand, his enemies are numerous;
violent accufafions are preferred ajrainft
him. You aie the representatives of the
people, and on the present occalion, a jury
of accusation, and confcquently to
b â¢ impartial. Hatred and favour ought
alike to be Grangers to ycur breads. Hate
the crime, but forget the man : hate the
crime, punish the man ; but firft take care
to verify the crime with the molt scru
pulous exaitnefs. This is the duty of
every one, and I am going to fulfill mine
religion fly. Two motives prompt me to
this : the remembrance of a f nrner friend
flap. and the dangers of my country. A
mongst all the misfortunes attending on re
volutions, there cannot be a great.r than
that of being obliged to condemn an old
friend. I experience it to-day. I have
seen Mr. La Fayette attached to the molt
rigid principles : Icheriftji d him then ; I
hoped he would display all his efforts in
their defence : a thousand times have I
conjured him to do it! An infernal coali
tion has poisoned his mind, and robbed
him cf his principles, and with them his
glory. I have endeavoure.', with o'.het
ftier.da, to fare him from their machina
tions ; he has rejected all my counsels, and
I renounce his friendfhio : he is no longei
any thing to me.âThe inflexibility I re
'â omm n j to you, and which ought to be
the charafteriftic of a jury of accusation, 3
fh-11 myfelf observe. Is it in the moment
when the enemy is upon oar frontiers,
when our country is in danger, that we
cuglt, that we can, give way to trifjinÂ®
paflions, to fpitefnl retaliations ? IXfhor.oi
to the wretch who fees nothing in this
cause but an enemy to punish, hut a party
to ridicule 1 to those who, substituting de
clamation to argument, and panegyric tc
the fair and honelt means of juflification,
would poflefs you with their felfifh princi
ples, when the queltion before you, is al
once to revenge and to save the conlli
tation 1
How desirable would it be, if we coulc
defer ourdomeftic quarrels 'till ourforeigr
enemies were defeated'! But the fatal let
ter of the 16th of June has been the apple
of discord thrown into this assembly ; il
has been the fig Hal of an inteltine war.
which it will be difficult to cxtinguifh, be
cause it has awakened animoftties that <
true patrio'ifm had laid afieep. The an
thors, the councilors of th s letter, theft
are t' e authors of our diflentions, of which
the effects are not to be calculated. Theft
are the real enemies of Mr La Fayette as
well as of the Nation 1 <\fTembly ; and yet
these are they who now demand a judg
ment, snd with an arioga.tce too against
which generofny revolts, but which can
not influence the dictates of justice.âYes,
gentlemen, we ought to judge, but with
out pafiion ; we have nothing to eonfult
hut the facts and the law.
What is the crime of Mr. La Fayette :
I shall Hot accuse him of being in concert
with the Aultriar.s : 1 cannot, however,
deny myfelf one reflettion. [fa General
had secretly planned the disgrace of the
French-armies & thefuccefs of the Auflri
<ii;s, what line of conduit would he have
pursued ? H? would have taken good care
not to enter Brabant,-)- though it offereJ
ivery circumft. nee proper to facilitate an
invaiion, ;vnd though it was guarded but by
,-t handful of troops ; he would have at
tempted nothing, but have staid in his in
trenchments ; he would, at molt, have ex
tended h:s operations to a few pitiful ilcir
mifhes, antJ would have placcd a camp in
1 is front, undefended, and an easy prey to
the envmy ; he world have continued this
camp in spite of the remonflrances of an
1 j tÂ« Aujhlivt Netherlands,
experienced Genera! ; he would have fuf
fered liis advanced-guard to engage ; he
v. ouIJ then have exaggerated tic d.cngtl
of the enemy, though far iuf.viorto that
of his,own ; lie would have inveighed a
gainrt tl-.e Bnbaeconr, becau'e tliey were
fucli fools rs not to revolt telore they had
any hcp-.sof protection. He would have
kcon;!ed hut feebly, the generals his col
leagues ; he would have comfelled them
to abandon the offenfive fjftem, and wi;h
it their conquefls ; he would have ltd l is
troops a ti(clefs dance expressly to fatigue
them, and to expefe our frontiers the while
to the ravages cf the enemy. He would
have quitted his army in the hour of dan
ger under the molt frivolous pretences ; he
would have gone into cantonments at the
moment when he ought to prefeni to the
enemy a formidable camp ; in a word, he
would have employed in camp-manoeuvres,
ufelcfs marches, intrigues and peti ions
the precautious part of the campaign, in
order to give the reinforce men'.s of the
enemy time to arriveâThis, gentlemen,
would have been the conduct of a g neial,
if l is only aim had been to favoir the
Audrians. Compate then this picture
with the brilliant exploits of Mr. La Fay
ette, before which Mr. Bureaux Pufy prc
! nds to prodrate himfclf; for he :s not
"ucb a novice as to be an idolater in good
earned. Ido not affii m that the General
was in concert v.i:h the Audrians, for, it
seems, nothing (liort of written proof will
Fi.ffice, an;. I :,ave none. Cut you who re
quire these proofs, confefs, at lead, that the
friend of the Audrians could not have
sited otli rwife. Confifs that here lias
been the molt profound incapacity or the
blacked peifidy.
In the year 1756, a court martial de
clared that Admiral Byng had negledted
his duty, ar.d in consequence of that decla
ration he was sentenced to death, accor
ding to the Englith militai-y code, which
punishes with death the General who f..al!
negkÂ£t his duty, whether it be by neg i
jenrc, cowardice, orperfidy. Thislaw may
perhaps be too rigorous for the common
dty cf men ; Washington, however,
would not have refufed to be judged by
r ; and if it were to decide the f>.te of his
lifctph he would soon be no more. But,
jentlemen, it is not under this point of
riew that I (hall examine the ir.ifdemean
irs of Mr. La Fayett#; they are not mi
itary faults that I accuse of, but politi al
:vimes, wicked attempts agiinfl. our con
stitution and our liberty.
I accuse him of having made an ill use
rfh s authority, arid of the force* the na
:ion had committed to his charge; of ha
ving exposed the fafety of the (late, anu of
in lating the conditution
Certainly 110 one will fay that these
things are not crimes ; for besides the ar
:icles of the constitution on this fubjedt,
if you open ihe penal code, part I. feÂ£t 2.
you will there read, " Every confpiration
' to hinder, by force, the deliberations of
' the legislative authorities, shall be pun
died with death."
Another : " Every confp'racy tending
" to trouble the public tranquility, by a
â¢ civil war, in arming the citizens against
:i one another, or againd any of the legal
' authorities, lhall be punidied with
' death."
Again : " Every public officer who by
" the abuse of his authority, Hiall, under
' any pretence whatever, engage the ct
' tizens to disobey any legal authority,
' fliall be punilhed with fix yeais impri
" fonmerit.
Now, gentlemen, you will find the
jreated part of those crimes in the let
ers and proceedings of Mr. 'a Fayette.â
fUI the fadtshave a tendency to the fame
:nd. Mr. la Fayette was determined
et it cost what it would, to he the Mo
'.erator of France. This is his favorite
jaffion, here we find the key to all his
:onduÂ£t ; and Mr. Torr.e lias very inge
lioufly applied it to the recent ; 5 well as
o the former events in which the gene
al has been a cons, leuous character.â
' his explains the hidory of the sth and
s>h of October, and his persecution cf
he Orleanic faction, to which he alone
bad given exidence : hi 3 resignation on
the affair of the famous loth of .April
and his coalition with men whom he de
telted : his double dealing upon the king's
escape to Vnrcnr.es, and his appearance
amongd the Jacobins,* whom he has
since persecuted. If at p.efent, gentle
men, Mr. la Fayette wiflies their deitruc
* So called, becavfe the/ met atfirj} in
a Dvminicni conveirt at Paris; thrDon.i-
Hie'ani bii"Â£ cJJo cat lid Jacobin-,
tior, it is r.ot becatife the Jacobir.s really
appear Criminal in his eyes, but bi caufc
the.r bundled rhoufan j lights expefe too
clearly li s Ira'tcrcus proj.'fls ; but be
cause they will rot ficond li s views for
the Diliatorfhip. If he anils his camp, it
is because lie world rather command at
Paris than watch the motior s of the Auf
trians, who besides do r.ot stem to be
very seriously at war with him. If l:e
p.fFi.dls so tinier a companion for the
king, and fnch a violent in-Jignati ;n at
the events of the 2< th of June, it is not
because he wps so foandaiizcd at the red
cap or so p; ffionattly f.md of kings-, but
to further his difi;,ns, it was r.cce'h.ry he
fi-,ould l.ave the air of bciig the pro eCtor
of the king, and have a pretext lor draw
ing his army towards the capital, that he
might there aÂ£t the part of a DiÂ£l tor.
But, fay they, you cannot condemn
without a positive .'aw ; and there ex
ids no law that condemns a man far cn
deavourir.g to become the or the
moderator of France. Is a pcfi' ive law
then necelTa:v to p'.ir.ifli pirriciJe ! and
can there be parricide ot a blacker dye
than that of attempting to ciuth our li
btrty for ever by a dldlato.' ! but, allow
ing thi 1..w not to exifl, at lead it will
be tranted me that it is criminal, ill, To
expufc the fa'fety of the flute ; 2Jly, To
violate the conllitution ; 3Jly, To at
tempt, by menaies, to cramp the delibe
rations of the legifiative body ; 4tbly, To
try tc debase the kgiflature ; s chly, To
endeavour to excite a civil wa .
Well then ! Mr. la Fayette has com
mittcd all these crimes- Much has alrea
dy been developed, and I Ilia 1 not repeat
what has been fufiiciently dwelt upo;;. I
fiiall particularly apply r.iyfvlf to the an
swering cf Mr. Dumolard, and in so doing
I /hall lookupân myftlfas having anfivcred
the otlur cratorsou thai fide of the queili
on. I throw inlircly af;de (and without
doubt the Alfembly will thank me for it)
that f art of the pleading-x-of Mr. Diimo
lard, in which he eternally fubllitutcs to
faÂ£ts, which he has not, thread-bare decla
mation foreign to the discussion. I fliall
take no uotiee of his diflcrtatior.s 011 the
people, which he refpefls in the mass, be
:aufe that mass is ra where. I dia l take no
notice of the a-t use he h s so l.'.e ally be
[lowed 011 the fadtious, who are wicked
:n;ugh to regard Mr. La Fayet.e as the
chief of a faÂ£lion, when lie boalls of being
the organ of the bcmjlpet.p'e f and of lus
army; on the journa'iils whom he flanders
in answering to their calumny. 1 (hall
lake 110 notice of his indignation (which
every body shares) at the parallel between
Casfar and Mr. La Fayette; of his in
credulity (which every one does not
[hare with the civil tiji) upon the Austrian
committee J 011 his profound theory on
the libels which offend him in supposing
him to be a man of much profefiional prac
lice; or of his panegyric on Mr. La Fa
yette, which speaks him as little acquain
ted with the American revolution as with
that of Rome; for Casfar has no where
hocjlcd of a Jcratch, nor were the whole cf
his exploits a prudent retreat. But i (hall
enter at oace into the fads, and the ob
jedlions.
Mr. Dumolard denies that General La
Fayette exposed the (afety of the Hate
in quitting his army ; but gtn'.lemcn
when this army was in the face of the en
emy, wh .n it was in continual expectation
of an attack, when every ii.ftant might
ffer the general an opportunity of profit
ing by the errors of the Auftrians, w hen
Marlbal Luckner was in the fame fitua
;ion, when by aililting him in the taking
â¡f two or three more towi.s the iflfuirec
tion in Brabant might have been comple
ted : furelv to abandon the amy at a
lime like this was a horrid tieafon. Will
Mr La Fayette fay there was nothing to
fear ? That maybe, geriiieiiv. n, if the war
were not in ea ne/t, but it it wtre, was
there nothing to hope for, nothing to be
attempted against the /.tiÃrians ? Wai.

For, gentlemen, the tw en.y live thor.fsnd
Auilrians of Maulde, whom Mr. Buie-uix
Pufy has told you of, may be very conve
