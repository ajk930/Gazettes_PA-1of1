For the NATIONAL GAZETTE.
Mr. Freneau,
Believing the following fads to be worthy of
general record, inall the news papers and
cilmanacts, through which much ufeful
'.notvledge is imparted, it is requejltd
they may be duly noticedfor that purpose
in your paper.
r T~UAJi great Frederick lid of Pruflia,
_I_ who was an excellent farmer, ob
serving experience had demonstrated that
a mortality among the cattle was more
frequent in Brandenbourg than in Silesia,
made enquiry into the califes thereof.
Two reasons were discovered which occa
sioned tliis difference. The firft, that in
Brandenbourg, no use was made of fait,
fcs was the cullom to do, abundantly, in
Silesia : And the second, that the inha
bitants of Brandenbourg, did not grass
feed their cattle, under cover, as those of
Siltjfia did, from long experience of the
advantages thereof ; but I'ufFered them to
graze in the fields, in feafoi:s, when fjme
times the mill dew had poisoned the
herbage. After the Silefian mode of feed
ing and faking cattle had been introdu
ced in Brandenbourg, the mortality visi
bly became less frequent, and the land
owners did not labour under so many mif
fortunes as formerly. These fails are par
ticularly recommended to the attention
of the inhabitants, of those parts of Ca
lolina and Virginia, which have fuffered
many years, and continue to fuffer,
from the great mortality among their
cattle.
In a pnrt of Brandenboutg and Porfie
ranin, there we" krg- f of high
lands, diflant from rivers and rivulets,
which consequently could not be watered, <
and therefore wanted palturage, and the
ilrength of foil necessary for cultivation, i
This was rather a local defed than one
arising from want of induflry in the pro
prietors ; and though man is not permit- <
ted to change the nature of things, the
king thought proper to direCt some at
tempts, that experience might teach, what
was, and what was not, practicable. For
this purpose he had recourse to an Eng
lift farmer, by the aid of whom efiays |
were made on some of the royal farms, t
His method was to sow those poor and (
sandy lands with turnep feed j the turneps ,
were fuffered to rot, after which the ,
lands were sowed with clover and other (
grass feeds , and thus were transformed I ]
into artificial meadows, by the aid of 1 >
which, the number of cattle was greatly |
increased on each eflate. These experi-1 j
ments having been so fuccefsful, care was ,
taken to generalize a species of agricul
ture so advantageous, through all the pro
vinces. A great improvement to this } |
mode would be to winter feed the turnep
ground with sheep, hurdling 01 inclosing ,
them by a worm fence of light rails within ,
a space of a quarter, half or a whole acre, ,
at a time, according to the number of -
sheep ; and in the spring of the year, to
sow the ground after two good plough- ,
ings and harrowings with bailey and clo- ,
vcr feed.âTwo bufnels of barley to the .
acre ; and after it is up, to one, two or ]
three inches, sow eight pounds of clover
feed or more peracrerollingthe clover feed ,
in if convenient. The earlier you can sow |
your barley in March, April or May, (ac- ,
cording to the season and climate) the '
better ; provided your ground be fuffici- (
ently dry for ploughing. After yourccl- t
ver has been in one, two or three years, ,
the ground will bear a good crep of wheat i
or rye, which should be sowed on a fingie i
furrow or ploughing, in September, liar- ,
rowing the grain in, lengthways, and not t
cross ways of the furrow. Then turn
the stubble in with the plough as soon t
after harvefl as you can, and the next sea- [
son low the ground with turneps as before, I
after ploughing the ground and cross t

ploughing, so much the betterâ-This
completes what is called a cojrfe of crops.
Take care not to sow Clover on ground
f that lies wet in winter and not to impove-
I rifh your ground by covetously feeding
I your clover too doleâWhen this mode
? of farming orcourfeof crops shall be ge
â¢ nerally adopted on the worn out lands
in Virginia, infinite advantage! will be c!e

equal to the consumption of all America;

and the paorelt of their lands may be
made more profitably productive, than the
belt lands in Kentucky* where many of
their bed citizens are emigrating to. Let
every gentleman farmer in Virginia, en
close ten acres, make a fair expeiiment,
keep an exaCl and candid journal of his
management, and the issue of his experi

cannot do a greater public good ; to en

in each of their trading towns to import
from Philadelphia or New England, the
necefTary turnep, clover and barley, for
feed immediately. Clover feed m y behad
there, generally, at I-8 of a dollar per lb.
barley at 6s. per bullitl, and turnep feed
for a trifle.

Original letter from the Hon. JEdanus Burke,
chief jujfrce of the Jlate of v ou<h Caroli
na, to the Rev. Ezra Stiies, 1). D. Pre-
Jident of Tale College.
Philadelphia, September I i, t 702.
Dear Sir,
SINCE I had the pleasure to fee you,
I have often re9eÂ£ted on the hard fate of
Generals Whalev & Goffe, and Col. Dix
well, three of those patriotic republicans,
who fat as judges on the trial of king
Charles the firlt. I confid r the decisive
heroic spirit of that daj, which dared to
bring kingly despotism to public juflice,
as nearly relate.: to that spirit of kindred
boldness, which lately in America anima
ted our citizens to oppose regal oppression, '
and efFeCted our independence. Nor do
I think the less of the patriots of 164.8,
because they failed of success. The peo
ple of Britain went back to the flefh pots
of Egypt, and relapsed into all the servi
tude of the old monarchy, because the
world was not fufficiently enlightened to
avail themselves of events. The princi
ples of government, and the rights of man
not being well understood, lay prostrate
under the fatal prejudices of the times, and
a superstitious idolatry for the name of a
king.
But the wretchedness of the old world
ought not to extinguish our reverence for
the memory of Whaley, Goffe, and Dix
well, who lie buried in New-England.
Those gallant men flood forth for the
canfe of liberty, in dark, dismal times, in
the parliament army. They were eye
witnesses of all the miseries, of the infi
nite Daughter on the field and fcaffold,
with the total ruin of families, which ii
was the lot of that country to fuffer from
the tyranny of their king.
Their story, and the diftreffe3 which
they fuffered in America, are known to
but very few. To think of the tedious lire
long nights and days of sixteen or seven
teen years through which they pined in
concealment and distress. hunted as they
were by the hues and cries, and purfui.

i vants of k:,lg Charles the second ! It is
hardly poll-ble that their fate can be a
matter of i .difference to any man whose
head orha-d held a share in our late glo
rious revof.ition. For had the republi
(fans of At.-rrica failed, as those of Britain
did, our iilt llrious Washington, Hancock,
and Samiii 1 Adams, with the red of our
gallant pa/riots, would have been hunted
down by uyail proclamations and pur
suivants, a t), like the ill fated Whaley,
Git, ano: Diiwell, without a place to
lay their b ids, or a friend to.give them a
morsel of ~read, but with terror of his
life. Peace be to the fiiadeS of the wor
thy piefby erian clergyman, who afforded
those unlu.ppy patriots shelter and protec
tion from j-.ingly vengeance ! It does high
honor, irÂ» my opinion to the people of
New England, and, it would aJd to the
l'iftre of it, if yourfelf, Mr. Pierpont
Edwartfs, and the other citizens of New
haven, who have hitherto been guardians
of DixweH's allies, would zealously under
take the railing of a final! monument to
the memory of those three rtHS.I with a
plain claffieal inscription in Englilli. If
wouid be doing iomething more than re
cording the republican principles and
goodneis of heart which diitinguifhed
your ancestors : Such a monument, Sand
ing in front of your college, where Dix
well lies, would be to the youth a good
lesson and conspicuous example, that the
fame of brave men, who und'ergo hazards
and fuffer In (he cause of public freedom,
is not to pcrifh utte.ly .' though the world
and its affairs may change ; though ge
nerations of men, and years, and ages may
pass awÂ» , yet, after all, a rewarding pro
vidence may, out of some circumltance or
other, produce a refurredlion to their re
putation, and guard it from oblivion
I have to offer an apology for anti
cipating sentiments, which I am persua
ded rnuft have frequently impressed your
mind, glowing as it is, with a fervent'love
of liberty under a republic. With prin
ciples like these, I think, it is impossible
for a man to behold DixweH's grave with
out veneration for his memory, and wish- ]
es, that some such plan could be exeeU- ,
ted. If you will undertake the business i
so far as to give it an origin in Newha- i
ven, lam persuaded you need not fear ,
for the execution of it. In Philadelphia ,
alone, the materials could be filrnifhed, ,
and sent round by water, with an artill i
to set up the work. But lam one who i
would be for not allowing that city alone '
to monopolize the merit of it. There are !
in Bolton. Newhaven, New-York, and i
other parts of America, republicans who
would wish for the honor wf participating
in the promotion of it.
As I am to leive town to-morrow, and
set off for Carolina, if you address an |
answer tothisletter to chief justice M''
Iveart, he will o' r >en a communication with
you on the fubjedl. That gentleman
with the Rev. Dr. Ewing, and some other
worthy men here, wiil proceed to adl as
soon as you originate the business.
That you may live long, and enjoy all
the blessings which talent 3, learning, and :
virtue ought to bellow on yoti, is my ,
sincere wish.
I have the honor to be, with great
esteem.

PLAN OF DEFENCE
AGAI N S T
THE TYRANTS.
From a Paris paper.
The important queflion of the moment
is to determine, whether the duke of
Brunfwick will reach Paris.
Those who fay he will, are the aristo
cratic party, who most ardently desire it,
and the minds who fear his approach, relt
[Total No. 118.]
! their argument on his great military ta'
' sent ' s ; on his having a cool head, fit for
: grand calculations.
1 'icy assert, he has a w-ell dicrefted planj
that the French have none ; that he has
an army of veterans ; and that we have
only a number of raw, undifcipli'ned fol
dierj ; that he receives regular intelligence
from our garrifous and armies : that the
desperate emigrants under his command
will form a nucleus, around which all the
malcontents of the kingdom will gather;
that as soon a? two places are taken, it
will be impoffiblc to oppose an army of
100,000 men marching in three columns,
with its own garrilons behind it, and the
Austrian forces laying watte all the coun
try on their march ; disarming the patri
ots to arm the malcontents ; witti light
troops in their van, to kill, plunder, Vied
burn; and onclude by taking poffefiiohr
of our most advantageous p-.fts, so as to
cut off provilions from Paris, and reduce
it by famine.
Those who maintain (and think with
most probability) that Brunfwiek will not
be rjfr enough to {hut up himlelfand ar
my in France, observe that the Pruflnns
can only occupy a certain space of the
country ; tnat if they bring with
them mere neceflaries for ?.n army of
100,000 men, their march must be irate
rialiy retarded : th3t should they

toad, he have only to set fire to every
thing p r eviouS to their arrival, and deva't
all Champaign : to summon in progrelfi
on all the citizens of France towards the
relief of the capital : that, all the depart
ments being armed, it will be proper to
let Lrunfivick- ddvar.ee fm-cftcagh to-fi.r
round him ; and that, by taking pofftflioa
of ail the advantageous posts, it will be ail
eaf> matter to deilroy all his men fuccef
lively, without riiking a b .tile : that as
loonashe has got about 20 leagues into tlifl;
country, we (hall (lop up every avenge
of fubliftence, andtlarvehim in his camp :
and all the ttray soldiers killed will be
carefu ly concealed, in order that the de
leterious effluvia ariling fro.n them may

the fiiends of liberty argue, that 110 armr
can hold a durable looting in an enemy's
country ) to fay nothing of the aftonifliino
efforts and enthuliafm of patriotic soldi
ers, which are unknown to mercenary
troops inured to flaverv ; and, to oppose
plan to plan, and defeat artifice by arti
fice, the bravo partisans of fair freedom
fuggelt the following series of operati
ons.

In the mean time all the aristocrats are
to be secured, disarmed, and confined.
The next step is, if pollible, to enter Bra

Care must be taken to man the garri

A SUGGESTION. t
IT was an ancient proverb "that he c
th-at invented means whereby he could y
cause two spears of grass or corn to grow, Â£
where but one would hitherto grow, de- t
served more from his country than all the (
heroes and politicians of the age"âWhy : j
âBccaufe it is on the produce of the earth .
that we fubliit. Should not America a
dopt the following proverb, viz. He that ,
invents improvements on any art, whereby (
one man caii do as much as two men could (
hitherto do, deserves more honor and fa- .
vor from his country, than any two heroes ,
or politicians âWhy ?âBecaufe there is
so great a want of men in our country, ;
that we cannot extend om' manufactures, (
nor fully cultivate our lands. And because (
it is to the arts that we are indebted for
all the conveniencies and luxuries of (
even molt of t'le ufeful productions of the
earth. Deprive us of the arts, and We !
immediately relapse into a savage state.â :
To the arts we are indebted, for our fine
farms, and plentiful harveltsâline (hips, :
andextenfive commerce âfine apparel and '
easy carriagesâfine, convenient and com
fortable hjafes, andgreat&populous cities.
âShould not a wife nation nurse and cul
tivate them, by granting them all poflible
aid and encouragement, feeing that with
out them nine-tenths of us would inevita
bly perish, for want of neceflaries of life,
and the remainder be in a worse iituation
than the untutored savage of the woods.
As the precious metals and (tones, are hid
in tlie oowels of the earth, and are with
much difficulty, labor, andexpencebrought
forth and poliihed and refined for lifeâfo
hath nature file!" the ufeful arts, that it is
only him, that fearcheth and diggeth with I
diligence, & unwearied perseverance, that I
fhaiT find them. Therefore who is more
worthy to be honored, and esteemed by his
country, than he who fearcheth cut their
fee. t hiding places in nature, and bringeth
them forth to the aid and alliltance of rpnff.
To whom are we indebted for th' l '. great
service ? To the great and noble of the
earth ? âNo ! Those things are mostly re
vealed to the humble, diffident and modest;
and they have moltly been of but low cir
cirnltances that have ever invented any
thing ufeful, because they are men that
prefer knowledge to riches. And hence
their greatest difficulty is, after they have
invented an improvement to bring it forth
into practice. Therefore, it is the inte
-1 tof a nation not only to secure to the
inventor (for a limited time) the exclusive
right to liis invention after he has brought
it into u(e, but to afflft him in bringing it
into practice, if he cannot do it himfelf :
Because. what profit is it to a nation if a
mine of gold be discovered, if it never be
ope led ?â he discoverer declareth that
he hath found a mine of goldâbut 110 one
will believe him, so far as to affilt him to
open it, till they fee and feel the pure me
tal. If he goes to work alone, and neg
lects to p.ovide food and raiment for his
family, will not they starve with hunger
and cold before he can attain his end, by
the tedious and expensive process -.âwhen
he findeth want pinching, he is forced to
give oil! iii- pursuit, and is laughed at, and
all men agree that there is no mine there,
and no one will attempt it again for a cen
tury âHow often hath this been the cafe 1
I am of opinion that no nation hath yet
hit on the mot effectual means ol pro
moting the progress of ufeful arts. They
have said to the inventor---Produce us the
pure gold from the mine, and we will Je
cure to you the right of getting all you can
for fourteen yearsâWhereas, they should
have said âShew us the place where the
gold is, and convince us by good reajons that
it is probably there, andwe will all come and
helb you a day to dig it out, andyou Jhall then
have all you can get for fourteen years; you
must however, pay us for our labor. But
if you and we jiiould alike be mistaken, it
will be no great lojs to usâpay us when
you can.âlf our Congress should adopt a
patent system on such principles, I dare
venture to fay, that the ufeful arts would
flourifh in this country, with a growth un
paralelled in the history of nationsâAnd
â¢ as wealth and power is the offspring of
art, we would in time be able to dictate to
the world. Suppose, for instance, that a
sum only equal to one fourth part of the
savings of one improvement, that is alrea
dy brought forward (the inventor having
luckily been able to reduce it to practice)
viz.âMr. Oliver Evanses improvement
on the art of manufacturing wheat into
flour. I have read a pamphlet wrote on
thejuftice, policy, and utility, of establish
ing an effectual patent system, for promot
ing ufeful arts ; and although I do not a
gree with the author exaCtly, I find he hath
made appear that Mr. Evans's improve
ments may, in time, save the labor of 4000
men, in this country, which, calculated at
200 dollars each, is 800,000 dollars per an
num. But to speak altogether within
bounds, fays he, it will soon save the labor
of 1000 men,which at foo dols. each, makes
100, coo dollars, per annum ; one fourth
part of which would be fufficient for a loan
to be established for the promoting of ufe
ful arts. I conceive that the whole conti
nent of Aiilerica cannot produce 25 real
inventive geninfes, or as many as could
come forward with2s inventions annually,
fufliciently,probable of utility and fuccels
to merit the alliltance of the loin ; and I
conceive that. 1000 dollars would bffuffi
cient for experiments on moll inventions.
And as all that were fuccefsful could pay
back the money, andperhapsmany of those
that were unfuccefsful, âtherefore it might
be expected that such an institution would
be but a very small expence to the public,
and of great utility.
I cannot refrain hoping that some such
measure will be adopted, because I know
of I'evaral ufeful dilcoveries, that now lay
dormant for want of such alliltance, and
are in danger of being buried with the in
ventors. But if the alliltance be granted,
I lhall hope to live to fee the day when our
harvests w ill be reaped and threlhed by ma
chines moved by the strength of horles ;
our rooms in cities warmed with halt the
present expence of fuel ; and the power
of elastic fleam applied to move saws and
plaining machines, whereby much oi the
laborious parts of the work of carpenters
in building lioufes will be done by that
power, and perhaps even applied to the
propelling of tandcarriages with heavy bur
dens. I know persons that propose all
these inventions (and not without great
probability of fticcefs) as that great power
of Iteam may be applied to mar,y things to
which it has not yet been applied.
Why would we expect an inventor to
make improvements at an expence perhaps
equal to all that he is worth, when he is to
enjov it only fourteen years? What tenant
will improve a farm at his own expence,
when he is to poUefs it only that time â
If the public is to be the proprietor at the
end of the aforefaid patent term, why
not pay the expence of the experiments i
âThe very hopes or expectation of a pa
| tent will cause the inventor to keep his
! discovery a profound secret (if he is not
able at present to reduce it to practice, and
take out the patent) until he or iiis chil
dresihall be able to reduce itto practice, &
* pay the patent fees; and herein appears
the ill effeÂ£ts of that ungenerous policy,
of taxing genius by taking large patent
fees. I believe that agreat majority of the
people are in favor of patents, efpeciallv
amongst the ruling part, as hath appeared
in several inltances ; it is only a few unge
nerous, and consequently unpopular cha
racters, that are opposed thereto. But it
appears that Congress hath hitherto consi
dered the patent law, as an unimportant
object, not worthy of that attention that
other more important objeCts demand.â
When we conlider, however, that the
wealth, power, and happiness of p nation,
is always in proportion to the perfection
of the arts in that nation ; and that the
perfection of the arts is always in propor
tion to the encouragement they meet with,
surely it is evident that there never was,
nor can appear, a more important objeÂ£t
before Congress.

To the Editor of the National Gazette.
> SIR,
1 I WAS much pleased with some remarks
I in your paper, entitled " Forerunners of
1 aristocracy and monarchy in the United
â  States," by a writer who ligns himfelf
! Mirabeau- His (ignature is not unworthy
t of the fnbject ; for could that great apostle
â  of liberty and equality be called again in
< to existence, and fee follies and -vices
â  springing up with a hot-bed growth in A
- merica, which finally beget tyranny, and
1 which he lent his formidable aid to expel
1 from his own country, his indignant fpi
* rit would ruih from such a scene of depra
t vity, and rather wander in a world un
<' known. That a nation just emerged from
1 despotism, where the human mind has been
fettered for ages, and where the exfercife
t of it on political quellions constituted a
f crime, fliould set an example to Ameri
-2 cans, is a subjeCt of wonder! Well may
* they feel the hard earned laurels of their
? revolution withering on their brows, before
1 the natural period of decay, when they fee
- France outstripping them in the true spirit
1 of republicanifni, and exalting the deba
f fed state of human nature. Ostentation
3 and inequality are founds as discordant to
a the ears of regenerated Frenchmen, as To
e ry was to an AmericanâTho' Mr. Mira
beau has done great justice to his subjeCt, as
I far as he has gone, I will take the liberty
to (uggeft some additional remarks which
he has, perhaps, overlooked.
The ajfumption of the titles of office by
the officers of government in social life â
This vain display of superiority, at the
fame time that it designates a little and fri
volous mind, (hews their disposition for
diflinttion and inequality. In the social
communication between man and man, the
officers of government are no more than
citizens, audit must found strangely absurd
to hear of an invitation from the " Secre
tary of War" to dine, as it might be ima
gined that his cards announced a war-feaft.
This might anfvver very well in the neigh
bourhood of the Miami village, but in the
bosom of tranquility we naturally feel a
larmed at the found of war. This rattle,
which so peculiarly delights certain cha
rafters among us, ieems to n&vejeauccu
the author of the famous defence of the
American conllitutions by its Syren founds.
He never appears but in the full blaze of
office, as if every place he went to was a
senate, and every circle which he invited
needed a Vice-Prefideht âTempora niu
tantur !
Secret deliberations of the Senate, &c â
This Patrician Itile, this concealment, this
aifeftatiori of pre-eminence but illy accords
tvith tile fpiric of a republican government.
The conftitlltion of the United States ac
knowledges no superiority ot one legisla
tive body over the other, and to ajj'ume it
is a violation of its principle, and an insult
to the character of freemen. Itisaftrange
maxim in republican policy, that the agents
of the people should keep their delibera
tions concealed from those from whom
they derive their political existence. It
augurs an unfriendly disposition in a pub
lic body that wiflies to ma/que its transac
tionsâUpright intentions, and upright con
duct are not afraid or alhained of publici
ty. The spirit of a Venetian senate suits
not, as yet, tlie meridian of the United
States ; neither does the conduct of a con
clave or a divau comport with the feelings
of Americans. _
The citizens of the United States would,
no doubt, spurn at the idea of an avowed
introduction of ariltocracy or monarchy a
mong them. The people of Rome in the
time of Caesar and Augultus were not less
averse from the title ol king, but the found
'of emperor milled them. Familiarize the
mind to the shadow of ariltocracy and mo
narchy, 1 (and this feeins to be the policy of
certain characters among us) and the fub
liance mult and will follow âl.hanges of
this kind are sometimes gradual and al
rnoft imperceptible, but are not less cer
tainâWhat the poet fays of vice may be
said of aj'iftocracy or monarchy
âis a monlter of so frightful mein,
As to be hated, needs but to be seen ;
Yet seen too oft, familiar with her face,
We fir ft f.idure. then pity f then embrace.

PARIS, September 26.
The service done to France by General
Montefuuiou in his expedition to Savoy is
of the greatelt magnitude. In his politiou
at Montmelian he can scarcely be so mnch
as attacked, owing to the natural strength
of the place, where a handful of men, with
7 or 8 cannon might defy the efforts of
40,000 of the enemy, whereas, the whole
force of the king of Sardinia does not ex
ceed 27,000 men.
The female tyrant of the north, the em
press of Russia, is always threatening us
with her fleets and armies, and is as con
ftandy humbled with a cojifcioufnefs that
neither of them can ever hurt us. Some
accountsfay that 15,000, others 20,000, and
some even fay that 30,000 Ruffians are on
their march to join the two combined ar
mies, under the Duke of Brunfwick and
the king of Prussia. It is certain, howe
ver, that these troops have not yet passed
the frontiers of, Poland ; and it may be
added that the 40,000 Ruffians actually in
that kingdom, are scarce fufficient to keep
in awe a people irritated by slavery, and
the opposed faitions which are ready to
tear each other to piecesâAs to the Ruf
fian fleet which was to have insulted our
coasts, they did indeed fail as far on their
way as Denmark, but for want of a fufli
ciency of men were obliged to return to
Cronltadt. so that they now cannot poili
bly leave the Baltic till next June.
The alliance of the two rival powers of
Auitria and Prussia, has given the inoft se
rious discontent to all the great statesmen
of the latter ; and has actually produced a
political schism in the court of Berlin, preg
nant with danger to the king, the conse
quences of which no man can pretend to
calculate. The war into which Frederick
the 3d has been drawn has created general
discontent throughout his dominions, which
is daily encreafing, and of which the explo
sion will, sooner or later, be terrible. The
nation complain that the war with France
is exhausting the treasures heaped up by
Frederic the 2d, and recruiting is become
â  so difficult, that the king cannot be fuppli-
with a reinforcement of only 30,000
men, that he has wrote for.
> If the people in general, in England and
â  Holland, are favorably disposed towards
i our revolution, it is held in detestation by
their Holland, it is true, is not ar
-1 tiling <; but she exclulively gives to our e
â  nemies every possible encourgement, re
â  fpeÂ£ting loans, the hiring of transports, and
the purchase of arms and military {lores.
â  England fitted out this year only a small
I squadron, and even that is returned to
â  port, but it does not appear that any orders
1 have been given for paying off and laying
1 up the {hips that compose it. No extraor
dinary movement has lately taken place in
the English dock yards, but then it mult be
remembered, that their navy is always in
such a state, that a powerful fleet may be
â  equipped and sent to sea in fix weeksâAs
to Spain, there is no reason to doubt of
, her enmity iince the deposition of Louis
tiie i6thj and, aitho' she cannot arm so
quick as England, we have every reason to
think she will take an active part a gain ft
us. Their army, however, in Europe
does not at this time confifl of more tharf
25,c00 men ; but their navy is on a some
thing better footing.
LONDON, October 1.
Thionville is another Gibraltar; the
Auflrians conftruftcd four large floating
batteries, which they let fall down the
Moselle ; when opposite the town, they
were received by a hot fire, so well direct
ed, that in a few minutes they were feet
all to the bottom, and every n an on board
perished. It has cost the Auftriaris about
500 men to get pofleffion of a hill v hich
commands the town. On this place they
crested eight batteries, which the garrison
I'allied forth and deitroyed. Gen. Quere
lande, who commands the siege, is tired of
pouring hot balls into the town, and hopes
only to reduce it by famine. At Montme
di, the French make as stout a reliftancÂ»;
the commander, M. de Ligneville, ha 3
been displaced, and a quarter-master of ar
tillery chosen in his Head : the garrison cf
Thionville have also deposed their com
mander. The refinance made by these
places flops the army from advancing.
