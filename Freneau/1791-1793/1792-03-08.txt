A division of the question being cal
led for,
The House agreed (yeas, 26 ; nays,
25) to the firft part of the report of the
committee, which, though it does not
confer any immediate benefit on Mr.
Churchman, is yet worthy of notice,
on account of a fccming connexion be
tween it and a fubjett, which lately
kept the House engaged in a warm de
bateof nearfourdays continuanceâvir.
the power of granting 'bounties' or
'allowances&c. âlt is as follows :
" The Congress of the United

enable him to prosecute his laudable en
quiries, to goodeffeft."
The yeas and nays were moved for on
this question, and some gentlemen rose in

drawn his support, the motion was with
drawn and they were not called.

agreed to, and in pursuance thereof, a com

A motion was then made by Mr.
Steele, to amend the feftion, by adding,
at the end of the lift of exempts, a
rlaufe to the following effett :â" and
dll others who may have been exemp
ted by laws heretofore pal Ted within
their refpeftive states."
It was here observed, that some states
have as yet no militia laws, and conse
quently have not had an opportunity of
making ' heretofore' such exemptions, as
may however be thought proper when
they come to pass such laws.
Mr. White thought there was no ne
cessity of particularizing the laws' al
ready past but that it would be better
to leave the matter open to the discre
tion of the state legislatures by simply
faying " all persons exempted by the
laws of their refpeftive states."
Mr. Steele's amendment was amend
;d and agreed to, as follows :â" and all
persons, who now are, or hereafter may
exempted, by the laws of their ref
peftive states."

members of both Houses of Congress,
ivith their refpe&ive officers," were
idded to the lift of exempts.
Mr. J. Smith moved to strike out all
he different officers of the state govern
ments, thinking it better to leave to the
iifcretion of the state legislatures the
exemption of such of their own officers
as they may think proper.
The motion was carried ; Yeas
24 ; Nays, 12.
Mr. Boudinot moved to add " all

Mr. Gerry called up his motion sot
the appointment of a committee, tr
bring in abill to reduce the rates of pof
tagc on newspapers ; âwhereupon,
An honorable member observed, thai
as the rates had not crept into the bill
by chance or oversight, but after ma
ture deliberation and discussion, a haft)
repeal of that part of the law, before ex
perience has shewn its operation,woulc
betray in the government a want of fta
bility which might be attended witl
consequences worse than the worst tha
could be apprehended from the law ir
Us present form.
Stability '{it wÂ«*s is inueec
honorable to government as well astc
individuals, âbut it is liability in wil
dom, not (lability in error :âif the rate:
of postage appear unreafonablv high
and likely to prove burdensome, tht
burden ought to be lightened, withou
waiting till experience should afcertair
its precise weight.
Already (it was said) its injurious ef
fefts begin to be felt:âthe readers o
newspapers have begun to stop then
fubferiptions :âcomplaints come for
ward from the constituents to their re
prefentative, that a monopoly is grantee
to negligence.
The rates of poftageimpofedon news
papers were pronounced to be so high
as to amount to a prohibition : âan ex
tensive and minute establishment of
post-roads had been gone into :âman)
of these cannot be supported by the or
dinary conveyance of letters ; and if the
newspapers are, by too high a tax, ex
cluded from the mails, these roads can
not be supported at all : âA reduction oi
the postage, to half the rate established.
would yield a greater profit.
The question being taken on the re
solution, and having passed in the af
firmativeâ(yeas 27 ; nays ( not counted
about seventeen) âMr. Gerry, Mr. Mui
ray, and Mr. Findley were appointed :

Mr. Barnwell, for the purpose (as he
alledeed) of leaving the states at liberty
to train their refpe&ive Militia oftener
than is prescribed by the Bill, moved
for the insertion of an additional lecti
on, as follows :
" And be it further enacted, That no
thine in this act shall be conflrued to
prevent any state from eftabhfhing
such further regulations, for more ef
fectually training their militia, accor
ding to the foreigning rules of discipline,
as the Legislature thereof lhall think
proper."
" Mr. Livermore recommended to
the honorable gentleman to tack the fol
lowing proviloto his section, in cafe
he wiihed it to pais : â¢ â¢
"Provided that this ast, or any clause
or feftion therein contained, fhaii not
abridge the authority of the particular .
states, in training their militia according
to the discipline hferein prescribed â.
This (he said) would be paying some
little refpeft to the authority of the
states ; and would shew to the public,
that Congress do not mean to counter
act the constitution.

or as nearly thereto as circumstances
will admit, and to train, exercise and
discipline them in manner directed ,by
law, excepting as to the place, which
lhall always be at the works or manu
factories, and excepting the meetings
in regiment or battalion, in lieu of
which they shall meet in companies at
the said works and manufactories in
manner aforefaid. And the said work
men, manufacturers, and laborers lhall
be excused from all other militia duty,
except in times of invasion or insurrec

" And be it farther enabled That the
Commander in chief of each, state shall,
on the requisition of the President of
the United States, authorized thereto
by the express aCts of Congress, order
out any proportion of the militia of
the state, so required as aforefaid, to
march to any part of the United State*for the protection or c'efencc of the fame ;
provided that they be not compelled to con
tinue on duty out of the state, without their
content, for a longer time than. months,
at any one time that, while in actual

From the American Daily Advertiser ofMonday lajl,
Mr. DunlAp,
IT has been a well known trick with corrupt
clergy, when their evil ways have been
pointed out and reproved, to call it an attack on
religion, made by its secret enemies. So it
seems to me to be the policy of some who come
forward in answer to ftriflures of the press, on
certain public measures and proceedings, to
brand it as a design to overturn the government.
The trick, however, is too stale to pass. When
it is seen and known to the people, that the
members of the government, and the few favor
ed by them, have been the greatest gainers by
all the measures of the government, there mufi
be good proof to the contrary, before the peo
ple will believe that all has been right, and that
the cry that the government is attacked, and in
danger, is not raised by the craft who are alarm
ed tor themselves at the spirit of enquiry and the
voice of truth, which have come forth. Prudent
people will rather therefore become more suspi
cious when they hear these appeals from the me
rits of the business to their fears and their sup
posed prejudices. God forbid it ffiould turn
out that there be any such among us as wilL to
dellroy the government by faflions and intrigues.
I hope there may be none such. But if there
be, is there not more jull ground tofufpeft those
who unceasingly praise and puff all the public
measures which tend to raise the few into a splen
did opulence, and to generate monarchial and
corrupt principles and habits, rather than those
who feel disgust at these perversions of the go
vernment, and, in their alarm for liberty and

the State of South-Carolina, as taken by my Afliftants. Given

R HUGE R, Fed. Marjhal.
republican systems, give too flrong vent perhaps
to their indignation.âFor my part, I do veiily
believe, that the former alone are to be dreaded.
There never yet was a good government pulled
down by freely and boldly taxing its proceedings:
whereas arbitrary governments have been often
built up by varnishing iheir doings, and free
ones turned into arbitrary ones, by blindly fub
mitiing to the gradual change brought about by
abuses of power, and the subtle workings of
the enemies to the popular rights.
Let those who deny that abuses have prevail
ed, and even corruption, come forth and appeal
to the true tefl. Let Jails bring in the verditf.
Ourprelent worthy Governor, it may be re
memhered, was once attacked, with charges of
having made his fortune, by base means, out of
an office he had held. As he was innocent, his
friends didnotflifle enquiry âbut wifhedfor itâ
and he himfelf to his immortal honor, inflead of
shunning invefligation, took the mod effectual of
all fieps to clear himfelf and confound hisaceu
fersâfor he made out a schedule of his property
when he went into office, and another when he
came out, and by comparing these together (the
truth of which could be pretty well judged of
by those who knew his affairs) he fliewed that ha
had not availed himfelf of the means of pecula
tion, or official occasions, of getting rich
QueryâWhether the members of the federal
legiflatuie could fland thisffy??âAnd if it be
found that some are lich now, who were poor,
in a manner, heretofore, and that the change
has been made without any ordinary or vifiblt
means therefor, then suspicion at leaf! will ope
rate âand if no such change be found, then it
would die away, and the public be easy. But
sooner than take this course, it is more likely to
fee attempts to ridicule and burlesque the idea,
which iscommonly the refuge of those who wish
to turn the attention of the public from a sober
pursuit of fufpefled iniquity.
But if the example of our worthy Governor
be too terrible, or be otherwise obje&ionable,
ill the present cafe, let the fubferibers' names
to the bank, where the fubferibers are men who
had a hand in that work, be printed, and let it
be seen, by the faQ, whether there is ground to
fufpeft the individuals of the government of
speculating and making fortunes, in their owa
measures if it appeal, that this has been
done, every honest man will have his thoughts,
and every free man will dare to express them,
in spite of any falfc alarms of intcrcftcd men, that
the government (in reality themielves only) is
in danger. But little is such a publication to
be expefled. For besides, that disagreeable
' truths might come to light, such a proceeding
would be very popular, and it is the fajhion now
a-days to despise popularity.

March 8, 1792.
Proposals are advertised to be received
at the office of the Secretary of the Trea
sury until Wednesday afternoon the 21ft in
stant, for a large quantity of cloathing for
the troops in the service of the United
States, âviz. 4(08 hats, 4608 coats, 4608
vests, 8668 woolen overalls, 9216 linen ditto,
183-6 pairs of (hoes, 18460 lhirts, 7956
pairs of socks, 4608 blanketsâditto flocksâ
ditto stock claspsâditto pairs of buckles.
For the cavalry ; â 320 caps, 320 coats, 320
vests, 320 pairs of leather breechesâ64o
pairs of boots, 320 ditto spurs, 640 ditto
{lockings, 1280 lhirts, 320 blankets t 320
flocks, 320 stock claspsâalso 1200 rifle
lhirtÂ», to be made of RuJJia sheeting.
At a large meeting of the citizens of Al
bany, on the nomination of the Hon. Judge
Jay, and Mr. Van Renlellear, as governor
and lieutenant governor of the state of
New-York, only five votes appeared a
gainst themâthe fame unanimity in their
favour appeared in every place from
whence information had been receivedâ
an idea beginning to prevail through those
parts of the country, that rotation is
absolutely neceflary in the office of repub
, lican Governor.
Mr. Spillard the celebrated English tra
veller, arrived at Savannah, in Georgia, on
the 14th of February last. He was to leave
that city in a few days for New Orleans,
taking the Indian foot paths through the
country. At New Orleans he was to meet
Lord Fitzgerald, who was on his way there
from Quebec. They were then to pro
ceed in company up the Milfifippi to the
Miflouri, which they intended to explore
to its source, and from thence, if poliible,
travel to the head of the Oregon [or river of
the well] which falls into the south seas.
It is remarkable that so long after the
engagement with the Indians as the sth of
January (two mo the dead bodies of
the (lain were ftili untouched by wild ani
mals.âThe party that went to reconnoitre
the place, found the small arms all broken
on the field, and the bayonets thrust
through the bodies of the dead.
The latter end of January several severe
fliocks of an earthquake were felt in dif
ferent and distant parts of Jamaica. It
does not appear that any considerable da
mage has been done by these (hocks.
The plunder taken by the Indians, on the
4th of Nov. last, exclusive of arms, cloath
ing, watches, &c. is said to have been two
bushels of hard money, leven Hundred pack
horfes, and two hundred bullocks.
The packet Franklin, lately arrived at
New-\ork from L'Orient, had not forty
dayspaflage, as mentioned in several New-
York and Philadelphia papers, but was
twelve weeks and four days in reaching her
destined port. Why the French packets,
bound to this continent, have almost inva
riably much longer palfages than the heavi
est merchant ships, is not certainly known.
These veflels for the molt part are good
sailers, and well found : conjectures there
fore might be formed, either that they are
not conducted by persons well acquainted
with the northern Atlantic navigation, or,
that being scantily manned, they are obli
ged to be over-cautious as to carrying fail
during the night.
Repeated complaints appear in some of
the Boston papers, of a restless spirit among
a part of the citizens of Boston for incorpora
ting that capital, with city privileges, 8c c. Tories
are said to be at the head of the party for
incorporation. What is particularly de
signated by persons of this denomination, at pre
sent, is not expressly saidâthey are, howe
ver, (negatively) described as the friends of
aristocracy ; and in direst opposition to the
industrious tradesman, the enlightened pa
triot, and the true republican ; sticklers
for monied influence ; and such as would
prevent their poorer neighbours from rtand
ing up for equal privileges with them in
the highest acts of town governments.
The legislature of Maflachufetts have be
fore them, for consideration, the report oi
a committee appointed to enquire into the
practicability of cutting a navigable canal
between Barnftable and Buzzard's bay- - al
so, the report of another committee on the
subject of a separation of the diftrift of
Maine ; upon which they have determined
that a notification be made to ascertain the
sense of the inhabitants, whether they wili
generally agree to a separation or not. â
The report of the committee on Buzzard':-
bay canal has been since agreed to, and sent
to the upper house for concurrence.
Letters from Cape Francois inform, that
a detachment of three hundred men of the
Welsh-Irish regiment landed there on the
27th of January, together with five hundred
of the regiment of Provence, and a large
quantity of artillery, shot, and other milita
ry stores.-The ships, with fix thousand
more troops, were in fightof the island, ha
ving on board three millions (of livres) in
tended to relieve the wants of the colony.
Thirty thousand more trccps were soon
looked for. The mulattoes and negroes, as
their lad effort, had entirely burnt and ra
vaged all that highly cultivated part of Hi
fpaniola, called La Plaine, and committed
the most shocking murders.
A committee of their body, has been appoint"
by the Senate of the United Stares, to consider
the expediency of building a Light-House on
Montock-Point a dangerous projeÂ£tion of land
on the south fide of Long-Island, state of New-
York.
On the 14th of January, the anniveifary of the
Ugly Club was celebrated in Charleston (S.
C.) with all the joy and feftivity inseparable
from the occasion. WjLLIAM Price, Ffq.
was elected president for the eTifuing year. â
Numerous applications for admittance, it is
said, were made during the late year, but few
found fufficiently qualified for enrollment.
Meflieurs North and Vefey, owners of a flou
rifhing Rope Manufactory in the vicinity ol
Charleston, have unfortunately fuffered a loss of
30001. sterling, by their buildings taking fire on
the 20th of January, wherein was a large quan
tity of cordage, hemp, yarn, &e. which wereaU
most entirely con fumed.
On the 26th of the fame month, in Charles
ton, a house narrowly escaped being consumed
by means of a globular decanter, which had been
accidentally placed in a window fronting the
south. The rays of the fun pafling through the
decanter, colle&ed to a focus, and set fire to a
mahogany flab, which instantly kindled into a
blaze; but was discovered in time to prevent
further mifchief.
The total number of the inhabitants of South
Carolina, according to the laftcenfus, is 249,073*
Dedu&ing from this number two-fifths of the
slaves, according to the rule prescribed in the
constitution, and there wiH remain 206,236,
which number will, according to the ratio ol
30,000 eftabhfiied in the bill row pending,
entitle South Carolina to fix representatives, and
leave a surplus of 26,236.
Tranjlated extract of a letter from France, Dec. 1.
" It is the general opinion of people of dis
cernment here, that all the powers of Europe
are at this moment aftinga hypocritical par t to
wards Prance. Hardly a doubt exists, with the
better informed, that the ex-pnnces are more or
less aflifted by these powers with money, and
even encouraged to try their fortune in the inva
sion of their native country in the spring. This
idea, and this only, accounts for the obftinatc
opposition of the princes, and their refufal to
return into the kingdom, which might, if not
thus supported, be justly denominated rashness,
desperation and madness. An opinion exists
throughout Europe, with regard to France, a
good deal like that which prevailed in Er.glancl
Tvirti refpeft to America, during the whole of
the unfortunate war between the mother country
and the then colonies ; that is, that the greater
part of the people were difaffe&ed to the ufurpea
government, and were only waiting a powerful
support to declare themselves and rejlore the old do
mination.âThe European poweis, it is thought,
will in this affair a6l towards the princes much
in the manner France did towards America â
(not, 1 hope, with similar success) âThey will be
supported in a private manner, will be urged on
to invade France, and if they should then be
oined by those innumerable hosts, those irrita
ted millions, who, it is pretended, are groaning
under the tyranny of those ambitious dema
gogues, the national afTcmbly and their adherents:
the emperor, and the reft of them, will then
throw off tne masque, and immediately re-esta
blish despotism. 1 here is no Joubt that they all
reckon France too great an objcfcl to be loft tc
the common cavfe 9 if there be a poftibility tc
prevent it; and they well know, that if France
does really become the freeft kingdom in Eu
rope, her freedom will as naturally in a short
time pervade the other parts, in the fulleft ex
tent ot the word, as water finds its level. With
regard to an irwafion of the eastern frontieis,
it is therefore more than probable it will be made
in some force, with a view to feel the pulse ol
the nation. 1 hat it will not succeed is morally
certain to every man who travels through the
kingdom, as I have done, and is not blinded by
prejudice, the nation being now determined and
unanimous, and the great reservoir of the baft
blcod exported into Germany. The Pope has
loft Avignon, Carpentras, and the territory Ve
naiffen, a delightful fertile country in the midfi
cf'France, formerly gifted to the Pope by a
worthless monarch, and now resumed into the
hands of the people, to whom these provinces
justly belong."
Extract of a letter from Cape Francois,
dated 6th Feb. 1792, received by the
Brig Hetty, Capt. W. Davis.
%i We have at last the pleasure to advise
you, that rioo men are arrived from
France, & will be followed \vith49oo more :
these forces would have been here sooner
but the transports were ordered to if op
at Cadiz to take up a sum of money for
government. This arrival keeps up our
spirits : it was high time to flop the mur
ders of the mulattoes at the South part ol
chis Island. The AfTembly sent immedi
ately 400 men to the Cayes St. Louis,
where the mulattoes ast in a horrid man -
ner. It has always been told, that in the
whole there are 18000 destined for our as
sistance ; but we begin to doubt it will be
too extensive, and very sorry to add, in
Come regard too lite, the negroes having
destroyed this last month a vast quantity
of plantations, and put fire to the ripe fit
gar canesâthe only hope left to the plant
ers entering again on their property, tc
make a final! revenue to live on.

The agricultural society of Paris have
not contented themselves with barely re
commendinggood books on the fubjeft of agri
culture to those engaged in the cultivatior
of lan l : They have formed an affoclatior
of people who have fubferibed 300 livref
or 60 dollars each for printing good ele
mentary works on agriculture, ori a plan i'c
economical, that they may be fold at half
the uf'ual price. One of the aflbciation ha;
undertaken to print them for the price oi
the labour and materials. The capital be
ing returned by the sale of the books, wil
serve always for the fame purpofe.âTlu
common class of farmers, it is observed, di
not read, not from want of inclination, but
on account of the h'gh price of the general
ity of agricultural books. Such as the)
can get for nothing they read with avidity.
A friend to mankind would therefore ima
gine, that by reducing good works on agri
culture to a price within the reach of tht
less wealthy class of farmers, at a time
when the periodical papers have renderec
them fond of reading, it would not be dif
ficult to eradicate prejudices, convey ti

[Price Three Quarters of a Dollar.']ON TREES in CITIES.
A Citizen may be termed an artificial being,
as both his residence and means of life are
the peculiar effedt of art. The very ground he
walks upon is not that which nature traced out.
it is on the contrary a pavement, made with great
care and expence j and his profpedts, instead of
being bounded by the works of nature, are com
monly limited by a brick wall, a steeple, and
ths fcirefome uniform regularity of a street.
Long habit, or necefiity, can alone reconcile a
man to a city life j the savage, and even the ci
vilized rustic, revolts at the idea, and pities the
mechanic, the shopman, or still more refpe&a
ble characters, for being immersed amidst smoke,
foul air, and other squalid appendages of a large
town, without perhaps the power of removing
therefrom.
Even those, however, who seem to have be
come reconciled to a city lire, have their fits of
disgust at being thus penned up, and, if they can
any way afford it, at Jeaft once a year play tru
ant, and gratify themselves with the rude and na
tural scenes of the country.
A city, then, being the constrained residence of
so many thousands of men, what wonder that
they have not, generally, taken more pains to
transplant the imitative works of nature (such as
a row of fine trees) through the tedious uninter
rupted sameness of an extended street. ! â
Legislatures and city corporations have ever
been inimical to trees in cities.âAbout nine years
ago the attempt was made in Philadelphia to cut
down all the treesâthe public, however, demurred
to the decree, which, together with Mr.Hopkinfon's
Columnal Orator, saved the lives of thele ufefu!
andaraufing companions.â
In a neighboring city, a similar attempt was
made about a year ago by its corporation. A
universal extirpation was ordered, without refpefl
to age or quality, by the ioth of June, 1791.â
The public interfered in this, as in the other cafe,
and the trees were saved ; X e* ce pt a ew > which
having been injudiciously placed, above a centurj
ago, had nearly grown into the inhabitants' hous
es ; and consequently fufFered the sentence of th<
law. â Trees in towns are conducive to health a
well as convenience ; they please the eye, obftrufl
the burning rays of the summer fun, and impart,
in some degree, the bleflings of rural life, to hiir
who is confined to the counter, the {hop-boaidj
and other sedentary employments in a large city.
\ A Ccpy of vcrfes, on this occasion, were as follow
THE LANDLORD'S SOLILOQUY.
A MAN that own'd some trees in town,
(And much averse tb cut them down)
Finding the Law was full and plaiu,
No trees Ihould in the streets remain,
One evening seated at his door,
Thus gravely talk'd the matter o'er :
" The fatal day, dear trees, draws nigh,
When you must, like your betters, die,
Must die ! â And every leaf shall fade
That many a season lent its (hade,
To drive from hence the summer's heat,
And make my porch a favorite feat.
" Thrice happy age, when all was new
And trees untouch'd, unenvied grew,
When yet regardless of the axe,
They own'd no law, and paid no tax j
The shepherd then at ease was laid,
Or walk'd beneath their cooling fliade ;
From (lender twigs a garland wove,
Or trae'd his god within the grove ;
Alas ! those limes are now forgot,
An iron age is all our lot :
Men are not now what once they were,
To hoard up gold is all their care :
The busy tribe old Plutus calls
To pebbled ftieetsand painted walls;
Trees now to grow, is held a crime,-'
And these must perilh in their prime !
" The trees that once our fathers rear'd,
And even the plundering Briton fpar'd,
When (hivering here full oft he flood,
Or kept his bed for want of wood---
These trees, whose gently bending boughs
Have witnelYd many a lover's vows,
When half afraid, and half in jest,
With Nature busy in his bread,
With many a iigh, beftow'd in vain,
Beneath these boughs he told his pain,
Or coaxing here his nymph by night
Forfock the parlour and the light,
In talking love hisgreateft bliss
To squeeze her hand or steal a kissâ
These trees that thus have lent their (hade
And many a happy couple made,
These old companions, thus endear'd,
Who never tattled what they heard,
Must these, indeed, be kill'd so foon---
Be murder'd by the tenth of June!
" But if my harmless trees must fill,
A fortune that awaits us all,
(All, all must yield to Nature's stroke-,
And now a man, and now an oak)
Are tbcfe that round the churches grow
In this decree included too ?
Mult these, like common trees, be bled ?
Is it a crime to (hade the dead ?
Review the laiv, I pray, at lead,
And have some mercy on the priest,
Who every Sunday sweats in black
To make us steer tfie Ikyward track :
The church has loft enough, Cod knows,
Plunder'd alike by friends and foesâ
1 hate such mean attempts as theseâ
Comeâlet the parfonkeep his trees !
" Vet things, perhaps, are not so bad-â
Perhaps a rejfite may be had !
The vilest rogues that cut our throats,
Or knaves that counterfeit.our notes,
When, by the judge their sentence pafs'd,
The gallows proves their doom at last,
Villains and pests of every kind,
Tor weeks and months a rcffite find ;
And {hall such nuisances as they
Who make all honest men their freyâ â
Shall they,for months avoid their doom,
And you, my trees, in al) your bloon?,
Who never injured Imall or great;
Be murder'd at so short a date !
(< Ye men of law, the occasion feire
And name a counsel for the trees â
Arrest of judgment, firs, I pray j
Excuse them till some future day :
The trees that such a nuisance are
Next New-Year we can better spare,
To warm our shins, or boil the potâ
The law, by then y will be forgot."

Mr. Freneau,
I Happen to be one of those odd kind of people wh<
stile themselves philosophersâ&, let me tellyoi
was just about throwing your paper (No. 36) int<
the fire, when I read the following paflage in it
" The pra&ice of killing the bees when you tak<
their wax and honey, is not so cruel as it may ap
pear on the firft view, to persons of great human
ity. The life of the bee is naturally but short
and with the best management, they must pass but
an uncomfortable winter, after they are robbed o;
their provision"âAnd why ? because, " there car
be no great purpose answered in prelerving tht
bees when their food is taken away; for in theft
ciicumftances they require more care and atten
tion than the farmer can bestow, to preserve their
from perishing."âAlas ! alas ! the tender mer
cies of the wicked are cruelâThis is worse thar
opening the goose to get the golden eggsâFor ii
the bee is to be destroyed because it's life is short,
and it can pass but an uncomfortable winter, &c.
I know of many bipeds, who ought to be sent tc
right the Indians every year on the fame principle,
Did this writer never he,ar of the Rev. Mr. Wild
man, as well as of Mr. Shoemaker and Mr. Lu
pins ?âHe had better have gone on conveying
these ufeful infers from Achaia to Atticaâor tc
Beauce or into the Gatinoisâthan thus to shorter
the short existence of so valuable a creature.
I could hardly help fmUing, too, to read youi
next column 5 where some poor prejudiced philo
fopher, like myfelf, has been endeavoring to ex
:ite our humanity in favor of the black bipeds :
set of animals, surely not more ufeful than th<
joor bee j and notwithstanding the foolifh reafon
ngs of many, who call themselves Christians, the
legroes can be no better than the beeâindeed thev
ire worse, for they are lazy, proud, and revenge
ful 5 the bee is only the last j and the negroes
tan never be called men in America, where al
who have a claim to this title are free and equal
Thus reason the politiciansâThe Chriftiau (l\
:a!!ed) must have been well convinced that tht
ilack animal has no foul $ for sUrely he would no
nake a beast of a brother.
But where am 1 wanderingâl must stop, or ]
hall soon be in the lituation of many writer?, whe
ire so lengthy, they are never readâOne thought,
lowever, I must drop before I conclude j whict

An old Prophecy.
ABOUT the year 1792, the people of thelTni
:ed States (hall offer a curious phenomenon to th
eye of the worldâA whole nation
ind that too a republic, in the morning of thei
;lory, smitten with the love of gold !
And the phiiofophers and patriots of Europe fha!
Lear thereof, and like the penitent nobles of Ni
leveh, shall cover themselves with sackcloth ant
ifhes, and fend meflengers to enquire into th
taufe thereof.
And these mefiengers shall return for answer
that the United States pofl'efs many wife and vir
tuous citizens who love their country, and indivi
dually despise gold ; among other*, one that pre
fides over their treasury department $ but that thi
>reat minister seems not to be so fkilful in th
science of human nature as his genius and phi
lanthropy deserveâhence all his schemes an
plans have tended and tended only to meliorat
the pockets, and not the heads and hearts of th
jeopleâthat he has talked to them so much 0
mpofts, and of funds, and of banks, and of ma
lufa&ures, th*t they are confiaered as the cardi
Tal virtues of the union.âHence liberty, inde
phiiofophy, and genius have bee
Truck out from the American vocabulary, an
:he hieroglyphic of money inserted in their stead
is a symbol of every thing worthy the eftimatioi
jf man.
That the gangrene thus began at the heart 0
their constitution, though spreading too fact to
wards the extremities by the adliviry of its own 1/i
us, is yet about to be inoculated into the diftan
'imbsj and this, as is pretended, will save the bo
Jy from mortification and from death !
That poverty, though dignified by the pure;
virtue, is every where considered as the sum of a
"vil : hence all the ordinary walks of industry be
to be loathed, and are about to be abandone
or the golden dreamt of J"peculation ; and. notwith
landing the wonted lupciiority of agriculture ii
the opinion of the wife and good, the phrase e< lo*
voice of the unmcmied farmer," is here considered a
the emphatic description of misery and contemp
âThat elevation, therefore, of foul, which, du
ring their unequal conflict with Britain, raifc.
them to a sublimity of chara&er, which excitei
che envy and admiration of the world, has yieldec
co the contagion of avarice, and they are nov
funk into all the meanness of stock jobbing.
They are also become liars, and hypocrites, anc
calumniators of the little virtue and merit whicl
is left among them, for they fay, that the Secreta
ry of the Treasury and those who adopted his plan
in Congress, intended thereby (t amonied arifioct a
cy, and a government of influence j" whereas thci
crime was, a too good opinion of the fetife am
virtue of their countrymen, whose exceflive ava
rice, they did riot fore fee, was like the grave,
which will never cry enoughâYet these diabolical
ravens beset their state governors, and demand
that they should follow the examples of the go
vernment, which, in the fame breath, they have
traduced.
The people of this country, notwithstanding,
affedt to be still enamoured of all the virtues of re
publicanism, wonder that any one can fufpedt them
of a departure from their pristine puiity, and treat
with all the solemn indignation of speculative
treason, the labours of the patriot of Braintree,
though their conduct establishes his positions, and
accelerates his predi&ions.
That they had fought in the usual haunts of
virtue and of merit for thofc heroes and Jegifla
tors, who had conducted them through the tem
pests of anarchy, treason, and war, and had given
to their country a name among the nations j but
were told that here they were not to be found $
that the wealthy part thereof enjoyed the smiles
of the community, and might be leen in the paths
of excisemen, brokers, and (lock jobbers ; that the
reft, frowned out of focietv on account of their po
verty, and driven for lack of bread into the wil
derness, had fallen in war by the hand of the la
vages, or had a Hoc i a ted their humble dwelling
with those of the tenants of '.he sorest, as neigh
bours who, at least, would no: insult their indi
gence.
That every discoverable symptom gave mourn
ful intimation of a nation on the verge of infamy
and ruin, by reason of prosperity, without an ade
quate share of wisdom and virtue !
HATTERAS SHOALS.
AT the time of Sir Walter Raleigh's ap
proaching the American shores, the flioa!s
in the vicinity of Hatieras were found to be ex
tremely dangerous, and no vefTe 13, in that latitude,
ventured within seven leagues of the land. From
a survey of the ancient drafts of this part of the
coast, there can be nodoubt but the fears of for
mer navigators were not without foundation, as
these shoals are laid down very large in extent,
and in many places covered not with more than
five or fix feet water, at a great distance from the
land.
The constant experience of the coasting trade
Df the United states, demonstrates, either that
;he ancient drafts were purposely falfified in order
:o deter seamen from venturing too near a coast
vith which they had as yet a very (lender ac
quaintance ; or (which is the mod thai
jy the strong currents hereabouts, which aie only
ounter currents of the Gulph-Strcam, the sands,
which were originally heaped up in this part ol
;he ocean by some ancient convulsion of nature;
tiave been gradually wearing away, and diminifh
,ng to what we find them to be at this time.
At present the out-fhoals, which lie about four
reen miles south-east of the Cape, are but ol
five or fix acres extent, and where they are real!)
jangerous to veflels of moderate draught, not
more than half that number of acres. On tlu
fhoaleft part of these is, at low water, about ter
fe-et, and here at times the ocean breaks in a tre
mendous manner, fpou'ing, as it were, to the
â¢lnuds, from tba violent of the Â£ulph.
A'hich touches the ealtern edge of these banks,
: rom whence the declivity is sudden, that is u
fay, from ten fathoms to no foundings. On tht
!pot above mentioned, which is firm sand, it ha<
jeen the hard lot of many a good vefTel to strike.
in a gale of wind, and goto pieces. âIn moderatt
weather, however, these shoals may be palled over,
f necessary, at full tide,.without much danger, bj
I'elTels not drawing more than eight, nine, or ten
fee: water.
From this bank, which was formerly of vafl
extent, and called the Full-Moon-Shoal, a ridge
uns the whole distance to the Cape, about s
N. W. course : this ridge, which is about hall
i mile wide, has on it at low tide generally io, 11
and 12 feet Water, with gaps at unequal interval;
affording good channels of about 15 or 16 feet.
The moit noted of these channels, and most ulec
by coasting veflels, is about one mile and an hall
from the land, and may easily be known by <
range of breakers which are always leen, on the
weft fide, and a breaker-head or two on the eaft
;rn fide, which however are not so constant, on!)
appearing when the sea is considerably agitated,
This channel is at least two and an half mile:
wide, and might at full sea be fafely palled bj
large ships. These, however, rarely attempt it.
The common tides swell about fix feet, and al
ways come from the south-east.---A little nortl
of the Cape is good anchorage in fuur or five fa
thorns, and, with the wind to the westward, 2
boat may land in fafcty, and even bring oft'eafk:
of frefh water, plenty of which is to be foun<
every where on the beach, by digging a foot c;
two, and putting a barrel into the land.
