For the Natiosal Gazette.
Mr. Freneau,
certain, that your valuable paper
A ha-! a number of inveterate enemies;
whole molt definable obj.-ct would be to
cramp the liberties of the p?f>JÂ»W within
the narrow bound* of an obsequious auent
to every act which has the leal oft he GRKAT
affixed to it. It is no .natter of wonder
that they cry out so loudly againlt * ree "
dom of the press; for it is by it tliey re
ceive the fevcreft lathes, and which ma)
force them so bellow out. Your paper is an
enemy to despots, villains and knaves,
confeqnently, they are your gdverfar.e:
By inserting the following you will declare
war against another class oi our foes ; ant
I mod lincerely hope, that your Gazette
will, sooner or later, discover the whole
brood, and put them to a difgraceful flight.
Yours, &c. S. R.
STRUCK with the truth of that remark
which teaches us to arrange our action;
and principles in filch a manner as that all
will prove conlillent, and no particular
one will dif,:gree with its attendants, J
was led to compare my own ailions witl
the principles winch I had always imbi
bed and, through the companion, 1
found that few of my aQions prefervet
that detireable Goutiftf ncy. On the con
trary, I discovered through the genera
train ot my aflions one at variance wit I",
the other ; and the whole ot them, at war
with my principles. I was happy to fine
however, that in one important tranfaftio:]
of my life I approached nearthe re&itudt
of my breath In tiiis point, mot. ot in} fel-
Jow citizens Jiave ignorantly ftmyeet, and
acted in a manner, which, in my opinion
reftefts disgrace oil all the principles ot e
<Miaiity which they profefs to hold f.tcred
. I n ihort.rfe", what I allude to, is Hofhine
left then the late very charitable donatior
of the citizens towards the building of an
jo.fnt i Oh"-* 1 '- I a> ' . ry.r tt; â  lean
doubt, but that on their making contribu
tions towards tHTs end, they ailed from thc
jnoft chriltian impulse. But it mud Hill
be acknowledged, that in this, their cha
ritable aÂ£tion, they have <iift 1 aimed the
benign principles which a Benezet and a
Wiibcrforce have laboured to vindicate;
snd whieh, they thenifelves but lately ap
proved.
sty whom was this generous building firft
â¢ropoied ? Was it by a friend to mankind ?
'â VaÂ» it fuggelled by a republican ? Or was
! not firll proposed by men who blehd the
vorlt ariftocratical principles with the
pm eft religious sentiments ? They led the
,uiwary charitable citizens to make liberal
< omiibutions,pleading the specious motive
of alleviating the mileries of the blacks,
and of placing them on a more-equal foot
ing ; but 1 fear, instead of this, it will be
followed by difaflrotis consequences to the
people of the United State 3.
It cannot be denied, that the molt virtu
ous men among us might be entangled b)
the intrigues anel ckieane e>f tiie nioli vici
Â«us. This is fufficiently evinced by the
foregoing instances; and lam ot the opi
nion. that had not the proposition jull
mentioned, been so fliortly followed by it)
encouragement, it would, at this time, be
unthought of". And instead of this utter
partition we should row fee a negrc
presbyterian or a negro episcopalian,
as heartily welcome to a feat in St. Afaph's
or Chrift'a as the whitest among us.
lam so far frdm admitting the lead por
tion of virtue to be in thispo'olic act. that
I firmly believe it to be a tin against the
Chrirtian letigion and the Almighty. Do
the christians among ns believe there are
two roads to heaver, one tor the white, the
other, the black ? would not the fame ele
ments received in the faerament by a black
man prove as effectual to the salvation or
damnation of a white one? and yet our
moiejl and humane gentry, refufe to min
gle their praises with the sincere effufions
ot some wbofe greatefl misfortune is. to
clifFer in colour! imagining, as I suppose.
that their devotions will not ascend with
such sweet favors, if alloyed by the praise;
of a negro.
But. even acknowledging what has iuft
been hinted, to be diflant from the design
of the original propofeil fay, that the
thing itfelf is dangerous to, and incompa
tible with, the equality we vow struggle
to ettablifiv I believe (tho' some may
cuntradiit it) that our constitution recog
nizes the rights of negroes. The slates
and the people abotilh tlavery, and declare
3'i 19 have etjual rights. If this be the
cafe, to cramp them under illegal reftric

attack Â»ii our own liberties They are
clafled among the citizens they hive, a
right to all the prviicc.es of citizens; and
tothe fame prnt.-dian' Uam government.
But alas, Â»tlr peace and happiness was no:
Ui reft long undiflurhed. The solves
have broke down our barriers, & are now
rievouring the flock- The roaring lion,
religions asv ell as civil, tears af'tinder the
ties which formerly united the citi
zens of the United States. An aristocratic
junta formed to butcher our liberty are
allowed to form and execute the moll
wretched schemes. And we. if we are no:

the cause of France, our only ally, our bell

realons.
The treaty of Paris, in 1753, has beer
fulfilled by the United States, with facrei

The fur trade is worth to Britain,two mil

from the operation of the funding system ?
our immense taxes are drawn from our
selves inflead of our import beirjtconfined
to Brkifh manufactures ; and in proportion
as we get indebted to British factors, we
injure our feelings as freemen âwe are fa
tisfied that they never did or will love our
government j the very idea of it make;
them flcfc.
Without a revival of the glorious fpiri:
of 1775, we have every thing ro apprehend
from the indefatigable pains of that craf
ty Premier Win. PITT, the mortal enemy
of France and America. Should the form
er be compelled to fubinit to her enemies,
our independence will be endangered.
From the intcrcourfe which, to the great
misfortune of the United Stf.tes, we Conti

experience many sorrows and aifliÂ£lions* â
to a mind not callous, her conduct with
France mnft appear reprehcrrfibl-e and in
famous. The crimes which are laid to
Frenchmen strife from the efforts of ahti
republlcacs and lovers of monarchy, with
a!l that immense number of dependants
who live on the h:;rd earned labors of the
poor in Europe: who, ground almofl to
j>owder, look up to France and America,
as the last refuge or abode for the opprtf
fed.
Whether France will eftafclilh hdrrcpub

it does nut affect or invalidate the juttict

of their independence, France h*s equal

be easily seen that there are few of the Eu
ropean powers but wish her ruin. Liv

freemen to be cured of those habits whie!

those British Uibjects, at present among

it'they are allowed to remain among "us.
without intermeddling in the affairs of our
country, or attempting to raise prejudices

Their nation is immersed in debt, even
the iutereft of which they are unable to
pay ; their citizens are the moC abjefl
slaves on earth, altho' taught to believe
that they are the only people who enjoy
true liberty. The nation begirs to ilifco

When they will be extricated, God only

Mr. Fueneau,
rpHE inducements which firft led men to
enter intw society were, in my opinion,
as various as the individuals who composed
it were numerous-âln society, after the
eftabliihinent of order and laws, the
timid found protection for their per
sons and property ; the cunning an ample
field forthe exercise oftheir curled schemes;
and the daring and fortunate, favourable
opportunities of raising themselves to dif
tinflion and eminence by eHterprize, and
the credulity and'imidity of their fellow
men. The fame game we find conflailtly
played, even at the present day, in all civi
lized countries upon-earth, when a fit op
portunity offers.
Unalliited merit, it has been remarked,
rarely proves, in any-age or*country,a solid
recommendation to man : whereas atKons,
the mofl infamous and difgraceful to hu
manity, have, not uufrequently, ra-'.fed a
v.le ruffian to a throne. The scoundrel,
â who butchered thousands of his fellow
crertures. has often been honored with ti
tles and privileges, and his progeny, altho'
never so iniquitous and infamous, have
b.-en deemed sacred, and denominated em
perors or kings, to the no small injury and
(iifconragement of the communities to
which.they belonged.
Ithasbeen a with the relieving
part of mankind, to what taule is to be
ascribed tiie unqualified respect ami vc-ne
rat-iou geneMly paid in every community,
and iii all nges, by tile great mats. ot the
people, to men - 1 power, anil sometimes
even without the leait lliadow of" merit. â
Some attribute it to a mixture of ambition
and felf love, whicil leads men to venerate
that pre-eminence, at which they with one
one day or other to arrive.Others again ai
firm, that man is conftaiuly in one ot two
extremes, either a tyrant or a (lave, cut
of" which characters he uniformly exhibit*
as often as circunjltances require, v ithiiut
any regard to mediocrity.âThisdifpofition
of the human mind, whether a natural
principle,or acquired habit, is liiliionoi ablt
to man. It links him beneath his fellows,
and prepares the way for defpotilm.
It is the peculiar blelling of republican
governments, that 110 one need be a slave,
unless lie prefers it to liberty and indepen
dence. Here merit and virtue create the
only-difunctions. The lawo make none.
Thi?ir operation and protection is equally
extended to all.
The mind unawed by artificial distinc
tions, would, we might fnppoi'e, turn away
with abhorrence, particularly in this coun
try, from the tlefpotifin of prejudice and
the influence of b 'rbarous culloms. but
do we find this to be the cafe ? Alas! No.
Men will be liavesl
Jn monarchical governments, where des
pots and tyrants fometimesfind it uect ii'ary
to iiiue proclamations, and other arbitrary
edicts, the better to enforce their authori
ty, and support their measures, we find
their minions and Haves re-echo approba
tion throughout the extent of their domini
ons. This may be neceiWy to support cor
ruption, rut how dif^racefulto the freeftates
of America, to remark on a late opcal;on,
this degrading cultom introduced amonglt
us. Admitting the expediency and.cotijli
tutionality of the late proclamation, has
the firfl magirtr.tte done any more tiian his
duty? Have we any occasion to import the
ruinous culloms of corrupt government;, ?
Have republicans need of court intrigue.,
exotic manners, secrecy or fy.cophmicy ?
Will not {implicit/ of conduct, rectitude,

[From a late Paris publication, authorized
by the Convention.
The French have begun the present mari
time war with many more advantages than
the English. Men, fhips,and money are the
nerves of war.ln refpeit to these let ut com
pare the lituation of England with our own.
In 1791, alter a pirate of seven 5 ears,
the public annual expenditures of Great-
Britain amounted to 17 millions flerling,
whereas her receipts did not exceed ili
millions. Before the revolution a million
of pounds sterling was equal to 25 millions
of our livres, that is to fay, 425 millions
w ere necessary in order to govern a nation
of about seven millions of men, while the
*5 millions of French, in times of peace,
pay nothing near the amount of that exor
bitant tax. An Englishman paysjuft three
times ao much tax as a Frenchman, so that
when the nation enters into a war, she has
nothing left to mortgage for the loans they
are obliged to make to carry on the war,
the ordinary expence for support of go
vernment in times of peace exceeding by
one million sterling their receipts; while
France has ready at all times threethoufand
millions livres worth ot national property,
as a fund for any extraordinary exigency-
And even fhonld this fund be exhatilted,
the richness of the foil and the induitry of
the French farmers oifer immense. un
touched, resources of a kind thathave been
long ago devoured by theprefling necelfitie:
of ail English ministry. There is another
circumstance (trongly marking the present
did re (fed situation of that haughty nation.
The armament,oftenlibly fitted out against
Rullia in 179 c, colt very near four millions
(terling, This Cum makes part of a debt
of 20 millions of pounds flerling, not re
deemed, whilfl the ministry, to conceal the
wretched slate of the nation under colour
of its prosperity, extinguishes yearly a mil
lion of pounds flerling in the English funds.
To fink, a million when the annual deficit
isnearly equal to a million; when near 20
millions poundsftcrling are not yet funded;
when, to face their pressing demands they
are obliged so far to descend as to draw
from the bank of England' five hundred

fFrom a French pamphlet, very lately
pubi/ji'.si at I a. is.]
An HTftorical exposition of th? motive?
thatlcdtoa rapture between the Kreiicii
republic and the king of Great Britain.
WHEN the French nation made a for
mal avowal of tlwif political independents
and civil liberty, ti.ey could nut avoid pay
ing some attention to tliemnnefousnations
in their neighbourhood. It was a inatti r
of confidera'ole moment to find Come, if
poliible, who by a happy congeniality of
opinion might applaud at lead, if they
could not co-operate in the new fociai 1);
tejn that was set en foot. Situated, as it
were, in the midst of a vast number of na
tions fubjeel to the yoke of despotism,
France perceived the neceffiiy us an alli
ance, and a free communication of the re
ciprocal sentiments of a fraternal friend
(hip.
Britain, that idand To fortunate for a
("udecflion of ages, the abode of pMlU'ophy
allxl the arts uleftil to manâaniiland, Lh.it
in the last century difplaycd so (liining sii
example ol its native energy, Cftmed to
hold tip to the infant rc r ub!.c of FranseJ
men and principles worthy of her efteern.
In this view France gave herfclf up, with
a degree of entirrtfiaflic warmth, to the
plthilitlg tllulion, tfcar an ir.dili'ohible union
might take place between twogrtfat nati
on . that had for ages been the prey of
court perfidy and ininilterial ambition.â
At rliis period there were many fymptonn
of a reciprocal efleem and growing friend
(hib between the two nations (had they
been left to themselves)- which if attended
to Would have regenerated the world'and
enfureda permanent rtpene to all F.urope.
There were still in England men of free
and liberal spirits who dared to Ipenk their
fefttiments in their public congratulations
of an. ASSEMBLY, which at thÂ«t time
wis the voice of the French nation â
They even formed focietic* to corcefpâ¢ 'id
with their continental brethren, in order
to smooth the way to fdcial felicity, and
to ensure forever the peace. tranquility,
airrl independence of mankind.
Could any oue have forefcan that this
accommodating fplrit between the two
nations would become the principal source
of a jealousy and hatred which w i t even>-
tualiy catife the (bedding of torrents of
blood in the four parts of the world I In
a rtiere brotherly correspondence between
hisfubjects and the regenerated cirizen-i of
France, George the third perceivect no
thing but plots and" schemes to overturn
liis throne. Either thro'fear, or the in
trigues of an infidiotiy policy, he gained so
far upon his subjects as to prevail upon
thera to (land up in defence of a cunftittf
cion which had never been infringed ex
cept by himfelf and his predeccHbrs. The
liberty of the press, the right of refi'ling
lawless authority, and the peaceable afiem
blingof the people, those sacred privileges
of every English citizen, fell a prey to his
ambition ; and while he abused the con
fidence of his fubjeits, he prevailed upon
them to become the inltruments of their
own deftruftion, and to (nrrender to the
nod of tyranny all that is dear to man.
To prevent the people from perceiving
the strides of his uftfrpation;, it becamt
ne'eefftrv to fix their attention upon the
affairs of foreign l nations. Their mind
w ere to be employed, vnd imaginary dan
gers were to be conjured ~ j in order t<:
conceal real k'ff- s. A war wit!: Frailer,
it was thought, would aufwer a threefold
purpose. 1 ft. It would prevent an interi
â¢jr reform, 2d. the creatures and depen
rfenr-- of die c6iirt vou!d be immenfi-'y irt
creafed ; and, 3dly. it would prevent any
4nfwer being given to the demands of the
nation, originating from Pitt'* pompous
promises, that the enormous debt tinder
which they labour, (liouid be gradually
aboli:!iec*. âAmong that mercenary herd
of men who are ever willing to ftiblift up
on public calamity, the king and hib tome
soon found adherents, in abundance.â
Cohftitiition v as every where the rallying
word to the agents of tyranny, while the
true friends of liberty andofriheir country
hardly dared to vent their froans under
the mrferies that were impending* The
fame petniciouimeafures which for twelve
years together were employed againlt tlie
free Americans, were again to he
to agailill the in aUit'j. The molt abfurA
calumnies, reports the mod improbable,
were induftrioti fly circulated .hi i/i.,igland.
to irritate the m.iidi of the people
the pretemledplots of a French faflion in
the kingdom. The fentimeuts ot the pa
pular p.crty in France, were asserted to be
in union with this faction ; and :o compter
[he ahfurdiiy, a dcreiiftion of the Roman
Catholic rci.gion wa.-.madeacba'-gc aeainft
us, altho' England herfelf bad diileilted
from it, and eiftablifiied the 111 oft solemn
laws of reparation frcm its communion
many years before. The denial of the
pope's fuprencac) was also made a charge
against us in a country where every person
holding the leali employment wider go
vernment mult prtiionfly abjureitin form;
and where all tivofe who are so unfortu
nate as to belies e in the Roma , pontiff, or
Sdbtre to nis creed, are fiercey ftifferetl
to eijoy the meanest rights of citizeiifhip.
With such pitiful arguments, how ever,
the ITugliih mir.rftiy kept tie nation in
play for near a year, and at length gained,
so far upon it as to render a war with
France a popular objefi among a great
part of Che peopleâa war, which belides
the enormous expcnces it will give birtli
to, will deprive England Â«f the <arioi:;

Without attending to the pettmin-v !of

connexion would gi.ve. birth to a (triit
friend Ihip with a nation whom they efleem

Gfjjtlemfn,
FOR your unrenmnerated services, facri

you did me the honor last winter of ap

of the I nited States concerned in compen

fulfilling their mod sacred contracts, that
while unpaid, entail 011 the gfl

with the Hroft poig.i ..it grief for the honor

If you had petitioned for the funis actu
ally due <>ii principles in the
courts of jul'.iee, throughout the United
Stales, you had a right to 17/6 in the pottndj
but, when you offered ti take up with the
facings wh eh government had made out oi
the army debt, and your claim was denied,
and your cafe without remedy, every ho

Representatives of the United States.

The controve; ij which the ambiguous
language of the Prcfidcnt's proclamation
gave rife to, ought certainly to cesfc upon
his own explanation of it. In his anfvvei
to the address from the merchants of Sa
lem, I once more trace the language ol
Gen. Washingtonâ" In making this de
claration (he fays) I was persuaded that I
spoke the willies of my Countrymen, with
out violating any political or moral obli
gation." He does indeed speak their lan
guage, & the only one befitting him as their
head, when he declares it their duty ant!
interest toobferve a neutrality without vi
olating their obligations. In any other
language, one can lee nothing but the mi
lerable duplicity of a pawnbroker; deriv
ing its hopes from an alliance with foreigr
factors, and availing itfeif of the fears of <
fsrdid collection of lix per cents. It is 1101
a grateful circumflance to a teal lover 01
his country to fee its outset marked bj
such an influence, i hope the detection
howsver, of this firft effort to disgrace us
will fatisfy these people that if they intend
ed an experiment, they havemillaken thoft
up'-m whom it was to be tried ; and if the;
! really designed to facrifice the national re
putation to their private lecuritv, or emo
lument. they deserve a punilhmeiit which
until they favour us with a second effort,
j may be left to their own feelings. It i:
obvious that three words in the proclama
tion, would have precluded the neceflity oj
the explanation now given of it, and thai
it mult have been painful to the Prelideni
to find its n Â»:aning called for : He is verj
little obliged therefore to those who force
him forward to make that intelligible,
which, it:s now clear, he never intended
Ihould be left in uncertainty. At all event's
the American public have now gained a
conltruttion, and find their infant republic
speaking, at a second effort, that language
which becomes it, and whichit would have

**â Tomorrow completes Seventeen
years since the Declaration of Independence
in this country. By accounts from differ
ent parts of the United States, the day will
be very generally celebrated, in comme
moration of that extraordinary event,
which gave birth to the infant liberties
of 3 millions (at this day near 4 millions)
of our countrymen, and which seems
finally to involve in its conferences a lit w
political order and condition of thing; a-
mong mankind, infinitely ircfire favourable
than at mjy former period, to the general
happineft of the species; It may be here
proper to remark that the mere obferra
tion of the Day can answer no valuable
purpose, if, amidfl the hilarity ufuaily ma â¢
nifeftrd on the occalion, it does not recall
every intelligent mind to a rational re-ex
amination and conviction of the truth of
those great principles upon which our re
volution was founded, and which if not
duly attended to by every citizen in his
whole line of conduct, might, for U9, as
well have never been called into exigence.
Let republican patriotism revive, then,
and let every individual re-acknowledge
those great and benign principles that ac
tuated his countrymen or himfelf Â©n the
FOURTH OF JULY, 1776, in the glori
ous cause of the rights of human nature,
political equality, and a government lo.un
ded on the authority of the people.

Copy of two Pieces annexed to the letter

reiiding at Philadelphia, dated Chetter

\_See our
ExSraS frr.m the proceedings of the /Jfemlly
of the Commune of Csyes in the iflcmd of
St. Domingo, in the fijfion of the 29th oj
January, 1793.
" A CITIZEN propofcd that the af
fem'biy should guarantee their per
fonalLiberty to all and every the members
of the Commune." This proposition was
rece.ved and decreed by the general voice
ar.d re-iterated (hout of the citizens, who
â¢without diltinftion of colour, swore <0 ob
{civ? it. Another citizen then addrefTed
liimlelf to the assembly, and informed
them. " that several ci izens had been ta
icen frOTi their duellings and confined on
board the frigate Saphira, in the road ;
that others were deptived of the r public
emplov Ticnts without any previous notice,
or a respeCt to the forms prescribed by law,
and that w thout the rega'd due to citi-
Zti ship, the civil commissioner had taken
â upon hind'i f to enact and au'horize the
execution ot certain tyrannical ed:fts, net
c fideii-ng that the firft and great law o!
public fafety (hould have difcouragcd ar.d
prevented such abnfes; but that nevertbe
lefs jufticc, that guardian dci y of an afTo
ci ted people, (and which directs all their
public ads, when they h ve the courage
t regulate them by that standard) ought
to induce the afTembly to a declaration
whether it was the r opinion that the citi
zens, then ast a ally filtering under the sen
tence of the civil commissioners; sre guilty
of treasonable acts againtl their country, in
a (late of rebellion, or in a capacity of mc
letting the public tranquilityâit they
should deem that not to be the cafe, & those
citizens were to be considered as petty
conspirators, who could not escape the vi
gilant eye and protecting care of the civil
commissioners, then in such cafe it should
be their duty to demand an explanation on
the fubjeft, which (V.ould carry conviction
into the minds of the public, and clear up
the motives of cenduft that actuated the
civil commissioner."
This motion was received, supported,
and difcufled by a great number of warm
speakers, and the fnbjeft matter thereof
maturely deliberated
â¢" The alTembly taking into considera
tion, that altho' it may not belong to them
to deliberate on the extent of the powers
and the authority confided to the civil
commissioners, yet it is an inconteftible
truth that they are nottofurpofe that the
(pirit of the several laws which have crea
ted civil commissioners either in the French
departments, or the colonies, for the pre
servation of peace and public tranquility,
or recalling the citizens to those eternal
truths which ought in future to form the
basis of the French social compact, a ftrift
equality among all members of the com
munity without diflir.ftion of colour, and
th" n-reatefl regard for property and indi
vidual libe tyâ we fav, we are not to sup.
pose that the legislature meant to under
mine in the least tnebafis of these truth;
and principles, which are irrevocable ilill
less to infringe that firft and unalienable
right, recognized by the nation at large,
(who have delegated their autho ity) thi
right of watching over the execution of thi
laws.
The afTembly ccnfidering further, thai
jt is no intrusion upon the authorities 01
poweisof the civil commissioner to requefi
an explanation of the use he has made ol
them, especially as it is probable that thro'
an over heate zeal he may have inter
preted th fe powers erroneeu.ly,& have cr
red in carr ing them into execution,with a
feveiity too, that might have given uneasy
fenfatioi s even to a civil commissioner, toe
well fixed in his republican principles to
infringe them inconliderately ; and which
has equally afflicted all our citizens, in
keeping them in constant fear and dread ; a
state insupportable to French republicans :
And considering also another principle,
common to all legislation, that the letter oj
the law lilleth and the spirit maheth alive,
our citizens have reason to believe, that
the powets delegated to the several Cl "
commillioners (how extenfivc soever we
nay suppose them, or however pcfitivc
(heir a. uthority) do not yet go beyond
those generous principles that have eUa
blilhedtlie French Republic, ill left to
violate that fundamental law, the declara
tion of the rights of men and citizens in
a (late of society.
Conlidering, again, that (he natural
consequence to be deduced is, that the
oowers of the civil commillioners, ahd the
inftru&ions they have received, do not
give them a discretionary power to inflicl
upon the citizens such punishments as de
privation of place, arrest, and banishment,
which should be reftri&ed to those only
who have made a deliberate .reftftance tc
the law, and are guilty of trcafon ; and
that even with regard to these their con
viction must be left to the laws and forms
that are the prote&ors and confervatorj
of the precious rights of man, ih a llateoi
societyâconsidering all this, it is plain
that citizens fufpefted of crimes, of trea-
Ton, or of difobedier.ee to the law", ought
to be denounced to their natural judges,
before whom they may clr.;m thejuftice ol
the law, or pay the penalty due to then
criminality.
Conlidering, finally, that Citizen Poi
cer 1, the civil cotnmifltoner, has in th<
tnoft public manner afiented to theCe prin
:ip!es in declaring that citizen Leor
I'erigny should remain judge in the colony
DEC REED therefore, that an address foal
be drawn up and pr-fented, in the nai*c o:
he commune of Cayes, to the national civi
tomm flioner, by the prcfident and fecre
:ariei of this aflembly, which in the firfl
