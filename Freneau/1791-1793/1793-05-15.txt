Aucirejs to the Citizens of the United States
[Concluded from our lad.]
X_tAVING attempted a lhort explanation
" of our duties wirh refpeit to pity, len
<-!l>ililv, and gratitude ; apologized tor the
part which some friends of mankind have
taken in conversation againd the rigid pro
ceedings of the French ; traced the out
lines of a portrait of the violent enemies
of Frenc i principles ; considered it as in
dubitable that the king of the French had
secretly aflided the invaders of his country;
taken a (light view of the three principal
nations engaged in the late war ; ot the
war, and fo'iie of its consequences ; and
given a colouring to the portra t of our
Anti-republican Americans : I lhall now
proceed to notice some general afperlion*
thrown upon the French nation, and the
partieular charges of unparaleiled cruelt)
and arbitrary proceedings against Louis
C pet, and intersperse the remaining part
of this efl <y with such observations as may
elucidate my ideas of the necessity of rigo
rous measures, and serve as a lookiiig
glafs, as well to our bewildered republi
cans, as to the declared defenders of 1110-
narchs.
The French, itisfaid, are devoid of ah
religion, a nation of Atheills! A heavy
charge indeed, and perhaps 100 true wit.:
respect to many of them, but not much, it
any, more applicable to them than 10 their
accusers. Are the cabinets and armies ot
their enemies, are their (la ulerers puritifd
from Atheism ? They are not âthey arc in
aliemblage of Biguts and AtheifU, it is *
mark of a political creed ; and tho' tlie
Hate of religion in France may be very low
at present, there is n< doubt, but th t un
der the liberty of couCcience there permit
ted, the French will reflect upon, and be
convinced of the importance o4 religious
opinions.
The French, fay their enemies, are mad
men, in endeavouring to introduce whai
they call the levelling system, and the idea
of equality, which is not found d in na
ture. It is true, that the diilin&ions
which nature and accident occaliou will
always remain, but let those definitions
be regulated by nature and accident only,
not by law ; yet th.s fyltem ought ratlu r'o
be called an elevating, than a I villi
one, as it raises the bulk of the people, but
deb ifes none.
Again, the tryal ar.d the condemnation
of the late king was neither the real voice
of the nation nor that of the convention,
many members of that body went to the
trial, with a determination to vote for
him, but were forced, through the fear ol
immediate death, to join the mob; the
falfehood ot this aflertion will appear to a
ny candid person, if he reflects but a mo
ment on the liberty of speech exercised by
fevcral with impunity, whillt aflaflination
was the fate of Michael Le Pelletier. In
all revolutions of government and civil
wars, it has been a misfortune common to
the fmallelt and weaked party to believe
that they spoke the will of a great majori
ty of the people : Thus, in 1775, the ad
herents to Britain, were fully perfuadtd
that they spoke the voice of the count, yâ
thus, in La Fayette wrote, that the
French were for monarchy ; and now, in
1793, the partizans of Louis Capet alledge
that clubs and mobs do every thing, againll
law, and the voice of the nation ; but we
believe, that those clubs and mobs are the
nation itfelf.
If we believe the various declaiiners a
Â£ainft the French, the decapitation of their
late king was the moll arbitrary, the mod:
bale, bloody, cruel, horrid, ferocious,
murderous action that is mentioned in the
annals of mankind, or that ever disgraced
any people or country. Tht fuchafferti
ons Ihould be advanced among a gang ot
the molt ignorant beings in the creation,
who had never read a page, nor heard ot
cruelty, would not have been fnrprizingâ
but that such absurdities fliould be printed
is truly ridiculous, for it pre-fuppofes a
capacity to read, which, to every cool re
flecting perlon, mull be a fuffie.ent anti
dote to repel the poison and fury which it
was withed they Ihould indil : Thus, the
enemies to the rights of man, alio flew
themlelves inimical to common sense : But
in one thing, they have shewn a portion of
knowledge, in beingfenfible that the ef
fects of their favourite governments are
not yet so perfectly eradicated, but that
there are 110 affections, however absurd
and contradictory they may be, but what

A firm persuasion of the propriety of thi:

infamous progenitors need not have clofecl

am not certain, but I have always set a

if upon equal terms, fhotild prefer a person
I'd clefcended, to another whose lii)eag<

iilpolition is creeping fouth-weftard ; the
two 1 alt r.umners ot the Delaware Gazette
printed in Wilmington, have fallen i,.(c
my hands , in one of them, a writer, who
[ignsfu.,<felf a Delaware Citizen, has giv
en a compleat apotheolis of Louis Capet ;
in the other, the Subscriber, as he ligns
himfelf, almost as compieatly enrolls the
Citizen's ideas among the divine illumina
tions*: 1 do not kno a what ge tlemen are
the writers of those two pieces, but hope,
for the honor o the Delaware ltate, that
they are both written by the fame hand.
I mail not, like the Subscriber, pledge
myfelf tâ prove the perfect innocence and
limb l.k di polition of either party in
France; on the contrary, I believe that
excelles have oeen committed as well 0,.
the part of the people, as on that of their
kings, or at lealt w hat might be called so
in the common ot.urrences of life ; but
in the preient liate ol society you have n,
right to expect any tiling Ids, and more
elpetially in a country, where you fa,
there is no sense of religion, of moral du
ties, nor of civil r ghis. Admitti g this
accufationo: 'general depravity to be true,
it is a very ,iro ig argument to pro\e the
infulhtienty and villainy oi the former go

ot a man is not formed in a day, and much
time is required to divelt him ol evil, fe

the ancient laws, man ers ana religion,
then, i; a people who might have been fa
iliioned, or \sho were lallnoued by tht
hand, and to the w ilh of the government

rienas in the universe, it is a poor comment
on that government and that religion in

which, among warriors, must neceliarilj
be accompanied with " confufed noises,
and garments rolled in blood."
But to , eturn to the Delaware Citizen ;

adoption of his quotation ; â" Cum ingraÂ«

m>fell oi his tranfl. l tion, but cannot help
applying them very differently : He charg
es with ingratitude, such Americans as do
not cxprcls a lively concern at the loss of
Louis XVI, and join in execratirg the
French Nation for putting him to death,
ami purely upon this account, that when
he was king of Franco, he ordered his
troops to fight for America against his old,
>nveter3ie euemies* He, the Citizen, is
extravagant in his prailes of our Congrtfa
in '7/8, in order to bring forward a quo
cation from their minutes, to prove t!: ;t is
was not interelfesl motives alone that in
duced him to do so. Ihe N..ticn.il Con
vention of France being a lime removed
from the time of action, and yet not so far,
but thai many of them were personally ac
quainted with the king and the mimlters of 1
the day, are surely more capable of judg
ing ot the motives of action, than the Con-Â»
grefs of the United States ; but h -d the
Congress known the true caufts of the af
filtance given u by the French king, y,Hit
would have been extren eiy impolitic at
that critical moment to have nientk id
them: That the heart of Louis X\ I was
penetrated with a sense of the ti .hts of
man, a? we held them in the ye | 1778,
there is no good reason to believe j-but on
the contra!}, that his motives were chiefly,
if not wholly the offspring of felf love of
hatred to Cleat-Britain; refpefting this
matter, is the inconliftency alluded to a
vvlule ago. Some of the fame men, who
now talk as the Citizen, of the gratitude
due to Louis, did, in the yrar 1778 and
'?79''P e akin a very different manner j
tluy (aid that the buik ot the individuals of
the French nation are enthufiaftit in favor
of w hat you call liberty, yet the court of

lometimes falfe, and sometimes a mixture,
not altogether true nor altogether falfe,
so were the assertions of those Del: ware
C tizem. Now you, the citizens of Ame.

If, in contemplating the king, you for

The reader will recollect try ideas and
definition of j>ity,Jevfil/ility and gratitude,
in the firJi part of this di/i urje.Intion ; many other arbitrary proceedings,
even to (I ach, might be produced in this
country during the revolution, both on the
part oi' t ie Britilh and A uerica.is ; yet you
would ftin palm on the popu.ace, and one
another, an opinion, that the execution of
Louis Cap t was t.ie only arbitrary pro
ceeding ever hear 1 of. Americans, exe
crators of the French Republicâwere you
for the American R volution or not?âli
you were, con.emptibie are your iilferii

punished with severity, even where tilt
culpability was doubtful; you nave threat

rage a id li ltred of a iirui. igham mob, and
burnt i i effigy a man oecaufe he deserted

the Fren. h for executing a nr n whom they
conceived to be fairly accused of treaion
agai ilt the ll.ite.
Of all the cases reco ded in history, per
haps there is none so ex.i Hy limila. to ill it
of Louis XVI. as one which has happened
in our own time a id country; similar in
almost ev.'i'v thing except that Louis was
ltop'd at V irennes, a.rtl is dead, but his
prototy. escaped to the enemy and is pro
bably lti.i living. Borh did in real.ty, con
tribute to the progress of iiberty ; both had
honors a id office conferred upon them by
their country ; bo:h made pretences of tin -
cerity in clie ciufe of freedom, whilst tlie'y
secretly held conferences with and favour
ed the e.iemy , both attempted b> flight to
cfcape to the invaders of their con. tr_v ;
a id both pleaded inviolability on account
of their offi e. By the remar . ble liniili
amy of this lad circumftaiice, you will per
ceive, that this apoltate from freedom,
this traitor to his country, this p, ototvpe
of Louis Capet, iÂ» B. ncdict Arnold. i tr
h.ip . time has cha tged your sentiments With
relpe:t to the henioufnefs of his behaviour,
bu you ought to measure the proceedings

â¢which p. evailed in this country at that pe
riod. Remaps some of you were then in
arms against this country, and appro ed of
his co ljluclâit to, speak out ; it' not, be
comi 'rent ; jtiftice is inflex ble. mercy is
impartial, truth is eternal, and right piin
ciples change not either with time or cir
cumttances. If you execrate the judges of
Lonis, you mud juitify Benedictâll you
abhor the conduit of Arnold, you mud ex
cuse tiie execuiion of Capet.
Fellow Citizens, can you yet be blind to
your own severities, and eagle eye'd to
those of your friends ? Are you acqu linted
with the history of the American revo.u
tion? Did you ever learn the history of
Andre.' Were yin ever informed of the
story of Afgil ? Was Lonis more amiab e
th i i A ldre, whom a 1 his enemies admired?
Was Louis more i nnoce.it than Afgil. >\ ho
was not even accused of a crime ? and yet
th- ft. ere t i nee of a court martial was
th->light uecellary, and executed in the cafe
of Ancjre, and the rigid spirit of retaliation
eve â  upon the innocent, was deliberately
pursued i i the cafe of Afgilâyes, it was
deliberately pursued by the man who i 3 now
the President of the United States, and it
would no doubt have been put in exeiti
tion had it not been for the humane inter
position of some of the very p uple whom
you no ,v blacken with vill linou , names for
exerciling judgment upon a real culprit â
To conclude,! am ot for fhedd ng of blood,
but on the contrary, my object it-the de
fence of tile viftiin. of arilto ratic fury,
and to recad to the memory of Americans
their own actions in time past. It is true
indeed, that I have always favoured the
purity of republican or democratic senti
ments ; and do believe that if the French
republic :hould continue to exist, it wiil
be i idebted so fnecefi to Heaven, and to
men of the mod rigid principles only.â
Grip all. lose all, is a caut : o lary proverb
much to be recommended in many pu, suit
in c>mno i life; but is by no means fuita
lile to fleet .Â» great revolution. Do no
thing hy h lives, ihould be the motto of
every .nan who engages in a work of such
a nature and in tgnitude ; to win the horse
or lose thafaddle, a common faying of the
fame fmport, seems to be the resolution of
the French nation ; a resolution juftifiable,
not only as it affects poflerity, but alio by
the powerful, the all-fobduing motive of
felf-prefervation. Had the king been left
ti ion- the throne, I have no doubt but that
iu a (hort time we should have seen without
aly violent concussion, a long and rigid
proscription of all the inoft active friends
of lib rty. Without such men as those
who conder- 1 Andre, we should now be
a province the Bririlh empire ; without
such men i those who condemned Capet,
France would have been as Poland.
I am not of a sanguinary disposition, but
of the contrary. None but kings, or persons
of great influence, Should be judged to
death for any crime whatever. It seems
to me that the infliction of death should not
be an indication of the enormity of a crime
âneither mould the molt henious crimes
be pnnilhed in that way ; becaufj a better
mode of pumihing the offender, of pre
ve iting by example, the line offence in an
other; of making restitution to the inju
red ; and of securing the peace of focietv,
is generally w'thin the power of the com
munity.
In fine, to deprive any martal of that life
which God alone has given, is certainly an
act which very few transgressions can jufii
ty ; perhaps i,i the eyes of the truly religi
ous and philosophic there are none, but if
there be, doubtiefs tliey are only Inch as no
other human contrivance c;m punilli or in
future prevent; or such, against which no
thing but the death of a certain object can
ere it a b.irrier fufficient to le'cure the peace
of the (late. Such are the invalion of our
ciearefl tre'afures by an armed forte j fuc.ii
are the eliorts of a.l oppofs-r of his coun
try, when aided by so many powerful abet
tors that he cannot be otherwise securedââ

TO THE PUBLIC.
|T HAVE lately received a letter from :
I person of extensive information at Paris
imparting much good advice, in reflect t<
the conduct the American governmeni
fllould observe at this crilis ; a governmeni
to which 1 f eel myfelf highly attached, ;>nt
wifli all poflible profperiiy and fiiccefs. â1
extract a few of the leading ideas, anc
every impartial man to judge what
effect they ought to have ujton us at thi:
time.
The Americans cannot be too circnm
fjie-t in their reception of Citizen Genet,
minister from tlie republic of France ; a
republic that has not yet been acknowledg
ed a fnch bv the great maritime powers o
Europe ; the 1 annexions now forminc
with France, might be attended with the
molt fatal corifequences to this country
particularly if we should give umbrage t<
thole powers by 100 oitentatious marks 01
preference shewn to M. Genet The alli
ance of Americ a with France, would b;
no means excule such partiality, or coun
tenance an attention tnal was not paid tc
Irrs predecefior, or other ministers.
It is very poflible that t'<e government oj
France is already changed since the depar
ture of citizen Genet, and even that the

" 1 he fpirii oi the people (fays Hume]
inuft irequently be rot-fed, in order to curl
the ambition oi the court : and the dreaci
at rouling this spirit, 1 nil it be employed t
prevent that ambition. Nothing, is' so ef
e&ual to this purpose as the liberty of the
press, by e.hichall tlie learning, wit. anc
genius of the nation may be employed on
thfc fide of freedom, and every one be ani
mated to it* defence. As long, therefore,
is the republican part of our government
:an maintain itfelf igiinft the monarchical,
t will naturally be careful to keep the
press open, as of importance to its own
preservation."
Upwards of 600 persons aflembled on
Saturday hit at the Crown and Anchor
raveru, to support tiie liberty of the press.
Previous to the dinner,
Richard Brinfley Sheridan, Esq. the
chairman, read an addrefsfrom the friend*
:>f the people 111 Southwark, in which that
ocieiy highly applauded the principles anc!
practice of the friends to the liberty of
the press, conjuring them to proceed wit!
lirmnefs and with temperance, until their
great object should be accomplished.
With regard to entering into a fubferip
tion for supporting the â¢ ppi efled, Mr. She
ridan said, it was not intended that the
fubferiptior. should take place, on this day,
but immediately afterwards.
Mr. Courtney, M. P. trnfted, that the
focjety would support rhofe whom govern
ment had oppressed, on account of their
having dared to exen ife the freedom of opi
nion : he mentioned the following circuni
(tance, to prove the extreme ignorance of
b Jlad fingers as well as bill flickers : "P:if
ling thro' a street. he heard a ballad fing
er abusing Mr. Thomas Paine in a long.
He told iiim he was acting in atreafonable
manner." The man replied, " that he
thought he had a right to abuse Mr
Paine." 'â¢ Not at all," rejoined Mr Court
ney, '-government has declared, that hi
name shall not be mentioned, and if you
tig that song again, I will fe ;d for a con
{table; ami take you up." f lie man pvo
mifecl never tomention-tlie na:,.e ot Paine
again.
Mr. Grey (P. 51.) informed the meeting,
that he had received a petition from Mr
Thomp on, a'bookfeller at Birmingham,
who. before the fecoiid part of tiie Rights of
Jvlan was declared a libel, was taken up
for felling it, and directed to give bad for
.'oool. his friends ottered unexceptionable
ba 1 for 1500!. Being 11.able to procure
t'nis bail,'he was sent to the felon's iide of
Warwick jail, \\ here he iio.v remains.â
(A general shout of indignation pervaded
the wlioie meeting.)
After dinner, Mr. Sheridan gave as a
toast, " the liberry of the press,'' which
was received with loud plaudits, and ac
c<.mpanied with three times three. He
then proposed the health of Mr. Erfkine,
which was also drank with three times
three.
Mr. Erfkine immediately nddrefTed the
'.flembly. tie congratulated them 011 the
arninef* and temperance of their conduit,
and exprefled hisfr.risfaction at feeing such
a number of persons, so refpeÂ£table for
their talents and their characters. He de
clared that he did not expect that half the
numner would liave been present, for he
knew that artifices and menaces had been
used to keep persons away. The minister
was d with the present meeting.
He reprob '.ted it, and therefore they might
reft allured, that they herein the right."
Mr. Sheridan then gave the health of
Mr. Fox, the author of the libel bill.
It was drank with much applause, and
three times three. He then pro: ofed that
the friends of the liberty ot the press fhoulci
meet'ngain on the 20th o: April, and that
Mr. Grey Ihoukt be requeued to take the
chair. Ihe proposal was received with
loud plaudits.
Mr. Grey returned thanks to the com
pany for the Junior they had conerred on
him. He adored them, that he li.ould stu
dy to deserve their favor, and to merit
their approbation Having mentioned the
cafeotMr. fhompfon before dinner, he
proceeded to state another cafe, which he
liad begun to mention when the companj
were summoned to dinner . It was that lii
Thomas Handifide, a day laborer, who.
because in a public house he merely f ok
out of his pocket Mr. Paine'sktter to Mr.
Dundas, was immediately carried before a
jliltlce of peace, and ordered to give bail
tor 200 c] Being, as was expetted* unable
to give fucii bail, he was actually hand
cuffed like a common criminal, carried tc
1 loathsome jail, and chained by the leg as
:lioughhe had been a murderer : his hands
were swelled and rendered useless by the
areHure of the irons, r figics, he said,
lad been prepared at Dunley in Worcef

Tl.ey were filled .with blood and Iheep' 1 !

Here a sudden burst of indignation a!

Vom tiie society, which interrupted Mr,

Copy of a letter from Gen. Dumourier
dated < t Tirleniout, March 19. to the
Minister of war.
â¢' It is with great pain, citizen minister
hat 1 communicate to you an account 01
:he check which I have received. or
1111 ft have seen, bymy letters of yeflcrday.
hat my presentiments are but too truly jul
ified, 011 account of the news which I have
â¢eceived <vf the dangers at Namur, in the
ipproach of a corps of about 10,000 men.
,\ho direÂ£ted thetnfelves towards BruHellf
ind Louvain. I had doubts that it would
lot have been in my power to preserve tin
niblic good, without dislodging the enemy
.0111 the camp of IServengen. I have
made, in consequence, an attack on the left
vving of the enemy; my centre ri'vifion
made their attack on Nei vengen, and my
left, commanded by Miranda and Lhamp
morin, attacked 011 the viilageâThe right,
and the centre of the armv had feme fuc
i ess, although the infantry was twice re
pulsed, and driven from the village of Ner
vengen. The left wing proving unfortu
nate, their retreat was made with confu
iion till behind Tirlemont, or perhvps a
little further. The Marefial de Cant
Mielen was killed, who commanded the
artillery, and two general officers \ver<
wounded in this flight, and fundi y pieces of
cannon taken, amongst which there were
three 12 pounders.
I was ignorant of this derargeinent, and
I had prepared an attack for to-morrow to
complete victory. And uneasy at not hear
ing from Miranda, and hearing murmur?
that he had retired, I quitted the victori
ous part ot the field in the evening, to learn
the fitiuuiojj of the left w ing, and was as
tonilhed net to find -P'o nf Hi? corps on my
way to Tiilemout. Jg: lers to Mi

St. Margarita, to Cov the retreat.
I lend you, citizen -;ter, a letter f.-om
Vidlence, who was wounded; and who is
now Oil his way ,<> BrulH-lls. I amgoin e
hick to the camp oi' Louvain to cover
Brulk'lls and M.dines. I cannot diffimn
late that tbee\:l of dilbrganization is at its
height. I fear lor the event of this re
treat, in a country, where we have a^ ra .
vaced the inhabitants, by pillage and the in
discipline of the troops. 1 will do all 1 can
to lave the army, who place in me the tu

judgments.' I will submit myfelf to the
molt severe examination, and I will de
mand a court martial to judge of my con

life can be ot ut.lity to the glorious cause
of liberty ! and I ihall fight till i die, or am
condemned by the patriot:. I fear not the
judgment of my fellow-citizens, or the re
proach of posterity. You ,11 fee that our

PHILADELPHIA.
Wednesday, May ij.
Oi Saturday lass arrived Tit New York
aveffel in 35 days from Hofjand. which
brings Amflerdam accounts to the 4th of
April. According to these the French had
completely evacuated Brabant, and retired
into b ranee, where great disturbances had
tLiken place from infurrettions in different
parts. Ihe Leyden Courant mentions,
that the French in their feverai engage
ments. from the 15th to the 22d, oi March
had loft from 30 to 43,000 menâLouvain
was left by them on the 23d, and on the
24th BruUels, where the Auftrians entered
on the 25thâ On the 26th Antwerp was gi
ven upby capitulation. It was also report
ed that the French h d abandoned Bruges,
and that the Auftrians had taken pofleflion
of Mons, w here they had thfir head quar
ter: âBreda and Gertrnyde? berg were
blocked up by the Aullrian:;, but had not
capitulated.
011 Sunday last arrived here the ship
Morning Star, captain Ken. from Havre
de Grace, w huh li e left the 27th of March.
By t .is vessel we le3rn, that the accounts
heretofore received, of a counter-revolu
tion at Paris, and of the capture of Amster
dam bv the French, are premature âA
body of French forces, however, flill re
mained in Holland, and reinforcements to
the amount of-o.oco men had marched to
the French armies. The people of France
were very unanimous and deteimined,
notwithstanding the check which General
Dumourier lately experienced ; and there
appeared no doubt of their beii.g able to
' efeat the intentions of iheir enemies.â
On the fame day came into this port, the
(hip William, of Glasgow, captured bj the
privateer Citizen' Genet, Â«fl Gape Charles,
about twelve days ago. She was I ound to
the Potowmac, and is the firff veflel cap
turid by the above, which privateer is out
of Charleston with a French con m ffion.
The bed account yet 1 eceived, oi tht fitu
aiion of the French and con billed armies,
is contained in General Drmourier's let
ter. Miranda, who commanded the left,
bl nit d for the whole ot the late check
which has been experienced by the army
of the republic, and he is fufpeuded. Va- ,
ience has been wounded, and Cuftine's ar
my are goirg 011 with great success in the
country near Mayence. So iar from this
theck dilpiritirg the republic, an army of
leventy thotifand men were marching from
Paris to re-inforce C en. Dun mirier. The
queen and princess Elizabeth, together with
the youngprince, were (till fafe in tiie tem
ple, and treated with great civility. No
mention whatever w as made ot a: v inten
tion ii; the national councils, to bring the
tjueento atrial. With refpeft to internal
[liCcontents, they are not nearly of so dan
gerous a nature as has been leprelented,
for evr. the a iflocrats fpole dcti rniined
y against Inbniitting to any kind of a coun
ter-revolution.
W T e hear that Mr. Hammond, the Bri
tish minister, has preferred a memorial to
our execui've. relative to the capture of
the 1 nglifh fliip C range.
Fresh disturbances"are broke out in the
.(land of Martiuico between the patriotic
and arillocratic parties ; the latter ot which
had net wholly, it fetms, (hipped them
selves off to Trinidada, as reported. Se
veral deaths have taken place in confe
quciice of these < flievrors ; am' it was
strongly fufpefted th.e aristocrats ha<l fo
'icited the protection of the Engli lb, whom
they mean, if possible, to put in pollellion
of the island.
We ate afiiired tliEt the ple

zens of the I'nitcd ot: -e-.A ;rAt variety of accounts irom France,
meritio.i the detection of a plot of a coun
ter revolution in different parts of that
kingdomâthe heads of this conspiracy are
the brothers of Louis Capet, the oid nobili
tv, the refractory prlelts, some merchants
of overgrown wealth, and a part of the
: nglilh' parliament, particularly Pitt,
Burke, and Grenville, in concert with the
duke ofÃrunfwick. The principal means
to effect this counter revolution, was the
emiflion of falfe afliguats. Conliderable
numbersof the conspirators have been ta
ken up. and if Meifieurs Pitt, Burke, and
Grenvilie are not among the number, more
is the pity " Those who have disdained
the sovereignty of the French nation will
soon fall on their knees before the sove
reignty ot mankind all ovei the earth.
In May last, Tinpoo Saib renewed his
wars with the English fortes in the i.all
Indies. A particular disastrous event to
the latter, in which many hundreds of
them were drowned and destroyed by Tip
poo's having secretly turned the courfc of
a river ; and his having m.ulean attack at
the l ime time, lrid compelled the Fnglilh
to ask a truce for lix months, which was
granted on their paying thirty millionsâ
in two months after Tippoo broke this
treaty and at the head of 500,000 men was
preparing to attack Madrafs. t Aii Rritifh
commercial houses in Bengal had tailed,
and trade totally at a stand.
The empress of Rnflia has ilfued amani

their hands in royal blood, &c. the far
mer treaty made with Louis the 16th is
annulled, till the restoration of monarchyâ
no Fre-ich ll.ip* under the republican flag
are to be received into Ruffian ports, and
no Ruffian (hips are to enter the ports of
Franceânil French conluls. merchants,
teachers, &c See. to leave Russia in three
weeksâall Ruffian consuls, &c. to leave
France immediately. Xo liberty ot remain
ing in Rnffia is granted the French, except
those who (hail take a moildegrading oath,
promising eternal fidelity to the old mo
narchy of France, an acknowledgment
that the country is now in a state of rebel
lion : p. promise to hold no connection with
the revolutionists, &c. &c. &c.
It is observable in reading the English
debates on peace or war with Â£ ranee, that
one jrrcat objection to negotiation, was t le
supposed at'iei/m of the' French nationâ
Â«â  if this argument had any force in ii (fay
one of their writers) why does the Englii!
government fend an emoaffy to China;
the governors of which countt-y, according
to Mr. Hume, are the only regular bod>
of Atheiftsin the world being the defci
ples of Confucius, and having no priests or
religious eft iblilhments whatever ! and ye
China is an orderly, moral, and what i
ft ill more remarkable, a pacific empire.â
Perhaps French irreligion is the more i -
lifted upon at this time, as the claims ot
kings in the prefenftdifpute are now again
pretended to be derived, not of compa:t &
from human right, but from right-divine ;
which right, it is clear, would fail before
an infidel tribunal. Another objection
made to treating with the French, is their
couelty ; but this appears to be noobftrnc
tion to treating with the Algerines ; who
altho' the cruellest and molt sanguinary
miscreants in the universe, are yet at all
tinees the gv,od fiiends and allies of the
Englifli."

" A copy of verses, entitled The Captive
King, has been published and avowed a

When once the old lion is down, every
Jack-ass mult have a kick at him !âAfter
Pom Paine had been butchered ill every
petty village in the kingdom, it would
have been a miracle indeed had he saved
his bacon at Birmingham. The loyal mob
of levellers there (since the late riots it
would be injustice to deny them the title),
lately dressed up a very ufeful piece of fur
niture, which may be seen in every bar
ber's liiop, and having plated the Rights of
Man in one hand, and a pair of itays, em
blematical wc suppose of " The Rights of
Women," in the other, they named it
Thomas Paine, and carried it in triumph
through the principal llreets, attended by
an innumerable concourse of men, women
and children. The pious rabble, no lef
zealous in the cause of church than king,
made an excellent (liift upon the occasion,
to pitch up a very decent p iir of parsons
of a pair of chimney sweepers, whom in a
moment they converted into right reve
rend Doctors, by clapping upon each qf
their polls only an enormous orthodox
wig, wlierein, tney conceived, all the di

so enveloped tiiele worthy gentlemen, al

Certain accounts are now received oi
the aii. ir of March 18, between theFrencf
ami Aultrians. On that day Dumouriei
was every where victorious, and the enemv
left him pofTelled of the field. His righl
wing was commanded by Gen. Valence,
his centre by Egalite. and his left by Mi
randa and Chanipmorinâthe two formei
were fticcefslul, but the latter, in part, de
fei ted their pelts, loling near 2000 men ;
and out of 500, twenty or thirty pieces ol
cannon. The infantry of gen. Valence
was twice repulsed ; he then led on the ca
valry and broke thro* the enemy, receiving
three wounds from a f.ibreonhU head, ai c
a violent blow on his right arm ; one oi
the I'abre wounds laid the'fkin of his fore
head over his eyes; but none of his wounds
were reckoned mortal. Dumourier had
taken a (1 long polition near Lonvain, 15
miles N. K. ot Bruffl'ls, waiting for a re
i .lorcement of 72,000 men, expected dailj
from Paris, to prolecute the war in Bel
gium and Hollaud. Gen. CulVnie hat:
gained great advantages over the Prussians,
1 <1 repulsed them in every quarter where
they hatl attacked him. The Frenth ap

in the battle of March 18th; the enem)

be new recruits, in a great degree stranger:

in the trade of blood and military ferocity.

ot Oftend and Bruflels, and the capitnla

though bound by no expref- contrast, yet
there is an implied obligation to afiiU the

the opprejl'or, on the fante principle as ill
the cafe ot an individual in a state of na
ture, who fees another attempt an unjust
force upon a third, and ought to interfere
to preserve right. The cause of France is
the cause of man, and neutrality is deferr

It is " not our intcrejlbecaiife despo

of France which will assuredly triumph,

contempt, those animals among us, vr/ui
dare i(h if to disregard our facted o'oli
nations to Fra câ¢, a d via ate our treaty,
as enemies to the hutiun lace, fit tools sot

O,fi ler their conduct, with refpeft ti
the French revolution, and you will fin.l
them only re-acling their p-Â»i ts in the glo
rious American revo ution ;an , that t 1 <

obedience, and non refill rice and hol<

pire : but we ought not to expe&. Jigs
thorr.s, ox grapes ol th\jl>es.
To hear them v I fy the French, wit*

not making them ventroliquilts, to throw
those wor'ls across the Atlantic ocean, a 1 >i
flay the gallant sons of France, you would
conclude they wer "refuge- p r inces of

Capet, you would swear that he was a di
vinity, the National Convention a band of
villains, sent by Pontius Pilate to murder
him, and that they were sent bv Hraven
to avenge the facriligeous aCtâBut, when
I tell you they wer enemies to the gre it
American rev lution ( hat event which
fills the 11 obi> ft page of history, and will

Ivorjhp he golden calf, beca fe he wears a

the arm of power from the head of hts
own r lauon, the descendant of the mur
dered Charles-âTo be idolaters of a jalje
God, who shines in Jlolen plumage, mult b(
idolatry indeed.
Can any n n juftify the principles of
tV>e merican revolution an I condemn
the revolution of France ? Have not the
p ople of France the lame natu-al right ; s
A r.ericans ? re not all mankind i>y na
tu'e â  qual ? Have we not expr fsl de
c ared in our Bill of Rights, " That all
government is de ived from the people, is
founded. :n compact only ?' and, ' * V hat wc
have the sole right of regulating our internal
government " Is it not exprtfsly declared
to be comrary to th laws of nati n3, " Far
one n tion to interfere with the internal go
vernment Â«â¢'another ?" Yes, and they have
the exclujive ight, to deci e on their own
r lutions, 'and form goveinments for
i'jtmfelves :âBut. the trial and execution
of Louis is 7, political crime never to be
forgiven, nor expiate ', but by the boo!
of the Convention of France, as murderers
and ajfftns. Let us c or.fider th'S charge,
and who they are that ..rofecute the Con
vention for itâThey are that herd of little
heroes who (tuck to George the 11 Id in
the American contejl for libei ty; who forget
the murdered Charles ; who, but the other
day, we rejoi ing at the fate ol Louis
becaufe he aided America in her glorious
struggle for liberty, to whom they have
onlv attached thtinlelves, since the usurper
o' Britain has taken a part in i er cause,
her natural enemy, because he wat a ting,
and because theflames of liberty, unless fpe -
dily extinj;uifhed, would certainly melt
every crown in Europe
It dare not be contended, that Louis
was not guilty of the crimes for which he
fnffered death, after the conviction by the
national convention, who alone had that right;
crimes, by the of Moses, expiable by
dea h alone, " He who sheds man's blood
by man Â«' shall iis blood be shed But
Louis was a king and the sacred chara&e
( f kings, the divinity of his title, ought to
have secured him from the pollution of hu
man punifliment ; kings have a divine right
to Jacrijice human -victims on the altars of
roya.ty :â¢ âBut, oh ye sacrilegious Franks,
y u mud be scourged for this iniquity. â
How would the shepherds conduct them
selves towards a crowned wolf, who had
an unlimited jure divino, right, to kili
their sheep with impunity ? Would they
not risk tie provoca'i nof divine â vengeance,
and sac ifice him on the altar of Signine
Liberty ? Would not reason and humani
y p laud the ast ? and, would not na
ture, and nature's God, declare the jultice
of that judgment, and every lamb cry oui
/fm n ? And shall man be condemned for
consulting his own fafety; by th deduc
tion of the tyrants of the earth, those de
stroyers of the human race, and the (hep
her s be applauded for the protection of
th if flocks.
Whst, let me affc, would have been the
fate of George, in the fill of 1776, by
wh -ft' command a num er of his innocent
â¢â I jeets had been murdered by the fwortl,
an by 'he more 1 v go confinement in
pr son (hips, an unnt-c-fTiry rigor of war,
inadmiflable by the usage of civilised nat -
ons : Would they have tried him by a Con
srcfs, and executed iin with a Guillotine:
No,tliey would have given him martial law
they would have confi lered him a tyrant,
a usurper anl afpv tried him by a court
martial, and hung him on a gibbet ; he was
a tyrant or we were rebels ; and shall we
bear the Franks to be condemned, Fot
putting I,'iuis Capet to death by a civi.
trial and a Guillotine, when we v ould have
tried George Whelps by a court martia
and hung him on a gibbet ?
But, if therfc is any thing so sacred ir
the character 'f kings, that they are
above the law, and ma commit, by t eii
fia , murders wit 1 impunity, it is a crimi
to be a king, for which they ought to fut
rcr death : And I do not find in all the
laws of Moses, that kings who commit eti
murders are excepted and by the law o!
nations, a. d of God, tyrants and murdercn
may be put to death.
Let us .letermine to ast an honed part,
preserve our tnaties, and be obedient tc
the rulers of cm land, as long as they con
full the public good ast agreeably
to our conftitijtion : but when they vio
ate tlte one, or the other, let us, Ameri
cans, who deposed k ; ngs, who dared be
free, use the knife freely, that terror tc
tyrants.

to lug in Ctivin's politi s. As a divine
he was in some points as orthodox and ra
her more explicit than an English bishop.
H> scorned to interpose a prevarication
between the foul of Serve/us and the mer

way of saving him from being burnt to all
eternity in the next world, was to burn
him in this â and he burnt him according
