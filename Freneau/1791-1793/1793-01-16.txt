For the Nation al Gazette.
Mr- Frsheau,
UNDER- the influence of t!idea,
that the conditA oftheregular clar
gy in the western parts of Pennfylviims,
feare not investigation ; nor regards tho.e
ungenerous reflexions,, whiCii ma voiei .
ignorance may dictate, I have read wi.n
pity and contempt a piece m your paper
of the 28th of November, wherein the
writer, in order to demonstrate his_ extra
ordinary heroism.in furraounting t,.c dan-
K er to which he was exposed, m a late
tour to Pittfburg, represents the magil
t ->tes, clergy, and civil officers 111 i-Â«
western country, as openly, and danger
ously confederated in a state of aAual in
surgency against the government m the
union. , .
It i, evident that gentleman is ne.the.
acquainted with the western clergy, nor
with the excrcife of those manly virtue.,
which they inculcate, or his treatment ol
his fellow citizens, would have been more
confident with truth, juft.ee and genero 1-
tv . The weltern clergy are too deeply
engaged in discharging the duties of their
function, to condescend to take much no
tice of the excise, or its noisy collectors ;
nor have they ever ben found to combine,
or promote any combination, against tnc
government of the union ; but have al
ways been as forward in their station to
support the laws, discountenance riotous
proceedings, and defend their country, as
any other class of citizens.
Therefore, as a citizen of the United
States, ocecftbr
I c'll upon that gentleman (Mr. ClymerJ
to support his allegations by matte.. ol
fa&, and mud inform him, that unti.
that is done, the western clergy are ca
pableof despising the man that can, with
out any provocation, basely aflaffinatc tlu
character of an innocent class of citizens.
Indeed I frankly confefs,that the great
eft part, if not all of the western clergy :
think it their honor that they are not k
far destitute of that manly fetifibility whict
caufesmenin every station to participat<
the distresses of the induftnous poor, as tc
rejoice at the imposition of an exciie :
which in its operation must be cruelly op
preffive to the inhabitants of the weflerr
country, already bleeding by the irier.
cilefs hands of unrelenting savages.
At the fame time the sentiments ol
the clergy have been, and are, that reason.
petition and remonstrance are the only
weapons which ought to be uled in com
bating tHe-e*cifc4aw j and if those provt
ineffectual, then fubmifiion ought to have
the preference of any other alternative.
I have not seen any of the clergy since
I read the publication referred to; bui
being acquainted with all the regular cler
gymen in the western part of Pennsylva
nia, I presume what I have written will
generally embrace their sentiments. As
to the honourable President of the western
diftrift, the magistrates and civil officers,
I am persuaded their conduA as citizens
will be found, upon investigation, to tri
umph over mifrepiefentation and calum
ny.

IF the present rulers of France were
to lay aside all animosities against pool
Louis and his unhappy family, and place
them in such an asylum as might secure
undisturbed comfort for the remainder of
their days, the bitterest enemies of the
revolution would be disposed to look on
that extraordinary event with abatement
of hostility, if not with positive approba
tion.

The National convention of France
beran its career by abolishing Royalty.â
Without inquiring into the fuperiofity of
the republican system, trie circum(lance3
of their fituaiion jullified them in adopt

pletely loft (he confidence of the nation,
thatsny attempt to retlore him to his for

rous to hiinfelf. The conrtituent ali'em

ons which are the furelt support of monar
chical government,divert the throne ol" that
splendour which is necefl'ary to give it im
portance in the public eye, aud prepared
the way for its final fubverlion. In their
zeal against aristocracy they destroyed the
pillars of the fabric they were labouring tc
rear, and forgot that the sceptre mil (I
quickly drop from the hands of a king wht
has no hereditary nobility, dignified clergy,
and regal judicatures, to command attach

and obedience to his will. The fubftanct

been elfefted than what the common course
of events would have soon produced.
Mentz, which is now appended to the
French conquests, adds no finall degree o!
glory to their arms. It is very anci
ent but badly built. The place was de
fended by about fix thousand men, with ;
very numerous artillery mounted upon the
ramparts. On the 20th of Ottober a sum
mons was sent in by Gen. Cuftine, to sur
render ; with an afluraiice to the com
mandant of the city, Ki.t#Jkiiing was im

The commandant answered, thit he woulc
defend it to the 21ft. The French port:
were mceifantly cannonaded from the wall:
for upwards of 48 hours by 36 pounders,
but without effect, the balls being spent be
fore they came within 200 yards of tht
campâin the evening a second summon:
was sent in to surrender, which was an
swered with articles of capitulation. Ii
taking this city only one foidier was killec
and two wounded.
The unfortunate French emigrants, whc
have been hitherto cantoned in the Auftri
au low countries, and who have worn the
white cockade and uniform, are now o
bliged to quit these marks of distinction
and to conform to the following mandate:
" The French Emigrants, attached to the
Bourbon princes, ihall remain no where
in the Austrian Netherlands except in the
places marked out for the cantonments oi
the army. All those found elsewhere are
to be arretted, by military force, if neces
sary, and sent back to the army ; and ii
cal'eof the molt trifling re!ifta/ice,to be pu
nished as enemies of the public peace.â
Such emigrants, whether clergy or laymen,
as do not actually keep house, as tenant
or owners, are from and after the 2d o:
November to be conlidered as vagrants,
and puniflied accordinglyâSuch as are no
difqualitied by the preceding article, are tc

Notwithflanding the harvest was plenti

PARIS, October 29.
From every quarter we receive advice:
of the success of the French armies. Tin
republicans have only to shew themfelve:
before a place, and it inrtantly surrenders.
No where have they met with the least re
finance. The expences of the war become
more and more easy ; for the conquerec
towns supply them with the means. Ii:
some cities they raise contributions ; in o
thers they seize upon the church plate, and
melt it into coin, as they have done at
Nice.
They write from Brett, that at the Fete
which took place in that part, on the 18th.
to proclaim the republic, the old names ol
the mips of the line were changed for o
thers more analogous to the circumstance;
of the times.
I he Royal Louis is now called the Re
publican ; the Diadem, Brutus; the Scep
tre, the Convention ; the Two Brothers,
the J alt; the Duke ol Bourgogne, the Peo
ple ; the Duke of Chartres, the Racer ;
tlie Marshal de Caflries, the Cwi'^ir.
Accounts from Lyons state, that Tra
guet is gone to Civita- v'ecchia, or to one
ot the ports of the island of Sardinia : The
latter expedition seems the n.oft probable.
The conquests in the South are spread
ing every where. The convention have ap
plied to the magistracy of Genoa to lane
forces there, but were refufed. The)
threaten likewise to attack Turin, Milan,
and Naples ; but the latter city is ftrongl)
defended with batteries all round the bay.
For the purpose ot these expeditions, tfk
republic has now lying off the Hieres iil
ands, so well known for the render:'. oils o]
admiral Matthews, in the year 1744, wher
lie blocked up the French and Spaiiifl
fleets in the harbour of Toulon, nine mei:
of war and fourteen frigates, &c. on boarc
ot which troops are to be embarked. The)
are likewise getting ready gun and mortal
batteries. Government has hired thirty
transports : All this denotes great activitv
and zeal.

.vhich the duke of Sudermania has always
placed in this minister.
I wo deputies from Franckfort have ap
peared at the bar of the convention, pre
senting a petition from that city to be re
leased from the fine imposed 011 them by
M. de Cuftine. Their memorial was re
ferred to tlie diplomatic committee.
M. de Cuftine had ordered the horses
pd equipage of the elector of Mentz,
found by him in that city, to be publicly
"bid on the 10th inft.
The advance guard of the central army,
no w to be commanded by M. Bournonville,
marched 011 the 6th inft. for Mentz to re
inforce M. de Cuftine. The main body
followed on the 7th and Bth.
The artillery found at Mons consisted ol
p brass cannon, 19 brass mortars and 14
lowitzers ; 107 iron cannon. There were
uio 3000 bombs,3oo,ooo bullets, and 15000
.nil fleets.
Many officers of the ci-devant gardes du
:orps, and other emigrants, havefent peti
:ions to the Generals, requeuing leave to
Return to France, and imploring pity. M.
"Uftine, in a second letter, has entreated
:he national convention to decide upon
heir fate, as also upon the petitions of fe
deral Auftrians, who delire to be released
upon a promile of serving no more againfl
:he republic. The committee of legisla
tion have been ordered to consider this af
fair.
M. Dumourier has sent word to the nati
onal convention of an advantage obtained
by Field Marefchal Omoran over the Au
ftrians at Conde, in which a conliderabk
number ot the latter were killed. Their
wounded, whom they left upon the field,
were carried to Conde and treated witi;
the utmost care.
On the ill of November, the king and
his family, imprifonedin the temple, mads
the following demands of the coinmiffioii
;rs that waited on them : " That the ac
-ount of the expences to be allowed month -
ly should be fixed, in ordeÂ£_that they may
lot exceed themâA phyiician and apothe
cary, to administer such remedies as they
might think properâthe sum of 2000 livre?
laily, for their little expencesâfurniture
ind linen from the Garde Meuble.' The
:wo thousand livres were refufed, but the
commandant of the temple was ordered to
supply them with such little funis as he
(hould think neceflary.
For the National Gazette.
" No might nor greatness in mortality
Can censure 'scape : back-wounding calumny
The whitest virtue strikes."
THIS remark of the poet is strongly ex
emplified in the man, to whom a writer,
under the signature of " Mirabeau," has
offered the just tribute of republican ap
probationâThe early and Heady friend of
his country; the firm but dignified oppo
nent to the trappings of royalty, and the
baubles of nobility ; the friend to merit in
whatever station or whatever garb it may
appear ; the enemy to every fyflem that
would degrade and corrupt the dear
bought principles of republicanism ; no
wonder that lie should incur the resent
ment of the would be noblejfe of the Uni-
ted States; no wonder that he Hiould
draw down upon himfelf their sire-os ven
geance, and the thunder of Catullus and
his glittering host. 44 In every age, in e
very nation, (said the immortal Mirabeau)
the partizans of arillocracy have implaca
bly persecuted the defenders of the peo
ple ; and if, by feme lingular concurrence
ot accidents, any such arose amongst the
members of their own order, he was mark
ed out as the particular object of their
j age, as they were eager to inspire terror
by the fele&ion of the vittim." The man
who has firmnefs enough to brave the al
friults ot the powerful in defence of juii;
principles, and virtue enough to remain
uncorrupted amid temptation; he who
Lonfiders it as a firfl duty to advance the
liappinels and prosperity of his country,
and considers his own as inti
mately incorporated with it, such a man
will meet v.ith the persecution of envy
-ind ambition, but he ought to be regard
ed as a melling to his country, and should
be cherilhed by every son of freedom.
Where are the heart-, I would alk, that
[attained, intrepidly sustained, an ar
iluons conteit for freedom during the late
revolution? Surely they are not all en
tombed in the funding system, the grave of
a brave soldiery; finely they are not all
filled into tie world of spirits to claim
the reward of a well spent life, and the
pittance of liberty which they have fought
lor here in vain : or are they languishing
:n obfeurity, pining with want, and call
ing down curses upon an unjust and an
ungrateful country? I trull the spirit of
Ireedom itiil has a being in America, that
the torch which has been kindled in France
will supply an additional flame, and that
iuftice, honor and gratitude will yet have
n refurreaioti. It has been said by "Mi
rabeau," that the abdication of Mr. Jeffer
(bn is an evil to the United StatesâThis
there can be no doubt of; for tho' he has
been in office near four years, he has ne
ver aliumed the insolence of itâhis deport
ment has been that of a republican, and in
no one aÂ£tion orexpreflion has hemanifeft
ed a superiority over his fellow-citizensâ
Can this be laid of the other officers of our
government ? It is certainiy of the highest
importance to preserve the equality of ci
tizens ; for the moment any one class of
citizens are imprefled with a belief that
they are an inferior order of beings, their
independence is destroyed. and the'ground
work of aristocracy is laid. It would be
well for the people to examine whether
this species of corruption is Mot already at
temptedâTo me it appears demonstra
ble. It is of little moment whether we
have an aristocracy founded upon opinion,
or an aristocracy fanflioned by law ; in
deed, the one will beget the other, and the
effects will be the fame, for we are as
much the slaves of custom as laws can pof
bbly make us. It is said that an officer of
government cannot mix indiscriminately
with citizens, because it will employ too
much of his time, and the affairs of state
will be neglectedâfor this reason he has
fixed days for all to gaze upon him. Du
ring the administration of the grand pen
lionary De Witt the affairs of the republic
of Holland, (and they certainly were not
fewer andlefs important than ours,) were
as faithfully attended to as the affairs ol
any government required, and yet he vifi
tcd and engaged in all the amusements of
the citizensâit is not said whether his ivijt
was lb deeply engaged in the administra
tion, thatfhe was precluded from the com
mon etiquette of social life. Those per
fbus who are received as guests, and are
diftinguiflied by a particular attention,
seem to be a privileged order of men in
our government, and are, at least, a grade
removed from common citizenship ; for no
man can claim the right of equality, who
is excluded from any one privilege that a
nother citizen enjoys. Mr. Jefferfon has
uniformly observed a conduct which har
monizes with the purest principles of re
publicanism, and we have no assurance, if
we reason from what we know, that his
fuccelfor will be untinflured with the fa
ihionable follies of governmental station ;
I therefore conclude with Mirabeau, that
his abdication is an evil. It is not my wish
(God forbid that it should be the wish of
any freeman) that an individual /hould be
weighed in the balance again]} his country;
but when we meet with pure and difm
terefted patriotism, it is a mark of degene
racy not to render it its jtift deserts.

<< The abundant harvests you have been

" Yesterday being the sth of Nov. a.

' Oyes, Oyes, Oyes,
' Fellow Citizens,
' The Duke of Brunfwick having at
tempted to enflaveFrar.ee, in open violati
on of the eternal Rights of ,*lan, and laws
of Humanity and Juflice ; it has been de
termined to make a public example of
him, as well to prevent noble blunders
in future, as to convince mankind, at large
of tiie sUpreme dignity of their nature, anc
the united force of courage and virtue.
The Duke entered France under the mis
taken idea, that the French people were
da tardly enough to bend to the nod oi
princes; but as his confidence and resour
ces lay in his pride rather than in his capa
city, he withdrew, covered with Shame,
Confufion and Dijhonour, after having com
mitted crimes & blunders that have deserv
edly brought upon him the ridicule and
contempt of all Europe. He has had a fair
and impartial trial, and proofs appearing
so strong of his guilt, he is: now to atone tor
his rash temerity. His cafe will prove that
men poflefs masculine minds, and that at
the close of the 18th century, when en
lighted by science and reflection, they will
not be sported with, nor futfer tyrants of
any kind to escape with impunity !

jth day of November, one thousand

name of Liberty, Ejuality and the
Rights of Man.
" He was then executed in due form,
and after hanging the usual time, was set
fire to and consumed to alhes, together
with his gallows, amidst the (houts and ac
clamations of an immense concourse ot
spectators, who immediately after dispers
ed and retired to their refpeitive homes, in
the utmost tranquility and good order."
We learn by a private letter from Dub
lin, that the commotions in Ireland are
confiderableâlt fays, " That a paper was
fixed up in Dublin on the Barrack and C;<f
tle gates, with the words, NO KING AND
LIBERTY : On which a privy council
was called, and orders given to the com
mander in chief to repair to the barracks â
there, he interrogated, whether they knew
or were privy to the porting up of laid pa
pers ? they all remained silent ; he then
informed tliem, that if any of them were
difatisfied with the service, they might be
discharged, but no answer was returned.
Next morning a frefh paper, to the fame
purport, appeared on the fame places ; on
which a Royal Proclamation was issued, in
â¦ .hich the Lord Lieutenant and Council
d, " That if any soldier should be
deteftpd in porting up any seditious paper,
or, on oath should be proved, privy there
to, he should receive 500 ladies, and be ex
pelled the service ; and, if any foreigner
should be dete&ed, having the book enti
tled the Rights of man, -written by Tlwmas
Paine, he should be indicted as a felon."
" A citizen observes, that now titles in
the civil line are dying daily, it is high
time those in the ecclesiastical ihould be a
bolilhed. To give the title of Reverend to
any man, he he who he may, is not only an -
ti-republican, but absolutely blasphemousâ
Reverend only belongs to the Supreme Be
ingâwe read, " holy and reverend is his
name''âno more of your reverends among
poor frail mortals." [Boston Gaz.] To
this might be added, that the title of the
iuperior clergy is absurd : when a Biftop
is Oyled a Rig'it Reverend ; it is evidently
implied that the whole host of the inferior
clergyarelVrong Reverends ; and that ma
ny of them are moll woefully on the ititong
tide of the question, in point of temporal
enjoyments, every day's observation may
teftifyâwitnefs many of the curates in
England performing the subordinate ser
vice of two or three parilhes, for 15 or 20
pounds a year ! â
It is (aid, that some of the German fe
males, who are intermarried with the Bri
cilh royal family, have been endeavouring
to form a party, to propose to the parlia
ment an interference favourable to the
BrunfwickandPrullianwaragainft France;
jut the plan was over-ruled in the privy
:ouncil. Whether the queen has been a
nember of this party is uncertain : it is
aid however, with confidence, that (he has

lay of evil thing; in Great Britain.
A Cadiz paper mentions, that a comraev
:ial treaty is certainly negociating between
:he Court of Madrid and the United States
of America ; and many of the Cadiz me'r
;hants were in high spirits, in hopes that it
must Drove considerably beneficial,not only
to their country in general, but to themselves
in particular.
The intelligence in our last, of a truce
having taken place between the Austrian
and French armies (received by way of
Boston) appears to be without foundation.
Accounts from Portugal (late that ths
queen is absolutely mad, coniidered as in

of Prince Regent.
On Friday last arrived at New-York, a
vefi'el in 49 days from Havre de Grace, and

the former accounts of the combined ar

trian Netherlands being almolt wholly in
the hands of the French; and the king of
Sardinia absolutely deprived of the greater

tyrannic governments, under which they
have groaned for so many fuccellive ages.
Gen. Fayette continues closely confined
in the state prison of Spandau, in Pruflia ;
to which he was removed from Wefel, in
Luxembourg. He lu.s been several times
in danger of losing his life, from the exas

Seven of the Wabajlt Indians, lately ar

William Stabler, who lately abfeonded
from his creditors in this city, has been

Intimations are given in a Boston paper,
that Le Courier Politique de PUtiivers, a
new French and English paper, printed at

speedily pronounced by all free Ameri

A Protest against the French revolution
has been recently entered in the office of a
notary public in Boston, by 24 Frenchmen,
there resident. Common complailance to
the prevailing opinions of a nation ought
tuput gentlemen upon their guard, in at
tempts of this nature. We distinguish be

and altho' we would disdain to persecute
the few remaining friends of the latter,

Teems to require a refpectful silence.

A letter from a member of Congress to

or the jaws of the cavern of darkness are

It is mentioned in the Pittfburg Gazette,
that the moment Congress cedes the coun

[From the Stockbridge Weflern Star, of

â¢' Many of the officers of the late army,
have petitioned, and are again about peti
tioning Congress, for further compenjation.
It is almost needless to mention that
the country at a time it was under
the molt embarralling circumftauces,
(trained every nerve to make lip the
stipulated commutation, under the ful
led perfualion, that no further claim
would be made on the government !
Are these gentlemen, in general, ina bet
ter or worse situation now, than they
were at the time they entered the army ?
If it appears to you, as it does to me, that
enough has already been done for those
officers, you will be cautious not to vote
for fu:h who are intereftediit applications
to Congress, to make further allowances
for Jervices during the late war.''''âAnd
again,â"The officers of the late Continen
tal army have been for some time pad pe
titioning Congress for further compensa
tion for their services ; this measure,
though a darling one to them, is, never
thelels, a very unpopular one, and, in rnj
opinion, a very unreasonable one ; foi
however great their merits, they were as
amply rewarded, as the circumllances of
the country would admit, or as they real
ly ought to be, under those circumOances;
for if their demands are just, (being found
ed merely on the depreciation of their pay,]
not a citizen scarcely in the United States,
but has a demand as well founded, for de
preciation of pay for Victualling, cloathina
and foraging the army ; and fhculd ali
these demands be allowed, the revenues
of the United States would not be a fund
adequate to the discharge of the interest.'
The good news from France ought tt
give joy to all mankind, as it opens a prof
peSt of happiness to the whole humar
rate âsuch a profpeft as the history of the
world hardly, it at all, affords, from the
earliest periods to the present day. Man
kind have, for many ages, been kept under
bondage and oppression, and their rights
have so long been disregarded by their ru
lers, that they seem totally to have lofl
fight of them, and forgot that they had anj
rights 2t all. They have been taught tc
look upon their rulers as theirmaflers, and
theinfelves as made for government, and
not government for them, i. e. solely for
their benefit. King-craft and prieft-crafl
combined, have, for ages, kept the human
mind in fetters, and the world in the moll
slavish state ofignorance and bondage ; but
the revolution in America has called up
the attention of the world to these impor
tant fubjefts : The mystery of iniquity be
gins to be unveiled, ignorance and fuper
tfition are rapidly retiring before the illu
minating influence of Common Ser.fe, and
tyranny literally retreating before the
Rights of Man ; and it is hoped the world
will soon be convinced, that neither ty
rants nor slaves will be able to ward off
the attacks of Paine.
[From a late London Paper.
Great Britain is to supply the French
with every neceflary they want for the e
quipment of their troop;. It feeins that
this country is to cloath as well as feed
them. One merchant only in this city has
received an order for cloth to the amount
of 80,0001. fteriing. Another order for the

value of 2j,0001. Another house has :e

than double the price of what this article
used to cost in France, before the revolu

Mr. Freheau,
THE following amiable, and truly beco-
Wing picture ol the French,and French re
volution is taken from the Connefiicut Cou
rant (printed at Hartford) of January 7.
Sorry I am that any writers in America
should be l'o vile and prostituted as uni
formly to abuse a Revolution which is re
vered by every friend to freedom, and ca
lumniated in this country only by the base
tools of ariftoci acy i,nd monarchy. The
discerning reader will on perusal, cry out
Expede Sat an am.
15 The French finding themselves duped
by c;ie religion, they reuerally imbibed a
â Jifgult again ft all. They took but one itep
from bigotry to infidelity. Few 01 them
retained a reverence for chriltianityâfew
of them flopped even at deism. They be
came generally, and now are sceptics.â
They called in queffion the being and at
tributes of the Deity. They doubted the
immortality of the foul, and denied a fu
ture state of rewards and punishment. This
mutely system of doubt and scepticism,
borrowed from the atheillic tenets of Epi
curus, Hobbs, and Spinoza, is at length be
come the prevailing creed in France, and
dignified by the name of modern philolb
phy.
The druggies of the nation against mo
narchical deipotifm have been marked by
the fame want of moderation, and ftil.l
more disgraced by the violence of the paf
lions. From this source have been derived
all the misfortunes, which they have hi
therto felt, and which for a considerable
time they mult cccciiarily continue to feel.
France had it in her power to have been
happy, almost by a lingle tffort. At an
early period of the contest, the king open
ly favored a reformation in government.
The firit exertions gave to the people, an
house of representatives, by free election.
This is the grand security of liberty, and
110 nation while it continues, can ever be
enslaved. The circumrtances of France,
totally different from thole of America, na
turally pointed out for them a oonftitution
limilar to that of Great-Britain, but which
Ihould extend more equally the rights of
fuftrage, and he better guarded against the
arts of corruption and the influence of the
court. The king readily submitted to a
fufficient limitation of his prerogative. A
Senate might have been constituted fr; m
the chief of the nobility as in England, or
perpetuated as in Scotland by free elec
tion : And the house of representatives
would have formed a fufficitnt barrier a
gainrtallul'urpationsof monarchical orarif
tocratical power. This was the plan of
the amiable, but unfortunate Marqriis La
Fayette. He fell a vittim to his own mo
deration, and the violence of his ene
mies.
For the leaders of the French revoluti*
on, having succeeded indeftro)inga ty
rannical government, made an immediate
attack on government itfelf. Happily bro
ken loose from the chains of liefpotifm,
with all the enthtifiafm of newly recovered
freedom, and all the madness of revenge
ful passion, they rushed headlong into per
fect anarchy. They inculcated the pure
doctrines of levellifm. They d.throned
the king, degraded the nobility, banifhetl
the clergy, confifcated an immei fe pro
perty by a vote, mafi'acred thoufancis v ith
out a trial, and after having been guilty of
more wanton atts of tyrannical barbarity,
than have in this century disgraced all the
annals of despotism, have left their Nation
al Aflembly, without power, and without
afliflance, to be governed and insulted by
the mob of Paris.
The author of the defence of the Ame
rican confiitutions searched all history for
the illuflration of his political opinion ;
but he found not so glaring a proof the ne
ceiiity of proper checks and ballances in
government, as has been since furnilhed in
the course of the French revolution, by
the conduct and success of the Jacobin
faction."

pends of the war department. He de
clared hi [life If superior to any persona!
corifideraiions. or of private pique against
the Secretary of War; and in refpeft to
the Pr fident of the United States, he
prof 'Jed the warmed attachment to his
person and charaÂ£ter. In coming for
wai !on thin occasion, he was actuated by
motw.s of public conlideiation, from a
convx u on that the system now pursued
won ove perni ious in the end.
â¢ â  r \ ... fworth rose to explain: he
difcivmed all personal considerations ; hÂ«
thought 1 imfelfas much superior to them
as the gentleman i -ft speaking. The modi
of treating the fubjeel adopted by tha'
gentleman had dr. wn forth some remark:
from him, which he considered as ltriAl)
proper, and which be fliould not have dons
his duty not to have made.
Mr. Hartley was again ft adopting th<
motion under the prelent circumltauces o:
the country, and he entered into a parti
cu'ir inveitigation of the merits of th<
qneflionâWhen the last law for the more
effectual pr reftion of the frontiers pa (Ted
the fubjedt now under confederation wa.
very fully and ably difcufied, and the gen
tlemen who were averse to the augmenta
tion, had ieveral alterations made to satis
fy them.
Inflead of the President's being obliged
to raise the whole of the three regiments,
he was to exercise his difcrstion either tc
make the augmentation complete, or raise
a part, and had authority to disband them
after raised. The rath feftion of the law
is thus expiefTed, " That it shall be law
ful for the President of the United States
to forbear to raise, or te disband after they
shall be raised, the whole or any part ol
the three additional regiments in cafe e
vents shall in his judgment render his fc
doing confident with the public fafety."
We fh uld therefore consider, vvhethei
circumflances have so materially changer
since that time as to render it proper thai
the legifbture fliould interfere, repeal the
powevs given to the Prefidcnt, and dis
charge the three regiments.
This necessarily leads us firft, to view
the fi'ua ion of our finances, and the state
of the frontiers at, and immediately be
fore the time of palling the law.
The extent of our revenue was not as
well known then as at present, and every
good man deprecated the misfortune
which obliged him to encreafe the taxes.
The war was a disagreeable one, but
neceflary, if peace could riot be otherwifi
obtained.
The legislature considered the expence
and were of opinion, that we had mean;
and abilities to defray the fame.
Many murders and ravages had beer
' committed by the savages on the fron-
army had fuffered in the yeai
1790, and nearly a whole army cut off or
the 4th of November 179 1. And wt
have every reason to suppose, that the In
dians wou d ail in great force against us.
Our finances are (till refpedlableâit i:
true, I fliould be happy if we could apply
the money towards uifcharging the na
tioiral debt already contra&ed, but the un
fortunate situation of ourfrontitrs prevents
it.
Warâthough an evil, may (from the
present disposition of the world) be some
times neceflary, when nations are unrea
sonable, and justice cannot be otherwifc
had.
Hostilities have lately been committed
on our troops commanded by Major A
dair, and several of the southern tribes
shew themselves inimical, and we have no
absolute assurances that we shall have peace
in the springâThe agreement by forre
tribes to a fufpeniion of hostilities, was
convenient to them, as it prote&ed their
tainiliss for the winter.
If the great object of the additional ar
mament wa3 io obtain peace; Sethis is not
yet eftc-fted, may we proivi fe ourselves
more 1 uccefs in negociation by laying
dowa our arms, or by retaining them ?
History is in favor of the latter.
Indeed I hold it as a maxim, that the
nation, which is prepared for war, can
molt ealily obtain peace. For my owa
part, I tan discover no exiting causes ior
altering the system established by the a<Â£fc,
to which I have before referred.
i he expence has been made a very seri
ous obje&ion: it ought to have weight; but
where measures have bten proper, Ame
rica has not regarded it. She has freely
expended her treasure to support her
rights.
We are bound in juflice and honour to
protect our fellow citizens on the frontiers:
we demand from them an exciseâThey
require from the general government pro
tection.
I am for making peace with all the In
dians upon reafonablg terms ; but any
country that has been fairly purchased
from the Indians, they should not be per
mitted to re pol'. fs or hold by conquelt.
If an ofFenfive war be neceflary, fays
the gentleman from N. Carolina, regiiflar
troops are not the mod proper to carry ft
on, i hey .ire more expensive and uypfit
to meet the fava ;cs of the wilderness. As
to the expence I have partly answered be
i ore ; but if the gentleman is to have five
expeditions in one year, I be'ieve he would
find that his calculations are not corrcCi :
u misfortune to either detachment or pr.r
'Y would bear very hard upon the diftrift
ihey came from ; the partial loss of regu
<\r'â¢?, would not be equally felt, very few
sf them having families.
I have a hig.'i opinion of the back-wood d
riflemen, but I am confident that we can
n t certainly rely upon their turning out
is often as they might be wanted ; we
rould not relv on such uncertainty, and
yet this isjoffered as a favorre projedt.
If you cannot rely upon them, you may
ay that the ordinary militia can be draft
id, you would find them unfit for such a
.ervice, they would in general be comnof
;d of substitutes unexperienced and undif
cipliried, and it would be unfair to take
ihem all from the frontiers, & foineof tht
dates, or lealt one, have no militia lawsâl
am for retaining the regular troops.
ihe Prefidcnt has prat.ifed ceconomy
in organizing the troops voted for, and I
im tolJ they have made considerable pro-
in discipline ; they are formed intc
legionary corps, composed cf horse, rifle
men, lighi-infantry, and battalion men,
The three former will be fit for a&i\e fer
"ice in the field, the latter for the com
mon duties of the camp or garrison. The
printer mistook my expreflion the othei
Jay in speaking of regular troops. Inlteac
r>f faying, there was no instance where re
?ular troops had been beat by Indians ;
I mentioned " there was no initance dur
ing the late war where regular troop;
were beat by an equal number of Indians.
[ here repeat the lame observation.
I will allow volunteers and militia thei;
ull credit ; but I do not think the regu
lar tro ps merit the disparagement at
LCii.p.edâVolunteer corps have not bee
free from misfortunes.
Colonel Crawford at the head of yoc
volunteers from Virginia and Pennfylvc
ma, v-as defeated in the weflern country,
add he was burnt at the (take. General
Braddock, it is said, was obstinate, arc
his European troops were undifciplinrj
for such a service. The army under Ge
neral bt. Cinir was 1011, becanfe the mei
were undisciplined and unfitted for the ser
vice.
I can mention several inilances where
regular troops have penetrated the Indi
p.n country, among warlike tribes, with
iuccef.i: Colonel Montgomery into the
Cherokees ; Col, Arroftrong to the Kit
tanig ; Colonel Boquet's campaign ol
1763 and 1764. Three detachments ol
the American army in the year 1 778 ; one
undei the command of Gen. Broadheud ;
one under Lieut, Col. Butler, and the lafl
commanded by your humble servant, pene
trated the country possessed by the fix na
tions. Neither of the detachments was
large j and the la'l had to contend againfl
superior numbers.
In Gen. Sullivan's campaign the year
following, his vsn-guard beat an equal, if
not a superior number of Indians.
I might mention the Roman legions ;
they almost constantly were fuccefsfal a-
gainst those they called barbarians, until
their enemies adopted the Roman disci
pline.
1 reprobate the idea of a ftandingarmy
which might endanger the of this
country ; but I consider the troops con
templated in the ast of Congress, to be
nbfolutcly neceflary until peace (ball be ob
tained : and therefore shall vote againlt a
reduction.
Every step has been taken, and I dart
fay will be pursued by the Prelidcnt, topro
cure a peace without bloodlhed. Our
meflengers of peace have in some places
been murdered, and yet he has sent ir.ef
fengers to others.
I have a high opinion cf the persona!
bravery and ptowefs of an Indian ; but
I do deny that they can a<& to the best ad
vantage in large bodies. They have not
an experience of that kind ; difciplintd
troops would have the advmtageâWhen
I speak of disciplined troops, I mean s
uifciphne fitted to the country and enemy
they are to ast against.
To be continued.
