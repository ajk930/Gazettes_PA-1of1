In the Debate on
The New Representation Bill,
The House beit* in committee of the whole,â
On motion to fill up the blank tor the ratio oi
Reorefentatian with thirty three tboufand,â
Ik ,7R. Gii.V.s observed, that although this
iyl fuhjett has been heretofore thoroughly
if,.culled, and rfir minds of gentlemen piobablv
faii*uod wirK the cifeuflion, yet he could no
help tref -attire upon the patience of the commit
tee, hy mentK>mne feme of the principal reafowi
which would influence hjs vote against the mo
tion, and in favor of that ratio which will as
lord the greate.lt number of repreftntatives, au
choriiaJ pv the c-mrtitut'-on. He wasirtduced tj
do this from an that in thÂ« usual court
of things arguments wilt have an efFctf upon th,
public mind in /./me mealure proportionate t<
their own felidfcy* and the purity of the motive

tÂ»o objeaions to fuhmitting his reasons *o the ap

however to confine himfclf to general remarks
and not to fatigue-the committee unnsceffarii;
with a minute exemplification of them.
He proceeded by.obfarving, tnat the expreflio:

in favor of an increased reprrfentation, at leal* a

the convention# which adopted the constitution ;
that it was further evidenced by the several le

To the inequality of representation relatively
to stares suggested to result from the applicatior
of this ru\e, Mr. Gile-s replied that the inequali
ty complained of is rather ideal than real $ tha
to determine how far this confederation reallj
ought to amongst states, from the reafoi
and nature of the cafe, it is right and proper t<
aiccrtaiji the whole comparative governmental in
fiuence of the Â»efpe6live slates proportioned tt
numbers 5 to do this it is necefTary to the
whole organization of the government, and the
jfiue of this enquiry will be, that those states, ir
whose favor the rul-e is said to operate, polfefi
the least governmental influelice in the Senate,
proportioned to numbers j and that the cafuai
gain hrte is no equivalent for the certain lofj
as as the governmental in
tiuence of,ftate.s in relation to numhers, is to ope
rate, it will furnifh a motive of preferment foi
the fule he contended for.
It hasL been laid, continued Mr. Giles, tha;
the representation of the ftaieS in the Senate, is
ftri&ly defined by the cenftitution, and that there
fore the confideratiep of the relative influence ol
the states there, (hould not be resorted to as an
argument in the apportionment of representatives
to this l>oufe, but it Ihould be observed that the
rule contended for, though not so ftri&ly defined,
is equally within the pale of the conllitution, and
the most extended use to be made of this coniider
ation, is to manifeft the impropriety of resorting
to the pretended inequality amongst states, as a
conclusive argument, to vary thar ratio of repre
sentation for tfeis house, which is admitted to be
tfce SBoft proper upon its iptrinfic merits, and
when viewed without a reference to that consi
deration. This particular fubjeft suggests a pecu-
Jiar equity and propriety, in taking into confe

bers, because .it is in confluence of a reprefenr
ition by states there that they gain this unequa
nfiucnce, and nothing more is contended tor kw
his rule than a reprrfentation of the people thro
:he meaium of the several states here. The rul
>f representation is not the caufo of the pretend
:d inequality, as far as it may appear to exist, i
& a mere contingent circuitiftance, depending up
>n arbitrary ladts and numbers, which cannot b
â¢endfered subservient to any general rule : i
foould also be remarked, that moll of the ftatt
uppofed to lwÂ» favored by the operation of this rule
lave \ Â«retofore been unequally reprfcfenicd in the Xe
icme, and from the extent and rapid population o
hefe states, comparatively, to other*. it may be con
rludcd with certainty, that prt-vioufly to the expira
tion of the present apportionment, the real i nequa
lity of, representation in this houle, as well as th
fenatc,-will continue to bear particularly hard upoi
them. Perfect equality is unattainable, and th<
proposed ratio is in the principle equally fubjeÂ£
with any other to all the inconveniencies whict
it is intended to remedy.
The inconveniencies of the rule he contender
for, jn their utmost extent can never be ven
great, because the lame rule is applied in the fami
manner to the refpeÂ£tive states, and the most ex>
tended scope for it* unequal operation, must b(
confined to the casual result of the fractions
numbers within the several dates. In jefle&iftj
upon this argument of inequality of representa
tion in relation to frates, an idpa had preJentec
itfelf io his mind which seemed to him both no
vel and important, and that ij>Â» that a quality
exifis in the government, from its peculiar orga
niration, wl.ich enables a minority of constitu
ents, through the medium of a majority of repre
sentatives, to give law to a majority of" constitu
ents, absolutely against the will of their minorit)
of representatives. This quality of the govern
rnent arises from the state representations in th<
fen ate, and it exists not merely in ("peculation 01
idea, it has heen sensibly felt in practice, ant
there is a real tendency in the government, frorr
its peculiar ttxture, to make it ft ill more so.â
The very kill now under confjderation will pro
bably fuvnilh one strong evidence of KS efticacy ir,
practice ; it wou>d have palled very ditferentl)
from the present proposition if it had not mei
with this unnatural check j and 1 am concerned,
said he, to remark, that in almoll every impor
tant meafore of the government, the minorifv
of the people of the union had given laix
to the majority of the people, against their
qonfent, as far as this can be evidenced through
the medium of their representativeÂ». This, jt is
to be feared, is a radical evil in the government,
jnd its magnitude would be in a great measure
proportioned to the extention of the objects of le
gislation by this government. it (he people be
the only legal foutce of governmental authority,
and the rights of individuals be equal, this is
certainly a In terodoy principle, in the government
He would irot pretend to fay, however, that this
was a cancer upon the body politic, too inve
terate and vital to admit of a cure ; but he con
ceived it to be a fore of that fort, which it would
be unwise to irritate or tamper with ; and he con
ceived also, the present proposition not to be
with out-its irritating qualities.
Mr. Giles then proceeded to cop.fider i:pr>n .gen
eral principles, the expediency of i recreating the re
presentation in this House to the full extent au
thorifv:d by the cdnftitution/'aod particularly with
a view to the neceility of establishing, in this
branch of the government, a permanent iympachy
with the landed interest. He observes that all re
presentative governments appeared to poflefs a na
tural tendency from republicanism to monarchy,
or ariftocracv, that great inequalities in the dilti i
bution of wealth amongst individuals, confequen!
upon the progress of all governments, appeared tc
have been the truecaufe of these political evolu
tions, that no competent remedy ag-ainft this evi
had been heretofore discovered, or at leait pra&i
cally applied by any government, that perhaOs this
great political light may firft ihine forth thro' the
medium of the American conftitutibns, and f?rve,
as fyme others have previoully done, to illuminate
not only the American, but the European world,
The peculiar circumstances of the United States,
however, since the late revolivtion, and in the in
fancv of the American governments, favored ex
tremely this natural principle of the growing ine
quality in the distribution of wcaUh amongst indi
viduals ; an extensive, unexhausted, fertile coun
try furnifliea full scope for agnculture : the plen
ty and cneapnefs of provisions rnd rude materials
for manufa&urcs, and an un(hack!ed commerce
for the merchant } and to these were added the
blefling? of peace, and laws securing to the indivi
dual the exclusive pofiefiion of the fruits of his
own industry, however abundant. These were in
trinsic circumstances 5 there was a contingent one.
A public debt, the price of the revolution itfelf
and its consequent blefiings, had been incurred,
and from the imbec-ility of the then existing con
federacy and other causes, was depreciated consi
derably below its nominal value j but it was then
in tmall mafTes, and not very unequally spread
amongst the individuals throughout the whoil
United States. The government of the Uni
ted States, instead of managing this contingent
cJrcumftance with caution and delicacy in its ad
ministration, seized upon it with avidity, and in
all its fifcal arrangements, applied it as the most
powerful machine to stimulate this growing ine
quality in the diftributio#'of wealth, a principle
perhaps too much fevered by other exiting causes.

On the Secretary's Report en the Excise.
(Continued from our last. )
IN the 7th page of the report, the Secre
tary continues his vindication of the ex
cise law, from the charge of injuring induf
trv, and interfering with the bufinefsof dis
tilling : but jn order to give a fair investi
gation to the fubjeft, I beg leave to make a
final! digression from the general argument,
and to review the circumstances in which
this manufacture is involved, together with
the characters or those citizens, who are
principally interested in it. The stills em
ployed in extracting ardent spirits from
grain and fruit, are, with few exceptions,
O- the fmaLer kind, in capacity generally
from 50 to ico gals, and being considered
a; the family vefiels of the plantation are
turned to many domestic uses, belides that
of preparing spirits. For this purpose', how
ever, they are frequently employed for
some weeks before the frols set in hard,
during t ' lef s Pr ig ! which seasons are
Ciio 1211 not only because they are proper for
carrying on the business, but because the
other labours of the farm are no: then so
urgent. In those parts of the country in
deed, where the ftilh are mod necefTarv
the lituatio.ii rtie water would not gen
erally permit their going on during the
froft in winter, or the dror.ght in summer :
nor at thcfe periods could the (tills supply
:hemâ¢ But even if tliefe causes cchild be
â¢emoved (which is impossible) there is nei
ther grain nor fruit to keep them all em
ployed through the season ; perhaps not the
enth (till that is in the country would be
onftantly supplied ; nor would there be a
lemai'd for the tenth gallon that, in
that cafe, might be diftilied. With respect
:o the material; for distillation, they might
ie procured in fufficient quantities, not on
y ior the whole eonfhmption of ardent fpi
"its in the United States, but to supply an
ibundant exportation to other countries ;
uid were it brought to perfection, I repeat,
hat from long and attentive observation
itid experience, I know it to be the most
.vholefome, apple liquor perhaps excepted,
)f all ardent spirits.
That the foil is capable of producing ma
terials to ahnoft any given extent, Will not
>e qneftioned, and that (tills are owned and
employed almost exclusively by the farmers
except indeed such as have been erected
n the country since the excise law was ori
ginated] cannot be denied ; but the ex
:ent and nature of the nfes, and value of
:he diflilleries, demand some enquiry.
During the course of the late war, the
bufmefs ofdiftilling spirits from home pro
duce became very profitable, not only on
the account of the want of a foreign de
mand for our produce, butalfo, becaafe fo
reign spirits and molaff ceased to be im
ported as usual ; and the army increased
the demand for spirituous liquors ; it was at
this crisis that the legislature of Pennfylva
:iia attempted to levy an excise, not so much
n order to raise a revenue as to prevent a

ation, least bread for the army (hoiild th.re
-3y be rendered Scarce. âBut as soon as corn-
Tierce relumed its wonted channels at the
"eturnoor. r peace, and foreign spirits and mo
affe's for distillation, were imported as ufu
il, the demand for whisky, in the old fet
tlemenc >, ceased ; and the (tills, which had
.here been numerous, retreated to the re
siles of the mountains, and the (hades of
:he western woods, where the use of them
s the result of uecelfity, there being neither
tyder nor beer, for an cxhilerating and re
torative draught, nor any other poflible
node of reducing the produce of their
arms into a portable form, capable of be
ng transported to a market so distant as the
>nly one to which they 11111 (t have reccwrfe.
.The whisky is uled in the families, and
;iven to the labourers of thoft peifons who
either keep the (till, or procure their pro-
Juce to be diftilied ; but is by no means in
general use in those parts of the country,
rom which wheat and flour are brought to
.he market. I hose farmers, who have not
tills of their own, generally bring country
um home in their waggons, for family and
larvelt purposes: they find, that there is
nore profit in felling the r grain, and that
i much less quantity of rum. being (trouper
md rougher in proportion to its proof, is
"ufficient for their demand.
In the parts more distant, rum cannot be
>btained, but at a very high price, and it is
generally too of a bad quality ; yet, even
Jetween 3 and 400 miles from Philadel
phia, I have frequently calied at taverns
or a refre(hment, when I could get no
hing but rum ; â(I have, indeed, gone into
Jther taverns in some towns, in order to
nix the water that I had to drink with
â¢vhilky : finding it much eaiier ,>n the fto
nach than such imported spirits as were in
ife) and, I am well informed, that this has
requently been the cafe, with many travel
ers, on their journey from Philadelphia to
Pittlburgh. Whilst I am thus dealing in
legatives, I will (peak of the practices at
ome places, in which I can appeal to the
Secretary himfelf, for the truth of what I
ilfert. WhiJky is not to be found in the
avern.sat New-York, Philadelphia, or Bal
imore ; nor is it to be found in those cities,
>r in (imilar eftablifliments, in the houfesof
he wealthy, nor in the dwellings even of
he poorcit or the poor. 1 have even ob
erved, that when the criminals were put
o public labour in Philadelphia, they wefe
lot infnlted with whisky, or rather, it could
lot be got for their supply ; but they had
um carried along with them to their work,
.t is not exported to foreign countries, nor
rom one (tane to another by sea ; âin (liort,
vherever money is plenty, and prompt pay
n?nt in faihion, there are 110 waggons or
)ack-horfeÂ»loaded with whisky, to be seen
'iliting the markets. I a(k where is the
;rocery, where is the tavern, where is the
Iram-ltiop in Philadelphia, in which it is to
>e found In all thtfe places, however,
â¢um of different qualities is to be purcha
ed in abundance. But let us reafou now
n the affirmative.
I will proceed to give the most accurate
ind candid information of the price of
vhifky in the different parts of Pennfylva
lia, though this information will be other
ivife applied afterwards, when I come to
;reat of the jultice and policy of the excise
aw.
t will firft preinife, that I do not design
to take notice of the fluctuation in the price
as whisky, ariung from the alarming appre
tien(ions occasioned by the firft appearance
t)f the excise law, and its unequal and de
fehve operation. The expefiiHion of a
rife in the price to be promoted by
:he general resolution of the farmers to Jay
ifide their dills, which,! believe the greater
lumber ofthetn did for some time, and an
ixpeStatiorl that o much greater demand
vould be created by the army, than actual
y did happen, occlioned a temporary fife
n the price of whisky, with more probable
eafon than can be afiigncd for the rife of
:ertificates last winter, however, the whif
cy, like the certificates, soon fell again.
But to return. The average cadi price
>f whisky, when cash could be had, was
lorn two (hillings to two (hillings and fix
>ence, and instances have happened of its
>eing fold at three (hillings, when it was
nade very good and kept up until scarce,
but this depended upon chances, for I ne
'er saw any iold at that price except a ve
y few gallons at a time, when it was scarce)
>ut I remember, a few years ago, when I
vas in the Western country and stood in
teed of some whilky, a man brought me a
oad at two (hillings, and I believe I could
lare procured much more at the fame price.
iven last October, when the excise law and
he demand for the army had their effert,
happened to refrefh myfelf at a tavern in
he mountains beyond Bedford, when fe
â eral western farmers \iert packing their
vhilky down the road, the tavernkeeper
:urchafed a (ingle keg at three Shillings a
gallon, and paid but part of the money j
lowever. the man was glad of theopportu
lity, tho' he had the trouble of balancing
.he other keg, I believe, with a stone, con"
equently neither shortened his journev nor
â afed his horse : he came from the neigh
:or.iood of Pittlhurg.
In the old countries, contiguous to the
iufqufhannah, the storekeepers have gene
ally purchased whisky from one (hilling and
en pence to two and four pence per gallon,
lelivered by the owner at the store, and not
>aid till the money could be made of it.
rod even then part payable in goods. I
cnew of an i:iftance of eight barrels tranf
>orted to a considerable distance and foicl
it one (hilling anti eight pence a gallon.
i.ven the last year it was taken from the
emoteft parts of Chester county to Con
orel, S:c. and only two (hillings and lix
>ence a gallon a(!:ed for it. For the truth
>f these stats ments I appeal to the store
keepers and diitiiiers in the parts to which
have alluded. I have been particular in
ny enquiries ever since the hateful idea of
in internal excise was suggested to the pub
ic ; I am no distiller myfelf, nor have I
:ver been, but for three winters past I have
inquired at the moil refpeclable distillers
rom the we:tern country, who were mem-
of aifembly, and others, and they have
lad but one \ oice in declaring that they die
lot receive as much money annually foi
heir whilky. as would have paid nine cent:
i gallon 011 the quantity thev distilled, tho'
t in many refpefts answered thepurpofe o!
noaey to them. I have stated the price:
)f whisky from the Ohio until I came a:
ieai Philadelphia as whi(ky is in demand.
inc 1 the result is, that two (hillings and
jence is the higiieft average ready monej
5i ice that can be admitted into calculatior
n fettled times, even if the excise law wa:
11 operation ; for it is to be observed, thai
:ile state ekcife lawexifted in the times tc
which I allude. But it may be said, thai
die Rate excise on home produce was noi
:oileÂ£ted : granted ; but though it was no'
collected, it was an excuse to keep up the
:>rice : and are we lure that the present ex
sife Will be faithfully collected among :
people, who think it radically unjuit, anc
have habitual prepoflefiions against it.
It is but juit to observe that the people oj
Pennsylvania are well disposed to pay pub
lic taxes that are levied upon the princi
ples of equality, this is evident by the ve
ry heavy taxes they have always' paid, ef
pecially (ince the revolution ; their com
pliance with the requilitions and over-pro
portions of public creditors they made pro
vilion for, is a proof of this ; and that th<
western counties were not the most back
ward in paying their quotas, notwithftand
ng their recent diftre'ies, is evidenced h
â he records of the late treasury. That the : -
liave been foremoit in paying the heavy ok
arrearages to the land office, the records o.
that office are a Handing memorial.
Whiikev not being a cash article, nor :
merchantable commodity in the ufua
li . tints of commerce, and its confumptioi
being very much limited to particular situ
ations, its average ready money price can
not be eafijy ascertained : as it is rarelj
stored any where in great quantities, <
sudden demand in a particular place ma:
occasion a local and temporary rife in the
price. However, I must make free tc
question the Secretary's information res
pecting it, he teiU us in the report, page 15
that whisky is raised in the market, by the
excise law, from 38 to 50 cents a gallon
I wilh I knew his vouchers for this ftate
inent: he is not accustomed to admit the
Imalleft demand against the treasury, with
out luflicient documents. I hope he wil
not expert a law to be enacted, which maj
endanger â  the peace, and has alread)
wounded the happiness of many deserving
citizens, without unquestionable authoritj
for the farts by which the justice thereof ii
to be supported, I wilh to know where
under vrh it circumfbscer. enrt i* whnf
quantities foch prices have been paid. From
rhe caufts I have jnsntioned, it* mav have
varied in the price, as much within ay ir
part", as public stock has done, bur these in
stances are no proper data on which to fix
111 average price.
When we refieft that, until within this
:en or twelve years, whilky was ufuailv
rarried from the old settlements, and fold
nt five Ihillings a gallon in the country
weft of the mountains ; and since tliat time
t has been manufactured and fold there in
abundance at two shillings, we would
;xpe<t:that a wife financier, or prudent- le.-
;iflaturc would contemplate the' probability
>t its being much cheaper as population
ind industry increased. When that coun
ty has advanced so much in twenty years
last, under the almost constant prefTures of
â var, what may we not rationally expect
t to da in twenty years of peace ?
In the old settlements, which are witfr
n the reach of ihe market for their oro
luce, a prohibition of whisky would not be
' er >' severely felt : their grain and cyder
:hey can dispose of : and the apples, which
all too scon, or which are not fit for cyder
hey can always give (as was the cafe with
nany during the last season) to fatten their
logs.
But let us pursue the enquiry into and
>ver the mountainsâThe peculiar cir
:um(Â£ances of the settlements in those dif
.rifts have not fallen under the perfbnal
)bfervation of the Secretary, nor of the
nembers of the Senate ; and are praÂ£ii
:ahy known to a very fmail proportion of
he liouie of Representatives, under the
â¢xiffing distribution of the members. I
wili describe the diuant settlements of
Peniifylvania, however, as I am better ac
quainted in that quarter than in the other
tates j but my information enables me to
lifcern that the situation of thole settlements
las a great similarity to the situation of the
.veftern parts of many of the other (tate,
ind of aii the settlements on the Ohio.
In the western pares of Pennsylvania,
fchere the people are dole fettled, I had a
ew years ago the curiosity to number the
tills in particular neighbourhoods; and
ound, that, in some places, nearly half the
armers had either one (till or a pair of
tills (tÂ»he latter being the moil convenient
lumber) but in other places the poffeifion
)f frills was not near so common, efpecial
y among those citizens, who were far ad
vanced on the frontier, and had been fore
uced by the war, as to be unable to pro
-ure them. When the low price of land is
.oundered, a pair of (mall (tills, with the
oic. make a con/Iderable portion
>f a farmer's property ; and when the (tills
tre plenty, you will always observe, that
he plantations are better improved, and
lie appearance of indultry in general more
;oiifpicuous. But let mepaufefor amo
nent.
1 think I hear some folks asking, with fur
3rizc, are not these people great drunkards ?â
Sewfpaper scraps, indeed, have sometimes,
yith more vulgar rudenels, than mature informa
ion, ventured upon so gross an imputation ; â
md the sober, the ruminat ng Secretary, has
limielfmade a modest insinuation of the kind.
3ut I presume that the inference is drawn merely
rom the number of stills ; which is a ground of
:ftimation highly erroneous. Clearing new
ands, rolling*, raifmgs, &c. necefTarily require a
greater supply of spirits, than the labor of old
ettlcments. The heevy damps, and the great
er frequency of rams, in a country but newly
opened to the fun, encreafe the Occasion for fpi
lts. 1 appeal to the experience of the most
ibftemious men who have penetrated the woods
o survey lands, for the juflification of my re
nark. Those who keep stills are not often
irunkards; if they were, keeping them would
De a dangerous snare. lam confident that the
people in those countries are full as abstemious

drink their liquor (which is but of one kind) for
refrefhment in the day time, at iheir labor, or
when they meet with their friend ; while we
jfink it here, more prudently peihaps, in the

It is not to be denied, hewever, that there
are worthless, drunken fellow# in the distant
:ounties ; but are there not such here ? Yes:â
ind I believe th N proportion to be considerably
greater.
1 will now proceed to a more particular detaiL
3f the uses of this reprobated liquor. The far
mer who keeps stills s prepares spirits for his own
jfe, and pay* his tradesmen and laborers as far
is he can with it, and he likewise diftills grain
For the neighboring farmers, who keep no stills
rf their own ; and for which he receives grain
[>r a part of the spirits ; but he prefers money if
:hey can give it. Whisky is also (old to the ta~
/em-keepers, who do not very generally pay for
t, until long after itis drank. It afo is ufualty
bartered with the (lore keepers for goods,
which it will be readily elieved a high profit is
;harged, as the (lore-keepers themselves must
keep the spirits until it becomes scarce, which
is generally the cafe after harvest, and at wh'
ime they fell it to the tavern-keepers, or l Â°
people that are trading, or moving down thÂ®
iver. Those persons living near the Monon-
who make the spirits good and can keep it
3y them, have often a chance of felling it for
money, to those who are trading to the settle
ments down the Ohio, or to the Spanish settle
ments on the idiffifippi. In that cafe, if they8o not get the money immediately, they have
the promise of it when the trader returns ; winch
however has too often been diflolved bv the lois

the savages. In fucli settlements, 1 have o'b

like bank-notes, frequently funded on the credit
of whisky not vet exiiting. With these the far
mer will pay his blackftnith, and the blackftnith
will pay his taylor, &c. until at lass a number c
frr.all orders get condenled into 20 gallon loadi
of whisky. In the lettlemejns on the great ri

Two parties, fayc a correspondent, hav;
Ihe'wn themselves in the doings of the neM
government- One have evidently thoughi
favorably of a great public debtâwherec:
the other have viewed it as an evil, howe
ver necelTary a one<
So also, one party have considered specu
lation as the very foul of public credit, anc
as the mark of ufeful enterprise and thriving
wealth. The other, with a contrary eye
have viewed it as the pampered child of ar
unruly avarice, and the prolific parent o:
jdlenefs, diiHpation and fraud.
Further, it has been the endeavor of ont
party to work the public debt into an in
(trumen t for heaping up vast wealth in th(
hands of a few, so as by the subtle efficac;
Of married influence, to divide and rule thi
rrtany. Tiie other have stood up
this kind at'policy, as tanjuft and unrepub
lican, and a:; injurious to ail the belt inter
efts of the country.
Again, one pUrty have advocated the \vi
deft conluuclions of the constitution, so a:
to carry the powers of the government fai
beyond the obvious intent and inean:nÂ«
thereof, and therefore, beyond the gran!
of the pec,pie. The other have been" of t
different temper, and contended for a regu
lar observance of the constitution, equally
where it limits a-, where it grants powers,
and for cariying it into execution in a re
publican spirit and manner.
Time and events have decided the con
troversy between thele two sets of politici
ans ; and the public voice seems to be pro
nouncing the decision.
It appears thai a public debt is a public
evil every way, more cfpecially in such a
country and government like ours. All
parties now cry out for paying off the debt,
as the greuteft of public evils.
It appears that speculation, -tvhich in it:
ardor, filled the National Bank in one day,
and has been kept intoxicated by the spirit
of that institution, ever lince ; that specu
lation, which has dra'ned all the natural
channels of bufmefa, in order to swell the
mighty torrent in which it flowed j that
speculation which was born in extortion,
has been nursed in the arms of an ill-fated
policy, and exhibits the features of its ma
turity in baseness, in fraud and in ftyind
ling ; it appears that thisconfpicuous agent
in our affairs, in place of the industry,
wealth andlblid profperitv promised on one
fide, has produced all the extravagance,
prostitution of morals, and devastation of
the true sources of a flourifhing situation,
foretold on the other fide.
It appears, that the schemes for thowing
magnificent wealth into the undeserving
hands of a favorite few, and for undermi
ning the great republican barriers erected
by the constitution, have opened the eyes
:>f the people, and is calling forth the de
uionftrations of ti.eir general fanftion to th<
!â . i Ugcjesfliade by the friends of equal right,
jf cj;i titutiorial authority and republicar
lifHpu 'e-;
Thafe leafonable indications of the public
â nijJd are a liaopv proof of the force oi
ruth j".no"g a free people; and of tiie
i.vj, th'6'ugh flow interposition of its au
:!io'rity( io concrOul and correct an elective
government t'uftt doe:-, not conduct accord
ng to its true principles. This general in
ligmtiou against schemes that might b;.
legrefcs destroy the republican aonftitution
vhich binds up the people and ilales in one
;reat free system, must be the more pleas
ing to every friend of liberty and the union,
mafmuch as it {hews the fame desire in tbt
people every where to maintain both, and
:hat they ail adhere to the constitution as
:(lab!ilhed by themselves for that purpose,
vith defined powers and a republican form.

The following is an extract of a letterfrom London
dated January 20.
" The people of England, efperially the
Londoners, enthuliaftic as they are in the
idea of a certain independence, are not
withstanding the molt fluplcl admirers oi
ihefr court, when it affords any traits of
Iplendor gr magnificence to ft ast their.eyes
and feed their eurioiity. The 18th of this
nioutir was the day fixed to celebrate the
Queen's birth-day. Our public papers,
ever lubferviin: to the public taste, were
ft titled with accounts of the pompous and
Cplendid exhibitions which were to take
place on this brilliant day ; the drrfics that
were to be worn, the state-coach of the
prince of Wales, and the imnrenfe number
of diamonds with which this prince, the
queen, the princefies and the ladies of the
court were covered, from head to foot. â
Another circumftante, frtuchlefs agreeable,
j is idle burning of the Pantheon. This mag
nificent ed:fice, tiled for the purpose of
public ath'ufement, aitd whick had m::de
the fortune of many individuals has been
reduced to allies, on the nights of the 13th
and 14th of January,' only the external
walls being left, of the ivhole of that su
perb pile.âOn the f2th'inft. the melfenger,
r lint, was sent oft" to the court of Berlin
with dispatches, which are fa id to contain
the result of three cabinet co'r.fultations.
The alliance about to be eftabliflied be
tween the emperor and the states general
to' guarantee his sovereignty in the Belgic
provinces and the government eftabliflied
m the united provinces appears to be not so
weft relifrsed by aur court as by that of Ber
lin. The answer given thereto by the
states general, has prbved vague and dila
tory. Bclides this, our mirtiftry seem' not
to be disposed to consent to the reftritlions
which the court of Vienna, in its ratifica
tion, had impofe'd upon the convention at
tile Hague. In the mean time, no power
finds itielf so much at leilure as England,
to improve its financial concern:, ; and
great things are expected on this score at
the opening of the next session of parlia

News from the WeJi.lnd.ics,
Since our lait, several vefTels have arrived
here from Port-au-Price ; all of which bring the
mod gloomy account, of tile fnuation pfÂ°that
illand ; the diflrefles of which appear to be ow
ing, not more 10 the revolt arid devaflatioh of
the Haves than to the enmity prevailing among
the treemen, and the want of fubordniati'on to
any government.
About the 13th of March, the negroes at
tacked the town <>1 Leogaue, let fire to the plan
tations on the plain, and were joined by the ne
groeiJ thereon, who had till then been in quiet
fcrvitude : after much fighting and burning, the
negroes retreated. Many were killed onÂ°both
fidesâthe lowcft number, including all parties
and colours is dated at ioco.
Capt. Wollman of Salem, who failed from
Port-au-Prince the 23d of March, at evening,
informs, that 1000 militia and 500 regulars
marched cut that morning, said to be on'ac
count of the iiifmrection of the negroes on seve
ral plantations on the .plain, who had drove
their mailers into town. âThat they were met
and opposed by the mulattoes, whose head quar
j ters were only 4 nnles from the town. âThat
he saw numbers of wounded biought into town
| while he was on shore.âThat the battle conti
nued all dayâand that its issue vas unknown
. when he failed.
A detachment of the regular troops had been
called for, by the municipality, to go to Leo -
I gane, at the time of the negroes attacking that
place, and boats Were prepared to tratifport
i them ; but the oil ice is refufed to etnba' kâas they
laid their orders were to defend the town of Port

their quitting their flatten. For the lame reason,
they have alio refufed to march to the plains a
round Port-au-Prince. But the clamours of the
populace, and of the private foldiei s, bring for
aflion, the Municipality caused the officers to be
arrefled, and sent to the Cape, in ordtr to be
