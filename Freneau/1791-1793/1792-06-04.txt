Sec.3. T SHALL endeavour to prove
X upon the principles of induc
tive reasoning, that the ejfetls relulting
from the combined operations of the
causes of the second feÂ£lion, arc the caul
es which produce thole fevers fpecified
above.âlt is a position I believe in me
dicine univerfaliy granted, that the liv
ing existence is supported by the con
stant operation of certain causes adting
on a certain principle of life inherent in
animals.*âlt is alio granted that the
human body is continually tending to
putrefa&ionf ; it ;s consequently always
undergoing a change, and in the course
(if seven years, according to Mr. Locke,
the, human body fullers a total changej.
I conceive that these different {fates
tnay be influenced materially by a total
or partial privation, or by an excellive
application of caules, for it is proved
(from facts indisputable) that the living
principle may soon be cxhaufted, by the
constant application of excelfive llimu
]i ; and alio, that life may be prolonged
by theadminiflration of the proper kinds
of stimuli.
Hence it seems that this principle of
life inherent in animals, (called by Dr.
Brown the excitability) is the fulcrum
upon which the beam of health turns, and
from a flrifl observance of the weight at
the end of the lever, we might ascertain
to a mathematical exa&ncfs, on which
fide the deficiency lies ; therefore the
avenue to the clear perception of truth,
appears to be opened, and the aid of the
fk.ilful physician might with undoubted
certaintv soon reflore the equilibrium
of health.
It has been cbferved in the Jirjl feClion,
that twenty-seven parts of dephlogiftica
ted and Jeventy-three parts of mephitic
air, compose the atmosphere. Itihould
have been added, when the mercury in
the thermometer stands at 63 it would
constitute a natural healthy atmosphere,
wh:n uninfluenced by aay hurtful pow
ers âbut as the accumulation ot the
matter of fire raises the mercury in the
thermometer, above that healthy tempe
rature just fpecified, the air is propor
tionally rarefied, consequently the ex
ceffiveheat flimulatesthe human fyflem,
directly in that ratio to its degree, and
produces a kind of indirect debility, in
the latitude 40 N. fitnilar to that debili
ty produced by excessive fatigue, but in
certain situations nearer the equator,
the confcquences refuhing from the ac
cumulation of the rays of heat from the
Sun, appear to be greater.
Dr. Lind observes, in " Port Maho,
near the island <sf Rathian, fhipsliein
a bason of water so environed with high
mountains, that the wind can have no
access to them. The flagnant air thence
becomes so unwholefome,that men after
being there a few days, are suddenly
seized with violent vomitings, head
achs, delirium, &c. and in two or three
days more the dissolved mass of blood
issues from every " Doflors
Macbride, Boifien, and Pearfon, con
clude,that a light atmosphere will hasten
putrefaction, and a heavy one will retard
it; from this they conclude that put re
faflion is more rapid in large cities than
in the country||" From these fails and
observations, we should, I prcfume, be
juflifiable in inferring, that heat when
applied to the human body (in propor
tion to its degree above 63) produces

"ometimes a kind of indirect debility dif
ferent from that indirect debility which
constitutes aftital difeafc, and sometimes
produces actual disease from its excef
live indirect effects different from that
indirect debility which may be restored
:>y the (alutary effects of profound sleep.
' In thole situations on the globe men
tioned above, where the balance of the
atmosphere is aeftroyed, either from the
accumulation of the matter of fire alone,
or from the circumstances attendant
thereon, mentioned in the second head of
Sell. 2, it renders the air inefficient from
its directly debilitating effects, to sup
port animal health||, and lively combul
tion, &C.H which a natural atmosphere
would produce; hence, this destruc
tion of the dephlogifticated principle of
the atmosphere, acting as a directly de
ailitating power, on the indirect debility
already efiablifhed in the animal fibre,
in consequence of the excessive stimula
ting power of heat : These causes acting
in conjunction with the debilitating
power of moisture, constitute a kind of
debility, denominated by Dr. Brown a
mixed debility, and which I conceive,
lays the foundation of bilious and re
mittent fevers.
Moisture is water in a state of vapour
diffufed through the atmosphere. It
serves as a great condi:ftor of heat and
of electricity,and supports these substan
ces equally diffuled. Hence we fee
those people who inhabit the foggy si
tuations, complain much of chilliness,
of languor.and of debility ; unfortunate
ly this moisture is not a direst conse
quence of the accumulation of the ca
loric principle or matter of fire in the
atmosphere, but an indireftconfequence,
(owing to certain circumstances) other
wise it would in some aieafure counter
act the debilitating effects of heat, by
partially converting it into a latent or
quiescent state. That moisture is a
great conductor of heat, and of courlc a
directly debilitating power, has been
clearly proved by experiments in the
Torricellian Vacuum*.
Also that a moist atmosphere serves
asacondufting medium for electricity is
proved by facts indifputable,forindamp,
moist weather, the electrician is generally
baffled in attempting to collect the eled
tric fluid+ : it is alio observed by phi
losophers, that in those moist regions of
the earth, at the time of the existing
foggs, there is very little lightning and
thunder, supposing it serves as a medi
um through which the electric matter
passes from the earth to the atmosphere,
and vice verja.
May not moisture fervc as a powei
to convert partially the matter of fire
derived from the Sun into a latent state,
thereby depriving it of its necelfary sti
mulus, to excite into action the diffufed
electric fluid J, which electric fluid, when
concentrated, might restore in some de
gree the balance of the atmosphere, by
converting the different airs into new
substances, as nitrous acid, vol. alkali.
&c. and thereby obviating in an emi
nent degree, those diseases which af
flict the inhabitantsin the different situ
ations fpecified above.
May not moijlure prove the cause ol
those fevers in another way, independ
ent of its being a conductor of heat and
of electricity ? For as inflammable aii
is generated under the circumstance;
mentioned in Sect. 11, and from its great
levity ascends in the day time together
with the insensible exhalation from the
earth, but when the rays of the Sun are
subducted, this insensible exhalation is
condensed into dews ar.d fogs, and
from its fpecific gravity in those new

forms, it descends and repels before it,
down to the furface of the earth, the
great volume of inflammable air ; for
it is inconteftibly proved bv tlx experi
ments of Richard Kirwan, F. R. S. that
water and inflammable air will not unite
even by Hence this may
perhaps relblvc many phenomena at
tending the evening air in different cli
mates and the rcafon why it is more
pernicious to health than the morning
air.
When the temperature of the air sud
denly changes from many degrees above
to many below 63 degrees of Farenheit's
thermometer, it may then I conceive
prove an exciting cause of thole diicaf
es. if indirect debility is already efla
blifhed in the animal fibre ; but it there
is only a predisposition to indirect debi
lity, it will prove a remedy in reducing
the excessive excitement, and restore
the body to its healthy point ; if the
cold increases gradually it changes the
type of those fevers : I therefore pre
sume that cold is not generally, but may
at times prove an accidental cause, for
it is very seldom in this latitude, that
the temperature of the evening air, at
the season of the year in which these epi
demics prevail, is below 63 degrees.
If these facts and observations which
I have adduced should fufficiently efta
alifh firm and just premises, and if
the reasons that 1 have offered be com
pletely indu&ive of thejuftnefs of their
eonfequcnces, they will I presume fatis
factorily explain the causes of the bilious
and remittent fevers, for " no more cau
ses of natural things ought to be admit
ted than are true and lufficient to ex
p'ain the phenomena." How then can
we admit into the causes of the bilious
and remittent fevets, the celebrated marjh
miasma, a iubftance fiti generis, a sub
stance that has never been proved ana
lytically or synthetically to exist. This
miasma is supposed by some to be animal
cula or organic bodies, by others, inor
ganic or corpuscular fubltances. Let
us then survey with oneglance this fub
jeft ana the arguments which have been
adduced and place to our imagination
those causes on a f nailer scale ; for exam
ple, placc a vegetable in a finall velfel
fubjeft to all the causes and circumflan
ces above enumerated : let us then ana
lyle the atmosphere that surrounds this
lubfcance, after fermentation, and the
new produced matter resulting from
fermentation, and comparatively eiti
mate them with those consequences
flowing from like causes and like circum
stances on the larger scale, and fee in
what degree the results differ.
From our knowledge of the compo
nent parts of the atmosphere, and of the
properties of vegetable matter ; from
our complete knowledge of the effetts
of heat and of moisture on those sub
stances and the effetls flowing there
from, I amjullified, I presume, in deny
ing (but with all deference due to the
opinions of the great fathers of physic)
the exigence of marfli miafma âIf marjh
miasma is not to be found here where
shall it be fought for P Is it to be found
in the imagination of its votaries ?
Let me recommend with submission
to the Dogmatists in this doftiine to
publish amanifefto and then resign.

Francis ill, king of Hungsry, and succes

gives but finall hopes of long lite, being
fnbjeft to a debility of constitution which
renders it improper for him to make any

In such circumstances little is to be expec

The misunderstandings between the
Dutch colony at the Cape of Good-Hope
and the mother country are becoming worse
than ever. âThe Causes of complaint
on the part of the colony are, the recal of
thepopular governor, Vangrave ; the trans
ferring the garrison to the defence of some
of the Aliatic poflelfions of the States; and
the declared intention of the Stadtholder's
Court to fend commissioners to examine
and punifii those who have been active in
promoting dill'entioiis. âThey have de
manded that taxes Humid be discretionary,
and all pecuniary aids such as they fiiall

be the cafe, the diltiljation of grain and
fruits increasing prodigiously in America.
Should the Britilh government refufe to
admit any longer the tiour and corn of the
United Slates into their illands, as is pro
poled, America can ealily do herfelf juitice
by encouraging lief own home dHtilleries,
and importing no more foreign spirits. Great
Britain, which does not produce a super
abundance of grain for ner own and her
W.lndia colonies' use, nevertheless brews
up and diftills J4 millions of bulliel:', yeariy;
so that it is not likely the Americans will
throw away their surplus of grain rather
than diftilit into liquors."
WE the fubferibers, weavers of the
city of Philadelphia, attended this
clay, Tliurfday May 24th, at Mr. Pearce's
cotton manufactory No. 13 Penn street, to
view his machinery ; moll of us are Eu
ropeans, and do all agree, that his abilities
in mechanism are superior to any we ever
saw, especially in his double loom, in which
une man can weave two pieces at the fame
time, 42 Inches wide, with equal facility
to one piece in the common loom; this
ufefullooni when examined appears limple,
the art of working it soon attained, and
the extra expence very small ; his machines
for carding and roping are excellent,, and
all the reflof the utenlils prepar'd for the
buflnefs are contriv'd with ;'/eat judgment,
the whele of which we liope will soon
come into general use, and be found of great
ut'd.ty in tne United States.

"Inthe Constitution of Pennsylvania, as
well as in the federal conflitution of theU.
States, there is no such thing as the idea of
a coinpaft between the people on one fide,
and the government on the other. The
compact was that of the people with each
other, to produce and constitute a govern
ment. To suppose that any government
can be a party in a compart with the whole
people, is to suppose it to have existence
before it can have a right to exilt. The only
inftancein which a compact can take place
between the people and those who exercise
the government, is, that the people shall
pay them, wh.lethey chufe to employ them.
Government is not a trade which any man
or body of men have a right to set up and
. 'Lercife for their own emolument ; but is
altogether a trufl, in right of those by whom
that trull is delegated, and by whom it is
always refumeable. It ha?, of itfelf, 110

BOSTON, May 24.
The innumerable paragraph? in the papers,
relative to the horrid devaftatioilS, and
massacres connnited 011 our frontiers, are
iuft calculated to puff up the Indian war-
If the accounts be true, so far from being
pleaded as apologies for prosecuting the war,
they should rather lead to an enquiry, how
it coiiies that .he tribe:, of Indians
who for so many years before were peace
ible and quiet, are now in such violent com
motion-
To judge of this Indian buHnefs, we'
'hould not consider it in ts prejentflage, but
:arry our researches ifc irortii 1,. & en
quire by whose advice, and by whose influence
we are now involved in this expeniive, dis
graceful ruinous war. After this is
done let the man or men be arraigned to
aafwer for the consequences.
The Britilh papers were formerly crowd
ed with the accounts of riots,&c. (as they
were then called) of the patriots of this
country, in order to excite the resentment
of that nation ; but the whigs in England,
were aware of the delign, and instead of
urging the mar, were tor changing measures,
and bringing Bute, North, (Sc. to answer for
their conduit. Instead of calling for troops
to ravage America, impeachments were the cry
to purge the ministry.
The additional burden thrown on our
Commerce ought to be fatisfaflorily ac
counted for. It may be sport tofome indivi
duals, whose importance would be annihi
lated, should the war fubiide, but it is ruin
to the great body of the people. It was ex
pelled, that the late longfeffion, woulci have
produced a decrcafe of dut.e , rather than an
augmentation ; and it is probable this would
have been the cafe, had not the Indian war
blalted the attempt.
The exorbitant salaries granted to the
multitude of Federal Officers, together with
the expenditures to carry on the Indian
war, are heavy weights thrown 011 our
Commerce- if excellive salaries are requi
site, ami the honor of the states is involved
;iithe Indian war, why (hould not some
part of the revenue arile from " additional"
Tonnage on foreign bottoms ? Why fhouid
the carrying trade be totally neglefted,while
the industrious American merchant has the
mortification to find himfell deprived of his
freight by foreigners, and a. the fame time
hamper'd in his trade by heavy additional
duties. It muftbe allowed by every rea
lonable man that Commerce has alrea
dy its full proportion of the weight of the
[fovernment; some other source is there
fore requisite, as we may drain this bufmefs
beyond its bearings. Foreign Tonnage is
1 proper object of revenue ard it woiud o
perate in a two fold ratio in our favour ;
it would raise a vast revenue, and at the
fame time would give encouragement and
value to our own navigation.
