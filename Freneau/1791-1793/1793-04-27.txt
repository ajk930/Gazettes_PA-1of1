IRELAND is at present a great objcÂ£i
upon the political theatre of the world ;
ami every tlrp ihe takes towards her email
cipation mu'.tbe highly intere,ling, & parti
cularly so to Americans. Such ol their pa
pers as are not under the baneful influence,
or fear of the court, speak in every page
that bold anil glowing language of Liberty,
which upon greatoccafions Ihe neverfailstc
inlpire. From an immense number oi pi o
ductions of this fort, the following is fe
lefted as part of the entertainment of this
day's paper.
THE SOCIETY OF
UNITED IRISHMEN,
AT DUBLIN,
TO THE
VOLUNTEERS OF IRELAND,
William Drennan, Chairman., Arch- Ham.
Ro-wan, Secretary.
Citizen Soldiers,
YOU firft took up arms to protest your
country from foreign enemies, and
from donu llic difturbaace. For the fame
purposes.it now becomes neceflary th-u
you iiiould resume them. A proclamation
has been issued in England for embodying
the militia, and a proclamat on has been
issued by the lord lieutenant and council
in Ireland, fÂ»r repi*efling; all seditious allo
cation.â  In confeque ice of both these
proclamations, it is realonab e to appre
hend danger from abroad, and danger at
home. For whence but from apprehend
ed dinger are thole menacing preparations
for war drawn through the ltreet <â¢Â» this
capital, or whence, it not to create that
internal commbtion which was not found,
to Hi ike that credit whuh was not afetted.
to blalt the volunteer honour wh.ch was
hitherto inviolate* are thole terrible fug
gettiuas and ru nours and whispers, that
lfleet at evtfry corner, agitate leaf!
our old men, our women and children.
Whatever be the motive, or from whate
ver quarter it arises, alarm hasrifen ; and
you, VOLUNTEERS OF IRELAND, are
tnerefore Summoned to arms at the in
stance of government, as well as by the
refponlibility attached to your character.
and the permanent obligations of your in
f.itution We will not, at this day, cori
del'cend to quote authorities for the right
of having and of uling arm.-. ; but we wi.
cry aloud, even amidit the liorm raited b>
the witchcraft of a proelamatio i, that tc
your formation was owing the peace anc
protection of this ifl nd, to your relaxation
has been owing its relapl'e into impotence
and i ilignifi. ance, to your renovation mud
be owing its future freedom and it
present tra iquil ty. You are th resort
l'liinnioned to arm-, iji oder to prcferve
your country in that"guard(d quiet, whicl
may f.cure it from external h iltility. anc
to maintain that internal regimen through
out the land, which superseding a notori
o.is police, or a ufpefled militia, mly pre
serve the blessings of peace by a vigilani
preparation for war.
Citizen foidiers, to arms ! Take up tin
fhiekl ot freedom, and the pledges of peace;
âPeace, the motive and end ol your vir
tuous ialtitution. War, an occalional du
ty, ought never to be made an occupation

f others. The facrifice of life, in the
Service of our country, is a duty much toe
honourable to be intruded to mercenaries,
and at tni's time, when your country has
by punlic authority been declared in dan
ger, we conjure you by your interelt, youi
duty and your glory, to to your arms,
and in spite of police, in spite of a fenci
ble militia, in virtue of two proclamations,
to maintain goo.l order in your vicinage,
and tranquility in Irelafld. It is only bj
the military array of men in whom they
confide, whom they have been accuflom
ed to revere as the guardians of domellic
peace, the protestors of their liberties and
lives, that the present agitation of the peo
ple can be stilled, that tumult and licenti
ous less can be repressed, obedience secur

diffuftd through the public mind, in the
speedy refurrettion ol a free constitution ;

we use tor an opportunity of repelling ca

Bv liberty we never understood unlimit

of property, or the deltruction of fubonli

updiftrult and division, wiflies to continue
tne proud arbitrators of* the fortunes and
fate of Ireland. Liberty is the exercise of
ail our rights natural and political, secur

iett dimensions of the constitution, of the

lective will, and that legislation may origi
nate from public reason, keep pace with

iic happiness. If our com.itution be im
perfect, nothing but a reform in represen
tation will rectify it> abuies ; it it be per
se&, nothin. but the facie reform will per
petuate its bleflings.
We now addrn you as citizens, for to
je citizens you became so diers ; nor can
we help wishing that all fuldiers, partaking
:he and interelt of the people,
vvouid remember that they were once ci

irit to move, and then to raise the world.
We, therefore, wish for Catholic emaiui

nent as mereiy the port .1 to the temple oJ
lat.onal freedom ; wide as this entrance
a âwide enough to admit three million-,

jrinciple, which takes 111 every individual

ion ; but were it obtained to-morrow,
o-morrow would we go on, as vv do to
lay. in the pursuit of the reform which
a ouid 11 ill be wanting to ratify their liber
lies as well as our own.
For both these purposes it appears necef
*ary that provincial conventions fhouid as
emb-e preparatory to a convention of the
ProteUant people. The delegates of the
:atholic body are not jultified in commu
nicating with individuals, or even bodies
if inferior authority, and therefore an as
embly of a similar nature and organiza
[ion is necelfary to eflablifh an intercourfc
?f fentimeit, an uniformity ot conduct, an
united caufe,and a united nation. If a con
mention on the one part does not foorr fol
low, and is not soon connected with ti.a.
on the other, the common cause w ill fplil
into the party a I i itereft, the people w iii 1 e
lax into inattention and inertnessâthe
union of affection and exertion w ill dif
solve, and too probably some local i..fui"
region, instigated by the malignity of our
:ommon enemy, may commit the charac
ter, and risque the tranquility of the lfl. nd,
which can be obviated only by the influence
if an afleinbly arising from, assimilated
with the people, and whose spirit may be
as it were knit with the foul of tne nation.
Unless the sense of the protellant people
be, on their part, as fairly collected and
as juditioufly direaed, unless individual
exert 011 consolidates into collective
strength. unless the particles unite into a
mass, we may perhaps serve some person,
or some party lor a little, but the public
not at all. The nation is neither insolent,
nor rebellious, nor feditiou^; while it
knows its rights, it is unwilling to manifefi
its powers ; it would rather supplicate ad
mi nift rati on to anticipate revolution by a
w ell timed reform, and to save their coun
try in mercy to themselves.

That, with the deeped concern, we now
ind ourftlves obliged to relinqtiilh tha
lope, without any evidence having bee:
produced to latisiy 11s that his majesty'
ninilfers have made such efforts as it wa

laving contributed, in a great measure, to
jroducethe pi tfenl rupture.
Various grounds of hostility againf
France have been dated, but none thatap
jeared to us to have condituted such a:
urgent and imperious cafe of necefiity a
eft no room for accommodation, and inad(
war unavoidable. âThe government o;
France has been accused of having violatec
thelawcf nations, and the deputations o
exiding treaties, by an attempt to deprive
the republic of the united provinces of thÂ«
cxclulive navigation of the Schilck. Isc
evidence, however, has been offered u
convince u- that this exclusive navigatior
was, either in itfel. or in the estimation o:
those who were alone intereded in pre
ferring it, of such importance as to judify
a determination in our government to
break with France on that account ; it, in
(ast, the dates general had Ihewn a dispo
sition to defend their right by force cf
arms, it might have been indance of the
trued frier.dfhip to have f'jÂ£geded.to them,
[Total No. i 56.]
(or their serious consideration, How far the
aijertion of tliis unprofitable claim might,
in the prtfent circumstances of Furope,
tend to bring into hazard the moll elfen
tial interells of the republic.âBut when,
on the contrary, it ha- been acknowledged
that no requisition on tliis fubjecl \\ as madÂ£
to his m jrfty, on the part of the Hates
general, we a:e at a loss to comprehend otl
what grounds of right or propriety we
take the lead in aflVrtmg a claim m which
we are not principals, and in which thS
principal party lias not, as far as we kltlow'j
though; it prudent or to call for
our interposition.
We muil further rem rk that the | o:nt
in di pure seemed to u to have been re
lieved from a material part of its difficulty,
by the declaration of the h inn er pt fo
reign aif iirs in France, that tne French na
tion gave up all pretentions to deter
mine the question of the future navigation
of the Scheldt. Whether the terms oj this
declaration were perfeiily fati. factory or
not, they at leiril left the qneftion open to
pacific negotiation ; in which the intrinftc
value of the object, to ai y of the parties
concerned in it, might have been coolly and
impartially weighed against tht conicquen
ces.to which any of them might be exposed
by attempting to maintain it by force of
arms.
We have been called upon to resist views
of conquest and aggrandizement entertain
ed by the government of France, " at ail
" times dangerous to the general intereflt
"of Furope, but" aliened 10 be - ' ptcnli
'â  arly so, when connected with the propa
" gution of principles, which lead to ihe
" violation of the 1110 ft sacred duties, and
" are utterly subversive of the peace and
" order of" all civil society."
We admit, that it is the interest and du
ty of every member of the commonwealth

ind dillribution of power among the inde
pendent sovereignties, which actually lub
llt, and to pre'vnt the aggrandizement of
myflate, efpeeially the moll powerful, at
heexpcnie of any other ; and, for the
lonour of his majesty s councils, we do
ndlt earntftly wilh, that his n.iniflers had
iiianifeltcd a juli fenl'e of the inportai.ee
>f the principle to which they i ow appeal,
n thecourfeof late events, which seemed
:o us to threaten its entire dtlhuiiion.
W hen Polx.d was beginning toiecover

ind unprincipled invasion ; het territory
â¢verrun, her free couftitution subverted,
ier national independence annihilated,
md the general principles of the security
if nations wounded through her fieie.
With all these evils was France scon after
hrea'teticd, and with the fame appear nee
?ither of lupine indifference, or of let ret
ipprobation, his majefly's ministers hehelcl
h.' armies of other powers (in evident

' barbarism in war, which a beiufic< nÂ£

â¢' true military honour, have for a long
â¢ time banished from the cfnlltlan world.'
No effort appears to have been n . < e to
heck the prog reft of tin fe invading ar
nies;âhis nnjefty'sminifters, a dtrap e
nded refpeft lor the rights art) rdf p< li
cence of other fove.eigns. thought h at

of his majefly's councils at d gocd i fl ces,

o a foreign power. But no fo> nt r. by an
fver mttnoi able reverse ol t iluiie. had
b rame repulsed her invader and carried
her arms into their territory, than hi; ma
jesty's minilters. laying ailde the codufive
indifference which had marked the.r con
duel during the invasion of Frame, be fan
to expre'fi alarms for the general security
of Europe, which. a< it appears to us. thejr
ought to haveferioufly feb, and n mht'fiave
exprefied. with gre; ter jnflice, on'the pre
vious fucctflts of her powerful adverfa#
ries.
We will not dlflVir.ble our opinion, th.'.S
the decree Â»t' ti-e national convention ofFrance of the 19th of November, 1792, was
in a great measure liable to the objections
urged againlt it; but we can. 10: admit tlu t
a war, upon the iingle ground oj such a de
cree, unaccompanied by any overt aCts, by
â¢which we or our allies nngtit be directly
attacked,would be jultiiied as neceifary.aiHl
unavoidable. Certainly not âunlcfs, upoi:
a regular demand made by his majesty's
miniiters of explanation and feenrity in be
half ot us and our allies, the French had re
luted to give his majeity such explanation
and security. No fuc!i demand was made.
Explanations, it is true, have been receivec
and rejected. But it well deserves to bt
remarked and remembered, that tnefe ex
planations were voluntarily offered on the
part ot France, not previously demandec
on ours, as undoubtedly they would have
been, if it had suited the views of his ma
jelty's ininilters to have acted frankly and
honourably towards France, and dol tc
have reserved their complants for a future
period, when explanations, however rea
sonable, might come too late, and hoitilities
might be unavoidable.
After a review of all those considerations,
we think it neceli'ary to represent to his
majeity, that none ot the points which were
in dispute between his miniiters and the go
vernment of France, appear to us to have
been incapable of being adjulted by negoti
ation, except that aggravation of French
ambition, wnich has been stated to arift
from the political opinions of the Frencl
nation. 1 tiefe indeed, we conceive,form
ed neither any delirable object of negotia
tion, nor any intelligible reason for holtili
ly 1 hey were equally incapable of
adjulted by treaty, or of being either res ut
ed or confirmed by the events of war.
We need not state to his majesty's v\ if
dom, that iorce can never cure delusion
and we know his majelty's goodness toe
Well to suppose, that he could ever enter
tain the idea of employing force to deProj
opinions by the extirpation of those whe
hold them.
The grounds, upon which his majefty'i
miniiters have advii'ecf him to refufe the re
newal of (bine avowed public intercourse
with the existing government of France,
appeared to us neiiher juftifnd by the rea
son of the thing itfelf, nor by the usage oi
nations, nor by any expediency arifingfroir
the present state of circumstances. In al
negotiations or difcullions whatsoever, ol
which peace is the real objeCt, the appear
ance ot an amicable disposition, and of 2
re idiiiefs to offer and accept of pacifi: ex
planations on both fides, is as necessary and
ufeful to enfnre success, as any arguments
founded 011 striCt right. Nor can it be de
nied, that claims or arguments of any kind,
urg.d in hollile or haughty langu igb, hou -
ever equitable or valid in themselves, art
more likely to provoke than to conciliate
the oppolite party. Deploring, as we have
ever done, the melancholy event which lla
lately Happened in France, it would yei
have been some -consolation to us to have
h.ard, that the powerful interpolit'on ol
the Britilh nation on this subjeCt, had at
lead been offered, although it lhÂ»uld unfor
tunately have been rejected. But, instead
of receiving such consolation from the con
duit of his majesty's miniiters, wehavefeen
them with extreme altonifhment employ
ing, as an incentive to hoitilities, ail event,
which they had made no effort to aveit by
negotiation. This inaction they could on
ly excuse on the principle, that the inter
nal conduct of nations (whatever may be
our opinion of its morality) was no proper
ground tor interpolition and remonltrance
from foreign Matesâa principle, from which
it mult ftil 1 more clearly follow, that such
internal conduit could never be an adm f
fible, juility ng reason for war.
We cannot refrain from ohferving, that
such frequent allulions as have been made
to an event (confefledly no ground of rup
ture) feemeel to us to have arisen from a
finflter intention to derive, from the hu
manity of : nglilhinen,popularity for mea
sures, which tneir deliberate judgment
would have reprob ited. and to influence
the molt virtuous sensibilities of his majes
ty's people, into a blind and furious zeal for
a war of vengeance.
His majesty's faithful Commons therefore,
though always determined to ffipport hi
luajelty with vigour and cordiality in the
exertions necefi'ary for the defence of hi
kingdoms, yet feel that they are equally
bounel bv their duty to his majesty. and t<>
theÂ»pfellow-fubjects,todeclare,in the moll
solemn manner, their difappvo'jation of the
conduCt of his majelty's ministers, through
out the whole of these transactions ; a con
duct, which in their opinion could lead to
no other termination, but that, to which it
seems to have been (tudioufly directed, ot
plunging thfcir country into an unnecessary
war. The calamities of such a war mult
be aggravated, in the estimation of every
rational mind, by reflecting on the peculiar
advantages of that fortunate lituatioti,
which we have so unwisely abandoned, and
which not o.ily exempted 11s from lharing
in the diflreffes arid affliaions of the other
nations of Europe, but converted them into
sources of benefit, improvement, and pros
perity to this country.
We therefore humbly implore his majes
ty's paternal goodness to listen no longer to
the councils, which have forced us into this
unhappy war, but to embrace the earliest
occasion, which his wisdom may discern,'
of reltoring to his people the bieiiings of I
peace.
FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE.
Official account of the takh.g of Breda by
the French, oti the 23d of ietruary.
La(t Saturday, the 23d instant, about
half after eight o'clock, a trumpeter, ac
companied by a French officer, arrived be
fore the gates of Bosch, and were conduc
ted to the commandant, whom they sum
moned in the name of General Dttmou
rier, to surrender this city. The com
mandant sent an answer about 12 o'clock,
implying a refufal; ttoflilities commenced
about hull alter 3 o'clock ; the French
threw some and howitzers into the
city : the firft was so well directed, that it
tell before the guard house, and wounded
a grenadier. By the subsequent bombs fe
deral houses were damaged; the alarm
was immediately be:it, and the militarj
took their respective stations. From th it
time the bombardment became very vio
lent, and uninterruptedly till fevei
o'clock at night, when all was still for
Come time.
On Sunday morning, about half after
three o'clock, the French bombardment
became extremely violent, and was weli
answered by thegarrifon. It lasted till se
ven o'clock, and during that time the
French threw in 150 bombs and howit
zers, which demoiifhcd more than lixty
houses.
The damage might still have become
greater,&couldnot poffiblybe repaired,(ince
no person durst appear in the llreets to
catch the bombs and extinguilh the fire,
and every inhabitant fought refuge' in the
cellar ps his house.
On Sunday towards noon, another ftaff
officer with a trumpeter, arrived before
the gate of Bosch, and was again conduc
ted to the commandant, to furpmon the
city again, threatening to reduce the place
to aihes, and to put the whole garrison -to
the sword. After this, the firft council oi
war was held, and towards night a â¢ Major
with a trumpeter were dispatched ito the
French General, who remained with the
trench all night and did not return till
MoncTay mormrtg, when we heard that the
capitulation was made.
We u ere then informed, that the garri
lon I hold d march out with all the honours
of w ai, each battalion with two field pie
ces, to Bosch, I hiel, Bommel, and
Utrecht, with perfeif liberty to remain in
the lervice of tiieltale, and to pgainil
any enemy.
In virtue of this capitulation, this after
noon about four o'clock the battalion 01
Orange-Naflau, with a part of that of
Dam, marched, drums beating, colours
flying, and two field pieces, through the
fates oi Boftjhi
At three o'clock about 450 men, infan
cy and Cuirallicrs, entered this place from
the French camp.
Fortunately few lives have been loft:.
One burgher was killed by a bomb, and an
apothecary's wife dangerously wounded.
Thegarrifon have not loft a lingle man.
What number the French have loft we
cannot tell.
Stockholm, Feb. I.âA war between
this country and Russia has been deemed
probable ; it now appears inevitable.
Advice was this day received, that a
Rullian army 0f'24,000 men had been for
med on the frontiers of Swedilh Finland.
The ace tint has occasioned great alarm,
and Count Cederllrom, the new adjutant
general, has received orders to march to
rhe frontiers, and with Inch forces as he
may be able to aflemble, to oppose the
Ruffians should they attempt an invasion.
This city is in a (fate of the utmolt fer
mentation.
Troops are daily arriving in this capital;
ind the duke regent has issued a procfa
nation, Hating for reason of these extra

Fellow Soldiers,
tT has been, and I am, fearful still is, the
* difpolition of all governments to con
'pire against the people: they appear to
â  orni separate interests, iind the many are
-Jwaysthe objects of pre;y to th efsw. This
disposition produces a sympathy among
governments, and whenever power is the
uiijett, arid there is no jarring ot other in
terelts to oppo e it, they are always ready
to afford each other aid. It is this which
nas produced the cimibi ation of govern -
mints againll the people of France. In
the infancy of governments, when the voice
of the people is conlidercd as the voice or
God, the people have their full (hare oi
conlideration, because they are then the
power oi' the nation ; but in proportion a
manhood approaches, a:.d governors
their authority with the vigor
of the government, the peopie are viewed
at secondary beings in the scale of thing
The example of 1" ranee has llrutk terror
intoa\\governments, &: itappearsasif ours
wasfeized with the panic, and was difpo
led to exercise the governmental sympathy
which European nations feeni to teel. Io
reason a priori upon the fubjeÂ£t, we should
be led to conclude that men who ityled
themselves republicans wouldfeel foreach
other ; but if we recur to experience, and
the immediate facts before us we lhall dis
cover that a republican government is
lending its sympathetic feelings to manar
chy. By a treaty formed between France
and the United States in the hour of adver
sity, we guaranteed certain things to f ranee
if Hie u ould lend us her afhlfance ; Hie has
been faithful to her contrast, while we
leem to be flirinking from our faith, 'lis
true that we Yormed this treaty with the
monarchy ot France, and it will no doubt
be explained ..way by every friend to that
Ipecies of government. But 1 will alii,
what were our objects when we applied to
France for relief? Torender our/elves free.
What .s the prt sent objeil of tne Frencli
nation -?âto render her/elf free. 'Ought
not then the analogy of our circumstances,

It we are republicans in substance and
not in lhadow tne aauver will be very ea

France isfo great tuat meal'wres have been
[ â¢.ken by so .ie of the f officers of our gov
ernment; to prevent a joyful reception o!
cue French amballador The reason al
ledged for this .s uifulting to freemenâ
it cannot be blotted from the memory ol
mir citizens that the present aiub.-iliadpr
was received with the ringing of bells ;
but as he was the ambalfador of n monarch,
i:id Mr. Genet is the ambalfador of a re
public he is to be received with less ref
jcÂ£t. Is this difpolition friendly to uur re
public a! allies ?
Men are fond of precedent when it cor
responds with their views : but admitting
tiiere is no precedent for the tiring of can
non &c. (and I b. lieee there is) on the ar
rival of the ambaflador of France, ought
this to prevent it ? As republicanswe ought
to evidence oar attachment to republican
ism by the molt refpettful reception of the
representative of the people ot France.
Was there a precedent for the tiring ot

PHILADELPHIA.
Saturday, April 27-
A pilot arrived here yellerday from
Delaware Capes, bringing intelligence tli
the French frigate L'hmbulcade wn> oil
mdhjd taken the lhip Grange, outward
bound from this port to Liverpool, and
the brig Little Sarah, for Jamaica, which,
he added, were both on their return to
town, accompanied by the frigate. It
was also said by the pilot,that from the ac
counts he had received, the frigate had
captured in all seven vessels on the Ameri
can coafl, 4 sent to Charlelton, one to
New York, and two to this poTt.
L'Embufcade, and her two prizes, were
expe&ed up last evening, but it being ebb
tide and the wind N. E. none of them had
made their appearance when this paper
was put to press.
It is aflerted in a paper of the tSthirtft
printed a t S:ockbridge (fays a corivfpori

(liire, a collected majority or the people ol
the United States would applaud from the
heart, the Supreme Executive's non-ac
knov. ledgment of the ambanador from the
French republic." Such a fentiinent inuft
lie conlidered as difgraceful to Americans
as it is deilitute of truth ; and could only
have originated with some rotten hearted
fellow that would fell his country to Bri
tain for a "funding system."
Captain Storer, who arrived at New-
York on Monday last, from Charleston, in-
I'orms, that on Sunday the 14th infl. he saw
1 large Englilh flup from Bremen, going
into Charleston harbour, which had been
made a prize of by the French frigate I'E.m-
Tufcadeâthat i'ome French merchants in
Charleston were fitting out privateers;
:he l'ljmbufcade continued to cruize olf
Charleston, making thi bar in the morning,
and then (landing off the remainder ot the
:lay : and that the Britilh merchants there
were fearful to let their vessels leave port.
The French ambassador was in Charlcl
:on when Capt. Storer failed.
Capt. Storer further informs, that the
commander of the TEmbufcade, in order
:o render himfeif more secure, had offered
a lieutenant's coinmiffion in the French na
i'y, to any American who would undertake
:o att is pilot 011 board his vessel, and that
:he offer was embraced by Capt. Witti
liore of Boston.
" The public mind has been for some
:ime in a (tare of fufpence, as to the part

eded on all hands, that our best infercfts

>ythe proclamation of the executive, which

" It iÂ» extremrly happy for this country
hat no treaty exists interfering with tin

laired y a diminution of our in portand

The object of a'l union of men in Soci
ety, being the maintaining of natural, civil,
and political righ s these rights ought to
be the bafts of the foiial compad. The
acknowledgnient and declaration of them
ought to precede the conllitution which
allures the guarantee of them.
Art I. Natural, civil, and political
rights, are liberty, equality, fecuri'y, and
property, the social contrad, and resis
tance of oppreflion.
2. Li erty consists in the power of do
ing every thing which is rot contrarv to
the right of ano her. Thus the exercre
of this natural right has no other limits
than those which secure to the members
of the f me society the enjoyment of the
fame right.
3 Every citizen oupht to submit to the
law which is the expr.flion of the gene
ral will. Whatever is not forbidden by the
law, cannot be prohibited ; and none can
be conllrained to do what it does nut en
join.
4 Every man has the liberty of mani
festing his thoughts, and his opinions.
5 The lib rty of the press, and every
other means of making known his fenti-
cannot be forbid Jen, suspended,
or limited.
6 Every citizen is free in the exercise
of his re'igion.
7 Equality consists in the enjoyment of
the f..me rights by every ci izen.
8 The law is equal to all, whether it
proteds or punithes.
9 All citizens are equally admifiible
to all appointments. Free people know
no other motive of preference than pre
eminence of talents and virtue.
I j Security confills in the protedion
granted to all the u'tizens, for the pre
fervation of their persons, of their fortunes,
and of their rights.
II None can be accused, (lopped, or
detained, but in cases pecifird by the
law, and according to thi forms it hÂ«8 pre
scribed.
12 Th<[citizens against whom arbitra
fy atts may be exercised, have the right
to refilt then. byf-rce; but every man
accused or arrelted in virtue of the law,
ought to o<.ey it inllantly. He rende s
hiinfelf guilty by r fiftance, (N. B. a mtf
take in the order )
13 Those who so icit, expedite, exe
cute, or cause to be executed ar -ittaty
or .ers, are guilty, and ought to be punch
ed.
14 Every man ought to be prefnmed
innocent, till he has been declaied guilty;
if it is found neceiTary toanvft h 111, eve
ry rigo' not reqnifite to secure his person
ought to be severely interdided by the
law.
15 None can be punilhed but in virtue
of a law ellablifhed and promulgated an
terior to the crime, and lega'ly applied.
16 Every law which pum(his crimes
anterior to it promulgation is an arbi
trary ad. Every retrofped effed of law
is i crime
17 The law ought only to inflict ne*
cess .ry pi.nifl ment proportioned to the
crimes and ufeful to society.
18 The right of property is, that every
man may difpole of his substance, his
talents, and his industry.
19 No kind of labour or industry is
prohibited to citizens, who may buy,
fell, or transport it freely.
20 A c tizen however, cannot fell
himfelf, his petfon not being a.ienable
propei ty.
21 None can be deprived of iiis right
of property, but when public necessity,
leg-illy proved, evidently demands it,
and on condition of a just and previous
indemnity.
22 No contiibution can be levied but
for the public goad : all citizens have a
right to assent to its ellablifhment.
23 Public inllrudion is neceflary to all
24 Public luccours ate a debt due from
society.
25 The security of these rights is an
ast of sovereignty.
26 Sovereignty is one, indivisible, and
imprescriptible.
27 It resides eflentially in the people.
E ch citizen is equally entitled to exer
cife Sovereignty.
28 No individual, or any union of citi
zens can arrogate to themselves the ex
eicifes of Sovereignty.
29 The social compad cannot cxift,
where the limits of powers are not exad
ly fixed, and where agents are not made
vefponfible for their conduit.
30 All citizens are obliged to be aiding
to the law.
31 Men united in society ought to
have a legal means t)f refilling oppreflion.
32 There is oppreflion when the law
violates natural right, the<-e is oppreflion
when the law is violated by the public
fundionaries. There is oppreflion when
arbitrury ads violate natural,civil, and po
liti al rights of citizens. The manner
of refilling oppreflion ought to be prescri
bed by the conllitution.
33 The people have the right ofchange
ing the conllitution. One generation has
no 1 ight to fubjed to the conltitution fu
ture generations.
After the recognition of these rights,
on which the government is founded, the
French nation is declared to form one in
elivifible r public.
'I he division into departments is retain

communes or diltricts, &each commune in

number of those candidates who have moil
votes, and from those sent ba k to the
primaly aflemblies ; a definitive eledion is
made, eac citizen giving in as before, Â«
lift of the candidates to whom he gives his
preference.
In the deliberations of these aflemblies,
the fame mode is to be followed as in the
eledions. Th; qtieftion is to be shaped so
as to be answered by a fnnple negative or
affirmative. On the day appointed for
the decision, each citizcn g'ves in a bulletin,
