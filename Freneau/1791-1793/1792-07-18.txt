PARIS, May io.
The fahfequent obfcroations have a retrofpetl
to the Manifefloes tjju:dby the house of
Aujlria and their G'rterals in the Bra
bantine provinces, to jujltfy the combination
of that and certaik other continental powers
againjl the reformed Government and Con-
Jlitution of France.
"X TOTHING can afford a cTeaterproof
jj%| that governmental reformation is
far beh nd national reformation, than the
principles which the Governors general in
the Low Countries have dared to publjfh
and disseminate in their proclamations. We
there find aflertions the moit ralie, ii.ipUi.a
tions the mo(l {laiirierous, ar. denial
of fa&s the inoft notorious. They deny,
for instance, that the emigrant â  have either
been protected or tolerated in Germany ?
and that French travellers and residents in
those dominions have been infintcd, abuled
and plundered. This audacious impu
dence 'hat can coolly deny f.ifts known to
all Europe, is not new in their fyflem of
politics. What is mo'.t a(toni!:.:ng is, the
delibera'e coolness with v/l::ch delpoufm
publishes the catechism oi its laitn, and
repeats the ancient creed, r.t the present
period, Â£3 it would have dene thirty years
arro. The sacred name of God is intro
duced to f<i nation their worie than Gothic
abul'es of true government, the perpetuity,
we may fay, the eternity of the moll ab
surd institutions. couched under the rcfpcc
table appellation of fundamental laws,
but in fact, annihilating the right, of men,
who have tacitly renounced thoie rights,
merely foe the benefit of affaciating toge
gether, and living under a depot.fm, that
lias made them its absolute poifefiion and
property. And these are the b.:fo princi
ples which are preached up to Europe at
nearly the close of the eighteenth century
These proclamations leave not a doubt,
but that there is a combination amongst
the despotic powers of Europe against the
cause of liberty and human nature. Ihe
war then, will includ in its issue a cause
more interesting to m:.n than ever the an
nals of man have witnefied. It is tne war
of reason against prejudice ; it is a confi'.ft
between all that is great and generous in
man, and those hate-ful paflions which de
grade him to the nature of a bru e ; it is
the spirit of liberty adlinÂ£ against pride,
rage, and superstition. Upon the event
of this war depends the rapid advancement
or the retrograde movement of civilization.
The annals of no nation whatever, that we
know of, has presented jfiich a profpeft as
is now before us Art thou a Frenchman ?
âthy name is written iu the firft pa es of
the book of renovated manâbe if thine,
then, to support and extend the glory of
your nation. Situated almost in the midst
of Europe, here is the luminary l hut mud:
dart its rays from the eentre to the circum
ference ; be it our part to fight, and ra
therdie than fufFer't to be extinguished !
Rome, dpril 24. In the vicinity of
Frefcati, have been lately discovered the
remains of the ancient city of Gabii,
which was overwhelmed many ages ago by
the eruptions of Vesuvius. In the firll
digging many fragments of marble pillars
have been discovered, the ruins of temples,
and mutilated (tatties. This fortunate dis
covery promises fair to enrich ou/cabiaets
with precious antiques, the invaluable re
mains of the genius and arts of ancient
Italy.
Strasbourg, May 8. The declara
tion of war, by the AfTembly, has produ
ced here the mull lively emotions of joy.
Our troops are in high spirits, and eager
to engage the mercenaries of Auflria.
This, in a great measure, is due to the
flcilful arrangements, zeal, and patriotism
Â«f Marechal Luckner. This officer pof

feffes in the higheil degree the confidence
of the army, and if conduced by him,
will do every thing that men can do. He
is one of those few men who can derive ad
vantages even from misfortune. The late
difaftroivs events at Mons and Tournay,
have determined him to enforce the mod
rigid discipline, to prevent such disasters in
future, and ensure success. The following
is theaddrefs he made to his army on this
fubjeft, on the Â£th instant.
" Marechal Luckner informs the army
and the citizens that have taken up Â»rm3
for the maintenance of liberty, that the
whole amount of the .killed in the repulle
from Mons and Tournay, is about one
handled and fifty men. The Marechal is
fa ly fenfihle that this failure of fucceis
cannot but rc-animate the courage of all
tire Frenchmen. He well knows they
are worthy to be a free nation, and as such
capable of struggling against the blasts of
ndverfc fortune. By a fteadineis and re
solution, charafterii'uc of brave men, who
are fighting for their rights, they will soon
learn how to carry off the victory from
hostile mercenaries.âAs to hiir.felf, (the
General said) his duty as a good citizen,'
was to use his authority and experience, to
inftruft those under his command in those
rigid duties of discipline, by which alone
victory couid be purchasedâto guide
them, to habituate them to the arduous
toils of war, and to teach them all, that it
is only by submitting the energy that ani
mates them to the direction of their chiefs,
that they can acquire or preserve the
ascendancy that should characterize the
soldiers of liberty.
Stockholm, April 26. Yefierday ar;
end was put to the life and torments o!
Ankerftrom. His right'hand was cut ofT
firft, then his head. His body was then
quartered, and his limbs transfixed upon
(lakes. This, however, was not the day
of his greatest torments ; he h id become
much weakened by the torturesof the pre
ceding days, and his refulal to take any
kind of nouri/hmer.t, mu'.t have entirely
blunted his nervous sensations. Daring
O
the tnree days preceding his execution,
he was cruelly tortured with rods, so that
when he went to his execution he was ra
ther dragged along, than walked. His
sentence included confifcation of property,
but the duke rege nt would not allow the
exercise of this barbarous right, and re
nounced it in favorof Ankerllrom's chil
dren, who are to change their name, as
well as every other family in the kingdom
that went by the name.
Wax saw, April 21. Orr revolution
is far from being completed. We have
however nothing to fear in our own terri
tories: all the danger is from without ;
and we are more appreheniive than ever of
Ruffian and German troops being fern a
mongst us.
Frankfort, May lo Since war has
been declared by France against Austria,
the German courts have throvm of the
masque, and juftify the suspicions long en -
tertained by the French, that the pro
feffions of neutrality and friendlhip, by
some of them, were altogether hypocriti
cal. They now speak openly, and the
ancient policy of the Germanic body is ne
cessitated to yield to the peculiarity of cir
cumllances. Some of the members of that
body greaiy fear the dissemination of
French principles in the'r states ; others
are the vile tools of more potent princes,
to whom they have always bowedâa fmali
number, who are wife, wifil to take no
part in the quarrel with France, but are
forced to furnifh their contingent, whe
ther they will or not.
Valenciennes, May it. General
Rochambeau has not yet received official
notice of his lefignation being accepted by
the King, or that Marshall Lilckner will
succeed him. Hia army, who lincerely
love him,are on his account greatly alarm
ed. The Aullrian enemy, having infor
mation of our intestine divilions, and the
difcontcnt of a part of ths troops, leem
disposed to press hard upon our northern
army. Our forces, however, are brave ant:
ivell disci' lined, "nd those who have erred]
are impatient to repair their fault.
Pari':, May 14. The Minister for home
affairs has exprefied rears for the fafety oi
this capital. Paris is become the theatre oi
intrigue, and the resort of counter-revolu
tioni'.ls, end designing milcreants. A pro

}e. ;rd-: r, by M. Ifnard, to banish all
p Weil 3 and others, who underreligious pre
texts continued to disturb the peace of the
kingdom. To this it was objected, that an
c jrefs law could not be enacted against
\ ..iefts, without an outrage upon renfon and
piiilofophy. The legislature knows neither
leligion nor minillers cf religion, and can
fingie out 110 fe& or body of men
eiiher to be persecuted or prote&ed. Any
law that on'y inclines the word pr'iejl re
calls the idea of corporations, which are
wholly incompatible with the spirit of the
n ;w laws.
At the Assembly's fitting of yederday,

at Avignon Several dispatches were
.ev/ife received from the minister for fo
reign affairs, announcing the declared
n<. itraiity of several powers during the
present war. In these are included Eng
land, Spain, Sweden, B.ivaria, and the
Duke of Wirtemberg.âThefe would be
il"! more worthy of praise, if they had de
clared, actively, in our favor. Letters
from Valenciennes are cor.flantly coming

o! the French soldiers belonging to the
northern army, for_ what has happened

been committed, in giving too much heed
to traitorous insinuations.

Warsaw, April 30. Evefy difpatel
from Ruflia brings us more and more dif
quiet. The court of Russia wiil not heai
a word cf our new constitution, and theii

consisting of 70,000 men. Our eourl
has held an extraordinary fitting \on this
alarming news : the King, in confquencs
thereof, has exhorted the Hates to remair
firm to the constitution, and that if ne
cefiTary he would march at the head of the
national forces to oppose invasion. The

Accounts down to the last of May re
ceived from Londonderry, by the ship Ma

represent Ireland as at the eve of a revolu

A long lift of some of the mcft refpefla

their papers to countenance the two fol

which have arisen from a neglect of the
acknowledged principles of their constitu

the people in parliament. Secondly, To se

The fuin of ready money (lays a Lon

building, repairing and equipping have
gone on without a moment's jfitermiffion ;
and they have-at this time an unexpected
number of frigates ready to put to sea to
protect their own trade against cruisers.
They do not mean, however, to commit
depredations on their enemies, by sea.
The despotic combination in Europe
seems directed not merely against France,
but against Poland also, whose new consti

publish the moll flattering accounts of the
prosperity and grandeur of that Country.
Some of the Clergy* a few of the Nobili

been llrongly pictured by many late wri

in forne of your late papers, I beg leave to
communicate one from a late publication
on agriculture. Mr. Marshall, in his" Mid

incomprehensible how a common farm la

board ; which however did not cost him
much. The poor devil had fometimei
bread and sometimes cheese, and feme'
times neither, with seldom any thing but
water to drink. His lodging cost hirr
nothing. He built himfelf a hut with
flubs and Tods, a cone seven feet wide al
the base, on the inside and four feet higli
in the center. The floor divided by a long
log : one fide littered with flraw for a
lodging room : the other furnifhed with a
loose log as a fitting room."
