In the House of Rep rel'enutivea,
Monday, April 30.
Mr. STEELE'S Remarks on the EXCISE
LAW.
"The report of the committee of the whole,
concerning the modifications of the fcxcjz
Law, under confiderauon.]
Mr. STEELE moved to strike out
eight cents and infertftx, upon the tirft
class of spirits difkilled from fruit or
grain within the United States. 1 his
motion, he laid, had failed in commit
tee, but upon reflection the house might
probably exprels a different opinion,
and with that hope he was induced to
renew the motion. When a proportion
has for its balis justice as well as policy,
it cannot lofeadvocates by conhderation,
and several days having elapsed ftnee
the former dilcuffion, a well grounded
aflurance is entertained that the prelent
attempt will not be wholly unfuccclsful.
Tha object of the prcfent bill is
to remove objections and, if pollible,
render that mode of taxation more
palatable to the community. If
therefore it can be proved that neither
of thele delirablc ends can be attained
without reducing the duty, common
sense suggests the propriety of doing it.
The manner in which this law is now
executed has difgracefully committed
the dignity of the general government,
and a lcnTc of national honor requires
that one of two things should be done;
either that the law be totally repealed,
or fully executed. If the latter be the
determination of the government, it can
not be productive without reducing the
rate, Amplifying its operations, and, in
many rclpects, rendering if less excep
tionable to the people. It has been en
aCted now near twelve months, and in.
that time it cannot be said to have been
well executed in all, or productive in
any part of the United States, in the
degree which was originally expeCted.
The Secretary of the Treasury has
propofed,in his report, that in certain
instances the proprietors of stills should
be allowed to discharge the amount of
their refpeftive duties in the producc
of the distilleries. This, fir, will be an
accommodation to the diliillers, but
while it answers this beneficial purpo
se to them, it operates as a flrong ar
gument in favor of a reduChon of the
duties. If reasonably reduced, an in
dulgence so unfavorable to the public
would not be demanded or expeCted.
The present motion is made under a
conviction (resulting from a confidcr
able knowledge of the nature of grain
diftillei ies, and of the circumftanccs of
Ihe country where they are molt in ulc)
1 hat the treasury win ifcccive more
money from a duty of fix than nine
ccnts upon the gallon.
Mr. Steele then begged the house to
rccolleCt that this is the firft attempt to
introduce a system of excise into the
U. States ; that it is too the firft attempt
to tax any article of American growth
or manufacture ; that the law requires
a surrender of at least one fourth part
of the value of the thing excised, and
that not only the justice of the measure
is denied, but its policy is doubted.â
The neccflitics of the government are
so interwoven at this time with its po
licy, that it is not easy for this, or any
other measure relating to revenue, to
undergo the proper cÂ«nfideration, or to
be decided fimplyupon its merits. The
opposition to this law has not proceeded
from a restless and disorderly spirit
among the people, but from an averiion
which freemen in all countries everhacl
and perhaps ever will have to this
mode of taxation. Andbt ingenious
rheorifts refine as they please upon the
nature of indireCt taxes, it mud always
be admitted that exciles retrench the
liberty of the citizens on whom they
operate, and that they are fubjcCt to so
lid as well as plauftfcle objections. Ithasalready been the fubjgcl of much com
plaint in many parts of the unidi), and vvi'.l
be productive of furious consequences if
these complaints be not redrefled by the le
gislature, in the present feilion. Among the
causes of diflatisfaCtion are the following:
ift, Excite la\es are novel in the United
States, andodiofis in their nature ; 2d, Ar
ticles of American manufacture are no:
proper objefrs of taxation, and if they were,
the rate of duty ill this instance is too high;
"d, The proportion which was efiabHhied
between the rate of duties on molasses, rum,
and spirits distilled from fruit and grain,
tends to the encouragement of the former,
at the expence and depreliioli of the latter ;
4th, Because it operates, and is in fait, r.
tax upon this occupation and agriculture,
as they stand connected in one part of the
union, while manufactures in other part
are not only rewarded by high protecting
duties, but in fame instances-even by fpeci
iied bounties.
The agricultural interest has experienced
the unfavorable influence of this iaw like
wile, and it operates ii'.oft opprcflively too
upon that class of farmers whose e/tates are
fituatcd in the interior country, and whose
interests have thus far passed almost unno
ticed, in the policy of the genera! govern
ment. That class of citizens, though they
have not been moll folicitotis, are hever
tiielefsnot insensible of their burthens, and
the neglect with which their interelt has
been treated.
The value cf our lands has been station
ary lor fume time : their produce not 111 de
mand, and where it is, at depreciated prices:
and notwithstanding this, taxes are impo
sed, evidently calculated in their operation
to render agriculture tributary to the more
favored branches of business.
No argument can be advanced that will
justify the imposition of burthens upon the
cultivation of the foil, for the aggrandise*
ment of manufactures,' or the emolument
of those concerned in thym.
Mr. Steele then said he would put a cafe,
which is a familiar one in the date which
he represents, and might be so in others. 11
a farmer is poffelTed of a given quantity of
rye ior <aie, money cannot be obtained for
it at any priceâhe fends it to a diltillery.
where one half is given in the lirft instance
for mantifafruriiig the other. The duty is
then to be paid out of ttie farmer's part,
which reduces the balance to less than one
t i:rd o! the original quantity. If this is
â j:ot an oppressive tax. I am at a Iof; to tlef
cnbe what is so ; and if a proportion had
been ma.le to lay ailmilartax upon Ameri
can porter, na:ls, paper, (hoes, or any other
article of this kind, we should not ihortly
have heard the last of it. And here let me
alk, what is in the nature of these manu
factories which entitles them to fucli priori
ties and preferences :' It may fairly be an
i-ver.d, that they are nearer to perfection
that they are aided by more capital, that
they are therefore better able to bear taxa
tion, and that the advantages which they
now erroy have been derived from the ge
nerality of members representing the agri
cultural parts of the country. It is moll
iincerely to be wulied that the manufactur
ing dates would fix some bou ids to their
expectations and that they will not conti
nue to insist upon unreasonable lacrifices
from those who are engaged in different
juii'fu;ts, and little able to make them.
The tendency of this law has been, and if
not differently modified, will continue to
be, to build up the rum distilleries upon the
ruins ot those employed by farmers for do
mestic uses. These are not suggested to be
the motives which actuated any part of the
majority in palflng this law originally, or
which now influence the zealous oppolition
to the present motion ; but as the reduction
of the tax is objected to principally by gen
tlemen, who on Other occasions have been
anxious to aifdrdlegiflative aid to American
manufacture , it is not uncharitable to fay
that their lingular conduit now might juf
tify such an imputation.
If this has not be ,'n the policy, my mo
tion for the proposed reduction will indu
bitably prevail.
Mr. Steele then called the attention of
the house to the system of federal taxation
ingene aland instanced several duties which
operate unfavorably to the landed interest,
in the (outlier!) parts of the Union. Parti
cularly the high duty on fait, nails, shoes,
â and other eflential articles in husbandry,
with which the peopie of those Hates are ai
molt \\ holy Supplied from foreign markets.
The enhanced price of fait and nails are
seriously complained of in tho.fe frates, be
en re tii? one is efieatial to the improve
ment of their large stocks of cattle ; and
the article of nails is in very extenflve use
becaulie the country is improving in build
ings, and yet to be improved. The tax up
on these articles cannot be felt in an equal
.degree in the northern and eastern states sot
very obvious real'ons.
It has been frequently aflerted in the
conrfe of this debate, that distilleries in the
eastern states have flourifiied and are grow
ing up under the operation of this law,
which, if true, is an unaufwerable argu
ment in proof of its inequality. 111 the
foutheru states they sre cramped, in many
initances annihilated, and the secretary,
fenlible of this, has in his report proposed a
temporary expedient of allowing (he dif
jjllgrsfhe privilege of discharging the du-
tie~ on the (pint-: difhlied ' t cer'.a.n ftjpnla-
ted prices. Tnis is pl-ilnly admitting the
truth of an aliertiou which has of cen heen
repented, that the law, in its operation,
won id he found unequal and opprefiive.
In order to vote Underflandingly on the
present queltion, we ou;j;ht to have been
iiirnii'hed from the trei.fury, with a (tatc
ment of the neat amount of revenue ac
cruing from nioiaficG diflillatlon, after de
dll fling the drawbacks upon the motafle?
dilHUed and the rum export*:!. 7 his, com
pared with the amount accruing from the
tifhliacion of American produce, on which
d drawback is seldom demanded, wc.ld be
placing the fnbjeÂ£t in a proper point or view
for a lati factory decision. This statement
ihopld now be called for, if the late hour of
the feJion cl. cl not render it impracticable.
A gentleman from Maflachufefcs, (Mr.
Ames) in the course of his remarks, ha-
Rated, that the existing proportion is fuf
nciently favorable to the distilleries em
ployed in grain and fruit. For that the
American made rum now pays, including
the duty op. niolafies, thirteen cents per gÂ«l
--lon, while its rival liquor of common qual
ity, is oily (abject to nine tents. 'i'his is
true, :is it relates to the consumers within
tne United States, and, if none was expor
ted, might be lefsexceptionable :âbut how
does it operate upon the American distil
lers ? Ole in Maflachufetts makes a certair
quant ty of rum for exportation ; it is ex
ported, and of course pays no duty ; while
another, in North Carolina, makes/an equal
quantity of spirits, from fruit and grain,
wholly from home cor.fuuiption, and it and
chargeable for the full amount of the du
ties. But admitting them both to be arti
cles of American manufacture, and alike
entitled to legifiative prote&ion ; is there
any colour ci jtiuice in taxing rum, (which
by the ettimation of the gentlemen them
selves, is wo"th, in the market, at leaf! twe
thirds of a dollar per gallon) only ten cents,
when you propose to tax spirits made from
grain, which is worth in the market, bu!
halt as much, eight cents ? The inequality
is so glaring, that if the motion is decided
on principle it mull succeed, and if it do;:
there is good reason to b'tlieve that the peo
pie will be disposed to give the law a fair
experiment, even in places where it lia
been hitherto least palatable.
Fms, Sir, may not improperly be termed
a between two dalles of citizens,
whoie mrerefts are, and will be for some
year;, diilimilar ; the agricultural and ma
nufafturiijgparts cf the United States. I.
is not the firlt conflict of the kin i, and may
not, perhaps, be the lailâ and if we mr,
j'.idge experience, it will not be diia
cult to predict how it will terminate.
However, vrh:le facts and principles are
-ii or of the motion, we lhall be ittfii fir.'
ill contending for w ? hat we have nothereto
tore had, " coinlitutional equality, and im
partial legislation."
11 may once ior ail be remarked, without
expecting it will have any influence on the
house, that a great majority of my confti
tuenta hold in deteii.ition the name as well
as the nature of an exc'.fe la-.v, and that
they would have been among the fir it to re
monltrate, if they had not been fully fenii
ble that their representatives would speak
their sentiments and describe their feeling;
whenever a proper occalion fiioald occur.
This is deemed to be that proper occa
lion, these are their sentiments, delivered
in the language of sincerity ; if they are dis
regarded, the members from thattlate have
dil'charged their duty, and will not be an
swerable for the con.equences.
But it has been said by a gentleman from
Pennsylvania (Mr. Fitzfimons) tiiat if the
duty be reduced to fix cents, agreeably tc
my motion, it will not be worth collecting,
i o this it may be plainly answered, thatli
'he duty be not reduced, it cannot, njr will
not be collected.
