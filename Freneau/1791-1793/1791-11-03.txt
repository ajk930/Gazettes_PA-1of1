HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF
THE UNITED STATES.
MONDAY, OElobcr 31.
Nathaniel niles and ifraei
Smith, from Vermont : Upton
Sheredine, from Maryland; William
Barry Grove, from North-Carolina ;
and Robert Barnewell, from South-Ca
rolina, appeared and took their feats.
Several petitions were read, viz. iMom
lames Beers, Leonard Walter, Ma'ga
ret Flour, Isaac Richards, Jedidiah
Brown, William Haburn, John fox,
and Elizabeth Eafton, praying compen
sation for wounds received and services
tendered in the army of the United
States, during the late war.âSaid pe
titions were severally referred to the be
cretary at War.
A petition from Richard Blackledge,
praying compensation for a quantity ot
leather, furnilhed in the late war ; which
was referred to the Secretaiy o tav.
Treasury.
A memorial from Joseph Ceracchi. an
Italian Sculptor, proposing to execute
on a certain del'ign, and conditions, a
monument to perpetuate American li
berty and independence.
According to the order of the day,
the' House rcfolved itfelf into a com
mittee of the whole on the schedule or
enumeration of the inhabitants ot the
United States.âln debating upon this
fubjeft,
Mr. Lawrance observed, that the ra
tio of representation andfome provision
refpefttng S. Carolina were the princi
pal obje&s in view. He meant to pro
pose a resolution relative to the repre
sentation, after which he thought the
committee might defer the further con
sideration of this fubjeft for some days,
that gentlemen might have time to make
up their minds upon the hufitiefs. He
then moved, that till the next census be
taken, one member should continue to
be the rcprefentative of thirty thousand
inhabitants.
Mr. Livermore thought that the de
termination of their constituents ought
to be previously known on the amend
ment to the conflitution, proposing that
the representation of one for every thir
ty thousand do continue until the num
ber of Representatives shall amount to
one hundred. The people's agreeing
to that amendment would oppose the
motion before the House. If the peo
ple rejected the amendment, he fliould
oppose so large a representation as one
for every thirty thousand.
Several other gentlemen having spok
en on the fubjeft,
Mr. Sedgwick, after reading to the
House a calculation he had made, {latins
the number by which eacn slate won c
be represented, according to the several
ratios of representation, obierved, that
the general sense of the people seemed
to be that the number of representa
tives (hould be one hundred until m
creafed by the ratio of one to forty thou
sand. He thought the ratio of 33 or
04.000 more conformable to public opi
nion than anv other number ; but that
011 this fubjeÂ£t the House had nothing
whereon to found their conclusions ;
for his own part he wished the Hou.c
of Representatives always to coniiit ol
about one hundred members.
Mr.Livermore was for the ratio of on(
to forty thousand. The Houle woulc
then consist of about eighty members.
This v.-ould give less occasion for com
plaints of expence, and the public, ir
his id'*s. would be equally well served
He v/iftied the House, if they fettled an)
ratio might adopt that of one to 40,000

THURSDAY, November 3, I 79 1 -
Mr. White, said that the general
â¢oice of the people was for an increalcd
eprefentation at certain dated periods.
3ne to thirty thousand feerned to be the
general idea. The amendment propof
*d might not always give one to thirty
:houfand, but it would secure an m
;reafc of the representation as the po
pulation of the country increased. lie
concluded with wishing the Houie
would not immediately decide on the
fubjeft.
Mr. Dayton wifbed the motion to lay
over till tomorrow for further conlidei
atioh. He thought the general fcnti
ment to be in favour of thirty thouland,
but as a medium between the oppolite
opinions, he moved an amendment foi
thirty-five thousand.
Mr. Seney was against any hasty de
cisions, especially when the Houie was
so thin of members as at present. Upon
i motion of his to that purpose, the
:ommittee rose, reported progress, and
ifked leave to fit again.
Mr. Smith (S. CTJ wished that the
late of South-Carolina might be allow
;d a longer time to make a return o
heir cenlus, the enumeration being not
yret completed, but would be io in a
"hort time. He therefore made a motion
;o this effect which was ordered to lie
Dn the table.
Mr. Sedgwick, Mr. Bourne (M.) and
Mr. White were appointed acommittee

ilfo providingthe mode by which apei
ion held to ferviceor labour in one State
under the laws thereof, escaping into a
nother, fliall be delivered up, on claim
of the party to whom such service or la
bour may be due.

LONDON, Sept. 6.
The l'pirit of the Navigation ast has
for lome time past been completely de
feated, by the having become
the general carriers of all our tranf-at
lantic commerce. Congress have, for
nearly twelve months past enacted an
additional port duty, amounting to near
Jool. Sterling upon the entrance of any
Britilh {hip freighted with British mer
chandize. Notwithstanding this, Amer
ican vellels still continue to pay nothing
more on their arrival in England than the
common alien duty; which is so trifling,
that our ports are now full of their {hip
ping, who get freighted immediately,
while English Ihips usually employed in
that trade, lay useless in the docks with
brooms at their mast-heads denoting
them only for sale. Surely some imme
diate measure will be adopted by Gov
ernment, to give at least an equal share
of the carrying trade to our own velfels.
and not to fuffer the whole thus to fall
into the hands of our revolted colonists,
to the manifeft injury and degradation
of the British marine.
SAVANNAH, Ottober 6.

Mr. Ellicott (lately arrived from the

Last week, Capt. Barker arrived
here from Nantz, which port he left the
i3thof September. Burrill Carnes,
Esq. Contulfrom the United States for
the port of Nantz, came palfenger with
him.
When Capt. Barker left Nantz, the
people wereexpefting with pleal'ure the
royal acception of the Constitution,
which ast they would consider as com
pleting the revolution, and establishing
their political happiness. The King's
refufal of it would be considered as the
signal for an attempt at a counter-revo
lution.
Tranjlaiions from the papers brought by
Capt. Barker.
Brandenburgh, Aug. 16. Accord
ing to general opinion, confirmed in eve
ry quarter, we doubt not an intended al
liance between Aujiria and Prvjfia.

conjectures, when we fee the House of
Aujiria and the King of Prujfia in confi
dence, so contrary to the face of affairs.
Madrid, Aug. 18. M. Count de
Laify, Commandant in Catalonia, has
ordered the Consul of France, residing
at Barcelona, to leave Spain. A de
tachment of Grenadiers conducted him
to the Frontiers of Franee. This French
Patriot is accuf'ed of imprudent propo
lals against the Spanish Government,
and of having spoken favorably of the
French Revolution.
BOSTON, Oa. 25.
A correspondent hopes that Congress
â will in their prel'ent session, compcl the
owners of every ship or veflel, to make
the firft suit of fails of American duck.
This would cffeftually answer the pur
pose of letting up and profccuting the
manufacture of that ufeful and exten
sive article, and be the means of saving
to this country many thcufand pounds
yearly.
BALTIMORE, OSober at
Extracl of a letter from Charge-Town, da
ted. the -lift Instant.
The public Sale of Lot's in the Fed
eral City, ended on W'edpeiday even
ing ; but the private files dill continue,
and probably will all the week. In the
whole, there have been, at lead, twelve
hundred lots "fold.âThe average of the
public sales, is something upwards of
Â£. 100, for a lot of 40 feet front and 130
or 140 deep.âThe sales made by indivi
duals, I fuipeft, were at a lower rate.â
Indeed they have fold, in many parts of
the City, and the public sales were con
lined to that part which lies betwee-n
the Prelidcnt's Square and Georgetown,
which it is imagined, will be firft im
proved, being so convenient to the pre
sent Seat of trade.âtell your Friend
, that it is not yet too late to
make good Speculations ; but that', if he
means to do any thing to the purpofc,
he mull not delay it too long."
OBSERVATIONS ON THE PROSPECTS OF
AMERICA.
{-From a late Connecticut paper. J
PUBLIC inealures, and the proceed
ings of government, are open to the in
fpedion of its citizens, and subject to
their animadversion. Enough appear in
every place to censure, and point out
the deicfts and imperfections incident
to our policy ; but few to show its ex
cellencies : the Citizen undertakes this
pleasing talk, and wishes for the candid
attention of the public, while he takes
a view of the happiness and advantages
hisfellow-citizensofthe (late now enjoy,
and the means of continuing and im
proving them. The firft thing which
itrikes the mind of an attentive obser
ver of the preient situation of Connec
ticut, is her connexion with the general
government. That government is every
day acquiring firmnefs and (lability,
Though the habits, tempers and inter
ests of the various parts of the empire
are so different, that in speculation we
should pronounce it impoflible for the
members of the general government to
unite in any public mealures; yfet ex
perience has shewn that mutual conde-
Icenlion will surmount tliefe obstacles,
and enable the conductors of this great
political machine to proceed in such a
manner as to give general fatisfaction.
Our remote situation from other na
tions promises long peace ; they will
not be fond of contending with ap em
pire so fall eucreafing, so firmly eftab
liflied, and having such powerful re
lources at command. The causes which
create war among European powers, do
not here exist ; and we have'nothing to
fear to disturb the public tranquility,
unlcfs it be the petty depredations of the
Indians on our frontiers, which a small
exertion of the military power will easi
ly quell.
The general government being of our
own appointment, the members of it
being responsible to the people, and their
conduct eXposed to public censure, they
have every inducement to conduct with
integrity ; so that if we ast wifely in the
choice of our officers, we have little to
fear from internal oppression. While
the citizens of Connecticut view them
selves as a refpe&ablepart of so flourifh
ing an empire the profpeft appears pe
culiarly pleasing ; equally pleasing is it
also to view our owndomeftic situation,
policy and government.
By emigration from abroad, and po
pulation at home, our empire encreafes
with a rapidity that astonishes European
calculators, and which will soon fill the
extensive regions of the weft. By a ju
dicious management of ourrefources,our
revenue hath already become respec
table, and placed public credit on a per
manent bahs. So that those who are in
tcrefted in the public funds, consider
their property as reftingon a firm foun
dation. The lale of the western lands,
and duties wifely laid onluch articles of
foreign goods as we do not need, and as
ought to bear a high price, will proba
bly be fufficient to discharge the public
demands, and pay the price of our in
dependence, without burthening the
people with direst taxes. A government
with iuch resources and revenues firmly
established, becomes refpeftable abroad.
Foreign nations fear her power, and co
vet her alliance. Her flag which dis
plays itfelf in every commercial port, is
universally honored.

Following address :
S I R,
THE senate of the United States have receiv
td with the highest fatisfailion, the aflurances o
public prol'perity contained in your speech to botl
houses : 'the multiplied blefiings of Previdenci
have not escaped our notice, nor failed to excu';
our gratitude.
The benefits which flow from the reftoratior
of public and private confidence, are confpicuou
and important, and the pleasure with which wt
contemplate them, is heightened by your furthei
afiurance of those further communications whicl
shall confirm their existence and indicate their
source.
Whilst we rejoice in the success of those mili
tary operations which have been directed againfl
the heftile Indians, we lament with you the ne-
Ceffity that ha 3 produced them,,and we partici
pate the hope, that the present profped of a ge â 
neral peace, on terms of moderation and justice.
may be wrought into complete and permanent
e-ffetft, and that the measures of government may
equally embrace the security of our frontiers, and
the general interests of humanity ; our solicitude
to obtain, will insure our zealous attention to, an
object so warmly espoused by the principles oi
benevolence, and so highly interesting- to the ho
nor and welfare of the nation.
The several fubje&s which you have particu
larly recommended, and those which remain of
former fefiionj, will engage our early considera
tion ; we are encouraged to prolecute them with
alacrity and fleadinefs, by the belief that they
will interest no paflion, but that for the general
welftwe, by aflurance of concert, and by view of
t-hofe arduous and important arrangements which
have been already accomplilhed.
We observe, fir, the constancy and activity of
your zeal for the public good. The example
will animate our efforts to promote the happiness
of Our country.
Signed by order and in behalf of the Senate.
JOHN ADAMS, Vice-President of the United
States, and President of the Senate.
The PRESIDENT'S Reply.
Gentlemen,
THIS manifeftation of your zeal for the.honor
and happiness of our country, derives its lull va
lue from the lhare which your deliberations have
already had in promoting both.
I thank you for the favorable sentiments with
which you view the part I have borne in the ar
duous talk committed to the government of the
United States ; and desire you to be allured-that
all my zeal will continue to second those further
efforts for the public, good which are insured
by the spirit in which you are entering on the
present feflion.

The account in our last, conveyed in an ex

defeat of the whites by the negroes on the 25th
of September, proves to be without foundation.

patches from the National AfTembly of old
France.
Letters from Cape-Francois by the Hety,
Capt. Cloufer, arrived here on Monday lad ;
mention an engagement with the blacks in
which, after a bioody co'iteft the negroes were
defeated and driven out of their entrenchments
with the loss of a great number killed and
wounded. The foutb fide and weft end of the
island are tolerably quiet, and although the ne
groes had risen in the neighborhood of Port-au-
Prince, thty had, when the last accounts left the
island, attempted nothing injurious further than
threatening the whites that if certain ptivilegei
were not granted them they would follow the
example of the other insurgents. âIn short, the

[.From a late French Paper.
The retainers to monarchical government tel
is that, " in order to prevent being governed by c
yrant there ought to be a king : That there is left
o be apprehended from a power eflabltjhed ant
'united by law, than from authority usurped by c
hies who acknowledges no other contioul than hi
)wn will and inclination." But have we any rea
son to fear the poflibi lity of an usurper ?âNoâ
I'he dillribution of the kingdom into depart
ments is amply fufEcrent to check all ambitiou;
dcligns of this r.ature ; and that which mishi
lave been called an imprudent confidence be
ore this uleful arrangement took place is now
lbfoltuely free from all danger upon that (core,
rhe extent of France, which is a cireumftanc c
avorable to republican government, does not
cave us room to apprehend that the mere inugi
)f royalty set up in the capital, oan ever beqomc
he tvrant of the nation.
Diftinftion of powers, founded not only upor
aw, but upon a real discrimination ot public
employments is another barrier against tyranny.
The military, the marine, the department ot fv
lance, legislation and courts of jutlice are all dif
:ributed amongst men,whofeeducation,aud habit
ire essentially different ârail thole powers muti
)e destroyed, corrupted, or inu(i even havt
rhanged their very natures, before any one pow

tyranny.
The liberty of the press, the universal use' crl
;eading, and the mulvitude of public papers ant
KeUes are fufficientto preserve the nation frorr
my danger of this kind, lo every man thai
bas read with attention the hiftoiy of the ufur
pation of Cromwell in England, it is evident
[hat one lingle gazette, freely circulating-tin tha
at that time, would have effectually nr
relied the progress of tyranny- it is equally evi
dent that if the people of England had been u
the practice of reading other books than the hi
ble, this political and religious hypocrite wouk
have been umnatked in his outlet, and his Icheme;
rendered abortive. All popular tyrants hay
ever acted under a masque ; the liberty ol la
pre Is tears off this masque, and the moment tlr.
real is fceo, there is nothing more to tear
Let us not then create a real evil to avoid a
imaginary danger.

FRANCE.
Augufl 2,5 â30, 1701.
Tranflaled from L'Argus Patriotk,
a French paper of ejlimation, printed at
Paris.^
The dilaffetted of every denomination, who
lave fled out of this kingdom into foreign coun
ties, are endeavouring to propagate an idea that
['"ranee is to all intents, ruined ; in particular,
hat the people of Paris are in such abject dit
refs as to be ir. want of the mod common n;-
effaries of life, and that every prudent man
las given up the revolution as a defperr.te at
empt. These reports, which perfeflly ccord
vith the wishes of tnod of the European ( ourts,
re carefully circulated, in order to damp the
pints of such nations as would be the moll
ikely to follow the example of Fiance in throv -
ng off the Shackles of defpotifin. It ma\ in
leed be a;H'"rted, in drift truth, that the p inci
lal bufine'fs of certain couits at this lime is to
ilify the National Assembly, and that p rt of
he French nation who have taken up arms to
lefend their liberty.
It is remarkable that the Parisians have goined
n solidity what they have lofl in frivolity. 0 The
pitit of the people increases daily, and i-i raom
if a contemptible fpecics of vanity, the French
ave assumed a noble pride of foul, and a more
ban Roman love of their country. A rcvolu
lon has, in fait, taken place in manners and
norals, as well as in government, and the
harafter of the Parisians, in particular, is entire
j changed. Talents and learning are encou
aged, and though the capital of France mav
icretofore have boafled a more brillant and gay
ppearance than at present, we can fafely fay
hat it never at any time contained so many
appy people.
Augufl 25,
The fcarcitv of money flill continues, and
everal flock-jobbers, that might be named, if
eceflary, have got into the piaÂ£lice of exchartg
ng specie for national notes upon a ccrtain dif
ount on the notes. Nothing can be a flronger
iroof of the return of our citizens to good order,
han the tranquility in which these wretches
arry on their infamous traffic.
Notwithllanding the number of refugees from
r rance is very great, and a very great part of that
lumber completely ruined, as' well as liable to
rial for treason, fhoukfthey return > yet we may
enture to aferm that the greatefl part of them
re neither ruined, nor liable to a legal proccfs.
iven the traitors and parricides would inflanrly
eturn to their country were they alTnred that the
roubles were at an end, and that the new laws
lould be faithfully observed that have been
laded under the fanftion of the gicfent govern
nent.
Augud 30.
Among all the writers who have openly de
lared themselves for the fyflem of anarchy,
:alled republican government, in Fiance, there
ire but two whose opinions seem to have made
iny coriliderable number of proselytes. These
ire, Mr. Thomas Payne, and Monf. Condorcet.
The fird of these is a flranger ; >he other has
litherto supported the character of an honefl
nan, at the fame time he is a weak man, and
laving spent the bed pan of his life in writing
jantgyricS, "and wrangling about the (qtfaringof
he circle, he now pops out of his garret, and
n an jinllant preteijds to refeive a political
problem, which has puzzled the wifefl men of
ill ages.
It is computed that upwards of two hundred
roufand per lions have fled out of France, on ac
ount of the troubles, who have not only drawn
icir incomes out of circulation, but have
ranr.fc 1 ted their moveable property into foreign
ountiks. More than iwo hundred thousand
ithers having IoQ and forfeited their re
nain in the kingdom, in a mofl deplorable date
>f poverty.
Upwards of twenty thousand perfor.s have
his year celebrated the era of the Frcnch Revo
ution in London alone. It mud be remcinber
:d (hat lad .ye-dr the nnrober did not exe ed
leyen hundred. At Dublin also the apned
Volunteers have joyfully commemorated this
great event ; and there has riot been a fiugle
town or city in England, of confequcnccj but
what has honored the day thai gave birth to the
liberties oMranee.Five regiments ofHorfeare flationed in t-he
neighborhood ot London. Mr. Pitt has caught
the anti-federal fever, and is afraid of its be
coming inflammatoryâ if he has recourse to
blccdiii ', his difeife will, doubtless, prove mor
tal.

The following is tranjlzted,from th: original
decree of the National Assembly oj Franct
for abolijhing the Droit d Aubaine.
Augufl b, 1790.
Mr. Barrere, in the name of the Com
mittee of Domains, onthc motion of Mr
MarfanneFonjulianne ; You huvecharg
ed your committee of domains to ojjt 1
their opinion on the fuppreflion of thi
Droit d'Aubaine. The droit (duty
originated at that period when there ex
ifted no intercourle between nations
it belonged to the king, the treasury
the nation, who succeeded to the pro
pertyofthe foreigner, not naturalized
on the event of his death, or of the na
turalized foreigner who died intestate
and of the French citizen, who on leav
ing France, had abandoned his country
Conlidering this duty in its relation tc
the constitution and present laws, it:
fate fcems to be already determined
According to the report of the trealury
the sums anting from this duty are no
great, scarcely amounting to forty thou
lund livres. The committee has enjoin
ed it upon me to offer the followins
draft of a decree for your approbation.
" The National Assembly, having at
tended to the report of the committee o
Domains, and considering that th
Droit de Aubaine is contrary to those fra
ternal principles of affection, whicl
ought to unite all men, be their coun
try or government what it may; conii
ucring further, that this law was efta
blifhedin the most barbarous ages, the'
are of opinion it ought to be abolifhei
in every country whose constitution i
founded upon the rights of men and ci
tizenfhip, and that France, being nov
free, ought to open her bosom to th
whole woi Id, ana invite them to enjo'
under -her mild and benevolent govern
ment, the lacred and inalienable right
of mankindâlt is decreed therefore a
follows :
l; That the Droit de Aubaine and th
right of draw-backs upon property fhal
be forever abolished: and, secondly, ths
all procedures, suits, and enquiries
which maybe founded upon thole right:
or either of them, are forever extin
guifhed and of no effect.
The draft of this decree was thei
adopted unanimously and without de
bate.

proposed by Dr. Price, on IVednefday t/
1 4th of July, at the feajl
thefrft Anniversary of the Revolution 1
France.
Gentlemen,
THE fubjeftof the toast I am goin:
to propose to you, appears to me ver
impoi.ant. In consequence of five war;
in which we have been involved linc<
the Revolution in 1688, the kingdom i
now bending under a heavy load o
debts and incumbrances, which rende
it incapable of meeting another wa
without the utmost danger. For cer
tainly there is a limit, beyond which i
we go in adding to our debts ruin rnufl
follow ; and one more war may bring u:
to that limit.
A long period of peace, therefore
to give us time for the redemption oi
our debts, is necessary to our lecurity,
and perhaps, even to our existence.
In France there is a dilpofition to unite
itfelf to us, by an alliance for maintain
ng and perpetuating peace. Such ai
il fiance would be an union between thi
wo fir ft kingdoms in the world, foi
;he noblest purpose. It would be ar
L-lfe& worthy of that union ofpihlofo
phy to politics, which diftinguiflies th<
present cera of the world. It migh
lave Britain. It would bless the world
md complete the hopes of all the friend
>f human liberty and happiness. 1 cat
ay, from very relpeftable authority
:hat there has been a delign formed ii
the National Afl'embly of France, t<
make a proposal of luch an alliance tc
this country.
Â£i 0 heavenly philanthropies ! well di
'â  you deserve the admiration not only o
'your own country, bat of all countries
â  You have already determinect to renounce
"for ever, all views of conquefl, and all of
; fenfive wars. Tins is an inflance o
1 wisdom and attention to human rvju
â¢ which has no example. But you will d
' more. You will invite Great-Britain t
' join you in this determination, and to en
' ter into a compatt with you for promotin,
: peace on earth and good will amon;
' men."
Gentlemen,
Such are the fruits of that gloriou
evolution which we arc this day cele
nating, Itpromifes a new and bette
irder in human affairs. The passion
A Kings and their Ministers have toi
jften and too long involved nations i)
he calamities of war. But now (thank
othe National APfembly of France) th
ixe is laid to the root of this caul'e o
uiman misery ; and the intrigues o
:ourts are likely to lole their power o
imbroiling the world.
In this kingdom we have been ufei
0 speak of the people of France as ou
natural enemies ; and, however absurd
is well as ungenerous and wicked fuci
anguage was, it admitted of some ex
:ufe while they confided only of a mo
larch andhis slaves. But now, with
piritthat astonishes mankind, and thj
nakes tyrants tremble, they havebrok
heir yoke, they have aflerted thei
rights, and made themselves as free a
mrfelves. In doing this, we have bee:
in example to them. They are no\
jecome an example to us ; and we hav
rcafon to expect, that they will fooi
:rown their glorious work by callin
ipon us to meet them (not as formerly, i
he fields of blood, at the command o
1 despot) but on the lacred ground o
iberty, to embrace us as brethren, t<
exchange vows with us of eternal ami
:y, and to fettle the terms of a confcde
ration for extending the blelfings o
peace and liberty through the world
Thus united, the two kingdoms will b
omnipotent. They will soon draw inti
heir confederation Ho li. a n n, and othe
rountrics on this lide the globe, am
:he United States of America on tlv
ither ; and, when alarms of war come.'
:hey will be able to lay to contendin:
rations, peace, and there will b.
peace.
I have therefore thought, that i
â vould be worthy of this reipectabl
ompany on this moil animating anc
oyous occasion, to express its wilhe
jf success to the proposal I have men
ioned, by drinking the following toast
An alliance between FRANCE an<
SREAT-BRITAIN, for perpetuatin:
icace, and making the world happy.
GALLIPOLIS.
The settlers of Gallipolis are in greet
'topes of succeeding in making wine,ânot o
â xotic grapes, but by cultivating the wild A
merican grape. A singular circumftanc
vave rife to thtfe hopes. In the Ohio, im
mediately opposite to Gallipolis, is a sand
[/land remarkable for the goodness oj the wiL
Jrape, produced on it. They are juicy, th
fhin.rn.uch thinner and floneJmaller than th
grapes of the fame kind in the other parts o
the country. This difference is attributed (
the effects of the ice in winter, which, zoh:n
the river rises, sweeps over the island ani
trims the vines. This coarse dressing, tho
it happens in an unfavorable fcafon of th,
year, together with the exposed situation c
the island to the direct rays of the fun, i.
conceived to be the re of on of the fuperioritj
Â°t the grapes in this fmallfpot. Very pa
latabk wine has already been made of thef
grapes, and when the hint is improved upon,
and a regular course of culturebefiowed upoi,
our native vine (which is the determinatioi,
of our settlers to attempt J Scioto wine, whi
knows, may perhaps, one day supplant tht
Madeira on our tables.
