cf the Miliary ejabfijhintnt.
MR. STEELE, agreeably to notice,
cr.lled up his motion, which is in
the following wordsÃefolded, that e
committee be appointed tu prepare and
bring in a bill, to reduce the military
eftabliftiment of the United States to
regiments or corps confitting each
of noncomir.ifiioned officers, pri
vate*, and musicians, with such proporti
on of commifiioned officers, as the Presi
dent may think proper to continue in ser
vice ; and to repeal so much of an ast pas

" provifmu ioV the protection ofthe fron
" tiers of the United States." as may
contravene this intention."
Mr. Steele declared he did not rife to
fay much trti this motion. The opinions
of members mull be taade up from obser
vations on fails that have come withir
their own knowledge, therefore, what lit
could advance, he did not suppose, would
change heir opinions. The lioule is i:

guine/he said, as to expect, that the Fe
deral government would be exempt from
them. But when abnfes did creep in ts
the admiuiftnitian of a government, silence
he considered as criminal, and a quiet
aequiefcence woife:âa free people, ho v. -
ever, wtre incapable of feeing them with
outremonllrating, and the people of A
merica possessed enough of the true spirit
of freemen, n6t to fuffer the progress of i
ruinous war system, or to bear the burder
imposed upon them to support expensive
projefts'of ambition without remonftra
ting. The people of the United Statei
are peaceful, they are attached from edu
cation and habit to regularity and peace
he wa9 sorry, he said, that part of ou
adrtiinifttation did not appear to be gui
ded by the fame spirit. Chimerical pro
jests had been set on foot without regarc
to the public opinion ; âarmies had beer
raised ;md maintained without affording
protection to the frontiers, and the ex
pence of this system had justly roused tin
indignation of our citizens. The mottc
of a republic (hould be, 'Economy anc
peace.' With these cardinal qualities
any nation may be happy, without then
no government can be tolerable. H<

individual ftatc, ani to compare that ex
pence with what has already been incur
red under the present system: It would
be difficult,he said, to point out and jufti
fy the causes of their material difference.
There was no good rcafon why so ex pen -
five a system as that now pursued Ihoujd
be ncceffary; and if the expences of the
war department could not be reduced,
the country, he conceived would not cxe
able to bear them.
His motion was intended, and his mo
tives in making it, were, to aftord effec
tual protection to the frontier, to dimi
nish the expence at present incurred for
that objea, and apply the savings to the
redu&ion of the public debt. He wa
firmly of opinion that if an economical
system was pursued, the dcfence of the
frontiers could be effected and a finking
fund eftablilhed that would begin to ope
rate four or five years sooner than was at
present contemplated by the secretary of
the tieafury, and that without any addi
tional tax. He could not approve of
any finking fund that mull be entirely
supported by new taxes, âmuch lrfs of
one which wats to depeud solely on loans.
He next turned to the mode of war
fare adopted since the establishment of
the federal government against the Indi
ans The history of the frontier from
Braddafck's defeat to the present day am
ply proved, that regular armies are im
proper for that kind of war. Ifthis his
tory had been attended to and the fate
of that commander had been considered
and placed to its true cause, three milli
ons of dollars and many valuable lives
might have been laved to the United
States. A regular army is an expensive
machine, and in its operations unweildy
and tardy, composed of men without the
ueceffary enterprize, constitution and acti
vity to combat a savage foe, accullomed
to fatigue and fighting for their all.
He quoted a passage from a communi
cation fiom the secretary of war himfelf
to the house, to (hew the opinion he en
tertained df the enemy. Their fubtilty
and activity, and our ignorance of the
rountry and mode of warfare. The house
he said, had not fufficiently attended to
the inadequatenefs ofregular armies in op
position to such an enemy, as demonllra
ted by expeiience, and that pernicious
facility of borrowing had induced to
pass v.ith two little difficulty appropria
tion on appropriation, *o pursue it.
If taxes had been demanded to makethefe
provilions perhaps the legifiature, he fug-
would have been more caution!
how they proceeded.
He again adverted to the mode of war
tare which regular armies necessitated ; â
jne expedit on can only fce effeÂ£leu in ont
year, and indeed, it had been found, that
ven one could not be accompliftied tlii;
year, b'.it one expedition could afford nr
.-ffettlial prote&ion to the frontier. Be
ides the motions of a regular army are ea
â¢ly watched and known, âIndians well
knowing when to expeÂ£t their encmyj
will collect in full force, and beat us a;
i'liey have done, and will do again, if the
Tame system is pursued.
He wis of opinion that if such a mea
lure would be admiflible on principles ol
benevolence and policy, that the Incian
war might be farmed to the state of Ken
tucky, and completely terminated, for ont
half of the sum now about to be appro
priated to suppOrt the present futile fyf
tem. He appealed for the julhce of the
position to those gentlemen acquainted
with thefeeiiiigs and habits of the people
of that (late.
Upon thefuccefs of his motion he con
ceived the success of the war depended.
Regular troops could never fight in the
woods. If the system is not changed the
war will be a seven or a ten years' war.
Active and entsrprifing frontier militl.i
alone were equal to oppofwg Indians.
SATURDAY, January 5, 1793.
In bis motion, as offered, there was, he
Taid, a blank for the number of regiments
to remain on foot. He should propose,
at a proper time, he intimated, to till this
blank up with two, which would give
2no private;, regulars, quite enough,
even if the Prcfident should think, it neces
sary to garrison all the polls which have
been elllblifiied for the proiedtion of the
frontiers.
He enumerated these pods as follows :
Fayette, Hamilton, Stubcn, Knox.
Tammany", Teltair, Harmar, l ranklin.
Jefferfon, St. Clair, Marietta, Malfai.hu
setts, Matthews and Knoxville.
Abandoning the fvltem of active expe
ditions by regu ar troops and giving tc
each of these an equal of the 2120
men, compofi, 1 the two regiatients, each
poU would be prate&eti h-j ; ? privates.
This number vould be iulficienl
und greater tha 1 the how efend : g fomt
of those poll- 1 ' ' l - s.hcd it left dif
cretiouary with t.:. i'reudent to distri
bute them.
He ftr ed, that the only objection ol
the fecicUry at wax even to employing
the militia in this war, wa3 the expence.
He withed to refute that objedtiou and
went into a reasoning of some length on
the fnbjeft. Regular troops, when inlif
ted must be paid, cloathed, See during
the whole time of tfieir enlistment, whe
ther in a&ual service or not ; the militia,
tho' more expensive while on foot, yet be
ing on the spot, executing an expedition
in forty or fifty days, then returning to
their homes and immediately on their re
turn being out of pay, would be found
In tfce uwi"ttv.ich less expenfrve as well as
much more effe&ual. Five expeditions,
he computed, could be made in eack year,
bv a militia on or near the frontier, and
50,000 dollars he set down as fafikicnt to
pay the expence of cach of these expedi
tions.
To give an idea of the expence of re
gular troops and to shew the alarming
progrefi of expence on this score since tht
establishment of the new government, lit
gave the following items from appropria
tion laws oast and repoits of estimates o!

The provision for the last mentionec
department, he conceived, bore a very lu
dicrous appearancc. He considered it as
absurd to attempt fighting Indians wal
artillery. Not all the artillery of Europt
would avail againlt such a foe. He coi/K

He next turned to the pay, subsistence
and cloatliing of the troops. He premi
sed on this head, that it was well worth
conlidering, whether those articles kept
up an exadl proportion with the encreafe
of the troops, in the itemshe (liould give:
they certainly should, he conccived. If
the proportion of the sums latterly appro
priated according to estimates for thcfe
articles proved greater, there mud be, he
contended, abiife somewhere, and it cer
tainly is the duty of the Houfeof Repre
sentatives to examine where the blame
lies.

were under pay than the public lervice

nvt Ptigation.
lie proceeded to show what would be
!aved to the United States by a change
:>f fyltem. He (hewed by a quotation
"rom a report of the secretary of the trea
sury, ihat it was the opinion of that of!iÂ»
:er, that the current service of the en!u
injr year would probably require the
whole of the revenue ; but that he con.
templates a valuable furplfis for the re
demption of the debt, should a termina
tion be put to the Indian war. He made
[bine observations 011 the importance of
redeeming the public debt, as speedily
as pofllble, and complimented the secreta
ry of the treasury, in refpett to the dispo
sition he had shewn on thk fubje<S.
He was of opinion, that with peace and
Economy the resources of the country
would be fufficient to accomplish its total
redemption in ten years, by purchases
and regular inltalment payments âUnder
the present fyflem of warfare, a begin
ning cannot be made without levying, a
new tax, and a new tax cannot be gran
led, until tie ..bufes of the war depart
ment areconlidered and corrected .
He proceeded to (hew the economical
effeÂ£l of the redu&ion he proposed 011 onr
finances, by comparing the appropriation
of' 92 with the cflimate for 1793, for

The army under General Clairfayt have
paid dear for their attempts against France.
These troops have undergone the greatest
possible distress : they were 4 days with
out eatingâat last they killed and eat their
horfeu, and if a truce had not been made,
they mult all have surrendered; out of
6000 cavalry, which composed this army,
not above 400 will return; the relt are all
either killed, taken, or the horses eaten I
The remains of General Clairfayt'i army
have already pafled the French frontier.
Hague, October j6. The various fuc
cell'es of the French in Germany and Sa
voy, occasion a good deal of coniternation
in this country, anil government is afraid,
left patriotism Ihoukl again rear its head.
Dumourier's threat of taking up his win
ter quarters at Brufl'eb, occalions a prodi
gious alarm, becaufc the people here well
know that it would be only a step to pro
ceed thence to Holland. Government
conlequently pursue vigorous ineafures a -
giinft all thole who are suspected of favor
ing patriotic'ideas, and the States of Hol
land have lately ifiued an order on this
subject.
Brujfels, Oct. 17. We hear from the
provinces of Nanuir and Luxemburgh,
that the army of their royal highnefies
Monsieur and the duke d'Artois, is dis
banded, as well a's that under the com
mand of the duke de Bourbonâthe indi
viduals of which these armies were com
posed are in the greatest distress, wander
ing ind dispersed, without knowing where
to go, or what is to become of them; ma
ny without money; others felling their
horses, watches,and even their clothes. We
have seen some ofthera with no other cove
riagthan a blanket. A great many have got
only the iiiirt upon then; backs, and are
wading through thick and thin with half a
pair of ihoes. All these poor unfortunate
men have got their discharges in their
pockets, and anxiously delire to return to
their native country. It is to be hoped
that the French will shew themselves a ge
nerous nation in this instance ; and that
their humanity will lead them to forgive a
suppliant enemy.
Lijle, Oft. to. The fire of the enemy
ceased on the morning of the 6th, but they
did not abandon the villages of Fives, He
lemmes, Anappe, and other places in the
neighbourhood till the Bth.
They began their entrenchments ou
Tuesday, Sept. 25. Nothing could be
more beautiful or better disposed than
their works, and every one who has seen
them is astonished that they were able to
form them in so Ihort a space of time.â
The batteries rose one above another in
gradation, at the diflance of 100 paces from
each other, and they were so strong, that
15,000 men could uot have dislodged the
Auftrians. The loss which they hare oc
casioned to this city is estimated at fix mil
lions of livres.
Vienna, Oft. 6. The police of Vienna
redoubles its utmost attention to watch
foreigners as well as the fubjefts of the
Emperor, who may be infected with the
spirit of liberty.
According to the observations which
have been some time making, it has been
discovered, that those citizens whose at
tachment to the country was molt depend
ed upon, are the declared enemies of mo
narchical government, and have every
where endeavoured to make proselytes to
this opinion. It is found that persons of
all clafl'es and conditions are in these clubs ;i
it is feared therefore, that the tempest,
which must burst upon them, will be the
more dreadful.
Rome, Sept. 29. In this place, the
friends of the French are more numerous
than can be imagined, and the people want
nothing but a leader to crush the Papal
authority, and rescue themselves from fu
perltition and oppreflion.
Four thousand men were last week rai
sed, and ordered to the banks of the Ty
ber. They desired to know for what pur
pore they were embodied, but their requi
lition was denied. However, having come
to the knowledge that they were to em
bark for the purpose of alfifting the Auftri
ansto fight against the liberties of France,
these citizen ioldiers to a man laid down
their arms, and fold their regimentals to
the Jews.
The status of St. Peter, in St. Peter's
church,has been ftript of the gorgeous and
codly apparel, in which the Saint is annu
ally drefled, in compliment to the birth
day of his holiness the Pope. He now ap
pears in deep mourning, lamenting the
misfortunes of Louis ! âThe Pope and his
Cardinals have put on sack-cloth and a(h
es, ami the statue of Pafquin is covered
daily with satirical poems against his holi
ness and his friends, which iu days of yore
would have been by the ignorant pronoun
cedâblasphemous!
His holiness, the Pope, has issued abun
dance of plenary indulgences, and promi
lirtg eternal liappinefs, to ail those who
{hall be killed in fighting against the re
public of France.
Londonderry, Oft. 30. The following
is a brief lketch of the present posture of
affairs on the continent :âA continuation
of the success of the French arms in Pied
mont, Savoy, and SwiflerlandâThe Prus
sians evacuate Verdun by capitulation, and
are quitting the French territory totally ;
it is generally thought, that the king of
Prufiia has made a separate peace for him
felf, leaving the Auflrians to fhift for
themselvesâThe king of Spain has given

symptoms of discontent and revolt among
the people in the Netherlands, Germany

For the National Gazette.
To the Noblesse and Courtiers of
the United States-
W ANTED against the 2 if! of Februa
ry, a person who is well skilled in the trade
of verlifying, and who is willing to offer up
his talents to government as a Poet Lau
reat. As this is somewhat of a new trade
in the United States, and the person offer
ing himfelf may be aukward in the duties
which he is called to perform, it is intend
ed to write to the poet laureat of his Bri
tannic majelly for a few lessons. One
thing, however, will be certainly required,
a dexterity in compoling birth-day odes,
soaring above this clod for models for the
charaflers laureated. To compare an of
ficer of government to any thing on this
earth, would be an anti-hyperbole, unfuit
ed to the majesty of the fubjeft. It will
not be mal-apropos for the poet, in order
to render himfelf the more acceptable, to
have an intimate knowledge of the causes
of decline of all the republics which have
preceded us, that he may celebrate those
causes as favorable to American prosperi
ty. The ignorance of Americans will
render this tale highly pleasingâTo give a
more perfect accommodation to this almost
new appointment, certain monarchical
prettiucjfes must be highly extolled, such as
levees, drawing-rooms, /lately nods in/lead
ofjhaking hands, titles of office, feclufton
\ from the people,&c. It may be needless to
mentioncertain other trifling collateral du
ties, but that the poet may be acquainted
with the whole circle of requisites, it may
not be amiss to hint, that occafioual strokes
of ridicule at equality ; the absurdity that
the vulgar, namely, the people, should pre
sume to think and judge for themselves ; 1
the great benefit of rank and distinction ;
the abomination of equality fnppofing that
the officers of government ought to level
themselves with the people, by viliting;
them, inviting them to their tables, &c.
may be introduced by way of episode to
the poem. It is a wretched and mad opi
nion that some high flying republicans
maintain, that officers of government
ought to deport themselves as the equals (
of the people: it is founded in human na
ture, that when men are exalted above
their fellows, they should feel a conse
quence, exercise an insolence, and observe
a stately superiority over those who have
advanced them ; for by equalizing them
selves with the inobocracy, they diminish
that reverence andJubmijjion, which ought
neceflarily to be annexed to every impor
tant office. The majesty of the people is a
ridiculous solecismâit ought to be the
jefty of the officers of government, " stuck
o'er with titles and hung round witfi
firings." As theobjefts are Iketched which
are to engage the attention of the poet, it
only remains to mention, that the perfoti
who can render this essential service wifi
be well provided for by government either
at home or abroad. Dec. 31.

Mr. Dunlap,
HAPPENING to be at theHoufe ofÃepre
fegxatives the other day, when the bill was
debated, for taking the money appropria
ted to the French debt, and applying it to
the bank ; and the motion for ltriking out
t.Vvo million and putting in 200,000, the ac
tual sum due the bank, was loit by the vote
of the Chair, I could not but clearly fee
the force of what has been offn said, re
fpeftingthe tendency of the bank to influ
ence the government, and the opportunity
the members of the bank, being also mem
bers of the government, would have to
forward the interest (including theirovvn)
of that powerful inflitution. For it was
clear on that occasion (and may be the
lame on all fuch-like occasions) that if the
members of the bank (who were doubtless
coring in a matter of their own interest)
had not voted, or if they had been divided
in their votes as much as other uninterest
ed members, that the question would have
jeen very otherwise decided. This ap
pears to me a mod serious matter, and that
-alls loudly on the public attention. The
deaol changing any appropriations, strikes
iifagreeably ; but to take money intend
ed for our allies, who lent us in our day
of trialâ : at the crilis when the fate of their
awn glorious cause of liberty is depending,
ivas horrible to the feelings of an Ameri
can heart; and I do not believe would
lave been thought of for any other pur-
Jose (fhorr of felf-prefervation) otherthan
:o serve the bank ; and therefore, it de
nonftrates the mighty and truly-alarming
' "fluent e the bank has already got over

A correspondent observes, that it would
feetn bad policy to reduce the present ar
my establishment, before the concluiion of
something like a firm and general peace
with the Indians. Disarming any part of
our war eftabliihment before that period
will leave us at the mercy of the savages,
to fettle matters upon their own termsâ
It has always been a European maxim,
to make peace with the jxvori in your hand.
âOur frontier is becoming so thickly fet
tled that the Indians now find it eafierto
get a living by plunder than by hunting ;
and they will not fail to prefer the firlt of
these modes, if they are not restrained by
a certainty of puoilhinent from a iuperior
force.

' " THE crops of grain have proved
much less than was expected in all the
southern departments of France, and con

of grain to come as far as this, and go even
to America in order to buy and procure
supplies of wlieat and flour, but the uncer

going on to America. We shall also want

ExtraS if a letter from Mr. Vanderhorft,
consul of the United States at Brijiol, to,
the Secretary of State, dated Otlober 10.
A very uncommon wet harveit-time
here, has done muc|i injury to the crops of
grain, which were before very promiiing ;
corn in eonfequence has confulerably ad
vanced in price, and it is expected, will
(till be higher, so that there is at present,
no doubt aipong our merchants in this
place, but the ports of this kingdom, Will
in the course of next month, be opened,
for the admission of foreign grain of ail

that many of them have already sent large
orders abroad for the purchaling of corn.
The triumph of Liberty is now,in a great
measure, complete. The invaders oi
France are every where retreating before
the viÂ£torious armies of that republic. Il
is no longer in the power of Europe tc
bring about a counter-revolution. We
behold the French nation aflame a firn:
character and republican manners. We
fee order return, and diffufe the spirit oi
liberty; their resources encreafe, and'theii
armies are tenaciousof difciplint'. Unanimi
ty and connection mark their measures ol
defence ; and the confidence of the whole
people in the National Convention, give:
energy to their power, and success to their
operations. Had a king formed no part
of their original conllitution, it may now
be discovered, that the functions of its of
fices would never have been perverted.â
Even the friends of monarchy are now
convinced, that the second revolution was
unavoidable, and that there was no alter
native on the 10th of August between free
dom and slavery.

The circuit court of the United State:
was opened here on the 30th of November
and continued open train day to day until
Tuefdaythe tith inft. when it was ad
journed by the diftrift judge until the ill
of June next :âNo business of any kinc
was done, owing to the absence oi the cir
cuit or aflbciate justicesâThe jurors at
tended with great punctuality and patience
the whole time, although this is a very bu
sy and important season with the plantei
and farmer. Mr. Johniton, one of the as
sociate justices, had held thecourts inSouth-
Carolina and Georgia, and was taken ill al
Augulta, and his letter, authorizing the ad
journment of the court, was not receiver
until Monday the 10th. Several pirate;
have been for many months confined here
in a loathsome dungeon, praying for their
execution as a tender mercy compared with
their present confinement âand two per
sons, who were only so unfortunate as tc
be the witnesses of their crimes, not being
able to give security for their appearance,
are confined in a manner not much more
comfortable. Tiiefe poor wretches are
now doomed to fuffer the inclemencies oi
the winter in a iituation already shocking
to humanity. The accidental interrup
tions of the federal courts iince their insti
tution in this slate, and the entire loss ol
this term, have brought them into some
disrepute, both with the suitors and the
people. The judicial fyllem was so de
fective, both in point of principle and ar
rangement, and so aukward and unwieldy
in its operation, that the second feffiun oi
Congress saw the neceflity of an entire al
teration ; they modestly avoided the
work themselves, as if it had been a tail'
beyond their strength, notwithilanding the
number of profefliotial gentlemen in both
houses, and ordered the attorney-general,
in the Gongreffional style, a fort of Secre
tary of the law department; to report tnt
necelfary amendments ; âan elaborate fo
lio pamphlet appeared at the next feflion.
and thepeople exported the business would
have been immediately taken up.but anothei
of their fecretanes made a report on a pro

and obscurity, the report of the secretary

forgotten and neglected.

It is well known, t! ,t while the consti
tution was in agitation, there were at lead
feven-eighlhs iof the v. oie mass of thÂ«
people opposed to it. It is well known,
that many ge Jileir.en 'of uniform princi

the adoption, in its plefent form, withoul
tirlr pruning those excrefcenets, which, al
a future period, when the principles oi
freedom ur.-. ' be io ve as at pre-
Pent : when the lire' of liberty may he i
little deadened, iii endanger the happi
ness, if not defti Oy the ir.depr idence oi
the country. It is well known, that the
acceptance of it, was effected by fraud
lifiiinulation, artifice and intrigue, if nol
t>y corruption. It is well known, thatthe
i trge minorities of the several conventi
ons, and die larger majorities of the peo
ple abroad, submitted, in the decision o:
the conventions, to that maxim in poli
tics' 'â 'â that the majority (hould govern?
that they acquiesced in this nominal, ima
ginary majority, with a magnanimity and
jenerofity, that did infinite honor to this
enlightened nation. It is well known, that

i difference in opinions, upon one e>f the
jreateftcjtrefHons, that almost ever agita

ivere in general, as well convinced of the
leceflity of a firm energetic system of go

out they could not be convinced of the
neceflity of the violent haste, with whict
this form was obtruded on the people, foi
the gratification of the ambition and ava

is well known, that the oppolers of the a
ttoption of the new government (unlef
jrevioufly amended) have been as gooe
citizens, and would go as far to fuppor
the system, as any of its most zealous ad

tience is nearly exhaufled. They have hi
therto considered it as the ebullition o:

lave seen themselves studiously exclude c
from any places of honor or emolument.
They have seen that the glorious boast o:

not applicable to them ; and I believe theii

Gen. Hull, as officers. A number tif out

I RECEIVED yofor favor of the sth in

jut on a second reading, I beg leave to in
orm you, that I lament your senior off
ers declining to colne forward in behalf
>f those of inferior rank and the soldiery,
â¢vho have not ability to come forward for
hemfelves.
Notwithstanding those gentlemen have
>een so fortunate as to retain their own
.ertificates, and perhaps to make an addi

itt'cct their pwrchafes, but do justice to their
>rivate stock.
With regard to your members, Captain
Dayton was not inCongrefs when thefund
ng law palled, and cart his bread upon the
A'aters with other speculatorsâBut Mr.
3oudinot was in Congress, and having a
arge sum in fi&itious certificates, had an
jpportunity to fund a large sum of debt
"or afmall sum in specie.
The representatives from the Eaft3rn
States are endeavoring to persuade the a
sents that are here, that they will fee the
"allacy of tl.eir application; for the repre
entatlve oE the dates of Virginia and
Georgia do not mean, by advocating the
;aufe of the army, that they (hould receive
any payments, but to bring on a divi(ion t
n hopes to overthrow the government.
This would be an unpopular doctrine in
Virginia, as they have the fulleft confidence
n the justice and ability of their mem
bers.
The farmers in the southern states con
reive they have been swindled out of their
certificates by the New-England specu
lators.âââThis belief has been corro
borated on the information of a letter front
Mr. Amafa Learned, a member from Con

to Mr. Jedidiah Leeds, of Richmond,, loÂ»
liciting him to be an agent in Virginia (ei*
:her on commiffions,or as a partner) for the
jurpofe of purchasing the deferred and

:ould bepurchafed at a low rate, and that
the Secretary of the Treasury was bringing
Forward a plan to make the whole debt at
5 per cent, stock, which was then felling at
>5 {hillings in the pound. But Mr. Leeds
loubted the propriety of the transaction,
ind declined the concern.
At present I can form no conjeÂ£ture of
the sequelâCol. Hamilton, notwithstand

and was indulged two years previous
Co the treaty of peace, to be absent or* his

Jan. 5.THIRD DECLARATION of the
D uke of Brunswick,
[Read to the French National Contention
by M. Briflot.]
WHEN their majesties the Empe
ror and the King of Pruflia, in
confiding to me the command of the
armies which these two allied sovereigns
have caused to march into FVance, made
me the organ of their intentions, set forth
in the two declarations of the 25th and
27th of July 1792, their majesties were
far from conceiving the possibility of those
fcerres of horrcr, which preceded and
brought on the imprifohmcnt of their ma
jesties, the king and queen of France, and
the royal family. [?*&* gave rife to fomt
murmurs. ]
[M. Briflot here observed, that the on
ly answer he fliould make to this manifef
to, was that General Dumourier had ii
printed and dilbributed in his army ; the
good effe&s of which were found in the
increased courage and provoked indignati
on of tbe soldiers. He proceeded in the
reading of it.]
Such atrocious aÂ£h, of which nations ir
the least degree civilized have not yel
(hewn an example, were nevertheless noi
the extreme bounds which the audacity o
certain factious men, who had contrived tt
render the people of Paris the blind in
ftruments of their will, had set to thei
guilty ambition.
The fuppreflion of all the king's func
tions, which had been reserved to him bj
that very constitution, which had been f<
long cried up as the vow of the whole na
tion, was thelafl crime of the national as
fembly, which has brought upon Franci
the two dreadful scourges of war and an
archy. [ Frejh murmurs J
[M. Briflotâl request silence, if it b<
only thro' pity.]
To perpetuate these evils, there re
mained but one Hep to be taken, whicl
could be dilated only by that mad spirit
the fatal fore-runner of the fail of empires
which has seized uponthofe men whodif
tinguilh themselves by the life of deputiei
Of the nation, chosen to confiim its right;
and happiness, upon the molt fubftantia
basis. The firft decree which they paflec
in their aflembly, was the abolition ef roy
alty in France ; and the senseless acclama
tion of a small number of individuals, o
whom even several were ttrangers, claim
ed the right of overthrowing the judgment
of fourteen generations, who have fillet
the fourteen centuries of the existence o:
the French monarchy.
This proceeding at which the enemiei
of France alone (hould rejoice, if they fup
â pofed that it could have a lading effect, 1:
in diredl opposition to the firm resolution
which their m.-jefties the emperor and the
king of Prufiia have taken, and frotr
which those two allied sovereigns will ne-
Ver depart, to restore to his molt Chrilliar
majefly, his liberty, fafety, and royal dig.
nity, or to wreak a just and lignal ven
geance on those who (hall dare any longei
to violate or infringe upon them.
For these reasons, the under-signed de
clares to the French nation in general, and
to each particular individual, that theii
majellies the emperor and the king ol
Pruflia, invariably attached to the princi
pie of not meddling in the interior go
vernment of France (a peal of laughter,
persist nevertheless to require, that his moll
Chrillian majefly, together with all the
royal family, (hall be immediately set al
liberty by those who presume to keef
them imprisoned. Their m<ijeflie3 also in
fill, that the royal dignity in France fhal
be, without delay, re eflabliflied in the
perlon of Louis the XVlth. and his fuc
ceflors :'(another and louder burjl of laughâ 
ter) Anel furl her, that this royal dignity
shall be secured from any such affront ir
future.
If the French nation has not entirely
loft fight of its true interests, and if, free
in its resolutions, it is desirous of putting
a stop quickly to all the calamities of a
war, which exposes so many provinces tc
all the evils attendant upon the march oi
an army, it will not elelay an instant in de
claring its opinion in favor of the peremp
tory demands which I make in the name
of their majellies the emperor and the
king of Pruilia; and which, in cafe of a
refufal, will inevitably draw down upon
this kingdom, hitherto so flourilhing, new
and rooie terrible disasters.
The part which the French nation may
take, in consequence of this declaration,
will either extinguifti or perpetuate the
Fatal effects of a calamitous war, by remo
ving, in the suppression of royalty, the
means of rc-eftablifhing and keeping up
the ancient connexion between France and
the powers of Europe ; or may open the
way by negociation, to the restoration oi
peace, order, and tranquility, which those
who call themfelve3 the depositaries of the
hational will, are the mod interested tc
render as prompt as it Is necefiary to the
kingdom.

EXTRACT.
\_From the Federal Gazette.]
That the arms of republican France
" Ihould have been so soon, and so com.
pietely fuccefsful, is truly aftonilhing :
and while it affords a reasonable profpeil
of a happy iflue to the revolution, it mull
fill the mind of every tl.inking creature
with adoration for that Being, to whoir
alone such signal fuccelTes can be afcri
bed.
I hat the fuccefsof the French revolt
tion, is of infinite consequence to the peact
and happiness of the United States, nc
person who has fcen the combination ir
favor of monarchical principles amongfl
us will doubt. Had monarchy, or in othe
words, had tyranny prevailed over thi
Rights of Man in France, the advocate
for this exccrated system would have be
come bold and open. But thanks to ou
kinder liars, the reign of kings and tyrant:
is drawing to an endâand that of rcafor
and nature is rapidly advancing !
It is worthy of remark, that from th<
ever to be remembered 10th of August
l'rench affairs have changed their afpedl
having on that glorious day rid themfelve:
of the bauble of royalty, and totally de
prived their former tyrant of the power o
doing mifchief, from that moment the na
tion began to feel her power; from thai
moment they had confidence in their ge
nerals; their armies became disciplined
system took place ; plans were concerted
and unlike what had happened before ;
those plans have been executed.
The monarchy men amongst us, whicl
by the bye, amongst what are culled tin
higher circles, aie not a few, will now, it is
to be hoped, be allured that their fair)
profpe&s are at an end ; that the fuccef
of republican principles in France, has
determined the queltion against them.â
It is hoped that they will submit with 1
good grace to their disappointment, ant!
that they will be convinced, that howevei
" unfit the people are togovern themselves,'
they are resolved to make the attempt,
and to keep the thing at trial a few year:
longer.
i hat a very confiderablc majority of the
people of the United States think with me,
as to the importance of the late fuccelfe:
of out friends in France, is demonftratec
by the eagerness with which the informa>
is fought for, and the joy exprefTed from
every quarterâand with but a few excep.
tions from the "better kind"of people,maj
be said to be universal. Impressed wit!
this idea, 1 would beg leave to alk, if il
would not be right and proper for the ci
tizens of the United States, to express it
some public manner, their sentiments, upor
the retreat of the agent of the despots frorr
the French Republic, and the accom
panying fuccelTes of that magnanimous peo
pie. Perhaps from the etiquette of nationa!
policy, it may not be thought proper foi
:he government to order, or direst an)
lemonftrations of joy : But if the REAL
SOVEREIGNS of the United States
he MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE
[hould think proper to celebrate so great
m event, I doubt not but it would be
highly acceptable to the friends of equality,
not only in France but all over the world,
and would be considered as a new a/Tur
ance that such are the principles of the
citizens of the United States of America. 1
