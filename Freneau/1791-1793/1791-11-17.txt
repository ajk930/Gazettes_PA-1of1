ON THE ESTABLISHMENT OF
AMI N T
IN THE UNITED STATES.
By THOMAS PAINE.
THE price of the machinery and the
exoence of labour are reServed tc
the conciufion. I proceed therefore tc
consider the Metals and the means o:
procuring them.
I begin with Copper. âThis Met.,
is of too little value and of too much
bulk, to anfvver the purposes of coin ti
any great extent: About ten or twenty
thou'fand dollars worth of copper con
is, 1 believe, as much as can be circu
lated in America.
Copper may be had in America
theaoer than in any other "part ot the
world, and in greater quantities thai;
are neceflary for coining. I his cop
per comes from the vVelt-Indies, it is
the old boilers stills, and other utensils
which being worn out, the Planter:
have no uSe for the old copper. They
have not, as I am informed, the mean;
ofmelting it up, or do not pive them
selves thetrouble to do it, beiides w;ucli
there is a duty of 3d sterling per lb. 011
landing it in England.
Considerable quantities of this cop
per have, since the war, been bought lr
New-York, for 6d. per lb. York cur
rency ; but supposing ten pounds of 11
be bought for one dollar, it will conle
quently follow that ten pound weigh,
of copper is only equal to about on<
ounce weight of Silver ; if therefor,
one dollar worth of copper was to b<
divided into a hundred parts or cents,
each cent wculu be i>hdvs the wcigiii
and size of a silver dollar. Two oppo
site difficulties, therefore, preSent them
selves with refpea to a copper coinage :
the one is, that to give the coins, 01
cents, the intrinsic value they ought to
have by weight, they will be too heavy
and bulky for the use they are intended
for ; the other is, that to make them
light enough to be convenient, they
will not have intrinsic value enough tc
pass, any more than half dollars woulc
pass for dollars.
The proportionate or relative value
of silver to gold, is about 16 to one
that is, 16 ounces of Silver is about the
value of one ounce of gold, but the re
lative value of copper to silver, is frorr
lEOto 140 to 1. which makes them toe
remote to represent each other in the
ihape of coin convenient for the pocket.
Nobody would think of carrying brats
pound weights about him for coin, ye)
he must carry copper in that propor
tion.
The metal convenient for a coin un
der the silver coin, should not dihci
more in its value from silver than filvei
does from goldâand if it differed ftil
less it would be better : but as the rela
tive values now fund, the diifercnce
encreafes where convenience require,
it should dccreafe. Bnt as no such .
metal, which convenience requires, ex
ills naturally, the question is whethei
it will anlwer to produce it by compo
sition.
Of compositions, three methods pre
sent themselvesâ lft. Mixing silver ane
coppcr in fufionâ2d. Plating the cop
per with silverâ3d. Plugging the cop
per with silver. But against all thek
there are very capital objeftiono
Wherever there is ct want of fatisitic
tion there must necessarily be a want oi
confidence ; and this must always take
place in all compounded metals. There
1S alio a decrease in the intrinsic va
lue of metals when compounded ; one
Shilling worth of silver compounded
with one Shilling worth of copper, the
compofiticn is not worth two {hillings,
or what the metals were worth ,before
they were compounded, because they
must again be Separated to acquire theii
utmost value. ; nd this only can be done
By PHILIP FRENEAU.
r l HURS DA Y, November 17, 179*-
?.t a refiner's. It is not what the. coin
co'l to make, but what the coin is in
trinfi'cally worth when made ; that o.i
ly can give it currency in all cases.
Plugging copper with lilvei is the leail
detrimental to the intrinsic value of the
metals, because they are the eaueft fepa
rated ; but in all these cases the value oi
the silver put into the composition wil
be so predominant to the value of the
copper, that it will beratherabafe filvei
coin than a copper coin.
As therefore copper presents so man)
mcor.venienccs arising from its grea
bulk, and little value, and so small ar
ohjeft for establishing a mint (for peo
pie have learned the value of coppei
coin too well to take it as thev former!)
did) all the calculations for a mint muf
be made upon silver and gold, and what
ever may done in copper to be coniider
ed only as incidental.
It is i think pretty evident that cop
per has become a coin not from the wan
or scarcity of silver (because the value
of all the copper coin in any nation i:
but a trifle, and never considered ir
the estimation of national property) but
because silver does not admit of beini
divided and sub-divided down into fuel
small pieces as to contain only the value
of-a copper or a cent. It is this onl)
which has induced a recourse to cop
per.
In England, the lowefl silver coin i:
fix-pence, which is equal to twelve cop
pers, and therefore the resource to cop
perS for change, or for the purchase o
small articles under the value of fix
pence is frequently recurring ; but i
in America we were to coin iilver as lovi
as the twentieth part of a dollar, whicl
would be pieefcs of five cents, the occa
lion for coppers would be very mud
diminished, and such pieces would b<
nearly of the size of the French silver fu
lous. I think the policy is in favor o
keeping as much silver coin as we can ir
the country ; and this is one of my mo
tives for excluding copper as much a
pofiible.
Some denomination under the fiv
cent pieces would (till be necelfaryâ
but as the occasions would be diminish
ed, a small quantity would be fufficient
It is conveniince only that ought to b;
considered with refpeft to copper coin
age, and not money or riches. It wa:
going on this lalt idea instead of the sirs
one that entangled the former Congref
and the several States. They attemptec
to do what no othernation ever though
of doing, and which is impossible to dc
âthat of exalting copper into nationa
wealth. Nature .has fixed its boundary
and we must keep to it.
It is therefore something by whict
to divide the five cent silver pieces, tha
appears tome the only thing to be con
fidered with refpeft to a copper coin
age. This maybe done either by coin
ing copper cents of the size and jntrin
sic value they ought to be, which wil
prevent their being counterfeited, 01
depreciated, or to coin or stamp fmal
copper pieces, as a fort of treasury notes
or notes of the mint, of the nominal va
lueofone, two, and three cents, to be
exchanged, if any person chufes to ex
change them, at the treasury or the min
for silver. These will be more durable
,than paper tickets, and capable of beinj;
extende'd over the continent withoui
the danger of wearing out ; and people
will not compare the value of them b)
the metal they contain, but by the ob
ligation to exchange them for silver i:
required. To prevent their fceirfg coun
terfcited they should not be a tendei
for any thing above five Cents, ot
more than five in any one payment .
As they would be merely for the pur
pose of dividing the silver cents by, and
not for the purpose of supplying the
place of silver com in large quantities,
but the mint or the treasury should al
ways exchange them to any amount,
though die amount can never be much
at eny one time.
To give these rotes the opportunity
sfgetting into circulation no fader, nor
in greater quantities than the occalions
r or them require, the mint should not
ilTue them in payment, but have them
in readiness for merchants, fhop-keep
rrs, &e. to fetch away by tale in ex
rhange for silver or gold. This used tc
ae the way the copper coinage at the
:ower of London got into circulation
Every shop-keeper knew where to gc
to get ten or twenty shillings worth.
Congrcfs could fuflain no inconveni
:nce, nor run any risk in exchanging
hose pieces for iilver whenever thev
should be prcfented, because the value
of them in silver would be deposited
whtn they were ,fi rft taken away. The
difference between coining cents of
their full value by weight, which they
nuft have if they are to depend on
:heir own worth for a currency, and
:oif ing coppei notes, whose value is tc
iep<;nd upon their being exchangeable
for Silver at the mint, is, that the firfl
if these methods is more than double
the expcnce of the last, and the conve
nience to the public not so great, not
:he security so good. If twenty thou
sand dollars worth of nominal cents 01
notes were coined, the saving in meta'
and workmanflup would be upwards oi
ine-half, and Congress would have the
nominal value of them realilid in silver
This difference between the two me
thocis is equal to the firft year's expenct
in fcftabliming a mint. To confide]
copper only as change, or as a mediurr
Dy which to divid: the silver coin
md to permit it to comc out no faftei
than it shall be called for, will alway:
prevent inconvenience in the coppei
coinage. The contrast for ioo,coc
of coppsr coinage, is
I believe, ten times more than can b'
circulated, because it will only circu
late as change. Of the profits whicl
the contra&ors calculated upon, I fcn<

tions are at 6s the dollar. From this
may very easily be calculated the pro
fits which the co'ntra&ors expe&ed to
make upon Â£ 100,000. The cxpence
of the machinery is to be added, as I
have only Hated the manual expence
and materials.
Quitting this part of the fubjeft, I
come to make some considerations on
the silver coin.
Opportunities for procuring silver
and gold for coining do not present
themselves like those for copper ; but
they undoubtedly would prelent them
selves more frequently if a mint was
established. As every nation puts some
value upon its coin, the coin passes for
more than the metal is worthâif, there
fore, we are charged for the expence
of making Spanifli dollars, we had bet
tar make dollars for ourselves, provided
we can procure the silver in bars. But
until we have a.mint the importation of
silver will continue to be made in coin,
because what can a merchant do with
silver or gold in bars or ingots where
there is no mint.
Numb. 6.
It therefore rests to know whether
silver in bars or gold in ingots, or any
other way not coin, can be procured
cheapcr than in coin, and what the dif
ference is.
The most effe&ual method to acquire
this knowledge and to procure silver in
bars, is to c.'lablifh a mint, and to de
liver to every importer of bars, or other
nerfon, the nett produce in coin which
iiis bars shall produce.
The price of silver in bars at the bul
lion-office in the bank (London) is
t;f i 1-2âthe price of silver in new
Mexican dollars is af\ 1 1-2 âthe dif
ference is 2d. or the 27th part of a dol â¢
lur. It is hardly to be supposed that
we pay to the amount of this difference
at the Havannah or clfewhere in re
ceiving dollars instead of silver unma
nufactured into coinâif we do, we pay
ibove four times the price we can ma
lufadture the coin for ourielves, pro
vided we can procure the silver in that
proportion.
Twenty-five men will be able to com
plete 4.000 dollars per day from the
jars. A million of dollars, coin
id within the space of about a year
and a half, at one cent per dollar, will
pay all the exper.ee of labor, and the
cricc of machinery r.eceffiny for such
111 operation, after which the expence
per dollar will diminish, provided the
men are kept employed.
The following is given to me as a tole
rable proportionate ellimate of the ex
pence of coining copper,' silver and
Â»old, into cents, dollars an d half-joes ;
The labor ot 25 men will
:oin, pet day, about - - 10,000 coppers,
or 4,000 dollars,-
Or 2,803 half-joes.'â¢
Jsy this it apnears that the expence
of coining copper is aTj'ouf forty times
greater than that of filvei", and about
two hundred times greater than that of
gold. This furnifhes an additional
reason against copper coinage.
It may perhaps bs asked, that if the
importer of silver in bars is to receive
the exacl produce of his bars from the
mint, in coid, where will be the ad
vantage ? I answer, that the advantage
in the firft. inflance will be to the im
porter, becaule he gets more dollars for
his cargo than he would by receiving
dollars at the place of sale, and this is
his inducement to bring in bars. The
advantage in the lecond infl nice, is'to
the whole country, beeaufe it makes a
greater quantity of money than there
would be by importing the filtfer in
coin. If the difference is 1747 th in a
dollar, and bars can be procured in
stead of Spanifii dollars, the increase o!'
silver money in the country would be
as 112 is to 108.
There is another circumstance by
which money would increase in the
country if a mint were ellablifhed,
which is from the old silver plate
which is now sent to England, and it is
not improbable that lome old silver
plate might come from the Well-Indies.
But until there is a mint, we muff re
main ignorant of the refourcesby which
silver and gold are to bs obtained.
The whple apparatus of a mint
can be made in America. The only
thing neceflary to import wil! be a
Imall quantity of caft-fleel, which is
an article not made in America.
The following is a tolerable efli'mate
of the cxpence of as much machinery
as will be fufticient to begin with, as
it can occafionaliy be employed in gold,
silver, and copper,

Coining is a new b'.ifmefsln Americ.-y
rhofe who have j. ro'pofed cdntr?.Â£is,knew, eirtier of themf; Ives., or from thol*
who were to execute, what they were: doing
hut ihey supposed Congrefh to know nothing o
the mutter. Accident and a turn for mechanic
have thrown me into A knowledge of tiiet
plans, and the profits they expected to make.
Whenever CongVefs goes into this biifmefs i
will be bed to doit on their own account. Th<
experience will cost Something, but it will be
worth obtaining, arid the cheapest way of ob
tinning it. The faÂ£l is, that the American coin
eis can afford to manufaflure coppers and fenc
them to England cheaper than the English coin
â  : tan fend them to America. In England
copper is about lod or 101-2 sterling, per lb,
but o!d copper from the Wclt-tndies is not hall
that price. When copper coining firlt began in
the New-England dates, a person concerned in
that buliuefs has fmce told me, that he lent hi;
lon to the Well-Indies to fee after copper- âthai
in Ihe polfcition of one person, at Providence,
he found upwards of 53 tons, which was o'fered
him at the rate of for a dollar. When il
is confideied how great the exportation of cop
per utenlils mult annually be from England to
the islands, and that they are a drug after they
arc worn out, and have no market for the old
copper, but in America, it will be easy to ac
count for the plans, schemes and proposed con
tfe is thai have been lately set on foot.
In contemplating the extent of a mint, I
carry my mind a little further than the business
of coining. The introdu&ion of such a machi
nery as coining requires, will fervc to bring for
ward thole kind of arts which are contiefted with
it, such as making buttons of vauous kindi. 1 ht
mint may alio be anAlfayoffice for wrought plate,
which will conliderably contiibute towards de
fraying the expence of the mint, at lead it will
be a convenient appendix to itâand the having
an Alfav office will piomote the manufactory ot
plate in America, and prevent that branch of
hulinefs going to England, which it now does
from the want of that confidence in the puiity
ofthe metal which an A flay office would give.
An AlFav office is much wanted in Philadelphia.
Before the war a bill was biought into the as
sembly to appoint an Aflay matter, but the Gov
ernor refufed palling the bill unless he had the
;:j poiritment ot the person, and the matter
dropt, and has not been lince revived âBut it
ought to be connertcd with the mint, as the
jianriard for metals comes properly into that de
partinent. The silversmiths who bring the plate
pay something for the flamp, and the office, as
well for the (elleras the buyerisa veiy neccflary
one.

Monday, November 14.
Fetitions were laid before the House
from Thomas Baker, Daniel Forbes, Jo
nathan Guv, Adam Koch, John M. Kin

Alexander Low, and Isaac Robertfon,
praying compensations for wounds re
ceived, &c. in the army of the United
States, during the late w3r.
A petition of James Jackson, of Geor
gia, complaining of the undue elettion
and return of Anthony Wayne, one of
the Representatives in Congress from
said state, was read, as follows :
To the Hon. the Speaker and Members of the
House of Representatives of the United
States :
The petition of James Jackson, hum
bly sets forth,
THAT at the late election for mem
bers to represent the state of Georgia, in
your Hon. House for the prefcnt Gon
grefs, General Anthony Wayne and
vour Petitioner were candidates for the
Lower or Eastern Diftrift of the said
state : That an improper and undue re
turn has been made toyour House of the
said election : For, that the county elec
tion of Effingham, in favor of the said
Anthony Wayne, was illegal; there be
ing nine votes more than voters at the
fame, and two of the three perlons pre
siding thereat, not qualified magiflrates:
For that the return for the county of
Glynn, in favor ofyour petitioner, was
fupprelTed : For that a falle return was
made to the executive of the state, for
the county of Cambden, exceeding the
numbers of the legal poll, which a
mounted to twenty-five votes, by the
number of sixty-sour votes, all of which
were in favor of the laid Anthony
M'ayne, and added together with the
legal poll, far exceeds the whole number
of male free inhabitants, entitled to vote
therein : and for that an illegal or pre
tended poll was held, after the legal poll
was doled ; and on which illegal poll
the aforefaid falfe return was founded :
and th= legal return, after being duly
certified by the proper officers, was ei
ther suppressed or destroyed.
He therefore pravb your Hon. House
to poftponc any determination on the

According to the order of the day,
the House resolved itfelf into a commit

enumeration of the inhabitants of the
United States ; Mr. Muhlenberg in the

Mr. Findley and Mr. Giles urged a
/ariety of arguments in favor of a nu
merous representation, and concluded
with declaring for the ratio of one to
:hirty thousand.
Mr. Boudinot was against a very nu
merous representation , and moved't6
flrikei out of the bill the words " thirty
thousand," for the insertion of any
greater number that the House should
tix upon.
The committee rose, reported progress,
and alked leave to fit again.
Tuesday, Nov. 15.
The petition of John Davis was pre
sented and read, praying compensation
for services rendered as surgeon in the
army during the late war. Reforrec
for examination to the Secretary ai
War.
Mr. Sedgwick presented, from th'
rommittee appointed, a bill reipetlini
fugitives from juflicc, and from th
ervice of matters ; which being twic
read, was committed to a committee c
:he whole house on Friday next.
The house again resolved itfelf into

if enumeration, Mr. Muhlenberg ii
he chairâMotion before the house tha
he ratio of representation Ihould be on
or every thirty thousand inhabitants
.vith an amendment to flrike out th
ivords thirty thousand.
Mr. Page was for having the quel
ion decided by a general convention
ailed for the purpose. He confiderei
i numerous representation as the great
ft security of liberty in a jepublicai
jovernment, and questioned the pro
iriety of the number being reduced
:ven by a convention. He concludei
.vith exprefling his hopes that the a
nendment would be rejected.
Mr. Steele, thought that a numer
>us representation was not always th
riterion of {lability in national coun
ils. He said, there would be littl
langfir of corruption in the house whil
he present pure system of reprefenta
ion continued ; and that the large re
irefentation in the (late legislature
)ught not to be a rule for Congrcfs, a
t evidently precluded the necellity o
heir adopting a similar plan. H<
bought a large ratio the mofl eligible
is a member of a free assembly afway
:onliders himfclf the more refponfcbh
or his conduÂ£l in proportion to thi
lumber that watch over him. This wa
>roved in the representatives of petti
>oroughs in England, who were eve
afier to be tampered with than the re
irefentatives of great cities.
Mr. Clarke, urged several argu
ncnts againfl a very numerou* rep re
entation, and hoped a larger ratii
vould be fixed on than one to thirty thou
and. Improper ele&ions (he oblerved
ire the great causes of any nation lofini
ts liberty ; and if Congress take car*
0 guard againfl abuses of this kind
uch a flep would operate much mon
powerfully againfl corruption than ai
:xorb:tant increase of representation
rie hoped no gentleman would confide
lim as a friend to ariflocracy for oppo
ing the ratio of one to thirty thousand
if, however, he had really caught th
iriftocratical infection, it had been finci
lis admiifion into the house.
Mr. Vining declared himfelf in fa
/ or of the ratio of one to thirty-four thou
and. He thought a trifling" differenc
n the number could not possibly afFeÂ£
he liberties of America ; and as ti
:orruption in that house, he saw n<
jood grounds for laboring under ap
irehenfions of this kind.
Mr. Hillhouse, said there could h
10 danger of corruption, so long as th
right of election remains in the people
1 representation of eighty or one hun
ired members he thought amply fuffici
:nt for the preservation of liberty, an<
hat a larger representation would ra
her embarrass the government, thai
mfwer any valuable purpose.
Several other gentlemen having de
:lared their sentiments on the fubjei
it the ratio, Mr. Muhlenberg reported
hat the committee had come to a refo
ution thereupon, as follows :
Resolved, That the number of re
ireientatives shall, until the next enu

antiquated opinions were publilhed and circulat

been bold enough to ridicule and oppose the vil

persecuted, tormented, and impiifoned, througl

From the Leyden Gazette, Sept. 20, 1791.
Extract of a letter from Paris, of Tuesday th
1 oj September, at 9 o'clock in the evening,
" We haden to inform vou of the accepta
tion made this day, by the King, of the Condi
tution. i o-morrow will bring us the corr.ple
tion cf this good news, and we forefee nothin;
t ow hut a happy futurity for France, and per
hips for all Europe. At present we (hall onl;
give you a short account of what palled this da
in the National Aflembly.
" The fitting of the 13th began at 10 o'clock
A. M. It had been remarked, that on the pre
fent.ition of the ctmjii tutional acl to the King, hi;
Majesty, and fevaral persons round-him, wen
decorated with the ribbon of the Holv Ghofl
M. Goupli therefore moved that the Conflitution
al committee should immediately give their opi
Â»ion on the quelhon whe(her the members of tbt
heretofore order of the Holy Ghost should con
tinue to wear its diflinftive badge ? M. Beauzai
aid, that it was ufelels to refer this queflion tc
the committee, since there was no doubt that the
3rder not fubfiÃing any longer, all its exterioi
badges should likewise be abolished. Mr. Gou
pil proposed, that the ribbon of the Holy Ghofl
should be exclusively reserved to the French
Princes, and M. Languinais that none but the
King and Prince Roval should be allowed tc
year it. M. D <nd e supported this opinion, or
he ground that it was necessary to give an ex
etior mark of diftinftion to the King, as sirs
public functionary, and to the presumptive hei
3ft e crown. The AfTcmbly decreed, that th<
iCing and Prince Royal only, should be allowet
o wear the blue ribbon.
" 7 he AfTembly was proceeding on other bu
*pefs, when the Minifler of Justice entered ir
lis robes of ceremony, and delivered a meffagi
rom the King to the President, who is now M
Thouret. Ihe President read it immediately. I
is all in the King's own hand writing, and th<
:ontents thereof are as follows :
From a Paris paper, entitled Le Courier Extra
ordinaire, ou Le premier arrive, by M. Bu
plain ; of September 14, 1791.
Letter from the King to the AfTembly*
Gentlemen,
I have attentively examined the Conflitution
il Ad: which you have presented to me. Ido ac
:ept it, and will cause it to be executed. Thi
simple declaration might at another time hav
Deen fufficient : but now i am bound to make ih
riotives known ; it is a duty which I owe to th
Nation and to myfelf.
For a long time I had conceived the design 0
ixing the happiness of the people on invariabl
)afes. i truck with several abuses which weaken
:d the springs of government; /truck above a!
with the diiproportion which existed in the fman
rial department, between the receipts and expen
litures, I determined to fubjed all the parts c
government to uniform rules. But sensible tha
could not alone reach this great objed,
iimmoned the nation to my afliftance.
111 the course of the events of the revolutior
ind when you began to issue constitutional decree;
did not wait to give my all'ent to them unt:
he constitution should be completed. 1 favouro
is much as was in my power the establishment c
ts several parts, even before 1 could judge of th
vhole and if, in the course of your operations
liforders came to afflid my mind, I hoped tha
he law would resume its empire and its force
ind that the people would shew it that refpe<s
ind that confidence which alone can insure the*
lappinefs.
I ptrfifted a long while in this expedation, an<
ny resolution did not change until hope forfool
ne. Let every one recoiled the era at which .
eft Paris opinions then, far from uniting in Â«
:ommon centre, branched o .t into several parries
iiforders and the licentiousness of writings wen
hen at their height; no authority was refpeded
could no longer dil'cerii nor recognize in th<
nidfl of that chaos, the real with of the Frenct
Siation.
â¢ hen had you presented the conftituticn to me
should not have tho't that the interest of the
>eople ought to induce me to accept it. I had bui
me sentiment, but one wiiiiâthat of keeping ai
distance from all parties, and thus to know, in 2
r ery precise manner, the wish of the nation.
The motives which then direded me, do not
low fubfifk any longer ; you have manifefted youi
vill to maintain order ; you have revised the con
titution, and you have modified some articles of i
vhich appeared to me to be liable to great incon
veniences.
You have fubjeded its revision to legal forms; ii
ine, the wish of the people cannot be any longe;
loubtful to me, 1 have seen them conitantly giv<
heir adhesion to this conflitution which you havi
nade for me . Ido thereiore accept thisconftitu
ion and I engage myfelf to defend it against en â¢
nies from within and from without ; I fnallcaufi
tto be executed by all the means which it put:
nto my power.
Knowing that it is agreeable to the wishes of 1
rery great majority of the nation, I do declare
hat in adhering thereto, I renounce the con
:urrence which 1 had at fir It claimed in this bu
inefs, and that being the only peri'on who is re
ponfible to the nation only, no other, when >
nake this renunciation, has a right to complain
)f it.
1 should, however, be wanting in regard fox
:iuth, if I did not fay that I have thought 1
pcrceived in some parts of your work, a want oi
:hat energ which is indifpenfible to give all the
leceffary ad*ivity to the laws, and to preserve
:he necessary unity throughout all the parts of a
vast empire; but in this refped, experience alone
has a right to be the judge, and when I fhallhave
bona jide caused the laws (the deposit whereof is
trusted to me) tobe carried into execution, it will
remain for the nation to explain themselves by all
the means which are reserved to them.
But, gentlemen, for the securing of liberty, for
the security of tlie conflitution, for the individual
[ecurity of all Frenchmen, their refpedive and
:ommon interests must be united in the re-esta
blishment of order, and in the relped due to the
taws; all Frenchmen mult combine together,and
now that the conflitution is terminated, we have
no enemies to fear but disorder and anarchy, and
[ will combat those common enemies.
Those whom perfccution has kept at a diflance
ought, in returning to their country, to be sure of
meeting with the protedion of the laws, and in
order to extinguiih all animofitics, and to unite
all the parties which such a revolution must ha*c
produced, let us consent to forget all the pail.
Let the accufationsand prosecutions which have
fpi ur.g from the events of the revolution be ex
tingukhed by a general reconciliation. Could you
fee culprits in those who have shewn an attach
ment to isy pcrfon ? As to thoi'c who by a guilty
orindifcreet zeal have drawn upon them the ri
jour of the laws, 1 feel that I am for their
:he King of all Frenchmen.
(Signed) LOUIS.
September, 13, 1791.
P. S. 1 have thought, gentlemen, that it wai
n the midst of the Representatives of the Nati
>n, and in the very place where the cenfiitutior
vas made, that I ought 10 pronounce my accep
ation in person. In coniequence, I give yot
lotice, 1 ha*, to-morrow at noon 1 {hall repair t<
he Aflembly of the Reprelentatives of ihe Na
ion, (oleinnly to pronounce that acceptation."
Loud plaudits had frequently interrupted thi
fading of this letter ; but when it was finilhed
hey began with redoubled force, and with Ihout
>r Vive le Roi!
Then M. la Favettc rose and fa!d: " Leti
ie permitted tome to join here iny \vi!h to tha
if the King, and to move tbe adopting of hi
entiments. I move, that all perlons accufet
ind arretted by reason of the King's departure

H- repealed; and that the conflituiional com
mttee and the committee of criminal jurifpru
lence bring in to-itiorrow a bill conformable t<
nele propositions."
This monon was received with transport
everal members rising to support it.
M. Goupil then moved, that a deputation 0
txty members Ihould immediately be fentto ex
jreis to the King the fatisfa&ion of the Aflem

The bonefty and upright moral character of

lave also taught us how to pay a proper regard
to the lives and honors of our fellow creatures,
as well a3 their fortunes; and iaftly, they have

A nation a&uatcd by such ideas can boast of

Your do&rines flial.l not be denied 3
And'tho* you make things mighty clear,
I'm almost vex'd, to fee you here :
A fate like this impends o'er allâ
(Even high-heel'd ftioes at length must fall !)
But, whether preach'd in prose or rhyme,
'TkvcuJd better suit another time.
How can wejuftly blame the fire
That gives us so much to admire !
]f people skulk when temples burn,
How can they but to ashes turn-â?
Such fire as this some ivater claimsâ
These are, indeed, no common flamesâ
So leave me, Love, to sigh and poutâ
You run anel help to put them cut !

WHEREAS it has been found', that diver? 01
the foreign settlers who have arrived here by v'.r
tue of the royal order granting permifiion to efta.
blifli themselves in this said province, bring witl:
them quantities of dry goods and other merchan
dize, whereby doubts have arose with government
whether such effe&s are their genuine_nroperty. or
not. In order therefore to guard against the de
triments which from such importations may ensue
to the royal revenue, and to the consumption oi
the Spanish merchandize, I had a council con
vened of the ministerS of the royal finance, and
the business having been laid before them, which
had been previously imparted by the cantador of
the royal revenue, it was agreed upop to draw up
these presents, hereby notifying to all and every
foreigner, whose intention it may be to repair to
this province,' and to swear fealty to his majesty
in terms of his royal permiflion, that although
there is no limitation made as to the property
brought with them } the fame muii, however, be
accompanied by such family as they may respec
tively have, and also by proofs taken before the
magistracy of the places of their former residence,
whereby it (halt appear that the goods they io im
port are realiy and bona fide their own, and that no
cither person or persons whatever have any part,
ihare or interest therein, which teflimonial, toge
ther with a manifeft upon oath, of the attides so
imported, are to be presented to this government,
at the time required for their taking the oath of
allegiance. This being the form indifpenfibly
requisite for their admilSon, it must however be
underload, that for the better advancement cf
the province, and in conformity to the spirit cf
his Majesty' s orders, such kttlers must positively
be planters or tradefmea ; but by no means will
nerchants or traders be reccivas ;--e r rherto
n/ant fta;e of the colony, as vet but thinly peo

>f this employment, until the caon:ry ffiali b.
uevioufly improved, and rendered â¢â productive ty

I fv.-cnr to von fnoft foletrmly that 1

It is no impoflible that fuperftitioi:

hat they burst out into a laugh, when
