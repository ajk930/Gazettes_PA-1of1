the Low Countries.
[Continuedfrom our lajl and cmcluded.~]
'"THHESE measures, which France

in the refpe&ive dates, and with which
the despotic agents of the French Go
vernment would be fatisficd.
"We (hall avoid taking notice of all the
calamities with which France is affliSed,

the machinations perpetually recommend
ed by a set of inlidio writers in their
dangerous publications, were it not evident
that, at the moment of the intended ag
grefiion against thef>- provinces, a refolu
tion is taken to spread the poison of a
fedu&ive illufiou on the pretended advan
tages of the French constitution, with a
view to make those partakers of it who
may be deluded by th s means ; but it is
neceflary that the people who are confided
to our governm nt be reminded and in

at this time, in the name of liberty,
under the moil hateful slavery, every fpe

and of a species of anarchy which is with

are abolished ; that the ho'.y religion

of their just rights, ill treated, persecuted

not er.joy in society, and which he tacitly
renounces,bybeing born in civilized aflocia

unequal proportions, moral faculties, the
very disproportion of which has always de

industry, and economy, over,the opposite
qualities, to .ether with all the advantages
which may lawfully arise from them, and
which maybe transferred like every other

" Finally, it is nectfTa y that the faith

that, whilst pains are taken to extol the

Paris, May 15.
The season of inconsiderate rashness is
past. Concealing from the nation its re
al situation would now be the height oi
treason, and encouraging it to go forward
when on the brink of a precipice. The
real enemies of the people are those who
deceive by flattering them: their true
friends are those, who discover to them the
nature and tendency of their disease, and
(how them how to apply the remedy. It
is time that the people knew how to f.irm
a real opinion of ministers, clubs, fa&ious
and perverie writers, who would risque the
fafety of the kingdom, and the success of
the revolution upon a sudden and ill ad
vised war. We can no longer doubt that
the army of M. de la Fayette, instead of
marching to attack the enemy's country,
is absolutely destitute of every thing, and
that the division of ins army, encamped
at Tiercelet, was compelled to return to
its quarters, without powder, ball, field
pieces or artillery-men, ,

" It may be set down es a certainty
that Spain will not join the enemies of
France in any war agair.ft her. As to
the Swiss regiments which were to have
been taken into the pay of Spain, the new
minister has declared them unneccfTary,
and has given orders to break off all ne
gociation on this fubjeft. It may be pro
per to 1 etnark that the court of Spain was
in this temper previous to the news arriv
ing of the aifaflination of the king of
Sweden. This base action, which is evi
dently the work of a Swedish ariltocracy,
has confounded the French emigrants

ding in our ears, that "a nobility is th_
support of a throne," and that " without

a thousand other similar absurdities which

Count d'Aranda is too well informed of

" His- holincfs the Pope lias some time
nice undertaken to drain the marshes of
Pofltini. Although, in ballads, they
praise him for having succeeded in an at
: inpt which b:ifiled the wealth and ing;-
mity of the ancient Romans, yet the work
â  110 farther advanced than to render the
'[â¢fian way practicable, which has been
! 1; many years, in places, covered with

â â¢vis i ore are wanting, as well as at least
; uo.oo persons, of a very different defcrip
>ll from the beggars and fiuggards that
j c now employed. If indulgences had the
1 .ne credit now as formerly, it would be
good method, and a cheap one, to for
ard the undertaking "
April 21. " The holy office of the
1 quifition continues very severe against
tie French fettled, and coming here. In
c infeqtfcnce of its rigour they are every
ly leaving Rom-.-, and in a short time
t lere will only be tliofe here whose arif
t lcratic principles prevent suspicion.â
1 lie pretence for profotibing the patriotic
I rench is, that they are no other than
m.flionaries of French revolution princi
pies. People of underllanding, however,
are convinced that the patriotic principles
. tiie French will difTeminate impercepti
bly. I hey are so general, so congenial
with human reason, of a tendency so be
nevolent to the human race, that their uni
versal adoption depends neither upon age,
nor clime, nor prejudice. If the French
tongue is universally spoken and under
stood through Europe, is that the fault
of the French ? Mult they either be fi
ient, or speak a langu ge different from
their ownâMud they not build up their
own houses, now tottering in ruins, for
fear their neighbours fliould take the hint
and build up theirs also ?âlf there is any
t.iÂ£t in the world clear and evident, it is
this, that in every country governments
are the sworn enemies of liberty. The
love of liberty, however, is so natural to
mankind that the Declaration of his Rights
by such a nation as France will surmount
.ill obflacles, and will extend throughout
the world without the intervention of
ngents and missionaries, which have ever
been neceflary to the caufc of despotism
and superstition."
Turin, April 30.
At no period has the king of Sardinia
been more ptofufe of titles than at the
prcfent. The titles of count, marquis,
crofles of St. Maurice, &c. See. are la
vished upon the moll contemptible cha
racters. It is commonly said here, that
his raajefty is determined to annihilate
nobility by making it universal : but the
true cause is the fear of increasing the de
ficiency in the revenue. As his majefly
has not wherewithal to recsmpenfe every
deserving man that asks a pension, he in
lieu thereof gives him titles and crosses.
An application to the folly of mankind
for the payment of debts, is a good con
ceit enough, but is by no means an inex
h?.tiflible fund. Honours bellowed in
discriminately lose their effect, and cease
(o be a diftindlion. The order of St.
Maurice is so common here, that almofl
every man you meet might be fafely ac
costed, Sir Knight. In a short time it
will be as common as the Older of St. John
de Lateran at Rome, which may be pur
chased for a single sequin (2 dollars.)

" There is -much talk here, of four
French emigrants, who are come to pay a
viiit to Mefdumes, the French kir. -'s
Hunts, now resident in this city, in a pa
lace they have hired. The moment theft:
ariftocratical rrentlemen were introduced,
the princtffes salute 1 them, fliedding tears
of joy on the occasion. Indeed tliere is
no doubt, they are four of the linccreit
friends the princefTes have in the woild,
and everybody, without exc. ption, speaks
well of thern. r i hefe emigrants arc no
other than four large dogs which, r:s be
tng particular favorites the ladies have had
brought from Versailles, to help pass away
the tedious hours during their reiidence in
Home, and at Naples.
" Events that hive recently taken place
in Rome, have an illafpeft for agovernment
such as theirs, the reins of which are n?tu
raliy weak. The precautions taken to
prevent mifchicf, seem to have a contrary
effect. The peop'e, notwithllanding their
profound ignorance, have an evident incli
nation towards republican government,
and there are not wanting thofc who will
tempt them to revolt, by holding up the
idea that they are soon to be fubjeft'jd to
power, absolute and despotic. A ferment
of minds and diLontent is therefore be
coming more and more ripe, in eve y pro
vince of the ecclesiastic (late. News is jail
come in that the people have lifen and
thrown into a well the prelatic-j'overiior
of a town in the neighbourhood of Rome.
It were to be wi(hed, there may not be a
general infurredlion. As the people are
armed, and naturally ferocious, terrible ex
amples would be made, no doubt, and the
rivers be tinged with blood. The opini
on of the populace, that they are the deP.
cendents of the old Romans, feem3 to
inflame their indignation ; and there is
nothing wanting but some Rienzi to de
clare himfelf tribune of the people, lead
them to the capitol, and the papal govern
ment would in a very lhort time fall to the
ground.

tirely ex tin ft and suppressed. Even the
society of brother-taylors and bi other flioe

" A cordon of troops are ordered to
cover our frontier on the fide of Leige.
Several regiments are already on their
march for Venloo, Maellrecht, and the
country round about. The discontents
as well as the number of the patriots are

ample of the king of Sweden will fhevv to
what enormities men will proceed when
rendered desperate. Both the Stadthol

reconciliation with the patriots ; aud for
this purpose a general amneily has been
published, the prerogatives of the Stadt
liolder are abridged, and the orange cock
ades as well as all other external marks of
party, be they what they may. It is ea
sy to fee, however, that this will not fatis

a variety of unjust procedures againit

A Society entitled the Friends of thepeo
pie, associated tor the purpose of obtain
ing a parliamentary reform, held their
firlt general meeting at the Freemafoits
Tavern, London, the 26th April, 1792,
and have published a declaration and
address of which the following are co
pies.
DECLARATION.
" A number of persons have seriously
reviewed and considered the actual fituati
Â©n of public affairs, and Hate of the king
dom, and having communicated to each
other their opinions on these fubjeÂ£ts, have
agreed and determined to institute a So
ciety for the purpose of propoling to Par
liament and to the country, and of â pro
moting, to the utmost of their power, the
following conflitutional objects, making
the preservation of the cor.ftitution, on its
true principles, the foundation of all their
proceedings.
First.â" To restore the freedom of
election, and a more equal reprefentaiion
of the people in pailiametit.
Secondly.â" To secure to the people
a more frequent exercise of their right ior
eleÂ£ting their repi efentatives.
'â¢ The persons who have signed their
names to th'S agreement, think that these
two fundamental measures will furnifh the
power and the means of correcting the
abuses, which appear to them to have ari
sen from a negleift of the acknowledged
principles of the conllitution, and of ac
complishing those iubordinate objects of
reform which they deem to be essential to
the libert-'cs of the people, andtothegooJ
government of the kingdom."
Address to the People of Great Britain.
No man, who is not ready to express
his concurrence in our principles, by sign
ing the Declaration, cm be admkted into
our society. The objects of it, as we c n
ceive, are of a nature at all times lit to be
pursued and recommended to the country.
At different periods they have heretofore
been avowed and supported by the high
est authorities in the kingdom ; by emi
iient individuals ; and considerable bodies
of men ; by Mr. Locke and Judge Black
ftone, by the late Earl of Chatham, and
Sir George Seville; by the Duke of
Richmond,the Marquis of Lanfdown,Mr.
Fitt,and Mr Fox ; by petitions from sev
eral counties and by repeated declarations
from the city of London.
In appealing to the avowed opinions of
men of established reputation, or of distin
guished r.ink in this country, we do not
mean to llrengthen the reason, or enforce
the nece iTity of the measure we propose,
so much as to obviate all personal imputa
tions, which the enemies of the cause will
be ready to throw upon those who sup
port it. It. is not that, on our account,
we dread the effect, or regard the impres
sion which such imputations mayproduce
But we think it material to the credit and
success of our proceedings, to fliew that
we are not a miTig at reform unthought of
by wife and virtuous menâthat our opi
nions neither possess the advantage, nor
are liable to the objection of novelty, and
that we cannot be accused or fufpedted of
faitious purposes, or dangerous designs,
without extending the fame accusation or
fupicion to the motives of men, whose G
tuation and property, independent of their
charaÂ£ter, principles, and abilities, have
given tliem a molt important flake in the
peace and good government of the king
dom.
Convinced by our own reflections, by
experience, and by- authority, that the
thing we propose to do is fit to be done,
we have with equal deliberation, weighed
the reasons that may recommend, or
be obje&ed, to the present time, as llie
mod or lead proper for bringing it for
ward. On this point we have no addrl's
to make to the determined enemies ofla
reform of every kind. Their obje&idL
whether valid or not, is to the fubflanceÂ»f
the measure, and cannot be abated by cir
cumflances. To those, who concur gen
erally in the principle, but who maybe in
clined by particular reasons, to defer the
attempt, we seriously wish to submit the
following conliderations : That admitting
be a season of general tranquility in
the country, it is, on that account, the
more proper for temperate refledtion, and
prudent exertions to accomplish any ne
ceflary improvement ; it is the time wlten
pradticalmeafures Lr that purpose are mod
likely to be adopted with discretion and
pursued with moderation. If we are per
suaded to wait for other times of a different
complexionâtor times of public complaint,
or general discontent, we (hall then be to'd,
that general remedies are not fit to be pro
ofed in the moment of particular disorder-,
an 1 that it is our duty to wait for the re
turn of quiet days, unltfs we mean to clp
ate or tncreafe confufion in the county.
The result of this dilemma, if it be fuffeijd
to prevail, is pure and absolute inaftivMy
at present, and forever. On the otljjr
hand, if it be true, as we are convinceapt
is, that, in this general appearance of tran
quillity, there is some mixture of discon
tent, as well as of drongand well-grounded
opinion, 011 the fubjedt of abuses in the
Government, and corruptions of the Con
(litution, we wish it to be considered by
men, v hose judgment has been formed or
enlightened by experience, and whose ac
tions are mod likely to be directed by pru
dence, whether in taking proper meafurea
Lo remove the cause and objedls of such
discontent and opinion, the choice of the
time be not a material part of the measure ;
and whether the earliest time that can be
taken, for preventing the encreafe of an
exilting evil, be not the fafeft and the bed :
The example and iituation of another
kingdom are he'd out to deter us from in
novations of any kind. We fay that the
reforms we have in view are not innova
tions. Our intention is not to change,
but to redore ; not to displace, but to re
inflate the conllitution upon its true prin
ciples and oiiginal ground. In the con
duct of ptrfons mod likely to reproach us
with a spirit of innovation, we fee a solid
ground for retorting the imputation.â
Their profeffions of admiration of the
beauty and of zeal for the security of the
conflitution, appear to us too lavish to be
iincere, especially when compared with
those practical violations, with which they
fuffer tliia beautiful fyflem to be invaded,
and to which they never refufe to give
their concurrence. They will not inno
vate, but they are no enemies to gradual
decay ; as if the changes insensibly pro
duced by time, and nourished by negledt,
were not in effedt the mod dangerous in
novations. But what security have we
that the dispositions of such men are not
something worse than passive ? How are
we assured that, in praiiing the conflitu
tion, their intention is not to adorn a vic
tim, which they wish to facrificc, or to
flatter the beauty endeavoring to
corrupt .' Let their intention be what it
may, we answer their accusations in the
words of one of the wised of mankind ;
*" that time is the greatcjl innovator ; and
if time of course alter things to the worse, and
if wisdom and counsel shall not alter them
to the better, what shall be the end."
By the reform proposed by lord Chat
ham, he declared in the House of Lords,
that he meant to infufe a portion of new
health into the conjlitution. The Duke of
Richmond has declared, $ "that his reasons
in favor of a parliamentary refoim were
formed on the experience of twenty-fix
years, which, whether in or out of go
vernment, had equally convinced him, that
the reparation of a genuine House of Commons
by a renovation of the rights of the people,
was the only remedy againjl that fyfiem tj
corruption, which had brought the nation to
disgrace and poverty, and threatened it with
the loft of liberty
* Lord Bacon
$ Jan. 1783.
Other authorities in favour of a parliamen
tary reform, as direÂ£l aad explicit as these:,
might be quoted in abundance. The public
ispoffeffed of them. We rather wish to en
counter, because we are sure we can efface,
in every rational mind, the impression
which may have been made by a view of
those events which have attended .1 total
reform in the conllitution of France.
deny the ex'tjience of any rrftmblance whatever
between the cases, of the two kingdoms : and
<we utterly disclaim the neccjfity of resorting to
similar remedies. We do not believe that,
at this day, an absolute avowed despotism
in the hands of the executive power would
be endured in this country. But who can
fay to what conclusion the silent unrefifled
operation of abuses incessantly adling and
constantly increasing may lead us hereaf
ter ; what habits it mny gradually create ;
what power it may finally eflablifh ? The
abuses in the government of France were
fuffered to gather and accumulate, until
nothing but an eruption could put an end
to them. The discontent of the people
was converted into despair. Preventive
remedies were either not thought of in
time, or were not pro|;ofed until it was
too late to apply them with effedt. The
fubveriion of the ancient government en
sued. The inference from this coinpari
fon is at once so powerful and so obviou;,
that we know not by what argument to
illuflrate or enforce it. We mean to avert
forever from our country the calamities
inseparable from ftich convullions. If there
be,as it is said, in any part oi thiskingdom.
a disposition to promote confulion, 01
even to arrive at improvement by uncon
stitutional and irregular courses, we hold
ourselves as flridlly pledged to refill thai
disposition wherever it may appear, as tc
pursue our own unexceptionable
methods. If, on the contrary, it be true,
that the mass of the people are fatisfied
with the present state of tilings, or indiffe
rent about it; if they approve of the re
presentation as it Hands, the form of elec
tion, and the duration of the trull; or if,
condemning these things, they are deter
mined, from indolence or despair, not tc
attempt to corredl them ; then indeed
the effoits of individuals may bt inef
fedlual, but they cannot be injurious
to the peace of the community. If th<
spirit of the conlli'ution be dead in the
hearts of the people, no human indi'.flry
can revive it. To affirm that extenfivc
mifchief may be done by a flatement oi
fails or arguments, which make no gene
ral impiCilion on the public mind, is s
proportion that ccntradidls itfelf, and re
quires no other refutation. We trull it
will be proved by experiment, that these
incoiilHlent affert.or.G are equally Unsound
ed, and that the peop'e of this countiy
are no more disposed to submit to abuses
without complaint, than to look for re
dress in any proceedings repugnant to the
laws, or unwarranted by the conflitution.
Between anarchy and despotism, fpeakine
for ourselves, we have no choice to make :
we have no preference to give. We neithei
admit the neeeffity, nor can we endure the
idea of resorting to either of these extre
mines as a refuge from the other. The
course we are determined to pursue, is
Equally distant from both.
Finally we assert, that it mull be blind
ness not to fee, and treachery not to ac
knowledge,
That " J the inflruments of power are
not so open and avowed as they formerly
were, and therefore the less liable to jea
lous and invidious reflections ; but they
ire not the weaker upon that account. In
Tiort, our national debts and taxes have,
p. their natural consequences, thrown such
i weight of power into the executive scale
)f government, as we cannot think was
ntended by our patriot anceflors, who
jlorioufly ilruggled for the abolition of
lie then formidable parts of the preroga
ive, and by an unaccountable want of
"orefight eflablifhed this system in their
lead." Our general objedt is to recover
and preserve the true balance of the con
llitution.
Thise are the principles of our
association, and on our Heady adhe
rence to them, we look with a juil confi
dence to the approbation and support of
the people in the prosecution of our ob
jedl. A measure so likely to be opposed
by the united flrength of various interests,

[From the spirit and tenor'of the above
address, it is moll prelumeable (fays a cor
respondent) that the late proclamation of
the British king, againll what art termed
seditious publications and afiaciations, is not
the less pointed at the friends of the people,
and other societies now forming in Eng
and, for obtaining a reform in parliament,
than the order of the king, in council, for
an encampment on BagQiot-heath of an
army of seven or eight thousand men, to
commence on the iirfl. of July (in(lant)
and terminate on the sixteenth of the
fame month, alTuredly is, to overawe
that riling spirit of revolution, which go
vernment thus obviou/ly betrays its fears

IGNORANCE is the only cause of the
misery and opprcflion of mankind : ty
rants are so fem'ible of this, that they pro
hibit all talking, writing, and even think
ing on fubje&s calculatcd to inftruÂ£t the
minds of the peopleâat the dawn of the
present glorious revolution in France, po
litical clubs frequently met at the coffee
houfes ; the king issued an edict prohibiting
such meetings---The kings of Europe are
at this moment uling every effort to pre
vent, their fubjefts from investigating the
principles of religioiyor government : And
a junto of American ariftocitits, influenced
by the fame spirit, arepurfuing similar mea
sures. A venal press, considered as a ne
cefl'ary appendage to the general govern
ment, is constantly employed in bellowing
fulfonie commendations on the molt unwar
rantable aits of government; anc! in ab uling
those free citizenswho presume to come for
ward with their opinions on public measures.
But the friends if mankind are not discouraged.
At a time when the light of the French re
volution is procuring ihe rights of man to
the long opprefled people of Europe, Ame
rican citizens certainly will not facrifice
their acquired rights to an ambitious and
avaricious junto, who have tlic vanity to
measure the prosperity of our country not
by the general ease andhappinefs of the peo
ple, but by the palaces, funiptuous fearts,
md parade of the well-born few, supported
jy the plunder of their fellow citizens.

The spirit of party fn New-York, ref
pefting the late ele&ion for Governor of
the State, is said to have risen to such a
height as to occasion several duels. A
mongll these, Col. Marinua Willett, and
Wihiam Wilcocks, Esq. had a meeting,
ind exchanged a few (hots; but their
friends interfering, prevented any bad con
iequences. Col. Willett is friendly to Gov.
CJlinton's election, which is opposed by
Mr. Wilcocks.
The Rev. Mr. Thayer, Catholic Mifli
anary at Boston, has challenged John Gar
diner, Esq. of the Hate of Malhichufetts,
to a theological disputation, iu public, on
the truth of certain do&rinal tenets of the
Romish Church, such as tranfubllantiaticn,
purgatory, &c. âMr. Gardiner having asÂ«
lerted the whole to be unintelligible non
sense.
According to the Albany Gazette, a
deputation from the Chiefs of the Five
Nations are on their way to the Miami
village, where a treaty is ihortly to be held
by the hoftilc Indians. This deputation
13 feut under the direction of the Super
intendant of Indian Affairs, and charged
with a message from the executive of the
United States to the said Indians, demand
ing a ceiTation of hostilities until measures
can be taken to bring about a general trea
ty of peace.
The fame Gazette fays, " Capt. Jofepli
Brandt returned through the city of Alba
ny on the 6th inltant, from his vilit to the
President of the United States. Capt.
Brandt has exprelTed himfelf much pleased
with the reception he met with from thePresident, and the polite treatment he has
received during his whole tour. We are
informed that his belt endeavours will be
uf*_d to establish a treaty of frienddiip be
tween the United states and the present
hostile ttibes of Indians; and thai it is
more than probable, on his return home,
he will immediately let off for the Miami
village. 3 '
George Clinton, Esquire, on the 3d inft.
was qualified into oltics as Governor of the
state of New-York ; and the day follow
ing was ele&ed P elidept of the Society of
the Cincinnati of that state.
It is mentioned in a Salem paper, (M.)
that a superb plan of a rapitol has been
forwarded to the commiffi >ners of the fe
deral buildings in the city of Walhington,
by, an eminent artiftj relident in Salem.â
Also, that the ingenious Mr. Perkins, of
Newburyport, has been fer.t for, from this
city, to execute the coinage of the United
States.
The annivtrfary of the French revolu
tion was celebrated on Saturday last, in
N*v- York, by the Tammany Society. A
number of respectable French gentlemen
attended, upon invitation, and made a
liandfome address to the Grand Sachem
of the focicty, which was lultably replied
to. An elegant collation was soon after
prepared, at which leventeen loalts were
drank, highly exprefTive of the part each
nation took in commemorating their re
fpedtive revolut oris.
An address appears in a Be'fait (Irish)
paper, addressed to the people of Ciller
representing to them in a strong iight the
miserable litnation they are actually in,
their Hill worse projects if they remain,
and advice to emigrate to the forelts of
America, rather than exitt in a country
where the itrong arm of power cru'lies the
inhabitant to the dust, without hope or
remedy. It isfaid, tl.at in consequence of
this address, and ther incitements, a large
emigrati n to these coasts will f.ion take
place. Sincerely it is to be hoped that
the wisdom of our government will so
compromise matters with the Indian tribes
as to give thef foreigners af<. e afyluin in
the wel'ern woods ; hat in flying from
the sceptre of tyranny, they may not fall
vidtims to the scalping knives of the irri
tated, uninformed savages.
The anniversary of American Indepen
dence has been celebrated far and wide by
the si iends of America tind republican go
vernment âThe r 4th of July, as far as we
have yet heard, has been the obj Ct of al
mod equal attention by the patriots of
America, and will no doubt in future be
considered as our second day of eminence
in the calendar of Liber'y.
A paper mak r of uote in England
has discovered a cticmical process, which
renders paper, made of any rags whatever,
as white as those made of the iineft kind.
This discovery at once cheapens paper 25
per cent. This is mentioned in all the
London papers we have l'ecn, as a fadt.
The Fourth of July having turned out
to be a rainy day at Cariifle, tin- inhabi
tants put off the celebration of the glori
ous event Independence, to the Jth,
which perfedtly answered their expedta
tions. From this example it would seem
proper i 1 future to " Indepen
dence to be celebrated on the fourth of
July, or, if bad weather, the next fair
day after."
If peace with the Indians can now be
accomplished upon moderate terms, (as is
intimated in the Ccntinel) after theirfuc
cess, it i< a proof of the inexpediency of the
Indian war. It shews that pence or war,
is within a /mail circle, and that a few in
dividua/s can deci 'e on this business, as it
fui.s their convenience. It is fufpefted,
that certain characters, finding that the
â¢war department arrests the attention of the
public,, arc now closing the fcenc, and pre
senting a thorough invejiigation, by
holding up the pro'pedts of peace.âBut
it is hoped that Congress, when adting
on the report of their committee, will
adhere to the dodtrine of responsibility,
which has been made the plea' for high
salaries, &c âand bring every man who
has been blameable in this difgraceful bu
siness, so answer for the blood fpiiled, and
the money expended.

There is a degree of refpedt due to every
government which a rational man will
never lose fight of, and will carefu'.ly pre
serve in his words and adtions as well as in
his ftridtures and reflections upon its faults
and abuses. i'ruth offered with decency
ought never to offend, and however defi
cient a country may be in men who are
not afraid to tell the ruling powers the
trutit seems to be proved from con-
Rant experience that they will never want
tor flatterers aad universal admirers :
" We're oft to blame in this
('Tis too much prov'd) that with devo

On Thursday, July 5, the Brig Charles
ton, Capt. Garman, on her pafiage from
this port to Cnarlefton, and within one
day's fail of the bar, was struck with light
ning. Both malls were struck, but the
foremaft and its topmalls fuffered moll.
A horse on deck was killed. The mate
and several of the hands were knocked
down, and remained lifelefs for some time;
and Mr. William P. Young, paflenger on
board, lay a confulerable time deprived of
his senses, and very much scorched and
othervvife hurt. The shock was so great,
that the brig, altho' going at the rate of
five or fix knots, was totally (lopped, and
continued motionless fome:ime.âlt is
iomewhat fur-prizing that so little atten
tion should be paid to arm veflels with
lightning-rods, to prevent mifchiefs of this
kind. They might be put on and taken
off at pleasure, with very little trouble.
On the 16th in ft. a large number of
patriotic citizens met at Corre's hotel,
New-York, and pa.Ted a number of reso
lutions, expreffivc of their sense of the
legality of Mr. Clinton's eledtion to tie
office of firlt magistrate of chat State,
and their determination to support him if
necellary i.i difchargi.ng the duties of his
office.âAt this nuetingit was iefolved
that " a circular letter be addieffed to the
iree and iudtp ndent ele&ors of the seve
ral counties o; thi llate, earnestly recom
mending to them, to preserve the peace
and tranqti lity of the community, and to
adopt relolutions expressing their fenle of
the violent meaf ires, which are now pur
suing by a certain party, to obtain rcdrefs
for a pretended injury committed on the
rights of tlu* people." Seventy-two ref
pe&able gentlemen of the city were ap
pointed a committee for this purpose.-â
On the 18th, pursuant to the resolutions,
several of the committee, accompanied by
a very large number of their fellow-citi
zens, waited on the Governor a: the go
vernment-house, and presented him n
address, congratulatin him on his re-elec
tion, regretting the inflammatory measures
pursuing by a party in the llate, promif-i
ing every affiilance in supporting the
constitution and laws of the country, &c.,
&c.âThe Governor returned a pulite an
swer to their addressâand afterwards
favoured above one hundred gentlemen
with his company at a public dinner at
Corre's hotel, when fifteen patriotic toalls
werÂ« drank, excluiive of Gov. Clinton's,

IF there exists a hell, (the cafe ii clear,)
.Sir Toby's slaves enjoy that portion here:
Here are no burning brimftdne lakes, 'tis true,
But kindled rum full often burns as blue ;
In which some fiend, half serious, half in jest,
Steeps Tobys : s name, and brands poor Cudjoe't
breast.
Here whips on whips excite a thousand fears,
And mingled howiings vibrate on my ears j
Here Nature's plagues abound, of all decrees,
Snakes, ftorpions, despots, lizards, centipeesâ
No art, no care efcapc6 the busy lash,
All have their dues, and all are paid in cash :
Theiengthy cart-whip guards this tyrant's reign,
And cracks, like pistols from the fields of cane.
Ye powers that formed these wretched tribes re
late,
What have they done to merit such a fate !
Why were they brought from Ebo's sultry waste
To fee the plenty that they must not taste ?
Food which they cannot buy, and dare not steal j
Yams and potatoes---many a scanty meal !
One y with a gibbet wakes his negroe's fears,
One to the wind-mill nails him by the ears ;
One keeps his slave in dismal dens unfed,
One puts the wretch in pickle ere he's dead ;
Tbis y to a tree suspends him by the thumbs,
That, from his table grudges even the crumbs!
O'er yon* rough hills a tribe of females go,
Each with her gourd, her infant, and her hoe,
Scorch'd by a fun, that has no mercy here,
Driven by a devil, that men call Overseer j
In chains twelve wretches to their labor haste,
Thrice twelve 1 fee with iron collars grae'd jâ-
Are these the joys that flow from vast domains,
Is gold thus got, Sir Toby, worth your pains ?
Who would your wealth on terms like these pofiefs,
Where all we fee-is pregnant with distress,
Angola's natives flogg'd by hireling hands,
And toil's hard product fhipp'd to foreign lands ?
Talk not of blofToms, and your endless spring,
No joy to me these scenes of mis'ry bring
Where Stygian pictures halt their shades renw*,
Pi&ures of woe that Virgil's pencil drew :
Where black-guard Charons make their yearly
trip > â¢ * â¢
And fouls arrive in every Guinea fliipâ
Where they who pine, and languish to be free
Must climb the tall cliffs of the Lganee ;
Beyond the clouds in skulking haste repair,
And hardly fate from brother butchers there.
