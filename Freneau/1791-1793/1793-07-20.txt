menced with the French army, under gen.
Dampierre, and continued with great vi
g tur on both fides till about five ill tile af
ternoon, when the Prulians began to live
vay. from the fe' ert fire of the French,
till the Duke of York came to their aflilt
ance. and with several regiments at tirft
repulsed the republican fori es, till assailed
by thr heavy ft e of a French battery,
which they intended to attack,but finding it
iiunolfible, made a retreat. Upwards of
70 o. the Britilh were kill d in this attack
The battle continued with this and the

Dampierre, who commanded the French,
received a cannon ball, alraolt (pent, in his
thigh, and died in consequence os-it on the
morning ot' the 10th. General Lamorliere
Succeeded him ill the command* On the

but early in the morning of the iiththfe
Auftrians and Prjiffians drove the French
from their batteries, and took pel'Vfiioil ol
eir polls in a wood. The French how
ever had previoufiy removed all their can
non. In this whole affair the French
hewed the greatest relu&ance 10 lire upon
he B'ritifh. avd in every initance ceased to
fire upon them the moment they began tu
retreat. Sacre Dien (said a French officer
to one of the Enjjlilh prisoners) why are
those free and gallant l?ritons come hither
todeflroy lis or be destroyed ! We have no
quarrel with them ; we are only contend
ing far that liberty which they enjoy, and
which they purchased at the expense of
the belt blood of their vceftors âWhen
the attack ceased. on the i;th. the Auf
trians fell back to their old ports; altho'
Hill in hopes to be able to drive the French
to their own fortified town, on the fron
tier: As to entering France, that was
another story. O'her accounts fay that
the united loss of tne Priillians and Airltri
ans was 2500 men; very few prisoners
were taken on either fide, and no cannon.
It was observed that the Pruflians had not
that stomach to figfct as formerly under the
great Frederick ; and had 110 artillery
with them except what is supplied by the
Auftrians. Want of provisions was again
becoming a serious evil among them, and
it was certain unless the campaign was
brought to a fpeeily conrlufion, the coc
plaint would become universal.
11 appears that the armies on the fron.
tiers have had several, less important, ac.
tio k ls th in the above, but none of them de
cifive. It is certain the war was not ac
tively pursued by any of the powers con
cerned in it, and one thing is remarkaole,
that the French troops are generally the
alfailants in every aftioa ; a proot that
they are not intimidated by the German
troops. The cou ltryi.i the vicinity oi the
armies in the Netherlands, isliteraliyeaten

beyond the limits of their own country.bj
which means they receive constant sup

despotic forcej in the face so early as the
middle of May.

In the Knglifh minillerial papers there arc
many reports of infurrreÂ£tions in Brittany
and other parts of France, and in one of
those papers, of May 23d, there is an ac
count of Nantz Surrendering to the roval
ifts 011 the 21 it of April. It is certain the
royalilts were never more aÂ£live than ;u
this time in France. Several engagement;
had taken place between the insurgent* and
the patriots, nearly 2000 of whom iÂ©d beer
flaiii in the department of tne Loire. The
weltern departments were also more or lef
agitated by the emifiaries of treachery anc
counter revolution, and it was said thai
the territory of Indre and Loire wa, ac
tually in pofleilion of the rebels, with the
towns of Breliuire, Tours, and Loudon.
The great cause of their fucqefs was the
treason of general <Jtiiteneau. an ageni

of every kind were enumerated, without
the aid of which they could not go onâ
These circumstances gave great cause of
murmur in England, and it was thought
the demand would go a great way towards
detaching England from the league ot

On the 28th of April a detachment of
French troops lauded at Gndavefberg, near
B rankfort, about one in the morning, and
advanced unperceived to a battery at which
a detachment ot Pca.fi 1a cannoneers had
been working all night, and where they
were then lying down to reft themselves.
The attack was so nnexpeÂ£fed, that thole
who were not at firll killed or made pri
loners, endeavoured to save themselves in
the neighbouring batteries, but the French
pursued them so closely, that the Saxon
troops, charged with guarding the other
batteries, yielded also to the inipetuoli y
ot tile assailants- The French spiked up or
deltroyed all their artillery, killed a great
number of officers and niatroifes, and tarried
olt a considerable number of prisoners. The

Six regiments had embarked from Ire

F EING afpeftatorat the late perform
ance of Mr. Rickets, which was intend
ed for thebenefitofthe poor,l was natural
ly led to fun ey the number and characters
us the company who had so eagerly em
braced an opportunity to second the liberal
designs of the performer; and I was hap
>y to disco: er that it was compofeii of the
jc-lt of our citizens j who, no doubt, walk
ed to the Cireus, not to gratify their eyes
ly viewing the exploits of a Hulled horfe
nan, or the conumptiblt scene of Johnny
3ilpin,of please theirhearing by the trifling
ivit of the Clown ; but, merely to erjay
'Jie Jatitfaltiou of contributing to alleviate
'he diflrejjes jgf the vjrttched. These pious
gentlemen, (who lately opposed a (imilar
iuiufeiueut,) through the exercise ol the
.veiling evidenced the fatisfa&ion they felt
from the abilities of the performers, and
he jollity of certain contingent circum
tanees. It aituaiiy appeared as if the huz
sa bad become aCuoihrute for amen.&ias
one hand met the other instead of the
breast.
1 am jaflihed in making these strictures
nn the appeal ance of such gentlemen " in
'uch a place." : 0111 the inconsistency it will
donbtlefs form in their characters, it is
certain that pcrfunj were prefenr ivho
: itely, in a violent manner, opposed the
legality of Theatres ; and who hav re
fined, or similar oe< alions, to cast in their
mite; all b cause the Theatre was made
the channel! \> lien a deltruÂ£tive fire re
duced fevtral valuable citizens to great
exigencies, the Old American Company
ativcrciied anigbt for their relief, and in
.n.de having a crowded house, (as was
the cafe w nk the Circus) to their own tuk
pnze - lid regfel, ti'.cy found themle.vts
unable to grant more than 178 dollars.
Tins i fiance proves that the prejudices
of the fe' men are so implanted in them by
education, that in one instance they reject
the reafo 1, Jiitl in tlie other gladly vindi
cate it propriety by their own exampJe.
Let ludi men anf'.ver, whether there is
more criminality in attending the Theatre,
than ill placing ihemieUes in a barefaced
nianuer to vie u the more trifling and lejt
iujtrn.ii. at; iiii tne-i 1s? of the Circus.'' Let
th':",!i, 1 n bed iu their holy vestments, put
their hands 011 their 1:> .rts and declare luch

cates, or tiitf more rational aiuufenaents ot
the itage.
I would now observe, that in faying
whet I have, I tlo not aim at difcounte
nancing the employment of Mr. RickettÂ».
On the contrary, I think he has received
110 more encouragement than his profi
ciency in his occupation deserves. Besides
being a manly exercise, horsemanship is a
profeffion for which I have always had :i
respect; and which, I think, ought to be
cultivated in the United ?tates. I hope,
therefore, Mr. Ricketts, or anv of his
cn-mpcmy, will not conceive that I wilh to
reflect on their occupations ; for if nothing
else, the late i haritable performance would
p : ice th'em out of the reach ol (lander. I
only meant<*remind the religions part o!
the community of the uniformity it would
be proper they should preserve in their
actions.

For the National Gazette.
Mr. Freneau,
f S the authority of Burl AM Aou i may
- * be, at leaji, equal to â¢ , Pacificus"wbofe
â writings like hi reports are pregnant with
sophistry and deception, I request you will
give the following extraÂ£ls from thisjuftly
celebrated author, a place in your paper.
" Public treaties are divided into rent
end per/analâthe latter are those made
â with a pr rice, purely in regard to hi per
son, and exp ; rc with him. The former
are fin h. are made rather with the
whoie body ol the (late, than with the
king or government, and which conse
quently outlive t iofe who uiade them and
oblige their successors.''
" To know to which of these twoclnfT Â»
every treaty belongs, the lollowing rule,
may be laid down:
lit. We mull fir ft attend to the form
a d phrase of the treaty, to its cltules, nnd
tVj views proposed by the contracting par
tiesâ" Utrum autem in rem. an in pe -
so lam factum eft, non minus ifc erbi ,
quam ex mente convenientium aelMnan
tluin eft," Thus, if there be an exprcf
clause, mentioning that the treaty is per
petual, or fur a ccrtain number f years.
or for the good of the fta'e, or with the
king for htm and his flit cellors," we ma)
conclude that the treaty is real.
idly. Every treaty made with a repub
J'u is in its own nature real, becatife tnt
fabjeft, with whom we contract it, is <
thing permanent.
3d. Though the government fliouk
happen to chaiig-from a republic into Â£
monarchy, the treaty is ilill in force, be
cause tliebody is still the fame, and has on
ly another chief."
4. "We must however make an excepti
on here, which is, when it appears thai
the prefervatiott of the republican govern
ment w-.s the true cause of the tre.-ty;
ns when two republics enter into an alli
ance, by which they agree to aflift 011 c
another, againll liich as (hall endeavoui
to Iter tlu?ir constitution, and
deprive them of their liberties."
sth. In cafe of doubt, every public treat>
made with a king ought to be deemed real
because, in dubious cales, the king is sup
poled -o a:t ak chief, ai.d for the good ol
the state."
Gih, Hence it follows, that as after the
change of a democracy into a monarch)
the treaty is (till in force, in regard to tilt
new sovereign ; so if the gtvernmcnt.fi on
.1 mo tarchy,becomes a repub.ic, thi. tr&atj
made with the k\"g dues uct expire, unlet:
it was raaiiifeftly personal."
