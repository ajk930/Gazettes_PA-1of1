Vol. I.
TO THE PUBLIC.
THE Editor ps the Rational Gazette
hiving found his proposals for es
tablishing a paper of that kind attended
with all the fcrccefs he could reasonably
expect, considering the ftiort time that
has elapsed since his first acquainting
the public with his design, takes this
opportunity in his frjjt number, briefly
to remind his subscribers, and others,
of the, plan upon which he originally
intended, and still proposes to proceed.
The National Gazette (ball be pub
lished on the, Monday and Thursday
mornings of every week., in the city of
Philadelphia, and sent to the more dis
tant subscribers by the mod ready and
tegular modes of conveyance. Such
persons, resident in the city of Phila
delphia, as incline to become subscri
bers, {hall be supplied early on the
mornings of publication, at their own
houses. The price will be thru
dollars a year ; the first half yearly
payment to be made in three months
from the time of subscribing, and fu
ture payments every lix months.
The paper (hall contain, among other
interesting particulars, the most im
portant foreign intelligence, collected
not only from the French, and
Dutch newspapers _ (a constant and
puntual supply of which has been
engaged) but also from original com
munications, letters, and other papers
to which the Editor may have an op
portunity of recurring for the molt au
thentic information relative to the af
department for domestic new*
will be rendered Â«ftompletc and {*-
tisfactory as bf inserting a
judicious detail of such occurrences as
shall appear worthy the notice of the
public. *""* ~
The most respectful attention {hall
be paid to all decent productions of
entertainment in prose or verse that
may be feat for insertion, as well as to
such political essays as have a tendency
to promote the general interests of the
Union. There will also be inserted
during the sessions of Congress, a brief
History of the Debates and Proceedings
of the Supreme Legislature of the Uni
ted States, executed, it is hoped, in
such a manner as to answer the expec
tations and gratify the curiosity of eve
ry reader.
Persons at a distance who may sub

FeUow-citizens of the Senate, and of (hi
House of Reprefcntatives.
I MEET you, upon the preterit oc
ofton, with the feelings, which arc na
turally inspired by a strong tmpreflior
Df the prolperous lituation of our com
mon country, and by a persuasion equal
ly strong, that the labours of the fcftion.
which has just commenced, will, under
the guidance of a spirit, no less pru
dent than patriotic, ifTue in mcalures
conducive to the stability and increase
of national prolperity.
Numerous as arc the providentia
bleflings which demand our gratefu,
acknowledgments; the abundance wit>
which another year has again rcwardec
the industry of the husbandman, is toe
â mportant to escape recolleaion.
Your own observations, in your re
fpeftive situations. will have fatishcc
vou oftheprogrefltve state of agncul
ture, manufactures, commerce and na
vieation : In tracing their cause., yor
will have remarked, with particulai
pleasure, the happy effects of that re
vtv al ol confidence, public as well a:
privtte, to which the constitution ant
laws of the United States have so emi
nently contributed: And you will have
observed, with no lets interest, new anc
deci&ve proofs of the encrealing rc JP u '
tatior and credit of the nation. But
you,neverthelefs, cannot fail to derive
["atisfaftion from the confirmation ol
theft circumstances, which will bÂ« dis
closed in the several official communi
cations that will be made to you in th(
course of your ,
TÂ«ie rapid fubferiptions to the Bank
of the United Stawa, which completed
the I'um allowed to be fubftnbed in a
single day, is imosi the striking and
pleasing evidences which preftnt them
lelves, not only of confidence in the
government, but of reiource in the com
nuj
% interval of your recess, due
ittention has been paid to the execu
tionof the different objeÂ£U which were
Tpeyally provided for by the laws and
refalutions of the last feilion. .
Among the mod important of these
is the defence and security of the Well
:m frontiers. Tp accpmpliih it on
:hemoft humane principles, was apri
nam wish. â  ,
Accordingly at the fame tune, that
treaties have been provisionally con
cluded, and other proper means used
o attach the wavering, and to confirm
n their friendfhip, the well disposed
ribes of Indiansâeffectual measures
iavÂ« been adopted to make these of a
noftiie defejiption sensible, that a paci
fication was desired upon terms of mo
de tat ion and justice.
<ThÂ«fe mealures having proved utÂ»-
fuccefsful, it became necessary to con
v |>ce the refraaory of the power of
thl United States to puhifll their de
pmdatioiis ; offenfive operations have
dStfor*; bccadirc&jd Â» to be conduc
ed, however, as confidently as poillDltf
with the dictates of humanity. Some
of theft have been crowned with full
success, and others are yet depending.
The expeditions which have been com
pleted, were carried on under the au
thority, and at the expence of the Unit
ed States, by the militia of Kentucky ;
whole enterprise, intrepidjty, and good
conduct, are entitled to peculiar com
mendation. ,
Overtures of pcace are lull cont tnuca
:o the deluded tribes, and considerable
lumbers of ihdividuals belonging to
:liem have lately renounced all further
jppofition, removed from their former
Titrations, and placed themselves under
he immediate p rot eft ion of the United
It is sincerely to be desired, that all
ieed of coertion, in future, may ctafc ;
ind that an intimate intercourse may
Tucceed ; calculated to advance the
liappincfs of the Indians, and to attach
:hem firmly to the United States.
In order to this, it feeir.j necefTiiiy,
That they (hould experience the bene
fits of an impartial dispensation of
Tllat the mode of alienating their knds,
the main source of discontent and
war, (hould be so defined, and regu
lated, as to obviate imposition, and,
as far as may be pra&icable, contro
versy concerning the reality and ex
tent of the alienations which are
made. _ , ,
That commerce with them (hould be
promoted under regulations tending
to secure an equitable deportment
towards them, and that such rational
experiments (hould be made, for im
parting to them the blellings of civil
ization, as may, from time to time,
suit their condition.
That the Executive of the United State:
(hould be enabled to employ th<
means to which the Indians have
been long accustomed, for uniting
their immediate intercfts with th<
preservation of peace;
Andâthat efficacious provision (houlc
be made for infli&ing adequate pe
nalties upon all those, who, by vio-
Numb. i.
lating their rights, shall infringe the
treaties, and endanger the peace of
the Union. i _
A system corresponding with the
mild principles of religion and philan
thropy towards an unenlightened race
of men, whose happiness materially
depends on the conduct of the United
States, would be as honorable to the
National character, as conformable to
the dictates of found policy. , ,
. . The powers specially vested in mm
by the act, laying certain duties on â¢
tilled spirits, which respects the Â£ab
divisions of the districts into surveys,
the Appointment of officers, and the
assignment of compensations, have liko
wilc been carried into effect. In a
natter, in which both material* and
Experience were wanting to guide the
calculation, it will be readily conceiv
ed that there must have been difficulty
in such an adjustment of the rates of
compensation as would conciliate a rem
fonable competency, with a proper re
gard to the limits prescribed by th*
law. It is hoped that the circumspec
tion which has been used will be found
in the result to have secured the last of
the two objects; but it is probable, that
with a view to the fir ft, in fomeisftan
:es a revision of the provision will be
Found adviseable.
The impressions with, which this law
has been received by the community,
have been, upon the whole, fuels as
were to be expected among enlightened
tad well-disposed citizens, from the
propriety ana necessity of the measure.
she novelty, however, of the tax, in
a considerable part of the United States,
and a misconception of some of its pro
visions, have given occasion in parti
cular places to some degree of
tent. But it is satisfactory to knew,
i,m Am Mfmtown yirlrii >Mi {â jirill
Sanations and more just apprehensions
>f the true nature of the law. And I
entertain a full confidence, that it will*
n all, give way to motives which arise
jut of a just sense of duty, and a virtu
jus regard to the public welfare,
If there are any circumstances, in
he law, which consistently with itÂ»
main design, may be so varied as to w
move any well-intentioned objections
hat may happen to exist, it will con
sift with a wife moderation to make the
proper variations. It is desirable, on
ill occasions, to unite with a steady
and firm adherence to constitutional
and necessary acts of government, the
fullest evidence of a disposition, as far
as may be practicable, to consult the
wishes of every part of the community,
md to lay the foundations of the pub
ic administration in the affections of
he people,
Pursuant to the authority contained
in the several acts on that subjectâa
disrict of ten miles square, for the per
manent feat of the government Of the
United States, has been fixed, and an
nounced by proclamation ; which dis
trict will comprehend lands en both
ides of the river Potowmac, and the
owns of Alexandria and George
town. A city has also been laid out
agreeably to a plan which will be plac
id before Congress: And as there is a
prospect favored by the rate of sales
which have already taken place, of am
ple funds for carrying on the necessary
public buildings, there is every expec
ation of their due progress.
The completion of the census of the
inhabitants, for which provision was
made by law, has been duly notified
excepting in one instance, in which
the return has been informal; and an
other, in which it has been omitted or
miscarried) and the returns of the offi
cers who were charged with this duty,
which will be laid before you, will give
you the pleasing assurance, that the pre
sent population of the United States
borders on four millions of persons.
It is proper also to inform you, that
a further loan of two millions and axhalf of florins has been completed in
Holland ; the terms of which are fimi
lar to those of the. one la ft announ

Gentlemen of the Senate.
Visionally concluded with the Chero
kee and Six Nations of Indians, will
be laid before you for your considera
tion and ratification.
Gentleman of the House qf
Representatives,
IN entering upon the discharge or
your Legislative trust. you mud anti
cipate With pleasure,- that many of the
-dilfieulftÂ«s, necessarily incident to the
arrangements of a new government,
'for in 'extinltve country, have been
â¢happily farmounted by the zealous and
'jjuaicious exertions of your predeces
sors in co-operation with the other
branch of the Legislature. The im-
K riant objects which remain to be ac
xiplifhed, will, I am persuaded, be
conducted upon principles equally
comprehensive, ana equally well cal
xulated tor the advancement of the gc
-acral weal.
The time limited for receiving sub
scriptions to the loans proposed the
making provision for the debt of the
â¢United States, having expired, state
ments from the proper department,
will, as soon as possible apprise you of
-the exact result. Enough, however,
-is already known to afford an assurance
*hat the views of that act have been
substantially fulfilled. The subscrip
t ion in the domestic debt of the United
States, has embraced by far the great
ex! .-proportion of that debt ; affording
<at'tnc<mmc time, proof of the general
satisfaction of the public creditors with
the system which has been proposed to
their acceptance, and of the spirit of
Accommodation to the convenience of
the government with which they are
actuated. The subscriptions in the
debts of the respective states, as far as
the provisions of the law have permit
ted, may be said to be yet more gene
ral. The part of the debt of the Unit
ed States which remains unsubscribed,
-will naturally engage your further de
liberations.
, It is particularly pleasing to me to
be able to announce to you, that the
revenues which have been establish
ed, promise to be adequate to their
objects, and may be permitted, if no
unforeseen exigency occurs, to super
sede, for the present , the necessity of
any new burthens upon our constitu
ents.
An object which will claim your
early attention, is a provision for the
current service of the ensuing year, to
gether with such ascertained demands
upon the Treasury, as require to be
immediately discharged, and such ca
sualties as may have arilen in the ex
ecution of the public buiinefs, for
which no specific appropriation may
have yet been made ; of all which, a
proper estimate will be laid before you.
Gentlemen of the Senate and
â â â of the House of Representatives,
I (hall content myself with a gene
ral reference to former communica
tions for feveral objects,upon which the
urgency of other affairs has hitherto
postponed any definitive resolution:â
Their importance will recall them to
your attention ; and I trust that the
progress already made in the most ar
duous arrangements of the government
will, afford you leisure to resume them
with advantage.
There are, however, some of them
of which I cannot forbear a more par
ticular mention âThese are, the Mili-
Haâthe Post-Office and Poft Roadsâ
the MintâWeights and Measures â
a Provision for the sale of the vacant
Lands of the United States.
The first is certainly an object of pri
mary importance, whether viewed in
reference to the national security, to
the satisfaction of the community, or
to the preservation of order. In con
nection with this, the establishment of
-competent magazines and arsenals, and
the fortification of such places as are
peculiarly important and vulnerable
naturally present themselves to con
sideration. The safety of the United
States, under divine protection, ought
to reft on the basis of systematic and lb
-lid arrangements ; exposed as little as
po (libit to the hazards of fortuitous
circumstances.
The importance of the post office,
ana post roads, on a plan inssciently
liberal and comprehensive, as they res
.pest the expedition, safety and facility
of is encreased by the
instrumentality in tiiffcfTing a know- '
ledge of the laws and procÃ¨dings of the
government; which, while It contri
butes to the security of the people,
serves also to guard them against the
effects of misrepresentstion and mifcon-.'
ccjjtion. Ihe eftablifhinent of addi
tional cross-posts, especially to some of
the important points in the western and
northern parts of the Union, cannot
fail to be of material utility.
The disorders in the existing currrti- 1
cy, and especially the scarcity of small!.
change, a scarcity so peculiarly distress
ing to the poorer classes, strongly re
commend the carrying into immediate
effeftthe resolution already entered in
to conccrning the eftabliftiment of a
mint. Meafurcs ha\'e been taken pur
luant to that resolution for procuring
some of the most necessary artists, to
gether with the necessary apparatus.
An uniformity in the weights and
meafurcs of the country is among the
important objects submitted to you by
the eonftitution, and if it can be deri
ved from a standard at once invariable
and univcrfal. must be no less honora
ble to the public councils than condu
cive to the public convenience.
A provision for the sale of the vacant
lands of the United States, is particu
larly urged, amongother reasons, by the
important contidcrations, that they are
pledged as a fund for reimbursing the
public debtthat if timely and judi
cioufiy applied they may save the ne
ccfTity of burthening our citizens with
new taxes for the extinguifhmcnt of the
principal ; and that being free to dif
chargc the principal, but in a limited
proportion, no opportunity ought to
be loft for availine the public of its
right.

with him, a" few Weeks (inoe. He is
commonly callad James. Certificates
can be had from gentlemen of charac
ter to the following purpose, as'l had
it from them: James was born in Charles
county, Maryland, about the year >741,
of a.black negro mother. His father
was-*.while man, as James fays, and as
all belief*. His birth was at Ignatius
Bowman's, and he fuceeflively belong
ed' folKfftt'd'Mr. 1 Sowman, a William
Bowrrtan, "a Mr. Hancock, Thomas
Ifcrpevctu, Col. William Hopewell,
arid John Blood fworth, where he is
at ptefcMt. He was of a black or very
darkvtolatto colour tiH he was about
15 ye*Tsof age,tvfaen fomc white spots
bnhis (kin, and which have
line* gradually increased; Co that at
this time his (kin is entirely white from
head to foot, excepting a few brown
fpelka, like molca, *nd some blotches
of a dark mulatto colour on his cheek
bones. Concurring in the above par
ticulars, James adds of himfelf, that he
was bom with some whits locks as hair
on Ms head, which Hill remain. That
he had a Child, which is in Charloa
withfuch white spots of
hair on his head.
Itk/alflt wfeH ascertained, by num
ber* with whop* I converged in the
neighborhood of James, that from their
own knowledge, abow fixfeen years
ago, ho hichaomnore white on him than
there is nowwf black. He has a negro
wifcSnd IfcVeral children by her, now
living. Thcfe are all black as negroes
commoply are. But he knows not the
condition of the obild he left in Charles
county fÂ»whether there has commenc
ed irty tfhSnge in the colour of his skin,
as the spots in the hair might promiie.
Jarries is about fifty years old, his
hair Is black, with a few white spots
short and much curled (more like a
mulatto's than a negro's); the white
spots ca his head, and two while spots
of hair on his chin, give him an odd

Ejvrjft of a letter from dated dug. 20.
Â«Â« Notwithstanding whit may be supposed ilia
ardent desire of the Emprelj of Rufiia, it dors
not appear that under her auspices the Rulhan
armies will eÂ»er become cunquerori of Conltan
tinople, as threatened. On the contrary, there
is every profpett of a speedy peace takin/ place
between the Aultrians, Ruffians, and Ottomans.
Tbe hopes of a coupler-revolution in France are
more and moieon tbe decline, and although the
King vf Sardinia is making immense warlike
preparations in favour of supporting the a:ifto
cratic exiles from France, and reftoiing the old
dcfpotic government, the Emperor of Germany
has declined giving them any cA'eAual afiiftancej
It may realonably be concluded therefore, that
the powers of Europe will either not intermeddle
at .11 in the affairs of France, or if they do,
it will be by a negociatiou rather than by violent
measures."
It having been fuggc/lcd to tbe Editor of
tbe National Gaxette that Wednesdays and Sa
turdays are tbe moji frequent days of nnufpsptr
publications in this lApital, be bas on tbst account
varied a little from his original flan, atd changed
tit days of pstblijbing to Monday and Thursday.
Poetical Audkiss to the Public of tbe
Ukitxo States.
THIS age is so fertile of mighty events
That people complain, w.th feme rcafon,
no doubt;
Besides the time 1011, and betides the cxpence,
With reading the papeis they're fairly worn out j
The past is no longer an object of care,
The present consumes all the time they can
/pareâ l
Thus rcafons the reader, but dill he reads on,
With his pence and his paper unwilling to part,
He fees the world pa fling, men going and gone,
Some riding In coaches, and some in a cart : (
For a peep at the farce a fubfeription he'll
give 5
Revolutions nut happenâthat Printers may
live*
For a (hare of your favor we aim with the reftâ
To enliven the scene we'll exert all out fltill ;
What we have to impart xhall be some of the

And Multum in Parnro our text*-<lf yon will :
Since we never admitted aclaofe in our Creed
That the greatest employment of life isâ
to read.
The King of the French, and the Queen of the
North
At the head of tbe play for the season we find t
From tbe spark that we kindled a flame has
gone forth
To expand thro' the world and enlighten man
kind I '
With a code of new doftiines the aniverfir
rings,
And Thomas il preaching strange feraions to
kings.
Thns launch'd as we are on the ocean of niws,
In hopes that your pleafureour pains will repay,
All boneft endeavours the author will use
To furnifli a feall for the grave and the gay (
At least he'll eflay such a track to pursue
That the world Jhall approveâand bis news

relative to the presentation of the Ccnftiturional
Chart to the Kfeg, and refpe&ing the liberty
which itia neced'ary to grant to the Monarch, and
the forms and ceremonies which ate to be observ
ed on this occa6on.
Befjre he read bis decree, tbe orator made a
long speech which abounded much lef# with ar
gument and found eloquence, than with high
founding bombast. The nation, (fÂ»yÂ« he) ex
asperated at the risks which you have run, and
(atisfied wich.your condud, awaked like a fove

dangers vanished.
He then read, as spokesman for the Commit

articles.
Art. I. " A deputation (hall be appointed to
present the conltitutional adl to the King for
his acceptance.
a. " The King fta!l be requested to give such

3. " If tbe King accede to the wiftes of the

Aall folertinly pronounce in presence of the Na

Premutation of tbe Confutation to the King, for
bit acceptance.
The Grand Constitutional Chart is at length
finiihed, and was on Saturday last presented to
the King f who received it with a countenance
in which much outward fatisfadion was depi&ed.
The members met in the hall of the Assembly
at fix o'clock in the evening, but it was half
paft tight before everv thing was ready.
M. Vernier, the President, then intimated,
(hat he had waited on the King, and announced
their intentions, and that his Majesty was read)
to receive them.
On this the depuration moved on towards the
palace of the Thuillertes, between a double row
of national guards, flambeaux preceding, follow
ing, and accompanying them, and martial ma
fic ftrikinj up and continuing during the proces
sion.
[Here follow t a lift of tbe membert empowered
by tbe Afjembly, to present tbe new Confiituttom to
LouitXVl.]
Having arrived at the palace, the deputation
were immediately utbeied into the Grand Coun

was seated on a throne, surrounded by his Mi I
' nifters, and a great number of other persons of J
Â» dsÂ£in&ion.
M. Thouret then advanced, tnd fpske at so!

LONDON, Sept. 6.
Declaration of the Emperor; in conjunction
with the Courts of Berlin, London, Mad
rid, Turin, Naples and Peter/burgh.
" The underficned are ordered by
their refpe&ive sovereigns to mafec
known the following :
" That notwithstanding the glaring
force and violence whichboth preced
ed and Succeeded the a&s of consent
drawn from the King of France to the
decrees of the National Assembly, yet
they had with-held their opinions as
to the free will of hi* Christian Maief
ty in the consent above mentioned, but
that the attempt made by that Monarch
to obtain his freedom was an undoubt
ed proof that both his religion and his
will, had been violently forced, and
that the formal arreftine of the King,
Queen, Daaphin and Madame Eliza
beth, occasions grounded anxiety as to
the further views of the oppoftng party.
"That the before named Sovereigns
can no longer forbear cxpre fling their
feelings, and declaring the resolutions
which thev have been induced to take
in the prelent Situation of affairs, and
which the honour of their crowns, the
ties of friendfhip, and the earned wish
for the good order and peace of Eu
rope, require of them, and they have
charged the undersigned Ministers to
declare in theirnames,
" i ft. That they look upon the cause
of the King of France as their own;
that they require that that Prince and
his family be immediately set at liberty,
and free to go where they please, and
to restore to his Majesty that sacred
honour and fubmiflion due from a peo
ple to their Sovereign by all laws of
nature and civil society.
" 2dly, That the Sovereigns will
unite to oppose and revenge any fur
ther attempts against the security of the
persons, or the honor of the King,
Queen, and any of the Royal Family.
"jdly, That they will not acknow
ledge any other constitution as legal in
France but what has the unequivocal
approbation of the kine, given when
he is at full liberty to att as he pleases.
"4thly, Anditnofuch legil con di
lution is fettled, they will jointly use
every means to put an end to that spi
rit of anarchy and confufion so contra
ry to the regularity and good order
which it is the duty of all governments
to cherish and support."

Last Wednelday, after a full debate,
the House of Representatives repealed
the Certificate Law, passed last May,
by a large majority of votes. The fate
of the bill in the Council was doubt
fill.
Applications are making to the Le
gislature for a purchaft of the Weftem
Lands belonging to the State, so that
the State may now reap some benefit
from them. But it is feared that the
fame mad policy, which has hitherto
prevented the falc of them, will govern
the legislature ; and that under pre
tence of holding them till they rife ia
value, they will be held till the rage
for fpcculation is over, till the monicd
men haV*vcfted their money in other
lands or enterprizes, and then a few
deiigning men will have an Opportu
nity of purthaftng theie lands cheap.
