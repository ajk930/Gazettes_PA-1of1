\jVe are requcjled to xnftrt, from the Inde
pendent Gazetteer, the following piece,
addrefftd to the YEOMANRY of the
United Statcs.~\
176kI 76k a government to interfere in the
occupations, or in the private ac
tion.'. of citizens, where such actions are
not injurious to the community, is not
only unjust and impolitic, but is highly
dangerous to the liberties of the peo
ple. All partial regulations tend to
crease separate interests in focicty, and
therefore occasion jealousy and diffenti
on among citizens, whose true interest
con fills in being united. On this
fubjeÂ£t the sentiments of the great bo
dy of the people in the United States
were clearly expressed during the ardu
ous contest to establish their liberties :
The constitutions of the several Hates,
formed during that period of public
animation and attention, manifeft the
strongest disapprobation of monopolies
and > exclusive privileges. Although
these just and honorable sentiments
hava been lately fuppretled by the in
tluei- o of ambition and avarice, yet
they are not extinct, but will re-apye*r
with an additional lustre, reflc&ed from
the glorious revolution of France.
The Americans will adopt the poli
tical principles of that enlightened peo
ple, and like them will consider, that
the prosperity and happiness of citizens
conjhtutcs the realJlrengtkoj nations. If,
under a vague undefined idea of sup
porting the general welfare, Congress
is permitted to enact partial laws in fa
vor of a few wealthy individuals, and
to grant them excluhve privileges in any
occupation in which their unbounded
avarice may prompt them to engage,
such regulations will inevitably destroy
the infant matiufaftures of our country,
and will conlign the uletul an d relpeftu
ble citizens personally engaged in them
to contempt and ruin. All confidcnce
of procuring an honorable support from
any mechanic or manufa&uring employ
being at an end, no citizen will think of
giving seven years of the prime of his
life to acquire the knowledge of any
profefTion in which he may be fupplant
sd by a junto of monied men, under the
immediate patronage and protetlion of
joveinment. Whatever may be the
plauiible pretext of such inflitutions.
they always promote the opprelfive and
injurious drudgery of the manufaftur
srs, and the indolent luxury of the
principals.
Men educated in a profefuorl which
exists by the indiscriminate defcnce of
right and wrong, will naturally support
their opinions with all the art and so
phistry of acute logicians ; but rea
soning in proportion as it extends and
becomes complicated, does not owe
its triumph always to truth ; mental
fatigue, or implicit faith, frequently
Succeeds in procuring it admirers. A
variety of stratagems may be made use
of to deceive the people, but a miniftct
who knows nothing more, will nevei
lay the foundation of a great empire ;
the fabric raised by his duplicity and ex
travagance, mud fall and bury its sup
porters in its ruins.
The fucccfs of American manufac
tures will not depend on financial cal
culations, or legislative interference,
but on the patronage and encouragemeni

they may receive from patriotic citi-
I ens. It is certain that the powerful
Imd encreafing mercantile intcreft, lias
always suggested doubts refpe6ting the
propriety of giving encouragement to
American artilts and manufacturers.
As agents, it is the immediate interelk
of the merchants that every raw materi
al, and every manufactured article,
should pass through their hands : But
no real citizen ever had a doubt of the
expediency of every independent com
monwealth being as much as polTiblc
supplied within itfelf with all things
necefl'ary or ufeful in common life. A
chain does not derive its strength and
utility from being composed of a few
heavy links, and the remainder weak
and ill conditioned, but from every link
being as much as poflible of equal pow
er. The fame takes place in civil soci
ety ; a state is rendered more refpefta
ble and powerful by the prolperity of
all its citizens, than by the over-grown
wealth of the few. By giving ufeful
Employment and comfortable support to
the weakest and moll miserable fellow- â  ,
citizen, you promote your own confe-'.>
quence and fafety ; therefore, duty as
well as intsreft oblige the members of
the fame society to aflift each other.
Those who use foreign manufactures, in
preference to such as may be procured
in their own country, receive protecti
on from the government, of which they
are members, without complying with
their duty in supporting its citizensâ
An injustice that in its increase must be
theruiuofany Commonwealth. This
principle, however, should be carried
no further than is confident with the
real proiperity of the state, as conned
sd with-the fwU employment, the hap
piness and independence of all its citi
zens.
We ought not to desire the cftablifh
ment of any kind of manufacture in our
country, which cannot support itfelf,
without government granting to its a-*
gents, bounties, premiums, and a vari
ety of exclusive privileges, in violation
of the rights of the people,

On the FUNDING SYSTEM.
HAVING made some observationÂ» or
the perpetual system of taxation which
has been fixed like a mill stone around the
necks e>f us and our posterity, and havinc
-raced its cause to the funding system, lei
us now proceed to take a general view o(
itseffeftsâ And we shall, inthe firllplp.ee
behold hosts of foreign and domestic (pecu
lators living in foreign countries, or withii
the purlieus of the treafury,drawing a con
tain tribute from the mass of tile people
who, living remote from scenes of fpecula
ion, have neither had time 01- opportuni
â y to acquire this species of property : bul
~ m the contrary have been plundered 01
:liofe which they so dearly earned by gree
ly Ipeculators, to whose artifices they have
jeen wantonly exposed, by the sudden and
urreptitious manner in which the fundins
yftem was palmed on them. It is not here
ifferted thai this was the result of a deei:
aid scheme of speculation ; the etfefts flow
?ver have been the fame, and have proved
tqually Unjust and pernicious. It is a no
orious fact that the unfufpefting soldier ha?
>ecome a prey to the knowing (peculator,
md that the certificates which in times of
lifficulty and danger, were received as cadi
or personal services, have been purchased
ip at four and fix pence in the pound ; and
>y a variety of arts have been since ftimu
ated in the hands of the purchaferr to
â¢wenty-five (hillings â¢ a cirtumftance the
nore aggravating when it is conlidered that
he people who have been thus manoeuv
red, are now obliged 10 supply the taxes by
.vhich the evidences of their pad services,
jf which they have been so fhamefully plun
dered, have been thus raised in the hands of
oreign 8c domestic (peculators to five Ihil
ings in the pound above their nominal va
ue.
It has been hinted at in more ways than
ine, that some of our representatives, their
riends and agents, have had a share in the
profitable speculations which ensued from
he funding system ; while the great temp
tation they were exposed to by the facility
if purchasing certificates, and the extraor
dinary exertions they have since made to
aife them in value, are circumstances
which give a colouring to the fuppolition
-hat cannot fail making some impreflion on
the molt unsuspicious mind. They had no
thing to do but purchase at four and six
pence in the pound; vote for the funding
system, the import, and exrife laws ; make
the one permanent,and mortgage the other;
for the payment, & their bundles of paper,
formerly the representatives of the loldier,
and the patriot's services, but now of their
poverty and negleÂ£ted Hate, become valua
ble property in the speculators hands. To
answer these ends have our ears been din
ned with the prostituted cries of public
faith, national honour, and unviolated con
tracts; or how happened it that these high
founding terms, slept for a term of years,
when alone they could have been used with
propriety, when justice, gratitude, policy,
md every obligation, moral as well as poli
tical, required them in favour of a merito
"ious class of citizens, whose health and for
ties have been ruined by extraordinary
:xertions to serve their country.
But let the Secretary of the Treasury
md his adherents beware how far they
proceed in their fuccelsful attempts to in
:reafe the national debt, and add to the
jurthens of the people, by loans, funding
yftems, and perpetual taxes ; let them re
member, that altho' the republican jealou
y of the people may sleep for a time, that it
s not extinit, and that when they begin to
eel the prefiure of opprellive and perpetual
axes, and the numerous impoiitions which
it tend them, that they may, by one exer
tion, overturn that complicated fabric the
unding system, the cause of all these evils,
snd bury the enormous fortuneswhich have
3een made under it in its ruins. It would
>e well for them to reflea that altho' them
elves may have been led on from mea
ure to measure by an artful combination
)f principles, not in their nature connected
.vith each other, and have been induced to
uftify one evil and unconstitutional act by
1 preceding! one llill worse, that the peo
ple will form an opinion of these measures
jy their individual merits, and not follow
heir financier in his labyrinth of fophifticai
-eafoning. Let them further reflect that
lowever the immense profits which have
jeen made by these fyfteins may cafl a mill
aef ore the eyes of those who are interefled.
md obtain them the applaufc and adulati
on ot a few greedy speculators hovering a
jout the treasury, that the great body ol
:he people, whose interelts will be affectei
n a different manner, may be as prejudict i
igainft these speculating measures, as them
"elves have been partial in their favour.
1 hey may perhaps think they could havt
Deen better employed in counteracting tht
injurious restraints imposed on the product
afthe country by the severe navigation law
of Europe, particularly of Great Britain
that they should not have fullered them t(
continue pouring in their fuperfluous luxu
ries without limitation, while even oui
grain and other valuable productions thi
fruits 01 hard labour, are either not admit
ted into their ports, or subjeCted to the mof
partial and limited conditions.
L If they have done a single act whose ob
ieft was,to promote the interest of theyeo
tnanry of the United States, by securing t<
:hem better markets for the fruits of theii
nduftry, let it be made known ; that like ;
jleain of light, it may shine through th<
lark catalogue of imports, excises, loans
runds, banks and bounties ; about whicl
:hey liave been so exceedingly busy for thÂ»
profefled purpose of rising stock. A gree
:iinefs for revenue and a desire to perpetu
ite and fecureit, to speculators in the pub
lic funds, has marked all their proceedings
n this favourite object they have entirely
oft fight of the agricultural interelts : fc
much so with regard to those, who fron
heir locality & distance from a market, ar<
jbliged to convert their grain into arden
pints,that they have actually facrificed thei
nterefts, by means of an excise to the ipe
uilators in that part of the funding fyfteir
:alled the afiumption, of which the excifi
san immediate offspring. In this inftancc
t might be shown that this greediness foi
â¢e venue has led them so far from the line o:
:heirduty, as to facrifice the interests o!
:he farmer and distiller of whisky in the
United States, to the sugar planter and dif
:iller of rum in the Weft-Indies.
It is not here afTerted that agriculture,
ind consequently commerce, have not ii
"ome degree flourifhed for two years part,
nit this has arisen from causes entirely un
.onneCted with the general government, or
iny of its measures. The dearths, the
.vars, the dilfentions, and the revolutions
vhich have convulled Europe within the
>eriod mentioned, have been the real cauf
;s, that have given a temporary stimulus to
)ur agriculture and commerce ; hence the
lemand for our produce has been so great,
is to raise wheat to 12/6 in the bushel; and
â¢his again has ftimtilated the farmer to en
-reafe his exertions, and at the fame time
ias supplied him with the means of doing
t fuccefsfully.
Advantage has been taken of these fortu
tous circumstances, and with great fuc
.efs, to reconcile some people to measures
Â»vhich are palpably wrong. But when the
iffairs of Europe become fettled into a
:alm, and their own crops are again fuffici
;nt to supply their wants; and when, in
:onfequence of these events, the produce of
Jiis country shall be reduced to its former
'alue, for want of purchaiers to take it oft
Jtir hands, and the farmer meets no encou
agement to pursue with vigor his ufeful
occupation, we /hall then fee agriculture
languishing, and the yeomanry of the Uni
ted States dwindling into infignificance, be
cause in addition to all the difadvantaees
they will labour under for want of markets
to dispose of the fruits of their industry, the
little surplus that will remain to them,
\yhich ought to be appropriated to keep up
the neceflary improvements of their farms,
will be drained away by heavy taxes to sup
port the funding system, and supply the
wants of an expeniive government. The
merchant also, when from the fame causes,
he finds the balance of trade continually a
gainst him, will soon feel the ill effects of
paying heavy duties into the treasury to
lupport the encreafing wants of govern
ment, and to supply the demands of public
creditors. In short every class of citizens,
except those immediately engaged in fpecu
[ation, _or in adminiftring the public af
fairs, will feel the dire effects of a languiih
ng commerce, and a declining agriculture
mended with encreaftng burthens. When
â¢ve consider the scattered situation of the
People of the United States over an immense
:erritory, we shall find that this system of
Perpetual taxation to support a public debt |
jy paying the interest only, will be pree
iant with every mifchief. Because, added
0 the annual interest which will accrue
here will be an expenfire civil lift, all of
ivhich mtift be supplied by taxes drawn from
he most extreme parts of the union to fup
'!y the wants and extravagance of a few
hones living at the feat of government, or
a the large maritime towns. Evils which
fill be doubly pernicious, because they vi ill
leprefs the great body of yeomanry who
ire the ornament & support of their coun
:ry ; and serve to nurse up an aristocracy,
ivho will be the willing tools to undermine
tnd deltroy our free republics.

On the INDIAN WAR.
the prcfent confiitution of the
t? United States ceased to be a fubjeft of
nvefligation, by being adopted and put in ope
â¢ation, those who had opposed its adoption
without considerable alterations, manifeflcd
heir patriotism, good sense and love of order,
JV a prompt acquiescence in the decision of their
rountry, and concurrence in the execution of
his confiitution according to its genuine princi
ales. Several adventitious circumflances com
3ined to bless the country with a full gale of
prosperity under its earliest operations. Almost
1 perfect as to political controversy took
n cc - * complaint was to be heard except
;rom lome of those ardent spirits, who were ac
uated by a warm and inconsiderate zeal in pro
curing the adoption of this government, and
who expefled more happiness from it, than any
loimof government can produce; these were
3f course greatly dilappointed v and were the
hilt and loudefl in complaining of wages, grants,
See. 1 hole, on the contrary, who were prompt
- to oppose the adoption of the government,
:10m a lerious apprehension that their liberties
would be endangered by its establishment, ha
vingindulged their fears rather than their hopes,
heir duappointments were of a more agreeable
jind, and therefore much of their iealoufy fub
lded. '
1 hefe partial murmurs arising from the inevit
-1 confcquerice of the chimerical expectations
which were !o fondly chenfhed by the former
elcription persons, were of transient con
muance, and gave way to the sober reflections
Dt reaion.
But the misfortune of the Indian war, the in
rcalcd exposure of an extensive frontier to the
ncuihons of the savages, and the extraordinary
-xpence of defending it, have produced nor
Tiercly popular, clamour, but serious and nearly
lniverfal difcentent, and advantage has been ta
<en of this diipofition of the public mind, to
nake improper and in some instances indecent
ittacks upon adminiflration. Even the boafled
md unexampled success of the complex fund
nglyllem is not without its evils, and has had
10 imall share in souring the community.
My principal object is not to advocate the ad
nin IH ration in the military department, aitho*
I believe the difaileis of the late campaign are
lot wholly imputable to that quarter, but may
)e traced to a higher source. As far as I was
icquainted, which was pretty generally, want
jf success last campaign was no surprize, as it
was not expeaed. However the completeness
Jf the defeat and the magnitude of the slaughter
would have occasioned aflonifhment under any
irrangement. Nor is it my deGgn formally to
ittack the funding system. I am of opinion t
hat the public ought to make provision forthe
layment of its debts, with the greatest pun&u
ilitv and dispatch.
My intention is to examine more particularly
nto the condua of Congress itfelf. It lays con
litutionally with the legislature of the union, to
jriginate the national bufinels, and therefore it
s here our invclligations ought to begin.
Here then we have to regret the inefficient
neafures adopted for bringing the Indian war to
1 speedy and honorable issue. Had there been
1 iecond regiment raised and put under the com
mand of General Harmar previously to his ex
pedition, it would have been in his power to
have chosen his time of going out, to have
srected forts and (food his ground when out.â
He would have taken the Indians unprepar-and uncombined, and in all probability an im
mediate peace would have been the consequence,
Whilst the British hold theweftem polls, anc
their traders (and perhaps others) supply and sti
mulate thefavages to go to war, with lo exten
five and expoted a frontier liable to their attacks
and even the friendly Indians in out neighbor
hood Handing in need of conflant prote&ion
who could, with any truth or reason have said
that 2000 soldiers, properly organized and dif
ciplined, would have been too much, or tha
they would have been dangerous to the libertie:
of so extensive a territory, inhabited by a people
so well informed, so independent and enterpri
zing. I said that our own extensive frontier, a:
well as the friendly Indians in our neighborhood,
even in time of peace, fiand in needof piotettion
Conflant experience and the nature 01 the cafe
convince us of the truth of this.
Whilst the Indians are under so inefficient ;
government; whilst they are fupphed by, anc
under the influence of traders inimical to us :
whilst the memory of former injuries stimulate:
the violent and ungovernable individuals of botl
the Indians and the United States, to embrace
opportunities of revenge ; whilst the Indians ex
perience that the sure way of getting valuable
presents from us is to kill a number of people
thus spreading a general terror in order to r nde
anew treaty, and perhaps a journey to Philadel
phia to enjoy the luxuries ofihe capital, necelfa
ry ; and whilst the numerous temptations whicl
are held out to their lawless rapacity by the emi
grants descending the western waters for Ken
tucky and other diftrifts, with all their propert;
colleited in a boat, and which fall an easy pre;
to the savage free-booteis, and afford them mori
property, with scarcely any risk, in one season
than they would receive from us at treaiv
1 fay, whilst these unpropitious circiimftance
continue, a permanent foice of at least two re
giments will be neceffaiv for our proteflion.
It is painful to refleit how this business ha
been condu&ed. Without a law, 01 any lega
means of compelling the service of the militia
they were called upon late in the season to gc
on an expedition so distant that it could not be
accomplilhed in the time limited by the state
laws for a tour of militia service, confequentl)
the greater pa it of them refufed to go, and the
few who did go were very badly armed, 01
etherwife equipped for the service. Their lega
term was expired before the objeit of the ex
pedition was accomplilhed, so that if Genera
Harmer had succeeded according to our mof
sanguine wishes, he must have retreated with al
moil equal precipitation as if he had been de
feated. Certainly such a plan of conduit wa
merely calculated to irritate end combine the
savages to wreak their vengeance on afarextend
ed exposed frontier. Such were the apprehen
sions of the people on the frontiers ; those higl
in government deemed their feacÂ»_grÂ«afcsiÂ»Â«hai
their danger, but time and dear-bought expert
ence have convinced ibem of the contrary.
Another evil effeif of this improvident plai
was the militia being discharged in the wilder
ness without getting the trifling pittance of pa;
to which they were entitled. In consequence o
which many of them were delayed on their re
turn from Kentucky, and were afterwards killee
by the way coming up the river; nineteen were
killed in one company.
But, fay fonie writers, the fault was in admi
mflration, as the expedition was not necessary
and was provoking a war. Thevmuft have beer
inattentive indeed who did not know that the
Indian war on that quarter had not ceased wher
peace was made with the Britilh. That robbe
lies on the Ohio, with the mof
shocking murders, were continually perpetra
ting. From the frontier of Pennsylvania dowt
the Ohio, fear and devastation had their annua
reign ; in fonie instances Pennsylvania was pene
trated, and the blood of the peaceable inhabi
tants mingled with their haiveft. It is wet
known that the one regiment, altho' always acl
ing on the defenfive, was marched from ftatior
to flation, and scattered along an immenle dis
tance to afford all poflible protection. The
peoplea!fo made great and oppreflive exertion!
for theirown defence.
When things were in this distressing si I nation,
the old Congress were not poflfeffed of fufficieni
fifcal refourccs even to pay the one regiment,
orto difchargc the expences of the civil lift.â
To enable government to afford protection anc
to do juflice were the motives which influenced
the community to organize anew their nationa 1
conllitution. When the new Congrels founc
itfclf vested with the power of the purse and the
fwordin the most ample manner; when the re
fpeflive slates were constitutionally divested ol
both power and means for adequate military
operations; and when the new Congress was in
partcompofed of a great many valuable member!
who had been in the old, surely neither igno
rance of the danger and distress of the frontier
inhabitants, nor want of power and resources,
could be pretended. Thus favorably circum
flanced, and loudly call'd upon for efficient ar
rangements, what was their conduit p Why a
short law was pasTed empowering the Prefideni
to order out the militia, without providing sot
either organizing, &c. the militia so draughted,
or considering that fonie of the slates had no mi
litia law exifling, or giving authority to compel
the obedience of those thathad militia laws, or
without giving suitable encouragement to go out.
Who could expect men to undertake a service
at three dollars a month, wheiein every article
they had to purchase must be obtained fiom the
contractor at three or four times the usual price,
and where the ordinary piice of labor was from
ftven to eight dollars per month.
Equal protection to the citizens is the firfl
iuty of a government, it is that on whicli
the right of lubjection and obedience is founded,
And to fay the leall of it, Congress did not pay
lufficicnt attention to the protection of tholeci
:izens who were exposed to the horrors of lavage
boflility and rapacity. The President was in
deed required to adiriinifler protection, withou
Jung veiled with adequate means for that pur
jofe.
The result was answerable to the provision

ion, the wellern frontier of Pennsylvania wa:
lttacked for near 150 miles of circuitous extent,
ind the miserable inhabi.ants who escaped till

lad been ruined by the tormer war, were bu
u(l got back to their long delolated habitation:
n extreme poverty, and were beginning to rnakt
1 living, when they are thus again reduced tc
lie greatest dillrels.
II those who meanly insult the fuffetings o
:hefe devoted people, by charging ihem witl
provoking the Indians to war, were but to takt
j transient view ol their situation; if they confi
tiered how licredible it is that a people thus ex
poled could wilh to lliinulate an Indian war, b)
which they would be the leverell lutlerers, or 1
they were acquainted with the friendly conduc

would reflect with remorle on their injustice ant

been used by members of Congrels, 1 wilh lucl
to reflett that the blood that has been Ihed botl
3f our own people and the Indians, since th<
general government has been veiled with fuliici
:nt powers to prevent it, lays in the full inllancf

That fotne inllances of provocation have beer

hat it was done by any ol thelettlers 111 the well

jf mcenfed savages. A revengetul murdei
:ommitted in Northumberland county about twe
.rears ago waÂ» atoned for to the fatisfattion ot the
Indians by the government of Pennsylvania, anc
iccordingly no retaliation has taken place ir
:hat]county on the part ot'the Indians. The per
petrators of this murder have fled the Hate, ont
person who was present at it but not aÂ£tually
:oncerned in it, was tried and acquitted. S(uc<
he Indians were killed at Beaver Creek, b)
Bready and others, wkich tranlaftion occafionec

s ascertained that these very Indians upon whoir

mcd were peaceable and friendly, were making
ivar upon us previoully to the attack made upor

jy the lureft of all proofs, viz. the return of tlx
prisoners whom they had taken before that time
nut alas how few were luffered to return ! Th<

many of thole are devoted to lulfer, who liavi
jeen tenderly raised and carefully -educated, ant

jf the savages.
Is it true that even members of Congress hav<
said that if the Indians had orators, nevvl'pape

April 5, 1792.
On Monday lafl the chiefs of the five
Indian nations, now in this city, met the
governor of the state in the council cham
ber, and returned a formal answer to his
address delivered to them in the fame place
;on the 26th of March. Two of the chiefs
only spoke 011 this occasion, viz. Sagoye
| watha, or Red- Jacket, and Agwelondong
was, or Good Peter.âBoth these speech
( es contained their expreflions of goo . will
I and wishes for a continuance of peace with
I the people of the United States, end a
| treaty of f>;end(hip and alliance; in fV>r
| warding which, however, it was intimated
j that their nations were not completely un
animous, some of their young men not
having attended the late councils.âThe
governor, in reply congratulated them up
on the profpeft of a speedy alliance, and a
mutual exchange of good offices between
the inhabitants of the United States and
the Indians of the five nations.
Perfectly risible, in one refpeft, was a
late address to the Indian chiefs in this
city, delivered in a certain aflembly. Ev
ery time they were mentioned it was un
der the pompous appellation of Princes â
It is well known that all the tribes of the
more northern parts of this continent are,
I in reality, republicans ratlur than aristo
crats or monarchy men. Calling our taw
ny visitors Princes (in the common accepta
tion of the word) is a little like the mistake
of Lord Hawkefbury's ploughmanâwho
having brought abafket of fine apples to
his Lordship's house in tÂ»wn, left them
(landing in an exposed entry till he could
find the great man. In the interim, the
were mangled and destroyed by two
fine drelTed monkies, belonging to the
house. The countryman, to excuse him
felf when the nobleman appeared, whined
out, / did indeed bring the apples, my lord but they
were eaten up by the two young gentlemen, your ions.
" The National company of comedians, so cal
led, (Jaysa Paris paper) who had hereto
fore been always reckoned amongst the
dregs of the community, but have been re
cently ereÂ£ted into something like a poli
tical existence, by the liberalitv of the na
tional assembly, seem already to have for
got their benefactors. Before the revo
lution, like the vilest and mod loathsome
of animals, they were forbidden the rites
of burial with other citizens, ; and their
bodies, when dead, were thrown into
drains and dung-heaps, there to rot with
other base, bestial carcases to whom no
refpeft was due, but now, forfooth. wh.n
they are advanced to the honorable rank of
citizens, they begin already to fall in with
the arirtocratic faction, and aft'eft to ex
hibit on the stage only thoie pieces which
have been calculated to idolize royalty,
fuchas Gaflon and Bayard, Athaliah, the Chafe

Incredible a s it may appear, it is neverthi
lefs an abfblute fact, that all the world
does not know where every merchant lives,
Witness ! On Friday evening I ast,
a r rench gentleman had to enquire at per
haps twenty ditferent places, without
meeting any one person, who could direst
him where to find a certain very respec
table aflociation of merchants in this city.
Every one could indeed tell him what fliips
they own, and what they have to fell,â
because all this is told in the newfpape^s:
but as to their place of abode, âthat, net
being designated in their advertisements,
might as well have been in the moon.
Now if our citizens are so fhamefully neg
ligent, as not to cram their pocket-boo&s
(lor the benefit ol enquiring ftraugers)
with memorandums of the names and
dwelling places, even of capital wholesale
merchants, how mull puny retailers hope
to tare ? âQuere, therefore, whether it
would be nmifs in merchants and fliop
keepers, although known to all the world,
to inform nevertheless the rejl of the world
where they live, especially as the Printers
do not charge' one farthing more for an
advertisement delignating the street and
house, than tor another, which does not
tell, whether the person lives in Philadel
phia, Canton, or Constantinople.
The States of Holland have made over
tures fbr an alliance with the House of
Austria. How these propositions will suc
ceed does not yet seem to be certainly
known in } ur ipe, as it is thought the F'm

an alliance. Holland, itisfaicl, has become
extremely weak from her being obliged to
fend home the j6oo German troops that
garrisoned her ports, and fending out the
tiovver of the national troops to crush
the growing ipirit of revolt in the poflef

Lieutenant furrier, who was captured by the

and fÂ«eing death inevitable if he attempted fur

protected it fiom the vindictive madnefi of their
companions. After the engagement they thought
of conveying him to the scene where the savages
were revelling over their spoils ; but firft, one of
them took the precaution of paying a visit to the
camp to the vidors, and feeing trfem much in
toxicated took him to the tents of their particular

From the American Daily Advertijer of March 31.
Notwithstanding ail the foiemr
frenzy which appeared in the piece [in the
National Gazette of Monday last] under the sig
nature of Federalist, upon the fubjedt of the Re
presentation bill noiv before the President % yet ht
may be aflured that however misrepresentation:
may, for a time, deceive the citizens of this coun
try, the voice of truth will at last be heard and at
tended to. The people of the United States an
neither to be milled by sophistry, nor can decla
matory dogmas, however loud or plausible, perveri
the plain principles of common sense. It is to b<
wished, that those who abuse measures of govern
mÂ«nt, and venture upon the turbulent ocean of po
litical controversy, would adopt the previous cau>
tion, of annexing definite and precise ideas to th<
terms they use ; this is almost as necefi'ary to s
fair investigation as a true statement of facts,
Words are too often taken upon trust, and thoft
who are to judge upon public fubjecb, are some
times the dupes of a term j and more particularly
so if that term happens to be of factious import,
Take, for instance, the awful word, Confolidatior
âit is a word of dire fignif cation, as used by th<
Federalist. But as he applied it, I confefs to mi
it is altogether unintelligible. It is intended tc
convey to the citizens of the United States an ides
of the total deftruftion of that liberty and of thofi
rights for which their blood has fopr'ofufeJy flow
ed, and for which the treasures of this country
have been exbaufted. How this word can be thui
applied to the representation bill I am yet to learn
and it is for the genius of the Federalist alone, tc
reconcile things fooppofite in their nature and ef
feds. Does equality of representation imply con
solidation ? Is an equitable distribution of repre
sentatives among the several states, a confolidatior
of the union ? Ought then a numerous combina
tion of the general interests of the United States
to be stigmatized with an odious epithet, becauf
a few individuals are disappointed. Has the pow
cr of a single state been either diminished or ab
sorbed by the measure ? Does it operate as an en
croachment upon the liberty of the people of thi
United States, either in their individual or aggre
gate capacity ? What right is refrained, or wha
power has been enlarged by the principle of repre
fentation, which has been so loudly deprecated
The very calculation and table which this autho
has introduced, proves that he has either mifap
or misunderstood the term he has used. Hi
seems to argue that the whole unrepresented num
her of reprefentable inhabitants of the Unitei
States, by this bill, will amount to 50,981 âa ve
xy finall number indeed, when compared with an'
other scale of representation which can be brough
forward. By the table which he has producei
there appears to be at the ratio of one for 30,000
a frattionable number left unrepresented o
150,000. Now what will go with his doctrine o
virtual representation, as he calls it, which seem
so obnoxious to him j it would be at least as eligi
fele if true, as the doctrine of no representation a<
all, which would certainly be the caie with th<
surplus inhabitants by any other mode whicl
could be pra&ifed by the scale of one for 30,000
It is alfoto be remembered, that the bill had beer
before loft, in the dispute between 30 and 33,000,
There is equal injustice in imputing the success o
this bill to the casting vote of the Vice-President:
In this he has been mifinformed j the Vice-Pre
fident has never given a vote upon it. It had i
fufficient majority without such an appeal. A 1
to the ficknels of the Southern members, and theii
consequent absence, if it proves any thing, ii
proves too much j if it eftablilhes the inference
drawn from it, that the foutbern members, had
they been present, would at all events have voted
against the measure, it certainly shews that they
would have been governed by local reasons and not
by the real merits of the fubjeft. The man who
jJTeits without faÂ£, calumniates, and no person
dare determine how gentlemen would vote who
had not attended the difcuflion of the question.
It is not impoflible for northern and southern
members, I trull, sometimes to agree, in their
votesâthey have done it in this very business.
It is unfortunate for us, and very feriouily to be
lamented, that four of the eight representatives
are to come from the east of the Hudson. This
is the poisoned fhaft which leaves the incurable
woundâa wound whose anguifti no pa liative can
afluage, nor can any balsam on earth check its
malignityâfix eastern states fend four members,
Jersey, Delaware, North and South-Carolinas
will furnifii the reft. Hard indeed is the fate of
the United States. Much indeed is it to be re
gretted that the state of Virginia has not been al
lowed 22 members,âthe equilibrium of power
might then be better fupp#rted, and if a few ob
noxious funding systems, bank plans, and Reports
of the Secretary of the Treasury could be by any
means annihilated, the government might yet be
saved from the dark impending cloud of threaten
ing diAblutionâbut I mean not to make painfui
reflexions, âI acknowledge the wisdom, and ref
pett the virtue of that state, and only hope fli<
may consult her true and permanent interest, and
will wait for the prosperity that will attend herj
until the blefiings of the present government, by
a natural progress, may reach her. The time 1
do not contemplate as very distant when this evenl
will take place,âas soon as truth shall be more
powerful than declamation, a few old fafhioned
prejudices removed, and one or two local laws re
pealed, money will be plenty, credic restored, and
the people contented and happy.

THE JURIES OF FRANCE.
[From a London paper*]
It may be pleasant to our readers to fee the pre
cile manner in which the French have determin
ed to arrange their juries for the trial of crimina
pauses, and how it differs from ours.
The municipality of Paris, in obedience to the
law, have iftued a decree concerning the forma
tion of juries. It recites the Jaw on the subject,
which ordains, that they /hall commence from
the ift of January, 1792.
1. The procurer of the commons /hall make a
lift of thirty proper persons to compote the jury
of accusation, which answers to our grand jury.
2. That every a&ive citizen, who has the qua
lifications of an eledtor, /hall, before the 15th
of December in each year, write his name on a
register, to serve on the jury for judgment,
3. That out of this register, the procurator
general Syndic of the department /hall choose
;very three months, 200 persons, who /hall fo:n.
the jury of judgment for that time.
4. Eligible citizens neglecting to inferibe theiâ 
names on the register in the month of Decembei
[hall be deprived of their fuffrage for two years.
5. No citizen can be put twice on the lift oi
icojurymen, in the course of one year, withou
[lis consent.
The decree concludes with an animated appea
:o the citizens of Paris on the great duty of com
ng forward todifcharge the fun&ions ofjurymen,
Â»nd states that a double register is opened lor th<
nfcription of citizens in each of the forty-eigh
e&ions of Paris.
Thus in reality they are to have a (landing jun
or three months, nominated by the procuratoi
syndic, who again is nominated by the people.
When a prisoner comes to be tried, he has thi
"ight of objection, as in England, and the offena |
s tried by twelve jurymen. The reason of thii
nanner of ftricking a jury was, that in the be
ginning of a popular system it was thought tha
:he people were not fufficiently enlightened to be
:aken indiscriminately, as in England j but it h
lot fubjedt to the feiious objedlion of setting up .
mall number of individuals to be canvafied on
>articular occasions, and of course it is not liable
o the fame imputations as lie against our own
pecial jurymen in crown causes, namely, thai
he dearest fun&ion of a free man, that of
uftice, is turned into a profitable trade.
