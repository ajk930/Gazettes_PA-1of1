the support of every virtlioits citizen
The public good is indeed. its sole object
.md we think that the best means are pur
sued for obtaining it, \i hen we recogn z;
the following, as the fundamental princi
ples of our aiibciatioil.
I. Tk it the people have the inherer.'
r.nri exclufivc right and power of makint
altering forms of government ; ant
that tor regulating and protecting our so
oil interelts, a republican govern
WENT is the mod aatural and beneficia
jbriit, which the wifdoiri of man hasdc
vifed.
11. Tii AT the republican conftitutionsi'
the rviTED States & of the State or
leXNSVLVaNIA, being framed and fclta
bliihed by the people, it is our duty a aooc
<i'Jzens. to support thcin. And in ordei
rffeclu illy to clo so, it is lilcewife the diuj
of every freeman,to regard with attention,
and to tHfcufs without fear, the conduit oj
the public servants, in every departmeni
of government.
ill. That, in considering the admi
jii.Tration of public aff.irs, men au
meafurc?fhould be elli'iiated according ti
their intrinsic merits ; and therefore, re
gardJefs of party spirit or political connec
tion, it is the duty of evtry citizen, bv
making the general welfare the rule of his
conduct, to aid and approve those men and
measures, which have an influence in pro
moting the profperisy ofttie common
wealth.
IV. That in the choice of persons to
fill the offices of government, it is efl' nti
al to the exigence of a free republic, that
every citizen should ast according to hi?
own judgment, and, therefore, any at
tempt to corrupt or dt hide the people in
exercising the right* of Tuff-age. e'tner by
promising tlie favour ot one cand date, or
traducing the of another, is an

Fellow Criizr",
VXTF. bare the pleasure to communicate
to voti a copy of the constitution of
' The Democratic Society," in hopes, thai
lfter a candid cenfideration of its princi
ples and objects, you maybe induced tc
jroniote its adoption in the county, oi
,vhi< h yon are an inhabitant.
Every mind capable of reflection, miifl
ierceive. that the present crisis in the po
iticstif nations, is peculiarly interesting tc
America. The Kuropcan confe leracy.
riinfcendeit in power,and unparalleled ir
niqnity , menace, the very cxillence ol
Veedom. Already Its baneful operat or
nay be traced in the tyrannical deftructior
â¢f the constitution, and the rapacious par
itio 1 of the territory of Poland: ant
hould the glorious etiorts of trance be e
.â¢entually defeated, we have reaf-Â»nto pre
ume. that, for the ponfammation of mo
urchical ambition, and the security ol it
â ftablill.ments. this country the only re
ltaining depolitory of liberty, will not lonu
le permitted to enjoy in pi* ce the honor
>f an independent, and the hapi inefs of a
epnbhcan government.
N'oi" are the da gers from afÂ®
e'gn source, the only causes. at this tims
if apprehenfiou and iolicitude. The feed
>f luxury appear to have taken root i:
Hir clom flicfuii; and the jerlotts eye ( '
5 itriotifm already regaids 'he fpivit <
freedom and equality, as eclipsed by the
pride ot wealth, and the arrogarite c
power.
Th.s -enera! view of our fitii"t'on, hn
led to ibv uiituuiiuu o: " Psniovrati'-
Society. 1 ' A constant cirtulation of nfe
ful information. and a liberal communica
tion ot republican fentimeiits, were
:houglit to be the best antidotes to any
political poison, with which the vital prin
ciplesotc .il liberty might attacked :
lor, by such moans, a Iratei rial co ifidence
will be ftablifbed among the citizens;
every fyrr otum of innovation will be (tudi
oufly ma *ed ; and a llaudard will be e
reifed. t<' which, in danger and distress.
the h ientis of liberty may fuccefsfully re
sort.
To obtain these objefH, then, ar.d to
cultivate on all occasions, the love of peace,
order, arid harmony; nnattachmenttothe
couOituti >ns, and a reflect to the laws of
our country, will be the aim of " I'll
Democratic Society." Farty and perfonai
confide rations arc exc uded from a fyflem
of this nature } for, in the language of the
articles under which we are united, men.
tnd measures wilt only be elfimated ac
to their intriniic met its, and theii
influence in promoting the profyetity of

From yon, citizen, we hrtpe to derive
flential aid,.in extending the Society, 'rii
nainraining its gfimtr.e principles. Wi
vcjueff, therefore, an early attention t<

which should lorni the basis of our govern

they are legally pofTefied of, or have aright
to exercise. The period. I trait is not
t ir distant, w hen we (hall be able with ac
curacy to discriminate between tliofe who
are the real friends and enemies of the na
tion. A spirit of enquiry seems to have
animated our citizens, which cannot fail
of being prodtiftive of the most beneficial
consequences to the community. The
intriguing machinations o einiflaries, and
d?fign:ng plots of interna! enemies, many
p.it io*k and well intentioned writers are
endeavouring to expose, and I hope we
shall soon plainly discover the inimical dif
p ifutons and hostile intentions, now rank

to lead to a violation..of filemn treaties,
to infringe the unalienable rights of fiee
men and perhaps ultimately to involve in
i 1 a war, unjust as to its inducement, and
tin natural as to itsohjeft.
The Prelident's late proclamation ha'
been thec,bjeft of much anitoadverlion, and
censure from fnmr quarters. Nt to bring
into queflion the policy or legality of the
n J i,(ure. the ambiguity of its language ha'

The iraprifonment of two Americans
w'lo generously abandoned their rountrj
to combat the enemies of I berty under the
tri "co'oured flag of France, ii an instance
o r outrage, which I hope, will forevet
remain unparalleled in the annal of free

the nioft invaluable which a freeman car
enjov. It is not delivered up into t.'if
J"ia-ds of the com nunity .it is one which
so far from infringed, should be
pr-tccted by ttje government. The verj
jdea of detenr 0:1 when no criminality de
m'nds a furrendor to j aAice, is totally in
conp3tib]e with the name of liberty
When therefore citizen' Singleterry am

of liberty, the rights of freemen, and the

Tie detention the prizes belonging tc
the Fre.nih republic, has received to > inucl
difcufliOn in the public papers, to admit ol

conduct, intrigue and chicane have market
in indelible characters the v. hole o' the
proceedings relative to that affair, as wel
as the intended ftappage- of the Lrttle De
mocrat. The principles upon which the
prizes were held in cultod , and the calling
out the nvlitia for that piirpofe, were my-
Iteries known only within the veil of the
cabinet. Far be it from me to inlininte
that every official act of the preii-ien!

pVERY on? rem'mbers the celebrated
Balloon for which the late Mr. Dick
er set a subscription on foot in New V ork,
in January 1-89. The subscription was
lill.-d by the July following, and the day fixed
fir the afcentof theadventurou aeronaut.
It is almost needless to brinj, into view the
fate of that immense unwieldy smoke-bag.
1c was attempted to be filled by meafts of
fire being set to several lubftances spread
under it, ftich as damp draw, chopped
v. 001, &C.&C. but through some miftua
nagement, or the inadequacy of the mean ,
it was never completely indited Jn tin
midst of the exertions of those* in the Jeer el
the balloon (whieh was made of raven'
duck) took fire, and it was with some diffi
culty the aeronaut tfcjtped from the con
ftagration with the loss of his whlfliers.
a (kin conliderably scorched by the blaze,
and the pu: firing curses, menaces, and ex
ecrations of one or two thotifand fubferi-
Icrs,âA few days before Mr, Decker'
in. ended ascent; the following addrefi was
lent to him, which you will pieafe to
prefetve ia your National Gazette.
" To Mr. Dr.CJCF.R.
Ot k vi:it to America is pleasing to
every one, and to none more than mvfelf.
1 have read with much pleasure, mixed
with altonifhment, many publications of
the surprizing and fuccefsful vo'yagc-s that
have been made into the upper regions ;
and as the clay isfaft appro idling, on u hie;.
Von mean r.o aflonifh the inhabitants of thi>
Itibliuiary world -itli your bold flight,l am
half tempted to request a palTage in the
grand balloon you are now preparing for
the enter,ainment of tiie citizens of New
*?rk. There is bjit one preliminary I
' 1 t() adjusted with you previous tc
departure, and that being agreed to, the
pillage money (ball be paid down.âSir,
â Â«- are informed, that the upper regions
belong solely to a great p.ince, even the
; nnce of the Tower of the Air, who ha.-
tiillfway and absolute authority over the
v atmosphere of this globe, therefore,
notu ithftanding he has kindly permitted
vers! balloon men hitherto to proceed on
uninterrupted, and without a legal pas
e>. octired from himfelt or some of his agent
ere below, ;t may not always be the cale.
.i(l that fiion Id he happen to be a little out
â¢â f humour on the day of your ascension,
& on your mounting some miles high, (ltould
chance to meet you, full butt, and demand
(l fee your puss, blef. me what mull be the
atal consequence, fliotild it not be in your
power to produce one ? Alas! 1 fear no
thing less than the entire annihilation of
Mr. Decker, balloon and aM, in an instant!
i oil to know, Sir, the whole artil
er\ of t.ie f. y is abfoUltely at the command
of this prince, and a single tremendous
â¢ Imnder bolt would fee fnificient to do
}om btilinefs cffeftfially ; therefore prav
ake my advice, and arm your balloon
Â° IIC ' franklin's fpecific con
ncting-rods : we are convinced of the
' '"cr.cypf them, and theperfeft fecnrity of
ii,barking with yon when thus protected ;
hen will Mr. Decker and I. if permitted,
triumphantly (oar aloft, and dare to look
lis god/hip full in the face, undaunted
at his grim fuily phiz and terrific appear

AN ORATION,
Delivered at the request of the Ciceronian
Society by their l>i efident, on the Anni
verf.iry of American Independence.
Gentlemen,
'"pHE impifilion which you have made
upon my mind, by appointing trie to
this place, tan never be removed. Called
upon so unexpectedly to (peak amor? .fl
you in commemoration of an event which
the whole world has witnclled with thf
plaudits of rapture, without having that
affillance of time and leifme afforded ms
which the importance of the ftrijeft de
mands, my situation cannot but appear ex
tremely awkward indeed. The vail theme
which requires the energy of pathos itfelf
o do it j'iftice, mud 'tisevident, dwindle
even b low itsown greatness, v. rt
tempted by Hmon whom you have thoiicht
proper to impose the duty.
The 4fn o* July, i 776, is a riemorable
sraâbig in itfelf as iU'efpefls the prefen;
age, and of the gre ate ft moment as it re
gard- polterity. The annals of every Ra
tio 'i are consulted in vain to fx attention
(lpon one fÂ» replete with striking instance
of hardy figeneC., magnanimity, and glo
riuiis enterprise. None living at the pre
feiu day are ignorant of the illustrious iafh
which have tendefl to immortalise the
names of thufe heroes who were actors in
the great scene of the revolution. None
withhold the tribute of gratitude and ap
plause, at this day, for the grand achieve
ments of the late American warriors.â
And who, in turning over the records of
tim-, pauses not to contemplate rile majes
ty of that ..nguft synod which spoke Ame
rica free and independent > W ho reads the
hiltoric p?.ge& becomes no' fafcinated by
rhe astonishing fefforts ot calm deliberation
in the cabinet, and warm intrepidity in the

bears not in mind the memory of "tllefe

honour afforded art asylum from the hor
rors^of-the bloody conflict? B-lit it is net
lor me, my friends, to awaken you to an
acquaintance with the men and measures
<if 17-6, nor to dwell on scenes so recent
which have been fa of ten painted to you,

Fhe b'aft of gratitude has already fprc:

Our children have a right to t xpect a tranf

' iviulate as we re.eived t. And hence it
is our indifbert' ble ciity to exert every ef
fort agair.ft all those who would wrelt the
legacy from its.
My friends, it is on this account wc
(liou.d pause whenever an important politi
cal qiiellion is agitated ; we ihould ask
ourit'lves if v. ehavebeen faithful to the
trull reposed in us; we should make a
ftricl(crutmy. ami on every occasion regu
late our conduct bythe ti.ierr ng guidance
of republican plainness. \\ e (houid bear in
mind that before the happy ;ra of the
American revolution, the urm.verfary of
w inch we rtionld delight in commemorat
ing, that juvenile associations like our own
were altogether unheal d of, that we are
indebted to that event for the legality of
our proceedings, and that only by ? mutual
emulation in adhering to the principles!
which gai-e rife to the eflyvlifument of li
berty and equality, can the catife of our
fathers be fnpported. For though the Uni
ted States are now free from the fetters
of tyrannical ufurpatir.n. and thoup.fi the
flame qf freedom has began to fl.ine beyonct
the Atlantic, yet as the great principle is
l Â«it univerfdlly adopted there is danger to
be apprehended from a fluggifli confidence
â if our fecunty. The Sre which has pur
ged th s land from corruption,& which is
kindled in the bosom ot France, may be
erctinguifhed. And it' this should ever be
effeoe<i, as it is to be feared it v ill if fuel
be not cottflantly added to tjie blntr, the
defpotifin o! f urope \\ ii! rage with great
er fury than before, the various impurities
of, tyranny ~,vill aga<n dc iiie our foil, anil
the cause of freedom w ill receive a .fatal
wound.

me to ejaculate in the following manner.
âO America ! this great and populous
city which thou prdeft thyfelf on, will

But we, that f'corn a monarch's chain,

And laid in dust the proud Baltille.
To Gallia's rich and splendid crown,
This mightv day gave such a blow,
As Time s recording hand (hall own,

No single gem some BrutU'- stole,
But inllant ruin feiz'd the whale.
Now tyrants rife, once more to bind
In royal chains, a nation freed â
Vain hope ! for they, to <le ith confign'd,

Aflilt to speed that golden time.
