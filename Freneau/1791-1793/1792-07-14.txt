(From Catharine Phillips's Travels thro'
England)
I will venture to recommend, as tending
to reduce ihe high prices of provilions, the
more general use ot oxen for tillage, and
even drawing of carriages, rather than so
many liorles. So much has already been
written oti this fubjedt, as to demonltrate
that it would be greatly to the advantage
of farmer ,to till their land with oxen. I
can fee 110 r#afou for their gi\ ing the pre
ference to horles, but that fhey do the
work quicker ; and if they.would try oxen
in the traces, inilead of putting tltem un
tier the yoke, perhaps' that excuse would
fail them. They will go Headier, falier,
and I think, draw a greater burthen ; and
on public road 3 this method must be far
preferable to yoking them. I have seen a
waggon drawn by fix or more oxen in the
traces, and was told, the owner of them
much preferred that method to the yoke ;
that they were employed in carriage as well
as tillage, and that they drew hi* waggon
loaded from his house to Exeter, which is
full 17 miles, and returned again in a day.
Prodigious weights are drawn and even
carried by these annuals in countries where
in thev are generally tiled. And I doubt
not iftarmers and waggon-keepers would
thoroughly try the before mentioned me
thod, but much of our carriage as well as
tillage might be done by oxen, whereby the
prices of beef, tallow, leather, &c. might
be reduced.
It appears to me probable, that an im
provement upon the method used for draw
ing with horses in traces, might be made
for oxen. As much of the strength of the
ox i; fiippofed to lie in it 3 neck, which I
conclude to be the reason for its being fub
jeited to the yoke, might not an additional
collar, peril ips belt made of toarfe linen,
whereto . cprd or light chain hiight be faf
tened, ai clthat again fattened to the carri
age or plough, ill tile manner the Laplan
ders attach their rein-deer to their fledges,
lo tend to keep down the neck of the ox, as
that more strength might be exerted by
that part, thaniniheufual method of draw
ing in the traces only. Aâ¢: this is merely
my own coijj*Â£lure, I only propose it for
consideration. The oxen I saw draw in
the traces, drew fingie ; and J did not ob
serve, nor hear, that their geer was ai*
wife different from that of horses: eviAi
the lhafts were filled by an ox, and all seem
ed to draw with more eal'e, than when
wriggling under the yoke. As the thing
was, to ine, new, l took the mqre particu
iar notice. But if these valuable beasts
yere more generally used, it might be hop
ed that their inhuman drivers would not
be fullered to beat them, as though their
ftelli like that ot the poor horses, was only

When it i" considered that all parts of the
oxen are ufeftri, and divers ot them very
valuable, and how much lei's expence it is
to breed and to feed them than horses, and
that horses when worn out are worth buia
mere trifle, it is admirable that they are
*ottu ore generally used in this money-get
ting nation. Their fttfh, fat, hides, horns,
hoofspiair, yea, their very guts are uied
either for food, cloathing, or by our arti

A celebrated French author .(BufTon) fays
of the ox, " lit is the mcfl advantageous of all
doineftics to the farmer ; he is the very
source and support of agriculture. For
merly the ox constituted the wliole riches
of mankind ; and he is Hill the balis.of the
riches of nations, which fubfrft and ftourifh
only in proportion to the cultivation of
their lands, and number of their cattle, for
ill these all real wealth consists : even gold
and (liver, being only fictitious reprefentati
ons,have 110 real value but what is confer
red upon them by the productions of the
earth.
Perhaps some ofour modern farmerÃ may
be too wife, or too conceited, to receive
these old-fp.fiiioned maxims, and may as re
lu&antly consent to do their bnlinefs with
oxen, as did the Irifli to draw their ploughs
otherwise than by the horses' tails, How
ever that fenfeleft citftoin is now, generally,
in disuse ; and we may also hope that hors
es will be more disused in the course of
time in agricultural employments! f -* nr
rulers have latterly been other wife il.o bu

fare of the nation, or they might think it
worth while to encourage the use of oxen,
by fmull premiums, or other benefits to the
farmers, who are mofl likely to be con
vinced by present intereffs, of the utility
ofany measure proposed. 2fbut the tolls ot
turnpikes were rcmittedthem itmigli t in
duce tome toincreafe their number of these
very strong and ufeful cattle j and I do not
think the turnpikes would fuffer much By
this indulgence, as oxen in. travelling dc
much less damage to the roads than horses.

A leading feature in the character of the

branch of tire Ifgiflattire is known to fa
vour secrecy in public matters, those fufpi-
Cions gain the easier credit, and the unpo
pularity of that important part of the gov

they pay the tax, and the attention to them, di
vided, those that go in other conveyance
than the mail stage, cannot be expected t<
have the fame care taken of them as of the

was made the temptation of the port-office:
to disfawiur the conveyance out of the mail
whence a greater proportion of mifcarriag

inent and discontent of the fubferibers. Ir
the distant dates, the home-papers earning
out, many of them, but once a' week, anc
having (late matters enough to fill up the
greater part of them, can'republifh but a
final! share of what passes at the feat of
Congress. Wherefore, the people in fuel
slates are deeply affected by the measure,
and in danger of being kept sadly in the
dark concerning the conduct of their pub
lic servants. The regulation having taker
place also at the eve, as it were, of a gen
eral election, it will have the evil effect of
keeping the people from knowing the con
duct of the government and of their ref
peftive representatives, at the veryjunfture
of time when they are to redreft their griev
ances, if they have any ; and there are
many, who give into the suspicion, that this
unfeafonablenefs of the time was not mere
accident, but that it might be intended, a
mong other things, to favour electioneer
ing cabals, and put the country people in
general, as well as the remote slates, in the
power of a few who can lay their heads to
gether and carry on their secret manoeu
vres. Whatever mav have been the secret
designs of a few in this matter, candour de
mands that others should be acquitted of
any ill views, It is nevertheless an unhap
py aH'alr, and will make the eufiiing gener
al elettion notfo iatÂ»Â»faÂ£lory a touchstone of
the public mind as it ought to have been,
for it is certain, in many places where
the information contained in ,the papers
will not now circulate, the ele&ions will
turn very differently from what they would,
if the people kne\y as much as is known
here, on the spot. The evil is so much the
greater, by increasing one of the heaviest
inconveniencies ever charged on the, feder
al government by its opponents. For all
the most sober and argumentative charac
ters who set themfclves against the great
powers veiled in the government ahvayj
bent their objections principally again# tlu
vaftextent of the country, inferring there
from an impossibility of keeping the consti
tuent body duly informed, and the conse
quent want of responsibility in the govern
ment, and of a fui4kient check in the people
over their rulers. And altho' this objecti
on was carried much too far, yet it mult be
allowed to have weight thus far, that all
possible ways and means of bringing th'a
members of tilt government under the eye
of the people by easy, quick, and cheap in,
telligence. ought to have been fludied anil
promoted, instead of this ill-favoured tajs
at this suspicious time, which prodycingthe
contrary effect of putting the government
further out of tight of the people, must be
frtKfvely,deplored by every man who is a
trud friend to the government and to right
meifures, without favour, affection, or
partiality.

"Toreadfome of our papers, and to

that the game of bloody noses, broken

to good order will deptecate brutal excess

to what is sometimes observed in courts,
where the pleader who makes the mofl
noise has generally the worlt fide of the

fee men, who were avowedly hostile to
the American revolution, in the dark days

That bade her generous fonrtlifdaiu
The fetters that their fathers wore,
The titled (lave, a tyrant's sway, _

Bright day ! a partner iii thy joy,

She feels her toils, her blood repaid.
When fiercely frantic to destroy,
( P â¢ Hid of the laurels he had won)
The Briton, here, unfheath'd his blade.
By traitors driv'n to ruin's brink
Fair freedom dreads united
The world mull fall if /lie mull bleed ;
And yet, by heaven ! I'm proud to think
The world was ne'er subdued by slaves
Nor fnall the hireling herd succeed.
Boy ! fill the generous goblet high ;

The fall of kings, the fates foredoom,
The crown decays, its Iplendours d;e ;
Arid they, who were a nation's boalt
Sink, and expire in endless gloom.
Thou, fcranger, from a distant fllore,
Where fetter'd men their rights avow,
Why on this joyous day so Hid ?
Louis insults with diains no more,
Than why thus wear a clouded brow,
When every manly heart Is glad ?
Some pafiing days and rolling years
May 'fee the wrath of kings dXplay'd,

But orphans' groan â , and widows' tears,
And uftice lifts her Ihining blade

The hot weather ba-.ing now seriously
set in, the town will be for a time defer

yers, journeymen weavers, foopmen, and a
variety of other aefcriptions of people
who have rot made their fortunes, will,
if they are prudLiit, remain at home not
wittiHanding the heat, or at moll content
themselves with a ride to Gray's gardens,
Harrowgate, or a promenade in the Hate
house square.
To those whefe circumstances enable
them to travel further a-field, for some
weeks residence, no place can afford a
more eligible retreat than Sh'rewfbury,
a delightful settlement in New-Jerfev, dis
tant about seventy miles, on a north ealt
eourfe, from this city.
No part of the sea coast of the United
States can exceed, and very few parts, if

An excellent foil of griziug uplaud,

with some emotion, that no other land
lies in that direction, Giort of Europe and
Africa.
To the northward you have a roman

FRENCH MANIFESTO.
The following are the principles contain
ed in the French Manil'eflo, drawn up
by M. Condorcet, in consequence of
the war now entered into between the
French nation and the king of Hun
g 21 7-
AS the French nation have forever re
nounced the idea of conquefl,, so they are
forced into a defenfive war merely to refill
tyranny, and defend the rights of man.
They will therefore consider the inha
bitants of those countries, which groan
under the despotism of the king of Hun
gary, not as enemies but as friends, Snd by
opp:>fing the tyrant thathas enslaved them
the French army will fight to set tlum free.
thscaufe of France is the cause of
all mankind, so the victories which she
may obtain, will be the triumph of human
nature.
They will aeither plunder nor massacre,
nor disturb, in any manner, their fellow
creatures, tho'fituated in the dominions
of thetyrant they oppose ; but they will
Ihelter them undei the glorious burner of
freedom, and they will receive as brethren,
all who may resort to it.
They only seek for glory, by promoting
the happiness of mankind.
As the French nation have for ages
been subservient to tyranny and ariftocra
tic plunder, so they can feel for, and tru
ly pity, those who are now in ihe ftat*
that Fiance wasin before the revolution.
Tyrants may lay countries wade, anc
uefolatc the globe j but freedom shall b
!h; attended by mercy, and an olive branch
[hall be twined about its sword.
The deluded and wretched mercenaries
who are paid to fight the battles of oppref
lion, and to rivet their own chains for
ever, even the blood of these men (hall be
spared, whenever the importance of the
jircumftances will permit,
The brave men who may quit the rank;
cf infamy, to join the animated army ol
the free, (hall be honoured, cherished, and
rewarded.
No letters of Marque (hall be grantee
by the National AlTembly, to fanftion tlu
abhorred plunder of individuals on tht
liigh seas ; and if the creatures of theii
enemy are taken in the act of piracy, the)
(hall be punished according to the law.
