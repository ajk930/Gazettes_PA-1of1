defence- and inn confident they would

could have produced in your owm vindi

v. lien we reflect on year well, known foii
citude to ojtain the favor ol i-he people, \\e
may very fairly impute your li!e:ice to i
cocfcioufnefc of the i npropriety of your

the fubjeft, it will only be neceifai'.y -.o en
quire into' the'facls which were proved ot
sjdinitred on the inveftigiition of Mr. Giles
refoltitious. As the publications arts leng
thy, and as some of my fellow citizens may
aoc have had time or patience to jve them
an attemjve perusal, i lliall endeavor, a
briefly as poffi'ole, to give a cletail ot the
leading fait 3 which appeared in the courfc
oi the enquiry.
It appeared.
That by a law of the 4th of Augiift 1790,
the Preiiilent was authorized to borrow
12,000,000 of dollars to be applied 1 to tilt
payment of the foreign debt of the United
States.
That by another law palled the 12th ol
Augult 1790, the Prelideut was anthorizec
to bo. ,'ow 2,000,000 of to be appli
ed towards linking tilt; CO;nÂ£ftie debt ol
the United States.
Tiiat the Prelident, on the 23th ot Ali
gn it 1790, authorized the secretary of tin
treufury to borrow the money; and pofi
tively inllruÂ£ted him, "immediately to ap
ply it in the manner directed by the -bovt
mentioned acts."
That the secretary of the treafiuy, '11
ftcad of applying the money borrowed un
der the firtt act to the difeharge of the fo
reign debt of the United States, drew ;
part of it over to America, and devoted il
to the life of the bank.
That the money borrowed under the fÂ«-
eond act,inltead of being applied to the dis
charge of the domestic debt of the U.States,
wasalfo drawn over & lodged in the bank,
contrary to the directions of the aÂ£t and
the express in(ti uÂ£tions of the President.
That fmce the time of making tliefe loans,
the United States have been fubjeited to
the payment of interelt 011 the foreign and
domestic debt, and alio interelt on the
money borrowed of Holland ; wh'n t the
bank has liad the use of 3,000,000 of dol
lars of the money borrowed of Holland,
without paying any interelt to the United
States.
That whi'lt the Aim of 3,000,000 of dol
lar:, the property of the United States was
loc'g d in the bank, the secretary of the
treasury. on behalf of the United States,
borrowed of the bank 400,000 dollars on
interelt of fiv-7 par cent.
That untill the 'alt feflion of Congress.
the secretary gave no oflicial informatior
of his coijdiltt; and when called on foi
information wrote an infolting, abusive
letter, -calling in question the motives ol
those virtuous members who thought an
enquiry necefiary.
These are some of the principal facts
which appeared in the examination of the
subject : and I fnbmit it to you whethei
they were r.ot all completely eftablilliet
either by the secretary's own reports, 01
by authentic document:. The resolution

these facts, and perfeUiy correfpone

(CIRCULAR.)
T<> the Citizens of Kentucky.
Fellow Citizen/,
THE Democratic Society of Kentucky.are
now organized, and have commitec) to us
[he charge of developing to yon their prin
ciples and objects.
They are imprefled with t!ie fennment,
that a Democracy by reorefentation is the
Irelf mode of government, which the wif
vlom of mail hath devised, and that all just
power can be derived only from the peo
ple ; of consequence tine people have the
exchilive right ot'framing anil alteringtheir
forms of government. Tlint in order to
prefervethe incttimable blefllngs of liberty,
from the open attacks of avowed tyrants,
or the more insidious, tho' much more de
[truitive machinations of ambitious and
intriguing men, it behoves the people to
watch oyer the conduct of their officers,
in every department of government.
Experience has shewn, that, the hope ol
impunity,' has tended to the encourage
ment of crimes, in public, even more than
in private life. The man, whom virtue
may not restrain from the breach of an im
portant trult, may be awed by the vigilant
and piercing eye <if his fellow citizens
This however would be insufficient to pre
serve, pure and uncontaminated, the belt
of all poflible governments. We ought to
be extremely cautious in the choice of men,
who are to rtprefent us in the exercifc of
the powers of government. Their public
characlers ought to be examined with
itriÂ£tnÂ«fs and attention, free from party or
religious prrjudii.es, ar.d uiii-ffeited by their
occupation, fortune,or connections. The
attempt to influence the vote of a freeman
either by the wify arts of promifird favor
or by base calumniation, ought to bt
fptir.ied at with contempt and abhorrence.
Thele are, iii the c.bltraft, the principle?
of the society. Their objects are to diffe
minato those principles, and to conciliate
affeftioimcc fenjirrients towards each other
anvng their democratic fellow citizens.
That thcic. objeits may be effefled, they
propose nut oniy to discuss the proceedings
of governnieftt. but to examine into the
conduit of its officers in every department.
They will dtfcufs arid examine with can
dor. but with the firmnelsand freedom be
cominj citizens, zealous for the liberties
of their country.
Tho blotted nage of liifiory has record
ed the fatl effects which the neglect of
li n.l.ir pi\ cautions has occasioned. Hat!
'.:u citizens of Athens been attentive :o the
conduct of their public men, the pitiful
rr;::ai;ein of Pifiiiratus would not have
inoofed upOil hi* country an odioustyran
ip. To recite every fruiiar event with
(iniilar confeijuences, wotrid extend our
latter b?)ii)nÂ«JÂ»ths.b"iinds which we pro-
I'.fc. T' o numerous, indeed, are the in
it .ices, \v -y:h, in former times, a like in
attention iiefents for our inftruftion.â
'.'/hat wc e then caf cd Revolutions, were
'tily a chailge of tyrants ; or if a moment
of freedom nncp-vcii ed, it was, as the
. i anlient beams of the'* fun, between two
iioiin:;. To the prefect age has it been
referyed to witness renovating Revolu
:iiuls. In America we fought not shelter
."out the oppreflion of one tyrant, under
.iia talon - ol another. The Rights of Man,
rhe principles of a government formed to
jrote?t'iiofc right;-, and ensure to our fel
on - Cit riitu, anil Our latest posterity,, the
j'ellings. c-t'freedom and equality, were the

Mr. Freneau,
r AM truly sorry that a publication 6f
mine, in your paper, (houid givefo nnii h
jffencc to a gentleman I always lov'd
and elteem'd, and whom 1 ha?e often
leard with much fatisfaftion, and I hope
with fonie degree of improvement ; tfpe
ially as he vas ny no means intended or
hinted at ; I knew before Mr. M. or he
wrote, of the time Mr. Smith left the city,
the appointments âthe good and fufficient
reasons he had for so doing, and ot his re
turn âbefore that M. S. was carried to the
prefs.âln that publication I exprefo'd the
sentiments cf ali I converted with on the
fubjeit, (some of them \\ ifer, and I hope
bet-tcr than myfeif.)
But I mtdt beg leave to set Mr. Smitl:

with as much heart u ill as evet
I did, or am enabled to do ; and I can ap
perl to the omnifcieni searcher of hearts ;
he knows that malevolence was far froit
my heart ; strange ii deed i Could the Rev.
Mr. Smith in theabundanceof liiscliriftinr
charity find, or suppose no other motive
than malevcience âHe certainly tail for
get that " faithful are the wounds of n
friend"-"-! tfperfed no mat:, X gave jtift
praise where I thought it warâand !ti:'
â  hink it is due, & here I did not include
Mr. Smith, at 1 had with much pleasure
[Total Numb. 204.]
heard of his fafe return; and whether I
am fool, knave, ignorant declaimer, or
malicious pat tizar, âor the rtverje ot' all
these abusive epithets, is belt known to my
own mailer, and I would fain hope Mr.
Snvth's inafter is mine alsoâ-I doubt noc
that he is the betterfervant; (he had much
need) that lie is, or may be much more
profitable, I reft allured :âBht, O what a
blefling is it, that we are to be judged by
one y. ho knows the whole heart and every
motive there ; and with me, it is a small
matter, to bcjtidged of man's judgment â¢â¢
Mr. Smith may call me dog or devil, if he
will, but I hope I ihall be enabled to for
give him, and to fay (what I in truth think)
that he is a worthy and ufeful minister of
the gofpcl of Jesus Chrill ; and I thir.k I
ain obliged even to himfelf, for putting me
in mind to "bless them that curse me."
As to ihe do&rine of predestination, I for
merly said I was not against it in a reafon
â ible lenfe ; but iince I came to adult years,
two points I cannot approve, firft, eternal
reprobat.on, becatlfe it ic represents the all
glorious, holy, ju'.V, and only good Beingâ
in a ligtt unworthy ol the God I was
to adore and love ; the second is,
(what some advance) t4 that all our voliti
ons and aÂ£lions, good and t'jil arepredefti
natedâa coutroveriy might require a vo
lumeâbut I ihall only beg leave to menti
on two anecdotesâA man in prison, under
Sentence ol death, lor murdering his neigh
bour, was vihted by a filend, who blamed
him exceedingly lor his very wicked ani
ons; his anfutr was, 11 It certainly uat
'predeftinatcvl, for I bad many llruggles in
my mind befori- I committed it, but, hap
ptni.ig to meet hiui suddenly, and in a pri
vate place, I felt myfelf impeiled to kill
him."
An elderly lady (a predeflinariatl in the
â  iinioll latitude) said to her servant, " I
believe, Katrie, you are with child.''â
" Well (lays Kattiejif it ii so, it mull have
been predelllnatedj and how could / help

I -mething o! both io.otiffelves ; âbut what
ih,Jc are in an eternal, infinite and incom
pre|- s er,hb!e Beings is a â¢' knowledge too
nigh for me."
liut I will have ro contest or controver

or any other fubjefta ; â and here I cer
tainly drop itâRemaining, with my bell

PHTLANTHROPO3.
P. S. I did riot fee Mr. Smith's publica

or would Save forwarded this to the prcfi
f-'enei": I am as raid It will be too late for
tomorrow s paper, if so, please to insert ic
in Saturday's and obi'ge Yours, Sec.
t\ riting the above i.i much haste, j for
got to delire Mr. Smith to review my fiill,'
where tie will doubtlcfs perceive that my
zeal was not that of Jelni ; it was rot
about lorms of v\ orlhipâor pulling down
idols (uniel's the extra points ot contro
verted opinions may be called Idols) but a
zeal, more or less, for the welfare of ma
ny of my fellow-citizens in a time of great
diltrefr ; or too great a delire to ihew my
zeal, but this fiippi litioli was debarred by
my choofingan anonymous fignauire.

The name of the commander of the

The National Commissioners at Corsica

A letter from Hague, dated Aug. 2, fays
according to the last letters from the
camp of the king of Prussia, all the French
troops had left Mentz on the 26th ult. the
king had quitted his head quarters atÃo
denheim, and established them at Kirche
im -Poland, from which it was concluded
that further operations were forthwith
to be commenced. On examination there
had been found at Mentz 220 French and
iBo German pieces of cannon and mortars,
300,0001b. of good gunpowder, and corn
and wine in abundance, and that it was
supposed the discord among-ke garrison

iiJes here as a merchant. On his firtt ar
rival, the Porte forbade any of the inter

ed by his nation in the course of the lalt 6
months have determined the Divan to fol

fuopofed that the arrival of the combined

According to the accounts from Poland,
-we are aflured that a New Constitution
â¢will be erected upon the foundations of the
Constitution of the year 1775. The fol
lowing articles have transpired :
1. The King in future lhall not be elec
ted by the whole nation, but by a new
Diet, in which the number of the members
fliall be multiplied to three times as many
as in an ordinary Diet.
2. The Diet lhall assemble every four
year 3, instead of every twe years. The
king lhall in the interval govern the na
tion, with the assistance of the Permanent
Couiicil.
3. The present king (hall employ three
millionsout of the fix millions of Poiifh
florins, which compose his rerenues, in
paying off his personal debt*.
We are further informed, that the pre
sent government has found ways and means
to raise sixteen millions of florins, in order
to supply the wants of the bcw civil lift
which has been granied.

London, Aug. ij. It is worriiy of remark
that Llie Gazette account oi the capitula
tion of Metitz omits the signatures; no
names, and consequently no defci iptions of
parties fighting appear. Was this a paltry
artifice to conceal f'omething that looked
like an acknowledgment of the French
Republic by the king Â©f Pruflia ?
The illuminations recommended by the
treasury papers, are no doubt meant to en
able us to fee the great advantages we gain
by taking towns in Flanders, for the empe
ror and king. An honeit citizen was allied,
why he illuminated on the joyful news of
the surrender of Valenciennes, to whom
he answered, I think.there never waÂ« more
occasion, for 1 am i'ure we are all in the
dark relative to the matter.
It is liippofed, on a moderate calculati
on, that illuminations in this country, in
conlequence of our victories ill America,
during the late war, did not toft less than
ioo,cool. ..
The experience of last campaign afford
ed a llrong presumption of the elfeft that
the taking of Valenciennes and Condr
will have upon the French. Till the lols
of Longwy Veiduii they seemed to (hew
a torpid indifference as to the events of
the war ; bat 110 sooner did those places
fall, than the whole nation rushed to arms.
The Marquis De la Fayette, made an
observation at the memorable period of
the American war, which applies molt
tiro ugly to the projected invasion offrance.
" The Englilh (laid he) are mad: They
march through a country, and they think
that by so doing; they may conquer it 1"
In the Netherlands the a.htd armies
have gained very great arid unexpected
(lores of ammunition by the caplure of
Valenciennes.
Lille has long been almost ftirrounded,
and it fecms reasonable to expert, that the
blockade will now be rendered complete,
as the general (Lamorliere) who has hi
therto commanded in that town, is carried
prisoner toParis, accused of having negleif
ed to provide the means of defence. But
among the principal operations of the re
mainder of the campaign, that which is
spoken of with the greatest probability, iÂ»
the intended liege oi Dunkirk, by the Bri
tifli,Hanoverian and Hellian forces ; while
the Prince of Saxe Coboui'g, after taking
Maubeuge, Boucliaiu, and possibly Cam
bray, will be able effectually to cover the
beliegers from any attack in the field, and
to pursue the advantages ef the war as fait
as they may open. To dijplay the utility
or importance of this great project, would
lead us back into half the history of all our
wars with France since the Revolution ;
but its immediate benefit will be the fecti
rity of Oftend, during the winter, so ne
cessary to the debarkation of our forces,
provisions and ammunition.
The arrival of the Weft-India home
ward bound fleet, is ainongft the fortu
nate events of the war.
From the Mediterranean we have in
telligence, that the French National Corn
millioners are returned or expelled from
Corsica : but we know not yet under what
atifpices general Paoli willfet up his stan
dard : whether the independency of his
native island is to be once more asserted,
or whether the ueceflity of foreign suc
cours and protection, exaggerated benefits,
and ambitious alliances, will not prove
fatal to the visionary liberty of a country
which has neither internal resources nor
piiyfical means of felf defence, or the pow
er, perhaps, of dispensing with the dange
rous guaranty of some despotic benefaifor.

ington on Friday tie 27th ult. from head
quarters in 18 days, we are informed, that
the army is said to be about 3000, in good
health, good spirits, and in a hijli slate of
discipline. Thehorfe about 300 âin good
plight, and cr.pable of any service. The
road to Fort Jefferton well made, and im
proved since the last campaign.âSixty
thousand bushels of corn were raised in the
neighbourhood of Fort Jefferfon this sum
mer, by the garrison. Waggons had been
biilily employed in drawing out the stores,
until orders came to defilt, left ujfibrage
fliould be given to the Indians, and the
treaty fliould be disturbed. But 011 the
express arriving from the President of the
United States, announcing the result of the
treaty, and giving orders to prepare to car
ry on a campaign, the Kentucky volunteers
were called, and it was expected the army
would be ready to move in four days.â
General Wayne had appointed the Colonels
of the volunteers; the Colonels appointed
the Majors ; the Majors the Captains ; the
Captains the Subalterns ; and also chose
and nominated the soldiers whom they
wished to accompany them ; in which cafe
it was a point of honor not to refufe.
Piomingo, or the Mountain Leader, the
Chickafaw chief, was 011 his way with 20c
warriors, 15 had arrived at the camp ; 5c
were at Lexingtau, &c-

Extract of a letter from the Territory
South ot the Ohio, Sept. 4.
" Times here wear but a gloomy afpefl.
The frontier is daily hariaffed by thelndi
ans. On the 28th of August, a party, con
lilting of about 300, killed Lieut. James
Tedford, of the United States troops, and
a Mr Jackson, as they were gathering corn
in a field tor their horses, near Henry's Na
tion âThey have lately burnt many homes
011 Nine Mile, and destroyed a prodigious
quantity of wheat, rye and corn. We
hope Governor Blourit, on his return tc
this territory, will be invested with power
to destroy these barbarous tribes."
From the fame, dated Sept. 1.4.
" On the 30th of August, some Indians
killed one young woman and scalped an
other in Washington county ; and, 011 the
y.h inft. a party of them wounded four
perrons, and scalped one, about nine miles
from Green court-house ; a house was also
attacked by them, but they were forced to
retreat by the owner thereof and one of
his daughters, who fired several rounds,
and wounded some of them. On the 16th,
another party of the lavages killed a wo
man and child, on Nine Mile."
TheÃritidi packet Duke of Cumberland
arrived at New-York on Friday the 4th
instant. She brings little or nothing of later
intelligence than by the arrivals in the De
laware. Some of the London papers by
her obliquely report. That the French at
Valenciennes, after having delivered up
the fortrefs, by the springing of a mine,
had effected a dreadful' (laughter among
the combined army. Such an event, how
ever improbable, may have happened, as
it is certain that subterraneous works
for some time engaged a department of
the besieged.

Mr. Clarkfon's answer to Mr. Broome was
precisely as follows,
" Sir, âYour letter of the 26th ult. was
not received by me until yesterday evening.
This delay was occasioned ty the general

and oppreflion ; the law delivered at the

the opinion of some, and I think it not im

able to subdue France, they will soon finda
pretext for going to war againfi America-
I observe, that they are fighting as much

government, are certainly as inimical to

" That the general government (or some

he requested a solution, viz.â"Why will
a Tub, with a Fifli in it, contain as much
water as it will without the fifli."
Many Academical pates were employed
in solving this difficult problem. Many
ingen<ous felutions were delivered in ; but,

' (lances in which Divine Providence
has displayed its iavor and protection to
the people of America, during the late war
with Great-Bri. ân, and the numerous ad
vantages we erjoy over all the nations of
the earth, must be convinced how little we
have deserved the repeated blefiings which
have been daily heaped on us, and how
juflly we have incurred the displeasure of
our Almighty BenefaÂ£tor. To the aflon
ifliment of the world, we repelled the force
of a powerful kingdom, who proudly
beaded itfelf to be tbe sovereign of the
ocean ; whose troops, in point of discipline
and courage, werefuppofed to be unequal
led, and compelled them to ackuovvledge
our independence. Shall we arrogate to
ourselves the praise due to our Omnipo
tent Prel'erver ?âWhen all the horrors of
war are pervading oiher countries, and
the blood of thousands spilled in defence of
liberty, and the equal rights of mail, we
have eilablilhcd our form of government
in a peaceable manner, and have experi
enced without interruption, the various be
nefits which have proceeded from its ad
ninillration. Is this to be imputed to out*
own wifdoni ? Shall the Supreme Ruler
of the Universe, who can raise up, and pull
down the nations of the earth at his plea
lure, be forgot,'Or (hall the glory which
ought to be ascribed to him, be given to
ourselves ? Remember, my countrymen,
the denunciation of an offended God against
the Children of Israel, for disobedience
and ingratitudeâ" The Lord (hall make

A malignant disorder hath for some time
prevailed among us ; its baneful etiects

Let us then, by a timely, and sincere re

PARIS, July 16.
Our c~ufe is an univerfn' one, and our
unparalltltd (trugglcs and fufferings malt
certainly excite the attention and ardent
good wilhes of tlie whole human race. Be.
nevolent minds are no doubt afflitteJ at
the effufion of human blood, but let them
remember, that the contelt in which we
are engaged, hss for its object nniverfal
an 1 perpetual peace. If we succeed in
establishing our principles in Europe, and
abolishing kingly government. 0 , we (h?ll
ce/tainly eradicate the principal causes
which have, for centuries, produced w;r
after war, and Itained our planet with the
blood of its inhabitants. Should our cause
fueceed, men would indeed be sensible of
their rights, and na longer fuffer their in
llrumentsof husbandry to be vvretled from
their hands, a death giving weapon placed
in their (lead, and then at the nod of an
impious tyrant, absurdly, fhamefully fuffer
themselves to be led, to cut the throats of
armher body of cultivators of the earth,
i 0 :iorant, innocent, slaves like themselves,
to whom they could give a fratern.il em
brace, at the very moment they are com
manded to deprive them of life ! Should
our principles take root in the world,
commerce and the intercourse between n't
tions would no longer be iubjetted to the
narrow and ridiculous policy, of avaricious
despots, who are always the most ignorant
of men with refpeft to the true interests of
civilized man. .But It is now certain, that
the age of light and reason is approaching,
the time so long wished for, by philoso
phers and philanthrop-.ile ; the agt of pre
judices, ignorance and tyranny is passing
away ; men begin to think and act for
themselves, our insulted and degraded fpe
cie3 rises at lalt, indignant, filled with as
tonishment that they have tamely crept at
the footltools of gods of their own mak
ing, for so many thousand years.
Some enemies to our happiness are at
this inflant oufily employed, in spreading
falfe and altered copies of the conltitution
through the whole extent of the Repub
lic But the Convention in their late Ad
dress to the People, " promise to watch
over it, and to follow it with an eagle's
eye, u.itil it arrives in all its purity at the
molt diltant cottage in the nation." The
Convention invites a 1 friends to Libeity,
to discover tiiefe fabricators of falfe laws.
" The monflers who are breaking the an
chor of propriety which has jult been
thrown in the mic.ft of the tempelt," and
entreats all good citizens to suspend their
judgments, until they fee the authentic co
pies, addreffe'd direiHy from the executive
council, to the communcs and constituted
authorities. The Convention fay they
â¢' cxpefted some such wicked at'empt, as
every grand epoch of the Revolution has
always suggested a new crime to ariilocracy
and royalty." "The success of our republi
an conltitution" fays the Address, is cer
tain; for if it had been " hurl ful to the people
and unfavourable to their rights, ariilocra
cy would never have attempted to alter it."
The Convention has decrced â¢' that the
punidiment of death (hall be inflidted on
any person who prints, fells or distributes
any falfified or altered copy of the Conlti
tution."
July 2T. The combined efforts of the
despots against us, have made us know
and feel our own strength and vast re
sources. "Our citizens so far from be rig
dismayed at the number and force 6f their
enemies, breathe nothing but revenge for
their infamous attempts againlt our (acred
freedom. The contempt of our soldiers
for the Aultrians, is hardly to be conceived.
(The Spaniards we count nothing.) The
king of Prussia's coffers are exhaulled, and
he mull soon quit. With refpeft to Eng
land, we may fay, "and thou too Brutus!''
The Englifli, that once free and generous
people, are now leagued with tyrants in a
libcrticide war. But we fear them not,
we wilh their happiness, and as a firlt step
towards it, the invasion of England is, at
length, firmly resolved on. It is no secret,
for if we will it, nothing can hinder us.
We (hall embark near the fame place where
our fierce and hardy anceflors did above
seven hundred years ago. Those irrefifta
ble conquerors who crofiing the narrow
sea, conquered and threw chains over the
English, and held their faces in the dull
for so many centuries. But our invasion
is totally different in its nature. We (hall
not land on their coast to enslave them,
but to break their chains, to humble their
tyrants, and restoreâto the nation, that
liberty, which a people, naturally so brave
and so high fpiritej, are entitled to enj' y."
The Tiger privateer has brought into
Brest, three Englilh vessels, which were
designed for the coait of Bretagne. One
of them haa on board a large sura of mo
ney.
â London, Augutl 15 â17.
Exirafl of a letter from Leghorn, July 18.
" The beginning of iaft week a despe
rate engagement happened off the illand of
Corsica, between an Algenne frigate and
one belonging to the French Republic ;
they fought with the greatest br very for
five hours, when night parted them ; the
next morning, at break of day, the con
flict was renewed with equal courage, and
the most determined o -ltinacy on both
fides, for Uj,wards of nine glaiTes, great
pi't of the time within pistol (hot of each
other, The Algerines made several at
tempts to board, but wete as often beat
off with great flaughrer, yet so damg and
resolute were the nirater, that they run
their fh;p along fide the French in spite
of ail resistance, and grappled them so fail,
that every effort to get clear was in vain :
the infidels immediately jump.d on board
fvvord in hand, swearing bit'erly, in seve
ral languages, they would conquer or die,
neither would they give or take quarter ;
the Republicans received them with great
spirit and resolution, when a most dreadful
carnage ensued, with fvvords, pistols, ja
velins, and lances, till at lad the French
were overpowered and o liged to flrike to
these terrible barbarians : the pirates loil
in hoth rencounters upwards of 100 men,
besides all iheir officers ; the boalfwain
was the last who had the command, this
fellow, altho' wounded in several parts of
the body, rcfufed to quit the deck, and
died as he wa3 encouraging tbe reft to
fight. The French mounted 30 guns, and
the Algerines 28, besides peteraros, and
thetf were both in such a Shattered condi
tion that it wa3 next to an impoffibihty
either of them could reach Algiers.
" P S. The Algerine Captain was (hot
through the head in the height of the ac
tion, as he was nailing the colours to the
mast ; and the firft and second lieutenants,
who were both his sons, shared the fame
fate soon after ; it was alio reported that
they both funk the next day, and what
remained of the crews were taken up by a
Tunisian bark, ana carried into Tunis."
War/aw, July 20. The fate of Poland
fecms unchangeably fixed. On Monday
the 15th day of July the deputies held
their second conference with the Ruffian
ambaffatlor, and delivered to him a memo
rial, which they requested hitn to forward
to the empress. This he absolutely refuf
ed to do, and in a note which he sent to
the Diet, accompanied by menaces, he
infilled on the signature and ratification
of the treaty of alliance and commerce
between Russia and the Republic, and that
the deputies fhoukl be invelted with ful;
powers to do the tame.
In the felfion of the fame day (the 15th)
when this note vva3 read, the Diet con
sented to the prorogation of the session
till the 30th inft. but refufed to comply
with the willies of the Ruffian ambafTador
rcfpe&ing the treaty of alliance. This
treaty, a plan of which the deputies pre
sented on that day to the Diet, conlifts
of ten articles, and contains some advan
tages at the expence of some faerifices.
! he Polish nation may chufe the form of
government which it conceives bed adapt
ed to its interests, except that of the 3d of
May, 179 1 ; but the basis of the advanta
ges to be granted to Poland is the com
plete and full ratification of the treaty of
partition between the courts of Peterf
burgh and Berlin, in its full extent, as
was required on the 9th of April.
In conftquence of the refufal of the
Diet to accede, the Ruffian ambassador or.
the 16th sent a note tantamount to a for
mal declaration of war. He said in this
note, that unless the deputies were invert
ed with the authority required on the
17th, he (hould lay the eftaUs, possessions,
and habitations of the members of the Di
et, under a military execution ; and (hould
the king adhere to the oppoiite party, the
royal domains would be treated in the fame
manner.
The Diet, in consequence of these me
naces, by the advice of the king, who saw
with grief the danger of a vain refinance,
at length yielded, and the resolution was
carried by a majority of 69 to 20 ; but a
number of proieftj were entsred on the
occasion; Poland must therefore submit to
its fi.?e, amidit the absolute silence cf all
Europe.
The city of G'odno 13 closely Mocked
up by foreign troops, and no one can quit
ihe city wiibout a pr.Tport from the Ri.fii
an ambafiador, net even to t; ke a walk.
Count de Sievers has offered the foreign
minillera their palTport, but the diplomv
tic coips have rtfufed his uifer3, aj contrary
to the liberties and respect due to their
chaiatter.
No information whkh we should tli'nk
it prudent to rely upon has yet found its
way to us with regard to the dtligns of
the Prussian or combined arnifes. They
are probably cor cealtd with great indullry,
as nothing can so much hairafii the French
force! or divide their atteniion, as the ge
neral ftatc of uncertainty in which all par
tes seem at present to remain. On the
22d of July there was a very serious action
in the neighbourhood of Landau, in which
the French, if we are to give credit to the
conquerors, left five thousand d>:ad upon
the field of battle. By their movements
subsequent to this defeat, if appears that
their immediate apprehensions are for I hi
onville, the chief town of French Luxem
bourg, and a fort*efs of confiderabl<
(Irengtb, which, it may be remembered,
signalized itfelf in the lad campaign by a
v.-rry gallant defence under Gen. Wimpfen,
now commander in chief of the French
forces in opposition to the Convention.
