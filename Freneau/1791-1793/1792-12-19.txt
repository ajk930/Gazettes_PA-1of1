[Numb. 15 of Vol. ll.] WEDNESDAY, December 19, 1792.
The following address from the society oj
Quakers for Pennsylvania, New jferTey,
Delaware, and part of Maryland and
Virginia, wis read in Congress on the
19* Aof November.
To the President, Senate, and House of
P-cprefentatives of the United States.
The address of the people called Quakers-
IT was the exhortation of the Apostle
Paul, that supplications, prayers, in
terceflions, and giving thanks, be made
for all men ; for kings and for all that
arc in authority, that we may lead a qui
Â«t and peaceable life, in all goodness and
honeitv, for this is good and acceptable
in the light of God our Saviour," con
formable whereto, our mind 3 have been
brought into a religious concern, that the
rulers of this land may pursue such mea
sures as may tend to the promotion of
the peace and happinefa of the people.
We are sensible that the Lord's judg
ments are in our land, and being deeply
affe&ed at the diitreffed fituatioa of the
frontier inhabitants, we desire a solid and
careful enquiry may be madeintothecaufe;
and are firmly persuaded that if the coun
sel and dire&ion of the Holy Spirit is
waited for and followed, the divine blef
ling will crown the labours of those who
Uprightly engage in the work of peace.
The disposition which has appeared in
the government to promote pacific inea
fureawith the Indians, hath we believe
been generally acceptable ; and as it is
conftftent with our religious principles,
so it has been our uniform care to ad;no
nifliand caution our member* againlt fet
tling on lauds which have not been pur
chased of the original owner; and as far
as our influence extends, we mean to
maintain this our ancient testimony invio
late, which from experience has been
found effectual to the pretervation of
peace with the natives, who, with great
hospitality, cherilhed and afiifted our
forefathers in their early settlement of
this country.
We feel cautious not to move out of
oar proper line, but being interested in
the welfare of this country, and convinced
â of the expedience of further endeavours
being used to encourage the Indians to
come forward with a full reprefentalion
and statement of their grievances, and
that every just cause of uneasiness in their
minds may be fully investigated and re
moved : we apprehend it our duty
again to address you on this affeÂ£ling
and important occasion ; under a belief
that nothing (liort of flridt jullice will
ever be a balls of solid and lading peace.
We refpeÂ£tfully submit these things to
your serious confederation ; earnestly de
iiring that through the influence of di
vine wisdom in your councils, you may be
made inltrumental to prevent the further
effufion of human blood, and that the in
habitants may long enjoy the blefiing of
a righteous government.
Signed in and on behalf of a meeting
appointed to represent our religious
society in Pennsylvania, New-Jer
sey, Delaware, and part of Mary
land and Virginia, held in Philadel
phia the 17th day of the nth month
1792.

EVERY good citizen of a govern

upon the information of a young gentle

five of these productions are al eady up

whether these things were acceptable or

From the American Daily AdverTl.
ser of lajl Monday.
Mr. Dunlap,
IN reading over the law of the National
Legiilature, suspending, for t!ie term ol
:wo years, the operation of the limitation
aws passed by the Congress of 1785, and
1787, I find a moll pitiful,fhamefuland no*
'orious violation of the molt solemn and in
:erefling contracts and engagements evei
entered into by any government on earth;
apon the performance of which, 011 the
part of the patriot eontradtees, the eftab
lilhment and exiltence of that very go
vernment solely depended, and which it is
conceded, on every hand, by the late a
well as the present government, that they
faithfully and fuccefsfully performed ; and
that they have been almost the onlyTuffet -
ers by the revolution, no one, [ trust, wil
be so 101 lto a sense of jultice and truth
as to deny.
After acknowledging the justice, am'
admitting the propriety of liquidating ant
adjulling the fair and equitable claims or
the public, which have not been fettled
and decreeing in express and unequivoca
terms, " that every officer, (of course of
ficers of every denomination is clearly un
derltood) soldier, artificer, sailor, anc
marine, having claims for perfonil service*
rendered to the United States, in the mi
litary or naval departments, who fiiall ex
hibit the fame for liquidation at the Trea
sury of the United States, at any time
during the aforefaid term, lhall be en
titled to an adjustment, and an allowance
thereof, on the fame principles, as if the
fame had been exhibited -within the terms pre
scribed by the aforefaid limitations." Here
then, after this much laboured clause,
vaunting of jultice, ulhers in the following
unjutt, inconfiftcnt; and undignified provi-
so : " That nothing thereirf shall be con
ft rued to extend to claims for rations o
subsistence-money." I a(k were ration*
& subsistence-money not a part of the pub
lie contrail, as well as the immediate pay:
Were these not given in lieu of greatei
pay? And is thi3 not the cafe with al
armies of whatsoever nation, even our owr
present army not an exception ? Where
these are not supplied, an equivalent in mo.
ney is allowed by all nations we are ac
quainted with. And why, then, in tin
name of common sense, should not thai
part of the late public contradl be as lion
orably discharged as any other ? Glarino
inconliaency ! Is it not difgraceful, and
does it not throw the moll dilhonorablc
reflections on our government, to violate
a solemn contra#, a sacred engagement.
For so trifling a pittance, which in private
ife would be spurned and hilTed at ? Be
sides, it is a daring infringement of the
ronftitution (the only barrier we have far
aur rights and liberties) as well as a vi
olation of the public contradl. For the
present government was adopted with the
lole view of establishing juftiee ; and a
:laufc thereof secures and confirms to eve
ry citizen his right, and expressly declares,
:hatâ" all debts controlled, and engage'
meats entered into, before the adoption of the
fami, Jhall be as valid a vain ft the Ur.ited
States under the present Con/litution at un
ier the Confederation."
The headsofthe executive departments,
f am told, have also undertaken to put a
â¢onftruflion upon the suspension law, I
jelieve, never contemplated by Congress,
nz. that it does not extend to the ofE
:ers and servants of the late military hof.
pitals for personal service rendered the
United States : That because military
tiofpitals are not expressly mentioned, and
jnly army and navy, or military and na
sal departments (as if military hofpitah
were not a part of these eftablifhmeuts}
theycanie not within the provision of the
ift. Whereas the intention of Congress
in palling the fufpenlion law, appears tc
â ne, was to extend mdifcriminate relief tc
ill the late servants of the public, for per.
lonal service rendered the United States
during the war, in whatsoever capacity
:hat were precluded by the limitations ol
:he late Congress. If otherwise, I have
10 doubt, Congress, from a sense of duty ;
,vill immediately remedy the defect, in or
ier to prevent their valuable time being
[pent in reading the petitions frem indi
iriduals of the late military hospital, whose
:afes may comc undar the Operation oi
the limitations heretofore eftablilhed.â
This circumllance leads me to remark
that our laws ought to be framed in the
plainest and moll intelligible language
devoid of any manner ofambiguiry in or
der to prevent mifconftrucliou. Sounc!
tinderllandings, from motivfi of policy
is well as utility, need only to be inform
sd to correct errors and millakes. A dif
:erning public will not reft fatisfied undei
srronpousconftrudlionsor inequitable laws
ior tamely fubmic to an infringement ol
their rights. However small thepittance
it may hereafter be pleaded as a prece
dent, and from smaller, pass to matters o
greater importance in the rights ofAme
rican cieizens.
We have reserved to ourselves the righi
as thinking fptaiing and writing upon thi
proceedings of the servants of the people
and we will exercise this, our natural a:
well as our political right, freely wherievei
iuft occasions oifcr.

[Continued frem our Paper of the 12th in-
Jlant.]}
IT is said that few nations are capable
of preserving their freedom ; and this is
generally attributed toa lack of knowledge
and information in ths people : But if
[Total No. 119.]
ignorance is so universally deilruftive of
liberty, does it not afford us an indispu
table, though melancholy proof, of tl.e
univeifal depravity of the rulers of man.
kmd ; for if rulers were honest, and
would make the peace, interests, and pros
perity of the people the sole end and aim
of their condiifl, they would lead them,
however ignorant, to freedom and hap.
pinefs ; and we should not fee the great
bulk of mankind reduced to misery and
wretchednefa to support the idle pomp
and pageantry of courts, so absurdly cal
led the dignity of government.
The wretched condition of the people
in almost every part of the globe, is a
convincing proof, that there exitts in eve
ry country, a kind of natural aristocracy,
aspiring, ambitious, enemies to
freedom, scorning the idea of Equality,
looking down upon the people as an in
fenor order of beings, and improving eve
ry opportunity, pel fas et nel'as, toexalt
themselves above their fellow citizens.
Againlt the art 3 and deiigns of these
misanthropists or conspirators againfl
he freedom and happiness of mankind,
:he people must have the knowledge and
ivifdom to guard and defend themselves,
>r they cannot preserve their liberties.
Let U3 not fuffer ourselves to be led
iway by the dangerous delusion, that wc
>avÂ« no fueh chara&ers amongst us ;
eit we give occasion fbr taking up over
:he people of this country, the pathetic
amentation mifcle by heaven over the Jew*
if old ; "O! my peopirj ttieT which lead
:hee, cause thee to err, and deltroy thp
Â»ay of thy paths." Fordo not our dai
y publications teem with produdions,
:ending to lead us into the most danger
>us errors ? Have not manj of those very
:haraÂ£ters, who so lately joined us, in op
jofing and expelling a foreign tyranny,
.vhich stood equally in the way of our
lappinefs, and their own ambition, been
:or some time differisinating principles and
jurfuiug measures deftru'dtive of the for
mer and promotive of the latter* ?
Wnen we obtained peace and the acknow
edgment ofour independence from Great-
Britain, our contest for liberty was but
lalf over, it itill remained to be determin
ed which fliould enjoy the fruits of the
aftory, the people, or their leaders ; that
s, whether the revolution fliould confer
r reedom and happiness upon all, or only
:ontribute to the power and aggrandize
ment of the few.
Hence it is by no means wife or fafe
to trull men merely for what they have
been, during the late revolurion ; but we
tnuft determine their characters by what
they have been since that period, and what
they now are. Many were with us du
ring the war, who are not for u3 now.
The times are changed, and we are chan
ged with them, ai f d tho' it may be diffi
cult, yet I trust it is not irr.poflibie to dis
tinguish these changelings from the honelt
friends of freedom ; many symptoms by
which they may beknown may be collec
ted from that excellent piece in the Na
tional Gazette of the 12th inft. intitled
"Forerunners of monarchy and aristocracy
in the United States," to which 1 wilÂ£
venture to add one, which I think will
not lead into any mistakes of characters,
which is,that he who endeavours to de
ceive the people in points on which it is
of importance for them to be well inform
ed, cannot be their friend : and here I will
once more take the liberty to introduce a
gentleman of the above description, I
mean the writer in Mr. Bache's Adverti
ser of the 4th inltant, who ligns himfel?
Otfego. This writer after endeavouring
to persuade us that an avowed advocatc
for monarchy, may be more fafely trusted
in the administration of the government
of the United States, than one who has
uniformly advocated republican fyf.
tem, goes on in his second paragraph and
fays " Though the chief n\9giftrate of aK
important stale in tha union, he (meaningGovernor Clinton) has flood forth the a
vowecl advocate of hoitils opposition to
that government which lie has sworn to
fuppjft," and to the liite purpose -he fays
in his last paragraph, " shall hewhofe con
ltant endeavours, are directed to over
throw our excellent conlfitution, wiio
threatened to draw his sword in oppolition
to it, be chol'en to fill the lecond oriice un
der it ?" Here I confefs I am at a loss for
a suitable answer, our language does not
afford words fuiliciently severe to reou.ie
him with the asperity he deserves, nor
black enough to paint such conduct in a
public writer. Good God! T antunine
animo hunlaiio viius ? Exists Aich venom
in a human heart ? Is it possible that such
groundlefi calumny, such aiiaffiaation of
ciiaratter, should 'proceed from a pen
which sets out with so much pretended
tenderneis for charatter, as to accule Mr.
Ad tnii's opponents of calumny, merely for
quoting his own acknowledged fenfiments
a-iiii'l him? Is it poiiible that we can be
miltaken in marking this man as an ene
my to our freedom, who has thus attempt
ed to deceive us by politive fallhood in
anatlair waich he admits is ofmuch impor
tances oiircounfy? I lhallnow endeavour
to Ihew, though it is hard to prove a nega
tive, that this is one of those many fall
hoods, which have been invented, and
propagated agaimt that good man, by the
virtuous partizans of Ariitocracy, who in
their at zeal and hurry to enlighten our
underltandings, and thereby enable us to
fup:)ort our liberty, often forget that any
regard is due either to truth or decency.
, o far has Governor Clinton been from
ever avowing an hofYile oppolition to the
government oi the United states, that he
was perhaps thefirft man in the United
States, who publicly avowed his determi
nation to support it ; which I am inform
ed he did in a solemn, public manner be
fore a whole people assembled in their le
prefentatives, at the moment of its adop
tion. This is a fact, which can be incon
teftibly proved. Mr. Hamilton, or Mr.
Jay, if requested, I believe, could eithei
of the*n certify the truth of
And I call Upon Mr. Otfego or any one
else, to make it appear that Governor
Clinton ever threatened, either before or
since the adoption of the conflitution, to
draw his sword in oppolition to it. And
I am fully persuaded, that since its adop
tion, his molt ingenious enemies would be
puzzled to point out any part of his con
duct, which can be called unfriendly to it.
And so far in my opinion ought we to be
from confideringhim as an enemy to the
conflitution, that we ought, as we vvifh to
perpetuate the bleflings of freedom in our
country, and to fe-ure our poÃerity from
that mis ry and wretchedness, under
which man i; made to groan in every other
part of the world, by tne luxury, the pride
and the oppreliion of their rulers, to
pray to God, tha the government of the
United States, may ever be administered
by jll ft such enemies to it as Governor
Clinton is.
I shall make but one more remark at
thistime, which is, that those who endea
vour, either by a diiiimulation of their own
or a misrepresentation of the char ait en ol
others, to deceive the people at elections,
are, and ought to be coniidered, as more
dangerous enemies to their liberties, than
those who are in open arms ngainfl them.

FRANCE, Oftoberi.
Letter from the commifTioners tent tc
Chalons, dated St. Menehould, Sept. 30.
at nine in the evening; addressed to the
National Convention :â" In cur last let
ter we gave you an account of our arrival
at the army of General Dumourier, and oi
the effeÂ£t produced 011 it by a notificatior.
of the wife decrees which you have alrea
dy pa(Ted. We now announce to you thai
we have jufl received intelligence, that the
king of Prussia has raised the camp whicli
he had about a league from us; from the
polition in which it was, General Dumou
rier forefaw, that the enemy could nol
long keep their polition in the midst of the
de.'ert plains of Champaigne, and withoul
having any communication through whict
they could receive convoys but toward:
Grand Pre.
Some days ago General Dumourier dis
patched General Buernonville with a bod)
of 13,000 men, to intercept this communi
cation, and that general, distinguished for
his activity, zeal and ability, succeeded ir
getting pufiefllon of several considerable
convoys. He likewise took more than 10c
prisoners, who arrived successively in the
course of the day. All accounts agree in
certifying the extreme diflrefs to which
the army of the enemy is reduced ; and
General Dumourier formed a very jufl
idea of their situation, when he informed
you that they could not remain long in
it.
" It can scarcely be believed that expe
rienced generals fliould have penetrated
intd the defarts of Champaigne, had they
not entertained a vain hope that they should
be seconded in their operations by a crimi
nal correspondence with the mal-contents;
but the memorable day of the icth has
proved, that the French, while they com-
bat for liberty, will perish rather than con
tent to any capitulation. The general,
ilaily informed of details which proved
their distress, properly judged that by pre
serving their iituation, they would dellroy
tli- eftect of any movements which they
might attempt. This army, so iormida
ble, is reduced one halt by its lick whom
they were obliged to ieiul away to Grand
Pre. It is well known that there is a ge
neral hufpital in that town, in which there
is more than 8000. Had General Duinou
rier abandoned his position and advanced
towards Chalons or Rheims, they would
infallibly have taken advantage oi his
movement, not to attack us but to pass
through the defile, and to eftablilh can
tonments for the purpole of palling the
winter in one of the molt fertile countries.
His constant perseverance has obliged
them, last night, to make a movement en
tirely contrary to that which he expefl
ed.
" They have quitted their poll', and the
communication between Chalons and St.
Menc-hou'd is now re-eftablilhed. which
gives the French army 15 hours for the ar
rival of convoys and provilions. Ardour
and fatisfaCtion prevail among our troops,
and our lituation was never lb advantage
ous as at prei'ent. The lirft movement
which the enemy made indicates that they
wilh to retire through the defile of Grand
Pre, the only pall'sge which remains to
:hein.
" We Ihall not enter into any details
refpefting the future plans of General Du
mourier, but we think it our duty to in
form you, that the utmott confidence ought
:o be reposed in him ; that the people of
Paris need be in no uneaiinefs, and tint
we hope in our next to give you Hill more
Satisfactory intelligence. People ought
not, however, to exult in that fuccef.
which the fate of war may reverie ; but
we are able at present to give hopes, wh ch
,-efult from the certain diltrefi of cur ene
my, and the diseases by which they ait
weakened ; from the excellent condition
;f our troops, and from the ardor whieli
; hey shew to combat those tyrants, who
ivilh to impose law's upon them, as well as
"roin the confidence which they have in

.4 Utter from the Minister for Foreigr,
Affairs, to the National Convention.
Paris, October 1.
" Citizen Frefidentâl announced to the
National Convention that overtures for t
legociation had been made in the name ol
the king of Pruliia to General Dumourier.
1 mentioned at the fame time the decilior
â¡f the executive power, which orderec
the Generals not to liiten to the proposal:
until the armies of del'pots had firft evacu
ated the land of liberty. The proposals ol
the king of Pruliia were however remark
able, aÂ» they contained a precise acknow
ledgment of the national authority, and ol
the quality of representative of the natioi;
in external relations which had been at
tached formerly to the political exiftenct
of the constitutional king. Another ac
knowledgment, no less remarkable, was,
that the ancient order of things, deltroyeci
by the will of the nation lince 1789, was
contrary to the happiness of the people.
" Such an unexpected acknowledgment,
spontaneously made, without any previous
negociation, might incline 11s to think that
the enemies armies are in the greatest dis
tress. There are, however, other mo
tives equally prefiing, which make them
think of peace. Akind of truce was agreed
upon. Gen. Dumourier took advantage
of it, to collect, and properly dispose, the
different bodies which v. ere to be joined
to his army. He made in quietness, and
with lilence, all those movements which
were necettary to give him a
by his situation, and to confine the enemy
IP. theirs. While he was thus preparing
lor his military plans, frequent communi
cations, that could not but be advantage
ous to liberty, we're established between
the two armies. General Dumourier em
braced this opportunity of exchanging pri
: oners of war. The cartel agreed upon
with the Pruilian Generals was formed ac
cording to the laws decreed by the Nati
onal Allenibly- The emigrant pr:fonen
were not included in it, and the Duke oi
Brunfwick did not even persist in a remon
tirance, which he had made in their fa
vor.
A conference on this occalion took
ulace between the Duke of Brunfwick,
Count de Luchefini, minister o the king
of Prullia, and lieutenant-colonel adjutant
general Thouveilot, who was charged with
ionduÂ£ting the exchange ot prisoners. In
this conference, the Duke ot Brunfwick
?xpreli'ed himfelf almost in the following
terms:
" Our nations are not formed to be ene-
Tiies : might not fame means be devised
for accommodating matters in an amica
jle manner? We are in your country âit
s desolated by the inevitable misfortune:
>f war ; we know that we have no right
:o prevent a nation from giving itielf
aws, and from tracing out its internal go
/ernment âwe do not wilh itâwe are on
y interested for the fate of the king. Af
ure us, that a place will be alligued tc
lim, in the new order of things, under am
lenomination whatever, and his majefly,
:he king of P.uilia, will return to hisou 1
fates, and become your ally."
'â¢ The moderation of this language, frorr
i man who signed the manifeltoes ulreadj
published, and to which the contempt oi
.he French nation has done ample juitice
null appear surprising.
" Lieutenant Colonel Thouvenot repli
ed, " that the will of the French ; cpublu
would not yield to any foreign influence,
ind that the reprtfentatives ot the nation,
;o whom the valuable depolit ot its honoi
md glory was particularly entrusted, woulc
:ontinuaily perliit in maintaining decree;
which had been functioned by general opi
lion."
'â¢ The Duke of Brunfwick terminatec
:he conference, by faying that he woulc
:ranfinit to Gen. Dumourier a memoria
311 the subject. This memorial is a thirc
manifetlo, worthy in every thing of tht
:wo former. Gen. Dumourier receivet
it with indignation, in which we lhare, anc
rthich nrnlt alio be excited in the Nationa
Convention, and in all France.
; It wa > immediately announced that thi
:ruce was broken, and letters from tht
jeneral, written in a Itile suited to a mai
louored with the nobl*> employment ol
:onducting t renchinen to liberty, procuret
in answer from the king ot Prussia's aid
de-can;p, Hating, that the intentions o:
:he king and of the Duke of Brunfwicl
tad been misunderstood ; that a new con
Terence was demanded ; and that the roya
and imperial armies would not be ths
tirft to break the. truce. Cen. Dumou
rier refufed to consent to any new confer
ence, or any delay in the operations ot til:
campaign, unlefsthe memorial oi the Luitt
of Brunfwick should be firll annulled.â
Such is the actual Hate ot things 'â  \Â» liai
patted during that circumstance, w ill ihew

A Captain from the port of New-Lon

her aid to the brave sons of Neptune, by

In the lart Chronicle, we had the honor
3f communicating to the enlightened free

uinours, so carefully and indilftrioufly cir
culated in England and America, of the
uppofed misfortunes of our Gallic friends,
ind illustrious coadjutors in the glorious
.aufe of freedom. In this, we offer (and
t is with great pleafurc we can do it) a
full confirmation, not only of the agreea
ble intelligence contained in our lait; but
as a prefpeft being opened, at least of an
sntire evacuation of France, by the invad

as a free and happy cor.fHtution to that
jallant and generous people. That this
may be the event, may God almighty
jrant !
In addition to the Paris accounts, we
:an allure our readers, on the authority of
Captain [Voodrobe, an intelligent observer,
who came pafi'enger in the velfel from
I unkirk, and who is abundantly capable
of knowing, from his long residence in

A correspondent cannot but remark,
how " circumstances ajter cases." Those
who are now lamenting the hard lot of the
Secretary at War, that he cannot be heard
viva voce before Congress, were highly
("upporting certain dignified charatters
when the heroic MORGAN, was denied
a trial on the spot, where he could pro
duce fubflantial evidence of the truths he
afl'erted, and was ordered hundreds of miles
into the wilderness for the purpose. Let
not then the Secretary at War complain of
" exparte evidence."
Perhaps nothing can be more pernicious,
than an obsequious difpolition to a blind
commendation, of the measures of any
government : It is enquiry, criticism, and
scrutiny, which inform, inllruft and im
prove. The aÂ£tion of laws upon public
opinion, and the re-nftion of that opinion
upon government, is the criterion, by
which to judge of the wi'ilom, the policy,
or the folly of political measures: Whilst
a due attention is paid to thefc* correspond
ent refleÂ£tions, of the government upon
the people, and of the people upon the
government, the public confidence will be
inspired, and increased, and the knowledge
of legislation enlarged and improved,HARTFORD, Dec. 10.

We are informed that some of the elec

New-York, recommending Gov. Clinton
as a proper man for Vice-Preiident. The
writers of those letters, and all their ad
herents, may be alfiired, that this and eve
ry other attempt to influence the people ol
this (late in their elections, will excite nc
small degree of refentinent. The faction:
of N.-w-Yorkhad better keep their undiu
influence, their cabals and their corrup
tion, among the:nfelves, and not attemp!
, to spread them among the quiet and inde
pendent electors and freemen of Connec
ticut. Any attempt of this kind deserve:
severe reprobation ; but an attempt u
persuade our electors to vote for Governor
Clinton, a man of moderate political ta
lents, and a lteady active enemy to the con
dilution of the United States, is a vcr]
open affront to the citizens oi this stateâ
A man too who is at the head of a part)
in New-Yorkâand it is a sacred truth
that the leaders of popular factions are al,
tyrants at heart. Governor Clinton ia in

political talents and information, weighet

A critical view of Parties ill relation to
the contest between Mr. Adams and Go
vernor Clinton.
The Party for Mr. Adams consisted of,
i â¢ A certain description and combination
well known to be attached to a govern
ment of king, lords, and commonsâThe
activity and constancy of this corps may be
counted on in all future cases.
2. Federalists, governed more by party
lames and prejudices, than by a regard to
the principles of the constitution itfelf, as
'.lie test of its real friends and adversariesâ
This class mull daily decrease, as reafou
jets the better of pallion and error.
3. Republicans uninformed of Mr. Aâ's
political principles, or the neceifity of ar
resting their progress in the government â
This class mult in like manner decrease, as

jjblic affairs is diffufed.

BEING in company, a few days since
the conversation was on the trouble:
which the French are involved in Th<
condudl of Petlon, the grsat republicar
ind mayor of Pans, was loaded with cv;.
ry execrable epithet. This naturally lec
me to ask what that great man had done
The reply was, he has bsen the moil ac
tive agent to dethrone the king, and by
that event the Germans, emigrants, &c,
under the Duke of Brunfwick, were with
rapidity advancing to Paris. This, if fad,
is a fad story, and even in this day of mote
general liberality in politics and religion,
in the opinion of Britons, to lift a hanÂ£
against the Lord's anointed, is a crime oi
the blacked dye.âl endeavored to defend
the condtift of the mayor, but I fount:
the ft ream against me : One of the com
f>any whom_ I formerly refpefted, ob
served, that it was better for a nation tc
submit to the arbitrary mandates of
nobles and pritfts, than hazard the rifqÂ°uc
and troubles which ensue on all revolu.
tions of government. This doctrine, al
though rchfhed by a major part of the
company, I conceive to be dangerous, and
luch as every American should spurn at.
The French are a brave and magnani
mous nation, and every principle of grati
tude and honor, call on us to be inlercfted
in their establishing ? free and federal go
vernment, the great wirti and object
â >f the mayor of Paris, afiifted by his zea
lous friends, the Jacobins, who will rif<
Tuperior to the " times which try mens :
fouls;" and like the immortal patriot!
if America, who never calculated thepovver,
wealth and trouble in contending with
G. Britain,butkeeping thegreat object evei
in view, in prosperity and adversity, flea
aily persevered: Such [ apprehend to be the
diarafters of the National Assembly, the
mayor and Jacobins.âConvinced that the
jffedlions of Lewis XVI. his court, the
noblesse, and clergy, are corrupt, depra
ved and treacherousâthat under a con-
Ititution and form of government, which
made him the greatest prince in Europe
and enabled his court to be the firil in
rank and splendor, still they beheld the
dreadful effeds of arbitrary principles, in
viting a few inifcreants, rebels and trai
tors to a country which gave them birth,
to invade the kingdom ; assisting with the
bounty of munificence, of a great nation,
the major part of the immense sums which
they had allotted to his support and gran
deur, in paying those murderers, and, aid
ed by the Auftrians, Prussians, &c. who are
with fire and sword, carrying on the war
desola tion and death, in the fineft coun
try on earth, destroying the helpless, aged
and infirmâwarring against a nation
who never offended them_who, agreea
ble to the laws of God and nature are
only defending thezafsjves, and who, faith-
to their treaties, have in our days beer
prodigal of their blood and treasure, tc
erve their allies in their days of distress

pel these rapacious invadersâto defem
their country-, their wives and children
we behold them laying plots of the deep

Sketch of theprefen: situation ox Vermont
THE rapid settlement and growirr
importance of Vermont, is one of the mofl
lingular instances of the benefit and valu<
of abilities, enterprize and industry, b;
which a wilderness may be made a fruit
Ful field ; and where towns and villagesâ
where churches, schools, and colleges
wliere polished manners and well regulate<
society, may be exchanged for the dart
:?aunts of savage hearts and savage men
rom darkness to light in religionâf r0 n
:.ie gloom of ignorance to the bright cheer
ing sun-shine of knowledge.
Not thirty years ago, the territory o
Vermont was an uncultivated wild a nelc
.or speculation and land-jobbing, anions
the royal governments of New-York anc
New-Hampshire. She is now delivered
from the contention of those imperious
matters, nd filled with inhabitants, whofc
abilities enterprize, and patriotism, are no,
â¢quailed by any jlatc in the Union. Her in
habitants are composed of men who dif
Jained to be poor, and confined to tlu
("mall Wivifion of a little patrimonial inhe
ritanco. They have emigrated with theii
rvives and children and become indeoen
lent farmers and country gentlemen Re
Tpeftable as rulers and legislatorsâ respec
table in wealth and members. In ever
quarter of it, the traveller meets men an'
women of the best character and education
Irving in a molt refpeÂ£lable stile, acquainted
with their own country, encouraging in.
duflry, and aflilh'ng in building places o;
public worship, and planting schools.
Wheat and cattle, the flaple of Ver
raont, are annually sent in large quanti
ties into the other states and the BritiCr
provinces, having a large farp: i;3 besides
the supplying their inhabitants and nen
settlers.
Mad was that policy, which wished tc
fever Vermont from New-Hampshire
Hiitory will record and posterity laugh at
the leaders of the latter who refitted the
application of the former when (he request
ed to be united with them as one itatc
But happy was the decision for the profpe
nty of that hardy, resolute, and refpedla
ble territory. A magiilrate, representative,
or citizen, in Vermont, is equally venerable
with a similar officer in any other state,
They govern a wife, judicious, virtuous
and wealthy yeomanry, who enjoy a li
berty as pure as the air they breathe, whioh
â  s not exceeded on this globe. Health
reignsâand cheerfulnefs and vigor, those
greatest of earthly treasures, are the result
or their happy climate, happy govern
ment, and the noble spirit of its inhabit
tants.
This is not the fanciful rhapfoay of one
who indulges imaginationâ a visit into the
willfhow all to be facts.

Perhaps there is no science more entertaining
and ufeful than geography. Ic reveals the dis
coveries of travellersâthe remarkable curiosities
ot ail countries, in nature and artâthe situati
on of provinces, cities, towns villages, rivers,
and mountainsâin fine, the hillorv, manners,
cuSorfts, laws, forces, revenues, and government
ofdliferent nations.
It is an old observation, that " there is not a
son or daughter of Adam, but has forne concern
with geography," and that a knowledge of this
science is indiipenfable towards the itudy of hitâ
tory with advantage or fatisfaflion. Indeed a
mart unacquainted with it, cannot discourse on
the nmoit common topic of the day
without betraying his ignoiance.
So much for geography generally. With rrf
peÂ£t to the present plan, let it futfice ta re'mark,
thatC utfcrie's Geography has been long acknow
ledged to be the belt in the Engiilh language;
however, the account of America in it has, from
obvious reafonj, been very erroneous and defec
tive. Ttieerrois of former eoitions will be cor
rected, and the defects fuppiied, by gentlemen of
abilities, who have engaged to superintend thia
undertaking, and tp avail themselves of all the
information that can be procured, to render ic
the molt complete edition extant.
The Printer earnestly foliciu the support of
his tellow citizens throughout the United Statea :
and Hi no depoiit is required, and every fubferi
berwill bo at liberty t> withdraw his name, if,
on trial, he Ihould disapprove of the work, he
hopes tiie fiiends ot science, and of American art#
and manufactures will cheerlolly and early pat
ronize this ufeful work, the gieatelt aud mofc
expensive, probably, ever yet attempted in Ame
rica, in the t-ypograpic-l Jin?, tha Â£ucyclopÂ«Edi.
