To the Freemen oj Pennsylva n ia.
r Â£ IHE present mode of eleding mem-
JL beis of Congress, which has been
introduced by the aris and perseverance,
of some ambitious chara&ers in the city of
Philadelphia, is calculatcd to lead you
into a choice of persons, for the guardians
of your political rights and interests, in
whom (as you have no knowledge of their
principles or their conduit) a well found
ed confidence cannot be reposed. While
the llate was divided into diitrids, every
part enjoyed a fair proportion of the re
prefentarion ; and every elector, from his
own observation and experience, could
estimate the comparative merits of the can
didates. There was little room for cabal,
Or fadion ; a combination of interests in
One quarter,could not defeat the choice o 1
the Freemen in another ; nor was it neces
sary to secure the benefit of de&ion thro 1
the medium of an odious comprornife, bj
which at a board of conference (that fata
market for the rights of fuffrage 1) the ac
ceptance of a stranger, whom you nevei
saw, or a tory, whom you never loved,
may be made the price and condition ol
the bargain.
In orJer, however, as far aS possible, tc
obviate the difficulties of the lituation ir
which we are thus involved, let us, ni)
fellow-citizens, not only freely propose thi
candidates, but freely investigate their me
rits. My present objed is to call your at
tention, not merely to names, but to chs
raders ; & in a concife,but,l hope, 3 satis
factory manner, to bring to your recollec
tion men and principâ â¢ s, that ought to b.
forever dear to the whigs and republican
of Pennsylvania. The times are changed
it is true, but you are not changed wit!
th'-m. You fee elevated into great officia
diflindion, many, who did not dare to ap
pear in public view, at the period whic'
" tried men's fouls and an attempt i
now made to dazzle you with that blazi
of wealth, which the fruitful agencies o
the war, and the rank Speculations 01 th,
fuads, have mere mysteriously than honed
ly accumulated in the hands of individuals
But you are not by such circumstances tc
be awed into silence, or deluded into fla
very. The spirit of the revolution is no'
dead, though perhaps it fleepeth. Thofi
minds which the fp.'endor, the power, the
influence, and the corruption of the Bri
tifh monarchy could not captivate, subdue.
or contamii at , must be iu;... lor to th.
arrogance of an upirart arMosracy, th<
machinations of the inveterate fu. . :o in
depe dence, and the foothirt; 1 of thoU
crafty politicians, who aim at a monopo'j
of power.

description of men, will i'peik for itfelf ;
and 1 think it of more importance, as well
as a more agreeable taflc, to point out t!,.

than thole that ought to be rejected. With

low citizens to encounter tlie monarchi
cal outrages of Great Britain, with cou
rage in the field, and wisdom in the cabi
net. In the years 1776 and 1777, he fer
ved as a private in the militia; and con
tinued in '.hat i tuation during the moil
critical periods of the war. His political
career may be traced in the earliest volun
tary afTociations of the citizens, as well as
in the organiie ' legidative bodies ofthego
vernment. He was deputed to represent
the county of Lancaster firft asa member oi
the committee of conference, and after
wards as a member of the genera! afiembly,
When he removed from Lancaster to Weft
moreland, carrying with him the Lme vir
tues, he obtained the fame popularity ; an<
was likewise repeatedly chosen a rcprefen
tative from the latter county : and fine
hi* residence in Fayette, we find him iipor
every occaHon the choice of his neighbour;
as the trustee of their civil rights, or thâ¢
agent in their 'perional t ran factions. IÂ»
appeal s from this review, that wherevei
Mr. Smiley has been most known, he ha ;
i;een most esteemed ; ;nd were it not foi
the prejudices created by his patriotic
conduct during the war, his election vvouk
undpu tedly be unanimous. But, it i;
to be lamented, that there ftili exifti
a ig lome men, a fentimcnt unpropiti
uus to the vVhig of 1776. To such, how.
ever, let it beobferved, that Mr. Smiley's
eondhct arose from a'fenfe of duty, tn-ir
a leve of his country; that he who was an
ardent promoter of the bill for the gradual
abolition of fiavety, could not be destitute
jf humanity ; and that he who with esseS
con.enued for tne abolition of the ""tender
and the payment of the debts incurred by
government, could not be infenlible to the
importance of public credit.

hnn)elf with i'uch propriety, that, while hi;
public ferviees commanded the refpe-a anc.
favor of government, his private conduei
conciliated the arfecticns and frienciihip 01
a. onnci hi;n. As a foloier, he was vird
lant, brave and enterprising : as a citizen.
he was patriotic, upright and liberal. I-ie
Knew how to enforce discipline without se
verity; and to render the operations o!
war compatible with the rights of proper
ty, and the calls of humanity. He conti
nued ill a military tation until the final ac
knowledgment of the independence of A
merica ; and, ever since that period, he ha
been employed in a faithful discharge of the
molt important civil offices, to which the
eheeni and confidence of his'fellow-citiiens
could elevate him. His conduct a., a dele
gate in Congress, under the late confedera
tion, was honorable to hiinfelf and ufeful
to the state ; and we mjy prefurhe that hi
merits have been equally regarded in tilt
leale of federal business; since we find him
at the present time engaged by Congress a;

aiid important trufl of fettling the account

Pettr Muhlenberg.
General Muhlenberg was deligned by
lure for the military fccne. Tho' born hi
Pennsylvania, lie was appointed !>y Virgi
nia to the rank of colonel in the troops of
her line, and afterwards created hrigadier
gefterai in the continental service. Ha
ying served through these gradations with
the highest honor during the war, he re
turned to his native country, by which ha
has been conltantly employed (with equal
reputation) in the offices of civil life ; par
ticularly as vice-prelident of Pennsylvania,
and as a member of Congress, under the
exiiting comtitution.
'Jonathan D Sergeant.
The political principles and conduct of
this gentleman are so well known, and, a
mong the genuine whigs of the union, so
highly approved, that I fiiould think it tin
leceflary, but for the form of my underta-
Btlg, to detain the reader with a recapitu
lation of his public services. His active and
afeful oppofjtion to the British encroach
ments, commenced in the neighbouring
,tate of New-Jersey., of which he is a na
:iv.?. He was then conlidered as an im
portant leader in the patriotic committees
ind conventions, that preceded the difTo
imipn of the dependent connection which
bound An\erica to Europe ; and in the most
critical period of the contest, he was an in
telligent, induftrioiis and firm member of
Congress. Soon after he had chosen his
Cefidence in Pennsylvania, he was appoint
ed attorney-general ; and in.that character
'which foine of the leading political law
yers of the present day were then afraid to
lutori) he acquitted himfelf with fit.-,-lity
towards the government, and with huma
nity towards the unfortunate objedts of
prt>fecutiorÂ» : But the talk was inconceiva
bly ai riuou) on account of the violence of
tile times ; for, on qlieltions of state, the
jiublic officer could no: expedt to discharge
his duty without incurring the hatred and
resentment, not only of delinquent indivi
duals, and their immediate friends, but of
the "whole anti-revolution fadtionâopulent,
powerful, and vindictive. The proof, of
the profeffional abilities of Mr. Sergeant,
are seen in his reputation at the bar, in the
iucc'efs of his and in the affluence
of his fortune. But the lass of- these ad
vantages has never elevated his mind into
i contempt for his fellow-citizens, nor al
tered those temperate habits and unaffect
ed manners, which at once deiignate and a
clorn a true republican.
Andre-"; Gregg.
Mr. Gregg is qualified by an excel'ent e
ducarioii to discharge the duties of politi
cal life ; and has, accordingly, been feledt
ed for that purpose by his fellow-citizens
of the diftridt in which he lives. His prin->
ciples, with respect .to the late contelt,
'.veo? those of a whig; and with refpedt to
the present gove; iment, are those of a re
publican.
Thomas Hartley.
This gentleman's political conduct and
character are lo y. ell known, that it seems
fnperfluoin to remind his fellow-citizens,
that he was an early whig ; an a'dtive offi
cer ; that his talents are refpedtable, his
manners cordial, and that he has uniformly
enjoyed the favor and confidence of his
neighbours.
John IV. Kittera.
Of this gentleman the most favorable
lentiments are entertained, and the belt ex
pecr at:ons are excited. Politically. he was a
whig, and is a republican ;âProJeJiona/ly t 'as
he is Lamed, without pedantry, so he is
la/th/ul to his client without being faife to
his conscience ; a:; J Personally, he is diffi
dent, liberal, and .'incere.
John Barclay.
Mr. Barclay is a refpedtable merchant,
who, without claiming an ostentatious su
periority, is lurpalied by few citi
zens in a knowledge of the principles of A
merican commerce, in talents for bulinefs,
and in an induflrious attention to the du
ties.of public and private life. He was an
uniform and zealous whig. As mayor of
Philadelphia, devoting all the emoluments
of his office to the pui poles of Police, he
maintained an unprecedented degree of or
uer, peace and harmony in the city ; and as
a private gentleman, displaying an unaf
fected disposition for benevolence and hos
pitality ; he enjoys an uncommon portion
of the love, friendship and good wishes of
his acquaintance.
Having thus briefly reviewed the charac
ters of tliofe cand dates, whose fuccels in
volve', in my opinio;', the honor and inter
ell of the slate, and of the union, X leave
the fubjeft. to the consideration of my fel
low-c:tizens, who are certainly capable and
entitled to decide for themselves. They
will, however, permit me to remind them,
that the names which I have presented to
their view, are those Which were familiar
-Â° 'hem, as friends and affqeiates, in the
hour of danger ; as faithful ferjwnts, who
came to their affittance when the timid, the
slavish, and the wealthy fled. Such were
the men, whom you happily entrusted to
contend for the liberties of America; and
iiirely Inch are most able, and must be moll
desirous to cnenfli and protest what they
have laboured to acquire. It is time, then,
to be on \ our guard, to ro'ufe from ycurie
tnargy ; for, behold J the tories of 1776 are
the aristocrats of 1792 ! And every patri
ae usind ought to weigh weil this quefÂ«tion, âwhether those who then oppoHM o"ur
being free, ought no v/ toA>e entrtrted WiCti
the palladium freedom ? I'hey have
faiied, it iÂ» true, in t . :i â¢ ethirts to ;ceep n .

COPV OF a LETTER from Capt. JOHN
ROGERS, to his Excellency HENRY
LEE, Efquirc.
Treaty-Ground, Dijirjfi of Mcrt, Territory South
â¢f Olioj slugujl sib, 1792.
Dear SIR,
WHEN I got intb the Holftein country,
I found I was in time to accompa
9ny g -.crnur UlouiK co tiw tr.'aty in this ditti :
1 pufiied for Knoxviue, the territorial feat of gov
ernment, \a ch place I reached the 4th of July,
*Qd let out fur this the next morning, with-1 he
governor and geneiaj Piclcina, attended by eights
cavalry, railed fur three months duty,for the bet
ter protection of thiÂ» diitridt. A party of fifrv/
intantr/, many families, and other persons, oj:
their way to this country, was fired on by a part)
ol Ind a:js concealed in a cane urake, on the j'jth
JuU, about twenty miles a-head of us, and sis-
Ueu from the fettierrient, which they reached the
<aÂ»ne day ; upon tne Mdiers prefiing forward thev
rui, without doing anv damage : We got into thr
frontiers of ihis difhidi the-next day, and learnt
that one Zeigitrr's Station, at two miles diftattCi
itom \ti, had hr-n taken b) tne lavages. On the
night of the 26th June, a man had been killed in
the ii.int, and a negro girl tomahawked anti
fcolped. i hat day a party of three men went to
take in the body ut the dead man, who lay within
fifty yards of" 4 fence, behind which, the Indians
were still concealed, who fired upon the men, and
wvuodcd them all, they however made their ef
ca r e ro the houses, the Indians purfueu theinclofe,
*ot their guuÂ«, and killed two horses tied near the
houses, and then difappearcd. Mure of the neigh
bours tfflembled in the evening, and carried in the
dead man, who then returned to their respective
homes, being all alarmed for the fafety of the-r
famiiicleaving a: Zeiglst's only the three
wounded .mm, and two or three others belonging
to the place . The Indians returned in the night,
attacked the station, and found that all the peo
ple had got into one houfc, tu the number of twen
tv-one persons, men, women, and children J the
Indians then let fire to the a jacent houses, which
soon communicated the flames to that in whUh
the people were, and quckly reduced them to the
dreadful dilemma of pcrifhing by the flames, or
quitting the house and submitting tiiemfelves to
the tomahawk of a lavage enemyâthey chose the
latter j the cluee wounded meaefcapcd, a woman
with a child in her efcapcd (Mil. Zegler)
\ one Wilson was wounded in the breast upon open
ing the door, he however followtd his wife and
v fix children, until a party of Indians were read;
!to lay hold of them, he then bid them fartwrl,
lired hi* gun at the Indians, and efcapcd between
â¢He burning houfrs j Mrs. Wilson, hfer fix chil
is en, and three ot Zeiglcr'*, were taken off j
2t,ij:lri h fuppoic-d to have perifhe'd in the flame.sj
a ,/ouug mao was omaliawkcd near the houses j
a Vegrc wench killed a fe v miles on their retreat}
'nrfre were bono* of feverai bodies appeared in the
athi'3 5 the that had oeen killed, and the giri
thi" had been r mahawked, but was not dead,

Mi's. Z igh . tv her jla uat 00, with a to
assist riu mauling up h.r enclofurcs, which
h:. I ::n laid open and exposed her crop to the
jflock.
This country is in a deplorable fituationâde
tacK~d from the great body of the unionâthe in
habitants very dii> eriru â almost every part of it a
frontierâfo that ;< a aie Tale hi their beds, and
ilill fewer in the.' fields j the lands in a measure
lie fallow, or arc tilled with the plough in one
hand, in the other the rlrie ! Many fields which
have been tilled in this manner, are now defeited,
and fine growing Ciops left to be destroyed by such
stocks as were unavoidably left about the deferr
ed antations j and ..4moft every day is diftin
gui'heu by savage muiuers, or other depredati
ons.
I have procured an accurate lift of the killed,
wounded, and miffing, since the firft of January
whiÂ«h i enclose for your ipfpedlionâ-which
1 believe will be found to be more than has been I
loft since thtt time, upon all the frontiers of the
union brude (Kentucky inclusive,) Yet it is said !
in the Atlantic iiates, rhat there is peace with the I
Cieekfâpeace, with them, is only another name
for war as to thisdiftridK The whole force of
the union is almolt, lham.-fiilly bent against the
northern tribes, in defence of the Kentucky or
Onio fettlemenrs, which tribes are but a mere
banditti compared to the southern nations that
infect this dilbidt j nor is this country of half the
strength of the Ohio fettlemcnts j )er this country
1i left to sustain the wh;'Je force of the southern
nations, unprote&ed, and almost unnoticed by the
union.âThe humanity of the governor has af
forded what temporary protection was in his pow
er, which can be but small, as almost every part
of this territory is equally a frontier, but not e
qually harrafled, which enables him to fend a few
men 200 miles, from the paltern part ot the terri
tory, to the afiiftance of this uillrellcd country.
Cut I believe tiie day is not far diftarit, w en
the strong arm of the union mult be employed a
gainst the nations south of this 3 for I believe
when they discover the tardiness of the dates in
gettiog an army into the field, after so fhameful a
defeat as that of last November, that they will in
the spring commence a general war againtt the
states, as the partial war now carried on against
this country, will not Jong farisfy them, especial
ly when they draw a conclusion from our conduct
to the northern banditti, that they have nothing .
to fear from the states, and may enrich them
ielves by a general war. There have, from the .
best infoimation that 1 can get, not less than 400 -<
hoifes been taken from this diftridt since the date 1
of the enclosed return. Perhaps it may be thought i
that I reprcfent the fufterings of this country in a i
partial point of view j humanity alone has prompt- 1
ed me to state their fufFerings to you, for I have c
neither relation norihtereft in it-âln Kentuck. e
I have both , yet I fay their situation is far more '
fligfole than this 5 jet they nrs protected, and f
this Is not, only as above described. c
Y The go->ds for the treat) have this day arrived p
fafe j they were fired upon in the Tentiee, sup
posed by a party of Creeks, but no damage dene : c
The treaty, I expedt, will begin to-morrow ; there J
r about 600 Indians upon the ground, raoftly t
ChicÂ«tfawa-j the Spanifli influence was exerted to \
J prevent Clioctiwa from coming in jit in some
measure h>.a the delired efiedV, as only ab -.it no
>1 them aie here ; the nation is, notwitnftanding,
well difpof-d to the Americans j \ have renewed
ay enquiries as so theftrength of the above nati
, 11, to the Cree'ts, and rind my former statement
to )011 f Excellency, to have been accurate and
tnay be relied on, and the use may also be mad* of
people on a crrrainemergency, as in a form
er letter i acquainted you could.
I have appointed to let out tor the Kentockv,
on Saturday nextâl received your letter, will)
lie enclosures., all of which I shall attend to as
muck as in my powerâl expect to be in Virginia
' by the last of Odtober.
[l\ S. The return of persons killed and
â  mounded in, and priloners taken from Mero dif
ridl [territory fourh nf the OhioJ since Januar v
tft. 1792, stands as follows.âFifty-two killed â
13 miffing eleven wounded, one of whom
is iincedeaJ.âThere is positive proof, that moll
o| theie depredations have been committed by the
Creeks, and where the Cherokees have been con
cerned, it has been thro* their influence.J

the bounds of truth be never tranfyrefled, piu
dence will suggest the propriety of moderationâ
because of this right 1 have made some observati
ons, but never intended one of them for the Se
cretary of the Treasuryâcommon fame gives
him the reputation of talents, and hit conuutt,
both as a man and a minister 1 hope are unim
peachableâ 1 view him as a confidential executive

higher tribunalâl have read his reports, but ne
ver as ihzdecreta of a legislative didtator, but as
the chimerical iallies Jf a lively imagination, ex
posed to the pablic for congrefiional, or
mveftigation, and when 1 would applaud him as a
man of Utopian ingenuityâif I could have fup
poled that his reports would have been received as
iht Jiats tf a congielhonal preceptor, very
ent enquiries would have been made.
Let us here pause ! and afkâls Mr. Hamilton
the prefect secretary of the treasury, who diredls
one of the principal springs of government, under
r.he controul of Cungrefs, or is Congress under
hiv controul ? Ha* he received from Congress a
licence either of commiilion, or permifiion to
lalhion any law or laws which his judgment or
caprice may direct ? Is there any thing in the
Jtederal conllitution which authorises such a sur
render, and if there is, does it become sacrilegious
to complain ?
If Mr. Hamilton has acquired such power in
the early period of his political career, can wc
suppose that he will abdicate it when he shall have
entrenched himfelf by the double operation of the
purle and!word ? but if, (and so I am most in
ciined to beiieve) a majority of the lace Congress
nave been so much the votaries of easeâos pica
lureâof intrigue and fpeculanon as to have neg
ledled their representative duties, is it not proper
that the people ihould be cautioned ? and b'Nng
thus warned /hould not prudence induce them to
avoid all those who have either adtively or pas
sively facrificed or neglected the interests and lib
erties of their conftituerits ?
So far am I from condemning the fecritar",
and so unwilling to believe that he ought to be
charged with any legislative fault, that I have
thus explained myfelf, and as t* those to wnom
the observations do applv, I conclude qui capit
\ilt facir."
