Vol. I.
'Ike following is the fubjtance of the obferva
tians,delivered by Air. MliÃ-Ct-R, in
the Hou/e of R.eprefentatives, in the courjt
cf the rebate on the Frontier Bill.
T Originally opposed the reference oi
J this fubjeÂ£t to the secretary ot the
trealury on principles supported by the
conilitution, by the theory ot free go
vernment, and from pra&ical obierva
tion on the progt'eis ot our own,, and
I believe the refalt now before us, '-â¢.ill
fully exemplify every evil predicted.
Let any man examine this bill, and
compare it with the terms of the origi
nal reference âLet n then be aiked.
Whether the fubmiflion to deviie ways
and means to provide for the defence
of the western frontier, authorised the
plans proposed by the trealury depart
ment, 'that we are now giving sanction
to. Did it authorise a perpetual tax
irrepealable by the whole legillature,
â without a breach of faith according tc
received doctrine : At leafl, so far pla
cing the purie-ftrings in the hands oi
the executive, who may refufe an as
sent to the repealâin the power of tht
Senate alio, "and confcquently beyond
the reach of the Representatives of the
people, who alone are deputized by, and
may be recalled by the great mas's ef i'o
ciety, and to wnom the conlhtution
expressly confines the power, of ori
ginating money bills ? Have we in truth
originated this money bill ? Do weevei
originate any money bill ? If a refer
ence, such as made to the Secretary,
was proposed to the Senate, who area
branch of the legillature, nearly oi
equal importance with ourselves, would
it not be held a breach of the constitu
tion ? Wejre they to propose such <s
plan as this to us, would it notbe recei
ved with indignation ? Why so little
jealousy of the executive department,
ieparated byâthe conilitution with ic
much care from us P Of the treasury de
partment too, which is conflicted in
ether countries as poffefling and cxer
ciling the means of corruption ?âit is
in my judgment a direct infraction oi
the letter and lpirit of the conilitution
of the principles of f:ce governmentâ
and I have he.ird no attempt to defend
it, but on the ground of pitiful evafton,
more difhonorableto ourselves and dan
gerous to the public than an open vio
lation, that would roufc their refent
irient, andenfure oppolition.
But did the fubmilfion of a provision
to defend the frontier, authorize a fyl
tem for the encouragement of manufac
tures ? theieby placing the occupations
and productive labour of our citizens
under the direction of government, and
rendering the living of the artifl and
fubfiflence of the farmer, so far equally
dependent on and subservient to the
views of administration ? Did it author
ise an entire provision for the public
debt, part, present, and to come ? Did
it authoiize a plan for lupplying for
mer deficiencies, which it is admitted
do not exist ? Laflly, did it authorize
an extensive increase of the finking
fund, which we are informed is one of
the principal objects ? It would be an
affront to common sense to anlwer one
of these queries in the affirmativeâit
authorized none of them : And yet
these are all its offspring ; these arc the
great objects it produced. It is true
there are in the bill two or three little
clauses that were authorised, and which
relate to the fubmiflion, and which
might well have escaped my attention,
and would probably never attract the
observation of the public, but for the
titleâa bill for the protection of the
frontiers.âBy these clauses 523.000
dollars of the whole monies to be fore
ver raifcd from this perpetual revenue,
are appropriated for this year's cam
paign. After that sum is expended, we
must even the next year look out for
new taxes, and upon the fame princi
ples, as long as the Indian war conti

nues (and by the enlistments it is not
contemplated to be of very short dura
tion) new taxes must be provided, for
the refidueof these taxes are by this bil
appropriated to other purposes, for ever
utter 523.000 dollars are paid. I hi:
appropriation is unalterable even by the
whole legillature, unlels by a breach o
public faith or providing other equa,
revenue. Should every year s Indian
war, and every national disaster exculc
administration for laying a perpetua,
tax, equal to the encrealed annual de
mand, it would be. telling us defeats ai
a very high price; and if adminiftra
tion are paid so well, they may b<
tempted to repeat the tragical leprefent
ation.
But what is the reflection that natu
rally arises from a contemplation o;
this billâthat administration will noi
even permit us to defend the helpleli
women and children of the frontiei
ftom the brutal ferocity of the lavage
foe, but on condition that the represent
atives surrender up for ever the lacrec
trust of the couftitution, and place
the power and under the controul o:
the executive and senate, a perpetua
taxâunless they throw the power ol
regulating the labor and industry o,
their fellow citizens into the hands o:
government, and into a mean depend
ence on administration ; and unlels the)
furnifh a large sum of money, under the
denomination of a finking,fund, for the
purposes of speculation, in order te
raise and fall the price of stocks at plea
sure, or as may suit the views and inter
est of the band of favorites that are in
the secret.
Hard and oppressive conditions Tâ
was this the object of the reference to
the secretary ? it was not the avowed
one, nor could it have been suspected,
from a firnplc proportion to devile
ways and means to defend the frontier.
A mighty fabric has been erected on
this flight foundation âto hurry us inte
the adoption, we have been officially
(I luppofe) informed that the money for
the war department is almost expended
âthat the preparations for the western
expedition must stop unless we pas's the
bill immediatelyâ.ind thus with the
tomahawk suspended over our heads,
we must give up to administration the
dearest interests of the people, and fa
crifice the most sacred rights of the con
ftilution.
If any thing can equal the boldness
of this measure, it is the injustice. I
have long remarked in this house that
the executive or rather the treasury de
partment was really the efficient legijlature
of the ceuntry âso far as relates to there
venue, which is the vital principle of
government âthe claufc of theconftitu
tion confining to the immediate reprc
fentatives of the people in this houie,
the origination of money bills is con
verted into a committeefhip of fanftion,
that never withholds its assent, a con
venient cloak to divert the blame of
odious mealures from the real authors.
We have heard of corrupt majorities in
British parliamentsâl will not fuppofc
an improper motive in any member of
this body, but I am free to fay, that we
appear better train'd than any house of
commons I have yet read of. For if a
minister with them was to attempt to
supply all the ordinaries and extraordi
naries of government by perpetual tax
es, I am persuaded he would risque his
head. The representatives of the Bri
tish nation, the immediate agents of the
people, date not vote away the rights
of their principals and the power of
their fucce'fors. They preserve the
purse-strings in their own hands by lay
ing taxes for the support of government
from year to yearâthey know no per
manent taxes except those pledged for
certain debts, and even those the whole
nation now exclaims against as the mor
tal poison of the constitution, and the
fettkment for the support of the crown
given in exchange for the feudal and
constitutional rights relinquished by
the king.
When the tax law made its firfl ap
uearance from the treasury department,
petitions against it from the great com
nercial capitals of America, conveni
nt to us, were presented. The peti
loners rcprefented the impositions or
commerce as already oppreilive and in
f ~ . . iv'/i j/utiicaia.
.ves seemed to lyinpathize at fir ft with
leie sentiments. I hope it was not in
:nded to cnhance this mcalure as Â«
oon in order to demand some greatei
icriÂ£ice as an equivalents But certain
; when these objections were admittec
obe valid, and a proposal was made
o render the evils temporary, by li
miting the bill to a short period, and in
order that it might be cmmjienfurate
with the original purpole, the Indian
uar. the encouragement of manufac
tures, stability in commercial arrange
ments, a variety of new purpoles toi
:oney, former deficiencies, and a link
ig fund were then vaunted forth as the
bjects of the mealure. These were cer
unly never the objects of the refer
â¢ nee, and (hew, at one view, how in
juitous and dangerous it is to blend
;emporsry objects with permanent regu
lations, and connect necelfary and in
â â lilpenluble pfovifions with measures ol
doubtful, il not unjust, policy. Inde
pendent of the constitutional question
of the right of Congress, why should
ve be compelled to conlider the exten
'ive range and delicate refinement ol
jncouraging manufactures by extensive
duties operating as in direct bounties,
under the prctlurc of providing for an
rndian war ? putting out o-f view the ge
neral and irrefragable principle, that
industry will almolt always lelect the
most beneficial channels for its dreams
to flow in, and that for government to
attempt to divert its courses, as it can
anly be done by obstructing in one part
and opening in another, is not only
impolitic and imprudent, but un
juftifiable and tyrannicalâ yet even
l'uch encouragement, if proper, should
certainly not be permanent. A manu
facture Lhat will not, after a fufficient
[fimulus, support itfelf, ought not to
be encouraged ; when it no longer needs
the aid, it ought to be withdrawn; but
as there is no limitation proposed, as the
law is perpetual, a repeal at any time
would be construed into a breach of
faith, by thole who embarked capitals
an the fuppoled profferred encourage
ment ; but for one moment we should re
collect, that this not only operates un
equally in the fame states, between the
farmer and the mechanic : the staple
Hates are unequally represented in this
government, that we are differently
therefore interested with rcfpetl to ma
nufactures, that these bounties are in
fact paid from the staples of the southern
slates by producing retaliating regula
tions in their only markets abroad, and
railing the price of whut the planters
mud buy at home. In fine, such pre
cipitate measures fecm calculated to
low discontent, in order to reap confu
lion, and out of confufion it is said or
der arises, that is, it gives countenance
to the abufc and desertion of all free
government, and the introduction of
defpotilm in its Head, with respect to
stability in commercial regulations as
neceflary to mercantile calculationsâ
if duties have a certain limit, calcula
tions may as well be made on that limi
tation as on permanency ; but surely
these arguments have been advanced by
the advocates of the bill with one eye
shut, they have not even squinted at the
part of this fame bill which limits the
continuation of the encreafed duties on
three fourths of the articles of impor
tation to a short periodâtheir hearers
are to be compelled to forget all the ar
guments on the fir ft part before they
are allowed to consider the second.
Numb. 64.
As to the other purpefes and former
deficiencies they were never suggested
until some excuse was to be invented ;
and in this cafe it seems also unfortunate
that this very bill, in one of the latter
clauses, slates, that there is an actual
surplus of revenues of 150,000 dollars?
surely in such arguments there is no re
gard to decency preserved, but in eve
ry view to lay permanent taxes, without
appropriating them to fpecified purpo
ses, is unfafe and unconstitutional.
As to a finking fund, it is a pretext
that will not bear inspection.- If it wai
really meant to discharge the
of the debt, why not early prcfent a plan
as an independent object of deliberati
on ? it is certainly of fufficient magni-Â»
tude. Why wait until the Indian war
was on the tapis ? but perpetual taxes
are not necessary for a finking fundi
perpetual taxes were never excused
upon any other principle but thÂ«
providing a certain interest to givÂ®
currency to a fi&itious capitals That
is not the cafe with refpeft to a finking
fund : that should be provided and en
creafed as circumstances will permit,
from year to year ; our successors should
be left as free in this refpeft as we are.
Besides a perpetual tax for a finking
fund is art abiurdity in language, un
lcfs upon the principles of this govern
ment; It is true where we are conflant
}y encreafing our debts, and even wherr
we cannot encreafe them faffc enough,
afluming debts of others, a perpetual
finking fund may be reconciled to the*
faÂ£l ; but that fa&muftalfo prove that
there is really no serious intention oS
our paying the debt, but that it is con
sidered as the great engine necessary to
influence the motion., of government,
and which mufl ever be preserved wherr
once introduced ; that is the real poli
cy, the use that has been made of the!
(inking fund we now have, will evident
ly demonflrate. I have, it is true, no
official documents, but it has been pub
lilhed in the newspapers, and not con
tradicted ; I have before mentioned it
in this house, and it has not been deni
ed : I mufl therefore believe it to be?
true âthat the treasurer of the United
States and other agents for the depart
ment of the trealury, have gone into
narket, and given higher prices for flock,
than individuals purchased atâin thiÂ»
city i2_/~. for 3 per cents when they fold
it to/6 at New-York, âl2/when others*
:ould buy at 10f. Is not this throwing a
way 3/"and 4yinthe pound of the pub
lic money, and betraying the confidence
of the people ? is it not worfe,is it not
deviating so much to sinister purposes ?
It is said that it raises the price on fo
reigners ; the fact is directly the reverfej
it raises the price of foreign property
on ourselves, for they hold perhaps the
greater part of this paper. But on this
principle wc should go on until we fti
muiate the 6 per cents to 30f in the
pound to make it equal to money at 4
per cent, at which rate it is said foreign
ers now lend to us. We certainly ore
their own principles loose more by the
difference between 20f. the ultimatum,
to which we now go, and 30/ Ito
which we ought to go,toraife our flocks
to the price of foreign loans, than we
should loose between 2of. and 15f. or 16f
which is the lowest flocks could proba
bly descend, whilfl we pay the interest
quarterl)\ But it is asked, would go
vernment wish to give lei's than 20f.
The answer is, the money of the people*
ought to be laid out so as to fink thÂ«
greatefl quantity of thedebt. But again,
government had no such scruples when
the debt was principally in the hands
of the original holders ; they bought up
then at 12/ 13\f and 14J or less.and so on.
Why did they not fix then the price at
20f? Why are mere /peculators, (I mean
not to include those who purchase to
hold, for it is their interest to purchase
cheap) dearer to government, than thofc
wl;o havegaincd thefedebts in exchange-foi their "b'C'u or their property? \Vhy
protect those who have pr.rchafec! sof lor
â c/ 6 from the soldier ai d fannei, from
lo.'ing perhap a tem:h of their proats r Why
should gcvernmerft make use of the con
tribution.? of those very injured people
as well as others, to cuc'reafe the advanta
ges of tho'e who have injured them ? Why
l'eleft this particular species of property to
raise its \ alue ? Why 'not raise the price ol
tobacco, rice, and other articles, now so
low ? Have they not been as houeftly
earned ?
In fine, we have opened a small door,
und let us only observe what an host of
evils have enteredâand then we are told,
why do we not prepare a fuMiruteâafter
having compelled us to part with the sub
ject ont ol our hands, and refer it to
apart of the executive ; after it has been
cooped up out of doors, and kept back
until the cravhgs of necessity compel the
admission of part of the proposals : when
-we now wifli to-separate the neceflary and
ufeful from the pernicious parts unjullifia
bly blended and introduced, we are ar
reted by rhe votes of a majority, and eveu
intuited by an abuse of an imputed incapa
city, that if true, would, by degrading the
whole representative body of the people,
involve themselves as w'ell as the minority,
in the ignominy. But surely no two pro
portions can be more readily distinguished
than the increase of revenue for the Indian
war, and this complicated, unauthorized,
unnatural, unconstitutional mixture of,
manufacturing, financial, deficiency, link
ing fund, and Indian war ingredients.
EUROPEAN and ASIATIC NEWS.
LONDON, April 9.
Tuesday evening an express arrived at
the Secretary of State's office, from Robert
Liflon, F.fq. our envoy at the Swedlfh
Court, which broughrthe extraordinary
intelligence that on the 16th of March his
Majesty gave a grand masquerade, to which
all perfoiis of dillintHon were invited ; and
that during the time of their feftivity, a
gentleman of considerable rank fired a
large poflol at the King and lodged five
tings in his groin and the bottom part of
his belly.
.1 he perpetrator of this horrid aÂ£t was
instantly seized ; the account does not fay
whether or not he attempted to escape,
but adds that he refufed to alfigii any rea
son for what he had done.
The express was fenc o;Ta few hours af
ter the event, at which time the King
was alive, but it had been pronounced
impartible for hira to recover.
Information of so wonderful a circum
flance instantly spread over Stockholm, for
there were many hundred present when
the fact was committed. Ail ranks were
in the greatest consternation ; some as
cribing the aflaflination to French politics,
and others to the malcontents of the Diet
at the late proceedings and at the general
conduct and designs of the King ; but from
good authority we can.declare, that nei
ther of these was the cause. The author
of this remarkable event is a native of
Sweden, and it is supposed he was itimu
lated to it by disappointment, having served
long in the army, without being reward
ed sb liberally as he conceived his merits
deserved.
Guftavus the Third,' King of Sweden,
was born in 1746. and succeeded his father
in 1 "90. He poflcfles abilities greatly supe
rior to those of his predecefl'or, and had
much more ambition : his underlfanding
had been cultivated, he had an insinuating
acldref , and a graceful and commanding e
locution. He was at Paris when his father
died, and soon after his arrival at Stock
holm twore to preserve the conftitiition as
eftabliihed in 1772, and not to introduce ab
solute He did every thing to
gain the affection of the nobles ami the peo
ple ; he gave public audiences three times
a week ; and received an injury,
was certain of procuring an'introduction ;
he liltened to the meanest of his fubjefls
with affability, and entered into the minu
ted details that concerned them, bv which
means he made himfelf adored. ' But at
the fame t tme he was fomenting the differ
ences between the States, and, by his emif
ianes sowing discontent among the people,
until finding the bufuiefs ripe, he in one
hour made the whole Senate prisoners, to
tally overturned the mode of government,
rendering himfelf in fatt though not in ap
pearance, one of the molt absolute mo
jjarchs in Europe.
By litters irom Hamburg and Stockholm, we
leant, that die King of Sweden died of his
wound on ihc twenty-ninth of March. The
Jounce Royal has been proclaimed King. Du
ring the m.noritv, the kingdom will be governed
b, the 1/UivC of Sudeimania in the capacity of
Regent.
I he news of the death of the King of Sweden
is confirmed in the most positive manner. This
intelligence has influenced public ciedit, for no
fconer did it reach Hamburgh, but it produced a
life of the exchange with France. It is to be
pie'u.ned that Sweden, in the embariafftnenisof

Nuremberg, March 2. Since the two
' Margraviats oi Anfpach and Baieith were ta
ken pofleffion of by the King ofPruflia, the
sessions of the commifiioners of the circle ol
Franconia, which were held there, have
| been suspended. The deputation to Bam

ders, however, were disregarded by the
commifiioners, and they remain aflembled.
From hence we may hazard an opinion,
that upon certain Subjects, the whole circle
of f ranconia \\ ill be soon be of one way of
thinking. Among these is, the friendly re
ception of the French emigrants and their
attendants, to which Frankfort, in parti
cular, seems wholly averse ; not chuling to
follow the example of certain flnereigns.
who while they pretend to discourage their
arming themselves for actual war, Jo ne
vertheless approve their hoflile designs. Ir
con.equence of Such conduit Franconia i
over run with French emigrants.
P A'l ts, March 4. At one of the late d.'.y
of fefiion Of the National Aflembly of
t ranee, it was proposed by oneof the mem
bers, that no one of their body lhould at
tend either at the club of the Jacobins or
Feuillans during the time of fefiionâano
ther member went still further, and de
manded, that no delegate to that afiembh
lhould appear in any public place whatever
during the hours of fefiionâneither of these
propositions was carried, but set aside b".
the order of the day. The idea, however.
ii adopted,would be beneficial irt its effects.
From the members intermingling with
these violent Societies, a Spirit of difunior
has been gradually generating between the
members of the legislative and executive
powersâThis continually excites uneaft
nefsamong all good cidzens. "What will
become of us (lay they) if the court has one
plan, the Jacobins another, and the Nati
onal Alleinbly, a third." The court party
dannotpoTiblyeiit.vti'n art idea of reficr
iag the old d.-fpotic form of government in
all its extent ; it is equally iinpollible that
the conilitution, fuoi) a-s it is now, lhouid e
ver meet their approbationâit is likewise,
perhaps, impoffibie, that the coniiatti'ion it-
ISlf can long fubiiit, coaftrucied a> it now is
upon the plan of a limited monarchy, and
including in itfelf the principles of demo
cratical government, intermixed as it is with
the unnatural patch-work of royalty. The
Minister wasib changeable in his opinions,
and bandied about by parties, that the minds
of the people were soured against him. The
caule of his dismission from ofhte, as well
as that of M. Gahier de Gerville, may
bj mare particularly attributed to the
popular reientment against him for utter
ing his sentiments too freely against .clubs,
and especially the Jacobin. As to the lalt
mentioned famous afibciation, which seems
to increase in boldness (if not in strength)
in proportion as it receives re-iterated at
tacks from small bodies of well meaning ci
tizens, it is evident that if it be fullered to
proceed as hitherto, it will occafiou a fer
mentation in the kingdom, more fatal to
the canfe of the revolution than ali the holt
of its other enemies put together. The
King's Negative (granted him in the consti
tution) has been the sole caiifs of this ruin
ous faction, who execrate it in every lhape.
Upon a full review of French artairs, the
majority of the nation seems to desire and
infill upon a union of all parties, which it
delayed will put France into a dangerous
situation. In the midst of apparent peace
and tranquility nothing is to be seen here
but preparation for warâthe wheels of go
vernment are clogged at every stepâLiberty
is the universal cry ; but mifunderltanding
each other on the fubjeif (whether volun
tarily or not, we presume not to fay) the
nation, in the mean time is running the
nfque of every lpecies of anarchy. The
Itagnation of impcjls, to which theAlfembly
seems to pay little or no regard, is prepa
ring the kingdom for innumerable difficul
ties and calamitiesâevery month prefent
i-'g a deficiency from 25 to 30 millions ol
livreÂ» in the public expenditures; which il
notjfoon remedied, mull: prove the gulph ol
the immense resources of national property.
1 he substitution of paper for metallic mo
ney is another evil, which gives a Ihock to
the prosperity of France. In fine if there
is not the molt speedy, lincere, and hearty
re-union ol parties (which becomes daily

On Monday kill the gentlemen appointed <c
receive the (ix hundred lubferiprions (at tliiity
dollars each) for eftablifliing a turn-pike load
from Philadelj hia to Lat,culler, met in the (late
house in this city. By eleven o'clock, at night,
two thousand, two hundred and seventy fix fliarcs
were fubrcribed for, and the money paid in, a
mounting to near seventy thousand dollars

are to be considered as r v in part) a company in
corporated for the purposes mentioned, in the acl oj
(ijjimbly. It is said Ihe value of each share is al
ready advanced to one hundred dollars.
During the few days of hot weather we

When played horizontally, the wnter.wa
thrown to the distance of one hundred anc
eighty feet; and, in a perpendicular direc

ty-lix feet. The superiority of this engine
over all others ever used i:i America, f em:
to give it a decided preference to those ir
common use.
An ingenious mechanic in England has in

walks about the room (by means of springs;
and plays upon several musical inltruments

Who would have believed (fays a corres

On Tuefdav arrived here the brig Nan
cy, Capt. Hsuhawav, from Havre de Grace.
1 his veflel left Havre the 21:1 of April, ar.
which time the affairs of France appeared
to be in a prbfperous way. Since the death
of the Emperor affignats had appreciated ;
and tho' it was reported that the neighbor
ing princes held out threats, yet the people
teemed to be united, and the national af
feinbly were under 110 appreheniions with
regard to the complete eftabliihment of
their liberties.
The state-house garden, on Monday lafb,
witnefied a scene of great bustle and confu
lion. To judge from the croud, and the
impatienceof the people to reach the win
dows, a Granger to the cause would have
supposed they were preffinginto give their
votes in a contetted election for Chief Ma
gistrate : But not so were
receiving for the Lancaster turnpike road.
From 11 in the morning, till near 12 at
nigp.t, the fubfeription remained open, and
when closed, 2276 shares were found sub-
Jcribed. Each fubferiber advanced thirty
dollars on his (hare, this multiplied bv the
number of (hares, makes the sum of 68280
dollars, fubferibed and paid in about twelve
hours. 1 his (hews no scarcity of cash.
Six hundred is the number of (hares lim'ted
by law ; a lottery was therefore instituted
to reduce the fr.bfcriptions to the legal
number : the thirty dollars returned to
..hole advanced to be excluded by that lot
tery. [Gen. Adv. ]
The buckle-makers (fays a London

their petitions againltJhoef rings, may thank
themselves for the present objea of their
complaint giving them any ci 1 (lurbance. A
very few years iince a gentleman could not
wear a pair of costly buckles (half the price
of which l;e paid for pattern) a week be
fore lie was t.hruft out of tiie fafhion by the
intrulion ot a new Birmingham delign.
This at length tired out the patience of the
public, as it t'xhauited their pockets upon
the mofi infgmjicar.t article of dress, when they
resolved to repay themselves by adopting a
cheaper article, less intrusive to the eye,
and more easy to the wearer.âThis was 110

Want of afiurance is not the fault of
some writers.âTo employ a country pa
per in openly recommending an abafitiun of
the freedom cf the prrfs, one would imagine,
required a peculiar (lock of eifrontery.
When dragged into the glare of day, and
exposed, the authors of such opinions ought
it lead to be quiet, or, by a public rec ci
tation of their errors, make some atone
ment for thcrime. I nilead of that, how
ever, or inltead of anfwermg any of the di
rect charges made againlt them, they come
or ward, under fictitious liguatures, with
infoient invective and filly insinuations,
without once attempting to defend their
ibfiird idea, that the liberty of the Prrfs ought to
be abridged by government; in direct violation
of the constitution, which left the press per
fectly free, and its real abules punishable
only by the laws of the land. *
A gentleman lately from the interior
parts of the state of Pennsylvania, informs
that the country in general bears the molt
promising appearance of a plentiful harvest.
I'he rye, especially between Lebanon and
Lancaster, is an instance of extraordinary
growth. Its height is so great as to give
tiie oldest apple orchards the appearance
of a low (hrubbery, by entirely concealing
the trunk and lower branches of the tallelt
trees. Some (talks of those rye fields actu
ally measured seven feet nine inches.â

April. Among oMeri a paragraph dated
Hapu, April 3, contains the following in
teresting intelligence :
â  " You pinft have already been informed
of the dreadful event that ha ; occurred in
Sweden. The firft new, of this event wa
brought here by the courier cbfpatched by
Mr. Lifton, the Britilh Ambalfador at
Stockholm. The number of accomplices
arretted amounts nearly to 40. But what
i.i most important, there is a ta kofa revo
lution, which is on the point of breaking
out in the kingdom ; the major part of the
order: of the State have, it is said, already
been gained over. The King had al enated
almost all hi* fubje&s by the manner in
which he had held and conducted the Diet.
In the mean time we are allured that not
the finalleft degree of credit is dne to the
accounts of the pretended tranquility in
which the Diet is terminated. On the con
trary, it is certain there never prevailed a
greater ferment in Sweden.
Some of the persons taken into custody
refolutelv declared that the King had me
rited his fate, and that there were an hun
dred persons to contend for the ho
iiourof givi.ip h.m the mortal blow, for the
welfare of mankind.
This action certainly cannot be juftifird,
but it is, at the fame time, a striking and
dreadful leffbri to fovereigiv, who think to
fanffion tyranny by law, and regard the reft
of men as a vile herd, whom they may dis
pose of at their pleasure.
Accounts from France, till March 28, fay
that the National A'fembly had just receiv
ed information that frefh riots had broke
out in the Department de Contal; infinite

ceded.
Many have condemned the plan which
was adopted on receiving subscriptions, the
fourth day of July last, for (hares in the
Bank of the United States, as they fay the
payment then required of 25 dollars wa?
too trifling a sum, and therefore furnifhed
the greater field for speculation, by encou
raging persons to venture, who were not
men of property, and had no intention ol
' becoming stockholders, but merely sub
scribed for the purpose of felling immediate â¢
ly, without ever thinking of filling up those
(hares.âThe Canal betwen Sufquehanna
and Schuylkill afforded a still wider scope
for speculation as to the numbers, although
Dot as to value, for there no money was re
quired, and one thousand (hares were fub
j- ribcd for by nearly 5.000 perfonsâfc
a lottery could only decide the business.
. The next Canal from Schuylkill to Dela
ware, it was thought, would not befo ea

so ealilv to be spared amongst the middling
class of people for speculative usesâbut

From a review of the various British

no small llir towards the discharge of their

lemn terms, that >"he king his malter, hat
ormed a determined resolution againfl

rhough by special contrails between the
two crowns, they had reciprocally bounc
themselves to alliff, mutually, in suppress
ing an y infurreftions or internal 'broil'
which night take place in either of their
refpeitive poffellioas in that iliand, âBy an
order i(T ue cl from t:ie f.iprcme JuMTA of
the slate, and approved by the Council of
Caflille, the French merchants and mech i
mcs fettled at Cadiz, Madrid, and other
parts of Spain, found themselves reduced
to the absolute necessity of becoming Span
ish subjects ; and to renounce their coun
try in formal, pofitive terms, or immedi
ately close their business, and ill the fliort
space of a month to quit Spain. This was
directly contrary to all the treaties sub
ing between the two nations : For since
that of the Pyrennees up to the Family
Compact, they had conrtantly a righ' tn
fettle, not only in the Sea-Ports, which are
free to all nations, but in all the interior
towns and villages, with permiflion to form
their establishments wherever they pleased;
under the sole obligation to profefs the Ca
tholic religion.
All these infractions and violations on
the part of Spain, had already irritated, ill
a high degree, the people of France, whc
were neiglfbors to that kingdom or in their
sea ports.
The French citizens thus forced to quit
Spain embarked at Cadiz. It was the city
of Marseilles who saw approach the shore
of their country thofc opprefled and injur
ed citizensâwhom, t>e facrifice they had
made of their fortunes and profeffions ren
dered dear to her.âlt was Marseilles, who
by a free contribution, furnifhed to these
generous citizens the means of traversing
the different parts of France, to repair tc
their different departments and towns.
In Autumn lad, three or four (hips be
longing to Marseilles, were wrecked in Â£
storm, on the coast ofCatalonia, in Spain ;
the Captains, a (lifted by the French Con
sul for the diftrift, saved a part, of theit
cargoes and effectsâ but scarcely had the}
jot them to a place of fafety, when the of
ficers of the customs received orders tc
seize themâ the captains and their crew:
were thrown into prison, or rather intc
dungeonsâ In vain did the French Agenl
exclaim against the rights of nations and
hqfpitality violatedâln vain did he demand
jultice âno answer could be obtained.
It was soon after this lart outrage on the
part of Spain, (under the pretence of con
traband traffic on her coasts) when com
plaints were laid before the Municipalit)
of Marseilles by the parties concerned, wit!
inconteftible documents that no fraud conic
possibly have been fufpefted, and by therr
forwarded to the National Afl'eniblyâtha'
the popolace of this city demonstrated theii
horror for, and just resentment against such
proceedings by pulling down the arms o
Caftilie from above the door of the Spanifl
Consul's Hotel.
It is however, a coiifoling reflection, thai
Spain, now better enlightened as to hei
true interests, has expelled the Minister
who fought every means to break entirel)
with France ; and that the Count d'Aran
da will probably repair, in the course of hi'
administration, the injuries done to the
French nation, and by which flie was juftl)
irritated.
PRECEDE NTS.
[From Mr. Paint s Rights of Man"]
SINCE the revolution of America, anc
more so since that of France, the preach
ing up the doctrine of precedents, drawr
from times and circumstances anteccdem
to those events, has been the ffudied prac
tice of the English government. The ge
nerality of those precedents are founded or
principles and opinions, the reverse oJ
what they ought to be, and the greater
diftauce of time they are drawn from, the
more they are to be fufpe&ed. But by as
sociating these precedents with a fuperrti
tious reverence for ancient things, as monks
shew relics and call them holy, the gene
rality of mankind are deceived into the de
(ign. Governments now ast as if thej
were afraid to awaken a single reflection ir
man- I hey are foftly leading him to the
sepulchre of precedents, to deaden his fa
culties and call his attention from the scene
of revolutions. They feel that he is arri
ving ac knowledge fafter th->n they with,
.i id their policy of precedents is the baro
meter of tneir fears. 1 his political popery,
like the ecc'.efiaftical popery of old,has had
its day, and is hafteiiing to its exit. The
ragged relic and the antiquated precedent,
the monk and the monarch, will moulder
together.
Government by precedent, without any
regard to the principle of the precedent,
is one of the vilelt systems that can be set
up. In numerous instances, the prece
dent ought to operate as a warning, and
not as an example, and requires to be (ban
ned instead of imitated ; butinftead of this,
precedents are taken in the lump,- and put
at once for conftiuition and for .aw.
Either the doctrine of precedents is po
licy to keep men in a state of ignorance, or
it is a practical confellion that wisdom de
generates in governments as governments
lncreafe in age, and can only hobble along
b) the flilts and crutches of precedents.
How is it that the lame persons who would
proudly be thought wiser than their prede
cessors, appear at the fame time only as the
Shorts of departed wisdom ? âHow it rantâ  c
lyis antiquity tre'ted! To anfwerfome
pu/pofes it is fjioken of as the times, of
iarknefs and ignorance, and to anfwef
others, it is put for the light of the world.
If the doctrine of precedents is to be fol
lowed, the expences of government need
Tot continue the fame. Whvpay men ex
