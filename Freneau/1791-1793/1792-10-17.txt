Vol. I.
[Extract from the Delaware Gazette, of
September 29.]]
IN the ninth feftion of the e'ghth arti
C'le of the newly adopted Conllitntion
of the state of Delaware, it is decreedâ
" That no clergyman or preacher of the gos
pel, of any denomination, Jhall he capable of
holding any civil office in this state, or of being
a member of either branch of the legislature,
while he continues in the exercise of the pajlo
ral or clerical funSions."
At reading this paragraph, an intelli
*nt mind absolutely bewildered, and
e sentiment oi indignation is 101 l in that
of amazement. Who, in fact, is not asto
nished, that the natural rights of inen, the
arguments of the Abbe Mably, the late
writings of the immortal Thomas Paine,
the example of our filter Hates, and of the
French and British coaftitutions, all de
claiming any odious exclulions of men, 011
account or their lawtnl profeffions, should
not have reached the understandings,
or influenced the opinions of our late coti
vention-tnen ? Some of them, it may be,
who derive very little of their information
from books, and whole habits of reasoning
cannot be funpofed to be very accurate,
when abftrafted from the arrangement and
emoluments of their bulinefs, may possibly
plead ignorance for this political injustice.
But the public will hardly give them credit
for this plea, when it is remembered, that
thefirji p efident, (_Mr. DickinfonJ with
all that manly and persuasive eloquence, of
which he is known to be so great a mailer,
exposed and reprobated the ungenerous
clause, demonstrated its repugnance to rea
son, policy, liberty an 1 justice, and ma'de
unusual, though unavailing exertions to
da't from his own enlightened mind,
some luminous rays into the chaos that
furrouuded him i';ut prejudice, my fel
low citizens, was impervious to argument :
the na'ural rights of an inoffending class
o' men were facrficed to this demon of so
ciety, as Paine justly lliies it ; and religion
was ltiil made to weep over the disgrace of
her ministers."
But you will fay, does not th's pre
judice again ft the clergy, reft upon some
foundation ? It does. But the talent of
comparing everts with their causes, with
out which, an attempt at legiilation is
prefuinption, might have easily overthrown
it. Were not the clergy, in ancient times,
the supporters of dafpotifm ? They were.
But what does this make against the
clergy of Delaware ? Have they, or are
they ever likely to have the fame motives,
temptations, opportunities, or power ? Be
sides, must the soldiers of Delaware be de
prived of the right of fuffrage, because the
armies of despots have overturned, and
are actually attempting the overthrow of
freedom ? Must the mechanics of Delaware
hold no civil office, bceaufe those of B r
mingham lately waged war upon philoso
phy and conscience ? But did not the cler
gy praftife the grofTelt impositions during
the dark ages of the world, to fill their
coffers at the expence of the laity, and raise
their own importance upon the depression
of the people ? They, did 4 but at tht
present cnliglrened period of the world, is
there the flighted probability of such
prepollerous influence ? And should the
former ages of ignorance return, will not
influence be as innocent, when annexed to
all the little information in being, as in the
hands of a fupeiftitious and brutal multi
tude.
The fact is, deep rooted prejudice could
alone have dictated this illiberal exclusion,
for I would not suppose the members of
the convention so grossly ignorant, as not
to know that no parallel can be drawn be
tween the situation of the clergy in ancient
times, and that of the fame oruer of men
in America. Any person acquainted with
history must know, that the power of the
clergy and their subserviency to des
potism arose pr ncipally from the gross
ignorance of the laitv, the prevalence of
iuperftition, the law of celibacy, aud the
right usurped by popes and pr-!cc;s of'

naming exclusively, to ecclesiastical bene
fices. The doctrines of purgatory, in
dulgences and pilgrimages fil'ed the coffers
of the church, and auricular confeffion was
the chief instrument of her power.â
Now let me aflc our late convention
men, if they really apprehend the revival
1 of these doctrines in the Delaware state I
If they did not, why should this odious
stigma be retained ? and if they did, they
must of course have dreaded the return of
the dark ages of Christianity. In which
cafe, instead of guarding against the power
of the clergy, they ought rather to have
countenanced it, as that order of men, in
such a fuppolition, would engross the whole
sum or ufeful information. But prejudice,
like the spider, will hve where there sterns no
thing to live on. The very name of clergy
man is a bugbear to some people, and in
volves the idea of ar:ifice and intrigue.
Diflimulation is judged by many as an
appendage to the profeffion, and men of
narrow and felfilh minds know not how
to give credit for sentiments, which they
never experienced.
I know it has been said, that even
the protestant clergy have sometimes been
the abettors of despotism ; that the body
of E:;ghili bilhops was inimical to Ame
rica ! What follows from this, but that
bodies of men will always be actuated by
their corporate interest, however individn.
a s may fe 1 more generously. Good po
licy therefore, should attract every order
of men to the center of society, which is
the public good, by receiving them into all
the advantages of government.
Biit admitting the despotic intentions
of the Euglifh Church, and indeed of the
Scottish Church also, let us reflect only
from wh.it source they flowed, and the
argument drawn from hence will fall to the
ground. They are religious eflabliflments,
combining a common interest inimical to
unlimited freedom of conscience. This
circumstance fully accounts for their policy,
but can nev r apply to the Clergy in Ame
ricaâBefi.les, in what manner would the
lawyeis of Delaware have treated the
Convention, had their order been exclud
ed from the honors aud emoluments of
government, because the whole bench of
British judges waj opposed to Arneiiwm
liberty ? bccaufe Lord Mansfield, Lough
borough, Thurlow, Dundas, and many
other luminaries of the law were ftrenu
ous advocates for unconditional submission?
If the abetto's of the exclusion, should
attempt to represent it rather as an exemp
tion, than a disgrace, and defend the Con
st it lit ion, as promoting religion, by com
pelling a ftrift attendance in her ministers ;
the answer is, that 110 clause in the consti
tution countenances any such favourable
conftruftion of its intentions, no compen
sation, no privilege, 110 exemption is so
much as hinted at to counterbalance the
ungenerous exception : So that if this
clause be deemed by any as an ast of mercy,
truly may it be said, that the tender mer
cies of some are cruel.
As to the riVht in the convention to
make this exclusion, it must either be de
rived from their delegated povreis, or from
some difqualifying circumstance in the cle
rical character itfelf.
Now,let meafk you, my fellow-citizens,
did they receive this right from you ? Did
you authorize your delegates to deprive
you of the power to chufe a clergyman for
an afTembly-man, or a conflable, in cafe
vou deemed him worthy of these offices ?
Let me ask you, further, had you really!
the power to confer any such right ? For
my part, I never conceived that any in
dividual, or community, pofTeffed the
power of doing an ast of injustice either
by themfilves, or their officers. But you
will fay, tlvs is no ast of injustice ; then
neither would it have been an ast of injus
tice to exclude the lawyers, the physicians,
the farmers, merchants, mechanics, millers,
or schoolmasters: unless, indeed, some
dilqualifying circumstance be inherent in
the clerical character itfelf.
Now what is this circumstance? Can
the wishes of the late convention-men de
fine it ? Is it too much learning or too
little ? the firft circumstance would bear
hard upon the doctors and lawyers, the
lalt upon some others : Is it because their
education difqualifies them for civil em
ployments ? Probably some of the con
vention never heard of X imenes, Rich
lieu, and the Dean of St. Patrick's, who
"were perhaps, the greatelt politicians that
Europe ever produced. Besides an im
proper education is seldom worse than
none at all : Is it because clergymen have
no business to meddle in civil affairs, and
ought to confine themselves entirely to
their fpiriiual duties ? Of this I conceive
they are the bell judges themselves ; and
while they a;e Unprovided for by the pub
lic, with what justice can the public in
terfere with their private conduct, while
innocent. As well might they be ex
cluded from holding worldly property, as
to be incapacitated to frame laws for its
protcftion.
Officers of government, indeed, may
with propriety be confined to certain sta
tions and duties, and they accept of their
offices, under some legal difqualifications,
as curbs to undue influence.
But the clergy are not in the pay of
government, they are not its officers :
They are distinguished from the common
mass of citizeus by mere courtesy only,
and therefore not objedta of any legal ex
clufions. No reason therefore could be al
ledged forthis unmerited insult. It could
proceed only from the absolute authority,
the tel efl noireplaifer, of the convention.
A whole order of men, wliofe interests
bind them as closely to their country as
any class of citizens can be bound ; wbofe
welfare depends upon, and whole hopes for
themselves and their pjfterity are as inti
mately connected with the prosperity of
the state ; because they profefs to preach
the gospel of Christ, are prescribed in a
public and solemn constitution of govern
ment, and held up as unworthy the con
fidence of their countrymen.
My fellow-citizens, does not this de
gradation of the clergy recoil upon religion
itfelf? He that despises you despises me, fays
the divine Author of Christianity. Will
'he people refpeft a man, or trust him in
natters belonging to their salvation, whom
the laws have stigmatised as unworthy to
jbe a cOnstable ? Besides, does not the ob
noxious feftion seem to be levelled at
Christian ministers exclusively ? No clergy
man, or preacher of the gospel shall be capa
ble of holding any civil office in thisflate, &c.
Now in what manner would these words
afFcft a Jewish Rabbi, or a Mahomedan
Dervife ? I conceive, that by this confiitw
tion every preacher of every religious fyflem,
except the Christian, would be eligible to
civil offices in Delaware. Go true it is,
that in every ast of injustice there is a
flrong mixture of ridiculous inconsistency :
for I cannot believe that the constitution
mean; Jerioufly to compliment a Deiftica!,
Jtwifh, or Mahomedan congregation at
the txpence of the ancient religion of the
country.
Such being the fair statement of this
difqualifying clause ; such the ideas which
a great proportion of the community en
tertain concerning it,
The clergy of Delaware are still inclined
to hope that some future day will relieve
them from this ungenerous treatment, and
restore tlicm to those common rights of
cit zenfhip,which they are not confciousof
having forfeited by their past, or pre
sent conduct ; which they mean to merit
by their future efforts to be serviceable ;
and design to attempt recovering, in a
peaceable and constitutional manner. In
the mean time, while they regret that in
justice ha* often been cllablifhed without
law, and sometimes againjl it, they trust
and confide that no other instance will oc
cur in the history of Delaware, in which
it shall be established by law.

to the adminiflraiion oj the federal govern

phia,
" A S to the administration of the fcÂ«
JTX deral government, I have not heard
of more than twofpecits of material objec <
ns to "âone of which refpe&S the
IVeJlern Â» ritory.
" If the population of the frontiers had
been crowded out in close columns, and every
exterior township or tract of land had been
firft filled with inhabitants, before the next
adjacent lands had been fold or permitted
to be fettled, in that cafe the frontier settle
ments would have been supported by an
inherentJlrength, the inroads of the enemy
would have been difficidt and dangeroi/s,
and of course our defence would have been
cafy, cheap and effectual ; whereas permit
ting thin â¢weak settlements to be scattered
along a vnfl frontier, rendered them incapa
ble of defence, whilst at the fame time it
made :he inroads of the enemy cafy, and
in a manner free of danger.
Perhaps too in our firft treaties with
the Indians, we assumed sovereign and dic
tatorial airs, which irritated their feelings,
and held up rights and demands totally
inadiniffible on their part, and which we
could not support on any reafonabls
grounds of claim.
" This source of dilcontent and resent
ment soon fermented intoaÃionond injury,
and deadly snimofities begun to appear
both in the Indians and our frontier peo
ple, and which were every day more and
more inflamed by innumerable insults, deÂ»
predations, muders, and all kinds cf pro
vocation, mutually committed and retali
ated, till the \vhole of our frontier was in
a ftatc of general hostility, and made the
attention of the eeneral government indis
pensably necefTary.
" Whether the war could have been pre
vented by any prudent pacific measures, I
don't pretend to determine ; but admitting
the war to be inevitable the measures adopt
ed for carrying it on, have been thought
by lome people to be not very proper.
" The experience of all Noith-America
invariably proves, that fighting Indians
by regular troops is no likely way to insure
success; 'tis like undertakin ' to kill flies
with a cannon ball, the very wind of which,
will blow them away without hurting or
even touching them.
"I fhouid suppose that ire 1 long in
nured to travelling the woods, who have
by habit and usage acquired flrength and
ha-dinefs fufficient for long marches, and
are acquainted with every easy method of
performing them, and fupportinj, them
selves with provisions and all modes of
accommodation, would be the proper men
to be employed.
" If men of this chara&er could be en
couraged by proper pay, honors and re
wards, to form themselves into voluntary
societies or companies, and could be fur
nifhed with every necefTary accommodation
of arms, cloathing and provisions, from tha
public itorcs,and bepermitted in their own
way to ravage the woods, or penetrate in
to the enemy's country, with design and
zeal to anÂ«oy them in every poflible man
nerâl conceive that five hundred men of
this cast, and thus accoutred and employed,
would take our enemies in their own way,
and would vex and dispirit the Indians,
either in their towns, hunting parties, or
military expeditions, more than ten times
the number formed into a regular army,
at twenty limes the expence which wouiÂ»l
be fufneient in this way.
" It may be obje&cd that this mode of
carrying on war would be a dijgtaceful
imitation of Indian fvoagenefs ; but I an
swer, that however inconliitent with ths
generous feelings of our own people,
skulking parties, bush fighting, premiums
on scalps, &c. &c. may appear, yet I think

E'NlTlNE.Triith neyer deviates into
\IT mitre; r dentation. That an im
pSftorljas affirmed iu name in the National
Gazette of the .loth mil. is fi;!Ticieritly
evinced' by'she following circum(la:ice,ââ -
The writer, who appears under that figna
ttlre, after endeavouring to tenure cer
tain exprefiions <)f the Secretary of the
Treasury, hito'a nrear.uig which, ionilÂ«ued
with ca't !bur,'and in connection with their
context, never could be pi.t upon themâ
proceeds thus, " If these opinions,-seem
to be contradicted in any manner or degree
by ihe other observations of this officer,
â namely, that " the creation of debt (houhl
always be accompanied with the means of
ex'Lir.guiJhment," and " that there should
be a con(tafit effort to reduce the present
and avoid new deb:s as far as may be," it
is molt fairly to be explained by allowing
for a more cautious language latterly pro
duced by the public alarm taken at such doc
trines," fife. Now, it happens, unfortu
nately for this uncandid interpretation,
that thefirft of the above quoted positions
(to wit) that "the creation of debt should
always be accompanied with the means of
txtinguifhmeiit," is contained in the very
fir/! communication, or report, which the
Secretary of ihe Treasury ever made on
the fubjeft of the public debt ; in that
â¢very report which contains the expreffi >ns
tortured into an advocation of the doctrine
that pifbiic debts are "public blessings ; i i
immediate connexion w-.th thc very cxpref-
Jions upbn which that coiiltrudtiou has
been put.
Again : The phrase " critical point,"
quoted from a report of the Secretary of
the Treasury on Manufactures, is m de to
refer to that point at which public debts
cease to be public bleflings ; whereas in
the tfuefe.rife in which the phiafe is used,
it refers really to that point, at which "A
public debt may be fvvelled to such a size,
as that the greater part of it may cease to
be iifeful as capital, serving only to pamper
the difiipation of idle pnd difiolute Indivi
duals, tis that the fnms required to pay the
intcrdt ci it may become vpprejfive & beyond
themeail3 which a government can employ
torjlflenl'.y ivith its tranquility ,'.oraife them ;
â¢is tliat the resources of taxation to face the
debt may hare been (trained too far, to
admit of exten/inn adequate to exigencies which
regard the public fafety ;" (Fee page 25 of
the rep >rt of the Secretary of the Treasu
ry on Manufa&ures). â It is this " critical
point," including a complication of cir
cumftances cf which the Secretary speaks,
and concerning which he observes, that
" where it is cannot be pronounced ; tho'
it is impoffiole to believe that there is not
such a point:" this is a further f;mple of
the difpoiitionto mistake and misrepresent.
âIn fine, the just and obvious conllruftion
of what the Secretary has said is (imply
this while i: cannot be admitted as
a general proportion, that public debis
are public blessings, with which latitude
the dodtrine is sometimes laid down, yet
there may be particular Jiluplion: of a coun
try, in which a poition of a public debt,
funded on right principles, may be advan
tageous ly supplying a deficiency of aSual
capitalâand that such was the situation
of the United States, at the time the quef
t'on conccrning a provision for the public
debt was depending, that the proper
funding of the exuling debt would render
it a public advantageânnd hitherto at lead
the position is verified by experience.
Gloomy predi&ions of the future, it is
true, are thrown out, by fadtious, or hy
pochondriac politicians-; but these beuig
mere predictions, must. be referred for their
fulfilment or tefiilation to Time.
In any event, thedo&rine charged upon
tl'.e Secretary of the Treasury, which hs
emphatically terms '' a doctrine inviting to
prodigality, and Habit to dangerous abtfe,"
is not attributable to any thing he has laid,
ftiil less to any thing he has done. âIt
conduct is allowed to be a test of linceiity,
the course he took in tiie lalt feflion, in re
gard to the war with the Indians, is a
pregnant and energetic proof of his aver
sion to an accumulation of debt. Whatever
niav be the good or ill qualities of that
officer, much flexibility ot character is not
of the numberâHe is not therefore liable
to the suspicion of having disavowed any
principle which he really entertains,becaufe
it may have excited a degree of clamour.

Mr. Fkeneau,
IT is wonderfully strange that interested

by their vain attempts td|fcreen and varnish
over the deformities of that unconstitution
al affair. From time to time we hear it
rep* a ted in conversation with grave faces

hardened aflurance, that the public have
gained a nett profit of a million of dollars.
These filicide advocates ninft surely fuppoli
that there are none out of office, who under
stand the plaine'lufe of figures. It, fir, the
profit 011 the public's (hare (two millions)
is one million, then the whole profit 011 the
Bunk (' 10 millions) mull bejfoc millions: ant!
the Bank charter was v:on\\ five million ,
and confequcntly as the right granted was
public property before the grant, rite govern
ment alienated the property of their conlti
tuents for one fifth of its vaiue; or, under
another view of the matter, gave away a
nelt prifit offour millions chiefly to the great
f aviators. Should the pi biic lands, & other
public property be managed in the fame oe
cenomical way, hcwrich will the public grow ;
meaning by the public, not the people, but the

| their ambaflador here, and all the other
; members of the fame einbafly.
The following is the note communicated,
by the empress of Russia to the French am
baflador redding at her court :
" The disorder and anarchy which have
for some time prevailed in France, to the
prejudice of that authority which foreign
powers were at., jftomed to acknowledge,
and which are manifefted every day more
and more by new excesses, have at length
determined the Imperial court of Rullia to
( suspend the intercourse and correspondence
1 which it formerly held with that kingdom,
until his Molt Christian Majesty (hall be e-
I ftablifhed in all the rights and prerogatives
; afligned to him by human and divine laws.
) Oil these considerations, after having recall
â¢ ed from Paris her miniller plenipotentiary.

t there fume time, her majesty tliinks, thai
â¢ the presence of tiie Sieur Genelt, eltablilh

[ become not only fuperfluous, but evenin
â  tolerable. He is therefore informed, tha'
1 he mult quit her capital in eight days, am
f the slates of Ruflia as soon after as pofiihle.'
: The French refjdent at Conitantinople,
! according to a letter from that city, has de
- clared that an army of more than one huu
: dred thonfand Turks will fhortiy march in
-1 to Hungary. âFor the honor of the kingo!
Poland, i: ought to be known, that he did
. not think of yielding, while a ray of hope
t was left. His army was reduced to little
more than thirty thoufar.d men, without
arms; ammunition, clothes, or provisions,
ami the enemy, with a force of three times
the number, in pofleflion of all the most va
luable ]>art of his kingdomâThe fate of
Poland may be conlidered as one of the tri
umphs of despotic royalty. If this brave
nation seems to have Itruggled in vain, they
have nevertheless de'monlfrated to princcs,
who arrogantly stile themselves the malters
of mankind, that however they may con
temn the rights of nations, there is a wake
fill and independent public, to whole tri
bunal they nnifl submit the reason, if not
the success of their machinations, who. if
they cannot for the moment refill the tor
rent of injiiftice, will inspire such indigna
tion in the human heart, and propagate so
effeftnally the principles of a pure morali
ty, as fhal 1 make their conquests but (Irort
tived, and deliver them down to posterity
with execration and shame.âThe com
mons, who are made answerable for thefe
curity of the person of Louis 16th, are taking
new precaution; to ensure their important
charge. They permit no persons to remain
ivith him but such as are absolutely necef
"ary. They are making a ditch all round
:he building where he is imprisoned ; and
le (ides'the exterior guard, the interior is
ompofed of fifty men, who for the twenty
our hour- they are 011 duty, cannot stir
if the wall, and who are maintained at thH
jdblic charge. Each battalion of the na
: onal guard furnifhw 25 men in rotation,â
To prevent any Hidden surprise, in or near
the capital, a camp, which is to conlift of
40,000 men, is about to be formed under
: he'walls of Paris. Equipage for the camp,
itifl all neceflariexare providing, and 500,000
livres are ordered to be paid from the na
tional tree fury to the executive power to
defray the expence.âA counter-revolu
tion was upon the point of being carried
into execi riojj had not the king been sus
pended and dethroned. The palace of the
Thnillerits was full of papers indicative of
iitCtounter-revolution, which are ordered to
be printed, read in every parifii church in

silient, that the French nation may not be

" Every ftuceffive account from Spain
confirms us more and more in the opinion
that she has yielded to the influence of
French politics. The ariflocratic French
ein grants are no longer looked upon with
an eye of favor in that kingdom, and if
money has been lent by the king to the ex
iled princes of France, it has been more
from charity than affeitlon. Foreign newf
lapers are now read by every one in Spain.
The civil-inquisition court is aboliihed,

As to France, there are divisions and par
ties in Pars, but the kingdom at large
s unanimous; and there is little doubt
nit the gov't Mine lit will soon be chan
ged into a rep ilic ; at least, from all ap
iearance, the lleptre seems to be departing
from t?he Bourlcns. The French have been
uccefsful beyond all expeilation in infect
ing the German armies with the fpirir of
ieierrion. The pennon offered to all de
"erttrs l .'otn tiie Austrian and Pruflian regi
ments has ge.ii. rally conquered their attach
ment to de.potiim, and there is little doubt
ant France may in a short time light the
leagued powers with their own forces.â
The regiment of Wirtemberg, coafifting of
right hundred men, deferred to the French
111 a body ; among the Pruflians desertion is

Poor nobility is on its last legs ; laughed at

for the reports relative to the Marquis : I
fear his fond attachment to the king has
forever ruined I: m with the nation."
A merchant of this city, has received
from his correfjiondent in Charleston (by
the Georgia Pac.cet, arrived here on Mon
day la(t) a letter dated the sth inft. which
mentions that a vefl'el from France, arri
ved at Savannah, brings news to the firit
of Septemberâthat the queen of Francehad bjen murdered; thai the king anil the ,
marquis, de la Fayette w ere milling ; that
5000 of the people of Paris had been put
to death (by what party the correspondent
takes no notice) ; and that the Duke of
Brnnfwick and his army, were within 30 j
miles of Paris.
By comparing dates and weighing cir
cumflances, we are ltrongiy inclined to the
opinion, that this vague account is but an
imperfect narrative of the events of the 10th
of August and the days following.
Supposing the vessel arrivtd at Savannah
to have failed even from Havreâthe sea
port nearest to Paris ;---as the distance be
tween these two places is about 100 miles,
the Paris news brought by this conveyance
would be of the 30th at furtheft.
Our last Paris accounts to be depended
on are to the 20th of Augustâthe Duke of
Brnnfwick was not then known to be far
within the frontier, fiy about soo miles
from Paris. Supposing that in his march
he had met with 110 oppofkion, which is not
very probable, and that he had travelled
towards Paris at the rate of fifteen miles a
day, a good round rate confideririg the in
cumbrance of artillery, &c. it was barely
polfible that he should have proceeded to
within ten leagues of the capital before the
31ft of August.
But we have information (fee Gen. Ad
vertiser Oct. 12) of a vessel bound to Salem
from Havre-de-Grace, with accounts to
the 4th Sept. the captain of which was
spoken with off the Grand Bank, dropt a
word on politics, and yet made no mention
of the above accounts. {Gen. Adv-]
"The superintendent of Indian affairs
(fays a letter from tiie Creek Indian coun

the nation, and an officer of theirs has late

On the 26th of September happened a re
vere frofl in Elizabeth town (Marylaim)
and its vicinity, which totally destroyed all
the tobacco that was in the fields. The
loss is said to be severely felt by the people
in that part of the country.
The General AfTembly of Virginia, now

A letter from a gentleman in Charleston,

happened in the neighbourhood of the Wateree

counts from the frontiers are very alarming :
the different tribes of Indians, hoftileto us, have
been joined by the towns of our former friends,-
the Cherokees, and appear rather wifhful for
war. Many of the frightened inhabitants have
abandoned their homes, and the whole frontier
is, in a manner, defnted. From reprefeutali
ons made by Gen. Pickens and Col. Anderlon
the governor has lent up ample supplies of war
like flores, and ordered a magazine of flour, &c.
to be deposited in Abbeville countv; and the
militia on the frontiers to be muflered and re
viewed, and to hold themselves in readim ls for
immediate service. Bodies of horle are like
wise railing there. Cen. Pickens is but lately
returned from the nation and has no idea, or

h a dangerous (it/ation, being in a lingular cir
:um(lance from other Hate in the union.
11. Resolved, That it is the opinion of this
ociety, that yirpnia has no legal conttitution;
jecaufe the people who ele&cd the convention
n 1776, had no idea ol independence and a per
manent republic : and, therefore, did noi \ ft in
he convention any authorities other than those
)f the oidinary legislature.
111. Resolved, That it is the opinion of
his society, that the constitution under which
ve ast, is lo conftrudted, as to have a tendency
o involve in it a system for perpetrating an arif
ocracy,
IV. Resolved that it is the opinion of this fo
iety, that the ordinance of the convention of
-\ptil 1776, entituled, " A conttitu'ion or form
)f government," like all other a&s of legillation*
s liable to be altered by lubfequent lesiflatures,
joirefling equal power with themlelves. We
herefore think it ncceffary that it fhoujd receive
uch amendments as time and trial have

to that of the ordinary legislature.
V. Resolved, That it is the opinion of this
ociety, that the citizens of this commonwealth
)ught to petition the aiTemblv for a law (upon

JOHN CROPPER, Jim.
061. 16th. 1792. 2a. w.ew.The following is an Extra 61 from an Address to
t!ie Eie&ors of th*f State of New-Jersey, that
appeared in the New-York Journal of the
JGth imlant.
U the new government was infli-
VV luted, an arrangement of the public
debt became : iunory petition* were prc
fentcd to CuHgrefs, pra>ing that some mode might
be adopted to afccrtain the value of cerriiicattSj
it mi 1a r Co other papei money that had been emit
ted.
The representatives from the state of Virginia,
and levera! from the other ftaies, urged the juihcc
of (h? applic?tion ; and the hardihip that origin
al creditors fhouUl oe taxed to redeem a certificate
at 20-". chat chey fold for as 6d. and was liquidat
ed in the courts ot julVice by a scale of deprecia
tif>n in payment of all debts from one individua
to another, and discriminated byCongrefs and the
several states in the (ale of all public property, anc
reji itcd in pajment us any public debt, unlets ai
the current value and rate of exchange. 1 here
fue these genrifmeii proposed a revifal ot thi
several species of paper that constituted the pub
lie debt, and the pofleiTor of a 1 genuine certifi
cates to receive the current value with interefi
and the re.'iduf remain in the public treasury un
til called for by the original creditor* In confe
quence of these arguments, Col. Hamilton, fecre
tarv to the treasury, reported, that as the mun
enlightened citizens now having become pubd'n
creditors, not to pay them would be a breach o
faithâwhereby the idea of discrimination was ex
ploded*
Mr. Boudinot being speaker for the member
from New Jersey, with great perfeveranct urgei
the full pa)ment of all certificates, both principa
and interett, in gold or silver, to the purchasersâ
and quoted the condu6l of parliament ir. the foutl
Tea and Millifippi schemes, being direÂ£ily againi
discrimination ; for though they impriloned th
dire&ors, and confifcared their property, yet tie
never interposed in the transfer of stocks. II
laid the original creditors might have kept thei
certificates : that a revifal of the public oebt wa
?ff)pra6licÂ»ble, because the greatelV part (exeep
the army debt) was in fictitious certificates j am
quotes himfeif as having received large lums ii
that manner.
That notwirhftanding the army had been paii
in paper at zs 6d. in the pound, they were full;
paid j and the other 17s. 6d. was no more than ;
xeafonable profit jurtly due to those who coofid
eJ in public faith. *
In reply to Mr- Boadinot, I beg leave to ob
serve, that so is the force of piejudice when
interest is predominant, that this gentleman di<
not advert to original creditors confiding in publii
faith, if our arms were fuccefsful, or if the man
aCter the dangers he had been exposed to, and re.
tiring from the field to look upon his diftrefle<
wife and the little brood he had left, had beer
steeled a?ai;ift natural attentions j or the farmer
whose fe.ices had been destroyed, and his ftocli
dicninifhed, by public demands, could have le
placed them by the word of hij power, they migh
have kept their certificates. You are sensible
when your accounts were fettled by the commil'
fioners, a certificate was given in your name, ant
none were ilVued in the name of one man tor Â«
deb: due to another j and how Mr. Boudino
came by large fuirs of fictitious f certificates,
refer you to Mr. Scott's speech in Congress, Feb
39,1790.
In Mr. Jackson's reply to Mr. Boudnot, or
the south lea and Miflifippi fchmes, he observed
that they were a company of men who had per
Siiliton from government to go up the Miliilipp
and into the south leas 011 their private a iven
ture j but committing enormities, | governmen
intei poled. He said ourcaufe was different ;wÂ«
were an independent nation, and had a right t<
modify our own debt, and to do justice to thofi
men who took their lives in one hand, their pro
perty, their gun and bayonet in other, anc
implicitly obeyed the order of the commander ii
chief, until our revolution was completed, and al
Europe acknowledged our independenceâand ha<
they proved uuluccefsful, neither life, liberty, no
retribution would have been their lot j and onl
such charaders as, Â§ whose principles were vvel
known to our enemies, ana those who could provi
their attachment to the British gove: nment, wouli
have been the owners of the fruitful foil of New
J.rfey.
Mr. Boudinot farther observed, that publi
opinion was not in favour of original creditors re
cciving any farther compensation j but on thi
contrary, as having been fully paid.
Mr. Moore from Virginia, replied that publi
â¢pinion ought to be regarded in a cafe of thi
magnitude ; and if it wa* fairly taken, nine ou
â¢f ten would be in favour of discrimination j tha
it certainly was their wifli to do justice, and b
understanding the fubjetf, public opinion will ue
termine whether the patriot who had loaned hi
money, the bravery of your militia for seven year
in preventing the enemy from penetrating int
our country, and exposing themselves to be hang
ed upon trees,and the myft cruel and ignominiou
deaths and imurifonment in New-York ; an*
your reputation through an eight years war
while so many of their companions were slain 0
perished in the attempt j and the virtuous farm
crs of New-Jerfev. who persevered from the be
ginning to the end of an arduous and hazardou
war, and never failed to contribute their la(
mouthful of provilion sot public use (when re.
quired) ought to be fatisfied with receiving tJB
infteadof 20/. and paying the other 17/6. due t<
them to speculators and strangers, is for you to de
termine. By equitably apportioning the publii
debt, a blessing would be on our representative:.â
the widows and fatherlefs who had loft all othe
dependence, except this (by the decrees of nature
would have been made to sing for joy ; the furviv
"in? foldier,after seven years carved out of the priii <
of his life, now pining in retirement, nursing hn
fhattcred frame, wou'.a have been able to pay hii
little debts 5 the farmer to compensate for the ad
vance pries of 30 per cent, on all the foreign ai
tides he consumes, arH a duty rÂ»n yzxt of hi'

O SCOTIA, my dear native foil,
Heaven bless your ever honco r 'd ifie !
Wnere freedom once with cap ana wand
o'er a happv land,
And reared her sons of brighter fame,
Stout-hearted, dreading nought but Cname,
[nur'd to war, accompl.fh'd high
In all its artsâbut how to fly :
fn peace eftrang'd to courtly art
Plain, hospitable, kjnd of heart;
Till for a rival nation's gold
Thy people and their monarch dj
She saw, oppreflive, o'er the land,
The taxes, toll*âa tyrant baud,
Led on by legal power, invade
Their rights, whom venal guilt betray'd,
f-!er sons, their wonted fyirit broke,
Submitting tamely to the yoke :
She saw !âbut scarce endur'd the li^ht,
And to Columbia urg'd her flight :
Here following, we, wliere freedom led,
Beheld once more her banners fyread j
Wh le crown'd fuccefsful o'er our foes
Fair future profpe&s brightening rose,
When, fafe, we hop'd beneath her smile
To reap the harvest of our toil j
But in a few unsettled years
The tyrant band again appears,
Invades our rights '-âwhile darkening fact
We fee those profpe&s over cast j
Again, presaging heavier things,
The goddess spreads departing wings
To leave us wretched as before,
And seek some otherâhappier Ihore.
