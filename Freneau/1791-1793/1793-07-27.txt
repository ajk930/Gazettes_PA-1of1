Whence then our independence ? Il
was the offspring of the underrtanding and

We might, it is trurf, alledge theft'pula

avowed it, that it was not th/ opening of
the Scheldt, but the attack upon monarchy
that ~ prompted his interposition. Shall

to circumstances, you mud be convinced
that the reprefcntation is just. Permit me
however, to mention one (ingle f.ift, whicl
I have feletted from many others. Oi
that fame day, that a few of the inhabi

address, approving of your proclamation
wbieh enjoined a ftritt impartiality witl

on the fame day, I fay, an asldicfs o
joyful welcome was presented to the am

how very different was the manner of pre

inference, fir, ou'ht you to draw froir
this circumstance? What a trfeful lelfor
might it not teach you ? Do yon suppose
fir, that the mod refpe&able citizens oi
Philadelphia would have feletted that da)
to address the ambaffaelor of the 1" rencf
republic, had they still retained that love
and efleem for yon which they once glo
ried to exhibit ? Had your proclitmarisr
been as consonant to the withes of the citi

French ambassador, would the circum
(lancet attending each been so inateriallj
different? Had they been equally agree
able to the citizens of the United States
would not your proclamation have beer
more warmly received and generally ce
"petted. ,
It will be permitted me here to observe.
:hat the profecutlon you have ordered t<

Letter from Citizen A. F. Lozeatl. mem
>er ot the National Convention nf Franee,
;o the Editor of the French National
:<azetie,dated 30th April.
Citizen Editor,
I beg you to publish the following ac
:ount of the bravery of of citizen Scorfery :
âCaptain ScortVry, coumanrier of thÂ« pri
/ateer L'Ami des Lois, of Dunkirk, car
rying a tun:.and 40 men, failed the Bth inft.
jn a cruize ; the next day flie carried two
jiizes into Havre, one of theta English,
oaded with hay. grain, and strong beer,
:he other a Dane, loaded withSpanifh wine,
>ound to PrutEa. On the 14th, the feut
nto the fame port a Dutch /hip loid*d
with cheefc and leather, bouud to Fal
mouth : after having manned the three
â¢ forementioned prize*, there remained 'or
board the privateer only jj men, with
whom the brave Seorfery did nothelitate,
on the 20th inft. to attack an English brig,
on board of which there were one hun
dred and Sve soldiers and three officer*,
which, after *n oftinate engagement, be
look and carried into Dieppe.
Citizen Scorfery and his brave compan
ions merit the highest eulogium*. for en
paging a veflel loaded with troops, and
with unequal forceâthey ran great danger,
without expectation of any profit.
The difintereftednefi, patriotism and in
trepidity of tb'efe brave republican*, con
cur equally to render these brave French
men A. f. LozijAV,
Last Saturday failed from the Chefapefcey
bound for New,-York, two French Onps p*
war oi 74 guns each, four frigates, and fix
(loops of war. Tbefe veflels are hourly
looked for in New-York, inoft of which, it
is said, are to {lay on these coasts for Come,
time, â¢ and, with the Ambuftade, to>forni *
line of crujfert off the principal port*.
Late letters from Bourdeaux mention
hat the insurgents Lu France are mostly
juelled and scattered. The armies of tlttÂ»
Chine, the Moselle, and the North \verÂ» '

The day before the Marseilles privateer

loufencd, ftie might fail falter. This had
the defii ed effect.
