NEVoLENCE In the courCe of this revo
lution, it i> however, greatly to be lament
ed, that fume horrid cruellies have been
perpetrated, by lawless and savage mobs,
ami which every friend to true, rational
freedom aud society, mult execrate ; but
which none but ariitocratic and lnonaiclii
al villains will dare to impilteto the French
as a Nation.
With our own eyes, have we teen, and
notu ithftanding the old prejudices, so care
fully inltilled in our minds, in our ta, ir-li
year by our Britifii Mot her-in-Lain, we
were compelled to adnure the uniform de
cency, exemplary good conduct, and bene
volent, gentle manners of the trench, who
were among lis, during, our late struggle
for peace, L i berty, and sAfei y ; and
on the other hand many ot us can liiil re
collect, with indignation, the old brutali
ties, overbearing inlolence, and outrageous
conduct ot the arrogant, impel ions, lurl),
fclfiiji 6'>Hons, while we wereaprovince tc
tiiofe haughty jllanders.
from the faiuplcs ot both nations which
were formerly among u e , we have had a
fair opportunity to judge of each, and I
think truth will juflity us in asserting, that,
from our own observation ol the several
people, cruelty is not the dittinguiftiing cha
racteriitic of the polilhed Nation of France-,
whole people, in general, are asfuperior tc
thole of Britain, as civilized society is tc
a savage life.
One of your late correspondents, Mr.
Russell, would persuade us to meet halj
â way this nation, who ..re now at war with
France ; but, until they h .ve complied
w,th the late treaty of peace, delivered up
to us our frontier polts, from whence the)
derive an immense iur trade, and from
thence aflift the hostile tribes of Indiam
with warlike implements aid fuppjies, toi
the defirurtion of man, of our defencelef
settlers ; and also pay for tl.ofe negroe:
ineir unlit ry nobles ltole from our fouth
ei n brethren, in the late war, and ItriSly
in all things, con.pl) with the treaty, n<
ho nji American will I trust, meet then
half way- They had a right to ibut thcii
N rik American and Wej't India port
agaiult us, and they exercised -hat righi
pre.cy rigoroully. It will not be for thtii
advantage, now they are at war witl
Fra .'i t-,"to keep us any longer out of theft
poi.s j and theretore, doubtlcTs, while w<
are neuter, (as I hope we fit&ll continue
we l-'iall trade terms with them
during this war.
Thole, who are friends to monarch]
anion" us, (of whom are the whole heav;
troopÂ°of aristocrats, the black band of to
ries, tiie filchering gang of fpecnlators, anc
some tew pulpit drummets) pretend to de
plore the fate of the late king of the French
and attempt to blalt, with their venomou:
execration, the \\ hole Gallic Nation. Thai
the unhappy Louis was guilty of Treajon.
, and attempts against the liberties of the
people of France, the National Conven
tion, (by a majority of fix hundred anc
eighty- five, out of seven hundred and
twenty-one) decreed, and from the evi
dence produced against him, I think de
creed jllft 1 y ; but whether the (late of their
nation demanded the immediate punish
ment inflated upon that perjured man, is
what we, at present, cannot properly de
termine : we mult, and ought to wait un
til we can have authentic documents, and
; till! Hate of faÂ£ts, through some other
medium than the corrupt and polluted
channel of a Brit.lh newspaper, before we
(i,otild finally judge of the expediency and
propriety of this measure. Already
however, we fee addrefles to the National
Convention, pouring in, approving of tils
execution of the Uithlefs king ; of whose

refufed his function to the decree of the
National Convention intended to banilh
from 1 tarice the rclraitory priestsâ thofc
pests of the nation, thole arch traitors to
liie civil and religious rights of the people :
He held utreaforable corrcfpondence with
the proscribed ariltocratic tyrantsâand he
remitted money to pay his guards who had
deferred to those tyrants, at Coble tz, in
order to invade their country, and fubjeit
the emancipated nation again to his lawiefs
will.âWhen his palace was forced, a pri

which was produced and Ihewn him, 011

Some country people report the loss of the

I'cenes of horror, but it is time to draw the
veil overfuch sanguinary profpefts. Who
is tie m.n that dares to worlhip despotism,
which is the original cause of all these ex
celfes, or obey the mandates of fanatics who
fublift by the blood of their fellow men !
Lei us repeat to the world what Zoroaster
[aid to the people of the east ;
â¢' Citizens, Love each other as brothers,
forget injuries ; people, fuller the light of

The great legislator who appeared at the
commencement of our vulgar era, said, in
etfect, 110 more to men than that we fiiould
iove God more than ourselves, and men as
uurfelves.
When review ing the pages of history, and
endeavouring to discover the crimes of
-liilofophers, I thank God that amongfuch
ss occur, I do not find that they have ever
Itained the earth with the blood of their
fellow men ; on the contrary, I fee them in
;very age and country persecuted by the
:yranny of kings and the fanatacifm of
;riefts ; and all, like Socrates, when drink
ing the poisoned draught, telling the world
that religion does not conlilt in opinions
which mujt be believed, but in precepts of
morality, which are to be practised; that
the end of every public institution is to se
cure an attachment to country ; to render
the father more dear to the son, the wife
to her hulband, and above all to persuade
men that liberty and equality can alone
conltitute the happiness offociety.
Philadelphia, April 25.
To the Freemen of America,
Fellow Citizens,
'"pHIS is an awful crilis, the prefentpe
riod is pregnant with the mod impor
tant events. Freedom and tyranny, dread
ful as contending elements, are rtruggling
for pre-eminence,and tire ifl'uefeemsdoubt

and horror, we are as yet permitted to so
lace ourselves under our own vine and
our own figtree; but how long tliis indul
gencewil) be granted is not within the
compass of our calculation to detemninff.
France is fighting the cause of mankind,
and the political happinels or niifery oJ the
world depends upon the iflue ; perhaps 1
would not be wrong in aflerting that even
our political exillence is involved i:i hei
fate. Whatfeeurity hjve we that the fame

Great Britain, after having contributed t j
the deftru&ion of her liberty, and after ha

claim to the United States (and many more
improbable things have happened) with the
forces and treasures of conspiring tyra nts,
to whom are we to look up/or affiltance :
America kindled the flame oi liberty in
France, and tho' it should be fmotherec!
for the present, if not txtinguiflied here,
the fparka may again fall upon tyranny,
and tyrants well know this and may take
means to prevent it ; the fume reasons
(hat would juftify an interference in the
government of Poland, and of France, the
ame motives that would induce such in
terference there would operate with equal
effect here. The argument of force can
unly be answered by fore e, and in such a
contest we ihould be found unequal. Thai

the fame right which they had to interfen

France is armed in the cause of mankind
and that her revolution is the pivijt 01
which your liberty turns. I will not take

The capture of the French frigate la Fe

" You would hear by the last packet of
some confiierable failures in London, and
that many more would soon followâyou
will hear of tliem too soon ; we have,
flnce that time, had such a crash among
our country banks, as was never before
experienced or known in any country. â
This has deltoyeit all confidence "whatever
here and in London : So that unless we
received coniiderabU- funis now due to us,
it will not be in our power to fend the
whole of uur orders even to our bejl
friends."
All communications from England agree
that the wanton and impolitic war entered
into by that nation againlt France, is a
war of the king and his couriers aided by
that part of the nation who are influenced
by court favour or terrified by court
threats. The volunteer Iriih are upon
the point of revolt, but whether the Ipiiits
of the Hibernian populace are not too
much broken to attempt any thing great
without flrong external support, is a ques
tion a ihort time will decide.
With the government of Englana
and the landed and monied interest, the
war appears popular ; but the manufactu
ring and commercial interests have expref
fed their disapprobation of it ; a id though
the most violent and forcible means arc
used tofliflc every feiitiinent of revolution
principles, yet the fp'rit of reform, tho'
damped, appears not to be extinct ; and i:
vilible ill fiiapes, which tho' less formida
ble than before, are neverthelef; fufficient
,to excite ahu m and fu.'picion. An invali
-011 oi t'.ie ifl.md is feared ; and to prevent
it, the militia are embodied and line the
coal! oppofue Inince âThe {landing force
is daily augmented ; and many indepen
dent corps of volunteers have been railed :
The fleet at Spithead, Feb. 26th, amoun

neral Sinprefs to man them had taker

Genet as minister from the French repub

will no doubt prompt him to accept it.â
His military talents promise ufefulnefs to
his country in that line. He was a distin
guished officer in our army during the late
war,and he headed the patriots of Holland
in their last attempt to effect a revolution
in that country. He carries with him the

Such a variety of reports, rumours, and
surmises, relative to the affairs of the belli
gerent powers, are retailed in European
prints, that we forbear to take up the rea
ders time or attention, by inferring many !
things of this kind in a paper whose scanty
limits will but barely allow us, as ter doing
proper justice to the affairs of our own
country, to mention in the briefeft manner,
the foreign genuine events of this uncom
monly prolific period.âThat our readers,
however, may not remain uninformed of
the molt recent intelligence from Europe,
in addition to that under our foreign heads,
we briefly sum up what came to hand by
the last arrivals, and in general bears marks
of authenticity. Matters were coming
fact to a crifisin Ireland : the northern vo
lunteers were to afi'emble at Londonderry
on the 16th of March ; in consequence of
which notice, the Britifli commanding offi
cer in ortned them, that if fucll meeting
liiould take place, he would formally de
mand a surrender of their arms. The vo
lunteers however replied, "that they Ihould
meet as usual."âl he Britifli had drafted
away nearly the whole of the regiments
composed of Irilh troops, and putforeign
ers in their place. In the north these io
reign troops were 18,000 llrong, besides
great forces in other parts of the illand,
particularly at Dublin. The Aultrian army
011 entering the Netherlands published a
general pardon to all who had been in arms
againlt them in the Brabantine provinces,
bisimperial niajelty had acknowledged the
eldeit brother ot the late king of France as
regent. Ihe French army under Gen.
Dampierre evacuated Aix la Chapelle on
the 20 of March, without loss, except ol
lour cannon, and the imperial troops en
tered it the following day.âOn the sth
the Aultrians took polleflion of Cleves â
Bolides these two places, the French had
evacuated Mazyck, Roeimoride, Fort St.
Michael, and raised the liege of Maei'rricht
âGen. Dumourier leit Bruli'tls for Liege
on the 12th of March, to repair as much as
poliiiile the defeat a body of the French
troops had l'ultained near Aix la Chapelleâ
i here was every reaibn to believe that the
French \\ ould be able to retain the country
and c.ty of Liege. It was ascertained, that
in railing the liege of Maeftricht, the French
only lolt 20 inen. Dumourier had written
to the Convention that the French would
iooii be mailers of the Rhine. On the 7th

New-York, May 1. In the afternoon,
irefterday captain Wray, of the ship Hol
ier less, arrived in this port, in thirty days
rom Hull, and 2j from the Orkneys, he
jrought no papers, but relates an account
jf a severe engagement between General
Dumourier and the Austrian army, on the
[6th and 18th of March, in which it is laid
Jumourier was beaten, with the lofsof be

The battle commenced 011 the 16th, and
leld the whole day ; on the 17th there was
1 ceflation, and on the 18th tne AuOrians
igain attacked, having received a reinforc
lientof 12,000 cavalry, which decided the
nattle at the close of tne day, in favour of

of the French in the former partot it. The
Captain adds that Dumourier has flill ai'
army of 80,000 men, and has retreatec
further into the Netherlandsâthat the
Se d of battle was between the Meufe anc

To the EDITOR of the NATIONAL
GAZETTE,
T HAVE been searching with indefatiga
ble industry for these many years for an
hone/}and literal Englijlin-art. Notuith
flauding all my labour, till this day I have
not been able tofind such a character, either
in propria fer/ona, or as pourtrayed in his
writings. Thephoenornenon, however, this
age of wonders has at length brought forth,
and with the highest fatistaftion I transmit
you the evidence on which the discovery
rests, aware, that unless supported by the
cieareftand molt polit.ve proof, such a de
parture from the laws of nature would be
disbelieved by many, and be doubted by all.
Extract from Mr. ErfUue's Defence of
Mr. Paine.
After animadi erting on the uniform
condnctof Mr. Paine, and the inconlilten
cy of Mr. Burke, and taking a retrolpec
tive view of the lentiments of Mr. Burke
during the American war, so contradictory
to thole which he now avows, Mr. Erlkine
proceeds : â
" Gentlemenâln that great and cala
mitous conflict, Mr. Burke and Mr. Paine
iought in the fame field of reason together,
but with different fucctfles. Mr. Burke
("poke to a parliament in England, that had
no ears but for founds that flattered its CorÂ«
ruptions. Mr. Paine, on the ocher hand,
[poke to a peopleâreasoned with them,
that they wcrj bound by no fubjeftion to
any sovereignty, further than their own
benefits connetfed them; and by these
powerful arguments prepared the minds
Df the American people for that glorious,
ii'Jt, smMiappy revolution.
" Gentlemenâl have a right to dillin
guilhit by that appellation, btiaufe I aver,
that at this moment, there is as sacred a
regard to property âas inviolable a It. uri.
ty to all the rights of ind.viduaEâlowc r
raxesâfewer grievancesâless to deplore
andmore to admire, in the constitution o
America, than that of any .other coui try
under heaven. I wilh indeed, to
uur own, but I canr.ot even do that, tiif it
(hall be purged of those alufes which, tho'
they obfeure and deform the furface, have
lot as yet (thank Cod) delii oyed the vital
'arts." Lc.eSignum!

1 March 25, 1755. jt 2*wAMERICAN ADVICES.
RICHMOND, April 24.
THERE are chara&ers in this city,
who during the day of peace, were
permitted to snarl and obtrude their im
pertinent observations on the policy an l
politics of this country âEurope is now in
tumultâTyrants and their llaves are in
league to destroy the liberty of mankind.
The public mind is occupied, and muil en
gage in favour of republicanism. Tht
Iriends of liberty mud aid ihe brave an'
noble efforts of our brcthien of France, i!
there are any who adhere to the Britift:
fyftsms an i politics, they will be permit'
ted to retire wi h their effedls to any othei
quarter ; but they will not be permitted tc
emit their venom againll the political ob
jeÂ£is us a people, whose deliruttion will in
volve America in ruin and desolation.
If the government does not interfere
and fay with botdne s, that fuc'n and such
chara&ers mull leave America, the people
will adt with decision, and brftow on form
of them, a livery, Inch as wa- sometime!
given in the years 1775 and 1776.
A letter from a gentleman in Londonderry
dated the 18th Mar.h, 1793.
" It is scarcely pofiible to convey to yoi
an adequate idea of the present state o
Europe. All its kings, all its rriells, an
combined against the new republic o
France, and many hundred thousand o
men are now in arms, to restore kingh
po-ver, and the influence of the church ii
that coun'ry. None of the hostile powert
have entered into this war with greatei
zeal and acrimony than England, the peo
pie whereof, at any rate a Rreat majority
of them, are as keen for exterminating li
berty in France, as they were formerly for
subjugating the thirteen American Colo
nies. The Scotch however are not lo
unanimous upon thisoccaCon as they were
then : a great number in bcotland being
againlt the war As to Ireland, I think I
may fafeiy lay, that two thirds of the peo
ple, in their present discontented state of
mind, are conpletely avcrfe to the exifling
fyllem of Englilh politics. As to the
French themselves if they were unanimous
at home, they might be a match for all
their enemies. Two of their generals,
Dumourier and CuHine, are men of won
derful fortune and ability : But the ques
tionable execution of their king, which has
estranged many moderate men from their
cause, and tht horrible diflentions in Paris,
conducted or excited by the execrablt fac
tion of Roberfpierre and Ma r at, have cauf
ed a doubt, at lealt a fear, that the really
virtuous among them are too few and too
weak to carry their upright intentions into
effeift. In the mean time the government
of Ire'and is carrying a high and strong
hand in conjusdlion with the English mi
ncer. A man dare not speak, nor scarcely
think, for fear of the secret committee of
the lords who have renewed all the arbi
trary proceedings of the Star Chamber.
Every man, or bods of men, who presume
to talk of liberty, or a reform of a corrupt
conftitu.ion in church and state, are pro
secute : and persecuted, fined or confined,
or both, after a very summary trial ; and
the lrifh Volunteers, once the glory and
the boast of theircountr*, are now openly
calumniated and proscribed."
THE attempts of some to persuade us that
the liberty and indep n ,ence of \ merica
is due to thv* king of France, and not to the
French nation, is so great a perversion of
reason and jullice that we ar..* under no ap
prehenlions for its consequences. They
m<iy again and again attempt it ; but we
truit they will a, T ain and as often fail. The
people of Americ.i know the lources from
which the power of the king of France to
afiift them in the day of their dlftrefs was
drawnâthey know it to have been from
the French nation, notwithstanding the
denial of thit position by someâthey
know that it was men of the French nation
who fought and bled for themâand that it
was money raised by the fvveat of French
men's brows which was loaned to them at
so critical a season, as that our present free
dom and independence it. a great meafuie,
if not entirely, depended on it. And (hall
we now be base enough to fay, that be
cause the vehicle through which this aflif
tance was received does not now exilt, the
debt we owe to the brave I and mod Rene
rous nation on car h, ;s cancelledâNoâ
forbid it every principle of justice, of ho
nor, of gratitudeâAmerica (corns it.
If France be conquered, there can be
no doubt but the species of government
iinpofed upon that country will ba arbi
trary monarchy. That form of govern
ment extends itfelf 6f course to the seve
ral poflefiions of such governments in
America, which mud become hostile tc
the free and independent spirit of the in
habitants of the United Statesâ! he re
fult would be warâand âa sim Lr com
bination against America of those ver)
powers, including France, to fay, com<
let lis divide the United States amongll us,
we will have no republican governments. â
Need we (ay more on this head than tc
instance the partition of Poland ?â
Of France indeed we fliouid defervi
such treatment tor our base and inconfif
tent ingratitude.
Those who pretend, in this country,
such extraordinary regret for the down
fall of despotism in France, in the perfor
as the king, and are wishing to excite the
ri-fentment of the United States against
France on that account, have not so much
regard for his m mory, a3 they wish tc
make use of his name to ess ft the views
of a party in the United States, to wh m
they are generally contemptible tools.
They aie speculators in the British funds
as well as probably in those of America,
and want the union of the two countries
(contrary to the interests of America) to
add to the security of thqir property, es
pecially that in B;tain, which perhaps
a French invasion, foolifhly provoked by
the British government, will reduce to a
cypher.
We are warranted in this opinion by
the conduct of certain fuf t icious charac
ters, who fear the reading of an indepen
dent public paper, left they ftioula meet
with any thing therein in favour of re>
publicanifm, so grating to their monarchi
cal feelings. Some of these we know tc
have been speculating in our public debt,
~nd who, per ; ps, not knowing the peoph
of America, (being fu jedts of Britain;
apprehend the government too much in
their power for tlieir fafety. They therefore
want our government to be m-.deled as
ter the British fafhion.â But while out
country can boalt of a Jefferfon, a Madi
son, and a Giles, and many other equally
valuable patriots, the profefTors of mo
narchical principles will be obliged to a
bandon her peaceful shores, and republi
canism will prevail with us and our poste
rity till time (hall cease.
THE days of religious intolerance and
priest craft are gone by ; and to them
have iucceeded a happy era, in which eve
ry man can pay homage to his maker, in
any manner his heart shall dictate to be
right. But let not those who believe in
the efTentia ity of particular forms and
ceremonies, from hence take oceafion to
inveigh against the times, and to date the
decline of piety, virtue, and morality. It
is a mistaken idea that enlightened men are
to be frightened into their duty. Eveiy
rational mind, when it contemplates the
harmony of nature's works, and fees and
feels, the parental care which is (hewn by
the creator over all the works of his hand
mujl, '\l cannot avoid it, mujl feel the emo
tions of lively gratitude and adoration ; and
these are all that religious inllitutions
ought to inculcate. The detufions of an
tiquity vanishing, mankind will fee the
absurdity of falling out by the way, about
modes nf jaith, and forms of -worship ; and
as the principles of universal fraternity ex
tend, the fintiment* of a late liberal
preacher mill obtain celebrity ; " 1 would
not fays he, persecute even the atheist, I
think he has a right to toleration, and,
for my own part, I pity him, for he wants
the consolations which I enjoy.
" I would support the sublime domes
dedicated to the worship of Immanue/, but
I would not destroy a beautiful Pantheon-
I wish to fee riling in the neighbourh >od
of a Christian meeting house, the minaret
of a Turhijh mosque, a Chintft pagoda, a
JewiJb fynagoguc, with a Temple of the
Sun, if any Persian is to be found in this
country to worship the God of his idola
try The sole business of government
is to take care that they do not perfe
cnte one another, for maukind in all ages,
and of all defcript ions are the fame."â
These are (entiments worthy the enligh
tened period of 1793.
Extract of a letter from Edinburgh, da
ted Jan. 25.
" Your remarks on the French p'.-li
tics coincide with my oÂ«'n ideas. The
comparison you draw between the happi
nefsand consequence of an American far
mer, and one in this country, is injeed
striking, and I doubt not, as you fay, that
if the fadts were publilhed and known
here, the emigration would rapidly en
creafc, to such a land of enjoyment. But
my dear friend, to speak lerioufly, to such
a length are things going here that if I had
published such a letter as yours, which in
peaceable times would have doi:e no harm,
the printer and his author, if he could be
found, would be certain in a few days after
to receive an indictment for sedition, and
perhaps fine and imprisonment would fol
low ; but trials are now become frequent,
and a man is scarcely fafe in writing to
his friend. The drinking of toads, even
In intoxication, has been found fufficient
to condemn, where they have any tenden
cy to liberty or reformation."
