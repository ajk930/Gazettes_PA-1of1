A. HAMILTON.
Mr A. G. Fraunces."
" ONE Andrew G. Fraunces. late a clerk
in the treafory department, has been en
deavouring to have it believed. That he is
poffefTed offome faÂ£b, cis a nature to cri
minate the official conduct of the Secretary
of the treafory i an idea to which, for ob
vious reasonÂ«, an exteiilive circulation has
keen given, by a certain description of per
sons. The public may be assured, that the
(aid Fraunces has been regularly and re
peatedly called Ujjon, to declare the
ground* of his fuggeflion, that he has re
peacedly evaded the enquiry, thst he pof
fefles 110 faifs of the nature pretended, and
that he is a defpicabli calumniator."
Remarks #'/ the Foregoing.
The Secretar)*!> intimation, that ihe pub
lications brought forward by Mr Fraunces
have been encouraged by " a certain des
cription of persons," appears to have been
suggested by a spirit cf acrimony. When
the federal government was firft intro
duced, there were two descriptions of
men, who openly avowed the principle?, ol
federal fin and aiiti-fVdtralifm. The fede
ralifts, were those who -claim to the
appellation for being s jainft discrimination,
and becoming purchafsrs of the public
debt; and in julhfication of the Secretary's
official conduct and oath of office, many
have offered to come forward as volun
teers, and mike oath that he never has,
either directly or indirectly, Speculated :
And moreover that the funding fyiVem, be
ing a divine iiiflitution, Mr. Hamilton was
chofeu to receive and promulgate that law,
as Woics did the ten commandments.
Therefore, this defer.ptlon of men cannot
be chargeable with any representation,
that might in any wife calumniate the se
cretary or alienate the public opinion oi
his meritorious Services.
The other description of men are those
called anti-federalifts, who Herein favour
Â«fdi (crimi nation } who deny the divioitj
of the funding Uvv, and declare thewholt
â¢Fit calculated to accmimodate the fore
going description of men ; similar to a pi
tent granted by his royal mjjelty Georg*
the second, to a Mr. Wood, to coin haIJ
pence in Ireland. These halfpence were
worth in the market about a 20tli pari
of their nominal value. Old brass was
made a tender in payment of all debts due
from Mr. Wood and his alT'ciates, but cos
receivable tor duties, in the king's treafHry.
or in payment of a-iy Salary, or debt tÂ» any
officer of government. Nearly similar to
this were final settlements issued and tend
ered in payment of all military services, in
lieu of gold and silver, and afterwards pur
chased up by government and others,
from 2/6 to 1# is the pound, with other
monies : and if Mr. Wood and bis confe
derates, after receiving the full.amount ol
their fictitious mÂ»ney, had purchased their
half pence from 2/6 to I}/ in the pound,
and his royal majefly had approved oi ac
import (to be paid in gold & lilver only) on
aIJ the ivjceflaries of life, tu redeem ihore
half pence, the two cases wo.uld have been
exactly similar, and the people of Ireland
r.yld, as the soldiers of the late army are,
'/y did yownot ketp your nominal half
pence until they became real ones ?
The fears of the Secretary that this
iefcriptian cf men, are pursuing him, is as
natural as the feÂ»ts of Herod, that John
the Baptist, whom he had beheaded, was
come back upon the earth to torment him.
How enviable might have been his feeling!
at this moment; what a quiet and eafj
â¢onfeience would many other opponents of
ii/crimination at this hour have maintain
ed, had they preferred the simple path of
plain justice and common honcfty, in re
fpeft to the army.âBut there is a worm
that dieth not, which amidst their immenli
ty of ill-gotten wealth, will continue to
gnaw the minds of a certain description of
persons, that have thought the labourer

\DDRF.SS from two French Physicians-os
NÂ»w-York to the Citizens of that Ca
pital.
In the prrefent calamitous fifuation of
and after the precautions
â vhich the magiftrati s of this city have ta
ten againlt the contagion there prevailing,
.ve, chief physician and surgeon of the
Trench hospital, have thought it our duty
o publish, monthly, the (late of the said
lofpital. During the month 6f Septem
ler, fix thoufaiul nine hundred md ninety-
Mie persons have applied at the hospital,
which (with the deficiency of .Â»Â»<) makes
>33 sick persons per day. Of these fix rtnly
ire dead. The firft died of 3 peripneu
monia propensity; two others of a con
"umption ; and the three last of the con
equenccs of a dyfeniery. Since the ap
proach of cool weather, we have had fe
deral patients seized with fiuxtt, which
Â«'<? coufider as proceeding from stoppage
if perspiration, and not to be treated with
) simple vegetable regimen.âWe take the
present opportunity to cxprefs our regret
it not having seen a fatisfaftory account of
:he symptoms, nature, and treatment of the
Tialady tha* has raged in the city of Phila
delphia. It has been generally reprefent
rd as tihe yellow fever of the Wejl-lniies.
But that species of fever is not contagious.
On tlie contrary, it is a bilious fever of an
extremely difl'olvent and corrolive nature-
In its beginning, it is a fort of cholera
morbus, and towards its termination, ap
proximates to the malady of Siam. Its
.oÂ«flituting ca-ufe is the depravation of all
he humours of the lower belly, and prin
cipally the bile. In fev-eral bodies that
we have opened, the gall appears of a refi
1011s,pitch,yconfinency.foinetifues in a fluid
[fate, but extremely acrid, and of so fer
mentative a quality, that it would ferment
upon a brick. 111 this state it is so very
:orrofive that it produces a gangpene, pier,
ring and lacsrating the cqats of the intef
tii;e< where it is confined. It aÂ£fs very
much like Itrong poisons, in its effetfs re-
Cembling the poison infufed by the bite of a
riper or rattle shake. This disorder gene
rally proves mortal ; but it is not of an In
fectious nature, ar.d most certainly ought
not to be treated with strong purgatives,
fuel) as mercury.
Others have said, that the malady in
Philadelphia was the irenu'ne putrid fever ;
but of what kind ? For there are many
gradations of the putrid fever, from the
simple putrid xo the plague. Amongthefe
are included the small pox, Pringle's jail
fever, malignant remittents, maiiU-fevers,
and ths> pÂ«itilem':al iever.
It is true, we may suppose that * timple
putrid fever, and chiefly the dysenteric fe
vers, fii. y become thv origin oii spreading
contagion, if the neceftary precautions art
not courageoully t3ken, and the cleanness
and neatness of a city fcrupuloirfly attend
ed to, which is Urifily requifite.âlt is a
fact rtjat every contagions disorder derives
iti origin from some feat of tufto)on ; tht
principles of -jihichxre known, such als ftsg
natiiv waters, which have become putrid
after long, hot, and dry fummfrs ; all pla
ces where the air is unhealthy may be feats
of tnnf'gion, such as hospitals, prisons,
links of neceflary-houfes, fi.iughter houses,
common fewer?, butcher's Halls, burying
grounds, &c. &c.
One should be upon the spot to trace the
origin of the disorder in Philadelphia : but
we are inclined to believe that the preci
pitate abandoning of tht fir ft persons tin!
were taken lick ; the terror that took pof
feflion of the minds of the greater part of
the inhabitants; the custom of interring the
dead bodies in the interior of the city ; or
*11 these causes united, may have contribu
ted to spread a disorder, whose ravages
would have beei far less considerable
among a people of firm minds, and careful
in point of cieanlinefs.
Hofpitstriy received as we have been bj
J benevolent nation, it is otfr bufmefs tC
Ã¼blerve every dung without preftiming tc
rialse uncandid criticisms. Citizens ol
New-York, susses Us to to you
how many canfes of infeftiou eiift in this
city. The public docks being neglected,
there exhales, at low water, an execrable
[cent, (uflicient of itfelfto fprend an infec
tion. A mephitic vapÂ«rr ahfes alft
from your burying grounds, Itill mors fa
tal. Perhaps some religious or political
principle prevents the citizens from iiiter
ring their dead at a diltance frcrnt the
town, and hinders them from refleftijn; on
the great dangers proceeding from thefq
repolitories oi death, so near the habitati
ons oi the living. Nothing obviates their
constant fatal eftefls, but certain favoura
ble circumflancesof seasons, the difpolition
ami temperature of the air, &c. which pre
vent their always occalioning an epidemic
licknefs, the dangers of which you stand
less in tear of than we are willing to think
prudent. But if all yonrfutureprecautions
[honld not prevent calamities, (iinilar to
ihofethat have afflicted your filler city of
Philadelphia, we both think and fay, thai
it is not in the day of battlp that the officer

Extract of a letter from Jamaica, dated
Kingston, All?. 2>. 1793.,
" It is now twenty days since ! was ta
ken and brotight in here : the owners of
the "privateer, have libelled the velfel and
cargo, upon the weak presumption, that
th Â» can prove me to be a French fubjeft,
mirely because I Have been for three or
four months i:i Jeretnie, difpo.'ing of the
property you conligned To me, and which
could riot be eifefted time enough to fend
the proceeds in the veflel till her return to
Jeremie agaiu. This is a very lame pre
tence : for, if their arbitrary laws flioild
make me (who was born and always lived
in America,) a French fubjedt, as they
term it, how can it affect your property ?
I have employed an attorney, an 1 one of
the heft counsel, who are *ery confident
â¢ they will be obliged to pay for the freight
of all the French property they can prove
on board, and also for all the fxpences at-'
teiiding the veflel while in port ; âbut all
they will De obliged to do, will not nearly
co;*â¢ penfate for the heavy fees lam obli
g d to pay tothe lawyers, and for the de
itcurtiou, by the worms, tothe bottom, and
the privatecrfmen, to the fails and rigging
ot the veflel. It will be three weeks be
fore :he trinl will comc on, arid how long
I (hall be detained afterwards is quits un
certain. This is particularly unfortunate
for me, as my business in America, mud
ftfter ill coiifeqnence of this detention. I
have heard, that hardl/a velfel efenpesthat
is'bound from Hifpaiiiola to America ; so
that I tear tliac node of the (hipmeiHs ]
to yon, have got to hand, which
litv.u disappoint you much. 'At this place,
it is very little better than at New-Provi
~<lence, which I dare fay you have heard
enough of. Here,"if they do not condcnin
a Vi il'el for having French property on
board, they turn out the captain, mare, and
all the ham's (except those who join theitr)
then plunder the velfel of every thing the}
can find : Tile prize masters and fillers on
board, neglefl the hull, fails and rigging,
and in eight weeks, the worms will com
pletely ruin the bottom. An American
captain left this port the day before ye(*er
day, who had been detained nine weeks :
The privateerfmen emptied his calks of
ceffee, to find (as they fattl) French papers,
money, &c. and in the search they Wafted
abont 4000 weight of CI {fee : Not finding
any thing to jtiftify their suspicion, the)
jjracionfiy gave him leave to depart, which
li? agreed to do, wthout" bringing suit for
r the detention and inftrlt, which they allu
red him if he attempted, would be attend-
Ed with marc expense than.bis vi-ffel and
would come to. besides the defuti
on. Not hiving a friend here to prosecute
the nr-rter, he was obliged to put up with
tile loss and insult, asd was happy ti get
away 01 any terms. Such glaring intuits
[ cannot think, my fellow citizens v\ iI put
up with, though I lhould be furry to'hear
they were at war, and "hope t here will he
f.itisfaclion obtained in Pome other way.
The captahis bf privateers here, have di
rections to lend in all American.'; wh > are
bound to a French port with provi'*ons.
They w ill hive liberty to fell here at the
prices the inhabitants chtife to give ; hut it
they persevere in going on. and are after
ware's t:iken, the "t-flrl and cargo will be
condemned as'a lawful prize."
The French papers received down to
ihe tweity lixth of Atigufl, make no men
tion of the pretended embargo laid in all
the ports'of France on veflels of the Unit
ed States ; they speak only of a decree puf
fed in the b"ginni:-g of August, which pro

ployed in forelValling all the above irenti

carcity, might occaiion infurreftiops a

you (aid with a decree of warmth, that yot

hence much converfatioH and warm alter

My regard for yon peifonr.lly, as welj a;
being the repreferitjuive of a nation I real

an exact relation of what did happen in
your dispute, if any you have had; ami
that yÂ«H wou'd, in favouring me in my re
qued, mention ihe time, the place, and the
manner ; because opinions lead people
more often adray for want of the know
ledge of particular?. For my part, be as
sured iny regard for yell leads me to sup
pose, that your good sense could not per

I have the honor to be, dear fr, with

Dear Sir,
I SHOULD long (in.ee have exposed the
authors of the f;tlfelu>ods,w hich-a dark and
deep intrigue has laid to my charge, if I
could have ct.ndefcendcd to pat myfelt on
alevtl with those men. whom I toomuch

1c is to Congress rhut I Uiall addrel's my.
felf, through the medium of the execntivt
ot the United States, to aik the fevered
examination of all my oSicial measures.
and of every particular Hep which may bt
fnppofed to have been an attempt upon the
eft a b!i filed authority of the American Re
public ; I shall conceal nothing, lir, irom
this august body : I shall place under the
infpeftion of every member my inftrufti
ons, my correspondence and my conferen
ces with the federal government, my cor
respondence with the French government :
my indructlons to the consuls of the Re
public, and my correspondence with them:
Snd, I hope that the result of the examin
ation of thtfe documents, and the analyse
ot the pretended threat imputed to me, ol
appealing to the people, will be a thorough
conviction, that if 1 have fpeken to youi
government, with the energy of a freeman,
with the eiithuliafm vliich at th'Â« day in
spires and animates every Frenchman re. 1-
ly attached to his country : if I have com
plained officially, and in no ether way oi
the condnft of certain offirert of the tcde
ral government, whose intentions appear
ed to me both deltruftive of liberty, am
favourable to our enemies: if I have de
clared that their tamenel's, that their small
mealures in the common' danger which
menaces tree nations, did not appear to me
t<' be confident with the sent ments of their
fellow citizens, with the true intereds of
their i ountry : if I have exprefl'ed without
disguise, my grief at feeing General Wafli
ington, that celebrated hero of liberty, ac
cefli'ole to men whose schemes cetild only
darken his glory; if by this boldness, 1
have made niyfelf the mark for all the re-
Pentmeiit their utmost perfidy can occasion,
I have never forgotten, what I or e to the
("upreme head of the executive of a great
people, who were the firft to open the ca
reer to freedom, the firft to proclaim the
Rights ot Men, ard whose exiftencc is a;
dear to us, ai ouriis neceff'ary to theai.
I am as jealous of the edeem of the A
mericans as that of any of my fellow <iti
zens, and whatever efforts may be msde to
deprive me ot it, I flatter myfelfwith con
fidence, that I shall wholly preserve it. 1
believe that I shall be always deemed wor
thy in their eyes, of the traternal recep
tion they gave me from Charleston to New-
York ; and I make no doubt, finally, thst
the brave Gen. Moultrie, will never regret
to have been the firft to acknowledge in
me, the e;Â»voy of the French Republic, and
to have heaped on me those kindnefl'es and
obliging attentions j the recollection of
which will benever tffaced from my me
niory.
