FIAID THE news WAS TOO OOOJI TO BE
TRUs!" A refl/ctim p ajfed acrpfs my
mind on being informed of this infolcnte,
â¢vv'iich I >v ill submit to you. If the Briton
among 11s conlider themfelvesas subjects of
Great-Britain, they are certainly not en
titled to the citizemhip of our government
â11 they wilh tu be coulidei ed as Aineri
cans, they ought Co deport themfetves ac

ricaSailsnerfelf underobligations to Franee
and that .i;e feel, an intere.l in her cause ;
is it not then degrading to the iaft degree to
our citizens to bear with fucli language ?
Hou- long will the temper of Americans
brook such infoiencc? The name of a Briton
is discord to the ear of many of the friend
of t le late revolution ; they have not for
gotten tiie barbarities which marked the
pr ess of tile Britiih "arm , tile devsftu
ti > 1 of th-ir armies, which, lice the lu
cu Is of Egypt, spread run w lerever they
a.pa uacired ; it wnttld be pruitent ttu'fe
fora for Britons and their friends to sup
prels their calumnies and rejoicings, left A
mericans, with the generolity, may aifopof
fefs the resentment of the lion when roused.
It appears that the Engli nmen who have e
migi atedto thiscou.)try,conlider
as a superior order of bei 15s, a fpeiies o
nobility, altho' in their own country they
gazed at nobility at an hu nble dill 1 ice. As
they have acquired a consequence, and in
deed a fortune here, which they never
could have arrived at at home, thev
ought to befatislied .vith 'lav: lg tlie_/?atim
of men and condition of equality without
afpiringto pre-eminence, which their ta
leiitj. capacities, or indeed any qualificatioi
whatever, dius not entitle them to.
Should any further info'encies escape froir
the person to whom I have alluded, I Ihall

r. An a according to the de
finition of lo 111 e high-flying ariiloci. ts, is
ao independent citizen, who is totally de
tached from every lucrative expectation,
cither by oi'rici. 1 appointments, bank divi
dend, or the rife and > all of funded Hock.
A man who attempts to support the Fede
ral Constitution upon its original Republi
can principles, and dares censure the ad
nuniltration of government, when it ap
parently tends to eUabiiih the interest of
individuals, to the injury of the merchant,
trarlefmen and mannfaflurer ; when a
man of this character prefuines to arraign
the conduct of public men, and i.iveftigate
public measures, the arillocr ts, \Mth
mouths wide open, begin to cry out a/.ti
federalijm ; and a hue and cry immedi
ately itfues to blad his reputat on.
A Frderali/t, according to the definition
of the fame people, is a man who has.quit
ted every kind of business but /peculation-,
whose who e dependence in life, is 011 the
intereJt wh eh the public funds neat him
whose political creed is, to believe in the
infallibility of the financier, and to pro
mote every measure, however ruinous to
the community, provided it supports, or
does not injure the financeermg lyllem â
To complete his character, he mil be an
high advocate for the payment of Impoji
and Ey.cije. He mult he a violent oppofer
of the French nation ; more particularly it
he formerly made, his fortune by them' â

ifl The murder of our defencelefs far

so ne friendly Indian, who wishes to pre

ivan! of fiji-m in our defence â¢. for the man
who fir ' takes Ihe alarm (underft nding no
particular agreement of tiie community,
touching such a contingency) runs away
to his relations as fall as poflible, and everv
neighbour catching the panic,thinks him
felf to be the only pcrfon left to ligh", and,
nitnrally enough, ge's off the fame route
as speedily as e can, till luckily for a'l,
the meeting of roads on the general retreat
the breaking o wag ;ons, the Itraying of
horses, an 1 fometi nes halting to dn'nk
whisky.puts a flop to the hu ly b rly scene,
an I brings them to a reeolledion that they
are in fu.hcient fa ce to rally. Thus they
return to explore tht ir plun Icred country,
and to buy the unfortunate scalped heads
in the fag end of the retreat, which their
precipiiate flight ha 1 occa toned ; wliiltl a
rendezvous at certain llations, to hive
been previously appointed for such contin
gency, would 11 t only have prevented the
approach of an enemy very far inferior in
Hum ers, to the effectual salvation of their
neighbours lives and their own property ;
but would lijve induced the Indi ns to re
linquish pretensions To a war fraught with
too much diffi ulty for their fuccels and
an expedition into a country at all times
too well guar led for them to penetrate,
while the whites, in perse "t ordei and well
arranged fyltem, remain firm on ftrongand
open ground well secured in their rear by
successive grades of their fellow citizens, at
all tim s ready for their reinforcement and
relief with men and prov fions.
Having thus offered a few hints with
refp fl to some general cau esof failure, I
wili endeavour to form the outlines of a
rem â  'y which present- itfelf to m-y imagi
nation, thedefedts whereof may iloubtlcfs
be greatly improved by others.
1 propo e to eltablilh, by association, a
fyttem of common defence and con ingent
warfare, founded on the cor.ftitutionai
rights of th people, calculated for irame
diate cont'ngencies againll infurreclion or
invasion, which on a< count of dillance or
other causes may intervene, between the
firlt rupture and the aid of the federal go
ve. n l ent, n casts where the law may be
silent, or beyond the governor's authority
to remc ly. A"d together with thefeob
fervationsas a part, 1 will firll premise as
a b fii for the foun latio . of proper arti
cl *s, a few leading and incontrovertible
princip es and maxims of government.
ill. Government is in ft it uted for the
t tlit ol social in'.ercourfe, and the fecu
r v ot social righ s ; and it cannot conlli
tutionally depart from thole objects : for
every d parture has a tenden y to annihi
late the whole compa6l between the go
vernment and society.
2 1. Alleg ance and prote6tion are reci
procal in their nature ; and :he one may ol
right be refufed when the other is with
drawn.
3f. The people have a right to beat
arms for the defence of the state.
4'h. The people have a right to affem
ble together to consult for the common
good
sth. A frequent recurrence to funda
mental principles, is absolutely necessary
' to preserve the bkffirigs of liberty.
6th. The declaration of rights i: a part
of the conllitution of the state, and ought
never to be violated on any pretence what
ever.
7til It is the constitutional duty of the
United Sates, and of their citizens, t
establish julliee ; to insure domellic tran
quility ; to promote the general welfare;
and to secure the bl (lings of liberty to
themfclves and their pollerity.
Bth. " Civil liberty is that which is de
fined to be natural liberty, so far reftraincd
by human laws (and no farther) as is ne
ttffary and expedient for the general a â 
vantag of the public.
gth. " The ri wfht of personal security
conli'ls in a person's legal an ' uninterrupt
ed enjoyme.it of his life, his limbs, his bo
dy, his health, and his reputation."
loth. " Whenever the conllitution of a
(lite in any man, or body of rafn, a
power of dellroyini, at pleasure, th- lives
or menbers of citizen , such conllitution
is in the hitched degree tyrannical ; and I
apprehend the drift of his principle re
fpeits tlie ways and means, and bears re
fvrence, like man ot er written ellablilh
ments, to the sis h pri iciple herein.
It'll The cxpence of government falls
finally on the people; and therefore, in
exigencies, where the public p ovifion ii
ina K qua- e to the ca'ls ol imm diate pro
tection. and the supplies or services art
born Jide furnifheri or performed by indi
viduals, or a part of he people voluntarily,
and app ied to that particular us âSuch
claim or claims are equitable againlt the
community (though not especially autho
rised by law) an I when so rilked on f lit
and up ight mot ves, they ought o be
made good by ail of Congress, as in the
Carolin< pre edent of 1776
I2th. oelf defence is the fitft principle
in natural or social law, is the piimarv ob
j d of political co>.ltitutions, and the in
herent rights of every people.
13th. The United States have express
lv llipu'ated through the a ceptance ol
the fovereigntv offered by the cession law
that they " SHA LL proreft the TNHA
BlTANTSagai.fi ENEMIES."
On these grounds I take the liberty ol
fubmitti g to y ur coniider:;tion anc
adoption t e following or fo.ne such fornr
and matter f r a geneial affoc ation, tc
be dillributed through our refpedbve coun
tries.
" Wherefore, we the fubferibers, con
templat ng the above recited principles
an maxims, to be founded in natura
and civil rights, and regretting the remote
ness of our situation f om t e feat of that
government, which we are always ready
and willing to support in ts conlliiutiona
privilege and due adminirtrdtion of jus
tice, have thought proper to associate to
ge her, for s he common good, and t â  bine
ou selves firmly 10 each other, for th<
common defence of our country, and fu
ure fylletn of our contingent warfare or
tilt frontiers
I We wi 1 pay all due obedienc* to
the conllitution of the United States
the laws and ordinances thereon founded,
II We wdl not in ourselves tranfgreA
on the lands, uijullly take the lives, the
property, or trespass on the lands anc
rivileges of any Indian, or other nation
adjacent to this territory, and will as much
as in our power prevent such in others.
111 We will hold society and cor
refp ndence with one committee in each
county to be composed of such of otn
members, as may be e eiled by us, fr >m
the 'efpedlive neighbourhoods, touch
ing the lafetv and proirdlion of our fron

will <-le& one member from each commit

any new rules or regulations, when a ma

IV. Each committee and convention

their own officers.
V. We will not interme Idle with levy
ing war, except in such cafe as where con
tingencies may leave us dellitute of im
mediate federal protedl ion ; and this only
in exigencies, making offence to defend
only.
VI. We will in each county, refpec
tive'y, arrange our places of rendezvous,
in cafe of dangerous alarmâpreferring
always the frontier pod where that dial:
not be more than five miles farther from
us than the interior oneâand when so
convened, will obey the eMeil officer at
such poll, or the person elected, if no of
ficer should be pit lent.
VII. When so convened, the frontier
polls shall remain on dutv, for the gene

VIII. We will aid, affill, and pro ett
osrfr.ends the Chickafaws, as f r as pof
lible, lo long as they continue such to the
Uni ed States.
IX Having now evinced our deter
mination to be obedient to the laws o(
the American Union, and to observe the
law of nations 'n al things WE do f.â
lemnly and pofitivelv declare, that we wi I
not on any account whatever, fotb ar far

the insidious arts and deceptions ra&iced
by Spanish and . ther traders, and ou.laws
againll the good people of this territory,
and the icit reds of the United State..â
And we do further declare, th 11 whene
ver any oven acts or misfeaiance (hall hap

of shall be had againll any Indian, any
trader, outlaw, or other person, we will
as so 11 as poilib'e seek fans action there
for, in such minner and form as our ref
peftive c imrni tees or general convenlion
(halldireCl And further, that as far as
t e laws permit, or as far s possible in
time of war, or whe e the Jaws and fede
ral ppjteCfion are silent, we will by every
means in our power, aid, comfort, and pro
test the poor and indullrious c tizens of

America (coming to u well recommend
ed as such) in driving out the Indi ns,

unto them the said depredatory Indians
or any of them ; to the end, thai the
countries so conquered, may become also

political use and be efit ; and the incep

lawful citizens, through fair and equitab e
means, relyi g on the jtiftice of the Uni

And to the end that this fyflem may be
come uniform, orderly, and efF cl ve, to
the great uft and political bene t of the
fa id United Stars, and their citizens,
paiticularly those in all places, remotely
situated as we a e) we recommend our

In consideration and confirmation
whereof, we do pledge ourselves mutu

pe&ive names.
Many other matters occur to which will
