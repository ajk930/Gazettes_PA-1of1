Numb. 49 of Vol. ll.] WEDNESDAY, April 17, 1793.
Mr FreneAu,
THE two enclosed pieces appeared in the
Hartford American Mercury of April ift.
They seem to have been calculated more
particularly for the meridian of Connecti
cut, bntuiayalfo be very acceptable to a
number of readers in " the latitude oj
Philadelphia." A. B.
AS the origin of all power is in the people,
a government recogniziug that prin
ciple, audfecuring the rights of represen
tation and election, is said to be a fret
government. The constitution of the
United States, and of the individual States
of America, fall within this description ;
for the people in whom the source of pow
er resides, impart the firit imptilfe and
moving force to the political machine, b)
ele&io iâThis right forms the basis of out
freedomâit is the check to the en
croachments of the magistrates, and thai
degree of influence which they might
othefwife obtain over the fubjefts of theii
authority. The history of past ages, as well
as the known principles of human nature,
afford the fulleft evidence of the tendencj
of all government toward absolute domi
nionâ Therefore, in its conllitution and
formation, that it be ballanced, checked
and secured, againit this natural tendencj
as far as the caie will admit, is not of it
felf enough ; there is a duty continually tc
be performed by the people ; they are tc
w.itch and employ the checks left in their
hands. The continuation of their liber
ty does not so inuch depend upon the ex
igence of the right of election, as upon a
vigilant and careful exercise of it.â The)
are the proprietors of government, and
the ruler, the person who isentrufted with
the management of the estate. If the
owners neglect their proprietary interest,
the manager may easily run off with the
profit, leaving them to {hare in nothing but
the expente. A progreflion of ftnull and
imperceptible encroachments may incourfe
of time grow into fyltem and acquire the
force of precedent. From the fame cause,
the sentiments, manners and habits of a
country, may fuffer a flow revolution, and
elections retain nothing of their original,
but the name.
These observations, though they contain
no new or uncommon sentiments to re
commend them, are, from the nature of
the subject, worthy of some attention, and
may lead us to reflect, that the liberty we
enjoy is an inheritance we are bound to
transmit to posterity unimpaired. If the
use or abuse of the right of election is the
medium through which it may be either
preserved or loit, the con:lu(ion iÂ»obvious,
that an attentive exercise of this right is an
indifpenlible duty incumbent on every
Freeman. The c hies magistrates in Con
ne&ictit are often elected by less than one
twentieth part of the legal voters âBut a
small part of the Freemen assemble, and
but a small portion of that part attend
when the mod important branch of the
bulinefs is tranfa ; tinif âthe Tools and Con
nectioKs of thole who seek for office rc
left to execute their deligns unmolelLd
When such inattentioi prevails, it is nei
ther strange or unaccountable, that men
some times gain an election, and afterwards
hold their plat e againll the choice of a ma
jority of the people.
It may be urged tiiat the Freemen can
not have personal knowledge of every man
held up to view, as meriting their Suffra
ges throughout a whole State ; and mull
either be guided by the opinion of others,
or must many times negleit to act.
But if it be a buliuefs of such moment,
every Elector ought to i.iform himfelf, ami
always t.) give his fuffrage according to the
bed information he can obtain. Men who
have gained important offices, whether de
serving or undeserving, are, from their con
dition and lituation, always able to (ectire
to themselves friends.
The longer such office has been in tht
poileffion of one man. or one family, the
more numerous will be his adherents rea
dy to cover his faults, and exhibit only the
faireft part of his charafler. Hence ari
ses aqneflion worthy the attention and ex
amination of every Free ElectorâWhe
ther public difcullion of the qualifications
and merits of candidates for office, be not
necefiary for the formation of a right judg
ment on that fubjeftâMen who occupy
elevated stations in life, are surrounded
with sycophants and flatterers, ready on
every occasion to pimp, cabal, vaA intrigue
for their patron. Nothing affords To great

of every one, opens the sources of intelli
gence, and excites men to develope the
truth. He who fears to be tried by this
test, ought never to come forth as a candi
date for office.
Another thing deserving of notice in the
exercise of the right of election, is, that
the highelt offices be not continued too long
in one family or perjon,
In Connecticut the compensations given
for public services are in ijo cases so great
as to produce a dangerous accumulation
of wealth in the hands of those who re
ceive them, but it is very oovious, that the
long continuance of dignified and impor
tant offices in the fame -family, begets an
influence more dangerous to a republican
government than that which is derived
from wealth. Anltocratic fentimencs, and
aristocratic manners are here generated,
nursed and matured. A man born and
educated with exalted ideas of his own
greatness and that of his anceftofs, will
neverconiider his fell >w-me:i as his equals
or as partaking of the f ime riphtsâlnve'l
him with the poweri of m igltVracy, and
all subordinate offices of trull and einoln
mcnt, wi.hin his reach. wilibefeized upon
for his own family and connections, to the
exclusion of those who are much better
qualified. By such means he will form an
atmosphere of influence tending directly to
sap the foundation of free government
Tne firft article of the creed of a repub
lican, is that all men are equal, and are
distinguished only by their ability and their
mprit.
But when power has been fuffered to
flow in the fame channel until it has pro
duced to itfelfa bulwark against the hands
who gave it, these principles are revers
edâ" It then becomes the Electors to be
fenlible of their just rights, in order, that
by understanding in the firft place what as
men they owe to themselves, they may in
the second make their rulers know, and i#
necessary feel, what they, as servants of the
people, owe to them."
ALGERNON SIDNEY.
In a preceding paper I fnggefted a few
thoughts on the importance of elections,
and the dangerous consequence of neg
ligence in the elective body ; in pu.-fuing
the fnbjett we fliall naturally notice tne
operation, influence, and effect of par
ties.
TT will be found in all free governments,
tvhere full liberty of thought & aition is
allowed, that the public sentiment will be
divided on many questions refpefting the
principles of the government, the admin
istration, or some other circumstance con
nected with the general police, from
whence parties arc produced. At the
commencement of the late war, some per
sons of haughty and imperious minds be
came leaders in the revolution, not from
an attachment to republican principles,
but from a regard to til? honors expected
to be fliared under tiie new government.
From this source originated two parties
in Connecticut, the one contending for the
good of the w hole, proceeded on democra
tic ground, and endeavoured by their prac
tice to verify their prcfeffions in the cause
of libertyâthe other feemcd tÂ» aim at the
good o(the few. and the aggrandizement of
particular families, clamoured for more
'vergy and a higher tone to the adminif
trat c inveighed ajainft the imbecility,
timidity ir>d dependance of the maÂ»,if
rrates, and . idiculcd every republican ar
gument opposed to their yfttm, T' e cn

Though this was not the ast f the Free
men at large, but the refrlt of fliilful ma
nagement in the Legislature, yet it was
conlidered by the fuccefsfi.l partizans as a
fubjeft of triumph, and from thk rime
their attempts to influent e fucietding elec
tions, became more direst. open and noto
rious. The ribaldry of Bil:ingfgate was
letloofe upon their opponents fioma mer
cenary grai:pe of grutftreet Jcriblers.
through the medium of a projlituted pre/s.
Low ridicule, with them was forcible ar
gument. and the application of unmeaning
nicknames, such as Bubo, Wnglog, Wro>;n
head, Wimble, an& Copper, conclulive evi
dence. Inihort, men of the most elia
blifhed reputationfor integrity and worth,
who appeared on the other ficie of the
question, were traduced, vilified, andfenr
riloufly abused ; and if. I may use the lan
guage of the gamester, the design was to
jhujfle and cut the pack until all the hoi.on
should be dealt into their >uu hands. Jvjt
serious answer could very well be given to
a piece of vulgar ridicule, efpecidlly if it
had no other foundation than the place ol
one's residence, or the corpulent, or fleudei
proportions of his body : in nee some men
of too weak, nerves to be ir tlie fun* <-i
filch weapons, retreated from the cci fl.c.
and left the game to terminate as i h net
should dirett. To recount the wo.tlj
charatters, uhich have been displaced m u
important offices, and lattifueti to the de
signs of thi* party, would txuid the ii
mitÂ» I haveaffigned ; they are well known,
and freih in the nunds of many e.f the Â£Ooc!
people of this flatfe.
It is remark-iblc that thr. ;!i the wln It

it, will agree in tliepofitlon endeavored t

Â»vhole fabric of our liberty, i epe.ds on
vigilance and attention in the exercije of tin
rights of election. Unlefsthe Frccuien look
tor themselves, they are li bit to iitipoli
tiou from all quarters. Thj esttenlive cir
culation of Newfp;'pers through thi. State,
might afford a competent (hare of infor
mation respecting the affairs of the public
to every iudividual. V. hatever appears in
the style of candid difcuflion, and is ad
d-efled to the understanding of the people,
ought to receive theirattention, but if Iro
ny, Satire, and Ridiculeâ , are adopted as the
guide of their judgment, they aie certain
to err.
At the last annual election, a sentiment
prevailed in all parts of the State, t!Â»at ii
was belt to make a change in the offite ef
Lieut. Governor. Judge Ellfworttt was
generally thought of, as a fnicable charac
ter for that pLce. But v hat was the op
position ? Not that Mr. Eilfwcrth wa:

Errors, than the gentleman then in officeâ
Not that his abilities were interior to the
other in any point of viewâNot that hi:
integrity was doubtedâNot that he d ;
not merit and poflefs the highest confide; ce
ot the people. No arguments orobjee
tions of thii kind were ever suggested. bui
the public papers teemed with the faint
kind of ridicule which has ever been the
chief iuflrument of the party in oppolition.
The Freemen were to be laughed onto!

Have the people of Connetficut no power
to change their rulers? Have they no dis

of government ought to be conferred ?
Are they placed under the conferration ol

The paper was indignantly torn by Ma

as an article of accusation agaiiift the per

adherents ; but such is the revolution c '
events, that this paper is noiv revived, and:

The paper in quefliou was loacdvcd ia
the following terms :
'â¢ Brethren and Feflotu Ci/izrnt,
The serene tranquility, tlie mutual cofr
fidence which prevailed ainongfl ns, during
the time of the late king's cfcape. the in
difference with which we beheld him re
turn, are unequivocal proofs that the a b-
Ance of a king is more delirr.ble than Iris
presence, and that he is 110': only a politiral
fuperfluity, but a grievous burthen prefl;iiÂ«
hard on the whole nation.
Let 11s not be inipofed on by Aiphifffls;
All that concerns this man, is reduced to
four points.
He has abdicated the throne in having
fled from,his poll. Ahclicat'o:: and de er
tion are not characterized be the ,'ejifith ot'
absence ; but by the firgle j;t ol fiijj.tr. In
the prelVnt iiiftance. the E ajs cvc.ythh .<â¢,
and the time nothing.
The nation can never give back i'scon
fidence to a man w ho.f !fe to his ;r.uU, per
jm ed to his oath, conspires a clanoelfirÂ®
night, obtains a fraudulent p"(l]<rrt, cor-tills a kinj of France under the disguise
Â«i a valet, directs hi > co'urfe towards a fron
tier covered v:th traitors ami deftrters,
and evidently meditates itVeturn into our
counn-y, wii.ii a force capable of jiupoling
his own d.-fpoiic laws.
Wiieuier ought nis fl gilt to be conlider
ed a> .1;, own act, or tile act of thoi'e who
fled wicli iii:u., Was it a lpontaneous re
loKuio.io; his own, or wasut inspired into
linn by otiiers ? The alternative is imma
terial : Whether fool or hypocrite, idiot
or traitor, he has proved liuufelf equally
t! iwiii t:iy of the vail important functions
that had been delegated to him.
In every fern's that the queltio.i can be
conlidered, the reciprocal obligation whicii
fubiided between us \i diifolved. He
JioUU.nolonger authority. We owe him
no longer obedience. We fee in him noxv
Jio more than an indifferent person; we
can regard him only as Louis Capet.
r.ie lultory of France presents little else
than a longi'eries of public calamity, which
takes i,s source from the vices of her kings:
We have been the wretched vitfims that
have never ceased to futfer ei her by them
or for them. Tiie catalogue of their o,>-
prellions was complete, but to complete
thefii.n of their crimes, treason yet was
"wanting. Njw, the only vacancy is filled
up, tlie dreadful lilt is full : The fyilein is
exhautted : There i re no remaining er
rorj for them to commit, their reign is
consequently at an end.
Wliat kind of office must that be in a
government which require* n.ither expe
rience or ability to execute ? that may be
abandoned to tnedefperate chance of birth,
that may oe filled by an idiot, a madman, a
tyrant, with equal effect, as by the good,
the virtuous, and the wife. An otiice ol
this nature is a mere nonentity ; It is <
place of fliew, not of use. Let Francs
then, arrived at the age ol reason, no longei
be deluded by the found of words, and lei
her deliberately examine, if a king, how
ever insignificant and contemptible in him
/elf, may not at the fame time be extreme-
Jy dangerous.
The tliirty millions which it costs to sup
port a king ill the eclat of stupid brutal lux
ury, pref. it us with ail easy method of re
ducing taxes, which reduction would ai
once release the people, and flop the pro
gref. of political corruption. The gran
deur of iiatio is confifls not, as kings pre
tend, u the splendor of thrones, but in e
coafpicuous sense of their own dignity,
mid ill a juit disdain of those barbarous
lollies and crones, which, under the fane
tion of royalty, have hitherto defolatec
Europe.
As to the personal fafety of Mr. Lout!
Caper, it is so much t e more confirmed,
a- France will not (loop to degrade herfeli
by a spirit of revenge againlt a wretch
who iia-. dishonored himfelf. In defending
a jult and glorious cause it is not pofliblt
to degrade it, and the universal tranquili
ty which prevails. ;s an undeniable proof
that a free people know how to refpef
themselves."
Having thusexplained the principles am
the exertions of tne republicans at tnat fa
tal period when Louis was reinstated it
full pnli'iliion of the executive power
â¦'hicli by hi -.flight had been fiifpended, I
re'uru to the firbject, and to the deplora
b e lituation In wii ch the man is now ac
tually involved.
Wnat w as negleÂ£ted at the time ofwhicl
I have been speaking, has been finc<
brought about by the force of liecellily
the wilful treacherous defects in the form
cr constitution have been brought to light
the continual alarm of treason and colil'pi
r<icy roused the nation and produced even
tually a feco id revolution. The peopli
have beat down royalty, never, never Â«
rife :g in , they have brought Louis Capei
to th . bar, and dcinonlfrated in the face ol
the whole world, the intrigues, the cabals
the falthood, corruption, and rooted de
pravity, the inevitable effects of monarchi
cal governments. There remains thei
only one quejtion to be conlidered, whai
is to be do le with this man ?
For myfelf, I seriously confefs that wher
I reflect o.i the unaccountable fol.y thai
rector d the executive power to his hands,
all covered as he was with perjury and
treason, 1 a n far more ready to condemn
the coaftituent alfembly, than the unfor
tunate prilbner Louis Capet.
But abitr.uted from every other conlid
eration, there i., one circumftatiee in hi:
life W.iicii. ought to cover, or at lead to
palliate a great number of his tranlgref
fions, and this very circum'tance afford
the French nation a blefled occasion of ex
tricating itfelf from the yoke of kings,
without <1 filing itfelf in the impurities ol
their blood.
It is to France alone, I know that the
United States of America owe that sup
port whicii enabled them to shake off the
unjust and tyrannical yoke of Britain.
The ardor and zeal which file displayed to
provide both men and money, were the
natural consequences of a thirlt for liber
ty. But as tJie nation at that time, re
tlra'med by the (hackles of her own go
vernment, could only act by means of a
monarchical organ, this organâwhatever
in other refpedts the objeÂ£l might beâcer
tainly performed a good, a great action.
Lettlien tllefe United States be the fafe
gn ;rd and asylum of Louis Capet. There,
nereafter, far removed fro m t ; le miseries
and cnmea ot royalty, he Iliay learlli

In i"ci itiiig tnis and in

mit i: as a citizen ot America, who feels
the debt of gratitude which lie owes to
?vcry French mm". I submit it also as a
nan, who, although the enemy oi kings,
:annot iorget that they are fubjeft to hu
man frailti/s.
I Cupport my proposition as a citizen oj
he French repubiic, because it appears tc
ue tlie bell, the moifc politic measure,
hat can be adopted.
As far a, my experience in public lift
extends, I hive ever observed, that the
jreat mass of the people are invariobly juli
)oth in their intentions and in their object.
>ut the true merhod of accompl fhing thai
â¢ ffect, does not always (hew itfelf ia the
irft instance.
For example, the Englith nation hat
groaned under the defpot'ifm of the Stu
irts. Hence Charles the firft loft his life :
,'et Charles the second was restored to al
he plenitude of power. which his fathei
lad loft.
Forty yearr had not exp : red, when the

cient oppressions, so the nation then ban
died from its territories the whole race
Die remedy was effec'ual. The Stunr 1
amily funk into obfeurity. confoundt dit
eh with the multitude, and is at lengtl
extinct.
I heFrench nation,more enlightened thar
England was at that time, lia carried hei
meafnres of government to a greatei
length. France is not ratified with ex
posing the guilt of the monarch. Ihe ha:
penetrated into the vires and horrors o
the monarchy. She has (hewn them cleai
as day light, and forever crufned that infer
ual system ; and he, whoever he maybe
that ihould ever dare to reclaim thofc
rights, he would be regarded not as a pre
tender, but puniHied as a traitor.
Two brothers of Louis Capet have ban
ifh.ed themselves from the country ; bui
they are obliged to comply with the fpirii
and etiquette of the courts where they re
fide. They can advance no pretensions or
their own account, so long as Louis fhal
live.
The history of monarchy in France, wai
a system pregnant with crimes and mur
ders, cancelling all natural ties, even thofc
by which brothers are united. We know
iow often they have afMinated each o
ther, to pave a way to power. As these
hopes which the had reposed in
Louis XV Ith. are fled ; the last whieh re
mains rests upon his death, and their litu
ation inclines them to desire this cataftro--
phe, that they may once again rally round
a more active chief, and try one further
etfort under the fortune of the ci-devani
iVJonljeur and d'Artois.
That such an enterprise would precipitate

It has already been proposed to abolifl:
thepunifliment of death : and it is with in

mane and excellent oration pronounced bj

The plan of the French is to carry on the
war principally against the commerce anci
the finances of England ; and one of their
chief objects will be, to deprive her for
ever of the carrying trade with America.
For this purpose, an aÂ£ent was lately dis
patched from the executive council tc
Philadelphia. They hope, also to feduct
our Weft-India iilinds, by opening the
ports of France to their commodities, free
of all duties, giving independence to their
own colonies, and inviting them into a
Foederal Union witli the Britilh islands,'
America, and France.

When Mr. Lloyd was removed from the

na. on ? Was it by mafl'acres committed oil
peaceable and unarmed citizens, who were
haning a petition on the' altar of liberty, in'

. It has, i-c'eed, been denied that Louis:
gave or ders to fire. Well, let it be fo â
Bitt if his wish had been to spare the blood
of the citizen;, why did he not give orders
to his guards to cease their firing?
It not be amiss here to oblerve, that,
a long time before this happened, the Na
tional Affembiy had begged Louis to dif
m:is the Swiss guards ; which he had con
ftanttyrefiifed to do. If all these circum
nces are not enough to convince the mod
prejudiced that Louis deserved the punifii
ment he differed, what possible crime can

American traitors, a hundredth part fc
culpable, as he, for whose fate To many

inviolability of thefupreme executive ; noi
that they fuppo ed it would consolidate th(
happiitefs of the people, but because it wa
advantageous to tllofe who decreed it.
I call upon the common sense of ever]
rational creature, to determine, whethei
there can be a more {hocking abftindit;
than that of the inviolability of a pubiii
officer. If the people were deceived b;
the reprelentatives, did they lose the righ

in his inviolability, was a public officer t(

SCEVOLA.
April 13.
Extk Acts from late French Papers.
1. The motives for the execution of
Louis are thought to have been motives oi
policy as well as of necelfity ; that his death
might be a terrific memento to all the
-browned fovereign.s of Europe. The fall
of the head of Louis will set the heads ol
all the European kings a quaking. When
George the 3d and Pitt hear that this head
is fallen, they will instantly raise up their
hands to feel if their own are upon their
IhouldersâAfter such an example, the peo
ple of every nation will fay, when they call
an eye towards their monarths â" In truth
these heads are not so Jacred, but that, il
found guilty, they may be cut oft' also."
2. There are at present few Eiijrlifhmeri
who do not feel and manifeft a lively re
sentment for the fate of Louis the 16th-
Th'ife however who belch out the' bitterell
imprecations agaiult France are not those
who most regret the unfortunate king. In
the moment of weeping for his fate, they
betray the joy of their hearts by inflntiating
that the confluences of this event will be
fatal to tTie new republic. A perv.fal of
the London papers will fufiice to rivj an
idea of tire 11-uumepts trt the nnniUerial
i.d oppolition parties. " Abllrafted from
the enormity of the deed (fays the gazette
ci.llcd The Times) the tragical death of
Louis will operate a great political advan
tage for Â£u. ope. Monsieur, Louis's bro
ther, will be recognized regent of France
by all the pou ers of Europe ; and we have
authority to believe that Great-Britain
u ill be one of the firft to recognize hi in a
such. The present moment is the most fa
vourable tor declaring war. .It is highly
probable that the proportion will come be
fore parliament next week, (Jan. 28.) If
the w a r j las b een hitherto deferred, it is
the of deep policy ; for at no period
was war ever more consonant to the wishes
of the people. Every tiling leads lis to be
lieve that Spain will unite Iter forces to
those of other powers against France. Lord
St. Helens is to set out to-morrow as am
bassador to Madrid, and we have no doubt
but Spain will act vigorously in concert
with England, &c."
The t.bove quotation contains the whote
leeret of Britifti mHllfterral policy. Hence
we may know how to estimate the value ol
the apparent neutrality they have hitherto
aroferved, and the lincerity o' their lamen
tations for the execution of Louis the if.th.
The opposition party speak more like
Viends oi liberty and humanity. They
nd*eed, in some fort disapprove of the ri
gorous fenfeVice againlt rfie late kiirg. a
entence. of the jullice of which poftc-ri y
alone wili oe the proper judges. There :
eafon to tliink this, party in the Englilh
nation lincerely delii't d the prevention t>f
th'e bloody catastrophe, and were eve. op
poled to the 'odious and infamous niealuies
which have been resorted to t'f combine
England and a huO of other w*rs agamft
France.â" The fric. d. ;,i liberty (f }-
the Morning Chronicle) have done every
thing in their power, as individual?, tofne
the unfortunate king. If our miniflry had
maintained the fame upright delign;. and
been equally zealous, there is nctt a 'doilfft
but Louis mrght have Been butthry
Â»iihed to make his death the great incite
neut to a popular war. War is now ine
?itaMe ; the popular argument ior i.t isj
the death of the king ; and tifed v ith luc
efs. The blood and treasures or England
ire now to be lavilhed, under pretence ot
â¢eltoring a nation of mad men to reason
ind humanity. To contend with lo.lv is
to be guilty of follyâno man of good sense
ivould dispute with an ideottâBut, Â£f&y
they) the French will propagate their tncul
'deat thro' the world.âBy v hat means ? â
The Englilh miniflry fay, the French want
:!tf tinewi Â©f war, and recommend 10 the
lation a crusade against France, who are
to be ealily crullied, because, it Teems, they
ire in went of every thing, and their inter
lal divilions will ruin them. If this be
ast, why interfere âwhy not rather leave
the French to dellroy fhetslelve ? â 111
hort, the folly of the E'lelilli is epidemic,
rhey are convinced that trie political sys
tem of the French cannot be eftaWifhed,
until yet they mult needs join in the com
bination to delh oy it."
*3. The follow! ig is translated from a Pa
ris paper of the Ift of February. It i
there given as a real extrail of a letter
from a Frenchman reliding in London
(dared the 25th of January, J 793) anrf
directed to his friend in Paris. J
"You were right iti refilling' to come
aver here. This is no longer a place for
Frenchmen, and tit this inftanr we,are ex
lofed to constant inliWt", efpecia|ly in pla
res. of public resort- The aristocrats arc
welcome at the court,and the coti..itution
fts are admitted into fonie societies ; but

general indignation that has been artfirffy
excited agai'tirt the French nation. Here
tofore v e were honoured v. ah the appel
lation of French dog, at ireieiu iti? French
tvger, with which it". eafs are con'antly
sflailed. There .re fcafVety'aftv resecta
ble French here now except pHefts As
to tiie friends of the republic, they are g'ad
to hide themselves an<l in no .Ihajte med
dle >vith politics fttr fear of popular in in it
and the inquisitorial eye of t e n;*.v b;i!,
which leaves 11s entirely to the mercy of
mini Hers. There is nothing here iti faÂ£lt
that affords fafety even for life itfelf to a
miserable French republican, except some
little remains of national spirit and piiblii
good manners. To Increase the htitred
against the French, the ministerial papers
are busy in inventing lies and calumnies,
and in order to give some colour ol justice
to Lord Grenville's inqtiili'tion-bill, they
pubHfcthat the French here are plotting
again!! the government, exciting a general
revolt, fcheining to take the tower, open
the prisons, and pillage the bank and other
national eftablilhments. The news oi
the execution ot Louis the 1 fitli has com
pletely the animolity of the Londoners,
not orilv or the class called the people, but
even of the more moderate, so that we have
110 friends here, at Jeaft none in pub:icâ
The news arrived yefteiday at 8 in the
morning, but the decree had arrived the
evening beforewhich limited the king's ex
ecution to 24 hours. The king and queen
were to have gone in theeven;ng to a p ay,
but caused notice to be given that they
would not attend on account of the mc
lancholy from France. At the ope
ra theypiayedCynjon, in wflich piecc there
is a proceftjpn where the insignia of tJic
fevcral orders of chivalry arc made to pals
in review. Y. hen the French (landard
appeared, liuTes, curies, and even howling;,
were heard from ail parts of the houie,
and rile scene was dispatched as fall as pof
lible. These colours were the old white,
and not the republican tri-color. 1 he
play Wifig finiihtd, the audien.Ce left the
houl'e and tlfe farce \yas omitted. Ycfter
day, al)_otib!icexhibitions were prohibited,
and this morning ail the minillerial papers
were bordered with black, as onoccaiions
of the greatest public grief.âAll this de
lignates a feriotis spirit of \\ar in the Eug
lifh. To counteract it and humble* it, the
republic itnift ciill tip all its strength, and
it is inimerife': that Freiich enthuflafiu
mutt be put in aiiion which despises fear.
The old arguments pguinft an invalron oi
England are now wholly out ot date ; and
depend on it,- it is a measure which the
Englilh dread above all others ; in faÂ£t it i-.
tire only decilive measure the republic car
take; and with 500,600 of the IblfiiefS ol
liberty, and a hnmlred million of affignSts,
1 could think no undertaking whatever a
ralh one."

PARIS, Feb. 6-
A deputation of the Du'ch patriots
at Paris appeared at the bar of the Nati

and presented the following addrtfs :
" Legislators, the pairiots of Holland
at length form a hope of feeing liberty,
so long oppr ffed, reviving in their cÂ»u'
,r y. The decree so worthy of you, pal
fed in the memorable fitting of the ill o !
February, will forever decide the fate o>
Europe.
" It declares war against the Stadthol
er, that is, against him who has eve
fhewn himfelf inimical to the French na
tion, who in the American wa r , enterec
into every intrigue that could tbunceraf!
the generous views of France, who reu
:lered useless the alliance concludid be
fween her and our'republi : in short, whi
[pared ro pains to (hew his h'tred of tht
French since they have recovered then
iberty. It is with justice that your de
:ree makes a diftindtion between William
)f Naflau with his adh.rents, and tht
ound part of the Batavian nation, tht
riends of liberty and equality ; among
whom we boast of ranking ourselves â
This equitable dillin&ion forms the ef
ence of your decree ; it is to us, not on
y the mark to which we yield our coufi
ience, but it demands alf& our nationa
jratirude.
" Legislators, for five years pall, we
lave been panting ast r this happy mo
â nent ; repulsed so long by every fpeciei
)fariftocracy, the hour is at L-ngth ar
ived, in, in which we can (hew ourfelvei
worthy to so low your steps, in which wt
lope that no intrigue of your enemies car
3re*ail against the national will. Som<
lew days more, and the fun will rife upon
mother free nation. A few weeks long
er, and the mouths of the Rhine will be as
ree as those of the Rhone.
" Legislators, despotism is laid low in
Franceâin other countries its fall is pre
paring ; the indignant people are every
where riling against the insolent tyrants
who had divided the earth among them
[t is to you,'t is to'the French that t e
j;reat example is due which has effranchi
"ed mankind.
" Shall we mention our principles, le
gators ?âLiberty and Equality, are the
livinities which reason offtisto mankind ;
thele are your'Â», ih y are otjr's, and wil
loon be those of the whole world. Le
if flators, if some flight mills have appear

lome diversity of sentiment has been per

-very cloud isdifpelled The great m a
Pure which you have decreed the commor
and sacred interest of the country, the val

as patriots, and a;'mire as. heroes. Ourin

and unhappy.â tew days since the town
us B H< n was (homing for the vidtories
of FRANCE, and exulting in the prof
psiityof a filter republic. The neigh
bouring towns joined in the fellivity ; and
â¢he gazettes teemed with toails, emanating
si si the feelings of liberty, pattiotifm,
and democracy. Wt did not then ce
lebrate a kingdom. We rtjoiced that
France was rescued from monarchy. Hei
ci-devar.t monarch was (l ipped of his roy.
ahy, and we congratulated France, that kt
was the prisoner of the people. But, he
is n w no more, the horrors of a trial, the
deadly images of the fc -ffold and trie ax,
have had acccfs to our feelingsâand the
world, from the tenor of our hewfpaper*,
may well conlider us as 'liftrafted with
pafiion. Certainly, we will do ou l selves the
honor to rcfle.; coolly before we decide.
Perhaps our moderafion, our prudence, our
mterell, and our reputation, a'l whilper us
to be iilent on the great occasion
The people of France have bee.i, for
several centuries, so inu.h opprefled by
their government, thai they had nearly 101 l
all ideas of the rights of man* They were
liable :o the rack, and the (lake, if they
ventured to have an opinion in religion
i lie bait le and the gallows, waited, with
great impatience lor him, who dared hut
to conceive a political fer.timent.. The
Princes and Nobility were exempt from
t xationâwhile the body of the people,
poor, naked, hungry and miferabl .-, toi.ed
to maintain the splendour of a court, and
the la a 1 fs diflipation of the nobles.â-
1 hat legal security which gives value to
poffeflions, and renders lif an objedt of
tlefire, was not known in that country :
1 tie lives and properties of the people were
held on the precarious tenure of the Will
of Favourites to a debauched and corrupt
ed government.
When a people, who have been long op
prefTed, rife to regain their freedom, tome
thing great and aflumfhing is to be ex
pected rhe mountain, whi< h long re
tains the melting lava, will burst forth
wi h an agitation proportioned to its re

yittim of the controversy. If the king,

if republicanism were infurmountabie.
We rejoiced when the National Convention

And, while we piti d the fallen monarch ;

But upon the dea'h of the man, who was

cause we conceive kings, (the reprefenta
rives of antient conquerois,) to be worthy

England, in a great meafuie restored ty
