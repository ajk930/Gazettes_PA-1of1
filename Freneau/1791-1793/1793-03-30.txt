Numb. 44 of Vol. ll.] SATURDAY, March 30, 1793.
For the National Gazette.
THROUGH the channel of jour ufeful
paper, Mr. Frencau, I beg leave to
fuggelt a few hints to, the soon to be, legi
timate children of Madam Median a.
This old lady, 'tis said, is now big with
youngs and will, in all probability, be short
ly delivered of a numerous brcrod.
How well soever informed in inecfical,
metaphysical, philosophical, and other mat
ters, the young onesmay be, feme sugges
tions, the refulc of observation, refpedting
the manner of obtaining institutional evj
dence of p-ofefiional abilities, may not be
unfeafotiable.
Know then, dearly beloved doctors in
embryo, that the birch, *- some time age
used, with the molt salutary effeits, in tilt
family of the aforefaid good old lady, ha;
been miflaitl. I cannot inlift that this in
formation iso. i.uich importance to von.
particularly when it is recollected, thai
clullneft, ignorance, and vanity, alone were
objeitsof correction. It would be pre
judging to iiilinuatc that any of you could
be clafled under either of the above heads.
At any rate this keep in mind, ' out ofyour
own mouths will I, " at some future day,
" judge you." Should gangrene orproua
flejh appear, (kill, urged by humanity, will
prescribe the knife or cauflic-
As you well know, the regulations o)
Alma Mater require, that each candidate
shall produce and publish a thelis on some
medical fubjedt; which is to be conlidered
the test of his capacity for dispensing health
to the nations. When we come to exa
mine this requisition, it really is not so ty
rannical as it, at sirs.' fight, appears ; for
remark, it docs not fay that the candidate
mult write. No, no. This would be both
arbitrary and unjust, nay it would be anti
federal.
A young man, for instance, troubled
.with excessive weight of brains, and niiid
dinefs of intellect, cannot perhaps conve
niently write, and yet he may be of good
ly appearance, flow spoken, and of fulemn
and cautious dememour. But what mult
he do? Let him get a friend to vamp up
something for liirn, out of the mass of mat
ter, already cut and dry to his hand, giving
the cheat as much as polfible th* complec
tion of originality. This done, he fathers
the bantling, makes 3 malk of his face,
mimicks the owl, and under the stile and
title of Do(lor proceeds, without either
fear or dread, to the business of death 1
It is, I am informed, optional with the
candidate in what language to write, on
this occasion. This undoubtedly is an
agreeable latitude of indulgence', andfuch
as may be beneficial under certain circum
stances. Subjetts, for inltance may be so
trite, that prudence would suggest the
propriety of difguifmg the borrowed ideas
in Come foreign tongue, latin for inft nee
But Should the candidate be ignorant of
this language, what a dreadful dilemma !
Here also recurrence mult be had to
foreign aid. A journeyman can be em
ployed, (consoling idea 1) who, magician
like, will, perhaps so effectually me t amor
phofe the fu'ojett. that even the original
author would not be able to know his own
ideas in their new dress. So much the
better. Should inaccuracies, 01- misappli
cation of terms be discovered by the hawk
eyed critic, it is a matter of very little im
portance, as this language, with some
others of equal infignificance, is proscribed,
and very jiillly, for they were dangerous
to liberty.
Finally, gentlemen, I beg leave to re
mind you, and urge with the mod pointed
persuasion, that yon would pay eCpecial at
tention to the bulinefsof dedication. This
particular will be of more real advantage
to you ill your future eftablifliinents, than
the fubjeft matter of your refpe<stive dis
sertations. Your situation is perfectly
similar in this to a man's, who goes to con
siderable expence and trouble in prepar
ing an entertainment. Now, if this man
be a clever fellow, in the liberality of his
heart, he will invite a numerous compa
ny ; and as men are, not unfrequently,
governed by interclted motives, he will be
particular in the choice of fucli as may
Ji3ve it in their power to befriend liiin
1110 ft.
Aghin. Would you not consider that
mill a fool, who alter he had prepared a
funiptuous banquet, invited but one ioli
tary individual r the hint I doubt not will
be ftifficient.
Therefore, I entreat von. to confnl:
your own interest, and invite every mo
thers foil of the profeflors, to your tiafti.

You may. poflibly, be unacquainted with

degrees of coniparifon, whereas you have
now need of three dozen.
In addrelfing the profeffors, tell them by
all means that they are " friends of the
science of medicine." Talk of the "le
gitimate principles of their respective
branches" their " humanity, liberality
and great ability, to relieve the dittrefTed.
and to smooth the avenues to death." Lei

JAMAICA,
January 31 âto February 16.
We learn from the windward islands,
hat the republican party at Martinique,
Jaudaloupe, &c. have so completely tri
jmphed over the advocates tor ariltocra
:y, as to banilh every one ol them from
he islands.
Upwards of five hundred of tliefe ex
jorted unfortunates have implored Iheiter
it St. Kitts, the governor ot" which is
ibout to charter a large veli'el to carry
hem to England.
In the latl and decisive engagement be
ween the two parties, each allilted by their
-efpective dependants, it is said, that more
:han three thousand of the latter were
billed on the spot.
There is not remembered a period dur
ng peace, when so many ships y.ere in
Kmgttonharbour as at present. Liguanee,
unfortunately for the planter and Ihip hol-
Jer, will this year contribute but afcan
ty portion of sugar for their freight home.
Some Englifn botanifls are now said to
be exploring the continent of South-Ame
rica, and to meet with every encourage
ment. Save emancipating their depen
dencies from that abominable rigid yoke
under which they are bound, the Spani
ards can fcarcety perform a more accepta
ble service to mankind, than by aiding men
of science in the discovery of the many
valuable plants with which the continent
abounds, and in the bringing their produa
and virtues into general use.
Extract of a letter from Bridgetown, Bar
bados, dated the 29th iujl.
" Many inhabitants of this town alTem
bled, and had the effigy of Thomas Paine,
with his " Rights of man," carried about
the town ; and afterwards burnt him on
the parade, in the green, jlift above the
Cage, while the band played God save the
king." [In the true spirit of fw-ine, who
are known to be so enamoured of the mire*
& filth of their enclosure, as frequently to
lacerate the hand that lets down the fence
for their deliverance.]
We underftaud, that an Irish paper
(which we hÂ«ve not yet seen) mentions
Col. Tarletou's difinilfion frim his Majes
ty's service, for having displayed too ninth
civisM a la mode a republique.
The Providence (Capt. Bligh) will not
fail for Great Britain before the latter end
of March. An earlier arrival in a north
ern latitude than the lhip will have, in con
fequencc of this delay, might prove ex
tremely prejudicial to many ot the plants
intended for his Majefty'sgarden.
In addition to the bread-fruit and the
many other valuable plants sent to the. bo
tanical garden, Dr. Dancer has lately re
ceived from the society ot Arts some feeds
of the New Guinea nutmeg, a spice little
inferior to the nutmeg ot the Moluccasâ
Should they succeed, they will prove a va
luable article for cultivation in this island,
account of the high prices
of the common nutmegs in great demand.
The breadfruit plants are divided as fol
low.; : To the county of Surry 83 ; to the
county of Middlesex 83 ; to the county ol
Cornwall 83.
On board the Providence are one or two
large boxes, and I'ome other ufeful arti
cles, made from the wood of the tree. It
is of a close hard grain much resembling
mahogany.
'The south sea plants, intended for the
leeward part of the island, are to be con
veyed there by his majeity'* brig Afliftanpe,
commanded by Lieut. Portlocke. Sl.e is
appointed to fail in a day or two.
Such of the plants as are to be deposited
at the garden, late Mr. Ealt's, were land
ed from the Providence yefleiday at i'ort
Augusta and Greenwich
Feb. 15. His majesty's Ihip Providence,
Capt.* Bligh, and brig Alliitance, Lieut.
Portlocke, failed Jefterday morning : the
â ormer for Mo: ant Bay, a.id the latter for
Savanna la Mar.
We are.afl'ured as a fact that, for the fix
large breadfruit plants, the property oi
Capt. Bligh, and now on board the Provi
dence, an opulent gentlemen offered the
sum of fix hundred guineas, which tin
Captain politely refufed,Â«declaring it to be
his intention to place them in the Botanii
garden, as a present to the country. A
noble intlance of felf denial that tc
our adinirationoi his character, and .vhich.
we triift, will not, for the honor of the
country, be forgotten.
The Otaheitan apple tree, the fruit oi
which is said to be of filth exquilite flavour,
grows in its native foil in fucii great quan
tities that Captain Bligh entirely wooded
the Ihip with its timber. The wood is
light, of srgreyifli hue, and, in filbltance.
fomewh.lt resembling common pitchpine.
The St. Vincent's collection of plants,
whkh are to be taken home by Captain
Bligh, has been landed and placed under
the ftiperintendence of a gentleman emi
nently qualified td fee that juftic? is done
them while they remain here. Dr. An
derfon, who has the ftiperintendence of
his majelty's gardens at that island, ha;
been collecting ever lince the Bounty firO
commenced her voyage, three years ago,
and made several voyages to Guiana and
other islands for the sole purpose of col
lecting native plants to enrich the collec
tion.
Those who are pofTefTed of the bread
fruit plant, fliould consider them as a sa
cred triift deposited for public benefit.
Independently of the immense distance of
the island whence they were brought, there
was not a plant onboard the Providence
that does not, on a fair computation,
including the prcfents made to the natives,
colt government five pounds sterling.
Taking in the efiiinates the expence ol
the outfit of the Bounty, her fubfeqtien!
loss, and that of the Pandora, togethei
with the cost of Capt. Bligh's last expedi
tion, the procifring the breadfruit trees.
&c. will not have cost government lefsthan
one hundred thousand pounds flcrling.
The whole lift of the plants., brought
from Otaheite by the PfoVidence, amount
to 595 in number.
The Providence touched at Timor for
the express purpose of making an attempt
to obtain the nutmeg plant, but notwitii
ftanding all Capiain Bligh's vigilance and
enterprise, not one could be procured.â
In exploring part of the country, one of
the fruit was found, which \> as planted,
and there is some hope that h will grow.
There are two male natives of Otaheite
on board ; one of them, we understand, is
going to England, at thedelire of hiscoun
tryinen, to learn the bufmefs of a ftiip
wright; the other came away without the
knowledge of Capt. Blighâhe secreted
himfelf in the (hip and was not discovered
till (he had been four days at sea. The
small pox being very general at St. Vin
cents, Capt. Bligh had them inoculated,
and they are doing well. The deport
ment of both is extremely gentle and tin
embarrafled, and they arc matters of a few
ps the molt familiar phrases in our lan
guage.
Capt. Bligh could gain no intelligence of
the mutineer Chriltian, and his accompli
ces, who were on board the Bounty. V hen
they returned to Otaheite, alter executing
their infernal project, the natives, fufpeft
ing some mifihief from the nou-appear
ance of the commander and the gentle
men with fiim, laid a plan to seize the yet -
[Total No. 14.8.]
fcl and crew, but a favorite female of
Chriitian's betrayed the cle/i|;u of her coun
trymen ; he put to sea in the night, anil
the next morning the llisp was nearly out
of fight.
Supposing (fays a - London paper) that
we should enter into an immediate war
with France upon so insignificant a subject
as the Scheldt, what would it end in at
lafl ? When would there be a profpeÂ£t of
peace ? Can we possibly believe that a Jin
gle campaign will compel the French, a
desperate people, to lay down their arms,
and restore the monarchy ? Have we not
reason to believe they would continue the
war lor ever, rather than do this ? Did
not the war with America continue for se
ven years and cod this nation eighty milli
ons of money, with the blood of an im
mense number of people ? And is it pro
bable that a war with France would colt
uslefs? Belides, the French would have
every encouragement to continue the war
with us ; because it would be a gainful
war to them. They would enrich chem
felves by the defh'Utiion of our commerce;
they would lit out swarms of privateers,
and be amply repaid by the capture of our
valuable Ihips from all parts of the world.
The Americans, if they did not join
them openly, would line their coads, and
all the coasts of America, with their pfi
rareers, under French colours ; andfearce
a (hip wouldefcape in their palfage from
the Weft-Indies. The smugglers 011 our
own coalts would do the fame, and join in
the general depredation, as they did dur
ing the lalt war. Whereas our merchant*
would have no incitement to tit out priva
teers, to make reprisals ; because neither
the French nor the American ships would
be of fufficient value to indemnify ti:e ex
pence, or even to defray the charges of
condemnation. But a further conlidera
tion is, that the Dutch, as we know from
former experience, would throw the bur
den and expence of the war upon 11s, be
ing a people governed entirely by their
own interest, and likely to desert us before
the end of the war. It would, therefore,
be a wife flep to avail ourfelvesof this fe-1-
rifh propenliryof the Dutch, by perfuadinj
ihern, it would be contrary to their inur
. to contend with the Frcnth, at this
urne, about so infignificant a matter as the
Scheldt. '
For it is evident they can gain nothing
by the war: & th.it we can ga'm
the war ; but that both 1 ;.â : inevitably
lose much.âAnd after all, v. iten peace liiail
be made, it is probable that it will he with
the humiliation of acknowledging the
French Republic, after an immense ex
pence of blood and treafcre ; a circum
llance which may be avoided, if we act
wifely, and (leer clear of the prtfent con
tinental disputes.
If we guard ourselves at home againlt
the machinations of republicans and level
lers, and take care to pretlrvethe internal
peace and fafety of the nation : which the
alien bill, the embodying the militia, and
the aflocUtions in defence of the confuta
tion, seem well calculated to do ; we may
flill preserve our present superiority anions
all nations, and continue to enjoy the t-lef
(ings of peace in an extended commerce,
an influx of wealth, and a higher tide of
:i:ofperity, while the poweis on the lon
:inent are ruining themselves by bloody and
;xpenfive wars, the natural 10nfcq11cr.ce
}f their folly and wickedness."

who brought hiin out, informed him, thai

with an account of war being declared of

vours to negociate for peace, viz. Rullia
Pruflia, England, Holland and Sardinia ;
Spain and Portugal Were not mentioned,
neither does the Captain recolleit thai
Aullria was amongst the number, but thi -
maybe owing to their being already al
war with that power. There were 41
fail of French fliips of the line ready to ge
to sea.
Tiie general opinion, however, was.
that this war will be chiefly carricd on b)
mercantile (hipping, as the merchants anc
every person of ability in France, will fil
out fighting veflels at their own expence,
which the government will commiflion.
There was no mention made at Lifoon of
any injury being offered, or intended by
the French to the queen or her childrrtiâ
neither did the French accounts fay a word
of any intention to bringher to trial. The
ilory reported by the Englilh ariftocratu
prints, of the king having been executed
in the court of the temple, in so indecent a
manner as was lately publilhed, turns oul
tobeagrofs falfhood, for it was at the
Place de Louis XV. and performed with
great Solemnity. That the French people,

that the day before he failed, the Spanifi

Juno were, that the king of France had

As a war between Great Britain am
France seems now inevitable, we with tc
call the attention of the American mercan
tile interelt to the peculiar predicament in
which the United Slates Hand, in cafe oi
such rupture.
To this end we have publilhed the trea
ty of alliance entered into between theft
Hates and France, in the year 1778.
By the nth and 12th articles of thi:
treaty, it appears clearly, that it Great-
Britain makes any attack on the Frencl
polfelllons in America (e.g. Weft-Indies]
we arc bound to aflift the latter. Now.
>t is almost felf-evident that the firft offen
live preparations of Great-Britain will lie
ceffaiily beagainit the French Weft-Indies
not only as they are the rnoft vulnerable
and difitffefted, but also as they promii'e
more national advantages than conquelts,
which inuft be purchased at much greatci
L-xpenditure of blood and treasure.
Whilst this however, appears the clear
interpretation of the text, we know not
how far ourprefent executive government
may consider themselves bound by a trea
ty entered into by powers 110 longer exist

At all events, the war will place this
continent in ail aukward lituation, be

their gratitude and public engagements to
France.

We hear from the town of Paterfon, ii
New Jersey, th.it a mechanic of that plan
lias invented a wheel to work by wind, ii
a horizontal position, which bids lair t(
become of great public utility ; the con
ftru&ion, in molt parts, differs material!)
irom any hitherto attempted for this cle
ment, and is in all points applicable where
wind, water, fleam or horses are necefla
ry.~ It is calculated to receive the wine
without the lealt change in the polition oi
the wheel, let it come from whatcvei
point it may, which totally removes the
objettion to the European vertical wind
mills, which require turning or setting al
every change of wind that takes place ;
and it is well known that nearly two third:
of the wind acting against the fails of one
of these mills is totally loft in point of pow
er, being exerted in a line of direSior
with the axis, while the construction ol
the horizontal wheel admits without the
lealt diminution of power the whole force
of the wind to ast upoiÂ» it, and from its
tapability of compression ill a peculiar
manner during its revolutions, nearly al!
counter resistance is done away, and this
machine upon its horizontal principles, is
fully equal to the European vertical
wheels, with only one third of the fame
quantum of canvass ; and in cafe of gust. l
or sudden squalls, the attending person.
can in a moment, with the ntmoft ease
throw it out of gear, and totally stop the
wind from having the least effect upon the
wheel, and consequently, prevent all thoft
damages which at fnch tiniest 00 frequent
ly happen, to the very great detriment oi
the mill and injury of the owner.
We hear, that " great discontents pre

A Rhode-Island paper mentions an infal
lible method to prevent the canker worm,
palmer worm, and some other infers from
committing their nfual ravages upon apple
orchards. The remedy is 110.other than
inserting a small quantity of quicksilver in
to the body of the tree a little before the
sap begins to ascend. The following is a
detail of the experiments of a reputable
farmer in Rhode-Island, who made this
discoveryâ 41 He had several orchards, but
the one the experiment was made in, was
an old orchard of very large trees. Nine
trees, the molt central in the orchard, he
bored with a fpike-gimblct about four or
fivefeet from the ground,an inch &an half
or two inches into the tree, rather slanting
the boring downwards. He procured one
ounce of clear quicklilver from an apothe
cary ; half an ounce he inserted into one of
the trees, a quarter of an on ice he inserted
into three trees in equal quant'ties; and
the other quarter of an ounce, as equally
as he could, he divided into five othet
trees. He then (Jugged up the holes tight.
This was done, I think in December.
Some weeks after he took out the plugs,
and found the quicklilver in the fame ftatt
he had put it in. He again plugged up the
holes ; and some time after the sap of tht
trees had began to ascend, he again took
out the plugs,and found the quick ilver was
gone, leaving behind something like the
(lime of a snail. The worms came as thej
had done the year before, and totally de
ft.-oyed all the verdure, &c. of all the tree;
except those nine, which were in as good
order as ever they had been, and yielded
their common plenty of apples, about one
hundred bulhels. The boughs of some oi
the nine trees interlapped, and were inter
woven with the branches of the other
trees ; and he said the fruit upon them was
equally good, while the branches of the
other trees so interwoven among!! them,
appeared as tho' they had been fired. The
tree 3 with the lead quantity of quicksilver
were equally protested or preserved as the
one which had half an ounce. He infertec
the quicklilver with 3 quill open at one
end. and the fide of it cut in the mannei
we make a pen, the more readily to let the
quicksilver into the quill."
We have it from unquefHonnble autho
rity, that in the two towns, Lynn and Read
ing, in Mafiachiifetts ,there are couflantl)
â fifteen hund ed persons employed in manu â 
facturing women's shoes. From the pro
duct of their labour are annually exported
from thence, to different parts of this con
tinent, 450x00 pair of shoes, which makes
a saving to the United States from the fo
reign importations of this article at 4ft
a pair, of 337,500 dollars; and they car
afford their Ihoes on lower terms than car
be imported.
" A total reformation (fays a French pa
per) has taken place in the republic ol
Geneva. Aristocracy and ariflocratic ty
rants are now rooted out, and under the
auspices of France, their governmen thas re
verted to the pure principles of democracy,
and frch as Athens might have cheriflied
in her mod virtuous days. Before this
revolution at Geneva, it is remarkable
that the mad despotic spirit of the tyrants
of Europe had taken full pofi'eflion of the
little ariftpcratic tyrants of this almofl in
visible spot of territory. These diminu
tive infects of despotism had the desperate
and audacious follv to throw their little
weight into the scale of the powers com
bined against France, and far from being
intimidated by the example made of then
neighbour, the late duke of Savoy, tliey
imagined that the victorious forces of
France would be repulsed before their
petty ramparts. In contempt of treaties
they invited Swiss troops into their pay.
It became therefore our duly to deliver
the people of Geneva from the tyranny of
a set of overgrown knaves, whole inso
lence deserved chaflifement, had it been
only for giving an asylum to our rebellious
citizens."
I From the American Daily Ailvertijer.~\
Is there a true American who does not
believe that the French nation is well dis
posed to this country ? Do not all of us
who have either as statesmen, soldiers, or
citizens, taken a part in the revolution feel
this truth ? Do we not wish well to that
nationâexult in their fuccefles, sympathize
with them in their misfortunes, and feel
mortified at their errors ? As men engaged
in an interesting conflict, they cannot be
alwaysright. But th- truefriends of Ame
rica, who will not juflify what they thinl*
wrong, will yet feel as true men ought tc
doâThey will espouse the cause of the
abfeht friend âand I fear that the French
nation are conficlered by some in that light.
Whylhould Americans conceal their Sen
timents ? We are all friends of equal poli
tical rights, but not the levellers of proper
ty, as is insidiously represented ; we have
more reasonâThe fuggeltion is a vile trick
played by the minions of the kings of Eu
rope upon the unsuspecting citizens of thf
nations of the world. The French anc
Americanpj-inciples on this fubje&'coin
cide. Let all the citizens,asfuch,haveequa
riglits under the government, that is,equa
political rights. But this rational fylteu
of equality which is the glory of the Ante
rican free conrtitutions, never meant thai
my indullry ninft: be exercised for another
The difference is so plain that all may fei
it. I may gain Â£. 10,000, and a thoufaiu
industrious men may gain as much and w<
may all enjoy our earnings and tranfmii
them to our pollerity. But if lam a ty
rant my people are slaves âIf I, and one
hundred of my people are tyrantsâthe red
are slaves in the fame manner âFor tyranny
in one or many, excludes the enjoy;:.ent ol
liberty in others of the fame nation. Tht
kings of Europe and their minilVers, have
not a doubt but property will be secure,
3ut they tremble for their exclusive privi
eges, their titles, and their power, anc
knowing that this monopoly turns upon the
monarch as upon a pivot. The prefem
war is of the kingly power againfl that o
:hepeople of the world. It can be plainly
hewn, if it does not appear plain enougl
already, that all the publications on the.
â¢oyal fide, a flume the principle that equal
ty of property is the object of the French
â¢evolution, when nothing is more falfeâ
The question turns entirely 011 thetquaii
yof political rights in the nation. Thi
jeoplc, we all believe in America, have
â ight to delegate to such perfiino of merit
is they think equal to the t (k, the powers
lecefl'ary for the adminillration of the go
vernment.

Nothing is a plainer proof of the flrong

ill her hour of distress and difficultyâlc
is well know 11 that the aid furnilhed by

Oil GiantsâFrom a Correfpondcnt.
That a race, or nation of Giants have
formerly exilled on this earth, has been
generally allowed by all who have relied
upon the faith of ancient hillory. Their
univerLlchara&er was fierce, cruel, murde
rous, tyrannical, and poflefllng llrength
and power only to turn it tothevileft pur
poses. In corroboration of the exiflence
of this monstrous species of human be
ings, as aflerted in history, lkeletons are
said to have I een dug up in many coun
tries, particularly Sicily (:he ancient
refiderce of the Cyclops) at leafl four
or five yards in length. Notwithflanding
all this, however, I have conflantly enter
tained doubts of the reality of the former
exiflence of these beings, either as a dif
tindl race, or as inhabiting at some remote
age, any considerable portion of the ter
re/lrial fuperficies of this globe. Should
we suppose the latter to have been the
Cafe, and that Giants were the predecelfore
of the present race of mankind, we mull
behold in ourselves a degenerated species,
tho' in fame degree of an ameliorated and
improved nature.
Tho' it would be rash to fay that no
Giants have everexifted on this earth, yet
from a close and candid consideration of the
fubjedt, one would be inclined to think
their existence has been only in figure
and metaphor.
It is remarkable that the charaÃeriJlic at
tributes of kings, despots, andg ants, are the
fame. There is therefore good reason to
conclude, that when ancient hiflory, or
poetry, entertains us with tales of giants,
or men 5 or 6 yards high, it means no
more than the despotic heads of nations,
who by means of their unlimited power,
and the bad use they commonly made of it,
were aptly enough styled giants, or great
men, who exijied by [pilling the blood of na
tions, and making the world a theatre of car
nage and desolation.
What considerably flrengthens this o
pinion is one or more passages in the He
brew Scriptures, where after mentioning
that giants had exilled in the earth, they
are called the sons or children of Anak.
From this Hebrew word, in all probabili
ty. was derived the Greek word Anax, in
English a king ; so that when the Hebrew
hi dorian talks of Anak, and the children o)
Anak, he can mean no other than certair
ancient kings and tyrants of Asia, a ract
of despots, whose crimes were at length
the cause of their deflru&ion, and out oi
which grew the Jewish and other theo
cracies, from an aversion in the people
(from what had pasTed) to be governed by
one of their own species, altho' this refor
mation was quickly the cause of nearly as
bad a tyranny in the persons of the priests,
who were a long time admitted as vice
gerents of the deity.
But after all that has been fa'd, if giants
have really lived in the world, there can be
no doubt but their numbers mull have
been comparatively few with the reft of
mankind. Their tyranny and oppressions
produced an opposition : and the inferior
ftatnre of men were compelled to unite in
their own defence ; they warred again!!
these monllers, and by degrees extirpated
them, male aad female, from this terres
trial globe.
The fame necefiity of union exifls in
this late age of the world to root out those
figurative giants, called hereditary kings
and emperors. Power was not made fcr
one man ; it can only, in the nature of
things, belong to colle&'ve bodies. Is it
not worse than madness then, to confer
unlimited authority upon any individual,
especially ;:s allhiflory has taught us, that,
with but very few exceptions, it never fails
to make even a virtuous mail a fiend of
darkneis, and an inveterate enemy to the
temporal happiness of his species.
From the NewTorl Magazine.
In the funimer of 1791, fcveral gentle
men (of diftin&ion) in the ltate of New.
York, made a tour through its wefteru ter
ritory. In their progress along tlie eall
bank of the Scneca river, fix miles foutf
of Grass and Salt lakes, and forty jnUc
south of the fore at Ofwego, they disco
vered a remnant of ancient Indian de
fence, unequalled perhaps even by the
celebrated vestiges at Muflcingum.
The principal fortification ij 220yardi
in length, and 55 in breadth. The ban!
and corresponding dilch are remarkably
entire, as are two apertures oppolite eac!
other in the mddle of the parallelogram,
one opening to the water, and the othei
facing the fore,ft.
About half a mile south of the grcatei
work, is a large half moon, fuppoled to bt
an out-work ; but attended with this fin
gularity, that the extremities of the ere
scent ai e from the larger fort. The bank
and ditch, both of this and the firft for
tress, are covered with trees which exhibi
extremity of age.
Over a fmali elevation in the great fori
the gentlemen observed a flat flone, fiv<
feet in length, and three and a half ir
breadth, and fix inches thick, which wai
evidently a sepulchral monument. Then
were a number of figures engraven upot
it, by being funk with a chifTel near hal
an inch lower than the general ftirface o
the (tone Upon removing the stone, om
of the gentlemen with his cane dug up'i
piece of an earthen veflel, which fiom th<
convexity cf the fragment he fuppofec
might contain twog.llons: it was verj
well burnedâlooked red, and had its up
per edge indented, as with the finger in it:
imprefiionable state.
It is remaikable, that in the enquiries
the travellers made concerning these fingu
lar conftrudtions, among the furroundinp
Onandagoes and other nations, they weri
so far from receiving any information tra
ditionary or otherwise, that the native!
themselves had never noticed it.
Perhaps the day is not far distant, wher
foitu American Gabii or Herculaneuir
cvill astonish the world with a western liif
tory, great, important, and interesting ai

Inventions and Improvements.
The science of Mechanics, is much in
debted to the ingenuity of Mr. Roltr,
Lejlie of the city of Philadelphia. Th:
following is handed to us as a lift of a
few of the inventions and improvements
not including those on time-pieces, &c.
which he has made during his residence
lere. Their merit will no doubt bring
:hem soon into general life.
A machine for threshing wheat, on a
lew plan.
A horizontal tide-mill, to work with
30th tides.
A boat to fail directly againll the wind,
)r in an) other dire&ion.
A horizontal wind-mill, so conftru&ed,
hat the wind adts on both fides of the
j'heel at the fame time.
An improvement on the common
Wheat-Fan, by which it is made to pro
luce more wind with less labour-
An apparatus for blowing the fire of
iny kind of furnace by a stream of water
without a bellows. The power of this
rontrivance may be increased to a greater
degree with a given quantity of water,
than the fame quantity could produce
if applied to giving motion to a common
bellows.
A machine for measuring a ship's way.
An improvement on carriage springs.
A flandard of invariable length, by
means of a cylindrical rod of iron of such
length as to perform its vibrations in one
fecÂ»nd of mean time.
A method of continuing the impref
lions in dyes for coining and other pnr
pofes, uniformly the fame as long they
may be wanted.
Several ufeful discoveries in tfiills &e.
[Ft cm a. â¢ch paper.]
It mud appcai -i/hing 'to philofo
phcrs that, uader ll; French govern
ment, prejudice {hoi Viave impressed a
chara&cr of difjrace upon the profttTion
of a comedian, whilst it highly honoured
other occupations of a kindred nature, but
far beneath it in dignity, such as those of
preacher and orator. We will not so far
disgrace the charadifer of a good comedian
as to contrail it with that of an crator, in
point of requisites of genius, which would
be like c< roparing a fkilful physician to a
drug-pounding apothecary. Our new re
public cannot too 11 inch honour a profeffion
which, if we wou:d hasten a regeneration
morals, will conllitute an eflential part
of public inltruÂ£uon.

PRINCETON, Feb. 28. 4W2av/
I Have claims to about two hundred and
fifty thousand acres of LAND in the state of
Kentuckey, in different parts of that country,
Tome of which 1 know to be equal to any ; all
which I am inclined to dilpofe of, either by
"ntire fair, or by admitting one, or two partners,
to whom the agency on the whole will be com
mitted.
One fourth of the contrafl will be required in
hand, either in ca/h, merchandise, or such aflets
as may be converted to a&ive use, the relidue
may be apportioned in convenient instalments.
The pure hafers to give security, on the land,
)r otherways,as suits them.
Knowing that there is a prejudice against the
titles of land in that (!ate, which is more general
than just, I am willing to stipulate in the con-
that a discount, or d-du&ion, shall be
madr, where any land may be loft, by reason of a
defective title.
Any person inclining so such a purchase, is re
quested to write to me by pert, in answer to
whom, more particular information will be given.
