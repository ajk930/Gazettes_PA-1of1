A nation is engaged, in defence of their

and remind them of their late glorious

the iron hand of dejpotij'm, and fubjeited to

Louis and his ancestors, and indeed Dili
perceived their grievances encreafe, as
years advanced along. At length, roil fed

to break the (hackles which confined them.
,nd overthrow that mighty Gothic fabric
if government from which flowed all their
evils.
Those brave and independent people, at
the dissolution of their old government, af
f'embled at Paris to erefl a new one. Still
attached to monarchy, which had been car
Iv planted in France, they eftabliflud thai
form of government among them, limiting,
l iowever, the power of the monarch. Lou
i and his successors were appointed to tht
hi? heft offices in the kingdom; Louis ac
eptedofthe appointment, and swore tc
rule agreeable to the conl.itution. He
freely and without compulsion assented 01
objected to the aÂ£ts of the national afl'em
bly. Louis at the reqneft of the nation,
invited the noblemen who had fled iron;
the firft tumult; which arose at Paris, to re
turn to their country, and share the privi
leges of other citizens : but these monften
wffhing to re-eftablifli a government that
gave them unlimited power over the Pr
ions and property of all other classes of ci
fizens ; and even allowed the father to be
imprisoned if he would not submit to tlic
protlitution of his beauteous ard innocent
daughter; These wretches re) used the invi
tation; but roamed about Europe, and
iailed forth the apprehenlions of its ty
i ants for their fafety, if they fliould not
co ilefce and crulh the infant, Liberty, in
its birth.
At this time Louis was treatc d \\ iih re
ject by. his conltituents, and received the
;rntitude of a generous nation, lor his ap
ready acquiescence to those ella
jlilliments. which lightened the burthens &
rncreafed the happiness ol the people.
ii!t nl is ! this generous behaviour proceed

[On the firft day of March 1793, the kin?
of Great Britain ifliied a Proclamation
for a general Fait in England, Wales, anc

following (fays a Boston paper) is t! 1
true English of the British proclamatiui
for a public fait.]
WE, taking into our most serious con
fideration, that the people of all Europe
itave folong groaned under the heavy yoke
of the Feudal Syjlemâhave been so griev
on fly oppreiled with unnecellary burthen
lor the support of monarchy and aristocra
cyâthat they are now obliged, in then
own necessary and natural defence, to raif<
against their opprelfors; b/ which the
r owns of all Europe are brought intodan
ger, and appear Jo totter 011 the heads o;
the despots: To prevent an evil whicf
WE have so much reason to dread, WE
have, with the advice of OUR Privy Coun
cil, thought fit to appoint a day of public
fnfliug a 11 prayer ; calling upon all OUI!
loving fubjeSs, to appear, and to hnn.blt
themselves upon this important and dread
ful apprehension ; thereby hoping that thi:
foletni.ity will impress their hearts with the
droine right of kingly power, and convince
them that the people are the property cl
their lawful sovereigns, liable to be fold or
leafed like cattle, as appurtenant to the foil
where they sweat out their lives, starving
for the support of their lawful matters.
And WE command all OURJubjeds, to as
semble on the occalion, and devont/y tc
re-peat a form of prayer, which WE have
ordered our Arch-Bilhop to compoie foi
them.
I t isfaid, that the Arch BifSnp will com
pose a prayer, in which there is to be the
following clause :
" Almighty, and most merciful Father
we do most humbly beseech thee, on the
behalf of ox; a tno'jl gracious sovereign
George the third'' and in behalf of all the
foveretgns in Europe, that light and :Â«w
---ledge may flill be hidden from the people
e)f all denominations whatever ; and that
the grofj & impenetrable darkness, so lonj,
and so perfectly continued under the feuds,
lyjleni, may be yet mojl mercifully sup
ported and upheld. And that thy fervaut
the Princes of Europe, and their nobles anc
bishops, may yet enjoy the divine right 01
eh J laving the People. And grant, Oi
molt merciful Father, that the valjals anc
the Jeitanjs, and all theirfubjeits maj yel
be co itemed in all godliness and honelty
to toil in peaceable and degrading servi
tude ; that the princes and nobles, by theii
labour may be yet indulged in all vice, de-
and folly; and that thy fervanti
the Bishops, their Curates and Deacons
may riot and grow fat 011 tythes which the;
never earn. And finally, that all the king
doms of this world, may derive fuppori
from fraud, cunning, b ibery, and the bleioc

And all kings, potentates, fovcreigns

By the (hip Amiable, captain Paul, arriv

learn, that Admiral Gardner, with fix fail

11 til instant. No land forces were on
board the fliips, it being fuppofe'd theifland
wou '! fi;rrender on the appearance of the
Knglilh fleet, but as general Kochambeau
commanded the troopsat Martinique, there
was no doubt of a vigorous refinance.

the accounts of the arrival of Admiral
Gardner, with a Brilifli fteet of eight fail of

which is the Chevalier Dubiic, and the
other gentlemen, who some time since were
deputed tofolicit the protection oftheÃri

gined that the firlt object of the fleet will
be t: e capture of these islands.
The latelt Engiifli news in this country
is to April it. âThese accounts generally
agree, that Dumourier had declared him

the re-inftatement of thedauphin. Duinou
rier's treachery and the plots oi the coun
ter-revolution.fts in France, appear to be
the great dependence of the despotic pow
er . to effect the overthrow of the republic.
On the 3d of April, according to these ac
count! Dumourier began his march for
Paiis, at tMe head of an army determined
0 reflore royalty, and was joined by crouds
nf people to aid his defigus. The white
Sag was flying on the tower ot Lisle, in
which place was left a garrifou of royalist
soldiers. The dauphin had been declared
king at Lille, Valenciennes, and Douay
All offenlive measures against France were
to be suspended during the execution ol
Dumonrier's planâa proof that the Au
ftrian leader was well allured of his fince
rity-âlt is added, that theinlurgent roy
al.lis of Brittany had tsken poifellion of
Nantz ; and that the Spanilh armies had
entered France in two places. Great con
fnflon prevailed at Paris ; the miniller
Roland, had been accused of being con
cerned in Dumourier's conspiracy, as also
the dtike of OrL ans (f galite). The Con

and fufpe&edperfons in the republic lliould
be disarmed, which decree had been rigidly
executed. From the above deta.l, maijy

[Continued from our lastâand concluded /
LOUTS CAPET then set forward or
fiis joupny, and after some hours :
travelling'. anived at the judgment feat o:
Minos. He trembled at tHÂ£ Item afpedl
of the Judge and his affillants. " Terri

mer imejit at Paris, before the revolution
But I will take courage, and (how him th
WILL, which my father confefToi was si
kin ! as to make for me ; and I am sure
/hall soon geti nto his graces."
Having thus fpoke,hethru(l himfelf int(
a or iwd of ghoft3 that environed the ba
of Minos. The judge d fpatched then
with a much hade as if he had been wel
paid for it : Some went away fad and de
jedted, others felicitated themselves on thfii
ientence. Capet's turn came at last, ani
Minos, with an air not over courteous, or
dcre(3 him to place himfelf in the bar.â
Ghojl- Do you know that I am a king ? â
Minotâlndeed ! so much the worse foi
you, thenâbegin with obeying my orders
Â£H-:re the dead man looked about !iim ir
that listless manner he was wont to do ir
his life-time, but feeing no guards at hi:
elbow to revenge the mortification, he pla

piy, and on the fame feat which but a few
minutes betr.e accommodated the fhoe
blocks of the Portt-Neuf, and the cÂ®ok
wench of hi., Valet de Chambre, Clery."
MinosâYour name Sir ?âGhojlâLoui:
Capet.âMinosâYour quality ?âGhojlâ
Alas ! for a long time part I have been o]
no consequence nor quality ; but time has
been that I was king of the French.â
MinnsâWhat, Louis the lad ? are you the
roan that opposed the jutl laws of nature,
and refe ved for yourfelf only, and youi
favorites, the rights which the intended
equally for all men ?âGhojlâThis is al
falfhood and slander: When I saw tht
feop.e prefied down into the dust by the
immense weight of taxes, I, ot my owr
mere motion and good will, convoked tht
States General, in order to give them al
the juflice that was their due ; and so triu
is what I fay, that from this circumlUnct
I was univerfa'ly called the rellorer o:
French liberty.â /I inotâThat may bt
true ; but when tiefe fame States Genera
had afleml led and issued their firtl decree,
which ir. :ome measure avenged the affroni
to nature, (he had so long experienced frorr
you, and your brethren in villainy ; fron
the effedt of that decree you began tc
perceive that reason had made more pro
grefs in the world than you had expected
and you immediately set about nipping tlÂ«
infant bud of liberty, in order to fupporl
your prerogatives of pride and cruelty
You fjrrounded the National Affembh
with hired guards, whom you paid and in
flru&ed to your wish Humble remon
fir nces were made against this ast of def
potifm ; your answers were uniforml)
cruel and equivocal, and yon imputed tc
tie disorderly spirit of the Parisians, ar
effedt proceeding only from your ftrugglt
for the recovery of despotic power. It wai
then that your people for the firfl time,
fh iok off tiie yoke of opprefiion, and madt
their great effort for liberty, in overthrow
ing and erasing f om its foundations, thai
detffla'.le monument which, alone, con
demns yon, known by the name of th<
Ballille. When you saw your design de
seated, yon inllantly adted the fpanicl, and
did every thing in your power to calm
down that resentment of which you hac
Ik-atly become the victim. You afFedted e
chai after of popularityâand (pi'y indeec
that you could) you found forgiving
friends who received you in their arms and
covered you from vengeance with theii
own bodies. How did you requite them:
Accustomed to abuse your authority, what
you had been entrusted with you threw
into t e scale cf defpojifm ; you confirmed
personal servitude, feudality, tythes, &c.
The declaration of rights, and all othei
public aels that had the freedom and hap
piness of the people for their objedt, were
rendered fruit'efs by your treasons, and
your benefadtors soon repented of con
fiding power in your hands of which yoii
were utterly unworthy. I will not men
tion your drunken frolics, nor the nodtur
nal reve's of your wife, whom you fliould
have put Into close confinement after the
affair of the neet lace, a piece of villainy that
comp'etely debased her in the eyes of al
nations. Neither will I bring into view
all her adve/iturt s of gallantry, the notorie
ty of which rendered you b >th objects ol
national contempt. I well know that for
a long time the throne of France has beer
occupied by cuckolds & whore-mallers; but
â ill this is foreign to your preferit lituation.
i. will nt mention the criminal correfpon
ience you held with contemptible legifia
iors, with your brothers., your
md your al ies. I will only speak of what
ilrittly regards yourfel-, or is nearly con
netted with your own history. How wil!
you clear yourfelf of the black treachery
as your flight from the kingdom, of which
you had every reason to fear a dilcovery :
You endeavoured to avoid suspicion, tc
gain anew the confidence of the people,
alwa. s too ready to grant it, altho'yon
only meant to break your oath, and thereby
put yourfelf at the head of tt>e armies oi
you' accomplices, to re enter France and
to enslave a second time men who wereo
yerloading you with caresses and tender,
ness. You were arretted at Varennes. L
you had died then, Capet, your people
would havefti 1 mourned for you,would have
pardoned your weakness, & have pronoun
:ed it the lad effort of expiring royalty
âYour memory wouldthen have been lony
dear upon earth, and at your death the
jatesofElyfium would have opened to yoi:
without much difficulty â But this was nol
your fateâlike a mean coward, you fuf
fercd yourfelf to be re conducted to Paris
where your entrance was the signal so:
blood and carnage. You then thought o;
nothing but a coalition of the tyrants oi
:he north, and at the very instant too wher
your fubjetts were still so affectionate as tc
:ake pi afure in feeing you, and providing
or you. fafety. I will pass over a multi
:udeof facts, which are but one tissue r :
reachery, that I may -tlend only to thofi
eading charges on which I am to founc
iiv sentence. Let us pass to the fatal Tent!
Df Aitgutl- Well may you tremble
This country resounds with the cries o

wretched capuchin sermon, which ever
your brethren nd adherents are afhamet
of. Capet, you are a notorious rogue, bu
I confefs you have Tome cause of excuse
You were habituated from your infancy t(

of which might possibly have been in you
but were never praÂ£ticed;you have facriftc-ec
to your passions a great part of your urifor
