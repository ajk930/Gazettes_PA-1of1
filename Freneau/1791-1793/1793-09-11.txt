WHEN the present ConstitUtion of Go
vernment was proposed :o the Citi
zens of the United States for their accept
ance, many serious objeitions were urged
against the principles upon which it was
conftruSed. âA numerous and resectable
party appeared in opposition to its adoption;
and, on its final eftablilhment, a powerfu
Tnineriiy continued to impede its practical
progress. Anarchy had been the evil pom
plained of under the oIJ system, and Ener
gy was recommended as the remedy in the
new. It is not then to be wondered at, that
in receding from tj>e one extreme, we
iliould approach too near the other.
It was not long before the revolution o.
France oflered to the discontented paity,
profpeitof redress. They beheld in the
French revolution that full-grown perfec
tion of principle, which they before pol
fefled t he delire Qf obtaining,without a con
ceptiou of the means, of a thorough know
ledge of tlie object; and thus the Unitet
States were alijlolt univerfall/ divided intc
the blind admirers, and inveterate enemiei
of F ranee. âThe former opposed with the
greatest rancour the measures ot our go
vernment, Jeemiffgly rather with a view oj
producing its diflolution tlian of accom
plishing a reform, while their real & sincere
willtes were, without doubt, pointed at the
great object of afllmilating the ConfVitutioi
of the United States to ah uniform am
universal Syftemot Equality and the Right
of Man. And at the fame time the ene
mies of France were distinguished by ai
implicit adherence to the ConstitUtion, anc
an indifcrimiiia;e admiration of its detefl;
and virtues. Zealous in the fopport ol
what tiiey emphatically styled an 'â¢ ener
getic Geverhrtlent." they appeared resolv
ed to deflroy oppolicion, rather than to ex
cite confidence and accommodate opinions
lathis fituatioo were the United States o(
America at the commencement of the pre
sent war between Great Britain and France.
At peace with the one, and in alliance with
tjie other âour ficuatioa was new and al
mod unparalleled in the political world.â
The declaration of war had been made b>
France âas allies by a defenfive treaty we
were not therefore obliged to become a
party to the Cornell:. 11l coufequence oi
which the Prelident of the United States
thought proper to illue a Proclamation,
declaring their neutral dispositions, and
enjoining 01 tlie citizens thereof to oblerve
" a conduct friendly and impartial towards
the belligerent powers."
This Proclamation, thus iflued, has be
come a fubjeft of universal fpeculatiouâ
It has been ably combated by the friends
of liberty, both on the grou ui of confli
tution llity and neceflity. It has been con
sidered as an aflumption of prerogative in
consistent with the principles of liberty
and universal rightâAnd it appears thai
the result of the investigation, even 01
these primary queltions, is at leafl proble
matical-
If, however, the President of the Umtec
States has exercised a power not altogether
warranted hy the ConstitUtion, or juftifiec
by the neceflity of the cafe, I doubt not but
that the citizens of a free republic wili
exteud their charitable indulgence to ar
error which could have arisen from 11c
other than the bell and most honorable
motives, and I doubt not that they will
conlider the imperfections of a great ant
faithful-fervant of the people as the venial
weaknefies of humanity, inseparable fron
the highest degree of wisdom fliort of omni
science 1
But if this proclamation had beenfufrerec
to relf and take its fate with other govern
mental aÂ£ts, in the torrent of public opini
on,lefs anxiety might have been occafionec
in the breast of that meritorious charaftet
who gave it existence.âBut such is the
wild an 1 savage appetite of Aristocracy.
that it is not fatiJfied with carrying the
point in contest, but it inuft receive tht
ratification of mankind to its ambitious
fcheines.
111 this manner have aflemblies beer
convened in v rious parts of the Union, tc
exprefa their approbation Â«f this Procla
mation not with the sincere defigil of giving
a fatisfaftion to the Prefider.t of the Unitec.
States, or with a design of securing aftricl
observance of the neutrality : but with
the mercenary view of calling an obloquy
upon the French nation, and of 1 xsitiug ai:
anjmoflty ajaiujl tfefir [uiaripifisf
And, where is the propriety of callingon
us to sanCtion that, which from its queftion
o:i able nature tfe mult tirft pardon ? Is it
not fufficieu? that the haggaid dayman of
prerogative {I?uuld dare fcreft its baneful
crelt tor a mbment in the Land of Liberty,
but we must be called upon to ratify the
foul corruption ? I call it with confidence
a " foul corruptionfor whenever the
power of exprelling the will of the people
relTdes in one man, this power is subversive
of the principles of equality and reciproci
ty,and can be termed no other than a Pre
rogative of Despotism.
Perhaps I (hall now be accused with tin
inconflftency of palliating as pardonable ir
pratlice, that which I have execrated as :
corruption in principle âbut supposing
corruption to exilt in the principle of oih
Conll'itntio-n, will not this vicious principle
operate as upon the adminjftrator:
of the government ? If the inflriiment b)
which they ast is Reformed, will not theii
administration partake of its deformity r
And when the bounds of duty are inde
finite will they not plead the imperfeftior
ai a palliative for encroachment? Tc
conclude, is not the Conflitiition of the
United States in many refpetfs, incdM
PLF.TE, INCONSISTENT, and SUSCEPTI
BLE of Amendment ?
To thislaft quefticn some will reply with
ihe loud clamourous affirmation of high
toned Democracy and tinreftraincd licen
tioufiiefsâWhile others with the wary re
serve ofariftocratic importance, or with a
sneer of confciolis security i 1 the poUeflloti
t>f unmerited honors, will caution us to be
an our guard against the faHatacifm of de
magogues, and the enthtiliafni of the vul
var âThey will tell us there i> a natural
arlftocracy in every nation, which mult be
â¢eprefented by ajuperior order, nd fup
"orted in fuper'or Jplendor ; and thus b>
the honest and mifgnided zeal of the one
:art.y, together with the impudent and ar
cogant presumption of the other, the mn
:ual and reciprocal good of the whole is
,ort and forgotten.
And what is the caij't of this animosity r
The want of a liberal and enlightened fyf
em of moral and political philosophy. 1 he
want of that system which inult ceacf
mankind that the good of the whole, and
jf each individual, are universally recipro
cal.
And if the system is attainable, 'to what
causes are we to be indebted for its eltab
liiliment ? To this interesting q'uellion the
philosophic mind replies svithout hehtation.
Co the Revolution of France and. the pre
valence of French philosophyâTo the ge
neral difi'effiiiiation of that philolophj
which his eftablilhed in the tumults of wai
and the dissolution of empires, this lacrec
fundamental of universal happiness anc
philanthropy, " Liberty coniifts in the
power of doing every thing that is not in
jurious to the rights ol others."
It has been argued in favour of the Pro
clamation, that it was necefl'ary as a forma
ast of government, and at the Jame timt
that the people might retain their predilec
tion in favour of France in their individua
capacities. But, we now behold the aristo
cracy in a new and more formidable lhape
We behold them summoning the people
together for the express purpose of decla
ring as individuals that they will observe s
" condnftfriendly and impartial toward:
the belligerent powers," at the fame time
that they are bound not only by solemn Iti
pulations of treaties, but by every tie ol
interest and gratitude to grant particulai
immunities and privileges to one of thole
powers in preference and to the exclufioi
us all the others ! However such a decla
ration might comport with governmental
policy, it was to have been hoped that the
Dopular voice might have been unpollutec
by profefiions in favour of tyranny.
There is one consideration which alont
ought to forbid us from making a declara
tion in favour of the Proclamation, which
is, that with such.a declaration is necelfari
lyconnefted an avowal of sentiments liof
tile to the liberties of France, and conse
quently to our own.âAn opposition tc
principles inevitably involves an opp6fitioi
to measures proceeding from similar prin
ciples ; and as the Proclamation has beei
Supported ou principles an J by persons ini
mical to general liberty, it is to be hopct
that we (halt not concur in their views anc
abet their designs,
By giving the fanftionof the public voice
to the Proclamation, we (hall involve con
sequences which do not immediatc!y;ppear
on a cursory view of the fubjeft ; as in the
tirft place, we lhallratify anafi'umption* ol
power, and" au infrhigenjeiit of the fufida â â 
mental rights of equalityâSecondly, we
(hall fay ameafure so general and notorious,
create i c'uldnefs with the only nation on
e: rtl. to which we can look up with that
confidence ariling frem a similarity ot' prin
ciples, and a mutuality or' intereih ; and
laftl;, -ve (hall incur the contempt ot" Great
Britain, and all the combined powers, by
Inch a pnlillanimous adjustment ot'our po
litical IVntimehts to the versatile antl ini
quitous policy of"ddf'potic courts.
Bearing then in mind,that as with France
we survive, with France we peri (h J 'may
we pursue that line of conduct which fliall
molt favour her interest and our own tran
quility. r.hich will, without doubt, be that
jfafjflemof neutrality'conformable to,
and under the mollification of., ex'Jliilg
:i eaties, and not by exprcllisg that we will
n;rfue (t a conduct friendly and impartial
owarris the belligerer.t powers."
These observations are with deference
Ã¼bmitted to the public, by one who pro
files himfeif an enemy t<3 pernicious prin
iplcs, wherever they may be found, and
26/ to mi (taken men sby one who wi flies
.veil to the governors of the United States,
it the fame time, that (ufmg the right of
?very free citizen) he disapproves of lome

* Although the Proclamation may pojfibiy
lot be an Aflumption of Power on the
principles of the Conilitution, it certainly
son the principles contended for by a

Jnited States, and in that sense termed an
' jufripgeiuent of the Rights of Equality.

INLETS.
THE sea coast of New-Jersey, like thai
if the greater part 6fthe United States.
:Â»nlilts of a frontier of fea-i(land% with
"ounds of more or lets extent within, ge
lerally from 5 to 7 feet in depth, and com
uunicating with the sea thro' inlets that
eparate the islands. The islands are uni
"ormly long and narrow, frequently mere
rtnd banks thrown up by the sea, without
i bush or a tree on them ; in other parts
:overed with wood, particularly a ("mail
pedes of cedar, and more southerly wkli
lve-oak, palmetto, &c. On the cuall ol
Georgia and S. Carolina, these illands be
come pleasurable retreats, and exhibit de
lightful and romantic scenes. The fame
may be said of those on the coast ot Flori
da. The island of Amelia is a verdant Pa
radise.
From Sandy Hook to Cape May there
is an abundance of inlets, which admit the
flood tide with rapidity, but in general tnej
are so narrow and (hallow, that while the
tide ("wells on the main beach,at an average,
ix. feet, it scarcely l ifes more than twe
feet and an half in the founds within.
The firlt inlet we meet with fuiith o(
Saiiniy Hook, is that Â®f Shrewfoury, which
jives entrance into a river tof the fame
name, running several miles into the coun
try, in two branches, one north, the other
011 th. The bar on this inlet is very dan
gerous, and at present only admits petti
jugers, and other flat veflels, of not more
:han j feet draft of water. The entrance
a'f the river is about eleven miles S.S.W.
as the light house.
Squan inlet is the next in ofder, about
;o miles from the Hook, very fliallow and
scarcely pafTable by the fmallelt boats. A
few miles further we come to Barnegat
inlet, which admits vessels of 6 or 7 feet
draft of water into a large bay.
Cramberry inlet is the beit on this part
of the coast, and here at full sea a veflefw itt
a pilot may carry in ljfeet water. The
south channel is at present the belt. From
this inlet we enter a spacious bay, anc
lteering westerly, Toms river, which will
carry a vessel of 30 tons several frilss up
ths country. Lumber and tar are the on
ly articles of export from this river.
Little Fgg Harbour lies 60 n iles from
the Hock 111 lav. 39. 30, and is by far the
belt inlet on the whole Jersey sea coast.
Captain Dennis of the Vigilant cutter, has
carefully surveyed this channel, and given
the following directions to such as may
have occalion for entering it.
â¢' WHEN you are in the lat. 39, 30. N.
and wilh to proceed into L'ttle Egg Har
, boar, run in far the land till yuu discover
[Total Numb. 195 ]
two beaconj on or near the extreme point '
of the In . beach. Bringing then,in one line
they will bear W NiW. from you. Run in
that direction till \ cu pass the (outhbrealc
er-head, which lies on the larbord hand.
You will then discover two beacons on
Tucker's beach, bearing S. VV.byS. at
the fame time Tucker's lioufe will bear
S. W. By fleering in this direction, you.
v. ill carry in 12 feet water over a middle
ground, which lies on the llai bord hand.
Eut in order to keep the best water, yon
ft haul close in with the south breaker,
is the re is no danger within half a cableli
length, where you will carry from ;6to 18
feet Water, and regular foundings on the
[iarbord hand, with fufficient room to work
1 top-fail veflel, that does not exGeed 12*
reet, but with a leading wind you may run
n with a draught of 1401* 15 feet, with

leach, W. N. W. is your course to the
t" ox Burrs, or Welt Marfli, which you may
ie along fide of with fafety, in 16 feet
A-ater. This harbour is very convenient
n the winter season, being free from ice,
md several other obstacles.
The beacons on the N. beach aretwd
pars, 45 feet in length, ami a sixty gallon
:afk half way up ; and a ten gallon calk on

lalf way up, in a horizontal direction, and
black. rhefe beacons are perceivable at
!ix or eight miles dillance."
Between Little Egg Harbour and Cspe
Vlay, there are a number of inlets, but
lone of a.<iy conliderable conference, ex*
:ept that of Great Egg Harbour. 011 th~
jar there are from ioto 12 feet at full

[From the General Advertiser.3
IT has been said that the combined flee(&
jf England and Spain, have failed to attack
Touiou. To (hew how improbable such
in alfertion is, we are favoured with the
'(â Mowing account of the amazing llreneth.
3f that city.
Toulon is defended by at least 700 pieces
if cannon, inoft of which are 24 and 36
sounders. The entrarfce into the har
lour is about two miles wide, and is de
fended firft by a battery of 12 camion oit
:ape Sepet, near which is a signal tower ;
lext by another battery of l'Hopital, of 10,
immediately opposite this by the Grande
Tour of 20. Fort La Majgue of 200 guns Sc
iniong these some calverines that carry
ipwards of 4 miles, and are 18 or 20 feeC
ong, fs immediately behind Grande-Tour,
irotefts also the entrance and commands
:l>e great road, De la Valette, on the fide
afSavoy.âPetite-Tour of 12 guns is also
nearly opposite Grande-Tour,and is thelall
fort at the end of the arm of the sea which
torms the eutrauce into the bay of Toulon.
The pafl'age from this place te the citi ,
about two leagues, is extremely narrow.
:rooked & difficult,& can be navigated only
Dy the affiltance of buoys which mark the
:hamiel and may be ealily removed. The
whole of these two leagues of bay is wirh
n the reach of the cannon of Grande ami
Petite-Tour, or of the batteries ofTou
on ; which are in double tiers, the whole
ength of the port and extremely formida -
ble. So much for an attack by sea, which
co fail of the line would not be late in
lttempting.
If troops ftflOuld" be landed to tbe weft or
Toulon, which would be very difficult
rom the abruptness of the shore, (till they
ivqtild meet with iiifurmountable difficul
ies in an attack on Toulon in this quarter
fhe old fortifications of this city have been
trengthened by the addition of new walls
ig'ainft the old, anil an additional ditch j
ort Louis on this fide presents also a for -
nidabie pbltacle; but besides, in this
quarter of the environs it would be impof
ible to attempt a (lege,for breaking ground
s impraclicablc, owing to the inimeruui
:oiffiderable springs of w atei, with which
he ground abounds.
On the eattern fide of the city, nature
lasoppofed few obflacles, but art has won
lerfully encreafed them. Fort La Malgue,
if 200 guns,â we have already said, com
mands this quarter; from this fort to the
:ity is a covered way, from which an ene
my could be much annoyed, and besides
these, are forts St. Marguerite of 40 gun: ,
Artigne of 30, and F.ron v f 12, which all,
from different heights command the resit
aud plain "below The Jail fpir.uuaf'ifort is lltnated on a rock so steep and so
illfficult of access, that the cannon with
which it is fortified were obliged to be cud
on it, the materials being carried lip by the
labour of men. This fort, however, not
withllawd'iHg its height, has tile ad vintage
of an unfailing spring of Water.
It vvas on this si.de that in 1744, prince
Eugene attacked it with a formidable land
force ; but after a two months' fiejje was
obliged to abandon the enti rprize. This
quarter can also be proctfted by fiiips,
whose cannon may be bro't to bear upon
an enemy beywnd the covered way. Thi>
was fully experienced at the attack by
prince Eugene, whose a. my was put in
- great difordcr by the fire of four lliip
brought there during the nipjit. Toulon
has a fortified port, in which a confidera
b!e fleet may be kept fequre and used in
cafe of need, at a short warning. Its gar
rilon is generally 12,000meu, half soldiers,
half sailors.
REFLECTIONS on ftvetal SUBJECTS.
1. There is a certain party in this coun
try, who in politics maintain tha-fame per
lecuting spirit as actuated the old catholics
a century or more ago in matters of reli
gion. Enemies to free dlfcnfiiOn, they
gnarti their teeth at all who prefti'ne to
speak a different language from themfeives,
or even hint their difVent from what is ve
ry absurdly calicd the reigning politics of
the land. Are the United States in a firiu
ridiing condition ? It is instantly af'cribed
to the wisdom of tne party, when it is evi
dent that peace, indoftry, and our increaf
,ed population are the real causes of what
prosperity there is among us, rather thai]
dark paper tricks and jobbing contrivances.
âThis party also call themselves the go
â¢oemmeiit : and are angry if the m'oft un
limited confidence 13 nut reposed in them.
Hence fait hand not truth. becomes their
political motto, and (as in all religions e
itablifhed by law) they take care to substi
tute my {icy for knowledge, and require a
Tjlind idolatry, where even simple beliel
ought only to proceed from the mull en
lightened conviction.
2. The funding JyJ}em will for ever re
main a blot upon the chara&er of the admi
niltration by which it was framed. The
inteÃt of it vvas to enable speculators and
moneyed men to defraud the public of the
paper securities they poflefl'ed, There wa:
a time (may it never return) when specu
lators coulil calculate events in Congress
The wounds fufFered by individuals from
paper money were healing, bnt by convert
ing this ideal fabric of w ealtb into a fyflem,
a few cunning individuals have been able
to lpeculate on the property of a nation.
The ajfumption is a finking feature of this
fyflem. The people asked for no fueh thing,
nor did any urgency press it. But it fa
voured the views of administration ; ftatc
debts fold at a low rate and therefore
might easily be monopolized. In lliort, the
funding system was intended to efFea what
the bank was contrived to accelerate ; Â»iz.
nn accumulation of great wealth in a few
'hands; apolitical moneyed engine; and,
lastly, a fupprefliou of the republican ftatc
aflemblies, by depriving them of the poli
tical importance retailing from the impo
sition and dispensation of taxes. The
whole original design then of this system
was to destroy the conftittition, and to e
reÂ£t upon its ruins a usurpation, not fane
tioncd by the national will, or acknow
ledging tbe fundamental principle, that
the people are the only legitimate foun
tain of civil government.
3. "It (liould be one great object of every
honest governn ent to counteract and dis
countenance a certain love of diliinttion,
generally mod obfervablg in the vain and
Worthless members of a community, but
more or less prevalent in all mankind, and
always operating towards the support of
arillocracy in any government, efpecialiy
â where foftered by influential or govern
mental mjn. We are told the Saviour of
the world was unacceptable to the Jews
principally because his million was not
amid the blaze of temporal and princely
splendor, but rather in the garb of humili
ty and despised poverty. The French con
ftitutiun being founded upon the broad ba
ils of equality of political rights, or in
other words, giving the poor man the fame
rights as a rich one, in point of political
privilege, has consequently become odious
to the royalists and ariftotrats of every
country. Perish their principles with them !
and may that system speedily fall into rain,
which establishes the happiness of a small
part of the human species upon the misery,
and degradation of millions.
4. As the ancient enemy of mankind
took his feat on a certain occasion anions
the sons of God, it cannot be denied that
abundance of paper men have, in times
pad, in like manner been introduced into
â Congress, or been changed into paper-men
after they got in. From that moment, as
far as lay with them, the public good was
facrificed to their private interest. Hence
too, an unnatural allianceâtook place be
tween certificate and bank-flock holders.
The public money is depolited in the bank,
and tfie higher the taxes, the more of this
Snoney is lodged therein, and consequently
the more paper the bank can circulate oil
sj:s credit, the grcate.r will ba its pro-
Tits. If the bank will stick by a niinifler,
a m'nifter will {tiek by the lt nk. The
amount of taxes and loans are known from
the minister's ediinates, and when these
are laid before Gongrefs, paper-men in a
bundance step forward to support them,
having a private interest in'fhe accumula
tion ot public burthens ; and thus the mea-
Uires escape that itrict dlfenffion which
they ought ever to meet with from unbiaii
ed representatives. If a minilter fliould in
this way accommodate the bank, and turn
bank flock-holders into members of Con-
the bank and such members, may
alio accommodate him and his>fiieuds.
Odcalional accommodations of money, o
perating to acquire an influence ih Cou
grels, may be eaiily obtained by means of
a good understanding ; and a good under-
Handing is eaiily formed between good
friend;, united by the tlrongell of all ties,
mutualfipport.
5- Thole who observe the events of the
present day, -will refieft with horror and
indignatioh, that the moment a good un
derstanding began to luanifeft ii("elf be
tween the people of the French and English
nations, the court powers of both set them
elves in dirett opposition to every idea of
"heir mutual fricirtlfhip. The Britilh court,
leiug Hill in'<?xittence,have well succeeded
in reviving the old popular animosity, and
ill the virulence of national hatred ugainfl
:heir gailic neighbours. Hence we fee
:heir sailors ifill aduated by a ferocious
md cruel spirit ; a Frenchman when ir.
:heir power, is treated as their natural
'tieiny, a term of Kn'glilh growth, and
which, as Paine well observes* can, and
>ught,to be applied to tht devil only; & not
:o any nation of our fellew men. Thii
:!eltruÂ£tive principle, however, of national
itiimolitv, excited by the artful and male
i'ol?nt spirit of monarchy, is growing ovit
>1 fafhion, and we ihali certainly find that
ivhen a general friendttiip prevails between
he people of different nations, courts and
cings will inltantly bG annihilated, or ra
her their fall will bea natural confequeilce
it a friendly coalition among mankind,
onnded upon the t,afisof lieeanu universal
:oimr.erce.

Extract of a letter from Maryland, Sept. 5.
â¢' Some persons are much afraid of of
fending Gieat-Britain, and thereby brine
nig the refeutment of that nation on the
L lilted States. Put what has America
moie to fear from Britain than from any
other nation : or what has America done
to draw down BritiOi indignation upon us
more than that of some other powers. The
favour granted to the French, to fell their
prizes in our ports, extends to all the ene
mies of F ranee. Ihe fears of certain per
sons are- therefore grotmdiefs, for nothing
has been done to give the I'.nglifh the lealt
offence ; but the most fhameful indignities
have been fliewn by them u> the American
flag. A very learned gentleman of the
law, it is true, has given it as his opinion
on the 22(1 article of the treaty with
France, that we have given ground of coni-Â»
plaint from England ; but that gentleman
is known of old to be extremely unwilling
to fay any thing agaiult a nation whom
many among us seem so afraid of offending.
The language ofthe aad article plainly im
plies, that " altho' other nations are pre
vented from certain privileges, yet the
French by no means are," or certainly the
treaty would have beea more explicit :
becanfe the delign of treaties is to give
particular advantages to the parties form
ing them. It was natural, 011 citizen Ge
net's coming to a newly cftabiifhed repub
lican government, in alliance with France,
to expect much more of a patriotic and
sympathetic spirit among a people who
have but in ft emerged from
oppression, than what he has seem Tiie
fact is, the sentiments of the people at large
have not been taken, and the few who
have written on a candid explanation of
the treaty, were faltely accnfed of being
influenced by Mr. Genet. The mifrepre
fentatioH of the treaty, has for its object
the reparation of America and France, left
liberty fliould triumph over intmarcliy, end
equality over despotism."
In the feflion of the National Conven
tion on the 4HI of June, " a band of black
people, of both sexes, amidst the found of
martial music and efcortcd by a vast croud
of Parisians. came into the hall, to return
thanks to the Legiflqtors. for having raised
them to the rank of MEN. The President
gave the fraternal kiss to asi old Negress.
114 y,earÂ» of age, and mother to 11' chi

ducted to an arm chair, and seated at the
right hand of the Prefulent, amidst the
loudest bursts of applaufij."
F.xtraa of a litter from Full's Bay Set

" The eleaion of a Negro to serve as a
town clerk of Eafton, has given cause of
no little difgtiit in Charleflon, and some
other places of this ft.rte. It isconfidered
as a kind of eccentric aa, and operating in
tome degree contra bonus meres. W ehave
many negroes even here, vhofe real merit
and acquirements would perhaps entitle
them to be town clerks of'Charlelton itfelf;
but that is not to lay that the city of

Protections are granted to American sail

preff'ed, and in two inftnnces have been

protection had been granted them. The

protect him in any other place than the

he was oblged to fend for a taylor to moa

went 011 lliore ; and yet this mate h id pro
perty on board to the amount of mmj
thousand pounds, and will probably be ap
pointed to the command of a vell'ei in less
than fix months."
Last Sunday morning between three am
four o clock, a very alarming tire broke
out in the back buildings of .Mr. Kennedy 7 :
house, in Second between Market am
Chefnut-ftreets, which soon communicatee
to Mr. Dobfon's printing-office and the (fa
bles and warehouses contiguous thereto
all of which are entirely conrnmedâ Tht
difficulty of playing on the fire in this con
fined place, was found hi be considerable
and notwithlfanding the usual exertions ol
the Fire 'Companies and Citizens, it wa'
one of the most eibftiifate fires to extinguift:
which we remember, indeed it is hard ti
fay to what extent the flames would have
spread, had it not been for the capita
manoeuvring* of the crews of the French
frigate La Precieufe duel the India fhif
La Ville de L'Orient, who came with theii
portable engines and forced themfelvesintc
the most dangerous llations where thej
could play upon those parts where oui
eugines could not be continually applied,
Too 'much praise cannot be given to the
officers and men from thele fliipsâtwe
persons were killed in the dreadful catas
trophe and several badly woundedâthe
fire was a: length got down about five
o'clock.
Another account of the eleftrnftive fire
on last Sunday morning is as follows :
" At about half p ift three o'clock the
soap-house of Mr. Andrew Kennedy
(Chand'er), back of his dwelling-house
in Second, between Market and Chefnut
ftreets, was discovered to be in flan es
The citizens were soon apprized of if, bui
were not able to flop the progress of the
f re, u.itil it had done very considerable da-
Two buildings, the property ol
Mr. Kennedy, together with the work'
and" improvements, which he has of late
been at a very great expence in erecting,
were entirely confrimeel. The fire pro
ceeded from thence (consuming in its way
two small franle9, the property of Mr.
Flickwir) to the printing-offices of Mr.
Thomas Dobfon, which were nearly de
stroyed, with printing materials to a large
amount. ' We cannot form a just calcula
tion of the whole 'ols, but, by the bell in
formation we can at present collect, sup
pose that Mr. Dobfon and Mr. Kennedy
together, are fuft'erers to the amount of ai
least 2DCOI.
" 'Tis with unpleafirg fenfatiom that we
add to this melancholy iketeh, the fate ol
a young man of this .city (Mr. Williarr
Cooper), near 2 1 years of ageâwho wa
killed by the parting of a fide wall of one
of the burning houses, while lending hi:
aid to quell .the conflagration. Two fine
children, eac,h about nine years of age
forhe time after the fire had been cxtiu
guilhed, were unfortunately buried, by a
limilar parting of the wall, in i f s ruins.
They were both found in a few minutes

northern extremities of the island, to Bel

arms, and flioiiM the French make a landing

the Roman Catholics and Presbyterians
would join them, so great is the abhorrence
of the people to corrupt measures of go

AT a time when the friends to liberty
throughout the whole world'are re
joicing in the success of the French revo
lution, it cannot be viewed with indiffer
ence that there are fume among us who
fee their success with anger, and rejoice
at all their misfortunes. If it was but a
small number they would be regarded only
with contempt ; but it cannot be concealed
that these are the sentiments of a confi
derabJe body in the United States, and
of not a few in this city. The cause of
this depravation, both of the moral and
political principle, is worthy of out atten
tion.
It appears at firit unaccountable, that
persons living under a free government,
who make the laws tlat govern them, and
choose those who Execute the laws, should
refufe these fame rights to another nation,
much more refpe&able ir. arts, commerce
and population, than that of which they
are a part. If this dislike to the change
in the French government was owing to a
prejudice in favour of the former one, we
should have at once the reason for their
opinion. But I have never yet seen any
man, who dared to insult the reason of
mankind so much, as to speak in favour
of the former French government. Tiie
politics of that court wsre the foundation
of all the wars that have desolated Europe
lor above 2CO years. The ambition of
.Louis XIV. coil France ten times more
lives than have been 101 l in the present
revolution. The people at that time had
no share in the government. It was the
king who made the laws ; and some idea
may be had of the fufferings of the people,
wheu I affeit, that from the days of Clovis
to Louis XVI. a space of 1300 years,
there was not one good king on the throne
of France ; not one who made the happi
ness of his people his lludy.âlf t* this
we Â»dd the power of a clergy, pofTeffiyg
one fifth part of the lands, and devoted
entirely to sensuality and indolence ; and
who granted pardons for all crimes, as they
praflifed them freely themselves.âThe
mod lively imagination cannot conceive a
greater combination of evils, ta a/HltSk
mankind.âAnd when this government,
through its own infufficiency, is over
thrown, and a great nation have made
themselves freeâto detelt their cause, and
wish success tb their enemies, can be the
cffedl of a bad heart only; or, to use the
words of a judicious writer, as applied to
one person, " his anger is not the emo
tion of a great and good mind : It is that
of Miltdn's fiend, contemplating the -in
nocence of our firfl parents, and the pofii
ble happiness of their race.''âA conlide
ration of the charadlers of those who are
opposed to the French revolution, will
oftentimes confirm this afiertion, In con
sidering this party, I will speak freely ;
Truth is fufficient for their enemies, and
exaggeration need not now be made use of
by the moll malignant. Mine is the cause
of liberty, and I am not afraid to avow
or fuppoit my opinions.
Though America was in general violent,
ly opposed* to Great-Britain in the lafl
war, yet there was a confider'able number
among us who espoused their cause, aflifted
them, and not a few who took up arms
agaiafl their countrymen. Many of these
men, after the war was finifhed, returned
among us. An ill-judged policy has lince
overlooked their behaviour, and some have
appeared in several offices of state. But
can it befuppofed that they have changed
"their principles? If they have not, are
they fit to rule freemen ? If they have, I
should flill be unwilling to trufl them.
There are converts in religion, but none
in politics. It hiay perhaps be urged in
their favour, that the knowledge of their
â own hearts has convinced them of the ne
cefiity of slavery, and a despotic power
is the one which is worthy of their am
bition ; for in that only, can they exercise
their favourite virtues. I accept the ex
"Cufe, and trace a connexion with their
whole condudl, After having attempted
to deflroy the liberties of their country,
it may easily be supposed that they are not
willing that others should be free Habit
alone would be fufficient; and the ill suc
cess of their faveurite Britain, which not
even her depredations on the Americans
can eompenfateâadds to their anger. Un
able to feel, or unwilling to confefs, the
generality which has signalized the French
nation flill more than their bravery, which
lias made them the terror of the armies
of Europe j t,hey dwell with peculiar plea-
Jure upon cxceffes, which fall far fhott ol
retribution. As if they could expect, that
injuries should be forgiven, because the
offended were at that time unable to re
Tent them ; or insults fuffered
without chaflifement.
A late addition has completed the edi
sice, consecrated to despotism, in which
pride and paflion are the high priefls, and
virtue and good sense the fa'crifices.
Ihe present obje& i 3 important. If
Americans can be taugkt to approve tlit
efforts of despotism, and despise the ftrug
g!es of liberty, they will f!>on be fit for
the yoke themselves. Exaggeration has
been frequently made use of, to raise the
pity of weak minds ; and in several instan
ces, the vanity of a man has been called
forth to harangue a croud, and to condes
cend to become the organ of mifreptefen
tation and calumny, whose pride will not
fuffer him to afiociate with his equals. But
the credit of the court, of which these men
are the true and loyal fubjedts, needs now
all their ingenuity for support. The ruin
of the British empire, by its immense
debt and the cofruption of its government,
was before inevitable ; by the ill policy of
their ministry, it is now accelerated. The
awful period rapidly approaches, and the
lall efforts of Britain are spent, not in en
deavouring to regain their former prospe
rity, but in attempting to drag another
nation, along with herfelf, to deflru&ion.
PHILADELPHIA.
A Correspondent, upon reading the
narratives of the various actions between
the armies of France and the combined
powers, cannot avoid making the reflec
tion, that man, where free, is equal toman
on every part or point of the globe. The
prejudice is now wearing off rapidly, that
one Englishman is equal to three French
in prowess; and we, in America, from
pa.pable demouftration" are convinced
of the fallhood of that assertion ; and are
rather inclined to believe that the present
cviancipated spirit of the French has ren
dered every individual of the nation at
leafl equal to any three of the slaves of
despotism from any part of Europe. From
those horrors of blood and death, dffplayed
on the stage of human action at the present
period, one would be inclined to aflc, Are
not mankind still in a state of political
childhood ; and might not the records of
the present and the pad ages of the world
be jultly denominated by a more enlight
ened posterity, " The HISTORY of the
BIG BOYS !" All this seeming puerility
of conduct, however, may be deduced from
that unnatural, predominant, form of go
vernment, called Monarchy. As long as
the bulk of mankind are content to look
upon any individual of their species as an
abfolllte, hereditary mafler, and hold their
lives ana'property at his disposal, so long
will they be bale and contemptible, and
liable to be let on, like blood-hounds, to
dellroy and massacre their fellow men, for
the benefit of a few, who, while noting in
luxury, and gluttonizing on the blood,Â°are
perhaps laughing at the miseries of their
ddilded/uijefls âAmerica! come the day,
when your benign example (hall convince
Europe, that all wars are merely the work
of jcfuitical policy, and that every na
tional queltion of dispute may be more
rationally as well as effectually decided by
the amicable method of pacific negocia
tion. We, of the present day, live at a
period when the strong holds of despotism
are breaking up ; when nations just begin
Jo discover that all human government
should be aclminiflered by the servants,
and not by the " ma/lers" of the people!
Let us improve upon the hint, and let
every individual be solicitous to contribute
his mite to the general emancipation of
his fpecics, at this very interelling period,
U U J\ ln the dawning of these mighty
times
