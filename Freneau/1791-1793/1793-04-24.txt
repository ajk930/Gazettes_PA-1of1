ON Sunday the ad of December 1 792,
til? volunteers of Lifburn went to the
prefbytei ian Meeting house ot that town.
\vhere an uccalitiiial was deliv
e.vtl :o tiieui by their excellent Pastor.
"1 he following extracts from the sermon
we think, will be accept b-e to our rea
tiers, on account their liberality, am
the found principles of liberty container
in them.
â¢ IF all power ami civil authority bt
derived from the PEOPLK, and if those
to whom it has been delegated, have gen
er.il y aba ed the sacred trull reposed ii
them, how hath it happened tliat the peo
ple ,ave been led to insert any individtia
rr body of men " itli such a degree of pou
ec, so liable to be thus abufetl. I beiievi
the moil probable answer to this queftioi
is. that the people, dreading the evils o
liieniioufnels, have tamely fubmitrcd tc
{he horrors ot despotism. Let us, theie
tore, briefly examine both, and compun
the o.ie w;th the isther. By liceiitiuiifuef
ii meant government oy a lawl. 1110b, ir
v apJlition to the will of the community
By despotism we are to understand gm era
uient by a tyrant, cjr a number ot tyrants .
tbu- it appears that they are nearly alii
ed to each other and are both i.ico ,!iftenl
with liberty, and the true end of govern
went. In avoiding one of thole evils
mankind have often run into the other
but all well conllituted governments guari
equally against both.
â¢â¢ It has been usual in pall ages, and 1
not uncommon at this day, to dticribe tht
evils of iiceatioufnefs by every epilhe;
which is calculated to rouse dread anc
honor in the breall ot man; while at tht
lame t me, the evils of despotism are pas
fed over urmotftfeS, <ffi H fpoke'i of, de
fciibed in terms very much refemblingth<
lan mage of to iplailaiue. The tonfe
nuence is, th it the people are in danger o:
led to prefer despotism, to the teni
uorary irregularity of the p< ople. called 1!
centioufnefa. If such sentiments had bet 1
confined to men of fl villi principles, tin
enemies to tile liberty of mankind, I ihouU
rot have noticed them in this difiourfe
but such sentiments have been adopted
aud recommended to our atte nio , nuclei
the fanftion of names truly dignified, am
highly refpe table. If liceiitiouliiel's hat!
dellroyed its thoufa ds, despotism has de
ltroyed its millions, and, therefore, \> hie
of the two is the moll to be dreaded ?
Licentiousness, having nothing to sup
port it but the tumultuous efforts of ;
1110b, isoffhort duration, and soon find:
its own remedy. Despotism proceeds u
ait under all the function and authority
and islupporttd by ail the power and re
sources d; eltabiiiiied government.
â¢â¢ Much uutihief 11111 ft be effected before
it cab" clearly perceived, and Â« hen oiui

GAZETTE.
S I R,
THE government of Great-Britain have
offered as a pretext for a war againll
France,the opening of the Scheldt, belong
ing to their allies the Dutch, which the)
guaranteed to them by treaty. To fulfi
their engagements with their alfies, they
are about to expend the treasure and the
blood of the nation ; and that without ha
ving value received or being called upor
for this fulfillment. It is not my intentior
to offer any remarks upon this plea for
going to war; I mean only to contrail this
conduct with the conduct of Ainer cans to
wards their allies the French. At the time
that France admitted us an ally and ac
knowledged our independence,(lie hazardec
a great deal, as we were incapable of af
for ling her much aid, from the then criti
cal and alarming lituation of our affairs
The clouds of misfortune had been gather
ing thick around us, and but oneÂ°ray ol
prosperity Ihot through the gloom, the cap
ture of Burgoyne. Unpromising as were
appearances, France not only rendered u:
pecuniary aili.lance, but her armies and hei
fleets were directed to protect us. Thro
their aid the career of a inercilefs few wa
checkedât!iro* their aid our fovereignt)
was eitatiliihed and our liberties fecmed.
In turning my eyes towards the late Revo
lution. to take a palling view of the im
me.ife lervice which we derived from oui
gallic connection, I (hall forbear taking
into view the inhuman tranl'acbons of Bri
tons; the blood of our slaughtered citizens,
hundreds of whom were fuffered to expire
in a land of plenty, without even being al
lowed â¢â¢ the rrumbs which fell trom the
rich man's table," mingles in my foul Inch
fenfatio is of horror and resentment, that I
with to tl/ from so <lire a picture. Altho'
every American who felt an intereff in the
prosperity of his country, and the welfare
of thole deflined to promote it, inuft fee
an abhorrence for that government which
caused us so many miieriesâl mean not tc
avail myfelf of their resentment, b:it ol
their grateful feelings towards a nation,
without whose affiltance we Ihould at pre
sent be groaning under a Britilh yoke.â
The principles of liberty, which the war
riors of France alfilled us to maintain,
ftrtick deep in their minds ; they had nevei
tailed, nay they had never seen the
freedom before, and they longed to mmglt
their draughts with men who drank of fuel:
happiness. This, combined with other
circumltances, communicated the ardour
which has since produced such important
consequences. America may be said to bt
the immediate parent of French liberty,
and yet we are about playing the Itep dame
with her For removiug the greatell and
perhaps the only remaining obilacle to their
freedom, we censure them without mea
sure and condemn them without mercy.
Had George the 3d been in our power du
ring the war, when our minds had beei
heated by the calamities which he had oc
calioncd, would his lite have been fecu. e ?
To use the bathos of Burke, ten thoufind
swords would have leaped from their fcab
b.irds to put an end to the moiiler.â
France has unlheathed the sword of justice.
and with it has smote a criminal who ha<
conspired againll a government which he
had sworn to maintain ; the magnitude oj
the criminal, and not the magnitude of hi:
crimes affeils us, contrary to every fenle
of justice which ought to proportion the
punilhment to the power and importance
of the offender, and the extent of his
crimes, without a view to his wearing a
crown or a cowl. For doing this, for un
dertaking to judge of her own interests, tc
judge her own criminals, and pronouncc
and execute sentence upon them, we turn
from them with indignation and horror.
So far are we from observing the conduct
of even Great-Britain towards her ally,
that we make a war of abuse upon ours,
instead of giving her every support and
countenance in our power. 1 his is so far
from meeting unto her as (lie meeted unto
us, that like the viper in the fable, we
fling the bosom which cherilhed and Cur
tained us. The Duke of Brimfwick's ma
nifedoes are not replete with more hofii
lity than forne of our public prints ; his en
terprizes, if they can be called such, did
not manifeft great> r enmity to republican
ism, than the bittemejs offome characters
among us, who seem to have combined
their cause with despotsâShould France
succeed, equality will triumph, and the
head of the serpent of arillocracy and mon
archy will be crufiied foreverâfliould (he
inifcarry, (which may Heaven avert !) it
will add new vigour to the efforts of the
noble few of our c ountry, and the death ol
republicanism there, will be the resurrec
tion of inequality in the United States.
April 22, 1793. WARREN.
To the Freemen of Philadelphia.
Fellow-Citizens,
A N opportunity will soon offer itfelf, not
oily to Iheiv our republicanism but to
maiiifeit tile degree of gratitude Â»e feel for
o:ir t reilch allies, and tile interelt we take
in their conflicts lor the rights of humani
tyâ 1 hope lam wrong i.i the observation,
that our attachment to the canfe of France
lias been ebbing ever lince her enemies
hue iiicreal'ed, and her profpedts have be
come mure darkâPerhaps our Ultercourfe
with Great Britain may have jaundiced
our eyes, and her inlu)ioiiscondu(:t,and the
torrent* of calumny poured from her pres
ses, and which seem to be echoed with
malignant plealure, may have given impref
lions by some creatures among us, unfa
vourable to French liberty; howei er this
may be, it by 110 means argues in favour
of our national character, or our princi
ples, to fufter a diminution of our interefl
in the politics of our illuftriousally. The
time is at hand that iliall decide whether
we have merited the exertions which
were in-ide to refine us from tyranny, and
whether we are worthy the blefiings of
freedomâMr. Genet, a diitinguifhcd
French patriot,and from the re
public is daily expected here from Clmrlef
tonâOur conduit on his arrival will c\ i
de.ice our sentiments of the cause of whicl;
he is an agent âPreparations, I am told,
have been made to welcome liini with the
firing of cannon and other demonltration:
of joy ; but have been prohibited by i
determination of the headi of Join e of out
departmentsâA Jpeciotts reafoil has beei
given for this, that "theprefent ambafla
dor was not received in this way, and ii
would be making an improper diltinflion.'
A change of circumltances requires a
change of conduit ; but as we are well
acquainted with the principles of some ol
the gentlemen at the head ot our affairs wt
need not be surprized at such a determina
tion; for France is not only waging wai
against the defpotilin of monarchy, bu
agaiiift the dejputijm of arijlocracy, and ii
would appear rather uncommon to fee

EXTRACTS.
[Fro>Â« a Southern Paper]
r. There is a certain party in this coun
ty more or less busy in every place in en-
Jeavouring to excite a spirit of national
ympathy and compassion for themelnncho
y fate of the late king ofFraiue&h.s fami
ly, to awaken otir gratitude by a remem
arance of former services, and to place the
lew constitution of France and the an -
:hors of the revolution, in the molt odious
md contemptible view, by ridiculing the
3ne and calumniating the other. To el
ect these purposes, attention to argument,
â ruth and candour, has been disregarded.
\ mangled, disjointed account has. been
leld up toour view,lhewingthe popular pjr
:y in France has alone been guilty ot ex
cefles. While the mild, pure character of
the king has been exhibited to our view in
all the firong colourings, that arr'ent ima
ginations could suggest or fophiflry iilvent;
and Americans are called upon to come
lorward to save the man, (who, if we . re
to believe these fanciful writers,) in the
benevolence of his heart, ftreuhed In
mighty arm across the great Atlantic, and
ileli \ ered us from the chains of tyranny.
2. Many, if not all the popular excefles
in France have been unavoidable, from the
nature of circumltances : and yet no series
of events in hiftorv have been more mali
ciously, malignantly, and fyfiematically
exaggerated than the French commoti
ons. All enraged, numerous, and opulent
body of exiles dispersed over Europeâha
ving. poflefled themselves of every venal
press, filled the public ear with a detail of
crimes never committed, and their confe
derates in America have echoed back the
fame polluted strains. Many excefles and
miseries have no dcubt been committed, at
which humanity revoltsâbut such will
ever be the cafe witli all revolutions, which,
!.ke that of France, is Itrictly popular.â
When a general movement of the populai
mind, levels defpotifni with'the ground,
there is revenue to satiate without autho
rity ro cuntruui- Paliio.is by which fucli
effects are produced, are too violent to fub
lide in a moment into fertility and iubmif
iion ; and in the inti-râ 'uT w li.cli elapses be
lore .1 cnl;u fuccet els the boifterotis mo
ments c>i a revolution, it 1., in vain to ex
pect, that a people who have ages of op
preifion to avenge, will be pi::icti!i:;i.tij
generous in tile moment of triumph, like
ly discriminative i:i their vengeance, or
cautiously r,:i!el in the mode of ittal ati< n.
3 Popular exttflis have always au
alarming operation on the mind. The
wild jullice of the people has an undifgui
feel horror in itâits fmallei't movements
excite ine i,nation, while the maA'acio
of war, when functioned by king*, are dif
gnifecl by the solemnities which mvelt their,
and minder and rapine, if clothed with
state authority, ftaik abroad with impuni
ty, and we forget that the evils of anarchy
are fliort lived, while those of despot.c go
vernment are ofpermanent duration.â In
dependent of theft? circuinlhi; ces, as they
apply to revolution* i.i general, a candid
and ferions invelligation of the rife and
progress cf the French revolution, will
/hew that to it they are peculiarly applica
ble.
4- The private chaTafter of monarchs it
generally viewed through tile fplencicr oi
a court, but it is not to our purpose lo in
vestigate the private character of the lcinp
of France; it may have been as amiable
as reprefentcdâ His public condnttis tht
fnbject of enquiry. We are told cf hi;
extreme moderation, and of certain enn
ceffions in favor of tile peopleâAdmittin j
these afl'ei tions to be itriitiy true, (whiclr
by the way, they are not) it may be re
marked, that moderation is no great vir
tue. when men have affunied evtiy thing.
Ctef.ir, when he had subverted the libertie:
of his country, made fonie voluntary con
cellions in favour of her liberty, as if tc
convince her citizens th.it they owed eve
ry thing to his bountyâit can oniy be to i
li tiered as an aggravation of calamities he
had brough. upon his country.
5- One important truth is either igno
rantly or delignedly overlooked by tile
enemies of the French revolution which i>.
that it was not a revolution againlt Louis i (
but againlt the arbitrary principles ot tlu
government-It has bet-n aflerted til it the
l ite king, voluntarily called the llates-ge
neral, and from the manner in which it i
mentioned, it would appear to have flow
ed from a conviction in the king, that tliej
neceflary for the liberty of the pro
pie. The fact is, that the king, involved
in difficulties from the firmoefs of the Par
liament, and the ten icioufiiefs of tiie No
tables; but above all, from a total derail",?-
ment of fnv-inces, by the advice of Mr.
Neckar, the Hates general were called.â
V\eare now corns to a pctiid w hen ll
will be neceflary to observe the conduci
nf the court and the popular party, wher
we fliall discover that the popular excel'
fes have not been unprovoked.âWe (hall
now discover the neceflity of the meaftire;
which were adopted by the popular party ;
for when one party resorts to violence ir
order to ftipport its opinions, the othei
mult resort to the fine mean:âand w'icr
reason isfupported by the sword.the (Irong
eft mult prevail.âNo sooner did the 'late
general aflemble, than th"y difcoverec
lentiments of freedom, that the court toe
late endeavoured to fiipprefs, ti:o' it wa:
not without exeition, that it failed. O:
t.ie 20th of June 1789, when the Common:
would have met, they found the Hail
w here their meetings had beforebeen held
filled with armed soldiers, and themlelvc:
expelled by the point of the bayonet.â
1 lie temple of liberty was prephaned bi
the myrmidons of despotism I âOn the 2
ot June in the lame year, the memorable
royal felHons was Ik Id. The speech of tht
king on that occasion un/oided his arbitra
ry principles.âThi; speech instead of con
tainirgany conceflion, i:i favour of liberty
indicated a relapse into a inore le-fry eltf
potifm than had before ma keel his c onehict.
Mean while, legions of foreign mercena
ry troops were drawn from'the dillanl
provinces to crufii this infant ipirit of liber
ty-â Ihe patriots flew to arms ; the event:
and iffiie of the contelt are well know.
The ignominious flight of the enemies <>l
freedom, and the king's acct ptanee i t tht
conflitiition rellored tranquility. T1 e re
putation which the king had fufminc d lor
probity, fecurtd him tiie confidence of the
nation, and as much tranquility existed,
is could beexpectcd after fueli a nighty
evolution. Ihe intrigues of the e"mi
jrants gave serious concern to the friend!
jf freedom, and altho' among them were
nany of the king's nearest relations, he
was loved and unfiifpefted until his flight.
From that moment a gloomy fufpiclon
leized the minds of menâHis lincerity
was suspected, and not without causeâ
one event followed another, until the
king was fulpended from his fnnÂ£Vion?.
The succeeding tranfaflions are lerent in
the minds of all, the fccne of wonderflii
events has been doled with the condemna
tion and execution of the king. It is im
pnffible to form a just idea of "the motives
which may have influenced a majority ci

iieged Maeflricht,and Gen Damourier was
on his march to take pcflellion of Amster
dam, where it was expected he would
be joyfuily received by a majority of the
inhabitants.
It is mentioned in letters from Europe,
thata very great part ol' Gen-Dumoufier's

" The people of Courland in Prussia.
(faysan Engliih paper), have taken aim l
and drove the duke ot Mittau from the ca
pital ; on his retreat they declared them
selves free. Thirty of his guards were
killed in the attempt to defend the palace,
and the deferring sons of libei ty were tri
umphant.âThe news of this bold and fuc-
enterprizehas so alarmed our gov
ernment, as to occasion the immediate lup
preffion ofnilmberlefs clubs, that have been
formed throughout Prussia. This ft retch
of authority, it is thought, will rather ani
mate than suppress the discontented.
The general council of war have de
clared to the king, that it will be both im
politic, and dangerous to withdraw the
troops from Berlin, Stetin, Koninglberg,
and Silesia, while tie minds of a large ma
jority of the people are in a state Of revo

We are authorized to fay, that the re
port ot Lord Dorchester coming to the
United States as Afnbaflador from the Bri
tilh court, is without foundation.âAn ac
count was circulated some timeiiuce, that
that nobleman had been re-appointed to
the government of Canada, and that he
was to land at New-York. on his way to
Quebec : from which, it is fnppdfed, the
above report mult have taken rife.

'â¢ Many and various (fays a paper of
vcfterday) are the observations and con
jectures, res >efling the part which this
country will take in the present war. It
seems, however, pretty clear, that there is
no treaty now exilling, which binds .i.mc
ricato afliftthe trench, in any cafe what
ever. If this be true, it will undoubtedly
be for the interest of this country,, to ob
serve the ftrittell neutrality, Ifuett : Can
â -ye not, perfectly confident with this prin
:iple. receive into our ports, the prizes of
parties, without partially aiding cr as-
Ifting t ither ?
.Spuie p*r o.is have fuggefteel the 'idea of
i) ivateer b.-in .fittedoi t&owred in Ame
rica. This wou id undoubtedly be produc
tive of the mod dangerous consequences.
It would immediately draw upon us the
vfentment of Great-Britain, andeventu
lly involve the country in a war, which
iotw i til Handing the allertions of some bra -
vados, in the present ungnirded situation

ruinous consequences."
The French appear not to beat war with
the Spaniards. Indeed, the marine o1
France, is the only rational security the
Spaniards can have for the dependence of
~>outh America on them ; and of this truth
they mud be fatisfied by a single moment';
reflection : for a war against the Spaniards
was barely prevented by the interference
of the French National Aflembly but tw c
years ago in favor of Spain, and the de
ligns of the Britilh cabinetagainft that ;jart
id the Spanish dominions, was then a point
of notoriety every where. We can farce
Iv suppose then, how everdifagreeable font
of the late proceedings of the French iftav
Have been to the Spaniards, that they will
violate the firrt principles of national po
licy, by tiding with their natural enemy
igainll their ancient friends. If Spain,
therefore, Ihould not interpose in the quar
rel, and the Dutch are attacked in the vi
tal-. of their power by a direit invalion ol
their country, the Britilh will be very like
!y ! o: to profit much by their absurd ant;
impolitic refentnient, which they have fc
freely expressed against the French, anc
by their hoitile preparations.âFor if tlieii
ivlources are compai'ed, the French have
the utmost advantage.âas these last have
in immense territory, which they can dis
pose of to the amount, it is laid, of at leal
ine hundred and thirty millions sterlingâ
while the Britilh mull depend on taxe:
done to support their operationsâthe
French have acted withfpirit in anticipat
ing the meditated blow of the Britilh na
tion against them, and thus far profitin;
by their own experience in a limilar situa
tion.âThe Britilh king complains indeet
with ill grace 011 tiiis point.âas it is wei
known in the war before last. eight thou -
sand French feameri were captured by the
Britilh, before a declaration had taker
placeâAnd in the last war St. Etiftatius
was takenfrom the Dutch without the leaf!
regard to this national formality.

The last will and testament of the king
of France, re-publilhed in this and molt
other American prints, from English and
Porttiguefe papers, is thought by many to
be a forgery of some Spanish or Portu
guefemonkâThe story of the execution ot
of the late queen of France seems to be
wholly without foundation.
By a letter from England, from an Ame
rican merchant there, a report is comma
nicated that the Dutch patriots had olier
ed a loan of ten millions fteriing to the re
public of France* the moment their troops
Ihould enter, and takepofleffion of the fc

them from the tyranny of the Orange, or

Immense failures have recently taken
place in the city of London, and public
credit was on the 20th of February, in a
moll perilous and tottering lituation.'*
7 hcfe things are so well known (fays a
London paper.) that public credit cannot
poflibly fuller by the full publication of the
tail." At the above date four great hou-
IVs in London had (topped payment. They
were principally engaged in American and;
\\ eft-India brokerage and insurance con
cerns. O.ie house alone had tailed for
3oo,oool.fteriing, and anotherforsoo,oool.
J lie failures then known were cltimated
it three millions; and, it was computed
â¢vould extend to two millions more.â
The king of England had ili'ued a pro
lamation making all sailors liable to luffer
leath who should be found fer\ing on
'Â°ard French vefielsof war. The French

engagement with the Prussians, before

WHEN France broke its fetters an!
brought the tyrant's head undet
the sword of jullice, (lie well knew that
furroundiug despots, would tinie their cf
foits againd her, and affilt in the cauft.
of the enemies of equality, but the oath
to use every effort and employ all the in
vincible energy of republican courage, and,
ifneceffary, die, in the defcnce of thofc
principles had univerfallv been taken. â
What was forefeen is now veiified; Rufiia.
England, Holland and perhaps Spain,
armed againll us, intend to try upon tlu
water and in ports at a dillance from tlu
mother republic, whether the soldiers ol
equality will be able every where to fight
and conquer. The empire, the king o
Sardinia, the king of Bohemia and Hun
g ry, the king of Pruflia unite to protctl
and revenge the cause of tyranny, tc
wrest from lis the fruit of our labour an '
jminenfe efforts. The French in the new
world, as well as their European brethren
will teach their enemies, that a resellers
ted people are not iinpun ly to be attack
ed, and that the slaves of despotism mull
fly before the soldiers of equality.
We confide in your patriotism to adop
the wisest and mod prompt mealures. â
Your firll care fhou d be to revisit th<
forts, arsenals, magazines, to examine anc
put in operation all the means of cefenct
â which the colony can oppose to its en.
mics, and to provide the island, before
hand, with all it will require in the courfi
of an obitinate war.
It is of the firll importance to kee[
the intercourse between the United S ate:
and the Colony free, a 6 it has been hitler
to, to dr w thence the precious afliltanci
they afford.
The frigate L'Embufcadc, on board ol
which the new ambassador to the Unitec
States is to embark, is to cruise in tholf
latitudes and then unite under the flag ol
reir admiral Gambis. It is to that (jf
ficer that the provisional executive cotin
cil have, for the present, entrusted the
command of the naval forces, to which
llation they had firft appointed rear ad
miral Morard Degall, who however is nc
longer ceftintd for that command.
Citizen Genet, charge del affaire* from
France to the United States, will attend
to furnifhing St. Domingo with provili
ons ; a talk which the republic cannot
undertake under the present circumllan
ces, which require the exe tionof all hei
resources for her f a and land forces:
the republic however will ufc every effort
to transmit to you, within two months, e
considerable quantity cf provisions of al
kinds, and those articles which a (late oi
war will rendei necessary.
The naval f rces Â» hich the provifiona
executive council intends for St. Domin
go will be composed of the fl ips Le Ju
piter and L Amtrtque, the frigates L
Slfire la Belionnc, k L'Emlufcade, ihe ten
tier la Prompte, the flute le Marjouin, anci
a few advice-boats.
It will be especially necessary to takf
the fafeft meaiurcs to protcdl the rettirr
to France oft estate Vessels, which rear
admiral Gambit is dite&rd to ftnd to Eu
rope. It would be dangerous to retarc
th failing of any i f these vessels.
The failure of any one to do wh t is
tlire&ed by the executive council, might
niar important projt&s, and the executi
on of plana adopted. The refpeQablt
forccs intended for the station of St Do
mingo should do away eveiy apprehension,
and you may rell assured that every pof
fible additional nava ! assistance will be sent.
See that no merchantmen leave the co
lony without the fafeft precautir ns, with
out your leive and such convoy as will
make them refpefted.
The provilional executive council re
commends to you all local meafurcs which
your prudence or the course of events may
dilate. Inspire the colonies w th the p in
ciples you have fworu to support ; per
fuade tl em, that unlefa they are united,
and faithfully attached to the mother
country their property and fortune are in
secure ; that on her profperi.y theirs de
pends, and that the means of refloring to
the colonies their former splendor, and to
their commerce itsaÂ£livity, is to conquer,
to fti ike terror into the hearts of their in
ternal enemies, the only enemies, we have
row to combat. Let us fliew what
Frenchmen, freed from the chains of del-
potifm, can do. We shall be happy and
vi&oiious as long as wc are united,

ExtraS of a Idler from a gentleman in Lon
don, to his friend in the United Stales.
" The present is an eventful crilis ; all
Europe is in a ferment, and the great Itrug
gle is, the overthrow or tie eflablifhmenl of
LibertyâOn this occaGon, as a man a?
a friend to the happiness of the human
race, I cannot suppress the anxious sensa
tions which incessantly agitate mybofom â
Although an Englifliman by birth, I fttrl
myfelt a citizen ot the worldâOh ! my
friend 1 may the United States of Ame
rica continue to be an afjltim to the op
pressed ! But why (hou'd I give place to
a doubt ? It is fondly hoped by some 011
this fide the water, "hat you are insensibly
verging to a MONARCHICAL confti
tution ; they argue, th it a predilection
for this form of government ft ill exills a
mong you. It is further said, that your
senate is entirely under influence ; and that
the doors of that house are forever (hut a
gainst the people :âWith us, even the
house of lords is open to pubhc curiosity.
Far be it from me to derogate any thing
from your worthy repiefentatives : But if
this inquifitoriaJ prerogative should ever
fall into bad hands, they may enter into
treaties, form idliancts, and even fell the
whole country to some powerful nation.
What Â» ould your btavery avail, when your
confidence had, from time to time,received
fleets and armies, under (ham pretences,
into the bosom of your country, when
your mgazines and llrong holds were in
their power? These are naked hintsâ
wiser heads than mine may obviate all dif
ficulties. Before this reaches you, I flip
pose you will be appr zed of the appoint
ment of an arr.baflador to your court âSii
Guy Carleton is the personage spoken of.
Great Britain withes to fafhion you to bet
views ; and, therefore, relaxes her severity,
and fends a public and popular character
among you. But remember the French !
They fought for youâthey bled for you,
and they now fuffer, because they have da
ted to imitate your noble example. Surely
no -ran in America will be so much daz
7,led by the cursed lustre of (tars and gar
ters, of toys and trinkets, as to w thhold
his hearty echo o , Long live the gloti
ous Revolution and the Independence oi
France 1"
EXTRACT.
" The Americans are charged with 2
want of gratitude towards their great bene
filÃc.r to whom, if we are to credit fomt
men's affeitions, we owe all o ir happiness
and prosperity.â I am not o-e of thof<
who would undervalue the services o
France, by supposing (he was herfclf fuf
ficiently advantaged ; though fiich has al
ways been the language of a certain set
who now fdy the Americans want grati
tude. But I trust we do not want grati
tude to our friends and benefaÂ£lors. In a
deipotic Hate, the monarch is the nation :
the nation is figuratively concentered it
him. It was the French nation who aided
us in our ardent struggle for liberty, auc
to the French nation is our gratitude ow
ing. A nation in the full enjoyment ol
liberty, cannot be indifferent to the drug
gies of another to attain it. Much lei;
then can Americans remain indifferent tc
the efforts of the French nation to obtain
freedom ; independent of that fraternal
concern which free nations feel for each
other, Amerca, by the additional tie of
gratitude, feels for France, and if we had
not 101 l a part of that fpir.'t- which once
animated us, our gratitude would not be
confined to empty profeffions or fellive ex
ultations.âAmericans who yet retain the
character of republicans, will join me in
offering up the most fervent prayeis for an
issue of the contell favourable to the cause
of freedomâNor ought we to reft too
confident from our local situation. 'I he
contell is not a contall of nations, it is a
contell of political prin iplcs ; and fnould
despotism prevail, our situation may be
come critical. The purity and excellet ce
of our government is painful in the fight
of tyrants, because it furniflies an example
of the happiness of equal liberty. Distant
nations may sigh for a participation of the
blcflings of freedom ; and sighs may gene
rate something more exprefiive On the
north we have a nation, of whose enmity
a ten years' peace has made no abatement,
and whose government has many years
back, been aiming at an abridgement o(
the liberty of her citizens. Oil the foMh
we have a nation, the principles ol whose
government arc so truly despotic, that the
found of liberty is not heaidâln our
own country we have enemies more dan
gerous : Men who are diffatisficd with the
pure (implicit)' of republican government.
Men, whole virtues and t;.l nts cannot ex
alt them above the level of their fellow
citizens. but wilh to have the aid and con
ti ivances-of monarchy. Of such men, my
countrymen, let us beware, ftilpedl thele
satellites of monarchy and aristocracyâ
Snfpicion, the so lilt ft trait in private life,
is the most lovely feature of public cha
rafter."
