For the NATIONAL GAZETTE.
On the originating Revenue Bills by the
Secretary.
IT is the policy of the Supreme Magis
trate of mod governments to fhieldhim
elf from the effects of popular discontent
ind odium, by rendering the great Minif
:ers of State responsible for the adminiftra
ion of public affairs, so that, whether the
lifafters or evils complained of originated
n mifcondufl or misfortune, the ministers
ire made to bear all the blame.
Thus, in mod countries, whenever occa
sion requires, is the character and interests
jf the minister facrificed in order to screen
:he supreme executive, whose creature he
;s; but it has been reserved for the United
States to extend this policy to the Legisla
ture of the union, to th; total fubveriion of
that responsibility in the representatives of
the people, which is the great, the efficient
security for the due exercise of the all-im
portant trust committed to their charge ;
and is, in short, the<vita\ principle of a re
publican form ofjgovernment.
Having formerly remarked upon this con
duct as it refpefted the military operations,
I shall now proceed to offer some observa
tions 011 the fifcal arrangements.
That the funding system has appreciated
the price of certificates and advanced our
credit, is acknowledged by all, but that the
public mind is soured against that system
and that its operation has had very disa
greeable effects on society, and occasioned
distress to individuals, cannot be denied;
âit has certainly brought about a revolu
tion of habits and interests, and made a
change in the relative situation and pur
suits of society ; a new state of things ap
pears, and a mixture of consternation and
chagrin prevail?.
1 hose who have benefited by this system,
by being better informed, or more fortu
nate than their neighbors, applaud the Se
cretary of the Treasury, as if he had crea
ted their prosperity; and those who have
been overreached, or who regret the pre
vailing abuses, load the minister with the
blame of all they think pernicious.
I will firft enquire how far the Secretary,
from the nature of his office, ought to be
the object of praise or blame.âThefuper
intendance of all the subordinate
the revenue, the prompt application of
revenue to the uses for which it was appro
priated, and to give information on these
iubjefts to the President, or to either House
of the when dire&ed so to do,
are doubtless the duties of the firft officer
of the revenue department.
If he attends to thel'e duties with dili
gence and ability, he will merit recom
mendationâand if he neglects his duty, or
deceives government with falfe informa
tion, he is censurable. That duties of a
higher order and more influential nature
have been required from the Secretary of
the Trealury respecting our fifcal arrange
ments, is well underlloodâand much com
plained of.
The power of originating revenue sys
tems cau only be fafely velUd with, and

oercercifed by that branch of the government,
which partakes most largely of the interest
of the people, and which by residence and
numbers are belt acquainted with the cir
cumstances of all the parts.
To this principle the conftitut'on of the
general government, as well as these of
the particular states, pays the most scrupu
lous attention ; even those states whose
least numerous branch of the legislature
poflefs the fame qualifications, and are cho
sen by the fameeleftors as the most numer
ous branch, are not permitted to prepare
money bills, because front the.fmallnels of
their numbers they Save riot fufficient
knowledge of the varied local interests, or
feelings of the people ; nor are not by fueh
frequent elections made refponlible to
them. The House of Lordsin Britain can
neither originate nor amend a money bill;
the Senate of Congress, and of this state,
can alter and amend, but not originate.
That propounding resolutions or origi
nating bills, is an exercise of legislative au
thority, and carries along with it an impor
tant influence, is the opinion of all writers
on the fubjeft ; I will only mention
De Lolme.
" Indeed I confefs it seems very natural
in the modeling of a state to intrult this im
portant office of framing laws to those per
sons who may be supposed to have before
acquired experience and wisdom in the ma
nagement of public affairs, but events have
unfortunately demonstrated, that public
employments and power improve the un
derstanding of men in a less degree than
they pervert their views ; and it has beer
found in the iii'ue, that the effect of a regu
lation which, at firft fight, seems foperfeft
ly consonant with prudcn.ce, is to con
fine the people to a meer paliive and defen
five share in legillation, and deliver them up
to the continual enterprises of those who,
at the fame time, that they are under the
greatest temptations to deceive them, pos
sess the most powerful means of elfefting it."
The prelent funding system in all its
branches, and the revenue laws by which it
isfupported, was prepared by the Secretary
of the Treasury, in consequence of refer
ences made to him by the House of Repre
sentativesâThis was an exercise of power
peculiar to that House, which could not be
delegated, nor even to any other branch of
the government.
The power of legislating resides only in
those chosen specially for that purpose, and
can only be exercised according to the
modes and reltriftions prescribed in the con
stitution. Toufurp legislative authority,
partakes of the nature of treason ; aud if
thole whÂ» are legally vested with that au
thority transfer it to others, it is at least a
breach of trust. If it can be transferred ill
one degree, why not to all its extent ? ,
If the constitution and the nature of go
vernment will not permit the senate chosen
by the people in their state aflemblies, or
the Prelident chosen by the people through
their electors, both of them responsible, and
in a degree permanent, to exercise this
power, how improper is it to transfer that
important and most influential trust of ori
ginating revenue systems to an executive
officer, appointed during the pleasure of the
Prelident for the time, and dependent upon
his conditional negative for the continuance
of his salary.
This practice, introduced by the last Con
gress, and continued in the present, is to
make a special reference to the minister,
requesting him to prepare a system and re
port against their next felfion, or sooner, as
the cafe may be âThe House does not even
fix the outlines of the plan, they do not pre
scribe from what sources a revenue lha!l be
drawn, nor sometimes the extent to which
it lhall be applied. While it lays with the
Secretary, the members, probably, pay 110
more attention to it than if they were not
concerned ; indeed they neither have the
means of knowing the fubjeft, nor investi
gating the principles with which it is invol
ved, therefore they are no more prepared
to discuss the business when it is reported,
than when it was referred. However, this
deleft is also fuppiled ; for the Secretary is
obliging enough to furnifh them with well
digested and studiously ingenious arguments
in support of the system he has prepared.
There is much goodness and propriety in
this; goodness, because it does not appear
to be among the duties required in his ap
pointment, or called for when the reference
js made to him ; and propriety, because the
business not being digelted by them, nor
prepared publicly, but in the Secretary's
closet, the members cannot be poffefled of
arguments of their own on the fubjeft.
Certainly, if the House of Representatives
originated their own bulinefs in a commit
tee of the whole, the knowledge of the bu
siness would arise out of the investigation,
and principles and arguments would luggefi
themselves trom the nature of the cafe ; or
if it was firft examiued in a numerous and
impartially chosen special committee, one
resolution would combat another, and if
the committee did not agree, the minority
of the committee would be as well prepa
red to explain the business on the floor as
the majority; in this way they would have
the advantage of two setts of arguments on
tie floor ; it is true, some of the arguments
might be laboured and seemingly inconsist
ent, and the facts a little discoloured, and
will any one fay that the Secretary's argu
ments have not been sometimes tin&ured
with these defects, or if they have not, that
another Secretary's may not ? I observe
the Secretary's arguments are quoted
authoritiesâPerhaps in some time they may
be bound in volumes and coniidered a;
standard authorities in revenue cafe?. We
have common law and chancery reporters,
why not have fifcal reporters also?
The Secretary ought to give information
refpefting the tranfaftions in the depart
ment which he superintends: if there is an)
defect in the laws refpe&ing it, the Preli
dent has a right to recommend it to the at
tention of Congress, either by a report 01
the Secretary, who is an executive officer
or otherwaysâbut the President himfeli
has no right to fix principles, to fay whal
property or occupation Ihall be taxed, whal
go free, and what receive encouragement
nor what part of the public debt (hall be
funded, and what part of the public deb.
(hall be fubjeft to fix per cent, what three
and what deferred. If it be said that the
House of Representatives may alter, a
mend, or reject the systems which he origi
nates, it is granted, and Co may the Senate
alter, amend, or re : eft a bill originated b)
th? otherHoufeâThe peculiar prerogative
of the numerous branch is to give the sirs
lorm to revenue bills, and this gives it ar
influence of no small importance ; but the
House of Representatives cannot fuppori
their fyltem before the Senate by tranfmit
ring along with it volumes of arguments
nor can they Ihut their doors and prepare i
in secret : In fliort, by this new method o:
legislating, the power of a negative, whicl
each branch has over the other, is not ye
transferred to the Secretary, but in ever)
other refpeft he exercises the most influen
tial part of fifcal legislation.
However, in defence of this minifteria
influence, it is not only privately Tuggelte'd
but openly argued on the floor ; that the
members are not capable of originating re
venue systems ; that their constituents ne
ver designed them for that purpose, noi
coniidered them as financiers: that altho
they are capable to judge of them wher
they are prepared or to alter, amend, o;
reject them, yet not to plan them : That ;
man may judge of a good picture or piece
of mechanism, who is not a painter or me
chanic. The sophistry of this illuitratioi
is too apparent to elcape dete&ion. A.
man cannot take the pencil and alter o
amend a picture, nor reject it and make one
in its place, who is not a painter : Nor cai
a man alter the principle, or supply anc
change thepapts of a machine who is not Â£
mechanic : indeed if the argument prove:
any thing, it proves too much, for it goe:
to prove that the members can neither ori
ginate, alter, nor change the-fyftem,- anc
leaves them barely the power of approving
or rejecting. If this is true, we are noi
qualified for a republican form of govern
ment ; if so, it is much better to change sot
one more finjple, while we have the powei
of forming it, than to Aide unawares into Â£
practical despotism, while we are keeping
up republican appearances. SIDNEY.

till thould even reach the upper house, the part
vhich relates to the praflice of the law will be
oft there, and which is the only one of the four

iccurtomed to plentiful tables, do not per
iap:i know it, it is nevertheless a melancho

ExtraS of a Utter from We/l-Jerfey, Jpril 6.
" I received duly, the book you for
warded to me, entitled, The Travels of
Captain Farrago. It puzzled me not a lit
:le 011 reading the work through, how,
n conscience, the author could, in his pre*
"ace, recommend it as a proper book for
chool-children, or for young clergymen,
?fpecially in such parts as the firft chapter
of the third bookâwhat information could
children receive from the vulgar Irilh-cifras
in the latter end of the second chaptcr of
:he fame bookâls it requisite to initiate
young minds in the profane art of fwear
ng, as exemplified in page 129 and several
at'ner parts of Mr. Râ's performance ? â
One would think, from many (pecimens
hat might be adduced out of this farrago,
hat the author Ihould have placed in his
;itlepage the following motto :
" I leave you here a little look
For you to look upon,
That you may learn to curse andfuiear,
When I am dead and gone.'"
Neither do I approve of the freedoms Mr.

jook 3, where he evidently maketh jell of
loly things, and such as ought to be held in
â epute by sober minded persons."
