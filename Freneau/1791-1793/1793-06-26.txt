talerK3, ailivitjr, and 1 . proof* of patrio
tifin he had given, seem ' to -nfure tin
success of a million w itch iiâ vrr finer
beea considered one ol um nuifl Important
>n the app-iiumeut of the republic. His
d.epirttire from Genoa was retarded by
delays ariliui from the clio ce otprefents
toh* Sittai tet! with iiifti for the Grand
Seignior. The arti'is that were employed
0:1 them did not finilh their work till to
â wards the end of September. It to.ik near a
month longer to convey the perfents to
Toulon, where they were to by ihippfd.
Thcfe delays preva ited the departure ot
citizen Semonville till th end ot' 05tober.
In this interval the executive council was
informed not only of the intrigues of the
Â«>ldminifter,Choifeuil Gofiier. at the Porte,
bur of all the steps taken by the inirt'flerj
ot the combined powers, particularly by
the Neapolitan ininifter, to render, citizen
Semonville odious, and prevent his recep
tion at Conllatuinople, as ambafljdot
from the republic.
" In order to the success of our nepoci
ations with the Porte, it was neceflary
to expose tlw republic to an affront Which
ihe could noc otherwise than have relent
ed, and would bring on a rupture with s
power with which the ciri uinflam es ol
the times tlrongly urge us to remain or
good term-. The executive therefore con
eluded it heft to suspend the departure ol
Citizen Semonville, and fend a fccondarj
agent to Const mtinople. not only to m.ikÂ«
Avuy for the acknowledguir nt of the am
feafl'ador, b.it to enter prrivdionally upor
:negociations. which it would have beer
dangerous to deter ariv longer. Citizer
Semonville then received order? to remove
from Genoa to the ilia.id of Corlica, aur
Jiolc! himfelf in readmefs to depart at ;i
jmoinent's warning.
While the executive council were
taking every ncceflary precaution, the
Convention ordered the publication ot
the papers found in the iron chelt, in
the palace of the Thuillerren. A
inong tbefe pupei* was fnuild a letter
from Talon to the ci-devant king, in
â which lie proposeÂ» citizen Semonville aÂ«
fttcceflbr to Diimourier, in the mini (try 11

of the letter written by Talon is as fot
-4 >wsâ" Sire, The importance of the oc

Such a man is M. Seitu nville. The part

The encomiums bestowed by Talon on
the secret fetjtimrnti of citiienSeinouville,

m the executive council, vvlueh from such
' id errct. would have dlfinilfecl him at once,
f 1 tiÂ» y h id thought it their duty previ

'lit the delicate litustion in winch our af
nnv .ire. in respect to rhe Porte, and
.1 e'firy of freeing Our agent from all

nat it was a talk to ine to

VIENNA. April 8.
According to letters from Florence, the
Grand Duke of Tufcany, renouncing the
Mtcm ot'neutrality, his ordered M. I,af.
lotte, tlx"French minister, to quit his dates
within twenty-four hours.
The army of the Prince deSaxe Cobourg
will be dill augmented with 49,000 men,
tn order that proper gnriifons may. be left
in the Aultrian Netherlands, and that our
army may enter French Flanders before
the beginning of May.
The day before yelterday the third co
lumn of our heavy artillery began to march
from this capital. It consists ot three com
panies of cannrmieri, one of bombardiers,
and seventy carriages laden with ammu
nition and Implements .eceflary for carry

RATISIiON, April 3.
In the cunclufiun of the Empire, of the
Bid ult. when the war sgajnll Frs .ce win
declared, and the circulation of the French
aflicnats prohibited. it waslin ther resolved
That
" All treaties of peace hitherto conclu
ded between the Germanic empire and
France rre to be declared null, yet with
out pn jtidicing the rights of evt iy third.
" All written correfpoiidenee is to be
narrowly examined, but the commercial
ronneftions with France arc to be preser
ved till infringed by France hevfelf.
" All the states and vaff-iis of the Em
pire are to renounce their neutrality with
France.
" All frenchmen \vhe> cannot obtain a
permillion of from the maglf
â¢trates of a;iy port of the Empire, are to be
banished from all its dependencies."
O S T E N D, April 27.
The Bruflels while it laments the
obstinacy of the French, bears tcftilnony
to their intrepid conduit in the field. One
action there is ("aid to have hiitcd twelve
hours, and it is compared at fonie periods
of its duration to the battle of Jemuppe it
felf. The combined armies have, howe
ver, poflefied themselves of many polls ir
the French territory. St. Ainartd ha>
been lately occupied by them ; and the
Prit.lTa*s ore polled at Latinoy, Rotibray,
and Tnrcoltu, which are within five or lix
miles of Lisle itfelf. The greatelt diHref;
prevail: in thole (Jiftrifrs; so immoderate
is the price of articles of the firft necefiity,
that even to exist, it were necellary to bt
wealthy. Whether these difpolitions por
tend the (lege of Lille. I know not ; It
feetns, how ever prob ible, that when the
heavy artillery arrives, which Is expected
about the middle of next month, an at
tempt Will be made, which even if itlhoulil
nÂ« filtered, will not be inglorious. It is
generally believed in this country, howe
ver, that i.ille will be taken ; the reason
of which belief, as has been Hated to me
with much candour and funplicity, feenu
Eo b*. that that they cannot conceive how
the'combined armies will be able to get 011
f they do not take Lille. Certain it is.
rhnt If they do take Lille, their will make
1 moll important acqullition ; for the
tortbern departments of France, conlift
ng of an iminenfe plain, as far as Paris,
would br open to the ravages of cavalry,
ind a real famine might be added lo the
ong catalogue Â«f calamities which has been
iberally alligned to that republic.
BP-USSELS, April 26.
General Dumourier's profpeft of reftor
ng a king and constitution to France ha<
otally mi fear lied. lam the more sorry
"or it, as I am perfnaded itc fuCccfs uotild
lave saved a deluge ot blood. A limited
monarchy in my mind, is the belt govern
ment ; and fucli an alliance as was propo
sed to be the consequence, would have
ertainly fecureirto the French a rational
*y!tem of liberty. Thouglr I mult in mj
:onfcience, blame all foreign interferenct
'open or clandelllne) in the affairs ol
France ; yet as this interference has beer
rarried so far, I (honld have been glad tc
"*e it terminated in a way favourable u
humanity, and not inimical to freedom : ;
very different result may now be appre
hended. Jt seems as if this project had mif
rarried from want of co-operation at Paris.
Dumourier's letters avowing his delign:
ivere intended as the signal for the Orleam
jarty to rife. The afilinbly concealec
:hefeletters, and the report of the coin
inflioners, as long as they could ; it wa:
fiipa'rtant for thein to gain time, becauft
:he new levies were agitators. Had the)
Utemptcd a malfticre, they would havt
directly laid ho!d of. Tjieir emiflarie:
hreatened, in the tribunes or tne adembly,
ixty of the molt noted republicans, but die
lot dare to put their threats in execution.
In lliort, this infurreition not having taker
jlace at the time it was expected, Dtimon
rier durlt not venture with the few trÂ«OÃi
Utaehed to him into the heart of the king
lorn ; be propÂ» ed reinforcing his armj
*1 th a Wody of Anllrians, and this clrcum
lance cooled nioft of his friends. The
onflant method is to keep themselves tot
unich backward, and depend too fuuch or
lu irqpents, so that what has happened tt
iJumourier is 110 more than what btfon
uppened tcrthe late king of Sweden ant

DUEL.
Col. Gardner's mother alTurid us, t'h*
she had received a letter from her lon ai
Antwerp, informing her, tliaf a duel hat
been fought there between the duke ol
York and the prince of Orange, in whirl
the latter was run through the body. The
wound, however was not mortal.
It is to be 1 (marked, that the Ivvo prin
ces are married to the two irlnceliei ol
Prnflia.
The duel originated in the order giren
[Total Numb. 173 ]
by the Aadtholder some time fmce, which
was reported 1n (his paper, that all officer*
and foldiera negle&ing their dtity, should
be lent to the piovoft, which answers to
the newgate of this country ; the Britifti
foldicrs were not accepted. Hii royal
highness remonttratcd, and at last decla
red, in peremptory terms, that BritoDS
fhotiid obey the ordvrs of u Briton only.
There is at this time a much greater
numbc r of American veflels in the river,
than at any peried lince the independence
of the United States.
Lisle is well prepared to Tuftsin 3 siege ;
450 pieces of cannon are mounted on the
ramparts ; the garrison has fullicient ffores
oi ammunition'and provilions ; and all the>
approaches to it is laid under water.
On Tuesday were fold by public awftien,
In the city, the two firft French prizescon
demned this war. The one Le Cuflinc,
Was fold for 1151. and the othtr Les Sans
Culottes, for 140 âThese are the funis we
receive in return for prizes taken by them
to the amount of near 30,0001.
The premier, notwithfianding his elabo
rate display and enumeration of the re
fmtrces and opulence of the country, has
already changed his opinion upon that fub
ieft ; and what a few months part he def
piled and treated as trifling and inconside
rable, he now regards asobje&s offuchau
alarming nature, that all the /lei 11 and saga
city which may be employed upon the oc
alion, will probably prove in
iirinounting them. If the enquiry into
ihe (iate and condition of the country,
which Mr. Fox was so desirous might have
taken place, previous to the declaration of
war, had been brought forward and pro
perly attended ttf, the filccet ding misfor
tunes, which have nearly overwhelmed the
tomwei cial pm-t of the nation, <iould ne
ver have occurred ; and in lictt Of that de
(trudtion and defoliation which have taken
place in every branch of otir commerce
and manufactures, peace, plenty, and ge
neral unanimity, woftld have prevailed
throughout the nation 1 .
I he >ndile/iy oi Mr. Dfjndn* has long
leen proverbial ; if it were not, his late
ieclaration in tire Hotife of Commons,
would m:rke it so. That is, that the pre
ent diltrtfled titration of the trade and
:onimerce of the country, wns fairly at
tributed to her prosperity, Iter energies,
slid her spirit ot enterp'rize. V e know

(if the legislature, with the authority lie
lifed; and it is doubted by Binkerfhock,
whether he d d right in interfering at all on
tlie occalion.
If it be conliflent w'th treaties, and o
lherwife right, our leglflature can vest the
executive in future with similar powers.
I mould fnppofe too, thut the liberty of fel
ling prise-, in a,neutral country is not a
perfect right, anil may also be conlulered by
our national legislature, as a fubjeft of re
gulation. 1. any captures are made u ltliin
oar limits, and the ve'tels or plunder is
Wonght within our ports, the sale may be
forbidden, thjy ilUlft the.i be either aban
doned, or at- t-d tfv juri:dij;ti;:ii of
the captors ; where the proper courts will
oonlider of their leg nicy. \ct this is a
matter no: of judichl but of political ar
rangement and mull be left to those who
have the authority to diirefl. The fove
reigntyof nur nation is as complete as that
of any qrhtr.
Therefore whatever other sovereigns can
do, we hive in our power- But because,
&t thi: time, the authority fnppofed neces
sary on this occalion', is not as it is alledged
to be fount}' :n the executive branch, i do
not fee thai the judiciary ought to exercise
h, as a ice refnltjng from political
convenience or t|ie necelEty of the particu
lar cafe. This I fear would be a novelty
<liÂ£lated by our zeal, and might give canfe
of offence to one, while we Â» ere a fUiiig at
jn'lice to ourselves, or gratification to the
,'ther. I h-fit3te not to use any plain .u
----thority. I k.iow this court to polilft, let the
eulife-iuence be what it may. But this is a
queflion too important in its etfecls, to be
u.:;d on but on the furefl ground. I a
g. =e b. e, as I do in many of the r othi.r
jiofitioiis, with the advoifaies for the libel
la its, v. lien they fiy that ' courts of adnii
j a ty juri dittiaa are Icf> liab'e to-objection
as taefe courts are regulated fcy thlt laws
and cujlums of all natioi.s, and no liable to
political bias or entangled in political .o
i terations." Thislliculd itrtluce the great
er caution In iheir detennins'iouj. 1 have
not seen any proofs th t "//;e laws hvd cuj
fomt of all i.aliotu" wairant the interfer
ence of this court. If they do not, no au
thority can be dtr veii si om ortrou it!aw s, if
they were not fileiit on the fubieÂ£l. In the
exiffing arrangement of our g< vernrnent,
ve did not calculate on our relative titira
ioil, as to conte'ts Between o her nations.
J"t lor tills rc-afoii no immediate remedy is
srnd. who can jullly cenfnre the execu
tive when he has given dt cided evidence of
Ills impartial and just inclinations ? 'A hi
can with reason blame'the juri ciary, if the\
â v\ ill r.ot ifiume a power not conceived to
be vffled in them ? Kot the goveri irertt
of the country whose lubjefts are the libt!
tints, to whom I wilh every degree of juf
tace may be done. The principles eliab
lillied in the decisions of their own court:,
a id ike opinions of their mod celebrated
lawyers in the contells with the king of
t ulfia, in the cafe of the Silelia loan, in a
depree reach the poim, as to ju iuary
authority in a neutral nation.
In Palache's cafe, lam aware that-it is
only said the veSel 'â 'was taken at Jta,"
but if not, it rather appeals that it would
be more proper lor diplomatic than a ju
diciary examination. The general princi
ple as to tile capture is agreed j and is
CtisHnr to that efUbliflieJ hi otir treaty
with France, which ought to have its pro
per weight. _
It w.W re olved, by the while court of
King's B *ncb upon conference and delibe
ration, ttllt tite Spaniards whose Ihip had
bee i tak-'ii by an enemy, and brought into
Engla id, a friend to botii parties, had lo(>
the property of tlis goods forever, end had
no remedy for them in England. And re
lied principally upon 1 h-j books, in 2- R. -3
lib. supra being of so greut authority, for
by that book he that will 1 e to have refli
tntion of goods robbed at fei, ought by
law to prove two things, rft. that the sove
reign of tile plaintiff" was, at the time o)
taking, in amity with the king, of England ;
2d, that he wlio took the goods was, at the
time of taking, iu amity with the fovtrcign
of him whose goods were taken, then na:
it no depreditioh or robbery, but a lawfiu
taking, a? every enemy might take froi;
another." 4. ins. 154.
It is true that by the laws and cuftc.ni!
of nation-;, the capture if taken in neutra
bounds, is 110* a lawful prize ; but I <U
not fee that this court can get at that cir
cirinlta.ice, ivir/nut holding pleti as to tht
iawfalMjt of-'the prize. It is the origirta
qjieltiun and not collateral matter v. hicl
determine jurisdiction. The courts o;
common law in England will not take cog
tiiza c. of any thing aruing out of {he qu<. f
tion 'p ize or no prize, " because the ori
ginal caulV mult .11 come into c]tje/iinn a
;V'in " And yet the admiralty had deter
milled that the (hip was no prize.
This will be a proper fubjeOof enqnirj
on the part of our government,' or in Â«
co-.irtjd! the Country of rliV* captor. Even
nation has eftablifhert theft courts, an'
knowing that, f at war, tiit'y are answer
able 10 a nation at peace or in amity, ij
violation of territo y h'sppen in captors,
care is t. ken to examine into this circuni
itatKf. It on this account, the capture i:
illegal it is <oadj dgd: and th. j>art
is iiabie to dam. ge-s. Whether f(n.li da

its subject to others, contrary to, or with

are diltercnces of opinion aiisongft civil UiU
and which it is uuiieceflsry for me now tc

It is duubtlefs contrary 10 the hiftruSi

the Tammany Society had the pleasure of
the company of Citizen Hauterivc, the
Consul from the French nation to New
York, of Citizen Dll Plaine, Consul to
Boston, and Citizen Captain Bbinpard, of
the Ambuscade Frigate, with several of
his officer*. The Grandr Sachem upon
their being introduced-, addressed them in
the following animated manner:
Citizen s of Frantic
YOU now behold before yoÂ« a band of
Freemen who with an enthusiasm which
words can not defcribtr, regard you as of
the famegrrat family with themselves, even
as the fona of freedom. You behold fa
mily of brethren, who are bound in an in
diffolvable union, by the, remembrance of a
glorious contest, peculiar to the one you
and your countrymen are engaged in âYou
behold a society, who in this temple have
eredted an altar to freedom, and hold them
selves bound to prcftrve upon it a bright
and inextinguishable flame. You behold a
body of free citizens, anxious to manifeU
to your nation the warmth of their affec
tions, and the congeniality of their senti
mentsâto manifeft to their enemies at
home, tho' so feeble as fcarte to merit at
tention, that the principles they degrade
are their only protectionâto manifeft to
their enemies abroad, that the full enjoy
ment of civil liberty is pe*feÂ£lly conCltent
â with the full reflraint of licentiousness; that
the knowledge of freemen forms an irflii
ence more powerful to restrain, than the
rod of the despot : To manifell to their
countrymen of the United States, their at
tention to the general government, and
also t' e regularity, the peace, and the re
fpeftabili yof the policc of this city : To
m-inifcft to t! e world that the compkte
enjoyment ofliberty, inspires an exultation
a:>d enthuliafm of happiness, which no time
or eircumflance can extinguish : To man
ifeft to you the pleasure we receive in meet
ing on the sacred ground the defenders of
freedom, and of the indefeafable rights of
â man.
To which Citizen Hanterive replied :
Citizens of AmericaâBrethren 0}
the Tammany Society,
WE can r.ot leave this sacred place
without teftifying to you our real senti
ments. Brethren, friends, accept of our
real thanks ; of the purity of our hearts ;
of feiitiments of the mofl: ten er attach
ment, which yourlelves have imprefTed on
our minds.
You were the firlt born sons of libeity ;
your birth preceded outs. And after us
the whole univerfc will ent;-r into the fa
mily of a free people. We are friends, for
we have the fame interefb, and the fame
dangers threaten us. We aie charged
w th the noble taflc to-fiibdae the power of
tyrants ; and you, citizens of a country
â¢where despotism is deflroyed, you are
charged to prevent its refurrc&ion. Watch
brethrenâyea be watchful over the cradle
of freedom ! We are going to conquer its
enemiesâafter the victory, we will join
our laurels with yours, and under the fba
dow of the tree of liberty, the whole uni
verle will enjoy permanent happiness.
After which the society partook of a
plain repaft,prepared for the occasion. The
Grand Sachem gave a number of toasts, a
mong which were the following :
1. Success to the airoy of France in the
cause ofliberty.
2. Prdident Washington,
3. The National Convention of FvancÂ«.
4. In memory of the brave Americans
who fell on Bunkers bill, in the cause of
their country.
5. In memory of those Gallic r!eroes :
who fell at Jamappe,.in defence of liberty
and their country.
6. May the ties that unite America and
France never be. broken.
In the course of the evening a number
_qf patriotic songs were sung, and hilarity
and congeniality of fentimeiW prevailed.
The whole was conducted witk the
greatefl order- and decorum. At ten o'
clock the guefls retired, after, exprefiing
the higbefl fatisfaaion of the friendly and
affe&ionate manner in which they had
been treated.
Duel between the Duke of 1 ork and Prince

A gentleman in this city has received a

dated April 30th, ia which he mentions,
that " The iladtholder iflued sn order for
no troops to be absent from their garvifons
or encampmentsâwhich the duke of York
took umbrage at, faying, none but a Bri
ton should (command a Briion, r.nd spoke
in fuel) language as could not be brooked
by the ftadtholder's son, prince Frederick
of Orange : a duel was the confequenee,
in which the Dutchman was severely
wounded.'*

" We may now think ourselves very for
tunate, for through th* imposition of Di
ver, we were near losing our (hip. When
he applied to you in Ne*'-YÂ«rk, little did
we tin k v/e had a fnviggler to deal with ;
in two of the calks which we supposed tc
contain flax-feed, were concealed two hun
dred and four pieces of nankeens, which
being fufpefted by the Kevenue Officers,
Oive-f went on (hore and informed that he
had na. keens on board ; upo i which Mr.
Ne vburgh, the Collector, feixed the (hip,
telling me at the fame time that he v/ns
obliged to do his duty, but that I might
depend upon his afliftaiice in my unfortu
nate situation. I immediately (by-the ad
vice of the principal merchants in this
place) gave in a petition to Sir Hugh
Hill, Bart, the principal officer of his ma
jetty's revenue, who being informed that
every body on board the ship (Diver ex
cepted) was quite ignorant of tks nan
keens be'r.g on board, ordered the fitip to
be fold at auction according to law, evtry
body being convinced that 1 had not
been concerned in the smuggling,. gen*,
toufly declined to bid againll me, and 1
purchased the Mary from the revenue ol

BALTIMORE, June 14.
A well meant hint to the Executive of the
United States.
Translated Extrad of a letter from 1 re
fpe&able merchant at Rotterdam, [A
Hollander} to his friend in this town,
dated 20th December j 792.
" The French troops are near enough
to- our frontiers, and if they succeed in
driving the Prussians and Auftrians ovei
the Rhine, it is likely they may pay us s
visit, which will be altogether difagrceabk
to some, who, fhrw by their publication?
how much-they apprehend. The French
emigrants are now every where as much a;
profcritwd. What palpable con tradition!
in July it was publilhed, thÂ« ro asylum
ffiould be afforded to " their kings tr?i
tors," and now, as this king is inpprifoned,
and shall probably be sentenced to die on
the ftaifold, it is prohibited to harbour the
very men who espoused his cause- In the
firft instance, the American minister, or
agent, Shott, condutted himfelf not as an
envoy of a republic, but as a minion of def
potifro I he was among those who then
(hewed the French minister the mod dif
refpeft. How indeed, can it be otherwise :
My lord Auckland is his counsellor, with
out whose advice he does nothing.
"P. S. 21ft December, what I wrote
concerning Short i 3 true. He is Auck
land's friend. Make what use you pkafe
of itâit may be of service."
In addition to the above, the editors
are authorised to assert, that letters from
France to fereral merchants in this town,
received this week, bring information, that
the British cabinet are tampering with
our minister there, Mr. Govemeur Morris,
for the purpose of drawing these States
into a coalition of the rulers of Europe a
gainst France.
The profpecta of* our farmers in the back
country seems to have been considerably
checked by a recent circumftan e. They
had contemplated great benefits from tra
ding down the Ohio and carrying their
produce to their own vefleis ; but it is now
said, that a Ftench house lately eftablilhed
at New Orleans,,has obtained frem go
vernment a cotnmiffion to contract for
10,000 barrels of flour annually, io the
United States, which consequently wiii
throw a monopoly of tire fupphes into the
hands of a single firm, and although it may
for a time make no material difference
with refpeft to the present interest of our
western farmers ; still they will retain a
jealousy agaiml tiiofe who r*,\v limit their
freedom in commercial fpeculatior.s, and
there can be but little doubt that they '"ill
ultimately force a trade down those rivers,
which nature h.13 lsid down for the benefit
ind convenience of all America.
