Continuation of the Memorial upon the
bed means of improving the Com
merce and Manufactures of the Unit
ed States.
Article I. The afTociations of each di
ocese to assemble at some proper place,
to fix the day of meeting, and to distri
bute the articles to be manufactured.
An. 11. Instead of the general meet
ing of an association, aboard of commu
fioners may occasionally be appointed,
as an intermediate body, to nominate
truflees, clerks, &c,
Art. 111. The afTociations in any cap
ital city, may be held at the house of any
private citizen that offers it.
IV. This board to assemble once a
week ; the other boards to assemble at
lead twice a month. The absence of
Â»ny number of the members not to pre
sent those in the neighbourhood of the
place of assembling, from attending for the
purposes of the inditution. Such as
"hall absent themselves, to have their
iext apportionment of labor doubled.
V. Liberty being the great objeCt in
ill such societies as these, one of the firffc
principles of the society shall be, that
;very associated member, shall choose
he manufacture that he likes bed. If
my should be found so zealous as to
â nake no discrimination in this respeCt,
"uch will only be required to keep fepa
ate the different articles they lhall work,
ipon, to prevent confufion.
VI. The attention of the society
pught in the firdplace to be direCted to
igriculturc, manufactures, and com
nerce; to invedigate carefully their
idvanccment or decline ; the obdacles
preventing their success, and the means
o remedy iherru
VII. Every good citizen to be invit
ed to transmit to the society-direCtors,
memorials and observations upon the
ibove subjeCts ; such memorials, essays
Sic. to be received with complaisance by
he directors, who, in the name of the
whole body are to return thanks to the
authors and acknowledge the obligati
ons they lie under forthe fame.
VIII. Every member lhall be oblig
:d to give in to the office of the affocia
ion, before the next meeting of the
poard a circumdantial memorial upon
"ome subjeCt in agriculture, manufac
ures, commerce, or the arts.
IX. The associated body of each dio
:cfe shall keep a separate regider of
heir proceedings, in which fhalj be in
erted an abdraCt of all memorials &c.
hat may have been presented. Besides
his, the originals to be carefully pre
served. There shall be sent to the
board of direCtors of the capital town,
bree months before the assembling of
the provincial deputies, a copy of such
articles as shall seem bed delerving of
attention ; on which the board lhall
make a report, to be read before the
Hates met in assembly.
X. Besides thecorrefpondence which
is recommended to be kept up between
the members of the associated bodies, it
ivould much facilitate the service of the
society, that the board of direCtors in
the capital should be the central poinf,
is it were, of general correlpondence,
through whose means all inter siting dif
-ovcries and observations might be dif
'.eminated through the kingdom.
XI. The great end proposed should
lie the extension of ufeful knowledge.
The society should be particularly care
ul to return fatisfaCtory answers to all
ndividuals that shall make application
to them.
XII. When any ufeful discovery
shall be made, the direCtors individual
!v shall do their endeavour to make it
known throughout their didriCts, both
jy giving it a fair trial themselves, and
recommending it to others ; and above
ill by foiciblv inculcating upon huf
sandmen, artids, or manufacturers, the
advantages likely to result therefrom.

Numb. 23.XIII. The bufinefi of the commilTi
oners of the board shall have a general
relation to whatever concerns the inter
cfts of the kingdom, such in particular
as agriculture, manufa&ures, and trade.
XIV. The members of the association
aie particularly requested to correspond
with the neighbouring governments,
upon the means which appear to them
the aioft proper to render complete the
above fpecified regulations.
This society, as appears from the pre
ceding articles, had four principal ob
je&s in view, agriculture, munufa&ures.
commerce, and the arts.
1 heir plan was extremely complex
and vafl, and nothing but a union of an
immense number of determined persons
could promise complete success in so
arduous an undertaking.âTliefe affoci
atcd bodies in the year 1760 published a
volume of observations, and in an adver
tisement prefixed thereto, they invite
all public spirited and patriotic persons.
to communicate their ideas on those
fubjefts to a society, who wished to
make no further use of them than tc
publish them to the world for the gen
eral benefit of mankind. The members
of the iocieties, who had the public good
most at heart, considered themfelvesas a
fort of trustees for the general diffufio,,
of knowledge, and such as when im
parted fliould inspire all other good ci
tizens also with a fpiritof public benevo
lence.âBut their endeavours went ftili
further. ThÂ«y Hill considered them
felvesas personally obligated to laboui
continually in the school of experiment
and research. They exerted every fa
culty to inftrutt and inform such of theii
fellow citizens as thought proper to ad
v'ife with them. It is a truth, that the
success of all such establishments does
not depend merely upon politicalajfocia
lion, or simple incorporations of bodic.<
with exclusive privileges. Objects ol
such magnitude depend more for suc
cess upon communications ftotnthe va
rious cantons and diftri&s of a king
dom. In this cafe the collected wifdorr
that puts the great machine in motion,
is only the effort of the public, encour
aged and animated by the government
In refpeft to the numbers of those as
sociated bodies, their duty, as they have
explained it in one of their own publi
cations, is, among other particulars, tc
axamine into and make observation:
upon whatever essays are sent to them
and to repeat experiments, where the>
shall find cause to doubt of fa&s fpecifi
ed ; to establish a focicty which fhal
have a real and intimate connexion ir
all its parts ; to aflign the principles up
on which undertakings of an importan
nature may be prosecuted or given up :
to render an account of their proQeed
ings to the government, so that whate
er is of acknowledged utility may b(
encouraged ; and to make ufc of theii
own credit to surmount difficulties, ii
which a frugal arid patriotic adminiftra
tion will always do its part to aflif
them. ,
Agriculture and manufa&ures were
the two great objects with these affociat
ed bodies ; which to neglect (as the)
tliemf.eves observe) would be the rea
dieit means to deprive a state of its re
venue, a people of their fubliftence, the
great body of a nation of its rcfources
and would tend to leave to the multitudi
the wretched inheritance of poverty ant
misery.
It would be well for mankind if the)
would imitate the bees upon the flow
ers, who only take the choicest juice:
for the composition of their honey.
That nation may be called prudent
which is afliduous in copying the ex
ample of others who have been mofi
fuccefsful in cultivating the earth to ad
vantage, and in eftablilhing such manu
failures as lerve the general uses of oui
species ; and that man bed deserves the
thanks of a people, who either dissuade?
them from wrong pursuits, or instruct:
them in arts of which they have hither
to been ignorant. _ Men, in their focia?
state, have always wished that a multi
tude of individuals would furnifh theii
Separate ideas, in a clear and circum
stantial manner, on the great lubjects of
agriculture and home manufactures, that
by this means deficiencies might be sup
plied and what was wrong corrected.
The various modes of encouragemenl
for agriculture and manufactures might
be ealily fpecified and estimated, if men
had a complete idea of the nature of
foils in general ; of the different advan
tagesattendant upon different filiations:
t>f the qualities of grain that is sown.
and which might be Town ; what manu
facturing eftablifliments might be put in
action, and the be ft means to them
to perfection. The best methodsÂ°in use

also to be known ; the quantitv of grain

nanure proper for uplands and mea
dows ; and lastly, all other particular;
relative to husbandmen and manufactu
rersâmemoirs and efl'ays on these sub
jects have always been particularly no
ticed by the atlociated companies ir
France, and received with gratitude.
But these patriotic companies did nol
flop here. They extended their re
(earches and bounties still farther, and
promoted with the fame afiiduity the
prosperity of another branch of inqui
ry, nearly related to the two above men
tioned ; 1 mean, the arts, whether wc

Petition of Catharine Greene,
Widow of the late Gen. Greene.
On mouon oi Gen. Wayne, the house went
into committee of the whole, Mr. W. Smith irk
the chair; the report of the Secretary of the
Treasury on the petition of Catharine Greene,
widow of the late major-general Giecne, beiivf
under consideration.
Iheobje&of the petition is to obtain an in
demnification from the United States against cci
tain engagements which were entered into by
her husband, the deceased major-general Natha
niel Greene, while commanding officer in the
southern department; and for the circumstances
on which it is founded, refers to a representa
tion of the 22d Auguff, 1785, which was then
made by the laid general Greene to the United
States in Congreis alfembled.
Ihe petition is accompanied by a number of
voucheis, arianged in alphabetical order by the
Secretary of the 7 reaiury in his report: from
all which he draws the following conclusion
" That fliong and extraordinary motives of na
tional gratitude for the very signal and impor
tant lerviees rendered by general Greene to his
country, mult i'eive to give a keener Ding to the
regret, which ever to attend the i.eceflhv
of a drift adherence to maxims of public policy,
in oppolition to claims founded on uleful acts of
zeal for the public service, if no means of pro
tecting from indigence and penury, the family
of that moll meiitorious officer, fball, upon ex
amination, he found inadmiflible."
General I'/ayne mfc to give his reasons for
iuppoiting the petition.â
Mr. Chairmanâlt may not be improper to
mention the motives that impel me to wish a for
tunate ifiuc, in favor of the claim now ur.der con
sideration of this committee, which I mult alio
offer as an apology for the part I have taken,
or that 1 may eventually take in lupport of thar
claim.
Irorn my firfi interview with general Greene,
until the moment of his dissolution, we always
hvrd in the llriOefl habits of friendfhip and con
fidenceâHe was an officer with whom I had
participated of almost every vicilfituae of fortune
(in many a well tried field) from the frozen wa
ters of the north, to the burning sands of the
southâHe was a man whose virtues and talent; I
knew and reveredâbis noble foul would have
revolted at the idea of inipofitionâ he never
would have offered in a claim to Congress, hut
upon the purelf principles of honor and ju'fii:e.
1 was awitnefs of the pressing necefiity that can
pelted htm to become the luretv, for which in
demnity is now claimedâhe did what I would
have done (as second in command) had he been
abfem at that trying crisis.âThe claim 1 b,o Mt*> be 'ust âand I am decidedly of opinion thai
he was drawn into that fecunty from the fitua
lion in which he was placed by Congress, aÂ«
commander in chief of the (outhern department
-âUndÂ«r these impreflions, I beg leave toiubinil
to the consideration of this committee the fuitol
resolutions now in my hand âand doubt not ol
their concurrent support. â
Resolved, as the opinion of this committee
that the estate of tjie late major-general Natha
niel Greene ought to be indemnified for and or
account of the engagements entered into by thai
General with certain persons in the state of S,
Carolina, for the putpofe of obtaining fupplicj
for the American army, in the year 1783, and
that be granted to the execu
tors of the estate of the late major-general Na
thaniel Greene, for that purpose.
Resolved, That a committee be appointed tc
bring in a bill in conformity to the foregoing re
folction.
Mr. Boudinot said, there was no greatei
friend to the memory of general Greene than he
was, nor any person more anxious to have juilice
done to his widow and family; but he was ap
prehenhve that the resolution proposed by the
worthy gentleman who had firlf brought forwarc
thisbufmefs was not drawn up in such a rnannei
as to insure it a paiTage through both houtes ol
Congress. He wiliied therefore that it Ihould be
so expressed as to prevent any tedious diicuifion,
and at the fame time do ample justice. The re
port of the Secretary < f the Treasury puts the
lubje6ton the belt footing. The motives which
led him to make the contrast were, firft, the pub
lic good ; and perhaps secondly to serve hij
friend Mr. Burnet, because he was bis aid de
camp, and he wished to put him in the way oi
b ing established in bulinefs after the war ; bui
Mr. Burnet was never in any other way connect
ed with geneial Greene, than as a young mat
brought up 111 the family, whom he wished tc
patronize.
After a few other observations, Mr. T*oudino
moved toftnke out the preamble of the resolu
tion proposed by general Wayne, and to adop
words nearly in fubflance as follows :
Refolved,tha it is becomng the dignity o
Congress to make compenfalion for the widow ant
orphans of the late major-general Greene, who ft
gloriously served his country ; and that they bt
indemnified for the loss which his cftate is like
ly to fuflain by his having entered into ccrtair
bonds for supplying the southern army with ia
tions and cloathing, at a time when they wert
threatening to disperse.
Mr. Findley wished that the fuhjeft fhonld b<
brought forward in the mode prgpofed by the
firft mover of the question. The house must ci
ther grant relief, or refufe it ; and if a gratuity i;
offered 10 the familyof the late general Greene
I wifti. fa id he, it may be done in 'hat irfanne
which is befi (upported by principle ; m altiiÂ«<
thus our measures will be the most juflihable
With regard to the risk which the deceased ui
in making those conira&s, and giving his own fe
curity without the previous authority of Con
grefs obtained, it was done in the great eft emcr
f;encyÂ» and it is one of those caks for whirl
here is no general rule in any government; for
iHould the pnbhc service exclude the idea of al
nfks, we should not be so well served.' Then
is not any occasion for me to dwell upon tin
meritorious fcrviccs of general Greene, as the
aie universally known and acknowledged ; an<
with regard to the contracts made for the cloath
ing and rations of the southern army, the auxili
ary evidences now brought forward '. ere r:o
neceflary to convince me that he was in no b
ther manner concerned with the meicamili
house of' Banks and Co. than he has reprefeq'tu
in his letter to Congress of the 22d August
1785 : my mind is fatisfied of the purity of hi
intentions during the whole ccurle of the m
and indeed during the whole course ci his hf
The letters produced by. Mr. Banks have n<
weight with me to invalidate the veracity o
the brave and honed officer who is now no more
neither do I credit t he oath of that person w..of<
character is so generally known and despised
Under these impreflions I am for fympathifinj
in the claims of the petition; but the mode o
doing it is the point which requires consideration
Which of the two resolutions v to adopt, that o
the gentleman from G orgia, or of the gentle
man f 10m New- Terfey. That a gratuitous sup
port should he given I am fatisficc, and if it bi
asked, why ? I will fay, becaule it is due fion
this government in gratitude to the men ory of
;:all "it officer, and because it would be dilgrace
> the United States to fee his family in di(
tress. But it may be said, it will be efii'.hlifhim
a precedent and opening a door for numberlef
â¢other claims foniewhat ftmiiar thereto; arid
eonfefs there are very m ny cases of merit h
which deserve our attention : there an
alio many cases of officers who fuffered greatlj
111 the feivice of the country, who have not beer
rewarded ; if we look around we lee them in e
very quarter, and on the floor of this house
and it is not the men who have lerved us bell
that have been most fuccefsful, for we fee many
of ihern and their childten brought to nnfery and
diflre<ls, w hil ft others arc rolling in wealth which
they have accumulated peihapsfro.n the very luf
ferings of those who have served us bell both in
the cabinet and in the.field. There arc petitions
coming daily before Congress, many ol which
have ex Bieffed in terms iliat would Iccmiu jy
imply that the applicants slftnned to themfelvt..
the whole merit o! the revolution. Sir, Ido not
mean to dtfpute th.- inrrit of anv of thole peti
tionersâbut J niuil fjy th.:t the cafe Under oar
conudcranon is certainly as worthy of cur alien-
ion as any other: pet flaps it would be impio
>er to draw a scale, of the degrees of merit in
hofecafes; but I trust this will be taken up in
he way proposed by the gentleman fiom Geor
gia. We have an inftancc where we have fl
owed the commissioners for fettling accounts tc
ake up atuhorifed as well as unaiithorifed
:laims, and iurely this is not less deserving tharj
others.
Gen. Wayne thought it necessary to make fom<
>bfervations upon what had fallen from the gen
leman on his right (Mr. Boudinot)â- In order tc
this buliriefs in a proper point of view, ht
>egged leave to mention certain circumstances pre
vious to the evacuation of Charleston. Some o.
he characters in South Carolina obtained Â£
lag from general Greene to nfeec a deputation oj
nerchants and others, under a Hag from the Bri
:ifh linesâthose merchants were anxious to re
nain after the army, for the purpose of difpofmfj
heir flock in trade, and wilhed for a reafonaolc
:ime to tranfaft that bufmefs; this indulgenct
A'as readily granted, for it was thought an object
>f conference to retain i'upplies for the ufc of th<
rountry as well as for the army; and they were per
mitted to continue in the place for the space ch
\ ielve months after the abandonment should tak<
;ffccst. Assurances were aliiÂ© given them for thÂ«
nviolable prote<slion of their persons and proper
:y for that period. Thus fanAioned they wen
jrobably induced to speculate upon such stores a
he British army could spare, ( for that arnrv wa
â¢edundantly supplied) whilst the Americans wen
experiencing almost every polfible diibrefs for wan
jf the common neceffarics of life. About thi
ime hopes were entertained of the speedy appear
mce of afuperior water force from the French Weft
[ndies,to that of the . rkifti;and the operating arm;
under my command was advanced to the quarter
tioufe, in a position to prevent the enemy from em
barking with impunity, and to protect the towi
and its inhabitants from depredation and insult
thismanoeuvre had the desired effe&---it created;
jealousy in the British general for the l'afcty oi hi
fear,and general Leslie was in a manner compel!
Ed to come into a convention, more resembling j
capitulation, than an abandonment,for he was unde;
the necelfrty to "agree not to commit any inful
upon the inhabitants, or depredation on their pro
perty, or damage to the city, at or after his em
barkation. The word after caused some demur
but it was mfifted upon and complied with, in con
lequence of the orders 1 had previously receiver
from general Greeneâa measure which at onc<
afforded fecuciiy to the inhabitants, and a flatter
ing proiped of full supplies, as well for the citi
sens as for the army.
The gentleman f Mr. Boudinot) fays---how an
we to diftinguilh between the articles and necef
fanes that were actually made use of by the army
and of the other goods purchased of the Britift
merchants ?
This may be fully anfwercd and explained, ty
mentioning this fadlâ-that those merchants tool
(if tKi^if-fifiutiip J
us any articlc fKitabie for the army.'unicii their who!,
flock wire purchased together, having but twelv<
months to difpo'fe of their goods and colled: tlfeii
deutsi ânor could the necessary articles be ohtaiiiec
at the point of the bayonet, as the merchants were
protected by a compad made under the fan&ioi:
of a flag. Nor would they trust the contraftoi
Banks, with their property, unlefsgeneral Greem
became his security ; by which ad, in their opi
nion, the United States would be bound in honoi
to fulfil a central made by their commanding
olhcer; nor did general Greene come into the
measure until compel! :ti ! y direii ceffity, to pre
vent a irv.tiny. anci diffghuion of the army. Anc
such wasthe cxhaufted/ituation of the country ir
tne vicinity of Chailefion, that the executive anc
legiil ture found it expedient to fend a diflanc<
rnto the coiimty to obtain supplies for thetnfelve
and the refugee families who.were returning tc
the citv after the evacuationâin fa& we wer<
undei the neceflity of taking pari of this very pro
fion, to prevent an iwfiantaneous revolt.
But the gentleman (Mr. Boudmot) fays thai
Gen. Greene's piivate frieridfhip for major Bur
nett, who had been his aid-de~camp, was a pecu
liar inducement for his entering into that secu
rity, and that major Burnett had mortgaged ar
ill id to general Greene as a col later;*. I fecunty.
1 his indeed was an ast of private ft iendihip â
but it was a fuhiequent tranfaftion, arid no wavs
connected with the former, nor is it amongtt the
chargesâthis was a private purchale by maiol
Bui netr, from Mr. John M'Qneen, a gentleman
well known in South Carolinaâand it wa>
thought to be a very advantageous pur chafe fo
major Burnett at the time it was made (altho 1
11 has turned out Â©tberwife) but it was nectflary
for him so obtain fecunty, previous to receiving
titlesâ He applied to Gen Greene to become
Ins fecunty upon that occasion, which was com
plied withâand in that ast he certainly difplayec
a luperior degree of private fiiendfhip, and fuel:
as lias already been fouud.e*tre,n;ely ii:jii r ious tc

M . Chairman âThere never can be any dan

or the page of hiflory never did before, nor 1

recice.t, i. e. an army facing and furmountina

IN fathoms five, the anchor gone,
While here we furl the fail,
No longer vainly laboring on
Against the western gale j â
While here thy bare and barren cliffs,
O Hatter as, I survey,
And ihallow grounds and broken reefs*
What /hall amuse my stay !
The Pilot eomes !âfrom yonder sands
He flioves his barque so frail,
And hurrying on, with busy hands
Employs both oar and fail.
Beneath this rude, unfcttled sky
Condemned to pass his years,
No other ihores delight his eye,
No foe alarms his fears.
In depths of woods his hut he builds
Where ocean round him flows,
And blooming in the barren wilds
His simple garden grows.
His wedded nymph, of fallow hue,
No mingled colours graceâ
For her he toils, to her is true,
The captive of her face.
Kind nature here, to make him blest
No quiet harbour plann'd,
And povertyâÂ»his constant guest
Restrains the pirate band.
His hopes are all in yonder flock,
Or iome few hives of bees
Except, when bound for Ocracockf
' Some gliding barque he fees $
His Marian then he quits with grief
-And spreads his tottering fails,
While, waviaghigh her handkerchief,
Her commodore {he hails :
She grieves, and fears to fee no more
The fail that now forfakes,
From Hatteras* sands to banks of Core
Such tedious journies takes !
J*jnd nymph ! your sighs are breathed in vain
Restrain those idle fears :
Can you, that fliould relieve his pain,
Thus kill him with your tears ?
Can absence thus beget regard,
Or does it only seem ! â
He comes to meet a wandering bard
That seeks fair A Alley's ft ream.
Tho' disappointed in his views,
Not joylels will we part $
Nor shall the god of mirth refufe
The balsam of the heart :
No niggard key shall lock up joy }
I'll give him half my (lore,
Will he but half his /kill employ
To guard us from your fliore.
When eartern gales once more awake
What dangers will be near !â
Alas ! I lee the billows break,
Alas! why came I here
with auarts of rum and pints of grrf
Go, pilot, seek the land,
And drtryk, till you and alt your kin,
Can neither fit nor (land.

powerful palfions of the human mind, and altho
an artful man may readily afl'ume the maik o
difintcreftednefs and moderation, yet a just com

the mirror to the portrait of the public minister
and reflect his marked and genuine features, un

nt-r's brulh, or the high founding but proftituti
praises of sycophantic flatteryâ-Confiftency of con
dutt may be regarded as a virtue both in publii
and in private lite, and the man who on othei
occasions has laboured to establish principles an<
opinions* which when he becomes a public minis
ter himfelf, is the firft to violate and disregard
demands at lead that his public conduct lliouh

led to these reflections by a review of the mcafure
proposed, lince the adoption of the Federal Con

finances and at the head of the treasury depart
ment of the United States. He has devised fyl
tems that have already produced consequence:
mod pernicious to the interests, honor and happi
jicfs of our country j systems which, like seas c
corruption, will, if purlued, overwhelm and deftroj
in their poisonous current, every free and valuable
principle of our government. To contrail thof<

then, that at the period referred to, his utmost la

writings of Publius than in all his speeches in th<
Oatc convention of New-York, to fatisfy the pub

"that the fountain of legislation would be pre
