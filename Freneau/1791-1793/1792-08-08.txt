On the folicy of keeping Jbut the ,doors ojth"
Se'iaie of the United Stutzs*
[From the Universal Asvium.]
THE Senate having hitherto prefever
ed in their doors fliut, the
publi must not expect much information
refpe&irg the deliberations of that branch
or the federal legiflnture. Like the my
steries of free masonry, the reasons ofthei>
condnft, it seems, are never to be divulg
ed. Even the arguments agaiuft opening
their doors, (if any such arguments have
leer. uf-u ) have not been ma 'e public ;
a the' tr i. ou!d seen proper, for thefatil-
Fadli .i of that numerous ciafs of citizens,
â wlit hrve publicly exp.effed their difap

thio mv lerious condudt of the Senate
W' a prehend they mayâAnd, if so
the evil v probably increase, while itâ
cause if fuffered to exist. It is indeed,
itnpofiible that a free government should
long be maintained, in any country, the
citizens of which are kept in the darK,
with refpeft to public measures. If rulere
will cx;:< 3 obediencc from the people,
they must not treat them like Haves ;
they mull convince them of the reafcna
blenefs and propriety of 'lie laws, or they
will not continue to refpeft and obey them.
BUfcey (1-ould, they would be unworthy
of freedom. If, like the idolaters, who
er;Sed an altar ' To the unknown God,"
a people are content ignorantly to obey,
they are fiaves, in the worst sense of the
wordâfiaves, of their own choice. We
feel too deep an interest in the freedom
and welfare of our country to suppress
these sentiments. We, however, advance
them with the more confidence, becauie
we are convinced that they are not ou;
lentiments alone, but those of a large ma
jority of our fellow citizens, throughout
the United Stares. If, as it has been con
tended by many, the ilate-governments
are likely to have th-ir powers encroached
uprn, by that of the union, it would be
an injustice to the state-legislatures, to
suppose, that they will be so negligent
of their own or the people's rights,asto re
elect any of their federal senators, who
have voted againit opening the doors ol
that body. The house of reprefenta
tives might, with equal propriety, fliut
their doors also ; but this they will fear e
ly attempt, while they are immediately
responsible to the people, by being ren
dered dependent upon them for their feats,
at Uie end of every two years.
ON GOVERNMENT.
IT is very singular that any discussion
cr difficulty couhi ever have arisen among
moral or political reafoners, concerning
the natural equality of man, or that the
promulgation o* a p'-opofition fx evident,
ffiould ever have been necessary of the
â¢one pait, or should ever have given oil ,-c
fcf the ether , fmce the slightest view ot
this fubj,-a fhou'.d have determined that
the very idea o! government includes th.
idea of the equality of man, as of a firfl
principle.
"It is admitted that no government 01
no society, even among bands of robbers,
could subsist tor a moment, if Jufiice were
entirely baniflied ; and, that with jullice
though every other virtue were proscribed,
as is generally the cafe among lawless
confederacies, society may yet be fuftam
ed : the great principle then of the fo<-i
al union or government, is Jufiice ; with
out it none can fibfitt, with it, â¢ all may
But if we look into the nature of this
principle, so efTei.tial to society, we (ball

find it to be neceflarily connedled with
tlie equality of man ; insomuch, that e
quality is the cause, without which, justice,
the eff.ct, could not possibly have place.
Why is Caius just to Titus ? or why does
society compel him to be io, ii he is not ?
it is because there is a natural equality be
tween Caius and Titus : but you fay, the
iuterefts of the community require that it
should be so, and not the natural equality
o{ the persons ; to this I answer, that the
interests of the community are only an in
termediate cause, which itfelf depends
on the equality of the persons; there
can be no interelts where there i< no Veci
procity, and there can he no reciprocity
where there is not equality ; else, why is
the idea of Jufticie common only amcni
the human species ? Why is it not extend
ed by men to the birds of the a r and the
beails of the field ? It is because the boun
daries are here clearly diftingm(hed, and
the natural inequality of t'.efe parts of
the animal creation to man, would ler. er
the idea of justice, as between man and
(uch parts of the creation, too absurd to
he entertained ; and as it ;s the natural
inequality of fiich dillintt fpec.es, which
prevents them from ever coalescing ar.d
uniting in a commonwealtu with man ;
To it is the natural equality of man, which
giving birth to Juflice enables the human
[pecies to unite, to form commonwealths,
;nd to reciproca' e hanpinefs.
"All men then are equal: this every
government mull suppose, or none could
[land, for none could fland without juliice,
which has for its basis equality. But
men cannot be equal in some refpefts, and
i".ct equal in others i therefore, they are e
:::ial in all refpefts Therefore, what
.â ver government eftabhfnes
among men, or grants privileges to some
which it withholds from others, departs
Trom its true principle. 'I his, indeed, is
;he cafe with moR existing governments ;
the fpnrk of life which has kindled them
into exiflence, is quite extinguished, or,
faintly glimmering in the obfeure recess,
is discovered only by the keen eye of phi
losophic research. \_Morn. Chron.~\
CHARLESTON, July 17.
Saturday last, being the anniversary of
the French revolution, The members of
the French Patriotic society, with several
other French gentlemen, descendants from
French families, and other friends of
liberty and the French constitution, agreed
to celebrate that auspicious day, by dining
together in public ; in order to unite, by
that means, themselves, their sentiments
and aflfe&ions, with their brothers in
France. âAt noon they went to the
church of the French poteftants, to af

After the Tc Deum, Mr. Code preached
a very eloquent ferraon. When the cere
mony was over, they returned to the ex
change, where Mr. Luby delivered a dis
course well adapted to the occaiion.
At 3 o'clock they fat down to an ele
gant dinner. Good humour and chear
fulr.efs prevailed until the moment of fe
paration.
A number of convivial and patriotic
songs weie sung; and during the enter

,vhich from the one hand throws on the
ground the fanatic monfler, holding in his
lands the book of the dark science, which
"o many centuries have not rendered more
rlear, and which, instead of enlightening
men and rendering them better, did no
thing but didraft their minds more and
more, and cause them to commit the mod
dreadfjl crimes. The snakes which sur
round fanaticifm, are the emblem of the
enfnarjng and venomous discourses which
the fanatics used in order to feducd the
people and to incline them to civil war, to
support their interests and their ambition,
under the pretence of supporting the cause
us God and religion. The bloody poig
m:rd which it holds in the other hand,
calls to our minds the affafiinations, parri
cides, and murders committed during the
crusades, the league, the revocation of the
edict of Nantz, and St. Bartholomew's
day ; and to give us, by that means, an
idea ot all the infamous crimes which it
has inclined men to commit. The light
which is placed on the head of Truth, is
designed to direct France and all other
nations to avoid those fatal rocks.
Bth. Above fanaticifm appears the
shade of Mirabeau, who resorts to the F.ly
fian fields, where he is kindly received by
Ktnry the fourth, Voltaire, RouiTeau,
Franklin, &c.

appear the fliades of some aristocrats, who
beg of Charon a place in his boat, in order
tocrofs the river Styx, & resort to the Ely
fian fields ; But Charon havinglearnt that
they had been ariilocrats, drives them out
with some strokes of hisoar, fromhis boat,
and casts them into the river as unworthy
to enter the Elyfian fie'ds.
The society believes itfelf obliged to
render public the patriotism which Mr.

The society was the more fatlsfied, at
M. Charles Pinckney, governor, and the

honored the company with their pre

" On the 28th of April we received

inhabitants, and the Germans on our paf

libertv, live the nation," and warmly en
couraged our attack upon Mors. At three
o'clock we began the attack, and contim.- 1
ed until night, when the firing on both
fides ceased. Early the next. morn : ng,
the attack was renewed, but an unaccount
able terror had seized the dragoons of the
Queen's regimentâthey fired fo'eiy three
putols, and running off, cried " lave them

expjfed to the fire of the enemy, and fome

canrron, with which we refilled their
whole force, tho' they surrounded us upon
evr-y q'urter. The spirited behaviour of
our soldiers upon this occasion, secured
the retrÂ«at of the French army, who re
turned the fame day far Valenciennes.
M. Rochambeau, who commanded our
army, has been charged to have caused
this defeatâmany of the soldiers upon
their retreat, cried "treafon."âlt feeing
a limilar misfortune has happened to the
small army commanded by M. Dillon, who
was the fame day making a falfe attack
upon Toil may, to facilitate taking o!
Mons : âThe soldiers enraged at being
betrayed by tficir commander, cut him in
pieces upon the spot, and burnt him. to

Extratlsfrom Engli/h papers to June 10.
LONDON, June 9.
Party cabal is bulily employed in endea
vouring to turn Count D'Aranda out oftiie
Ministry. The under-ftrappers of Count
Florida Blanca have encreafed the number
ofthofe enemies, that ignorance and l'uper
ffition formerly railed against D'Aranda ;
great pains are taken to inculcate the idea,
that his chief reason for adopting a pacific
fyltein with respect to France, is because
the new constitution abolilhes the clergy
and the monks; and that he intends to do
the fame thing in Spain. Absurd as these
insinuations are, there is reason to fear,
that when artfully enforced by intriguing
courtiers,and by certain fanrtified charaflers,
they will produce their effert, and deprive
Spain of the ferviAjs of the only man who
is capable of fuccefsfully promoting her
prosperity.
The new regulations for the French ar
my are, in many particulars, very severe.
Whosoever, within reach of the enemy,
speaks a word, or utters any exclamation
contrary to order, is condemned to be put
in irons for 6 years. Marauding is rigorously
punilhed, and also the harlh treatment 0/
prisoners. Death is the punilhment of any
fold:er, who cries out "we arecut cjf y " "We
are betrayedor any thing of limilar tenden
cy. No man in command is to he after
wards queltioned fur arts offeverity, which
may become necessary during an engage
iÂ»< nt. This article is thought hard but
it is thought indispensable in the heat of
artio I.âOfficers are fubjeft to double the
punilhment incurred for any fault which
they neglert to repress, or any art of diso
bedience to which they give way.
F.xtraEl of a letter from Madrid, May 7.
" Monsieur de Bourgoing has been re
ceived as Mmifter Plenipotentiary of the
King of the French. He was well received
at court, and has received and paid all the
cuftornary visits. The admiffioii of that
minifler is equivalent to a formal recogni
tion of the new constitution : wherefore
the refugees and their adherents loudly
complain of having been deceived in their
expectations. This success is owing to the
â wifdoin of the Spanilh miniflry, as well as
to tlie prudent conduct of M. deÃourgoing.
and "o the delicacy for some time part ob
served by the French government, towards
the court of Madrid. We cannot howe
ver conclude from the admiflion of a mini
fler plenipotentiary, that Spain is disposed
to perform all the conditions of the trea
ties by which file is united to France : but
at lead we may expert ftie will remain neu
ter, and that a perfect harmony will fnbfift
between the two nations.
" Every mind here seems flruck with afto
nifhmsnt to observe how deep an interest
the court of Prussia appears to rake in the
ailairs of France : nor can people conceive
-why Prussia thinks herfelf obliged to exert
her whole force. It is (ufperted that the
Prussian monarch is only the tool of
another power that (kulks behind the cur
tain, butis'much more interested than he,
in the ruin of France. So generally preva
lent is this opinion, that even Spanifii loyal
ty itfelf could not refrain from demonflra
tioils of contempt for those Frenchmen who
rejoice at the league formed against their
native country. It is certain, that the re
fugees, who have, called in alliltance even
of the enemies ot France, have proved
themselves iijfamous traito s, and that the
irregular conduct of the factious citizens
(to which rhey themselves had given rife)
cannot potfibly palliate their guiic."
i.etter from Marflials Luckner and Ro
chambeau, read before the National Al
fembly of France, relative to the repoi
teilmg ot the French frontier town of
bavay.
On the r 7 th of May, at day break, the
patro.es of ?he polt at Bavay returned, re
porting that they had not observed any
tiling. Not long after a body of the enemy,
Of about three thousand men,- made its ap
pearance in three columns, coming out of
the toreif of Sarthe ; âone column march
nig towards the road to Maubeusre, the
other towards the road of Valenciennes,
and the third keeping between the other
two, oppolite to the centre of that part of
the town of Bavay that fronts the sorest ot
bai the; their cannon were brought to plav
upon the town, which hoisted national co
lours.
The French detachment of 80 men, sta
tioned at Bavay, liiewed much courage,
ana killed and wounded some of the ene
my : but, according to the. declaration
made by the municipality to Marshal Luck
thfy deviated from the express orders
of Marshal Rochainbeau, who had directed
the 111 to, occupy the centre of the to.wn, tc
tall back before a fu'perior force, antP .-on
nder themselves limply as a patrole. The
detachment 011 the contrary, attempted 3
vigorous opposition, inltead of withdrawing
by the gate of Louvigny, 011 the fide of
Quelnoy, and were made prifonersof war
An oihcer and some men of the third r e~i.
mentconduaed themselves with more pru
dence and propriety. They fell back, only
after the surrender of the town, waited for
the infantry behind Louvicny, but finding
that they did not arrive, fell back through
Qiiefnoy upon Jail in.
As soon as the Marflials were informed
01 the movement of the enemy, they p-ave
oia'ers to M. Noailles to march immediate -
.y with a vanguard, conipofed of 3 fn,,ad
ions ot huflars, 3 companies of the ift regi
ment of chafTeurs, 2 of the fifth, 2 pickets,
and 2 pieces of artillery. Marflial Luckner
went forward with the van guard and M.
Noialles.
At the fame time, Marlhal Rochambeau
determining to take Bavay, whatever forces
the enemy might defend it with, put in mo
tion the battalions of the sth, 27th, and
74th regiments of infantry, 2 squadrons of
the 17th regiment of dragoons, anil 4 eight
pounders. The marlhal ordered at the
fame time, a detachment to move from
Maubeuge and one from Quefnoy : the
fir ft with artillery. They took an advan
tageous fitnation before Jallin, whils the
troop; that were to co-operate moved for
ward.
I he Marshal gave orders to the van guard
to reconnoitre the position of the enemy,
to enter Bavay if evacuated, and tofummon
it to surrender if otherwise.
Marlhal Luckner informed Marlhal Ro
chambeau, byM. Montpenlier, as an ex
press, that the van guard Had entered Bavay
at 11 o'clockâtwo hours after the enemy
Imd left it; that they (the enemy) had ta
ken with them 6 carriages full of wounded.
The enemy entered Bavay 2,300 m number,
with 6 pieces of artillery.
TOO much praise cannot be given to the
(Hence and rapidity of the movements of
the van guard, under General Luckner, as
well as of the troops immediately under
General Rochambeau.
N. B. The enemy wilhed to pillage Ba
vay ; but the Austrian officers opposed with
threat severity the wilh of the l'oldiery.â
I'hey took with them the arms of the inha
bitants. They fell back with expedition
behind the sorest of Sarthe whence the>
came. The Marshal left a Imall body ol
troops at Bavay, which will be reinforcec
as circumstances may require.

[from France, June I.]
It has been proposed to reinforce the
F rencii armies with interior camps, cover
ing and supporting those which are advancet
towards the enemy's frontier. This ma\
be ealily done : as f ranee has now not lefi
than four hundred thousand men in arms.
The French have much to hope from the
jealousies of their enemies : the Auftrian
and the Prullians are not only diffident cl
each other, but decline Siting with the emi
grant princes and their troops. This fic
tion prevails among the arillocrats as weli
as in the heart of the National Aflembly.
Political, like religious institutions, flou
rish by persecution. Thus it is with the
friends of the people, who augment dailv
111 numbers.
The tranfaftions of the French National
Aflembly have presented very little that is
intereftirtg for this few days, pall. The an
swer of his Britannic Majesty, affertine in
the mo ft positive terms tile absolute neu
trality of England, and the strict adherence
of that court to the terms of the exiftinn:
treaties was read in the Aflembly, on Thurs
day 1 ast, and gave great and universal fa
tisfaction.
From all partspatrioticcontributions are
coming for the support of the war. The
city ot Bourdeaux has sent 77,000 livres,
chiefly ill specie ; the 46th regiment of in
fantry, 2,608 livres in specie, and 6jo livres
in aflignat-s. In its address to the Aifemblj ,
this corps gallantly declares, that it depolits
its silver on the altar of its countryâ-its
Heel it reserves for the enemy.
In about weeks, it is reckoned that
the emigrant army will be ready to make
nil irruption into 1" ranee. Xt i their inten
tion to penetrate by the Black Forest, which
joins that of Ardennes ; and to endeavour,
through Campaigue, to force their way to
Paris.
j ' le v,a '' ona ' Aflembly,on Saturday,fet
tled the future salaries of the Ministers. It
was decreed, that the Minister for Foreign
â¢ nairs should have an appointment of 75,000
ivres (about three thousand guineas) a year,
the other Ministers 5 0,000. This, though
an ample allowance, does not exceed the
emoluments of the chief clerks in the pub
lic offices of England.
In the course of this fitting, the War
Minister laid before the Assembly the plan
ot anotlier federation, to be formed in a
camp to the-northward of Paris. Each
canton to fend five men, clothed and armed,
to renew the oath to live free or die, 011 c
or these men to be a horfenian ; thus a na
tional cavalry might be formed, and a camp
of 20,000 men, which would cover and pro
tcft Paris.
The French paper money is now at as
great a discount a it has been at any period
lince the revolution ; the patriots, howe
ver, have no cause to def'pond. It should
be remembered, that the paper money oi
the Americans was under a depreciation at
least ten times greater ; and they, instead
of only failing of their purpose in two or
three (light skirmishes, were beat in every
successive engagement for two years toee

When I left camp for Valenciennes,l gave
Â°"^ rsto â¢*> body, detached under the orders
of Camp-Marfiial Gouvion, to take poflef
lion of Come forage intended for the ene

lippeville.
The oiay before yesterday upon my re
turn, I learnt that this expedition ha per
fectly succeeded. Colonel Lallemand com
manding the foraging detachment, had the
(aine day been followed, but not interrupt
ed by the enemy.
Yesterday at' day-break, M. Gouvion
was attacked at Hamptinne, r.ear Floren
nes by a force greatly superior, that had
collected from several quarters.
He had only under hi-; command here,
the firft battalion of National Volunteer'
ol the Cote-d'Or, the second of Maine, the
Sith and 85th regiments of regular infan
try, the 9th of light infantry, fix squadrons
ot the 3d and nth of mounted Cliafleurs,
a company of the 6th regiment of Huflars
and 8 four pounders; in all lei 3 than 4000
men.
The enemy more than double the num

tilleiy but, notwithstanding this
i'liperiority, AT. Gouvion declined retiring
without firft making some opposition.
I (Ã¼bjoinan extract of the account this
General officer has given me;âit follows :
The Austrian vanguard was at firft, twice
driven back by a detachment of light infan
try, grenadiers of the 55th and one fqir.i
dron of the nth regiment, the whole under
the orders of a lieutenant colonel, who on
ly gave way at die third attack, and then
formed a junction with two companies oi
vomntecr grenadiers polled in ihevillase 01
St. Aubin. a
While the defence of that village was
pnrfning, M. Gouvion. feeing that the ene
my displayed a superior force, put his camp
111 motion towards Philippeville, leaving
behind about 20 tents, which could not be
taken lor want of a lufficiency of carriages.
1 he cannon of both bodies played for a
considerable time 011 each other ; and a co
lumn of the enemy having dil'played on the
right of our troops and there eftablifned
batteries, M. Gouvion, to prevent their
eroding a hollow road, placed upon his
wing th- 11 th regiment of cliafleurs under
Col. Lallemand; the 3d under Col. Yiclor
L,atour-Maubourg and the company of the
th regiment under Capt. Blondeau. These
troops were exposed to the fire of the ene
mies artillery, but stood firm and Ihewed
the mod cool courage. But as the enemv
were preparing in great force to cross the
hollow road, which separated them from
the infantry, the volunteer battallions oi
Cote-d'Or under Lieut. Col. Cazote ; of
la Marne, under Capt. and the
iith 83d under Col. Devilione, and
Lieut. iâol. Champolon, were formed in
columns, by half battalions and retired cx
aftly in the order intended ; each body pre
serving its proper distance,âthe cavalry
covering the infantry while performing this
manoeuvre, and the artillery making nfe' ot
every advantageous situation to anuoy the
enemy.
During this retreat of half a league, three
pieces of cannon did execution to last
moment (one of which fell into the hollow
1 o id, but v ere taken, their horses having been
Killed. A fourth was saved under a heavy
hre by artillerymen, and a few volunteers
Cote-d'Or. The enemy having then
fallen back to the place from which they
darted, were !'o closely followed, that their
cavalry oi the rear guard attacked three
times the detachment that pursued, and the
field ot battle was occupied by our detach
ments two hours after the action.
i he artillery of the van guard was com
nianded by lubaltern officers M. cte Manne
court, commanding at Philippeville, ma
naged with much /kill four pieces of cannot*
belonging to that place.
1 incloie an account of our killed and
wounded. The enemy's loss is greater than
ours, because our advanced detachments
were defended by hedges and villages, that
our artillery was admirably managed, and
that it was thought best, rather toÂ° rifle its
being taken, than to diminiffi its execution.
Sir, tlieaccou.it given me by M
Gouvion. I cannot fpcik oo highly of his
condua in the command of the corps under
him. The head officers, Col. Deinottes,
the officers, subalterns and soldiers all de
lerve great credit,
I have the more pleasure, Sir, in com
municating to you an account of this affair
as, lor five hours, not one man left his
ranks, and as the-troops preserved perfect
lilencc, comppfure, and (hewed all the coil
i age that could have been expected from
veterans.
I brought here yesterday evening a body
of reserve. composed of some companies of
grenadiers and squadrons, under the com

STATE PAPER.
Tr(inflation of an official note lately presented by
M Chauvelm, the French Minijler at the Court
of London, to Lord Grenville, on the 24th ult.
THE under-signed Minister Plenipoten
tiary from the King of the French to his
Britannic Majesty, has the honour to inform
Lord Grenville, Minister of state for the
I oreiga department,
" That the Royal Proclamation published
:)n the 21 It of the present month, and com
municated to the two houfesof parliament,
contains fomeexpreffions, which appear (110
:loubt contrary to the intentions of the Bri
:ifli miniliry) to give credit to the errone
ous opinions which the enemies of France
drive to propagate, relative to the inten
tions of Great-Britain.
" If individual* of this kingdom have en
tered into a foreign correspondence, tend
ing to excite troubles, and if, as the procla
mation feerrls to insinuate, some Frenchmen
nave |oined into their views, this is a cir
cumstance unconnected with the French
nation, the legislative body, the king and
-lis minifterr: it is a faÂ£t entirely unknown
o them, entirely repugnant to all the prin
ciples of juilice, and which, 011 being fliewn,
will be universally condemned throughout
France.
"Independantly of those principles of jus -
-ice, from which afree people ought ne
i-er to depart if any one is anxious to re
ileft candidly on the true interests of the
French nation, is it not evident that thev
mult be, wxiaus for the imertal peace, andthe source and duration of the coiiflitution
of a country which they already look upon
as a natural ally ?
"Is not this the sole reasonable wish
which a people can form, who pcrceive so
many efforts exerted againlt their liberty ?
" The minister plenipotentiary of Fra ice,
profoundly penetrated with these truths
and maxims of universal morality, has al
ready developed them in an official note
presented to the British ministry by the ex
press order of his court, on the 15th of the
present month.
" Thehonourof France, the desire which
she entertains to preserve and augment the
good intelligence between the two coun

doubts on this fubjea, requiring that it
should acquire all possible publicity, the
under-flgned minister plenipotentiary,
begs Lord Grenville to obtain permission
from his Britannic Majesty to communicate
the present official note to the two houses

PHILADELPHIA.
August 8, 179::.
Copy of a letter from Germantown, Augujl 6, 1792.
" The Editor of the National Gazette
will oblige his friends heÂ»e by inserting the
following account of the blowing up of the
powder-mill at Lower Merion ; âthe ac
counts hitherto published being greatly
mis-stated.
" On Thursday morning last, a little af
ter 9 o'clock, this town was alarmed by
a molt tremendous explosion, -from the
blowing up of the powder-mill, lately
erected by Meflrs. Frailey and Keyfer in
Merion, near Schuylkill. The people rar
from all quarters, and, ihocking to relate,
found four persons killed on the spot, and
two wounded, one of whom is lince dead ;
the other was Mr Frailey's daughter, who
had her leg broke by a piece of wood
thrown from the buildings to the distance
of near one hundred yards. âMr. Joseph
Evaus, who was the only one in the mill,
saw the fire catch in the mortars, and threw
himfelf flat on his face, hoping to escape
the slash, but was so much burnt, that he
languished till Sunday afternoon, and then
died. The persons killed were, Mr. Key
fer, one of the proprietors of the works ;
a Mr. Carr, and a Mr. Miller, both young
men; and also one Mr. Bloom, a married
man, who has left behind a wife and five or
fix children, the wife being pregnant
The three persons last mentioned were in
the drying-house at work, where were
two tons of finifhed powder, which also
catching from the mill, although at a great
distance, blew up the whole building, darn
ed the people to pieces, burning them al
most to cinders, and not leaving a vestige
of the building on the spot. Mr. Keyiei
was at a spring near the mill, when a
piece of timber from some of the works
came and nearly took off his head. Mr.
Frailey was standing in the of a
fniall building near the centre of the whole,
and providentially received no hurt. A
coulin of Miss Frailey was close by hei
when she was struck, but received no in
jury. Thus, in a moment, as complete a
sett of works as any in the United State
were levelled to the groundâfive perfon>
hurried into eternity, and the fixch in a ve
ry dangerous situation. The wife and
family of Bloom being left in the molt in
digent circumstances, any charitable dona
tion for their life will be thankfully receiv
ed by Thomas Forrfl, F.fquire, in German
town, Mr. Nathan Levering, in Roxborow.
or Hilary Baker, Esquire, in Philadelphia.
" The Printers of the Daily, and othei
papers, in Philadelphia, will render an el
t'ential service to the distressed and be
reaved family of Bloom, by republifhing
the foregoing true state of facts, that the
charitable and benevolent, by being ac
quainted with their situation, may be in
duced to relieve them."
Other European advices, additional t;
those under our foreign heads, are reduccc
to the following abltract. Prelimina

The enemies of France were collecting fafl

ry species of military stores were daily ar
riving, and every appearance of a serious
attack upon France in a lliort timeâThe
Ruffian ambafTador to Poland had delivered

things, that the Kmpi'ef had ordered part

The supreme couit of the United States met
in this city on Monday lafl. It is said several
questions of magnitude arc agitating before the
courtat this time, aud such as include very ex
tensive importance.
[From Baltimore.]]
" THE time is fad approaching when
we (hall be called upon to fay, who lhall
represent us in the great national aflembly.
ro some this may appear a matter of small
moment, but to others it appears a matter
of the greareit importance, as in it our
welfare, as a nation, our respectability both
at home and abroad, nay our very liberties
as exilting in. our ltate government, are
materially involved.
If then it is a matter of such consequence
that we Ihould have virtuous and wife re
presentatives, let us diligently inspect the
abilities, wisdom, and integrity of those
who may offer themselves as candidates for
that high and honorable station.
The ltate of Maryland has hitherto been
fortunate in the choice of her representa
tives; abilities and virtue have hitherto
had a great influence upon the voice of the
people ; but how far or how long they may
continue to have their weight, is not in the
power of any man to fay. The great dan
gers arising from the powers veiled by the
conflitution in the executive branch of our
national government, are chiefly to be ap
prehended from the ignorance and corrup
tion of the representatives of the different.
Itates. If ever it once happen that the ma
jority of them are so weak in understand
ing, as to be led away by the artful and de
signing lchemes of the aristocratic few,
who, under the mail; of extending the pri
vilges.of the people, are laying the founda
tion of their own greatness ; or, if ever
once they become so venal, as that their
votes are capable of being purchased, fare
wel to American liberty ! Encroachments
on the Hate governments will immediately
ensue, and a confo'idation of the different
governments will be thedireft consequence.
These things may be objected to as scarce
ly pofflole of ever happening in this free and
enlightened country. Ala.. ! happy would
it be for mankind in general, if the hiltory
of patt nations (once as free and as enlight
ened as we are now) did not teltify the
contrary. Great-Britain is even at this ve
ry moment labouring under all the curses
of a government afflicted by the venality erf
its representatives. No sooner does an ac
tive, aspiring and ambitious man appear
on the popular fide, than he is immediately
darted at by the court party, who seldom
inifs their object, except he be something
mot e than mortal.
The great leading qualities of a repre
sentative ought to be wisdom and integrity.
If either of these are wanting, nothing can
compensate the loss. Riches, in a country
where all men are conltitutionally equal
(and where he who has no other quality to
recommend him ought to be despised even
111 common life) ihould have no weight in
the scale of a representative. When we
fee men possessed of this qualification, unac
quainted with any other, Italking forth and
offering themselves as proper objeÃs of the
confidence of the people, I would ailt what
heart throbs not svithin ? who can contain
himfelf? with how much propriety might
we cry out, in the language of Cicero,
0 Tcmpora, 0 Mores ? Nothing would ope
rate with me as a Stronger argument to
p: ove the degeneracy and low ltate into
which a nation was fallen, than to fee men
of the call I have above described, meet
wig with the least countenance from the
people.
l Y.efe sentiments, however absurd or im
proper they may seem to some, have yet
llovved from a pure and honorable source,
Amor Patrice. 1 have no other object in view
but to put you, my fellow-citizens, on your
guard agamft Jucfi men, if they do offer ;
and I trull that in so doing, you will {hew

[Intelligence from Baltimore, Augvfl 4.]
A gentleman of veracity, who arrived in
town late last evening, from Fort-Pitt, has
furmfhed us with the following melancholy
intelligence :âThat on Sunday lait a faith
ful Indian, that served under Gen. St.
Clair, and was taken on the 4th of Novem
ber last, had arrived thereâwho informed,
that all the c.miniiffioners (Major Truman,
of this state, Col. Hardin, of Kentucky, and
others sent out to invite the Indians ;u
treaty, were mafl'acred by them ; âthat a
Sergeant and 12 men, employed in making
hay, in the neighbourhood of Fort-Jefvr-
Son, were all cut offand that two light
horfeme , who were with them, barely es
caped into tbe fort,
It is mentioned In a letter fiom Columbia,
in Kentuckey, that the Indians continue to Heat
horses fiom the inhabitants, to as greatly to dis
tress the agriculture. Upwards of 3,000!. value
in horses is said to have been stolen since the fet
tling of this new country.
Venality and corruption are already Co
far advanced in this country, that, with
certain characters, it is thought impoffiblt:
lor a man in any the least degree connect
ed with government to ast, in other re
fpefts, from disinterested motives. Judging
from themselves, and what would be their
own conduct in a (imilar situation, they
luppofe every ast, word, and thought of
such a man must be rendered hypocritically
conformable to the ideas-os a fnppofed ma
jority in the government, which, according
to them, ought to maintain a complete so
vereignty over the minds of tho!e who may
have been appointed to the performance of",
r onje of its duties. When places and posts
are held 011 such conditions, and servility
becomes the leadirlg qualification, it may
easily be judged what will be the com
plexion of a government, and how far the
principles and motives of its various officers
are confident with the purity of a republi
can admiuiftration.

" The detil rageth when his time is

places present profpefts not at all to the
liking of thole who will probably be difapâ

" the government is in danger," has been
too often repeated to have much efifeft, the
people by aftiug for themselves, feeing with
their own eyes,_.,-nd hearing with their own
ears will,it is hoped,keep in proper fnbiefti
an influence that has long been gathering
strength to the prejudice of the country at

It is forefeen that the word mti federal will
be artfully used to prejudice the uninform

as the antifederal exifls in the United States.
It is a word without a representative in so
ciety, and only to be found in the mouths
of interested characters, or their humble
servants, who fear a change in certain mea
sures, in which they fuppole the ruin of
their own importance will be involved.

it would be Itrange indeed if those who

rfdd'efs 1f the Constitutional Society of Mancbefttr
in Engiand, to the Club of Jacobins in France
by their Deputation delivered on tbt lyb ci
Jpnl. J J
" Brothers and Friends,
_ <c E feci a lively fatisfaÂ£lion in communicat
ing to you the refulution by which our brethrer
Of the constitutional society of Manchester havi
appointed us their deputies to the patriotic socie
ties of Fiance. At the very moment when al
the despotic powers of Europe adt in concert t<
dertroy the cause of liberty, and to annihilate the
l ights of men, it will, no doubt, afford you plea
lure to know, that there exist every where (ever
in (hat country which the intrigues of Icings and
of courtiers have too often falfeiy represented a:
your enemies) men who ardently intefeft them-
Selves in your cause, not only as the cause ol
Frenchmen, but as the cause of all mankind,
" The lights which you have diffufed over the
true principles of politics, are the natural right!
of men, lights, which, from the judicious pofiti
c-n you have exhibited them in, 'begin to fnine
more brightly in England, and which ought to
convince us, that the time is come to abolish all
national prejudices, and to embrace as brothers,
free, men of all nations. Too long have the arti
fices of despots opposed themselves to nature, they
have falfeiy taught men to regard each other as
enemies.
" Addrefling the club of the Jacobins, not
merely as friends to the French conflitution, but
under the still more refpeftable name of frier,ds to
mankind, we fo.icit on behalf of the constitution
al society of Manchester, an amicable communi
cation and correspondence with them, as the con
tinuation at least, if not as the commencement,
of that general federation amongst the patriotic
societies of Europe, whose sole objefl is the pater
nal union of men. Our society will rejoice to
unite its efforts with yours, to spread abroad those
important principles of oniverfal liberty, which
alone can fix, on a firm and immoveable basis,
the empire of peace and the happiness of man
kind.
" We congratulate the Jacobin club on the in
voluntary homage which one of the despotic
courts of Europe has already rendered them, by
pointing them out as the most determined enemies
of arbitrary power.
_ " Pursue, gentlemen, your glorious philanthro
pic cause, and continue to deserve at once the ex
ecrations of tyrants, and the bleliings of the reft
of the human race !
(Signed) Thomas Cooper,
James Watt."
â¢' This address was received with unbounded
applause at every paragraph ; and the Prefidei.i
(M. De Carra, who tovk the chair as Vice-Prefi
dei.t, in the ablence of the focietj's Preliden:)
returned the following answer :
" Brethren and Friends,
" It is juff a century fn-.ce the English afforded
a glorious example to the universe, in humbling
the despotic piide of kings, and exhibiting the
iii ft glimpse of a declaration of the rights of mar
in their constitutional charter. At that time tin
other nations of the globs were surrounded with
the thick clouds of ignorance, and bent down un
der the galling yoke of the mofMhameful slavery.
At this day the Fiench have imitated it with a
degree of perfection, which it was certainly not
then poffiDle for you to attain ; their fuperioi
lyccefs arising from the natural and successive
projjrela of liuman reason.
<c Atthis day, it is th; English again, who
commence the general alliance of all nationj, an
a..iance which, we may reft aflured, will shortly
make one family of the whole human race. Yes,
brethren and friends ! the Englifli and the French
henceforward, and forever, united by the ties oi
justice and humanity, and the most tender affec
tion, will fight together as brothe.s, for the sup
port of their common liberty, and for the amelio
ration of their refpedive governments.
tf In vain the ebullition of despotic rage, a
mong the tyrants of Europe, flatters itfeJf as for
merly, to fee nations against nations, thereby to
augment the number of their slaves, or to gratify
their revenge. Ihe hour of these errors, and of
illusion, has patted away. National animosities,
fomented by the intrigues and imposture of courts,
are beginning to be extinguished. The French
people, the french loldiers, and the sailors, now
behold none but brethren among the fame clafTes
of the Engliih, whom they earnestly desire to em
brace, and contradl with them upon the pure gos
pel of the rights of man, an eternal compadt oi
concord and peace. Already the Englifli flag, re
united and entwined with the three-coloured
of France, and the starry flag of the brave Amer
icans, is fulpended from the roofs of almost eve
ry patriotic locieiy in France j already numerous
civic feafts have been ceiebrated, in almost ever)
department of this empire, consecrating the alli
ance which we have sworn to observe with all th
patriots of England, in the person of the deputici
of the celebrated town of Manchester.
<l Friends ! tell your fellow citizens âtell youi
countrymenâtnofe men whom the genius of in
dustry and of patriotism have rendered so praise
worthy, and fodear to every jover of the arts, of
commerce, and of humanityâtell them ! you
have here beheld Frenchmen, whose natural char
acter has long been kept under by slavery, but
now arisen and displayed bv the most energetic
sense of their lights and of "their libertyâbreath
ing philanthropy, looking upon all mankind as
brethren, upon every people as their iclations-
Tell them, that our courage, and our perfeverancc,
are not to be surmounted, andrthat we are detei
mined to aup to the oath we have taken, to
LIVE FREE, OR DIE.
" Tell them again, though the tyrants of Eu
rope redouble their rage, that the politics of ths
true patriots of France, of the Jacobins, to dread
ed by the traitors and enemies of liberty, do no'
consist in desiring the glory and the prosperity ol
the countries which gave them birth, but'the
profpfrity and the liberty of every nation upon
earth. \ es, this is the perpetual unremitting ob
jett of the French Jacobins, that is, of a very
great majority of the whole nation ; and in virtue
of this happy disposition, the friends of the con
stitution at Paris, in this our name, arid in the
name of all the patriotic societies of the Frcnch
empire, tie themselves bj- an invariable promi ft
to the conft:tutionaJ society of Manchester.
" 1 his aflembly invites you to aflift at their
fittings during the whole of your stay at Paris.
The society, on ordering these two fpeeehes to
be printed, also ordered copies of them to be sent
to all its affiliated societies, as also to the consti
tutional society at Manchester, the 13th of April,
I 791, in the fourth year of liberty.
