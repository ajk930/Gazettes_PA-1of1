RULES
For changing a limited Republican Govern
ment into an unlimited hereditary one.
[Continuedfrom our lafl.j
IX.'T' H E management of a great
X funded debt and an extensive
fyflem of taxes will afford a plea not to
benegle&ed, for eflablifliing a great in
corporated bank The use of such a ma
chine is w'l und rilood. If the coafti
tution, according to its fair meaning,
should not authorize it, so n uch the bet
ter. Pu<h it through by a forced mean
ing, and you will get in the bargain an
admirable precedent for future m.lcon
ftruclions. In falhioning the bank re
member that it is to be made particular
ly instrumental in enriching and aggran
dizing the cleft f v/, who are to be called
in due season to the honors and felicities
of the kingdom preparing for them ; and
who aÂ»e the pillars that mull support it.
It wil be easy to throw the benefit en
tirely into their hands, anJ to make it a
solid addition of 50, or Go, or 70 per
centc to their former capitals of 800 per
cent, or 900 per crnt. without colling
them a shilling; whilst it will be so
difficult to explain to the peopl â¢ that this
gain of the few is at the colt of the many,
that t'"e contrary may be boldly and fafely
pr tended. The bank will be pregnant
with other important advantages. It
will admit the fame men to he, at the
fame time, members of the bank and
mem ers of the government. The two
inltitu 10ns will thus be foldere i togethei,
and each midethe stronger Money will
he out under the direction of the govern
mem, and the government under th â¢ di
rection of money. To crown the whole,
the bank will have a ptoper interest in
fuelling and perpetuating the public debt
and public taxes, with all the bh flings of
both, because its agency and its profits
will be extended in cxaft proportion.
X " Divide and govern" is a maxim
consecrated by the experience of ages,
and should be as familiar in its use to
every politician as the knife he carrie s in
his pocket. In the wotk here to be ex
ecuted the bed effects may be produced
by this maxim, and with peculiar faci
lity. An extensive republic made up of
lesser republics, nectffarily contains vari
ous forts of people, diflinguifhed by local
and other interefls and prejudices. Let
the whole groupe be well examined in all
its parts and relations, geographical and
political, metaphysical and metaphorical ;
Jet there be firll a northern and a south.
ern fedtion by a line runnir. east and weft,
and then an eastern and western feftion,
by aline tunning north and south. By a
suitable nomenclature, the landholders
cultivating different article.? can be dis
criminated from one another, all from
the class of merchants, and both from
that of manufacturers. One of the sub
ordinate republics may be represented as
a commercial (late, another as a naviga
tion (late, another as a manufacturing
state, o hers as agricultural slate-,; and
although the great body of the people
in each be really agricultural, and the
other charafteis he more or less com
mon to all, ftili it will be politic to ta.ie
advantage of such an arrangement. Should
the mem! ers of the great republic be of
different size , and fubjeft to little jea
lousies on that account, another impor
tant division will be ready formed to your
hand. Add again the divisions that
triay be carved out of personal interejls,
political opinions, and local parties.â
With so convenient an aflortment of votes,
especially with the he'p of the marked
enes, a majority may be packed for any
cjueftion with as much ease as the odd
trick by an adroit gamcfter, and any
measure whatever be carried or defeated,

about, may require. It is only necessary
herefore, to recommend that full use b:
nade of the resource : and to remark
â  hat, befidcs the direA benefi: to be
drawn from these artifl ial divisions, they
ill tend to [mother the true and natural
one, exilting in all iocieties between the
L-w who are always impatient of political
equality, and the many who can never
ife above it; between thole who are to
mount to the prerogatives, and those
who are to be saddled with the burthens,
of th.- here iitary government to be in
troduced ; in one word, between the ge
neral ma's or the people, attached to
heir republican government and repub
lican interetts, and the chosen band de
voted to monarchy and mammon. It is
of infinite importance that ihis distinCtion
should be kept out of fight. The fuc
cess of the project absolutely requires it.
XI. As soon as fufScient progress in
the intended cha ge (hall have been made,
and the public mind duly prepared, ac
cording to the rules already laid down, it
will be proper to venture on another and
a bolder step towards a removal of the
conilituti nal land-marks Here the aid
of the former encroachments, and all the
other precedents and way paving ma
noeuvres wiil be called in of course. But,
in order to render success the more cer
tain, it w 11 be of special moment to give
the molt plausible an.l po ular name that
can be found, to the power that is to be
usurped. It may be called, for exam
ple, a power for the common fafety or
the public good, or, " the general wel
[are." If tht people fhou'd noi be ton
much enlightened, the name will have a
molt irapofing effedt. It will escape at
tention that i: means, in faÂ£t, the fame
thing with a power to do any thing the
government pleases " in all caf s wlutfo
ever." To opp >fe the power may con
sequently seem to the ignorant, be
called by the artful, opposing the " gene
ral welfare," and may be cried down un
der that deception. As the people, how
ever, may not tun so readily into the
snare as might be wifhe I, it will be pru
dent to bait it well with some specious
popular interelt. such as the encourage
ment of manufactures, or even of agri
culture ; taking due care not even to
mention any unpopular object to which
the power is equally applicable, such as
religion, &c. &c. See. By this contri
vance, particular clafTcs of people may
poffibiy be taken in, who will be a valu
able reinforcement. With refpeft to the
patronage of agriculture, there is not in
deed much to be expected from it. It
will be too quickly seen through by the
owners and tillers of the foil, that to tax
them with one hand and payback a part
only with the other, is a losing game on
their fide, i'Yom the power over manu
factures more is to be hoped. It will no;
be so ealily perceived that the premium
belloweJ may not be equal to the cir
cuitous tax on consumption, which pays
it. There are particular realons, too,
for pushing the experiment on th s clals
of citizens. I. As they live in towns
and can ast together, it is ci vast confe
q'lence to gain them over to the interest
of monarchy. 2 If the power over them
be once eitablifhed, the government can
grant favours or monopolies as it pleases ;
can raifeordeprefs this or that place, as it
pleases; can gratify this or that individual,
as itpleafes; in a word, by creating a depend
ence in so numerous and important a class of
citizens, it will increase its own indepen
dence of every class, and be more free to
pursue the grand object in contemplation.
3. The expence of this operation will not
n the end colt the government a shilling ;
for the moment any branch of rr.anufac
ture has been brought to a {late of tolera
ble maturity, the exciftmm will be ready
with his conltable and his search-warrant
to demand a reimbursement, and r.s much
more as can be squeezed out of the r.rti
cle. A.ll this, it 13 to be remembered
luppofes that the * -.amifaflÃrers will lÂ»c
we a k enough to be cheated, i:i f,me re
spects, out of their own interefis, and
wicked enough, in others, to betray ihofe
of their fallow citizens ; a luppotition
that, if known, wouid totally mÂ»r the
experiment. Great care, therefore, must
be taken to present it from leaking out.
XII. The expediency of seizing every
occasion of external danger for sugment
; â¢â¢ni perp?ti>:it ng the (land ing milita
ry force, is tÂ»p obvious to escape. So
important is this matter, that for any loss
t>r dil.ift.er whatever attending the na
tional arm 3, there will be ample consola
tion and compensation in the opportuni
:y tor enlarging the ella dilhment. A
nilitary defeat will become a political
/i&o y, and the loss of a little vulgar
Mood contributes to ennoble 'hat which
lows in the veins of our future dakes and
narquiffes
XIII. The fame prudence will im
prove the opportunity afforded by an in
;reafe of the military expen litures, for
serpetuating the taxes required for them,
if the inconfiften :y and a'ofurd ty of eftÂ« -
bflifhing a perpetual tax for a temporary
ervice Ihould produce any difficulty in the
Â«uinefs, Rail 10 mull be resorted to
Throw in a; many extraneous motives as
will make up a majority, and the thing
is effected in rn inltant. Wlia: was be
fore evil will become goad as easily as
ilack coul 1 be made white by the fame
magical operation,
XIV. Throughout this great under
taking it wilt be wife to have some parti
cular model constantly in view. The
A-ork can then be carried on more fyfte
naticallv, and every measure be fortified,
irt the pr grefs, by apt illu(lration3 and
mthorities Should there exist a parti
cular monarchy against which thete are
ewer prejudices than against any other:
Should it contain a mixture of the repre
ntative principle so as to present on one
ide the semblance of a republican aipeft ;
hould it moreover have a great, funded
complicated, irredeemable debt, with all
heapparatus and appurtenanccs ofexcifes,
janks, &c. See. &c upon that a steady
tye is to be kept. In all caf.s it will as
ill, and in mod its statute book wi 1 fur
nifh a precise pattern by which there may
t>e cut out any monied or monarchical
jrojeft that may be wanted-
XV. As it is not to be expe&ed that
he change of a republic into a monarchy,
.vith the rapidity desired, can be carried
through without occasional suspicions and
jlarms, it will be neceflary to be prepared
"or such events. The bell general rule

charging every man who wiiifpers, or even

tcrated and reverberated till at lad fuel
:onftrfion and uncertainty be produced,
that the people being not able to find ou!
nrhere the truth lies, withdraw their at
tention from the contest.
Many other rules of great wisdom and
efficacy might be added : but it is con
ceived that the above will be abundantly
enough for the purpole. This will cer
taiuly be the cafe, if the people can be ei
therkept afleepfo as not to difcovcr, or be
thrown into artificial divisions, so as not
refill what is silently going f rward â
Should it be found impoffible,however, to
prevent the people from awaking and

give way to the natural div/iion between

On the Disadvantage of CANALS.
[ From an Englijh Publication.]
AMONG other causes of the great
advance in the price of provisions, ot late
years, may be justly reckoned the many
long and large canals which are continu
ally cutting through this island, whereby
very much land is occupied, and a large
part of it the best arable or pallure land.
It is true the keeping of many horses is
Lved'by this method of conveying goods ;
but whether so m ny as cwrrpenfate for
the land employed in them, and the in -
jury done to improved lands through
which they are digge 1, is a queflion wor
thy of attentive enquiry. Dotibtlefs, by
means of canals, the price of land-carri
age is greatly lowered, and, in a mode
rate number, they mnft be a national be
nefit ; but wha:, under proper restric
tions, may be great national benefits,
may become evil* if injudiciously indul
ged. It is no trifling matter to cut up a
fruitful country in canal?, efpeciaily
where the population is increasing, and
where large manufactures demand much
land for their support, as do its inhabi
tants for neceflary food, firing, &c. nor
fliould it be allowed for trifling ccnfider
ations or the interelt of individuals who
may adventure their money in these
greit undertakings. It is not only the
loss of the land taken up in the ca
nals, and the roads for the draft horses
on their fides ; but so far from their banks
as cultivated land can be drained by them,
it mud be less fruitful, as is observable on
the fides of rivers. Brooks also being
sometimes diverted from their natutal
courses to supply the canals, rauH he pre
vented from overflowing the land through
which they run, which may render it
!cfs fruitful ; and water from fpn'ngs may
be so drawn away as greatly to injure dai
ry or grazing farms. The streams of
some parts of >ivers may also be so weak
ened by brooks which were wont to uia
in to them being turned to feed the ca
nals, as to hurt the navigation upon them.
In these national works every circum-
Piance which may be injurious, as well as
:hofe which may promise to be advan
tageous, fliould be well conlidered, and
rood land not be fuffered to be cut up
aut for valid reasons.
FOR the NATIONAL GAZETTE*
Mr. Fr PNEAtT,
SINCE the existence of the federal go
vernme.it, I have not ceased to solicit of
:he representatives of the people an effec
tual system, conformably to the Conftitu
:ion, for promoting the progress of ufeful
irts, by securing to original inventors, pro
oerty in their refpefcive discoveries.
The justice, policy, and utility of fecur
ng mental, equally with local property, I
have long urged.
Notwithstanding all my effort?, added to
to the efforts of others, relative to the fub
eÂ£t, the objeÂ£t is not yet obtained.
Whether, from the novelty of the idea of
i system for feturing mental property ;*
jr, from a want of right information rela
tive to the mental rights of men, or their
igiits in the prcdufts of their genius ; or,
rom a too zealous disposition to do right,
hey have done wrong, or in other words,
'ejl they should secure too much, they have
lot, determinately, secured any property in
discoveries; or, partly from the Whole, or
from other latent causes, 1 am, indeed, loft
in conjecture ; âBut, it is, not only, an ac
knowledged fait, by all enlightened men
who have attended to the object, but too
dearly experienced by some on whom it
operates, to witâthat the effect of the ex
iting patent system is, indeed, infinitely
worse than none.
Being determined to porfevere in solicit
ing the deputies of the people, so long as I
am capable of speaking or of writing, till
the object flia.ll be obtained ; and, also, in
the meanwhile, to diffufe as nuich as pofli
ble, any ideas, or matter which occurs to
me, or of which I may from time to time
be poffefled, which will tend to throw light
on the fubjeft ; I am, of consequence, hap
py in having it in my power, and cheerfully

up trreir own dogmas as tiie infallible creed
of polit.cal oiihodoxy, yet condemn all,
who differ from them, as fools or knaves."
Such conduct would be highly irrational and
liable t>> merited reproach. But when I de

abides of the eoniiitut'on.letme not be con
sidered an enemy.o it, or a foot or a knave, and
reprobated a.id abused lucli by writers
who feeni dilpoied to flatter any and every

Since tne ph.ale " Enemies of the conftitu

\v>th some ; let us, for 011 c?, enquire who,
1:1 reality, and what are these enemies of
tiie conftitiition ?
It is anlwered, enemies to the conftitu
t,oll of the United States may be of two
forts ; Oil one fide those who are enemies to
tne union, and wilh todeftroy the conllitu
t:ou which lupports it ; 011 the other fide,
enemies to republican government who

ing and twilling it into a monarchy. Hap

In k fore, they are so few and of so little
weight tha: they do not avow therufelves.
Uifunion and anarchy are doctrines both
unpopular and unfa.hionabie. They are
no wnere, nor by any body allowed to be
right and good They are equally con
demned by tne language at a country ta
vei 11 and a city feait.âMuch is il to be de
plored that the fame cannot be laid of the
danger 0.1 the other iide, and that a fac
tion is in being, some of whom openiy,
onier.! more coverrty. preach doctrines that
ftnke ai tne root oi ad republican govern
ment. Ii tiie fact be doubted, took Lack tc
a train of pubneation and paragraphs for
.Several year., in a certain n ujpaper, which

government is the free ftibjea of eon. erfa

it is ail evalion, and a very fiily one,
not a'i aufwer to the charges which have
teemed agannt (peculating members of the
government, to -plead that there are some of
tae executive no wile involved 111 paper-job
bing ; as if we had already got the Britilli
government among us, wnere government
means that over-ruling branch of it only,
a,id nor, a> here, the whole jrovernment;
or, as if ,t ha.l ever been supposed that all
the men/oers of any part of tne government
had gone astray.
Tiioie who desire to put their finger on
the particular members of the government,
who have Speculated in their own measures,
if tiiey cannot make the discovery by more
o.enable mark;, may consult the books in
the public othces, but particularly the Jub-
Jcription books of the bankâ  Should the brokers
be civil enough to open their books also and
explain th ni, it is probable further light will
be '.11. own on the enquiry.

commonly supposed, to feature our govern

cny, it doe. not Seem difficult to Solve the
phenomenon. 1. A touliderable number
of ruem are now Britiih Subjects, and of
eumfeprefer monarchy to a republic. 2.Ha
virig made fortunes out of measures copied
from theSritlhadininUtration,their attach
ment ealily links their gains with that ad
m niitration, and proceeds from the admi
nistration to the government. 3. In the
Uritiiii government the moneyed intereit is
the favante a.id the ruling intereit. The mo
med interest here may consequently expect,
by likening odr government to the Britiih,
to get a itronger tenure than they begin
now to have, to theirfavorite and ruling cha
racter with the government. So that ava
rice and ambition n ay not claih, but con
cur, in tiiis cafe. 4. Sudden and fplendic
wealth is but too apt to generate vanity anc
nfolence, a state of the mind very unfriend
ly to republican ideas. 5. Where fuc!
rortunes happen to be made without an)
ufeful industry or laucWole purluit, anc
(till more if made by unjust or rapaciou
means, the pofielibrs become obnoxious tc
popular odium. Hatred begets hatred.
And those who hate tue people are preparec
.0 hate a government of the people.
These observations may account for ar
extraordinary biafs in the great certificate
and scrip-dealers, to favour measures fub
verlive of the constitution. They are tc
be conlidered as enemies to it, not in fa
vor qf disunion and convullion,which woulc
not 111 it their purpofrs : but in favour ot ;
progredive adminijlration of it into a monarchy,
which would ticicle all their palfioas.
A government and its measures (houlc
never be confounded. As a man may be â¢
friend to a government, and an enem;
to its measures ; so he may be a frienc
to the measures and an enemy to th<
government. If the government be re
publican, and the measures tend to changt
it into a monarchy, a friend to monarch;
mult be an enemy to the government in ex
ast proportion as he is attached to its mea

On Sunday, the 17th of May, the go

notice. They instant y determined tt
receive him with all the honors they couk
demonstrate, and requelled that he woulc

him of their readiness. The chiefs anc
Indians of every description, fuppoled tc

drawn tip in two lines, each extending a
bout three hundred yards, leaving an opet
space, through which the governor anc
his honorary escort, commanded by majm

will be realized.

At the close of the conference, Genera!

French Revolution, and consequently reai
friends to the revolution in America.
The following, among other patriotic
republican toasts, was lately drank at a mi
litary exhibition in the state of Vermont.
" May the American states be long defend
ed from the inundation which is threaten
ed by the increase of aristocrats, who wish
for a rich metropolis and a poor peasantry ;
want a great personage's head 011 the cur
rent coin ; and are advocates for keeping
shut the doors of the Senate."
On Saturd y last some boys bathing in a
pond near this c'tv, one of them wandering
from the refl, funk into a deep hole and dis
appeared. After laying under water about
twenty minutes he was at length taken up,
to all appearance dead. By rubbing him
with fait, however, in less than twenty mi
nutes the body exhibited ligns of reanima
tion : in about three hours more he wasfo
far recovered as to turn himfelf in the bed,
and in a day or two was perfectly well.
Our accounts further fay, that before the
usual methods of recovery were tried, the
body had every appearance of being lifelefs;
and many fuppoled that a total suspension
of the animal functions had taken place.
A letter from Cape Francois, dated June
19, contains the following paragraphâ" It
is my opinion that this colony is infallibly
verging to total ruin and destruction : the
infurreftion f'preads daily, ar.d the troops
that have arrived are under no command,
and die very fall. Of 350 of Dillon's bri
gade that were Tent to Fort Dauphin, there
now remain only 30 able to carry arms, and
about 150 are dead.
The final abolition of the African slave
trade is determined on by the government
of Denmark, as far as concerns themselves.
To avoid the disadvantage, however, of too
udden a change in that trade, its final abo
lition is not to take place for ten years, that
is t.II Jan. 1, 1803: during which time eve
ry means is to be used to encourage breed
ing negroes in their colonies, and to eftablifli
such laws as may be of mutual benefit to
the blacks and whites. After the expira
t on of the time above mentioned, no Da
niihfubjeÂ£l will be permitted to carry on
the slave trade in any shape whatever.
" Upon a late occasion a worse than F,n
glifhelechon took place in the towns of Ot
fego and Milton. The number of freeholder?
was by some miraculous power increased
beyond credibility. Boys were converted
into menâthe transient stranger acquired
a sudden residence, and the pauper became
in an instant a substantial freeholder. "A
faÂ£t transpired on the canvass, which is a
remarkable instance of the wicked arts prac
ticed to destroy the freedom of fuffrage. It
is thisâMr. V. R. candidate for the office
of Lieutenant-Governor, was one of the
infpeftors of the election in the town of
Water-Vliet, chiefly inhabited by his te
nants. In order to prevent them from vot
ing against Mr. Jay and himfelf, and to mark
out for vengeance those that had the auda
city to oppose his inclination, he procured
a peculiar kind of silk paper, with which the
ballots were formed, by which means, and
his official station as infpeftor, he was able
to teli immediately whether his unfortunate
tenants had voted their landlord for Lieu
tenant-Governor. N. York Journalâ 
The {ticklers for the perfection, infalli
bility, and immaculate purity of govern
ment (hould bear with some degree of pa
tience the opinions of those who are not so
entirely convinced as themselves, and ex
cuse thein if now and then they seem a little
disconcerted at observing what all but blind
men must observe, the farce, or rather the
tragedy, of certain European systems, en
deavoring, by some, to be afred over again
in this country : systems which have, in the
old world, bowed down the mars of the peo

attended with the fame effects in America,
by gradual advances, if the people are not

A squall visited New-York last Sunday
afternoon at nearly the fame time as here ;
near thirty persons were drowned in conse
quence thereof, men, women, and children
that were taking their pleasure on the river.
Repots were in circulation of many other
persons being loft, by the oversetting of
boats. Much damage, it is said, was also
done to houses and orchards. "Itis a me
lancholy reflexion (f:.ys a New-York paper)
to consider the number of persons drowned
every year in taking their pleasure on the
Sabbath."âPossibly with the person that
made this pious reflexion, Sunday is the
only busy day in the week.
In the months of April, May nnd June,

English papers as late as the 30th of April
(received by Captain Norton, from Liver

agaiuft the King of Hungary and Bohemia,
was formally proclaimed throughout Paris,
on the 21ft, amidst the greatell concourse of
people ever seen on such an occasionâThat
the Ruffian fleet would pass the found in a
few days, and rendezvous either in the
Downs or at Torbay ; but none of the Bri

receptionâThat the French commerce was
likely to futfer in the contest, as privateers
from various states would rendezvous at
Oflend, and failing under Brabant colours,
would pick up the merchant (hips of France
âbut that great preparations were making
in France, for the immediate capture of
that place.
Every recent letter from Spain brings
some new instance of the growing spirit of
revolt in that country. It firfl manifeftcd
itfelf in Catalonia, where the hardy disposi

and if the recita's which have reached us,
be well founded, Despotism and the Inqui

the press, making evident encroachments
upon the general diflemination of literature
and that knowledge of the proceedings of
government, with which every freeman has
a right to be acquainted. While the state
papers can be kept in afquabble about cor
poration matters, and matters of little mo
ment to the great interests of the union ;
and while such impositions can be laid on
free papers printed at the feat of govern

their general circulation, the public can
have little else to expect, than a continua

keeps {hut the doors of the Senate, and has

make the constitution speak a language to
which it is an utter stranger, for purpofej

Governmental Combinations, and Abuses.
[From Mr. Fame's Rights of Man. ]
AS a new fydem is now opening to the
view of the world, the European courts are
plotting to counteract it. Alliances, con
trary to all former fyllems, are agitating,
and a common intered of courts is forming
againd the common intered o! man. Thi.
combination drawsa line that rims through
out Europe, and presents a cause so entire
ly new, as to exclude all calculat.ons from
fonner circumllances. While despotism
warred with despotism, man had no inter
ed in die conted ; but in a cause that unites
the soldier with the citizen, and nation with
nation, the despotism of courts, though it
feels the danger, and meditates revenge, i
afraid to drike.
No qttedion has arisen within the record
of hidory that prefied with the importance
of the present. It is not whether this 01
that party (hall be in or out, or whig or to
ry, or high or low fljall prevail; but whe
ther man (hall inherit his rights, and uni
versal civilization take place ? Whether the
fruits of his labours (hali be enjoyed by him
felf, or consumed by the profligacy of go
vernments? Whether robbery ihall be ba
nilhed from courts, and wretchedness froir
countries ?
When, in countries that are called civil
ized, we fee age going to the workhouse
and youth to'the gallows, something mtifl
be wrong in the fyttem of government. It
would leem, by the exterior appearance o*
such countries, that all was happiness ; but
tli"relies hidden from the eye of common
observation, a mass of wretchedness that
has scarcely any other chance, than to ex
pire in poverty or infamy. Its entrance
into life is market! with the prefageofits
fate ; and until this is remedied, it is in vain
to punish.
Civil government does not consist in exe
cutions ; but in making such provision for
the ihftru&ion of youth, and the support of
age, as to exclude, as much as possible, prof
hu, cv from tfce one, and despair from the
other. Instead of this, the refourcesofa
country are lavilhed upon kinrs,upon courts,
upon hirelings, impostors, and prostitutes ;
and even the poor themselves, with all their
wants upon them, are compelled to support
the fraud that opprefles them.
Why is it, that scarcely any are executed
but the poor ? The faÂ£t is a proof, among
other things, of a wretchedness in their con
dition. Bred up without morals, and cast
upon the world without a profpeft, they
are the exposed facrifice of vice and legal
barbarity. The millions that are fuperflu
oufly wafted upon governments, are more
than fufficient to reform those evils, and to
benefit the condition of every man in a na
tion, not included within the purlieus of a
court.
The following Iketches on the present mi
serable condition of the poor in England
are extracted from the Journal of a sen
sible Quaker; who has lately travelled
through that country, and whose veraci
ty may be relied on.â
"A TRAVELLER through those po
pulous counties wherein the iron, and
other manufafloriesare eftabliihed. observ
ing the very great number of cottages on
the fides of commons which lie contiguous
to them, cannot admire at the riots occa
lioned by enclosing them. Many of their
inhabitants, perhaps their predecefiors for
ages back, have been accustomed to look
upon them as their own, exclusive of a
finail rent paid to the lord."; and to be at
once deprived of them, and be obliged to
seek an habitation they know not where,
and if procured to give an high rent, is
cruel. Small tenements, in many parifl es,
are now become scarce, divers families
live in one house, yea, a single room inuft
serve a large family ; so that the health of
the poor is endangered by so many of them
being crowded together ; and when putrid
disorders attack them, probably many lives
are loft by it. It is (hocking to humanity
for the dead corpse of an husband to lie 011
the fame bed (if it may be called a bed)
with a sick wife, and perhaps several chil
dren. Yet many such instances there are
in this rich and proud nation ; and x.vhere
is the humanity (it may jnftly bequi ricd)
jf the government, when they pass e nclo
ing laws, without prctefting the pojrcot
:agers ?"
" The estates are generally in the hands
jf farmers, and it is no uncommon thing
:or one farmer to rent from three to five
iiundied pounds per annum. As the plarifh
;s are mostly small, three or lour capital
farmers frequently occupy almost all the
?ftatesin one of them : and as by tl.e tenot
;>f their leases, they pay all parish ra'rs and
:axes, they conclude it their interest that a<
ew poor labourers as may be, dwell in theit
efpe&ive parishes ; and therefore, as forne
jf the labourers have told me, they have
ufi'ered as many small cot-houses, which
ivere on their estates, as they coul'J, to sal
own, rather than they Ihould be occupiec
jypoor families : always chufingthat theit
abourers Ihould live in an adjoining parish,
â¢ather than their own, giving for a reason.
hat if any misfortune Ihould happen tc
:hem, their estates would not be burthenec
with supporting them."
" In most parts of England, the people are
ibfolutely in a state of vallalage to their
â¢igh and mighty mafterv, for whom they la
jour for about fix /hillings pir week. I
jelieve the farmers, at least some of them,
ell corn to their labourers for what they
rail reasonable prices. They scarcely taste
1 bit of animal food, except bacon, which
hey buy of their masters for seven pence per
lound, and every other article'of life is pto-
Dot tionabiy dear. The best produce of the
..ountry is carried off to the towns, or ex
ported ; even their fuel, though in many
parts plenty, is dear. The milk, that r.e
:effary food for poor families, is chiefly
made into cheese: the poor have seldom
my. The best of the cheese is sent away,
and an inferior fort made for thein, and
fold at a high price. There fjemed to me
to be a visible depreflion in the countenan
ces of these poor creatures. I have seen
them approach their masters with all
the appearance of abject fear and flattery ;
but could never discover any thing like af
fection, or an attachment to their master's
person or property, further than outward
(how, the effect of slavish fear. In fhort,the
Engiifh peafantrv appeared to me almost
every where, to be in a very uncomfortable
state. >'â[The American reader will make his own

GOVERNMENTS and states have fome
thinginthem so analogous to a ship and

forded conflar.t occasion of allegorical com
parison. Horace, in his time, compared
the Roman empire to a veflel tofied in a
storm at a sea, and intimates it would have
been much better that Hie had continued
in the quiet port of republican] fm, than
have ventured out on the boisterous ele
ment of royalty.âl do not recolleÂ£t, how
ever, that any author has considered the
comparison in the following point of view.
There is no (hip, nor veflel of any kind but
is more or less peftercd with leaks, which
are in some degree necefl'ary to keep the
(hip fweet; âneither is there any govern
ment but isconftantly infected with abuses
and encroachments of a nature more or less
considerable, and more or less dangerous to
the liberties of the people.âThe leaks in a
ship, tho'ever so trifling, became fatal in a
tew days faiiing, if the pumps are not duly
jogged : if these be neglected'f'ie soon be
comes water-logged, and perilhes in the
next gale of wind with all her crewâgo
vernments are liable to the fame danger, of
political foundering, if free printing prefles
(like the pump on Clipboard) are not work

NEW-YORK, July 4.
As much pains has been taken 10 irnprclsan
opinion upon Ihe public mind, that the failure of
~ir' 1,1 'he election for governor, is entire
y afcribable to the lols of the Otfego votes, it
nnay not be improper to submit the following
latement to the public :
1 f all ihe votes had been canvsifled, it is highly
probable, that Gov. Clinton would have had a
larger majority rhan he now has : He loft 300
rotes in Orange and Richmond. From the belt
nlormation, two of the rejected counties, Clin
:on and Tioga, would have, at leaff, turned out
i majority of 10c in his favor.

alcm and Genelec, which gave seventy votes,
ivere also supposed to affo:d him a majority oi 50.

Mr. Clinton, if all the votes had been counted.
1 his flatement has been made upon the pre
umption, that all the votes, given, in favot of
Mr. Jay, were fair and bona fideâThe contra
â¢y, however, is mod evidently the cafe. Ifiin
>ofition had not been piaÂ£lifed, in Otfego, there
s no doubt Mr. Clinton would have had a
majority in the county of that name. That
own has bee fettled only within a few yeais,
ind upon the moll liberal calculation it cannot
produce more than 3CO votes, whereas by ini
quitous fraud it turned out nearly 6co.
The town of Harper's Field was almofl:
unanimously in favor of Mr. Clinton, and
it'furniihed two hundred ele&ors.
The town of Cherry Valley also contain
ed a considerable majority for him, which
added to Harper's Field, and a diver/ion in
his favor, in the town of Otfego, would
have given Mr. Jay, only about a.majorify of
joo, notwithstanding the three hundred dis
honest votes in the town last ment oned.
But after the town officers h 'd been re
gularly chosen, in Cherry Valley, Mr. Eli
Parsons (one of the leaders of the infur
ients, in Maflachufetts, and who is a warm
fayite, and the intimate friend of the virtu
wjudge Cooper) followed by a small fac
:ion, occasioned the choice of others, by
which mean ; there were two sets of town
officers, and inspectors of the election, in

Parson's poll, being favorable to Mr. Jay,

had been canvafled, Mr. Jay would, per
haps, have had a majority of 4CO, in Otfego

LIT Tome in grog place their delight,
O'er butled por'.er waste the night,
Or sip the rosy wine,
A dift of tea
More pleases me,
YielJs fofcer joys ,
Provokes less noise,
And breeds no base defrgn.
China's clime, this present broughf,
Enlivens every power of thought
Rigs many a (hip for sea,
Old maids it warms
Young widows, charms,
And miifes' men
Not one in ten
Cut courts them for their tea.
When throbbing pains afTai 1 my head
And dullness o'er my brain is spread,
The muse no longer kind,
A single sip
Dispels the hyp :
To chsfe the gloo m
Fresh spirits come
The flood-tide of the mind.â
When worn wirh toil, or vext with care
Let Susan but this draught prepare
And I forget my pain j
This magic bowl
Revives the foul,
With gentle sway
Bids care be gay,
Nor mounts to cioud the brain.
If learned men the truth would speak
They prize it far beyond their Greek,
Mor* fond attention pay :
No Hebrew root
So well can suit,
More quickly taught,
Lei's dearly bought,
And studied twice a day-
This leaf from distant regions sprung
Puts life into tbe female tongue
And aids the cause of love.
Such power has tea
O'er bond and frer,
Which priests admire,
Delights the Yqutre
And Galen's sons approve.
On Partial Attachments to Country.
TT has often been remarked by travellers who
_|_ have visited this country, that the Americans
a; j less national than any other people j which ob
servation is undoubtedly pretty generally true.
There leems to be a natural propenlity in almost
every human being to think more favorably of
himlelf thaa of his neighbour ; of ascribing to
himfelf virtues and qualities the pofiefiion of which
he is unwilling to allow to others j and ofdetraft
ing from them exc elleÃcies in which he is norori
ouov deficient, and to which he can never hope
to aVpire by any fubfeqaent exertions. This in
clination predominates in the mind in proportion
a3 thecaufes of it are more or less powerful, more
or less numerous. It reaches not only to indivi
duals ana private society, but extends its influence
to dates and nations. Thus we frequently fee
a foreigner so ltrongly prejudiced i n favour of his
country, from which perhaps he was transported
for crmes that are a disgrace to humanity, redden
with anger at a supposed afperfton against his coun
trymen, 6y whom he had been treated with the
greatest contempt, which he very justly merited.
That the Americans are exempt" from national
prejudice is far from being the truth. The inha
bitants of al mo ft cvei y '.late in America are diftin
guithe l by some particularities, either ot speech
or behavior, peculiar to thcmielves. The mofl
apparent national diftin&ions appear to exist be
tween the natives of the New England states and
the inhabitants of all the others, from their fre
quently stigmatizing each other with the satirical
appellations of Cracker, Yankee, Lovers of Pork
and Molalfes.* bad Pror.ouncers of their own
tongue, and many other l'uch like elegant epi
thets. si Particular instances ought not tojuf
t'-fy general conclusions." Therefore that beha
viour which chara&erizes a few in any (late ought
not to be indiscriminately attributed to all, noi
stamp their national character. To judge of a
whole people by a few individuals argues want ol
experience, an unacquaintance with men and
manners, and a mind clouded with prejudice and
absorbed in ignorance. "There are good as well as
bad in all societies." If a pariallel were drawn
between the northern and southern states, by bal
ancing the advantages and disadvantages on both
fides with regard to the use or cant words and
phrases, the scale might preponderate in favour
of the former, for there the greatest attention it
paid to learning, which is conspicuous from the
number and diversity of excellent literary instituti
ons established in every part.
The conversation of many of mv fellow citizens
at certain seasons especially, turns entirely on
the meetings and exploits (past, present, or tc
come) of the sons of St. Patrick, St. Andrew, or
St. George. I could wifli to observe to those
who have been born in countries under the sup
posed patronage of atfy of the a foresaid right
worfliipful personages, but have left them to
take their final residence in America, that it
would better become them to acknowledge their
new father St. Tammany, who is a father to
them bv the fame rule that "a friend in need
is a friend indeed," and who is so far from the
ftrittnefs of their foimer patrons that he has ne
ver attempted to enforce any other rule than
that Â«Â» every man /hall do as he pleafes/' But,
if there is any excuse for the natives of Europe,
what are we to think of those who* as well as
their fathers and grandfathers before them, were
born in this country, and yet have searched their
pedigrees to find out which of the European
* Which is derived from the cvjlcm, common in
Neiu Englands oj curing fork with molajfcs, not
from eating them together
faints they belong to ! there is Christopher Bog
herry, a pretty equal mixture of German and
rifh, but perceiving that the Germans seldom
rolic for their faint, and reconciling his Irifli
lame, he, in the dialedt of his mother's family
wears that he will join the sons of St. Patrick,
for he has been drunk with t jem more as two
:imes areaty. And my neighbour Jonathan
Gregor, descended on b>th fides from the fir it
fcttlera of New England, is determined to join
HIC Sons of St. Andrew j for, "odds fvamp it,
as sure as snakes, it mu(fc be tarnation ciever
fun though the mixture in honest Jonathan's
blood is such as would puzzle a good Jockey,
a th all his knowledge of quarters, eighths, fix
tcenths, and thirty seconds, \o ascertain what
proportion of it is Scottilh. But enoughâi he

of our origin, to stop in Europe but proceed to
