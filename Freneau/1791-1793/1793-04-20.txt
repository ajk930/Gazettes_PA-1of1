THE !atj king of France is no more !â
When the Marquis la Fayette, and the
w men, who -with him. h :d caught the fire ol
liberty in America, and had kindled the sa

inthecooqnetts of reason & common fenft

engaged against the rights of mankind.

SATURDAY, April 20, 1793.
When the nation had divided itfelf into
two deliberative depirtmrntsâthe one at
thc Jacobin Convent, and the other at the
Dome of the Fuelliersâthe former for the
support of a republic, and the latter for the
refloration of mon rchy, we were alarm
er' ;it the zeal of the Jacobins ; and though
ue liad so lately palled through the bloody
and diftrefiing of a revolution, yet
we fondly hoped to have a crown cast tc
(lie earthâa throne underminedâa nobil
ity deflroyed-âftri execrable priefthootl ex
tirpated, wifhout a ltrUggle, or a sanguin
ary process.
The patriots of France were at last con
vinced that the king was fiipporting with
the money of the nation, the armies of the
x-princesj fie was making an attempt to
join them : It was evident that he consi
dered the oaths which he fyad taken, as by
no means obligatory. They (awth.it he
iigned all aÂ£b, but those which tended to
the support of the partial revolution which
had been effected. No alternative was left
but those of the abolition of monarchy, pr
the deltruefion of freedom ; the former
neceflarily involved the definition of the
sing, and the latter, as neceflarily that of
theÃational Assembly, with the liberty o!
rhe pewple. Thu- situated, the conftitu
ion, which the king was secretly under
lining, was openly overthrown by the peo
jle, and a conuituiidnpropofed, which w a:
rounded in the true principles of philofu
}hy. That prodticlion dot v honour to hi!
nan nature ; it is the mo'.l perfect mode
â if civil government that can ever appeal
imong men. The king at that time was
nade a prisoner. We fKH rejoiced in thf
Drogref- of freedom. Oar pulpits were
is rapt in adoration, because kings were lain
'Â« chains, and princes in fetters of iron.
Our papers were full of exultation at the
\irth cfafifter Republic- We openly gave
t as our opinion, that there would not be
i king in Europe at the end of ten year .
Yet we knew th it all the monarchs in j i.
ope, all the nobility of the world, and all
:hc clergy"of (hii'Jcniom, were tngagicl
igainft the French. It was the cause of
â oya'ty and hereditary dignity, that urged
hem on. What is the language of some
jf the men now, w ho w ere so very zealous,
hen -? They saw without tears or emotion,
:he (laughter in Paris, which hurried 150 c
:itizens, in an instant, from this to another
world. But when the news of the death
as the man who was unfortunately the
cause of this, is brought to us, we give up
all for 1011, and even blush at the name of
iberty. What is It that renders his blood
so very precious," but the love of royalty ?
But it is (aid that he h . d done nothing wor
thy of deathâand that his tiial was not
fair. â How do we know this ? The trial
could never have been Jis it (land . ih our
newspapers.âShall we condemn fever
hundred men, nay, a whole nation, with
i: their being heard ? A million of peo
ple, at leal, were witnefies of the unfor*
tun ate exit of Louis the Sixteent'h.
Are we to believe that a majority of those
u ere in favour of his dea:h. when thai
death was unnecefiary ? Let the m m whe
-Ondemns the measure as cruel, fanguina
â¢y, or unneceflary come forth an<l fliew
.hat Louis the SixteiH.t/l.was determined ta
th into private life, to become a common
itizen,' and to abandon the throne for him
" If and posterity ; and that monarchs of
iirop'e had given over the idea of reftor
ng France to monarchy, and he will fup
ioi t his objection. He ought to do this,
jr to censure the measure only, because he
loVcs monarchy, delights in royalty, and
[tefpifes republicanism.

T OBSERVED fo:ue tlmefince, in ail ex
*â¢ trait from the proceedings of the Houft
>f Commons in England, a l'peech of Mr.
Surke's, in'which he drew a comparifoi
jctween the revolutions of France anc
America, and aflerted, thatâ" There ne
rer was one deliberate murder committer
Itiring the American war." And L alfc
jbferved in one of yjnr papers an extraÂ£l
rom an F.nglifh paper, in following
,1 ordsâ" A Choitaw or a Cherokee, only
wreck their vengeance npon tliofe wlic

*nd children are refpefled by them ant
:he hatchet is never iaken up but r.gainfl
:he maleparfof their fpesâbut in France
neither age nor sex lias been refpefted.'
It isonly neceflafy to read the above tc
know, that these are the aflertions of the
tools of party, who pay as little refpeft tc
truth, as they do tothe rights and happincf
ot their fellow creatures, and whofepow
eris e,.abli,,.ed by usurpation and injustice
and t ail only be fuported by falfehood anc
oppceflioii. The aflertion of Mr. Burke'
can be proved to hefcJfe by tljoiifaiifls o:
l.vjng witnefles ; and the other i< knowi
to be a notorious lie by every child of o:ih
tea years old in America. It appears, tha
Burke and allot kites are endeavoring t<
make people beiieve that tyrants, arifto
cr tsandfav ges, are less cruel than thi
defenders of. liberty : But let us judge
from facts. During the American w:;
there were many criieltiesexercked by.thi
American:, (tho' perhaps fewer than ii
wars in general but they were done bj
individuals, andnsvcr countenanced bytln
majority of the party, nor by tliofe in pow
er ; on the contrary, they always treated
their, prisoners with the greatest humanity
But the royal party did not imitate them,
but encouraged every species of cruelty
and praiVifed it 011 their prisoners : The)
sent them to gacl, and fuft'ered them to be
hung by Cunningham the goaler, withoui
trial ! âl'hey flow ed thousands of them or
board afhip, where they died by hundred:
of a week 1 becanfe thty would net fighi
againit their country ; and their bone,
now lay bleaching on Long-Island fiiore.
(not one mile lrom this;) where these
who doubt may be convinced. /
As to the cruelties of the patriotsi-oj
France, (so much talked of) the accounts,
ill the firft place, come to us much exag
gerated by Britilh aristocrats, and they
were generally committed while the nation

vvouid be too late to wrest the power from x
!nrnâthey resolved upon the only expe

there were any innocent persons perifhcd

'ingle one named) their bleed n.uft be 1; id
to those who caused the necessity of tie '
measure, and to those followers oTcvtry
party who take advantage of public disor
der to gratify private resentment. and not
to the patriots. The last dQ of cruelty
imputed to them, is the death of Louis.
But, the patriots of France can no more be
called cruel for putting Louis to death,
than our laws can for hanging the chief of
a gang who had rdbbed a honfe, and when
they were opposed, murdered part of the
family: For,though he murdered no perfi n
1 im elf, yet others did it for him, and he
vidently encouraged and countenanced
them : And the lives of all those patriots
who fell on the tenth of At:;_ufl. a:,d in
oppolingthe combined armies, are ju<My
charged to this enemy cf mar, Kir.d ; who
yet was so void of remorse as to decline

" God has made man upright, but he has
fought out a variety or inventions." We
may observe in several Qaccies of the brute
creation native propensity winch some
philcfophers fuppuife inherent in man. A
young bull,or a goat,for instance, will per
lorm their mode of military exercise with
the head, before there is the leuftappear

and a whelp-lion will go through all the
formality of roaring, tearing, anc rending
I efore the claw has firmhefi or lharpnefs
enough to inflifl the l't all puffible injury.
But in the young of the human species, we
observe 111 their general temper luMocenie
of heart, finiles, gratitude, benet olenpe,
and affecti'on,which continue till such times
as they become corrupted by faile princi

The very virtues of monarchy haye all
a cruel and fariguinary tendency, and ex
cit<? the human mind to perpetrations oi
mifchief and horror. An extravagant o
ver-partial love of country is hi ft inculca

a lavage revenge of injuries, artfully pro
voked by court-magicians, against one 01

warded by the crowned sovereign. Mon
archy originated in murder, violence and
robbery ; what wonder then, if in all ages
its violent adherents have been and i till are
111 eftect, murderers and robbers, and that
kingly government, from the nature of its
prerogative's, I'ooner or later, winds up in
afcene of horror and tumult. Monarchy,
or the monarchical principle ioifled into
republics, is the fuel that supports the flame
as discord in this world, tnat set; man a

It is said the State of Delaware is to be
invited to an union with Pennfylvama ant
Mar/iand, for the purpose ot removing the
obftrttfiioiis in the Sufquehan.ia, and ren
d-ring that river navigable through its le

river Delaware, by means ofa canal, whicl
it i, faid,neÂ«,ds scarcely exceed eight mile:
in length to accomplilh so important a.,
object.
In our paper of January 26, under the
Philadelphia bead, mention was made of
the brig A. B. C. Capt. Bartlett, (bound
from Cape Fear to the Chefapeke) having
ftriuk Oil Cape Lookout Shoals, 011 the e
vening of the Bth of December lalf, and in
that lit Ition being abandoned by her ere w,
who with difficulty, saved themselves in the
boat, and arrived fate on the main beach,
to or 11 miles iiorthweftward ot theipot
where the misfortune happened.âlt since
appears, tnat the brig, alter being deserted
by' her crew, drifted from thÂ« flioal 111U1
deep water, upon the riling of the tide,
without having received any damage i and
was soon after met with 40 leagues eatt
ward of the continent, by an EiifiMb vetiel,
who put a mailer and 5 or 6 feainen 011
board. She has since arrived fate at the
i[land ofGueriifevin the Englilh channel.m
good condition, with 275 lilids. ot tobacco
on board, a quantity of hides, indigo, &c.
âI* rom all which it that the
crew, by whom (lie was abandoned, fut
fercd themselves to be frightened befoic
they were hurt.
From the result of several curious expe

from the mean result ol several obferva

space of a minute; whereas, on the ground
f>Â»nly 88 were bbfervable in the fame time.
âWith a Ipadttone, which on the earth
raffed five pounds and an half weight, a

-fufficicnt to raise 4 ounces. âThe highefl
elevation in this aerial voyage was 968 fa

An Alexandria paper gives a particular
detail of the improvements made and ma

computed that f rom l'ii:(?en to twenty lhoÂ»i

Extract of a letter from London, dated
February 6,
" I have herewith sent you a package
of papers ; you will fee in them nothing
but mifreprcfentations of French affairs,
as all the pfepers in London are at open
\ ar witn the French, except two, viz. the
1 M6rning Chronicle,' anil the â¢ Argus'.
You will fee in those which I have sent
you, the debate upon war with France ; it
has been carried without .1 division, and in
three days, from this date, "War againlt
France' will be declared in London. This
nicht, imprefling took place all over Eng
land, a certain forerunner of a bloody
war : We are much attached to a monar
chical government and the very idea of a
republican; sickens parliament, as well as
the low and illiterate, the latter of wljom
are very numerous here. All the enlight
ened, independent, and dilinterefted part
of the kingdom, are againlt going to war
with France, and I think very justly too ;
why Ihould England, that is called a ' free
country' with to maintain its own liberty,
and, at the fame time, endeavor to destroy
that of another country ? This T will as
sert, that there is not the smallest iota, or
the leaff veltige, of that boasted freedom
to be found in England, which is so indus
triously, and so poir.poufly, difTcminatcd
throughout the world. Some objects at a
distance, appear more desirable. than when
closely obfei ved. My de; r fir, our gov
ernment are in the greatest dread and ter
ror, left the French ll'ould be as good as
their word, that is, of landing ijo.ooo men
on our coafl, which they positively sent us
word they would do, if we should make
war, and join the combination of tyrants
ar;ainft them. I can allure you, were filch
a lircumftance to take place, they would,
in the courfeof three days, find their num
ber.! increased to 600,000, as the republi
can party in this country are very numer
ous and determined, and I hope will in a
short time follow the glorious example of
their Gallic neighbors. I think by the time
you receive this, that Dumourier will be
in poffeliion of Amlterdam, & very likely
of the seven United Provinces. Heis now
very near being at O.tend, only waiting to
hear the refill t of the British court respec
ting warâhe is a brave General, a worthy
man, and the verj' quintef ence of a repub
lican. I am sorry for De la Fayette âhe is
(till a clofeprifoner.âNow is the time for
America to (hew her gratitude to her
friendly ally France. Now is the.lime to
afiift iVi the (truggles for liberty. I expect
before I die. to-fee #he time, when kings
will be very ftarce in Europe."
It i: remarkable (fays a correspondent)
that the militarv successes, or misfortunes
of the Fren claret he thcrmcmeter of Ha
ttoial re ; \r". ;1 i r i this country. ' Dum fe
bene res geruut' (fays the proverb) ' inul
tos nunit'i Ã¼bis amicus'. While a man is
prosperous, all the world are liis friends :
when ctherwife, all the world join in
trainpling him under foot. On the 14th
of July Lit, the anr.iveifary of the immOr
ml French revolution, fcatcely a hundred
persons could be found to meet together
to celebrate (and that in a very humble
manner t>oo) this interesting event. But
110 sooner did the news arrive of Dumour
ier's fticceffes in Flanders than toasts were
every where drank, and tons of wine puz
zled down to " the brave defenders of the
rights of men."âNow again, when the
nation hasfour,d it ' nectlfary' to cut oh
their king's head, nothing but execrati
ons againit the French are heard from the
united shrieks of a monarchical junto ir
this country ; and the political thermo
meter is fallen low, alrnoft to the freez
mg point. JBut, should ' the despotic com

By accounts f rom Holland, the natural
deftnee of that country is to be applied to
in cafe of invasion. Great trails of the
lands of the states general were already
laid under water, and precautions taken
for the fame purpose, 011 the rivers and
different states of Zeland. On or about
the middle of February, the Dutch patri
ots and their adherents who have been in
a ltate of banishment ever since the year
1787, assembled at Antwerp, where they
formed into a legion called the Dutch le
gion, meant to attend C.en. Dumourier in
his attack upon Holland.
Upwards of three tiioufand pieces of
larL;e cannon have been shipped from Eng
land into Ireland during the late winter,
with the greatefl train of field artillery
eyerfent to that country since the expedi

troops, it was thought would be fufficient
to secure the dependence of Ireland upon
Great-Britain.

time felling at 325. the barrel. In Spain
and Portugal the price of these articles was
alio kept up.
The fame letters mention great commo
tions in the north of Ireland. As their last
peaceable measure, the people were ap
pointing delegates to draw up and present
a petition to the king, to be relieved f rom
fuudry grievances and opprefiions.
It is slated in a letter from Port au
Prince (March 13) that owing to diflenti
011s in the army, and the continual deser
tions that were taking place, the negroes
were again getting pofleflion of the plains
in thot neighbourhood, and it was thought
would put the finishing stroke to the pro
perty left in that quarter. A demand had
b en made 011 all maflers of vefiels in the
harbour tofurnifh one third of their crews
to go out against. tlie insurgents ) which
was not complied with, and in revenge no
Vessel was si life red to leave the harbour-
It is stated in a letter from Cette, in the
south of France, that an embargo was laid
on the flipping of all nations in that port,
on the jtfi of February . Tli.?rc were tl.etr /

" We learn from good authority (fays a.
letter from Madrid, dated Jan. 27) that a
treaty ps neutrafity was this day iigiied
between France and Spain.âThe court
went into.mourning'for the death of Lonis,
to continue three months."âlt was the
general opinion at Cadiz about t:.e li; It c.i
March, that if Spain took an â¢ >e p irt iiÂ»

as the Spaniards w ere confident their forte
was not fufiicient -to oppose the progress of

oy iand. The body of the Spanish nation
was so inimical to England, as to induce a
relief, that if the king of 1 pain declarec!
ivar, it would cost him his herd.' Twelve
ail of the line were in cominifr.on at Ca

The Committee reported,
TLa' the advanced (tage.of the session
lias precluded the poffi iiity of their pro
curing- authe ticated cojjy of 'hecaft

or of any documents of an official nature
to eluci ate or explain the conditions o!
important determination; the truth
of which they can find no leafon to con
trovert, though they are, as yet, unappri
zed or the true Hate of tiie circumitance;
attending it.
Thev therefore recommend, that his
excellency the governor be requested tc
procure an a.tested copy of the cafc anr
judgment aforefaid, with the opini ns 01

funport of the fame, for use of the le
p (i iture, ,-.t their next session, in orde 1
th. t authen ic and leafonable i. formatiot
may be had upon this interesting fnbjeft
and proper attention paid to the fame.
The report was agreed to. In the house
of reprcfentacives it was lfo,
Ordered, That th e (eeretary be direftet

I \v?.i p : eafed that the motion of Doc
tor Jarvis, for calling into view the late
extraordinary determination at the fupremc
ju !' ial con 1 1 of the United S.tates, against
a Oilier 1 ite, was not wholly unproductive,
'} he novelty of a overeign and indepen
dent ('ate being obliged to respond in a
curt of j (lice, confjfling, perhaps, of its
own citizens, is not lei's ft.iking than the
importance of the conftquences which may
! fnjt f oti an acquie cence in this stride
of authority, is interesting to every indi
vidual. For if execution is to be levie
on private property no man is ftfe ; ai, 1
if it be only extended to the pnfleffions ol
the commonwealth, it mufl produce greai
inconvenience, to fay no more.
When the persons in oppoCtion to the
acceptance of the new constitution hinged
oil the article tefpefting t e power of the
judiciary department being so vety exten
five and alarming as to comprehend ever
the state itfelf, as a party on an action ol

Federalists, as an absurdity in terms. But
it is now laid, that 'he eloquent and pro

v.i'.h the [Sropofitiop of the house, to have

u i.leniure the acquisition of the papers in

[From an Engli'lh Paper.3

refi fr.nt in in Rome, ta his corrcfpondenl
m dated the t dtb vf ,
1793-
" Left you should Vie deceived by
publierurrouff, I thought proper to take
tip lie pe: , and give you an impartial and
genuine account of a popular tumult,
which taken pla e litre o*n the 13th
in ft. and which will ever be memorable in
the annals ol Rome. A Frenchman, by
name Bajffvilk, has resided here these two
months patt a.s a kind of ageut for the
French Convention, though he had no
credentials. lie was a man of good ad
dress, an eloquent speaker, and a greater
intriguer ; i t nad been Secretary to Mac
kmi, the French Ambaflador at Nap'es
for the ileiv republic of that infatuated
nation, and worked his way under one pr -
text or other, until he became very trou
btefortte a id obnoxious to the civ;! govern
ment here. He had been sent hither
with a letter of hanks from the Conven
tion to the pope tor having released the*
two French artids, who were irrtprifoned
here fqr having made two lajfu ri-licvvs
emblem itir figures, exprellive of the
French maxims of liberty and equality,
and trampling upon the tacred lymbols
of religion and its profetTors.
" 1 he I'rench fleet, conlifting of 45
fail, inciudi g 25 ol the line* bomb vefFJs
and rranfports, being ciifperfed by a dorm,
off Sardinia, on the 22el of December,
and t e admiral and vice admiral having
got back to Naples, difmalted and da
maged m ch, the; vice admiral la F1 )tte
came la Friday to Rome by polt, and
next morning waited on the Secretary of
Ot: te with dilpatches from the French re
pu lie, infilling on the pope's acknowledg
ing it omn'i forma the new republic, and a
ret ration of hi late manifedo concerning
the royal arms of '. ranee having been
lake 11 down by fle: Ith in the night time
wirhout his permission, and (he attempt to
put up the new arms of the republic,
which the military received orders to hin
der. This maniiedoof the pope was sent
not only to a 1 the foreign miniltcrs but
also to England throu h the Portuguese
miniderat London. La Flotte and Baf
ieviile threatened an in cafe the
pope came not into their mea'ures ; and
upon a refufal, they behaved like fierce
republicans, in a mod haughty and im
perious manner. On Sunday morning
they renewed their demands, and reminded
the pope of the fatal confluences if he
perlided in his former resolution Hii
reply was, that he had already s;iven his
answer. In the interim La Flotte and
Biifleville had rifolved upon putting up
the arms of the republic, and for this pur
pose wrote a card to the DiredW, by
name Digne, who refuted to comply with
out official orders, which were not com
municated to him. About three o'cl ck in
theaftmioon, La Flotte and Bafleville, the
latter with his wife & children, went out
â¢o take an airing in an hired coach, & dri
ving outside the great gate of Rome, cal
led delpopulo, they ordered the coachman
10 put up a French theee coloured coc
kade, wlijch some of the populace obser
ving on their return, ont;of tlum dopped
he ca riage, and compelled theeoachman,
ftcr some druggie to throw away the
cockade. Badeville offered them his purse
which they rejected with scorn, crying
out Viva laJida Catho/ica, See Bfleville
put out his hat. crying Viva la Liberta,
end ordered the coachman to gallop home.
He was followed to his house, and in an
inflaut the populace increaf d, and Rome
was in an uproar and ferment, nor were
:he military able io quiet the r mirn's,
especially wh-n the two ralh republicans,
on getting out of, the carriage, me aced
therp that Rome would pay for this intuit
the mob grew furious, broke- open the
dqors, and got into the apartments. Baf
fcville fire on them, and wounded three
01 four. Theii fury then knew no bounds;
a barber, with his razor, cut his belly
across'; he was brnifed, feared and woun
ded iu a defptrate manner. Five hundred
ot the military arriving between three and
fur in the evening, rescued him with
difficulty trom the hands of the mob, and
hrought him to the next guard house,
whe e every affidaice that funrery and
phyfi â  could prescribe, were generouflv
' dminidered to him by order of the govern
ment. That night B tfleville called for a
clergyman to adminiltertohim the rites of
the church. The pope's vicar general, & se
veral eminent ecclesiastics attendedhiirt, &
lie departed this life in a very defervinguian
ner on Monday evening about seven o'
clock. The rcfillance m de, and the shots
fired by Baffeviile, afforded an opportunity
to the artful & cunning La Flotte tomake
his escape from the roof into an adjoin
ingpalnce belonging to the Marquis Pa
lombara, who let him down by a cord into
a hen yard, and there fee eted him for some
â  ime till a futher reinforcement of 3000
military coming to his atfiltance, he was
sent oft'by pod, at the pone's expence,
with Bade .-.lie's wife and children to Na
ples, to join, his 90 gun (hp there, and tef
tify to the world, thic Rome lhewid him
mercy & generality, when he was infultin^
and endeavouring by various means to
prejudice her to the utmolt of his power,
she mob was very riotous mo.t of Sunday
night, and let fire to the French Ac de
my. where they found and'b oke to pieces
i new itatue alluljye to the French max
ims of liberty and equality.âThis noble
building r.-as f ived by the exertions of the
n lit.'ry, who ioou extingui!"he4 the flarr.es.
The fgnator of Rome, with #some others
of the nobility, courageously threw tl.em
[elves into the crowds, and harangued them
th great zeal. When the popi; was ap
prised of tile tumult, he dispatched fevera!
mefFengers to the 'populace, bif.ething
he,ti to defill from their tumultuous pro
leedinjs, an ! return pea.eably to tlieii
refpedtive abodes. He rep iired to St Pl'
ter's church, where he lay p oilrate in
jrayer, and bathed in tears, before the
Ittines of St. Peter and Paul âThis had s
tioft poweifu effect on the mob, and foor
ifi'naged their fury ; for they flocked t<
St. Peters, to the a no'int of near 50,000
-ending 'he air, and echoing the heavens
with repeated (hnuts, for near an hour, o
r<ivi In Jida Catholica !
" It is conjectured here that Baflevilk
find La Flotte's behaviour, on tiie abovt
nee lion, was a manoeuvie to try the pulfc
)f the Roman people, and to discover
whether they were disposed Sor a revolu
ton and for adopting the modern Fr nch
nnxims of >iber y and equality, &c.
Prince A uplift us, the sixth f n'of our be
