lottery BILL.
[The Lottery Mania king very prevalent]
' in llu United Statu, perhjps it may
not brove unacceptable to our readers to
pnJent 'th":H with afe.o jl'urt fetches from
the brincipalJpetches agamjt Lotteries, in
a late debate in th" Briiifh House 6j Com
mons on that fubjecl. Aiiirntidverjijiis of
this nut are nuiy jet our liyjlaters a think*
171 ,r on trie various and fcriovs evils at
tending that ixecra'jl: mode of taxation.J
npHE Older of the day, for the house
X to resolve itl'elf into a committee
on the lottery bill, having been read,
and the motion made, " tfiat the ipeak
er leave the chair,"'
Mr. M. A. Taylor f.Â»id,that " feeling
as he did on the fubjecl of the lottery,
it was impofiible to with-hold hisoppo
fition to the Speaker's leaving the chair.
If the pernicious eft'e&s of lotteries
were at all doubtful, Mr. .Taylor said,
he could produce luch examples of mif
chief cauicd by them, as would convince
the mo ft obstinate, or the moll preju
diced man living. His intention, he de
clared, was to propose a motion, tor a
committee to enquire into the evils re
iulting from lotteries. li any gentle
man at all looked at the.fubjeÂ£l, he was
persuaded he would find'that much mif
chief 'perpetually occurred in conle
quence every year, and if he wanted au
thorities, he flrould refer to the honora- j
b!e gentleman over the way (Mr. Rose) ;
who seemed to be aware of the griev
ance, bv the various bills ot regulation,
with ref'petl to lotteries, that he had
from time to time introduced, it that
gentleman would only look to the evil,
he would find that notwithstanding the
regulations he had endeavored to apply
to it, the evil l'Ull existed in full force.
Mr. Taylor read a paragraph from a
newspaper, Rating, that the grand jury
for Middlesex had at the lall fellions
presented lotteries as a grievance, in
confluence of t?ie illegal insurances
that always accompanied their being
drawn,-That article, he said, he should
think would have weight with the
house. The grand jury, it was obvious,
could not call lotteries nuisances. be
cause they were licensed by the legiila
ture ; but they applied to a court of
justice to fignify their lenie of their ef
fect*. In the niidft of a long and cala
mitous war," the argument of the ad
vantage that relulted to the public Irom
a lottery, might be urged with much
force, but he appealed to the right hon.
gentleman, whether we are at present
under any l'uch circumstances ? The
right hon. gentleman had lately propo
sed to give up some taxes, as well as to
apply an additional lum towards the
reduction of tire national debt. He de
clared, he wifhedvvith all his heart that
the right hon.gentleman had reierved
the taxes, and abandoned the lottery.â
He was fare the public would have de
rived more lafttng advantages, and have
had reason to give thanks ior luch a
preference. He was aware that lotte
ries raifefi money with a degree of la
bility iuperior to that of molt other
sources of revenue, and he admitted,
that it was a circumftsr.re of conhdera
ble importance ; but as it could be of
none under the present circumstances
of the country, and weighed again ft
the good morals of the people, it was
light and trivial. Another objection
to the lottery then proposed was, that
the evil was no longer to beocca'ional;
it was not to stop this year ! The right
hon. gentleman had himlelf propoied
to continue lotteries year after year. In
the ftrcets in that part of the town,
Mr. Taylor said, he understood there
were E.O. and hazard tables adapted
to all ranks of people, which he attri
buted to the spirit of gambling arising
flora lotteries, and to that only. Such
mischievous praÂ£Hces m'ght be remedi
ed by laws, but it would be impossible

aslotteries continued to receive the Unc
tion or Parliament, and therefore lie
should objedl to the speaker's leaving
the chair."
Mr. Francis said, "he came there to
support his hon. Friend's motion for a
committee of enquiry. The lottery was
undoubtedly a very great evil ; it ex
tended up to the highest, and down to
the lovvelt clals of the people : to that
ufeful clals, whole industry was affect
ed by it, and their morals poilonedand
perverted. It was laid, Mr. Francis
obierved, that gambling was the vice of
the age, but lotteries, he was penuaded,
afforded a greater leduttion than any
other Species of gambling, becaule they
held out, for a trifling risque, great pro
bable advantages, such as the obtainment
of a thousand pounds for so small a ium
as a guinea, and loon in proportion.
If the lottery was only the relource
of the present year, he declared he would
not onpofe it, but it was to be a perpe
tual means of raising money, and as a
permanent plan lie inurt object to it. It
was laid, that it was voluntary,and that
men need not engage in it, uniefs they
chose it. Mr. Francis denied the fatt,
and contended that there was no viola
tion in the cafe. They put temptation
in the way of the middling and lower
class of the people, and as it were,
thereby invited them to do, what they
| otherwise would have no idea of. Gam
Â« bung, Mr. Francis laid, was the vice of
the higher ranks, and not of the lower
clals, but lotteries brought the vice
home to their doors, and tempted them
to do that, wheh naturally they had no
inclination for. They heard repeated
ly of men being convicted of ielonies
every fcflions at the Old Bailey, and
sentenced to transportation, or death.
Let them enquire into the caulcs ol the
crimes that drew down luch a f ate up
on the unhappy wretches, and they
would find thole of the majority origi
nated in lotteries. Gambling was a
vice, they ail knew, which men of the
molt enlightened minds, men poffelfed
of reason and capablc of reflection could
not refill; and how could they expect
the ignorant and uninformed, to have
the virtue to withfland it, when its
Captivating allurements were held out
to them r" What, he would ask, cauled
the revolution abroad P All manner ol
profligacy, but chiefly gaming, which
was eilablilhed by government, ami
countenanced by the court. Why was
it so countenanced ? For obvious rea
sons : to engage* mens minds, and ab
itraft them from too deeply regarding
the conduit of an arbitrary government.
11l such a government it was policy, but
was the cafe the fame here ? exafctly the
reverse. The court by its pra&ice
(hewed no favour to gaming, but at the
fame time, the legislature encouraged it.'
'â  Mr, W. Smith supported the argu
ment against lotteries, and particularly
urged the milchiefs arising from illegal
insurances. He said a man who took
insurances had opened a shop near his
own house, that he was removed by the
magi Urates, but that he returned, and
contributed to fleece every lervant in
the neighborhood. Mr, Smith Hated
other grounds of objection."
li Mr. Sheridan declared, atradefrnan
in Westminster had allured him that he
had loft more than 401. a vear in bad
debts owing to the lotteiy, which were
incurred by poor persons, whom his
humanity would not let him proceed
againll by law. That gentleman told
him, that odious as the shop tax had
d. . -rvedlv been, he had rather pay 301. a
year [hop tax, than that there fhoukl be
an annual lottery. A fewyears fir.ee, Mr.
Sheridan laid, he had taken pains, to
gether with a person employed by go
vernment, to put a flop to illicit prac
tices in the lottery ; and a pawnbroker,
a man of character and feeling, had
hid observed perfonsproceed, in bring
ing their effects to his (hops, in coriic
quence the lottery. That they were
nut the drunken and idle, but t>f a very
different description, the industrious
and sober, in short, honest hard-work
ing people. They began fir ft with bring
ing their fuperfluities and little orna
ments, then their goods, then their
working tools, then their effeÂ£U, appa
rel- &c. down to the clalps in their
children's shoes. In fliort, the pawn
broker had declared, he was at lait
ashamed of his profefliori, from the
wretchcdnefsit enabledhim to witness."
Mr. Wyndhamj ''argued against lot
teries, and laid, the worthy magistrate
â  had staled that the abuses prattifed this
: year were greater than ever. For his
i pari, Mr. Wyndham laid, he thought
them so great, that no advantage of re
; venue could compenla'e for them.â
â  With regard to lotteries, if the evil that
attended them could be separated trom
â¢ the good to the state that they produced,
io much the better, if not, the belt
â  way would be to abolish them. Mr.
Wyndham laid, that the money they
produced, could not be called clear
gain, becaule in consequence of lotte
ries, many individuals could not pay
their taxes, and for this he did not
want facts to prove it ; it was in the
nature of the thing itfelf. Mr. Wynd
ham added other local arguments against
lotteries in general.''
Mr. Pulteney said, "he had ever con
sidered lotteries as measures to be resort
ed to only in war and in exigencies of
state. The right hon. gentleman, he
observed, had said, that the lottery re
lieved the people from taxes ; but he
would alk, was not the lottery a tax in
which their payment was voluntary ?
It was the nature of all the taxes to be
lo ; if people did not chufc to pay the
taxes they did not confumo the article
taxed. A lottery was the worst fort of
tax, as it injured the morals of the peo
ple."
THE RECRUITING OF THE PRUS
SIAN ARMY,
(Extractedfrom a letter of Baron CLootz,
Jur;nerlji an officer in published
in the Chronique de Paris.)
Good looks, and a lofty ftaturc are
considered in Prulfia as a Icourge from
heaven by the dilconfolate mothers who
follow their forlorn children at a dif
tar.ee. 1 have seen a drove of recruits
"and a drove of oxen enter Berlin by the
lame gute ; nor would I have helitated
10 prefer the fate of the latter. Speedy
death is preferable to a tedious slavery,
to a daily baftniado, to the canine hun
ger of a man half starved, and tothefhi
vering inilsry of a man half clad. De
crepitude alone rcftores him the liberty
of palling the frontier to beg his bread ;
for the eltabliflyment of a handful of in
valids in Prulfia is no better than a pi
tiful mockery. The eld ioldiers beg
ging in the ftrcets of Berlin, are as trou
hlalome as the young monks begging in
tlie streets of Rome. By way of get
ting rid of them, they are sometimes dri
ven out of the country : the govern
ment might as well imitate the conduit
of the Lacedemonians towards the He
lots'. The children are expefed in Chi
na ; in Prulfia the old men.
I watonce pitying a femalepeafant who
had brought a detormed child into the
world, tbir. said jhe . your mother is more to
be pitied than lam if or you would not wear
the uniforms if you. had the good fortune to
be deformed. Thetribunals re-echo with
crimes unknown in other countries. A
mother is accused of having tv.'ifted the
leg of her child, and a father of having
favoured the flight of his lon. The re
cruiters traffic with maternal tenderness,
as pricfts do with popular superstition.
A rich farmer gives a hundredcrowns
to save his Benjamin, but the next year
unless a new ransom make him quit
his hold. Milery, dcfolation, ml'ult
and impunity, arc the nurferics of the
Prussian army. The recruiting officers
are worle than vultures and tygcrs.
They plague, plunder, rob, and ravish,
and in concert with the tax gatherers,
lay hold upon men and things in the
name ofaking fond of war or of parade.
The very pedestrian travellers are {nap
ped up without mercy, if of a tolera
ble I was witncl's myfelf to the
taking of two handsome capuchin friars
who were sent to carry the muiket at
Potsdam in the firft battallion of guards.
The famous General Wolferfdorf, no
torious for his horrible manner of re
cruiting, dragged a poor parl'on from
his vicarage, and sent him gagged and
fettered in a cart to Magdeburg, where
he exchanged his black cassock for a
bluejacket. Hunger and third are em
ployed to obtain the of the
wretched men thus kidnapped ; picklcd
herrings are given them, and it is not
till they have ligned the contrast of
their servitude that they are permitted
to drink a glass of water.
The Prullian garrisons are ravaged by
suicide, and the greater number of the
soldiers who die upon the fcaffold have
committed a crime on purpose to die in
a chrijlian like way. Themilitary school
of Berlin being fituatcd on the Spree, I
used to fee from my window the deacl
bodies of soldiers, who had put an end
| to their existence, floating in the river.
One evening we heard a discharge of
muiketry upon the place of arms, and
what was it but twelve or fifteen
veterans, who having made together the
only good meal thevhad tailed in their
lives, ihot themselves within the hear
ing of the king. I will not enter into
the lamentable detail of the internal re
gulation of the barracks, or of the ex
ternal regulations of the parade and e
volutions. Ennui and grief prey upon
those prisoners, who keep the whole
nation prisoners. Defertipn would be
general among them, if a war broke
out with any power but Austria, the
name of which is abhorred by the
Prussians. As manyot the soldiers earn
their livelihood by peaceful occupati
ons they detest war, and set the exam
ple of detection to those whole discon
tent has not discontinued, since the day,
that the fatal number of feet and inches,
that caufcs their misfortune, wastraced
with chalk upon their breads. In short
a Chridian in Algiers, or a negro in the
Weft Indies, has less to undergo than <t
Prussian soldier.
T O N D O N, April 16â28.
Much has been laid of the affidance
to be afforded, and the troops to be em
ployed by the king of Sardinia, in fa
vour of the French emigrants. The
following answer to a recjuiiition of the
French minider on this fubjett will
show that the king of Sardinia means
not to intermeddle in French affairs :â
" 1 HAT the king ot Sardinia receiv
ed with great plealure the assurances
given him by the king, of good neigh
borhood between the two nations.
" He flatters himfelf that he has giv
en fufficient proofsof hisdefire of peace,
to expect a return of the fame from
France,
" Although the king of Sardinia ought
not to think it necellary to disavow ru
mours falfely circulated, lie declares
nevertheless, that his troops are much
below their peace edabllfhment,
'â¢ The king equally declares, that it
is fr.!;e. that he has sent a train of ar
tillery into Savoy ; the ordinary num
ber el infantry :n garrison there hava
not all the cannon which they ought
to have.
Finally, the king of Sardinia pro
tests, that he has never tolerated affem-
of emigrants in his dates, and
as to the enrollments pretended to be
made by theirs nothing can be mora
falfe.

Few people have a proper sense of the
importance of the success ofthe French re
volution to the welfare and happiness of
America. Should a counter-revolution be
ultimately eifedled in France, the advo
cates of hereditary government and titu
lar dignities here may again be embolden
ed to come forward with their pernicious
doOrinesâ Should the French revolution
eventually fucced, a moderate degree of
vigilance on the part of the people of this
country will preserve a pure republican sys
tem, and crush those plans of ambition
which have been long hatching for us on
the hot-bed of European depravity.

â vhich is enriching itfelf at their expence.--
Ler the truth be honestly fpoken-. The ca
pitals in the bank are more than fifty per rent.
in the market above the funis fubferibed.
An annual dividend is expeited of nine or ten
per cent. This is an enormous profit. Whence
is it to proceed ? From the grant of the go
vernment ? At wiiofe expellee ? At the exptnet
of the people. Did the fubferibers earn such
a profit by their services ? Many of them
were enemies or aliens to our country
Where they entitled to it by their lolfes ?
Molt of them had previoully gained

purchase the charter with their money ?
I'hey paid nothing for it. Were they bound
by the conditions of the charter to any fu

government(hould furnifh the opportunity.
If the conOimtnn then had authorized the
mcafure, the people had a rig ht to more than has
Seen got for them. They hid a 1 iÂ°ht to 'he
worth ot the charter. They had a right to some
thing equivalent or nearly so, to 50 per cent on
the private (lock of the tank. They had a right
to a valuable consideration for thefour millions ot

will rile in proportion as they unrlerfland it.
Until the bank then fnall make rtditution ot
its unearned, nnparchaled, and unmerited
monopoly, or shall otherwise indemnify the
public, it may boafl of its utility to itfelf; but
let it (pare the mockery of boafiirig its utility

THE KING OF SWEDEN.
AH the accour.ts from Sweden prove
that the attempted assassination of the king
is not the fruit of any new doflrines, as has
been ignorantly, or malevolently insinuat
ed, but the natural conference of pnffions,
which, in all ages, have stimulated men to
crimes, r.nd burnt as fiercely in the bosom
of the iioble as of the peaunt âambition
and revenge.
He had made hirfifelf obnoxious to hi<r
nobility, by wresting from them the whole
power of the government, and concentrat
ing it in the crown. The}' rrfented his
usurpation ; by the rigour with which he
maintained it against all their plots at home
and intrigues abroad, their hatred became
implacable ; and the fame order of men.,
who are endeavouring to plunge France in
blood for the recovery of their privileges,
conspired in Sweden the murder of their
Sovereign.
No man who regards the principles of
jtiftice or freedom, will be the advocate of
Guftavus. His contest with the noblef#
was not for the people, but for himfelf-
They were courted, and in some degree
favoured, as the only means of temporary
support ; but If we look to the eagerness
with which he courted fublidies from fo
reign powers, and the anxious diligence
with which he laboured to increase his ar
my. we must conclude, that his ultimate
obieot was to involve nobles, citizens, and
peasants in one common defpotifim
As little will any man of generous or
manly feeling vindicate the plotagain't his
life. The foul crime of afiaffination fill*
every untainted mind with horror, bccaufe
it deitroys tile very principle Of mutual
confidence, without which society is not a
(late of security but of fear. But let it not
be charged on any deftrines, that an en
lightened age, or philosophical disquisitions
on the rights of man, have promulgated.
It is the miserable remnant of feudal bar
barism, and superstitious ignorance; of
times in which reason was weak and paf
iion strong, and any means of revenging ail
injury or reclaiming a right, where thought
to be justified by the end.
Never were more pailis taken in every
part of Europe to suppress the events flow
ng from the ebullition of the public mind
than at this moment. The ftriftelt eyeis held
over the press in every despotic {late, and
though France opens to all Europe, by its
centrical lituation, a free channel of com
munication, yet the violation of the post in
every adjacent country keeps from the pub
lic eye all knowledge of the ferment which
rages in the bosom of every kingdom more
or less.
This may have its influence. By pre
venting the circulation of knowledge, it
may make In en tame and paffivc, but this
can only be for a time. The circumstance
of a free press, in a country so centrically
fitliated as France, and in a language fr>
generally read, cannot long exist in vain.
Men who think Will readâand all the arts
of the most watchful government, will not
long prevent the introduction of the jour
nals, sacred to freedom, into every
in Europe.N E JV - r 0 R k.
THE beautiful situation of that city, and the
city itfelf, is now displayed to more advan
tage than ever, to the view of" him that approach
es it from the fouthweftward, by the removal of
the old Fort George*. Instead of that clumsy for
trefs, we now fee an elegant building (unfortu
nately one story too low) deilined for the residence
of their governors, with its appendages of gar
dens, out-houfes, ike.âThe ground hjs been le
velled considerably below the foundation of tiic oid
lort, and a solid frame bulk-head of square h.wn
timber, filled with ftanc, is cairied many fathoms
into the Hudson, affording a fine spacious gra
velly walk on the margin of that noble r.\er, for
the refrefhment of the citizens. This walk,
when planted with trees, will be the mod elegant
in America, and affording a prospeCt scarcely in
ferior to any in Eurepe, and exceeded only, and
that ?n no great degree, by the views in and about
the bay of Naples, in Italy.
The removal of a number of mean fabric?,
wooden fheds,foldiers' barracks, &c. from the vi
cinity ofthis spot, and the substitution of elegant
buildings, will give this extremity of the iiland all
the advantages, in point of appearance, that it so
well deserves,âAn elegant flreet is now extended
along the Hudson to the northern extremity of the
city ; which fireet will no doubt be a highly com
mercial one when piers and basons are formed for
the protection of vefleis in the ruder seasons of tl.e
year.

REMARKS on the ADDITIONAL DUTIES
9 n IMPORTS.
[ Continued from our lojl and concluded. ]
TrIAT the supposition on which this conclu
sion appears to be built is unfounded, is a faÂ£t
which all those acquainted with foreign markets
can attest. Foreigners, instead of charging higher
prices to those of their correspondents in this coun
try, whose lolid Ity was apprehended tobedubipus,
would withdraw their connexion rather than ha
zard a loss of property bj confiding it to fui'h cha
racters. The British merchants have better me
thods of becoming acquainted with the pecuniary
ability and resources of their commercial friends
here, than the Secretary appears to be apprized of.
They fekCt their men ; and instances are numer
ous which demonstrate their circumfpettion. Ma
ny applications for credit have been, and Hill are
reje&ed ; and it seldom happens that a new ap
plicant can succeed unless supported by a guaran
tee of some house of eiUblifhed refpe&ability and
property. Hence it results, that no reason for
concluding that goods are imported on better
terms than formerly, in consequence of the im
proved (late of the credit of the union, can be sup
posed to exist.
But in considering this fubje<3,y*tf<s7j art of mere
efficacy than theoretical deductions. During the
last four or five months, the manufacturer:, and
merchants of EnglanJ have uniformly apprized
their American correfpondednts, that certain fa
brics have advanced in price veiy considerably;
and the specimens already arrived, verify the in
formation. 1 hey are certainly as dear as at any
per ft nee the peace. This however is not af
ciibed to the decline of our credit, but to thof
unÂ»>irt<een, unaccountable circumstances which
occasionally emerge in the course of events. If
the iajciences were founded, we foould
look for the cause of such a revcife, to the d--
prefiion ef our credit j but iincc this ij by nO
means the proper source to which the a Iter at; Ml
js imputable, we may warrantably decide that the
Bnclufion, and the intelligence on which it is
erected, have been obtained from tome misinform
ed, p-:rhaps 4 inteiefted qua rrer, and therefore falla
cious and undeserving of such credit as tojuftify
official reliance.
Jf this is the cafe, and if the " advantages en
loyed under the federal government" are a perpetu
al accumulation of new burdensâlf those burdens
mud inevitably be submitted to j we may regret
in silence our ready acquiescence, and acknowledg
ed agency in giving exiltence to the new conitituii
un j but pray let us be permitted to groan and la
ment, without the mortifying circumltance of be
ing officially told we are more happy in proportion
as our opprcfiions arc encieafed.
Sincc the publication of the fecre'ary's report
on the lubjedt of manufactures, it has not been
difficult to anticipate what measure* would be pro
posed ; and it now appears thaiâas a spirit of
manufacturing prevails at this time in a greater de
gree than it has done at any antecedent period, an
increase or duties as far as it ihall tend to second
and aid this spirit, will serve to promote efTentiaJ.
ly the industry, the wealth, the firength, the inde
pendence, and the fubftanrial prosperity of the
country." Hence, it fecms, in order to gi-.e a
fpec'ious colouring to measures direclly repugnant
to deliberate opinions formerly avowed. opprciftve
rates of duty mult be recurred to, and the fubfla;.-
tiai revenues of commerce faciificed to the vision
fÂ»ry phantom of manufactures. Was the proiix,
laboured report on that subjeCt, originallv intend -
ed tÂ© prepare the public mind for a ready recep
tion of the piopofed augmentation of duty on im
ports? It evidently has this afped j but, howevei
well written that performance may be, it can ne
ver effect impofiibilitiee, nor reconcile us to mea
lures incontrovertibly wrong.
From what comer of the union the fecietar\
has been favored with such undoubted intelligence
respeCting this manufaCturing spirit, as jultifict
him in officially announcing its extreme preva
lence, is a mvilery ro thousands. We know that
experiments have been made in various parts oi
our country to ereCt and support them j with what
luccefs let the prelent lituation of the greater
part declare. Strenuous efforts were exerted to
laile the one attempted in the city of New-York;
but, notwithstanding every endeavour of the repu
table characters who patronized and fuppcrted its
infancy, hao it not been gradually declining, and
now almost extinCt ? The fame lefuit may be
preaiCted with reijeCt to that proposed to be eita
biifhfcd in Jersey. The notoriouily embarrassed
situation of its pecuniary funds as far as they have
been colleCled, and of the man [Col. D.] with
wUom the project oircnfibly originated, aie ftronj,
indications that the period of its ultimate difi'o
lution is not very remote. We cannot therefoie
calculate with laf'ety on any of' thel'e faiiacious ex
periments, nor could the Secretary have rested his
assertion on such grounds j h<s views must have
been direded to the circumscribed efforts of 00-
meftic or private manufa&ures, which however,
except in a few inUances, have advanced little bc
jond the point they had attained fevcralyeais ago.
Now, to bring into view the idea of facrificing an
cftablifhed revenue, or at least of ouprefiinj a
ufeful class of men, in order to cheriih projetis,
which with all the indirect aid of government
will be ultimately regulated by other circumlcan
ces, discovers a wiliingnefs to fcize any plausible
reason for doing that which no reason can julti
fy on the principles of a dilcreet and magnani
mous policy.
Ihe addition of 2 1-2 per cent to the prefenl
50 percent, duty 011 the great mals of no:
imported, is prooofed 3s a temporary expeu ent tt
defray the expences of $he Indian war j and it n
operate only while any part of the charges in
tuned by that war remains unpaid. This tuovi
lion has a dangerous tendency.
Without adverting to all the pofliMe methodi
ivhich future rninilters may invei.t, and comply ins
legillatures Unction,to dilhpaio the public pioL-ei*
ty,it will be no hardy a/fertion if wepiefumc, thai
alwiougir the iiuflilities in which wc are now in
volved, Ihould speedily terminate j yet the antici
pations whfch mult Le recurred to, in uider tc
uilcharge the iocelTaiit calls from that ({uatter, ju-
Iti/y a belief that there will remain a conlideraolc
deb. charitable on the department of war, which,
with .he huit pay of deranged officers, &c. now
and hereafter to be engaged in those hollilitie;,
will terve as a plausible pretext continuing ti,J
high duties j and when thelf objecls are n arl
accompiiflied, other modes of absorbing the public
.reafure, luch as the elfabliihment and iu,,l oi
r navy, ..-ill be brought into view, declared eliVil
:ial to our national existence and rel'peaability.
ind ado; -i. liy these means our burdens w.t; b t
perpetuated, and the hollow promises of office ea
lily evaded.
Were the lefources < f the United States re!>r!d!ct
:o thu species us revenue, we should let down in
jafiive silence, and lament ihe necellity of fubrnit
ing to measures which the exigence of ourpoii
:ical situation rendered indiipcnfible. But 1
his the true state of the matter ? 'i'he fecreur*
las indeed proposed three aitemativea, two o,
yvhich are conceived ineligible and the o.her re
tommended. If no other sources of supply au
[angibie but those exhibited in the report, die
powers of congrifs are much more limited than
people generally imagine. If we turn our
lion to tne present situation of the tracer, indivi
dually, we fnali fee them in a great meafOre reliev
ed of dueCt taxes, by the ailumption of their debts.
If Congrels, instead cf attempting additional du
ties, fhjuld impole a light tax on landed proper
ty, it would constitute a productive revenue, with
jut being opprellive j and Ly rendering it perma
nent, create a finking fund for redeeming the
heavy load of our public debt.
1 am well aware that such an expedient would
by no means accord with the prevailing fcnii
ments of many honest men : but surely, of two
necessary evils it is advifeab e to adopt' thecal';
hazardous: and I presume it will be found, on
due invefligation.that a 1 ght land tax would be iefs
cppreirive and more productive, than a furthei
increase of the duties on imports*
