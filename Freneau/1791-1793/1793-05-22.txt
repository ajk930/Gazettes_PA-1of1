from the {Bojlon) Indepei.dei t Chronicle
WHEN writers appear on the fubjeft 01
neutrality, it is neceflary that the)
fhouM be explicit in what they mean bj
that term. Ifby neutrally it is meant
that we stand, with refpeft to France, ir.
the fame political connection as we do wit!
England ; and that the fame conduit, it
every particular, is to be purlued with tin
latter, as with the former ; such a )tat<
of neutrality is contrary to our prcfeni
u eaty, and contrary to our interest.
It is denied that we are novj in any trea
ty whatever with England ; it is true. :
treaty was entered into, but it is so fla
grantly viol,.ted by the English, by holding
our frontiers, that it is an affront to tilt
U.ilted States, to be told, that it is binding
upon us. Can any man seriously fay thai
tiie conduct ot England and I ranee, as il
relates to this country, is in the leall de
j.-ee Similar ? Has France, Since the Peace,
encroached upon our territory, a d helc
t monopolize the molt \alu -ble pari
as our trade, or aided and afiilled the na
tives to deftroy'the inhabitants Settled o
jur frontiers ? Has France uccafioiied us
'i i expend mi I lions in a war to del end our -
'elves "against the iucurfions of the Indi
ins ?
A writer in the Centinel, who is fond o)
nonthi'. v over matters ~s they relate to the
i!h. Tins ellabliSht d one position, on
.icii lu ground - 'tis argjn ents vhich ,il
Attended to, will operate highly in favour
)f tii. French, to the exclufionot (he Eng-
Hih; 0,-at leatt will prove that the United
States ought to bring Britain to concede to
limila i i ras, we admit tbtm with
in uurports, on the fame footing with the
French.
The writer fays, " that the rrueft policy
af-a nation eonliSts in Me performance or
ts duties." âTo determine our duty, let
us compare the doings ot the two nations.
The Frencn Convention have decreed,
:hat all the ports of the Fre ich clonics
(lionld be open to the veflelsof the United
itates of America. That all merchandize
mportedand exported by American vefl'els,
lhall be fubjeÂ£t to such duties as French
veSFels pay That all laws with regard to
rhefale of timber and American vefl'els be
revoked. Tiiefe are the important deciSi
am of the National Convention in favour
of the United StatesâThis is the encou
ragement given to our commerce by the
FrenchâThis is the friendship displayed
bv that nation.
Let the advocates for Britain produce
(injilar proceedings in the British parlia
ment, and then they will have some color
of pica, that the two nations Hand or,
equal ground with rtfpeft to America.â
On the contrary, our trade is (hackled ir
every part of the English territory ; and
our navigation is embarrafTed by exceflive
duties and prohibitions.
C m any man who feels for the honor
and interest of his country, fay, that when
the two Ambafl'adors ot" England and
France iipwear before the Executive ol
these Stales ; one holding in his hand;
terms of mutual friendfiiip, offering an al
liance founded 011 the most liberal nation
al principles ; the other having not the
most diliant appearance of afriendiv over
ture, but probably bound up with instruc
tions to retain our Frontiers,and to ptirfuc
the famecourfe of commercial embarraff
rnents they have long pracYifed: Can an\
man fay, that the two nations are entitled
to equal favours ! Can they be thought U
(land on the fame ground of national po
lity ?
If we are to follow the portion laid
down by the writer referred to,our condufl
is clear bet ore us. It-is our "duty" ti
oblige the F.ngliOi to comply with theii
treaty, and surrender our frontiers ; and it
is botn our policy, interest and " duty'
that thp embarrafi'ments & reftrittions un
der which our commerce labours by their
aits of parliament. Humid be removed.
Provided an ambefiador from the Bri
tish court should con e forward, it is our
' duty " (as a nation that mean to main
t tin their rights) to be explicit in our de
mands, and before any terms are riegocia
ted, toinliftupona decision by the British
equally as favourable to our commerce,
sis made by the French ; -when this is
done, it will follow, 41 that an impartial
and unequivocal "neutrality between ths
contending parties is our duty"âbut while
things remain as they do, and every ad
vantage is taken of us by ihe Britilh, in
>ur commerce, and our frontiers are held
by them contrary to treaty, an ast of im
partiality, is an ait cf " perfidy" to the
French nation.
This writer, though a pretended advo
cate for impartiality, isinfaÂ£t partial in fa
vour of the Englijh. The reflection thrown
on the French, as to their -'errors and
crimes," their frantic enthusiasm, and im
probability ot their success," are all the
eifufions of a mind prejudiced againlt their
rising republic. But the errors and crime:
of Britain and the r sanguinary measure:
throughout every part otthe world where
ver the British flaj has been difplaye'd art
topics which this impartial writer
lo fupprtfs.
The author does not wilh usto be enga
ged in the prefeut war ; but while the
n itions of Europe are aliening their right"
and vindicating their honor, he is defirou:
that the United States fliould not be inat
tentive to theirs. \Ve have now an op
portunity to aflert our claims, and main
tain the dignity and independence of oui
government, against the arbitrary, uijwar
i antable proceedings of the Britilh. It i
our " duty" to act with resolution, anc
no longer submit to the indignity, whicl
for so many yeays we have experiepctt
from them. By t^ei;*-conduct we havi
been put to the expence of millions, by ;
war with the" Ijitl Â»ns, and millions more
will soon be expended in conference o;
their retaining our frontiers.
It may be enquired whether it is meani
that the United States should be engat'ec
intheprefent war againlt England ?âB)
no means. It is for out interest to keef
clear of war with any of the powers ol
Europe. Itisgood polKy to adheVe ftr'.ft
ly to the modern of nations ; but al
this may be done,a/'rf at the ja'>-e time vin
dicate the Jovereig ty and honor cf tht
States. We have an undoubted right tc
:lemand afnrrenderof our posts, a&reeabl)
;<> treaty, without becoming a party in the
prefeut war ; We are entitled to the poffef
iion of our own territory, and the privile
ges ot our internal commerce, let the con
cert among the nations of Europe be what
:hey may.
Their contentions ought not to make us
more inattentive toour "duty." If En
gland is engaged in a war with France, i:
thisareafon Â« hy we fliould relinquilh our
just claims ? Or fliould we demand a com
pliance with their treaty, is this any rea
son why they (liou)d conlider us as parti
r..ins in favour of France? We are willing!
that they Ihould vindicate their rights a
gainst any power whatever ; but at the
fame time, they cannot expert that we will
surrender ours, to accommodate them,
lftncre i any fault in this bufinel's, it is or
the lide of the EngliHi, as we only al}'. foi
that tÂ»*n'itory which they ought many
years since to ha'je J'urrenderecl. âWe de
mand a commerce which they have ?nono
polized for along while to our injury.
As t'ree, fovcrcign and independent
States, we have a right (without a bre.i'.!
of neutrality) to regulate our own inter
nal conduit- âWe have an undoubted right
tu give peculiar; advantages to nation
w\thin our irw>i ports. âIf one nation a;
war, will give us ccrtain commercial pri
/ileges, while the other refnfes them, we
lave a right to reciprocate the benefits,
md allow them exclusive advantages: For
:iltanceâall French prizes might be fold
hi our ports, free of any duty, while the
Englilh should be subject 10 such .rtjlricii
iins and duties as are thought proper
While we refrain aiding, .betting, or car
rying any articles which are deemed
contraband, we are ftriitiy neutral- But
[he internal regulations of our govern
ment. as they refpeft nations, upon the
principle of miprocty, mufb be admitted
consonant to the laws of nations, and can
not, in any sense, be considered as other
wise.
Upon the whole, if France and Englanc;
are to be coufidered on equal terms, the
latter mil ft firft place themselves on equal
terms with us. They mult qualify them
selves for such treatment, by coming for
ward on the fame liberal ground with the
French, by giving the f.-.me encouragement
to our navigation and commerce, and bj
quitting our frontiers. Let them show ti
dii'pofition equally as friendjv as the French
and the fame advantages will be granti'J
them within our ports. But till this is done,
though we mean to adhere to a stria neu
[Total No. 163.]
crality, according to the modern ill age of
nations, yet it is our dutv". to give ex
clusive privileges in the sale of , mtrchan
dize, &c. to I'uch nations as are disposed to
ailiit our navigation and commerce. '

On Friday afternoon last, the

SIR, ' .
The citizens of Philadelphia are anxious
to convey their congratulations upon xour
arrival, in terms the moll cordial and ac

people of France ; but, at this moment, we.
are peculiarly gratified, by recognizing in
the Mipifier of ot'.r firit and be ft ally s
representative of a free republic,
Imprefied with the value of our political
independence ; recollecting, >vitli an honest
pride, the glory and success, which in pin-"

which so generonfiy contributed to
the liberties of America, has, at lengtfri
cvith unparalleled magnanimity,
her own.
For such feelings, fir, welijve n?-

France with a paternal eye ; iympatoiling

idds to the force of our afi'eciian, and fen

Beaflured, therefore, that justly regard

The committee, preceded by the chair
man. and followed by anjinmenfe body of
citizens, walking thres a-breaft, having
arrived at the City-Tavern, were intro
duced to M. GENET, and after the accla
mations, as well in the house as iÂ» the
streets, had ceased, the address was deli
vered, at the close of which the house
and the streets again resounded with con
2ratulations andapplaufe.
M. GENET, evidently affe&ed with the
warmth of the public attachment thus con
veyed, as soon as silence was restored. de
livered an extempore reply, in terms that
touched the feelings of every auditor, and
of which memory can serve to give but a
very faint idea. He observed. that he
ivas not an orator, and should not at any
time affefl the language of eloquence, that
even, however, in uttering the genuine
and spontaneous sentiments of his heart,
on an Occasion so interesting and so flatter
ing, he experienced fonie embarrafiments
arlfing from his defective acquaintance
with the language in which he was about
to /peak, but this defect he was certain
freemen would readily excuse, if they
were convinced of the sincerity of the
sentiments which he should deliver.
Pie then adverted to the address,
and acknowledged in the most pathetic ex
preflions, the sense which he and his fellow
citizens rauft entertain in finding so noble
an avowal of the principles of the revolu
tion in France, and so cordial an esteem
for her citizens, existing in a country, for
which (he had spilled her blood, disbursed
her treasures, aad to which file is allied by
tne dearefl fraternal sentiments, and the
moftimportant political interefb," France,
Continued M. Genet, is furiouuded with
difficulties ; but her cause is meritorious,
It is the cause of mankind and mnli pre
vail. With refpeA to you, I will declare
ope ily and freely, for the minister of a re
public should have no secrets, no intrigue,
that from the remote lituation of America
and other circumstances, she does not ex
pert that America should become a party in
the war, but, remembering that (lie has
already combated for your libertiesâand
if it was neceflary, and she had the power,
would cheerfully again enlilt in your cause,
we hope, and every thing I hear and fee
allures me our hope will be realized, that
her citizens will be treated as brothers in
danger and distress. Under this imprefli
on, my feelings at this moment are inex
preflible, and when I transmit your ad
dress to my fellow-citizens in France, they
will consider this day as one of the happiest
of their Infant Republic."
It is impossible to describe with adequate
energy, the scene that succeeded. Shouts
and salutations were not unancompanied
xvith other evidences of the effeÂ£t which
this interesting interview had upon the
paiUons of the parties who were engaged
in it. From the citizens in the room. M-
Genet turned h's attention to the citizens
who were aflembled in the streets, addref
fingthemina few, but emphatic senten
ces froin one of the windows.
The committee having thus discharged
the duties of their appointment, took "an
affectionate leave of M. Genet, and re
turned with their fellow-citizens in peace
and order. Every man who had joined in
the address, departed with this virtuous
and patriotic fatisfaÂ£tion, that he had at
once teftified his gratitude to a faithful al
ly, in the hour of her distress; and de
monstrated his attachment to those repub
lican principles, whicli are the basis of the
American government.
At 12 o'clock on Saturday morning, M.
Genet, agreeably to his intention previous
ly expressed, delivered in writing to the
committee, a copy of the following ans
wer to the address.
Citizen Genet, Minister Plenipotentiary
from the republic of France, to the Citi
zens of Philadelphia.
CITIZENS,
IF gratitude be not acknowleged a vir
tue among despots, it is evidently such a
mong freemen. Of this truth I have re
ceived abundant proofs, on my journey
from Cahrlefton to Philadelphia. In eve
ry place the general voice of the people
convinced me in a most sensible manner of
their real sentiments and sincere & friendly
dispositions towards the nation which I
have the honour to represent, and for the
advancement of that common cause which
(lie alone fnpports with Co nuich courage.
Citizens, your addrcfs has completed my
fatisfaftion, and I assure you that the day
your brethren in France fliall reccive it,
will be a day of gladness to them. This I
anticipate, that from the effect it has had
upon myfelf, it will have the fame up
on them, from those wife and liberal
sentiments, those just and excellent ideas,
which are its chara&eriftics.
In my private capacity of a citizen, I am
highly flattered with the favourable opini
on you have formed of me; and I promise
to make every exertion in my power to
render myfelf worthy of that good opinion
& to |uftify the confidence my conntry has
reposed ill me. My conduit while among
you fliall be to the height of our national
political principlesâAn unbounded open
ness shall be the constant rule of my inter
course with those wife and virtuous men
into whefe hands you hava intruded the
management of your public affairs. I will
expose candidly to thein the great objects
on which it will be our business to delibe
rate, and the common interest ps both na
tions will, I have no doubt, be the compass
ofourdireition ; for without such a guide,
what would become of both France and
America, exposed as we mutually are tc
the resentment, the hatred, and the trea
chery of all the tyrants of the earth, who,
you may reft afl'ured, are at this moment
armed notonly against France, but against
liberty itfelf.

On the fame day, a Committee appointed

SIR,
THE German republican society of Phi

are defended, Ihould be among the firft in

with pain and horror the confederation ol
all European despots against freedom, theii
united efforts to supersede thegeneral wil<
of France; but though foes encompass hei
brave sons, we trust that the arm nerved by
liberty will be invincible, and that the mil
lennial of political happiness is opening it;
profpetts upon them. The combinations ol
the sovereignty of the people are the only
security for general liberty and happiness,
and we flatter ourselves these will be at
length so well understood, as to fix the
rights ofman upon an immoveable balis, and
that the French nation will give an exam
ple to the European world, of rulers and

Philadelphia, May 17th, 1793.
To which the Ambaflador returned the
following
ANSWER:
To the German Republican Society o!
Philadelphiaâ
Citizens,
I HAVE had the fatisfaftion of spending
several years of my life among the people
of Germany,and during myftay with them,
knew how to esteem and refpeft those in
dividuals, whom the abfiird prejudices of
birth, and the difgraceful habits offlavery,
had not entirely estranged from humanity.
It was ever my opinion, that this great na
tion would enthusiastically rouse itfelf to
vindicate and maintain with invincible
ftrmnefs, the sacred flame of liberty, as
soon as it could free itfelf from the incum
brance of its monftrotis constitution : That
desirable event has not yet, however, ta
ken place. The lioftf ofdefpots that have
pofleffed themselves of the sovereignty of
the German people, still continue to rivet
their chains upon them : I am convinced,
however, my opinion is well founded, not
withstanding, and that Germany will yet
be FREE.
The republican sentiments that animate
the hearts of all those I have had an op
portunity of feeing beyond the limits ol
their own unfortunate country, are a con
vincing proof to me, that this will be the
cafe ; and under such a view of things, ft)
important to the sincere friends of huma
nity, I cannot express how much your ad
dress has excited my sensibility.
I lhall miflce your sentiments known to
my fellow citizens, and haveno doubt they

To the Editor of the National Ga.
ZETTE.
A S many persons, from diffance of time,
may have forgotten the terms of our
treaties with France, it may not be amiss
for you to re-publifb the 17th, 21ft, 22d,
and 23d articles of the Treaty of Amity
and Commerce between this conntryand
France, made the 6th of Fehruary 1778.
It is the intereff and duty of the United
States to preserve a neutrality between the
belligerent powers of Europe; but it (hould
be remembered that this neutrality can
only observed by our conforming to the
treaties we have made. With Great-Bri
tain we have no treaty but the treaty of
Peaceâwith other nations, and particu
larly with France, we have treaties of
Amity and Commerce. None of these
treaties require us to involve ourselves in a
war to support the quarrels of other na
tions ; but the breach of treaty with any
nation may be the means of involving us in
war with that nation.

To the EDITOR of the NATIONAL
GAZETTE.
THE genuine difplav of affeCHon r ifve
cause of France, by the citiz^;on the
arrival of the minister, has once more a
bashed ariflocracy, and hailed i â ;i. a! ; ty tri
umphant. The boforas of m: . v hundred
freemen beat high with affectionate tratif
port, their fouls caught the ce'.tilial fire of
[trnggling liberty, and in the enthuliafm of
emotion, they communicated their feelim/i
to the worthy and amiable rejÂ»refeniati\e.
of the French nation. What a delicious
repaftfor a mind interested in the cripfe of
humanity! There is something ennobling
even in the contemplation of liberty ; but
the energy of philanthropy, which its pre
lence imparts to the foul, exalts and puri
fies human nature. Incommunicable and
incomprehensible as this is to the well-born
of the earth, it is not less difficult than.the
aflimilation of virtue and vice. We have
an amphibious kind of char*Â£ler, which is
neither pofl'eli'ect of qualities to give it dif
tinfiion, nor modelly enough to mike it
content with the humble vale of equality,
that sickens at every exhibition of the so
vereignty of the people ;thefe.like the ani
mal plant, fhrinkfrom their approach, into
the clcft of infignificance. â May they ever
hide their djminifhed heads 1
The contrast, which (he conduCf of the
citizens, friends to the cause of freedom,
formed with that of the merchants, who.
Simulated by the fordid considerations of
felf-intereft alone, had the moriefty in
their own names and with their own Jet j'e,
to speak the sense of PENNSYLVANIA,
mulf give a charm to the characters of the
one, while it reflects dishonor upon the o
thers. The nilk a'ld water produ&ion of
sycophancy, which was carried in procrjft
on, was as delfitute of energy, as devoid
ofdignified and manly exprefiion, as the
motives which produced it were devoid of
the genuine spirit of liberty It was a cli
max of weakness and of fertility. Penn-- 1
fvlvania has not yet depreciated so far from
the character which she sustained durijig
the late revolution, as to fifffer the nobie
feelings of gratitude to be entombed in
Britifli influence and Britifli corruption,
and to prostrate the republican charaClerat
the shrine of Plnttts. Let the mercenary
band, who balk in the fun-ftiine of court
favour, and who, in the accumulation of
wealth, forget the dignity of man, and the
fsvage character of the people around
whom they entwine themselves, and 'iie
barbarous means they used to bend our
necks to the iron yoke of Britain, let !'u m
declare themselves neutral, neutral to e
very feeling but that excited by money;
let them declare themselves opposed to
countenancing the French Republic ; but
let them remember, that in so doing, a
sentiment so ungrateful, so unworthy,
reaches not beyond the limits of mercantile
apathy, or of Biitijli influence. âEroclcy
motions unfanftioned by preceding law:,
and procefiions of merchants, are equally
indifferent to freemen, when opposed to
the rational dictates of the head, and the
warm impiilfe of the heart âThanks to
our God, the foiiereig'ity flill resides with
the PeoPle, and that neither pro-l.i
mations, nor royal demetnor and J'ate can
prevent them from exercifirg it. Of tli'-
the independent freemen of this iretrop oi s

joined by proclamation, or in other words
indifference to the French cauff. or if yon
please, an equal affeCtion for all the belli -

receivers of proclamatorV principles, nor
to be deterred by them from acting as be

cession to congratulate the mjnifier, sup
ported the tottering fabric of liberiv a
gainst the machinations of such wretches,
who fancy themselves of a gender too per
fect to herd with the people, and at this
moment sustain the virtue andindepei.-H ' ce
of the American character. â Are there any
fellows in a freegovemment but those who
tranfgi ess the laws, ox thoje-v.ho apply the
degradii g epithet to the people ? T he man
who confpiresagainft his neighbour's rights,
and the man who attempts my life or
plunders me of my property, are fellows
alike \ they ate both murderers and rob

to undervalue the ft rvit es of those whole

eftabliihment of the republicâUninfluen
ced by resentment againit one, or detraction
from the other, I (hall with candour inves
tigate their principles and expole their at
tempts âI fnall begin with those to whom
I last alluded.
When the American revolution com
menced, all who advocated it did not aÂ£t
from a love of republicamfm or a hatred oi
monarchyâit was nor against the princi
ples of the government that many were
>ppofed,but igainlt the arbitrary measures
of George the thirdâof this description
were many of the leaders of the revolution
âThey were men who disdained the idea
ot a foreign yoke, and cxpected to raise for
themselves honors and dignities which they
could not hope for under the former go
vernment âLet faÂ£ts (peak for what I ad
vance. No sooner were the enemy driven
from our country, then arillocrntic princi-
began to appear, by the inflitution ot
:i i hereditary or.ler ;b it ilie genius of re-
Hibiica nfu) was on the watch, and the pro
jjet was dropped. A society was then in
tituted which does honor to the benevo
e ice of its members. Shortly alter pam
jhlets and publications were iflued frun:
.he nigheft authority, in order to (hew tin
uecellity of civil diliinitions. Rcpublicai
principles of government were treated a
:he vilions of ih-oretical politicians, or the
pretexts of deligning demagogues.â-1 he
ojell born and the ballances were then re
ceived with difgult and abhorrence ; noi
,vill the paneoyncks of fyropliants in Ame
rica, or the applaules of the Attorney Gen
eral of England, reintlate t d/jti'.guijhea
per/an in the gene. al confid. nee of his fel
low citizens âDefeat and difappoimment
do not always beget fulmiflion; ambition i
ever on the watch to fe.ze the moment it
forward its views.
The persons to whom I firfl alluded are
tnofe whom our clemency permittee! to re
main among us during the war, and other .
whom a more miltaken lenity permitted tt
eturn amon,; us lince the peace, and wen
well knoMii under the denomination 01
cories. Without enlarging by a d ffe tation
ju such perfo/is, the bare mention o. whom
uuft excite indignation, I (ball only re
mark that a coalition has taken place be
ween the tories of seventy-six, and the
American nobility of eighty-nine. The
jafis of this famous coalition was, that one
party Ihould make luch conceflions as would
forward the views of the other. It was
:hus that the trade of this country has been
"tcrifked to Britain, while her friends ha\ e
promoted the plans of certain aspiring men.
New fyltems in politics have been introdu
ed, and our government assimilated to that
of Great Britain, as nearly as pofiible.
It is some what remarkable how conge
nial the lentiments of the former tories,
rbe British in tine counti y, and tliofr of the
funded interert are with : efpect to French
fan ; as far as my observation has ex
ended, I t an make no exceptions, for they
ire all enemies to the freedom of France
the caufcs of this harmony offemiment
we will not invefligate, but I trul> the
truth of the position w'lll not be deniedâ
but fbould an exception to this rule b.
found, I will ask pardon, though 1 (han
no: forbear to exclaim rara ami in tern
Li 'roque firyiillima cygno.
It is now high time for the republican;
to watch the conduit of this coalition âIt;
measures will jultify more than suspicion.
L has p iflefled itfelf of prt fies that are de
i 1 ited to its views, and which are made the
echoes of British ministerial papers. I dial 1
make no alluiion to any particular paper,
but I will venture to aflert that the paper
which is subservient to such baJe purpose;
u unworthy of the patronage of republics*!
Americans. In a word, the enemies o:
Frcuch freedom are equally our enemies,
and equally merit our resentment, and
Towever they may flatter themselves, I
uuft they will find that America and
Prance have one common interest; in-de
pite of the intrigues of Britifli emissaries
ind American arillocrates to divide us."

A writer in the American Daily Adver-,
tifer sums up the following probable confe
rences of the United States taking part !H
he present war between France and Greas
Britain. 1. A ftidden and great diminu
tion of the exports and imports of theUni
ed States, e. The reduction of the f riccf
jf wheat from 8/4 to 2/6 per bulhel. 3.
An increase of the price of all impc ts. SÂ»ls

imong all clafl'es of our citizens, from the
ofsot fathers, husbands, brothers, and fops,
who would perith in battle, or in military

ipon our farms to pay it. 8. A revival of

dv the late war, and which are now nearly

**Â» Several communications We axe
obliged te defer to our jiest.Philadelphia, May 22.
On Fri<! ay last, the fallowing address was
present ed by the Merchants and Tra
ders of Philade'phia, to the President of
the United States:
GEORGE WASHINGTON, Prudent
of the United States;
SIR,
SENSIBLE that nothing is wanting to
the happiness of the people of the United
States, but to continue in pi ace, under
their Â»-xc llent laws and government, the
M chants and Traders of the city of Phi
ladrlp ia, beg leave to exprefc to you, the
hit;h fcnfe they entertain of the wisdom
and goodness which didlated your late
Proclamation ; declaring the leutralitv to
be obfervedby the United States, in the
war, wherein several European powers
are now engaged ; a war which, however
it might serve the interests of their com
merce, for the time, they, as the friends
of all men, and of all nations, are bound
to deplore.
Impressed too with an opinion, that in
an unoffending conduit towards all the
world, consists the true policy of America,
it is their determination, not only to pay
the regard to the Proclamation
themselves, but to difcoiintenance, in the
molt pointed manner, any contrary dispo
sition in others; examples of which, they
are perfiladed will seldom occur ; the fen
roentsjuft expressed, being, as we have the
fatisfa&ion tÂ« find, the common language
of the citizens of Pennsylvania.
Signed by about three hundred of the principal
Merchants and "Traders of the city oj
Philadelphia.
To which the President made the follow
ing reply:
To the Merchants and Traders of the
City of Philadelphia.
Gentlemen,
FULLY persuaded that the happiness
and belt interests of the peode of the Uni
ted States will be promoted by oberving a
ftrift neutrality in the present contest a
jnong the powers of Europe, it gives me
pleasure to learn, that the measures which
I hive taken to eclare to the world, their
disposition on this head, has given general
fatisfaflion to the citizens of Pennfylva
nia. Ihe friends of humanity will depre
cate war wherever it may appear: and we
have experienced enough of its evils in this
country, to know, that it should not be
wantoi ly or unnecefianly entered upon.
I trust, therefore, tint he good c tizrns
of the United States will (hew to the
world, that they have as much wisdom in
preserving peace at this critical juncture,
as they have heretofore dilplayed valour in
defending theirjuft rights.
(Signed) G. WASHINGTON.
Extra 3 of a letter from London, dated
March 18.
Our ministers, by yielding to the re
peated offers of negociation made by
France, might have prevented the inroad
into Holland, o r at least have taken ef
fectual mtafures for its defence, before
bring ng the nation to an open rupture.
Inllead of that, we ha>'e forced the Dutch
into hoftije measures, when they wilhed
to maintain a neutrality ; and as er Du
mourier had begun his operations, only
two thousand mm were sent over in ves
sels, utterly unprovided for the voyage ;
and in all probability to die of agues in
the morafies of Holland "
Extras ef another letter from the fame place,
dated March loth, to a ptrfon in this
city.
" Every day brings more and more to
light, the late horrid defign3 of' the aris
tocratic party in Paris, and their co ad
jutor the Duke of Brunfwick. The ma
nifello of the said duke is doubtless well
known to you j but it is not perhaps so
well known, that the horrid threats it
contains were not meant to be executed
immediately by his army, but by fccret
intrigue in Paris. After the surrender of
Longwy and Verdun (thro' treachery)
the enemies of France supposed could
accomplilli a counteiV revolution more easi
ly by intrigue, than by a direst march to
Paris, where it was supposed the king had
a fufficient number of friends to crush the
patriots."
" Had not the divine vengeancc arrett
ed the blood-hound?, by means of the in
trepid Parisians, with the afliftance of those
true patriots, and almost inimitable he.
roes, the Federates of Marseilles, Francc
at this day would have been without a ca-
pital,without * fcgiflative affemblyswithont
a national convention, without generals or
armies & almolt every city without inhabi
tants, which had adopted the principle, of
he late revolution. Although Paris was to
be the <11 11 facrifice to this infernal intrigue,
there cannot be a doubt but every city,
own, and diilrifl, that had consented to
the fufpenlion, was devoted to similar car
nage ; and a* little doubt remains with me
that limilar afltmblages of coufpiratora
were convened in evety such city, town
and diftrift in 7rance, which had pub
licly declared their sentiments to be in
unison with Paris ; and that the success ol
the Parisian confpi>, cy was to be the fig
nal for all the tell to begin the fame I el
lifh orgies.â Such a general carnage wat
surely intended on the night of the loth ol
r792, as hiilory jiever yet re
corded ; and for the honor of God, the
good of the moral and rational creation ;
it is to be hoped hell, with all its cliofen
band of furies, will never be able, at thi:
or any future period, to efTed, nor the
pages of future hiilory evtr be ftainer
with recording. As to affairs in England,
a sudden and calamitous check has been
put to our prosperity by the absurd wai
we have entered into. We might by ar
open and cordial condatf, have declared
aim oft ary conditions to France; wt
might have made this country the empo
rium of the world ; and while every Uat<
and climate were contributing to oui
wea th, we m'gh by peaceable and quiet
reforms of exorbitant and opp effive offi
ces, have reduced in twenty years, two
thirds of the national debt, and th-rehy
have secured to our posterity a pre emi
nence over other nations, which hardly a .
Ny shock of adverse fortune could have
reached. All this was in our power, anc
it requ red only plain sense, candour, ant
integrity to have obtained it. But inftea':
of this, we liav fuffered ourselves to bt
cajoled by a set of vehement and malig.
nant spirits, enemies'to the temporal hao
pinefs of their species, who, having rank
prejudices t6 gratify, or who having talt
ed the fiucets ot former wars, pursued onl)
the gratification of their passions, and dc
notdifdain t e je uitical plan of obtaining
their purpose thn ugh popular delirium.â
Perhaps it may be a cons lation to us it
this fchem of dc-lution, that we are bttl
the fuffen-rs, and that we may indulge tin
usual urivileg of upes, in giving io oui
deceivers, the epithets they def rve."
