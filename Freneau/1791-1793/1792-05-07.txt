Mr. FIND LEY'S Speech, in the Hcrufe oj
Representatives of the United States, on
the Assumption of the. remaining State
t Debts.
DURING the progtefs of the discus
{ion in support of the refoldtion
it has been presumed by all the gentle
men on that fide of the question, thai
the irredeemable principal ingrafted or
the funding system, was an equivalent
\ for deferring one third of the debt foi
ten years, in short, that it was eqtfal tc
the original contrast 5 confaquentlj
that the funding system, including the
irredeemable quality, was a full dif
charge of the original obligation, anc
that the amendment now under debate,
if adopted, would be a breach of the
original contrast, and would operate
unjustly towards the public creditors.
in all tranfafctions in public life,
wherein I have been engaged, and the
public creditors concerned, I have
steadily attended to their honest claims,
and (upported their interests, agreeably
to the principles of the government :
In this I have acted with the fame in
dustry and zeal that I have exercised in
contributing to accomplifla the revolu
tion, frofn which these claims origin
ated. I have been attentive to the pre
j'ent funding system, in its progrels tc
existence, and in its operation and ef
fects ; and I did, and still do believe,
that the irredeemable principal was nc
equivalent for the departure from the
original contrast. lam also persuaded.
that it is inconfiftcnt with the original
contract, and contrary to the principles
of the constitution, and unsuitable tc
our political circumstances. With
refpeft to the firft, I know of no la\V
cxifting in any of the ftafes whereby 2
debt which the creditor can only reco
ver at a distant period, and in very
final! installments, is rendered more va
luable, than a light to recover it on de
mand, and all aÂ« 0..e timeâ'Sifpoftng o]
property, to be a:d for in in foments
and at a distant period, is common ir
this country ; bu: .n that c.fe the pri
vilege is supposed to be enjoyed by tht
debtor, for which he always pays ;
higher price. To piefume that putting
a man's just claims to prompt paymen
out of his own power, except in fuel
small portions and distant periods as h<
cannot reafoni-bly calculate upon re
ceiving, in thecourfe of one generation
nortofuch an amount at any one time
as can be applied to any valuable pur
chafe, is presuming contrary to reason
to the laws and the usages of the Unitec
States.
But it maybe answered, that the pub
lie creditors, as a party in the contrast
had a right to agree to such terms, i
they pleased ; and that they did agre<
to them is by their acceptance, in sub
scribing to the loan, teftified. It is no
pretended that the terms werepropofec
by the public creditors ; so far from this
â it iÂ« well known that many of then
rcmonftratcd against the terms of th<
funding system, and gave an ample tef
timony against the irredeemable qualit)
being an equivalent for deferring, or ir
other words, lowering the interest o
the debt.
Their acceptance of the terms is n<
proof of their voluntary approbation
it was not optional to them on impar
tial ground. Provision was made foi
the interest for fifteen years, and the ob
ligation made perpetual in favour o
those who fubfcrib;d ; and if I am noi
mistaken, the provision was afterward:
made perpetual : And what was the al
ternative in favour of those who did nol
accept ? Why they had a provision oi
four per ccnt, made for one year only.
Without any obligation for continuing
that provision, and without interest up
on their interest, as those who fubferibe
have ; and so recent and striking an in
stance before them of disregard to the
original obligation both in matter and

form, as is witrieffcd in the funding law,
was a discouraging circumftariceto those
who would have o'therwife preferred
retting their claim upon that ground.
In this situation interest and necessity
di&ated the propriety of accepting the
terms of the funding fyflem, not as an
equivalent for their claims, bat as the
bell they could get. That the original
holders accepted with relu&ance, and
remonstrated, we know, that many of
that description, as well as foreigners,
did not actcpt at all, is evident from the
question before us: the parties there
fore were too unequal for a ccnteft,
and the terms were too unequal witl
refpeft to security, to render the ac
ceptance a pioof of approbation.
The truth is, that the irredeemable
quality appears never to have been in
ended as a real or solid equivalent. 1
was wholly calculated to be a fubjetl o
peculation, which might draw the atten
tion of persons in thole countries, when
from the superabundance of specie capi
als, enormous national debts, and Ion;
labits in stock jobbing, speculation i
aeeome a feience. To promote this th<
innatural and novel diftinÂ£tion of part
which had no foundation in the con
:raft, and a variety and neceflary flue
uation in the comparative value, wa:
ntrcrduced. This diftin&ion and va
riety was well adapted to bean induce
tnent to the meritorious public credi
:ors, especially such of thetn as refidet
;n the country, to part with their cer
tificates.
The two thirds of two thirds, the <
per cents, the three per cents, deferrec
debt, &c. all in one certificate, which
fl-fc'a witli ;y;
obligation simply of 6 per cent, upor
the principal, until it was paid, is ft
much beyond his comprehension, tha
be prefers parting with it, to keeping
it on terms which he does not under
Hand, and which he conceives may witl
equal ease be changed again by thi
fame authority into other and more un
intelligible varieties. To this end it ha
corresponded to admiration ; few in
deed are the certificates now in th<
hands of original holders, of theagricul
tural class.
One leading advantage which the
promoters of the funding fyftsm fug
gefted would arise frqm its opera
tion, was a circulation of the revenues
to the more remote parts of the coun
try, in payment of interest, which hac
been previously drawn into the treafu
ry by duties, and had the fvftem beer
udapted to the genius and circumftan
ces of the people of the United States
this no doubt would have been its er
feft. and in this way a beneficial balancf
of circulating specie would havs beer
supported.
It was also suggested that the certifi
cates, when appreciated, would aiuimt
the form & use of a circulating medium
and in this way be as a substitute foi
money, promote the purchafmg of land
improving the country, and give a gen
eral spring to industry : and this faluta
ry effett a funding system, calculatec
and guarded suitably for that purpose
might also have had. But these impor
tant confequcnces have been complete
ly defeated by the irredeemability anc
other peculiarities of the funding fyf
tern : that the funding system wascalcu
latcd to be a field for speculation, wa;
the general opinion of people of reflec
tion when it was originated. Arte
what have been the eiTetts of its operati
on P Why, it has introduced the mofl
extravagant Combinations, promoted
fictitious credits, and by giving a facility
to flock jobbing, in all its varied forms,
has become an enormous and :uinous
snare. It has occasioned many of the
most enterprising characters to desert
the ufeful p.tths of industry : dilTipati
on, gambling, extravagant projects and
extravagant modes of life are promot
:d to such a degree as to be ruinous to
our morals ana degrading toour ration
al. chara&er. Wealtli hastily gotten,
without industry, has changed the
gtades of society andere&sd a new and
formidable interest iA the common
wealth. One week we behold fortune;
rising like exhalations, and the price 6i
fljor.fes blown up above all rcafonable
calculationâbut perhaps before the
next week arrives we find the stocks
fella fourth or a fifth, and dilappoint
ment, bankruptcy, and stagnation of the
most ufeful branches of commerce,
fpreadir.g ion'fternation far and wide,
the tales of villainy and confequenl
diftrels swell up the news of the day.
I hough I have not changed my opinion
of the funding system, since it made its
appearance, yet I confels its delusory
and eninarmg progress has been more
rapid, the bubbles have sprung up and
burfted in a greater variety and in quick
er fucccffion than I expected. General
eonfidencc and contentment among the
citizens has not been among the elFetts
produced by the irredeemability, and
the complex and mysterious forms of
the funding {yftem.
A principal advantage the funding
lyftem was to produce, was the lower
ing the rate of interest for money ; in
deed this was the principle upon which
it was supposed to be calculated : it was
to reduce the rate of interest to five 01
even four per cent, by its beneficial op
eration as a circulating medium &c. I
a/k fir, has it had fileeffeft ? No, it has
list, but the reverse. I acknowledge cer
tihcates have been purchased at a rate
t'iat would not afford five per cent, up
on the price given for therS, and that
even alter they were above parâRut
at the fame time the rate of negociable
interest rose to a usurious height .â¢ no
luch instances of usury were heard of in
this country at any former period, (ex
cept in th'c times of general distress and
bankruptcy occasioned by old debts,
lofles in the course of the war and an o
ver importation of goods at the conclu
sion of the war) and this has not beer
incidental, but the native effect of the
system. Negoaiable interest has roll
too high for the solid purposes of com
tnerce, and capitals and attention hav<
been withdrawn from it by the bauble
of the timesâand by the prevailiiu
fluftuationsinthe funds and private ere'
dit, the regular circulation of credi
and cash suited ;o commercial purpose;
;s obstructed. However I do not de
iiy but that importations are to as grea
afl amount as ever. I believe the amoun
is too great for tiie public good, but'thi
is not the result of the quantity, or higl
price of our exports, but it is the returr
for our certificates transferred toforeign
ers-to whom they are in the more efteerr
bccaufe of that irredeemable quality t<
whichlobjeftâln confequcnce of thi;
we become tributaries to foreigners, o
ver whom we hsve no controul, anc
from whose wealth we can derive no ad
vantageâthis evil has already prevail
ed to a great degree and by the prefenl
system can neither be remedied nor pre
vented.
I have said that the funding system is
inconsistent with the original contrailâ
this is evident from all its complex anc
mysterious division of parts and differ
ence of value which had no foundation
in the original obligation,many instanc
es of this might be adduced, but I will
only fete& one. The aQ. of Congrefi
provided for the redemption of the" old
continental bills of credit at 40 for one;
the funding system provides for it at the
rate of one dollar for the hundred, and
that dollar fubjeQ: to its divisions of
parts and value. Is not this a total de
parture from the contrast both in mat
ier and form P it is vain to answer, that
the Congress money had been consider
ed as loft, and had depreciated much
lower than one for forty ; the fanftion
of an ast of Congress supported by the
obligation of the constitution fixed it at
Numb. 55.
forty for one, and the fame power that
could alter it to one hundred for one,
could anihilate that or any original
claiifi altogether âI am not here treat
ing about the equity of the claim'sâbut
about the legillative authority of C6n
grefs to change contracts which they
were bound to fulfil, both by the aÂ£ts of
the old Congress, and an cxprefs ciaufe
of the constitution.
In preparing, and enacting the fund
ing law, Congress seems to have laid a
side the character of the legislator and
afTumed that of the judge, whereas their
inoft conlpicuous character in transact
ing that bulincfs Ought to have been
t'hat of a party prevailing for the pay
ment of their debts ; but in acting the
part of a judge they have taken it up
on an original plan, they have changed
the value and the principles of theclami'
by a mere act of their will, without be
ing guided by realons taken from the
original obligations, but have rather
been influenced by the contemplation
of the mighty political machine they
were about to erect, viz. an unextin
guifhable national debt, and cor.folidat
ed monied iritereft.
1 have al 'o laid that the n redeemable
quality of the funding system is contra
ry to the constitution. Congress have the
power of applying the public refourccs
towards paying the debts of the union;
every fuccefiivc Congress is equally
veiled with that power, it is derived
immediately from the conflitution to
=very Congress andnot derived through
the laws of one Congress to another; but
in the funding fyitem, the Congress
who enacted it have decreed that no
succeeding Congress shall pay the exist
ing debts of the United States, except
in certain small and distinct instalments
which perhaps would occupy two, or a
part of three generations to compleat f
certainly the present Congrels cannot
fay unto the next or any future Congress
that they shall not do what the constitu
tion expressly %s they have power to
do ; and yetif we reject the amendment
and adopt the relolution we are in fact
faying so ; if we do so we are holding
out a farther delusion to the citizens -
snares of t his kind have proceeded far
enough already, a future Congress cer
tainly will disregard this reflraint and
repeal the rriedeemable quality of the
funding system.
The creditors who hold those claims
for which we are about to provide have
an unquestionable right to & per cent,
interest upon the original claim, butnot
to inteiÂ»elt upon the interest, but to a
provision for extinguishing the arrears
of interest; all the different laws which
I know of contemplate a delay of pay
ment of interefl and expressly guard
against paying compound interefl. The
party to whom interest is due may claim
and recover it at short periods, but ix
it is not claimed or cannot be got, any
supposed ddaydoes not enable the cre
ditor to claim interefl thereon ; this
proves that legal interefl is supposed
in the law to be a fufficient compeufati
on for the delay of payment.
My firft design was to have moved to
amend the resolution lo as to provide 6
per cent, for the principal according to
contract, and have proposed some pro
vision for paying the arrears of interest,
but upon reflection I find the business
so far put out of its natural course alrea
dy that I have relinquished that design ;
the progress of innovation has beenÂ° so
great that it is difficult to tread back
the ground, therefore I will vote for
the amendment.
One difficulty which influenced me
to give up my firft design was, that not
only the arrears of interest which arose
since the firft of January, 1788, is fund
ed at three per cent, to those who sub
scribed to the loan, but also the indents
of interest issued previous to that peri
od under the confederation, which liad

Toward the latter part of last month 1
- things were driven to that extremity he
-11 tween the colonial aflembly and the gener
Â» | ral that it was. thought some tragic ftenes
n would : levitablv ensue. Whi'e the Â«ene
s rai was in' the midst of the colonial afiemhly:
â  endeavouring to juftify Himfeli agiinflfnn-i
e dry malignant charges, the populace wtaii-j
:s outdoor?, and even in the gallery of the;
- afiembly. with loud cr'.e- demanded li.i'sj
n head. âNothing lefo Id apparently fa-!
3 tlsfv the finguinary, many-headed moufter.
11 It was near three o'clock in the morning
e before the tumult was so far appeased as
>f that it was thought fafe for the general to
- retire to his house, though fttrrounded and
supported by 70 or 80 military officers.â
>f The expedient then adopted by the afl'em
e bly tofreftore tranquility, was arrogating to
n itfelf the sovereign authority by diverting
o the governor general of his command, and
y ordering him sent immediately to France
h under a charge of high crimes and mifde
n meanors. The next day all the commif
d fioned officers of the troops of the line fta
â¢, tioned here waited on the general with
- thfir resignations which they requeited him
e to lanftion, andalfo begg'd permission to ac
-0 company him home. Wlien an account of
- this tranfaftion was laid before the afiem
- bly, it leem'd to bring a majority of the
e members to their feafes a little. On n re
:r trofpeftive view of their recent resolves,
t, they found that they had far exceeded the
o legitimate limits of their aKthority, asd be
,â, to cl.-. nd ttJ cnf. qsencesthat might
result tÂ«| tUg colony acid to them individu
ally from so daring an insult offered to the?
luprenie executive of the nation. The
(till, small voice o f reafon began to elevate
i tic If, and a deputation was dispatched to
the governor general, (upplicating him to
bury the 'art n-:ercation in oblivion, and to
resume' the rein of government. A. mim-'-j
b,?r of refpec'f able citiz-'.is joined the circle
of military officers who still fnrroiinded the
general, and declared publicly that they
would leek for and endeavor to bring to
iu(lice those dark, defiini'.ng knaves, what
produced the recent in the
'populace, and would particularly endeavor
to d.fcover those fwgninary villains who
had the audacity to demand the general's
head. It was not without much persuasion
that M. de Hlanchejande was prevailed on
to comply with the requisition of the afleiri
bly. He obfcrved. that as that body had
j nfurped the power of vacating the governs
! meat, it mull be refpoufible for all
! quences. âHe wiflied rather to return to
> ranee and fnbmit his conduct to the i.ivef
tigation of Ilia superior*, than continue here
in the exercise of a precarious authority.â
where he is not only fubieft to be continu
ally vext by the mod flagrant inuances of
infflbordination, but must either be in a
continual llate of warfare with the colonial
alfembly, or fubjnit to the mortification of
functioning encroachments on the legiti
mate prerogatives.of the executive power,
j However, he at length yielded to' the re
| peited inflance- of tiie co-mriii'fioners who
addressed h Hi on this occaiion, and was ef
i corted down to-the hall of the aflembiy a
' mid ft the acclamations of a great number
' of sober citizens, who were known, and
! who declared the;' would support him in
| the due exercise of ail his functions. Since
: that day tolerably good order has prerail-
J ed. The general hasailnrned rather a bigh
'er tone with the aflembiy ; âand in my con
i'cience. to speak as a good commonwealth' -
i man, I think him perfectly jufKfiaWe in it.
| The co'onial ademblv lately apro-nted
, Tome rew corrtrr.iffior.ers from thrt body-to
j the national amenably of France, in order
'.j verbally to plead thecaufe of the colony, and
: to endeavor to arrest the contagion of those
' specious opinions injurious to it, which
. have been so indnflrioufly difiercioated by
some impolitic pretinders to philanthropy.
, Those commiflioners took their departure
the week before last. The altercation be
. tween Messieurs the National Commiflion
ers and the Colonial Aflembiy had arifsn to
t fucb a pitch, that there did not appear the
o leart probability that the object qf their
- minion would be attained in any reasonable
time. This, together with some personal
insults, I suppose induced M. Mirbeck to
-j abandon his purftlil and embark for France
e j fh r ee or four days after the colonial com
missioners. âM. St. Leger for months past
has been visiting the different parties at
. i Port-au-Prince, Croix-des-Bouqtiets, Le-*
n J ogane, and is said to be now at St. Marc,
.j His manoeuvres are not favorably viewed
â! by the colonics. M. Roume yet remains
here; but I understand the colonial aflem
r) bly refufes to hold any official comrnunica
e tion with hi.n ; âailedging that M. Mir
beck's departure for France abrogates in
j| the commission under which he at>ed.
The political dictionary of those gentlemen
feems to give a definition of terms very dif
{l erent from that of St., Dom'tngue. and the
n mrtizans of both are tenacious of ther ref
it pe&ive interpretations. A majority of the
c | colonists are disposed to dispute tiie exten
sive power which the commissioners- claim,
isi When M. St. Leger was lately at Port
au-Prince, it seems he thought proper to
e exercise his dittatoria'l authority by giving
-I particular directions to the principal offi
! cers of the military corps stationed there,
'â i'. which induced them to difobev the requisi
tions of the popular rnagiftrates.âThirty
of the principal military officers have been
â s lent round here in confluenceâ the colo
nial aflembiy have required the general to
ly: hold them under arrest, and fend, them by
l-l the earliest opportunity to France, there to
i-j trke trial si r their misdemeanors. âTwo
ej daysfince the governor-general fignined to
isj the aflembiy, that he had come to a deter
i-l mi nation to takehis departure immediately
â¢ j for France. The most refpetlable citizen ;
g of the Cape, apprehenHve that the word
isl consequences would result from the gene
â¢oj ral's departure at this critical moment, ex
idi erted themselves to prevent it by the most
â| loyal representations to him, andfreiterated
i-i promife.s of their firmeft support in the cx
:o! ercife of his legitimate authority. M. de
ig Blanchelande, in consequence, went thir day
id to the colonial aflembiy, accompanied by a
:e great number of the citizens of the Cape,
and made a manly and pointed address,
f- wherein he represented how much his ope
i- rations had been cramped by the injudicious
th and illegal interference of the aflembiy â
in expreft his hopes that in future it would
e- confine itfelf within due bounds, and eu
ol' deavor to fulfil the purposes of its inftitu
a- tion, âotherwise he Ihould be under the
iie necessity of diflolving it, being aflured of

Some late advices from Spain mention con

AS soon as the Congrefi {hall adjourn we
' have to expect from thafe faithful patrons
I of good government, order, and the funds,
| a pious and lengthy panegyric upon its vir-
L jtuous deeds. This has heretofore been
' the cafe, and surely those beneficent para
j graphifts who have been fa Copious on
II former occasions, will not fuller the merits
|o f the prefont feflion, to pafi unnoticed
jj The puffing of its friends has been found of
j importance to public bodies as well as to
' individuals, ana ought not to be omitted,
especially in cases of emergency.
I Compared with the atchievtnents of their
I predeceflors, it is true, but little has been
!! font. By their labours a fyllem beautiful
i in theory and delightful in practice had
] been reared. Not only the outline of the
edifice was formed, but most of its parts
executed ; the last p'Jlar of the Corinthian
i order only remained to be added. From
: this feflion it was expeÂ£ted the finilhing hand
â¢I would be given it.
l] But let the candid public take circutri
: (lances into confederation before they de
i cide on their relative merits. The labour
> of their predecefTors was easy. They were
: fanned by a prosperous gale : Planned and
i executed without opposition. But in the
. pfeTent, the cafe was widely different.
. Some unfkilful artists had been taken from
( < the country, of unpolilhed taste, groveling
genius, and whose education had been
. formed upon a local, narrow and fordid
, i fca!e. 1 hefe, (afTociated with tiie form
( er difaifefted, for such there were) be
j :n g pnt to this last part, had like not only
jto have conftrufted ft on entire different
â , principles, but with more than Gothic bar
iiaritv attempted to remodel the whole
l building ; jailing upon, and cutting and
| lucking it in various parts, so as almofl to
Jdeface its form. The faithful labourers
therefore of the present feflion, have flood
on entire different ground and had difficul
ties of a novel kind to encounter. That
they have been able to preserve f rom ruin
what had been already done, must be a
j matter of fu'prize. and entitles them to
â¢ gratitude and applatifo*
'Tis to be presumed tb? next feflion will
| complete the work. These daubers will
in the mean time be taken into training,
and well tutored, otherwise the enterprize
iiiufl be abandoned. To leave the edifice
in an unfinifhed state, whilst the workmen
are contending about the mode, will ex
po.'e it to the weather and endanger the
whole building. Not only the foundation
will gradually decay, but the idle mob ga
j thering round these will proba-
I bly take fidewith thj ignorant new pro;eÂ£t
;ors, and tear it to pieces. Better will it
be to close the breaches in any manner, than
hazard these conferences.
Infaftift.be rendue of the state debts
are not afTunied, and therebv the funding
system enc reafed ti> the utmost poflible ex
tent, out little benefit especially to the au
thors, npon any of its principles, will be
gamed by what has been already done. For
let it be remembered, that part gains have
been laid out in futwe acquirements, and
that ruin must o'erwhelm many if it should
fail.
The time is now come, that prope~ dis
tinctions should be made on important po
litical subjects. The cloud of error must
be dispelled or the consequences will be fa
tal. 7he people of America have got state
governments, and against whose adminif
tratiens they may clamour as much as they
please. They may pnt them up and pull
; them down, make and unmake rulers at
their pleasure, and we shall not interfere '
with them. Is not this a fufficient indul
gence, a fufficient field for licentiousness to
range on P why will they not exercifi equal
liberality toward us of the federal ? why
not allow us in peace to make it what we i
please ' surely they have nothing to do

7 3Â°- 1 66 I â Claud*,been disposed of and provided for by
requisitions ss fully as the powers or
laws of that government permitted : â
Many, indeed I believe moll of the
Rates, had made adequate provision for
them to their refpeftive citizensâand
those who did not were under the fame
obligations to do it that they had been
to do any other part of federal duty in
the course of the revolution ; even these
have been revived again and funded at
three per cent. The indents, and about
three years interest which became due
fin.ee the hi ft of January 1788, making
in all above ten millions, have been
fundedâabove seven millions of these,
if it was not a debt created by the fund
ing system, received a refurreftion by
it ; this will explain the charge of cre
ating a new debt asserted by one of the
gentlemen, and denied by another ;
here were above seven millions receiv
ed, which ought to have been consider
ed as redeemed, unlcfs perhaps in a few
instances, to such as were not citizens
of any dateâand above three millions
funded at three per cent, for the doing
of which there exiftcd no obligation.
If it be answered, that equity required
it, I will alledge that it the Congreis
were to ast on the general claims of
equity which originated in the course of
the revolution, a much greater amount
misft yet be provided for. I never
knew a public creditor who expected
interest upon his interest, or that ex
pelled the indent debt that had been
disposed of, to be received orotherwile
provided for than by a final settlement
between the refpeftive states and the
United States. Why Ihould they ex
pect Congress to make provision where
an actual obligation did not exist, when
in the fame act they were destroying ten
vears interest of one third of the prin
cipal, where the most express obligation
did exist, and where the claim was al
so founded in the strictest equity ? This
increase of the debt, and funding at
three per cent, appears not to have been
calculated for fthe profit, nor at the re
quest of the public creditors ; for what
they gain in the one hand they lose in
the other : neither does it operate as a
gain to the United States. If we may
judge of its object by its effects, we may
observe that by receiving the indents
redeemed by the states, an increase of
revenue becomes necelfary, and the
btCOTlt lite pensioners to Con
gress for the annual amount they are to
receive ; thus the revenue must be the
greater in thÂ« hands of those who con
duct it, and the individual states must
be dependent on the treasury of the
United States for the means of their
support; foreigners may make reprisals
if they are not paid, nor does the sup
port of their government dspend upon
it ; but this is not the cale with de
pendent itates. We know several oi
the states are in this way entitled to a
(rreater annuity than is necelfary foi
the support of their governments, and
the people are in the habit of living
wholly free of state taxes ; while to ac
compltlh this strange state of things
the debt of the union is incrcafed, obnox
ious revenues are rendered necelfary,
ministerial influence, speculation, anc
consequent depravity arc advanced.
With respect to the dangerous ef
fects which the irredeemable principa
and unnecessary increase of funded ca
pital will have upon the genius of oui
government, and the interest of poste
rity, this subject has been investigated
with so much ability by the gentlemer
who were up before me in support oi
the amendment, that I will not now
detain the committee with any thought:
upon it, but will conclude with obferv.
ing that, having proved that the irre
deemable principal which the amend
ment is defignea to correct, is not ar
equivalent for the departure from the
terms of the contract, and that beinj
contrary to the constitution cannot beob
ligatory on any future Congress, but i:
dclufory in its nature, and calculated t<
promote speculation & a transfer of th<
debt to foreigners ; and that the increafs
of funded debt created in the funding
system, was not necefl'ary from the ori
ginal pbligation, nor profitable to the
public creditors, but calculated foi
dangerous speculating and political pur.
pofss. I will fit down with exprefling 2
wifh,that, by adopting the amendment,
we will prevent the worst effects of the
funding system from being further ex
tended.

ty, which to the n okls-minpkp, is the worst
slavery : And whereas the aimers at so happy a
hange in the government of our country, are
ind have been much at a loss touching the ways
ind means of providing a set of men, of fuir.cierit
wealth, merit and fplendur, to form an hereditary
ind titled orderj the following plan, for that pur
jofe, is hr.mbly offered to public confederation,
oy a citizen who has employed his thoughts on
hat all-important fubjeft, and dares Hatter him
felf, thai hia plun, if adopted, will, in providing
as manv nobie lords as may be wanted for this,
it prelent, poor plebeian country, be productive
it many other and great benefits to the lame.
THE PLAN.
LET a lift be made of all the speculators, as
A-ell in as out o.f the government, who have been
>.udent enough to enrich themfefves in the sum
tf 150,(8)00 dollars at the leatfâJt is then propo
edÂ»
j. Th3t to each speculator, having not lels
han 150,000 dollars, nt r more than 200 s 000,
:here shall be added (either by free grant from the
reafury, or by some douceur equal
:hereto) as much ai will make up 500.000.
2. To each speculator, having not less than
z.oc,coo, nor more than to br added in
ike way, as much as will make up 450,000.
To each speculator, having not less than
300,000, nor more than 450,000, as much *.$
.vill make up 6c0,c00.
4. To each speculator, having not less than
1.50,000, nor more than 600,c00, as much as will
nake up 800,000.
5. To each speculator having a million and
jpwards, nothing to be added.
The said estates to be entailed in the mail line,
.urfuant to the right or primogeniture j aftd the
ntcreft accruing thereon to be made fare to the
said speculators and their heirs forever, by perpe
ual taxes unalterably appropriated, and quarterly
payable to their use.
The noble speculators of the lowest rank or
;rade, to be Ailed, " the order of the Leech/'
Their title to be Their Fulnefi'es." Their arms,
4 A Leech, clinging to the bowels of an old fol

The noble speculators of the next rank, to be
[Viled, *' The order of modern Justice." The

The noble speculators of the next rank, to be
Viled, " The oider of tfye virtuous League." Th*.

with a Brokerâin the mouth of the former, a la

mouth of the latter, a label, * And I'll be
uuying up the FINALS." The motto, ** Public

nore fuitabie, #< The Order of the GoldenFltece."
The title, " Their Pirate-ships." The arm-.,

Manyfold and great will be the advantages inci
dental to this, so generous a plan.
ift. As it will Simulate diligence and ingenuity,
by so great a reward to cit'uens who have so exer
cised these virtues as to poflefs thcmfelves ol th:
wealth of the country at the lead poiiible expencc.
2. As it will encourage liberty of confcicnce,
by conferring honors and revenues on the men whe
have nobly dared to fhxke off its yoke.
3. As it will improve mftralit), by recommend
ing a latitude in dealings, which our narrow,
minded forefathers never dieamt of.
4. As ic will encreafe the artificial energy ol
the government, by combining avarice with ambi
tion in the administration thereof j so as tc
ftrcngthen the motives and the means of a power
ful set of men, to refill and keep down the inso
lent republican spirit of the people. For a land
ing order of nobility, thus twitted into the govern
ment, will be more to be relied on, than an)
landing army whatever, of mere Plebeians, as i:
evinced in the cafe of the French revolution,
that detestable subversion of the noble preroga
tives of the few in favor of the vulgarrights of tin
many.
5. As it will faften the better the bleflings o
an irredeemable debt. For as the taxes for th<
debt will keep the people obedient and sober, th<
Nobiilty,mounted on the debt, will perpetuate th<
taxes on the people, and fu perpetuate both theft
bleflings.
This idea of founding a nobility on a funded deli
is perfectly an original invention, and r IC
less ingenious than important* the author hopes
to be rewarded with a special adl of grace, admit
ting him to rank in the " Order of Modern Jus
tice," if no higher. If not so rewarded, hi
hereby gives notice, that he infifls on his right :c
a patent.

it deserveÂ«, he intends to complete the idea bj

FRENCH NEWS.
[From the Leyden Ga~ctle.\
Paris, Feb. 5.
The Sieur de Sainte Croix, minister of Franc
at the Electorate of Treves, has taken the great
ett care to fee that the orders for dilperfing th
French emigrants, heretofore patronized by th'
Prince-3ilhop of that electorate, ftoukd be faith
fully carried into efFeCt. In his last letter h<
announces that this dispersion wil] be as *ffe&u
al and complete as the nation could require, or
the king has ordered him to demand. He affigrn
the following reasons for this change of sentiment
in some foreign courts, viz. " The prudence an.,
moderation of the court of Viennaâdespair of any
effectual afiiftance from Prudia âthe wisdom 01
the general government of the low countriesâtin
further and more mature reflections of the EleCtor
of Treves. 1 ' The following is a draft of th;
orders of the EleCtor, with regard to the em'grant;
in his dominionsâl. All emigrant-military-corps
cf what denomination soever, are ordered tc
depart from this electorate [This order was striCt
ly enforced previous to the departure of the cou
riet j mod of the emigrants having departed, anc
others preparing to follows J All uniforms are striCt -
ly prohibited. [The horse are following th
foot, a body of cavalry going regularly off ever;
day, altho* the roads were in a shocking condi
tion, and covered with banks of snow. Their
principal places of retreat were, the territory ot
NafTui, Hefle, and some of the neighboring prin
cipalities. Not a few have returned into France.]
2. No arms or ammunition to be at the dispo
sal of the emigrants. [Accordingly, when theft
accounts came away, they were not poffefled of 2
finale cannon, and if any were found, they wert
under orders to fell themâtheir contracts withlht
gun-founderies, magazines, &c> to be held voL*
under the levCseft penaltiesâeven their provision
magazines were to be let up at public laic, lo thai
no'trice of any ftorei of lupplies for them might
remain.]
