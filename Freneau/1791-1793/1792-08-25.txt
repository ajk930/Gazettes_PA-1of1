THE speech of Mr. Chojscki, Nun
cio ot Kijovia, in the Polish Diet
oh the JCth of May, has been publilhed
at Waifaw. In the course of this animated
speech he obfervcd that ''Aullria and
Pruflia had constantly profefled, during
'the course of the present Diet, to have
favourable sentiments for them; it was
true they had formerly appropriated a
part of the territory of the republic to
themfclvss, but fati fied by these attain
ments, they had pnfhtd their ufurpaticna
r.o furtherâthey had not attempted any
thing againfl their civil liberty, and had
not influenced their Interior Adminillra
tionâlt was not, therefore, Austria or
Prussia, but Rufiia who threatened them,
a power, who, from time immemorial haa
been the sworn enemy of Poland, and who,
I fay, openly, and withont hesitation, has
forged fetters for us, and this I will always
tna'ntain, even if I should be tbe firft vic
tim of her resentment when war shall be
declared, and that (he covers me with her
vengeance by spreading ravage and terror
over rr.y estates, situated on the Frontiers.
I (hall fay : his, because in this sacred asy
lum of the defenders of the nation, it is
nor permitted to consider of private or
personal iiitereftsâand it would be infa
mous not to k'ive all pofiinle attention to
thepublic good, and not to (hew ouesfejf
with opennefa arid intrepidity, tha defender
of the country." He then proceeded to
fl.ew the preponderance Rullia has, ami
the oppressions flhe exercised, particular
ly in 'lie frontier Palatinates: he said
"RuiTu knew t)i .' 11"* Puiifti nitiuii had
ceafea to be undet her tyranny, and that
asthey now ranged among free nations, they
would throw a new weight into the bal
ance of EuropeâShe knows this, and Die
is jealous of our welfareâalready (he is
uraftifing 'he lame arts that she employed
formerly so fuccefsfully to trouble our
tranquility and subvert our liberty.â
Would to God my fears may not be real
ised I ti' mlJe lead the Emigrant Polan

wicked deligns ; and that by a ilrangc
"abui'e of words, Rullia (hall lay to us in

will not f 'm:i her to f-e,wtth an indifferent
eye, a change in the firm oj her government,

'1 he unprovoked attack of Rufiia onthe
independence and internal freedom of Po
lant-j constitutes a cafe in which it would
have well become Great Britain to have
jnterpofed her mediation. Unfortunjtely
the present minister having thought pro

and expose his own imbecility in a caule

RIOT AT EDINBURGH.
The llrougtft apprehensions were en
tertained that a riot would take place here
on hi:, majeftv's birth-day. An effigy of
Mr. Dmi das had been prepared, with an
intention to be burnt at the cross, by foipe
people who were difplcafed at his condud
in proposing only a gradual abolition of
the Slave Vrade, and opposing the Scot 9
Borough Reform.
The Mngiftrates underftxm ling thr:
such a measure was intended, iffiied orders
to prevent any mob from afftmbling, and
commanding all perfon3 to keep their
vaots and domcltics within doors on the
king's birth-day. But at the fame timi
they had ordered a ftu de joy, iUutr.iuati
ons, and such other demonftratiars of
public joy, as could not fail to excite (he
public curiosity to witness them. TlÂ»
â ynfcquence, it is easy to imagine, a
total disregard of the orders ifliieJ to
keep people at home.
An ancnymous letter, it is faiJ, was sent
io the ProvDlt, threatening to (hoot him
if he perlif.ed in opposing the burning of
â¢.he effigyâWhether this was the reason
we know not, but a regiment of dragoons'
was brought to town to keep the peace.
In the evening the people bccarjje riot
ous. The Magiftra.es paraded the Greets
attended by the city guard, and a party of
the 53d regiment, now quartered in the
caftlc here ---The mob increased, and the
dragoons were ordered to clear the streets,
in performing which ferviee, several peo
ple were rode down, which excited the
people to still greater outrages-
Afire was kindled, and several fentry
boX' S committed to the flames- -The riot
ast waÂ« then read, and about 14 people
taken prisoners, and conducted to the
castle, which restored order r ir the night,
but a spirit of discontent Hill seemed to ma
nifeft it ft If.
Friday night several people assembled
in a disorderly and tumultuous mann'er, in
New Gravel-lane Ratclitf Highway, w'tii
a fiddler playing before them, and a union
jack hoill;d upon a pole, and proceeding
into Elbow-lane, attacked the house of a
Publican, againll wijoui, it is supposed,
they had some private pique, which they
threatened to pull down and demolilh, and
which probably they would have effected,
had not a party of runners and peace of
ficers from the public office, Shadwell, ar
rived time enough to prevent any serious
mitchief. They secured about eighteen
or nineteen of the ringleaders, andbroiight
them before Jullice Bland.
In addition to the above, the following
has been transmitted to us by a corrcfpon
deut:
"Sir,
"On Monday, the king's birth day, it
was known to be the intention of many
to Ihew their dislike toDunda3, by burn
ing his effigy. Our sycophantic magis
trates, to prevent this disgrace to their
patron, and to gain 1116 favour, had three
troops of horse parading the streets by ten
in the morning. Thcsthe peaceable inof
fensive inhabitants, while going about
their lawful bunnefs, four.d themselves
under military law. At a time when there
was 110 croud in the llrect, r.or a dispositi
on to riot, the hotfe rode with great speed
and with drawn fwordu cutting and ilafh
ing on each fide to make the people rjif
perie , they even lode on the foot pave
ment. Many people could not get cut of
UÂ»e way time enough ; one man was
trampled to death and several wounded.
One gentleman, while in custody, was cut
ou the Ihoulder fcy a dragoon. One old
man by the name of Guile, felling milk
on the foot pavement, was thrown down,
and had both his legs broken. A little
boy fitting on the pavement with his legs
on the street, had his legs and fitt jammed
to a j.liy by the horses.
"On Puefday night some people aflem
bled in George's square, to effect their pur
pose of burning the effigy of Mr. Dundas;
but they were ruterrupted, This drew to
gether a mob. The Sheriff read the riot
ast, aud, on their refufal to difperfc, he or"
dered the soldiers to fire. Four men, u
painter, a ghziw, a mason, and another,
were killed ou the spot. Many were
much wounded, feveralin the infirmary,
two of whom are thought beyond recovery.
"On Wednesday night the mob afism
bled in great numbers, again to make ano
ther endeavour to express their hatrid oi
Mr. Dundas ; and whether theMagrltiates
were tired of killing, or the soldiers ol
coming, they were allowed to effect their
purpoie without interruption. On which
they very quietly differ fed.
" I bus, Sir, five pedple have Idft their
lives, many their limbs and comfort through
life, to pixvent that, which, after all w..s
not preventedâthe burning of a few rags
itufied with Uraw, under the title of the
representative of Mr. Duudas.

However warmly he wilhfcd for a mo.

he could not withhold from it his zealous

After this, many diflinguifhed cluvac*

Any man is said to be mad who t?ILs

therefore, Mr. Paine undertook to pull
down the despotism of wicked tiatefftien,

With all the noise and nonsense about
prosecuting Mr. P.iine we hear nothing of
the Attorney-General having received or
ders to prosecute Mr. Burke for a libel on
the coriftitution, or Mr. Rose for corrupt
interference in the Wellminller eledlion.
The blood of every Engliflunan mull
furtly curdle with horror to think that the
punilhment of one thoufanil lajhes with a

low creature. It may be called discipline,
and be deemed necefTary to keep the poor
foldierÃ in a Hate of obedience, but the se
verity of it can neither be excused nor pal

What is the reason that so many of the
Lords and Members of Parliament abuse
Mr. Paine, even though he is under pro

deal of excellence in his work, to excite
such bitter ariimofity. We begin to think
this Paine must be an honelt fellow, and
that he deserves support.

I N so young a country as tills, it is not a
little to be regretted, that even our trading
laws are rendered in very abstruse language,
and frequently incumbered with technical
terms that bewilder the man of plain under-
Handing and education. But, it is to be
presumed, the committees of Congref
who draft them, too frequently follow the
obfeure dittion of the reports of the Secre
tary of the Treasury. in this idea I am
confirmed by an exoreflton of a member of
the H.R.when called upon to explain some
thing in the excise hill. His atifwer was
in words to this effert : " I do not holdmvfelj
refpo fiblc for the explanation of the bill I navt
drawn it up agreeably to the order of the House ; viz,
in conformity with the report of the Secretary of the
Treasury."
Thus, we cannot complain of our Repre
sentatives for involving our commercial
laws in a maze : they all may exculpa.e
themselves by laying the blame on a " Re
presentative officer." It is well known that
the great abilities of our public officers are
held forth by some printers as a fufficienr
exclife for doubling the debt of the United
States, for perpetuating our taxes, and for
involving America in a scene of blood with
the Indians.
It has been argued by some. that it would
be better for America were all the legHla
tive powers vested in responsible officers-, and
thus above three hundred thousand dollars
would have been laved from the pay of
Congress, who spent so much time in de
bateduring the lalt feflions, in making even
the Impost Law. Hut others (of whom
I am one) will fay, that the time was spent,
not in fixing the duties, tonnage, &c. but in
contending againlt some of those dutie
which the real republican members deemed
unconstitutional, although they were left
in the minority.
These thoughts will occur to every mer
chant whom the (hoe pinches, especially i'
he has had none of the emoluments ariiing
from army contrails, or from the purcha:t
ofllate debts at an undervalue. Thofc
who have made a jobb of the bulinefs may
praise and extol it. It is the duty of all
good citizens to warn their brethren of the
increasing danger.

To Mr. CEORGE LATIMER, Chairman
of the Committee of Correspondence.
S i R,
WHILE every mind fecms busy in con
templating the great fubjeft of fede
ral representation, it would seem as if I
were unconcerned in the general weal, un
less I gave an opinion on the nvghty ques
tion. To be sure, weak minds ought not
only to fuficr others of morcitrerigih to think
but to speak for them ; but as the contagion
of the times has seized me, I find myfell
contiraincd, in the firil delirium of its ope
ration, to utter fonietliing, ihould it even be
biloro the level of those appointed to think for
me. A mighty suss and pother has been
made, and is Hill making, about conferred
anil committees of correspondence, as if,
not only our happiness here, but our bliss
hereafter depended upon them. Some in
deed have gone so far as to hint, that patri
ots only llioukl have a preference when ho
nors and loaves and fillies are in diltribn
tion ; but, Sir, this is an idea that never
Ihould enter into the mind of a rational
man; lor as they are already paid for their
Cervices, they ought not to look for any o
ther reward, any more than the labourer
who has allilted in building a house, Ihould
infill upon being a proprietor of it for hL
pains. Has not the convention at Ver
faillcs placed us all upon an equal footing,
and have we not agreed, through our mi.li
fters, to fwallpw large draughts of the wa
ters of Lethe, that our political character
may be renovated, and that the spirit ol re
feniment for pall injuries and attempts upon
our liberties may be drowned ? Surely,
surelyâin addition to this, the change in
our government has mellowed us down into
a common mass of character, where former
distinctions are loft, and where the war
worn foidier, and ghost-like counsellor. lie
in one undiftinguithed heap, amid Britons
and their friends. The fumes of revolu
tion-powder did not, to be sure, obtund my
olfactory much, nor throw a veil across my
optics; neither have the fears of freedom's
cause given me any great title topre-emi
nence ; I wilhed well to my country, and
my feeble fervites were devoted to her ;
but if I had given up a leg or an arm, my
fortune or my health, my ease or my happi
ness, do these amount to claims of prefer
ence ? No, Sirâa freeman ought to be a
christian, and a christian, on beii'g fmo:e on
one cheek, will certainly hold the other,
and reverence the chastening hand. Tho'
dlltinctions between a friend and an enemy
to his country are manifeltly absurd in times
of profound peace, there are other di&inc
tions which certainly merit attention ; for
I maintain, Sir, that tmdcrjlandin r and property
are in a dir-jft ratio with each other, and that the
man of l'mall fortune is absolutely incapable
of state affairs.for he is liulebetter than a fool.
Vou have wifely attended to this diltinition
m the choice offume of your committee, and
much credit is due to you for the well-judged
felettion. But to come to the point, tor X
am afraid of tirin : you with my fmiplicity,
as I begin to be weary with it myfelf, I abo
minate dlltinctions of every kind, unless, as
I have laid before, they are xhefo'id dlltinc
tions of fortune, or perhaps of family, and

any objections Ihould arise to the ticket, as
being composed of charaÂ£ters reiiding with -

its interejl to pay a proper attention to them ;

the head, And the head is allowed to be the

Itisa lamentable circumstance, Sir, that
the people are seized with the phrenzy oj
thinking for themselves, and will not (nbmit to
a conclave or conference; but you have a
dopted a mode equally effectual to inftruO
them in the duties tiiey owe to yon and to
themselvesâa correspondence, by means of
which you will become a lens, thro' which
the diverging rays of popular opinion and
interests will be brought to a focus. With
out this politico-philosophical mode of ag
gregating things, the people could never be
made to understand their true interests, and
much ought they to thank you for your su

THE gale which did so much damage at
Tea, about the 6th initant, and from which
so many vclfels have more or less fullered,
feenis, from the particulars yet collected,
to have raged between the latitudes of 17
and 36, and from long. 63 to 71, 72, and
73,(h0w much farther ealtward is not afcer
laiued). It is remarkable that vellcls that
left Charlcfton bar 011 the very fame day on
which this deflructive tornado happened,
had the 1110 ft delightful weather, wind from
S. 10 S.S.K. a clear, (crene Iky, tho' some
what 0/ a heavy swell 011 the bar,undoubted
ly owing to the gale to the ealtward. It is
evident from the accounts received, that
the violent norih-welt.wind which fucceded
the gale, and blew a hurricane, mult h^ve
originated a confide: able diflance ft cm l!:o
land, as none of our coasters have experi
enced any thingfevere from that quarter.
By the last arrivals from Europe, we
learn that several camps are forming in
England and Ireland ;â their objeftis (it is
raid) to prevent any attempts at national
revolution or reformation.
Mr. Paine has addrefled a long letter to
Mr. Secretary Dundas, oil account of the
latter, at the opening the debate in the
House of Commons, having (tiled Paine's
Rights of Man " a vVicked and seditious pub
lication " In this letter Mr. Paine supports
the principles of his work, with h ! s ufnal
ability, against the aspersions and mifrepre- ,
fentations of a man who is rolling in luxury
at the expence of the nation, and who, as
far as he could, has denied his native coun
try,Scotland,the right of equal representation;
but for which (fays an English paper) he
hiuifelf has been reprcfented in every town in
Scotland by way ofeiligy on the gallows.
Not with (tan ding all that has been said of
offenfive war, between France, Auftria,&c.
it begins to be fufpefted that a defen
live fyftein will be embraced by both par
ties. Tile real object of'AuftriafoemmCcarcely
more than preventing a revolt of her Flan
drian provinces. Prufiia is againlt the in
terference of Russia in dictating a constitu
tion to Poland, which will probably prevent
any very considerable junction of the allied
forces from that quarter, to ast against
Fiance.

"T lit Marquis de la Fayette is indefati
gable in efh'blifhing discipline in the army,
and forming it in such a manner as to prove
an etfeftive barrier against any projected in
roads of the Aultria.is or their allies. These
incefl'ant cares, however, are beginning to
work a vifiblc eft'eft upon a constitution na
turally (trong, and a spirit replete wlthen
thuliafmfor the welfare and final establish
ment of the rights of mankind. M. de la
Fayette eats little, and carries an example
of temperance almolt to extravagance; a
little bread and water, with now and then
a glass of light wine, afford the principal
means of his fnbfiftence. Sleepless nights
and toilsome days are the lot ot this active
friend of mankind ; and liiltory will mark
hm out as one of those few extraordinary
men, who are born for the human race, and
not for themselves. âIt is thought there
will be an attack upon some of the enemy's
posts in a (hort rme. Their army is ga
thering strength, but upon a serious view of
the matter, and the divfions like to take
place on account of Poland, it is thought
their op-rations will merely tend to pevent
a revolt in the Austrian Low Countries."
On the <;th instant arrived at Norfolk,
Virginia, in diltrefs, a brig that had been
bound from New Orleans to Cape-Francois,
but w a-; overiet by a violent gult in lat. 21,
which obliged the crew to cut away both
mails. On ofjuly they (poke the
fliip , Captain White, from England
bound to Charleston, who supplied them
with two finall spars, for which he demand
ed and received thirty-fix dollars. Fiftee i
leagues to theS.E. of Cape Henry, they
fell in with brig Polly, of Bedford, (C.on
nefticut) Hugh Fish, mailer, from a fuc
cel' ful whaling voyage, who conducted the
brig into Hampton Road, for the moderate
sum of 2iodollars.
It is said a French squadron has been spoke

Boston. If so. it may be concluded that
peace is as good as rcltored in the French

" A number of young farmers [fays a cor
refponderitj who are abont to fettle some

point that immediately concerns them ; and
on which, before their removal, they
would be glad to take the opinions of their

- will persevere in the system of Briti'fh
politics, and will, after the policy of that
nation, extend the F.xcife to Cider, Beer,
Candles, and other neceiTary articles in a
family ? âThis question mi; ht, perhaps,
with propriety have been addrefled to those
who have secretly influenced the meafurcs
of Congress, and who are now exerting
every nerve to fill the new lesfiflature with
men devoted to avarice, and who will hum
bly pnrfue every measure dictated by their
patrons."

A (liort, tlio' curions eflay, appears in a

this author' opinions.âDon Quevedo will
convince uhe is wrong :â" In hell (fays
Don Quevedo) I saw no barbers.âThe de

A few years perhaps will bring to light
the real grounds for the present war carri

several particulars have leaked out, which
ieem to lligmatize it as unjufliliable and

count, one third of the Engli.'h company',
territory in Indoitan is now reduced to a

House of Commons a war of ambition, at

avoided : lire, devaluation, and plunder had
been carried into almost every quarter, and
it was held impossible to give any probable
computation of the number of unfortunate
people who have already perilhed by the
war and its COnsequences : it was though
however, that it would exceed a million ol
fouls. From a review of the Bengal news
papers, the affairs of that country seem ra

meilts continually appear in those papers, of
tiie sale of lands for want of due payment
of the revenue. On December 27, 179'.

At a Meeting of the Germantown Societ/
for promoting domestic manufactures, on
Monday last, the following address wai
delivered by the Prrjidcnt.
Gentlemen,
DID not yonrfteady attention and exer
tions to promote American manufacturer
afford a pleafmg afliirance of your determi
necl reiolutiort to support thein ; I flioitld
not at this time call your attention to the
schemes of some influential characters in the
United States, which if carried into full ef
fect, will tend to destroy the infant manu
factures of our country. You are all ac
quainted with the proposition ol the Secre
tary of the Treasury to establish national
manufactories, and that at this moment he
;; pursuing his plan wirh. unremitted atten
tion. Should he be fuccefsful in this pro
ject, to what situation will you be reduced,
who are personally engaged in manufac
tures ? Will not the exemption from mili
tia duty, and the exclusive privilegesgranted
to the workmen of such factories, draw off
yo\ir hands ? Will not the prodigious capi
tals of monied men invelled in such eftab
liflnnents, enable them to monopolize all
the raw materials, particularly in the im
portant occupations of the hatter and tan
ner ? Will not the exclusive privilege
granted to the corporation of establishing
lotteries to indemnify them for lofl'js, ena
ble the company to undersell and ruin every
private citizen personally engaged in manu
facture's? Will not the arbitrary and un
uftifiable interference of government in the
private occupations of citizens discourage
young men from acquiring the knowledge
any occupation in which they may be ru
ned by a combination of rich men enjoying_
:he particular patronage and protection ot
jovernment.
This subjeCt and these qucftions me
it your serious attention. As yet you have
lie power in your own hands, you ought to
;xert it to support your rights.
It is the slavish do&rine of some men," that
rovernment has the whole property of citi
zens under 1 its command, and that every
aw enaCted by the legislature ought to be
jbeyed." No government on earth can be
nvefted with power to violate those natural
â¢ights of man, the protection of which, is
:he sole objeCt of the inititution of civil fo
:iety , therefore, every attempt made by
i legislature to destroy them, ought to be
jppofed by a free people.
The ambitio* and avarice of fo;r.e men
jre never to be fatisfied. A few such cha
. aCters have been for some time bending the
ivhole power of the United States lo pro
note their own private views of ambition
ind wealth. Not content with the honor
ible name of citizen, they with to introduce
liftinCtion of rank ; ntit content with en
joying at their ease every advantage which
aur country can afford, or their wealth pro
cure, they desire to interfere in the occu
pations, and to curtail the enjoyments of
their fellow-citizens. They act as if they
wilhed to bring the whole wealth and pow
er of the country under their feet. May
the early eppofition of the People ofA
mericato the unjust llieafures of these delu
ded menâmay the glorious and bleiled
light of the French revolution, aided by the
writings of the friendly clubs in England,
tend to convince them of their errors, and
bring them to regard the rights of men in
every occupation, as sacred.

THREE dauglueis i have, and as prettily
made,
AÂ» haridfome as any you'll fee,
And lovers the-y count, but.still I'm afraid
They always wild hur.g upon me.
In writing of letters and talking of love
They 2re foolifnly spending their time ,
One fends them a ribbon, and one the new
gloveâ
And thus they are palling â¢heir prime.
With idle Romances my book-cafe is ftor'd
Tnat teach them to praise nor to pray ;
And the Bible itfe-lf is difcharg'd frGm the board
"Where once with John B+nyan it lay.
Thefefuitors znd lovers, that never can love,
{Content w.ith a squeeze of the hand]
Though often the fubjeÂ£t of Hvmen I move,
The lubject ihey can't understand.
These bucks of the town, with their elegant coats 3
I'm sick of their horles and chairs ;
They plunder my hay, and they pilfer my oats-
Am 1 keeping a tavern my dears.
This courting and courting and aever concluding
Is nonfenfeâl'ara sorry to fayâ
Your killing and playing is rather intruding
Vnlefsâyou will take them away.

Declaration of the Kings of and
Hungary, delivered to all the minijlers at
the Diet oj Ratijbon, excepting those of
Saxony and Hanover, Publijhed at Ra
tijbon, May 7, 1792.
" In conlcquence of the aflociation
made between all the princes, on the in
vitation cf the deeeafed Empcvor for th<?
defence and fafety of the empire, the kings
of Pit!ilia and of Hungary conjointly,
hope that none of the slates of she empire
will withdraw themfelv.es therefrom ; but,
on the contrary will hasten tÂ» contribute,
by every means, in their power, to sup
port the war againlt Francs', who threat
ens the empire. Their raajelties demand,
that the aforef.iid States, without entering
into any difcufiion on the queltion, whe
ther the war is againlt the empire or a.
gainlt the houle of Austria, will explain
themselves categorically on the luccours
they ate willing to supply. and on which
however they ate leit to their free will,
flatte ing themlelves, however, that the
supplies will be proportioned to the gran
deur of the reipeftive States. These fiw
cours may be iii troops, or in provi
liou3, or 111 full liberty to the beii.gercnt
armies to vecruit in the said State., If,
cont.ary to all expectation, there fhoukl
be any Hate, who, by any reason whatever,
renounces itie affociatioo, their said majes
ties will be forced purely and funply to cov
er their own States, as also thole of their
allies, and to abandon the others to their
fate. They will even adopt the principle
<â¢ he that is not for us is againlt us," and
will put it in ex-cution as circumltances
may require ; but their majesties have so
high an opinion of the patiiotifm of all the
States of the empire,that they allure them
selves beforehand of receiving from each a
speedy and fatisfadtory anlwer."
Tbis declaration after being made ver
bally was delivered in writing to all tht
ministers at the Diet, except those of Sax
ony and Hanover. It wae received with
genera! The imperious
tone afiumedby the kings of Hungary &
Pruffin, and their menacing the co-eitaten,
were loudly complained of. " If Fr&nci(
lit." it was said, " already takes upor
qim to command us, what will he dc
when elected emperor " I told you,'
said the minilter of Saxony, " that in this
young pr nee we Giould lind a mailer.
ExtraS of a Utter from the van-guard of tht
army of La Fayette, dated June 11 th.
" The brave Gouvion has fallen in hi)
country's caul'e. If any thing can add to
our grief it is to think that he 101 l lift
in a skirmish. We did not lose 30 men,
This morning our van-guard was at
tacked at Grifelle, beyond Maubeuge, by
a large body of the Aultrian army. They
expected to surprise us, but did not suc
ceed.
The General had Rationed polls tc
communicate by signals. Maubeuge wa;
the intermediate Itation. Unfortunately
the weather was so unfavorable, that the
firing of cannon was not heard at the dis
tance of three quarteraof a league by those
diredted to attend to and repeat the sig
nals.
A.B soon as M. La Fayette had learnt
that his van-guard was attacked, he went
forward l.imfclf cn a gallop, and made his
trcops advance In two columns to attack
the enemy. There was a very hot firings
especially from our fide, as our light field
pieces, confiding of eight pounders, and
some pieces of a larger bore, produced
great effe& on the columns of the enemy.
The lieutenant Colonels of the volun
teeersof Cote d ? or were killed. M. Gou
vicn, uneasy concerning an ammunitior
waggon which did not return, went for
ward with an huflar towards a house
which appeared out of the enemy's reach :
and there, by the nroft fatal accident, he
was struck by a rebounding bullet and kil
ted on the spot.
Our troops were retiring towards Mau
beuge, when M. de La Fayette eame up
He made them advance towards a hedg<
that had beeu deferred. The corps d<
reserve then came np,&; soon after, by ano
ther*oute, a column of infantry and ca
fairy.
M, La Fayette retook all the ground
loft and the enemy retired. We followec
them upwards of a league beyond th(
ground occupied by our van guard. Everj
ilation was retaken, and our army wai
displayed on a height to offer battle ; bill
it appears that their intention was to -fur
piifeand to cut u?> our van-guard. No 1
having succeeded, they retired, efpeeiall)
when they perceivcd that we were read)
to attack them on two fides*
Part of their dead were carried off, th<
remainder were left behind with foraj
wonnded and some priioners I mvfell
counted 11 Houlans and Austrian grena
diers dead in a road, one of whom was at
officer. The fccond regiment of huffari
cut to pieces forty Houlans who weri
surrounded by two fquadroos.
We have in hospital 25 wounded> o
which 10 are Auftiians.
Such is the exadl account of this en
gagement, which would be advantageous
at we drove back the enemy, if we had no!
had the misfortune of loofmg a man whofi
memory will ever be dear to us.
