Tranjlatior. of an Original Slate Paper recently
reamedfrom Cape Francois. J
of tile National Civil Deputies to the
Persons assembled at Crax-des-Bouquets. *
Cape Francois, Dec. at. 179 1.
WE returned an answer to the letter
-vhich was handed to us by M. M. Malef
:ot and Ruette : it is dated the Bth inft.
ind is written in the name of the members
if the military administrative council, and
he deputies from the several parishes of
iie western department, assembled" at
-roix-des-Bou ,uets. We replied, in like
iianner, to the paper received by the post,
entitled, " the address of the people of
:olour of the western department," dated
:he fame day and at the fame place. âThese
lieces contain ift. a brief account ofthe vari
ous disastrous events which have taken place
trom the commencement of the revolution
to the date of your letter. 2d. The de
mand of ccrtain political rights in favour
of the mulattoes, founded on the declara
tion of the rights of man and citizenihip, as
well as upon the edicts of March 8. and
Ottober 12, 1790, and May 15, and Sept.
24, 1791. 3d. Your for conclud
ing your pretended treaty of peace of the
2311. of October lift, which you hold up to
us as the only means of saving the colony ;
and which opinion you fuppoi t by repre
senting to 11s the tranquil state of the west
ern and southern diftrifts, while the north
ern is convulsed by a general infurreftion.
And lastly, these dispatches express the de
lire you entertain of feeing us with you at
Croix-des-Bouquets.
We Jhould be unworthy of the character
with which we are iuvefted, if we did not,
in the firtt place, acknowledge our refpeft
for thole principles, which " permit you
not to doubt, that the prosperity of the co
lony is inseparable from the individual hap
piness of those who compose it." We do
not doubt that these principles, cultivated
under legal forms, and in the calm of peace,
might in the end induce the white people
at St. Domingo to grant to the mulattoes
all that could be reasonably expected ; and
to convince the latter that it is not less
their interest, than it becomes them on
principles of gratitude, to yield, in their
turn, to the whites of the colony, the pri
vileges they ought to enjoy.
Wefhouldbe fearful of offending you,
it we entertained theleaft doubt of the pu
rity of your motives. But we should be
:ray your confidence in us, in concealing
From you how very culpable we hold you,
n relisting the voice of reason. Listen to
as, then, with sincerity, divert yourselves
as all partiality, forget your own personal
injuries, and by your obedience to the
Law, put us in a situation to join our medi-
Ition to yours, in procuring for the mulat
toes the immunities which, in justice, they
aught to poilefs.
We will now take into consideration the
:ontents of the letter and address. Firstâ
The title afi'umed by the signers of the let
ter can only exist in a state of disorder aud
inarchy, and which you cannot avail your
lelves of much longer unless you avow
yourselves to be in open rebellion. Indeed,
is it poflible that there can legally exist an
irmy of lourteen confederated parishes, to
compel the reft to submit to them ? Altho'
this army were conflitutionally appointed,
could it deliberate upon and form refolu
t 011s ? Could its administrative council be
employed otherwise than in the interior re
gulations of the army ? would it be not on
ly independent of the king':, representative,
â¢Sfr Persons [supposed to be chiefly retainers to the
irijlocrataalfattion in Francej who had incorpo
rated themselves with an army of Mulattoes to de
mand the repeal of the aÂ£l of the National AJfem
bly disallowing the Mulattoes of St. Domingo
â¢.qualprivileges with the whites of that colony.hut even dictate orders to hi in ? would they
mate an ill use of theirJtrength at the pre
sent moment in demanding that [belides the
formation of primary ever}
coniututional principle should be violated
in hefe atiemblies, either by overt .ruing
the fyltem of colonial laws for freemen, to
in.t.tute new ones ; or by revoking irrevo
cable deputations, and annihilating the acl-
Uiimitrative bodies ?âSuch, however, will
be the ruinous consequences of your con
federation, notwitliftanding the purity 01
your principles. They are the
of the nation and of the king, who now ad
dref you, and would be sorry you did not
repose in them the confidence that is due.
Secoud.y, We (hall not spend time in re
cap tulating facts which have taken place
in tins lfland since the revolution. Let us
baauh forever from our remembrance tlic
fuipictons, feuds, vengeance, proi'criptions,
murders, conflagrations and enormities ol
every species. In a national convulsion,
like ours, who can reiift a torrent, and
liow small is the number of irreproachable
characters in comparison of thofg who have
been active in evil, and frequently l"o upon
a misunderstanding of thingsâmull ail be
puniined indiscriminately ; the mis-led
equally with the wicked and designing ? â
and are these diilinguuhable 111 the general
coiifu ion of events, appearances, public
rumour , and prejudices of parties ? let
us refpett tne citizen who has never loft
ii"ht of the moral andpolitical duties ; but
let u once more reciprocally pardon each
otiier for tnofe injurious proceed,ngs which
it was not in our power to prevent, any
more than if we had both been under the
dcl.num of a fever. Let us imitate the
IsaLKm.il, Atfembly and the king. He has
immortalized the era of his reign in accept
ing the constitution, and iiguiug an ad of
general amnpftv.

PHILADELPHIA.
February 23, 1792.
Three candidates 'fays a New-York paper of
the 15th inft.) are held forth tor the honorary
and lucrative office of Governor, viz. his excel
lency George Clint fn, Esq. the Hon. John Jay ;
and the Hon. Aaron Burr.
The bill for incorporating a hank (fays the
fame paper) will in a day or two engage the at
tention of our legiflatire. The expediency ot
this measure w 11 appear fiom the following
confideraiions : â10. The infufficiency of the
capital ot the prelVnt bankâ2d. The dangers
attending a monopoly of this hufinefs, and, 3d.
The neceifiiy of some establishment which may
check the increasing influence of the general
government, and its ricioachments upon that ol
the Oate.âThe capital ot the New-York bank
consists of 950,000 dollars : Â©n this capital there
was divined, tor the lufl halt year, seven pei
cent, and a much larger one is contemplated
for (he next. Allowing, then, for expences and
the undivided fuiplus of the last half year, the
bank will, this yeai, make at lead 21 per cent.
Di(counts mufl of course, have been made tc
an am unt three times exceeding tha f of their
capital ; and yet it is well known that many
and good notes have been uniformly refufed,
and their inability alledged as the sole reason for
fucft rejeÂ£lions.

the Dumfries Gazette, of the l6th inft. as ai:
extratf of a letter from an officer who fervtd
in the expedition.]
" ON the morning of the 4th of November,
just as the men had been difmifled from parade,
a rapid attack was made upon our advance,
which was eompofed of militia, and had the
evening before been thrown over a fniall rivei
which ran along our front; they ran into camp it:
the most confufed manner, without making any
attempt to check the enemy. By the dilorderly
retreat of these cowaidly rascals, our hrll lint
was thrown into confution ; but the aiertnels ol
the officers soon remedied this daugerous event,
bv forming the men again in pioper order,
which were m iingle file, each man four feri
apart. The Indians ascended theb,mkÂ»in our
fiont almost at the fame time with the militia,
but were checked by til? fi>e of the artillery and
Capt- Brocks'camp guard, which were polled
on thebank of the creek infiont of the centre ol
our camp. At this time fell the brave Col.
Oldham in attempting to rally the broken mili
tia. They theneiivided and ran in multitude:
round cur flanks thiough the woods, and in lomt
jr.eafute exposed to the fire of our from line a;
they passed along it. In a few minutes â¢::: were
completely luriounded, and the lite beeanie hoi
and general upon all quarters, but particularly
where the ai tillery was polled, which you will
fee by the draft I inclose. A charge with bayo
nets took place by the fid regiment, Gatiher's
battalion nd the left picket, which had by this
time got in and formed 011 the lefiot the fid re
giment, led 011 by Col. Dai ke in the moll gailani
manner. Such of the enemy as were opposed
to this line, fled at the approach of the bayonet,
and by fcatteiing presented no object to our
roeu; it would then become necelfary to return
to our camp and to adill the fiifl line which
were still warmly'engaged and out-flanked by the
enemy, whose fire, from under cover, was al
ways certain, and generally definitive. The
Indians followed us in turn, killing and wound
ing many of us. Another chaige was made by
the front line, but with as little effect as the
fiifl ; in thischargea pai ty of the enemyentered
by the flanks and scalped a number of our of
ficers and privat; s who lay wounded inthe tents.
They had polLfTion of our cannon, but a smart
charge by a party with bayonets difpolftlfed
them and drove them from the camp. AH the
artilieiy officers, excepting Lieut. Spear, with
mod of the matrofles were either killed 01
wounded, and the artillery ot couife fileticcd
Lieuts. Spear, Sedam andSel.umberg, of the sits
regiment, and another o&icer of he Vn ;ini;
levies, got together a few men, and let the ar
tillery again a roaring; but not being able, wit!
everv exertion in their power, to colle't as ma
ny men together as would work the pieces, am
Lieut. Spear being killed, they were again to
tally silenced, the Indians charging up to
very mouths with their tomahawks. The battl
had now raged for three hours with greet (laugh
ter on our lide, and Gen. Butler and the prea;
eft part of the officers, with fix hundred men la;
dead or. the field, and near four hundred wound
ed. It then -became necciTary to think of a re
treat, the men were all in a conFused huddle ii
one (lank of the encampment, and paid no kin<
of attention to the repeated orders oi " chargi
the load." Capt. Henry Catbeny, of the Ma
ryland battalion, with great prefencc of nnnd
mentioned, annex the words "go home" t(
charge the road, and I will engage for itshavirr
the desired effefl. Col. Darke, who had tnadt
several attempts to lead them on, m one of wind
he was wounded in the thigh, ctied out, 'â¢ Le
us, my brave fellow , charge the road and g<
home." They infiamly, with fixed bayonets
and trailed arms, broke through the Indian
like a torrent, who were very numerous in thi
quarter, foi the purpose, I suppose, ofcutting u
off from the road. We gained it, however
with le!.; difficulty and lols than I expeQed.â
The enemy followed us lour miles and then re
turned to our camp, the plunder of which en
grossed, I (uppole, their attention, and favei
the (cottered remains of our aimy. The chie
part of their fury on the retreat fell upon thi
poor women and children, who could no; k^n]
pace with the fugitives. Near fifty fell a facri
lrce to the savages. A little after fun-letting wi

having been so dilatory in accepting the he

Dec. 2. âAmong the various impediments
to the complete ai,d general adoption of the
new comtitution, not the lealt seems to be
the re-uniting of Avignon and the Comta,
I 'maijlin to the dominiolls of Franee. I f the
decrees of the aHembly relative to the Ger
man poflellions in Alsace and Lorraine,
have no: already efieited that purpose, it is
certain that the violent revullion of these
two territorie from the popilh demesne:
will conliderabiy increase the prejudice;
that already operate among the Furopear
powers againlt the French revolution.
I he pope has addrtfied all the powers o;
nu. ope on the injiiftice of this decree o:
the allembly . in which he accuses them oi
tnconkftency and injustice, and allests his
claim in the Itile of an helpiefs old man who
cannot revenge his own wrongs, and there
fore humbly implores the assistance ol
others.
The address is in fubfiance as follows :
" By their decree of the 14th of Septem
ber lalt, the national aflembly in pretend
ing to incorporate the city of Avignon and
the Con, at- V enaillin with the French mo
narchy, evidently betray a determination to
difpoli'els the hoiy father of property of
which he is the lawful and only mafier.
i he decree above referred to is no less un
juii than lalfe, is evidently designed to im
poie upon the world, and directly contra
dicts the allertions of those perfidious mo
vers oi who, after the moll solemn
proteii ations, that they Jot ever renounced ai
ideas of con t utjl, have impudently dared to
authorize a mod criminal and arbitrary
uiurpation of foreign territory.
" In the Ihort space of eighteen month
they have four times attempted, under va
rjoiis pretexts, to incorporate with France,
these two provinces, rightfully appertaining
to the holy Tee. At o-ne time they tried to
invalidate the pope's title; at another time
they brougl't forward Tome pretended com
plaints of the inhabitants, as if they wished
to become Frei'chmen.âAgain, they de
bated whether these provinces might not
be demanded ds iiiti ral parts of France ;
and they were not ashamed on afl these
occasions to have recotirfe to the meanelt
fophidry and impodure to support designs,
all tending to the completion of this aban
doned projeft â'" Notw ithdandingthe imi
verfal uneaiinefsdccafioned by these insidiouS
deps, and notwithdunding the wicked ac
tivity of a party, spurred on by hatred ma
lignity, and premeditated spite againd the
holy fee, the evidence of truth prevailed :
this daring attempt became universally odi
ous âthe indignation of the public was ex
cited, and at lad judice triumphed. On the
24th of May, a decree was ptiblifhed which
disavowed every intention of the incorpo
ration above mentioned.
" AH the plans of the cabal for seizing
the sovereignty of these didrifts from the
pope were fruftrated by thi decree ; ar.d
his holiness began to entertain hopes that
there would be no further occasion of com
plaint on this head â The decree, however
of Sept. 14. has again baffled all his hopes'
and he cannot possibly reconcile this renew
al of the claim on the part of France, with
the former proteliations of the alTembly,
which disavowed a'l claim to the territo
ries in quedion. âIt is with adonifl merit
his holiness observes, that the pretended
right of France to these territorie â  i- found
ed on a pretense of the free tuifh of the citizens
to be incorporated, as a fart of that kn:gdm.
" The date >f these claims i "as recent
as thev are unfounded. Difcuflions on this
fubjeel were nt d held in r 89, a id although
the claim Of I' ranee was supported in the
assembly by every argument that the mod

House of ftipÃisEnTATivts.
Friday, Feb. 3.
Delates on the Fificry Billâon the motion to Jlrikt
out the JirJi session.
(Concluded.)
Mr. Ame9 observed, that one essential defeÂ£t,
in the former law refpe&ing the drawback of thi
duty on fait, is the delay---the duty being pair
Letore the filherman goes out on his fiuiinj
voyage, and the drawback not being payable un
til fix months after the exportation of the filh
a circumstance which proves a heavy difaavan
tage to men of small capitals; that, of. the mo
Hey, which is drawn from the trealury to pfa;
those drawbacks, one part is an a&ual loss to go
vernmeht, whilst another part never reaches thi
iilhermen at ail ; that it is very doubtful, wile
ther the filherman receives a higher price for hi:
ififh, in conlideration of the drawback, than h
would if no such allowance were made 5 that
even though, in process of time, this might b<
the cafe, yet if the benefit be not loon felt, i
will in the end prove ineffectual, as the filhermei
will in the mean time fink under the unequa
competition with foreigners ; that the annua
product of the fiiheries, previous to the late war
was a million of dollars ; and that, if
rations be now fuffered to supplant us in this bu
finefs, which is an inexhaustible mine of nation
al wealth, we lose not only the income, but air
the capital itfelfj the filhing towns being bu i 1
1 naked rocks and barren sands, which, tliougl
now, by the hand of industry, cdorned with hou
l'es, and stores, and wharves, and docks, &c
must soon fee all these improvements go to ruii
and decay, unless supported by the filh in g trade
as the ordinary course of commerce is not lufÃci
ent to support them : that it w'.uld be foolifh ii
the extreme to cast away the advantages whici
Nature herfelf has put into our hands ; that no
thing more is alked for the fifnermen, than bare
ly to receive back their own property with whicl
they have entrusted the government, and to h
placed on the fame footing with every other per
son in the United States, whore-exports import
ed commodities ; that it is the duty of govern
ment to support and protect her citizens in what
ever quarter the danger threatensâ-it on the fron
tier, to fend armies-âif on sea, to lend fleets so
their defence ; that in theprefent cafe, the fi/h
ery may be supported without any expence to go
vernment ; that the lailors employed in thi:
branch, being Heeled with toil and hardlhip, na
turalized to the boisterous element, and hardy as
the very bears that stalk around them on tlx
floating fields of ice, whilst anchored off the bank
of Newfoundland are much more ufeful tc
their country in time of war, than any other clafi
of fearnen 5 for, being entirely out of bulinefs aÂ«
soon as a war is commenced â finding no Ihelte:
on the filhing banksâhaving no property to lose
and hoping to enrich themselves at the expenc<
of our adversaries, they annoy the enemy, withou:
being themselves exposed to annoyance ; that, ir
cafe of a maritime war, the sailors employed ir
the fiiheries, could readily man a hundred fail 01
privateers, that would sweep the ocean, and fpreac
devaluation and dismay among our enemies. The
prodigious number of Britiih prizes, taken by
those adventurers during the late war, afford fuf
ficient proofs of what they are capable of doing
in the service of their country : As an instance
of their spirited exertions, he mentioned the suc
cess of one of their privateers, of only 16 guns and
150 men, that captured, in a single cruise, twenty
of the enemy's veflels, with 100 guns, and 40c
men -and observed, that even to this day, the
Britiih merchants feel the ruinous effedtsof that
kind of predatory war.
Mr. Ames now entered into a calculation,
tending to Ihew, from the quantity of filh ex
ported, the quantity of fait expended on that filh,
sndthe amount of the drawbacks allowed on the
exportation, that the government loses considera
bly on the one hand, and the filhermen still
more on the other.
After a variety of other remarks, he concluded
by observing, that the filhery, however important
to the ftace of Mafl'achufetts, is equally so to
every other state in the union j that it is not the
interest of particular Hates, but the national inter
est that is at stake j that in our competition with
foreign nations, we are fighting them with such
superior arms and with such superior strength as
rnuft finally ensure us a due reward for all our
struggles.
Mr. Madison. In the conflict I feel between
my disposition, on one hand, to afford every con
stitutional encouragement to the fiiheries, and
my dislike, on the other, of the coniequences ap
prehended from foms clauses in the bill, I lhould
have forborne to enter into this difcullion, if 1
had not found, that, over and above such argu
ments as appear to be natural and pertinent to
the fubjedt, others have been introduced, which
aie, in my judgment, contrary to the true mean
ing, and even strike at the charadteriftic princi
ples of the exiftingconftitution. Let me premise,
however, to the remarks which I (hall briefly of-
Jer, on the do&rine maintained by these gentle
men, that I make a material diftin&ion in the
present. cafe, between an allowance as a mere
commutation and modification of a drawback,
and an allowance in the nature of a real and po
sitive bounty. I make a diftin&ion also, as a
fubjeft of fair consideration at least, between a
bounty granted under the particular terms in the
constitution, " a power to regulate trade," and
one granted under the indefinite terms which
have been cited as authority on this occasion.
I think, however, that the term ' bounty' is in
every point of view improper as it is here applied,
not only because it may be offensive to some, and,
in the opinion of others, carries a dangerous im
plication, but also because it does not express the
true intention of the bill as avowed and advoca
ted by its patrons themselves. For if, in the al
lowance, nothing more is proposed, than a mere
reimbursement of a sum advanced, it is only pay
ing a debt ; and when we pay a debt, we ought
not to claim the merit of granting a bounty.
it is supposed tiy f ,me gentleman, that Con
gress have authority not only to grant bounties
in the sense here used, merely as a commutation
for drawbacks, but even to grant them under a
power by virtue of which they may do any thing
which they may think, conducive to the * general
welfare.* This, fir, in rriy mind, raises the im
portant and fundamental question, whether the
general terms which have been cited, are to be
considered as a fort of caption or general descrip
tion of the fpecified powers, and as having no
further meaning, and giving no further power,
than what is found in that fpecification, or as au
ab(tract and indefinite delegation of power ex
lending to all cases whatever ; to all such at
east as will admit the application of money,
which is giving as much latitude as any govern
ment could well desire.
I,.fir, have always conceived --I Believe those
vho proposed the constitution conceived- -it is
till more fully known, and more material to ob
erve, that thole who ratified the constitution con
reived, that this is not an indefinite government,
jeriving its powers from the general terms prefix
ed to the fpecified powers j but a limited govern
ment tied down to the fpecified powers, which
:xplain and define the general terms.
The gentlemen who contend tor a contrary
jodtrine, are surely not aware of the conferences
vhich flow from it, and which they must either
admit, or give up their dodtrine.
it will follow, in the firft place, that if the
terms be taken in the broad fenle rhey maintain,
the particular powers, afterwards so carefully and
distinctly enumerated, would be without meaning,
and must go for nothing. It would be absurd to
"ay, fir ft, that Congress may do what they please ;
and then, that they may do this or that particular
;hing. After giving Cong re fs power to raise mo
ney and apply it to all purposes which they may
pronounce neceflary to the general welfare, it
vould be absurd, to fay the lead, to fuperadd a
sower to raise armies, to provide fleets, &c. In
fadt, the meaning of the general terms in question
must either be fought in the subsequent enumera
tion which limits and details them, or they con
vert the government from one limited as hitherto
supposed, to the enumerated powers, into a go
vernment without any limits at all.
It id to be recolledted, that the terms " com
mon defence and general welfare," as here uied,
ire not novel terms firft introduced into this con-
Vitution. They are terms familiar in their con
trudtion, and well known to the people of Ame
â ica. They are repeatedly found in the old ar
;iclei of confederation, where, although they are
"ufceptibie of as great latitude as can be given
hem by the context here, it was never fuppoled
>r pretended that they conveyed any such power
is is now afiigned to them. On the contrary, it
vas always considered as clear and certain, that
he old Congress was limited to the enumerated
)Owers j and that the enumeration limited and
:xplained the general terms. I afkthe gentlemen
hemfelves, whether it was ever supposed or fuf
)edted, th|t the old Congress could give away the
money of the states in bounties to encouiage agri
'.ulture, or for any other purpose they pleaied. If
"uch a power had been pofTefied by that body, it
vould have been much leJs impotent, or h,Â»ve
>orne a very different charadier from that univer
"ally ascribed to it.
The novel idea now annexed to those terms,
ind never before entertained by the mends or
memies of the government, will have a f'urthei
:onfequence which cannot have been tak<tn into
he view of the gentlemen. Their conftrudtion
vould not only give Congress the complete legi/la
:ive power I have stated $ it would do more $ it
vould supersede all the reftridtions understood at
>resent to lie on their power with refpedt to a ju
liciarv. It would put it in the power of Con
gress to establish courts throughout the United
states, with cognizance of suits between citizen
and citizen, and in all cases whatsoever. This,
fir, seems to be demonstrable : For if the cLufe
in question really authorises Congress to do what
ever they think fit, provided it be for the genera
welfare, of which they are to judge, and money
can be applied to it, Congress must have powei
to create and support a judiciary eftabliihmentj
with a jurifdidtion extending to all cases, favora
ble, in their opinion, to the general welfare, in
the fame manner as they have power to pasÂ«
laws and apply money providing in any other waj
for the general welfare. I lhall be reminded,
perhaps, that, according to the terms of the con
stitution, the judicial power is to extend to cer
tain cases only, not to all cases. But this cir
cumstance can have no effedt in the argument, il
being presupposed by the gentlemen, that the Ipe
cification of certain objedts does not limit the im
port of the general terms. Taking these tcrnn
as an abftradt and indefinite grant of power, they
comprise all the objedts of legislative regulation,
as well such as fall under the judiciary article in
the constitution, as those falling immediately 'un
der the legislative article ; and if the partial enu
meration of ofejedls in the legislative article does
not, as these gentlemen contend, limit the gene
ral power, neither will it be limited by the partial
enumeration of objedts in the judiciary article.
There are consequences, fir, still more exten
sive which, as they follow clearly from the doc
trine combated, must either be admitted, or the
dodtrine must be given up. If Congress can ap
ply money indefinitely to the general welfare, and
are the sole and supreme judges of the general
welfare, they may take the care of religion into
their own hands j fcthey may establish teachers in
every state, county, and parish, and pay them out
of the public treasury j they may take into theii
own hands the education of children, eftabli/hiwg
in like manner schools throughout the union $
they may alTume the provision for the poor ; the)
may undertake the regulation of all roads, other
than post roads : in ihort, every thing, from the
highest objedt of state legislation, down to the
most minute objedt of police, would be thrown
under the power of Congress ; for every objedt 1
have mentioned would admit the application of
money, and might be called, if Congress pJeafed,
provisions for the general welfare.
The language held in various difcufilons of this
House, is a proof that the dodtrine in question
was never entertained by this body. Arguments,
wherever the fubjedt would permit, have constant
y been drawn from the peculiar nature of this go.
vernment as limited to certain enumerated powers,
mflead of extending, like other governments to all
cases not particularly excepted. In a very late
instance, 1 mean the debate on the representation
bill, it mult be remembered that an argumen'
much used, particularly by gentlemen from Mal
fachufetts against the ratio of one for 30,000, was
chat this government was unlike the state govern
ment, which had an indefinite variety of objech
within their power, that it had a imall number 0/
jbjefts only to attend to, and therefore that a
mailer number of representatives would be fuffi
:ient to administer ir.
Arguments have been advanced, to (hew, thai
because, in the regulation of trade, indirect anc
eventual encouragement is given to manuJaliures.
therefore Congress have power to give money ir
lired bounties, or to grant it in any other waj
that would answer the lame purpose. But furelv,
[ir, there is a great and obvious difference, which
it cannot be necefiary to enlarge upon j a dut)
aid on imported implements of husbandry, would
n its operation be an indirect tax on exported pro
luce : but will any one fay that by virtue of 2
Jiere power to lay duties on imports, Congress
night go diredily to the produce or implements ol
igriculture, or to the articles exported ? It is true,
luties on exports are cxprefsly prohibited ; but il
here were no article forbidding them, a power di
ettly to tax exports could never be deduced from
1 power to tax imports, although such a power
night indirectly and incidentally afteft exports.
Jn short, fir, without going further into the
Ã¼bjed, which I should not have here touched on
it all, but for the reasons already mentioned, J
'enture to declare it as my opinion, that were the
>ower of Congress to be eftablilhed in the latitude
:ontended for, it would subvert the very founda
tion, and transmute the very nature of the limited
government eftabliflied by the people of America:
ind what inferences might be drawn or what con
sequences ensue from such a step, it is incumbent
>n us all well to consider.
With refpeft to the aueftion before the House
: or striking out the clause, it is immaterial whe
:her it be struck out, or so amended as to reft on
he avowed principle of a commutation for the
Jrawback, but as a clause has been drawn up by
)ne of my colleagues in order to be substituted.
[ (hall concur in a vote for striking out, reserving
o mvfelf a freedom to be governed in my final
mte by the modification which may prevail.
[Thequeftion was still further debated, and fe
deral other gentlemen rose in opposition and de
"ence. But we will here take leave of thefubjeft,
ind of the fifhery bill altogether our readers
laving been already apprized, that the motion,
: or striking out the fe&ion, was finally negatived,
âthat the word " bounty" was, every where
:hroughout the bill, changed for " allowance"â
and that the bill is patted into a law, having beer
approved and signed by the President of the Uni
:ed States, on the 16th in'Jant.]
Mr. Frenf.AU)
Your republifhing the following, from the In
dependent Gazetter, will oblige one of your sub-
Icribers. A FARMER.
AS long as the States of America continue uni
ted under the present form of government
the people will have to lament the want of i
bill of rights, which would clearly and unequivo
cally dittase to the legislature its duty, aad to th<
people their rights.
It is said that the principle which pervade? th<
constitution of the United States, is, that the fu
preme power resides in the people, and that thi
constitution itfelf opens with a recognition of thi
principleâthat it is a conpaft enteied into b;
freemen, to support and protetl the rights of eacl
other ; and therefore there is no occasion for ade
rlaration of rights to be prefixed to the form o
governmentâthat the people by whom it was or
dained and established, retain all powers not ex
prefsly given up, and that the citizcns of the Uni
red States may always fay, " We reserve the righ
to do what we please."
In a small virtuous commonwealth , where thi
Offices of the government would be esteemed honor
able, but not lucrative, and where every citizei
would not only be eligible to a feat in the legilla
ture, but which, by a ftridl rotation, he would bi
obliged occafionallv, to occupy ; under a pure de
mocracy of this kind, a declaration of the right
of the people might not be abfoluteiy necejfary
But a government of the extent and in the ntua
tion of the United States, being destitute of a clea:
explicit declaration of the rights of the people, thi
honor of serving the state, and of being uleful t<
its citizens, will give place to the most ford it
views of private emolument, and laws which flioult
be made to promote the general welfare, will bÂ»
perverted to serve the ambition and avarice o
the few. AmbafTadorlhips, and places of profii
evil) be created for the ivcll-born. Palaces will bÂ«
:re&ed, and we (hall be told that it is for the ho.
iio'r of government that all its officers and their de
pendants should be supported in a style of oftenta
:ion, parade and luxury, however opprefiive and
injurious to their fellow-citizens. Two parties
will exist, the one enjoying every comfort of life
without labor 5 the other langui(hing in penury,
submitting to every insult and injury. And th<
people, unprote&ed by an explicit declaration oi
their rights, ambitious men will, by artifice and
sophistry, explain away every principle of the go
vernment, in order to render it subservient to theii
own private purposes.
No people ever experienced a more complete de
ftru&ion of their liberties by the encroachments
of government than the French. Few people wit
netted a court of greater pomp, parade and ex
pense. To preserve their country for the future
from such calamities, that wife and enlightened
people thought it necefiary to adopt a declaration
of the rights of man, as the basis on which theii
new constitution was to stand. The declarator)
rxordium which prefaces the declaration, meriti
attention.
Declaration of the Rights of Man and of Citizensâ¢
By the National Afjembly of France,
(t The representatives of the people of France 3
formed into a national afiembly, confidcring thai
â¢;norance, neeleÂ£r or contempt of human rights,
are the fule causes of public misfortunes and cor
ruptions of government, have resolved to set forth,
in a fclemn these natural, imprescrip
tible and unalienable rights : That this declara
tion being constantly present to the minds o*
the members of the body foci aI, they may be ever
kept attentive to their rights and duties $ that the
acts of the legislative and executive powers of go
vernment, being capable of being every momt-nc
compared with the end of political inftitutioOf,
may be more refpedted ; and also that the future
claims of the citizens, being dire&ed by simple
and inconteftible principles, may also tend to the
maintenance of the constitution, and the genera!
happiness : for these reasons the national allembljr
doth recognise and declare, in the presence of the
supreme Being, and with the hope of his blefiing
and favor, the following sacred rights of men and
of citizens :
1. 44 Men are born and always continue free,
and equal in refpeft of their rights. Civil dif
tin&ions, therefore, can be founded only on pub
lic utility*
2. 44 The end of all political aflociations is the
preservation of the natural and imprescriptible
rights of man, and these rights are liberty, pro
perty, security, and refinance of opprefiion.
3. 44 The nation is elfcntially the source of all
fov?reignty, nor can any individual, or any body
of Ufen, be entitled to any authority which is not
expressly derived from it.
4. <4 Political liberty consists in the power of
doing whatever does not injure another. The
sxercife of the natural righls of every man has
no other limits than those which are necefiary to
fecureto every other man, the free exercise of the
fame rights, and these limits are determinable on
ly by the law.
5. 44 The law ought to prohibit only anions
hurtful to society. What is not prohibited by
:he law should not be hindered $ nor should any
one be compelled to that which the law does noc
require."
That highly enlightened people have prefixed
a bill of rights to their form of government, not
as being applicable to their own situation alone,
aut as constituting the foundation of every just
government.
Had the conftltution of the United States a
foundation equally firm and equitable, we fhoufd
dot at this day witness the laws of the Union
Gained with, ift. Mercantile regulations, impo
litic in themselves, and highly injurious to the
agricultural interests of our country.
2. With funding fvftems, by which the proper
ty arid rights of poor but meritorious citizens are
facrificed to wealthy gamesters and speculators.
3. With the establishment of banks, authori
ng a few men to create a fi&itious money, by
jvhich they may acquire rapid fortunes without
industry.
4. With excise laws, which violate the tranqui
lity of domestic retirement, and which prevents
the farmer from enjoying the fruits ot his care
and industry.
However ambitious men may disguise the fun
damental principles of civil society, by the arts of
low cunning and sophistry, vet the social
i.xongft freemen, eftablilhes such an equality,
that every citizen lays himfelf under the fame
obligations, and ought all to enjoy the fame privi
leges. Thus from the very nature of this com
pact, every aÂ£t of the government {hould be equal
ly favorable to all the citizens without diftinc
t'lon ; it {hould know the whole body of the na
tion, but distinguish none of the individuals who
compose it : What then is a legal government ?
It is not an agreement made between a superior
and an inferior, but a convention between a whole
bodv with each of its members, which convention
is a lawful one, because founded on the rights ot
man ; it is equitable because it is common to all ;
it is ufeful because it can have no other objedt than
the general good ; and it is solid and durable be
cause secured by the voice of the people.
Such a government will protcft and defend,
with its whole force, the person and property of
every one of its members, and every individual
citizen, by uniting himfelf to the whole, will, ne
vertheless, be obedient only to himfelf, and wiil
remain fully at liberty to every thing but injury.
The intention for which a man refignsany por
tion of his natural sovereignty over his own ac
tions is, that he may be protected from the abuse
of the fame dominion in other men. No greater
facrifice is therefore neceflary than is prelcribed
bv this objed. Nothing can be more fallacious
than to pretend that we are precluded in the social
Hate from any appeal, to natural rights. 1 hey
remain in the'ir full vigor, if we except that fmali
portion of them which men facrifice for protection
against each other. Whenever a government as
sumes more power than this object rigorously pre
scribes, it becomes an usurpation supported by so
phistry ; a despotism varnished by illusion.
If life be a bounty from Heaven, we rejeÂ£t the
nfrj)left part of the gift if we tamely surrender our
natural and unalienable rights, without which the
condition of human nature is not only miserable
but contemptible. To preserve them inviolate,
free citizens (hould always be armed with force
and constancy, and should repeat every day the
faying of the virtuous Palatineâ'Alalo pcriculofam
hbei tatcm quam quietum fervitium.
