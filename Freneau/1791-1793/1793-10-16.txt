THA T Sin is tlie cause of our prrfem
distress, is evident from the word o!
God. Fro Â» ills earliest ages Â»f time,
dokvn to t!i? prefsnt day, (In has caufcd the
overthr j\v of nation and kingdoms. Sin
lias 'brought famine, sword, pe'.lilence,
earth-quake i, iid terrible florins upon,
tli 'cr.lJ t of men, and f.vept t[iem from
the fa.:e of the eart.i by thoufamis. If we
fo.io .v the evil ways of p ill ages, r .ve may
ex-K \ the Great Rein; will visit lis in like
man.er. We have been highly favored,
as a people. fh. Lord has given us of
the fruits of the earth, ill abundance, for
onrfop'-ort : he has delivered us from the
oppfe'iion of a foreign nation, and from
the t vaiiat'ons and horrors of war. What
reru 1, ii ive we nude ? Few tit inks for
th bie lings and cemf irts of Ide : the
bravi officer. the b'ld Joldier, receives Â»sll
th-Â»p..:*.V if our deliverance. The au
thority <>r God is disregarded ; his law*
are trampl-d under foot; and now the
offended Majelty of h-aven is vifitmgus
for our traalgrellioris, which are great in
deed A few of tiiem I lhall briefly men
tion, which have in times palt brought
down the wrath of God upon mankind.
And firl-t, and molt |)articnlar, is the lin
of Sabbath-breaking. In Exodus, ch. 31,
v. 14, the Lord commands, faying, " Ye
IHal! k;up holy the Sabbath any, therefore,
far :t i: hÂ»>y unto \au: every one th.it de
filith it, (halt surely be put to death, for
wh fnever dieth any work therein, thatjoul
Jh'i'l he cut off from among his people."â
Now, arc we not guilty in this refpeft !â
Only let us take a view of the conduit of
toe inhabitants of Philadelphia. There are
thousands that pay not even an external
regard to the Day. Our new market was
crowded on every Sabbath morning with
fellers and buyers. Many (hop-keepers
Were there too, felling as 011 other days of
the week. Others make this sacred day a
day of labour. Whole families reserve
the Snbbwh for the common duties of
houfe-worlc, according to a new fafhion in
troduced amongst us. The day is also
prophaned to the vile purposes of, card
playing,and pUyingon muficalinflrumerits.
Thousands take their pleasure 011 this day,
fame in boats on the river, end others ri
ding out in carriages to country places.
The commons arc ipread over with people
walking from one place to another. Those
of the (irft ra'ik and account in tne city
are frequently seen passing the day in pub
lic houses, talking about the times, and
to hear news.
In the winter season, liorfes and sleigh.<
are seen (banding from morning to night
and to midnight, 011 the Sabbath, to carr)
;people through the city for small funis
Hundreds, at the fame fealon, spend th<
Day i i fkiiting upon the ice. In faÂ£t, wt
have hardly le)t room for the lavage, un
tutored Indian to go beyond us in trans
gression ! âTo what a height has wicked
ness arisen among 11s I The minds of manj
people are so led away with the invention;
of the grand enemy of fouls, that thej
hardly know what the Omnipotent Creatoi
requires of them. Many of the citizen;
have voted for, and the remainder have
permitted a synagogue for Satan to be
ereÂ£ted in our city, to debauch andcorrupl
the minds of the people. How were they
deluded that advanced large funis of mo
neyâthey that fold the ground whereon
to raise this fynagogue âthey that wrought
at its interior decorations, and that too on
the Sabbath day IâOur rulers would have
been ailive in putting a stop to these things,
if they had been men that really feared
God, and were a terror to evil doers. But
at this moment, for any care of theirs,
wickedness would be fuffered to go on,
and that by authority, were it not that the
Almighty has interrupted it by viiiting us
with the deadly pedilence.
Many plead for these innocent aniufe
ments (as they call them) and fay that a
good Play is edifyiÂ«g. But the word of
God declares they aie fools, and that so
much of our time as is not spent in the
service of God, is spent in the fervic* of
the devil ; and that for every idle word
that men (hall speak, they (hall give an ac
count in the day of judgment.
To the aforementioned lins msy be ad
ded, the (ins of extortion, oppression, pride,
tr.hojpitality, aid injujlice, that prevail in
our city.âYe landlords 1 how many of
tiic poor and uiibefrjeiided part of our ci
tizens have groawed beneath the burden of
a heavy rentâso heavy, indeed, tli3t the
(canty rewards of severe and unremitted
labour, have been totally swallowed lip in
your exorbitant demands, leaving nothing
or next to nothing, to supply the moll ur
gent neceflities of their families 1 How
ma 1 :)' have fhrurtk into the cheerfefj hut o
poverty, that your cruel i.varice migh'
he gratified ; that you might be enabled ti
uphold your pride, to erect lofty build
i to keep grand carriages, with pam
>ered horf-.-s ; to wear gaudy apparel ; ant
to fitpport a fpii it of disdain tow ards thofi
who are not so rich yonrfelves, or wtit
ire of inferior ftatious in life.
How many bushels of wheat, given by i
icnign Providence for the support of na

city 1 Hist paflaee of fcripiure which faitt
that pride voeth before humility, and c

las made it dangerous to vilit on the Sab

He fSas likewise difcovcred to us another
ijc for carriage! than carrying the fnliabi
ants of Philadelphia about for purpofe-s
)f pleasureâand that is, to convey the cisai
bodies of our citizens to their graves !
Little did the people think, at the time
hey were hankering after another Thea

hat the one fin of labouring for the com

ine tragtdies, u hose sole tendency is, tc
tttacH the minds of mÂ»n to the vanities'ol

;ives an account of a number of tragica
events, onein particular, at a certain pe
riod of time, that drew the attention ol
tngels, and made devils tremble Iâthat o'
he fufferings and death of the Lord o:

f these will not fnffice, the Lord will ex
libit an event in onr city, of such a nature
is to terrify the people from venturing ir

for the benefit of the two Hates, shall be
determined in a particular aÂ£t.
10,. The ratification of this treaty (hall
be exchanged w itliiu the space offix weeks.
The delegation in the firll conference
which they have had with the minister of
Ruflia, represented to Mill the in.pi flibiluy
which they were under, to enter into a
deliberation upon the fubjeft of the second
artiile, which is to be the br.fis of the
whole treaty, since thtv were not at ali.au
thorifed to accede to inch a step. Upon
which count Sieve's, in two different notes,-
infilled that the diet thould invell the dele
gates with unlimited powers, which, after
lonig Jt;bates in the diet, was at lall grant
ed.
The Prtifii.m ambassador delivered in
likewise a note to the diet, in which he re-
Ljuelled that a delegation Ihouid treat witll
nm in the fame manner as with the mini
tier tÂ»f Ruflia.
General CusTlJje isno ttibre; by accounts

was such that they tore his body in piece*.
* The following were the fubifancc- of the
:bnrges that were adduced agcinfl him.'
First. That at the firif lig?t of the enemy

ug them to penetrate into the interior part
3t France,& replunge then:r'">n in slavery,
js foona the infurredlion in the depart
ments became general.
That he placed none but suspicions cha
racters at the head of the different corpi
under his orders, that he m-fght be able to
imitate Dumouricr, if he-had remained in
hi* poif.
That he made papillots of the decrees
of the Convention, and arrefled the nati-i
onal commiflioner Celliot, for having dif
tributecl amohgthe troops the journal of
the mountain.
That, whenever he p'enfed, he disarmed
such of his troop 1 ! as ritd not embrace his
views,to arm those who erpouferf his cause,
and exercised the power ot'iife and
over his soldiers.
Th-.t lie abandoned Mentz to its fate,
though he had offered with his head to an
fuer for its fafety, and weakened the armv
deAined for its relief, under pretence of
railing the liefi,e of Conde, which iit fnffei*-
cJ t-o bis taken, and of V slenciennes, t'Â»rthe which he iV.d not fn?.ke the

We have now in our pay on the continent
thirty thousand men, avowedly to take

â where, whatever we might take, was to

It was a part of the beneficent project of
the war, to ttarve about twenty-five milli
ons of people, and a cos-don was drawn
all round France for thispurpofe. We en
tered into treaties for the purpofc of en
gaging all the princes of Europe to join the
confederacy, and our ambalfadors have bul
lied such of the princes as have had tiie./V/-
famy to secure to their fubjecU tfie blellings
cf peace. YH't cffc&s has this wife and

'is the impulsion that -the criife of liberty

The deeds of miniftrv, are the deeds of

Hessian treaties, wefe""matÂ»e known to pa^ j
liameÃt only on the 1 alt day of its public
btifinefs. But there is Irill ahothfer treaty
to be disclosed, the treaty with Auilria.
That fiich a treaty exists, is plain; for
Cowde and Valenciennes a!*e appropriated
to Airftria, though the latter Was taken by
the combined force*. Nay more, a board
(or junto) ii formed for managing this, and
other future conquelts. , Can this be with
out a treaty ? but where is that treaty
made known f it is to be found in no ga
zette : it lies only in that large mngaz'iiJe
of treachery, the cabinets of princes.
The wickedness of the grand Duke oi
Tufcany ; in attempt! !g ro keep his'fub

FRENCH GENERALS.
The French eXcuse theiry?r latUitv r efpeft
iwg their generals in the following manner:
Pe Bouille, they fay, planned th fl s;ht
of the kin:*. Luckner was a foreigner,
and was supposed to love money without
loving liberty. .Rodvambeau's goodqudi
ties were in efteein, but doubting his own
popularity, he resigned of his own motion :
La Fayette car-fled His politics and in
tt-igue? into the army, and they were at lalfc
tuought of the wrong fort. Dumourier.
like De Bouille and La Fayette, turned
himfeif off; and after firft difplacxng Ls
-Bourdonnaye, and bringing Miranda into
quefHon, he led Valence, E&alite, and o
th.M's into an avowed conspiracy.
Cuftine, alike fcurriilons to his enemies
and his colleagues, at lait attacked the Con
vention, whom he called brawlers, and in
want of a dictator like himfeif ; and he
was therefore soon defer ted, when he was
found deserted by fortune.
Wimpfen, who never enjoyed full confi
dence, has declared, like several of his pre
decefTors, that the Convention does not
polfefs any confidence from him. Biron,
who was of the high nobility, a quondam
Orleanite; and looking for large inherit
ances, was thought to be toodiiatory against
the infcrgents, not to have a fellow fepiinjj
for them.
Servan had a heavy charge toanfwer, in
the defeneelefs flateoi the frontier towards
Spain. Kelierman, though still in com
mand, is known only as a soldier ; and has
not fvrflicient talents to five him, fnould
any suspicions prevail refpeÂ£ling his patrio
tism VVefterman was proved to be a ma
rauding adventurer, both iii Flanders aud
La Vendee.
On the whole, the French fay, that an
army is a-machine, and the general is the
foul of it; that it would be idle to con
tinue a general after he was fufpe&ed of
being less attached to his employers, than
to their enemies ; that to change is an evil,
but to be betrayed is a far greater evil ;
that many of their changes have been fatis
factory to their armies, and even prayed for
by them ; for when men riifc their lives, it
is at Jeaft a confojation to know,, that they
haveâ¢ oftener merited cenfuie for men
they have kept, than for the men they have
difmilled ; that events have almoit urivcr
fally proved their suspicions to be founded;
and that as their firlt general.- were 'kings
men, their next confliuitionalifls. and their
third set Girondifls, no wonder that they
were each displaced by the fucceedii g par
ties. That in our civil wars in .-Charles's
tftne, generals were in the public
interett, the next m the Prefbyter'in, and
the next in the Independent; and yet they
carried through their point for tae trme
That the duke of Ormond, and the French
generals under the monarchy, were gene
rally changed, when there were ch mges
at court, and sometimes from mere caprice
9i" intrigue. That tjie senior officers in
their armies at present, are natrraily full
of old prejudices; it w'rli be (ome time be
fore thtfe are weeded (r \\ orn out, and
tlic new cies fill their placcs; and that 3'
every new choice of a general i. an expe
riment. on account of their new circum
w inces, it is not wonderful that fjme.of
their be unfortunate.
i\ut in the'.m .-an ti-ff, they fay, that as the r
army, en the whole, hangs together, and
is to > vafoto lÂ»e ddinoli&fd at once, time
will ascertain the ability a::d fidelity oi
th- ir officers; and France having never
had half so many men armed in its defence
nor its people half'fo much ar.imat <1, tl.t
allies will become bankrupt and diihanded.
belo. e tlie conqu'eft of France can be con
cluded. If they are right in this, then it i;
pretty clear, that England is in the wrong
in its mad crulade; and that a fyfiem oi
bribery cannot go very far in a country,
whe: f the attors ere changed so often.
The return of Lord Cornwall!*, fron

Extrafb of a letter from BriiflyÂ«, Atir:- 'â¢
" The day before yesterday the whole
city was full of incendiary pslting bills, in
which rhe French emigrants were invited
to take arms, to prevent the difmeuiber
ment of their unfortunate country, on ibe
poii . of being effpfted, like that of roiund,
by the combined powers.
" These bills were immediately torn
down, so much the more so, as it is deeply
felt here, as well as elsewhere, that, in the
present circumflaaces, the partition of un
happy Poland, and tie proceedings towards
the Diet at Grodno, do infinite i, jury to
the cai'.Je of Sovereigns "
The government of the Anftrian Nether
lands has discovered, or pretended to dis
cover, that the emigrant French aristocrats
believing that the combined powers aim
only at trie difmeinberment of France, have
entered into a confpiraoy, cf what nature is
not defcribcd, with Dumonrier. Great
numbers of them have been taken into
cuftorly, particularly at BrufiVls ; Dumon
rier hinifelf, as our readers hsve been in
formed, made his escape about two hours
before the arrival of tiie persons fÂ»:it to
apprehend him ; r.nd such is the extent of
filfpicion, and the "rigor of .frarch, that 110
Frenchman, whether aristocrat or demo

the jurisdiction of the Anftrian govern
ment.

From the Baltimore F.vening PoO.
To the Editor of the BaltiSioue Evem
ing Post.
Sir.
SINCE ray r turn from Norfolk I have
learned win no fin â¢!! tincafmefs, that, an
" Kxtraft of a letter IVom a gentleman tra
velling to the fonthvyard," %\hich has been
I j uMifhed i:i on? 11the PJjilndelphic
j lid tfjence copied into the Baltimore liven
; ing Port of the 26th, lilt, lias been generally
ascribed tome.. I therefore thinkit incum*
b.*nt on me, in the mo.ft politive and ex- (
1 eft manner, to afTure the public, that I
neither wrote, dilated, nor publifned a
n ;!e line of it.
'i'he similarity of some of the circum
(lannces mentioned in the Extras, tothofe
which occurred on niv arrival at Murray's
tavern, the place v here the guard waÂ«
placed, renders it necessary to enter into
lome detail on the fubjech
In writing to my family after my arrival
at Gray's gardens, I informed them, that
I had been flopped with tjje whole r.f the
paflengers, twelve In number, about two
miles from Baltimore: that we were dm en
out of the tavern ; into which, during the
absence of Murray, we had entered ; that
one of the guard had threatened to fire
at me three times for walking within his
lire, although I was uninformed of the
e-tent of it: And, from the darkness of
the night, it whs hardly pollible to distin
guish it, even if he had eonde/cendcd to
point it out, which he negle&cd to do:
that for the fame offeucf he had flruck an
elderly Frenchman on the cheek with his
bayonet ; that we flcpt or dosed in the
flage for three or four hours; that then
finding ourselves cold and uncomfortable
we kindled a fire in the wood?, and llept
before it, some on trunks, and others m
thegrafs; that at 8 o'clock next morning,
when the landlord was at breakfafl, we ("1 n:
to him for some victuals, which he very hu
manely refufed to give us; that about
ten, or half after ten, he relented, and
Tent to inform It?, we might ha\e some
bread, cheese, cyder, and wine; that t. e
accepted the offer ; that we were detained
. 1 this manner (a lady, the wife ot a French
captain, in the company.) without any
shelter but. the rtage and the woods, from
8 o'clock Tuefdayjiight, until VVeclnefday
afternoon ; and that I then remained at
Gray's 't: 11 tiie Alexandria stage set off.
All this 1 wroteâand this only.âAnd I
challenge any man to disprove a iinglS cir
cumttance of it. M. Tiebout, command( r
nl the French veil<_ 1, now lying at Fell's
Point, 'one of the paflengers, can, and, if
applied to. will confirm every article of
it. If it'be criminal to write the tiuth,
I acknowledge myfelf a criminal.
1 pnrpofely Wave, as foreign to my pre
sent pnrpofe, every enquiry, whether all
the precautions Eeceflary for the preferva
ion of Baltimore, are not compatible with
Fome degree of attention to the ease and
Convenience of travellers; whether tents
t>r temporary (beds ought not to beereited j
whether (topped on their jotir
acy, ought not to be secure of being able,
when in nece'fity, to purchase proviiinns;
whether meafiires of wl ich the legality iÂ»
cunfeffedly queiTinnable, and which no
thing but tile paramount law of felf-pre
lervation conld jullify, ought not to be
carried into effect, with_the ntmoil lenity.
These, and a variety of other enquiries,
which arise from, and are int inately con
netted with a difcuflion of this fubjei!, I
leave to abler peas to inveftigare.
To return to the Jpurhis extract of a
letter. At my return home, I may perhhpA
b; able to trace it to its real author, and to
[peak politively on the fhbjefl. But for
t ie prclent, I can only account fnr it, ly
f'jpp -iiâ¢ 1â  1 tha: the Editor o! the Phiiadel

hand, of the contents of my letterâmil
th#n bathed up the garbled, rmfreprefent
ed account into " , n e-trait if a letter,'"
as an article of intelligence. This. I be
lieve, wiH bj ultimately found to be the
real Hate of the affair ; for I am f.tisfied
to be branded as infamous, if the fabrica
tor, or publisher of the extract, can p. o-,
duce any person to whom I \yrote it, or
prove, or even render ii probable, that it
was taken from any letter of mine.
A writer, who figus himfelf L 'Philo Ve

renfuresthe Baltimore printer forthe " lf

' & 'HE j -efent crisis is important to the
1 world in general. The llruggle of
expiring defpotifrn will eventually be pro
ductive of consequences with the fate
of millions yet unborn. Such as can view
the present fra with the eye of indifference
/null be calousto feeling and poffcfs a ilo
ical insensibility. Patriotism cannot influ
ence their hearts. Let the idea of the
subjugation of France be once admitted,
r.nd th * mir.dof tk-'true Patriot, the friend
of mankind is filled with painful sensations
in contemplating tVe consequent m-.ftry,
f ndiag the extinction of that sacred fire
which now animates the breads of free
dom's sons in the eastern world. Religion,
if paR experience proves anything, would
become subservient to the bafell purposes.
Calculated by its divine author, to pro
mote the happiness of mankind ; an'
Fraught with sentiments declaratory of
on earth, and good will to men ; it
would be converted into rhe tool of def
potitm. and the chain of arbitrary power,
by the monlhous conjunction of church
and Hate. The gueftion in despotic courts
is not what religion is acceptable to God ?
They enquire not whether the articlts of
their creed conefpond with divine revela
tion ? The aspiring despot, and the subtle
courtier form an eccleiiaflical establishment
which moit effectually Lcures to them the
poffeilion of aflumed power, and the de
pendence of th .r slaves.
Civil liberty, which once Stimulated the
brave Americans to the noblefl a.sts of
heroism, would on!y be remembered as 2
pieafir.g dream by the mcutners furround
â ing her sacred urn. The generous patriot
would lament in secret the misery of man,
condemned to tread the rugged paths of
life i:i chains- The parent, who once en
joyed the blefiings- of freedom, would
drop tiie sympathetic tear, while reflecting
on the mferable fubjedlion to which his
children are born. The ndultiioas hus
bandman, and the humble mechanic, find
ing no security in the pofT'ffion of their
well earned property, would relax in their
pursuits after honeit gain. Supinenefs
would pervade the wretched fuljeds of ty
rants, and the hand of industry would be
enfeebled. Taxation without representa
tion ; trials without juries, oppreflion with
out redress ; the unnatural degradation of
the multitude, an! unmerited exaltation
of court fy copharts and worfliippers in the
temple of monarchy, ;*re the prominent
features of the monger that strives to raise
its diminilhed head, and uni
vcrfal dominion over mankind. The en
lightened mind of man recoils at the bare
pr bability of the extinction of reason,
and the triumph of defpotifrn. Shrrl ty
rants again fatten on the foil manured with
flavcry, and watered with the tear of op
pnlTi 'i ? S'all the votaries of defpotifrn,
more impious than Moloch's worlhipper3,
et the head of hcllile bauds, again desolate
the world, and deal misery and death with
unsparing hand among the innoccnt vit\-
jmS of their rage ? Forbid it Heaven !
This is the period which decides the
important queilion, (hall man be free ?
Such are the views which prsfent to the
mind of Americans in ant cipating the
â¢ conquest of the patriotic French. Every
good citizen, however, deprecates the evil.
They feel interfiled in the eventful ftrug
gl ; while gratitude, duty, sentiment, the
common cause of liberty, with perforative
eloquence, demand the infant arm of Ame
rica to relieve a filler in diflrefs. Interelt,
too, if reveriionary blefiings are worth Se
curing, points out the propriety of render
ing eS'edlive assistance to our injured ally,
if required. Despising the motives which
influence the friends of monarchy in Ame
rica to aflume a dove-like appearance by
talking of the blefiings of peace, and the
advantages of neutrality, they dare ttot
pnrchafe these at the expence of Ameri
can faith and republican virtue. When
these gentlemen become the advocates of
peace in Britain, and condemn the breach
of neutrality there, their sincerity will be
less doubted.
The hackneyed argument in favour of
a renunciation of our alliance with France,
arising from the condemnation and death
of Louis Capet, is unworthy a serious re
ply. If the exifling treaty had been en
tered into for the mutual guaranteeing
the heads of the higt contrasting parties ;
if the extinction of privileged orders in
France, or the ereilion of arillocracy in
America bad been (lipulated as causes of
.disunion , then the treaty would be equally
aTFe&ed in its operation, by the decapita
tion of Louis in France, or the creation
of an arillocratic rule here. The execu
tive of the United States, and the French
miniilry, as the representatives of the king
their matter, in the formation of that treaty
mutually engage, on the behalf of their
refpeftive nations, for the peiformance ol
articles stipulated, equally advantageous to
the citizens of both countries with refpeft
to commerce and war. It refp'fted not
the internal government of France or A
merica ; and no relative change in the
conllitutiou or policies of either can ann\:l
those obligations or render the treaty inef
feiShial. While, therefore, tl e goo 1 faith
of France is experienced, Republican A
meiicai>s will rejoice in the alliance, and
render all the â¢iflitlance (he claims in the
hour of her ditlrefs from the unsophisticat
ed conftrutiion of the bond of union.
The late decree of the National Conven
tion of France, announced to the public
by Mr. Secretary Jefierfon, which ope
rates so advantageously for the commercial
interest of the United States, and displays
â¢he of magnanimous France,
should raise a conftious blufii on the cheeks
of tho e who have wounded the honour ol
America bv fophi ticating, and explaining
away the felf-evident meaning of words,
and the idea of treaties.
Tell it not in B:itain, publilh it not in
the (Ireets of London, that the civil au
thority of America hath been exerted tc
punish as delinquents her citizens for en
gaging in the common cause of mankind
â under the banners of France in oppoting
her numerous foes, led the votaries of del
potifm tiiumph in the defection of the
leaders of our country, and rejoice in the
extiriflion of that flame from whence the
lons of Gallia derived their sacred fire.
Citizen Patriots, can yoarefufe the tri
bute of gratitude due to the TWELVE
who, defpifingthe influence of a felf-confe
quentialexpounder of law, ftaodnoklyfirm,
hnd disappointed the hopes of an aspiring
fa&ion .' And (hall the verdi6to of juries
be despised ? Shall the citizens of Ameri
ca, the volunteers in the caule of man, be
Hill pursued by niiniflerial vengeance?
Doth Balak, the prince of Moab, hope
by change of time and plsce to curse the
people ? Disappointment and flume shall
succeed the attempt, and America fhail

We have fought several days fuccefively,

heard that the bridge of Ce, was guarded
by four thousand men : we in consequence
approached within a league of it 011 the

morning, we ranged our small army in or

" The enemy fullered us to approach

twelve pieces at us.âWe immediately cri
ed out, the sword of God and Louis hisfol

thousand men, put them all to the sword,
and took all their artillery. There, on the
bridge dyed with the blood of the enemies
of God, we made the air resound with the
praises of the Lord, whose exterminating
angel undoubtedly marches before us.
