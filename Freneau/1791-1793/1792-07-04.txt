RULES
For chan~iny a limited Republican Govern
ment into an unlimited hereditary one.
I. TTT being neceff.iry, in order to effect
X * >e char>g. .to get rid of constitu
tional shackles, and popular prejudices, ail
ofiible rnenns and occaiions are to be
liiv ' f-' both these purposes
11. Nothing being more likely to pre- â¢
pare the vulgar mind for aristocratical
ranks and hereditary powers, than titles
endeavor in the offset of the governmen, to
confer these oil its moil dignified officers.
If the principal magiflrate should happen
to be particularly venerable in the eyes of
people, take advantage of that fortu
nate circumstance in setting the example.
111. Should the attempt fail, thro' his
republican aversion to it, or from the dan
ger of alarming the people, do not aban
don the enterprize altogether, but lay up
the proportion in record Time may gain
it respect, and it will be there always rea
dy cot and dried for any favourable con- ;
juncture that may offer.
IV. In drawing all bills, resolutions,
and reports, keep constantly in view that
the limitations in the constitution are ul
timately to be explained away. Prece
dents arid phrases may thus be shuffled in,
without being adver ed to by candid or
weak people, of which good use may af
terwards be made.
V. As the novelty and bustle of inaug
urating the governrn lit will for some time
keep the public mind in a heedless and
unsettled (ta f e let the Prtfs, during this
period be busy i > propagating the doc
+ r |oo. . ( ::J, r.cy. For
this purpose it wid be particularly useful to
confound a mobbifh democracy with a re
prefenlawe republic, that by exhibiting
all the turbulent examples and enormities
of the former, an odium may be thrown
on the char cter f the latter Review
all the civil contcfts, convuUions, fictions,
broils, iquabbles, bickerings, .lack eyes
and bloody noses of ai eient middle, and
modern ages, caricatti e them into the
moll frightful forms and colours that can
be imagined, and unfold one scene of the
horrible tragedy after another, 'till the
people be made, if pofiible, to tremble at
their own fliadows âLet the discourses onâ
then contrail with these pi&ures < f terror
the quiet of hereditary fucceffiori, the re
verence claimed by birth and nobility,
and the fafcinating influence of (lars, and
ribbands, and garters ; cautiously suppres
sing all the bloody tragedies and unceas
ing oppreffijtii, which fonn the history of
this fpecits of government. No pains
should be spared in this Dait of the under
taking. for the greatell will be wanted, it
being extremely difficult, especially when
a people have been tao -lit to .eafon and
feel their rights- to "ouv nee them that a
king who is alway ei.uiyto the peo
pie, and a nobility who are peril ps fli'l
moie so, wiiltek- v -e. <er care of the peo
ple than the people will take of them
selves.
VI. But the grand nojlrum will be a
public debt, provided enough of it can
be got, and it be medicated with the pro
per ingredients. If by good fortune a
debt be ready at nand, the mod is to be
made o r it. Stretch it and swell it to
the utmoll the items will bear. Allow as
many extra claims as decency will permit.
Assume all the debts of your neighbours:
In a word, get as much debt as can be
raked and scraped together, and when you
have got all you can "advertize" for
'more, and have the debt made as big at
pojfible. being accomplished,
the next will be to make it as perpetual as
pcjfibl*-, and the next t > that, to get it into
r.s feiv bands as pofftbls. The more cf
feilually to bring this about, modify the
debt, complicate it, divide it, Subdivide it,
XubtraCt it, pollpouc it, let there be one

third of two thirds, and two thirds of one
hird, and two thirds of two thirds; iet
there be three per cents, and four per
cents, and iix per cents, and present fix
per cents, and future fix per cents. Tl
be b ie', let the whole be such a mydery
that a few only can understand it ; andle;
ail poffi'ilc opportunities and informations
rail in the way of these few, to clinch thei
advantages over the many.
VII ft mult not be forgotten that the
members of the legislative body are to have
a deep (lake in the game. Thi3 is an es
sential point, and happily is attended with
no difficulty. A (uffic : ent number, pro
perly disposed, can alternately legislate
and speculate, and Speculate and legislate,
and buy and fell, and fell and buy, until a
due portion of the property of their con
ftituents has pasTed into their hands to
give them an inter -fl againd their condi
tuents, and to ensure the part they are to
act. All this however mud be carried on
under cover of the closest secrecy ; and it
is particularly lucky that dealings in p?-
per admit of more fecrecythan any other.
Should a discovery take place, the whole
plan may be blown up.
VIII. The ways in which agreat debt,
so conltituted and applied, will contribute
to the ultimate end in view, are both nu
merous and obvious. I. The favour',!:
few, thus possessed of it, whether within
or without the government, will fel the
(launched fealty to it, and will gothrough
thick and thin to iupport it in all its op
preffions and usurpations. 2. Their mo
ney wi 1 give them confequtncc and influ
ence, even among those who have been
tricked out of it. 3. They will be the
readied materials that can be found for an
hereditarv aritho? l *?âic order, v/her.ever
matters are ripe for one. 4. A great debt
will require great taxes, great taxes many
taxgatherers & other officers: & all officers
are auxiliaries of power. 5. Heavy taxes
may produce discontents ; these may
threaten relidance ; and in proportion to
this danger will be the pretencc for a
/latiding army to repel it. 6. A (landing
army in its turn will increase the moral
force of the government by means of its
appointments, and give it physical force
by means of the sword ; thus doubly for
warding the main object.

For the NATIONAL GAZETTE
Mr. Frf.neau,
AS a fubferiber and well-wither to the
National Gazette, I take the liber
ty of advising you again it employing much
of your paper in replying to the court
paragraphs, which appear in the Gazette
of the United States. There needs no
second Daniel to interpret for that paper.
A paragraph in favour of the exdfe can
easily be traced to a gentleman who holds
a pod under that -virtuous system in Balti
'T-.ore. The eulogiums on the frme fyl
tern, in the Pittfbnrgh Gazette, bespeak
their author in every line ; the e flays in
favour of perpetual debt flow from the
brokers and their friendsâthe diigud
fuladulatory incense is applied to the a'i
miniflration, not to the conflituticn ; for
these are different thin s, rs times go.
To prevent abuses of novver, and filcnt
encroachments upon the liberties of the
people, I would recommend that societies
(hould be formed in every county of the
United States upon similar plans with the
following, which I have extracted from a
London publication, and now fend for in
fsrtion in your paper,

THE Marquis tie la F.-.yttU,it is gene
rally believed, together with all the friends
of the French revolution, exerted their
utmost endeavours to nx the 4th of July
(the well known anniversary of American
Independence; for ratifying the constitu
tion of France. It happened; however,
that it was impossible to bring the great
work to a focus sooner than the 14th of
the fame month, a day which has been
and will ever be memorable and celebrated
over Europe. Surely it ought not to be
less noticed in the United States. The
people of America will certainly make
some preparations for celebrating that
day : indeed, it is the next in our ca
lendar to the anniversary of our own
emancipation from arbitrary power and
oppression.
If societies were formed for instructing
the people in their natural and political
rights, the 14th day of July would be ;\
n-ood time for annual meetings of those
Societies, and they would wall deserve the
fame title of that established in London,
'â¢THE FRIENDS OF THE PEOPLE." By
such measures as these we wouid always
be safe from the encroachments of any
administration whatsoever.

LONDON, May 4.
The prince of Hesse Cassel, whose ar
my is said lately to have astonished his
highnefs, by pre fuming to make a demand
of war pay, when likely to De employed in
hostilities, is one of the mod arbitrary
princes of Germany. His dominions are
only ;cc n,; !c-in breadth, but f;. vc'! -
pled, as to enable him to raise 10,000
men without detaching either artificers,
or those employed in agriculture, from
their respective avocations. This prince
was, till a short time since, in the receipt
of a considerable subsidy for troops hired
to Great Britain. Ere long it is proba
ble, a traffic, so ignominious to the dealer
and those who serve, will experience an al
ternation in favour of those wretched peo
ple, who have hitherto submitted to the
intolerable yoke of an unnatural, and, in
this instance, base surrender of their rights
and dignity.
The last letters from Paris advise, that
translations of the constitutional code of
France have been made and published at
the public expence, in the Italian, Spa
nish, and German languages, and are
bought up with the greatest avidity by the
foreigners in that city; this is the revenge
taken by the French nation, on the de!
pots who formed the preposterous project
of oversetting the constitution that has re
llored, or rather established their free
dom.

service. The officers have orders to mak
the flri&ett enquiries to prevent faftici:,
people from mixing with our troops.
Vienna, April 15th. A body of
troops, under the command of Gen. Wal

attended by 21 field pieces, 6 pounders

by 84 pie 's of artillery, fix pounderj,
and 12 mortars, are oil the route for the
Netherlands.
Paris, April 25. The French grand
army has received positive orders to march
in several divifior.s to different posts on the
frontiers ; precautions have been taken
that all the troops may be ready ct the

o;er arrived from, M.Dumourier,the French
Minister, with dispatches to our elector,
requiring him to give an immediate and ca
tegorical answer to thequeftion, " Whe
ther the elector does not acknowledge the
present conflitution as the true and only
conftitutior, of France, or not ?" This ques
tion isafked with a threat, that if the elec
tor does not acknowledge the present con
flitution of France, that the nation will
oblige him to do it. The fame meflage was
sent to Mentz ; and in consequence, couri
ers have been foht to two great powers.
Ley den, Api il xi. Tiie Stadthoider party
here are much displeased with the Englifii
court, for refuting to inform them whe
ther they mean to take any part in the con
stitutional disputes or not. The old patri
otic party are ready for a revolution ; their
manifefto is ready drawn ; they have mo
ney banked, and their correfpondcnce with
the patriots of Brabant is avowed ; and yet
with the knowledge of all this no llep is ta
ken againfl them. The government trem
bles, and contents itfelf with impotent re
monflrances. A general amnesty has been
published. The prerogatives of the Stadt
liokler have been voluntarily diminished.
Orange cockades, shoe-strings, and all ex
terior marks of party on both fides have been
prohibited ; but nothing has availed to re
concile the difcoatented party to the court.
A small anecdote will ffaew to what height
party spirit runs. It is the custom for the
niinifters to pray for the Stadthoider and
his family. âThe inhabitants of Heufden,
as often as the minister began his prayer,
fnewed their difTatisfa&ion by coughing,
fpittinjr, blowing the nose, and scraping with
their feet, so that a word of the prayer could
not be heard in the church, however it
might ascend to heaven. The regency pub
lished an edict, forbidding all coughing,
spitting, and blowing oÂ± nofesduring divine
Service. The citizens were peaceable, but
from that day the churches have been de
serted.
Stockholm, April 6. Orders have been at
last sent to Helfingbourg not to flop travel

have been Hopped to proceed on their way;
their number amounts to upwards of sixty.

Which reigned among one part of the na
tion at the conciufion of the diet of Gefle.
the attempt on the person of the king has
contributed more to reconcile those with
the rosal authority, who were adverse toit,
than to forward the views of the conspira
tors. Of this the young king and the re
gent have received a proof, by a deputation
which waited on them the day before yes
terday, to allure those princes of the loyal
ty and attachment of the four orders of the
diftr'Â£t of Stockholm, and to teftify their
grief at the event which had plunged Swe
den in sorrow, &c. This deputation ha
ving at its head Mr. Ugglas, as governor or
chief of the diftrifl, was coaipofed. of nine
deputies of the nobility, four of the clergy,
five of the citizens, and seven of the order
ofpeafants. Among the firft were some
noblemen who were the chief opponents of
the court; the nine deputies were Count
de Brake, Count A. Lcwenhaupt: the firft
jrentleman of the chamber, Fabeau Wrede;
the Baron Charles de Geer : the Chamber
lain, Lieut. Gen. Maurice Kingfporre ; the
Gentleman of the Court. Lejonmark ; the

lor of the Mines, Febure; and the countel
lor of the Chamber, Lagerkeim.
Aukarftrom has been found guilty and
sentence of death will probably be pafled
on him in the cor.rfe of the week.
London, May w A letter from an Fngnili
gentleman at Peterfburgh, gives a very cu
rious account of the present slate of thft
court. The muftler of the king of Sweden
made a iirong impreffton on the empress;
but it gave such an alarm to the Arch-duke,
as was perceptible to every one. He talk
ed publicly of plans being formed to carry
him off; and in a ronverlation with her ma
iefty, he fpolJfe in the raoft unnieaftired
"terra", deporting himfelf, fays the letter,
" neither as a son, nor as a fubjeft." The
health of the Empress is not merely on the
decline. There is evidently a thorough
breakup of her conftitutiou. Her death,
though in will make no change in the abject
condition of the people, will be the ifira of
a material change i 1 the empire, for it is
iikely to be divided.

EXCISE LAW.
y7* QUAL liberty is the great boast of the
Hi citizens of Pennsylvania, but it is not
exemplified in the operation ot two laws
now existing withiii this commonwealth â
The one prohibiting the irrational and
cruel amusement of horfe-racing âThe
other restricting the indultrious farmer
from making the belt advantage of proper
ty acquired by his own industry. As the
tirft interferes with theplcafures ot our apes
of Bi itii'h nobility, we fee it violated wiih
impunity : But the farmer ever complain
ing of the injury and insult of ail odiousEx
cife Law, he is at once stigmatized as an
enemy to government, who ought to be
punilhed for not submitting quietly to the
laws of his country. âThele diftinftions
and partialities among citizens cannot long
continue.

BANK.
AS the public disposition to examine the
constitutionality of the bank is evident
ly increasing, and recent attempts have been
made by the interested, to throw dust into
peoples' eyes, on this fubjeft ; it be
proper to fuperadd to the many folic! objec
tion; which have been enforced against it,
the following very serious ones, which I
have several times heard in conversation,
and have not yet seen in print. If I have
rightly comprehended them, they stand
thus :
1. Congress make the bank. The bank,
by the authority of Congress can create of
fices and affix salaries, payable too in part out
of monies of the United States. Every member
of Congress can make himfelf a member oi
the bank ; many have done so. As mem
bers of the bank, members of Congress can
vote for directors ; they can be voted for,
and can vote for themlelves to be directors:
some members of Congress are directors.
As direitors, they can receive salaries ; as
itockholders they can vote salaries to them
felvcs as directors, salaries in like mannei
payable in par tout of the monies of the UmtcdStates.
They can, as directors, vote for the crea
tion of offices ; they can vote for the ap
pointment and increase of salaries, iu\\ pay
able in part out of the money of the United States :
they can vote for officers to enjoy these
emoluments ; they can be voted, and cat
vote for themselves, to fill the offices, and
to enjoy the emoluments. âSuch is the
Constitution of the bankâNow for the
Constitution of the United States. â"No
senator or representative {hall, during the
time for which he was elected, be appoint
ed to any civil office under the authority of
the United States, which fhail have been
created, or the emoluments whereof (hall
have been increased during such time, and
no person holding any office under the United
States, ihall be a member of either house
during his continuance in office." Let the
reader consult the spirit and reason of this
reftri&ion, and then the inference may be
left to himfelf.
2. Two millions of the bank-flock is the
money of the United States. As far as this
goes, the offices and salaries for the ma
nagement of it may be conlidered as ftriftly
offices and salaries of the United States :
as much so as those of a commifiioner of
loans or a receiver of taxes. If the stock
and income of the bank belonged wholly to
the United States, the cafe would be difem
barrafled, and the unconflitutionality felf
evident.
3. The Constitution of the United States
is founded on the efiential principle ps na
tural right and political liberty, that those
who are members of a society, and to be
bound by its laws and acts, Ihould have a
voice in its laws and aits. The public is
made a member of the bank. It is bound
by the laws and acts of the bank. Yet what
is allowed in all cases to every freeman is
denied, in this cafe, to the whole body of
freemen. They are all bound by laws,
ordinances, and regulations, in which they
have had no voice, to which they never
give their consent by themselves or their
proxies.
4. It is a principle of the Constitution, a
principle sacred in it (elf, that taxation and
representation go together. Those who
contribute money {hould have a vote in the
management of the common stock. Every
other 'stockholder in the bank, including bo
dies politic and corporate, has rotes in a
certain ratio to his contribution. The peo
ple of the union who are taxed to the
amount of one fourth of the whole contri
bution, are not represented by a {ingle Ivote.
But it was not convenient nor prudent to
allow the public a right ot repreient: tion.
Is it convenient or prudent to trample c.
the eli'ential principles of the Constitution
But the Britiih government lias no vote
in the bank of England.âXsither has it any
Hock Co enti:!i it to a vote. If we are for
Â»ver* measure to look for a model in a fo
-eign monarchy, why violate republican
jrinciples, where the model itfelf does not ?
Why make the things we copy inconsistent
with themselves, as well as with our Gon
[titution ?

ExtraÃs from the Quebec Gazette.
Quebec, May, 24. Despotic governments
ire only upheld by the care they take to
liaintain a tyrannical inequality among
:heir fubjefts ; and by force and cunning
preventing the greater number, which
:hey difdainfully term populace, from ac
quiring that knowledge, which would free
:hemfrom blind credulity and mental fla
/ery âAnd the political reason why such
governments do ib, is, because an ignorant
jeople are alwaysinfenfible to perfonalfub
eftion, and fuller themselves to be plun
dered without refidance ; wherefore a
people who, like the Canadians, have ac
quired the liberty to think and ast for their
awn welfare, ought to inform themselves
in every thing, in order to preserve that
liberty* and to reap the fruits of it, so es
sential to the happiness of mankind.
Monday last, a boat going from Quebec
ro Orleans, being overloaded and the wind
blowing hard, overset and funk, and ten
persons out of twelve were unfortunately
drowned. Among the number was the
much esteemed Mr.Hubert, rector of Que
bec.âOn this occasion an old seaman gives
:he following advice to pilots and others,
who conduit undecked boats.â" 1. Re
duce the size of your fails. I have gene
rally remarked that they are greatly dif
jroportioned in this refpeft to the size of

Always keep on board, and which you
nay flow away under your benches, a
ronvenient number of caiks of 20 gallons

ble your boat to be ftiff and carry fail.â
vVitli this precaution, if a sudden flaw of

PUBLIC OPINION IN FRANCE
A judicious view, from concurrent ac
counts founded on liu-I-;, wiil belt er.aMe
an impartial obfcrver to judge rightly of
the present iituation, and future event of
t'.ie French Revolution. âLet us, in the
firft place, calt a contemplative view on
the fittfatiou of mindi ill France. We may
diftingnifii five clafes of citizens of differ
ent sentiments. In one are all the invete
rate enemies of the revolution, a'l there
bels driven from Coblentz, srd all the fa
natical priests, enemies to liberty and the
profperity of man. This insane band have
faith in the return of despotism, of the re
eftablifliment of the clergy,' and of the par
liaments ; but their chiefs who acknow
ledge that the total return of the ancient
system is importable, are ambitions only of
the re-eftabiiftiment of the ncllefse and tie
adoption of a conftitnticn nearly confcrm
able to that of England.âDoubtkfs the
emigrated princes do not think of re-efla
blilhingthe parliaments, whose pride and
power they always dreaded, any more
than the order of the clergy, a set of men
who had hardly the virtue of hypocrisy,
and who had for ages lorded it over the
nobl'ffe, and whose ill-gotten treasures are
become neceflarv to all parties to restore
the finances and pay the expenses of the
war. A second class who, contraftec! with
the firft, is composed of citizens, who
would have a government, in every
fpeft, republican; but they are very finalÂ®
in number. They do not form a party;
ill they can do is to frame vows. There
is a third class who alone compose two
thirds of the citizens of the kingdom ; it is
thai of the zealous patriots, true friends
of liberty and equality. Their sentiments
are upon a level with the revolution, and
they will support it at the risque of their
lives ; but it is to be confefled that there
are some among them troublesome,
lant and intolerant. A fourth class is x\wT
of the citizens of moderate character and
probity. Their number is great, their in
tentions are pure, and they are for the
ccnftitution, but their principal wiih is
tranquility. Weak and timid, the very
appearance of trouble alarms them : the
enemies of the country avail themselves
of their pusillanimous fears to separate
them from the zealous patriots : they in
cefTantly present to their view theabyfs of
anarchy half open ; they tell them that
[here exists a republican faction who wish
to overturn France, and thatagainft them
:he good citizens ought to unite. These
weak and credulous men are the dupes of
"uch perfidious insinuations. They look
lpon the best citizens as factious, and from
:heirlove of goodnefsand peace unite with
hose who only wear the mask of modera
:ion. The last class is the molt dangerous
jf all: it is composed of a great number
,vho lose by the revolution : but more ef
entially of an infinite number of great pro
srietors of lands, of rich merchants, in
ine, of men opulent and proud who cannot
~uffer an equality, who regret the defiruc
:ion of a nobility to which they aspired;
who finding themselves advantageoudy
placed in the amphitheatre of social fitua
:ions, do not like having their feats remo
ved ; who detefl: the new constitution,
:he mother of equality, but would have
Dne to render sacred the aflumed rights of
iriftocracy. This is the true iitur.tion of
minds in France.

Considerable damage was done by a par

A complete abolition of the African (lave

A debate took place in the English House
of Commons on the 30th of April, relative
to a parliamentary reform. Mefi'rs. Grey,
\ Pitt, F0.,-, and Bulk' were the principal
fpeakerson this occafton. In the course of
the debate Mr. Paine and his pamphlets on
the Rights of Man were brought into view.
Mr. Fox coniidered them as not tending to
a reform,!but to a total .alteration of the
British government & constitution, and that
" Mr. Paine's production was a libel 011 the
government." Mr. Burke pronounced
paine's pamphlet " a libel of the molt infa
mous kind againlt the British constitution, and
that the clubs and fociettel who recom
mended it to be read by the people, were
\lvj avowed enemies o( tile constitution," &c.
It isfoinewHatfurpriling that both Fox and
Burke iliould be ignorant that Mr. Paine is
their countryman, and only a citizen of
America. Fox expressly calls him a na
tive of America; and Burke flyles him " a
stranger (which in one fen(e is true) who
knows just enough of all countries to con
fufe anddiftract all, without being of the
least use 10 any.'' Mr.Fox calls the Rights
of Man a libel; "but it will be remember

On Sunday afternoon last a violent squall
sf wind from W.N. W. and N.W. did con
iderable damage in this city and port. Se
veral fqtiare rigged vessels were driven from

i'ortuftately secured from injury by anchor

and drifting along the island, got aground
ibout a mile below the town, where (he now

Several small craft and boats were also
nuch damaged, but we are happy to hear
:hat no lives were loft, altho' the gale Iwas

t was almort impollible toefcape its fury.
In the city some chimnies and parts of

â¢emoved several inches from its place and
arge limbs torn from many trees in different

" It is said to be in agitation, immediate
y on the arrival of official accounts of open
loflilities between the patriots of France

â¢ailing a body of American volunteers, to

dea was not suggested from a doubt that
:he French freemen are not able to cope
ivith their flavifli enemies; or that they
.vanted any thing to stimulate them toglo
"ious conquest ; but merely to evince the
gratitude of Americans ; and once more to
ilingie their blood with those of their allies,
n defence of the rights of human nature,
should the idea be carried into elfeft, there
s not a doubt that the government of the

liake ample provision for the support and

That (o much corrupt (peculation and avari

truly mortifying to its real fleady republican

and fidelity have yielded to the allurements of

REmov'd from Europe's feuds, a hateful scene
( Thank heaven, such waftcs of ocean roli
between)
Wuere tyrant kings in bloody schemes combine,
And each forebojes in tears ) Manis no longer v.me\
Glad we recal the day that bade us firlt
Spurn at their power, and shun their wars accurst j
Pitied and gaff'd no more for England's ulory
Nor made the tag-rag-bob-tail of their story.
Something still wrong in every system lurks.
Something imperfect haunts a!) human works
Wars mult oe hatch'd unthinking men to fleece,
Or we, this day t had been in perfect peace,
Witn douole oolts our Janus temple Ihut,
Nor terror reign'd through each back-woodsman s
hut,
No rattling drums aflaiTd the peasants ear
Nor Indian )elis Jifturb'd our (ad frontier,
Norgallant chiefs*, 'gainst Indian hosts combin'd
Sicap'd from the trap âto leave their tails behind.
Peace to all feuds ! âand come the happier day
When ReafoDÂ»3 fun {ball light us on our way j
When erring man (hall all his RIGH I S retrieve }
No delpots rule them, and no priests deceive j
'Till liicn Columbia !âwatch each stretch of
power
Nor ll.ep too soundly at the sleeping hour,
B flattery won, ana lull'd by soothing (trains
S ilenus took his napâand wak'd in chai..sâ
In a loft dream of smooth delusion led
Unthinking Gallia bow'd lier diooping head
To tyrant's yokesâand met such bruises there
As now mud talc? three agss to repair.
Then keep the patha of dear-bought freedon
clear
Nor slavish systems, grant admittance hereâ

London, January 14, 179 2,
On the Inequality of the human condition.
What does one dog owe to another, and one
horse to another horse ? Nothing. No anima
â  epends on its fellow ; but man, partaking oi
that (park of divinity called reason, what advan
tage accrues to him from this ? To be a (lave
almod every were throughout the earth !âWen
his earth what it apparently (hould be, that is.
did man every wete meet with an easy, certain
and late subsistence, and a climate suitable to hi:
nature, it is manifeftly impolfible that one mar
â¢ uld have endaved another. When this earth
shall everv were produce salubrious fruits: wher
the air, which (hould contribute to our life, lhal
or bring us sickness and death j when man (ha!
land in need of no other lodging and bed thar
hat of the deer and roe-buck : then the Turk
ill and Asiatic tyrants will have no other domef
:ics than their children, and thele will have fc
much natural affedtion as to aflift them in thcii
old age.
in this so natural (late, which all quadrupeds,
birds, and reptiles enjoy, man would be happy as
they j dominion would be a chimera, an absurdi
ty, which no one would think of j tor who would
make a bustle to get servants without any want
of their service ?
Should any individual, of a tyrannical disposi
tion and extraordinary strength, take it into hi:
head to make a (lave of his weaker neighbour.
t!~Â»e thing would be impracticable ; the party op*
preflVd would be a hundred leagues out of the op
prefi'or*s rfach before he had taken his mealures
Thus a freedom from wants would necefiarily
make all men equal. It is the diflrefs annexec
to our fppcies which fubjtdls one man to ano
ther j not that inequality is a real misfortune ;
the grievance lies in dependence. What fignifiei
one man being (liled his highness, another his ho
liness ?âbut to serve either is difagieeable. A nu
merous family has fuccefsfully cultivated a good
foil, whilst two small neighbouring families can
not bring their flubborn ground to produce any
thing. The two poor families mull either become
servants to the opulent family, or extirpate it j
this is fell"" evident : one of the two indigent fa
milies, for a subsistence, goes and offers its labou:
to the rich ; the other goes to difpolTefs it by
force of arms, and is beaten. The former is the
origin ofdomeftics and labourers, and from the
latter (lavery is derived.
In our calamitous globe, it is impofiible that
men, living together in society, should not be
uivided into two classes, one the rich, who com
m.nd, the other, the poor, who serve or obey:
Thele two are subdivided into a thousand, and
thele thousands have their farther subdivisions
and gradations.
AH the opprefied are nor abfolutelv unhappy :
moll of them being born m a servile (late, conti
nual labour preserves them from too sensible ;
feeling of their situation j but whenever the
feel it, wars are the consequence, as at Romi
between the Plebeian and Patrician parties
likewise those of the pcafants in Germany, EÂ»g
land, and France. All these wars terminate,
soon or late, in the fubjeftion of the people, be
cause the great have money, and money does eve
ry thing within a (late : I fay within a slate } to
between nation 2nd nation it is otherwise. J
nation which handles iron bell, will ever b
too (Irong for that which with its abundance o
gold, is deficient in (kill and courage.
Everv man is born with no small propensity t<
power, riches, and pleasure \ and h.is naturally ;
delight in indolence j consequently every man i
tor having the money, wives, or daughters o
Dthersj would fubjeft them all to his humour:
and do no work, or at lead what only pleafei
himfelf. We may fee that for men with fuchdif
pofitions to be equal is as impolfible as that tw<
jreachers, or two profefi'ors of divinity, fliouh
lot be jealous of one another.
Mankind, in the present date, cannot subsist
jnlefs an infinity of ufeful men have the misfor
tune of being without any poflefiion whatever;
for, to be fure> no man in easy cireumdances wil
plough your grounds \ and if you are in want oI
a pair of (hoes, you mud find some other hand
than a sergeant at law or a jujge advocate, to
make them for you. Thus inequality is, at the
fame time, both the mod natural and the most
chimerical thing in the world.
Men being excelTive in every thing where they
can be so, this inequality has been carried toe
tar, in several governments it is a (landing max
im that a citizen is not allowed to quit the coun
try where he happened to be born : the import
of such a law is visibly this ; the country is so bat
2ud w p-overnedy that lue forbid aÂ»y u bat
rver to go out, Ttaft every hedy should liani
? f ._ A good government will att more wifely,
it will create in its jubje&s a delight to remain, in
foreigners a desire of coming thither.
Every man lias a right believe himfelf nr.ru
rally equal toother men ; but it doe? not from
thence follow, that a Gavoinai's cr.-L wiay Â©roer
his eminence to dress his dinner. The cook, in
deed, may fay, "I am as much a man as my mas
ter ; like him 1 cried at my birth, and he wwl
die in the fame agonies, and amidst the lame
ceremonies as I; the animal funaions are ahke
in both. K the Turks make themfclves inai
tcrsof Rome, and I then come to ue a
cardinal, and my matter reduced to turn cook,
I will take him into my fervice."âTh;rc isÂ»no
thing in this soliloquy but what Â»s rational ana
jult j yet till the grand Icignior makes h.mle I
matter of Rome, the cook is to do his duty, eIU
there is an end of human society.-As ro hiir
who is neither cook to a Cardinal, nor holds an\
Gate employment, a*d who has no connexion en
dependence, but who is chagrined at being ever)
where received either with an air cf protector
or contempt, who plainly perceives that so man)
Lords, Dukes and Esquires have neither mor<
learning, more genius, nor more virtue thar
himfelf, and to whom it is a torment to be some'
times in their antichamber j what would yoi
