A CALL to ARMS agamjl the INDI
ANS
ROUSE, countrymen of Georgia, rouje 1
AMISUNDKRSTAInDING with die
red people of the weft must soon i\\ ake
you all to arms. A thousand tribes are
leagued againftyou. Mutual intelligence
has made iheir counfelsthe fame, from the
fhotes of lake Erie to the Altamaha, a
semicircle of more than acoo miles.
The sachems have agreed on hostilities.
The priefta have performed the rites ol
divination. The conjurer declares the o
niens to be good. The chieftains and war
riors have gone through their feafts and
ablution?, ceremonies devised by the dru
ids of Indians to secure them fuccefi and
a happy return from the towns of their
enemies. They have whetted the knife
and sharpened up the hatchet ot death.
They have brightened their firelocks,
moulded their ball, painted their brow and
their body for war. They are now writh
ing and foaming with the impatience of
furies to take the path, to bend their
march towards the frontiers of your coun
try, to devote to the tomahauk your chil
<lred and wive 3, to drag you as captives to
die by the torture of flames. They only
wait the appearance of thÂ£ appointed
tnoon, and then they raise the whoop of
war, the yeil of devils, to be communicat
ed from wigwam, to wigwam, from town
to town, from mountain to mountain,
from the Mufkoghe, in the Couth, round all
the cicele of Indians to the Miami in the
north, to be re-echoed from the Miami
back to the Mufkoghe again.
Rouse, countrymen, roufej Make ready
to oppose force to force, and art to art.
Federal America has her Warriors tdo;
she can point to many of the vety soldiers,
officers, art I generals, who bore up tinder
a fev?n years' war* against all the powers
of BritainâBritain, great among the nati
onsâBritain, whofc arms had tfiumphed a
few years before in every quarter ef the
globe. Cannot America command some
of the troops of Saratoga still ? some of the
captors of CdrnWallis âConwallis, who
has since become the conquerer of India ?
fomeofrhe choice spirits who fought at
Bennington and Monmouth, at German
town and Guilfofd, at Eutaw and King's
mountain, and the hardy florm of Savan
nah ? Many of thdfe brave men are still liv
ing, the boast of their friends and defence
ot their cdlintry still! kind heaven has held
them in its holy keeping;
Step into the halls where the foris Of
Cincinnatus meet; there feaft your eye:
on the ghllant American officers who de
voted their ease, their health, their for
tunes, and blood, to their country's cause.
directed your thunder in the hour of bat
tle, and led on your sons to the contest oi
arms. These men have fought in the smoke
of battles, these men are no strangers to the
music of artillery. Call: your eyes on any
group of your feilow citizens, and there
you will recognise the features of some
veteran soldiers who never turned pale at
the flafli of a musket, nor fell into ponvul
fions at the explolion of a cannon. Men
who fought before can fight again, and
they who have commanded can command
again; they are of other metal than to flinch
in the day of danger and alarm ; the post
of honour will be fought again. The mi
litary talents of your countrymen may find
an object nowâtalents which have lain
dormant and never been displayed since the
war with Britain.
In point of defence your resources are
ample and good ; you can bring into the
field the foot or the horse ; arms and am
munition awaityour call. You are equal
ly fortunate in point of fubliftence ; hea
ven has blefled the labours of the ye3r
through all the interior country; there is
enough for the citizen, enough fcr the
merchant, and a surplus itill for war.
Rouse, countrymen, rouse I \ ou have too
lone placed a confidence in the faith of a
savage. No treaty can bind a roving horde
whether Scythian, Arab,or Indian. A for
mal pacification with them is a farce.
Treaties have no basis among a people
where tribes and individuals are so inde
pendent of each other. Where folates
& council fires afiume only a Recommen
datory, the social compatt binds with a
very feeble tie. And as for the law of na
tions, it can no more bridle a banditti of
Cowetas, or ChickemaHgahs, than a cage
of cobwebs could confine a tygcr.
The faith of an Indian is like that of the
old Canhaginiam. Pu.ieafiJes it Indica
fides, are of equal merit, the one as
much out of credit among the Americans
aj the other among the Romans. A* the
wants of an Indian are fetv. his claims and
rights are few. The rights of society are too
abllraftedfor the reafonirsg habits of ail In
dian ; he has no idea of any but personal
rightt J it is with relucfancc that he sur
renders any.of these; but if, to conflitute
any thing like a body politic, he can be
brought to yield up part of his personal
right to day, he will infallibly resume them
again on the morrow, if to morrow should
prefcnt him \Vith an opportunity or temp
tation for plunder or carnage.
An Indian never meditates peace any
more than an eagle or & lliark ; war is his
profeflion ; he enjoys it with the fame rap
ture that theÂ» hsund enjoys the chace , his
rage for the gldry of arms llarves every
other passion ; the idea 3of a warrior's
rertown are brought into his compofitiau
from the dawn of reason; they Â£,ro\v as
he grows, and they die not till he dies ; his
favorite dance is martial, and molt of his
longs are on the fubjeft of war.
How many treaties have been negociat
ed with thole cut throats from the Alle
ghaney to the Appalaclie, from the earliest
times to the year 1791, and have those dogs
of war become pacific lkill ? Have they yet
cooled their thirll for blood ? Are they
yet foftened down to humanity and
peacfc ? What fay the dying groans of yo u r
murdered friends, your brethren, your
children? What coakl their gentle spirits
whisper in your ear? What could the
ghosts of the brave Harden and Truemau
tell? Harden and Trueman, both maifa
cred by savage hands while bearing to
their towns the flag of peace. These are
;vents bf recefit date ; but you may call up
the memory of halfacentury palled, call up
the annals of an hundred summers ; point
aut the year in the calendar, if you can,
that has not feeii the foil of America pur
pled With the blood of your citizens, your
countrymen, and friends, their bodies left
to feed the vultures of the valley, and their
banes to grow white in the wilderneis.
What do these fails and these records an
nounce ? Do they witness the good faith
or declare aloud the treachery of Indians ?
Do they crown them as cherubs of peace,
w brand them as furies burning hot from
hell ?
What vifioaaries hare we beenâlooking
for a millennium of peace with a people
incapable of amity and friendfhip. We
have found them such by a thouland tri
lls, and experienced all th e ten thousand
Jifafters bf broken treaties; anil dill out
latefmen adhere to the wretched policy:
\ minifterof warlocks himfclf up in his ca
jinet,(ketches thepreliminartes of a peace.
:o be ratified with a few drtinken l'coun
irels, in the hame of numerous tribes, a;
oofe and detached from each other as the
jands of marauding Saracens beyond the
ied Sea< of no more exiftetice as a bodj
jolitic than Gulliver's Lillipfitiahs. Peace
nakers meet* talks are interchanged; th{
latchet is buriedj the calumet of friend
"hip goes round the circle, a profufion ol
arefentsis made-â presents paid for out ol
pourpockets, a long detail of boundaries i:
ascertained, and peace is to be ffftf.blilbed
on a firm foundation ; and this last and
t>eft of all treaties is to be held mod sacred
by all parties, "while wood grows and
water runs, or till the rivers have flowed
upwards as long as they have descended."
What is the refultof all this parade? What
ire the important purports of (late answer
ed by a treaty attended with all this fo
lemnityand expense.
On the rising of the treaty, the savage
Balks away from the arbor, where you
fealted his squaw's, his dogs and himfeli
for whole weeks together ; he bears home
the presents with which you load him, he
joins with his countrymen in laughing at
the trick iinpofed upon the white people,
in tying up their hands by a treaty, while
the red people are left as free as ever to
plunder, to scalp, to kill, to torture the
prifonersof war; for a savage will nevrr
conceive himfelf bound by the little scratch
he makes on paper with the feather of a
wild goose.
In the mean lime your country is amuf
ed with the dreams of peace. Confiding in
a treaty which had the fanflion of the high
est authority, she fends out her families and
plants them along the line ; there they re
build the honfes burned by the Indians,
and recruit their flocks and their barns;
but look beyond the mountains, fee the
dark savage in his hut; ina&ion has already
chilled his blood, th: bile has gathered
round his heart, and clouds of gloom hang
heavy on his looks; he broods defigni ot
robbery and Uaiighter again ; he fees your
fettiements unfliieldedfrom histomahauk,
a long line of frontiers naked to his insult,
the inhabitants all lulled in security, intenl
on agriculture and the arts of peace, their
fwcirds beaten into plough-shares and their
baydnetsintoprttning hooks, their firelock:
out of order and laying useless by; wit!
the malic& of a fiend he marks them for hi:
prey, with the velocity of a fire flying ser
pent he darts across the forelt with i
ihoufand warriors more, the moment thej
lee the smoke cf your chiinnies they clrau
the hatchet of death, found the whoop o
war, and all the obligations of the treat;
ji> to the de-oil. '
Such are the blc!Ted eftess of Indiai
treaties! Mere political mummery 1 T1 (
theatre of ministerial speculation ! A fecre
:ary*\>f war might as well have gone into hi

;icles of a treaty between the wild pigeon

""pHE game which the enemies to tfie
"â¢ French revolution, who are like wife
notoriously the partizans for monarchy
are now playing, is entitled to pzrticulai
attention: iris the more so. bee; uPe the
poison it contains, is covered, under fpe
ciousand wholesome appears rices,from 1 he
view of those to whom thedofe is intendec
to be adminiltered. A fliort comment
however upon farts, v ill : t is hoped, ex
pose this projefled fcheroe of deception tc
that reproach and censure, it justly merits
from an injured community.
The French minister it appears in prrflT
ing in some inllances, the cause of hii
country and of liberty, upon the Pre
lident of the United States, has expe
rienced some reappointments, anel which
in the fervor of his seal, led him into a de
[Total Numb. igy>]
claration, intimating a belief, that the ge
nefal Sentiment of the people of America,
was more favourable to his country anil to
her cause, than otir executive councils
were : and that he would appeal to this
sentiment. But what were the points in
controverly, or to whom was this declara
tion made ; whether by memorial to the
President, or at a convivial party, or in
tended ever to be carried into effett, lias
not been shewn. The only faâ¬t vvhich ap
pears is that he r.t some tirrie, and at some
place, made this declaration j and this ha 3
been certified with great pomp and Solem
nity by Mr. Jay, the present chief justice of
the United Stares, asd Mr. King, afenator
for the state ofNew-York.
With reSpect to the supposed disagreement,
Uninformed on that head asweare.it can on
ly be fald with propriety at prefent,that the
public have been too long acquainted with
the patriotism of their chief magiflrate, and
his virtuous exertions in the cause ofliber
ty at home, to fufpeÂ£t that he can be indif
ferent to that interefl Sbroatl, and efpeci
allv in France to whom -,ve oivefo much ;
and on the other hand, that they are too
much attached to the great principles of
the French resolution, and to the merits of
that magnanimous nation struggling in tha
best of causes, to bellow their censure upon
any of its upright advocates, and efpeciallv
her Representative, however zealous they
may beâthat the public judgment fhoul.'l
bs suspended upon those great points, until
lifts lliould be correctly ltatetl, upon which
alone it Ihouid be formed ; and that a
different line of conduct v/otild not only
prove the parent of error and injustice, but:
lefl'en them in the eflimatian of the candid
and impartial throughout the world.
But the management, by which this in
cident has bfeen brought before the public,
deserves to be more particularly noticed!
beca-afe its object mult be unfriendly to the
belt intereds of our country.
The operations of the executive muffc
je in some instances, from their nature Se
:ret. A disagreement between that 'de
partment and a foreign minister, whilfl
Lhere was a proSpect of compromise, Ihoulil
be held peculiarly So. It is well known tha:
of that kind, often communicate
themSelves to the nations to which th- par
ties respectively belong, and Sometime*
from the flighted cUnSes, dilSolve the molt
Solid political connections. To adjult
them in private is always the ihtereft ot all
parties, uho wish to cultivate harmony
and whilst the tranSaÂ£>ion is private, where
there has been error, proper explanations'
may be made. But when the controversy
is submitted to the public view, this ami
cable adjustment is either rendered im
practicable, or becomes more difficult.
When therefore it is conlidered that the
belt interests of both countries required
that these Subjects fliould have beendiScufl
ed in Secret, it must be obvious that Some
objea unfriendly to both dictated the pub
lication. Nor can there be much difficulty,
when characters and circumstances arc at
tended to, in discovering what that obieft
is. It is well known tnat there cxifts a
mong us a powerful faflion, who are op
poled to the greit principles of the Frenci?
revolution, and who are likewise much
more attached to the copflitution of Kni
land, than to that of their own country.
To introduce this latter forrfi Of aovern
ment here, upon the ruin of enr own is
believed to be the ruling motive of th!-,
party in all its councils ; and that the dis
solution of our connection with France
would greatly forward that end, must he
too obvious to admit of any controversy.
Xhe principles of the American and French 1
governments are the Same ; they both ex~
elude the idea of hereditary diminutions, and
reft on the fame balls of equality. A?,
friends and allies the two Rations might
mutually Support each other, and there
by at the Same time give dignity tfÂ»
he republican cauSe. But if they IhouUl
)e thrown apart and in opposition, the
:onti ary effect would be produced ; the
ivay would be paved for a more intimate'
:onFieclion with England, and at the ex
)ence of our ally, whereby all the obnoxi
ous political of that country might
:>e introduced among us.
As it cannot redound to the honour nor
the intereftof America.So neither can it be
ihe wish of hercitizensto diftblve theircon
neÂ£lion with France. To force an honed
and independent people to adopt a couiSe
in direct opposition to the molt Solemn,
rroral, and political obligations, must at
w ays require Some (kill and addreSs. The
ftratagtm fallen oy in the present inflÂ«n'crffor the accomplifiiment of that object, de
monltraies equally a propensity to political
intrigue, and a readiness to facritice the
molt (acred and delicate considerations to
its attainment. The President of the Urti
ted States, for his past services, has long
and deservedly Ituod high in the confidence
and affections Â«f his fellow citizens ; an<]
he has likewise always heretofore been
rmderltood to harmonize fully with his
Comitrymen in their fympatlietic attach
ment to the French nation struggling in
the cause of Liberty and Republican go
vernment. To expose to view any jnif
imderftanding iri the discharge of theij
rcfpeCtive duties between him and the
French minister, was an expedient wel,
calculated to produce the desired effect :
lior can any situation be conceived more
likely to prove injurious to tlie charaCtei
of that illustrious patriot, or distressing tt
his fellow citizens, than one which would
compel them to decide between their at
tachment to him, and their obligations tt
France, as well as their veneration for tlit
great principles of liberty, upon which hei
revolution is founded.
That the true and genuine objeCi of thi
publication has been to separate us fron
France, and to bring about a more intimate
connsftion with Britain, in violation of
public faith, and in contempt of other the
molt sacred obligations among men, anc
that the popularity of the President, iipoi
the idea of the ftippofed variance, has beer
ciught at as a precious means for its ac
complifhnient, are truths too obvious tc
efcap<* the attention of the inoft fuperfic a
observer.âWhy otherwise submit the l'ub
jeCt to the public view? Were the authors oi
the publication called on, for that purpose
by any obligations of official duty ? Anc
that a train has been laid, diilemiuatirtg the
variance and extending it to the communitj
at large, is with equal certainty to be in
ferred. How account upon the fame sub
jeCt, ajid at the fame time, for the prompl
and correspondent publication at Richmont
and Burlington, if they were wot dictated
or atlealt suggested. from the fame source.
Are these citizens, o are any of them, more
zealous than the reft of their countrymen,
for the public honor and national prospe
rity ? Have tbey exhibited, however re
fpcCtable their merits, and which Jl an:
willing in some inltances to acknowledge,
in the course of <.he late revolution, or al
any subsequent period, more fijnal proof;
of a disinterested patriotism, and undevi
ating attachment to the equal rights ol
mankind, that they fliould thus step for
ward, as an example to their fellow citi
zens, to foment this unhappy division ?
Might we not rather have expected, in
"harmony with the general sentiment, thai
they would have kept aloof, and as impar
tial but affliCVed speCtators, deplored the
occasion which gave birth to it! Might we
not at least have expected from them fame
declaration expressive of their approbation
of the principles of the French revolution,
and of gratitude for the services rendered
Us by that illustrious nation ?
That some misapprehension may have
dictated the proceedings at Richmond, I
am willing to allow ; but they have gone
f jrward undÂ«r a respeCtable patronage,and
if they have any objeCl in view, are intend
ed to announce abroad and influence at
home, the sentiment of this country. If
theft the good people ofthis common wealth
do not harmonize with the fentiraents con
tained in those proceedings, let them
<le-:lare it to the world themselves ! let
them make known ill unequivocal terms,
that they are firm and decided friends ta
the great principles of the French revolu
tion ; that they arc still grateful for the
important services rendered us by that
magnanimous nation, and consider their
eftablilhment of a republican government,
as an additional bond of union between
the two countries ; and whatever may be
the consequences, that they will never vi
olate their faith pledged to an ally of ex
alted merit, but on the contrary will spurn
with abhorrence every effort,however art
fully covered, that maybe made to produce
that pernicious effect. That they revere
the government under which they live,
and will at all times support those who till
its different departments in the discharge
of their conflitutional duties* Declara
tions like these, being founded on the im
mutable bads of justice and of truth, will
redound to their credit abroad, and mull
promote their national prosperity !

[Extra Els from late French papcrs.~\
I. IN erery deinocratidal government
the laws oÂ»ght to destroy, and prevent too
great an inequality of condition among the
citizens. Otherwise, an equality of con
flitutional rights will be a mere chimera :
the poor man will fell himfelf to the rich,
will become his slave, and deyoted to all
his views. Laws, favourable to universal
equality, ought nevertheless to be introduc
ed without commotion, or violence, and
without offending against that respeCt due
to the firft of all social rights, propriety.
If poflible, it ought to be done with an eye
to the happinefi; as well as the virtue of the
citizens. An equal division of landed pro
perty to every citizen, which ha* been pro
posed by some, is a project the molt fatal
that could be mentioned ; it would be un
just, useless, and sanguinary; tf'jujJ, be
cause to carry it into efteft. many persons
luuft be deprived of their lawful property ;
ujelcfs, betaufe the very day alter the <li
vilion took place idleness, luxury and ex
travagance would take poil'efiion of thou
sands ; an immediate sale of property
would ensue, and consequently inequality
of wealth again take place; fangtunary,
because it is certain the citizens would get
into quarrels, and cut each others throats
before the partition was half finilhed. Add
to this, that all ind-uftry would cease, and
in a little time thousands would perilh oi
famine and misery.âThere are other mea
(ures to be taken to answer the proposed
end, more practicable, and much less dan
gerous : not to mention the (haring estates
among children equally, on which opinions
are muah divided, I shall bring into view
two of the leading measures to be adopted.
The firft is, To abolijli all JuceeJji-Ji to
property in an; iniirett line of dejient.
Whatever may be bequeathed to the Re
public, and whatever the bequelts may be,
let them be diftribnted once a year, ai a
gift, to young people in every diftritt, -who
(hall have the belt reputation for industry
ind honelty. Such a measure will tend to
prevent the re-uniting of great estates, and
their accumulation into great mafl'es of
wealth. In making a divilion of ellates,
it will contribute tothe relief of poor fa
milies, and will inspire the youth of both
>xes with a generous emulation to out do
sach other iu the duties of labour and
jenevolence. There is certainly no'hing
unjust in such a procedure : A man, during
tiis life, can make ul'e of his property as
tie pleases. It is nothing more than right.
But, that his rights (while living) and Will,
[hould have any force after his death ; that
\ man, who exists 110 longer, (hould have
the disposal of the good things of this
world, is what the social compact never
'ranted, although, through the prejudices
if mankind, it has hitherto been per>mt,ed.
The rights and the duties of man are radi
ally derived from the necelfities of the
pecies. A man then, after liis decease,
laving no longer any wants, cannot pofE
sly have any rights. His whole propers)
KUurally becomes the common .propert)
>f all men ; and in consequence of th'n
latural right, the Republic becomes the
leir.
It is true, from this principle it results,
hat children themselves cannot heir tfit
loffeflions of their predeceffbrs, but by con
ent of the state. But there is no cause tc
ipprehend a ftrifl: application of this prin
ciple, or any abuse of it, as theoretically
aid down. The Republic of France will
>n!y so far make use of it, as to secure a
roice in regulating paternal bequests, anti
>reventing the ralh injultice of capricious
Tien to their offspring; but it is by no
neans her intention to take away from
jarents the right of conveying their pro
>ertÂ» to their children. The intimate re
f.tion that exilb between a foil and his fa
:her, and the neceiiity of obligating the pa
rents to inereafe their estates, and of in
iucing children to aflift their parents, not
:o mention the great inconveniences that
would result in a great empire, from an
equal divilion of property, render it cer
tain that '-onr laws will never eltablilh or
permit any such equality, eveÃ fliould they
sboitih'nll claim of fuccellion to eltates in a
:Â©llateral i(iitdireft) line.
Thefecond meal tire, that would greatly
rontribute to a political equality would be,
:o exempt every citizen from all taxation
whatever, of the indispensable necelfaries
~>f life, and to draw a nett revenue from
he remainder only. Both humanity and
equity forbid that import laws (hould ope
-ate to the ruin or indigence of any citizen,
Dy claiming a (hare of what is absolutely
leceflary to hisexiftence, while they leave
Jthers free to riot in luxury and extrava
gance. Would it not be glaring injultice
:o tax a citizen for poffeflirg an article of
iropetty without which he would perilh ot
lunger or cold? The facrifice of his iiulif
lenfable property, or of his life, is the duty
}f no citizen, unless solely when the public
afety is at (take. In any other cafe, his
irft right is, To live, and his firft duty,
:o take care of himfelf. At Athens, taxa
tion was chiefly imposed on fuperfluities,
[till less on the ufeful things, and not r:
ill upon the indispensable neceflariesoflife.
At Rome, over and above citizens destitute
of property, who paid no taxes, the Re
public also exempted the poor holders of
["mall properties, and did not require a tax
in money. The reafen was, it being
thought that they paid their (hare of fer
cice tothe Republic in begetting and bring
ng up, by dint of their labour, robust citi
zens, to be the strength and defenders of
:he community. If once the meai'ures here
hinted at were adopted, if the mod com
mon necell'aries of life were freed from
tax, and all taxes whatever collefled from
the rich and voluptuous, from fuperfluities
and the artificial necelfaries of life ; we
(hould then fee taxation the cause of little
or 110 evil, and vartly Sefs of inequality
among citizens than at present.
11. Of bigots, and bigotry in patriotism.
'' There are bigots in politics and patri
otism as well as in religion, and they are
commonly known by the fame tokens.
That is, little exterior ceremonies are sub
ftituted for the genuine virtues of the heart,
and the true adoration of the foal. Words
are ptrt in theplacr of deeds; with an ap
parent severity in judging of others, and a
fpicit of jealousy ami intolerance. These
are the usual leading marks of both del"
criptions of hypocrites. Our political bi
gots are particularly studious to wear a
(month, black foretop (expreflive of the
real character of their fouls); with an ana
thema ready to be fulminated against ever)
one who has a powdered head, or win
carries a tri-coloured cockade in his hat
instead of a white one. These are morta
tins. The word Republican is imprefTee
upon the cockades of our revolutionar;
hypocrites, on the buttons of their coat*
in the very lids of their fnuff-boxes ! Ir

Like devotees in general, they are anxiou:

whole lives are palfed in denunciations,
In their own fe&ions, and departments
they are constantly seen at the bar of ac

CONSIDERING it the duty of U,e peo
ple of this diftriÂ£t, to declare their
principles and opinions on fubjefts which
at present agitate the public mind, a re
fpe&able humber having met for that pur
poseâAlexander St. Clair in the chair ;
A. Stuart proposed, as the fenfr of the
present meeting,the following Resolutions,
which after a full difcuflion, xvere Unani
mously agreed toâ
1. Resolved, that all attempts to Cub vert
the federal government,or violate its prin
ciples, ought to be firmly and vigorously
refilled.
2. Resolved, that it is the interest of A
merica to cultivate peace and harmony
with all the world, b;. just and honourable
means, and that our executive authority
ought to be supported iÂ« the exercise of its
conttitutional power, for enforcing the
laws and securing to us this great objett.
3. Resolved, that the parriotifm, wif
doin, and tried virtue of the President of
the U.States entitle him to the highest confi
dence as well as lalling gratitude of his
country, to whose present peace, liberrj
and happiness he has fu greatly contri
buted.
4. Resolved, that we entertain the high
est refpefl which gratitude can inspire, for
the generous and important fervises of the
French nation, during the American revo*
lution K and that we feel the ftrongelt at
tachments to those principles which have
given birth io a finnlar one in that coun
try.
5. Resolved, that any attempts to dis
unite France and America, ought to be rt -
probated as dangerous to Repblicanifm in
both councries, and paving ihe way to a
connection with monarchical govern
ments.
6. Resolved, finally, that we are attach
ed to our own fcovermnent âthat we are
attached to the Preiidentâthat we are at
tached to peace,To long as it can be main
tained upon honorable termsâ that we are
attached to the French nation, and the
principles of their revolutionâthat we
hate monarchy, and more intimate con
nexions with it, as the worst of evilsâ
and that we mod ardently defile that the
imprudence and indiscretion of a servant
ofFrance on the one hand, oran ill-judged
interference of our ovvu citizens (not in
the executive department) on the other,
may not difnnite two nations, who have
embraced the lame principles of freedom,
and who we believe eiteem each other
must ardently.

PHILADELPHIA.
JVednesday, September 18.
The fliip Manchester, from Liverpool,
bound to this port, run on ihui e on Tuef
da? night the nth inft. at Turtle Gut in
let, about 6 miles N. E. of Cape May. She
was going at the l ate of 8 knots an hour
when Ihe (truck. It is expefled Ihe wilj
be got off. Part of her cargo is arrived
here.
The Comniiflioners who set out from
Philadelphia the last of April, to hold a
treaty, for the purpose of'making peace
with the Western Indians, have returned
without success. Timothy Pickering, Efcj.
arrived in this cit} lad Friday, and Mr.
Randolph has since reached Germantown.
They came back, by the way of Genefee,
Albany and New-York. General Lincoln
:00k another route, and on account of the
icknefs prevalent in this city, will proba
bly return direQly to his home in Maffa
:hufett3.
We understand that the hoflili Indians
efufed to make peace, unless the United
states would remove all our fettlcrs (a
nountingto several thoufand-s) from over
:hÂ« Ohio, and make that river the bounda
ry between Uem. This was obviously in-
Klmifljble.
The Governor of New-York has, by
iroclamation, ordered all vessels coming
roci Philadelphia to that port, or any other
>ort in the Hate, to perferma quarantine ;
o continue till such time as legally dis
charged therefrom. No vessel is to ap
proach nearer than within e miles of the
city of New-York, till vilited by the in-
I'peaing phylicians and health officers of
the port.
We hear that the citizens of Cheftertown
(Maryland) have entered into resolutions
tor preventing the flages from this city
palling through, 011 their way to Baltimore.
The flages to New-York by way of Bur
lington and Bordenton have been flopped
some time. Indeed, we hear any person
travelling on those roads from Philadel
phia, though in ever so found a state of
health, is shunned like a pestilence, and
viewed with the fame eye ot horror, as if
lie was bc-aiing with him all ths evils of
Pandora's box, to distress and desolate
mankind.
Amidst the present diftrefles here, we
remark with pleasure. that a more healthy
season than the present has never been
known in New-York.
Extract of letter from Lett don dated July
1793, to a friend here.
"In such eiteem is Charles Fox held

merit and virtue as the Britilh nation."
ExtraCt of a letter from Baltimore, Sept. 12.
"One of the marks by which the clo
ven hoof of toryism and Britilh influence
may be known, is the almost unanimous
praotice'of addreflers in favor of neutrality,
tÂ© include a volley of abuse against the citi
zen minifler of France. The defignof many
of these people is to raise an indignation in
the public mind against the reprefentame
of our ally, who, doubtless, expefled the
American government the fame view
ofthe 22d. article of the treaty that he
and the present French government have,
winch might have ltd him into a line of
conduct, lor which he has been so much
â¢ allied. Some people pietuid that amighty favour it granted the French in
felling their prizes in our ports, which is ai
the fame time extended to the felling ol
the prizes of all their enemies. I only
further observe that I know it is under-
Hood by manyAoiericans, to be the obvious
meaning of the 22d article ot the tieatv
with France, that they Ihould enjoy a right
apparently contained therein ; and especi
ally, as the cause 'which the French are
engaged ill, is to the iirtereft of mankind in
general (though many cauiKit and many
-will not fee it) and as America herfelf is
bow reaping the advantages of a well elta
blilhed government, obtained with the aj
fljtanee receivedfvom the French, are rea
sons fnfficient for countenancing of them
jnore than has been done. But however
men now differ in their conllruaions ol
that article, the time may come, when
many will with that they had viewed it in
a different light, and when, by their pre
sent political manoeuvring, they may cm
off the only resource that could bave been
obtained. National judgments are on cer
tain nccafions much Complained of; but
â¢we ought to remember that national in
gratitude may not improbably be the cause.

" IT Is inherent in the nature of fove

general sense and the genera! practice oi
nankind, and the exemption, as one of tht
it*tributes of sovereignty, is how efijoycii
jy the government of every State in the
Union. Unlcfs, therefore, there is a fur -
ender of this immunity in the plan of tfie
Convention, it will remain with the States
md the danger intimated must be merel)
deal. The circumstances which are ne
eflary to produce an alienation of State
sovereignty, were difcufied in conlidering
the article of taxation, and need not be
repeated here. A recurrence to the prin
ciples then eftiibliflied will fatisfy 11s, that
there is no colour to preteail that the state
governments, would by the adoption of that
plan be diverted of the privilege of paying
their own debts in their own way, free from
every constraint but that which flows from
the obligations of good faith. The con
uuets UiweeiJ a aÂ»uÂ«n spri individuals at c
only binding on the conscience of the fove*
reign, and have no pretensions to a com
pulsive force ; they confer no right of acÂ»
tion independent of the sovereign will.
To what purpose would it be to authorise
suits against states, for the debts they owl ?
liow could recoveries be enforced ? it is
evident that it could Hot be done without
waging war against the contriving state ;
snd to al'cribe to the federal courts, by
mere implication, and in deftruftion of a
pre-existing right of the state governments,
a power which would involve such a con
ference, would be altogether forced and

ELEGY
On the heath of a Blacksmith.
WITH the nerves of a Sampson this son
of the fledge,
By the ativil his livelihood got;
With the (kill of old Vulcan could tem
per an edge ;
And ftruckâw,hile his iron was hot.
By forging he liv'd. yet never was tried,
Or condemn'd by the laws of the land ; '
But still it is certain, and can't be denied,
Ha often \vas Burnt iii the hand.
With the fonsof St. Crifpih no kindred
he claim'd,
Wiih the I ast he had nothing to do ;
He handled no awl, and yet in his time
Vlade many an excellent j' t oe.
He blew up no coals of sedition, but ftilj
His bellows was always in blafl ;
And I will acknowledge (deny it who
will) â¢
That one and but ewe, he poflefs'd.
No after was he, or coincern'd witlj the
rtage,
No audience toaive him appear'd ;
Yet oft in his (hop (like a crowd in a rage) 1
The voice of a h'Jfing was heard.
Th6'y? eeling of axes was part of his cares,
[n thieving he never was found ;
And tho' he was c6f.ftantly beating oil
bars,
No veilel he e'er ran aground.
Alas and alack ! and what more can I fay
Of Vulcan's unfortunate son â
The priest and the foKton have bore him
away,
And the fotind t>f his hammer is done 1

âA. Sometimes I did ; but not always.

moment when I began to fufpeft his con
duit, I was put under arrest. I ever hop
ed that he had been forced to act as he
did, and I had no means of doing any
thing.
Did you not fuffer your agents tc
flatter you with the idea of royalty or
didtatorfhip ?âA. All those who knew
ine, knew also my way of thinking, and
that I should have elteemed it an insult.
Q. Why are you so ill with the persons
of your family who call ihemfelves Patri
ots ?âA. I know no person of my family
who call themselves patriots, with whom
I am ill.

m Paris, or in the country, having fixed
my principal residence at my eilate of la
Lande, fix leagues from Paris.
What part did you take 111 the re
solution of 1789? A. I left Paris the
1 ,>th of July 1789, not having a place tu
elt my head, without being menaced by
illaflination or poison ; as soon as I could
find that my life and liberty were in fafety,
I returned voluntarily, and with eagernefi
:o my country, on the second of Aptil,
1790, after having previously sent my oath,
which I confirmed and signed again at my
FtAion on the day following. Since my
return to I'ranee, I have meddled wjti
lothing, have led a very retired life, goinjj
bmetimes to places of public amusement
and having remained at my country seal
it Landau, with a very few servants, with
Jut sleeping out of it, since the nth ol
fuly, 1792, till the Bth of April, 1793
the day when I was arretted and sent tc
:he Abbey prison at Paris, from whenÂ«e 1
A'as taken out the next night, to the fori
if Notre Dame de la Garde, at Marfeil
es, where I am imprisoned, without be
ng permitted to fee any one without wit
lefTes, although the decree of the Conven
:ion, article 3, which orders the interro
jation of the family of the Bourbons, in
:erdi&s all communication, only with tilt
ndividuals of that family. I gave a htm
ired and fifty thousand livres as a patri
Dtic donation : I gave in 1792, for th<
svar, feventy-lix horses, forty two of whicf
ivere equipped : I made presents to tin
volunteers, who set out from all the placei
in the vicinity of my residence ] havi
paid cxafily all my taxes : I have giver
money to my feftion for the poor, fevera
times, and lately for the recruiting service
I took the oath of the 15th of Augull
1792, to maintain liberty and equality
2nd to die in iheir defence; I claim mj
liberty since I am guilty of nothing, finci
I have not defeived to lose it, and finkinj
under infirmities, fuffer too much in mi
prison.
Q-_ Did the ci-devant princes, your re
ations, who have emigrated, never writi
o you, to engage you to emigrate, an<
3ear arms againit your country ? A. j
lever heard from them since my return t<
Franee on the 2d of April, 1790, and the]
vould have solicited me in vain ; I Ihouk
lever have consented.
Were you never present at thofi
jrivate meetings, then known by the Au
Irian committee, where the counter-revo
ution was preparing ? A. Never.
Did you never conceive the projefl
sf favouring the flight of the ci-devani
ting? A. Never; I had no knowledgf
>1 his departure, till the day following th<
nighc of his flight, when the nationa
guards came to take me in my house anc
condua 'me to the Section. I ever took
particular care since my return to France
to avoid ail opportunities of speaking ir
private to the ci-devant king, and alwav:
answered him aloud, whenever he addrefled
himfelf to me, in ordtr to remove from me
suspicions I did not deserve.
For what reason did the nationa
guards on the day following the flight o
the ci-devant king, come to your house tc
condua you to your fettion ? A. I believ.
they took it upon themfelvcs ; they made
known no order to me, and after having
appeared at my feflion, I was sent bacfc
Â«ry quietly, and have remained free eve:
"nice.
Q. Had you no intimation of the pro
efts of Louis Capet of ordering the troopi
o fire on the people 011 the 20th of Au
just ? A. I was only apprised of it bj
he journals at my ellate at la Lande,
A'here I had been 1 ith of July,
preceding.
Q What was your opinion concerning
:he abolition of royalty, and the eftablifh
nent of the Republic one and indivisible ;
A. The most entire submission to the de
crees of the National Convention.
Did you endeavour, by intrigues, to
prevent the judgment of Louis Capet > I
repeat that I never meddled with any
thing.
Q. Why did you interfere with no
thing j was it from a sentiment of hatred
for the revolution, or through indifference:
A. It was not from a sentiment of hatred,
for the revolution, but because being born
without any other ambition than that ol
living peaceably in my own house (which
my condua at all times proved, even before
the revolution) I never did, nor do, now
form any other with than to end my days
peaceably In the bosom of my cauntry, in
the midst of my fellow-citizens, and to
deferv*, by my conduct, their fuffrage and
elleem.
It appears to me, that a (late so per
fectly null, does not accord with the fuff
rage and elleem of which you are desirous.
Did you never hear and tolerate counter
revolutionary expreltions from your do
mestics ? A. So far from tolerating them,
I ever declared, that I would immediately
discharge.those who fnould dare to make
use of them.
If you ware so cautious in fpcaking
to a ci-dÂ«vant king, wny did you seek fucli
frequent opportunities of speaking to him:
A. I did not seek opportunities of fpeak
to him, I only answered him.
Why did you visit him so often 1
A. I was fometimc3 a fortnight without
visiting him (which happened very often]
and being his relation, I thought it incum
bent oil me to pay my duty to him.
