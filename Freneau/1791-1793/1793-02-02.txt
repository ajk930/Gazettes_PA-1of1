IN your Mail of the 29th of October lad.
[See National Garotte, No. 113 .]! wa
furprifedto find a publication, evidently
proceeding from Mr. Clymer's pen, i:
which, among many improper things, it
contained an assertion with respect to me
not less unprovoked than untrue. I cer
tainly should avoid thus noticing the Tub
ject, were it not that the public are, it:
fotne degree, intereited in the conduit of
every officer ; and th. several of mj
friends are folicitousfor an explanation o!
the charge bro't againd me I shall, how
ever, confine myfelf entirely to that ex
planation, without attempting either t<
ridicule or to fatyrize the proceedings o:
the fuperviforâwtiofe own reflexion inu(
fugged, that in the choice between
fahhood and a misrepresentation, a mail oi
spirit will be indifferent.
Mr. Clymcr has asserted."that I evprejs
ly gave asone for declining to take
the depofitionsof witnesses pointed out tc
roe i,i the cafe of a riot, the odium to bÂ«
incurred by it." Lead I (hould be sus
pected of imitating Mr. Clymer, I (hallnoi
trull r<Â» nv . 1. >;it of rÂ»w> i .
exhibit, to those who choose to examine
it, the condnÂ£t itfelf. Mr. Clytner al
ludes to a correspondence between hiir
and me, which I requed you will publift
annexed to this letter. To those who
/hall take the trouble of reading this cor
respondence, it is not neceirary to remark,
that I considered Mr. Clymer's application
to me as, at leuft. indelicate: that I difbe
lieved and denied the danger to his person,
which he fuggelted ; but arguing on the
supposition of its reality, as with him it
Was fair to do, I thence inferred that hij
butinefs mult be odious, and in this hypo
thetical and not express manner, I gave
tfii; odium as a reason ; not why I decli
ned to take those depositions, but why it
was-indeeent in him to alk me to doit. I
gave him other reason; for declining it.
There is another assertion in Mr. Cly
mer's publication, which involving in it
the character of public justice in Pennfyl
yania, I consider in a far more feriotis
light. He ought to have so viewed it, and
taken good heed that he knew what he
was faying. If he knows any facts to
support his assertions, " that the feint ani
madversions of the State Courts in this
country upon offences committed again ft
the laws of the United States, have afford -
ed real encouragement to them " his own
reputation, either for truth or discretion.
requires that he disclose them. I ought
to know, at lead, as well as he, and I
know none, and deny that any exid. Im
prudence or a worse motive mud have
dictated this assertion. But in my letter,
Mr. Clymer, vvhofe senses were remarka
bly (harpened by every thing that happen
ed to him here, had discerned a battery
raised against the United States, and he
perhaps thought, that in Philadelphia he
might fafely ereÂ£t a counter fortification.
The assertion might be believed long e
nough to serve as a fufficient pretence for
a vigorous exertion of the authority oi
the federal courts; andeven whendeteÂ£t
ed, might charitably be considered as a
pious fraud to advance the political hie
rarchy, and contribute to the desirable end
y t)f sublimating all authority in the arm oi
the Union.
If those who have read Mr. Clymer':
publication {hould also take the troubled
reading this and the following letters, 1
hope it will be thought, that I have not
I'afhly depped into public examination
nor extended it to unreasonable bounds.
I entered upon it with relu&ance, and now
drop it entirely.
I am, Sir,
Your very humble servant,
ALEX. ADDISON.

lavoe that will probably take place in
:he file of hi elf 'e, through the scarcity
as money in the part of the country where
he resides, will be apt to reduce hiin and
his family to total def: rudion and ruin.
I acknowledge, that there i:- a section in
this excise ast, which seems to hold forth
a method of relief to a person again!!
whom a rigorotr. recovery of a penalty
has been had in virtue of this ast: which
ir to be by a petition exhibited to a cfilirifl
judge, which i afterwards by him to be
transmitted together with the depofitiom
of lasts thereto annexed, to the fecretarj
of the treafiiry ; who is authorized there
upon to mitigate or remit such forfei
ture, if he thinks proper. But I look up
on this feition to have been thrown inec
the body of this ast, with scarcely any o
ther delign, than by wav of palliation, tc
wear the appearance of foftening the ri
gour of it without giving any certain ot
effectual remedy againit the oppression oj

of much trouble and espence, that mull
necessarily attend the mode of procedure
thereby pointed out ; which may in forr.t
cases amount nearly to the value of the!
film forfeited, whether the petitioner suc
ceeds in his application or not. âI con
ceive that any further observations on this
head, ar? unnecefl'ary to convince every
person of common sense, of the wauto;-
nest, cruelty and opprsffion of this excise
act.
-In the next place I observe, that the
mode of the tax imposed by this ast, as far
as itrefpefts the spirits diflilled from ma
terials produced from the orchards anei
farms of the citizens of the United States.
is unnece[fary, un/atisfatiory, and odious.
to the individuals on whom it is to fall.
Very little is necelfary to be said in ordei
to prove, that the mode of this tax is un
fa isfaftory and odious to the people of the
United States in general, and especially to
those who live in the interior and frontier
parts of the country.
When a great, generous, and enlighten
ed people have waded through such scenes
of blood and distress, as the citizens of the
American dates have done, and have in
to. feqiience of their perseverance and va
lor, acquired a perfect freedom, andeltab
!i-'hed their independence and sovereignty;
Mmething is certainly due to their f.â¢ nti

difcover'd that an implicit reliance on any
man is to give an anodyne to N libertyâ
I pretend not to divinationâbut if I may
be allowed to reason from what I know,
and predict from what has come within
my own knowledge, there will be a mon
strous revolution in the opinions of the
people of this countryâMy friends anil

when men change their conduct (and it is

a warm argument with a friend of mine
who is extremely zealous in his republi
ii >r nciples ; I contended, forthefake
of argument, that we had nothing to fear
from any one man among us ; that tho'
i inie of the officers of government had de
\ iated from the true principles and prac
tices of republicanism, they could have no
delign upon the liberties of the .people, but
that they were under the influence of a
â vat lily, which sober reflection might do
away j that tho'attempts had been made,
and werellill making,to Introduce distinc
tions among us, and make equality less
common, the bafenefa of such attempts
would for.n be discovered, and would
bring contempt, and perhaps infamy upon
the authors ; that the freemen of Ameri
ca understood their rights, and the dignity
of their tharafler too well to furreiider
them for the gratification of the ambition
of any man, however well he may havd
deferred of his country: thatâMy friend
could bear with me no longerâ"Zounds!
exclaimed he, who would have supposed
that Cromwell ever had it in contempla
tion to raise himfelf to kingly authority, or
that the republicans of that day would
have ever bowed their necks to his ambiti
on ? Trace his conduct from his firft ap
pearance on the flage of nation to his as
sumption of the proteftorfhip, and what
does it exhibit but republican profeflioii
tophi (Heated with religious & moral cant;
and after having made himfelf the idol of
the people by pretending to be their friend,
what did he do ? He endeavoured to be
come a kingâl tellyou. and I can prove
it by the teltimony of all ages, that it is
dangerous in the extreme to set up any
man as an idol, to suppose that he alone is
capable of dispensing the blessings of liber
ty ; to proflrate your entire confidence,
and fecmity before him ; to hail him as
your political saviour ; for however defer
ring he may be, there is a magic w power
which assimilate: everything to itfelf,&the
more implicit your confidence, the more
easily will you become dupes to his viewsâ
Cail to mind t.lio ostracism of the Greeks ;
so jealous were they of their freedom,
that they thought it insecure to'retain any
man among them, who had it in his pow
er to command the entirewill of the peo
ple, left he might turn it to their ruin, and
vet you think yourselves wiser than all the
world, and are willing to commit your
, most sacred treasure into the hinds of one
man, without other security than that for

every man for his virtues, but I idolize
â oman; it is beneath the dignity of free
men, ami I lincerely hope, that slavery will
be his portion, w ho bows down before any

friend's declaration startled me, for I had
never before heard him express himfelf
with so much fire, and as I wiflied not to
inflame him further, 1 put an end to the
| argumentâYonfee, Sir, that even mode

its eyerâl hope the Prefideut, who ' Â»
hitherto had the warmest aftedtions of h's
fellow citizens (the great eft diftindinn
that he could receive) will be no longer

A FARMER.
Bucks County, Jan, 29,1793.foreign intelligence.
LONDON, Nov. 2â20.
The trial of Mr. Thomas Paine is ex
pected with more than usual eagernels by
the public : nothing, can be more interelt
iujr to Engliftimen than to know whether
opinion is free, or not, upon general lnb
jects of politics, for such is precisely the
question to be tried.
Every poflible attempt has been made to
seduce Mr. Erlkine from Handing forth
Mr. P.line's client. Thus, are there found
i 1 the kingdom men base enough to at
tempt debauching the honor and intereli oi
tie Britilh bar. It is almost needless tc
fiy that every endeavour of this kind had
n > effefl upon Mr. Erftiiw. The light will
be oild enoughâa distinguished member oi
the French National Convention to be tri
ed at the Fngiilh bar, for afierting thÂ£
Kights of Man !
Several accounts mention the failing oi
the French fleet from Toulon. Ihe at
tack of Civita Vecchia and Rome seem:
decided on. The men of Marseilles are
also proj-Cting an expedition to Loretto, 2
city 011 the eastern lide of Italy, where is
the d:poJit of riches in the Holy Houte for
merly brought from Bethlehem 011 angels
back*. The holy chert will probably lur
nitli the French with the greatell quantity
of rich plunder, of any place in the world.
It is foinewhat wonderful, that in the ma
ny wars of Europe, none of the privateer:
of any nation have ever attempted topil
-1 ige it. Ab the reign of superstition is now
on the decline; it will hardly befofafein
future.
A learned Profcflor in France, who has
for a long time employed himfelf in ma
king refearohes into the comparative ana
tomy of the brain, has publilhed one great
discovery, relative to the influence of the
ftrnCture of the brain on the intellectual fa
culties. He has found the brain, from the
most accurate iuveftigation, to coniilt of a
vast number of Inmi'itr, or thin ihe lis, 11 -
milar to the coats of an onion. These, in
some persons, he has found to amount to
the number of 7So. In others, they may
poifibly amount to more. In the brain oi
an ideot which he difleCted, were found
110 more than 324, and in a dumb perlon
only 362. He therefore. with"great rea
son, foppofes, that the intellectual powers
of inan are proportionate to the number oi
these lamina, or thin coats of the brain.
It would have been curious to have difTec
ted such a brain as that ol Newton : the
lamina would probably have exceeded
j 000.
From the experience of ages, we may
consider the clergy of all religions as a body
of men who have separate interests and
views, dirtinet from thole of the reft oi
mankind. The most despotic monarch:
exercise no jurisdiCtion but over the bodie:
and goods of men ; but all the clergy, from
the great Lama of Thibet to his Holinef:
at Rome, and the Archbishop of Canterbu
ry, at London, aspire to despotism over the
mind ; a despotism which is the more dan
gerous, as when once it is eftabliihed, it
extends to every thing else. The body
and goods are no better than rags ; those
gentlemen are the sole disposers of our sal
vation, and what will mankind not
obtain it ? This has been fufficiently evin
ced during seven or eight centuries of the
reign of the clergv and of ignorance. A:
to kings, their influence, origin, and con -
sequence among mankind, may be aptl)
depicted in the following apologue : Once
upon a time the horse called man in to his
aififtance agiinft the stag; the man got on
his back, aflifted him, fnbdued him, and re
mained his master. Thus did men call in
kings to aflift them against each other.â
Horses are still, luckily, ignorant of their
own strength, as well as subjeCts of their
natural rights : if they did but know them,
how many riders would be thrown, and
how many kings dethroned ! Some re
mains of ignorance in these matters are
perhaps an advantage.
Soon after the conclusion of Lord
North's administration, Mr Edmund
Burke became himfelf a pensioner in clif
guifc ; in the fame manner as if a pension
had been granted in the name of John
Nokes, to be privately paid to and enjoy
ed by Tom Stiles The name of Edmund
J3urke does not appear in the original tran
saction, but after the peniion was obtained,
Mr. Burke wanted to make the most of it
at once by felling or mortgaging it; and
the gentleman in whose name the peniion
stands, applied to one of the public officers
for that purpose. This unfortunately
brought forth the nameof Edmund Burke,
as the real pensioner of 15001. per annum !
When men trumpet forth the bleifings oi
the English conititution. it ought to be
known w hat fort of blessings they allude
to.
Mr. Boudinot's Speech in the House oi
Representatives, on Monday, January 14;
the house being in committee of the
whole, on the petition of the officers &c.
of the late continental army, for furthei
compenfat-on.
Mr. Boudinot allured the committee,
that he had determined not to trouble them
on this flibjeft, and he fliolild have carried
chat determination into execution, did he
aot find that the question was likely to be
taken in a manner not altogether plealing
to him. He had expe&ed that the claims
of the officers would have been fairly met,
and if decided in the negative, tliofe gen
tlemen would have gone away fully fatis
tied that their claims had received a fair
and candid difcurtion : But he feared, from
the arguments of gentlemen, that the idea
that the United nates had unjustly failed
in performing the contrail with the army,
would take place, and an ungrounded im
putation of partiality, (at lealt in the minds
of the petitioners) would be left on the
government, when, Mr. B. thought, t
lair iiatement of the matter would un
doubtedly put a very different face on the
whole business. The officers of the arm)
had come forward as creditors of the Uni
ted States in a decent and becoming man
aer, and presented their claims founded or
'ormer contracts, which they conceivcd hai
lot been fulfilled, and therefore they callet
an government to do what was right anc
lift; on the occasion. Congress were the
independent representatives of the wholt
anion, to whom every citizen ought tohavt
free access. and where every Citizen wa:
to be considered as equally entitled to ai
mpartial hearing. It on examination i
Ihould appear that juftite required a far
:her competition to the petitioners as i
:lafs of public creditors, when considered 01
1 general scale, 110 man in the house wouk
De more ready tlrin himfelf to give his voice
"or such a measure. But if it should ap
tiear that the contrast 011 the public hac
iieen complied with, as far as diflributive
uftice would permit, he vvifhed the petiti
oners to be convinced of it, and that thoft
losses they had met with, were such as hat
seen equally borne by other creditors of the
union, and therefore a general burthen, b)
which he hoped they would receive full fa
tisfaction on this ftibjeft.
Mr. Bouelinot, while he acknowledgec
:he patriotil'm and virtue of the American
irmy, and fubferibed fully to their eminent
ervices and patient futferings, he could not
join in decrying the eliential services anei
"ufierings of the other public creditors ol
:lie Uniteel States, who in the day of their
liltrefs, had administered their property, tc
:he support ot that army and the defence
jf the union. Ail public creditors who
jrefented themselves in the day of diflrefs
:o the relief of the union, were equally en
titled to the attention of Congress ; but
:he officers in their memorials liad applied
111 behalf of the army alone, he wiflied to
conlieler their cafe, in the firft instance, ab
lfraÂ£tly, without connecting it with any o
ther class of creelitors, and then compare it
with others of their fellow-citizens.
He undertook, therefore, in the firfl
ulace, to slate the public conduct towards
the army from the beginning to the com
mencement of thp present government â
He would then examine the conduct of the
present government, and lafHy, supposing
their claim just, enquire into the praftica
oility of it.
The committee were well acquainted
with the rife and progress of the late war.
At the firft alarm, the patriotic citizens of
the colonies flew to their arms and formed
in the field, without terms or stipulations as
to their services. In 17-5, Congrefj turned
their attention to the army as the firlt great
abject, and having organized it, fixed the
pay at the rate of 50 dollars for a colonel,
and 20 dollars for a captain. In 1776, de
lirous of encouraging citizens who were so
zealous in their country's service, they gave
a bounty of 20 dollars to each private, a -
mounting in the whole, to upwards of
200,000 dollars, besides a promise of 100
acres of land, and to the officers at the rate
of 500 acres to a colonel, and the reft in pro
portion. In October of the fame year, de
irons of keeping up the zeal of the officers,
they increased the pay in proportion of 75
dollars to a colonel, and 40 dollars to a
captain, and gave a suit of cloaths per an
num to every private, or 20 dollars in cash.
111 Dec. 1777, Congress fliewed their desire
of encouraging the service, by giving a
month's extra pay to the army. The offi
cers, anxious for their future support after
the war was over, exprefl'ed an earnest de
lire of having forne provision of this fortan
ticipated, and Congress in compliance with
their desires, after a consideration of three
months or more, agreed in May 1778, to
give each officer half pay for 7 years after
the enel of the war, on condition that they
did not hold any office of profit under any
individual state, and 80 dollars to each pri
vate. In November following, they gave
to each fupernuinerary officer one year's
pay extraordinary, and increased the allow
ance for every retained ration, to 2s. 6d.
in money. The army, not being fatisfied
with this provision, in August 1.779, a com
mittee appointed for the purpose, reported
farther provision of half pay for life, with
out any condition in favour of those who
should continue till the end of the war, and
recommended to the states to provide for
widows of officers and foleliers who should
be killed in the service. Congress likewise
encreafed the allowance of monthly subsis
tence for officers to 500 dollars for a colo
nel, a captain 200 tlollars, and a private 10
dollars, and_added to all this, Congre/s al
lowed the officers to receive from the pub
lic stores, one hat, a watch coat, body coat.
four vests, four pair breeches, four shirts,
four itocks, fix pair stockings, four pair
(hoes, per annum, nearly at former price?,
and the folcliers in proportion. The half
pay for life was adopted, to the great of
fence of individual states, who sent forward
petitions againfl the measure as impolitic
and unjust. The war continuing, the dif-
Crell'es of the country increased, which re
duced the public credit so low, as to pro
duce great uneasiness among all clafles of
public creditors, both in the army and
country.
The gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.
Hartley) in his argument reprefente'd (ir
Mr. B's opinion)his own'feelings on the oc
calion,rather than a comparative view with
the fufierings of the citizens at large ; for it
is not uncommon, when gentlemen arc
connected with a particular class ef fuffer
ers, to view what they fee and hear as
an exclusive and peculiar evil, withoul
considering what pafles elsewhere. Thui
the soldier considers the facrifice of the ar
ny as the only intolerable burthen, while
he merchant, knowing his own loiles bell,
.onliders others' complaints 3s trifling as
uis ; and the farmer, who earns every far
thing by the fvveat of his brow, blames the
government for not giving him the firft place
in all their systems. Yet the fair cortclu
lion is, that the burthen has been generall)
nearly equal, and a common tax for the de
fence of our country âAnd altho' Mr. B.
readily fubfi ribed to the great fufterings and
patriotic exertions of the army, yet the)
should also give credit for the attention oi
their country, to the utinoll of their abili
ties. As the gentleman from Pennsylvania
is befl acquainted with the line of his owr
(fate, Mr. Boudinot undertook to mentior
what was done by Pennsylvania for he:
own officers in addition to the allowances
of CongreCs.âDuring the war, llores were
provided, from which they received a par
tial supply at the hard money prices. The
depreciation of their pay was fully made nj:
to them ; at the faies of tile confifcated es
tates their certificates were received as hard
money ; the fame for lands in the land-of
ficeâthe intereff of 6 per cent, was paid on
their certificates for a number of yearsâa::
additional bounty of land was given to them
ready surveyed and free from expence ;
and when the funding system took place,
they had their 3 cent, and deferrec
debt made good to 6 per cent, oy addition
al certificates from the state, which were
afterwards redeemed at about 50 and y,
per cent, in hard money.

nnHE present rulers of the United States
call peace, peace Iâbut there is no
peace. Peace reigns where jtiftice reigns ;
where this is not made the foundation of a
government and of laws, confufion mull
ensue.
Whatever were the nftenfib'e reasons for
adopting the present government of the U
nited States, there is no doubt but that it
owed its existence to the influence and ar
tifices of a few men, who had taken advan
tage of the diftrefles of this conntry unci
who had largely fpeculatec in the certifi
cates given for services rendered by the
mofl meritorious citizens. Thefarmers anci
soldiers, knowing how much cheir countrj
had fullered du ing a long contett to sup
port the natural rights of men, they accept
ed certificates in lieu of their full pay, al
tho' public opinion at the very moment oi
acceptance, had reduced them to one eightl
part of their nominal value; thus making i
facrifice of their equitable demands to tilt
distresses oftheir country. These origina,
and honorable creditors, when thej
parted with their certificates, regarded the
public opinion refpeiting their value, as the
mofl certain criterion of the value of the
public debt. They knew that it was to.tht
prosperity of citizens, and not to the de
mands of the creditors of the state, that the
firft and original faith of government was
pledged. The claim of the citizen they re
garded as prior in title and superior in e
quitv; and never contemplated that the
rights and privileges of their fellow citi
zens were a part of the creditor's fecurit)
exprelled or implied. Congress coult
pledge nothing but the public eltate, whicl
confifled in an immense tract of unoccupiec
and unimproved land : this much was en
gaged, and nothing else could be engaged
to the public creditor.
Whilst with the ardor of freemen, we
were contending againlt the arbitrary views
of the Britifli government, who wilhed to
prevent the free sale of the produce of our
industry by commercial regulations, and tc
draw a revenue by means of indirect taxes
on tea, painter's colours, glass, and other
necessary articles, we had no idea that the
corrupt and wretched system of Britifli po
litics and finance, would ever become the
favorite object of an American government.
It is as much the duty of American citi
zens to oppose such ruinousmeafures, when
brought forward and supported by a few
androcratic characters amongst ourselves,
as when attempted to be enforced by a fo
reign power. The American farmers and
soldiers should take care that the property
facrificed by them to their country v hen
in distress, ij not by a mod iniquitous furd
ing system, now put into the pockets of un
deserving (peculators.

" Yesterday morning, the post-boy. with
the mail from this place for Philadelphia,
was flopped about t\\ o miles from to wn,
by a single footpad, who obliged him to
dismount, and mounting the horse himfelr,
proceeded a little dillance 011 the Phi.a
delphia road, when he dismounted, leit
the horse in the road, and made tor the
woods. The alarm being given, a number
of persons fat out in quelt of him : a (light
(now having fallen during the night, they
were enabled to trace him, from the road
co the place where he had left the port
manteau, which they found cut open, a
number of the letters, with their
seals broken, were lying around it; some
at the mails were left entire, and otheis
L.iken away : his footlteps were traced
from thence, across Joneses Falls and the
back of the town, into Howard's~ltreet.
A liberal reward has been offered by the
merchants and others, lor apprehending
the villain, and diligent search is making,
but hitherto without effect. We hope,
however, to be speedily able to announce
to tne public the apprvhenfion of this da
ring highwayman. One of the mails from
tnis place, tor Philadelphia, one end oi
which had been broke open, but the let
ters left untouched, was found in Colone
Howard's field, containing a number c>J
letters, some of which were directed t<
members of Congrels. It is supposed thai
the robber, conceiving these lecters to bt
entirely on public bulinefs, threw them a
way as useless; he, however, as far as we
can learn, mi (Ted the greatest part of his
booty; for one of them contained up
wards of eight hundred dollars, in bank
notes the property of a merchant in this

Continuation of Mr Steele's Speech,
on the reduction of the present Army
Eftablilhment.
THE question will now soon be taken ;
if adopted, I fliall be among those who
rejoice ; if rje&ed, among those who havt
alw vs fttbm tted â¢. i h a proper degree ol
decency to the deeifion of the majority,
But in any event, 'he public wi.l know
that we have asserted the sense of the peo
pie again ft Handing armies, that we art
anxious to dtf.nd the frontiers against theii
enemies, that we have recommended a fyf
te:n of ceccnomy and efficiency, inilead o!
profulion and delay, that we have rccom.
mended a fyi'tem calculated to producc
victory and peace, indead of disgrace aac
war, and that wc wish to rescue the gÂ«
vernment frotn the intoxication of tlx
t'm 1 and ail the apery of military ellab
lifhments.
He laid, he had been attentive to tht
arguments of tht opposition, and they tent
principally to four points. If nei Itr o
these positions be found tenable, the mo
tiot. will certainly succeed ; and that the;
are not tenable, is believed and will bi
fiiewn.
1 ft. It has been boldly asserted tha
the '"rclidet t is the author of the exiftinj
fyftcm.
2-.: lv They call in qneHion the finceritj
of our decli'.rdtiont in wifhmg to afford ef
fcCtual protection 10 the frontiers.
:â  iv. Tiny deny the competency o:
the militia.
4'h'y. The mpoiicy of reducing thee
ftahiihment, when a treaty is expected.
In regard to the firft, we deny that thÂ«
Preft'en is t:,e author of vhis plan of pro
feci;, ing the war, Hot having avowed ex
pli. 1 iy hirnfelf that he is so, and nodocu
men: appearing to confirm that opinion,
we are juftified i'l attributing a fylletr
wli ch apptarsti- ti' incfftthial, to his le
cretary and not to him.
It is true that the Secretary is only Â«
finger of is hand, & the intimate connec
tion which m uftofneceffityfubfiftbetweer
them, perhaps is the ground upon whicl
the assertion lias been made. The Secre
taries are all ecju. lly near to the President
and if it be admitted that he is the authoi
of this, he may with equal propriety, b<
said to have been the author of every fy t
tem on general fubjefts, which either o
them have recommended.
Wa. ' e the author of the report on th<
fifherics ? Was he he author of the plan foi
eftablilhing the National Bank ? It i:
known that he was not, and circumftancei
might be mentioned (which are withheld;
from delicacy) to confirm this opinion.
Was he the author of the funding fyf
tem ? Some gentlemen in the opposition tc
this motion, would not be willing to givt
the President that credit, if he claimed it ;
and some who support this motion, wouh!
not only be sorry that the President hat;
even clnimed fuc'h a credit, but believe
that it wes in no refp?Â£t attr butable tc
l>im. The fame gentleman
Wor: It,) who firft fferted th.t the Presi
dent was ne author of this militry plan,
in the fame speech, admitted it to be th
â war, as well as the plan of house, and then
argued on the neeffi'y of liability in our
measures. It is not very material to the
present question, whose plan it is ; being a
public meafuve. we are juftified in offering
our objedlions to it , and this is the firft
time that I have heard it publicly asserted,
that a government should perftvere in an
error because they had usdertaken it. Ii
the plan be a good one, it may be sup
ported by reason ; tf a bad one, no
ought to be called in to prop it up.
The iuconfiftency of that gentleman's(Mr,
'Wad'worth) arguments not only support!
the motion before the committee,but thews
the wretched fhifts which hav'e been used
to defeat it.
It has been said in the course of the de
bate, that individual members, and ever
this house, are incompetent to decide upon
the efficacy or inefficacy of military plans.
In answer to this it may be said, that it we
are not all generals, we are all members,
and that we have the privilege of thinking
for ourselves and for our conftitnents. To
admit this doctrine in the latitude which
has ben evpreffed, would be to introduce
military ideas indeed ; it would be to make
soldiers of us inflead of legislators ; nay
vvorfe than that, it would be to revive the
exploded do&rines of passive obedience and
non resistance.
In regard to the sincerity of his inten
tions to afford effedtual protection to the
frontiers, Mr. Steele said that he had been
fuffici ntly explicit, that a feeling for the
fufferers had diflated this motion ; that he
was forty it had been whispered in the ears
of some of the members, that it was in
tended to withhold the necessary appro
priations, and divert them to other pur
j;ofes.
If two regiments were inefficient to
garrison all the polls neceflary for defence,
he would even under certain reftri&ions,
consent to continue the three sub-legions,
thereby enabling the President to eftabiifii
double the number of ports now erected il
he should deem it advifeable. Regulai
;roops being incapable of active expedition;
laainft Indians in the wilderne s, his wid
was to abandon that system, and confint
:hem entirely to the gainfoo.
The next objection to the motion is th<
incompetency of the militia, and to fuppori
[his opinion, the gentleman from Connec
ticut (Mr. Wadfworth) has made this ex
preffion, " that as to the expedition unde
General St. Clair, the regulars Were few
&not to be named when compared with tin
number of the militia " The truth is, then
wasnot a man engaged th.-t day a sa rniliti;
man, except the advarce guard command
ed by Col Oldham, which c nlilted of 30c
perhaps a few more, the field return of .hi
day preceding the action being in thi
war office, this can be afecrtained wit!
p'ecifion. The ballance of the army or
that unfortunate day, had b.en enlided a;
regulars, even cloathed s rtgula s, wer<
fought as regulars, ;ind poor fellows, diet
ike regulars. Thty fuffcred the fate whicl
awaits every re ular army deltined for si
milar expedition#.' Even the handful o
militia employed that day, did not defiyvi
:bat name, they were chiefly substitute.Â» foi
draughted men f:om the ceded territory
Phis draught become unavoidable, fron
1 misfortune to General Sevier, which
Mi. Steele related.
Theat.ack on Adair has alft
jeen mentioned as a proof of the incom
petency of mi itia, and Mr. Steele infille<
that the only inference whLh could bi
drawn from thence was, that ICO militii
were able to repel, but not dedroy nea'
200 Indians. This event he conceivec
was in favor, and not againlt his motion.
He next adverted to the argument o:
Mr. Wa> fworth, in regard to the war o
1762; of the ednblifiiment of pods it
Pennsylvania and Virginia, and of tin
fno ess of Col. Bouquet's expedition 1
rwo worn-out regiments at that time weri
fufficient to defend the frontiers, and wit'r
the aid of the militia, to term nate th<
war, two new regiments, in them, all thi
i(igor which the gentleman described U
now pofiefs, with the aid of eitahlifhec
polls, and a much more effective militia
an certainly be equJ to the fame end
After examining Mr. W.'s arguments foi
Tome time, Mr. Ste. 1 said, that w hen ana
lyzed, it would be found, that they pro
V'. more than they were intended to prove
but the meiits of this motion did not re
quire that he fliould take advantage o
hefe indiscretions.
He Ibewed from the hi (lory of 1762
iiat tho' polls were eftiblilbed, with ;
handful of regular troops in each, the)
lerer answered the purpose of tfTeflua
orotedlion ; but the frontier people wen
drvays obliged, in a great degree, to de
end themfelve3 ; that tiny were bed cal
:u!atcd for that service, and that the)
ivoulii perform it now with alacrity anc
.uccefs, if well rewarded.
Mr Steele then refuted the objeftior
sgaiull the militia on account of theii
ivalte and expence which Mr. W. had al
luded to. The law allows a mounted vo
lunteer, furnilhing himlelf with a gooc
horse, good arms, provisions, and ever)
other necelfary, except ammunition, at
his own risque and expence, one dollai
per day. The exafl expence of such ar
expedition, can be calculated. Whethei
fuccefsful or not, the charge to the public
cannot be encreafed. The contractor's,
quarter-matter's and hospital department's
are all avoided, with the abuses, expences
and frauds attending such eftablifliments.
Mr. Steele enlarged upon this point, and
said that these were always found to be
the mod expensive depaitments in any ar
my, and that the federal treasury had felt
their effedls already. In favor of the mi
litia it may be alked, who fought the bat
tle of Bunker's Hill ? Who fought the
battle of New-Jersey .' Who have fought
the Indians so often with faccefs, under
Generals Wilkinfon, Scott, Sevier, and
others ? Who marched in 1776 under Ge
neral Rutherford, through the Cherokee
nation, laid waste their country, and for
ced them to peace ? Who fought the bat
ties of Georgia, under Clark and Twiggs ?
Who fought the battles of South-Caroli
na, under the command of an honorable
member, now present ? Delicacy forbids
to enlarge upon his successes in his pre
sence.
Who fought the ever memorable bat
tles of Cowpens, King's Mountain, Hang
ing Rock, BlackÃocks; the pivots, on
which the revolution turned in the south
ern dates ? In {hort, who fought all the
battles in the southern dates, while we had
a mere handful of regular troops, scarcely
the shadow, much less the reality of an
army ?
They were all fought by freemen, the
fubdantial freeholders of the country :
men attached to the revolution from prin
ciple : men who were sensible of their
rights and fought for them.
Such meir will not enlist in regular ar
mies, nor will any one who h.is the dispo
sition, or the constitution of a freeman
-1 It would give me pain to defer be the
j trafli which composes all regular armies:
They enlist far three dollars a month ;
which, in a countiv like the United Staes,
is a (jiffieient defcriptiou of their bodies as
well as their minds. Such men are not
fit to combat the moll active enemy in
the world. Here Mr. Steele read Major
, Gaither's and M jor Trueman's depositi
ons, refpefiiiig the defeat of the 4th No
vember, I 791, dating, that they could
j not fee the Iniliins, because they were
behind trees, &c. that the regular troops
i tried, but could not fight that way ; that
they seemed to be ftu'ptd, and incapable
of refidance ; and that if any General in
world had commanded such men that
day, he mud have been defeated as they
were.
An additional argument, and one of
the mod weighty too, againd regular ex
peditions, in this species of warfare, is
that by the slowness o! their movements,
the force of the enemy may be concentra
ted, âtime is afforded thein to form alli
ances, and to confederate againd those
whom they coniider a common enemy.
| It is otherwise with militia tncurfions. He
off red a number ofreafons to (hew that it
1 was so, and how essential for the intered
of the United States, to adopt a policy
calculated to detach the tribes from each
other as n<uch as pofiible.
But it has been said these men were not
regular troops. Mr. Steele alked, what
then were they ? They surely were not
mili r ia.
