On the ADDITIONAL DUTIES on
IMPORTS.
THERE never existed a period in
which the problematical position,
-that the limited faculties of the human
mind are incapable of attending to ma
ny important objects at once, was moic
â %iterally verified, than at the present
ira. The electioneering discussions.
with which the public papers are con
tinually filled, afford a evidence
that local politics fuperiecie in compa
rative importance, confederations of <-
federal nature. With a diipaffionau
mind,coolly speculating on remote con
fequcnces, the contingencies of a mo
ment, and the success of partial views,
must appear objects of inferior magni
tude, when placed in competition with
mealurcs which are to affeth the union
and however oppreflive in operation
to be perpetuated. Would it not e*.
vince a more lir.cere attachment to the
true principles of equal liberty, if, in
stead of directing our whole attentior
to the choice of state officers, we view
ed with a jealous eye, and endeavourec
to arreftthe lilent, the gradual, the pro
greflive accumulation of burdens which
the general government is irnpoiing on
our commerce ?
The Secretary of the Treasury, in e
late report to Congress, on the fubjefi
of ways and means, propoled to augment
the present rates of duty, by such addi
tions as must inevitably tend to opprcls
the mercantile, and with it every othei
class of interests in the country. Thai
the present system of impost is preffec
beyond its natural bounds, mult be ob
vious to eveiy perl'on engaged in com
merce -.âthat it far exceeds any com
mercial impositions by the (hates, previ
ous to the ratification of the federal
constitution, is indubitable : â-but the
riecefiities of government, the probabi
lity that general commercial regulati
ons pervading the confederacy, would
have a favourable influence ; and a per
suasion that no additional duties woulc
beimpofed, operated to reconcile the
public mind to the increase of publie
burdens. How this expe6lation is re
alized the proposed augmentation abun
dantly (hews.
Whether a possibility exists of ex
tending the present high rates of dut)
to the degree contemplated by the Se
cretary, without danger to the revenue,
is a queftien which merits the l'eriou:
attention of Congress. To ensure obe
dience, the temptations for evading
laws should not be rendered too strong,
When duties are moderate there can be
little incentive to rilque the loss of im
ported property ; when exorbitant, the
reverfeisevidently true. Fromfufpicion!
of illicit practices in this particular, foi
which our extended and indented sea
coast is peculiarly favourable, gov
ernment has conceivcd it adviieable tc
employ a number of cutters thele, al
tho' expensive, must of neceflity be in
adequate to the object, when the mo
tives to smuggling are great. To mul
tiply the number would be enhancing
Uie expencc, with very little addition
â¢> security. It would moreover exlii
' bit the odious appearance of tyranny
firft to load the citizens with intolerable
burdens, and then, under the fan&ior
of law, to harrafs them into submission
Conciliation is necessary in our present
federal circumstances. Measures cal
culated to embitter the minds of an in
fluential class of citizens, can have nc
favorable effect on the {lability of gov
ernment. Oppression is at all times de
tellable ; but when those who have
been the principal agents in ere&ing a
power intended to connect, pervade,
and improve the mass of political hap
piness, become the firft. or only vi&ims
of its rapacity, the refle&ion is more
exasperating, and may eventually ter
minate in dangerous cxceffes.

Spain, by a rapacious spirit of mono
ooly, and from a determination to ren
der her American possessions as produc
tive as possible, has so injudiciously ex
panded the fyfiemofher revenue laws,
and create d such a multiplicity of offi
cers to guard and ensure its collection.
:hat in (lead of promoting, the deprelfc;
her rcfources. A living writer of great
merit and erudition, who has made the
;olicy of that country a particular ob
rÂ£t of refcarch, gives the following fatts
as the rcfult of his enquiries :
" The commercial regulations of
Spain, with refpeft to her colonies, art
100 rigid and fyflcmatical to bt: carried
into complete execution. The legifla
.ure that loads trade with impositions
:oo heavy, or fetters it by reftriftions
;oo severe, defeats its own intention ;
and is only multiplying the induce
ments to violate its statutes, and propof
,ng an high premium to encourage illi
cit traffic. The Spaniards,both in Eu
rope and America, being circumscribed
in their natural intercourse by the jea
;oufv of the crown, or opprelTed by its
;xattions, have their invention continu
ally on the stretch how to elude its e
li6l;s. The vigilance and ingenuity ol
private interest discover means of el
cfting this, which public wisdom can
lot forclee, nor public authority pre
sent. This spirit counteracting that oi
he laws, pervades the commerce of
Spain with America in all its branches:
ind from the highest departments in
Government descends to the lowest.
The very officers employed to check
:ontraband trade are often employed as
nftrumentsin carrying it on ; and the
boards instituted to reftram and punish
t, are the channels through which it
lows. The king is fuppoled, by the
noft intelligent Spanish writers to be
defrauded by various artifices, of more
;han one half of the revenue which he
sught to receive from America ; and as
ongasitisthe intereflof to many per
"ons to screen those artifices from de
letion, the knowledge of them will ne
/er reach the throne." Robertfons's
Hist. Amer. vol. 3d page 351.
An opinion has been embraced by a
ew theorists, and urged with all the ar-
Jor of conviction, that however greal
he duty on imported articles may be.
t cannot operate partially, because the
:onfnmer eventually pays it, and tlie
nerchant experiences no more of the
yurden than his natural {hare on the
;orninodities used in his own family â
This reasoning has, indeed, the fpeciou:
emblance of truth to support it, but un
fortunately, like many other points 01
tbflract l'peculation, it is contradictec
3y the practice of every day. It is.
ruth too notorious to be denied by an)
nan acquainted with the Europeai
radeâa truth to which every merchant
rom his experimental knowledge wil
-eadily fubferibe, that in the ultimati
idjuftment of his profits, it is idle to at
:empt calculating on a higher advance
han was generally and cafily obtainec
ariorto the Revolution ; if so, the dut)
s a facrifice which he cannot recover
In the Federalist, a performance afcrib
â¢d to Mr. Hamilton, we find this poin
admitted and explained with great abil
ity andprecifion .*
" Suppose the federal power of taxa
tion were to be confineei to duties or
imports, it is evident, that the govern
ment, for want of being able to com
mand other resources, would frequent
ly be tempted to extend these duties tc
an injutious excess. There are persons
who imagine that this can never be the
cafe ; since the higher they are,themorc
it is alledged they will tend to discour
age an extravagant consumption, tc
produce a favourable balance of trade,
and to promote domeflic manufactures
Hut all extremes are pernicious in vari
ous ways. Exorbitant duties on im
ported articles serve to beget a general
spirit cf smuggling, which is alway;
prejudicial to the fair trader, and even
tually to the revenue itlelf: they tend
to render other dalles of the communi
ty tributary in an improper degree to
the manufa&uring dalles, to whom they
give a premature monopoly of the mar
kets : they lometimes force industry out
of its more natural channels into others
in which it flows with lels advantage, â
and in the lafl place, they oppreis the
merchant who is often obliged to pay
the n himlelf without any retribution
from the consumer. When the demand
is equal to the quantity of goods at mar
ket, the consumer generally pays the
duty ; but when the markets happen to
be overstocked, a great proportion falls
upon the merchant, and sometimes not
only exhausts his profits, but breaks in
upon his capital. It is not always pof
(ible to raifc the price of a commodity
in exact proportion to every additional
irriDofition laid upon it.. The merchant,
Specially in a country of small commer
;ial capital, is often under the necel
!ity o! keeping prices down in order to
i more expeditious sale." âVide Fedc

That the Secretary has either chang
ed his opinion within a very limited pe
riod, or finds himfelf inclined or impel
led to accommodate his ientiments tc
the capricious suggestions of fancy, will
appear from comparing his I ast repori
on the mod eligible mode of Supplying
the treasury, with another presented tc
ihc congreflional House of P-eprefenta
iveson the 17th of December, 1790, ir
which we find the following judiciou:

would not be expedient to exceed
There is fatisfaftory evidence that the)
annot be extended further withou
:ontravening the sense of the body o!
merchants; and though it is not to b(
jdmitted as a general rule, that this cir
ttumftance ought to conclude against thf
expediency of a public mealure ; yet

izens has manifefted towards the na

which they have hitherto fcconded it:

jer with which they look lorward tc

of things; there will be perceivec
0 exist the inoft solid rcai'ons again!
ightly passing the bounds which coin
;ide with their imprellions of what i
eafonable and proper. It would be
in every view, inaulpicious to give oc
cafion lor a luppofition, that trade aloru
is destined to feel tlie immediate weigh
jf the hand of government, in every new
emergency of the treasury.
" Admitting the general position
.hat the consumer pays the duty ; yet i
will not follow that trade may not b<
jffentiaily dillrefl'cd and injured by car
rying duties on importation to a heigh
which is difproportioned to the mercan
:ilc capital of a country. It may no
anly be the cause of diverting too large
1 share of it from the exigencies of buli
ness ; but as the requisite advances tc
atisfy the duties will, in many, if not n
noft cases, precede the receipts froir
the sale of the articles on which they arc
aid, the consequence will often be fa
rifices which the merchant cannot as
ford to make.
1; Appearances do not juftify such ar
:ftimate of the extent of the mercantile
capital of the United States, as to encou
rage material accumulations on the al

credit. The operation would be apt to
be regarded as artificial, as destitute of
solidity, as prel'enting a numerical in
crease ; but involving an attual diminu
tion of revenue. The diftrufl of the ef
ficacy of the present provision might al
io be accompanied with a doubt of a bet
er substitute hereafter.' The infer
:nce would not be unnatural that a de
left of other means, or an inability to
rommand them, could alone have given
jirth to so unpromising an effo: t to drav/
ill from one iotirce.
" A diverfification of the nature of
the funds is desirable on other accounts.
It is clear that less dependence can be
placed on one fpeciesot funds (and that
oo liable to the vicissitudes of the con
inuance or interruption of foreign in
:ercourfe) than upon a variety of differ
ent funds formed by the union of inter
lal with external objects.
" The inference, from thefc various
ind important confederations fcems to
le, that to attempt to extract from du
:ies on imported articles, the sum necef
ary to a complete proviiion for the pub
ic debt, would probably be both decep
;ive and pernicious; incompatible with
he interests not less of revenue than of
rommerce ; that resources of a differ
ent kind must of neceflity be explored ;
ind that the felc&ion of the most fit ob
eÂ£ts is the only thing which ought to
accupy enquiry.
" Besides the establishment of supple
mentary funds, it is requilite to the sup
port of the public credit, that those efta
alifhed should stand upon a footing
which will give all reasonable alTurancc
as their effe&ual collection."
The conclusion reluElantly admitted by
the Secretary, that of all possible expe
dients for encreafing the revenue, a re
tort to additional duties is the most el
igible, seems to be founded partly on.
the fallacious hypothelis, that foreign
commodities are importedon much more
" advantageous terms than heretofore"
âhence he infers " a circumflance
which must alleviate the prelTurc of
fome-what higher rates of duty, and
must contribute at the fame time to re
concile importers to burdens, which be
ing connected with an efficacious dis
charge of the duly of government, are
of a nature to give solidity and perma
nency to the advantage they enjoy un
der it."

Paris, March 19. âVarious contra
dictory accounts have from time to time
come to hand relative to the disturban
ces at Aries, Avignon, Carpentras, Aix,
and other places about the mouth of the
Rhone. It is remarkable that a certain
peculiar enthusiasm prevails in all the
f'outla of France for the principles of the
riencedRevolution, and on the otlier liana an
opposition equally violent, which can
not but produce a civil warâl he corn
mifiionershavc been able to do nothing,
and every thing fecms returning to its
original state of nature, tlie lli'ongelt
party giving law to the weaker, and the
democrats marching under arms to re
duce the above named cities. From 7
to 8000 Marfeillans, besides the nation
al guardsat Nil'mes, &e. with 18 pieces
of artillery, are determined to destroy e
veryremaining hope of theiradverfaries.
Two deputies from the department ot
the Mouths of the Rhone, have been pre
fenced to the ailemblyâthey report that the
inhabitants of Aries, Apt, and Avignon have
fuffered extremely from the anti-revolu
tioni'.ts, who, under the direJlion 01 tiie
priests, have torn up the pavements, de
stroyed the cannon, and even fired upon the
national guard.âOthers, however, fay that
tiiefeoutrages are more owing to the patri
otic chibs an-l theconftitutioiiulprielb than
any other cause.
In co He raence of the representations o',
thef-deputies, a quei'tion arose in the ai'-
fembly, whether the counter-revolution
ists at Aries, See. fhn'l be difarmed âupon
which the new minister of war informed
tne aifembly that he had taken measures to
difpr.tch into the southern provinces several
battallions of troops of the line and nation

In the session of the aflembly, on the 17th
of March, the following observations were
addressed to them by M. Lobjoie on the
fubjeft of diplomatic agents, resident abroad
at foreign courts. â" Under such a consti
tution as that of regenerated France, it is
thought ulelefs, by forne, to support any
m;.'lifters whatever at foreign courts âIt
were to be wished that all nations, united
by t'.ie fame fp'rit, might alike embrace
peace and jufiice â but it is to be cenfidered
that great political bodies have no affec
tions exceot those that concern them indi
vidually,and 'till philosophy (hall so far have
perfected iocial order as to make sovereign?
equ :1 participaters therein, I believe it is
the interest even of regenerated France, to
have an eftabliihiaent of foreign agents. It
is my opinion, notwithstanding, that there
is no neceff.ty for that herd of diplomatic
officers, authorized by fovereigus at some
courts, wiio can nei:h'r <lo good nor harm
âIt is high time a reform took place in the
organisation of the old diplomatic system,
eipeci ally in regard to titles, which only
occaficn jealoudes among the agents of the
public at other courts. At one place there is
an ambaflador, at another an envoy, here
are ministers, there a charge-des-affaires ;
in some places we have relidents, in others
consuls, &c.âall different names to fignify
the fame thing.âlnfteadofall this variety,
let us defigmte our foreign ministers under
onelmple name,fuch a; Legal-, orMJJenger

not be afbamed to imitate, no otherwise
distinguished those who were the mere par
five organs of their supreme willâBur how
is this new plan of uniformity to be made
general through Europe ? The answer is
easyâLet us difpatcb only men with the
title of Legates, to other powers, and juftas
they treat the simple character ofthefe per
sons, so let 11s treat their ambafladors, and
others under high founding appellations.--
When we have only one rank of diploma
tic servants, there will naturally arise but
one diftinftion, that of virtue and ability
i 1 the execution of the duties of office.---
Real talents will by this means be brought
forth, and the diplomatic honors no longer
diur,raced by ridiculous vanity and felf-co 1-

mittee.
March 34. It'is remarkable that the late
vacant places in the ministry, for domrjlic

answer, certainly, not It may be ques
tioned, however, whether the Jacobins,
by encouraging licentiousness and disobedi

At the firlf discovery of the northern con

25 or 30 years ago they were firft dilco

New-York. It has been observed that
ever fmce that time they have gradually be
come more and more plenty on the fiihing

miles farther eastward. The present fea
t'on has afforded an abundance, hitherto un

two or three have been caught )?ft year
about Chingotcague lhoalr inlat. 38. on the

ivculd feeni that the Cod-filh is gradually

(include from hence that the Banks of
