NEWARK, Feb. 22.
Our frontier inhabitants do not pos
sess a foot of land, nor have they at
tempted to take possession of any, but
what has been purchased, with a valua
ble consideration, and ratified by the
most solemn treaties. The value of fix
thousand pounds was paid at one pay
ment forthe Kentucky lands, and at that
time the Indians were perfectly fatistied,
and remained so till persuaded to join
the Britilh, the last war. All the land;
over the Ohio River that have been Ibid
by Congress, were afligiled to them by
the moftfolemn contra&s by the Indians,
and they fufferec! our people to fettle
them in p.'ace, were constantly with
them eve-y day, trading, and fully satis
fled with ' the compensations they hac
received; Governor St. Clair; Judge
Symmes, and the other officers in the
said territory, were determined to sup
port the treaties of the United State:
with the Indians ; but what was the
event ? The Indians paid no regard tc
the laws, Hole their horses, and Wher
complaint was made, their Chiefs said
they could not help it, refufed to punish
the thieves, or even restore the horses.
These complaints only exasperated them,
they murdered several of our traders
and privately took their property, which
obliged the inhabitants to forbid them
:oming to trade ; "the consequence was,
they immediately fell upon the defence
less frontier inhabitants and butchered
them without mercy or discrimination.
It would be full as reasonable to as
sert, that the A.ngels and Devils are in
the fame situation, as to fay " the In
dians are in the fame situation with rcf
pett to us that we were in with refpett to
Great-Britain at the commencement of
the late coHtinental war." Were we
fighting for property we had fold for a
valuable consideration and conveyed by
lolemn treaty? Or was Great-Bi itain
only defending herfelf against a cruel
and mjrcilefs foe, who, unprovoked,
had wantonly in the most barbarous
manner butchered her fubjefts without
jiici rininatiorrr
To give an idea of the present fitua
:ion of our friends in the western coun
:ry, I will publish an extract of a letter,
atel y wrote by a perfonin that country.
" I expect the Indians will be very
troublesome in the spring and summer,
unless Congress should take the matter
up more feriouily, and not fend a hand
ful of men to be destroyed, and have no
other effect than to exasperate them, & if
poflible, make them more inveterate.
If Congress do not fend a powerful army
against them, they will break up all our
I'ettlements over the Ohio river ; for as
soon as the leaves put out, they will be
concealed near our improvements & will
kill so many of our people going to their
work, as will discourage the reft to that
degree, as to drive them all to the Ken
tucky country. I think every person
that has any feeling, must be lenlibleof
the neceflity of vigorous measures, upon
hearing the cruel tortures that are in
flitted upon those unhappy persons that
fall into their hands.â l hink how ma
ny in the course of two years have been
obliged to stand fpettators of their hus
band, wife or children, tortured to death
in the most lingering manner that savage
barbarity could inventâdragged to their
towns, at this moment in slavery, treated
in the most cruel manner, liable, when
ever the barbarous monsters get in a
frolic, to be tortured to death, to grati
fy their vindi&ive and insatiable pafli
ons. The Indians are determined upon
war. When a meflage was sent tc
them last year to purl'uade them tc
peace, they led out one of the prison
ers they had taken and burnt him tc
death, in the most cruel manner, in pre
sence of the meflenger. The subject is
too affe&ing to dwell upon"
My countrymen, be not deceivedâ
you may be allured the Indians are de
termined upon war, and if you remove
from the western country, they will sol-
Ipw you over the mountains and butcher
the wives and children of those on the
frontier ; for nothing but neceflity will
bring them to a sense of their duty.
Too much time and money has been
spent in fruitleis negociations to bring
them to peaceâmore than would be just
to give has been ordered, and the alter
native left us is to give up eur frontier

On a suitabLe provision for,theCi.Â£RGYÂ»
[From a late London paper.]
THE firft political movement of this
aody of men, was the alfuming an ex
ternal fanftity of manners, and efta
slifhing a prepoffeflion on the mind-i of
-heir fellow men of something facr'edbc*
ng annexed to their persons and char
ters ; and to heighten an.d improve
this reverence, they pretended frequent
*nd familiar intercourse with the Dei
ty, and that at their intercession he
would grant every petition they prefer
red to him ; and finally, they inculcated
the principle that the supreme Being,
by his partial and peculiar providence,
perpetually interfered in the tranfa&i
ons of individuals, and that thff'r daily
interposition on the behalf of ii ers
was elTentially neceftary to foften an
deprecate his wrath and vengeance.
Thus by flow, but sure degrees, they
reached the lummit of their views, and
got undet their absolute controul, not
only the consciences, but the persons
and property of the bulk of the people,
and retain that dominion until this
hour over ninety-nine hundred parts of
the world j and thus, only, can be ac
counted for this universal infatuation
operating on the contrition, fears, and
appreheafions of the multitude, by the
crafty insinuations of this malignant
tribe ; who,,by the impious tenet of the
constant interference of the deity in the
tranfattions of mankind, precluded the
firft gift of their creator, free agency;
thereby making their God the author
of, or conniver at, all evil. But they
flopped not here ; for ambition, power,anil avarice, know no bounds : in procef
of time they impioully alfuitiei! the prero
gatives and attribntes of the deity; they
made themselves to be worfliipped and
adored ; they poflefled themselves ot tem
poralities and principalities, and trod on the
necks of kings ; and, by the Subordinate
agencyrof their brethren, they sowed dif
fention, religious and civil, throughout eve
ry land, where they obtained a footing-
Upon a retrofpett view of the history ot all
nations, we Ihall find them, either openly
or covertly, the active promoters of perfe
ctions, blood and {laughter, rebellions and
murders.
The foregoing portrait, although mors
immediately applied to the chriitian clerg)
of former times, yet is also jtlftly applicable
to the fame class in every nation of the
GJobe.
It was aptly said, by a very competen!
judge of human nature, that, pritjls of all re
ligions are the fame. Their power, tlieir in
fluence, their consequence, and depredati
ons have ever been obtained under the in
sidious malk of some religious fyfteirt 01
other ; the mockery, the fallacy, the impi
ety of all, will be obvious to every unpreju
diced mind, that strictly scrutinizes their
internal ancl external tenets and principles
therefore, it is full time the malk fhouid bt
taken oft", and mankind released from tin
leading strings of such religious nurses, ant
restored to his native freedom, which ha
been (hackled for so many ages in fuperlti
tious bondage.
We willi not the abolition of the church
es, the priesthood, or religious worihip
our aim is, to fee them all reduced to fuel
aftandard as may do" honour to the over
ruling power, and be confident with rea
son, true,piety, and propriety. It is true
the extenlive arm of Sacerdotal power am
influence lias in these latter times beei
Shortened, and rendered ieSs mischievous
but it is Hill too long, and it behoves ever;
christian government to cut it off.
Itisnotour intention to fend the priest
hood a grazing, but only to reduce them t(
a refpeiiable level. The abject slavery anc
dependence of the subaltern clergy, ha
long been a reproach to the church and le
gillature of every christian government;
but if our plan takes place, there (hall noi
be a ragged curate in his majesty's domini
ons at lealt. As proportions are now be
come the mode ot address on all occasions,
we ihail here adopt it.
Proportion lit. It is humbiy propoSed
that the dignified clergy, under every de
nomination, be divelted of all rank, prece
dence, and title in the llate and church ;
laving and excepting that of Doilor in Di
vinity only, which every member of the
church ihall indifcriininately enjoy on the
fame refpe&able and rational level.
2d. That aperiod be put to the long mis
chievous, illegal, and irreligious practice ol
mixing temporalities with Spiritualities ;
and that all endowments of whatfoevei
kind, annexed to cathedrals, churches,
chapels, and colleges be Sequeltrated, re
stored, and appropriated to the relief of exi
gences of the Itace, and heavy burdens oi
the people.
3d. That the forms of ordination, Sub
scription, and degrees, be wholly abolilhed
as ufelefs âand, to the full, as farcical a;
the noli epijcofari ; and that the king, as su
preme head of the church, (hall, by himfelf.
or by delegation to his ministers of state,
occaiionally ordain and present men ol
found and tried morals and understanding.
to the belt of their knowledge and inform
ation ; profound learning and knowledge
in the dead languages being absolutely non
elfent'ials.
4th. That a considerable reduction flial
Vie made in the number of churches, anc
every c hurch be independent, and but one
incumbent to each chureh ; and in cafe oi
sickness or inability,his place Ihall be Suppli
ed by the incumbent of the next adjoining
pariih, on proper notice given of the necef
lary variation of the hour, for the com
mencement of the lervice.
sth. That a stipend of five hundred
pounds per innum, exempt from all taxes,
office fees, and deductions whatsoever, be
eitabljlhed for every married incumbent,
and three hundred for every one unmarri
ed, in lieu of all tythes, surplice fees, ant
other perquiiites, with a decent and com
i.iodious parsonage house, handsomely fur
nilhed at all points, in the vicinity of the
church, the whole to be kept in repair bj
the government; the stipend to be paic
from the treasury half yearly, the firft hall
year in advance upon their induction ; as
those stipends are more than equal to land
ed estates of eight and five hundred [sound 1
per annum, it cannot but be deemed a res
pectable provilion. Whether the exigen
ces of the state can admit of this ample pro
vision, the legislature alone are the compe
tent judges.
6th. Th;it the reduced dignitaries, ir
compensation for their losses in temporali
ties, Ihall have the preference 011 the new
presentations taking place, and next to
them the Doctors of Divinity of the present
eltablilhment; but as our plan only propos
es one incumbent for cach church, the Su
pernumeraries in orders, which overflow
the land, must not be left to itarve : there
fore, we propose an annuity of one hun-
drtd pounds ft -11 be i'clled upon them for
their live? ; and as many of them wilKdrop
off annually, the state \\ ill soon be reltjafet!
from that burden.
7th. That the Doctors fliall still retain the
lonorary titles, insignia, and
if there are any] of being chaplains to hit
uajeity and the nobility.
Observations on the Western Ter
ritory and the Indian War ;
In a Letter to a Friend.
[ From the American ApUlo.~\ .
Dear Sir,
THE late publication of the Secretary of the
War Department, ptofelfes to give an
iccount of the causes of the preilcnt war, and
is it comes from authority, it eieferves to be treat
id with refpett ; but you will allow me to uft
he freedom ot' an American citizen in remark
ng on some parts of it ; and perhaps what 1
originally intended to lay to you on the sub eft
nav be conveyed in the form of remarks ir
his pioduftion as well as in any form whatever
After mentioning the treaties held with the
ndians in the yeais 1784, 1785 and 1786, the
Secretary tells us, that " certain turbulent anc
nalignant characters, residing among some oi
he northern and weilern tribes, excited com
plaints and uneasiness againjl thojt treatieslr
1 subsequent paragraph he lays, thdt " the go
vernment of the United States had been carefu
ind attentive to obviate the dilfatisfaclion whicl
nad been excited, and to eftablilh us claim tc
he lands relinquifhed,on the principle of eqmt
j/j/epuichafe," and this purchase was made will
;6,000 dollars. Afterwards he fays, "it doc.
lot appear that the present war has been occa
sioned by any dilpute relatively to the buundane
illablilhed by tbe laid treaties." On thole paf
ages 1 would remark,
1. That I have no doubt the Congress ant
heir commitfioners, who framed those treaties
ifted honorably and uprightly according to thei
deas of propriety.
2. There are certain difficulties attending
jurchafes made of the Indians, which have fre
jue.ntly occurred on other limilar occasions;
uch as theseâTo know when a tribe is full',
ind fairly represented at a treaty ; whether tha
ribe has an exclulive right to the traÂ£i of coun
ty which they adume to Cede. To make ar
idequate compenlatioi: for the land purchased
ind to know whether that compenlution bt
iquitablv divided amoug those who have a iigh
.0 it. Whether any of these difficulties exit
n regard to these treaties, may be a proper sub
eft of enquiry.
But, 3. Supposing none of them to exifl.
there is one principle on which these treaties
.vere grounded, on our part, which may, with
:he greatell probability, be supposed to have
excited dilfatisfaftion" among the Indians,
ind which no purchase money may have beer
-ble to remove. This principle is that of Sove
reignly. If you will look into the treaties ol
itanwix, M'lntofhand Miami, you will fee the
prominent features of it.
In that of 1784, with the Six Nations, the
word itfelf does not a&ually appear, but yot
will find the language to be " The United State'
?ive peace to the Six Nations and receive then
nto their protection." Inthatof 1785, with the
Wianefots, &c. the language rises a little high
er ; " The Indians acknowledge themselves anc
their tribes to be under the proteflion of the
United States, and of no other Sovereign whatso
ever." In the next treaty, made in 1786, with
the Shawanefe, the language rises into the super
lative degtce, they " acknowledge tbe United
States to be the file and absolute Sovereign of aL
the territory ceded to them by a treaty of peace
made between them and the king of Great Bri
tain."
In conformity to this idea, the lands beyond s
certain boundary are said to be " allotted to the
Indians for hunting ground," and certain traÂ£ls
within the said hunting ground are lL referved tc
the United States," for forts and trading places;
and the Indians are made to "relinquish all ti
tle or pretence? of title," to the lands on this fide
of the boundary.
From the language used in these treaties, does
It not appear, that the commissioners of the
United States luppofed themselves to represent
the sole and absolute Sovereigns, of the whole
territory comprehended between the Atlantic,
the Milfifippi and the Lakes ; that when they
gave peace to the Indians, fhey had a right tc
rrferve what lands they pleased to themselves, and
allot what lands they pleased to the Indians ?
Now, however fond we may be of the idea
of Sovereignty over the tribes, and over the lands
of thelndrans, and however just a title to it we may
suppose is derived to us from the treaty of peace
made with the king of Great-Biitain, yet we
mult remember that the Indians themselves treat
this idea with contempt; and consider them
selves as absolute proprietors of the country, and
as an independent people ; and if absolute pro
ptiety and independence are not the foul and
e(Fence of sovereignty, 1 know not what is.â
Those natioi.s which have not entered into such
treaties with us mull, according to their own
ideas of independence, despise those who have.
And can we wonder that they refufe our invi
tations to treat of peace, and that the Miami war
rior Ihould " drop the belt off his shoulder," as
Mr. Knox tells us, when such a proposal was
made P since they know, that in signing a treaty
with us they mufl acknowledge our sovereignty
and relinquish their bwn independence by ac
cepting of our proteflion 5 Though we may
tflefl to call those characters " turbulent anc
malignant," who have excited complaints againf
these tieaties ; yet they rr.av pofiubly be revered
among them, as ihe Sons of Liberty were once
among us, though at the fame time they were
loaded with us liarfli and opprobious epithets,
by the friends of British uluipation.
A gentleman of a refpeftable character, whe
is intimately acquainted with the Indians of the
Six Nations, told me, not long since, that th<
western tribes reason on the fubjeft in the famt
manner that Pym and Hambden reasoned againf
the ship money in the time of Charles 1. ant
that we reasoned against the claims of Butain tc
draw our money away by taxes. " What (fa\
they) do you think that the king of Englanc
by making a line in the air with his finger car
give away our land to whom he pleases ? No
our forefathers came out of this earth * man)
hundred years before the king of England's fub
jtfts ever set foot upon it. If you want lane
we will give it you. We always gave it whet
you asked it, and there is enough for us and foi
you ; but you have already more than you car
cultivate. It is not the value of the land that wt
contend foi, but the principle on which you
claim it; if we admit that, we give up our rigl
to the whole." Ought we not to refpefl th<
Indians for holding sentiments so similar to ou
own '
1 will conclude this letter with an extras
from a work of governor Pownal. entitled " tin
Administration of the Colonies." ltisthefenti
ments of an honest man, well acquainted witl
the much injured savages of America, and ma;
with as great propriety be addrelfed to usasi
was to the British government at the lime whei
it was written. ,
"To do justice to our faith and honor, b;
treating the Indians according to the real spin
of our alliances with them ; to do juflice 10 then
in their lands ; to give up that idle, ufelrl
claim of dominion over them, are points aMo
lutely necellury to be adopted into our politics
unleis we have ferioully taken the resolution tt
force our way by war. Until thele points art
adopttd, we {hall never have peace. And it dc
ferves mature deliberation how we engage to set
tleAmeiicaby war.
" While these poor tribes of hunters remain
it will be our own fault if they do not remain it

ed to the remembrance of the House, by
Mr. Murray, but was not called up, to be
acted upon.
The order of the day being called for, on
General Jackson's petition, reflecting the
Georgia election,
Mr. Wayne moved a resolution to the
following effect:
â¢â¢ Refblved, That the time for reading
the evidences and documents on the peti

and those of the fitting member, be post
poned until the Monday in March
next; to the end that the whole of the tes
timonies may come fully before the House,
in order for a free and full investigation of
the merits of that election."
Mr. Speaker laid before the HouSe a let
ter from General Jai.kfoi>, Rating that tip
was waiting at the bar of the House, and
prepared to enter into proof of the"allega
tions set forth in his former petition.
On motion, that the petitioner Ihould be
admitted to be heard in perien, or by coun
sel, âThe question being taken, and passing
in the affirmative,
General Jackson having a feat affignedto
lim within the bar, arose, and addreifed the
House in a short speech, which he conclu-
Jed with a declaration, that he was now
sally prepared, and hoped the business
[night come to an immediate trial.
After a debate of some length, the fol
lowing resolution was agreed to âYeas 36,
âNays, not counted.
" Kefolved, That the trial of the con

During the course of the debate, an ho

General Jackson set him right, byinform
ng him and the House, that he " fubmitttdj

Immediately after the passing of the above

Mr. Baldwin moved for leave to lay or,
he table (to be used in such manner as tht
House might think proper) certain paper:
â¢elative to the election, which the governoi
if Georgia, had, by the direction ot the le
riflature of that commonwealth, tranfmit
:ed to him, to be laid before the House.
Those papers were certified, under the fig
;ature of the governor, and the seal of the
fate.
Objections were made to receiving tht
lapers. .
One gentleman hoped they would not bt
â¢eceived.
Another thought it improper to produc
hem before the day of trial, and oppofei
their being laid on the table.
A third, besides opposing their accept
ince, talked of moving a resolution,
' That any decision of a state legislature
rending to decide the validity of the elec
:ion of a member of that House, is a viola
:ionand invasion of the rights of the House,
4nd, in order to fliew the sense of the Horn
m the fubjeft, he would, if Mr. Baldwi
in his motion for leave to prefen
the papers, move for calling the yeas t an
nays on the question.
After a debate of three quarters of a
hour, on the fubjeft of receiving the pa
pers,
Mr. Baldwin withdrew them, 'till th
day of trial.Mr. Laurance, from the committee, to
whom were referred two petitions from
merchants of New-York and Philadelphia, ,
refpe&ing the duties on tea, reported a re

Mr. Murray presented an address from
J. Churchman ; praying, for reasons set
forth, a lpeedy decilion on his memorial

curred in resolving that " the South Caro

There being every appearance of a gene

are advised not to fell their state certificates
at the present prices, as there mud be a

The representatives of the state of Geor

Early in January, the mulattoes (in re

were put to death) maflacred all the whites
then in their power, or that they could get
hold of for some time after. About the

We hear from Boston that a new edition
of the AMERICAN GEOGRAPHY, is
now preparing for the press by the Rev.
Jedidiah Morse. The author justly observes,
in his proposals for printing this work, that
no system of American Geography, hitherto
published on the other fide of the Atlantic
by foreigners, is to be implicitly relied on
for information. As an instance of this, he
quotes two egregious errors by European
Geography-mongers ; one of them, who
published his system in 1789, very gravely
informs his readers that " the state of Ver
mont is a vast country, situated eastward of
New-Hampshire ; south of Maflachufetts,
and weft of New-York."âThe other, w as
an error imbibed by the celebrated Lord
North, from some such faulty system as that
just mentioned ; his lordfliip having observ
ed in the debate on the Boston Portbill, and
â¢ the bill to remove the board of customs
from the town of Boston, that the mer
chandize would now be landed at Marble
head, in the province of Salem," &c.â The
work now proposed, (fays Mr. Morse) is
designed to remedy the inconveniencies in
cident to most European systems of Geogra
phy, (where they treat of America) by com
prising in one sizeable volume a full and ac
curate description of the American States,
which wilt constitute thefrjlpart. The
second part will comprise an account of the
other three parts of the globe, collected
from the molt Authentic materials.

Much is said in the London prints of the,
projected new settlement at Sierra Leona,
in Africa, notwithstanding the unhealthi
nefs offthe place, where it is certain, even
the American descendants of African blacks
can scarcely exist, for the insalubrity of the
air. Discerning people have surmised the
whole to be a fclieme to rid the kingdom of
a vast number of fuperfiuous free blacks,
who are considered as a nuisance by the
whites. Another plan is projected for erect
ing a sugar colony on the banks of the river
Gambia, in Africa, for which the fanftion
of the parliament is to be requeftedat their

The fame papers speak with much regret
of the continual emigrations of the English,
I rifh, and Scotch tradesmen and mechan
ics to this country. To prevent this ufe
ful class of men from reaping that due re
turn for their labours in a foreign land,
which their native foil has denied them, the
1110 ft severe laws have been enacted, mak
ing every person who is found any way con
cerned in persuading them away, liable to
a punishment little short of total loss of for
tune, and imprisonment for life. This be
ing the cafe in Britain, it is certainly the
duty of the public of the United States to
throw every encouragement in the way of
those patriotic societies which have been
instituted for the purpose of making the Ac
tuation of emigrants of this kind easy, upon
their arrival, and to put them forward in
their respective occupations.
At Newark, in New-Jersey, an academy

" From the whole tenor of intelligence
it appears, that the two great prepondera
ting powers of Germany will not give up
I theirprefent pacific plan, for any of those
uncertain profpefts that an invasion of
France in the spring, might seem to pro

is, the philosophical character of the Fmpe

Up from year to year with amusements and
harmless reviews at Potfdamâln refpeft to
the German princes, a coalition amongll
them can scarcely be expe&ed, conlidering
the unsettled principles that have always
influenced them, and their being obliged to
obey whatever impulse is given their coun
sels by the king of Pruflia and the emperor;
their united efforts, therefore, can only be
matter of contempt to such a power as
France. Where then shall we look for re
bels to the rights of man ? Perhaps it may
be said, in Sweden and Russia. The lofty
anddefpotic character of the king of Swe
den is well knownâand we also know that
he has 12,000 of his belt troops aflembled in
one of his southern provinces, which he
dares not to march out of his kingdom for
fear of intestine insurrections. âAs to the
heroine of the north, who fills the world
with the history of her devastations, her de
signs are beyond all doubt favorable to the
restoration ofdefpotifm; and the present
made to the French princes, it is said, was
only a prelude to a present of 18,000 men,
13 ships of the line, and a small fleet of fri
gates âto be sent to conquer 24 millions of
men, who have sworn to exist only under a
free government!âAs to the Island so
celebrated, the refidenceof philosophy
and the sciences, the classic land of liberty,
(as Mirabeau termed her) were she only to
make the attempt to restore the reign of
slavery in France, a volcano would burst
from her bosom to scorch into cinders the

scarcely worth while to mention the Can

A few Copies of the REPORT of
the Secretary of the Treasury, of the
6th inji. on the PUBLIC DEBT,
may be had at this Office.To the Yeomanry of the United States.
HAPPY for mankind, the present enquiry in
the pbilo fophical world is not the mechan
ilm of the universe, or the composition of its
elements, but the principles of civil society. The
prodigious advantages which Fiance has already
derived from these enquiries, and the alterations
which are daily taking place in other parts of Eu
rope in favor of the rights of man, ihould have
fame influence on the measures of the general go
vernment of the United States ; which are tend
ing in an alarming degree to undermine the liber
ties of our country ; to itrip the farmer, the
mechanic, the manufacturer, and the ufeful
laborer, of all influence and of all importance ;
to consign them to contempt, or at belt, to the
fad privilege of murmuring without redress.
The world has been fufticiently flooded with
the blood of its inhabitantsâand free citizens un
der the sanCtion of law have been too often
reduced to misery and wretchedivefs.
In this enlightened age let American rulers
beware how they proceed.âWhatever may be the
opinion of those characters living upon the spoils
of their fellow citizens, or balking in the sun
shine of court-favor, they will find a spirit of re
finance in the people which will not submit to
be opprefled, and a fund of good sense which
cannot be deceived by the arts ot falfe reasoning
or falfe patriotism.
Governments are tranquil when they are adapt
ed to the ideas and lights of the age : But when
ever their regulations become unfuitabJe to the
ideas of the times, and contrary co the opinion
of the people, the rulers /hould look into their
conduCt, and remove every reason of complaint.
All attempts to support unjust measures in this
country, where the people as yet, have so much
power, are absurd, and must ultimately be un
fuccefsful: juftica will finally take place in spite
of all effoits to suppress it.
The fame spirit of arbitrary power which du
ring the last year violated the rights of the great
body of yeomanry by an Excije Laio, now propo
ses to interfere in the occupations of the mecha
nic and manufacturer. A government may waste
the public money ill erecting palaces, statues,
&c. the evil is but temporary, but when it ajfumei
principles injurious to the rights of tht people t and
by arbitrary laws interferes in the occupations oi
its citizens, liberty is but a name. The theory
of such a government is falfehood and mockery j
the practice is oppreflion.
It may be thought improper at this early period
to offer any observations on the justice or wisdom
of the Report of the Secretary of the Treasury on
manufactures. 1c is true we might have waited
for the deliberations and conclusion of Congress
on the fubjeCt. But Congress having adopted a
new method of legislating, by referring the molt
important business of the country to the different
Secretaries, and adopting their reports, experience
juftifies a belief, that the principles of this report
will also be adopted, and will come forward
under the sanCtion of the legislature in the
form of a law. The Sectetary and his friends
in New-York have already prepared the way,
by procuring one of the most unjust: and ar
bitrary laws to be enaCted by the commonwealth
of New-Jersey, that ever difgraccd the govern
ment of a free people ; a law granting to a few
wealthy men the cxclufive jurisdiCtion of fix miles
square; and a variety of unconstitutional privileges,
highly injurious to the citizens of that state. This
Jaw merits your attention, not as a pattern of
justice, but to convince you how dangerous it is
for a free people to place their whole political
fafety on the conduCt of any set of legislators,
when surrounded by artful and designing men. Is
it reasonable, is it just, that a numerous class oi
citizens, whose knowledge in mechanics and ma
nufactures, not less neceflary for the support oi
their families, than ufeful to their country,
should be facrificed to a wealthy few, who have no
other objeCt in view than to add to their ill-gotten
and enormous wealth.
Such being the nature of this corporation, can
it be doubted whether it violates the spirit of all
just: laws? Whether it subverts the principles ol
that equality of which freemen ought to be fa
jealous ? Whether it eftabliihes a class of citizens
with distinCt interests from their fellow citizens ?
Will it not by foitering an inequality of
prove the destruCtion of the equality of rights
and tend firongly to an aristocracy ?
There are two kinds of inequality, the one
personalâthat of talent and virtue, the source oi
whatever is excellent and admirable in fociety---
The other that of fortune, which mult exist, be
cause property alone can stimulate to labor ; and
labor, if it were not neceflary to the existence ;
would be indifpenfible to the happiness of man :
But though it be neceflary, yet in its excess it is
the great malady of civil society. The accumu
lation of that power which is conferred by wealth
in the hands of the few is the perpetual fuurce ol
oppreflion and negleCt to the mass of mankind.
The power of the wealthy is farther concentrated
by their tendency to combination, from which,
number, dispersion, indigence, and ignorance,
equally preclude the poor. The wealthy arc
formed into bodies by their profeflions, their dif
ferent degrees of opulence, caHed ranks, theii
knowledge and their small numbers They ne
ceflarily in all countries administer government j
for they alone have /kill and leisure for its
funCti*>ns. Thus circumstanced, nothing can be
more evident than their inevitable preponderance
in the political scale. Ibe preference of partial tc
general inter ejis, is however the great eft of all pub
lic evils. It should, therefore, have been the
objeCt of all laws to repress this malady ; but it
has been their perpetual tendency to aggravate it.
Not content with the inevitable inequality of for
tune, they have fuperadded to it honorary and
political diftinCtions. Not content with the ine
vitable tendency of the wealthy to combine, they
have embodied them in clafles. They have forti
fied these conspiracies against the general interest,
which they ought to have refitted, though they
could not difaim. Laws, it is said, cannot equal
ize menâNo---But ought they for that reason
toâaggravate the inequality which they cannot
cure ? Laws cannot inspire unmixed patriotism j
but ought they for that reason to foment that
corporation fpirii wh'ch is its most fatal enemy ?
All p otVihonal combinations, said Mr. Buike,
in one of his late fpeches in Parliament, are dan
gerous in afreeftate. Arguing on the fame prin
ciple, the national assembly of France have pro
ceeded further : They have conceived that the
laws ought to crcatc no inequality or combina
rion, to recognize all onlyincheir capacities as
citizens, and to offer no alTiftance to the natural
preponderance of partial over general inrerelts.
It is not the diitinftions of titles which conftU
cute an aristocracy : it is the principle of partial
afl'ociation. The American aristocrats have fail
edin their attempt to eftjbliih titles cf diftindtions
by law; yet the deftrudtive principles ot ariltocra
cy are too prevalent amongst us, and ought to be
watched with the molt jealous eve.
A FARMER.
From the INDEPENDENT GAZETTEER.
[lnferted by defire.J
Mr. Oswald,
At a fiated meeting of the Germantoivn Society for
promoting domejtic Manufactures t the fo'uo'iving
paper ivas delivered by the Prefident 9 and di
rected to be publijbed.
Centlemen,
AT the last meeting of the society a resolution
was adopted, recommending to the mem
bers to procure the best information respeCting
rhe raising of Bees $ the society being of opinion
chat the profit and advantages to be derived from
this source ofdoroeftic riches merited foÂ»e at
tention.
It is a received opinion that the bee provides
itfdf with wax and honey from the flowers of
plants, therefore the number of bees whkh may
be kept to advantage in a neighborhood, must de
ipend on the quantum of pasture afforded by , the
surrounding fields. Whenever a particular dis
triCt: of country becomes overstocked, the bees
fuffer, and the quantity of wax and honey col
lected does not recompence the farmer for his at
tention. The ancients were so fenfibJe of this,
that Columella informs us, that as few places are
fp happily situated as to afford plenty of pasture,
it was the 2dvice of Celfus, that after the ver
nal pastures are consumed, the bees should be
transported to places abounding with autumnal
flowers, as was praCtised by conveying the ,bÂ£es
I from Achaia to Attica j and alio in Sicily,
where they were brought to Hybla from the other
parts of the island. Maillet, in his curious des
cription of Egypt, relates that one of their moll
admirable contrivances, is their fending their
bees annually into distant countries, in order to
procure them j afture at a time when they could
not find any at home, and afterwards bringing
them back, like shepherds who travel with their
flocks, and make them feed as they go. The hives
are placed in a boat prepared for the purpose :
After they have remained some days at their Jar
theft station, and are supposed to have gathered
all the wax and honey they could find in the fields
within two or three leagues around, their con
ductors convey them in the fame boats two or
three leagues lower down the river. The author
of the Natural History of Bees gives the Allowing
account of what is praCTlfed in this way in France :
M. Proutau, fays he, keeps a great number of
hives j his situation is one of those in which
flowers are very soon scarce, and where few or
none are seen after the corn is ripened. He then
fends his bees into Beauce, or the Gatinois. This
is a journey of twenty miles ; the hives are pla
ced on a cart, and removed with great care.
As it is more than probable that the members
of this society will not think it proper to remove
their hives in order to procure palture for their
bees, it is necefiary that the number of hives kept
should be in proportion to the pasture afforded by
the neighborhood $ a little experience and obser
vation would soon ascertain this point J when
every neighbor confining himfelf to his propor
tion, the raising of bees might be carried on tc
the advantage of all.
I have conversed with several elderly men whe
have been attentive to bees for forty or fifty years.
They fay the raising of bees is not attended with
the success of former years j and that is owing tc
the want of pasture for these valuable infeÂ£ts.
Straw hives are preferable to any other habita
tions, hecaufe the straw is not as liable to be
heated by the rays of the fun 5 and is a better
lecurity against the cold than any kind cf wood.
The form and fafhion of the common straw hive
is fufiiciently known, but they are often made
too high for their width. The best size is such
as would hold about fix gallons. Whoever makes
use of straw hives should at all times have them
well secured from the inclemency of the weather,
by means of a substantial straw cap j which nol
only preserves the bees from wet, than which no
thing is more injurious, but also preserves the
hive in a more equal temperature, during the se
verity of summer heats and winter colds.
A variety of opinions have been entertained
respeCting the situation and form of an apiary $
experience has pointed out the most simple plan
to be the best. It is now generally allowed, that
the best situation for a hive of bees, is on a stool,
raised about two feet from the ground, and placed
not exadtly level, but a little slanting, that rhe
water which falls on the stool may not incom
mode the bees. If the straw cap is properly form
ed ic will extend over the edges of the stool and
prevent any such injury.
The latter end of August, or the beginning ol
September, the combs are fulleft of honey. This
points out the proper season for taking it. The
old way is to killthe beesâbuc many methods have
been recommended for taking the honey without
destroying the infeCt. 1 attempted this new plan,
and injured my stock of bees. Mr. George Shoe
maker and Mr. Lukin9, who have had great ex
perience in raising of bees, met with no better
success both these gentlemen prefer the old me
thod of destroying them. There can be no great
purpose answered in preserving the bees when their
food is taken away 5 for in these circumftances,they
frequently require more care and attention ithan
the .farmer can bestow to preserve them frorrj pe
rishing. The practice of killing the bees when
)ou take their wax and honey, is not so cruel as it
Â»av appear on the firft view co persons- of great
humanity. The life of che bee's natural!, but
Jiort, and with the Lj managecnent they mult
pass but an i ncomfortible waiter after they
robbed their ( irovr -n.
We have not it neccffary to take no
tice of the natural hitiory, or the economy of the
bee. We may just obfftrve, that the hive is a
2'chool, to which numbers of people ought to be
sentâprudence, industry, benevolence, public fpi
ritednefs, economy, neatnel's and temperance, are
all visible among the bees. These little animals
are all actuated by a social spirit, which fornix
them into a body politic, intimately united, ana
perfectly happy. They all labour for the general
advantage ; having no partial interest, no felfifn
diftindtion to support, they are happy because the
concurrence of their several labours inevitably
produces abundance, which contributes to the
riches of each individualâLet us compare human
societies to this, and they will appear altogether
rrionftrous. Neceliity, reason and philoiophy,
have eftablilhed them for the commendable purpo
fas of mutual aid and benefits } but a spirit of
felfifhnefs deltroys all ; and one half of mankino
to load themselves with fuperfluities, leave the
other destitute of common neceflaries.
ExtraEl of an original letter, written from theinju
iar Weft-Indies*
tc Perhaps there is no in nature more
beautiful than a Planter's country-leal in the Wef
t iilands, where the several improvements and
ornamental appendages have been directed by a
man of taste. The trees and shrubs of the tropi
cal climates have a peculiar afpedl for beauty,
contributing at firft glance to excite thole roman
tic ideas of philosophical solitude and rural feli
city, which a native of the more nojthern parts cf
the world has imbibed from fidiion only. â I was
not long since, invited to a sugar plantation to
pass the night and part of the succeeding day.
The importunity of the owner, and his affedted
anticipation of the pleasure that could not fail to
attend the excursion, was my principal motive for
accepting the invitation.
In approaching to what I had been led to sup
pose a terrestrial paradise, my fatisfadtion was con
siderably abated, on the way, by the negro boy
who had been sent with the horse for my accom
modation. It is almost universally the custom in
these iilands for the attendant to follow the horse
on foot. Jf )ou travel too fa ft for him to keep on
an even pace with you, (which he is obliged to do
at his peril) he twirls a wisp of the horlie's tail
about his fore finger, and by this means is, as it
were, in 'addition to his own exertions, towed
along by the horse, some times at the rate of ten
miles an hour.
Before reaching the mansion house, I patted
through a small village of negroes belongingto the
plantationânot a cheerful look could I observe
amongst the wretched inhabitants, except from
some naked children who had not yet come to a
fenfeof the misery of their condition. âThe im
perial buildings (as I may call them) were small,
but neat, convenient, and numerous, surrounded
by and intermingled with a vast number of beauti
ful trees and rtitubt, foma ihem of ihe aroma
tic kind, which, with the profpeft of distant hills,
vallies, plains covered with sugar canes two thirds
grown, and beyond ail, the immense and orbicular
ocean, formed alcenewhich for rural beauty and
magnificence, could not, 1 am certain, be exceed
ed in either of the Indies.
Every thing on a Weil-India plantation wears
the severe afpedi of delpotifm. Thfc tyranny, that
originates with the master proceeds through every
grade of the black domestics, and each becomes a
tyrant in his tura to those over whom chance or
merit gives him a momentary direction. All in
authority go constantly armed with a whip, which
is applied on the moll trifling occasions with an
unfeeling heart and hand.âDo the young ladies
wish to have a sociable family dance, and a petit
use ?âThe negro fiddler, commonly a tall young
tellow, perhaps nineteen or twenty years of age, is
called in. He makes some blunder in playing a
marchâa severe whipping about the naked iegs is
the sure consequence, as well as .being obliged to
undergo the mortification of returning thanks in
form to the master and mistress of the house for
every stroke infiidted. This is common to all the
Englifli lilands.âl was awaked soon after day
light, in the morning, by the cries of the molt
pungent and agonizing distress, which continued
something more than a quarter of an hour. Up
on enquiry, after rising, 1 found these cries pro
ceeded from about a dozen slaves, who had some
time before ran away, were afterwards appre
hended, put in the dungeon, fed on little else than
water and a scant allowance of potatoes, and had
been sentenced to receive, each, thirty la/hes every
morning for a week. About an hour after, I had
the misfortune to fee these objects j they were
chained together by the neck, employed in carry
ing stones and lime to a new building, appeared
horribly mangled, starved, and nakedâtheir legs
swollen to an enormous size, from a failure of the
dodfcor in extracting the Guinea worm ; their feet
devoured with an infedt called a chiggcr j and, in
fadl, altogether constituting a growpe of human
wretchedness beyond any thing ic was ever my lot
to behold before.
A negro-man was soon after brought to the
house, who had been caught in one of the cane
fields cutting a cane. He confefled the fadfr,
but allured the planter, his master, it was solely
committed to gratify the gnawings of an empty
stomach, the overseer having that mÂ®rning refufed
him his allowance, because he came five minutes
too late. âHe was ordered twenty-five la/hes, well
laid on, to warn him how to transgress in future
with a view to alleviate the cravings of hunger.
In northern countries the crack of a whip, even
from a horse driver, is not always accompanied
with the idea of a stroke infilled at the fame
time, on the animal substance. Here, however,
except at the morning alarm, you may be sure it is
| the token of anguish, hear it when you will ;
which is frequently to the distance of three miles
âand once I recoiled*, diftindtty to have heard a
cart-whipping from St. Kirts to St. Euftatia, over
a channel near three leagues wide.
Not to mention several other difagreeab'.e inci
dents of the fame kind as those above, which are
eorrftar.f.'.y faking place on a Weft-India sugar
i iirm, a Itranger v. no c ides in these illands will
fin.i thiii. fiageJa ,s .ts constant as the day*
and may be called the creature or the whole year"
round. Jt is thought iuperfluous to address t-he
realon pr underftanamgs of ignorant barbarians;
and the owner ot this beautiful plantation assured
me, that it hz were to relax but a single week of
his uiual severe discipline, if he were only to seem
the man of /ympathy or pity ; if the Haves were
not made to feel the mod excruciating torments
upon the flighted infringement of his laws, he
and his family would not reft a (ingle night with
out the mod serious danger of having their throat*
cut j or if this did not actually happen, their
be wafted, ruined and embezzled
by their unprincipled domestics.
" It io, replied 1, may heaven deliver me from
ever owning a sugar plantation on this fide the
tropic ! If this fatal sweet wuji be had, let us ra
ther retire to the tore lis of the north, where it is
extra&ed from the sugar maple by the hands of
freedom and innocence. We may there pofiefs
this luxury without a crime ; without steeling the
heart against every feeling of nature and metamor
phosing man into a monlter."
The peculiar.mifcry attending such a rural life
as that I have be.en describing is not a little affect
ing to a foieigner, and all iuch as have not become
unfeeling despots from habits of custom, The
[hades and charming profpe&s of the iilands bring
to mind the innocence of the firft men of the earth,
contrasted with the view of avarice, cruelty, and
tortures every moment inflidted on unfortunate
victims, in addition to poverty, llavcry, and the
severest of all labour.
I returned on a flow walk to the sea port, with
the horse and negro boy, who had before attended
me. Upon alighting, he afiured me I was the
firft man he had ever known, who had been fa
merciful as not to oblige him to follow the horse,
if noton a gallop, at leati on a brisk fix mile trot! '*
