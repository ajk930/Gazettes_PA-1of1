POPULATION and EMIGRATION.
BOTH in the vegetable and animai
kingdoms, every species- derives
from nature, a reprodu&ive faculty be
yond the demand for merely keephii
up its.stock : the feed of a fingje plan
is fufficient to multiply it one hundrec
or a thousand fold. The animal oft
spring is never limited to the number o
its parents*. -
This ordinance of nature is calculated
in both instances, for a double purpose
in both, it enlures the life of the fpe
c:es, which, if the generative principl
had not a multiplying energy, would b
reduced in number by every prematur
deftruttion of individuals, and by de
grees would be extinguished altogether
In the vegetable species, the surplus an
fwers, moreover, the eifential purpof*
of luftaining the herbivorous tribes o
animals ; as in the animal, the lurplu
serves the like purpose of fuftcnance t<
the carnivorous tribes. A cropof whea
may be reproduced by one teiuh of it

It is either, iff. destroyed by Â»faiÂ»ti

monians ; or 2d. it is ftifled or starved
as among other nations whose 1 opuia
tion is commensurate to its food ; or 3d
it is cor.fumedby wars and endemic dis
eases ; or 4th. it oveiflows, by emigrati
on, to places where a surplus of Â±ood is
attainable.
What may be the greatest ratio of :n
---creafe of which the human species is
susceptible, is a problem difficult to be
solved ; as well because precise experi
ments have never been made, asbecaule
the result would vary with the circum
stances diltinguilhing different situati
ons. It has been computed that under
the most favorable circumstances pos
sible, a given number would double it
felf in ten years. What has actually
happened in this country is a prOof, that
nature would require for the pYnpole,
a less period than twenty years. We
{hall be Cafe in averaging the surplus at
five per centt.
According to this computation, Great
Britain and Ireland, which contain a
bout ten millions of people, are capable
of producing annually for emigration,
no lei's than five hundred thousand ;
France, whose population amounts to
twenty-five millions, no less than one
million two hundred and fifty thouiand ;
and all Europe, (fating its numbers at
one hundred and fifty millions, no less
than seven and a half millions.
It is not meant that such a surplus

stances, suddenly take place : yet no
reason occurs why an annual supply of
human, as well as other anirtal life, to
any amount not exceeding the multi
plying faculty, would rot be producec
in One country, by a regular and com
menfurate demand of another. Nor i:
it meant that if such a redundancy o
population were to happen in any parti
cular country, an influx of it beyond <
certain degree ought to be delired bv ast)
nher, though within that degree, i
ought to be invited by a country great
y deficient in its population. The cal
:ulation may serve, nevertheless, b\
placing an important principle in a flrik
ng view, to prepare the way forthe sol
owing positions and reinanks.
First. Every country, whose popula
ion is full; may annually spare a porti
m of its inhabitants, like a hive of bee:
ts swarm, without any diminution o
is number : nay, a certain portion mull
leceffarily, be either spared, ordeftroy
d, or kept out of exiltencet.
Secondly. It follows, moreover, frou
his multiplying faculty of human na
me, that in a nation, sparing or loiins
noire than its proper surplus, the leve
nuft soon be reflored by the internal re
ources of life.
Thirdly. Emigrations may even a g
herit the population of the country per
ratting them. The commercial nation:
>f Europe, pal ling with emigrants, u
\tnerica, are examples. The article:
ifconfumption demanded from the form
:r, have created employment for an ad
iitional number of man <xrafturers. Thi
jroduce remitted from the latter, in th<
orm of raw materials, has had the sam
:fieftâwhilft the imports and export
>f every kind, have multiplied Europe
.n merchants and maiincrsi Wheretin
ettlers have doubled every twenty 01
wenty-five years, as in the Unitei
itates, the encreafe of products and con
umption in the new country, and con
equently of employment and people ir
he old, has had a corresponding. rapi
lity.
Of the people of the United States
learly three millions are of British def
:ent||. The British population has not
vithftanding Increaf'ed within the peri
od of oureftablifhment. It was the opi
lion of the famous fir Jofiah Child, thai
:very man in theÃritifh colonies fount
â inployment, and of courl'e, Cubfiften.ce
or four persons at home. According
o this eftirnate, as more than half i
nillion of the adult males in the United
itates equally contribute employment
it this time to British fuhjefts, there
nuft at this time be more tiian two mil
ions of British iubjefts subsisting o:
he fruits of British emigrations. Thi:
efult, however, f'eems to be beyend the
eal proportion. Let us attempt a lei:
/ague calculation.
The value of British imports into the
United States including British ireight
may be ftaied at about fifteen millions o
dollars. Deduct two millions for fo
cign articles coming through Britifl
lands ; there remain thirteen millions
About half ourexpoits, valued at ter
millions of dollars, are remitted to thai
nation. From the nature of the articles
the freight cannot be less than three mil
lions of dollars : or which about on<

This is Jatedas the fad is, not as it outfit,
be. The United Slates are r , >ul : \' cntUxd t\
half tl: freight, if under regul.it,ans rrkctly vc
ciprocai in every chann i oi navigation, the
â ould acquire that share. According to' IjrdSh'f
field, indeed, the i r.-ted States are mill rjf, cimpem
;d ui'ti: â 'â  her ,atwus ; the ton'r.> e r- thi
States, there is to be added to the form
er remainder, two millions four hun
dred thousand. The profit accruing
from the articles as materials or auxili
aries for manufactures, is probably.at
lea $'fifty' per cent, or five millions or
dollirs?. The three sums make twen
ty rrullions four hundred thbufand dol
lars . call them in round numbers twfen
tv millions.âThe expence of support
ing a labouring family in Gteat-Britain,
>>s computed by Sir John Sinclair,on fix
families containing thirty-four persons,
averages Â£ : 12: 10 | sterling, or about
twenty dollars a head. As his families
were! of the poorer class, and the subsist
ence a bare competency, let twenty-five
per cent, be added, making the expence
about twenty five dollars a head, divid
ing" twenty millions by this sum, we
have eight hundred thousand for the
number of British persons whose subsist
ence may be traced to emigration for its
f'out-ce : or allowing eight (hillings ster
ling a week, for the support of a work
in:; man, we have two hundred sixteen
thousand three hundred forty-five of
that class, for the number derived from
the fame source.
This lelfon of faÂ£t, which merits the
no'ice, of every commercial nation, may
be enforced by a more general view of
tir.- fubjeft.
The present imports of the United
States, adding to the firft cost, &c. one
half the freight as the reasonable (hare
o'.'foreign nations, may beft.rtcd at twen
ty-five millions of dollars. Deducting
five millions on account of Eaft-Iridra
articles, there remain in favour of Eu
rope, twenty millions of dollars. '1 he
fejeign labour incorporated with such
tyj-t of our exports as arc fubje&s or in
fWHSfts - for nianufa&ures, together
with half the export freight, is proba
bly not of less value than fifteen millions
of dollars. The two sums together malic
thirty-five millions of dollars, capable
as lupporting two hundred thirty-three
thousand three hundred thirty-three fa
milies of fix persons in each : or three
hundred feventy-eightthoufand iix hun
dred and five men, living on eight fhil
tings sterling a week.
The share of this benefit, which eacli
nation is to will be determined
jy many circumflances. One that must
lave a certain and material influence,
will be, the taste excited here sos their
refpeclive products and fabrics. This
nftuence has been felt in all its forec
nythe commerce of Great-Britain, as
;he advantage originated hrthe emigra
tions from that country to this ; among
he means of retaining it, will not be
lumbered a restraint on emigrations.
Dther nations, who have to acquire their
hare in bur commerce, are still more
nterefted in aiding their other efforts,
3V permitting, and even promoting em
it/rations to this country, as fact as it
nay be disposed to welcome themw Ihe

twenty thousand. And in tne nreau
time, example and information will be

Fourthly. Freedom 6f emigration is
due to the general interests of humani
ty. The fcourfe of emigrations being
tlwayS, from places where living ismoic
difficult, to places where it is less difli
;uit, the happiness of the! emigrant is
promoted by the change : and as a more
mmeroui progeny is another effect of
.lie fame cause, human life is at once
nade a greater blelling, and more indi
viduals are created to partake of it.
The annual expence of fuppoftiftg the
lo'or in England amounts to more than
;ne million and a half (lerling.* The
lumber of persons, subsisting themselves
lot more than lix months in the year, is
romputeu at one million two hundred
;xty eight thousand, and the number of
DCggars at forty eight thousand. In
France', it has been computed that seven
millions of men women and children
ive one with another, on twenty-five
ivres, which is less than live dollars a
Every benevolent reader will'
nake his Own reflections.
Fifthly. It may not be fuperfluous to
idd, that freedom of emigration is fa
vorable to morals, A great proportion
>f the vices which distinguish crouded
from thin fettlemenrs, are known to
nav'e their rife in the facility of illicit
ntercQurfe between the fcxes, on one
band; and the difficulty of maintaining
i family, on the other, l rovide an out
let for the fufplus of population, and
marriages will be increased in propor
tion. Every four or five emigrants will
be the fruit of a legitimate union which
would not otherwise have taken place.
Sixthly. The remarks which have
yeen made, though in many refpectts little
ippliCable to tiie internal lituation of the
United States, maybe of ufeasfar asthey
:end to prevent :*iftaken and narrow
deas 011 an important fubjett. Our
tountry being populated in clific rent de
;rees in different parts of it, removals
rom the more compact to the more Ipare
>r vacant diftri&s are continually, going
orwardâTheobje&of thefc removalsii
tvidently to exchange a less easy tor a
noreeafv subsistence. The dictt of them
nufttherefore be to quicken the aggiv
;ate population ofour country. Confid

THURSDAY, November 17.
Cornelius C. Schoonmaker, fron
New-York, and Thomas Hartley fron
Pennsylvania appeared and took thci
feats.
Petitions were read from Lewis An
derfon, Thomas Carhartt, Philip Green
wait, William Loring, and Davu
Welsh, refpeftively praying compenfa
tion, for services rendered, &c. in th<
army of the United States during th'
war.âReferred to the Secretary a
War.
Mr. Gerry, from Massachusetts, an<
Mr. Findley, from Pennsylvania, wer
reported duly elected members of th l
House.
According to the order of the day
the House resolved itfelf into a commit
tee of the whole on the bill " Direftin
the mode in which certain evidence
of the debt of the L T nited States, whicl
have been loft , or destroyed, may be re
ncwed."
A motion was then made by Mi
Sedgwick for striking out the word
loft or, as he thought that in cases o
loft certificates the public ought to b
better secured, than they are in the mod
pointed out in the bill.
Mr. Smith (N.H.) Messrs. Wadfwortli
Hillhoufe, Giles and Barnwell, were al
for striking out, upon the general prin
ciple of impracticability and public in
convenience in renewing loft certifi
cates so as not to iubjcS; the public t
frauds from the holders. The paffin:
a law of renewal, would also (in the opi
nion of Mr. Hillhoufe) be holding fort]
an encouragement to negligence in th
potfeffors of certificates.
Mr. Laurence, tho't the provision
made in the bill were fufficient. Th
publifhingan accurate description of th
loft certificate, he said, would enabl
the officer to discover whether such cer
tificate had been really ilfued ; and i
fufficient security was given to refunc
the money to the United States, in cafi
of recovering the loft certificate, he di<
not fee how the public could fuffer fron
any law providing for a renewal of fuel
a species of paper.
The question was taken oh the moti
on for striking out, and palled in th<
affirmative.
Mr. Muhlenberg reported that twe
other amendments had been made to thi
bill, extending the time for the renew
al and issuing of the certificates ; upoi
which the House proceeded to take th<
feid amendments into consideration, anc
made lome progrefsl therein, when ar
adjournment Was called for, previous t<
taking the question.
Adjourned.

and seven days service of an apprentice
enlisted into the continental artillery.â
Also, a petition of John Hafkill, pray

the Secretary of the Treasury.
A petition was then read from the
branch pilots of Pennsylvania, New
Jerley, and Delaware, plying in Dela

A melTage from the Senate by Mi
Otis:
" Mr. Speaker,
1 am directed by the Senate to brin
to this House a letter received by th
President of the Senate from the Prefi
dent of the Aflembly of the French Cc
lony of-St. Domingo, to the Congress c
the United States."âWhich was order
ed to lie on the table.
A letter was then laid before th
House from the Treasurer of the Unite
States, inclosing his indent account c
interejl received and lll'ued by him froi
July l, to September 30. 1791.
The House then resumed the confidei
ation of the amendments reported froi
the committee of the whole'Houfe, t
the bill directing the mode in which th
evidence of the debt of the United State
which have been lojl or dejlroyed shall b
renewed.
Mr. Lee thought there fhouldbe fom
provision made for lofl certificates ; ur
der which denomination, however, h
would include only fucli as should ay
pear upon the strongest evidence to hav
been actually destroyed. The
being thus explicit, would at once b
understood, and no man would be at th
trouble of making useless application
for renewal. He wilhed the wor
dejlroyed to be omitted altogether, an
the word lojl only retained, with a claul
in the bill, that certificates were onl
renewable upon the strongest prefumj:
tive evidence of their having been lo:
[or destroyed.]
M r. S e d c w 1 c k insisted that the Hc*l!
had no right to define what species c
evidence should establish a fact. If the
could do it in this instance. they coul
also in every other, and by that mean
involve the whole legal code in obfci
rity.
Mr. Clarke argued that the condui
of the House in refpe& to the proviiio
contemplated, was unprecedented, es
cept in one instance, when a forme
Congress, during the war, did the fan?
thing. A reason might then iiave bee
given which at present would be abl'ur
to urge. In the time of war, the deval
tations and conflagrations of the enem
destroyed public securities every wher
in the houses of individuals, and to kee
up the spirit of the people it feeme
necefiary fonCongrefs to indulge ther
with renewals of papers thus destroy
ed. Matters being upon a different foot
ing at present, he wilhed to fee no pro
vision made, whatever.
Mr. KitcheLl preferred the won
dejlroyed to the word lofl. He was again'
eftablilhing any general rule in cases o
renewing destroyed certificates, am
rather wished the House to enquire am
form an opinion from the circumstance
of each, individually.
Mr. Gerry was against palling th<
bilLin its present form, as being liabL
in its consequences, to fraud, perjury
ind every species of abuse. In order t<
ilcertain faÂ£fs, it would be ncoelTary tha
he claimants should have recourse ti
public records. Hence a fraudulen
peculator might discover what certi
kates were loft, and lay plans for reco
/ering them. During the war, man'
public officers had loft certificates, th
imount of which was afterwards allow
:d. It would now be impossible toiden
ify such certificates. Many publi
ecurities were also wantonly deftroyei
>y the enemies of the revolution, in th<
ime of the war, whose value was neve
:nown. It was therefore impossible t(
ell what lengths the bill would go it
nvolving the United States in a new
lebt.
Several other gentlemen having fpok
n on this fubjett, the question was pu;
hat the said bill with the amendmcn
be engrofTed and read the third time-
It palled in the negative.
Mr. Livermore, from the committe
of ele&iojis, made a report on the lette
from the executive of Maryland, rela

and a certificate of the election of John

Pinkney t which was readâOrdered to

A memorial was presented from the

United States, stating the inadequacy ol
their pay, subsistence and forage, under

Mr. Ames made a report from the

The following Letter is addrefled to thi
Government of the United States
and is entitled,
" A Political Enquiry into the bejl Means o
improving the Commerce of the
American States."
[ Translated for the Naiional Gaxette, from th
original French manuscript of the Author, da
ted Ntiv-L ridnr, May jy, 1791.]
Having taken a view of the envi
able iituation of the America]
States at the present period, and con
fidered in all its branches that free am
virtuous government under which th
people live; a government no less wil
in its principles than the adminiftra
tion of it is honorable to the magiftra
cv, 1 could not help thinking that f
promising an outset tnuft be fucceede*
by ages of peace and felicity in thi
country. âWith a view of applying nr
observations to the United States, I hav'
made some reiearch into the histories o
palt tunes, to discover, if possible, thei
methods of improvement, not only ii
the cultivation and production of th
rude materials, which go towards flip
porting the various manufactures in use
but alio in those subordinate arts am
trades, which when fufficiently follow
ed and encouraged here, will be ad
vanced to the highest possible degree o
perfection.
In purluing this fubjea, I shall en
deaVour to explain what is the genera
interest of America, as a nation ; am
shall hkewife take into view the politi
cal iyftems ot leveral thriving nations ii
Europe ; and from hence deduce, in par
ticular, the secret motives and lpring
or action in the Hritijh government.
If we cast our eves but for a momen
on what is tranfafting in Europe, W (
(hall at once fee, that the attention o:
all nations is fixed, more than at
former period, upon the great object:
ot commerce, which are justly conii
dered the true sources of nationa
profpenty and the splendor of crowns
in this convitlion, they would indivi
clually make immense in or

certain lolid advantages, which thev arc

terelt is evermore uppermost in theii
minds and the ardour of patriotifir
ipurs them on to employ every active
power, and all the address possible, tc
bring about purposes founded in the
deepest abylfes of state policy. Some
times every possible scheme is laid tc
render abortive the united interests anc
growing industry of a rival nation ; a
other times, they are unweariedly bem
upon throwing obstacles in the way o
foreign eftabhffiments, for the sole pur

this y /eft - Indla trad Â« ; and such, a,

jreat-Britain, in refpeft to the United
states of America.
We cannot doubt for a single mo

To eagle-eyed to whatever concerns its
>wn interest) forefeeing that a ftagna
ion of their commerce will most cer
ainly ensue, from the increasing manu
raÂ£lures of this country, will conftant
y feel itfelf disposed to facrifice some
>f their less important national inter
â fls, in order to damp the spirit of en
erprize and manufacture, in their ri
/als. If they can only contrive todif
learten and ruin those that firji attempt
nanufaftures in America, by putting
m inferior price upon the rival articles
ent from Britain, they will by degrees
persuade the Americans, that manufac
uring in this country is a hopeless pro
eft, or attended with insurmountable
difficulties. The effect of this perfua
ion will be, that future artisans, fear
ing the fate of their predecessors, will
either leave the country, or employ
'hemfelves in callings of a different na
ture!
This purpose being aceomplifhed,
England may at once consider herfelf
the sole manufacturer for America, and
triumph over every other obstacle, in
the fame manner, as heretofore in Por
tugal, when with all imaginable dexte
rity she possessed herfelf of their com
merce, and a great part of the treasures
Df Brazil, which are to this day conti
nually pouring into London, by a trade
advantageous to England, but ruinous
io the Portuguese. In the fame manner,
1 fay, will England exert her powers of
activity in inundating this country with
her various fabrics, but at the lame time
draining their ready money from tho
United States, who, to fatisfy the con
lequent demands of the British mer
chants, must be, in fact, under the ne
cefiitv of paying the nation a fort of tri
bute. and which, in reality, is now paid
in our being compelled, to purchase the
most common articles of neceflity from
them.
And thus it is, that, with a fingls
dafli of his pen, a British minister can
determine the commercial fate of a na
tion, and render tributary and depend
snt, a people in the bosom of liberty
itfelf. The picture is, indeed, diftreff
tng, but would be much more so, did
lot the Americans possess within them
selves the means effectually to prevent
:he baneful conferences I have hinted
it. I therefore think it of some mpor
ance to dwell a little upon this subject,
'nd, if poflible, withdraw that veil of
darkness which seems to conceal the na
ional interests of the United States
rom themselves.

In confluence of several definitive fires thai
have recently happened in New-York, the com
mon council of that city have revised their lay
refpeftmg fires, and among other additiona
clauses, ordained, under panalty of severe fines
that in future no hay orftraw fliall be depofitet
in buildings within the city, other than luch a
are ofbrick or flone, and covered with tile o
slate ; the neglect of such a precaution having
it is thought, been the principal cause of the ma
ny serious losses occasioned by the breaking ou
of fires in that capital.
In the new (hip Delaware buile for Meflrs
Hazlehurft and Co. of this city, an improvemen
is' made in the manner of (leering. The whee
commonly made use of, aÂ£ts upon a rope whicf
communicates motion to the rudder. I his rop<
is liable to wear and break, especially whenmofl
wanted in rough weather ; besides, it, by working
for a short time, stretches and gets flack ; thi:
proves a great inconvenience in bad weather
when the aclion of the rudder is necc(f3ry tt
keep the vessel out of the trough of the sea ; a:
sometimes in this cafe, the wheel must perforir
a considerable revolution before it acts upon tilt
rope and consequently the rudder. I hele in
conveniences are obviated in the new conUrufct
ed rudder on board the America. Ihe whee
moves an axis to which a caff-iron wheel o
much fmallerdimenfions, with cogs is fixed -
â i his cogged wheel consequently revolves wits
the largei one, to which the force is applied, ane
acts in its turn upbn a ftgment of a circle witl
correfpondicg cogs. The segment by mean.
of iron bars as radii, is conire&ed w th the bead
of the rudder to which it communicates the mo

" Whoever has read the ancient history o

for the present revolt of the Negro barbarians ii

The SPEECH and OATH of the
KING OF THE FRENCH.
spoken in the National Assembly, on the 14th
September, 1791.
For the Acceptation of the Constitution,
Gentlemen,
I COIVIE here solemnly to confirm the accept â¢
ance I have given to the constitutional ad.âl
swear to'be faithful to the nation and to the laws,
and to employ all the power which is delegated to
me to the maintaining the constitution decreed by
the constituent national assembly, and causing the
laws to be executed. May this great and memo
rable era, be that of the re establishment of peace
and unity, and become the pledge of the happi
ness of the people, and of the prosperity of the
?mpire.
After the King had fubferibed the oath, the presi
dent made the following answer.
Inveterate abuses which had long triumphed
aver the good intentions of our best kings, and
which would still have continued to defy the au
thority of the throne, kept France under oppref
(ion.
The national assembly, entrusted with the wifh
*s, the rights and the power of the people, has,
by the deftru&ion of all abuf*es, re established the
solid foundations of public prosperity.
Sire, what the national assembly has decreed,
is ratified by the content of the people ; the mÂ«ft
complete execution in all the parts of the empire,
attests the general assent. It defeats the weak
khemes of these whom discontent has toÂ® long
rendered blind to their own interests. It promif
ssto your majesty, that you will no longer wifli
in vain lor the happiness of the French.
The national aflembly has nothing more to wish
for on this ever memorable day, wherein you
consummate in the midst of them, the mod so
lemn engagementâthe acceptation of the consti
tutional royalty. It is the attachment of the
French-âit is their confidence which confers upon
yon this pure and refpedtable title to the faireft
:rown in the universe ; and that which fecurcs it
to you, is, fire, the inexhaustible authority of a
:onftitution freely decreed : it is the invincible
strength of a people, who has felt itfelf worthy of
liberty: it is the want of hereditary monarchy
which will always be indifpenfible to such a great
nation.
When your majesty, expe&ing from experi
ence the light it will throw upon the practical re
sults of the constitution, promises to maintain it
within and defend it against enemies from with
out,the nation relying on the justice of their rights,
and on the consciousness of their own strength and
courage, as well as on the earnestness of your co
operation, cannot fee any ground of alarm from
without, and will concur by its quiet confidence
in the quick success of its internal government.
How great to our eye 9, dear to our heart?, and
bow sublime will appear in our history, the era
jf this regeneration, which gives citizens to
Franceâa country to the French; to you as a
King, a new source of enjoyment and new fenfa
:lolls of happiness.
