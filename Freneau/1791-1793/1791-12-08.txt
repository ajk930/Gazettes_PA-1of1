ON the establishment of the federal
government, it was reasonably ex
peCted by the free citizens of America
that they would find that protection tc
their general and individual interests
tvnicii it is the duty of government tc
render : Nor did any man suppose that
immediately upon its organization, oni
of the fir ft Sits of the adminiftratior
thereof would be to enforce the obliga
t:ons of a treaty mutually obligatory up
on the contracting parties, and which
having been lhamefully and avowedl\
infra&ed by one party, could no longe
be deemed binding on the other. 1
will be seen, that I allude to the cogni
2ance which the federal courts have ta
lien, and the decision they are about t<
give on the subjeCt of British debts, ir
the event of which, as I conceive, th<
dignity, peace, and fafety of the go
vernment greatly depends: And altho
those courts, ftcm the terms and man
ner of their institution, Cannot avpic
to meet the question, whenever it i:
brought before them, yet surely a noto
rious public infraction of the treatv or
the part of Great-Britain, and that too,
in the instance of with-holdmg public
and private property, should have in
duced such a proceeding on the part of
the present government, for obtaining
indemnity for this infraction, as would
have kept equal progress with the
claims of British creditors in our courts
of law, or, in cafe of refufal or delay
of such indemnity, a like refufal or ful
pienfion of the recovery of BritiÂ£h debts.
It may perhaps be alledged, that the
ligation of the government hitherto,
and the dubious terms of the constitu
tion, as to the competent power for de
claring an infraction of the treaty; on
the part of Great-Britain, have delay
ed such a proceeding : it may be lb; but
surely a farther delay for this cause
Vill argue a disinclination, and not a
power to demand and obtain justice.
The power to make the declaration I
have mentioned, certainly exilts; nor
is it to be supposed that a longer delay
will be patiently acquiesced in ; for al
ready in one state (and that an impor
tant one) is the public mind awakened,
the public voice exerted, and the mea
i'ureof equaljultice and full protection
demanded, on behalf of its abused and
injured citizens. Perhaps the patient
fuftering of this people hitherto, may
be misconstrued by some into an admil
lion of the truth of that common bul
iniftaken suggestion, that the payment
of the private debts, due from the indi
viduals of one country to those of thf
other, has no relation to that infraCtior
of the treaty on the part of Great-Bri
tain, which is complained of. Ii
cannot, however, be forgotten, thai
this suggestion has been fully and pub
licly refuted by the conduCt and decla
ration of both the contracting parties :
by the former Congrels in the mftruc
tioas to their ministers at the court ol
London, which produced so long, te
dious, and ineffectual a negociation on
the subjeCt, on theii part ; and by the
court of London, in the well-known
animadversions made by the marquis ol
Carmarthaen, on the existing laws of
the several states respeCting the recove
ry of British debts, and in which it
was ultinfately avowed, that the impe
diments to a recovery, which those laws
had created, and the well-known im
becility of Congress under the powers
of the then existing government, to en
force the execution of the treaty on
their part, were a fufficient juftification
to Great-Britain for with-holding a
compliance on its part. The recol
leCtion of these facts, therefore, will
be fufficient to juftify the conduCt
of the state to which I have alluded,
which demands that the policy of the
Britilh court Ihould be retorted upon

them, by with-holding a compliance
with the treaty on our part, so far as
refpefts the recovery of BritiQi debts,
until adequate reparation be made for
with-holdjng the western posts, and for
the value of the slaves carried off ; and
it is aimoft fuperfluous to add, that
th is example of the British, in holding
fact a security for our performance,
should be followed by us in holdinq
fact this only security for a performance
on theirs, until in the course of future
negociation the dispute is accommoda
ted to mutual Perhaps no
reasonable objeÂ£iion can be offered tc
tais mode of proceeding, so proper tc
vindicate the violate 4 rights and
honor of an independent nation, unless
it be a blind adherence to certain fafh
ionable and courtly maxims of the day,
by which it is endeavored to be incul
cated, " that peace, and a good under-
Handing with Great-Britain, inuft be
arcferved at any price; that by pursuing
his policy alone can the infant system
)f our government take root andftabili
:y ; and that America ought, imper
ceptibly, to grow to greatness, like the
rees of herwilderneifes, in the midst of
lilence and retreat."âMaxims, repug
nant to the essential interests and pros
perity of our country, which do not ap
ply to her relative situation and cir
cumstances, and which, in the opinion
jf the great body of the yeomanry of
America, flow from the influence of
that partial system of things, wherein
the advantage of the marly is made sub
servient to the emolument and aggran
dizement of the few; a system already
x>o well understood, to admit the ag
gravation of that farther injury to the
-ights of the people, which, an adhe
rence to those maxims in thepreffcnt
nftance, might produce.

Extrafy from Umfrevjlle's " Prtfcnt
Jlatc of Hudsons-Bay."
(A late Work.)
THERE is not, perhaps, any joint
trade or monopoly existing, that
is carried on in a manner more unoftcn-
Latious, or what is meant by the vulgar
termfnug, than that which is in the
bands of the Hudson's Bay Compa
ny. The commodities in which they
rade, are procured in so sterile and
r i igid a climate, and by so few agents,
:hat there is no scope for that eager
competition for subordinate emoluments
which the more genial and exteniive
erritories of the East hold out to needy
idventurers.
Twenty years ago the governor of
York-Fort, which was the company's
principal establishment in the Bay, an
nually sent home at Icaft thirty thou
sand skins, and maintained no more
than twenty-five men, at very low wa
?es ; at present that place has upwards
of one hundred men at it, who have in
creased salaries, and it fends home no
more than twenty thousand skins, upon
an average, from itfelf and four subor
dinate settlements ; and these are pro
cured at an expence, which a few years
back would have been looked upon as
next to an annihilation of their com
mercial existence.
It is an incontrovertible faft,*that
since the Frcnch have evacuated Cana
da, the fur trade from the inland parts
of Hudson's Bay, has been carried on
to a greater extent than ever it was be
fore ; for the company, who till then
confined themselves to the sea-shore.
knew nothing of the numerous nation:
inland; and these again knew as little
of them : that the company, notwith
standing they had obliged themfelvc:
by their charter to explore the whol<
of their territories, confined themfelve:
within a small circle. They consequent
ly did not exert their influence to pro
cure peltries, or to augment the con
[dmption 6f British manufa&ures, by
iny other methods than through the
channel of a very few Indians, compa
ratively speaking. These Indians, how
iver, brought down enough to enrich
n few individuals, whose interest it was
to prevent too great an influx of furs,
which would not only lower the price
market, but probably open the eyes
as an injured commercial people. In
:be days I am alluding to, the port ol
V >rk-Fort was surrounded with nations
as Irldians entirely unknown to the tra
ilers of the company ; and they woulc
sEve remained in the fame state of ig
norance to this day, had they not beer
t .vakened from their reveries by the un
urmountable perseverance of a few Ca
ladian merchants, who found their
xit, through obstacles and impediment!
it tended with more danger and perfon
(l hazard than a voyage to Japan.
Since that time their affairs have un
dergone a material change in these parts,
The Canada merchants annually fend
nto the interior country, for the Indian
rade, about forty large canoes of about
our tons burthen each, a confiderabk
jart of which goods are conveyed tc
hose Indians who used to fend theii
urs down to the Hudson's Bay, by the
ndian carriers, which did not amounl
o half the quantity at present procured.
>o that by this interference of the Ca
ladian traders, it is evident that many
nore peltries are procured and import -
:d into England, and a greater quanti
y of its manufa&ures consumed than
leretofore. And when it is further
tonfidered, that these goods are of a
/cry inferior quality, which perhaps
.ould hardly find a sale elsewhere, thn
ixtenfion of the trade will appear an
>bje& not very inconftderable.
By the prosecution of this commerct
roin Canada, the Hudson's Bay com
'any found themselves eiftftually fup
)lanted on the sea-shore, the natives be
ngfupplied inland with every conve
liency for war and domeflic uses. Thi:
nduced the company, in the year 1773
o begin their inland voyages, so thai
he Canadians from Canada, and th(
Europeans from Hudson's Bay, met to
;ether, not at all to the ulterior advant
tge of the natives, wh6 by this mean:

I T may be agreeable to some of -ou:

A'ifhes, whims, and dreams, of the gen

will make a few extratts from intercept

o their good friends of the clergy, th<
lobility, and the old government. The)
ire as follow :
" The coalition of sovereigns armec

is definitively agreed upon.â
she means of executing their refolu

" Twenty thousand Pruflians are upor

" Orders are given to invade Franca

iftancecanbe made to such a union of
llrength, the army will be able to pene
rate into the heart of the kingdom
(vithout linking a (troke. The firft
tep will be to dil'arm all soldiers that
jretend to be citizens, and all citizens
hat pretend to be loldiers."
" it may be expetied that the united
forces will getpolfeflion of Paris about

je re-instated on his throne, with all

irince of Conde."
" The national aflembly (hall be dif

" To give liability to this renovated

idvantages of this form of government,

o destroy all the republics exiftingâlt
nightbepropofed, however, condition
illy, to retain the republics of Swit

t would fecm belt to erect it into a
kingdom for the husband of the prin

he Austrian Netherlands Holland
would make a pretty kingdom enough,
irabant. with a few of the neighbor
ing margraviates, might be given to the
ting of Prussia, in exchange for Silesia.
This would make a kingdom for the
luke of Yftrk, the king of Prussia's fon
n-law.
The Milanese, the States of Genoa,
ind the small republics of Italy, might
ie thrown into one kingdom, under the
name of the kingdom of Liguria. The
(land of Corsica should be re-annexed
:o the kingdom of Sardinia. The French
part of St. Domingo to be restored to
Spain by the assistance of fleets and the
white colonistsâThese fame fleets might
ifterwards go and take pollcflion of the
LJnited States of America, which, when
formed into a kingdom, would be very
acceptable to one of the sons of the king
as Great-Britain."â
The means of executing all these pro
jects would no doubt correspond with
the convenience of the arrangements.

LONDON, Sept. e6.
WE cannot agree with Mr. Paine
in considering this country as destitute
of a constitution. A constitution we
cettainly have, and excellent in theory,
but what do we behold in its prattice ?
Corruption and undue influence ap
pearing in a thousand horrid forms
Political honesty made a jest of by men
in office ; two thirds of the people ex
cluded from any (hare in the choice oftpVcfeiUativcs ; and general election,
i nftead of being an *xertion of the na
t ional virtue,, a fignai. for the introduc
tion of bribery, perjury, drunkennels,
riot, and every vice that can taint the
morals of the people. The long dura
tion of parliaments is matter, too, of se
rious complaint; but.unlcfs the manner
of eiefting be amended, the frequency
of ele&ions would only be to curse the
nation with a more frequent repetition
of the mod horrid and flagitious prac
tices. These things, and many more
that might be mentioned, must undergc
a reformation, if we would avoid the
very lowest depth of public degeneracy,
and its unavoidable consequenceS, im
pending ruin and deftrufclion;
It requires no uncommon degree o(
forefight tp perceivc that the revolution
now accomplished in France will force
us into a leform, from motives of the
rnoft cogent and convincing kind, anei
which will come home to the feelings
of every individual, namely, thole o!
interestâthe interest, not of a few, but
of all. The I'"ranch have the honed)
and courage to call into actual exercise
those excellent principles, which oui
conflitution docs, indeed, present to u:
in theory, but of which our domeftie
politics, as long as it continues, will
prevent the praflice. They have ex
tended the right of election to its ut
most poflible limitsâtheir representa
tives are to fit no longer than two year:
âthey have endeavored to check am
bition in its career, and to cut up ever)
species of undue influence by the root!
have cancelled all inviduoui
diftintlions on account of religion ; anc
there scarcely can exist a doubt thai
they will, in a very short time, annihi
late that enormous load of debt ir
which the pride and extravagance o
former kings and minifteis had invol
ved them.
Let us carrv our view forward tc
what will probably be the comparativ<
situation of France and England in the
course of a few years. â The formej
eased of her taxes, enabling her mer
chants and manufacturers to carry th<
produce of their industry and ingenui
ty to every foreign market on thi
cheaneft terms âholding sacred th<
rights of conscience as well as property
â .1.: nitting to the privileges ot citizen
all men of ail nations and religionsâ
opening her fofteiing bosom as a nur
fery for genius, and a refuge from even
species ot oppreflidn. In a word, hold
ing ou every poflible inducement tc
the p<- pie of other countries to com:
and participate in the bjeffings of peace
and plenty âl.berty and virtue.
Shall we contrail the atlual fituatioi
of England with that of FranceâW<
cannot âthe pift' ie is 'oo gloomy t<
be realizedâwe too must have a revo
lution, not in the principles but in the
practice of our conflitution. âAlthougl

EUROPEAN STATE OF POLITICS.
The emperor and the king of Prussia
ire said to have met about something,
3ut no one can clearly tell what ; they
â nay, or may not have conversed con
cerning France ; but whatever they
may intend, it is to be trusted that lit
tle mifchief to the cause of liberty, in
an age like the present, can enlue,
againfl the energy of an unanimous peo
ple, which as advocates for a difFerent
form of government from that which they
lately experienced, the French nation
certainly areâfor if ablolute monarchs
be permitted to suggest by what form 2
neighboring kingdom fha.ll be govern
sd, little in favor of the people can be
expected. Imperfect as the new con
(litution at present may be, the people
sf France have now fufficient materials
with which to workout their own hap
piness, without the interference of fur
routiding nations ; and we will hope
there is too much virtue in Europe, tc
luffer such an officious affiftauce.
The PAPAL STATES of ITALY
Have lately difcovcrd flrong symptom:
sf discontent; and the mifchicf of it is
bis holiness has no power to oppose
against any advances that may be made
upon his ancient prerogatives, but the
artillery of anathema, which of late
years has been discovered to be very
barmlefs in its effects.
POLAND
Has yet met with no interruption

put in motion, and found to work well
and harmoniously with the whole.â
Neighboring despotism a fie th to frown,
jut its frowns are despised ; though
much remains at some future time to be
done for the Poles. The people at large
are certainly much happier circum

ExtraÃ of a letter from Ncw-Jerfry, Dec. 5.
" Too much cannot be said in favour of that po
icy which is beginingto turn the attention of this
Tiate towards manufactures. We ihall not only,
jy an adherence to this principle, add to the
wealth of new Jcrfey, but shall work a reform in
he morals of a very great part of our citizens.
Poverty is generally attended with a propenfityto
vicious practices, but if we t2ke away the cause of

will of them fclves soon cease. A life of industry
s generally a life of virtue, but so great a propor

hat even induilry is but partially rewarded; and
t is well know n the greater of the nett pro
luce of our labour has ever centered in New York
ind Pennsylvania, as having no foreign trade of

By the jurifdittion of the Scots clergy over the

-brought under the power of the worst. By per
.petuating the errors of a barbarous system, l
men of education and good fcnle are
with the jt\igton of their country. It will al
ways be as difficult for the human mind to sep
arate true religion from theunfeemly garb the i!
made to wear, as to diftinguiih a venerable char
after under a ludicrous drefc. In Scotland,
t.iere.ore, men of education and good ferife be

which enthuiiafm has rendered ridiculous ; and
to defpiic thole doctrines, the ablurdity of which
has {hocked their understandings. To luppofe
that a man of enquiry in Scotland pays any re
gairl to revelation, will hardly be deemed a
Compliment. Jo presume that he believes the
orthodox opinions of the ft litter clergy will It

launch into the dark and joylcfs depths of athc

wild and uncertain to prove an adequate luppori
ot virtue. But the generality of the men oi

retrained licence ot behaviour : they ridicule the
lyftems of their country, without fubflituting ir

life. In a word, the etlabhfhed faith of the
Scots church is as finccrcly delpifed among tht
higher ranks, as among the interior orders it i:
implicitly received. The coi^lequencesof those

flies from religion with disgust ; the other del"

Musing behind the counterâ-all his aim
To catch the pence of lady or of squire.
Mod things I bought, but alwaysfigh'd for more
I bought, indeedâbut not one ounce of wit :
IVlark that, and mark it down to my confufion-
O credit, credit, what a cheat art thou ! â 
J paid no calhâââ'twas noted for a crime
By that recording hand, which waste-boo,
keeps.
Nor that alone; but cruelly transfers
To Journal, Ledgerâand the Lord knows what.
Away I went ; my buyings fafely ftow'd,
"Whether on negro's head, or drayâno matterâ
Soft pafs'd the joyous months that interven'd,
While yet the busy hours ran sweetly on,
While yet no 'prentice boys approach'd my door
With lectures short, but serious as the grave,
Preaching up mournful truths from beardless chir
But pay-day came at 1 artâand with it bro'
.Unnumber'd plagues and cares, ana doubts, an
fear?,
And grunts, and growls, and grumblings withoi
end,
And quirks, and quibbles, lies and fubterfuges,
Eillets and nates with compliments cut snort ;
A) eâfuch as scarcely faidyour bumbleJervant!
Whene'e I valk'd thefheets, I found no reft-
And would have met (horn'd, tail'd, an
hoof'd,)
"Old Satan's leif, than fae'd one creditor'
The knocker had no interval of pause,
And e\ery man that came, came with a dun,
And" fancy looks, and ftilf impertinence,
And heavy lowering brow, that fpc-ke no good !
What could I muTe .â¢'âl bundled up my duds,
Pull'd-to the door, that stood upojl a jar,
Beneath the threihold laid the landlord's key,
And at the hour when ghosts are said to walk
Mfcrth'd -fF, and left even Mofler Snip unpaid !
Blame me, ye men of cold philosophy,
That fear not flieriffs, con.'Ubles, or writs i â 
Â£l>me me who willâl relish not a jail,
And, be my trotters in what plight they may,
(Even tbo' my galiey -gcjkins were unfoal'd)
Still ft i.ld they bear me from rhole dull retreats
Whers want of spirit keeps the prisoner fact,
And wretches pine, and harpies turn theJtey.
