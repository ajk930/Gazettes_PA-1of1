A Political enquiry into the heft means cj
improving the Commerce cj the
American States.
[Continuedfrom our lajl.}
THERE are two claffcs of people in
this country, who, I forelee, will
have very little rclifh for the opinions
1 havQ been endeavoring to establish.
in the preceding pait of my addrcis,
Theieare, Jirji, prejudiced people, whe
â¢will never quit the;,eld track, be it evei
so inconvenient; and,Jecondly. intere'hed
persons, who will naturally raise ob
j eft ions to whatever seems to interfere
with their favorite schemes.
The southern slates (fay foftie) are toe
warm; and those to the north and
north-eafl, too cold, for the breeding
a tuHiCiency of sheep to supply a large
woolen rnanufaftory in America.
In answer to this objection, 1 observe,
that the southern provinces of Spain
are exposed to a ft:ll greater cxcefs of
heat than those of the United States of
America, and yet support iminenlc ma
nufactures of woolen, for the purposes
of commerce. The northern parts of
Germany are extremely cold in whiter,
and yet they likewiie exccl in the ma
nufacture and exportation of woolens.
Thefc are truths so well known in the
commerc'ai world, that I fuppole nobo
dy will dii'putc them.
It would be worth while to remark,
in refpeft to the qualities of wool, thai
in the north as well as the south of Eu
rope, there are a particular breed o!
sheep, whose wool is finer, longer, anc
bearing a greater refeinblance to silk
than that of any other fort. It is ob
ferv-cd, too,that difference of chntote an*
the many varieties of paflurage are pro
duftive of three lorts of wool, the bell
the indifferent, and the worst. Thcf(
three varieties may be considered a:
the principal fupportof the cloth mar.u
factories, and are, we may fay, the gold
en fleece for any nation, that knows how
to"turn to the bed advantage the re/our
ces which a well directed induftry'put
into their hands.
Wool is the better in quality for thi
fleece not being fho-rri too early in tin
season. The ancient laws of the king
dom of France fixed the time of fhee;;
{hearing to the tenth of June. It is re
markahle that the fleeces shorn aboi;
this time yield at leaf!; about one-fourtl
more from the loom, than those take;
later, and better prefcrvc that natura
hlky gloss, which is very imperfeftl)
imitated by the use of gums. Ano
iher advantage in shearing sheep abou
this time, arises, from the fleece be
ing then arrived to aftateol maturity
\vhich makes the cloth more fufceptibi;
of the ayes and fliffening.
It has cost every manufacturing na
tion in Europe abundance of trouble tc
hriog their woolen fabrics to the neces
sary degree of perfection. Even Swe
den, notwithHanding the rigour of hei
climate in winter, has succeeded no)
only in her endeavors to propagate the
breed of Englilh sheep, but alio in im
proving the aborigr.al flock, by intro
ducing rams from abroad. If there be
only moderate care taken to protest
these animals from the severity of ilorms,
and keep them under flicker during
winter (as is the calc in Sweden) in or
der to prevent the rain from breeding a
rot in the wcol, there is no danger but
â¢that it will always be excellent in its
quality.
It may be objected that a flrift nation
al attention to the propagation of sheep
would divert too many people from the
duties of agriculture, insomuch as even
to injure, ultimately, the progrels of
the woolen manufacture itfelf. I an

wool, he fides manure proper for fertil
izing the ground. This quantity of
wcol wrought into fine broadcloths,
would, with proper management fur
nifh a circulation of more than Â£.'~cco
in trade, and give fubfifttence to a mul
titude of people in the towns, who
might at all times he kept buly, while
tho/e in the country might be profitably
employed in the winter, when agricul
tural labors arc fulpended.
If iueh methods were adopted, there
would be no danger of the lands iuÃer
ing for want of cultivators ; so far frui:
it, that these are the very means to in
crcaie the number of husbandmen, a-nr
confcquently the quantity of land ii
tillage. It might be oblerved
that mountains and heights inaccefub!;
to the plough, are the rnoflt proper foi
the support of sheep. Certain it is, tha
these animals arc. much .fonder of the
sallturage on eletfirtcd situations, thai:
he contrary ; since here they breathe ;
tlear wholfome air, which contribute:
lot a little to their growth and the fine
less of their wool. The Pyrennear
nountams, the Alps, and the mole rug
;ed parts of Switzerland, are every
where covered with ilocks of sheep.
vhofe flceccs 1 apply the manufactories
ind enrich a country naturally churhih
ind barren. It is clear, then, from
hsle mftanccs, that the raifmg of sheep
tan neither injure the public, nor be
jrejudicial to agriculture. On thecon
raiy, a woolen manufacture, well efta
jhlhed, would bean inexhauftiblefourcc
)f wealth, a fund constantly increasing,
md flowing from the hand of industry
0 circulate through the country at
arge, and serving as the ground-work
or the efitabiiflunent of an extensive
tommfrce.
Per lons inclined to raise difficulties,
md thro w obfltacles in the way of this
;lan, may poffibiy objcCt, that the po
pulation of America is too mconfidera
t>le for pro, cits of this kind at pre fen t :
hat our flax, our silk, our wool arc toe
trifling m quantity to build such
ichcines upqn, &c. A thousand instan
ces, however, prove the contrary to
-hefe alfcrtiojis. Geneva and Liecc
were much more scant of people, in
proportion to their extent, than the
United states, when industry and the.
patronage of government caused the:i
infant manufactures to begin to prosper.
A imall town, or village, that lets idell
in earnelt about any manufacture, i:
equally capable with the urged of ad
vancing i. to the utmost poiLble degree
of perfection. Whoever has travelled
through Europe, will fublcribe to the
truth of my observation, where an in
finite number of very conliderable efta
blifhme;.:s in i;,anuiaCtures are carried
t>n in villages.
In regard to the growing of flax, al
though there are vail quantities of this
article railed, it is certain, t/iat a great
er demand from the manufactories wouie
at once a e.eale the quantity, a-, \vu:
the cafe a lew years ago in Pi u ilia. Te
[peak cai.d.dly, the culture of flax doc:
not appear to be properly attended to in
ill parts of the United States. The lane
tor this purpose ought to be of the vei)
Deft kinel ; the clod should be brokci
fine, ar.d the ground as well preparer
with dung. &c. as you would a spot so:
1 garden. The flax-feed may then b<
own as thick as you wfould foÂ»v grass
eed in a meadow ; but when it is auou'
ix inches high, it should be carefully
weeded, without which, grals and othei
/egetable substances would be apt tc
mpede the. growth. In the Aufttriar
Low Countries, they often lecure then
lax by {ticking it ; that is to fay. the
>ranehes or fuckers are tied to little
lakes, about a foot high, to keep i
rom falling down, or lodging, and con
equently losing much of its good quali
y. Inthismanner, too, they lecure then
lax in Flanders and Zealand, when
.t grows to the greatest perfection, anc
f.-rnilfccs for lace, cambric
and othsr.finc textureÂ®, trom its bcirit
irery long and of * fine fibre. There i;
llfo another fort, perhaps, little knowr
n America, railed the Averlajiing Sibcri
in flax: 'l'r.is species of flax (like thi
ugar cane) grows ieverai years frorc
he fame root, always springing up a
lew, as soon as the old stalk is cutoff
Naturalists have observed that there are
n common, from thirty to forty (talks
n this kind of flax, growing out fron
he fame root. Experience has proved
hat the general qualities of this plant
or manufadlure, are fully equal to thoi"
jF the belt flax of o:hcr kinds more gene
rally known in Europe. The only de
etl is, that its fibres cannot be fpui
nto the finefl fort of threadâbut then
n e abundance of uses for which acoarl
:r {(Cxture is equally valuable with tin
t,'i?r ; mankind ftaoding in need no
>niy of fuperfine linens, but, much
nore generally, of thole that are coari,
.rid flout.
Ihe cultivation of Siberian flax
hould be a national object, then, 11
America ; for this plain reason, tha
he annual expence, in the commor
.vay, of preparing and lowing thf
jround would be saved, except at lone
r.tcrvals of time ; it being onlv neceffa
y to sow it once, and it will yield the
noft abundant crops for a great numbci
)f years.
Rawfilk may be justly reckoned one
if the principal materials for a national
nanufacture. With regard to this com
modity, however, there are people
tmongll us not ashamed to alfert, that it
.annot be produced, in any considera
te quantities, in cold countries. The
"xampie of Pruflia, where mduftry is
day making unrivalled progress,
is amply fufficient todeftroy a prejudice,
which nas indeed antiquity on its fide,
but has been ruinous to this branch of
irt. Ever since the king encouraged
the planting of mulberry-trees, Pruiiia
has railed lilk enough to lupply her
whole national manufactures in that ar
iicle. liut it mull be remarked here,
.hat it was not merely the good wishes
xf the court that established this noble
manufacture in Pruflia ; it was in its
nfancv alfiduoully encouraged, and di
rected by laws and regulations favora
ble to those employed in the nurture of
ilk-worms, as well as to the
urers of the fjl-k. In tracing the pro
:edureofthe Pruflian govenimont, re
ative to the silk manufactory, wefnall
uniformly find that the Prulfian mo
narch was deeply impreiTcd with the
importance and utility of such eflablilh
ments, to the welfare of his nation. In
:he next place, to prevent the exporta-
Dt raw silk from his dominions, he if
iued a mandate in 1749, in which his
Ã¼bjects were forbidden, under pain of
i'evere penalties, to lell an\> of their raw
ilk to foreigners, or to export any the
.call quantity out of the kingdom, upon
my pretence whatever ; but to carry it
to the national manufactories, where
they would find a ready market for it,
there to be wrought up into the various
fluffs for home use, as well as exporta
tion. The leverity of this law was ex
tended even to velvets made abroad, thf
wearingof which was prohibited by an
edict which decreed, that all foreign vel
vets found in the kingdom that fhoulc
Jie proved to be of foreign manufacture
should be torn to pieces and burnt b)
the hands of the common executioner
by 'he fame edict, the Pruflian taylor:
were forbidden to make up any suit o:
imported velvet. This was done
pointedly, with a view to exclude tin
productions of the neighboring silk ma
nufactories of other nations ; anditwa
no uncommon thing for the monarcl
himfelf to refufe an audience to an'
person, be his quality what it might
who was clothed in a suit of any foreigi
manufacture whatever.
But it is not Pru-tfia alone, among the
northern powers of Europe, that has
found the good effects of a cariful at
tention to the culture of the white mul
berry-tree ; very lately all the other ci
vilized dates, itill further north, have
ftrenuouflv endeavored to free them
felvesfrom a dependence upon the more
louthern nations, for the article of fiik.
The fevcral circles of the German em
pire, as well as Denmark, have at pre
lent an abundance of the fpeciesof mul
berry trees above mentioned, which
they cultivate to the greatest degree of
perfection,
Thcfe examples must convince every
body of the fallacioufnefs of the idea,
tiiat the eftablifhinent of fiik. manufac
tories is only practicable in warm coun
tries. In F ranee there is not, at this
day, a single province which has not a
considerable number of thelemoft valu
able trees v and not a few of the principal
oads through the kingdom are planted
with them for many hundreds of miles
n length, on each fide, lie fides all
his, the government has taken care
mulberry nurseries should be continu
ally in growth, to supply, gratis, every
person that {liould think proper to plant
;hem on his lands.

according to the proportion aforefaic
of one representative for every thirty
thoufandinhabitants; whichbeing read
was agreed to, and ordered to be en
grafted, and read the third timeto-mor
row.
According to the order of the day, th<
house resolved itfclf into a committee o
the whole on the report of the commit
-tee of ele&ions, relative to Mr. Pink
oey's resignation, and Mr; Mercer's cer
tificate of eletlion in his room, from th<
executive of the state of Maryland.
A great deal of debate took place, re
lative, f-rjt, to any legal obligation Mr
Pinkney might be supposed to lie unde
to the acceptance of his appointment t(
a feat in the house of representatives
and, â¢secondly, in relpeft to the conftitu
tionality of Mr. Mercer's election.
In the opinion of several speakers
Mr. Pinkney was -not bound by th<
words of the constitution to accept hi.
appointment; that any obligation or
that score could only be remotely dedu
ced by implication, and that unless th(
right of resignation had been denied ex
prefsly in the constitution, Mr. Pink
ney was independent of any compulfior
of this kind. He had infringed upor
no contrati ; and tho' it was in'thi
power of the house to inflict a penalty
on such occasions, no rule for that pur
pose had as yet been eftablifhcd; anc
therefore Mr. Pinkney had been lef
perfectly at his liberty in this matter
co att as he pleafert. Mr. f iirkney'
cafe appeared to them to be plain an<
simple ; they could fee no inconvenien
cies likely to arise from accepting hi
resignation, and hoped the report of th<
committee would be adopted.
After some time spent in further de
bating on this fubjeft, the chairman o
the committee reported jin amendment
which report and amendment wen
twice read, and agreed to by the houle
and are as follow :
" It appears that at an election heli
for the state of Maryland on the iirl
day of O&ober, 1790, William Pink
ney was duly elected a reprefentativ
for that state, to serve in the lioufe- o
Representatives of the United States.
" That the certificate of his electioi
lias been duly transmitted by the execu
tive thereof, and heretofore so reportec
by your committee.
" That, by letter dated the twenty
sixth of September, 1791, directed to th<
governor and council of that state
William Pinkney refigiied that ap
pointtnent; and that, in confequenci
of such resignation, the executive ilfue<
a writ for an election, to supply the va
cancv thereby occasioned, and have cer
tified that John Francis Mercer was du
ly electpd, by virtue of that writ, ir
pursuance of the law of the state of Ma
ryland in that cafe provided,
" Resolved, That it is the opinion of
his committee, that John Francis Mer
:er is entitled to take a feat in this
louse, as one of the representatives for
he state of Maryland, in the room of
William Pinkney."

tion, complaining of the undue election
md return of Anthony Wayne, from
Georgia. Mr. Muhlenberg in the
Chair.
Before any of the resolutions was ta
ken into con fide ration,
Mr. Wayne rose, and observed, thai
about eleven months were now elapsed,
lince the election, which is at pre fen 1
called in question, had taken place
that the House was already upwards ol
four weeks in feilion ; âthat the peti
:ioner must surely have had time fuffici
?nt to come forward, at the firft meeting
as the Houle, to support the charge's
contained in his petition ; âthat it could
hardly be imagined, the want of time
prevented him from advancing âno !
it was rather to be fuppoled, that he was
kept back by the want of evidence, tc
substantiate those charges; andperhap;

jority in the lcgillature of Georgia, to
countenance his claims :âthefe were

n which they h been obtained,. tiiat.
ne fair!. was a subject of investigation foi
i future day :âfome of them were un
ier the signatures of perfens, -who hat
never read-, nor were capabi; of reading
;hem he felt for the situation of fomi
as those individuals, as they were al
ready presented for perjury on that oc
:afion.
He declared that he entertained no
:hc most dillant delire to procraftinati
in enquiry into the merits of the elec

not but be obvious to every gentlemai
on the floor, that no other country ii
the world would countenance the modi
in which Mr. Jackson had proceeded
by the publication of ex-part: evidence
on a lubje6t, that was to come under th<
of the House.
He concluded by declaring his unwil
lingnefs to treipafs on the time of thi
committeehe would therefcrecnly be;
leave to recapitulate, that eleven month
were elapied, lince the election tool
place ; and that the petitioner had, eve
iince, been induftrioufiy employed ii
procuring evidence :âif the committer
Should be disposed to indulge the gen
tleman with further time for that pur
pole, he would not, for his part, maki
the Imalleft objection to granting hin
that indulgence : should they think pro
per to adopt the report now under con
lideration, which seemed to contem
plate and even to invite the advances o
that gentleman, he would have no ob
jeftion to meet liini upon that ground
or upon any other, provided it were ho
norable ground.
ihe Speaker then resumed the chair
and Mr. Muhlenberg reported, that th
committee had taken the report into con

PARIS, Sept. 9.
Lass night count L:chtenftein arrived here
t;om Vienna, charged with dispatches from the
emperor, and, as it is believed, with the impor
tant relult of the interviews which have been
held there 011 the fubjecl. of France. While the
puolic are daily agitated with alarming notices of
armies marching, magazines forming, and trea
ties made 10 counteract the revolution, the intel
ligent politician oblerves, that a more prudent
policy governs the councils of Germany, and that,
profiting by the lelfon of France, the emperor
and the king of Pruffis have determined to take
the only means of avoiding the ,mtrodu6lion of
the French disease, namely, that of reducing
tiieir enormous armies, and by a thorough eco
nomy in all tiie departments of ityeir expcuce,
to eale the burthens of the people, and turn them
to objects of indultry and manufacture. It is
la:d, that the reduction of their armies is to be
cained to 100,000 men each, and 10 much the
yoKe under which the empite groans is to be
lightened. Ali this is to be set down to the
credit of the French revolution.

Address, vot yetJirnrd., from the Bijl.ofsand Clergy
cj the Chunk of England to the Rev. Dr.
Pnetlley.
WHEN outrages againfl the public peace have
been committed, which bear the QrongeÃ pre
emptive marks of having been fomented by a
particular body of men, it becomes all of that bo
dy who polfefs the sentiments of moderation and
ulltce to enter their protefl against such outra
ges, and to disclaim the authors and abettors of
hem We, therefore, the minillers of ihe Gos
pel of peace, think it our duty to express our
regret caufeof thechurch
if England has been made the pretext for di!â
uibing the peace of lociety, violating the pro
perty, and endangering the lives of individuals
ind disgracing our country in the eyes of all Eu
lope. We have to lament, that there still ex ; lts
o much of the Ipirit of bigotry, and that our pt
3us labours have failed of enlightning the peo
ple in so material a point. Wuhjegard to your
elf, Sir, we cannot be insensible to the enmuy
i'ou bear againll our hierarchy, ar.d we shall be
4 10 you silenced by your answerers, but
A 'C would not have you burnt by the n;ob. We
)we >Â°u no aÂ£feÂ£tion, but we conceive we have
10 "ght to do you injury. We enjoy too much
mnelves from the favour and proteflion of the
aw, to wish to throw down its fences ; and we
l j e 'enfible that when our own houses are of
, als it would be bad policy in us to begin
peaking of windows. We beg you to believe
hat, as most of us have fludied at the Univetfity,
tve are able to unclei Hand a F. guie of fpeecb, andcari diÂ£linguifh bef.wcn real and metaphorical
gunpowder ; that we do not t'niiik hard words
piopeily anlwcedi bv throwing Pones, or argu
ments conluted-by pulimJ down !Â«xiles. We
uie of opinion, t hat a p.-n is a lawful, and a blud
â¢ eon an unlawful weapon; and that as pamphlets
however severe, break no bones, they arc unfairly
retaliated by a (bower of brickbats. We cannot
help fufpecling there is an abfnrdity in a man','
fheving his zeal for the Constitution, by break
ing the King's peace, nor can we think that any
projefi of mending the laws is quite lo dangeroui
as the open violation ot them. Moreover we
tonfider ourselves as connected with you by the
collateral studies of our profellion, and thouj-J
\ve cannot join wilh you as a theoiogian, we rtf
peÂ£t you as a philo'opher. We fmcerely la
ment the lofsthe learned world has Curtained b\
the deurutlion of your labours,and the inlliu
mcnts of your future labours, and we feel Ihatm
and indignation at the thought, that while othe
nations are improving in science and liberality
this country will be bianded wilh the reproac:
of fanaticifm worthy only of barbarous ages anc
nations. As churchmen we cannot but diflikt
you, but as men, we sympathize with yo.iâa
scholars, we venerate you âas chriflians, we ad
mite the rneeknefs with which you have exprel
fed yourfelf on so trying an occasionâand a.
F.nglilhmen we regret, that after having doni
honour to you, we fhmild be called upon to tor
give yourcountry. We aie sensible that no
thing can bring lo great an odium upon your op
ponents as the late proceedings ; and we do no
love you well enough to wilh you the crown o
martyrdom. With regard to our own interefls
we car.desire nothing better than to keep thing
quiet, and are sensible, that the agnation of th
public mind, would '.n the end be less fonriida

ExtraÃ of a letter from Princeton, Ncv. 25.
It was formerly oblerved, 111 drawing the com
parilon between the Enghfhand French nations
with refpeft to literary proilufctions, that
" The weighty bullion of one British line,
Diawn to French wire, would through who!
pages Ihtne."
At prelent, however, the literary character 0
these two nations, seems to have undergone a tola
change: The Englilhman is light, flowery, ani
declamatory ; the Frenchman is lound, laboriou
and convincing. What may be the caufeof th
declenfiori of able writers in England, I will no
pretend to fay; but in France, it is evident to me
1 hat the gradual advances towards liberty, and th'
change of government from defpotilm to a mo
naichy extremely limited, has done every thing
Formerly, it was dangerous for a Frenchman u
employ his pen upon the great political topick
which have since been Itarted ; the confequenc
was, that he degenerated into a mere writer o
anecdotes, v-rfes to the ladies, and other fnvu
lons productions of the kind. âI should be forr
10 suppose, that the decay of good writing i
England, is a fore-runner of the decay of liberty
although it must be confefi'cd, that, like th
clouds of Magellan in the South seas, one is rare
ly fcen above the political horizon unattended b
1 he other.

1 here are, however, and mull be fame excepti

that class of strangers who aie busied in inttituting
what they are pleased to call patriotic societies,

II If we confidcr England and her citizensin
i colledlive view, we (hall find, that it is to thei,
public (pint alone the nation is indebted for all
the (upeiior advantages it enjoj;. We (hali ;,if<
perceive that these advantages, for the n.oft p.,ri,
ariiefiom caulesexternal and artificial. Wh?t an
â¢xample, then, is Grcat-ijriuin for France ! A

ind in a litoation to ensure her own tranquility,
vitiiout a dependance upon her neighbour.
M concluding the peace in 1763, England ow
d .event; millions sterling more than when the
var in 1756. This-peace was, apparently
nemo 3 glorious for England that ever Ihe fuel
nade, because (he diflated the terms, and forced

eta!ncd her poireffions in India, infilled upvn the
cl'ion of Canada, and a pleaded several IGands in

iflrous to France, was as glorious to Englandâ
>ut notwithfranding all this glory, and the eclat
_>f conquest, the consequence of their very fuccef
wouH have been fatal to England, had it nor
:een for the public spirit of the nation, which sur
mounted all dtffjcuities.
Rechoning, then, that the war preceding this
afrmentioned peace c-oft the nation seventy mil

half millions t ; -nr.ja! of England, in
order to'keep down the i .Here it of the war debt.
1 he foreign pollciiioiis they in ihe war,
paid a very tri/img part or ihele raxes, arid ever
what they did p*y, was tnrougti trie in duett me
dium of commerce. As to Ireland, it never con
tributed any thing, and it was impolfiale to gel
any thing worth mentioning from Scotland. '1 lie
taxes, however, must be paid.â it wj- then thai

abundant Source ot wealth, that is to favj their ma
nufacture: . 1 hele have enabled them to ex ten c
their trade, and the extcn/ion of their trade iinc<
the year has enabled them to bear up againil
every calamity and conquer every difficultyâ
Since that period the national debt has increafcc
one hundred and eighteen millions, iierling, anc
yet they ft.il find means to lay such impolitic
on See. as wiiJ pay the interest.
Ilx. In tne lucceedmg twenty-eight vears, Bri
tain was railed to a pitch of greatneis, whici
would be wholly incredible to those who had no
been eye-witnesses of the faS. it is true, the vef
fel of liate fuuered many feveie bulTettings durini
that long interval, but the public i'pirit of the na
tion always brought her faie into port, notwich

as in the American war.âln the fa"r a l 1783 i
required every exertion of the people to preven
the total difi'olution of the empire ; but it is re
markable, that public diiirefs in England has a
ail times Kept an even pace with individual prof
perity : while the people were enriching them
(elves, the molt exorbitant ambition and childill
projects of .the mini'iry swallowed up all the re
source* which national industry had called inti

But (till the public spirit of the nation was ne
ver abated by public misfortune. While the mi

j bie caule, enabled the miniitry to keep up the po
pekr ae|tÂ»(ion, and drain from the nation l'ubli
dies fu.Ticient for the carrying on a seven \ear
war.
IV. The repeated ill success of the Britilh arm
in the American war, only served ta add energy ti
the national fpiiit. From jear to year they an
ncipated better luck, while the Americans wer
impctcepnbly Healing their necks from under th
Criti/h joke; and aithough every year added a fe

prepofl'elled with an idea, that the American
would again become one people with them. No
even the revolt of the German Haves, that wer
sent to extintjuiih the liberties of America, fight

this falfe opinion. This event, as well as man

V . \Â» ..at could' Mr. Faint have meant by en
deavouring to persuade us that we have no con
cern or connexion with monarchy ?âAs long ,;s
our departments are united by a common tie and
j common i,ire reft; as long as their attention is
reitriftcd to objetls of adminiifration only, lo
will the Constitution, which we now, with"
out blafpheniy, cull tile real monarch, be the cen
tral point o/ our ftrengrh ; and if in addition to
this, tiie executive power be faithfully administer
ed, the ofiicers ot which are tefponlible for their
conduct, the constitution mud: continue forever in
all its original purity.
VI. By declaring the monarchy hereditaiy, we
have fecuied the empire from the intrigues and
plots of deligning men, who, if they could, would
fell Franco to foreign powers that hate us, fear us,
and are jealous Â«l our natural advantagesâTnia

Mas file not been the sport of neighbours, who
have divided her best territories among thrru
With such an example before our eves, and ac the
moment when Poland is reiloring an herediiar*
monarchy, how is it poflible that any true Iriend
to this country, would administer the potion of
deatn, in holding up to us elediive monarc.iy or
republicanil'm > In cafe of adopting the latter,
there would be, in reality,, eighty three republics
in trance } the hopeful fruits of their infernal po
licy,
Suppoling America surrounded by ambitious
neighbours j and luppofing Rhoae-lfland, who lo
obllinateJy refufed her acceflion to the unionâ
to have elkiteu a separation inttead of being re
united to the other ltates : By this time we fiiould
have lee a the dillintt iovereignties of Kentuckey,
Vermont, and Rhode-llland, in the feverai bo
soms ot which would have appeared a set of tur
bulent demagogues, or a tyrannical aristocracy,
which would have already begun the difi'olution of
the American empire.âAnd indeed to fpealc
plainly, we can fee nothing that will support their
present government upon a solid foundation, ex
cept the manners and habits ot the people j and
this only upon a supposition cf uninterrupted pa
cidcation.
VII. The political morals of Louis XVI.
have been wholly founded upon u-hat his cour-'
tiers called the Old Tefiainent of France, meaning
the antient despotic government. it will be hap-
Py nim, ir he wilj adopc the AVw Ttflumci.c,
given hiui oy the people, as the only rule 01 work
ing out his political lalvation, and will conudijr
it as his best title to royalty, and not heiitate 10
|'ut lis name to it, without further delay. His
individual happiness is linked with that or" France;
and he will find his new authority worth far more
than that which he has letâit will not, indeea,
be an omnipotence, which, as having no rational
limits, may be called in queition at every step he
takes. Louis the fifteenth, the constitutional
Louis, will now be every thing that he to
<e, since it is certain, that without tne law his
Superior, he is nothing.
