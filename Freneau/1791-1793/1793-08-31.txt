WE have read i'l the Sti>\ and in tht
chn-lejlon Daily Advert if sr. ot-thc
i:ki lime, 1793, an account, lhair.efully
!;Jfc-ue, of the proceedings .it Port-311
We are ton murti occupied with
otner b'. ,r nef.' to writ* a full detail of these
proceedings; but here follows a datemsnt
of the principal fatts, which we deiy your
emigrants to deny.
ilt. The town of P<>rt-aii-Prince, and
the parish of La Croix tie Bouquets, until
then enemies, formed a coalition, and in
vited, in the public papers tlle '4 pariflies
of the Wt ltern"Province so fend, each ol
them, two deputies to a federal aflembly,
for the purpose of deliberating ' upon tilt
new order of things which the events r!
the 10th of August had occasioned.-' U;-oh
or AjainJt is the f inie thing : for whpev-e:
l.as the right of deliberating upon, has o!
conference the right ol deliberating a
2d. A proclamation of Polvsre', one < 1
us, made this projrrt prove abortive,âtht
federal afiemb'y did not take place.
3d. Two or three d'ays after the slave:
of La Croix de Bouqif- ts were put into r
{late of revolt, and the m dl'acre and con
flagration were commences! by thatcla!
of citizens who were sworn to niaimai.
the decree of the 4t.11 of April, 1 793-
4th. The reduction of Poft-au-Prince.
the confi leinent of Hanus de Jumecourt,
and the flight of Borel, chief of the re
volters of Port-au-Prince, were fufficiem
causes for us to force all tlv insurgent flave
of La Croix de Bouquets to return to then
duty without any elFulion of blood.
sth. Borel and his accomplices ha*e
Â» quitted the colony, loaded with gold and
bills of exchange. Where have they taken
refuse? At Jamaica. You will observe,
that the declaration of war againll Eng
land was then known all over the colony
for more than three weeks.
6th. The letters of Borel, and the other
fugitives that accompanied him (which
have fallen into our hands) prove that the;
were sent to Jim u a for no other purpose
than to return to the colonies with all the
Britiih sea and land forcesâthey prove
that after having concerted their fscrc-i
plans at Jam area, they hoped to appear a
gain in force within lix weeks, upon oui
coalls ; but that the retufal of the paymenl
of the bills upon Lindo and other mer
chants of Jamaica, which they carri- d wit!
them, would disconcert their project anc
weaken their hopes of the fuccefa of the
invasion.
The disastrous events of the Cap?, art
no doubt dill much more mifreprcfented.
inasmuch as those who were ths greatell
culprits mall be now with you, and as the
more grievous and evident their crimes art
âthe greater mult be their elfurts to leac
aflrsy the public opinion.
We were occupied in restoring ordei
and public tranquility in the wed and ii:
tbÂ» fonth, when Galbaud arrived at the
Cape.
In our absence lie wanted precipitate!)
to take upon himfelf tin- onice of governor,
although the executive council velted i-r
us alone the power of making him knowi
ns such to the people. He caused his coin
million of governor to be publilhed an<
proftife!y circulated over all the colony
agreeably to the usage of ancient depots.
Louis tlieXlVth, or Soiiman, or Ferdi
jiand the Catholic.
In his firft proclamation, he fought on!)
to deflroy the credit of France, by an ex
pggerated picture of the facrifices vhicl
the republic had made in order to conver
her aflignats into dollars.
At the fame time he exerted all thi
force of his enmity against 11s, in Lis j)ri
vate conversations ; and whi 1d he did him
felf remain behind the ciirtain h# 111 de hi
brothei Cezar Galbaud (a>inan equally in
solent ard brutal, but nevertheless as great
V n coward as himfelf) the oftcnfible charac
ti riu forwarding his evil designs ; he pio
jiiifed the convoy tliat tliev fliorldfail with
out etir consent, and contrary to the order
prescribed by the executive council.
He aik-mbled ali the incorporated b-fdie;
cf the Cape, and. there summoned all the
American merchants ; he founded the a
larin at the town of the Cape ; lie greatly
alarmed even the intendant of the marine
himfelf.bv representing our urgent necellity
afld want of resources. It Was very so
lemn'y declared ia this avF-'mbly, that the
town of the Cape was in great wane ot all
kinds of provitluns, although the event has
proved that it was fujjplied with more than
fu&cicnt for one month., It was then well
known that the service could not be fup
porte I by any other means, than by draw
in* bills of exchange u;>on the treifury of
tin.* republic, which Galbaud began tosry
tl uv i ; he even went a* far as to declare,
th it, even w'itii the wtliflance ot bills on
France, the public service could ."lot, with
out a miracle, be long supported, although
we then had at our difpoial to the amount
of from thirty to forty millions o! livres
worth of colonial produce, belonging to
the republic, which was -iiiortiy to come
into our hands.
We at length arrived, and Galbaud, bv
the reception He received from the citi
z;ns, perceived that his influence and cre
dit was less than he expelled. The day
after our arrival, we h id an interview and
explanation with him in. the presence of the
inteudant of marine ; we told him, in the
firft place, that CezarGalbaud. his brother,
from his conduct and conversations, could
not remain in the colony. 2d. That he
was hunfelf, by law, excluded from t ie
government of St. Domingo, in confe
queuce of the decree oi the 4th of April,
which !;as deprived all ttvofefrom any hand
in the administration of the colony, who
held pofi'effions in it, ants that decree had
not yet been repealed. The day after lie
declared to ;i in ivritinp', that he wifliet!
us to apply to him that decree of exclufi
-011 ; and laid, he was too m ich an enthu
fl irt in the cause of liberty, and too much
of a republican not to obey our order and
requisition.
He had the fatisfaSion L-> demanded ,
for ue declared he could not be governor
of St. Domingo, and we accordingly
forthwith deprived him of that office to al.
intents and purposes, and Tent him 011
board of the armed transport yeflel cat
led La Normande.
It was in this stage of the business that,
in concert with admirals Cambis and Cer
.:y, he put the sailer; of the r<= petite io ?.
[fate of revolt; be was declared governor
-ommandaut ot the sea and land forces,
ind caused the vefi'els of the republic to b'e
drawn up agaiuft the town of the Cape.
He, with the arined crews of the veflels,
m ide a defevnt and took poflrffion ot the
arsenal ; he directed the who e of his ar
tillery and mufquetry against the house in
which we were lodged ; he set fire to the
town, and reduced three-fourths of it to
a.-hcS ; he set the example both of pillage
and of cowaidice.
On bis retreat he caused all the cannon
to be spiked. and threw into the sea all the
warlike ltorev ai d ammunition belonging
to the arsenal.
It was not till after this horrible expe
dition that he si t off, witn the ships Jupitei
andL'Eole, the frigates La Surveillante.Ls
Concorde, and La Piecieufe, the (loop o)
war the Favorite, and the Cert and Ls
Manche tenders, together with all the
merchant veflds that were then in the
road of the Cape. It appears ;hat La Con
corde has fmce lett them, but we know
not what became of her.
Galbaud has cost the town of the Cape,
or France, by this conflagration, ten hun
dred millions of livres ; and more than
[ixty millions to France, if the convoy and
its escort ihould fail into the hands of the
enemy. '
There remain with tis in the colony
airly the Americaof 74 guns, three frigates,
[>ne of which is out of service, their crew s,
me troops well habituated to the climate,
and 60,c00 revolted (lave*., devoted to the
Spaniards and the cause of kings; and ne
vertheless, \\e;ire far from despairing of
he public cause. We â - e nt/t fallen, and

" Though led to the Land of Promise,
by the hand of God, âthe If. aelites wither!
to return to the Fiefli Pots of Egypt, and
to their former Captivity."
rpHE Jew?, who had been accnflomed to
-* the bondage of the Egyptians, and their
manner of living, quitted Inch habits with
reluctance and regret; and it cannot be
denitfd, that we Americans, have but Wo
nearly so.lowed them in disposition. The
mo'.t iniplacahle war of devastation and
cruelty, .or seven years, did but suspend
the h'.biu and planners of the Englifit a
niong our citizens ; and though compelled
to a political reparation, pur taste and dif
potition remains unaltered, Tho' France
wooed us to her bofosi, we returned iin
mediately to the diflempered and rotten
breath of an unnatural mother, <vliÃfe
hatred and brutality could not wean usâ
whole corruption pleased our taste..ââ
While I lament this natural weakness in
the nation, which cannot be concealed, 1
inuft reprobate our legislators and govern
ors, whose duty it was to have corrected
its general influence. The moment we
no longer wanted the aid of France, our
'.'.oveniun, meanly, and of course ineffec
tually, paid their court to the government
of Great-Britain, intrigues in our enn
grefs, which would have chfgraced the
ilaves of despotism in Europe, marked
â¢heir daily proceedingsâevery state eon
tending who mould have til? honor of fend

:ominoili ions and connivance, atiaft made
np the arrangement â4ad though they <si.>
lot name tlif ablell, they sent the vainej}
man of; ' the thirteen confederated [fates.
The remnant of our dying ciedit was ex
iiaufted support this dignified peribnage
in magnificence and (liow, til! it became
too degrading tp be continued. ' The reft
r>f the acts of his reign, and all that he did,
they are not written in the Chronicles of
the king* of Judah.'
Act's of the Britifli parliament succeeded
thick Upon each other ; all acls of implied,
jr dirett injury, to this country; import
int ports with-heid, tliQugh solemnly re
inquilhed by treaties, undifpnted de
mand*, refufed payment,âall accompanied
with unexampled contempt, and nnqualT
-sed hanghtinefs ; yet, to this hour, have
jni" agents, in whom *ve trulf our honour
and interests, filled theirpockets with these
irritatin / indignities, which the Gentoos
jf Inc!â¢ â  * in, or the broken-hearted defcau
'.iiits iifMunteznina, would and mull have
â¢efented.
To tl.is Hour, it may be remarkedâ Pitch
Vems our infatuation for tfiis old hag of
:ontamin*tion and leprosy : that all the
vealth we acquire, and surplus of all our
nduftry, is poured into her lapâ(upports
ler rank and consequenceâwithout which
he would iniiantly fall into indigcnce,
ivretehednefs, and consumption.
I saw, and lamented, at the close ftf the
ivar, the dangerous consequences of Eng
ifh faihions apd Englifli habits. We im
port their vices wiih their baubles, their
chicanery,with their laws, and their pride,
with their politic*. Their principles, and
heir manners, pervade the feat of govern
ment. the bench of.juftice, and the politer
circles.
Many of our Convention, whoformed the
Conttiuition, were hardy enough, to re
commend a kinjr, a houfi} of lords, and a
bench of bilhops,
Some of our judges have, on a late occa
sion, inltrucled our juries in the courtly
(tyle of Jefi'eries. Our principal ladies
require prcedence & rankâhint distinctions
nf taniiiy, and drink their tea at an Englifli
hour.
I regret the negligence of our Conventi
t>n; they ought to have ordained a Herald's
office ; who knows but it might have
Ihown the of n house of peers;
The very lift of the oid Bailey would have
gone great length?, and cut deeply into
the line of our anctftry.
Perhaps 1 owe an apology to the mi
nister of the French republic, for having
drawn a melancholy picture for his con
templation ; but he wiil pardon me for
having ilated I'aP.s. He must expect the
g. eat men in office, as coid to the inte
rclls of his nation, as they are to those
honest, but negiefcled patriots among us,
who bore the burthen in the heat ot the
day ; their buflnefs is t.o secure the good
will of the rich, who came in at the ele
venth hour. What are the murmurs ol
disbanded soldiers, compared to the ffiiiles
of those who have got their pay. They
must linger in the fliades of ictirement,
tili the drum beats them upon their lege.

But to halanre all these, yon have, c'ti<
zen Minifler, three-fourths of the virtu

peaceably under the Tree of Liberty,
which they have planted fry their courage,
which they have watered with tjieir tears,
and which they will, if neceff.uy, itonrilh
with their blood) will not hrfitate a mo
ment, if called upon, to unite
to their beloved brethren ofFrance against
every hated and malignant clefpot of the
universe. When the Lion ruareth, the
beads of the field tremble; when the
brave & hardy foils of 1775, unsheathed the
Iword, these little drawing-room gentry â
levee hunters, fpecnlators, and excisemen,
who now pester these growing dates about
the importance and mystery ofgoverninent,

inlignificance ; then the honed old general

the grinning attendants of his triflirg, odi

My firft w ilh is, honourable peace; if it

Fellow Citizeni cf Pennjylvahia,
t*7HILE you have been watching the ad
*'â¢ infiltration of tiie i'occieral govern
ment, with a vigilance in the highest degree
jealous and ftifpicious, as if your liberties
were alone vulnerable from that quarter,
you appear to be perfectly indifferent to a
late open and daring violation of your con
ftnirtion by your it-ate legislature. As ii
tyranny in Â« fniall ft-tte, was not more for
midable a;id oppressive and conl'eqneritly
more to be guarded against, than in a large
onr. The truth is, tuat both the general
and (late governnu r.t ought equally to
lliaTi our attention. While you are wrang
ling about the interpretation ot treaties
and the conduit of the ambassadors.you
are incouliderately and absurdly (uflerinj
vonr own constitution to be trampled upon
with impunity and unconcern : and yci
vour constitution is the only security (u:i
---lc! < a civil war be expeitcd) you have a
iramlt the horrible inroads of defpotilm.
By the Bth article ot your excellent con
stitution the members ot the general af
(Vmbly &c. shall be bound uy oath or aJir
inatio 1, to support the constitution of this
Commonwealth, and to perform the duties
of their respective offices with fidelity.
In the 9th article, are enumerated those
powers, which, the people or convention
diti not think fife to delegate.
In the 17th lection 01 the 9th article, it
is expresily provided that, no Expojt-facto
iaw, or any law impairing contract?
(hail be nude; and the words in the lail
fectian of the fame article are intended U
guard against violations of the high power:
ilien delegated to them, we further de
claring that, every tiling in this article not
expres'ly delegated, is excepted out of the
general powers of jroverniiieiit and dial,
tor ever remain inviolate.
The general affenibly met the firft Thurf
day in December 1 sit, took their feats, and
aÂ£ted nnder a known law (which was cer
tainly an affciit to it and became a contrail
011 fheii part to comply with it untili alter
ed, whicl alteration could only regaic
their fuaire services) for about 3 months
at 2 dollars per day, when tkey palled ar
Expoftfacto law to pay th.-mfelies 3 dol
lars per day from the commencement c;
their fitting. Mow an Expofl fatlo law i
a law, which '1 Triads to operate ai;d pr< â 
dace effetts prev'oujly to the t'vie of its be
> j) enacted: as the one now alluded to
which wasjnadeto have the force of lav,
or 3 months orthere about before it wa:
palled. But two laws, interfering with,
and contradicting each other cannot botl
be i i operation at the fame time. It 1
admitted on all fides that the si. ft law
which entitled the members of the alleHibl;
to 2 dollars perday and for which they ac
tually did fei-ve their coiiftituents for abau:
3 months, was in as fail force as any otliei
law whatever, untili altered or repealed
And not withstanding this rational concef
lion, without which no government coulc
exist the aflembly absurdly, feifi;h:y, incieli
cat- y and unconstitutionally pals a law
which they decree fiiall operate to pa)
themfelv 3 dollars per d y from the be
ginning c*.he session; that is to alter 01
repeal a law three months before it coulc
be altered or repealedâBut if they can dc
this for 31110 Whs they can for 3 year*âand
there is no end to the absurdity.
When \ye refieft that, \\e have in rea
ality to support the b:irt)ien and expence:
of two governments the foederal and state,
we cannot be too severe in our strictures,
upon fnch a felfifti mifappiication of tht
finances of the state.
But it is not so much the expence ol
this additional dollar, however extrava
gant and confequeiitly, cenfureable it ma)
be in itfelf, that we ought to dread : there
ii a rauch more formidable danger to be ap
prehended and against which we cannot be
too much upon our guard. It is immate
rial wii'-ther any particular violation 01
the constitution be in itfelf trivial and un
important. Every part of the conflitutior
claiming its inviolability from the fan;<
sanction viz. the authotity of th; ptoplt
there is 110 pÂ«rt ot it more lacred than tht
reft. If the legislature violate it in an)
one instance, they may with the f?me pro
priety in any other : inafmuthas they-It
but violate the fame fanftion aud trample
upon the fame authority, to which the)
are indebted tor their power and for theii
exiltence.
The members of Montgomery county, i;
b true, alledged that they voted against tht
law. lam afraid that they gave it but t
feeble opposition, and that they were toe
willing to be overpowered. VVhy else di<
they not enter their protest against it ? 1
have already proved that this pretendec
law was unconstitutional. andthatit woulc
have been equaiiy so, whether it allowed
them lor 20 dollars per day. But they
i oted against itâDid the y vote against it ai
the Tieafury ? they equally with its advo
cates, pocketed the 3 dollars per day from
i heir firft fitting, although they had but a
little before lolemnly contended that it
was unconstitutional, or at least {for they
11111 ft hpve founded their eppofition upon
one of these realons) that their services
to the public would have been fufiiciently
nd amply compensated by the former
law.
But uo doubt they and the reft of the
minority, thought it,their duty to fubrnitto
the majority : and I may faftly fay, that in
no i-liance was this good maxim molt
rigidly or more wiifingLy adhered to.
But, my fellow citizens, if what 1 have
Hated appears to you to be true, rnd 1
hare reason to think that you agree witii
nfe in opinion, you have at least one reme
dy in your hands.âNo longer trust thoft
men, who have had the temerity to abuff
your confidence, and trample upon the
constitution, the only bulwark of your li
berties.
A Montgomery Farmer.
P, S. I am informed that a motion has
been made in the Afli'mbly, to repeal this
law, and a committee appointed to re
port upon it. II ihey do repeal it, do you
imagine it will mention any thing about
refunding?
NoâNoâThat would be clearly ejepoft
facto and unconftitutional âBe not deceiv
ed ; it is merely an electioneering ma
noeuvre.

From the gen-eral afpefl j>{ the London

of 6eing effected. From our own former

membered, that (luring the American u ar,
the Royal Gazette, at New- York, detailed
I'carcely any thing else but a conllant fuc
c-efiion of tiie molt brilliant victories gained
by the king's troops for upwards of seven
years ; and even Cornwallis's capture was
by fi.-ne of the royaliffs, interpreted into
a fignalbleffiilg to the arms of Great-Bri
tain, and their glorious monarch.
An American vcfl'el was, in June last.
captured by a French privateer, out of
Nantz, and fix of her hands, with a mate,

feiimen sued the privateer, and obtained
damages for their detention, their wages
from the time of their capture, until they
should reach a port of the United States,
their pafiage, and all cofis of suit to he paicl
by tiie privateer, who belides forfeits forty

THE attempts con!rautly making tr,
an abandoned arillocratic faction tc
embroil the Uni'ed Staff 6 with Frs.nct
cannot but excite our serious apprehenli
inn. It has become a common laying, at
lead with this faction, and their adher
ents the tones, that if we must have war,
it had better hi, with France than Great
Britain. The firfr, thev fay, is already
overwhelmed with foes, vv hi lit the latter hr.s
r.o enemy but Franceâas to the cause o:
liberty in which our generous allies are
engaged, it you mention this as a reafor
lor at lead within;; them well, you ar<
flared at as a madman, or laughed out o:
countenance as a f<ditious democrat
While theft fentimen'.s prevail in some c:
our sea ports, which are crowded wi l
contemptible adventurers from Great Bri
tain, it must be observe lto the honor o:
the American character, that the great
body of people with one voice and one
heart unite in wishing well to the Frenct
revolution. It cannot however be con
fealed that many late publications, anc
we m?y add many meafuret of govern
ment, have a Undency to involve us in <
war with the only free nati n on earth
Among "this kind of publications may bj
claffeil those under the figna'.ure of Paci
ficus.âThtffe tffivs have been induftri
oufly republiPiK'd in every city on tin
continent and with some others of tlr<
f ore eomplexion, are attributed to tht
iây of the t ây. Under a pr.tence o
vindicating the President's proclamation
they contain a most infamous libel on tin
French nation. The treaty is frittered
into a dead letter, every measure of thf
revolutionills is vilified, and praise i:
bellowed only on a worthless traitor whe
endeavored to.betray his-trull In hii
next number we may expect an eulogiurr
on Dumoiirier, who certainly deserve;
well of the ariilocratic part of mankinc
for his attempts to betray a nation of re
publicjns.âAmericans, beware ! whsr
fitch fentimeftts are inculcated from thf
profsâwhen a nation to whom you owe
your it-dependence, is publicly vilified ar.c
traduced, and for no other rea'on v thar
because she has unrtieathed the fwcrc
ngainft tyranny, an attack upon your owr
liberties cannot be distant. I might point
out several measures of government which
have the (atne pernicious tendency of em
broi ing us with France, but it would bs
very inconvenient just now to be indicted
in the federal court for a libel, which ap
pellation might easily be given by a cun
ning federal bench to any enquiry irttc
the mei-fures of government.âThejudges
have good salaries, and as they are cer
tain of enjoyinf them while the govern
ment lads, I fiiouid not like to have my
liberty or purse at tlie mcrcy of theit in
terpretation of the doctrine of libels. But
for this well grounded appreheniion, we
might aflc why was Henfield indicted :
was it not to pleale Hammond and \ex
Genet? or in plain English, was it not to
court Great Britain, and to irritate
France? Would lie have been indicted il
he had served on board the Bolton in hei
late conflict with the Ambuscade ? In
fneh a cafe Pacifi us would have proved
from Vattel, that there was a material
difference between serving on board of a
royal and a republican frigate The
whole bench of federal juuges may be
with all thehr leisure, to hunt
for cases, to produce a iingle ii stance of an
individual of a nation at peace being in
dicted for voluntarily entering into the
service of one at war. (Too much pfjife
cannot be given to the virtuous and patri
otic jury who acquitted Henfi.ld, and by
{heir verdict have confirmed to every A
mericau citizen a right which fubjefts,
even under a despotic monarchy, have
hitherto enjoyed without interruption. J
Henfield was scarcely acquitted wHen
the press labored with libels againll citi
zen Genet. Anonymous signatures were
adopted, and a chics jullice and a senator
of the United States quickly offered their
aid in support of publications replete with
abuse of this worthy character. In the
very ast of coming forward they ou l raged
not only citizen Genet, but decency,com
mon feufe and their fellow citizensâln
flead of- disclosing the whole truth, tl.ey
related only what suited their own purpose
and the views of a base party. Mr Genet
has observed a dignified iilente. Well
knowing he could acquire no credit by
calling them to a personal account, he
djfdained to enter into a nefpaper contro
vet'fy with themâWhether hit rep.ublic
will resent die indignity, is yet to be af
certhined ; in the person of our m r
at Paris they never will. He is below
their contempt; liis chara&er is as well
known there, as it is in this country, yet
such is the respect paid to the Un ted
States by this infant, but great republ c,
that wliile they execrate the ariftocrr.lic
principles, and attempts of our m r,
a guard isplaced at his door to prevent any
insult from the revolutionills. If the U
niied States are the object of their refent
raent, in what situation will a declaration
of war, find themâFrance has a fleetâ
we have noneâWe have a commerce â
France has noneâThe sea ports of- France
are well fortifiedâours are defencelefsâ
The armies of France will consist of
freemen, and enthusiasts in the canfc
as libertyâours, if we have any,
will be composed of despicable arifto
crat3 and tories, for not a real whig will
draw his sword in so wicked a caufc,
And yet in this defencelefs situation,
which is a disgrace to admini(lration,are we
provoking a power which has withstood,
and will Â»anquifh, (notwithstanding the
prayers of Pacificus and his adherents to
:he contrary) the combined force ot
E Jtope.
The forcible seizure of fevera! French
prizes, with oilier fl grant inflations of
our treaties with Francs, will be consider
ed hereafter.
Americans ! be on vour guard ; the
detestation of the French revo'ution,
which is become so fsfhionable among
those in office, results from :Â«n affection
for monar. hy Under this form of go
vernment their salaries will not only
be encreafed, but perhaps perpetua
ted. That inany, even of those who
formerly passed for patrio's, (while they

execrable form of government in contem

NEW-PORT, ~ (R I.) Aug. 13.
" ON the 13th of July lad arrived
here the merchant ship Catharine, Wil
liam James Davis, master, from Ja
maica,for New-Brunfwick, mounted with
8 cannpn and a number of wooden guns,
but not comrniflioned ; and navigated by
16 men, with a 1 niall caYgo, and fevera
pafTengers with their servants, and a large
quantity of baggage, which he had con
trailed to land at Sandy Hook, or in this
port. y
On the 31ft he entered his vefTel, anc
propoftd to enter his cargo.âln the
forenoon -of the next day.. the judge o:
the ditfrifl. court was informed, that capt
Davis had, off Cape Hatteras, violently
entered a flocp, callcd the Rainbow,
Mackay, matter, belonging to citizens oi
the United States, and bound from Cape
Francois to Philadelphia, with a number
of French pafTengers on board, whom lit
robbed of several bags of money j and
that one of the pafTengers of the Catharine,
if called upon, would attest to the truth
of this information. The judge immedi
ately took meafnres to obtain his testimo
ny. âHe appeared, and, aficr his deposi
tion was taken, had liberty to be absent
three quarters of an hour, while a fait
copy of it was making out, when he en
gaged to return, and swear to
the truth of it. But ir.flead of returning
Â»t the lime fixtd, by the interference of <
gentleman, whole duty it could not be tc
letain the witness, but whose duty it wai
:o discountenance any violation of the
neutrality, fubfjfting between the United
States and Great Britain, he did not re
urn till two hours and a half had elapsed,
when he fubferibed and made oath to the
deposition. The judge, in the mean time,
cad drawn a warrant for apprehending
capt. Davis ; and notwithstanding the
time which had been confirmed in taking
a iong deposition, the delay occafiorted in
the manner hinted, and some delay caused
by an improper meddling of the gentle
man referred to about the time the depo
sit ion was sworn te, the warrant was de
livered to the deputy marshal at 8 o'clock
in the evening, with positive directions to
execute it immediatelyâHe it seems
thought bed to defer the buflnefs intruded
to him till tlie next morning ; but desired
the captain of the fort to keep a good
look out, and to fire upon the flrip if The
(hould attempt to pass. Between ten and
eleven o'cl. ck, the wind, which had been
southerly, fuddenlv fhifted to the north
ward, and blew frefh. The (hip's cable
was flipt or cut, and she was under way.
The captain of the tort fired at her as
scon as she was in motion, aad repeated
lifs fire ; tut tlie battery bein* out of
repair, the fire could not be continued,
arid (be was soon out of fight and the
reach of the cannon ; and thus, by the
interference and intermeddling hinted at,
and the remiflnefs of the deputy mar thai,
1 culprit, who had violated the laws of
neutrality and humanity, was fufFered, if
not encouraged, to rfcape the punishment
due to his crimes. He carried along with
him his paflengers' baggage, and servants.
The passengers have declared they spoke
with the Briiilh frigate called the Bolton,
commanded by capt. Courtrey, who" in
formed that he had conic from Halifax,
armed at all points, to take the Ambus
cade, to whom capt. Davis delivered one
of the bags of monev, to the amount Â©1
850 dollars, of which l.e had robbed the
unhappy French.
The diftrift judge lias since taken the
deposition of the other paflTengers, which
agree in substance j and we presume has
transmitted all of them, and '.he other pa
pers, to the Prcfident of the United States,
who will without doubt, treat this fee
rolbery as it deserves. Viewing this mat
ter in a national light, I shall forbear any
abf rvations on the atrocity of the crime,
considered in that view ; and only makt
a (hort remark on the cruelty of Davis.
I do not believe that the history of pi
rates, furnilhes an inflance of persons
being robbed by them of their property
who had ef. ped from the recent destruc
tion of their country ; and had nothing
to support them, but what they had
hatched from its ruins. Blulh Britain,
that one of thy for.s should be gi ilty oi
such unexampled barbarity ; blush, and
revenue the wrong !
The account we have given is from in
formation but we have reason to think it is
true ; and it is communicated with a view
to correct the misapprehensions, whicl;
Tome entertain of this tranfa&ion.
It is a vulgar proverb, but it is just,
'' Ltl the fuddle be pl. ced on the rtgh,
borfe."
