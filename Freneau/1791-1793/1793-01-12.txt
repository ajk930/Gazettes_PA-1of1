Fellow Cit i zkm,
AS a freeman, sincerely interefled in
the welfare of my country, 1 am
bound to addfefs you. Your republican
principles and deportment put me at ease
on the fcoie of this address; for although
I have not the pleaftire of being perfon
s,lly known to you, I am convinced from
the general terror of your conduit, that
you will liltcH to the voice of every free
man, however objeure he may be, or how
ever deficient in what is lately termed
consequence, provided he comes forward
to you recommended by honed princi
ples, republican conduit, and love for his
country. As an individual I have no
thing to a(k, for thanks to my God, ai;
independent profeffion has removed nu
from th?.t state of pioditution whfch is ne

Sir, the veil is almost rent which over

they have viewed with the eye of affec

FOREIGN AFFA IR S.
PARIS, Nov. 13.
ExtraS from Gen. Dum'jitis :cttef to tht
National Convention, giving a fiOrticu
lir account oj the battle with ihc /.nj
trians, on the 6th oj November.
" IN the morning I ordered out II
pieces of cannon 16 pounders, 12 twelv<
pounders, and 12 howitzer*, to be planted
along the front of my line. Genera
i'Harville, polled on the lieights of Ci
phy, flanked the enemy's left, whiiil I at
tacked the right, taking from them agair
the village cfCarignon bythe Belglc corps
supported by nine battalions under tht
command of M.jors Central Ferrand,
Roziere, and Bloifiere. The centre ol
the attack composed of jR battalions, was
under the command of lieutenant Gene
ral Egalite (the eldell son of the Duke
of Orlean ) and Majors General Staten
bolfr, Deslorets, and Drouets. Ihe
right, contilling of the advanced guard,
was commanded by Lieutenant Genera;
Bournonville and Major Gemral Dampi
erre. Gener.il d'Harville could afllfk us
in the attack, only with his cannon, his
division being at too g'eat a dillance from
the enemy's entrenchments, to be able tc
engage.
" The Austrian army, on the lowett
computation, confided of 20,C00 men.
viz. 16,500 foot and 3,500 horseâOthers
ellimatcd their numbers at 28,000.
"We had not more than 30,000 fight
ing men. The position of the enemy
was truly formidable. Their right was
to the village of Genneppe, and their left
to the road leading to Valenciennes. Theii
whole was polled on a chain of heights,
overspread with clumps of trees; three
tiers of redoubts rose as in an amphithea
tre, one above another, maintaining in all
at least 20 pieces of heavy cannon, and as
many howitzers, whilll each battullion had
3 field pieces ; so that the enemy had neat
one hundred gun*, which they could bring
to bear upon us. We had as many to
play upon them. But the elevation of
their batteries would have given them a
great advantage over ours, it we had been
i Joked to riik the fate of the day upor,
our.vrtfllerv.
" My troops, full of confidence in their
awn bravery, had expressed to me their
most earnest wish to come to close action
ivith the Auftrians. I had entire confi
dence in their resolution, for in all the
movements which I had made them make
under the enemy's fire, I saw that they
-narched and went through the evolutions
is on a field day; but particularly on
he three preceding days, when I could
lot but admire the coolness and precision
with which they executed all the manoeu
vres which I had planned.
" A hot .cannonnade began on both
ides, at 7 o'clock in the morning, and
aftpd till ten ; at which time, I was not
ible to perceive that our success was
r uch as to make it eligible to confine my
felf to that fpccies of attack âWhilst I
irifited the different paits of my lhre, the
troops expressed their impatience to push
sayonets with the enemy. General Bour
nonville and General Egalite had repeat
idly proposed the fame measure. I re
trained their ardour, only, that I might
Dake its exertion the more vigorous :
: or it was my plan ultimately, to tlorm
:he redoubts. In the mean time, how
ler, I contented myfelf with ordering the
irtillery to be pushed nearer to the Auf
trians, that it might have the greater cf
;eÂ£t ; and I ordered an attack upon the
, llage of Caiignon, because I could not
".ill upon G 1 nHi cope on that fide, withbui
being firll mailer of the village.
" I sent Colonel Thouvenot, my Adju
tant General, an offic r of the highelt
nerit, with orders to direst the attack, and
;arrv all the right flank of the enemy.
[ desired General d'Harville to advance
lis batteries nearer to them, that the great
:r execution might be made upon theii
eft. I ordered Gen. Bournonville to dc
he like, and be ready for the attack, pre
:ifrly at noon. I difpatchtd similar or
ders to the left, because I calculated we
hould by that time be mailers of Carig
ion, which it was necessary we fliouh
lave in our possession, as the left of ni}
ine attacked might be turned if that vil
age was to continue in the power of thi
;nemy.
" Precisely at twelve o'clock at noon
the whole of the infantry formed in co
umns in the tw : nkling of an eye, and ad
vanced with the greatest rapidity and a
lacrity towards the enemy's works ; noi
i fingleheadof a column remained be
lind.
" The firft tier of redoubts was imme
liately carried with the greatest vivacity
3uc soon the difficulties and obstacles en
sealing, the centre was in some danger
ind I law some of the enemy's horse rea
3y to enter the plain, to charge the co
umns in flank. I instantly difpatchec
thither Lieut. General Egalite, who, b)
lis cool bravery, quickly rallied the co
â umnÃ, and led thein to the second tier o.
redoubts. I ordered the third regiment
afChaffeurs, and the sixth of HulTars tc
support this attack, who arrived very a
pro-pos to make head againll, and charg(
the enemy's cavalry. I repaired at the
fame time to the tight, where I foxnc
that Gen. Bournonville,having turned ant
carried the redoubts, met with complett
success ; his horse had been thrown intc
some disorder, whilst he was busily em
ployed at the head of his infantry. I
quickly rallied them, and they inilantl)
charged with the greatest vigonr the ene
my's horse, who had already reached oui
right flank. Whilst c.ur cavalry was ral
lying, a body of the enemy's horse attemp
ed to break the Hi ft battalion of Pari;
volunteers, who received them with flea
[Total No. 126.]
dinefs, and with a (ingle discharge killed
sixty men !
" In the interval of this action on the
right, our left had carried the village of
Genneppe, and our centre had stormed
and taken the second tier of redoubts ;
we ft ill had another battle to fight before
we could become mailers of the iaft tier;
but it v?as neither as long or as hot as the
former ; the AulTriana being fiiled with
conllernation at the exploits performed by
the obllinate and (till encrealiog bravery
oT our troops.
Â«' At two o'clock they retreated in the
greatest disorder, leaving us in poflefuon
of the ground which they had occupied,
and which was covered with the killed of
both parties. Their loss was so consider
able, and their conflernation so great,
that they pafled through the city of Mons,
without once halting ; neither did tiiev
fialt at Berthomen, or Mount Palifele, or
:ven on the heights of Nieicy.
" I led the whole vi&oripui army to
:he height of the Village ofCufm 'S, where
[ placed some infantry, and found one
thirteen pounder. I colleded there fotr.e
wounded, and deferteis. The fame d3y
[ sent a detachment under Gen. d'Har
rilie, to take post on Mount Palifele, and
mother ur.der Gen. Stetenbolfe, to take
possession of Bartellement.
" I sent a summons to the city of Mons
:o surrender, and a parley took place, of
.vhich I inclose the particulars. The
:roops, though they had fearcely closed
m eye for three days, and had not been
ible to prepare any dinner 08 the day of
:his terrible battle, pretTed me nevertha
efs to let them march to Mons, and take
:he town by escalade. I told them they
llooid haT* that fatiefaitioo the r.-e.-.t day;
ind I accordingly took proper measures
r or completing the circumvallation of the
;ity, and attacking it in several places at
jnce. But â¦he enemy availed themselves
jf the night, and evacuate 1 it: the last
joo men of the garrison left it at nine
i'clock the next morning.
<< I was making preparations for plant
ng my batteries, when the inhabitants,
sfter having broke open the gates, which
lad been closed by the Auftrians, came
r orth and invited me to enter their city/
which I immediately did. I found the
nagiftrates at the gates lo receive me ;
hey offered me the keys of Mons : lay
ng my hand upon them, I told them we
were come as friends and brethren, to
aerfuade them to keep their gates always
ihut against their old oppressors, and to
kfend the liberty which we had just pro
ved therii.
Â«' This ever memorable event covers
France with immortal glory. There is
lot in the whale army a battalion, or
'quadron, or even a single individual, who
las not been in close engagement with
the enemy. You are already well ac
quainted with the abilities and bravery
as Gen. Bourncnville. All the other Ge
nerals, particularly Gen. Egalite, (hewed
the greatest judgment in leading on the
army. The field officers and aid-de camps
carried my orders with the greatest acti
vity and precition, through the midst of
the rtjoft dreadful fire and (laughter.â
General Drouet has had a leg broke by a
mufltet (hot, Colonel Claumont, Adjutant
General, was (hot through the arm, and
had his horse killed under him. Gen.
Ferrand received a contusion in the leg,
and had his horse killed. Adjutant Gen.
Monfoy was (hot in the mouth, and has
seven of his teeth knocked out. Col Du
bourret is badly wounded, as is Citizen
Lieutenant Berlicke, of the National
Gendarmerie, who received 41 wounds
(all given with broad fvvords) after he
had with his own hand killed 7 of the
enemy. Citizen Laffi (Tes. Lienteflant
Colonel of the two battalians of the twa
Sevres, had his arm b:oke by a mulkec
iTiot. Several other officers aud soldiers
have been killed and woundsd." I am not exactly acquainted v. ith thi
amount of our lols, but I estimate it at a
bout 300 killed, and 600 wounded. I
will fend you a more exact account, as
loon as I receive the regular returns from
die different corps. The enemy have 101 l
eight guns, taken by Gen. Bournonville's
advanced guard, and three in our-attack of
their left. Our gunners maintained their
reputation for bravery and ll'.lll, so much
dreaded by our enemies.
" The Auftrians have loft in killed,
wounded, and deserters, at lead 4000 men,
exclusive of almost as many more miffing,
and disbanded, some of whom we are evei"y
hour picking up.
" Such is the detail of this battle, which
may be considered a? decisive of the con
uueft of the Netherlands ; for the Auftri
ans will not again venture to measure their
strength with u: in a pitched battle ; in
this last, we have (hewn them that the uni
ted refburces of (ituatioii and art are not
able toraife a barrier too strong for French
bravery to pull down.
" The bearer of these dispatches, is
Lieutenant-Colonel Lame, my aid-de
camp, a man of the greatest intrepidity.

LONDON, Nov. 20.
If the French (hould offer to attack Hol
land, after over-running the Austrian Ne
therlands, it is probable that a conliderable
number of Briti(h troops will be sent to the
assistance of the United Provinces, to op
pose the progress of the French arms,
which may eventually engage this country
in a war with that power.
Orders have been sent to Woolwich to
complete the two battalions of artillery
now in' England, with the utmost polTible
expedition : and recruiting parties are to
be immediately difpatchedto every part of
Great-Britain for that purpose.
On the 13th of September last, afire
broke out at Constantinople, which com
pletely consumed 6000 houses, 6000 shops,
5 mosques, numberless ware-houses, and
100 noble buildings, the relidence of the
principal miniflers, great officer;, and ge
nerals of the Porte.

Dr. Rufli has remarked, can be politically

the payment of a debt of gratitude until it
is demanded, is to be truly ungrateful ;
for when the service is properly eltimated,
we anticipate of those who have

It will scarcely be denied that Frnnce

ful claims, but exert every means in our
power to succour her ? I blu(h for my
country, which is laid to be the relidence
of freemen, when I rededt, that a motion
to discharge this honest debt, a part of the

at the Republic, (I will not insult freemen
by faying the court of France,) "if we dis
charge this debt now we may be obliged
to pay it again": (hameful and difgraceful
caution, an opprobrium upon our country,
and worthy only of the reptiles of change
alley, or of a land broker âHad this been
the language of our faithful allies in the
period of onr diltreffe?, what would have
been the confeqnence ? Was our indepen

loan would ever be repaid ? Ungrateful
Americans, and from such conduct unwor
thy of freedom ! Should the treasury of
the United States be emptied into the lap
of France, it would not cancel the obliga

nature and nature's God entitled them to,

December last, (No. 119.)
" IN vain, fays Mr. Otfego, have his
(Governor Clinton's) partizans explained
away his opinions, in vain have they tried
to throw a veil over his aitions. 111 spite
of all their endeavours antifederalifm, am
bition, and ani:ifatiable thirst fur the emo
luments of office are plainly discernible."
Here is another very evident mifipplica
tion of terms, for not his partizans, but his
oppefers, have endeavoured to expiain a
way his opinions ; thole who, while they
usurp the name of republicans, would frit
ter and explain away the molt eilentfal
principles of a free government ; who,
while they profefs themselves friend? to the
rights of man, openly oppose a formal de
claration of thole rights ; \lilo, while they
pretend a warm attachment to the Hate
governments, are for attachingall the pow
ers of government to the general one, so
as to render them merely formal and use
less inftitutiona ; who instead of securing
the rights and liberties of the people, by
eftablilhing proper checks againlt the abu
ses of power, are for eltablilhing powers
independent of the people, as checks against
their rights and liberties. These are the
men who would fain explain away his opi
nions and principles. Not those who think
that a proper bill or declaration of rights,
and a suitable degree of power rcferved in
the state governments, where the peo
ple have a full and a fafe representation,
would be much better balances to the ge
neral government, and more proper and
effectual chccks againlt its opprefTions, than
an hereditary monarch and house of lords
at the head of it: Not those who think
that government is made for the people,
and not the people for government, and

His oppofers also, isnd not his partizans,
would be glad, was it in their power, to
throw a veil over his actions. For they
have been as uniform and unequivocal as
his opinions and principles, and I believe
both will bear the left sf the flrictelt fern
tiny and investigation. Both in his opini
ons and praÂ£tice he has disco*. ered a steady
adherence to the equalizing principles
whish governed our councils and conduct
in the year seventy-six, when aristocratic
pride and ambition durst not shew it: head.
The man who in that day would have pub
lished doctrines, and pursued measures,
which are now preached up and pursued
by the opponents of the partizans of Go
vernor Clinton, would have betn confin
ed as one whose going at large would have
been dangerous to the liberties of the
country.
As to the charges of antifederalifm, am
bition, and third for the emoluments of
office, they cannot be all true, because
they are inconiiilent with each other; for
if he is an antifederal in the sense the au
thor would insinuate he i? opposed to a go
vernment, which alone can gratify the
cravings of ambition, or any very great
\ thirst after the emoluments of office. The
state governments were not formed upon
the plans of ambition ; and it is to be hop
ed that the adminiltration of them will ne
ver become so corrupted as to make the e
moluments of office defireable objefrs ei
ther to avarice or luxury, neither of which
ought to be admitted to participate in the
administration of a republican government.
It is the general government alone, if a
ny, in this country, which can support that
pomp and fhew,that mimickry o: lordliness
and royalty, which is the general pursuit of
ambition : and it is this alone which can
annex such emoluments to offices, as will
attract the notice of the avaricious or of
the extravagant. Hence it is evident, that
where either ambition or a thirst for the
emoluments of office, are the ruling pafli
ons, they 11111 ft produce an attachment for
the general government, and form what is
called a federalift ; for it is better to be a
door keeper in the House of Congress, than
to fit on the throne of government iu some
of the states.

On Wednesday morning last Mr. Blan

ascension from the jail-court in this city.
He took his departure precisely at ten mi

landed, after three attempts, in Glouces

ladelphia, and from thence was escorted
back to town by several gentlemen, where
he arrived at fix in the evening. He sup
posed his greatest perpendicular height
from the earth to have been about two

Two persons were lately apprehended
in New-York (city) for attempting to

of one of his boots was found a plate tor
striking 50 dollar notes, with 29 bills of
that value, finilhed and lignrd. In the foal
of the other boot were Gxty-feven bank
bills, not signed. In his pocket book was
found another 50 dollar bill, and apiece
.cf poetry. It is to be lamented that all
the paper, found upon this unfortunate
man, was not of the latter denomination.
A number of emigrants ar.d transient
persons from the French \\ eft-Indies have

their negro {laves attending them might noi

report of the committee on this fubjecl
was unfavorable to the petitioners, and
they had leave to withdraw their peti

A letter from a gentleman in Boston,
mentions that a European vefiel had arri

that a grand Congress was to be formed or
the continent, for negotiating a peace ;
and, that the National of France, are tc

it had been determined to recal the Frenci
armies within the frontier, and the enemj
to evacuate the entire line from Dunkirk
to Geneva.
We are informed, that the inhabitants oi

are erroneous.
The great object of that gentleman ir
offering his calculations to the house, was
to fnew a prodigious progrellive encreafi
in the espenccs of the war department
since the cftablifiiment of the new govern
ment. For this purpose he had comparer
what he dated as the appropriations o
the years 1790, 1791, and 1792 with oni
another, and with the sum now called so:
from that department for the year 1793
Mr- Wadfworth proceeded to shew thi
inaccuracy of the gentleman in this at
tempt, by the following statement :
Mr. Steele stated that for 1790 the ap
propriations for the quarter-mailer's de
partment amounted to 15,000 Dols.

From the foregoing the inaccuracy ol
Mr. Steele's statements, and of the calcu
lations founded on them were evident.â
The prodigious rapid encreafe of the war
department expences did not appear,
and the gentleman's favlng plan, founded
on the difference of the appropriation for
1792 and the sum edimated for 93 proved
very ti id ng indeed, amounting to a few
thoufand6 only.
Mr. VVadfworth said he did not posi
tively pledge himfelf for the absolute accu
racy of his datements; but if there were
errors in them he ventured to fay they
were but trifling.
He next took notice of Mr. Steele's ar
guments relative to the ordnance depart
ment From what had been said by that
gentleman on (his he truly thought, as he
had expressed it, that the bufincfs bore a
ludicrous appearance : but on further en
quiry, by looking over an account of the
expenditures of the war department, it
appeared that the large sums appropriated
for the ordnance department, far from be
ing expended in the purchase of cannon,
not one {lulling had gone to that use, it
was all for repairs to arms, &c. The
statement of the gentleman in this parti
cular he could not conceive confident with
candor.
As the gentleman from North Caroli
na reded his aflertiou of abuses in the war
department, on the statements he had pro
duced, these aflertions he conceived, he
fufficiently answered, by shewing the state
ments mis-stated.
Mr. Wadfworth referred to parts of the
Secretary at War's reports to flicw that
that officer had been in favor of conciliato
ry, and averse to hodile measures with the
Indians, to another part to diow liis opi
nion where and how militia were effective.
He next turned to the causes of the
war. The edablifhment of a war depart
ment was, in his opinion, by no means, as
had been suggested, the cause of the In
dian war, but rather the effect. The war
exided before the edablilhment of the pre
sent government âit is ail inheritance from
the old confederation and so is the war de
partment. The hidory of its origin and
progress was in record, and might he tra
ced by a reference to the resolves of Con
gress. The war exided in 1784. A
communication received some years back
from the executive of Georgia would e
vince its exidence and shew its violence.
The executive complained that the fron
tier was too thinly fettled, and some coun
ties broken up, and ordered out 3000
men to protest itâsince that even the ci
ty of Savannah was, he had heard, so fe
riondy threatened, that the citizens were
obliged to keep guard in itâand this be
fore the present war system.
Neither could the present mode of car
rying 011 the war be called the creature of
the war department. It was rather the
President's warâor the war indeed of the
lioufe, the war of the legislature ; the plan
was a good one as the experience of the
President in these wars made him a proper
judge; it had his approbation and we
know it.
He mentioned several indances of the
cruelty of the whites towards the Indians,
healfo stated the information of Judge In
nis of the depredations of the Indians ; the
single didritt of Kentucky had loft from
1783 to 1790, 1500 men, women and
children, killed and taken, with 2000 hor-
Fes and other property, amounting to at
lead 50,000 dollars, and to these he attri
buted the war in which wc were involved.
The hidory of the settlement of Kentuc
ky, if recurred to, would affoid a series of
:aufes of Indian hodilities.
He next proceeded to examine the opi
nion advanced of the superiority of militia
over regular forces in an Indian war. He
recurred to hidory to disprove the opinion.
So early as the year after Braddock's de
feat, he said, Virginia attempted to pro
test itfelf against the incursions of the In
dians by edablilhing a number of polls a
long their frontier. The Indians, not
withdanding, penetrated the frontier,
came 60 miles within it and drove the inha
bitants as far as Winchester, In the war
which lucceeded the peace of 62, garri
sons, T4 or 15 in number, were edablifhed,
to afford the wished for protection ; they
were all captured by the Indians, 3 or 4
excepted. The Pennfylvnnia frontier had
been more than once penetrated notwith-
Ilanding the refidance of the militia. He
next cited the indance of Col. Bouquet's
luccefs against the Indians with only two
regiments of regular troops, which had e
fen been much weakened by a long cam
paign in the Weft-Indies. These two re
giments marched into the Indian country:
A.t fird, finding no kind of support on
:he frontier, and when arriving at Csrlifle
where he expedted to be aided by (lores,
troops, See. he found a general panic had
taken pofleflion of the frontierâthe coun
ty of Cumberland through which he was
to pass, deserted; the roads covered with
diltrefTed families; but here having got to
gether a few pack horses he flood in need
of, he (till advanced with the few troops
under his command, & gave the Indians
battle. Thecombat lasted from one o'clock
till night, was renewed the next morning,
continued thro' the day and ended with
the total rout and deftruftion of the Indi
an army. He then stationed his force in
a commanding fort, and so effectually re
ft-ored peace to the frontier and foirit to the
inhabitants that they returned to their
homes, which they had abandoned and
lent their afiiftance against the foe the next
campaign With the militia of Virginia
and Pennsylvania he entered the heart of
the enemies country and forced the Indi
ans to fubmifilon. He cited another in
ilance of the success of Indians against mi
â¢'itij. The engagement between Bco mi
litia, under General Herkemer and 700
Indians, and others, where a total over
throw was given to the militia.
The firft check the lroop3 of the United
States met with during the operation of the
present war system he adverted to, âin the
expedition under General Harmar. In
that instance the want of vigour in the mi
litia, is acknowledged by their own cam
mander ; and as to the expedition under
Gen. St. Clair, the regulars were few and
not to be named when compared with the
number of the militia. The advanced
giiaid, in this action, composed entirely of
these.not only run off without firing but e
ven threw away their guns and perhaps
their coats too, which circumftance-inayac
count for the appellation of coat men, giv
en to our men by the Indians.
He next took notice of a late instance,
the engagement between Major Adair,
commanding a party of militia, and some
Indians. He txpreffed his good opinion
of that officer, but the conduct of his men
he wished to bring to view ; and this iie
evinced from the commander's own letter
wherein he fays, â¢' that the Indians ob
tained their end, the triumph is theirs,"
and in another place, " I will candidly
confefs, when thev retreated, the Indians, I
believe, it was more the effect of choice
than necessity."
Mr. Wadfworth then combated the opi
nion advanced, that Indian expeditions by
militia, were less expenlive than by regular
troops; after mentioning several facts to
the contrary, he inltanced general Clark's
western expedition which had c ;ft, he was
not prepared to fay how much, but im
mense sums. He appealed to gentlemen
who had commanded militia and continen
tals in the late war to declare which ap
peared to them the most efficient troops â
the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Parker)
who had spoken in favour of the resolution
before the houfc, he said in one inflance in
the late war, if he recollected right, had no
great reason to boast of his companions
He mentioned, as the cxpence,
the walte of (tores, inseparable from cxpe
ditions with militia, as well as walle of
lives.
The settlement of Kentucky, he said,
which had been prote&ed by militia, had
cost more blood than the whole American
war, he believed. If the number of live 3
loft in that undertaking could be compu
ted it would make the refledting ihudder.
Something had been said of the tardy
nature of military operations with regular
troops, and it had been remarked, that an
expedition this year had not been effected.
He attributed this to the llowneis of the
recruiting service owing to the clamour
raised against the war by those opposed to
the present system. Besides, the govern
ment had been blamed for not (hewing pa
cific dispositions towards the Indians and
had withheld the war, to procure peace by
treaty, a vain hope.âBut several attempts
had been made on our part to procure
peace. The fate of Harding, and others,
were melancholly evidences of this truth :
But the certainty was, as it appcarad to
him, that the Indians must be forced to
make peace, they would not be quiet of
choice.
A gentleman from Virginia hadobjefted
to a refpeÂ£lable military eftablilhment, be
cause it would produce an increase of mi
litary among the BritiOi and Spaniards to
the north and south of us. This was no
reason with him, why the United States
(hould not make themselves refpc&able in
theeyefofthe Indians.
Some years since, they told us of their
[ confederacy, and to think of no separate
treatiesâto keep on our fide of the Ohio.
We now flatter ourselves with peace, be*
cause they have told us they will treatâbut
in what language, and by whom diÂ£lated,
I am forbid totrlf, the doors were closed
when we received it.
The fame gentleman had also mention
ed those enlifling in our service as worth
ies charaÂ£lers ; the sweepings of the
ftrcets, Scc. They appeared to him as
refpe&able, he said, as the generality of
those who turned out in the American
war.
He made some fifther observations on
! the comparative excellence of regulars and
militia, and brought some further infta:ices
into view in support of his opinion.
Abuses, it had been intimated, had
crept into our army ; no army could be
totally free from abuses, he observed, and
he gave it as his opinion, that the army of
the United States was as free from them
as mod, especially when its distance from
the feat of givernment was confidcred.
He concluded by a recapitulation of the
sentiments he had exprefied, and which
should influence him to vote against the
motion. Especially as the system had
been adopted after mature consideration.
To change it now would argue that when
it was firll adopted, it was done with unbe
coming bafie, or (hew a great inflabllity.
The Indians would laugh at us as ihconfift.
rrit, and might be induced to give us the
epithet of petticoat men, and no longer coat
men.
In some part of his argument, he ex-
I prefled it, as his opinion that notwithr
j '.landing appearances to the contrary, we
should not have peace very soon.
To be continued.
