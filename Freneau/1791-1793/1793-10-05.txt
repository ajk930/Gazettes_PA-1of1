" I have not met with a (ingle person a
mong those denominated anti-federalifts by
American aristocrats, title Imnters, & mo
narchy-men, who has expressed a wilh that
the United States (hould take any part in
the present European w.irs, or be involved
in their politics. This pretext of abnfe is
nevertheless continually made use of by
wealthy paper jobbers, and their tools, in
order to depreciate the republicans of this
country, and reprefeiit them as patrons oi
anarchy. The war, however, that the high
federanfts have so mm ii deprecated will
certainly come upon them, and a little of
their ill gotten hoard mull be parted with.
The weltern countrv miift either be given
:ip or defended. The late determination
at the treaty, certainly involves us in a Bri
ti(h and Indian war (as 1 am informed
from Canada) unless the Ohio is mads tile
fixed boundary."

" It is impossible that the Americans cat
much longer submit to the insults of th<
English on their trade. Every port in thi:
part of the kingdom swarms with Ameri
can vefl'els, taken and brought in by Britilli
rniiferj. 1 have attended several trials at
DaCtors Conlmons 4 where I have been
ihocked to fee the unaccountable conduct
of both captors and judges." Bribes are
frequently offered, from 5001. to 10061. to
the captains and mates of the prizes, Jo
f\vear against their fliips ; and, lorry Jam
<0 fayj some of them have received the
bribes, and on others the bribes have been
proved, and the vefiels (till detained. No
American veifel is allowed to pass to France
â with any cargo, except Tobdcto, nor is ad
mitted from thence but in ballall. From
what I fee of the wretched ftute of this
country, the Americans have the means of
redress in their own hands, and by acting
with a proper degree of spirit a war may
be prevented. But if the Americans remain
quiet, there is no doubt but this country will
offer Itill greater insults, and they will at
lift be under the rteceltity of taKingup arms.
The best plan for tlie p.-efent, would be to
come into a non-importation agreement
of every article manufactured in Bri
tain. The English and Scotch manufacto
ries (already in the lalt ltage of distress)
would then be wholly at a Hand, and the
many thousands that now fublift by the
American trade, would be reduced to the
greatest extremities. Manchester has at
this time upwards of twenty thousand of
their workpeople maintained by fubferip
tion ; and every manufacturing town in
the country is in the f;ime deplorable con
dition. One cloth manufactory discharged
twelve hundred workmen in one day.â
The other day in Leeds market, upwards
of 10,000 pieces of cloth were put up for
sale, and not 30 fold. Should the United
States (top the trade with Britain, there is
no doubt but the inhabitants would instant
ly refufe any further fubmillion to the folly
of their tyrannic rulers, and would compel
the minister to change his conduCt towards
the Americans. Thus would a war be pre
vented, which mud otherwise soon involve
both countries in ruin."
[From a CorreJpondcnt.~\
To the public:âlt has been remarked by
several citizens that a great number of
lioufes in this city have been doled during
the present contagious and baneful fever,
whereby the air confined in them has be
come stagnant, which is well known to aÂ£t
injuriously to the health of the body. Pure
air is abfelutely neceflary to wholefomere
fpiration, in which the country abounds
where those now are whose houses are clos
ed. I would therefore recommend to
tfcetn, if they have the welfare of their
fellow citizens in Philadelphia at heart,
that they would exert their endeavours,
by some means or other to have their
lioufes daily well aired, whereby many
lives might be f.ived ; for if this precauti
on be not attended to, it certainly will be
followed with fatal confluences. The)
might confide the care of their houses tc
some trusty persons of their acquaintance,
who are yet remaining in the city, during
their absence, for the purpose of airin{
the apartments, whereby the otherwise
probable fatality may be prevented."

patch persons to the hospital in thÂ« earliefl

has probably been the cause of many deaths
which by a more early attention niighl

it then got to the southward and seemed ti
blow with redoubled force ; the (liip wa:
kept before the wind as well as it was pos
sible to do, but became quite unmanageable
111 consequence of the quantity of watfi
with which her decks were always loaded.
About 12 o'clock on Tuesday land Wasdif.
covered right a head and not a quarter of s
mile off, it was not pollible to guide the
Ihip any way so as to (teer clear of it, and
equally to difcovcr if any landing could be
attempted, tho' as a lall resource, Capt.
Ducket ordered the fpritfail to be set, but
it was blown away in 5 minures. In this
extremity, without an alternative, the Ihip
llruckfeveral times, &at laftherdecks fell
in : every one now began to think of saving
himfelf if possible, tho' no one knew or had
any conception of what could be done to
effect it; some jumped overboard, others re
mained with the wreck, all were equally
uncertain of their fate. About 2 oclock,
P. M. ten of the (hip's crew, and among
them Thomas Hawkins, chief mate, found
ihemfelves alive upon land, but not one
could give an account how he got alhorfe,
as the rocks over which they clartibeivd or
were thrown by the fei, were amazingly
high, and inaccessible in ati ordinary time;
the few who were saved were much
bruised.
Of 42 negroes which Capt. Ducket had
brought with him, 13 only were found
alive, and one of them died the next day.
So little of the wreck appeared, that, but
forthefe melancholy circumfiances, itcould
not have been believed that such an acci
dent had happened ; the land proved to be
the foutli fide of" Norman's Iflind (one oi
the Virgin Islands). At a moment before
the mate quitted the fbip he stood hand in
hand by the lide of Capt. Ducket, whose
lalt word was, Hawkins save yourfelf, and
in the ieap he made to difengaje himfelf
Irom the wreck, he fnppofed Capt. Ducket
(till by his fide, till, to his infinite grief, he
found to the contrary, and that his captain
whom lie loved, and whose life was dear
to him as his own, was ;iot to be fonnd,
i>r his body distinguished, the n?xt day,
from the carcases of 30 of his comrades,
who had fallen victims 011 this melancholy
Jccafion.

It is generally supposed that Gafton, who
heads the loyalists 111 Brittany, is an aristo
crat, and a friend to the ancient monarchy.
âThe fait is quite otherwise. Gafton is a
friend to freedom fectiredby a limited mo
narchy. He is so fat- from entertaining
principles of despotism, that lie aitfiS to
Hand on popular ground, and reft'fes to
admit the old nobility into his army. Should
Gafton prevail, the confederated nionarchs,
would nÂ«t have great matter >f felicita

m;giftratp, under some other name, bul
he would only be the mod honoured servant
ot the public ; the fnpreme authority
would remain with the People.
There seems to be a conffderable degree
of resemblance between the chararter and
situation of Gafton, and thatof the renown
ed Scottiih hero, Wallace, who led on a
party of his countrymen in the paths of true
liberty and glory, 111 spite of the king of
England on the one hand, and a combina

THE National Convention is informed,

Such attempts of modern aristocracy were
jnknown to the ancients. If the power
Jt printing was wanting to them they
were at least ignorant of its rtimes. They
.ommitted llieir laws only to incorruptible
Srals, or to the pure remembrance of
children : and they did not behold them
slatted 111 their infancy bv that invention
which ought to consecrate and diffufe
them.
It Utherefore anew obligation imposed
an the legislator, to watch over, and as one
may fay, to follow his own work, until it
arrive in full purity at the most diftanc
cottage. It is also a new duty for a revo
lutionary people, who, by the nobJeft
means, are approaching the term of their
regeneration, to guard, with the utmolt
vigilance, against thole base calumniators
ot the conftitutioHal monumentâthole IW
cret enemies 01 the nation, why wifti to
annihilate all its rights, and to blast even
its hopes, by breaking the anchor which
the legislators have throwri aniidft the
Itorni.
Among the Athenians the haw inflicted

he ulurpfttf the sovereignty. Among the
French, become free, let him who fhaU
introduce himlelf into the thoughts of the
legislators, 10 misrepresent the result of
them, fall under the sword of the law.
I he National Convention invites all the
friends of liberty to search out with dili
gence these fabricators offalfe laws. It
recofhmeiulsto all citizens nnt to pass fen
tcnce, not to express their will, but on au

defeat those manoeuvres. Every grand
epoth of the revolution has always excited
one crimfc more of aristocracy and royal
ifm. We had reafbri to espktf, that all
their crimes and efforts would be united at
the moment when the constitution was a
bout to appear : but these efforts them
selves will eiifure to Joti the success of {f
work, which thev would have altered,
had it been hurtful to the people ; and in<-
favonrahle to their rights. These impo

republican constitution, as calumny has

ON SEEING A SCULL.
preacher, fiknt yet severe,
X Proclaims mortality to man ;
Thou, like this emblem (halt appear,
When time has meafur'd out thy span.
Here once was fix'd the dimpled cheek,
And from this fallow naked crown,
The curling honours, long anil sleek,
Fell light and negligently down.
This part once fortify'd the brain,
The feat of sense in ages fled ;
From whence might flow the raptur'd
(train,
<Or truths, bv {acred science bred.
Here hung the lips that once cou'd smile,
And here Werelix'd the orbs of light;â
Extingilifh'd now, corrupt and vile,
Suffus'd io everlafling night.
Behold ! the locket's empty space
Affrights the yet perceiving eye ;
And spreads pale horror o'er tile face
Of all that live, alas ! to die.
Here yet remain, efcpos'd and bare,
By dull delH'd, of earthy hue,
Those teeth that age vouchfaf'd to fparc.
A ufelexs and a moulJ'ring few !
Gay friend, here hung the lift'ning ear,
That fed the foul with sense, by found :
Her-; the loquacious tongue, aiid here
The noff, on this diilorted wound.
TJiefe all had convsrfe with the foul,
Myllerious work of heav'nly flcill;
Clay join'd to spirit form'd the whole,
And quicken'd dull; obey'd the will.
God call'd the life he lent away,
The dull return'd from whence it came ;
The spirit left the ftifl'ning clay,
And death difl'olv'd the vvotid'ious
frame.
Be witty, mortal, bold and free,
Yet own thy knowledge centers here ;
Ere long thy foalp, like this, (hall be,
Not worth the fordid fcxton's care.
Phis one, perhaps, a statesman's fchemej
Of guilty wealth and power contain'd :
V/herc now are ail his flattering dreams?
And wkof'. the mighty sums he gain'd ?
Perhaps forne former Garricl bore
This scalp aloft with graceful pride,
Ales ! his action charms no more, â¢
That once new force to wit fupply'd.
Perhaps, with cunning quibbles filld,
'Twas once a lawyer'sâarch and dry :
To obviate every claim, tho' fkill'd,
He paid one debt, decreed to die.
Perhaps some haughty Beauty's charms
Adorn'd this bone with white Sc red; â
No more the nymph the world alarms,
The lillies and the roses fled'.
Perhaps a crown these te*mple3 bound.
Before it subject nations bow'd ;
Now undiltinguifh'd, in the ground,
The beggar tramplis on the proud.
What cause.has mortal fiefh to boalt
Of tranfi "nc knowledge, wcauh and

The summons comes, our breath is loft,
And all is nothing in an hour.
All, all mult pais this dreary road
To dull and lilence, cold and gloom ;
All red in one ohture abode.
The dwelling of the world, a totnb.
O Thou wiiofe gift is life ! beilow

And lead me thro' this vale of woe,
The llalF of the guide of youth ;

great degree of iilfenfibiltty in matters of
religion that has prevailed in all ranks cl
men amongit us, notwithflanding the many
great judgments and deliveraiues, which,
as a nation, we have heretofore experi
enced ; she prevalence of infidelity, and
the negleit and opposition di covered by
many with regard to the inltitutions of
chriltianity, and the mediation of our Lord
and Saviour Jesus Christ takingalfo into
view, the alarming and increasing, judg
ments 'of' Gud that are abroad in the eartli,
the convulsions that have taken place in'
Europe, and the probability that our guilty
country nlay be involved in similar calami -
tie*; unanimously agreed, in appointing

The Synod molt earneiUy ex.iort and en
join upon per foils of ail ranks in our com

bulinefs, and unite in humble and eanieft
fupplicatiuns to the throne of grace, thro'
our divine Mediator, that God would im

the affairs of men and nations, and of their
obligations to him as their beneficent Pre

and \yhofe are all their ways; that he would
inspire our rulers and magidrates ot all
ranks with 3 sacred and pointed regard to
his providence and approbation, and fucli
wisdom to discern, and such resolution to
pursue, the measures that conduce to the
public interest at this critical period, as

Y.xtrafl of a letter from Holland, dated Aug. zo.
" Notwithstanding what may be supposed the
ardent desire of the Emptefs of Rulfia, it
not appear that under her auspices the Rufliai:
armies will ever becjmc conquerors of Conlhin
tinople, as threaten-d. On the contrary, then
is every profpecft of a speedÂ« peace tat in/> place
between the Aulirians, Ruliians,and Ottomans.
The hopes of a counterrevolution in France art
more and moreon thedecline, and although thi
King of Sardinia is making immense waiMkr
preparations in favour of supporting the atifto
cratic exiles from France, and restoring the cK
despotic government, the Emperor of German;
has declined giving them any effe&ual afiiftance,
It may reasonably be concluded therefore, tha
the powers of Europe will either not intermeddli
at all in the affairs of France, or if they do
It will be by a negociation rather than by violen
measures."
Jt having been fuggefttd to the Editor oj

THIS age is so fertile of mighty events
That people complain, with some reason
no doubt j
Besides the time loft, and besides the expence,
With reading the papers they're fairly worn out:
The paji is no longer an object of care,
The prejent consumes all the time they car

With his pence and his paper unwiiling to part,
