Report of the Secretary ofthe Treasury, re
lative to the Loans negotiated under the
AUs of the <\th and \ 2th of AuguJl T .1790.
[Continued from our I ast âand concluded, j
r T~ I O the foregoing representation, it may
X fecm an objection that the purchases
to the end of 1791, appear to have been
carried to the account 01 the surplus at the
end of 1790.
The ult:mate form which it has been
judged convenient to give to the tranfaca
-011 in the accounts ofthe Treasury, tan
not change what was truly the course of
fadts. The proceeds of the above menti
oned surplus and of theforeignloansfoim
ed together the fund for purchases. In tilt
accounts of treasury, the tiling was fuf-
of various modi(k>-tio.>,> at pL-a

monies ilfued for purchases might have
been legally carried to either of them.
It was judged mod advifea'.iie, in the
forms of the treasury, to place the pur
chases to the end of 1791, to the account oj
the domestic fund, because it was calcula
ted to give greater latitude and energy tc
the finking fund. Had not this cour.'e beer
pmTued, the bulinefs would have taken the
following shapeâthe foreign fund to th(
extent of the purchases, would have beer

into the treasury should yield a correspond
ent surplus beyond the actual dijbtirje
mentsâwhich could not have been the c fe
while the war with the Indians continue:
to call for extraordinary expenditures.
From, the form into which the thing ha*
been thrown, the foreign fund has been fel
frre to be applied to in. pnrctrafifs ;
and a necessity produced of anticipating
the qutftanding duties, by temporary loans
for the- current service.
I trust there can be no doubt, that the
course pursued was regular, and within the
discretion of the department. I hope al
so, that it will appear to the hotife to have
been the mall eligible The expediency oi
giving the earliest and greatest pofiible ex
tent and activity to whatever concerns the
finking fund, will, it is prefunied, unite all
opinions.
What has been said hitherto refpecling
the employment of the foreign fundsis ap
plicable only to that part of it which \va.
drawnfor prior to April 1792 ; the residue
ft.-mding in a different situation and requir
ing a separate examination.
From the statement which has been giv
en, it may be perceived that the fund ir
quertion has neither been idle nor useless.
A confirmation of this will be found in the
following detaila.
The whole sum successively received or
account of Amsterdam bills up to the 17th
of August 1791, was 361,391 dollars anc
34 cents. The amount of the ,ies in
verted in purchases prior to mat clay wa:
350,000 dollars, chiefly by anticipation oi
those receipts.
The whole sum successively received or
account of Amsterdam bills from Augufl
17, 1791, to March t, f92, was 408,722
dollars and 69 cents. The amount of the
monies inverted in purchases between those
periods, was 349,984 dollarsand 23 cents,
chiefly in the month of September, and by
anticipation of those receipts.
The whole sum successively received or
account of Ainfterdam bills, subsequent ti
the Ift of March, and prior to July, 1792.
was 235,412 dollars and 33 cents. The
amount of themonies inverted in purchas
es between those periods, was 242,688 dol
lars and 31 cents.
It was stated in my firft letter, thai
177,998 dollars and I- o cents, of the pro
ceeds of the foreign bills were left in de
posit with the bank of North America ;
and in a note upon fUtement B accompa
nying that letter, the occasion of it wa:
{hewn to be an advance without interelt
made by that bank, for the ufeof the de
partment of war ; which could not yet b<

It ha# beei said, that actiftiiiQ ex.irain
atio i woiild beproper wsth regard to tile
â¡ills w/hieh have been dra%vn upon the so
reign fund, subsequent tp March, 1792. I
proceed now to this examination.
Tile expediency of what has been, in
this refpeit, done, seems to have been cal
led in question, under a fuggeflion that an
application oi the fund to purchases had
ceased to be advantageous
-1 he drawing of these bills has been ai
.'liferent periods influenced by various cor>-
iderations. A leading motive was alway;
-lie purchase ot the debt. And a correal
ww of the fubjeft will, I doubt not. satis-
J the Houle, that the measure was re
commended by an adequate profpett ol
advantage.
It is to be observed that all these draft;
were predicated uponthetwofour per cent
loana ; being as already stated real 4 i-e
aer cent loans.
There was good ground to presume, that
opportunities would be found of inveftinj;
he monies drawn for 1 1 purchases which
ivould yield at leal! 5 per cent, with a pof
Sbility of doing, hili better. The clittcr..

That this was the vieu of the fubjVit
which governed, is dtdutib'e not o;:!v
from the circumstances of the faÂ£l, biii
from my letter of the 2d of /pril, 179;
so Mr. Short, announcing my intention to
draw, in which I ajlign as the ground of
â  hat intention, " rhut I cojifidered it fdr
the interest of the United States to profei
:ute purchases of the publk debt with mo
nies borrowed o 1 the terms or the la/ft
loan," meanirg the loan of the ift of a
nuary 1792, at 4 per cent.
If the event be taken as a criterion, tfie
anticipation will be more than j'uftificd, the
prcfeut offering-an opportur.i tv
ior purchases peculiarly advantageous.
But without in'iftinor on a state of things
occaiiuntd by extraordinary circumstances.
it was morally certain, that the common
course of events would render the opera
tion a benefitial one. And it would not
a-gue peculiar forelighr. if a calculation
wa- even made on the effect. which thefi-
and probable progress of affairs in
"rope might produce upon our market.

Minutes of the Enquiry into the official
conduit of the Secretary of theTreafu
ry on several of the Resolutions moved
by Mr. Giles.âThursday, Feb. 2S.â
1 he House in committee of the whole,
Mr. Muhlenberg in the chair.
Mr. Giles, the original mover of the.
resolutions, rose. He was feniible, hefaid,
that he itood in a peculiarly delic ite situ
ation, in which nothing short of the public
good could have induced him to place him
ielf. It a public and highly refponiible
officer h-d violated the laws. it was necef-_
Pary that he ftiould be called to an account
for it : and to determine whether in the
instances before the ho 11 ft he had been
juilty of that violation, it is necefl'ary to
compare the teltimony with the facts al
ledgeclin the .resolutions before the com
nittee. He firll adverted to the law au
ihoriling the Prelident of the United States
:o borrow 12 millions of dollars for the
jurpofe of paying the foreign debt. On
this he remarked, that the authority of'
borrowing was expressly given to the I're
ident, no doubt with an eye to the peifon
il virtues of the character who fi.ls that
office ; the loan is also directed tobemade,
olely for the purpose of paying the public
Here he remarked, that in every
appropriation law, the appropriation is al
ways emphatically mentioned, which is art
;vidence that the legillature intend to re
uain the sole judges of the applications of
rtoney. He read a letter from the re
arv of the Treasury, who was employed
>y the Prelident to negociate this loan, to
Wr. Short, the Secretary's foreign agent
or this purpose, dated the 9th of May 179 1,
n which the Secretary informs Mr. Short,
:hat one million and a half of the money
tie had obtained on loan was destined for
Prance; of which sum he was authorised
:o apply immediately one million, but to
'eferve Bco,ooo florins to answer subse
quent directions, he fhquld receive from
the Treasury. He cited this paflage to
hew that the million and a half which hud
been obtained on loan, was destined Icr
France.
To remove any doubt that might remain
upon this head, he referred to a preceding
letter from the Secretary to Mr. Short,
dated the 13th of April, in which it is al
io expressly said, that of the two millions
borrowed, one miitipn and a half is intend
ed for France, the remaining hall' million
to wait for further direction*. Having
established tiiis point, fie adverted to the
refohition before the committee, which
fays, that he applied a portion of the prin
cipal borrowed to the payment of the in
terest frilling due upon thatprinsipal, with
out being authorized so to do by any law.
To fliew this he referred to a report of the
3d or January, containing fisndry frate-,
ments refpeftingForeign loans. That pare
of the report to which he alluded in proof"
of the fact, stated in general tei 111s, a Aim
paid on account ot foreign loans, and thiÂ»
'ufn was taken from the principal borrow
ed, ancl amounted to i-,fe33,jÂ£9 li<;iins.
this statement was accurate, the'fact l e
wiflied to eftablifli was, he Paid, prpved.
He wanted more light, however, he con
/efled, than he could cnlleÂ£t from theSeci e
| farj's ofitial contrcimicctfons. He C,sulci
j rot go into the examination -of what cir
-1 08-l'snses might .have induced the Cccr^..tury to deviate from the positive inj'ure
tio .5 of the law, or to make any remarks
upon nis conduit until he had heard what
gentlemen would lay to controvert the
lacr .ie wilhed to eftabtittt.
Another fact of coni'equence he wilhed
to prove, viz. that part of the money ob
tained on loan in Lurope had been drawn
over tho' not wanted here lor any pubiK
purpose j this appeared, he said, from other
papers. He turned to the inftruttionsfrom
the Prefideiit to the Secretary ot the Trea
sury, authorizing inm to borrow i4,ooo,ccc
us dolls. in wnii.li the secretary is caution
ed to keep in view the two several ast:
authorizing the loans, and the diltinci
condi ions theycontemplate. By the in-
It'riKtiOiis of the Prelident the Secretary is
authorized to apply the monies. In the
execution of the trull coniided to him, tin.
Prelident generally directs him to employ
Mr. Short to negociate the loans, to bor
row in the manner prescribed by the acts,
and to difeharge immediately the arrears ol
intere.t due t > the French, to which pu -
pole and to the complete payment of thai
debt the 12 million loan was altogether ap
propriated. If this money, then, wa.
Ihewn to have been drawn here, it was
neither warranted by law nor by theÂ»Preii
dent's instructions. The Secretary did be
gin to draw as early as 1790, and had con
tinued to draw from time to time, til)
j 793, without giving notice of this to the
Legislature. Having Ihewn that the Se
cretary had drawn without authority tu
draw, he next proceeded to coclider the
purpose of those drafts.
The money thus drawn for was not, he
Hated, applied to the purchase ot the pub
lic debt, no monfcy obtained from foreigr
loans was thus applied until this year, the
domestic refotirccs appropriated to this ob
ject were exh lulled. These were
the facts involved in the firft resolution,
whuff he wilhed to eftablilh ; beiore he
proceeded further in the difcufiion, he
wlh .1 to hear what gentlemen had to fay
to controvert them. He wilhed to fee jus
tice done in the bulineC. before the house
he v. -{hed juftiec, also, to be tempered w tl
modera.ion and mercy, and if gentlemei
could Ihew a neceliity for the deviation:
from positive law which he had endeavour
ed to printout, it would exonerate the Se
tretary from a very great (hare of blame."
Mr. Barnwell called for the reading 01
certain parts of the two acts authorilinj
the loans. One, of the 4th of August, au
thorizes a loan of 12.000,000 to be obtain
ed without limitation as to the interest, foi
the pu-pole of paying the foreign debt, the
other is of the 12th of Aug tÂ«r 2,000.000 ;
the interelt to be not more than 5 per cent,
and for the purpose of reducing the do
mestic debt.
Mr. Sedgwick, to disprove that the
drafts alluded to had been made without
the knowledge of the hgifliture, called 101
the reading of the Prelident's (peeihtc
both houses oil the Bth of December 1:90.
and a fubequent report of the Secretary ol
the Treasury to the fame point. By thii
it appeared that the power of borrowing
liavi ig been exerciied under the joint au
' thorny ot the two acts, the Secretary
(lates a difficulty that trad occurred to him
on the subject of the drafts alluded to. â
The money hiving been obtained 011 an in
terest of five percent- exclulive ot dou
ceurs, he wilhed the legislature to deter
mine whethei it might Unctly be conlider
ed as borrowed under the second act, \vhich
limited the interest at 5 per cent This
was lufficient, he conceived, to Ihew, that
the legillature were not ignorant of those
drafts, and ail ast was palled solving the
Secretary's doubt, and fa.iftioning his con
ftructiou of the law.
Mr. Giles remarked, fhat he had drawn
before that fanftion as obtained.
Mr. Fitzlimons observed 011 the firft
charge in the resolution, that as the inter
est of the money borrowed in t urope is
pay ible where borrowed, it was oecono
lmcal in the Secretary to pay that interest
with monies there, which were to be
drawn here, and replace the sum by ta
king the amount from the funds here def
tin.d for that payment. A financial ope
ration of this nature is limple, and saves
the trouble of drawing with one hand and
remitting with the other- He conceived
there was 110 just foundation for the lirrt
charge'.
Mr. Lawrence said that when the reso
lutions calling for information from the
treasury department were firft brought
forward, the public mind was imprelfed
with an idea, that there were monies un
accounted for ; this charge is now dropt.
and it is honorable to the officer concerned
that after much probing nothing is found
to support it. The enquiry now is, whe
ther a debt was paid out of this or that
fund. He did not admit the fact, that it
was paid out of any other monies, than
what law ftriftly warranted- He went
into a hiltory of the bulinefs from its ori
gin. He llated the nature and purposes
of the loans. There was nothing to pi e
vent the Prcfident, lie said, to consolidate
the two loans, provided such an arrange
ment did not interfere with the purpol'es
intended by them. The Prelident employ
fid the Secretarp to obtain the loans under
the joint authority of both acts, as it was
found that the object could bell be carried
into eifeft by such a;Â« arrangement. The
money thus borrowed, became ftibjeft to
the appropriations of both acts, and not c
-11 ulively lor the payment of the foreign
debt- ' Then as part of that money was
lubjeft to be drawn here lor the redemp
tion of the donieltic debt,. and the intes ell
of the loan was to be paid with doineflic
funds, it was perfectly re. fonable to avoid
I urLber drafts and remittances, to pay the
debt there with money there, and replace
it litre with money already here. The
fa ft slated in the firft part ol the resolution
is by this plain Hate of the cafe substantial
ly refuted, and appears altogether unfoun
ded ; but if the fact is proved, what is im
plied ? No injury to the interests of the
community; the intention of the legisla
ture has been in every point fulfilled. Ii
the Secretary had acted differently, lie
would have been guilty ol an absurdity,
and to blame for iauilicing the public in-
U-rtft, and neglecting the lpirit ot the law
tor a ftrid ?nd unprofitable observance ol
its dead letter.
Mr. Sedgwick by adverting to the fpeecl
of the Prelident and report ot the Secre
tary, had (hewn, that the ltgillature hati
been made acquainted with the drafts, anc
(auctioned future ones on the fame princi
ples. The latter part of the firft rcfolutioi
.riminates the Secretary for making then
without inltrucHons from the Prelident.
Kven if this was the cafe, he did not Know
whether this was really reprehenlible. Ht
defended it on this ground, that the Se
.retary i:; the officer appointed by law tc
uperinte d the finances and apply all mo
lies agreeably to appropriations. He took
i view of the bulinefs as slated by Mr.
Lawrence, and concluded by aiking, whe
:her if the Secretary w as found on a criti
cal examination to have deviated in a tri
fle from the letter of the law, Inch a devi
ation w. s fufficient to w arrant the alarm's
being founded from St. Lroix to St. Ma
ry's, and whether the precious time of the
tionfe, at the close of the fefiion, with a
variety of bufine s on their hands, u onld
be taken lip in so unprofitable and frivolou;
an inveftig ition.'
Mr. Giles said the transaction alluded tc
by the gentlemen to conti overt the fail
laid down in the firft part of the resolution
before the committee, was not so immate
rial as they had endeavourtd to shew it.
It wiis not merely a financial operation tc
avoid the necellity of drawing and remit
ting. The truth was, that theSecietu-y
had drawn over near 3,000,000 of dollars.
The President's authority was limited to
2,000,000.'
Mr. Lawrence was of opinion, that if
the Prelident, or his agent, had drawn the
whole amount of the money obtained un
der both loans, he could not be said to
have gone beyond his authority. He was
authorized to borrow 12,cc0.000 to pay
the arrears on the foreign debt, and to
modify the whole. In the execution of
this trult he might have found it advifea
b!e to draw to the country the whole of
that sum. It had been found advifeuble to
draw for part, and to pay the French by
(hipping produc eto St. Domingo. If the
money expended for supplies to St. Do
mingo is deducted, the balance will be
found less than 2.000,000.
The committee reported progress, and
obtained leave to fit to morrow.

IN ftjpport of the doctrine, that public

and rui nous, it may be also proper to quof
the opinion of Mr. Hume ; this celebrated
hiflorian, when treating on public credit,

ties of war, and to hoard up treasures be

coiqueft or defence; without trusting to
extraordinary impolitions, much less to
borrowing i times of difbrder and confu
lion. The wiser Emperors of Rome, Au
s;ufhis, Tiberius, Vespasian, Severus, &c.
always discovered the prudent forefight of
laving great funis against any public exi
gency.
On the contrary, our modern expedient,
which has become very general, is to
mortgage the public revenues, and to trult
that poflerity will pay off the incumbran
ces contracted by their ancestors : and
they having before their eyes so good an
example of their -wije fathers, have the
lame prudent reliance on their poflerity i
who at last, from neceflity more than
choice, are obliged to place the fame confi
dence in a new posterity. But not to
wafle time in declaiming against a pra&ice
which appears ruinous beyond all contro
rjerJ'y, it seems pretty apparent that the an
cient maxims are, in this refpeÂ£t, more
prudent than the modern ; even though
the latter had been confined within some
reasonable bounds, and had ever in any
inflance, been attended wrth filch frugali
ty in time of peace, as to discharge the
debts incurred by an expensive war.
If the abuses of treasures be dangerous
either by engaging the flute in rafli enter
prizes, or making it negleit military dijeti
plins in confidence of its riches; tife a
buses of mortgaging are more cerjuin at Â«
inevitable; poverty, impotence, and fub
jetiior to foreign powers.
It is vei y tempting to a minister so em
ploy Cu'-li an expedient, as enables him
10 make a great figure during his admini
stration, without ov erburthemng the peo
ple with taxes, or exciting any immediate
clamours againfl himfelf. The practice.
therefore, of contrasting debt wil: almoil
infallibly be abused, in every government.
It would scarcely be more, imprudent tf
give a prodigal Ton a credit in every ban
ker's (hop in London, than to empower s
llatefman to draw bills in this manner up
on pojlerity.
W hat then (hall we fay to the new para
dox that public incumbrances are ot them
selves advantageous, independent ot tht
necessity of contra&ing them;, and that anj
(late, even though it were not prelled by i
foreign enemy, could no: pollibly liavt
embraced a wiler expedient tor promo
ting commerce and riches, than to creat<
funds, and and taxes without limi
tation ? Reafoiiings, such as these, mighi
naturally have paifed tor trials ot wit a
mong rhetoricians, had we not seen fuel
abjurd maxims patronized by great mini-
Hers, and by a whole party among us.
Let us examine the consequences o:
public debts, both in our domellic manage
ment, by their influence on commerce anc
mdultry ; and in our foreign tranfaÂ£tions
by their ettect on wars and negotiations.
In oppolition to the favorable circum-
Vances, perhaps of no very great impor
:ance, eigh the many disadvantages wnicl
attend our public debts, in the whole in
terior oeconomy of the ltate . you wil
ind no comparison between the ill and tht
jood which refultsfrom them.
First. It is certain that national debt
:aufe a mighty confluence of people anc
iches to the capital, by the great funis le
vied in the provinces to pay the interest o:
these debts.
Secondly. Public flocks, being a Kind o;
3 aper-credit, have all the difadvantagei
attending that species of money. The;
banilh gold and lilver irom the mod conli-
Jer ble commerce of the ltace, reduce
them to common circulation, and by thai
means render all provilioiis a d iaboui
dearer than otherwise they would be.â
Thirdly, ihe taxes which are levied tc
p y tile interests of the debts, are apt enhei
[o heighten the price of labour, or to lÂ»t
311 opprellion 011 the poorer fort.
Fourthly. As foreigners pofl'efs a greai
(hare of our national funds, they rendei
:he public in a man ier tributary to them
and mny in time occalion the transport o;
aur people and our indullry.
Fifthly. The greatelt part of public
flock being always in the hands of idle peo
ple, who live 011 their revenue, our fund:
jWe great encouragement to an useless anc
naftive life.
But though the injury that arises tc
-.ommerct -and ii.diijiry from our publh
c untU will appear, upon ballancing tht
whole, not inconsiderable, it is trivial ii
:omparifon of the prejudice that result:
:o the (late co ifidered as a body politic,
which mull support itfelf in the society ol
lations, and have various tranfaÂ£tions with
other Hates in wars and negociations. Tht
HI there is pure and unmixed, without anj
favourable circuinltance to atone for it
and it is an ill, too, of a nature the higheil
and molt important. Mr. Hume aftei
making further remarks on the deflruc
:ive consequences of public credit, observe:
:hat the nation inuft dellroy the public
:redit of Great-Britain, or public credii
will destroy the nation. It is impoflible
:hey can both subsist, after the manner the)
lave been hitherto managed in that, a:
well as in some other countries.*
France under the old government, pur
lued the ruinous system of mortgaging it>
-evenues- This fyllem however, almoil
unaided by any other cause, has overturn
ed that government, by means of the moll
extraordinary revolution upon record. II

AN AMERICAN FARMER.
March 6th, 1793-
â¢(â¢ Young's travels in Franc:.
To the EDITOR of the NATIONAL
GAZETTE.
SIR,
TT is remarked by aprofound writer,that
1. " all societies throughout the varied
forms of democracy, ariitocracy., and mon
archy, verge more or less rapidly to des
potism, us ail rivers, whether their pailage
be thro' vallies, hills, or mountains, bend y
their course invariably tothefea.'' This
remark ought to be a serious memento to
the citizens of the United States ; and as
decay and death seem to be the lot of
every free government, temperance in the
body politic ihould demand the fame care
and attention, that the body natural re
quires, that the progress to the grave of
iiefpotifm may be impeded. As the period
i)f exigence very often depends upon ori
ginal stamina, and "we are yet in the infancy
of a government, too much attention can
lot be bestowed to give that vigour of po
litical fibre which will alone insure us a
free, a nervous, and a comfortable age.â
Children who are taught to admire frip
pery, and have their minds furniftied v ith
the vanities of this life, have a cast given to
their actions which oftinies haunts them to
their end ; ill like manner, when follies are
engrafted upon a government that has just
emerged into being, they not only enervate
it in embryo, and make it the perpetual
jbjeft of a nursery, and a phyiician, but
ihey hasten that dissolution which every
freeman ought to deploreâ and
forms have an influence upon the human
mind, for sb much are we the creatures of
imitation and of habit, that we afient to
things because others have done so; and
continue improper practices because it re
quires an effort to change them. " Even
uames," faysPaley, " are not indifferent."
When the multitude are to be dealt with,
here is a charm in foundsâlt was upon
this principle that several itatefmrnof those
times advised Cromwell to ailume the title
us King, together with the ancient style
and jnlignia of royalty. The juinds of
many, they contended, would be brought
to acquiesce in the authority of a king,
who fufpeftecl the office, and were offended
with the administration of a protestor..
Novelty reminded them of usurpationâ
The adversaries of this deiign opposed the
ineafure, from the fame perfusion of the.
ejjicacy of names and forms, jealous leji tke
veneration paid to theje, jnould add an in
fluence -which might er/Jnare the liberty of
the Commonwealth." The government of
the United States may be fa d to be iq its
infancy; it has just attained its fourth year,
and on it.. present treatment depends its
future charaflerâlf we are a republic, re
public ill manners, republican laws, and a
republican aclminiftration Ihould obtainâ
If we are not, oilier requisites would best
accord with our government. If names,
aciordingto Puley, are not indifferent, and
forms influence the mind, we cannot pro-
I'cribe every name and form too severely,
which have had their origin in monarchy,
an do not apply to the true character of a
republic. To what source can we trace
levees, drawing rooms, Jeparation from the
people, robes of office, ire'. Certainly not to
a republican one, for these are the veryop<
pofites of equalityâW hat will be the re
fijlt when the mind becomes accuitomed to
the regalia of a cpurt ? Is not the tranli
tion to monarchy more easy after the mind
is habituated to its names and forms ? Let
it not be said that t efe things are indiffer
ent ; for nothing is indifferent which can
sap the foundation upon which our equality
relts. An inattention to this, is an intem
perance which will hasten the period of
decay, and verify the remark with which
I began this essay. Republican laws are an
essential prop to republican existence ; but
is a law which fixes a perpetual debt upon
us, republican ? " Debt is the ready way
to poverty : a wife people, no more than a
wife man, will ever place their security in
a load of debts. He that is in debt, is loft,
loft to the society of which he is a member,
because they can receive no benefit or af
(iftance from him ; and loft to himfelf, beÂ»
cause he will be no longer trusted, and is
expufed by his neceflitous circumstances to
the caprice, contempt and power of bis en
mies, and too often to the ingratitude and
flight of those, who have lived upon himâ
It is much to be feared that a nation op
pre fj'ed with debt, -Mill but too much rejem'
ble the prodigal thild, who having
dered away his patrimony in luxury and
profujenejs, gives himfelf up to corruption
and venality. For, as national debts and
taxes enable one Jet of men to corrupt, Jo
they lay a multitude of others under the
temptation of bti'g corruptedâAnd it is
well known, that poverty and bad exam
ples will drive men to fell their dearelt
birthright" The opinion that "a public
debt is a public blefling," is of very modern
origin, and it a sophism pregnant with evil---That a public debt often becomes a pri
vate blelling ami a public curse, the history
of many miiiiflerial chara&ers will fuffi
ciently authenticate ; that it has dispensed
blessings to individuals in America cikmot
for a moment be doubted ; but that the
United States have been benefited by their
debt and the prefeivt fifcal arahgements, ii
a problem not likely to be solved in favour
of its author, uniefs by fpeculatort and
flock-jobbers. What have been the eitect
of union and an efficient government have
been ascribed to the administrators, altho'
the fame benefits would have flowed trom
it had the head of the treasury never ex
itedâDo the laws of the union, the re
fpeifability of the American charatter, the
commerce, manufactures, and agriculture
of our country, the individual honelly as
well as the public Integrity of every de
partment of our government depend upon
the administrator of the finances? It is
fiid that our credit has been established by
theadminiftration ; but will any one offer
such lfult to the United States as to fnp
pofe that their credit rested upon the nar
row flioulders of one man? Suppose the
funding system to have been diiterently
and that the original holders
Los the piper of the United States had been
indem-vfied, after the completion of the
organization, would not our credit have
been the fame ? Our credit depends upon
our national character, and not upon the
Imagined importance of any individual in
the union.âSuppose the old confederation
to have continued, what would have been
the credit of the United States, even had
the finances been in the administration of
its present officer? This is the quefticn,
for by contemplating it properly, we (hall
be able to decide, whether the credit of
the United States depended upon the new
ly acquired vigour ol government - , or upon
an cfluer acting under it. It is the falliion of
the day to ascribe every benefit which has
resulted from the energetic union of the
states, to the fthemes of the Secretary of
the Treasury ; as if, not only all the abil
ities, but all the virtues of the union had
their focus in him. Public credit is a de
lusive thing, it means a facility of borrow
ing. and liKe private credit lays the foun
dation of distress and bankruptcy. The
iituation of our country, removed at a dif
tr nee from every foe which can endanger
her independence, makei the fame expen
ces and provilions nnnecefTary, which Eu
ropean governments requireâWe have no
increase of military establishment to con
template, no naval armaments to antici
pate, no application of our monies for
court intrigue to expect ; a facility of bor
rowing therefore is not *oour go
vernment ; for as the expeucet of trcr ef
tablifhmenc can be calculated with tolera
ble cxattnefi, the sources of revenue can
be fixed and can be made commensurate to
the objefl. Public credit produces public
debt, public debt increased taxation, and
increased taxation poverty and oppression ;
the sooner therefore we relieve ourselves
from our debt by an honert discharge of it,
the sooner shall we efcapefrom the clutches
of that hydra, which has vomited forth
misery upon every country which unfortu
nately foftered it. The improper influ
ence which public debt gives to the head of
the treasury is dangerous to liberty we
have already seen the coloffial power of
this department ; we have seen it resorted
to on occasions, in which even the venal
parliament of Great-Britain maintains its
jealousy, the originating of money hills ;
â what are we to expert when age fliall have
ripened it, and fholl have added to it the
vigour of manhood ? It is a pivot now on
which a coiifiderable portion of our go
vernment turns, and is likely, if not check
ed. to become a centre towards which
even the United States will gravitate.

Explanation of the Report of the Commit
tee of the Senate, to whom the Subje3 o J
Weights and Measures was referred.
THE report of the committee is found
ed on the principle that a rod which vi
brates seconds in the latitude of forty-fivi
degrees is fifty-eight inches and sixty
eight hundredths of an inch in length ;
dividing a rod of that length into foui
hundred and eighty nine equal parts, oru
hundred of those parts will be equal tc
twelve of the above mentioned inches, 01
the foot now in use. In this way a roc
may be made a flandard, and if the mea
fures in use be 101 l or become uncertain, ii
may be always resorted to in any part o
the United States, by making due alow
ances according to tht difference oflati
tude.
The committee propose to m ke certaii
measures and weights now 111 use, the unit
of the measures and weights of the Un : tei
States, that the adoption of the fyllcn
may be the more easy to the community
as no difference will take place in the con
tents of the units It 'is also propofet
that the units fhou d be divided into cent
or hundredth parts ; this div fion woulc
make tie arithmetic necefTarv for the com
mon purpofei of life easy to every capacity
as the four simple rules woul.i be ftifficient
without the compound met os j and ai
the divisions of the units of the measure:
and weights would be the fame with thoft
of the u i' of the money of account, th<
fame species of arithmetical calcnlatioi
would take p ace, and the computation o
either would soon be easy and familiar
By the division of the units into cents, tin
denominations of the measures and weight!
would be few in number, and those fami
liar to our ideas, and the memory woulc:
be no longer burthened with the perplex
ing multiples and divisions of the present
measures and u eights.
In the n eafures of length, it is propofecl
that the foot, cnain,and mile should remain
the fame as those now in use. The divi
hon of the fooÂ». into cents, will be conve
rgent foi wotkmen, as Gunter's carpenter's
rule, vvÃich is generally used, is divided
into cents, as well as into inches ; so that
the relative proportion between them may
be eaftly ascertained. The chain is the
infttument generally used in meafuringdif
tiinces, and. is found from experience to he
the mod convenient length for a&ual mm
furation : it is four of the present rocs 01
poles, twenty-two yards, or sixty-six feet ;
and ten chains make one of the present
furlongs.
In the measure of land, the r.cre is pro
posed to be the fame as the present acre*,
and illmeaiuripg of land the chain is also
n! d ; it is already divided into han redth
parts, called links; chains and links mul
tiplied by chains and links give acres and
decimals of an acre, which has occasioned
the divilion of an acre into cents, to pre
vail already in some of the flaus, in pre
ference to roods and perches.
In measures of capacity, the bushel i;
proposed to be a cubic foot and a quarter,
or two thousand one hundred and iixtv
cubic inches, which is about a mean of the
several b ifhels now in use ; some of tht
llates having bushels containing near fifteer
cubic inches more, and others near as mr.cl
l'-fs, âit is the quantity proposed by tht
Secretary of State in his report on mea
sures and weights ; his idea is also adopt
ed of abolilhing the diftiu6tion betweer
wet and dry measures, of disregarding the
ale and w.ne gallons and o having only
one measure of capacity By dividing the
bushel into cents, an easy reference may
be made from the cents to the different
measures of capacity now in use: Fifty
ents will he equal to the h ilf bulhel, and
(wentv five cents to the peck.
In weights, the pound is proposed to be
:he fame as the Avoirdupois pound, and
he gram the fame as the Troy grain ;
by dividing the pound into cents, tht
:ents into tenths or mills, and the mill in
to seven grains, a series is formed whicl
;onnefts with exaftnefs the pound Ai'oir
[<upois with the grain 1 roy. In weigh
ing large quantities the Avoirdupois furies
is used ; in weighing valuable articles, as
j;old, lilver or diamonds, or small quanti
ses as medicines, the Troy series is used :
.he two series may therefore be connected
o as to make but one species of weight:
icccflary, without any inconvenience :
The weights for gold and silver, the iteel
j'ards, and the common iron weights, may
:ontinue to be used, and be adapted tu
lie new series.
