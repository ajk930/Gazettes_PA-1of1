X. A. PICHON, a French Citizen at Phi
ladelphia, to M. COTELLE.
S1 n,
A S it is more than probable that your let
ter-x- to Citizen Genet will remain
unanfwtred, I conceive it to be the duty
offnch French citizens ai are acquainted
with oil! Well India affairs, to point out
to the public the sycophantic intimations it
contains, and to warn American citizens to
pay as little attention to calumniators from
the Welt Indies as they have done to the
slanderous report* of the emigrants from
Europe. ' *
I am fcnfible, fir, that a full and tho
rough investigation of fails flioukl be sub
joined. to support such a preliminary in
junction, and this I have e-jcry means in my
power to do. At the fame time, lam al
together unwilling to call out of their
peaceful tomb of oblivion, the bloody pro
ceedings which for three years pait have
disgraced your country ; and it is with the
greatefl reluctance that I take a painfui
review oi those horrid scenes, some ol
which I hare been 311 eye- witness tu : in
deed, fir, I have been so unfortunate as tc
reside in your island, and in that very town
from whence you came. Thanks to the
obfeurity in which I lived,l was allowed to
look at the epidtrmocrafnal tyranny when
it was at its zenith. Yesâl have witnessed
the murdei-ous and doieful consequences
ot a fyflem nonsensical in the extreme.
Documents of these tranfaÂ£lioris are now
in my hands, anil poflibly the time may
coine when I shall let the world know that
our white people of the Well Indies have
out done the Spaniards in absurd and ridi
culous fyfterm, and arleall equalled them
3n baseness and ferocity.
You seem to affec) a very sincere cort
tfifn 101 llie natioital laws. which, you pre
tend, have been trampled upon by the na
tional civil coinmiffioners.âSir, your
Jneaninjt muA be, beyond all doubt, that
they enforced the execution of those laws
ajainfl which you have waged war these
three years past. Nobody but YOU (your
colour I mean) has been guilty of an in
fringement of those very la ivs you had sworn
to support. Nobody but you opposed the
Sovereignty of the people, and the DE
CREES of their reprefentativea.
It the na.;ie oi FRENCHMAN had become
fcurdenfome to you, if after an examinati
on of your principles and situation you had
discovered that a political regeneration
"would never suit men of your cafi; then a
fair and open conduct was to be preferred :
you ought to have declared to the world
that you never meant to have aiharein the
glorious toils of Franc*, and that the feaft oi
FREEDOM was a fpeciesof entertainment
illy adapted to your degenerate ftomarhs.
You ought not, however, to advocate
our laws and oppose them afterwards.
"Whenever a coiony becomes weary ofir>
mother country, it is no more than jufi
that they should /hake off its yoke, and, il
its independence is opposed, wa<re war a
gainst it. But you add insult to injury.
You called for a separate conflitution, arid
ia the meantime set yonrfelves up for re
formers of OUR OWN !
For three years part your conduct ha:
been little else than a series of unprinci
pled pride, unsettled schemes, and un
bounded ferocity .... You have entered
the field in defence of the bloody, but
childish prejudices of -our femalesâyoi,
have waged war against the'peÂ»pl e of co
lour [mulattiiesj with poignard, wheel,
and gallows, while beari'ng the Olive
Branch of Peace, they proffered you theii
prayers and intreaties !âYour manoeuvre:
have been conflamly in the dark, and th<
wound given under the veil of secrecy
CONVINCED, at length, of the abfurdit;
of your claims, you were flill too obsti
nate to part with them. No less than foui
different colours had been displayed ji
*yotir towns: internal divisions have giver
you up, hands and feet tied, to the citizen:
ot colour who, steady to the principle;
they set our upon, and flrongly encamped
on iuaffailable mcuntains, have putfued j
fixt and energetic line of conduit, fron
wliich neither success or calamity have pre
vailed onthein tc deviate.

invasion it was more than probable the
whites had a mind to facilitate in order to
crush fhofe citizens of colour whom, by
their own confeflion, they were always by
tnemfelves too weak to subdue. In fucii
circumflances was it not the true interelt
of the nation to secure in the island that
ciafs of Iteady citizens who would defend
it to death ; and to favour it rather than a
clafj of an other description, who, always
divided among themselves, could never
furnifh one fourth part of their number, as
men to be depended on. That part of the
white people who were patriots were al
ways floating between the interef't of the
country and that of their own pride. The
firft power that would have pledged itfelf
to re-inflate them in their unnatural rights
would have gained *hem over to their lide;
while the citizens of colour would nor have
liefirated between a revolution which allot
ted them their true place, and a counter
revolution by means of which, supposing it
to have be-en fuccefsful. they would have
been funk lower in political conlequence
than at any former period.
hrom what has 6t*en faicl it is not at all
surprizing to fee here certain Cockaded-
GentleMen from the French Weft In

on condition of their pride being spared :
and although they apparently submitted tc
the law s, Hill they had sworn in their hearts
and before the great god of their pride,
that when ever opportunity should offei

The reform of modes bf government are
bleff:;igs only in proportion as they promote
the liberty and happiness of the people. To
fatisfy the ambition of one class of men and
the avarice of another, the Americans have
Submitted to afecond revolution, by which
they have bjrtered their domedic right!,
liberty and equality, for energy of govern
ment and the etiquette of a court. After
having wreftea the feeptre from thehand of
a British tyrant, they have fuff'ered it to be
assumed by a monied aridocracy, where it
will be found more oppreflive and more in
jurious to the people. The excise law of
Congrefi, which viola*esthe domestic rights
of the farmer, and the incorporating decrees
of the Ita'e legislatures, by which the pro
perty of the farmer is wantonly f.icrificed
to a rich monied interest, are alarming ex
ertions of this power.
The more a nation is compact and the
power of government left in the hands of
the people, the more we (hall find that love
for the public good, that general edeem
for virtue, and that difuitereltednefs whicn
are held in light edimation by the fupport

To ihe People c/Tennsylvania.
TTAVING palled my time lately in the
Uack country, where I could not be
favoured with the current news of the day,
I have been prevented from either feeing
what has been written on the fubjeft of
Canals, Turnpikes, &c. or ofgiving my
opinions thereon.
My sentiments may, perhips, by Tome, '
be considered worthy of attention, by others
neglected ; however they may be received,
I think it my duty to defend, to the utmod
as my ability, every poor man, against the
lawless power of the rich, whose arbitrary
encroachments upon the jull privileges oif
man, are now alarming.
Several acts have palled rn this ar well as
in other Hates, which have a direst tenden
cy to annihilate that confidence which in
dividuals were wont to place in their re
presentatives.Some atls are pro tempore, &
according to their evil tendency will fooo
er or later be annulled or corrected. There
are other acts which do not seem so imme
diately toWffect, but their future agency is
more fatal.
Legislators are not merely elected to
preserve the exiding laws, to extend them,
to enaÂ£t others according to the original
spirit of the conflitution, but te guard the
publicrightsfrom trespass, as well as the
individual. How far the legillators of this
state have aSted confidently with their
milt we (hall examine.
It will be nefcelfary to premife-'-
ill. That the legislature has no power j
' to give away the public property.
2d. The legislature has no power to in-'
fringe private property without the plea ef
necejfity. and for the public good.â
These premises cannot be deniedâBut
the public property has been given by the
legislature to t private company (which is
the fame as to a private individual) in ma
ny instances, and particularly in the high
way to Lancaster. It belongs to the pub
lic, and in spite of all the sophistry of iaw
quibblers, cannot be ceded to individualsâ
This power has never been delegated to
the legislature, and to afliimeit is tyranni
cal!
It may be urged by those who desire ac
commodation at the expence of privilege,
that if the power of amending, and draw
ing a profit from, the high ways, were not
veiled in a private company, it would not
be executed at all. I do not grant this, for
as the Hate is free from debt, and capable
of placing i n anunneceffary bank(edabli(h
ed for mere oppofition&private accommo
dation )fo large a funi of money as they have
lately done, what difficulty would there be
in directing a portion of so large afum to
the making of public roads, especially if
neceflary? Were this done by the date,
the tolls might be so regulated as to pro
duce twenty or ten percent, according to
its general or partial use. The people
would willingly pay to support a road
which belongs to them, because though the
tax were heavy, it would make other taxes
lighter; for whatever is gained by the
public at large, is gained by every indivi
dual. If the expellees ofthe road brought
in a large profit, the slate would be enabled
to extend the public works on every fide ;
and though it might, at firft, seem to iiu
pofe an unneceffiry tax upon that part of
the community which is too remote to
feel the benefits of a local improvement,
the tax is already collected, and the interest
might be so high, as to latisfy the molt dis
tant members of the date that the public
money was well applied. If the rights are
ceded to individuals, where are the bene>-
fits to the community ? They are fuffered to
accumulate interest upon interest, while
the national moitey is deposited in a bank,
where there cannot be so high an interelt,
nor so fafe a deposit 1 â
I will fay a few things concerning the
CanÂ»l which is in embryo.
The second part of what was premised
includes two confederationsâ'The plea of
nccejfity ar.d public good. â
People of Pennf) Ivania, beware '.
Is it neceflary that the property of an
individual flull be taken away to enrich
another individual ? The canal company
is a private company, and the legislature
hai no power, whatever, to force any per
Jon into a cejjinn of his land, for the emolu
ment of another, Upon any pretext! They
seize the land, open a paflage, and desire
an appointment of arbitratorsâThe peo
ple have submittedâperhaps many from
an idea it may be ufeful to them,in thefeca
fes they make private agreements; both par
tiej are fatisfied,& I am fatisfied .But if the
company pretend, in virtue of any powers
derived from the date representatives, to
enforce a compliance with their willies, it
becomes an uncotiftitutional and unlawful
aÂ£t. The plea of n?ceflity cannot be taken
here, for no man is endangered by the
want of a canal. If the idea of public
good be resorted to, the public cession of
the turnpike road, to a private company,
is a direit denial of what is urged ; for, if
the public do not think it of diffident con
sequence to induce them to undertake it,
the reason is plain ; viz. it will not pay
the expence, without laying toto great a
burthen upon them ; and if it will not be
productive,that is, if it will not exceed the
common interest of money, without bsing
oppreflive to the people, how Jhall it be
productive of ten or fifteen per centum,
without a molt opprellive and injurious
toll ?âlt is in vain to recur to the firft ob
servation, of its being left undone, if not
executed by a private companyâbecause,
though the date may not at tAis juncture
consider itfelf fufficiently rich, to advance
money on public works, the time cannot
be distant, when that objefrion (if admit
ted now) can have the flisdow of validity,
tffpecially when we consider the many
taxes, duties, and imposition ,; under which
we at present groan 1 I 1
Every man whose land is trefpafled up
on, by either the high-way diggers, by or

Mr. FreneAU,
T AM fully convinced that the generil

In the escape which I luckily made from
the late unfortunate Trench court, I loft
all my feudal property, of immense value
which had descended to me from my an

duke of A. Marquis of B. and count of C;
and, infhort, lord of the whole alphabet.
All this I fuffered with the magnanimity of
a man, as. far as my own interests were
concerned/but I will candidly confels the
fevered blow I experienced was the un

Louis the sixteenth. TofpHl that blood
by the Guillotine, which was tlfe feed of
all nobility, and pure as the (Ireamj that

hard, how cruel an affront, how greatly to

that, enlightened asihe world has become,
there is still an immense diltance between
the king and the vuffal, the master and the
slave. The perpetration of this sanguina
ry act was therefore atlealt equal ill enor
mity to the crime of that traveller who kil
led a thief on the high way merely because
he had robbed his father.
You will all', me, perhaps why I fliould
take so warm an interelt 011 this queftian,
as I doâbut please to observe. Sir, that al
tho' wholly unknown to Joseph or Leo
pold, the prince o.f Pruflia, or the queen
ofthe two Sicilies,! have notwithltandiftg
had the honour of being for some moments
the brother in law of personages as impor
tant as them âand this is one reason for
the invectives I utter.
At the present juncture the new govern
ment of France pretends to be mild, jult
and fugacious : but that will aot ato:;e for
its having aflcd on a late occasion at once
against found policy, nature, and religion.
They did not act with policy, bccanfe it
was certain the ast of taking away the
king's life would unite all the Catholic
& protestant powers against them in a ge
neral war, which would be a fad draw
back to the fpcedy elevation of the repub
lic, and would be the cause of utter ruin to
all such democrats as Aiould fall within the
reach of their pernicious claws. Secondly,
they infalted religion because the inajefty
of France was the mo ft C"hriflian in the
whole worldâlt was (thirdly) unnatural,
because they did to Louis, what not a sin
gle member of the convention would have
chofeu to have had done for himfelf.
What anfvver can be urged tothefeun
anfwerable reasonsâWhere is the learned
patriot that can give me a categorical re
ply ?
Another great source of my disquiet, as
well as of several other deserving Ameri
can friends,is in the word EQUALITY.
Would toGod I had applied niyfelf a lit
tle more to fiudy instead of wafting the
prime of my clays in riding the great horse,
dancing, caroufin-g, and frothy coaverfati
on. In that cafe every writer would have
vanished before my fuipendous abilitiesâ
nature has been profufe to me in mental
gif ts, but for want of attention, practice,
and observation, I fcarccly know how to
write in a Itile above contempt. Now,
indeed it would star.d me in some stead,
and alter having been concerned in giving
laws, I might find it to my interest to give
some leflons To tell the truth, I wÂ»ih the
very thoughts cf niy former elevation an
nihilated.
How unpolite the praflice of the mecha
nics and low people in this country to
walk the streets without taking off their
hats and bowing to gentlemen as they pass!
Is jt repugnant to one's feelings to'fee a
ma 11 who I would riot choose for my foot
man, pretending to be rry equal ! My
philofopby subscribes to no such thing.â
My birth, character, and flatinn have con-'
vinced me that there is a prodigious differ
ence between me and a tayior. However,
it is too true that the u orld goes all on the
wrong fide of the question. Even the co
lour of things is changed, and of late the
blue, white,and >edfairly fick-.iin:y organs
of vilion.
0 then dear, ancient court of France !
once the delegable and brilliant!âbut it
is now all over, and dismal mourning has
spread its midnight mantle over the beau
tiful and splendid fun of royalty. Religi
on itfelf is no more. Lords and dukes are
metamorphosed into vagabonds. A tho
rough change seems to have taken place,
and every article of former belief is thrown
a fide ! Ye gods ! I do not deflre you to
change water into wine ; far the 1 rench
have already enough of it. However, two
or three dozen of miracles might not be
-.ifilels at the present time â Nay, it is pos
sible they might re-convert the people to
their tow discarded creeds.
1 will coafeft to you. Sir,that were Vin
cent Ferrers* alive (eventho'he should
have advanced his former price) I would
freely hire him to perform as many mira
cle-- as would thoroughly frigh'teu the
whole- assembled convention for what they
I have doneâand warn them in future never
to put a king to death again.
1 shall conclude with acquainting all our
dear- cro[[td chevaliers and gentlemen,
French and American, that a plan is now
drawing up for constituting a new arilto
cratical society, at the head of uhf.ch is tj
be a great secondary character in America
who is so xealous, acbive, and learned an
advocate of ourdoGrines that he has com
pletely and entirely confuted a noted de
mocratic writer, now in.Francc, and pro
ved his opinions to be wild and absurd in
the extreme.
Some Americans may with difficulty be
brought to believe it. but we kno.v, to a
nicety, who are our friends in this country,
in the name of whom 1 am authorized to
faythat aristocracy.a mocie of government,
so hated and proscribed by some, is Tweet
and delicious to those who are permitted
to have a taste of it, and fuffer me to hint
that it is at this momenf riling where no
body thinks of it, and will go on prosper
ing as the people become more and more
converted to its beauties.

Thurf'lay last, the fourth of July, being
the anniversary of the Independence of
the United States ok America,
was observed here with particular attenti

of Ghrift church continued ringing through
out the day; feverai of iheniitttTa corps
paraded and went through their exercil'es
and firings; many public companies and
private parties aifembled to celebrate tha
day, and in the evening there was a brilli
ant exhibition of fire-works at the upper
end of Market-flreet.
(Prom Paris, April 16.J
After the arrival of the contmiilioners,
-dispatched by the convention to Chantilly,
they went immediately to the Chateau of
the late prince of Cciide, ard having exa
mined feverai of the apartment-, one of
the company remarked ccrtain liitie tur

of the..thicknefj of the walls. Finding
that when fir irk. upon, they founded hol
low, they were ordered to be opened, and
within were difcorered a large number of
pieces of artillery, quantities of mufqnets,
culverins, carronades, bluuderbuS'es, bags
of ball?, -buckshot, iron wedges ; linen
rags, velvet carpets, eiubroidercd tillc
cloathes, watches, about three hundred
bundles of paper, air ong which ".. ere ob
served all the genealogy and family tides
of the house of Clermont. Besides all this
there was a number of rich jewels, feme
books of natural hi ft cry, &c.
Mention is made in the Baltimore even

ceived by way of Norfolk that the 1 n-lilh
had taken the French ill; nd of St. Lucieâ
and that Gen. Dampierre nad defeated the
Auftrians under Saxe Coboufg and Clair

that he saw capt. Brown of Philadelphia,
who told him that he was boarded by ; :<i

Capt. Brown told the captain of the pri

captain of the privateer ordered captain
Brown and his men to the forecaflle ; af

Extratl of a letter from a gentleman in
Birmingham, (O. i'.)
" I have found out a variety of ir.onev
coining prafticcs here, highly difgraccful,
I think, to the parties, to the country, ami
its laws ; and, in the inltances I lhall
mention, likely to do infinite mifchiefs to
the vast circulation of Spanish lilver in the
USlates. As early as May 1791 they began
"V itli the American copper cent, only upon
r. a ling the resolve of Congress to have
fn'cli ajrioney and the getting over a print
cf the American eagle. There were tliree
different forts of these cents made here;

Ind, however, this was merely an attempt
>f funic artiftsht-re to induce Congress to
give Birr.-i'j&han the order for coinage ol
their copper money. I have seen pattern
cards ol 11..ilings, fix pences, and half pen
ce s so base as to be niaiked tor sale at the
rate of aS, ;o, and 36 (hillings for the gui
nea. Quarter dollars and piftereens (but
principally quarter dollars) are split into 3
or rather four pieces. An exatt triangle
i; taken out of the center. The other
three pieces of debaf'd filter is ueverthe
lefs to be run off as halves of the quarter
dollar. The central triangular piece is a
gain coined down and is left rather plain
111 the dies (which were ihewn to me with
pieces of money) and the. crefcent-formed
pieces struck to, as nearly as pofiible, the
itamp of that part of a real Spanifit milled
dollar. The piltercens were wcrfc execu
ted.
I have 'also seen Dutch ducats, and
dollars, which were done as follows. The
ducat was cut out of a pure piece of foft
lilver to the proper size, and to be eafiiy
bendable in the finger, as pure ducats are.
There is rhen a thick Amalgam of gold
(which is made 01 quick lilver and gold,
and then fqueez'd thro' fhamvny leather)
laid on this foft silt er, and then Aruck in
the press to the lize and marks ol
the Dutch ducat of date 1753. This or
der came through Englifii merchants from
Holland and London, soon after the de
clared and open alfiltancc given by England
to their highand mighty.allies, the Dutch.
The value of those forged ducats is about
one and fix pence sterling, workrqanlliip
and all. They weigh about jdwt. 2grs.
and by weight the real ducat would Cell
here for nearly ten (hillings ; so that here
refti a profit of eight and fix pence on each
piece. Spanilh milled dollars are of three
forts, two only ofwhich I have seen. 1 lie

sheet of copper if a due thickness.and then
hooped round the edge with a silver wire,
so thick as to not expose the copper, if

silver) and is then milled to the copied

fort. They are so well executed as tc
pass eafiiy among others) and are in value,
workmanship and all, about one and fir:
pence The other, and more pure dol
lars (he artists are more close and fecre!
about, as being a better thing. These,
however, come to Birmingham in real Spa
ni(h or Mexican dollars, bought at the
bank and other places, sent down by lam

of other silver, have been so melted dowr

landed down to us in holy wrr, and from

ecure as to put a man beyond the reach of
ill poflible danger; and that however he
nay be protected by the great, the valiant,

y 011 the -Jfochegany that gives counte

n the absence of the owner, had in a fecrec
nanner introduced himfelfinto Mr. â'sdif-
illery house, wher<? at that time there was
â¢.Ã¼body but a negro lad. The officer was

eturtis being given inâE*ing brifidy en
raged in a remote part of the diftill-lioufe,

inployed in making a quantity of matches,
rom some rolls of.brimftone that had

.vithdrcw, and not recollecting the excise
)lficer, locked the door behind him. Near
in hour afterwards the matter of the pro
perty returned home, and going to the
till-houfe on some business unlocked the

ADDRESS of the Commune of Cay;:,
and the adjacent Parj/hes, to CittzEn
Polverel, National Civil Commijjtoner,
Citizen Commissioner,
THE Commune of Cayes and the
pariihes in its vicinity, feel them
selves jullly alarmed on account of certain
Tepeated adts of fevgrity, such as the ar
rell of their citizens, without affigningthe
motives, which gives us reason to fear ihat
we cherish the word enemies among our
fclves, and from whom we have more to
dread than from the utmoll efforts of the
insurgents without. The molt infamous
flanders are propagated, we are over
whelmed with grief, and at the indant
when mutual confidence should be revived,
attempts are made to divert our attention
"from the public interest by exciting ajspre
henfions for our own personal fafety.
Freely do we fay, Perish the authors of
these dedrudtive and murderous plotsâ
Perish tliofe traitors who spirit lip and
feed our enemies. Be they who they may,
or were they inverted with the highest of
fices of the magiltracy, they have richly
deserved death. But, assuming as we do
the glorious charadteridic attributes of
French republicans, we take the liberty to
tell you, that you are prohibited by the
law from overlraping it in any instance,
except some particular circumdances may
render it indifpenfibly necessary. We
â¢will further tell you, that all refinance to
oppression is legal; and if the "National
Convention have fuc!ceeded in breaking
the lad chains of despotism, if they have
succeeded in railing the cap of liberty over
the wrecks and ruins of royal tyranny,
they cannot confidently delegate powers
to you, beyond what are limited by law.
Citizen Commillioner, we will hold up
toyourview the seventh article of the
Declaration of Rightsâ" No man can be
accused, arretted, or detained, except in
cases prescribed by law, and agreeable to
the forms it has laid down."
The law, which ought to be adminis
tered with equal impartiality to all citi
zens, and did not adapt the word rcfjrmji
lility as a useless term, anathematizes all
those who dare make attempts upon the
sacred and unalienable rights of citizenship.
We reipedt your authority, but we know
our own rights ; and vre beseech you in
the name of the public fafety, which is in
danger, to return to those conciliatory
principles that give authority to your
'million.
The Commune, before a final rupture
"with you, expreffts its wish for a re-union
of all individuals in defence of their homes
and property, which are now a prey to
the Brigandsâit willies that the (word of
the law may fall only on the heads of the
guilty. They alone ought to tremble.
The Commune has also taken into earned
-conlideration the sudden embarkation of
citizen Matfolai, and (he critical circum
ilances of those citizens under sentence of
deprivation. The Commune is of opinion
you mud have adted under some mittaken
idea, or that you would not have proceed
ed to certain adts of authority the lengths
â you did, unless againd such only as had
been accused of real crimes, or found
guilty. Inthe firrt cafe you ought to have
manifeded your religious forbearance in
hearing what the accused had to fay ; and
in the second place you should not have
carried your orders into execution, ex
cept upon authentic grounds, and such as
ensured to each individual his life and li
berty. We expedt from you an explana
tion of the motives that induced you to
ast as you have done.
(Signed) ROLLOIN, President.
Esnault and
Cotelle, Secretaries.
A citizen then rose and demanded,
Whether it would not be proper to take
advantage of the re-union of this afTembly,
in order to declare the ft-nfe of the Com
mune tefpedting the nomination of dele
gates to form a Colonial AfTembly, and to
appoint deputies to the National Conven
tion.
DECREED by the Afferrbly, that a
Colonial Congress becomes daily more and
more indispensably necessary, in order to
do away those scandalous abuses which
exid in the civil adminidration of this co
lonyâthat it is rrquifite that deputies be
sent to the National Convention to implore
its protesting aid.â<

Â£Next in order comes t|ie Proclamation
of the Civil Commiffiotier Polverel,
a translation of which shall be given in our
ensuing number.]
Translated from a Paris paper, of April 16.
ADDRESS of the Couneil-Gencral of the
Commune of Paris, to the Citizens.
IT is no longer a time, citizens, for
weak minds to hesitate between liber
ty and slavery, the fetters of despotism
and the cap of democracy- Liberty or
death is now the motto of every true
Frenchman, and no other Can be pertinent
to our adtual situation. When ail l?d
it will be no time to treat with tyrants.
We mud either triumph over the ruins of
subverted thrones, or perish together un
der the wrecks of our revolution.âCiti
zens 1 there is no medium, and our fate is
in our own hands. A single retrofpedtive
look would be our ruin. Our career is
gloriously opened,, and evident marks of
fear are prevalent among our enemies.
They have fled at the fight of our armies,
and scarcely a day passes without an in
stance of successâbut let us notwithdand
ing be tipon our guard ; one fhameful de
feat may ruin the fruits of a celebrated
vidtory : like certain animata of prey,
whose pradtice is to attack a traveller at
the moment of his fall, our enemies are on
ly waiting for internal divisions, to seize
the helm of government from the hands of
revolutionary authority, and then to rush
upon us at once, and bekr us down with
their rage and numbers. What we do
not fear from their courage, let us appre
hend from their treachery. A constant
bloody druggie of four years ought by
this time to have made us acquainted with
the enemy we have to fight. They pay
no regard to the mod sacred rights ; and
our adts of good faith towards them, and
even our favours, have always been answer
ed by new enormities and the basest re
turns on their part. In vain however
were their oaths to trample us and our
[ new code of laws underfootâTheir wrath
has been confounded and their jiride difap
pointed. But their pride is not annihi
lated, nor their rage calmed. Despotism,
at her lad gasp, roars aload, and myriads
of slaves rush from every corner of the
earth, who with themoddupid tgnorange,
think it their glory to fpHl their blood in
the cause of the royal tigers, who are ne
ver fated. It has been the wish of France
to make them free like herfelf, and their
aim is to enslave her as they are enilaved.
Citizens, dained as they are with your
blood, they think they do you a favour in
offering you chains much more weighty
than it has ever yet been your lot to wear.
Your miseries are a fead to them ; alrea
dy in imagination they partition thecoun
try in which you breatheâand you,
Frenchmen ; you, generous republicans ;
you, whom these monders are driving to
plunge once more into the abyss of slave
ry ; you yourselves are reckoned a part of
the booty they cxpedt to find in France.
It cannot be, that patriotism, liberty,
and virtue are mere empty names 1â
Frenchmen, can you bear the thought that
herds of ferocious soldiers lhall take posses
sion of your habitations, and snatch fiom
vourpiouths that bread, wh ch our intes
tine divisions have in some degree embit
tered to you, but which it will soon be in
your own power to render sweeter than
ever in the bosom of unity and peace.â
Would you abandon to the difcretioriary
vengeance of a vindidtive conqueror, your
parents, your wives, and your little ones ?
Can you content not to transmit to pos
terity (that impartial judge) that liberty
which you have asserted for them as well
as yourselves ; or, jud emerged as you are
from the chaotic darkness of the prece
ding ages, would you almod as soon en
tomb yourselves in the contempt and ab
horrence of future times?âNo, noâas
we have but one part to take, there is but
one word for us allâTo arms !âOnly lis
ten to the howlings of the enemy, who
now aided by treason and traitors, have by
such means, and not by bravery, advanced
to the verge of our northern frontiers â
how aptly may they be compared to
bears and panthers 1 Let us cfedroy them
since it is impossible toglut their appetites!
Let France rife at once like one man,
from north to south, from ead to welt,
and like a volcano whose flame has been
long (mothered, let her vomit forth against
all hostile nations, her ships, her soldiers,
her philosophers, her law 3, terror, death,
knowledge, happiness, and peace !
And you, our much refpetted female
citizens, sex amiable and sensible, remem
ber that the love of country is alio the
voice of nature. Far be it from us to
blame you in the lead degree for your con
jugal tenderness, or your r.ffedtion for
your childrenâbut take care that your
love does not degenerate into weakness,
and, by a fatal consequence, prove the de
(tru&ion of those whom you hold so dear.
We are surrounded by enemies who threa
ten our deftrudtion ; remember too that
they aie enemies cruel and pitiless : should
yon keep your offspring with you, in vain
will you expose your own bosoms to defend
them from the fword3 of barbarians. If
Nature has found them rebels to herfelf,
surely they will not relent at your tears.
You will perish under their murdering
weapon f, and upon yourftill panting bo
soms may fall your expiring offspring, at
once the vi&ims of your own blind affecti
on, and the vengeance of foreign conque
rors.
You tremble at such a picture. Ye
husbands and mothers that encircle us,
tell lis what is to prevent its being realized
unless by afling the firm part of republi
cans, and adopting every manly virtue,
you set them at defiance ? Train up your
offspring in the path to victory, array
them in the military habit, arm them
with your own hands, oblige them to
fweai that they will never return till the
combination of tyrants is conqueredâ
and should the news arrive to your ears
that they have per 'iJJicdfor their country ; let
your answer be,lt was for this that ive gave
them birth ! And let the generou9 exam
ple of the mothers inspire in the daugh
ters a resolution not less heroic âlet them
universally enter into an engagement not !
to receive into their arms a lover who (hall j
not in our glorious cause have manifefted
a contempt of death, and opposed tyrants
in the field of battle.
Young citizen soldiers, what further can
be said to excite you to arms in your
country's cause? In rulhing to batt'e you
obey the voice of your country, and the
"voice of honor.âThis is your whole and
only duty
When the city of Paris sent forth her
firft heroes, (he astonished all Europe,
and rivalled all the departments ofFrance.
It was to the determined bravery of tliefe
elder sons of liberty, that this great capi
tal has now the honour of dealing the firfl
mortal wound into the bosom of tyranny,
and of being the cradle of the revolution.
The task of supporting the honour of Pa
ris is transferred from them to you. De
fenders of the fame caule, it behoves you
to learn how to fight andâDie like them
As to ourselves (the council general)
our official duties confine us to thi& spot.
Ours is it, to ihaintain within that tran
quility which it is yours to support with
out Our hearts and our belt wishes at
tend your exertioijs. We (hall sympathize
in all your diftrtffes and rejoice heartily at
your luccefs. Till vidtory (hall bring you
back triumphant to the bosom of your
country, you may reft assured that no caie
will be wanting in the magiltrates to pro
vide for the wjnts of your fathers, your
wives, and your children ; a duty that
will be ever sacred in our view of things,
and the nearest to our hearts.
