In the Heuft of R'prefentativrs of tki Unit
ed, States, Tuesday the Bth of May, 1792.
MR. FITZSIMONS from the com
mittee appointed to inquire into
the causes of the failure of the late ex
pedition under major general St. Clair,
reported thai the committechad accord
ing to order proceeded to examine all
the papers furnifhed by the executive
department relatively thereto, sundry
papers arid accounts furnifhed by the
Treasury, and war departments, with
explanations of the fame by the heads
â¢of those depaitmcnts in person, to hear
the testimony of witnefTes upon oath,
and written remarks by general St.
Clair upon the facts eilablifhed by the
whole evidence, and that as the result
of their inquiries, the committee had a
greed to the following Report.
The cniitraft for tire supplies of the
army on the routa from fort Pitt, wÂ»s
made by Theodofius Fowler, with the
Secietary of the Treasury, and bears
date the twenty-eighth day of October,
one thousand l'even hundred and nine.
iy. that at the fame time a bond in the
penalty of one hundred thousand dol
lars, with Walter Livingfton and John
Cochran, securities thereto, was enter
ed into for the due execution of the con
trast.
That on the third day of January
one thousand seven hundred and nine
ty-one, the.contract was wholly iranf
ferred from the said Fowler to William
Duer, a copy cf which transfer was
lodged in the office of the Secietary oi
the treasury, that by letter from the Se
cretary at war, bearing date the twen
ty-fifth of February,one thousand seven
honcfred Â«md rrrnefyÂ»x>fle, audreifcd "to
William Duer, it appears that he was
.considered as the contractor, that nc
correspondence appears to have taken
place subsequently to that time between
Theodofius Fowler and either the trea
sury or war departments âthat on the
sixth day of March one thousand seven
hundred and ninety-one, a contrast was
entered into by William Duer with the
Secretary at war, for lupplying the
troops with provisions until their arri
val at Fort-Pitt, and at Fort-Pitt a bond
was at the fame time entered into bv thÂ«
said William Duer for the due execu
tion of the said contrast in the penalt)
of four thousand dollars without an)
security whatsoever.
That the ast making provision for the
defence of the frontiers received the sig
nature of the Prcfident of the Unitec
States the third of March one thouianc
seven hundred and ninety-oneâl'hai
general St. Clair appointed com
mander in chief Oj the army deftinedfoi
the expedition on he fourth day of tin
fame month, and 011 the twenty-eight!
left Philadelphia for Fort-Pitt, at whici
place he arrived the fixteer.th day o
April, and from thence proceeded tc
Lexington, and from thence to For:
Washington, where he arrived on th<
fifteenth day of MayâAt the time o
the arrival of the General at Fort Wash
ington, theganifon there confided ol
feventy-five non commissioned officer:
and privates fit for dutyâthe garrison
at Fort Harmar of forty-fiveâat For
Steuben of sixty-oneâat Fort Knox o
eighty-three; and on the fifteenthday o:
July the whole ofthefirft United State;
regiment, amounting to wo hundred &
ninety-nine non commissioned officer:
and privates arrived at Fort Wafhinj
ton under orders from the commander
in chiefâGeneral Butler was appoint
ed the feccnd in command in the month
of March, and immediately proceeded
to make the r.eceflary arrangements for
rfie recruiting service, that he arrived
in Baltimore in the slate of Maryland
the twentieth of April, and continued
there till the thirtieth of the fame
month, that he arrived at Carlisle in the
slate of Pcnnfvlvania on the ninth of
May, and at Fort Pitt on the twentv fe
pend cf thefame monthâlt appears that

no monies for purchasing supplies wt'f
fyrnifhed at Carlisle, which was the
place of rendezvous, for the enliflec
soldiery, on the ninth of May, and that
Mr, Smith, agent for the contractor,
was actively engaged in furnifhing sup
plies for the troops oa credit.
It appearsby letters from John Kean,
another of the Contractor's Agents, thar
no monies had beeri received by him on
the eighth of May, and it appears that
on the twenty-third of March there was
advanced to William Duer upon the
last mentioned contrast, from the Trea
sury, the sum of fifteen thousand dol
lars, that there was advanced upon the
firft mentioned contrail, the sum of se
venty thousand dollars, in the following
funis, and at the following dates to wit :
March 2sd 10,000 Dollars.
Apr;l 7th 15,000 Ditto.
April 25th 15,000 Ditto.
May 7th 20,000 Ditto.
July 20th io.oco Ditto.
It appears from the correspondence
of General Butler to the Secretary at
war, from the ninth of May to ths ninth
of June, repeated complaints were made
of fa:al mifmauagemcnts and neglects,
in the Quarter Matter's and military
stores department, particularly as to
tents, knap sacks, cainp kettles, car
tridge boxeÂ«, pack saddles, &c. all of
which articles were deficient in quan
tity and bad in quality.
The pack-saddles particularly were
made in Philadelphia, which with the
transportation, amounted to more than
double the price at which they might
have been procured at Fort-Pitt, and
were found upon examination to be jn
fit far ate ,âihe arm's sent forwarcfap
pear not to have been duly examined,
and arrived at Fort-Pitt extremely out
of order, and many totally unfit for use,
which circumstance rendered repairs
absolutely necefTary, and added to the
delay of the troops at Fort-Pitt.
It appears that a great proportion of
the powder supplied for the use of the
army, was not of good quality, though
an experiment was made by Major Fer
gufon at Fort-Pitt with a howitz whe
reported in favor of the quality of the
powder. On the ninth of June Gener
al Neville, another of the contractor's
agents informed General Butler, that
he had not at that time receivedany mo
nies from the contractors, for the pur
chase of provi lions &c. for the troops,
and was obliged to supply them on cre
dit, that the country furnilhed provisi
ons in abundance at a cheap rate, when
money was had for the purchase.â
That lhortly after this information was
communicated to General Butler, at hi:
request four hundred dollars were ad
vanced to General Neville by the Quar
ter Master for the purchase of provifi
onsforthe troops.âThe troops arriv
ed at Fort-Pitt in the following order,
to wit.â
May 16-th.âCaptain Slough fixty
nine men.
May iÃth.âCaptain Powers feventy
eight men.
May igth.âCaptain Cribbs forty
men : fame day Capt. Guthrce twenty
three.
May 25th. âCaptain Avmftrong fe-
Venty-fix : fame day Capt. Kirkwood
sixty-seven.
May 28th.âCaptain Snowden one
hundred and one.
June 2d.âCaptain Sparks eighty
three.
June 3d. âCaptain Butler sixty-one :
fame day Captain Brock, eighty-two ;
fame day Captain Vanfwearingen eigh
ty-eight,
June cth.âCaptain Pike feventy
thice : âTotal including officers and
privates eight hundred and forty-two ;
and left that place in the following or
der, Major Fergufon with Captain Arm
strong's company, about the firft of June.
C aptain Snowden with the troops un
der his command on the day of
Major Gaither with about five hundrec
men, 12th day of Julyâand on the 22c
August the last of the troops under tlie
command of Captain Phelon, and Gen
eral Butler with the Quarter-Maflcr-
General, on the 26th of August-
It appears that General Butler, had
orders from the department at war to
protest the frontiers with the troops un
der his command, and that the delays
in fending forward the troops from
Fort-Pitt arose partly from that circum
fiance and partly from the temporary
want of lupplies of proVisions and o
thcr nece'faries, and from the want of
the neceflary boats for their transpor
tation, which were not in readirieis as
(oon as the troops were.âlt appears
that General Butler acted with ability,
activity and zeal in his command at
Fort Pitt, and that the delays of the
troops there cannot be imputed to his
want of judgment, or his want of exert ion
The troops met with considerable dif
ficulties and delays in going down the
river from the low slate of the water,
and arrived at Fort Washington 111 the
following order.âCapt Mumford from
North-Carolina, with about fifty men
on the day of Major Fergufon
with Capt. Armflrong's company, on
the day of Major Gaither with
the troops under his command on the
day of Colonel Darke with the
troops under his command on the
day of and the Kentucky militia on
the day of
The army, confiding of about two
thoufaud fion-commifTioned officers ana
privates, moved from Fort-Wa(hington
by orders from the commander in chief
to a place about five or "fix miles from
thence, called Ludlow's station, where
they continued till the seventeenth day
of September, at which time the whole
army amounted to about two thoulanc
three hundred non-commiflioned offic
ers and privates fit for dutvâThat thf
price of rations at Fort-Wafhingtor
agreeably to contrail was 6 | goths o
a dollar per ration, the price of ration:
at Ludlow's flation was 15 | 90th ol
a dollar per ration.
That the inducements of the com
mandcr in chief to this movement, ap
pear to have been to furnifh green so
rage for the hories and beef cattle of the
army, to inflruft the soldiery in fielc
exercise aÂ»d other necessary discipline
and to deprive them of the means of in
toxication, which were very plenti
fully supplied at Fort-Washington
and used to an excefilve degree by
the soldiery, to correct the excessive uf<
of which the mod rigid attentien to dif
cipline was found incompetent.
Mr. Hodgfdon was appointed quar
ter mafler-general in the month of
March, and continued at Philadelphia
until the 4th of June, he then proceed
ed to Fort-Pitt, where he airived the
tenth of the fame monthâno fufficient
caufcs have appeared to the committee
to juftify this delay, and his prefcnce
with the army appears to have been es
sentially necefTary prcvioufiy to that
time, the duties of the commander in
chief were much increased in conse
quence of the absence of the quarter
mafler-general, and after a continued
expedition of his arrival at Fort-Wash
ington, for more than fix weeks, the
commander in chief gave him express
orders by letter to repair to camp with
out delay.
The receipt of the letter is acknow
ledged, but the orders contained there
in were neither answered nor obeyed,
and his arrival at camp was not until
the tenth of September. The com
mander in chief until that time in ad
dition to the duties of his office, dis
charged those of the quarter-mafter-ge
ncral, and the military (lores furr.ifhed
by that department were so deficient
from mismanagement and neglect, that
many things eifential to the movements,
of the army were either wholly made 01
Numb. 57,
repaired at Fort-Washington, and even
the tools fur the artificers to work with ;
1 1he quarter-master particularly inform
ed the commander in chief that two
complete travelling forges were ferft
forward, and itpon examination, both
of them were found to be without an
anvil, many other things equally ne
cessary were cither wholly omitted, or
unfit for their intended use.âThere
were fix hundred and feventy-five (land
of arms at Fort-Washington the firft of
June, arid mod of them totally out of
repair. The commander in chief ap
pears to have been corrett and atten
tive in all his communications with thg
Secretary at war,- and to have difeharg
ed the various duties which devolved
upon him with ability, activity & zeal.
The army moved from Ludlow's sta
tion on the feventecnth day of Septem
ber, arid arrived at the place where
Fort-Hamilton is now ercfted, on the
day of they employed
about fifteen days building that fort,
and then proceeded in their march to
the place where Fort-Jefferfon is now
erected, forty-four mites distant from
Fort-Hamilton, where they arrived on
the twelfth day of October, and com
menced their march from that place on
the 24th of the fame monthâthat the
army at this time confifled of about 1700
non-commiflioned officers and privates
fit for duty ; at this time the army had
not more than three day's supply Â©?
flour, and were sometimes at one-fourth
and lometimes at one-half allowance of
that article, the deficiencies of which
allowance were made up by incrsafing
the quantity of. beef with which they
wefe plentifully supplied. The army
was delayed five or fix days on the
march from Fort-JeiTerfon, for the
want of provisions, and the fealon was
so far advanced that fufficient gireen
forage for the horses could not be pro
cured, from which circumftunce masV
of the horses were totally loft, ancl
others rendered unfit for service.
The orders to the commander in chief
to proceed with the expedition, were
express and unequivocal, so much so,
as in the opinion of the committee to
preclude the cormhander in chief from
cxerciiing any discretion relatively to
that objcct.
On the 31ft of October about fix.ty of
the Kentucky militia deserted m s bo
dy, and the firft regiment,- confiftmgof
about three hundred effective men was
detached with a view to cover a con
voy of provisions which was expected,
and which it was fuppofc J was in dan
ger from the deserted militia, and to
prevent further defcrtions*
On the 3d. of Novemberâafter de
taching the firft regiment the army cos
fiftcd of about fourteen hundred eirec
tive men, and oi> the morning of the
4th about half an hour before iunrife, a
general attack was commenced, and in
a few minutes thereafter, nearly the
whole army was surrounded by the ene
my, the action continued about four
hours during which several charges
were made by part of the army. wluc'/.
caused the enemy to give way but pro
duced no good effect, the attack was
unexpected, the troops having been just
dismissed from the morning parade, it
commenced upon the militia who, were
in advance of the main army, and who
fled through the main army, without
firing a gun, this circu-r-.ftance threw
the troops into foine difordcr which it
appears they never completely recover
ed during the action, the fire of the ar
my was constant but not well directed,
and it appears that a part of the troops
behaved as well as could be expected
from their state of discipline, and the
manner and fuddonnefs of the attack ;
the commander in chief appears to have
been cool and deliberate in the \vboli>
of the action, andthe officers tn.~erter.il

Yesterday the honorable James Iredell

plaintiffs were citizens of South Carolina,
vvhdfe property (with an express exception
ot their debt) was confifcated in that state.
The Judges gave their opinions, with their
reasons al large, and the substance ot their
apinionswas, that, as Mr.Bradford's debts
were ftnly fequelWed by a law of the, {late,
upon which no further proceedings had ta

the retreat was disorderly in the extreme j aftei
it commenced no orders were obeyed it any were
given, the men having loft all regard to difci
pfine or controulj all the precautions appear tc
have been taken tor the fafety and com fort of the
wounded which the circumstances or the cafe
would admit of.
The committee have had no competent evi
dence before them to ascertain the number of th<
enemy in actionâthere were various conjectures
as to the number, from different persons from fiv<
hundred the lowed tÂ« one thousand or twelve hun
dred the highest.
Mr. Barton, a witness examined by the com
mittee, conversed with g.'chfef at Niagara who wai
in the aCtion, and was by him informed, that thÂ«
number of the enemy in aCtion was one thoufanc
and forty, and that fix hundred more had conve
ned, but were engaged in hunting 2t the time o,
the adion. He was also informed that the ene
my had not colleCted in any considerable number!
until a few day 3 before the aCtion. This informa
tion appears to be corroborated by some other cir
cumstances fufficient to induce a belief of the fad
in the committee*
The contia&ors for supplies agreeably to thi
terms of contract weie to Jurnifti horses, &c. foi
the transportation of the supplies ; in this condi
tion of the contract there was a total failure,
which compelled the commander in chief to di
red between fix and seven hundred horses to be
purchased by Israel Ludlow, one of the contrac
tor's agents, to draw bills on Mr. Duer, the aCting
contractor for payment, which bills were endors
ed by the commander in chief, to the amount cl
about seventeen thousand dollars, were proteftec
by the contractor, and paid at the treasury ; the
persons employed by the agents of the contra&or,
to drive the horses, appear to have been totallj
unacquainted with that business, and from the wanl
of bells, hopplr.s, and other neceflarics of thai
kind, as well as from other jjrofs mismanagement
many of the horses were loft, and others renderet
unfit for service; âfrom which causes there wen
not pack hoifes fufficient to transport the neceiTar
quantity of flour from Fort Wa/hington fur the uf<
of the army on their march: this circumstance re
tarded the execution of the expedition.
The officers agreeably to the terms of contraf
had an election of drawing the whole of the ra
tions, to which their rank entitled them, or of re
ceiving the contraCt price of them in cash j thi
contractor's agents not being furnifhed with mo
ney for this purpose gave rife to a general order
by which the office!- was directed to receive a cer
tificate from the cofitraCtor's agent called a du<
bill, of one of which bills the following is a copy;
" Due Major H. Gaither one hundred and se
venty-three complete rations 011 the route to Mi
ami village as appears by Mr.Wilson's certificate/
(Signed) MATT. EARNEST,
FortWafhington, forWM. DUER.
Nov. 27th, 1790.
This due bill ifl'ued upon the officer's figninj
some acknowledgment of fatisfaCtion for hi:
whole retained rations, which acknowledgment oi
fatisfaCtion foims a voucher for settlement to th<
contractor, with the treasury department j ant
the officer is refufed payment for these due bills a
the pay office, all cafuahies by which these evi
dences of debt become loft or destroyed, are th<
gain of th- contractor and the loss of the officer.
It is fuggelted by the Secretary of the Treasu
ry, though not with politive certainty, that a fuf
ficient sum will be found due from the treasury tc
the contractors upon a final settlement, to covei
all these debts to the officers $ the general ordei
which had the operation before stated, continuec
in force about five or fix weeks, and was abolifliec
about the 19th of October. The privates of thi
levies received but three dollars pay each, fron
the time of theiÂ»- respeCtive inliftments to the iim<
of their respeCtive discharges, and were aCtuall;
discharged without further piy or feUlement
T:: :es ot viifcharge were given them, fpecifying th<
time of their service, and bearing indorsations
that some advancements had been made to then
in account, without stating the amount, the ob
jeCt of which is suggested to have been to preven
transfers j the intended effeCt was not produced b]
the mcafure \ the notes were fold for trifling con
liberation*, the real sums due on the notes wer<
various, from ten to twenty-five dollars, and the]
were frequently fold for one dollar, or one gallor
of whiikey \ the monies for the pay of the levies
did not leave Philadelphia till the 4th of Decern
ber, nor arrive at Fort Wa/hington till the 3d o:
January 1792, some time after the last inliflcd le.
vies were known to be entitled to their discharges;
two reasons have been assigned by the Secretary a
War for this delay of payment, the one, becaufi
there was no regular Pay-master to the army, ant
the difficulties of transmitting monies to the ar
my at so great a distance, in consequence of thi
want of such an officer j the other, because it was
supposed the army would be at that time at the
Miami village, so far advanced in the wilderness.
as not to admit of the practicability of discharg
ing the levies, the total defeat of the army not
having been previously counted upon.
The cloatbing for the levies appears to have
been of a very inferior quality, particularly coats,
hats, and ftioes, the last of which in many cases
lasted not more than four days, and better cloath
ing was furnifhed them upon their inlifting into
the regular service, which was for a time counte
nanced by the commander in chief.
Various modes appear to have been pursued by
the officers in inlifting the levies, which occasion
ed great uneasiness and some confufion j a consi
derable part of the Virginia battalion was so in
lifted, that the terms of their inliftments appear to
have expired the ift of November j the orders to
the recruiting officers appear not to have been
fufficiently explicit upon this pointâwhether the
terms of inliftment were to commence at the time
of inliftment, cr at the arrival at a place of ren
dezvous. The militia appear to have been com
posed principally of substitutes, and totally ungo
vernable, and regardlefsof military duty or fubor
dinirtion. It appears that the commander ir
thief had it in contemplation to commence the
ixpedition at least one month earlier than it was
:ommenced, with the force he then had, which
vaa not very different from the real force he had
n aCtion j but was previnted for the want of the
|uarter-mafter and contractor, and in consequence
Â»f the extreme deficiencies and derangements of
he business of those departments, the person sent
orward by the quarter-master being totally in
:ompetent for the business, and the contractor's
igents not being Efficiently supplied with money
:o enable them to execute their duties.
It appears to the committee, that in the wil
iernefs where vegetables are not to be had, and
:he duties of the soldier uncommonly hard, the
rations allowed by law, if completely supplied, are
inefficient. This circumstance, with others,
produced discontent and desertion among the fol
ders.
It appears to the committee that there were ap
propriated for the use of the War department, for
the year one thousand seven hundred and ninety
one, the furr. of fix hundred and fifty-two thou â¢
(and seven hundred and sixty-one dollars, and six
ty-one cents, and that there have been advanced
by the treasury to the war department, upon that
appropriation, five huhdred and feventy-five thou
sand, nine hundred and fix dollars, and fifty seven
:ents, to wit :

And that the treasury has always been in readi
ness to make the requisite advances upon the re
quest of the Secretary at War. It does not ap
pear to the committee in what manner, and to
what amount these advancements have been dis
bursed, the accounts noc having been yer fettled at
the treafury-a-nor was it poflible, from the nature
of the cafe, that they could at this time, have
received any concluiive or fatisfaCtory information
on that point.
(From the foregoing state of faCts, the committee
suggest the following as the principal causes, in
their opinion, of the failure of the late expedi
tion, under Major-General St* Clair.
The delay in furnifhing the materials and esti
mates for, and in pafiing the aCt for the protec
tion of the frontiers, the lime after the pafiing of
which was harily fufficient to complete and disci*
pline an army for such an expedition, during the
summer months of the fame year.
The delays confcquent upon the gross and vari
ous mismanagements and negleCts in the quarter
master's and contractor's departments ; the late
(nefsof the season at which the expedition was un
dertaken, the green forage having been previous
ly destroyed by the froft, so that a fufficiency of
fubfifterce for the horses necefiary for the army
jpould not be procured.
The want of discipline and experience in the
troops.
The committee conceive it but justice to the
commander in chief to fay, that in their opinion,
the tailure of the late expedition can in no respeCt
be imputed to his conduCt, either at any time be
fore or during the aCtion ; but that as his conduCt
in all the preparatory arrangements was marked
with peculiar ability and zeal, so his conduCt du
ring the aCtion furnifhed strong teitimonies of his
coolness and intrepidity.
The committee suggest as reasons for leaving
the number of the troops at particular periods,
and the dates of some faCts blank, the want of
fufficient time to complete the report with minute
ness, and in some inflances, the want of the neces
sary evidence.
The said report being read,
Resolved, That this House will early in the
next feflion proceed to take the fame into consi
