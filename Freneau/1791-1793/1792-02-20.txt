to appropriate their funds towards procu

In the present situation of public affairs,
tis highly proper that the yeomanrj

LONDON. Nov. 30.
We, in Europe, are now all at peace, one
with another, therefore have time to re
tieft on the horrors of -war. We have lei
sure to look into our affairs at home, and
to coniider of the consequences of our pall
enormous folly, in seconding the prince ol
the power of the air, by our gun powder,
in the deftruftion of mankind.
What, in the name of God! (for it is
here not taken in vain) have we been about,
and for what ends, within this century,
in this hellish business ! we have excited
(by the means of money, or large stipends
to too many dissolute officers, and some
finall pittance to the tools of war, and by
the promise of glory, like that which Mil
ton formed for Satan in Pandemonium) fe
deral hundred thousand men, unknown to
Numb. 33.
?ach other---to blow each other to atoms:
to make a milhon of widowsand more or
phansâto leave the cultivation of lands
to a peasantry beggared by the taxes(raifed
for the lupport of these horrors)âto press
down the hands of industry and commerce
by the faiiie burden sâto increase the num
ber ot poor, of course, in all our different
di!tncrs---to mal;e the rich callous to
their cr:e-., through the frequency and
the loudnefi of them, and deaf to all con
uderatfone, befdes their own interest, and
the feturities on which they place it-- â
and, as the center-Hone in this ufeful arch
to al.enate the minds of Christians (for we
an, except the Turks, pretend to be such)
cordially from each oiher, at home and a
broad. In fb.Ort, to reduce one third part
of ourfelvfes to the nature of tigers, ano
nier third to that offubtle serpents, and the
remainder into the condition of Ihorn
lambs, trembling at the violence of the
fii it, anc. the political hypocrisy of the se
cond fort of brutes.
Is no: the above a true piclure of some
of the consequences or all our wars ! our
histories, our gazettes, our annual lilts of
our armies and navies, our hospitals, our
lame and wounded poor, our lone re
giflers of half-relieved paupers, our un
do* hed peasants, our accumulation of
farms into one, our extensive round of
taxes and duties, on almost all the necessa
ries of life ; our annual pofTeflion of a hun
dred thousand negroes to support our lux
uries ; our unbounded, barren wastes ; the
pel petual enormous drains of money for
our large useless Handing armie-, and our
jotting fleets, both far better employed in
husbandry and commerce ; and, to wind up
the tale, our increasing funds, all compole
such a conitel.ation of evidence againftwar,
that madness alone, tho' under some sober
malk, mult: have been the occasion of such
wars m Europe, contrary to the plan and
repeated command of her C od in his word;
contrary to the dictates of reason in our
heads, and of humanity in our hearts :
contrary to tie natiOlls, except
the fla\ es ot Mahomet ; and diredtly a
gjiinlt the present and eternal interest of
almolt every individual in a christian ffate !
1 hole who are callous enough to defend
the {lave trade in cool blood, with our
pai liamentary evidence in their hands, are
alone; fit to defend the horrors of war.
But iomething active must be done, to de
it at the root. What then is to be
advised P V\ ould this counsel be amiss t
It not, take it, whence it comes is no mat
ter of consequence, whether from a Prince
or a Plebeian.
I. Dilband all your armies, and turn
yourfh.ps of war, of every kind, into mer
chant iljps, by common consent. 2. Train
all your mails from 16 to 60 (except ma
giffrates quakers, priests, and physicians)
to the U se of arms, for home defence,
one month in every year. 3. Make a
league together, and call it the league of
tuiopeâ 1 hat, if any one of the pow
ers fliall employ any force against another,
Â° n ""J ,?" ounc whatsoever, befkics for
mere felf-defence, with regard to life, li
berty, or property, the reft fliall join against
the offending power, and reduce it to rea
n lor the common good ; after holding a
congress of the powers, by their ambassa
dors, to discuss the cause of offence, and
having a majority of the congress for such
reduction. 4. Plough up your wastes by
your cashiered armies; thefailors will fall,
of course, into the line of commerce. 5.
Encourage all fefts to spread scriptural, spi
ritual, rational religion; and despise all
forms ( which are mere shadows) in compa
nfon of it; making the love of God and
man the beginning, middle, and end of all
your views, Thus, and thus alone, shall
the God of peace be with you all for ever !

' SPIRIT OF GOVERNMENTS.
NO Government is perhaps reducible t<
a sole principle of operation. When
the theory approaches neareit to this cha
rafter, different and often heterogeneou
principles mingle their influence in the ad
ministration. It is ufeful nevertheless t<
analyse the several kinds of government
and to characterize them by the spirit whicl
predominates in each.
Montesquieu has resolved the great oper
ative principles of government into tear
honor, and virtue, applying the firft to pun
defpotifins, the second to regular monar
chies, and the third to republics. The por
tion of truth blended with the ingenuity o
this system, fufficiently jultifies the admira
tion bestowed on its author. Its accuracy
however can never be defended against the
criticisms which it has encountered- Mon
tesquieu was in politics not a Newton or ;
Locke, who eftabliflied immortal systems
the one in matter, the other in mind. He
was in his particular science what Bacor
was in universal science : He lifted the vei
from the venerable errors which enflavec
opinion, and pointed the way to those lu
minous truths of which he had but a glimpse
himfelf.
May not governments be properly divi
ded, according to their predominant (pirii
and principles into three species of whicl
the following are examples ?
Firjl. A government operating by a per
manent military force, which at once main
tains the government, and is maintained b\
it; which is at once the cause of burden:
on the people, andnf fubmifliou in the peo
ple to their burdens. Such have been tlit
governments under which human nature
has groaned through every age. Such are
the governments which ltill oppress it in
almost Â«-very country of Furope. the ninr
ter of the globe which calis itfelf the pat
tern of civilization, and the p.-ide of hu
manity.
Secondly. A government operating b;
corrupt influence : substituting the motive
of private interest in place of public duty ;
converting its pecuniary d.fpenfations intc
bounties to favorites, or bribes to oppo
nents ; accommodating its measures to th<
avidity of a part of the nation instead of tin
benefit of the whole : in a word, enliftin;
an army of interefled partizans, whoti
tongues, whose pens, whose intrigues, am
whose active combinations, by fupplyin;
the terror of the sword, may support a rea
domination of the few, under an apparen
liberty of the many. Such a government
wherever to be fount}, is an impostor. I
is happy for the new world that it is not 01
the weft fide of the Atlantic. It will bi
both happy and honorable for the Ullitei
States, if they never tC iiiim'.c tin
costly pageantry of its form, nor betra;
themlelves into the venal spirit of its ad
minHtration,
Thirdly. A government, deriving its ener
yy from the will of the focietv, and opera
Ling by the reason of its measures, on tht
tioderf landing and interest of the society
such is the government for which philofo
phy has been searching, and humanity beei
lighing, from the molt remote ages. Sue!
are the republican governments which it i
the glory of America to have invented, am
her unrivalled happiness to poflefs. Ma;
her glory be compieated by every improve
ment on the theory which experience ma;
teach ; and her happiness be perpetuatec
by a system of administration correfpondinj
with the purity of the theory.

WORCESTER, Feb 2-
A correspondent observes, that, " without an;
comment on the principle of the present unhapp;
Indian war v as a righteous one is frequently con
demned, through ignorance, l'o a pretext is neve
wanting to countcnance one that is unjust) thi
laconick and humane addrefi of the 1 ifiaffagi
Chief to his victorious warriors in the late un
fortunate conflict, who generously called then
off from the bloody pursuit, commanding then
to let the fugitives escape, for they had killec
enough, exprclles greater dignity of ftntiment
and magnanimity of foul, than is recorded~m~th
annals of ancient or modern hiflory. And 1
premiums are generously beflowed on him tha
bravely rescues one unfertuuate vidUm from def
truition, what diltinguifhed mark of honor doe
that man deserve, who respites hundreds of hi
fellow beings from impending ruin ! Who, in th
proud moment of victory, can nobly check th
deflroying impulse, laying,-- thus far (halt thoi
Â£0, and no farther----and here ihail thy prou<
triumphs be flayed !
" With due deference to a most laudable in
ftitution, 1 would propose that, as a teftimonis
of gratitude for the prei'ervation of our furvivinj
friends, a gold medal be presented to the MifTaf

The gallant General StArks, in the
Indian wars previous to the revolution ?
commanded a company of rangers, coin
poled of hardy huntlinen, who could endure
the cold, wet, and fatigue ; and knew how
to fight the Indians in their own way.
When he was told that we had fuftaineo a
heavy loss in the late defeat of our frontier
army, he replied, that he lamented the fall
of so many excellent officers but could not
think the country fultained any loss by the
killing of two-dollar-Mem.

One of the plans laid before the legillaturc of
the United States, byM. D. L .Morel, lor ci
vilizing the Indians, is laid to be the encourag

is well known, was the foimer policy among
the Fiench when they held Canada, and ope-ia
ted so powerfully in attaching the Indian tubes
to that nation, that they could at all times com
mand them, 10 the prejudice of iheEnghiii.
Hence too, it is thought, originated the filial
tiyle of attention in use among the savages to the
Fiench monaich, whom they always teimed their
father, wheieas it was by dint of great ptefents
only that they could be brought to call the king
of England their brother.

"It was, formerly, an idea of Louis 14th
that the French empire might be made umver
fal by universally extending the French lan
guage. The effe&s of this policy are observable
to the present day in Europe ; the F ench beinj
the prevailing language of every court, r.ot ever
excepting the barbarous court of RutTia. Intel
ligence has, of late, by some means or other
leaked out, that to prevent the project of Louis
the 14th being accomplilhed, in a manner he
never dreamt of, the several courts of Germany
are beginning to discourage the knowledge of
the French language amongfl them, for fear
their fubjeÂ£ls Ihould discover that they are not
absolutely beafls (as was tacitly alferted some
years ago by the king of Pruflia, 111 refpefl to a
body of HefTians, who upon palling one of his

Genoa, bov. 9â" The French reiident
here, from the national aflembly, M. Se

not much to the tafle of the Genoese court,
but he is prudent enough to keep up a good
understanding with our aristocracy ; which,
considering the relation in which he Hands
to them, is no very easy matter ; and the
least infringement of which would be highly
gratifying to the French emigrants, reliding
amongst us. âI herewith inclose you the
speech he made to the Doge, on the king's

Mcjlferene Allies of the King of Francc !
I present to you a new pledge of the per
fect elleem and friendfhip of the king of the
French, in the inltrument certifying his
acceptance of the new constitution.âA
great revolution has afton.lhed F.urope ;
but is at last accomplished : and the legal

in the tumult of contending pallions, a
mongftfuch a multiplicity of interests, the
will of the nation and the aflent of the mo
narch, has laved the empire by rallying its
citizens under the standard of liberty and mo
narchy. At the present moment, they only
are revolutionists, who, like the anctent
Hero'trat.us, would render themselves im
mortal by the aggravating criminality of
setting fire to the temple of National Con
cord. They, who under the influence of
an obstinate attachment, are labouring to
envelope this glorious fabric of human rea
son [the French constitution] under the
clouds of prejudice; who deny the sacred
right of a monarch, to consider the prospe
rity of the nation as the great end ot all
his labors; how weak, how contentptible
are tl>eir efforts ? can the growing reason
of man go backward ? can the immortality
of truth do otherwise than triumph ? --And
you, august prince of this republic, whose
super-eminent virtue claims all that homage
that is due to your exalted dignity ; con
vinced we are, that you cannot read the
Const n x'tion I have the honor to pre
sent, with a spirit of indifference. Its
foundations are laid in the love of our fel
low-creatures, and, I may fay. even its
errors, ihpuld any be discovered therein :
In this memorable declaration of the rights
of man, France is forever prohibited from
entertaining ambitious views upon the reft
of the world ; happy in his people's happi
ness, fatisfied in their affections, their mo
narch has acknowledged the fame fenti
mentsj Already have our songs of joy re
sounded in your ears; fame has wafted to
yon the sublime accents of a whole nation,
thus addressing the God of peace ; Preserve
in this world your bejt, your brightejl image, apow
erfut monarch, who is a lover of -jvjiict:; and pro
tetl a people, who have jworn to live, die, and con
querfor the rights v man.'
Under the influence of these sentiments,
France hopes to ertablifh a more intimate
connexion than ever with the republic of
Genoa; and may it be as durable, as my
zeal is sincere for the interests of the repub

Correfpondencc between Earl Cornwallis and Tipr
poo Saib.
Earl Cornwallis wrote a letter to Tip
poo, which he sent across the river, along
with the sick of Tippoo's army who had
been left in the field of battle. He afiur
ed the tyrant that they had received all the
iffiftance and attention which was possible
in their very unpleasant circumstances to
live âlot so good treatment, undoubtedly,
is it was the wish of an English army to give
to those whom the chance of war had
thrown into their power, but they had re
ceived the fame treatment as their own
Tick.
Tippoo answered, that his heart was
warmed by the kindness which the Earl had
(hewn to his sick ; that it had ever been
[its desire to treat prisoners with humanity
and tenderness ; and that whenever he had
iÂ£ted with severity, it was when he was o
bliged. byway of example, to chaftifefome
unprovoked crueltycommitted on his peo
ple. He heard of the unpleasant circum
stances of the English army with pain, and
begged leave to offer to the noble sari a
present of fruit; that, from the beginning
of th'Â« 4 unjufl war, he had manlfefted his
sincere wi/hes for peace, and that even
now he had the fame sentiments of mode
ration as ever ; that, as he laid before the
thoughts of the heart could not be so well
communicated by writing as by coeverfa
tion, and therefore he still proposed rofend
a person of high rank to his Excellency, to
confer on the terms of peace.
Earl Cornwallis rep'.'ed that he would
lot. receive a person to confer on peace. If
Tippoo had any proportions to make, lie
mull put them in writing âas he mult fub
nit them to his allies, without who e con
:urrence he could enter, into no negocia
:ion whatever.
Tippoo said, in answer, that it was im
>oflible that his Excellency could meet
with any difficulty to a negotiation for
>eace in the Nizam, or the Mahrattas, as
here were treaties of friendihip fubfifling
jetvveen them and him which he had never
violated ; and he renewed again his offer
jf fending an Ambaflador to treat.
This was refnfed ; and Earl Cornwallis
writes to the Presidency, " That the Ty
ant was not yet prepared to make the fa
:rifices that the confederates might think
:hey had aright to expect."

[A TRUE STORY]
FROM four hem climes a wandering vefle
came
That from her size, or looks, small note cculc
claim,
Vet found throughout, {he many a gale had try'd
And Hill had Neptune, and his waves, defied;
Not fam'd to be the foremoft in the chace,
Nor yet the rear-most in the watry race.
Her freight difcharg'd ; compell'd in poi
to flay,
Long, by the walls, this empty schooner lay,
In vain the captain fcratch'd his sapient fcul!,
And fcrap'd her mails, and fuibilh'd up hei
hull-
Hung on the rich, or flatter'd up the great â
Not one would trust a poet with his freight :
No fails to trim; no woik, but mixing grog,
Pensive he flood, and figh'd to heave the log ;
In vain he fearch'd, and fiopt up every leak,
Andadveitis'd his barque from week to week,
All would not do ! âthe dock was flill her fate
Idle the mailer, unemploy'd the mate,
While, with the tide, she lay to rife and fall,
The wharfingerâtwas thought, would take
her all !
At length, a man who had much gold in flock
One morning fair came waddling to the dock
Addrefs'd the captain as he pensive fate,
And aik'd, What Jay you, friend ; zuilt' take i
freight ?
" Take it (said Jonas) take it!âthat I will â
Take it as quick as patient takes a pill ;
This idle life's the very worfl disease,
But let me know your terms, fir, if you please.'
My terms are Jo and so [the man replied] -
"What? fix pence lefsthan all theworld beside
What reason can be given, I humbly alk
That sixpence Ihould be clipp'd from every calk
Five (hillingsâ[trull me] âis the usual freight
And given by every shipper in the date" â
That may be so (the miser said, mod cool)
And yet there's one exception to the rule:
If you'ie averse, there's hundreds will agree â
Thislixpence fav'd, is meant for CHARITYâ
My terms aregoodâyou can't be angry, sure
Each fix-pence fqueez'd from youâ lhall blcf
the poor !

LEGISLATURE of the UNITED STATES
House of Representatives.
Friday, Feb. 3.
Debates on the Fifoery Billâon the motion to Jit ike
out the JitJi Jefi'ion.
(Continued fjom our lad)
Mr. Goodhue. The gentleman lad up (Mr.
kVilljamfon] fayÂ«s, that an appropriation oi mo
ley being made by the bill now before us, and the
reafury (landing pledged for the payment, â
heretore a diredt bounty is granted.âAt present,
ve pay in drawbacks about 4500 dollars ; but we
:annot fay that this sum will be adequate to the
jayment of the drawbacks next year : for if 2
[reater quantity of fifli be taken, a greater sum
nuft of course be allowed : and as the sum de
>ends entirely on the quantity of filh, it is impof
ibleto ascertain beforehand the precise amount :
:here is not however in the whole bill any thing
>f a bounty, excepc the bare name. The gentle
nan allows, that we may commute the present
Irawbacks, and give them to the fifliermen in
lead of the merchant : but it is imooflible to dc
his with fafety in any other mode than thai
jointed out in the bill.âShall we leave it to the
ifherman, to be determined by his oath ?âThij
vould not be advifeable.âThe plan proposed is 1
nuch less exceptionable one :âit is founded on 2
a.culation, that a certain quantity of tonnage ii
imployed in taking a certain quaÂ«tity of fiih :â
>n this calculation the allowance is apportionec
o the tonnage : if gentlemen think the allow
ince too high, let the sum be reduced j but let i 1
10C be (ligmatized as a bounty :âlt is no fuel
hing ; the word ( bounty* is an unfortunate ex
.refiion 5 and I wifli it were entirely out of thi
>ill.
Mr. Livermore. The bill now under confid
:i ation has two important obje&s in view. Th<
>r.e is, to give encouragement to our fifliermen.
ind, by that encouragement, to encreafe theii
lumbers :âthe other is to govern those si/her-
Tien by certain laws, by which they will be kep
jnder due restraint. Both these cbjrih are ol
;reat importance to such persons as chul'e to cm
>loy their capitals in the filhery business : and ]
relieve it will not be disputed that the bufinef:
tfelf is of considerable importance to the Unitec
itates, inasmuch as it affords a certain proporrior
>f remittance or exportation to foreign countries :
tnd does not impoverish the country, but enrich
:s it by the addition of so much wealth drawr
rom the sea.
It is the objett of those gentlemen, who favoui
he bill, that the fifliermen Ihould have some en
:ouragement, not given to them at the expenceo:
he United States, but d're&ed to them out 0:
vhat was, in the former law, called a drawback
if the duty on fait. The calculation, as I under
lano has been made as nearly as possible, to giv(
hat drawback, not to the merchants who expori
he fifli, but to the fifliermen who take it : in ordei
o encreafe that description of men, without whof<
ilTiftance it is in vain to expert any benefit from
he fiflieries : for if the merchants, at present en
;aged in that branch, polTefi'ed the whole capital
Â»f the United States, yet if they cannot get fifli
:rmen, they cannot carry on the fiflierv : this is
lone by a particular clafsof men, who must be
lot only expert sea-men, but also accuttomed tc
aking the fifh and curing it. If these men can
lot be had, the capital cannot be employed 5 and
hose who undertake the business, cannot carry
t on, or reap any profit from it.
Whilst the drawback is payble only to the mer
;hant who exports the fifli, it is impofiible to con
ince the fifliermen, that they reap from it any
idvantage whatever : or if some of the more dif
:erning among them do perceive an advantage in
t, the others, who are not so clear-sighted, can
lot discover it, and are therefore not disposed to
indertake the bafinefs. It is however of confid
rable importance to the merchants, that the fifli
irman ftiould receive a proper encouragement,
ven if they were obliged to allow him a bounty
>ut of their own pocket.
The government of the fi/hermen, after their
ingagement in this business, is also neceflary to
)e provided for : âotherwife frequent instances
nay occur among that class of men, of quitting
?ne veftel to embark on board another, or of Alie
ning themselves for a foreign voyage, before the
expiration of the fiihing season. In the latter
cafe, the vefiel lies useless cn the owners hands ;
snd he, together with the whole expence of the
Dut-fit, loses all his profpetts of future gain.
The two objects, here mentioned, are fully
vided for in the bill. Still however it is obje&e
to :âbut what is the obje&ion ?âit is, that the
word 1 bounty'' is twice used in this clause. Let
us fee what advantage will result from striking
out this obnoxious ( bounty SâNone at all the
bill fays it (hall cease ; and have gentlemen any
obje&ion to the bounty's ceasing ? Since the
bounty is toceaf' by this bill, what ad vantage is in
Ilriking it our The sense would still remain the
fame ; and 1 don't know why we fliould make a
law expressly to firike out the icord ( bounty'
Dut to ft r ike out the bounty itfelf- It is Grange
:o me, that any gentlemen, whether he is for giv
ng a great bounty, or little bounty, or no bounty
it all, should quarrel with this unfortunate word.
There is indeed one part of the section, which 1
A-ill readily consent to strike out 5 and I believe
: very other gentleman, who is in favour of the
Dill, will consent to it lilcewife j and that is, the
laufe, which provides, 4 that the bounty, to be
illuwed and paid on any one vettel, for one sea
"on, lhall not exceed one hundred and leventy
lollars. If, when the vote is taken on the fee
ion, there dees not appear a majority of the Houft
n favour of striking out the whole, we may then
nove for striking out theproviju, if it offen
sive to any gentlemen: if it be not'ofrenfive it ma)
emain.
lfgentlemen are disputing, only because tht
vord * bounty'' is in the bill, they may be perfefth
elieved from their unealinefs on that Icore : foi
he bill expressly fays, 4 that the bounty now al
owed upon the exportation of dried fi(h, of tht
ifiieiies of the United States, fiall ccafe, and i;
\eu thereof a different kind of encouragement i
Â®be given. Here is no reason to difputc abou
1 word : If gentlemen are disposed to consent t(
he principle of the bill, that the drawback of thi
luties on fait shall be commuted for a certain fun
o encourage the fifliermen, they will vote in fa
our of the bill : If not, they will vote again{
t. But it is impoflible for me to conceive, wh;
ny gentlemen under Heaven should be against it
t is only fixing for the merchants engaged in thi
iranch, a clear and equitable ratio, fordiftribut
ng among the fifhermen that encouragemen
vhich they think necefl'ary in order to attacl
hose people to the business, and to prevent their
"rom going to other occupations, on land. 1 lit
>i 11 is an important one, and will encreafe thai
Â»ranch of bufinei's, which is very ufeful to th<
:ommunity : it does not lay a farthing of boun
y, or duty on any other persons, than those whe
ire immediately concerned in it: it will ferv<
hem j and will not injure any body.
