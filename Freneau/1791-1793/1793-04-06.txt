Additional Report of the Secretary of the
TreaJ.ry. Relative to the Loans negoti
ated under the A:ts of the 4th and izth oj
A,.git ft, 1790-
f Continued from our laft.~\
THESE last bills were drawn, when thr
rapid rife or (lock commenced, anil
were fold upon a credit of three months
It was a natural conjecture, tftUt a rife f'
li.dden and violent couldnat b? of longdu
lationâand that a declension wÂ«,uld wort
lv succeed, which would afford an oppor
t unity of purchaii ig with advantage ; and
render the intervention of puolic pnrchi
i'râ  uivantajjpoiis in more than onerefpect.
The event fully corresponded with the an
ticipation.
With regard to the bills drawn in April
lafl, it lias been dated that they were di
rected to be fold upon a credit of (ix
months; thatthuf. drawn in July, Augutl
ami October ,vercmade payable, o ie moi
ety i.i two, the other moiety i 1 four
months. Hence, with a moderate allow
ance for delay in the sales, the period con
templated by the arrangement for the com
mencement of receipts was the month of
October ; that for their consummation tht
month of February.
The inducements to the draw ing of thefc
bills have been (tated. The present exam
ination lus relation merely to the qneltioo,
whether the bank of the United States., by
premeditation of this department, or fnb
fequent omissions, had enjoy d any undue
advantage from the of the pro
ceeds of the bills at the end of the year
1792, the point of time to which this en
quiry has reference.
T'le itatemeiK which his been made as
to the time the morircs received to that pe
riod had remained in d.polit might alone
be relied upon as a futficient answer. It
delinquency can he attached to the 11011-
empiovment of one or two hundred thou
f mil dollars for 1 few weeks in the money
operations of a :> ition, it implies a minute
.n-jfs of responsibility, which could never
be encountered with prudence, aud never
â will be fulfilled in practice. The diffrac
tions of attention, incident to a great and
complicated scene of bulinefs would alone
<jilappoiiit the expectation.
But I lave 111 are than this to offer, upon
the present occasion The opportunity for
inverting the monies on hand during the
period in queltion favourable. This
was experienced by til- Treasurer in his en
deavors to invest the fund arising from the
interelt on the purchased debt. There
was 110 part but the deferred, which coulc
be had at all within the limits prescribed.
Several indications of an approaching fea
l'on, more advantageous for purchase, were
difcernable, and a better employment ol
the money than at the then prices prefent
editfelf to the option of the Legislature.
This mode of employing it so medin rnj
wind part of a general plan for the regu
3ar redemption of the public debt accord
irig to the right reserved to the govern
ment. The one per cent, which might bt
saved, was regarded as 0:1 c mean of con
stituting the proposed annuities.
Accoidinglv: Oi the }oth of Noveni
iier lad, pursuant to a reference of the 22c
of that month, and. connected with the
j.l an of redemption contemplated, I si b
initted to the House of Representative*
proportion for applying the monies in ;uef
lion, towards discharging the debt, whit
the government owes to the bank, and up
-on which an interelt of lixper cent- is pa)
able. This was manifeltly, at the time ol
Â»he proportion, tne molt profitable life
that couid be made of the fund. It ha
been already stated that it would produce
a saving, if extended to the whole two
millions, worth to the government an an
iiual sum of 20.000 dollars, equal to a ca
pital of 400,000 iloliars.
This proposition tended to accelerate
the employment of the monies 011 hand i:
a way the molt beneficial to the govern
inent ; and consequently to Ihorten the du
ration of the advantage to the banks ot
holding them, by way of elepolit. I fubmil
it to the candour of the f'oufe, whethci
it be not full evidence, that there was nc
difpolition, on my pa. t. to prolong to those
2 lit 11111 ions a benefit, at the expeuce of tlu
government.
The proposition itfelf has not yet re
leiied the decilion of theEoufe.

jeftion of niifmamigciiient and undue con

United States are reprefentecT a* unne
oelfUry, tending to afford an emolument to
that institution. for which the fc'yjted
">t. t.'S hid no equivalent advantage.
It will conduce to a correct judgment oi
this matter to re fume a point already touch
ed upon, arid to add here the turii, r iliuf
trations of it which have been pi'vmifed
to wit) that it on.wit to be a genti<ji prin
ciple to have confVautly in the toiiupand ot
tne treafnry, at its different plates ..'1 de
jolit, a Turn of about 500,000 dollars â¢ a
principle, too, which mini be undcrflood
with reference to the be; innings of the
quarters of a year, when tile chief publu
payments are made and making.
file following observations will apph
generally to the balances, which appear ai
tne commencement of each quarter. Tilt
greatell part of t'le interefi lor the pre
ceding quarter will have been then deduc
ted. But a part is always in a different li
t nation.
The payment of" interefi upon a publu
d. bt, at thirteen different places, Han ope
ration as difficult and complicated, as it i:
new. In carrying it into execution, it i
ui necellity to lodge for some lime previ
ous to the expiration of eath quarter, ct
several of the loan-offices, drafts of thi
Treafurerfor the funis ellimated to be ne
eiirii y, at those offices, with bl.inrtÂ» for ttic
direction, and with liberty to the respec
tive officers to dispose of them upon dif
ferent places, as a demand accrues. 1 hi;
irrangement has an eye to two purpon.s ;
:o avoid large previous accumulations at
points ; tofacilitate the placing
jf the requisite funis, where they are want
;d, without the transportation of specie.
I'he allowing of the drafts to be disposed
jf 011 several places gives larger scope to a
leinand for them and renders them more
>a!tjy saleable. But it is a confequwite oi
his. that a part of the drafts arroften not
>laced and brought into the accounts oi
he Treafiirer, 'till some time aftertheex
>iration of the qu.irier. The fund tot
hem of course appears on hand, 'till the
ranfaclionis completed.
Coiuiefted with the circumflance of pay
lg the interelt upon the public debt at dif
"ere'nt places is this further confeqnence.
The trail fers continually going 0.1 iron'

j\ffiinâthe fmns payable on account o:
the civil lift, at the end of each quarter
which amount to about fifty thousand do!
lars, exclusive of what relates to the tw c
Houses of Congress, are always in a courft
jf payment for some time within the Cue
-ceding quarter. The fund for them con
sequently appears in the monies on hand al
the beginning of such quarter.
Again : There are conltantly confider
-1 hie arrears of existing appropriations, foi
cvhich demands on the treasury are at eve
y moment pofEbleâthe times when the)
v ill be presented, and to what extent, ai
my time given, being in a great degree
0 itingent The arrears for the different
>bjects of the war department, can feldon
be ettimated at lefsthan 150,000 dollars.
It is presumed to be a clear principle,
that the treasury ought to be always rea
dy to face fucli arrears, as may be clainiet
ar every inffant, or within any short peri
od. An hour's difirefs or embarrassment
to make good a public payment, alread\
ilue, would be baneful to public credit, li
lias been a uniform maxim of the prefeni
aduiiniOration of the treasury never to rift
uch difirefs or embarraflinent.
Independently therefore of the weight;
onfideration of being prepared (efpeciall)
â vith a war 011 hand liable every moment tt
greater extension) forfeiture casualties.the
mere fatisfaÂ£tion of arrears, ought to cauft
he conflant reservation of a sum, thai
would be moderately dated at half the fun
which it has been alledged ought alw ays
to be in the treasury. It is to be observed
that it does not often happen, that the cur
rent receipts to be expected in ai:v imme
diately fucteeding quarter, are likely to
exceed the probable expenditure of thr
ijiiarter. The reverse is as often the cafe.
1 'cute thegre.iter neccffity oi maintaining
a coafiant ftrplus.
There are (till other confn'erations of
weight, in a just eftiniate of the point in
question.
The fnm stated, as neceflary to he al
ways in the command of the trealury, i
never in fact at the feat of the government,
where far the greatest part of the public
ilifburfements are to be made. 1 he deposi
tories ot it are the several banks tron
Charleflon to Bolton. The whole fun.
therefore can never be brought into imme
diate action, for answering the claims upon
the treasury. No part can be proper!)
viewed as in this situation, beyond New-
York on the one fide and Baltimore on the
other. Whatever part is more remote
than those points, ought not to be regarded
.is capable of being commanded in less time
upon an average, than sixty days, makii.f
allowance tor the nfual delays in the sale
of bills, & the usual terms of credit, which
, xperiente has fliewn to be convenient.
In eftimacing die effective fnm at any
time on hand, in the bank ot the United
States, it is neceflary to be known, that a
Practice for the Amplification of the 1 ret
furer's bank account, begun with the bank
"f North America, ha? been continued with
the bank of tile United States, ot this na
rureâThe bills drawn by the Treasurer
upon d rtant places, and deposited with
the bank for sale, are immediately pafled
to his credit as cash; though they are allow
ed to be fold at credits from thirty to iix
ty days ; and it is understood, that the pro
.eeds are not demandable of the bank, 'till
;hey are collected. He<ue the apparent
sum ill the bank of the United States is al
ways greater than the real; Ibinetimes to
x large amount.
The deductions to be made for this cir
cumstance are Ihewn in the Treasurer':
in If monthly llatement of balances No. V ;
beginning with the tit It ot June 1792, and
ruling wills the firft of J.inuaiv 1-9;.
The period begun with is that, when tlu
irfl inflalment of the loan from the bank
nas payable ; and has been feleftcd foi
this reason.
The propriety of tliefe deductions ap
Dears to have been objected to, by antic;
jation, on two groundsâone, that the bill'
iopofited anfwtr all the purpefes of end;
md ought to be credited as fuel), on the re
:eipt of themâthe other, that '-there is a
-egular and conitant influx <*f monies into
:lie bank, by the operation of these billsâ
md that it is not very material whether r
3111 lodged in the bank to day fhculd be
jaid to day, provided something like the
ame sum fhoulcl be paid in conference o.'
1 bill lodged in the bank one or two month;
igo, and the bill of to day (houid be paic
>ne or two months hence.
Neilhci the one nor the other of theft
two positions is correct.
In no sense are the notes, of the purchas
erÂ» of the bills, which-are taken, payable ir
30,45 ar: d (o days the fame thing to a bank
as ctijli. 'Tis evident it could not pay it:
own bill with thole notes. In this prima
ry particular therefore the compai ifoti fail:
âneither could it make d.(counts upon the
balls of those notes as cajh. Becanfe ever;
discount gives a right to a borrow er to cal
and receive in coin, it he pleases, the. a
mount of the sum discounted. Notes are
noi coin, nor do they confer an equal pow
er to pay. 11 is tree that a bank will ii
its discounts some calculation on ex
pected receiptsâbut it can never confidei
them as equivalent to calh in handânor
operate upon them in any degree to the
fame extent as upon equal funis in cash.
If notes payable at future periods were c
quivalent to cash, then every discount made
by a bank would confer a faculty to make
another for an equal sum ; for there is al
ways a note depolited for the sum discount
edâand the power of d fcounting might b>
the mtve txvrcift of it become i.ifinite. Ar
hypothelis of this kind will never hearted
upon by any prudent directors of a bdnk,
and could net be long aOed upon, without
ruin to theinftitution. It is to be observ
ed that the great profitable bulinefs of 2
bank consists in difcounthig.
There is but one light in which the po-
Gtition under examination is in any degree
founded. It is this, that were it not sOl
the Jnftrunientality of the bill-;, the specie
of the bank would be fonietin.es remitter
for purposes which are answered by the
bills. As often a;; this happens, they are a
fubflitute to the bank for calh, becanfe the)
prevent equivalent funis from being earn
ed away.
But this oily sometimes happens. In
llimerous instances the enttrprifes to
which the bills are fubfc.-vlent would uot
[Total No. i 50.]
be undertaken at all, were it not for the
power ot' ant'"i|>'tion, which the credit's
upon them afford. In many other inilaii
ces the bills of the bank itfelf would b;
remitted itiftead ot specie ; in others p:i
vate bills vvou.d be lubftitnted; in others
mutual credits between the merchants, to
be liquidated in the course of mutual dca.-
ings, would supply the call.

y T is to be regretted, that under a re
publican government, and among people
who have fought for its inefiiinable and
fundamental characterises ; there fliould
be any persons patronized by the commu
nity who do not contribute towards Sup
porting the enchanting fabric.
Bin strange as it may appear to be, the
liberty of the press, though Secured by the
con!ti:ution of the United States, is fet
tered : and by whom? Those very per
lon, who have been fanned into animation
bv the friendly breezes of public confi
dence; who, contrary to the principles of
atirude, treat the dear bought privile
:. of their countrymen with contempt, to
â i- uify a few inSignificant characters, who
irom their conScious tangibility, mav wiih
10 shield â  aemSelves under the banners ol
Â» vena! ar reffrai.ied preSs.
-11l Ei.gVmd, before the genial rnys of
freedom had invigorated the mi ids of the
people, the liberty ot the press was not
known : theart of printing was only va
luable to the governors, because it was
â¢â¢ fybject to the coercion of the crown.*"
but we find at a subsequent period, when
the representatives ot tlie people began to
have a proper idea of their importance,
though attempts were madebyene branch
of government to continue its fetters
" yet tiie parliament reiifted them so
llrongly that oppolition finally expit ed, and
the press became properly free in
and lias continued so ever linct-:'' and we
may farther remark that a crown law
yer, whose mind it is natural to fnppofe
was under undue influence, has not the
confidence to recommend any other re
(lraint, " than to punilli (as the law doet
at present) any dangerous or offenfive wri
tings, which, when publiflied, lhall on
fair and impartial trial, be adjudged of a
pernicious tendency."
If this was the language of a Minion, at
a crilis too, when the representatives of
the people were perpetually ilruggling a
gainll the ariftocratical branch of govern
ment ; lhall those to whom we have dele
gated authority, at this enlightened period,
when the whole universe is in agitation,
and zealoudy engaged in fapDing every
germ of disproportion in point of impro
per encroachments, either on the part of
the governors or governed, attempt to
introduce innovations fubveriive of the li
berty of the press ? But perhaps it may be
said, my apprehensions are groundless:
that the press is as free as it has been since
ill revolution j which is certainly the cafe
so tar as it relates to inserting any pioduc
tion which may be conveyed to the printer
for that purpofc* But what will it avail
us, if from the tax which has been laid on
newspapers, the poorer fort of people have
it not in their power t<Â» read them ? If
we intend by the liberty of the press to
ereÂ£t a barrier againlt the tyrannical usur
pations of those in whom we have veiled
power by representing their conduct in a
fair point of view before the awful tribu
nal of their conflituents ; surely the more
generally such information is dilfeminated,
the nearer do we approach to the object at
which we aim : Put if by this inlidious
tax, tlu'fource of this attempt is checked,
we are certainly as unfortunately lituated,
as if the pi cfs had been guaranteed to
Congress by the constitution. Perhaps it
will be urgrd, that as the tax is inconsider
able, it w ill prevent but few people from
taking the papers : to which I answer,
that if Coigrefs hive a light to lava tax
ot even one ..ent. they may extend it to
one t.'ioufand dollars : and surely it never
will be plead in exculpation of a crime,
that there was not much of itâAgain, it
gives thou a decided influence over the
printers, as an increase of the tax would
lelfen the number of fubferibers, and we
all know from v oful experience, that in
terelt in this country has proven itfelf to
be a match for integrity.

S I R,
T HAVF. lately heard much refpefting the
Cen'' s of the United States, and have
obtained I'ome with difficulty, having called
five times at the narional bank, and found
" no cents to day."
The value of these mud increase in gen

Connoifl'eurs have been deputed from dif

FRENCH NATIONAL CONVENTION.
ThursjAy, January 17.
The Appeal Nominal ou the question,
what puni[iimeut (hall lit: inflated upon
Louis Capet ? continued through the whole
of yelterday, aud the preceding night, eacli
member alligning reasons for his opinion.
The following are the moll remarkable :
Delligoyteâ" I will not enter into any
compolition with tyrants. I vote for death
and ipeedy execution of the sentence.''
Garran de Coulonâ" 1 am of opinion
we cannot exercise, at the fame time, the
functions of Accufcrs, Judges, and Jury.
The people did not delegate to us th* right
of pronouncing without their ratification.
I conlider that to be tyranny, when men
place thcmfelves above that ever sacred
law, the sovereignty of the people. I re
fpecl the opinions of those who entertain
sentiments different from mine, but I can
not adopt them."
Chabotâ" I vote for death, because
Louis has been a tyrant ; because he is Hill
one, because he may again become so."
Robertfpierreâ" Because you havee
ftablifhed youi selves the judges of Louis,
without the usual forms, are you less his
judges } You cannot separate your quality
of judge from that of legillator. These
two qualities are indivilible. You have
acknowledged the crimes of the tyrant.
It is your duty to punish them. No con
federation ihould make you hclitate re
fpefling the punWhment reserved for the
greatest criminal that ever exilted. 1 vote
for the punilhment of death."
Dantonâ" I am not one of those states
men who know not how to determine but
from political principles. lam a republi
can,anil do not hclitate refpcflingtbe choice
of that puniflmient reserved for Louis the
last. You ought to (tiike terroi into ty
rants by an inllexiblity of character. I vote
for the punilhment of death."
Robertâ" 1 vote for death ; and if any
regret remains with me, it is, that my com
petence does not extend to all tyrants. 1
would condemn them all to death."
Barrereâ" The tree of liberty does not
fiourifli, unless inoiltencd with the blood
of kings. I vote for death."
ECALITEâ" Those w ho have made,
or may make attempts againlt the fove
reignt* of the people Oeferve death. I
vote for death."
Condorcetâ" I declare that no circum
stance except theprefent, could inducc me
to pronounce sentence of death againlt any
one. 1 requelt, that the feverelt pir.iiih
ment, next to death, may be inflated 011
Louis; but in cafc death (hall be pro
nounced against him, I requelt that the po
litical eonlideration presented by Malche,
viz. ' Whether the punilliment ought to be
accelerated or retarded ought to be dif
culTed."
Lananal â " A republican is a man of few
words. The motives of my opinion nre
here, [laying his hand upon his heart] I
vote for death."
Barbarouxâ" I vote for the death of
the tyrant. In a few moments I fliall vote
for the expullion of his family."
Villetteâ'â¢ I vote for the confinement
of Louis as an holtage of peace. He is o
verturned amidst the ruins of the throne,
and will now close up every avenue of it."
Anarcarfis Clootsâ" In the name of
the human race, I vote for the death ot
Louis."
Thomas Paine â" I vote for the provi
lional confinement of Louis, aud for his ex
pulsion after the war."
BrilTot â" lam of opinion, that the only
way of avoiding the dangers which threa
ten us, is to pronounce the punilhment of
death againfl Louis, and defer his execu
tion to the moment when the people shall
have fanftioned the coultilution which we
fliall present them."
The Prelident announced, that he vas
going to proclaim the result of the Appeal
nominal. The molt; profound silence pre
vailed for fevcral minutes. He laid,
â¢' The Aflembly is composed of seven
hundred and forty-five membersâone of
these is dead, fix indif'pufed, two ablent
without cause, and censured in the minutes
conformable to the decree, eleven abfeut
upon commiflions, and four who do not
vote, making in all twenty-three member
who have given no opinion. The number
of votes is thus reduced to seven hundred
and twenty. In order that there may bi
a majority, it is nectflary that there should
bean union of 361 fultV: ger. Twenty
one numbers have voted for djath, wits
the demand ot .1 difcolium on tlie period of
his execution ; one has voted for death,
with the reserve of its commutation or de
lay ; two for death, not to be carried into
execution till peace, 11 ilefi ill cafe ofinva
lion oftheFrenchte: ritory, to beinflated ill
hours after tlie invalioi; two for chains:
31 w for imprifoqmeiit and banilhment; and
366 for death.
Th; Prelident then lowering the tone of
his voice, amidtt the molt awful iilence,
proclaimed the following sentence :
'â¢ I declare. thai, in the rtame of the
Convention, that the punijhment which it
pronounces againll Louis Capet. is
DEATH."
January 2 1.
On Friday morning,the Dauphin flo!e
down (tairsâthe sentry at the door *<kecl
him where i e was goingâ" into the Ifreet
replied the infant prince, through all Pa
ris to beg of the people not to lei 11 my dear
papa." One of the guards carried him to
the king ; when he heard u hat the child
had Hi id, he burlt into tears, and pressed
him to his bof'om.
The king took leave of the queen and
his infant son and daughter, at five o'clock
yesterday afternoon. The queen was in a
raving delirium.
Defeze, the king's connfel, is dying with
a broken heart.
M. Malefherbes is the man who announ
ced the king his fate in these words : â
uMy prince I know you are courage
ous, but I cannot forbear telling you, sen
tence has been parted."
" Well then (said the devoted king) so
much rhe better, my resolution is already
tormed. I behold, without terror, my lalt
hour approaching : and I (hall layiny liead
011 the block without any uneafmefs ; what
will perhaps furprifeyau more, is, that my
wile and filter think on this fubieft exattlv
as I do." '
Maletherbes fell at his feet and said ; " I
will never leave you, my good prince, I
would die for you."âHe was torn from
the royal victim by a municipal flitellite,
who tolil him, lie had orders from the
council that he Ihould quit the temple.
Malelherbcs departed, and fainted before
the door. He was cariied home, and is
much indisposed.
His ma jetty had embraced him, taking a
ring ot; his finger and (jiving it to him, fay
inÂ£ "Remember me!"
January 22.
THE EXECUTION.
Conformably to the arrangements made
by the executive council, Louis was yes
terday put to death at the Place tie la Re
volution, heretofore Place de Lo: is XV.
Twenty five citizens, of known princi
ples, well armed,acquainted v\itli t!.emanu
el exercise, and having each hxteen rounds
ot (hot, were chosen from each fettion to
form & guard of 1200 men, who accompa
nied the unfortunate monarch to the place
of execution.
Strong detachments from the different
legions were polled in the itreets through
which the royal prjfoner was to pass, and
also in all the avenues leading to the Place
de la Revolution, topi event any confufion.
and each fe&ion had a body in reserve,
ready to move at a moment's notice, to
maintain pub.ic order, Ihould any attempts
have been made to disturb it.
Cannon were also distributed in every
quarter w here it was thought they could be
any way serviceable, had events made it
â  leceffary to have employed them: for
even to the lall moment the sanguinary
taction, who pronounced the death of the
unfortunate monarch, manifefled symp
toms of fear that some attempt might be
Blade to rescue him.
Between eight and nine o'clock in the
morning Louis proceeded tiom his apart
ments in the temple, and cot into the May
or's carriage, who accompanied him, as
did also M. h.dgworth or de Fermon, an
Irith prietl, whom he requested might at
tend him. Louis was dretied in a brown
greatcoat, white wuiftcoat, black bree
ches and liockings ; his hair was drcfied.
The procefl.on, commanded by Mare
fchal Santerre, proceeded along the Bou
levards to the place (le la Revolution.â
One hundred Gendarmes on horseback
formed an advanced guard to the procef
fioii. The rear guard was composed of
one hundred national guards from the
military school. Various reserves of ca
valry lined the procefliou and patroled the
outskirts of the city.
The unfortunate monarch arrived at
the foot of the fcaffold at twenty minutes
part ten. He mounted the fcaffold with
firmnefc and dignityâappeared desirous to
ddrefs the people, but even this was deni
ed himâd.ums and trumpets gave the
Signal, and at twenty two minutes part ten
his head w as fevered from his body.
The place de la Revolution was so
strongly guarded by troops, that no person
was flittered to pais after tie king had en
tered itâthofi, lumeic., who had previ
oullv entered and near enough to the
fcaffold notV'ithf!auilin<' the indecent noise
of the drums and tn-mpets, heard him

Yelterday arrived here the ship John
3ulkley, from Lilbon, which port {he left
the 24th of Februaryâand Brig Kitty that
failed from St. Enftatius, the 20th ot
March. By these vessels we have accounts
that the queen of France was beheaded on
the twelfth of February ; that France had
declared war againit England, Spain, and
several other powers; and that a general
embargo had taken place in England on
all vessels outward bound.âAn account
from Oporto to New-York, mentions war
having been declared by Portugal againit
France on the twenty-lixth of February.
A committee of the Pennsylvania house
of representatives have presented a number
of resolutions to the consideration of the
houffe, tending to the impeachment of John
Nicholfon, the comptroller general of this
commonwealth, ar.d directing the attorney
general of this Hate to inflitute a suit a
gainlt said John Nicholfon, Esq. to recover
lor the life of the commonwealth, the a
inottnc of the new loan certificates, which
have been redeemed and paid at the trea
sury of this Date. The total amount of the
new loan certificate: redeemed by the slate
at their nominal value, interest included,
amounts to 63,0-5 dollars and 37 cents,
60220 dollars of which were fubferibed in
the name, and of course appear to be the
property of John Nicholfon. The report
011 this subject was directed to be primed,
and made one of the orders of the day lor

M. Blanchard is making preparations for
a 46th aerial flight from this city. It is
said, the place from which he is to ascend
will be fpacions, and such as may conveni

F-ifteen per centum per annum is the a-,
verage profit on well cult ivated vine yirds.
Mr. Lf. Gaux, by a Iteady attention to
the culture of the vine in this country'for
the lalt 7 years, has ascertained, beyond all
doubt, that thac branch of liulbandry will
prove profitable among us. He has tried
several fptcies of fbreipn vines here, & lias
found atl, by certafrr variations in the mode
of culture, to produce as fine fruit, in
deed rather more fu culent, than what is
produced from the fame plants in Europe.
In conference of so high an inteiilt as
above mentioned, Mr. Le Ganx's plan
will not only prove highly beneficial to the
country at large, but profitable to those
concerned in the bulineis.
Thomas Claiborne is chosen member of

Mr'. Paine (in effigy) has met with every
token of contempt and hatred from the
too.s of royalty and the court, 111 several
towns of t.ngiand, particularly in Liver
pool, a place that has long been famous, or
r ither infamous for the hatred of its inha
liiL.uits to the Rights of Man, as particu
larly evidenced by its being the principal
port in England for owning and fitting out
Guinea fliips, employed in the infernal
traffic of human fitfh. âIt mult be a con
folatlon to the friends of liberty, that al
tho' the i'lfeds of a corrupted court can
burn the tffigy, it is beyond their power to
burn the political principles of Mr. Paine,
which are Ipreading rapidly thro' Europe,

creed.
On the 24th of January, and inllantly
upon the news arriving ot the decapita
tion ot Louis the XVlth, M. Chauvelin,
French Aniballador at London, received
the following note from the EngliihSecre
tary of ffate.
" 1 am charged to notify to you. Sir,
that the character with which you have
been inverted at this court, and the f mixti
ons of which have been so long suspended,
being now terminated, by the fatal death
of his molt Christian Majelty, you have
no more any public character here.
The King can 110 longer, after such an
event, permit your relidcnce here. His
Majelty has thought fit to order, that you
should retire from this kingdom within the
term of eight days ; and I herewith trans
mit to you a copy of the Order, which his
Majelty, in Privy Council, has ordered to
this effeÂ£t.
I fend you a paflport for you and your
suite ; and I shall not fail to take all the
other neceilary Heps, in order that you may
return to France, with all the attentions
which are due to the character of Minilter
Plenipotentiary from his Molt Christian
Majeitv, which you have excrcifed at this
Court."

William Goforth, Esq. of Cincinnati
(western territory) in a letter dated from,
that place, Jan. 8, gives a circumstantial
narrative of the fate of Major Trueman,
Col. Harden, and others who were sent
lall year on embaflies, and with meiTages to
certain Indian towns, relative to a treaty
of peace with the United States. This
narrative was taken from the accounts giv
en by William Smallv, who attended Ma
jor Trueman, anil returned by way of
Detroit to Columbia, in Pennsylvania, the
place of his relidence. It appears from
this narrative that major Trueman, his
waiter, and Srnally fell in with three Indi -
ans on their way to the Mauniee towns,
the two former of whom w ere treacher
ously murdered hj' the Indians while in
theircompany, andto all appearance friend
ly. It further appears that the horses, anil
the other property major Trueman had
with him, was the cause of his being mur
dered. Smally se as informed, while among
the Indians, that Mefli's. Joseph Cerrard,
Isaac Freeman, and a Mr. Lavara falfo on
an embassy to the Manmee towns] were
killed by a final! party of the favnjres five
or fix days journey from Fort Walhington.
While Mr. Smally wis at the town of
Glaize, several articles were brought in,
the property of Col. Harden and his com
panion Mr. Flinn, who had been sent 011
an embaflv to the Indian nat ons, and were
on their way to the Sandulki towns when
killed. Col. Harden had fallen in with an
Indian hunting party, when, upon confu
tation, it was agreed by them (onÂ» excep-
kill Col. Harilen and Hnn, who
were tomahawked accordinglyâThe opi
nion of Mr. bmally is that the Indians are
generally for war. and that the rep'-rt
ampng them is, that at their next battle
they expect to have eight thonfand men,
rho' he queltions their being able to rai r e
more than sor 6,000. He adds, that the
Britilh are not at this time aÂ£tive to allift
the Indians in the present war wi'h the
United Slates ; but merely fulfilling the
agreements and flipul-itions entered into
with them at the clcfe of the American
war.
[From a .Crrrejj 01 dent. ]
It is remarkable that in the prosecution
of Mr. Paine, for libellous writii gs, before
Lord Keuyon, and a special jury held at
Guildhall, in London, that the \ ice-j've
lietent of the United States is expressly
named by the Attorney General, employee!
on that infamous occasion, as the writer of
the papers that appeareci about two ye:,r3
ago in Bolton under the fignatnre of }>u bit
cola. Mr. Attorney General, on the fame
occasion, not only read several paragraphs
from that work, tending to criminate Mr
Paine, but also the contents of a letter
which "he had received from the second
person in America (Mr. Adams" " Having
had the honor of his (Mr. Adams' ac
quaintance (Taid the Attorney General)!
wrote to him relative to the prosecution
and in answer I was informed, that it w :;s.
the wish of Thomas Paine to convene the
people of Great-Britain, who had neither
government nor conjlitution, for the pur
pose of prevailing upon them to adopt a
confiitution limilar to that of France, and
to establish a government proceeding, di
rectly from the fdvereignty ol the p c < pie.
Mr. Paine had aifo called on the citizens
of America, to rally round bin l , in order
to afford aliiftafice to Great-'-'M- ;ii, in the
completion of a 1 evolution," ! ! 'Mr. BRI'SOfs Speech in the. National
/Iffembly of France, on siugufl 8, 1792
in fvfport of the accufalion of M- de la
Fayette.
(Continued from our last )
MR. La Faycte will fay that he had
concerted with Mai thai Luckner
But iiad he conccrtcd alio wi h the Au
itrian General? H d he concerted with
fortune ? Had he her in his hands, at his
ordeis ? No, gentlemen ; he might be at
tacked ; he â¢was attacked in his absence.
Fortune has favoured our arms ; it might
have been othei wife, at Irall if it were not
Jli/ulntedio the contrary. In fact, gentle
men, thejauut of Mr. La Fayette was very
well worth a victory to the Auflrians.
But, laying a fide hypothesis, I said the
Aullrians were not tuperior in numbers;
and why then this everlalling maftion ? It
is a glaring crime. Either the Auflriana
were fnperior, or they were not ; and to
leave his army was to betray the state. It
appears by the account of Mr. Bureau x-
Pufy, that Mr La F*yette was in the
firft mentioned cafe ; for he allows that
1 he camp of Tenieres was a dangerous po
rtion ; he agrees that there were bu' eigh
teen thousand men, when the catr.p was
capab'e of containing fifty thousand, and
when there was in front a body of twenty
live thousand men. He owns that he was
ignorant of all the movements and projefls
of the enemy. He mull then have been
in contlaut ?pprthenfion of an attack ; and
lie exposed his army by absenting himfelf
from it at luch a critical jnndVure.
Again, gen lemen, if this absence had
had for its objeÂ£l the service of his army,
Mi. DumeLrd has told you, it was to press
the activity of the Minillers ; but, gentle
men, this anlwer is a mere pleasantry. Is
it ufua, o solicit the adtivity ot one's own
creature 3, elpecially when they have been
Itallied by ourfclvcs ? He has told you that
it was to demand military (lores ; but does
not Mr. La Fayette who is fnrrounded
â¢with a croud of aids de camp, know how
10 employ them ex ept in hawking peti
lions up and down in the different camps,
in intriguing at court an . in the city .'
Could he not spare one of them to hail en
the (lores? It is adding cowardice to cri
m;nali \, and impudence to both, to dif
j;uife the b fenefs ot his motives bv sub
terfuges like these. His journey to Paris
rould have no other object hue that of in-
Irigue ; it was 1.1 fadl peifc<iil> ridicu'on.;
fir t e came to make a complaint that had
idreaiiy been made, to demand a profecu
tion ihat was car lying on'; and, in fuppo
(ing that the law had permitted his peti
tion, tTe interest of the Hate, of his irmy,
commanded him either to fend it by the
prft or to charge some o e nith it.
I do not here speak of his quitting hit
sr.l y without leave. Mr. Dumolard has
not dared to affirm that he had one ; but
I luppofe the fatt true : I tuppofe it with
smother member who has deserted his pod
in the moment of danger : I suppose him
to have had an unlimited 1; ve : however,
lie ought not to have made use of it, ex
cept in the moll urgent circumilances.
To abuse it by ablenting hiinfelf, f om mo
tives foreign to the f rvice of his army,
and at a time whÂ«n that army was in the
moll critical polition, is treason to all in
tents and purposes.
You have been told that there is no law
that sorb ds a general to quit his poll. I
aufwer, that the law of the 30th of Sep
leinber, 1791, SiSt. 2d, slrt 10 th, fays:
" Every olhcer, non-commissioned officer
or soldier, who (hall quit his poll without
the permission of h s commandant, (hail
iuffer a disciplinary punishment by order
of the commandant of the corps to wiiich
1 e belongs ; except (onae aggrava ing cir
cumftances Shall determine tie Auditor to
transfer him to tiie cou t-martial ; and il
fit he transferr.d to this cou t, and found
guilty, he (hall fuffer oeath."âlc surely
will not be pretended that, if the law
(hikes at the funple officers and soldiers,
1 h genera! is to be spa ed ; at leafl if we
do not believe that the guilty ought tc
escape punifi ment, only when his crim> s
are ftich as may produce effects extraotdi
liarily fatal.
I e me to the second offence ; it has
been cl-arly prove ! by the orators w c
l avc gone betoie me. 'l hey have proved
l-y t' e conllitution, that the armed iorce
is ejjential'y obedient ,* that it has no right
J . ile ibcrate, and coi;(equently that Gen
eral La Fayette could not, without be
* The vjorJs of the Conflitution.
coning highly criminal, be die bearer of
a like rtqiic.ll
What dots Mr. Dumolard oppose to
this deinonftration ? He tells you, that
the rcqucll of the army was onlv indivi
dual, and that an individual petition is
not a deliberation.
Does he not blush to attempt the de
fence of one of the f r amcr of the consti
tution by si.cli pitiful fophif i s ?
1 answer Mr Dumolar I by that bun
die of addresses lying on the tab!., which
vcrv Well proves that there have been col
leftive deliberations; I anlwer him by
the petition of Mr. La Fayette itfe'f:
"The outrages of the 20th of June,"
fays he, 'â  have every w ere excited alarms,
and roused the indignation of all the good
:itizens, particularly of the army. In
;hat which I command, the whole of the
jfficers, non-commillioned ofTicers and sol.
have but one sentiment*âl have
promifrd to them," adds he, "to express in
dividually the general sentiment." It is
evident then, f;om Mr. La Fayette's own
words, that he was the bearer of the com
mon requefl, of the colledlive request ol
bis army, which, in the terms of the con
Hitution, cannot deliberate. He has then
violated the constitution.
He came alone, fays Mr. Dumolard
Well ! and what of that, gentlemen :
I'he petition that he brought you con
ained the request of all his army. Out
:annot with a word change the nature ol
1 thing. The petition was here collettive.
('though the individuality of it has beer
"o roundly (fined.
He may fay purhaps, that it is as all
ien, and not as general, that he has addref
ed yon. But he will not then fay that
t is the common sentiment of his army
lhat he has expressed. Let h'm chooft
lere : either it was his own individual-re.
tjueft, or ii was that of his whole army
In the firft cafe, he h<s (landered his ar
my, in pretending to be the bearer of thcii
:ommon lequcft ; in the Ltter, he is c>d
pable for having delivered a request p>ohi
bited by the constitution. But who doei
not fee here that the general, not daring
to attack openly the constitution, ha* tri
sd by a fubterfuge to cover his vialatior
t>f the law ? Who does not fee that he ha:
presented himfelf as a citizen 'n order tc
liave a hole to creep o,it at, and that Ik
bas prefenicd the requ ft of the whole ar
my to intimidate the National AfTembly
In short, who does not fee in this farce, ii
which the legiflalive body and the c<Ttfti
tution are so impudently iniulted, an ag
gravation of his crimes
Yes, gentlemen, it is very possible thai
in t e firft moments of the operation of <
constitution, the principles of which arc
not familiar ; when every thing temjs tc
provoke the execution of the laws ol
which the provisions are numerous and
complicated , it is very pofiible to violatt
the confti ulion without knowing it, anc
to appear culpable without being so. Il
is, for example, very natural to believe,
that the non commjjioned officers andfoldler.
from their being petfuaded that they did
no more than fulfil a sacred duty, in tefti
fying their indignation against the event!
of the 20th of June, were ignorant ol
what they did, and that every thing wai
disguised in order to deceive than. lam
therefore very far from regarding all theft
petitions as culpable ; but can there be
any one weak enough to believe, that Mr,
La Fayette, who himfelf assisted in the
revision of the conftiiution, who himfell
so kited with considerable vva'mth the re
ftridive law concerning petitions; who
has himfelf laid down the principle, that
every armed force is ejfential'y obedient: 1
fay, can there be any one weak enough to
believe him ignorant of this famous law,
this well known princ'ple ! he has violated
th :n wilfully. He knew them, fays Mr.
Dumolard, and he has adhered to ttiem ;
for it was to put a Hop to the coll.stive
reqnefts that he came to Paris ; that is tc
fay, that to put a (lop to a colledlive re
quest, he consolidates it with his own, and
presents it hinfelf: that is to fay, that tc
prevent the violation of the law, already
consummated, he gives it his fanftion !
he becomes the organ of it ! thus, doubly
to violate the law is to refpeft it, in the
eyes of Mr Dumolard.
What a cause, great God! must it be
that is reduced for defence to such
puerile sophistry IâThe signature of m\
letter of the 16th of June was doubted,
Mr. La Fayette has said you should have
signed it afre(h and ftaiJ a' your camp.â
But the king's life was in danger from the
commotions in the capita':âThe Nation
al Affcmbly was there rea('y to protefl
him or pei ifli by his Cde.â The fame fears
were entertained for the National Aflem
tily :âWhat ! had it then teftified any
such apprehensions ? Did not every day
after the 20th of June bring you fatisfac
tory accounts ? from the 22d was not all
q'liet at Paris, except in the seditious
minds of the ministry and the direflory oj
the Department ? What could alarm you
on the 26th that you (hould intrude on us
your unafked-for and infuhtng protection !
Had you forgot our troops? Could you
doubt that the forty tlioufand national
guards; that the piques whose courage you
had so well proved on the sth and Bth of
October, 1789; that the brave fellows
whom you had seen diflinguillied them
(elves on thole memorable days, would not
form an l'mpregmble rampart round the
person of the king ? Yes, you have calum
niated by your petition, the people, the
national guards, the army and this afTem
bly. This confideiation alone islufficient
to condemn Mr La Fayette, eÂ»en if there
exifled no politive law to that effedl. i r.
Dumolard has denied that there is any
law, which forbids a general or his soldierS
to present petitions. He forgot then the
a ticleofthe conllitution that I have just
quoted. He has forgot then the pofitivt
law ciied by Mr. i-afojree, and which I
Hi all read once more to the National /f
---fembly :â" Every deliberation," fays the
law of the 21 (I of September, 1791, "held
by the nati .nalguards npon affairs of state,
of their department, dillriÂ£t or commune,
except such as are ltgally referred to the
disciplinary councils, shall be considered as
a seditious attempt upon the public liber
ty, a crime against the constitution, f r
which all tho!e who may be active in
forming such afTemblies, or who may pre
side at their deliberations, fliall be respon
sible." This law, gentlemen, so impera
tive for the national guard, ought to be
much more so for the regular forces It
is impoflible to answer this argument;
and it is for that reason, I suppose, that
Mr. Dumolard has not attempted
Here, gentlemen, the attack on the con
stitution is so much the more crminal as
Mr. La Fayette demanded, in the name
of his army, a thing not only unconstitu
tional, but even impoflible : the abolition 0)
the patriotic societies. Mr. Dumolard has
told you, that it was not their abolition
that the general requeftcd, but the fup
pr.ffion of their abuses. This is another
of the cowardly fltifts of the enemies of the
popular societies. Are there not the laws
and the tribunals to putiifh these abuses :
Why not bring the offenders to trial ? It
is because the law would acquit the po
pular societies ; and it is more convenient
to the general and his party to crush them
by a decree. Such, gentlemen, is the real
sense (and Mr. La Fayette will not dare
to deny it to me, who knows his sentiments
on thefubjedt) <f that pafTage in his let
ter where he demands the annihilation ol
the-clubsâAnd why is he so exasperated
againfl them ? Because they do not fpart
him. He had but one answer to give tc
all his detractors ; âniSory
