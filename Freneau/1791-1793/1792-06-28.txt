*** The publication vf this paper on Mon

next paper [A 'umb. 71] will not appear till Wed

DUBLIN April 30.
The following is an extratt froiq Mr. Tandy's let
ter to his fellow citizens.
"In the month of February lall a mem
ber of the House of commons did, in that
house, take very unwarrantable liberties
with my name. I thought it a duty I ow
ed myfeil" to enquire if they were meant as
personal insult. The enquiry was answer
ed, (or avoided,) by a complaint of breach
of privilege, which produced a warrant to
drag- me before the HouseâThe melTenger
to whom it was directed, reported, that I
had escaped the execution of itâ-and the
dignity of the people's representatives be
comes degraded, and the laws molt inde
cently infultesl by prefixing an add rets tÂ«j
the viceroy for iHuing a proclamation to
apprehend me, without taking the exami
nation or oath of a (ingle person whereon
to found the proceeding. The conduct of
the Keprefentative of Majesty, and his pri
vy council in the ridiculous gal'conade of
their proclamation is diflinguifhed by equal
geodfenfe and temper, and with equal regard to
the legal feirms required by the co'nftitution;
foi- upon no better evidences are jullice:
and constables, and captains of lhips enjoin
ed to appreherd and secure me ; and when
I come to be arrefled under this fictitious
representative of legal process, such is its
folly, that even a police magistrate hesitates
to give it force and validity :
The creatures of power and corruption
Hy, and are afraid or alhamed- to support
their creators ! the proclamation having
thus loll; its King, the warrant of the com
mons is again tried, Slid under its authori
ty I am dragged to their bar, and from
thence by ..â eir order to Newgate.
Having given this brief flatement, it 15
only necefl'ary to add a few observations :
It appears, tljat among the rights compre
hended in the privilege of free debate in the
Irish House of Commons,is that of mreflram
ed Billing/gate again!! every citizen who op
pores or exposes, the profligacy of a cor
rupt court. â 1 he dignity of parliamenta
ry proceeding, and the correct delicacy of
(enatorial language, are delerted by admi
niffration for puerile petulance, the low a
buse of an illiterate dsbatinÂ£fociety. The
citizen who dares to think or speak, mull
be run down "as bankrupt in charafterand
fortune, ' and then perhaps his person * be
comes the butt of the meanness of unmanly
ridicule. I his is, surely a noble and gener% i
privilege to exercise ! yet woe to him who
has spirit to resent or refill it !âAdmini
(tration holding the majority of Parliamenl
by the beard through corruption, become
at once his judges and persecutors ; auc :
then warrants, sergeant at arms, and pro
clamations, hunt him to the very sea ports
of the Illand.
TSvery man acquainted' with parliamen
tary hiltory knows that the privileges of
the commons were originally permitted
and exercised, in opposition to the crown,
for the benefit and protection of the peo

A few clays since arrived at Wilmingtor
from Belfalf, in Ireland, a ship with up
wards of four hundred paflengers, wh
have come to feyle 111 the United States.
The Englifti have lately re-inforcedthei
strength at Jamaica with several addition
al ships of war on that station, as well i
/hips from England. Two regiments ar
also ordered there from Halifax. Thi
seems to have given the Frdfcch at Hifpa
niola many uneasy apprehensions, fuppo
ling themselves, in their present weak state
to be the probable object of attack. I
conference preparations the go
vernor of French Hifpaniola has given or
dels to put the sea coast in the bell state o
defence poflible ; and a line of signals ar
eltablifhed quite Mown from the Gape t
Nicola, Mole. Orders are fakl. to hav
been received in Jamaica from Englam
not to Inpply the French at St. Doming'
with provilions of any kind.
The people of Savanna, in Georgia
were lately much duped by an impostor
who had advertised to exhibit many ex
traordinary feats of aflivity. After wait
ing an hour and an half for the rising o
the curtain, the audience had the mortifi
cation to find the wonder-monger and hi
associates, his dancing horse, his fpeakim
pigs, his .whittling pigeons, &c. &c. all flee
with a very coniiderable sum of mone
that he hadcolleited from the unfufpeftin:
citizens.
The following paragraph, copied fron
an Irish paper, affords the cleared inform
ation we have yet seen about the arrest o
Mr. 1 andy.âlt appears he never submit
ted to any process until a judiciary one is
sued â¢ â
u On Saturday last, 21ft April, a war
rant was issued from the court of king
bench, for apprehendiug James Nappei
1 andy, Eftj. inforrmtion on oath havin;
been*driven before the honorable juftic<
Hewit, that Mr. Tandy had written letter
to Mr. f oler, with intention of promrf
ting a duel, and committing a breach o
the peace ; and on Monday Mr. Tand;
waited on Mr. Justice Hewit, accompani
ed by Hugh Crothers and Henry Jackson
esquires, to give bail; and were bound ii
one recognizance in the penalty of 200!
that Mr. Tandy fhoukl attend the court o
kings bench from day to day, to anfwei
such charges as maÂ«y be brought againl
him ; and also in another recognizance o
the fame penalty, that Mr. TandylhouU
keep the peace with all his majesty's fub
jefts, and in particular with John Toler.
Elq. Ihe cafe of Mr. Tandy, as we un*
derftand he intends to bring foms late
tranfaftions relative to himfelf before the
tribunal of the courts of law, will mate
rially interest the public attention, both
as involving a question as to the extent of
parliamentary privileges, and as to thefe
curity of the fubjeÂ£t from undefined, and
thetefore unknown authority: however
moderate the exercise of power, it mull
always be deiirable to have its boundaries
ascertained ; and however temperate the
authoritative claims of any branch of the
legillature, it must ever be eligible to have
thcÂ«t defined."
We are further informed by a gentle
man who was in Dublin during the whole
ot these tranfaftions, that the words used
by T oler (who in private to be a
friend of Mr. ; Tandy's, but in tlje house
of commons made u(e of this
ible and probably falfeexpreffion) were,â
that he was bankrupt both in character
and fortune. ' âMr. Tandy, hi consequence
demanded an explanation, and fait! if it
was refufed he would have recourse to
the public papers ; in other words, that he
would publifli Toler as a coward. âThe
wretched servant of the crown took fhfel
ter under his privilege, and engaged the
whole parliament to resent his pitiful cafe.
The ferjeant at arms was dispatched to ar
rest Mr. 7 andy, but he would not gratify
the childish malice of the house, to submit
to their officerâand when the filly tool ancl
representative of majesty was so ridiculous
to iflue a jfroclamation to apprehend Mr.
1 andy,_ and when he attended at several
of the city magistrates, in consequence of
the ignorant proclamation, none of thole
city magistrates, nay, not even the caftle
liacts amongst them, would take their
mock-majesties' proclamation for a fuffi
:ient authority to commit Mr. Tandyâso
.hat he was not committed until a warrant
1 flueel from the king's benchâand he was
amy one night in prison, to which place he
was attended by upwards of 6000 citizens,
who were joined by many thoufandsin the
evening, and, Bad it not been for the feli
citations of Mr. Tandy and his foil, there
would have been a rnoft dreadful scene of
blood filed, for the citizens wer? well in
clined to destroy the prison that night and
every house belonging to the government
junto.âThe moderation and good sense of
Tandy prevented this dreadful catastro
phe ; and we hear that it is expefled he
will be able to humble thole members of
the house of commons who had forgot that
they were the servants of the people, and

ThejWfefts which have been generated
within To short a time, in the members of
the national government of the United
by the management of a great pub
lic dlbt, is an irrefiftable demonstration of
the'baneful influence of public debtjt on
public virtue : and it may be numbered
among the many striking indications of the
penetrating mind of our chief magistrate,
that in the midst of the fafhionable fallacie;
on that fubjeft, his speeches to Congref
have uniformly recommended and prefled
a vigorous attention to the means of rid
ding his country of so great an evil.
Itis a hopeful sign of political reforma
tion, When the known abettors of hereditary gov
ernment and orders of nobiljty are represented
by their humble Servants in the public pa

the.true principles of the revolution and
republicanism. The world, (the Ameri
can world, at least) has been much deceiv
ed, if there has not been in several" instances a
deviation from certain principles, a lemblance
of which were neceifary in dark hours for
purpofesnot difficult to be guessed at. âIf
the conversion of fucli characters be sincere
(which shall be judged by their works) con

From the Knoxville Gazette May 3
On the ,sth of April, as a Cherokee, with
four squaws, was passing peaceably, near
the house of James Hubbard, on French
Broad, he had two gun's discharged at him.
One ball grazed his cheek ; the other pas
sed through his fide, giving him a flight
wound. This Hubbard is one of thole peo
ple who went down the Tenefee laftfpriug
to attempt a settlement 011 the Muscle'
Shoals ; and there are ftrofig reasons to
suspect that the guns were fired by his two ;
foils, -minors who live with him. By the
Indians helscalled the Fool Warrior, from
the Similarity of his character to that of an:
Indian fellow, thus distinguished by his
killing people in time of peace, and decli

quainted with the frontier settlers, that
such conduct meets their approbation, it is
thought neceflary to observe, that it is by
them generally hel Ift abhorrence*. They
are perfectly pitafed with the ate treaty
ofHolfton, and are determined to pielerve
it inviolare 011 their part, firmly relying <
that, in so doing, they will ever receive the
support and protection of government
On the fifth day of April last, a party of
Indians, fuppoled to be Cherokee,s, stole a
number of horses from Cox's station, and
the neighbourhood thereof, in Powel's val
ley, Virginia.âThey took the Kentucky
trace, thro* Cumberland mquntain to V el -
low Creek, to which place they were fol
lowed by two men, who returned without
overtaking them. Col- Cox then set out
with 9 party of men down Powel's valley
to a gap in Cumberland mountain, where
he wa per/uaded they mull: pass in recrof
fing the mountain to reach their' towns, if
Cherqkees. 011 liÂ« way down, about 2
o'clock in the morning of the 6th, near the
Indian old towns, and thl*land known by
Henderfons survey, he fell in with an In
dian camp, he fired on, and killed a
Cherokee chief, calle-d Hoolaqah ; or, the
Big Acorn, and wounded two others, who
made their elcapeâAmong the articles
found in their camp were a number of hal
ters, fonie childrens apparel, and some cot
ton in quills.
The Kentucky Gazette, of the 12th of
May, contains the following information,
viz. A prisoner that was taken by the Indi
ans the week before lalt, has made his
elcape. He informs that he was taken by
fiCfcen Indians, and kept several days in the
settlement, during which time the Indians
obliged him to call families out of their
houses, while they lay in ambush, to mur
der them whenever they should appear ;
happily it had not the intended effectâpart
-of the Indians were Delawares and the ba
lance Shawanefe they told him they
did not intend taking prisoners, except ne
groes, which they could fell at Detroit for
two kegs of tatfey, and wilhed him to con
duct them to where they could get negroes;
but informed them he knew of no place
where there were negroes, but what was
also strongly defended with white men â
they informed him that a number of their
men were encamped near the Ohio, on the
other fide : When they got near the Ohio
they (hewed signs of fear, the Ken
tuckians, had gone forward to the Ohio
to intercept them, and (top a few miles on
this lide to wait till night and cross before

MANOR BILL.
An Attempt is making in Ireland to efl:a
blilh Ma nor-Laws, for the benefit of the I
poor, and for the more convenient judgjpg
of petty suits at law. At present, in that
country, upon everfofinall a fuit,the plain
till' is obliged to go to the aflize court. â
The object of the bill is, that all suits un
der 40s. lhall be tried within the manor â
The observations of the Archbishop of
Caifiel on this occalion afford a linking
view of the difficulties a poor fellow la
bours under on these occasions,
"I will suppose (fays he) that a sum of
five (hillings is disputed for by two neigh
bours. It becomes necessary to resort to
a distant town where the assizes are held,
to fettle the dffpute as to the- property oi
the five (hillings : there are several days
spent in preparations for the journey.â
The suitor, after the loss of a week's time
in preparing for and performing the jour
ney, arrives in the aflize town, where he
finds (after long and difficult fearcl\) an ho
nefl attorney, ; who, notwithstanding his
integrity, knows full well the value of his
timeâand the suitor is obliged to pay him
certain fix end eight fences f<}r his trou
ble. The attorney, who at firft saw a
very clear cafe, now discovers some lit
tle difficulty ; which, to overcome, it is
neceflary to have the aid of a lawyer ;
and, fortunately for the client, the attor
ney can recommend him to a very honest
and able gentleman in that profeflion ; two
guineas are, however, an indispensable pass
port to his acquaintance. Every previous
Hep to a trial is at length takenâwhen the
judge, to have a prodigious deal
ofheavybufinefson hand,is obliged to lay a
side suits of less weight,among which is that
of the suitor in queition, who after a loss of
many days,and fix or seven pounds, returns
home to wait for fix months more, when,
perhaps the fame occurrence again involves
the fame expences, with the fame success.
On his return he meets a friend, and they
repair to a whiskey shop ; there the consti
tution of Ireland is the fubjeft of discourse ;
and its perfection, no doubt, the theme of
his. friend's praile : in its commendation
however our suitor is not willing to join.
! don't (fays he) pretend to judge of the theory of
the conjhtution, but as to the executive fart of it, I
declare I havt no cause to celebrate it, and I'll tell
youaflory tojuftifyny ajfertion." He accor
dingly relate, his calamitous attempt to re
cover five (hillings ! âNow, my lords, were
the cause to be decided in a manor court

On the present slate of the poor in England.
VERY few poor labourers, See. can now
spare so much money from their fcauty
weekly earnings, as to buy a little malt ;
iwnfequently their general liquor, in their
1 families, is water ; or. if nature sometimes
craves and is indulged with fomthtng stron
ger.by luchas labour hard, it is purchased
at a dear rate from or at public houses.
It was formerly the common custom of the
of labourers and artificers toyurchafe
on market days, t\vo or gallons of
malt, wh.ch would'perhaps brew tolerable
good table beer for the week ; but the in
creased duty, and the advanced price of
barley, now generally render this imprac
ticable. Here it may be acknowledged,
that there is tap much occalion for a re
mark, that their poverty,
many of thelabourers,&c. spend mucli of
their timeand money in public houses ; but
admitting that "the wicked will do wick
â¢' edly," and add, "drunkenness to their
thirst," of strong liquors, although their
fanmies may be in,, a starving condition ;
is that a reason againfl the wants and mise
ries of the industrious virtuous poor being
deeply pondered, and A'ery proper rational
effort made to alleviate their tliftrefiesf
The labouring man who now wants a mu"
of malt liquor, has this excuse for
to drink it in a public-house, ' I cannot af
ford to keep it for my family, and- if I
'â¢ drink it at home it is very painful to me
41 to with-hold a flwre of it from my wife,'
&c. and thus perhaps many more are intro
duced to fitting in public houses, and be
come more habituated to drinking, than
would be the cafc, could they have beer of
a middling strength in their own. But to
return to my fubjeit.
Except in counties where it is very poor,
and therefore fold at .a low price, cheese
can now scarcely be tailed by the poor, al
though it was a principle article of their
food within the time I have tQgntioned.
} At tins period, wheat was from three
(hillings to three killings and pence - '
barley, eighteen pence to two and twenty'-
some lower than either ; malt, twofhillingS
and fix pence. I have known gbod new
milk cheese bought from r 2 to 14s. per cwt
and it was commonly fold in the hucksters
hops for seven farthings or two pence per
lb.; now .t is more than double, and forte
forts more than treble that price, retail.
Butchers meat upon an average, is nearly,
(if not quite) doublets former price ; the
!*>or may look at it and figl, f or it in the
markets, but very little of it mult fall to
the iharff ofmany of thfm. I know what
I fay, when I assert.that iinlefs it be given
them,fome and I fear man;, do not taste a
moriel of butcher's meat for many months;
yet these are the poor of rich Kngland ! In
what other nation lhall we find more mise
rable ? %
tf the poor are considered as the feet of
a nation, (qpportjng its weight, every wife
government will attend minutely to their
t-afe and support, confidently with the ilate
wherein providence has placed them ; and,
while by lahitary laws, well executed, it
re I trains them from, or punishes them for,
vice in its varied forms, wilf endeavour al
so that they lhall be placed<in a capacity to
lupply their own wants. In whatever
Hate this found policy is wanting, it mult be
.tuowed to be alio deficient in wisdom and
hurrfuuty, as well as in chriftiani'ty. This
unexpected remark naturally leads to some
others which I am about to make, refpec
tir.g the causes of the high prices of provi
lions, and I wijh it may make way for their
cordial reception.
t Perhaps it would notkamifs to colder toht
j therthe firefent high duty on malt for home use, be
not both oppiejjive and impohtich. Opfireffive it
certainly is to tb.owfo heavy a tax on the boulders
oj thelabouringpoor; andit seems equallympo
htick to aaopt anyfyflem o ffinance uhichtends in
its deration, as this unqvefhonably does, to decrease
the quantity of labour, by driving the men to the
ale house, and of cowje to lejen the export of our
own mannfoÃures.

\'^^^ r ELLâstrange it is that fools will still ap-
Vrhings to themselves, that authors never meant;
Sach country shop-man a(ks me, " Is it I
<J\iuhcm your r hinting ridicule is [pent ?
Friends, hold your tonguesâSuch myriads of
your race
Adorn Columbia's fertile, favour'd dimes ,
A man might rove seven years from place to place
Ere he would find the of my rhymesâ-
Perhaps in Georgia is this creature kn^vn,
Perhaps Rhode-lfland claims him for her own :
And if from fancy's world this wight I drew,
What is the imagin'd character to you ?
NOW, from all parts the rural people ran
With ready cafli to buy what migljfbe bought ;
One went to chufe a pot, and one a pan,
And they that had no caih their produce brought,
A hog, a calf, fafe halter'd bf the neck,
Potatoes (Ireland's glory) many a peck J
Eacon and cheese, of real value more
Than India's gems, or all Potofi's or#.
t
Some questions afk'd, the folks began to stare- â
Ns foul wou'd purchase pipe, nor pot, nor pan ;
Each fhookJhis hsad---hung backâyear goods so

Â«' Rum ne'er shall meet my lips ("said honed Sam)
" In fhapc of toddy, punch, grog, fling, or
â¢< No cash of mine you'll get (said pouting Kit?)
" While gauze is valued at so dear a rate."
Thus things dragg'd on for many a tedious day,
No custom came, and nought but discontent
Gloom'd through the fliop " Well let them
have their -way,
(The merchant laid) Li!fell at cent per cent;
By which 1 fearce myfelf fhallfave,

" In cealeiefs streams (hall flow the infpiringrum,
"Till every foul in pleasing dreams is funkâ

Soon were the fltelves dilburthen'd of their load ;
In three lhort hours the keg of wine ran dryâÂ»
Swift from its source even dull molafles flow'dâ
Each saw the rum-calk wafting with a sigh : â

On the probability of the moon being inhabited.
A Mulberry leaf is a little world, inhabited
'frequently by a multitude of invisible worms,
which to them is a country of vast extent. What
mountains, what abysses there are in it i, the
infects on one fide of this leaf know no more of
their fellow creatures on the other, than you and
I can tell what they ate now doing at tlie Anti
podes : Does iyiot appear reasonable, therefore,
that this great pianet, the moon, fliould be inha
biteetfâln the hardest ftcnes, (in marble for in
' fiance) there are an infinity of worme which fill
up the vacuums, and feed upon the substance of
the stone ; fancy, then, millions of living crea
tures to subsist many years on a gfain of sand ;
so that were the moon but one continued rock,
1 would'fooner allow her to be gn.vye i by these
invilible mites, than not to be habited. In
short, every thing is animated ; imagine then
those animals which are jet undiscovered, and
add them and these which are but lately disco
vered, to what we have always seen, and you
will find the earih swarm with inhabitants, and
that nature has so liberally furnifhed it with ani
mals, that she is not at all concerned for our not
feeing above one half or them : Why then ihould
nature, which is fruitful to an excess here, be so
very sterile in the moon and other planets as, in
the opinion ol some, to produce qo living things
In them ?
All human faces, in general, are of the fame
model ; and yet the Europeans aad Africans
have two particular moulds ; nay, commonly,
every family has a different afpeft ; what secret
then has nature to shew so much variety in the
single face ? Our world, in refpefl of the uni>
verse, is but a little family, wherein every face
has some resemblance to cach other ; in another
planet is another family, whose faces have a dif
ferent air and make : the difference, too, en
creases with the diftanc, for whosoever should
fee an inhabitant of the moon and an inhabitant
of the earth would soon perceive they were nearer
neighbours than one of the earth, and one of Sa
turn : here, frfr example, we have the use of
voice ; in another world they speak by signs ;
and at a greater distance they do not, perhaps,
speak at all ; here our reason is formed by ex
perience j in the r.ext world experience contri
butes but little towards reason j add in the next
to that, old men know no more than children.
Here we are troubled more with what is to come,
than with what is past. In the next world they
are more troubled for what is past than what is to
come ; and farther off they are not concerned
with either, which by the bye, I think is much
the better : here, it is thought, we want a sixth
sense, that would teach us many things, of which
we are now ignorant ; this sixth sense is appa
rently in another world, where they want one of
the five which we enjoy ; nay, perhaps, ihere is
a much gieater number of senses, but ia the par
tit*on we have made of them with the inhabi
tants of the other planets, there are but /all
en to our fliare, with which we are well content
ed, for want of being acquainted with the reft :
Our sciences have bounds which the wit of man
could never pass j there is a point where the)
fail us on a fuddenj the reft is reserved for other
worlds, where somewhat which ive know is un
known to them. This planet (the earthy enjoys
the pleasures of k>ve, but lies desolate in several
places by the fury of war 5 in another planet they
enjoy perpetual peace, yet in the midst of that
Wace, know rfot any thing of love, and time lies
heavy on their hands. In jpwofd, that which
nature pradtifes here in little, irt distributing her
gifts among mankind, she large in other
worlds, where /he makes use of that admirable
fccret {he has to diversify all things, and at the
fame time makes them equal, by compensating
for the inequality. . \Fonttnelle.\
On the AGE of MAN. v
WHEN the constitution of the body is found,
it ppflible perhaps, by moderation in the po
tions, temperance and sobriety, to lengthen out
the period of life for a few years. But even of
[his there seems to be an uncertainty ; lor, if n
is neceflarv that the l>ody fhonlH employ its whole
Strength, that it (hould consume whatever it is
:apable of consuming, that it should undergo
; veiy pollible exercise, whence could any benefit
accrue from regimen and from abstinence ? Men
no doubt there are who have furpafi'ed the usual
period of human existence, an apple will now
and then be found hanging on a tree the latter
snd of November, long after the.others are dis
appeared and rotten. Not to mention Parry tae
englishman, who liv'd to the age of one hun
dred and forty four, and Jenkins, to that of one
hundred and fixty-five, as recorded in the philo
sophical tranfaftions ; we have many usance*
of the prolongation of life to one hundred anti
ten, and even to one hundred and twenty years.
Yet this longevity was occasioned by no peculiar
art or nvnagement. On the contrary, it ap
pears, that the generality ot such long livers were
peasants accustomed to the greatelt fatigues j
huntsmen, or labourers 5 men, in faÂ£t, who had
â¢mployed theif whole bodily strength, and even
abused it, if to abuse it is pollible, otherwiie
than by continual idleness and debauchery.
If fn the duration of lite there is any difference
to be found, it ought fecmingly to be ascribed to
the quality of the air. In elevated situations, it
has been obferved,there are commonly found more
old people than in such as are low. In general,
however, the period, of human existence may be
said to be the fame Iti every country. If not cot
offby accidental diseases, mankind [in Europe] is
found to live to the years of ninety or an hun
dred* Beyond that age the rac%)f man has in
never lived. 1
From a careful infpe&ion of the Registers of
burials in a certain number of country parishes in
France, compared with the mortality of Paris,
:he following table has been made out, of the pro
bable duration of human life.

Dean Swift's CANDID CONFESSION.
v DEAN SWIFT, who is well known
peen the principal champion of monarchy during
the greater part of his life, was, in the latter
part of it, compelled by his own experience to
change his mind, and Jive his teftimcny in favor
of republics'. Having, used some exprefiions in
The Pre/byter;atis y Plea of Merit," written in
| 31, whicn might seem to reflect on republican
governments, he obviates such a conftrudtion by
the following words : " I do not fay this in di
minution or difgracc to commonwealths, wherein I
cdnfefs I have much altered many opinions under
which I was educated, having been led by some
observation, long experience, and a thorough de
testation of the corruptions of mankind: insomuch
that I am now justly liable to the censure of Hobbs
who complains that'the youth of England imbibe
ill opinions from reading the histories of ancient
Greece and Rome, those renowned scenes of li
berty and every virtue."
Such a confeffion, extorted by experience and
observation from a man no less di/tinguiihed for
his knowledge of the world than his profound ge
nius, in contradiction to the prejndices of edu
cation, the piide of former opinions committed
to the public In various Works of his pcnÂ» ob
an uccadon where his religious animosities and
personal interest conspired with other motives to
favour his original impressions, is a severe satire
against the corruptions of kingly government, and
ought rÂ» be an antidote to all
tendL to p&l'on the republican chara&er ana oon
