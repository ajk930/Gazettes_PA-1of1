S 1 R,
THE peculiar situation of F.nlign
Morgan, of the tfl United States Regi
ment, having excited many enquiries, you
are requested to publish ia your paper,
without any comment thereon, the fol
lowing extract of a letter, from him, dated
at Charleston, S. CÂ» November lit 1792.
" T AM equally fatisfied with you, my
-*â  friend, that the Prelident of the
United States has no with to alfume arbi
trary or despotic au'thortty; but as you
think with me that the Secretary at War
has done fa, by ordering me to Fort
Wafliington (900 miles) for trial, at a
time when the pretext was unfounded in
truth, and when my accuser was to re
main, and has remained ever since in
Philadelphia, or in such parts of Pennsylva
nia as his pleasure or his inclination led,
I confefs myfell" at a loss for the motives
either in point of policy, honor, or juflice.
Moreover, the evidences which I called on
the Secretary at War for, have been dis
persed over the continent, as though de
iignedly to render it impossible for ine to
derive advantage from any. Major Gai
ther, for inltance, a moll important evi
dence, is sent to command among the
Creek Indians, where his testimony is to
be buried; for by the icth article of the
appendix to the rules and articles of war,
no teftiinony of an officer in the army can
be admitted but filch as shall be delivered
in pei fin before the Court Martial:
now, my dear Sir, how can I procure such
testimony at Fort Washington, when the
Secrctarv at War has, delignedlv or tin
defignedly, scattered throughout the coiiti
nent, the officers whose evidence I cailed
upon him for lalt March or April ? And
liri one of whom ha< been at Fort Wafti
ington'fmce my being ordered there for
trial; but all have been at Philadelphia,
or near it, where I have in vain solicited
to be tried 1
Tile 16th Article of the fame appendix
ordains and directs, that no officer (hall
be detained in arrest longer than 8 cbys
without a trial, or longer than a Court
Martial can be convened: and the ill
article of the fame appendix declares, that
live commiffioiied officers lhall be fufficient
to conflitute a general court martial :
Yet I have been injuriously held in arrelt
two hundred & fifty days, * and upwards,
â when there has scarcely been a day, since
the date of my arrest, that double that
number might not have been assembled at
Philadelphia ; and frequently four time;
the number lieceffary, within a small
distance, doing little, and fonie 110 duty.
You know my friend, that I have in vain
made application to obtain a trial, even
at Pittlburgh, the head quarters of the
army, and that it has been rcfufed me.
On the 19th or 20th of September, I
found a. general Court Martial setting al
Philadelphia-; whereupon I prefentec
mvfelf immediately in person at the Wai
Office, to infill upon my trial before thai
court: but my application was rejected
YOll have seen my correspondence witi
the Secretary in co:ifeqnence. It is theft
circumstances, my friend, I call fymptovu
Â»f tyranny and dcjptrtifm : lor what i
tyranny or despotism but a difcretionarj
use of power, without being legally amen
able. for the just exercise of it? How
degrading will the situation of gentlemen
in the army be," it a Secretary at War,
a Commander in Chief, or a Prelident.
can at his diftvetion dispense with 01
evade the "articles of war, when inclined
to oppress an individual in it. It t.i
Secretary or Prelident, at his discretion
has a right to order me for trial from
Philadelphia (where my accuser and
evidences are, or may be ealily collected)
to Fort Wafliington, where neither my
accuser nor evidences are, lie will have ar.
equal riffht, to order my brother officer
in like situation to thelake of the woods !
Thi'my dear Sir, is not my cause alons :
It is the cause of the army and the nation,
-wiiich I am refol'ved rather to fuffer in.
than betray.
My business here was to obtain a renew
al of Major Gaither's very important
testimony ; the original whereof I lent tc
Major Butler, who tranfmittea it in lall
May or June to Mr. Brown, Editor ol
the Federal Gazette, for publication, ir
whose office it was mislaid or lofi : I wa
in expectation of overtaking major Gaithet
liere,butlie is gone on to the Creek Nation

hinf, go to him there, or return witlvnt
his tellimony. Thus you fee me involved
i:i expences 1 which have in a few momii
amounted, and will amount to feveial
years, pay of an Enlign !
When I firft entered on this bufiucfs
last February, my sole object was to
juflify the honor and reputation of r.iy
deceased friend General Bur ler : A4d
having done it to the latisfaction of l;h

To ALEXANDER HAMILTON, Secre
tary of the Treasury of the United
Staces.
S I R,
nOLD and unfounded allertion will
*â¢ not pass current although it proceed
from a Secretary of the Treasury : when
:herefore, in your letter to the House of
Iteprefentatives of the 4th of this mouth,
low befoie the public, in answer to cer
tain resolutions brought forward by a
virtuous and independent member from
Virginia (Air. G les) you undertook deli
berately to declare in the face of the
world, " th t uutill those resolutions, no
11 call had been made upon you, which
â ' rendered.itproper to exhibit a general
" view of the public monies and fundsâ
â ' or to (hew the amount and fitua'ioit
" of fitch as were unapplied.' I '' âWhere
then I a(k, was the conscious blush of
public integrity, which even the immaculate
mind of a Catullus might display ? Had
Mr. Jefferfon hazarded such an a'ffertlon
in the face of so many opposing aud fhili
born facts as I (hall here prel'ent to the
public, he would have been, as indeed he
ought, eonfigued to that merited infa
my and contempt, which, on another
occasion, the virtuous Catullus, without
a shadow of cause, fought to place him
under. But I forbear to recriminate ;
Catullus is fully competent to make or to
take an inference.
Attracted from all other confederations,
and svithout yielding to the force of an
inlinuation, as insulting to the legislature
of the United States as it is derogatory to
their honor, but which inevitably results
from the afTertioi) in your letter, will it
be believed by the public that during four
years of your liscal admi nitration, 110 call
hid before been made upon you, no
solitary occasion afforded, in which, if
merely emanating from a sense of clut
only, it could hive been " rend-:: a
proper to exhibit a general view o'" the
public monies and funds, or to li e.* the
amounfand situation of fm.li as were un
applied ?
I will not however, expos yam* aller
tion, only from its unguarded latitude of
cxpreCion ; want of recollection, it a
Secretary of the Treasury will stoop to
the apology, might be pleaded perhaps
against that express and poi ited demand
contained in the refolirion of the House
of Representatives of the 19th January
1-92, in which you were called upon
" to exhibit such a view of the public
finances as would enable the LegUlature
to judge whether any and what additional
supplies were requisite for the service of
the current year."âNeither fliall I now
animadvert upon the very faithful and
ascurate, flatement, which
you then exhibited, ball memg the public
revenue; to the end of the year 1792,
within a few thousand dollarsâUtlio' now
when you profefs to (hew a real and not a
conjellural flatemeutof the fame revenues
to the end of the fame year, you present
to public view an excefi of income beyond
the expenditure, to the enormous amount
of 5, r 16,897 dollarsâWide difference,
indeed, for a financier; the caufe&of which
(hall be fully explained hereafter. I will
only now hint that further aflumption of
debts was then 011 the tapis.
My present purpose is, to recall your
recollecti m to what lias pafi'ed during the
present feflion, and uotwithftanding thai
treachery of memory with which you are
afflicted," to compel you, by a fair recur
rence to fhibborn fails, to acknowledge
your allertion, as above stated, to be
utterly unfounded, and to throw yourfelf,
as or. a late occasion in another place up
on tKe candour -and (orgivenefs <>( tllofe
whom so rafii an allertion was addrefied.
The faÂ£ts to which I {hill refer, are
prefentcd i.i the trite form of queries,
that yourfelf or your friends may the bet
ter a'iftver them.
" Did you not on the 14th day of No
vember lift, report to Congress an_efti
inate of 1,500,000 dollars and upwards as
necelfary for the current service of the
year 1793 ?"
" Did you not, in that report, state to
Gongrefs the ways and means for railing
that money, and by way of explanation
refer them to a comparative flatement of
revenue to the end of the year 1793,
marked D, without bringing into the
\ ie\v of the Legillature any part of the
s ery large luni of 2.504,76; dollars, which
j you had. at that time, aÂ£hl-illy drawn
! over from Europe out of the monies arif-
I ing from foreign loans, and of which
! monies two funis to wit, 605,883 dollars,
lii cents, iocafh, and ;Ke filni of 611,593
ioM-irs for proceeds of bills (which yon
lince acknowledge, began to be received
iii October last) were then deposited in
the ba.ik.?"
â¢' Did you not. under the fame circum
stances, report to Congress 011 the 30th of
November lalt, a p'an for the redemption
of the public it bi, propoling therein a fyf
ftein of loans predicated 011 the idea of fur
ther immediate and permanent taxes,
without bringing into view of the legisla
ture one Ihilli;;;; of the money ariiing from
'â¢jreign loans ?
" Did not Congress, at their present fef
[ion, direst you to report the ways and
meaiii to re-imburfe of two millions
of dollars obtained by the President of the
bank of the United States on account of
the public's fubfeription of lhares in the
bank ?"
'â¢ Did you not on the 30th of November
tad, report your opinion to Congress " that
power be given by law to borrow the said
two millions of dollars"âwithout inforin
iijg the 111 that there was then in bank up
wards of 1,300,000 dollars of the monies
ariiing from foreigu loans, at the disposal
of government
" Were, or were not, any of the fore
going occalions to be regarded as so many
calls upon you, or as affording one oppor
tunity, " which rendered it proper to ex
hibit ageneral view of the public monies
aucf fundiâor to (hew the amount and
situation <>f such as were unapplied ?"
But I turn, with disgust, from a view of
the subject so insultingly derogatory to
common sense. Let the convictions of your
c.vn mind supply the answers.
One thing is manifeft, that at the dates
of all the preceding circuin(lances, it might
01 be expedient to bring into the view of
thelegifl I'ture the situation of the 2,304,769
dollars drawn over from Europe: until
the 3d of January last, you refilled the in
fluence of any preceding calls, which under
the .strong circamftances I have stated,
ought to have produced a voluntary disclo
sure oi'it; and then only, in obedience to
apofitiv; and Jpecinl call for that purpose,
reported a flatement of the foreign loans
the 1110 ft ambiguous and evasive, that ever
disgraced the ability and talents of a man,
ambitious of the character of a faithful fi
nancier. When called upon, too,for further
explanations, in consequence of the reso
lutions moved by Mr. Giles, your letter of
the 4th instant is produced in r.nfwer,
teeming with all the peevilh petulance of
in angry man, and containing little eva
fioiis of the inform tion asked for, by tic
mean? indicative of that anxious desire to
meet the fubjeft With decision and explicit
ftefs, so emphatically declared in the be
ginning of the letter. Quixote like, to raise
a windmill that you may attack and de
stroy it, is very amusing. To account for
unaccounted millions, when not asked to
do it, thro' the means of that wizzard's
wand, CONJECTURAL STATEMENTS, is
one thing: But to account for unaccounted
millions, when required so to do, and that
too, thro' the means of plain, simple direct,
and real statements, is quite another thing.
In doing the firft, you are prompt and
dexterous beyond measure. In doing the
last, firangsly dilatory, ignorant, andun
fkilful. Whence this extreme disparity of
talents.as applicable to the one or the other
cafe ?âCan it be poflible. that the plea now
so industriously circulated by your friends,
of incapacity to slate Jatisfatiorily public
accounts, is well founded ? Or is there 110
man allbciated with you in the department
of which you are the head, competent to
the talk? Strange situation, truly, in which
to place the United States. Pofiefied of a
,financier, with the mofl fertile imagination
[Total No. 137.]
and {kill in all that relates to systems of per
manent and irredeemable debt, permanent
taxes, permanent loans, the distribution,
expenditure, and applicability of public
monies, who for four years past has pos
sessed unlimited confidence and- exercised
unlimited controul over 14 millions of dol
lars of the public money, and who, whe;*
called upo.i to render a fair and true ac
count for about two millions of that mo
ney, mull submit to the mortifying infinti
ations, propagated by his friends, of uttir
incapacity so to do !
Mvfterious as this appearance is, perhaps
the following brief review of fails, pre
sented from your own letters, (latements,
and explanations, may furnilh the folutiou
of it.
You began to draw bills on account of
the 2,304,769 dollars of foreign loan- :
brnught into the United States 011 the 15th
of December, 1 790, and continued drawing
until the 28th of Decern. 1 792, two months
after the prcfent session of Congress com
menced. You employed, as you fay, tlie
refpeflive banks to be the agents in thefales
of those bills. The bills were drawn by
the treasurer of the United States, in fa
vour of the respective calhiers of the banks,
at what fight is r.ct mentioned, and in sumS
of florin; of, from ioo.oco and less, to one
million and more. The bills so drawn,
were again reduced into smaller bills, by
the banks that disposed of them, for the
convenience of purchasers, and fold at dif
ferent rates of exchange & different terms
of credit. But the precise nature and ef
fect of this twofold operation you have not
thought fit to explain. Whether the re
fpeftive banks obtained an immediate or
eventual credit, and when, with the com
mifiioners in Holland ? Whether the re
fpe&ive banks became debtors to die public
from the time of such credit in Holland,
or merely from the refpeftive dates, when
the proceeds of the (ales made by them,
came into bank? or from what other date,
they became so debtor, does not appear.
Who drew the bills disposed of by the
banks j when the bills drawn in favour of
the banks were paid in Hollandâand when
the bills.draivU by the banks,were paid for
here, are also not exhibited. Whether the
banks whom you represent merely as the
agents of the public jn the sale of the bills,
derived any and what advantage or emolu
ment from the manner of negotiating them,
is a circumstance which they and you arc
equally bound fairly and explicitly to state,
not by vague allertion, but by a full, pre
cise, and circumllantial detail ol all the
particulars ofthis very curious and, to the
public, deeply intrrefting business.
It is not my present purpose to pursue
you thro'' all those wanderings of tlie ima
gination, to which the public are led, by the
further defence or apology contained in
your letter of the 13th of this month. Ch.t
of this apology, two questions arife,equally
awefnl and important for you toanl'wer.â '
FirJ?, Whether you had, or ever possessed,
any fufneient authority to divert two mil
lions of public money from its express ap
propriation by law, and hold it, or any part
ofit,(as you express it )applicah!elo another
purpofe?âand, Secondly, Whether ) .hi
can now account for the w hole of this mo
ney, not only by (hewing where it actual.v
is, but also, the reasons whyabout i,300.cc0
dollars part thereof, has never yet been
paid inro the treasury, but has been ke. t
in a state of abeyance between you r.r d
the banks for periods of from three
to twelve months, or upwards ?
âOn both these questionsÂ« further a 1:i
----madverlions will be offered in my next
letter. It may not be impertinent, how -
ever, here to remark, that no arrogant
affmnption of importance can avail you
in the further progress of this enquiry,
and therefore that all those reprefentat ions
of a supposed discretion as financier of tie
United Statesâof the propriety and re
certify of your having ;:t all times'half a
million of the public money at comma;:-.:,
of those great and comprehensive views
of policy, by which in an efficient ftip

Feb. 18. DECIUS.
For the National Gazette.
Number 11.
THE Public discern the difaffeÂ£Hcn of
the Secretary of the Treasury to the
constitution of the United States, through
the medium of that train of circumflantial
evidence adduced in my last. And yet
the proofs are not exhaulted.
Reader, keep in mind the following po
rtion. A national government was de
signed by the conititntion, which in its ad
niiniftration should consult the will) and
the good of the people.
An adminiftratiou, literally copied from
the monarchical system of Britain, inay
produce a revolution as complete, as it it
had been effeaed by force. If the form
of monarchy was exalted among 11s, a na
tive love of liberty would rally all around
the {tandard of oppolition, except the mi
nions of the idol; 'tis through thouglit
lefl'nefs therefore, and not through pulil
lanimity that wc submit to the fubflauce.
Influence upon the actsofthe legislature,
united with the direction of public money,
concentred in one person, conftitute3 the
e(fence of monarchy. The name ot the
monarch is unimportant. Whether he is
called emperor, king, pope, or secretary
of the treasury, it amounts to the fame
thing. â ,
Two results flow from filch an union.
The laws, are the laws of this individual,
not of the legislature; they only regilter
his aÂ£ls, and the misapplication of public
money will escape with impunity, if the
checks are the creatures of his admini
ftratiou. â , . ,
In the letter of the Secretary of the
Treasury, the following article is to be
found.
" Gash in the bank of
the United States, and the
offices of discount and Dolls. Cts,
depofrt, of New-York and j> 605,883 8
Baltimore, not yet pafed to
the account of the Treasury,
pcrjlatement A. B. J
Up' J.i reading this article, the following
interrogatories naturally occur :
How could this enormout. turn of publu
money find its way into the bank, withoul
palling through the several offices of check:
Is the boalt, " That the excellent orga
nization of the treasury department, inhi
bits every mifapplicalion of public money,'
-well founded ? ... , . ,
In what manner has the public derived a
benefit from depositing this money in the
bank ? ,
And may not the public money have been
facrificed to private interelt orpolitical de
l Â£ This money is a part of 2,304,769 dol
lars 13 cents, borrowed in Holland, and
brought into this country by bills of ex
change, drawn in December 1790, and the
two following years. The Secretary in
his report of January 3d 1 793, slates, thai
017316 dollars, 90 cents, have been, or
are to be applied to the relief of St. Do
mingo and to the payment of foreign offi
cers No part of this sum is pretended to
have been paid previous to February, 1792,
-lltho' nearly a moiety of the bills had been
drawn long before. And it is probable
that about the sum of 473.053 dollars 7
cents, part thereof, is yet unpaid. Howe
ver deduct the whole sum iromthemo
nev'drawn, and there remains 1,387,452
dollars 23 cents. Of this the Secretary
states 605,883 dollars, cents, as being in
the bank, and 636,976 dollars, 73 cents as
due for bills- With regard to this balance,
amounting to 166,976 dollars, 13 cents, it
is hypothecated to the bans of North A
mcrica, as a pledge upon the credit of
which to borrow a fmallerfum.
' This statement isextrafted from there
t'.irfcs, in the mode mo ft favorable for the
officer. It demonltrably proves that
605,885do.'iars, Scents, have been out of
public life from the moment ihev were
drawn, to this dayâ1,567,673 florins,
which nearly amounts to the sum, were
drawn between December 1790 and May
1 -91, if.cliilive. Indeed, the oills for the
greater part were dated in December 1790,
-uiH in January following.
The public have loit the interest upon
the 605,883 dollars, 8 cents for near two
years. For if the bills in some cases carri
ed an interest for a (hort space, and two
years in others have not elapsed (luce the
aioney was received, yet the loss of inter
est on the monies unpaid to St. Domingo
uid the foreign officers, and on the sum of
166,976 dollars, 13 cents, will be an equi
valent to balance those conliderations.
But the questions are not forgotten.â
They are answered thus
This money was placed in the bank by
he unchecked agency of the Secretary oi
:he Treasury.
The organization of the department is
neffectual, or the Secretary has broken the
avr.
The public have derived no benefit fron
his money
It was under the exclusive secret con
:roul and direction of the Secretary, to be
ifed as his interest or policy should die
ate.
For the public it could not have been li
ed, either in anticipations or otherwise
jecaufe it could not pass out, unless it hat
>revioufly passed into the treasury, and ir
his cafe the check offices would have ex
hibited such use.
It is necelfary, before we proceed, tc
mderltand something of the nature oi
hose powers really poffelled by the Secre
ary of the Treasury. He is regardec
>oth by the constitution and the laws as :
langerous officer; and to prevent hin
rom a [fuming functions both legiflativt
uul executive, by a pecuniary power, wif
iom, with particular allidufty, imposes up
in him certain prohibitory injunctions.
The constitution enjoins a periodical ex
libition of public funds, by which it is pre
umed,accounts,fuch as can be understood
liade up of items and figures are meant ;
ind hot volumes of metaphysical reafon
ngs.
The laws, clearly as to taxes, inhibitint
lim from its custody, have provided a trea
urer to receive the money, and several of
ices of check, through which all account
null pass.
As to loans, the President is the chect
>rovided by law. The enormous sum o:
4,000,000 of dollars, may by law be bor
owed and applied, but not by the Secre
ary. It is no censure upon others to ob
erve, that the Prelident was perhaps th(
>nly individual, in whose hands the legif
ature could, with indubitable propriety
lave depolited a trust so important.âMaj
t not be demanded.
Whether the President fanÂ£tified the bor
owing and drawing money hither frorr
Holland, from December 1790 to the pre
"ent year ?
Whether he fanftified the keeping ft
rreat a sum of public money out of publi<
iriew ?
And whether he fanctified the keeping
Congress itfelf in the dark upon the l'ub
ieft, for several felfions ?
These questions may be boldly anfweret
in the negative. The President's nice ho
nor would never fuft'er him to sap a demo
cratical government, which he has engager
to support, by countenancing dark monar
chical manoeuvrings of public money. Ani:
liisintegrity is above commendation.
Several fedions of Congress have elajffec
luce the bill-drawing bnlinefs was adopt
ed, and yet the secret was preserved will
unexampled fidelity, by the Secretary, the
Treasurer, and the Bank-DireÂ£tors, fell
for, as it whs, by at least two resolutions.
But this is denied : " 'till the last refoln
tions" [fays the Secretary] *' no call ha:
3een made, which rendered it proper tr
exhibit a general view of the public mo
lies and funds, Or to shew the amount anii
ituation of such as were unapplied."
On the 30th of December 1791, the
House of Repr,efentatives resolved, that
t fliall be the duty of the Secretary of the
Treasury, to lay before the House of Re
jrefentatives on the 4th Monday of Ofto
jer in each year, an accurate flate
nent and account of the receipti and. ex
penditures of K\A.public monies,isc.
And on the 19th of January 1792, the
"aine house ordered, " that the Secretary
:>f the Treasury be directed to lay before
:he house, such information with respect to
'he finances of the United States as willeÂ«-
able the legijlature to judge -whether any
additional revenue will be necejfafy, in
:onfequence of the proposed increase of the
military eftablilhment."
Pause here for a moment, and scan the
veracity of the aifertion. The firft resolu
tion calls for " the receipts and expendi
tures of all public monies."''' Was it not
then " proper to exhibit a general view oj
all the public monies and funds ?"âNo, fays
the SecretaryâWere these monies,it is ask
ed, public or private ? If the former, they
fall within the very letter of the resolution.
The second resolution demands " Such
information with refpeit to the finances of
the United States, as will enable the lea, ill a
ture to judge, whether any additional re
venue'will be necciiary, &c."
The finances of the United. States, are
comprelfcnfive expreifions, but, fays the
Secretary* no propriety could even from
this order be inferred, why he Ihould
"/hew the amount and fltualion of such
public monies and funds as were unap
plied."
Now considering that Congrefswere re
solving in the dark,as having no knowledge
of this bill-draining bufinejs, if they die
not hit the nail on 'the very head, the Se
cretary's ingenuity might have helped then
to tljeir o'ojeft on the score of the true fpi
iit and intention of the order. If they had
luckily Humbled on unapplied funds, tc
me it would seem, that they would have
found the very thing they were looking
for.
Whenever power is given to him, the Se
cretary is not deficient in the talent of ex
panding the sense, and giving a scope to thi
intention; and if accounts of public fund
a;-e demanded, he is equally clever at whit
tling down the sense to the letter, and tha
he even sometimes obliterates.
Does this mode of administration consul
the will, or the good of the people ?âan<
if not, has not the Secretary fruftrated th(
design of the constitution, in the eftabiilh
ment of a general government ?
If toconceal from the people, and theii
representatives, The nature and extent o]
public resourcesâto incur a loss of inter
est, upon an enormous sum of public mo
ney by a non-user or a mis-liferâto evade
official checks eftablilhed by law and the
:onftitution, âand to retain an uncontroll
ed power over immense funis of money,
which are, to fay the lealt, operating ali
,!>Â« time for the emolument of paper
men and paper institutions.âis theft
:hings produce pleasure or good to the
ieopie, then the Secretary is guided by the
Constitution in his administration ; but ii
"rom these facts, opposite conclulions mill)
: ollow, then it is evidently proved, that he
â¢egards the conflitution with the molt in
veterate difaftection.

Extract of a letter from a refpe&able cha
racter in Virginia
" I am pleased to hear a ftrift scrutiny
will be made into the use and expenditure
of the public money. The fvftem of fi
nance that has been (I cannot but think,
unfortunately c or the republican interest
and general wtifare) adopted in the com
mencement of the present government, is
so involved, and pursued with such refine
ment, and, apparently, contrived intrica
cy, as to conceal its movements and objeth
from common observation, and to be un
derstood only by those who make it their
particular bulir.efs to investigate such sub
jects. Plans of finance, dark and my lie
rious, fiiould not be adopted, for this plair
and good reason, that the people have a
right, and ought to fee and know, how
their money is expendedâthis they cannot
do but by their representatives, and as it i 1
their duty to fully understand and as full)
invefligate the management of the money,
one would think, unless actuated by (imilai
motives, they would always prefer ;
Ample plan, to that which is complicated
less likely to be disordered, and wliei
more easily remedied. The
making free with appropriations is not onlj
a breach of law but a dangerous practice
as it respects the public faith, and canno
bejuftified but irom absolute necefiity, oi
palliated but by the express sanction of th<
executive, the proper judge of the indif
penfible jieceffity. The officer, in fuel
cefe,has 110 right to ast from himfelf. Tilt
reason for using the Dutch loan withoul
the concurrence of the commissioners ne
ceflarily sccalions ftifpicion of itr, propel
application. The eltablilhing the bank
without excluding from a feat in the legif
lature the proprietors of the flock, ha:
sown the feed of corruption, as, betweer
the financier and the dire&ors, the game
may be played to the great emolument oi
the proprietorsandthe undermining of the
independence of the legislature. The pro
fits of the bank, it is said, amounted the lafl
year to 16 per cent: this has doubled the
gain of the firft calculation, and must. I
suppose, be owing to the extent of its dis
counts, and may, it is to be presumed, be
carried much higher in time, so long a;
loans in Europe exist, and the revenues ol
the country are subservient to its gainful
purposes,"

A private letter fro-m Havre mentions,
" th it the greater part of tiie treasures oi

" The contention, and the plots form
ed by the aristocrats, have bred all the
mifchiefs and miseries which the world has
of late witnelled in France. The Frencl
commoners, in one word, all the oppreffec
Frenchmen, were crying for liberty anc
equality ; and had their just demand;
been granted, all dispute was at an end ; all
ibufes would have been gently suppressed.
every thing would have been put right
igain ; the reign of the law once taking
place, every one could have recovered his
own ; kept his own : and nothing but hi;
own. But unfortunately, the human spe
cies ha 6 too much affinity with the brutes.
There are also amongst them wolves and
tygers ; eagles and hawks, living always
at the expence of the weak ; happy by the
misfortunes of others, and inspiring a ge
neral dread to the multitude, either
their frightful how lings, their menacine
appearance, or the Iharpnefs of their
claws. At 1 ast the veil of prejudice has been
torn off ; the many have felt the truth
of what the few had told before ; genuine
philolophy has triumphed Over the charms
that dazzled their understandings ; be
sides the pcrfcct knowledge the French
patriots have acquired of th? rights of
man, they know also, that wolves are but
artificial beings in the human species ; they
have found them t i morour, and even
more so than those they had terrified du-,
ring several centuries : if they found them
superior to themselves, it was only in
falfities and treachery."
[from Correjponder:ti.~\
It is observed by many philosophers in
the old world, that if VICE did not ex
it!, Virtue would not be known." This
axiom is evidently verified in the new
world. While we congratulate the foils
and daughters of Columbia on the re-elec
tion of our virtuous Prejident and Vice
president, it is fmcerely hoped that neither
of these re-elections will prove injurious to
the cause of freedom. The cafe of the
French emigrants among that gallant, and
now free nation, teaches us, that ambition
Dnce taking pnffeflion of the human brealt",
cannot be eaiily eradicated. At the fame
time, we are taught by the French repub
lican patriots, that principles ofariftocra
cy may, by proper inftrufction, be changed
into wholesome democracy, and that the
fh-ong desire for titles and diftinftions of
nobility may, in the end, concur with the
democratic principle in forwarding the
glorious eftablifiiment of a plain, otcono
nomic, republican government, supported
an the balis of liberty and equality.
The writings of an aristocratic, specula
ting faction at Hartford, in favor of mo
narchy and titular diftinftions, and pub
lidied in their papers, are fufficient to con
vince any candid person, that the old in
'ular enemy to the independence and pros
perity of America has her hired emiifaries
at work in that part of the Union, to bring
ibou.t a political change, and, as far aspof
ible, give our government a twist into the
'l.apc of her own corrupted form. It is
"ome confblation that the aftnine poison of
hefe writers has very little circulation be
fond a certain Jpct, and that even in " the
lot-bed of American aristocracy," it is ge
nerally despised. The writers,
uded to, as profcll'mg openly the fame
principles, may be considered equally
nimical withthe old defund tories of 1775,
ind in reality their fupplememifts and fuc
:efibrs; and tho' their political duration
may be co-eval with the present imported
British system in this country, they must
fall oif when that is become (as it soon
mud be) an object of univerfaldeteftation,
.onteinpt, and abhorrence.

A writer in a late paper laments that
Louis the fifteenth is no longer an object of
regard with the republican citizens Of the
United States ; and accuses thetn of ingra
titude 111 not, at least, coinmiferatijig the
man " who facrificed his crown to eman
cipate the Western world," &c. Without
controverting the truth of this alfertion,
we may jnft observe there was a time, alio,
when General Arnold was entitled to the
praise and gratitude of all Americans.
Subsequent events, however, let them in
to a knowledge of his true character, and,
ever since, the debt of gratitude has been
considered as 110 longer due. The final
("entence of the National Convention w ill,
doubtless, soon unveil the real character of
Louis to the eye of the v orld : but there
will always be a parry in this country,
who, with refpeft to the fallen French mo
narch, or whenever a culprit king is in the
cafe, will be apt to cry out, with the Ro
man in the playâ
" Take care, speak sure, think well, and
lay no blame,
Cesar did never wrongâbut with iuffc
cause!"
Withfome people, defeftsare every day
becoming more and more apparent in the
old state constitutions. With increase of
[alary and political consequence a fort of
wonderful new light has fallen upon many,
that enables them to discern faults, which
formerly were imperceptible 10 the best
understandings. The truth is, that the old
state constitutions, in general, have too
much of the simplicity of republicanism in
themfor Come modern tastes. A new fort of
leaven is wanting to make puff-pafle ; and
if the old batch .of thirteen was not pro
perly raif'ed, there are newfangled bakers
in abundance that offer to cotjolidatexhtw
into one loaf, and make it as light as ;i
muffin* A writer in a New-Jersey paper
has broached the following odd opinion on
thisfubjeftâ" The N. JeiTey state confli
tution was formed at a period when the
trne principles of a representative govern
ment were but imperfectly undci floodâ
The politicians of that day were theorijls
rather than practitioners. Experience has
since proved to what perfection tlie/oj'ranf
a representative government can be earn
edâl fay, repre/entdtive, in a contradif
tinftion to republican, or democratic ! ! !

Newport, R. I. 2d 3d month, 1757.
JlI. Condorcet's ReJleSiotis on the EngHjl
Revolution of 1688, and that of France,
on the 10th of Augufl, 1792.
Â£Continued from No. 134, and concluded.'
WE tell the English, the Dutch.
the Swiss, the Swedes, the in
habitants of the Imperial cities, and thof;
fubjefh of the princes of the Empire, whe
have ft ill preserved forne franchifes, as wel
as the various nobles who reside in the
States of Hungary, Audria, and Bohe
mia, that our cause is theirs, and that the)
cannct support the maxims of the Empe
ror and the King of Pruflia without abju
ring all their rights, and consecrating
themfelvcs to servitude.
" There are two species of free conftitu
tions in exillence, or at least having ch':
forms of freedom.âThe firft, like those ol
a part of the United States of America,
have one single prin iple of decision, by
which all questions on which judgment
nuift be pafled, and all affairs in which
public fafety requires an affcive part (hould
be taken, are necefTai ily brought to a con
clusion.
" The other, on the contrary, like the
Enghfh conftitntion, has a double or a tri
ple principle of dtcifion. According to
this, nothing less than the agreement of all
the powers to which the right of deciding
is confided, can produce a final determina
tion, and the want of agreement between
these independent powers, can flop the ac
tivity of the social Ivl'tem,
" If constitutions like this have been the
result of the ancient cultoms of a nationâ
if at the moment in which they have assu
med a regular form, those to whom they
gave a right of acting in contradiction to
the will of the people, have had the pru
dence never to practice this right ; if, in-
Head of an unity of principle established by
law, tl.eir policy has fubftitutcd another,
(as in England for example) the maxim ol
never refilling the two Houses of Parlia
ment, and of never aÂ£ting in contradiction
even of one of them, except on Extraordi
nary occasions, when the majority is weal;
and appears not to;accord with the national
will, then, indeed, such coiiftitutions may
continue for a long time without exciting
tr ,Ã¼bles.
" But if, on the contrary, the habit o!
d lguifing an efTentialand radical vice (houlc
not prevail 5 if in a firft attempt those whe
exercised a negative right over the repre
fentatives of the people, have abused that
right ; if the nation has been informed ol
the inconveniencies and dangers resulting
from this combination of independent
powers, then such a constitution cannot
but be fatal to the tranquility and the
freedom of the citizens; Then unity of
principle becomes an cfFential condition ol
the social fyfttm, and the na'ion would be
ixpofed to proreed from revolution to re
volution,till it ffiould arrive at the necefTarv
fimpbeity; because it could no longer nil
fatisfied with pofleffing it in fait, as
prcfent in England ; for it cos.ld never
fuppoie itftlf secure, unless she principle
were eftabbflied bylaw.
" 1 bus the unfortunate attempt made
in trance, to form a constitution with .1
double principle, has rendered its continu
ance impossible. This, enlightened men
foretold, but their counsel* were rejected,
1 he person to whom the dangerous right
of opposition was Â«ntrufted, as might have
been forefeen, beheld in this right the
means only of suspending the adtivity ol
the two powers, of betraying them with
impunity, and by the aid of the constitu
tion, todeftroy freedom.
" From this t me, therefore, foreigr
powers may contemplate France asdirefted
to the future by one united will; and that,
in her external connections, (lie can hav;
no other motive for adVon, but tha' o:
uifety and prosperity. All States, what
ever their government, from the Kings o<
Sardinia and Naples, to the Republics o
Basle and Zurich, from the Dukes of S:ix
:>ny and Wirtembcjg, to the cities o
Hamburgh or of Franckfort, ought it
-onfider trance as the only barrier, ovei
the whole continent, which can be oppo
fed to the coalition of great monarchies
and the sole guarantee of the independenci
of in lerior powers.
" Mean time all ideas of a fadkion npar:
from the nation itftlf, of a will of the peo
pie of Paris diftintt from that of the de
partments, all the chimeras credited b\
[he court of the Thuillerie's, and of in'
triguing parti fans, who call themfclves con
Ititutional, all the fables, under the guid
v?.ce of which Louis XVI. condudiec
his double conspiracy, no longer cat
deceive any man ; and Europe cannol
but be convinced, that Russia and Au
hia alone have an interest in troubling
France; that the King of Prussia is the
iupe of that ambition with which they have
nfpired him, and that his fafetv, like that
if the other independent States of Europe.
;s connected with the preservation of the
po . er of France, which cannot be deitroy
eJ without dragging after it in its fall the
fovereignty and freedom of all other nati
311 S.
" Such is the point of view in which
the revolution of the 10th of August can
not fail to be seen by men capable of re
(kdlion, whatever may be their country
and their principles.
" Whoever wilh not to pass under the
yoke of Catharine, Francis, or William,
all who hope to preserve their property, li
berty, and some little honor, independent
Df their gracious will and pleasure, ought
to combine with the French nation, and
universally to unite in opposition to that
tile swarm of marauders, who under the
name of French emigrants, have spread
falfliood and corruption through foreign
countries. What ! can the heroes who
have served under Fredrick the Great,
Dau'n, and Laudun, defcetid to be thr
'ile instruments of Calonne, Breteuil, and
Bouille, alternately fattened by the blood
Itieaming from their negroes, and the in
irigiies of miftrefTes and ministers, in, the
profits of which they partook ?
"Will the Prussian nation perfill in
naking war on the French, who considered
.in alliance with Prussia as a means of ef
:aping the snares laid by the court of Louis
XVI ? A war made in favour of that very
court which refufed this alliance, and fa
criiiced the interest of France and the fafe
ty of Prussia to the ambition of the house
of Austria ? How can the European pow
e'f, who have acknowledged the Prince of
Orange as the fubititute of James 2d. dif
npprove the elediive council that has been
fubllituted to the King of the French :
Why cannot the French nation ast rela
tively to Louis XVI. as the United Pro
vinces of America have adted with respect
to George 111.
" Let us suppose that the French will
form a constitution founded on pure equal
ity; that this constitution, proposed by a
national convention in conformity to the
will of the people, should be fully adopted
by the nation ; that no hereditary rights,
no personal inviolability, no predominating
power, dangerous to liberty, fully this con
stitution, nor oblige it to invent a counter
poise, an opposition of power to power
deltiudlive of simplicity and the operations
of government ; that the expression of the
National Convention will become one;
tint no refinance can impede it; that the
people themselves appoint their own re
presentatives, and that sage precautions
prevent any inconveniencies which might
an'fe from these two lait inllitutions ; will
the powers of Europe then refufe to ac
knowledge us as a&ing for the nation, be
caule we (hall have rigorously followed tlu
iiiimmutahle principles of natural right:
If so, they mull avow, by their conduct.
that the principles which are true in Ame
nca, are falfe in Europe ; and that tlu
fartie maxim is true or falfe, criminal oi
virtuous, according as their insidious po
licy requires."
