From the Baltimore Evening Post.
IN a republican government, freedom of
fpeeclianc! fentmient on governmental
affairs, provided they do not degenerate
into anarchial licentioufnefsj is tonlklei ed
as the palladium ot libertyâLiberty con
fills in the sovereign pawer being veiled in
the people. Long hud the people ot'all na
tions not only yielded up the fruits of part,
but conceded a right to the fruits of future
labour, to the greedy avarice of kings anil
priells; until thel'e confederated dates re
moved and d filiated the clouds ot prepof
session and prejudice which darkened tin
intelle&ual worldâToo long had the hn
man race, born to equal rights and equal
freedom, been marked with haughty do
mination on the one part, and abj.ct thral
dom oil the other. America was the only
quarter of the globe that remained unpol
luted with the hideous monster of arbitra
ry powerâtis true, young as {he w : , cor
ruption had defiled herâbut an abortion
effected a purification. Experience, the
preceptor of wifdoin, taught her tliat with
out civil government to check vice ami
proieft virtue, tliere could be no true and
solid criterion of j.ilticeâThatthe arbitra
ry maxims elfjblillied by kings and pi'iefts
"of the ministers o 1 " government hating an
inherent right over the people" was tlie
mod abfnrd and spurious idea that ever
was adopted by i cominu lity. A repub
lie, where tile people at large choofn their
reprefcntative*, who when chiiien diverge
irom the different parts of the date, and
convene at a delignated place for the pur
pose of legifl ition, delineates one of the
mofl perfect fyltems of political mechanif.ii
that can be plainedâthis is thefy'leni thai
America Has chosen. Whatever is resolv
ed by this constituted authority cannot fail
of nfwfing filch fati failion in the mind a;
to cause regularity and harmony to operate
upon the will o. each member of society.
In ficli a government as this there is no
thing to create averfion âIf a person dele
gated, acto in opposition to the wilhes of his
con'.litueuts, the harmony of the fyllem is
easily redored by difpiacing him, & putting
ill a lother of a less jarring dispositionâthis
is what invigorates the springs of govern
ment, and gives them drength to withstand
the fliocks of ambitious men.
Peace and moderation is the spirit of a
republicâcultivate virtue and you eternize
its duration. The spirit of monarchy is
war and enlargement ot dominion ; {laugh
ter and avarice are the springs which keep
it in motion: from this we may infer at
ieaft the probability, that monarchy took
its rife from an extraneous principle tiiat
has spoiled the original delicate texture of
the heart, and caused it to become the
abode of all those paflions and corrupt al
feitions which we experience to flow ironi
thence and de'lroy the peace and harmony
of mankind.âWithout a delution or sen
ses and a perveriion of understanding. the
mind is not capable of giving a preference
to monarchy, becaufp there is nothing nil -
tricient to a political union; a id he mull
be a unique in politics indeed, who thinks,
that a durable political Jtru&ure can be
erected upon {laughter and avarice, be
caule it is morally impollible.
11 is the opinion of some, that a govern
ment composed of the three original ones,
is bed calculated to advance tie welfart
and prosperity of a nation. The princi
pies of the three governments areâVirtue,
or amor patriiE, the mod sublime of all so
cial virtues; this is the principle of a re
public ; here it is that each organ found
Liberty and Equality. Honour, that is tlit
prejudice of every person and every rank,
or a delire of exalting one's felt upon thi
downs all of another, is the principle wlp' I
sets themonarchical wheel in motion; hen
it is that one part of the creation is. toilim
to fnpport the other in luxury and gran
deur. Fear is the other ingredient t<
complete the jarring mixture, this is tht
principle of despotism ; here it is that ma;
is a creature that submits to the abfoluti
â will of a creature like himfelf, man's por

compliance, and punifliment. Tile gov

encomiums have been and are daily lavish.
Ed, and which is so much admired by tli
arifiocrnts, or to fimplify the word, torie
of America) prefects to our view the ti re<

but time will develope to them light tc
extricate themlelv.es from the error o
despotic education and ignorant prepof

America has taught France, and is abtfni
to teach the world, to tranfmnte govern

people may be capable of a more actele

and prosperity which we enjoy, is now ii
the embryo of time for-every other mtior
upon the g obe, and nothing is wanting tc
give it birth but virtue and conrnge.
The government of the American States
appears to me to be better calculated for
the happiness of mankind than any other:
brca.ile it has a gre.t-r conformation to
the equality that v. edifcover in tinman na

from the fubjeÂ£tiou of another, so far onl>
as the harmony and oeconoifiy of govern

It is to trie foiriewhat afto'nifliing, that

This, then, is the grand conjn .ct 111 e in
which each citizen (houltl make every cf

this not prove, beyond the possibility of a

The days of chivalry and delulion are over,
arid the riurfe of wifdoin, virtue arid inaniv
leiitiiuent, has begun to tutor the world
âa fyllem of politics, founded upon such
prim iples-, that, like mathematical pro
grelEon, every Hep forces the afl'ent of the
tnhid as they advance; and conducts it at
iail, overpowered with conviction, to the
truth proposed to be demonflrated.
A fyltein ot' government founded upon
rational conviction, is the only one that
c m pollibiy tend to the removal of public
and private d fcontent, disorder and mlfe
y; and fubftltute in theirplace public and
private content, harmony, profpenty and
universal happitiefsâA fyllem which Ame

adopted, would effectually banilh ftwrj
from the human race, enfnre to all man

thehifelves of this happiness. they must cul
tivate virtue; because it is the guardian
of liberty ; morals, without which true
pairiotiftn can never glow in the human
breastâeducation, because it is the source
of morality. They mull reward zeal for the
public good, by punifliing fraud and court
intrigue. Whilfl this continues to be done,
I venture with confidence to predtt, that

Thefentiments contained in the following

If you are absolved, more than ever b'efs

our bands of union are to be llrengthentd

Extract of a letter from fort IVajhington,
dated dttgujl 26, 1793.
" The army has 110 c yet moved, but ge
neral Wayne is indefatigable in every ne
tefiary preparation. Every thing m3y be ex
acted from him which prudence, courage
'ltd discipline can produce, so far as he is
icquainted with his enemy. Our numbers
ire fufficient; and no one thing is wanting
n the arrangements. Besides the regular
troops, one thousand volunteers under gen.
kott from Kentucky will march out with
is, as a dirtinft army, and these being all
counted, are thought of themselves to be
tqual to all the Indians who will make
lead against us. It is said we fh&ll march
kvichin twenty four hours after an expref:
"rives from the commiflioners, unless they
idvife to the contrary. We (hall proceed

" This day the trial of ensign John Mor

as necessary to his defence, he addreffeci
the court to the following purport; I be
ieve in these very words. â¢' Gentlemen,
I do not wilh to fay a word is my defence,

â¢' Unfortunately for General St. Clair,
he had been induced to give in an addition
al charge against Morgan, accusing him 01
faljekaod, unbecoming the character of a>,
officer and a gentleman, \n writing to the
Secretary at War, that GenÂ»ral Butler,
one of the best and bravest of naen was
killed in, or on, or during a charge en the
enemy, and that iie Was by his iide ; I fay
that t!i;s hasten To inconteftibly and hn
uorabiy proved by volunteer evidence, (for
it is laid Morgan difdaiued u leek any;
that the accafation is held in the titmoft
abhorrence. I will give yon the lubltance
ot one teltimopiy on this subject.
'' Serjeant Major M'Kee being fÂ»vorn,
teltihjd, that on the of November,
r 79'< be followed Gen. Butler on a charge
on the Indians, made by Major Butler at
the head oi his battalion ; that in animat
ing the men to the charge, Gen. Butler was
(hot through the body, and immediately
fell from his horse ; that this deponent
was one of the lirft men who endeavored
to aliUl h.'iil ; that at the moment of Gen.
Butler s falling, he, the deponent saw Mr.
Morgan at his lide ; that whilst he (this
neponent)John Motherel, and others were
carrying Gen. Butler to the center of the
:amp, Mr. Morgan continued to encourage
-he troops on to the charge, which enabled
this deponent &c. to carry offthe General's
July, by thu. covering them.
" ift, Quef. by the court. Did you fee
Gen. Butler fall in a charge 011 the eneniv ?
"Anf. I did.
"2d, Quef. Did you fee Mr. Morgan hy
[lis fide ?
"Anf. I did. He was close to him with
his fvvord drawn, animating the men to the
charge, calling in a llrong voice, charge,
charge, my brave fellows, the day is onr
own."
P' S. 20th. When I wrote the forego
ing 1 expected ere this, to have been Me
to have told you the result of Morgan's
court martialâbut after all the proceed
ings were closed in the manner above
mentioned, general St Clair, who has been
indefatigable in this business, induced the
court to open again their proceedings as he
had new evidence to off.-r. It seems that
he had failed in his proofs, even of Mr.
Morgan's having either written or publish
ed the letters lor which he was arretted,
and it was to ellablilh these, that he nÂ«w
wiihed a delay ; for whether these letters
were true or i lit', he f*ys they were equal
ly mutiny. The proceedings are now clos
ed, and next Monday Air. Morgan wba
confefl'ed his having written the letters,is to
give in his jultifrcatiou of them, indifferent
(after having eltabli'hed the truth of every
allertion in Jiis letters) what the conse
quences may be. No news yet from the
Treaty."
Whoever takes a view of these States at
the present period, must be convinced that
a great political retorniation has within

From the Baltimore F.vening PoO.
T 0 the Editor of the Baltimose Evem
ing Post.
Sir.
SINCE ray return from "Norfolk I have
learned with no final! unealincfs, that tin
" F.xtraft of a letteriVom ti gentleman tra
velling to the fouthsyard,". which has been
f ptiSlifhcd i:i on? cf PJjilndelphic p^perSj
I]cJ thence copied into the Baltimore kven
' i;ig Post of the 26th lilt. has been generally
i ascribed tome. I therefore think it incum
ber, t on mc, in the mo.ft politive and ex
â  1 eft manner, to affiire the public, that I
neither wrote, dilated, nor publifned a
n ;!e line of it.
'i'he similarity of some of the cirenm
ftannces mentioned in the Extrait, tothofe
which occurred on niv arrival at Murray's
tavern, the place v here the guard waÂ«
placed, renders it necefi'ary to enter into
lome detail on the subject.
In writing to my family after my arrival
at Gray's gardens, I informed them- that
I had been flopped with tjje whole of the
paflengers, twelve in number, about two
miles from Baltimore: that we Were dm en
out of the tavern ; into which, during the
absence of Murray, we had entered ; that
one of the guard had threatened to fire
at me three times for walking within his
lire, although I was uninformed of the
e-tent of it: And, from the darkness of
the night, it was hardly pollible to distin
guish it, even if he had eonde/cended to
point it out, which he negleftcd to do:
that for the fame offeucf lie had flruck an
elderly Frenchman on the cheek with his
bayonet ; that we flcpt or dosed in the
stage for three or four hours; that then
finding ourselves cold and uncomfortable
we kindled a fire in the wood?, and slept
before it, some on trunks, and others on
thegrafs; that at 8 o'clock next morning
when the landlord was at breakfaft, we i~< n:
to him for some victuals, which he very hu
manely refufed to give us; that about
ten, or half after ten, he relented, and
Tent to inform u-\ we might baie some
bread, cheese, cyder, and wine; that t. e
accepted the offer ; rti.it we were detained
. i this manner (a lady, the wife ot a French
captain, in the comp ny.) without any
(helter but. the stage and the woods, from
8 o'clock TuefdavÂ«night, until Wednesday
afternoon ; and that I then remained at
Grav's 't:l! tlxe Alexandria stage set off.
All this 1 wroteâand this only.âAnd I
challenge any man to disprove a lingl? cir
:umttance of it. M. Tiebout, cominand< r
;il the French vcflel, now lying at Fell's
Point, one of the passengers, can, and, if
applied to. w ill confirm every article of
st. If it'be criminal to write the tiuth,
f acknowledge inyfelf a criminal.
1 pnrpofely Wave, as foreign to my pre
ent pnrpofe, every enquiry, whether all
:he precautions Eeceflary for the preferva
ioil of Baltimore, are not compatible witll
"ome degree of attention to the ease and
â¢o'lvenicnee of travellers; whether tents
>r temporary liied= ought not to beerefted j
ivhether paflengers Hopped on their jotir
ley, ought not to be secure of being able,
when iu nfeceility, to purchase provisions;
,vSiether meafnres of wl ich the legality is
â  nteli'dly t)!(" ! 'ioii:ih!ie, and whii.li no
ting but the paramount law of felf pre
ervatibn could jullify, ought not to lie
carried into effect, with_the u tin oft lenity.
1 hefe, and a variety of other enquiries,
ivhich arise from, and are int li-.ately c,on
iiefted with a difcuflion of this ftil-j-.o , I
Lave to abler pens to investigate.
To return to the Jpltrii its ex!raft of" a
letter. At my return home, I may perhaps
be able to trace it to its real author, and to
r.jeak positively on the subject. But for
the ptefent, I can on'y account for it, by
supposing thai the Editor of the Philadel
phia paper in which it marie its appearance,
heard perhaps at second, third, or fourth
hand, of the contents of my letterâand
thÂ»u haflied up the garbled, ni'freprefent
etl account into " an extract oi a letter,
as an article of intelligence. This. I be
lieve, wiH b* ultimately found to be the
real Hate of the affair ; for J am f.itisfied
Co be branded as infamous, if thefabrita
ior, or publilher of the evlrai", can p.o
duce any person to whom I \yrote it, t-r
prove, or even render il probable, that it
was taken from any letter of mine.
A writer, who figus himfelf L 'Philo Ve
rltatis," has embraced this opportunity of
iiifplaying his l terary t.-.lentr, which he has
really done moit admirably. He severely .
renfures the Baltimore printer forthe " le

I liiail not attempt to defend myfeif. '1 hi fe

them. Tbofe who do not, might reftife

P. S. I fbould not do jnftice, were I not
to declare that Serjeant Stiwr, who com
manded the part;. 011 guard, on Tuesday

' & IHE present crisis is important to the
1 world in general. The flruggle of
expiring defpotifrn will eventually be pro
ductive of consequences with the fate
of millions yet unborn. Such as can view
the present fra with the eye of indifference
/null be calousto feeling and poffcfs a flo
ical insensibility. Patriotism cannot influ
ence their hearts. Let the idea of the
subjugation of France be once admitted,
r.nd th * mind of tk-'true Patriot, the friend
of mankind is filled with painful sensations
in contemplating tVe consequent misery,
f nding the extinction of that sacred fire
which now animates the breads of free
dom's sons in the eastern world. Religion,
if paR experience proves anything, would
become subservient to the bafefl purposes.
Calculated by its divine author, to pro
mote the happiness of mankind; an'
Fraught with sentiments declaratory of
on earth, and good will to men ; it
would be converted into rhe tool of def
potilm. and the chain of arbitrary power,
by the monitions conjunction of church
and Hate. The gueftion in despotic courts
is not what religion is acceptable to God ?
They enquire not whether the articlts of
their creed conefpond with divine revela
tion ? The aspiring despot, and the subtle
courtier form an eccleliallical eftablifhmetit
which moll effectually Lcures to them the
poffeilion of aflumed power, and the de
pendence of th .r slaves.
Civil liberty, which once Stimulated the
brave Americans to the noblefl acts of
heroism, would on!y be remembered as 2
pieafir.g dream by the mcutners furrotmd
â ing her sacred urn. The generous patriot
would lament in secret the misery of man,
condemned to tread the rugged paths of
life in chains. The parent, who once en
joyed the blefiings- of freedom, would
drop tiie sympathetic tear, while reflecting
on the m ferable fubjedlion to which his
children r>re born. The ndnftiioas hus
bandman, and the humble mechanic, find
ing no security in the poffefiion of their
well earned property, would relax in their
pursuits after honelt gain. Supinenefs
would pervade the wretched fuljeds of ty
rants, and the hand of industry would be
enfeebled. Taxation without representa
tion ; tri.da without juries, oppreflion with
out redress ; the unnatural degradation of
the multitude, an! unmerited exaltation
of court fy copharts and worlhippers in the
temple of monarchy, ;<re the prominent
features of the monger that strives to raise
its diminished head, and ur.i
vcrfal dominion over mankind. The en
lightened mind of man recoils at the bare
pr babiiiiy of the extinction of reason,
and the triumph of defpotifrn. Shrrl ty
rants again fatten on the foil manured with
flavcry, and watered with the tear of op
prrfifi 'i ? S'all ihe votaries of defpotifrn,
more impious than Moloch's worlhipper3,
ct the head of hcllile bauds, again desolate
the world, and deal misery and death with
unsparing hand among the innoccnt vict
ims of their rage ? Forbid it Heaven !
This is the period which decides the
important quellion, shall man be free ?
Such are the views which prsfent to the
mind of Americans in ant cipating the
â¢ conquest of the patriotic French. Every
good citizen, however, deprecates the evil.
Tueyfeel interested in the eventful ftrug
gl ; while gratitude, duty, sentiment, the
common cause of liberty, with perfnafive
eloquence, demand the infant arm of Ame
rica to relieve a filler in distress. Interelt,
too, if teveriionary blessings are worth Se
curing, points out the propriety of render
ing eSedlive assistance to our injured ally,
if required. Despising the motives which
influence the friends of monarchy in Ame
rica to assume a dove-like appearance by
talking of:the blefiings of peace, and the
advantages of neutrality, they dare ttot
pnrchafe these at the expence of Ameri
can faith and republican virtue. When
these gentlemen become the advocates of
peace in Britain, and condemn the breach
of neutrality there, their sincerity will be
less doubted.
The hackneyed argument in favour of
a renunciation of our alliance with France,
arising from the condemnation and death
of Louis Capet, is unworthy a serious re
ply. If the exilling treaty had been en
tered into for the mutual guaranteeing
the heads of the higt contradling parties ;
if the extinction of privileged orders in
France, or the ereilion of arillocracy in
America bad been ftipulatcd as causes of
â¢disunion then the treaty would be equally
alFefked in its operation, by the decapita
tion of Louis in France, or the creation
of an ariftoeratic rule here. The execu
tive of the United States, and the French
miniilry, as the representatives of the king
their matter, in the formation of that treaty
mntnally engage, on the behalf of their
refpeftive nations, for the peiformance ol
articles ftiputated, equally advantageous to
the citizens of both countries with refpefl
to commerce and war. It refp'fted not
the internal government of France or A
merica ; and no relative change in the
conditutiou or policies of either can annul
those obligations or render the treaty inef
fe&ua!. While, therefore, tl e goo 1 faith
of France is experienced, Republican A
meiicai>s will rejoice in the alliance, and
render all the â¢iflitlance (he claims in the
hour of her didrtfs from the unsophisticat
ed conftrutlion of the bond of union.
The late decree of the National Conven
tion of France, announced to the public
by Mr. Secretary Jefferfon, which ope
rates so advantageously for the commercial
interest of the United States, and displays
"he of magnanimous France,
should raifea const ious blush on the checks
of tho e who have wounded the honour ol
America bv fophi tioating, and explaining
away the felf evidtnt meaning of words,
and the idea of trebles.
Tell it not in Britain, pisblilh it not if
the (Ireets of London, that the civil au
thority of America hath been exerted tc
punish as delinquents her citizens for en
gaging in the common cause of mankind
â under the banners of France in oppoling
her numerous foes, led the votaries of del
potifm tiiumph in the defection of the
leaders of our country, and rejoice in the
extitiiflion of that flame from whence the
lons of Gallia derived their sacred fire.
Citizen Patriots, can yoarefufe the tri
bute of gratitude due to the TWELVE
who, defpifingthe influence of a felf-confe
quentialexpounder of law, ftaodnokly-firm,
"and difappoinied the hopes of an aspiring
fa&ion ? And (hall the verdi6to of juries
be despised ? Shall the citizeni of Ameri
ca, the volunteers in the caide of man, be
flill pursued by niiniflerial vengeance:
Doth Balak, the prince of Moab, hope
by change of time and phce to curse the
people ? Disappointment and (lmme (hall

" At length I have the pleasure of com
municating to you the most ]>!ea(ingevents.
We have fought several days fuccefively,
and the action of the 18th completed our
joy. and gra'itude towards the Supreme
Being. The christian and royal army has
entirely dellvoyed that of tie ithtijls.
They have had fix >thousand killed, nearly
the fame number wounded, and threÂ«thou
fand made prisoners. The remainder are
so dispersed, that they will not appear a
gain. All their artillery, ammunition wag
gons, baggage and provisions, are in our
pofleffion.
" God has blefied us with a complete
victory. His aid also manifefled itfelf
rowards 11s on the 24th instant. We bad
heard that the bridge of Ce, was guarded
by four thousand men : we in consequence
approached within a league of it 011 the
23d, and the next> day at three in the
morning, we ranged our small army in or
der of battle tÂ» attack it at day-break.
" The enemy fuffered us to approach
within cannon (hot, and then discharged
twelve pieces at us.âWe immediately cri
ed out, the fivord of God and Louis hisfol
lenver, and rushed like lions on the four
thousand men, put them all to the sword,
and took all their artillery. There, on the
bridge dyed with the blood of the enemies
of God, we made the air resound with the
praises of (be Lord, whose exterminating
angel undoubtedly marches before us.
" After this lalt viftary we entered An
gers, where the white flag is flying on all
fides, as well as in almost all the provin
ces of Anjou- We have just dispatched
a courier to order the colunjn of the royal
army, (lationed beyond the bridges oi
Nantes, to approach that city on the 4th
of AuguH, in order to give the alarm on
that fide, but to undertake nothing, until
