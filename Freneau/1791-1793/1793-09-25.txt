Advertiser of September 12.
tT is not unfrequent to ohfrrve of late in
the ministerial, 01 court papers, all tlie
power? of rlietoric and ridicule exerted, to
fupprefa every free comment upon govern
mental nieafures & every scrutiny into the
official conduct of its individual adinrnlftra
tora; to cffeÂ£t this nbj"tl a new species of
threats against some printers, have not
been withheld. The free difcuflion of these
fubjeftscan be objectionable or flangerous,
but upon one principle (to wit) an adm\fiion
of the inability of the great majority of the
people to form tempcrare and right conclu
sions from such difeufliofls. 1 his adminu'ii
would be insulting to tile people. 1: would
be improper in itfelf, because it is uniform
ly contradiQed by the fact. It is pointedly
repugnant to the fundamental principle ol
our government. The ability of the.peo
ple to govern themfelve<, is the ground
work of our constitution, every informaii
on furnilhed refpeSting their political right!
and governmental proceedings, is an addi
tion to their intelligence, a:.d of ccurle to
the means of judging rightly. The mo
tives inducing this gross attack upon the
liberty of the press, by a party, cannot be
mistaken, they spring from a confcioulnefs
of the unnatural state of internal affairs,
produced by the artifice & partiality of ad
ministration, from their fears, that the peo
ple will become informed, ai'd the conse
quent effeÂ£t of the information will be.the
correction of ad mini ft r a lion, by the irre
fiftible pronunciation of the public will.
The difcuflions refpedting the late pro
clamation of neutrality, havo been the mod
criminated and reviled. The affeitioiu
of the people for the perjan of the Presi
dent, and their virtuoys gratitncie f'Â»r his
former Jerv'ccs have been courted in the
irioF insinuating manner, lo proneutice a
condemnation against thrift who have dared
to fp.*alt their opinions relpecting cnc of hi:
official acts. That the President's feelings
should have sustained an injury from the pun
gency of these discussions, is to be regretted;
every good man will conctir in rendering
tribute to his patriotism and good intenti
on ; but tt is thought, a compensation i;
afforded to the public for this dircumftancc
in the good effe&s attributable in some mea
sure to these difcuflions. The great ma
jority of the people upon this, as opor
rnoft other fubjetts, which are fairlj
brought before them, feein to have decidec
with the most temperate propriety, anc
this decision has furnifhed ajnlt condem
nation of the party who would interrupt
the free course of political inreftigations.
If the newspapers may be looked at the
mirror reflecting truly the public miild, ii
would present an opinion very generally
concurring upon this delicately interesting
fubjett The public mind from the ex
treme! of N. Hamplhlre, to the extremes
of Georgia, seem to have fettled upon these
two primary points. Firft,thsÂ»t there ought to
be an honourable compliance with the treaty
between the United Aates and France â
2d, That a ftriÂ£t neutrality towards the
powers at war, ought to be observed. Ho
nor, duty, intertf, gratitude, would de
mind the firft measure, the enchanting ad
vantpges of peace would require the latter.
If acting upon these two principles, fnoulc
involve 110 incompatibility of condtift, the
great majority of the people would proba
bly be found to unite in the opinions of it!
propriety. There would still be found,
however, a contemptible Britlfh factien.
perhaps with our financial officer at theii
head, who would willingly disavow a com
pliance with the treaty, and attempt s
more intimate connexion with Britain.â
This policy is dittated by two motives, tht
one, a preference for the Britifli govern,
ment ,and a latent hope, that ours may ul
timately be run into a similar mould ; thj
other, the dependence of the darling fund
ing system upon a commercial conpeftioi
with Brirain, and the apprehension, thai
an interruption of our Britifli commerce
would interrupt the punflual payments ol
the interest upon the funded debt.
The original difference of opinion re
fpefting the Proclamation, seems rather tc
l:ave referred, to the contlruttive oijelt ol
it, than the mere ad of ifiuing it. Its op
pofers have acted under the conftruÂ£tive
idea, that it was intended to elude an ho
norable compliance .with our treaty with
France; its favorites have been of opinion,
that it was intended as a mere declaration
â¢f the existing state of the u?tion, and not
intended to vary or change its pre ex'tfting
lignature.
Ii the former were its object, the Pro
clamation would be every where justly
condemned. li'tlie latter were its otijeit,
its rauli inveterate enemies mult admit, it
would have been at least harmlef?. The
latter having been explained by subsequent
aits to have been the intention of the pro
clamation, it is presumed, no material dif
ference of opinion can now exist lipon that
fubjeil.âlt is somewhat lingular that
there fnould have appeared in print, but
one fyfiematjc attempt to defend the pro
clamation; it is more lingular that its fa
vorers P.tould almolt unanimously, acqui
esce Fn the supposed success of tlris attempt,
and It is molt lingular, that with many,
the defence Ihomd turn out the proclama
tion's fevered accuser. The defence al
luded to, has been presented to the public
in leveral pieces under tile iignature o! Pa
cificus. Ihe flrft number which speaks o!
the conrtitutional right of the l'relident to
ifl'ue a proclamation inipoling neutrality,
teems with 'contradictions and absurdities.
The doflrines it inculcates u are of a na
ture to excite attention âto beget alarm
to inspire doubts. Deductions of a verj
extraordinary complexion lr.aj, -.vifhout
forcing the sense, be drawn from them.
it is not proposed lo attempt a fyftema
tic refutation of Pacificu . the attempt
wojjld be troublesome and unpleasant tc
the writer, and unprofitable to the reader ;
iv is intended only to point rut two or three
pontradiftions and absurdities ;n his iirll
number.âPacificus fir ft atferl s, that the
object of the proclamation was, merely tc
declare the existing date of the nation ii
the next place he aflerts, the object to have
been, to disavow a compliance with th<
nth article of the treaty with France
Here then is. the nioft radical and eflentia
cpHtradiflioa in the awwed nbjatt of the
proclamation. It will be readily admittei
that the Prelident may of right proclain
theexiiling slate of the nation, whenevei
he may think proper, but it would be 'â¢
folly in him to do so, without the existence
ijf some extraordinary caufe.âlt will ai
the fame time be pofuively denied, that he
may of r'ght dispense with one tittle oi ai'
rxi'fting treaty, or that he is the conftitute<
tribunal of decision for that purppfe. The
right to dispense with one article of a trea
ty necellarily includes a concurrent right
to dispense with any other ; if, therefore
it be admitted, that the Preiident may dis
pense with one article of a treaty, he
may if tight dispense with all treaties: A
fir Hot*, he may dispense with all laws;
conlliuitiohally yielding to treaties whet
brought in to collision.âThe chiefqueltion,
which has agitated the public mind, result
ing from the proclamation, has been, whe
ther it was, or was not, intended to have
the force of law? Pacificus teachei
lis, that it is not only equivalent to the or
dinary municipal regulations, but is ever
uperior to the Jupreme law of the land
iince it may repeal, or what amounts tc
'.lie fame thin;;, dispense with its execution
It is however tielieved, that this is only the
infatuated wilb of the sophist, and not the
sbjeÂ£t of the Prelident.âPacificus nexi
proceeds to search the canltitufion for this
right in the Prelident, and inltead of find
ing it in express terms, deduces it from the
words " Executive power" These word:
are nothing more than the mere designa
tion of a department, they do not amotfnt tc
the ceflion ot a fcintiila of authority. âThe
term "executive power," when applicable
to government, and left otherwise undefin
;d,isa relative term. To afcertaiii its mean
ing, and limit its extent, reference must be
nad to its meaning and extent in other go
vernments. It appears obviotlfly to have
been the intention of the writer, that En
gland lhouid be refoted to, as the orthodox
itandard of definition, and under the sweep
ing influence of thiÂ» reasoning, the Preli
dent would be furnilhed with the fume
strong arm in America, which, is compofec
jf the royal executive prerogatives there
The only check supplied by our sophist
:cnlifls of the rights exprejsly reserved t<
:he people in the conllitution. The ron
(litution being an affirmative grant of au
thorities, anel not a negative reservation of
rights, would afford a check, truly impotent
and unavailing.
It is not proposed to enlarge upon the
old topic of conltruetive powers; it could
not be effectually done without encroach
ing upon the ground occupied by Publius in
1788. For my next number, therefore, a
republication of number XXXI3I of the
firft vol. and part of number XLI of fecund
volume, page 46, 47, of the once federal
Pliblius; an exiraÂ£t from the report upon
manufactures, and so much as Pacificus as
immediately relates to this fubjeÂ£t, will be
reqeftect.âThe public may thus behold the
progrelfive ftateot "federal orthodoxy.''
The public will find the ground then oc
cupied by Pilblius, now occupied by the
minority of Congress ; all their efforts feein
to ha"ve been directed towards an adminis
tration of the government upon the adopt
*nS conftruft'oH of the Constitution, whilst,
if the ideal Pubiius of 1788, and Pacificus
of 1793, ftiÂ°uld unite in the Tame real per
son. it will be observed that Pubiius has
advanced from the found sense and solid
reasonings which procured him the exclu
sive appellation of 44 The Federali{t," to a
more extravagant cafuiltry than has ever
been furnilhed in the exfuffolate surmises
of the molt jealous Antifederal.
The sophist having observed that this
fccpe of reasoning was wholly unneceflary
for ths direct object in view, and leaving
the reader to infer that his collateral ob
ieÂ£t in having tlfed it, was to familiarize
the public mind to this boundless adminis
trative conftruilion,proceeds to deduce the
rqjht of the President from this expreflion,
" He (hall take care that the laws be faith
fully executed." It is a strange inference
indeed 1 that a duty impojcd to execute the
laws, fliould involve the right to controul
or dijpenfe with their execu'iou. This in
ference decorates the dotlrine of implication
with all its fantaftical fubtilties.
The ease of removal from office ha?
been adduced as an exemplification of the
conclusions of the sophist, in the cafe of the
proclamation: In that cafe the question
was, whether the President, whocimflitu
tionally polfefl'es the right of appointment
to office, fijouid exclusively exereife the
removal from office, in which lat
ter c,.Â£'he C onftitutio!l was silent? or
whether in the cafe of removal fume other
branch of tire government fiiouii! Partici
pate with him ?âln the cafe of removal,
a law was found neceftury to fan&ion the
'xercife of the right in the President ; the
ilfent of the other branches of the go
vernment were then deemed indifpenfa
jle, If the cases be analagons, why are
:hefe requisites now dispensed with ? they
:ertalnly ought not to be upon the Jcore of
inalagy. In the cafe ot removal from
office, the right of appointment being con
litutionally veiled in the President, the
ight of removal was deemed incidental to
t. If the fame reasoning were to prevail
in the cafe of the proclamation, it would
i'eft the right, at least of deciding on the
validity of treaties, in Congress collectively,
ind riot in the President exclusively. be
:aufe the general authority of declaring
war, is vetted in Congress collectively, and
not in the President exclusively, and the
Jecifion refpefting the efficacy or inefiicaey
of exilting treaties, seems inseparably con
nected with that right. The constitutional
object of,veiling Congress colleÂ£tively with
the right to declare war. was to prevent
the United States from being drawn into
war, without the content of the people.
If the President ufiirp the right of refil
ing a compliance with treaties, he may in
volve the United States in a war, not only
without the cdnfent, but againlt the wiflies
md interests of the people ; and by this
ophiftical artifice, the mod wife and va
uable provision of the constitution, would
>e rendered unavailing. It Ihould be re
:olleÂ£ted, that there is no precise form of
â vorcts for declaring war, and a refufal to
:omply with an exilting treaty, may fub
lantially amount to a declaration of
,var, as it may be the jufl cauje of pro
â oking a war from tin oppo'liie cantratling
lation ; the fubllance of declaring war
nay thus be usurped by the Pr?lident,
â¢vhilft the shadow i> h ft for the amusement
if Congress. The present situation of the
Jnited States, furni'hes the molt striking
exampleâthe President by dispensing with
in exilting treaty, may provoke a war
with France. The mealure would plunge
the moll envenomed dagger into the hearts
:>f Uie American people. Although it is
leared that the reaforimgs of this dangerous
sophist were officially laid before the Pre
sident previously to i filling the proclama
tion, it is yet Imped, it is yet believed, that
lie could not lilU-n pleafurably to opinions
inducing so palpable a usurpation of pow
er. It is hoped tl at the President has not
determined to dispense with one tittle of
an ex',fling treaty, or that lie is the consti
tuted tribunal for making such a decision.
The President mull know that the attempt
tu l?ad America war 2gainft France,
[Total Numb. 199 ]
would either eventuate in exhibiting the
inefficacy of the constituted tribunals, wlaert
exerted against the virtuous affeÂ£tions of

A Uniform FedtrtlifiREMARKS on the FRENCH CON

REASON, Whatever may be our preju
dices, it will be granted, is : that uner
ring standard by which alone we are to
estimate the merits,. properties>or princi
ples of every thing which comes within the
circle of our observations. ImpreiTed with
this sentiment, I beg leave to offer a few
fpontaueous remarks tfa the new constitu
tion of t6^,T rencli Republic ; and while 1
bellow the tribute of my heart, 1 could
with my abilities to eulogise its excellencies
were equal to the unspeakable interest.
â which, as a man, as a philanthropist, as a
republican, but above all, as ail American,
I feel in its Uate. The meliorating prin
ciples, the rational plau of rignts, and the
perteft system of republican legiflatioii
which it contains, Will, in spite of the ma
chinations of the harpies of despotic domi
nation, spread themselves throughout the
world, and imprint their indelible traits on
the mind of man. Whether the despots of
Europe annihilate it in France, or tail un
der its emancipat ng influence, the great
truths which it exhibits will never be obli
teratedfrom the minds of thofeunftiackled
men who can, and who dare to think ami
speak: Every line, every principle of this
noble fuperftrufture is replete with beau
ties, which the pen of the philosopher wii'
delight to unfoldâln proportion as igno

At firft view, this principle appears to em
brace too much ; but it is only in appear
ance and will vanilhon examination. Be
fore I proceed to elucidate this remark, ii
will not be amiss to difclaiin every idea ol
that abandoned, perverted fpec'es of equa
lity which the abettors of arbitrary puwei
inlinuate the French have eftablilhcd anion;,
themâAn equality which, accordiHg li

Condition like this would not be foundec

Let us endeavour to trace the inflitution!

of superior strength, who, cortfcious of his
superiority, takes, by force, what the other
had gained by his induilry : The strong
wan, before he reaches his hut, is met by
another stronger than himfelf, who robs
him of his plunder, and who, in his turn,
is met by the Itrongelt man in the whole

received from him âHere, then, we llop.
Neceflity obliged men, in a state of nature,
to unite themselves againli the depreda

this equality is founded in Nature, and ap

PHILADELPHIA.
Wednesday, Seplember 2j.
That immense number of waggonÂ®, feme
of them from far beyond the Alleghany, that
used to crowd Maiket-flreet at this season
of the year, are totally disappeared. We
are told that the drrets of Baltimore are
bow thronged with them ; and thus not
one of the lead ill confeqtiences of the de
flruÂ£tive yellow fever, is the chance of its
eventually turning,for a time, a considera

and occasioning many new connexions in a
rival city.
On Friday evening last. all the New-York

the contagion again took wing, and hat

The attempt of the F.nglifh miniflry to
withdraw the Grand Duke of Tufcany
from his neutrality inrefpeft totheFrench.
has excited a general indignation through
that l'ingdon). The 4th article of their
late treaty with Kulfia. is as follow:
" Their majeflies engage to unite all their
efforts to prevent other powers, not impli
cated in this war, from giving, on this oc
cation of connrfon concern to every civi
lized state, any protection whatever, di
rectly or indirectly, in cor.sequence of their
neutrality, to the commerce or property
of the French o-n the sea. or in the ports of
France." Thus have they faithfully en
tered into engagements to prevent, if pof
ible, any prince from securing to his fub
lettsthe bleflings of peace and commerce,
and have determined as far as in them lies,
to extend the horrors of war all over
Europe. Some curious manoeuvring in
this country, renders it suspicious that a
imilar game has been attempted here, but
without the wiflied for success ; the people
being yet matters of the government of the
United States, and not vice verja.
Some accounts from Europe fay, that
the island of Corsica has been delivered up
to the Spaniards, through the treason of
general Paoli.
By a late arrival at Boflon from Gibral

any jnnftion of the English and Spanifli

sickly. The French fleet was at Toulon 1
the English at Barcelona.âTheÃrit'fl fri

much fliattercd in an attion with a French
frigate.
" The citizens of the United States, &c.
lave been deceived by the publication of a

" Thus was the old worn in (who before

Extract of a letter from a gentleman whe
lately took a passage in the stage from
this city to the (outhward.
\Ve were (topped about (even rone!
from Baltimore by armed men, who used
us with every indignity, aud hatred indica
tive of malice propenj'e j they detained us
in the stages from 5 in the evening until 101
Che ensuing morning; during this interval,
one of those ruffians, who appeared to be I
a German, fiiapped his piece at one of out
party, whÂ« feeined inclined to leave the
Itage, with an apparent delign to go iÂ»
aniong the buflies near the road. Ihe
gu:ird, in their tender mercy, were pleased
to hand to us a piece of dry cheese on the
end of a pitch fork. After this quarantine,
we were permitted to go to Grays gar
dens, and there perforin another, for the
[pace of two days and nights."
Doctor Rustox, from long experience
in Europe, and other parts, recommends
che following as a fife and easy cure ot the
contagion now prevailing in Philadelphia-
- u As foori as a perfoil it seized with the
Fever, which is nfuully attended with chill,-
rfefs, pains in the bones, llead-aches, and
icknefs at rtornach, s he firft thing to be ta
ken is, (for a grown person) three grains
jf Tartar-Emetic. This soon creates a
plentiful difcliarge, hot only fibin the uo
mich, but from the held, the throat, the
liver, and eves from the intellines thctil-
Telves ; its operation is also generally fol
luwed by tv'o or more plentiiul discharges
tf the lower belly, the conference ot
which i s , that the person finds himfelf very
much relieved, and generally pafl'es a tole
rable night. The next day the following
purge is to be gi^en.âTake 4 ounces of
pulp of tsifiarinds, boil them in half a pint
bf water, strain it, and to 3 ounces of the
mixture add 3 drachms of nianra, and! 5
grains of the belt powdered rheubarb. Ot
this compound one half is to be take n
immediately, anil the remainder in halt
an hour, working it otf by drinking plen
tifully of water gruel, made of oatmeal
and a fufficient quantity of water. â No ani
mal food of any kind, or even broth, is tc
be eaten ; but ripe fruit and vegetable'
particularly potatoes and baked apples,
are to be indulged in to any amount the pa
tient pleases. The remaining part of the
.lire conlills in drinking plentifully of toli
water, barley water,either with or without
tigs or railins boiled in it, tamarind water ;
eatiflg tamarinds; or by a repetition of tilt
iurge, by which means the body is kept con
tantly open ; and irt taking a few powder:
of ten grains of nitre each, every three or
lour hours, in any of tbefe drinks or ii
balm tea."
It appears by the reports from the holpi
ral at Bush-Hill, that many of those whc
lave been removed thither, in the earl)
stage of the malignant fever have met with
r e ]ief: but that in molt of the cases where
:he disease has been mricli advanced, the
attempts to ufford assistance have provec
fruitlefs. The committee therefore re
â¡ ueft theif fellow citizens to apply for the
removal of such sick perfens as are intend
ed for the hospital, with as little delay a:
joflible, after it can be ascertained and cer
tified by a physician, that their disease is the
malignant feyer.

ro let a pregnant lady,on the point of being
delivered, quit Valenciennes, flie beings
perfori in whom he was interested.
The request was granted, and the com
mandant of Valenciennes only intended,
by hoilting the white flag, to m;:ke tin

She has been sent hither, and is the more

sirous to discover conspirators. I have r
very important conlj'iracy to couimunicats

" Have you received my letter? It you

bosom. Marat had only time to fay, "I
am dying."âHis ferrant entered the room
and made an alarm. People ran to his
afiiftance. This infernal Fury wt?n,t out
with audacity. She was flopped, but before
herfeizure bad time enough to have killed
herfelf, had that been her intention ; but
[lie did not. When told she would lose her
life upon the fcaffold, she looked upon the
guards with a malicious smile of mockery,
reckoning upon the fnccefs of the traitor
ous plots of Caen, and doubtless in hopes
to escape puuilhment. In the pockets of
this abominable woman were found 150
livres iii lilver, and 140 in aflignats; a let
ter addreffeei to Marat : a paftyort deli*
vered the Bth of April by the municipality of
Caen, her baptismal certificate, a gold
wat,ch ; a sheath of a knife hanging to her
neck, and a writing in the form ol' an ad
drels to the French people. She is about
25 years of aee. The afl'aflination of Ma
rat was only part of the execution of a.
deep plot that was to take plate the 14th
of July in the evening, with a view ef ef
feiting a counter revolution in Paris on the
annivcrfary of National Liberty.
members of the National Convention were
to be put to death, except those called in
triguers : to annihilate the new Conltiiu
ition, and leave the people deflitute of laws
in order te waste ihemfelves in anarchy.
The admirers of Marat have caused a me
lial to be firnck to his honour, inferibed 011
onefide, "To Marat, the friend of the
people, the destroyer of aristocracy." On
the reverse is the representation, of Pio
genes, with the cap of liberty on his head :
In one hand he hold'a lanthom, and with
the other he assists Marat to attend from
his hiding place, by meansof a trap-door.
The legend confilts of the following dia
logue â[Diogenes] " Friend Sans Culottes!
I have been looking for your arrival this
long time !" [Marat] Mankind perfe
cted Truth; I had 110 other place of re

Extract ftom the Minutes of the Synod of
Philadelphia, met at York-town, on the
28th day of August, 1793, and continued
by adjournment.
THE Synod of Philadelphia, taking into
their molt serious consideration the very
critical situation of the affairs of these Unit
ed States, at this eventful period ; the
great degree of infenlibility in matters of
religion that has prevailed in all ranks of
men amonglt us, notwithstanding the many
great judgments and deliverances, which,
as a nation, we have heretofore experi
enced ; the prevalence of infidelity, and
the negleit and Oppolitfon dilcovered by
many with regard to the jnftitiitions of
chriltianity, and the mediation of our Lord
and Saviour Jesus Christ taking also into
view,'the alarming ahd iricrealing judg
ments of God that are abroad in the earth,
the convulsions that have taken place in
F.urope, and the probability that our guilty
country may be involved in similar calami
ties unanimously agreei 1 , in appointing
Thursday, the 24th day of Prober next,
to be obfervea as a day of falling and pray
er, by all the churches under their care.
The Synod most earneflly exhort and en
join upon persons ot all ranks in our com
munion, to lay a fide on that day their usual
bulinefs, and unite in humble and earneiV
Inpplicstions to the throne of grace, thro*
oui divine Mediator, that God would im

THE LILLY OF THE VALLEY.
THE fun's last finking beam was seen,
Dancing upon the distant hills;
The flocks had left the dewy greenâ
Â» And foftly climb'd the warb'ling rills
When to enjoy the pensive hour,
I ftray'd along the sorest, flow,
And there beneath a willowy bow'r,
I 'fpyed the Valley's Lilly blow.
Sweet was the scent it shed around ;
Its silvery cups were fteep'd in dew,
But not one flowret near was found-
Damp was the flude in which it grew
Before the nfing of the fun,
I pluck'd an opening rose that morn,
But now its blushing tints were gone,
And al' the tender leaves were torn.
No more I lov'd the beauteous bud,
I cast it, faded, from my bread,
And bending o'er the clovery sod,
I thus the lonely flower addrefs'd :
" Lilly, so fair, why here,alone,
" Dost thou delight thy sweets to spread
" Why lov'ft to blossom all unknown,
" Beneath the willows cold damp shade
" The rujlic eye that roves this way,
" Greets not thy beauties with a smile
" Nor will thy sweets a charm convey
" To the rude heart of boijlerous toil.
" Oh, hadft thou bloom'd in fomeparterre
" Thy leaves had borne a fnowyer hue ;
" And beauty's hand with tender care,
" Had cropt the weeds that round thee
grew.
â¢' To cultivate thy rich perfume,
" The fun had lent a kindlier ray,
" But all-negleEled dost thou bloom,
" Aad all-negleSed wilt decay!"
I ceas'dâand pity's ready tear
Flow'd fact; when foft as zephyrs play,
A voice, low whispering, met mine ear,
And thus, it sighing feem'd to fay :
*'Whyfhouldft thou wi(h an humble flow'r,
" That loves the silent desert's gloom,
"To fliine the idol of an hour,
" And then to meet a lhameful doom.
" I enry not the lot of those
" Who fleurifh in the gay parterre,
" While F.iere in quiet I repose,
" Nor f\,ve!l'd with pride,-nor funk with
fear.
'The fenfclefs hum of emptypratfe,
" And cruel flattery I resign,
'' Nor alk a more diftinguifli'd place,
" While peaceful solitude is mine.
" For well I know the transient joy
" A flower can give, would (oon be pad,
" Who moll delir'd, would foonell cloy,
" And I be thrown away at lafl!
" See what return yon rose bud meets,
" This morn thou took'lt it from the
item,
" To thee it gave its earliest sweets,
" Bedeck'd with many an orient gem.
'' Awhile it spread its blulhes bland,
" And fried its fragrant odours round ;
" But soon as faded, thy rude hand,
" Ungrateful, call it on the ground.
" Oh, had Hie lov'd to kiss the gale,
" Or drink Aurora's crimson beam
" Within some lhadowy winding vale,
" Or by some rulhing, frothy stream;
" Then had (he \o perfection grown,
" And by no thankless spoiler priz'd,
" Her charms, 'tis true, had r.e'er beei
known,
" But then, they ne'er had been defpie'd

The AMERICAN'S PRAYER for
FRANCE.
ETERNAL source of glorious power
And sovereign Lord of boundless space
Deign, Monarch of the Ikies, to Ihower
TlJ'y blessings on the Gallic race !
Great Preiident of Nature's frame,
Th<.u art the only king we own ;
We own thy power, we bless thy name,
And bow before thy heavenly throne.
Thou did'ft exill ere time began,
And thou wilt reign till time's no more
Protector of the Rights of Man,
Fair Freedom's foils thine aid implore
Grant, mighty Ruler of the world,
Tint France may yet enjoy repose,
And not be to deftru&ion hurl'd,
But triumph o'er her hods of foes.
Lord, in her cabinet preside ;
In thee her warriors firmly trail,
In thee her chosen sons confide.
Her heroes brave, her rulers just.
To thee we raise our humble voice,
Thy great and glorious name adore:
Lord, make thy chosen race rejoice
And grant that KINGS may reigr
no more.

Domejiic Intelligence.
Bofloii, Sept. 12. A certain writer ir
the Centinel has twice presumed to addrefi
:itizen Genet, as fpeakrng the fentimenti
if the " real republicans of Boston." He
las the effrontery to profane the charadlei
3f sthis refpe&able clafa of citizens, and
meanly attempts to Ihroud himfelf undei
heir patronage, to vilify and abuse the
minister of our ally. The real republi
cs'! difuwn the sentiments, and reprobate
the man, who dares insult the French na
tion thro' this medium. Such addreffe!
not speak the minds of the real repub
licans among us, but are effufions of that
rancorous temper which we fee daily ope
rating among the enemies not only to the
freedom of France, but also to the peace,
Kanpinefs, and prosperity of the United
States. Such effufions are the voice oi
toryism, proclaimed by the organs of aris
tocracy, and issuing through corrupted ve
hicles of intelligence. Real republican!
speak a language more decent and refpeÂ£-
able. They conceive that the welfare ol
America cannot be promoted by the nu
merous in lulls which are daily offered tc
the minister of France. They feel an at
tachment to the cause of our ally, and
are aware of the arts and manoeuvres prac
tised by the combined powers of tory refu
gees, Britilh agents, and such like cha
radiers, who infect our country, and whofs
able nee would be cheaply purchased al
millions of pounds flerling. The real Re
publicans are desirous to leave the dispute
(it any fublifts) between the President and
the French Plenipotentiary, to be fettled
by the authority ef the United States in
C. Â»ngrÂ«fs assembled. They despise the
mode made use of by certain designing per
sons, to injure the reputation of the mi
nister of I'ranee in the opinion of the
American public ; and notwithstanding
their frequent profeffions of friendfhip to
the cause of France,or to ourPrefident, yet
their interference appears solely calculated
to widen tlie breach between these cha
ra&en; and to Art at variance the two
nations. The'real Republicans are anxious
to remain in peace and neutrality : They
deprecate the resentment of Frarce, which
these men appear afliduous to hritig dowr
upon us; knowing that should the com
bined powers succeed in their wicked
measures against that nation, the citizens
of the United- States would soon be furo
moned to attend the funeral of Americar
freedom.
Baltimore, Sept. 14. There are no twc
writers 011 the fubjedt of the contagiuus
licknefs, in Philadelphia, that seem tc
agree with each other âOne fays, " f
arose from landing some damaged coffee'
âanother fays " from putrid hides"â;
third " from stagnant waters, filth
in the ftreetsand backyatds"âand a/ourtl
will have it " that it is occasioned b;
n P cellars, moving old foundations o
human cxcrements, or by permitting bu
rying grounds, tanneries, and flaugbte)
bouses within the streets and alleys of j
populous town, or even of a country vil
lage.''âWhen there are Inch a variety ol
opinions on the real cause of this awfu!
calamity, it is difficult to declare the true
cause. If, however, we recoiled that the
fever firit appeared in Water-street, tipor
a due recolledion of all the nuisances thai
ill judged street is fubjeft to, we are o!
op.nion that the mortality has been in :
great degree occasioned by putrid exhala
tions from the docks of the city. It is
well known those docks are the recepta
cles for evety kind of filth, such as, humar
Drdure, dead dogs, cats, &c. &c. thrown
into them every night, to be carried ofi
by the morning's tide, and which Jometima
remain to be exposed to the fun till I or 2
o'clock in the afternoon, which, in the
dog-days, an easterly wind fptinging up.
inuft undoubtedly convey a very infectious
and deleterious body of air thro' the
alleys and other openings, which lead from
the docks into Water-street, which being
very narrow, and little or no conveyance
for the foul air to pass off; the conse
quence has been that immediate inferior
took place on those people whe retidec
in Water-street, and the narrow ilreets ir
its vicinity, and it is fully believed this
dangerous disorder may be traced to fuel
a wharffs of this city an
built, generally, to the very edge of tlx
channel. It is high water, as in other
places on this coast, twice every hours :
whether from thia circumstance, any efflu.
via of infe&ion worth mentioning can arifc
frora the docks, is left to the determination
of all, who choose to fee things as thej
really are. J

The MEMORIAL and PETITION oj
the Convention oj Mero-Di(lriÂ£l,
(Territory South of the Ohio.)
WE, your memorial ids, being regu
larly chosen and fully authorised
by the citizens of Mero, to represent the
situation of our country, addrtfs you, fir,
amidst dangers which threaten our total
dissolution, without your aid.
We omit to fpÂ»ak of the outrages this
frontier has fuffered from the infoltnce anc
barbarity of the Creeks and Cherokees
ever since the firit eftablilhment of out
settlement of Cumberland.
We rcqueft only to call your attentior
to the lift of the killed and wounded since
the treaty of Holfton, amounting to ont
hundred and seventeen, which we enclose,
This lift proves how lender a tie, upor
these barbarous people are treaties, with
out the restraint of coercion and fear.â
The loss of our property we name not.
What succour has been granted, though
liberal, each day's melancholy experience
(hews to be inadequate to the proteftior
of our lives. The despair of our fellow,
citizens causes a daily increase of popula
tion to the Spanilh government.
Long experience emboldens us humbly
to suggest, that while our hand# are tied,
and the enemy permitted to proceed with
out retaliation, we cannot flatter ourfelve!
with any bounds to our calamities. How
far it may, in general, be expedient to re
concile this enemy with presents and re
wards, is not for us to decide; but wc
cannot help deploring, that, with refpefl
to this country, such treaties appear tc
have an evil tendency.
That our fufferings proceed not from
any known provocation on our fide, wt
appeal to the father of truth and mercy:
âTherefore, in full confidence of your
humanity and jullice t we pray, that we
m-jy be further affiled to ftipport tint
frontier, which in our present iituation is
found to be in the titmoil danger. We fur
ther petition, that to awe our enemies, this
government may be permitted to retaliat*
upon the invaders and aggrelfors, or to de
mand them from their towns, if ihey pur
sue these infuflerable violences : or, in cafe
they refufe to deliver them rip, that we
may have the fan&ion of public authority
to do otufclves jultice ; for we know not,
in our present situation, to what despair
the people may be driven.
