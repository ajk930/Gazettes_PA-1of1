CIT I ZEN,
WE are deputed by. and have the hc**nr

your a; ival in o. r country, wt. have te<.r:

reprefeiitative of a nation ftrugg in;* i>i tite
glo kiln cause of freedom and 1 insanityâ
of a nation animated by 1<
c<i lpenial with our own, no' 'o exiite tin
v -rnicft fympnthy of frieiidihip and tx
ultation.
It is tins we feel the diftretfe? of youi
country : we lament the blood of patrioi
heroes, and the miseries entailed on the in
nocent bv the ol'ftinacy of pride and the
c ueltv of ambitionâBus liberty it too in
v nable not to be purchafid it any price ;
and we are not to damp the joyinfpired or
this occasion, by recalling to m.ud, vhal
onr own liberties have cod lis. or the im
menlV ftcrifi â¢eÂ» made by jour countrymei
on the altar of freedom.
We confidently trull, that tmd-?r th'
gu'danee of a benign, altho' unseen arm
tie politic J circumdances of mankind art
rapidly meliorating and improving. Thai
the republic of France is made a most dif
tinguilied indrument in this grest, thi
gÂ»(flike work,and we Ihould do violence t<
our feelinjs u ere we not to seize an occa
fio'i like the present to mamfeft to the
world how mu.h ue are i lterefted in the
â¢lawn at" univerlal happiness, in the triiimpl
of liberty, and in Its tertain confluence,
the peai e and prosperity of nations.
Through the timely aid Â®f France, theft
United states have boen brought to the
full enjoyment of the blefiings of civil li
be; ty.â the Cervices ot vour countrymei
in the hour of our diftref, were t'ill nna
and were chearlully rendered, and tho
despots may ablureUy claim the merit oi
them, we know better to whom the senti
ment of gratitude is to be directed ; ant
we ardently will) that sentiment to reniaii
indelibly imprefled on the hearts of oui
reinoteit pollerity.âWe tecognife, in till
defenders of their own the defenders of out
rights ; and in the patriots of France, thf
benefactors of America.
We this day, tender to you our heartsâ
and thro' you to your nation our varn
and undlfgwifed uffeftiorÂ«âHe affiir'd, Sii
we are both re. dy and willing to render
you every ferv.te and aftillame conlifteni
with our reciprocal welfare and with t'ie
duty we owe our country ânay morr
exultingly would we thus ficrifice a libe
ral portion of our cleared interells, coulc
there result on your behall'an adtejiate ad
vantage.
The voice of our government has thro'iti
ex<?cut.ve declared the nentr.i iiy of theft
United States as relative to all acts of hof
tiltiy. We regard thatfacred voice with
attentionâBut no one is a stranger to the
part all good men take in your revolution,
As the question relates to sentiment anc
principles there is no neutralltjâThe vir
ttioas and the wife thro' all rank? of fbci
ety are enlided with you. It is vice, igno
ranee and cowardice that alone oppose the
empire of truth and independence or fhrinli
from thf common cause of human n a turn-
Firm a;'d deady friends you will ever fine
in the i epublic.ui sons of Columbia, whose
mod earned prayer to the great Arb ter o!
jia:ions is, and will be, that the Iberty o)
both countries may remain incorruptible
and immortalâThat the world may fee ir
their example and felicity the path of faci
al improvement and the meftiniable prize
of virtuous exertion.
Permit us, Â« orthv cit'zen, to express tt
you our high elleem for your anc
character, our fincered wiflies in genera
for your personal happiness and prosperity,
and in particular, that you may long fulfil
the duties of your exalted dation so as t<
merit the approbation of) our own heart anc
to feeure the plaudit of your conflituents.

FEW principles, at 3ny period of the
world, have ever been more perverted
and diflorted, t-han liberty and equality
have been since the late revolution in
France. The French have avowedly
taken them for the bads of their republic ;
and, finely, a better foundation a repub
lic was never bwilt upon, than that which
fccures equal freedom and equal rights tc
â 11 mankind. The enemies ot the French,
however, are eternally laying hold of
these terms, and are writhing and twilt'yig
-hcin tor the purpose of rendering con
emptible that gallant nation, at a time
when Ihe is glorioudy (Iruggling for the
rights of mankind. Freedom, fay they,
is only a li e ice for the unprincipled rab

of all subordination. It is dividing, fiy

the poor ; and, in ffiort, authorizing

is, to preserve ''a balance of power.' 1 He

have advifedit ? Is it pollible that such fen
tiilients can be in unison with the feelings
of true republican*! fill ? Is it pollible torth Â£
friends and defenders of this country, ai a
republic, to be alike friendly and impartial
to all the"powers at war, in Europe, when
there is such a felf evident and wicked
combination of the molt powerful despots
a 'iinil one republic, even if the French
nation had never afforded us any affiltance
vhatever ? But when we conlider that it
"was at the expence of French blood ai:d
treasure that we were so happily emanci
pated from British tyranny, how can any
true friend to this country and republican
if n, be impartial to so unequal and unjufl
a contelt ?

that it is utterly impossible for me to obey

Germany to appoint a regent for the re
public of France ? Might he not with as
much propriety appoint a regent for the

The following speech was delivered by
Gen. GALBAUD, to thecrew of the Ju
piter, at New York, 011 Saturday, the
10th of Ault, 1793.
Brothers <b Friends,
The man that is capable ot betraying his
country, is unworthy to allill at the feaft
of liberty and equality.
Citizens, If you fufpeft me of so hien
ous a crime, you lhould be the firfl to pre
vent tlie pi efence of a Traitor disgracing
this august feaft.âYour silence convinces
me that you render me the jmtlice that I
deserve of you. You know that the itfue
of an event fliould not criminate a man.but
only the intention by whicli he was guided.
You know that 011 the unfortunate 20th
and 21ft of June, the love of the country
alone dictated my action, as I only wiflied
to deliver St. Domingo from the power 01'
two men, whose crimes are beyond coni
parifon. Y n u know that 1 yielded to your
own heartfiltin lignation which would not
permit you tu bear any longer the triumphs
of the enemies of liberty and equality. ,
Exulting in an approving conscience,
which will always rifefuperior to thejudg
mentsofmen viewing ai ound me brothers,
friends, who will not be enraged at my ot
fering them the language of truthâwho
will never debase themselves so much as to
Salter vice jlt I fay, in be
holding thetrnÂ« friends of liberty, that I
forget the piriVtutions I now fulT'i"under,
and it jj partaking of the general joy. that
I now pronounce cite oath which is deep
ly engraved on my repulican heart. I swear
th?" X will t>e faithful to the republic ; that
I wui maintain liberty and equality, and il
ever the public again employs me, that i
will (lie radier than abandon my poll.
GALBAUD.
By the schooner Indnftry, we learn,
that Anx-Cayes now exhibits a fiebe al
moft'as diftrelliug as that at Cape Fran
cois. Upwards of one hundred white:
have been put to death by the mulattoe
âand every day produces frefn instance;
of plunder and bloodlhed.
Various particulars appear under the
head of the National Convention pro
ceedings to M ty 30, relative to the anti-re
publican ir.furgents. Several small towns
that had been seized on by them had been
retaken : and great numbers of theft
people, milled by the refractory prielts
and old nobles, had returned to their
duty. They were chiefly dangerous in
the country from Rochfort to St. Ilorent,
and meditated freih attempts upon that
Sine. The chief difalter 011 the lide of the
patriots seems to have been near Fonte
najr, owing to the National Gendarme;
not charging according to orders, in con
sequence of which, part of the Artillery
was taken, but 110 other material lots.
Saturday, being the ever memorable
10th of Augult, the fame was observed a?
a day of Jubilee by the French fl:et ir
the harbour of New-York: âat fun-rife,
the ships of war displayed a profufion ol
colours of all nationsâÂ«nd at 12 o'clock, a
!eu-de-joie was hi ed throughout the whole
fleet. The Auitrnan flag bore a confpi
cuous situation. but those of the nation
war with the French, were all turned Us
fide down.

Philad. 1793.
From the INDEPENDENT CHRONtCLS.
Mejfrs. Adams & Larkin,
AT present it is only necefTary to ob
fcive upon a lingle paragraph in the
publications of PAdFlcus,a writer in Mr.
Fenno's paper, and reprinted (by request in
the Columbian Ccntinel.) One reason he
offers why we ought not to comply with
our treaty with France, is, that it might
possibly set upon us the numerous tribes ol
Indians along our whole interior frontier,
atting under the influence and direction ol
England and Spain.
It is curious to o .serve the art an " inge
nuity of writer? when arguing againlt the
French, or againil the fulfilment of out
treaty with that nation. It seems, by this
writer, we are now to break our treaty
with France, \jnder the apprehension of om
being engaged in an Indian war, carried
on under the " diredlion and influence oi
the British nation."
Pray, Mr. Pacificus, which i? the most
ruinousto the U. States, to break our trea.
ty with France or demand our forts of the
English, agreeable to the.r treaty, in or
der to prevent the hostilities of the In
dians, under " their diredlion and influ
ence ? "Do you suppose that the French
will be fatisfied on this point with your
fophidry, or that you can blind the eyes ol
the Convention by arguments so puerile ?
Have the Englilh held our frontiers for fa
mnny years with a design to prevent our
ever afiiiling our allies ? Or has lord
Dorcheller given you this official infor
mation, with instructions to retail it in
all the hackneyed papers of your party !
Now, Mr. Pacificus, you are mightily a
fraid of an Indian war, when France it
brought into view ; but where have been
your f.ars for many yea's pall, while ad
mitting a combined body of land jobber
to involve this country in all the horrors
and expence of the war you now so feri
oufly deprecate ! Why did you not come
forward with your publications, and dif
countenance an Indian war, at a period
when it became so formidable as to require
an extra duty of two and an half per cent,
on the trade, to support it ? Why was
not your patriotism alarmed on the report
of a committee of v'ongrefs, which has
laid two fefiions almolt totally unnoticed,
notwithllanding it wÂ® evident, that thou
sands and tens of thousands, nay mi'liona
of dollars, were expended and wafted by
mismanagement and neglect ? Was you,
Pacificus, so deeply ingulfed in the vortex
of speculation, that you could not elabo
rately descant on the horrers of an Indian
war, when our brave troops were repulsed
and fiaughtered near the villages of the
Miami ! Or was the reputation qf those
that were concerned m this difgraccful bu
nefs, more sacred, than a treaty iigned by
our ambaflador in France, and ratified by
Jie Congrels of the United States ?"
Mention not, Sir, an Indian war, this
being a bunnefs which many in govern
ment ought to blush at, as it is reasonably
conjedhired that tâ >is infamous war, origi
nated among a set of land jobbers, who
wish to acquiie an immense territory at
the expence of the revenue and the earn
ings of the indultrious merchant, trade!
man and farmer.
A further argument which you offei
why we ought to break our treaty 'with
France is, " that the United States art
iellitute of a naval force.', But if you
was at the head of our financiering de
partment, you would know, that more
money has been expended in fut le opera
t ons, and peculating contrails, in carrying
>ii the Indian war, >han would have fur
lifted the United Slates, long before this
:ime, with a navy fufficient to cop with
iny maritime power in Europe : Provi
Jed you was at the" head of our finan
cing department, wii} r have you not
:>een as careful on this head, as to youi
' inllrumentality" in furnifmng means tc
Dank speculators ? Had this important
Ã¼bjeft been attended to, and a thorough
nveftigatiou taken place in the war de
partment as to the immense sum, needless.
y expended in In ian expeditions.Pacifi
cus would now blulh to maks an afferti
an, that the United States were deflitutj
if a naval force, or pretend to offer this a;
\ reason why we ought to break a treaty
ivith a nation on whose friendfliip the fu
ture glory, honor u elfare,commerce, agri
:uhure and manufactures of America ef
[entially depend.
One remark more will clofc the prefeni
:>blervations. Pacificus *fter endeavour
ing in three elaborate publications 10 provi
that we are not bound by treaty to aflill
I ranee ((hould they require it) conclude:
with hefe w ids, And the Prtfidenl
ivas in every view fully jullified in pro
lousicing that the duty and interest of the
United States dictated a neutrality in thi
â var " Do you fuppofe.Pacificus, that thi
Pr lident will thank you for bringing hii
proclama'ion as a voucher to fan&ior
your principles? Is the '-neutrality''
recommended by the President founded
jpon the principles you advocate, viz.
:hat we *re not bound by any fubiillino
:reaty ? It is aa affront to the PieliJent
to suppose this was the design of his pro
clamation, or that you was deputed the
herald to proclaim the principles upon
which it was issued.
I forbear to enlarge on the idea, as I
im convinced this illullrious charaÂ£tÂ»r,
retains too high a sense of the honor ol
ihe dates, and feels too deeply intereftet]
in the honor of this country, to blast its
reputation by jesuitism and sophistry ;
mote especially would he attempt to ex
plain away a treaty with a nation, whose
rienddiip a d martial prowess he so parti
cularly experienced, at a t me, when the
:roops of France were led by him hand in
band with those of America, into tht
lield of battle, and whose blood in confe
rence of his commands, was mingled in
ane current, in defence of the cause o!
freedom and America Far he will re
member, nor can the idea ever he oblite
-ated from his memory, That the foldieri
rf France were atlive in placing the Lau
rels of viElory on his head
