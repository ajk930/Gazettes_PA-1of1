The leader of the party was apprehended, an<
from his papers it appeared that they were al
receiving the fame pay as the followers of thi
princes at Coblent?.
Ths remaining fifteen millions of afiignats, c
the twenty-five due to the fund of extiaordina
lies, were voted.
The afTembly was informed, that M. Liqui
efki, appointed to negociate with the dey of Al
giers, had executed his mifiion with the greatef
success. The dey received him with distinguish
ed marks of favor, made him (if by his fide, am
that he might feel the full value of an honor ne
ver conferred upon an envoy before, defjred hin
to write to the king, that he had received his en
voy like a friend. He exprefTed his concerns so
the troubles that agitated France, hoped the;
were nearly at an end, and aflured M. Liquie/ki
that he fiiould think no facrifice too much ti
prove his attachment to rhe Frcnch nation am
the king, to whom he also sent a present of thre
horses.
The grand matter of Malta, on the firft intima
tlon of a probable rupture between France am

M. la Cepede was elected president.
The sum of 1,371,728 livres was voted for thÂ«
bread of the army, and 1,220,960 livres for for

Nov. 29. The decree against the non-juring
clergy was lefumed j and an article, formerly pro
posed by M. Albitte, for allowing them to hin
houses, and perform public worship under the in
/pe&ion of the civil magistrates, was rejetted, or
the ground that clergy and l.ity were equallj
bound to take the oath of fidelity to the conititu
tion, as a qualification to enjoy the rights secured
by it, and that the civic oath was a mere civic
obligation, and had nothing to do with religious
opinions.
The following article was added to the decree,
and the whole 01 dered to be immediately prefent
cd for the royal fandtion :
'* The national chuiches and oratories, ap
pointed for the wor/hip paid for by the state, can
not be employed for any other worship. Thoft
which the administrations shall declare unnecefia

priests, who, having refufed to take the cm<
&ath, are declared to be fufpe&ed of evil iriten
tionsagainft their country, and revolt against th'
aws. This decree does not prejudice the right
of the protestants of the confetti n of Augfburgh
who enjoy the free exercise ot their worship in \.U
departments of the Upper and the Lower Rhin?
Doubt, and Jura."
A melTage from the king informed the afiembl
of the appointment of M. Delaflerf, to the foreign,
and M. Cahier de Gerville to the home depart
ment of administration*
M. Deleflart gpve an account of the appli< a
tions made to the twpeior the elcil.i
Treves and Mayence, for the d'fuerfion of th
emigrants, and the hopes of success which ! ma
jelly entertained. He also stated, that his majeft
was going to make such changes in the diploma
tic body, as he trusted would give confidence t
the public, and the negociations for indemnif
ingfuch of the German princes as were deprive
of feudal rights by the revolution, weie to b
pursued with vigour.
The consideration of M. propofi
tion on the measures to be taken at foreign court
with refpeft to the emigrants, was resumed.
It was supported by M. Ifnard, in a fpeec
vhich the aflembly ordered to be printed, and de
:r<ed in the following terms :
" The national adembly decrees, that a deputa
:ion of *4 of its members shall wait upon the kin?
:o communicate to him, in the name of the affcm
&4y, its solicitude on the dangers that threaten th
:ountry, by the perfidious combinations of French
men, armed and embodied without the kingdom
and of those who devise plots within it, or cxcit
the citizens to revolt against the law ; and to de
:lare to the king, that the nation will fee witl
"atisfadlion all wife measures that the king cai
:ake for the purpose of requiring the electors o
Treves and Mayence, and the biihop of Spire
conformably to the rights of nations, to disperse th
alTemblages of French emigrants ; that with th
fame confidencc in the wisdom of such measures
the nation will fee the neceffarv troops afTemble*
to compel those princes to refpedfc the law of na
tions by force of arms, if these alTemblages should
continue ; and finally, that the national assem
bly has thought it its duty, to make this solemn
Jeclaration, to the end that the king may prove
.. vfucttti cumnrfunicjrtrons or thb imprefiive
mealure, to the diet of Ratifbon, and all the
:ourts of Europe, that his intentions, and those
of the French nation, are the fame. 7 *
The fame deputation will represent to the king,
that the afi'embly considers, as one of the molt
efficacious measures to this effect, the speedy
termination of the riegociations for the indemni
ties due to the princes who pofTefied feudal rights
in Alsace. it will likewise stale the necetfity of
making changes in the diplomatic body, thÂ© de
fe&ive organization of which has been the cause
of so many delays.
M. Vaublanc proposed a form of the mefTage
to be presented to the king with the above de
cree, which was adopted.
In the evening fitting, M. Dumas stated, that
:he author of an incendiary paper at Lyons ex
horted the citizens to infurredtion and the murder
if their magittrates. Referred to the executive
>ower.
A number of addrefTes were read, exprefiing
ipprobation of the decree against the emigrants,
ind hopes that the king would be induced, on
nore mature consideration, to fandtion it.
LONDON, Dec. 6.
ExtraSf of a letter from Avigr.on y Nc*v. 15.
â¬i Peace is again restored to this unhappy coun
ty. The butcher, Jourdan, was apprehended
by Bigonnet the younger, a petfon for whose head
he had offered a reward. In his flight from
Avignon towards Entraigneis, he was pursued by
Bigonnet, with a party of horse. On finding him
felf on the point of being overtaken, he threw
himfelf into the river Sogues, where it was at least
ten feet deep. Bigonnet followed him. He fir
ed a pistol, but miffed, and received a blow on the
breast, which struck him from his horse. The
reft of the pursuers coming up, and plunging also
into the river, he was taken and conduced to A
vignon, where the people were with difficulty re
drained from tearing him in pieces. Peytavia,
Mainville, Tournal, Lecuyer, Raphel, and 18 of
the principal afl'afiins, are also taken."
Extra?} of a letter from Lubeck, Nov. 24.
" From the delay which the EJe&or of Saxony
has manifefted in his acceptance of the hereditary
:hrone of Poland, it is easy to perceive that rhere
|&s been some obstacle in the way, which obfta
:le can proceed from none but the Court of Ruf
-la. They are generally peifuaded at Warsaw,
:hat the Empress is far from content with the
:hanges wrought in the Constitution by the revo
ution of the month of May, a Constitution which
he guaranteed at the time of the partition 3 and
t is thought that Sweden, at present linkeo with
he Cabinet of Peterfburgh, unites in the views
vnich the latter may have with regard to this bu
inefs. It is even supposed that the affairs of Po
and form a particular objedfc of the treaty of al
iance concluded between the two northern Courts,
To far that one of the articles concerns the sup
port of the ancient Constitution of Poland, efpe
:ia!ly the right of choosing a King at every va
cancy of the throne. They remember, on this
jeeafion, the former pretentions of Sweden at the
ixpence of Poland, and the time when those two
ountries bad but one Sovereign. However, he
hat as it may, the Ele&or, of Saxony wishes tc
earn, by means of negotiations, the true meanirg
i*f Tome articles of the Constitution ; which ne
gotiations are afterwards to be followed up bj
others touching the Pacta Conventa. These de
ays, therefore, will come very apropos, and give
he Court of Dresden time to discover the final in
eitions of Russia. In the interim we learn, thai
> oland seeks the support of the Court of Vienna
M. Woyra, its Minister to the Emperor, about Â«
naftth ago, not only formally notified the change;
Â«%ich the King and the Republic had though
nroperto make on account of the Constitution o
Poland, but he was at the fame time charged tc
"oHeit the intervention of that Monarch to preveni
?ny neighboring power from opposing those ar
.angements which Poland judged neceflary to en
sure its happiness, and to urge the Ele&or of Sax
ony to accept of a throne ottered to him by a fre<
:tnd independent nation. Hitherto the Court o
Vienna has given no answer to its communica
i*on ; from whence we infer, that that Court is
unwilling to explain itfelf before it has learnt the
intentions of the other Courts with whom it it
connected. In the delicate situation, therefore,
n which the other powers stand with regard tc
Russia, the death of Prince Potemkin is an in
i 'dent, if not of the last importance, at least of a
mature to raise various conje&ures, both as to the
r'ntinuation of the ancient system of the Ruffian
Cabinet, and a change in its political connec
tions. We well know that it was not on the bell

of the latter in favor of the Porte had very neai

The States of Holland have made a fettlemeni
ifpon the newly-married Hereditary Princels, thÂ«
fifterof her Royal Highness the Duchess of York.
An annuity of 30,800 florins, something lefsthan
15,000!. sterling, has been fettled upon her, and
in a manner thus handsome. The adts of ail the
States, binding themselves to the payment oi
their quota, have been presented to her Highnefc
in gold boxes by deputations from each State.
The province of Holland has also made a prelent
to the Prince of 25,000 florins, and that of Frife
land to the Princess of 6000 ducats. The fever
provinces have fettled upon the Prince an annuity
of 36,000 florins, payable to him till his acceihon tc
the Stadtholderlhip, and then to the Princess foi
hej life. The offices held by the Prince bring him
18,000 florins, annually, and these sums, with his
Epergne, make about 800,000 florins of income
for their HighnefTes, which may be ftatcd at about
75,000!. Engli/h.
Hague, Nov. 30. The Republic have made
overtures for an alliance with the Emperor, foi
which procedure three weighty reasons may be as
signed :
1. The Republic is to discharge the German
troops.
2. Circumstances have made it neceflary tc
fend troops to the Weft-Indies.
3. The Dutch army is so weak, that it is even
inefficient to garrison those places properly,
which it is almost impoflible to leave without gar
risons.
The finances of Holland are in a pitiable state,
nearly as much so as those of France. Thi*
wretched state of them afforded an unanswerable
reafo'n for the discharge of the German troops,
which, to the number of about 5600, cost near
three millions of florins per annum. This great
and inconvenient expence the Republic would
probably have endeavored to sustain, had not these
troops incensed those towns where they were quar
tered, and given cause for frequent complaints
a gain ft them on the part of the Magistrates j to
which is to be added, that the national soldiery,
either through jealousy, or some other motive,
never viewed them in a favorable light. This
discharge of troops at this critical time, whether
voluntary or by compulsion, certainly takes from
rne Republic one cf its principal means of de
fence, and leaves it, as it were, unprote&ed. The
Stadtholder, confldering thtir critical situation, a
bout the end of October obfervea to the States
General, (l that he considered an alliance with
the House of Austria not only as a desirable ob
ject, but as a thing which the unfavorable times
and the force of circumstances rendered indif' en
fable -j that, in consequence, and in executing
his duty, he intreated their High Mightinefles to
take the fubjedt into their confederation, and tc
determine in their wisdom what part they may
think proper to adopt ort the fubjeft." The
States General viewed the fubjedt in the fame
light as the Stadtholder, and accordingly sent ofl
a dispatch to M. Van Haefien, their AmbafTadoi
at the Court of Vienna, to inform him of theii
intention. The affair is begun, and promises tc
fuccec<J. It is, however, that we are no
Numb. 32.
without fear, that the Emperor, although inclin.
Ed 10 comradt this alliance, will previoofly make
ufe'of' ifs and but: ; for it leldom happens, th.it
one Power Connects itfelf with another, merely
lor the honor of prote&ing and defending it.
Another circumstance added weight to the pro
posal which the Stadtholder made to the A/Tem
bly of their High MightinerTes. In the course of
last summer, a correfportdence was discovered be
tween the fugitive patriots and the malecdntents
of Liege and Brabant. Their plan contained val
combinations, ps.-haps profound, but decidedly
alarming. The Stadtholder immediately endea
vored to prevent the evil, by trying quietly to
frufhate the measures of the discontented. He
thought he should succeed, by pointing out to the
fugitives the pofiibility and the means of return
ing to their country. For ihis purpose he applied
to M. Rendoip, a Burgo-mafter at Amsterdam (
who undertook to write to the principal emigrants.
This he did, and the negotiation was begun ; but
ihe pretensions of the patriots were fd unreasona
ble, the conditions upon which they would con
sent to return so as to put an end to
the buftnefs. An aukward circumstance, how.
ever, intervened ! the King of PruUia was in
formed of the negotiation. He soon exprefl'ed hia
surprise to the States General, and exhorted them
maturely to confiJer what they were about, that
they might avoid the imputation oflevity or im
prudence in so feiious an affair. This circum
stance putting a flop to the negotiation, which,
however, is perhaps but suspended, adds much
force to the reasons which may be in favor of an
alliance with Aultria, and which induced thÂ«
Stadrholder to bring ic upon the carpet.

rowed considerable sums at Genoa, on the cre

Frankfort, Nov. 14. The apparent freedom
as the king of France's determinations since his
acceptance of the constitution has wrought a
wonderful change in the minds of various poten
tates in Germany and the Empire, in favour of
the revolution, and has in a great measure damp
ed the hopes of the emigrants. The several
Germanic courts, in their individual capacity,
carefully avoid any fleps that might be construed
into hoftil designs against the present govern
ment in France. The Prince of NafTau, lately
alked leave of the Landgrave of Hefle Darm
stadt to have fix cannon call at his foundery in
Manheim for the use of the French princes;
which was peremptorily refufed. The greatelt
part of the emigrants begin already to fee that
they have beendeluded from their country upon
falfe or precarious grounds. Alfembled in
crowds at Worms, Coblence, and other places, it
is with difficulty they can procure lodgings;â
many of them without money or resources, and
almost destitute of hope itfelf in a country where

Motion of Mr. Smilie, fecondedby Mr. Hoge
That it be resolved, That
WHEREAS the principle of represen

lion of the body mull become a mere founc
delusive to the ear but barren to the hope;

And whereas Every unnecessary appear â 
ance of myfteryin tranfacling the public af

people without which the bell political in

or moulder into anarchy since the hiftorj
of mankind demonstrates that the fame se

And whereas It is the right of every citi

public welfare diligently to examine anc
refolntely to discountenance every fymp
toni of a deviation from the nature anc
principles of the social compact which ha:
been eflablifhed to combine the powers anc
promote the general interest of the Ameri

citizens from hearing the debates of the

" It is really fickeniug to be in this place,
which seems to be the general resort of
every species of wretchednefi and misery ;
thousands of unfortunate people in a state
nf abject diflrefs. whom the hand of bene
volence finds itfelf unable to relieve. As
if these were not evils enough, the misera
ble emigrants are tormented with jealousy
and felf-love. If one of the French princes
does but whisper in the ear of an emigrant
in the morning, before night he afTume*
airs of consequence, and thus adds to the
mortification of his brethren.âWould to
â  od they were all princes, for these are a
fort of people that never want money,
whereas many of the deluded emigrants
are abfoluteiy pennylefs, ar.d without re
source, except in the charity of anexhauft

mod wretched. âIt is dangerous to look
too far forward into futurit l â but omens
Teem rather unfavorable. Whtle tome en
deavor to persuade the emigrants that allEurope is combining fcir th-'r fir-port
others assure them, and indeed the general
tranquility that prevails, is a convincing
proof, that they are upon the point of being
vmiverfally abandoned. On Thursday last.,
the Count d'Artpis had a long conference
with M. de Calonne, which ended in a
quarrel. The latter is about to quit the
emigrants, having acted the part of he Jly
upon the wheel. The Emperor it is certain

the air, it feeni< impracticable for them to
invade France."

Ab "raft of the Proclamation of the King of France,
Published New 12. [From the origina French.)
" His Majesty had long beheld with re
gret the emigration of vast numbers of citi
zens ;â¢ but after taking the proper steps to
preserve the good understanding between
France and foreign powers, and lecure the
frontiers from invasion ; he had thought it
best to adopt mild methods, in refpeft to
the recalling of those men, whom party
spirit and political opinions had baniflied
from their country. âHis proclamations,
and other steps he had taken, it was true,
had not produced the whole effect dt fired,
but yet had undeniably been productive of
fomegood, the emigration having visibly
abated, and several individuals returned tc
the kingdom ; whose number he flattered
himfeif would soon increase.âUnder the
influence of this hope, he had refufed his
fanftion to a decree of the Afiembiy deter
mining upon severe measures, as incompa
tible with his duty, with the interest of
the nation, and the principles of a free con
ftitution.âlf however, these lenient mea
sures should prove ineffectual, he would
exercise the prerogative he was inverted
with, and ftiffer the law to take its course.
He saw with pain the intentions of the Em
igrants to dilturb the public tranquility of
France, by assembling an armed force on
the frontiers, and preparing to overturn
those laws which he had fanftioned by his
acceptance âstrangely indeed must they be
deceived, who suppose the King can have
any other intention than that which he ha;
avowed in the face of the world, and would
make such a fuppolition the basis of their
hopes and their proceedings. The King
gives them a convincing proof of his free
agency, in not assenting to the measures ol
rigour decreed against them ; a proof thai
can neither be contradicted or misunder
stood and to doubt of the sincerity oi
his intentions, when he is at liberty to afl
as hepleafes, would be injurious in the ex
treme. âHis Majelty cannot fufficiently re
gret the disorders of the Kingdom, andfoi
some time part had entertained hopes thai
fear alone wai the cause of emigrationâthe emi
grants now have no right to talk of the
troubles of France, since they themselves,
by their absence, their plots, aud their ma
noeuvres, seem to be the principal cause ol
the remaining diforder.s. Let them noi
affect, therefore, to lament the neglect ot
infringement of the laws fmce they (the
emigrants) set the example of disobedi
ence, and refufe to acknowledge the com â 
bined will of the nation and of the king, tc
be of any weight. Iso government can
exist if the wills of the individuals compo
fmg it do not acquiesce in the public will.
This is the bafi c of all social order and the
security of all rightsâThe constitution
has, indeed, deltroyed titles and diftinfti
ons, but does not prohibit those who once
pofl'efl'ed them from seeking the new
means of influence and honour, which 11
has pointed out. Why do they not ther
return to their country, re-possess theii
property, and ast like good fubjefts and
promoters of the public welfare ?âLet
them reject their visionary projects, at
once hostile to reafonand duty, as well a;
to private and public emolument.âRe
member, it is your king that invites you .to
return ; who promises you peace, fafety
and the protection of that law, of which he
is the supreme adminillrator. He has re
ceived the mort marked proofs of the con
fidence of the nation, to whom he is in:e
parably connected, and therefore engages
your fafety, in their name. Return, then,
immediately ; it is the wish of your king, it
is tile wish of the nationâbut at the fame
time, remember, that this fame king who
now speaks to you like a father, is deter
mined to fee tho e laws obeyed, the exe
cution of which is entrulted to him, âand
that if his remonstrances and persuasions
prove fruitlefs, he will adopt every measure
In liis power to prevent you from blindl;

Paris, Nov. 22.âM. Gower, British

ry disagreeable news from India, brought
by the French frigate Medusa, just arrived
from the Isle of France. By the fame ves
sel M. Dufrefne, governor of Pondicherry
writes thus : " Lord Cornwallis, having
advanced with his aimy to within eight
leagues of Serringapatniim, was attacked
on the 15th of May by Tippoo Saib, and
obliged to retreat towards Bangalore, with
the loss of about 500 of his European troops,
a vast number of Seapoys, many pieces oi
cannon, &c- and it was owing only to the
firmnefs and exertions of the Mahrattas,
that he was not harrafied on his retreat."
There are great fears at present in England
left this expedition should in the event, re
ferable the famous capture of his lordship
in Virginia. In consequence of this idea,
the Eait-India Company's funds have fuf
fered acoufiderable (hock, having fallen to
8 per cent.--No pains have been spared in
London to propagate accounts of adiiferent
nature, in order to support their credit.

Lord Cornwallis were negociating a treaty

Friday Feb. 3.
Continuation of tbt Debute on the CoJ ry Billâ
The IlcuJe in committee of tie whole.
Mr. Gerry. The state of MalTachufett'
a!k; nothing more, than equal justice. We
do not come forward, to request favor:
from the United States : we only wish, thai
the l ime fyitern, which is applied toother
parti of the union, may be applied to us.
i>ut in examining this queltion, we will
that gentlemen would not make diftinc
tionwhich will not admit of a difference.
The proposed allowance has been called
a bounty on occupation, and is said to be
very different from that encouragement,
which is the incidental result of a general
commercial system :âbut in reality it is no
bounty. A bounty is a grant, made with
out any cou;,deration whatever, as as
equivalent ; and I have no idea of a boun
ty, which admits of receiving from the
person, on whom it is conferred, the
amount of what is granted. We have
impqfed a duty on fait, and thereby draw
a certain sum of money from the filhermer
âthe drawback is, in all inltances, the
air.ou it of the money received : this is al'
we alk â  and we alii it for a set of men.
who are as well entitled to the regard ol
government, as any other class of citizens.
It has been supposed that the allowance
made to the fifnermen, will amount to <
gre ter sum, than the drawbacks on the
exportation of the filh ; but I think it ha
betn clearly Ihewn, that this will not be
the cafe : on the contrary, it is presuma
ble, that the drawback on the filh wouli
0:1 the whole exceed the sum, which is propo
fed to be allowed to the fifliermen : some
times it might be more, sometimes less.
_ The calculation is made on general prin
ciples ; and it is impossible to calculate tc
a single cent : the quantity of fait, to be
expended on the filh, cannot be minutelj
ascertained : but this was not heretofore
considered as a fufficient reason, why Con
gress (hould refufe to allow the drawback:
they allowed it, though in a different Ihape.
It is now proposed to make a further com
mutation gentlemen call this a bount)
on occupation 5 but is there any propor
tion made for paying to the fifliermen, 01
to other persons concerned in the filhery
any fuins, which we have not previouflj
received from them ? if this were the cafe,
it would indeed be a bounty: but if we
beforehand receive from them, as much a:
the allowance amounts to, there is no boun
ty granted at all.
If however it really was a bounty on oc
cupation, it would after all be only an in
dulgence similar to what has been grantee
to the landed and agricultural interest
We have laid on hemp a duty of 54 cent:
per hundred weight; and 011 beer, ale, and
porter, five cents per gallon. Now I aik
gentlemen, whether the profefled design oi
these duties was to raise a revenue, or tc
prevent the importation of those articles:
they were laid for no other purpose, that
to prevent foreigners from importing them,
and thereby to encourage our own manu
factures ; âand was not that encourage
ment a bounty to the persons concerned in
producing such articles in this country ?
âIf the duties had not been laid, the im
porter could fell much cheaper, than he
now can ; and the landed interest would
be under a necessity of felling cheaper in
proportion âIf those prohibitory duties
operate as a bounty in favor of railing
hemp, & of brewing beer, ale, and porter, I
all;, whether, if a bouncy were proposed on
every qu n al oftifh it might not, with the
fame propriety be granted ? If we have not
a right to grant a bounty in the one cafe we
have as little right to grant it in the other.
A calculation has been offered to frew that the
proposed allowance will exceed the amount of the
prefeni drawbacks, by io,coo dollars 3 year, but
that calculation ha? been proved to be erroneous:
suppose however that this was the faÂ£i, what Com
parison is there between such a tax on citizen]
of the United States, and the tax borne !>y the ci
tizens of Maftac hofetts, lor the ce fence of the
western Irontier ?âA commercial war is waged a
gainst the American fifheries, by foreign nations
who lay heavy duties on the American fc/h, and
apply the produce of thole duties in bounties t<
their own fifliermen ; and their beinj
left exicn'rve than ours, the duty thus imp ;fed cr
our fifli, dnd bestowed in bouuties to their vessels
operate in a two-foid proportion to the discourage
ment of our fiihermen, and the encouragement u
theirs.
I w;lh to know on what principle gentlemer
can exped, that the citizens of Mafl'achufeit:
liiould contribute 200,000 dollars, or perhaps i
greater sum, for the protection of the western fron
tier againlt the Indians, when no contribution i:
made to support the commerce of Malfachuletts
which, without thU support, will be as etie&uallj
ruined, as if their veflels were captured by an ene
my.âThe principle is carried farther with re.
fpeft to the protection of the frontier : we havi
voted large funis, as presents to the lavages, tt
keep them friendly to the frontier settlers : ther<
is however no clause in the constitution, (that wil
authorise a rneafure of this kind : it is true, in
iced, we have a power to regulate trade and con)
merer with the Indian tribes : but does that giv<
js a power to render the United States tributary
to the lavages ? and if we make them such grant
svery year, do we not in faâ¬t become tributarv t<
hem ?
The gentleman from Virginia [Mr. Giles"
Tays, although this plan of encouraging the fifhc'
ies may be wife policy in Britain, a? being on as
lues surrounded by the sea, yet the United State
vill not equally find their account in purfuin;
he fame plan. The state of Virginia is, in poin
>fexpofure from the sea, very differently circuit)-
lanced from the state of Maflachufetts : wi> havi
1 valt extent of country, 450 miles of fe*-coaft
rxpofed : âThe citizens of ail the alons
he coast are obliged to pursue marine occupa
ions J and I hope ihe gentleman d<- es not wifl
hat the country Ihouid be depopulated, and th<
nhabitants driven off tÂ» lettle the wtftern territo
)'â¢
The state of Virginia is very hip-ilyÂ« e'reum
lanced with refpeft to a marine war :âfhoule
uch an event take place, that state is pretty fc
:ure from depredations : but when we confide
low much the inhabitants of Malf-chufetts ar<
rxpofed in a cafe of that kind, we ought to looJ.
orward, and make some provision for their de.
ence : they have as good a *ight to expect, tha
;overnme*t will make some arrangernents so
their protedlion, as that they ihall be obliged t<
:ontribute for the defence of the western fioniier
But, their commerce, it seems, must not be sup.
>ortea ! taxes however must be laid ; and thof<
axvs applied to encourage the farmer], and t<
>xibe the Indians into peace ! . . . . Isjhis fair
s this pursuing a liberal l'yftem of politics ? wil
his reconcile the minds ofourpeople Â»o gene
al government ? If so reasonable a proportion bi
ejedled by the House, it will convi-nce the citizen
at that state, that it is theobjeft of government t<
ieftroy their commerce, and to make them en
:irely dependant on the agricultural interest-
Here Mr. Gerry rtad a statement, to shew th<
diminution of revenue in consequence of the fail
ure of the filheries : and added,
To support thefifhery, is to support the reve
nue ; by that staple, the citizens of Mafiachufett!
are enabled to pay the revenue that is expe&ec
from them j and, by an attempt to fan 10,00 c
dollars, government will probably facrificc. ?oo,coc
---and, besides, lose the confidence of the citizen:
of that state.
The only question now 15, whether this be a di
re& bounty, or simply a commutation of the al
lowance already granted by Congress ? If the lat
ter be the cafe, 1 can fee no reason, why we fhoulc
refufe our aflent to a proportion, which is onlj
calculated to do justice to the people concerned,
and to give encouragement to a very importani
branch, which stands in need of the support of go.
vernment, more than any other branch in theU.
nited States ; especially as the proposition will e
ven have a tendency to encreafe the revenue.
Mr. Goodhue. Some gentlemen, who arc
athcrwife not averse to the principles of the bill
ask, why this money which is intended to be
allowed to the fitliermen, as a drawback for the
duty on fait, cannot as well be paid to the own
ers of the filTiing vessels, and by them paid to the
fiihermen, without being particularly arpexed tr
the tonnage râlf this mode were adopted, we
would then be obliged to depend on the oath o:
the owner of each veflel, for the quantify of si fli
taken, and of fait used in the vessels ; and this
would open a wide door for fraud. But here we
have the quantity of filh taken in a year, and
the tonnage of the vessels employed j and we have
apportioned the sum to the tonnage, so as not tc
exceed the sums which government now pays or
an average, one year with another. It is true,
ibat if the fifhermen take a smaller quantity ol
fifh, government will have to pay more in the
bounties than they would in the diawback ; but,
r>n the other hand, if a greater quantity of fi/b be
taken, the bounty will be less in propv>rtion. It ij
not easy to deviJe a rule, that will better secure
the revenue, than this wiil : it would be impro
per to appeal to the owner's oath, for the quan
tity of fifh taken by his velTel during the year :
but the regulations in the bill exclude the polfi
bility of fraudâthe veflels being beforehand
mealured, and having their tonnage afrertained
our own officers, and a license being required
besides. We do not come forward under the idea
>f receiving a bountyâthere is no bounty in the
:afe : that is merely a word used to exj-refs the
ame idea that is already admitted.
Mr. Williamfon. It lias been urged with
jreat propriety in favor of the bill now submitted
:o our consideration, that the operations ps our
?.\Y3 should in all cases tend to encourage ufeful
nduftry : that wl.iie ve are givirg l ac!; t:c!u
ies on ail other foreign goods which are export
d, it would be unjuit and cruel ro refufe a lull
flwback of the duties on (alt which may be
exported, especially w hen the circumstances of its
fcxpoitation, are attended *with an immensity of
riches and strength to the nation. Imprefi'ed as
I am with the force ot these argument?, and de
'nous as J an> to protedt and encourage the na
tive leamen or America by all prudfrnr, pra&ica
b e, and conlfitutional means, 1 (hall neverthe
eh rind it my duty to vote for striking out the
firft legion of the bill, because ii proposes to
a bounty for the encouragement of vefTels
employed in the fifheries.
We have been cold that the name is improper j
â  hat it is limply a drawback of the duty upon
'alt, and gentlemen have produced a very ingeni
uis calculation, by which they attempt to prove,
that in Tome years it may happen, thar the whole
â  uty on lilt will not be-repaid ; but they admit
that on some years, the draw back or bounty will
xceed the duty. It is their opinion,
and in this we are peifec\ly that the mo
ney to be paid will be more than that received,
else there had been no ulc for so large an appro
priation. We ihail not trouble the committee
with calculations on this fubjedh It is conceded
hat the encouragement to be given probablv will
xceed the full drawback of the duty on fait. In
other words a douceur or a proper bounty is to be
uivenâlet us call it one thou/and dollars per an
num. Is it within the poweisof this Congress to
grant bounties ? I think nor, and on this single
poll - ion, I would reft the argument.
In the cortfliturion of this government there are
two or three remarkable provisions which seem tfl
be i i point. It is provided that direct taxes
lTiail be apportioned among the several ftar?s ac
cording to their refpe&ive numbers." It is alf,
provided that " all duties, imposts, and excises
fliail be uniform throughout the United States : v
and it is provided that no preference ftiall b<* giver
by any regulation of commerce rev enue to th<
ports of one state over thole of an ther. Th<
clear and obvious intention of the articles men
timed was, that Congress might not have thÂ«
power of imposing unequal ..burthensâthat il
might not be in their power to gratify one pari
of the union by oppretiing another. It appeared
pollibie and not very improbable, that the timt
might come, when by greater cohesion, by more
unanimity, by more addrcfc, the representative:
of one part of the union might attempt to impofc
unequal taxes, or to relieve their coÂ«ftituents at
the expence of the people. To prevent the pofli
bility of such a combination, the article; that J
have mentioned were injerted in the constitution.
Suppose a poll tax should be attempted, Tuppoft
it fliould be enabled that every poll in the ealterr
states ill all pay a tax of half a dollar, and ever)
poll in the southern states should pay a tax of one
dollarâDo you think we should pay the tax Â«
No, certainly. We fh .uld plead the constitution,
and tell you that the law was impotent and void.
But we have been toju chat Congress may give
bounties for ufeful purpoles j that is co fay, they
may give bounties for all imaginable purposes.
becaule rhe fame majority thai votes the bou ntv
will not fail to call the purpose a good one. Efta
b'ifh the dodtrine of bounties and let us Tee what
may follow. Uniform taxes are laid to raiTc
moneyâand that money is distributedâânot uni
formly j the whole of it may be given to people
i'i one end of the Union. Could we fay in such
a cafe that the tax had been uniformâl think
not. There is certainly a majority in this House
w.ha think that the nation would be lironger and
more independent, if all our labor was performed
by free men. This object might be promoted by
a bounty. Let a poll tax be laid according to the
Constitution, of one dollar per poll j in this cafe
sixty cents must be paid for each Have, and the
number of Haves being 68c,i86, their tax would
amount to 334,911 dollars. To encourage the
labor of citizens, let Congress then give an an
nual bounty of one dollar to every freeman who
is a mechanic, or who labors in the field. We
might be told that the bounty was finall, and the
objedl was good, but the measure would be mofl
opprefiive, for it would be a clear tax of rather
more than three hundred thousand dollars on the
southern states.
Perhaps the cafe I have put is too ftrnng. Con
gress can never do a thing that is so palpably un
just, but this, Sir, is the very mark at which the
theory of bounties seems to point. The certain
operation of that measure is the oppreffton of the
southern (iates, by superior number* in the north
ern interest. This was to be feared at the for
mation of this government, and you find many
articles in the Constitution, beside those I have
quoted, which were certainly intended to guard
us against the dangerous bias of interest and the
power of numbers. Wherefore was it provided
that no duty Avail be laid upon exports ? Was it
not to defend the great ftaole of the southern
statesâtobacco, rice, and indigo, from the opera
tion of unequal regulation of commerce, or une
qual indiiett taxes ; as another article had de
fended us from unequal direÂ£l taxes.
I do not hazard much in faying that the present
Constitution had never been adopted, without
those preliminary guards in the Constitution.
Establish the general dottrine of bounties, and all
the provisions I have mentioned become useless.
They vanifli into air, and like the baseless fabric
of a fifion,Jeave not a trace behind. The com
mon defence and general welfare, in the hands
of a good politician, may supersede every part of
>ur Constitution, and leave us in the hands of
time and chance. Manufactures in general are
ufeful to the nation, they promote the public good
and general welfare : how many of them are spring
ing up in the northern states ? Let them be pro
perly iupported by bounties, and you will find ro
occasion for unequal taxes. The tax may be e
qual in the beginning, it will be fufliciently un
equal in the end.
Mr. Wi llratnfon, We are told that a nursery
>f leamen may be of great use to the nation, and
:he bounty proposed is a very Tmall one. TheTe,
Sir, are the reaTons why 1 have marked this as a
langerous bill: the most dangerous innovations are
i>ade uader theTe circumstance*. To begin with a
jreat bounty would be imprudent, and ts give a
mall bounty f.r a douMJefi ptfrpofr, might de
f-rve a worse epithet. Half a million of dollar<l
)er annum would have been too much for a be
ginning, and perhaps a bounty on the ule of"
leighs, though they are convenient for travelling
n winter 5 or a bounty on stone fences thougli
hey are durable, would not at this time be pru
lent. Ihe ohjecV of the bounty and the amoun'
>f it, are equally to be dilregarded in the prefen''
afe : we are simply toconfider whether bounties
nay fafely be given under the present conftituti Â»n 5
or myfelf, 1 would rather bfg n with a bounty 01
ne million per annum, than one thouland j 1
vilh that my constituents may know, whether
hey are to put any confidence in that paper call*
d the Conftirution.
You will fuft'er me to fay, that the. southern
lates have much to fear from the progrels ofthi#
:overnment, unless your (length is governed bv
>rudence : the operation of the funding fylten ,
)as translated at least two millions of dollars, from
he southern states, that is to fay, from Georgia,
he Caiolinas, and Virginia, to the northern
fates. The interest of that sum, when it shall
>e fix per cent will be 120,000 dollars ; but
he quota of thole states, is at least one third oÂ£
he v.hole j whence it fallows, that they mull
>ay forty thousand dollars every year, in the f;:rm
>f interest to the northern States.* This, itfef â¢
s not fuflicient, and other measures are to be a
lopted for draining the southern dates. Bod
ies to promote the genera! welfare, are alreacy
jrought forward j wc ilia 11 not hear of a bounty
or raising rice, or preparing naval stores. If that
vas the question, the general welfare woold not
lave such prominent features. Ur.lef? the fouth
â¢m States are prore<f>ed by the conftituriou, their
'aluable staple and their vifinnary wealth, must
>ccafion their deftruciion. Three fhortvears has
his government exiftea j it is not three years, but
we have already given ferioÂ»>s alarms to- many of
Â»ur fellow citizens ; eftablifii the dodlrineof noun
ies : set aside that part of the conltitution, which
equires equal taxes, and demand similar diftri
)utions ; dÂ«ftroy this barrier, aud it is not a few
ilhermen that will enter, claiming ten or twelve
houfand dollars 5 but ail manner of perfonsâ-aeo
)le of every trade and occupation may enter at the
jreach until they have eaten up the bread of our
:hildren.
Perhaps I have viewed this pr<-Â»jr& In too feil
ius a light, but if ] am particularly solicitous, on
he fubjedt of finance, that we do not even feern
0 depart from the fjririt of the constitution, it is
Â»ecaufe ] wi/h that the union may be
J'he several states are now pietty wi-11 reli;ved from
he;r debts, and our fellow citizens in the foÂ»th
â¢rr. dates, have very little interest in the national
unds : press them a little with unequal taxes,
ind the remedy is plain.
While I would jhun bountie?, as leading to
Jangerous measures, I am rot inattentive to every
argument that has been advanced by the honora
ble member who firft rose in defence of the bill.
1 bat gentleman te'ls ui, that more than a bushel
>f fait is i)fed in curing a quintal of fifh. If this
adt be eflabli/hed, the former a& should be a
nended by giving a greater drawback. He lays,
he drawback as ir is now paid to the merchant,
Joes not operate so as to encourage the seamen
vho have most need of such afiift-ance. This is
ftry probable, and the parties may be relieved by
iividing the drawback in the very manner pro
>oled in the bill. It it is true that the proposed
counties, will not exceed the average of the draw
jack that should be paid on fait, why do they con*
end about names, unless they are solicitous a
>out the precedent. If our obiedt is to encourage
nduftrv, and to increase our commerce, by fend
ng fjfh to a foreign market, we must adhere
o a drawback j for according to the terms of the
>ill, the bounty is to be paid, though every fifh
hat i" caught should be consumed in the country j
n which cafe we fhouid be paying a visionary
Irawback, when nothing was exported ; according
o the terms of the bill, there is no proportion be
wecn the labor and the reward, so far as the bank
iihery is concernedâthe bounty in all cases be
ng the fame.
Having exercised patience in objefKng to
nis new lyftem of bounties, and having hinted on
ome objedions to the general operation of the
>â¢11, so lar as induftrv and enterprize, may be
j ] fhalJ, in a few words, submit the out
ine of a plan that seems to comprehend all the
ifrful parts of the bill, without any speculation
jpon bounties.
If the drawback en dried fifti exported, is not
qual to the duty on the lalt uled in curing such
ifh, let the drawback be encreafed to eleven cent*
>r twelve cents, as the cafe may be. Let us fup
>ofe that the drawback for the next year, will be
qual to the drawback on the lalt year j and Jet
hat fjm of money, being the expected drawback,
>e divided between the leamen and owners accord
ng to the terms of the bill j the accounts must be
nade up annually. If the drawback exceeds the
Jlowance that had been made, the aifference will
âºe considered as advanced to the fifliery, and the
illowance for the next year mult be lomewhat re
luced according to the actual amount of the
Irawback. If the fiftiermen are more fortunate
>r more a&ive, and the exports are increased, the
illowance for the next year must be raised. The
ule being fixed by law, all that remains beir |
>ure calculation, may be done from year to y â¢
>y the executive. Every important objed of this
>il! that has b;en prelented to our view, n.ay be
>btained by fafe and constitutional steps. Why
nould a man take a dangerous and a doubtful
>ath, when a fafe one pretents itfelf ? If nothing
nore is desired than to regulate and protest the
iihery, the bill may be altered and accommodated
0 that purpose : if the theory of bounties is so
3e eftahlifhed, by which the southern states must
ufter while others gain ; the bill informs us what
nz are tu expec*.
