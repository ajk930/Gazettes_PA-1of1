For the Nat(on al Gazette.
THE queflion relating to a conftitu
tional exc.Ofion of the Hiinillers os
religion from civil offices is a very feri
ous one, as it aff-fls a refpe&ablc nnd ve
nerable order cf citizen?, and fti 1 mo: .-
important as it involves certain fundamen
tal principles of government.
The American conflitutions hav: taken
different fides of the question ; eve - 'hef
lafeft date, r.nd -the: - Tore â¢ ..-.'.fe
fidleft and cleared information, are in op
pefuion to each other thereupon. Those
who argue for the difq.ir.lification of the
t Â»Wy, fay That religions duties as
} '1 iufficient employment and are of a
nature not to assort villi the bustle of
political fcer.es, and therefore the ministers
of the altr.r fiiculd not only live by the al
tar, but remain at the altar, zdly. that
if eligible to public offices, their influence
over the people will give them an undue
advantage over other candidates, and.by
degrees throw all power into their hands,
which would be neither prudent nor fare
jd'y- That when they enjoy particular
emoluments or exemptions under the law,
it is but right ar.d just that these fhoukl
be ba ancid by particular legal difquali
fications and disadvantages ; other wife
this class of citizens \yolild not be on a le
vel with llie reft. Noyv the fir 11 argument
cannot be allowed the leall weight in the
question. It may be very proper for tht
confederation both of the pahor and the
flock, but is a matter to be decided by
them alone The second argument falls
under a fiir.i'ar observation. If the peo
ple are pleased to fend the man who in
ftruÂ£ts thSm in their religious duties, tÂ®
manage their other concei ns also, and he
is willing to undertake the service, on
principle can either be disfranchifet'
cf their common right ? on no principle
whatever that would not authorize a like
difqualification of any other profcflion, or
calling in life, till the right of chufing and
being chofcn should be narrowed down
to a rank ariltocracy. The third argu
ment has weight, but instead of being tur
ned against the right of such difqualifica
tions, it lies against the wrong of such ex.
emptions. Those who enjoy peculiar privi
leges under the law, may fairly be subject
ed by the law to peculiar d-.fabili' ies.â
And as it would be an injury to them to
impose the latter without the former;
so to grant them the former without the
latter, would be equally an injury - to all
others. When it is considered that reli
gion is not an objedt erf politi al iegulati
' on, and that the rights of ccnfcience are
from the nature thereof as well as by
most of the Declarations of Rights,except
ed out of the jurifdidtion of the civil ma
giftrate, too much care cannot be taken
to keep government and religion separate &
distinct. Andit feemsnot to have been duly
considered, by the constitutions which im
pose these civil djfqualification';, and which
probably did not mean to-violate their
principle cf religious liberty, that they pave
the way therefor as much by beginning
with the difqualificatfons as if they had
begun on the other fide with particular
favours and exemptions. For there is the
fame interference of the civil power on
account of religion, > n the one cafe aa in
the other; and on which ever fide the
government interferes, its interference on
the other fide follows of course. Justice
pleads for it. Privileges auihorite difa
.bililies, and difabiiities lead to privileges ;
'till at length the ministers of religion arc
established into a political order in lhÂ«
llate, the magistrate is cloathed with com
pleat jurifdidtion over it; and religion is
turned into a mere engine of civil govern
ment. Let the ministers of religion ther
be considered by civil society merely
as members of civil society. Let then
claim no privilege not common to all othei
citizens; and let other citizcns impose nc
burden whatever not common to them
selves. Thisu's the only just and fafe
way in which this question can be de
cided. Phi lad. Aug. 8.

" Yc'lerday a molt extraordinary and
! affair hap;: ik-J in this towr.j
Jiid so tru : y laughable that I cannot help
elating it :
" Our friends, Dr. and Mrs. Thomas
"on, arrived here on Saturday from York,
,nd on Monday they were invited to dine
it Mr R. Walker's (with whom they
lave long been in habits of intimacy,) to
.'.ret his brother and a few other friends.
The Doctor having a blue and buff coat
ind waistcoat, and somewhat more than
iftial preparation having been made for hie
-eception, it was quickly whispered in the
neighbourhood that the celebrated Mr.
L'homas Paine was arrived at Mr. Wal
ter's, which caused a considerable hubbub
in the town, and fme of the friends of
our worthy miniltry colledtcd together, &
informed lome of the placid and virtuous
mob, that the notor ous Tom Paine was at
Wrlker's, in St. Mary's, Church-yard, and
that the d d villain had drove his char
iot, in spite of all refiltance, over the fa
cred and consecrated ashes of the dead, as
he was desirous of trampling under foot
the king and constitution of every well
governed State in Europe.
" This business alarmed the neighbour
boo'.!, and the Doctor's carriage was sur
rounded with these raggamuEns, who
threatened to break the vehicle to pieces.
Mrs. T. was dreadfully alarmed, and the
Dcdtor with much firmnefs, alfured them
he was not the person they apprehended;
nor i ad he the smallest knowledge of Mr.
Paine, /jfter some altercatiorr-f He-mob dif
ncrfed, not without much doubting it was
really Mr. Paine who had deceived them
"'1 he Doctor's coachman, an honelt
V( kfhireman, bcipg ignorant of driving
round the church-yard walls, had inadvei
tently drove across it, the gate having been
accidentally left open."

Advrrtifer of Itxjl Tburflay.J
Fellow-Citizens, The present mo
ment is important, and seems to have in
volved in it, consequences, which, perhaps,
we do not anticipateâYou are to decide
whether you will exercise a free and unbi
afled jndgn.f-nt at the ensuing ele&ion for
I'ederal R prefentatives, or whether :
confederation of Leaders lhall determine
your molt momentous concerns, We art
the creatures of habit and therefore oi
precedent, and we ought seriously and de
liberately to examine a principle which the
force of custom may make difficult to a
mend or abohlh. The queltion before you
is, in my opinion, of the fimplcft kind : it
is, whether you will judge for yourselves,
or allow others to judge Jor you ! A con
gregation of men to frame a ticket, sanc
tioned by you, is in faÂ£t a body ofeledtors,
clothed with your authority. Are you
incapable of judging for yourselves, that
you mud hazard a transfer of your molt
important rights ? Is the eflential rights
of luffrage so laborious to you, that you
wish the Herculean ta/lc transmitted to a
fewâlf you confefs yourselves too igno
rant or too indolent to exercise your minds
on this fubjeÂ£t what a misfortune that yoi
did not apply a constitutional remedy foi
this evil, at the organization of your go
vernment ! Mighty as is the talk, yoi
would have found many who would, cheer
fully, have saved you the trouble.
Would you be willir.g to transfer ths
right of managing your fortunes to othei
har/ds ? Every citizen has a fee simple in
government, and he is less at liberty tc
transfer or bargain for his fee, than
he i 3 at liberty to trifle with his eftatc
or squander it away to the prejudice
of his children ; for industry may make
amends for the want of patrimony,
but nothing short of a civil con
vulfion can reltore departed rights.â
As long as we have laws we-(hall have a
tribunal to resort to against injultice ; but
where is the tribunal that Jhall rellorc
your 101 l privileges ?
Be not deceived by the cry of Antife
deralifm ; it is a hackneyed found calculat
ed to delude and alarm youâMen and not
measures are the object, and to make fo/ne
men members of Congress, who proba
bly, without some deep address would ne
ver be approved by the people, you are
courted by the flattering names of Far
mers, traders, manufacturers, and mecha
nics.âWhy this discrimination ? are thefc
different degrees of citizenlhip I The ti
tle of Citizen applies to every free man,
it is his birthright, and let his avocation in
life be whatever it may,he ought to afftrt hiJ
right, and glory in the character of Citizenâ
Men who are thus fond of difcriminationj
are equally fond of debating the charac
ters, which they wish to use as ladders to
ascend to political eminence.âlf we have
any thing to dread, it is the efforts of such
men o hurry us on to the molt deteltable
of all tyrannies, the tyranny of ariltocra
cy.
The Level is thought too great in this
countryâit is harsh and unpleasant tc
some of our fancied great men to be saluted
by the fame title, that every vulgar erta
ture is conltitutionally enti;led to âWhat,
shall the mechanic, lhall the labourer, have
equal weight in tj>e political scale with
a man who is-worth a thousand or more
pounds a year ! This is the rubâand to
obviate this, you are to delegate the right
and the povrer of judging for yourselves
to those who are more capable and more
deserving !
We want no Ticket Mongers : let every
citizen exercise his own judgment, and we
fliall have a good representation in
trigue, favoritifm, cabal and party will
then be at reft. A free and unbiafled
choice will do more credit to Pennsylvania,
will give her more consequence in the
union, and will throw a greater {hare oi
real abilities and worth into her scale,
than all the contrivances of a conference,

NOTE,
Prefentedby Count deKcller, the Prussian
minilter, to their high mightinefles the
States General, dated April 24, 1792.
The ties of confidence and friendftiip,
projected for some years, as well at Ber
lin as Vienna, have been formally cemen
ted by a dtfwcliye treaty of alliance, â¢
Ed at Berlin, on the 27th of February,
and ratified a short time before the de
cease of the Emperor.
The King of Prussia, desirous not to
retard the commun cation of this treaty to
your high mightinesses, has authorised the
undersigned, his Envoy Extraordinary,
and minifler Plenipotentiary, to deliver to
you a copy of the said treaty, which he
has this day the honour to present to you.
The stipulations it contains having for
their aim the general tranquility of Eu
rope, as well as the repose and happiness
of individuals, his majelty believes tnetn to
be perfectly applicable, without the final
led inconvenience, to the position and in
tcrelts of the United Provinces.
The King of Hungary and Bohemia,
on his part difpoling himfelf, high and
mighty lords, to invite you to concur in
chis alliance and to propose to you defen
five engagements similar to those of the
aforenamed treaty, the frisndfhip and inti
mute relations which already unite the
court of Prussia with the republic, engage
his Pruffiati majesty to advise your high
mightinesses of the overtures his apolto
lic majelty is about to make to you â
The king cannot, at the fame time, for
bear the testimony of the fatisfaÂ£tion he
feels, on observing the republic adopt the
fame principles which have determined his
Majelty's alliance with the house of All
stria. Wifhi'lg that your H;gh Might
inefTes may fee, in the fame point of view,
the utility and advantages which will re
sult from the alliances, the king will felici
tate hirafelr on the power of contributing,
as far as may be depended on his majesty,
to the success of a negotiation, wh.ch
cannot fail to conduce to the good of the
Repub:i., and the fatisfaCtion of all the
powers inte.efted.

This permiflion is to continue so long as

Franlfort, May 25. It is repoited that
the Prulfian army, on iti marchryfris re
ceived orders to halt, on account of n ws
being teceived that 60,000 Ruflians have
entered Poland.
London, May 26. Yesterday presented
an extraordinary and an awfnl lcene upon
the ltock-exchange. The fpeculation.s cf
the minilter, which have loft three millions
and an annuity of 170,000Â£. to the pub
lic, have been fatal also to his followers.
The brokers, jobbers and dealers in
the funds, who had confidence in the
irrational speculations of the minister, and
who thinking it impoflible that a person
yvith his means of forming a found judg.
ment could have foregone the opportunity
of saving so large a futn for the nation,
without solid hopes of a substantial rife,
ifted on this flattering hope, which in
volved them to their utter ruin. No few
er than eight persons of extensive specula
tions have fallen vidtims to their confi
dence, and the sum of which the flock
exchange is plundered by their failure is
near two hundred thousand pounds.
In the beginning of the day a letter
was received from a refpedtable house,
intimating that this misfortune, which
they had brought upon themselves by trust
ing to the falfe hope 3 thus held out, could
not be retrievedâThat they gave up to
their creditors all that they poffelfed, and
that before this letter could reach the ex
change, one of the Partners would is no
more. We forbear, from compassion to
the unhappy relatives, to mention the
name.
We trust that this scene will adt as an
admonition both to ministers and fpecu
idtoisâto the one how they hold forth
uncertain hopes, and to the other how they
believe them, [And yet we fear the leJJ'on will
he ufclefs.J There ij a blind and ttupid
pronenefs to believe in the market, upon
which the minister may work at his wil!
Stunned by this blow, they require only
two days to recover their breath, and they
will stand up again to any bull that may
be let loose upon them.
Breflaw, May 10. The anniversary of
the Polish revolution was celebrated on
the 3d. at Warsaw, not only with all the
unanimity and patriotifin with which (he
new constitution was founded. The joy
was the greater upon this occasion, from
the profpeft of the Cou,t of Vienna and
Berlin having agreed-to reAintain the iu-
dependence of Poland, and the free form
of government they have given themselves.
It is expefrted that the ministerial notifica
tion of these engagements will be shortly
made to the different powers. It is
thought that a messenger, who arrived on
the 18th at Berlin from Vienna, brought
dispatches relative to that resolution as the
next day Prince Reufs, Ambassador from
the king of Hungary, sent a courier to
Rufita ; and the Court sent one to Lon
don, and another to PcterAurg.
PHILADELPHIA.
August zr, 1792.
The great, leading, master error in the
conduct of the National Government (fays
a correspondent) has been the ill-judged ami
unjust idea of making the government flat
tering and lucrative to aparticular interest,
without regard to general considerations of
equal and found policy. It seems to have
been the underftunding of our rulers, that
government could not fafely lean on the
broad support of the people at large, and
that the state governments were foreign
authorities, notfellow-fervants of the fame
people, and consequently that the state go
vernments were to be plucked of their a
gency and influence in all cases possible, and
that a particular sett of men were to be
buoyed up by such means as would bind
them by the flrong link of interest
ed motives to an implicit and affive devo
tednefs to the government.â The favorite
interest made choice of for this mis-judged
narrow project, was a monied interest,
which, as an army of influence in the ser
vice and pay of the government, might beat
down all obstacles arising out of popular 111-
terefts and opinions, and thereby open the
way for the government to whatever objetl
it might drive at. This view of the caie is
a fort of key to the whole hillory and scheme
of the federal leg: fiction. It opens the secret:
of the funding fyttem, which did not move
on the fohd bottom of public faith or en
larged justice ; but was trimmed and mo
dified to suit the particular cafe of the greal
jobbers in certificates. Hence, the scheme
of the bank so modified as to put millions,
fay four, five, or fix, into the pockets of the
paper or monied men, beyond any plea 01
pretext of legal claim or equitable preten
iion. So also, the consolidation of all debts
the government could lay its hands upon
and the making the fame irredeemable ant
perpetual as far as coukx be done : So again
the laying out the people's money, paid oui
of their laborious earnings, so as not tc
lighten their burdens the mort possible, bul
in luch manner as to benefit that particuiai
favorite monied interelt which the govern
ment had eillifted into its support. âIn fur
therance of the fame erroneous and falls
system, every 'meal'ure almost has tendec
to huddle up the great mass of public papei
into as few hands as might be, according ti
the observation of a deep and famous poli
tician, that a large film of money in a few
hands or one hand, gives far more weigh!
and influence than the fame sum difperl'eci
among many, where they could not so eafilj
run parallel 10 one another by reason oftheii
number, and many of them havingother in
terests to check their monied fee.ings, ami
warp them off from the course of the mail
body. If the whole annual revenue of three 01
four millions were to get into three or four,
or even thirty or forty hands, what couh
stand againftfuchan influence ; and the rule
of proportion holds on any other scale oi
luppolition. What the final ultimate objefl
in all the wrong mealures pursued, may
have been, time will, no doubt, belt unravel.
â But one thing has struck the notice ol
d.finterefted obfervcrs, namely, that the
monied interest is universally thought to be,
as a body, (whatever exceptions there may
be) the leal!: republican in their sentiments,
manners and opinions, of any interest among
'.is; and that the men most known to favour
hereditary government, are the men whe
most caress the monied interest as the pillar
and ftatr of power; so that there lias been
a kind of alliance and fellow-feeling be
tween them in mofl public measures, and,
doubtless, for ends approved by both. All
this, however, is totally wrong: for out
government being built up by the people,

The military policy of General Fayette
eems in every refpeft to be copied from the

beginning of the war with Great-Britain.
By skirmishes with the enemy on the fron

lecefiity of discipline, and will give them

rive aÂ£tion with troops, who have been
aught from their infancy to look upon

Emigration from the Netherlands, &c. &c.
At 110 period since the firit discovery of
America, has the spirit of emigration been
so general, as it is at prefentâlnftead of
servants by indenture, sent out from Great-
Britain, Ireland and Germany, we find se
veral respectable families from all these
countries coming daily into our ports, with
an intention ot establishing factories, and
little colonies in our frontier towns and
back settlements,
A veflel that arrived at one of our northern
ports, a few days ago, brought near 500,
and another 750 paflengers, many of whom
were of the class abqve mentioned. These
people have given it as their opinion, than
no less than ten thousand would emigrate
this fall from one port in Ireland, if an op
portunity fhonld offer on board American
reffels, which in general are preferred to
those of tl.eir own country, It is also con
fidently aflerted by late information receiv
ed in different parts of the continent, that
upwards of four thoufaild mechanics, mer
chants, gentlemen, and noblee, from the
Pais bas or Netherlands, and who, with
refpeel to the present contest there, meant
to be altogether neuter, and wifiiingon that
account, though in vain, to fleer clear of
the itorms, chey for some time pall saw
gathering in their political horizon, came
to a refoiution of quitting their native
country foreverâand to seek that peace
and happiness, in a foreign clime, whicl s
hath been denied, both to them and their
ancestors, tor above three hundred yearsâ
the Low Countries, as they are called,
having been always made the theatre of
war upon the continent of Europe. Some

Extract of a Literfrom a Prelbyterian Minister
in England, to his friend in Philadelphia, dated
May 8, 1792.
I have often and long talked of going so
America. 1 have been thinking much of it
of late, there being many things on this fide
of the water to alienate my affections from
my native country. Had I no family I (hould
not think of moving ; but lam thoroughly
persuaded America is a country greatly pre
ferable for a numerous family like mine.
The load of our public taxes is enormous,
and provilions of all ii.rtsfo very dear, that '
young people find it very difficult to fetth:
in life and support a family,âwhich is one
of the greatelt evils that can happen a soci
ety.
Many of us are on the tip-toe to go,â.
particularly people in the farming line. It
is almolt inipoihble to obtain a farm that isworth having. lam confident if some per
sons of reputation were to go over and ob
tain a comfortable settlement, numbers
would soon follow. If a farm is likely to be
vacant here, numbers are eagerly catching
at it. Indeed we are very much in one
another's way: There are more people of
every trade, in almost every town in the
kingdom, than can get business to lupport
them. _ â¢
The Birmingham riots have raised such a
spirit ofbigotry againil: Difienters, that we
can hardly be said to be fafe. Our repre
sentation in parliament is so very partial,
the system of government so corrupt, the
reigning family so extravagant, public an<l
parochial taxes such a grievous burden,
that I expeÂ£t, in the course of a few years,
especially if trade Ihould fail, or we (hould
have another war, considering how high
party spirit runs, we shall be altogether by
the ears.
Your early marriages in America, shew
that a livelihood is not difficult to be ob
tained. Here, thinking young men are of
, ten afraid to marry,âand very well they
may : The expence ofhoufekeeping is be
come enormous, and thoulands of the la
bouring poor canuot get food and raitnesit,
though ever ever so sober and frugal.
' Your countryman Thomas Pa'ne, and a
Mr. Barlow, are printing political pam
phlets, which are well adapted to diffufe a
knowledge of the rights of man, and indi
viduals are enlightened by them ; but the
nation in general ara so fond t>f their estab
lished church, and their old government,
that no alteration is likely to take place at
present, aod whenever it does, it will proba
bly be as it was in America, by a civil war."

Notwithstanding the supposed neutrality
of the Prince of HcfTe Caflel, he has joined
the confederacy against France, and ha?
marched his army towards the Rhine.â
The finall army of French emigrants was
still at Coblence the latter end of May, to
gether with the Noblesse, who had recently
aflembled in that city to appoint Monjieui
regent of France, in the place of Louis the
lixteenth, ifiue amanifeffo, and then begin
the attack upon France, to be supported by
the combined armies.âEvery late account
front Europe represents the French emi
grants as in the highest spirits, and making
110 doubt but they would return to their
hemes and pofleflions the ensuing autumn. â
Sever?! hints are given that a defenfive
warfare would be adopted by the National
Aflembly : this, however, does not seem
rfko comport with their declaration of war,
V which would imply offenfive operations :
the emigrants do not, it is said, scruple to
aflert openly that the declaration of war
â¢was carried by their secret friends in the
aflembly.âThe American funds had fluctu
ated in a very uncommon degree in Lon
don, within the last 6 months.' Those who
speculated in them in the firft instance had
made immenfe> sums, and so high was the
public opinion in their favour, that the 6
per cents were run up to 150 ; this ficti
tious value, however, did not last long, and
the sudden fall is said to have been one
cause of the failures in New-York : On
the 7th of June they were down at twelve
fhilliags, producing an interest of five per
tent,âLetters from Valenciennes to per
oris in Paris had confirmed the news of
General Rochambeau's resignation : that
Marshal Luckner's plan of otfenfive war
had been renounced by the other Generals,
and that of Rothambeau (the defenlive)
adopted. âOther accounts fay that " Ge
nerals Rochambeau, Luckner, and Fayette
were to determine on the 19th of May, the
plan of the campaign, and whether the
war for the present season should be ovFen
five or defenlive. As their decision was
to be kept a profound secret, it is not likely
that the real plan could yet have been
known when the last accounts left France.
âAlthough the court of Spain does not en
tirely abandon the French eniigrants, hav
ing granted peniions and a maintenance to
several of them, yet it does not appear that
that court is at all friendly to their hopes
of a counter-revolution; "We shall not
(fay the Spaniards) be drawn to enter into
the league formed against France, even in
a pecuniary sense." âThe Heflian troops
which form a cordon towards the Rhine,
are fifteen thousand in number ; they are
upon a war establishment. It is scarce
ly any longer doubted, but that this army
will join the Prufiian and Austrian for
ces. The Landgrave of HelTe hopes, no
doubt, by this mark of compliance to
fil l the ninth electorate now vacant.Â»
Tranquility being perfectly restored atPa

rank of nobility.âA letter from Paris to a
correspondent in London, dated May 21,
fays, "it is all over, with the national As

officers and gentlemen, with the Pruflians
Auftrians, and Sardinians, who will, on the

that he approves of the new constitution,
which humbled the clergy and discarded!
the monks ; and a strong prefumpLion that
he withes to do the fame in Spain.âThe
people of the Netherlands are no doubt
ripe for a revolt from the Austrian domi

adopted by France, they will not dare to

great solemnity committed to the flames,

" The Indians from time to time steal
ourhorfesâl am clearly of opinion that
since the firft settlement they have stolen
horses to the amount of upwards of 30001.
that is from Columbia alone and its vici
nity.
" They now and then kill some of our
citizens and scalp them, or carry them into
a horrid captivity. The latter end of April
they killed within three miles of Columbia
a Mr. James Nevil, a lieut. in our militiaâ
a young man of great worth ; they nearly
lkinned his head all over in taking off his
scalp. The loss of this valuable member of
society was greatly regretted, and was a
very severe blow to his alHiited mother,
who had but a few months before followed
her hulband to the grave ; and was left
with several small children, leaning and
depending in a great measure on this her
dear son. He was brought in and buried
with great decency. The Rev. John Smith
preached a funeral sermon 011 the occasion.
A Mr. Ball was killed or taken prisoner at
the fame time ; he has not lince been heard
of. A Mr. Qrcut who was in company
received two wounds, but got in and is
nearly recovered. About the firft of May
some men were killed at Dunlap's stationâ
and within a few weeks two men were
killed on the road between Cincinnati
and Lexington. Three anibafiadors are
sent to the different Indian nationf,to nego
ciate a peace,âa Mr. Gerard, an inhabitant
of Columbia to the Shawanefe âMajor Tru
man to the Delawaresâand Col. Hardin to
the Wiandots (as I am informed.) We
have as yet no news from them, and grow
uneasy 011 their account.
" The Indians who are prisoners at Fort-
Waihington, behave as I am told with great
fortitude and propriety ; and are industri
ous in their way, when they can get any
thing to do, and seem anxious to â¢procure
wampum- The Indian Queen is wellâa
week or two ago Major Trueman afkedher
acceptance of a guinea, which she feenied
not to know the value of; but being in
formed it would procure her so much wam
pum, she accepted it with becoming grati
tude ; lince which, their greatest artists
have busily been employed in making
a belt of the moll brilliant kind ; after they
had finifiled this, they took a Dotfor
Brown who is in the medical department,
a man of great humanity and goodn'efs of
lieart, who on all occasions had sympathized
with them in their captivity ; and with all
the ceremonies of Royalty crowned him
King of their nation : after the coronation
the Queen approached and paid him all that
homage due to his Majesty, her rightful So
vereign ; after which all the reit in due
order approached and paid their obeisance.
They had procured for him all the kingly
robes in their power, and drelfed him in
the grand belt of wampum they had made."
A Virginia paper; among other western
intelligence, has the following paragraph.
"Capt. Butler (brother to the unfortunate
General of that name) has returned to
Cumberland from Detroit ; he was allu
red by the Britiih commander at the post,
that the report lately circulating of the ge
neral being still living and api ifoner with
the Indians, was not only without founda
tion, but related to him the following me
lancholy particulars of his death :âSoon
after the retreat of our army, on the 4th
of November last, from the bloody plains
of Miami, the well noted and as infamous
Simon Girthie, came up to the general, who
was then fitting : he knew him and spoke
co him ; the general Suffering under the
molt excruciating pain from his wounds,
delired Girthie to put an end to his misery ;
but he declining to give the fatal stroke,
turned and whispered to an Indian (landing
by, that the person he had jtift been speak
ing to, was the commander of the defeat
ed army ; upon which the Indian immedi
ately funk his toma-hawk into his head, and
he expired. A number of Indians then
Surrounded and scalped him ; but what is
moll lhocking to relate, they opened his
body, took out his heart, cut it in as many
pieces as there were tribes in the action, and
divided it among them. âthus died the
Brave General BUTLER."
The fame paper further informs " that
1500 Indians were lately in council at the
Maumee towns âthat they were determin

At a meeting of the inhabitants in Dut
chefs county, New-York, on the4thinll.
the following Resolves, among several
others, were unanimously pafied :
" Resolved, That in the opinion of this
meeting, George Clinton, ESq. is, by the
conllitution and lawsof this state, Gover
nor thereof; and that Pierre Van Cort
laudt, Esq. is by the fame authority Lieute
nant-Governor of the fame ; and that it is
the indilpenlible duty of every citizen
peaceably to acquieSce in their administra
tion, during the time for which they have
been eleited.
" Resolved, Thattocalla convention at
this time, under the pretente of altering
what may be thought defective in the con
flitution, or ofredrefling supposed grievan
ces, will, in the opinion of this meeting, in
the prefentftate of men's minds, be danger
ous to the happiness and welfare of all or
ders of men in the state, and we greatly
iear, ruinous to the republican principles of
the government.
And whereas, AlTociations are forming
in various parts of this state, whole avow
ed objefl is no way attainable, but by a re
volution in the government. Therefore,
" Resolved, That in the opinion of this
meeting, it is the great duty of every citi
zen, and more especially the magistrates
who are more particularly interested with
the public peace, to discountenance such
dangerous associations."
It was also resolved, " That a meet
ing be called 011 the 27th of Augult, to
take into consideration, the present state of
pubi c affairs, and that it b;; recommended
to the inhabitants of the several towns, as
it may be inconvenient for tneni so afferftl
generally, to appoint a committee far this
purpose."
" A number of those (fays a New- Yorfe
paper) who before were called strong Ftilc
rahjls, are now the supporters of Governor
Clinton. They have long beheld, with ad
miration, the chara&er and conduit of &
man whose patriotism and justice has been
so conspicuous in all his actions. The fn
perfeding him,as has been attempted,- woulit
have been a great injury to the United

great luminary of the law. A certain par
ty, however, did not mean that Mr. J ââ

had he fucceeded âA young man, who has

LONDON, May 25.
Society for Constitutional Informa
tion .
May 18, 1792.
At a meeting held this day, the following letter
was received, addrefled to the Chairman of this
Society :
" SIR, London, May io, 1792:
" The honourable patronage which the society
for constitutional information has repeatedly giv
en to the works entitled Rights of Man, renders
it incumbent on me, to communicate to them
whatever relates to the progress of those works.
" A nnmber of letters from various
parts of the country have come to me, exprefling
an earn eft desire, that'the firft and lecond pare of
The Rights of Man could be rendered more gen
erally ufeful, oy printing them in a cheaper man
rer than they have hitherto been; as those requests
were f: m persons to whom the purchase at the
prefrnt price was inconvenient, I took thÂ« pro
per mean* for complying with l heÂ»r tequeft.
I am since informed,, that the ministry in
tends bringing a prosecution ; and as a nation
" (as well the poor as the rich) has a right to know
11.it any -vorkvare, tkat are made the fubjeft of
a prosecution ; the getting out a cheap Jtdkion is,
3 conceive, rendered more neceflary than 'before,
as a mein3 towards supporting that right ; and 1
have the pleasure of informing, the society, that I
am proceeding with the work.
I am, Sir,
with great refpeft,
(t Your obedient humble servant,
" THOMAS PAINE."
The society took into conficeration the con
tents of the aforefaid letter, and came to the fol
lowing resolutions :
Rcfolved, That the thanks of this society be
given to Mr. Thomas Paine, for the communi
cation he has made, and for the patriotic disin
terestedness manifefted therein.
Refolvcd, That this society will contribute its
utmost aid towards supporting the rights of the
nation, and the freedom of the press, and him
who has so efientially and fucctfsfully contribut
ed to both.
Resolved, That the right of investigating prin
ciples and l>ftems of government is one of those
rights j and that the works of any which
c; nnot be refuted by rea(->n, cannot, on the prin
ciples oi" god.government, or of common sense,
be made the subject of prosecution.
Resolved, That the excefiive taxes which this
country pays, being now fevents;en mil/ions an-,
nuallv, an additional motive tor the exerciie
of this right ; and render it at the fame time a
more immediate duty the nation owes to itfelf, to
enter unon and piomote all such investigations.
Resolved, That a committee be appointed to
enquire into the rumour of the above-mentioned
profecuticvn ; and to report thereon to the society
at its next meeting.
Resolved, That a copy of Mr. Paine's letter,
together with these resolutions, be tranlmitted to
all the affocifetcd societies in town and country,
and that this society do congratulate them on the
firm as well as orderly ipTrit and tranquil perfevei
ance manifefted in ali their proceedings $ and ex
hort them to a steady continuance therein.
The following fentimentj appear in, the Addrefi of
the above Socitty to the jacobins [or friend i of
the Conftituti-on at Paris j
44 YOURS is not among the least of the revo
lutions which time is unfolding to an aftoniflied
world, that two nations, nursed by lome wretch
ed craft in reciprocal hatred, Ihould so luddenly
break their common odious chain, and ruih into
amity. The principle that can produce i'uch an
eft'elt, is the ofispring of no earthly court j aud
whilst it exhibits to us the expensive iniquity of
former politics, it enables us, with bold felicity,
to fayâWe have done with them.
" In contemplating the political condition of
nations, wc cannot conceive a more diabolical fy.f
tem of government, than that which has hitherto
been generally pra&ifed over the world . To feed
che avarice, and gratify the wickedness of ambi
tion, the fraternity of the human race has been
deftroyea ; as if the several nations had been cre
ated oy rival gods. Man has not considered man
as the work of one creator.
" The political invitations under which he
lias lived, have been counter to whatever religion
tie profeticd. Initead of that universal benevo
lence which the morality of every known religi
on declares, he has been politically bred to con
sider his species as his natural enemy, and to de
scribe virtues and vices by a geographical chart.
" These principles we now declare are not pecu
liar to the society that addrefies you. I hey are
xcending themselves, with accumulating force,
Ihiough every, part of our country., and derive
strength from an union et causes which no other
principles admij.
44 'i he religious friend of man, of every deno
mination, records them as his own $ tney ani
mate the lover of liberty ; and they cheriih the
aeart of the poor, now bending under an oppiel
fioh of taxes, by a profpeft or relief.
. 44 We have against us only that fame enemy
which is the enemy ofjuftice in all countries, a
herd of courtiers fattening on the spoil of the
public.
44 Ic would have given an additional triumph
to our congratulations, if the equal rights of man
(which are the foundation of your declaration of
rights) had been recognized by the governments
around you and tranquility eftabliflied in all :
But if despotism be itill reserved to exhibit, by
ionfp:racy and combination, a fartner example of
infamy to future ages ; the power that disposes of
events, best knows the means of making that ex
ample finally beneficial, to his creatures."
