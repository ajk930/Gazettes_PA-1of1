Mr. Freneau,
j T would be to the advantage of the Unr
ted States it" there was not a newspaper
in it, for t!i:v are the vehicles of sedition,
wilt ;:rt til-.' llie illi of exciting jealoulyin
the minds of the people and diltniit of the
infallibility of their rulers. They have
tee.ne.l lately with criticisms on the pro
clamation of the Preiidetlt, which was evi
dently deli/.ned for goÂ«d purposes, to warn
t!ic ;)'<)j;! people ot America th ic the lt.ite
of' France \v.Â«H critical, that they fliouM
have nothing to do with her, that treaties
â¢were those Â»f inttreft an 1 not or faith, anil
that if the citizens interfered they mould
be put to the bar of the government. Nu
difpalÃonate mail could take ex.eep.ion at
this intention. Although the proclamati
on was irtued immediately after the c.eua
jration of war by France againit Gre.it
Britain, it is evident that there was a go
vernmcntal I like wrmnefs before,aid inat
lje imprudence of France in not l ubniittin ll
tj t!)e ditlator/llip of Great Britain, ha
produced a ftiil greater coldness Surely
every one niuit allow that the connection
between America and France is a very un
natural one, considered in every point of
view, and that therefore the executive was
highly to by commended tor taking the
eirliell opportunity to make ic appear.
The French have a diltinA 'language, the
execu rive in general do not speak : rench,a
coa.ieftion therefore between them and
Frenchmen mult be unnatural. Our man
ners, cuitoins, habits, have aÃrltifii etymo
logy, and as there is no nation in thf
world, nay I would fay in the creation
tha: can possibly compare with them in an)
t'ling that is great and wonderful, no won
der that we Ihould give them a preference;
I: is a compliment paid to ou f.-lves.â
There 13 a considerable analogy between
the governments and leading ine:) of the
two countries, as well as of their iyllems.
ihefe would naturally incline n that way
as birds of a feather flock tnget/ierâthere i:
a congeniality of sentiment between Aims
influential â men here and there, a politica
affection, and as they have the fame object:
in view, a connection is quire natural â
With France the thing is otherwiseâthe
dregs of society, the people, wifli to posses:
the fovereignty âTuis is unnatural anc
therefore cannot beget the afFection of on.
government âIn France diltinetions arc
abolilhed ; even the niolf trifling pageantr)
of monarchy or ariltocracy i 3 abolished
and therefore it does not harmonize with
the men of our gover .menrâl n France
merit begets confidence and trull, her<
money is the high road to confluence ant
power, how unnatural therefore mult b<
such a connection âIn short, altho' the pea
pie may correspond in their principles ant
their willies, there u such a dilcordanct
in the governments, that a connection can
not pofiibly fubiiftâlt might be fuppofec
that the late war between America ani
Great Britain, had alienated every favour
able impredion ; but this has only obtainet
among the vulvar, who are more difpofe<
to resent injuries, and keep alive enmity
than men of better condition âThe wif
men of this country, by which is under
flood, the men in office, are not under thf
influence of such narrow considerations,
they love Great Britain, becaufc she fa
vours their views, they detelt France be
cause (lie iÂ« hostile to themâHow judici
ous, how wife was the proclamation 1
It is a blefled circumltance for the Uni
ted States, to keep at peace with Great
Britain, for without it, we fuould have no
.loathes to wear ânakedness and barbar
ism would be seen (talking thro'the landâ
JJ"he manufaÂ£tnres and literature of France
V are a bagatelle in the scale with Great Bri
tain'sâAn Englilhman can tight three
Frenchmen, and by the fame rule he can
make better cloth, and better ideasâHow
politic is our government to cringe to the
Britiih lion, as well as to the BririQi Mi
uerva !
Itisanabfurd and vulgar idea which
many people entertain in this country, that
treaties ought to be held lacredâthf y are
things of convenience, and as soon as they
answer the purpose. they arc to be laid
aside, as a man would lay afitlj his breeches
when he had no further life for themâthe
treaty with France, was a thing of necefii
ly with us, and as it was the effect of force,
it ought not to be binding âThe proclama
tion has wifely declared this.
An error has crept into our confiitution
that treaties fliould have the force of law,
but this constitutional prortfion is very pro
prrly superseded hy proclamation ; for ac
cording to ir, have two men been arretted
for acting according to treaty, and agaiiilt
proclamationâThe Cayenne republicans
censure this actui arbitrary, and fay that
the proclamation was au infringement ol
law, and not the conduct of the volunteers,
for independent of the treaty they were
freemen, aud not {laves obliged to obey
the mandates ol" a Jovereign âBut this it
all fluff; lor their aiTeit i?j approved of by

the spirit ol the proclamation declares u
to be fubjeits, and no fubjett seas a right ti

How just then is the prosecution, ho w jult,
how leg a 1 the proclamation ! Upon the
whole, sir, in whatever light I place the
conduct of governmental men, and in what

To the Author of the letters to the Presi
dent of the Uuitcd States, under the sig
nature of VEIU T A 5.
S I R,
VT7HF.N a citizen undertakes to remark
on the public conduct of government
nr it's officers, every poflible attention
Ihould be given to the as v eil to
juard againrt the encroaciiments of their
.lower, and difcoverthe errors they may
have committed, as to prevent improper
ideas being entertained igainft them ; for
3s much evil may arise from rendering a
jood adminiflration unpopular and odious,
us is to be feared by an enlightened and vi
llain people from a bad one. The lor
:ner, overturned, makes a change of fylteni
and coiiduct neceflary, which mult be for
:'ie worse, while a discovery of the latter
rnuft always tend to better it by amending
what was faulty.
I am led to this reflection by your twe
letters under the lignature of Veritas ir.
the National Gazette, ol the iff and jthoi
]une. addrelled to the President of the
United States, oil the fnbject of his pro
clamation concerning the neutrality of the
Union in the war now raging in Europe.
You have in a file and manner of some
what more tlia:i individual importance,
undertaken to censure the Preiident for
:iie opinions contained in the proclamation,
<ml have boldly pronounced, " that the
ritiiens of these Hates from one extremity
if the Union to the other, are firmly at
tached to the cause of France," and the
inly apparent tendency of both your let
:Â»rs is to intimidate the executive intc
"nmc ait that lhall infringe the neutrality
>f our nation, and involve us in a war 011
thelkleof France againfl all Europe.â
One of the advantages laid down by moll
writers in favour of a republican farm ol
government is, that it is flower to wrath
ind to war than a monarchy : that the
jood sense of the community at large will
:ertainly "set down aud count the coll"
Defore it engages in hostility : that iÂ«,it will
"ee whetht r the objett ii worthy of the ter
ible conferences which always ensue
when the bonds of friendlhip between nati
ons are broken asunder, and the citizen:
educed, as to each ether, to a Urate ofna
mre ; wherein thegreateft muiderer,plnn
tlerer & delli oyer of lifr& property is some
times fallely honored with the greatefl
You, however, would fain have us
chink you are a republican,not withllanding
the evident tendency of ynur letters is foi
war, and you are not contented with gi
"ing your own opinion 03 the subject but
fay it is the decided opinion of the Union.
1 suppose you to be a private citizen, ami
as such, you have undoubtedly a right tc
give your private opinion, and so have I.
and every other individur.l citizen; but it
becomes us. when we do it, to do it with
some little degree of rnodelty. and especi
ally when the proper officer of the govern
ment, entrulled by the conffittition to
speak the sense of the Union in the execu
tive department, had spoken that opinion
in the way that the constitution of this,
and the laws of all nations warrant, by a
proclamation conceived in terms of repub
lican decency, and when this opinion had
iscen approved in addrelles to the President
lay a number of the merchant's and traders
in tlic.- city of Philadelphia, the tow not
Baltimore, and other places where a sense
of a fm;ill p.irt at lealt of the community
one would think might be collected and
known.
Now, Sir, I have no need to call infoVid
any of the eminent qualities wlifch have
been universally allowed to the Prcftdent
whom you so fiercely dttiaunce and call on
to account to you for his proceedings ; be
came, admitting him tots no more than
you allow him to be, your fellow citizen,
and equal in character to yourfelf, his opi
nion is as much entitled to our candid re
ception and examination as your's : and a
little morefo ; because he has put his name
to it, and you have thought proper to con
ceal your's under a signature which I ;a
ther fnfpeil will be an eternal dilguife to
your real name.* There is another consi
deration, that, with modest men, would
certainly give the preference over your's,
to the PreiidenVs opinion, and that is, th;<t
jy the constitution of our government
: which I fear you will nor allow much cre
:lit to, from the tenor of your writings)
certain persons are declared to be his advi
:'jrs ; that is, he has a right to call npon
them for their opinions 0:1 any fubjeel
wherein he Hands in need of advice, and ol
ihefe, at least one, is acknowledged byyoui
warmelt pat tizans to be a true republican ;
md if I millakc rot, he 01'ficially attells the
proclamation. But, Sir, as I don't uiilito
.countenance " our executive department
n aping any abfilrd or tyrannical tyftcms"
[ have meant from the iirft to come to ar
gument with you. to difcardall declamati
on, and examine coolly the merits or de
merits of the proclamation.
Your objeÂ£tions to the proclamation are
imply that the President has laid, it is the
" duty and interest" of the citizensof these
[lates to preierve ftritt neutrality,and-'im
parrial friendlhip to the belligerent pow
;rs"âThefe are the expreliions on which
foil found your alarm, and \\ilh to rouse
the spirit of 1776 ! In we had enemies
to contend with, who having been accus
tomed ito govern us under what was
by them claimed to be a conflitutional au
thority, aimed to destroy our liberty and
property at one stroke, by making laws
binding on us in all cases whatsoever.â
"fhis extravagant claim was attempted to
'V enforced by myriads of hireling troops
rent i:i.'o our aountry to reduce us to fub
ection to iheir will. We refilled force by
force ; our mct;o war, pax queritur bello:
kve conquered âweob.-IJied pcace ; that
peace was solemnly ratified by triples a
jreed on between plenipotentiary mini
ters on both fidesâThe horrors of v. ar
:ealed, and we became friends to Britain
jpon terms advantageous perhaps to both
ides, at any rate they were to us.
I don't mean now to enter into the me
-its of thetreaty. it is fufficient for my pre
ent purpose, that a treaty of peace \\ as e
tabhlhed, ratified and confirmed, befweer
jsaud Great Britain, that similar treaties
ere, Come before and some after, ratifiec
jetwejn and the states of Holland, the
cing of Prussia, and some other powers in
Europe, molt of whom are now ::t war
.vith FranceâNow, Sir, you feein to be
ivhoily ignorant of the force of the term
luty, as mentioned in the Pi efident's pro
:lamatioii. There are, Sir, duties fiibJlit
ngeven between enemies at open war.â
Under the republics of Greece, captives
:;iken in war were either made (lavesfor
ife, or more humanely facriiiced to the
manes of the deceased friends of the c;:p
:ors. Under the Roman republic a milder
fyllem of national jurifpruder.ee obtained,
and their captives were only fubjecled to
1 political fpecic3 of slavery, from which
merit and talents often relieved them ; and
we find that some of the greatett men who
adorn their history, were their lihertini,
or freed men. The introduction of chris
tianity into Europe foftencd, in some de
cree, the lot of captives in war, and'many
us the severities attending it; lience, by
the common consent of modern Europe
an nations, hasrefultecl a fyltem called the
Jus belli et pneis by some, the lew of nature
nations by others ; Grotius, Puiferidorff,
Vattell and some others, have written very
learned works on these fubjefts, and tho'
they have never carricd their ideas as far as
modern treaties between some of the belli
gerent powers anil the United States have
done, yet they all acknowledge certain
things to be due from a nation at peace to
every nation at peace with it. These things
Â¥; Veritas, the Latin word for truth.
[Total. Numb. 170.]
are properly called duties, and whatever
comes within this description was certainly
the duty of the United States, not to Frcnce
only, but to all mankind, with whom we
were not at war: Hence the Prdider.t in
.lis proclamation very jufily made use ot"
tne exprefiion duty. j don't wilh.toavoid,
or even parry, any thing you may have to
lay on this subject, by a change of exprtf

to aflert, as any other person has to deny)
chat it is the duty ot the United States to
avoid every ast which will offend any other
power in the world ; unless* tl.ey are
bound to do such afJ, by some solemn and

r T~ I HE French revolution, next to the
A American, is the molt intereiling ant
awful crisis in human affairs, that evei
claimed the attentionof the world. I fay.
next to the American, becalife the Frenct
revolution may be conlidered in a greal
tneafure as 1 consequence of the American.
Many cause; doubtless coufpired to prepare
the way in France for the great even!
there, and many circumstances, indepen
dent of America, may have coufpired with
her example to propel the French nation
towards the attainment of liberty. But il
is. highly probable, that if America had
basely given back from the glorious contcll
to which Hie was called, or had failed in
elhiblifhing her independence, that France
at this hour would have been groaning
under her yoke, and mankind deprived ol
that general prospect of a better order of
things, which the French revolution holds
out to all Europe. In this point of view it
is natural for every American to feci a pe
culiar interell in the affairs of France, liuce
befidis tiie common motive of philanthropy
and a love of liberty, he mull coniider the
itriiggles of France as a continuation of the
glorious struggles of his own country, for
tiie emancipation of human nature from
llavifh governments and llavifli prejudices,
and for the enjoyment of the equal rights
of man, anil all the blefliugs of civil society,
under the virtuous auspices of a republican
fy.lem. Accordingly, it is mod clear and
certain, that a hearty good will to the
French cause prevails through the great
rnafs of the people, notwithflauding the
artful niifreprefentations which have been
employed to hood-wink and millead them.
They know tiiat theFrenchare fighting for
their rights and liberties, as the Americans
fought for theirs j and that the kings and
nobles of the eartli who have for ages
pall rioted 011 the sweat and blood of the
people, and trampled on all laws divine and
human, are leagued together in defence of
tyranny and iniquity.
i |Â»e Â» c â¢! .* " rthr.ei ts of Am- t <â  a
were mod unequivocally evinced, w lien
they celebrated last winter the ftitcffles of
che arms of the French Repu>,;.ic. The
loth ofAugud putin ("ufpenfipii on royalty ;
and foo'n after the king, for betr;.)irg l'is
trtift, was formally dipi ived of his crown,
$nd the natiun'tlechned robe a Republic.
( his change in thefceneof things, as could
not but happen, was attended with vio
lence, toiivuliiorr, and blood. The agonies
of expiring monarchy, anil the panglul
birth of freedom, difpl. yed a fptffacle lhas
could ealily be disfigured into a pi mire of
horror, and a fad example of popular go
vernments. Advantage was taken of this,
every where, by the enemies of,liberty, to
blacken the revolution, and the fame ait'
were pra&ifed for the purpose here ; so
that for a time the people, embarrafitd
thereby, was beginning to doubt the
propriety of their zeal for the French
cause". At length, Truth forced its way
through the cloud that had been thrown
over it. Fails and circumltances c; me to
be understood. The people found that the
French nation, provoked by royal tifurpa
tion and perfidy, had only, like America,
declared theinfelvcs independent ot all
kingly government, a:.d had set up a Re
public in its (lead ; and tl e confequeiitci
that fell on the enemies of France nu i e ii
evident that the change was a nectii'.'i)
a:td wife, as tvell as a jurtifiable meafuie.
In this (late of things the half-fir,othsrcd
feelings of America broke cut into ;:n ar
dent and general jubilee in honor of the
French Republic. If the public of i
liion and disposition was evtr irrefragably
nianifefUd on any occalion, I think was
on that. For the I:gns and indications of ii
were perfectly free ami | ontaneons. Ihe
example began at Boflon. U the ttf:;irtoi:e;
of heart-felt congratulation with the glori
ous champions of republican liberty in Eu
rope, became in a moment iiniverfaj
throughout our continent. It reminder
me of the effect produced by the pamphlet
"Common Senle," in favour of indepen
dence. The suddenness and universality
of the effect evinced that the fentimenl,
which was the true cause, was before ir.
tile hearts of the people, and was only
brought into aÂ£llon by a well-timed ;.d
---drefstoit. The celebration of the Rrjttih
lican viiiories of France, in or.e view was
the flronger cafe of the two. For, as 1
remember, the people of their ow 11 accoicl,
rullied into f'eilive expreiHons of their joy
at didant places, so near the fame moment
of time, that at many it could not be produ
ced by the example set at others, but mull
have been the uninfluenced,benevolent efi'u
iionof hearts gladdened with the preps ef:
and triumphs of that liberty of which they
taded the sweets themfclves.
The conduit of the American people on
the occalion alluded at, is the more de
serving our recolleflion now, bccaufe it
was poderior to anjtl founded 011 a know
ledge of the and ;<' ' 1 ijon
met.t of the king, and the erefiicn of t/.i
Republic on the ruins of monarchy. Tin:
conlideration proves clearly the attachment
of the Americans to republican government,
antl that they approved of the proceed::.--
! agaiuft the king, 011 the bel tf of bib en-
I rninal attempt to betray the cor.iututioi,
he had sworn to ftipport, and the countrx
that gave him bit ll\ into the cruel har.ds cl
foreign I'-fp- ts . Now, it the people of A
merica viewed ti.e niatter in this light,
how can it be, as feme would afi'eÂ£t, that
their attachment to Louis riiould alienate
them from the nation for putting him tc
death, a: d out of pity to one poor mortal,
make them indifferent or unfriendly to a
cause involving the late of millions, and
perhaps the fate of liberty in one half the
globe, and possibly, in the event, oil the
other half too. Noâlt is impossible. If
the king deserved to lose his crown in the
eyes of Americans, and they deemed the
eltablidiment of complete liberty agreeable
to American principles, on a republican
plan, so glorious to the people and nation
of France, the circumdance of punilhing
the royal offender with death, can never
turn their eyes or their hearts from the
grand objett Liberty, the liberty of
France, the liberty of Europe, the liberty
of human nature. They may recollect
with fenlibility the light in which they foi
inerly viewed the unfortunate Louis; they
may and ought to pity his lamentable faie ;
they may perhaps Willi his life had not been
taken away, or they may blame many cir
cumdances related, (whether truly or not
we cannot yet fay) of the trial, treatment
or condemnation of him. But then, on
the other hand, they are forced to remem
ber, that h's conduit had been-acceflai y to
the death of thousands of illnocci t people;
that it was treacherous anil dangerous to
the happiness of millionsâthat i- was his
conntry that condemned him, which
had the bed right to judge and could
bed judge whether his life had been
forfeited, and ought to be required at
his handsâand, that whether the French
nation judged right or wrong, in this
indance, or were governed by reason or
paflion therein, it cannot s.lfeff thecaufe
of liberty in general, and the merit
afcribecl to the French in abolishing royal
ty ; nor diminilh the anxious' wishes and

IT lias been hitherto the pra&iceof this
seminary, (as it was all along the prac
tice both of the OIJ college, and of the
old uuiverfity) to examine the fcveral rolis
once aweek-; and on every such occasion
to levy lines (except whsre corporal pu
nifhment was to be inflidled) on such ol
the lludeiUs, as during the preceding week,
liad been cither late in their attendance, 01
absent altogether; at any particular session.
Cut this praffice, however good the
deligri with which it was instituted, was
instituted, was found to be attended with
some inconveniencies. The colle&ion ol
so many petty fines was both troublesome
and degrading to the profefiors. Neither,
after all, could the imposition of these fines
be esp;fted to produce the desired effect :
for, if eonfiderable, they operated rather as
a tax upon the parents, than as a punifh
inent on the boys ; and if inconsiderable,
were but too apt to be disregardedâAnd,
as to corporal punlfhment, the inflidtion ol
it so frequently, and in so public a manner,
could not bet tend to wear oat that in.
genuous sense of (hame and regard to cha
racter, which it is one great end of educa
tion to cherilh and promote.
jSt a meeting therefore, of the Faculty, belt
JtpTil 18, 1793, l * wai unanimoujly re
fotved,
Firlt, i hat all fines and corporal pu
nilijments for attending late, or for being
absent altogether, at any particular session
fliall be abolished.
And secondly, That on the firil Wed
nesday of every month, thtre (hall be a
meeting of the several ProfelTors and Tu
tois, for t':e purpose of examining thÂ«
general roll, and compiling their ftvera!
particular rolls,when an accurate (latement
of the attendance and behaviour of each
student, during the pieceding month, (hall
be mace out. and presented to his parent!
or guardian."
The Faculty confide, that by thus ex
tending the authority of the parents and
guardians, there w.ll be the less need for
the exertion of other authority; and that
the apprehension of this monthly notice will
be lound to have at lead as mueh influence
0:1 the minds of their pupils, as the appre
lienfion of the weekly fines & punishments
were found to have formerly.

PHILADELPHIA, June 1 5 .
There are letters in town from a refpec
tabic house in Amsterdam, of the 191b of
April, mentioning that their high migh
tinefsthe dates general, will give r.o per
miflion to the American veflels there, to
take a freight or be chartered for tlu-
Weft-Indies. One veflel had been char
tered for 40,000 guilders, but would not
be fuffcred to proceed: The confequencc
is,that there are many American ships now
lying in the Dutch ports, some of which
are detained even in ballad. The letters by
which we have thi'3 intelligence, further
mention, that our (hipping, were also pro
hibited from being chartered even to Su
iinam and Demarara. When we compare
this treatment, with the detention just
before, of captain Millar, of the barque
Hope, belonging to this port, for the space
of five weeks, we are forced to conclude,
that there seems to be an intention, on
the part of some European nations, of
cramping the flourilhiug date of our mari
time trade as much as it may,
for a time, have some efre<3, but unless the
course of nature (hould be quite reversed, it
â \\ il! be in vain for all the nations on earth
to pi event the ultimate profperuy of the
United fatates ; for nature has indisputa
bly laid them out, not only as an asylum,
from the perfections of the old world,but
for the mod populous and greaieil nation
on the earth.
All theports of the French Wed-Indies

by the following decree, some particulars

it is now given at large.

" I have the pleasure to fay, the Iflanc:
of St. Peters and Miquelon furrer.dered al
dilcretion to his mnjefty's forces on the ij
inlt. They attempted to demand term:
of capitulation, which was decidedly rcfuf
ed. Had they kept a look out, with theii
numbers, and such a battery a> they have :
mounting efght 26 pounders, which effec
tually defends the harbour, they might
have given us feme trouble. The numbei
of inhabitants is 1,502 âthe filhermen ant

others are to remain untill his majesty':

which cannot be sent away, 1 think il
would answer exceeding well (if any art
so inclined) to come here to pnrchafi
them. There are also a great quantity o

The Proclamation.
A few days after the Philadelphia mer
chants and tiaders had presented their ad
dress to the President, one of the figneri
(in a large company, of which the writei
of this article was one) declared that, i,
hâ  s opinion, the proclamation required eve
ry individual citizen to treat a minister 01
fubjeft of Great-Britain with the fame
refpett as a minister or citizen of France ;
that Britilh and French vefi'els of war and
their prizes, were to enjoy equal privilege:
in American ports, any treaty to the con
trary notwithftandiiig ; and that to obfervc
a different conduct, in either of these re
t'pefts, would be a flagrant violation oftht
neutrality, impartiality, and equal friendthij.
to a.M, enjoined by theproilamation. An
other signer of the address remarked, that
the salute of the French frigate had beer
returned by some American volunteers j
not to pay the fame compliment to any
British ship of war that might arrive in 0111
port, would be fufficient ground for Great-
Brit ain to declare war against this country ;
" but, continued he, if we mufl be invol
ved in the war, I hope it will be on the
Itrong fide-"âSuch were the impression;
under which these gentlemen addresser:
offered up their incense at the President';
flirine ! !! âDoubtlefs many of their fellow
wcrfLippers were equally refpeclable, both
in understanding and principle!!!âWiial
a sublime composition mufl this fame pro
clamation be, which soars so high above
popular comprehension!!! lam told how
ever, some ingenious persons have disco
vered, and can clearly prove, that it is
flri&ly confident with all our treaties.â
It is said these discoverers mean to apply
for a patent.
War !âWar! !âWarM !
The public are under innumerable obli
gations to some of the quick-sighted cen
tre's of government, who have detedled
a treasonable plot of certain infernal in
cendiaries in this country, to plunge the
United States into a war againfl Great-
Britain and the other confederated powers.
At an appointed day all the arni3 and am-
icnala, throughout the United States, were
to hpe been seized by the conspirators :
who had formed a plan for inftaiitty em
arking one hundred tkoufandmen in canoe:.
jiJt bottomed boat;, fmacka, &c.
lorne or whicii were to have taken the
Lritifh Weft-India islands, while others
