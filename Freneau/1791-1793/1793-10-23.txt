About a year ago a decree was proposed
declaring the banifliment of all re ration
priests to French Guyana, in South Ameri
ca. A mode of carrying this dtfign int<
âexecution is now to be fixed upon. The
existing circumstances of things render ii
difficult. Breard, in the Convention, ha
given his opinion, that we ought not tc
fend such pests among our brtthren ol
Guyana.âDanton thinks, that as our port
are for the inoft part blocked up, the fleei
conveying these priests would be taken bv
the enemy, who would land the Deltilenti
al crew again on our own shores." Other?
proposed that the herd oi refraÂ£tory pried
should be transported to the Pope's terri

August 4. The BritHh government, after
vaunting itfelr the prote&or of Liberty,
has at length become its moll dangerous
oppreifor. This boaded free government
now countenances every poflible crime,fuch
as corruption, alfaffination, conflagrati-on,
treachery, spies, and treason, in order to
destroy tiie liberties of France. The Na
tional Convention accnfes the Britilh go
vernment in the face of the Britllh people;
France denounces it to all Europe, to all
mankindâ& hi (lory itfeif accuses it to the
world at large. This is thegovernment that
in .the war with I ndia, coiiiigued the In
dian nations to al! the horrors of f.imine.
i hey have tried the fdme game againd us,
and have seized upon the high ocean thole
articles ot fublidence which a neutral com
merce afford us.âThis is the government,
which in Bengal (hut up the productions
of whole provinces in magazines and
iiore-hor.fes, (whofi? gates nothing could
pen but all potent goid). By this means
thonfands were defiroyed, that the im
portunate dilirefles of the remainder might
bring thele perilhing wretches under lilt
yoke of abject slavery.âThis is the go
vernment, that,in the American war, hired
German soldiers, mere armed machines, to
be sent away like a purchase of beads, to
hed the blood of the free citizens of Ame
rica.â This is the government, that gave
1 premium t<-) the lavages for every scalp
of American freemen that they fiiould
bring in.â'i his is the government which
bought American officers in the fame man
ner as they .paid the German soldiers; they
purchased Arnold there as they did Du
mounief here. â This, finally, is the 'go
vernment which employs the treasures of
India to enslave Europe ; turns the blefl
ings of commerce to the dedriution of
liberty, and the advantages of social inter
courie to corrupt mankind, and spends the
taxes extorted from the people, in cutting
the throat?-of the French. Pride and mi
sery are the two gi-eat effects of the Eng
li(h commerce ; but such criminality can
not go long unpunished ; its reign mult
disappear before the rising luminary of
freedom. Kingly authority, by pafliuginto
the hands ol miniiters, is visibly progressing
t Â° its own dedru&ion ; and the bloody war
they againd Liberty is fortunately
nothing more than the suicide of kings. It
is not strange that the Britilh are the Aloft
active and crafty of ail our enemies : they
are ever faithful to their own principles,
and endeavour to corrupt where they can
not conquer : a i'illy vision influences their
despotic monarchy (disguised under the
malkot liberty), and Pitt fondly hopes, anc>l
expects, soon to set an Englishman upon
the I rench throne. This young (lave of a
lunatic king ought to recoiled, that in cen
turies pad his coutrymen have at different
times invaded three fourths of the French
provinces, and tho' often attended by bril
liant victories, which feeified to prom (e
un(haken,everJading dominion, they never
failed, in the event, to be difgraceftilly dri
veil from our territories.*"
A number of papei s have accidentally been
di (covered, and transmitted to the Conven
tion. It is learnt from them that the En
giifli government has been extremely busy
in (ending fp.es, emiflaries and agent., tl.ro'
the Republic, efpecialjy into the sea port
towns, to the frontier towns, and into Pa
ris. It is alio dilcovered from them that
n indigated by the Englilh
minilter for burning our magazines and
public stores, by means of phosphoric
matches; blowing up our parks of artil
lery, &c. &c. 1 hole papers also fontain
innumerable plans of aflallination by the
hands of women and refraÂ£tory prieds.
One fait is after taii-ad beyond contradic
tion, that the inhabitants of Lyons have
received from Pitt, by way of Geneva,
tour millions in ready cash, in order to
support their revolt. . The English have
been the principal indigators of this civil
war among us, it is supported by the En
glilh, and the expences of it are paid by
them. This is the honed ule their mini
der makes of those millions of pounds der
litig granted by his parliament, under the
name of secret service money. It is to be
lamented that neither Marseilles or Tou
lon have religiously flaut their gates againd
Bri illi gold, <or their ears againd danders
to the prejudice of the National Conven
tion. Intrigr.e has been employed there
100 fuccdVfuUy ; fa lie patriots, salaried a-
gents, and Grangers have corrupted the
public mind of fciiefe two cities,hitherto so
famous tor their love of liberty.

\ ou speak of maintaining the security of

and sacred of all, by disallow ing clubs, and
subjugating even their thoughts; for men,
who know the price, and arc sensible of
theii own dignity, there exitts no property
without that ; thus the order and public
tranquility which you promise at that price,
are no more, properly fpeakiug, than the
dark and cruel repose of slavery : already
the unhappy inhabitants of Conde hear
around them the frightful found of chains,
which you are preparing for them; but
under their grievous burthens, they pre
serve freefpirits, and their unhappy breth

ently the odious yoke which they at present
groan under.
Behold your blind satellites struck down
before the wails of Valenciennes; lee the
brave republicans of that citv dare the

brigands, who come from ali parts of

(thro' mercy) in having generally efcapec
the contagiousPliiladelphiafever, conlider
ing the many travellers from that city thai
were daily passing through from thence,
and even sojourning here during the month;
of Augult and September. It is with mucli
pleasure I can allure you that only three
persons in this city are certainly known tc
be down with the so much dreaded yellow
fever, viz.. MelTrs. Hudson and Goodwin,
Editors of :!i e Connecticut Coi_, ant, and a
correspondent of theirs. Who dwelleth a
few doors distant. All three of these poor
gentlemen took the infection from a cer
tain southern newspaper, which th?y hap
pened to peep into without previously fu
migating their nostrils with hot vinegar ant
taking a dram of llinkabus. They are fre
quently delirious, and it is remarkable,
that in the paroxysms of the fever thej
yelp exactly like puppies ; often, in theii
frenzy, /napping at the Cazetce that Wa;
the innocent cause of their calamity. Thai
their teeth may speedily be beaten intc
pruning-hooks and plough-shares, is the
ti icere Willi of yours, with sincere refpeft,'
&c.
Maryland papers relate, " that a voice
has been heard in the streets of Philadel
phia, warning the inhabitants to prepare
â¢ or their doom, as written in the .book >of
the prophet Exekiel, chap. 27th." They
farther assert, " that two angels have been
leen, that converted with the Watch of thib
city at midnight, on the fubjeft which the
r I O^ e .. v Â° lc f ' previously proclaimed. "
Lit is high time that men were afhauied of
propagating filch lilly falfehoods as thefej
without foundation in nature or reason.l
i\?- a S enE^ elrian arrived at Baltimore in
a (hip from Fayal, we learn, that Fayal,
as well as Madeira, and all the Azores or
Weltern Isles, were apprehensive of an
approaching famineâ their crops of grain
having nearly all failed this seasonâThat
in a few days after their arrival at the said
place, (about the Bth of August), the eo
vernor, chief judge, and senate, had called
a meeting of the inhabitants, for the pur
pose of adopting some plan to guard againfl
e expected calamity, by procuring pro
vihons from Portugal or America, but that
through party diviiions, they had come to
no resolution on the fubjeftâthat there
was not a bufliel r>f wheat or corn, nor a
barrel of flour for sale in the whole island.
I hat the principal part of thepeople there,
lived on garden roots, fruit, and fifh, hav
ing no bread to eatâthat several cargoes
Of grain or flour would barely afford them
a temporary relief in any one of the said
Fa > al being in want of 60,000
bulhelsfor its consumption alone ; Tercera
and Michael's had undergone an equal scar
city of crops with the former island ; that
veneh going to Europe this fall, would do
we I to flop there or at Madeira, as they
will have an opportunity of making sales
to great advantage.
The gentleman who gave the above in
formation, further adds, that it is a fre-
L ' uel ' t P ra &'ce :n the above mentioned
ifiands, to take advantage of ftran-rers in
calculating accounts in their currencyâ
and the exchange of specie or sterling mo
ney ; which he thinks theconfuls of diffe
rent nations, who reside in them, ought to
make known 011 the arrival of every vessel
here belonging to the coumry or nation
whom they represent.
Extract of a letter from Shelburne, to a
gentleman in Norfolk, dated Sept. 8.
"Admiral .King, with three fail of the
line and three frigates, is arrived at New
foundland, and is daily expected at Hali
fax, at which place we imagine part of ad
miral Gardner's fleet now is, though we
have not heard of them thir fortnight past."
Some scattering intelligence appears in
the New Providence papers,pnrpoi ting that
an hnglilh fleet from Jamaica under Com
modore Ford, had failed with troops on
aoard, on Sept. Bth, to attack Port Jere
mie, in French Hifpaniola-that the Eng
lilh colours were flying at Nichols Mole,
itc. [From such important intelligence
coming thro'no ether than the New Pro
vidence channel, it may, after such an in
â erva' time, be supposed somewhat
lotibcful.]

Siturday, July 27, 1793.
OnThurfday evening was decided before
judge Buller, at his house in Lincoln's. Inn
fields, a cafe of the utmolf importance to
the rights of neutral powers. Collin M'-
Kellan and James Fergufon, both Anuri
cans, and who were imprelled 011 the jÃth
;>f last month, were brought before the
above mentioned judge, by virtue of a writ
of habeas corpus, which was issued on
the 21ft ofjunelafl, returnable immedi
ately, for the purpose of obtaining their
tlifiharge ; when lieutenant Haworth, the
commander of the Enterpriz.', reru ned
that those men were natural bom fubjefts
as the king of Great Biitain, and there
'ore not exempt from beingimprefltd into
11s service. This return was fnpporied
â¢>y the attorney.general and Mr. Baldwin,
â¡11 the part of the crown, and opposed by
Mr. Merryatt, on the part of the men, whe
contended, that altlio' the men were born
fubjefts of the king of Great Britain, yet
by virtue of the declaration of indepen
dence in 7776, and the solemn recognition
and ratification of that declaration bj
treaty, and by ast of parliament in 178;,
these men, as well as all other citizens ol
the United States of America, were be
come foreigners, and not liable to be im
prtffea into his majefly's service. Tin
judge however, declared, that he could
take cognizance of nothing but there
turn, and therefore was bound to remand
them. It is a circumstance well worth)
the attention of the public, that in order
to ol.tain the writs of habeas corpus, tc
oring these men up, affidavits of their being
Americans had been made, but the return;
to the writs are not upon oath, and the
affidavits are not permitted to be read up
on the hearing, so that falfe returns may be
made and the judge cannot permit an affi
dav t to be read, which would prove the
return (which is not upon oath) to be
falfe. As the men have found that they
mult submit, a memorial of their cafe,
verified With affidavits, will be immediate
ly tranfmited to the President of the Uni
ted States, that proper measures may be
taken to obtain redress.
In several American newfpaperi, menti
on has been made of one captain Walker,
a pirate spoken with at sea, and eruifing
under French Republican coloursâThe;
public are delired to take notice that no
such vessel or captain has received a com-
million from the.executive of the Frencb
Republic.âAll coinmiffions granted to
rrench privateers have been accompanied
with the Itrongeft inftruaions 10 the cap
tains to conduct themselves like republic
ans, men ol honour, soldiers of Liberty
friends and allies of the Americans.
