READ IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES ON MONDAY LAST.
Treasury Department, January 23, 1792.
.IjiHAVE the honor to fend herewith a Report, pursuant to the order
of the House of Representatives of the 19 th injiant, and to be with perfect
respect, Sir, , ,
Your mo ft obedient and humble ftrvdTit,
ALEXANDER HAMILTON,
The Speaker of the House of Rcprefentatives.
The Secretary of the Treasury, in obedience to the order Â©f the House of Rc
prefentatives of the lqth inft. refpeftfully makes the following
r REPORT.
AT the close of the year 1790, there was a considerable furpius of revenue
bevond the objects of expenditure which had required a provihon to thai
period ; 'which furpius, by an ast of the 12th of August, in that year, was appro
priated to the reduction of the public debt.
The statement (A) herewith submitted, will shew, in one view, all the iums,
which according to the establishments heretofore made, and corresponding ap
propriations, have required and will require to be defrayed, from the beginning
of the year 1 791, to the end of the year 1792, amounting together to ieven mil
lions and eighty-two thousand one hundred and ninety-seven dollars, anu le
venty-four cents. in.rti.i- -..u
The statement (B) will alio (hew, in one view, the net produtt of all the pub
lic revenues for the fame period, according to the best calculation and estimate
â which can now be formed of it, amounting to seven millions and twenty-nine
thousand seven hundred and fifty-five dollars, and twenty-fix cents.
The statement (C) exhibits a summary of the total annual expenditure of the
United States, in conformity to existing establishments, amounting to three mil
lions fix hundred and eighty-eight thousand and forty-three dollars, fifty cents.
The statement (B) includes a view of the probable produtt during the yeai
1792, of the exiftingirevenues of the United Statas, amounting to three million.
feveu hundred thousand dollars. .
From these statements will result substantially the information which is deli
red by the House of Rcprefentatives, as far as it is now in the power ot the Se
eretary to give it.
One or two matters however, may be proper to be aaded, with a view to grea t
er accuracy. , .
There are certain instances, in which the efhmates for appropriations have
exceeded and will exceed the (ums actually expended. Hence,, the apparent
cess of the expenditure as exhibited in the statement (A) beyond the produtt o
the revenue, as shewn in the statement (B) will probably not be fountl real. Bu
the amount of these furplufles, or over-estimates, is not stated, because it is not
and in some cases, cannot now be ascertained, and it is likely to be very conh
derable ; and because also if it should do more than counter-balance the excel
alluded to, it will be fafeft tofct off the furpius against those contingent demand;
which from time to time occur.
No deduction has been made from the annual interest, on account of the eleb
purchased. This has proceeded from a supposition that it will be deemed expe
client by the legislature, to appropriate inviolably the interest of any part of thi
debt which shall be at any time extinguifhe?d, towards the exunttioa of the re
mainder. This point will be more particulariyfubmitted in a report on thi
fubjeft of the public debt.
All which is humbly submitted.
ALEXANDER HAMILTON, Secretary of the Treasury.

NOTES.
(A 1 The produce of these three quarters may be considered as aicertained.â
Tho Â«eh returns have not been received from all the ports for the entire period ;
yet so many have been received (including the principal ports) as to have ad
mitted of a calculation with regard to the reft, not liable to materia error. Ihe
produco for the year 1790, has lerved as a guide, in refpeft to the ports from
ivhich returns have not been received. ... , . . ,
(.%) The sum here stated, is altogether upon eft.mate : the time which has
â lapsed fincc the end of the quarter not admitting of the proper documents. It
-xcecds the produce of the fame quarter, for the preceding year, fifty-five thou
arid seven hundred and seventy-three dollars and nineteen cents If the ratio of
noreafe of anv preceding quarter, during the year 1791, had been app .ed to
his quarter, the lum would have been considerably greater, hut it is believed,
hat this would not furnilh a just rule It is understood that the importations
tor the last quarter of 1790, were much mcreafed to avoid the additional dut.es
ivhich were to take place on the firft day of the year 1791. And tho ,gh the
idditional duty on dift.lled spirits, might at firft view be expected to add to the
product for the quarter in quest.on, yet it is far from certain that this was the
â ffect of it. Extraordinary exertions were made to import distilled spirits prior
: o July, when the additional duty took effect, which may be supposed to have
ieflened the quantity afterwards-fo as to leave it a qucftion whether this arti
cle was more or less productive in that quarter, than in the fame quarter of the
former year. Making allowance for these circumstances it does not appear pro
3able, that the last quarter of 1791, will exceed the last quarter of 1790, in so
.freat a proportion, as any of the preceding corresponding quarters
(CI This sum is materially Ihort of the originally estimated product, but from
â¢he returns hitherto received, it does not appear likely to be greater This is
DW.ne partly taa decreased dift.llation of (pints f.om foreign materials in con
of a sudden rife in the price of molasses, and partly to the obstacles
which have retarded the complete exccut.ono. the law.
(D~| The sum here estimated, cannot, in the nature of the thing, be accurate.
It nc udesacompromife of opposite considerations First, it contemplates an
additional sum for the additional duty on imported spirits, which will be ful y
operative during the present year. Secondly, it contemplates the poffibdity
that the disturbances in Hifpaniola may tend to diminifti the supply of leveral
articles which are objects of considerable duties, and may proport.onab y dim,-
mlh the revenue. Hence about one-third of the prooable encreafe of the du
ties on spirits is added to the produce of the year 179! and the aggregate is ta
ken as the produce of the year 1792, abating two-thirds of that encreale as an
Equivalent for other deficiencies. . .
V) The fame disturbances in Hifpaniola may be expected to dimmish the
product of the duties on homemade spirits, by considerably reducing the iupply
as molasses ; which added to the obstacles already alluded to (and which u wil
require yet some time completely to surmount) cannot fail to render the real
product ofthefedut.es, in the course of the present year, materially less than
P he estimated product. Accordingly an abatement of about one-third is made in
the present eftiinate.

end thebufiijefs of the inftituVion have given
notice, that thev will pay a premium of ten gui

ihe 20th day of February ensuing, the best plan
(or the bu Iding tbev propose to have ereaed,
ind a premium of five guineas for the second

ind to occupy a space of fifty feet by seventy,
ieing the corner of Wall and Water-Streets.
A coal-mine has been difcoveied on the Le
ieigh in the county of Northampton, state of
Pennlylvania. The coal yet found is small, but
here is every reason to believe that by searching
leeper it will be found larger; the quality is good,
if this natural advantage is improved it will be a
prodigious resource to this city, and cheapen the
Irticle of fuel, which now from the labor of tranf
wtation bears a high price, 'i he Leheigh is a
branch of the Delaware. Ihe T renton falls be
ng rendered navigable, the transportation of coal
roni this mine will be cheap and easy.
The managers, and other officers of the Penn
"ylvania holprtal in this city, have petitioned the
egiflature of this Hate for pecuniary aid to com
jlrte the said hospital 011 its original plan, and
enable them to make it as extenfivelv ufeful as
he nature of Inch an inflitution demands. âIt
my be proper to add that the defion of the be
levQlent founders of this hofpiial (in 1752) 'has
aeen io sully.answered, notwithstanding various
ralumuous interruptions, as to have been the
atife ol admitting (til! May 1791) eight thou

lundred and four have died in the hospital, and
lve thousand two hundred ani fifty-nine, have

THE Indian war is very unpopular. Why ?
S.iv the friends of (he war, because it has
Jeen vnfuccefsful. No, this is not the reason. It
s becaule, ill luccels has called the attention of
People to theJ'vbjctt.
What excule have we for waging war with the
indians? Why this: tlie savage fellows make
"ar on our fiontier settlements, and kill and
calp the whites. Then eflablifii foits and gar
ifons on the Ohio, and a fufficient number of
:hofcn light troops to fcotir the borders of the
iVers, and keep the drawling Indiansat a dif
ance. Cahnot this be done ? But this is all that
:an be done. We mull make peace with them
>r kill tliemâBut we can do neitTier. It lies
,vilh them to fay whether they make peace or
lot; and in order to kill them, we mull firfl catth
hem. We mud set traps for them, or put fait
m their tails.
But why fend large bodies of menafter Indians;
ind let them know a year before hand what rs
obe done ? Why fend cannon into the woods
lfter Indians ? The Indians learn war from us,
A'hy not we learn of them ? Why not fight them
n their own way, with frflall parties, in the
xiflies, by surprize, when a handful are to be
ound alone ? Why alarm them, and give thetn
ime tocolleft wan iors from Lake Superior ?
But is the land where we go in quest of Indians,
>urs ? Is the Indian title extinguilhed, bonafde,
n good conscience P If not, what right have we
m the ground? But the Indians will not keep
heir own limitsâthey trespass and murder our
>eople on their own ground. Then contrail
>ur frontiers as much as polfibleâfend force
nough to defend themâand if our people trcf
lafs on Indian property, let them be scalped.â
Jut we want to makeJale of the wejlern lands to
hik our debts. Wedonot. We do not want a
oot of land. We have more vacant land, with
n fafe limits, than will be fettled these thirty
'ears : and if theie was not a savage on this fide
he Midifippi, Congress would do wrong to o
>en a Land-Ofiice for the sale of the lands in
:ontioverfy.
Let Pennsylvania, New-York, and Kentucky
>e firft fettledâwell peopledâand die land far
her weft will be valuable. The population in
hose Hates is iapidâa few years will fee a body
>f men in the neighborhood of these felds of blood
vhich will be able to cope with all the Indianson
his fide the Mifi.Gppi; and when that force is
iear> the Indians will recede gradually and leave
he land or fell it willingly, without bloodshed.
Let otfenfive operations cease. They are calcu
atrd lor land jobbers merelyâthey are fatally
uinons, without a public object.
But if money mull be expended to kill Indi
ins, offer to the whites and friendly Indians a
arge bounty upon Indian scalps; five, nay ten
lollars a scalp. We (hall soon fee that country
lear of savages. Start not at this propolal, as
liftionorablc. It is not diflionorable. If war
null be ciriiedon, by us, it is the mofi proper
vay of doing it, for it is the Indian way âand tlie
aws of war urge for retaliation. It is fiiocking,
t is monllrous to fend solid columns of men into
he woods, to (land as marks to be (hot at by an
ncmy in the grass. Offer bounties for scalps, and
irompt the avaiice of men, in a war <vhere no
;lory is to be obtained. Until the mode of war
s changed, our men do not fight on equal terms.
Besides, a different mode of war will be less
â xpenfive. Have we money to throw aw<v ?It
hould be ccmfidered, that while our public ex-
Jefiditures are encreafing, our reverues are fati
ng. The duties on spirits have diminished thr.
:onfumption in this part of the country to a mod
obvious degree ; while the diflurbances in the
[flands check the importation, so that the revenue
rull in all probability fall far fliort of calculati
>n. âHow then is the Indian War to be fupport
:d ? Perhapsâby hiring soldiers forâone dollar
1 month.âAll which is humbly submitted 10

* 4 And what is this Constitution, which they
pretend to give us, except a m >nfter deltiudtiveof
laws human and oivine j a worK ol offence and in
iquity : null, from the vice of the convocation of
the members of the aliembly, styling ihenrifeives
conrtitutivc ; null from the combination of the
deliberating body, a combination lubverfive of the
fir It balls of the itate, the dittindfcion of orders ;
null from the principles which it ertablillies, lince
they overturn the throne and the altar, and tend
to replunge men into barbarism by appearing to
bring them back to Nature j null from its confe
rences, dreadful consequences, of which experi
ence already presents a too faithful catalogue in
the dHorder of the finances, in the scarcity of mo
ney, in the stagnation of commerce, in the want
of discipline amongthe troops, in the inactivity ot
the tribunals, the lilence of the laws, the tyranny
of the fadtious, and the oppreflion of the rich; in
one word, the triumph of licentiousness over true
liberty ?
" lc would be useless to accumulate reasoning;
truth is too linking ; and fadts already speak lb
loudly, that the consequence cannot be denied,
without a species of felf-deception. The king
then had no right to landtion such a constitution,
of which his fandtion, already null by the defedt
of freedom, is null likewise by the defedt of right.
Ah ! when vidtorious over the Gauls the
firft Franks afl'embled in the Champ-de-Mars,
raised Pharamond on the (hield j when their war
like voices exclaimedâ" Reign oyer us, and let
your descendants reign over our children," âthey
were far from foreleeing, that at the end of four
teen ages a generation would come, whose madnels
woulo destroy the work of wisdom and of valour !
When Philip the Fair, reviving the rights of the
people, that had been disregarded under indolent
monarchs, summoned to the states general the de
puties or"the third estate, and placed them along
cvith the peers of his realm, he did not fulpect
that one day this ungrateful order would overturn
the two others, would deck ambitious tribunes
with the fpoi'ls of Supreme power, and leave only
the phantom of a king on the throne of Charle
magne.
44 No, it shall not be so : no, the French mo
narchy fhailnot perith* And lince motives which
it is impoflible for us to perceive, but which car
originate only from the violence and conftrainl
which, by being disguised, are only more cruel,

IT was the advice or I'.ic celebrated Mirabeat
to the people of America, 44 that if they wilh
ed to preserve their liberties, they fhouid avoid
European fvftems of finance, and above all, never
to fund their public debt A caution, which,
it fhouid leem, that observer had col
lected from the,-deepeft reflection on human ar
r.iirs, since the hiltory of every nation, on which
the experiment has been made, fully proves, that
a funded debt never vet decreased, but, on the
contrary, alwavs accumulated, and this accumu
lation was in exadt ratio to the oppreiVi >n of the
people and to the degree in which the government
receded from the principles of fieedom, and ad
vanced towards tyranny and despotism. If it be
refledted too, according to the axiom of Publius.
u that the exigencies of a nation are at ail timet,
equal to its resources," the conlequences before
stated must be admitted as inevitable, an-J the 1)<-
tem of funding may be regarded as the true fcciet
for rendering public debt (not public credit) im
mortal "f". As a source cf corruption, too, its
consequences are wot leis apparent : a lundeii
debt necelTarily begets a monied interest, difiinci
from the great body of the people, and whilst ei
ther the ordinary or extraordinary exigences of the
nations, place the prolpedt of a redemption of the
principal of the debt as a remote contingency, the
fu' port of its artificial credit must be maintained,
and those capitalists or holders thereof, who,
from this diftindt monied interest of the commu
nity, never fail to afiociate and interweave thei 1
principles with those of the body politic, whole
demand on the people for new resources will be
always in proportion to its sympathy with the mo
nied interelt, which has been so I
t:d by the fame Publius, 4 the foul of a nation.
But the expence of the United States is unequi
vocal to the truth of my poficionsj and 110 inge
nious sophistry in the elaborate tresÂ»t:fes of th<
financial minilter, âno exaggerated and fallacious
ideas that the recent revolution in the public cre
dit of the nation, is the efted of the present fvl
tems of finance, can destroy the force of thole
plain and stubborn fads, which prove that the
funding fyliem has already produced confluence!
the most pernicious and alarming, kittle
can be entertained, that the public faith mighi
have been equaliv prcferved by pursuing the plair
and honest policy of discharging the principal o
the public debt, as far and as fact as the adtua
and encreafing resources of the country woulc
permit, and by the punctual payment of the annu
al interest, leaving it to the free discretion of thÂ«
biennial legislature, to apply those resources fronr
tifne to time, according to the real circumstance
and ability of the nation, without a recurrence t<
intricate and complex fyitems, founded on princi
ples wholly irrelative to the filuation, feelings 01
interest of the people, and from which it has re
lulted tha r . the present public debt has been real
ized, and I may add, perpetuated to an immenif
amount, far beyond thejuft and reasonable expec
tations of the public j has been mojeover uevi
modelled, and by the aexterous contrivance of fil
cal operations, made to change hands from th<
poffeflion of the honest and industrious citizen, tc
that of the deligning, artful speculator, to whoa
it is now secured as a species of real inheritance
by its quality of irredeemability and a mortgagi
for years of the belt funds of the nation.â
Lefsisittobe doubted that the great influx o
money, and with it the riling credit of our coun
try for the last three years, has been principal!;
occasioned by those necefiities of the Europeai
nations, which produced a great encreafed de
mand for our produce, ano by the operation o
the impost, tonnage and excise laws of Congrels
which brought into the coffers of the general gov
ernment, the whole commercial revenue of tiv
United States. On the other hand, the banefu
spirit of speculation created by the funding fyltem
which has so lhamefully contaminated the moral
of the people, and is now infufing its fubile poifoi
into the fountains of government, producing .
dereliction of the fir ft principles of the conftitu
tion, and the substitution of maxims as novel a.
they are repugnant and hostile to the liberties 01
the people, is a truth too ierious to be concealed oj
denied.
Be warned, therefore, my countrymen ; and le
your attention be turned ere it be too late to pre
vent the farther progrejs of the measures to whicl
I have pointed in my late and present addiels
F.xpedi fiiortly upon the true Machiavelian prin
ciples of the minister, to fee a proportion for ad
ding to the present debt of the union by way o
farther afjumption, ten or fifteen million of dollar,
more, which, if permitted, will immoveably tÂ»
the millstone of public debt around your necks
and perpetuate opprefiion to your remote!* genera
tions. Be not deceived â¢. examine and decide 101
you rfelves : let not the voice of faction on the on<
hand, nor the intererted suggestions of men, min
isterial sycophants on the other mislead you,
Motives are Deft known to those that feel them
mine will be judged of in the result : falfe pro
feflions belong only to a bad caule. Alike inimi
cal to the views of party or of faction, it is onl;
for the preservation of the republican principle
of government on which the constitution is pil
lared, that 1 am anxious j and so long as these an
in danger of fubverlion from the infiduous polic;
of any ministerial tneafures, so long will my en
deavours be pointed to warn my countrymen theie
of; and by freely exposing the principles and ef
fedt of such measures, contribute my mite of in
formation to the public mind. In this view, ano
ther occasion will be taken to ihew, not only tha
a systematic attack is commenced against thi
very existence of republican principles amongst us
by measures which go to convcrt the body of Con-
giwTs iÂ»v o placemen and pensioners, and resolve a.,

From a late London Paper,
REVOLUTION.
They who affelt to praise the revolution in Po
land, while they declaim againlt the revolution 112
F ance, furnifh one of the ilrongeft arguments tiÂ»
the ad vocates of reform in this, and every other
country.
The abuses, corruptions, or radical defers of
any government may be reformed, without tu
mult or violation of private property, if firmly and
honestly attempted by those who arc entrurted
with the administration of it, before they become
too grievous for the people to bear.
Such was the reform of the government of Po
land j and such is the reform which every lioneit
man would recommend.
Ifthe abuses of any government arc fuffered to
accumulate till they become intolerableâif thole
who are entrusted with the adminiltration appear
anxious to perpetuate, instead of correcting them,
the people wiil sooner or later refill, and take the
buiinefs of reform into their own hands j and the
inevitab'e consequences will be a hidden and vio
lent diflolution of the old system, much public dis
order, and much private injury, before another
can be eflabl shed.
Such was the levolution in France, and fuck
were its neceflaiy conferences.
All, therefore, who deprecate such consequences,
instead of exclaiming againlt innovation, and cling
ing fait to exirting abuses, ought to unite with
firmnefs and moderation in tne temperate and
timely reform of whatever is deie&ive, and a vigi
lant attention to preserve what is lound in their
present form of government $ fur nothing can be
more certain, than that the decay of the parts will
bring on the diflolution of the whole, and that
grievances unredielfed will beget reliltance.
