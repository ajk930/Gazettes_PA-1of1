HOLLAND affords a ft liking con'raft
in favor of a free commerce. The territory
of that republic, not railing a fufficiency
of wheat for their own consumption, have
1 y 'he means of a free commerce, not only
ft fured a full supply for t'nemftlves, but
frequently for their neighbors During the
late c mniotions in Finnce, the distress of
ihe people of Paris in 1789, was reliveed
by corn, supplied by Meflrs. Hope, of
A mfterdam, to the amount of one million

Formerly an immense commerce was
carried 011 in the kingdom of Siam.
Uiilorian- attell, that in the sixteenth
century, above a thousand veflels frequent
ed its p. rts annually. But the king,
tempted v.-ith so much richcs endeavou;ed
lo er.grofs all the commerce cf his country,
by which means he annihilated, fucceflive
]y, mines, manufactures, and even agricul
ture.
About the year 1 750, Sir Samuel Pen
nant, Sir James Lowther, Admiral Ver
non, ai.d a number of other gentlemen in
.England,, wet e incorporated into a Fi'l.ing
Company, under the name of the Sociely
of the Free British Fiflierv, with a capi
tal of five hundred thousand peiunds fieri
the objedl was, the whit' herring fifhery,
-which was represented to be of so much im
portance, that several adts of Parliament
Wei e procured, granting partial privileges
Er.d bounties to this wealthy company : It
received a bounty from government of
thirty {billings the ton for all the vessels
engaged in the fifbery ; a bounty of two
Ihil'ings and eight pence on every bairel
of fi!l exported ; the delivery of both
Britifll and foreign fait duty free : besides
all these encouragements, the fubferibers,
for every Â£\ico paid into the stock of
the focietv, were en itlcd to three pounds
a year to be paid by the receiver-gencral
< f the cu(lom8, in equal half yearly pay
ments. Besides this great company, the
Teluience of whose governor and directors
was to be in London, it was declared to
be lawful to erect different Fishing Cham
bers in all the out ports of the kingdom,
provided a sum not lefsthan ten thousand
pounds was lubferibed into the capital of
each, to be managed at its own risk, and
for its own profit and loss. The fame an
nuity and the fame encouragements of all
kinds, were given to the trade of those in
fcrior chambers as lo that of the great
company. The fubfeription of the great
company was soon filled up and several
different fifhing chambets were eredted in
the different out por'sof the kingdom. In
spite of all these encouragements, almost
all those duTetent companies both great
and small, loft either the whole, or the
greater pait of their capital ; scarce a vef
tige now remains of any of them, and the
white hening fifliery is now entirely, or
almost entirely, carried on ly private ad
â¢venturers. Previous to the final ruin of
the great company, admiral Vernon, as
one of the diredtor*, waited in person on a
Mr. Martin, an old fifherman at Yarmouth,
who, by his attention to the herring fifhe
ry, had amassed a considerable for line, to
enquire of him, by what means, he, a pri
vate citizen, had been fuccefsful in the
fifhery, whilst a wealthy company, having
an immense capital, inverted in the bufi
litis, and enjoying the particular patron
age and bounty of government, were go
ing to deftrudtion, The old man inform
ed Vernon and the gentlemen who attended
on the occalion, That he could give them
no encouragement ; that inevitable de.

Â»/â¢ uiv j iiou guuv, ww a
great expence, were built on a wrong con
ftrudtion ; that their agents had purchased
improper twine for their seines, and that
the mafhesofthe nets were too large for
the lifiiery ; but that the principal cause
of their misfortunes, and of his fuccefe,
was owing to the company employing un
interested agents, whiitt he personally at
tended to a:i occupation, on the success of
which, he and his family depended fjr
bread.
The tx ravagant ambition of Louis
XIV, not only made him anxious to be
come the arbiter of Lurope by carrying
lire ind deftrudtion into the territories of
his peaceful neighbours ; but also by in
terfering in and regulating all the actions
of his own fubjedts, he wished that they
fhoull regard h s absolute will as the alone
objedt of contemplation and attention. He
inlli, u ted manufadtures, encouraged com
merce, and undertook public work?, and
yet his arbitrary government tendered
those very eft blifliments ufelcfs. The ve
ry steps he took to render the agricultural
interest fubfervicnt to his projects of ma
II ufailures, occasioned the ruin and de
ftrudtion of hoth. Notwithstanding the
numerous triumphal arches an 1 statues
erected ir. France to the memory of Louis
XIV, and the adulation of his priests, his
mistresses. and of prostitute court writers,
it is certain, that his fvftem of policy tend
ed to deftroythe agriculture of his king
lorn Independent gentlemen, living on
iheir own estates, became ruinedâthe
country was deserted for places at court
or in the army, and the cultivation of the
land was left to a poor tenantry. Smollet,
in his travels through France, faysâ"ln
Burgundy I law a peasant ploughing the
ground with a jack ass, a lean cow, and he
joal, yoked together. The peasants of
France are so wretchedly poor, and so
much oppressed by their landlords, that
they cannot afford to inclose their grounds,
or give a proper respite to their lands, or to
stock their farms with a fufficietit number
of black cattle, to produce the neceftary
manure, without which agriculture enn ne
ver be carrie !on to any degree of perfection
The peasants in the south of France are
poorly clad, >nd look a3 if they were half
I starved, diminutive, swarthy and meagre,
a id yet the common people, who travel,
live luxutioufly on the 10a.:."
The kingdom of France, although en
j -yinga good foil and a fine climate, yet
owing to the poverty and wretchedness of
the people (previous to the late glorious
revolution) out of one hundred and thirty
millions of acres which that country con
tains, only fix millions were thought to
be under a full cultivation ; the remainder
under tillage, affording little mo<e than
subsistence to a miserable tenantry.
The British na ion at present appear
fiourifhing; but the government having
adopted the oppressive fyftemof interfering
111 the occupations of its cit zen 3, that fine
country must fall a faCrifice to such unjust
principles. Some time since the Minister
formed thedefign of eredtmg a Board to
ivatch over the interests of trade. The
project was carried into execution, but
trade so far from increasing, declined the
moment that these counlellors of commerce
began to give her lessons : of this authen
tic proofs were produced, and it was abo
liflied in 1782. Mr. Gibbons, the Eng
lish Tacitus, was a member of this institu
tion. A few years since some farmers in ;
Yorkshire were impiifoned and fined to
the amount of several thousand pounds, for
cultivating tobacco, contrary to an ast of
Parliament. The wool bill, enadted into .
a law in 1787,15 a remarkable inliance of
a violation of the liberty and property of
the English farmer. The whole advan
tage of this monopoly centers in the
wealthy principals engaged in ",he woolen
manufacture, whilst the labouring nianti
fae .urers can scarce earn bread r.bove the
point of starving, and whilst they and their '
.families are daily falling on the patifhes
i for support: The tyranny and oppression
of the law does little credit to the British
government. The objed of it is to pre
vent the exportation of wool to France,
where the farmer could procure twenty
per cent, more for it than in England. By
such arbitrary and unjust reftrietions and
regulations j by excise laws ; by taxes and
impohtions of various kinds, the yeoman
ry ind independent country gentlemen of 3
or T âol. pei ann. are aimofi annihilated.
I tie gloomy eye of the Financier, rolling
with baneful vigilance in search of new
wa y Ã and means, lets neither the crops,nor
the domeftiecomforts of the farmer escape.
Agriculture will not long survive such
n.eafures ; or if it (hould exist, it will be
t.ie invidious fpeÂ£tacle of great lords, and
their devouring Rewards on one hand, and
-i m;ferab!e dependant peasantry on the
other.
When Colbert demanded of an old ex
perieiiced merchant what steps his mailer
(hould take to encourage commerce, the
answer wa9 âLet us alone. The citizens
of the United States engaged in agricul
ture. in manufactures, in mechanics, and
even in the Cod-Fijhery, may with jullice
and propriety give a limilar answer to Con
gress.

July 23. The following art further par
ticulars of the outrages of the Pariiian I.lob

the decree of the National Aifenibly againfl
the non-juring clergy, and fur eilablii'lring a
camp of 20,<X0 men to be ftanoaed round
Paris. A few moments before the mob
had filled the palace, a young chafleur, on
ly 18 years o.d, found means to get into the
king's apartment, where, pale and breath
lets, he fell 011 his knees before his majelly,
and with difficulty articulated the follow
ing words : " Sire, a horrible plot is form
ed againit your life. 1 entreat on my knees
that your fvlajefty would give l.ie leave to
remain by your tide. The king, deeply af
fected at his generous conduit, granted his
and Legged of him to be compo
sed.
The doors were then burlt open : a furi
oui 1110b in,heel in and croudeci around the
liioiia. cii, defended by tour national guards
only. An internal wretch, armed with a
] .ice, and the tire of rage burning in liis
eves, darted towards the king with a mur
c.erous intention. The young chafl'eur
1 ulhes on the lnonfterj turns t!ie menacing
weapon, which (lightly wounded an officer
oi'tne national guards, who thought him
teif happv to info ionj; as hi* king was
fate.
Sfvffral fur'e*, tu t'.e of wometv
breathed death and deftruftionâone Â«t
them armed with a poign.ard, ran about flic
qutffil's aoartmeut, foaming in the nicntb.
her eyes gHftening with rage, aiÂ»d her ha':
bridled up as if electrified, h'b" li-.j; out
these wordsâ"Where is i!ie that 1 111:17
pierce her through the heart ?" An officer
coolly replied, " wretch, do 7011 'oc fee
her, there (he (bands."
At the fight of the qtieT, this fury ~*.rn
became a woman. Her voice, as it "â e'v
bv magic, <v weak, lier hand fhrok as :f
(he were paralyzed, and die mechanically
crie'l nut ''Lu.w jive the qreen !" and
mixed â¢â¢â¢Uh " croud, covering her

Tae mob retreated, praising the soldier
for having done his diuv.
An attempt was made to separate Mi
lame i'.liv ibeth from her brother : but (he
never quitted the f art of his coat which
ihc bedewed w'.th her tears, and it wi'l
Icarcelv be eredired, that the surrounding
moijflers ridiculed and insulted her feel
ings.
Santejre, the brewer and commander in
chief of the mob, told the queen, that the
was much to blame for imagining that the
peo; le of Pari: had not the liaeerell love of
1 i-r. He obfe. ved, that the king was fi
ther of all 'lie people, who at that inrtant,
[urraa ded a glorious progeny. ! and that
no harm Should happen to her majesty !â
rhe queen anftvered, " I know I am in no
tlartger while I a::i protected by thefe-brave
men," pointing to some national guards
near her : "At the fame tjffie, I appreci
ate, as I ought, tiie merit of your aifm an
ces."
Madame Elizabeth de France, when the
mob rr.fh d into the palace, endeavoured,
but in vain, to prevail on the kit:'; not to
appear. She than opened the door her
,'eif, and placing herfeli before the mo
narch, said to the snob, ' Behold your
king, if you have evil intentions agaiuft
him, you m: ;l get rid of me before you can
reach him !"
The battalion des fils de St. Thcma.s
formed, during the whole time, a barrier
round 1 r queen, and cool aniidfc the ho% â¦
inra of thocfands of human tigers, only at
tended to their duty. The atieen, i.i rhe
ir.orr.ir.g had said to Madame, " Whathave
i to fear ? That they (hould kill me ? ic
they hare rc dived upon it, bette: to-day
than to-morrow."
It was leveif o'clock, when Rl. Pethion,
I'Mayor of Paris) uppearcd before the king.
He, helitaliiig and confufed, attempted to
vindicate the cor.dust of the municipality.
He said, that had i_ not been for the pre
caution taken by that body, It was probable

" I know," fays Pethion, " the full ex

you y.ill withdraw." The mayor obeyed.
Aug. 1. âTiie President informed the afiem
bly ti...t he had received a packet bv the poll
containing the declaration i.Tuedin the name of
the Duke of 3Â»unfwick.
In consequence cf a report from the commit
on-. of general ii.lpeSion founded upon the con
duct and threats cl the enemy, in regard to the
national jaiaids, :ho alfemblv palled a decree,
by which it is declared, " That if the laws cf

Frenchmen taken w:th arms in their hands, all
the oiliceis belonging to the enemy, who may
be made pri'.oners, f.iall experience a fim.lar
treatment, whatever may be their rank, titles, or
diilintii-ns; but that the foldierv notwithlland

The aiembly roie and voted this decree by
an unanimous acclamation."
The ad'embly palled a decree by which all
die inhabitants of France, deflitute cf fire-arms,
are henceforth to be armed with pikes, Sruilar
to thole recommended by matlhal 3a:;-,
The patiiotic Pethion appeared at the bar,
and demanded " that the king be declared to
have forfeited his crown, and that .. minittry
te .letted, into whole hands the rein- of go
vernment lhali be entruilcd unul a national con
vention lhali have adopted definitive mcalures."
This demand was applauded, and lefetred to
the coninuuee extraordinary.
\ tiierday the national alfembly direfled an
address to t e national guards of Paris, and the
guards from the several drpariments of the king
dom, ti.at have come to 1-aiis in oider to join

nothing but blind courage could induce them,

on the part of the Minuter at war. Com

malicioudy mixed in the bread intended for

The bread was prepared in an old church.
Some of theglafs had fallen from the win

with it.
u Accounts were received on authority
which we can neither implicitly believe nor
entirely disregard; that the spirit of mutiny,
as well as desertion, has broke oat among
the Anftrian troops on the Flanders fron

their officers to make the one part of them
keep guard over the other ; that many de
serters have come in ffom them with
wounds which they fay they received in a
mutiny, and that the greater part of their
companions wait only so.* an opportunity
to follow them.

unanimoully, at the commemoration

" May you, legislators, maintain, by the
indefatigable spirit of liberty, that cc.rtitu

until you can proclaim with triumphant fc
curitv. It is fini.'iied '. Manifefi. to an atten

the phrenzy of ph lofophy, nor the fever of
wild and precarious bberty, which could
produce such oo -. .iued agitation, but that
imperilhable fpsr t of freedom alone, which
always e sifts in the hearts of man, which
now animates the heart of Europe, and
which, in the event, will communicate it;
energy throughout the world, invincible
and immortal.
"We rejoice, in the security of our fouls,
that this creative spirit animates the whole

happiness and glory to the human race,
from every great event which tails into ac

scope to the universal foul of empire. We
trull that you will never submit the liber

Cod, and the right hands of the people.
" The power that preiuuies to modify or
to arbitrate witti respect to a conftitutiou

By a private letter fr~m Canada to a
gentleman i;i this town, we learn, that Lt.
Governor Sirncoe brought from England
with him all the civil officers of his new go
vernment of the Upper Province wh'ch he
governs : also a rew regiment called the
Queen's Rangers, railed for the service of
that country, together with one battalion
of the 60th, and the whole of the 24th regi
ment. amounting to nearly 1800 regular
troops : the militia of both provinces are
also tinder the ftriÂ£teft (iifcipline. The let
ter further adds, that all the Indian warri
ors of Lower Canada have alfembled. and
are on their way to join tire confederation
(which is said to be general) against the
United States ; they are to meet a grand
council which they fay arc to aflemble at
the Miami villages. It is thought in Qne
h c that the American; would five much
expence and blood filed by a timely peace,
as there never was known so general a
league of those barbarians of the wilder
ness.
The present situation of Europe, fays a
correfpordent, (hould attract the attention
of every American citizen. He may there
learn a leflon which will enable him to
judge with what anxiety he ought to
watch over the conduÂ£t of those to whom
he has intruded the welfare of his country.
When he fees the combination formed in
the old world by those who are in reality
the mere stewards of the people against
tiieir matters, though at the fame time he
ought to congratulate himfe'f upon his hap
py condition, he (hould doubtlels ta'f.e every
method in h'Â« power to insure the tranfmif
iion to posterity, of the bleiiings which he
enjoy . For the attainment of this end,
there are no means so important as a pro
per choice of representatives in Congref*,
especially at the present early period ol our
I olitical life. It is from tiie youth of a
people that their national chara&erin inan
â Ood is derived. If tiie feeds of corrup
tion are early sown, the foil becomes con
genial a" ! the crop but too abundant. The
jU. :es of government arc in thi. cafe creat
:d not for the good of the public, but for
:lie emolument of individual:; ; And in
:'r,te the modest dignity of a republic is
hrown afule for the meretricious pagean
try of monarchical !plendor. If on the con
trary the plant of freedom is watched with
rare, and the canker-worm of corruption
s never fullered to prey upon the buds of
liberty, political happiness will be left un
ululterated as a legacy to thousands of
venerations. The pollerity of Americans
â v .1 reverence the work of their anceliors,
nal the example will infpirs them with a
acred regard to the pledge committed to

MANIFESTO
Of the King of Prussia.
A Exposition of the Reafon9 whicl
have determined his Majesty to tike up Arm
agaiuft France.
(Publified at Berlin, July 24 1792./
HiS Pruflian Majesty flatters him (elf that th
powers of Europe, and the public in gener
al> vvill not have waited tor this expedition to si
their opinion on the justice of thecaufe which h
is going to defend. In 'ast, no one, who is n o
desirous of misunderstanding the obligation
which she king's engagements, and his politica
connexions impose on him, and of (hutting the!
eyes upon the conduO of the prcfent goveinmen
of France, can deny that the warlike ineafuies 01
which his majesty has with regret determined, an
the natural conlequences of the violent rel'olution
which the madncb of the party predominating 11
Franco have made h;m adopt j and of which i
was easy 10 foiefce the fatal consequences.
Not content with havingop<;nly violated, by th 1
notorious luppreflion of the rights and poUelfion
of the German princrs in Aifuce and Lorraine
the treaties which unite France and the Germai
empire j with having given way to principles fub
verlive of all social subordination, anu consequent'
]y of the repose and felicity of nations . and with
having fought tofpread in other countries, bv th<
propagation of these principles, ihe feeds of licen
tioufnefi and anarchy which have overturnec
France : with having tolerated, favoured, and e
ven out dilcourfes and writings outraging
the faired persons and legal authority of lover
eigus ; they who have seized upon the reins o;
administration in Fiance, have at length filled uj
the meafuies of their iniquities by declaring ai
unjufl war against his majesty the king of Hun
gary and Bohemia, and followed up their declar
ation, by committing real hostilities against th<
Bel gic provinces of that monarch.
The German Empire, of which the Netherland:
mak? a part, as the circle of Burgondy, finds it
iclf necessarily comprehended in this aggreUion,
But other fads have but too much juitified the
fear of hostile invafionl, which the menacing
preparations of the French on the Frontiers had
for a long time railed in Germany. The territo
ries of the Bi/hop of Basle, inconteftibly a part ol
the empire, have been occupied by a detachmenl
of the French army, and are fhll under its powei
and discretion. Incurfionsof the troops of the
fame nation, or corps of rebels aflembled undei
their auspices have aelolated tire country of Liege.
It may be certainly forefeen, that as soon ?.$ evei
the conveniences for war would appear to counsel
it, the other provinces of Germany would experi
ence the lame fate $ and the knowledge of theii
loca I polition is lulficient to /how the imminent
danger to which they are exposed.
lc would be fuperlluous to enter into a detail ol
the faÂ£ts here alledged j they are notorious j the
whole empire has been, and ftiil is witness 01
them. If ir were poflible to entertain any doubt!
of the injustice of the French the)
would be entirely removed, by impartially weigh
ing the unanlwerable arguments on this point ir
the diplomatic pieces of the Cabinet of Vienna.
His Prussian majesty entertained hopes for s
long time, that at length, after so many agitatiom
and inconsistent proceedings, the persons whodi
xedted the French administration would return 10
the principles of moderation and good sense, and
avoid the extremities to which things are brÂ»ught
It was with salutary views that at the commence
ment of the military preparations of France or
the frontiers, founded on the afjlum granted b)
some Itates to the French princes, he engaged his
minister Count de Goltz, residing at Paris, to de
clare to the ministry of his most Chriitian maj-f
ty " that he would look upon any invalion of the
territory of the German empire as declaring of
war, and would oppose it with all his forces. The
minister after receivng orders, found the Charge
des Affaires of his majesty ihe emperor,in a num
ber of representations, making known in the rnoft
express manner, that the king was invariably pur
filing the f*Qic l.ne with hit Apoftclic majesty
refpe&ing the affairs of France. The event has I
(hown how little his expectation, from these ener- |
geuc declarations has been anlvvered. But, at
1-aft, the party whole furious determinations have
brought on holiilites, could never pretend ignor
ance of his majeity's intentions; and it is to them
tn particular, but more generally to the princi
ples manitelted in the National AflTemblyâprin
ciples which attack all governmentsâtnai Fiance
must take to it lei/ the efrulion of human blood,
and the misfortunes which the present circum
itances have brought upon her, and which are
likely to increase. His Prufiian majesty noc be
ing able to remain a tranquil fpedla.or of tne wai
his Apoltolic Majesty, has not heliia.ed to
recall his resident minister from Paris, and to adi
in defence of his Ally.
Aa a preponderating member of the Germanic
bod), he owes it ado to his relations in rhat qual
ity to marchto the luccour of his co-eilates againfl
the attacks chtry have alreauy experienced, anc
with which they are daily menaced j it is mei;
under the double an ally of his Apol
tolic ma jetty, and as a member of tlx
German empire, that hjFmajelty takes up aims ;
ind it is the defence ot the territories of that mo
narch, and of Germany, which forms the lirli
motion of his argument*
But the king would but imperfedllv conform t<
Ihe principles which he has profefTed, if he dit
not exit nd the eftorts of his arms to another kiiu
it defence, which his patriotic sentiments equally
impolo upon him as a duty.
Every one knows how the French, in contemp
ot the molt lacred Jaws, and the right of the nati
or?s, and again ft the ex pre Is tenor <> treaties, hav<
Jefpoiled the German princes of their rights am
incontellible pofi'ellions in Allace and Lorraine
and the declarations that many of thoie prime
have themfeives caused to be pubiiflu-d, as well a
the deliberations and arrets of the 1J)jc t of Roil
bjn on that important matter, will furnifh proof
of the injultice of the proceedings of the Frencl
government in that relpedt, which has nt liithert
to gram a full indemnity to the aggriev
ed parties j but adopting a peremptory languag
and threatening measures, oÂ»ly offered indemni
lies altogether inefficient and inaiimifiible. It i
worthy ot the king and of the augult ally, to le
justice done to the oppreiled princes, and to ma n
tain the faith of treaties, the only bafts of unioi
and reciprocal confidence among people, and th
t-llential foundation of their tranquility and wel
fare.
1 here is indeed another end of the king's ar
maments, dill more extensive than the former
and not Ids worthy of the wife and beneficen
views of the a hed courts.âThis tends to pre
vent the incalculable evils that may result ti
France itlelf, to all Europe, to all mankind, fron
that fatal spirit of general insubordination, o
subversion of ail powert, the spirit of licentious
nels.
There is no power Interested in the mainte
riarice of the equilibrium of Europe, who can bi
indifferent in ieeing the kingdom ot France, which
lias long formed lo considerable a weight in thi
giand balance, delivered up to its internal agita
|ions, and to the horrors of disorder and of anar
chy, which have, as it were, annihilated its polit
ical exigence : nor is there any Frenchman, ;
true l< ver of his country, but most ardently de
sire to fee them terminated : any man, in fine, ;
lincere friend to humanity, who mull n<jt wi/h t<
lee a b undary put to ibis imposture of liberty, Â»J
Lindei stood, whose fadtion has led the people altraj
their real happiness, by disturbing thi
Jappy bands of confidence and attachment whicl
aught to unite them to their princes, their father
ind their defenders ; to put bounds to the un
fury of the wicked, who seek to deftro<
he refpedtdue to government, only to facrifio
on the ruins of the throne to the idol of their infa
tiable ambition, or of a vile HupiJity.
To put an end to anarchy in Fiance } to eftablifl
:here a legal power upon the effcatial bafts of ;
monarchical form ot governmentâto secure bj
â¢ his m ans other governments again# the incen
iiarv efforts of a frantic moo, this is the grand
Â»bj?lt which the king, conjointly with his ally
prop ;les to himfeii j allured, in ihii noble enter
prise, not only of the avowal of all the powers o
â ope, who acknowledge its justice and necefiity
but in general Â©f the fuftrage and good wi/heso
whoever interests himfeif in the happiness, o;
mankind.
Hi.Â« Majesty is very far from being willing 11.
throw on the whole French nation the blame 01
fliofc unhappy circumstances which force him tc
take up arms. He is persuaded that the greateli
part of that estimable nation abhors the excefi'e!
of a too powerful fadtion ; of the danger:
to which their intrigues expose the nation, am
desires aifetuin of justice, oforder, and of peace.
Unhappily, experience (hows that the momentary
influence of that party is still but too real, thoup li
the event has aheady demonflrated the inutility
of their culpable projects, founded only on infur
redtions, which it seeks to foment.
Ihe difference of sentiment in persons well
Jifpofed, however certain, is but little perceived
in its effedts. But his Majelly that, a*
lafl opening their eyes to the dreadful situation
of then country, they will /how ah the energy
which fojuft a caule ou e ht toinfpirej and that',
looking upon the troops aflotnbled on the froi/-
fiers as their true friends and proteflors, tbey will
learn justly to appreciare the fdd>ious, who have
Dut France in a combuftlon, and will alone be
responsible for the blood which their criminal en
terpriles will cause to be (hed.
