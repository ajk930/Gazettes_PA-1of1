Mr. Freneau,
AS the citizens of the United States
will fuffer themselves no longer to
be amused by flowery and pompous de
clamations ou the prosperity of our Coun
try, and the superior virtue, difintereftt'd
nefs and pattiotifm of the executive offi
cers : recourse is now had to vilifying and
abusing every freeman who dares to de
clare his opinion on public measures. The
feieft few not willing to defend with fur
argument, the ariltocratic prihciples of
government, which they are endeavour
ing to establish, they are reduced to the
wrttched artifice of millating the argu
ments of the friends of the people, and
placing the strength of their remarks on
their own wilful misrepresentations. An
inflance of this kind may be observed in
Fcnno's paper of Saturday last. A wri
ter under the signature of a Freeman pro
poses to answer the letters addrefied to the
yeomanry ; but instead of coming forward
With that difinteretled candor confident
with the investigation of trutu, he takes
Ho notice of the general principles of the
letters, which tend to (hew the injustice,
the impropriety and danger of government
interfering in the occupations of citizens.
An open opposition to ftich principles
would attract the attention of the people
to the secret designs of the party and
therefore the old ground is had recourse
to, of â¢nictating facts and drawing conclu
lions irom them.
The Farmer fays p. 14, '' Holland af
fords a striking contrail in favour of a free
commerce, the territory of that republic
not railing a fufficiency of wheat for
their own consumption, have by the means
of a free commerce, not only ensured a full
supply for themselves, but frequently for
their neighbours. During the late com
motions in France the distress of the peo
ple in Paris in 1789, was relieved by corn
supplied by MefTrs. Hope of Amtlerdam
to the amount of one million of French
livres.*" The Farmer confincs hisobferva
tion to the single article of -wheat The
above writer takes no notice of this affer
tion, but enters into a lengthy detail of the
internal police and oppressive fyftt-m of
the Dutch finance which being princi
pally confined to the necessaries of life*
the people have been reduced <o a servile
dependence on a monied aristocracy.
The writer is equally unjull in his re
marks iefpcÂ£ting France. The direful
effe&s of the splendid and extravagant
reign of Lewis XIV. is too well ellabhfh
ed to require elucidation. The Marquis
de la Fare speaking of the establishments
which took place during that period, ob
serves, that "the king's arbitrary govern
ment rendered thole eftablithments almost
useless. For a despotic power does not
agree with eminent talents, and with no
ble qualities ; a blind fnbiniffion, which is
inconfiflent with an elevated mind, be
coming then the thief qualification to
make a man' 6 fortune."
Considering that it is not only the rightj
bnt the duty of the citizens of a free inde
pendent commonwealth to interest them
selves in the welfare of their country,
the Farmer fometimcs finds leisure to com
municate his fentimen s 011 public mea
sures ; but he will find no time to enter in
to contentions and unprofitable scribbling.
For whether his errors be truly discover
ed, or peevishly and falfely kid to his
charge, the several readers mufl be the
judges. A FARMER.

uffl, the following particulars refpe&ing
the old gentleman were colledted from his
children, and others of his acquaintance.
That he was born in the City of New-
York in 1684! was bound an apprentice to
a fea-faring man, who put him to school
in New-York, to learn navigation, at
which time he became intimate with a boy
who worked at the whitesmiths trade,
with whom he amused himfelf in acquiring
the use of the hammer, from whence he
obtained a facility in working at plate
work, in the silver-smiths bulitlefs. He
followed a fea-faring life for 30 years and
then commenced the silver smiths trade,
without having served any apprentice-ship
to it ; yet in Philadelphia he has been
esteemed one of the best work man at hol
low work, in that line of business: and
there are ilill pieces of his work in this city
much efteerv.ed. He made a tumbler in
lilver when he was 94 years old.
Through the course of a long and ha
zardous life, in various climes, he Was
always plain and temperate in his eatiag
md drinking; and avoided spirituous li
quors, except once, when he was a lieute
nant in a privateer* which failed from Bar
iadocs in Queen Ann's wars, being on a
:ruize on the Spanish main, he with 50 ot
So men, made a descent 011 a village, in pil
laging of which, himfelf, with mod of the
men became intoxicated. The Spaniards
took advantage of their iltuation, and got
Setween them and the sea, and killed every
man of his partyj except himfelf and one
Dther, whom thev made prisoners ; from
which state he attempted an escape, by
:Utting out a sloop, but was detedled,and
igain put into confinement.
He married his firit wife at New-York,
â vhofe maiden name was Catharine Ch:cfeâ 
nan, by whom he had 8 children, 25 grand
children, 23 great grand children, and 3
jreat great grand children.
At the age of 51 he married his second
wife, in Philadelphia, her maiden namt
Ann Vanlear, 19 years old at the time oi
:he marriage ;by whom he had 17 chil
dren, 41 grand children, and 15 great
grand children.

cording to the best accounts I could Col

Now living 87 ; of whom the greater
nunlber reside in Philadelphiaâtwo fami
lies of them in Richmond, Virginia.
His second wife died in Philadelphia,
14th Nov. 1788, aged 72 years and an
half. He never had an head-ach ; and haa
often said that he thought himfelf in his
prime of life, when at the age of 60 years.
He was always fond of fifhing and fowl
ing ; and till his 81 ft year, he u(ed to car
ry in his hunting excursions, a heavy En
glifh musket. He was ever a quiet, tem
perate and hard-working man ; and is now,
a good humoured, hearty old man. He
can fee, hear, and Walk about, and has a
good appetite, with no complaints whate
ver, except from the mere weaknefles of
old age.
In the early part of his life he was on
two scouts again the Indians, âhe used to
tell that in one of those excursions, they
went out in the night, how they lifted up
their feet high in stepping to prevent a
noise amongst the leaves, that they took an
Indian woman prisoner, who led them to
where the Indians lay, that they fiied on
and killed the moil of the Indians before
they could get their arms, and a few ofily
cfcaped. That the Indians came in and
made a peace, before this scouting party
returned.
He knew ths noted pirate Teach, call
ed Black-beard ; that an ast of oblivion
had pafled, which permitted all pirates to
return to their allegiance ; that Black
beard then came to Barbadoes, where he
saw him ; this wag a short time before that
pirate made Im last cruise, and was killed
in Carolina.
His grand father, by his mother's fide,
Mr. Arthur Strangeways, died at Boston,
fitting in his chair, when at the age of lot
years. His father, Mr. John Hutton, was
born at Bournefdures, in Scotland, where,
t is said, there are many of the family now
iving.

FOREIGN AFFAIRS.
PRAGUE, June 20.
GENERAL Prince de Hohenlohe,
T Governor of our city, set off the
r2th indant for the army at Brifgaw. On
:he 15th, the regiment of Hertzberg,
ivhich forms the head of the Prufiian co
umn, under the command of the hereditary
Prince de Hohenlohe, arrived here, and on
the 17th, continued its route for Coblentz
As it was the firft time that Prufiian troops
wrere ever seen in Bohemia as friends, an
nimenfe crowd aflembled to fee them,
â¡ur own troops from Bohemia and Mo
â avia will follow them J they will confiii of
:cn battalions, or 12,297 men, and will
proceed to Luxembourg or Brifgaw.
Brussels, jui y 6.
It appears, from the accounts which
have been published by this Government,
hat early in the morning of the 30th. ult,
the French troops, stationed at Courtray,
retreated from thence to Mtnin, where
Monsieur Luckner had fixt hr's head quar
ters, and that the whole French Army, af
ter this junction, fell back to Lisle, where
they arrived the fame night, having entire
ly evacuated the Austrian low countries.
The Duke of Brunfwick arrived at Co
blentz the 3d instant and the firft Column
of the Prufiian Army, reached that place
the fame day.
LTLLE, July 5
The army on its march from hence on
Sunday morning, reached Orchies at night,
and encamping there, Ilaid till Mon
day morning, when it proceeded to St.
Amand.
The violent Jacobins do their utmost to
impress the men's minds with ideas of trea
son and ariltocracy, in this retrogade
movement, to which they fay M. Luck
ner gave his afient with the utmost reluiV
ance, but was forced by the minister, who
011 Friday night sent him a letter, an
nouncing the march of the Prufiian troops
with 25,000 emigrants, towards Mont
medi, with the plan of the defence con
certed, which occasioned this change of
position.
The camp of Maulde was also evacuated
by M. Delanone's corps, who are gone to
Maubeuge ; M. La Fayette's army moves
higher up towards Montmedi, and M.
Luckner is to keep the enemy in play
over the extensive frontiers on the not th
em fide, his main army taking poll at Va
lenciennes as before.
Immediately after the evacuation as
Courtray and Menin, the Auflrians pene
trated into all their forrtier stations, though
it was night, and overtook a party of a
bout fifty of the Belgic legion, who had
not timely notice of the French retreat,
being upon guard at an out post. They
fell into the hands of the enemy, and next
day ten were hung on the public market
place. The reft have probably by this
time experienced a similar fate.
Since this evacuation, the frontiers hafe
been cruelly exposed to the ravages of the
enemy's marauding parties, who, every day
commit many acts of violence upon the
French peafanti.
Numb. go.
Jxiy, 7. It is not yet known whcthei*
any part of Marshal Luikner's army will
resume the position near this city, but no
tice has been given to the peasants not to
till the ground formerly occupied.
All the inhabitants of the town 3 and vil
lages on the frontiers have abandoned their
dwellings, to take refuga in the cities.
In several places however, the peasants
have formed the resolution of arming
themselves, and forming patroles to pro
tea their harVest against the tnaraujing
parties of the enemy.
Deserters from the Auftrians are con
flantly coming in ; and out patroles, sent
out to fcotlr the country at night, com
monly return with prisoners.
Warsaw, June
We havejuft: received from ihe camp of
prince Joseph Poniatowfki, intelligence
both agreeable and important.
Prince has gained a signal victory over a
corps of the Ruffian troops of the divifiotl
as general Kochowflti.
This aiftion happened the 17th of this
month between Polonne and Zazlatv, in
Volhynia.
The cortibat, which was obstinate and
nloody, lafled from seven in the morning
:ill five in the afternoon.
The opp nents were very near coming
o bayonets, when the enemy retired, leav
ing the field of battle to the Folifh army.
Ihe Poles loft eight hundred men, and
300 horses ; the loss of the Ruffians ex
ceeds four thousand ; besides the prisoners*
and a standard taken from them.
The advantage gained by the Polish
army would have been (till more complete,
but for a check which a part of the repub
lic's troops received on the fourteenth in
passing a bridge thrown over a dyke, which
broke down and interrupted their march.
The Ruffians attacking them at this in
stant, they defended themselves with pro
digious courage, and preferred fording a
deep pool, where seven of their giins were
buried in the mud, to yielding them to the
enemy, who had surrounded hem.
The greatest loss experienced by the
Ruffian army on the 1 7 th, is attri. uted to
this circumllance. The battallions placed
in the centre of the Poliffi army, were
more or less forced in the heat of the adti
on ; on which the Ruffians advancing ex
posed their flanks. This position did not
escape the watchful eye of the officer who
commanded the wings of the Polish army 3
so soon as they observed it, they dire&ed
their artillery, and the great strength of
their troops, against these exposed flanks.
In this interval the reserve changed their
front, and contributed by this evolution*
to repulsing the enemy ; and, immediately
on this, a general attack at thc fame in
stant decided the victory.
The Ruffian forces C'onfifted of two
Pulks of CofFics, cf two thousand men
each ; a regiment of CathaHnoflaw Chas
seurs, of two thousand men ; three battalj
ions of dismounted Chaffeurg, two thous
and men J the Grenadiers of Catharinoflaw 1
to the number of four thousand ; two
regiments of hufTas of two thousand men
each ; and twenty-four pieces of cannon.
Prince Joseph Poniatowfki, who was
himfelf in every place} and attended to
every thing, has forgotten himfelf alone
in the account he gives of this action.
OSTEND July 1792.
"Yetterday we received an account of
a battle between the French and Autlrians,
in which the latter were victorious It is
faid,l2oo French were k.l!ed* and too
taken.âln confequeiicr of this defeat, th<;
town of Orchies is in poffiffiion of the Au

was reinforced by 28,000 men, lately ar

M Condorcet reported from the Com
mittee of Twelve, 011 the (late of the king
dom. After a speech of confi.lerablc
length, in which he inveighed bitterly a
gaiuft the conduct of the Executive Pow
er, particularly since the appointment of
the present Minider?, he proposed that a
representation should be made to the King
of the Condition to which the manage
merit of his court had reduced the nation,
with four plans of a decree for abridging
and controlling the royal power.
His speech was ordered to be printed.
Saturday July 7.
It was decreed on the proportion of M.
Hugau, that there should be formed a le
gion of free companies for each of our four
armi s. They then voted to the Minis
ter of M-trine, a firm of 13,131,345 livrcs,
for the extraordinary expenles of his de.
partment during the year 1792.
The Abbe Larnourette, Bii'hop of Ly
ons was then heard 011 the order of the day :
He forcibly dated the necefllty of a frank
and cordial re-union of all the members of
the legifl itive body, and shewed that on
such a re 11 ion alone depended the main
tainan eof the of the people, and
the prefervat'on of liberty. There exid,
said he, two dillinft parties in the AfTerrr
bly : these parties both accuse one ano
ther i tire one of wilhiirg for a republican
form of government, the other of medita
ting the re-eitablifhmrnt of the two cham
bers Let us denounce our paflions, let us
be united, we (hall thus become strong j
our union will be more formidable to our
enemies, than all the cannons which guard
our frontiers Let us give a great exam
ple to all Europe, and infprre our enemies
with terror ; there is nothing incompatible
except v ce and virt' e. I demand the Pre
sident to fix a day to put the fdllowing
propofllion 'o the vote: ' Let all why
hold in deteflation a republic, and the two
chambers, rife."
Scarcely had these lad words been pro
nounced, when the two fides rose, threw
up their hats, ft retched forth their arms.
Loud applauses were heard from every
quart r. Each fide approached its oppo
nents, the two mingled together, arid ex
changed embraces; signs of the utmolf
harmony and concord prevailed ; the tw->
parties swore an immoral union, and took
their feats promiscuously.
Scarcely had they finifhed when the ap
proach of the King was announced. He
was received with loud and reiterated ap
plauses. He was accompanied by his
ministers, and placed himfelf without ce
remony beside the president.
The KING's SPEECH.
" Gentlemen,
" No fpedtacle can be more affe&ing to
me than the general re union of opinion
and lentiment which has now taken place.
This re-union I have long desired, at lad
my wish is fulfilled, the nation and the
King form only one. The Conditution
will now becometliat pointof union,around
which all Frenchmen will aflenble in order
to prottd it, and the King will always
let them the example."
The President's reply.
" Sire,
" 1 his memorable epoch mud inspire
with thegrcated pleasure all the friends
of liberty. It is a dreadful epoch for its
enemie?, henccforth the nation is Invincible.
In vain tyrants conspire againd liberty."
Both these fpeechcs were received with
the loudefl: applause.
The King made some efforts to anftvcr,
but was so much affe&ed that hccould only
lay, in a tone which indicated the utmoll
emotion, " The pleasure which I feel is
delicious." He then retired, accompanied
by a deputation, and the litting rofe,amidll
the acclamations of Vive la Nation ! Vive
la Liberty ! Vive la Roi !
Tueftlay, July 10..
The ministers again gave an account of
the state of the kingdom, the moil material
parts of which were, that the frontiers
would soon be attacked by about 200,000
men, to which France had about 248 000
to oppose ; that the King of Sardinia
might be coufidered amongst the number
of her enemies ; and that they had not a
Tingle ally except America, from whom
nothing could be expedited but supplies for
her colonies. They concluded their ac
count with informing the A (Terribly, that
having entered into office in the hope oi
doing service to their country, it was their
lutv to resign when that hope was 110
more ; and that they had all delivered their
resignations to the King, before coming
down to the Aflembly
This notice was loudly applauded by
the people in the galleries.
The debate on the flatc of the nation
was then resumed, and several members
Tpoke upon it. It was resolved to decide
upon it to-morrow ; and the militaiT, the
diplomatic, and the extraordinary commit
:ee of Twelve, were ordered to prep ire
the necefiary details, in ca'e it fhoilld be
decreed, that the country is in danger.

asa declaration, which was carried almott

with which the sense of your force ought
to inspire you.
A true army is an immenfc body put

not, prevent any riot : yesterday eveniiiÂ£.
as loon as the decree was known, above
50,000 persons surrounded the mayoralty

municipal officers, who had been ordered to

tion, to the municipality and the depart

A confidefable body of the Provincial Fe
deriffs had arrived in the capital; but not
so great a number as had been previotifly
expelled. As the chief grievance was re
moved, in the refloration of the Mayor,
there was little or no appreheniion, but
that the day would pass over without any
violent tumult.
The king flill remained without mini

made, would accept a situation so full of
responsibility and hazard.

PHILADELPHIA.
September 8, 1792.
Abstract and Recapitula 110N of Fo
reign Intelligence.
The great quantity of European news
brought by the brig Adriana, makes it dif
ficult to trace afuccinif account of the im
portant events from the middle of June to
the middle of July.
French Affairs
Are in a worse situation than our last ac
counts from France had left them
It appear o , that since that period Luck*
ner's army ha, penetrated iiito the Aulfrian
territory as far as Courtrayand Mons, and
taken poflefiiun of those two places.
They however soon fell back and re-en
tered their owli territory Without gaining
any decided advantage, but also without
material loss.
Nothing of confequetice appears to have
been effected by La Fayette's army since the
nth of June, the lateff date of our former
accounts.
But Paris has been the scene 6f many
tumultuous and distressing scene*.
On the 20th of June a mob forcibly en
tered tie palace and made their way into
the very apartment of the king, to oblige
liiin to lign the decrees of the Aliembly re
lative to the clergy, and that for forming a
camp of 20,000 men near Paris, to which
he had affixed his veto.
This violent step is by foine looked upon,
not merely as the deed of a ltiob arting
' from blind and criminal impulse, but as a
premeditated fchenie of the molt violent
partizans of republicanism.
The attempt was no doubt a daring out
rage againlf the conflitution, and molt pro
bably the whole work of a mob.
The sensations i: occasioned and effeÂ£fs it
produced throughout the kingdom, prove
that a great, a very great majority of the
ration held the actors in this scene in utter
abhorrence.
La Fayette flew from the army to the
city, and his presence contributed not a lit
tle to rtfiore order. Petition is warmly ac
ci(ed of having some hand in the violent at
tempt againlf the independence of the king
in uling his confiitutional veto.
His known political sentiments, warmly
lepublicaxi, mult alone have rife to a
supposition of this riMure. Nothing like the
hi oft remote probable proof appears in flip
port of the accufatioii.
If the Jacobins are not the iitimediate
canfe of this criminal tranfaflion, their vi
olent principles and active exertions in flip
port of them, mufl <10 doubr have indirectly
led to it. It will be in a great nieafure at
tributed to their immediate agency, and
perhaps call such an odium on the party a;
in a great nieafure to annihilate their
power.
La Fayette is by some blame,d for leaving
the ariliy without permission from the mi
nifler of war. He pleads necessity in julll
ficatio'n. If he had not taken the step; he
could not, it appears, have prevented the
army from marching in a body towards
Paris.
Tranquility was restored in the capital
in a few days, and on the 30th La Fayette
returned to his poll:.
The king proposed to the National As
sembly the formation of a camp of 30,000!
men, to be flatioued between the frontiers
and the capital, as a nieafure of precaution,
instead of the camp near Paris, proposed
by the decree to which he had aiKxid his
Veto. This nieafure was adopted : A lure
ligii of the temper of the Assembly at the
present critical period.
We are informed by a gentlemanjufl arrived
froth Cape Francois, that (ome diilili bantes h.id
brokcout between the whites and the mulattoes,
about the heginningof August, which lailed a
few days, and then lublid^d.
A brig arrived from France about the fame
time. 'I he 8000 troops intended to be embarked
for the defence of the Well-India islands, were
detained in 1 ranee wh-jn the brig failed, owing
to the great ciifcoments that were prevalentâ'
lndee l it was a matter of much doubt with men
of consequence, whether they would any longer
relv on the promises of the French government;
and it was icported, that leveral gentlemen had
gone toÃarbadoes, upon some plan of
a mode of application to the Butifh governments
for proteclien ; in which cale, they had it in
contemplation to throw the French islands into
the hands of the Enghfli. This we give as men
tioned to us by a perfort who heard itfpoken of
at the Cape,

Proprietor of a Dublin newspaper, entitled,
The Rights of Irijkmen, propefes to publilh a
daily newspaper in the city of Richmond,
No. 1 of which is to appear 011 the lirll of
October next.

very refpeclable authority, that an enquiry
will commence at the next fitting of the

MERCATOR to CIVIS :
Containing further Remarks on a late au
thentic document, publiihed by the Trea
fttry Depaittfiertt, under the iignaturi of
Joseph Nourfe Regifler.
WHEN you, Civis, avow and declare
the ohjefl of the Trealury Depart -
me it in making the publication alluded to,
I pcefume you speak froth that int'instc,
accurate, and precise knowledge of the inten
tion which the Secretary himfelf can alone
poflefs.âWould it Hot have been candid
then, to have come forward in propria per
fonce, and, under the official fanclion of*othee,
declared what the real intention was ? To at
tempt a public deception through ind:reÂ£l
means, may avoid personal impeachment,
but can seldom escape detection. Von fav,
that Mercator " has endeavored toJhcw that the
contrary of what was intended, is dat."-NoW
Mercator, has simply fnppofed that it wa
intended to 'ihprefs the public mind with a
belief that under the present adininiflration
of its fifcal concerns, the public debt has
been aElually reduced : This supposition
then, as you declare, was contrary to the real
intention, and, as Mercator, is not dilpofed to
doubt your knowledge-os what the real intention Wa ,
he relts fatisfied in the admiflion that the
public debt has not been dimiiiilhed. But
Mercator has unluckily fuggefled that the
public debt, inflead ot b<>tng diminished one
farthing, has, under ur adminillration,
been augmented to a conliderable amount.
âThis you regai d as a deliberate ail of
hollility, a malicious endeavor to Jefl'en the
public confidence in yen, to drive you front
office, and, in the true spirit of a certain
junto, to grasp all tile powers of the govern
ment into their own hands.â-Indeed, my
good Civis, you discover too much anxiety,
ear, and paflionâyour zeal betrays you.
and in the apprehenlions for the reputation
and continuance in ojjicc of the Secretary
of the Treasury, manifeftly (hews the
inseparable conneflion between you and
him. Do not, however, elevate Mercator
beyond his views ; give him an importance
that he does not seek, or rank him with
men that he does not know.âHumble and
moderate in his wilhes, with no avidity or
deiire for the loaves and fifhes of office, un
connected with anj-junto, if any there be,
and disdaining the t.feof any power but that
of truth and reason, Mercator came for
ward to examine a plain facl, and to affcft
the public inveftijation of It, by a reference
to other authentic documents of the ireafnry de
partment itfelf. Wherefore then do you
impeach the purity of his motives, anil ac
ctife him of want of accuracy and candor?
You have surely forgotten the scriptural ad
monition, " to cast the beam from your own
eye before vou pluck the mote from a bro
ther's." â Remember that an accuser fliould
never be guilty of the thing he con
demns. You accnfe Mercator df cilarging
you with the arrears ofintereft from the
day the public revenue commenced, that is,
on the irt of Aug lift, i"8?, until your de
partment was organized on the 13th of
September following, and con-plain that
this arrearage of interest accrued prior to
the existence of your department; and yet
you have 110 scruple to avail yourfelf of the
life at the Whole public revenue from the
said firft day of August. I leave it to a more
plaKhble fophiltry than you exhibit, to re
concile this absurdity. Your next com
plaint is, that Mercator's standard of calcu
lation is erroneous; because lie charges you
with the arrears of interest made principal,
and the of the assumed debtâMow,
as to the arrears of interest made principal,
was there not allowed an interest upon it
equal 10 tllat of the original principal ? Did
not this operate as compound interest, cfr
interest upon interelt ? And have you not
the unbaHanced claim of rrferit with the pub
lic for trie proportion, which such an opera
tion demands. ? In respect to the assumed
debt, I a/k to know at what period; prior
to the aiTumption, the interest upon that
ceased ? 11 then, Mercator has kindly taken
a lower standard of calculation than he
might have done, Or if instead of eftimdting
upon th e prrjmt rate ofintereft on the pub
lic debt, equal to about four and a half per
cent, lie had charged a full rate of fix per
centum upon the principal of the foreign
and domeftit debt, the arrears of interest
and the assumed debt, thereby adding tb
the flatement he made two or three mil
lions more, âwhat becomes of this charge
of inacccuracy and wartt of candor ? Mer
cator's design was, to expose a plain and ob
vious principle to the public view, without
regard to nice calculation or fractional cer
tainty : that he has been under, and not o
ver the mark, is pretty certain, and may be
easily deinonftrated by figures. Vou can
belt afcertaiu the precise amount of the addi
tion that has been made to the public debt.
Whether the language and conceptions
of Mercator jullify the idea, that " to pro
vide for a debt, and to reduce it, amount to
the fame thing," will be left to the public
to determine : to whom alio it is referred,
how far, in the principles and practice of
Civis and of the Secretary,tO reduce the pub
lic debt and to add to it, are synonymous ?
The review of certain leading facts re
specting the eftablilhihent oftlie funding
system, is tod tedious and unimportant for
the pursuit of Mercator : he lias little time,
and less inclination to remark upon them ;
like another elaborate report oftlie Secreta
ry of the Treasury, time and truth will dis
cover their fallacy. Tile boalt that is made
of benefit to the public, firft, in the faring
by purchases ill the public debt at the mar
ket price ; feconttly, by the advanced price
given by foreigners in their purchases of the
public debt ; thirdly, by the reduced rate
oftlie new loans for paying off the foreign
debt ; and laltly, by the initilution of the
national bank, may be regarded as so many
ctrcumftances of little and temporary ex
pedient, producing partial or mliguiiicant
advantage or convenience to the govern
ment, and which like ail temporiling ex
pedients predicated 011 the facrifice of
justice and of principle, leave behind
them the bitter sting of future, extensive,
and permanent evil. Ihe benefits, if any,
are nearly pafied away ; the evil but beg.us
to be felt aitd underltodd. What may be
the ilfue of the public mind upon them, is
left for Civis .to verify.

Ml". FItNtAV,
Concerning the cut/cr and the mo
tives of the late calumnious attack on
the Secretary of State, I have heard from
various pefons but one and the fame conjec
ture. but surely there was never a ease
where the judgment of a fall'e accuser was
more iinpored on and misguided by the bale
pallions which torment him. for with re
fpcit to every article of his libel, they are
either fhamefully and glaringly falfe, or
what is more, are highly !(ouoi able to that
illuftriotis Patriot, Statesman and Philoso
pher. One of the charges is, that he set up
the prefsbf the National Gazette,by a cor
rupt bargain ft>r destroying the Constitu
tion of the United and that he co
operates by his own writing for tha: pur
pofe< Now, lir y belides the oath you have
taken, is there any mail who has the leall
acquaintance with the character of Mr.
Jetferfou, who can admit the possibility of
this, against the uniform tenor of a virtuous j
and dignified conduct, without a (ingle fail :
bro't toftipportit.orithe bareinfinuacion that J
lie is at heart an enemy to the Coiiltitution. !
Truc,itis said by this writer,that Mr. J. does j
not fupplefs his difiike of any mehli.'res of I
the government, and that he advised the
adoption of the Coiiltitution on the ground
of expediency, not of its perfection. But
does it follow tha; he ib an enemy to the
government fur these rcafotis ?
then nine-tenths of the people are ene
mies : for it is notorious they difliks and
speak against many ineaftires, ami that
the conltitution was adopted on the very
ground of its being expedient to take it
with its iiWperfeitions, and leave these for
after consideration. Accordingly one of
the firfl aits of Congrfcfs, on the Aiggeftiori
of the Prelident's speech, was to take lip the*
matter, and to remedy the defeats molt
complained of in the cOnfHthtioil. it is to'
be wished this actufer had gdne further in
this matter, and given us the precise objec
tions of Mr. J. Till this is done, \Ve tan-*
not judge of them.âAnother charge is,
that he is an enemy to public credit. This,
Sir, may be pronolinted ifnpoffible. He iliay
differ as to the means of fnpporting it. and
the uses to be fliacffe of it, ami may pofFtbly,
as well as others, detest many doÂ£lrines and
ptafl ces combined therewith, and yet be A
true friend to public justice, and a ftailnclt
friend to public Credit. The quotation a
bout HolUnd and Fr'&rice is unintelligible}
and (hews, by its darkness, the design of it.
If there be any foundation for it, let thrf'
letter or extract be produced, or the Atr.eti
cati be deemed in this, as he manifeftly is in
other infiances, a base Calumniator. ThÂ£
next and capital Impeachment is the hi oft
extraordinary that ever entered intO the
heart of man to conceiveâthat althdugH
the Secretary of Slate holds ia Office, and
receives a falar? in the government, yet he
will not facritke his judgment, his charac
ter, his fidelity, his oath, to measures and
views adopted by his chllcagties. Oh en-'
vy ?â thoii art Airely the blindelt as well as
the base!!: of paffioiis, or thou never would
leleft the hubieft virtue in the patribt cha
racter, for the theifie of thy venomous de
t'iaftion. What mull be the principles,
what the designs of those who conlider eve
ry man in the government as bouud 10 sup
port every measure of it, however \V I*ofig,
however injurious to the |>eople. Or incon
uftent with the coiillitution ; and Who hate
arid defame the man, who, true 10 his trust,
[0 his oath, and to' the people his ton'ftitu
?nts, honestly and boldly refufes to Confpifd
against tllefe sacred obligations.
But as the American has (hewn himfelf fd
unequal to the talk he has undertaken,â-
this virtuous explainer of public charac
ters, is requeued io undertake another,
wherein he cannot be so liable to mistakes.
Let him explain the public character 1 , w'ho'/
if uncontradicted fan e is to be
opposed the coriftittit.bri in the Grand Con
vention, becHufe it was too republican, ami
advocated the Britijh Monarchy as the perfect
(landdrd to be approached to as nearly as tlier
people could be made to bear, and no\v
would impose himfelf 011 the' periple for ;l
pifre republican, and wotild have thelii dis
trust men wlitr have uniformly supported
the coiillitution on republican grounds.
Let the explainer go on âand explain
the public character who on an occasion waif
known to km, could so far divefl himfelf or
gratitude, and revolt from the spirit of his
/latiori, as to erect his litrle crelt against the
magnaniir.OUs Chief wjio at present is at
the head of our f/fci/eftablifhllient ; and has
on lxluny free occations since, spoken with
levity and depreciation of some of the greatest
qualities of that renowned character ; and
now gives hinlfelf out is if h'e Were his inoft
cordial friend and aflrfnrer, and molt wor
thy of public confidence on that account-
But all this may be explainedâFor, if a
delicacy " equ;!i to that of family connec
tion-," did not oppose, it could be proved to
be the avowed policy of some, to make the
niofl of a great name in furthering their
political views, by holding up its (auction,,
as if" extended in all cases, and by full and
positive approbation, thereto.
This explainer will be further able td
throw great light Â»rl the combination at
tempted at the approach of peace.ro eftablifti
an efficient government, by means efficient aifo ;
but very ili;rierent from the lepubiican and fret
plan of a Convention ailing by the authority
of the people- This piece of hillOry is much
wanted ; and with the other explanations
which the American, fiom his love of the
people, trtth, and of liberty, it is expected
will not withhold, will be of vast utility.
He will then have the merit, he now on.y
atfefls, Of letting the public into the true
knowledge of public characters it trults ;
and the fatisfaclion, if he is not callous ta
reniorfe. of doing full jultice to the cha- 1
racier of the Secretary of State, by placing
it in loutraft with some which will be so
detected and brought to light. f

" E (hall know the tree by its fruits. "
1 This it as true in politics, as in a
more important faience. When unsupported
calumnies and barefaced falfehoods are the
ordinary weapons of a party, it is a prooi
that those who compose it are unprincipled
and base. A ftrikijig inflance of the depra
vity of a certain restless faction is to be
found in an aflertion contained in a Ihort
nddrefs to " The Mechanics and Manufac
turers," which made its firlt appearance in
the Independent < azetteer, and was after
wards copied into the National Gazette of
yesterday â11 is in these words, " The in
formation (speaking of certain enquiries
which were fomt- time since made under
the direct.on of the Secretary of the Trea
sury) so acquired by the Secretary, enabled
him to bring forward a lengthy report on
manufactures, to be introduced at the National
ManufaSlory."
Now, the truth is, there is not a single
propofitidn, in the whole of the report al
luded to, from beginning to end, which hat
any special reference to the "National
Manufactory," as it is called ; by which, il
is presumed, is meant, the eflablifhment at
the Paffaick Falls, under a society latelj
incorporated by an act of the (late of New-
Jersey.
The whole tenor of that report is an ela
borate efTay to call the attention of the Le
gislature of the United States to the en
couragement of Manufactures generally, b;
tuhomfoever, or whatsoever, carried on. Anc
for this purpose, a variety of proposition:
. are made; as will be seen by any body whe
will take the pains to read from page 42 tt
58, inclusively.
The adflrefs which contains the above
mentioned aflertion, is the grofleft infull
that could be offered to the underllandingi
of those to whom it is addrefTed. It sup
poses them too ignorant even to read ; foi
any man who can read may, whenever ht
pleases, deteÂ£t the falfehood, which ha:
been endeavored to be imposed upon him
But these conceited impoltors, to their ut
ter confulion, will in every step of theii
progress find their miltake. The people ol
America, of every class, can read and reafot
too ; and will discover and reject all then
vile counterfeits.
Somerimes they attack the Secretary ol
the Treasury, for e.ideavoring to raise a;
manufaElures fajler than ftiiis the Jlate of the coun
try, to tile prejud ce of agriculture. Here
they attempt to make him the enemy of th<
mechanic and manufacturing interests. Bu
what is too bad or too inconliltent for fuel
men to attempt ?
The firtt ground of attack is indeed no
better founded than the last. What wouk
be the difference to the farmers, at this ver;
moment, when rheir surplus prodn&ions ar<
fliut out of every port of J-.urope, by bac
markets, if the country abounded in me
chan.cs and manufactures, to consume thai
surplus, and give in exct'ange the produc*
tions of their labor, inllead of the foreigr
articles which now render us tributary ti
foreign workmen ? The answer to this
queltion is palpable. And the experience ol
th. country, like that of every oiher will
prove that the full profpenty of agriculture is in
feparablefrom thai conflant, Jleady and domejlu
market for the products oj the Jolt, which can alon*
arise from aJiounJhing of manujadures, con-
Jequently from a numerous body oj mechanics am
manufacturers, as consumers ttf the surplus oj thi
farmers labor.
This is one of those eternal truths which
mult for ever confound the vain reveries ol
political quacks. DETECTOR.
August, 23, 1792.
Mr. Printer,
WHEN Detcflor pompously comes for
waid with accusations of calumnly and
falihood, he Ihould be w. II acquainted with tht
ground on which he himlelf Hands. Having with
many others, been confuhed on the questions pro
posed by the Treasury to the mechanics and ma
nufacturers of Philadelphia, I do know that every
part of the address published in your paper of Sa
turday, the iSth inft. and signed A Mechanic, is
itriCtly true. Should Detector, in reality, have
any doubts on this subjeCt, and will come forward
under his proper signature, some faCts fliall be re
lated on this subjeCt, which even the scurrilous a
buse of an anonimous writer will not jultify,
we believe fume of the gentlemen who were made
instrumental in procuring the information for the
Secretary, were not, at that time, aware of the
use to which it was applied. That Certain gentle
men, high in office, and particular fiiends of the
Secretary, made personal application to their fel
low-citizens to procure aniwers to certain leading
qucltionb, respeCting their various occupations
every mechanic and manufacturer can teftify :
that the information so acquired, constitutes the
most valuable part of the Secretary's report on
manufactures, will appear by the report itfelf,
from page 42 to 56. That the Secretary and
DiJER were particularly aCtive in procuring the
eifablifhment of the national manufactory in Jer
fcy, many members nl the legillature will declare,
who feel thernfelves fufficiently mortified for hav
ing allowed fhangers, to influence their govern
ment, to enaCt a law, which, lor injultice to their
citizens, is not to be equalled by any on record.
These circumltances being well known, I heartily
unite in opinion with my brother Mechanic, and
think it ncceffary that the mechanics and manu
facturers Ihould inquire, what advantage citizens
pcrfonallv engaged in manufactures, or out coun
fry, will derive from the establishment of na t,ona
manufactories, wholly supported, and at the
redtion of a monied interest.
We do not think it neceflary to take notice of
the abulive language and sophistry of Detedlor :
our only objedt is, to come at the truth, by a full
111ve(Iii'ation of fads. Besides, as it is the opinion
of DeteElor, that the mechanics and manufactur
ers in Philadelphia can redd t and do begin tc
think for rhcmfelves, the oblervations of a Me
chanic and Detedtor being impartially published
in the fame paper, they will judge for themselves.
If it will be any fatisfadiion to Detector, hÂ«
will be informed, that the hatters have already
onited themselves into a society, as mentionec
by a Mechanic j and it is expedted several other
ccupations will do the fame. The manufactur
ing interest fcverely feel the weight of the new
tyftem of taxes in the neceflaries of life, and the)
are justly apprchenfive of further impositions.
