WEDNESDA Y, March 20, 1793.
- French nation. From this and other ii
t stances, it appears, that however high the
Secretary's regard for public credit may
he, there are other coniiderations which
have obtained a higher degree of his at
- tenTion, than a'o die.ice to the laws. A
gentleman from Virginia has so cleariy and
aaly explained thenatureofthatdifcretio; -
I ary 1 power with which the Secretary is vcf
ted, and so fully proved that there was no
. leceility to juftify a departure from tin
' appropriations made by law, that it is not
necefiary for me to explainfurther on that
'l head. However, I cannot help remarking.
that the discretionary powers were
a freely exercisedâThe drawing of bill,
began early, indeedâand were continued
to a recent period : The times of draw ini
fortunately corresponded with tlie necef
l.'ties of the bank, and the power of em
pioying agents was pretty freely, ufexi :
I'h j (air.e :Â» .ents were frequently both the
fellers and the pnrchafars of tiie bills.â
Perhap,this was neccifary : No douht it
I wai convenient : Probably it was Tafe ;
but \\ iio can fay, it will be always so ?
t I have not said so much to prove the
truth of the facts expressed in the refuluti
o;i; for, of this, there can be no d<;ubt .
iitis as clear a; the-fun fliiciug.in day-light,
i hut, in order to prove the propriety o

from the lateness of thi- discussionâthat it
â  was obtained with diiaculty. is evident.
; from the numerous nppii :3tio.is we were

Mr. MADISON next rose and ex

colleague (Mr. Giles) in propofirtg the re
solutions, to remark that the lateness of
the day to which they had been poflponcd
did not juftify the ftr'n',hires which lir.d been
made on it. If the delay was not to be
co .lidered as lome blame at
iea.!i would fail elsewhere. The enquiries
in which the whole buiinefs originated,
had been moved by his colleague and pas
sed the House fouie v. cexs ago. The re
'ports in ailfwer xh these enquiries had not
tieen finally ma.'e and p.' ired a (ingle day
- before the prc'fent refulutkms were fub
m.tted to the house. He admitted that it
might have been impracticable to report
t:iâÂ» information Called lor as early as was
denred by the house ; He v. a ,'i-nJible of
thtf anxi. ty that,would be natu - lly felt by
t i _r called tip â¢ to j-rc-fent every
coiil.deration that might place his conduit
in ill â  v,i >11 :'iv vurable point of view ; yet
with all t . 'fe ill iw. n- es it was impo(Ebk
| to deny t'-. it the r.-ports contained thing
which did not h-. io:ig to them, and t'here
fore ior.frncd tine which belong-< 1
to the period for difcuffiott: I'e would
mention our iuftanceon which there conid
lotpodvbly be a difference of cpipion, viz :
the vindication formerly undertaken by
the Secretary, oi'thr policy of b -.rrowrng
money abroad. Whether this policy w.-
right or wrong, the i?gifl-jtura had theiu
felves decided in favour of itand it mi:
the duty of the Secretary in complying
with the orders of the house, to inform
the houfe,how the law had been executed,
lot Why it had been made; to-exphiin hi.;
own conduct,not to juftify that ol the le
gislature.
It had been a Iked why the call for infor
mation had not been sooner made ? The
ailfwer was obvious and limple. 11 was
not sooner perceived by the house, that
there was such a nectffity for it. The
\\ lit of information was firft fuggefled
by the bill fir p ivin.g 2,000,000 of dollars
to the bank, altho-'200,000 only were im
mediately due, and for authorizing another
foreign loan to the amount of 2,000,000 :
From the dawn of light thrown by some
circ.imftanccs incident to the occalion, on 1
the darkness in w liich the House had re- 1
mained, proceeded those doubts and en- 1
quiries which had led to the information 1
now poirefl'cd. His colleague had great 1
merit in having brought about this deve- 1
lopement. He had rendered a service 1
highly valuable to the legillature, and nc <
less important and acceptable to the pub
lic. One good effect of the information t
had been, that it prevented the palfage of
the bill for borrowing 2,000.c00 of dollars t
as an anticip ted payment to the bank. <â 
The bill bad dropt from the hand of it
palion with the lirft light that broke ii
upon the house. What other nieafure
â¢voir d have been prevented or varied, if :
like knowledge ol our funds and finance
liarl been C â¢.r obtained, was matter o
fclious Â«*nl:den ttotj.
-â  :other tonfeqceiKe of the reports ta
I;. 'I together, was that the face of then
p fen ted to his colleague, an evidence o:
charges contained in the refolntions
v, he ther at foJLte a day it was belt tc
isave the fubjeit as exhibited by the varf
o:is document- in print, for the exanimate
o i and opinion of the public, or ro press ii
o i the cc!:::derat:on of the house, was ;
point which every member had aright tc
decide for himfeif. His colleague hac
viewed the politions stated in his inotiot;
as too important to be suspended*; and a:
fupportcd by Inch clear and authentic
proofs. that a small portion of time would
I'tiiiice for the subject. Under this impref
i.'oti, what was his right became ins duty ;
\! he had difcharped it by offering his re
iViittions to the House.
As the HojiXe had.refufed to commit the
: #o introductory resolutions which eltab
filed t.'ie'ruleol judgment to beapplied to
tile cafe, and the I alt alio, which declared
. : ie inference to be drawn, the talk of the
: amniiltee was limited to a liiuple enqui
ry into the facts Hated .They were to
wake out and report a fpecinl verdiit ot
caefe, and leave it to the House to pro-
I'ounce the proper judgment ariling from
them.
The refoiution immediately before the
committee in poi red 'â  that the Secret.iry
"i tile rreaiiuy id violated .lie. law pas

The questions here are questions of fact;
and whatever quality may be attached by
diiferent gentlemen to the several feds, it
would feein as if the facts tliemfelves are
too clearly supported by the reports of the
Secretary, and the documents attending
them,to be denied or controverted.
The law of August 4, j-00, authorised
the Prefidept to catife to be borrowed
12,000,000 of dollars to be applied to the
foreign dgbt of the United Stat cs. A sub
sequent law of August 12, 1790, authorised
mother loan oF2,coo,cgo of dollars, to be
applied to the domeitic debt of the United
States.
A power to make these loans was dele
gated on the 28th August 1-90, to the Se
cretary by a general commission in the ufu
il form, referring to the several aits above
mentioned ; but without any farther dif
.riminataon of the loans to be made. As
:he law however for applying loans to the
â 'oreign objefl was prior ill date, the pre
emption would rather be that it was to
lave a priority of execution ; that the ilt
noncy borrowed was to belong to the ift
ibjeit provided for. It was nnnecefTary
lowever. ro dwell on this conlideration,
lecaufe the Preside.it had removed nil 11 1-
rtair.ty by the precise explanations and
iiitructions which accompanied ;he power
o the Secretary, and which ought in truth
o be deemed a part of the commission.
The inftruftion having been more than
nice i't ad to the committee, he would con
ent liiirif.lt with referring to it. [The
â¢ a t referred to is in the following words ;
' I do hereby make known to you that in
he execution of the J aid trujt, you are to

be found needful and conducive to the ir
terelt of the United States.""] By-thja for
iUal ast ifliiecl along with the comrniliioti.t
the Secretary, the Prelident delignated th
object to which the loans to be made, wer
to be applied ; and by declaring the objei
to be that provided for by the ast of A tic
4, 1790 he expressly placed the loan, un
.ler the authority and purview of that aÂ£l
so that the moment the. money ihouid b
borrowed, it was toftand leg illy approuri
ated to i:s fpccifted object ; as much -is i
another la\v, authoritmg another 'can, so
another purpose, had not exilUd.
This arrangement of the PreGdent wr.

ture, and the payir.e.irpt the French debt

jbecaufe payments to France were no long
er matter of option, but c. j.s-IcC and po

ding to this balance, the indalments du
for 179 a, ar, ounung to 638,888, there
were to be paid within that year i,cEo,i 8;

Here he adverted to and read a para
graph in the report of the Secretary', pagt
16, where in allulion to the measure o]
:lrawing bills in the latter part of 179;
:ie fays, " 1 felt myfelf the more at liberty
.0 do it, becatife it did not interfere witi
t complete fulfilment of the publicengage
ncnts in regard to the foreign debt. It
:ould be done consistent with a full rtini
nirfement of all arrears and instalment
which had accrued on account of that
iebt." Mr. M. cbferved that as he could
lot reconcile this paragraph with the cal
. illations which he had:t.i:ed,& which were
Irawnfromoificial documents, he mult re
gard it as an unqueftionabte error produ
ce! by some hally view ol the fubjcct.
Returning to the comniiffioo, Mr.
cpeated that all the money which that
imminent, defined and qualified by the
nflruftion anntÂ«ed to it, authoriftd the
lecretary to burrow, was actually and
pecifically appropriated to the payment 1 f

TRACTS are stubborn things, and neither
A to be talked nor voted way. The pub
lic mind is returning with frefli emotion to
the enquiry into the Treasury adminillra
tion, which wasarrefled for a moment by
the tumultuous voice of an interested fac
tion, and the triumphs of a legillative ma
jority, which decides nothing, or by con
demning the authors will doubly condemn
the objeÂ£h
The tone of conversation is rapidly
changing. Even the einiffarics of specula
tion, who haunt the co.Teeh mfes, and bab
ble in the streets, begin tofoften their note,
and to feel the reverberating force of
truths which tliey can no longer elude or
refill.
Could it be otherwise ? Fair argument
was offered. How was it refuted?âBy
sophistry and- evasion. Clear proofs were
ftateel. With what were they opposed?
With detecteel calculations and unfounded
affiercions.
On the fide of the minority, appeared
temperance, order, and dignity. On the
lide of the majority, w hat ? A precipitancy
that confirms fnfpicion; a contempt for de
corum, under a pretended zeal for " Or
der and the joint outcry ofÃank-Di
reftors, (titling the utterance of truths uiott
interelling to the public ear.
The fubjeft is again bef ore the public,
and there are dilintereded men who will
examine and judge for themselves.
It is the character of truth to be firnple
and confident. Error and wrong forever
entangle and betray themselves by theii
own contradiftidns.
\Vhil!t the Secretary was preparing hi;
correction of the Errata, which made hi!
printed ftatefnents unintelligible or delu
live, his unlucky champions were trumpet
ing them as clearer than the fun at noon,
and reproaching the blindness of all noi
equally gifted with this new species of se
cond-light.
The Secretary acknowledges the free
doms taken with appropriations, and strive:
to workout an apology rather than ajulti
li ation. His advocates, on the contrary,
maintain that his measures have beer
ftrictty conformable to law.
The Secretary declares himfelf "com
pletely refponlible in all instances, whert
Ipccial exceptions, (to wit, inltru&ions fron:
tlie President) do not appear.'''' His unwary
advocates leave him ultimately behind the
fcreeu of inftruÂ£tions from the President
xvhijh do not appear.
The Secretary admits that a full view oi
the public monies and funds had . ever beer
rendered to the legillature ; and is content
with an attempt, (an auk ward one. to be
lire) to throw the blame from himfelt 01
the legifljture. His reprcfentatives have
so far mi (taken the interest of their conlli
tnent, ai to affirm, some of them, that full
information was given ; others that theie
giflatnre had no right to it.
The greatelt folly of all has confined i
?xpefting that such a ti title of contradiction!
:ould divert an enlightened people froix
demanding a fair account ot their finances
and of the execution of the laws appro
priating their money.
Why, they begin already to repeat, wh]
'lave the laws of appropriation been fport
?d with ? Why have the Inttrudtions of the
President, in pursuance of law, been in
fringed and affronted ? Why has a gallant
nation in the friendlhip of liberty with the
United States, been kept out of the money
:lue to them? Why have immense film
icen drawn from their legal situation, and
Icpo.lted in the bankâunder a reprefenta
ion, when one purpose is to be answered,
hat it might be paid to the bank, not lie
lead to the public ; under another pretext,
.vhen another explanation is requilite, that
t will be absorbed in the uecefiary expen
litnres of the current quarter ?
Why, it is again demanded, have the
longrefs been kept in the dark ? Why ha
he President been Kept in the dark ? Wh)
lave the commifiioners of the Sinking Func
jeen kept in the dark ? Why have bank
tirettors, and the favourites of bank direc
ors. beÂ» n alone deemed worthy of the fe
.rets of the public money ?
The boalted difference between a free
government and a Tyranny is, that the for
mer is a government of laws, not of men
Appropriations of money are the laws thai
liould be held mod sacred. So they are
.â iewed by theConflitution, which has made
:heir inviolability the palladium of libertj
g.iinft the greatest of all dangers, the dan
ger ot' (landing armies.
A precedent therefore, which invade;
ippropriations of public money, is the mof
ilarming that coulel be exhibited in a younj
â epublic. That it should have been co
;val with the firftaeis of our Fiscal Kiltory,
s an omen lingular as it is menacing.
This wanton infraction of legal appro
bations is marked with every additions
colour that could slain the tranfaClion.
Belides being a breach of the law, with
out even the plea of necessity, it was a mofl
flagrant attack on the dignity and authority
of the President.
It was a breach of public faith folemnl)
plighted.
It was levelled against: a nationwhei
had aideel us in our struggles for li
berty, and needed our aid in "niggling for
her own : who enjoys the gratitude and
affection of the people e>f America, and
whole glorious cause is dignified with the
hopes, and hallowed by the prayers, of
every human being that groans under the
chains and scourges of despotism.
Are other aggravations wanted ? Behold
them in theftudied concealments from the
representatives of the people, and the spi
rit of contumacy when summoned to give
information.
Trace them in lending the public money
to the Bank without interest, anil borrow
ing money at the fame time from the bank
â with interelt.
Do y-'.i v.'iih to go farther ftilf ? Vol)
muli do what a most responsible represen
tative [Air. F.j was hindered from doing ;
you mull compare the dates of these fifcal
manoeuvres with particular bubbles ci spe
c 111 ;tion, and with the well known parox
y'.ms of the bank.
And if you are defiYous of unravelling
the whole plot, and understanding all its
curious incidents, you must open the trans
fer books of flock, and the discount books
of the bank ; and compare with these the
names, and dates, an.l v otcs, to be found i:i
yotir public bodies.
How afflicting the fpeflacle! Inthe in
fancy of a republican conllitution, are dil
clofed the distorted features of a;i old
monarchy, worn out with debauch anddif
eufe. The mylteries and obliquities of its
lifcal operations are copied with an admir
ing servility. The subtle virus of pecuni
ary influence is inoculated into the vitals
of the government. Even the outlandiih
dialed of political craft is wickedly mi
micked by the venal pens of newfpapcr
partizans. Enquiries into abuses are nick
named an Oppolition. Oppolition is a pur-
Tuit of office. Patriotism ishypocrify. In
[he thirst of power and the base arts of
"eeking it. human nature is, with them,
universally the fame. And in this refpeel
jnly is the doctrine of Equality admitted
;o be true.
Americans, you owe your liberties to ?

" Since our arrival, there has been a grcal

400 were killed, as many taken prisoners,
and a great number dispersed. A granc
house belonging to their general, whicl
they had built for him, fell into the hand:
of the \\ hites ; and I am told it was as e
legantly finifhed and furniflied, as if it hat
belonged to the firf> planter in the colony.
The plains are cleared to the extent of 21
leagues, and the Hacks driven back to the
mountains. It is expeflrd that a numbci
of the planters will very shortly return ti
their desolated eflatcs. There was a great
infurreition of the mulnttoes here in the
beginning of December; they demanded 10

Extract of a Liter from Lisbon, dated Fe

Capt. Deliart.)
" The poll brings this day a certainty of
die execution of the king of France, on
the 2i ft of January Jail, between 10 and
11 o'clock of that day. It is said he flip
ported liimfclf with great cour. eon the
Dccafion ; mounted the fcaffold with cod '
deliberation, and attempted to make ;Â»
speech which tended to his i nocence ;
however, the troops were ordered imme
diately to beat their drums and fund their
trumpets, i.i order to prevent his being
heard ; which he perceiving, inaddi a re

head on the block, which wa.< in mediate

where the head and trunk \\ ere thrown,
then filled up with' earth, and jived. As

thrown in the air, and it is f id the t x.

" The queen and the king's (if . Â»re

In addition to the above, Capt. De Hart
mentions, that previous to his leaving Lif-Â».
bon (which was on the 9th of February) a
number of French royalists there hrd put
dii mourning for the king, which is a proof
that they confidercd the news, as brought
by the post, true.
Captain Boys, of the fiiip Perfeveranee,
Â«ho arrived here 011 Saturday last, after a
passage of jQ.c'qys from C-Uijltar, nseati-,
ons. that a few days oeforir l.e f.ileri a re
port prevailed, that officiallntelligeiice had
been received by General Boyd, the com
manding officer there, that the king of
France was beheaded on the 2 i-ft of Janu
ary. It was, how ever. :.fterw ardi under-
Itood, that no official accounts had been
received ; but that information to that ef-
I'eft had reached Gibraltar, thro' a channel
ol private correspondence : it can there
fore be confidertd, by no means, as a con
firmation of our foi jner accounts.
The following is an extract of a letter
brought by Capt. Boys, dated Gibraltar,
Felj. 12.
"We are fiill in a {late of uncertainty
with refpeft to peacc or war ; tut now the
unfortunate ki: g of France is no more, ha
ving been put to death 011 the 2ill ultimo.
We il all foe n know what determination the
powers of > nrope will come to. Spain
has agreed to join Great-Britain and h oi
land againfl France, and is making g; eat
preparations for war. The Aljerines
have declared war againfl the Dutch, be
ing difpleafid with the last presents they
sent them. \\ e have a strong squadron erf'
Portuguese men of war here.watching the
Algerines, so that there is no danger oj \ ef
ftls tmder American colours coming to
this place."
An abuse, existing in that frate, is much
complained of in some Mafiachufetts pa
pers, that seems to require redress ; \
the power given to a fheri'i", upon the oath
of onepcrfon, to order a freeman for cer
tain offences, (filch as breaking jail, or tin?
like) tobetied up. stripped, and flogged at
a whipping post, without even the form of
trial. "It may be w ell worthy ofour at
tention (said Governor Hancock in a late
speech to the legislature) to investigate the
question, whether the infamous punifli
ment of the public whipping post, so fre
quently administered in MalTachnfetts, is
the belt means to prevent the < ommifiion
of crimes, or abfoiutely necefTary to the
good order of government, cr to the fee 11-
rity of the people. It is an indignity to â¢
human nature, and can have hut little ten- '
dcncy to reclaim the fufferer." Certain
ly, the punifliment is infamous enough
when legally inflicted; Int becomes an
outrage on the political and social condi
t tion of /nan when inflicted by the arbitrary
order of a fheriff, who then becomes to all
intents and purposes a despot.
It is mentioned in a letter from Burling

mentioned in the Lisbon accounts of t':i

Neither w.i< there any well grounded ex

only four days after the date jult menti

The Roman Catholics of Le'and have

Let the following document ,declare it,
which the reader may elepend i.pon as de

"The plan of the emperor and the king
of Pruifia for the campaign of tjj; was,
if pofiiblc, to prnetrate as far as Paris.
W/ien the army had entered Paris, tlie in -
habitants were to have been alfembled on
the commons. A difcriinination was then
to be made : the revolutionists were to be
t 'put tix death. The particular fate of the
rcit \v:u not exprefsiy mentioned. Very
probably however, the fyfVem of the rmpe
ror was to be adhered to, who, in his uia
nifeitos, luid ordered all his governors ot
to tiis not to ipare any, on the least ap
pearance of revolt, except won:en and
children, and in cafe of illegal opposition,
to burn all the public stores, magazines of
powder, &c. awl set fire to the towns, as
it was thought proper to leave the country
desert rather than inhabited by revo/tcrs.
Such was the language of the combiner
kings. Jn all cases, the houses of the re
volutionists were to be delivered up tc
plunder, and such floods as should chanct
to be saved were to be confifcated to tin
use of the king. There was also an agree
ment between the combined courts not t<
receive into their dominions any republi
can revoli|tionitt; and the lilt of proscrip
tion was lb be extended to those who hat
a/ter a certain time removed into foreig'
countries ; and finally, that war was to bt

whether even this is any thing more than s

be feared too, that the general contempt
into which he will soon fall, will by irrita
tinghiin, take away even the little pood
that is in him. lc is certainly a great
weakness in a man who is devoted to the

or delicacy, to be anxious to throw the
veil of lecrefv over everv thing, in a poll,
where it is next to impofiible that any

unnatural to him. He hates the one be

Late on Monday evening arrived lieri
the ffcip Trial. Watts, from Lisbon, w hicl
port (tie left the -th of February.âEnglifl
papers had then been received at Lifbo
giving the particulars of the trial and exc
cution of Louis the XVlth. By th;
Trial. London papers are received to tht
22d of January. In the feflion of the Na
tional Convention of Jan. 15. the firfl ques
tion was put, " Is Louis guilty or not guil
ty of high treason, and of attempts againfl
the general fafety of the State ?"âThv
nominal call being begun and terminated,
the President of the Convention thusfpoke
â" Out of 735 votes, 26 have had leave oj
absence ; fi\ e have been absent by illness ;
one for cause unknown; twenty-fix have
made divers declarations ; and fix hun
dred and ninety-three have voted for the
qucltion in the affirmative." The Presi
dent then pronounced " Louis Capet guilt)
of high treason and of attempts againfl
the general fafety of the State.â
The second question was then putâ"fhali
the appeal to the PEOPLE take place ?
The sentiments of the members were di
vided on this question, the saving of the
king's life being thought a certain prelude
of a civil war. M. L'F.galite (ci-devant
Duke of Orleans) who had before voted
the king guilty, now voted also against the
appealâa majority of 280 appeared again!"
the appealâThe President then rose a se
cond time and pronounced as follows :
" The national convention doth decree thai
the sentence which it (ball pionouiice upoi
Leuis Capet, shall not be referred to tilt
appeal of the people."
ExtraCi of a letter from Paris, January
17, 1793-
"The National Convention, after fit
ting 34 hours, has just voted that the pu
nishment of death shall be inftifted or
Louis the 16th. This sentence was carri
ed by a majority of more lhan one hun
dred. Fifty of the members tho' they vo
ted for death, differed in opinion from the
rt'lt in refpeft to the time when it fnould be
inflicted, some thinking, it fliould not be in

proposing that it should be postponed till
the sense of the people should be taken â
Amazement and terror appear universal

imagined than described. So great was
the general terror-dnring this long fitting
of the convention, that the men; -

the king, if poifible,found themselves com-*."

sonal fafety, to vote against Jiim. âThere
undoubtedly \yas great renfon for this ap

London, Jan. 15. The funds rose yes
terday near one and a half per cent. This
Teemed clearly to indicate the opinion of'
the market to be favourable to peace : but
why this opinion prevailed we are ignor
ant. We believe it proceeded entirely from,
the utter incapacity of the public to disco
ver an adequate reason fer going to war.â
Lord Grenville in his anfvver to M. Chau
velin slates the conquers of the French in
Savoy, in Rrabant, and in Germany not
precisely as aggre'flions, but as proofs of a
spirit of propagating their doctrines in
manner highly offenlive to the peace of ail
neighbouring nations ; and that, if they
expett neutrality, they mtift forego tbofe
cOnquests, and withdraw their troops with
in their own territory. If it be true that
such propositions have bÂ»Â»n made by the
British court, it is not likely that they will
be cordially received, unless they have been
accompanied with our offer to recog
nize the republic, in cafe they are compli
ed v. ith, and no offer, we understand, has
been made.
There is no doubt but the temperate and
manly cotirfe, becoming the dignity of the.
British people, would have been to have
treated with the French ministers frankly,
instead of insidiously, and every object
which we have a right to demand, would
have been complied with, if allied for
without insult; for through the whole re-,
volution they have made it their (ludytft
engage the friend/hip of England.

The general concern that seems to agi
tate the citizensof theUmted States, at the.
accounts (still somewhat doubtful) of the.
traitrous and perjured Louis the XVlth,
the inveterate enemy of his people, having
loft his head, is a convincing proof of a
strong remaining attachment to royalty in
this country. Lut is it pofiible that preju

publicans, who in the time of their own
Hruggle for liberty were perhaps less in
clined to pardon crimes .Â«f tr; afon than
the French, especially in the infiances of'

Indeed, Sir, my mental powers are not
fufficient to discover any injustice in the
war, and I have aflerted the justice ard

as to produce your arguments to demon

tempt a reply. You have every encour

your a ntagonil s abilities are no ways

1 lie afpi.it here prtlented by a compa
-1 lon of the f. ve a! documents \Vns lir.gu
lar and remark ible, I hi; fubotdinate of
jeer appeared in direst opjM/fition to the
chief n.agiftrate. The agent was seen o
verrtding by his own orders, the orders ol
bis principal. The language of the Pre
fident wasâ!'y virtue of the power veil
ed in me by law, I d- (line the mon y tc
be borrowed to the discharge of the inttal
merits and intcrefl of the foteign dtbt.â
The language of the Secretary wasâ]
deflinc a pari of the monev oniy to th it
purpose, and a psrt to be brought to the
U. S. for other pnrpofes. He left every
member to make his own reft cfi ions oi
thia view of the fubjeft. He would on!)
ob( rve in general, that it demor, lira ted till
truth . fferud in the proportion, that the
.Secretary bud violate â¢ both the law o
August /t, and the inftru&ions o
the Prtfident relating to it.
He then proceeded to a more diftinfi
view of the two points particularly liatec
ill the resolution.
'I he firll was "that a ce:tain portior
of Ihe principal borrowed under the ail
of August 4th, 1790, bad been applied cc
the p yrnent of the interest falling due or
that principal." As the fact would lit t
be preluined, be denied, he forebore ti
quote that part of the documents whicl
admitted aud authenticated it. He won't
however premi e, to any observations or
it, a cursory view cf the nature of appro
pi iations.
It was unncceffaiy to repeat the em
plistic remarks on thi fubj ft which bar
fallen f nm the mem'ier from Pennfylva
nia ("-Ir. lindley.) It was fufficieutly
undeftood, he concluded, tint appropria
lions of money were of .1 hijjh and sacred
character ; that they were the great bid
wark \vh ch our constitution had careful y
and j'raloufly eftablilhed againll executive
uirpationi. lie meant onl t:> take no
ti.eof the different pl.ms into which ap
j.roprialioiu might be moulded and q!
the particular operation which ought to be
given to them.
One of the plans was that of appro
priating fpecified funds to Ipccifir 1 ob
lefts, i i which the supposed certainty ol
the funds w.s adjlifted to the supposed
iiliportance of the object
'i'he o her plan formed all the bran
ch.':; of icvenue into an aggregate fund,
on which the several objects (hould have a
| riot ity of claim, accordirg to their su
periority of importance.
It was evident, that in both these ca
fes, the legiflaturc alone possessed the
competent authority. The exc ufive right
i f that department of t e government
to ni ke the proper regulations, was the
bails ol the utility and effieaiy of appro
priations.
There was a third qucftion incident to
the dcitrine of appropriation , viz whe
ther, under fpecilic ppropriationi, such
as had been adopted by Cougrefs, the ex
e utive authority could, without f >ecial
p r.niffion of the law, apply the excess of
one fund'to the aid of a deficient one ;or
borrow from one fund for the object of an
o'her. On this question there initilit per
haps be a difference of opinion. He would
only remark, that admitting such a discre
tion to be implied in the tfuft of executing
the ans it would flillbe requili'e that the
due fanftaon of the executive fliould be
given, that a regular account fhoul.l be
kep: between the different funds, and that
all advances from one to the other, fliould
be re:i!.:ccd as foc.n .is poflil.le. I his vva-.
equally necessary to the prefcrvation of or
der in the public si ianceÂ», and to a proper
refpedt for the authority of the laws
In Ihe present cafe it did riot appear
that the monies taken at different tune
from th< loans defignaied by the Prefideiil,
and thereby placed u der the appropr a
tion of the ast of August 4th, , 790, to tin
foreign had ever been replaced. Ii
did not appear that any such lepiacemvnt
was regularly planned or provided fur â
It was particular y worthy of obfeivation,
moreover, that the only use within tin
United States for which any loan in En
10 ie c< nld be afligned, was that of th'
linking fund ; that the trullees of this sunn
had never been even informed of the
that if all the nonius drawn !;nd been cur
to the finking fund, the limited sum
of i,OCO,COO of dollars would have tbeeu
exceeded; and that the fta'tments and ac
counts lisd in fait I.â¢â en fÂ» w.ii :<j t'p, a
mentioned by tl e secretary, that not a
lingle dollar of the money laid out in pur
chafiug the public debt, had been charged
on loam drawn into the United Stales ;
a'tho' such wr.s the only purpose to which
they were lega'ly applies! 1., and f:ich thi
principal reason assigned for making the
drafts
He did not go into a particular proof
that the sum drawn into the United States,
after fubtradting the whole sum placed to
a fore gn account, exceeded the sum ot
2,000.c00 ofdollais, because the fadt had
been conceded on the oth.r fide particu
larly by the llatement of t' e member from
Connecticut, (Mr. Hillhoufe.)
hus it p: eared clearly, in confiÂ»ma
tion ot the fir 11 point, that the application
of a certain portion of the principal bor
rowed in Europe, t> the payment of the
interest was not a mere tianfpofition of
moni s, to prevent the fending them back
wards or farwaids. Ncr an advance of mo
ney from one overflowing fund in favor of
a deficient one, but an absolute diversion
of appropriated money ; a d conlequt ntly
a violation of the law making the appro
priation.
The second point in the resolution r< la
ted to the drawing of monies into the Uni
ted States without the inftrudtion of the
President.
This point bad been fully efiablifhed by
the documents and explanations a plied to
'hefirfl. They had done more: ey
ad demi nftrated that the inltrudtiona of
the Prefident,which dedicated the loans, to
be made under hiscommifli mi, o a foreign
object, were an express prohibiti no dratÂ»
f r any domestic object, It was f fiicient
herefore to n fer to the inflrudt ons of the
President, and to the contradictory (leps
t&ken by the Secretary.
Two attempts have been made to elude
the force of hefe official proofs
Ihe firll app aled to the President's
Tpeech at the opening of the session in
1790 ; to the report ol the Secretary made
n consequence of it to the H< life ; and to
he supplementary ast ofCongreft pafTetl in
ionformity to the r port.
I :a.l the circumflances involved in thi
ranfedtion been attended to by those wo
eemed to rely on it, Mr. Madison w .â¢
jerfuaded that a reference to it would ne.
rer have been made by gmtlem n on th :t
ide. As they had thought fit, however,
o draw arguments from that fourcv, it w s
iroper to give an answer to them : and
he be it answer would be a naked (latent nt
)f fadts
The infirudtions of the President to the
Secretary were given, as has been seen, on
he 28th of August 1790. The letter <if
he Secretary contravening this inftrudtion,
rvas dated, as has also been seen, on the
ame 2lith day ofAuguft, 1 790.
I'he adtual drawing of hi Is by the Se
â retarv commenced on the ijtu of De
.ember 1790.
The law now pleaded in jollification of
he conduct of the Secretary pasTed on the
jd of March 179 1.
There are titer f'dts material to a cor
edt and full view of the hulinefs.
I he speech of the Prefi I nt was deliver
don the Bth of D cember 1790. It
>riefly informed the House that " a loan
>fth ee millions of fl lins, towards which
ome proviiional meaftires had previotifly
aken place, had been completed in Hoi
and," and 'â¢ that the Secretary of the
frcafury hail his diredtlon to communicate
uch further part iculars as might be re
juilite for more precise information "
The consequent report of the Secretary
â ecommending the provilion in the supple
â¢nentary adt, was not received till the 25th
jf February 1 79 t, fix days only before the
:onllitutional diflblution of the House,
In the interval between the speech of
the President and the Secretary's report,
lie had proceeded to draw bills to tile a
mount of 793,392 florins.
His report, nt witliftan ling what has
been fa'd of it, contained not a word fr. m
which it could be known th t a single (1 >-
rn had bee 1 adtually drawn over to the
United .'â¢tales.
The other attempt to elude the evidence
before the committee recoiled w-th equal
force on the gentlemen who had hazarded
it. In the report lately made by the lYii!-
lees of the finking fund, i a (latenicnt laid
before th.m by the Secretary, in which i; j
'* noted, "11.r.t the acceptance of the'oaii
of three n.ilJions of florins, and the app ica
tion of one third of if to the purpose of
that fund w s under the consideration of
lie Prelident."
Fio'n this fact it had been inferred, not
only t'.iat the Secretary had withheld no
proper information frum the trustees, bat
ihat the result of t!ie Prelident's delibcra
lions on the fubjeft had varied the purpose
fignified by his firll inflruftions to the Se
cretary.
k happened, however, mod unfortu
nately for the gentlemen who exulted in
thin argument, that they had entirely o
veilooked the dates of the two papers
The paper l iid before the trustees and al
ledgcd to liave explained the final pur,iofc
of the President, was dated on the ij h ol
Augull 1790. The paper relied on bv
the other tide, as the final, as well as the
moll forma) designation of the will of tht
President, was dated the 28th of Augull
179 a. The gentlemen, therefore, inllead
ot the inference they hadmade, fh.valJ
hsve reversed their premises, and joined
with their opponents in concluding thai
tin President was led, by a consideration ol
the fuljeft, not to do what the Secretar
in his rote to the truilecs, fee:red to anti
cipate, but what had been evinced by the
Prcfidrnt's own ast of pollerior date.
he second point, then, as will as the
fi;(l, refls 011 the moll solid proofs tak.r:
from a collective view of authentic docu
mcuts.
Much has been said on the nectfTiy o
I mctimes depar ing from the ftriftnefs ol
leg I appropi ia ions, as a p!. a for any free
dorm that may have been tak n with them
bv the Sen tary. He would not deny
that there might be emergencies 11 tht
course of hnman affair , of lo extraordina
ry and p effing a nature, as to a solve (I<Â«
txe utive fr m an inflÂ»xible Conformity tc
the injunctions of the law It was, never
thclifs, as eflVntial to rememl er, as it wai
obvious to remark, that in all such cases,
thenccifii'y should be palp.bit ; that Ihe
execut ve fanftion (hould flow from the
fnpreme foutce, and tlut the firll oppor
tunity should be foized for communicating
to the legifl.itlire the meafares pursued.
wth the re Tons explaining the neceflily
of them. Th s early communication Â»-ai
equ il v enforce ! by pi udence ami by duty.
It was the liefl evidence of the motives foi
affu ning the xt'aordinary power ; i' wai
arefpect manif-llly due to the legiflatm
authority ; and it was more particularly
in 'ifpei.fible, as that alone would enablt
the legislature, by a provident amendment
ol the law, to acconwiodaie it lo like e
mergencies in future.
In the proceedings f.dli g under tht
pref nt enquiry, no neei Iliry appeared sot
he liberties which had been taken, th.
money appropr ated in Europe being inort
wanted there than ;t home. It appeared
that the inilruftions of the supreme exe
cutive, inllead of warranting tliofe liber
'its, had precluded them. Nor had tht
prope explanations been disclosed in dut
time to the legillature.
To phrc the fubjeft in a more dilinft
poiiit of view, it was proper to advert tc
lie preeife authorities and duties oÂ» the
Secretary as his ollice ia defined by the
ast ellablilhing a treasury department.â
For this purpose Mr. M. read the second
feftion of that ast, wh eh is in the woidi
followingâ" That it (hall he the duty ol
the eeretary of the Treasury to digell or
prepare plans for the improvement and
management of the revenue, and for Ihe
fuppo t of public credit ; to prepare and
report estimates of the public revenue and
the public expenditures ; to superintend
the revenue ; to decide on the forms of
keepi g and lining accounts, an I making
returns, and to grant under the limitat ons
herein ellablilhtd, or to be hereafter pro
vided, all warrants for moil es to be issued
from the treasury, in pursuance of appro,
priations by law ; to execute luch fe viccs
relative to the sale of the lands belonging
