Parliamentary Reform.
IN the year 1782, Mr. Pitt moved for a
committee" to inquire into the pre
sent (late of the representation in parlia
ment, and to report to the house tlieir ob
serrations thereon." In support of this
amongst other argument?, to
prove the corrupted state of the reprcfen
tation, in describing the iituation of the
different boroughs in the kingdom, he
fii-J " the vstcrtjlt of the treasury are confid
treil, as wed as the interejls of the great man,
the Iqrd, or the commoner, who has connexion
until the borough; but the intcrefts of the
people, the rights of the ele&ors, are the
only things that are never attended to, 01
taken into the account." As 1 (til! (Irong
cr illullration of his argument he farthei
said, " there are cities and boroughs more
within thejurifdiciion of the Carnatic t. .in the
limits of the empire oj Great-Britain ; and it
is a fail pretty well knoiun, and generally un â 
(ferJlood,that the nabob of Arcot has no
less than seven or eight members in this
house." Towards iheclofeof his speech
he cited the opinion of lord Chathamâ
" That person," he said, " was not apt to
indulge vague and chimerical speculations, in
conjijlent with praHice and expediency. I
personally know that it was the opinion of
that person, that without recurring to Jirfl
principles in this refpeel, and e/lablfhing a
more solid and equal representation of the peo â 
pie, by which the proper ccnflilutiona! ctnnex â 
ion miyht be revised, this nation, with the
belt capacities for grandeur and happiness
of any on the face of the earth, mull be
confounded with the mass of those whose
liberties are loft in the general corruption
of the people."
It was in this manner that Mr- Pitt
spoke in the year 1782, when he Was an
advocate for a reform of parliament.
He was answered by Mr. T. Pitt,
{now lord Camelford) who fdid, â" I dis
approve of the proposition, beccufe it leads to a
pr inciple / never can admit of âa principle oj
equal representation. I dif approve of the
mode, lecaufe I confulcr a committee of the
fort proposed by my honorable friend, con â 
fining itfelf to 110 fpecific proportion,
nay, to no line or princ pie whatever, as
tending to no purpose but to hold out vi
fionary hopes to visionary men, which it ;j
utterly impojjible to fatisfy, ar.d which, ending
in dijappointment to the expellati.nof the pub
lie, can produce no confequ nee, but to in
flemethe pafiions, and difTeminate difson
tent over the kingdom. Now, Sir, aj ti
the moment, allow me to fay, that it appcan
to be ill chosen on many acctunts. There ar<
at this time, wild and extravagant ideas in
the public with regard to the representa
tion, which I hope time and reflection will
cxpofe in their true light ; but till that spi
rit (hall have fublided, it is little likely
that anyfober, pradlical, judicious fchemc
of regulation in this particular can be at
tended with the conlequences we might
wifh."âln the conclusion of his speech hs
addsâ" Gentlemen may flatter tlnm
lielves they can set bounds to these enqui
ries as they please, and be mailers of tlx
torrent they are going to let in upon us
that when they admit the principle of equal re
presentation, which they feel to be impraSica
ble in its full force, they can rejlrain its opera
tion to the degree they fnall think proper,
They are miflaken ; the principle nni/l be car
ried through, or it mujl be abandoned."
Such are the common-place topics with
which th<-fe interested in viewing the pre
sent corrupt system have at all times com
bated proposals for reform. Such were
the arguments opposed to Mr. Pitt in
1782 ; such, in the year 1792, are the
very arguments he himfelf uses since his
opinions are changed, and he is become a
determined oppofcr ot a reform of parlia
ment. To this purpose the following
ftanzae are pertinent, supposed to be spo
ken by Mr. Pitt:

WEDNESDAY, July 25, 1792.
THE gentlemen fay,
They remember tli? day,
When I was an advocate warm ;
For equalization
Oi repi'efentation,
And aloud for reform.
But indeed t'would be (trange,
If my mind did not change,
As circumltnnce alters the cafe;
Thcfc (hort lightfed-fnen,
M;iy remember when
Another man was in my place.
Majorities did
What the ministers bid ?
And he was the nation's undoing ;
I was thin as a Hag,
And my empty green bag
Presented lio picture but ruin.
No borough then rotten
By me was forgotten,
I brought them al! into disgrace ;
But their timbers were found
To be pcrfeÂ£Uy found,
The moment I go: into place.
I admit there are blots,
And a few little spots,
Whiehftainthe white robe c>f the nation ;
But that is no cause
For mending bad laws,
And changing the representation.
At some other season
It might be a reason,
Though at present it is not the cafe ;
I am minilter prime,
And 'twill never be time,
So long as I keep in my place.
That the French (hould be beaten in
jn engagement with superior numbeis of
Jifcip'ined t'oops is not to be wondered
it. They mult expect to be beaten in e
m-y action for months to come. With
nothing to oppose to cool (kill, and drift
obedience, but tumultuous mthufiafm and
irregular impctuofity, they can expedt on
y to seize on triumph by a couple main.
A regular adtion mult be fatal to them.
Dut we have seen that men are belt school
ed by adverlity. They will be disciplin
ed by their enemies; and a whole nation,
si hting for liberty, can afford the loss o(
men that they mult fuffer in training.
The defeat therefore would not have
mrt the caufc of freedom ; but if it be
rue that a savage multitude wrelted from
he tribunal of justice their own officers,
jnd murdered them with horrible cruelties,
the cause is indeed wounded in its vitals.
It is almost as difgracefhl as the riots of
Birmingham were to England ; with this
only difference in favour of the French
ruffians, that their passions were inflamed
b/ a sudden (hock of misfortune, whereas
the Euglifh banditti had no provocation ;
loctle to their atrocity but black and fu
rious ignorance worked upon by prieft
:raft and bigotry.
We remain itill, however, so uninform
:d on the fubjedt, that we ought to sus
pend our judgments until we have more au
thentic particulars.
Miuilters though sometimes competed
to acknowledge rhe existence of abuse, al
ways oppqfe the application of a remedy,
T hey are sensible that a reform of things
would naturally lead to a change of men.
THE TUDLIC EDUCATION OF FRANCE.
IN the plan of public education, sub
mittid to the National Assembly by M.
Cordorcet, and which is printed ft) 1 * tile
use of the members, there is the following
memorable pallage :
" The principles of morality taught in
the fchocls. and in the iniliiutions, (hall
be thole which, founded on natural senti
ment and reason, belong equally to all
men. The conltitution in recognizing
the right which each individual has 10
chufe his religious wordiip, and in tllab
lifningan entire equality among all the in
habitants of France, doc.s not permit that
any mode of religious worihip (hall, be a-
dopted, which excluding the children of
one part of the citizens, would destroy the
equality of advantages, or would give to
particular dogmas aa advantage contrary
to the freedom of opinions. It is there
fore r igorouily necelTary to separate from
morality the principles of all particular
religions, and not to admit into public in
ltruÂ£tion, the teaching of any mode of re
ligious worlhip. Every one of thefeought
to be tajiglit in the temples by its proper
ninilterj Tlie parents, whatever may be
ilieir cieed, whatever may be their opini
in, as to the neceflity of fueh or such re
igion, can then, without repugnance.fend
heir children to the national ellablifh
â nents, and the Hate will not, as heretofore,
ifurp the rights of conscience, under ihe
jrctext of cnligiitening and direftiufl
hem."
Extract of a Idler from Paris, April Zs.
" A robber and afTaffin was this day ihe
irft to experience the fatal effeÂ£t of the
aew machine for the execution of crimin
lis. lie was securely bound to an up
- ght pillar, which turning upon a hinge
aid him in a horizontal position with his
lead in a kind of aperture like that of a
pillory. The boards that confined his
liead were doub'e to adm t between them
:i blade of enormous weight, which rufliing
down upon an inclined plane, divided the
neck with certau and inllantaneous effect,
and no doubt without much sensation ,of
pain to the fufterer. A basket placed be
fore him received the head ; the bleeding
trunk was again erected, and both were
immediately sent away. Though there is
fomethir.g awful in this punishment, the
populace, who coolly difcufled its merits,
aid " they fnould relish it better than
aanging." The honor of the invention
x'ing due to M. Guillotin, phyGcian, po
itical writer, and a diftinguifted member
}f the Grit assembly, it is universally Galled
he Guillotine. Could his modesty, how
;ver, have forefeeu that he fliou'd go by
:his road to immortality, it is much to be
ioubted whether he would have availed
iimfelf of the versatility of his talents."

Extrall of a leit:r from IVarfiw, Vlpr'il 25.
" Our political horizon becomes more
and more dark, and the machinations of
our enemies at the courtcfPeteifburg have
given us an uneasiness, by no means ill.
founded. The information wchavereceived
from our miniiler at Vienna, and the Em
press's declaration to that court, fully con
firm ouiapprchenlions. At a meeting of
the Diet pu the 2lit inft. the king com
municated the dispatches he had received
from our trrinifter at the court of Russia,
which have changed our doubts into a difa
greeablecertainty. Our mmifter writesfiom
thence, that Counts Potocki, Brewulki,
and some other of our principal opponenta
and mal-contents have fully succeeded in
their attempts to engage the court of Pe
cerlburg to arm againlt ouf new conltilu
tion. The courts of Vienna and Berlin
have endeavored to negociate in our favor,
though ineffectually ; the reply of the
Empress was, that (lie was determined ri
gidly to adhere to the guarantee /he had
formerly given to the old form of govern
ment eitablifhed under the auspices of Po
laNd. The leafon for warlike operations
being now at hand, every thing pioves that
the French revolution will accelerate the
holiilities of Russia."
Manhe'tm, May 2 The greater part of
the Hates of the empire are very mucli
disinclined to wir. The ecclefiatlical
princes, who have nothing to lofe,and give
theinfelves little trouble about the general
prosperity of the country, feeia alone to
Jefire it.
Berlin, .April 28. Four days are now
elapsed since the troops, dedincd againlt
France, were assembled. The reginunrj
to march are as follow ; Waldeck, Bn-s

Schoenfield, Ivarnitz, Kleilt, Hohenlohe,
Willinghoven, Wolframdorf, Her{zberg,
Borch, Renouard, Legat, Ernft-Mufllfng,

batteries of great guns, three batteries of
field artillery, besides what belongs to each
regiment. It may be depended 011 that
the King will head the army in person,
and the Prince Royal will accompany him.
St. Peterjburg, April 20. Armies are
rafingand fleets equipping, which wiil aÂ£t,
it is said, according to circumltances,
either againlt Poland or France, or both.
In cafe of invading the latter, a Swedish
fleet is to join the Ruffian, in order to
convince the French patriots, that the al
liance, or concert of powers is not a plan
tom. The French have been doing all in
their power to engage Denmark to fide
with them, but their elfort9 were ftuitlefs.
It is now well known that the court
of Copenhagen i 3 too prudent to inter,
meddle iuthe concerns ofother nations and
neglect their own, Discontented refugee*
from Poland are daily coming in here*
They do not appear much in public, and
with good reason, for notwithstanding we
Ruffians are called fiaves, we view with in
effable contempt these traitors to their
country, who come to alk our affulaocc
againlt the liberties of their nation.
Our court has at length had intelligence
of captain Billings, who is employed in
continuing to make discoveries for Russia
in the South Seas. This navigator du
ring the year 1790, surveyed those duf
fers of islands denominated the Kourllit
and Aloutes, where he has discovered
many new species of plants, proper fortho
fultenance of man and bealt: happy disco
veries ! and a thousand times more ufeful
to man than those political fyltems which
diftuib, and will for a long time dillurb
the peace of this little reltlefs quarter of
the globe, called Europe." Tlic river Neva broke t:p ont!is I2t?i t'n-
Hant having been fail frozen e .xr Once the
6th of December. Indeed, ail our purs
a e now open ; and 'twece to be widicd,
for lbe happiness of Rullia, that only com
mercial movements would take place the
ensuing season : peace is much wanting to
repair the mifchiefs conltantly attendant
upon war.
Gener a, May I. "We learn from
Turin, that the court has ordered four of
the newly taifed regiments to march into
Savoy, amongst which is that of the
guards The militia are to be aflembled
on the fourth ; so that the Duchy will
have 10,000 men to defend it in cafe ol
an attack from France. All this military
parade, however, does not alarm the inha
bitants ; and an uneasiness exists in the
towns, particularly, which may becomc
fatal to the authority of the king of Sar
dinia. As to Switzerland, the canton oi
Zurick is for the most absolute neutrality-
At Milan it is reported that the king oi
Naples is advancing with ten thoufanc
men towards Nice. Whoever reads Mr
Salis' travels through Naples and Sicily,
will be convinced that the king in endea
vouring to help ext!ngui!h the flame it
Trance, will set fire to his own nest.
Paris, May 2t. The Aulbrian mani
fejlo published by the Governors-General o
the Low Countries, excites more and mori
indignation, as the despotic principles of i
are more and more investigated. It i
probable that if Leopold had been living
it would have been better adapted to aftua
circumstances In quality of despot hi
might have said a great deal'againil liberty
and the mifebiefs that attend it ; he migh'
have greatly exaggerated the momentan
difordsrs which it bringswiih it in a court
try that pasTes suddenly from one extremi
of government to the contrary extreme
He might have stigmatized the Frencl
nation, the immense majority of that na
tion, legally represented, as a band off/c
tious wretches, or even a club of Jaco
bins. He might have dwelt upon th.
excellencies and bleflings of nobility an<
aristocracy till he was tired, as the mairi
feftos do; but he would not have been si
much off his guard as to have mqntionec
the obligations, which, in various refpefts
the French nation lies under to thefeclafTe
of citizens. He would not have dared t(
recal to the minds of Frenchmen tha;
their obligations to the nobility confiftet
only in the melancholy recollection tha
they had been opprefTed by them for man;
centuries, without rights civil or political
groaning under the weight of feudal ant
sacerdotal slavery, without remedy or com
passion. Leopold would have been cau
tious how he mentioned monks, priests
and their confifckted property. He woulc
have been afraid to recal to the memorj
of the Belgians the conduct of Mari;
Theresa in this refpeft, and especially thai
of joseph the I Id, who banished the priefb
and monks from their churches,and expel
led them from their convents, and pofTeffec
himfelf of their property, afterwards con
fcrring pensions upon them much less con
siderable than those allowed to the Frcncl
priests by the National ArTembly. Thi:
seizure of the church-property by Joseph,
was under pretence of establishing a religi
ous fund, that is to fay, putting it into hii
own purseâ-We mull, however,do the ma
nifefto justice in one particular. It is 1
proof, of itfelf, that the age of philofophj
is rapidly advancing, when tyrants find
themselves under the necefiity of aidrefT
ing their arguments to the reason of man
kind. In th s instance they either reason.
or pretend to reason. Only listen to one
of the arguments which they make use oi
to fortify the Brabantines againfl the de
luiions of French liberty. The French
ast (fay they) " under the deceitful colour
of an equality of chimerical rights, not ex.
ilting in fact, and annihilated if it could
for a moment exist, by that variety of cha
racter, imposed on all mankind at their
birth, by which they share in very unequal
proportions, moral faculties, the dispro
portion of which has always determined,
and will ever determine the ascendancy oi
genius, strength, patience," &c. &c.âWe
grant that there is a natural and necefTary
inequality in mankind, which, in a state of
nature can produce nothing but injustice
and violence, the conquering of which
malignant propensities is the business of
every civilized society. But the philoso
pher who composed the manifefto, infers
from the nature of man in a savage state,
that this natural, this precious inequality,
null be supported and maintained in so
ciety : The prerogatives of tyrants are ad
mirably adapted to (his purpose, as weil as
the emoluments and cnciufive honors af
i.by inferior orders ; not to mention
other good tiFcdts which are produced by
the preponderance of the " better fort"
i:i the vari ius ranks of society. Such is
the reasoning addreffedto the people of the
Brabantine provinces !â'lt may be proper
to add that the mercenaries from Hunga
ry have orders to kill the citizens and
peasantry of the Brabantine piovinces,
witness a second manifefto publiflied by
general Bender, from which it appears
that the sword and bayonet are cloathed
with judiciary power in the Low Countries
during the whole campaign, and that hos
tile measures are to be adopted against all
ill designing persons, whether in cities,
towns, or villages.
Proclamation and Information from the

HAVING been compelled to aflembk
an army againlt an enemy which has pre
sumed to declare war, in a manner the
molt unjuftifiable, against his ApoÃolica
Majesty Francis the 111, King of Hunga
ry, and it being apparent that in conse
quence thereof many fortreffes and pods
are diverted of their garrisons, it is expert
ed that in this situation of affairs, all citi

well as public order and tranquility, noi
only out of regard to their own private in

If excesses of the kind above mention'

Basil, (Switzerland) May 3. The arif

of talifmanic effect, and entirely fafcinate
the eyes as well as the underllanding.
They contrive a creed of the French pol t

set about abusing it as if it was the rea
constitution. But what do they hope tc

with which France has declared war again(t

prodused an allonilhing effect in Switzer

WE call God and all nations to wit 11 ell

annihilate the julf influence and authority,
which being derived immediately from

Animated by these salutary and whole-

concurrence of one of the three estates ol
that kingdom) that propofesto extend th:
chimerical liberty, to which some of the
white nations insolently aspire, even to the
blacks of Alrica. A measure so pregnant
with danger to the ancient order of things,
and which in its consequences would
eilablilh the romantic and diabolical notion
oi equality among men, their majesties,
with the blefling of divine providence, mull
withstand and repress. They have there

r T^ H " constitution of the United States
A begins, we the people. The ad
vocates of the system have plumed them
lelves on having, made a notable discovery
in governmentâthat the lovereign power
of tree states rests with the people*-and yet '
these very men appear jealous and condemn
with the most insolent abuse every attempt
made by the people to inquire into the mea
sures of government. If it was even con
lirtent with the principles of the general
government to suppress t'he opinions of the
citizens respecting public affairs, would it
be fafe ? would the legislature ast with
greater circumfpeaion, justice and wisdom,
enveloped in the dead silence of a despotic
government, than having its measures con
stantly canvafled by free citizens, who are
to be afiefted by its measures ; legislatures
must either have designs inimical to the lib
erties of the people, or must be puny politi
cians indeed, who wifli to make every act
of government amyftery of state.
In civil society force is not to be used e
ven against unjust laws, except as the ultima
ratiopopuli. What then must we think of
those men who wish to suppress eyerv kind
of candid investigation respecting public af
fairs, or who thro' the medium of a venal
press give them a falfe coloring, only in
tended to deceive ? there is no (late of in
difference with refpeft to public measures ;
they are either calculated to promote the
private interests of the well-born few, or to
secure the prosperity and happiness of the
people. The choice between the two is
certainly a matter of importance. But in
what manner is the choice to be made if a
candid investigation into public measures is
to be suppressed ? A government that sin
cerely desires to do good will encourage a
free and public inquiry on every fubjeft, in
order to come at the truth. The melan
choly silence which prevails in Turkey,
Ruiiia, and other despotic governments,
neither proves the security of those em
pires, nor the happiness and contented situ
ation ofthe people. It is true that you
hear no complaint of the ministry, no dil'-
refpectful word uttered refpefting the af
fairs of government, and yet the oppressed.
fubjefts are frequently roused from the
most timid state of fubmiflion, to afls of tha
utmost outrage and violence. You may*
for a time retain men in the most abject
state ofoppreffion, and you may dignify it
with the name of government,but it has ra
ther the appearance of a secret ming which,
however apparently quiet, yet is every 1110- â¢
ment in danger of explosion.

Detached Thoughts on Elective
Govern'ment.
SUPPOSE the United States were, like
Poland, surrounded onalllidesby jealous,
ambitious, powerful neighbours, what in
:ereft could any of these have in embroil
ing the country by their intrigues, to pro
cure the election of any one particular per
on ? they could not place a ftrangerin the
Pi elident s chair : for though at present a
foreigner may ftiil beelefted, that foreign--
?r must be a resident citizen, of 14 years'
landing ; and after the lapse of a few
rears, none but " a natural born citizen" will
Je eligible. Behdes, how could they, in
-eturn for their millions spent in bribery
ind coi ruption, ever hope to derive equi
valent advantages from a man, who is elect
ed, not for life, as was the cafe in Poland, but â¢
.01 the short term offour years, and who is
noreover liable at ali times to be impeach
ed arid removed from office for the fmallelt
instance of mal-adminiftration ?
Had Charles 11. of England expected to
be caded to account for hiscondutt, would
he ever have ventured to betray the inter -
efts of Britain, by felling Dunkirk to the
: 1 rench, for less than the value of the very
stores and ammunition contained in its ma
gazines at the time of its firrrender ? had
George 111. been liable to impeachment,
would he have dared, in opposition to the
wiflies of a majority of his lubjefts, to in
volve Britain and America in all the hor
rors of a civil war?-No: neither ofthenV
would have been so fooLhardy. But the
misfortune is, that kings, who are vested
with sovereign power for 999 years if they
happen to live so long, area fort of poldicol
At/ieijts, who, not expecting an
ox 1 etribution, think themselves entitled to
aa 4* they gleafe, especially as it is wellknown, that " kings can do no torot>g n â
Whereas the man, who if entrusted vvitl
power only for a. Short time, and win
knows that he is Habit to do wrong, rouil
firmly believe in a future (late, where hi
will be rewarded with praise or impeach
ment, according to his deeds : and by fuel
belief, he will regulate his conduct.
When the candid, honed American con
templates the enormous abuses, that have
invariably attended hereditary power ir
every country of the world : when he re
flects, that all the evils, attendant on tin
election of a chief magistrate, are obviatec
by our happy constitution, whilst all the be
nefits are secured to us ; he cannot but ac
knowledge, that our form oi" government
is infinitely superior to any that has evei
yet been eftablilhed in the known world.
It mnft therefore be his ardent wish tc
guard it agaialt all encroachments or inno
vations ; and he ought to be cautious how
lie gives ear to the doctrines of any man
who recommends alterations in ir, excepl
for the fple purpose of erecting, if poiiible.

CHARLESTON, July 5.
Yesterday being the anniversary of the
Independence of America, the fame wasob
fdrvecl with the usual demonflrations oJ
joy. The day commenced with a discharge
of cannon from the incorporated battalior
of artillery, and a peal from the bells of St.
Michael's church. About five A. M. the
different uniform corps and militia parad
ed to the State House, from whence a de
tachment of the Charleston cadets marcher
to Mrs. Jamefon's, where they' were pre
sented with an elegant Stand of colours,
finifhed by the young ladies of that Semina
ry,, upon which occaSion, lieutenant Mitch
ell, delivered a short, but well adapted ad
dress. The Poreftevs, at the fame time re
ceived a like favor from the young ladies
at Mrs. Colco';k'sâFrom the parade thdj
marched a short wav from town, where
they were reviewed by the hon. General
Pinckney, Moultrie, Read, See. The uni
form corps furpafTed the mod Sanguine ex
pectations. About eleven, the Cincinnati
marched to church, where an oration was
delivered, Suitable to the occasion, by
Charles Lining, Esq. one of the members.
A nlunber of companies dined together,
and the day concluded with that hilarity
and regularity for which the citizens ol
Charleston have ever been remarked.
NEW-YORK, July 20.
Yesterday arrived in this city, his Excel
lency Mr. Hammond, the Britifn AmbafTa
dor, from Philadelphia.
A letter from England fays, " The affaf
fniation of the king of Sweden has struck
an alarm into several European Sovereigns,
almost incredible 5 and the sportive Spirit
of the times Seems difpoled to jest a - good
deal with royal credulity. The EmpreSs
of all the Ruffias has Shut herfelf up in the
interior of her palaceâthe king of Pruflia
has been nearly mad in consequence of a
Roflecrufian vision. The Stacltholder of
Holland is opposed by his own son, and re
ceives daily letters not to appear at such
and such places, if he values his life ; and
even our own dear king, whom God long
preserve \Cith all his faults, has received a
letter warning him not to go to the Totten
ham-street concert,for there were Jacobins even
in England."
That France will maintain its consti
tution we have not a doubt. The nation
mult be annihilated before kings can ex
tinguish the Sacred flame. They cannot
make them unlearn their knowledge. The
Frenchmay be beaten for want of disci
pline; they may be made rafli and intem
perate by malignant Suggestions ; they may
be driven to the last ditch by force or treach
ery, but the lalt man of twenty-four milli
ons, who has tasted of the cup of liberty,
will not return to his ancient potion."
Yesterday upwards ot two hundred
friends to liberty in this city, gave an ele
gant entertainment at the city tavern, to
the hon. John Jay, chief justice of the
k United State;-, at which several gentiemen,
as well from the city as the country, who
â¢were particularly inviteN, were all pre
sent.
It was thefeaft of freedom and friend
shipâ-each eye sparkled with pleasure, in
beholding the diltinguifhed patriot, whom a
free people had lately honored with their
Suffragesâwhile an honest indignation rose
in every bosom, when the thought occur
red, of the vile attempt to rob him of that
honor to which those fufFrages entitled
him.
A band of music played at intervals dur
ing the entertainment, and the following
toasts were drank under a discharge of can
jiou, accompanied by the shouts and huz
zas of the people.
[Here follow 15 /00/Zs. ]
Mr. Jay then gave the following toast.
May the people always refpeft them
selves, and remember what they owe to
folterity.
Mr. Jay then retired, faying, gentlemen,

He was escorted to hi.-, houle by a com

After Mr. Jay had retired the company
drank.

When the committee returned,tlje whole
company broke up, and went in pioceflion
to Mr. Jay's houSe ; and after giving him
three cheers, they diiperfed.
PHILADELPHIA.
JULY 25, 1792.
The latest advices received from France
are by the way of Boston. These slate thai
Ihe armies of France had not come to any
engagement (incethe repulse from Tournay
and Mons; the failure of which had pre
vented M. de la Fayette's army from com
mencing its operations. His army (Sa>
these accounts) is under the bell discipline,
and they request those who have aflaffinat
ed General Dillon, may be brought to pu
nifliment. Part of three regiments of ca
valry have deserted. They put great con
fidence in the national guards, and each
corps arc burning with delij-e to diftinguift
thenifelves. They fay that Ofrend is to be
garrisoned by Dutch troops, and An vers b)
Prussian, and that the king of Prussia hat
declared himfelf against the French nation,
and had lent into Auftriau Flanders 42,00 c
men, and had set oft'for Colbert. Private
periods had demanded permillion to lit out
privateers from Oftend, which was refufec
them by which it appears that the merchanl
(hips would not be interrupted by either
party ; in consequence the premium of in
surance in France and in England was the
fame as before the war.
" The canvaflers of the vetes for govern
or (fays a letter from New-York) have
kindled a flame which will not be soon ex
tinguiflied. The people are forming com
mittees in every county, and mean to pe
tition the legillature for redress."
Advices from Cape Francois, and other
parts of French HiSpaiiiola, to the beginning
of July, are as unfavorable as ever. A Spi
rit of discord seems to have taken pofleflioi
of all descriptions of people, which threa
tens, we may fay has nearly ensured the
total ruin of the colony. The people of
Port-au-Prince, Cape Nichola Mole, and
Port Jeremie, have refufed to accept the
decree of the National Alfembly, granting
certain privileges to the mulattoes and free
negroes. At Port-au-Prince, they fitted
out five cruisers, to prevent Supplies from
being carried into any of the out-ports ;
they likewise feut a twenty gun ship, and
four Smaller veflels, armed, to the Mole, to
bring down a general to command them.
He accordingly embarked with 300 volun
teers, joo stand of arms, and- every thing in
proportion. On his way down he was ta
ken by a 74 gun ship, and carried into St.
Marc, with one of the (loops ; the other
three escaped. The day after, the gover
nor of Hifpaniola arrived from the Cape,
with another 74 gun ship ai;d a frigate,
when the captive-general, Borel, was or
dered into close confinement, and all his
men. The governor then received on board
400 volunteers of St. Marc, and on the 22c!
inflant, failed for Port-au-Prinee, with the
two 74 gun (hips, a frigate, and a 20 gun
fliip ; at the fame time 2000 mulattoes
marched down upon the back of Port-au-
Prince, with the French Commillioner,
who had arrived from France, a white
general, and a commander in chief of the
mulattoes, in order to enforce the decree.
On the 24th, in the afternoon, was heard a
very heavy cannonading, for about two
hours,fuppofed to be at Port-au-Prince,from
which it was probable that a total destruc
tion of the remains of that town had taken
place.
" A considerable additional number of
labourers (Says a Virginia paper) will be
wanted at the city of Wafiiington, and the
little falls of the Potowmack. It was ex,
pefted the foundation of the capitol and
President's palace would be entered on by
thefirflday of next month, and prosecuted
with great activity. The cut at the little
falls is nearly dug out, and every effort
will be made to get it walled ; and the ri
ver improved to the great falls this season,
So that by Shifting the loadj at tlfe great and
little falls, there~\dllf)y next spring be r.u

reaSons for declining it.âlt is obServable
that Mr. G. continues obstinate in under

On the 6th instant a man named William
Johnlton was executed near Winchester,
iii Frederick county, Virginia, for horse
Healing. He corifeffed Ire had followed the
]-r:iÂ£licfc Upwards of twenty years. This
manjias left a number of children to la

lame time for the murder of \braham Van
Home.âJofhila Abbott, of Berwick, Maf
fachnfetts, was condemned to futfer death,
at .the late supreme court in that Hate, for
the murder of Moses Gubtail.âCnbtail in
consequence of being refufed the loan of a
flax brake,uttered a number of provoking
expreflions and threats of cuffing, &c. which
to irritated Abbot as to induce him to pur
ine Gubtail with a piece of ail ox-fed, three
or four inches thick at the largelt end.
With this he (truck Gubtail on the head
and knocked him down ; he however gol

had taken place since General Dillon' , de

And that it was the prevailing opinion, ai

[Ft cm Albany.]
The directors of the western and north
;rn inland lock-navigation are fummonet
to meet in this city on the 27th instant, for
the purpose of commencing their opera
tions immediately.
As refpefts the western, it is confidently
expected some important part of the canal;
ivill be accomplished this season. The pre
mailing idea now is, that instead of 10 ) ears
this .great and important Work will be ac
complished in three or four years. It is
iippofed by spirited active operations, that
the work will be better and cheaper done
in four years than in ten; and it certainly
will be greatly to the benefit of the proprie
;ors.
The legislature having granted 300 CI. to
.mild a bridge over the Sprouts of the Mo-
Hawk river, whenever the sum of ioool.
Ihould be fubferibed and paid.âA fubferip
.ion for this purpose is going forward with
piritin this.cityâwe are told Gen. Schuy
er has fubferibed 2001. This bridge will
3e one of the longest in America, and will
:>pen a direÂ£t communicatic.n to a very ex
tensive country, progreding fact into fettle
inents, in the north-weft part of this state.
Albany being fortunately situated at the
head of the navigation of one of the finelt
rivers in Americaâonce this bridge and
the canals are completed, it mult incrcafe
with an unexampled rapidity.
The Bank of Albany will commence its
operations this week; there can be 110
iloubt but it will tend to enliven and invi
gorate trade and manufactures, and above
ill to eltablilh a habit of punctuality.
Several French ifiands in the Weft-Indi
:s are said to be in a Hate of anarchy and
"onfufion, in consequence of attempts to
re-establish the old form of government.
Reports fay, that in Martinique a counter
revolution is absolutely effected, and that
several of the leading patriots in Gauda
luupe, had escaped with difficulty to odier
I (lands.
I lie Prince of Conde, according to tlic
French gazettes, is to ast in the combination
agaiuft his country at the head of twenty
thoufimd forces, conlilting of emigrants
from France, and German recruits. ' The
relt of the exiled family seem equally ini
mical, and if the report of the second at
tempted escape of the King fliould prove
true, we may fay with Mr."Gray,
" Weave the warp anil weave the woof
The winding (heel of Bourbon's race-
Give ample room and verge enough
The charaiSers of hell to trace."
T he Bolton Tontine is dissolved, and the
fund appropriated to the Union Bank, a
new inflitution incorporated by the legisla
ture of MafTachufetts at their late fellion.
Sometime since we briefly mentioned a
Brig being boarded off the coafy of North-
Carolina, and afterwards brought into the
Chefapeak, with only a woman on board.
The Crew, who had left the Brig off Ocra
cock bar, and escaped to thefliorc have since
been apprehended and committed

1 here are a few, who seem greatly alarm .
ed at an idea that has been lately started rf
cjlablijhng conjlitutionalfccictics in every part or
tlie United States, lor the purpose of
watching over the rights of the people, and
giving an earlv alarm in cafe of govern
mental encroachments thereupon! Y e t
inch focicties seem absolutely neceflary in
every country, where the people wifli to
preserve an uncorrupted legijlationâ  It is a true
laying, that what is every man's bvfinefj soon be
comes no mail's bufwefs; and those who are not
alarmed at finall encroachments do not
conlider that the reign of tyranny in all the
eahern world has been molt cautiouj'y gra
dual in its approaches. The people under
every new eltabliflied government, and freih
from a revolution, may be compared to a
company of men (landing on a bar or ihoal,
which has become dry by the ebbing of the
lea. They, in general, pay no attention to
the return of the Hood, and when it has
(welled so far as to cover only their feet,
or ancles, they still remain as thoughtless
as ever, and are sure in a few hours to be
overwhelmed fathoms deep, unless there
are some friendly monitors, who will give
them notice of their danger before it be too
late.âAnd this, in governments, is the part
of those focicties denominated Friends of the.
people.
A writer in a New-York paper propos
es the following alterations in the constitu
tion of that state ro prevent eleftioa-Ikiga
tions in future. First, That the govern
or and lieutenant governor ought to be e
lefled for only three years, and at the expi
rationof the said term of three years, the
person holding either of the said offices
then to be difqualified for holding the fame
offices for the next three succeeding years.
That no governor or lieute
nant governor fliall have a feat or vote in
the council of appointment. This will pre
vent any undue influence or creation of
party.
'I hirdly. The governor to commission
ftich qs the council of appointment may
choose to offer.
Fourthly. That no (lieritf fliall be elect
ed for more than one year, and then to be
incapable of holding the office for four years
succeeding.
Fifthly. The council of appointment to
conlift of one member from each -county in
the state, and they to choose their preiident,
and president pro-tempore, at the meeting
of the legiUatures

PERPETUAL MOTION.
(on philosophical PRINCIPLES.)
The following is an account of the Piece of Me
chanism which has so much excited public cu
riosity ; the fubflance ot which was received
from the inventor.
THE POWER
Is at present applied to the machinery of aclock.
This clock, unconnected with the power, is cal
culated to go for two years without winding up,
by the weight of a fiagle pound, that gives mo
tion to a pendulum of twenty pounds, which
moves through the space of 518,400 inches
in 24 hour', while the small maintaining weight
(a (ingle pound) descends only 1- 10th of an inch.
The internal-work of the clock consists of three
wheels. In order that the superiority of this
movement may be obvious to every understand
ing, as well as tothofe t;onverfant with the more
difficult parts of mechanics, it is neceflVy to men
tion, that the common eight-day clock requires
a weight of 14 pounds, when this only requires
a weight of one ; is wound up once in eight days,
and moves a pendulum of three pounds and an
half, where this moves one of twenty, and is
wound up only once in two years.
In 24 hours, the maintaining weight of the
common clock descends lix inches âin this, it
descends only l-loth of one inch
The lead weight which we at present recollect to
have heard ofbeing uLd by thefirft artill in Lon
don's j or 6 pounds,where this requires only 1,
in consequence of the diminution ol friction. So
far it has been thought necelfary to describe this
clock, in comparison with the common one.
We now come to that part to which extraor
dinary merit is to be alcribed.âThe faculty of
winding itlelf up, without the inteivcntion ol
human power. This faculty is derived from the
weight of the aunofphcie, an si can never ccafe
Villi ihcprovifors after mentioned) while the
machine lasts, and while a column of air either
loses or gains one 150 th part of its common
wcii'ht, five times in the fpacc of two years ;
the time which the clock. goes without requiting
aflillance. Or in other words, as long as tiie
change of t!ie weight of the .nr, 5 times in the
space of two years, lhall be such as to cause the
mercury either to afccnd or fall 2-loth's of an
inch in the Barometer, above or below its mean
height. ,
The wearing out of wheels, or of any kind 01
machinery, by fritlion, can never be prevented.
Accordingly, it has never been required in the
Jifcovery of a Perpetual Motion, It is there
"ore fufficient, on that lubjetf, to lay, that tht
jrefent machine, upon a t.nr companion of it:
ritlion with that of the common clock, woult
probably move for live c.lll utr s a [niiod lui
ticient 'or any purpose that can be required..
From late Paris papers.
Situation of lht Frtiiih finances.
Economy, fays an aucient author, is <
revenue ; order is the baiis of econo
my ; calculation is the balis of order
then let 11 calculate and compare wiha'
we. owe with what we have, Each pot
t'ioil of our debt Ihonhl be anKvered by .
particular resource. It will be seen thai
:his comparison will not prove To difadv.nl
rageous to 11s as it is altecled to be believ
ed, and as it is laid to be.
The National debt is divilible in three
'arts. .
1 ft. The debt in annuities, perpetual ant
for life.
Confining in annual interest on irre
leemable capitals, which are as fol
low :
Perpetual rents, 76,845000
Annuities, 102,255,000
[ntereit on debts of cities, 6,000,000
Ecclesiastical pensions. 66,000,cc0
Gratuities and peniions. 25.291 ,oco
276,391,000 liv.
The receipt of public contributions i>
infwerable for the payment of this sum.
uid the faith of the nation is pledged foi
its regular discharge. The engagement
which gurantees this debt is as sacred a
[he constitution of which it is a part. K<:
lower has a right to destroy the obligation.
2d. The debt in affignats.
The emillion of affignats on the ifl ol
March, amounted to, 1,950,000,000. De
luding the amount of affignats burnt, ny
:o that period, there remained in circula
tion 1,531, coo, coo.
The evidences of this debt are, in the
lame of the law, scattered among the
>oorer class, and accumulated in the cof
fers of the wealthy. Every man with one
uindred pence of afEgnats in his posit Ifion
s a creditor of the nation ; on the value o:
this paper, the public fafety depends ; a:.i
he public domains are pledged to redeem
t. The value of the public domains, is â
1,244,000 ; from which must be deduclec
he sum paid on their value, which wa:
employed to redeem the amount ot allig
lats burnt. The national domains, there
fore, now may be ellimatedas a relourct
ifâ1,832,000,000. Almost the i'
herefore mortgaged lor the redemptioi
if affignats ftili in circulation. Ihe re
mainder amounts to a sum of upwards o,
100,000,000 unappropriated, and whicf
nay be set a part for the extraordinary ex
lenditnres of this year, (1792.)
3d . The debt named exigible f demand
ible] because it is redeemable either now
ir at fixed periods.
'oi tion already liquidated 192,000,00 c
To be liquidated , gt7,ooo,oo(
Yt fixed periods 419,000,00 c
Total, 1,528,000,0 cc
The resources for the payment of thi:
Vim are certain : They conlifl of
. 4,500,000 acres of national
wood;, efti mated at 1,350,000,00 c
:. Salt-works, estimated at 50,000,00 c
The sum expected from
the re-sale of national do
mai lis engaged ' 00,000,00 c
4. Sundry credits ioo,oco.ccc
Total sum responsible 1600,000,00 c
Thus the debts exigible paid, a furplusol
up v. ards of So,coo,oco would itill remain-
In the number of these resources, the re
ceipt of arrears of taxes is not included.
Nor the sequestration of the property o:
emigrants.
Nor what may soon be saved by the re
du&ion of public expenditures.
