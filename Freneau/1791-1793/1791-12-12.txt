THE alien t of the king to the confti
tution presented him by the na
tiohal assembly, has completed tin
French revolution. * By this event
which has terminated in the- establish
ment of a free government, the..cffptt
of that body have been crowned witl
success. They have fully accompli fhe<
the object they had in view. Tpthi
Unerring teR of time, the only tribu
rial which-can impartially decide upoi
its merits, the rcTult of their labors i
now submitted.
The magnanimity with which thei
closed their long and brilliant career
mufi have gained the applause of al
parties â ; and by extirpating every-fourct
Â®f dilcontent, given liability to theis
government. The ast of oblivion and
indemnity, which followed with a kind
cf er.thufiafm the fignatijre of the king,
has cast an additional lustre over their
whole proceedings, and exhibited to
the world the lafk remaining proof, in
jheir power, of their patriotism and
benevolerrce. The mere degradation
of "the characters around the throne,
was not in it felt a consideration worthy
their attention ; the freedom of France
â¢Was the object ; and h-avtng secured it
to all her citizens ; even thofo who had
(Jifturbed their councils, and embar
rassed their operations, might comc in,
mingle m the crowd, and enjoy theblef
fi n g*
From the. contemplation of this great
event, if v/? cast our eyes on thole,
wherever they relide, who in the pro
prefs, attacked the principles, and en
deavored to prevent its liittels, wtrar
In ast be the refle&ion of the pious and
benevolent ob.ferver! Will pad fervi
ccs, reverend age, or even accumulated
honors rcfcue them frtÂ»m the indigna
tion of an offended people ? In the ca
talogue of those moil distinguished in
the opposition, the public have been
mortified to find the name of Edmund
Burke. For a rapid and elevated style
of elocution, disinterested republican
patriotism, and general philanthropy,
in the British Senate, he has long en
gaged the attention, and held the con
fidence of the moll virtuous throughout
the civilized world. But how do the
principles contained in the book he has
given Lto the public correspond with
that character ? Or how shall we ac
count for such a change of feothnsat ?
Happily for mankind, and to his eter
nal reproach, the success ot tins revo
lution has given him a silent but galling
reply; and whilst its blessings shall be
acknowledged and cherished by a grate
ful posterity, this performance which
would otherwise have been ccnfigned
to oblivion, will be handed down as
an incident to that great event to per
petuate his infamy.
That the plan of government thev
have given to their country, is the molt
eligible that can, or could have been
adopted, will not be contended. But
that it contains within it, tne elements
of a found and excellent constitution.
with the sure means of progressing tc
perfection, may be demonstrated. On
the one hand, we find the rights of tne
people guarded, by wife fundamental
declarations, from encroachment, and
on the other, the king accepting his

had declined, which as a free man he bad a

been for fpmc competent fettlcment in land ot

ant on it, from them.+ The vices of an heredi
tary monarchy corrected by the ftiemjth and
force of a numeious and poweiful representation
ot' the democracy; and that reprelentation
founded on the most equal, just and enlightened
principles. The right ot lupply or contribution
lecured to them. The privileges o the arifte
cracy abrogated, and its,members reduced, if a
reduflion it can be called, inteTt'ne common.oi'dcÂ«
pi other citizens. The clergy reformed and rc
floreJ, in fiwne niealiire, to the primitive pmity
and Cmplicity of the firil fathers' of the chrrftia!
faith. The local municipalities' or province
dissolved, and the whole formed iffl'o one great
nation. So that, altho' this plan may not b<
allowed f,he merit'of p"rfeSion, as a model, ye
it mud be admitted ta be an excellent tfvog tc
commcnce with.
[f we may be permitted to efhmate its forrorit
by the example of other ceflmcie.s, it will b
found, that foVthe -attainment of'a gitfen end
the security of-the liberties of the people, as we!
in the out-line as the interior modification o
its branches, are to be 'discerned the firongef
proofs of political wifdorn. The extent of thi
representation, which will engage the bed)' a
the people, and bring them forwardimreediatclj
in its operation, is well calculated to put thi
government into motion upon found principles
It will give thfc'm an early'knowledge of th-c:
own weightin theTcale ; and feeling it them
selves, a ccttefpor.dcnt irapreffion will be fet>t
sett by their'rcprefeniatives. Had it been thin
and formed as it eventually ivught, fioni the mo
nied inteteft and the funds, the blessings of th<
revolution might have been loft. The door foi
venality artd cfarruptaon would have been laic
wide open, and the influence of the court ioor
felf in the election and vipon the operations o'
the national aflembly. Deriving their appoint
ments from a different source, but little regarc
would have been paid 'to tlte iiiterefis of ther
nominal ronflitucrÂ»s ; and thus every principle
of refponfibihty have been deftioyed, and the
servants of th-'s people become a new inftru
ment of their eppfefiion.
The iontroul df the alone
hands of t fie n'anowal v. ii'i f>e .-o-iri-j ai

ecutive. It may plan fchenres of con'pie-ft a
broad and tyranny at home, but whit ft it de
pends on the deliberations of a body, thus or
ganized, for the means of executing them, they
will be late. Even the dissolution of tbfc provin
cial afTemb]ies may pe conlidercd ar, favorable
jo the democratic mtereft. Commanding t
portion of their confidence, eVith a hereditary
monarch on the jlrrone, they might have bcei:
tampered with to the prejudice of the people,
it has left the national affeinkly the sole deposi
tory and offfy guardian of the public rights. Will
not this awaken, on the part of the people, <'
more vigilant attention to iheir conduct, and 2
keener sensibility cf injury ? Will not that body
too be more deeply nnprelfrd with the impor
tance of the'truff reposed in them, and feaiful ol
the their conffi'tuents :
But the abolition of the aiillocracy has torr.
up, as it were, by the roots, an mexhaufnMc
source of public difaflers. Ihe hillory of thai
order in thole countries where it hasexifled, pro
perly developed, in 1 elation to its effect upon
focietv, whether it eterived its origin from
usurpation 01 convention, would prove an ufeful
wotk. It would (hew that molt of thofecala
miiies uliich have scourged 'he different nation;
of the earth, have owed their birth to its pride
and ambition. Its mere existence, as it is found
ed in derogation of the rights of the other cla<Je.'
of focietv, upon different principles and with
different'inte'refts, muff uniheath the fwoid ol
civil difeord. It was worth the hazaid of a re
volution to extirpate the privileges of fhat corps.
The unity of the legiliature by the experience
of America, has been found in many refp'eft."
objetlionable, but more particularly, as it de
prives the subject of a fecend examination by a
different body, and who paitake not of the party
spirit and heat of the former. The demonftra
uon here .has been deemed fatkfaQory, that foi
the attainment of wife legislation, the powei
should be distributed into two branches, and lr
conlequcncc, thole ftatts who had adopted a dif
ferent-principle, have reformed their refpeffive
contusions. 'Tis probable, however, that th:
danger of falling on the English expedien*, o!
hereditary legislators in a house of lords, incli
ned them to decide in favor of one only.
The most exceptionable part of their govern
ment. and which bears he strongest marks o!
compromise and accommodation to ancient pre
judices, is the heirfbip of the crown. But a
+ I' : s a new thing to fee kings talte charters
from th * people. I: has been otherwise for
ereat length of time. Indeed in but few cotin

the tyranny of the crown ; that they have one

Upon -a Mirfoiy review, therefore, of the
piinct-ples of the government, it appears -thvu t he
liberties of France have been placed ob a 'fccure
k;lis. A npw political balance has beer) created
between <!ie people and an hereditary

LONDON, Sept 30.
The Declaration of the Emperor and
the King of Pruffta, signed at Pilnitz or
the 27th of August, is circulating at Vi
enna ; in conlequence of which, wt
learn, that Leopold and Frederick Wil
liam have undertaken to restore the li
berty of the King, and the splendor oJ
the French Monarchy ; and that for this
purpofethey undertake to ast with mu
tual accord, in employing the forces ne
cessary for this important purpose.â-In
consequence of this refolution,the chan
eery of war have ordered two large Bo
dies of troops to be ready to march at j
moment's notice, one of which is to take
the route of the Austrian Low Coun
tries, and the other to remain on th<
frontiers till further orders.
M. Montmorin, the French Miniftei
for Foreign Affairs, has formally noti
fied to all the foreign courts, the King':
acceptance of the Constitution.
of the foreign courts have yet though
proper to take any public notice of thi:
notification.
There is hardly a kingdom or state or
the continent but prohibits the impu
tation of French newspapers upon the
fevered penalties. Their folly is almoi
equal to that of a certain antient Senate
Herojlratus had burnt the famous temple
of Diana, in order that his name migh
become immortal. The Senate were re
solved to dil'appoint his wish, and paffec
an cdift, that no person under penaltj
of Suffering death, Ihould pronounce the
name of Heroftratus.âThe confcquence
is, that the incendiary's name has taker
root in lli(lory, and will never be forgot
Nothing, is a stronger proof of the
general confidence in the {lability of the
outline of the French Constitution
than the prices at which Church anc
Crown lands have fold. Fromthecom
mencement of the sales, the prices have
been from twenty-five to fifty years pur
chase, the average.about thirty ; and ai
present national property cannot be
bought at lets than thirty-three years
purchase. The price may be eitherpaic
immediately or by regular installment;
in the course of eleven years, but with
five per cent, interest on the balance til!
paid.
The Princes of the German empire
have referred the whole of their con

and the proceedings of the National As

to abide by whatever he shall advise ir
that business.
The illiterate race of Ottoman, ene

Greeks Bizantium, afterwards Conftan

Iftambole. The situation of this city
for commerce, is beyond all doubt fupe

The King's acceptation of the Con

lowever, was afraid of exposing herfel
:o the hoots and hisses to which she ha:
seen some time accustomed ; but, M. d(
la Fayette assured her she would mcse
â vith nothing but applause ; and so 1
proved when the walked out in tin
evening with the King in the garden o
-he palace. 1 his knowledge of the
disposition of the popular mind, and the
ascendency he has over it, has made the
:ommandant-general (Fayette) regretted
jy the Royal family. It is laid, that the
uppreffion of his post was a great deal
swing to his own management. He was
ealous of any one's holding it after
lim, and wished to disappoint the rivals
,vho aspired to fill his place. As he

D E P E N D E NT TERRITORIES
ARE of two kinds. FirjlâSuch as yield to the superior slate at once a mono"
poly of their uieful productions, and a market for its fuperiluities. Thefcj
by exciting and employing industry, might be a source of beneficial riches, if an
unfavorable balance were not created by the charge of keeping such poffefli
ons. Ihe Weft Indies are an example. Secondâthole, which, though yielding al
io a monopoly and a market, are principally lucrative, by means of the wealth
which they heap on individuals, who transport and dissipate it within the fupe
lior Irate. This wealth is not only like the former, overbalanced by the cost of
maintaining its sources , but resembles that drawn, not from industry, but from
mines, and is; productive of similar effeasâThe Eafl-Indies are an example.
All dependent countries are to the superior slate, not in the relation of chil
dren and parent, according to the common phrase, but in that of (lave and
matter, and have a like influence on character. By rendering the labour of the
one, the property of the other, they cherish pride, luxury, and vanity on one

On Friday the 9th instant, the Governor of this
state met both Houses of the Legillature in th<
Senate Chamber, and communicated his Speech
on the bufiiiefs of the present leliion. Amonj
other obje&s contemplated in the Speech, was
the opening of the navigation of the Sufquehanna
a plan for forming a communication by water
with a few ealy carrying places, from the Ohio ti
the rivers (particularly the Delaware) falling inti
the Atlantic Ocean j and a negociation betweei
the states of Pennsylvania and Maryland fur th
purpose of uniting the navigation of the Delawar
and Chefapeke bays, and thereby opening a nev
avenue from this port to the ocean.
ON the 27th of Augult last a letter was laid be
fore the National Afiembly of Fiance, from th
inhabitants of the illand of Sr. Pierre and Mi que
lon, near Newfoundland, praying /applies of pro
vision.â" It is the lot of these unfortunate peo
pie (fays a French paper) to exist upon barrel
lands, and even there to contend with their neigh
bors, theEnglifh, for a miserable subsistence 01
codfish. Perhaps the best mark of our regard so
them would be to return this* wretched colony t
â old prance."
Ex t raEl of a letter from New-York, Dec. 9.
Nothing new from this place at present, ex
cept a fire, the evening befote ialt, which for fom
time wore a threatening afpedl. It happened ii
John-Srreet, in a building belonging to Mr. Hal
let, a coach-maker, adjacent to the Theatre.â
No sooner was the alaim given that the Tibeatr
nvas itt danger, [which is in fadt the Church o
many people] than people of all ledts and partie
exerted themlelves in an unprecedented manne
for laving the building from ruin. The efforts o
one perion in particular were wonderful, 'win

literally fought with the flames, tor the preierva

f.âid to be a piece of the most consummate polic<

the grievances under which they laboured, wtl
iivw be d'aeited, and the government be again fuf
tered to enjoy a ftatc, if not entirely tranquil, ire
ac least from mtettine commotions.
A London paper of credit has the following pa
yagraph under the Vienna head of Sept. 10. 44 1 h
measures which the Emperor seems to have take)
with the King of Prussia relative to France appea
daily more serious. If the declaration which wi.
shortly appear at Pans blithe part of those tw
monarchy, & which will be seconded by similar de
cUratioas onthe pari: of fevcral courts of the foutJ
and north oi Europe ftiail be absolutely ineffedtua
and if the negociations in which the winter may b
employed terminate but in ufeiefs conferences,ther
can be no doubt but iceues of deflru&ion and car
nage will take place the ensuing spring. The pre
parations making for that fatal purpose are not 0
the bluÂ£lei:ng kind, but they are not for that reafoi
the ,cfs certain. Many bodies of troops hav
begun their march from different parts of th
Auilrian States towards the Rhine 1 len battalh
ons and as many squadrons have just received order
enjoining them to make all the necefi'ary difpofiti
011s to enable them to follow the fame rout.
' 4 With refpedt to the.,reports circulated, relativ
to the plan of attack , and of the campaign, whicl
tlie allied princes have agreed upon, there is reasoi
to think that all is not authentic ;but exaggeratioi
and error in details do not deitroy the exiitence 0
the design.âThree armies will certainly be affcm
bled, to"ail against France on the fide of Germany
The firft will be assembled near Luxembourg
where 30,000 Auftrians will be joined by all th
PruiTian regiments on the Weliphalia eftabliih
xnent. The second will be alTembled in Bnfgav
to consist of twenty battalions of Hungarians am
Croatians, of ten squadrons of Auftrians, cavalry
and of the double contingents of the cities of Bava
ria, Franconia, Suabia, and the uppeer Rhine
The third will be colle&ed 111 tlie environs o
Worms, and will confitt principally of the troop
at the two circles of Saxony.
About the hour of ten, on Wednesday night lad
the large workihop of Mr. James Hallet, nearl
adjoining the Theatre in John-street (New York
took fire, and was entirely consumed. The Ihe
aire was in great danger ot meeting the fame fate
having caught fire fevcral times; but through th
exertions of the citizens, was ultimately preserved
It is said the building caught fire in the fourtl

ExtraEt of a letter from a gentleman in Mer

â¢' The defeat of General St. Clair, or
the 4th inft. cngrolTes all our thoughts
we had 600 men killed and wounded
all the flores ioft, and 7 pieces o
Artillery. This engagement happenec
about 15 miles from the Maume Village

"â  General St. Clair, expe&ed ar

with fixed bayonets ; but mod of the

General St. Clair rallied them anc
wrought off the greater part of the wound

ibout 5 miles, where the remains of the
irmy and wounded are cooped up, almoll
larved, living on poor pack-horl'es.
'Â« The people of the diftrift are pre

md EwingâMercer, Colonel M'Dow
â ll,uind myfelf, with a number of young
eltows.; we (hall carry provisions to the
xarrifon, and bring oif the wounded.'"
By a gentleman who left Kentucky or
.he 15th instant, we learn, that ou;
friend the Mountain leader, was ou
with a party of white men at the time o
:he attack-, and it was feared they havi
fallen a facrifice likewise.
The following is a tranjlaticn from a paper print
cd at Cape-Francois.']
ACCORDING to the accounts takei
in 1789, the total number of (laves, men
women and children, in the ten parish
ss now revolted, was fixty-cight thou
Tand fix hundred and sixty-sour. Fron
:his number, if we dedutt two-third
r or old men, women, children, and in
/alids, there will remain, capable o
ifting offenfively, twenty-two thou
sand, eight hundred and eighty-eight.
There have been killed or woundec
;n our engagements with them, 4000
which will reduce the numberto 18,888
From these again we mull deduÂ£
4000, who have either returned to thei;
tnafters, ,or are concealed in the wood
for the purpose of giving themfelve
up. The number we have actually t(
:ope with, is 14,888 âand of this num
ier there are at least one-half who wen
forced into the ferviceof the insurgents
without arms, and incapable of makin*
â efiftance in cafe of being attacked.â
3f this 14,888 there are not a fifth par
Puinifhed with muskets or pistols, ant
his fifth parts amounts to 2977. âThi
whole of this number are fcatterec
through the ten quarters, which give
1400 to every quarter, but the neceffit)
as providing fuflenance renders thei:
parties very unequal.
Of the 68,664 negroes that have re
volted, 30,000 may be deemed 1011, ei
:her by being a&ually killed, or be
:oming wild in mountains to whicl
there is no access. The value of eacl
of these negroes may be eflimated a
2500 livres each, which makes Â«th<
whole loss in revoltednegrqes, 7500000 c
livres.
The lodes incurred from the deftruc
tion of 172 sugar works, plantation
lioufes, cattle, &c. &c. is reckoned a
111,800,000 livres.
The lolfes in buildings, produce, anr
;he cattle on 936 coffee-plantations, is
-131,400,000 livres.âVillages, cottoi
ind indigo plantations, and cattle
auildings, &c. upon them, are eftimatec
at 6,400,000 livres.
Total 10f5â324,f00 ; 000 livres.
IF Louis the Sixteenth (fays a London paper)
fliould not now make the best of Kings, the fault
mult be his own, as the ctifcipline he has experi.
:nced in his person and family, wiih the thorough
leformatfon in Church and State, must have, in n
great measure, effaced those prejudices with which
every royal mind is but too well furniflied, till in-
Itrudied by the precepts of the law, and the firm
nefs of the people. The methods of governing a
Ipirited, populous, and extensive empire, are so
plainly laid out, that it is next to impoilible that
cither the King or his Minillers can mistake the
road. There are also spiritual advantages secured
to the Monarch j for by being deprived of his own
will in all public atb, he must necessarily avoid
those crimes which a deviation from the rules of
known juflice are perpetually accumulating on the:
cxercile of arbitrary power. The maxim, " that:
the King can do no wrong," is a reality in France
âHe whose wings are clipped cannot flv over the
constitution*
A lengthy plan has appeared in one of the late
Bnglifli papers for emancipating the Haves in the
britiih Welt-India islands : the substance of which
s as follows : I. " A royal proclamation to be if.
,ued for every individual planter in those islands,
o stock liis plantation with a proper number of
legroes of both sexes.
2. Two or three years after the iflTuing of this
icr, let a general emancipation take place. Let
:he slaves upon every plantati n be valued,
ind government then the matter* for such Haves
so emancipated. At the lame time let the con
dition of this emancipation be, that the slaves /hall
pay yearly such sum out of their labour, as may
[>e determined by pailiament.
3. The mail 1 shall after the emancipation, fuf
fer all those who were his slaves to remain on the
:ftate, and let them occupy their houses, and the
ground which they formerly did, without paying
any rent so long as they continue to work for the
lame master ; but, if they fliould leave the eltate,
to forfeit to hirn both house and land. Thisme
:hÂ°d w 'll oblige the servant to continue in the mas-
Jtr s employ.
4. It has been advanced, that the emancipation
>f the negroes in the Engliih Weft-Indies would
end to injure certain manufactories at home.âlt
â¢ well known, that there are nearly one hundred
houfand blacks in those islands, and it is equally
lVe 1 k-iown, that the blacks in general are nearly
laked â now, if these people were but moderately
>aid for their labour, is it not to be supposed thac
ley would dress in a very different manner from
A>hat they do at presentâ then we may fay that
Adhere there is one Shilling now laid out in Englifli
nanufa&ures for the use of the negroes, there
jvould be forty, if the people were free.
5. It has also been said, that if England emanci
3at?s her Haves, other nations will not do it. Nei
:her need she care whether they do or not. When
he slaves are once made free and become citizens
here will be no longer any fear of trusting them
-vith arms. Each ill and will then be adequate to
its own defcnce, and there will be no neceflity, in
.afe of invasion, for fending out white troops to
the Well-Indies, which generally proves their
grave.
If this plan or something of the kind is not
adopted, it is to be feared that the present trou
bles in Hifpaniola will prove only tjie beginning
of sorrows. The period of timefeems to have ar
rived, when America is becoming too ponderous
for European domination. Let us therefore fall in
with the natural current of and by being
the firft nation to recognize the rights of men,
of whatever colour, lay claim to thejfolid glory of
extending a (hare of that freedom beyond the Atla
ntic, which every Briton pretends to conflder as his
Birth-right."
