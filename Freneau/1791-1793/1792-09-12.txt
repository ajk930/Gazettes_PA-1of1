PARIS.
Particular detailof the irruption into the 7'hutl
Lries by the Paris mob, on IVedne/day the
I iM. July.
THE King agreed, conformably to
the-conftitution to receive a dcpu
tation oÂ£ 20 persons, and pointed out him
felf the manner in whith they fliould b
introduced. They were to pais through
thc gate of the Feuillans, and go out ci
the gate du Menage.
These orders of the king were Cent tc
the commander in chief, who opposed to
them'lie orders received from the muni
cipality, enjoining him to leceive, untie,
the standard of the national guards, peo
ple of all denominations, dressed in all
kinds of unifotms, and provided with any
kind of arms.
The piktmen in their ma-cn had taken
the declaration of rights, which was car
ried before them. The colours of the Ba
ftile, and the men of the 14th of July ap
peared among them. For a banner they
had an old pair of breeches, from the mob
perhaps being called here, ' Sans Culot
tes "
By three o'clock they had defiled
through the hall of the afiemb'y, in the
rear of the palace, through the garden, the
guard haring refuted to oppose them, and
round by the Quay to the place de Caro
fl, in front of the Chateau. Here t> ey
were joined by eight pieces of cannon, and
two caifTons of ammunition. Afler half
au hour spent in pkrlyingj the entran.e
being refufed them, they proceeded to
force" The commandant of the guard re
quired authority from the mayor and mu
nicipality to repel them, but was rcfufed.
The matches were lighted, and every
thing seemed to pre'ude a formal battle,
when the officer returned to announce his
having received no orders. Ihe gates
wert- instantly forced, no rcfillanc-e being
made and the people in thousands prec:-
pitated themselves into the palace : tht
doors at the entrance of the king and
queen's apartment* being closed without
waiting to hare them opened, they (hal
tered them to pieces.
The queen retired to a second apart
ment with the dauphin in her arms, ant:
threw herfelfupon the protection of a re
serve of grenadiers of the national guard,
H ere a third door was broke open. Tie
crowd became, so great, that with difficulty
the queen found a corner of the window tc
tfcape from the great press. Here, expo
sed to all the gross and vile language that
i pagination can conceive, {he was obi ged
to remain for fcveral hours, during w ,ich
they prcfented her and the dauphin with a
national cockadt, which ihc immediately
wore.
Duving this scene, another of a differ
ent nature went forward in the king's
apartment : one of the chiefs of th s mob
presented the king a red bonnet, adoined
with national cockades, and demanded the
retraflion of the Veto which th king had
placed 011 the decree agaii.ft the priests,
arid for the ellablifhment of a camp His
answer was noble and manly ; "If the wel
fare of .he nation consists in wearing a red
cap, I have no objection to wearing it.
Pureinconfcier.ce, I have ro diead ; as
to the decrees, this is no time to speak ol
them I"âSome ( ne having remarked that
he was afraid, hefeized the hand of a gre
nadier near him, and clapping it upon his
heart, he said, "Tell me, my friends, does
my heart beat like a man in fear ?" He
immediately ftsted himfelf between the
windows of his apartment, that looked to
wards the Thuilleries, and put on a red
cap. One of the mi.b offered him a glass
to drink to the health of the nation; he
accepted it, and drank it without seeming
to have the smallest apprehenfmn.
The crowd began to preis upon h;m

out of his place, near his majesty. "The
King," crias this brave fellow, " is our
fafi guard, I would not d fert him, for a
hundred thousand crowns !" A munici
pal officer attempted to fpetk, but could
not be heard. Several members made the
fame attempt without luccefs-
M. Santerre then tried what he could
do ! a roar ensued, of "Long live PethiotiL'
Long lire the good,the worthy Pethion !"
The good, the worthy Pethion then addres
sed the king. T>e people (fsys he.)" have
appeared with dignity, and with dignity
t!iÂ»y will depart. Your maj fly may
make your'elf easy," Santerre ordered
the eputation to cQme forward.
The fpokefinan accordingly demanded
that the patriotic ministers be re-inflated
âthat the Veto be retra&ed relative to
the two obnoxious decrees.
The King answered :
â¢'I have sworn to maintain the conftittiti
an A: I will defend it at the risk ot my life "
Clamours were renewed of "Long live
the nation ! Long live Sans Culottes !
Long live liberty ! No Veto 1
The eyes of the leaders of the mo 1 ?, and
jf many of the mob themselves, gliltened
with rage. "Long live Santerie*!"A
grenadier at'empted to quiet them, the
cinjr told him, "Let them alone, my
riend ; let their words be ever so injuri
ous, it is all the fame to me."
By t'. is time feveial deputies, alarmed
it the state of the royal family, had aflcm
iled, and a deputation of 24 members was
lamed to surround the person of the king,
ind to be replaced eveiy half hour b, a
Yefh deputation, so as to inform the as-
Vmbly of the ilate of his majesty. M Pe
hion arrived about the fame time with tin
ieputation. The people flill Continued
heir clamouvs, for the reft'ration of the
ate miuiftry and the fan&ion of the
iecrees ; but in vain ; the king retained
he fame manly firmnefs & conversed with
he deputation without tile imailed appear
ince of inquietude. By persuasions and
ntreaties, the mayor and four of the depu
tes prevailed upon the people to withdraw.
They had pafT.'d all ovjr the palace, the
â¢oofs were covered wicii the multitude,
:'ney hung in .cinders to the windows;
ind except the breaking of some doors
ind windows, no other mifchief was done,
10 accident even ensued.
Towards night-fall the Palace was en
:ively cleared, the deputies had previous
y profited of an interval in the affluence of
he crowd, and conducted the king to h s
sed chamber. Towards ten o'clock all
.vas quiet; the citizens a"l retired peaca
aly to their respective homes and the night
ivas pafled in the utmoll tranquility.

lad exptefT'd their desire to get rid of all
efponfibility and leave to the generals the
vhole conduct of the war. Luckncr has
low declared, that unlrfs the ministers
joint out to him the plan of operations
,vhieh he is to follow, he mufl be under
he necessity of tefigiiinghis command â
[n fact a general dcfpondcncy seems to
lave seized all who are placed in public
ituations. From the temper of the times
md the ptevalence of the violent party,
:hey are reduced to that word of all def
p.tir â the drfpair of being ufeful. The
;onduÂ£t lately obCervea to M. la Fayette
ias not a utile contributed to produce this
ler.fat'On. lie has not only been the ob
ject of the moil unqualified abuse in pri
vate conversation; ar.d at the meetings of
the clubs, but has been denounced to the
aflembly in the speeches as members, and
in petitions prelented againfl hint ; and
yet who could have forfeeen that this La
Fayette, to whose aifivity and ze~l the re
volution is so indebted, should have be
come the objedl of popular odium and ac
cusation, and at tlic moment too when lie
was engaged at the head of his army, in
dcfence of that constitution which he had
so greatly contiibuted to establish.
The retreat of the army in the piefent
instance to the French territory, was per
haps no more than what prudence ?nd po
licy requi'cd. They had been far from
meeting from the inhabitants of Flanders
with the reception which they expe&ed ;
those in genera', to nfe the expreflion of
Luckner, shewed themselves in different, if
not hostile to their cause. Beiides, there
was danger that had they remained longer
or advanced f, ither into the country, they
might have been lurrounded by the forces
of the enemy, and tints cut cfF from the
pofiibility oft e; rest.
Numb. ()r<
The Ar.(lrian and Prufiian armies are
ntnv advancing in full force, and it haa
become necessary for the troops of La Fay
ette and Luckner, who haJ jo'iued in or
der to act in concert and with more effeift,
to separate and return to the flation*
which they formerly occupied, that they
may cover the whole of the frontiers, and
leavejno openiag to the enemy. It is
probable therefore, that tile hiilory of the
campaign may now take a different turn
from that detail of petty Ikinnilhes with
which it has hitherto been occupied. The
plan of the additional forces proposed to
fubflitute the twenty-thousand men, which
â¢he affcrnbly had decreed to convene at
Paris, is not yet fetiled,
The plan of the war is totally changed.
\s soon as the new ministers were fairly
eated, they adopted the only plan that
:ould be with wifd -m adopted, an-i that
)ught to have been originally soâthe
alan of a defenfive war. It was not the
iufinefs of France to go into F1 mJcrs, and
:o excite infurreftion. It was calculated
.0 make ihe Engiith and Dutch gov eru
ments their enemies, who could not fee
â¢with indifference an attempt to deflray the
earner between France and Holland.
France also is to be affailcd on the fide
>f Alsace and Lnrtaine, by which avenue
lie is etfily acceffibte. In Flanders (lie is
trongly fortified, and so secured against

MUCH declamation h?.s been indul
ged against certain characters, who
arc charged with advocating the pernicious
d- ' line, that "public debts are public
bjeffings," and with being friends to a per
petual on of tlv public debt of the coun
try Among these characters, it ihe se
cretary of the treasury lias not been na
me ', he has been pretty plainly alluded to.
It is proper to examine what foundation
there is for those charges.
That officer, it is very certain, explicitly
maintained, that the funding of the exist
ing debt of the United States would ren
der it a national blefiing: And a man has
only to travel through the United States
with his eyes open, and to obfeivethe in
vigoration of inditfiry in every branch, to
be convinced that the pofiiion was well
founded. But whether righturwrong.it
is quite a d fferent thing from maintaining,
as a general proposition, that a public debt
is a public blelfing : particular and tem
porary circumstances might render that
advantageous at one time, which at ano
ther might be hurtful.
It is known, that prior to the revolu
tion, a great part of the circulation of the
country was carried on by paper money ;
that in confcquence of the events of the re
rolution that resource was in a great mea
fute destroyed, by being discredited, and
that the fame events had destroyed a large
proportion of the monied and mercantile
capital of the country, and of personal
property generally. It was natural tu
think, that the ciiafm created by these
circumstances required to be supplied, and
a just theory was fufficient to demonflrate,
that a funded debt would answer the
end.
To infer, that it would have fucli an cf
feÂ£t, was no more to maintain the genera
doctrine of " public debts being public
bleflings," than the faying, that paper e
millions by the authority of government,
were ufeful in the early periods of the
country, was the maintaining, that the)
would be ufeful in all the future stages ol
its progress.
But to put the matter out of all doubt
aud to (hew how destitute of candor the in
sinuations against the fi-cretary of the trea
fury, on this head, have been, I have ex
tracted and (ball iiifert here some paflagei
from three of his reports to the house ol
representatives ; by which it will be seen,
that his conduCt, as well as his language,
have been in uniform opposition to the
doCtrine cha-ged iipon him. The lengtl
of these repofts, it is probable, have pre
vented many well disposed persons frorr
being acquainted with their content#; the
preemption of which emboldens the ca
lumniators of public charadters and mea
fnres to make assertions, of the falfliood ol
whic'>, the mere perusal of official docti
nients would coriviCt them.
ExtraCt from a report of the secretary
of the treasury, on the subjeCt of a provi
sion for the public debt, presented the 14th
of January, 1790.
" Persuaded as the secretary is, that the
proper funding of the present debt, will ren
der it a national blefling ; yet he is so fai
from acceding to the position, in the lati
tude in which it is foinetimes laid down,
tlia- "public debts are public benefits," a
position inviting to prodigality, and liable tc
dangerous abuse, â that he ardently wishes
to fee it incorporated, as a fundamental max
im in the fyflem of public credit of the Uni
ted States. that the creition of debtJhouL
always be accompanied with the means of ex
tinguishment. This he regards as the trui
secret for rendering public credit immortal,
And he pre fumes, that it is difficult tc
conceive a situation, in which there may
not be an adherence to the maxim. At
least he feels an unfeigned jtlidtude, that
this may be attempted by theUnitedStates,
and that they may commence their mea
fures for the tftablifhment of credit with
the observance of it."
Extract from a report of the secretary
of the treasury on manufactures, prefentec!
the yth of Decembei, 1791.
After uiing several arguments to illuf.
trate the operation of a funded debt as
capitalâthe fecrctary concludes thus :
" There are respeCtable individuals, who,
from a jufl av, rjion to an accumulation of
public debt are unwilling to concede to it
any kind of utility, who can discover no
good to alleviate the ill with which they
suppose it pregnant ; who cannot be per
suaded, that it ought in any sense to be
viewed ac au increase of capital, least it
(tiould be inferred, that the rcore debt the
more capital, the greater the bnrtheni, the
greater ilie bleflings of the community."
" But it intcreds the public councils to
edimate every object as it truly is; to ap
preciate how far the good in any nieafure
is comjJenfated by the ill, or the ill by the
good ; either of them infeldom unmixed."
" Neither will it follow, that an accumu
lation of debt is dcjirab!:, becaule a certain
degree of it operates as capital. There
may be a plethora in the political, as in
the natural body ; there may be a slate of
things in which any such artificial capital is
unnecrjfarj. The debt too m<y be swelled
to such a size, as that the greated part of
it may cease to be ufeftil as a capital, fcr
ving only to pamper tire dilfipation of idle
and diflblute individuals ; as that the suras
required to pay the in'ereli npon it may
become oppressive, and beyond the means
which a government can employ, confid
ently with its trdnqnili y, to raise them ;
as that the resources of taxation, to face
the debt, may have been (trained too fartu
adn it of extensions adequate to exigen
cies, which regard the public fafety "
" Where i his critical point is, cannot bt
pronounced ; but it is impofiible to be
lieve, that there is not such a point."
" And as the vicissitudes of nations be
get a perpeiual tendency to the accumula
tion of debt, there ought to be in every go 1
vernment a perpetual, anxious antl
effort to reduce that, which at any time exifls
as fafl as /hall he practicable, confidently wit),
integrity and good faith."
l.xtraft from a report of the secretary
of the treasury relative to additional sup
plies for carrying on the Indian war, pre
ienteil the 16th of March, 1792.
" The result of mature rifledtion is, ir
the mind of the secretary, aitrong convic
tion that the hill of the three expedients
which have been mentioned (that was th<
railing of the sum irquired by taxes) is tc
be preferred to either of thÂ« other two."
" Nothing can more intered the nation
al credit and prosperity, than a condanl
and fydematic attention to hujband all tin
means previously poffeffedfor er.tingui/hing th,
present debt, and to avoid, as much as poffi
ble, the incurring of any new debt."
" Neceflity alone, therefore, can juftifj
the application of any of the public pro
pertv, other than the annual revenues, tc
the current service, or the temporary, am
casual exigences of the countryâor th:
contracting of an additional debt, b)
loans, to provide forthofe exigencies."
Great emergencies indeed might exist
in which loans would be indifpenfible â
But the occalions, which will juftify them
mult be truly of that description."
" The present i 3 not of such a nature
The sum to be provided is not of magni
tude enough to furniih the plea of r.ecef
fity."
" Taxes are never welcome to a com
munity. They seldom fail to excite unea
Ty sensations more or lefÂ» extenfne ; henci
1 too strong propensity in the govern
ment of nations to anticipate and mort
jage the resources of posterity, rathei
.han encounter the inconveniences of z
present increase of taxes."
" But this policy, when not dittated bj
very peculiar circumjances, is of the worj.
Unciâlts obvious tendency is, by enhanc
ng the permanent burthens of the people
o produce lading didrefs, and its natura
fTue is in national bankruptcy. 99
" It will be happy, if the councils of t hit
â ountry, fandionrd by th,â¢ voicc of an enlighten
â¢d community, [hÂ»il be able to pursue a differ
ourfe."
Here is exampK added to precept ;
In putfuit of a dodtrinc, the oppolite oi
that which is charged upon him, the se
cretary did not fc-uple to hazard the po
pularity of his adminidration with a class
of citizens, who, as a class, have been a
mong the firmed friends of the govern
merit, and the warmed approvers of the
measures, which have redored public cre
dit. The circumstance indeed has been a
weapon dexterouily wielded againd him
by his enemies ; who in consequence of
the increase of duties proposed have repre
sented him as the oppred'or of trade. A
certain description of men are for getting
out of debt ; yet are againd all taxes for
raifiug money to pay it off; they are
amougd the foremolt for carrying 011 war,
and yet will have neither loans nor taxes.
They are alike opposed to what creates
debt, and to what avoids it.
In the firlt cafe, their meaning is not
difficult to be divined ; in the lad it would
puzzle any man, not endowed with the
of fecoiid fight, to find it out, unless
it be to quarrel with and pull down every
man who will not consent to walk in their
leading firings ; or to throw all tilings in
to condition. FACT.

LITTLR other notice of the futile reply
of Mercator to Civis is necefl'ary,
than merely to put in a clear light the erro
neoufnefs of the standard, which lie has a
dopted for calculating the arrears ofinte
| relt to the end of the year 1790.
He takes for his standard \\\e present an
nual interest on the whole amount of the
public debt, as provided for under the fund
ingfyjlcrtiâthat is, ift. upon the former prin
cipal of the foreign and doineftic debt : â
2d. upon the arrears of intcrejl of that princi
pal, which on the id of January 1791, and
not before, became principal, by the provi
fious of the funding law:â3d. Upon the
whole amount of the a {Turned debtâthat is
2 1,500,000.
Now the fact is, that the only arrears,
which can colorably be computed, are those
011 the principal of the foreign and domcjlic debt.
according to the terms of interelt, which
they aHua/ly bore, up to the ill: Jan. 179;. â
ill. became, in faÂ£t, the arrears of interelt
011 that principal did not bear intcrejl till the
ift Jan. 179 1. and coafequently no intcrejl
whatever accrued upon them. And 2d. became
the government of the United States took
up tne Hate debts, as they flood at the end
of the year 1791. âIf arrears of interelt ac
cumulated, in the mean time,'twas the af
fair of the Hate governments, which were
the debtors and alone rel'ponlible for a pro
vision for it, not of the government of the
United States, which only became respon
sible by virtue of the uflumpt'ron, from the
time that it took effect, that is from the Ift
of January 1792 ; from which period the
interelt has been punctually paid. This is
the true view of it, unless it can be (hewn,
that the government of the United States is
answerable for the neglects and omissions of
the Hate governments. âBut, what arrears
may li3ve really accumulated on this part
of the debt is unknown ; as it is under
stood, that there were in feme Hates a pro
vision for the interefl.
Calculating then the arrears, which did
actually accrue, that is 011 tile principal and
interest of the foreign and doineltic debt,
the former, according to the various rates
which were stipulated upon it, and the lat
ter at 6 per cent, the rate which it then
bore, from the ill of August 1789, to the
ill ot January 1791, from which period in
terest iia; been paidâtiie amount is 3,003,

Mercator has been inattentive to the means
of information, he ought not to come forth

In a mere question of the mcreafe and de

and the balance will be in favor of the
United States.

candidly applied, namely, that of setting of:

As to the concluding remarks of Merca

But it was not fufficient for Mercator to
alfert ; he ought to have (hewn what la ri

them.âNot having eione it, 'tis fufficient
to observe, that oik-good effect of the liiea

the present government, is at lead unequi

[lare not trust the appeal to such a Test.'
Convinced of this, they have combined all

Philadelphia, Sept. n.
For the National GazÃtte.
A WRITER in the Gazette of Satur
day last, after several observations,
with regard to certain charges, which have
lately been brought forward against the Se
iTetary of State, proceeds to make or inli
iiuate several charges against another pub
lic charaaer.
As to the observations which are designed
:o exculpate the Secretary Of State, I Ihall
:lo nothing more than refer to the difcuf
ions which have taken place and appear tÂ»
jein a train to be pursued, in the Gazette
it the United States.
As to the charges which have been bro't
Jgainft the other public charaaer alludett
.<), I (hall afl'ert generally, from a lou*, inti
iiate, and confidential w.tf*
lim, added to feme other means of inform-
Jtion, that the matters charged, as far
is they are intelligible, are either erofsly
nifreprefented or palpably untrue.
A part ot them, is of a nature to speak it
elf, without comment, the malignity and
.urpitude ot the accuser, denoting clearly
he personal enemy in the garb of the poli
cal opponent.
1 he lubjea and the fltuation of the
les naturally unpofe silenceâbut this is not
â he hrit attempt of the kind that has been
made ; fru.tlefsly hitherto, and I doubt not
equally Iruitlefsly in time to come. An
jpimon on the experience of fifteen years
:lie greateit part of the time, under circum
tances aliordiilg the belt opportunity for
in accurate estimate of charaaer, cannot
be fiiaken by slanderous surmises. The
charge ot which 1 (hall take more particular
notice, is contained in the following passage
-"Let him explain the public charaaer,
alio, it uncontradicted fame is to be re
garded, opposed the Couftitiition inthe Crand
Convention, becanfe it was too republican.
md advocated the Britijh monarchy as the per
tedjlandard to oe approached a's nearly as
he people could be made to bear.''''
This I affirm, to be a gross mifreprefen
ation. To prove it so, it were fufficienC
oappeal to aimgJe fact, namely, that the
rentleman alluded to, was the only mem
>er from the (late to which he belonged
yholigned the Cftnftitution, and.it is noto
â¢ious, against the prevailing weight of the
>fticial influence of the fiate, and against
vhat would probably be the opinion of a
arge majority of liis fellow-citizens, till
Mter information ihould cor rea their firft
mprefHonsâhow then can he be believed
o have opposed a thing, which he aauallv
'greed to, and that, in so unsupported a
ituation, and under circuraftances of such
Peculiar relporriibiliry ? To this I (hall add
wo more Jaas ; cue, that the member in
luellion, never made a (ingle proportion to
iie Convention, which was not conforma
ble to the republican theory ; the other
hat the highelt-toncd of any of the propol
ition.", made by him was aaually voted for
>v the reprefentatioHs of several dates, in
eluding iome of the principal ones, and in
dueling individuals, who, in the ertimation
jf those who deem themselves the only re
publicans, are pre-eminent for republican
charaaerâmore than this I am not at li
berty to fay. It is a matter generally unÂ«
ilerllood, that the deliberationsof the Con
vention u hich were carried on in private
were to remain undisturbed. And every
prudent man nmft be convinced of the pro
priety bo h of the one and the other.âHad
the deliberations been open while going on
â he clamours of faction would have prevent
;d any fatisfaclory result. Had they been af
.eiwards disclosed, much food would have
jeen afforded to inflammatory declamation.
Proportions made without due reflefUon,"
and perhaps abandoned by the proposers
themselves, on more mature rreflt-aion,
would have been handles for a profuiion of
il-natured accufatlon.
Kvery infallible declaimer taking his own
ideas a the perfect llandard, would have
i ailed without mealure or mercy at
member of the Convention who had rone *i
lingle line beyond his standard.
The present is a period fruitful in acctr
fation. Much anonymous (lander has ami
v\i!lhe vented. Ino man's reputation can
oeiafe, if charges in this form are to bÂ£lightly lifted to.' Th?re are but two
kinds of anonymous charges that can merit
attentionâWhere the evidence goes
with the chargeâand where reference is
made to Jpecijic faffs, the evidence of the
truth or falfehood of which, is in t/ie power
or polleffioii of the party accused, and he at
liberty to make A free use of it. None of
the charges brought forward in the present
instance, fall within either of these rules.

LONDON, July [6 .
txtrad of a letter frotn Lijlc, June 7 â¢Â».
Not only the interior state of affair? be
gins to Wear a most unfavorable afpeft, but
the exterior tranfa&ions seem ominous of
no better success, and M. Luckr.er's main
army, instead of proceeding to the attack
of Tournay, find's no little difficulty in
maintaining their feeble post at Courtrav.
The Auftrians advance every day in par
ties, and annoy the French oh the very ram
parts. On Saturday morning Tome pea
sants having brought information of a co
lumn of Auftrians advancing from the
Tournay fide, Mefirs. Carle and Jarry, whe
command the advanced guard, put them
selves at the head of their troops, and
inarched out against the enemy ; a flight
affair enftied, in which the loss 011 both fide;
amounted to about twelve killed, and a:
many prisoners.
Marshal Luckner, who had already paid
his visit to the poll, was returned to Me
nin ; but, on the news of this affair imme
diately went back to Courtray with the ge
neral officers, and marched to the attack ;
he exposes himfelf with much temerity,
and excites, on that account, 2 great deai
of anxiety.
Yesterday morning the Aitflrians rÂ«urn
ed to the assault in greater force, and 3
more serious affair occurred ; it began a)
five, and lasted two hours ; during which
great courage was displayed on both (ides.
The French had twenty men wounded, anc
about twelve killed ; amongst the former,
Lt. Gen. Du Chatelet received a caiinor
ball, which took off the calf of one leg, ant.
killed his horse under him; an aid-de
camp also received a wound in his head
The French remained on the field till ele
ven o'clock, when the enemy having disap
peared, they returned to the camp ; bin
llrong rumonrs prevailed, thnt the Auftri
ans were resolved upon coming in ftil
greater force to renew the attack.
Unless the main army moves from Me
nin (which is two leagues off) where the)
are still encamped, to reinforce their ad
vanced guard at Courtray, no doubt bul
great {laughter will tifeielsly take plact
there,the Auftrians not being at all afraid tc
diftnantle Tournay of the force in its gar
rison : but it seems that M. Luckner's ope
rations have been limited, otherwise he
wowld before now have marched his whole
force againfl Tournay.
Mean time the odious scenes tranfaftec:
at Paris within these few days, have so ge
nerally disgusted all the few remaining re
fpeftable commanders in the army, thai
they talk of giving in their dismissions.
Four officers have deserted from Cour
tray since Friday ; amougfl whom are the
Colonel of the firft regiment of Chasseurs
on horse back, and two adjutant-majors.
Belides this, in many of the battalions, there
reigns an obstinate spirit of disobedience anc
dru'ikennefs ; in (hort, their extent oi'patri
olifm seems to be the meafiire of their cla
mor in bawling " CA IRA."
It appears to have been a miftatement ir
the public prints, which reprefc-uted thai
the States General had fignified adifpofitioi
to join the cause ofAuftria and Pruflia a
gainst France, and that in this the provinc
of Holland stood much forward : on tin
contrary, the prevailing politics of thai
province are more difaffefted towards tin
existing government of the States, thar
those of any other, hence we may con
clude, that the wifli of that quarter wouUi
rather be in favor of the French; howe
ver, the fart seems to be, that the Sladt
holder and his friends have no delign to
concern themselves at all in the affairs of
rranee, but unite in sentiment with Eng
land, and preserve a drift and honorable
neutrality ; at the fame time, this condu.
will best answer the purpose of their own
internal politics, as to keep the difaffeaed
in Hollaml in aw e requires all the vigi
lance of government.
i he new minister of Spain has relaxed
somewhat of the tifual severity refperting
the prohibition of the French and other fo
reign newspapers ; the pretended watch
ulnefsis still kept up, but exceptions are
ealily obtained. Complaints having been
received from the ports of the ignorance in
which this prohibition kept the merchants
refpefting foreign affaire, has been a princi
pal cause of this relaxation of severity 011
the part of government ; and mereover, it
appearing, that such a prohibition more
strongly excited curiofky, at the fame time
that the political principles enforceel in the
foreign papers might make a deeper impres
sion, if clandeOinely ft tidied in private, than
if permitted publicly. 011 these accounts
the vigilant eye of government is turned
from all papers which are not of a direct
seditious tenelencv.
Sunday morning was decided, in a field
behind Kilburn Wells, an affair of honour
b?tv/p?n the Earl of Lauderdale and Gene
ral Arnold.
Th? d fpute arose from the following
part ot Lord Lauderdale's speech in tfu-
House of Lords.
'â¢ If apoftacy is a recommendation to com
mand, the Duke of Richmond. of all offi
cers, is the best entitled to that of the camp
at Bag(hoc, provided the name of Genera 1
Arnold be (irlt (truck ou'the lift."
The principals, with their seconds and
surgeons, arrived upon the ground aboui
leven o'clock, occupying a post-coach an*
two post-chaises. Having taken their fta
tio:is. Lord Lauderdale refufed to toss uj
with Gen. Arnpid. As the General though
hiftifelf injured, his Lordship infilled upoi
receiving his tire firft.
When General Arnold had difchargei
his pistol, Lord Lauderdale declared, tha
lie never had (aid or meant any thing again!
his private character, and having no person
al enmity towards him, would not (ire
the seconds then interfered ; and such be
ing the disposition of the parties, it is eaf)
to perceive that the aifair was soon fettled.
Thefeconils were, to Lord Lauderdale.
Mr. Fox; to Gen. Arnold, Lord Hawke.

Second affair in India between a French and En"

A I ligate, mounting ,10 eighteen pound
ers, commanded by "Vs. St. Felix, who
erved the whole of last war under M. Suf

he o.'Hcer returned to M. St. Felix, who in
1 few hours sent Irrfi back, with orders to
nform the Commoddre, " that he meant
o get under weigh early the next mor

â oinmodore would rot prcfume to im'pede

The corfimodote instantly made aflgnalfor

A the French frigate were decidedly of opi
nion, that they had no right to obey the
dictates or ;i democratic enthulialt; or ven
ture their lives in engaging a Britilh fliip at
ihe moment of profound peace with that
nation. The Captain threateneel them
v\ith the vengeance of military power, in
which, after i'ome confutation among
themselves, and some gentle but ineffectual
remonstrances with M. St. Felix, they came

The \ eotnanry, where they liave come

:in honelt negative to tile addrefles. They
.lave r.o influence upon their minds, but
that of truth; unconnected with the court,
find out of the reach of its beams, they are
actuated by the impulses of honest patri

withstood at once the combined torrent of
i oyal, ministerial and aristocratic power ;
and thus, wherever they are moved, they
will demnnftrate to their country their ir
refutable superiority.
Letters, received over land yesterday
from Bombay, via Suez, state, that the
confederate powers had fettled their res-
shares of the three crore3 and thirty
acks, paid by Tippoo, as follows :
The Nizam 4-i6ths

They likewise confirm the report ref

What fignifies quibbling, where the effect
is the fame ; bribery is called corruption

not to be branded with any stigma. Bribe

influence hich cannot be detected as a con
tract of bribery, however such influence may
be in effect, is not bribery.
It is really requisite to difcirfs the mat

be called bribery. No ! no ! places and

These were written immediately after

under the Ukraine; that the Poles were
upon the point of yielding to the superiori

on the enemy's flank, obliging them to re

ExtraEl of a letter from a gentleman at DarwilU
(Kent.) to his friend in this city, dated Aug. io.
" By two men who were made prisoners
it St. Clair's defeat, and who ran away
from ail Indian town on the St. Joseph's
-iver.about the roth of July, we are assured,
that all our flags have been facrificed by the

as the regular troops, who bore one of the
lags, reached the (..laze river, where the*
:hiefs of many nations of Indians were a r ~"
embled to hold a grand council ; that he
delivered to them a belt and talk, which
was read to them by an Kngtilhrnan ; upon
which a council was held which ended in a.
Jetermination to reject every offer of peace;
uid to put to death every American thac
hould fall into the~r hands ; that accordâ
ngly major Trueman and his party were
omhawked, and their bodies thrown into
he river. They also inform that colonel
Hardin, one of the most valuable citizens
jf this state, who carried another flag, was
idled by the Wiandots, and that that tribe,

;very reason to believe "the above intelli

man, and he remains so now in the mind, or th.

but they fay h: went to England, and there wrot.

to thole of the revolution, then these old polite
cians will be proved to have been fools or mad
Inch, and will be laid alide.
There is T.m Jeff"/'", uncle, he is a Sccretarj
they fay j you know he compoled the Decla.a
tion of Independence, and moved for it firft it
Congress . he was an old whig, attached to ic
publ.can prirciples. He had a great lead in timt
of the war, and lie n.adc the peace, they fay he i:
a very particular friend of the P.efiuent but tnr\
abuled him in the Centinel the other dayâthe;,
bring high chatges agair.ft himâthey lay he
in France when the cohflitution of the genera
government was oifered to the people for confid
eratioo, and he, as one of the people, prcfumptu
cif.y, dared to think for IrtnftlfâOh monftious
He ventured, they lay, as one of the people, !
propole amendments, with an intention to mak.
i: plain, certain, unequivocal, and intelligible,
and thereby to secure, better, the rights of the peo
ple.â It is a great picy that he did not succeed ;
for if he had fucceedcd, the great men, who gin
gle the bell to the tune of five tbeufarJ dollarj c
year, might have understood the meaning of it.
whereas, now, they go d. .vn to NevT-H.tmplh.re,
laying doubt eggs in every nelf on the road, then
go back to Philadelphia to get aid in their incu
bative faculties, and when they return they
hixhâNothing.âBut they fay, uncle, that Tom
is at the head ol an impo. taut office in the gener
al government, and keeps a printer to find faoli
with tne administration j not his own 1 1 uppol
this is a ferrous chargeâll he prints fallhoods, h<
may be detested, if he rÂ«afons wrong upon agreee
fails, they may point out his errors, and the peo
ple will not mind himâEut her: is the rub, un
cle ; these men fay the people a,e nut judges, afie
are not fit to be truftec. âA man when he accepn
an office, is luppofed, according to the rules ol
the old woild, to give up trie leelings of a citizen,
and is never to complain ol the mal-adminiftrn
rion of his co-adjutorsâThe end of placing a mar.
in office is to buy him silence j and he is ne
vei to alarm the people when corruption prevaii
in the government. For a man at the h:ad ol
cne department, to fay to his mod confidtntia
f.iend, that the man at the head of another
might have done full juflice to the public (pecu
lating creditors, and laved half the public debt, it
high treason, whether it be true or notâTo fay,
as.Congress in the year 1774- in their address tc
the people said, that " inlenCble taxatun has a
tendency to coriupt the government, and to en
llave the people," is an unpardonable crime . Tc
fay that all this pretended plenty of money, i
imperceptibly drawn from the toil of the laborious
part of the community, to enrich ftockhohie,:,
will never be forgiven, for the truth is not to be
i>ken at all timesâFor a man at the head of a
oepartment, to fay that it was corrupt in the nun
offtate to be purcbafing up public fecuriiies, at a
low price, from the oiiginal holders, while they
were contemplating, and had agreed upon the
funding system, is very wrong, tor the k.ng can
do no wrong. To fay that fame members ot a
late Congress invented Â« kind of machinery,
calico a Bank, and contrived to have the (hare*
filled up in on: day, to exclude the greater part of
thecommunity, and to raiie m-unta.ns ot wealth
for themselves, and a tew others, whether it be
true or faife, ii a daring inful: upon parliamen
tary, and govemmentary priviieges jâthey fay
lie and his printer, find fault with an aflkmbly
of men, v.ho have leo tne pc ipie in the oa, cl
their danger and diltreft and who havejuftl.
earned their confidence. But MHarry Sly-Btt s
fays, that a late aflemb.y had fomemen in it, who
were formerly (he people's enemies, and who ne
ver had a true relish for civil liberty, andalway.
were at war with the revolution, and with repub
lican principles. Some others who were boys,
when the people were m danger, and knew no
thing about the conteft âTom may look upon
these with contempt when they wax faucv.
There is another great man, uncle, his name
is George Clinton, he has been guilty of poUcfim;
the confluence of the people tor many years j he
it a mofi abominable democratâa terrible repub
lican, he led the aflemblies and the annies of th.
p. ople in 1774, and so through the war ; he wa.
the foul of liberty in the state of New York â
pull hirn down fay the old toriesâhe may have
thought, that the adm.ni Uration of a government,
which by a magic opeiaiion raises mountÂ»ins of
v-ealth for some men, on the powerful labour ot
the people at large, is not a good adminiftration â
