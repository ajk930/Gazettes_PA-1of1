FXTRACT from Governor Miffi.in's
Speech to b-th Honjes of the LJJJlatw e
ef this State â 
" 'â¢pHE state of the Union,and of Pen 1 ' yl
-L vania, as an important member oi t.ie
Union,renders the present fslii â¢Â» peculiarly
fortunate. The exunfive commercial in
tercourse that fiibfiits between the United
States, and some of the belligerent power.,
of Europe ; the foiemn obligations o; trea
ty, by which we are pledged to others : â
thefentinients of a cordial friendllnp, which
cement our alliance with one party ; ar.d
the jultice which, as a nation at peace, we
owe to all the parties;âarc considerations
of filch variety and importance, as.can
not, I think, be contemplated by any pa
triotic citizen, without foiicitude and ap
ureheniion. But, however great the diffi
culty may be, under these circum.lances,
of preferring Â» neutral character, in a
manner univeiT.illy fatislactory, it is cer
tainly the duty of those, with whom the
adm'miftration of the public is en
trusted, to attempt the arduous talk :and,
1 am confident, that, recollecting the ca
lamities, which we have formerly expe
rienced,' an I refteftnig, wi'h becoming
gratitude, upon the present profperotit
conditio .of our country, you will appro* e
and (aiiftion every just and coullitntional
exertion, that is calculated to maintain the
dignity of our government, and to avou;
a participation in the war.
Upon this meritorious principle, anil in
order to put the citizens of America on
their ?uard, at this critical period, the
Pre fide nt ifljed a Proclamation, declaring
that the duty and interefl "t the United
States required, that they ihouid, with
Sincerity and good faiih, adopt and pmfue
a conduit friendly and impartial towards
the belligerent powers ; and, as the letter
which communicated, this proclamation,
expreflctl a confidence, that injunctions
interelVing to the happinefsand profperit)
of the United States, would have the be
nefit of my aid, to promote their genera
and ft rift ttbiervaace in Peivnfvlt inia, 1
thought it incumbent upon mc, I Itewife,
in the molt public manner, to rccomio nd
the fubjeft to the attention of my fellow
citizens; and to exhort them faithfully to
contorm to thedi:pofition, which thePre
fident had officially recognized and pre
scribed. . .
This amicable and impartial difpoGtion,
being thus announced, on behalf of the ge
nera? government, some occurrences soon
rendered it ueceSfary to provide an ade
quate & prompt remedy, in cafc of any vio
lence being committed by the belligerent
powers; upon vessels within thejurifdiftion
and protection of the United States , or in
cafe any of those powers, tiionld conimiffioii,
arm. and equip privateers within our port;,;
a practice deemed i.ieonfillent with the
duties of neutrality, and dangerous to the
peace'of the nation. Accordingly, in the
c.ipacity of commander in chief oi the mi
litia of the commonwealth, I received in
structions from the President of the United
States, to interpofo ill either ot those
events, and, with the aid of the militia,
to detain the aggreffor,in the firft instance ;
or the privateer in the second : until the
Prtlident f; ould decide upon such further
proceedings, as the occasion might require.
'These infh uftfons being immediately com
municated to the Board ot Wardens, with
a reqt;E ft that they would pay a vigilant
attention to the fubjeft, 1 w as afi'ured that
proper measures would cheerfully be pur
sued, for ascertaining and reporting, with
ontdelay, every traiilaclion, that appeaV <1
to militate agaiÃll the peace and neutrality
of the port.
Permit me here, gentlemen, b. iefly to
recapitulate the fevcral cases that have oc
curred under the Prcfident's instructions:
referring however, for a more particular
statement to the documents which X have
directed to be laid before y.ott-
The firft was the cafeof theftiip Willian .
brought into this port as a prize to the
French privateer called the Cit'r/.< 11 Genet,
but captured, as it was alledped, within
the limits of the protection of the United
States. The court of admiralty for thiâ 
difrict having decided against its own
jurifdiftion, as to trying t .e merits of th u
allegation, the President reuuefted., that I
would order a party of militia on board of
the (hip. for the purpose of keeping her in
1 fafe cultody, until his determination should
be had upon the fnJ-ijett. With this requeit
| I immediately complied ; hut, upon it'

A few days subsequent to this tranf.iaion

tarrying 16 guns, provided with a letter ol

-eferringto the treaty of amity and cons
inerce between the United Stales am
Prance, he reque-fted that orders might be
riven to prevent this vefiel from entering
.'lie harbor. UpÂ»n enquiring, however,
nore, particularly into the fails, the mallei
â .varden reported, that the lliip came fi
ller to take in a cargo for the ifiaud ot Ja
maica ; audit appearing that her eiUiip
nentsund commiflion were intended for
>1 oteaion. in a coLirfe of lommerce, ani'
ot for ofrenlive war, 1 did not conceive
hat the cafe was comprehended within the
irovifions of the treaty ; and, therefore,
"Ã¼bmiited the consul's representation, snd
ill the documents relating to it, to the
Preiident : whole opinion. 1 believe, cor
-efpopded with mine upon the fubjea.
Though such were the sentiments enter
ained on the arrival of the Jane, it war
oon suggested, that her captain, having re
itted her in a warlike manner, wasendea
lourjng to incr'eafe the number of her
mi?n and guns. A vigilant attention was.
therefore, tneu to all her operations: ard
every article of authentic intelligence that
I colieaed, w as, without delay, transmit

veflel might be flopped, in cafe (lie ftiotild
be augmenting her force, and about to
depart. On these points, conclusive evi
dence was, at length obtained ; and be-
cadie ir.y duty to provide, with the aid oi
Lne fhilitia, for detaining her. But in the
course of a eofrelpondeoce with the Pre
sident on the fubjeft, I was informed, that
in conftqiience of an arrangement with the
British uruifler, it was deemed imnecffary,
at that inoment, to interpose with the mi
litia ; although it was expected, that I
should jÃ.mpioy filch means of coercion, a:

credit) has been expended, with the drifted
economy, in maintaining the men, railinj!
.he platform, ai d making the indifpenfible
epairs at the Fort.
The advantages of this arrangement be
came every day more apparent; particu
larly, when the Prelident, in explanaiior
jf hi 3 general inlirudtions, for preserving
tiu.r neutrality, declared, that no privateer,
which had been, or should b* fitted out.
within the United States, (hall be permittee
:o find an asylum in any of our ha, boars,
and th. t every prize, taken by fnch priva
teer, li.ould befeized, on her arrival with
i,i the j.irifdiÂ£lion of the refpeftive dates,
for the purpofo of being restored to hei
owners, at the time of the cjpturc. Pay
ing a due attention to the President's De
llaration, you will perceive by the papers
whicli I have directed the secretary to de
liver, that the French privateer, called the
â¢ itizen Genet, e.ne prize taken by her, ant
iour prizes, taken by the Little Democrat,
have already (and almofl all on one day'
required an inteipolition of the militia,
wh ch, mil .fs a party had been a finally or.
service, and a battery Creeled, at Meld -
Iflatid, could not have been procured with
funcient facility and dispatch. S<-me be
nefit has, likewise, I believe, been pro
dnceef by thcfe means, in relation to the
peace and order of the city, which, at one
! erioel, were so ihnoyecj, as to induce the
'nayor to ree]ueft a detachment of militia,
,11 aid ot the civil authority: And. upoi:
ihe whole, it is not improbable, that the
knowledge of our being prepaied to refill,
may happily contribute to prevent, an in
traction of'the neutrality cf our port."
NEW CONSTITUTION or FRANC&,

National Convention.
DECLARATION if thr RIGHTS of
MAN n'lilofth'j CITIZEN.
THE French Peoplt:, convinced that
the neglect and coatempt of the Natu

[Total Numb. 193 ]
misery in the world, have resolved to set
forth in a foiemn Declaration, those ("acred
a.tcl unalienable rights, to the end that, it
being in the power of every titizen to com
pare at all times the proceedings of govern*
ment, with the end of every social compact,
they may never fnffer themfeives to be op
prefied and debased M tyranny ; that the
people may ever have before their eyes i: e

ult and tifeful to society; and prohibit
Â»11!y what is hurtful.
5. All citizens are equally adniilfible to
niblic employments. As ee people know
10 other motive of preference in their
â¢ieftions than virtue and talents.
6. Liberty is the power which man pof-
Vfies of doing whatever is not hurtful to
:he rights of others. It is founded in na
;ure ; its bounds are marked by juliicc ?
aw forms its protection, and its. ntwral li
viits are defined in this maximâl3o not to
others, what you would not with done to
yourfelf.
7. The right of eXpreifing thoughts and
opinions either through the medium oi the
press, or any other manner ; tie right of

The society owes relief to unfortunate ci

22 Inflruftion is rieceflary to all : soci

23. The fociai compact consist; in the

retired to private life, to mix with our

Excellency, that we had served our coun

form all they had promjfedâbus ft'om. the
weakness of government at that time, ant
their resources being conducted by a finan

That as there remains in the hands ol

we so painfuliy earned, which we conceive
may be paid to the original creditor, with

glory in it.
A modern anti federalifl, then, is one
who is lincerely attached to the conflituti
on of his country, which has proceeded
from the people ; but he is difgufled with
ail administration; who have nothing lef
in view than the good of their constituents,
whose servants they are.
He fees with infinite regret, that not
w rhltanding the burthens under which our
commerce groans, the revenue is exhaulieil
in large and ulelef- salaries. and squandered
on a Inift of speculators, who receive fix
per cent, per an aim for a debt which coli
them 2/6 in the pound.
He contemplates with equal regret, that
instead of paying off the national debt,
everv ingenuity i > exerted to saddle us with
it forever. With these ideas of the funding
system, lie execrates it as the mod perni
cious for the liberties of the people whirl
human ftibtlety could have devifrdâThs
n.fluence occalioned by it cannot tail tc
terminate in the deltruftion of a republi
-an government, which he verily believe:
a . the principal object in view by more
than one who had an agcncy in the framing
of it.
He comp'ains loudly, that after so long
1 peace, not a lliip of war been builtâ
1 town fortifiedânor any other meafnre:
idopted to protect our sea-ports and cum
merce from the insults of those who chuff
: ) make them the object ot their_depreda
ion.
He feels warmly attached to the Frenci
â¢evolution âHe confidefs our generoui al
lies as engaged in the cause ot mankind, iS.
deprecates, ts the worlt of evils, a wai
with the only free nation on earth, whicl
lie verily believes will be the confequentt
of certain public measures now pursuing.
While with his whole foul he withes tha 1
France may crulh her foes, he fees, witl
an honest and just indignation, the infolen
treatment we submit to from Great Bri
tain. They have forts in our territory
and we submit to the indignity. The;
plunder our trade, and we dare not evei
remor.ftrate. He thinks tie present a fa
vourable time to compel that haughty na
tion to iiften to the dictates of reason, an<
to comply with her treaty ; but he nuul
(cars that the weighty arguments of Bii
:iih\oi:i, will deprive 11s of the op
portunity of a\ enging these insults offeree
:o our national sovereignty,
He detells the corruption of the Britifr
1 ovtrument, ahd v ilh horror, a con
nection with a nation whose liberty is a
name, and whose exar pie would be per
nicious to an infant republic.
He abhors a tory, whether of home or
"oreign growth : and particularly withes
:hat a speedy stop may be put to the impor
[ation of those of Brit'lh and cot Li Ih pro
duction.
Lastlyâa modern anti-federalifl is sin
cerely devoted to the v. eilare and prospe
rity of his country, and although public
.aeafures wear an unfavourable aspect, he
hopes thegenius of America will yet inter
fere and protect her offspring, againll the
too open attempts of an aristocratic faction.
10 erect a monarchy 011 the ruins of free

THE United States of America, are?
pofieficd of more natural advantages, lor
I'rade and Commerce,than any other na

tliefe benefits for succeeding years. i haC
ri;ey liave not been realized, is said to be
awing to the imbecility of government.
Vet not one of the great advant.-ges, that
was expe&ed to arise from tlie federal go
vernment, was so fondly expected as tom
nercial prosperity. This idea we have
r omid delnfive. The government of Grea"
Sritain, liath received more advantage
Vorn this event, than her mod sanguine
riends could expect. Without any treaty,
lie has eftablifliments in all the Oates, and
iy the advantages of a similarity of habits
md of language, {he draws to her coders
he wealth while (lie effectual- â¢
y prevents our intercourse with her islands,
and puts every cblttuftion to impede -our
;rowth and prosperity as a nation ; among
which are, the retention of our welteTn
softs, and theharaffing our frontiers, by rr>
jredatory war, both' diflrefiing and enor
noufly expcnlive.
" Spain, who neVer wifhedour profperi
y, and is naturally inimical to the name

if our weakness and inability, to avenge

To Mejrs. JAY and KING.
YOU thought proper, gentlemen, quit,
ting your high and dignified stations,
to come forward, on the twelfth of thii
month, in the public p pers, with th<
.following very extraordinary publication :
" For .he N. York Diary.
" MefTrs. Prin'ers,
" CERTAIN late publications rendei
it neceflary for us to authorise you to in
form the public, that a report having
reached this city from Philadelphia, thai
Mr, Genet, the French minister, had said
that he would appeal to the people fron
certain deciln ns of the President ; we wen
asked, on our retu n from that place
whether he had made such a declarator
âwe answered, that he had, and ive aid
mentioned it to others, authorising then:
to fay, that we had so informed them.
JOHN JAY,
RUFUS KING."
Having descended from your car of pow
er and pre-eminence, and voluntarily adopt
ed the refpedtable title of tell tales, permil
me to remind you, that we Hand exaftlj
on the fame footing of plain un. ided cili
Zens, wiih this only difference, that, while
you have enveloped your tale in difgraccfu
tiarknefs and dtfigning obfeurijy, I fhal
endeavor to express rr.y observations or
both you and it, in a plamnefs of diciioi
and simplicity of (lile, of which no one
can avoid underfianding the true meaning,
and I will venture at leall to hope, ver)
few will disavow the propriety ofâexcept
âthe enemies of republicanismâthe wel
wishers to the combined armies in theii
nefarious warfareâ'.he fvcophants of pow
erâthe admirers of dark envenomed fcur
rilityâthe timid detdlers of manly open
nefa and generous franknefsâwith fom<
few others of your bed, warmed and moil
partial friends and dependants.
Before I enter into particulars, permit
me farther to observe generally, that at Â£
me ting on the last ele&ion, for firft ma
gillrate of thin ft; te, I said so much ii
your favor, Mr Jay, as to offend, in ;
very high degree, all my friends who wen
present, and were opposed to your filling
that high and re eitahle ofiice
It is with pleasure too, I confefs, tha
I have read, with inexprcffible delight;
many of your charges to grand juries, ir
your present dignified station of chief jus
tice of the United States.
The services you have rendered to thi;
country, I will admit to be great, noi
ought one adl of petulant turbtilency tc
obliterate them from a grateful heart ; anc
I iincerely wifn, for your fake, that ther<
was only one ast of that nature to com
plain of.
Having found but very few good King#,
in my perusal of either sacred or profant
history, I cannot fay, Mr. Rufus King,
that your name has created any allurements
on try mind to warp my sentiments ; and
not having the honor of your acquaintance,
but in a very flight degree, 1 mult rell
contented with my knowledge of your ge
neral character, in reflecting, that I have
heard much more said in tavor of youi
stern integrity 33 a man, or your fhininj
abilities as an orator, than of your decided
firmnefs as a republican.
Having ptemifed thus much, with res
pest to yourfeives, let me next view, I wi-i
not fay wi h a friendly, but with an im
partial eye, the features of. the untimely,
unnatural, ill begotten, and yet apparently
very favouiite child of your conjoined
; though appearances are at present
againd it, the drooping head of the dar
ling infant may yet be supported for some
time, through your parental care, and the
unabated attention of its friends and ad
nvirers ; for I have not, since its birth,
converted with a torv, who did not speak
of it with rapture, and seemed desirous of
becoming its nurse.
Do not despair, gentlemenâThis vir
tuous and refpe&able class of men (for
they are not all citizens) have become your
firm, your established, your unalterable
friends, and will certainly continue so until
yoa alter your present system, Br I have
heard some of the warmed of them fwenr,
"By the love thev bore to this country ana
its eonflitution," that they would willingly
defend the legitimacy of your and tiieii
darling, at the vifque of their lives and
fortunes ; exclaiming, with a degree ol
joy bordering on phrenzy, that it carried
in its front such insignia-os wisdom anc
design, as to leave no doubt that from the
fame stock, th:re would fpnng out oihei
branches, vvtich, in process of time, would
amend all the evils in our government,
and plare us in that deledtable situation,
spoken of by the great and good Edmund :
Burke with foch heavenly (and, therefore,
to the base born) unintelligible rliapfodyâ
a situation which, for m;-.ny years, they
have fpr.red no pains to bring about, and
which, but for the ignorance and rustic
perverfenefs of the <whigs, they would long
ago have accomplished.
With what Chriltian meekness and be
coming fortitude mult you, gentlemen,
have behaved for some timejpaft, to have
thus converted your formerly greatell and
mod relentless enemies, ictÂ» your firmeit
and mod determined friends.
You, no doubt, 1 ope, that you will not,
by this condudt, lose one of your old ad
herents.
Time will evince to the world, whether
:hefe hopes are, or are not, delulive.
Perm t me now, gentlemen, to inform
you in what manner I intend to examine
:his your very uncommon product on â
ill. I will endeavour to exhibit to our
"ellow-citizens the original view you mo!i
probably entertained, v. hen you firfl ven
ured to whisper the Tale, and deduce :n
---erences therefrom to Ihew, whether your
licencing from your r; fpedtive high fla

A FLATTERER.
New-York, August 27, 1 793.
Extract Jrem the Minutes of ihe Katior.al
Convention.âJune 4.
A letter was read from the commifiion
â rs of the convention at Niort, near Ro
:hel|e, dated 28th May, by which it ap
peared that fucce'.s had itill attended the
;ims of the insurgents j but that affairs
pegan to look bet'er.
" Our army" f.iy they, " which the
lay before yeilerday was composed of 1200
rien only, is now more than twenty thou/and
trong. When firll Informed of our dan
ger the "neighbouring â¢ dillridts rose in a
jody to cur alliltance ; one of them, the
liftridt of Mille, has not a single man left
it home. But the greatest part of these
patriotic citizens are pofiefTed of no arms
>ut their zeal for the Republic."
They further mention the arrival of 400
ps the hufTars of the Legion des Alps, and
icoo or 1200 infantry from Poitiers ; Ge
leral Biron was also arrived; and theimme
liate attack of ttie rebels was determined
)n as soon as a fufficicnt force (hould arrive
The departments of Cantal and Lozere
sere in a Bate of infurreftion. Thearmyof
he rebels in Lozere confuted of 8000 men.
June 24 It appears that the infurgent3
pad hurt their canfe by the'r appetite for
plunder. The People of the neighbouring
iepartments were violently exasperated a
jainftthem, Their army began to dwindle,
py a great number having fa'let off from
hem. Five thousand had already left them.
June 26. The committee of pub ic fafe
:y laid before the convention the answer of
general Wimpffen to the minifltr of war.
[ Ie had been ordered to Paris togiv} an ac
;ount of what had palled at Caen. Wimpf
:en in reply wrote that he would go to
Paris at the head of 60,000 men
A decree of accusation was palled againfl
Wimpffen.
June 29. Intlte fitting of the convention
of the 28th June, a let'er was read from ge
neral Biron :âThis letter announces a bril
liant vidtory gained over the rebels in the
department of la Vendee. As it appeared
the intention of the insurgents to make a
movement towards St. Maixent and Niort,
general Weftermann was detached to in
tercept them. This officer immediately
gave battle to the rebels, routed their
army, took a great part of their artillery,
ijo head of cattle, and all tlieir (teres.
'I hey have nlfo been defeated in fiveral
other places. Ihe patriots of Nantes have
repulfcd them and put 400 of them to the
bayonet.
Thegarrifon of Valenc ennes in a sortie
defiroyed several of the batteries of the
besiegers.
In a letter from general Birojy, read the
27th, dated the 22d of June, it appears
that a detachment under general Chalbos,
and brigadier-general Salomon had defeat
ed a party of the insurgents, killing 200
of them and taking 20 prifoaers. The
army of the Republic did not lufe a single
man. General Biron complains of want
of discipline.
General Cuftine was at the head of the
army of the North, as appears by a letter
from him to the Convention, in answer to
the calumnies of general Farriers, tlated
Aire, 23d June, 1792, in which letter
he mentions two small advantages gained
by the troops of the . Republic, under
generals Leveneur and Lamorliere, over
the advanced pulls of the allies.

by t' e privateers <f the powers at war,
and it being polfible that other inllsnces
may have happened, of which, no inform

I have it in charge f.om the President to
allure the/merchants of the United States,
concerned in foreign commerce or naviga
tion, that due at'ention will be paid to
any injuries they may fuffer on the high
seas, or in foreign countries, contrary to
the law of nations or to exiiting treatic ;
and that on their forwarding hither well
authenticated evidence ot the iame, propei
proceedings will be adopted tor their re

aggrefiions and vexations 011 our citizens
or their property.
There being no particular portion or
description of the mercantile body pointed
out by the law's for receiving communica
tions of this nature, I take the liberty of
addrelfing it to the merchants of Phila
delphia, for tbe State of Pennsylvania,
and of reauefting that through them it
may be made known to all those of their
State whom it may concern Information
will be freely received, either from the
indiv duals aggrieved, or from any afToci

to take the trouble of giving it, in a cafe so

I have the honor to be with great

Sir,
The merchants of Philadelphia reccive
your commumc ition, as one proof among

to the commerce of the United States,
â vhich involves in it every otner important
interest of our country.
They will avail themselves of the invi
tation given, to convey all filch informa

vexation and spoil committed by the pri
vateers of the powers at war, upon the
trading vessels of America ; and they doubt
not upon representation being made, thoie
powers will fljeiv the bell clifpolition to
retlrain aggrefiions, which, being exercifcd
against a people, who, in maintaining a
