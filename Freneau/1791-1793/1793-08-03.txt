Gentlemen,
a SINCERE confeffiun of error, has at
all times been deemed the ftrortgeft
f wom of philosophic virtue, as well as
of apoltolic faith. Under the pleating im
produced b. this sentiment, I now
acknowledge, how much I have beer# mis
taken and even frightened, with the ac
counts of " instrumentality, â¢ tur
ni bed in several of your late papers. Upon
the tii ft reading, my imagination magnified
and multiplied each d ftinft fyllaj'ff ot in
jtrd-MEN-ta- li-ty into a complete
Hvdra, which I have beer, told wears li
ved monstrous heads, andeach head teemed
bulily igfd in devouring the products oi
tlie whole induftriotis labour 4 ot Amc ica ,
the imagination *vas more alarmed when
conteindaring the complete and entire
fabric of this devourtng rt'ontfer, it seemed
so v:t v ancf compiie ued, rhat all the

v,Â»\\ Ite.him, and I thought even the
rov? Â£ lilio 'me of France (which I am
told ci.-ts off but one head at a stroke) i-pon
anv poflibie exteiVho'n ot its machÂ«n-iy>
would probably be baftied in such a Â£0111-
p'jx. )2r ition ; Mft my fears and amaze
ment were bevo'.icF meaiur#, when I touncl
that to its or carnal Uru&ure and strength
was added the vxgVfativ'S quality of the
LABARUM or cross of our
blefled S WIOUR, which all good Chr.f
tians te-tainly knrow'vffirMflied for a time,

"'ThisjpntU. e, : E -"o taw âº U

to the true hift'ory ot IntlrUmeotality, it

ot this Instrumentality remained in Europe
until it had completely discharged ali the

France, (a)
Other parts of it, finding scope for advan

versed the Atlantic, and upon its arrival
here regardless of its imperfect organiza

But as there appears to have beeii rio

therefore fairly inferrable, and may be a]-
ferted with eqiial truth, That it was squally

After this solemn panfe, hear a sage
Admonition : Keep friends with Inflrn
mentality, for I ain told that some raft
fellows, who lately ventured to anger him,
a severe rap over 1 lie knuckles, and
thought themselves well off at that.
It is doubted, whether Inflrumentality
be an artificial coirpulitipn or fabric, or a
natural production It certainly fnrnifhc:
flronÂ» analogies to nature ; inception,
growth, diffemm'atidn, decay, and thepow
,r of re-prodilfUorf, are common to the
whole animal and vegetable kingdoms; the
whole of these properties are attached to
Inftruin'ehtality. The various transforma
tions of Inllrumeniality, and the different
offices performed in each ftatc of exigence,
lee.n *00 tvowfrerfuf to obtain credit wit);
f.mie thick-(villi infidels; but we may here
continue to rrace its analogy with nature,
and li'er laws will easily (olve all f,-emiiu
difficulties ; take the common butterfly for
; it: :.e, v.e ill iuiow, it is lirft an egg,
men ichryjalis, then a craw li'>gcaterpil!cr,
and then a gaudy winged butterfly. Is
there more difference between Inflrumen
tality paying off the French debt under the
of the 4th of Augtift 1:90, or Inftru
me itality pwrchafing the domeflic debt un
der the act of tlie 12th of Augiift ? Or be

pursued even tothe Phoenix, the rarest am

with Inflrumentality. It is at lealt afcer
tairied that when part of it'was lopped of

the President has been premature in dif

take another turii in the market to raifc

I'econd time in the cause of France, wh'icl
he thinks toft' much ia favour of the peoplt
to be much ifrfavdur of himfe'lf ; it is fait
too that the Secretary is apprehenflve tht
next congress (wh'iGi is known to be crnn
pofed of a set of thick-headed fellows) wil
believe he was really in eainelt when he
reported to the lair (w 110 nnderftood lome
thing of their b:if;nef.) that this inftrnmen
tality grew solely out of tile act of the 1 211
of August, and the President is. really ac
cused of a little fmaltering of Jacobifiifni.

It would be bad now for America, if the
l'refidert and Secretary II oultl spoil a'.l, by
a little immaterial difference of opinion

(a) The Secretary in fabricating apolo

from Holland, makes the following afler
tion f " I fell uiyl'elf the more at liberty
to do it, because it did not interfere with

Here is but one definite object to which
the foreign money was to be txclulively
applied, nothing is said at this time of di

Dite Ihe com it of the trahfajtliili ivitt

(c) The Secretary, in reasoning to
hat the foreign fund as the imlrument
>f purchases, made with domestic refour
:es, comes to the folbowing sage conclu
ioil : " But wheil if is cdnfidered, far the
eafons which have been fiatcd, and which"

upply to current d/m'andsâlt will follow
hat the whole 1 or 'nearly the whole of the
jurchafes which were made previous to'
July 1792, were made by the means or in
trumerttalrty of the foreign funtl."
It Ihoiild be recollected that Hot one far
thing of the foreign mo.tey found its way
:sto tiit Ti'esfury, 'till Augufl 1791, and
that the purchases commenced proioui to
December 1790.

A correspondent begs leave to qneryâl:
it not a difgraceful bufiiefs fur Americai
revenue cutters to be employed in bring
ing challenges front the captains of Briti.i
iiiips of war, hovering off the coast, t<
French frigates happening to be in oui
ports ; and whether any mail of prudenc<
commanding a cutter, would not rejeil
with disdain the office of bringing the (ill;
challenge of an envenomed ruffian to ;
friend and ally ?
By a gentlemen in ij days from Ofwe.
f>o, we are favored wicn the following in
t.'lligcnce : â
Thai the co'mrtiflioners appointed tc
treat with the Indians after being detainâ 
ed some weeks at Niagara for want ol
proper court credentials from the execu
tive of the United State?, h d py needed ir
company with a number of Bi ftilh officer.'
to Saudt.llty, the place appointed for th;
treaty. Soon after their commencing or
the business of their million, a runner arri
ved from the Ohio with information tflai
GÂ«n. Wayne was moving forward wit!
his army to Sandulkyâat which the Indi
ans appeared to be gre.itly exasperated.
threatened the commiif oners, and in fhori
in tilted 011 removing to Niagara to com
plete the treaty ; with which the com
initlioners, from personal fafety. though
proper to comply. Here the buiinefs wa:
again interrupted by the arrival oi form
chiefs oil the part of iiie Onandago, Maf
ft-flinger, and Cocknewager nations, whe
infilled on returning to Sandiifkyâwhich
being agreed on, their counter-march was
to commence the day our informant lefi
Ofwego. He adds, tlrat Gov. Sinicoev. a:
to accompany the comniiflroners.
At a meeting of a number of merchant!
in Bolton 011 the 22d of July, several vote:
were puffed, declaratory of the neutralitj
of the United States in the |'relent war be
tween the European powers, me obliga
tion on Americans to oDferve exifling trea
ties, and to bring to condign punilhmen
any citizen of these Hates concerned in fit
ting out privateers, &c.âThe authority
and motives of this meeting are quelliont't
in another Bolton paper ; and the wholÂ«
represented as a pompous parade to en
force a purpose for which the proclamati
on of the Prelident is fully competent', ii
practicable. It is hinted also that this
meeting has aflturied to itfelf the function:
of certain persons, well known in Bolton
tailed Jeleci men.
11 is remarkable (fays a correspondent,
that monarchy in all countries is of a re"
clul'e spirit. The emperor of Mogulllan
in Alia, only Ihews himfelf to his subjects
once a year : The king of once
every seven years. The ancient Mexican
kings in America (hewed themfelvcs once
a week : and the present kings of Ebo and
Angola, in Guinea, do the fame thing
t'jtfice a month. When wooden idols and
gi' iven images occupied the place of kings,
they were brought out at certain periods
of time and exhibited to the multitude,
who then returned well ple.ifed to their
dry bread and servitude. Such has been
the strange tafli Of defpotifin in all ages,
that counts more for itfelf upon affeiting
the people with ideas of diftai-it awe and
reverential terror, than by habits of cour
tesy and affability. Indeed it is in the na
ture of man tâ¢ eftecm highly what he is
but imperfectly acquainted with, and upon
this principle it is that kings.
Like other Jecrets men adore.
Are hid to be rever'd the more.
We hear the TENTH of AUGUST,
will be celebrated this year in the United
State*-, by â¢ all true friends of France ; that
bein;; the real birth-day of rc|Vublican li
berty to our Gallic allies., and uot the 14th

reformation from defpotilin.
a inong the names of tliofe, against whom
b'.li of indictment have been found, for
fitting out vtflels of war in this port, it is
laughable enough te find some wtio were
conl'picuous among the addressers ot the

(Signed) " BOMPARD."
Captain Commandant of the l'Aaibufcade
Captain Bompard, having received in
ahfwer to the letter, refolded how
ever, not to dil'appoint the martial ai'doui
oi Captain Courtney, and therefore l'ailee
from New York, as above mentioned, tt
wait upwir him.
We hear lorn Shrewfoury that abwnt 5
o'clock on Thursday morning lad, the fri
gate i'Ambnicade was leen engaging with
the Boflon frigate otf that place. Aftei
keeping it up from two to three hours, the
Bolton Had her foremalt and fore top mail
ihot away j in' consequence of which fee
made what fail ihe could and flood off tc
sea. The Ainbilfcade, tho' fomewhai
damaged iu h'tr (lauding rigging, and final]
Ipars, ilood alter her,and w lien out of fighl
of land, they were again heard engaging.
The final result was not known when this
paper went to press.
Authentic particulars reluive to the en
gagement between the Amoufcade ana
Bujlun Frigatesâ-from a Utter datec
Shrezjbtiry, Aug. t.
"At five in the morning, the two fri
gates hove in light directly ulf Shrewsbury,
3 leagues from-lie land. At three quar
ters pall live they began to engage, and the
action continued,with intervals of manoeu
vring, pretty brilk till seven, the Ambus
cade having much the advantage of the
wind. The action then became more
sharp, and continued so some time, wher
the Ambuscade appeared much in confu
fion, from tho British frigate raking hei
conliderably. At thisjiin&ure a (hot irofr
the Ambulcade carried away ths Bolton':
main topmafl, which falling overboard th<
wreck appeared to embarrass them verj
much, The snips then retired 5 fmatl dif
tance from cach other, as by mutnal con
sent. In one quarter of an hour the Bos
ton bore away to the louthward, and the
Ambuscade aiter her, till they wery near
ly out of fighr. The Boflon was under
the fail she could set, -irid the French fri
gate also, but her main topfaii only hall
mail high, probably from the mall being
injured, ihe Britifli frigates main top
mall appeared to be carried away very
near the cap. The Boflou's bearing away
as Ihe did, was no doubt with a design to
refit, which it was thought he might do by
one o'clock, when probably the engage
ment was resumed. From all appearance
it was thought the BritiQi frigate would

We are frequently told by the arifto'-

ot Liberty which appears to be revived in
our country, at the present moment, is the
offspring ot a fixed enmity to the general
government ;and thatnonebut antifcdtral
ijts are anxious about the faithful cliichargt
of our obligations to France. â The molt
avowed and inveterate enemies of the

severe satire against it. What! are the

DIALOGUE between the three cele
brated traitors Arnold,La Favetie, and
Dumourier,âfrom Lc Courier de U
Lune, a French paper of July 12.
/Irnold. You deceive yourfelf, Marquis,
as well as me ; and your fault comforts me.
Did you expedl tÂ« be happy in betraying
your nation ?
Marquis Not at all ; I never meant to
betray my country ; but I had taken an
oath to which I would remain faithful.
Dumourier. Gentlemen, speak not o!
treason, that is not the proper term ; as I
am of the triumvirate, I make use of my
right, and tell you, that you had nothing
in view but your own interest. Of what
importance to a warrior is the name of the
sovereign he serves ; he fliould never un
(heath his sword, 'till the lalt of the of
fertrs has pulled out his purse, and mea
sured his fa-vices Â»o the weight of the
go'd it contains.
La Fayeite Though in a degree culpa
ble, those principles were never mine ;
but I could never retift the tears ot madan
Elizabeth, the young prince and princess,
nd still much less the tender proofs oj
friendjhip I have repeatedly experienced ir
:he queen's arms. But, Arnold, what
ivas your reason ?
Arnold. I never had any ; I believe 1
was crazy; when I recoiled the tender as
Fe&ions of the Americans, the tears flou
from my eyes, and my bleeding heart
leaves in my mind but the tÂ»idhire oftht
unfortunate Andre, whom I cauied to be
massacred.
Dumourier. What a weak mind dor;
:bis man polh fs. Arnold! Arnold ! yot
tay that you have commanded ?
Arnold. Y ts, unfortunately, and bravt
foldters-
Dumourier. Who then caused you tc
abandon your country ?
Arnold. Alas 1 the loss of good sense,
lie flattt rv and promiles of the Britif!
:ourt, the intrigue of several members oi
;he Conprefs,that I never had the ftrengtl
:o unmalk, so certain I was then of refili
ng their perfidy.
La Fayette. Your fate, Arnold, is to bt
pitted ; but mineâfincc I quitted my ar
my I believe an infÂ»rn 1 power attends
me every where. Those brave toldrers,
ivho loved tne so much, who cariied tnt
n triumph 011 their shoulders to the fron
-iers of the en my ; that brave nation,
ivhich had for me such unbounded affec
:ion, which would have ere&ed altars foi
me, and which now detests me, are to m(
it present a spring of all evils. Alas !
lupport me ; 1 fink under the weight o:
my griefs.
Dumourier. Young warrior, your deli
racy betrays your chara&er; and I forgive
you on account of your youth ; but you
Arnold! for (hame! don't you know
-hat warriors, like Us, rrfque all with thcii
leeks ? recoiled! that it is neceflary for u:
:o fubrnit to our fate with cduragr, arte
:vtr to calculate oil it before hand in eafc
if misfortune. For my part # I gave goor
ecurity to a bad efoance on the bank ol
London. The (ladtholder, prince Co
>ourg and Mr. Pitt, did so much, and of.
et ed so much, that my warlike log it
:ould not refill their powerful yellow ar
guments.
La Fayette. If my nation would take
ny life for the pledge of my repentance,
f would at lead die happy.
Arnold. IfArrterica but alas!
vho would have any any thing to do with
o consummate a traitor.âHad I perished
tt the battle of Saratoga, or at Qiiebec,
ny memory would have been ever grateful
:ot!ie Americana, and I llvould have been
:ternally celebrated in the oratiitos songs,

but let money be made the theme, and the
congenial foul of sympathy inftantlv a
wakens from its numbersâand becomes
eloquent on a theme whkh it finds per
feftly conijnant to its ideas and nature.
2. Poetry may be reckoned a declining
m. Ever iincc the ages of fable have dif
appeared it has ! een gradually losing
'round, and as the world advances towards
Jniverfal republicanif.a the ideas of man
nd become prosaic. Even in monarchies
poetry is now at a low ebb and not even
t"ic splendid favours of nobility, or the
countenance of the monarch, can iufpire
trains beyond tame mediocrity. Pociical
panegyrills are at present every win re des
pised, and in proportion as principles su
persede attachment to men, they will be
jomc more ai.d more detelled. Real po
ttry> however, will one day have its refur
cction; buc its profeffors will no longer
be court sycophants, or miserable depen
dents upon what are called tf c great
-1 lie republican virtues will be their great
eft theme, and the promotion of gooJ
will, peace, and friendA ip among mankind
their mainobjeft, instead of singing the
bloody battles, and reheaifing the military
praises of crown 'd murderers. It may be
"bfeived, that poetiy is r.ot to the genetal
tafle of Americans. They have too much
cool refle&ion to be amtifed bv trifles, t!,e
monotony of metre, and the' jingling of
rhymer-. Every po.t must look with a
jealous eye oil the diversions of the circus ;
and it was with some pain- I have obser
ved that the fineft morality and molt ele

frequently for the equestrian en
