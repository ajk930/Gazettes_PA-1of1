ObJervatiOns on a Ch-iife in " the late Ad. for
the fak of vacant lands within the Com
monwealth of Penn/ylvaniti."
The CLAUSE,
oec. 4. " r ]P HERE shall be granted to
I him [the applicant] a
f arrant for any quantity of land within
le said limits, not exceeding 400 acres."
Is it the meaning that each warrant
shall contain but 400 acres ; or that each
applicant shall take but 400 acres ; that is,
one warrant and no more ?
The officers of the land-office fay, that
by the advice they have taken, they are
authorized to grant only 400 acres to any
one person. I fay, the words are rcilric
tive of the quantity of land in each war
rant, and not of the quantity grantable to
anyone person by more than one war
rant.
There is good reason to redrift the
quantity of each warrant, not only as fe
curing reasonable fees to the office to an
swer die expences of the commonwealth in
supporting offices for these sales ; but al
so as ascertaining reasonable bounds Tor a
plantation, within which by ihe terms of
the a<ft a fettlemcnt mud be made in a cer
tain time, under forfeiture of title Lut
no good reason can be given to redriifi the
purchasers to4oo acres each.
The faÂ£t is, the commonwealth could
have had in view but three obje&s, the
disposal of the lands, the improvement of
the country, and the accommodation of
the poorer emigrants.
The land is belt disposed, by letting all
men purchase what they chufe. Ihe im
provement is bed promoted by letting all
men improve and fettle as many traÂ£ts as
they think proper. The poorer emigrant
is bed served by giving land to those who
are bed able to afuft him to improve nnd
fettle. Where reason, and public intered,
and convenience favour the conftruftion
of a law, in cases dubious, let that pre
vail.
Had it been the intention of the legis
lature to preclude an appropriation of more
than 400 acres by any one person, fin ely
the prohibition would have been more dif
tinft and certain. By the adt of April,
1784, for the disposal of lands within the
purchase of 1 768, it is provided that ' the
quantity of land granted to one per
son shall not excced 400 acres." Here
the words are clear, yet it is notoiious,
and was well known to every officer of
crovernment and to the members of the
legislature who had any thing to do with
land in tin's purchase, that the clause was
evaded, by the fame person taking out sev
eral warrants for his own use in real or fic
titious names ; and the evasion in consci
ence was judifiable, because the law in this
particular was unjust, many perfor.s having
by themselves and others made improve
incuts or made purchases of improve
ments which they would wish to appropri
ate and secure by warrants.
But the legislature knowing these eva
lions why not, at lead in the unimproved
land, make use of the words as flrong as
in the former cafe , and express themselves
(in so clear a manner that the board of
office need not doubt, and consult the opi
nion of the governor's secretary, or attor
ney general on the subject ?
If it is the meaning of the law that no
individual shall appropriate more than
one warrant, an evasion by ulhu a fictitious
name, or the real name of a person for the
use of onewho has already had his quanti
ty, mud not only, if the fact can be eda
blifhed, avoid the warrant, but, as a fraud
upon the public, be a misdemeanor and
punishable with fine and imprisonment.
This is a high consequence to found on
inch inexplicit words as, according to the
whom 1 differ, they mud be considered.
It is not from any abllraft motive of
canvafling a law point that 1 make these

observation"!, but I feel what 1 think a
grievance from the opinion given. Having
several unfatisfied warrants on which by
this ast I am entitled to have new war
rants, I am told at the land-office that but
one can be granted, which is in effcft
that but one warrant can be (atisfied.
This T take to be by no means within the
intention of the law.

Extracts from French papers, printed at Pa

Rome, April 18th "Some days ago, his
liolinefs the Pope summoned a convoca
tion of the French (emigrant) ecclefiaflics
rtliding in this city, particularly those of
the church of St. Louis. At this con
vocation the Abbe Goulard addressed his
holiness, in the name of his brethren, as
follows : â "Your liolinefs fees at his feet

various (lations have openly confefied theii

goodnels,has reserved to 113 a Pontiff, who
in the mod stormy times, has eter set an
example of that serenity and strength oi
mind, which virtue alone can giveâa
pontiff, whose example ought to enlight

we, and others of your faithful brethren
can only forget those who have unfor

Tratit us yourn/o/MWbenediftion, which

'The reception given by his ho'inefs the
Pope to the difaffefted French clergy, the
favour and succour he has shown iliem,
is scarcely more than moderately indem
nifying them for the critical situation into
which they have plunged themselves.â
Phcie is scarcely any body here, how
ever, who is not convinced, that the reli
gious affairs of France would have been
ong before this time perfectly conipromi
fed, if the Pope, instead of keeping an ob
dinate silence, had deigned to ast the me
diator and propose terms of accommodati
an. But his perfidious advisers have per
suaded him that the opposition of the
ivhole body of the clergy would be the
lure means of effecting a counter revoluti
31), and the only means of prefei ving the
pierogatives of the court of Rome. In
ronfequence of this system the Pope has
left the French clergy to chufe the dis
agreeable alternative of perfc-cution or
Ichifm. In other refpefts, his fyflern is
neither conformable to found policy or
the principles of religionâhi (lory i.-.form.i
lis that whenever a government compels
the people to embrace what are called or
thod x p inciples, or to renounce the rights
t>f freemen, they do not heiita t e to secede
to the religion of nature, which informs
them that mankind did not come into thi.
world to be flivesâPerfecutions against
:he French ire increasing here every day.
The (late S;:oretary itTned an edidl some
.veeks ago to all inn-holders, and keepers
if furnifhed lodgings, to deliver ir, with
neighs d :y3, the nqmes of all Frenchmen
efiding in Rome. The government is
low resolved to banish them (the revoluii
jnifts) from the country ; and it will not
t>e fate for them to be found here after the
irfl. of May.âThe governors of the fron
ier-towns of the ecclefiailical territories
have also received orders not to fufier any
Frenchman to pass without a positive writ
ten permit from the court. In confe
rence of this order, three carriages, full
t>f French, have been obliged to return to
Viterbo. Such treatment, as much con
trary to the rights of nations as to chrifti
charity, is not likely to conciliate the
-ninds of the French nation to the court
jf Rome.âAs to other matters, we are
aught to have no doubt of the success of
i counter revolution. Great rejoicings
took place when news c.ime that the Ja
ttobin clubs had the ascendancy at Paris,
hat there were fattions and divilions in
he aO'emblv, and troubles in the provinc
es . We are also convinced, that if France
.vere but tolerably united in sentiment,
;he combined powers would never dare to
ittack her ; but by being in a flute of a
larchy, that fbe will destroy herfelf and
become the easy prey of foreigners, who
ivill find i' their interest to re-establish the
;lergy in all their rights* pofTcflions, privi
!eges, and prerogatives, If this view of
France be jufl, their hopes will piobably
be gratified. It is thought to be just in
Rome, as well us in many other places oi
Europe, because the ilate of the country
s onlyjudged of by the ariflocratical newf
pf.pert., with which we are supplied to pro
ufion. As we are fute they circulate
reely in France, they are thought worthy
jf credit ; and it is supposed that the Na
ional Afi'embly have not the power to pu
ii(h those people who openly preach up re
folt from, and contempt of all legal autho
â ity. We cannot conceive why the friends
jf liberty give their enemies so many op
sortunities to injure their cause. They
lepend too much on impartial jutlice, no!
;onlidering that in a revolution, which hat
o struggle with so many prejudices, and
vith such a variety of jarring interells, it
s dangerous to reckon too much upon the
general principles of liberty "

Turin, April 25. " Notwit'uftanding
the pacific aiTuranccs given by this court,
in refpeft of the affairs of France, there is
every reason to mistrust its obfeure po

in completing the troops of the line, and
besides these the provincial regiments ara
arming. 1 hefe regiments form i:i tlia
whole an army of 15 or 16,000 men, ami
are so organized that the whole of them
may be coll.cdled in a few days. The gar

Considering the exhausted state of our trea

all these preparations may be solely meant

St Peterjburg. April 18. 'â  The grand
duke of RufTia seems to be progreflinjr ex
actly in the ftepsof his unfortunate father,
and uniefs the grand duchess fiiould poflefs
a heart replete with all the benign virtues,
he will one day experience the fate Â£>f Pe
ter the 3d. He himfelf expects it, anti
cipates it, and is therefore deeply cha
grined. He now keeps, in quality of mis
tress, madamo felle Nelidoff, one of the
maids of honour to the grand dutchefe, one
of the uglielt and most peevish creatures in
the world. Such qualifications are not
the most proper to foften the temper of a
prince, who is every day becoming more
and more gloomy, ferocious, and forbid
ding. He has no longer confidence in
anybody: the courtiers hate him; the
military, that are immediately under his
command, are difgulted with his Ariel at
tention to trifles and unrelenting severity ;
the guards despise him ; in one word, the
day that he mounts the throne, encl ess re
volutions will be the consequence, and will
no doubt put a period to the brilliant ca
reer, that has distinguished the reign of
Catharine. Such a prolpeft adds to the
chagrin of the grand duke. He is vexed
at his own infignificance ; lie is continual
ly quarreling with t'neemprefs, his mother,
and even goes so far as to threaten her.
His ill tifage of his consort, the grand
dutcheff, has occasioned a remondrance 0/1
her part to the empress. Touched at her
statement of ma'-teis, the empress cr.ufcd
the grand duke to come into the citv
trom his country residence. She then
held a convcrfation uith him, befitting a
mother and a sovereign ; but the duke re
plied to her neither like a son nor a fuh
jeÂ£t. He used arrogant language, in the
ilile of a man who is fully convinced of his
own importance, and badly supports his
own infignificance When he returned
to his chamber, all who came near hinÂ»
were sure to feel the e fFeÂ£ls of his chagrin.
He complained of being furrotinded with
spies and traitors ; and mentioned more
than once that people were around him
who were plotting to depose him as his fa
ther had been before him, but that, previ
ous to any such event taking pla-e hfi
would fend at lead a dozen pet i'ons to the
other world, whom he knew to be his ene
mies. He sent orders to madam Bcnken
dorff (the dutchefs's companion; to packup ai)d depart from R.uflia immediately,
and to mortify the dutchefs the more, he
sent after her two French gentlemen,
one who had acted as herleÂ£furer,the other
her drawing-master. He fufpeifed that
they both entertained French revolution
pr nciples, and had represented the Nati
onal Assembly affairs in a more favourable
light to the duchess than he wished (hould
be done.âHis children, however, enter
tain very different sentiments, and inter
est themselves much in the success of the
patriotic cause. Those who have the
care of their education are enlightened
chara&ers, and make it a point that no
thing (hall be concealed from the young
princes. It is highly probable therefore
that the riling family will one day be a
blessing to Rufiia; but this is at a distance,
and even this will be dearly bought, if the
grand duke i 3 to govern during the inte
rim, who both hates the French nation,
and is ur.iverfally hated. âAs I mentioned
before, there is no doubt but we are on the
verge of a revolution of great characters,
which will involve many others. The
grand duke is dreaded by theemprefs ; and
he, in his turn, is suspicious of her : and
the death of prince Potemkin has not ad
ded to the confidence he before reposed in
his mother. It is generally thought that
if his suspicious and diftruftful temper had
not banifned all those from about his per
son who were entitled to serve him, he
would have been already at the helm of
empire ; but the natural course of events,
in all probability may loon give him the
reins, without the commiflion of a crime to
obtain them. The health of the empress
is daily on the decline ; her whole frame is
bent forward, which much alarms the
courtiers, who dread nothing so much as
revolutions.
Marseilles, April 19. The true patriots
in Marseilles are a great majority of its in

NEWBURYPORT, July 18.
Several newspapers of the pad and pre

Perkins of this town being sent for to Phi

the coinage there. Mr. Perkins' abilities
111 thai line are fully adequate to such an
appointment, as the specimens he has exhi
bited in coining amply telfify. lotteadof
the former method of performing the bu
siness, he has invented a new machine,
which cuts the metal into such circular
pieces as are wanted, and givei the 1111-
preflion at the fame timeâits motion is ac
celerated by a balance-wheel, and more
than one third of the time and labor there
by saved. He has also conilruited another
machine, of his own invention, for milling
or lettering the edge, by which a boy can
mill iixty each minute. Were itfound ne
ceflary, he would apply fleam to perform
the mof't laborious part of the bufmefs. But
what is of more importance, and will be
found to be of more utility than all the fore
going, is, a check, which he ha< invented,
for discovering counterfeits. This is so
contrived, as that one eighth of a minute
is fufficient to determine, without thepoj/i
----htily of a liiiftake, whether a piece of mo
ney is genuine, or not; and any town or
merchant can be fupplied,atafma!lexpenfe,
with said check, and then reit allured that

The following little incident (from a
late French paper) will give some idea of
:he character of Francis 1 It, king of Hunga
-y and Bohemia.
" This morning the king, wrapped in an
jld riding coat, and a mean looking hat,
xemincog to the wheat market,to hear-with
lis own ears the complaints of the people,
:o observe the abuses of the government,
uid, if poflible, fall upon some method of
â¢emedying them. He was Â»n the mid-t of
:he crowd, when he happened to direct his
?ye towards a crowd ot people that were
lurrying to a public house, at a fi'iall dif
ance. He aihed, what was the matter ? and
.vas answered that three men were there
.vhohad been condemned to receive 50 lathes
:ach, for speaking difrefpeÂ£tfully of the me-
Tiory of tl e liteemperorLeopold. The king
sventinftantiy to :he public house, & desired
:o be admitted. The centinel refufed.
I'he king then made himfelf known, and
he doors were in a moment thrown open.
One of the men had already received ten
evere ladies ; he was then let down from
the poll to breathe awhile, for another flog*
jing. she king oblerving this, ordered them
to unbind the man that had been flagellated,
at the fame time advising him, in future, to
observe moderation when the character of
the late Emperor was the fubjett of his
conversation. He then represented to the
Colonel, who had arbitrarily infiifted this
punishment, the impropriety of so severe a
caltigation for so tnjling a fault. " I have
need of wen in my army (said he) and by
your treatment you make my fubjefb inva
lids ; you are difmilled therefore forever
from my service."
The English parliamentary debates put it
beyond a doubt that the face of the govern
ment {whatever may be the sentiments of
the people) is set against all innovations and
cOnttitutional reforms ; and therefore, as
far as prudential considerations will per
mit, the writings of Paine and the efforts ol
patriotic societies throughout the kingdom
will be discouraged and discountenanced.
t>n the 25th of May the master of the rolls
made a mot.on in theÃritifh House of Com
mons that" All humble address of thanks be
presented to hi: Majefty,exprellive of the at
tachment of the House to his person and
family, and their determination to exert
themfe'lves in opposing the wicked purposes
of the (editions writings aiming to destroy
the tranquility of the kingdom."âHe con
ceived (he (;i;d) that the writings alluded
to (Paine's Rights of Man, &c.) would
have been, when firftprinted, treated with
contempt by every man in the nation, and
conligned with the contempt they merited,
to oblivion ; but though they were treated
with contempt by the majority of the na
tion, it was notorious that there were so
cieties which had pre (Fed these seditious
writings on the public, and with industry
had distributed them throughout the coun
try ; and it %vas also known that corref
poudences had been held by those societies
with foreign clubs, for the purpose of dis
seminating the moil dangerous principles;
no one could fay that it was not the duty
of administration to come forward anil
exert themfelvesin the maintenance of the
tranquility ot the kingdom by endeavoring
to counteract: the poison of those publica
tions. The people were happy; why then were
they to be insulted by a recommendation of
the example of a neighbouring kingdom
lhat recommendation had however beet*
propagated in the mod dangerous way ; it*
had been held out to every description of
men, and had been difieminated in schools
and public seminaries ; it was then high
time for the interference of government to
prevent the evil that might ante.
A late Southern paper mentions, that a
violent fever rages in Charleston. It is laid
to be of a kind which the physicians are,
generally speaking, unacquainted withâ
and consequently in many instances, it baf
fles their endeavors to effect a cure. The
mortality is very alarming, as the patient
seldom lives more than three days from the
firft fymptoins of the disease.
The Island of Martinico, according to
letters from thence, has been for some time
part in a {fate of ferment. The planters
in general are of what are called the aris
tocratic party, who had influenced the
greater part of the land-forces in the forts,
barracks,&c. to revolt. In consequence
as their outrages, two 74 gun {hips of war
were warped opposite the forts and brovfght
:heir guns to bear thereon. This so inti
midated the troops in Fort Bourbon that
:hey sent in their acknowledgmentsâafter
bme further time, those in Fort Louis did
:he fame ; and the regiments from both
were sent on board a transport under pro
reclion of the two feveuty-fours. The 12th
rf June was the day appointed for their
"ailing for France, but it was not expected
:he vefi'els in which they were embarked
would leave the island before the 23d.
Port-au-Prince (fa)'s an authentic ac
count) has been for some time occupied and
governed by a rabble, without property,
honor, orhonefty, who have conftantfyop
pofed the decree of the National Aflembly,
giving the rights of active citizens to free
Negroes and Mulattoes ; to enforce this
decree, and to pave the way for restoring
order in the island, an expedition has been
recently undertaken, with two 74 gun
{hips, and several fmailer veflels, which left
St. Marks the 22d of June, and after expe
riencing a variety of difficulties, anchored
before Port-au-Prince on the 26th in the
evening. Instead of summoning the town
to an inflant furreuder, which it was tho't
by many would have been a decisive stroke,
the commander in chief of the expedition
entered into a parley with the insurgent
chief in the towj), which gave many crimi
nal characters an opportunity to escape.
On the sth of July the comm "ider of the
land forces 011 this expedition entered
Port-au-Prince at S in the morning, at the
head of several hundred volunteersâan
liour after, the 1 onnniflary entered with
the national troops that had been encamped
in the neighbourhood ; and, at about 10,
the army came in that had been aUembled
for a long time part at Croix <les Bouquets.
When these accounts left Hifpanioht, per
fect tranquility was not yet reltored in Port
au-Prince, every effort being made by the
disorderly inhabitants to seduce the crews,
and renew their lawleft practices. A few
Jays before the arrival of this expedition,
Pralots,the commander of a gang of merce
nary negroes, was to have attacked the
camp of Troubordet, and deltrov ail by fire
and sword in his way to Jactnel, where he
was alio to make an attemptâail avenues
to escape being cut oft, and every palYagei
previously guarded, he was obliged to re-l
main in Port-au-Prince, and was there'
seized.

On the Arifiocratical tendency of Chance-y Courts
[From a NiiV'York paper .J
One rhin;j enumerated by Congress as a griev
, ance, and as an infringement of our rights bj
the king and parliament of Great Britain, vva:
their depriving us, in many instances, of trial b>
jury, itr this particular, we are no better cfi
new, tha.Â« before . The fame aristocratic princi
ples ot the Biitiih government are interwover
in our government. In all controversy of com
mon Uw, jurie3 arc the sole judges of law anc
equity ; but of what value is their deufion, or
the privilege of trial bv a jury in civil cases,
when at* the option of either party, the decifior
of a jury can be removed into a court of chancery :
where the verdict of a jury of our peers, may be
revc rfed by the chancellor, and from his decifior
to a court of error ? This appears, to me a per
fect jargon, and a complicated piece of nonsense
If it be right and just, that a pcrfon llrall be com
pelled to jvive evidence against himfeJf, as is the
caCe in courts of chancery j why not the fam<
p-.adlicebe admitted in common law; if it b<
unjust to compel any person to evidence again <;
himfelf in common law procedure, why fuiierec
to be compelled in any court whatever ? I car
fee no valuable purpose it can be to have our law;
so complicated, unless it be, fir ft to multiply Jay
prcceedings, procrastinate and delay justice, mul
tiply cost, and give the aristocratic party ver;
great advantages over the commonalty. There,
fore, I am ot opinion, that the court of chancers
ought wholly to be abolished, as a glaring in
fiance ofopprefiion and partial admiriiftiation o
jultice, and openly calculated to maintain an ar
bitrary aristocratic influence and decifun of lav
over the commonilty. Jt may be insisted on
that as courts of chancery are open to the poor, 0:
middle forts of people, as weli as to the rich, it is
just j I answer, that the excefiive expence attend
ing chancery fuits,is an effectual bar to all, ex
cept those that have long purles $ therefore, ii
the plaintiff or defendant be in (lender circum
ffartce's, they had better lose the suit in coramor
law,than to pay a cost more, or as much as tht
matter in cjueition is worth : Bt'fides, in refpefi
ef what may be called a jury of our peers, I con
ceive it is to be men of the fame vicinage anc
inen of the like circumstances in life. Are chan
cellors men of the like conditions in life with
the poor or middletlafs of people ? I answer, no:
but;on the contrary they are the peers of thÂ«
great, and the opulent, if in decisions of law 3
is it likeiy if partiality fnould ever appear, to
have it i:i favour of commonalty ? The proba
bility is so small, that ic hardly admits of a
possibility uut if there is any, it is sure to be
in favour of their own class. But if all men
are born to equal rights in a community, why
two modes of Jaw-dtclfion : one fp r the rich,
and the other for a different clafj of men ?
This is one of the dregs of the Britilh ccn.iitu
tion, and ought to be obje&ea :o as nugatory,
mockery, and defraud j and if there be a contro
versy in common law and one of the party be of
the common branch, and the other be cf the
higher class, the jury ought to be composed of
each clafi cue half,, as near as be.
