Theintereflof the Northern and South
ern States forever ivfep arable,
IT seems to have been the design ol
nature in her formation and distribu
tion of that part of North America,
known by the name of the United States
that a mutual dependence ffiould take
place between the northern and south
ern inhabitants. The New-Englanc
states, naturally narrow, and their land;
ill general not very fertile or productive
will ever be under the necessity of keep
inga vast number of their people on the
watry element ; of this number the fiin
cries will occupy a conliderable ffi arc
The exportation of the manufacture:
and commodities of those four states will
engage another part ; but a large furplut
muftin a short time, I may even fay,
would be absolutely out of employ at
this instant, were it not for the carrying
trade of the southern states, by which 1
would be understood the states from
Maryland to Georgia, both inclusive.
An intimate union, founded upon the
broad basis of the carrying trade, may
continue durable as time, and the pre
sent constitution of things. That it will
ever be the interest of the southern states
to become their own carriers, does not
appear. Necessity alone obliges men
to live upon the ocean, and so little docs
that necessity exist in the Carohnas, that
there is at this time not more than one
or two masters of vessels belonging to
America, who are natives of thole states,
and absolutely no common ieamen.
Where mutual interest is the cement
of the people, an empire bids fair to be
lasting and haopy. Where there are
iealoufies and nvalfhips the tie of an
cient friendffiip soon becomes feeble,
and ambition presently finds means to
establish small independencies, ruinous
to the people, and finally rendering
them contemptible to larger and better
consolidated governments.
To strengthen the habits of lnter "
eourfe and connexion between the
northern and southern extremities ot
the American government, nothing leems
to be more wanting than a capital htuat
ed in the centre, which ffiall be the great
resort and emporium of the world, tc
which the inhabitants of the immenle
western regions shall find an easy acceis.
where the N.England-man, the Georgi
an or the Carolinian ffiall conhdertheni
fel'ves alike at home ; where the pro
duaions of all will be in demand ; and
which ffiall be the grand mart of Euro
pean and Asiatic commerce. Nov. 8.
Thoughts on the Theory of Government
as applicable to the new C'onilitution of France.
[Tranjlatcd from le Logographe, Journal Na
tional, Aug. EiS.]
THE constitution of France holds
forth to the nation, Liberty, Pro
perty, and, lastly, Security .-âAnd these
iritftimable blessings are still further se
cured to us by the spirit of that system
upoji which the constitution is founded.
There has been much dispute on the
nature of the government, which the
constitution has given us. It is monar
chical (fay some) âIt is, in reality, re
publican, fay others. They, who have
no idea but of these two species of go
vernment, pretend that it is mixed, 01
partakes equally cf the republican and
monarchical forms.âBut, in reality,
the government which i' ranee is now
upon the point of eftabliffiing, appear;
rather to participate equally oi three
modes of domination: and, in faÂ£t.
t here are but three original elementary
kinds of government in the world :
The.manarckical, the abuie of which
leads to defpotiim â
The ariflorratical,, the abufc of which
i;nds to oligarchy* or when the variou;
powers of government are in the hand;
of a few : and, lastly, the democratic
â 'orm of government, the abuse of whicl
is called anarchy.
By PHILIP FRENEAU.
T HURSDAY, November 10, 1791.
If we examine accurately, we shall
find, throughout the world, that the
above three kinds of domination (viz.
supreme power in the hands of one man,
of many, or of all) are, in pra&ice, either
wholly separate, or jumbled together.
But abuses inevitably grow into them
all, when there is not a certain fpecific
principle to qualify them ; or when
the mere blending of them into one mass
is considered as a fufficient check to
the abuses of each, simply considered.
The great problem, then, to be resol
ved, is, whether, in creating a consti
tution, it be possible so to combine and
melt down the three simple modes of
government, that from the whole there
(hall result a perfect harmonious sys
tem ; as from the assemblage of certain
original founds, proceeds a har
mony, in mufifc.
This is precisely what our lcgiflators
have done : they have divided and fub
dividcd the sovereign power really re
siding in the people ; but yet in such a
manner, as to leave it complete in prac- j
tice.
It is a truth, generally known, that a
single agent is requisite for a prompt'
execution of the laws ; and that the|
laws themselves (to be good and faluta- !
ry) should be the result of thedifcuf-j
fions and reflections of a small number
of enlightened men ; the choice of
which men will be the more or less va
luable in proportion as it arises from
the votes of a greater or smaller number
of citizens, who shall have freely con
curred in the appointments.
Upon these principles, we shall fee
every department of public business de
legated to him who is most equal to its
duties. It will lie upon the whole bo
!dy of the people to clioofe their legit
! lators ; the legislators will constitute
the national assembly of France (elected
by the public voice) which will form
exattly that kind of elective aristocracy,
proposed by Rousseau, and which he
held up as the most perfett system of
government âAdded to these, is an he
reditary throne, occupied by a special
agent, the supreme head of the nation,
who holding the reins of regal power
i under the responsibility of his ministers,
â  j will ensure the most rapid and perfett
; execution of the laws of the empire.
1! Such a system of government leaves
- 1 nothing further in expectation. It is
-1 able in itfelf completely to maintain the
1 ! legislative and executive branches in a
_ I perfett equilibrium. This alone em
braces that assemblage of various pow
ers, the aggregate of which is nothing
else than nationalfovereignty fat in aÃion.
> It mull not be imagined, that previ
ous to the formation of any body of
!- people into a state of society, or before
the constitution of that society was
s finally established, that every individu
al poffeffed within himfelf some small
e share of that sovereignty or plenitude
- of power, which the great locial bodies
n are wont to exercise. Such a species
I. of sovereignty does not simply conlift
e in the right of governing one's felf, it
e likewise includes the right of governing
r- others. Now, this last right, previous
e- to the casual formation of society, be
e longed to no one. The species of fo
>- vereignty that is founded in the social
>r compact, cannot be coniidercd a fepa
d rate, particular right ; or a private
\f, possession of individuals ; on the con
w crary, it is general property, indiviiible
rs and'common, no part of which did ex
;e ift before the existence of society itfelf,
Â±, and which the people associated cannot
ry claim or exercise, but in common.
From an inattention to these ideas,
:h it has frequently happened, that a small
number of individuals, are frequently
;h {tiled in their petitions, members oj tht
us sovereign ; and that others have wiflied
ds I to annihilate the unity of a vionarchua.
:ic ! head in the constitution, in order thai
ch I the two othei powers might pcif>_ti.l\
[balanceeach other.
The mifunderltanding of these princi
ples has been one great cause of various
governments, eretted, in appearance, on
the most solid foundations, falling into
confufion and ruin.
Unfortunately, they neglected to es
tablish this power of supremacy, in one
person, as a part of their constitution,
and infringed that great law of nature,
which has ordained that the three
branches of government fhouldexift to
gether, to make a complete whole.
Wherever this omiflion has been fuffer
cd, it has been the conllant effort of the
people to restore it; and if England has
preserved a more perfett constitution
than other nations, it is because she has
espoused at all times this great element
ary principle of government.
Let us never admit any alterations, if
we can pollibly prevent them, into this
firftadtof our renovated government [the
onjiitutional code] which is founded upon
lie will of twenty-five millions of peo
ple. Let this precious treasure be tranf-
Tiitted from generation to generation in
all its purity, and may it descend, with
the bleflings of the people to bur latest
Tofterity ! They will have rcafon to ho
nor the memory of those men of genius
md Knowledge, who have established
he rights of a great nation, upon the
no ft benevolent laws, and who by their
wisdom and moderation have prevent
sd that effufion of human blood, which
i blind, stupid love of country has hi
therto encouraged among the different
nations of the world.

[ The following ideas on Ret Ã¼blican Govern
merits are translated from a late Frenci
paper J]
It is only by flow degrees that empire:
advance to maturity; whereas, theii
fall is sudden and precipitate. For feai
of something like this being the lot oi
I'ranee, let us turn a deaf ear to thoft
innovators, who in opposition to the
decrees of the National* AlTembly, art
continually preaching up to i;s the su
perior excellence of republican govern
ment..
If France lay inclosed in *a valley
surrounded by lofty and impalfabk
mountains, and accessible only by one
entrance, so as to have but one spot o:
territory to defend ; in that cafe, per
haps, a republican form might be the
most luitable to her circumstances ; bul
other means are necefi'ary to goverr
twenty-five millions of men, in a coun
try every where open .to the incursion:
offtrangers, and comprising within it
felf every ipecies of corruption. A
country habituated to luxury, 'where
wealth is unequally divided, is verv
different from one where the equality
of the citizens is founded upon the
equality of fortunes.
England and Ireland might become
republics witho it experiencing the fame
dangers as we should, because, notwith
standing the Unequal participation ol
property among the inhabitants of these
countries, they do not lie exposed, like
trance, to foreign invafiQn and sudden
eruptions. The people, too, having
preferred and enjoyed their liberties
for a long time, have acquired such a
hubit oi good order, that the conftilu
tions of boththfife islands might afTume
a republican form, without any consi
derable shock, from such a revolution,
In fatl, the Englilh and Iriill house oi
commons-have to this day preserved the
republican spirit, notwithstanding thcii
supposed tendency to aristocracy.
It is not the lame with France, fh<
having made a sudden transition fron
the most rigorous oppression to the rnof
absolute freedom, without any interme
diate marked gradations to prepare th<
French for imbibing' a true repuWicai
spirit.
PARIS, August 30.
The meeting of the English Parlia
ment is prorogued to the third of No
vember. The King, in the Court Ga
zette of the has revoked the ordei
offering a bounty for volunteer feamer
in the fleet ; which was to have beeH ir
forcetill August 3 1 It. but was renderec
void on the 20th ; the day the revoca
tion was published.
It is much doubted whether the pa
cific intentions of the Britilh Court an
sincere ; not in regard to the -Ruffian:
(for there is an end to that business) bu
towards some neighbours that the Bri
tifh Ministry view with rather an un
friendly eye. Every thing, in Ihort
announces, hostile attempts upon theii
old natural enemy on thisjWe of the chan
nd\ of whose present apparent weaknef
the Minister wishes to take advantage
There are suspicions that the fleet wil
r.ot be entirely laid up, but kept ii
forne fort of readiness, in cafe of fom<
favourable event, to reap the fruits o
court intrigue that have been carryiiii
on some time with a deal of art as wel
aspaiience. Ever since the nation ha
been acquainted with the result of th<
negociations withÃuffia, all the minis
terial papers are constantly trumpeting
into the ears of the public, the diftrerf
ed situation of France. The Oracle
in particular, after having laid a quan
turn fijicit of incense under the nofi
of Mr. Pitt, by formally returning hin
thanks for restoring the peace of Eu
rope, and flopping short, with a daft
of his pen, the Ruffian army that wen
marching to lay Constantinople in ashes
gravely remarks, that " the period i
now arrived, for the powers of Europi
to form a union against France." Tin
London Gazette is a little more modefiâ
That paper hints to us, that the fleet
instead of laying still, might as well b<
employed " in redrtffaig the affairs o
France." In fact, the generality o
their pamphlets and public papers mak<
the lame apologies for the convcntior
of Petei fburg, and contain nearly th(
fame insinuations against this country
The few opposition papers that ate ftii
in reprobate severely th(
measures of Mr. Pitt, but at the faint
time very feebly plead the cause of th<
Frenoh nation. We observe, with pain
that the Englilh in general, cannot for
get the American revolution ; the re
membrance of vi hich keeps alive a fe
cret hatred against the French ; as ii
that revolution, which has proved oi
luch immense benefit to mankind, anc
foglorious to the Americans themselves
did not originate in the Court of St
James s and from a corrupted majority
in the British House of Commons, ra
ther than from any intrigues of the
Court of Versailles. The French Mi
niftcrs, under the old government, it ii
well known, acted independent of anc
even in defpiteof the will of the peo
pie ; and if they assisted the Americans
it was, perhaps, because they could no
forget the speeches of the implacabli
Farl of C hatham, with whom the Delen
da Carthago was always a favorite sen
timent when applicable to the annihila
tion of France.
LONDON, September 4.
Every true Engliftiman ought to def
pile the coudua of the Oxford gradu
ates, in their fulfomc piece of adulatior
lent to Mr. Burke, for his endeavorins
to lupport church government at a time
when the ill effects of ft are ablbluteh
become proverbial. Gentlemen of edu
cation, and who pretend to be the Light
"f the world, ought not to appear in vin
dication of the plurality of livings anc
tliereby starving the poor curates, whe
are the chief laborers. If this is the
part they mean to ast, they can hardh
be coniiaered farthing candles. If o ui
church policy is such, that the ftatt
IYOUI tu mble to pieces by the least al
deration of it, let us hear the tncfis de
fended by argument manfully, and noi
fkuik behind the stale and degradec
term, innovation. Ihe glor:ous re
formation which has been effected ir.
:his kingdom, would have never exiftec
in Britain had our reformers been al
iiurkitesj or had they boggled at the
word innovation. The time, however
it least in other countries, seems to bt
approaching, when justice and e<juit\
muff take place of intrigue and elefyor
influence.
In relation to the above, the following
letter from Temelwaer (a town of Hun
gary on the Turkish frontier) may b(
worth notice, elpecially as it seems tt
include the idea that, enlightened as we
suppose ourfclves in England, a rude ant
barbarous people mull still throw furthe
tight to enable us to comply with th<
dictates of common honesty and com
mon justice. " The Corigrefs aflemblec
here (fays the letter) among fnanyothei
rfefel institutions worthy the adoption
)f all civilised nations, have decreed.
:hat an equalization of the revenues o
the church fliall take place, and that the
biiliops shall be obliged to pay a certain
proportion of their wealth, towards the
decent maintenance of the inferior cler
gy, who have hitherto performed the
duties of then profeffion in penury anc
rags, while the lazy, the indolent; anc
rapacious prelates, their superiors, have
been wallowing in luxury."
Until lately, it was the glory of the
Engliih nation to defend itfelf, and on
ly ast offenfively, when injured or in
lulted: our recent conduct of a contra
ry nature, in relpeft to Ruflia, it is te
be feared, has alienated the hearts oi
that nation from us. During two cen
turies our trade, with Ruflia has been an
abject of peeuliar national solicitude.
but by the proceedings of the season just
past, it would seem that the miniftet* nc
longer thinks the Ruffian trade an ob
ject worth preserving. By his ftrangc
perversion of ideas we are transferrins
the trade of Ruflia into the hands o
the French, and that of Thome anc
Dantzic into the hands of the Pruffiar
despot. As to hostilities with Ruflia.
the profpeft of any thing of that kind
is now over ; but, as every rational 01

UTON MODERN NOVELS.
\_From a late London Review.]
WHEN a manufa&ure has been
carried on long enough for the
workmen to obtain a general proficien
cy, the uniformity of the fluffs will,
render it difficult to decide on the pre
ference of one piece beyond another.
From a reason analogous to this, it is,
-hat altho' the greater part of modern
novels may exhibit nothing to shock
sur feelings, neither do they attract
my particular attention, either as to
materials or execution.
Two of the earliest fabricators of this
pecies of goods, the modern novel,
were Daniel de Foe, and Elizabeth
Haywood ; the success of Pamela may
be said to have brought it into fafhion ;
and the progress has not been less rapict
than the extentipn of the use of tea. to
which a novel is almofl as general an
attendant, as the bread and butter,
While we are on this fubjegt, it is
ilfo to be noted, that nothing is more
:ommon than to find hair powder lodg
:d between the leaves of a novel
which evinces the corresponding at
tention paid to the inside as well as to
:o outside of a modern head. When an
art becomes general, then is the time

ceitain in its operation, so long as not

Receipt for Vamping up Novels.
Go to Middle Row, Holborn, where,
lince mankind have discovered that
their own hair is fufficiently capable of
distortion, the fellers of old
wigs have given place to the dealers in
cait off books? there, on the bulks,
from among the classes of a groat or fix
pence per volume, buy an old forgotten
novel, the older the better: give new
names to the personages and places, re
form the dates, moderntze such circum
(tances as may happen to be antiquated,
and, if necelfdry, touch up the ffyle a
little with a few of those cant words
and phrases that may be in faihion at the

in , th f c v mar S m Â°f the printed book, with
\ l t , ro r ub f e of tranferibing the

Jookieller for Tale, for then you mud

1 o a pubhfher there are many advan
ces attending this mode of proceed
ing ; and the laving of copy money is

wo or three volumes, that could not be
purchaicd under four or five guineas
-nay be thus new vamped from an old
ane by acompofitor who dabbles a little
with his pen for perhaps half a eui
iea; and if the alterations be fkillfully
performed they will confound the judZ
tient so that neither author nor book
eller knowing his own book again a
rofecut'on for copy-right need lot be

The moll recent advices f -om Cape-Francois
mention that the Droit D'Aubaine (Kings alien
duty upon foreigners) has been abolilhed by the
AtTembly General of the Idand, upon a repre
sentation from the American merchants.
The fame accounts fay that immense quanti
ties of flour from this Continent are flored at
the Cape for winch there had been very little
demand several weeks pad. Price current from
four and an half to five and one quarter dollars
per barrel for the bed fuperfine.
A summary of other material intelligence by
the lad arrival from the Cape, to OMobc r 6, is
as follows : The two Negro Camps of Dagoult
and Gallifat are taken, without any lossâThe
Cane Army, confiding of Whites and free MÂ«-
lattoes, were p'epanng to attack I.'Acul and
Li'nbe âand a detachment setting out to Ge
naives, to prevent any luither infurreflions in
the neighbourhood of St. Marks. âNo troops
had arrived to the afli dance of the government,
from any quarter,âand the Engliflilhips of war
from Jamaica were unable to etfe&.any thing.
Several circumdances bad concurred to prove,
that the Spaniards of Cuba, and Spanilh Hif
panioia were at ihe bottom of the infurreffion,
and had furnilhed the Negroes with considerable
quantities of cannon, powder and other military
{tores.âln the Camp of Gallifat, after the cap
ture, were lound many valuable edefts, provi
sions, fix pieces of cannon, and a number of pa
pers proving that the Spaniards had hitherto
fupphed the Negroes with the means ofhodihty.
In general, when the lad velfels left the Cape,
matters were putting on a more favorable afpetl
than heretofore, the revolted Negroes having
begun to fall fholt of provisions and Stores, and
either furrenderirfg to the Whites or retreating
into inaccessible monriTains. After the General
AiJcmbly had certain pioo r s of an intercourle
between the Negioes and Spaniards, an embargo
was laid upon all th â  Spanish vellels in the ports
of French Hifpmiola to prevent, as much as pos
sible, their supplying the Negroes with any mote
{lores.
Exiraft of a letter from St. Mary's River (Geor

" Since peace has beefi re-edabli{hed with
the Creek Indians, this pait of the date of Geor

purchase lands in this quarter, which are for the

delightful climates of the known world. We have
already made some progress in building a town
about fix leagues up the river St. Mary's, which
from the natural advantages of that river and a
variety of other circumdances, bids fair in time
to be a flourifhing and important, capital at the
extiemitv of the United States. Having spent

people, whom he calls " Briufh Democrates"
for-celebrating the downfall of French delpot

" Notw-.tlidandinc the Emprels of Rudia has
been generally ranked amen: the over ambitious
and tyrannical potentates of the eattb, then- are
dill fomc traits iri her charatter, which discover
an attachment to the liberties , and happinefsof
mankind. Upon an idea luggeded by the late
Dr. Franklin, a quedion is now agitated at the
RuflianCcuit, that iu their future maritime

enemies (not laden with warlike (lores), {hall
not be mole (ted on the high seaÂ» or elsewhere
by the Ruffian public or private (hips of war that

equitable footing. If We examine the hi (lory of
mankind, we (hall fee, that in all ages war has
been the work of kings and nobles, and that
the multitude of every community have ever
been pitted against each other, to support the ho
nour and (uppofed interest of the monarch and
hj*circ!e ; which interest has uniformly been,
that mankindjhouldbc atvariance almojlperpetual

national quarrels will in future be decided as it
were, bv single combat of the parties immediately
concerned and their adherents, without involving
the peaceable tradesman, the adventurous mer-
induftiious planter, or the enterÂ»prifing
sailor ; all which clafTes, confiiruting the bulk of
a nation, are generally averse to war, if left to
themselves, and would gladly live at peace,
were it not for the worthless dregs of our. J pedes.,
who be;ng frequently placed at the head of af

As appears by No. 4, which containsa fumrnaryof

Mr. Cox, of Boflon, has concluded his con
trast with the corporation of Derry, refpefling
the bridge he has confined at that place. As
ler allowing the whole of Mr. Cox's charges*
the corporarion presented him with one hun->
dred pounds flerling, as a mark oftheir approba
tion. The citizens of Derry have voted Mr.
Coxa gold modal, value fifty guineas, with a
peifpe&ive view of that city on one fide, and the
following infeription on the other.â
To Lemuel Cox, of Boflon, in America, the
builder of the bridge of Londonderry, (a work
for magnitude of design, and simplicity of con
firuftion, unparalleled in the ealtern world) the
gentlemen of Derry, in token of their value for
his abilities, have presented this model, July 22,
1791. In addition to the foregoing, afilverum,
of the value of sixty pounds sterling, is intended
as a present to Mr. Cox from the cloth merchants
of Londonderry.
Accounts from Eofton fay, that violent exer
tions are making in that town for the toleration
of a Theatre. These are oppofe'd with equal vio
lence by mod of the clergy and rigid religionists
of the state, who have caught the alarm from
some hints lately thrown out by the lovers of the
drama, that " the stage might be made a school
of morality." Thcfe good gentlemen (the clergy)
on the contrary, l'ceni to have determined, that
morality {hall be taught in no school but their
own.
Several hints have been fuggeflcd in the Bos
ton prints, that Congress should, in the present
fefiion, pass alato, compelling the oamers of vejfds
to have their firflfats of fails made of American
duck, before the vejfcl shall be regijlercd.â To this
it has been objected, that in a country, like ours
perfectly free, where every man is liberty to
believe what he pleases, to wear what cloth he
pleafeson his back, and mokkifons or shoes ofi
his feet, as he fees bed ; it is, no more than
reasonable to allow hiin the lame liberty of
furnifliing his ship with canvass of his own
choosing.

WILL nought th' attempts of daring Mai
restrain ?
Nof the black profpeft of the awful dcep }
Nor the red lightning wing'd with storm,
Nor the wild winds that sweep,
And horribly deform
The whiten'd boiling of the boift'rous main!
In a frail plank fee him confide
When not a star affords it's ray,
And take a needle for his guide
Thro' the vait ocean's pathless way.
He, bolder still, the warring furface leaves j
Intruding, visits Nereus' wide domain,
Views the fta-monfters pearly caves,
Realm s ne v er difturb'd by noisy waves
And breaks the solemn silence of his reign.
But chief o'er earth, he holds refirtlefs sway :
Haughty mountains quit the skies,
Humble vallies tow'ring rife,
Head long rivers change their course,
Cataracts resign their force
And the firm texture of the rock gives way.
Lo ! ev'n he violates her parent bread,
From her dark bowels tears the ore,
Awakes the mifchief from it's reft,
Brings out the murd'rous aliments of death,
And ah ! too prodigal oi breath !
Teaches the mimic thunder how to raa*r !
Still air remains : he fees the feather'd brood
Cleave its foft bofofn with their easy vving,
Hang in the gales, or sport, or seek their food)
Or up to Heav'n on rapid pinions spring.
From low hung earth his views arise j
In his proud flight sighs to go
"o visit clearer skies
And leave the region of the storms below.
See, fee his busy mind
Already has combin'd
The powerful acid and the steel *
They war, they toil,
Whirl, foam, fermenting boil
And the whole rage of fierce contention feel.
View from their ftrife the vapour flee,
t's silken prison the light gaz difterid,
The globe impatient to get free
>elf-balanc'd, buoyant, leave th'admiring croud:
Triumphantly ascend
bear his car majestic thro' the clouds.
rhus, wondrous creature, thy all-grasping pow'
The fubjeft elements obey,
But o er thyfelf impends the gloomy hour
From which no force, no artj can favej
Thy glories muif decay,
Melt, melt away,
And blasted vanish at the dreary grave !

Defcrrption of Don Antonio Ulloa the Pbilofcphi,
liijlorian of South America.
I FOUND him perfectly the philosopher, fenfi
ble and well informed, lively in his conversation
tree and easy in his manners. Having observeÂ«
at his do'or two soldiers mounting guard, I expert
ed some pride of appearance, but I met with no
thing like it. This great man, diminutive ii
stature, remarkably thin and bowed down wftl
clad like a peasant, and surrounded by hi
numerous family of children, with the youngest
about two years old, playing on his knee, was fit
ting to receive mo.nmg visitors, in a room, th<
aimenfions and furniture of which, fora few mo
ments, diverted my attention from himfelf, tht
chief objedt of veneration. The room was twent\
feet long by fourteen wide, and less than eight fee:
high. In this I saw difyerfed confufedly, chairs
tables, trunks, boxes, books, and papers, a bed, ;
piefs, umbrellas, clothes, carpenter's tools, ma
thematical instruments, a barometer, a clock,
guns, pldlures, looking-glafles, foflils, mineral:
ana ihells, his kettle, bason, broken jugs, Amer
can antiquities, money, and a curious mummy
from the Canary island?, or at least its trunk
with the head and arms ; for having been the
common play-thing of his children, they
amused themselves with drawing its teeth anc
breaking off its limbs.
4 Among the extraneous foffils,.he /hewed me ;
variety of lea (hells, colledted by himfelfnear the
summits of the mountains in 'America
fume on the furface, but many bedded in tht
lime-stone rock. When I went to take my leav<
of him on quitting Cadiz, he presented me wit!
the Natural Hiftorv of Sjuth-America, a WQrJ<
highly dclerving to be tranfiated.*
LONDON, September 9.
Ycfterday the MefTengT in waiting was sent of

with letters to the King at Weymouth.
The declaration of the French King, to the
Deputation from the National Afi'embly whop*e
k nte-l the Constitutional A6l, " that he will jig
quit Paris," maybe confideieJ as a declaration
that he will accept the whole as offered to hin
without an) kind or qualification, but perhaps ar
expreliion of his hopes that if rhere be any
improper in it, the means which the Nationa
Afi'embly has provided, will be fuftcicnt to cor

On the 3d of January the Nabob of Arcot re
reived a pistol lhot horn an unknown hand, which
carried off one of his fingers, and made its way

happened daring a review, and are indifputabl

THE ARMAMENT.
We have fliewn from authentic documents,
that the minister, after putting the country to the
?xpence of an armament, gave up every point for
A'hich that armament was equipped, and engaged
to propose to the Forte the very fame terms of
peace the Empress h?xJ propcfed, before he had
3ut a single Ihip in conjmifllon.
It remains only to be (hewn, that as the nego
:iation went on, his character became equally
cnown to both parties : and, that it ne had pof
lelfed any thing like the information which a
Vlinifter ought to polfefs, he might hfeve favcd
Timfeif the disgrace of fubmitring to propose
terms of peace to the Porte, which the Porte was
ready to accept without deigning to consult him.
That the preliminaries of peace between Rufiia
ind the Porte were fignea before the result ot thp
legociations at Peter (burgh could pollibJy be
known except from a proper estimate of trie im
secility of Mr. Pitt, will appear from the fol
owing.

TONTINE FOREVER,
The value ot" Ihares in this does not depend Â«p
----n puffing, nor upon long speeches, maJe bv pre
ent adventurers. If a ihare be worth id'mere
han the coll ot it, we (hall have new Tontines.
Bank Scrip this could not have been said with
â qÂ»al certainty ; though it is highly probable that
'Iter matters are properly fixed, we'fliall have a
lew fubfeription for 24,000 fliares.
Pla-ufible icifonscan be given by plaufib'e men,
viihing such a measure, and you may reft allured,
hat ere long, we (hall have another rage of Bank
>crip. The last was wotfe to the country than a
leluge of all the Western Lands would have been.
But be that as it may, Tontines may be set up
n ever> state, and in every town, and the shares
:an never be worth more than they cost, and ifthev
ire worth fomucb, what could have been the mo
tives of the projectors of it ? was the great objrft
:o have a Tontine Piefident, and a Tontine Vice-
President, and Tontine Direflors, &c. If care is
not taken, we (hall be tontined out of our money
and our liberties. How does all Europe laugh at
Preftdents of little companies, and the paltry po
licy of making this western world, full of' K real
men !
'Tisjuft like voting, that every cent (haft pas'
for a guinea.
By all these new plans, which promise gain
.vithout labour, we are sapping the foundation ol
national dilfgence, and are making men too greal
;o be ufeful.
Now, if it be true, that this Tontine is such a
)leffing, do let it be demonstrated openly. Thi'
nftitution must be a curiofitv, which will m'aki

treat heap I address myfelf to men who havf

We are told, is now in contemplation, and wil
probably be opened in the course of a week, on .

GOSfcIEN, Nov. 1
A report, some time current here, has been re
ared vaiioufly : the following, however, we are
nclined to believe is neatly the truth, viz. That
n or about the firft of 00. ber, the mills ot the
â lonorable Cornelius C. Schoonmaker, Esq. at
ihawangunck, were set on fire and consumed, for
vhich he censured several perlor.iâthat a ihort
â¢me after, as a person wa's palling an unfrequent
d road, in the neighbourhood, he fell in with a
nan in a thicket of woods, armed with a mujket,
vho enquired ot him where Mr. Schoonmaker was,
>n being answered that he did not kn..w,
laffed each otherâthe unarmed person had nut'
proceeded far, before he began to reflect til at the
ituation and appearance ot the man, were myile
iousâln ftioit, he was impressed with an idea
hat some fatal proceedings were in agitation.
Under these apprehensions, he concealed his
horse, with an intention to return, and place him
feif in a situation where he might watch the ac
:lons ot the suspicious character ; he accordingly
advanced to an uncommon thick gr UU p of laurels,
vhere be might lay concealed ; on penetrating
he cluster, he found a giave newly degâlong,
tnd very deepâin consequence of this, he made a
ecret retreat and had the man apprehended, whq,
tie are informed, has since confefled th.,t he
>urnt the mills and was, at the time he was le
ered laying in wait to execute his desperate in
entions of murdering Mr. Schoonmaker and de
lofiting his body in the grave mentioned.
