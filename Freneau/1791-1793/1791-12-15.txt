On the PLEASURES of IGNORANCE,
[Tranfktsd from a late Fren'ch Author. |
T : F we conflder things aright, we shall

Saving of nature, and rnoft frequently ;
bis fling to man. Error, on the contra
r>Â», is too often the concomitant of ou
vim (ciences, and is always attendei
with misfortune.
To this the politicians of the prefen
day, who are lo fond of descanting oi
the enlightened age we live in, whet
contrasted with the barbarous ones tha
have preceded, would reply, What
was it not ignorance that so lately car
r.ed fire and sword through Europe
ilnd shed the blood of its inhabitants so.

kniwer, No âIgnorance lay inactive al

to all these enormities âthe errors o
people who ware fare they were in th<

â we do at this day, and the prejudices o

How many evils might ignoranci
have concealed from us, which ever l
man myft; encounter in his paiiage thro
life, without the possibility of avoidinj
them ; such as the infidelity of friends
the vicillitudes of fortune, iiander, an.
the hour of death ; the prospect o
which is terrible to the boldest of men
The knowledge of these evils alone a

are the real bleffibgs of hie heightened
alio, by ignorance. Ihe illusions o
love and Ihendfhip, the cheering pre!
pests of hope, and even the gratifies
lions that the Icier.ces prormfe to th<
enquiring mind, all take their colour
ing from ignorance. The fcienccs an

An opulent native of Franc? was of
his travels through Greece last Julv
when he heard the news of the deat.
of the celebrated Mirabcau, by a Mai ten
Tartane. The indisposition of oneofhi:
companions had induced him toma.u
I'ome ftav in the ancient city of Athen:
now called Hetines) where they had toi
lome time employed themlelves in vitit
ine the Pireum, and making oblerva
'ions upon the remains of antiquity
hereabouts. The tower of Demoh
acnes, which is yet (landing, and af
fords Ihelter in the lower itory to -
jrotherhood of Capuchin friars, gave
hem the idea of eredtinj upon this im
mortal clalTic ground a monument of
he fame kind to the memory of Miu
3eau. Having gathered up some bro
ken pieccs from the ruins of the fem
ale of Jupiter Olympus, they railed
1 fort of mutilated pillar, leveral feet
in height, on thetop of which they pla
ced a large cockade with the.e woids
inferibed thereof, âTo the memory of Ml-

The national assembly nave vouch
.sfed to recommend io mothers and to
wives the inculcating the new consti -
tutional principles upon the minds of
their children. But let us look into
his matter : Have they made a single
aw which permits the female part of the
community to act or think like free a-
The children they bring into the
world they, by law, have no property in.
The husband, if he is a spendthrift,
may even fell his wife, if he pleases, for
any thing the national assembly has
lone to prevent him. The man, in
raft, is sole possessor of the goods of
he family ; he can do almost whatever
ie pleases ; and although there is an end
to despotic power in the person of the
king, it is not yet abolished in respect to
he power of the husband over the wile,
jut is left like the toothings on a rough
wall, to disgrace the beauty of an edi
sice, in all other respects highly finished
md beautiful to the eye.
In the present momentary (lumber of
he arts a public spirited company
if ast ids have rou fed from the general
lethargy, and are preparing a work
which will remain a lading monument
of the national genius of France. Eigh
teen capital sculptors have united their
abilities to croft this great work, a mo
ld of which maybe seen at the Feuillans.
This monument will be in the figure of
1 column and may be called truly trium
phal, since the (lory of all the different
viftories of liberty over tyrants and ty
ranny at different periods of time are to
be represented upon nine reliefs, which
will separate the column into as many
horizontaT zones. The statue of Liber
ty is to appear on the summit. Allego
rical figures, in relief, relating to the
French constitution will decorate the
base, with the statutes of the four philo
sophers who may be considered as the
anthors of the liberties of France.â
The column is to be two hundred and
sixty six feet high.
The National Assembly, being defi
rous of establishing a uniformity of
weights and measures in the kingdom
of France, have ordered the Academy
as Sciences to make the necessary prepa
rations for this purpose. In confe
rence of this order, the commissioners
appointed by the Academy are proceed
ing as expeditiously as possible to accom
plish this great object. Their operati
ons, however,- will be attended with
considerable expcnce ; some having esti
mated it in gross, at ieveral millions,
liutthecommiflioncrs' estimate is only
300,000 livres {Â£. 22,500 Pennsylvania
currency). The length of time necefia
ry for completing the operations has
likewise been much exaggeratedâbut
the Commifficners have given it as their
opinion, that two years will be fuffici
cnt. Great numbers of labourers are
already engaged, and numbers of peo
ple are soon to set out on long journies
;n consequence of the nature of the de
ugn ; which is, in the firft place, to mea
ure a quadrant of the meridianbetween
L> unk i 1 k and Barcelona, and from thence
-Seduce iuch observations and expert
ments as will tend to establish a deter

It is commonly said that money is the
sinews of war. Waris much talkedof
by several European nations, but let us
:onfider a moment whether theypoffefs
the means of re-commencing any wars
very speedily. âAs to Rufiia, (he isomer
head and ears in debt, without credit,
ar>d her paper felling at a loss of 26 per
cent. The King of Sweden is in a situ
ation not much better. In his last war
with Ruffu, it is well known that his
kingdom, at best thinly peopled, facri
ficed at leaftoue hundred thousand taen.Ko onecanbe ignorant of theenormou:

thought, will finally prove too might]
for them. Should thisfecond Alexandei
the great fueled in his splendid defier
of driving the British out of India, lh<
-ban India company will become bank
rupt. It can be proved that a threi
years maritime war would drain th<
Treasury of London to the laftfarthin<r
and if a revolutional spirit should feiz<
the people, universal confufion woulc
be the lflue in that Island. The finance:
or ilol.and are in but a poor conditi
on. Ihe main sources, that formerly
rendered this republic so flourifhing
are now dryed up ; and their Eaft-Indi;
company is in a forlorn condition. A 1
their misfortunes arise from the failurt
oftheir revolution. In refpea to Pruf
fia, her finances are yet in tolerable gooc
order, thanks to the ceconomy of the
Late King ; but his maxims and pruden
tial rules of government are too mucl
neglected by his successor. There ar<
in his treasury about 90 millions of ri>
dollars, out of which the present state o
his affairs will oblige him to expenc
eighteen millions in less than two year:
to come ; and one more year of wa:
would prodigiously rcducethe capital.â
Ihe 1 souse ot Austria muffc exert th(
ftriftcft ceconomy to put its finances ir
any thing of a respectable situation, th<
war with the Turks and intestine revo
lutions having a good deal exhauftec
tneir treasury. 1 hey have re-conquer
ed the Belgic provinces, it is true
but the vast military force they are O'
bliged to keep up in those provinces
consumes, not only the three million:
annual tax paid by them, but also agrea:
deal more in addition thereto. The pur
fes of mod of the German Princes an
empty liach individual among then
counts too much upon his rank as ;
great sovereign to think of ceconomy ir
their expendituresâUpon the whole
a European league of powers againf

project, contrived by persons who art
ignorant of the real character of the
French Nation, and who would wish ti

Secretary of War.
Fort JVaJhington, Nov. 9, 1791.
S 1 Rj '
afternoon the remains of the
irrny under my command got back to this place,
md have now the painful talk to give you an
iccount of as warm and unfortunate an afiion as
ilmolt any that has been fought, in which every
orps was engaged and worfled, except the firfl
cgimentâthat had been detached upon a fer
"ce I had the honor to inform you of in my Jaft
HI patch, and had not joined me.
On the third lnflant the army had reached a creek
bout twelve yard, wide, running to the fouth
vard of weft, which 1 believe to have been ihe
iver St. Mary, that empties itfelf into the Miami
the lake; arrived at the Miami village, about
t 0 clock yi the afternoon, having marched near
1 miles, and were immediately encamped unon
1 very commanding piece of ground in two lines
"laying the above mentioned creek in front The
Ight wing com poled of Butler's, Clark's and
. atterlon s battalions, commanded by maior-gen
'fa fo â¢ cd th e firfl line, and the'left
<v.ng consisting of Bedinger's and Gai.her's bau
a 10ns, and the second regiment commanded by
leutenant-colonel Daike, formed the second line
A'Uh an interval between them of about seventy

â  ldv j a . ri Â«-<l about one quarter of a mile and en
â ampedinthe lame order. There were a f-w
Indians who appeared on the opposite fide of tb~
â¢ reek but fled with the utmofl precipitation on
j . advani:c , of t!,e mill Ha. At this place, which
1 judged to be about fifteen miles from the Mi
inn village, I had determined to throw up a flight
K'ori;, the plah of which was concerted that ever
ng with major Fergufon, wherein to have depo
ned the men's knapsacks, and every thin, elle
hat was not of absolute necelfitv, and to"have
noved on to attack the enemy as 'soon as the lirft
â¢egtment was come up ; but they did not ner
mt me to execute either- for on the 4 th, about
a f?r' e sunrise, and when ihe men
been n J"I difmiffcd from the paiade Tor it
"as a conflant practice to have them all under
irms a considerable time before day-light) an at
ack was made upon the militia-thofe gave way
n a very little time, and ruflied into camp through
najor Butler's battalion, which, together with
art of Clarke's, they threw into considerable
ionl Jt a u u W r lCll i nolwiti iftanding the exer
â ons of boih those officers, was never altonether
cmeaied the Indians following close at their
leels. Ihe fire, however, of the fiiU lineChecked ihem, but almost instantly a very hea
vy attack began upon that line, and in a few mi
nutes it was extended to the second like wifeâthe
great weight of it was dire&ed against the centrt
of each, where the artillery was placcd, and frorc
which the men were repeatedly driven with
great Daughter. Finding no great effect from ou
fire, and confufion beginning to spread from th<
great number of men who were falling in al
quarters it became neccffary to try what could be
done by the bayonet. Lieutenant Colonel Darl
was accordingly ordered to make a charge wit!
part of the second line, and to turn the left flanl
of the enemyâthis was executed with great fpi
ntâthe Indians infiantly gave way, and were dri
ven back three or four hundred yards; but so
want of a- fufficient number of riflemen to purfut
this advantage, they soon returned, and the troop
were obliged to give back in their turn âAt thi
moment they had entered our camp bv the lef
flank, having pushed back the troops that wer<
polled there. Another charge was made here b]
the lecond regiment, Butler's and Clarke's bat
talions, with equal effect, and, it was repeate<
several times, and always with success; in all o
them many men were loft, and particularly tin
officers, which with fo'raw troops, was a loss al
together irremediable.âln that just spoke of
iuflde by the 2nd regiment, and Butler's battal
lion major Butler was dangero.ufly wounded, am
every officer of the 2nd regiment {fell, excep
three, one of whom, Mr. Grcaton, was (hot thro
the body. Our artillery being now lilenced, an<
all the officers killed, except Capt. Ford, wh<
was very badly wounded, and more than half o
the army fallen, being cut off from the road, 1
became ncceffary to attempt the regaining it, ant
to make a retreat, if pofiible.âTo this purpof
the remains of the army were formed, as well a
circumstances would admit, towards the right o
the encampment, from which by the way of thi
Â«nd line, another charge was made upon the ene
my, as if with the design to turn their right flank
but, in fact to gain the road, âThis was effe&ed
and, as soon as it was open, the militia tool
along it, followed by the troops, major Clarke
with his battalion, covering the rear. The re
treat, in these circnmfiances, was, you may b<
sure, a very precipitate oneâit was, in faÂ£, ;
flightâThe camp and the artillery were aban
doned : but thai was unavoidable, for not an horl<
was lefialive, to have drawn it off, had it other
wife been practicable. But the molt difgracefu
part of the bufinefsis, that the greater part of th<
men threw away their arms and accoutrements
even after the pui suit, (which continued abou
four miles) had ceased. I found the road strew
ed with them for many miles, but was not able t<
remedy it; for having had all my horses killed
and being mounted upon one that could not b<
pricked out of a walk, I could not get for wan
myfelf; and the orders I sent forward, either t<
halt the front, or to prevent the men from parting
with their arms, were unattended to.
The route continued quite to fort Jefferfon
twenty-nine miles, which was reached a little as
ter sun-setting.
The a&ion began about half an hour befor<
fun-rife, and the retreat was attempted at half ar
hour after uine o'clock.
1 have not yet been able to get returns of the
killed and wounded : but major-general Butler
lieutenant-colonel Oldham of the militia; majoi
Fergufon, major Heart, and major Clarke, art
among the former. Colonel Sargent, my adju
tant-general,heutenaut-colonel Dark, lieutenant
rolone! Gibfon, major Butler, and the Vifcoun
Malartie, who feived me as an aid-cte-camp, an
among the latter, and a great number of captain:
and subalterns in both.
I have now, Sir, finifhed my melancholy taleâ
a tale, that will be felt sensibly by every one tha
has sympathy for private distress, or for publii
misfortune. I have nothing, . v ir, to lay to th<
charge of the troops but their want of dilcipline
which, from the short time they had been in fer
vice, it was impossible they should have acquired
and which rendered it verry dillicult, when thei
were thrown into confufion, to reduce them agaii
to order, and is one reason why the loss has fallei
so heavy upon the officers, who did every thing ii
their power to effc6t it ; neither were my owi
etertions wanting, but worn down with illness, ant
fulTering under a painful disease ; unable either t<
mount, or dismount an horse, without assistance
they were not so great as they otherwise would
and perhaps, ought to have been.âWe weri
overpowered by numbers; but it is no more thai
justice to observe, that though composed of so mair
different species of troops, the utmoil harmon]
prevailed thro the whole army during the cam
paign.
At fort Jefferfon, I found the firft regiment
which had returned from the service they had beei
sent upon without either overtaking the deserter
or meeting the convoys of provision. I am not cer
tain, Sir, whether 1 ought to cvnfider the abfenc<
of this regiment from the field of a&ion as for
tfinate, or otherwiseâl incline to think it wa
fortunate; for I very much doubt whether hat
it been in the a&ion, the fortune of the day ha<
been turned : and if it had not, the triumph o
the enemy would have'been mÂ«re complete, an<
the country would have been deftkute ever
means of defence.
Taking a view of the situation of our brokei
troops at Fort Jefferfon, and that there was no pro
visions in the Fort, I called upon the field officers
viz, Lieutenant Colonel Dark, Major
Major Zeigler, and Major Gaither, together wit!
the Adjutant-General for their advice, what woulc
be proper further to bedone, and it was their unani
mous opinion, that the addition of the ft regiment,
unbroken as it was, did not put the army on fc
refpe&able a footing as it was in the morning, be
cause a great part of it was now unarmed âthat it
had been then found unequal to the enemy; and
fhotild they come on, which was probable, would
be found so againâThat the troops could not be
thrown into the Fort, both because it was so fmail
and that there were no provisions in itâThat
provisions were known to be upon the road at the
distance of one, or at most two marches,--Thai
therefore it would be proper to move, without lofi
time to meet the provisions, when the nter
might have the sooner an opportunity of some re
frefhment, and that a proper detathment migln
be sent back with it to have it fafely deposited ir
the Fort. This advice was accepted, and the ar
my put in motion again at 10 o' clock and mar
ched a]l uight, and the succeeding day met with ;
quanti ty of flour ; part of it was distributed im
mediately ; part taken back to supply the army or
the* march to Fort Hamilton, and the remain
der, about fifty horse loads, sent forward to Fori
Jeffcrfcn ; the next day a drove of cattle was mei
with for the fame place, and I have information
that both got in : The wounded who had been lefi
at that place, were ordered to be brought here by
the retnrn herfes.
1 have said, Sir, in'a former part of this letter
that we were overpowered by numbers : of that,
however, I have no other evidence but the weighi
of the fire, which was always a mod deadly one
arid generally delivered from the ground, few o!
the enemy (hewing themselves on foot, except
when they were charged ; and that in a few mi
nutes our whole camp, which extended above
three hundred and fifty yards in length, was entire
ly surrounded and attacked on all quarters.
The loss, Sir, the public has sustained by the sal
of so many officers, particularly general Butler anc
major Fergufon, cannot be too much regretted
but it is a circumstance that will alleviate the mis
fortune in some measure, that til of them fell mod
gallantly, doing their duty. I have had verj
particular obligations to many of them, as well a
to the survivors, but to none more than to colone
Sargent âHe has discharged the various duties o:
his office with zeal, with exaitnefs and with in
telligence, and on all occasions afforded me even
assistance in his power, which 1 have also experi
-need from my aid-de-camp, lieutenaut Denny
md the Viscount Malartie, who served with m
in the station as a volunteer.
With every sentiment of refpedl and regard
I have the honor to be, fir,

FOR the NATIONAL GAZETTE.
MUCH has been said in Congress on the sub
jeCt of the enumeration, and to be sure if
cue pun) and direCt expreflions of the constitution
on this lubjeCt are to be departed from, it would
be well to confiderfor what reason or in pursuit of
what principle it is to be doneâLet it be remem
bered that the Federal Government is founded on
a folemo compact of sovereign and independent
states, and in its formation is laid by the conven
tion that framed it to be, " the result of a spirit
*' of amity, and of that mutual deference and
if concejpon which the peculiarity of our political
" iituation rendered indifpenfible."âLet it also be
remembered that this concefiicn is manifefted on
he one hand by the large states in admitting an
equal representation in the Senate, and on the
other hand by thelmall states in admitting a re
prelentation in the House of Representatives ac
cording to the refpeElive numbers of each state,
provided (as a farther security to the small States)
that each state should have at least one Represen
tative. In the election of a President too, it is
observable that the states rejpeElively have a fixed
degree of influence, according to the refpeCiive
numbers of Senators and Representatives to which
they are rejpe&'rvely entitled j nor is this a matter
within the discretion of Congress, .but must result
from the operation of thaft ratio mentioned in the
constitution which forms the principle of repre
fentntion to which the states respeCtively and in
dividually are entitled.âNo plausible, specious,
and I will add insidious pretexts of equality, will
juftlfy such a flagrant violation of the constituti
onal rights of states.âBut in order to ftiew the
insidious nature of such pretexts and how far
equality is in truth regarded, I subjoin a statement
of the three states of New-Hampshire, Ma/Tachu
letts, and Connecticut, /hewing their relpeCtive
fcederal numbers, the number of members to '
which each of the said states is entitled according
to the ratio of onf for 30,000, and a quotient
therefrom shewing the number of people repre
sented by each member according to the said ap
portionment, and conrrafting therewith a like
statement for the three states of Rhode-lfiand,
Kentuckey ana Georgia, from which contrast it '
will be seen whether equality is in truth desired,
or the incereft of lmall states regarded in the much (
contended for amendments to the original bill '
which pafied the House of Representatives.

increase the representation of those best 1

M. Duportail, the Minister at war, gave an ac
:ountof the situation of the armv, and the plÂ»-
:es of strength on the frontiers. 'The result of his
leta.l was, that from Bergue to Befort, all the
Fortified places were in an excellent (late -of de
fence. Thofeon the frontiers of Savoy, and to
wards the Pyrenees, although not equally provided
(or defence, were in no danger of attack. The
snows coveiing the mountains which separate
France in that quarter from the neighbouring
kingdoms, render any invasion during the winter
mpracHcable, and, in the mean time, every pof
ib;e exertion was making to recruit the troops and
:omplete the fortifications of the garrisons. Of
:he National Guards ordered by the Afrembly for
[he delence of the frontiers, more than sixty bat
:alions were already marched, or ready to march,
0 the,r "fpe<2ive places of deflation. Several

which had been lately removed by the National
Alfembly. Partial disorders dill subsided in some

And yet admire the blushing rose )
On Celia's cheek the bloom you prize
And yet on mine that bloom despise.

To which all boly men aspire j

Bccaule in spirits ] delight.
Whene'er I fall, and crack my crown (
You blame me much for falling down-
Yet to some god that you adore
You, too, fall proflrate on the floor.
You call me f>o! for drinking hard,
And yet old Hudson you regard
Who fills his jug from yonder bay
And drinks his guts full every day.
