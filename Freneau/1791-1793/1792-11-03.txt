interesting advices more in detail coileft
ed from foreign pipers.]
THE Duke of Brunfwick, with very
little oppoTition, hns trade himfelf
master of Longwi. a ilrong place, well
provided according to some accounts, with
men, ammunition and provisions ; but ac
cording to others containing but a few
hundred troops.
The firft give it a garrison of 2636
men, who fall into the hands of the duke,
with 38 pieces of cannon, See- iÂ£c. 415,000
wt. of ptnvder, and other ammunition in
propottion.
The general bombarded it for a (ho> t
time, it furrt-ndered, and the firing was
immediately commanded to cease.
The duke after the capture of thii
placc advanced towards Verdun, and fum
monedthe parrifon to surrender about thÂ«
30th of August.
The summons is in the name of their
Imperial and Prufiian majeflies, and in it
the inhabitants are threatened with mili
tary execution if they dd not surrender,
and return to their allegiance. In cafe oi
compliancc they are prom;fed the protec
tion of the king of Prussia and the empe
ror.
A council of war was called to anfwei
the summons, and it was determined U
hold out to the last moment.
Upon the receipt of this intelligence in
Paris, on the 2d of September, the com
mifiioners of the community aflembled and
pafied a doctee to the following effect,
which was approved by the national affem
; *â¢
That the barriers te (hut, all lwfes.be
fcized for military ferviC-. all ftifpefted per
ions be disarm.'d, and all citizens dirtdted
to hold themselves in readiness to marcli
at the firft notice. The decree also invitee
them to meet at the Champ dc Mars, thai
60,000 men might be immediately raised
for the service of the country
Alarm guns \Â»ere fired, the barriers
shut, the Toe (in was founded, and the ge
neral alarm beaten. The Champ de Mar;
was presently filled, and the enrolment wai
proceeding rapidly.
At this time intelligence reachcd the
capital, that a body of 4000 French, de
tached by Dumourier to the afilftance o:
Verdun, had been defeated, and obligee
to retreat. The populace fufpedted trea
chery ; their rage rose to its greateO
height.
ll was suggested by some am'ong their
at imprudent for so powerful a body a:
60,000 men to quit the metropolis, leaving
the great number of suspicious persons
with which every placc oT confinement
overflowed, and the barbarous propofa
was made to put them all to death.
The people fiew to the convent of ths
Carmelites, and massacred about 13c
/ priests, who vere confined there, among
whom was the cardinal de Rouchefou
cald, formerly archbishop of Rouen.
i'rom this they hurried to the Abbaye,
where all those confined were put to death,
to the number of f orae hundreds. Among
the vidtims of the fury of the people.
Madame Tarvante, See. with
M. Montmorin, the ex-minister, and M,
13'Affry, were particularly mentioned.
The afiembly sent commiffionefs to pro
thefe persons, but without avail. Bui

academy far inftrudting the deaf and the
dumb, who was saved by the interference
of a member of the national afTembly, ant
an old nian, whose grey hairs commanded
refceft.
From the pr sons the mob proceeded tc
â¦he houses of fufpedted persons, and where
ever letters were found breathing a coun.
ter revolution spirit, the writers orowaers
met immediate death.

This declaration, dated at Rochefort,

[The following communication was made
to Earl Gower (late English ambassador at
Paris) by his court, and from him to the
French ininifter for foreign affairs :J
My Lord,
IN Lurd Grenville's obfence, I have re
ceived and laid before the king, your last
dispatches.
His majesty has been very deeply afflitted
in receiving the information of the extent
and the deplorable confeijuences of the
troubles which have happened in Paris ; a
well on account of his personal attachment
to their raoft Christian Majesties, and the
interest that he has always taken in their
welfare, as for the earned: defirehe has for
the tranquility and profperitv of a kingdom
with which he is on terms of friendfiiip.
As it appears, in the present {fate of af
fairs, the exercise of the executive power
has been withdrawn from his mod: Christian
Majesty, the credentials which have hither
to been made use of by your excellency,
CAN NO LONGER BE VALID. His
majesty is therefore of opinion, that you
ought not to remain any longer in Paris, as
well on this account, as becatife this step
appears to him the molt comforrnabie to
the principles of neutrality which he has
hitherto observed. His majeftv's plcafure
therefore is, that you should quit that city,
and return to England, as soon as you lhÂ«!i
have been able to procure the neceflary
passports for that purpose.
In all the conversations that you may
have occasion to hold, before your depar
ture, you will take care to express yourfelf
conformable to the sentiments herein conv
municateCi to you, and you will take espe
cial care not to neglect any opportunity e
declaring, that at the fame time his.majesty
means to observe the principles of neutra-,
lity, in every- thing which regards the ar
rangement Of the internal government of
France. He does not conceive that he de
parts from these principles in manifefting,
by every poflible means in his power, his
solicitude for the personal situation of their
most Christian Majesties, and the royal fa
mily. He mofl: earnestly hopes, that his
wishes in that refpeÂ£t will not be deceived ;
that the royal family will be preserved from

HENRY DUNDAS.
Aug. 17, 1792.
Answer to the above by the French mini
fter for foreign affairs :
The nuderfigned, ininifter for foreign af
fairs, has loft no titlrfe in con-imunicating to
the provisional executive council, the letter
communicated to him by his excellency
Earl Gower, ambassador extraordinary
from his Britannic rnajefty.
The council has seen, with regret that
the British cabinet has Vefolved to recall an
ambassador, whose presence attested the fa
vorable disposition of a free and generous
nation, and who has never been the organ
but of friendly expreflions and ofbenevo
lent sentiments. If any thing can abate
this regret, it is the renewed aflinance of
neutrality made 011 the part of England to
the French nation.
This assurance ffeems to be the result of
an intention wifely considered and formal
ly exprelfed by his Britannic majesty, not to
meddle with the interior arrangements of the affairs
if France. We are not surprised at such a
declaration made by an enlightened and
high fpiriled nation, who have been the
firit to acknow ledge and establish the prin
ciple of national sovereignty ; who, by fub
ftitnting the empire of the laws,*he expres
sed will of all, to tile arbitrary caprices of
a few individuals, have been the firft to
furnifli the example of fnbjefting kings
themfeives to this salutary yoke ; and who,
finally, have not thought too dearly pur
chased, by long convullions, and violent
ftonns, that liberty, which has been pro
ductive of so much glory and prosperity.
This principle of the unalienable sove
reignty of the people is going to be display
ed, in a striking manner, in the national
convention, the convocation of which has
been decreed by the legislative body, and
which will, 110 doubt, fix all parties and all
interests. The French nation has good
grounds to hope that the British cabinet
will not. at this decisive moment, depart
from that juflice, moderation and impar
tiality, which it has hitherto manifefted.
Full of this confidence, which rests on
facts, the underligned renews to his excel
lency Earl Gower, in the name of the pro
visional executive council, the assurance
which he has had the honor to give him,
viva voce, that whatever relates to the com
merce between the two nations, and all af
fairs in general, shall be carried on, oil the
part of the French government, with the
fame jnftice and fidelity. The council flat
ter themfeives that there will be a full re
ciprocity on the part of the British govern
ment. and that nothing will interrupt the
goud understanding which subsists between
the two nations.

Brvjfcls, Aug. 24. M. la Fayette was
taken in the following manner On the
19th, at ten in the evening, a patrole con
filling offeven men, belonging to the ad
vanced polls qfiÃochefort, in Ardennes, : in
the Bifhoprick ofLeige, where M. Har
noncourt Commands, met with a number
of French officers, followed by about 20
domeftjes. They were 011 the point of
being fired at by the piquCt guard, but
â¢ instantly one the quitted his
company, and was conducted to M. Har
noncourt.
" This gentleman was M. Bureau de
Pnfy, officer of engineers. He declared,
that his friends and himfelf were French
emigrants going to Holland. M. Harnon
i court asked him, Irow it happened, that
they were not going to join the princes?
M. Bureau answered, that, differing in
opinion from them, they preferred going
to Holland. M. Harnoncoiirt told hiin,
that they niuft be treated as prisoners of
war. Not one of the whole < ompany
objected to giving his parole, except M.
Uexander de Lameth, who began a fine
speech on the rights of nations, and said
that they were arretted in a neutral coun
try. They were then in the principali
ty of Leige. M- Harnoncourt answered,
that the French had faeen so extremely cle
ver in confounding all kinds of rights,
and the rights of nations in particular, that
it was no wonder ifmiflakes ihould be the
consequence- M. de Lameth threatened
to write to M. de Mercy. M. Harnon
court was not intimidated ; and those
gentlemen are now fafe in Namur, where
they are to remain until the duke of
Briiiifwick decides on their fate. They
have declared, that the army which they
have quitted is encamped behind la Chiere,
between Jdouzon and Sterat. It is fa d
that M- la Fayette had attempted to found
the dispositions of his soldiers, and finding
that they had resolved to fhoet him, and
. being desirous himfelf of living a little
longer, he took the firft opportunity to
pafsinto an enemies country.

Late nevus from Evgltfh â and Ir'ijh papers
LONDON, Sep. 1.
By the foreign mails, arrived yeflerday
morning, the probability of a rupture be
tween the Turks and Atiftrians increases
daily ; a body of 12.000 Turks, with a Pa
cha at their head, having lately approach
ed Chockzim, & demanded the evacuation
of the place ; but *on being informed by
the governor that he could not agree to
f his demand without a special order fpom
Vienna, the Turkish commander was

Extracl frcii a letter â  I tiie Kentuckey Gazette, da

" Official fay, that the five low
er towns of the Cherokee* have declared
war, and that three hundred Cherokees,
arid orre hundred Creek Indians, Were to
march the -th infianr, a|Â»ainft fume part of
this territory ; that it is uncertain on what
quarter the stroke will fall, but it is expect
ed the dejign is formed agaipft Cumber
land. The war appears inevitable. How
ihall we avert the impendingftorni, protest
the i inocent, and reltore a bleeding coun
try to peace ? Will mill ions of dollars, laid
I out in presents, a'nd given to the enemy,
obtain the object P I answer no. It has
long been infilled on, that the friendlliip of
I'Hians can be purchaftd. , I deny the opi
nion to be founded oil reason ; and experi
ence has taught us othcrwife. I have resi
ded on the frontiers for twenty years pall,
and claim fonie knowledge of Indiail af
fairs ; and if permitted to judge from ex
perience, rear is the best and only allurance
ot the friendfhip of an Indian. The idea
ol forming treaties a :d purcliating peace of
the Cherokee Indians, is as abftird to me as
th: fabulous ftorv or the goat treating with
the wolf, for the lecurity of her kids, and
I blulh to think that the policy of the In
dians has so far exceeded that of the en
lightened nation in which I live ; but it
may, be that the great \\ i.tlom 6f our conucils
mavhave beer, employed on objeÂ£ts more
inters iling. I (hall not pretend to fav that
the citizens of Philadelphia have no regard
for the inhabitants weft of the Apalachian
mountains, but t know that things at a dis
tance are often viewed a indifferent, and
muil think that it would be difficult to make
a citizen of the wei'cern country believe
that if Philadelphia was attacked by an ene
my that was'known to be as faithlef as the
Cherokee Indians, that the inhabitants of
that city would think it any protection to
them to give such an enemy guns, cloathes,
and ammunition. The Indians boast that
we bad rather give them our property, than
defend it by our arms; and that by ma
king war against us, they can at any time
they please, bring on a treaty and obtain
prelents and . peace. And it is also laid,
that great debates have lately been had a
niong the Cherokee Indians, which would
be the â moic advantageous to them, the
stealing of horses or taking women and
children prisoners, and that th? latter seem
ed by the moll able politicians among them,
to be most approved of, from the very high
prices which some of our citizens gave for
their friends who were lately captured at
Cumberland. lam told that the Hanging
Maw, Little TU'i'.ey, and the upper tewns
pretend that they are for peace, and .that
ibme credit is given to theirpromifes. The
Little Turkey is an Indian, and I well re
member the conduct of the Hanging Maw
in the year 1786, when Keanna and his par
ty decoyed hnd murdered Read and Bishop.
That very fellow, when I marched into
one of their town's, and demanded the mur
derers, informed me that Keanna and all
his party had run off to the northward In>
dians, and that he would deliver them up if
ever any of them came into his towns. A
tew hours after this promise was made by
the Hanging Maw, Keanna, by an unex
pected event, through the good conduit of
Majors Lee and M'Farfand, fell into our
Vandj, and was fortunately Ihot through
the head by Col. Outlaw. Thisinult prove
how little Mr. Hanging Maw is to be de
pended on. Last year John Watts was our
beloved confident. We n6\v learn, that he
is commander of the army that is marching
against us. Will experience never teach
men wisdom ? The idea of half war half
peace, was a novelty until the year 1776;
then introduced by the Cherokee. , and ever
since fuffered to be carried 011 by that peo
ple, which I pronounce to be the word of
wars that ever had an exiltence, and (hews
a want of policy in the nation that fuffers it
to be carried on against them, and is the
most advantageous to those who carry it
on.
The Indians, as a nation, must be ac
countable for the depredations committed
by theiP* people, or every idea of benefit
from a treaty is defeated. The effect ot
half.war half peace amounts to this 5 the
infirm, aged, and fucli as the Indians call
inufh-men. resort to the upper towns,
where they are fuffered to remain in peace
to make provil'ons for their army ; serve as
a barrier between us and them, and give
them every neceflbry intelligence they wish
to receive, to such as are in arms against
us.
We must have peace ; the horrors of war
are too painful any longer to be endured ;
by giving presents, we enrich our enemy
and teach them to fceliev* we are afraid of
them ; and I do no: scruple to fay, that the
best way to obrain a firm and lrtfting peace,
is to make a Aidde'n, iiKliferirmnate, well
direited attack on our enemiesâl mean the
Cherokee Indians. If we attack the upper
towns they will find that we are determi
ned 110 longer to (land by as idle fpeftators,
and fee our dearest friends and nearest re
lations murdered, scalped, taken captives,
burnt, ,and butchered by the barbaroii;
hands of unprovoked and unrelenting sava
ges. By making the attack on them, we
lhall save our friends; tbe/'will recall their
army to defend their own, by which we
may evade the stroke intended againfl
Cumberland, and evince to the world, that
we have judgment to difcero, and power tc
pttnifh offences ; I mean that the Unites!
States lias this judgment and power ; but I
iear that even a ciifcretionary power is not
lodged with the firft officer of this govern
ment, to punilh tiie Indians for the crimes
they commit ngainft the law of nature and
nations, or I am confident he would think
the present a proper time to exefcife that
power."
[Circumflantial account of the ariftocratit
forces from Martinico, taking the French
transports out of the road of St. Kitts.
Bajjctcrre, Oct. 4. âA squadron of French
transports, consisting of 10 or ir, with a
bout 2200 national troops on board, escort
ed by a frigate, lately arrived at Marti
ri que, but were not fuffered to land, be
ing ordered away immediately. A part of
them put into Montferrat, and three came
here for water and proviiions, being in great
diflrefs for botiiâThey have neither mo
ney or credit. They sent to Guadaloupe,
but were refuted any kind of affiitnnce, and
forbid, 0:1 pain of death, coming there.
Thole at Montferrat, with the commo
dore, have (ince failed, but where they are
gone, we have not been able to learn. Yef
terdr.y a French 40 gun ship, and another
frigate anchored in Old Road, and ordered
the three transports away immediately,
with directions to qtlit these seas. The
President fetit an officer on board, to inform
the Captain, that they were then under the
protection of the Britifliâ He a;:fwereci,
that if they were Under the protection of
the devil he would have them. He, how
ever, fainted the officer (Lieut. Hay, of
the artillery) both 011 going and coining,
with four guns. In this Situation matters
remained till this morning, when the offi
cers of both parties were to meet the Pre
sent, and fubniit the whole to his deci
iion.

ed, from undoubted authority, that the
commodore of the French frigate is MAL-

take the Proserpine, Capt. Byron, and ac
tually failed from 'Statia for that purpose,
: v ut was in the end taken himfelf by Capt.
Byron off Montferrat ; he is a native of
Guadaloupe. He lent an insolent letter to
Mr. Efdaiie, our President, last night,
threatening to carry off the transports, and
if the national troops were not delivered up,
that when he got the fbip; to sea he would
land his troÂ»ps with field pieces and put
h-ma 11 to death. He said that a counter
revolution took place in France 011 the 3d
us September, and that he ablolutely mult

[They all landed last night, in number a

lie has already put into execution, as he is
cow Handing to windward with ali the

But whether he means to execute the
latter, time is to determine. The com
mander of the troops declared, that rather
than be given up to the frigate, he would
kill himfejf, knowing well the consequen

Wednesday last arrived the ship Pigou,

he came into our Capes lall Monday.
By t'lis vtiTel we learn that there have

England i there are Hill in the granaries
arge quantities of old wheat.
A paflenger in this ship had been in

ie is of opinion, that :he intelligencere

t-ery generally erroneousâand that French
affairs do not, by any means, appear un
favourable to the friends of freedom.
Capt. Gk'och, of the schooner Abigal,
of Boftciv, is arrived here from Malaga,after
a pafifage days. When capt. Gooch
was : t G 'brr.ltar, on the 29th of Septem

merchant, Mr. Anderfon, that he had
that day received several letters from
France, containing very interesting intel
ligenceâthat the combined armies had
been engaged in a general action with
me of the French armies ; the enemy
confiitcd of ;â¢ 0,000 men ; the number of
French was not mentioned. The flatigh
ter on both fides was very great, anil the
battle .terminated in favour of the patriots
âfor the enemy was forced to retreat, and
the French kept the field. It was said
the enemy expected to be reinforced by a
jundlion with the Ruffian troops. It was
;ilfo mentioned, that the king of Spain
was raising troops, stid intended to fend
an army of 60,000 men to join the concert
or. princes. The Ruffians and Turks
have closed the articles of a peace. The
king and queen of Frrnce were llill in
prison. No further intelligence of the
marquis tic ia Fayette. "The alternative
adopted bythis virtuous soldier was dread
ful to his filings. He mr.fl either have
defended himfelf by force, and ruined his
country, or he mull have become a facri
fice to the Pzople, whom he at firfl served
with the mo*: faithfula&ivity, and has since
effended error only; for Fayette is
certainly an honest patriot ; taut his pre

Some particulars rciativ* to' the interior parts oj
America [by Mr. lmlay s formerly of Ntw-Jer
fty. Continued from No. 104.]
THE frequent turnings in the Miflifippi pro
duce in every bend eddy water, which wit!
the advantage the wind affords (which blowing th<
greater pare of the year from the south-west, anc
directly up the windings of the river, which, by rea
son of the vacancy between the banks and lifinj
foroft: on either fÂ»ie, afford a channel for the cur
rent of the air) )sSufficient with fails, keeping ai
much as possible in the eddy water, to carry a boa
50 miles a day up the ft ream.
To account for those winds philofophicalli
be extremely easy } but, as it is a circum
llance notorious from the testimony of voy3gers ir
the Mifiifippi and Ohio, the test of ex
perience will be prefeired to any philosophical di(-
quifition upon the fubjeft.
Should this navigation prove too tedious, anc
no improvements appear likely to be made in it
the importing into the country may be faciiitatec
by another channef, from the Gulph cf Mexico
up the Mobile, which is a lazy current j from the
principal branch of which there is but a fliort pas
sage to a branch of the Tenefi'ee, when you wil
have the advantage or the stream quite into th<
Ohio. I have enumerated th-is circumftanc<
tnerely for the fake of information, for I have not
the smallest doubt of the eligibility of the naviga
tion of the Mifiifippi, which is proved from the
experiments which are daily making.
The distance from Pittfburg to the Mufkingum
js 173 miles 5 to the Little Kanhaway 17851 c
the Great Kanhaway 285 ; to Great Sandy 342 ;
â¦o the Sciota 3905 the Limestone 500 5 to the
Little Miami 510 j to Licking creek 524 5 to th<
Oreat Miami 550 ; to the Great-bone creek
582 ; to the Kentucky 626 ; to the Rapiers 703 j
to Salt river 723 jto Green river 922 5 to tfce
"Wabafh 1019 jto Cumberland river 1113 ;to the
Teneffee 1F26; to the Mifiilippi 1183 ; from
thence to New Orleans is about 1200.
It is about 230 miles from the mouth of the
Ohio up the Miflifippi to the mouth of the Mifou
yi, and about 20 from thence to Illinois* which is
navigable for batteaux to its source* From
thence there rs a portage only of 2 miles to Chick
ago, whkh is elfo navigable for batteaux to its
entrance into lake Michegan, which Is a distance
Â©f 16 miles. This lake affords communication
with the liver St. Lawrence through Lake
faffing Niagara by a portage of 2 miles, Tm
Jake Erie and Michega* are na?lgalle for vessel?
drawing 6 and 7 feet water. This is one of th<
routes by which the exchange of commodities be
tween the northern and fovthern parts of this em
pire will be facilitated.
In continuing the plan of intercourfc, it will be
found extremely easy to pass through lake Onta
rio to Wood creek, up Wood creek, and by a por
Uge of about 3 miles you arrive at a creek., waicn
in 3 miles more brings you to Fort Edward upon
[he Mohawk river, Ifrhich is a branch cf Huri
fon's river. There are federal carrying place?
between that and Its junction with Hudson ; bui
very little labour would remove them, and I havÂ«
no doubt but the state of Hew-Yorlt will be judi
cious enough to set early about it. It is certaii
that they have ordered surveys to be rr.ade, am
plans are forming for the removal of those ob
ftruttions. It has been long in embryo wit!
them. 11 was ir>Â»po-iiible a plan of so much utili
ty could escape that f;age and penetrating politici
an General Schuyler, whose vail estate lies mod!;
in that part of America.
There are also portages Into the waters of lak<
Erie from the Wabafh, Great Miami, Mufkin
gum, and AUeganv, from 2 to 16 miles. Ihi
portage between the Ohio and Potowmac will b(
about 20 miles when the in the Mo
nongahala and Cheat rivers aie removed, whid
will form the firft object of the gentlemen ofVir
yfinia when they have completed the canals cn tin
Potowmac.
The obftruftiotts to'the na-vigstion of the Grea
Kanhaway are of such magnitude, that it will re
quire a work of'ages to remove them 5 but if ever
that should be done, there will be an easy com
municatidn between that and James river, anc
likewise with the Roanoke, which runs through
But this is an event too re
mote to deserve any confederation at present.
A! 1 the rivers in this country of 60 yards vidt
and upwards, are navigable almost to sourc
es for flat-Â»bottomed boats during their floods, anc
for batteaux the greater part of the year, tin
great Kanhaway and little excepted. Th<
Tenafee has a considerable fall where it pasTe:
through Cumberland mountain, there muf
be a portage also. From thence it is rtavigabjk
quite to Holiton.
The rapids of Ohio "I have defcribeo in 2 for.
mer lettei. They are no obftru&ion in vas
ter to boats going down the river, and indeed bat
teaux may pa& aimoft at any t;me. 1 here ar<
two small rapids in the Wabafh between i .s mout}
and St. Vincent's, but they are no impediment tc
navigation, except at timer, of lew w.: ter. Ihi
Kafkafkia, is a small river which runs into tht
Miffifippi below the Illinois, and is navigable ;
r onfiderable way above the Plains 5 the Mifiifip.
pi is navigable to St. Anthony's Falls, without a
ny obflruftion. Carver dtferibes i: as navigabli
above them as far as he travelled. We have tc<
little knowledge of the Mifouvi to form any de
.ided opinion of the extent of its navigation. I
is however certain, that it is a more .power fu
than the Miffifippi, and in entering tha
river, it triumphantly rushes across, and its turbi<
.vatcrs, unmixed, seem to difdaina conneÂ£tior
â vith the clearer current of the other. An eaf
:cmnaunication again opens by JeÂ«Â»Â« fiorn th
Torthern Jakes to the head branches of the river
â¢vhich run into Hudson's bay into the Ar&ic re
ponsâand from the sources of the Mifouri int>
:he Great South Sea. Thus in the centre of th
:-arth, governing by the laws of reason and hu
nanity we seem calculated to become at once th
emporium and prote&ors of the world.
Before I finifli this letter, I (hull just erite* in
:<*> forne of the minutiie of the difttnee and tim
>f descending down the Ohio, which will serve so.
in account of all the other rivers. Mr. Jcfferfoi
Tasftated that " the inundations of the Ohio be
;in about the laftof March, and subside in July
Frequent rains in the latter end of th'
jutumn produce floods in the Ohio., and it i
*n uncommon season when one of those flood
ioes not happen before Christmas 'if there i
nuch frofty weather in the upper part? of thi
:ountry, its waters generally remain low unti
:h.-y begin to thaw. But, if the ri>er is not fro

ilways water fufficient for boats of any size frorr
November until May ; when the waters general
y begin to-fubfide 5 a-nd by the middle of Jun<
n moil seasons they are too low frr boats abovi

froft seldom continues so long as the middle o
February, and immediately upon its breaking th<
river is flooded } this flood may in a degree sub
side, but for no length of time 5 and it is froir
:hat period until May'that the boats generally
:ome down the river. The distance of defcend
ng is in proportion to the height of the water ;
but the average Jiftance is about eighty miles ir
: wen ty-four hours, and from sixty to one hun
ired'are the extremes; so that the mea:n time o:
joing in a flat-bottomed boat from Pittfburg tc
he Rapids, is between eight and nine-day-8, an:
jbcmt twenty cays more to New-Orleans : whici:
will make a pafiage from Pittiburg to that pla c <
â¢ early a month. The inundations cf the Miflj

Ohio j but it 13 very certain they begin in March,
ind subside in July. This i-s the most propei
rime to ascend the river, as you avoid the flioals.
lave finer weather, but above all, when the watei
s high, you have stronger eddies ; and with tak
ng the advantages, and with dexterous watermen]
you may proceed fifty miles * day which will
bring you back to the rapids of the Ohio in fort)
days, making a large allowance for contingencies.
1 rtiall take leave of you for th * piefent, with
observing, that the fmaiier rivers ftd'.e no stated
period to govern their inundations j but are fub
jeâ¬t to be Hooded by all heavy r*'ws, -which is 2
great advantage to the country, as it arrurds the
inhabitants frequent opportunitks of fending
their produce to the several markets upen tht
