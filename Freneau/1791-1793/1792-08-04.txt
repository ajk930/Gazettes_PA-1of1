FRANCE, May 14,
THE fallowing letter from Turin
gives a full cUid cucumflavl'wl narra
tive of the afTmys thnt have happened
this spring between the (Indents of the
university in that capital and the military
and mechanics of the fame place " Yoti
may recollect so have heard that for fomt
â¢timej,. 11, rr.nai I 9111; ago a the irontli
df Jui I '.', .tVar'm dffptiUs had
taken place between the (Indents of the
uni erfi'y in this city and the military of
ficers llationed here, and that the (Indent!
were honourable enough to refufe the as
fdlanee of the tradefmcn and mechanics
who were for incorporating themfelve!
with them on this occasion By their con
dutt they aflrgnted both military and me
chani s ; the former supposing theroft'lvci
insulted, by the uniform attempts of tlx
(ludents to repn-fs their insolence, and tlx
latter thinking their,(elves undervalued
because the llud. iitu would not make then:
. their aftbeiates in a quarrel with which
they had nothing t<* do. In confeq-uenct
of the advantages they had gained, ane
the medal the king hn l given t(iem as s
discriminating mark of their privileges
the (ludents conduced themselves ft
haughtily as to alienate the esteem nol
only of the lower clrdfei of the people, tuil
alio a largt ni:n be of refpeflab'e ci
tizens. Tin- military and ariftocratii
Noblefce new began to form schemes o
vengeance, and to set the ftudeuts
chanica at lo ;gerheads They even w-eul
so far ac to furm separate hoi'tile bodies oi
the (Indents,citizens,& merchants, thinking
in consequence of fucli divisions, to re
gain their ancient afeendancyx The exe
cution of this well concerted plan, lias pro.
ved the canle of the troubles of which J
am about to give you a relation.
On Sunday lalt a quarrel happened a
monj; a small number of (Indents and a bo
dy of artills and mechanics, refpedling the
right of the former to play at foot-ball 01;
a piece of ground adjoining the ram
parts, which had been appropriated to the
use of the (ludents for that purpose, for :
century pall, and the right to which hac
been confirmed to them by kiilij Cliarle*
Emanuel. In the course of the week the
fermentation en'creafed, and preparation;
were ojx nly made for the content ions thai
were to follow. The cardinal archbilhop,
upon this, summoned together the refton
and ptofefTors of the university and colle
ges, and recommended them to use then
utmofl endeavours to keep the flu lent;
within. These orders were executed will:
all poflible zeal On the Sunday follow
ing, the day fixed upon for the executior
of - the plot, fevt ral of the profeflors went
in company to the city gate, anJ requef
tcd filch (ludents as were there to return
to their apartments. In genera! the r.-
quest -was attended to, and all but a few
retired. In the mean time the mechanics
and tradefmcn were resorting in formida
ble companies to the place pitched upon
for the a(Tray. Vexed to find no enemy
to oppok them, they be.-an their exploits
by insulting some lawyers' cleiki who
were walking on the ramparts. They
then proceeded in d:fordcrly manner into
the town, and meetin.; a company of (In
dents, took away from them their difcri
initiating medal. On* of the rioters wai
fcized, just as he was committing this afl
of violence, by one of the king's grena
diers. This was no sooner done than a
immense crowd of people rudied into the.
callle square, formed themselves into a re
gular body, and with loud Ihouts and ine
usees, demanded the prifoiur, and threa
tenedtotake him by forcc if lie wa3 not
iuftantly given up.
As good fortune would have it, thr
Cardinal-Archbishop was at this time on
his way home from thÂ« palace. He iinme-

diatr.y ft opt his cirri.igr, addrefled tin
people in a pei fuafive ami yet forcible man
ner, and engaged that the prisoner fliouhl
In' given up to them. The affe&ion ol
the people for the character and person ol
thin prelate, gained, him lome attention,
nu) they agreed for the present not to as)
offcnfively. The Cardinal then went t(
the Governor's hoOfe, which he fount'
encircled by a great number of tradesmen,
demanding several of llnir friends to be
surrendered up, who had beui arrested al
ihc city-gate. ihe governor was answer
ing them in the tone of a man who wa
greatly frightened, in confeq.uence o
which they went off with a resolution tc
liberate their friends by force. Abonl
this time the commandant and'the tw<
Major generals arrived ; who inftantl)
igr<id that the prisoners hitherto madi
lliould be set at liberty, and that the gar
nfon Ihonld taicc arms to maintain tlx
peace of the city. This reltored ordei
for the present, and the night passed with
jut :iimult.
The calm, however, was not of loin
luiation. The next day, the tradefmer
l "d la! ourers, actuated by the fame mo
<"rs, be an to ailemble again in great
rowd's, in different quarters of the city
:i d towards noon met on Caroline square
It was now caly to fee that the tumult:
if this day were verging to infinitflj

jcfore. I he multitude announced alom
â¢ heir attention, to attack the
ollege, which was hard by, and put t(
:h< fvyord two,hundred Undents who wert
herein. This threat induced the govern
nent to give the necessary orders'tu pre
serve the public peace. ' At 2 o'clock
" ders were given to get ready the artil
ery. Jhe soldiery beat to arms, and
:he number of patrols was increased.â
Detachments of infmtry were llatior.ed
3li the avenues to the fqinre. and a picket
if cavalry rtear the college: but the riot
rs were before hand with them, having
dready begun to attack the college by
hrowing Hones at the windows and en
deavouring to built open the doors
i iie Undent's perceiving that they wen
lot effectual y fuccoied by the military]
iow took meafurcs for their own defenct
hey barricaded the doors, and mounted on
lie roof, from whence they poured down
)rkks, tiles, &c. upon the heads of the af
failaiits At this inllant M. de U Noye,
who had already proclaimed martial law
>n the spot, arrived at the college, at the
ie.id of a detachment of forty Artillery
nen. lie commanded the Undents, in
!hc name of the I'.ing, to quit the roof j
ind was obeyed : but the assailants did not
â o eaiily comply, but continued the attack.
Flic commandant then tried the means ol
lerfuaHon and gentle methods of diffua
iing the multitude from further violence,
i Ins was ineffectual. He then ordered
he troops to discharge over the heads of
hj rioters, which only fcrved to redouble
â¢leir audacity, as after this discharge they
mounded one of the foldier3 with a cutlass.
Hie commandant now ordered three or
our rounds tobe fired dirc&ly upon them
i wo men fell,dead,and a great number were
nortidly wounded j belides others, who
>vere all sent to the liofpical, molt of
them are li nee dead of their wounds.
This effedtually scattered the rioters,
and in a few minutes the streets were emp.
ty. Ihe garrison, however, were kept
under arms all night, during which several
eilorderly>)e:fons were apprehended and
sent to prison.
The insurgents rallied the A llowing day
in the suburbs of Ihe city, and made pre
para ions for blowing up the powder Tnag i
/.ire,and committing other outrages, which
however were all prevented by the judici
..us exertions of the O&cert of the milita

There are a number of circuit!(lances
which make it evident, that the noblefil

mow that a will governed country does
iot require alf its citizens to legifhte, but
that avail majority would he better em

drawn : and hence it is that this society
[the Jacobin] is at present, in a great
ineafurr, composed of dextrous gamblers
who are playing a game of hszaid, and

that they are the people. Tiiis opinion has
been generally embraced by popular ora

hundreds of idle fellows assembled in a gar

of banditti who meet for the express pur
pose of pillaging private property, have
the audacity to call themselves the people ;
and the molt infoleat despots have nevei
received more vile adulation from theii
courtiers, than that with which the usur

remarkable that there is not a city in
France more universally attached to the
revolution than Versailles, altho' it fufters

louJer voice than private distress.
Amongit other patriotic gifts made tc

Rome, April 16. <â¢ Nothing very inter
esting offers to teilyou at this time, unless
that the pope has loft his filler, the mother
of cardinal Onefti â Permit, me, however,
to give you a flight sketch of the quarrel
th,<t has for some time occasioned a cold
ness between the court of Rome and the
order of Malta, and which seems to be
increasing every day. Among the various
Catholic powerÂ», the order of Malta fuf
fers, perhaps, with the least patience, the
despotic authority exercised by the court
of Rome. The religious title assumed by
the order, has ever given the popes a han
dle to consider themselves as heads of the
order, and consequently to fubjeft them to
their own jurifdiftion. Hence come the
pretentions of the holy fee to nominate
the grand masters of Malta, the ele&ion
for whom is always so managed as to be
hurried over in less than threedays. Hence,
too, the pope's nuncios, under the title of
inquisitors, keep up a tribunal at Malta,
which is invested with exorbitant powers.
The local jurifdiftion of the insular billiop
is veiled with similar and equally extended
powers. These two powers are the con
ilaut enemies of the grand mailer, are per
petually opposed to his inclinations, and
are daily seducing the Maltese from the
authority of their prince by their letters
patent, and protections, often purchased,
and always illegal. The grand mailer has
demanded, that all sovereigns who feel
themlelves interested in the fate of Malta
shall combine to request of the pope the
suppression of thtfe two jurifdnftions, so
Celtruftive of the rights of sovereignty and
contrary to all good government. It is
not to be doubted that if Francc would
surrender up to the order of Malta her pro
perty in the island, as it is her interest to
do, it would be an effe&ual step in ena
bling the grand master to throw off the
papal yoke. Thegreat influence the French
knights have over the order, by reason of
this number, would facilitate such a revo
lution. From all appearances, the grand
master is about to make an attempt of this
kind, by his having begun to take ?way
certain of their privileges from t.he ecclefi
iitUcs of the iflaud ; but circumila.nces are
not so favorable as could be wliiied to over
turn the Rom n usurpations. The pope,
however, tiocs not pretend that the abridg
ed [which have connexion
with religion J were originally jure divino
lie has contented himfelf with inftriactiiia
his amb ffador at Malta to notify thÂ«
c;i and matter, that " if the suppress d pri
vileges are not rettoied, he will deprive tin
order of all the exemptions it enjoys with
in the territories of the church." It i;
now believed that the answer of the grant
matter will inform the holy father, that i
he takes away from the order of Malt;
the immunities it enjoys in other Catholic
countries, the grand matter, in his turn
will give orders to his fleet, cruifmg in tin
Mediterranean, no longer to protedl tht
coalb oi the ceclefk.iucal Hate from the
of Algerines, and other free
booting, Barbarians."
Observations on the English Mi
nistry.
[From a late French Paper.]
IT has been observed that the king ol
England is no more than an hereditary elec
tor and sole depositary of the executive
power, that is to fay, of the minillry. Tht
king of England is never a reigning king,
except at the moment when he is chilling
lis minillers. Theie only being charget
.vitli the refponfihility of government, tht
king is compelled to approve all their re
[oiutions, or to dilfolve them and make ;
new imnidry, which would lose him a ma
ority in both hoiifes of parliament. It i:
the minillers, then, that pofTefs, in reality,
the kingly power in Britain. But the ex
ecutive power has no energy, as managet
by them, because they conflitute a bod;
perfectly united, who deliberate in com
mon, and always are governed by the opi
nion of the majoiity, to the sense of whoir
every member, and fubordmate, mutt con
form. Hence it is that England not on!)
has minittcrs but a minillry. The lame
thing cannot be said of X' ranee. The ex
ecutive power will there be weak and in
effeÂ£lual, independent of all other causes
as long as the minillers shall Continue tt
be of divcrfe opinions and do not form ;
united body, always a&ing in concert.
The English minillry, by reason of iti
refponfihility, is assured of the entire de
votion and concurrence of all its fubordi
nates, who are bound to execute its orderi
with zeal and fidelity : And thus at the
change of every miniflry there is also a re
nevval of home appointments, as well a:
the appointments abroad. They leave not ii
place a single man attached to the old mi
nillry, or who entertains opinions differen 1
from their own. Hut even this does not fa
tisfy them. To prevent the king from de
ranging or counteracting their operations
the minillers do not fuffer him to be encir
cled by their declared enemies, the old mi
niflerial servants, or other ch'araf ers noi
abfolntely devoted to their exclusive intcrell
This is the reason that every new miniftr)
makes a thorough change in the king':
household, from the grand matter of tin
wardrobe to the fwabbevs of the kitchen
It is well remembered that when Mr. l'o>
;ame into the minillry, the king asked ii
is a particular favour that they wou d nol
"emove M. de Dorset, for whom he had treat
>reat personal regard. The very next day,
lowever, his majetty found himfelf undei
lie necessity of signing the commission th.it
jut into place the successor of his favouiite,

In justice to the young gentlemen \vh

The valedictory oration was very judici

The Nfw-York papers continue full on

ricks are loaded on both. \ve would not

vor of oik', to che difad vantage of tlie other
fas appears to be the cafe' with some) as we
respect the character of both gentlemen.
Gov. Clinton has ever been a (launch friend
to the republican interell ; and Judge Jay
is alio known to be a firm patriot. These
considerations lead us to decide With cau
tion, on the merits of this unhappy contro
verfv. We sympathize molt i'mcercly with
our brethren of New-York, that they art
involved in a conceit, which in its iiiue may
greatly endanger their peace and tranqui

sense of " the people" will lead them to adopt
fucli prudent measures, as will speedily re
tore uni'verfal harmony among the citizens.
When we trace the particular papers in
which are published certain particular account
in this bulinefs, we are apt to conjecture tha\

hat certain highjlj/os are improving this op

The following extract of a letter from ;

Another letter fays, " the genius of oh:
English hospitality is fled from tliisiSla-.il
and a poor fellow that Strays into tin
country in quell of work will be ten time
taken up and whipped for a vagrant, before
he once meets with employ. It was once
tlie glory of England tiiat a plentiful coun
try was given by heaven to a hospitable am!
cliaritabie people ; but, as Mr. Fuller Says,
good lioufe-keeping fetched its last groan
in Kent ; and there are small hopes It will
ever come to life again, whilst costly equi
pages and gundy liveries on idle fellows'
backs take away what was wont to be
laid out in filling empty bellies."
At a quarterly meeting of the Cbarlefton
library society, held on the nth of July,
Mr. Chancellor Hutfon delivered a miscel
laneous literary eflay, "in which were
difcufled, with extensive erudition, and
great ability, the existence of a Deity, the
Mosaic history of the creation, and the peo
pling of America. Mr. HutfÃti, at the re
quell of the society, will continue the fub
jeÂ£l at the next meeting."
On the 4th of July the anniversary of
American Independence was celebrated at
Dartmouth college, in New-Hamp(hire.
[n the forenoon there were various exhi
bitions by the Itudents, in public speaking,
music, &c. âall which were highly applaud
?d. In the exercises were
t>f a military kind, with a mock-battle, and
ather manoeuvres. After the conclusion of
the military display, a number of patriotic
:oafts were drank, and the day concluded
without disorder, accident, or irregula
rity.
By letters from Canada, as late as the
25th of June, we learn that " the election
if representatives to the lower House of
:he new legislature, was considerably ad
vanced at tljpt time. From a lift that has
leen publilhed, which not only {hews the
members already elected, but the number
:o which each county is entitled, it appears
[hat the House of Representatives will be
:ompofed of fifty-one members. " Much
corruption we understand has been prac
:iced 111 this election. Among the number
t>f representatives many are noblemen, and
"ome pofieffing manor rights founded upon
the custom of Paris. If this-ariftocratical
ntereft can be brought to co-operate with
[he legislative and executive council, of
which a number are to be ennobledâthe
"pirit of the government will be decidedly
iriftocratical, âthe reform of abuses need
not be expected,âoppreflion may produce
resistance, and a change in favour of equal
rights, and ajult representation."
On Sunday last arrived here from Charier
ton, the (hip Delaware, Capt. Art. Among
other paliengers was Major Butler, member
of the Senate of the United States, & Wil

A few days since, arrived in this river
from Hamburgh, the brig Catharine, with
upwards of one hundred and thirty pailen

countrymen in a short time
" The rath of October next (fays a paper
of Tliurfday) will complete three centuries
since the immortal Columbus put foot on
the new world. The citizens of America
fho'uld be reminded, with a view of coil
fulting them, refpefting the propriety of
commemorating the Columbian CentuAry
anniversary. Should not that day be cele
brated with due eclat, as a small tribute
from the grateful sons of Liberty, the native
fruit of a foil discovered by this admirable
ihilofophic navigator, who, through envy
and fraud, had not the honor of giving his
lame to his own discovery, though made at
the risque of hi life ? It (liould be remem
bered; that this is the firft centurial period
which has offered ilnceithe eftabliihment of
liberty, and before this bail revolves one
lundred times more through its orbit,
nUch of the lire of liberty may (poflibly) be
cxlinguifhed in the western world."
The friends of monarchical government
Tiould consider that war is an indifpenfible
ingredient in that system. It is remarkable
that in the history of the life of Charle
magne, this principle is openly avowed :
I impoTithl au maintien de I'autoriU du Roi, d'en
'.retcnir la Â«umc. i. e. -the King's authority
was to be kept up and supported by war.
On this fubjeil Mr. Barlow remarks, that
â¢' one general character will apply to much
the greater part o f " the wars of modern
time âthey are political and vindiÃivt. This
alone is fufficient to account for their real
origin ; they are wars of agreement rather
than of dilTention, and the objett is taxes
and not territory. Whenever the real se

' A lingular event (fays a late French pa

HONOR, like rclig on, is an prjginal indeli
ble lentimenc of the mind, an indifpenfa
b.e mgiedjenlin our nature. But its ot-jcel i
incapable of precise definition ; and confequentU
though Riven us ;n aid of the more definable fee]
'ngs of morality, it is capable of total peiverlion
ot lohng fight bf its own original nature, and flil
retaining its name j of pursuing the defti'udii r
ot moral sentiments, instead of being their ornl
nicne jot debating, inllead of supporting, the dig
nity of man, 5
1 his cameleon principle was therefore a p.-ooe,
clement ot imposition, and wa . de:l;ned to mA,
an nnmenfe ngure in the world, as the foundatio,
and lupport of the military fyllem of all unequa
governments. We mult look pretty far into hu
nun nature, before we iliall discover the c iulc
why killing Â«Â«â¢ In battle Ihould be deemed,,,
ujcJ, an honorable employment. A hangman !â¢

not brcaufe the viflims in the former cafe a

would be a greater libel upon human society thai
J can bung myfelf to utter ; it would make th<
tyranny of opinion the mo/> detejfai'c, as well a
the mod sovereign of all poffibje tyrannies. Bu<
what can it be ? It is not, what is sometimes al
ledge., tnat courage is the foundation of the bu(l
-nels ; that lighting is honorable because it is dan
gerous } there is often as much courage difphyct
in nighway-roubery, as in the warmeit conflia o:
armies ; and yet it does no honor to the party :
liJ d is as difljonorable a character as .
Jack Ketch. It is not because there is anv ide.
of or bontjiy in the cafe ; for to fay the bef
that can be said or war, it is impossible that mor
ula,, one llde can be jult or honelf ; and yet both
tides ot every contelt a le equally the road to fame
where a diltrnguilhed killer of men is fore to gair
immortal honor. It is not fttriotifii, even ir
that sense of the word which deviates the mod
from general philanthropy ; for a total granger t:
both parties in a war, may enter into it on eichei
I'de as a volumes:-, perform more than a vulgai
thare ot the llaughter, and be forever applauded

pecuniary advantages that are ordinarily attache,
to the pruteliion ot arms; for soldiers are geiier-i.
ly poor, though part of their buiinefs be to plun
tier.
Indeed, I can fee but one reason in nature, wh\
the principle of honor Ihould be fdeded from al
human incentives, and relied on for the. fuppon
of the military system : ic is because it was ccnveâ 
nunc for cbt governing foiucr , that power being
in the hands ot a I'm-ll part of the commur.it'
whole business was to fupuort ic by imposition.
No principle ot a permanent natuie, whose ob

but no one cÂ«n define j it is therefore whatevci

Inree principal things. The bread, we are giver
!< und- inland, has a proportion ot allum in it,
Ihe n ilk, 1 am well informed, is often mixed
wth whiting and water. A person who livrc
with me lately as a fervanf, informed me flu
lodged at .1 iiouie once when our of place, wheic
lome mill: carriers had the lower apartments ;
tnat (he often heard a churn going, a.;d wonderec
at it, as noâ  butter was made by them. One dm
lie key bei-'g left in their door, and they out, (he
had curit.fity to go in, when (lie found a churn, ;
parcel ot whiting, and a pot with some in it, frcn:
whence Ihe gathered that whiting and watei
churned and boiled, was put into the milk; an,
Ihe afterwards took notice, the milk from th:
rows was brought home, and soon a.'ter much
more carried out, smoking hot. And now as tc
the lugar, the (hips going out to our We't-lndi:
Hands carry out hogftieads of lime, foi they fa,
the futjar will not granulat withouie lime, and i
is we.l known our sugar ltfincis use lime i,i th.
refining of sugar. Now, with the allutn in th:
aread, the whiting in the milk, and the lime ir
:ne (ugar, is it to be wondered so many disor
ders attend them in the stomach and bowels ?'j
doubt not many infants are yearly facrificed there
by- It is a thing which calls aloud for public
enquiry â until then I can only point out a me
thod to be pursued by all parents who legard theii
r.fantsâthat every mother suckle her own chil
â  :en, and when weaned, feed them with flowc:
and water boiled, and a little butter in it, and a
r.nall proportion of animal food, abllaining from
medicines of all forts, unless ordered by a fkilfu
; orhccary, and I am peifuaded the lives of many,
r. lall v infants, will be preserved thereby. ]
