For the NATIONAL GAZETTE, j
A Political enquiry into tin bejl means of
improving the Commerce of the
Arncrican States.
[Concluded, frtm our lajl. j
TO whatever quarter we turn our
view, we fliall copftantly find,
that the civilized nations of antiquity
were invariabiv employed in inventing
and perfecting such. arts as were of moL
use to mankind. From a careful inspec
tion into the works or nature, both ani
mals and infeCts have been made to con
tribute to the necessities ot life. Expe
riments made upon the hair of goats,
firft showed the practicability of fabri
cating that ftuff at present known by
the name of Camblet, of which such im
mense quantities are now in common
use ; and the pearl oyftsr has given rife
to almost as extenlive a commerce as the
fabric of fiik.
I am aware of one objection that will
be made to the cultivating of the arts in
their full extent in America. The po
pulation of the dates, it is said, will
loon be so considerable, that it mult
iwallow up all the produce of the home
manufactures, as well as thole of Eng
land-. , . ... â¢
I allow that the population will in
tittle be immense in the United States.
Such is the extent and happy situation
of this countny, so well is it adapt
ei-to the multiplication of the human
race, both from, the fertility of its foil,
and the nature of its government, that
it is easy to forefee the exigence oi
countlcfs millionfcia that prodigious ex
teut cf territory known t>y thv iraiat oi
the United Sta'tes.
I allow, also, that there will be con
stantly a very brisk demand for every
fnecies of manufacture, that we now fee
carried on in Europe. But, at the fame
time it is evident, that this country
can never fuffer Great-Britain to entei
into a competition with her, in regard
to what is manufactured on this fide tht
water. The enterprize and induflry o
the British nation will, if that is allow
e-i always find means to baffle Amenc
both in her manufactures and commerce
This is a truth that might eahiy b- pro
ved, and a hundred arguments migh
be brought to oppole a contrar
opinion : At present, however, I wil
confine myfelf to the quoting a .ew ai
ouments from an approved author.-
Â° " The unlimited importation (lays he
of articles from foreign countries, o
the lame kind with those manufacture
in the importing country, is perniciou
to national induitry. Every year a vai
quantity of merchandize is imported in
to France from the Indies, over am
above what the nation consumes. Th
defifnofthis surplus of importation 1
to en l'ure a profit to the nation upoi
re-exporting, and re-felling or In
dia manufactures, which lome othc
commercial nation would not fan ot leiz
inor upon, fliould France dimmish he
imports of this nature merely to th.
quantity wanted within the kingdom.
The fame author observes, in anothe
placeâ"The commercial treaty con
eluded between England and Portugal
for supplying the latter with woolen
and other Ruffs, does not fail to lmpo
verifli the Portuguese. Unaer colou ;
of th,t tieaty, England has monopoli
zed their trade to such a degree, tha,
their own manufactures, eftabhfhed lr
the kingdom, cannot (land in any fori
of competition with those of Great-Bri
tain. And so immense is the quantity
of British goods consumed in Portugal
that they are not near paid for by a re
turn of the commodities of the country
_so far from that, it is computed tha
they pay a balance yearly to England o.
more than thirty millions,* in gold frorr
Brazil, besides having their national
jnanufa&ures ruined in the baigain.

By PHILIP PRE NEAU
T II U R S D A Y, December I, 1791.
France has experienced fimiiar loffcs.
from her treaty of commerce with Eng
land. The importation of English good:
in a short time ruined several branches
of her manufa&ures ; and it is eviden:
that the few' manufacturing establish
ments at present existing in the Unitci
States will experience a like fate, i
remedies are not Ipeedily provided.
There are still two important conn
derations to be taken into view rtlativ
to improvement in manufa&ures, am
the economy that is necelfaiy to mak
them flourifh.
The firft of these is, the ner.eflity o
appropriating each particular branch o
manufafturc to a number of artists o
different ages, as is the practice at Lon
don, for the fake of faviÂ»g expence ii
hiring of hands. Aconftar.t repetitioi
of the fame work, makes the worknai
more dextrfus and ready than he v/oul
other wife He ; and in many inflance
even children may be beneficially em
oloyed at a small expence. It isfromthi
economy in point of wages to workmen
that the English can alio id to fell tlv
best goods, of different qualities, at ;
cheaoer rate than other nations ; tin
competition of whom, they, by lucl
means, generally destroy.
The other consideration, and whicf
merits the moil particular attentior.
from persons that engage in eftabhili
ments of this nature, is an enquiry inu
tile cost. of workmanship, which oughi
;ver to be in. proportion to the price o
provilions and other necelfaries of lde
From an attention to this general rule
we shall soon perceive that manufac
;ures, in general, can h-rdly be expeÂ£t
to fucccc-i to anv ; !: 1 c
n the neighborhood of the coast, orir.
he several sea-ports of America, where
jrovifions arc dear, and wages, in gc
leral, high. A inanufafturer who efla
jlifhes his works an hundred and twen
y or thirty mil6s in-land, where provi
ions are cheap, will find himfclf inlen
ibly growing rich ; whilst another, whe
ets up his manufacture in a fea-pori
â own, where markets and wages arc
-igh, will in a ihort time experience
;ertain ruin. The reason iseviuentl)
his : the low priccs of food and laooi
"yield so much clear profit, and thus con
.ributeprincipally to make the ettabiiin
merit flourifh.
And hence we may conclude witr
:ertainty, that, to ensure success in en
erprizes of this nature, manufa&orie:
jueht always to be established in thf
nterior parts of the United States, aboul
he heads of navigable rivers, 111 ordei
o facilitate the exportation of their fa
brics. . . .
From all that I have said, it is appa
rent, that the government lies unde:
an urgent necessity to cast a favorabu
Â»ve upon the growing industry of thi.
country. The possibility of doing some
thing I have fully proved. Surely, then
the general powers of adminiftratior
will not be backward in applying then
most solid support to the fair edifice o
liberty, by encouraging national in
dustry. This is the path to profpen
t y the basis of power âand the mean
to render perpetual the glory of this ex
tensive empire.
Much more might have been laid or
this fubjeft ; and it is the intention o
she author to make some additional rc
marks, when he can do it'with propr.
Etv. If his observations should be tho
ie'ferving of attention, he hopes some
oerfon will take the pains to publift
'hem in the language of the country
in d he will feel peculiar fatisfaOion n
he idea of the probability of his havins
sentiments that may be ot uii
io the public of the United States.

According to the order of the dav
the house, in committee of the whole
Mr. Muhlenberg in the chair, proceed
ed to consider the bill for the relief 0
widows, orphans, and invalids, in cer
tain cases.
In debating on this fubjeft, Mi
Fitzfimons exprÂ»fled his doubts of th
propriety of proceeding in the bill be
idre the committee ; and propofedage
neral law to be enacted to fatisfy th
claims of such widows and orphans, a
had not- been provided for by the par
titular states, notwithftandingthe ait o
limitation. He saw no necellity of ex
arnining into every particular cafe in
tended to be provided for by the bill
which lie tÃought might be done full a
well by a general law, and therefor
made amotion that the committee Ihoult
rife.
Mr. Hartley thought a general lav
could not provide for every particula
cafe mentioned in the biliâand Mr
Wadfworth conceived, that a genera
law would open too wide a door to ap
plications. He thought it better to fin
ifh with the bill, and make the fevera
individual provisions, than lay the trea
fury department open to endless appli
cations, which would certainly be th<
effect of a general law ; and after all, ii
cafe of the enaftipn of a general law, i
was plain that many special cases in thi
bill would remain wholly unprovidei
for.
Mr. Sedgwick wished justice to bi
done to every individual claimant, bu
thought that house was not the place t(
examine into the minute particulars o
private claims. He exprefled his wifl
that, in the present instance, certaii
principles might be eftablilhed by thi
house, the execution of which fhouk
be left to the treasury officersâShoulc
this prove ineffectual, the house migh
then, and not till then, undertake thi
examination of private claims.
Mr. Goodhue, thought it would bi
fufficient to declare, that the claims o
widows and orphans should not be as
fefted by the ast of limitation; ant
therefore was in favor of general regu
lations.
Mr. Lawrance and Mr. Hillhoufe
give it as their opinions, that the com
mittee {hould proceed in the bill befon
them.âThe leveral claims of the appli
cants had been stated, and their paper:
examinedâall that remained, then, wa:
to decide thereupon. The persons thai
had applied for relief, were indigent,
and lay under heavy neceffitiesâln re
gard to them, therefore, they wished the
bill should be gone through with, th,at
the persons concerned might know
what they had to expect. As to appli
cation of this kind in future, it might
be prevented by general regulations,
hereafter to be madeâif the bill was
pa(Ted into a law, it would establish
precedents equal in their effects to the
operation of a general law, and would
direÂ£i the public offices in fettling
claims made after palling general regu
lations.
- After some further observations on
this fubjeft, the motion for proceeding
no further in the bill was withdrawn,
and the committee proceeded to the fur
ther consideration thereof.
The report of the Secretary at Wat
on the particular applications was then
read, considered, and decided 011â
when the bill was reported with feverJ
amendments.
A meflage was received from the Se
nate, by Mr. Otis, communicating a
bill palled by that house, entitled, At.
ail concerning Confab and Vice-Cor/uts.
Adjourned.
For the National Gazette.
IN Air. Fenno's paper of the 23d inft
I read a proposal for dividing tht
whole territory of the United States intc
diltrifts of 30,000 inhabitants each, foi
the purpose of a more full reprefentatioi
of the people in Congress.
I will lay nothing of the inconveni
encies and difficulties that muffc atteiK
the execution of such a project in tht
present fluctuating state of populatior
in tms country, which is every day ft
visibly affc&ed both by emigration au<
immigration. I will Yuppole all thef<
objections lurmounted, the member
eletted, leated on the federal floor, anc
juftbreathing after a warm debate, whilt
the clerk of the house of reprefentativft
calls the veas and nays on some impor
tant, national question.âLet us then fÂ«Â«
what effect our amendment will product
in the political balance.
By the repreferttation bill, withoi!
the writer's amendment, the whole
number of representatives will be 112
allowing for South-Carolina 140,00.
iree inhabitants, and 110,000 slaves
which is well known to be pretty neai
the truth, and will give that liate (
membeis. Of those 112, Vermont, N
Hampshire. Maine, Massachusetts, R
Island, and Connecticut, will furnifl
30 ; New-York, New-Jersey, Pennsyl
vania, Delaware and Maryland, 40
and Virginia, Kentucky, N.' Carolina
S. Carolina and Georgia, 42. But b)
the proposed diviiion of the Unitec
States into diftriÂ£ts, the New-Englanc
Hates would furnilh 34 members, the
middle Hates 42 ; and the foutHcn
states 44.
To prove this, we need but look intr
the schedule of the census, in which wi
will find, that New-England (calcu
lating the slaves according to the ratk
prescribed by tlie constitution) contain:
1,007,963 inhabitants ; and will there
fore, after eleftmg 33 members, have ;
surplus of 17,963 inhabitants, who com
ing to vote againfl 12,037 inhabitant
of the state of New-York, will create ;
decided majority, and thus give New
England an additional member,
her number, as already stated, 34. It
calculating the freemen and slaves in th<
other states, after the fame manner, tht
representation will be found as I hav<
apportioned it ; and there will remair
'.n Georgia some thousands of inhabi
Lants n'ho zciU have no vote at all.
Tofhew at one view the increase o
power and conference, which the
New-England states would gain by thi:
rlivilion into diftrifts, and how great ;
diminution the reft of the union'wpulc
luffer. we have only to use a veiv firrt
pic arithmetical process. and reduce tht
different portions of representation tt
fractions with one common denomina
tor. By this it will appear, that, o
840 equal parts, into which we wil
(uppofe the whole power and influenct
of the United States to be divided, tht
portions will be thus differently allottee
by the representation bill, and by tht
amendment above mentioned :

These more remote parts of the date of New-
York have gained much by the American revo
lution, in favor of the people. Formerly this
vast extent of territory was parcelled, out into
manors, lordlhips, and patroon-ibips, [he property
of the well-born, who were making rapid ft riles
towards enslaving an honed and laborious peaian
tiv, in the fame manner as in Germany and some
other countties of Europe. This was ihe cause
u! lo valuable a territory being retaiped so long
in a date of nature; few people, before the revo
lution, having been willing to hold lands under
a Iptcies of tenure, little Ihortof the feudal, and,
therefore, lettled 111 Pctinlylvania and other pro
vinces, where lands could be purchased at an
easy rate, and poflefled in fee.
Upon looking through European hifiory for
a century or two pal), it is really aflomlhin-J to
observe how mankind have fuffered theinfefves
to be led quietly in ccclefiaflical trammels, with
out once conceiving therafelves at liberty to
think agreeably to ihe powers of reason vithin
them. Owing to these flavifli fvdems, the vi
gor of the human mind has been loft, and the
noblefl flights of genius into the regions of science
and wisdom, prevented. Ho w often must everv
readet of biUbry have regretted to fee in some of
the firft w.iters of Europe, a forced fubmiffiori
to the national creed, which checked them in
ihe happiefl attempts of extending found judg
ment and undtrflanding, and probably induced
them to conceal what might have, done' ji6rtor to
ihe caule of truth and humanity. Boileau was
perhaps, one of the rr.ofl elegant writers, un
doubtedly the correflefl critic of the French na
tion; but it is humiliating to observe what pains
he was at to faiisfy ihe clergy, rel'pe&ing one of
bis pieces, and by way of apologizing for some
itttle matters he had advanced, in Ipirit rather
Iree, and of a gayer turn, naming this, and the
ather archbishop, or biTnop, why, on pcruGng
ins manufcupts, had found no fault, nor seen in
them any dogma, contrary to the eflaMifhed re
gion.âEvery man, of but very limited reading,

â  , chief Secretary of the order of St. Frgn
< J published an estimate of the number

iroer previous to the revolution ; and has fixed
t to three hundred thousand, in Europe. Belides

Monks, exclusive of thofewith gifted habits.
Each oftbele drones of society were maintained,

lundied livres a year ; so that according to this
dfimate, which is certainly modeiate, the pub
'r u' uro P an annual tax for the support
if the Mendicanis only, of about one hundred
md twenty millions. A tenth part of these

I he people in this capital regard the abolition

, Some attempts have been made to propel boats
uy forco of fceam. The power of fleam is
certainly prodigious, and there can be but little
doubt of its anivvcring this desirable objedt, if pro
perly appl-cd. Hitherto the machinery made use
ct has u-'.n complex, occafiouing much fricftion
and wanting frequent repairs : Bcfules, the force
has been applied to give motion to paddies; where
by powei has -always"been Intheiirft
experiments, the force was applied to turning an
axis which carricd a number of paddles as radii.
a. t.izs mode of proceeding, power was loft : For
when the paddle began to a6t on the water, it aÂ«st
ed obliquely; tending but in a small degree tn
propel the boat, but chiefly, only to lighten it. In
tins manner ol operating, the paddle, in the pro
gress of its motion, produced more and more ol
its desired effed, until it acquired a perpendicular
position, at which point only for an inflant, all
irs ,orce a&ed in propelling ; after which, while
emerging, its propelling power decreased, and it.'
action tended more and more to fink the boat
deeper. I o avoid this misapplication of power
a more complex and unweildv machine was con
llrucled, in which the paddles dipped into the wa
ter perpendicularly; when operating, adled alto
gether in propelling, and emerged also in a per
pendicular position. This contrivance had its in
convenience. While the paddle was immergiiij
and emerging, it opposed a considerable fur face t(
the ail ion of the water, and checked the progref
of the boat.
Dr. Franklin, in the year 1785, planned a Cm
pie method of applying fleam to give motion tc
boats. He propolcd, that the fleam ihould ac
immediately upon a piston, which should move ii
a cylinder, perpendicularly fixed in the centre o
the boat. The bottom of this cylinder, conneilec
with a horizontal .cylinder fixed from bow t(
stern, and there communicating with the surround
ing â water. Two valves in the horizontal cylin
der, on each fide of the perpendicular one, cacf
opening towards the flern. ' When in this fimpl<
machine the piston rose by the force of steam, tin
bow valve would open and the water rush in with
considerable force, fill it, and alio the perpendicu
lar cylinder. The pition would then descend, the
bow valve shut, that nearefl the stern open, and
the body of water rulh through the after part ol
the horizontal cylinder and out, with considera
ble violence, againfl the surrounding fluid, and
consequently propel the boat.
He conceived also, that when the piston as
cended, the boat would acquire a small quantity ol
motion, by water being fucked in at the bow,
These cylinders he proposed should be of a consi
derable diameter, the exa<ft size to be fixed by
experiment ; and fuggefled the propriety of doub
ling the apparatus, the pistons to work alternately.
The simplicity of this contrivance, and the little
friction which it would occasion, are considerable
recommendations t:f it; but a striking objetSlion
to this is a waste of power. The whole force ol
the water rushing out of the stern, would not tend
to propel the boat, as the surrounding fluid would
not oppose an absolute refiflancc to the column of
water ailing on it.
The following is proposed as free from the ob
jections to tiie above contrivances.
Let the steam ast in turning an axis bearing a
number of thin metal vanes, fixed like the vanes
of a windmill in the proper angle, and let these
vanes ail under water at the bow or stern of the
boat, as m.dt convenient. 1 y the rotatory mo
tion of the axis, the vanes would all continually
screw themselves into the water and give motion
to the boat. All the power would here propel the
boat, and the continual a&ion of the vanes give
the advantage of accelerated motion, it might
perhaps be found more convenient to apply the
iorce to two setts of vanes, fixed one on each fide
of the boat: this might, without much complexity,
be done.
An acftual experiment gave rife to this idea.
At the time balloons were in vogue in France,
and all heads were at work in devising means to
give them motion ad libitum, an ingenious mecha
nic, to the bow of a common boat, adapted four
vanes like those of a windmill, but smaller, and
gave motion to them by means of a simple crank.
The boat thus equipped, by the action of the vanes
on the air crofted the Seine in less time than ano
ther crofted the fame river by the means of a
pair of common oars, and returned from the eppo
iite shore to the place from which she started, not
withstanding the force of the current.
By extra(ss of a letter from Aux-Cays, to a
merchant in this city, we learn, that there is'al
mofl a total stagnation of business; that flour was
felling at five dollars, and moil other things in pro

The BOUILLIEB.
The king of Sweden ii not contented with tjÂ«
ting the Jsouillies; father and son, into his fer.
ice, but has. caused his acceptance of them to
: thus noticed in the Stockholm Gazette :
" In confluence of the diftinguilhed quaii
.es and military (kill, which the marquis de Bou
lle, formerly general of the army in the service
I France, has long j and but of re
peit to the attachment which he has lately fliewn
o the king and queen of Fiance and to their fa
r.ily, his majesty has tiken the marquis into his
ervice, and has granted him the rank of ljeuten
nr-jrneral, with priority, according to the date
if Ins brevet as a French general. His son count
jouis Joleph de Bouille, former'y lieutenant-co
onel of the Fiench Cavalry, is appointed aide
le-carnp to the king, and|appointment. *'cr both
lave been assigned in the extraordinary lift."
Thus intemperately and uninvited does the
ting of Sweden display hit enmity to the new con
litution of France,
To mark the ingratitude of such conduij, it is
icceflary to (late, that, during "the time when
he crown of France oifourfed the earnings of the
leople, this monarch leceived from them the an
lual salary of 2ffio,oool. To shew its indecency, it
s enough to llate, that he never has been invited,
>r authorised by any complaint from the French
ting, to utter an opinion concerning his (Ttuation.
There is in this a fort of peremptory violence
vhich is seldom confident with jultice, a degree of
letulant resentment which is beneath a great man
pon any occasion. He adopts a Genei al, whom
he existing government of another country de
lated a traitor; and he (hews difrefpefl to a peo
ple, whom he dares not attack, knowing very weH
hat they are attending too seriously to their Own
lappinefs to think of attacking him.

The BANISHED MAN.
[The felloiuingis founded upon some ideas of Lord
Bjlingbroke"i y 'written a little before bis sentence
of exile into France.âSee his Works. J
SINCE Man may every rfegion claim,
And Nature is, in all, the lame,
And we a part of her wide plan,
Tell me, what makes the Banifti'd Man ?
The favorite spot, that gave us birth,
We fondly call our Mother Earth j
And hence our vain diftin&ions grow,
And man, to man becomes a foe.
That friend/hip to all nations due,
And taught by reason to pursue,
That Jove, which (hould the world combine*
To country, why do we confine ?
The Grecian Sage (old (lories fay)
When queltion'd where his country lay,
Ihfpir'd by heaven, made no reply,
But rais'd his finger to the Iky.
No region has on earth been known
But some, of choice, have made their ownâ
Your tears are not from reason's source,
If choice can take the path of force.
il Alas ! (you cry) that is not all ! .
44 My former friendships I recall,
â¬t My honfe, my farm, my days, my nights,
" Scenes vanifh'd nowâand past delights."
Distance for absence you miftake â
Here days and nights their circuits make j
Kere nature wa'k3 her beauteous round,
And friendlhip may, perhaps, be founi.
)f times grow dark, or wealth retires,
Let reason check your fond desiresâ
Miftrs had never gold to spare,
And loss of wealth is lof* of care.
Thus, half unwilling, half refign'd,
Desponding why the generous mind ?â
Think rightânor be the hour delay'd
That flies the fur. to seek the piade.
Tho* injur*d, exil'd, or alone,
Nobly presume the world your own,
Convinc'd that, since the world began,
Death only makes the* Banijhd Man.
ORIGINAL ANECDOTE.
A gentlemen, desirous of exhibiting ftrikinj
proofs of his exuberant imagination and pompou
language, was paying a very lenfible and amiabli
young lady some very far fetch'd compliments
comparing her to the fun in its meridian glory
and himfelf to a dim taper, glimmering faintly be
fide it j forgetting in the mean while, to show com
mon pclitenefs to the lady, by whose fide he fat

him, and while he lifted off his hat, said, " Sir

Says he, " Mil's Anna, like Sol's splendid ligh

Philadelphia, Nov. 30, 1791*
LONDON.
If it is askedâWhat is the French Revolutioi
to us?âWe answer, It is much.âMuch to us a
â¢men â¢. Much to us as E-nglilhmen.
As men, we rejoice in the freedom of twenty
five millions of our fcliow men. We rejoice ii
the profpe#, which such a magnificent exampl
opens to the world. We congratulate the Frencl
nation for having laid the axe to the root of ty
ranny, and for eredting government on the facrec
hereditary rights of man.âRights, whicl
appertain to all, and not to any one more thar
to another. We know of no human authority
superior to that of a whole nation : and we pro
. fefs and proclaim it as our principle, that ever)
nation bas, at all times, an inherent, indefeafibl.
right to constitute and eftabli/h such governmen
for itfelf as best accords with iti uifpofition, in
tereft and happiness.
As we alforejoice, because we ar<
immediately interfiled in the French revolution.
Wi'thout inquiring into the justice, on eithei
fide, of the reproachful charges of intrigue anc
ambition, which the Engliih and French court:
have conftaatly made on each other, we confinc
ourselves to this observation :âThat if the couri
,of France only was in fault, and the numerous
wars which have diftreifed both countries are
chargeable to her alone, that court now exists nc
longer j and the cause and the consequence mufl
cease together. The French, therefore, by the
revolution they have made, have conqaered for us
as wellas for themselves } if it be true, that their
court only was in fauJt, and ours never.
On this state of the cafe, the J'rench revolution
concerns us immediately. We are oppressed with
a heavy national debt, a burthen of taxes, and an
expensive administration of Government; beyond
those of any people in the world. We have alfc
a very numerous poor : and we hold, that the
moral obligation of providing for age, helpless in
fancy and poverty, is far superior to that of sup
plying the invented wants of courtly extravagance,
ambition and intrigue.
We believe there is no instance to be produced,
but in England, of seven millions of inhabitants,
which make but little more than one million of
families, paying yearly seventeen millions of taxes.
As it has always been held out by all adminif
tratio/Hj that the restless aiubitiwa of the court of
France rendered this expcnce neccfury to us fat
jur own defence ; we consequently rejoice as mei;
ieeply interefled in the French revolution : foi
;hat court, as we have already (aid, exiits no long
;r ; and consequently the fame enormous exper.ee:
need not continue to us.
Thus rejoicing, as wefinccrely do, both as mei
and Englishmen, as lovers of universal peace ant
freedom, and as friends to our own national prof
ueritv and a redu&ion of our public expences : \v<
:annot but exprels our astonishment, that an;
>art, or any members of our own government
Should reprobate the extinction of that very paw
ir ill France, or wifii to fee it restored, tp whof
nfluence they formerly attributed (whilffc they ap
jeared to lament) the inormous increase of ou
>wn burthens and taxes. What then, are the
"orry that the pretences for new opprellive caxes
Â»nd the occasion for continuing many old taxes
vill be at an end ?âlf foj and if it is the polic
>f courts and court-government to prefer enemie
o friends, and a system of war to that of peace
is affording more pretences for places', offices
jenfions, revenue and taxation, it is high time so
he people of every nation to look with circum
pe&ion to their own interelts.
Those who pay the expences, and, not those win
Participate in the emoluments arifmg from it, ar
he persons immediately irtterelted in enquiries o
his kind. We are a part of that national body
>n whom this annual expence of seventeen mil
ions falls j and we Consider the present opportu
lity of the French revolution, as a molt happy on.
or lessening the enormous load, under which thi
lation groans. If this be not done, we iliall tnei
lave reason to conclude, that the ery of intrigci
md ambition against ether courts, is na more thai
he common cant of ail couits.
We think it also neceiTary to express our afto
lifhment, that a government desirous of bein;
ailed free, should prefer connexions with themoi
lefpotic and arbitrary powers in Europe. W
enow of none more deserving this description, thai
hose of Turkey and Prtjfiia, and the whole com
>in3tion of German despots.â Separated as w
lappily are by nature from the tumults of the con
inent, we reprobate all systems and intrigue
vhich facrilice (and that too at a great e;:pence
he blefiings of our natural fituatian.-âSuch fyf
ems cannot have a national origin.
if we are asked, what government is ?âWi
lold it to be nothing more than a national ajj'ocia
ion, and we hold that to be the belt, which fe
:ures to every man his rights, and promotes th'
;reateft quantity of happiness with the least ex
>ence.
We live to improve, or we live in vain ; an<
herefore we admit of no maxims of governmen
>r policy, on the mere score of antiquity, or othe
nen's authonty,the old whigs, or the new.
We will exercise the reason with which we ar
;ndued, or we polfefs it unworthily. As reafoi
s given at all times, it is for the purpose of beinj
jfed at all time>.
Among the blefiings which the French revolu
:ion has produced to that nation, v/e enuraerat
:he abolition of the feudal system of injulticu an
:yranny, on the 4th of August, 1789. BeneatJ
[he feudal system all Europe has long groarved
and from it England is not yet free. Game-laws
Borough-tenure?, and tyrannical monopolies,Â©
numerous kinds still remain amongit us : but re
oicing, as we lincerely do, in the freedom ofothers
:iil we shall happily accomplilh our own, we in
enued to commemorate this prelude to the uni
â¢ erÂ» a 1 extirpation of the feudal system, by meetin

*ere prevented by the interference of certain un
earned and fculking persons with the master of th
.avernj who informed us that on their reprefenta
:10ns he could not receive us.âLet those who liv
ay, or countenance feudal opprefiions, take th
eproach of this ineffectual meanness and coward
ce to themselves. They cannot ftifle the decla
ration of our honest, open, and avowed opinions.
These are our principles, and thele our fenti

hat require no fucn riotous aid. We'have 110
hing to apprehend from the poor j for we ar
pleading their cause. And we fear not o
jppreflion j for we have truth on our fide.
We fay, and we repeat it; that the French re
/oluticn opens to the world an opportunity, a
vhich all good cit.rens must rejoice $ that of pro
noting the general happiness of man, and, iruxxe

aufes, which have brought this country to its
â¢resent exalted and unrivalled situation. While
he improvements of the public roads and the cre
ition of immense aquedudts, have shortened the
aborious communication of real commerce â¢
vhile the universal confidence of fictitious com -
nerce, has removed in many cases the neceility <jf
uch weighty communication in pra&ice ; tile
lews-papers have given wings and light to every
hing. The value of all things is known in ail
:laces j private correspondence is shortened, and,
ometimes made fuperfluous j distances are re
noved j doubts are clcaied up, and the fame
knowledge of every bargain, every offer, ever}
wifli isdiffufea with the lame certainty and clear
ness over the whole kingdom, as the petty tranl
adions of a village are made known by the mo
t notonous proclamation of a bell-man. So fai
I their operation extends as to trade and the rea
concerns of life j but when we consider them in
censorial capacity, we lhall be still more astonish
ed at their effett. Iris well known that a cenfo
rial power is only another word for public opinio
it cannot exist without it. When the republi
of Rome ended, the emperors wished to retain tn
cenforfliip, and it was often revived, but alway
without effed. Pqblic opinion w-as corrupted
fliamc had loft its blufli ; no pÂ«rfon feared it j an
shame is the only rial punilhment oi acent'oria
power: so that it is true, though milerably true
that beyond a certain line, jult in proportion a
''such a power is wantsd, its authority is of no et
fedt. With us, however, it is different. Pub
Jicity is the censor of* Great-Britain. r i he cer
tainty that the proceedings of every individual
from the highest to the lowcft, will be immeJi
ately transmitted from one end of Ihe country ii
the other, j from Jobnry Grot's houle to the Ul
tin:a Tku/e, keeps all the inhabitants, with aCo
ercion far frronger than the law, fiom doing an
thing, which they w u uid be aihamed to rea<
themfeives, or afraid that others flrould hear.
It is true that this power /nay be, has been, an<
must be liable at times to conliderable abufc, bu
this abuse has its remedy. The great variety o
the papers havipg separate imerefts and feparat
employers, often by contradicting each other, fe
mutual errors to rights j when thele errors ar
palpable, they beo me of little confeqUence. J
they be of a great and dangerous nature, the lav
is open, and it is now upon, experience, not onl;
open to hear, but ready to punish \*nenever then
is occasion. It is true that such prosecutions an

evils our situation exposes tis to as individuals
