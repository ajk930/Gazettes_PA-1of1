The French AmbafTador at this court
is upon the point of his departure. A
few days ago he received a circular let
ter from M. Montmorin, tending to juf
tifv to the court of Naples the conduct
of the National Assembly toward the
King of Ffance.- This letter was com
municated'to M. Acton, who expressed
his pointed di(approbation of its con
tents, and wiflied M. Montmorin to be
informed that " the whole French Na
tion was held in execration in the two
Kingdoms of Naples and Sicily both on
account of their behaviour toward a
lovereign of the family of the Bourbons,
and their unremitted endeavours, by
means of emUfaries and infairvous wri
tings, to promote revolt and sedition in
other Kingdoms and flatcs."âM. Ac
ton added, that the French ConfuTs Se

French Colonies in the Uejl-Indies.
The colonies considered in themlelves

Their relation to the parent countr)
is the foundation of their relative gov
ernment. Laws refpeSing their fepar
ate concerns ought to be made by them
fclvcs ; tliofe of their national concerns
by the nation. This is the Engliih mode
of governing their colonies. Internal
lVj-they are governed by colonial alfem
blies, externally by the laws of parlia
ment. It appears to us, in France, thai
the power of the King of England o;
naming persons to the polts of govern
ment in the Weft-Indies, and thereb",
having an upper house at his command,
is the most efle&ual means of retaining
the colonies under his power. But the
prerogative of the King of France in
this refpeft is not so great as that of the
King of England. The interior admin
istration of the government of the colo
nies is wholly given up to themlelves,
and consequently the officers of their
government are appointed from among
theinfelves. Our Legillature by having
no actual power over the colonies pof
felfes no longer the means of retaining
them. Our legislative supremacy over
them is only conditional, that is, as long
as we make laws to suit them so lon*
will they obey usâcolonial goi-ernment

: rom the duties of his high office have
it length, however, set him upon his
egs again. His physicians attribute his
complaint to the vexations he has re

terests of religion in France. He is,
no doubt, chagrined that his menaces
cannot be executed, as he expe&ed.
Early in September his spiritual thun
derbolts were to have been discharged
upon the reformed clergy of France
and upon the constitution ; the Nation

wrath are, however, poflponed ; and no
longer ago than yeflerday his holiness
declared in full council, that "he meant
to pursue a fyflem of moderation, in re
gard to the affairs of France, as well as
patience and christian charity and
that he " would not proceed to the moll
rigorous mothods of executing his ven

luafion had failed."âThis was as much
as to fay that his anti-revolutional pro

Observations written poflerior to th
circular Address ofCouGÃZssinSept
1779, and prior to their Act of March
1780.]
[Concluded.]
IT has indeed happened, that a progreflivi
depreciation of our currency has accompa
died its growing quantity ; and to this is proba
aly owing in a great measure the prevalence oi
hedoftrine hereoppofed. When the faÂ£l how
:vcr is explained, it will be found to coincide
perfectly with what h.:s beer. said. Every or.?
mud have taken notice that, in ol
Ccrrtgrefs, no prccife time ha>; been (iLpulated
for their redemption, nor any fpecific provision
made for that purpose. A general promile en
tit ling the bearer to so many dollars of metal as
the paper bills exprels, has been the o.ily balls
of their credit. Every one therefore has been
left to his own conjectures as to the time the re
demption would be fulfilled ; and as every ad
dition made to the quantity in circulation,
wou'.d naturally be supposed to remove to a pro
portionally greater dillance the redemption ol
the whole mass, it could not happen otherwise
than that every additional emifTion would be fol
lowed by a fuitber depreciation.
In like manner has the effefct of a difiruft of
public credit, the other source of depreciation,
been erroneously imputed to the quantity ot
money. The circumfiances under which our
early emissions were made, could not but Itrong
ly concur, with the futurity of their redemption,
to debate their value. The lituation of the Uni
ted States referable;) that of an individual enga
ged in an expensive undertaking, carried on, for
want of calh, with bonds and notes secured on
an efiate to which his title was disputed; and
who had besides, a combination of enemies em
ploying every artifice to disparage that security.
A train of sinister events, during the early stages
of the war likewise contributed to increase the
diftrufl of the public ability to fulfil their engage
ments. Before the depreciation anting from
this cause was removed by the luccefs of our
arms, and our alliance with France, it had
drawn so large a quantity into circulation, that
the quantity itfelf soon after begat a diftrul of
j the public difpcfition to fulfil their engagements;
I as well as new doubts, in timid minds, concern
ing the ilTue of the contest. From that period,
( this cause of depreciation has been inceflant
;ly operating. It has lirft conduced to fwcll
the amount of necelfary emissions, aikl from
that very amount has derived new force and ef
| ficacy to itfelf. Thus, a furthet dilcredit of our
j money has neceflanly followed the augmenta
tion of us quantity ; but everv one uiutl perceive,
' that it has not been the eSett of the quantity,
| considered in itfelf, but coiiGdered as an omen
ol public bankruptcy.*
I Whether the money of a country, then, be
1 gold and fiiver, or paper currency, it appears
that its value is not regulated by its quantity. II
it be the former, its value depends on the gene
ral proportion of .gold and fiiver, to circulating
j property thioughout all countries having free
I inter communication. If the latter, it depend
on the credit of the state issuing it, and the time
at which it is to become equal to gold and fiiver.
Every circumllance which has been found to
* As the depreciation of our money has been aj
' cubed to a wrong cause, so, it may be remarked,
have Jf eels ban ascribed to the depreciation, which
rejul tjiom other causes. Momy is the instrument by
which men's wants are J'upplied, and many who
pojjcfs it will part with it fur that purpose, who
; would not grutfy the/if Ives a theexpeiicc of then
| vijibt property. Many also may acquire it, who
j have no visible property. By ncreaflng thequan
, tity oj money therefore, you both increase th. i.eans
Â°JJh ndtn g, a "4Jhmulate the dfire toflperid; and
J the objects drjired do not inc cafe in proportion,
thar price mujl rife from the influence of the great
er demand for them. Should the objects in demand
\ happen, at the fame juncture, as n the United
States, to become farcer, their prices mujt rift in a
double proportion.
It is by this influence of an augmentation of mo
ney on demand, that we ought to account for tha
proportional level of momy, in all countries, which
Mr. Hue attributes to its direct influencconprices.
When an augmentation of the national . oin takes
place, :t may be supposed either, 1. not to aug
ment demand at all; or, 2. toaugi entit so errada
; ally that a proportional increase of induflry will
Juppiythe objects of it ; or, 3. to augment it Jo
rapidly that the donvfuc market may prove inade
quate, whiljl the tafle for dfiinciion natural to
1 wealth, injpires, at the Jam time, a preference for
I foreign luxuries. The f. si cafe c nflldom
Here it to happen, no change in prices, nor any ej
jlux ofmomy, wouldenfue ;. unlfs indeed, itJhould
be employe:!, or leaned abroad. The fuperflucus
portion wot Id ' cither hoarded or turned into plate.
Thefcond caf can ccair onlywhere the augmenta
tion of money advances with a very flow and equa
ble pace', and would be attended neither with a
rtf of pnees, nor with afupejluity of money. The
thu dis the only cafe, in which the plenty 'of money
would 00 upon it to overflow into other countries.
The infujju uncy oj the heme market to fatisfy the
demand would be [applied from fich countries as
might afford the avtichs in demand-, and the money
would thus be di aim deff, till that and the demand
excited by it, fhouldJail to a proper level, and
i balance be thereby rejlored between exports and im
ports.
1 The printipw. cn which Mr, Hume's theory, and
that oj A cntj'quieu's before turn, isfcunded, is rna
"'ffl'y erroneous. He conflders the money in every
country as the icprejentative of the whole circula
te"'' property and induflry in the country-, and
th nee concludes, that every variation in its quan
tity mujl increase or lejfen the portion which repre
flnts thejame portion if property and labor. The
error lies in supposing, that because money fervesto
measure the value of all things, it reprefnts and
is equal in value to all things. The circulating
property in every country, accoi ding to its market
rate, ,ar exceeds the amount of its money. At
Athens oxen, at Rome sheep, were once ujed as a
meajure of the value of other things, h will hard
ly befuppofed, they were threfore equal m value to
all other things.
accurate ike depfeciation of our currency na
turally reiolves itfelf into these general princi
ples. The spirit of monopoly hath affected it
in no other way than by creating an artificial
feat city of commodities wanted for public use,
the conlequence of which has been an increafc
oftheir price, and of the neceffarv emissions.
Now it is thisincreafe of emissions which has been
(hewn to lengthen the supposed period of their
redemption, and to foller suspicions of public
credit. Monopolies destroy the natural relation
between money and commodities ; but it is by
raising the value of the latter, not by debasing
that of the former. Had our money been gold
or filter, the fame prevalence of monopoly
would have had the fame effect on puces and
expenditures; but these would not have had the
fame effefcl on the value of money.
The depreciation of our money has been
charged on mifconduft in the purchasing de
partments : but this mifconducl must have ooe
rated in the fame manner as the spirit of mono
poly. By u.mcceffarily raising the price of ar
ticles required for public use, it has lwelled the
amount of neceffaiy emilfions, on which has
depended the general opinion concerning the
time and the probability of their redemption.
The lame remaik may be applied to the defi
ciency of imported commodities. The deficien
cy of these commodities has raised the price of
them ; the rife of theii price has increased the
emissions for purchasing them ; and with the
increale of emiilions, have incrcafed suspicions
concerning their redemption. j
Those who consider the quantity of monev as '
the criterion of its value, compute the intrinsic
depreciation of our currency by dividing the
whole mass by the supposed necefTary medium
of circulation. Thus iuppofing the medium ne
ceffaiy for the United States to be 30,000,000
dollars, and the circulating emilfions to be
200,000,000 the intrinsic difference between
paper ar.d Ipecie will be nearly as 7 for 1. If
its value depends 011 the time of its redemption,
as hath been above maintained, the real differ
ence will be found to be considerably less. Sup
pose the period nectffaty for its redemption to
be )8 years, as seems to be undeiftood by Con
grels; 100 doll.us of paper 18 years hence will
be equal tn value to 100 dollais of specie ; for at
the end of that term, 100 dollars of specie may
be demanded for them. They muff consequent
ly at this time be equal to as much specie as,
with compound interefl, will amount, in that
number of years, to 100 dollars. If the inter
est of money be rated at 5 per cent, this present
lum of Ipecie'will be about 41 t-2 dollars. Ad
mit, ho -vever the use of money to be worth 6
per cent, about 35 dollars will then amount in
18 years to 100. 35 dollars of specie therefore
is at this time equal to 100 of paper ; that is, the
man who would exchange his specie for paper
at thisdifcount, and lock it in his de(k for 18
years, would get 6 per cent, for his money. The
proportion of>oo to 35 is less than 3toi. The
intrinsic depreciation of our money therefore,
according to this rule of computation, is less than
3 to 1 ; mftead of 7 to 1, according to the rule
espoused in the circular address, or of 30 or 40
to I, according to its currency in the market.
1 shall conclude with observing, that if the
preceding principles and reasoning be just, the
plan on which our domestic loans have been ob
tained, must have operated in a manner direfily
contrary to what was intended. A loan-office
certificate differs in nothing from a common bill
of credit, except in its higher denomination, and
in the iniereft allowed or. it; and the interest is
allowed, merely as a compensation to the lender,
for exchanging a number of small bills, which
being easily transferable, are mod convenient,
tor a single one lo laigc as not to be transferable
in ordinaiy tianfadions. As the certificates,
however, do circulate in many of the more con
lideiable tianfaflions, it may jufily be tmeftion
ed, even on the supposition that the value of mo
ney depended on us quantity, whether the ad
vantage to the public from the exchange, would
juftify the terms of it. But difmifling this con
(ideration, I ask whether Rich loans do in ary
shape, lessen the public debt, and thereby ren
der the difchargc of it less suspected or less re
mote ? Do they give any new affuiance that a
paper dollar will be one dav equal to a filvcr dol
lar, or do they shorten the distance of that day ?
Far from it : Ihe certificates conflitute a part of
the public debt no less than the bills of credit
exchanged for them, and equal chim to
redemption within the general peiiod ; nay, are
to be paid of! long before the expiration of that
period, with bills of crcdit, which will thus re
turn into the geneiai mass, to be redeemed alonâ¢"
with it. Were these bills, therefore, not to be
taki n out of circulation at all, by means of the
certificates, not only the expence of offices for
exchanging, re-exchanging, and annually paying
the interest, would be avoided ; but the whole
sum of interest would be saved, which must mike
a formidable addition to the public emissions
protratl the period of their redemption, and prol
portionally increalc their depreciation. No ex.
pedient could perhaps have been oevifed more
piepolleious and unlucky. In order to relieve
public crcdit finking under the weight of an
enormous debt, we invent new expen litures. In
order to raise the value of our money, which de
pends on the time of its redemption, we have
recourse to a measure which removes its redemp
tion to a more distant day. Instead of paying off
the capital to the public creditors, we give them
an enormous interest to change the name of the*
bit of paper which expresses the sum due to
'hem; and think it a piece of dexterity 111
finance, by emitting lean-office certificates, to elude
the neceflity of emitting b.IU of credit.PHI L.A Delphi A,

" i he claims ot the loyaliftshaving

ment, and objected to on that account in the
hotile of Commons, a Mr. Ar.fley was fern

him fair words indead of money. The confe
quence was, that he returned to England wit!
a very favorable repoit upon their claims, auc

There is the highest probability that the report!
relative to the capturc of l ort Jefferfon, are un
founded,
it is most probable, that General Scott, wit!
the Kentucky militia, way repair to the said port
and bring off the wounded left there; andasitap
f ears too far advanced to be supported, the garri
son may probably be withdrawn.
The public may be allured there are ground;
whereon to estimate the enemy who encountered
Gen. St. Clair's army, at about three thoufanc
warriors. It is said, that upwards of eleven hun
dred warriors of the Cttawas and Chippawas
who inhabit the waters of lake Superior, Micha
gan and Huron, came to the affillance of the Mi
ami Indians. This number, combined with th<
Miami Indians, the Powtewattimas, Wyandots
Telawares, and upper Wabafh Indians, would ful
ly amount to the number above mentioned.
It is said that the Miami Indians, at the head o
whom are the remnants of their towns burnt b]
General Harmar, in C 61. i ;00, sent messages to tin
most distant nations of Indians, as well to the south
ward as to the westward, for afiiftance. Althougl
it does not appear they received any afiiftance fron
the south ward, as a4l those powerful tribes, amount
ing to about fifteen thousand warriors, are at peace
and have treaties with the United states ; yet tht
hostile Indians were but two fuccelsful in theii
negociations westward.
It is further said, that some of the nation of the
Â£ues would have been in the a<stion, had not theii
distance prevented. This nation are very nume
rous, and inhabit the conntry upon the upper parts
of the JVifiifippi, and mostly to the westward
thereof.
It is also said, that neither the famous Mohawk
hief,Capt Joseph Brant, or any of the fix nati
ons, joined the Jviiami Indians. Captain Brant was
at Niagara the beginning of November, several
hundred miles from the place of adtion.
\_From a correfpondent.~\
IT has been observed that most of the wheal
imported from Virginia this year has been found
infected with ,heJ7y. This circumftanee has giv
en rife to the following refleaior.s, which you wil
please to wfert in your Nat.mal Gazette. Two o
three years after the commencement of the lat
warm America, this inftd began its ravages 01
the wheat fields of this country, particularly in th
Â°' Maryland and Delaware, to such a de
gree as to render the grain nearly useless, so tha
during.the latter years of the war, wheat becam
very scarce. But we know of no material damaui
oeing done since, till the present year.âThe Cauf
of the fly being so generally in the wheat at th.
p-riod alluded to, during the war, mud have beti
>wing to the crops being kept in the country for ;
whole year fucCceding the harvest, there not bein f
i iufficient vent for them at that time to foreigi
:ountriesâbut the cause of their being in the Vir
Jima wheat this year originates from the very higf
price that wheat rose to in the spring 1790.' The
extraordinary price of wheat at that time inaucet
lie farmer to let it (land in stack till late in th.
pring of . 7QI. Hence it happens that the few o
his infe<st which are generated every year, beint
iy this means sheltered from the winters froft, an
:arned out into the fields in the ftraiv, and t'her,
lepofite their eggsâlf the wheat in Virginia b.
tept in stack as late the spring ensuing as it wa
ast spring, and the straw not burnt, or as effeflu
lily destroyed some other way, we may expei
heir next crop to be totally ruined, and the fl<
:xtend its ravages into Maryland.
It is a matter of great consequence to the inter
jfts of this country that in cafe of low price
:he farmer should have it in his power to keci
jack one or more crops for better markets. Bu
this can be done with much left waste am
greater {afety to the grain, by having it threthe.
DUt and depofitedin granaries ratherthankeeping 1
over in the stack.âThe fly has, as yet, done ver
little damage farther north than the state of Dela
ware. If therefore the states of Virginia, Mary
land, and Delaware would fall upon some plan t
compel their farmers to threlh out their wheat e
very year, in Virginia by the firft of February, an.
111 Maryland and Delaware by the firft of March
and then immediately either use or destroy th.
straw, it is conceived there never would be an
danger from this deftru&ive infeeft.

A pvopofition was made on the sth of Odober
that thole persons whole property had not been de

of the revolt, and had taken refuge at the Cape

The Holy office of the inquisition at Rome hat
T'lifhcd the trial of M. Oflavius Capelli, whom
hey call the ApoJiU cf unbelief. He has been
ironounced worthy of extreme punifliment, and is

At any Other time than the present hewould have
ieen treated with less severity, but it has bee:,
nought proper to make him a severe example,
>nd exert the utmost rigour of the law, when im
)iety dares to attack the rights of the Holy fee.
People are waiting in anxious expeflation for th
dutodafe [bon-fire] which the Holy Father il
ireparing, in order to execute the fenrence of the

here (hould be such a thing as a secular arm, or
emporal power, at Rome, where the government
s wholly ecclesiastic, did we notconfider that there

Jack ketches, to whom the Church, like a ten

nurder with her own hands.
Another tribunal, not less odious than the of

ALL Is not Truth ('tis said) that travellers teiiâ

If falfe or true âalike to him are gain.
But if this motley tribe fay nothing new,
Then many a lazy, longing look is call
To watch the weary poll-boy travelling through,
On horse's rump, his budget buckled fad ;
With letters fafe in leathern prifoÃ pent
And, wet from press, full many a packet sent.
Not Argus with his fifty pair of eyes
Look'd foarper for his prey than hone ft Type
Explores each package, of alluring size,
Prepared to seize them with a nimble gripe
Did not the post-boy watch his goods, and swear
That village Type shall only have his (hare.

A mere farrago 'tis of mingled things;
What'er is done on madam Terra's fiage

One while, he tells of Monarchs run away ;
And now, of witches downed in Buzzard's bay.
Some miracles he makes, and some he steals ;
Half nature's works are giants in his eyes :
Much, very much, in wonderment he deals,â
New-Hampfliire apples grown to pompkin size,
Pompkins almost as large as country inns
And ladies bearing, each, âthree lovely twins !
He, births and deaths with cold indifference views;
A paragraph from him is all they claim :
And here the rural 'fquirc, amongst the news
Sees the fair record of his father's fame ;
All that was good, minutely brought to light,
All that was ill, âconceal'd from vulgar !

<e The King is informed, gentlemen, that thf
free circulation of grain continues to experiepcf
great difficulties. The tranfpoitations on tm
Loire particularly are exposed ro many obftacler,
The situation of the inhabitants of several depart
ments is thus aft'edted by obfracles, which, by in
creasing their inquietude, at the fame time occa
sion the high price of the I'm all quantity of prov'.
fions which remains in their pofl'eflion. His Mn
jelly cannot fee without concern the catalogue o
evils which may be the consequence of these ob
stacles, and has ordered me to write to you, in th<
moll urgent manner, to put a Hop to them. There
are few circumstances, gentlemen, by which yoi
will be better able to'diftinguilh your zeal, anc
render yourselves more ufeful ; for it is in voui
power, by protecting the free paiTage of grain, tc
iecure the subsistence of a part of the inhabitant!
of the kingdom. It is in your power to prevent
the disorders to which they may abandon them
selves, if they are left longer in uncertainty, with
regard to the succour which is intended lor them.
Jc is in your power to relieve yourselves of all res
ponsibility for these disorders, and to bid defiance
to censure, by employing all the means which the
law has put within your reach, effectually to se
cure the free circulation. It is even the intcreft
of t'nofe under your administration to favor if, and
it will be easy for you to render them sensible ol
this truth, by fliowing them that they would be
the vidtims of their own example, when their
wants should make them feel in their turn in
difpenfabje necefiity for the freedom of circulation.
" The King, in accepting the constitution, pro
mised to cause it to be observed. The King ha-,
promised to cause the laws to be executed : but ii l
forming this engagement, gentlemen, the Kin*
reckoned with, confidence on your zeal, on your
courage, on your firmnefs; the King efpeciall)
confided in that sentiment of honor, which indu
ces free men to ihow themselves worthy of the ho
norable choice which has diftinguilhed them
amongst their fellow-citizens, by calling them tc
fundi ion s which command zeal and attachment.
It is by you alone that the King can cause the
laws to be executed ; you are eftabliflied by the
constitution to a& according to the orders which
he gives you, and when he has transmitted them
to you, his funaion is fulfilled, and your dut)
Commence 1 ;. . , . .
â¢< The King fees with furpnfe that the princi
ples, which the National Afi'emblv has so offer
inculcated on the free circulation of grain, are ftil
disregarded ; and that the attention, which hi!
Majelly has always paid to make them public anc
recommend the observance of them, has not beer
more fuccefsfi*!. He renewed it by his proclama
tion of the 27th of last month. It is your parr
gentlemen, to endeavor to enlighten the peopU
with refpcdl to the evils which mud result frum fc
formal a difobediencc to the law. Inform then
how criminal they will render themselves, by per
illing to oppose the free paiTage of transportations
by your department, aswell as on the course of the
Loire : inform them, that you alio will be crimi
nal, if you longer employ an indulgence, which ha!
hitherto been found ineffectual, and enable mÂ«
quickly to give an account to the King of the ex
ecution of the orders, which I transmit to you b)

Proclamation cjthe King rejpeFting Emigrants*
October 14, T79"1Â«
THE king, informed that a great number o
Frenchmen quit th?:r country, and retire int.
"oreign lands, has not been able to fee, wlthou
he most lively concern, so considerable an cmi
rration ; and though the law allows all French
nen free departure from the kingdom, the king
vhofe paternal tenJernefs watches incefiantly to
;he general intereil, and for the interests of a!
ndividuals, is bound to inform those who re
nove from their country, of their true duty, an*
)f the cause of regret which they prepare for them
lives. If any of them were milled by the idc;
hat they afford the king a proof of their attach
ncnt, let them be undeceived, and underftam
hat the king will legard as his true, his oni;
riends, thole who ccvoperate with liin to main
ain and crtfcrce refpetl to the laws, to eftablhl
rder and peace in the kingdom, and con firry
very species of prosperity for which nature leeto;
o have destined it.
When the king accepted the confiitution, i.<
/ifhed to terminate civil discord, to rc-eftabl.fi
he authority of the laws, and likewise to fecuic
II the rights of liberty and property. He ough
o flatter himfelf, that all Frenchmen would le
ond his design ; "yet, at this very period, rir.i
rations seemed to multiply ; a number of citi
ens abandon their country and their king, anc
ire going to carry to neighboring nations thc 1 <
iches which the wants of their fellow citizens dc
nand $ thus, while the king endeavors to reftori
ranquility, and the happiness, which is its con
equence, it is then that they think that the;
lught to abandon him, and refufe hirn the aid
vhich he has a right to expert from all.
The king is not ignorant that several citizens
specially proprietors, have quitted their country
in'y because they have not found in the authori
y of the laws the protedlion which was due r:
hem ; his heart has lamented these disorders
>ut ought nothing to be allowed to circumstances :
-las not the king himfelf had causes of vexation i
\nd when he forgets them, to attend cniy to ti.'.
ommon happiness, has not he a right to cxpfell
hat they fliould follow his example ? How car
he empire of the laws be eftablifiied, if rll rh<
itizens do not co-operate with the head of :'><
late ? How can a stable and permanent <â ; ' r I:
iftablifhed, and tranquility be reflored, if by ;
incere coincidence every individual does not con
ribute to terminate the general inquietude Â£â
hlow, in fine, shall the common interest fuperfedt
he interest ot individuals, if instead of exlin
;uilhing the spirit of party, every individual per
lfts in his own opinion, and prefers to go intr;
rxile rather than yield to the common opinion ?
What virtuous sentiment, what found intereil
an then produce these emigrations ! The l. iii;
>f party, which has occasioned all our
unes, is calculated only to prolong them.â
r renchmen, who have abandoned your country,
eturn into its bosom ; there is the pofi of honor.
>ecaufe true honor consists in serving our country,
and defending the law . Come to afford then
:'nat support, which is due from all good citizen* ;
lhey, in ie urn, will restore you all ti.'. 1 tianouiii
t) and happiness which you seek in vain in a so
reign land.
Return then, and let the heart of your kim
cease to be diftradted between thole sentiment:
which belong equally to all, and the duties 01
royalty which are principally attached ro thoit
who obey the law. All ought to follow him.
whilst he labors for the happiness of the people.
The king demands this re-union, in order tc
support his efforts, in order ro form the most deai
confolationj he demands it for the happli sO
of all 5 think of the distress which Â«-.n oppÂ«-!i:Â«

Paris, Oft. 14.
IN accepting, fir, the constitution, 1 promise
to maintain it wfahin, and defend Â»t against the
enemies from without the kingdom. I his Â»o

roind every kind ot uncertainty. Jt determine*,
at the fame time, in the clearÂ«it and mo ft prcciit

fliould announce to the trodps under your com
mand, that my determination, which 1 think ei
(ential to the happiftcfs of Frenchmen, 13 as in
variable as is my love for them.
The lav# and the king now blended together,
the enemy of the law becomes the enemy of the
king. Under wha ever pretence disobedience and
want of difvipline may now be coloured, 1 de
clare, that J fliall regard every attempt, every in
fringement of the law, as a crime agÂ«inft the na
:ion and against my person.
There may, perhaps, have been a time when
officers, by an attachment to my perion, doubifu,
if my real sentiments, might have thought ii
heir duty to hefltate on the obligations whicl
teemed to militate against their ii;:t engagement:
âbut after all that I have done, this ertoi
ought no longer to subsist.
I cannot consider those as sincerely dfvoted t<

lafety, confederate themselves with me in fcfied\
ing it, and are resolved to attach thcmlelves infe

Tell, therefore all those who are under you

heir mutual confidence, their entire fubmillioi

hould befecured by a mortgage upon Alsace and
Lorraine, which he wasto in depofir. It is
â¢ven pretended tit at the French Princes, had con
ented to this, fliamefnl condition; but the ac

3. The two high contracting parties fr/al] fet

vantageous measures to be pursued, to secure the
ucceliion to the throne of Poland in favor of the
"ioufe of the eledtor of Saxony.
4. They reserve to themielves the power of
â¢xchar ging part of their pre*ent or future poflef
i:ns, provided the laws of the German empire
je not thereby anyways infringed.
5. They content from the present time reci
procally to reduce their military state, as soon at
