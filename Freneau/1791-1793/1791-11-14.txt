3.Entries in Washington county amounting

grants have already llTued. Ot the remaining
531,812,3-4 acres, a conf.derable proportion
were declared void by the laws ol the lt.n.e,>and
were particularly ekcluded from the cover of the

aihed (hallextend, or be construed to extend, to
he making good any entry or entries, or any
irant or grants, heretofore declared void, by anv
icf or acls of the General Assembly of this state.
Still it is to be confideied, that many of thele
ierfons have fettled and improved the lands, are
vllling, as is laid to comply with lucli conditions
iS ihall be required of other purchasers, form a
hong barrier on the new frontier, acquired by
he treaty of Hoi Hon, arid are therefore objects
meriting the conlideration of the legiflatuie".
4.. Entries in Sollivan county, amounting to
240,624 acres; for .173.33880 res of which grants
have already iffusd ; pr the remaining entries,
many are certified void, and others understood

:xtending up Powel's river in a breaalth of not
â¢fs than 4-miles, and down Clinch's from their
unflion in a breadth not less than 12 miles. A
;reat part of this is within the Indian teriitory.
Among the grants <5f the fla'e now under re
:apitulation, as forming exceptions Out of the
:bfolu:e lights of the United States, irt rrot to
>e reckoned here two grants of 2,000 acres each
o Alexander Martin and David Wilfoii, adja
ent to the lands allotted to the officers and lol
liers ; nor a grant ol 25,000 acres on Duck river
u the late Major General Greene ; because
hey are wholly within the Indian territory, as
ckno-vlcdged by the treaties of Hopewell and
iolftod.
The extent of the third reservation in favour
if entries made in Armstrong's office is not yes
n*iro!y known, not can be t)U the soth-el I
1795, the last day given for perfecting
hem : the sum of certificates, however, which
lad been paid for these warrants into the trea
sury ofthe state, before the 20th day of May
1790, reaches in all probability near to their whole
amount; this was /" 373> 6 49- 6 5> currency of
:hat State, and at the price of/. 10 the hundred
icres eftablilbed by law, {hews that warrants had
fl'ued for 3,736,493 acres; For 1,762,660 of
?hefe, grants have palled, which appear to have
seen located partly in thecoun ies of Greene and
Hawkins, and partly in the country, from ihence
to the Miffifippi as divided into Ealtern, Middle
and Western diftrifts. Almost the whole of
these locations are within the Indian territoryâ
besides the warrants paid for as before mention
ed it is known that there aie some others out
standing and not paid for : but perhaps these
need not be taken into account, as payment of
them has been de puted on thr ground, that the
lands being within the Indian territory, cannot
now be a livered to the holders of the war
rants.
On a review of all the reservations, after mak
in fiich con "eftural allowance as our information
authorizes, for the proportion of them,which may
be within the Indian boundaries, it appears pro
bable that they cover all the ceded lands suscep
tible of culture, and Ch-ated of the Indian t.tle,
that is to fay, all the habitable parts of the two
triangles beforementioned, excepting only the
lands louth of French Broad, and 3ig Pigeon
Rivets. Thele were part of the tract appropri
ated by-the laws of the state, to the use of the In
dians, whose title being purchased at the late
treaty of Holfton, they are now free to be dif
uofed of by the United States, and are probably
the only lands open to their disposal, within (hi:
southwestern territory, which can excite the at
tention of purchasers. 1 hey are supposed to a
mount to about 300,000 acres, and we are told
ihat 300 families have already set down upor
them without right or license.
The territory of the United States nortnwell
of the Ohio, is bounded on the foufh by that ri
ver, on the east, by Pennsylvania, on the north
and weft, bv the lines which divide the United
States from the dominions of Great Britain and
Sf> Th'e part of this territory occupied by Indians,
is north and well of the following lines, efta
-1 11flaed with the Wiandots, Delawares, Chippa
was and Ottawasby the treaty of Fort M'lntolh,
andi with the Shawanefe, by that of the Great
Miami, to wit; beginning at the mouth of the
t avaho. a, and running up the river to the pou
a -e' between that and the Tufcaroras branch o!
theMutkingum, then down the laid branch to
the Forks, at the crofting place above Fort Law
cace then weltwardly, towaids the pottage ol
Numb. 5
the Big Miami, to the main branch of that river,
then down the.Miaini to theFoikof that river,next
below the old For ,which was taken by th; French
in 1752 ; thence due weft to the river De la
Pante, and iown that river to the VVabafh. So
far the lines are precil'e.ly defined, and the whole
country southward of these lines, and ea'tward ot
the VVabafi. cleared of the claims oi thole Indi
ans, as it is also of those of the Pou iwatinias,
and Sacs, by the treaty of MuOtingum. How
far on the other lide of the Wabalh, the southern
boundary of the Indians has been defined, we
know not. It is only understood in general,that
theirtitle toih lower country, betweenthat river
and (he Illinois, has been formerlv extinguiihed
by the French, while ifi their poileflion. As to
that countiy then, and what lies still Bevond the
Illinois, it would seem expedient that nothing be
done, till a fair afcenainmetit ot boundary can
take place, bv mutual consent, between us and
the Indiansinlereftcd.
The country within the Wabafb, the Indian
line before dcfcribed, the Pennfvlvania line,
and the Ohio, contains, on a loose eflimate, a-
Dout 55,000 square miles, or 35 millions of acres.
During the British government, great numbers
of perfonshad formedthemlelves intocompanies
inder different names, such as the Ohio, the
Wabache, the Illinois, the Mifiifippi, or Van
lalia companies, and had covered, with their
ipplications, a great part of this territory. Some
if them had obtained orders 011 certain conditi
ons, which, having never been fulfilled, their ti
les were never completed by-giants. Others
tfere only in a state of negociation, when the Bii
ifli authoiity was discontinued; Some of these
:laims being already Under a special reference by
irder ofCongrefs, and all of them probably fat
ing, nnderthe operation of the fame principles,
hey will not be itoticed in the present report.
The â claim's if citizens o be-here ftaied Will be,
1. Those refeived by the state.-. in their deeds

11. Those .which have arisen under the go
'ernmem of the United States themTelves.

2. A rcfervation in the deed of Virginia of
the poiLfTions and titles of the French and Cana
dian inhabitants and other settlers of the Kutkaf
kias, St. Vincents, and the neighbouring villa
ges, who had piofefTed thenifelves citizens of
Virginia, which rights have been fettled by an
afct of the last fefiioii of Congress, intituled "An
ast for framing lands to the inhabitants and set
tlers at Vincennes and the Illinois country in the
territory north weft of the Ohio, and for con
firming them in their pofTeffions." These lands
are in the neighbourhood of the several villa
gers.
g. A rcfervation in the fame deed of a qunn
irv not exceeding 150,000 acies of land for
general George Rogers Clarke, and the officers
ind fo'diers of his reginent who were at he
eduction of Kafkafkias, and St Vincents, to be

choose. Th 1 chose they Ihou'id be laid off 011
.he river adjacent to the rapids, which ac
cordingly has been dene.
4. A reservation, in the fame deed, of lands
between the Siota and Little M.ami, to make up
to the Virginia troops on continental establish
ment, the quanii'y which the good lands, in their
southern allotment, might fall lhort of the boun
ties given them by the laws of that state. 3y a
statement of the 16th of September 1788, it ap
pears that 724,045 2-3 acres had been fuiveyed
for them on the south eafietn fide of the Ohio;
that 1,395,385 1-3 acres had been furveved oil
the north wefternlide ; that warrants for 649 649
acres mOFe, to be laid off on the fame fide of the
the river, were in the hands of the lurveyor, and
it was supposed there might (till be some few
warrants not yet presented ;so that \his reserv
ation may be (Uited at 2,045,034 1-3 a res, or
perhaps some small matter more.
11. The claims of individual citizens derived
from the United States thenifelves ate the fol
lowing.
1. Those of the continental army, founded on
the resolutions of Congress of September 16,
1776, August 12, and September 30, 17S0, 3nd
fixed by the ordinance of M y 20, 1785. The
resolution of October 22, 1787, and the supple
mentary ordinance of July 9' 1,1
ven ranges of townlhips, beginning at a point on
the Ohio, due north from the weflern termina
tion of a line then lately run, as the southern
boundary of Pennsylvania ;orin a fccOnd traÂ£t
of a million of acres, bounded eafl, by the y,\\
range of the laid townships, south by the lands ofCutlernnd Sargent; north, by an extenfiono
the northern boundary of the said townships
and going towards the weft so far as to includ<
the above quantity, or, lastly, in a third tract o
country ; beginning at the mouth of the Ohio
and running up the Miftifippi to the river Ai
Vaufe, thence Up the fame till it meets a wef
line from the mOuth of the Little Wabafh
thence along (hat line to the G>eat Wabaih
thence down the fame, and the Ohio, to the be
ginning. The sum total of the 'said militar)
claims is 1,851 800 acres.
2. Thofc of the individuals who made pur
chafi' of land at New-Yoik. within the said fe*
ven ranges of townflnps, according to the refolu
tions of Congress of April '21, 1787, and tbc
fuppiemfniary ordinance of julv 9, 1788, whicl
claimsamount to 150,896 acres.
3. The parchafe of one million affd a half acr<
of land by Cutler and argent, on behalf of certtm
individuals, affociatcd under the name of the ( h ;
Company. 1 his begins where the hio is inter
fe&ed by the 'western boundary of the 7th rangi
ot townships, and runs due north on that bound,,
ry 1306 chains and 25 links; thence due weft t
the western boundary of the 17th range of town
lhips; thence due south to the C hio, and up tha
river to the beginning; the whole area contain
ing , 8 ,760 acrcs of land, whereof 28 ~ 60 acre
confiding of various lots and townships, are referv
ed to the United tates.
4. The pur chafe by the fame Cutler and argen
on behalf also of themselves and others. This begin
at the north-eastern angle of the tradl of their pur
chafe before described, and runs due north to th
northern boundary of the oth township from th
1. hio; thence due weft, to the ioto; thence dov,:
the fame, and up the hio to the fouth-wefteri
angle of the said pur chafe before described, an*
along the western and northern boundaries thereo
to the beginning , the whole area containing 1
90 ,480 acres of land, out of which, however
fiv lots, to wit, Nos. 6, 26, and .1
of every township, of fix miles square, are re
tained by the United State's, and out of the whol
are retained the three townships of Gnadenhut
ten, choenbrun, and alenr: and certain lane!
around them, as will be hereafter mentioned.
5. The purchase of ohn Cltves Symmes, boun
ded on the weft by the Great Miami; on the foutl
by the Ohio; on the east by a line which is to be
gin on the bank of the Ohio, 20 miles from th
mouth of the great fv iami, as measured along th
several courfcs of the Ohio, and to run parallel
with the general course of the said Great Iv iami
and on the north by an east and weft line, so rui
as to include a million of acres in the whole area
whereof five lots, numbered as before mentioned
are reserved out of every townftiip by the Unite<
States.
It is suggested that this purchaser, under colou
of a fir ft and larger proportion to the board o
Treasury, which was never closed, (but pendinj
that proposition) fcld funclry parcels of land, be
tween his eastern boundary before mentioned, an*
the Little i\ iami ; and that the purchasers hav
fettled thereon. If these suggestions prove true
the fettlcrs will, perhaps, be thought to merit th
favor of the legifluture, as purchasers for valuabl<
confederation, ;j aud without notice of the defedl 0
title.
The contrasts for lands, which were at one tim*
under confederation with MefTrs. Flint fetid Park
er, and with Colonel Morgan, were never i' 6Fa
prosecUted as to bring either party under any o'oli
gation. All proceedings thereon were difcontinu
cd at a very early ft: and it is supposed that n<
further views exist with any party, These, there
fore, are not to be enumerated among exiftinj
claims.
6. Three townships were reserved by the ordi
nance of May 20, 17 5 adjacent to Lake Erie, so
refugees from Canada and Nov a Scotia, and so
other pur poles, according to refolutinnsof Congress
made or to be made on chat fubjctfl. , liefe vvouli
of course contain 6 ,120 acres.
7. The fame ordinance of ay 20th,r 785, appro
priated the three towns of Gnadenhutten, Schoen
brun, and Salem, on the Muikingum, for the chril
tian inuians formerly fettled there, or the re
mains of that society, with the grounds round a
bout them, and the quantity of the said circum
jact-nt grounds, for each of the said towns, "wa
determined by the resolution of Congre's of Sep
tember 3d, 1 88, to be so much as, with the piai
of its refpeilive town, ou'd make up 4000 a
cres ; i'o that the three towns and their circumja
cent lands were to amounfto 12,000 acres. Thu
reservation was accordingly made out of the
larger purchase of cutler and Sargent, which
comprehended them. The Indians, however, for
whom the reservation was made, have chosen
to emigrate beyond the limits ef the United
States, so that the lands reserved for them, still
remain to the United States.
On the whole, it appears that the United ' tateÂ«
may rightfully difpoi'e of all the lands between the
Vabafh, the Ohio, Pennsylvania, the forty-firfl
parallel of latitude, and the ndian lines described
in the treaties of the Great Miami, and Fort
iw'.ntofh, with exceptions only of the rights saved
by the deed of cefiion of Virginia, and of all rights
legally derived from the government of the Uni
tes States," and the pait louch of the
Indian lines, to contain as before conjectured a
bout 35 millions of acres, and that the claims ef
citizens before enumerated may am to be
tween thiitfeen and fourteen millions there remaiil
at the difpolal ot the United State:, upwards oj
twenty-one millions of acres, in this north-western
quarter.
And though the want of actual surveys of fomc
parts, and of a general delineation of the whol
on paper, so as to exhibit to the eye the
forms, and relative positions of the rights brfoH
described, may prevent our forming a weil de
fined idea of them at this distance, yet, on the
spot these dithculties exist but in a small degree i
The individuals there employed in the details oj
buying, felling, and locating, pofiefs local in
formationsof the parts which concern them, so*?
to be able to keep clearofeaih others rights; or
fin some inflances a conflict of claims should a
i iie, from any want of certainty in their definiti
an, a local judge will doubtless be provided to de
ide them without delay, at least provilionally
Time, infiead of clearing up these incertainties
will cloud them the more, by the death or remov
al of vvitnelles, the disappearance of lines ant
marks, change of parties, and other casualties,

The report of the Secretary of State
being read, was referred to the com
rriitree appointed to prepare and brins
n a bill or bills to eftaolifh officcs so:
the purpose of granting lands withir
the territories of the United States.
Upor motion of Mr. Parker, it wa:
ordered, that the Secretary of the Trea
fury report to the House the amount o
the exports from the several diftrift:
within the United States, fefpeftively
also, of duties arising on imports anc
tonnage, from the 2gth of Septembei
1790, to Sept. 30th 1-791.
i J urluant to the order of the day, th<
House again resolved itfelf into a com
mitteeof the whole on the schedule o:
enumeration of the inhabitants of the
United StatesâMr. Muhlenberg in the
chair.
Proportion be?ore the committee,
that until the next enumeration, the ra
tio of representation fhd.il be of one
member for every thirty thousand in
habitants.âThe immediate motion anc
amendment before the committee, tc
strike out " thirty thousand"â
The motion and amendment beihe
called upâ
Mi. Geftftv gave his opinion aga'infl
ftr iking out, and thought Â»he sentiment:
of the great body of the people oughi
to be well known previous to the a
doption of the amendment. Wher
the constitution was adopted, five state:
were in favor of the ratio last mention
ed. until the representation should be
increased to two hundred ; several othei
states had fignified their opinion thai
the number proposed in the constitu
tion was too i'mall to I'ecure the libertie:
of America.âThe American govern
ment being by representation, he ob
lerved, that the House of Representa
tives was the only part of that govern
ment upon which the people had an
immediate check : the less, therefore,
the number consisted of, the less effici
ent would be the controul of the peo
ple over themâThe increase of ex
pence had been matter of complaint to
some, but in future, he apprehended,
the time spent in thefeffions would rare
ly or never exceed four months in the
year, which would reftrift the expence
of an increased representation within
very moderate bounds. The citizens
of the United States had expected the
prelent would be the ratio adopted, and
although the House was not pofitivelv
bound by the constitution to give one
member for every thirty thousand, yet
it was expected this would be agreed
to ; and that fixing a representation of
one to forty thouland, would be con
sidered rather an unwarrantable stretch
of power. He observed that eight
states had already adopted the firft ar
ticle of the proposed amendments to
the constitution, and should they make
any alterations from the present ratio,
they might, in consequence of the rati
fication of said amendments by a fuf
ficient number of states. be obliged to
repeal the ast before the close of the
present leffion. When, upon the ra
tio already fettled, the reprefentatien
amount? to one hundred, Congress will
have an undoubted right to fix it there,
until they shy 11 establish lome ratio, by
which the representation and popula
tion shall keep pace with each ether,
till the number of rep re fen tat i ves in
Congress amounts to two hundred.
Mr. Boodisot was for flrikinÂ£ out
" thirty thousand." The increale of
representation, he observed, would
otherwise become so great in a short
O
time as to impede the pVogrefs of busi
ness in the House. He had calculated,
that the ratio of thirty thoul'and would
produce 113 members ; thirty-five thou
sand would give 97 ; and forty thou
sand would produce 81. This last num
ber would be tolerable, if not exceed
ed ; which, however, must inevitably
be the cafe, on taking the next cenlus.
The increase of expence with an increas
ed representation was, in his view, a
serious objectâif the number of repre
sentatives was doubled, the expence
would be prodigious, as not only the
amount of actual compensation must be
doubled, but double the time would be
necelTary to do the public business, as
every member had an equal right to de
liver his sentiments, and by this means
protraftthe feflions to an unreasonable
length. He did not fee that the liber
ties of the people required an immense
representation, the power veiled ir
Congress being not proportionate tc
their number. Ihirty-five thousand
he thought, would be the moll eligible
ratio, which would fix the number a
ninety-seven.
Mr. Clarke wasagainftan increafec
representation, as amongfl many othe]
ill consequences, it would increase the
number of public offices. The prefem
ratio he thought fufficiently favorable
uo the libei ties of the people, efpeciallv
when it was considered that the door:
of the house were open to the public,
Mr. Steele feared too numerous;
representation at one to thirty thousand
At the fame time the fractional number:
incident to the ratio of one to 40,00 c
would leave 369,000 people unrepre
lented. 1 hirty-five thousand he though)
the number at present least
objeÂ£lions>, but that if the real voice oi
the- country could be obtained, he be
lieved that even 50.000 would not be toe
high a ratio. He dreaded too numer
ous an assembly, as in that cafe their de
liberations would generally be confufec
Â£nd tumultuous, which never fails tc
detract from the refpeftability of am
government. With refped to the pro
poled cohflitutional amendments h<
â¢ bferved they had not been ado'ptec
by three-fourths of the slates, and tron
thence concluded thev would be finalh
rejected. Mr. Steele finifhed his obfer
nations by declaring that, as circum-
Itances flood, he would vote for thirty
five thoufahd. 7
Several thergentlemen having fpoki
on this fubjeft, the committee rose
when the House resolved, that, in com
mittce of the whole, it will again taki
the lehedule of enumeration into con
fideration to-morrow.

ARATUS.
Number I.
THE effort of the people of France
to emancipate themselves from a
tyranny rigorous and of long duration,
has not been the productive source of
controversy to the European world on
ly. The flame it excited there, has been
communicated like an electric {hock
across the Atlantic, nor has the distance
nor the element through which it passed
been able to mitigate its fury. The dif
cuflion which was commenced on that
iubjeft in a neighboring monarchy, by
two men of eminence on the political
theatre, we have seen revived here with
equal ardour, and extended with won
derful rapidity by different dire&ions to
all parts of the United States.
T. he effect which this event produced
in the other hemisphere, if it had not
been too well authenticated to leave a
doubt behind, would otherwise have ex
ceeded the bounds of credibility. It ap
pears to have given the alarm to theo'd
eft and most firmly established monar
chies ; and even those, which but a few
years past, would have bade defiance to
the veteran armies of that ga'lant na
tion, ieem now to tremble for their fafe
ty. As if some contagious malady were
to be caught from the intercourse, all
communication is inhibited, where it
can be aecomplifhed, between their fub
jefts refpeaively, and those of that re
public. The king of Spain, we are told,
has lined his frontier with horsemen
who inceilantly patrole, for that purl
pole, from one extremity of his kingdom
r 1 ? 0th p r -~ The V n Â§ s of England,
Naples, lruilia, and even the pacific
Leopold, are disquietedâ and the Pope
is laid to dread more the introdudion of
an accurate account of their Operations
among his lubjefts, than the most blind
ly credulous and weak, of the Europe
an princes, formerly did his bull of ex
communication, or other the severest
ceniures of the church.
But the terror which this wonder
working Ipirit in Franca created, has
not been confined to the antient hemis
phere ; A kindred panic has reached
America. Great mifchief appears to be
apprehended from its widely fpreadin*
influence among the people ; and cham
pions or no common iize have arose to
combat it, by warning their country
its fatal tendency.
11.US, we behold the operations of
e rench, which have been confined
0 t e.r own territory and themselves ;
âoperations too, which have onlv
lought some change in their own go
vernment, to make it more instrumental
to the general happiness, and founded
in the mild and benign I'pirit of peace,
aiftuhng over the civilized world, a
mong ceitain ranks of men, a general
1 may. Ihe movements of human
j r ln aII lts various stations, have
and forever will responsive to the
atne principles. A common danger
will unite those whose interests are the
ame. rinces, and those of royal hopes,
whom jealousy, pride, and ambition;
ivou otherwile have arranged in op
position to each other, when the ground
eir relpe&ive elevations is queftion
= /rÂ°r t0 be enemi cs. And as they
poiids the power, and no person will
ooubt their inclination to exert it, ei
er to preserve or-acquire, those upon
w om the intolerant yoke has been pla-"cd. or who wish to ward it off, should
be the more viligant in their behalf.
In tracing on the faithful page of hif
tcry, the deplorable condition into
which that unfortunate, butaccomplifh
ed and gallant nation was plunged f'eve
ral centuries part, and the affli&ions
which have unceafmgly harraffed them
lince under the fcourgc of a rigorous
despotism, the tear of l'ympathy wiJl not
fall from the eye of the philanthropic a
lone. If we extend our observation to
the revolution which has been lately at
chieved. and contemplate its happy ef
fects on the present age, as well as those
which lie in {lore for posterity, the change
mull be considered an important one in
deed. The day on which the tyranny
fell, and the rights of nature lsng fup
preiTed and violated ; the day on which
the King, his ministers, and the proud
est nobles of his court, in common with
the humblest peasant in the field, bowed
under the authority of the law, was an
happy one for France. When the lat
ter, standing alone, and unsupported by
the patronage of friends, might with
fafety fay to the former " whilst I ful
fil my moral obligations, and discharge
my duty to the state, I fear you not:
those paflions heretofore more fiercc and
terrible, than the severest blasts of Hea
ven, and which of late would have
struck me from exillence, for a less of
fence. have now a barrier formed a
gainst them-, which tvill baffle their
icrce : the sentence of my peers miift
pafsupen me, before I can be injured."
Ihis indeed was an important and a
happy day, not for the people of France
only, but for all mankind.
It we look into the interior ofthe sur
rounding monarchies, the most frightful
picture presents itfclf to view. There
despotism still reigns with unabated
vigour. It has deprived man of his
natural and civil rights, and left him
r.aked and exposed to the blow, whene
ver malice or the unprovoked revenge
of those in power choose to inflict it. !t
has made that balm of comfort, which
was kindlv interwoven in the frame of:
his being, by the Author of his Exig
ence, the source of his opprefSon. It
has raised upon his religious faith, upon
his belief in Heaven and a future state
(a coniolation which no eart'hlv tribu-j
nal can give or take away) a long train
of hisrarchal establishments, which
serve only to add to the power ana the
splendour of the court. Preying in
fkort, in every respect, on the best 'in
terests of man, it has done every thing
but exterminate him.
To those who are placed at the head
of nations, in this situation, who have j
every thing to hope from its continu-t
ance, and a long account to render for
past enormities, if they should ever be
called to account, any change that may
pofTibly tend to diflurb their security.
must be alarming. That they should
di(countenance the revolution in France,
misrepresent the mild and lenient mea
sures which led to it, traduce and vilify
the chaiafters of those illustrious patri
ots who have been the principal medis
of its accomplishment, and, in fine, wish
to throw a veil over their whole pro
ceedings, cannot be matter of lurprize.
The light of truth and of reafen mull
not penetrate through the dreary gloom,
which despotism has created, and now
forms its only support, or its millions
are undone.
But the principle upon which the
French revolution was founded, is not a
novel one here. Whoever appeals to
thole solemn acts, which juftified us to
the impartial world, in taking up arms
against Great-Britain, and dismember
ing ouifelves from that monarchy, if lie
views them through an unbiassed me
dium, must recognize it there. In Ame
rica. indeed, the tyranny was in embryo
only, and at a distanceâand yet we
conceived ourselves authorised, to ap
ply timely force to prevent its establish
ment. In France it was at the height,
and at home, and they suppressed it. In
both instances, the power which belong
ed to the body of the people, and which
had been, or was about to be wrested
from them, was resumed. It now rests
where it should be, in possession of the
rightful proprietors, ana will be exerci
sed for their advantage. Whoever owns
the principles of one revolution, must
cherish those of the other; and the per
son who draws a distinction between
them, is either blinded by prejudice, or
boldly denies what at the bar of reaion,
he cannot refute. To the people of
f ranee it mull be matter of aftonilh
nent,that a contrary sentiment can exist
lerc; and those patriots who fought
ino. bled,in our service, and who bear
uch honorable testimonials of their no
lle 'md brilliant exertions in the holy
'aufe of freedom, on this fide of the At
antic, although surrounding nations
hould now reprobate their conduct,
nuft calculate with certainty upon our
ountenance and support.

The day before Capt. Lake failed, a sri

at Port Magot.
Some accounts are also said to have
been received by the fame vÂ«#el, pur
porting that the mulattoes in the neigh

ON THE SLEEP OF PLANTS.
(A curious new aifcovery.)
WHEN funs are set, and stars in view,
Not only man to slumber yields ;
But nature grants this blessing too,
To yonder plants in yonder fields.
The summer heats and lengthening days
(To them the fame as toil and care)
Thrice welcome make the evening breeie,
That kindly does their strength repair*
At early dawn, each plant survey,
And fee, revived by nature's hand,
With youthful vigor, frefh and gay,
Their blofl'oms blow, their leaves expand.
Yon garden plant, with weeds o'er-run,
Not void of thought perceives its hour,
And, watchful of the parting fun,
Throughout the night conceals her flawer.
Like us, the slave of cold and heat,
She too enjoys her little span,
With reason something less complete
Than that which makes the boafl of man.
Thus, moulded from one common clav,
A varied life adorns the plain ;
Bv nature fubjeft to decay,
By nature meant to bloom again !
