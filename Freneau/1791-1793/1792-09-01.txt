PAINE's LETTERS t 9 bUNDAS.
Sir,
AS you opened the debate in the house
of commons, May 25th, 6n the
proclamation for fupprefling publications,
which that piailamation (without naming
any) calls wicked and ieditions, and as
you apply those opprobious epithets to the
works, entitled, RIGHTS OF MAN, I
think it jjecefTaiyto offer any other ftsfau
for addressing this letter 10 you.
1 begin then at once, by declaring, that
I do not believe there are to be found in
the writings of any author, ancient or mo
dein, on the fubjeft of government, a fpi
ritof greater benignity, and a ftror.ger in
culcation of moral principles than in those
which I have published. They come, fir,
from a man, who, by having lived in seve
ral countries, and under different systems
of government, and who, being intimate
in the conftiuÂ£tion of them, is a better
judge of the fubjedl than is poiTible that
you, for the want of those opportunities,
ean be : and besides this, they come from
a heart that knows not how to beguile.
1 will further fay, that when that mo
ment arrives in which the bell consolation
that shall be left will be that of looki
back on some pail actions, more virtuous
more meritorious than the refl, I (hall then
with happiness remember, among oilier
things, I have written the righ s of man.
As to what proclamations, or profeciitions,
or place men, or place expe&ants â those
who poflefs, or thofi who arc gaping for
office, may fay Â».f them, it will net alter
their chara&er, either with the world or
with me.
Having, fir, made this declaration, I
/hall proceed to remark, not particularly
Upon your own speech upon that occalion,
but on any other speech to which your
motion on that day gave rife ; and I shall
begin with that of Mr. Adam.
This gentleman accuses me of not hav
ing done the very th : ng that T have done,
and which (he fays) iff hid done, he
Ihould not have accused me.
Mr. Adam, in his speech, fay'?, "That
he had well conlidered the fubjtft of 'lon
ftitutional publications, and was by no
jneans ready to fay (but the contrary) that
books offcience upon government, though
recommending a doctrine or fyltem dif
ferent from the form of out constitution
(meaning that of Euglimd) were fit objects
of prosecution : that if he did, he mult
condemn (which he meant not to do)Har
lingtoH for his Oceana, Sir Thomas More
for his Utopia, and Hume for his idea of
a perfedt commonwealth. But (continu
ed r. Adam) the publication of Mr.
Paine wa* very different, for it reviled
what was mod sacred in the constitution,
deflroyed every principle of subordination,
and ellablifhed nothing in their room "
I readily perceive that Mr. Adam had
not read the second part of the rights of
mail, and I am put under the neccffity, ei
ther of submitting to an erroneous charge,
or of juftifying myfelf against it; and I
certainly (hail piefer the latter. If then
I shall prove to Mr. Adam that, in my rea
-lonrng upon fyflems of Government in the
second part of the Rights of Man, I have
fl-ewn, as clearly, I think, as vVords can
convey ideas, a certain fyflem of govern
ment ; and that not existing in theory on
ly fct:t already in full and eftabhflied prac
tice, andfyftematically and practically free
from all the vices and defects of the Eng
lish government, and capable of producing
more happiness to the people, and that
also with an eighteenth part of the taics,
which the present fyftemof theEngiifh go
vernment consumes: I hope he will do me
the jufticewhen he next got s to the house
to get up and confefs, he had been mista
ken in faying, that I had eflablifhed no
thing, and that I had deflroyed every
principle of subordination Having thus
opened the cafe, I now come to the point.
By P. FREN EA U : Pu.blifh.cd Wednesdays and Saturdays, al Three Dollars per annum.
S A T U R D A Y, September i, 1792.
In the second part of the Rights of
Man, I have diflingiiifhed government into
two .classes or systems ; the one the heredi
taiy system ; the other the representative
system.
In th'r firft part of the Rights'of Man,
I have endeavoured to shew, and I chal
lenge any man to refute it that there does
not cxrft a right to establish hereditary go
vernment ; or, in other words/ hereditary
governors ; because hereditary government
always means a government yet to come,
and the cafe always is, that the people who
are to live afterwards have always the fame
right to choose a government for them
selves, as the people had who lived before
them.
In the second part of the Rights of
Man, I have not repeated those arguments,
because they are irrefutable ; but have
confined myfelf to shew the defe&s of
what is called hereditary government, or
hereditary succession, that it mud, from
the nature of it, throw government into
the hands of men totally unworthy of it
from want of principle, or unfitted for it
from want of capacity. James the J Id. is
recorded as an instance of the firft of these
cases ; and instances are to be found almost
a 1 over Europe to prove the truth of the
latter.
To {hew the ab'funjuty of the hereditary
system flill more ilrongly, I will now put
the following cafe : Take any fifty mert
promifcuouflv, and it will be very extraor
dinary, if out of that number, one man
fhou'd be found, whose principles and ta
lents taken tog ther (for some might
have principles, and oihets have talents)
would render him a person truly fitted to
fill any very extraordinary office of nation
al trull. If then ftich a fitnefs of charac
ter could not be expetted to be found in
more than one person out of fifty, it would
happen but once in a thousand years to
the eldgll son of any oite family,' admitting
each, on an average, to hold the office
twenty years. Mr. Adam talks of some
thing in the Confiitution which he calls
mod facicd ; but I hope he does not mean
hereditary fucc ffion, a thing which ;p
---pears to me a violation of every order of
nature a;id of common sense.
When I look into hitlory & fee the mul
titudes of men, otherlvife virtuous, who
have died, and their families been ruined,
in defence of knaves and fools, and which
they would not havt done had they rea
soned at all upon the system ; I do not
know a greater good than an individual
can render to mankind than to end -4vour
to break the chains of political superstition.
Those chains Are dissolving fact, and pro
secutions will serve but to hasten that difTo
lution.
Having thus spoken of the hereditary
system, as a bad system, and fu ; jeÂ£l to
fcvery possible defrdt ; I now come to the
representative system ; and this Mr. Adam
will find Rated in the second part of
Rights of Man, not only as the best but
as the only theory of government under
which thelibertks of a pecjlecan be pei
inanently secure.
But it is needlefo now to talk of mere
theory, since there is already a government
in full practice ; established upon that theo
ry, or, in other words, upon the Rights
of"Man, and has been so for almost twen
ty years. Mr. Pitt, in a speech of kis,
some short time since, said, "that there
" never did, and never could exill a go
" vernment established upon those rights,
" and that if it beean at nooJi, it would
" end at night." Mr. Pitt is not yet ar
rived at the degree of a fchocl boy in this
species of knowledge. His practice has
been confined to the means of extorting
revenue, and his boast h?s beenâhow
much ? Whereas the boast of the system
of government that i am speaking of is,
not how much, but how little.
The system of government purely re
presentative, unmixed with any thing of
hereditary nonfevfe, began in America.
I w ill now compare the effetts of that fyf
tem of government, with the fyltem
of government in England, both during
and since the c'ofe of the war.
So powerful is the rcprefentative fyf
tem ; full, by combining and confo'ida
ting all the parts of a country together,
however great the extent ; and fecond'y,
by admitting of none but men properly
qualified into the government, or difmif
ling them if they prove to be otherwise,
that America vfas enabled thereby total
ly to defeat and overthrow all the Ichemes
and projects of the hereditary government
of Engl.i. d againll her. As the tftablifh
rnent of the revolution and independence
of America is a proof of this faÂ£t, it is
needless to enlarge upon it.
I now come to the co nparStive effect o!
the two fyllems since th- close of the war,
and I rcqueft Mr. Arfain to attend to it.
America had internally fuflained the ra
vage of upwards of seven ) ears of war,
which England had not. l-'ngland fuf
â¢ained only the expence of the war;
whereas America fu(tained, rot only the
expcnce, but the deltruftion of property
committed by both armies Not a house
was built during that period, and many
thousands were deftrovedâThe fiims and
plantations along the coast of the country,
for more t :sn a thousand miles, were laid
wafleâHer commerce was annihilated
Her (hips were either taken or had rotted
within he own harbourâThe credit ol
her funds had fallen upwards of ninety pel
cent, that is an original hundred pounds
would not fell for ten pounds. In fine,
she was ap arently put back an hundred
years when the. war elofed f which was
not the cafe with England.
But such was the event, that the fame
representative system ot government,
though since better organized, which ena
bled her to couquer, eoabled her also to re
cover; and /he now presentS a more flourifii
ing condition, and a more happy and har
monized foci ty under th t lyitem -of go
vernment, thrn any country in the world
c.m boast tmder any other. Her town:
are rebuilt, much better than before ; het
farms and plantations are in higher improve
ment than ever ; her commerce is spread
over the world, & her funds have risen froir
lef3 than ten pounds the hundred to up
wards of one hundred & twenty. Mr. Piti
and his colleagues, talk of the things that
lnve happened in his boyifn administration,
without knowing what greater things havt
happened elsewhere, and under other fyf.
terns ofgovernrhent.
I next come to state the expence o!
the two systems, as they now Hand in eacf
of th? countries ; but it may firft be pro
per to observe, that government in Ameri
ca is what it ought to be, a matter of ho
nor and tract, and not rr*dc a trade of foi
the purpose of lucre.
The whole amount of the nett taxes ir
England (exclusive of the expence of col
lection, of drawbacks, of seizures and con
demnations, of fines and penalties, of feet
of office, of litigations and informers, vvhicl:
are some of the blefied means ofinforcing
(hem) is feventeeii millions. Of this film,
about nine millioni go for the payment o]
the interest of the national debt, and the
remainder, being about eight millions, is
for the current annual expenees. Thus
much for one fide of the cafe. 1 now come
to the other.

jll account of the inctir,ions of the In
dians on the back fettfemer.ts, Congress
are, at this time, obliged to keep 6000
militia in pay, in addition to a reg'ment
of foot, and a i>attf.ll on of ai tillery,- which
it always keeps ; and this fncfeifes the
expence of the war depar'mcnt to 390,600'
dollars, which is 87,7951 sterling, hut
when peace shall be con-ludcd with the
Indians, the greate.l part of this eipence>
wiilceaf, anJ the total amount of the ex
pence of government, including that ftf thd
srmy, wil) amount to one hundred thou
sand pounds sterling, Ahicht, as has been,
already stated, is but an eighteenth patt of?
the expence of the English government.
I rcqueft Mr. Adam and Mr. Dundaj,
and all tliofe who are talking of confiitu
'ions, and blessings, and kings, and Lo<-ds;
the Lord knows what, to look at this
statement. Here is a fc-t-m and fyrtem
government, that is bett< Organised and
better adminillred than any government in
the world, and that for less than one hun
dred thoufanjpounds per annum, and vet
every member of Congress reteives, a's a
compenfatidn for his time and attendance
on public business, one pound seven fhil
i'.ng per day, which is at the rate of nearly
live hundred pounds a year.
This is a go-Jernmcnt that has nothing
to fear. It needs no proclamations to de
ter people from writing and reading. It
rreeds no political fuperltition to support it.
It was by encouraging difstiffion', and ren
dering the press free upon all fubjefts of
government, that the principles of govern
ment became understood in America, and
the people are now enjoying the present
hi effing under it. You hear of no riots,
tumults and disorders in that country ;
because there exists no' caufc to produce
them. Those things are never the effeÂ£fc
nf freedom, but of restraint, oppression
and excessive taxation.
In America there is not that class 0/
po6r and wretched peop'e thit are so me
meroufly dispersed all over England, and
who are to be told by a proclamotiOny that
they are happy ; and this is irr a great
measure to be acconnffcd for, no: by the
difference of proclamations, but bv the
difference of governments and the differ
ence of taxes Set v. eon that country and thisj
What tilt labouring people of that coun
t'y earn they apply to their own u/Y, and
to the education Of their children'; and do
not pay it away i:i taxes as; fail as they can
earn it, to support court extravagance,
and a long enormous lift of placemen and
pensioners ; and besides this, thty liave
learned the manly doctrine of reverencing
themfeivc, and confcquently 6f fefpefting
each other j and, they bugh St those itna
g nary beings called Kings and Lords,and
all the fraudulent trunipary of courts.When placemen and penfioncrs, or thcfe
who exptft to be such, are lavifli in praise
of a government, it is not a sign of its be-
a good one. Ihe penfion-!i[t alone in
England (fee Sir John Sinclair's hiliory
of the revenue, page 6 of the appendix)
is one hundred and seven thoufaud four
hundred and four pounds, which is more
than'the expences of the whole government
of America amounts to. And lam now
mo: e convinced than before, that the oflcr
that was made to me of a thousand pounds,
for the cupv-right of the second part ot
the Righo of Man, together with the re
maining copyright of the firlt part, was to
have effe&ed, by a quick suppression, what
is now attempted to be done by a prose
cution. The conne&ion which the person
who made that offer, has with the King's
printing-office, may furnifh part of the
means of enquiring into this affair, when
the miniflry fiiall pieafe to bring their pro
se ution to iflue. But to return to my
fubjeftâ
I have said in the second part of R'ghts
of Man and I repeat it here, that the fei
vice of any man, whether called King,
President, Senator, Legislator, or any
thing else, cannot be worth more to any
country, in the regular rotine of office,
than ten thousand pounds per annum We
have a better man in America, and more
of a gentleman than any king I ever knew
of, who does not occal'lon even halt that
expence ; for though the salary is fixed at
56251 he does not accept it ; and it is on
ly the incidental expences are pÂ«id out ol
it. The name by which a man is called,
is, of itfelf, but an empty thing. It i:
worth and character alone which can ren
der him valuable, for without these, kings,
.and lords, and prelidents, pre but jingling
names
But without troubling myfelf about
conllitutions of government, 1 have fhewi
in the second part of Rights of Man, thai
an alliance may be fotmed between Eng
land France, and America, and that iht
txpenfes of government in England may
be put back to one million and an half,viz.
Civil exper.ee of government 00c
Army 500,00 c
Navy 500,00 c
1,500,00 c
And even this sum is fifteen times great
cr than the expences of government are in
America ; and it is also greater than the
whole peace establishment of England a
mountea to about an hundred years ago
So much has the weight and oppression ol
taxes encreafed since the revolution, anc
especially since the year 17 14.
To shew that the sum of 500,000!. i:
fuffici. Nt to defray all the civil expences o:
guvernment, I have, in that work, annex
ed the following eilimate for any country
of the fame extent as England.
In the firft place, 300 reprrfentatives,
fairly elected, are fufficient for all the put.
poses to which legifl tion can apply, ant
preferable to a larger number.
If then an allowance, at the rate ol
5001. per an. be made to every representa
tive, deducing for non-attendance the ex
pence, if the whole number attended fix
months, each year would be 75>Â°Â®-
The official departments could not
possibly exceed the following
number with the salaries annex
ed, viz.
Th'ec officers at io,oool. each, 30,00 c
Teo do. at 5,000). each, 50,000
Twenty do. at 2.0001 each, 40,00 c
Forty do. at lyoool. each, 40,00 c
Two hundred do. at 50C1I. each, 100,000
Three hundred do at 20 1. each, 60,000
Five hundred do. at tool, each, 50,000
Seven hundred do.at 751, each, 52,500
_ Â£-4-9?>S OO
If a nation chose, it might tleduft
four per cent, from all the offices, and
make one of twenty thousand pounds per
annnm, and ttile the perlon who should
fill it, King or Majelty, or Madjefty, or
give him any other title.
Taking, however, this-fum of one mil
lion and an 'half, as an abundant supply
for all the expences of government under
any form whatever, there will remain a
surplus of nearly fix million and a half
out of the present taxes, after paying the
int<reft of the national debt ; and I have
shewn in the second part of the Rights
of Man, what appears to me the best mode
of applying the surplus money ; for I am
now speaking of expences and savings, and
not of fyllems of government.
I have in the firlt p ; ace estimated the
poor rates at two millions annually, and
tt Â° ff "ifual (!:â¢*> would be
to abol fh the poor rates entirely (which
would be a favmg of two millions to the
house keepers) and to remit four million
out of the surplus taxes to the poor to be
paid to them in money, in proportion to
the number of children in each family, and
the number of aged persons.
I have ellimated the number of persona
of both sexes in England of fifty years of
age and upwards at 420,000. and have ta
ken one third of this number, viz. 140,000
to be poor people.
To save long calculations, I have taker
70,000 of them to be Upwards of 50 years
jf age, and under 60 ; and the other tc
be 60 yeats, and upwards : and to allow 6
pounds per an. to the former class, and ic
rounds per an. to the latter. The ex
pence of which will be.
70,000 persons at 61. per an. 420,00 c
Do. do. atiol per an. 700,00 c
Â£.1,120, 00c
There will then remain of the four mil
ions, 2,880,000. I have Hated two diffe
ent methods of appropriating this money.
The one is, to pay it in proportion to the
lumber of children in each family, at the
ate of 3 or 4 pounds per annum for eacli
,-hild ; the other is, to apportion it accord
rig to the expence of living in different
:ountries ; but in either of these cases ii
ivould, together with the allowance to bi
made to the aged, completely takeoff taxe.
from one third of all the families in Eng
land, besides relieving all the other fami
lies from the burthen of poor rates.
The whole number of families in Eng
land, alotting five fou'.s to each family, i
1,400,000. of which I take one third, viz
466,666 to be poor families, who nou
pay four million of taxes, and that the
poorest pays at least four guineas a year 1
and that the other thirteen millions art
paid by the other two thirds. The plan
therefore, as dated in the work, is, ill. tc
remit or repay, as is already stated, thii
film of four millions to the poor, because il
is impoffihle to separate them from tht
others in the present mode of
taxes on articles of consumption ; and, 2d
to abolilh the poor rates, the house ani
window light tax, and to change the com.
mutation tax into a progressive tax,on larg<
estates, the particulars of all which are set
forth in the work,and to which I desire Mr
Adam to refer for particulars. I shall hert
conteqt myfelf with faying, that, to a towr
of the population of Manchester, it wil
make a difference in its favor, comparec
with the present slate of things, of upward;
of 50,000 pounds annually, and so in pro
portion to all other places throughout tin
nation. This, certainly, is of moreconfe
quence, than that the fame sums should be
colkdtcd to be afterwards spent by riotoui
and profligate courtiers, and in nightly re
vels at the Star and Garter tavern, Pa!
Mall. â¢,
I will conclude this part of my lettei
with an extract from the second part o
Rights of Man which Mr. Dundas (e
man rolling i luxury at the expence o
the nation) has branded with the epithel
of "wicked."
"By the operation of this plan, the pool
law 3, those inftrument# of civil torture,
will be fuperceded, and the watleful ex
pence oflitigation prevented. The hearts
of the humane will not be (hocked by
ragged and hungry children, and persons
of seventy and eighty years of age beg
ging for bread, The dying poor will not
be dragged from place to place, to breathe
their last, as a reprisal of parish upon parish
Widows will have a maintenance for their
children, and not be carted away on the
death of their husbands, like culprits and
criminals, and children will no longer be
conlidered as encreafing the diltrefTes ol
their parents. The haunts of the wretch
ed will be known, because it will be tc
their advantage, and the number of pet
ty crimes, the offspring of poverty and
distress, will be lcfTened. The poor, as
well as the rich, will then be interefled in
the support of government, and the cause
and apprehension of riots and tumu'ts will
cease. Ye who fit in ease, and folate
yourfelf in plenty, and such there are in
Turkey and Rnflia, as well as in England,
and who fay to yourselves. are we not well
off? Have ye thought of these things?
When ye do, ye will cease to speak and
feel for yourselves alone."
R.ghts of Man. Part 11. pap-e 136.
As er this remiflion of four millions be
made, and the poor rates and house and
window light tax be abolilhed, and the
commutation tax changed, there will (till
remain nearly one million an i an half of
surplus taxTS ; and as, by an alliance be â 
tween England, Fiance and America, ar
mies and navies will, in a great measure,
be rendered unneceffafy,|and as men, who
have either been brought lip in, or long ha
bited to, those lines of life, are it ill citi
zens of a nation in common with the relt,
and have a right to participate in all plans
of national benefit, it is stated in that work
(Rights of Man, part II.) to apply annu
ally 507,0001. out of the surplus taxes to
this purpose, in the following manner :
To 15,000 disbanded soldiers 3s. per week,
clear of deductions, during life 117,000
Additional pay to the remaining sol
diers per annum - - 19,500
To the officers of the difÂ«anded corps,
during life, the fame sum of 1.17,000
To 15,000difbanded sailors, 3s. per
week during life - - 117,000
Additional pay to remainingfailors 19,003
To the officers of the disbanded part
of the navy, during life - 117,000
Â£. 507,000
Tile limits to which it is proper to confine
his letter, will not admit of my entering
uto further particulars. 1 address it to
Vlr. Duhda.% fcfecaufe iie took the lead in the
lebate, and he wlfhes, I suppose, to appear
:anfpicuous ; but the purport of it is to ju,'-
:ify rayfelf from the cliarge which Mr.
Adam has made.
This gentleman, as has been observed in
he begin ding of this letter, conliders the
writings of Harrington, More, and Hume,
as jultifiable and legal publications, because
they reaibned by comparison, though in so
doing they shewed plans and fyftem< of go
vernment, not only different from, hut pre
ferable to. that orEngland ; and he accuses
me of endeavoring to confufe, instead of
producing a system in the room of that
which I had reasoned ajjainft; whereas the
fait is, that 1 have not only reasoned by com
parison of the representative fyliem against
the hereditary fyltem, but I have gone fur
ther ; fori have produced an initance of a
government established entirely on the re
presentative system, under which greater
happinefi is en oyed, much fewer taxe; re
quired, and much higher credit is eftablilh
ed, than under the system of government
in England. The funds in England have
risen since the war oily, from 541. to 9 1.
and tney have been down, since the procla
mation, to 871. whereas the funds in Ame
rica rose in the mean time from iol. to 1201.
His charge againlt me of 'â¢ destroying e
very principle of subordination," is equally
as groundless, which even a'fingle para
graph from the work will prove, and which
I fliall here quote :
" formerly, when divisions arose reflect
ing governments, recourse was had to the
sword, and a civil war ensued. That sa
vage custom is exploded by the new system,
and recourse is had to a nat.onal conven
tion. Discussion, and the general will, ar
bitrates the question, and to this, private o
piniori yields with a good grace, and order
is preserved uninterrupted." Rights o;
Man, Part 11. p. 173.
T hat two different charges fliould bÂ«
brought at the fame time, the one by a mem
ber of the legislature, for not doing a cer
tain thing, and the other by the attorney
general for doing it, is a strange jumble ol
contradictions. I have now jultified my
felf, or the work rather, against the firft, bj
stating the cafe in this letter, and the justi
fication of the oilier will be undertaken 11
its proper place. But in any cafe the wort
will go on.
I lhall now conclude this letter, witl
faying, that the only objection 1 found a
gainlt the plan, and principles contained ii
the second part of the Rights of Man whei
I had written the book, was, that they wouli
beneficiallyintereft at least n ; nety-nine per
sons out of every hundred througlvout the
nation, and therefore would not leave fuf
ficient room for men to ait from the diret
aud dilinterefted principle of honor ; bu
the prosecution now commenced has ftjr
tunately removed that objection, and thi
approvers and protestors of that work nov
feel the immediate impulfeof honor, addei
to that of national iutereft.

AN ACTION WITH THE AIJSTRIANS. -
Letter from La Fayette to the Minis
ter at War.
Enlrenchcd Camp at Mauieuge, June 11 âFourth
Year of Liberty.
" I now fit down, fir, to fend you an ac
count of the affair near Maubeuge. The
day before yefterriay, our light troops had a.
skirmish with those of the enemy, in which â 
the latter loft three meu, and a few on both
fides were wounded.
" The enemy attacked my advanced
guard this morning, which they doubtless
hopsd to surprize : but M. Gouvion, who
was informal of their intentions in good
time, sent off the ba'ggage towards Mau
beuge, and began a fkirmith during his re
treat, in which his infantry was continually
covered with hedges, and the enemy's co
lumns fuffered greatly frpm our artillery,
, and particularly from four pieces, d' Artili
erit a Chevat. under Captain Barrois.
" The 3d and nth regiments of Chas
seurs, and the 2d of HufTars, manoeuvred
most admirably ; the latter cut up a de
tachment of Hulans which advanced against
it.
" A violent storm, that prevented us
from hearing the signal guns, retarded our
knowledge of the attack. The moment
intelligence of it was received in our camp,
a column of infantry under M. Ligneville,
and another of cavalry under M. Tracy,,
were conduced by M. Narbon, towards
the enemy's left flank, while the reserve,
led on by M. Mauberg, advanced to the
succour of the advanced guard.
" I immediately ordered nine troops to
advance, and the enemy, after abandoning
the field of battle to us, and also part of
their killed aud wounded, retreated to their
former camp.
"We marched upwards of a league be
yond the ftatio 1 Formerly occupied by the
advanced guard, which lefumed all its for
mer polls.
11 t fliould have felicitated myfelf with
the little success accruing from this attack,
if it had not by a most cruel fatality been
the means of fnatchingfrom his country one
of the best of citizens, from the army, one
of the molt ufeful officers, and from myfelf,
a friend of no less than fifteen years stand
ing. f mean M. Gouvion, whose virtuous
life was terminated by a shot from a cannon.
He is bewailed by the foldiers,and by all the
army, and indeed by every body conscious
of the value of pure patriotism, an unalter
able faith. and tiie happy union of courage
and abilities. I speak not of mv personal
chagrin on this occasion, my friends will pi
ty me.
" The loss of two lieutenant-colonels of
the department of Cote d'Or, also call for my
just regret ; one was M Cazotte, aged 75,
who had seen 50 years of service : he was
killed ill the late affair, while assisting M.
Gouvion to save a difmounfed cannon.
" Tl>e remainder of our loss consists in
25 wounded ; the number of the killed is
inconsiderable. The en ;ny has fuffered
much more conftderably than 11s. We have
made some prisoners. and 1 have received
no account of any being taken on our fide.
" This is the most exact relation that I
am able toranfmit you, previous to the re
. ceipt of official and authentic accounts.

On this article we have only to observe,
that the Leyden Gazette, from which it is
taken, cautiously avoids naming the court
of Berlin, the court certainly alluded to,
which is ealiiy accounted for by the con
nexion between the king of Pruflia and the
Stadtholder : that the revolution mean, the
removal of Bilhopfwerden, and his party,
from tiie administration , and that the prin
cipal consequence will be a complete change
in the lyftcin of politics, the protection of
Poland against Ruilia, and the diflolutionof
the concert with Auftrin against France.
It was not likely to be inserted in the
Leyden Gazette without fonie foundation ;
but we have no direst affiirai.ee of its au
thenticity.
The court of Vienna is said at length to

A writer in a Virginia paper make; the
following observations in an adclrfcfs to Mr.
Hanks, of Richmond :â" 1 am equally a

neither the voice of the people is attended
to, or their intercUs confultvd. The ru

interell from tha. ol the penple ; if this be
the cÂ»l'e, (and I fear 1 am not deceived)
tyranny mud inevitably enliie. The evil
we fuller from the general government,
hive become infbppoftttble; an excise is
laid, an iniquitous and Qppreflive tax ; op
preffivr, because :is a tax on labour; and
iniquitottl, because it is a partial one : A
funding system is edabliflied calculated to
enrich a few (peculators on the small pit
tance of the soldier, who had aright to ex
peit from Gongrefs fonie sympathy, and
from whoft li i'pofed integrity, he could
apprehend no wrongâAn assumption of the
state debts has taken place, an unjust law,
as the remonstrance of the Virginia afl'enibly
will evince. Lib frty dwells not in that
country, where an excise is fuffered ; where
a national debt Is looked upon as a national
blelling ; and where the liberty of the pref
is rdtriited. Our taxes luve now become
hurtheufome, and rendered perpetual ; not
withstanding this, were the causes which
produced thnn just, there is too much vir
tue in Americans to complain : Submiflion.
however, to wicked and unjust laws, doe
not prove a right to pa(s then). Of two e
vils it is molt ndvilcable to choose the teaft :
submission is fomctimes a Idler evil rliau op
polition ; but when our fubmiflton is incon
sistent with the liberty and interest of the
country, our duty commands us to oppose.
In such a fitu-ition, the condui! of a people
ought to be influenced by a regard for their
freedom and happiness. The experience
of every country clearly deinonltraies, that
arbitrary power once eitablllhed, even ovei
the bravell of nations, they quickly degene

Lord Cornwallis has great pleafnre in an
nouncing to the army, that preliminaries of
peace have been fettled between the con
federate powers and Tippoo Sultan, con
taining conditions highly honorable and ad
vantageous to the Company, and the Bri
lilli nation ; and in confitleration of the un

ney, from the sum that 'l'ippoo has bound
himfelf to pay to the company. It has been
agreed that from this day hostilities fliall
. cafe on both fides, but the army is not on
ly to retain its prefcnt pods till further or

the (trongeft mtitmer, that 110 troops nor
persons belonging to Tippoo fliall be allow
ed to pais the piquet and approach the en
lampment without apallpon or perm'dlion
regularly notified, and in general, that the
fame vigilance and ftrirtneft that has been
cullotnary during the war, lhall be observed
by all officers and soldiers in the execution
of eve ry military duty, until the troop
fliall arrive at the poll that lhall be allotted
10 them, in the company's territories. His
lordlhip thinks it almost unneceil'ary to de
lire the army to advert, that moderation in
luccefs, is no left expected from brave men,
than gallantry in ait ion, and he trulls that
Ihe oliicer and foldler in his army, will not
only be incapable of committing violences
in any intercourse that may happen between
them and Tippoo's troops, but that they
will even abstain from making use of any
kind of an infnlting exprellion towards an

REMAKKS on a late authentic Document, pub*
lifted by the Treasury Department, under
thefignutureof ]oSV.\>H NouÃsk, Re/sister.*
Ttlr. object of this publication seems to
be, to impress the public miiul with a
belief, that utuler the present aclminiftra
tion of its fifcal concerns, the public debt has
been afttially reduced to the amount of
1,8.15,2r7 dols. and 4J cents ; and that the
sum of 397,024 Jols. and 15 cents remain*
to be applied to the fame object. That this
is not the cafe, but that the public debt, in
(lead of being diniiniflied one farthing, lias
been really augmented to the amount of
upwards of one million and a half dollars, lince
the present adminiltration commenced, will
1 think manifeftly, appear by a reference to
a few plain facts and documents not less au
thentic than the one ligtled by Mr. Nourfe.
The Secretary of the Treasury in a re
port to Congress, dated 23d January, 1792,
(hites that the whole expenditures or de
mands against the government from the be
ginning of the year 179.1, to the end of tile
year 1792, amount to dols. 7,088,197. 74
That the amount of the nett
prod ufl of tile public revenues
during the years 1791 & t"/y2 is 7Â» 0a 9Â»755-
Leaving as a deficiency against
the government dols. 52,442-
It apears by Mr. Nourfe'sdocument, that
the whole amount of the revenues of the
United States from the time the firtt impost
law took elfeit, which was the ill Â«t Augult
1789) until the 31ft. Dec. 1790, was
dols. 3,026,070. OS
That the total demands up
on that, agreeable to the ap
propriations made byCongrefs,
exclusive of any interest 011 thtT
public debt, was - 1,687,194.81
Leaving a surplus in favour of
the revenue, of dols. 1,3381875-84
It appears too, from Mr. Nourfe's docu
ment, that the treasury department claims
credit for having disposed of the laid surplus
of 1,338,875. 84, so as to purchase and re
deem to the amount of 1,845,81 7- 4 â  of the
public debt, and to have left 397,024 dollars
and 15 cents to be applied to the lame obÂ»
jett.âHe it so ; I admit the faftin itsfullelt
forceâbut what follows ? That it the trea
sury claims credit lor the tile and whole a
niount of the revenue of the United States,
from its sommcnccment 011 the Ift of Alia.
1789, to the 31 ft of Dec. 1790, towards l<M -
fening the public credit ; so it ougjit to be
debited with the whole amount of ihe in
terell, that accrued ou the public debt, du
ring the fame period, which by the treasury
returns amounts to 4,036,959 dols. and 19
cents. lam aware that in objection to this
it will be laid, that agreeable'to the ast of

ALFRED is mentioned as the founder of the
Briiilh navy, fÂ»om his having oppoled the incui
lions of the Danes on their favorite element with
success, but the reign of Elizabeth; was the fnft
period in which the tnglifh power became res
peCtable at sea. In the reign of Henry VIII. that
piince, in order to ft: out 0 navy, wa* obliged to
hire Ihips from Hambutgh, Lubec, Dantzic, Ge
noa, and Venice. ElizaLetn, howevei, builr
some Ihips of war hcileif, and ehcouraged the
merchants to conftrudt larger trading velfels than
were then used, which, on occasion, were eafi!)
converted into fighting ships. 1* J 509, on the
alarm of the Spaniih invafton, the Qneen equip
ped a fleet and levied an army in a fortnight
to oppoft them. This sudden armament gave fo
te'igners an high idda of the resources of England
at that period;
At Elizabeth's death, the nurhbef of (hips of
war amounted to forty-two. This appears a na
vy of lome consequence, but. compared with the
importance it has lince attained, was very con
temptible, especially when it is considered that
none of the above vefTelt carried maie than foi ty
guns, and four only were of the number. There
vwere but two of a thousand tons burthen, twenty
three below five hundred, forme of filtyj and a lew
of not more than twenty tons, the whole nutnbei
of guns ' elonging to the ffret being only levei

of the neceflity of the measure, and called upon
