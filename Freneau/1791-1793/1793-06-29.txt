remarks*
"From the Boftan Independent Chro
nic Â£E of" June 20.]
By the last accoiints, the situation of
[he French armies, it will be remembered,
was not thoroughly underltood; either up
on thy P.hine, of which the.cities ot Mentz
and Lan Jan, are the principal fortificati
ons; or in Flanders, of which Lisle, Valen
ciennes and Conde, are the garrisons. I t
was not even certain, whether the deiecti
on of their late general, DtJMOUiIIER, had
not extended its baneful influence to thele
places, so as to facilitate their fu render
ing to the Auftrians, of which theÃritilh
pipers had announced the probability-
Nothing ofthis nature however, appears
cu have taken ett'eft, by the present intelli
gence.âOn the other hand, the numbers
us 'he troops in either of them, were lup
jiofed by the national conmrnilliuners, fut
ficient to hold a'long and obliinate Iwge,
if not wholly to IVullrate the intentions of
the Gennan army. The battaliions of
France were recruiting tsft on the Iron
tiers, and the soldier; discovered in their
daily fkirmilhing, and in some actions of
magnitude, themoft heroic courage- He
roic we call itâbecanfe the official ac
counts of the prince of SaXe Cobourg ac
knowledges it to have been obstinateâ
an exprefiion of the utnioft force in the
mou.hofan enemy. The French indeed
like the Americans, have waflied-away the
slain of of imputed co'-vardice, with the
blood of their enemies.
It appears by these papers, that the Ger
mans are negociating by proclamation;,
which change the .ground in favour ol the
<iitacuhiea-ia- the of
jfUire fubjugatiou, augment. What, for
;x.ample, is more oppoiite than t'ne de
tlaratioas of the duke of Bruufwick and
he prince CobourgâOne was to burn and
Jeftroy Paris,if even one of the royal fami
y was injured. The latter willies for
upon the terms and ltipulations of
.lie 3rd constitution which the people had
adopted, and which aboliflies all the pri
vileged ordersâlt wasjnft so in America
âIn the firfl place, unconditional fubmif
lon. was offeredâthen conditional: and
ifte.-wards unconditional independence. â
Pray heaven, the event may be the fame
with the French, as the happiness of the
world, the exilteuce of civil li-
Deitj, even here,depends upon their main
taining their freedom.
In one of the English papers,
;hat the Germans have loft by action, tick
nefi'es. death and desertion, at 'east a third
:>f their army, si.ice the campaign opened
in February lall.
I t is certain at any rate, that some of the
battles were severe -and bloody; and
rvery body kfiows the dangers the health
jf foldicrs is exposeS to by their being early
.11 the field-
The accounts of tke commiflioners,
three of whom have tarried in the garri
on of Mentz, arc very favourable, ami
their presence will, no doubt, inspire the
"ojdiers with courage.
The vigorous proceedings of the conven
tion, in the punishment of the aristocrats,
â¢nid the fupprefiion of the rebels in Britta
ny, promises much to tile future security
of the republic.
It has been the policy of such characters,
confiding of the old nobility, or then
friends and dependants, to plead the con
flitutional authorities, to confound am
disorganize every thin;'. But moll ol
these persons have been seized, their in
trigues discovered, and their conlairacie:
fupprefled.
The combination of powers is more it
name than reality. One of the aijadu
camp of general Dumourier, has declare;
at the bar of the Afiembly* tljat the ene
mies of France difagrec' It is very cer
tain that every league of tlefpots to con
quer their enemies, has hitherto provad tt
be abortive, from the etvefts of \ ariot.s anc
dlfcordaht interests, which do not.fait tc
appear upon any material disappointment.
The profpert of famine in Franc.', with
which the Kritifh appear to have felici , -
ted themselves, is not now spoken of, cy
which we may conclude, that all their
hopes of such a dreadful calamity is nigh
at an end, The policy of the JSmifh i;abi
indeed Teems to lie in trying to ftarvc
li e womt' i and children of France, in or
ilcrto conquer th? men. But while they
are thus meditating all manner of evils
by Sre and sword, death and peltilence, to
ruin tl:'cattle of liberty in France, they
are arretted by diltrefies of a touching and
peculiar nature, in their own country.
It seems by the immense floods of paper,
and tlieiu jiier cxtention Â«,f credit, that
they have raised the quantity of their bills
uu't us all proportion to the money which
rcprefents them. Tlvs circumllance, and
the alarm it has occalioned among the
bankers, together with theftoppage of ex
ports to France, have checked their manu
faiturcs, anil have inundated the mer
chants with goods for which they have lit
.'ent. In ionfesjuence-of this, all trnit am:
.onfidetic.* betwe. n man and man is ;o to
:ally at tin end, that credit, (du* main
pring.of the British cotfilucrce) is slmoi
vholly at a. Hand âFailures, in number and
imonnt, beyond imagination, have iSkffn
ilate in tom'equeme; and all persons are
uminatitt;* with aiianillimenf, upon tile
lpvehy apd ditlrefs of theii (ituatioii, and
lpoti the means of relieving it. Hitherto
he only expedient propol'ed in parliament,
s worse than the evil it is intended to cor
â eft. For it obliges the borrower to de
jolit goqda to twice the amount of the
uin lie receives, and thus reduces him to
lie neceifty of giving the most "exorbitant
>reinium tor tne money he may takej as
iie liiuftiof these commodities to be depo
ned, are articles of trade, which he has
inquired upon credit, at the customary in
ereft cfj per centum a yrar. The go
ernrae.-.t af'rer all this, gives nothing but
>;!per, which is still add ng to t(ie mat's by
,vhuh credit has been oppressed, and the
irefent evils created.
But if we have not these particulars de
ailed as full length in their parliamentary
lebatea*.; the letter of Geti. Cobourg if
he ftropgeft evidence of forae calamity
.â¢xlftr; lie WUiffgtent powti of
i very ferioua nature ; for he has cojiftfieJ

Two French privateers were taken ar.cl

.vhich had captured prizes from the Brit

It was never known what Duclie the
Chaplain of Congress received'for his trea

:o betray the garrison at VV'elt Point.
The French have fix millions of livre:
allotted for secret service money, the enfn

Lirctimfiance may turn the tables, and con

There is a very remarkable clrcum
ftance in the BriiHli, which cannot fail ol
[iriking the mind of every American as s
most prominent and distinguishing feature
ii their national character : Their oppoli
tion to the French, is so great, that thev
would not go even to Heaven itfelf, if the
French were upon the fame i o.id .vitl
themâthis is fully exemplified in all theii
daily publications ; for every newfpapci
teems with the moil cruel reproaches a
lainft the French for their zeal in defence
of their cause, and the resolution wit!
which they fuppdrt it ; Whereas formerly,
these very Frenchmen weie represented b)
them as slaves, unworthy the character oj
men, and the objects, 0:1 that account, oj
their utmost Icorh and indignation.
The French, on the other hand, seem t<-
invigoratein their efforts, and to lfrength
en in their resolutions.
Blancheland, the late governor of St.
Domingo, lias been convicted of treafct
against the republic, after a trial of 4:
hours, before -a jury, by the unanimou:
fuftrages of the court ; and yet,the ivifto
ci'ats of France, icattcred over Eng'nnd
and America, and who have no other em
ployment, are racking their inventions t>
jive a falfe colour to this, and every trnnf
aftion or' moment, to excite the prejudice
.if the honest and unreflecting, against the
French; just as the American refugees at
N'ew-Yoik and 111 England, in the late
ivar, were fabricating every calumny to
[Total Numb. 174.7
defame their own countrymen, of which
every American is fully sensible.
The molt alarming consequences \yere

manufa&urers, who were out of employ
ment on account of the war. In Scotland
it was, (aid i'o less than 160,000 persons

irom t!]e fame cause.
On the whole, the Ruffians {land aloofâ
the Dutch are inactive as usual, the Spani
ards counting their beads, and trembling;
for the fate of their galleonsâthe Pri<fiians
remote, cautious, and occupied with .their
la.e acquisitions in Polandâthe Aultrians
alone fighting this campaign, a*, the Prufii

Some accounts mention a duel l-etw ecu

of their intelleSs, we can scarcely believe
:hey have given this proof of their folly. -

Mr. Frinead,
-pHERE is an axiom laid down in private
lite, and another in politics, which
lave some fimilai'.ty, and may conjunelly
ipply to the llate of Georgia, at this awtut
unihire of her fate, in which it is pofiib'e
he late of the United States may beimol
ret\. The private axiom is, that the ciick
jlii is the last man in the pari.lt who per
ceives his own horns : the public one, that
10 man can tread down the bulwark of li
jerryTOspprhvis-poj/tilw-in-th* txtrsflu-.
The slate of Georgia has bee .i repeated
y injured and insulted in the groff.lt Inan

he artful knavery of the aristocratic junto
lere and theftrange (lupidity of too many
jf the yeomanry, that a great name gilds
very pill, which, however noxious, is
'wallowed with avidity.
It is high time the United States fhou'tf
enquire what fort of government they are
liitlerâls it republican ? Is it ariftocratf
:alâor, is it monarchical ?
It is not republican. If it Wai, we
hould not have seen ftich a Proclamation*
is appears by the pub ic prints to have
acen done at the city of Philadelphia on
12th of December last, offering joodollsrs
reward for each of the persons concerned
n killing certain Indians of the Cherokee
nation.
The infant state of Georgia swallowed
the federal coi fHtution. with, so voracious
m appetite that like the glutton with bis
syliers, fhetook not time to examine whtÂ«
ther they Were milky or not, till they pro
duced fiicli a uaufea, as to iucfine thp poor

There were not wanting at that period

wifbed for the eltablrfhrtient 0! a govern

reptile qualities of the mindwould exalt
them into public consequence, wherein
they might turn their abilities to the bell
advantage poflibleâand to deceive the ig
norant majority they wirifpered in their
ears* that "nothing but the adoption of the
federal conffitution could save the Rate
from political damnation." Two only iu
tMe convention oppof<?d its adoption, but so
badly did they manage the matter, that
notwithllanding their opposition, the vote
palfed the houfc on the fatal moruir.g, he*
mint! contradict'),
At that day the bulk of the people of
Georgia, might have been aptly compared
to a child agreeing to burn its finger for a
ginger cake. The child had not sense
enough to d.fcoier that the smart was to
continue after the fitiger was withdrawn
from the blaze. The Georgia convention
(aveiy few excepted) had jnfl as much po
litical knowledge as would balance the
child's ideas <jf the effetts of fire.
The state of Georgia, a frontier, had,
for many years fufFrred grievously by the
depredations of the Indians. The federal

B ,>iiold the salutary effects of a royal man
date appearing in form of a proclamation
The prefatory part of it is fufficieiit tc
condemn the relitfue. Authentic informa
tion could not have been received, becault
to be authentic it wasnectffary it Ihould be
true. Hearken then to the voice of truth :
A militia officer, living o.i the wellerr
frontier of Georgia, had some horses car
ried off by a party of Cherokee Indians. A
few of his neighbours were killed, several
Jloules burnt, and a confulerable quantity
of Rock carried off from various people by
those rejpettabLe aborigines of this ill fated
country. He collected afew of his militia,
pursued the murderers, palied several In
dian towns without moleiling any of the
inhabitants, am! finally arrived at that in
"which the holtilefavages had taken refuge.
This hollile town he laid in alhes, as any
other good soldier would have done under
like circumflances, killed as many ot the
red men as he could come at there, and
then returned home, palling again in the
mod peaceable manner tnro' their towns,
when he had it in his povver to annihilate
them and their inhabitants.
This ofilcer had been generally aÂ£live in
Juppreffing the violent attempts of the In
<dians, which thwarting the views of a few
of our oligarchical gentlemen, he was mark
ed out as a proper objeÂ£t on which to try
the validity of the proclamation. He wa
"taken into cnflody by the federal marlhai
for the district of Georgia, when he chose
to go forward to trial, conscious of his in
nocence, rather than yield to the solicita
tions of his friend? ; one hundred and fifty
of whom prefentcd themfeh es, and prof
fered to rele ife him by force.
This, with the court-party, will be an
additional inÃance of the Izwlefs difpolition
of the Georgians. Hut they areinillaken :
it was only a resuscitation of that patriotic
spirit which gave birth to the two battles of
Lexi'igton t-.nd Bunker' hill, and paved the
way to tn.ife exalted Rations in whichfome
now ifiine, who seem to forget that their
conference is wholly and totally from the
people, and that from tne current of their
breath it derives its exigence only.
As an extenuation of the condufl of the
federal government towards the United
States generally, and the Rate of Georgia
particularly, it cannot be denied but that
the people wear the yoke so tamely, that
ti â¢ plain inference to be drawn is. The
Almighty originally intended them for
Haves, and therefore did not endue them
"with mental faculties to support fnch a go
vernment as they had been tantalized with.
Solomon slept with his fathersâReho

duplicate of the tranfaSions of those days
may be copied into the pages of American

NEW-YORK, June 2;.
Copy of a let'cr from a gentleman in Wil
mington, N. Carolina, to the printers of
the Daily Advertiser, dated June 16,1793.
" On Thursday laR was brought into
this port, an Enelifh {loop called the Pro
vidence, from Montego Bay, James Ro
bertfon, mailer, a prize to the French pri
vateer Le Vainqueur de la BaÃille, Fran
cois Henry Hervieux, commanderâfiuce I
when the privateer has arrived.
" It appears that the Vainqueur de la
PaÃille. .ale the Hettcr of Philadelphia,
was ptirchafed in CharleÃon by captain
Hervieux (an officer in the French navy)
who having through the medium of the
co'fill ol the French Republic, redding in
CharleÃon, procured u commidion tor his
veflel, armed her. and having caused the
American papers belonging to the Hcctor
to be deposited in the enftom house in
Charleston, failed on a cruise.
" That between Cape Fear and Cape
Romaine, at the diflance of tour and an
half leagues from land, he fell in with the
Providence, which he captured after having
chafed her some time.
" Since capt. Hervieux's arrival, it hav
ing b.'en rumoured that a certain Gideon
Olinftea-d, formerly rlie owner of the Hcc
tor, had acted as an officcr on board the
French privateer, at the time of the cap
ture of the (loop ; although an American
citizen, two magistrates of the county,
in pursuance (as they supposed) of the pro
clamation of the P'-efident of the United
States, thought proper to illue their war
rant for the apprehending el' said Olmftead
âand upon examination, conceived the
evidence to I- e of a nature, ami his cafc and
situation such as deserved to be submitted
to the cognizance of the federal judiciary.
They accordingly caused Mr. Olmltend to
enter into a recognizance in the sum of two
hundred pounds, tor his appearance at the
next diftrift court, to be hoiden lor the di
itrict of North-Carolina, on the ftrll Mon
day in July next.
'â¢ Cipiain Hervieux is acknowledged to
have treated his prisoners with unusual
gen -rofity ; nor have they since their ar
rival in the harbor, been at all retrained
of their liberty.
" 'I'he captain of the Br'rtifh (loop, taking
advantage Of this indulgenee, availing him
felf of the countenance and suppOrt he has
received in this town, and by advice of
connfel, has instituted an action of trespass
againit the commander of the French pri
vateer and Mr. Olmftead, in the sum of
two thousand pounds, upon pretence that
the capture Was illegal.
" Vexatious 'as is this suit. it will cer
tainly be productive of the mo&L&Hous in-
captain Hervieux, (who is
still in the custody of the fheriff) and will
prob ibiy discourage that liberality in others
which has prompted his conduct in thiscir
cumftance ; since far from releasing their
prisoners with fpeec'y humanity, caution
will teach the French crmfers in future,
the neceflily of confining (at leatt) their
Eriglifti captives, 'till they reach the terri
tories of the French Republic, or until the
chance of war fhaU bring tlfeni relief and
liberty."

a:i inhabitant of Cayes, to Citizen GE
NET, dated Cheftertewn, June 9, 1793.
Citizen genet, minister of the French
rejrublic to the United States of Ame
"ica, in Philadelphia. âCitizen minister, I
lave seen with equal indignation and fur
irize the letter* written to you by the Civil
Santhonax and Polverel,
ind ain 110 less affected that out of compli
ance to them you have cavrfed it to be 111-
erted in the American newspapers. Its
abj-=-Â£t feems'to be to raise the fame preju
dices among the Americans* that these
entlemen availed themselves of in St. Do
ningo, against those emigranls wliram their
-,liud indignation pursued to these hofpita
jle shores. The character yon ha\e to
"uftain ought to ensure your impartiality ;
and since the civil conmiiffiotiers fland so
much in awe of the public opinion of this
country, as to endeavour to bewilder it by
fallhood and slander, I flatter myfeif that
you will not be offended with the pub
itation of this letter thfo' the fame channel
which conveyed yours to the world.
Let the American people know then,
that the far greater number of the St. Do
mingo emigrants have been nnder the ne
cessity of flying from the odious and abfurtJ
yranny which is enforced in that unhappy
country under the fanflion of the new re
public of France. Many ot them, and my
"elf of the number, have been compelled
o escape individually from a profcriptioa
he molt unnatural, executed without dif
:rimination. and the most unbridled licen
ioufuefs. They who know it not ought
0 be informed, that the fir ft constituting
lational aflembly, in order to alleviate int
liferent parts of the French dominions,
hose troubles which were inseparable front
1 great revolution, authorized the execu

Hilinefs it was to employ the must perfualive
neans to recall exasperated or mifinflÃrnitd
ninds to that love of peace, union, and e
]ualityT which in future (hould be the prin
:ipal foundation ol the new facial contract
)f France.
By the late revolutionary events of France,
hose civil commiifioncrs of St Donii' go
rausforined themselves into abfolutedi&a
ors, mid Tot themselves above all laws.â
!\n authority so absurd and exorbitant, it is
ivell known, can be no further tolerable in

declares itfelf the avowed proteflor ? Such,
however, has been the part acted by the

â¢ :p!y with a view to throw into the hands
in the mulattoes, by any means how violent
soever, every branch of the administrative
and governmental authority of the colony.
So far frarn that, the decree forbade them

except m.-n whon thejieopie elleemed anc
had confidence in.
If" it ttiould ? proved that the commis
sioners have fuffeved tjie aff'mblies of thv
communes to elect municipal officers, ther<.
are grounds to fay that it would have beet
equally cafv to aifemMe them foe the elec
tion of all other public o.Seers, whose no
mination is constitutionally vetted in the
people. The affcinbiy of the commune
might even have appointed delegates t<:
farm anotiier colonial aflVmbly and fend
deputies to the cdfivention. But perhap
the inulattoe party, of w yich the civil com
xniffioners have declared themselves the
patrons, were not the prevalent one.or per
rap3 it was the intention ofthefe legiffators
thit neither party (hould get the bitter of
the other, but to suspend them both, and
the rights of both, in perfeÂ£t equilibrium
However, there is not much to complain
of on this head ; for, by the firll nom na
tion,to which the unulattoes assented, there
was not a tingle municipal jurifdiftion in
the colony where they were not admitted,
pot .vith:Unding that at this period, in mo
of them the whites had a majoriry ; aid
this is a fufliciem proof of the submission ol
the 1 tter to the decree of the 4th of April,
a id of their dellre to concur by all possible
means in re-e!lablilliing peace The civii
commiflioners, theri, Mill always be under
the reproach of having been the firlt i.ifli
jjuorsofuur late troubles, and, as far a;
concernsth? citizens, having tyrannically
ut'urpvd all tlie pb.vers of government, and
in order t'' appr >priate th rm to themselves,
conlantly opposed the appointment of rie
legites, eith r to form a new afl'.mbly, or
to be feilt to the convention.
Such, citizen minister, are the truth:
which the ci* ,1 commitKoners hive not im
parted to vmi in their letter, and which are
jlf-vertheleTs necefTiry to he dd'clofed to the
A'tienc 1 is. ' 'hey "ought alto to be il
- that the â¢great crime of the com
mune of Port-au-Prine was,their dem Hid
ing the formation of a colonial a(Temb.y,
and for having agiintt their inclination,
th >* authorized by Ihe decree of {+>. 4th Â«1
April (as it authorized ail the other com
muies of the ilia id) proceeded to the
nomination of deputies for this aflembi)
a 111 to the national convention. It may be
DeceflVy to add, that the community ol
Cayes had tiie fame with for the
formation of filch an aflembly,and tor fend
ing to tile national convention.
This object of the whites was to enforce
that law of equ . whiclfthey had long
wÂ»hed Jor to :io purpose; an equ dity \ liici
could no longer be real/y.ed, li ice the mn
iattots, grown richer than the whites bj
pillage a id robbery, had inclined the bal
ance of wealth to their fide.
Such are the real motives of that general
p ofcciptioii of the white citizens mo-'l
dei oted to the evolution. This <onduÂ£l
of the coi iiniffioaers, doubtless, con
ceals another design which the mulattoei
: y not be aware of. but the effects ol
which they may yet feel as well as the
whites: this is 110 less than apian for the
general emancipation of the (laves.
After having fomented the troubles, giver
strength to anarchy, aided the revolts oi
the (laves, and reduced to alhes the produce
of the colorty ; and having, coufequently
ruined the national concern for the prefer-
Vation of this invaluable pofTeffion, would
it now be very difficult to perfu ide al:

"People in these parts seem determined
to have their hands no longer tied up from
exerting those abilities that God and na
rure have given tnem against Indian mur
ilerer, and incendiaries. Regular bodies
of cavalry are formed and forming, under
the auspices of the Itate Government, to

on such a plan as to relieve each other at

Newlpapcrs received from France contain
the details of the whole of Dumourier's
plot and tfeachery (theyfhall be fuccef-
Tively communicated.) By these it will
appear, that that infamous mail had con
ceived the project of eltrxying the inde

he was placed at the head of affairs, by
men as despicable as himfelf. Tâ whose

had employed in attempts to bribe those
whom they wiihed to bring over to their
interest, presented to the king,
as capable of directing him, and the choice
(hews, that he well knew how to select a
villain.
Dumourier, of an intriguing and ambi
tious difpulition, fcarcelv railed to the lta
tion to which he aspired, forgot his bene
factors. He believed, that lie could he
come all powerful, by wearing for a time
the maik of patriotifin ; having succeeded
1:1 his firft attempt, he determined to com
plete alone his ambitious plans; but he
was soon brought low again by those whom
he had forgot while fortune imiled.
Become more circumfpeft by this firft
fall, he felt the necessity of renewing his
connection with intriguers, whose power
he so sensibly felt when he was no longer
their accomplice. At the fame time he
resolved to rake vengeance 011 t'ne king, by
whom be thought himfelf injured; with
this view, instead of aorrefponding with
turn directly as the conftitutibn required of
commanders, he addressed his difpatcfies
to the national afTembly, and thus gave a
clue to the treasons of the court, to which
he was delirous, by making himfelf feared,
to become neceliary ;âBut the people
puftied matters further than they wishedâ

the king no longer ufeful to their designs,
abandoned him. T. went to England, he
was empowered to offer Dumourier's ser

TO THE PUBLIC.
HAVING attended carefully to the
reluit ot several comparative experi
ments, which were made to ascertain the
nature and meri s of Samuel Hopkins pro
cess for manufacturing pearl allies or calci
i,id alkaline salts, we are of opinion, that
by his method wood aires may he made tc
yield a quantity of pearl allies of a very
fine- white colour, equal in weight an.:
ftreneth to the black or uncalcmed alka
line salts which are obtained by the ordi
nary method of leaching and boiling dewi:
the 1 lack leys, so that the manufadtuiei
who adopts this method, will probably
.rain all the weight which is 101 l by the or
dinary proc.fs of calcining, and m;:y efleCi
tie calcination in a much eaf.er manner.
We also examined a furnace erected accor
tjjng to the direaionsot Samuel Hopkins,
and were present during part of a process
which wa,~ co< du<fted in it and believe ii
to be so happily conllru&ed as to effect tlu
calrina ion'of wood alhes, and evaporate
the leys without more fuel than is used te
boil down the leys only by the commoi
method.

In addition to the foregoing certificate
I conceive it proper 10 inform the public
in what refpe. my process differs from thi
uftial method, and to offer f..me direftiom
to such as may iucline to adopt it
lit. hi; jv i.cess confiiU in cacming

of a pecuiiar conduction lo contrived thai

ernes the alV.es ; hence it appears there 1:
nor a greatei enfumption of wood in thu
new process than is necessary in the former
in biaining black salts, ano the a'hes fron

2d I is 'ee.>mmended to such as m?j
adept this method, to pav particulai at
tent ion to the firll part of the pru.Ce s, viz
calcining the alhi s properly; for this being
carefully performed, the fubfrquent it<*p
become easy and i fs liable to fail.
3d. The alhes fnould be spread over th<
hearth of the turnace not more than on.
inch and anlialf thick, direst a lively blaz.
on them until they, beconv red hot, keep
ing them frequently stirred, and the dam
pers well cloieii.
4th In order that the workman ma)
know when his-afhea are fufficiently burr'
w ,til, he becomes enough perfect hi th<
bufmefs, from other circumtlances, a Imal
parcel may be taken out and put 111 aglaf:
with water, if the alhes fettle quickly aftei
stirring them, and the leys appear colour,
less, they ar<? fit for drawing into the all:
pit ; if ihey are calcined longer the quan
tity may he durtiHilhed.
eth. After the fires begin to burn, every
part of the furnace fhouid be kept as clole
as possible.the door of the ash pit and hearth,
and that for introducing the ashes cn the
he arth, Ihould be made to (hut complete,
for I have reaf 11 to believe a great draught
of air carries off much of the salts.
6th. Great cure Ihould be taken not tc
put more alhes into the furnace than I
have dirtfted above ; it has been found
b" experiments that when much more have
been put in, the faits are not so white not
the quantity so great. I believe it was
for want of attention to this circumstance
and allowing too great a draught of air,
that some who attempted my process have
not been so fuccefsful as was expeft^a.
7th. The alhes are drawn from the ail)
pit the next day ; after calcining and put
into leach tubs, the leys drawn from then
alter fettling ave boiled down, the fait:
kept well llirred in finifniiig off, until the)
become perfe&iy white.

Bth. If the salts fliculj not become the
colour as is described in the fi:ft instance,
through an imperfect calcination,
'.hey may be dissolved, fettlid, and boiled
down again.
The advantage arising from this pro
cess may beconipnied under the following
heads.
ill. By calcining the allies before the
leys are drawn from tliem, we obtain as
threat a quantity at lead ot pearl alhes, as
of common black falts;pearl ashes general
ly fell when at market ?.t 501 per to-i :
the highest price for black salts is 251. per
'on, and if converted ir.to pearl alhes, it
requires as much more labour and fuel r.s
in the fir ft instance, and a loss from 25 to
30 per cent.
The foregoing observations are intend
ed for such as are or m;iy be engaged in the
manufadturing of pot and pearl ashes; they
will cafily underfland the terms 1 have
employed ; for the information of others
it may not be amils to explain, what 1*
meant by bUck salts, pot alhes and pearl
ashes.
2d. Black salts are made by boiling
down the leys from common wood ashes,
until they ore perfectly dry.
3d. Pot alhes are made by melting the
black salts in a very itrong fire, and lading
it out into coolers.
4th. Pearl alhes are made by putting
the bl ck salts into a furnace prepared for
I hat purpose, and throwing a llrong b.aze
on them ; this operati on is cal ed fcorch
i.'g; they are then dissolved in water, fet
tled and boiled down 'again, returned back
into the furnace and calcined until they
are fufficiently white: Pot ashes made
from calcined ashes are allowed to be much
superior to those made in the cominoti
mode
I expect the names and characters oi
molt of my fellow c.tizens that have sign
ed the foregoing certificate are well known;
they are allowed tobe well acquainted with
chemillry. A furnace was ereÂ£led for
one of them, who kindly undertook to
make the neceflary comparative experi
ments, according to my directions ; the
result of which is-already let forth.

6th Mo. 22d, 1793.
I do certify, that I have crefkd a small
-furnace, in the suburbs of this city, op the
patent method, for the purpose of mi.nu-
LÂ£turir,g pot and pearl ashes, which T find
to consume on an average no more than
one cord of wood per week ; two 1 ands
will calcine 20 bushels of ashes per'day,
and bale down the leys therefrom hi the
lame time, which if well calcined will pro
duce pearl ash the firft boiling. Ihe
are not so apt to boil over as those in the
common method. âThe txpenfe of the
said furnace, excluflve of the boilers, did
not exceed ten pounds currency.

A gentleman on the South Fork 6' Sa
luda river, in a letter of the 23d uit. fends
his correspondent in this city tne following
defcripiion of an extraordinary animal
which has been lately discovered on the
Bald Mountain, and on other mountains
iu the Western Territory : â
This animal is between twelve and fifteen
feet high, and in shape refem'oling a lui
man being, exoept the head, which is in
equal proportion to its body, and draws in
iomewhat like a tarapin ; its feet is like
those of a negro, about two feet long, and
hairy, which is of a dark dun colour ; its
eyes are exceedingly large, and open and
(hut up and down its face ; the hair of its
head is about fix inches long, (lands itraight
like' a ueigroe's ; its nofc is like that of ti
human species, only large; and inclined to
what is called lloman.
These animjls are bold, and have lately
attempted to kill several personsâin which
attempts some of them have been (hot.
Their principal resort is on the Bald
Mountain, where they lie in w it for tra
vellersâbut foine have been seen in this
part of the country The inhabitants of
this plac call it Yahoo : the Indians, how
ever, give it the name of Chickly-Cudly.
