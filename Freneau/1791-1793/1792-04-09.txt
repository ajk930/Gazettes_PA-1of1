On the FU NDING SYSTEM.
OF all the evils nrifing from the I un<luit'
fylU in. none will be more severely lelt
by the people at large, than the conftani
tribute which the whole of the United States
will be forever laid under, to supply the
ftorkholddrs living in foreign country l 01
at the feat of government, with a regulai
receipt of their interest. t1 or when the ex
tenlivenefs of our country is considered, aiic
the many natural boundaries, which cut ol
;i commercial communication between the
V U'mil. parts, and the particular spot wher<
the feat of government may be fixed ; i
will be evident that the majority of tin
states will be constantly drained of then
circulating medium, to supply the Trca
fury of the United State* svirh money n
discharge an expensive civil lift, a heav\
public debt, and the contingencies arilm;
from the unforefeen events, to which tin
altVirs of nations, under the wifefl adminis
tration are always liable. And as theft
Continual drains, will nor, like blood in tin
animal body, circulate back again to tlie
extremities, and serve to invigorate tin
whole system, they will bseventually redu
ced to that impoverlihcd and deprefled con
dition, under which the Roman province
irroaned at the time of the Ga-fars- 1 n thi
point of view, we have not. like the coim
tries of France, England, and Holland, win
arc burthened with funding fylleins, tin
consolation of rcfleftlng, that the confla i
drafts, which are made on the distant part
to Uipply the treasury, will again return t<
those parts by means of an internal coin
merce. A variety of clrcumftances tend ii
thole countries u> produce Uiis effoft, whicl
do not ex.il! in tlie United States(lie du<
proportion between the metropolis ami the
country, which bears some analogy to th
heart and body of an animal, the compa,
fltoxttoir *>f'i*<Wc populo
tion, the good litis of their roads, the ntim
ber of their canals, and many other caule
combine together, to keep up a lively trad
between the feat of and tin
distant parts of the country, the balance o
which, owing to the iimneiUe wain â¢ oftholi
large cities alluded to, is always in favor o
the latter ; thus a circulation of money
which is as necclTary in the political body
rfpecially where a Funding iyftem cxiits, a
the circulation of the blood ill the anima
body, is constantly preserved. But whei
we stretch the imagination over that im
menfe territory which forms the Unitec
States, and perceive it in one direction pal
sing through dill'ercnt climates, and in ano
ther extending from the Atlantic, far be
yoiul that great chain of mountain:; whicl
divide into two independent parts the wholi
of the United States: when we furthe
consider, that wo have no metropolis like
London, Ainfterdam, and Paris, bearinj
any proportion to our extent of country, m
good roads or canals to facilitate an inter
lial commerce ; in lliort when we perccin
that the feat of government in the Unitec
States wherever it may be, will not, like thi
feats of government in the countries inen
tioned, De the mart of commerce and tin
receptacle for the protiuftion of the conn
try, we mull lÂ»e convinced as wan before
Anted, that the eouilant drains which th<
chief part of the United States will fuller
to support the funding (yltem, the civil lift
and the unforefeen contliigcucen, will ne
ver return to them, but will be waited ii
scenes of dissipation at the feat of govern
ment, or exported to foreign countries foi
the use of foreign ftockholdrrs.
The inevitable atid fatal consequences q>
these complicated evils will be, thai ever)
part of the union, and every individual ii
those parts, which from local circumllance
have not a commercial communication witl
the feat of government, will become mor(
and more impoverifllid, as long as the pre

United Slates, -April 1792.
Gentlemen of the House of Representa
tives,
I HAVE maturely considered the act.
passed by the two Houses, entitled, "Ar
ast for an apportionment of Representative:
among the several states, according to the
firft enumeration ;"and I return it to youi
House, wherein it originated, with the
following objections.
1. The Conflitution has prescribed, thai
representatives shall be apportioned among
the several states, according to their respec
tive numbers ; and there is no one propor
tion or divisor, which, applied to the respec
tive numbers of the states, will yield the
number and allotment of Representatives,
proposed by the bill.
2. The Conflitution has also provided,
that the numberof representatives shall
not cxceed one for every 30,000; which
rellriftion is, bj; the context, and by fair
and obvious conftruftion, to be applied
to the separate and refpeftive numbers of
the states : and the bill has allotted to eight
of the slates more than one for thirty thou
far.d. G. WASHINGTON,
Mr. W.Smith moved that the President's
objections should be entered at large on
the Journals, and to-morrow appointed
for considering them.
Mr. Sedgwick was of opinion, that the
bill is constitutionally become a law, con
sidering the number of days since it was
prefentcd.
On adivifion of the question, Mr.Smith's
motion was agreed to Adjourned.

FOR the NATIONAL GAZETTE.
On the INDIAN WAR.
(Continued from our last, and concluded)
LET us now return to the condufl of the war
asitrefpefls Congress itfelf. Last winter
Congress being fomewhai roused by the impend
ing danger after General Harmer's unfonunate
expedition, made provision for railing another
Handing regiment, and two regiments of levies
for lix months.
Thus, as in Harmer's expedition, the fhortnefi
of ihe enlistment pointed out to the enemy, the
nine to expett our army, which they availec
themselves of to greater advantage than they had
in firm la r circumflaDces the year before. II
Congress did not reflefl on the delays the recruit
ing fcrvicr must meet with from the contempti
ble lownefs of the wages, the distance of the ex
pedition, and the extent from which the recruit!
were to be collctled, as well as the accidental de
lays that so remote an expedition mult be liable
to ; I amfurc I scarce ever heard any citizens ol
intelligence conversing ori the fubieft, but what
made Tuch reflexions; and from thofc and lome
other causes for which Congress perhaps are not
refponlible, I never heard any informed person
express even a probable hope of success from last
campaign.
I know it is generally said, that when a plan
turns out unfortunate, people are then all very
difccrning in tracing its errors, but in the present
instance this foreboding doubt and anticipation
of defeat was very generally, if not universally
prevalent, and the defetts of the plan were the
topic of conversation from the firft publication
thereof. Nor is it lets generally believed, that
even in the present plan, the wages of the pri
vates though higher than last year, is so far inade
quate, that it will at last delay the execution of
any important enterprise.
That the executive being possessed of the great
est degree of information is the most accuratc
judge of military plans, is not a proper apology.
1 will admit that the executive may be allow
ed to be the best judge of the number of troops
the modes of organization &c. necessary for any
particular expedition, for u may be supposed
that in that department, the general, who is del
lined to command, has been prcvioufty consult
ed about the force with which he will rilk his
:haraÂ£ler in the execution of the plan, and gov
:rnmcnt cannot expect to be well served by a
Jeneral without granting him such force, piovi
[ions and stores, as may in his judgement be ade
quate.
Rut it is not to be supposed that a Secretary of
War, or any minifteis, are as good judges of
what amount of wages will be equal to the price
of labor, or be a fufficicnt inducement to pro
:ure the inliftment of proper persons, or whether
the time of inliftment is suited to the distance, and
probable difficulties of the marchâor of the
ilreadful consequences to the frontiers, of a de
feat at the moment the inliftment of the greatefl
part of the army was expiredâthese are fubjefcti
jpon which Congress are competent to decide,
md for the decision on which .hey are only con
llitutionally relponfible. It is to be regretted
that when legislating on this fubjetl Congress
keep their doors shutâl admit that the commu
nications made by the Prcfident in confidence
Should be kept secret, but that the wages of fol
iiers, the time for which they are eniifted, &c.
.vhichare designed to be published at the drum
read by every reciuiting sergeant, should be
<ept a secret when fettling thele things in the
Houfeof Representatives, is a littleextraordii.ary;
.vhy are members afraid that their conilituenls
fiould know how they vote on these questionsâ
Perhaps there are few fubje&s come before the
egiflature which the people understand better,
ind refpffting which they are more interefled.
f the House only gave the fan&ion of law to the
Secretary's report, the doors need not be (hut, â
f the business is originated and freely difcufled
n the House, the doors ought not to be shut.
The Prtfident of the United States has a con
litutional right to inform Congrels of the state of
he union, and to recommend such business as
le thinks expedient, and it is the duty of Con
gress to receive the information ; and give a due
:onfideration to the business which he recom
nends, but Congress has alio the command of
'very other source of information, indeed if the
House of Representatives is an equal and fuffici
â ntly numerous reprefemation, the best source of
nformation is within itfelf, but ccitarnly Con
trols aie not obliged to do the business that
omes before them in the manner the President
nay dircft, much lels are they obliged, to adopt
neafures reported by a Secretary to the Pfi si
lent, for which the mitiiftcrial charatler only is
cfponfible.
Relponfibility seems to be the idol of the times;
tis fometitnes spoken of as the perfect lecurity
jgainff every political ill. A small House of Re
presentatives has been argued for, that it might
have the more responsibility, and a single execu
tive has become generally considered as the best
even for republican governments, because it ha;
more rcfponfibility ; but if the practice is intro
duced of the Representatives of the people tranf
feriing their rcfponfibility, to the executive, the
executive may to a minister, and the minifler tc
some influential favoriteâwhere will then the
boafled security arising from rcfponfibility be i J J
aril led into this tiain of thinking by observing,
that when I, as otheis, asked members ofCongrcf:
why the wages was so low, the inliflments ft
short &c. we were conflantly told that the Secre
tary reported it so, and that if Congress had mad<
alterations in the plan, it would have deftroyee
the miniiter's responsibilityâwill that refpormbi
litvreflore to their families and friends our son:
and brethren whose mangled remains -have in twi
iu*fi ffive campaigns in the dittant wilderoels e
relied monuments of our folly and disgrace mor<
durable than buds of marble, 01 reimbuife for th(
distress and carnage of our frontier fcttlersân<
itwillnot. If the representatives of the peopli
will indulge themselves in indolence and inatten
lion, and depend upon ministers to plan thei
buGnefs, they are not to be furpriled if the peo
pie should soon begin 10 look upon them wit!
difgul), and change, a government which thougl
it polfefsthe forms, dots not exercise the habit
peculiar to a republic. SIDNEY.
To the Editor of the National Gazette.
Mr. Fkeneau,
YOUR correlpondent PLAIN SENSE i
so positive and dogmatical in his de
fence of that Representation Fill, whicl
has iince been condemned to death by thf
united voices of the President of the Unit
ed States, and a refpeitable majority of the
House of Representatives, that I am almof
afraid to offer a word in opposition to him
further than to suggest, with all due defer
ence, that his flatement is totally falfe, un
constitutional, and only calculated to en
snare and deceive the unwary. The confti
tution expressly declarer, that the represent
able numbers of the feveralltates "Jhal
be determined, by adding to the whole number of/re
terfons (including those bounel to service foi
a term of years, and excluding Indians noi
taxed) threeffths of all other perj'ovs : â" bu!
he boldly excludes tliofe three fifths fron
all share of representation, without evei
condescending to tell us why. Kis eloc
trine might well suit the interefl: of the five
[or, as they soon will be, fix] N. Englant
uates, which do not, all together, coiltair
half so many pcrfous of this class, a:

Measures with the Emperor.
M. Benguot resumed the debate. He
considered the explanation to be demanded
of the Emperor, ar.d the treaty of 1 56, as
tliflinft things ; supported the proportion
of the Diplomatic Committee, and propo
ftd to fix a day for debating the treaty.
M. Foucher said, a free people co;;'d
only contrast alliances with free men.
All treaties with defpdts were void. The
English, the Americans, the Dutch, the
Poles, were the only people with whom
regenerated France could from alliance.
While the people of other Hates were
peaceable and friendly, let them be treated
like good natural savages; if they were
otherwifs, so much the worse for them.
Let France declare, that such ffates as
chose to live under despots, or aristocrats,
had nothing to dread from her ; that
when they chose to become free, rhey
should be her allies ; and that she would
take the towns of those who protected the
emigrants on her frontiers, and keep them
till the expences of the war were paid.
He proposed also to recal all Consuls
and AmbafTadors as useless, and to fignify
once a year to all free fiates, that France
persisted in her friendly sentiments to
wards them.
M. Bequet supported the propositions
of the committee.
M. Ifnard recounted the numerous in
fraffions of treaty by the emperor, "Let
us halten to shew ourselves formidable to
him. He Hands in need of our alliance,
and will not facrifice it to the pleasure of
deflroying our liberty. Let us carry the
war into his territories. The people of
the Low Countries, of Lieg? and of Hol
land. will unite with us. Let us cut out
work for tyrants; but let us not wait for
them. War in our own country would
be horrible. Let not our King, so inter
effed in our glory, shew weakness in this
war. The nation has forgiven fault :, but
will fotgtvc no more. Every traitor shall
perish by our hands. King , Mini iters,
and Generals, take notice ! the dye is
caff. We will enjoy the laws of equality,
if it be but in the grave. The blood of
every traitor should flow,if our own should
be mixed with it."â-The debate was again

STRICTURES
On Patent Syjitms for promoting the progress of tit
ufeful Arti.
ON reading the piece published in this citj
from the Delaware Gazette, [fee Nationa
Gazette of March 22] refoe&ing the great im
provement made in the manufactory of flour, bj
the machinery invented by Mr. Oliver Evans, anc
theeftimated saving of four hundred thousand dol
lars annually, on the supposed number of twi
thousand mills in the United States, the mind is
naturally led to consider the enlightened policy o;
those governments, which have, by a well regula
ted patent fyitem, (limulated ingenious men, whe
Ire frequently found in the more humble walks ol
life, at the expence of their labour, time, and pro
perty, to perfect their inventions in a great varietj
of ufeful arts, which, without such stimulus, would
probably never have been produced to the world.
The altonifhing degree of perfection, to which th<
arts are now carried in England, is owing, in s
great measure, Co a well regulated patent fyltem 5
In proof of this, it will be fufficient to produce on
ly two instances, the firft is, that of MefTrs. Bol
ton and Watt's improvement in the (team enginej
the patent term of fourteen years therein, when
neÂ«rly expired, was extended to James Watt, bj
aCt of parliament, to the further term of twenty
live years : The other is, the parent obtained b)
Sir Richard Arkwright, for his machine for spin
ning cotton.
If the number of people, in a great variety o;
arts, which find employment by these inventions;
particularly the firft, could be ascertained, it woulc
be incredible : It is fufficient to remark, thatthej
have encreafed (he manufactories, and, of course
the exports of that country, to an astonishing a
mount.
There is no part of the world, where the intro
dudtion of new and ufeful inventions in the arts
would be more extensively beneficial, than in thi
United States, owing to the high price of labour
the enterprising spirit of the people, and the grea
abundance of raw materials, that the encreafinj
agriculture of the country will supply. And per
haps there no where exists, amongst a free or en
lightened people, a more impeifeCt system, thai
that eftabliihed by the aCt of Congress, for promo
ting the progress of the ufeful arts j firft, as undei
this law, patents would iflue to twenty differen
people, applying at the fame time, for exclufiv<
grants in the fame thing, there being no mode pre
scribed for trying the merits of such applications :
And, even if all those patents, purporting to b<
prima facie evidence, that each patentee was th<
original inventor of the thing in question, should
fceverthelefs, be surreptitiously obtained for anj
machine, or device, in commcn use, or anothe;
person's invention, there is no provision made b]
law, nor any clause in the patents, making tlierr
voidable, as in England, by the common law. I
is true, the exclusive privileges, granted by such
patents, or any others that have yet been obtained
are not secured by any other penalty, than wha
might be given by a jury, frequently interested ir
vacating those grants ' y and in cafe of a v'iolatior
of the patent principles, no provision is made thai
the patentees ihould commence their suits in thi
federal courts, unless the damages be prefume<
equal to five hundred dollars, and, as the damages
in any one instance, can seldom be laid in the fun
of five hundred dollars, of course, the (late court
only have original jurisdiCtion in those cases, al
though the subjeCt of a dispute will generally a
rife on the construction of an aCt of Congress, tli
supreme law of the land. For these and fom
other reasons which begin to unfold themselves
the present system will soon be found to be mucl
worse th3n none, and far inferior to that adopte<
by several of the states, before the union ; am
from thole defeCts, several patents now remain ii
the otTice, and many inventions, which promif
great public utility, are withheld, in expeCtatioi
that a more perfeCt fyftrm would soon be efta
bliihed. For which purpose, a bill was reportei
to Congress at their last fefiions, but no order ta
ken thereon j the fame business was committer
very early in the present fellions, and after a lapfi
of more than four months, a bill was reported
which has not yet been taken up by the House
It might, therefore, be improper, at this time, t<
point out any of the defeCts of this bill, or to pro
pose such amendments as would secure the right
of individuals in their respeCtive inventions, am
eflentially promote the interests of the public. I
may be necefTary, however, here to add, that it ha
been alledged, that the present very imperfeCt pa
tentfyftem was occasioned, not so much from a wan
of information on the subjeCt, as from an ide;
that all exclusive grants in a man's inventions
however beneficial to the public, were either mo
nopolies, or an encroachment on the rights of o
thers. How far this sentiment may retard th
progress of the bill now before the House, or ftamÂ»|
the features of it, when it shall have parted tin
Senate and House of Representatives, is uncertain
There can be no doubt, however, but a man ha
Â» perfeCt right to his inventions in any art, as ex
ifling in his own ideas previous to any patent ; ye
a well founded expectation of having this righ
secured for a limited time by legal sanCtions, ma
itimulate him, by unremitted exertions, to a vari
ety of expensive experiments, and frequently b
the funds of others thus interested therein, to pro
duce it to the world j when, without any expenc
to the public, his emoluments will be in propor
tion to the merits of the invention, which become
public property after the expiration of the paten
term ; and this term, if not extended beyond th
period of fourteen years, will scarce allow time
either fully to perfeCt, or to bring into general use
some of the most ufeful improvements ; efpeciall
in a country where artists are yet to be inftruCte<
in a great variety of branches, with which such in
vention9 may be connected.

ragraphs,]
LONDON, Jan. 31â Feb. 10.
The public of England know very little of the
state of France, but what they are told by the
partizans of power, or by the French emigrants,
two-thirds of whom, pretending to fly from per
secution, are really fugitives for debt, and come
to England to be protected against their creditors,
as they used to be in France. The reft of them,
having loft their places and pensions, are extreme
ly sorry for it, and would be glad to recover them,
no matter by what means, even tho* it inlurea
their own deftruttion.
A number of Imperial ships have been takrn
up at Oftend, by agents of the Engliih East-In
dia Company, to bring sugar from India next
season.One city alderman, only, has engaged two
thousand tons for this bufinefs.âln consequence
of such steps, Weft-India sugar mult soon fall,
unless the illand Haves should revolt.
According to all the latest accounts both from
France and Germany, the proportions and the
menaces of the leaders of the French emigrants
have been repelled with equal disdain by the na
tional afiembly. They are now obliged to dif
perle, and their deluded followers left to lament
the deceitful hopes by which they were induced
to abandon their country. Unwise is that party
in any nation, that prefers dependence on fo
reign powers, to yielding to the majority at home.
The refufal of government to grant the politi
cal privileges petitioned for by the Roman Catho
lics in Ireland, hay greatly increased their num
ber, and inflamed their earnestness for a complete
participation of lights with the Protestants. Thus,
an attempt to oppose a j*ft and reasonable de
mand is only found to give it additional force.
One (hip has failed, and another is fitting ou
from Bristol for the new fettl-ment of Sierra Le
ona, on the coa'l of Africa. They are laden witl
aH kinds of implements for building, and witl
tools for carpent-'rs, joiners, blacksmiths, an<
other trades, as well as with instruments for cul
tivating the ground, which is represented as re
markable fertile. In each ship there are acconv
nidations for 40 or 50 artificers and husbandmen
who are going to fettle in that country under th<
protection of the Sierra Leona company. It i:
supposed, that by the beginning of the enfuinj
year, the company will have two thousand acre
planted with sugar canes. The natives of th<
country are to be engaged to work for hire, ani
to the people who go out from home, trails o
land are to be afiigned. Every man is to have2C
acres j if he has a wife, he is to have ten more,
and for each child an addition of five acres.
The emigrant princes have puloliftied a mani

Extratf of a letter from Bruges, Jan, 14.
il From the steps at present caking in Austrian
Flanders and in Brabant, it faems clear, that if
Leopold had not taken trie most" vigorous precau
tions against rhe feeds and the firft appearance of
tebellion, those two provinces would by this time
have become a prey to new troubles. The air
itfelf fecms to be infedted with f.he spirit of in
furre&ion, and no other than French principles
are adopted. If the njw constitution of France
had not annihilated the nobility, to which the
Flemings and Brabanters still adhere j if it had
not attacked the dogmas of the Catholic religion,
to which they are ardently and zealorjfly devoted,
there is reason to think that the yoke of the
House of Austria would have been shaken off for
the second time more than fix months ago, or
chat the richest of the inhabitants would have
j carried into France their fortunes and their in
duftry. To these two articles Is to be added a
third, viz. they consider the. constitution as An
gularly defective, in many of its parts. Never
theless, no done is unturned to bring about an
explosion among them. âAbout a week ago,
some publications were circulated here, known to
have been printed in France, exciting them to
revolt, to quit the dominion of a prince who, ii
is said, has broke his word to them 5 with a pro
mile, that France will support them, particularl
if *they chufe chiefs worthy of edeem and confi
dence : for, it is added, the French themfelve;
have had, and dill continue to have, cause to
repent the choice they have in some indancet
made, and to lament their having been betrayed
by their agents on more than one important oc
casion ; all this announces new scenes of revolu
tion, and portends that Europe is not likely to
enjoy tranquility. 1 *
Extratf of a letttr from the Hague, Jan. 6.
The States-General have sent to the State:
of the provinces, the answer of the court of Lon
don to the notification of the plan of an alliance
between the court of Vienna and our republic.
They are desirous of having the opinion of all the
provinces upon the said vague answer, before they
take any condufive dep. It is thought this le
quefted opinion will not be long waited for j an
that the answer of the court of Berlin having been
clear, positive, an J approving, no delay.will be oc
cafioned by the drained and equivocal answer 0
the English miniflry. This answer has not ye
been made public $ it is, however, considered a;
having been dictated by a kind ofjealoufy, whofr
objedt, if not to frudrate, appears at lead to pro
tract the negociations begun. The Cabinet o
St. James's made no ceremony of faying, that ii
was unable to give a categorical answer te'cre i
had consulted the Court of Berlin upon the Tub
jedt; It has explicitly dated, that the conventioi
made at the Hague in 1790, relative to the Aul
trian Low Countries, Ihould remain inviolate,
whatever modifications his Imperial Majefly ma
have thought proper to make in the ratification.
This inconteftibly dilclofes views rather unfavor
able to the dellgn. It is however thought, tha
when explanations take place with his Pruffiar
Majedv, who is for it, his Britannic Majesty wil
soon cease to be againd it.
