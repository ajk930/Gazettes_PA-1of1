key. which Montesquieu fuppoTcs more

of power is lighter than here, but heavier
than with us, they happen every half do

order, the moderation, and the almofl fell
extinguidinient of ours. After all, it is
my principle that'th.- viill of the majority
should always prevail. If,they approve the
proposed convention in all its part's, I fball
concur in it fihecrfully, in hopes that they
y wil! â¢ mend it Whenever they fliall find it

will remain virtuous for many centuries i
as long as they are chicfly agricultural;
and tni s will be as long as theie fball be
vacant lands in any part of America.
When th.y get piled upon one another in
large cities, as in Europe, they will become
rorrupt ar. in Europe, Above all tilings
I hope the education of the common peo
ple will be attended to ; convinced that on
their good sense we may rely with the
moll f curity for the prcferv .tion of a due

A caTjidState of PARTIES.
AS it is the business of the contemplative
ftateftnan to trace the history of par
ties in a free country, so it is the duty of
the citizen at all tinies to understand the
i'.itual state of them. Whenever this duty
is omitted, an opportunity is given to de
signing men, by theufe of artificial ornomi
lial .to oppose and balance a
g.iinft cach other thdfe who never differed
as to the end to be pnrfued, and may no
longer differ as to the means of attaining it.
The most interesting state of parties in the ,
United States may be referred to three peri- â 
ods : Thsfe who espoused the cause of inde
pendence and those who adhered to the Bri- i
tifh claims, formed the parties of the firft
period ; if, indeed, the difaffefted class were ,
coni'idarao'e enough to deserve the name of t
a party. Thijftatr of things wasfuperfed- ,
cd by the treaty of peace in 1783. From t
to 1-8: there were parties in abnn- 7
d. nee , but being rather local than general, t
tiiev are not within the present review. ,
The Federal Conftitlitioil, proposed in ,
the atteryear, gave birth to a fecund and ;
molt, interesting divilion of the people J
Every one remembers it, because every one j
\va involved in it.
Among those who embraced the conftittl- c
tion. the great body were unquestionably
friends to republican liberty ; tho' there â
were, 110 doubt, fbme who were openly or
fecreily iutaclied tojno larchy and arifto- t
cracy; and hoped tojjiake the constitution a s
Cradie for theie hei\tma."_v .eftabl ilunents. a
Among those <\ liooppofed the conftitu- a
tion, the :,reat. b'Jiiy were certainly well as- t
felted to the tinio'i a:id to f good government, {
tho' there might be a few who had a leaning f
tmfavourable to both. This state of par- n
ties waj termi'iated bv the regular and ef- r
fectual eftabiifhinenti of the federal go- j
veriiment in 1788 ; out of'the administration ),
of \\ h ch. however, has arisen a third divili- b
on. which be'ug' natural to ni'oft political v
societies, is likely to be of some duration in t
ours.
One of the divisions corifiits of tho'e, who (j
from particular i.Uereit, from natural tem- ( |
per, or from the habits of life, are more n
partial to the opulent than to the other claf- b
fes offociety; aud having debauched them- it
felvesmto a periuafipn that mankind are v
incapable of governing themselves, it sol- C(
loWs with them, of course, that govern- c ,
ment can be carried on only by the pagean- C ;
try of rank, the influence of money and e- ni
moiuments, and the terror of military \
force. .Men of those sentiments must na- m
turatly wish topoint the measures of go- ;l i
vernmeut less to the interest of the many ft
than of a few, and less to the reason of the fa
many than to their Weaknt*fles; hoping per-
liaps iii proportion to the ardor of their zeal, th
that by giving such a turn to the admini- iâ
ftrauo.i, the government itfelf may by de- bi
grees be 11a rowedm o fewer haiids, and ap
proximated to an hereditary form.
Tne other divilion connfts of those who â
belie-viug in the doarine that mankind are tf
capa'de ofgover.ling themselves, and hating f r
hereditary pov\er as an insult to the realon n Â«
iiud an outrage to the rights of man, are ai
f- naturally offended at tvery public measUre
[ S that does not appeal to the underftandiilg
and to the general interest of the commu
nity, or that is Hot strictly conformable to
â the principles, and conducive to the prefer-
I vation of republican government.
II I his being the real state of parties among
e us,an experienced aud difpallionate observer
will be at no loss.to decide on the probable
;s conduct of each.
I'he anti republican party, as it may be
u called, bei.ig the weaker in point of num
bers, will be induced by the most obvious
' motives to strengthen themselves with tke
"S men of influence particularly of moneyed,
a wfrich is the most active and insinuating in
fluence. It will be equally their true poli
e cy to weaken their opponents by reviving
exploded parties, and taking advantage of
all prejudices, local, political, and occupa
tional, that may prevent or disturb a gener
" afl coalition of l'en iments.
'- t lie Republican party, as it may be
s termed, conscious that tlje mafi of people in
e ev/?ry pSrt Of the union, v.i every ifete, and
of every occupation must at bottom be with
them, ' orh in interest 2'id sentiment) will'
naturally find their account in burying all
y antecedent questions, in banifliing every
t other diftinciion than that between enemies
1 and friends to republican government, and
s iÂ» promoting a general harmony among the
t latter, wheiever residing, or however crti
s
Whether the republican.or the rival par
â¢ iv will ultimately eflablilh its sfcendance, is
i a problem which may be contemplated now;
i but which time alone can solve. On one
. hand experience thews that in politics as in
, war, ftraiigeni is often an overmatch for
, numbers : and among more hippy charac
erillics of oili' political ficuatfdtl, kis now
well understood that there arepeculiaritie.s,
fame temporary, others more durable,
' wliich may favoui" that fide in the contest.
: On the republican fide, again, the fuperio
; rity of numbers is so great, their feutiments
are so decided, and the practice of making a
common eaufe, where there is a common
IVntiment aud common interest, in fpight of
circumftancial and artificial distinctions, is
lo well understood, that no temperate ob
server or human aifairs will be surprised if
die issue in the present inftaiice fliould be
reverted, and the government be admirii
ftered in the spirit and form approved by
the great body of the people.

maturing agriculture ; and this not so
much with a view to the immediate advan
tage of agriculture, as to the folic! and ulti
mate prcfperity of manufactures. The fol
lowing reasons, it Is conceived, must over- ;
come the most obstinate prejudices in this 1
cafe. '
lirft, all wi iters and all experience a
gree, that population is more rapid in the J
country among tillers of (he earth, than in
town , the chief abode of manufacturers '
Secondly, that an abundant population can
alone support a flourifhing state, either of â¢
agriculture or of manufacturesâThirdly, '
that hands for manufacture; are to be drawn Â°
from that surplus of labourers which is ?
found on the foilâFourthly, to uurfe and,
multiply labourers of the foil, is, therefore, C
the true and obvious means of providing '
the ha ids wanted tor manufacturesâFifth - ''
ly, clieapnefs of food and of materials ;
both of which are the fruit of the foil, the
very life and foul of manufactures ; and r
this cheapness will be promoted by filling
up the vacant country with labourers, and V
Stimulating by bounties their skill and in- L
duftryâSixthly, as population is the great 3
reservoir from which manufacturers are to â
be derived, fa immigration is one of the P
itreams that may help to fill up the refer- Â°
voir. Now, in every just view, it is better f:
to invite foreigners from the country nla
ces, than from the towns of Europe be- g
cause they will bring with them equal, if "
no: more, industry, and certainly lets vice
And as to manufactures, they must gain as "
much from the introduction of tillers as of ?
art.z ms ; since the former by iilcrealing the U
flock of hands on the foil, will enable it the "
Taller to supply hands for niariufartures ; f
and, by tncrcafing the quantity and keepin, down '
the puce cf provjicn and materials, will give
immediate nonnlhment to that valuable 8
branch -of indufiry.
It will be asked, perhaps, where will be r
thejuftice, where the refpeit for the rights r ,
of property, where the equal protection to r ;
the tree choice of our occupations and the
tree ule of our faculties, thus to take mo- ~,
ney from the pocket of the manufacturer ,i
and give it to tile farmer ?
â "â¢ L~-
6 ] i-J'" S 5 Uf ft' lon wotoM be attended with its
ig' difficulties, were it net for two confidera
i- t'ons : tlie one, that our opponents must
0 hrlt answer it by fhew.ng the
i- iuftice of taking the money of the farmer,
mil giving it to the hiantofaSHrerthe o-'
'& ther, that this is not a question of jttftice,
" hut of mere policy, and being tliraiHed in
le thatligiitonly.it is impertinent-to view it
111 any other.
>e Should this answer not be fatisfaflory, i
a- and the justice, right, and equally of the
is meafnre still be inlifted on as no less indif
ie penfable than its policy, I will endeavour
1. to avoid the difficulty by another theory,
i- derived not (o much from my own princi
i- pies or contrivance, as from the ingenuity
! g of a friend who has been To kind as to cbm
Â» municate it tp me.
This theory proposes, that instead of
1 taxing agriculture in favotir of manufac
tures, or manufactures in behalf of agri
* culture, all profefiions, trades, occupations,
" ahd employments whatsoever fliall be re
(l cjprocally "taxed and reciprocally bountled
h by a comprehenlive proVlfion of the govern
j nient for that ptirpofe. Thus let the ma
ll nufachirer be taxed, and the ta* paid as a
y bounty to the farmer; aiSd the account be
"j balanced by a tax levied on the farmer,
d and paid back as a bounty to the manufac
e turer. So again, a bounty may be taxed on
- the maker of hemp and given to the maker
of cotton, aud a like bounty in turn be le
- vied on the maker of cotton 'an*d bellowed
S oil the maker of hemp. Or; in a more cir
; cul-ar way, by taxes Ikitfully adjusted, the
e maker of hemp, cotton or wheat, after re
ii reiving a bounty drawn from some other
i" occupation, may pay a bqimty to the gra
zier, he to the tanner, he to the /hoemaker,
i' lie to the ruddier, he to the Coach-maker,'
, he to the Ironmonger, he to the imith, he
, to the stocking weaver, he to the cotton
manufa&urer, &c. &c. quite round tti the
- point from which you set out. Iti this
s luauher every body will receive bounties,
i It will be a lottery where every ticket will
i draw a prize, and every adventurer cOllfe
t quently be pleafefl.
s To the ob'eftifch, that the prizes recei
â  ved by the whole society cannot exceed the
r sums paid by the whole, and that as great
deductions mint be made in the bargain for
tile expence of managing the scheme, every
class ot citizens instead of being gainers,
rtutft.in f a a be lieceflarily losers; to this
objection, I ray, my friend who is as dex
trous in defending as he Is ingenious in
forming his thoughts, has a double reply
i eady, jo those who contend ior any o
:her form of premiums and bounties, he '
repeats what has been already said ; that 1
as they must either fall into evident parti- '
ahty and injustice, or proceed in the I'ame
magical circle, they have no right to start '
the objeaion. To thole, not under this !
, embarrafinietlt, he remarks,, that in all lot
teries and like schemes, where prizes and 1
premiums are to be obtained, the fund for !
paving them must be taxed on the adven-
turers, and particularly, that rile deduc
I nous and drawbacks not only make a part 1
of the scheme, but constitute its very ef- 1
fence; the scheme being set on foot for the ,
lake not of those who are to (hare the pi i- 1
zes and premiums, but of those who are to 1
have the benefit of the drawbacks and pro- c
nts. rhe former is quite a recondary, col- f
lateral, and incidental matter, well enough c
to amuse the calculations and hopes of the I
adventurers, but by no means the direst f
or primary object of the projectors. Con- I 1
lidered in this point of view, every is I 1
smooth and square i for note (fayshe) the
curious and charming efl'eas of a universal c
system of bounties, fiipported by a fyftcm r
of taxes well digested and disguised for such h
an application.
Kn it, having tile appearance of equality, 1
it silences, or, at least, roftens the noisy d'e- t;
claimers against unequal principles of le- c
giflation. Secondly, it will diffu/e good "
humour among all the fiiperficial and in- 1
considerate part of the community, who
receiving the bountv immediately and pal- n
pably, and paying the tax, they know not 11
when and feel not how, forget that the n
bounty is taken out of their own pockets, r f
and are ready to imagine it the produa of *1
some fle.ght-of-hand in the government be- P
yond their comprehension, or not worth u
their enquiry. Thirdly, the deductions Â°
and drawbacks in such a cafe may' fairly be *
estimated at io or ij per cent, on the Him Zl
paid by the people, the whole of which be- 0
conies a fund for salaries and to 0
Ooileflors, receivers, treasurers, commir- Â°
honers, managers, &c. &c. enabling the tc
government to reward a greater number
ot its p.aive friends, and' encrealing its
means of obtaining a willing obedience to vl
all its measures, or of compelling obedi- P'
ence where its measures may produce an 111
unwillingness. Fourthly, of no less value Â®
is the advantage that must accrue to the 10
government from a proper dijptn fatten of the ra
bounties. No better opportunity can be 1,1
conceived for rewarding political merit of g c
all forts, for exte .ding the salutary influ
ence of power in every direaion ; and for m
throwing a decent veil over the jobs and 1,1
schemes in which the membets of all well fÂ°
regulated governments have the immemo
rial privilege of sharing; but which in our PÂ°
new-fangled republic, and in these cenfori- or
ous times, it will be prudent to hide from fci
the public eye. Fifthly, the last advantage fÂ«
to be noticed, out of the infipitp that it i
its mains, is the solid ground it affords to the
11- government for enlarging its whole system
id: of taxation ; for nothing can be more just
he and reafonoble, or which is the fame thing,
;r, can be more fpeciotidy" lo called, than that
0- the government should reap where it has
e, (own; thar.it {hould gather fruit from the
in tiee it has planted; or, to (peak plainly
it and without a metaphor, that it dionld ex
cifl? every article as tad as its bounties have
y, brought it to fufficient maturity for the o
ie peration.
f- Agaiilft this reasoning one objection only
ur is forefeen by an ingenious theorist, to wit,
y, that the whole of the advantages content--
1- plated are to fall to the government -
ty whereas, the interefl: of the people is the
true object for which every public meafnre
blight to be calculated. But this he treats,
of with the greatest levity, as a pitiful qnib
c.~ He . inlifts .t?iat the diltinaion is fan
s' ciful and inadtniffible, and appeals with the
s, utmolt confidence tb various numbers of the

1 Mr. FRENEAU,
IF Andidcs merits Odracifm for tis clumsy
? of Mr. Jeffeifon, what species of pun
t ifnment does an anonymous danderer merit,
who publicly avows his own wickedness ? It
. was not enough for Secure, j n Mr. Fenno's lad
t Gazette, evincing his enmity to Mr. Jefferfon,
. to detract fiom the endeavours of his friends,
but he mud exultingly add in the fame sentence,
I that be would in this "verify the injlance in
â¢ Mr, JefferJcn had 10/ l more iy the Jolly of his
friends than by the tvickednejs of his enemies," I ' ââ¢
Such a public avowal of wickedness on the part
. of the Junto was little to be cxptfled, but as
coming fipm one of themfclves, and compared
wiib the tenor of their united exertions to ca
lumniate Mr. Jefferfon, the public, it is prefu
mcd will be well dilpofed to give it their full
credence. 7 here is another trait in the last
publication "which didinguifhesitfrom the others,
descending from die dignity ot a public accuser
and didaiisfied with the causes of dander heieto
foi e exhibited, this writer disgorges the full ve
nom of his malice in one furious essay of ca
lumny and detraaion, foinetimes ludicrous,
lonietimes serious, but always complaining or
condemning, he pursues Mr. jefferfon thto'eve
ry circtimflahce of his public life, and condemns
hÂ»m alike in France or in America as the ma
lign diliurberof ihe rcpofe of both heroifpheres.
Ihe attempt to ridicule the philosophy and
talents of Mr. Jefferfon reminds us of the puny
iffoits of a witling boy to excite mirth, which
not being fufficient to piovoke our risibility,
cjiules no other emotion than that of contempt
and pity. But the enlightened citizens of A
merica will not readily a'ffent to the idea, that
ihat man isan enemy to the r ;hts of human
nature, or to the union & p- ofpe ltvof his coun
ttv, v.liofe public afls and wntings have already
didingtiifhed him as the great mover, and cham

ol_ toleration and univerlal freedom in the rights
or con.cience cnafled into law in \ lrginia, and
to which Ihe national assembly of France
and mod ofthe philosophers in Europe have paid
their tribute of applause ; and, finally, whose
virtues and talents Ihll retain to hiin the unim

jeflured the Fnglifh court had a design up
on the iflrs of France and Bourbon in the
Indian ocean, as intermediate harbours for
their Hipping, and the pofTeflTon of which
would greatly contribute to the preserva
tion ef tliijir acqui fit ions in ludia.
It does sot appear from the proceedings
of the national' aflembly, that the deth'rb'ning
the king of F: aiice was an object seriously
contemplated in rhe councils of the nation.
I nat am' several other violent proportions
of a finvlar nature were, indeed, made,
but dif approved of by the cooler part of the
aflembly, a projecE pregnant with danger
to the real intere'Vsof France.

Late accounts from Europe inform that

the purpose of invading Hungary. The

One of the most remarkable chara<Venr
tics of the French revolution is the facility
witll which any of their national projects aii
begun and ended. The proceedings on the
20th of June are an instance ; the very re
cital of which is fuificient to make the fub
jeÂ£b of another power tremble. N'otwith-
Itanding that terrible cene, however, Pari*
is again quiet, and every rhiirgfeetm to be
reluming its naturai Girder. The influence
of national character is, nodoubr, the pr;n
cipal cause. Be it remembered, however,
that the criminal excelits of fnch men as
Pethton, Mertin, Saiiterre, and Si.
ought not to escape unpunished, altho' ihe
extreme malignity of their defigus has de
feated i own purpose. Ity'd Gaz.j

of the German tyrants âThe account of

London paper's, that the American mini Her
at Paris used his endeavours that the fune

as afterwards decided by the national as
sembly. It is added.that every man of public
note accepted the invitation to the funeral
of Jones, as one of the champion" of Ame

ADDRESS
To the People of Ireland, by Mr. Sinclair 01
tbe Fourteenth of Julj lastÂ»
u TT7"E, the volunteers and other inhabitants
â VV of the town and neighbourhood oi
Belf-aft, aifembled to Commemorate ibis great day
embrace with earneftnels this opportunity whicr
it aflords, at once to express our zeal and aiTeftior
lor the cause of liberty in France, and our undif
guiled opinions on fubjs&s of the last importance
to 0 jr native land.
" Trained from our infancy in a love of free
dom, and an abhorrence of tyranny, we congra
tulate our brethren of France, and ourselves, that
the Infamous cor Ipi racy of Haves and defpors,
aga'rtft the happineft and glory of that admired
and refpe&eu nation, and againlt the common
Right of Man, has hitherto proved abortive.
tc fixing our view fteftdily on the great princi
ple <lf Gallic emancipation, we will not be divert
ed from that magnificent objett by the accident
al tumults oi momentary ebullitions of popular fu
ry. < We will not estimate the wisdom of her le
gislators by the traufports of a mob j nor the spi
rit bf hef armies by the cowardice of a jegiment ]
nor the patriotism of the people by the treachery
of individuals j nor the julVice of her cause by the
numSer of her en/mies. W? judge with othej
views and on other principlesâwe fee, with ad
miration, France extending the land-marks o!
human knowledge in she great art 0# gove rnmcnt,
and operiirig to the world new (yftenu of policy and
ofjxiftice. We fee her renounce all wars on the
principle of conquest. We fee her propole an
universal brotherhood ind an eternal peace among
the natioris. V/e fee her even now, when forced
into arms andbloodlhed by theUnjuft and unprin<
cipled machinations of her en.mies, feparatinjr,
a3 far as poHibie, the innocent fu;bj*-& from tlif
guilty despot j refpe&ing amidll the horrors of
wai, the pcoperty of individuals j and exempting
fropi interruption the peaceful iratho of (he mer
chant, lc is from vievys ke theie that we rtti
mate that ftjpendous event, the Revolution,
which we this day commemorate j not fiom ac
cidental irregularities, which, while we condemn
them, we are compelled to f>'ty, as feeling that
thev Ipring not merely from a fpirlt of licentiouf
jiefs, bat from a sense of injury working on a san
guine people, ftiil galled with the recolle&ion ol
recent tyranny andmpprefiaoh, and jealous of lib
erty, J)u v c juit recovered, and lcartely \et secure.
Such are our fenument& on the lubjedl ol
the FreJch revolution s we come now to the '-tale
of our own country,
il ImpfefTed as w; arc with a deep sense of the
excel.ence *rou+ conftituti >n, as it exists in theo
ry; we 1 j >:*e tim we are not, -like our brethren
in Franly, redoctd lo the hard oecelTity cf tearing
ud invert rate al?ufe by the roots, even where util
ity Vo;inteimixed as not to admit of fe t)ara
tion. Ours is an eafler and a less unpleafitfg
task ;to reitjo c with a steady and a terrtperate
rciolucion the abuses which the lapse of many
years irhrtention and" fupin-enefs in a great body
of the people,-Â«wd inwcmit f, ii" vigUance in cheii
rulers t- ' ' 'id Lhein oi their rights,
hav _ tp'yvefgr w and to defoi m that bean
t'.Â«ui ly.item of government, Co'admirably fuiteu tii
our fitt ation, our fiabjta, and our wishes. We
have nor to i/jriovatb but to refh<re. The jolt
prerogative of our monarch we N and Wil,
maintain.*âThe power of the peen
We with not't'o invade- We know â  that in the
exercile of both, abufrs have grown up. j but w<
also know that thofc abuses vArill at once be, cor
rei\ed, so as neve'r again to recur, by refloring tt
us, the people, what we, Tor ourfrl ves_, demand a 1
our righ?, or due weight and influence in that es
tate, which is our property, the leprefentation cl
. the people in pari ament.
. ii Thoioughly impief|ed with the unjust anc
fulnous inequality of that repjefentation, with t
consequent corruption which pervades all ranks ii:
the Hate 5 with che deftruftion of the morals, tin
facrifice of the'Commercej and the hourly immi
nent danger to the libeity'ot our country, we will
)nflex-ibl> perlevere in th,q pursuit of that greai
remedy for all our political evils a parliamentarj
reform ; a refbrrt> temperate, equal and ju(t
which lhall restore lustre to the crown, dignity to
the peerage, and their due weight and influence ti
the people of Ireland.
" But while we thus stats our sentiments on
the tubjea of teform.we feel it incumbent on u;
to declare, as we do now, that no reform, werr
even such attainable, would answer our idtai cl
utility or jullice, which ihomd not equally include
all fcfts and denominations ol lfiftimen. We re
probatcand abhdr the idea,that political inequali.
flusuld tefult from opinions | and ws
ifipuld be afliamed, at the moment we are reeking
Tor liberty ourlelves, to acquTfcfce. in any iyftem
founded on the llavery of others.
" We have now declared our sentiments to the
.vorjd. In declaring them we spurn, with equa.
iifjain, restraint whether proceeding from a mob
Â»r a monarch j from a riot or a proclamation.
*Ve look with a mixture of abomination and con-
on the transitions which, on the last an
ivcrfary of the French Revolution, degraded the
national character of England } when neither the
.earning, the piety, the public spirit, nor the pri
vate virrue of a Ijr1 j r 1 estl y could protect nim from
the faiury of the vilest of an ignorant and a
oijottej rabble, before whom the religion of the
country was diih >noured, the name of the Sove
reign insulted, and all law 8c order levelled in the
duit, to the disgrace, noc less of the integrity of
'he magistrates who were tiie fomenters, than of
ihe spirit of the pcoplÂ®, who were timid wirnelT'i
of the ravage and destruction. As little should
we re I peel any attempt, under colour of authority,
to fetcerdo.vn our minJs or prevent ihe publica
tion of our grievances, and our determination to
seek redicfs. In the puifuit of ref'oim, the great
measure indispensable to the freedom, the hip
/â¢njefs, and the glor/ of our country, we will iu
flexibl) perfevtre, aud fur its attainment we rely
with confidence on the steadiness, the public spi
rit, and the zealous co-operation of our country
men.

Extracl of a letter from the Territory of the United
States Joutb of the Ohio, of a lute date.
" The Cherokee apd Creek Indians have been
continually through the whole fdmiher commit
ting hpftiiitie.s and depredations on the fettle
men'ts of Cuinb^rla. l . Jâ-a white arid three
children Were purcfoafed in the m6,nth of July, by
a trader iff the Creel: nation, for 14061b. or deer
llcins, aud brought to Khdxviflc. S'.if huo been
taken from a itutioa near Bleclfoe's biik, on
Cumberland, where four white mfcn vVerf killed
and several persons taken prifoneu, who may no:
all be fortunate enough to be, ranformed frorn tor
ture and Indian barbarity. Several pe.Cons were
killed and wounded in the months of June and
July,, and a great number of horses raken oft
from the very vicinity of NafliviUe. An eX;>cn
five treaty was held about twelve months ago with
the Cherokees, and large presents difmbuted a
mong the towns and chiefs ; and they fetm to
adopt this policy to make another treaty neceila
ry, which will teiminate of course in another
douceur. Treaties are convenient things for the
Plenipoeson both lides, but nor quite so conveni
ent to an exhaufl d treafurv, where they
have made a heavy article in Mr* Hââ's account
of appropriations and expenditures. There is
certainly forne great deleft in the policy
of the United States with refpedt to these Indians :
the Executive of this country has eltablifhed the
character of firmneis and activity in its admini
ft ration j yet in refpeÂ£t to the Indians all is fee
blenefsâthey maraud and murder with impunity.
It is clear that this kind of mongrel government,
between a state 8c a colony does not poifefs iulfici
ent energy for its-own defence âit is indeed a
European exotic and mud languilh in the United
Statesâthey are obliged to depend on Congief
lloual nie a flirts for protection, and the Indians
.lave lott all rcverence for the National Govern
ment. and,view thfir languid ceremonious policy,
as a coulin german to Gen. St. Clair's military
