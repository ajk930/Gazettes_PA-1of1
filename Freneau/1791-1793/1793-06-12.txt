took place of which -we have noted
rie particulars in former payrs.]
AS IonÂ» as we had any hopes remaining
that an accommodation would prevent
the misfortunes that are ready to burrt upon
Port auPrincf*. we did not think it our du
tv to trouble you in relation to the private
concern" of our commerce. Ar present e
very thing reminds us that we have every
thing to fear; we should t>e bbme-w orthy
then if we did not exert ourselves, in the
r-.nnr of that national commerce whose
confidence we possess, to make such rtpre
fentations as will serve to the advance
ment of its "latereltâ¢
We not here undertake the de
fence of an li.ifortnnate town, now for
three yeiri part the -victim of perfidious
eondutt; e will begleave toobferve,hosv
ever, that it ispninftil for its inhabitants to
be actitfed of cronies without being fnffer
eJ to exculpate themselves; to fee them-
Xelvesmenaced with puniihment without,
being informed what crimes are laid to'
their charge. Will the delegates of the
nation condemn them without a hearing;
will they indiscriminately involve in their
proscription the friends of lawful govern
ment. the faithful children of the parent
country, and these who are ecculed of
being declared enemies of both?âNo; it
is impolÃble the breasts. of the commillion
ers can harbour so cruel a thought. But,
citizens com,niffiont rs, if we ihouldl for a
moment flatter ourselves with a ray ofhope,
liow can we otherwise then despair when
we reflect that t-y your proclamation of
the 2ut ofl*ft Muixh. you involved us
all in an indiscriminate fcntcnce of fttfpici
on, and held as curtain truths the {lander
ous assertions of our enemies, carrying des
pair into every heart by your threats of a
deplorable ti-anfportJtion of the merchants
of Port au Prince from their homes and
properties. What citizen would not
tremble, however innocent he might be,
to fee hii name on the lilt of the proscribed;
to be separated from his wife, his children,
his property, from those vai ious great and
sacred concerns which are intruded to him,
and to be dragged like a criminal to the
terrible tribunal ofthe national convention
of France I In our hands remain the for
tunes, and perhaps the last resources of
those valuable men, to whom the republic
of France owes its prosperity. In defend
ing their iyterefts, we defend those of
the mother country, who vflll fine' in their
generous and inexhaustible patriotism the
means of refitting the enemies of liberty :
and vet. for fifteen days palt all our buli
nefs is suspended. An embargo lias been
put upon our droguing vessels, that keep
up a commercial connexion with all parts
ofthe colony, supply those with provisions
which cannot be resorted to by vessels from
foreign parts, and serve as transport ves
sels for the commodities with which our
foreign fhipsare laden. And how shall we
answer the private engagements we have
made; how (upply the demands of our
correspondents in Europe, if all our abili
ties are thus fettered ?
The armament in our harbour wears a
menacing afpeft, and the land forces col
lefted trom the weltern quarter, are
brought hither to annihilate the I ast hopes
of national commerce instead of aiding the
citizens of Port au Prince and Croix des
Bouquets to support them. At this inltant
the revolters are wafting and burning the
rich possessions in Cul de Sac; instead of
hastening todeftroy the villains, you arm
against a town that is actually at war with
â¢ them, and which begs you for peace. You
retufeall intercourse with us, reject the
deputations we have lent to you. and-fliew
every hostile difpolition. Alas I do you
perceive how much future mifchiet is the
consequence of such steps. Do you know
that we have on lhore here our papers
and precious effects, and merchandize the
value of which is inestimable? that neither
these papers nor these articles of merchan
dize are our own, but that we are merely
the truttces of the greater part ? that their
deftruftion would occasion numberiefs
failures, which failures would bring on the
ruin 9fnational commerce, already shock
ed by the misfortunes it hasfuftained ; and,
finally do you knc\v,meflieur3 commifiion
ers.thatyou will be responsible for thÂ»felof
(es,and that fix millionsofunfortnnate peo
ple, who are supported by commerce, will
with cries of defpiir demand vengeance
on the national convention.
Can it be your intention to set at defi
ance this aweful refponlibility, and there
by reduce u$ todefpair? we can 110 lon
ger doubt it, finre the orders you have giv
en to the captains ef the merchant veue'3,
to anchor out fide of the ships of war.
What can be your deflgnsâwill you pro
ceed to the last extremities against a town
whose petitions you have refufed to hear?
we now declare to you in form that the
I order you have given to the mercantile cap
tains cannot be executed without efl'enti
, ally injuring the concerns of trade. In
deed, only call your eyes on the situation
of the vessels in the road, few of them are
loaded or even ballasted ; it would be next
to impofiible that they can go out ot the
harbour, or be conducted into the grand
road without being exposed to considera
ble damage, and probably to a total lof>.
Besides, moll of the captains have their
cargoes on shore, which they are obliged tc
guard carefully : and how can they attend
to this duty, if you order them away tc
the grand road, at so confiderablc a difl
ance from thsir property. Will you an
swer for it, that on your attacking the
towu the commercial magazines will bt
refpeftcd ; and would yÂ«u not be held re-
Jponfible for the loflTes that might happen
through plunder or conflagration ?
It is impoflible to calculate the evils at
tendant upon civil war ; and not one ol
them but is a mortal flab to the interefh oj
trade. Citizen commiflioners, before yot
proceed to extremities, refieft that peace i:
for the advantage of this colony, and thai
France Hands, in need of her commerce,
and that you yourselves will be held fori
oufly refponlible for the loss of either,
What is the meaning of that general em
bargo la.ii rolelv on tills port, w/lich put:
a flop to all ourbufinefs and occafians im

that obflinate silence you keep notwith

ally your design to canniuiade th,e town
and to deflroy in one inflant the merchan
dize and debts due to the national trade
for such wi the consequence oftlie leal
ast of hoflility on our part.
We repeat to you, is it a time when thi
revolters lay waste and burn the rich pof
fellionson the plain,when they are ruinin;
the sources of national commerce, that yot
think it your duty to excite a civil war 11

Citizen cojnmifiioncrs, we now declare
to you that this addref's is to be printec

transfer to yourselves all the refponfibilitj
we lay under to our conflituents, and thai
we will notify to them, that if they fuffei

you to prevent them. You are ruininj
the colony instead of saving it, and tindei
pretence of avenging affronts which Franct
has never received, you will soon plunge
her into mourning, misery and consternati

give peace to the citizens of Port au Prince
and be convinced that they are worthy o]
the Freuch republic, and do not inerii
{lander or abu'fe. Suffer truth to fliine in
to yoi\,and turn not away from the mirror
we hold up to you. In a short time you
will no longer be able to look at it ; the
misfortunes we predict will fall upon your
own heads will then re
gret that yon had not prevented them.
Ye depoluaries of national confidence, the

For the National Gazette.
THE absurd zeal of some idolaters of
monarchy among us, in makinga god
of the late king of Franse jhas, as usually
happens, driven some warm republicans
into the opposite extreme of makinga de
vil of him. So aifo the base and wicked at
tempts to quibble and pervert the honest
meaning of the treaty, with France, to
bUeken tlie character of the French patri
ot, and to turn thÂ£ stream of tfie republic
j '.'Â£lion from our republican friends and
a' ies towards a monarchical nation that
e en facrifiees her interest to her hatred
â¢"id afFefled contempt of us, have had a
liuilar eÂ£'eÂ£t ill routing honest paflions into a
fervour that would forget the blessings ol
peace and the pioper laws of neutrality.
It is the business of moderate men, who love
both their country aud the caule of liberty,
to check the folly of those who meaji well,
where it is thus produced and flimulated
by the orpolipe conduit cf others. It u
fiaterely to be desired that full credit
Ihotild be given to the unhappy Louis for
all the good qualities and merits he poflef
edj and that his weakiiefles, his vices, and
his guilty deeds Ifcould be no further re
membered or brought into view than may
be iiecefiary to do juftioe to a great patri
ots nation, and to Cave the cause of liber
ty aidhpmanicy from unmerited reproach.
Moderate men will upon the fame princi
ple wi Vto fee our country remain in peace,
a; -' leap all the benefits of neutrality, b>
a ~'e ct conduct that will give no just pro
utie hand. iior violate cm- e#.
gagements. our gratitude,or any of our mo
ral duties on the other.
Nothing is more certain than that a verj
refined policy calculated upon a felfilh scale,
generally outwits and always dishonours it
felf. This is a true and a trite observation
in private life, and holds equally as good ir
public affairs. For after all that has beer
said and written of the art of politics and
the maxims of (late, mankind seem to have
been brought back by the light of experi
ence to these simple honest truths, that the
best rule a nation can go by, is that which
should govern individual persons; and the
best rule individuals can follow is the e
vangelical one of doing to others as they
would have others do to them.
That we may therefore apply these rules
of condlift to the present cafe of America,
let us suppose that the French revolution
had happened before the American, and
that the people of America had been in a
state to heJp the French in the struggle for
their liberties, and had accordingly made s
generous treaty with them, sent them met
and money, and by these means had affifter,
and enabled the French to fliake off the ty
rannical yoke of kingly government, and
to eftiiblidi a free republican government,
like that of America, founded on the au
thority of the people, and intended for
their good. Let 11s next suppose that af
ter a (hort lapse of time an attempt were
made by a powerful monarchy, aided by
tyrannical princes and mercenary armies
for the purpose of robbing America of her
liberties and establishing over the people
the yoke of despotism. In this littiation,
let any candid virtuous man fay what sen
timents and difpolition might reafonablybe
expected by America from France in re
turn for what had palfed ; and in particu
lar let every American fay what he w 011UI
think of any set of men in France who
should endeavour to blacken the American
character, wish success to the despotic at
tack on her liberties, and do all thfy could
by indifett means, to forward the destruc
tion of a republican government in the
country of an ally and a benefactor that
had afiifted them in attaining a like free
government for their own country. The
leaft'that could be said would surely be,
thattheynruft either be void of the commoi:
feelings of men,or be falfe in their preten
ces of having any good liking to their own
republican government.
Those who have right principles in their
minds, with a tolerable snare of plain good
sense cannot, I think, be at any lofsto de
cide how Americans ought to feel, think,
and conduct in the present juncture t>f af
fairs.
[Total Numb. 169.]
As it would not he in our power to ren
der much aid by furce of arms to France,
and there is no ground to suppose that
France defiret or expeftsit, we are happily
freed from the only part of the quenioni
that could poflibly prove a difficulty or an
embarraflinent ; and under these circum
stances every honest American, friendly ro
the cause of liberty and humanity, and ihi
dious of the conlilfency and honour of his
country, must and will fay, Fir/1, The war
of the combined powers again!! the repub
lic of Fiance being notoriously dictated by
a malicious hatred againftthe rightsof nati
ons and the principles of liberty,ought tobe
execrated by every humane heart, and a
disappointment of their wicked designs
wilhed & prayed for by every rational and
well disposed mind.
Secondly, The obligations the treaty
with France, made when (o much needed
by America, Â«nd lb conducive to securing
to us the blessings ot freedom, now ilrug
gling for by France herfclf, ought to be
relig'oully discharged, and explained, with
out fophiitry or fubterfuge, in the obvious
sense and meaning of the parties at the
lime of making the fame.
Thirdly, Every external peaccable cx
prellion of kind and grateful afft-ftion to
the French republic is proper, and honour
able to the people of the United States.
Fourthly, 11 is their duly as men, as free -
men, and as confident Americans, as fur'
as they have a right by the law of ratio': s, to
favour and befriend the nation engaged on
the fide of liberty, humanity, and republi

the benefactor & supporter of America in a
like calife) and to refufe every ast of fa
vour and Iriendlhip that can br of right
withheld from the powers combined, as
every American believes and feels, ngainft
the laws of justice, and the lreedom and
happiness of bnman nature.
These are the sentiments, Mr. Freneau,
. MtiÂ» seem to row from apt filtioc
ration, combined with a iincere attach
ment to liberty. I believe, nay I am fine,
the> willbe found the real fentimems ofihe

To the want of fiuÂ«i a monitor, and to

to infallibility fhou'd not only be tolerated,
but supported by the bulk of mankind in

It is indeed strange that the glare of a
throne, or the splendor of a crown fhvuld
so far dazzle the eyeÂ» of men, as to make
the possessor of either appear to them far
superior to his fellow mortals, in vifdom
and integrity as well station.
Without attempting to account for the
origin of a species of idolatry so degrading
to the human charailer, fufiice it'to fay,
that all the artificcs of political ttiyftery

COOL REFLECTIONS relAtivetc
the FRENCH REVOLUTION.
Mr. Freneau,
T AM not one of those hackneved, c-olcT
*â  hearted politicians who think that go
vernments and nations have *-different rule
if action from individuals, that they ought
lot like individuals to follow the moral
:liÂ£tates of the heart; but Ihould in all (mi
nions csft aside every confederation btu
mere interest and advantage. I never couli.
"ee that it was improper for the whole tc
Jo what it would be meritorious in eacl
me in particular to do ; or that nation
which are described as moral persons, were
,ot bound and would not in the end j,ain
by arting in every regard according to tin
piecepts of morality. Nor could my mine
ever comprehend how a nation could L<
bound to one moral duty and not to ano
ther. If a natioi) ought to be jufl, wlij
noc a!Co generous, grateful, btncfictnt, aÂ»i;
charitable ; and this as well towards othei
ations *s towards its own members. Anc.
if honesty, as all hold, be the bell polic;
among nations, because it is so among indi
viduals, why is not generoficy, humanity
gratitule, &c. the belt policy alio ainon>
nations, feeing that the practice of thefi
virtues are as certainly the true policy ol
individuals, as the practice of jultice or ho
nesty itfelf. I conclude therefore that i
imi ft be the interest as it is the duty of tiu
United States to exejeife all the virtue:
[hat are praise \Â»orthy in private persons
aad confequelitly to pay the debt of grat:
tude, sympathy. and pood will, as well a:
the debt of gold or lilver, to all, whethei
i foreign nation or our own citizens, wlit
nay be entitled thereto. A contrary con
iuit would be as unwise as it would bc
mean; and would fallify all those magnaui
lious prot'eflions, and expanded principles,
which have spread afar the fame of our
neroes and statesmen, and given the cauft
if liberty, tirft cfpoufed by America, fuel!
Uuftrious merit in the eyes of mankind.--
The cralty and trickilh fnaxirns by whicl
kings and courts colour over the violatior
->r evalion of a moral policy, are growing
nto contempt even among theinfelves
through the experienced folly of them.
But here the queltion arises bttweer
America and France, whether the del to!
gratitude and friendfhip was contraftcil to
wards the French King or the French na
ion, I (hall try to conlider it with fair
:iefs and in as exatl a manner as breviu
will permit.
Gratitude implies that advantages have
seen conferred or intended, and the degree
ihereof ought to be proportioned to tin
7,reatnefs of the advantage combined witl
the benevolence of the motive. To deter
mine therefore, who it was, whether the
cing or the nation of France, that had the
mod claim to our gratitude, it mtift be con
idered which of them, principally, contri
buted the aids we received, and which wa:
-rned by til.' purelt motives of goof
will. Now this is i point that every grate
ful candid mind would fain decline, becetifi
-t iÂ» the temper of gratitude to think fa
vourably of the bencfaÂ£tor, and candour i:
jver ready to prefuine a good motive to t
jjood deed, where nothing appears to the
contrary. But in the orefent cafe as dif
ferent and clalhing claims are set up, we
,re compelled to examine and compare
them.
The advocates for the merit of the king
tell us it was he that made the treaty ol
independence ; he supplied us with money ;
he it was that sent out fleets and armies to
fight for us. It would not be unfair to
alk here whether he adopted these raea
fures as the magistrate and of the
nation, or merely of himfelf, without re
gard to the fenl'e and inclination of the na
tion ; for on the Jalt fuppolition iE ii im
possible to approve his conduit, tho' we
happened to g>-t fomethlng by it; and on
the other fuppoiition the nation will be let
in for the principal lliare of the merit. I
will not however purine this argument on
account of the difficulty of fettling the cx
aft relation between the king and the na
tion, under the old government ; but pro
rÂ°ed to observe, that as to the pecuniar;,
supplies from France, they w ere nil in fac<
contributed by the nation, .and not by the
king. The money came out of the pocket?
of the people : it was made out of the la
bour of their hands and the sweat of their
brows. It is even true, (tho I take no
pleasure in the remark, nor would make it
if not-called for by the occalion) that not a
livre sent us, as I have ever under!.ocd,
was spared out of the sum appropriated to
the accommodation of the king (if it had,
[ it was dill money drawn from the pockets
of lite ptop'e) Lilt so much taxed as an ad
ditional burden on the nation. And as to
i,he bloodifhed ia our behalf. whose.was ii ?
Surely, not the king's. His little finger
never acted, nor was a hair of his head in
danger l>y reason of the war. Those who
fought for us were a part of the nation,
the foils, and brothers, and fathers of the
French people. They were fed and cloath
ed and lupported at the expence of tin
people, cheerfully afforded as we have good
reason to believe. And, excepfingperhaps
a pari of the officers, they are at this time
fighting on the fide of the naticn agaijift all
its royal combined enemies. Surely then
die benefits received by America from
France are to be set down principally to
the nation rather than to the king.
Next, for the motivesâand these may be
analyzed into three.: 1. A hatred aguinft
Great-Britain on paftfcores.â2. A jealou
-7 of future danger from her incrtafing
iuwer and refourcis.â3 A good will to
wards the people of America in the caufo
Â»/ liberty w.herein (he had embarked.
Now, as to the tirft motive it was doubt
iefs felt ffrongly both by the government
nation of France. The second was in like
manner a motive with both, as we may 111-
turally suppose, in proportion to the atreti-
Lion given to the dangerous growth of the
Britillj empire. But it is the third and 1..1t
motive only which America is to regard li
the true and laudable object of her grati
tude. And does it require a moniert's
confederation to determine that there v. as
more of diltinjuillied cordial fympatby v. ith
lis, whilst for o;;r.; ; jlus a:.d li
berties, in the people of France, than in
:ie king ? If ~iiy man in hi; could
ji er have supposed otherwise, \ â¢ null! now
be convinced by fails and events. For the
Irencb nation is now at war ag; hilt the
uhole world, a; it were, in that very cuife
â¢ii liberty and humanity in which they a.dcd
iiid befriended America ; and the unfortu
nate Louis has fallen a aielancho y victim
to his apoltacy therefrom.

was also published trorp general Cuftine, to
Che French minister at war, dated Worms,
March 30, detailing some disastrous events,
jarticularly the loss of the post of Bingen,

" The intelligence which we communi

" The posture ofaffairson our frontier is

[ Frow a French paper. 3
Copy of a'letter from V iennu, *jth March.
" Tile hopes of this court are not at all
abated : it flatters itfelf that tlie league of
despotic powers againlt France can meet
with few or no obllacles; no expence, no
pains are spar.cl to increase the number ot
combined enemies. The court of Vienna
particularly applauds herfelf for having io
happily diverted the attention of the peo
ple from their true interest, and entirely
corrupted their opinion in regard to the
nature ofthe French revolution. The no
bility, and all who hold a share i-n the ad
ministration of the government appear
enthulialHcplly devoted to the cauie ot
kings. However, notwithstanding all their
brilliant hopes, there is a fort of disquiet
prevailing among them vilible to the
fliohteft observer. The conlideratiuti,
that if republican France is not cnilhecl
and the war ended the prelent campaign,
gives extreme uneasiness, it being certain
thac prolonging it another year w ill involve
the "overnment in inextricable difficulties.
This reflexion alone damps the jov ot the
Germans even on the reception of the molt
favourable news. The people ofrepub.i
can France begin to be e.n object of terror,
and there is the ftrongelt rcul'on to believe
ihat the house of Aphria has at this mo
ment a set of proportions drawn up to
make peace with France upon any terms,
provided (he expressly disavows the repub
ican fyltern. There is another confa.era
ion that gives the prevailing party here no
mall trouble. It is forefeen that Fiance
tvill become a more military nation thai>
?ver by being preiled with the "league ot
joweis : the confequeiue will be that the
eague will be deserted by lome, and the
magnanimous exertions of France will Â£ a " 1
ter alliesaniong other powers. France will
.lien be at liberty to hurl perpetual ven
veance upon the house of Aultriajfrom gen
ration togeneration, till all her tyrants are
extincther peopU lree-,â 1 he present cam
paign will cxhi-.ult the vigour cf the ceffl
jination in a great titfgree, for every thing
w ill be done that it is puflible to do. Ten
.ot.Sand Croats are inarching to join Gen.
Wurmfer, who are deligned to enter Al
!a:e. The remembrance of the cruelties
ommitted in this department in 1744 by
: icfe barbarians is still alive, although the
French at lalk expelled them with horrid
fljuzhter. It is hoped they will again ex-
a fiiruiar fact froiii the hands of
free people."

Letter written by the Municipality of
Croix-les-Bouquets,, to Santfianax,
National Civil 'Comvpjfioner, Aprils.
'' /"CITIZEN Commifiioner, you have
been informed by the citizen go
vernor general, pro tempore* of *fc-hat has
palled in our quaiter since the 20th oi
January k(l.â~An unfortunate infurrec
t ion, of which the consequences are well
known, has made its appearance in the
plain country : conCderablc bodies of the
insurgents colle&ed in force ; and we ap
plied to our brethren of Port au Prince foi
relief, who generously came to our aflill
ance, and have continued it from January
24th to this day. The services of tliofe
brave citizenshave been conllantly devoted
to us,but notwithflanding their endeavors;
notwithftandiog we have killed a greal
number of the reyolted villains in the le
vera! engagements we had witkthem ; w(
Jolt all hope of reducing them before tin
rainy season set in, unless strongly rein
force. J by our brethren of Mirebalais
L'Arcahaye, Leogsne, and Petit-Guave,
PArcahaye, Leogane, and Petit-guave,
We had already received the ftrongcil as
finances 'hat our brethren of Martbalait
would march to our al:iftancc with 20c
men ; one hundred w.ll accoutred cavalry
"were also getting ready to adill uj from 1'
Arcahai e ; and a hundred more from Leo
gane. We were making preparations tc
receive these generous friends and bre
thren, who having formed a cordial unior
.with owr brethren of Port au Prince and
ourselves, might have crufhrd the revolten
by attacking them on every quarter. Wt
â were in full hopes of completely re-e(lab
lifhing order before the rainy season, when
all on a sudden a prpc'amation, issued b)
you. was sent ir.ro the several parishes, anc
pjlfied all our (Irength. Those brave
friends and brethren of ours, who were foi
the dHe execution of the laws, found them
felvcs fettered at the moment they wÂ«Â«
flying to our afiiilance. and from an inci
dent, oi which we had net the moil dif
tant appreheiifion, we found ourselves in j
Ctur.tion wot ie tl.a i death. Not having
received your proclamation ofHcially, Citi
zen Coromiflioner, we only knew of its ex
iileiice by means of letters from the muni
cip-litics of M'r.-balats and Port au Prince.
We do not alk why it was not transmitted
to U3: but will you believe, that of all
the great misfortunes we have experienced
Jince the revolution, the gteateft have ori.
ginated from your proclamation ? by
means of this fatal ediA we found ourselves
3t once deprived of a powerful aid, the
only jfliftance that it was pofGble for us to
procure-,, fjnee of all the tr.Â»ops sent hither
from the mother coun'ry, none came
among 11s, and yet we are equally her
children, art'! it is not her intention to
abandon us. By your proclamation, Na
tional Civil Commissioner, you exposed us
to the necefilty of abandoning our pro
pe-ty,Jf brethren of Port au Prince
relinejuiflien our cause. If we are forced
to decamp, at that moment the revolt will
become general, and that part of the flat
countr, which is rtill in our pofFeffion,
will become the prey of robbers and
plunderers, and consequently the reft of
thi province also.âFor two months pall
our brethren of Port au Prince have ex
posed themselves to defend our property,
an ' for the fame space of time have fur
nifr.ed v.a with all the means in their power
for fubfifiing the citizens employed in our
defence. For two months they have
granted an asylum to our women, children
and old men ; snd lastly, for two months
have they lodged and fed all fuel; of oli
unforlonate felloiv citizens, who had no
other place of refuge from the fury of the
Brigands (negro robbers) bu! the bosom
ps tliefe generous brethren. We are ig
norant of what have been the supposed
.crimes of that unhappy town: all we
know is, that it has yielded obedience to
the decree of the 4th of April, that it has
been attached to the defence of our pro
petty, and that (he furnifiied uÂ» with im
portant means of defence. ,
What 1 eitrzen national civil commission
er, do you delay tc> march out againfl the
Brigands after the reduft on of Port-au
PrinceâWhat! are you in hopes that the
citizens of Cul de Sac will arm againfl
their friends and brethren, againfl the ci
tizeti3 who flied their blood for them, ar.d
lastly, againfl a town from which they have
received favours without number' â
national civil commissioner, we
think you
have been deceived, and that you are ra
ther officious in adminidering justice to
viituous citizens already obedient to the
law, and who always look for a father and
a protestor in a national delegate. Citizen
commissioner, the nation sent you hither
to rertore public order and tranquility : a
civil war is upon the eve ofbuHlini* out,
hasten to receive the proofs of afFection
from the citizens of Port-au-Prince, and
you will find that they are the great sup
port of the Preach revolution in this
country. Do not dqlay to come in per
son, and be a witness of our situation, and
you will confcfs it to be ind/fpenfibly ne
cefiary to employ all the dr'ength of th<
colony in reducing the feives, and that the
had delay owl bÂ«teeised with the moll
ferions invite the paiiflies
who are coming to onr relief, to fly and
join to our dear neighbours those forces,
which are at your difjjofal. By this means
you will become our deliverer, and gain
our entire afFeftion."
\_From the General Advertiser..]
THE great even:s which hare of la:c si;
rapidly succeeded each other in Europe,
astonish the observer and have baffltd ali
expectation and calculation. Dumourier,
not IoÂ»g since the object of our warmefl
praises, now deserves with more justice,
our fevered execrations. The belt friends
of the French cause have been heard more
than once, while he was at the zenith cl
his glory, to lament that a man of his more
than doubtful principles (hould ast so im
portant a part in their armies. His mili
tary /kill is acknowledged on all hands ;
but his employers, it >vell ascertained,
especially of late, much doubted the since.
rityofhis political principles, and enter
tained- serious fears from the well known
vsifatility whi h formed a principal fea
ture of his character, and his popularity
with his army alone, determined his sup
porterÂ» in the National Convention from
abandoning a man fit for the base in
trigues of a corrupt con t, and not for a
soldier in the cause of equality.
His defection in the ifl'ue is nothing (hort
of a victory over the arts of despotism and
the m, chinatious of traitors. His pre
emption persuaded him, that the cause
relted on his flloulders, that in his-army he
was all powerful, and that if his army wil
led a king the nation mull have a kin-g.
The Austrian commander Cobourg ap
pears o have entertained the fame senti
ments ; but both were egregioufly deceiv
ed, because neither had calculated the en
ergy of a whole people, ftruggiing to pre
fcrve that freedom, they had risen to aflert :
and had tailed tho' imperfectly.
That Dumourierendeavoured to reflore
a limited monarchy and to prevail on his
army to f- pport him in tile attempt, is as
certained beyond a doubt l that he proved
totally unfuccefsful, and was obliged to fly
to the Audrians with a few of his crea
tures, is equally Accounts diffei
as to the number of his followers; bul
none exceed a few hundred, and mod agre;
that he escaped the just resentment, if hi<
patriotic army narrowly indeed.
It is worthy of remark, (and theobfer
vation will put the charafterof traitors and
tyrants in their true light) that bot|i Du
mourier and Cobourg's manifedoes contain
the mod palpable absurdities. Dumourier
after fighting like a lion in the cause ol
repuUicanifm declares, that France can be
happy under monarchy only, and Cobourg
as the organ of the confederacy declares,
that the former French conditution is what
France should have, though that very con
st l ution was the pretext with Audiia and
/russia to commence hostilities against the
nationâWhen the paths of reaion and ol
right are abandoned, it is not possible tc
ast confidently.
Time alone can discover what Dumou
r,er's v:cws were, when he espoused
the cause of liberty with such apparent
warmth ; it is surmised he was wholly im
pelled by views of felfilh ambition. Time
will also determine whether his treachery
was not also occasioned by another eccen
trie flight of that wild passion : Be it as it
may ; his charafler is now marked with
its real damp, and the doom of a traitor
awaits him.
The mind turns with pleasure from a
view of the b?fe conduct of a man whose
talents might have dtferved him immor
tality, to the contemplation of a great na
tion druggling under accumulated difficul
ties. We find her representatives calm in
rnidit of tTie florm, and deliberating
with firninefa and precision. From their
courage .'nd perfcv ranee, from the justice
tht which is that of humanity,
we anticip. hat the republic will rife
superior to every difficulty, secure by hei
success, h.r liberties., and emancipate the
world.
