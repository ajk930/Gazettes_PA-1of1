Gent trtien,
A MONG the various fubje&s which at
p efent occupy the attention of the
public, the conduct of the Company of the
Jupiter seems to he none of the least intc
reltingâth â  Oieculative mind of the publii
js held in fnfpenfe, and not knowing the
jnotives 0.1 which they have a&ed, canno:
form a proper judgment of their conduit.
The following addrefles, therefore,
they rend conliderably to elucidate th
lubj ?Â£t, can lot fail of be ng aeceptab e.
The fir.l which was sent to Citizen Ge
ret, requires little explanation. The
Company of the fnpiter, anxious to inve
the caules and tn discover the authors 01
the late e.i â  mities committed at Cape
Irancois, in which they were influenced to
bear a part, and of which we *1 iv every

Convention, toanfwer for their reflective
conduct before that augiift tribunalâand

" There is Something rotten in the Jlate of
Denmark."
WHEN my great ancestor made the
above declaration âno matter, whe
ther in real history or profitable fableâit
may, too often, be applied to all govern
ments.
My fellow citizens will agree wiih me,
that there is something rotten in every ad â 
jniniftration of Europeâwill it then be
criminal to make a fair enquiry, as to our
own ? Can the examination do us any real
injury ? The fabric is alnsofl newâif it is
unsound, there must have been some
bad materials in its composition : if it
is weak, lome original fault, in its con
ftruftion : if injured, there must be bad
management, by some part of the family,
who h -vc had the care of itâleaving it to
the good sense of the people to decide 011
the fact, it (hall be my province to state to
them, fo-ne material and striking instances
of past mismanagement, in the government
as their affairsâfome notorious abnfes of
their confidence ânot to look back for jus
tice, but to be on their guard, for the fu
ture. to prevent them.
I am a federalift, an advocate for unity
of empireâl do not with to injure our fe
deral government âI vvifh to correfl and
amend itâif it is tolerably good, may the
people preft-rve it so. But it wiil soon
grow worse, if we do not watch it.
Set it down as a maxim, my fellow citi
sspns, that eve'y nation under heaven, let
their government be ever so good will
soon find it perverted and corrupted, if
the people are not continually active to pre
vent it. Do we not fee the faÂ£t every hour
.âthat when the heir of an estate leaves the
management of it to agents, they soon ma
nage it for tbtmfelves âit he lets them
have long pofleffion, they will dispute his
title deeds, and call it their own.
Ininy future letters, I will demonstrate
the force of this maximâat piefent, a
matter of high import, preffeson my mind,
as neceflary for our immediate decifios.
The pretended misunderstanding betweer
our firft magistrate, and the French mimf
ter, may and will be attended with tht
word of consequences, if not iiiflantly done
away. Our union was never more necef
faiyâit was never more feverelv attacker
ânothing, that I can figure to my imagi
nation, could more completely g'ut the
malignant pride and wishes of our Ameri
*in tories, and their Englilh associates.
than a fcrious dispute between France anc!
America. By our alliance, they have been
reduced to infignificance and ihameâby
our divisions tliey may reaflume their
haughtiness and importance. It is evident
that the lie they have propagated, is be
lieved, even by the Preiident, by Mr. Jay.
and Mr. King ; of course, it has had credit
among the people. Ask the President, il
the minister made such a declaration to
|jj m âhis answer implies a negativeâJa>
and King fay they heard it from Hamilton
Hamilton heard it from KnoxâKnox
heard it from MifflinâMifflin from his fe
cretary âhis secretary from God knows
W here is,the man then who has heard it?
If those principal officers ot our govern
ment, do not, openly, and immediately.,
acknowledge this matter to be a lieâthat
they were betrayed into a bel.ef of it, t|iey
may expeit their fellow citizens will form
a molt unfavourable conclulipn. i hey
will, and ought to suppose, that the thief
leaders of our- administration, have from
inclination, given weight to the vile re
port, ; wishing to find a pretence lor their
cold conduct towards our flittering allies.
âAlas 1 what a change in the language
of our governors ! When we wanted
men. money and arms, these generous
Frenchmen were ourgreat and good friends
âwe the grateful sons of freedom ready to
spill onr blood in payment, for efficient
aid. Mr. Genet has too much delicacy to
reproach usâbut feeling as I do, all the
love and gratitude I felt, as a citizen in
1778, I may freely express my opinion. I
difllke, and disapprove, not only the pro
clamation, but the tenor of the conduct o'
our executive towards France, for some
time pad. Wehave-fent a minister there,
who has inceffanily abused the National
Convention, with illiberal epithets and
bitterness ; who has offended their minis
ters not to be forgivenâand he is con
tinued again ft the will of the nation. In
dead of offering them our services, one oj
nur admimftration is supposed to be now
ivritinga gainst their-conftruftion of one of
the molt disinterested and generous treaties
that ever a nation conceived or executed.
I Will venture to fay, that had the hearts
us the honest whigs, w lwÂ» fought our bat
tles ; who carried our President 10 victory
and tame, 011 bare feet, been flittered K
"peak, at ihis important crisis, their lan
milage would have been nearly this.Brave
and worthy Frenchmen, we do not forget
nor do we wifhtodeny, that the land* we
now pofleft, the peace we now enjoy, the
wealth we now acquire, the very libertj
we so highly value, was Jeciired by you-.
tell us how to repay thedebt of gratitude.'
They would have laid to England, "We
have 110 politive with .0 do you injury we
lave forgiven your fins, though of crimfor
dye, in the blood of our country ; but yet
have no claims on our friendlhip, having al
ied yourlelves to the highway robbers of
the world ; be Satisfied if we take 110 part
igainft you." I will, for example fake,
uppofe the cafe of an individual. Had 1
blind a man, in the hands of a ruffian, who
lad robbed his house, bound his children,
ind was, that moment, aiming a blow,
hatmuft have ended his life and the hopes

NEW-YORK, August 22.
Every good republican cannot be other
wise than highly piealed with the manly
ind firm.letter of Citizen Genet, which
tppeared yefteiday. Instead of defct;nd
ng to a newspaper controversy with his
rweinies, he boldly appeals to the only per
-011 who could know . tor a refutation of
he chargeâwhile his letter breathes the
anguage of a man, sensible to the indignity
iffered him : it does not merely lolicit the
President's intervention, or throw a veil
DÂ»er his palt conduct. He reminds him
if the remonstrances he has had occasion
;o make, but calls 011 him as a man ofpro
jity, to deny the actuation, of his threat
ening to appeal to the people. It is to be
amented that it did not comport with the
President's dignity, tu answer the letter
limfelf. Some think that a letter from
:he President to a Minifler from the firlt
nation on earth, when appl; ing to him on
3 per/onal and confidential, and not on an
official or diplomatic fubjotl, would not
hzve derogated from his honor, more than
writing to Mr. Crugar, as chairman of tie
meeting in front of Trinity Church. There
was a liine when the President would
have afled a less stately part, Jed'tempora
mutautur et nos muiamuv cum illis!
From Mr. Jefferfon's answer, it appears
that the President could, if he hud pleased,
;>ear evidence against the declaration ot
Mr. Jay and Mr. King: as he withheld
this teltimony, it wÂ«uld have been in cha
ra&er, to have been equally tenacious ol
his opinion. It was for a fact, not an opi
nion, that citizen Genet applied to him.
No part of citizen Genet's letter to the
President has given greater oiience to
itie good people of this city, than that
in which he calls his Britannic Majefly a
tyrant-âwhatever America might have
once thought of this grtat perl'onage, flu
now th inks him a very clever fellow: Citi
zen Genet, w ill please therefore, to ex
punge this exceptionable expreflion in the
next publication of his letter or he wil
hear something from a legion of citizens 1
It is high time the crown on the upper
extremity of the spire of St. George';
Chapel flwjuW be taken down, V/ithom
administering liints for that purpose thro'
the public prints. The high churchmen
afl'ert that it is not very easily taken down,
owing to the crown's being fixed to the
fame spindle which runs through the iron
work below, and that it turns with the
vane. Notwitliftanding these difficulties
the nuijance complained of might be easily
done away, and at a (mail expense, by co
vering the crown over with the cap of Li
berty. This would make a much better
appearance than that relique of tyranny,
and would convince our fellow citizens, as
w ell as foreigners, that the congregation
is not so loyal and warmly attached to
crowned heads, as people in general ima
gine. We are told of a church.jn Phila
delphia with a mitre on the fjiire. Jt is
high time such baubles were taken down,
as they are an abomination in the eyes ol
every true republican.
By fimdry letters from an officer in tin
vjejlern country, to. a gentleman in Staun
ton, (Virginia) dated July 2, 1793, ve
learn the following : â
" That general Wayne, with about eocc
men, had arrived at fort Walhington on
the 7th of May, and more w ere expected ;
they encamped 011 the banks of the Ohio,
but were not expefled to remain there
long. Gen. Wilkirifon, on the 27th oi
May, was encamped, with a few companies
of infantry and one of artillery at Lud
low's (on Mill Creek) five miles advanced
of Fort Walhington : he had opened a
road from fort Walhington to Fort Ha
milton (about 27 or 28 n.iiei) 4ofcet wide,
and cleared of everv obflruction. A few
days previous to this, capt. Cufhing had
been out at Forts Jefferfon and St. Clair,
picking cut the invalids and all such as
were riot fit fcr aÂ£lua! service. These are to
Â£0 to gai rifons, and the companies from
which ihey are taken, will be sided up
with those from the garrison- fit for in.me

taken toFort J fferfon, where it is expect
ed the greater part of the army will soon
be. In the beginning of June, colone!

Dbfervation applies with peculiar propriety
and truth to this country. We find at lead

HISTORY OF the BOHON UPAS.
(Concluded, from our lajl.j
THE violent effedt of ihe poison at so
great a dillance from the tree, cer
tainly appears surprizing, and almost in
credible ; and efpeciaily when we consider,
that it is possible for delinquents who ap
proach the tree, to return alive. My
â wonder, however, in a great mafure
â ceased, after I had made the following
observations : â-I have said before, that
malefa&ors ere inftiudted to go to the
tree witli the wind, and to return againll
the wind. When the wind continues to
blow from the fame quarter while the
criminal travels 30 or 36 miles, if he be
not far pafled the prime of life, and of a
good conllitution, he certainly survives.
But what proves the molt deftrudtive is,
that there is no dependence on the wind
in that part of the world for any length of
lime. There are no regular land winds j
and the sea wind is not perceived there at
all, the situation of the tree being at too
a d.stance, and surrounded by high
mountains and uncultivated forefts. Be
sides, the wind there never blows a frefh
regular gale, but is commonly merely a
current of light, foft breezes which pais
through the different openings of the Â«d
joining mountains I is also frequently
difficult to determine from what quarter
â ef the hoiizon the wind really comes, as
it : s divided by various obstructions in its
pafTage, which easily change the direction
of the current of aii and often totally de
stroy its ess fts. I therefore impnee the
diftanl effects of the poison, in a great mea
sure to the frequent gentle winds in those
parts, which have not power enough to
disperse the poisonous particles. If high
winds were more frequent and durable
there, they would certainly weaken very
much, and even deltroy the obnoxious ef
fluvia of the poison but . itliont them;
the air remains infected, and pregnant witli
these poiionous vapours.
I am the more convinced of this, ss tin:
old eccleliaftic assured me that a dead
calm i 3 always attended with the greatell
danger,, as there is a continual perspirati
on issuing from the tree, which i 9 seen tÂ«
tife and fprcad in the air like the putrid
fleam of a marihy cavern.
It may probably be asked why no ef
forts have been made to deflroy fa dread
ful a tree âmore dreadful indeed, in rs
effects, than plague, pestilence, and fa
mine united. The reasons are obvious.
No man, without abfolutc certainty oi
death, could venture to remain near it for
so long a space of time, as wonld be re
qtiifite to cut down a tree of such magni
tude, which if once wounded to any con
siderable depth, would in a moment de
flroy an army of men with its deadly de
-1 terious eftluvia : Nor could materials to
set it on fire be carried en to the place
without almost certain deftrudion, the
fire, as it were, drawing r;:pidly to a cen
ter the violent energy of the dirfufed poi
sonous particles. Befidcs all this, the
emperor derives a very considerable reve
ime from the sale of the gum, which is
used for various purposes, but more parti
cularly iu war and executions.
In the year 1776, in the month of
February, 1 was present at the execution
of thirteen of the emperor's concubines
at Soura Cbarta, who were convicted of
infidelity to the Emperor's bed, It wai
in the forenoon, about eleven o'clock,
when the fair criminals were led into ar
open space, within the walls of the em
peror's palace. There the judge passed fen
temcc upon them, by which they wen
doomed to, fuller death by a lancct poison
id with the gum of the Bohon Upas. Af
ter this thcAlcoran was prefefitedto them
:ind they were, according to the law ol
their great Mahomet, to 'acknowledge
and affirm upou oath, that the charges
brought them, together with the
sentence and their punishment, were fail
and equitable. This they did, by laying
their right hand upon the Alcoran, their
left hands upon their breads, and their
eyes lifted toward, heavenâThe judge
then held the Alcoran to their lips, and
tliev kifTed it.
These ceremonies being over, the exe
cutioner proceeded on his bufitiefs in th.r
following manner :âthirteen polls, each
about five feet high, had been previously
er-.-ited. To these the delinquents wert
fattened, and thuir breads dripped n Iced.
In this lituation they remained a fhori
time in continual prayers, attend by feve
ral prieds, unti : aiigiul was given by thi
judge to the executioner ; on which tht
latter produced an indrument, much like
the spring la.ice*ufed by farriers for bleed
ing horses. With this indrument, it be
iwg pi.!foiled with the gum of the Upas,
the u hanpy wretches wert lanced in the
middle of their breads, and the operatior
wis performed upon them all in less thar
two minutes. My adonifliment was raifec
to the higheddegree,when I perceived thÂ«
sudden tffefts of that poilon ; for in a
bout five miuutes after they were lanced
they were taken with a tremor of the
nerves, after which they died in the great,
ed agonies, crying out to God and Ma
homet for mercy. In sixteen minutes, by
my watch, which I held in my hand, al
the criminals were no more. Some houn
after their death I observed their bodiei
full of livid spots, their faces swollen.
their colour changed to a kind of a livid
blue, their eyes looked yellow, Bcc &c.
About a fortnight after this I had at
opportunity of feeing fnch another exe
cution at Samarang. Seven Malayans wert
executed there with the fame kind of in
drument, &in the fame manner, & I found
the operation of the poison, and the spots
on their bodies, exactly the fame.
These circumdances made me dtfirout
to try an experiment with fomÂ« animals,
in order to be convinced of the real ef
fÂ«dts of this poison : and as I had then
two young puppie3, I thought them the
fitted objects for my purpefe. I accor
dingly procured with fonie difSeully some
grains of Upas. I diifjlved half a giair
of that gum in a smalt quantity of arrack,
and dipped a lancet into it. With this
poisoned indrument I made an incifior
in the lower muscular part of the belly
of one of the puppies; three minuUs-aftei
it received the wound, the animal begar
to cry out mod piteou/lv, and ran as fad
as possible ftom one corner of the room tc
the other So it conti med during fix
minutes, when ail its drengih being ex
haud.-d, it fell upon the ground, was ta
ken with conÂ»ulfions, and died in thf
eleventh minute. I repeated this expe
11'ment will) two rvh, r puppies, as alfc
with a cat and a tewl, and found the ope
ration of the poiiuu in all of them the
fame; none of thofa animals surviving
thirteen minutes.
I thought it necefTary to try alio the
effect of the poison given inwardly, which
I did in the following manner. I dif
solved a quarter of a grain of the gum in
half an ounce of arrack, and made a dog
of seven months old drink it. In seven
minutes a reaching ensued, and I observed
at the fame time that the animal was de
lirious, and as it ran up and down the
room, fell on the ground and tumbled a
bout ; then it xofe again, cried out very
loud, and in about half an hour afterwards
was seized with convulitons, and died.
I opened the body, and foujid the do
mach very much inflamed, as the inteftiues
were in some parts, but not so much as
the domach There was afmall quantity
of coagulated blood in the domach, but 1
could discover no orifice from which it
could have JfluecJ, and therefore fuppofedl
it to have been Squeezed out of the lungs,'
by the animal's straining wliilft it was
vomiting. From these experiments I
have been convinced that the gum of the
Upas is the molt dangerous and mod vi
olent of all vegetable poisons : and I am
apt to believe that it greatly contributes
to the known unhealthinefs of the island
of Java. Nor is this the only evil at
tending it, hundreds of the natives, as well
as the Europeans are yearly deltroyed
and treacherously murdered by that poi
son, either internally or externally. Eve
ry man of quality or fafhion has his dag
ger or other arms poisoned with it ; ant
in times of war the Malayans poilon thi
springs and other waters with it; by this
treacherous pra&ice the Dutch fuffered
greatly during the lad war, as it occasion
ed the loss of half their army. For tlii;
reason they have ever since kept fi(h it
t'.e springs, ot which they drink the wa
ter ; and centinels are placed near them,
who infpedl the water every hour,- t<
fee whether the fi!h are alive. If they
march with an army or body of troop;
into an enemy's country, they always car
ry living fifh with them, which they
throw into the water (sue hours before
they venture to drink- i , by which mean
only they have been able to prevent theii
to al deltrudion "
In future, thole who visit the iflan'd ol
Java will probably now be induced t(
make the Bohon Upas an obj 61 of then
rclearchcs, and will furnifli us with a fui
ier description of this wonder:* ' tree.
