Please giv& the following a place in youi

1 To the Jndcpenutta EleSort c ile Covnty oj
Montgomery.
FriÃnds and Fellow.Citlzens,
YOU are now about to be cabled t-pon,
to exertife one of your mult iacred
constitutional privileges ; that or electing
your own i iprefentatives in ( ongreis, or
to give it up to a set of as ignorant arbitra
ry nabobs, as ever disgraced a country-
Can you, my fellow citizen 3, view with
calmnefa their late proceedings ar cour.ty
and toarnfbip meetings, without expref-
Gng your disapprobation and abhorrence
thereof? The firlt county meeting at
Tyfon's, (Edward Shipperi jun. in the
chair) was called in a clandeitine manner
by private letters directed to none but the
well-born "junto ; they, indeed, attempt
ed to seduce your honest i.nator to join
tliem in their diabolical proceedings, but
he is too good a friend to the rights of
man, to do any thing that has a tendency,
to destroy the right of free elections.â
This meeting cnnfilted of the chairman,
the recorder of the county> and his clerk,
Mr. Wh....r, their magpye Secretary,
and three of their laquies, These few
would-be-nabobs hatched the infamous
plan of recommending township meetings
to eleÂ£t committees to meet at Tyfon't
the 20th of August, to chufc conferree's
to meet at Lancaster, to ele<Â£t elcÂ£tors and
fix a ticket for Reprefentaiives in the
Corgrtfs c-f the United State?. Some
few individuals in different townlhipi thai
were tinder the influence of the nabobs or
t eir tools, met, & fen t forward committees
some cf which were voted b.y thri-e persOns
only; eleven committees thus chosen, met,
(out of 38 which the county carditis of,
Jon?than Roberts in the chair) and voted
as if they were a majority, conferrees to
go to Lancaster, and recommended town,
fliip meeting* on the 22d, to meet at their
refpedtive places of choosing township of
ficers, there to chufe three persons to at
tend a general county meetings to be held
at John Wentz'sthe 29th, to fix a ticket
for representatives in assembly tic. for
iaid county, at the ensuing election.
Can you, my fellow citizens, fuffer
' yourftlves to be duped and led by the nofc
by such a set of wou'd bee's, the- profcll
tools of yourlo'rdly and arbitrary Pro-- yr
lit me ask you, do you mean to resign
your liberties into the hands of three base
usurpers, and thereby establish ariltocracy,
or do you mean to hand down to pofleritv
the invaluable privileges which God and
nature have given you, inviolate : If the
latter, unite as a band of bsoihers, to de
feat th; wicked machinations of this felf
created junto, and by every confutations!
ificans in your power, counteract, and en
p'ofethem in the light they deserve. I
\;V. ild ask ymi where some of these well
born, fkn'.ked, from the year 177610 1780?
werÂ£ they seen at county meetings form
ing committeestofave the liberties of their
'country, and the forces of an infnlt
-1 Â»ng ;...d victorious foe I No ! They were
fecictly exulting at their success, and e:;
claiming againit these firm patriots, who
had fpiril to serve their country faithfully.
T\ nt now with the molt confun mate im
pudence they co â¢ e forward and tell you
as plain as language can exptefs, that ycu,
.la r.oi 11.010 hotv to make use of your liberties
you rr.ujl andJhall five â¢will even compel you.
fay they, to) delegate them to us. And will
yon my friends and fellow citizens fuffer
yourselves to be duped and d'itaterf toby
this junto of felf created, ariltocratical 11a
fe>bs,or will you with manly firmnefr,
ihewthem at the county meetings, and
at the enluing eledtion that you are ce
t'ermined to be free ?

you fliotrd be careful- that you do not in

jtf men in Virginia as weli aa myfelf, who

ir illulliate them by argument. To con

)ur present system of govern.nent is not

milt convince ine that we are deprived oi
hat inestimable blessing a free reprelerita

'oice of the people ought ever to be the
foice of a tree government ; when this ia
lot the cale liberty is endangered â
By a numerous and an equal repreferitati-
M) alone, the evil can be rectified, and it
t exilts, our Hate constitution ought, a.id

I am equally alarmed with yours if, at

â ome insupportable, an excise is laid, an in
quitous and oppreihve ' â¢ ; oppressive,
Decaufe it is a tax on labou. j and iniqui

11 tliit country, where an excise is fuffcr

London, July i 6. To fuffer Poland to
he over-vim and reduced to a (kte of the
moil ahjedt depend-, nee on Rufiu, 0 - a
r.ew partition of it by its three powerful
neighbours, is contrary to all that has ever
y-et been contended for by the men of the
.ward on the b:,lance of power ; to foffer
At>(*na to gam any m of ter i or;
it tiie expense of France, is equally con
trary to the fame system ; .-.nd in aiding
:he views of Auilria, or conniving at th./c
i>f Russia, Prussia leems to be adting e
qually againit her own inteceft as forr.i-rlr
un.iefllood, and to be strengthening the
hands of a rival.
The probable result of these extraordi
nary comb-nations will be, either tha the
designs of the three gre;* military powers,
now apparently acting in concert, wdl be
fruflated by their mutual j-aloufiet, and
the recurrence of Prussia, to former princi- ,
pies of ast ion ; or that the pther powers
of Europe, particularly Great-Britain and
Spain who cannot f e with indifference a
ny material change in the political divifi \
of Europe, will interpose with their media
lion, and put an end to the mischievous ca
rter of ambition and bloodshed.
Aniinmenfe traift of land fituatcd in
Pcnnfyh-ania, has lately been fold by Mr.
Moi l S,' of Philadelphia, partly r, Hol
land a-rd partly in Engl., ,d. Mr. Pulten

. od to the amount of nearly too'oo 1 arâJ
it is his plan to invite settlers to" live upon
it, rent free, for five year ; f.;â- wlrt'ch term
he expedts it will be worth their while to
put it into a state of cultivation ; and th.'.t
they will afterwards be induced to make'
purchases at an a<K inccd.pnc-.-, by railing
the money on mortgag- and ctherwife,
rather than emit it.
It appear.: to have been a misftatemei.t
in the public pints', which repreffnte-d
that the States General had Signified a dis
position to join the cause of Auilria and
Prussia again ft France, and that in this
the province of Holland flood molt for
ward : on the contrary, the prevailing
politics of that province are more difaf
fefted towards the ex'.ting government
of tne state.;, tiian those of any other. '
Hence we may conclude, that tiie wish
ot"that quarter wort .I rati, -r bein favour
of the French, however, the fait seems to
be, that tlie ftadthchftr and l;b friends
have to ceftgn to concern themselves at
til Pin the affair. of France, fcnt unite in

land in awe, requires all the vigilance or
government.

The king, who knows his fate, waits
for it unmoved } but he is wretched on ac
count of his royal consort and lovely
children. His majesty was blooded on

The Dauphin's little countenance has
a great alteration too ; he was
accuflomed to run about , now the fight
of p;kts deters him from .that exercise so

WARSAW, June 9.
OUR court has demanded the mediation
die king of IVuffia and the king of Hun
gary, with the Ruffian court, in behalf of
Poland, but without effect ; both courts
having absolutely refufed to take any part
in such a^tepâon the contrary, they have
both given their advice u> she Polilh repub
lic to abandon its new constitution, and as
semble a diet for the purpose of re-adopt
ing tile old constitution, being the only
means (fay they) now left to conciliate the
J:'jrbprefs,and prevent the evils that threaten
its. We can promise ourselves noth'tng
from the court of Vienna, conlidering the
ancient connection between them and pruf
fja. Being thus left to corfelves and our
o.va flrength, depending upon the justice
of our cause, the utmost energy of the na
tion will be exerted, as our motives are
the purest that can inspire the human
bread.
BRUSSELS, June 24-
The early fuccefles of the Ailftrian arms,
put our troops in high lpirits, but within a
few days events h;>Ve confiderabiy changed,
and the tide o? fortune seems to have turn
ed in favour of the French. It was more
to the want of discipline among the French
troops than cowardice, that their misfor
tunes on the 29th and 30th of April are t<
be attributed. Sfiice subordination hr.
been established amongst [hem, and confi
dence in their generals has taken place, it i>
viiible that their manner of fighting has beei:
wholly changed. On the 17th of June a
valt body of them entered our territorie
Oil the fide of Flanders, and 011 the km
day poflefled thtmfelves of Menin and
Ypres, where were garriloned fonie Tyro
lefe chafl'eurs, who retired at their ap
proach, so that both places were gainec;
without a fiiot.
When Ankarftrom was just about to re
ceive the coup de grace after his throe Hog
gings, and after his right hand was cut otr,
he exerted all his remaining flrength, and
addressing himft If to the furronnding mul
titude, he (hid, " I now touch the minute
of deliverance, and of everUftitig reward.
I rejoice in my deedâl have rescued my
country from a tyrant by the only mean
left to slaves âX know that you will blel"-
me for the ast, anil my memory will be fa
ored in Sweden. Let your gratitude to me
be (hewn in kindnel- to my ch Idren."
The ilf-fated kingdom of Poland feenr
(leflined at all times to fate the rapacious
cruelty of its neighbours, and to experience
a depredation unprovoked by any offence.
It has fcarce'y yet recovered from the very
fyecies of oppreflion which it ex
perienced in tile year 1770, from Prufiia.
its present fa'ithlefs ally. Every town and
of Poland was at that time compel
led ta furniih a certain number of marri
ageable girls, with houleirold neceflaries,
and to each three ducats of gold as a por
tion. These wretched brides were sent to
flock the PrufTian dominions. Obliged to
abandon their parents, their country, their
friend?, and their religion, .they were trans
ported to an unknown country, married to
men whom they never saw, and doomed to
live in mutual hatred with a people, whose
language they could not underiland !
The number of Ruffians who have enter
ed the l olilh territory augments every day,
as frelh detachments are continually sent
for that ferv ice. Itiij, 110 doubt, the in
tentions of the Emppefs to overrun the
country by the numbet of her troops. The
Polilh anuy, which at prelent amounts to
ioo,ooc effective men, keep close together ;
they have flittered nothing by deferticti ;
the citizens ami soldiers all display the fame
ardour and unanimity. Patriotic gifts pour
in from every quarter.
The regent of Sweden, though he ha
declined taking an elective part in the
combination againlt France, has not yet
thought it prudent, in cijifequence of the
treaty entered iiKo between the F.mprefs
and die late king, formally to acknowledge
the French conftitutiou. The order Puii
remains not to receive the French flag/ami
the envoy of Fiance has not been yet pub
lickiy prefenttd.
PARIS, July i 7.
M. La Fayette has, by his dep 1r; nre fron:
Paris, continued the good Opinion which
the true friend ; of the constitution enter
tain of him, for though they acknowledge
the necelKty of a ftroug step, tiiey did 110:
admire the rrieafuftf of a Jeneral' ; dictating
to the legislative body. ITâ¢ s continuance
in Paris, even without followers, would
have been con.'idered as an attempt to inti
midate, from, the influence which he had
over tile naiio 1.11 guard, and therefore his
return to the army is aufpicimis to tile true
march of the co iiiitution. The Allembly
will now deliberate 011 his pfopolititlit,
without being overawed, and it is to be ho
ped that such a check will be given to the
republican societies as w ill reliore vigor and
tone to government.
The conduct of the king on the aotli
June has done more to invigorate the con
ltitution rii.m all the acts of rhe present le
giilature put together. It pronounced him
to be truly animated by the principles oi
tiie new fyitem, and sincerely anxious for
its eitabliiimient. For if he had been deii
roil., oi confirming anil making nianifelt al
the afi'ertioii . of the emigrant French, anc
of the united courts, he would have yield
ed to the torrent that alia.led himâhe
would, when called upon by an armed b 11
ditti, have granted ali that they demandec
âwithdrawn his veto ârecalled the Jacobir
nilniiters âand complied with every other
mandate. This would have been the true
political course for his majelty to have pur
l'ued, if he had wilhed to declare to ail Eu
rope that he was 110 c free, an.l that in se
cret he lighed lor the return of the ancient
urder of things.
Inltead of this he manfully supported hi;
royal dignityârefilled the unconltitntional
demandâand in thus maintaining his own
branch of the new constitution, pronoun
ced in the inoit unequivocal tone, his lovs
and respect for ttie whole.
It is so conlidered by every fenliblsfrient'
to the new constitution; and acco dinglj
declarations from all quarters are Comioc
up to the Atltmbly. The petition of the
active citizens of saris is already sighed bj
many thousands, and there is 110 doubt bui
the emigrants will be deprefi'ed as much a
the Jacobins, who have been hitherto thei!
b.*lt friends.
It would be wrontr, however, to imagine
that the truefriends of the constitution wifr
to extirpate the clubs. No such thing i:
meant. They know their obligations ti
the clubs ; they know that thry have beer
the great foui ce of national knowledge :
for in the societies, the acts of the Aflembh
were made a series of political iriltruction
beginning with the declaration of the right:
of man, and following tile course rf the na
tional proceedings, every principle was ex
plained, every decree was promulgated
and men who could not read were fount
to lillen, and learn their lbcial rights, anc
their duties. The public liund, thus gene
rally illuminated by these societies, was a
gain exprclled by the fame organâand thu
the irreliltible voice of the nation resound
ed from all parts of tile iuimenfe empire
with the velocity of an electrical explosion
In 1 ngland they would be astonished at the
rapid I'enfe of the people here on every
question, for even to this clay they have no
effectual means of making certainly knowr
ro the people of Great-Britain the statute:
by which they are to be bound. Poor illi
terate perfbn:, though they are left to
grope out their duties without light 01
guide, are not to be exctii'ed committing
any of the rrefpafles from ignorance, altho'
rt.afon could 110 c warn them on the subject.
for alnioft all the race of English revenue pe
nalties, mult be abandoned by reason. But
here it is not poiiibie for a man to be igno
rant of any law, and 10 these societies a>
much as to the means eftabiifhed by the
constitution, they are indebted for this
great good. ' To maintain these social con
nexioiu is therefore the delire of everj
man ; it is only wished that the hot and
inflammatory fpiriis "may be taught that
they shall not with impunity turn them in
.o armed corporations, and excite them to
rife up against the autnorities conltituted
oy law.
At no moment since the dccifion of the great
Ijueftiori, whether France should he an heredita
ry monarchy or a republic, has the public mind
been so convulfrd as now. The Jacoliins have
utterly, and 1 dread nally, ftifled the voice of all
conllitutional men ; and a total fulpenfion in pub
lic office has, of course, taken place. Initead of
Hemming the torrent, which the rebels on the
frontiers aie jult preparing to bear down upon
their devoted country,thole hot and intemperate
men are employed only in denunciations, in inc n
diary motions, and in febemo wf vengeance and
blood,

When the i'everal hostile nations of Indi

are even enough without them, who do it
willinglyâWhat ! could a handful of be

Extract from Mr. Paine's letter to Lord
Onflow (dated June 21) on his attempting
to influence the county of Surrey to address
tke king, and exprels their approbation of
the late proclamation to suppress fcditious
writings, &c.
" When it was reported in the Englifli
newspapers, some Ihort time since, that the
Empress of Ruflia, had given to one of her
minions a large trafl of country, and seve
ral thousand peasants as property, it very
jullly provoked indignation and abhorrence
in those who heard it. But if we compare
[ the mode praffifed in England, with that
which appears to us-fo abhorrent in Ruliia,
it wilt be found to amount to very near
the fame thing ; âfor exampleâ
" As the whole of the revenue in England
is drawn by taxes from the pockets of the
people, rhofe things called gifes and grants,
(of which kind are all pendons and sine
cure places) nre paid out of that flock.
The difference, therefore, between the
two modes is, that in England the money
is collected by the government and then
given to the pensioner, and in Ruflia he is
left to call lor it himlelf. The smallest
film which thepooreft family in a county
so near London as Surrey, can be fuppoftd
rio payaunudllf oi â¢, is not less than
five pounds ; and as your sinecure of onrf
thouland, and pension of three thonfand per
artnum, are made up of taxes paid by eight
hundred finch poor families, it comes to the
lame thing as if the eight hundred families
had been given to you, as in Ruflia, and
you had collected the money on your own
account. Were you to fay that you are not
quartered particularly on the 4 people of Sur
rey, but on the nat.on at large, the objec
tion would amount to nothing ; for as there
are more pensioners then counties, every
one may be conlidered as quartered on that
in which he lives.
What honor or happinefis yoti can derive
from being the principal pauper* of the
neighbourhood, and occasioning a greater
expence than the poor, the aged, and the

it is no wonder you should be Itrenuous in

of tliofe abuses. No wonder that you (iioulJ

Concise view of the 1110't material foreign
intelligence by the Adriana, William
Peun, .and other veflets lately arrived
from Europe at this port and New-York.
The F.leftor of Saxony has done his ut
niolt to prevent the kings of Prussia and
Austria from intermeddling in the affairs of
Poland, but without success ; a league
having been entered into between , Ruflin,
Pruflia.and Anltria,, whereby they engage
by a union of force to take poiTefiion of
Poland, form it into four partitions, three
of which to be appropriated refpeflively to
those three powers, and the fourth to be
given to hit present majesty. and after hi#
death to his nephew, under the title of an
hereditary Duchy.âThe French army hav
ing taken several places in the Austrian
Low Countries, had evacuated them and
retreated to the frontier line, where they
remained 011 the defenfive, which it was
thought would be the future complexion
of the war on the part of France.âThe
queen of Portugal had not yet received any
permanent benefit from the endeavors of
do&or Willis, but remained, as usual, very
much shattered in her intellects, and only
rational 011 particular fubjefts. âPeace had
been made between lord Cornwallis and
Tipp >0 Saib, the latter having furrendcred
one half of his territories for the preserva
tion of the other, and given his two funi
as hoilages for rhe performance of the con
ditions 011 his part. âOn the 10th of July a
rattle was fought between a body of the
Poiifh and Ruilian forces. The Latter were
obliged to retire with the loss of 1 jo men
left dead on the field On the nth there
was another engagement, in which the Po
landers were fin rounded by the Rullians,
but made a retreat by dint of their artillery, with
so r.e loss, although great numbers were slain on
the Ruffian fide by the well direfled lire of tho
artillery.âThe k : ng of England had declined
mediating with the powers on the continent
leagued against France, but protnifed for his own
part to observe the ftrifteft neutrality.âlt was
thought not improbable that the Marquis de la
Fayettr would march his forces immediately to
Paris, and that he would either there rcfign the
command, or declare himfelf, at their head, the
enemy of the late legislative proceedings : it
was thought by many that he had much too soon
declared himfelf the enemy of clubs.âlt was
said that Holland had determined to take part in
the war against Fiance, in concert with Austria
and Prufii i: the profpefl of anarchy in Paris had
induced the province of Holland to this resolu
tion, w ich it was feared by the frie ds of the
Frcnch cause would extend to the other provin
ces of the Dutch Netherlands: the defenfive
plan, however, which the French have since a
dopted, was not then known : this alteration in
the Frcnch war system may therefore prevent
the intended alliance.âThe Emprelit of RuffiÂ»
had formally discharged all Frenchmen from liejr
dominions, not looking upon her goveinnu nt-or
heiftlflafe while one of that nation remai eti ie
her territories.---A peace had been con -ded
upon between the Swedes and Algerir. by
which is secured to the Swedilb comsie
free navigation of the Mediteirar.ean.- The \
moil impartial English papers state the success of
the British arms in the Eafi Indies to have been
brilliant and decisive, but the advantages greatly
over-rated: Tippoohas indeed surrendered half
his doinininions to save the other half, but tney
are said to be generally barrep and mountainous,
and his whole yearly revenue not to excec i two
millions and an half (lcrling annujdly.- -1 ?
French emigrants at Coblence had publiflied an
appeal, in which they invite all persons of cha
racter to contribute in proportion to their fortunft

spiracy of the despotic powers, thole friends of

abroad to be predatory with taxes at home !"-â
Lord CofhV.jllis, having concluded the w#r inIndia, was, by the last account, prepurihg to
proceed to Bengal, from whence he was to em
bark for England with all poflible expedition ;
to be Succeeded in chief command by general
Abercrombie.â lnflead of India flock fifing in
London at the news of peace with Tippooj it im
mediately .ell 6 per cent. The nation had let
their hearts upon Setingapatam, and peace being
made withou this impoitant capture, bicd a Se
cret difgufi: monied men began to fee that the
principal advantage of the peace "â tin Tippoo
was the getting nd of an impolitic war: the
whole advantages were grratlv inadequate to the
expenfc; hence the fall of India flock.---The
present alpetft of Europe was thought to be such
as Â«o confound all reafoningon any of tile prin
ciples formerly admitted as axioms in politics :
" to futf-v Poland to be overrun and reduced to
a (late of the molt abject dependence on Riillia,
or a new partition of it by its three powerful
Jieighbours, is contrary to all that has ever yet
been contended for by the pen or the (word on
the balance of power; to fuller Auflria to gain
any accefuon of territory at the expence of
fiance, is equally contrary to the fame fyflem ;
and in aiding the views of Aullna, or conniving
at those of Kuliia, Prullia seems to be acting
equally againfl her cwn interefl, as formerly un
deiliood, and to be (lengthening ihe hands o' a
rival." The probable rcluh ot thole extraor
dinary combinations, it was thought, would be,
either that the deligus of the great unlit ry pow
ers, now app rently aÂ£ling in conceit, would be
frufliuted by thei mutual jealcufies, and the re
currence of Pruflia to former principles of acti
on - t or that the other powers of Eutope, prll -
culaily Great Biitainand Spain, who canno lec
wuh indifference any material Change in tlie poli
tical divilion of Euiop , would inlerpofe with
their mediation, and put an end to the mischiev
ous career of ambition and bloodflied.âOn the

A gentleman who was lately in Sliel
burne, Nova-Scotia, informs, that there
are upwards of three hundred very elegant
built houses in that place unoccupied.
Tliofe houses were cliieiiy built by the loy
alists, who left New- York in corifequence
of the impolitic measures adopted bv that
slate in the year 1783, âwhen so much
money was carried away by those persons,
under the harsh denomination of refugees,
and who would have gladly remained to
expend their money in New-York, had
they not oeen alarmed, and, in fact, forced
away. The reason alledged for so many
houses being empty at Shelburne, is, that
the climate and 10.l of Nova-Scotia is deem
ed altogether hoflile to the constitution*'of
human beings, uho were certainly never
intended, agreeably to the Hale of nature,
