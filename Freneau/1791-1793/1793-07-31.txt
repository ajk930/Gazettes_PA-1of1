Numb. 79 of Vol. ll.] WEDNESDAY, July 31, 1793.
To the Hon. the Rrprefentatives of tlie
State Â«f Pe nnfvlvania, the Remonstrance
and Petition of the Subaribers, Land
iiolders, aiul Citizens ot the laid State.
Rtjpedfully Sheivelh,
THAT they observe With gteat cn-i
----iern, a law of the Legislature p-aflVc!
at the December Scflion T791 entitled kl A'i
ast to enable the Governor of this Com
jrnwiw'ealth to incorporate a company for
opening a canal and navigable water coup
rnnnicatlon between the rivers Delaware
and Schuylkill. &c.
With r'efpeft to the general operator
ot that law, your remonflrants humblj
conceive, that the legislature entrusted b)
tlieir conflituents with the gnardianlhif
and protection of every species of public
propei ty, cannot constitutionally alienati
and traÂ» fer the private property of theii
fellow citizens, or the profits thereof, foi
the exclnfive and peculiar emolument o
anv man, or incorporate company ot mer
in tlie universe, without their previous di
rest co 'feÂ»t.
A recapitulation of some of the obferva
tions which have already been fiibmitted ti
the consideration of a diiinterefied ant
enlightened public, through tlie medium o
t!i press, may serve to, ilfuttrate the pre
ceding polition. and bring the law bad
to the reconfidtration ot the legislature
Your re-nonftrants have the misfortune o
greatly differing with some oltheir friends
for while tW.y d.'preiate the menaclnj
conduct which has been recurred *0 f"i
the unwarrantable purpose ot compelling
a facrifice of their property to tlie feififl
views of the canaj company, they <!o no
liefitate to declare their entire appro'mi
on for the public utility of artificial iniaiu
Navigation Had better proof been want
ing than such a declaration, they woulc
mod cheerfully have aided and a'iiiledlh*

the arduous work, provided the profits ac
cruing from the toll, reverted into the
public Treafutv for lightening the burther
of future taxation. Instead ot which
your remonstrants cannot but lament tin
mistaken policy of the present system,
which eftabliflics a monopoly bylaw, of
25 per cent. 011 the capital flock of the
company, at the expellee of the belt inte
rest of their fellow citizens. Little, very
little more needs be said at thi early peri
od, refpefting the pernicious tendency of
such laws in thiÂ« country, as it is well re
membered. their operation has never
farted foonet or later to create civil eom
motion, animosity amongfi itspeacea
ble citize*ns,\yhe have been recently taught
in the school of adversity, to think they
still pofl'efs the unalienable right as free
men, to defend their property agaitift the
attacks of unconstitutional authority.
The Srh Section of that law appears to
j'our remonftrants,pregnant with the abuse
of power, difgtiiied under the legal sophis
try of a writ ad quod damnum, directed
to the fherifi" of Montgomery county, (or
as the cafe may be) commanding him to
summon a pofie of twelve men, tor enqui
ring into the damageâ" the perfou or
â erfons may sustain, owning any lands or
tenements neceflary to be used by tne said
President and Managers, or which shall be
injured in eflablifhing the said canal" It
fliould feeinaimoftneedicfs here toobferve,
that ia cafe the aggrieved perfou or per
sons, will not content to dispose of their
bottom lands at 251. per acre, the price sti
pulated by the deputies of the board ol
managers, for the molt luxuriant caterer 1
meadows, the whole property demanded
by them, is then wrcfted out of their pof.
feflion, and committed to the expat tc va
luation of the fheriff and his felefted pofie,
Jvhoare charged with the proprietors right
v *if making a title in fee simple to the Preli
clent and managers of the canal company :
Nor can your remonllrants e.xpeft an\
thing but vexation and cxpence from the
remedy of an appeal as celinquent suitor:
to the judges of the supreme court aire: d'y
mulfled as they are with the costs of trial.
What have your remonfirÂ«nts done to
incur such an unexampled penalty ? Ot
are they singled out as victims lor feeling
the pulse of the whole community of free
men
Your remonfirauts, forbear any fur
ther animadversion on the baneful con
fluences of the law as it now Hands,
threatening the liberty avd property ot
every citizen in the (late, and perhaps the
very lives of some, as orderly refpetlable
people as any country can boast. As s\oe
iul experience has 100 often evinced, that
infallibility is not the chartered privilege
of Legislative bodies, your renjonftralits
beg leave to suggest, that it in ay be possi
ble, fume venat designing characters of
the canal company, may have surprised 'he
Legislature into the measure, for the
nefarious piirpofe of Speculation, by mis
representing the advantages of a naviÂ« i
b!e canal ifrom Norriftown to Philadel
phia. The novelty of that project, eÂ»rn
could it be acconrpliflied, would begear
the Hydrophobia of a Brindtv himfe'f,
who wished to make the EftgHlh "
that rivers were only created to fex.nl
canals. Your remonlfrancs haVe never
yet been informed of the navigable life or
a canal clofcly embracing the bank, acd
adhering to the meandering courses of
the river Schhylkill, already navigable SaS
far as the falls, for boats from j to j/j
tons; and might be easily improved with
one tenth part of the expence of opening
the Canal, so as to admit of an uninter
rupted navigation at all seasons of the year,
for boats of 20 tons burthen, by diverg
ing the channel In some places, from the
oppolite, to the eaflern (bore with lloue
walls; and in other places, by embank
ments of consolidated earth, with the coil
ftruftiou nf a highway on the margin ol
the river for liorfeS to tow up thfc boats ti
their rendezvous for freightage down ;
not altogether dillimilar to the treckfciiir
of Holland, from which a moderate tof,
may be collected for defraying the ere
pence, and for the use of the pwb'te funds,
With tniprefiions of a becomiirg diffi
denes in the prosecution of speculative
schemes, your remonflrants have not the
preemption to affirm the one, i-Hat thev
have now |He honor of propofrig to the
legiflatitrejts unexceptionableâBut at leafl
they flatter tnemfelves, that it has at onct
:hefuperior merit of preserving tfie invio
lability of private property, and t/ie rfgty

j?g leave to rely 011 the justice, virtue,

hall think meet; and as in duty bound
hey wijt ever pray, &c.

t FIND an opinion is endeavoured to be
*â  propagated by the advocates of ariflo
:racy in this country, that public affairs
honld only be difculled by 'â¢ men of pro
perty," or what with them is a fynoni
mous term, "reputation."
Strange, that certain infects who have
been thawed into exigence by the sunshine
of the army dues, and owe their whole
ronfequence to the cafy credulity of a de
fran-led public, (hould affurae thus mucli
over what is the birth-right of every free
American, the right of freeiy d'lciitfim'
public measures. " Forget not thuu ni l

gentlemen aristocrats, that ten or fifteen
years ago ; nay, but three or four with
r ome of you ; you would have been dif-
Sculted to make out iron dips to a taubce\
and that altho' now you may be forming
maginary alliances between chunk and
'rate, time has been when ye were nearly
allied to church-mice.
11 is impossible to defend the fyftefri of
lisfranchiling a fellow citizen because lie
s not so rich as his more favoured neigh
jour. L'jider any ftv.e of society proper
:y always lias had, and will have full as
much influence as it ought ; and it is gross
ignorance in politics to add so many arti
ficial to the natural inequalities among
men. Neither am I inclihed to believe
chat public spirit and independence is ex
dulitely confined to the rich ; so far as
my experience goes, the dire ft contrary
is the fact ; and 1 altnoft fufpeft it is a
eafyfor a lirft rate fliip's cable to pass thro'
the eye of a needle, as for a man of large
property to be a good patriot and a friend
to the liberties of the people. 1 am. nut
prepared to believe that public spirit is not
one of the virtues of the man of humble
fortune.
If want of wealth be made the criterion
of literary and other demerit in this coun
try, with what poflible face can the advo
cates of " The Defence of the American
Constitutions," (land up ar.d utter the
endless eulogies of that mighty work? Ab
flfailed from a public salary of five thou
sand dollars a year (1 mere temporary
thing) it is well known the property of
that AUTHOR (to hispraile b; it fpokej)
is little or nothing; ant! that if this or
fomelimilar lucrative station should fail
him, he must t'en handle the spade at
Braintree, or .turning out the present Edi
tor, John I'eimo, take charge of his own
Gazette in this city, to the eternal confu.-
on of the relt ofthe editorial craft.
It would be well enough that fame high
rp rited property-men should br told, that
many of those whom they are ignorantly
.'billing, and endeavouring to hold up in
the light of paupers, and therefore tinwor
thy the common rights of freemen, are
independent landholders, persons of indus
trieus habits and hone't pursuits in life,
that alk favours of no man,nor expeÂ£t any;
abhor every idea of sycophancy, and e
ally despise a knave Whether he he.

having reason to consider himfelf in the
hands of a pcrfon who paid no refpeft to

"THE influence of charaiter , 3rd grezi

even in the molt trifling circt,n..iarce?.

Reflecting kill night-on the foregoing
:ruths, I fell into a profound flcep, and
"oon after probably began to dream, the
"Ã¼bltance of which, as nearly as 1 could
recoUeft., is as follows :
I fancied myfclf a native of the planet
Venus, the inhabitants whereof were not
inly numerous but wealthy, and the conu
:ry throughout flouriflting. The placets
Mars, Mercury, and Luna, I also conceiv
ed to be inhabited and very populoas, and
:hat they all had intercourse with each
Dthrr, some by means of balloons, and
others by wings.
The inhabitants of Mars, me thought,
Â« ere rather arbitrary, and atteihWeri to
:!omincer a little over not only my coun
rjmen, but a'fo over the citizens of the
>ther planets. We however, alter a levere
fruggle amPfome hard blows, convinced
rhofe martial gentry that we were and
night to be put of the aflioH nf their sphere.
The Itruggle colt an immense treasure at'(l
:be precious lives of thotifands of our brc
.hren. Our object was obtained \frith the
inoft complete Cuccefs, aided however by
the glorious interposition x>f the benevolet E
vtizens of Mercury,ever prompt to l!retc;t
out the friendly arm of protection and re
lief to the diftrefled.
Generous nation I (methofight I heard
some one Exclaim) how much do ye yon -
selves stand now in r.ccd of th::t manly aid
which ye so lately sent others! Ho*' dil
traftrd your affairs in c< nfeqnence of the
hellish combination of the petty tyrants of
the numerous paltry empires, and little
provinces of Luna, re-inforced by the un'-
solicited, fangninary Myrmidons of Mars,
and impelled through prejudice and jea
lousy to this last act of favrge barbaiuy
againlt the citizen'- of Mercury, contending
for an object which they col lider of infi
nitely more value than life itfelf, namely,
to think ahd ait fir t/ici;:fc'vt r.
As I have already mentioned, I fancied
all intercourse between the planets to he
carried on by means of v-ing l : art! feat'otmsjÂ«fatl that a ("iftincl cUss of men, natives of |

than considered as belonging to any one
planet. Like moit men, thry were go
verned by their interest, a id that plaiiet
wj their count' )' where their interest was
most promoted.
It happened, however, that a man o
this description, a native of the planet
"Venus, being in a certain port thereof, wa
deiirous of going elsewhere, but the flay*
and rigging of Wis aw balloon being out ot

Obfcrvations on oui political and commercial
eoineSiom with France.
' <T">o judge on t >e.e important ftibjfils we
i-miit consider the peculiar lituation ol
the United States, as COUhtticd with thâ¢-
European powers.
As a commercial country, it is our inte
reft to firm a friendiy ihtercourte with
fvich nations, as are tlifpofetl to promote
the great objects of trade on the principle
of reciprocity. To effect this purpose, we
should examine the coudull a id di/pojitian
of the several powers ; and when convin
cetl of their friendfliip, we oughtto grant
favors, antl confer privileges, with the
fame degree of liberality, as they appear
inclined to act towards us. It is a good
max'ni in politics, to do to others, as they
do ti'Wurdi us ; antl in order to prevent a
coiiti m.,nee of injuries, it is incumbent on
lis to check them by a vigorous and timely
retaliation. By pursuing a conflaiit course
of defenjive operations againti such nations
as wantonly endeavor to diitrefs otir trade,
we (hall Cpeedily convince thf?m of otit
mercantile strength. and teach them the
folly of commencing a commercial war
with lis.
These oWervations being preniifed, the
qnÂ«flion is. What nation Teems molt disposed
to form connections with the Unittd State ,
fountled on the broad balis ot mtuual ad
vantages? What European power hold
out the molt favourable terms, to promote
and enlarge our commerce ? Which among
them dilplays a generous cordiality ton-arch
oil (r ivemment ain\ c'tiLtr/s â , or by legit
1 t ve acts, Ihows a flifpofitioil to harvtwi
ize and eq talize the trade and intercourfc
of both countries ? Can Americans be at
â¢a lofi to thus disposed
to overtures cf friendfhip ? the
io.Tiui -eil powers at war with France,can
Â»ne among tlicin, with propriety receive
the appellation of friends, as to their pro
ceedings towards us ? Which of them haÂ«
ver coin* forward witfi Commercial pro
pntitioiis, worthy our acceptance? Not
\ ithituuding we have rushed precipitately
into the Britifli trade, and incopfiderately
lavished among her merchants and manu
faflureri, the principal part of every pro
fitable branch of our commerce,yet we find
that the nation, far from returning even
Aecent/itteiitiun to the numerous benefit
they derive from onr Connection, treat u
with the mfit jhidied injolaice, and art
ever planning measures to embarraf; u
in every port we enter. Since their con
test with France, ha\e they not prohibitec
ur carrying, the produce of America t,
that country, even a* a neut-al ration â¢
Our vcflels and properly are now beconit
the sport of their pru ateers ; and the A
â¢nericau flag, can fcaiiely be Unfurled 01

with indecency, and exposed to infnlts.
The cooltiefs and indifference which ma
ny feern disposed to fliow towards Franct
are difficult to account for, as it rtfpirft
jotli our political and commercial iiiiertft
As a young nation, is it not of the uuiiol
impoi tame, that we secure the fi:cnd,,.r t

iffiit us, and wishes to bellow every com
me.cial benefit upon us, ought we to trev
ter favors with coldness, or appear back

Hid partiality ?
There appear? a disposition anionyjorne
'opreftr a connection with Britain, ratht
han with F-rance. It is evident that tin
the ami and delign of certain individual'
'remitter they may wijh tn conceal it- B
10 ma 1 who i a friend to, or who undei

Should Britain succeed against France, caj
we ever expert to reap any advantage
toiii the acquilition ? Miotild they reftori

ucrue to us in confequeftce of it? V\ i.
he American commerce thrive by th<
neafure, or will there be less impolition
j aftlfed on our trade ? \\ ill the Hritill
iiinillry be more cordi >1 to our welfare :
Will the legtflature of the nation becomi
nore favourable in their plans; or wil
he r acts be less injurious in their opera
ion ? Iu Ihort, not oae advantage can \v<
propose to ourselves from their fiKcefj
Hit on the contrary, every misfortune
would attend lis. If the Britifli are now si
rifo'crtt, amid their present complii ate<
jiflrelfes what may we not expert, Ihoult

jugating France ? The idea is too diitrcl!
;lg to anticipate.
Bnt let u; reverse the scene. and enquire
What may we not expect fnould France fuc

;ver been cmfpicuous. During our wai
with Britain, we experienced the falutarj
.â frect3'of her favor ible disposition. Sincc
he peace, her exertions' ave not ceased tc
illilV our trade, and cement our alliance.
There has ever appeared a noble genero

American connection ; defp sing the paltry
resentments that appeared to influence the
Britifli nation, they have treated the Ame
ricans with a lib i ality worthy the charac
ter of a magnanimous people. Since theii
concert with the European powers, they
have come forward with a philanthropy
â I 'd independence that mull aflonifh tneir
enemies, and rivet the alleclions of their all
ies. They fee m disposed to give the United
-tates all tb'e advantages of the.war ; an<
for that purpose have passed decrees tc
jrant the molt ample encouragement te
am" commerce in every part of tlieir do
minions. They ha've placed us on the
broadest basis of neutrality, by admitting
file property of all nations to be Carrie~
: n Aneritan bottoms free from capture.
The importance of the French nation in
the scale of Europe, is a weighty co.dicle
ration, why we ought to inculcate an har
mony with them. Many perfotis talk ol
France, as they would Ipeak of Nootka
Sound, Botany-Bay, or the Miami Villa
ges ; as if it was a country jitfl di/covered,
Hid of but little note in the political calen
dar. But it rises in weight and dignity
when it is considered, as one "of the moti
powerful, molt numerous, and molt Opu
lent nations in Europe. Its power is im
inenfe, when we reflect on the magnitude
as their present cor.test. Is there a nation
:hat could conteti I for so long a period
â wth the combir?d powers of Europe?
That could command such resources ;
maintain Inch armies; eqnip such navies,
and defend themselves without ihe ajjijt
ar.ee of a single ally, again!! the combina
tion ot such numerous adverfarie- ? When
we consider France thus STANDING
ALONF, in this arduous and obstinate
conflict, the ruagnanimitv, resolution and
formidablenefs of the nation,(land unparal
eled.
The strength of the nation is inconceivable,
as it respects the number of its citizens. I
if a final! matter for America to conciliate
die a.Te-Tion* of twenty-fix millions ol
people?â Shall we Uy our coldnejs and]
iuktwurmnejs, hazard the advantages to be '
obt.-. Ned from a nst'oii so rt IpcfUble, r.stc

ei; every benefit to be acquired liom at,
1' tance so reputable? Or lhall we over
look every flattering ctinfideration nierch
to pay our devoirs to the tottering crum
bling nation of Britain ?âWhen we re
r!ca on the probable advantages that
will arise to Â©ur commerce, in conlnqueiice
of retaining tlie friendfliip of France, ii
imi ft appear the highelt folly not to cement
our union. Should we by our pufillani
uotis conduct, excite their jealuufy, 01
or'feit their confidence, they might be let
0 retaliate with fame pointed lefeiitmeK
>n our condiift ; and should theypmluet
milar fyllem with Britain, we fliould be
Ixced in a very didrefling litnation.
The ref'ources of tne French nation h
mother matter, worthy of observation
t.id mull impress every person with an tx
Iteci idea of its power and riches. Tho
heyitand aione against the combined ar
uies of Europe, they are enabled without

or ail other pnrpofes;âls it poflible ti

we find they are all anlwered with the in
most rtatiinefs, and not a murmur is heard
-it fi er in the National Convention, or a
nongthe people, of the burden o! tb i:
axes.âWhile the other powers are con
Ulfed for want of refomces, France a

âVv'lien we coiifidcr the wealth of France

ave Ihaken her tothe centre, without evei
Iring a gun within her territory, if ertl;

It is derogatory to France, to draw an;

hants and m mutacturers within the If a -
me Â»l bankruptcy, and reduced her lti
niller to he pitiful state of an inflgnrficon:
paw n broker.
These are the ideas that ought to ope
rate on the minds ol Americans, when re-
Hc-aing on our conn<a on with France â
The pusillanimity we lo often observe he!',
up in our papers, may answer the purpolc

From the foregoing obfervati.-nÂ«, it i
not meant that we fnould wantonly plungi

he would not record any improper ails,

energy to our sorrow. It was the mali
cious conduct of the Britifli court whicl
prevented our trade from increasing; land
-1 d property of consequence fell; the far
mers were not duly encouraged, and the
building of shipping was at a rfand. Policy
then induced us to tranm el ourselves be
cause we were poor; touch noise was
made about the slates not fulfilling the re
quisitions of Congrcfs ; ihe truth is, they
were in general too poor to doit: but
now, that the resources of America go into
one fund, what becomes of the money i
Do we kHen the public debts? Or do we
not continually borrow from Europe ; sup
port flioals of useless ministers at exorbitant
salaries, and keep up a llanding arm),
without protefling our frontier citizens.'
The afliimption of the state debts, was a
neceflary and unavoidable measure, be
catife the federal government absorbed all
l)\e revenue ariliiig from the impofi ; but
has the msney been well hufbnmled ? (V,
(locs it not serve to make princes and na

tion iiold us in fubjeÂ£lion to foreign flock
jobbers, and thus rentier us subservient ti>
the purposes of venal European courts ?
I am firmly of opinion, that our security
from foreign ai-,d donieflic foes, depends
entirely on our republican habits, and that
the principlcsof the confederation, not the
abiorbing abyss of a monarchical form,
under the specious garb of republicanism,
will keep us free ; nor is it in the excise
fchenies of a financier, or the Prussian mi
litary plans of a secretary at war : but it is
in the virtue, the knowledge, the liberty?
and the courage of the people, under the
itate governments, that we are to look foe

Extract of a letter from a gentleman in
New-York, to his correfpundeut in this
ci; y.
" The medical profeflors of Columbia,
'"allege cannot live without (hewing enmity
0 each other. The Dean of the faculty.
Dr. S. Bard, has been severely attacked iii
liflerent newspapers, by anonymous wri
ters. There is every reason 10 suppose,
rom prefem tircumftaiices, that the medi
al fthool here will not continue much
longer in exillcnce, at lead, if it does, it
Â« ill neither be advantageous to the pupil,
or refpeftable itfel'f. Dr. Nicholas Ro
mayne has finifhed his medical lectures,
with a full determination never to lefhire
again in New-York. He has likewise
jiven up the practice of tlie Alms liouje,
as ordinary phylician; and IJr. Seaman is
appointed in his place. This will, in ray
opinion, be a considerable obstacle to the
>roiiiotion ot medical inftruitioh in this
ity, lor it is very probable it v* ill put an
utter stagnation to the lectures UCoh.mbii
because Dr. Romayne stimulated
he protifl'ors to come forward in the
nanner they have done, or else it is more
han prohibit they would have lain dor
nant time without end.
'â¢ He is a gentleman of profound know
edge and learning ; and lias discharged
he several funftionj of his profefiorfliip
ith honor and reputation.
'â¢ Di;. Romayne intends tn go to Eu
ope in a short time, there to spend the re
liairtder of tiis lite in tranquility and peace;
>y so doing, he will leave behind hisbafe
aluirtajators, who are truly emblematic
>f the dog in the manger, who would nei
her cat hinilelf or permit otners to eat."
7 he following note (said to to be an ck
ract of a letter from New-York, dated
lily 20th) was yesterday placed on the

from the person who writes the letter,

that they vary as to the name of the !>ri

ICAN S Or but regr t the ill judged
policy which induced t' e President of
the Federal government to publish an i;n
solicited declaration of the part which the
free, sovereign and independent States of
Artier! a v. ill ast in the present scene of
Lclfifh warfare and heavenly reliance.â
v Why a.nit our sympathyâour warm at
tachment to the generous friends who
fought for us, and who now have to face
tile 1 tyrants of Europe, only because they
v.'idi to b free after our example, be
1,1 tinted ? Why mud the.pacific (iifpoli
tjops of the republicans of America, be
qvteltioned by a proclamation calculated to
imprt fs an opinion 011 t e minds of distant
nations, that we are ungovernable, sivag e
people, rot to be held in awe or fuljec
t?o'h, without fomethng like Frederick's
ifiandatc? and why mull the dignity, the
liberties and he commer e of the United
Sta .es, be fpo:ted away to please the des
pots of Europe, and insult the friendly de
meanor 'four brave allies ? What have we
gafned by this pompous display cf uncon
stitutional, impetial authority ? N.tional
inpignities from the very people (the Eng
lilh) for whom the proclamation was
chi fly intended ; our flag is insulted ;
<*Â» comm(tÂ« diUreffed, and our revenue
undermined : for f our trade fuffers, our
impost will decrease. But, fay the pro
clam tioniles, the revenue is eolledh-d
Lorn the importations of British goods;
this is partly true, and partly falfe ; but
without making minute calculations, it
may be obf rved, that unless we can carry
our own pridrce to maiket, unmolefttd,
our imp;>!> wll avail us but little, iinee
without disposing of our good?, how are
we to pay for British articles ? The Bri
tish cruizers, by cbflrufting our com
merce. injure us in the moll sensible man
ner; while they deluge us with inunda
tions of their merchandize,they will hardly
fnfTer us to can y a ba: rcl of flour to mar
ket, without wreaking their envenomed
Vengeance on our helpless vcfTtrls âIt is
truly enigmatical,"tha while a proclama
tion dfclaies, that the people of America
are dead to every sentiment of gratitude
âthat they a'e entirely indifferent and un
inlerefied in the great druggie between
defpotic/io'ttw and republican liberty â
that wtl cold hearts, we will fee our
c'tily friends cut down, violate treaties,
and proflrate our rights, our glory, at the
footilool cf the Bri ifh throneâthat
throne, which once deluge ! our country
in blood 1 - I fay, wh'te the fame procla
mation, or edit"*, iicprtffcs such ideas, the
pic-pie of America, pr.d tLc citizens <f
I'ranee among us, appear to have but one
wish ! They walk together, they fit to
gather, and they celebrate the political
birth-days of the two countries, with one
foul. No anniversary since the e'ablifh
ment of our independence has been kept
!ike the loft. The fourth of July, 1776,
while it gl (Mens every honed ; eart, wil
receive additional eclat, from the four
teenth of July, 1 789, âIt is to be hoped,
when the representatives of the people of
America have convened, they will speak
the lentiments of their conftituentsâlf to
iileafe those in high Rations, they betray
he liberties and happiness of the free
â¢epublican3 who elefled them, may they
1 ver more enjoy the confidence of free
Tien I But why should I ha/. -. rd a doubt

: ara&er of the F ench, liave not at t!ii'
I 'l e, maJe a good choic of their kind cl

fiat the English fjilors, who were prifo

A'ith their men.
As the public conduit in France is 0-

ions having been dispelled by the light oi
that t-kunder which laid open to the view
jf mankind the dungeons of that inferna
prison, the Baflile, any person ie at liberty
to goion board the frigate Ambuscade.
now in this harbour, at any hour of the
lay, and consult either t> c prisoners, o:
the records of the daily expences, and he
will be convinced, that they arc treated
uft as the French sailors are. The cap
tuns of merchantmen, agreeably to the
national order eat at the matter's table ;
and both the captains and men participate
n the exiiao' dinary allowance of rum and
wine diftrihuted on certain occasions ; on
: 'ie 14th ot Julv the prisoners had, ss the
French, a double ation. Without divel
inÂ£ longer upon calumnies at the naming
whereof every one that is acquainted with
the French chared r will fhn g uptheh
shoulders, I flinll only repeat, that he who
doubts what I h -ve here affer ed, may, by
,oing on board be cafily able to ascertain
the truth thereof.
On the other hand, let him cnl' on the
French conftil, and he \vi 1 be fiiown pic
tures of a very different natureâl (hall
trouble you with the ou lines of one only :
A French officer, a young citizen, with
1 heart replete with candour, late'y arrived
From Halifax, where he (us been detained
1 p'ifoner, declires, that he was 40 days
jn board the English frigate Alligator,
'vas every night put in irons, was, in the
Jay time, compelled, by blows, to work,
;nd was at !a!l reduced to a ration of ten
mnces of br"ead per day.
Many of you, citizens of America, can
ealize a lively colour of this fort of treat
ment, by a recollection of what you have
ormerly fufTered in a similar fit jatLon, fr.im
the lame Anient, generous and humane nation.
I cannot avoid obferring, that it would
ie prudent for Engliihmen or their adlie
ents, when they intend to attack the
French chara&er, in the presence of Am:-
icans especially those who live in the city
Df New-Yoik, to fiitin, with the moil at
tentive care, the word HUMANITY,
rom an apprehension that they might be
equefted to recolledt the total suppression
if that divine virtue towards their coun
:rvinen in the ship Jersey, and the various
prisons of this city, for a time fufficiently
long to carry thousands of martyrs in the
:aufe of freedom, to an untimely grave.
The English apologills ought to leave to
their great grand children the talk
of extolling that nation in a country, whole
v.- unds, received through her mercenaries
a "d hirelings, will not be perfectly closed
for a certs: y to come.
It is not difficult to dilcover the motive
for railing the bale calumny refpedting the
prisoners in the Ambuscade. ' 'i here are
people in this country who belong to no
nation, who are bed pleased in the rnidft
oj discord ; and having been accustomed to
look upon men a: Leads, a:;:ufe tLcjnfelves
in endcavoii-ing to ralfe one nit'on agnlnf!
anotner. J .iey wifn to raise tne paflions
of the foreign sailors, and prov .ke the n
to r. c:proc:;l infuks, with a view of giving
trouble to t!;e friends of peace, and of dif
ilurbing the police of tlii city.âThis pro
ject i-j not concurrent with the principles
of humanity ; (-hi if i 3 to bi hoped, that
they will be foui d out, and when known,
that their ingratitude and malevole ce will
he permitted to pass without any punish
