To the Independent American Electors.
AS we have for a loliff while been di
. verted with pompous paragaphs
in certain papers, relpedting the admini
ilration of our government, it is pioper
â¢i'<~ tins period, wlien a choice of Federal
'"Kepx It ntatives is to take place, for "The
a '.â¢otde' to examine for thcmfelves, and
enquire, whether the great purpofee of
our Federal Government, have hitherto
been properly attended to ; and whether
the tit zens at laigc have lb much reason
to applaud the measures adopted.
A writer in Fenno't paper, again(l Mr
7 t jF cr JÂ°"> fignid, "An i inerjean," ailerts
ii us a fait, that that Officer arraigns
the principal meafvrts of governmentâand
that he takes no pain t to Conceal itâThe re
jiuta i.n of Mr. jf jferjon, in too well
known to need any panegyric, he having
filled with honor, the inolt important
pubh< ollices both at home and abroad.
Ai d as a further proof of his known at
tachment to the Interest of his country,
he is now, by the appointment of the Pie
/ident, at the "head" of one of the princi
pal departments in the government.
This being the cafe, notwiihllanding
an anonymous writer may attempt to in
jure hid reputation, yet when inch a cha
racter arraigrrtthe ''principal measures of
the government, and takes no pains to con
ceo I it," the jealotify of the people is na
ture Ily <xci'ed, endthev arc led ill confe
qiunce thereof; to invelligate more mi
nutely the conduct oi their rulers.
Whethei Mr .JeJfetfm is right it) his
cenlutes i n men and mealim a, does not
altogether depend on opinion, but on reali
ty â¢. Or, as the author alluded to expref
fes himfelf, "Faits fpeaklouder than 'words.'
The happinefg and profpefity of this coun
try, do not conliit in frothy declamation,
Or in the number of pompous paragraphs
exhibited in Fenno's Gazette of the Uni
ted Nutrs, and retailed out by Rujfell's
Columbian Centinel : Buttle uraiiu en
quiry is,whether the government is admin
ilfered upon those principles which were
contemplated ut the time of i s adoption.
The fu! jeÂ£t upou this extensive scale, will
be candidly con lid red.
The einbai raflments under which our
COMMEKCE labors, wasonegreat cause,
alid aimed the principal, w< ich 1 d to the
adoption of our present governmentsâ
The debates in the fevrial conventions,
evidently show, that this was an object,
among all the federal members, of the '
highell tnagHitude. At that time many
foreign ports were fluit aga nit us Fac
tors wen flocking from Europe, to relide
among us, and our navigation w.it tmbar
rafTecl by foreign rell ridtions.
Thelc difficulties were early taken into
serious conlideration t.y the merchants,
t<adefmen an I other citizens of the town
JVillon, and circnl <r letters were for
icd by a very refpett ble Committee,
.icflly calling on the frveral St.ite JLe
atures, to empower CongrelÃ tÂ» re
>,ve tll<-m âThese iepielcut.ition:i \vi le
attended to, and â > convention from
ffeveral ilates was speedily held for the
purpofeot regulating our commerce, and
cxtmding the American navigation. The
measures then contemplated without a
more minute detail, may be considered as
the bafts of our Federal Government.
A few quell ions now naturally arise,
Have the evils then complained of been re
mcdicd ? Have any cfTedtual measures
been taken to revive our commercc, or
extend our navigation ?â Has that com
mercial war taken place, which was neces
sary to promote ourcarrying trade, or
those measures of retaliation been adopt
ed, to open to us foreign ports, in order
that the navigation of this country, might

Ihe celebrated Solon introduced tliig

7'HEIR majesties,- the emperor and
king of Prussia, having confided to me
the command of the combined armies

on the frontiers of Ftance ; I have resol
ved to announce to the inhabitants of that
kingdom, the motives that have induced
tliele two fovercigns to this flep, and the
principles by which they are governed
therein.
After having arbitrarily suppressed the
fights and pretenlions of the German prin
ces in Alsace and Lorraine, and overset a!]
interior order and good government, ex
ercised agninfl the facrtJ person of the
and his august family innumerable
njuries and violences, continued from day
'to"*"3ay, and roiiftantly renewed, thofc
who have us. r d the reins of govern
ment haw, at length, filled up the inen

of the possessions of the Germanick empire
have\ been involved in this invasion, and
others have efcapei', only by fubuiittwg to
the imperious menaces of the predomina
ting faction, and of its eauflaiies.
His majesty the kin/; of Prussia, united
with his Imperial majesty, by the ties of a
ftri& and defenfive alliance, at well as ir
his quality of preponderating member oi
the Germanick body, has not been abk
to refufe marching to the succour of liu
ally, and co-estates ; and it is in both theli
qualities, that he takes upon hlralelf the
defence of that monarch and of Gev
many.
To these two interests is united anothei
equally important, and which the two fo
verrigns have much at heartâthat of cau
sing the anarchy exilling in the interior of
France to cease to stay the aflauln mafic
ui>on the throne and the aitar ; to re-ef
taolifh the legal authority ; to restore to
the king the liberty and fafety of which
he has been deprived; and to place him in
a firuntion to exercite tl* legitimate au

his majesty the emperor, and his majesty
the king of Prussia, call upon and invitt
them to return without delay to the pithi
of reason, of juftiee, of order, and ol
peace. With these views the uader lign
ed general and commander in chief of the
two armies declares as follows :
1 ft. That, led into this war by irrefifti
ble motives, the two courts propose tc
themselves no other object than the good
of France, without intending to enrich
themfelvei by means of their conquests.
2d. That they do not intend to inter
meddle in the interior affairs of France,
but mean only to deliver the king, the
queen, and the royal family from their
captivity, and to procure to his mod
chriftitn majesty the necessary security
that the king may be enabled without
danger or obstacle to call together such
convocation or assembly as he may think
proper, to affilt in prefcrving that happi
sefs to his fubjefts, which he has promi
sed to them, and to which he will contri
bute all that may depend upon him.
3d. The combined armies will protiiS
all cities, burghs, vil ages, persons and
pofl-ffions, that (hall submit to the king,
and they will instantaneously contribute
to the reftorirtg of order, and a good po
lice throughout all France.
4th The national guards are called
upon provisionally, to watch over the tran
quility of th; country, to the fafety ol
the persons and effects of all French citi
jsens, until the arrival of the troops of their
imperial and royal majesties, or until it
shall beotherways ordered, upon pain ol
being petfonally rcfponftble. On the
other hand, such of the national guards as
shall have fought aga r.ft the troops of the
allied courts, and shall be taken arms in
hand- shall be treated as enemies, and pu
nifhed as rehelrto their king and dillur

to submit to the king their lawful

6lh. That the members of the depart

held equally responsible on their heads, and
with all thtir goods and chattels for all
crimes, fires, murders or atrocious acts,
that they may not have used fill their en
deavour* to prevent within their jurisdic

to continue their functions until his moll

berty to provide ultimately, or at lead
[ until in his name other steps shall be taken
in the interval.
7th. The inhabitants of all cities, bo

shall be taken to provide for the security
of all and each one of them.
Â£th. The city of Paris and all its i'tiha
bitants without diftin&ion, are held tc
submit immediately, and without delay, tc
the king ; to set die king at full and en
tire liberty ; and to assure to him, as well
aÂ« to th; toitul family, that inviolability
and refpeft which fubjeÂ£ls owe to theit
sovereign by all the laws of nature ar.d ol

jetties render personally responsible of all

a summery military way, without the leaf!

guard of Paris, justices of the peace, and
all others to whom it may belong Theil
f*id majeflics declaring, on the faith and
jvord of an emperor and a king, that il
the castle of the Thuilleries is either for
<:ed or insulted ; that if the least violencf
âthe least outrage be offered to hia ma
jefty, the queen, or the royal fami!y-Â»-i
immediate measures be not taken for theii
fafety, tbe'r preservation and their liberty
that they will take an exemplary and evei
memorable vengeance by delivering ovei
'he city of Pari* to miliiary execution anc
a total subversion, while the guilty revolt
ers are receiving the punishment they wil
have merited.
Their imperial and royal majesties, or
the contrary, promi e to the inhabitant:
of the city of Paris, tfiat they will us:
their good office* with his mofl chriftiar
majesty, to obtain pardon of all wrongi
and errora that may hare been hcretofon
done, and to take the most vigorous mea
fin es to tnfure their persons and effetts, i:
they immediately and* exattly obey thf
present injun&ion. s
Finally their majefl'es being unable tc
acknowledge any laws as existing in Franc<
except such as shall emanate from ths
king, enjoying a perfect liberty, the)
protest beforehand against the authentic!
ty of any declarations which may be mad<
in the name of his most christian majesty
as long as hit fafcred person, that of the
queen, and the royal family shall not bt
really in fafety ; in consequence, their im
perial and royal majesties invite and car
neftly solicit his most christian majesty tc
name a city in his kingdom the most neai
to the frontiers into which he may b<
pleased to retire with his queen and fami
ly, under a ftror.g and fuEScient escort
which flail be sent for that purpose, in
order that his rpoft chrifthn majesty may
call together the ministers and councillors
he may think proper, or colledt such
convocation or afFembly as may appear
belt to him to provide for the refloration
of good order by the regu'ar interior ad
minillration of his kingdom.
In a word, I do further declaie and en
gage mylelfin my own name, and in my
quality above mentioned to occasion to be
every where observed by the troops en
trusted to my command a good and exaÂ£t
discipline, promising 10 treat with mild
ness :md moderation all well d
ful-jefts that may appear peaceable and
fubmiflive, and to apply force only against
such as (hall be guilty of resistance or ii!
will.
It is for these renfons that 1 require and
exhort all inhabitants of the kingdom in
the strongest and moll earned manner, not
to oppose the march and operations of
the troops that I command, but rather to
allow them free patlage, and all such good
will and affillance a* citcumflances may
require.

PHILADELPHIA.
September 19, 1792.
On Saturday evening last arrived here,
from Offend, the (hip Baring, capt. Tin
?;ey. ThisvefTel brings European accounts
Sown to the 3d of August. It was said at
Dftend, at the time capt. Tingey left that
port, that business in Paris was entirely at a
(land : all the (hops and flores were shut,
and upwards of two hundred thousand ci
tizens of the city of Paris were under arms,
determined to defend themselves and their
liberties to the last extremity. Every.de
partment was furnifhed in the best man
ner with cannon, military (fores, and pro
vilion. No particular accounts are received
relative to the marquis de la Fayette fur
ther than that lie was at the head of the
army on the frontiers.
ExtraÃ of a letterfrom Bojlon, dated Sept. j.
" The administration of the federal go
vernment has not been so universally pleas
ing to the great body of the people, as its
interelted partizans have continually repre
sented it to be. Its influence has invaria
bly acted as an opiate on all free enquiry
into the latent springs of its motions, and
the press has been silenced on that head,
wh le the moss fiilfome panegyrics have is
sued from the polluted font of adulation,
in its praise } in a word, the language has
b;en exhausted in terms of the bafefl servi
lity to decorate this political bride. It haÂ»
long been the opinion of many that a free
examination ot the meaiures of govern
ment will have a tendency to preserve the
conltitution of our country from change,
and ensure an adnvniftration of it upon the
fame principles that gave it exigence ; but
this only can be accoinplifhed through the
medium of a press unihackled byitrinflu
ence, and conduced to that end!"
Notwithstanding the continual puffs in
the l.nglifh papers of the enviable and un
rivalled situation of Great-Britain, and the
deprefl'ed Hate of France, it is remarkable
that every ship, from Britain and Ireland
is pouring in upon us hods of emigrants,
while those continually arriving front
France bring us few or none ; a decisive ar
gument that the common people at large
are much more at their ease in France than
in Britain and Ireland.
By a public communication from gover
nor Telfair to the repfefentatives in Con
gress of the slate of Georgia, it appears
that it will require one million of dollars to
be af'umed on account of that slate, to co
ver its Hate debts.
It is a fact, perhaps not generally known,
that the late captain John Paul joties, at
the time that he was attempting to fit out a
Uttle squadron during the late war, in one
of theyorts of France, to cruise on the coast
of England, was much delayed by neglecls
and disappointments from the court, th it
had nearly fruflrated his plans. dunce
one day threw into his hands an old alma
nac contain.ng Pear Richard's Maxims, by Dr.
Franklin. In that curious afl'eiiiblage of
ufeful inflrttftion a man is advised " if he
wish *s to have any bu fin eft faithfully and
?xpeditiouf!y performed,to go o.i it himfelf:
otherwise, to iend."âJones was immedi
ately (truck, upon reading this maxim, with
the impropriety of his pail conduct in only
Ending letters and meflages to court, when
ie ought to have gone in person. lie in
[tantly set out, and by dint of personal re
presentations procured the immediate e-
of the squadron, which after
wards spread terror along the eastern coast
of England, and with which lie so glorious
ly captured the Serapis a;id other British
(hips of war, returning from the Baltic.
Ingratitude to Dr. Franklin's maxim, he
named the principal ;hip of his squadron
after the name of the pretended Almanac
Maker, Le Bon Homme Richard, Father Rich

" It gives us great pleasure (fays a Bos
ton paper) to find that the patriotic Jef
ferson has becomc the object of ceniure,
as it will have a happy tendency to open
the eyes of the people, to fee the llrides of
certain men in power, who are wishing to
turn every Haunch republican out of office,
who has di cernmg to lsen their arbitrary
measures, and houefty fuflicient to reveal
them.
From several symptoms it appears that
the old republican spirit of America is re
turning in full force upon thoje parts of the
United States where it had been rather ob
scured for some time part by the art> of a
rifiocradcal fophiflry. How the "Gazette
of theUnitexl States" will be affected by this
change, a ffTort time will determine Some

" England at present (fays a letter from
that quarter) is free from invasion or
threat, but disturbed with internal com
motions. It may seem strange to tell, but
Paine's Rights of Man have produced all
this. A proclamation to suppress that
work, and other means also have been tri
ed : but proclamations and prosecutions
will only tend to haflen the dilfolution of
those political trammels, that have held
mankind in a bondage of thought and ac
tion too long. Mr. Paine's profecutiot) is
on the eve of commencing; and I believe
its process will be short. There is an
parent disposition in ministry to be feverjÃ
but under that veil, I guess I may venttM
to fay, there is a real inclination to
contrary; for the friends of that woifl
compose a very refpeftable majority of till
people of England. It is to the
of the court he is a fore scourge ; and the
people begin to fee the gross impofitioni that
have been praftiled upon them, and with
refentinent. It is now re
ported. that a change in the ministry to
take place immediately. The particulars
of the ins and outs are not publicly known.
The lord chancellor has lately resigned.
I his, of itfelf, will produce some change."
" Forhiately (fays the fame letter, dated
July 18) a union of parties has taken place
in France, that lefferib the hopes of her ene
mies and gives encouragement to her
friends; the want of which union has hi
therto kept alive the torch of civil discord,
and spirited up her fugitive miscreants to
excite the aid of German and Pruflian mer
cenaries; to complete the deftruflion of her
fabric. But scarcely has the m.nd time to
rsileft at large upon her fituat:on, beforePoland claims our thoughts: Emerging,

Tlie celebrated Lulvara at the instance of
the English African company, for exploring
that continent, firlt undertook the Hercu
lean talk, but unfortunately died of a fever
loon after his arrival at Cairo, in Egypt.
To him succeeded Major Houghton, who has
now for more than two years been actually
engaged in travelling through the interior
of that hitherto unknown continent. Ac
cording to English pspers, the President of
tlie African company ha. recently received
dispatches from Major Houghton, inform
ing that he lias discovered a city not men_
tioned in any hiltory, and unheard of thro
the medium of tradition. He represents it
as infinitely larger, and as containing more
inhabitants than any other cjty at present
cxiftinp in the world, bur the people even
there, as well aSin every othef part oi the
:ountry, he describes to be in a fiate of
Jkrrnfs barbarism, and trading chiefly in
Slaves, of which it is the great mart.
" From the best infortnation that can be
had (fays a tetter from Havre) France will
have to cope with an armv of at lead two

The well-withers to France and her re

Towards the latter end of .stay hit t; r
ministers of the two courts of Hungary an:

the affairs of France requiring the accef

nister's answer to this memorial is datec
June iff, wherein ne informs the above
jrlentioned ministers, that his mijefty, the
king of Denmark, cannot agree to become
a member of the concert, from the conside
ration that Denmark had already acknow

was avowed by Louis XV I, and that there
fore there could be no reason for pretend
ing to avenge the cause of him who believes
liimfelf free and fatisfied with the limita
tions of royal authority, which he had a
dopted and received without complaint-
Another cause of reftifal are the commer

iii/ringed, by Denmark making herlelf 2
party in the combination againli France.

'The few who were employed among them

DEMOCRITUS.
Bucks County, Sept. 8, 1792.
To the Editor of the National Gazette*'
THERE being good reason to suppose a
fecutiqn will be instituted again II the printer of
the Gazette of the United States for certain defa
matory charges in some ol his la e papers, it,
would be peifcfl trifling in you to take any rio
lice of the accusations* bioughtby Catulus (proba
bly the fame with 7he American) as far a they
lefpefct vourfetf. The charge of being penfion
e'd by the Secretary of State you have solemnly
denied, and theaccufatiori is as fa> as ever fiom
being piovtd, the long talked of dotumcnts be
ing yet unproductd. Diteft charges of this na
tare ought to be proved in the nioft direfcl and posi
tive manner : certainly they are not proved to
:he fatisfafction of the pub'ic by vague infinuati
f>ns, dark farmifes, inconclusive deductions, or
even by "pre umptive fails and clrcumliances."
As the Kational Gazctie has ever profi dcd
iifelfopcntoall partiesand influenced t>v none,
it will lie upon the calumniator of Mr. Jeff-rlcm's
political charatlei to prove that the National Ga
zette ha been partial to one fide ol the quellion
by re filling or nip letting original communicati
ons from the other. If 'his cannot be done,
what grounds aie rhere for furpol,r>, the Editor
to be bribed or penlfoned by the Secretary of
State? Bribing, or pensioning a man to print an
in.partial, free paper 15 (co ablurd an idea to hava
the lcalt weight with a rat ousl mind.

yet having found our whole country
convinced, and attached to its present form o
government, inltead of refpeding the will of a na
tion, they still support the ambitious fchemfcs of ;
few tyrannical minds, they insult the intention
of the Emprels, expressly announced in her dec
laration, and viola'e the public as well as the in
dividual freedom of the nation. The Ruffiar
commanders issue orders and fuirmonfes for thi
citizens to meet and join them, threatening
with the molt rigorous p-ioJecutions on persons
and property ; itiil no honest citizen has yet ap
