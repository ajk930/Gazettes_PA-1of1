Mr. Freneau,
A Correspondent requests you to
insert the inclosed from the Independent
Gazetteer, of Sept. 15. â
To the Philadelphia Sccicty for the Promo
tion of Agriculture and domcjlic Manufac
tured
Gentlemen,
HAVING cultivated Fi.ax with con
siderable profit and advantage, I
\vilh to recommend it as an ohjeft merit
ing greater attention from our Farmers,
r The use of flax is as nocefl'iry in our
cloathing, as wheat in our nounihmentâ
cmr foil and climate are as well adapted
to raise the one as the other. Why then
should we remain under obligations tod ilia nt
foreign nations for this valuable article ?
It is fuggelted that it is cheape. - to pur
chafe imported linen than to raise flax,
and manufacture for ourselves. I always
entertained doubts of the truth of this opi
nion, and am now convinced from the
experience of fcveral yeais that it is totally
without foundation.
Some good husbandmen object to flax,
because they fay tt exhaufls the Â£ oil more
than any other crop : I have not found j
this to be the cafe; during the lail sum
mer I cultivated flux and potatoes ia the
fame field ; each crop had an equal quan
tity of manure; on gat hering an excellent
crop of flax in July, the ground was irri
mediately plowed, and sowed with turnip-;
produce, one hundred bushels of good tur
Dips per acre ; on removing the crops of
potatoes and turnips, about the middle ofj
October, the g-ound was put into wheat :
the wheat on the fl ix and turnip ground
thts-bsrreftnvas fuUyeqiial, if not superior,
to the wheat on the potatoe ground.
Another objection to flax is, that it is
a very uncertain crop : on good ground,
under proper cultivation, no'crop will bet
ter anfwtr the expectation of the farmer.
Flax will grow and flower on anv foil, but
it requires a rich loam or clay to bring it
to perfection for the use of the farmer
The liilh, who for many years have had
gre-.t experience in the cultivation of this
valuable plant,generally railed it in ground
manured and planted with potatoes the
preceding year. They sow on such ground
three and four bushels of the bell Riga or
American feed to the acre. May not the
fintnefs ofthelriih flax be owing to this
thick towing, rather than to their flax be
ing pulled btfoie it is ripe ? It is said the
Flemings never pull the flax intended for
their fin cambrics and linen until the feed
is ripe. - The quality of the flax may aifo
depend very much on thefutare operations
of rotting, breaking, and hackling.
In America, flax is for the mod part
rotted, by being laid thin on a graf3 field :
The time required in this operation de
pends on t>>e drynefs or wetness, heat or
cold of the season : Flax is judged to be
fnfficiently grafled when its bark is a little
blistered towards the extremity of the
plant, and when it parts easily from the
reed, which at this time becomes very
brittle: but no written description car
pofiibly convey a knowledge of this point
at all equal to that wl ieh is acquired by
experience. I have exposed flax in tht
months of August, September, and OISO
ber, and ha e aiwayi found that it rottec
in August the best ; and am informed, by
of experience, that the injury
the flax is said to receive by the
heat of the midsummer fun, is by no means
equal to the benefit it receives by being
quickly maturated.
When the flax is exposed in a variety
of weather in a cold season, the putrefac
tion necessary to loosen and destroy the
cohesion of the fibres of the flax from the
reed, is so tedious as frequently to injure
the fibres themselves. Mills have been
ercfted for breaking ivf flax, but. the fuc
.cifs attending them hath never warranted
their g< neral use - ; recourse is flill had to
the Dutch hard-brake. I have seen n foot

machine for swingling or scutching, by
which one man can scutch fifty weight
per day : this is double the quantity that
can be performed by one perfo by hand in
the fame time. The labour and expence
of dressing flax lVwithout doubt the great
est objection to its cultivation j but in
these po nts Europeans have no advantage
over us, as they, in every initance, are fub
jeft to the fame difficulties.
Flax is certainly one of those neceflary
articles which we should cultivate in fuf
ficient quantity to enable us to supply our
selves with every kind of linen, because our
country is as well calculated for it as any
other. Whatever other nations, on ac
count of climate or situation, can raiieand
fell cheaper than we can do, and are wil
ling to exchange for the pioduce of our
farms, or indnftry, let us import from
abroad. This is the basis oijujlpolicy, true
economy, and genuine liberty.

Mr. Fevno,
I REQUEST you to inform the " Ci.
tizen of Philadelphia," through youi
Gazette, that he has made some very ma
terial errors and misrepresentations, in his
statement, which appeared in your paper
of the loth of Odtober.
To the duty on spirits distilled within
the United States he objeAs, because the
nature of its co!leÂ£h'on requires an autho
rity in the excise officer, to enter the do
mains of every individual ; to infpeft his
private btitfnefa -and cr.nccrns, and even
search his molt retired apartments, bed
rooms and closets. âNow, fir, as we natu
rally look for the extent of that authority
in the a& of Congress, let the " Citizen
of Philadelphia" point out the fpeeiah
clause of the adl where this extensive pow
er is givenâand if he is well minded, let
him also rectir to the provisions that have
been made against the abuse of any official
power.
The " Citizen of Philadelphia," has
been told, as he informs us, the colleflion
of the excise coils at present about 12
per cent. lam told that according to
positive regulations, it cannot exceed 7|
per cent. I have also been informed,
there is a profpeift that the proceeds of
this branch of the national revenue, if it
shall go fairly into operation, will amount
to more than has been calculated upon,
and that of course it will fully answer the
end for which it was intended. It appears
then that our Citizen and myfclf, are as vet
equally in the datk with regard to this
tax. Would it therefore not be prudent
to submit the iflue of it to a fair trial ?
The " Citizen of Philadelphia" will
permit me to take notice of another mifre
presentation he has made. In his plain
(latement of fact , which he offers in the
face of all the world, and challenges every
body to controv:rt, he aflVrts, that the
public faith was pledged in the moll solemn
manner, to the original public creditors.
Does he not know that the securities of
the United States were made payable to
Ihe fit ft holder, or his aflignee ? And for
what reason ? Undoubtedly to enable the
proprietor to make uie of his property, by
felling it for what it would fetch ; and
that the purchaser might at the fame time
be fafe in his bargain. Thus the public
faith was no more pledged to the firft hold
er, but to his affignec. And can it now in
juilice be violated ?âlt was altogether
upon this principle lhat Congress proceed
ed in the funding system ; and wkoevei
has attended to the debates of Congress on
thedifcrimination businessâwhoever is nol
actuated by sinister views, mud be fully
convinced, that in rejecting all djferimina
t on, Congress acted upon the broad bafn
of public justice, as becomes Â» nations'
legiflaturc.
Hence the idea is insulting to common
seise, that the Original creditors should he
ch.vged with the certificates they iiave re
ceived, at a lout 2J6 in. the poundj and the
balance paid in good money. How is it

Paris, Aug. 13.
Future times, dilinterefted in the con
mlfive movements of the prefect day, and
entertaining a temperate sense of liberty,
-viij no doubt be curious to examine by
what gradations Inch a natron' as France
Ranged her system of despotism for the
upremacy of laws. It may be said that
['"ranee has become free without fighting
or liberty : (lie has vindicated herfelf into
jeace and tranquility, after having utter
y destroyed the tyrannical inftitu' 1 ins that
lad preva led for more than 800 years.
iVhat a profpeft does she exhibit to the
lefpots of the universe ! Her example will
nfallibly work a reformation in the po'i
ics of every nation on the globe, and;
jlace the French at the head of the bene
attors of the humankind.
The PrulTian nation, for a century part,
las been little better than a compadt ar
ny. No other power has had an equal
weight, in the political balance of Europe,
vith great guns and bayonets. Pruflla has
.-ompelled all other powers to copy her ex
imple and to keep up well disciplined ar
nies. Through her me->ns Europe, even
n times of peace, has been overrun with
oldiers ; and it is principally owing :o
hem that France has, in a manner, loft
he character of a butchering nation, be
ng fupplantcd by these traders in human
jlood.
The son of lord Chatham (Mr. Pitt)
s the mortal enemy of France. He had a
land in fomenting our early divisions; and
.here is not a doub[ that he has been an
iftive inftrumeut in endeavouring to de
:ach our Weit-India colonies. He and
'lis friends have alio tried to al enaie the
iffe&ions of Spain, and break the alliance
between 11s. His plans were so well la d,
that at one time we were upon the point
us abandoning Spain forever In short,
the war we arc ,ow engaged in, maybe
imputed to the English, anj the
only, their government, and tiieir emissa
ries. A French alliance with England is
a political monster. She is, and always
has been our rival j and did we not Hand
in the way, (lie would be absolute mistress
of the sea. Abftra&ed from us, (he is the
enly rich and industrious nation, the only
one eil ghtened and free Hiitory is full
of her quarrels with Franee, and if Hie he
fitates a moment to attack us, it is only
to defer it to a more favorable time, when
she can do it with less danger to her

The effetfts of the revolution upon the
manners of Franceâlt has been observed
that it was scarcely worth while to make
a wife conllitution for such a people as the
French. That levity, which has always
liiigraced the national charaftc, if was
thought, would soon dedroy the mod pro
miling- hopes. The t uth is, the French
pian was always light and tnS'ng, because
hayipg nothing to do with affairs of le {il
lation, the natural animation of his foul
was compelled to evaporate in the imper
tinent fal'lies of imagination, chit-chat with'
women, and romantic extravagance. But
this was all for want of the solid food of
rhe mind. Frivolity will now vauifh be

in order 10 pais over 10 England.; but wuh
moie probability of truth, that tinder the pre
lice of opening the gates of Sedan to the earn- :

vemeen of his eiat majors, among whom were
M. Altxandcy.Lanieth, M. Beauhamois, and
M. Gouvion, the brother "6f the general that
fell To gloriously, took the opportunity o!
throwing themselves into the hands ot one of
the advanced pofls of the eneiriy, and by which
they were made prisoners of war. There cer

which inftigatt'd every one to hunt him down.

apartments in the palace. There was another

The dellitution of M. Luckner, and M.

think his power somewhat independent ot the

The king and queen continue in thea

conliderable lhare of the public attention-
Ttleir security is accordingly to be further
provided for by the erection of a wall on
the Outlide ofthe fojfc now digging round
their garden, and only those persons are to
attend theiH, who are appointed by the mu
nicipality for that purpose.
The king appears to be by no means af
fected by this or any other circumllance ;
anitlfes himfelf tranquilly by walking iu the
long allies of die garden, and observes the
workmen, who are fiilging patriotic songs,
whether he is there or not. Sometimes he

The queen is considerably altered in fi

for excellence of appetite.
When the royal family enter the garden,
every other person leaves it, except one
municipal officer. On Friday fe'ennigljt
the queen was offended that this officer
walked evenly with her party, tho' at a
conliderable distance. " I have not agreed
upon this (said Ihe) with M. Manuel."
The officer apologized*â 11 1 could not walk

there seemed to be no other line for me."
The queen then went to the prince royal,

indifference, continued his walk.
Aug. S4. âAll violences here have ceafeti,
and the operations of the conftittited autho

offered to the national aflembly from the
community ot Paris for dire&ing all the de
partments of the kingdom to take new de
nominations, and, in some measure new du
ties, there seems to be no question, upon
which the populace thi'ik they have any
thing to require from the legislature. The
aflembly passed to the order of the day upon
this petition, and seem to have excited no
discontent by the measure.
Now that the people have confidence in
the executive power, there are no longer
appeals to the aflembly by armed or rumul-f
ttious bodies, and the meetings in the Pa
lais Royal begin to decline. The populace,
except the federes, are returning to their
employments, and the latter will soon be
disposed of in the camps of Soiftbns and
Paris.
All the superior persons of the king's
household have been examined before com
missioners from the community. Nothing
new transpired from the examinations of
madame Lambelle and the other ladies.â
Hue, the king's second valet de chambre,
related, that his majesty held a council at
five o'clock, on the morning of the toth, at

went to review the troops in the garden,
who all shouted vivc le rot, except the can

The death ofM. D'Avenhoult, a mem

M. Lebrun, the minister for foreign
affairs, presented to the national assembly
a view of the present situation of France,
with refpedt to foreign powers It stated
that Sweden had already declared its in
tention of not entering into the league of
powers against France, and manifeftsd a
desire of forming a commercial connexion
with that country. Several Swedifli offi

serve in the armies of France, and to fight
in defence of liberty,

Holland and England always promised
a perse.a neutrality. The Dutch ambas

In short, hii Britannic majesty continues
to entertain the fame sentiments of perfect
neutrality, but he is of opinion that he
does not infringe this neutrality, by claim

The public are informed, in the NevÂ»

name of Governor Clinton was annexed by
mistake to the circular letter of the offi

in the state of New-York [See National

has publicly renounced all claims on the
United States for liis military services,
there would have been a riianifcft impro
priety in his signing that letter. At the
meeting mentioned, in it, the Governor

S I R,
TO cirag a private charafler into public

tempt, to draw it from the peaceful, unambi
tious, and tranquil (hades of private life, into
the glare of day to hold it up to scorn, is
high treason againfl humanity, and charac
terizes a savage and an unmanly soul âEve-
ry effort to acquire fame or fortune by ho
norable means is laudable, as every endea

When a man is obliged to become his own
panegyrist, or in common language, is obli

may be fairly inferred that his worth is

for it rarely happens that the light of a m3n

seldom loft for want of gathering ; Ameri
ca is not the foil where the valuable piant of

has thrown the gauntlet, it is in the option
of any one who feels the desire to take it

Â«f injured and insulted meritâ I am Dot ignorant
that in so doing 1 expose myfelf to much

tbejufticeof my causa will animate and
sustain me, and I will boldly meet this Go

I am not a botanist, & cannot diflinguifh the
sexes of plants, (a very important branch of
medical knowledge indeed !) it is not diffi
cult to diftinguifli the flerling bullion of the
Profeffor of the Materia Medica from the
tinfel'd dross of the hero of the letter. 'Tis
true that the Profeffor of the Materia Me-
does not imagine himfeif theyLa of all
medical, as well as every other science, and
that all is ignorance which does not imme
diately emanate from him ; but this must
be ascribed to his modesty, and might, per
haps, be cured by an attendance on a fevi of the
iotamft's leÃures, and a proper attention to his ge
neral converfatien. 'Tis alio true that he has
not the names of most authors of note by
rote, and that he has not derived an inti
mate knowledge of them from Reviews,
&c. but this defeit may be remedied by a
few lessons from the botanist, whole prin
cipal merit confilts, not in originality, but
in retail and amplification. 'Tis equally true,
his humility is fucb that he allows there are
gentlemen of science 2nd sense here as wall
as in Europe, and that not all of his brethren
of the pulse are errant blockheads ; but this
excels of diffidence might be Â»vercome by
a Utile of the overflowing from the phial of
the botanist's confidence. Reputation is a
delicate tiling in the hands of the Profeflor
of the Materia Medica ; he blights not a
fair fame by the poifonotis breath of detrac
tion, but like a good christian and a man of
feeling he covers the weaknefles, nay, even
the vices of his brethren with the mantle of
chanty. His honest and upright foul, like
the sensitive plant, (hrinks from the pressure
of calumny, difhemor, or inhumanity; he

ODDS boddikins 1 Mr. Printer, why
all this pother concerning the medi-,

dents of medicine the trouble of travelling
three or four hundred miles, especially
when it can be done at once, by a fmgle
stroke of the pen ?
In turning over the old newspapers of
thisftate, I have frequently seen receipts to
make epic poems, receipts to write antifoe
detal elTays, but I do not recollect ever to
have read a receipt to compose a course
of medical lectures.
As no gentleman has tifrned his attenti
on to this subject, and as I look upon my
felf to be a kind of a medical epicure, I
have with the afliftance of a friend tossed :
up the following, which from the excel
lency of the method, will not fail to pro- |
cure me the warm approbation of every
friend to science.
Recipe.
ift. If from an ignorance of the Englifli
grammar, a certain muddinefs of the un
derdanding, or a literal weight of brain,
you are not able to eompofe an introduc
tory lecture, a few pages on the impor
tance of health, tranferibed verbatim from
Sir William Temple's eflay on health and ,
long life, will answer the most sanguine !
expectations of your numerous auditors.
2d. As the theory of fevers will employ I
a large portion of your time, and as it I
would be unfafhionable to detail the whims j
ef Dr. Boerhaave, and for the fake of va
riety, it would be improper to copy from
the printed edition of Dr. Cullen, you
may retail the twelve manuscript lectures j
of this celebrated profeffor.
As the book is scarce, and as two thirds
of your hearers will not bo greatly diltfn
guifned for a retentive faculty, you will
run little clanger of being detected.
3d. As there are some favorite topics '111
medicine, which engage the attention of
the student, as the effects of opium, and as,
they will be generally, pretty well acquaint
ed with the opinions of Dr. Cullen, you i
can translate Dr. inaugural d flirta
tion, which with two or three experiments,
and a few words on the irritability of the !
heart, will have the effect you deilre, â;
If there are any refraflory spirits amocr '
your colleagues, who teach a different doc
trine, or have the presumption to tliiuk j
for themselves, appeal to your experience, ,
which never fails to confound your auta-;
gonifl, who is content to aflail you with ;
the flimfy arguments of reason and know- j
ledge. An appeal to experience, is a knock!
me down argument; in its eflefts it is like a
twe ve pound Ihot receiv'd between wind j
and water.
4th. As to the cold bath, you can tranf-'
late a thesis publilhed at Edinburgh in the!
year 1 -67, " de lavatione figida" to which is
annex'd an epiflle from JLinnocus, which
the ignorant compilers of the Thefaurns
Medicus, impertinent coxcombs, as if infenlible
to its merits, refufed togive a place in their
celebrated work.
sth. The doctrine of cancers is too dry
a fubjett to interest your hearers, but as
your course would not be complete with
out a few words concerning them, and as
the be!l difl'ertation, twi this fubjeft, has ap
peared in the German language, you can
translate it verbum verbo, which with an
extract or two from Guy and Juftamond,
will g,ve your lecture an air of originality.
6th. As to the great body of the course,
be sure tolet it be afecond edition of Dr. Cullen-,
as this eminent phylician has commanded
the admiration of his contemporaries, you
can give nothing better. Leave all innova
tion in science to your dull colleagues,
laugh at the fcientific production of the mo
derns, as the whims of an overheated ima
gination; do this, and altho'you fha.ll not
acquire the petty character of a man of
genius, you will be denominated " a J'clid
jellew," which is as much superior to the
former, as legal tender is to depreciated pa
per. Never publish your opinions to the
work), better is it to be infeited with the
plagUe. than with a cacoelhet fcribenoi, it has
beefc the.Ktiiaof many a weil diCpofcd
lor it is the touch stone of abilities.
Never alter your opinion, ifeverfd ful
ly convinced you are in the -vC-rong; it is al
ways the sign ofa weaknlind; be inflexible,
for an old error is better than a new truth.
In company be not communicative: re
member the wordsof Solomon, that a pru
dent man concealeth his knowledge, and a
close mouth is the sign of a wife tongue ;
take the advicc of this wife man, and the
expression of Angus Sutherland, when he
favv ?t huge owl painted upon a lign, will be
applied to you, "what it 10/es, said he, in/peak
ing it makes up in thinking."
Above all things, be grave : never mind
the opinion of Shaftfbury, who fays, gra
vity is the very efl'ence of iinpoflure, or
HochefoucauH, who declares, gravity is a
[ mysterious carri age of the body, invented

Mr. FreneAu,
THE publications against Mr. Jefferfon
since the author has been dete&ed in
his base fallhoods and foul designs, are more
like the ravings of guilt in despair, than
like the reasonings of a man in his sober sen
ses. The pretence of proof is now given
iup ; and rancour, and an aukward filly
buffoonery* has been substituted : or, if any
attempt towards circumstantial deduflion
be made, it is remarkable, thatit fall; back
with redoubled weight on the accuferhim
felf. Thus, for example, because Mr. Jef
ferfon thinks public debts no public blef
fmgs, and speaks his mind freely against
measures framed 011 that and other perni
cious and unwarrantable grounds, it has
been falfely inferred that he is an enemy to
! the government; and because the National
Gazette, being a free paper, has printed stric
tures on such measures, it is further affirm
ed, with equal malignity, that he instituted
the Gazette, and that for the destroying of
! the government. But, Mr. Freneau, if it
I is criminal in Mr. Jelferfon to disapprove
; public measuresânot with a view td illegal
j oppolitioii, but to amendment where prac
â  ticable, and to prevent further mifchief
where the evil is rivetted on the public,
! what is to be said cf his calumniator whose
principles are notoriaufly and undeniably monar
chical, and whose convefations (as unreserved
as those of Mr. JefFerfon) against republi
can government, are a constant libel on the
constitution hypocritically held up to the
I public as an obieft of attachment. Further,
fir, if Mr. JefFerfon i,; to be considered as
. having bribed the editor of the National
[Gazette, because fame of the publications
in that paper are confident with his "opini
ons j or, taking the matter the other way,
because the editor receives 250 dollars a
: year as a fixed faiary for certain business in
j his department, therefore Mr. JefFerfon is
| the patron of your paper and all its publi
| cations, then let the following facts (peak
"j for themselves :
1 "The remarks that appeared on Mr. Jif
x ferjon's Chair [fee a -writer ftgned Scourge,
jin the Gazette of the United States of
, Sep!ember 22] may have more meaning as
'â  ""ell as further malice than Jlrikei the Jirjl
â¢view. It is said that it is the Prefi icnt that
u/ls such a chair : if so, the calumniator furc
!y knoius it; and,from ivhat the public <wns
. reminded offome time ago, this indired fir ok e
of ridicule at that venerableperfonage may be
I accountedfor. The mcfl pra&ifed hypocrites
j -will fomc'imes let the majh fall, or flip aside
so as to betray themselves in their true pi vfl
j ognotny.
firji, That the Gazett-e of the United
States was set up, ds has ever been taken for
certain, under an anti-republican patron
age.
Secondly, That from the (Inftrine of titles,
and the blejjings of a public debt, down through
the laboured arguments lor hereditary go
vernment, and unconstitutional powers,&c.
unto the reprobated obftruftion of newlpa
pers, the laid Gazette has uniformly and
indefatigaMy laboured to spread the prin
ciples and views of the anti-republican
junto.
Thirdly, That the said junto, and the ca
lumniator in particular, is known to pa
tronize the editor and his paper, to make
it the vehicle of his anonymous effuftons, as
well as official publications, and to encou
rage this monarchical press by aids (having
the full effect of being dealt out from time
to time so as to keep uj> a conjlant sense of de
pendence on favour) with which the paltry sa
lary of 250 dollars is unworthy to be com
pared.
Must not the calumniator admit, accor
ding to his own logic, that the charge falftly
brought against Mr. jefferfon, as being an
enemy to the constitution, lies in truth againit
himfelf as a friend to monarchy ; and, fur
ther, that the monarchical press he patron}-'
zes is the corrupt instrument made u(Yof
by the enemies of republican government,
to sap the canftitution of their country ?

Cttrforv Remarks on the Speculations, antecedent and
Juhfcquent to the Funding Systemâmonopoly of
the National Bank, âwith a protojal to raije a
ii:-venue frsm thi fame.
To the Independent Federal ELECTORS.
IT was observed in the lad Crisis, that a
funding system, rather than a comrne/cial sys
tem, had been the p incipal object attended to by
Congress.
It is granreJ that the public credit of the Unit
ed States, should be honourably lupported j but
whether the measures pursued to accompiiih this
bulinefs, have had this salutary tendency cannot
be so readily admitted. Our national reputation
ought to be reared on th; firm bafts of public jus
sice j unless it is thus founded, i: -will soon be-
like the baseless fabric of a vision. It is
not fufficient for this purpose, that a few decla
matory paragraphs should appear in our public
papers, declaratory of our national honor and dig
nity j but the reputation and welfare of our coun r
try depend altogether, on adopting such measures
as will diffufe among the citizens at large, the
JBoit equal and permanent Wettings.
This principle was never more m cefiary to be
attended to, than in our attempts to maintain our
national credit. The fituaiio.i at" this country,
with reflect to our public debt, was peculiarly
circumstanced. The original creditors having for
the most part disposed of their no'.es, a large pro
portion ot them fell into the hands of a particu
lar clals of men, reliding in different parts of the
United Stares emphatically called Speculators.
By thÂ° mode of negotiating their bufjnefs, they
secured to themselves, at a rate vastly below their
real value, the evidences of the public debt. I
confecjuence of which, the various emiiiions of
npte9* became a species of such exter.five Specu
lation, that many persons laid 4sde every other
employment to pursue it. From the number en
gaged in this occupation, and the methods prac
ticed among them, the public flocks were ren
dered so precarious, that no citizen, who was en
gaged in any other business, could ascertain their
real value. Thus circumstanced, the notes were
under the immediate management of this del
cription of menâand the body of the people lay j
wholly at their mercy. Agents were employed to
explore every crevice of the countryâand every!
art and fiaefls were used to dispossess, ac the low
cft price, the unfulpicious citiz.-n of his proper
ty :
This was the real state of our pecuniary afr'aiis
before the adoption of the funding system j a faÂ£
with which Congress was well acquainted j and
therefore ought to have ftudioufty guarded against
further evils, by adopting a system framed upon
the moi\ simple principles : Instead of which, the
system as adopted, beinj so intricate and perplex
ing has given the utmost latitude for the conti
nuance of the greateit im partitions.
Az the time the funding system was debating
in Congrtfs, the whole body of Speculators were
collected at the focus of intelligence! -Having nc
other er/iplaytntr,;, they were constantly hovering
round the key-bole of the Cabinet. Being pof
fe/led with the minutia of information, they
were enabled to pursue the business through all its
windings j and always on the floor of Con
grefs, became acquainted with the sentiments of"
every member.âThus circumstanced, they cou-1 J
compute almoftto a certainty, the decision of any
important question, relative to the fubjett.
At this interesting period, they were fendinÂ»
their cmiflaries to instill doubts and perplexities
into the minds of the people. The indubious
part of the community* not knowing the real
state of the business, were easily per funded to part
with their notes. The public roads were throng
ed with exprefiesâAflumptUn and non-ademp
tion were alternately diftia&ing every man's brain,
who was not within the vortex of secrecy. The
system when publlfhfd was so perplexing, that
neither the merchant, tradesman or manufacturer
could fathom it, unless they gave up every other
employment to unravel its intricacies. The
plough and ax must have been laid aside, to study
the science of ftock-jobbiog. The principles of
the system being so vastly the widow
and soldier were obliged to puc them'ftJves into the
power of a negotiator, to tranfacl their mod iim
ple concerns. In fliort, the intricacy of the fund
ing system, on one hand, and the mode pursued
by this class of people on the other, has thrown
the greatest part of the public debr, comparative
ly, into the hands of a few persons*
Tne foregoing narration must be allowed by
evei7 candid man to be a real (late of fads, as it
refpetfs the conduct of a certain class of men
(with few exceptions) antecedent and subsequent
to the adoption of the funding system. The spi
rit of speculation began however to subside in a
small degree, by the notes being contracted toitb
in a small circle ; bat it was again revived, in the
eflablifhment of the National Bank. Though
this institution may be cqnfidered as beneficial in
theory, yet its operations were attended with mod
pernicious, and in some instances, ruinous confe
qnences. Immediately on its eflablifhment, sun
dry persons who had amafTed immense fortunes by
tFieir former speculations, repaired to Philadelphia,
and in a clandestine manner, Â£( assumed" to
themselves the whole nurriber of shares, notwith
standing the provision of Congress to prevent a
monopoly. By this ungenerous and illtgai mea
sure, hundreds (who had deposited their money
in the MjfTachufetts state bank, agreeably to th'
request of Mr. Hamilton) were wholly excluded,
and became exnofed to the most horrid impositi
ons, provided they were desirous to become stock
holders. Thousands and tens of thoufinds of
Hollars-were, by this monopoly, acquired by a few
individuals within the short space of one month.
If t'n's immense property had been obtained up
on the fair* principles of negociation, no objeftin
could be made to it ; but it cannot b;t excjte th
greatest indignation, when ic is considered tha'
this acqu'fition is the result of a most avaricious
monopoly, and a notorious violation l of the aci of
Congress. A breach of law of infinitely left mag
nitude', would fubjeft a merchant to the lofa 01
his vefiel and cargo.
The Bank as it now stands, may operate rather
as a political machine, than as a system of public
anu general util u. The directors of the national
bank being principally members ot Congress, it
may become subservient to the purposes of gov
ernment. The dire&ors of the leveral branches,
being also so largely inteiefted, it is prelumed
they will be ever ready to a ill (t in luch plans as
will extend their undue influence. In time there
fore, every man in business may become so com
pleady under the controul of this Herculean mo
nied ftrengfh, as to be obliged to submit to what
ever terms may bi imposed on him.
From the foregoingobfervations, it appears that
the bank, however calculated in the firft instance
for the benefit of the public, has by a monopoly,
become almost intirely the property of men (with
few exceptions) devoted to the business of specula
tion- This being the cafe, it must be considered
unjust and nnrealonable, that they should by
mere ait and finefTe, enjoy the immense advanta
ges arising from the institution. No pexfon can
point out, why they are incitied to such exclusive
privileges, from any benefits government has ever
experienced from them, either during the war, or
since the peace.
The dodlrine of discrimination was advanced in
Congress, while the funding system was debating ;
but on this fubjett, the speculating interfjl was so
interwoven with the original creditors, it was dif
ficult, and even ofliole ro lej arate it. But in
the institution of the bank, this /peculating in&cr
eft may be considered as brought to a focus. The
ftcckholders being detached from every other class
of citizens, or creditors, it iff an easy matter for
government to avail themselves of f >me particu
lar benefits. It is but reasonable* that those who
have taken to themselves such exdujive advantages,
ihouid be fubjeft to some exclusive taxes. it is
therefore propokd, that the dutus of impoji and ex
cise (which bears so hard on the body of the peo
pie) should be lefj'tned, and a tax of y at leaf, three
and a half per cent, be laid on all negotiations at
the dankâto be appropriated for the dikharge of
the public debt, and to carrv on the Indian war.
Should this meafuie be adopted by Congress,
the flockholdcrs would have no reason to com
plair, as they would then receive an interest of 6
or 7 per cent, on their capital. And as a fur
ther inducement to the measure, when these peo
ple feel the operation of duties to carry on the In
dian war, it is probable it would soon subside.
It may be thought by some, that such a tax
would be unreasonable ; but if we consider the fub
jefton fair and equitable principles, I would ask,
whether it is not more jujl, that the stockholders
illould pay three and an half fer cent, out of the
profits of their oifcounts, when in the firft in
stance, the property was unlawfully obtained, and
which cost them through a long ferics of 'pecula
tion, about 7/6 in the poundâthan that a mer
chant should pay from five to fifteen per cent, du
ty en articles which coil him the. full amount of
tiuenty Jbillings ? Can it be thought more reason
able to tax a merchant extravagantly, who is em,v
ployed in a buiinefs beneficial, not only to him
lelf, but to the whole community, than a person
whfffe property is confined to vaults and cclls, and
only permitted to be issued therefrom, for his
own particular emolument, to enable him to live
in affluence on some neighbouring eminence, upon
the labors of the induftiious ? Is it more reason
able that a merchant should be exceJiively taxed
in his merchandize, on which he can obtain but a
trifling profit, than a person whose property has
arisen since his fiift purchase, 3or 400 per cent ?
but the unreasonableness of the measure must va
nish, when we consider that the revenue of import
and excise, is deposited i 1 the branch bank, and the
stockholders are enabled to loan to the amount of
this sum, and thereby receive an intcreft of at leal!
9 per cent, on the identical money paid by the
merchant. By this mode, the stockholders are re
ceiving an unwarrantable interest, not only on
their oivn funds> but even the taxes of th: merchant
become a capital for their private emolument.
With their deposits, they may attempt to co:in
teratt everv other bank within the several states,
in order to monopolize their negotiations, as they
have already their shares. The various mrthods
used to defeat the late institution of the Union
Ban k, is a proof of this observation j though
founded upon the most liberal principles, and sup
ported by a numerous class of citizens of every oc
cupation, yet it had to encounter throughout its
various llages, a most formidable opposition : But
by exertion and perfeverar.ee, ic is now in opera
tion, and from the largeness of its capital, am
the hearty support it receives from " the people",
it now stands on a Itafis too permanent to be ever
shaken.
If a tax of three and a half per cent, is in future
laid on all negotiations at the branch banks, for
the purposes mentioned, the people will fay that
Congress, in this instance, (l iuork it right."
