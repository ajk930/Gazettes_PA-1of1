Philadelphia, JnguJ] 4th, 1793.
Sir,
tT appearing th.it repeated conrraventi
ons of our neu.ralitv have taken place
in t'le ports of the United States, without
having been discovered in time tor preven
tion or remedy, I have it i'l command
fro'n the Prel'dent, to address tÂ«> the col
lectors of the refpeftive di(liiÂ£ts a particu
lar inflruction on the fubjeft.
It is expected, that the officers of the
cn'totns in each diftrift, will i;i the course
of their official fpnflions have a vigilan
eye upon whatever may be paffirg within
tile ports, harbours, creeks, inlets and wa
ters of fiich diltrifl, of a nature to contra
vene the laÂ« s of neutrality, and upon dis
covery of any thing of the kind, will rive
immediate notice to he governor of the
ft ate. and to the attorney qf the judicial
<liftrict, comprehending the diltrift ol the
ciiftonis within which any such contraven
tion m.tv happen.
To a'fift the judgment of the officers on
thiâ head, I tra ifmit herewith a schedule
of rvilrs, concerning fu idry particulars,
which have been adopted by the'Prefident,
as deductions from the laws of nenrrality.
established and received among nations.
Whatever (hall be contrary to these rt'les
will, of course, be to be notified, as above
mentioned.
There are some other points, which,
pursuant to our treaties and the determi
nations of the executive, I to notice
to you.
If any veflei of either of the powers at
-war with France should bring or fend with
in your diltrift a prize made of the fubjeÂ£ts,
people or propertv of France, it is inime
(liately to be i.'Otmed to the governor of the
Hate, in order that measures may be taken,
pursuant to the 17th article of our treaty
with France, to rblige such ,ve(Tel and her
prize, or such prize when fe it in without
the capturing vefiel, to depart.
No privateer of any of the powers at
war with France, coining within adiftrict
of the United States, can. by the twentv
fecond article of our treaty with France,
enjoy any other privilege than that of 1 pur
chaling such viÂ£tuals as (hall be necelfary
for her going to the next port of the prime
orflate Irom which (be has hercommiflion.'
If (he should do any thing belide this, it is
immediately to be reported to the governor
and the attorney of the diltricl. You will
observe by the ruies tranfinitted. that the
term privateer is undei flood not to ex'end
to vefl'tls armed for merchandize and war,
commonly called with us letters of marque,
nor. of course, to vefl'els of war in the im
mediate service of the government of
either of the powers at war.
No armed vefiel which has been or fha'l
be originally fitted out in any port of tne
United States by either of the parties at
war is henceforth to have asylum in any
diftricl of the United States. If any such
armed vefiel (Iml 1 appear within your dif
triÂ£l, (he is immediately to be notified to
the governor and attorney of the diftricl;
which is also to be done, in refpeft to anv
prize, that such vefTel fhali bring or fend
in. At foot is a lilt of such armed vefTel;
of the above defcriptton as have hitherto
come to the knowledge of the executive.
The pnrchaling within, and exporting
from, the United States, by -way of mer
chandize, articles commonly called contra
band (beinggenerally, warlike instruments
and military ltores) is free to all the parties
at war, arid is not to be interfered with.
If our own citizens undertake to cari v
tiiem to any of those parties, they will be
abandoned to the penalties which the lawt
of war authorise.
You will be particularly careful to ob
serve, nnd to notify as direitsd in other
instances, the cafe of any citizen of the
United States, who fliall be found in the
service of either of the parties at war.
In cafe any vefiel fliall be found in the
aÂ£l of contravening any of the rules 0,-
principlcs which are the ground of this in
flruction, (he is to be refufed a clearance
until (he (hall have complied with what the
governor (hall have decided in reference
to her. Care, however, is to be taken in
this, not unnecessarily or unreasonably to
embarrass trade or to vex any of the par
ties concerned.
In order that contraventions may be the
butter itisdelired that theaffi-
cer who fliall firft go oil board any veiHi
arriving within your diftrift (hall make ail
accurate survey of her then condition, as
to military equipment, to be forthwith re
ported to you, and that prior to her clear
ance a like flirvey he made, that any traiif
greflion of the rules laid down m;.y be
appertained.
liut as the propriety of any f:ich inspec
tion of a veflcl of war in the immediate
service of the government of a foreigr
nation. is not without question in reference
to the tifage of nations, no attempt is tc
be made to i ;fpefl any fucii vt si :l till fur
ther or<ler on the point.
The President desires me to fignify tc
you his moil particular expe&ation thai
the inff rucHun contained in this letter wil
be executed with the greatest vigilance,
â¢Â£>iviry, care and impartiality. Omiflion
will tend to expefe the government to in

p opbrtionably to commit the j.'.oocl f.-iitli

of France renders totally unrtecefTary a:

before the public is, ' Whether by the
treaty between tilt United States and
France, the latter have a right to fit out
Hups in our ports?' To determine this
qiieftion, it is necessary to hand to * Th e
the articles on this point, from
the Dutch and French treaties.
By the 28rh irticle of with

[Total Numb. jBB J
we Ihonld have influential citizens, who
would endeavour by sophistry, to destroy
the avowed principles and oijefrs of the
treaty. France fll |>pufi d that a conftruc
ton as liberal as that contemplated by
Franklin or Lee, would ever influ
ence the minds of Americans in all their
declfions; and generonfly concluded that
nothing farther was neceflary to determine
the intentions and defijrrts of the contract
in;; parties, than an express prohibition as
it refpeÂ£ted the other powers of Europe..
I have only to revert to the fee ing- i-f that
day, for a proof of my obfci v uion.
The principle which was ge-nerally pre
vail ng at tlie time of our adopting the Fe
deral conrtitution, ' That'what was not:
expressly given up, was retained, operated
with the molt extetifire liberality on the>
mindsof the cohtrafting parties, and guided
them in their deliberations.
Feeling a regard for the honor of my coun
try, I cannot without emotions of
read the following feruiments; as tliey may
serve to place the United States in a very
disagreeable point of view in tjhc eyes of
the citizens ot France. The words allu
ded 10. are, " It may he allerh-f,) that this
prohibition again! the (hips of pri
vates belongii gtoa 'y other nation, I'fl.
pnes a peimiliion to si. the (hips o+'pi ivates
bilongiig to prance. âBut the inference
cannot be juttly drawn. If by a prwmife
m tde to one peifoi, I retrain myfelf front
lending money to any other;] am not surely
by that retraining engagement obligul i j
lend my money to him." This kird of
reafoniÂ»g might appear with a tolerable de
gree of grace, in the common parlance be
tween two lawyers, engaged bv a tee tu
support their difffe" ent pleasâBut as a na
tion, declaring their fentimeuts on a ques
tion of the highest import, as it refpeÂ£ts the
molt fail ed of all national obligations, can
we accede without some limitation, to this
iophiftkal explanation ? Or can we suppose,
that the patriots of France, whose fouls
arc fired with the cause of freedom, arc!
.he rights ot man, will cordially refpoud to
this decision ? Call any national faith be
ounded on a more (lender basis ttian that:
at America, if such arguments are admit
ted bv â¢' the People" as conclusive and
valid r
The negative, as was before observed, as
it refpeds Other nations, is the most nofi->
tive declarâtion that could be made in fa
vour of f ranee. 1h; - article Oauds mucfi
irn-jer than if it had been f ,id,
' Tiiat tlie French privateers fhouid have
a l-iaht to fit out i'.Â«_ ii v ifels in America."
Had it flood tlHiupon the principle of
equivocation now a-i<p -d, it might have
been urged, that thÂ«' the French v ere
expref'-iy permitted, jet it d.d no; imply,
but what other nations might be allowed
the fame indulgenceâFor when r ophi.'-ry
is praftifed, a, the weapon of conti nverfy,
words however arranged, or fentimems
however exprefled, will ever fall a faci
le e in the combat.
Waving every fubterfuge of this nature,
and taking the spirit of the article on those
principles which \ve have every reason to
'iippole operated at the moment on the
minds of the contracting parties, it mutt
lie acknowledged that it Hands on the most
impregnable ground poflibleâ 1 "It fhallnot
be lawful, &c. are expreflions, which ac
cording to all the principles and design of
language, convey a conclusive idea, that
they, (the Frencn) and they only, (ball
(lave this right.
At a further proof that this was the in
tention of the parties, our Ambalfadors.
previous to the acknowledgment of our
independence, gave comnii'ffions tÂ« priva
teers, and they were permitted to ai in and
man them in France.
How far the explanation of the treaty,
by the learned Judge, corresponds with oâ
tlier fentimeuts advanced in his speech, leC
the putyic determine. He fays, â¢' To love
and todeferve an honest fame,is the duty of
a flare, as well as of a manâTo a St..te, as;
to a man, a reputation is valuableâlt re
prefl'es hostilities and secures efieeinâ lu
tranfaflions with othc?r nations, the dignity
Â»f a slate should never be permitted to fut
fer the fnialieft diminution."
These are femiments worthy ta be U'rote?
in letters of gold. Placing then the Uniticl
State" in the filuation or an individual, I
ask, provided one man was to enter int>
an agreement with another, upon the
avowed principles of amity, and it was ex
prefsl) declared, that no other pyrfon w atr
to receive certain fpecifed advantages,
whether upon the common acceptation cf
word*, and taking their peculiar circum-*
liatiies into coulUUrat'wn at the tinje theagreement iWttricTe, 'MVcmiJ ,;c:'oe con
jfidered by every impartial person, that the
pirties were exclusively ehtitled to them ?
And should any other explanation be at
tempted by either party, whether it would
be co.ilidered as an unfair measure to evade
the performance ?
If a nation, like a man, has an honefl
fame to secure, why (liould they not have
the fime line of conduct to p.irfue?âlt
reputation is valuable, as it ' represses hos
tilities, and secures efteern,'why, if we are
Anxious to keep ourselves out of the pre
fect war, and uifh to secure theefteem o(
Â«ur allies, fhonld we adopt principles dero
gatory to our honor ; and thereby, ac
cording to the judge's own sentiments,
provoke other nations to commence ' hof
lilities againfl us ?
The so egoing observations arise from
the implication that is fairly dedutible
from the article of treaty. But as the
Hon. Judge has not suggested an idea that
snv law of the Unite#l States forbids the
French from fitting out privateers in our
ports, it is prefn ned that there is no le
vi l.'itive authority to prevent it. The Hon.
j udge mut concede to th s principle, ' that
where no law is, there is no tr mgreflion.'
It behoves every person in his Itation, to
<!- cide agreeable to the promulgated laws
of the states, as no man has a right to dic
tate beyond what the law will warrant.
If it is found, that by implication the ar
ticle will bear the conUi-nii on now plead
ed for, it is the duty of t : iofe who are
called upon to decide on this question. to
request the meeting of congress, that the
principles may be thoroughly investigated
by the representatives of the peop/e ; and
if neceflary, such efficient laws enacled,
whereby every citizen may know the pre
cise ground on which he stands.
To conclude, no good citizen willies
this country to become a partizan in the
present war ; but as we are in treaty with
the molt fprmid tble nation in Europe, let
us give it the mod fair and liberal con
ftr.uction. Let lis b. careful, that while
we are anxious not to i \ o ve ourselves in
a war with the other power , that we do
not difalfeit our only European ally. Lit
us not forget their ferviees, while the hand
of Britain was heavy on us ; but let us re
member, that the cause of France is the
caufeof universal freedom; and on their
success depend ihefulme liberties of the
United States.

Sir,
BEING an American by Ttirth, an early
admirer of your principles and conduit,
and feeling a conscious less of the dignity
attached to a free citizen of the United
States, I take the liberty of addrelfing you
in this public manner. Sure I am, that if
jou were acquainted with the secret re

impr pr exprefF.on, and give a favourable
confti u lior. to Â»vhat may be offered on the
present occasion. Sir, I have watched in a
ipecial manner the conduit of your ene
mies, and the enemies of our country, from
the commencement of the declaration of
3nde|sendeiice; and the time was, when our
highly refpefted General despised their se
cret machinations, and brought to light
private intrigues ; the time was, when the
Man of the People, would make
known a Duclie, as well as an Andre,
when it had become proverbial amongst
enemies, as well as friends, that Wafliiig
ton vjns impregnable i and believe me, Sir.
my opinion itill remains the fame in refpeft
to you but jealousies have gone forth ;
permit me to observe to you upon what
ground they have taken their rife.
Our mutual enemies act confidently : â
they have endeavoured to dedroy the re
fpett, vigilance, and activity of all true
friends to their country, by reporting all
manner of evil of them falfely ; they have
so far fueceeried, that it is well known
many of our old wiiigs have been reproach
e their char?.Â£iers vilified, and means
Taken to ruin them ; that in consequence
100 many of our veteran , feeling the
-weight of the infuit, have loft their forti
tude, and lade* into despondency : they
have exulted at their ruin ; but, Sir, view
Their conduS in the promulgation of the
present conilitution. Their constant game
was to play federal againlt anti-federal,
jnen that had no other design than to raise
up a people, from their vociferous bellow -
jngs, to oppose them, and by that lfreans,
place their conduit to the overturning the
conflitution ; for believe me, Sir, it is
neither you. nor the constitution of Ame
rica, fht y love or admit e, but a divition of
The peopleâExamine their conduit: with
regard to your proclamation, and their ad
<Jre{Tc'S to you on that occasion. Eelore it
was fcarcily read, did they not run to you
â¢with their deceitful compliments ou the
occasion, and for the express purpose, as
above Hated, knowingthai the real friends
of tiieir country could, nor would not join
lier known and noted enemies ; and if a
fnigli individual (honk) think it his duty to
write or (peak on the fubjeft, the whole of
the great body of the people, real friends,
and uniform democrats, are vilified in ail
the public, oewfpapers, with' charges
roundly alf-i'teÂ«l, as flnti-faderalifts, cne,

government, disposed to anarchy, witl
every other' diabolical chargeâExamine
their line ef conduct, and compare it with
those that are enemies to the republic of

For the NATIONAL GAZETTE.
THE insidious characters which have
lately evinced their diiTatufaftion to the
glorious revolution of the French, have
now thrown off the ma(k which has so lonp
concealed their real thai-afters, and have
poured forth a licentious torrent of the
molt unmerited abuse upon the character
of a Man, whose conduct has still manifefl
ed him worthy the office of the repre
sentative of a free peopie, whose talent'
hive declared he peflefles ab lities equa
to ihe talk, and whefe virtues mult make
him rtfpefled by every friend to liberty.
Charges, the inÂ»lt innocent in their nature,
and trifling in their conferences, have
been adduced to public view, blackened
with all the malevolent inferences, height
ened with the molt calumniating accufari
011s, and couched in the melt abusive lan
guage, which men, guided byperfonal re
sentment, could invent. Happy, however,
for M. Genet, he is above the reach of
those enemies who would v illi to asperse
his character, and so long as he continues
to pursue measures which are as confident
with his capacity, as he has already adopt
ed, he will experience the fatisfaclion ol
being respeCted by those who applaud the
caule of his country. Asa man of sensi
bility, however, it cannot but wound hi:
feelings to meet with a reception, among
a free people, so contrary to his own ex
pectations, and those of his countrymen.
The friends of tyranny have now triet!
innumerable resources to make the inhabi
tants of these United States difaffecfed tc
France. The aCts of vengeance whicr
have signalized the revolution have beer
held up in the molt outrageous colours:
The decapitation of their tyrant has beer
brought forth to awaken our sympathy ;
the illegitimate authority of the Conven
tion; the profane characters who compose
that tumultuous body ; the tyrannical fac
tion of the Jacobins, and finally the condufl
of their ainbaiiador, are reprobated, an<
made a fubjeit of expatiation : no doubt,
with a view of seducing us to a violatior
of those treaties, which, so far from being
annihilated, by a change of sentiment in
our allies, have received additional llrengtl;
and for the fulfilment of which, our nati
onal honour and prosperity are pledged.
It may not be improper, in contemplat
ing the subjeCt under conlideration, to ob
serve the drain of those writers who have
impeached the conduct of Mr. Genet in
declaring hisdetermination to appeal to the
people. One of the molt conspicuous o)
those characters, is a person who has rru
dered himfelf notable to the public, by
' volunteering' an address to the ambassa
dor after he had relided in Philadelphia ;
fufficient time lor the citizens of the ' mid
dle states to have been acquainted with hi
coi.duCt while to the southward.' How
his principles have been thus ' regenerated
is a problem, which many may not find
it difficult to solve. I have only to indulge
the hope that some one who has more lei
sure than myfelf, will take the 4 trouble 1
of ' answering' his lengthy publication;
which have appeared in the " New-York
Daily Advertiser' and re-publifiied in mofl
of the newspapers of this city; left, he
should again fliew track, and either run to
the other fide, or fink into ignominious con
tempt or oblivion.â'l'fhall make but a
remark or two upon his pre.lix observati
ons.
"Mr. Genet declares that if the rrefi
dent of the U. S. pursued meafHres agree
ably to his [own] construction of treaties,
he (Mr. Genet) would appeal to the peo
ple.' In a republican country, the people
Slone are the balls of the governmentâ
All powers being originally derived from
them, can, by concurrence of a majority,
be by them withdrawn at pleafnreâ'They
alone are the authors of the law, and to
them alone. Bull the ultimate decision of
the interpretation belong. An assertion,
then, of Mr. Wil'cocks, that ' all' the
powers of government have been resigned
to the representatives' cannot have any
foundation to support it. The represen
tatives are entrulted with particular pow
ers only, which are guaranteed by the
constitution. The reft still remain in the
exclulivepolfeflion of the people, to be ex
erciled at pleasure. The * sovereignty' of
our legillative, but more particularly of
our executive department, is a doctrine as
incompatible with the principles of liberty,
as it is inconsistent to be taught by one,
who profeifes to be a republican. An in
tcrpretation of the treaty by the ' Prclident'.
(Vattelismy authority) when it claflies
with Mr. Genet's, is of no more validity
then that of the anibaffador. If then the
Prelident pursued measures agreeably to
* his' interpretation, why has not Mr. Ge
net an equal right to conduit himfelf in
conformity to â¢ his' opinion ? He chose
however to appeal to the authors of the
treaty, to whom the Prelident is doubtlef
responsible. No doubt this remonllrance
will be conveyed in the regular mode r<
their ' reprefentatives'who ' virtually ccn
ftitute the people.' Whether tlvis alfertion
Humid have been a just cause of such scur
rility, as has been vented against the author,
every candid inind is capable of judging.
The other charges exhibited against Mr
Genet, are too futile to merit a moment's
consideration. They serve, however, to
lliew the disposition of those who step for
ward to accuse him. The infiirrecfions &
tumults they speak of, are chimeras which
exit! only in the p<"ricraniums of the au
thors. Not until 'offences'of a more hei
nous nature are exhibited, can they merit
the attention of the public. But. whilst.
a coincidence of sentiment with many ref
peftable citizens of this country ; the re
fufal of complying with requests, deemed
unreasonable : and the writings of his se
cretary, are imputed as crimes to Mr. Ge
net, those who are friends to the cause in
which his country is engaged, those who
are not enemies to the progress of univer-
Pal freedom, mud applaud his conduit, and
approve of those measures which he ha
already pursued, and which are perfectly
:onlil>ent with that prudence and magna
limity which will ever ilillinguilh the ho
left representative as a free, generous,

" On the principles of a neutral pow
er, our adtions as .1 nation, whatever oui
w fiiea may be in the contest, arc to be
perfectly indifferent to each party. We
have as mechanics and merchants a right
to labour for, or supply each party, at
their request. Should arms, money, (hips,
or any other things neceflary to carrying
on the war, befupplied by our merchants,
the party against whom it is to be used,
has a right to seize it on the hij>h seas,
and to make it prize as contraband goods;
but our (hipping the fame is no breach of
neutral laws. Our citizens owing allegi

to engage in the armies, or on board the

But we Hand with France on a treaty,
which places us on a footing rather wid<
F.om a state of neutrality and indifference.

Captain Crabtree, lately from the Well;
Indies, gives the following extraordinary
account of a Sea Serpent, the authenti
city of which may be depended on.
" On the 2Cth June lad, being on my*
pnffage from the Weft Indies, in the
morning, having just made Mount Desert
island, diltant nearly ten leagues, I sud
denly got fight of a serpent of an enor
mous lize, swimming on the furface of
the ocean, its head elevated about fix or
eight feet cut of water, rather prone for
ward. That part of the body which was
out of water I judged to be ahout thefize
of a barrel in circumference, but the head
larger, having some resemblance of a
horse's head.. According to the molt
accurate computation which J made in
my mind, of his length, I think it could
not be less than from 55 to 60 feet, and.
perhaps longer. That part of the body
which was not elevated, but of which I
had a distinct view several time?, was
larger than the part out of water; the
body of a dark brown. I was within' 200
yards of it rear an hour, during which
time, as it. discovered no inclination to
moled us, myfelf and the whole crew ob
served it with the minuted attention, nor
was its attention less fixed 011 us. The
:ye was perfe&ly black, Iharp and pierc
ng. 1 was lo near it as to observe clearly
hat there were no fins or external appen
ds to the body, but that its motion
was by the writhing of the body like
:>ther lerpents. During the time it was
with us, several flocks of birds flew near,*
which it eyed very closely ; I observed in
it the greatest agility and quickness of
motion."
There is no doubt but this is one of
the two which have been seen in these
parts. All accounts agree refpefling their
!.ze and appearance. Two of them, perÂ«

manner, gave tile following words of com

" Gentlemen, you that have short knee'd
breeches and who e Iho , Hand in the front
âyou that have long ti ovvfi 1 and no (hoes,

mand : " Turn your f.iics to couliti iue's

wordsâ' by J- âj, the cattle in Ireland
"would in o>Â»e night dung an island as large
as Bermuda, and yet they could not bo.'dl

rheie isa hot war with the Spaniard;

French and Spaniards; the French have
defeated them, with the loTs of about 200 c
men, and the Spaniards upwards of 600 c

From the Connecticut Courant.
TvIUCH has been said and written on
the fiibjctl of the French revolution.
Americans appear 'o be deeply concerned
for the fate of the French ; as the proj;refs
â¢of liberty in Furope seems to depend
much upon the event of the â¢present
â struggle. A great proportion of Anaeri
cans however lament the fate of i.ouis,
the late king; and almofl all parties con
cur in ccnfuring the outrageous proceed
ings of the mobs in various parts of France.
"Yet few, I believe, of the people of this
â countrv, even of the more learned, know
the ex'ent of the abufc of the old govern
ment, or the wretchedness of the great
body of the people. The severe and
mullifariou despotism exercised over the
pe dantry of ihat immense country under
the monarchy, if it will not jullify every
outrage,will at lead apologize tor the moil
<lefperate efforts of the people to rid them
selves at once of the tyrants and the tyran
ny. To enable the people of America to
form some cdimate of the necefiity of a
â reformation of government, and to judge
â with candor o' the violences committed
ia France in p ofecuting this business, I
beg leive to c mmunicate to the public
a (ho: t abftraft of that fyllem of despo
tism, which has been overturned by tht
French under which the tnafs of tht
â¢people in that country have groaned foi
ages. The fubltance of what is hert
offered is taker, from a writer of unquef.
tionable authority.
1. The B llile, that engine of oppref-
during some reigns had been filled
â with prisoners, who without even know
ing the cause or author or their arrest,
been doomed to darknefo and chains
for life. At some periods defpotif.n hat
Tifen <o high, that blank lettres de cat
chet have been feld, to bi tiilcil up with
names at the plenfure of the purchaser.
2, But Letlres de Catchet tho' formi
dable to individuals, were among the leaji
inllmments of tyranny. Some of tht
heavielt Uxes were levied wholly on the
poorer clajfes of people ; the rich nobility
and clergy being exempt from paying
them. These taxes were colle&ed with
unfeeling rigor by the imendants of gene
ralities and their fub-delcgates, who were
â veiled with absolute authority to enforce
4he collection.âln addition to this the
inequali y of the duties and taxes was
fucti as to mark an attoni hing degree ol
corruption in the whole fyllem. Some
provinces had, during the exp nfive wars
of former kings purchased an exemption
from the Gabelle or duty on faitâfome
paid a small excise of 8 or 9 livfces on the
100 cwt. and perhaps the very next pro
-vince paid 50 to 60 livres.âSuch an
imin nte difference of duty in pr vinces
Jeparated only by a river or perhaps an
imaginary line, encouraged (muggling,
and finuggling was was punished with
unheard of fevetityâ-fines, condemnation tc

â were poor people, guilty of no crime but
that of attempting to smuggle a little fall
for their families, to avoid the monstrous
tax of Bor 10 dollars on the bufliel. Yet
all persons fubjedl to the Taille, in
some provinces, were enrolled and obliged
to buy 7lb. a head of fait annually (ex
clusive of fait for barrelling meat) whether
they wanted it or not.

so produced; mowing hay before a-cer
tain time, whih was io la e often-times as
to spoil the crop, and taking away the
fhibble, left the birds should be robbed of
shelter. These capitaineries extended
over 400 leagues of the country, and such
was the tyranny eiercif d in them, that
in the late revolution almoit all dafTes of
people concerted in demanding the sup
predion of them
4. By a barbaronfiy inhuman and op
prelfive law, the people were bound to
grind their corn at their lords mills only,
to prefa their grapes in press and bake
their bread in his oven. Bv means of
this reftriftion, they were often obliged to
wait till their bread was fpailed and their
grapes damaged. Thev were not indulg
ed the privilege of using hand-mills for
grinding their corn ; even in the modern
times tlte barons have ordered the hand
mills of their peasants to be broken, and
have obliged them to purehafs the right
of bruising their buck wheat and barley be
tween two ones.
5 The corvees or police of the roads,
by which the laboring people were called
out to work on the roads at the pleasure
of their mailers, was an engine of extreme
oppri-ffion. Many hundreds of farmers
were ruined annually by it, and 300 were
reduced to beggerv, in filling one vale in
Loraine
6. Nothing could exceed the opprefii
ons suss. red by illegal and arbitrary exer

of manors; appeals endless, augmenting
litigations, favoring every fpeaes of chi

loss of time, the provincial parliaments
were unbjufhingly corrupt, intercd was
openly made with them and wocto the man
who had not raoney or a handsome wife to
procure favour.
7. A heavy fine of an eighth, and
sometimes of a sixth was paid at every
sale of property 4 besides a fine at every
change, whether in the direst 1 r collateral
line of deLent. Feudal redtmpfiont, ty -
rannical cuiloms, and arbitrary affeflments
woul fill the catalogue of opprefiion ; hut
the very terms cannot be translated. We
have neither tUe ideas nor words to express
tiiem. I will however jult mention
one feudal right called in French Silence
des grenouilles, by which, when the l dy
of the manor lay in, the peasants were
obliged to beat the wat r in marshy plac
e&! to keep the frogs silent; that the lady
need not be diltutbed. This opprcflive
duty was afterwards commuted to a lum
of money
A man who can coolly refleA on the

other cruel despotic laws or cufloms, and
yet cenuires the outrages of a mob which
murders a single tyrant or burns a chateau
without apologizing in his own mind for
their licentiousness, must be void of prin
