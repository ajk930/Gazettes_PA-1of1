Report of the Secretary of the Treasury,
relative to the Loans negotiated ui:der
the acts of the 4th and 12th of August,
179<3-
[Continued from our laji.}
AN enquiry naturally arises hereâWere
the monies which were drawn from
Europe on account of the foreign loans,
the instrument of the purchases, to which
these beneficial effefls are ascribed ?
I answer, that these purchases arc to be
attributed to the ihftrumentality of that
fundâthat had it not been for this re
foiu-ce they could not have been made at
tiie early periods, when most of them
were made. The cnurfe of the tranfacTi-i
on wili be fully and with more propriety
explained in another place.
An attention to both objectsâto the re
imbursements to France, and to the pur
chases f the debt, rendered expedient a
fiibdiviiion even of the firft loan. Conli
derations of the moment seconded those of
a general nature, to induce an immediate
payment to that countryâThe loan had
been undertaken without previous autho
rity from hence, with a view to such pay
ment. This was known and a correfpon
deut expectation excited. The immedi
ate situation of the French finanses, ren
dered a payment at the particular juncture
more than ordinarily interesting. 111 such
a (late of things, there could be no hesita
tion, about applying a large part of the
loan to that object. Anotherpart of it wai
of necessity applied to the payment of the
sums, that were falling due on the Dutch
loans. And it Is presumed, that the rea
sons which have been afligned, will ap
pear to have been fufficiently powerful to
have dictated the drawing of a part of it
to the United States.
Accordingly, a million and a halt of the
three millions borrowed, were appropri
ated to France ; something mare than
Soo v coo guilders were drawn syr here,
Aad't'ii- remainder of tSeifca3"wk to
be dilbarfed in Holland. j
' It shall not be concealed, though 1 am
aware that the acknowledgment may be a
fubieft of criticism, that the condua which
was nurfued, both with regard to this and
to the fncceedi'ng loan, was in fomed egree
influenced by a collateral confutation.
The government had but jlift adopted a
plan tor the reftorationof public credit. The
periodical payment ofintereft was to com
mence on the Ift of April 1791. A con
siderable part of the revenue out of which
the monies were to arise, was only to be
ein to accrue on the firft of January pre
ceding This revenue was liable to cre
dits of four, fix, and twelve months.
How far its eventual product would an
swer expectationâhow far the punctuali
ty of payments could be relied upon, were
point* unascertained, and which required
to their ascertainment much more expe
rience than had been obtained. In such
situation it was not only natural, but ne
cefiary for an administrator of the finances
to doubtâand doubting it was his duty to
call to the aid of the public credit, every
auxiliary, which it was in his power to
command âHe was bound to reflect, that
a failure in any stipulated payment would
be fatal to the dawning credit of the coun
tryâto the reputation of the government,
iuft beginning to rife. That a wound in
flitted upon either, at so early a stage, un
der all the circumstances ot opposition to
the constitution, which had exilled in the
community, would have been deep.y felt,
and might either not have admitted of a
cure at ailornot till after * length of time,
and a series of mifchiefsâthat it could
rjot but be an important service rendered
o the country, to ward off so great a mif
fortune, by the temporary life of any ex
traordinary resource, which might be at
hand, till time was given for more effectu
al provHion.
If iri the course of such reflections, a
, doubt had occurred, about the stria regu
larity of what was contemplated, asipof
fible resort, a mind fufficiently alive to the
public interest and fufficiently firm in the
purfuitofit, would have dismissed thai
doubt, as an obstacle, suggested by a pu
sillanimous caution, to the exeicife 01
those higher motives, which ought evei
to govern a man, inverted with a great
public trust. It would have occurred thai
there was reasonable ground to rely, thai
the necessity of the cafe, and the magni
tude of the occasion, would irifure a juf
tification, and that if the contrary Ihould
happen, there remained still the consola
tion of having facrificed personal interest
and tranquility, no matter to what extent,

to an important public interest, and of ha
ving avoided the humiliation, which would
have been jultly due to an opposite, and to
a feeble conduit.
The disposition which was resolved upo 11
with regard to the tirft loan, involved ne
cefl'arily a decilion of the point, that the
loans might be placed on the joint foun
dation of both aÂ£ts. That loan having
been undertaken, as already mentioned,
without previous authority, and conse
quently without a particular eye to either
act, it was probable, that it would be
found too late to make an apportionment
of one part of the sum borrowed to one
ait, of another part to the other act. In
that cafe, the distributive application of
the fund to the d'.ffereiit objects was to be
relinquished or the pofiibility was to be ad
mitted, of the loan being left to stand up
on the authority of both acts. The fame
disposition of the firlt loan, will also illus
trate the convenience and expediency ot
the plan which was finally adopted, that is,
of placing the loans on the bafls of both
acts.
The idea of a concurrent execution
of both the objects to which the loans
were deHined, could not conveniently
have been pursued, upon the plan of a se
paration of the loans ; which to be effec
tual, would include the' drift application
of the proceeds of each to tile purposes o:
the particular ast, upon which it was
founded.
Amsterdam was naturally looked to, a?
the great scene of the intended loans.t-
There, as everywhere else, there is but a
certain quantity of money floating in the
market from time to time, beyond tht
neceflary demands of trade and industry,
Peeking for employment in loaps. Thi
quantity, of course, varies at different peri
ods, from a variety of causes. Of the
quantity at any time afloat, but a certwi:
borrowing power ; owing to the compe
tition of other borrowers, who have each
their connexions through their bankers,
with different fetsof undertakers "and mo
ney lenders. Nor is it always that conii
derable loans can be had at any rate. â
There are certain feufons only, when
they are practicable.
To have brought two loans upon the
market at one time, as an opportunity of
borrowing offered, which must have been
the cafe in order to make concurrent
provision for both the objects in question,
if the principle of a separation of the loan;
had been adopted, would have been to
exhibit to the money lenders a very unu
sual appearance. With men known to be
much influenced by precedent and habit,
such an apppearance could not have failed
to prove a i'ource of speculation aud con
jecture ; and might have led to a confu
fed idea that the wants of the United
States were excefiive ; a supposition, by
no m?ans calculated to promote their cre
dit. It would moreover have been a de
parture from that simplicity of procedure,
which,where numbers are concerned,is al
ways of moment to a right conception of
the bulinefa to beaccomplifhed., and ought
not to be abandoned, but for reasons of
real utility and weight.
To have instituted the loans fucceffive
ly,founding each,upon one or other of the
acts, would have had a tendency to occ.l
- longer intervals between thepaymenti
to France, than was desirable. 'The in
tervention of a loan for the purpose of
purchases, would have created of course a
very coniiderable chasm. It may be ob
jected that such chasms did happen on the
plan which'was pursued. This is true in
two instances ; but the molt material of
the two proceeded from cafualties'foreign
to the plan vtfelf ; which are detailed in
the correspondence more than once allu
ded to.
It ispolfibletoo that a separation of the
loans might have rendered it less easy to
take advantage of a state of the market,
favourable to their extension at a particu
lar juncture. The loan to be brought or
the market might relate to the purdiafe ol
the debt . The moment might be favour
able to a more coniiderable loan, than wa:
within the limits prescribed for that object,
and the opportunity might flip before' t
feeond could be inftitu ed. Iu this busi
ness moments are often of importance,
and are to be embraced with promptitude
and dexterity.
Thus it appeal s, that in different way:
the negociation of the loans might have
been embarralTed by their separation.
But the mod obvious, if not the molt ferU
ous of the inconveniencies which would
have attended it, refpeÂ£ts th? application of
the sums borrowed- This could not then
have been moulded, as the interelt or po
licy of the government might dictate, A
loan for the purchase ps the debt might
iMve been made under profpeits, proini
ulig a ready and berieficial inveltmenc of
it r but befof-e the ihvefhnent was made,
:â  change of the market might render'it
ineligibleâinvolving the alternative, ei-
Cher of a difadvantajjeous investment, or
of leaving perhaps a large film of money
a long time unemployed. Such a ltate of
things might have produced to the banks
an advantage, and to the government a
a loss, of magnitude fufficient to give co
lour to a fiirmife, that the public in
terelt had been facrificed to the profit of
thole inltitutions. The contrary course
has eflentialfy avoided that evil; which in
this and in Other instances, would have
been incident in a far greater degree, to
the modes of proceedings, contralted with
ihofe that have been puvfued ,'t!ian has in
reality attended them.
Or political conliderations might have
rendered it advifeable to transfer the ap
plication of the fund from one objeÂ£t to
*he other.
' Of this, the cafe of St. Domingo presents
[11 example. It might have happened on
i>e plan of fepsfrate loans, that there was
,;o tond in hand but for the purchase ut
he debt* Then On the principle of that
)ian, there would have been uo fund, in
;!ie disposition of the executive, applicable
'.o the other object, which would have em
jarrafled the performance of a duty to
wards a friendly power, ana ift a way
which included the positive advantage to
kiie country of paying direitly a part of its
foreign debt, in its own productions.
Such were the embarraifments avoided,
.. ,Â«! (wrh the conveniences secured, by the
.nT.-.y"!' â â  â ' ff'v' 1, ,
upon the authority of both acts.
In the opposite plan, I can discern no
counterbalancing advantage nor conveni
ence.
Consequently, if both are equally legal,
there can be no doubt which of them
ought to have been preferred.

To the EDITOR of the NATIONAL
GAZETTE.
SIR,
XT is incumbent on every one who re
gards the interelt aiid happiness of his
country, to take notice of every flioal and
rock that have proved fatal to other re
publics, and endeavour to guard against,
the like mischance in this happy land. Un
pleasant as the tall', is, to publicly censure
the conduct of any of my fellow citizens,
yet as the public welfare, in my opinion,
is involved ; I conceive that silence would
be criminal The measure 1 alkide to,
was the celebrating the birth day of the
President of the United States, by a part of
the city militia. It appears by the condutt
of fonie men, that we are only republicans
in name and not in principle. Kor sure
ly the cultoms and manners emanating
from, and congenialXvith, monarchy, mult
be incongruous in a rep'iiblic. Who will
deny, that the celebrating of birth days is
not a striking feature of royalty ? We hear
of no such thing during the republic of
Rome. Evert Cincinnatus, now conlign
ed to immortal fame, received no adulati
on of this kind. I am as fertfible of the
services of the President as any man, and
think him worthy of the high regard of his
country. But surely the office he enjoys is
a fufficient tMtimony of the people's f*-
vour, without \vorlhipp<ng him likewise.
I believe, 1 may venture to fay, thstt such
fiilfome adulation does not accord Xvith
his feelings'.
If this evil was of no greater extent,
than merely debasing thole who are in
the practice of it, I fllould not feel much
concern. But when I conlider it a fore
runner of other monarchical vices, and
holding up an improper example in this
country, and an example at precedent, I
cannot but execrate the measure. I api
well aware that courtiers, and all the sy
cophantic tribe, will endeavour to take off
the force of these remarks, and others of a
(imilar nature, that nave been lately made
by some' republican writers, by bawling
out faÂ£tion, fedition&c. I trull, however
for the honour of my cenntry. that such
characters are riot, as yet, numerous hare.
[Total No. 139.],
The/ are therefore of no consequence.
But there are others, who fee and judge
only through the falfe medium ot pafioii'
ar prejudice, that may not relilh theft opi
nions. To them I' would ju3 oijferver
that the novelty ot* any doctrine ought not,'
to be an argument against Itânor Ihould it*
be condemned without a fair aftd difpafli
onate crimination. I appeal thefi to the
joodfenfe of my countrymen; whether, by
placing one man above all equality aÂ«d
heaping honours upon hrm, it does not, iu
the fame proportion, lefleu the eOnfe--'
quence of every other person : And, whe
ther this is not (owing the feeds

Sly produce a change in cur government L/
It is true, that during the administrati
on of the present chief magittrace, these
predictions may not be realized,. 11 His 4'uc
cefl'er however may be a different chai*ac- 1
:er. He may poflefs immoderate ambition

His person mull be made

pie, having unfortunately fufjered ha-'
bits of fertility to-gain Urength among
them; and their minds being-qf
corrupted, will not' fe& their danger un-'
till it is too late to' be remedied. Whoe
ver doubts these affertiomâlet him recur
to history for their'truth. He will there
find; that the making oneperfon more than'

FRENCH AFFAIRS.
PAR I â >, Dec 27.
Yc-fterday morning*at 9 o'clock, the 1111-
fortun ite Loi.'.s was brought to the bar of
the Natio;; 1 convention, accompanied by
tile Mayor Â«>' Pari.-, and several othersâBe
in; required by the i-refident to make his
ulrim ue defence, he answered, that "his
defence wouid he read to them by hi coun
fei"âM. de Seze, his'counfel, then began,
and continued reading bis defence for fe
ver ll hÂ«> irs, of which the following is an
abftraft :
" Citi zen Reprefeut.itives of the Nation,
the mom mi t is then arrived, in which Lou
is, accnfed in the name of the French peo
ple, and rtirrounded by the Counsel which
hum uiity and tile /aw have given, him, is
about to deliver hisjufthication. Even the
fii: nee with Which we arc surrounded, in
form. me, that the day of justice has fuc
c reded to tile day of presumption and pre
jndyiient. The mi. fortunes of kings have
fomctuing much more affecting and more
sacred than those of other men ; and he
who once occupied the mod brilliant
throne in the uaiverfe. ought to excite the
mo:' powerful inter, its. ion have called
him into the midlt of you, and he is come,
with calrimefs, with dignity, strong in his
innocence, supported by the cefliuiony of
a whole life. He has discovered to you
such to be his thoughts, by difcuiing, with
out preparation, without examination,
charges which he could not forefee,and of
fering an ext<finporary defence. Louis
could onlv tell you of his innocence ; I
come to prove it. Would that this circle
could increafi? till the whole multitude of
citizens, who have received a dreadful im
preliiou r.g'.iu.l him, could be contained in
it, that they might form i different opin
io 1. Louis kna-.v; that Europe expects,
with impatience, the judgment which yon
(hall give ; he knows, that poilerity will,
one t' Iy, invefligr.te it ; blithe conliders
oily his contemporaries. Like him, we
forget posterity, and fee only the present
moi.ic-Jt/'
M. de Seze then said, that the question
wight he conlidered in two points of view,
eitrier with res;. -ft to Louis before or af
ter hi â¢ acccptance of the conftitutioh. The
nation, he admitted, was the Sovereign,
;:nd was free to give itfelf what form of
government t plc-afed ; but the nation it
felf could not e.v rcife its own sovereignty,
an<| mull, therefore, delegate it. In x 789
the n tio l chose a ilionarohic'al government,
a id decreed the inviolability of its chief-
He theji Ihewcd, that the forfeiture of the
throne was the only punishment to which
the king, according to the constitution,
could be subject ; ; nd that it was only for
crimes committed alter this deilitution,
that he could be tried, like other citizens.
Either the crime.", of which Louis was ac
cused, were .held crimes by the constitu
tional act. -'.nd of course, if proved, were
to be pondh'ed according to th,.t ast, or
1 hoy were not to be found in it; and were,
therefore, not to be punillied at all.
He* would, however, admit, for argu
ment fake, that ;he crimes were all prov
ed, and all mentioned in the conditutional
act. What then was thepunifhment? The
i'. idicruion of the throne. But it might be
fnd, that the nation had already abolilhcd
the throne, so that there was no further
pi liihment of L"ui< : were new laws to be
;.i ide, nplic hie only to one man, and
forme ! n.ue the accvfation itfelf ?
If, 110 vev<>r,Louis was to be deprived of
hi s inviol ibility as a king, he mall then, of
course, have the right of being judged like
a ci;iand, i.i that cafe, where were
the pre:' rv.it >ry forms of trial decreed for
c;i .c-.i rr the law? Where were the ju
rors. those ho'iges for the lives and honor
of citizens ? Where was the proportion of
fu'rrages which the law had so wifely e
iidbii J ? .Where that lilent ballot which
iiiclofed within the fame urn, the opinion
and co.ifci .-ice of the judge? 'â¢ I (peak to
you," said M. de Seze, " with the freedom
of a free man ; I search among you for
judges, and I fee only accusers ; you would
ujve judgment upon Louis, and you have
accused h 11 ; yon would'tryhim, and you
have already e .preifedyour will.
" As to the c' I'ce of having widied to
difiblve tiiii lot:on:il Allembly. Was it
forgotten that Louis had convoked it?
Wa; it forgo : 1 t.'iat dun !;; 150 years,
Princes, more jealous of.their authority,
ha'd coniiant'y rcinicd t :.tt convocation ?
Was it taat iÂ»-t for Louis âbut
for the numerous facrinces to which he
had coiifented, the audience could not
then be fitting to deliberate upon the inte
relts ot' the State ?"
He would not then (peak of the Mpmoir
in whie Talon was faiti to have the care
of p i'iid i: dug a counter re volution iutiufted
i.i jjart to him ; but even upon an ordina
ry trul, could it be permitted, that paper
taken from a citizen, without an invento
ry and unsealed, by the invaiion of in,
houfs, (hould be produced in the evidence
agaiuft him ? In some of thefep ipers men
tion was made of money which had beer
expended ; but even i it had been cleniet
that this expence was for purposes of be
nevoleiice, could it be forgotten how ealil;
kings were circumvented and deceived :
The plan of a letteto La Fayette and Mi
rabeau was spoken of, but this. lettejJhi"-
nor been sent ; and as to the letter o;
thanks to Bouille, the Constituent Aiiem
bly itfelf !'ad voted thanks to that officer
But the words were still to be utterec
which would immediately overthrow the
whole series of accusation* âthey wen
these : " Subsequent to all these circum
stances, Louis accepted the constitution
"J'he constitution was the pact of alliancf
between the people & the kingâthere wa:
no longer any contentionâthe past wa:
forgotten. Vv hat had been done subse
quent to this acceptance was now to be
examined.
" The constitution had not ordered the
guarantee of the king for the Minirtert ;
but, on the contrary had commanded tin
refponlibility of the m nilters for the king
and even if the constitution was forgotten
the king and his ministers conldnot be boti
accnfed for the fame aits. Louis had beci
accused of delaying the execution of tin
decree relative to Avignonâthe minittei
Delettart had been accused of the fanit
thing. Louis had been accused of not
communicating intelligence of the treat;
of Piinitz ; but was not that the province
of the minister, even if it had been a pub'
Jic instead of a secret tranfiction ? He hat
been reproached with the troubles o:
Nimes, Jales, and other places ; but wa
the king to be answerable for all the trou
bles of a great revolution ? The accoun:
given by Narbonne was laid to the chargc
of Louis; but had not the National As
fembly itfelf declared, th .it Narbonne car
ried with him the regrets and the confi
deuce of the nation: 1 The surrender oi
Longwy and Verdun were imputed tc
him ; but were not the inhabitants of theft
places the guilty perlons ? And who hac
appointed the commander of Verdun, v. he
chose rather to die than to yield ?
Was it not Louis ?"
M. de Seze pursued his fpeecii witl
much perspicuity, contending and (hewing
that either Louis had no knowledge of thi
circumltanoes with which he w as char g d
or tliat they were not criminal ; or that in
could not be held refponlible for them ; 01
that, if refponlible, the putiifhment coult
not justly, or even lawfully be greater ilia;
the depolition.
With refpetf to the affair of the ioth o
August, he argued, that the king had mad<
no preparation for the defence of his owi
palace ; that tlie constitutional magiilrate
were with him, and that one of thole reae
the article of the law which authorized tin
cp;>ofition of force to force ; that whe:
he was invited to the Aflembly, he wen
there, and that the battle did not com
mence till an hour afterwards. It hac
been said by many deputies in the conven
tion, that tin y had allilled in producing the
events of that day : If then, they had beer
premeditated, how could Louis be accufei
of them? Louis, who had never given :
sanguinary order; who, at Varennes, chose
rather to return a captive than to expose
the life of one man ; who, on the 20th ol
June, refufed every fort of defence, ;.n<>
chose rather to remain alone in the midtl
ot his people?â Louis, of whom history
would be heard to fay, that during a reign
of twenty years he had borne only an ex
ample of manners, justice and oeconomy ?
who had abolilhed fervi.ude in his do
main) ; who, when the people wilhed so:
liberty, gave it to thejiy?
There was here fomo.snurnmr ; but the
counsel went through fevt ral other articles
of the acctifatory act, Wnich.it is lef, ma
terial to notice here, and admonilhed the
convention that history would judge their
judgment.
At the conclusion of the speech Louis
rof; and said, " Citizens, the means of my
defence have been just expofeel to you ; 1
hull not resume them. In fpeaknig- to
you. perhaps, for the last time, I declare
that my co science reproaches me with
nothing. My defenders have said only the
truth.

OINCE my last, the inflructions given by
0 the Prelident to the Secretary of the
Treal'ury, and two laboured apologetic
performances of his, have made their ap
pearance. Matter thickens upon the pub
lic. Ihe frivolity with which the Secre
tary affetted to treat the fubjetf in hisfirft
letter, feeins to have fublided into fad and
forrowf'ul earnestness.
And there is in truth good reason for his
folicitudeand anxiety. That monarchical
adrruniirration, which he hath evidently a
dopted for the government of the United
Spates, is threatened by sundry portents.
The vanity of this pretended Atlas, has
certainly Simulated him into an arrogant
.idea, that the rights of the continent reli
ed solely on hiinfelf. For a consciousness
Â«t refponfibiiity only, could induce him to
wander into a laboured defence of the
laws ior making foreign loans; and into a
fnamelefs acknowledgment of having afi'u
med powers exclusively entrusted to the
Prefiaent.
Nor ought the indecency, with which
through seventeen pages of sophistry, he
compiles hard thought of motives for his
own direction and application of the loans,
with scarcely an alluiion to the personage
exclnlively entitled by law to direct and ap
ply, and without even the decorum of an
apology, to escape animadversion.
Several resolutions have pulled the House
of Representatives, requiring a plain ftate
inent of public funds. Of w hat do these
funds conlift ? Of dollars and cents. How
can dollars and cents be comprehensibly
exhibited?' By figures. In a month, three
Statements appear, confilljng chiefly of so-
arguments: the. firft exhibiting
I ingerâthe second vanityâand the third
>rolixity and confterr.ation.
But the public funds are left in a state of
perplexity almost inexplicable, whilst those
of his own mind are exhausted in elFeeling
this great defidcratum.
Every man w ill admit, that the Secreta
i"y pofffTeS penetration enougK to know
'hat the community can derive but little
information ftonj these laboured perfor
mances ; but the idea ought to quicken
the public invefligation, as it obviously ac
knowledges a concealment.
This new exercise of fifcal evolution,
does however sometimes pitfe it the Se
cretary in attitudes, exhibiting his real
purposes ; the only difficulty L, to catch
the pofi ion before he a flumes a new fi
gure. Let lis attempt to fin-mount it.
And that this Proteus may not flip out of
our hands, it is belt to resort to figures.

From these figures, extrafled from se
veral returns, and brought to a point, it
seems difficult to discern the necessity for
borrowing this inftrumeiitality, in aid of
tie Jinkingfund. Let us try it another
way.

And on July the ii>, 1791, the cafn on
hand beyond every difhurfement, from the
fame resource, dols. 54 cents.
et the Secretary drew above a million of
dollars, of this fame injlrumentality, from
Holland in 1790 and.9l*.
Once more we will strive to discover a
reaion for it, by enquiring how matters
flood at the end of the year 1792. The
Secretary (fates the ballaiice thusâ
By excess oi income beyond
the actual difburfeir.ents of
the treasury to the end of the
year 1792 5,114,696. 50
This sum includes bonds, calh and loans.
Can this enormous accumulation of
funds be accounted for and diHipated, 1 v
the magvrs; to.ins " t:ijlnmentality a A
appropriation r"
I hits it appears that the revenue has
been continually accumulating from the
iingle resource of taxation.
At the end of 190, there
was a surplus in bonds and
ca "' 1,374,656. 40
At the end of 1791 of
At the end of 1 -92, inclu
ding 556,595 dols. 56 cent 3
of domeftif loans of 2,809,027. 37
And throughout this period ofconflaiit
accumulation, the Secretary has been as
conflantly drawing bills 011 Holland for
money borrowed there, to the amount,
including payments for interefl in Holland,
which is an indirect mode of drawing, of
above three million! of dollars, exchifive
of domestic loans.
The regular accumulation of our do.
mefiic resources flowed from two causes.
Firfl, from a surplus of revenue beyond
even the appropriations to the end of 1791,
of 952.765 dols. 93 cents. Secondly, from
furphjes of appropriations beyond the real
expenditure-
Hence, tho' this accumulation was mod
of it in bonds, yet as these were regularly
and monthly coming in during the follow
ing year, it constituted afur.dl'or anticipa
ting the annual revenue.
A confeioufnefs of this ir.riuccd the Se
cretary to invent the term. " inftrumcntal
ity," with the broad veil of which to cover
the enormous sum drawn from Holland
during the last two years. He had not
purchased public debt with itâand he
could not fi;:k it by anticipations. Accor
dingly he is obliged now to exhibit the mo
ney in the follow ing articlesâ.

This view of figures deir,onltrat<rs, that
infiruwentality does net mean payment!
and yet it also demonflrates the neceffitv of
the word, "lie Secretary, knowing the
checks refultirg from the figures he has been
obliged to fcairer about from time totiifi"
in his llatemen;s anil reports, ,if collected
to a point, couid rot venture to iini
money by anticipations, or the help of the
linking fucd. If this linv. pi fiance p!t;r-get! hini into a dilemma, it has alio exhibi
ted his adroienefs in extricating himfelf, by
puzzling others.
O.'.e diking fact will illustrate the fyf
teni ot tr<e Secretary : a! the begi.: ling oi
this year, he had compiud the enorraou:
Ann of 5,114,696 dollars 50 cents, in bonds,
bills a.id cacti. A fuai more than fiiiQcien:
to defray the whole annual expenditure 02
the nation. A great loss of interelt muli
have resulted from this management ; foi
regular periodical loans have been maki
for more than two years, 111 order to col
lect this aggregate. Some of these iiave
been made 01' tlie banks, the depository oi
all the calli, thus conltantly collecting. At
allin>~ne):ts the banks have polltÃ'ed a
iargar Jan of public money than. hat!:
been burrowed of them, and at this mo
ment are reported to pofiels among
thejji tlie fijni-flf 1,339,327 dols. cents o!
aa: al cit?.', excluding 614,59.5 dols. 2 cents,
due for bills, of which the-banks have had
til? negotiation. And even at this moment
tire public are paying inter, it to the bank
of the United States 03 a loan of 400,00 c
dollars.
Is this ceconomy ? Is this honesty ? It is
neither ; and yet I confefs that it is injlru
mentality. It is a:i i dlrumentality by
which ail influence may be gainedâit may
bo deposited in tlie banks, where thu' it is
a loiing ialrrumeiuality to the public, it
â will produce profit to llockholdersâand it
may b? used as a balis for accommodations
to favorites, without any apparent inter
vention of the Secretary.
When did a nation, until now, accumu
late a film before-hand, moltly by bor
rowing, equivalent to the whole expendi
ture of the current year ?
But an event yet more extraordinary
hath occurred. Congref. have aflenied tc
a clause in a bill, permitting 800,000 dol
lars to be borrowed of the bank ot the U
nitedStates. The neceflity for this, is in
ferred from an argument so contemptible
as to exhibit a symptom of that mfirttmen
tality, which is to be deprecated.
For, the unfatislied appropriations o.
part times, are admitted as a debit again,
this accumulation of real revenue, altho
these appropriations were originally con
jectural, and in mofl inltances are provec
demonftrably to be a C:\ ing. But the bal
lancing rtal cajii by / leas only, is in ths
secretarial stile.
The monlirou3 absurdity of such mea
sures and arguments, mult give them aj:
enigmatical appearance. But the riddle i:
eafdyfolved. Bank directors and flock
holders are not fcatrered fparfnn in thele
"giflaturc. They cou.itenance-and fuppori
jnifapplicatVons of public moneyâ.they im
pose taxes and-make loans to swell depo
fiwâtheytain L* *i â¢*>..Â»*
appropriations, to gain a fhrplus ttiad t
the public, but alive to tiiemfelvesâthey
approve the featuring public monies, so a:
to obviate all poflibility ofdeteciing a misap
plicationâand they support mif.inpropria
tions of public funds. And why? Becaufc
all these measures combine secretly, a:
well as avowedly, to in xeafe their private
funds at tile public expence.
Dilinterefted cjtizens, what do you ex

The bank and the bill-drawing fyfteni,

, came into exigence on the fame day. The
14th of December, 1790, you reported to
CongreUthe plan of a National Bank, and
; 011 the. 1 yh of December 1790, you com
menced (Mil-drawing.
On tMji 14th of July 1791, the fubferip
| tlons to'the bank were made. On that
day youfliad drawn bills upon Europe to
the amount of 556,000 dollars, of which
sum ,000 dollars had been actually paid
in Am:'erdain, on or before the 31ft ot
preceding, not one (hilling of which

this money, until some time in that quar

of September ; but neither he nor you
have d'ewed it expedient to name the

Qf June,four days preceding the fubferip
tion to the bank, you had of public money,
depo iri-rl in the bank of North America
the': ' 'ier sum of 4:8.100 dollars, and 17

quefted to declare, "that Mr. Pinckney
was not on that occasion, nor ever thought
of being a candidate as a senator ; and
that upon being spoken to,previous to the
eledtion, by some of his friends, he not on
ly pactively declared he would net be a
candidate, but expressly directed a num
ber of the members ol the legislature, that
if they saw his name up, as a candidate,
to ilrike it out âand that he was not, nor
ever had, the least with or thought at;

[From The MAIL.J
On Monday the 18th of February, tht
Judges of the Supreme Court of the Uni
ted States delivered their opinions upon
the important quellion that had been ar
gued before them for thirteen d^ysâviz
Whether an individual of any liate may
sue a Hate, or, the United States ; 01
whether the citizens of any one state, may
sue another state. 'I he Attorney-Gene
ral (Mr. Randolph) was employed on
behalf of the executors of a citizen of the
state of Georgia, who had left America
previous to the revolution, and removed to
Great Britain, after fettl ng a partnerlhip
account with two partners in trade, and
whose bonds he took for the balance due
him. After his deceafp, his executors,
on making application for payment, found
that those two persons who had given
their joint bond had been inimical to the
cause of liberty in the United Sates, and
that their property was confifcated. '1 he
executors, alledging that the |>ond was
given previous to the revolution, applied
to the state of Georgia foi relipf. It then
became a matter of dispute, whether
those executors, being ci'izens of South-
Carolina, could sue the state of Geo.
rgia. An ailion was instituted in the
United States Circuit Court of Georgia,
and a verdict obtained in behalf of the
plaintiffs, but removed by a writ of demur
rer to the Supreme Court of the United
State 6 ; and after being argued for several
â Jays by the Attorney-General of the U
nitrd Statts, and Mr. Dallas, who was em
ployed against him, the five Judges, as we
have already mentioned, on Monday de
livered their opinions. Judge Iredell's o
pinion was againll the doctrines advanced
by the Attorney-General; but the Chief
Jll ft ice, Mr. Jay, Judge Cufliing, Judge
Wilson, and Judge Blair were of an op
posite opinion, and confirgicd tftat of the
Attorney-General, which fixes a molt
material and rational feature in the judici
ary of the United StatesâThat ev- ry in
dividual of any state has the natural privi
lege of suing either the United States ot
any (late whatever in the Union, for re-
dress, in all cases where he can prove a
iuft claim, a loss, or an injury having been
sustained, and viceversa.
Communications from Correspondents.
A writer in the Gazette of the UniteJ
States, of last Wedncfday, complains that
" a certain Gazette'' appears to him for
all the world like a Tar KelticâMerely
(it is fnppofcd). on account of that Gazette
being at all times open to free discussion
on all questions, and from all parties,but by
no means excluding such pieces as have a ten
dency to fmole out the gnats and infeÃs r f aris
tocracy and monarchy from these territories.
A burnt child, (not only the tar burnt)
always dreads the fire : and probably a tar
kettle, a mop, and a coat of plumes might,
in 1775 have been to this pcrfon, an equal
objeS of terrific apprehension.
The aftonilhing successes of the French
nation in afierting and vindicating the na
tural and political rights of mankind in
Europe, has evidently thrown a fettled
scowl of haggard and disconsolate tmlan
choly over the visages of the enemies of
those general rjghts in this country. Ho
ping Itill, however, to carry their favourite
point by hypocrisy, and finding it necef
fary to yield in some small degree to the
irrefillible torrent of the times, tlie thin
veil of republicanism is afTumed. Even
certain writers (noted (ticklers for Titles)
in the Hartfoid papers, begin to compli
ment themselves with the appellation of
â¢ Republican,"and"we republicans",in some
of their late writings "we apples (said
the hprfe tâds, as they were floating a
long in company vvith the apples) how
pleajantly do we ftuim !"âThe application
is easy.âMay they be converted from
their error,and befaved.
It is wished, that with the general de
molition of useless and unmeaning titles,
that of reverend may be laid aside by they
clergy of all denominations. A moment's
conlideration of the real import of this
word will demonflrate the impropriety of
its use. In days of old when the clergy of
papal Europe (with whom the appellation
originated) were little better than a kind
of inquisitorial aids-de-camp to civil defpo
tilm, and closely linked ill with civil po
licy, the better to tyrannise over the peo
ple, the individuals of the clerical body
might properly enough have been flyled
reverend, as being objects of aweful-dreati
and servile veneration. This, indeed, and
this only, is the real idea comprehended in
the word, derived from the latin, revereor,
i - e. " to (land in awe," or " be greatly
afraid of"âilly adapted indeed, to a poor
frail mortal, whose breath is in his nostrils
and himfelf transient as the grass of the
field ! â Render unto Ctfar the things that
are Cefar's, and unto God the things that
are God's ; and let those, who would be
thought wife, not arrogate to themselves
the fearful- attributes of divinity
Titles among men, if at all jultifiable, can
only be so on the principle of rational re
fpe3, and not of blind adoration.
