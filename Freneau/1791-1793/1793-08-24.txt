of France were atfefled ;âthere has been
much unnecefi'ary, a:id even tirefoine de

A TRAVELLER.
From the General Advertiser
rpHE late capture at sea, on her pallage
-*â  from New Orleans to Philadelphia, ot
the vcffl'l built on the Ohio, witllin the
ll.ite of Prnnfylvania, owned by citizens ol
the United States, and whofecargo belong
ing to American citizens, conii::s in pro
ductions of the growth of this country, de
inoultrates the evident necoflity of a treat j
with Spain, refpeiting the navigation ol the
jYliffii'ppi.
It is a matter of fact, that the lands oi
the wedern country are much more luxu
riant and fertile than tho-'e of the Atlantic
parts of the United States ; it will follow
then that western cultivated landd will af
ford a larger proportion of produce for
exportation than the fame quantity of
cultivated lands on the ealterti fid? oi the
mountains ; but when we take also into
conlideration, that no.t of the wellern
inhabitants are farmers, thnt there are but
few mschanics among them, and that they
have no large towns to fnpply, we will
readily admit that the proportion of theit
produce for foreign market mud be ft'jl
greater. It is very true that the popula
tion of the weflern country is inconlidera
bl?, comparatively with the vast extent of
that territory ; yet the number of its inha
bitants is respectable, and defervedoubtlefs
the attentiwii of the lupreme legislature oi
the Union. The slate of Pennfvlvania has
feÂ»eral populous counties beyond the moun
tains, whose produce must go to market b)
the Alleghany and Monongahela rivers
.down the Ohio and Miffifippi. Virginia is
in the famelituation, as to herpoflelfions or
the Ohio and Great Kanhaway rivers. Tilt
fiate of Ketituckey, which is far from be
ing contemptible for the number of het
inhabitants, has no other way to export
v her produce. The territory north well
of the Ohio, comprehending the several
settlements of Scioto, Miami, Wabafh, and
the villages and country of the Illinois,
ill the very fame predicament : and lalily,
the territory south of the Oli'o, containing
upwards of 50,000 fouls, lies altogether on
the weflrern waters, and is more conveni-1
fitnated than all the others to the na
vigation of the Miffilippi. At a mode
rate calculation then, w- may well elti
maie half a million of people, modlv far
mer, who can export none of their pro
duce, but through the channel of the Mif
iilippi. So great a part of the nation ought
not and cannot much longer be negtefted.
The preterded exclnfive right of S'pa'n
to the navigation of the Miffifippi.Ufotliiri*d
on no principle of equity or natural justice.
â Thalia country of more extent than any
of the kingdom ol Europebe debarred of
its natural right of fendi ig its produce to
sea, because Spain happens to have a small
town with a few filbjects hear the mouth ol
the Miffilippi ? Ho'.v long will Americans
fubinit to the oppreflion of paving, a hea\)
and degrading tribute to a Spanilh officer,
for a license (In his power ever to deny)

duce ? ar.d kinder the rellriftion of mik
ing Inch veflels Spailifh bottoms, which
fubjeils them to be feizable by the armed

tion these arbitrary proceedings of Spain
placeour w edern i itizeHs ! If they will) t<
export their produce, they mult not onh
snake life of the mod hurtrlilt folicitatiom
but they are compelled besides to piy a
very high duty for the permilfion of failing
nut of the M liifippi under the colours of a
foreign nation at war with our allies.â
How degrading fnch reft rittions ! how

It is easy to forefee w hat willbe the con
equence, if a treaty be not soon, and very

"pHRRE is 110 kind of folly that satire
hath fadened tij'on with a keener
:oolh, than foppery. There i- scarce avir
:ue, which hath been more highly extolled
:tiati magnificence. It is natural, there
rore, to luppofe, that the noble receptior
lllowcd to the lad, has been the bait ti
educe such numbers into the lirfl ; â¢ and
t-et there is 110 more similitude between
.hem, than between paint and beauty.
The very elfence of the ridiculous is af
"eftiition ; nor would the owl and ass bo
reated so ludicruudy, as they always are,
f, overtheir natural dulnefs, they did not
ivear the malk of w ifdoni. As-Sancho fa
;acioufly declares, we a r e all as God made
us ; and, therefore, while we continue a:
ive are made, we ;.re no way obnoxious tc
jlame or laughter, for not being what vc
ivere never intended to be.
But common sense is not ful to the
u ill of kings, and challenges a prerogative
fupcrior to theirs.
Hence it w as, that even a diadem col-Jtl
not cover the ass-ear; ot Midas ; throng!:
that dazzling circle they beti ,--ed them,
[elves, and every sycophant who approach
ed him, laughed in his sleeve, if not in his
sovereign's face.
Had his ailinine majefty /lever slept into
the judgment-feat, and underteek to be e
man of tade, he had never fallen under the
displeasure of Apollo, or been ear-mark
for tjie ridicule Â«f all ages.
I' have ever been particularly pleafec
with Ovid, for having played off this plea
fant piece of revenge upon a king : it ha*
i'erved to illultrale molt effectually, that ii
kings are gods in power, they are men in
judgment; and if mod of th'fe date idols
had not been vilited, like Ahab and Aga
memnon, with a lying spirit, it might pos
sibly have kept them from trel'palfing on
their own abilities, and afpiringto be ridi
cnlous.
But power intoxicates, as well as wine,
and the phrenzy it creates, seldom evaps
rates, but iu the deep of death.
Thus Alexander himfelf. though perhaps
(he molt magnanimous of men, i idiculouf
ly enamoured wi'h the charafler of Achil
les, set iip the poet's phantom as his moiiel
in all thing*. Hepheltion thits became his
Patrocltis, and was lodged in his bol'dm,
rather perhap . throfigh affectation, pardon
the )ingle, than affection. Thus, likewise.
he piqued himfelt on being fu Ift of foot;
as also oi his own ptrfonal valonr, and the
giving a fr:e loose to the moll violent ot
liispallion Â»â¢ And lallly, fitch strength did
this vain glorious humour of his acquire
by longiiululgence, that, not fatisfied with
the red! glory he had acquired by his victo
ry's, lie took pains to biall the reputation
nf both his parents,in orderto be elteemed
the son of J.. piter.
In all 11jtie lights, aslikewife irt his
weeping for more worlds to conquer, a c
tvillas his ambition to excrl all rneji in all
things, even Alexander himfelf becomes as
?rtlineiTtly ridiculous, as, eiilulive of his
'â¢'< Hies, he iva3 eminently worthy of admi
ration.
The affixations and obfurditles of A!ex

:he Achilles he mm it Iced was the Achilles

" On the morning of the (7th of July,
vn failed from Cape-Frai 5. >is in rdmpaii)

brotigbt to by an aimed sloop, and did no
perceive that lhe Ihewed any coloursâhet
boat boarded us with a number of armec
nen and took pofllflion of our vefl'el, the)
told us the privateer was from Jamaica
commanded bv David Harris, called the
Joseph and Mary, and mounted 8 guns.
Oil the fallowing day their boat came or
board again, they broke open our hatche
ard fore scuttle, and took out a conlider-
part of our cargo, u hicli were hides.
Kot finding any thing to render our
suspicious of being French property, :h?y
int rhp hides down again and clo ed our
hatches,fome oftheinhowever wc e dan a
ged in consequence of the ffea that v as th 1
running. Hiving 18 French pafl'engers or
board, they broke open tlieir trunks and
took all the money, plate and jewels they
could there find. The capt .in of the pri
vateer feeing a fail, gave chact to her, and
ordered us to follow after him, he foor
came up with and took her : she proved tc
be the vefTel we had failed in company witl
from the Cape, and had ijo French pas
senger on board. On the 20:h, they a'-
choiedusboth at that wild and uninha
bited place called Great H-'neaga. Th j
proceeded to search our vefl' l again, re
ex'. nined the trun'cs, not excepting the
captain's, tore up the after cabbin floor and
botiom of the lower births Having now
taken all the money, p'ate afid jewels the;
could find, besides live ne*gro girls and fom
small articles, and hiving drank moll "t
the pafT-ngers wine, they gave us a dif
cliarge, with orders to depart immedi
ately. We bad 110 sooner got underway,
t'lan a person bythe name o f A inias Mac
Dougal, came on board ; he commanded
a fohooner privateer from New-Provi
<le;ice, called the Brothers, mounting ic
guns. He roared like a madman, and too:
poffelfion of the vcflel : upon beina a Iked
by what authority he did it, he answered
in the following manner : ' I do not choose
to fliew every one my authority, when
your vefTel is along fide of my guns I ma>
doit.' The captain then Ihewed him the
discharge he had received from the othei
privateer, he said he did not care a damn
for it, he had often got good picking- out
of others leavings, tlren ordered his boat
off for twenty men with loaded guns and
cutlafl'es, part of which soon after came
armed as ordered. We were now taken
close under our captttrer's guns, and seve
ral other privateers whicn appeared to be
in concert.
" On the succeeding day, our hatches
were once more broke open, and our car
go taken out to the dunnage. Our water
calks were scuttled, and about 500 dollars
tal'en out of them, which our French
pafl'engers had there secreted. We were
now once more released. Our paflengers
101 l none of their cloaths, exc. pt a few
handkerchiefs ; Capt. F-anning loft a hat,
â which one of our people saw oil the head
of the prize-mailer of the Joseph and Ma
ry, when 011 board of her. which he in the
, presence of the captain allied for, but they
refufed to return it. In the evening of the
day we failed from Heneaga we were
spoke with by the said Ananias M,Dougal,
who informed us, that he in company with
live other privateers had taken the Ame
rican (hip called the Harmony, belonging
to Baltimore, and on thefncceding day we
saw them anchor her ander Atkins Key."
We fearri from a Norfolk paper, that a
16 gun (hip of war had arrived-at St. Kitts
in 26 days fro.n Liverpool, with the intel
ligence that peace was eflabliflied between
France and England. What gives feme
degree of probability to this news, is, the
total inability, as well as inactivity of
Holland, in prosecuting the war ag inll
J'rance; the Spaniards near ly a -inactive;
England left to support nearly the whole
expence of the league, and the combined
powers discouraged, their fubjefts on the
point of revolt, and their united force not
able to drive even Outline out of Germany.
Intelligence is received from England,
through the Ã¼bove channel, that Mr. Fox
had resigned his- feat in parliament, on
which occalian the friends of liberty h tl
set a subscription on foot for him, and al
ready raised 40,01101. A number of addi
tion.d failures hail taken place in London,
B: litol, &c. as also in Scotland, and the

Poison Tree, in the IJl >nd of Java, in
the jt.ajl Indies, By a Gentleman xaho
resided many years in th it place.
DESCRIPTION, <bc.
INJava'sifle, midst circling mountains
plac'd
The Bohon Upas casts his deadly (hade ;
With poifiHlous Iteanis, this tyrant oi the
watte'
Tai:it3 the warm air and bids all nature
fade.
Each beast of prey. each bird of loftieft
flight,
m,!ii himfelf the deadly vapours seize,
Bind the clos'd eyelid in eternal night,
Quench the blue vein, or bid its current
freeze.
THIS tree grows in the Dutch island
of Java, in the Eait Indies, and
renders a vast extent of country round it,
noxious and sickly by its vapours. The
following account of this extraordinary
tree, which is found in no other part of
the world, is extracted from a letter writ
ten by a gentleman of information and
veracity, a furgt-on by profetiion, whore
Tided many years at Batavia, in the island
of Java.
" In the year 17*74, I was Rationed at
Batavia, as a surgeon in the frrvice of the
Dutch Eatt India company. During my
residence there I received several differ
ent accounts of the Bohon Upas, and the
violent effects of its poison. They all
then seemed incredible lo me, but.raised
my curiosity in so liigh a degree, that I
resolved to inveltigate this iwbjeft tho
roughly, and to trust only to my own ob
fervations. In cottftquence of this reso
lution 1 applied to the governor general
for a pass to travel thro' the country â
My requell was granted, and having pro
Cured every information, I Â£et out 011 my
expedition. I had procured a recommen
dation from ah old Malayin priest to an
other priest:, who lives on 'he nearest ha
bitnblefpot to the tree, which is about 15
or 16 miles d ill ant. The letter proved of
great service to me in my undertaking, aS
that priest is appointed by the emperor to
reside the e, in order to prepare for eter
nity the fouls of those who, fo.r different
crimes, are fentenc-d to approach the tree
and to procure the-poifon.
This malignant tree grows about 27
leagues from Batavia. It is surrounded
on all fides, by a circle of high hills and
mountains, and tile country round it, to
the dill ant of ten or twelve miles from the
tree is entirely barren : Not a tree, not a
' shrub, nor even the lead plant or grass is
to be fcen. I have made the tour all
around his dangerous spot, at about 18
miles distant from the centre,>.nd I found
the afpe.n of the country on all fides
Â«q ially dreary. The winJs are for the
mod part hot and sultry, at other times
the atmosphere is calm and fuffocating,
and every thing around wears the appear
ance of dejedtion, death&melancholy. The
eafielt ascent of the hills is f om that part
where the old ecclesiastic 1 wells. From
his hcufe the criminals are sent for the poi
son, into-which the points of all the war
like instruments arc cipped It is of high
value, and produces a considerable revenue
to the Indian emperor of the interior regi
ods of the island.
The peiion which is procured from this
tree, is a gum that iflues constantly out
in abundance between the baik .md the
tree itfelf, like the camphire. M ilefac
tors, who for their crimes are sentenced tc
die, are the only persons who fetch the
poison, and this is the only chance they
have of saving their lives After sentence
as pronounced upon them by the judge,
they are alked in court, whether they will
die by the hands of the executioner, 01
whether they will go to the Upas tree sot
a ' *of poison J
Th;y commonly prefer the latter pro
pi 1 1, as there is not only some chance ol
preserving their lives, but also a certainty,
in cafe of their fafe return, that a provision
will be made for them in future by the
emptror. They are also permitted to ask
a favour from the emperor, which is gen
erally of a trifling nature, and commonly
granted. They are then provided with a
silver or tortoise fhellbox, into which they
are to put the poisonous gum, and are pro
perly inttru&ed how to proceed, while they
are upon their dangerous expedition. A
mong other particulars they are always
told to attend to the diredtion of the
winds, as they are to go towards the tree
fcÂ«fore the wind, so that the effluvia from
die tree Sre always blown from them.
They are told, likevvife, to travel with the
titmoft dispatch, as that is the only me
thod ef enluring a fafe return. They arc
afterwards sent to the house of the oIJ
pried, to which place they are commonly
attended by their friends and relations
Here they generally remain foine days, in
expe&ation of a favourable breeze. Du
ring that time the etclefiadic prepares
them for their future fate, in the eternal
world, by piayer6 and admonitions.
When the hour of their departure ar
riv.s, the pried puts over their heads a
long leather cap, with tvo glaflcs before
their eyes, which comes d wn as far a;
their breail ; and also provides them vvit'i
a pair of leather gloves. They are then
condn&ed by a guard, attended by the
pried,and their friends and relations, about
two miles on their journey. Here the
pried repeats his indruftions, and tel's
:htm where they are to look for the tree.
He shews them a hill, which they are told
to ascend, and that on the other fide they
will find a rivulet, which they are to fol
low, and which will conduct them dire&ly
:o the Upas. They now take leave of
?ach other, and amidd prayers for their
r uccefs, the criminals haflen away.
The worthy old ecclefiadic has allured
cne, that during his residence there, for
ipwards of 30 years, he had difmified
\bove seven hundred criminals in the manner
which I have described, and that scarce
y two out of twenty have returned. He
shewed me a catalogue of all the unhappy
ufferers, with the date of their departure
r rom his house annexed, and a lift of the
:ffences for which they had been con
demned. To which were added the named
as those who ha I returned in fafety. 1
lfterwards saw a lift of those culprits, at
he jail keeper's at Sotira Charta, and found
hat they perfe&ly corresponded with each
3ther, and with the different infoimativms
which I afterwards obtained.
1 was present at some of those meian
:holy ceremonies and desired different
Criminals to bring with them some pieces
if the wood, or a final! branch, or some
eaves of this wonderful tree. I have also
jiven them silk cords, defuing them to
ir.eafure its-lhickncfs. I never could pro
;ure more than two dry leaves, that were
picked up by one of them on his return ;
md all I could learn from him concerning
he tree itfclf was, that it dood oÂ» the
borders of a rivulet, as described by the
jld priest, that it was of a middling fizÂ»,
"another account fays eight feet in circum
'"erence near the ground, and about ninety
Fe t high] ;:nd that five or fix young trees
:>f the fame kind, dood close by it ; but
:hat no other 111 rub or plant could be seen
n its neighbourhood ; and that the ground
:onlided of a brownifli sand, full of pebble
Hones of a flinty kind, almod impractica
ble for travelling, and covered with bleach
id bones and dead bodies.
After many conversations with the old
Malayan pried, I rpeftioned him about the
fird discovery, and alked his opinion ol
this dangerous tree; upon which he in
formed me, that above one hundred years
igo, the country round the tree was beau
tiful and verdant, but inhabited by a race
i>f people drongly addidted to the fins of
Sodom and Gomorrah : when the great
departed prophet Mahomet, incensed that
they led such detedable lives, applied to
God to punish them : upon which God
eaufed this tree to grow out of the earth,
which destroyed them all, and rendered
the country forever uninhabited.
Such was the opinion and creed of the
Malayan priest. I fliall not attempt a
:omment, but must observe that all the
Malayans consider this tree as an holy in
(lrument of the great prophet to punifli
the fins of mankind, and therefore to die
if the poison of the Upas is generally con
sidered among them as an honourable
death. For that reason I also observed
that the criminals who were going to the
tree, were generally dressed in their bed
ipparel.
This however is certain, though it may
ippear incredible, that from 15 to lb
niles round this tree, not oaly no human
:reature can exist, but ill that space of
ground, no living animal of any kind has
ever been difeovcred. I have also been
allured by several persons of veracity, that
there are no fifh in the waters, nor has any
r -t. mouse, nor any o.her vermin been
seen there ; and when any birds fly so near
his tree that the effluvia reaches them,
hey fall a f.crificeto the effedts of the
poison. This fircumftar.ce has been as
cettatned by different criminals, who, in
their return, have fc:n the bir<3a drof
down, and have picked them up dead, and
brought tl.em to the old eccieiiallic. I
'."ill here mention an instance which provet
this fact beyond all doubt, and which hap
pened during my stay at Java. âIn the
year 1775, a rebellion broke out amor.g
Ihe fubjefts of the Mafiay, a fovereigir
prince whose dignity is nearly equal to
that of the emperor: They refufed to
pay a duty imposed upon them by their
lovereign, whom they openly opposed.
The Mafiay sent a body of a thousand
troops to disperse the rebels, and to drive
them with their families, out of his do
minions. '1 hus 4.00 families, confiding ol
above 1600 fou!s, were obliged to leave
their native country. Neither the empe
ror nor the sultan would give them pro
tection, not only because rhey were rebels,
but also thro' fear of di pleasing their
neighbour, the Mafiay. In this dillrefsfr.!
situation, tlicy had no other rcfource thar
to repair to the uncultivated parts around
the Upas, and requeued permission of the
;mperor to fettle there. Thisrequeft was
granted on condition of their fixing theii
lbode not more than 12 or 14. miles from
the tree, in order not to deprive the inha
hitants already fettled there, at a greater
â¢-i'd a nee, of-their cultivated lands. Wit!
this they were obliged to comply : bin
the confequsnce was, that in less than twe
months their number was rednced to abotn
500. The chiefs of those who remained.
l eturned to the Mafiay, informed him oi
their loflVs, and intreated his pardon, which
induced him to receive them again as his
fubjeft.=, thinking them ftifficiently punish
ed for their mifconduft. I have seen and
coriyerfed with fever .1 of those who fur
vived, soon after their return. They al
had tile appearance of persons tainted with
an infjftious disorder ; they looked pale
a- d weak, and from the account which
they gave of the loss of their comrades, ol
the fymptomsand circumstances which at
tended their difiolution, such as convjl
fions, and other ligns of a violent death,
I was fully convinced that they fell victims
to the poison.
