The following AddreSs to the Public on thefub
jc&. of rendering Shingles incoml vfiible, by Capt
John ?.lacpherfon.- is reprintedfrom the Fed
era! Gazette of May at the requefi nf tha
gentleman.
Ir is some time Since I invented amethoc
to prevent honfes from being burnt
Nor could a house, prepared a; I (hall di
rect, be burnt, though fleaks Â«f fire fell or
it: and it was covered with fliingles. /
multiplicity of other matters, pre\ ented mi
publishing it as soon as I intended. Bu
lately feeing an ac ount of the fire at Mar
blehead, made me sorry I had not publifiiec
it sooner, and determined me to do it a
soon as poflible ; the expenfeis trifling, anc
houses so prepared, are not only fecarec
from fire, but will extinguish any fire tha
falls on them.
The method to preserve houses from fire
i-. es follows : Let every piece of timber
before it is put on a building, be firSt foakec
in Strong brine for three weeks. This ma)
be done at a small expense, as troughs ma;
be made large ar.d Jong enough, to admi:
the longest piece of timber used about :
ho life. I think fix such trotigh" would bf
fufficient for a larger city than any in Ame
rica, though building as fact as we now arc
doing. How long they would last, lan
sure no man can tell. Indeed it appears tc
me they never would decay, if kept full oi
pickle. When such troughs are filled wit!
fhingies, and weights put on to fink them,
little more pickle will be wanted lor a long
time, as the sap and every watery particle
Will be expunged by the brine, which will
ta'-e pofitfliou of every pore, and when
brine has got that pofleffion, I believe it can
not be dispelled by any thing, not even bv
quicksilver, (though this I have never tried
{am sure fire cannot; for 1 funka piece oi
Slave, and a piece of {hing'.e in a bowl oi
Strong pickle fourteen days, then, dried
them in the fun ; I afterwards put them
where there was a considerable draught of
air, thin put burning coals-on them ; they
did not burn but e'Ktinguifhed the fire. I then
put them on the parlour fireâthey near
ly cxtiugn:ilied that, but were not burnt.
Houses .Ircady Ihingled, as it would be
expenlive to uncover them, and prepare the
fliingles, a i firft directed, I believe, if blank
ets were steeped in Strong brine, and spread
over the roof, and frequently wet with
brine tram a watering paa, and that me
thod contjjiiu -i till the under psrt of the
{luigles tafred Salt to thetongue, it Would
Save many lives, houses &c.
By this method houses would last much
longer than they now do, and their inhabi
tants, especially in inland parts, preserve
better-health than they now do, a: the air
in iioufes thus prepared would be iomething
Similar to sea air. Water will in time dif
foive fait; therefore it would be prudent,
ai ter long rains, to sprinkle roofs with brine

THEdiviiions in tlie court of theStachhol

sionary redouble, and as several courtiers

Lmidin, April 22. Sofr.e of the advocates
for all forts of eftablilhed power, and all
kinds of prescriptive abuse, complain of
whatfhey are pleased to call the criminal
upir.enefs of government in negleÂ£ting to
crush by the ftronghapd of authority those
whofugtre.it the expediency, or maintain
the right of co.-resting the inherent defects,
or repairing the breaches that time has
made in the .iritilh conflitution. These
gentlemen forget that altho'the excise is in
rull vigour, the Jlar-chambcr is not yet re-
Itored, and that miliilters cannot exert an
authority which they d.Q not pollefs.
His holiness ti:e Pope lias iflued several

The r.aron Bielke, Secretary to the late
king of Swede::, was one of the foremoft in
perpetrating his death. After being ap
prehended, he confeffed the cfime but ad
ded he had taken cace to prevent the pu
nilhment preparing for him, and the riik oi
being compelled by torture to betray thofc
who had joined him in a plan to delivei
Sweden from a tyrant. He soon after ex
pired in consequence of poison he had fvval
lowed. The next day his body was drawn
on a hurdle, conduced by the executioner
and the officers of justice to the place wh:re
malefactors aire exposed to public view.â
\ detachment of dragoons escorted the
proceSon.
That two men (the Emperor of Moroc
co and his brother) Ihould destroy each o
ther in a contelt for tyrannic sway, wbuld
in any other country except Morocco, leac
the people to try if they could not emanci
pate themselves from the fetters witl
which they have been lb long galledâbui
this unhappy race have not yet learned t(
think. It was the opinion of Helvetius
thÂ»: the world, being enslaved as it is bj
prejudices, would soon rid itfelf both oi
delpotifln and fuperftitibn if a few bold,
leading truths- were set -on the wing, auc
defended as they ought to be, by a" final
number of men of virtue, independence
and refolistion.
Ail attempts to carry into execution the
plans ot the Empress of Russia, in Sweden
lriuft now b. laid afule ; and lo far not oa
ly the French, but the Englilh, are deliver,
ed from an imminent embarraflme'nt.âAi
the time of the king ofSweden's death, the
Ruffians had 27 ihips of the line actuallj
ready ior sea. The Swedes were to fur
ni!h lix, and the king was to have com.
manded a body of troops, for the double
purpose of an attack on France, and o
forming a Ruffian settlement in the Medi
teranean âan object which the
court couid not contemplate with indif
ference.
The catafhophe of the king of Swedei
ought to open the eyes of kings. In tin
hands of the people, even when they me
rit indignation, kings are not exposed t<
violence or to inlidious' machination âbu
indignant nobles do not treat potentate
wit a equal indulgence : and, without opei
remittance, meditate infernal designs, whicl
are carried into execution without regarc
to morality, to religion, or to those princi
pies of humanity which are infeparablt
trom the colleitive body of every people
chat has emerged from barbarism. One
criterion of the present times seems to be
that in most of the European nations
the great body of the people are illuminat
ed, and are manifeftly progressive, while the
"uperior orders, the noblelie, &c. move re
trograde in every line of human excellence
Perhaps, the peers of the British nation maj
byfomebe an exception to the general fj f.
tern- and if the prerogative of the crown hac
not been extended under the present ad
ministration, to an unprecedented pitch,
the houl'e of peers might have appeared ai
this aira in ail their glory. But the blow
which was aimed at the conltitution of thi:
country in the year 1784, hasfunkus in the
I'cale of nations ; and it is allowed by the
molt enlightened politicians, that in 110 pe
riod, lince the revolution, was the influ
ence bf the crown so alarming in this coun
try, from the creation of peers; from the
application of the public revenue, as the
medium of corruption; from the impress oi
ieamen, in frivolous armaments, and from
Inch an extenfioa of the excise laws, and
every other species of oppression, as would
have been reliiled with a iyitematic oppo
litionin former times, which must have
lhaken the executive government, or hur
led deftruaion on the responsible adminif
tiation. Confidence is a new phraseology
unknown to a tree country, when confi
dence, in ministers is at variance with ra
tional conviction. Jealousy is the princi
ple which produces and maintains every
tree government ; and until an equal re
presentation of the people forms the legifla
uire, the term confidence, when applied to
any exilti.jg administration, is an insult to
the human underltanding.
Paiis, April 20. Since the decree pro
lcribing all clerical habits, out of church, fevâ
era]l biiliops have gone to the alfembly in
di els coats, and with bags to their hair.
That decree is not the least important pas
sed by the present legifiatiye body. It is a
deep and dreadiui blow to' fuperltition, of
which the vulgar ever received more by the
eyes than by the ears. That it is deemed
so by the pnefthood, and other avowed
enem.es to the conltitution, is proved bv
their rage, on occasion offt change o? garb,
which would otherwise be a matter of so
much indifference ; but they plainly per
ceive, that they have lolt their molt power
ful engine of imposture.

Captainjofeph Brandt, the principal war
rior chief of the Six Nations of Indians, ar
rived in this city 0:1 Wednesday evening
lafU it is said his errant is a visit to a num
ber ofhis acquaintance residing here, and
to pay his respects to the Preiident of the
United States.
Accounts from Cape Francois are Yeceiv
ed to the third of June. At that time there
was not the least appearance of the re-esta
blishment of peace, or of any succour to the
white inhabitants, and every day exhibited
fre(h scenes of devaluation. Twenty fami
lies came in the vefiel that brought these ac
counts.
On th& 14thinft. Gen. Anthony Wayne,
reached Pittlburgh. On entering the town
he was saluted by a discharge of the artille

The National Aflembjy of France have
determined to adopt the general principle
of the abolition of the (lave-trade ; that is
they have resolved to proceed in exact con
formity with other nations in effecting Â£
complete abolition of so infamous an abuse
of commerce."
Editions of the French constitution, ir
seven or eight languages, are now printing
oft to a great extent in Paris, and these art
to be circulated, it is said, wherever the
v rench arnijes go ; a species of artillerj
more dangerous to despotism than the fire
of all the artillery in Europe.
MacauJey, the republican hiftoria'
of England, upon her death-bed recom
mended the writings of Mr. Paine to hei
children, as the belt model of their politica
creed.âlt is said a society is forming 11
England, to have Mr. Paine's political wri
tings printed in such a manner, as, in poin
of price, to render the pui chafe within ev
ery one'., ability, and todiftr'rbute the book
gratis to those whom the tyranny of govern
ment has rendered too poor to expenc
their mite.âQuere, are not Paine'* Right
of man entitled to something of the kind ii
America ? As to Mr. Burke's late writings
they might be printed in a more elegam
style, as being only read by the rich.
The following gentlemen were eleftec

Some have expressed their admiration at
the very considerable desertion of officers
from the French marine, in favor of the
emigrants. Such should recollect that na

cause they are convinced republican govern

they veryâ rationally conclude, that neither

monarchical government is,with these deep
reafoners,involved in the fame predicament.
According to Mr. Hume's theory the
money in every country represents all la
bour and vendible property ; increase the
money therefore, and you increase the por
tion of it which will represent the fame
portion of labour and property, that is to
fay you raise prices. As prices rife, other
nations will undersell the country in so
reign markets, and hence a diminution of
its exports ; whilst the high prices ,n its
own markets will not fail to augment its
imports, the balance of trade will in this
manner turn against it, and the redundant
money will overflow to countries where it
is scarcer 'till a proportional level takes
p ace every where. Since this proportion
a level of money cannot be denied gener
ally to exist, it may be asked on what
pt mciple it is to be accounted for, if it does
not proceed from the influence of plenty of
money on prices ?-and why a nation once
poflefied ot a favourable balance does not
by degrees draw to itfelfthe wealth of all
nations that trade with it P -It is answer
ed ; the effect afenbed by Mr. Hume to the
direfl and necessary influence of an increase
of money on prices ought to be ascribed to
its influence on demand and consumption,
on the taste and manners of those who puf
fers it. \\ ere an augmentation of nation
al coin to take place without augmenting
demand at all, the fuperfluous money would
eithet be locked up or converted into plate,
and no rife of prices nor efflux of money
would enfne, urlefs indeed it should be
lent to foreigners, in which cafe it would
on y go out to return in a greater quantity:
were it to augment demand but to augment
mdu tryin proportion, it is evident there
would be neither a rife of prices, nor a fu
perfluity of money : but should the augment
teuton of money excite demand and confump
trn, and these not excite indujlry in proportion,
the cafe would be different. As far as the
new demand beyond the national industry
might have for its object national produc-
wou a add to their price till the ad
dition should equal the expence of import
ing such articles, and a supply of the de'i
ciency from abroad vould occasion a pro..
pot tional efflux of money. As far as the
new demand might have for its object so
reign luxuries there would be a further efflux
oj money to pay tor them. From these new
importations the balance of trade wou'd
become unfavourable, and the money
w0,,1d continue to overflow to other pla
ces till the demand excited by its excels Should

A writer in the B oft on Independent Chroni
lie, after a number of feniibie observation;
on the present Indian war, takes occr'ior
to make the following remark : â" We
have indeed sent miflionariesto ihelndians,
to teach them religion ; and willing enough
are we that they should he faints, and go to
heaven that they may be oi:' of the way of
troubling tis, good folks, here itjon earth.â
Their having towns, or a state by tliem
felves, and being in connexion with us in
civil affairs, cannot allow.âOur con
duct has concluded this to be very impro
per. In fact some. have freely given their
opinions that not only their country, but
the world itfelf is not lai p;e enough to hold
Indians and white people too ; imlefs In
dians can live under the north pole, where
it is winter all the year."
After forae further animailverfions, he
goes on as follows : â " If we wish to have
peace with the Indians, under the consider.
ation of their being men, we-milft go a dif
ferent way to work with them, from what
we have hitherto gone. Our business in a
national view, is, not to convert them to
religion, but to civil life. Let them have
good religious inftruflion, and welcome;
bat national power is a civil thing, and can
only secure, or impart, civil blefTlngs to
mankind. Civilization being a national
object, is no more than a temporal matter ;
for although the light of moral and ration
al truth is neceflary to the reformation of
a barbarous people : yet, as a people, they
are reformed in no other view than being
brought to understand their natural rights.''

Capc Fraixcis, May 22 â26. Some de
structive fatality appears to pursue this co
lony to its titter detraction. While we
live, or r.ithcr while we expire under the
sword of our nffaffins, instead of uniting to
ward off the blow that isthreatened by our
enemies, we tamely consent to become their
victim , merely for the pleasure of feeing
each other deftroyrd. The enemy, it i.
well known, have taken an oath to each
other to destroy tiie white population of
the island ; so that we" arc i n fa.i executing
upon ourselves tliis execrable proscription.
It is ufeJef to difiemble any longerâthings

our ruin ; v..' 1 i!e nearly one half of our bre

warfare, or the diseases that attend it
Should we continue longer in our lethargy,
what a fpeflacle (hall we exhibit to the
worldâhow incredible will our conduct
appear.âlt is high time to emerge from
our slumbers, and bring ourselves to believe
that we have no resource but in ourselves,
and by uniting hearts, minds, and means,
to march cut against our enemies, conquer
them and punifl) themâwe are still a for
midable force against an army of cowardly
assassins, if only a union of hearts and cou
rage are our concomitantsâlet us recollect
that a single glance from a man of resolu
tion is death to a coward.âLet us keep a
steady eye upon the band of African rob
bers, and they will be either extirpated or
scattered âtheir legions will fly before us,
and the sword of the law fliall devour those
that escape that of war. âThen, and not till
then, will happiness return to St. Domingo,
and peace and prosperity will revisit iier
shoresâbut it we continue in petty quar
rels with each other, lurking in our houses,

so observable at the Cape, is the expectation
of the troops that have been so long promis

A committee of the Colonial Aflembly, about
the middle of May repotted a plan of a confli
tution for the colony. The papers received do
not gve a copv of it. The Assembly have be
gun to discuss its merits; but their proceedings,
owing to the reflridlioiis laid on theprels, do not
appear.
Some flir hasbeen made in the AfTembly, to
render its operation independent of the National
Affemblv, by rcprefenting that it has not the right
to repeal the confiitutional law of the 28th of
September, which tefpeQs the colonies ; and
that the Colonial Aifembly holding its powers as
the National Aifembly does, from the Conflic
ting Aifembly, will acknowledge no other law
as their guide 111 enacting those concerning the
interna! government of St. Domingo, than the
conllitution law of the 28th of September. It is
propoild to fubmi: to the King, for his approba
tion, their laws, in the fame manner as the Na
tional Aflembly. And also to draw up an ac
count of the decrees proposed and enaitedby the
conflituting ant legilbtivc Affemblies'relative to
-therolonies, wit'i observations to prove, that the
want of local knowled /â¢ in thoH: bodies, his not
a little contributed to blow up ibe ilime of dis
cord, and is one of the fir 0 caufesof tbe c'il ITIII -
tics fullered in St. Domingo;âthat the Nati
onal Allembly mav clearly fee the propriety of
leaving it to the colonies to enact the laws which
are to-govem ihemâwithout which power, the
colonies cannot exill.
Mr. a member of the Colonial As
fembly, propoled :o abolish perianal flnvery, and
to decree, as eflential to the exiflenceof fugarco
lonics, a fpccies ol slavery, binding the Have to
the foil. He also proposed regulations foibid
diurT the use of slaves for domeflic services, ; nd
to fill their places by hired freemen.â He repre
sented, in lupport of this plan, domestic slaves
as the cause of the present diflurbanees, from the
opportunities they had of feeing, heaving and
learning. He also infilled on the advantages of
encreafin ft the population of whites by this means
and thereby oppcling, with more force, any at
tempts of the negroesâa,.d on the p'rofpect of
a more careful culture, by restoring to the fuear
plantations ico,ooo working negroes. These
piopofuionsoi Mr. Favranges, who appear to be
an eloquent and influential member, were order
ed to lie on the table, to be taken up after the
completion of the confittution. The Aflembly
appears unanimously of opinion, that slavery in
u>me shape or other, is necefiary to the verv ex
illence of the ftigar colonies.

[From Mr. Paine's Rights of Man.']
THE befl conflitution that could now be
devlfcd, confident with the condition of the
present moment, may be far (hort of that
excellence which a few year's may afford.
There is a morning of reason riling upon
man on the fubjeet of government, that has
not appeared before. As the barbarilm of
the old governments expires, the
mor.il condition of nation with respect to
each other will be changed. ? <lati will not

would have believed, that a French jlat'pn

jealousy and ieroc' tv, which the govern

which they rendered fubfervient'to the purr
pose of taxation, is now yielding to the dic
tates of reafbn, i rile re ft and humanity. The
trade of courts is beginning to be under
iiood, and the affe&ai'ioii of myliery, with
all the artificial sorcery by which thcy'im

Government ought to be as much open
to improvement as any thing which epp'er
tains to man, infiead of which it has been
monopolized si cm age to age, by ;he mo'l
ignorant and vicious of tiie human race.
Need we any other proof of their w retched
management, than the excess of debts and
taxe with which every nation groans, and
the quarrels into which they have precipi
tated the world ?
Just emerging from ftich a barbarous con

Remarkable Curirfity.
THE mimickry, or imitative sports of

from the less perfeel to the more perfeSt,

Excijeman in Germantovvn, wasfecretlv dellioved
liuririg fit" nightâWhat proof does he bring for

officer was duly and immediately examined by
the government upon the fubjetl, with a vfew
to prosecute ihe person or persons who had
committed the offence, but that 110 dilcovery
could he made." Is it poflible that any man
Ihould be so ignorant of the chsrafln of the citi
