Nums. 48 of Vol. ll.] SATURDAY, April 13, 1793-
Additional Report of the Secretary of the
Trcajury, relative to the Loans negotia
ted under the Acts of the tfh and 12th of
August, 1790.
[Continued from our lafl, and concluded.]
tT may be objeÂ£led, that the rule laid
â¢* down has been on several occasions ex
ceeded. How this has happened at cer
tain periods has been explained. But there
is a view of the fubjefl which will throw
further light upon it.
The sums which appear on hand at the
end of any quarter are always larger on a
retrofpeHive than on a previous view. This
proceeds from the following cause.
The judgment to be formed beforehand
of the funis which will be within
any future period, mud of ne< e'iity be re
gulated by the returns in pofleflion of the
treasury, at the time the examination if
made. As these come forward with nio c
or less punctuality, that judgement will b?
more or less accurate ; !>w tlv- :;|>p .1'
ance on the returns \vill always be fliort o!
the faÂ£t ; because a certain number of re
turns, at any period of examination, will
neceflarily be deficient. What does not
appear must of course be eflentially ex
cluded from the calculation ot the receipt;
to be expefled within any near p.nod.
Because the extent of the funis which ma\
liave accrued, beyond those (hewn by the
returns in hand is unknown, and it is lliil
more uncertain in what months the pay
ments of them mayfallâand the combi
nations of the treasury, asto the means ol
fulfilling the demands upon it, ought to
proceed as little as poflible upon conjec
tures and uncertainties.
Monthly abdrafts of the bonds taken at
each port, are the documents which serve
to inform the treasury of the progress ol
the receipts upon the duties of imports.
From these a general abltraft is made up
once a inon 1 h at the treasury, for the in
formation of the head of the department,
(hewing the amount payable ui each month.
But very conliderable differences appear
from one month to another. The State
ment C, will serve as an illustration.
It contains a comparison of the funis
shewn by two successive abdraits, one ol
the 7th of November, the other of the 7tl;
of December lad, for .1 term of ten
months, distributed into monthly ftibdivi
fions. The aggregate difference upon the
whole term between the two abdratls is
495,308 dollars and 73 cents: upon twe
months, beginning with November ant
ending with December, it is 151,789 dol
lars and 40 cents ; upon a quarter begin
ning with January, and ending with March
it is 174,471 dollars and 66 cents; upon :
fubfeqnent quarter it is 81,055 dollars anc
81 cents ; upon a dill subsequent quartei
it is 87,991 dollars and 86 cents.
Hence it is evident, that an arrangement
founded upon the abstract of the o.
November, wouid fuppefe a receipt durinj
any part of the time embraced by it, eve*
the mill proximate, conliderably less thai
would appear by the abdratt only oik
month later : and it mud always happen
from thistircumftance, that the actual re l
ceipts, while ptintluality is preserved, wil
exceed the anticipations of them, and thai
greater balances will be found to cxift a
any piven period than could have been be
forehand fafely calculated or aaed upon.
This circumstance, duly confide red, wil
be a further and a powerful judication o]
the condnot pursued generally, in relatior
to the monies from time to time kept 01
hand, and particularly with regard u
the loans of the bank, low as the (late ol
the treasury appears to hpve been 011 a re
trofpe&ive view, when the monies upor
those loans were called for, the prolpect.
at each time, mud have prefeuted the ap
pearance of a less competent supply, ora
greater deficiency, than was afterward:
realized. .
I am not sure but that I owe an apology
to the House for taking up so much of its
time in obviating the imputation of paiti
ality or favoritifm, towards the banksâ
The afpeÂ£t under which I view it, admo
nishes me that I may have annexed to it
greater importance than was intended tc
be given to it by its authors.
That adifpofition friendly to the accom
modation of those institutions, as far a:
â¢ hey might be confident with official duty &
the public interest, has charafleriCed the
conduct ot the department, w ill not be de-
No man placed in the office of Secreta

doubts he may havebrought into it, would

those doubts to a full conviction, that banks
are efl'ential to the pecuniary ope rations oi
the government.
No man, having a practical knowledge
of the probable resources ot the country,
in the article of fpecic (which he would
with caution rate beyond the actual reve
nues of the government) would rely upon
the annual collection of four millions and
a half of dollars, without the instrumen
tality of institutions, that give a continual
impulse to circulation, and prevent the
llagnation, to be otherwise expected from
locking up from time to time large funis
(or periodical difburfemcnts ; to lay no
thing of the accommodations, which la
diitate to the merchant the payment of the
Loniiderable demands made upon him by
the treasury.
No man, practically arqua nted with the
pecuniary ability ot intlividuals, in thi
conntrv, would count upon finding th.
means of tbole anticipations of the cur
rent revenue for the current fiprvice, which
have been and will be necessary, from any
jther l'ource, than that ol the banks.
No prudent administrator of the finan
ces of the country, therefore, hut would
Yield to the difpofuion, which has been ac
knowledged, as alike eficiitial to the nuei -
ell of she government and to the <atiriac -
:ory discharge of his trust : a tlifpoiition
which would naturally lead to goodotf.ces,
within the proper and jultifiable bounds.
After the explanation which has been
offered, to manifelt the neceflity and pro
priety of the loans made of the bank, it

futation of theprocefs, by which it hat.
been endeavoured to eltablilh, that the
government pays seventeen per cent, upon
;hofe loansâThe Hate of the treasury ren
dered it expedient to borrow the fufljs
which were borrowed ; they Have been
inly received,,and the rate of intereii lii
aulated upon tliein is 5 per cent. T he gov
rrnment then pays upon them 5 P cr tcnt
md no more. _ _ '
The hillory which was given in my last
etter of the course and Situation of the
"oreign fund, proves that the supposition,
'rom which the inference, of paying fe
. enteen pcr cent, upon the domellic loan,
las been drawn, is erroneous.âThe ba
lances 011 hand at the refpeftive periods in
(tiellion, are the residues of the monies
which had been received from every
fource âincluding the loans foreign and
domcltic.
But if the supposition, which appears to
have been made, had been trueâit was
[till impolfible that seventeen per cent,
rould have been paid. By 110 construction
can the rate be extended beyond ten. â
The mean intereftof the money borrow
ed abroad including charges is j per cent.
âthe interest stipulated to be paid on the
loan from the bark is dfo fiveâthe Allll el
the two is ten. âIt is immaterial for what
purpose the foreign fund was obtained,
whether to pay to France or to purchase
the debtâthe worlt confequenee that can
rcfult is double not treble interest.âThe
interest payable to France is payable lor
monies borrowed and /pent during llie war.
It can never be truly laid that, that inter
est is now payable 011 any cxiltiug fund,
whether borrowed in Holland or borrow
ed in the United States, or borrow ed rlicre
ind re-borrowed hereâltcarinever fervc
:o make an addition to the enft or charges
L>f any fuchfund. '1 is payable upon out-,
long imce procured and hjed.
But it is not obvious how the suppositi
on came to be entertained, that all the mo
llies drawn here from theforeign fund'had
been borrowed forthepayment of the debt
to France.âThe prelumption would feeni
to have been more natural, that they hud
been principally, if not wholly introduc
ed with a view to purcliafes of the debt,
and consequently had a more special refei -
ence to the ast authorizing a loan lor that
purpose. And the fait is, that this \Va:
the deflination of far the greatest propor
tion of the funis drawn forâlt has been
Hated, that a part had an eye to the l'up
plies to St. Domingo, and that anothei
part was introduced with a view to the
payment of the foremen officers.
The additional observations to which 1
fnall requcft the attention of the HOIIO
will apply to the course aud state of the
linking fund, concerning which, I tranf
initted with my last communication, three
llatements numbered I, 11, and 111. t
To give a more colleftcd view of thi 1 .
part of thefubjeft, it may be of life to in

which have been itated in other places.

Out of the linking fund composed of the

for teafoirs which have been Cated, it
â vas finally deemed advifeable to piacc

Consequently there remained on the ill

The law d:reÂ£ts that this fund dial! be in
verted within 30 days after each quai ter.
This provision began to take effect 011 tht
lit of July lall.
But the ir.veftments were notmade With
in the refpeftive times prescribed. This
proceeded partly frouj) the state of the
market, and partly from the regulations
adopted by the fiommillioners, who were,
the Secretary of State, the Attorney Gen
eral, and the Secretary of the Treasury.
[Total No. 152.]
Their regulations applying to the two
firft quarters, limited the prices to certain
rates and prefcr.bed the mode of sealed
proposals. The Treasurer was appointed
agent for the commifliencrs.
The proposals, with rc-garcJ to the firft
quarter were receivable 'till the 28th of
July inchifivelyânone were offered, as the
i reafurtr reported td ine, and nothing was
done.
The experiment of sealed proposals vvai
again tried the second quarter, with fame
what more, though fliiluith but little
luccefc âT he relttittion to this mode of
proceeding was refunded, on the last day
of the thirty, allowed for purchafsig, and
fomr furtherpurchafes were made, but the
whole sum inverted was only 25,969 dol
lars and 56 cents.

The unapplied part of the fnrplus of
1790, having been expended in aid ol the

which accrue are immediately paid ;
whereas the cases of prompt payment are

particular articles imported in one veii'el,
by oneperfon or co-partner(hip, do not ex

credit not less than 4 months is allowed,
which carries the payment on the impor

If the whole amount of the duties,
which accrucd during the firft quarter ol
179 A in caih and bo ids, was no more than
307 r63 dollars and 84 cents, adding 1-7
for the additional duties, it ought bv ana

T he Secret 'ty is also accountable to the
public for a loss in thepayment ot interest o
so much of the debt to France ag is equal in
amount to the aforefaid several films drawn
over to this country during the fame period
of time, (ince it is now well understood and
admitted, that the diversion cl the money
here produced a defalcation ;n the pay-
ments to France in equal ratio. 1..
computed at 5 p:r cc.it. is equal to 6:9
lolljrs, and added to the aforefaid si.li) of
6-354 dollars makes tile total loss w hie ji
he public fultaine'd upon the money drawn
>vcr in ihe year 1791, one hundred and
hijrty-nins thcufand, nine hundred and
â ighty-three dollars.
The lof> upon the monies drawn over in

jrinciples; the amount drawn for being
ibont r,200,000 dollars, but the Secreta
ry's reports refpefling it have been so dark
u d ambiguou no dale or amount being

urope Or this country, that no precipe
fateinent of it can yet be made. It is,
lowever. leaving-littie to conje&ure, if thi:
ols be eflimatect as at ieaft equal to 50,00 c

)Ã¼blic upon the whole of what has beer

lien.bfned, too, that during the year 1-92,
Hid W'hilft the bank w as poilefled of a mucl

Ã¼bjefted the public to a further loss ot ;

No exception will, it is prefnmef!,be ta

1. equal to eleven percent, altho'the Se
retary in his report of the 19th of Febru
ry last, page 11, fee:ns tp infer that th<
01? could not be extended beyond ten pei
'ent. His words are. "If tlie fuppolitior
a hicli appears to have bet n made, had bee

:ould have been paid. By no conjlruciiot
an the rate Le extended Oeyond ten." Fo.
lie Secretary a| pears to have forgottci
hit whilfl we were paying j percent, to Hoi
a: d for the money borrowed and draw i
>vei- here, and another 5 per cent, on tht
lebt due to France, one of which was;
.'ear loss to the United States, there wh
noreover an actual loft of fix per cent, in
urrcd at home by the non-inveifiture o
he money in flock, his own ffatement
;xhibiting tnat,until Augull 1 791, the mar
'.et prhe oi' lix per cents had not reachei
SOS. in the pound, and that purchases in th<

nuch greater profit to the public.
Haviag thus exhibited the aggregate a
nount of Icfsfuiiaincd by the people ot tin
Jnited States, in the misapplication of thi
public monies, it occurs to ihew.
Secondly, The aiiual gain to the bank
jy an illegal u 'e O the public m<*iier.
Upon this pniilt, after the acknowledp;
lient made by the secretary, to wit, Tha
m the ill of January 'aft,' there waj 01
land a greater amount in cafii of the pub
ie money than the whqlefmp 0f2.304.-Y-K
loilars originally drawn over iron) Hoi
a id, it would be fuperilnous to exami.ii
mnutely \\ hen the monies so drawn ove
ivere palled into the treasury, or receive*
it bank, since it mull be admitted as untie
liably jnff, that if the secretary and tin
)anks can charge the public with the/?/
irumentatity ot that money for public pur
jofes, when it is acknowledged never t*
lave been expended, the public have a tw<
old claim to ch rge the secretary and the
- inks, in whose hands the money aftualb
vas, with the inftrnmentality of the fa mi
noney for bank purpofes.up'to the said fii I
lay of January lad. In this view, thegai,
o :Ue banks is clearjaid obvious. ByÂ°thi
barter and conflitution of the refpectiva
xmks, they are ed to discount at ;
ate not exceeding fix per centum per an
"ins, upon twice the amount of the monie:
hey may at any time have in deposit; am
r is a well known principle of banking thai
lepolits of money do not lay unemployed
Hence, elfimating at the fix per cent, rate
ifintereft, the loss to the public upon the
monies drawn over in 1-91, at 76.354 dol
lars, and upon the monies drawn over ii
1792, at 50,000 dollars, making togethe:
1 -26,354 dollars, it results that the ac.ua
lain 10 tiie banks may be computed ai
dollars.
It now remains to Ihew, Thirdly, Th.
joffibie and probable gain to the favourite;
at the bank by the injhumentality of d f
counts on the illegal depofitsof the public
monies.
The report of the Secretary lart referred
:o. page 14, throws some light 011 this point.
Hellas there given a certificate ligned bv
Vlatthew M Connell, one of the broker.-
at Philadelphia, Hating " the marketpri;e
ifpublic flocks, taken from actual purchase
and sales during the years 1791 and 1792.''
From this certificate it will appear to the
(lighted observer, that the brckeraec rntt
if interest tor money during those periods,
and which it is well known was never lef
upon the average than two per cent, pei
month, did not reach or exceed the atlual
prefit 1 o the buyers and fellers of flock,
uhich its fluctuations of price yield; d
Hence, those favourites o tl c bank, win.
ilelired to profit by the' Huftnarions in th,
pijcei of stock, and were always at bane
toÂ» receive its discounts, could place the
money thus obtained to a dear profit ol
1? per centum per annum, that bring the
difference between he before mentiont c'
brokerage rateo!' interest, or monthly pro
fit of money during the periods I have re
termed to, and the lix per centum p;r a.i
uuiii, paid to th." ba. i; for its diUouiits.
If tlien, as linsbeen fhcwn, rhe bank at it
legal rate of" iix per ceit. interelt.mighr
E ;< ' e . *5-i.708 dollars, it follows that The
profit to its favourites, eftimatid upon the?
foregoing principle at 18 per ccnt. would
be equal to ihe sum of 758,124 dollars, be
ing thrice the amount of the legal pro.lt to
chÂ» !> ink. But could there exist ~'d lu i>t as to
thepirffible 1 ain here dated to the favourites
"1 the bank, it would be removed by cal
ling to mind the progress of tilings dtirint
t!ie period of the Scrip-mania,which com
menced 011 the 4th of July i 7yi , when the
inscription to the bank of the United
S tales took efiect, and continued until some
Lime iij Maccli 1792, w hen the bubble burlt
by the failure and imprisonment of its prime
mover William Duer, late afirtant to the
Secretary ol the Treasury. How many
favourites made their fortunes within that
period, or how many, for lack of prudence,
I ailed to dofo, it may not be materia! r.o-jj
to panic ul.rize. It will be fufficient to
glance at a few of the co,liberations which
lU.tiiy the probability that the pojfible gain
Oi 753,124 dollars before stated has been
realized to the favourites of the bank.

IN a republican government it is a duty
incumbent on every citizen to a Sard his
afsfiance, either by taking a pari in its ini'-
mediate adminirtration, or by his advice,
and watchfulnefa, that its principles may
remain uncorrupt ; for the spirit ot" liber
ty, like every virtue of the mind, is to be
kept alive only by conftam aftionâlt un
fortunately happens that objects of gene
ral concern seldom meet with the indivi
dual attention which they merit, and that
individual exertion seldom produces a ge
neral effect; it is therefore of eflential mo
ment.' that political societies fa >uld be
cltablithed ill a free government, that a
joint operation may be produced, which
lhail give that attention and exertion so
necelfary to the preservation of civil liber
ty âThe importance and truth of these re
flections have operated upon a number ol
Germans in this city, they have therefore
thought fit to ali'ociate themselves in a so
ciety under the name of the German re
publican society of Philadelphia. The
..German character has hitherto languiihed
in America, owing to the inattention ot
the Germans to objeÂ£h Â»f governme it
and education ; it is high time they Ihould
step forward, declare themselves indepen
dent of other influence, and think for
themfelvesâlgnorance not only excludes
us from many enjoyments in life, bnt
renders us liable toimpofition, and to judge
of an evil, and its extent we Ihould have
a mUdcultivated by education, added to
our own, or the experience of others ;
hence the neceflity of inltruction and in
formation in a government where every
citizen ihould be capable of judging of the
conduct of rulers, and the tendency of
lawsâThe society withes to impress the
importance and the advantages ot educati
on upon the minds of their brethren
throughout the stateâTo be reflected,
men should be virtuous, but to be capable
of fulfilling a republican duty and ot ser
ving our country, we should connect wis
dom with virtueâThere is adifpolition in
the human mind to tyrannize when cloath
ed with power, men therefore who are en
trusted with it, should be watched with
the eye of an eagle to prevent those abuses
which never fail to arise from a want of
vigilanceâJealousy is a security, nay it is
a virtue in a republic, for it begets
watchfulnefs ; it is a necefiary attendant
upon a warm attachment to our country.
Tne society wifli to call the attention of
their countrymen to affairs of (tare ; they
wilh to inspire them with jealousy to guard
them against every encroachment on the
equality of freemen ; As the faithful ad
mi iiltratioii of government depends great
ly upon a judicious delegation made to of
flees dependant upon the people, it is a
common duty to give this every attention ;
we (halt, therefore, comprehend this in
our plan, and we will take the liberty,
uccalionally, to offer ouropinions, and (hall
t!:ke a peculiar pleasure in receiving a
free communication of fentimerlt from
you on this subjectâWe think proper to
n lign reasons why we have aif iciated our
feilves in a German society, and why we
hive chosen the German language, to con
<lud and communicate our tranfaftions ;
A large portion of the citizens of this Itate
are German, and many of them are whol
ly ignorant of the Englilh language, and
therefore ignorant of the most essential
transactions of our government ; it is but
jult, therefore, that information should be
given them in a language which they un
delftand, on those subjects which involve
this d'-areft interests âBeing, in rommon
wilh our brethren of other nations, but
ole people, we will not to m ike national

require ; a kindred in language w ill ne
cefi'arily draw men together, for we are as
naturally inclined to those with whom we
can hold communion in our own, as we
are distant from others, who are incapa
ble of social intercourse with us from an
ignjiranc'e of their languageâThis will be
get dHHnifion, but as it is more the diftinc
tioit of language than of nation, it will
only remain until the-~finglHh language
(hall become the mother tongue of every

THE tumult which the late election
X for a delegate lor ,this diflrict has
produced, and the report of my having
taken ail aÂ£tive part therein, has rendered
it necefl'ary that I make the following re
marks.
I luppofe that the strictures on the pro
ceedings of Cosigrefs which have appear
ed in yours and other papers, tinder my
lignature, are still remembered, which a
mong other confederations proceeded from
the opinion that the Secretary of the Trea
fury, had either ex officio, or by ufurpati
-011, acquired an influence aid power over
the wealth and councils of America which
are incompatible with the principles ui
that conltitution under which he holds hi
appointmentâThus thiiiking. I rejoiced
at the prospect of that .pu'ilic inquiry,
which the refolutioni of Mr. Giles con
tempiated ; to obtain certain aid earl\
information on thisfubjeit, I wasextreme
ly inquisitive, and was advised before the
resolutions were acted upon, that a majo
rity oi Congress were determined, either
to perplex them with difficuliies, or de-'l)
their propriety ; it remained then only to
inquire who 01 the delegates from this
itate ihould give aid to tlie forejudging
majority.
i he yeas and nays as publilhed in the
Nation il Gazette, which wasthetirt cer
tain inform ition I obtained, dated tliat
Mr. Gritii i voted with the majority, anil
in opposition to the general voice oi his
colleaguesâbeing of opinion that they
were merely queitions of fait, that there
was a predetermined majority, and thai
the members who were of the minority
had in every initaiice shewn themselves to
be firm patriots, 1 declared that Mr. Grif
lin ihould not have my vote, which decla
ration being made, it became necefl'ary
then to give my reafous. The day after
[ uas informed bv a member of Oongrefs
ihat the communications from the treafu
ry department came so la.e into the lioufc
that it was impoflible for members uhoh, d
not been eng iged 111 the detail, so to invefti
jate the fubjett, as to give a condemnato
ry vote. I alio heart! that Mr. Giles was
lot permitted to withdraw the aforefaid
resolutions.
Under these imprefllons, I had some con
serfation with Col. Goodall of Hanover,
nul retai led the fame sentiments, until l it
ivas communicated to me by Mr. Giles,
hat Mr. Griflin, did not even in his view ,
lefei ve censure, that he had Voted for one
>f the rofolutions, and that he could not
noflibly have had time to invest"gate them
ill minutely, as to the particularsof which,
I refer to your last paper ; in confequenct
jf this information I thought it my duty
:o undeceive those who might have rectiv
;d a prejudite from my declarationsâl
lot only did so, but gave Mr. Grilfin my
foteâand ,hould have informed Col
joodill thereof, if I had not heard that he
Hid not intend to go to the election, and
:hat Mr. Giles had freely made the fam<
ommunicatimi! to many of Mr. Griffin's
riends, both of this place and Hanover.
With respect to the gentlemen Ulit)
were candidates, I never was the partizan
>feitherâmy intention was to vote for
lie man who I thought would render the
110 ft service to his condiments, and al
though I voted 011 Monday with cheer
"ulnefs for Mr. Griflin, on Saturday I
hould have aÂ£ted very differently âBy
his Ido not mean tojnftify Mr. Griffin's
/ote, though I am fatisfied that his motive
ivas strictly proper.
And now, Mr. Printer, I fliall take my
eave, with the observations, that although
he resolutions may never be revivedâal
hough Mr. Hamilton may be continued
iurjng life as the legiQative diitator of the
mionâalthough a fiction may fiipprcfs
jr negative all future enquiry, I never
si-ill believe, that our countrymen, Madi
-011, Page, Giles, Parker, Moore, and Mer
;er,would act and vote as they have done,
.vithout a juftification beyond the reach of
-eproof or criticism. And it is a mat
er of contemptuous indignation with me,
:o hear contumelious insinuations from
lien who, a little time ago, considered one
if thein as the pivot on which the conlli
ution relted ; âbut then there was no ex
rifeâllo tax 011 newfpapersânoconfolida
:ion of revenueâllo national bankâno
iflumptionâno factionâno jesuitical dlf
;inctiÂ«n of orders and balancesâno fell
.reated, upltart aristocracyâno con
:lavesâno leveesâno di&atorial execu
:ive officerâllo crusadings again(t Indians
âno credit in Europeâin fine, no meta
physeal essays to prove, that 'tis light for
:he adminiflrator of the revenue, to keep
ip 500,000 dollars of the public money
.inder the designation of initrlimentality.
svhen the whole continent was in tumult
:o obtain a finaller sum, by the means ot
an excise, so odious and difgiilling, that
even the great and virtuous W; fliington,
was obliged to ifliie an official proclamati
on.âOh AmericansâAmericans 1 how
are you debafedandinfulted, by those who
fay that (three or four excepted) there
are none anion" you qualified to discharge
the higher offices of government ! The
question presents a melancholy and awful
profpeft, the evils of whicl) it behoves

the former account may be conlidered a:
fully contradicted.
Letters from Sweden intimate, that a
ferment prevails thro' all the provinces ol

British habits, British affeSions, ideas, at
tachments, prejudices, and even resent

try since the late war. No better evidence
of this truth is wanting than the torrent ol

American presses by the vile tools of Bri

From a London paper.~\
JN the name of the holy trinity, the
father, the son, and the holy ghod.
this day the 21ft of December, 1792,1
Louis the XVI, of the name, king of
France, having been for more than four
months imprisoned with my family in the
tower of the temple at Paris, by those
who were my fubjefls, and deprived of all
communication whatloever, ever since the
I ith instant, with my own family; more
over, being implicated in a trial of which
it is impossible to forefee the ifTue, 011 ac
count of the paflions of men, and for
which no pretext or means can be found
in any txiding law ; having only God
for the witnefa of my thoughts, and to
whom J can address myfelf, I here declaie,
in his presence, my last will and senti
ments : â¢
" I leave my f6ul to God, my creator,
I pray him to receive it in mercy, and not
tojudge it according to its deserts, but
according to those of our Lord Jelus
Chriit, who offered himfelf a facrifice to
Cod his Father, for us men, however un
worthy, and for me the mod unworthy.
I die in the union of our mother the Ca
tholic, Apollolic, and Roman church,
who holds her powers by an uninterrupt
ed fucccffion from St. Peter, to whom Je
fuÂ» Chrid entruded them I firmly be
lieve and acknowledge every thing con
tained in the commandments of God and
the church, the lacraments and myderies,
such as the church teaches, and hath al
ways taught them ; I have never preten
ded to make myfelf a judge of the differ
ent modes of explaining the dogmas which
divide the church of Jesus Chrid, but I
have conformed, and will always conform,
if God grants me life, to the decisions
which the highed Ecclesiastics of the
holy Catholic church give, and (hall give,
conformably to the discipline of the
church followed since Jesus Chrid. Ila
ment with my hear-, our brethren who
may be in error ; but I pretend not to
judge them, and I love them no less in Je
sus Chrid, according to what Christian
charity teac'ies US. I pray God to par
don all my fins ; I have endeavoured to
know them scrupulously, to deted them,
and to humble myfelf in his prcfe ce.â
Not being able to avail myfelf if the mi
nidry of a Catholic pried, I pray God to
receive the confeffton which I have-made,
and above all my profound repentance for
having put my name, (though it was a
gainll my will) to afls which may be
contrary to the dif ipline and belief of
the Catholic church, to which I have al
ways remained f.ncer.ly united in heart ;
I pray God to accpt of my firm refoluti
on, if he grant me life, to make use as
soon as I can of the minidrv of a Catho
lic plied, to confefs myfelf of all my fins,
and .0 receive the sacrament of repentance;
I request all th fe whom I have offended
thro' inadvertence, for I do not recollect
having knowingly offended any one, or
those to whom I may have given bad
example orfandal, to forgive me the evil
which they think I have done them.
" I intrrat all charitable persons to join
their prayers with mine, to obtain of God
the pardon of my fins.
" I forgive, wiih all my heart, those
who have tnade theinfelves my enemies
without my having given them any cause ;
and I pray God to forgive them, as well
as those who, through a falfe or mistaken
zeal, have done me much evil.
" 1 recommend to God, my wife, my
children, my fider, my aunts, my brothers,
and all those who are attached to me by
the ties of blood, or in any other manner
whatsoever. I pray God particularly to
look with the eyes 0/ mercy on my wife,
my children, and my filler, who have
long been the partners of my fufferings ;
to fudain them by his grace, if they (hould
lose me ; and as long as they remain in
this perilhable world. I recommend to
her, above all, to make them good cliridi
ans, and honed members of society ; to
mak them conlider the grandeurs of this
world, if they are condemned to prove
them, but, as things dangerous and pelifh
able, and to turn their views towards the
only and solid glory of eternity. I re
qiicd my lifter to continue her teSdernefs
to my children, and to be a mother to

tlicm, if they fl.onld have the misfortune
to lose their own.
" I entreat rny wife to forgive me all
the evils which (lie iuffers on my account,
and the untafinefs which I may have cau
sed her in the course of our union ; as (he
may be allured, that I remember nothing
againll her, if (he thinks Die lia's any thing
to reproach herfclf with.
" I earnedly recommend to my chil
dren, next to their duty to God, which
thev ought to prefer to every tiling, to
maintain mutual union, fubmifiion and
obedience to their mother, and gratitude
for all the cares which file incurs for them,
and in memory of me.
" I entreat them to conCder my filler
as a second mother. I recommend to my
son, if he fhonld have the misfortune to
become king, to tliink that he owes him
felf entirely to the good of his fellow-citi
zens ; that he ought to forget all hatred
and all resentment, and especially whatever
relates to the misfortun s and uneafincfs
which I experience; that he cannot pro
mote the good of the public but by reign
ing according to the laws; but, at the
fame time, that a king cannot make the
laws rf fpefted, and do the good he wishes,
but in proportion as he has the necessary
authority ; and that, without this, being
fettered 111 his operations, and ir.lpiring 110
refpett, lie is more injurious than ufeful.
I recommend to my son to take care of all
the perf-ns who were attached to me, as
far as his circumdances (hall give him the
means ; to th ink that this is a sacred debt
which I have contra&ed to the children or
relations of those who have died for me,
and next, to those who arc unfortunate 011
my account. 1 know that there are many
persons of those who were attached to me,
who have not conduced thtmfelves to
wards me as they ought, and who have
even shewn me ingratitude ; but I forgive
them (often, in the moments of trouble
and effervefcence, a man is not master of
himfelf;) and I entreat my son, ifhe thould
have the opportunity, to remember only
their misfortunes. I could wish to be able
to tedify my gratitude to those who have
dilplayed a true and diflnterefted attach
meiit to me. On the one hand, if I was
fcnfibly ast eft ed by the ingratitude and dis
loyal y of persons to whom I had never
(hewn any thing but favour to them, their
relations, or friends ; on the other, I have
had the consolation of feeing the volun
tary attachment and interest which many
persons have shewn to me. I entreat
them to accept of my thanks ; in the sitU
ation in which things still are, I (hould be
afraid of bringing them into danger, if ]
were to speak more explicitly ; but 1 re
commend particularly to my son to seek
all occasions of discovering them.
" I should nevertheless, think that I
calumniated the sentiments of the nation
did I not openly recommend to my son
M V. de Chamilly and Hu, whose true
attachment to me induced them to (hut
themselves up with me in thu mournful
residence, and who were near being the
unhappy vi&ims of what they did. I alio
recommend to him Cleri, with whose at
tention I have had every reason to be fatis
lied since he has been with me. As it is
he who has remained with me to the lad,
I requell M. M. of the Commune, to de
liver to him my clothes, my books, my
watch, my purse, and the other little ef
fects which have been deposited at the
Council of the Commons.
" I also mod willingly forgive those who
guarded me, the ill treatment and severity
which they thought it their duty to make
me fuffer. I have found some feeling and t
companionate fouls ; may they enjoy the
tranquility of heart, which ought to spring
from their manner of thinking.
" I entreat M M. de Malelherbes,
Tronchet, and Defeze, to receive here my
thanks, and the expression of my sensibili
ty, for all the care and all the pain which
they took for me.
" I conclude by declaring, before God,
and as I am ready to appear before him,
that I reproach myfelf with none of the
crimes which are alledged to me,

AFRICAN CHURCH.
On Tuesday the ?d indant, the Cor
ner Stone of the AFRICAN CHURCH
was laid in Fifth Stieet, between Walnut
and i>piuce Streets, by four of the mem
bers of the church.â One of them after
wards kneeled down upon the stone and
prayed in a fervent manner for the success
and ufefulnefs of the undertaking.
This church will be forty-fix feet in
front, and sixty in depth. It has been be
gun by private subscriptions from a num
ber, and by a loan from one of the citi
zens of Philadelphia.
Should these resources prove infafficient
to complete the building, it is to be hoped,
further contributions will not be withheld
by a people who have been celebrated in
dillant countries.for originating plans, not
only for emancipating, but for improving
the condition of the opprcfled bhcks.
There are at present, nearly 5000 Af
ricans and descendants of Africans in this
city.âFrom the natural attraction which
persons related to each other by sameness
of color, country, and above all, misfor
tune, have for each other, there can be no
doubt but these people will be belter ta
ken care of in religious inttitutiotss, con
ducted by themselves, than by persons
who are not related to them by the fame
peculiar and forcible obligations.
