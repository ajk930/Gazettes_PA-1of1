Vol. I.
Exposition of t!it motives ou which the
Fretfch National Aflembly have pro*
claimed the Convocation of a.National
Convention, and pronounced the fuf
pension of the executive power in the
hands of the king.
THE National Aflemblv owe to the
nation, to Europe, and to posteri
ty, a rigorous account of the motives
which have determined their late resolu
tions.
Placss between the duty of remaining
faithful to their oaths, and that of saving
their couatry> they wiÂ£hed to fulfil both
at the fame time, and to do all that the
public fafety required, without usurping
the power* with which the people had not
eotrufted them.
At the opening of their fefSon, an as
femblage of emigrants, forme.! on the
frontiers, kept up a correspondence with
all the enemies of liberty that were it ill to
be fund io the departments, or among
the troops of the line; and fanatical pi ielts,
infufing trouble into fuperllitious minds,
fought to persuade those deluded citizens
that the conilitulion wounded the rights
of conscience, and that the law had con
fided the functions of religion to fchifmati
cal and facrilegioiw persons.
Finally, a league formed among power
fill kings, menaced the liberty of France ;
they fancied they had a right to fix to
what degree the interest of th. ir despotism
permitted us to bÂ« fr- e, and flattered
themselves that they ihouid lee the sove
reignty of the people, and the indepen
dence pf.the French empire, fall down be
fore thf atmis of ther llaveg.
Thus everything announced a civil and
religious wot, of which a foreign war would
soon increase the danger.
The National .A (Tembly thought it thrir
dsty to repr;ls the emigrants, and to re
fttayi the fadii/U.) pricllg by fcvere decrees j
and th<J king employed againit these de
erets the suspensive refufal of fan ion
which the eonttitetion granted him. In th;
mean time, those emigrants and those
prleits were busily acting n the name of
the king j it yas to him in
what they cal'<d his luwfuj authority, that
the former had taken lip arms, and the
latter were preaching affaffi nation and tvea
son. These emigrants were the brothers
of the king, his relations, his former body
guards. And while the coirefpondence
of these fa&s with the conduit of the king
authorized, nay, enjo'ned dill;ult , this re
fufal o-f the fanfiion applied to decrees that
could not be fulpeuded without being an
nihilated, fhcw.ed clearly how the veto,
suspensive according to the law rendered
definitive by the manner of employing it
gave to the king the unlimited and arbi
trary power of rendering null all the mea
sures which the legislative h>dy might
think necefiary for maintaining liberty.
Fiom that moment, from one end of the
kingdom to the other, the people (hewed
thole gloomy difcontei'ts that announced
storms, and the suspicions which accu'ed
the executive powers, displayed themselves
with energy.
The National Assembly were not dif
icouraged. Princes who pro felled them
selves the allies of France, had givefi to
the emigrants, not an asylum, but the li
feerty of arming, of forming themselves in
to military bodies, of ievymg soldiers, of
providing military (lores; and the king
was invited, by a falann melfage, to
break, on this violation of the rights of
nations, a silence that had bten kept but
.too long. He seemed to yield to the na
tional wish; preparations for war weie
ordered ; but it was soon perceived, tl at
the ncgociations conducted by a minifby
weak or treacherous, were confined to ob
taining vain promiles, which remained un
executed, could not be regarded but as a
ihare or an insult. The league of kings

The National A {Terribly thmtrrht that it
was necessary for the fafety of France* tc
oblige the emperor to declare wheihcr he
would be her ally, or her enemy, and to
pronounce between two contradictory trea
ties, of which the one bound him to give
succours to and the other engaged
hinl to attack her, treaties Which he could
not reconcile, without avowing the intenti
on of separating the king from the nation,
and of reprefentiog a war against the
French people, as succours granted to his
ally. The emperor's arifwer augmented
the djftruft which this combination erf cir
cumstances rendered so natural. In it he
repeated the absurd charges against the
AfTembly of the reprcfentatives of the [
French people, againfl the popular focie !
t es established in our cities, with which
the partizan3 of the French minrftry had
long wearied the counter revolution pres
ses. He made protellations ofhisdefire'
to continye the ally of the 'King, and he
hadjuft Cgntda new league ajjainll France, :
in favor of the authority of the king of the
French.
TheÂ£e leagues, these treaties, the in
trigues of the emigrant# , who had fplicit
ed them in the name of the king, had been
concealed by the wiaiftees from the repre
f ntatives of the people. No public diÂ£*
vowal of these intrigues, no effort to pre
vent or dilfulve this conspiracy of mo
narchy, had (hewn either to the citizens of
Fiance, or the of Furope, that the
king had iincerely united his ovrn cause to'
that of the nation.
This apparent connivance between the
cabinet of the Thuillerie.s .arid that of Vi
enna, (truck every miud ; the National
Affembiy thought it their duty to examine
with vigor the conduct of the minitler for
foreign avail's ; and a decree of accusation
was the refnlt of this examination. His
colleagues disappeared with him, and the
King's council was formed of patriot mi.
nillerfl.
The fticceffor of followed the
course of his father. He thought proper
to require for the princes, formerly pof
fefling Feifa in Alsace, indemnificatt
ons incompatible with the French con
dilution, and derogatory to the indepen
dence ot the nation. He wanted France
to betray the confidence and violate the
rights of the people of Avignon. At
length he announced other eairfes of com
plaint, which could not, he said, be dis
cussed before having tried the force gf
arms.
The king seemed to feel that thispro
vjcati >ri to war could not be borne pati
ently without betraying a fp.ameful weak
ness ; he seemed to feel how perfidious was
t his language of an enemy who pretended
to take an interest in his fate, and to dtfire
h:s alliance, for no purpose hut to.sow feeds
of discord between him and his people, cal
culated to etienvate our forces, and to flop
or disconcert their motions ; be proposed
wa' by the unanimous voice of his council,
and war wai decreed.
â By protefling the afiemblages of the
emigrants, by permitting them ;o menace
our frontiers, Jby (hewing troops in readi
ness to second them on the firft success, by
preparing a retreat for them, by perilling
in a threatning league, the k;ng of Hun
gary obliged France to make preparations
of defence ruinous in their expence, tx
haufted her finances, encouraged the au
dacity of the conspirators dispersed thro'
the departments, excited ttnealinefs among
the citizens, and thus fomented in them
and perpetuated trouble. Never did hosti
lities more really juftify war, and to de
clare was only to repel it.
The national gfeinbly were then able

i he formation of a camp between Paris
and the frontiers, was a dilpofuion happi

the fame time it served to give -security to
tlie internal departments, and to pre
vent the troubles which their disquiets.
might have produced ; the formation of
such a camp wjs ordered ; but these two
decrees wererejeÂ£hd by the king, and the
patriotic mini(tert) were uifipiffed.
The constitution had granted to the
Icing a guard of ISO men, and this guard
audaciouliy manifefted a contempt of civic
uties, which inspired the citizens with
indignation, or with terror ; hatred of the
constitution, and above all, ot liberty and
equality, were the beil titles for being
admitted into it.
The afTembly \v.93 forced to diflFolve this
g*iard, to prevent both the troubles which
it could not fail soon to occasion, and the
plots of counter revolution, of which but
too many indications were already uiani
fe!L The decree ww fan&ioned ; but a
proclamation by the bellowed praises
on those very men, whose difmiflion from
hisfervice he hadjuft pronounced, on those
whom he had admitted to be men justly
accused of being the enemies of liberty.
The new minilters ejeited veil founded
diltruft, and as tlvfl distrust could not flop
at them, it fell on the king himfelf.
The application of the refufa! of sanc
tion to decrees iqudered neceffafy by cir
cumstances, of which the execution ought
to have been prompt, and, mult (top with
â the decrees, was regarded in the general
opinion, 33 an interpretation of the con
(litptional adt, contrary to liberty, and
even to the spirit of the constitution.â
The agitation of the people of Paris be
came extreme ; an immense crowd of
citizens joined to form a petition in it;
they fo'icitgd the recal of the patriotic
mmitlers, and the retraction of the refufal
to fanft:on the decrees in favour of which
-the public opinion had been loudly de
clared. Tiiey d: fired leave so paf6 in arms
before the national affemb'y, after their
deputies had read their petition. This
leave, which other armed bodies had before
obtained, was granted them. They de*
tired to preffnt the fame petition to the
king, and to present it under the form*,
eltablifh.ed by law ; but at the moment
when municipal officers were coming to
ir.foAn them, that their deputies, who had
been refufed at firil, were going to be
i admitted, the gate was opened, and the
crowd rushed into the palace. The zeal

those of the departments, between the
people and the army, between the several
portions of the national guard, between the
citizens who remained 3t thsir homes and
those who were flying to the defence of
the state. The very next day the king
changed his language, a pioclamation,
full of calumny, was profufely dillributed

manded, to demand vengeance, and to

and every thing announced a plan dextat
roufly concerted for finding in the judicial
order, the means of giving an arbitrary
e* ten (ion to the royal authority. Letters
were found from the miniltef for the

against the federates, who might with to
take at Paiis the oath to fight Yor liberty,
and it required all the aÂ£i*ity of the nati

to prevent the fatal effete of this plan of
diforgamzation, which might have lighted
up the fl-mes of civil war. An emotion
of patriotism had extinguished in fraternal
union, the divisions that had appeared hut
too often in the national assembly, and
from this also the means of fjrfety might
have sprung. Ihe profceutionocommenc

been reinllated by the kin;? j and it was
possible, that this long series of faults and
treasons, might have fallen again entirely
upon those perfidious councilors,to whom
a confiding people had the long habit of
attributing all the crimes of our kings.

To the Editor of ihe National Gatette'.
S I R,
TN your paper of Wednesday la(l, I ob-
J_ served a piece signed Medicus, which
I have read with attention, but I nvnft
confefs not without pain ; inasmuch as it
is an illiberal and highly ungenerous
attack upon the talents and the cha
racter of a young man with whom I have
p'.ffed some of the happiest hours of the
three lad years of my life; a young man
â¢from whom I am daily reaping instruc
tion, and who, hi my opinion, is an craa
ruent to his csur.try.
Do not imagine, Mr. Freneau, that I
mean to enter into the Merits of the con
troveify about ledtures ; neither shall 1
pretend to to decide upon the-comprrative
merits of the ProfefTor of Materia Medica
and the Prafefforof Natural Hi;tory and
Botany in the nniverfity A3 far as my
acquaintance with Dr. Griffiths extends, I
think favourably of him ; so favourably
that 1 am persuaded he never wrote the
paper signed Medicus, since it is asserted
that the Dodter received a note from Dr.
Barton, in which the latter declared that
he had nothing to do with the " extradl"
originally publ'ifhtd in New-York, ana
since republifhed in your gazette, which
has given rife to the indecent language of
I edit us. My sole objedi, on this occ-lion,
is to render juilice to Dr. Barton, in the
view jjf a generous public.
Although Mcdicu: affe&a that the objett
of his paper is to icrve injured and m
iulted met it," yet, I think, a man mnil
he very blind, indeed, who does not dis
cover that his principal object is to injure
merit, which 1 have no hesitation in affert
siifj is of the molt superior kind.
In order to accomplifn the end, Med'icus
purfoes two ways : he endeavors to expose
to ridicule that science in the knowledge
of which Dr. Barton is coufctTcdty 'unri
valled in this country ; and he then at
tempts to rob rhe Dr. of the honour of
being acquainted with the science.
As to tha tirft objefit, Medirus might
have saved himfelf the trouble he has taken;
For the feience of Natural Hiitorv had been
exposed, as they imagined, to ridicule, by
the ignorant and the envious, long before
the birth of Medicvs. Sorry should Ibe
:o think that the candid and enlightened
;>hy!icians of Philadelphia wee of th;s
Ventleman's way of thinking. They need
iot be informed that in every polished
:ountry, both in ancient and in modern
:imes, Natural Hillory has been cultivated
as a branch of science at once beautiful
md important. They need not be told
that it has lent its aid to many of the arts
andfcienceswhichdignify and meliorate hu
man life; that it has even given new charms
to poetry, and that so nearly has it been
thought connected with medicine, that in
eveiy country the fathers ot this science
liave devoted a share of their attention to
it, and have generally been its greatelt or
naments. 1 aÂ»i not a phyfictan, but llill I
know the names of Caefulpiaus, Boerhaave,
Holler, Sauvages, Linne, Cuilen, Knhn,
and many otitis, than whom medicine
knows no higher names.
With regard to his second objedt, I a n
confident that I do not err in affecting that
Mtditut is ft'll more unfortunate. He
-alls into question the science of Dr. Bar
ion ; but his assertions are certainly lome
thing very different from convidtion, and
'rom truth. As I have the happinef. of
being intimately acquainted with this gen
tie man, I can speak to his talents and his
worth. In the circle of a very extensive
acquaintance, I do not know one man o.
the age of t*zueniy-nme, wnofe icienc is
more general, and at the fame time so tru
ly correct and profound, To a memory
as vast as that of a Crichton or a 3 rvin,
lie a<jds a gmrus florid and acute, and a
judgment accurate and ilrong. Even his
taite for the fine arts and his acquaintance
with literature, upon which hÂ» prides him
felf not, would give refpedtahihty to the
name of a much older man. Lot me add,
that to all these b'etT. gs and endowments
he joins an aftonilliing peifeverance in liu
dy, and an almost unlimited _ enthuiiafm
(or science, which will not fail to condu&
him to consequence in life.
It is not merely the names of plants and
animals, or the places which they occupy
in the system of this or that pihilofopher,
with which Dr Barton is acquainted.
With the philosophy and properties of
plants ; with the tlrudture, the functions,
and ceconomy of animals, he is, if polTible,
Hill more intimately conversant, In the
walk of his profeffion, he received very
early and diftingnifl ed honours, and in the
com'.ildl of its pradtice, I know him to be
not lels tender and affedtionate than he is
indefatigable in its itudy, and ambitious
to advance its limits
Tt is a melancholy circumstance to fee
superior merit neglected ! It enraptures
the foul of a good man to behold the in
gtnious, the learned, and the virtuous
bursting through the numerous difficulties
of early life. Dr. Barton is not neglected.
His friends learn with pleasure, and his
enemies with pain, that in proteffional
and in fcientifia reputation, none of his
countrymen are likely to Hand higher.
I have the honor of corresponding with
feme of the Dolor's foreign friends.
Their letters, which, if it were necessary,
I could produce, are the molt unequivo
cal and ;':v>p(e t-'ftimonials of his merits in
neural Inilory. I (hall take the liberty
of subjoining part of a letter which 1 late
ly received from a foreign Jjrofelfot- oi
jrreat learning. I have tranllated it at
literally as 1 am able from the orig rial
Latin in which it was written. " I re

Ihall not fail to find for if place in the

refpeitable rank among botanical philoso

letters. In my opinion, it is one ot the
most finifhed eflays in the science '

ke 'in his behalf. I preinme that he will

General La i'avette, previous to his depar
ture frofn th'e French lervice :
" Citizen Soldiers.
"It is no longer time to conceal from
you what is going forward ; the constitu
tion you ("wore to maintain is no more ; a
banditti from Marfeiiles, and a troop of
factious men besieged the palace of the
Thnilleries ; the naf'onal and Swiss guards
made a vigorous refinance, but for want of
ammunition they were obiiged to furren
:ler.
" General d'AfFrey, hisaid;-'.!e-camp, and
his whole family were murdered.
" The king, queen, and all the royal fa
mily escaped to the national afi'embly ; the
factious ran thither, holding a sword in one
(land and the fire in the other, and forced
the legislative body to ftiperfede the king,
wliicii was done for the fake of saving ins
life.
" Citizens âyou are no longer represent
ed ; the national assembly are in a state ot
(lavery ; 'yotir armies are without leaders:
Pethion reigns ; the favaoe Dalton and hi>

your province to exami-ne whether you will

STATE OF PARIS.
This great capital is perfectly calm, tho'
patriot'ifm wk* never kr.e'.vn to be lb much
alive ; it is the welcome guest of every ho
nest heart; there is no, not even the (mail
ed,appearance of the late crisis ; all is har
mony, concord and peace. The play-hon
les are open ; commifTaries, men of literary
talenis, have been appointed by the variotj3
lections to read over and examine the new
pieces, before they are introduced to the
pbblii eye'.
Almost all the theatres have given a be
rrcnt for the relatives of such as expired
gloriously on the roth of Augustâthe ne
ver-tOTbe-forgotten iocli of Atlgnft ! Tha
ariflocrars and loyalists are alone in a state"
of anxious solicitude ; some of them trem
ble ; many of them are machinating plots
of which, as usual, they will become the
devoted victims.
Several houses have been thrown down
in the neighbourhood of the royal refi
dcnce. The inhabitants h.-.d offered imjtrf
tifbble inftilts to Louis XVI. and his fami
ly as they walked for air in the garden. â
The municipality destroyed the effe&s by
rooting away the cause- Now when the
king walks in the garden, all the workmen
tmployed in digging the foffe have orders
to retire. He is only accompanied by a
muaicipal officer ; the imperial blood of
Aiitoniette cannot bear to be fide by fide
with a tradesman of Paris : she fignifies her
rlifcontent-by her looks ; but the tradesman
Joes his duty, and walks cheek by jowl with
:he daughter of the Gefars.
Nobody is differed to leave tke temple,
:he guards excepted, without being lear
ned.
Louis is as careless and fat as usual. The
noting prince is as lively as ever ; the pretty
nnocent never committed a crime; he
loes'not know what remorse is. May he
De always equally ignorant of vice and its
:ancamitant evils. 1
Wq just hear, that MarTlial Luckneir has
efigned his command. We do not take
.ipon otirfelves toaffertir as a fact, but we
hink it more than probable.
Meflrs. A. Lameth and LaTour-Mau
>ourg, snd all the Raff-officers of the army,
aave followed La Fayette.
M. La Tour-Manbourg was one of the
members of the constituent assembly ho
"ent to Varennes to bring back the fugitive
king.
There is not a flcady, impartial friend to
:he fiiblime cattle ot freedom, but grieves
r.ofl sincerely for rhe very unpleasant al
ercations which lately took place between
.he legislative body and M. La Fayette, and
.vhioli ended in the emigration of that
,'oung general.
His excellency loi"d Gower is still de
atned in Paris. He cannot proctfe his
saflports for himself and his attendants. â
The present is a tempestuous moment, and
rtiquette mnft be laidafide. His excellen
:y had declared he had not a French fer
ant in his suite. Lord Gower it seems,
ias been very liberal in g.iving pafTports to
French peoDle. The assembly do not ap
prove of such onrcioufnefs.
State of Europe, lu'.th refpefl to France.
The secretary for foreign affairs rose, and
;ave the following state of Europe.
Sweden. That kingdom had already tef
ified pacific intentions. Government rc
'ufed to enter into the league against
France. Several Swedifli officers wifted to
je employed in the French service. The
â egency made proposals for a commercial
ntercourfe.
Rujfia That empire never concealed its
loftile views; but it could only threaten
Franc# for a loi'g time to come.
The fouthem Courts were in the fame cafe.
The German Empire was combined against
France.
Holland That republic promised the
11 oft perfeit neutrality. The Dutch am
baff.idor remained in Paris.
Great-Britain- That empire profeffed cx
neutrality. The Britilh ambaifador had
orders from his court to quit France ; but
nothing hostile was iufinuated in the man
date. The Englifti government observed
to him, that as the executive power had
been taken out of the king's hand, his cred
entials were no longer valid or of any ef
fect ; and that it was hi duty to withdraw
without loss of time. His British majefly
continues perfectly neuter,but did not think
he would invade that neutrality, by de
manding that the lives of Louis XVI. and
his family (hotild be protected. He ex
pected that no violence would be offered to
tlieir persons, as that would awake the in
dignation or dil Europe. Authorized by
t lie executive power ad interim- the secre
tary for foreign affairs had written to the
English ambaifador and teftiiied how much
the French desired to continue in amity
with a great people, who were the firft to
acknowledge the sovereignty of nati
ons.
Marshal Luckner has proved himfelf un
worthy of the confidence placed in him by
a free and generous nation ; his very versa
tile conduct for some time past appeared
more than suspicious ) and the patriots who
blazoned forth his 'pretended virtues, have
now to blufli for their extreme credulity.
We have fcen him alternately lavifli his
blame and- commendations on la Fayette;
submit to the will of that fc'neming young
general, or follow the r.dvice of the firll
who hazarded an observation to him ; andafterwards complain of the ptvfons whb
were about him ; he was the grand and
sole cause of the diffencions that prevailed
in his army. After having written to the
legislative body, and protested he was the
sincere friend of French liberty, hefpoke to
his army in quite d.uerent terms ; he got
upon horseback and rode thro' the ranks,
lamenting the misfortunes of Louis XVI.
and wilhing for his refioration ; he even
added, tint the horse he then rac'e was a
present made to him by the good kins.
It Was hard to think, indeed, that mnn,
whose foil had a command in the Imperial
army, and who had very ccnndei able land
ed property in Germany himfelf, would
fight against the emperor. For which rea
son lie always proved himfelf a time-ser
ver. He was a democrat or a loyalist, ac
cording to place, time, and circumstances.
It was evident, from the fluctuation and
incertitude of his principles, ti. it he had no
leading charafler ; that he obeyed the im
pulse of the momeat; and, in fiiort, that he
was infinitely better calculated to com
mand a flying camp of Hullans, than to di
rect the operations of an army of free
Frenchmen.
The Imperialists and Pruffinns begin to
infect our frontiers, and commit every kind
of depredation. Several French detach
ments attack and repel them. They seem
at once to threarcn Thionvilie, Movenwic,
and Longwy. Our army is becoming more
f.) rnndable everyday: reinforcements are
Pouring in upon us without interruption :
patriotism cannot fwcll higher in even
breift.
Paris, Aua;- 25. The former {lately pa-

there is question of levelling it to the earth,
that the dwelling of so many tyrants may
no longer offend a free people. a:'d put

Yefterdav evening between five and fix
o'clock, M. La Porte, '.are keeper of the pri
vate purse, condemned by thefpecial tribu
nal to be beheaded on the Rjliate of Carou
zel, underwent his sentence in presence of
a:: imiaenfr croud of fpeCtators-.
1 he jury, after a trial of four and twen
ty hours, convicted him of having made an
improper use of the civil lift, in order to
foment a eivil war.; it appeared evident
ly on his trial, that he h#ul hired incendiary
writers, whose poisonous productions ten
dered to defeat the exertions of all the
friends ofliberty.
â M. la Porte went fothe block with a for
titude and refohition worthy of a better
and more just cause. He however, de
clared his innocence to the last ; but the
written proofs produced in court, are inde
libte leftimocies of his guilt and perfidy.
M. la Porte was turned off fifty. He
wasdreffedin a new suit of silk clothes,
â¢ aud appeared as much unconcerned as if he
was going to the levee of his late mafier.

Mcubeuge Aug. 2r âCol, Dampierre, at
the head of a detatchmcnt of 300 men,
marched against a party of Imperialists,
ported at the bridge of Solte, though it
rained so violently the whole night, that
above 100 loldiers loft their {hoes in the
heavy roads; the detachment marched 3
leagues in 3 hours ; and appeared in the
presence of the enemy at the break of day.
Were it not fdr the impetuous r.rdour of
30 dragoons, that were ported to cut oflt
the enemy's retreat, the French infantry
would have been fnrroinded and taken.
The imperia,! huflars owed their lives to

proceeding to Saar-Louis.
Both coliimns consist of about jo,ooc
men. It fee ins to be their plan to divide
them into two bodies; one third of which
is to besiege the two above mentioned pla

Mr. FreneAu,
ON perusing your paper of Wedr>M'iy
the 24th iuft. I found a piece signed
Medicus : on reading it I perceived it con
tained infiiniationÂ«, which if they were true, ,
u'ould totally destroy the medical charac
ter of Dr. Barton, at whom it is chiefiv
; but, fir, I beg leave to inform you
that the author of Medicus was au inter
ested man, and a man who has plainly pro
ved that some private pique has been the
cause of his thus publicly attempting to
traduce the character of a gentleman, who
has always diltinguifhed himfelf as a man
worthy the countenance of the world. Me
dicus infniuates that Dr. Barton was author
of the letter, the extract of which was pilb
lifiled in New-York and republilhed in Phi
ladelphia. On this part of the Aibjeft I
thai! not fay more than that Dr. Barton's
acquaintance, I believe, are too well' con
vinced of his honor to think he would
be guilty of so base an act. I hope the
'â aufe of Medicos'? appearing in print, was
not *' because Dr. Barton denied to pub
lish in the Gazette that he was not the au
thor of the above letter." I believe that
was net the sole cause which actuated Me
dicus to take up the cudgel: ] believe, as I
said bstore, that the cause chiefly was a pri
vate pique, and thought thereby to traduce
the character of a man whom he envies, be
cause probably he may be a little superior in
rank. Knvy, Mr. Medicus, may be carried
to great length's, as it has been by you in
this instance, and without any other known
cause.
For my part, I am surprized to fee the
name or title of Medicus, to so scurrilous a
piece, as well scurrilous as
I am convinced you cannot have any pre
tentions to what you stile yourfelfâl am
perfaaded you are nothing in ore than bot
tle-wafuer or bark-pounder to some medi
cinal wasre-houfe.
I would not have you to think, Mr. Fre
neau, that I am anywise interested in this
bufirrefs ; I have not the pleasure of either
of the gentlemen'? acquaintance ; the mat
ter was Rated to me plainly by a difinter
efled person. By publishing these few lines,
you will much oblige your's,

Belidcs i.emp and flit tor , manafaftvirmg, cot

cularly in the southern parts of the state am
Cumberland j and, no doubt, in ft few years
when our settlements extend to the Nachez, cot
ton will be produced in as great perfection as ii
the Eall or Weft-Indies. N > foil or climate cai

Cotton has supplied its place, and its superior ex
celfer.ee, I apprehend, will ahvaya make it amort
profitable manufactory.
The growth of wool will form an importan:
coniideration with us. The plains I have de
scribed, extend quite to the mountains, so tha
iheep he-e may have eveTy advantage which tht
flocks of, Spain enjoy. If we can form any idea
irb.n th,-lamplis of waol produced in many part!
of the country, we may cortclude that our mod
sanguine expectations will be fully answered.
The buffalo are mostly d.-ivenout of Kentucky.
Some are Itili found upon the head waters 01
i'eking creek, Great Sandy, and the head waten
of preen river. Dee,- abound in the exte.nlivjt
fore-is ; but the eIK confines itfeff rrtoftly to th;
Jbilly and uninhabited places.
"the rapidity of the settlement has driven tht
wild turkev quite out of the middle countries, bui
they are found in large Hocks in all our extenfivt
woods.
Amidst the mountain? and broken countrie'
are great numbers of the grouse I have d-fcribed :
and lince the fettleracnt has been eftabliflied, tlw
quail, by following the trail of grain which is ne
cessarily fcattersd rhrnigh the wilderness, has mi
grated fc-on( the old ftttlertients on tbe other fiJt
the mouoSfin, and has beiorn: a cnn.lant resident
witb us. This bird was unknown hereon the
firit peopling of tbe country.
There is a variety of wild fowl in every part 0
thisfta'e, particularly the teal, and the fummer
duck. The latter breeds with us. Its incuba
tion is always in temperate cli nates, which is tht
reason of irs being called the summer duck.
The nroduftions of Cumberland are nearly th;
fame aj'thole of Kentucky. The quality of to.
bacco is perhaps something better ; but the cli
mate being considerably warmer, it is not so fa
vourable to wheat and bar ley, nor does grass grow
there so luxuriantly as with us.
The country below Cumberland soon becomei
war.cn enough for indigo and r|#e ; and perhap*
these articles, in a few years, will he cultivated
on the MifiiCippi with as much success, if no',
more,'than they ever were in South-Carolina 01
Georgia.; particularly the former, as the foil on
the Miffifippi, is infinitely more luxurimt than
any whatever in the Garolinas. Someeflays wert
made in this bufmefs, previous to the late war j
but the object was abandoned in the deltruflion
of the settlement I mentioned in a former letter,
made below the Natchez-
Orangts, and other tropical fruits, grow it tht
Natchez, and fame distance above, to confidey
ble perfection.' There are a variety of nuts which
grow both i i Kentucky and Cumberland, some
of which Â»re common to bath ; the molt remark
able of which is the pacane i but as they have
all been noticed, both by Caiver and JeffeWon, I
Ciall refer you to them for their particular def-
Criptions and properties. Grapes, plumbs, goof,
berries, and ilrawberries, grow also fpontaneoull)
in the fiuthem parts Â®f Kentucky and in moll
parts of Cumberland.
' The produce of the western country will b<
nearly the >aÂ»e in tbe parallels of latitude
f-hrouÂ»hoUt, <b that comparing my imaginary
states, with the fettled country south-east of th<
Ohio, you will be able to form a just idea of wha'
thev will be capable of producing. But to com
prehend the objefl of the commerce of this coun
try, it is lirft m-ieffary to contemplate it, abound
ing in all the comforts of life, limited in its vari

a foil so prolific, a navigation so cxteufive, and ;
lecurity fÂ® permanent from being inland, that i

The navigation of this couutry has been muct
talked of. The diitance from one place to
iher has been compared with some decree of ac

been ma<je confirm the opinion that its difficu-kj
is merely imaginary.
The common mode of descending the stream i:
in flat-bottomed boats, which may be built frorr
15 to 50-j toni burthen. But, as tar as I hav<
been able tojudge, I ihould tuppofe, that aboul
50 or 60 cons burthen would be the rnoft conveni
ent, wieldy and consequently fate, particular!)
.vhj ft the waters are very high, for in such cale!
[lie rapÂ»dity of the current makes it difficult ti
mananje an unwieldy mat's with facility. Theft
Doats are built of oak plank, with a certain pro
j.ortion of breadth to their length, i. e. nearly as
1 1 feet to 4.0 j which will be a boat of nearly 4:
tons. They are covered or not as occasion muv
reunite. The objedk is to build thedi as cheap a
poltiblc, for their unwiei Jinefs prevents the po( â 
nbilitv of their returning, and they can only be
iold as plank'
Several of these boats letting out together) lei
us fuppc.fe 5, 10, 15, or 20, ot 60 tons burthei:
each, which would reunire each 6 hand* to navi
gatt" :hv-m. The boats theft of 60 tons each will
enaploy 6o hands, which will be equal to
up the ftrea.n 3 bjats of ; tons each, and which
would be more than fufficient to bring back the
cargo which th<e pi oduce of the ten boats vyouh
purchase ; as the articles we export ar.eg<ofs anc
bulky, while we want only in return fuperfinc
goods ; the coarler goods of every fort will always
be manufactured in the country. WÂ«c also make
our own fait, sugar, spirits, malt liquor, and thai'
soOn make our own wine. These boats must be
worked up with steam and fails.
The invention of carrying a boat againtl the
stream by the influence of steam is a late im
provetflfnt in phi'ofophy, by Mr. Rumfey ot ,r "
ginia, whose ingenuity has been rewarded by tnat
date with the exclusive privilege of navigating
those boats in her rivers for io years ; and as this
wis given previous to the independence ot
Kentucky, the aÂ£V of feparacion guarantees his
rigor. Some circumstance or other has prevented
his bringing them into use. However there can
be no doubt of the fuceefs of his scheme, for the
assembly of Vifg'nia had the most unequivocal
afiurances before they gave the privilege, in a cer
tificate signed by General Wafbmgton and Man
pjge Esq. setting forth that they had seen a boat
.vhich they believed to be conflra&ed by Mr.
Rumfey, ascend a stream without the aid ot ma
nual labour,but. without mentioning the operat
ing caufc, which has tince appeared to be fleam,
[f this principle fliould fail (and from such autho
rity 1 do not conceive how it is to be presumed ),
[ Hatter myfelf that philosophy is capable of fup
jlying the place in the appropriation ot some one
>f the fccrets with which mechanics abound.
in taking a retrofpeftiv-e view ot the world, we
are for a moment fur-priced when we recollect that
fume rhoufands ccf years had elapsed before print
ng was invented, aiid that the only way of ac
rucxiulat'rng the copies of art and genius was by
[he tardy method of transcribing j and that the
art of navigation was fÂ«r nearly as long a time de
vious, and regulated by-no certain laws, the {tars
and head lands of different countries being the on
ly guides to the adventurous iTiariner who often
pcrithed when the heavens were obfeured. O lib
