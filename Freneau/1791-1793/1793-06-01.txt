"cUCH is the miserable tyranny now ex
iOing in that country, that men dare
not utter their thoughts on ihÂ«" ailairs of
tiie public, except in parables and alle
gories "]
I believe it is acknowledged that there
is a connexion between our thoughts, in
the day time and our dreams at night ;
we dream when we are neither aflee,
nor awake, but in some middle state, and
hence it is that dreams are often very con
futed things, and there is very little ftrtf
in general to be laid np&n them. But
sometimes they have been of importance
and truly prophetic ; I cannot how ever
call my dream a prophecy, it does not
seem to prognofiicate any thing ; having
been in tha habit of thinking, though at
present I do not think it fafe to speak free
ly concerning political matters, it is very
natural to suppose that I flionld dream of
them ; and as it is my opinion that I can
not be punished for either thinking or
dreaming, and though I might be prosecu
ted for publilhing my thoughts, yet as
dreaming is perfectly involuntary, I think
I may venture to publish my dream, but a
friend of ini :e told me that though dream
ing is involuntary, the act of telling or
publishing the dream is voluntary, and
therefore cognizable ; I therelore laid
aside the thought of publishing my dream,
till I mould consider maturely whether
there was any thing in the dream that was
actio ia!>le ; and afier the mofl scrupulous
investigation, I found that it was no mat
ter what the d. earn was, provided it did
not relate to tin's kingdom,our rulers,
our glorious constitution, our mild govern
me t, and truly upright and immaculate
administration. Here I must give a kind
a <1 urefill caution to my fellow;-citizen
not to dream, if pollible, about state as
fa : rs ; but if th ydo dream and cannot
iiefj* it, i ifr- htm s o contrÂ»vÂ£**wf]'y
and means to have the f ene at a great dif
tar.ee from home ; I have pursued this
plan myfelf, and I can dream about poli
tics with the greateit ease, and what is bet
ter, with perfect security. My method is
this, whenever 1 fufpeft that I (hall dream
upon politics, I immediately take up Ro
bi.ifon Crufoe,or Cooke's voyages,and 'ad
about the celebrated ill ind and kingdom
of the former, or the valuable difioveries
of the latter ; or if AnfoVs voyage is not
upon the bigheft fhelf of the library, I
. read his description of Juan Fermandes, or
of Tinian, four times over, by which
means I become perfectly miniated, and
what is more, the island, which is the scene
of my visions, is quite unconneited with
Great Britain and Ireland, and whatever
I may dreain has no relation to any thing
that exists in these regions of knowledge,
peace and liberty.
A few nights ago, the Symptoms of
dreaming were very flrong, and therefore
in all halte I took up Anfon's voyage, and
read the description of Juan Fernandes,
quoties fufficit, that is to fay. four times,
and then putting out the candle,l fell asleep
and beginning to dream, I thought 1 was
on board the Centurion. I saw the beau
tifu. cascade described by the commodore's
hiflorian, and fancied I could have drank
a Scotch pint of it ; indue time I got on
shore, a .d rambled into the woods, leav
ing my cou itrymen occupied at the shore.
I thought the island was inhabited and
soon found myfelf present at a meeting of
the yeomanry of the island, which had
been previously called to decide upon
some political affairs. All of a sudden, I
heard agr at cry of, put out that fellow,
he is an alien. I told them that was my
jnisfortnne, not my fault, that an indivi
dual could not do them any injury, and
that I was altogether in their power be
titles, that I was a citizen of the woi Id and
considered all mankind as brethrenâupon
this I was allowed to"be a fpeftator and an
hearer, hut it was determined that I should
not vote or speak in the meeting, yet a
promise was made, that if I should live ic
years in the island, behave peaceably, and
prudently, and acquiretvvo hundred coc
kle (hells per annufn, real cftate, or two
tnoufand ihells in property, and pay all
taxes, &c. I (hould then be enfranchifed.
Well, the debate commenced, and an el
derly gentleman with an enormous wig,
m ule of goats hair, read some resolutions
expreflive of their high veneration for the
Fernandian Conflitution. He acknow
ledged indeed, comparing the faicl confli
tution to a three man, that two of
S A T U R I>A Y, June i, 1793.
the legs were very much fuelled, and t!ie
other leg for.ew hat withered; but, fays he,
it is better to have this conflitution with
all its faults, and if it had many more,
than to have recourse to physic, efpeiiallv
as the phjficof the island was rather dr-t -
lie, very apt to gripe the bowel;. and
fometimcs brought oil the pile:âHe there
fore concluded a tiring o resolutions,
with the following cbferv tior, uau.elv.
that to plump up the withe. Ed leg, it would
be proper to administer cordials, strong
filh broth, calves feet jiliy, &c. âand ii
these medicines fliouid be ineffe&ual, he
advised that the deficie:icy and deformity
be remedied, by drawing on a great num
ber ofilockir.gs, which would make the
legs look well enough ; from some circum-
Aances I was led to suppose, that the
small leg was the democratic part of their
conflitution.
When this man had done speaking, and
the firft resolution was moved, a.,d the
motion seconded : a little fel ow with a
leal (kin bonnet, rose up and opposed what
I took to be the general ienfe of the meet
ing ; he said, molt rashly and impertinent
ly, that there was no conflitution in the
island of Fernandes ; upon which he was
immediately called to order; but he fail!
iie could prove his aflVrtion, and accord
ing y was permitted to proceed, though 1 I
pcrceived that inoft of the old people ii
the afleiiib y were highly provoked at him,
and called him a puppy for presuming to
;loubt what they believed from thÂ« ir infan
cy ; they said they had n ade up their mind'
upon the matter, that they won.d not al
tei their opinions, and that if they had no
confluution it was better for foeie y to be-
e that they had one, and that it was a
gijod one ; now this I highly approvtd of,
nut Squileito. that being the name of the
little jackanapes, said that wherever the
i uling power is absolute, there can be no
conflitution, unlef the will of the filler;,
he the conflitution, and then it lnuft be si;
aucfi- i i.lcr many realoris,
nat it coulu not de ene the name of a
oonftitution, becfiuCe every time the rulino
powers chaiged their Rii d,the conflitution

of govei rimenain Fernaiules is I'o organi
zed, that the feverai power - can < heck and
balance each other ; this is a business be
tween themlVlvesâaril when they have
fetrled these ir. ..ter to their faii.sf.,Â£lion,
ano have jgreed to make and exeiute eer
tain laws, and to impose and levy certain
taxes; then, continues Sqiiletto, the peo
ple of Fernandes are ab oh tely fubji it to
the decilioii of the three branches of their
legillature, and ii there are nu botnds pre
scribed to the power of these th ee bran
ches acting i.i concert, if they can repeal
lawsmadefor the public weal and enatl
whatever they please, the government of
Fernandes is as absolute as that ol ( 011-
llantinople. Now was not this an impu
dent little fellow? what he said would
have been palled over in (ilent contempt,
as no doubt it deserved, had it not been
for the zeal of Glumdug, who thought
t!,at such words were very improper ; he
observed that one of the branches of the
legifiature wascompofed of the represen
tatives of the peoplesrights, and that there
never w is an inflance known of their be
traying their sacred trull, that in their
hands the rights of the people were prr
feftly secure, th .t if it cou.d be fuj p ifed,
(he begged pardon for the very (uppofui
on) that the other two branches of the le
gifiature had any delign 10 encroach upon
the liberty of the kibp-ci, the reprefei.ta
tive body, would, eve.y man of them, lay
down their lives rather than betray their
conflituents. What, fays he, will any
man dare to fay that we have no conflitu
tion, because we have no written instru
ment agreed upon by the people, either
by themfeives or by their representatives
as a constitutive aflembly ? if the people
have never made a constitution for them
selves, what then ? there has been one
made lor them, and a better one than they
could ever have made, or ever can make ;
this conflitution is written on our hearts,
and we w ill maintain it, and we w ill not
reform any of its abuses ordeftfls if it has
any, because this would be too great a
coiidefcenlion, and would encourage the
people to go further from time to time,
and where this would end no body know
At this time an officer with a guard, ar
rived, and took Squiletto into cuflody,
and one of the halberdiers turning round
gave me such a thump upon the nose with
the end of his halbert that I awoke, and 10,
it was but a dream.

LONDON, April 8.
Counter Rev lution in France.
THE accounts of the different defeat!
Experienced by the French army, which
reached Paris in fucceflion almost daily,
produced the molt general confirmation
among all ranks of people. Among the
members of the Convention in particular,
the alarm was very great. Different mem
bers denounced General Dumourier as a
base traitor, who, preferring gold to the
love of his country, had received bribes
from t ,eir enemies, as an ambitious villain,
who, under the maSt of patriotism, had
used every artifice to attach the aimyto
himfelf, to seduce the soldiers of the re
public from the duty they owed to their
country ; and to destroy those in battle
Wliom he could not corrupt by his flatteries.
Different letter-, from general Dumou
rier, and coiiverfations which he had held
yith the commilfioners in Belgium, in
which he plainly told them the prelent form
of government could not be maintained,
w ere produced in support of these charges,
in winch it was all.dged, he olfered the
grossest infnlt to the convention, the re
prel\ntatives and defenders of the sove
reignty of the people, by taking upon him
the office of legdlator ; dictating to them
the conduct they lhonld follow; cenfnring
tile laws which they had palled in the name
of the sovereign people, particularly the
decree of the 10th of December, and fub
feqnent laws refpe&ing the organization of
government in those countries, which had
been freed from the yoke of tyranny, and
rellored to their rights as men ; and stig
matizing the members of the convention
who had been sent by them, and acted by
their authority in Belgium, as thieves and
robbersâthereby irnpreffing the people a
mong whom they were, with sentiments
respecting the views and motives of the
convention very foreign to those by which
they were actuated.
The difaflers which had befallen the
French army, the caufcs which operated tc
give the enemy the advantage, and thedif
miffion of the Sans Culottes, whom thej
Jtiled patriots, whom Dumourier could not
corrupt, and had therefore disbanded, were
all urged as proofs of his guilt.
Dumourier, in the mean time, had ar
ranged matters with some of his officers,
and carried his army back into France,
where he soon received intimation from his
friends of the plots laid to ruin him. A
decree ordering him to appear at the bar,
was carried against him in the convention,
and Bournonville, with five of its members,
accompanied by a secretary, were ordered
to bring him a prisoner to Paris.
Of this he was informed before the
miffioners reached his army, and took mea
sures accordingly.
It was Uie opinion of his friends, that,
even independently of the intelligence he
had received, the convention, as a body,
had fliewn an imbccill.ty and weaknefs,on
almolt every occasion, that proved them al
together unqualified to legislate for France,
which they had brought to the brink of
definitionâlt was agreed, that means
fliould be followed to impress the army
with proper sentiments respecting the con
duit of the convention, in numerous in
stances, and particularly towards their gen
eral, who had shared every danger with
them, whose valour they had all Witnefled,
and whole trood CO: ul(K"t alone had preser
ved them from entire definition, and en
abled them to make a good retreat from
a country which hael received them as
friendi ;.nd brothers, but which had be
come their enemy by the unjust ex.- .Hons
levied by order of the convention, and the
cunfltaints put upon their freedom after
the honour of the French nation had been
pledged that they (hould be left at free li
berty to chute their own form of govern
ment.
The army, by the read'.nefs -with which
they agreed to fnpport their generals, (hew
ed, th.a before it was proposed, they were,
almolf to a niin, inclined to put an end to
the tyranny of the convention. Want of
individual confidence alone had prevented
them from proclaiming their sentiments to
each other before.
We have net room to give a long detail
of the subsequent bulinefs. Suffice it for
the present to lfate, that the general voice
was tor reltoring, with a few modifications,
the cenftitution decrecd by thefirft orcon
ltituent assembly, viz. a limited monarchy.
âIt is eren believed, that Tome of the
commillioners themselves approved of the
meafnre.
When the commiflioncrs, on the firfl of
April, reached the army, they were put
under arreit, and sent next day with an es
cort to the Auflrian army, as prisoners of
war, and hoftagesfor the fafety of the roy
al family.
In the letter which Dumourier sent with
them to Clairfayt, he calls the dauphin the
young king, and oft'ers some of the frontier
towns as a security that he would perform
the promise he had made to overthrow the
Convention, and reflore a monarchical
government âThe comni'ffioners are now
faftly lodged in the Citadel of Antwerp.
The French army has mounted the white
cockade, and dilpatches from the duke of
York, and Sir James Murray, confirm the
intelligence that Dumourier has set out
for Paris.

To the PRESIDENT of the
UNITED STATES.
S I R.
\7IF.WING you merely in the charafler
* of iii It magiltrate of that country, of
which I ani a citizen, and knowing yon to
t>e amenable to yotir fellow citizens for
Conr official conduct, I lhall make 110 apo
ogy for calling your attention to thelol
lowing obfervacious which I communicate
through the channel of a public print, be
cause the subject is one in which the Ame
rican public is deeply interested.
When you iflued a proclamation, decla
ring on the part of the United States, a
Itriit impartiality and frietidjhip towards
ill the belligerent powers, from the double
motive of iuty anc! interejl, it might rea
[Yinably hive been expected that you would
liave rendered vourftlf cltarly intelligible
:o the citizens of America, and to the
worhl ; and that nothing mjfteriotls or of
double meaning would have been promul
jed by the ele&ive executive of a fres
.ountry. Whatever has the appearance of
double dealing ; whatever favours of mon
archical mystery or court intrigue ; what
?ver may have a tendency unnecessarily to
controul the sentiments or infringe the
privileges of the peopleâhowever fafhion
able such things may be in the corrupt
:ourts of Europe, they ought surely to be
rejected, with abhorrence, by those tempo
rary magistrates to whom are committed
the concerns of the American republic. As
the proclamation has not the mod distant
allusion to the treaties exiting between
France and the United States, there is room
tor ftirmiling, that those treaties, from
which we have long enjoyed important ad
vantages, are now to be considered as of no
obligation, ai d this, 1 believe, is the light
in which many have confirued the pro
clamation.
But, if this be the true conftruftion, how
can the proclamation be conlidered as con
fident either with our duty or interejl ?
With our duty it cannot accord, so long as
eve pretend to any faith as a nation, or re
member, with gratitude, the circutnftances
under v hich our treaties with France were
concluded, and the generous exertions of
hat nation in the cause of American li
berty. It it be the duty of a free nation to
forget those friends to whom she is in a
jreat mealure indebted for a national ex-
Itence ; to view with cold indifference the
ftruggtes of those very friends to support
their own liberties against an host of *lef
pots ; and, in spite of the reciprocal ties of
national treaties, to treat an inveterate and
:ruei enemy with the fame friend/hip a'
t>ur belt and molt faithful ally.âlf such be
the duty of Americans, as declared in the
proclamation, then is that proclamation to
3e regarded as difgraceful to the American
:haraÂ£ter.
With respect to that line of conduit which
interejl requires America to observe, per
mit me to remark, that it never can be
confident with the interest of a nation,
basely to disregard its plighted faith, and
thereby incur that difgraceful character for
which ancient Carthage became prover
bially infamous among the nations of the
earth. Let me hint further, that it is by
no means confident with the interest of
the United States to provoke the French
nation 10 hostilities; a cor.sequence natu
rally to be expected from the violation of
foleimi treaties.
It has been u*gencroufly fuggeficd by
many ihat we run no danger ot being in
volved in the war with Fiance, how ever
infatjious our conduct towards her may be,
" For, fay they, ft will be for the inureji
of France that America Ihould not be en
gaged in the war, but be left to fnrniih
Lhoie fnpplies as a neutral nation which are
so neceiiary to the fultenance of her army
during the war."âThese Solomont, howe
ver, may find themselves ntiltaken. Franee,
tho'delirous of peace and frleudfi'.ip with
us, is surely not intenfible to injury; neither
is (he so abjeÂ£t as tamely to submit to an
open violation of faith by any nation.â
RWt-rving some further obfervationi for a
future letter, I shall not at this time tref

May 30th. VERITAS.
For the National Gazette.
Citizen Fret/eau,
tT would appear by the sentiments of an
- anonymous writer in Mr. Dunlap's pa
x-r of Saturday, that the farmers ol Penn
ylvania are not only to fubiuit to have their
property violated by a company of interest
(I men, but that it is a higil offence for
[hem to meet together in order to conlider
he bess means ot redress. Such may be the
lady opinion < f an individual, but, forthc
lonor of the Itate, we trull it will not be
:ouud the ientiment of the people. The
e olutions and address of a number of ci
.izens refpefting the turnpike and canal
srojefts, contain no observations that are
not warranted by the occalion, or j.uftified
jy the unexampled injury offered to a free
people.
'I he Legiflatnre and the citizensof Tenn
ylvania have been imposed on by aflertions,
:hat in England, from whence we derive
Hir maxims of government, canals are
I'ound so beneficial that they are never op
jofed. We are warranted in declaring this
jflertion to be falfe. By threats in lome
:afesâby fair promises in othersâand by
bribery, canal companies have in moll cases
;ffeÂ£led their designs. But in feveralinltan
_es they have been fuccef fully oppoied by
Powerful individuals. In March lall, a Mr.
Otirzou opposed the Alhbey
:anal, becanfe its neceflary length & depth
if cutting within the rock which contained
Vlr. Curzon's I'pring, would injure the
pring, by which his house was supplied
ivith water. Mr. Curzon also objeftcd to
he Alhbey de la Zouch canal. because the
ntended course of it would interfere with
lis plan of extending the limits ofhispark.
Although canals may in some itlftances
lave been found beneficial', leading to large
ind populous manufacturing towns ; yet
he increase of them of late years has been
"onnd by experience to be so as
.0 demand the particular interference ot
government. On the 14th of March 1-93,
in the canal bills, all the lords were fntn
moned to attendâLord Stanhope prefent
;d to the House the resolutions refpefting
:anah : and their lordlhipsunanimoufly or
dered that these resolutions Ihould be en
ured on the journals.
111. That no canal bill (hall be read a
bird time in the House of Lords, unless
notice of the intention of tutting such ca
nal shall have been infertcd three times in
:he London Gazette, in the months of An
jult and September, previous to the session
us Parliament, in which such bill Ihzll be
Drought in, and unless a notice lias been
printed in the country papers of the town
hrough which such cailal is intended to be
:ut in the months of August and September.
2d. That these notices shall contain the
lames of the parishes and townlhips, and
of no other, into which such canal, &.c. is
ntended to be cut.
3d. That no bill shall b<? read a third
:ime in the House of Lords unless a map of
:he intended cut has been deposited w it:; t ie
:lcrk of Parliament, describing the line, to
gether with a Sook of reference containing
i lift of the names of the owners ar.d oc
:upiers of such lands refpeftively, with an
innexed eltimate of the expense, signed by
he perfou or persons who are to make the
aine; with also an account of the funis
hen fubicribed, and names of the fub
cribers.
4th. No bill (liould be read a third time
mlefs application has been made to the
owners of the lands through which such
:anal is to pass, for their coi lVnt ; and un
less the map or plan has beiÂ« thewn to such
nwners, diltinguilhing who hasafiented and
who has diflented from such intended ca
lal, and unless the map has been deposited
with the clerk of Parliament.
The arbitrary and unjust principles of
the canal and turnpike law s, and the inso
lent and abusive manner in \\ hich they have
been thus far carried fcito effect, occalioned
the late meeting of the farmers, and w ill
occasion others for the purpole of procur
ing redress. In pursuing this bulinefs, so
highly interesting to onrfelves, we shall ait
with fkmnefs, but decency ; and if our
conduit Ihould offend some individuals w ho
may be interelfed in supporting the eviU a
gainst which we complain,we are willii gto
;>ive such characters any personal futisfai:ion
they may require, but shall not difgtate
our cause, or stain the public prints, with
language unbecoming freemen, in ahfaer
to an) ribaldry or abuse of anonym its wri
ters.
Whatever mpy lie niir prefe-t opinion of
turnpike and canal incorporated companies
we are opt 11 10. cor.vicTum, and wouid en ink
any real friends to tile improvements of our
country, to come forward and prove by
fair argument, that it was not the duty of
the legillature on this novel a id important
occasion, to h'ive con.'ulfed their conltitu
ents, * that previous to their enaciing the
laws, the fame caution of violating p. irate
property fliould not have taken place as has
been purlued by the parliament of Great-
Britainâthat the laws are not highly inju
rious and unjult toilie agricultural interest,
or that they will finally prove beneficial to
the commonwealth.

Extract of a tetter from a gftleman in
New-York, dated May 28, to his friend in
this city.
"The fum'of advices received by the April

lenders. The fubferiptions were finally
made up through the i: tinencr of jobbsaml

ployed by Pitt himfelf, and n< thing but a
gleam of success from Holland has hither
to saved the nation from a dreadful con
vulsion, which would yet be inevitable,
(hotild an/thing serve to throw America
into the scale of opposition and a union with
France in the prelent wit. âIn addiiion to
the above (which is exirafted from fevtral
letters) a friend of the best information in
London thus writes to n;e â¢ " The Arr.< â¢
rican government has now an opportunity
thaf may never retL-rn, of ftctiririg their
western commercial interests tipon its own
terms, provided Britith men ;Â»ni( Bririfh
measures 2re not too deeply interwoven in
the councils of America, and lliameful fa

After dinner was over, frveral hymns sa

As the Americnn citizens were preparing,
to leave the frigate, citizen Dtyoi.t, the

Chosen as an afjlum, during the present

French Republic in the Windward If],
ands, to the C tizen Minider Genet,
at Philadelphiaâdated Port-au Prince,
May Bth, 1793, 2d year of the French
Ivepubhc.
WE fee 1 how efTenti'alit is, that the
United States, infeded as they
are by emigrants from St. Domingo, fhoulc
learn the truth of events thro' the agent:
of the republic.
" From the month of Janury lad a new
Coalition formed between the chiefs of the
Royalids and those of the Rebels, excitec
for iome time pad by the English govern
merit, menaced the intereds of the metro
polls. Their activity was such, that i
our presence in the western province hac
been delayed another month, it would havt
been extremely difficult to remedy the evil
r^ n arm y obtained by the governor ir
chief Lafalle encamped at a league's dif
tance from Port-au-Prince, on the 9th o
April We were in the haibour with ;
74 gÂ»n ship and two frigates. The gate:
were shut and admittance refufed to th<
armies of the republic; Fuinaces wen
ereaed in the forts to heat th.- balls thai
were to be fired on our vefTcls. Having
information of the declaration of war with
England we could not temporize. W<
summoned the municipality to receive tlit
army, the general and us. The rebels re.
luted.âHaving used every lenient means
promised fafety and liberty to the friend:
of the republic, granted a delay of 2 a
hours upon the requed of some deputies
from the townâa delay which was mifufec
in endeavouring to corrupt the crew wt
gave orders to the ship and frigates to fin
on the forts. This was the 12th of Apri
at fix in the morning ; our fire was answer
ed by bombs and red hot fliot.
The conted laded fix hours and only
ceased when we succeeded in silencing the
fire from the town. On the 13th we re
ceived a deputation who asked another de
lay to give the good citizens time to afTem
'. w e granted it with pleasure, and w,
received at the fame time the women anc
children who were flying from the town,
" Next day the general was quietly re
ceived at the head of his army. We land
ed and ordered a number of rebels to bt
arretted. The principal chiefs, Borel I
their head, had fiown. The fire from the
town only killed us two men, the loss oi
the rebels amounts to 30 at mod ; but whal
is remarkable is, that our fl.ot feeme 1 tc
jingle out the mod turbulent among them ;
such as fiord's nephew, and 3 or 4 public
a.lafiins known thio'out the island.
" This day every thing is ptrfedly quiet
and we hope, that internal peace will con
tinue,notwithdanding the machinations anc
agitations of the enemies of France.
" Tell free Americans, and the friend,
of the republic, that the colony has at
length found severe executors of the laws
that we have put to flight the enemies oi
i- raneeâenemies so much the more dange
rous, as under the mask of national colours.
they made war upon their mother country
with its own weapons. Tell them, thai
thele pretended patriots, Borel (till al
their head, have jiift given a lad proof of
their attachment to the intereds of tin
mother country by flying to Jamaica, anc
throwing themfelres into the arms of the
â¢hnghfh."

" I seize the opportunity of the frigare
Concord bound for the Cape, to give yo,
an idea of what is passing in France. YOl
have been a witness to the war in the Wed
Jncia colonies, & I afTure you we are muci:
in the fame situation here. The fame mon
iters that excited disturbances in the colo
nies, have a<3ed the fame part in France,
ihe pcafantry in several parts of the coun
try have followed the example of the Hi's
paniola negroes, though with less reafor
on their fide. Such an effect have the fa
liatical exhortations of the refra&ory prieds
had on them, that they firmly believe thev

they are killed. In the neighborhood o r this
city theyare wholly reduced,but multitudes
of these ui,happy wretches mud perish be

It.II they are not deterred. All polls an:
Hopped. In addition to the general league
of al, nations againfl us, we have a civil
war at home infinitely more alarming than
the efforts of the molt powerful external
enemies. Beside all .his we are peered
with traitors in abundance ; notwithftand

to death by these miscreants, and numbers
of houses pillaged and burnt, pamculailv

We have a bloody war upon our hands,
but 1 am confident we (hall rife fuperio,
to all enera.es. lam now at Breit, em.

a fleet now ready to go on a cruise along
the coasts to prevent an invasion. The
people of Nantz have re-taken St. Lazare
and Croifee. In the Litter place were more
than 200 emigrants killed at one (ingle dif.
charge of our artillery. The patriots have
been surprized through want of vigilance

ier fay,betrayed.Howeverthe brigands arc
now put to complete rout. The guillotine u
