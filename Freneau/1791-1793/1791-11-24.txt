A Political enquiry into the bcjl weans oj
improving the Commerce oj the
American States.
[Continuedfrom our lajl.j
[In this part oj his addrjs, the author proves jrov,

every proper means, to exert its endeavors to pro
cure Jrom Europe and <ljc where, perjbns jkilkd ii

in this country. ]
IN order to prevent the fruits of oui
agricultural and commercial indus
try from centering wholly in the hands
of ft rangers, it is abfoluteTy necessary
for the United States to preserVe a uni
ty of interests among themfclves ; the
firft object of which union of inter
ests should be, the putting it out bf the
power of any body of men, an individu
al, or a foreigner, to thwart Tucii mea
sures as should be taken to promote the
national commercial advantages in view:
and to plate things on such a footing,
that the plans and machinations of fo
reigners Jhould rather be made to co
operate in the success of those beneficial
defigns.âln a word, every step taken
by government ought to be ditlated bv
the idea of the national interest at large,
*Â»hich ought to be considered as the
central point of all their operations.
This principle being established, I
would go on to observe, that the greal
aim of every wife adminiftratien ought
to be to protest, and give a dire&ion tc
national mduftry in its infancy ; ana
even to make considerable facfifices, il
necelfary, to ensure success to all thai
class of people engaged in the produ&ion
of raw raau:ri*U, arid the proi'ecation ti
those arts, which are considered among
the ujejul in every country.âTo delay
time in proving so evident a principle
as the preceding, would be absurd ; be
eaufe there is no example in history, oJ
its having ever been controverted.
This leading idea in our mercantih
system, naturally ipduces an enquiry
into the moll proper means of encou
raging the cultivation of those arti
cles which afford the means of manu
factures and arts, and are the common
cause of their rlouriihing in any part ol
the world.
Manufactures are, in themselves, oi
little confequente without the aid of the
arts ; deprived of which they are nevei
known to succeed to any considerable
degree. For the encouragement o
them, all wife governments have evei
found it their interest toeftablifh school.
for drawing, engraving, painting anc
c.icmiftry, that by the alliftance ot theft
their arlifts might be enabled to ad
vance their fabrics to the utmost de
gree of perfection. These arts only, i
well followed, are of inestimable valut
to the nations that encourage them, b 5
exempting them from a tribute, which
(previous to their making them thei:
own)theypaid to their neighbours, ir
the purchafeof their merchandize.

W , Icn le intelligent legislators
ana patriots of former times were ena
bled to do such immense lervicesto their
country m promoting their fabrics and
inventions, did not history step m to
our afiiftance.â To history, then, anci
ent, and modern, let ty recur for inform
ation ; there we {hail fee detailed at
full length the various particulars, a
knowledge of which is necelfa-ry for pro
moting the public weah
In all the wife governments of anti
quity we may constantly observe an ar
dent desire and emulation to encourage
the growth of the liberal arts.
Uiemiftry, encouraged by the bounties
0 f P v ereigns, set men upon exploring
the bowels of the earth and bringing to
light the secrets of the mineral world.
1( was this encouragement alfb that de
'/eloped the nature of plants and â¢vege
ables and blended their various colours
n such a manner as to contribute to
he pleasures and luxuries of life. The
rompofition called glass, the artificial
Known by the na ne of porcelain,
ind that beautiful gloss called varnish,
ill owe their origin to the encourage
ment which enlightened miniffers have
ifforded to men of oblervation and re-
Itttion. he nature of indigo, faffron,
ind a multiplicity of other precious
plants, hasbeen inveflighted for the pur
poses oi beauty and variety in colou v s,
ind the culture of them has been n
:ouraged in every country, where chc
:limate has fuffered them to prow.
All the arts and sciences keep an edual
3ace with each other ; arid afford a reci
arocal aid. In the department of legif
ation we seen Lycurgus an J Solon,
two of the ftioit celebrated lawg'yersof
iealcuily travelling the whole
A'Orld over, with a view to make new
iifcovgries in science, improve theirown
lnderftandings, and diffufe the know
ledge they had acquired when they re
turned to their own countries, in eit.i
jlilhing the arts, and rendering their
fellow-citizens independent in the pof
effion of them.âWe find talents and
ibilities every where encouraged by the
riends of mankind, and directed to pro
per pursuits. In modern history, with
what an ardor do we fee human indiiftry
waited to the highest pitch ; and how
-apid has been the progreffio'n of know
cage in all enlightened governments !
Peter the Great in Ruflia, Ferdinand in
Pruflia, Lewis the Great in I'ranee, a
niiltitude of German potentates, and,
:o mention no more, all rhe patriotic and
wife Kings of Great-Britain, have ever
:!'-clared themselves the friends and pa
trons of arts and sciences ; and hence it
is, that at this day we fee their respec
tive governments the molt flourishing
and happy in Europe.
Not a few of the(e illuflrious person
ages travelled Europe over to acquire
the requisite knowledge for the establish
ment of every species of manufadture,
and to induce, by their munificence, fo
reign artists and manufacturers to fettle
in their territories, and engage in then
various fabrics. Thus it was that Pe
ter, czar of Ruflia, brought his murine tc
perfe&ionâand Jofcph the fecund, a
great number of manufa&ures before
unknown in his dominions. Henry the
fourth of France entertained precifefy
the fame views: he did not indeed gc
abroad for this purpose in person, but he
employed l'everal of his fubje&s in tra
velling for the fame benevolent en-'. In
his reign, the art of tanning luuiicr was
learcely known in Franceâbut this ex
cellent monarch did noi think it beiow
his rov.il dignity to lead one of his raon
ablt 'anners into Hungary, to difrovei
the fee ret of their method of tanning
The corfequence was, that in a v.ri
short fpÂ»c .* of time France w'*.oi!v
emoted hei- If from a tâ¢ ihutc which iLc
had before annually paid to for*ei-n in
'jfti v, by having been under i!.e ni
tty erf purchafir v, Hungarian ioaliif.r.
By PHILIP FRENEAU.
And thus it has been, that by fove
eigns incurring fomc little expence in
he way of experiments of the above
tFtte- greateit national advantage:
have been found to result. Both Sull)
mdjMontefquieu, during their refpec
tivc administrations, were mvariabh
Dt nt upon using every pofii'ble means t:
make France the feat of the arts. Tht
grea# Colbert followed exactly in th.ei
Heps by eftablHhing certain regulations
which, at the fame time, perfected th<
art of dying, and brought into difreput<
tho - dyes of inferior quality whicl
fraud and ignorance had introduced
I'. 'iad the discernment to know, tha
:h? firft requiiite in every manufaftur
s the goodness of the work, and thai
without a principle of fair dealing anc
>uefty, every species of commerce de

must fali so the ground.âBut
iOt Contented with advancing thus far
ie encouraged manufactures in ge
neral by bellowing premiums propor

Lf we attend to hiflorical information
ve fliall like wife fee that the fame poli
cy was observed by the Empress Man:
I herefa, of Aullria, whole liberalit)
vas luch, as even to bellow large for
unes upon thousands of artists whe
ver? willing to come and set up then
nanufadlories in Germany.
A similar mode of proceeding has in
imes pall proved the ial vation of France.
Ihe time has been when (he purchased
rom her neighbours to the amount ol
nore than fifty millions * yearly, onl\
n the two articles of broadcloths anc
ilk.-i-But no sooner did the French ap
;ly ritpmfelves to the planting of whiu
nulbexry. trees, feeding silk-worms, anci
TTcfci-ving their w'ool, than they lisanu
aftured to the amount of the fame Turn
â verand above their home consumption,
\ similar change took placein the article
'f lÂ»ce, in their trade with the countries
>f Flanders and Brabant.
t rom these {ketches of information, ii
s ealy. to fee, that a nation can, whene
ver it pleases, free itfeif from the tribute
.vhich it may have been accustomed tc
jay to thefuperior induilry of its neigh
)oursâBy encouraging and prote&ing
ileful eÂ£lai?iifhments they may do still
nore, and even advance lo far as to turn
he balance of trade in their favour.
In the whole history of commerce,
lothing is more worthy of admit ui
>n than its progress in Ireland. After 2
edious fuccellion of civil wars, that
:ountry, ravaged, and op
jrefftd, was left a mere delart, the peo
ple difcouvaged and their refouice:
uined. In this situation of things, ;hc
Farl of Eflfex, then Governor of Ireland
oon saw the necellity of re-animating
he drooping fpints of the inhabitants
;nd directing such of them as had ef
t aped from wounds and (laughter, to tht
pursuits of induilry. Lord Eifex, noi
wholly relying upon his own judgmem
111 lo momentous an affair as a genera
reforrqation of the Irish government
confuted the famous Sir William Tern
pie, a very able politician, who Iketchec
out a' plan, which has been attendee
with unexampled fuccel's.âlt would b(
tedious at present to detail the whole o
Sir William's plan atfulliength; fuffici
ent be it to oblerve, that he recommend
ed a ccnfccntious integrity as the baiis up
which the ftru&ure of foreign cor,;
tnerce ought to be built, and withoui
v/hic-.), it cannot poliibly hope ,0 a;; rati
confidence. he, r.cxt. adv : fed Loic
EllpX to encourage the breeding 0! catt'ic
and sheep, and to be particularly atten
tive to the railing of the raw materials
in general suited to the country, whirl'
he regarded as the foul of commerce
. r . tor which there would alwavs be i
maud; as well as for their linens, a
fixed and regular markets. In order tc
e*ft.tÂ« enrdauon. he proposed honour:
and v-orilidcrabte premiums tothofe wh<
* i>7tj J > 000 Â£- PennfyUmnucurrency.
should bring to market, against a fpecifi
, l ; me , one or two pieces of linen, or
doth of the firft quality. This eave
ilie to the Irish manufacturesâlntercc
is the gr id motivfcof action in nun,"and
the multitude are eve/ most open to its
imprelfions..â it was, further, the ad
vice of Sir William, to have an inflec
tion for every fort of merchandize dei
tined to go abroad, in order to prevent
fraudulent prattices, which never fail
to injure the cOmmcrcial credit of a na
tion.
By following such advice Ireland Toon
re-eltablifhed her commerce. Such is
the influence of genius and ability uoon
the prolperityof dates !
But, on the other hand, it may be
asked, whether similar plans v/ould ba
practicable in an infant country, separ
ated by an immense ocean fromEurorie
deftitute of suitable funds, and labour
ing under every discouragement that
European jealouly and European policy
can throw in its way?
To this it may be angered, that the
eitablifhment of a lottery in every state
would in a little time produce a fund
fully adequate to the great object in
view. There is every reason to believe,
ihat, lit a country as famous for its pa
triotic chata&er as America, eve,-- citi
zen, being convinced of the utility of
such an inflitution, would willingly
rilque a trifle of money and thereby
contribute to the welfare of the commu
nity by promoting a lottery which should
have for its object, limply, industry and
exteniion of commerce.
But supposing thcfe funds already
provided, and 11.11 no njaTmta&uies in
the country ; would it not be so much
gfclels money?âl answer, by no meads;
or there might be a thonfand ways m-
Itantly found out to employ it for the
>ooa of the public. Why not, in i.iis cafe,
to tow the example of Henry the fourth
tv 10 lent throughout Europe in search
r , 0 workmen, to inftruft his
3wn fubjefts in France ?âWhy might
lot the profits of these funds be employ
id in defraying the expences of persons
ent on similar errands ? Money thus
employed, infteadof being thrown away
.eedlefsly, would soon gratify us with
i full djfeovery of all those secrets of art
which are so carefully retained in fo
reign countries. Or the money might

be dignified with the name of freedom, it ha:
ieldom been lhaken. The pomp, the pride, ant
external fbtw of grandeur, which attach them
lelves to this kind of government, and arc thi
iuie indication of those weak passions whichari
llways reltrained, whilst the owners ac knowledge
idependenceon the general eUimation of
and as certainly break forth when they confide
:hem(elves elevated it t both captivate an
iwe many. It is a truth which cannot be con
troverted, for it is supported by indelible charac
ters written on the hearts of men, and daily ej
amplified by their conduct, that in a (ound devc
lopement of the various causes which contubut
to the iupport ot those governments, that ar
founded on the ruin of the public liberty, th
inert mechanic force which nerves the arm o
ihe Prince, rauft not be considered as that whicl
is solely influential. In the attempt, therefore
to maintain the ground already acquired, -ox nr
generally to subvert the reigning tyrannies, and
establish free government in their stead, the foÂ»-
micteble array oi armies is not the only danger 10
3e encountered: t!ie deep-rooted interests of
many, and inveterate prejudices of others, mud
>e at.acked and vanquished, before they can hope
for success.
It must be attributed to the propitious direction
>f Providence, that the comparative merits of the
different kinds of government have been submitted
:o the consideration of mankind in aii enlightened
ige. Many of those prejudices which had long
;yrannizedover the faculties of the human mind,
when diverted of their falfe garb, and exposed,
jy the pen of the philosopher, to the sober life of
Lhe reflecting, have already fled before the manly
force of reason, like the morning mifl at the pre-
Fence of the radiant fun. 'Tis to be hoped, there
fore, that, in a question of such high importance
:o their lasting welfare, the mere force of preju
dice will not be able long to blind their under
[landing or pervert their judgment.
By the revolution in America and France, and
particularly the former, a fair experiment will be
made : the problem which hath been heretofore
so much dil'cuffed, and refpeiting which l'o great
Â£ contrariety of sentiment hath prevailed, whe
ther mankind are capable of felf government, or
whether a body must be organized withoat, ele
vated above, irrefpon6ble to, and holcTing a per
petual scourge over them for that p.;pofe, will
receive a fair and fatisfa<Â£tcry solution. nto their
hands that great mass of power, which, by long
Lifurpation had been confid-. j red thv bjrtÂ£-n>ht and
property of kings, has been I y them is
has been modified, distributed, aiui put in mo*
:ion ; and to the permanent interests, the wifdoni
ind the virtue Cf society, will the lblemn Appeal
:>e made.
Those who have been called to make thisexpe
itnent occupy an interesting theatre. Its.fate 1 will
teach an important lelfon, which wiH be felt for
iges to come and upon it the eyes of all nations
ire fixed with anxious solicitude for the event.
If by the ftabi'.y of their condud, they fliall be
ible to sustain the character and dignity of u the
government of the people," and demon Urate to the
world, that whilst it discards the evil incident to
others, it hath retained all their most ufeful pro
perties, they will have gained a boon which has
been contended for hitherto in vain. They will
â xhibit toother nations an example worthy imi
tation. But those circumstances which promise
[uccefs, make it of the last importance that they
[hould succeed ; for if the prize fHouid be now
wrested from them, the effort will never be made
again. The cause of liberty will be abandoned,
and man' ind, in future, themselves in
under the dominion of a tyrant, and endea
vor, by a blind obedience to his mandates, to mo
derate the rigor of oppression.
To the people of merica, the claim of the pre
sent age and posterity must operate with peculiar
lorce; with them the effort commenced whidj
promises to be produ&ive of such important be
nefits to society. At their Ihrine, the etherial
sre was caught, wliich has already diffufed its
light into the remotest regions. Authors of a
rc v olut;en, and which like a
firft cause upon the proudeil and most enlightened
nations of the earth, they owe it to Hi >1 who
jave them comfort in the day of their distressâ
:hey owe it to themselves and to the cause of hu
nanity, to cherish the principle upon which they
ivfted,âAnd deservedly degraded would they be
n the common estimation of the world, if, after
laving roused their fellow men in other countries,
:o this noble exertion, whilst the confiidi way at

lefired the repeal of the decree in question, by a

That of Brcft on the contrary, demands the exe

hat the AiTembly would be at last compelled .0

E;::ra3 of a letter from a jfentlemati in Charlejlcn
to his friend in t.iu city, dated Nov. 4.
" It has been oblerved by leve.-al foreigners

that the American war was of so tcdio s a du

On Sunday evening last, as three gentlemen,
of this city, were returning from Germantawn,
they were Hopped on the road about one mile
and an half from town by two robbers, armed
with curlaffes, who demanded their money,
clothes, and watches. Owing to some sudden
alarm, however, and some hesitation in comply
ing with their request, the fellows ran off without
accomplishing their purpdle.
We are informed a machine has lately been
invented a: New-Haven, in the Hate of Connec
ticut, to go by water, which takes wool or cotton in
thtir ranrftate; and withoutany, or very trifling
manual labor, car s, spins, and weaves to great
perfection. This machine (out informant fays)
is so invented as to raise water from a pond 01
lake fufficient to keep all its parts in conflant mo
tion. _ , .
A meeting of the inhabitants ot the town ol
Ba limore was adverrifed to beheld on the l6'.h
instant, in order to detetmine on the propriety
and expediency of applying to the General Al
f. mbly of Maryland, now in fcflioa, for an aÂ£t to
incorporate that town.
The General AfTembly of Vermont has passed
a law, laying a tax of one half-penny per acre on
all the lands in that state, for the purpose of rail

charge the demand of the state of New-Yor*
upon them.
Accounts from the windward Islands mention

To the Honorable the Congress of the United
States.
Gentle j.i en,
IN our letter of the 24th of lad August, voi
received inforinaiion of the misfortunes, whit]
had befallen the northern part of this flourifmn;
colony. Our whole force, though very limited
has been levelled against the ravagers, who ar
U in'g it waste ; and we have (o far accomplish
ed our ends, as, if not to effect their total reduc
tion, at leal! to check the evil in its progress
T hat unhappy catastrophe forced the Genera
Assembly of the French part of St. Domingo ti
embrace every means of fafety, indtfpenfable 11
fimilarcates, and rendered neceffaty by the ur
gency of 1 ncumftances; in conlequence o
which, the (hipping in general, and, among tin
relt, the veflels belonging to vour nation, haVi
experienced some little delay in their departure
But, desirous of maintaining that peace and har
aioii)', that i"ubG(t between France (of which wc
ccinftitute a part) and your Hatesâdesirous aifc
of tefiif,'ing, as far as in their power, their grate
ful acknosvledgmtnt of the generous fetvices
offered and rendered to the colony, bv the bravt
fubjtcl- of the United Statesâthe General As
fembly, in conceit with the King's reprefenta
tive, have, in the firft place, lefafide the Droi
d'Aubaine, in favor of such as might fall victim
to their own /.eal and course. The Aflembl'
would have wished to abohfh it forever, and t<
extend the exemption to the Americans in gene
ral; but this object being a conrtitutional point
they intend to jpplv for it to the mother caun
try ; and we have nota doubt, that fhs will ea
gerly gratify our wifhe-.
In the next place, having taken intoconftdera
tion the obllacles, experienced by Mr. Silvanu
Bourne, your consul in this colony, to the regif
try of his credentials âobftaclei, which -were oc
cafioned by certain formal defefctsâthe Genera
Assembly huftened to remove Uieui, and to givt
orders that the fa ; .d credentials Ihould be regit
tered.
Finally, under the cOlttant influence of tliofi
principles of justice and equity, which ceinen
the union between the two allied nations, ant
delirous of corresponding with the views o
France, who will ever hold dear that memora
ble epoch, when (he saw permanent security giv
en to the unlimited freedom of a nation, (hatha
furnilhedher with the florious example, for thi
recovery of her own rights to long mifunder
floodâThe General Assembly have, in favor o
the Americans, hastened to take off the eir,
which the unfortunate fttuation of zi
fails had obliged them to lay on all vessels with
oui dilLnction.
But in vain would the colony have recovers
her former tranquility* if the me&ns of applying
afpeedy remedy to the evil were not to be cm
ployed. The General Assembly have therefor,
determined to fend to your body two new com
miflioners, Melfrs. DeÃeauvots and Payan, wh
are provided with letters from the Assembly am
the King's representative.
The General Assembly do not entertain
doubt, that you will, together with a favorabl
reception to them, give your assent to the requi
fitiens which they ar- etrfpowered to make 0
i'OU, the success of which will undoubtedly ex
tend its influence to the commerce, which th
fubieftsof the United States carry on with tin
colonv.
With this pleafmg hope, we contemplate thei
departure, and direfcf them to the representative
of a generous nation, the friend and ally ofFranc
fince'the year 178 a, the period when (he full;
recovered her liberty.
I have the honor to be,
Gentlemen,
Your moll obedient humble servant,

A petition has been presented to the Afiembi

Susanna, acquainting them that " not bei-n

He therefore requests leave to depart from thi
port, or, if he mi# be detained, that his carg
may be purchalcd at the expence of the colony.
in proceeding on the petition, a member pro
posed a decree, that when any American capfai
(hall not have found a sale for his cargo in th
port within fifteen days alter bis arrival,

the Afiembly) it flwll be lavvlul tor b>rti to Â«j.

the "United States, the petition,of Jacob Ifaacks
<&f Newport, in Rhode-JjJand, has examined in!'
the truth and importance of the allegations tberev
Jet forth y and makes thereon the following
REPORT.
THE petitioner sets forth, that, by variou:
experimeats, with considerable labor anc
;%pence, he hat' discovered a method of convertinj
faU-water into frefh, in the proportion of ?> pint:
aut of 10, bv a process To simple that it may bi
performed on board of veileis at sea by the com-
Bio.i on caboufe Wit'n small alterby ihi
I'ame fire, and in the fame time, which is uiec
for cooking the Ihip's provisions ; and offers tt
:.nvey to the government of the United States 1
faithful account of his art, or secret, to be ufec
by or wkhin the United States, on their giving t(
nm a reward suitable to the importance of the dif
:overy. and, in the opinion of government, ade.
juate to his expences, and the time he has devo
:sd to the bringing it into eft'ed.
In order to al'certain the merit of the petition
er's discovery, it becomes necefl'ary to examine
:he advances a-ready made in the art of convert
ng fait-water into frem.
Lord Bacon* to whom the world is indebted so;
he firft germs of so many branches us science, hat
>bferved, that, with a heat lufficient for diitilia
ion* fait will not rife in vapour, and that fair
vater distilled, is ftefli. And it would seem thai
ill mankind might have observed, that the eartl
s supplied with frefh-water chiefly by exhalation
r rom the sea, which is in fact an inienlibie aiftil
ation effected by the heat of the fun. Yet this,
:hough the moil obvious, was not the firft idea ir
be eflays for converting salt-water into freih. FiL
:ration was tried in vain, and congelation coulc
>e related tQ only in the coldest regions am
-afons. in all the earlier trials by diftilJation
"ome mixture was thought necetfary to aid thi
>peration by a partial precipitation of the fait
ind other foreign matters contained in sea-water
3f this kind were the methods of Sir Richar<
Hawkins, in the 16th century, of Glauber, Hau
on and Lifter, in the 17th, ana of Haies, Ap
>leby, Butler, Chapman, Hoffman and Dove, ix
;hc iSth : nor was there any thing in these me
hods worthy noting on the present occasion, ex
ept the very simple still contrived extempore b
Dapt. Chapman, and made from such material
is are to be found on board every ihip, great 0
"mall. This was a common pot with a woodej
id of the usual form, in the centcr of which
was bored to receive perpendicularly a fhor
vooden tube, made with an inch and half auger
vhich perpendicular tube received at it's top, an<
it an acute angle, another tube of wood aifo
vhich descended till it joined a third, of pewter
nadeby rolling up a difh,and palling it obliquel
hrough a caflc of cold water. With this fimpl
nachme he obtained two quarts of frefh-water ai
iour, and observed, that the of fuel vvouli
it. Ver\ trifling, if the still was contrived to flam
)n the tire along with the fbip's boiler.
In 1762, Dr. Lind propoiing to make expeji
ilents of several diltertnt mixtures,* firft diftillei
ain-water, which he supposed would be the purelV
ijid then sea-water, without any mixture, whicl
le expelled would be the least pure, in order t<
irrange between these two supposed extremes th
of merit of the fevera! ingredients he mean
0 trv. Ie To his great surprise," as he confefies
he sea -water wjthouc any mixture, wa
is pure as the rain-water. He pursued the dil
:overy and eftabiiflied the fad, that a pure am
rotable freih-water ma) be obtained from falt-wa
:er by iimplc diftiliation without the aid of an
for fining or precipitating it's foreigi
contents. In 1767, he proposed an extempore ilill
vhich, in fa&, was Chapman's, only lubftitutin
1 gun-barrel instead of Chapman's pewter tube
ind the hand-pump of the fiiip to be cut in tw
>bliquely, and joined at an acute angl.'j
mread of Chapman's wooden tubes bored ex
)refs>, or, imHad of th* wooden lid up,,gh
:Ã¼be, he propoiea a tea-kettie (without i; i lii
:>t handle.) to be turned bottom upwards ove, th
iouth of the pot, by way of ftill-hea?, and
Â»:Ã¼be heading from the spout to a ;un

liomb-iy and Bengal, with a han<* pump,

10 quarts of frefh water in 3 hours.
In 1771* Dr. l-Â«Un, putting together Lind *
idea of diftillin# wwiLhovt a mixture, Chapman i
ftifTj and Dt. Frinxl'n'S method of cooling by
evaporation, obtained a premium of 50001. from
the Britiih paii'arnenc, He wet his tube con
.'luntly with a mop infteadof palling, it through 4
calk of >/3ter ; He enlarged its bore alio in order
to jjive a freer parage to the vapour, and thereby
encreale its quantit) by leltening the refinance o:
prefiure on the evaporating furface: this la'*
Improvement v/aÂ« his own 1 and it donbtlefvcontri
buted to the Â»uccefs of his models 5 and we may
fuppofc the enlargement of the tube ro be ufefui to
that point at which the central parts of the vapour,
pafiing through it, would begin to escape conden
sation' Lord Mulgrave uied his method in his
voyage towards the North Pole in 1773, making
from 34 to qfr gallons of freihwater a day, without
any great addition of fuel, as he lays,
M. de Bougainville in his voyage round the
world, uled, very fuccefafully, a ftiil which he 1
beeii contrived in 1763, by Poyffonier, lo as to
guard against the W3ter being thrown over from
the boiler irjto the pipe by the agitation of tl.a
Ih p- In this.one singularity was, that the fur
nace or fire box was in the midale of the boiler,
so that the wafer Surrounded'it in Con'tafr. Tim
still, however, was expensive and occupied nuuh
room.
Such were the advances already made in the art
of obtaining frefti from fait water, when Mr.
Ifaacks, the pdtitionT, fuggerted his diScovery.
As the merit of this could be ascertained by
experiment only, the Secretary of State asked the
favor of Mr. Rittenhoufe, President of the Ame
rican Philosophical Society, of Dt. Wiftar, pro
feflbr of chemistry in the college of Philadelphia,,
and Dr. Hutchinfon, profelfor of chemistry in
the university of Pen jfylvania, to be prefer Cat
the experiments. Mr. Ifaacks 6xed the pot cf a
small caboufe, with a tin cap and strait tube of
tin pasting obliquely through a calk of cold water 5
he made use of a mixture, the compohtioa of
which he did not explain, and from 24 pints of
Tea water, taken up about 3 miles our of the
Capes of Delaware at flood tide, he distilled 22
pints of freih water, in 4 hours, with 2olb. of
seasoned pine, which was a little wetted by hav
ing lain in the rain.
In a 2d experiment of the 21ft of March, per
formed in a furnace and five gallon ftiil at thÂ«
college, from 32 pints of sea water he drew 31
pints of fre/h water in 7 h. 24 min. with slib.5 lib.
of hickory which had been cut about fix months.
in Order to decide whether Mr. Ifaacks's mixture
contributed in any and what degree to the success
of the operation, it was thought proper to repeat
his dxperirrTfcnc under the fame circumstances
exactly, except the omifiion of the mixture. Ac
cordingly on the next day the fame quantity ot* sea
water was put into the fame still, the lame furnace
was used, and fuel from the lame pa.cel. It yield
ed, as his had done, 31 pints.of freih water in n
min. more of time and with lolb less of wood.
On the 24th of March Mr. Ifaacks performed
a3d experiment. For this, a common iron pot

flue from the hearth wound once round the poc
fpiially, and then parted off up a chimney. ThÂ«
can was of tin, and a strait tin tube of about two
inches diameter, passing obliquely through a bar
rel of water, Served infteard of a worm. From 16
pints of Cca water he drew off 15 pints of frefli
wafer in 2 h. 55 min. with 31b. of dry hickory and
Sib. of seasoned pine. This experiment was also
repeated the next day, with the fame apparatus
and fuel from the lame parcel, but without the
mixture. Sixteen pints, of sea water yielded in
like manner 15 pints of freih, in 1 min. more of
time and with naif a pound less of wootl* On the
whole, it was evident that Mr. Ifaaeks'a mixrure
produced no advantage, either in the procels or
result of the distillation.
Theaiftilled water in ail these instances was
found on experiment to be as pure as the best
pump water of the city. Its taste indeed was not
as agreeable, but it was not such as ro produce
any oifguft. In fa&, we dr-inJc in common life,
in many places, and under many circumstances,
md almoit always at sea, a worse tasted, and pru
sably a less wholeiome water.
The obtaining frelh from saltwater, forages was
onfidered as an important desideratum for the us&
if navigators. The procels for doing this by
iraple distillation is so efficacious, the ere#ing an
xtempore ftiil with luch utenltTs as are found on
voard of every lhip is lo practicable, as to autho
ize the aflertion, that this desideratum is fatisfied.

Mourn her Adonis in a sea of tears ;
Drown'd in a pool, and scarce a fathom deep,

Far on the Atlantic main, where billows rife,
And stormy gales the foundering vefiel chaCe,

Bur, to be droWn'd where only cat-fiih play,
Or llippery eels purfufe their grovelling way,
Where ihepherd Damon scours his lousy goats,
And truant school-boys fail their baby-boats.â

FRANKFORT, August 9.
A Papnphlet in the German language is circu
lated through the empire, and read with avidity
entitled,
A CRUSADE AGAINST THE FRANKS }
Or, a Patriotic Speech to be delivered in th
German Diet, Germany) the second year 0
Liberty.
The following Is an Extract .
" Is it true, Princes/ that the thirst of Frencl
Mood inJuces you to extinguiih the flames of wa
in the eflftj ih order to light them up in the wrj
of Europe. In what refpeft have the French pa
tion offended you ?
" The French have ceased to think that vir
tues, taJents and knowledge, descend from fire ti
iop, Jike robes of ceremony. With them the me
(it oi' ancestors is no avail to cover prejudices, vi
ces, and infignificance : the nobility of head am
heart has destroyed that of birth.
" The French have ceased to think that it wa
neceflary, in order to please God, to support, at ;
great expence, arid in luxury, lazv drones of all co
lours to make long prayers. They have brough
back the monk? and priests, and the bi/hops 1
the primitive purity, and limplicity of christianity
"â¢The French have thought that it was bette
to put a flop to disputes by reconciliation, thai
to foment division by endless litigations betwee,
citizens : they have established judges of peace.
u Without the revolution France must hav
been a bankrupt j and thousands, too credulous
reduced to beggary. The French are now just t
their engagementsâthey pay their debts.
" Whilst despotism occupied the throne c
France, all who were contiguous to that power ha
reason to dread its neignborhood. An eternj
peace is now a fundamental law of that powerft
empire.
" Princes, from wha-t treaty do you derive
ightof difturbirig France. She guarantied indee
he German constitution by the peace of Wefl
shalia j but the despotism of the kings of Franc
â¢vas never guarantied. Why would you draw th
sword f Ii it for Louis XYI ? He does not de
mand your afliftance. He has himfelf sworn Â£h
French constitution, and declared himfelf, in th
fyesof the nation and of Europe, your friend am
aroteCtor.
" The nation ftiJl less has called for you ; an<
tnougfe you had the absurd right of interfering ij
i:s internal afiairs, you have not that of attempt
mg to convert it at the expence of our money
and of our blood, If their constitution is good
t will fubhft in ipite of youâin fpitc of us. i
it is defective, time and experience will produo
.he neceilary reforms. Twice in one centup
iwed' n has changed its constitution j this chang<
has not cost its neighbors one drop of blood.
" What difference does it make to the neigh
bors of France, whether it has one legillator, 01
CWfhve hundred 5 whether the nation i* governe<
by miflieffes, by mini Iters and the r creatures, o
t>v the deputies of the people j whether the Gal
lic prielis are tat or lean ? Will the German com
merce be injured if the prince of Conde is callec
limply M. Conde ?
4t But, exciaim the French ariftocrates, our
aufc is the common cause of kings This terri
ble revolution is an eledlric (hock, which will pui
-â¢very thing in motion. The example of tht
French will not want imitators. Other nations
will learn from them to tread under foot royaJ
rnajefty. The herel'y of the French, like their
Millions and caprices, will infect all Europe.
" Fhus Ipeak thofepretended friends of kings:
but what they in reality regret âwhat they wi/h to
restore, is not so much the interest of royalty as
:hat of ariltocracy ; it is not the king whom they
tfifh to re-eltablifli j it is their their
rrofles,. their ribbons, their titles. They regret
hat they are no longer viziers at the court, Pachas
n the provinces, farmery general, in order to de.
/our the treasury j parliaments, in order to eredt
hemfelves into the preceptors of kings, ana
iroudly engross the title of fathers of thtir coun
ty i prelates, in order to lvvim in opulence, and
nuulge in vice, See. &c. all regret that they are no
onger able to gratify their private resentments
vith leitres de cachet, thar rhey ave no longer
Â»b;e to fatten on the substance oi the state? whilst
niJliona ol families are left to oppreliion ana ncg
jary.
" Germans ! iar from the Frencn ;e
---i'oiutionj you ought to thank heayeti for having
>roductd It.
" When France was uridzr the ycke of an ab
iolute prince, what did you not suiTer ! which ol
ais neighbours did not experience the etlc&s of his
ury and ambition ? Since Charles Viii. Italy,
&pain, Germany, and the low countries, have in
urn been ravaged by French despotism. Did not
Lewis XIV. cover the Palatinate with ruins and
i fnes i who brought Holland to the brink of mi 1 ,
"ho filled Spain ana Italy with coniternacion. aou
kho would have made Germany a province of
France, if the viftr.ry of Hockfted had rot fto-t ;hi
:areer 01 his conquers ? Such was the condudt 01
a despot. Such iti 11 would be his condu&, if he
rould at his pleasure dispose of the population and
mduftry of the French nation. Sucii is the con
dud to which the revolution has now for ever cf
leciuaily put a ltop. A hundred years since wc
inourd have celebrated such a revolurion by bon
fires and solemn thanks to the Almighty j hov;
(hould we have exalted Pvlirabeau and his col
leagues, as ;ingelb deicended from heaven to the
luccour of humanity :âand now, Germans, woui
you again put into the hands of a deJpotio povier
tul, the ftvoid stained with the blood of jour fatheji
and your brothers, and point it Â«ncw againit youi
chHfireft â¦ and all thisyoU Would do, nor for Lew
is XVI. who doe; not demand it, but in order to
plesle lome arifiocrates, who regard as nothing the
tepofe of neighbouring state:, and the haptonel
of their fellow-citizens.

peace with her on the tetms (he has dittated, for
that really no better conditions could be obtained.
They will, no doubt, utge as a proof how highly
we value an alliance with the riefcendanti of the
Prophet, our having spent a million of money-
It would be very provoking; if this unchristian
people applied the old adage to usâ" Fools and
their money, &c."
I am told we are not to have any additions)
taxes :âBut do you think, Mr. Editor, that if
atir great calculator, the Premier, could hit upon
another, what he calls productive, efficient 01-jeifl
jf taxation, his fingers would not itch ? When
be produced his budget to pay off the Spa/iifh ar.
mament, we were told the expences would be liqui
fated by the additional taxes within four years j and
I remember verv well, he previouflv told us there
vas a furblus of revenne, teyond paying the annii
il million of the national debt :âWhat then did
le mean by an additional permanent tax on bills

hey can well bear to lupoly him and his friendj

imagine our Minlfters to be so highly gifted, that
hey forefaw they should have occasion for an odd
million for a flourifh this year at Portsmouth and
Plymouth, or for another next spring, and so on,
id libitum, to maintain the dignity of Great Bri.
.ain at h ime and abroad. Jn my opinion, the
public will begin to have a little forefight, as well
as Minifleis. i fear the former will be too late
:onvinced of their Credulity, and the latter of hav.

The National AlTembly of France havepafled a
iecree prohibiting all clauses in wills, (commonly
heeffefl of parentile caprice,) by which fathers
iifinherit the children, if they marry fucli and fach
3erfons.-âThis is one of the ideas of the late cele
brated Mirabeau, who abfoliit'ely denied that, up
m the principles of nature and reason, a dead man
:ould have any wi.'l. A dÂ«ao man ( said he) is a
ion-entity, and the moment the breath leaves the
>ody it is absurd that Irs will ihould be any Jongef
n force, so as to bind the living, where the prin

Jequefts are not conformable to the laws of nature,
â qual heirfliip, and the laws of a well regulated
