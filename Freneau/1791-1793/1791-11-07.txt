SOME PARTICULARS
relative to the
â¢ OlLj SITUATION, PRODUCTIONS, t-Ji
OF
KENTUCKY;
Extruded from the Manuscript Journal of a Gen
dentin not lortgfmce returned ftWi tkoje parts.
THE fiver Ohio is, beyond all com
petition, the moil beautiful in th<
Universe, whether we consider it so
it's meandering course, through an im
nlenfe region of forefts, for its clean ant
elegant banks, which afford innumer.i
ble delightful fituatioiis for cities, vil
and improved farms, or for thou
many other advantages, which trul\ en
title it to the name originally given i:
by the French of La Edit Riviere. Af
ter passing a distance of five hundred
miles upon those waters, I arrived at
Limestone, which is the general landing
place for people coming by water from
the United States. The defcriptiom
hitherto given of Kentuckey have gen
erally been thought extravagant ; but as
nobody has come forward in contradic
tion to the common reports, v/e natur
ally conclude a country must be very
extraordinary, which every body unites
in extolling.
Influenced by this idea, I approached
this earthly elylium, (as I supposed it)
upon which Nature has been thought to
bestow her inofl peculiar favors, and
the seasons have been laid to Imile with
out interruption. The fir ft appearance
of Limestone, however, will be found
diflatisfa&ory to everyone that lands
from up the River. A number of houl
es situated on a loftv and uneven bank,
apparently at the foot of a very high
lull, (which, on account of a bend in
the river is not seen till you come with
in two miles of it) gives the stranger
notice of his approach to Limestone.
As you arrive you are mortified at find
ing the creek on which the town (lands
(so very conspicuous in the fmallell
maps) nothing better than a mere gut,
which may nearly be leaped over. In
this harbour are seen a few Kentuckey
boats, generally laying near the mouth,
many of which have been broken up to
form those draggling houses which are
perceived on the bankâThe people ot
this place never fail to inform you that
this is the fag end of Kentuckey, and as
you are willing to consider it such with
them, for want of comfortable accom
modation, you are glad to get away from
it as fact as polfible. ,
However, as the quality or the (and
is the oreat object to emigrants, every
one must be pleased with the foil, and
was that the only thing requrfite to
make a country valuable or pleating,
Kentuckey would be the moll so ini tne
world, as the land is no where excelled.
After you are got fairly into Kentuc
key the foil assumes a black appe;arance
rich and light in substance, and (hould
vou visit the country in the spring, you
will be surprised at finding no leaves un
der the trees. The reason is,the ground
is so rich and damp, that they always 10
and disappear with the winter, except
where the foil is evidently poor, foi
that country. It then bears tne appear
ance of the better fort of land m 1 enn
fylvania and jersey, tho' differing wide
ly in fuMance, there being no land tc

There is a fpeciesof flat, orfplit LiTir:-
stone that pervades all the country, a\
ins at unequal depths. In tne ric 1 an
black-looking loil, it lays near theTur
face, and in general the nearer the ftonc
lays to the furface the richer the iand i.
found to be. At the fame time the (torn

Among the many accounts that ha\"
been given of Kentuckey, none of then
have done justice to the timber. OaV
and locust on the flat lands are commoi
at five feet diameter. Poplars growin;
on the beach lands arefo common at fiv<
and fix feet through, as hardly to be no

of pasture in the woods, conftitutc tht
great excellence of Kentuckey ; the dif
advantages will, I fear; nearly counter
balance the luxuriance of the foil.

t rae. You frequently find beds of cfo
Ver to the horle's knees, sometimes !
species of rush-grass commonly callee
wild rye, from "the fimilanty of it's
stalk to the rye so called among us ; m
other places we meet with large tract:
of wild cane, very much eftsemed by
the wild and tame cattle, it continuing
in verdure all the winter. I here is
also a lpecies ofvinecalled the pea vine,
from its producing a small pod, resem
bling that of the garden pea, of which
both horses and cattle are extremely
fond. These are scattered generally
through the country, according to the
different foils, but are not to be met with
universally. The woods, however, as-
Ford abundance of food tor cattle, and
:n consequence of this abundance the
seople pay very little attention to mak
nf and improving pasture lands. -
nilk from this food is thin, and botn
hat and the butter retain a strong take
>!' weeds. In hot weather their milk
vill turn four in two or three hours af
er milking; but, as the custom of the
rountry is to eat four milk, this dilad
,'antage is not much regretted.
It is generally the practice with the
ventuckians to turn out their horses
vith the cattle, and a man is frequently
wo or three days hunting for a hone ne
wants only for half an hour I hen
rattle have been, and are of ncccfiity ex
)ofecl during the winter to subsist in the
,voods, but theconleq.ucr.ce is, thatma
iy of them die, and all luffer extremely;
he common opinion being not we:l
ounded, that the climate is more favor
ible than in the middle States, w.ncn
s fufficiently evident from the winters
icre frequently proving as cold as m
r'ennfylvania or Jersey : with tnis uir
crence, that the changes are more: luu
ien, and the effects more severely telt.
The houses in Kentuckey, iomc tew
n the towns excepted, arc fcarcelycie
erving of the name; which we fhal
nave the less room to admire at, wher
we recollect the short interval ti-.at ha:

A temporary hut is at firft erected,
.eaftasopen as a New-Lngland coin

are seen Ladies neatly dressed, who arc
is yet, obliged to relide (herein for wan
:,{â  better houses. The Taverns arc gen

charged extravagantly for the w-'.r!

who could cat neithtr milk nor bacon

The great boast of a K,enluckcy-maii
â¢, the quantity of corn that the land wil!
rulfe upon an acre ; of which, one hun
dred and seven bufnels is the greatefl
quantity that I could find afcertamed to
have been produced. This, in the fall,
fells for fix pence a buOiel. Ihe com
mon produce of the foil is from fifty to
eighty bufnels an acre, in a favorable
season. This upon an average, is about
three times the quantity we can raise 011
ar. acre :n the old slates ; gram of this
kind mull therefore always be low in
Kentuckey, probably lower than at
prelent, when the country comes to be
more opened.
Hitherto there has not been much
nore grain ruifcdthan has Deenconfum
:d by the inhabitants ; and the persons
;migrating there, together with the trade
'own the river, may afford ,1 tine prof
>e& in theory, to but will
lever turn out of any lolid advantage to
he public of this fettlemcnt : The dif
iculty in returning up the river mull
emier the voyage terrible. To make
lead a gain ft the It ream muft'oedone by
lint of severe labor and mam strength,
rnd would require exertions which no
nan would eve!r wish to make a second
ime, who was not urged by the induce
nent of gaming a speedy fortune
hereby.
In palling through the country dur
ni the fummel- season your attention is
lways drawn to the drynefs of the
reeks and runs. A little water is infome
ilaces, seen standing among the flat
tones, but so warm with the iun that
attle will scarcely drink it. We feel
iuA at the fight of a large and beautiful
ountry, that will forever labour under
he inconvenience of a want offerings
nd running water, at lead, five months
n the year. The lightness of the foil,
n wet weather, soon makes' the roads
inpleafant for travelling, which arc as
oon dried again in fair weather. Ihe
am finks presently below the furface,
he brooks which were just now flow
ig with water, are in a few hours dry,
nd seized as it were with a general
hirst.
At present horse mills grind a great
art of the corn and wheal of the coun
ry, altho' a comparatively imall part
f the latter is used by the inhabitants,
rho generally give the preference to
ndian meal baked in a pot, or before
ic fire.
All strangers, upon their arrival here,
mdergo a purgation, which is thought
a proceed from the limestone quality
mparted to the vi ater from the nature
,{ the foil. Gnats and flies are very
roublelome, particularly in the fall, at
vhich season they become a perfect tor
ncnt both to man and bead.
Log houses mult be expc&ed to be

~e r y scarce article for want of saw mills;

.uckey might well exclaim in the lan
guage of V irgil,
Qua regio in tcrris nojlri non plena labcrris
For of law there is enough, claims for
land interfering continually, and light:
so laid one upon another, that scarcely
any body knows who is fafe. Ihe em
igration tothispart of the continent has
been amazing, and this is the best placc
in the world for people to remove U

It will require a long time to introduce
luxuries into the region called Keutuc
key, in any great plenty. But if the Em
igrant should be an enthusiast (as many
are who comc to fettle here) and looks
forward to the complete settlement of
this territory, he will think it the land
jf promise. and point it out to his chil
dren to be the spot for the millenium of
the world, where the farce of titular
dignity and the parade of courts fhali
lever be exhibited ; where monarchy
[hall never intrude to trample upon the
rights of man ; but a pure and equal re
jublican form of government fhail gra
dually introduce the practice of those
virtues, which are consonant to the true
rature of our i'pecies.
The Buffaloes have entirely quitted
he cultivated parts of Kentuckey, and
he Deer have become scarce ; of wild
urkies however, there are an abundance
learly as tame as those bred in the yard.
â¢Yom their being extremely poor in the
ummer they remain unmolel.ed : in the
virtter they grow very fat, and are rec
koned delicious food: of other birds
here is no great variety.
No land appears better adapted to t" '
rulture of tobacco than that of Ken'
tey, and it is now become one of ' "
taples. At present there are bi'
>rchards, but as the country ope

ault of the mills, or it may pro<
iom the richness of the ground, tho' ,
nuft be confeffed the grain itielf looks
/veil. As to money, it is scarcely a me
lium ofcommerccj except with fliopand
a vein keepers. Every thing has two
inccs, the trade and cajh price. What
alh there is, soon becomes collected in
hefhops,andreturns for goods; imports
elling from one to two hundred per
â ent more than the Philadelphia price ;
lotwithllanding which, every one dref
es gay, and except about the houses,
/on find the appearance of industry and
deanlinefs. The general mode of fct
ling, with a new Emigrant, is to build
i little log hutâ-he then lets about gird
ing, or killing the trees, and wjren that
s done, puYs in his corn without delay,
should he, after all this, not feel at home,
ior relish his situation, or admire his
:>rofpeÂ£ts, his only consolation will be
if it can be called a consolation) that.
o the family of a poor man, women and
hildren, it is a dreadful, I may fay, almojt
in impossible thing to return.

CONSTANTINOPLE, July 24.
Intelligence of a very difagreeablc
nature is received from Mecca, the
cor.sequences of which will in all pro
bability prove fatal to the Ottoman
power in Aha ; an Arabian tribe, con
lifting of near fifty thousand men have
polfelied themselves of Mecca, pillaged
the treasures, and deposed the Sheriff,
whose place is filled by one of his
Chiefs. The caravan which travels
every year to this city, carrying with it
a vail number of pilgrims of the Mus
sulman faith, has (topped in Syria, not
daring to pursue their journey any far
ther. This event has occasioned many
conferences in the Divan, but any de
cilivc step is deferred till further par
ticulars are received.
II A C U E, August 17.
The Princcfs of Orange is preparing
to set out on a journey to Brunlwick
and Berlin, with a view to encourage
the enemies of the French revolution,
and engage them, if poflible, to fall up
on Alsace and Lorraine. As a prepa
ratory step they have inserted in the
public prints the articles of the treaty
of Westphalia, which are there pre
tended to have been infringed by the
Decrees of the National Assembly. Se
cret advice has likewise been sent to
France from thisquarter, imploring the
King not to accept thenewconftitution,
or at least to delay the acceptance of it
as long as possible, with a promise of
speedy relief from hisprefent disagreea
ble fituatian ; to effect this purpose no
money will be spared ; but as to the
Prince of Orange himfelf, he is quite
phlegmatic on the occaiion, anddoes not
seem to espouse the cause of the arifto
cratical party, with that warmth they
expected. Some of these poor gentle
men waited on him the other day, on
purpose to pay their court he received
them with a deal of ceremony, and, in a
very formal manner, addressed them as
follows : â" I am truly grieved, gentle
men, for your unfortunate situation, ant
profpecls ; I, too, in my time have had fac
tions, perplexities, and popular injuflice ti
contend with, but I defy the world to Jaj
the fault was mine." With these word:
he wished them well, and left them, un
der pretence of more urgent buiinefs.

The Sultan of the Turks is so il
pleased with the conditions of peace
offered by the Emprefs,that he has now
for a l'econd time applied to the cour
ef Spain, that by their means and in
. terference, he may obtain better terms
The discontents of hisownfubjefts will
however, compel him to accede to the
peace that is offered. News is just re
ceived here that the confcquenccsof the
battle of Maczin were much more fata
than the defeat itfelf. Afterthe Granc
Vizir had retreated to Hetfova, ant
from thence to Schiumla, he was vcrj
near being cut to pieces by his owi
troops, and only made his escape by <
very precipitate flight. The whol<
Turkish army was dispersed, and in thi
greatest eonfufion, the Arnautes havin:
fallen upon the Jariifarics and put ,
greater number to the sword than ha<
fallen in the battle.
AIX-la-CHAPELLE, Aug. 20.
The continual going and coming-os
couriers has given rife to a suspicion
that certain sovereigns have femething
el's in view, than merely making apeace
for the Turks, lince that m ly he consi
dered as good as accomplished. The
French exiles are penuading themselves
that Francs is the principal objett of all
these movements, and that the relpec
tive sovereigns have it much at heart to
reinstate Louis XVlth in all his prero
gatives, to restore the French Nobleflo
to all their privileges, and the clergy to

guard, and taken to prison. Next day
the citizens rose, broke open the prison,
and carried him in triumph to all the
public places in the city, making him
ling <;a ira to his heart's content, in spite
of the garrison. The intendant, how
ever, and the arillocrats of the town
kept themselves carefully concealed all
tins time, till a large body of troops
which they had sent for, came in fight.
Unfortunately the citizens, to the num

The propolitions, after some debate, were
adopted.
After some debate, relative to inserting in the
confutation, the right of granting pardons, as the
king's prerogative, it was moved by M. Lingui
nais, as follows:
" The National Aflembly declares, that the
conflitution is formed, and that it cannot be
changed."
Tne inolion was put and carried unammoufly.
Not one member role in ojjpofition on the right

from every part of the assembly, teftified the
triumph of patriotilm. The acclamations con

joined 111 equal expressions oi tiiumph. The
one party happy that they touched the end of
the glorious labours which have employed them
lo incefiaiitly, and fubjefcled thetn 10 luch various
calumnies, foreign and domeflic, surrounded as
they wete with dangers, alarms, and calamities
ot every kind. The other party, to all thele,
had the additional motive of joy, that thev were
now fafe a o amik further modification, for, irrita

went to the Thuilleries, and took the Kino's

About three quarters after eight the proceifion fat

the Gonftitutional AÂ£t, which confeerates the
imprelcr.pt,ble rights of the French people;
which .egenerates the government, and afcer

The King read his anlwer from a paper

the number ought to be so considerable
as to embrace the opinions and secure
the confidence of the people at large.

THIS Indian weed that once did grow
On fair Virginia's fertile plain
Fiovn whence it came, again may go
To pleal'e forne happier swain :
Of all the plants that Nature yield?,
This, lead belov'd, ftiall shun my helds.
In evil hour 1 firft elfay'd
To chew this vile, forbidden leaf
When half afham'd, and half afraid,
I touch'd and tailed to iny grief:
Ah me ! the more I was forbid
1 The more I wifh'd to take a quid.
But when I fmoak'd, in thought profound,
And rare'd the fpiralcircle hi^h,
My heart grew lick, my head turn'd roundâ
And what can all this mean ?âfaid Iâ
Tobacco, surely, wasdt fign'd
To poison and deflrov mankind !
Unhappy they, whdm choice, or fate
Inclines to prize this bitter weed !
Perpetual source of female hate â
On which no be all, but man, will feed â
That chills my heart, and turns my head
And fends me reeling homeâto bed.

LOG TOWN TAVERN.
The following was composed fame yean ago at t
Jma.ll Inn, filuated in a remote and defa>
part of Carolina. A very incorreEl copy hav
ing appeared in a" Northern Newfpaber, th
subsequent Stanzas are now pubUjjicd as writ
ten by the Author.']
rHROUGH sandy waftesand floods of rail
To this dtje&ed placf 1 came,
Where fwarihy.nymphs in tatter'd gowns
From pine-knots light their evening flame.
Where barren oaks in close array,
With mournful melody, condole,
Where no gay fabric meets the eye,
Nor painted board, nor barbers pole.
Thou town of Logs ! âfo juttly call'd
In ttee who hal'.s at evening's close
Not dreams from Jove, but hotts of fleas
Slnll join, to sweeten his repose.
Since here I pae'd on weary steed,
Ah ! blame rne not, should I repine
That sprightly girl, nor social bed,
Nor jovial glass, this night is mine.
The Landlord, goug'd in either eye
Here drains his bottle to the dregs,
Or borrows Susan's pipe, while (lie
Prepares the bacon, and the eggs.
JAMAICA, that mfpires the foul
In these abodes no time has seen
To dart its genial influence round,
To kindle wit, and kill the spleen.
The squire of this disheartening inn
AtFords to none the generous bowl,
Displays no BACCHUS on the sign,
To warm the heart and cheer the foul.
To cider drawn from tilted cask
While some their fond attention paid,
He griev'd to fee the empty fla{k,
Its iubftance gone, it's strength decay'd.
A wandering hag, in dismal notes
Screech'd out a iong, to ease my grief;
Two boors their dull adventures told,
A shepherd each, and each a thief.
Dame judice here in rigour reigns,
All have on all the griping paw ;
Whoe'er with them a bargain makes,
Scheme as he will, it ends in law.
With scraps of songs and smutty words,
Each lodger here adorns the wallsâ
The wanton muse no pencil gives,
The coal her mean idea scrawls.
In murmuring dreams no chryflal wave
To cheer I he wretched hamlet flows,
But frowning to the distant bog
Susanna, with the pitcher, goes.
At dusk of eve, the tardy treat
Was plac'd on ol knotty pine ;
Each gaping, gax'd to fee me eat,
While round me lay the fnonng swine.
Unblefl be Ihe, whose heavy hand
Before me plac'd that mouldy pent ; *
May Ihe ne'er meet the joyous kiss,
Condemn'd to fret and ileep alone.â
1 he horfc, that bore me on my vvav
Around him call a rueful eye,
He looK'dâand saw no manger near,
And hung his head, and feem'd to sigh.
* A compofitim cj Mian meal r.rd u.-Lcr tak
ed brfore the Jire
At fturr.p of pine, For want of flail,
All night beneath adripping tyee,
Not fed with oats, but fill'd wi'.h wind,
And hulks, and blades, alone flood he,
Difcourag'd at so vile a treat,
Yet pleas'd to fee the early dawn
In hade we left this dismal place
Nor ftay'd to drink their dear YOPPON. J
May never weary pilgrim here,
Unlets for penance he's equipt,
Bo fore'd to pals his tedious night,
Or, doom'd to deep where I have flcpt.
