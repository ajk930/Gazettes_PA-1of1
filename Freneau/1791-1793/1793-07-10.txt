The perilous lituation, however, of our
rieiul and benefactor in the days of atlver

( oilld that heart be of American texture
which did not swell with indignation pud

tlie anniversary of monarchy in the very

they touted the monarch on the Very spot
where bis sword h;,d but recently (l:td a

adoration paid before our faces to that be
nevolent author of the late war, whose
wifli it was to teach his American Juijeiti
the duties of son-refinance by the delibe

oi'i the NCKFOLK Advertiser ~

Btvvai will in a few days open the

Mt'Â» Â« e!l wither to the managers, whoso
attention ; n contributing to the amusement
sf the public, h is always merited the moji
liberal patronage, I (hall trouble )ui wkh
a few remarks.
In every age the flag? has been the school
of instruction, as well as feme of atnuf.'-
ment. At on? time vice and folly are ex
pofetl for the bentfic of moral improve
ment, at another time the heart is fofteiud
and humanized by the representation of
pirtne in diflrefs. Sometimes the ftzre
becomes the fcheol of patrrotjfrii, when;
the virtues of our ancestors are revii...,
and tl;e political creed of a nation is n -
liearled. On thejudprm :it of managers in
felefling proper fui.'jefls for representation,
the appiopciatiou of the public mult ex
pendâ great attention fliould be
nothing which is adverse to the geuins and
government of a free country (liouUl be ex
hibited 'n a meritorious 1 ght: â For exam
ple, the ancient Romans would hav? cOn
ceivcil thf mfelves much irifuUed hadtKv
been colieihd to ha\ e (een the expul/icii
us the Tarquins repreferted as a of
-ompcflion ; nor would the modern French
be flatter, (I in Jiearing the decapitation of
I.oui-, and the ini|-riiohment of Maria
Antoniette, trag (ally lamentfd, and
then selves cal'ed inffisns and murt'erers.
Repi blican Americans would be very iiule
gratiiiec! with the 1- ombaflickl rhapli dies of
loyalty for kin;;s and princes, or their ima
ginary diftrefies; and democratic \ rrv,9
â vould. illy suit a royÂ«i audivuff at l-'ruiy
iane-.It has been said that the managers havejf
determined, if pollible, to give fatisfactio 1 t
to ail parties ; âlt is hoped that we are ,
Kat to be infitlted by feeing a set of itine- ,
rant people, reliding here for the purposes |
of trade, or brought here by accident, ex- 1
alted into the d : giiity of a party. Toufe
an old adageâ" When we are at Rome,
we mult do as thev do in Rome;" and
men of fe'ife will readily acquiesce.
The allies of the French will be as much
tlifgufted to fee a Frenchman reprefenfed
as a monkey, as an Engliilimau would lie
to fee him represented as a rational beingâ
'â¢ Goii save tke ii/ig" will be ;>â¢ unpleasant"
to some as "Cairo" wou!Â«l be to others.
I do not with to regulate the publis talte ;
but I am fafe in faying, that the managers
vught to consult the difpolkion of the au
tlience. I own it is unfortunate for us,
that depending oil thi English dramatic
writers, we are, as Americans and friends
to France, oftencommpelied to hear tilings
xvliich are as inlulting to our own feelings,
as tiley are illiberal towards our frie'-ids ;
âHut a little attention in om tting some,
and qualifying others, would not be unde

In an a Idrefs from the Baltimore Me
ch mic il Satiety, to the PrefWent of the
V lited States, will be found the following
pdlY;e : "But the miferieiof war, we de
pre.at;, a id circHiH tanced as oiu* country

will irquiefce with :he American citizens
in t!ie acicnowled ;em?nt of that political

that the duty and interelt of the United
States require, that we (hould, with lince
rity and good faith, adopt and pursue a"
<>idu:V friendly and impartial towards the
b'lligerent powers." Tha language of
t lis address seems to indicate, after a ten
v y â¢ trs peace, in the course of which our
<oil 11 try has incfeaf din the proportion of
Â©ne third ih population, attd with the ad
dition of its fertility aid other resources, '
mall have doubled its strength, that we
ought notwithitanding. so far to deprecate
the evils of war, as that ill order to avoid
tie n, we (hould tamely fubmil to every
iadignity and infiilt, which the pride and
arrogance of Britain may think proper to
offer.
Is not the erroneous po.ltlon. laid down
in jultiHcation of oir conduit toward
the French, that circumltanced as our
country and government are, it becomes
O'lr duly and interefl to adopt and pursue
with linearity and gooif faith, a cond.icl
friendly and impartial towards the bell -
gereit powers, as strong an invitation to
the British to mfult and invade us aÂ» they
could desire ?
What are those Â«f our
count y and government which lhould in
<l ace us humbly to fiibmit to the imperious
Â«I.elates of a petty tyrant on board of an
armed Sritiffi velfel ? Shall we now tame
ly fulfer the inv-ilion of those rights which
twenty yÂ»ar> ago we so ob.linately and
properly defended ?
Tlie Freuch want no apology from us
for refilling them aili.tanceâperhaps they
â want 110 a!fill3nceâÂ»if they did, they would
3iave to lament that we want fpirlt to re
sent the insults offered to ourselves, and
therefore will h.-.rclly exptfl u., from a
principle of gratitude, or even in compli
ance with a lolemn treaty, to aflift them.
However neceflTiry it may be from duty
and interest for the Americans to adopt
and purlue an iinptrtial conduct towards
the belligerent pouers, I trust it will hard
ly I>e in their dilpo itions to view with sin
cerity of friendihip the conduct of those
powers who have provoked war for'the
purpose of forcing defpoUfm 011 uiankiiid.
EXTRACT.
from the Southern Ce.ntinel, printed at
A igiLjla, in Georgia : June 13.
When the misfortunes of a large and res
pectable community are to be "attributed
ta the conduct of a single indiviÂ«lual, it is
our duty not only to animadvert on his
m" ifures, but to trace the fotirce from
â wtience these misfortunes flow If " a
great m in (truggling in the storms of fate
J- a light 0:1 which the gods might look
down with pleasure ; with what indigna
tion might they not behold that wretch
who, "roni the fordid view of gain, would
furifiet" the lives of his fellow citizens and
open a scene of savage cruelty 1
With a pitient endurance of fhfirering
a?gravated by circumstances the moH in
fulting, Ihe people of Georgia have f.ir a
contiJerabl â¢ time been expefed to the fe
ro. ityof savages without the means of
felf -defe-ce. Or the pouÂ»i- of retaliation
At this ltlpment, when our frontiers are
la.d wade with murder and devaltation â¢
when men, wonen and children, are put
to the mo ft cruel tortures; a law is 111
exiften-e, prohibiting a citizen of the Hate
of Georgia from touching a Creek Indian
on pain of being given up to the mercy oi'
those ravages. This law alio furiiiflies the
Creek* with arms and ammunition to kill
the Georgians, but it makes no previous
for the Georgians to kill the Creeks, in
cafe of an attack. â  If this law is conlillent
with the principles of a free government,
or with civilization, or with any thing
that bears the name of humanity, then are
my arguments without foundation.
The treaty of New-Yoris has been pro- ,
ductive of more ill confequÂ«nces to this
llate, than Britilii devaltation and plunder.
It was not the deliberate and mature act
of a wife legislative body, but the hatty
eSufions of a man who bore no good will
to Georgia.
The next wife meafiire planned and a
dopted in the fam# department, was the
appointment of an agent for Indian affairs;
in which exalted office James Seagrovc,
ESQUIRE, was placed. By wkatinterell
or by what recommendafion, Mr. Sea
grove came to the appointment, is not my
present pnrpofe to inquire into; "What
Ins former merits were I neither know
nor care ; but were we to judge the man
by his conductance a federal officer, we
(hould not be apt to pronounce his princi
ples pure and uncontaminated.
Tuat he commenced Indian trader, as
soon as he was coinmitfioned, is a fait
well afcertaineri 4 That, with a view to
monopolize that trade himfclf, he made
life representations to the exe
cutive department, of the hellile difpoliti
on ol the Indians towards thisftate, carries
with it the air of probability;â That he
lias violatt; 1 the trult reposed in' him. 1
leave his fellow citizens to determine: But
that lÂ»e hasa&ed unworthily of a free citi
zen and a public officer, is-a point I will
maintain.

PHILADELPHIA. j
Wednesday, July 10.
By the arrival of the schooner '
capt. Jones, in 12 days from Cape Fran- ,
cois, we have received the melancholy in
telligence of the burning of thatonce beau
tiful town, by the Mulattoes. Several
palfengers have arrived in the EaÂ£le, who
were glad to save their .Jives and leave all ]
their property to be deilroyed. There
were alio above no fail of merchantmen, (
who were obliged to leave the Cape, under |
convoy of some French Ihlps of war : ma
ny of thole merchant velfelsput to sea with j
Uiort provisions ami without half the quan- .
tVty of â¢Svater necelfary to bring them to
the American ports, although they are in
general lull ol paiiengers who tied from (
the toi flagration. Hundreds were Jh^;t bp
the Mulattoes, on their way as they ran
from their houses towards the boatsâfor
as soon as tlie town was tired in several
places, particularly on t'ne 23d ult. the
white inhabitants ran out into the ftreels
dillracted, and were barbaroully murdered
by the Mu'attoes, without refpeft to fjx,
age,or condition.
It is d.fficult, as yet, to arrange any
thing like s co inetted account of tais
dreadful cata(h"o|)he. Bnt so far as can
be colleiled from the [jafl'engers, and from
<;apt- Jones, it appears, that the whole ori
ginated from some jealotify between gene
rat Galbaud, a id tiie co'irimifiioners San
thonax and Polvcrell, who behaved very ill
to him and the wh.tes, as wed as to the
admiral Â»f the llert.
Some fay th3t Galbaud had entered into
some contrail:; for flour, duringthe abtence
of the commiilioners, while they w ere at
the fourli li<>e of the island. This they
diia.pprovrd of. Others liatc, that
general Galbiud li.id . '.1 eftatein the Spacifli
part of the island, he could not be quali
fied to hold the conmiiffion he has from tie
French Republic. Be this as it may, the
cojnmiluoiiers ordered him to be arreted
and sent back to France. But during tljefe
disputes. which lasted from the 17th tu'the
:4th of June,-other fcc'nes of diflrefs were
fling in every quarterâSeveral fajjor..
vere insulted by the Mulattoes, and cut
with fibres ; complaints were made to
he coivnni(fi.>ners in. vain,, for they were
twtally devoted to the Mulattoes' interest,
a id won.d scarcely hear a word from a
white perfan ; nay, they insulted the 1110 ft
refpeilable merchants tint cjme to them
,*ith complaints againli the Mulattoes ;
this encouraged the latter to the greatefi
<legree of insolence. and they began to f--c

The following is another Jlatemeat' cfthls
intelligence as given by capt. Jonts.
On the 7th of June, as the armed Mulat
tos were going out to lore Picolet, th-y
ueie met by several Tailors, who were in
liquor, and one of them joflleel againltone
ot tile men of colour; he immediately
tlivvv his hanger, and wounded him ; the

and they tlevv. On the iÃtii,a great number
of men of colour came on the king's wharf,
and gave themfome very iufoientlaiignage,
whicit was the cause of a quarrel : me
Mnlauoes being ail aimed, the fiulors had
to fly ; they leizcd one ot ihe marines be
longing to one oi the lhi|is of war, and
made him beg their pardo.j on his knees.
Alter the aaove, leveral of the inhabitants
that wei e ftandiiig at their doors, were
wounded by the Mulattos,âThey went
to enter their complaints, and received 110
fatjslaciion. On cue 19th a proclamation,
was ilfued out by the commifi'aries : on the
-Oth, two hours after the faiiors lanned,
the coinmillariei opened ail the prisons,
and let the Brigr.ncs out, to dell.oy the
town and its inhabitants.

without any fatiUacliou. On the 20th, in

tii it itis impolfible todefcrib? file cfifireffes
of the unli >v inhabitants of the Cape ;
every build, ig of consequence he saw in
fl ines, and the pjtfengers, by him, flew
to prcferve their lives.
Since the foregoing intelligence was
communicated we have heard further ac
counts bv the brig A&ive, capt. Waters,
and several other vessels : â
It is said that the British prifonprs at the
Cape, amongfl whom were the officers and
marines and feainen belonging to the pri
vateer Hvxna. (captured only a few days
before this melancholy event took place)
J>u: themselves under the command of a
British officer, and fought bravely by the
fide of the F'rench soldiery an<l f.iilorj under
" leral Galbuid, againlt the coiiimiifion
rs, mulattoes, and negroe.i. But Gel
band. had he flood out 5 minutes longer,
it is thought must have gained a viÂ£tory ;
he, however withdrew the troops and
"went 011 board the French ships of war, af
ter fighting three days, and with him took
the British officers, &c. who had so cou
rageoufly afiifted him.
Thisis a striking inllance of the uncer
tainty of human events, and the fate of
war âHow remarkable to fee the French
and British soldiers and fajlors, who, but
a few <hys before were employed in the
trade of (laughtering one another, so soon
join hand and fight like brethren against
the nmlattoesand negroes' â
At the fame time that Galbruid quitted
thefceneof attion, it is said the commis
sioners, Santhonax and Polverel, also fled
with the soldiery under their command in
to the country, and thtr- the town of Cape
francuis bei.ig evacuate I by both armies,
was immediately exposed to the depreda
tions of the negroes, mulattoes, and bri
j!;and% who finding nothing! o oppose them,
rulhed in with demoniac fury and set fire
to i; in every quarter. âHad either party,
Calbattd's or the commiflioners succeeded,
this inoft unfortunate event would proba
bly not have happened.
Another American veiTi-1 is taken and
earried into Jamaica, the brig Defiance, of
ii iltirttore- She was I iden with sugar and
coffee, and bsund for Baltimore ; had on
board 30 negroes a id 8000 dollars in spe
cie. The i.nglifh privateers are very
troublesome to American vefiels among
the windward islands: several have been
very latelytaken and carried into St. Kitts.
Â»pd every ungenerous pretence made-use
of to hive the cargoes condemned.
Liters from England mention, that pro
duce of every fort there has aftonilhingly
declined in value. Jamaica, or St Do
mingo cotton will not bring more than from
ii to 13 pence prr lb", and impossible to
jijnke sales of that or almost any imported
article, there being no demand and the
Itocjc on hand very great ; added to which
the whole manufacturing buiiuefs of the
country is at a tiand.
On Sunday la'l arrived here a large brig,
call el the Mary, from J.imiica, taken
off the Delaware Capes by the frigate Am
bufcadc. Her cargo confilts of Wed-India
produce. The privateer Citizen Genet,
tias sent a prize into Baltimore, taken
about 10 leagues from the Capes of Chesa
peake ; also uSpanifh brig, prize to another
French privateer, has arrived at Norfolk.
She had an action with the privateer, in
â¢which 4 of her seamen were killed and j
jumped overboard.

" You will judge, my dear friend, to
what height public spirit has risen in this
city. About 2000 yonng people of 14 or j 5
years of age but who have not compleated
their j6th year, and therefore not liable to
enter into the national gu,i. d came out of
what is called the battallion of childien,

to prefest 011 their knees a petition to go
to the frontiers at the expence of their fa
milies, f,vearing at the lame time they
wquld not rife until they fhonld do juflice
to their demand. The members of the
convention could not refrain from tears, at
the interesting light of youth so cournge
oully offering itfelf. They rushed for
ward to embrace these generous children,
who, without changing attitude, inrreated
the legifl'ature immediately to pronounce
their concurrence, but feeing the afllmhly
undetermined, the lead, r and orator of
this affeiting deputation, turning hijnfelf
towards his brethren, addrefied them in
the words following, which were fre
quently interrupted by his tears.
" My companions let us go, and return
didtbnoured to our families, for the fa
thers of oar country judge us incapable of
dying for lire republic." A niajeitic calm
fueceeded all at once to this public fcene
and the convention, after a lhort debate,
decreed in the greatest silence that the le
gion, called the children of the republic,
fhottid hot J itfelf in readiness to depart in
8 days for the frontiers. Instantly shouts
of long ti-ee the republic were heard from
every corner of the hall, and more than
20,000 voices replied from without. I wa?
there, my dear friend, and 1 cannot recall
the ravilhing light, without shedding tears
of joy. The mothers of these inconceiv
able children attended Them at the paflage,
and, weeping, congratulated them oil hav
ing deserved the confidence of the rcpnb

orders that this legion be condu&ed by
short marches to the frontiers, and that
the national volunteers of Paris should go
in two months to relieve from their polts
these young pttpils of the country,little ac
customed to the fatigues of a camp. What
an example for every town through which
they will pass, and what e ithutiafm they

" Many of your people will wonder at
the difiolution of the family conduct, the
ties of religion that formerly held Spair
and France together, and our new jurfti
on with a power with which we have for
centuries hcen on bad terms. The mat
ter will he plain when it is said, that If.
France becoming a free and republican
nation, Spain evidently fee; the emancipa
tion and independence of all her vast pof
feflions in America. Theeventis dread

are convinced that it is not remote. Your
Miflifliippi will then be free, and your flag
appear in ports of your adjoining conti

will ever be inaccefiible. One thing is really
wonderful that England hss so far over
feeir her interest as not to unite \yith
France in haftcning the freedom of Ame
rica, which would be immensely to her ad

" J failed from Ar.x-Cayes about a fort

for Baltimore, full of freight, when eight
or nine days after leavingAux-Cayes, I tell
in with the schooner May Flower, a priva
teer belonging to this, port, who took me
into possession as having French property
on board, and sent my veiTel and cargo here
for trial. On their tirft taking nJe, they
mentioned that American property was not
to be diflurbed, bnt that all French proper
ty they were determined to have ) and in
consequence of an information lodged by
one James Alpine, who was, or acted us
mailer of a fcHoone* belonging to \ irginia,
they were particularlv informed my vellel
and cargo were both French property ; this,
although an infamous fatlhood. had induced
them to libel both (loop and cargo, and be
ing an entire stranger here, and delVutite of
the money neceff.iry ta secure iureties for
the cost, I am neceflitated to give up my

God knows is just, if 1 had - wherewith to

was present, and nothing can be proved to
ascertain the sale, yet I think, and am
afraid, his chance will be small of recover

Many arguments have been made tife of
to Tefiite those whp havejailerted that A

the nation of France as the object of our
gratitude-for the hlefiings which we now
et)joy from independence, a good govern
ment, and a fertile country, the produce
of which we can spply to our own use.
1 o prove to which of the parties sur obli
gations are really due we will quote what
followsfrom the Annual Register for the
year 1776. page 184, under the head of
The liiftory of Europe "It is probable,
that Europe much indebted for the con
tinuance of its tranquility, to the pacific
disposition of the French monarch, which
is fuppolVfl with difficulty to have retrain
ed the activity or restlessness of a close aily
and powerful neighbour, as well as the
ardour of the princes of the blootj, the
nobility, and the nation in general, who
are thought to be eagerly dil'pofed for a
\yar.
" Indeed from whatever cause it pro
ceeds, the American party is so strong in
France, thai seems nearjy to include the
whole nation, except the ruling part of
crte court. However, that may be, the
prcfent disposition of the courtls favoura
ble to the happiness of mankind, and, in
the present date of affairs, particularly
fortunate to Great Britain."
The applicability of the above passage in
the history of Europe, written and pubiilh
ed by EnglWhmen, is a proof, beyond the

6 eight pounders, about 5 leagues east of
the capes of Virginia. The brig Corn
wallis tlriick, after engaging one hour.
The ship Trusty fought the Citizen Genet
3 hoars* when the ammunition chert on
board the privateer took fire, blew up, and
wounded lix of the crew in a terrible man
ner. In coiifeqnence of this accident (he
bore away for the Chesapeake, without
being in a condition to feture her prize,
who with the ship crowded fail, and llood
away S. S. E.
A venel is just arrived at Norfolk in ten
days from Bollon, spoke a brig from Bri
stol, only 28days out; the captain of which
informed him, that the French had gained
a signal Victory over the combined
armies of Austria, ahd Prnffia. near Dun
kirkâthat they beat and drove them in ail
politions, making gt Â«jt. slaughter, and tak
ing a number of prisoners;
The following accouiit of the diftrefles
at Cape Francois is copied from a New-
York paper of lad Monday.
Capt. Fanning of the brig Union, ar
rived yefterdiv in 14 days from Cape
Francois, gives the following melajicholy
particulars refpefting the fate of that un
happy island.â
" On the > Bth of June, the civil commif
lioncrs, Meli'rs. Santhonax and Polverel,
arrived at the Cape from Port-au-Prince,
âthey immediately fulpended Molls. Gal
beau, thÂ£ governor and commander of the
troops at that place, and Cent him on board
ihip ; on the 19th a number of mulattoes
were encouraged by these gentlemen, to
come into town, who, by unfair means,
armed all the negroes belonging to the
liti-zens, and encouraged them to affilf in
deftro'ying all the whites, which fcer.e
aÂ£talu'v began 011 the 20th about noonv hen
an indiscriminate mr-h'acre of both sexes
took plateâmen, women and children
were cut to pieces, to the number of be
tween 8 and 10 thousand ; numbers took
refuge in the mountains, where it is fup
pefsd they iÂ»ave ihared a firoilar late to
their brethren ere this ; âthofe who were
more fortunate, escaped oil board the (hip
ping with what little cloaths they had on ;
the wretches then began to plunder thÂ»r
town, after which they set fire to it, and
on the 23d, when capt. Fanning failed,
there were not more than johoules {land
ing. Capt. Fanning failed in oompany
with 250 fail of vefiels bound to different
ports in America, umjer-eonvoy of two
74's and five frigates, who were bouftd to
Boflon or Newport,fo that we may hourly
expect to hear of their arrival. On Sa
turday last he fell in With the l'Ambufcade,
otf Barnegat. who detained him for three
hours, and then ordered him to proceed
onâCapt. Fanning's register, and all his
papers were burnt at the Cape.
The merchants of the city of Philadel
phia assembled on Monday last, in conl'e
quence of the departure of the French brig
Litt'le Democrat (late the Little Sarah)
armed& fnppofed to be bound on a cruize.
They appointed a committee to infoitn the
governor, that at lead one of the hands, if
not more, on board said brig is a citizen of
the United States. This committee w,A
also directed to make further enquiries re
lative to the equipment of the brig in this
particular. '1 hey were 10 reporr in the
evening.
On the sd inft. a velTel arrived at Boston
in 15 days from Oftend, which place (he!
left the 15th ot May. The French were
then in high spirits and determined to de
fend their country to the last extremity.
Every neceflary of provifionj, &c. were in
plenty, and no appearance of want
throughout the republic. Accounts were
current in Oftend of an engagement be
tween one of the French armies and the
Britifii and Auftrians combined, in which
the latter were defeated with the loss of
twelve hundred men. A body of 1000
British foices marched from Oft end on the
10th May to join the combined armies;
others had arrived, and more were expec
ted. Gen. Cuitine, at the head of 20,000
men was ready to attack the ele&orate o(
Treves, and his advanced pods were ac
tually on the electoral frontiers.-.
On Monday morning last died, Mr. BeM*
lAMin TowNE, many years a printer irt
this city. His remains were interredyeiter
day evening, attended by a refpeÂ£table mint
ber of citizens; &molt of the typographical
profefiion in Philadelphia.

written with such a spirit of cheerfulneft, religion
and good sense, as are the natural concomitants
of temperance and sobriety* Thfr mixture of
