The bill, in the present state, proposesâ
" That the operation of the resolutions o!
the late Congress of the United States, pas

whom were referred, on the Bth instant
a meflage from the President of the Unitec
States, and a letter from the secretary o
Hate, relative to certain expenses incurret
for the liberation and relief of Americai
sailors, imprefled to serve in the British na
vy, âmade a report, which was receivec
and read.
A number of petitions were read, pray
ing coinpenl'atio:i for services rendered

lor wounds received, for depreciation o

referred, or ordered to lie on the table.
Mr. Laurance presented a petitioi
from lundry merchants of the city of New
York, praying to be indulged in a longei
term for the payment of the duties on tea:
by them imported from China, âreferred t<
a special committee, to examine and re
port.
The following resolution, laid on the ta
ble by Mr. Livermore, on Monday last
was called up, and referred to a committei
of the whole house,
'Whereas the late Major Gen. N
Greene, on the Bth day of April, 1783, th<
more effectually to procure rations ant
supplies for the southern army of the Unitec
States, became bound as surety for Johi

aforefaid ; and also (hall make over foi
the use of the United States, all mortgages

Mr. Boudinot, from the committee tc
whom were referred the petitions of the
tanners of New-York, New-Jersey, ant
Pennsylvania, made a report which wi:
read, and ordered to lie on the table.âli
appears from this report, that an individu
al in Great-Britain enjoys a patent for the
importation of tanners' bark into that coun
try, and that his agents pur chafe up that ar
ticle, in different parts of the United States
at so high a price, as materially to injure
the tanning business here.âThis being con
fidered by the committee, as a fubjett o;
importance, and intimately connected wit!
the agricultural interefi, and the expori
trade, they are of opinion, that the confi
deration of it ought to be postponed to the
next session of Congress ; but recomment
in the mean time, as a temporary provision
additional duties on imported articles of tlx
leather manufacture.
A mefl'age was received from the Senate
by "Mr. Otis, informing the House that the
Senate have palled the bill making provi
sion for the defence of the frontiers, wit!
several amendments to which the concur'
rence of the House w as desired.

the fame ; and also a statement of the luu
dryfums of public monies, which may have
been entrusted to individuals, previous tc

ior the National Gazette.
Mr. FreneAu,
SQMK time ago, to my great astonish
ment, I oblerved by your paper that a
petition from the county of I redbrick,
011 the fubjeit of the Exajetaw, was referred
to tile Secretary of the Treasury. This
subject ha ; been so fully handled by able
the purpose of reform, which in particular
cases may be proper, that if my abilities
were equal to it, I fliould only attempt
some remarks 011 the petition I have notic
ed. Above all counties in the Union, the
one in queflion, from my general know
ledge ot it, should have been among the ve
ry fall to have made complaint. A large
manufactory of (tills has long been eita
blilhed in the heart of the county, where
they may be repaired or purchased at any
moment, and frequently obtained by bar
ter, for the produce of the farm. âStreams
of \\ ater are happily situated in every
neighbourhood for the convenience of this
business ; and the essential article of grain,
more especially of rye, Is as cheap, if not
cheaper, than 011 any part of the continent,
not more remote from navigationâThis
circumstance proceeds from the fertility of
the foil, the htnefs of the climate, and tLe
habit which the Dutch, and other farmers,
are in, ot making that species of' grain :
firev ood is also abundant, and althoughtfie
buildings necefl'ary are not expeijljvc,' yet,
whether offlone or v. ooc!, die materials arc
safily obtained ; mills too for the purpose
nf chopping the grain are mimefous âSpirits
from rye are almoit uitiverfally used, and in
i'uch demand that it is not easy to meet with
afihgle barrel for sale when the season closes
t'or carrying 011 the bufi'nefs.âlt may be
urged, that the augmentation of the price
bears hard upon the labourer ; to this I re
ply, that wherever he works, it is in com
mon found him; and that whenever it
happens otherwise, he may well afford to
purchase it himfelf, fuppoiTng it to be ne
cetfary, as 110 county offers more extrava
gant hire to the labouring man, than the
uue in view ; and that the necessaries of life
are to be had on the 1110 ft moderate terms.
Here it may not be amiss to observe, that
perhaps without a single exception, the dis
tillers have added the tax on all the Ipirk:
they had on hand, previous to the paymen;
of any tax, and like moll men in pursuit oi
gain, have, I am confident, used the mo
ment of complaint, to their own profit, b\
adding to the former price, a larger fun:
than the tax now amounts toâAre theft
fit complainants ? I am not what may be
termed a blind citizenâl hold it the duty
of every American to think, ast, speak, anc:
remonlirate as a free man when he has jufl
ciufe of complaint: but I fear, fir, that ir
every county or diftrift. there may be
found a man, or men, whose true charac
ters when traced, may be deemed prejudi
cial to the community, from a difconterit
ed, factious temper; or what is worse, en
joying all the rights of an American citizen,
difafle&e'd to its government; from this
class I do not exclude the native, ar.d with
real concern must own, that I have met
with filch mischievous characters, even
among them. I am a friend to every
branch of buiinefs, and wifli the di (tiller
veil, but aware of the inimenfe profit he
makes, and the impropriety of the present
petition, I hope, though Congress mult give
it a hearing, that they will not grant it.
From my lignature I have no local preju
dices, and therefore acknowledge my rea
diness to contribute, if necessary, to a hea
vy tax, provided it be founded on neceflity
and equality â a refpeÂ£tabie treasury chell
is to make us respectable as a nation.

Mr Freneau,
YOUR friends in Virginia will observe bj
the conllitution of the Philadelphia county
society that one objeCt of the infliction is to pro
mote domcftic manufactures.. Me are attentive
that our farms should not only supply our families
with houlhold linen, but as much as politic with
svery article ofcloathing. When it is not conveni
ent to have the different parts of the work perform
ed by the family, the poor neighbor?-, are employed
who for the most pait receive the produce of the
larm in pay for their fervicesjby this means a Am
ple exchange of property takes place between the
manufacturer and farmer, greatly to the advant
ige of both. I have now a coat in use made from

received from Cape-Fraxccis.]
Reply of the National Civil Deputies to the
persons all'embled at Croix des Bouquets.
(Continued, from our last, and concluded.)
IHE proclamation publifiied by us, was cal
culated to promote a like fpiritof oblivion in (his
:fland, and therefore precludes all discussion on
'nutters relative to the revolution, anterior to our
Publication ot a general amnelly in St. Domin
iÂ°-
We have consequently nothing to do with the
â aÂ£ls you meniion, further than as they may
crve to throw light upon the future, or as they
Tiav tend to excite compassion in our-breafls for
ihofe persons who have loft their relations and
their frit-nds, and in whole farrows we take our
full (hare.
In the third place. The national declaration
of rights is no more than an acknowledgement
ofthofe eternal truths, which are as well under
flood at ConÃaniinople or Indoftan, as they are
in France, and did exifl as well in the day.- of
Mo'es or Lycurgus, as at the conclulion of the
eighteenth ceniury.âNotwithftanciing which,
we fee slaves arr.ongft the Turks : the Lacede
monians had their Helots ; the Indians are dis
tributed into cojls, or clans; and the Ifraehtes
were parcelled into tribes. Happy is that na
tion, who, like France, is arrived to such a ma
turity ol judgment as to lay the foundations of
us confiitution 111 the rights of men and citizen
ihip 1 But oilier nations, who have composed
their systems out of inferior materials, are no
Ids bodies politic and inverted with fullpoweis
of government, than naiions the mod free.âln
luch, it ought to be the endeavor of the rulers
' and the ruled to extract thegreatefl polTible sum
ol happinels for every individual in the fphete
that is a digued him, after having fully investi
gated the relaiions in which the several ranks of
a nation fland to each other.
Our colonics, taking the word asafluallv un
derftoodin France, are the integral, or compo
nent parts of the empire; but, whoever uses
the word colony, understands thereby at the
lame time, a part of the empire separated from
the centre by the vast ocean, peopled by a mot
ley mixture ol whites, blacks, freemen, slaves;
and a mixture, again, of blacks ar.d whites.â
'i hey alio underfland thereby a part of the em
pire, which by the nature of its population, is
under the neceflity of adopting a local confiitu
tion, providing for the llate and condition of
slaves, as well as for the political government
Â°f tbofe who arealieady in pofTefTion of certain
civil rights, and claim the right of cirizenfhtp.
1 his opinion was embraced by the rellorers
of the liberties of France, from the firft moment
that they contemplated the situation of ihe colo
nies. The decree of March Bth, 1790, author
izes every colonial alfemblv, then in being, to
declare their opinion what kind of conllitution
would bell meet their withes, and the mode of
legislation and sdminiflrative government that
would be best adapted to promote their profpe
ri'.y. Ihe national assembly (you will observe)
was not ignorant that the colonial admimfliations,
then in being, were composed of whites only.
Ii follows, of courie, that, in their judgment,
the whites were alone in a capacity to legislate
for people of colour ; although the latter had
previously demanded a participation of equal
lights. They fupnofed too, at the Lme time,
that the whites would be so jull as to grant the
mulattoes every privilege, compatibleÂ°wiih ihe
order of things already eflablifhed in local cirÂ»
cumflances, and not too hastily destroying cer
tain prejudices, too powerful to be conquered by
mealures of precipitationâThey were alio con
vinced, that fu'cli ughts as were aQually grantctl
bv the whites would rather command the gra
titude of the mulattoes, than the contrary.
The national afTembly, in their decree of Oc
tober 12, 1790, firmly established it as a conflitu
lional article in the organization of the colonies,
that no general law refpefling the condition of
persons in the colonies should be enforced, ex
cept at the particular and formal requifmon of
the colonial alfemblies.
It however, by their decree of May 15, 17.91,
aflembly took upon itlelf to limit a part
of theie rights, they were carcful not to includc
luch ast in a conftituLing article ; having on the
13th of the fame month, enatled conftitutional
-1 y such laws as related to the condition of slaves.
We will observe that the national aflembly
comprehended in itlelf all the constituting and
legillating powers, which it never confounded,
but oil. the contrary, at all times used thegreatefl
precaution in declaring ccnftitutional such edicts
Â»S they did not suppose capable of alteration ;
as to others, reputed merely rcgleinentary laws,
they remained liable to their own revilion, as
well as that ol the subordinate Irgiflatures.âThe
iimpiecompanion of the two lafi mentioned de
crees, made for the fame parts ol the kingdom
within forty-eight hours of each other, is a proof
that the national assembly considered the firft as
irrevocably ordained while the second depend
ed upon the reception the law met with in the
colonies.
1 heir cautionary manner of proceeding was
fully juflificd by what has since happened in this
illand. Ihe mere report of the decree of May
1 th was the occasion of luch a horrid affray as
had well nigh overwhelmed in one indifcriini
nate deluge of blood, whites, mulattoes, and
slaves. '1 he danger was so prtfling that the
general commandant was obliged to adopt, upon
his own responsibility, such measures as he
thought mofl likely to prevent the extremity of
milchief : he went so far as to promise, for the
lake of laving the colony, that the decree should
not be published, although officially received.
1 he national assembly have done their endea
vour to annihilate the prejudices existing against
the mulattoes. They did not wish to ruin the
colonies, which are a source of prosperity to the
commerce and manufactures of the kingdom ;
much less to foment the honors of civil out
rage and calamity. It was their wifh 9 by cfta-
the confiitution, which the king has
lince accepted, to place even the humblest citizen
above the most ennobled fubje&s of other
countries, fhey conceived that between the
limple citizen, and him who is such in the fulleft
extent of the word in the colonics, there are
certain intermediate grades, or degrees of rank,
which can only be fairly eflimated 011 the spot
where they exifl. Being taught experience by
the unfortunate refill* of th*-.r benevolent e'ndeavours, they old, Dn the 24th of Septr*nbÂ»r lafy
inthefull extent of their conftituung poweis,
decree as follows :
" The laws refpcÂ£ting the fittiation of perfom
not free, and the political condition of mulattoe:
and free negroes, as well as the regulations re
lative to the execution cJ ihofe laws, shall be
pasTed by the colonial aflemblies, actually ex
ifting, and by thole that (hall succeed them.â
They (hall be executed provilionally, with th<
approbation of the governors of the colonics
during the space of one year for the Americai
colonies, and two years for the colonies beyon;
the Cape of Good-Hope, and fiiall be forth!
with presented for the ultimate approbation oj
the king, without any previous decree operating
to prevent the full exeicife of the power con
ferred by the present article upon the colonia
afTemblies."
This decree was accepted by the king as con
stitutional, and is no less the palladium of the
mulattoes of St. Domingo, than of the whites
The existing legislature, and its successor, coulc
make no alterations in the constitutional article!
after fettling the forms of revision ; neither couh
such alterations, if proposed, take place,
demanded by three lucceflive legislatures ; whicf
effectually prevents the conOitution from bein<
touched, with this view, for at least ten years
It is only, then, the colonial aflembly, a6tuall)
in being (since it has exited from the 24th o
September) that were capable of judging wha
laws should be made to ascertain the politica
rights of the mulattoesâand neither you, no
ourselves, not the king, nor the present legislaj
tive atlembly, nor the tour which (hall fucceev
it, can alter a fuigle iota of this right.
Such is the lawâAre you Frenchmen ?âRe
fpcct it ; obey the will of the conllitutiona
powers; and do not presume to infringe it unde
pretence of expecting regulating laVs, or 111 lit
ti.ring reproaches against a colonial affeiubly
confliruted by the nation and the king.
Will you undertake to fay that a declarator
of the rights of man, and of citizens, annuls <
decree that contradicts such a declaration ? Re
member, that youinhabit a colony, and that yoi:
cannot claim the general benefits of that declara
tion except by renouncing your own private
rights ; and that you have not the power toabo
lifli that state of slavery in the islands which th<
reltorers of French liberty have been compelled,
by the irrevocable decrec of destiny, to leave
u ntouched.
Will you dare so far to mi (interpret the de
.cree of the constituting body, as to oppose 1
with your public afis of agreement and you
treaty of peace ?âFirft, calculate the unitee
itrength of your fourteen revolted parishes, anc
then judge if it will be adequate to the making
head against the remainder of the colony ant
25 millions of people in old Fiance.
In the fourth place. Although it were trui
tnat perfett peace prevailed in your two depart
nients, in consequence of your concordats ant
treaties of pacification, this apparent calm may
notwithflanding, be the effeCt oi the ulurped pow
er of an armed crew of insurgents, and a v ; ola|
tion of all the constitutional principles ; and w<
cannot without an infringement of our duty
while we are taking measures to preserve orde
and tranquility, avoid declaring your treaties t(
be null and of no efFeCt. The reasons we havt
already assigned are fufficfent to prove this.
We will add, that French citizens cannot
conftiiutionally, form themselves into a body, 01
aflume the functions of government, except ir
the three following cases. âFuji, In primar)
afTemblies, for the lolepurpofe of naming repre
fentatives, and such public officers, the choic<
of whom lies with the people, abitracted frorr
every other objeÂ£t.âSecondly, 111 aflembl-ies o
the commonalty, which cannot be held, chal
lenged. or authoiiied unless for purposes fimpl)
municipal-, or such as have for their ob eÂ£t tiit
absolute intcrefls of the community. AH othei
.convocations and deliberations of the people, o
parties of the people, for other purposes, are voic
and illegal. âThirdly, In aflemblies petitionary
As the right to petition is inherent, it camio
be delegated, neither to deputies nor to admi
niftrative councils, nor be excrcifed collettivelj
by any public bodies or association of citizen;
whatever.
These, gentlemen, are the only three cases ir
which it is lawful, by the conOitution of France
for people to aflembLe to deliberate on politica
acts; and in all these three cases, they are
10 aflemble with arms.
From the time that the French constitu
tion was definitively fettled by the coniji
tuting body, and since its acceptance by the
king, the articles we have cited are confi
clered asfo many axioms, 01* felf evideni
truths, at the very mention of which ever)
good frenchman is bound to submit him

not waste time in repeating to you those wife
reasons, upon the authority of which theft
great queitions have been decided by some
of the most enlightened men of the prefeni
age. We only fay to you, in one word.
that if you are French, you will immedi
ately renounce your unjust pretentions]
your unconflitutional demands, which not
only tend to disturbing the repose of the co
lony, but menace the supremacy of the tia
tion. We tell you then, in the anguish of cur
hearts, that ifyouperfy in your errors, we J ha/fit

by the king, to enable us to behold itl yon

Doubt not, gentlemen, that the Colonial

them every privilege cempatible with the
organization of colonial government ; and

The celebrated Ruffian general Potemkin
having so long flourilhed on the political
and military stage of Europe, the follow
ing brief account of so renowned a cha
racter will not be displeasing to our read
ers :
" Prince Gregory Potemkin, a Tau
riqtic, was very remarkable for the numer
ous titles he bore : he was field marshal and
commander in chief of all the Ruffian ar
mies ; commander of the regular and light
cavalry of the fleets in the Black sea, in the
sea of Azof, and the Cafpianfea; senator
andprefident of the college of war; go
vernor general of Catharinoflaw, arid Tau
ria ; aid-de-camp general and chamberlain
to the Empress ; infpeftor general ofthe ar â 
my, colonel of the regiment of Preobraf
chenfki guards; chief of the corps of the
guards of cavaliers ; chief of the manufac
tories of arms and cannon of the Ruffian
empire ; grand hetman of the CofTacks,
those of Catharinoflaw and the Black sea ;
knight ofthe Ruffian orders of St. Andrew,
St. Alexander Newki, St. George, Wool -
doomir of the firft class, and of St. Ann ; of
the Prussian order of the Black Eag'le ; and
ofthe Polish order of the White Eagle, and
St. Stanisflaw ; of the Danish order of the
Elephant; and of the Swedifli order of Se
raphims. His career has been very glori
ous, 110 reverse of fortune or disgrace ever
tarnished it; but whatever enterprizes he
undertook were always Crowned with suc

This great man died the beginning of Oc
tober last near J allay, on the Ruffian fron
tiers, of a pestilential camp fever, that has
raged in those parts. It is intimated in the
European papers, thathisdeath will have a
considerable effect upon the politics of that
quarter of the world, particularly in being

may be proper to add, that Prince Potemkin

On TRAVELLING PLANTS.
[TranJJated from tie Frit: b. J
BESIDLS thole plants that are itatlonnry,
fhere are manifeftlv others, whlfch frequently
their places of abode, and even employ
tbemielvea in going round the globe. I do nor
i:Â«4ny, however, that the greater part of these tra
veling plants had originally some center of natÂ£4
pitj, a steep rock, or an island embosomed in the
occin., from whence they might have been propa
gate* into differen. parts of the world. This, by
the is, with me, a great proof that our
dobe\s but of a recent origin ; fir.ce, if it was
very ancient, all the combinations of plants that
can evet happen, woaid have been long ago com
pleted in every part of the earth. Thus, for in
llance, there would not have been an island dif.
covered iri the East or Weft-Indies but would
nave been jvUnted with cocoa nut trees, carried
.hither by the various currents of the ocean. T he
native place of this ipecies of tree seems to hav<
been the Maldivia islands, from whence they havt
not yet spread into all theislandvof the Indian ocean
I he philosopher, Francis Leguat, and his unforn
nÂ«te companions, who wÂ»re shipwrecked in 1690,
an<J were the firfl human inhabitants oftheJittÃ
ill and Rodrigo, one hundred leagues to the east
ward 0/ the IHe of France, found there no cocog
nut trees. During the time, however, that the)
refiJed on this solitary and secluded spot, the
currents dtjfted on shore, At different times, Â«
number of c&coa nuts, already sprouting j as i;
Providence wiihed to incline them to remain ir
the island, and cultivate the foil, by this ufefu
and agreeable prclent. Francis Leguat was en
tirely at a loss to know from whence these nuts
weighing five or fix pounds each, could pofiiblj
have come j at last, however, he concluded the]
mull have been brought by ;he currents frorr
the island of St. Brande, about, eighty league;
norr.i-eaft of Rodrigo.âSo that u appears thai
these two iHands, from the beginning, of the
world, had never before communicated all thei:
vegetable produ&ions to each other, altho' litu
ateu diredely in the midfl of an immense current
which, according to the season of the year, set
fix months in an eastern, and fix months in 1
Weft era di re&ion.
M. Leguat and his companions took care t(
plant these cocoa nuts, which in about a veaf am
an half grew upwards of four feet in height. Sucj
an immediate present from heaven, however
could not prevail upon them to remain in thi
charming island. Notwithstanding the remon
lhances of M. Leguat, his companions, not con
tented to live without the society of women, buil
themlelves 2 boat and took their departure fron
this peacefal abodeâmisfortunes and difaflefsJir
abundance, were the consequence, and fcarceli
any ot them lurvived to reach the continent o'
Africa. As for myfelf (fays M. Leguat, in hi:
account of their I have no doubt, bui
that if we had reposed the necefl'ary confidence ir
a wife and over-ruling Providence, it would b)
some means or other have sent us women into the
island, as it had before sent us cocoa nuts !
