Vol. I.
To the Editor of the National Gazette.
S I R,
SHOULD any individual attempt tc
call in question the right to repre
sentation in the people of the lower dif
triÂ£l of Georgia, if luch a query did noi
fpringfrom despotic principles, it woulc
only be termed ignorance in the ex
treme ; but it being universally and in
dubitably granted that the people o
the lower diftrift of the-(late of Georgi;
have a right to representation, so b)
viriue of that right, two persons are in
dividually presented to them as candi
dates for election. The people convenec
gave in their votes, but some time aftej
( ongrefs declares one of these two can
didates to be unduly elected : now le
us fee what will folldw. The people
have a right to representation ; two can
didates only offer, one of which the)
have a right, and one of which they afe
to choose ; but Congress declares thai
the votes of one of these two candidates
are illegally given in, thereforethe othei
must be the person legally elected : the
people having a right to representation.
coni'equently one of these candi
dates must be constitutionally fcoffeflec
of the' right of representing by choice o!
the people. If not, the people's righi
to representation is totally fubvertectâ
If any gentlemen will shew, that Gen
Jackion's right to a feat in Congress i:
not a light, founded on a right of the
people of the lower diftrift of Georgi;
to representation, it will be a grand dif
covery ; it will bea short way to arifto
cracy, which has been hitherto unex
plored on this fide the Atlantic.
Can the citizens of the United State;
be so blinded by federalifrn, as not tc
peixeivo the dangerous Kndorfcy oi
such a precedent ? certainly not.
But the conflitution fays, each House
fhallbethe judgeof theele&ion returns,
& qualificationsof its own members, and
therefore that the House of Represen
tatives might the more ftriftly and pro
perly ast in the capacity of a court oJ
judicature, while in its Legislative au
thority, entered into rcfolutions which
were to be to them laws to guide anc
direst them, so that in the course of the
approaching trial they might not con
found the legislative with the judicia;
authority. Yet, was it ever known ir
a court of judicature in a cafe of righl
and wrong that the plaintiff by produc
ing incontestable evidences to prove the
illegality of the defendant's claim, did
not thereby establish his own ripht r
And what do we next behold P Con
gress ading in the character of three
diftinft persons. If any gentleman wili
deny it, then must he allow that the
proceedings of Congress in the cafe Â©J
Generals Wayne and Jackson to be
more ariftocratical, and more arbitrary
than ever the British Parliament was ir
the cafe of Wilkes and Luttrel ; yet the
British Parliament too well knew the
right to representation in the Freehol
ders of Middlesex county to seclude
both the candidates, which would toe
glaringly cut off their right to rdprefen
tation, and thereby alarm the whole nati
on, but that they might get the man (foi
no other they could get) whose princi
ples they knew would more uniformk
harmonize with their own, they magni
fied the obje&ions made again ft Wilkes,
his principles being then obnoxious tc
their measures ; and perhaps some have
veryjuftly apprehended that a fimilai
motive was an actuating principle in
the precluding General Jackson from a
feat here.
By aggravating the objections made
against Wilkes, they endeavoured there
by to have some pretext, however tri
fling, topalliate their arbitrary proceed
ings in hauling in a man over the heads
of the people whose principles they ab
horred : but the cafe as to the candi
dates here, is not applicable, for Gene
ral Jackson has evidently proved the il
legality of General Wayne's elc&ion,

and Congress lias as evidently confirm
ed the validity of his testimony. But
Congrefsgoes farther than the British
Parliament, by declaring, that neither of
the candidates have a right to a feat
with them, and so by the word of theii
power cuts off the right to representa
tion in the lower diftritt of Georgia
yet how it comes they are both fecludecl
and the lower diftriti remains unreprc
fented, I'll leave to the political philofo
pher to account for. Should any gen
tleman endeavour to confute what ha:
been here iaid, we will proceed to the
firft, and fee how far Congress has aftec
in the charatter of three diflinft per
sons, and thereby flopped beyond th<
limits of the constitution.
ihey in their judicial capacity paffec
judgment on General Wayne's ele&ior
by declaring its invalidity, yet the ide;
of seven eighths of the people annexed ti
lucli a declaration, was, that by Con
;jrels' declaring the illegality of the
one, it established the right of the other
a right existing, and that only betweer
the two candidates ; but the wifefl ar>.
liable to mistake, and the people fel
their disappointment.
In all cales coming before a court ol
judicature there mufl be at lead foui
persons concerned ; a plaintiff, defend
ant, testimony, and judge: And now.
in the proceedings of Congress againfl
the valMity 'of General Jackson's eiefti
on, whom do we behold as plaintiff r
why, Congressâwhom do we fee as tes
timony ? why Congressâand who the
judge P why who but Congress ? But
the contlitution fays, Each House fliali
be ihe judge of the ele&ipn, &c. Ye;
truly : yet in that article the conllitu
tion never said nor never meant, to invou
in Congress a power to etiter intojudg
ment againfl the ele&ion of any candi
date without some allegation being firfl
made to them by a citizen of the Unitec
States. But who petitioned againfl thÂ«
validity of General Jackson's election i
why none, and might not Congress b)
the fame authority witlr which the>
precluded General Tackfon expel j
member from Virginia
or Pennsylvania ; nay, even the wholi
minority might be expelled!
Awake ! arise ! ye Freemen of Geor

The House proceeded to the further con
federation of the two additional fefliou;
proposed by the Senate to the Militia
Bill.
The unlimited power which this amend
ment would confer on the Prefiilent, ol
calling out the citizens of the United States,
and fubjeftiilg them to Martial Law,
was the ground of a warm opposition,
which was supported to a late hour, when
the House adjourned without taking the
question.
Thursday April 12.
The memorial of John Gibbons, treasurer
of the Hate of Georgia, was referred to the
Secretary of War, to examine, and report.
Two enrolled bills, viz.
A bill, concerning confnls and vice con

A Kill to compenrtite the trustees of the

Mr. Speak?p, andt j>reÂ£ented to the Prefi
cent of the United States for his approba
tion, together with a bill to alter the tiflief
for holding the circuit courts in certain
diftrifts of the United States, and the re
presentation bill.
Mr. Secretary Lear delivered a mefTage,
notifyiug the House, that the President hac
approved and signed an ast to ascertain the
bounds of a trad of land purchaled by J.
C. Symmes.
A bill from the Senate, for regulating
procefies in the courts of the United States
&c. was (together with the amendment:
thereto, reported by the feleft committee
referred to a committee of the whole, anc
made the order of the day for to-morrow.
The House resumed the consideration o:
the two additional feclions proposed by the
Senate to the militia bill, vesting the Pre
sident with a perpetual and unlimited pow
er to call out the militia at anc
fubjeft them to martial law, &c. &c.
The fubjeft Was again Warmly debated :
and among other arguments in favour ol
concurring with the Senate, it was said
that, in cafe, for infhmce, of an infiirrec
tion in the city of Philadelphia, it might
perhaps be expedient for the executive tc
lead an army of Jersey militia across the
Delaware, te qtlell it; and the conduct of
fbme people in the back parts of Pennsylva
nia, (who, it was said, refufed to pay cer
tain taxes, and had insulted feme of the
officers of government) was mentioned a;
a proof of the neceffiw ps tiling compulfon
means to enforce obedience to the laws oJ
the union. It w-as said on the other hand
that nothing could have a stronger tenden
cy to create jealoilfies and disunion betweer
the Hates, than to empower the Prefidenl
thus to make the militia of one state the in
struments to be employed 111 subduing the
citizens of another ; and that the power;
which the Senate meant to confer on hiir
by this amendment, would be tonfiderabl)
greater, than are poffefled by the King oi
England. See, See.
Mr. Kittera moved the following a
mendment :
'Provided neverthe'efs that they [the
militia] fliall not be obliged to march be
yond the limits of the United States; nor
ihall any person, enrolled in the militia a<
aforefaid, be compelled to serve thereir
more than two months in fix : and thai
this authority be continued, in the Prefi
dentof the United States, for one year
from the palling of this law."
A division being called for, three separate
questions were taken on the several clauses
of this proviso ; and all palled in the nega
tive,âseveral gentlemen voting against it,
who declared that they would vote in the
affirmative, if there was any probability
that the Senate's amendment would be a
greed to.
Mr. Fitzfimons then moved the follow
ing amendment : â
â¢Provided always, and be it further en
acted, that the powers herein given to the
President of the United States, for calling
out the militia, be and continue in force
till the end of the next session of Cengrefs,
and no longer.
Some gentlemen thinking this motioii
out of order, Mr. Speaker declared it to be
in order ; and on an appeal to the House,
and the question being taken, the decifioti
of the chair was confirmed.
The queltion being then taken on Mr-
Fitzfunons's proportion, palfed in the af

The other of the additional feftions was
negatived almost unanimously.
A committee was then appointed (or
[notion of Mr. Gerry) to prepare a bill or
bills for calling forth the militia, when ne
ceflary, to execute the laws of the union,
0 suppress insurrections, and repel inva
[ions.
Some gentlemen wished, that (until the
Dufinefs entrusted to this committee
(liould be in some degree of forwardnefs
the militia bill should be detained in the
House, and no meflage sent to the Senate,
to notify thein of the proceedings and de

No order however was given 011 the
"Ã¼bject ; and the business was left to take

Several letters that palled between the

For the NATIONAL GAZETTE.
On the originating Revenue Bills by the
Secretary.
[In continuation from our lajl. ]
IT is alio asserted that members, or even
select committees, convinced of their
want of capacity, will have recourse to the
Secretary for information and assistance,
and that it is better to bring that informa
tion and assistance into the House openly
ior the equal benefit of all the members,
than to have it introduced in the way of
private influence. This argument is also
delusory. If the Secretary's reporting fyf
tems and efl'ays, would prevent private in
fluence, it would at lead be one recom
mendation : but so far from this, it gives Â£
much greater inducement and facility tc
private influence. The minister will na
turally form a union of views and senti
ments with some influential members, whc
will understand his systems previous to theii
being reported, and be prepared to fupporl
them ; hence some local interests will be
comparatively opprefled or overlookec
more than others, to secure the support ol
a party on the floor. The minister's cha
racter being at stake, he and his friends wil
make greater exertions ; from fuel) afource
we may expeit to hear of bargains, combi
nations, deception, and all the arts of ;
ttrookeel and mysterious policy. Therefore
the influential power of originating system
and transmitting arguments, is much th<
more objectionable because of that private
nfluenee, and even corruption to which i
is an efficient stimulus.
Though from the infancy of our govern
ment when thispraÂ£lice of originating re
t'enue bills was introduced, we may reason
ably conclude that the novelty of our fitua
tion and the urgency of our affairs diftatee
the measure, yet we know from the expe
rience of all governments, that it is not ne
cefl'ary to open avenues for corruption, no
make apologies for indolence and inatten
tion in public bodies. It is too soon to in
Julge a suspicion relpecting our virtue, ane
yet, young as our government is, there art
not wanting those who fufpeft that fron
the superior knowledge some persons hat
of the funding system, while in embryo
enormous and uncandid speculations wen
made : it is alio iuggefted, that an encreafi
of the debt of th: union, and the molt ob
noxious of all taxes, could never have fuc
:eeded, if it had not been for the influence
irifing from other causes. But public ere
lito :s, too many of whom get their wealtl
Without ufeful industry, complain, that i;
-he Secretary doth not continue to origi
nate the fifcal arrangements, they would ge
nto confuiion, the credit of the Unitec
States would fail, that we would reduce
.he Secretary of the Treasury to a meii
:ommiftioner ol the revenue, and that he
would not be responsible for the meafur.es,
*c. This is alio proving too much, if ii
jroves any thing.
That information of the actual ftatc oi
.hmgs, respecting the execution and effici
ency of the laws, is to be derived throng!
executive officers, is admitted ; but if th<
irrangement of the revenue laws and the
'redit of the United States depends upoi
he minister's power to originate the fyf
eins and fettle the principles, it depends or
i {lender thread indeed ; certainly he can
lot originate revenue systems without the
Jermiliion ot the House ; therefore they car
with the fame ease reject this mode oj
>ringing them forward, as they can rejetl
lis systems when reported. With refpeÂ£ttc
educing or degrading the Secretary, it me
"its no answer ; the Seci etary's office wai
nltituted for the use of the government,
ind not the government for the use of the
secretary's office.
This method was introduced in the infan
cy of the government by a reprefentatior
low known to be very unequal. The ven
general odium that even the appearance o:
minilterial influence has among the mass o!
Jie citizens, will certainly produce a rejec
tion of that mode of doing bufmefs, as foor
as an impartial representation takes the
floor, if not foonerâtherefore it would be
wiser for the public creditors to put theii
ttonfidence in Congress, and support the
. efpeCtability thereof among the people
than pin their dependence upon the influ
:nce of a minister. I expect there will al
ways be found wisdom and iultice enougl
n Congress to provide honestly for the dif
harge of her debts ; but less extravagance
Hid lolly among the public creditors woute
â¢ender them more rel'peftable. They cer
tainly have a common interest with the
toinmunity, with this they ought to have
jeen contented, anel not to have erected oi
ought after separate and diftinft moniet
nflitutions, intcrefts and influence. If the
â¢evenue laws being originated by the Se
tretary occasions them to be such as thej
would not otherwise be, or disposes mem
jers to vote for them that otherwise wouk
lot, an undue ministerial influence is in
troduced. If the systems and argument:
â¢eported by the Secretary are not calcula
ted to influence the proceedings of the
louse, they are of no use. If they are cal
:ulated for this purpose, they ought not tc
>e permitted.
But there is another circumstance attend;
this mode of conducing business which v
ughly objectionable, if not unconflitution
alâl mean not only the references of the
ways and means, to the minister, but alio
the petitions of the citizens. That claim
of a judicial nature should be referred to a
suitable officer, in order to have the facts
Itated and arranged, is perhaps not impro
per, as public bodies are not well calcula
ted for personal invefligations. But thai
the raoft important public business or the
memorials or remonltrances of the citizen:
refpefting the principles or operations ol
general Jaws should t>e sent for any fhortet
or longer tune out of the power of the
House to which they are dire&ed, is impro
per and disgusting to the citizens. How
;ame the Representatives to have a right to
jut the proper fubjefts of legislative deli
beration out of their power, perhaps for
nonths together ? The Legislature are the
.-onftitutiopal judges of the time of doing
nifinefs, as well as the fubje&s, and it is
:hey only that are responsible with refpeft
:o time, as well as principles.
I will feleft one dangerous effect this
>raftice might produce, if ever we fliould
lave an artful minister ; he might keep the
noft important bufmefs back till the end
>f a session, when the members being anxi
jus to go home, would not have leisure for
erious and critical invertigation âThis nnv
>e thought an undue reflection, but I will
kv'V'j-" members of
jublic bodies, if it is not juftifiec! by the ex
perience of almost every adjournment, and
ht'.nnlTfa-" 06 Â° f 3 law bein g pasTed at
he end of a session, is not frequently men
.ioned as an apology for its defects. Th
langer of this IS encreafed by the minister
ilways having it in his power to combine
us views with that of foine influential mem
)crs of the Legislature.
That a Secretary who is pofTeffed ofta
ents, pays constant attention to the business
>. finance, and has the materials for calcu
atiori and estimates among his hands, (hould
ligeft revenue systems with greater facility
indtheoretic ingenuity, I will readily grant;
laving out one will to accommodate, mull
ontribute to this. But that he will digest
ifyftemmorefuitable to the interests and
vill of the people, I deny. He doss not,
rom his iituation or manner of life, par .
ake of the fame interefis with the mass of
he people ; he has not a practical know
edge of their circumstances, and therefore
san imperfea judge of their will. He is
inder the ne effity of receiving information
rom the particular class among which he
noves, or from the under officers who are
he creatures of his own appointment, and
vho, n the law which they execute is an
ibnoxiops one, will be of the dregs of the
>eople or hated by them; and such as these
lave been the friends of oppression in all
ountries.
Perhaps the excellence and success of the
irefent funding law may be adduced in
jroof of the wisdom of ministerial revenue
yft ems. For my own part, I think the
uncling system much the worse for the ar
lficial refinement for which it is eminent
certainly since the original obligation was
lot adhered to, the interest might have
)een uniformly lowered, or a part of the
irincipal rejected in such a manner as to
lave been of equal advantage to the credi
ors, and as light upon the revenues as the
jrefent complex system. It is certainly
ounded on theory rather than a knowledge
>f the circumstances of the United States,
surely no body but the minister and those
nterefted in, or dazzled with speculations,
hink that preventing the debt from beina
M.d, other wife than in small and distant in
tallments, gave it a value equal to one
third of the annual interest. What person,
who is poflefTed of 10001. in certificates
upon the interest of which he designs to
upport himfelf or family, will think the
irredeemable quality a fufficient equivalent
for being obliged to live upon ac\. a year
lnftead of 601. I am not here deciding
the public were able to provide
b per cent on all the principal of the debt,
or whether since the contrast was not coml
plied with, the mod meritorious ought not
to have been firft or best served ; these en
quiries are now too late- but I believe the
irredeemable quality and variety of parts
only give them a capacity of being a fitter
liibject for speculating combinations, which
lometimes buoy them up to a fictitious va
lue; &whenever the artificial bubble bursts
they fink to the level of their real value a
gain,& instead offupplying the place ofmo
ney, as they might have done under a more
(miple arrangement, they give greater de
mand tor it and raise the rate of interest.
There can be no doubt but that Congress
might have done equalj uftice to their credi
tors without such ministerial refinements
and much less injury to theftate of society'
One further observation, and I shall con
clude at this time. âIt is already observed
that the Secretary Â©f the Treasury is an
officer appointed by and dependent on the
pleasure of the President; his sole business
is of an executive nature, and it is a fun
damental principle in government, that the
legislative and executive powers should be
kept dilhnfl and feparateâtherefore dele
gating the power of propounding princi-
pies, originating fyfterhs, and bringing ar
guments officially before the House, is con
trary to the principles of a free govern
ment. It is unreasonable to entrust any
person with a power of dictating to the le
gislature the rules by which he himfelf shall
be governed, or the principles of those laws
which it is his duty to executeâCertainly
lfthe Hou.e of Representatives are incapa
ble of originating revenue bills, and must
employ an officcr for that purpose, it ought
to be a person chosen by, and dependent on
that House. If th,e canftitution will not
permit this, much less can it permit an ex
ecutive officer to be employed.

On the 26th of November last a Court

" unofficerly and unfoldierly behaviour, in
fhamefully retreating from, or for fear of
the enemy, on the fourth of this monthâ
also, for scandalous behaviour in endeavor
ing to prevent a guard from going with pro

charges the Major plead not guiltyâ after a
full and fair trial before a court martial, the
court gave it as their opinion that " the se

acquit him with honour. âThe prosecuti

Several companies of militia have march

Landholders in Hampshire are cautioned,
in one of their late papers, to be on their
guard against swarms of southern specula
tors who have been lately attempting to
make large purchases of uncultivated lands
in that state. The harvest of paper specu
lation being over, it is thought these nim
ble gentlemen are now turning their atten
tion to landed property.
The two following paragraphs are from
a New-York paper of last Thursday :
'â¢ Electioneering discussions seem so totally
to absorb the attention of our citizens,
that they take no notice of the progreflive
accumulation of burdens which the general
government is imposing on our commerce.
An augmentation of the present rates of du
ty, as proposed by the Secretary of the
Treasury, mult inevitably tend to oppress
the mercantile, and with it every other
class of interests in this country. That the
present system of import is prefied beyond
its natural bounds, must be obvious to eve
ry person engaged in commerceâthat it
far exceeds any commercial impoiitions by
the states, previous to the ratification of the.
federal conflitution, is indubitable."
" Experiments have been made in vari
ous parts of this country to erect and sup
port manufactories of certain fabricsâwith
what success let the present situation of the
greater part declare. Strenuous efforts
were made to raise one in the city of New-
York ; but notwithltn'nding every endeavor
of tile reputable characters who patronized
and supported it in its infancy, it has been
gradually declining,& is now alrnoft extinct.
The fame result may be predicted with ref
peft to that proposed to be established in
ISew-Jerfey. Ihe notoriously embarrassed
lituation of its pecuniary funds, as far as
they have been collected, and of the man
(Col. Duer) with whom the projeCt often
hbly originated, are strong indications that
the period of its ultimate difl'olution is not
Very remote."
The fpeculatingtribe in this city (fays a
New-York paper) are funk into the abyss
of inextricable confufion, yet seem to be in
sensible of the dreadful labyrinth in which
they are entangledâinstead, however, of
exerting themselves to preserve some kind
of manly character, they are endeavoring
to lower themselves flill mot-e by descend
ing to the mean level of filh-women and
common street boxers !
A correfpondcnt remarks, t hat the late decifior

matter of high gratification 10 every republicar
aid friend of liberty : fir.ee it allures the pcoplt
of ample projection to their constitutional righ :
and privileges, against any attempt of legiflativf
or executive oppreflion. And whilst we view
the exercise of this noble prerogative of th- ju ge:
in the hands of such able, wife and independen
men, as compose the present judiciary of the Uni
ted States ; it affords a jull hope that, not only
fu ure encroachments will be prevented, but alio,
that any exifling law of Congress, which may be
supposed to trench upon the constitutional light:
of individuals, or of Hates, will, at convenieni
seasons, undergo a revision : particularly thatfoi
cftablilhing a National Bar.k; which being an
incorporation a d cxclufive charier of privileges,
violative, as it is conceived, of the independeni
lights and sovereignty ofthe Hates, is deemed by
many of the enlightened citizens of Aincnca, tc
be repugnant io the spirit, meaning and letter ol
the Constitution, and is regarded as a mere ftalf
engine of ministerial contrivance ; on the pre
tence to aid fifcal operations, but in reality, tc

COMMUNICATION'S.
A paragraphia in the Gazette of theUnitetl
States, whose remarks have been copied
into some of the public prints, would gravely
persuade us, that those, who write againfl
the measures of government, are no more
than ' a dozen pefons!' 1 It is well he is can
did enough to allow there are even twelve
honest men in America, who still preach up
found doctrine. But it is asked, whether
the apostles of the contrary doctrine a
mount to half that number?â From the
dull sameness of the style," it may be pre
sumed, that small indeed is the number o
those worthy gentlemen, who employ theii
leaden pens in eking out those drowsy ful
fome panegyrics upon government, which
every body now begins to smoke, and the
high-fliers themselves can hardly read with
-1 out a sneer.
If the cxcife law has not promoted tem

the purchasers of that article in other

usual ingenuity, deviled a plan so relieve
diflillers from the hardlhips they fuffer in
consequence of being thus branded: and
accordingly, in his elaborate report on the
Excise, he recommends to Congress to
screen them from detection, by ordering the
fame brands to be affixed to foreign spirits
as to those of domestic manufacture. But
it is to be hoped the southern members
will not consent to have their conltituents

OJIKHETA, the INDIAN.
IT was mentioned in the National Gazette
of March 26, that the Indian Peter Jaquttte or
[Otfequetce] alias, Ojikbctaone of the Oneidi
Indian chiefs, who lately died, and was buried
in this city, had been complimented with the
former of tnofc names by the Maiqu de la FaÂ»-
eite, wiÂ»h whom he went to Fiance, and conti
nued several years. âIt is certain that there have
been inlttinces of many Europeans giving a
name, peculiar to their own country, to fava?es
adopted and befriended by them ; as likewise is
1 le cuflom among some of thelndian nations, with
regard to foreigners living with them or under
their proteffion. In the present indancc, howe

command of the army.
Philadelphia, March 26, 1792.
Sir,
I BEG leave to offer you my unfeigned thanlci
for the honor conferred upon me, by the ap
poinfment to the command of the army of th<
United States the last campaign. Though tha
campaign was unfortunate, i am not confciou
that any thing within my power, to have produ
ced a more happy iU'ue, was negle&ed. As I wa:
prompted to accept that command by no motive:
of either ambition or interest, but by a ferven
wifli to be offervice to my country, and a belief
perhaps too fondly entertained, that I could be f<
â 1 hat I am led to decline it in future, proceed!
neither from disgust nor disappointment.
Having been much afflitted with sickness dur
ing nearly the whole of the campaign, though ]
flatter myfelf the public interests did not futfe,
by it, and though my health is now tolerably reÂ«
stored, my constitution has received a very seven
/hock, and I might not again be able to go thro
the weight of business which necefi'arily follows thi
command ol an army.
Altho , fir, I am myfelf peifuaded that ever]
thing was done, in the coui fe of the la ft campaign,
that could be done on my part, fully to anfwei
the public expectation, yet it is denied by some
doubted by many, and known to but few out o
the army. A wish to reGi'fy the public opinion
and a duty that J conceive J owe to myfelf, induce
me to request that an inquiry into my conduf
may be instituted ; when that is over, j may hopi
to be permitted to resign the cummifiion of Ma
j or-General, which 1 now hold. Should the re
iult of the inqu.ry be that, in any instance, tin
o'uties of my itacion were negletted, or that I die
not improve every hour and every opportunity f<
the beil advantage, or that the operations of thi
army, after it was in a condition to operate, wen
delayed one moment in consequence of my illness
1 shall patiently submit to the merited censure.
1 o whoever may be appointed my successor,
fliall be happy, fir, to give every light and infor
mation my lituation, as General of the army, o
as Governor of the Weftem Territory, put in m :
power to obtain, and to evince to you, fir, and i<
the woild, that the confidence you were pleased t<
iepofe in me, was not misplaced.
V/ith every sentiment of gratitude, of refpe#
and, allow me to add, as alfe&ion, 1 have ch<
honor to be, Sir,
Your molt obedient fervanf,
ARTHUR St. CLAIR.
The President of the United States.
United States, March 28th, 1792.
Sir,
YOUR knowledge of the country North-wel
ps the Ohio, and of the resources for an army if
its vicinity, added to a full confidence in your mi
litary character, founded on mature experience
induced my nomination of you to the command 0
the troops on the frontiers.
our liefire of replying any errors of the pub
lie opinion, relatively to your conduit, by an in
veltigation of a court of enquiry, is highly lauda
ble, and would be readily complied with were th,
rneafure practicable But a total deficiency o
officers, in a&ual service, of competent rank t,
form a legal court, for that purpose, precludes th,
power- of gratifying your wiflies on the occasion.
J he intimation of your readiness to afford you
fucceflor all the information of which you are ca
pable, altho' unnecefl'ary for my personal convic
tion, mull be regarded as an additional evidence o
the goodness of your heart, and of your attach
ment to your country.
I am, Sir,
With esteem and regard,
Your mod obedient servant,
G. WASHINGTON
Major-Gencral Arthur St. Clair.
Philadelphia, March 3 \Ji, 1732.
Sir,
I HAVE had the honor to receive your lette
cf the *Sth inflant. While I lament that cir
cumftances prevent an investigation into my con
dudt, by a court of enquiry, I cannot but acqui
efce in the reasons you have afligned why it can
not take place j and I beg leave to present nv
thartks for the define to have gratified me, had i'
bren practicable, which you have been pleased t(
Hianifeft.
In my letter of the 26th, I expretfed an inten
t.oo of retiring from the army, when the enquin
ftould be over The only reason 1 had for wilh'
ing to retain my commilfion until that time was
that if any mifcondufl (hould appear in the courf
of the enqmry, I might be amenable to a cour
martial, which a resignation would have preclu
ded. The Houfeof Representatives, fir, have di
â  eaed an enquiry into the causes of the failure o
.he lafl campaign to be made by a committee o
their own body the fame reason that influence,
me when a court of enquiry was contemplated
operates now with equal force, and therefore i
may be proper that I Ihould flill retain m c ' om
million; but, as it will soon be requisite tha
iome person Ihould be at the head of the ar mv
who is to continue to command it, it is necelTary
fir, that I Ihould inform you explicitly, which
now do, of my fixed resolution to resign the mo
ment the enquiry is finilhed, fiiould r,o fault b,
found, that any embairafTment which may exist
with refpedt to pioviding a successor for me, ma,
be removed.
Be plealed, fir, to observe that my sole obieft i
to give eftedt to public justice, in ihe usual wa,
by a court-martial, ihould it appear that, an-
what/oner, the misfortunes of the lat
campaign can be attributed to me ; and it is th<
proper, and I believe the only tribunal, where mi
litary crimes and mifconduft can be enquired in
o and p-jiiilhed ; or where an officer's reputation
infinitely dearer than life, can be vindicated â
Should the public service, however, require thai
another officer of the fame rank with me be aP
pointed immediately, I am ready to,make the re
signation forthwith, notwithstanding that it may
leem to proceed, and at a distance will be suppo
sed to have arisen, from a sense that the volume
of calumny and defamation, invented by malioe*
which is daily pouring from the press into the
public ear, has coo much foundation for me to
meet it, âthat I fhrinlt from the conferences,
and chufe to flielter myfelf in a private station : â
I am ready, fir, upon this occasion, as I have
bren upon all others, to facrifice every private and
personal feeling and consideration to the public
good.
I have the honor to be, fir,
Your most obedient servant,
ARTHUR St. CLAIR.
The President of the United States.
United States, April 4, 1792.
Sir,
I HAVE read and duly considered your letter
of the 31ft ultimo.
The reasons you offer for retaining yourcom
miflion, until an opportunity should be presented,
if neceflary, of investigating your condudt in every
mode prescribed by law, would be conclusive with
me, under any other circumstances than the pre
sent.
But the eftabli/hment of the troops allows only
of one Major-General. You have manifefted
your intention of retiring, and the efientral inter
ests of the public require that your fuccefl'or ihould
be immediately appointed, in order to repair to
the frontiers.
As the Koufe of Representatives have been
piealed to institute an enquiry into the cauftfs of
the failure of rhe late expedition, 1 should hope an
opportunity would thereby be afforded you of ex
plaining )our condud, in a manner fatibfa&ory to
the public and yourfelf.
1 am, fir,
With esteem and regard,
Your most obedient servant,
G. WASHINGTON.
Major-General Arthor St. Clair.
Sir Philadelphia, April 7, 1752.
J HAVE the honor to receive vour letter
of the 4th instant.
Although I ws very desirous, fir, to hold the
commillion of major-general until the enquiry by
the committee of the House of Reprefentativ*
Ihould be over, /or the reasons I afligned, and
which you are pleased to think have some weight,
âyet the necelhty of the officer being ai,pointed
who is to command the troops, in order 10 his re
pairing to the frontiers, is certainly pre/ling, and
ought to silence with me every wi/h of a mere per
sonal nature : I do, therefore, fir, now formally
rehgn the appointment of major-general.
1 have never, fir, entertained a doubt that an
enquiry into the caufrs of the failure of the late
expedition, whether directed particularly to my
conduit, or to that connected with other cause =
that may have operated in whatever way it might
be conducted, would not prove honorable to me,
and fatis/aftory to the public, as far as ] was con
cerned with it ; but setting, as I do, a due value
upon the public opinion, and desirous not to lose
that place in the esteem of the virtuous and intel
ligent ot my fellow-citizens which 1 have long
held, you will not wonder that, under exi/ting cir
cumirances, a degree of anxiety, not only that
there Ihould be an enquiry, but that every thine
capable of being misconstrued, ftould be avoided
on my part. 1 will own to you, fir, that the de
hre of honejl fame has ever been the ftrongelt pac
tion in my brealt ; 1 have thought that 1 had me
rited it,â-and it is all that 1 have to compeAfate
tor the facrifice of a very independent situation,
and the bed years of my life devoted to the public
service, and the faithful application of my talents,
luch as they were, in every situation in which 1
have been placed, with a zeal bordering upon en
thufiajm. I trull, fir, 1 /hall ttill enjoy it, while
thole who hive attempted to disturb it, will be
forgotten, or remembeied with indignation,â and
in their bofonjs, if they have feeling, sensations
may a rife something similar to what Milton has
delcri bed to have seized upon Satan when he dif
cov6red our firft parents in Paradise.
With every sentiment of refpecft and duty,
1 have the honor to be, fir,
Your most obedient servant,
T , â. , , , ARTHUR St. CLAIR,
