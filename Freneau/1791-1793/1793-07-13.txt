The Blanks, it is well I'ad been
frfr a'confiderable time thought unworthy
t'ne benefits of education and learning, an.!
if is equally known that in Philadelphia the
prejudice that feenred the too reedy adop

off, that liberal eflablifhments liave been
founded for the education of negro chil
dren, and that many who are now arrived
at vears of maturity have witnefTed the be
nefits to be derived from thet'e institutions.
It however has always happened that the

less refined dilquifitions, than they had ge
nerally heard from the clerpyiren, to

idea, together with a deli re of eftablifliinp

would secure a happy religious interconrfe

truth, may vie with those of any other
feft whatever. To tiiis creed all who are
.i<Un\tted'. are. supposed to ftibferibe. but
with reflect to those who do not think pro

among any ot' the pre-existing feftr, of

tiie Africans have acreed to. which o:>lig

It appears tnen that the plea which. ( :ne

nated with the negroes themfeFves .and
thit the actions of their benevolent ftHo\>
citizens (who are now ftigniatifed with
'.he opprobrious epithet of an aristocratic
unto) were <rnly to second and affiCt them,
in the pitrfait of t'.je objects, which they
chemfeives tirlt contemplated.
But I suppose we ihail be told here, that
ivith whomever it may have originated it
tends to make dlftinflions inconfiltent with
â¢epnbfieamfm Itisfaid that an argument
;hat proves too much proves nothing at all:
it' this nature is the reasoning of the True
American. Would it not,if admitted, prove

Let me conclude with a word of advice
:o the "True American." If he writes for
:he purpose of informing the minds of his
'ellow citizens, let him remember, that ca
umny againlt well ifitentioned individuals,
rid vile mifrrprefentations of fa"rs, are not
the proper modes of aceomplilhing so dr
lirable a pt-.rpofe. If he is merely seized
with the cetcoethes fcriber, â¢7, sltho it is not
to be discouraged, let liirn employ his per
on better arid inthecarfe of truth.
If he willies to lupprfTs the "rank weeds

to the foil where fhev have taken root.

worthy, or incrpable, of conducting a re

requelf him to read over attentively the

AS the prefjnt is a period when opinions
, fhotiUi â¢ lie collected ; as a citiz'cn, 1
conceive myfelf called upon tofuhnntmy
sentiments orieverv point, wlrch, it is pro
bable, will hprpafter be decided up m y
the people. , The prefeiit licuation of the
United States, is, to be Cure, extremely
critical. On .one hand we have :i solemn
treaty toftilfill, which teems with noble
and generous, obligations. On the other,
we are-jenloufly watched left wefaould leap
thebovfe.v.iries of ourduty. If we neglect
the.hiltillment of the former, our national
credit, our ail tliat is valuable, will be
blasted with ignominy,and we will declare
otirfelves enemies to ih extension ofli-
If we are impartially friendly to
all the powers, we prefer diffimulatioti arc'
meannefs-togratitude : %ve will prove our
selves friends to despots and foes to free
dom, This is our alternative : let reason,
juflice, 3Â»d policy dictate our choice.
Mvrcb has been said, (with propriety too)
refpefting the Preftderu's late fo'otreign
edit.'. So much, that it is now rendered
alrnofl; nr. 1 'fcefiary to enlarge upon it.
But, as 1 have I rggeiled, this is the time to
eftima'e ffinions.
In giving my opinion on a matter of this
nature I would willingly cfcspe the op
probrium of both parties. ButitiÂ«fo ve
ry difiirukto fleer in the current of popu
lar opinion with fuceefs, that in the entfet.
I despair o(my iortune ; rnd anjlenfiblc of
the danger my barque is liable to in fitch a
violent torrent. But partly convinced that
candour still retains its fuverrignty in the
United Stute'J and that free opinion is the
"narn fprifcg of republicanism, I flatter ray
elf. that :.le following attempt to concili
Â»te the jarring voices of the citizens, will be.
f not eireitnal, the forerunner of one, that
will convince lis all of the purity ofihe
Prefident'o pacific intentions.
In roy opinion. the difputc (hnuld have
erminatcil on the appearance of the Pre
sent's explanation contained in his an-
Twer to the citizens of Salem. But by the
iye, I am far from thinking him juftifiable
n ijTtiing 3 proclamation which would re
quire Â» frparate explanation, or which
would ,e admit of any dispute on the
sppii'caji n $>sot y words contained in it;.

Brurtcd in plain and intelligibly terms-
They should never be so ambiguous as to
admit of mifcofertrciilion or evafron : and

and .politic .the thing may be, it is certain
never to operate eS'cdtualiy.
Wilhing always to preserve tire due fe
"petV for Â®urfirft magiflrate. I mufl never
theless acknou ledge that iiis use of seve
ral words is ftrange,new,and unprecedent
ed ;â  and I can afl'ure him, that his uncom
mon use of thele words, was the only
source from which the fnbfequent torrent
nfinveftive sprung. He surely Smew vei â 
well,- that the people of the United States
felt with gratitude, their obligations to
France; and that they wa'ched for an op
portunity to make a generous return. He
knew that as soon as Great Britain declar
ed herfelf at-war with Fiance. Americans
would recur to thejr treaties and eflablifh
a partial neutrality : yet,
this T.confcioiifnefi, he lias liegleified any
mention of our treaties. I will not fay lie
wllhed to inipDfe a proclamation' on us
which might be conllrurd as the whim
of every one thought proper; but I mull
ron'els, hi's late explanation, has made a
fimilzrimprelEon on my mind. Yet on the
whole. lince our judgments are to be
cuided nore by the intention than the
aftiotlr. of him we judge, I can fafely be
lieve, he did ret intend to advile us to a
neglcft of our contracts : and this I.hepe
will fuorily be the opinion of all. and-the
PreiiJent will be re-pofll'fied of the elleem
of every citizen.
I mull here observe, that I cannot think
[he President outreached his duty in de
claring u* in a (late of neutrality, confident
with our treaties ; because it is his doty to
preserve the peace, and, until a declaration
us war by Congress, the fSates are at peace,
and l>e bad a right to declare them so.

Mr. Freneau,
r HAVE been one of the most forXunoto
*â  adventurers in the iojtery of politics, and
set I do. not enjoy tile happiness 1 ail
icipatfd. My cafe is this. Not pofiVflWl
â¢>f great wealth, and craving an imÂ«iÂ«i<ity
f in tiie government ttith S"ierofii
:ion to make a fortune. My w hole ioul
was devoted to that obieft. Money ivai
never out of my thoughts by day, and I
ireaint of it by flight. J boggled at no
>rviliry, ik> drudgery, pub.ic or private,
hat might forward my design. With the
"miles ot 1 fortune and the help of friends,
I fticcecded beyond my hopes. Previous
to the introduction of the funding fjllem,
[ got hold of a clue that in the labyrinths
of that bufirefs was worth tome r.o Itfs
:han forty thousand dollars. The Afliimp
tion was near making ine as rich as Croe
sus; never were letter plans laid, or exe
cuted by abler members of the craft: but
nur profits were fatlly frittered down by
"one untoward accidents. Perhaps I may
be induced, feme day or other,to entertain'
the public Â«ith the curious hiflory cC them.
My iVi afe of the enterprize ad.ded, notwith
flaviding, five and twenty thousand dollars
to my flock in (peculation. When the bank
came on, you mpy be fnre J did not fail to
play mv part both behind awl before the
fceiies. For certain reafbns, Ido not
now fay how iruuh I made by well timed,
operation?, in the cxcliffive fix per cents,
afterwards in the iticlu'five Mrte per cer.is y
& then in that notable and delectable com
inodity, seJtiP. It is equally cftdlrfs io
riefcend into forne Jnbfeqncnt trnp/adiotis,
flill converted with the bank, which time
may explain.* Suffice it to lay. in one v. ord*
that I am now what I resolved to beârich
& yet, as I observed above. I am not happy-
Don't imagine, however,that my disappoint
ment proceed? from any remorse at the
ways and means whereby I have acenm
plilt.cd my purpose. Thanks to my stars,
I feel nothing of, that kind, having catt-off
all such vulgar prejudices as fait "as I got
acquainted with the world, and rose to a
higher sphere in it.âNo, fir. my wretched
ness flows from quite another source. I
fear, from what has got abroad, ami the

The Briton is fnperior to the American,
ind the American is inferior to the Briton,
a id yet they are equal, and the Briton
ihali govern the American.
The Briton, while here, is commanded
to obey the American, and yet the Ameri
can ought to obey the Briton,
And yet they ought not both to be ohe
dient, but only one to be obedient. For
there is one dominion nominal of the
\meiican, and another dominion real of
the Briton.
And yet there are not two dominions,
but only out dominion.
For, like as we are compelled by the
Bririfh Confiiintion Book to acknowledge.
â  that jabjelis inuft fubniit themselves to
their monarchs, and be obedient to them
in all things :
So are we forbid by our federal execu

y our treaty with Fra ice, or to pay re
gard to what it ent'orceth.
The American was rrc ited for the Bri
ton. and the Briton for the American.
And yet the American {hall he a slave to
the Briton., and the Briton the tyrant of
the American.
And Britons are of three denominations,
and yet only of one foul, nature, and sub
(iflency.
The Iriftiman, o;"irfinitejnipi;dencp.
The Scotchman, of cunning nvoft inferu

And the Englifliman, of impertinence
altogether insupportable :
The only true and honorable gentlemen
of this our blefl. d country.

It is.furthermorc necefljry that every

For'he true faith is. that we bePeve

Fallible in its rfjJublii an nature, and in

The mariners in the harbor of the Cape,
being provoked with the insults whiiji the

o'clock in the evening ; the mariners were
2,500 i 1 number, Trie mulattoes, fearful
of being overcome, retired to the prison of
the city, named Jeole, and reieafed more
than 1200 negro and mulatto prisoners,
chiefly taken among the insurgents, and a
great part of whom had been in irons more
than fix months ; the fame free niulattoes
armed immediately the negro (laves of the

all the white people they met ; the (ire

The negroes set tire, the fame evening, to

the city, through the Foflerte. The 23d
the engagements were more obdinate, and
more considerable. They fay, that this
fame evening all the whites who had been
sheltered in the barracks, where they had
been conducted, were unmercifully mur
dered by order of the chiefs of the bri
gands ; neither women or children were
spared ; several parts of the city were laid
in ashes ; the fame day a number of whites,
who ran towards the harbor to escape the

F.xtraS of a letter from a gentleman in
Connecticut to his friend in this city
dated May e6, 1793.
" I refpeft the French, I glory in the re
volution which they have accomplished, 1
consider their cause as the caflfe of human
nature, of the world, of God ; I think they
killed Louis the XVJ. without law ; but
1 am glad lie is dead, and I wilh it were
polfible, by bne thrust of the exterminating \
sword to extirpate every king, and every
sign of 1 oyalty throughout the world ; with
the sole exception of the great, good and
unfortunate Stauiflaus of Poland. The
general sentiment of thisftate, and of New
Kngland, is in favour of France ; and the
general belief js, that the French will tri
umph."
On Monday evening, recording to ad
journment, met at the eoffee house a num
ber of merchants of thh city, to take mea
Cures into consideration for preventing the
failing of the French armed brig Little
Democrat. A' committee was appointed to
wait on the governor, to inform him, from
proofs in their power, that the said brig
was ar'ied here on a cruize againd fotue
of the powers now at war with trance,
and requefling her detention, as being fitted
out contrary to the proclamation ct the
Preiident 6f the United States. The go
vernor and heads of departments allured
the cosimittee of every exertion in their
power, and the secretary of (late informed
that the brig would not fail till the return
of the Proficient from Maiint Vernon, who
was looked for 0:1 Wednesday the 10th.
The meeting then unanimously agreed,
to set on loot, amongst the citizens at large,
whose .families and property appeared to
be menaced, afubfeription, to raise 6000
dollars, through the medium of the banks,
to be placed in the governor's hands, for
the defence of the p, rt; under an expec
tation, that the legifliture at iheir next
fellion, would provide for the reimburse- j
ment.
A little reflection on the melancholy
events which have lately-drenched in
blood the flreets of Cape Franceis, will
give rife to much uneasiness for the fate of
the convoyed fleet which left that place 011
the 24th lilt.
If" a rt/.ewi; taken of general Galbavid'i
conduct, it mud appear inexcul'able: How
could a recourse to arms polfibly terminate
his difference with the commitTioners ?â
What motive could have actuated a man
in blowing up the flame of a civil war,
when a pei fonal injury only was the pre
text ? An appeal to the (ovcreign power
of the French nation was the only poflibie
means of terminating the dispute. Can
general Galbaud, covered with the blood
of thousands of the colonifls, now make
that appeal ? No ; he cannot be able
even to find an excuse for his condufl, if
brought before the tribunal ot the nation.
It is therefore not improbable* that he
(liould, in imitation of Dumourier's cim
duÂ£t, life his influence to deliver as much
of the Meet as in his power, ii*o the hands
of the enemies of ihe republic, and li;s in
fluence with the armed part of the fleet
appears unfortunately great, if their union
in favouring his views againit the Cape are
adverted to. [Gen. Mv.~]

It is not a hazarded conjecture, re
remarks a correspondent, to fay that the
ill treatment ourvell'els have uniformly met
with from British privateers, is in confe
rence of inftrtifiions from their court.

tool to difurganize the army, in his retreat

Indies, or elsewhere ; plundering the pro

the mailers an" crews under pretence of

war on us for. not tamely fuffering our
fclves to he taxed in all cajes wha'Joevcr
by tifurpation of their parliament, they
now menace to make war upon us for in

upon it, Meflieurs Jamaica men, every true
American printer and editor will always
do their duty ; and as they once largely
contributed to the humiliation an.l chas

fucc?fsfu!!y filled. Sli'ch unexposed success I
ojve to the favor of several zealous friends, who
diftingo'lhrd themfelveq in the undertaking.
I think it unffecefory to make any remark* at

soon be enaMrd so pronounce (ertence upon it.
I hope therefore, that tSofe whose circumftancea
