French National Convention.
Wednesday October 5.
Letter from the council of the diftr:Â£l of
Lisle, to the council of the department
of the Northâdated Lisle, October 1.
" Since the departure of the National
Gendarmes, whom we dispatched to you
yederday, the enemy have kept up a hea
vy fire upon the city. They have fired
cold and red hot bails, befxdes bombs,
which have destroyed and set fire to a
number of houses, particularly in the pa
rifli of St. Saviour. Every pofiible af
iiftance has been given to that quarter.
We wiffi here to lileiice the calumniators
of the people, and to show them with
what calmness, tranquility and cotidancy
those of Lille support the inevitable mis
fortunes of the situation in which we are
âIn one place we behold a father who
loft a childâin another, a husband who
has 101 l his wife, and who, without mur
muring, pays a tribute to fuffering nature,
by faying, " Notwithstanding all this, the
villains (hall not have the city." In a
third place people are seen carrying with
them whatever thiy can snatch from the
flames It mud undoubtedly be allowed
that the enemy carry on a villainous war.
They make use of the inhabitants of the
country, and by beating them with their
sabres and Hicks, compel them to work
on their fortifications. If they endeavour
to run away, they (lop them by firing af
ter them. When (hall we be avenged on
these monflers ? It is ten o'clock and the
fire begins to slacken ; the fire in the
night time will be terrible ; the enemy
have changed their batteries, but depend
upon us, we (hall never yield ; 200 hou
feg have been burnt, and 2000 are more
or less damaged."
Lisle Oft. 3, See.
" Citizen President, we beg you to in
form the National Convention, that the
enemy have not ceased, since the 29th of
Sept. to throw into the city a (hower of
bombs and red hot bullets, which have de
ilroyed a great part of our mod beautiful
edifices. Nothing can be more capable of
inspiring courage into the mod timid,
than to fee with what conflancy our fel
low citizens, who are deprived of their
property and habitations, support their
misfortunes. The love of their country
excites their courage, and diipofes them
to resignation. We know, that the na
tional convention, seconded by the execu
tive power, will do every thing they can
to relieve us. Individuals afiift U3 with
their purses and their fortunes, but these
means will soon be exhausted. Hasten
then to give us your aid. We will fuffer
ourlelves to be buried under the ruins of
our walls rather than surrender."
On a proposition made by M. Manuel,
the convention decreed, that the commit
tee of war should immediately concert
with the ministers, and during the present
fitting, devise some decisive means for the
affillance of Lisle.
Letter from Gen. Cuftine to Gen.

Sept. 30. Sic.
" My dear General,
" You know, that, agreeable to the
plan you adopted, I was to attack Spires,
in which there were 4000 Auftrians, or
troops of Mayence, and magazines said
to be of some consequence. I wi(hed to
execute this plan as soon ae the army I

command was organized ; but being pre
vented by bad weather, I took advan
tage of the firll moment it was pofiible
for me to march to collefl my army at
Landau. The roads however, being
spoilt by the rains, rendered my march
very fatiguing, especially that of the bo
dy which I conducted, and which was
deftinedto cut off the retreat ofthe enemy
towards Worms. Having set out at
nine in the evening 011 the 29th it was
two o'clock next afternoon, when I ar
rived at the entrance of those roads which
lead from Spires to Worms and Manheim.
I found the Auftrians drawn up in order
ofbattle before Spires, having on their
right an eminence, which is above the
gate that looks towards Worms, a ravine
before them, and there left extended, a
mong some gardens surrounded with
thick hedges.
'â¢ I did not hesitate a moment to at
tack them in this position, and dire&ing
against their line a heavy fire of artillery,
which protested my own line while for
ming, I marchcd at the fame time upon
their left four battalions, destined to take
poffefiion of the eminence which comman
ded them. They soon determined to re
treat within the walls of the town.â
Having tried for a moment to force the
gate by my cannon, I preferred, when 1
saw the ardour with whi :h the troops
were animated, the making an attempt to
cut them down with their hatchets. Ha
ving proposed this method, it was eager
Iy received, the fire gate being demolilh
ed, and then that of the inner wall, the
Auftrians were repulsed in every quarter:
but taking (helter in houses, in which they
formed port-holes, when our troops were
engaged in the (Ireets, the enemy com
menced a moll terrible fire on them. As
I, however, had taken the precaution to
place at the heads of the columns some
howitzers and eight pounders, I was ena
bled to rally my troops, who were at firft
a little intimidated , and soon afur the
Auftrians thought of nothing but retreat
ing.
"Colonel Houcfiard, who had been
prevented by a great inundation from ap
proaching the banks of the Rhine, has,
however, been able to execute a coinrnif
fion I gave him with the regiment which
he commands, and he has taken 400 pri
soners. I resolved to pursue the enemy
in their retreat, and having come up with
them at the Rhine, they laid down their
arms. When in Spires they amounted to
more than 4000 men, Several colours,
standard, cannon, howitzers, and above
3000 prisoners have been taken in this
expeditionâThe Auftrians loft, beiides,
a great number killed. The magazines,
which we found here are immense.

tails refpetling them. I mull concludc
my letter, for 1 am ready to drop down
with hunger and fatigue, having been
twenty-two hours on horse back, and the
troops as long under arms.
" I cannot conclude this dispatch, with
out commending the firmnefs of the soldi
ers. the paticnce with which they suppor
ted the fatigues of so terrible a march, the
discipline they observed, and the bravery
they displayed. I art? extremely happy
in having this day seen the cause of liber

that I have been able to moderate and
check the fury of the soldiers. 1 have
the fatisfaftion of faying that in a town,
taken by dorm, and where a firing took
place in all the streets, a single aÂ£tion has
not been committed which I need blush
at.
"It gives me great happiness, my
dear general, after having found an op
portunity of inspiring my troops with con
fidence, aftet having carried away the
magazines of the enemy, and destroyed
their forces, to be able to join you, in or

Letter from the Mmijler of IVar.
Paris, Oftobcr 6, 1792.
Citizen PresidentâThe convention
will, doubtless, with pleasure fee, by co
pies of and extracts from, the letters of
gen. Cuftine, details of his ufeful and
glorious expedition; but you will learn,
not without pain, that the good conduct
of the troops, has been ltai'ned for a mo
ment by emiflaries mixed among the brave
defenders of their country, who have at
tempted, with a momentary success, to
introduce among them a system of plun
der and irregularity, which appears to be
the lad resource, or rather the lalt conspi
racy of the enemies of liberty and equali
ty âI hope the convention will approve
the severe but necessary condu& of gen.
Culline. The severity which he has em
ployed he thought necessary for the glory
of the French republic.
" Gen. Dumouiier informs me by letter
of some military operations, and that to
morrow he means to fend a fnfficient
force to drive the enemy from the de
partment of the North,
" I have this moment received Intelli
gence that, on a proposal made by gen.
Lamorlier, in conjunction with the mu

of earth permitted 11s to place our batte

flickered from their cannon. Our batte
ries were erected under the shelter of this
natural parapet, and the column destined
to support them was luckily covered by
a riling ground. We loft, in consequence
very few men ; we had 20 killed and
wounded, among whom were two of
ficers. With regard to the magazines, I
have not yet been able to learn the state
of them. Four hundred waggons have
set out to day for Landau, and it does not

" Citizen PrefidentâT have the ho
nor to inform the convention of a dispo

take refpeftlng the officers of the Aus
trian ticops, and those of the empire,
who laid down their arms on the 30th of
September. .:fter employing the usual
formalities, and having made them sign
an obligation not toierve till they are ex

The reception which they met with on
their entrance into France will doubtless
change in the minds of these soldiers the
unfavourable impressions which had been
given them refpeding us. These impres

at Landau, they refufed the refrefhments
which were brought to them. Permit
me to embrace this opportunity of alfuring
the national convention, that my refpett
for the laws, and the representatives of
the people, is equal to the zeal and nrm

difference arose, from a requisition on the
part of the Frcnth to punish filch of the
Genevefe magistrates, as had been active
in drawing Swiss troops into the republic
of Geneva, contrary to an existing treaty
which was disregarded. Gen. Montef

" The removal of the money sent to the
army has made a deep impreflion on the

When the citizens saw the savings of the
great Frederic rolled towards the banks of
the Rhine, they (lied tears. It is supposed
that twenty-four millions have been sent
off already. Prince Henry, on his return
to Carfbold, said to M. Munckkouzer, that
rj millions had already palled through
JVlerfbourg. The general opinion is, that
the treafurv is exhauftcd. This whim of
the prince deprefies the courage of his fub
jeits,and produces a bad effert in foreign
countries. The declaration of the duke
of Brunfwick is much blamed. Prince
Henry, who detests the duke with all his
heart, does justice however to his abilities;
"but had any one a fin red me." said he,
" that such a manifefto would appear, I
would not have believed it." Profeflbr
Kheftner, at Gottingen, has written a moll
Severe epigram on the part which the king
ofPruftia has taken in this war. The epi

account of one just man who was in it. At
present, a German prince wifhesto destroy
all France, for one crowned fool who is in
it.'
" Hiltory shudders, and tbe German peo
ple call the prince, as they formerly called
Atilla, the scourge of God. It is gene
rally doubted whether this enterprize a
gainst France will have a happy iflue. It
was previously known that Longwy and
Verdun would open their gates. When
the news of the siege of the latter place
arrived here, Count de Schmettau said, â
' they will throw a few bombs into it. as
they did at Longwy, in order that they
may be able to tell us that they took it.'

" Such, Citizen-President, are the news
sent from Berlin to the Pruflian minister,
by a man who was doubtless charged to in
form him refpefting the disposition of that
capital. Such a Source ought not to be
suspected. The different letters which I
have received from Germany, announce
to me that our fuccefTes have, with great
rapidity, given the public opinion a turn fa
vorable to our cause : They prove, above
all, that we are as much indebted to the
conduct as to the courage of our soldiers
for that esteem which we inspire into the

will serve to throw a little reliraint upon
the combination of courts.

The President announced a letter from
General Dumourier, in which he requeu

" The conflitutional laws which you are
about to frame, will form the balls of the
happiness and fraternity of nations. This
war will be the last, and tyrants and pri

calculations, will be the fo'e viflims in this
struggle of arbitrary power against reason.
The army, which the confidence of the
nation entrufled to my command, have de
served well of their country. Reduced,
when I joined them, on the 28th of August,
to 17,000 men, ami disorganized by trai
tors, whom punifliment and shame every
where pursue, they were neither intimida
ted by the number, discipline, threats, bar
barity, norfirtt fuccefFes of Bo,oco fateliites

Argon were the Thermopylx, where this
handful of soldiers of liberty made a re
fpeftnble refinance, for fifteen days, to that
formidable army. More fortunate than
the Spartans, we were supported by two
I armies, animated by the fame spirit, whom
i we joined at the impregnable camp of St.
Meqehouid. The enemy, in despair, wifil
ed to attempt an attack, which adds new
victory to the military career of my col
league and friend Kellerman.
" In the camp of St. Menehouid, the sol
diers of liberty displayed other military
virtues, without which courage even may
be hurtfulâconfidence in their chief, obe
dience, patience, and perseverance. That
part of the republic conliflsofa dry foil,
deflitute of wood and water. The Ger
mans will remember it; their impure blood
will perhaps fertilize these barren plains,
which are now drenched with it. The
season was uncommonly rainy and cold :
our soldiers were badly cloathed ; were
destitute of straw to lye upon ; had no co
vering, and remained sometimes two days
without bread, because the position of the
enemy obliged our convoys to rake a long
circuit, by cross-roads, which are very bad
at all seasons, and which were then spoilt
by the long rains; for I mult do justice to
the purveyors of provisions and forage,
who, notwithstanding all the obfhicles of
bad roads, wet weather, and the secret
movements which I was obliged to < on
ceal from them, supplied us with abun
dance, as far as was possible ; and I am
happy in declaring, that we are indebted
to their care for tiie good health of the sol
diers. [Applaufes.'J I never heard them
murmur. Songs and joy would have made
one take this formidable camp for one of
those camps of pleasure, where the luxury
of kings formerly embodied automata, for
the amusement of their miftrefTes and chil

ported by the hope of conquefl ; their fa
tigues and fufferings have been rewarded;
the enemy have funk under famine, mise

diminished one half, has fled; the roads

" Citizen General,
" THE reception you have met with
from the national convention, will express
to you much better than I can their fatis
faflion with your conduit, and that of
your colleagues, and the opinion they en
tertain of you. Continue to direÂ£t the
courage and zeal of the army; continue
to guide your soldiers, and your brethren
in arms, in the path of honour and of vic
tory ; continue to serve your country with
fidelity, and you will have new claims to
the esteem and gratitude of the republic.
The convention invites you, as well as
your brethren in arms, to the honour of
the fitting."
The general was then introduced into
the hall, together with the officers who
attended him, and deposited his papers 011
the table, as did also Lieutenant General
Morton, his- military decorations.
Lafource, â 11 I move that theconventi
on will request General Dumourier to give
i them Tome information retpectirg the let
i ter of General Dillon."
Prefiiient, â"General, do yen know any
thing of a letter written by General Dillon
i to the Prince of Heffe-Cafl'el ? and do
â  yon know what was the intention of the
; General in writing it ? The National Con
vention expects some information from
; you, as the executive council informed
I them that they hoped you would be able
i to fatisfy them in this refpeÂ£t."
Dumourier, â" I received a copy of that
letter, but I considered it a mere bravado,
and thought it of very little importance,
especially as Dillon,two clays after purfu
e<l the Hessians with the utmost vigour.
I am of opinion, therefore, that it is not
worth notice."
An Adjutant General of Dumourier's
army p'-efented to the convention the firft
standard which the emigrants had displayed
and which the soldiers of liberty had cou
rageously taken from the enemy.
The convention decreed, that this signal
of rebellion, instead of being hung in the
hail as a trophy, (hould be put into the
hands of the common executioner, to be
publicly burnt.

The Leyden Gazette contains an account
of the progress of the Pruflian army on the
14th, 15th, and 16th of September, as pub
lished at Berlin.âThis account, far from
imitating the (tile of the Brussels Gazette,
which never mentions the French troops
but With contempt, expressly fays : That
in the various actions thattook place on the
14th and 15th the Prussian troops were re
pulsed, and (hews, that although they al
ways carried their point in the end, every
inch of ground was warmly disputed. To
this account is subjoined a letter from the
army of General Clairfayf, dated Septem
ber 26th, written in the fame flile, which
makes the loss of the Prnflians, in carry
ing the height before the village of Wal
my 500 men, and that of tile French, at
tempting to defend it, J2CO. The conclu
sion of it fhevvs, that the distress of the
combined armies, has not been exaggerat
ed :â" Since the 17th, we have been un
der the open Iky, without tents or bag
gage. The weather all the while has been
dreadful; conlta.,;: and excellive rains, tem
pefttious winds, and cold uncommonly se
vere for the season. The armies on both
fides have fuffered severely; the latter fea
foil cannot be more unfavorable for tiie
operations of the campaign. According
to all the information we receive, the ene
my is still more diflrefi'ect than we. We
art? in the midll of Champagne Pouilleufe
(the lousy) a country arid <k j:-oorin the ex
treme, unprovidecl-&f every thing ; with
out water, without wood, almofta defart,
and entirely abandoned by the native in
habitants. We mult seek water more
than a league from our camp ; add to this
that the French have taken care to throw
lime into almost all the wells. They make
war with all the resources, not only of the
military art, but of the molt virulent ha
tred. It is not from the ordinary dangers
of a campaign that we mult guard our
selves but from treachery and perils of e
very kind. The transportation of provi
sion is thus rendered uncommonly difficult,
while the army must carry every thing
along with it, the country furnifhing no
thing. Y efterday,the 2jth, the enemy de
liianded'a truce for 24 hours, which was
granted and expires at midnight.
Luxembourg, Oct. 5. Since Monday,
September 24, numbersofFrenchprifoners,
the greater part of them national guards,
have been daily brought in here. A large
body of them was brought hither on the
twenty-ninth from Verdun, and about
100 hundred have arrived to-day. The
greatest part of these poor wretches are
in a molt deplorable situation, having
scarcely Ihoes or (lockings. They were
taken in different Urinal;;.es, which have
not however tended jiibih to advance the
operations of the combined armies. TUe
accounts which we have received from
Verdun are of the lr.oft diftrefllng nature.
The Prussian army has been in want of
bread for several clays ; and what they
have been able to procure by fending to
a great distance 'or it, did not reach the
camp until it had become green and moul
dy
The AuUrian army is in no better con
dition. The country around Verdun is
laid waste, ruined, and become almofta
defart; as it has not leafed to rain for 4
weeks, the roads are deltroyed and impas
sable ; they are belides covered with hun
dreds of dead bodies. By these disasters
the soldiers are difiouragec), and the offi
cers themfelvcs despair of feeing the cam
paign happily terminated.
Such being the situation of affairs, it is
expected that a Congress of ministers from
different powers will be opened here on

ordered lodgings to be prepared for some

count of this Coi'grefs that government has

Letter from General ylnfelm, to the Prefl

Sept. 29, Isfc.
ITIZEN, being uncertain in what
part of Savoy Citizen Montefquiou
may be at present, I think it my duty to
give you immediately an account, that on
the 28th uli. being' employed in making
preparations for palling the Var, I receiv
ed different advices, dating, that the troops
of the king of Sardinia were making dif
pufitions to retire towards Sofpello on the
road to Coni.
" I immediately ordered all the grena
diers of the army, supported by two bri
gades, to make ready for ci offing the Var.
" I placed myfelf at the head of this
column, with which I passed the river, and
advancing with rapidity to the city of
Nice, entered it without resistance. Af
ter establishing my military po(b ; my firfi
care was to fend a body of troops !o at
tack the foi tress of Montalban. I si m
moned the Governor, and threatened hirr
with an escalade, for which I wÂ«s making
preparations. He then lurrendcred pri
lower of war, with the whole garrison, con
fiding of Swiss troopi. I found the artillci)
in excellent condition.
" Our grenadiers at present occupy tliii
poll, which is of the grcateft importance
as it will enable me to maintain u.y pofi
tion in Nice should I be attacked by ;
very superior force, and as it gives me ven
great advantages toget poflefTion ofthe caf
tie of Ville-!'ranche, which I hope to tak<
to-morrow in some way or other : it is de
fended by five pieces of cannon.
" I have found between the Var anc
Nice a great number of cannon, several o
which have been spiked up in such hade
that I think it will be easy to make then
soon fit for use. The enemy had not tim
to carrv away the ammunition belonginj
to these guns. 1 am already provided wit!
a great number of nuifkets, and with am

" Citizens, the Auftrians continue tc
desolate, by their plundering, the rid
country which furroundsthe city of Lisle
the place, however, will never fall intc
their hands. General Labourdonnaye ha*
thrown Teveral reinforcements into it, fc
that at present its defenders amount to al
lead 16,000 men. The citizens difplaj
the greatest courage, and their flcill anÂ®
activity have hitherto prevented the pro
grefs of the flame, occasioned from time
to time by the red hot balls, which the
barbarians who belieged it make use of tc
reduce it to ashes.
" We are now going to set out for thai
place, and shall do every thing in our pow
er to render our presence, which is vvifliec
for there, ufeful to the republic.
" But that our commissioners may b<
as serviceable as possible, it may not per

â which forms the department of the north
â which, above Lisle. is only three quarter:
of a league in breadth, and which in n<
part comprehends the whole of the fron
tiers. A part of the department is in th<
powerof the enemy, and it is through tin
Pas-de-Calais that a communication i<
kept tip between the Head Quarters Ge

The following letter from the commil

on the Bth of October. It is dated St
Menehould, Oftobcr 7.
" Citizensâthe enemy continue thei
retreac towards Stenay, and notwithftand
ing the rapidity of their march, our troop,
incessantly harrafs them. We take grea
numbers of them prisoners every day ; anc
if they had not taken the precaution tc
cause their baggage to file off three day;
beforehand, they would have saved none
of it.
" We know that the miftinderftatiding
between the king of Prussia, the emigrant!
and the Aullrians, is carried to the utmofl
extent. Ths king of Prussia, when he
began his retreat, sent for the cidevanl
Monsieur, and General Clairfayt, anc
iddreffed them as follows: "You have
both deceived me; I will still extricate
you from the bad iituation in which you
jre, but yon will remember me."
" The army of Dumourier is advan.
;ing towards the defiles of Grand Pre, anc
General Kellcrman, who lad night took
jp his quarters at St. Menehould, will fel

General Dumourier has reinforced the ar

men. His advanced guard, 1111
Jer the command of Dillon, is at the dif
:ance of two leagues from Verdun, an J
we expect, that if attacked, it will not
;iold out above two or three days.
The minister at war sent a letter frorr
Gen. Beuernonville, and one from Gen,
Labomdonnaye.
The former was still in pursuit of the
;nemy ; the weather had been dreadfully
33d, and if it Ihould so continue, the ene.
Ny would be obliged to leave their horses ;
Daggage, and artillery in the mud.
The latter dated, that the fire of that
:nemy at Lisle had ceased, and that he
sxpefted they would soon retreat.
The minister at war announced, the
ace-admiral Trugnet, by an energetic
Fummons, had obtained the release of the
French consul at Nice, who had been ar
-efted by order of the Piedmontefe gene
ral.
The fame minister communicated ex
:raÂ£ts of letters from General Labourdon
laye, and General Bournonville. The
Former dated, that the Auftrians had cea-
Fed firing upon Lisle, and wers preparing
:o raise the liege.
Gen. Bournonville's letter is addrefled
to Gen. Dumourier, dated March, Octo
ber 5. The material parts are, " The
weather is very bad ; I have not been able
to make use of my infantry ; they were 38
hours in going two leagues ; they had 110
bread to eat these two days ; we have ta
ken 30 horses from the enemy, two pri
soners, and 121 of their lick.
" I have declined burdening myfell
with so great a plague; and have sent
them to their homes ; if I had heai'kened
to the wish of my volunteers, we Ihould
have buried them ia the mud ; if this dif
order continues raging, the enemy will not
get back either horses, men, or cannon :
they are much in want of the former for
their artillery.
" The king of Prussia and Monsieur
pasTed this way ; the former yesterday, and
the latter the day before, appearing to be
very much frightened. However, the re
treat of the Pruflians is conducted with
the greateil order ; the van-guard passed
Tiern at 12 o'clock lad night, and Grand
Pre at 2 o'clock with sixty carriages full
of their sick, and I let them carry the
plague farther onâbut am in readiness
expe&ing you.

The combined armits under the com
mand of the Duke of Brunfwick, hac
efFe&ed their retreat as far back as Ver
dun. The enemies of the French repub
lie appear to be completely difconcertec
in the obieft of the campaign. They ex
peeled to have been joined by large num
bers of the French, but on the contrary
few or none flocked to their standard
They were promised supplies of provision
from France, and depending upon them
they were for some time in a ftarvinf
condition. The Prufiian magazines havi
been exhausted, &the provisions carried t<
the invading armies proved so unwhoie
some, that sickness and disease were tin
confequencet of using them. This add
ed to incessant rains for many weeks
were the immediate causes of the retreat
The French army under the command o
Dumourier and Kellerman harrafled thei
rear and captured numbers of their sol
diers, and larger quantities of baggage anc
(lore?. The siege of Lisle and of Thion
ville were certainly abandoned. Th<
late king and queen of France were pri
foners, but it was imagined would not be
brought to trial, or injured. The city ol
Paris and the whole nation was in a flats
of tranquility. The national convention
conducted themselves with propriety, and
pofTefTed the confidence of the people, and
110 doubt exilled that the new republic
would be eftablilhed, notwithflanding the
opposition of the allied powers.
General Cultine, of the northern French
army had invaded the Imperial territories,
and reduced Spiers, Worms, and several
other places, and taken large magazines
of provisions. General Montefquiou had
completed the conquell of Savoy.
The unfortunate La Fayette was a clofc
confined and cruelly treated prisoner at
Wefel, in the Prulfian territories.
The Empress of Russia was marching
an army of 30,000 men to join the ene

Spaniards would also unite with them in a
