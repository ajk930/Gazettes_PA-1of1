LET T E R
From Thomas Paine to the people of France.
" Paris, Sept. 25.
" Fir ft year of the Republic.
" Fellow Ciiixent !
"T RECEIVE, with affeÂ£iion?.te grati-
A tude, the honour which the late na
tional aflemb!) has conferred upon me, by
adopting me a citizen of France : ant'
the additional honour of being eledled by
my fellow citizens a member of the nati
onal convention. Happily imprefTed, ;u
I am, by those teftimonit3 of refptÂ£l to
wards meat an individual, I feel my feli
city incrcafed by feeing the barrier broken
down that divided patriotism by spots ol
earth, and limited citizerifhip to the foil,
like vegetation.
" Had those honours been conferred in
an hour of national tranquility, they would
have afforded no other means of (hewing
my affection, than to have accepted and
enjoyed them , but they come accompani
ed with circumltances that give me the
honourable opportunity of commencing
my citizenlhip in the stormy hour of diffi
culties. I come not to enjoy repose.â
Convinced that the cause of France is the
cause of all mankind, and that as liberty
cannot be purchased by a w(h, 1 gladly
{hare with you the dangers and honour-.
ntcefTiry to success.
" I am well aware, that the moment
cf any great change, such as 1 hat accom
plifhed o 1 the loth of August, i 3 una
voidably the moment of terror and con
/ufion. The mind highly agitated by
hope, suspicion and apprentfnfion, conti
nues without reft till the change be ac
com.phfhed. Bu; let us now look calm
ly and confidently forward, and success i:
certain. It is .no longer the paltry
cause of kings, or of this, or of that in
dividual, that C' 'â¢ France and her armies
into action. It is the great C3ufe of all.
It is the eftablifrsment of a new asra, that
shall blot defpotilm f.om the earth, and
tix on the lasting principles of peace and
citizenlhip, the great republic of man.
" It has been my fate to have borne a
{hare in the commencement and complete
eftablilhment of one revolution (I mean
the revolution of America.) The success
and cventÂ» of that revolution are encou
raging to us. The prufperity and hap
piness that have since flowed to that coun
try, have amply rewarded her for all the
hardfliips (he endured, and for all the
dangers foe encountercJ.
" The principles on which that revolu
tion began, have extended themselves to
Europe: and on over ruling providence
is regenerating the old world by the prin
ciples of the new. Thediftance of Ame
rica fjom all the other parts of the globe,
did not admit of her carrying of those
principles beyond her own situation. It i:
to the peculiar honour of France, that flit
now raises the (tandard of liberty for all
nations; and in fighting her own battles,
contends for the rights of all mankind.
" The fame spirit of fortitude that in
sured success to America will insure it to
France, for it is impossible to conqlier a
nation determined to be free ! The mili
tary circumstances that now unite them
selves to France, are such as the despots o;
the earth know nothing of, and can form
no calculation upon. Tkey know not
what it is to fight against a nation.â
They have only been accustomed to make
war against each other ; and they know
from system and pra&ice, how to calcu
late the probable success of despot againfl
defpot,and here their knowledge aad theii
experience ends.
" But in a contest like the present, .
new and boundless variety of circumstan
ces arise, that derange all such customary
calculations. When a whole nation acts
as an army, the despot knows not the
ester.; of .the power against which he con
tends. New armies rife against him with
the necessity of the moment. It ;s then
that the difficulties of an invading enemy

multiply, as in the former cafe they dirri
r.ifhed, and he finds them at their height
when he expe&ed them to end,
" The only war that has any similari
ty of circumllanccs with the piefent L
;!:e late revolution war in America. On
her part, as it now is in France, it was a
war of the whole nation There it was
that the enemy, by beginning to conquer,
put himfelf in a condition of being con
quercd. His firH victories prepared him
tor defeat. He advanced till he could
not retreat and found him.elf in the miiill
of a nation of armies.
"Were it now to be propoftd to the
Auftrians and Pniffians to efeort their
i'.ito the middle of France, and t!u*re lcaw
them to make the most of such a situation,
tl; y would fee too much into the dan
gers of it to accept the olfer; and the
lame daman's would altenu them, cor.
ihey arrive there by any other means. â
Where then is the military policy of then
attempting to obtain, that whict
:hey would refufe by choice But tr
'eafon with deipots is throning realoi
iway. The belt of arguments is a vigour
â us preparation.
" Man is ever a stranger to the way
ay whfibh providence regulates the orde:
if things. The interference of Ejrcijrt
iefpots may serve to introduce into tluii
>wo eiifljved countries the principles the)
:ome to oppose. Liberty and equality
ire bl-.IS rgs too great to be the inheri
ance of France alone. It is honour tc
:ier to be the firft champion : and she may
row fay to her enemies, with a mighty
â¢â nice, "O! y? Auftrians 1 nd ye Prut
liana ! ye who turn your bay >nets againll
is; it is for you, it is for all Europe, il
s for all mankind, and not for France a
one, that Hie raife3 the (landard ofliber
:y and equality !"
" The public cause has hitherto fuf
rered from the contradictions contained
n the conllitution of the former conftitu
;nt aflembly. Those contradictions hive
Served to divide the opinions of individu
als at home, and to sbfeure the great prin.
riples of the revolution in other countries.
But when those contradictions shall be
removed, and the coullitution be made
conformable to the declaration of rights :
when the bagatelles of Monarch, Royalty.
Regency, and Hereditary succession, shall
be exposed, with all their absurdities, a
new ray of light will be thrown over the
world and the revolution will derive new
strength bv being univerfallv understood.
" The scene that now opens itlelf to
France, extends far beyond the boundaries
of her own dominions. Every nation is
becoming her colleague, and everv court is
becoming her enemy It is now the cause
of all nations againil the cause of all courts.
The terrors that despotism felt, clandei
tinely begot a confederation of despots :
and their attack upon France is produced
by their fean at home.
" In entering on this great scene, great
er than any nation has yet been called to
ast in, let us fay to the agitated mind,
be calm. Let us punish by inftru&ing,
rather than by revenge. Let us begin
the new <era by a greatness of friendfhip,
and hail the approach of union and fucceis.

" 1 have the honour of fending back tc
liis fcrene highness the Landgrave o
Hefle CafTel, Lieutenant Lindau. He
may judge by the declaration I have madt
to that officer, that the French nation
always great and always generous, know,
how to appreciate a noble action, and e
deems bravery even in its enemies
Â« I embrace this opportunity of prcfeti
ting to your serene highness some reflec

humanity. Youcannot deny that a nati
on, taken collectively, has a right to give
itfelf whatever form of government it may
think proper,, and that, consequently, its
will can be opposed by that of no indivi
dual. Free and absolutely independent
forever, the French nation has. resumed its
rights, and wishes to change the form
of its government. Such, in a few words,
is the sum of whajt is palling in France.
His serene highness of HeiTe Caflel has
brought into that country a body of
troops ; as a prince he is facrificing his
fubjeds to a cause in which he has no in
terell ; and as a soldier he mult be fenli
ble of the situation in which he now isâ
It is dangerous : he is surrounded ; and
I propote to him to set out to morrow in
order to return to his own country, and
to evacuate the French territories. I rtiall
procure him the means of palling in fafe
ty near the F>ench armies, which are now
in pofleflioti of several points near wlicti
he mull direst his march XJoud
This proposal is made in a candid manner
and I require a formal and explicit an
swer. The French republic can excuse
an error, but it knows how to avenge
the .ip.vafton and pillage of its territo
ries.

Letter from the Commijfioutsr; of the Con
vention,Jent to the army of the Alps.
" Chamberry, Oft. 6, 1792.
" Citizens, our colleagues, the Pied
montefe, liiice our tirft dilpatches, have
made no efforts to recover from thLt flats
ofihipor into which they were thrown bj
the appearance of our troops in Savoy.â
We have received intelligence that the ar
my on the Var, under the command o]
General Anfelme, has fubjefled tht
country of Nice with the fame rapidity]
and we have learned from the courier ol
Piedmont, intercepted a few days ago, thai
aristocracy, notwithstanding the arrival oi
7000 Austrian troops, trembles even at Tu
rin. We have viiited the camp at Mont
inelian, which is under the command ol
General Rolli, and found the difpoiition ol
it excellent. Good order prevails in it;
not a (ingle citizen has made any com
plaint ; property of every kind is refpeit
ed; patriotism alone animates the brave
soldiers of liberty, and the (houts of Vim
la 7iation ! Vive la Republique t have beer
unanimous. The General presented to u;
two volunteers who have deserved well
of their country, by conducing the column:
to the bottom of the redoubts of the abys
ses of Myans, which they had gone and re
connoitered the evening before with equal
skill and intrepidity. We thought it our
duty to reward their zeal, by admitting
them to be officers at the head of the camp,
and we here consecrate their names to
public gratitude. One of them, called
Clermont, is a sergeant major in the com
pany of Avin; and the other, Ageron, is
a sergeant in that of Imbert, both belong
ing to the fifth battalion of the volunteers
of Ifere. The troops set out next morn
ing to march againlt Aiguebelle, and we
think we can assure you that the Taran
taife and la Maurienne are completely eva
cuated.
We have so much the more reason to
congratulate ourselves on the conduit ol
the French troops, as the General not ex
pecting such a feeble resistance could not
provide himfelfwith provisions, which might
have enabled him to pursue the enemy.â
Thefoldiers of liberty experienced at fir ft
some scarcity, either from the fear or dif
aifeition of the inhabitants, who, in some
cantons, even refufed to supply them with
provisions for money. They did not, how
ever, forget the cause for which they were
combating ; they patiently looked to the
wifdomofthe General for those necelfa
ries which they flood in need of, whilst the
Piedmontefe, flying like plunderers, rava
ged every thing in their way, cutting even
the vine (hoots, without any other view
than that of laying waste the country.
"We fliall without delay transmit tc
you the process-verbal of those devaluati
ons, as well as an account of the urgent
wants of those unhappy provinces, torn by
the hands of their pretended defenders.
The molt absurd tales, industriously circu
lated againlt the French republicans, had
intimidated the peaceful Savoyards ; but
if the mild behaviour of our troops has dis
sipated the clouds, it has also encouraged
the malecontents to carry on their private
intrigues. To put a flop to all falfe inli
nuations, we have thought proper to ilfue
a proclamation, in the name of the Nation
al Convention, a copy of which we now
fend you. We hope you will approve out
zeal, and support our principles.
" Our attention, as well as that of Gen.
Montefquiou, is fixed upon Geneva. You
know that without any provocation on the
part of France, 1600 Swiss have entered
that city ; that our resident has retired
from it; and that the provisions destined
for our ariny have been carried away by
the inhabitants. If that city isfree, it will
do us juflice ; if it is not free, it belongs to
the French to restore to its inhabitants the
power of thinking and of ailing.
" General Montefquiou has made pow
erful dispositions. He is at present at Car
rogue with a large body of troops, and to- ]
morrow we intend to join him.
" We learnt on our arrival at Cham
berry, that General Moirtefqujou had dif
iniiled the battalions of volunteer grena
diers who had joined his army, and that
four of the five battallions, sent to him by
the department of Gard, were on their re
turn home to their habitations. This mea
sure appeared to us diltreffing at a time
when France, surrounded by enemies, had
need of the greatest efforts from all good
citizens. As the General did not think
that he ought to comply with our repeated
solicitations, these generous defenders ot
their country were thrown into the great
ell consternation when they learnt this in
telligence. They requelt that they may
be employed at Paris, Soillons, or any o
ther place, where their zeal and their
courage may be of service to the republic.
The electoral body then aflembled, and
exprell'ed a delire that the wifii of these ci
tizen-soldiers might be complied with.â
The council-general of the department
join with the electoral body and the volun
teers, in begging that the convention will
point ou.t a poll for these four battali
ons."
Honorable mention was ordered to be
made of the zeal of these citizens, and the
committee of war was ordered to give in
a report on the bulinefs.
A letter was read from the commillion
ers of the executive power, dated Valen
ciennes, October 10. The letter ltatcd,
that the commillioners had palled a censure
on the battalions who had behaved so ill at
St. Amand, and that to prevent the bad ef
fects of flich an example, they had thought
proper to ilfue a proclamation. They :i!fo
informed the convention chat the Auftri
aus, after breaking up the liege of Lisle,
seemed to be advancing againlt Valenci
ennes by Quievrain, and that their pioneers
were already arrived in a neighbouring
village.

When the promise of half pay to the late
army, from a variety of circuimtances, svaÂ»
commutedân appeared from an aggre
gate calculation, that tlie auny had ful
lered, 011 tlieir monthly wages, a diminu
tion ot 66 1-3 per cent lor lix years 011
their ltate and continental payments ; this
was relinqunlied on a prefuiaption of its
being their proportion with ether public
creditors. Admitting the iiaif pay agree
ably to the resolution of Congrels of the
22d ol March, 1753, vizâ * And whereas
Congrels are delirous as well of gratifying
the reasonable expectations ot' the officers
ol the a my, as 01 removing all objections
which may exilt 111 any part of the United
States to the principle of half-pay eltab
lillinient, for which tlie faith of the United
States has been pledgedâperluaded that
those objections can only arise from the
nature ot the compensation, not from any
indifpolition to coinpenfate tliofe whose
fervlees, facrifices, and fufferings have so
Jull a title to the approbation and rewaro
<>t their country : Therefore, relolved,
that luch officers as are now in service, and
i!;all continue to the end of the war, lhall
be entitled to recover the amount of five
years lull pay, in money or lecurities on
interelt at 6 per cent per annum, as Con
grels lhall think moll convenient, instead of
halt-pay proinifed for life by the resolution
of October 21, 1780.' The officers u idl
ing for tranquility, received the commuta
tion in lieu of half pay, and the lion-com
millioned officers and privates received one
year's lull pay as a gratuity in final fettlc
ments that was anticipated to relieve the
necellities that naturally would followlrom
their impaired habits and constitutions.â
But Congress and the several states in all
their public and private tranfaftions, elti
mated those ceruficates at 2/6 in the pound,
whereby the reasonable expectations of
their officers and soldiers were difappointcd.
Therefore to resume the half pay, would
be oidy the firft contract, and to give cre
dit to th'evalue of the commutation, agree
able to the funding fylteui, would place
the public debt in the fame situation as if
the intermediate transactions had not ta
ken place.
Nodoubtit was the intent ofCongrefs
then to do juiticeâfor on a motion of Mr.
Hamilton, seconded by Mr. Wiljoti, the
2d of May, 1783â" Resolved, that Con
gress confidently rely for an immediate and
efficacious attention to the present requisi
tion upon the difpolition ot their conttitu
euts, not only to do juitice to those brave
men who have fuffered and facrificed so
much in the cause of their country, and
whose diltrefles muff be extreme ihould
they be sent from the field without the
payment of a part of their well earned
duesâbut also to enable Congress to main
tain that faith and reputation of the Uni
ted States, both which are ferioully con
cealed in relieving the necellities of a me
ritorious army, and fulfilling the public
llipuiation."
In consequence of the foregoing resolu
tions, Mr. Morris illiied his bills at fix
months credit, in June, July, and August,
to the amount of four months pay : these
bills were discounted by H L
and others sent to camp for the purpose,
at 30 per cent, below par; and also re
ceived for merchandize at the moderate
profit of 200 per cent, on the Iterling cost ;
this, however, was a seasonable relief, the
army having been so long accustomed to
running in debt for clothes, and other con
tingencies, and felling the ltate payments
at 300 per cent, discount. However, I
only beg leave to recite a paragraph in his
Excellency General Wafiiing ton's letter
to the President of Congress, dated ls Te\v
burg, March 18, 1783.
" And here I humbly conceive it is alto
gether unnecefi'ary (while I am pleading
the cause of an army which have done and
fullered more than any other army ever
did in defence of the rights and liberties of
human nature) to expatiate en their
claims to the most ample compensation for
their meritorious services, because they
are known to the world, and because tho'
the topics are inexhaustible, enough has
been said on the fubjeft."
A CONTINENTAL SOLDIER.
I Dec. 31, 1792.
For the National Gazette.
ALL efforts towards monarchy and
aristocracy being rendered abortive by va
rious circumstances, we now find the for
mer advocates of titular diftinftions de
claring that they only heretofore recom
mended such tilings inject, and never once
entertained a [erious thought that distinc
tions of this kind could be countenanced
by any conftit'Jtion in the United St3tes
while the people remain what they are.
II is aKb denied by th ejecret advocates for
American monarchy, â¢' that any king
makingparty exifls of the United States."
I ins is probably true : the current of
popular opinion is become so strong againtt
every idea, intimation, and attempt of that
nature, that the advocates and planners of
!ljch schemes no longer dare venture
b. oad with their proportions for giving the
government a twist towards royalty, the
eager though somewhat concealed object
of a well known faction for at least four
years by-past, it not from the very hour of
the conclusion of the war. They now lie
\n petto, have ha v ied in their horns, and
are completely astounded at the ungra
cious profpeft before them ; and are even
ailuming a tone ol language directly op
polite to what they formerly held they
may therefore be conlidered as extinÂ£t,
and their venom almost asharmlefs as that
ot the old tories of 1776.
Materials are now colleÂ£Kng, and there
will, at a day not very far diltant, be pub
lillied, a curious hiltory of the efforts that
were made three or four years ago to in
troduce Titles and Hereditary Orders into
the United States. It was presumed that
the popular entlnifiafm, roused as it was
on a certain memorable occasion, would
unfufpe&edly establish the much wifh'd for
powers and dignities, civil and ecc!e!:alti
calâAt this period mitres and maces were
firft imported ; and laughable, indeed, it
is to recollea when the births of the -well
born were regularly published in a certain
gazette (the editor of which, it is said, had
the promise ol being made Equerry cf the
Ilablei, in cafe the titular system had suc
ceeded) and the people in a fair way of
being taught to look up to the offspring of
their public servants as to a set of superior
beings, young matters and miftrelfes, to
whom thev were hereafter to pay court,
cap-ill-hand, and bow the knee of servile
obeisance,
Alcho' tile good sense of the people soon
saw thro',and despised those stupid attempts
at aping the nonsense and villainy of Eu
ropean courts, yet the wiley abettors of
those tinsel dignities and diftinftions were
not ealily dilcouraged. No endeavor has
been omitted, ever lilice the period above
mentioned, to poison and infatuate the
minds of the people and to prejudice thein
against that honest simplicity in the ad
ministration oi government, which ought
ever to predominate in an American re
public. The scene of affairs, however, in
France, has operated as a perpetual dif
courageraent to such high-minded innova
tors among!! us ; and the total downfall
of royalty and nobility in that country (as
has been expressed on another occalion)
will, like an early froft, utterly blast and
annihilate the germ of this poisonous weed
in America.
It is curious to observe, how the ideas
of your American monarchy-mongers have
flowed altogether in corrupted European
channels. Forinftanceâln order to fix a
precedent, "forhim that isto come after,"
the birth-day of a popular or meritorious
character cannot pals without his being
pestered with long fplny-foot odes on that
occalion. Intense is offered that is dis
dained to be fnuffedâand which yet is of
fered, and even attempted to be puffed up
thenoftrils, infpiteof the mod marked con
tempt. To prevent expreflions of disgust
in future, poet-laureats are now talked of
for this purpose, who, as being supposed
men of ability, would be able to cook up
the incense in such a manner as to make
it at least tolerable to the olfa&ory nerves.
But who ever heard of a poet-laureat in a
plain, frugal republic ?âlt is an office al
together monarchical, and when eltablifh
ed, ought (if right took place) to be re
jected with the other paraphernalia, trap
pings, and tinsel ;->f exploded royalty. If,
however, it fliould be thought neceflary,
in future, to continue regularly in this
country, the praflice of birth-day-ode
making, a proper chara"er ought in due
time to be pitched on for the purpose
That lie fliould be a sycophant and a toad
eater. and wholly devoted to men in of
fice, would be the firft great requisite. In
other refpeits, he fhcv.ld be or.e who hasturned off an epic poc .i or two, and who,
if required, en write as mmy as the re
nowned Blackra ire without faintingâand
such, to our honor be it (aid, we can find
in abundance by turning our views a little
eafiward. If ;is happens to have a good
deal of the courtier in his composition, lb
much the better, for however the mere
poet in any country may have rsafou to
reflect upon the world for not having
searched out or properly rewarded poeti
cal merit, there is no doubt but the court
fycophant, un:la.iy government, will al
ways find himfelf amply rewarded for the
servile adulation he pays to men of weal*
minds and ambitious expeÂ£iations.

[Â»f the approach of the forces of liberty,
pn the 20th of October, the following letter
From the commiflioners to the central ar
my, dated, Camp of Vaudoncourt, Odt. 18,
|nd iigned by the commiflioners of the Na
tional Convention, was read to that body :
" Thedivifion of the army commanded
by-General Keilerman, arrived yeiterday,
at the Camp of Vaudoncourt : General
Valence, who commands the other divi
lion, advanced through the sorest of Man
gienne, and pulhed his van-guard as far
as Pillon, which he found occupied by the
enemy. He was obliged to bring up his
cannon against this post, and then he soon
jot mailer of it.
The Duke of Brunfwick and General
Kalkreuth sent in that day a trumpeter
with an aijl-de-camp, to demand a perfon
il conference with General Keilerman ;
they teftifiqd a desire to accommodate
matters, but General Keilerman adhering
(trittly to the intentions of the national
convention, answered that he could en
ter into no conference whatever, as long
as the Pruflian army should be on the ter
ritory of the French republic; that the
re-surrender of Longvvy was a prelimina
ry without which he could enter into no
engagements. The Duke of Brunfwick
offered to evacuate Longwy and to give
the place up on the twenty-sixth. Keller
man judgiug that'he wanted four daysmore
to arrive with his army before that place
on account of the roads being broke so
much,infifted on having the place evacuat
ed the twenty-second of this month.
After this conference, General Valence
was charged with the regulation of the
articles of capitulation. V.'e fend in
closed an authenticated copy thereof, and
you will judge yourfelf of the advanta

commissioners will thank them for their
courage and perfeverence. We beg our

As there is some appearance of a peace
with the Indians, it is hoped that Congress
will totally annihilate the office of a SE
CRETARY AT WAR. For thegreateft
security for a lasting peace is, that no fucli
appointment be made.
The probability of a peace \\ 3th the In
dians, ihews evidently that it is in the
power of a few individuals to make war
or peace in that quarter, as may suit their
convenience and inureft. The investiga
tion of the late failure, it is probable, Has
led thefeJetters on to think more ferioul! y
011 this bulinefs, knowing that when the
people are awake .they will never fuffer
millions of dollars to be expended for the
emoluments of any individuals, however
dignified in office or pompous in deport
ment.
The rejection of a late bill "in toto,*'
for further compensation, evinces that a
majority of Congress begin to be atten
tive to the observations in the public pa
pers, and are not for lavishing roo large a
proportion of the public funds on favor
ites. It is expected that the rejeÂ£tion of
this bill will originate a motion for redu
cing the J'alaries of public ofii ters.
LONDON, oÂ£t. 12.
The Duke of Biunfwick has obviously
no other design than to repafs the M'eufe
by the way of Grand Pre, and quit the
French frontiers. In his impatience to
make good his retreat, he fuffers excessive
ly from the army under Bournonvilleâ
Scarcely an hour passes that this general
does not make some attack, and bring off
a part of their cavalry or their ft ores. De
serters are continually arriving within the
French lines, and that they inform them
that the fe.ilon for the invaders, is from 5
o'clock in the morning till noon. The
road they march along is found strewed
with poor dying wretches who have fallen
victims to the ravages of disease and fa
mine.
It is at Grand Pre, that the three combi
ned bodies of troops under Dur. ouricr,
Bournonville, and Duval, mean to bid them
farewell. The difpol-.tions taken by the
former are kept profoundly secret : but
he speaks with confidence of cutting off
the army of Brunfwick,and his troops have
received the orders to march with all the
alacrity of men confident of terminating
the war in one deciiive action. On the 3d
instant, to the number of 120,00 c, they
marched from St. Menehould for this pur
pose. The Avant guard had advan
cing under Bournonville, frompoft to poll:,
as the combined armies retreated, front
the 30th of September.
While these great events are pafling, the
troops who were at H iffenibourg, largely
reinforced, are ordered into the Biifgavv.
They will pass the Rhine with a numerous
artillery, between lort Lou s and Stras
bourg, and immediately .attack the emi
grants and other enemies on the right of
that river.
The circles of the empire, by their last
decisions, have resolved to keep their troops
in garrison, while Prussia and Austria pass
their winter with tranquility in Metz, Thi
onville, and Rheims. They h av e no fort
of presentiment of what has happened, to
render that at least doubtful.
Before the disastrous entry of the allied
armies into Champagne, the French were
taught to dread the immense and believed
invinciblc cavalry of Pruiiia.âWhat is be
come of it? Thehorfe is the tendereft of
all animals; the inclemency of a marftiy
foil and incessant rains, have killed them by
hundreds. Cuftine has burnt the forage
necessary for their support, and the French
Huflars bring away numbers of them daily.
Vitry is the market for their sale : and
there the peasants come to buyâand be
speak the preference of such as the light
troops may acquire in their excursions.
Tiius, what with the negleff of fuccosirs,
imprudence in their feeding, the determi
ned enterprize of the enemy, and yet more
than all these, of the inclemency of the
season ; this perhaps unequalled assem
blage of the fineft troops in Europe, is for
ced into the disgrace of a retreat, before
armies they have too lightly derided, and
leaders they seem injudiciously to have de
spised.

M. Treillard called the attention of the
Aflembly to the two battalions of Federates
of Paris, who in the mod barbarous man
ner had tarnilhed the honor of the French
nation, by maflacring, without mercy, and
in defiance of all law, theunfortunate Prus
sians, who had abandoned the stand
ards of despotism to serve under those
of liberty. He requested, that the vil
lains, who had been guilty of this atrocity,
(hould be given up to all the severity ol
the law. " The law," said he, "on this
fubjeft is explicit: Against such the penal
code pronounces the featence of death. I
I move, therefore, that the criminals shall
be conduced to some town which you may
point out ; that a court-martial ill all im
mediately be formed to try them ; and
that no application (hall be admitted to the
tribunal of appeal."
This proposal met with no opposition,
but the committee of war was charged to
give in their ideas on this fubjedl during
the fitting.
One of the Secretaries proclaimed the
names of the members who are to compose
the committee of conditution. These
were Seyes, Thomas Paine, Petion, Brif
fot, Veignini!:!, Grnfonne, Barrere, Dan
toÂ», Condorcet. The deputies were Bar

Fauchet, Lavcoomtrie.

half pad seven the next morning. Hear

gence that the enemy weie not far diftunt.
Our troops relinking then their former po

noon the French army, whom they found
:o amount to about 17,000 men, by a dif
:harge of tVir cannon. The cannonade
ivas kept up with great spirit on both fjder,.
The enemies artillery was much more nil
merous ; but as our troops were drawn up
only two men deep, while the French ad
vanced in columns, their lof3 mult have
been conliderable. At three o'clock the
garrifbit retired to the town through the
different gates, and the firing was continu
ed in the flreets with so much vivacity
that the infantry of Maymce eight times
repulsed the French cavalry. Notwith
ftandingthis brave refiflance, our troop:
were obliged to give way before the enemy,
who were much superior in number, and to
retire through the gate called Wiefethor.

the diflance of a league from Spires- The
French pursued them thither with theii

baggage,fhould be given up to the enemy
that the officers should be fuffered to re

that the soldiers should not be stripped.â
After these ftipulationswere agreed to, tin
garrison was brought back to the town
