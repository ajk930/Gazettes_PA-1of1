Report on MancjactWes.
(Continued,)
THE continuance of bounties on ma
nufa&ures long eftabhfhed, muftalmoft
alwavs be of questionable policy : Be
cause a presumption would arise in
every such cafe, that there were natu
ral and inherent impediments to fuc
cess. But in new undertakings the)
are as juftifiable, as they are ofrentime 1
necessary.
There is a degree of prejudice againfl
bounties from an appearance of giving
away the public money, without an im
mediate confideratioiij and from a fup
poiition, that they serve to enrich par
ticular classes, at the expence of th<
community.
But neither of thef: sources of dislike
â will bear a serious examination. There
is no purpose to which public inone)
can be more beneficially applied, thar
to the acquisition of a new and ulefu
branch of iaduftry ; no confideratior
wore valuable than a permanent, addi
tion to the general stock of produitivt
labor.
As to tbe second source of objeÂ£liori
it equally lies against other modes o
encouragement which are admitted tc
'be eligible. As ofren as a duty upon ;
foreign article makes an addition to it:
price, it causes an extra ex pence to the
community, for the benefit of the do
meftic manufacturer. A bounty doe:
no more. But it is the intereftof tbe
society in each cafe to submit to a tcm
porary expence, which is more thai
compensated, by an encreafe of indul
try and wealth, by an augmentation o
resources and independence ; and b\
the circumitance of eventual cheap
ness, which has been noticed in ano
titer pUci. â
It wou}d deserve attent ; on, however
in the employment of this ipeciesofen
courageroent in the United States, as;
icafon for moderating the degree of ii
in the instances in which it might bf
deemed eligible, that the great diftanct
of this country from Europe impofei
very h;avy charges on all the fabric:
which are brought from thence, a
mounting from 15 to 30 per cent, cr
their value, according to their bulk.
A question has been made concerning
the conthtutional right of the govern
ment of the United States to apply thi:
species of encouragement, but there 1:
certainly no good fouudation for fuc!
a question. The national legifiatun
has express authority "To lay ant
collect taxes, duties, imposts, and ex
cifes, to pay the debts and provide so:
the comvion defence and general welfare,'
with no other qualifications than tha
'â  all duties, imposts, and exciles, fhal
be uniform throughout the United States
that no capitation or other direst ta>
shall be laid unless in proportion t<
numbers ascertained by acenfusor enu
meration taken on the principles pre
scribed in the constitution, and tha
no tax or duty shall be laid on article:
exported from any state."
These three qualifications excepted
the power to raffe money is plenary an<
tndefnite; and the objects to which i
may be appropriated are no less compre
henfive, than the payment of the pub
lie debts and the providing for the com
mon defence and general welfare. The
terms " general welfare" were doubt]ef'
intended to fignify more than was ex
pressed or imported in tliofe which pre
ceded ; otherwise numerous exigencies
incident to the affairs of a nation wouk
have been left without a provision.
The phrase is as comprehenlive as an\
that could have been used ; because it
was not fit that the constitutional au
thority of the union, to appropriate it;
revenues should have been reftrifted
within narrower limits than the " gene
ral welfare and because this neceTa
rily embraces a vast variety of particu
lars, which are susceptible neither oi
fpecification nor of definition,
T H U R S D A Y, i 79 2.
It is therefore of necessity !,-ft to the
â¢ lifcretion .of the national legislature.
0 pronounce, up<in the objetts, which
concern the genet al welfare, and foi
which, t'tidcif thjt dcteription, an ap

rality cf the phraie in queflion, whicl
seems to be admiitlblc. is thisâTha

No o'ojeftion ought to arise to thi
-011 (trufition from a fjppdfition that i
.vill imply a power !o do whatever el it
hould appear to Congrcfs conducivt
0 the general welfare. A power to ap

A-hich is granted too in express ttrms
-vould not carry a power to do am
nh'cr thing,. not authorised in the con
1 itution, eitlier expressly or by fair im
jlication.
V. Premiums.
These are of a nature allied to boun
ies, though distinguishable from then
n lome important features.
Bounties are applicable to the whoh
juantity of an article produced or ma
mfaftured, or exported, and involve ;
orrefpondent expencc Premium
erve to reward some particular excel
er.ee or fuperioritv, lome extraordina
v - : tion or fkiil, and are difpcnlif
>n!y m a 1: i;;TI number of cases : Bu'
heir effect is to flimulate general ef
011âcontrived so as to be Doth hono
â ary and lucrative, they address them
elves to different passions ; toucEin;
,iie chords as well of emulation as o:
nfrercft.âThey are accordingly a very
economical mean of exciting tiie enter
prileof a whole community.
1 here arc various societies in differ
;r.t countries, whole object is the dif
penfationof premiums for the encou
ragement of agriculture, arts, manufac
ture, and commerce ; and though they are
for the moil part voluntary ali'ociations
with comparatively slender finds, theii
utility has been immense. Much ha<
been done by this mean in Great-Bri
tain : Scotland in particular owes mate
rially to it a prodigious amelioration bi
condition. PYom a similar eftablifh
merit in the United States, supplied anc:
supported by the government of the
union, vast benefits might reafonabl)
le expeftcd.âSome further ideas or
this head, shall accordingly be submit
ted, in the conclusion of this report.
VI. The exemption of thi materials' o J
nanufaElures from duty.
1 he policy of that exemption as a ge
neral ride, particularly in reference it
new establishments, is obvious. It car
hardly ever be advisable to add the oh
(tru&ions of fifcal burthens to the difii
culties which naturally embarrats a nev\
manufacture ; and where it is mature<
and in condition to become an obje&o
revenue, it is generally speaking bettei
that the fabric, than the material, fhouk
be the fubjeft of taxation.âldeas o:
proportion between the quantum o:
the tax and the value of the article, car
be more easily adjusted in the formei
than in the latter cafe. An argument
for exemptions of this kind in the Uni
ted States, is to be derived from the
pra&ice, as far as their necefiities have
permitted, of those nations whom wc
are to meet as competitors in our own
and in foreign markets.
1 here are however exceptions to it :
of which some examples will be given
under the next head.

found adviiable (o extend it to some
other casesâOs a nature, bearing (ome

proper to continue.

It has already fc.ecn observed as age

"urnifhes an argument for the obfer

t to some other articles.
V 111. The encouragement ofnerv invert
'ions and discoveries, at home, and of ih
introduction into the United States cj fuel
is may have been made in other countries.
Particularly those which relate to machinery,
This is among the moftufeful ane
unexceptionable of the aids which car
>e given to manufactures. The ufua
neans of that encouragement are pecu
-liary rewards, and, for a time, exclu
r ive privileges. The firft must be em
ployed, according to the occasion, anc
the utility of the invention, or discove
ry. For the last, so far as respects " au
thors and inventors," provision has beer
made by law. But it is defirabl? in re
gard to improvements and secrets of ex
traordinary value, to be able to extend
the fame benefit to introducers, as well
as authors and inventors; a policy
which has been r practifed with advan
tage in other countries. Here, howe
ver, as in some other ca r es, there is
caule to regret, that the competency of
the authority of the national govern
ment to the good, which might ho done,
is not withe it a question. Many aids
might be given to industry ; many in
tf r j ia I improvements of primary magni
tude might be promoted, by an authori
ty operating throughout the union,
which cannot he cilected, as well, if at
.ill, by an au-.horitv confined within the
limirs of a fmgle l>'ate.
But if the legiijature of the Union
cannot do ail the good that might be
wifiied. it is at leal! ddireable, that .ill
may be done which is practicable.

foreign improvements, though lei's
â¢ fficacioufly than might be accoinplifh
d with more adequate authority,' will
orin a part of the plan intended to be
Ã¼bmitted m the cloÂ£e of this leport.
It is customary with manufacturinp
nations to prohibit, under severe penai->
;ias, the exportation of implements and
machines, which they have either in
dented or improved. There are alrea
dy objects for a similar regulation in the
United States; and others may be ex
pected to occur from time to time. The
idoption of it seems to be dictated by
he principle of reciprocity. Greater
iberality in such respects might better
comport with the general spirit of the
country ; but a felfilh and exclusive po
uicy in other quarters will not always
permit the free indulgence of a spirit,
which would place us upon an unequal
footing. As far as prohibitions tend
to prevent foreign competitors from
teriSTng-the benertTS~Of the improve
ments made at home, they tend to en
-lcale the advantages of those by whom
hey may have been introduced ; and
operate as an encouragement to exer
:ion.
IX, Judicious regulations for the irfpec~
iion of manufallured commodities.
This is not among the least important
i)fthe means, by which the prosperity
d! manufactures may be promoted. It is
indeed in many cases one of the most
:lfential. Contributing to prevent
frauds upon consumers at home,
portersto foreign countries'âto improve
:he quality and prelerve the character
ihe national manufactures, it cannot
fail to aid the expeditious and advanta
geous lale of them, and to serve as a
against fuCcefsful competition
from other quarters. The reputation
d 1 the flour and lumber of some
and of the potash of others, has been
sflablifhed by an attention to this point.
A.nd the like good name might be pro
:ured for those articles whereloever pro
duced, by a judicious and uniform fyf
em of infpeftion, throughout the ports
)f the United States. A like system
night also be extended with advantage
0 other commodities.
X. The facilitating of pecuniary remit
'ances from place to placeâ
is a point of considerable moment to
irade in general, and to manufattures in
particular ; by rendering more easy the
purchase of raw materials and provifi
3ns, and the payment for manufa&ured
supplies. A general circulation of
bank paper, which is to be expected
from the institution lately eftablilhed
will be a moll valuable mean to this
nd. But much good would also ac
-1 rue from some additional provisions.
refpefting inland bills of exchange. If
those drawn in one ftatepayable in ano
ther were made negotiable, every where,
and interest and damages allowed in
cafe of protest, it would greatly promote
negociations between the citizens of
different states, by rendering them more
Secure; and, with it the convenience
and advantage of the merchants aacl

THE proceedings of the national as
f-mbly in oppOsition to flrict republi

intention that the confutation shall Iran:,
or fall with Jhe revolution. They have
elfo determined seriously to restore tr

the article concerning the right o

deference to the wish of the t ing, whon
the nation is willing to consider the de

the j-i-neral pacification abroad ; aiu

ing with some of their fparigles of roy
f,l,yâ[he king seems to carry oh th
iol's of absolute authority with a cole
indifference; and from hence it ma\
be inferred, that women, in general
find it much harder to part .with powe

on such occasions may be admitted a
a tefl of their feelings. Previous to tht

than some ha.ve imagined. The rca
object of this particular conference was.
a reciprocal renunciation of any pre
fences to the crown of Poland, in cafe
the elcftor should die without leaving
male issue ; which pretences, if the;
fnould take effcfl, would have some in
fluence in causing a war, to prelervi
the balance of power in Europe. A?
to the French affairs, the presence oi
M. d'Artois and M. de Calonne are i
fufficient proof that they have not beer
palled over in silence. Advices fron
Dresden positively assure us, that a re
l'olution has palled to attempt nothing
at present by force of arms with a view
to overturn the new conflitution, full
consideration having been taken on tht
uncertainty of the event, the difficulty
of nroceeding on such an expedition
and the danger that would inevitably
attend even success itfelf.

The restoration of the' Jews to the

unexampled effrontery, in daring to
proceed in direst opposition to certain
ancient prophecies relative to the Jew

if these prophecies be authentic, they
are to be understood in a figurative ra

Thus, the promile to the Jews that
they should be restored to their original
country after a certain number of ages
spent in wandering up and down the
world, means in all probability, not that
they shall be sent back to the miferablc

A French Gentlemen, who came paffen?erm

The day following, one of the mula'toes, be

flurof defence, and immediately dispatched
several deputies to know the rcafon of the me
naced hoflility. Thev received for answer, that

nit. as the deputies %vere returning to their Quar

hem. The uuilatto-s returned the fire, and a

:wcen the white and mulatto troops. âTbelorm-
â r prevailed, and took pofT'fiion of the Polls of

t fire to everv thing in their power, and a drcad

â na'ed, as the richefl and mod capital quarter of

everal Indian Chiefs have lately bÂ»en to I .ondon
â:>nd reports of their returning with sentiments
infiicndiy to the United States [perhaps more

o this, that the mod hoflile tribes are near ihe
neighborhood of theweflern pods, withheld from
ashy Biitain, ar.d that they have lately fought
with a degree'of regularity unknown before to
Indians, tlu surmise appears probable, that they
have not only received supplies but afliOance
from that quarter.

From the Albany. Gazette..
Bv a gentleman from the Gencfee country, we
earn, th :t previous to his departure, the Indiar
â fount of the defeat of the American arms or
he Miami, had reached there, both from De
roit and Buff aloe creek, and is by them (fated a:
"ollows: That they killed 1200 Americans, anc
00k 7'pieces of cannonâfoo oxen, and a grea
lumber of hcrfes, but no prisoner that theii
ofs was only 56 warriors kilted.
Our informant adds, that the number of In
lians in the battle was not exactly afeertained
nit supposed to have been between 3 and 40CO
ind this opinion is confirmed bv a gcntlem-n whe
vas at Detroit when the Indians left it on theii
a ay to the Miamiâ who fays, they were so very
numerous as to create serious alarm in that garri
i'on, and that every precaution was taken for it!
afetyâas the Indians were exceedingly irritatec
vith the British government for not having coun
enanced them in their warfare wi-:i the Unitec
itatesâThat the Indian army was compcfed o:
ome from aim oft every tribe from the Miami tc
Lake Miche- an, Michellimachanac, and proba
cy even to the MiflifippiâThat it was com
nanded by one of the Miflafago Indians, whe
lad Keen in the British service, in the late war
hat he planned and conducted the attack, whicl
.vas even contrary to the opinion of a majori \
>f the chiefsâand, that alier the Americans be
jan their retreat, he told the Indians tfiey hac
billed enough, and that it was proper ro giv(
v/er the pursuit, and return and enjoy the beot\
hey had takenâThat their account of the corn
mencement of the atlion and its continuance
agrees with Gen. St. Clair's letter to the fecreta
ry at war.
The'principal part of the above "informatior
3ur informant had from the FarmerVÃrotber, ar
Indian of that name, an intelligent person, anc
Chief of the. Senecas.
Our informant further adds, that Capt. Brand
is friendly to the United States, particularly iotc
ihe inhabitants of the Genefec settlements: Tha
the unfriendly Indians have (ent him a mcflage
:hat as they have conquered the Americans (a;
they term it) they intend paying h>m and the Se
necas a vilit, on account of their not having
joined them in the war.
We are told, the Seneca tribe of Indians are
ibleio furnifh 305 of the firft rate warriors, and
-ire. friendly to the United States, as are all the
other tribes of the Six Nations âwho would tuir
Dutwith aljcrity to join an American army against
the Weftem Indians.

It is said, when the deputation of WeOcrn Jn-
Jiiins. waited on the Gov. Gen. of Canada, Lord
Dorchester, la(l spring, that Capt. Joseph Brandt
appeared among them, and a&ed as their spea
ker, in their conferencesâthat his Lordship took
ro inform Capt. Joseph, that as he was
an officer in the British service, it became neces
sary for him to lay alide the Indiun dress and al
fume that of his corps ; for, if he infiOed on re
raining the former, his pay as a British capta'n
mull cease, and his name be struck off f:om the
lift of officers.âlt is adtled, the captain wiftlv
â¡referred the British pay and uniform, to the f:o

The fymptomsof attention to the improvement
of inland navigation, which have lately appeared
in some quarters, mult fill with pleafur'e every
brealt waim~d with a true zeal for the
of the country. These examples, it is to be ho
ped, will stimulate the exertions of the government
and citizens of every Hate. There can certainly
fce no ohjeCt, more worthy of the cares of the lo
cal alrniniftrations ; and it were to be wished,
that there was no doubt of the power of the natio
nal government to lend its direCt aid, on a com
prehensive plan. This is one of those improve
ments, which could be prolecuted with more effi
cacy by the whole, than by any part or parts of
the Union. There are cases in which the general
jnfereft will be in danger to be facrificed to the
coliifion of some iuppofed local interests. Jea
)oufies,'in matters of this kind, are apt to exist,
as th*>y are apt to be erroneous.
The following remarks are fafficifently judicious
and pertinent to deserve a literal q-iotation :
il Good roads, canals and navigable rivers, by di-
Ttiiniihing the expcnce of carriage, put the remctt
farts of a country more nearly upon a level with
those. in the neighborhood of the town. They
arc uton that account the greatest of all improve
ments. They encourage the cultivation of the re
mote, which must always be the most extensive
circle of the country. They are advantageous tc
the town, by breaking d vvn the monopoly ol
the country in its neighborhood. They a e
advantageous even to that part of the country.
Though they introduce some rival commodities
into the old market, thry open many new markets
to its produce. Monopoly besides is a great enem"
to good management, which can never be univer
sally eftsblifhed, but in confequencc of shat free
and universal competition, which forces every bo
dy to have recourse to it for the fake of felf de
fence. It is not more than fifty years ago that
font? of the counties in the neighborhood of London
petitioned the parliament again ft the extension oj
the turn-pike roads, into the remoter counties. Those
remoter counties, they pretended, from the cheapness
(J labor, 70 uld be to fe I thei" grajs and com
cheaper in the London market, than themfelves> ana
they ivould thereby reduce their rents and ruin their
cultivation. Their rents however have risen,
and their cultivation has been improved, fincc
that time."
Specimens of a spirit, similar to that which go
verr.ed the counties herefpoken of present them
selves too frequently, to the eye of an impartial
observer, and render it a wish of patriotism that the
body in this country, in whose councils a local or
partial spirit is least likely to predominate, were
at liberty to pursue and promote the general inter
est, in those instances, in which there might be
danger of the interference of such a spirit.
The foregoing are the principal of the means,
by which the growth of manufactures is ordinari
ly promoted. It is, however, not merely necefia
ry, that the mcafures of government, which have
a direCt view to manufactures, Ihould be calcula
te a Gift and protect them, but that those which
tioly collaterally affeCt them, in the general course
of the administration, should be guarded from any
peculiar tendency to injure them.
There are certain fpe.cies of taxes, which are apt
to be opprefiive to different parts of the communi
ty, and among other ill effeCts have a very un
friendly aspect towards manufactures. All poll or
capitation taxes are of this nature. They either
proceed, according to a fixed rate, which operates
unequally, and injurioully to the industrious poor;
or they vest a discretion in certain officers, to make
estimates and affefYments' which are necelTa*ily
vague, conjectural and liable to abuse. They
ought therefore to be abftaincd from, in all but
cases ofdiftreffing emergency.
All such taxes (including all taxes on qccupa
tions) which proceed according to the amount of
capital supposed to be employed in a business, or
of profits Juppofed to be made in it are unavoidably
hurtful to indu(try. It is in vain, that the evil
may be endeavored to be mitigated by leaving it,
in the firft instance, in the option of the party to be
taxed, to c'eclare the amount of his capital or profits.
Men engaged in any trade or business have com
monly weighty reasons to avoid aifclofures, which
would expose, with any thing like accuracy, the
real state of their affairs. They most frequently
find it better to rifle oppreflion, than to avail them
selves of so inconvenient a refuge. And the con
sequence is, that they often fufrer oppression.
When the disclosure too, if made, is not defini
tive, but controulable by the discretion, or in other
words, by. the paflions and prejudices of the reve
nue officers, it is not only an ineffectual protec
tion, but the pofiibiiity of its being so is an addi
tional reason for not resorting to it.
Allowing to the public officers the most equita
ble dispositions j yet where they are to exercise a
discretion, without certain data, they cannot fail
to be often'mifled bv appearances. The quantity
of business, which seems to be going on, is, in a
vast number of cases, a very deceitful criterion of
the profits which are made ; yet it is perhaps the
best they can have, and it is the one, on which
they will most naturally rely. A business there
fore whicft may rather require aid, from the go
vernment, than be in a capacity to be contributory
to it, may find itfelf crushed by the mistaken con
jectures of the assessors of taxes.
Arbitrary taxes, under which denomination are
compTifed aH those, that leave the quantum of the
tax, to be raised on each person, to the discretion of
certain officers, are as contrary to the genius of
liberty as to the maxims of industry. In this
light, they have been viewed by the most judicious
observers on government; who have bestowed upon
them the severest epithets of reprobation j as con
stituting one of the worst features usually to be
met w.ih in the praCUce of dfefpotiS governments.
it is ccrtain at leafl, that such taxes aie parti
cularly inimical to the success of manufacturing
industry, and ought carefully to be avoided by go
verumenr, which defifes to promote it.
The great copiousness of thei\rbjeCfc of this re
port has insensibly led to a more lengthy prelimi
nary d i feu Hi on, thah was originally contemplated,
or intendeds It appeared proper to inveftigatc
rinc ples, to consider objections, and to endeavor
to eftablifn the utility of the thing proposed to bt,
encouraged } previous to a fpccifrcation of the ob
jects which might occur, as meriting or repairing,
encouragment, and of the measures, which might
be proper, in respeCt to each. The firft purpofi
having been fulfilled, it remains to pursue the se
cond.
In the seleCtion of objeCts, five
seem entitled to particular attention: The ca
pacity of the country to furni/h the raw material â
the degree in which the natu.e of the manufac
ture admits of a substitute for manual labor in ma
ciiineryârthe facility of executionâthe extenfive
r.els or the uses, to which the article can beappli
â  dâits fublerviency to other interells, particular
ly the great one of national defence. There are
however objects, to which these circumrtances
are little applicable, whiclf for some special rea
fjns, may have a.claim to encouragement.
A deflgnation of the principal raw material of
which cach manufacture is composed will fcrvc
to introduce the remarks upon ir. â As, in th
firft place
IRON.
The manufactures of this articic arc entitled to
pre-eminent rankâNone are more efieritial In
their kinds, nor so extensive in their uses. They
confiitute in whoic or in part the implements or
the materials, or both, of almofl every ulefui occu
pation. Their iiiil'romentality is every where con*
fpicuous.
It is foitunate for the United States that they
have peculiar advantages for deriving the fulL be
nefits of this mo ft valuable material, and they have
every motive to. improve it, with systematic c?re.
it is to be found in various parts of the United
Siates, in great abundance and of almofl every
quality } and fuel the chief instrument in manu
facturing it, is both cheap and plenty.âThis par
ticularly applies to charcoal ; but there are pro
ductive coal mines already in operation, and strong
indications, that the material is to be found in
abundance, in a variety of other places.
The enquiries to which thefubjeCl of this report
i as led have been answered, with proofs, that ma
nufactories of iron, though generally underflood to
be extenfjvCj are far more 10 than is commonly lupÂ»
[>ofed. The kinds, in which the greatest progress
has been have been mentioned in another
placc, and need not be repeated j but there is lit
tle doubt that every other kind, with due cultiva
tion, will rapidly succeed. it is worthy of remark
that several of the particular trades, of which it is
the basis, are capable of being carried on without
the aid of large capitals.
iron works have very greatly encieafed in the
United States, and are profecutea with mueh more
advantage than formerly. The average price "be
fore the revolution was about sixty-sour dollars
per ton, atprefentit is about eighty ; a rife which
is chiefly to be attributed to the encreafe of manu
factures of the material.
The ft:li further extenSon and multiplication
of such manufactures will have the double effett
of promoting the extraction of the metal itfeif, and
of converting it to a greater number of profitable
purposes.
Those manufactures too unite in a greater de
gree, than almost any othertf, the several requi
sites, which have been mentioned, as proper to be
consulted in the fcieclion of oDjeCtff.
The only further encouragement of manufacto
ries of this the propriety of which may pe
Confidsred as unqueitionable, I'eems to be an en
creafe of the duties on foreign rival commodities.
Steel is a branch which has already made a
considerable progress, and it is ascertained that
some new enterprises, on a more extensive kale,
have been lately let on foot. The facility of car
rying it to an extent, which will Jupply all inter
nal demand, and furnifh a considerable lurplus for
exportation cannot be doubted. The duty upon
the importation of this article, which is at present
feventy-five cent? per cwt. mav, it is conceived,
be fafely and advantageoully extended to ico
cents. It is defirahle, by decisive arrangements,
to second the efforts, which arc making in so very
valuable a branch.
The United States already in a great measure
supply themselves with nails and spikes. They
are able, and ought certainly to do it entirely. The
firft and most laborious operation, in this manu
facture, is performed by water-mill r . j and of the
persons afterwards employed a great proportion arc
oovs, whose eari) habits of indufrry are of impor
tance to the community, to the present support
of their families, and to their own future com
fort. It is not less curious than true, that in cer
tain parts of the country, the making of nails is
an occasional family manufacture.
The expediency of an additional duty on tJieft
articles is indicated by an important faCt. About
1,890,000 pounds of them were imported into th'
United States in the course of a year, ending- tht
30th of Sept. 1790. A duty of. two cents pei
pound would, it is presumable, (peeJily put anend
to so considerable an importation. And it is ir :
every view proper that an end should be put to it.
The manufacture of these articles, like that o!
Lome others, fuflfersYrom the carelelTnefs and dif ]
honesty of a part of those who carry it on, Anj
;nfpeCtion in certain cases might tend to correCt'
the evil. It will i.eferve confiderarion whether aj
regulation of this fort cannot be applied, without
incon vcnience, to the exportation of the articled
either to foreign countries, or from one state to a
nother.
The implements of husbandry are made in
lev eral states in great abundance. In many place. 1
it is done by the common blacksmiths. Anc
there is no doubt that an ample supply for the
whole country can with great ease be procured
among ourfeives.
Various kinds of edged tools for the use of me
chanics are also made ; and a considerable quanti
ty of hollow wares ; though the business of cart
ings has not yet" attained the perfection which
might be wifiied. It is however Improving, anij
as there are respeCtable capitals in good hands,
embarked in the prosecution of those branches of
iron manufactories, which are yet in their infan
cy, they may all be contemplated as objeCts not
difficult to be acquired.
To ensure the qnd, it seems equally fafe anc!
rudent to extend the duty ad valorem upon al.
manufactures of iron, or of which iron is the ar
ticle of chief value, to ten per cent.
Fire arms and other military weapons may it i:
conceived, be placed without inconvenience in thi
clals of articles rated at fifteen per cent. Then
exilt already manufactories of these articles, w'nicf
only require the stimulus of a certain demand t<
render them adequate to the supply of the Unitei
States.
It would also be a material aid to mannfaCtorie
of this nature, as well as a mean of public fecun
ty, if provilion should be made for an annual pur
chafe of military weapons, of home manufaCtur
to a certain determinate extent, in order to thi
formation of arsenals j and to replace from tim
to time such as should be withdrawn for use, so a
always to have in store the quantity of each kind
which should be deemed a competent supply.
But it may hereafter deserve legillative confi
deration, whether of all the necef
(ary weapons of war ought not to be eltabiifhed
on account of government itfelf. S-ich eftabiiih
ments are agreeable to the usual practice of nu
:10ns, and that praCtice ieems founded on fuflicien
rcafon.
There appears to be an improvidence, in leav
ing these elfential instruments of national de
rence to the casual peculations of individual ad
venture ; a resource which canlels be relied upon
in this cale than in mod others 5 the articles ii
quertion not being objects of ordinary and indif
penfable private consumption or use. As a gener
al rule, manufactories on the immediate accoun
of government are to be avoided j but this seem
to be one of the few exceptions, which that ru><
admits, depending on very special reasons.
Manufactures of steel, generally, or of whici
steel is the article of chief value, may with advan
cage be placed in the clals of goods rated at fevej
ana an half per cent. As manufactures of thi
kind have not yet made any considerable progress
t is a reason for nut rating them as as t'nof<
>f iron ; but as this material is the basis of them
ind as their extenfjon is not less practicable, thai
mportanr, it is deferable to promote it by a some
vhat higher duty than the present.
A question arises, how far it might be expedien
o permit the importation of iron in pigs and bar
ree from duty. It would certainly be favorabii
o manufacturers of the article ; but the doubt i
vhether it might not interfere with its produc
ion.
Two circumstances, however, abate if they d<
lot remove apprehension, on this score ; one is
he considerable encreafe of price, which has beer
ilready remarked, and which renders it probabli
hat the free admifilon of foreign iron would no
>e inconsistent with an adequate profit to the pro
;rietors of iron works ; the other is, the augmen
a:ion of demand, which would be likely to atten<
:nc encreale of manufactures of the article, ir
:onlequence of the additional encouragements pro
)o!ed to be given. But caution nevertheless in Â«
natter of this kind is mod advisable. The mea
ure fuggefled ought perhaps rather to be contem
tlated, lubjeCt t;> the lights of further experience
han imoituiati iy adopted.
COPPER.
The rr:anufailures of which this article is fuf
:t.{>tible are also of great extent and utility. Un
ier Xliis ciefcription, those of brass, of which it i:
:he principal ingredient, are intended to be in
C 1 ud-rd *
The material is a natural production of thi
:ountry. Mines of copper have aCtually beer
vroiight, and with profit to th- undertakers
hough it is not known, that any are now in rhii
:onditÂ»on. And nothing is easier, than the intro
luCtion of it, from other countries, on moderau
:erms, and in great plenty.
and brass founders, particularly
he foimer, are numerous in the United States,
r ome of whom carry on business to a reTpcCta'uli
sxtent.
To multiply and extend manufactories of thi
materials in question is woithv of attention ant
effort. In order to this, it is desirable to facili
rate a plentiful supply of the materials. And ;
proper mean to this end is to place them in tin
clals of free articles. Copper in plates and bras
are already in this predicament j but copper ir
pigs and bars is not j neither is iaph calamivaris
which together with coppcr and charcoal, confti
tute the component ingredient* of brass. Thi
exemption from duty, by parity of reason, oughi
to embrace all such of these articles, as are objeCt:
of importation.
An additional duty, on brass wares, will tent
to the general end in view. These now stand a
five per cent, while those of tin, pewer and cop
per are rated ;;t seven nr.d an half. There appear:
to bp a propriety in every viiw in placing bras:
wares upon the fame level with them j and it mer
its con si deration whether the duty upon all of then
ought nut to be iaiicd to ten [>er cent.
LEA D.
There are numerous proofs, that thi* materia
abounds in the United States, and requires little
to unfold it to an extent, more than equal to ever}
domedic cccafion. A prolific mine of it ha:
long been open in the fouth-weftein parts of Vir
ginia, and under a public administration, ourini
the late war, \ielded a considerable supply for mi
litary use. This is now in the hands of individu
als, who not only carry it on with fpiric, but have
eftablifiied manufactories of it, at Richmond, ir
the fame Hate.
The d.ujies, already laid upon the importatior
of this article, either in its unmanufactured, 01
manufactured state, ensure it a decisive advantag<
in the home marketâwhich amounts to consider
able encouragement. If the duty on pewter ware:
fiionld be railed, it would afford a further encour
agement. Nothing else occurs as proper to be ad
ded.
FOSSIL COAL.
This, as an important instrument of manufac
tures, may without impropriety be mentioned
amoDg the subjeCts Â©f this report.
A cop".-.!;? {â¢;pply of it would be of confe
quencc to tne iron branch : As an article of hou/e
---liold fuel alio ic is an interesting production ; the
utility of which must encreafe in proportion to the
of wood, by the progress of i'ettJeraent
and cultivation. And its importance to naviga
tion, as an immenle article of tra.nfportation
Lualt-wife, is signally exemplified in Great-Liri
tain.
I is known, that there are several coal mines
in Virginia, now worked, and appearances of their
exigence are familiar in a number of places.
The expediency of a bounty on all this species
or coal of home production, and of premiums, on
the opening of new mines, under certain qualifica
tions, appears to be worthy of particular examina
tion. '1 he great importance of the article will
ampiv jufiify a reasonable expence in this way, if
it (hall appear to be necefiary to, and ihail be
thought likely to answer, the end.
WOOD.
Several manufactures of this article flourifli in
the United Stales. Ships are no where in
greater perfection, and cabinet wares, generally,
are made little if at all inferior to those of Eu
rope. Their extent is such as to have admitted
;>f considerable exportation.
An exemption from duty of the several kinds of
'Vood orornarily used in these feetns
obe all, that is req ui site, by way of encourage
rnent. Jc is recommended by the consideration of
i fimiJar policy being pursued in other countries,
ind by the expediency of giving equal advantages
o our own workmen in wood. The abundance
>f timber proper for (hip building in the (Jniied
States does no: appear to be any objection to it.
rhe encreafing icarcity and the growing import
:ance of that article, in the European countries,
idmoniih the United States to commence, and
y(tematically to pursue, measures for the prefer
/ation of their flock. Whatever may promote
he reguiar eftabiiflrment of magazines of ihip
iinber, is in various views defireable.
SKINS.
There are scarcely any manufactories of rrra-er
mpwrtance, than of this article. Their direct
Â«nd very happy influence upon agriculture, by pro
moting the railing of cattle of different kinds, is, a
'ery material recummendation.
It is plealing too, to observe the extensive nro
;rels they have made in their piincipal brandies j
vhich are lo lar matured as almost to defy foreign
ompetition. Tanneries in particular are not on
y carried on as a regular bufinels, in numerous
nltances and in various parts of the country ;
)ut they constitute in lome places a valuable
tem of incidental family manufactures.
Representations however have been made, ;m
--->orting the expediency of further encouragement
o the leather branch in two ways j one by en
reafing the duty on the manufactures of it, which
ire imported ; the other by prohibiting the ex
>ortation of bark. In support of the latter it is
[Hedged, that the price of bark, chiefly in confe
rence of large exportations, has risen within a
"ew years from about three dollars to four dollars
*ad a half per cord.
These suggestions are submitted rather as into
nations, which merit considerations, than as mat
ers, the propriety of which is manifelt. It is
ioc clear, rhat an encrrafe of duty is necefTary ;
rnd in regard to the prohibition defiied, there is
Â»o evidence of any considerable exportation hi
herto ; and'it is most probable, that whatever
lugmentation of price may have taken place, is to
>e attributed to an extension of the home demand
rom the encreafe of manufactures, and to a dc
reafe of the supply in consequence of rhe pro
ofs of fettlcment, rather than to the quantities
vhich have been expoited.
It is mentioned, however, as an additional rea
on for the prohibition, that one species of the
>ark usually exported is in some fort peculiar to
he country, and rhe material of a very valuable
Ive, of great use in some other manufaCtuies, in
vhiih the United Scates have begun a compe
ition.
