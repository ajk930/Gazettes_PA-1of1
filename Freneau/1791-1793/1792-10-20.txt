UNIVERSAL militarydefpotifiri is, j
beyond all doubt, the system to be ,
enforced and propagated by the con! men- .
tal powers combined agaiiift France. From (
hence one would be led to enquire in what â 
manner this oniverfal military despotism |
will injure the feveial orders of society, ;
the in'terefts of inferior princes, and the
persons and families of dcfpots themselves ;
With regard to aristocracy, in Turkey |
<( there is none of it fubfilting as to fami- j
lies, it being the policy of that govern- ]
ment to interrupt fucceffion3. In Ruffis, ,
the great by birth are difcountenairced, and
live for the mod pait discontented at Mof.
cow ; while new men, foreigners, and
favourites, find their way at court. In
Spain, the grandees are not permitted to
quit the court or capital ; or else when
they wish to travel, even within Spain it
felf, they are obliged to give an account
of their motions ; and new men are daily
iUrting up to supplant them in court fa
vour. Even in France, they were all
lately obliged by a fort of etiquette, which
was the result of a court system, to serve
in the r.rmy, at the fame time that the
allurements of a polished and enlightened
capital were fufficient of themfeves to in
jure their residence in the neighbourhood*
of the coutt. I need not fay more a? to
the aristocracy.âNext come the clergy,
whose dignitaries even in France, were
looked at with a jealous eye, when they
pretended to re fide at their poll of duty in
the provinces. In Ruflu, it was the boall
of Czar Pete? to have reduced his clergy
to much moic fubmifiite terms than
Louis XIV had done. In the dominions
of.- iÂ« Audrinn family, notwithdandiiig
the pretertde! devout charadter of the late
eivipre's, the clergy are plundered, and
rendered daily more and more impotent,
by ever)' branch of her descendants in
their different dominions ; and the pope
has experienced repeated insults or litiga
tions from them all. The decline not
only of religious credulity, but even of
religious f.tith, daily weakens the support
of the clergy; and their riches are
a perpetual temptation to needy princes,
ot source of discontent to the fu'ojedt ; and
that part of these riches therefore which
is tenable, will be assumed by the despot ;
and that part which is unpopular, will be
surrendered to the people, to soothe them
in some moment of difTatisfadtion ; and be
replaced probably in some inadequate man
ner, orelle end in the clergy being t thrown
upon the people for voluntary contributions.
As to the pow/ers and privileges of the
hierarchy, we know from the cases of
Henry Vlfl. of England, and Czar Peter,
how fafhionable it will seem to despots, to
be declared the supreme heads of their re
fpedtive churches; and fuppoling that
they (hould be inclined to contemplate
the clergy, rather as a source of support,
than of hoftiiity, it is still natural that
they should think of making this order at
once obedient and (economical; for which
the method is perfedtly simple, and free
from the objedtions fuggelled by Mr.
.Hume. I mean, by reducing the whole
clerical efti.blifhment to its gospel limpli
â¢city, and appointing all the members of it;
giving them a previous bigotted and eti
llaved education, rendering the chiefs of
it few, and utterly dependent, piofcribing
ill novelties, nuking its ceremonies paya
ble out erf civil funds, and obliging civil
and military personages to give such a
character of ostentation to religion, as it is
thought necefiary it should receive. So
much for the clergy âNext comes the
ftnate, compounded in part of the pre
ceding orders. Civil power we have lup
pofed extindt, for inter arma ItgesJtlent, of
what use then is the senate ? To do good,
it it inadequate ; ar.d when there is no
public, it cannot even expedt the pay given
to mercenaries, focthe evils it might other
*iÂ£t fandtian, as ih intermediate body.

To fee the extremity of the evil, let it be i
remafiibered that Caligula made his horse ;
into a consul; and that Didius after hav- (
ing bought the Roman Purple, which was I
openly put to auction by the pretorian
guards, went strait to the senate to tell i
them in express wdrds, that they Wanted 1
an emperor, and lie was the man to an- i
fwer their purpose ; and Charles XII. of i
fjweden, when he was wandering aboat i
Germany and Poland, wafting the forces l
arid treasures of his people, and Embroiling :
their intereil, sent word to his senate, that i
if they refufed obedience to his orders*
he would fend back his boot to govern I
them âAs to the third eftatc, it Wants its <

B lit evert in its more expanded (hape, of i
private citizens, what is it but the mere !
fubilratum of power ; beings who are to I
labour, but not to enjoy ; who are to fuf- <
fer not to complain, and who arc to
contribute without receiving any other i
protection for it, than is suggested by ca- i
price, or commanded by intefeft. S ife I
neither in property rfor in person ; denied
the power of locomotion for their own
purposes, but forced to abandon their
homes and families for the obi cits of pow

inclinations, there to provoke the revenge
of an enemy, or to confirm their own fla
very and that of other nations ( their pro
perty and their labour pressed into the
service of the despot or his fnbalterns,
whenever it suits their purposes ; no utte
ranee allowed to any of their wrongs, each
ta*n being too wife to fpeakopenly,ana yet
afraid of his neighbour in private ; these
and a thousand limilar circumltances, are
so ordinary in despotic countries, as scarce
ly to excite notice : but madmen indeed
are those, who ate content to let such a lot
become their own.âTrade, commerce,
agriculture, and the arts, cannot exist
Â« â¢ â¢
where capita), laws, activity and know
ledge are wanting. We might as well
expedt the vegetable and animal world to
exist without the vivifying power of the
fun.âBelides, tyranny never will, allow
that long continuance of tranquility and
confidence, and that identity of laws,
which are necelury for the flow procefles
of induflry, and that fifcerhood in it, with
out which there is little of it which can
prosper. Arts of amusement, such ar.
intiflc, and watch making, which lad was
the occupation of the grave Charles the
Fifth ; or else the military profefTion,
while attention to it is found neceflary ;
together with ceitain eftabliftiments of a
public nature, which though profufely or
unfkilfiilly conducted, yet will be sure of
protedtion, because in the hands of him
who is trtader of everything, may to a
certain degree floitriftl j and botany, che
midry, and mathematics may retain a ha
zardous existence, because they may be
cultivated without lending any spring and
extension to the human mind, and there
fore without causing umbrage ; but ac
cident alone can lead us to expedt any
great enlargement of tiiis catalogue of
objedts beyond mere articles of necessity.
âThe effedt of an inroad upou the laws is
too easily comprehended to require much
illnflration ; yet even here I (hall observe,
that from the judicial and legislative
branches retting in the fame hands, in the
cafe of defpotii'm, the adminidratisn of
justice must neceflarily require much in
; liability; the violence and caprice of the
despot will add to this evil ; and ilill more
I his favouritifm and the venality of his fnb
i alternÂ». Courts of law in these situations
i only afford a more cxpenfive mode of ar
â¢ riving at injujlice, and have the finglc ad ,
? vantage of bringing suits to some iltue.
Be it observed, however, that under these
circnm(lances foreniic talents have little
f chance of making progress, unless under
, the wing of favour ; and that the profef
> fional pay of the lawyer 15 here small, and
1 hi* consideration in his country trifling,
. compared with what is known in England,
. whwe the law has been the foundatioa of
many noble and wealthy families, as well
as of the molt fplertdid deputations : 'some
of our very barriitets, for example, having
been kuowh in many parts of Europe.
We now come to two critical bodies, hii
nifters and the army. In England we
have seen a miilifter capable of holding his
sovereign at bay ; and one of the common
modes of attaining apoft in administration
is, by becoming important in opposition ;
the career to high offices also is open to
all j and to be eje&ed from ministry is no
dilgtace, but nay even produce honor.
How different is this from despotic coun
tries, where minilters live by the . breath
of a tyrant ; where death, banlfhment, or
difgracc, mark a reverse of fortune ; where
it is commonly an etiquette, never to rein
date the fallen ; and where they afe often
treated with such contempt in the con
cerns of their office, that the late king of
Prufiia is affirmed once to have said to his
njinilters, Canaille, arranged <v>>us. No'
%ate opens a road to power ; and to I
of alarming the public on public to
pics, would be instant death. In this (late
of things these is nothing to expedt but
from prostitution, from bribery, and from
intrigue ; and the difpenfor of offices and
power, is commonly a mistress in male
courts, a paramour in female ones, and
pimps, panders, domeflics, flatterers and
intriguers in all of them.âLastly, we are
to speak of the army ; for the army at
lead, as the instrument of all, will be
thought an order in. the date, not only
sure of protedtion, but of solid encourage
ment. By no means. The common sol
dier is no where more opprelled, than in
despotic dates ; for to give room, sos to
keep up many troops, he is poorly paid;
and to supply the want of inclination, he
tfc made a mere machine, and the moving
power of which is his fear. In all armies
too, there is the diftindtion of body guards
or pretorian bands on the one fide, and
the marching regiments or troops of the
line on the other. The former may be
carefTed, and the latter neglected : Trie
foimer are near the source of court favors,
hold the sovereign in their hands, and are
the commencers of revolutions ; but the
iatter are considered as little more than
ordinary fubjedts ; and when any part of
them are discontented, the reft are made
to oppose them ; which, in a vast army,
is perfedtly eaiy. Who can deny too.
that favourites proceed by a rapid progrels
to principal commands, in defiance of vet e
ran pretensions; and that civil suspicions
and punilhments are eaiily extended to mi
litary persons. Besides, who is there likely
to rebel from civic feelings in adefpotiear
iny, made up by policy from vagrants and
banditti, from foreign or from lavage ma
terials, and where every thing is kept as
much infnlated and d'.feonneited a3 possi
ble, unless where any of the parties poffeis
kindrted principles and interells witli the
despot ? In ihort, a great army i 3 easily
kept under by civil and military laws, aed
a few executioners. What then is to be
the new privilege, or consolation of the
fiulviier oe officer, who in addition to his
military duty is employed to wring taxes
from the poor, to inforce the rigours of
punilhraent, to adt peihaps againlt his
friends or his native province, and to take
up his quarters in abjedt or deserted coun
tries?â Thus we have gone through the
principal orders of focietv, as situated un
der the blasting Operation of a wide spread
ing despotism. Let the m;n who be
friends it, go and live in Turkey and Mo
rocco, as places congenial to his loul.
Let us, in this part of Europe at least,
lift againfl it not only our faces, but our;
fwo'ds,"
In refpedt to the coalition of powers a
gainst France, and the natuial rights of
man, it may be compared to Aaron's rod,
which will fwaliow up the forces of every
other power. This mifchief will happen,
without care, before the world fufpedts
it 5 and no care is fufficient, but that of
demanding an immediate celLition of the
Numb. 102.
Concert of princes ; for if the concert
proceeds, and attains its object, despotism,
unknown (I will do the parties the ju/lice
to suppose) to the wishes of the original
a&ors, will rapidly produce its effects.
Scruples will not long delay the horrid tra
gedy, which however may pass to be acted
in its last fccnes into new and other hands.
But causes will always accomplish their
consequences ; and despotism having al
ways the fame materials to work upon in
those niliffg and rtiled, will generate those
consequences, with a celerity of which I
(hall give but two instances. The firft
is that of Alexander, who was in many
refpefts the boafl of antiquity, but who
inflantly after the fuccefsful contest which
his fathtr and' himfelf had had with the
free nations of Greece and Thrace, tho'
he had Philip for his father, Arillot'le for
his tutor, a ci ilized world which he much
admired for his judges ; though he had
peculiar magnanimity, talents, and love of
science, yet in the course of conquering
the world, killed "his friend in drink, burn
ed a city to arr.ufe a (trumpet, and sighed
when his cruel and fantaltic powe- wa3
checked for want of ohj .'fts. The second
example is drawn from Rome, where, af
ter the calm in htlman affairs produced by
AugulluÃ, none could have fufpefted a
sudden reverse ; yet, in what quick fuc
eeflion did four monllefs appear, rivglljng
and furpalfirrg each other in wickednrfa
and mifchief, and tormenting not.only fo
reign nations and their fnbjedt*, but carry
ing (laughter into the bofotn cf their Own
families ? Soon indeed was it fouud, thaS
Julia, MelTalina, and Eauftina (hewed that
women in a scene of unbounded licenfs
could be as execrable as men ; and (till
farther to prove that levity and cruelty
were cafily "to be affocisted -in the fame
breast, the lame characters which either
formed the wiih that Rome might have
but one neck, or were ready to execute
the full purport of it. fought to play the
part of buffoons and gladiators upon the
(tagc before their subjects, as the great ob
ject of the r ambition.
In one word, (I address myfelf to the
friends of liberty and virtue) beware. You
are in no common times. Powerful princes,
instead of attacking each other for booty,
have began upon the fyitem of attacking
you. Unite on your fide, for it is a corr.r
mon cause It is in vain to think when
this new mifchief is once under way, that
you can fay to it, go thus jar anil no farther.
The parties are poffclTed of this peciftiar
advantage, that they no't only can product
large forces, but they keep large forces
luayt on foot, and therefore are ready to
aÂ£t at a moment's warning, in ord'tr to se
cure their objects. After their fyllem has
obtained a ceitaiti progress, they will bÂ«
hurried on in it, and become unable to
!lop themfclves. And do not flatter your
i'elves that it will ever be retrograde, parti
cularly on account of the apparent 'civili
zation of mankind. We who are to be
devoured indeed are civilized ; but remem
ber that those who are to devour us were
yelWr&iv only Tartars and Cossacks, and
other savage clans ; and that although a
few of their leaders - have that oujlide por
lifh, which you fee is consistent with stony
hearts : yet that when thefo leaders die,
or become corrupted, theJlamina of their
people are fucli, as.fit thctu for supporting
any projeS oj any nature.

LOVES of the PLANTS.
AVERY curious system of the rela
tive (economy of plants, was some
years since publiflicd by Sir Charles Uup
ui'us, of Sweden, who may justly be styled
the author of the sexual iyftem of botany.
His system has (ince been improved orl
and embtllifhed by Mr. Darwin, of Great-
Britain, who has publithed a poetical work
on tie fubjeft, adorned with moll elegant
engravings. His Leading idea is that one
plant of each natural order was createdin the beginning, and that the intermar
riages ofthefc produced one plant of every
genus or family, and that the intermarri
ages of these gcneric or family plant.',
produced all the fpccies ; and lalHy, that
the intermarriages of the individuals of
the species produced the varieties. The
idea of this whole fyltem is wholly ration
al ; but contidered ouly as a work of fan
cy, Mr. Darwin's poem is exquisitely
beautiful and entertaining. The follow
ing is his description of the Mimosa, or
fenlitive plant.
Weak with nice sense, the chaste Mimosa (lands
Frein each rude touch withdraws her timid hands;
Oft as light clouds o'erpafs the summer glade,
Aiarm'd, (he trembles at the moving (hade,
And feels, alive through all her tender form
The whifper'd murmurs of the gathering storm,
Shuts her fwect eye lids to approaching night,
And bails with frelhen d charms the riling light.
V-tiPd with gay decency and modest pride,
Slow to the Mosque (he moves, an eallern bride ,
There herfoft vows unceasing love record,
Queen of the bright Sera'lio of her lord-
So finks, or ri(es with the changeful hour
The liquid silver in the glafly tower !

FOREIGN NEWS:
T. O N D O N, Aug. 14 â20.
A temperate reform in church and state
is now called for, almost univerlally, by
men of literature and faience. Efta'blidi
nients, well adapted to an age ofbarbarifm,
ought to be reviewed in an age of civiliza
tion, and rendered compatible with the
progrellive improvement of the christian
world.
The creed of Athanajius, with the conco
mitant anathemas, can hardly now be pro
nounced from the pulpit by any learned di
vine ; nor is it confident with the genius
of our holy religion, to condemn whole
tribes of mankind to all eternity, because
they differ from others in some points of
metaphysics. Yet superstition still adheres
to liturgies and solecism to creeds-, nor have
the penal laws, refpe&ing religion, hither
to ceased to disgrace the statute book of
England, though brought under the review
of the legislature, by a statesman, of the
firft rank of abilities in the Britifli Se
nate.
Such absurdities, however, cannot be
long maintained ; and a propensity to re
form is likely to originate within the bo
som of the eilablifhed church. Mr. Stock
dale, in addreliing his d:ocefan, has descri
bed genius, literature, and science, as al
moll invincible obftruftious to ecclesiastical
preferment. Nor does he exhaust his elo
quence in general declamation, but has fpe
cified individuals, under episcopal patron
age, whom we fhallnot presume to describe.
M. B. perhaps, may come forward as their
counlel, but the brother of Alderman Curtis
is not mentioned in the lift. The dignita
ries of the church ought, surely, to be pa
trons of learning, detectors of superstition,
not its advocates, and the propagators of
moral truth. But the doctrines of real re
ligion, by being incorporated with supersti
tion, have too often been exposed to deri
sion. Preserve them in their genuine puri
ty. and they uitift infallibly command ref
pecl. A reform then in the church, if con
duced with propriety, would tend as effec
tually to adorn eccleliaftics, and to confer
true dignity on them as prelates,as a reform
in the itate would redound to the honor of
the people at large, and exalt the dignity of
the superior orders. Happy, said Plato, will
tie people be, when their rulers are pbi
lofophers. That a:ra seems now to have
commenced in both heniifperee; and in
the progress of civilization, the prediction of
Plato will be realized in the government of
nations.
In an American paper, which lately came
to hand, we find the following paragraph :
Nezvhampjluie, Keene, March 22.
"A singular factâ We hear from Enfield,
in the upper part of this county, that as
t.vo men were eroding a pond in pursuit of
a moose-deer, one of them being thirsty,
aid perce ving a hole which had been cut
through the ice by some fifhermen, he
stooped down to drink, but being poflcded j
of a long red nose, a fidi ftippofed he had !
some bait, and made bold to (nap at it, when
t te man suddenly throwing his head back,
drew out a trout, which weighed three '
pounds four ounces !"
Since the dilcovery of the circulation of the
blood there has not been arii:coveryequal to
thisânothing which will tend more to fa
cilitate the art of angling, and render the
implements of fid'.ery so cheap. Immedi
ately 011 reading this account a gentleman
Went to the New-I'oi k coft'ee-Jioufe, and
enquired if any perfotis had very larely ar
rivtd from America. He found several,
who confirmed the truth of this fail, by pro
ducing other liewfpapers, into which ,1 nad
been copied. The evidence was now com
plete, a id he immediately fat down to im
prove upon the dillor v. The leading
fact here eitabliftied is, that " red noses area
$ooH and fufficient iaitfor trout. 1 ' We will not
ltop here to d.Here on uie Jnoofe-huniiiig,
which probably is a diversion peculiar to
Enfield, in New-Hamplhire, as hunting the
lleeple is in some provinces in England, not
to (peak of chafing butterflies and empe
ror's ot Moroccoâbut will proceed to ob
lerve upon the faÂ£t itfelf, that if due en
couragement is given to the breed of red
noses, catching trout will soon be as easy
as taking fnuft". To ascertain the faÂ£t, how
ever, by experiment, which, now and then,
is a pretty certain way of proving farts, the
gentleman went down to his country feat
in Surry, where he has an excellent fifh
pond. Oil his arrival he called together
liis tenants and servants, that he might find
â a proper person, that is, a person with a
proper nose, long and red, as described in
the New-Hamplhire account. With some
difficulty he discovered a nose of the proper
dimenlions, namely, three inches and an half
long, and at the broadefl part, one inch and
three quarters. A better nose could not
be conceived as to length, but it wanted
redness. He was I'utprized at this, because
the fellow who owned the nose, had often
been brought before him, as a justice of
peace, for getting drunk and romping with
the maids. His servant, however, whis
pered him, " your honour will please to re
member that you took away the fpirit-li
ccnce from the public house lait year.''
This accounted for the matter at once. He
took the feiiow into the house, and fending
to town for a lix gallon keg of true Britifil
spirits, he pretended to make this fellow
keeper of it. The scheme answered, for
in less than a month he had reason to think
his nose a fufficient temptation to any trout
in the kingdom. He then took him to the
pond, and inftrufted him how to proceed.
He lay for an hour with his nose about half
an inch in the water, but nothing came.
1 he gentleman encouraged him, however,
to perlevere, and to his utter joy, a trout of
the precise weight, described in the printed
account from New-England, in an uaguar
ded moment, (educed by acrimfon concu
piscence, made a bile at the fellow's nose ;
who throwing his head back, as he had been
taught, produced the fifh, The fact was
so plain that the gentleman made him re
peat the experiment, and it was always at
tended with equal success.

Amjlerdam, Aug. 17. âThe wrent events in
France have thrown all the men of dilrretion
in ihe United Provinces into confufion. At Am
llerdam and Rotterdam it is much feared that
fcvcral private fottunes aie totally facrificed,
and that France will gradually find hcrfclf more
and more unable to fulhl her pccuniaty en
gagements with foreigners. As yet, however,
ihe funds have not fullered.

the lufpenfion of the king of France. It is
thought that the fame conduct will be followed
by all the other powers, and that that kingdom
will thus have no minifler acknowledged on any
fide. It :s further fa'id, that the (hip builders
in Holland are preparing in hade all the ved'els
of war. It is a qucdion whether a fleet (hall put
to sea, and as the Enghfh mir.ifter is frequently

will likewise trice a part in the attack of France

plate on the Irontiers which cannot fail to
let French bravery in a itriking point oi

to their colonel, who, -a 'nor a he came

opinion of the war, snd whether he thought

in his turn, if he might be allowed to speak
his mind with freedom ? Yes, (replied the
colonel) fay whatever yon have a mindâ
1 wi(h to know then (said the countryman)
Whether you intend to inarch to Paris ? " Certainly,

The colonel, with some surprize, asked
what mountains these could be ? Mountains!
said the fellow ; why, they are mountains that

conducive to the advancement of the nautical
art, geography, agronomy, natural history,
and the knowledge of the globe we inhabit.
This squadron undertakes four separate
expeditions, whose object is nearly the
fame, to determine with all pofiible pre
cision that immense length ofcoaft which
bounds the Spanifli Empire in all parts of
the globe. This object however, is not
the sole one : from their observations is to
be compiled a maritime Atlas, cleared of
all that multiplicity of errors which dis
grace the works of the ablest navigators of
former times ; they are enjoined to make
exact charts of all seas, i (lands, continents,
&c. that shall be in their several routs,
during the conrfe of their immense voy
age. The ardour of these our modern Ar
gonauts is redoubled by the news lately re
ceived of the squadron under the command
of Don Alexander Rlalafpina. This officer,
after traversing the Vast Ocean that bounds
the northern coalts of the western fide of
America, and surveying those coafls with
all poflible exarfnefs, returned by the fame
rout, and anchored in the port of Acapnl
co, on the Mexican ocean. There lie caus
ed two light vessels to be built, with which
lie undertook to fail northward again, coal
ing the American shore?, with a view 10
decide the^ famous question, whether there
existed a communication between the At
lantic and Pacific oceans The re
peated attempts of the English 011 the
leafteru fide of North America, together
with the efforts of the celebrated Cooke in
his last voyage 011 the wefterll, had the f-ine
object in view. After his death captain
. lerke, King, &c. attempted it; the Ruf
fians and Spaniards had also made a multi
plicity of voyages for the fame purpose ;
from all of which it was inco'ntefliblv pro
ved that noftich communication existed by ;
any gulph or inlet into the com nent from
the main ocean, as was formerly believed,
to be the cafe. But it still remains doubt
ful, whether ihtre may not be inch a pallage
by some river which discharges itfelf into
the western ocean from the northern con- '
tinent of America, communicating with ihe
northern Atlantic through Baffin's,or rather
Hudson's bay, which extends much the
fartheftinto the continent. These two Imall
vefieis may be supposed tobs now 011 their
discoveries ; and to prevent any failure, no
navigable river on the whole northern coast
is to be left unexplored, to the head of na
vigation, and even every branch is to be ex
amined with the most fcrupulotiscare. The
solution ot this grand question is in every
respect worthy of the Spanish nation, pof
feflingfuch prodigious tracts of colony a.-, they
clo in America. It is also hoped that every
enlightened nation, whose interests are the
fame with ours, will aid us in such an ex
renfive undertaking. The crews of the ves
sels destined for these long voyage, are in
the best health ; and during three years,
that mod of them have been at fca 011 dif
ferent expeditions, not afingie man has di
ed of the scurvy, which is so frequently fa
tal in voyages to the remote weflern re
gions. The officers ofevery grade have re
ceived signal marks offavourfrom the king,
presents, pensions, and honours in abun
dance. It is now fincerety hoped that Spain
will at length deviate'from that line of
policy, (lo long obft ived by her) not to tub
hfh the dijcoveries made in her nautical exfeciitiens
and that voyages undertaken upon so pm
lofophical a plan may not fail of their de
served uccefs ; but may add some valuable
pages to the boooic of human science and
ihe knowledge already attained. At an)
rate, it is to be hoped that the lot cf theft
navigators w ill be more fortunate than that
of M. de la Pejroufe.

this inliance was very generally approved, as the
: bill, thus amended, was, bevond ail doubt, ex
tremely odious to the people in general. The
House of Reprelentatives immediately ordered
another bill to be drawn up, which having re
ceived the ailentol the Senate, was functioned by
the President. By this law the number of re

â an impartial view of American Congrefiional
proceedings, that as the Representative chamber
,of their legiflatute becomes more and more de
( mcciatic, the Senate is fortifying itfelf in cer

hij,h Kiea ofihe fun nels of, the*ffenate, but nou
rilher, in secret, among their conffiiuent?, a spirit

I terminate fatally for the S; nators. The condtift
I of ihe Ameiican Senate, in these various circum

for profound reflexion on this fide of the Atlantic.
In iheir conduct worn ay fee how strong is the.
tendency in mankind to abuse their delegated

the inihtution o! these two houses is to the cause
of liberty; particu'ailyin a country where (he
seemed to have fixed herfelf upon' a basis that
would defy the ravages of time and be proof to
the machinations of intrigue-.; where the natural

with every precaution that human ingenuity

VA statement of Jome Objections to the AdmWiJlrs

(From tie Gametic (f the United
[Continued tium our last and concluded. J
favc the riterÂ» in the Gazette ol tht
United Stares, the trouble of mifunder
fta tiding me, I wlli in the moil explicit mannej
explain what I jo, and what 1 do not object to, ii
rnc funding ly ft em ; I wiU begin with the nega
tive part of my declaration because chat will re
quire the f ewe ft words.
jft. 1 do not object to the payment of the just
public debts, and in a manner fully adequate tc
the contract, merit or Baiter, out of which the
debts originally grew.
2d. i da not objeCt to the mode of raising the
public revenue by an imp >ft on imported goods.
1 only wiih that the import: might be confined tc
imported luxuries, or luch articles as are mofth
used by the rich, and that the confuinptions ol
the poor may be free of burden as far as may wc.
be, contiftent with the ends and uses of the tax.â
Indeed 1 don't know but 1 claim that mode of re
venue as my original thought or invention, whicl
1 publiihed and explained in my sixth efiay on frci
trade and finance in 1753, long before any parti'
cular mode of general revenue was difculTed, 0
even proposed in Congress, which ever came to mj
knowledge.
3d. 1 do not Â©bjeCt to the institution of banks
but think the bank of the United States an in
fringement of the publicfaith plighted to the ban!
of North America, and an ungrateful retributioi
for tke great merit and exertions of that bank tc
the salvation of our country in the time ol it
greatcft danger and distress.
4th. I now come to the positive part of my ob
jedtions to the funding system. I objeCt to thÂ«
*11 ode of tailing a revenue by an excise on tithe:
the produce or manufactures of the countryâthi
excifc on home uiftilieries includes bothj the labo
is that of our own people, and the raw material
are all, except foreign moiailes, the produce of thi
country ; I,object to this duty, ift, because thi
nature of its collection requires an authority in th<
excise officer to enter the domains ot every indivi
dual, infpedt his private business and concerns
and even frarch his mod retired apavtments, bee
rooms and clcfetsâand ad, becaule the colleCtior
is not only thus irritating, but is alio very expen
sive ; I am told that the collection of the prefeni
excise coits about 12 per cent, besides all tin
wrangles about it, which are in themselves ever
expeniive as well as pernicious; 3d, because the
duty is alrn'oft wholly paid by the poor, efpec;all>
by tie frontier people who are a ufelul set of men,
help co people, cultivate and defend the country,
but from their fiiuation neceflarily have a hardet
lot than the more interior inhabitants, and 1 think
it cruel to begrudge them a little whisky of their
own distilling to comfort their hearts under all
their trials and hardfhi|Â»s # or to diminish their en
joyment by adding expence and other odious cir
cumitstiTCes thereto. 15ut my greatest objection is
more to the difpcf.il of the money, when it is col
lected, than to the existing mode of aflefling 01
collecting itâthe money when colleCted from the
labors ot the people, is given by the funding iyf
tern, not to" the men who criminally earned it, no
to the men to whom th t public faith was plighted
over and over again, not to men who contribut
ing theirJulflanceand fer vices, saved cur country,
laved us all in the time Â©f deepeit d'ftrefsâbut by
this fatal system a title is given and payments ac
tually made of an immense treasureâthe dear
earnings of the forementioned patriots, not to them,
I fay, but to a parcel of speculators who never
earned a fliilling of it, or paid any adequate comâ¢
penfation for it, or even set up any kind of title
to it, grounded either on their merit, earnings, Jer
vices, or any purchaie for valuable confederations
paid, but they cla Â» and receive it under a most
extravagant coriiru&ion off an old rule of law,
firaincd, - ndJit etched tar beyond every reason on
which the lav/ ever was and is now grounded.
The following is a plain statement of the faCts
which I rffer in the face ol all the world, and
challenge all your writers, and every body else to
deny or controvert them if they can.
lit. The public faith was pl ghted in most so
lemn manner to the original public creditor* toi
the payment of such supplies and services as the)
rendered to the public.
2d, In thÂ« fettlementof their accounts the bal
lances due to them were adjusted, ascertained anc
recorded in the public books, where they ftant
open to infpedtion at this day.
3d, When their lefpective ballances becamc
due, they were no otherwifa paid than by depre
ciated certificates, worth at theircurrent exchange
about 2/6 in the pound, which ought to be debited
to their accounts, and the remaining ballances
â paid in good money ; for public bills or papei
credit are ever to be valued at their exchange, anc
jio more, and all nations uegociate them in thai
Way alone.
But, 4th, The funding system plights the pub*
lie faith for the payment of the whole origina
debt, to the holders of the certificates, most ol
which have been fold far a trifle by the origina,
holders, and are now found in the hands of pur.
chafers, who never earned the money or paid any
adequate confiderarion for it, but are entitled b)
this system to receive it all.
This, beiides injustice, ingratitude, and viola
tion of public faith plighted to the real creditors,
involves mifchicfs and brings on consequences ve
ry hurtful to the prosperity of the nation.
1. Payment to the real original creditors would
have been an a? 1 ofjuflice, and some reparation tc
many worthy citizen*, who have long luffered by
the public deficiencyâwould have animated theii
indujlry, and in very many inltances delivered
them from aCtual dependence for a support either
on abjefi servitude, or the charity of their neigh
bors } âwhereas payment of the fame monies to
the (peculators, raifesafew men to sudden wealth,
which thev never earned, and which, as they arc
tjot qualified by habit or education to enjoy pro
perly, does them more harm thangood.
This, as far as it goes, accumulates the mone)
cf the country in a few ufeleis hands, and at the
fame time lessens that diffufive circulation which
wotfld animate the industry and increase the wealth
and happiness of the people in general through
the nation.
2* As Congress fat at New-York when the
funding system was yader dilcuflion, the specula-
Tors there and in the vicinity frjlcotcbcd the fc
cret of that magical logicâwhich was to tuu
>/6 into 20f. and diligently improved the precio 5
moment, and sent off large orders to the iouuiei' 1
itates tor buying immenle quantities of certifi
cates, tor the trifle which was then their current
value j and when they brought them to the north
ward, the funding fyitem made them all payable
:o the holders tliereâto that the northern peopl*
will receive all the caill tor them, whiM the bur-
Jen of raiting the money will press equally haid
on the fouthcrn as on the northern states.
This, in etfedt, will make the fjuthern ftatesin
a manner tributary to the people Â»t the northern
tales in a large turn of annual inter eft 5 and a:
nis must continue as long as the system lasts, 1'
uetomcs a serious matter, b.'g with consequence!
hurtful enough both to the unionoc to ihe loutheri
people, and obvious enough to render a prophetica
Jctail unnecefiary here.
3. As cur 6 per Cents and other funds are fei
at an higher interest than can be obtained for mo
ney loaned in Europe* Very gfeat purchase:
have been made by Europeans in onr tunds, anc
ihey have remitted vast turns ot money for thai
purpose, which has made money, and conlequ*nt
iy luxury, extremely plenty with us at presentâ
and this blejfedplenty of money is by some people
with great doubt aftigned as one of the bltjj'ed ef.
feCis of the funding fydem 5 that it is a njtura
ejjefi of that system, 1 readily admit j but as u
ilie blejj'cdnefs of it, we thall be better able tojudg;
a little while hence, when our country comes to b<
drained of its cath in vast sums, which must b;
lent cut of it [never to telu'n) to pay the year!]
ntereft of the immenle remittances which wi
now receive, together with that of our public so
reign loans*
This country has never yet experienced a drau
!>f its cath by exportation of it abroad, without ie
:eiving remittances of value either previous o
subsequent to the fending it away. Importation
}f goods from abroad, have sometimes exceede<
the refouices of the country, and madecath some
â¢vhat lcarce. But the tinal loss did not all re(
an the countryâmuch afit fell on the foreigi
merchants, by the bankiuptcy ot their coriel
jondents here. We cannot yet well judge hov
jreat the blejj'ednefs of these efFe&s may be, but .
lave had one taste of them, which has quite cloy
:J my appetite, since which I hive not had a will
or a repetition of the bleliing. One thing w
enow by experience, that when sterling bills rit
ibove 75 per cent, it will be the interest, and 0
;ourfe the practice of people who have remittan
:cs to make to Europe, to fend away cath rathe
han bills, in which cafe the real money will go ou
if the country perhaps fafter than it now comes in
11 tine, if these fa&s and observations are tru
md well founded, they deserve the feriou attenti
mof every man.âlf otherwise, any man wh>
vill disprove them, will give me sincere pleature
ind relieve me from many painful anxious feel
ngs. ] f any one desires my true name, he fha!
