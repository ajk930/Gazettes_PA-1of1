Vol. I.
For the NAT 10 NAL GAZETTE.
Mr. FreneatJ,
a remote situation in thecoun-
JL try, I came a few weeks lince tc
the feat of the Federal Government.
The quiet and happiness of every indi
vidual in the country depends so much
on the wife and dilinterefted manage
xnent of public affairs, that my ar.xiet)
to know more of the men and the mea
fuies of the government was beyonc
description. Since my arrival here, ]
have attached mvfelf to no party, bu
Aave mingled as freely as possible wit}
afl, and catched all the information tha:
w..\s in motion.
TVo fubjetts hadlonggiven me mor<
tinea.'jnefs than all others, which in
formation has not yet removed.
ill. Whether our public debt hac
been pled up in fatt through necessity
or through policy ? 2d. Whether th<
individual men who are intrusted wit!
the powers or the country have kep
themselves difmterefted ? On the firft
have very little doubt left. Many facts
which are eafiily come at, have convinc
ed me, that the public debt has beei
swelled to its present amount, as an en
gine of power, rather than from an;
real necessity to support public credit.
One third of the debt conlifts of thi
oldintereft certificates called facilities
These had beeifi fully provided for b;
the old Congress, apd would soon havt
been all paid into the public treasury
Several of the states had paid in thei:
â¢part of the whole of them, and the de
linquent states, feeing the powers of th:
new government, found there was n<
cfcape for them ; they were taking th<
jnoll prompt measures to collefl theii
proportions, and there is no doubt bui
the whole wouldfoon havebeen broughl
into the treasury.
This was one third of the whole debi
which is now on interest under th<
funding law.
The states had also in their treafurie:
many millions of the principal of th<
public debt, the whole of which migh
ealily have been stepped there, whicl
they in fact considered to be funk.
Large sums were due for lands thai
had been (old, contra&s daily offerer
for much more, at a dollar an acre, pref
;ed by the individuals with rcpeatc ,
?nd strong importunity, which togeth r
â would have funk not less than- twen.t'
millions of dollars, in a manner perfc.-ft
]y fatisfaftory to the possessors. T1 jest
opportunities were not embraced.
The debts of the refpeftive ftatr;s t(
the amount of above twenty mi! .lion:
more have been assumed byCongr ;fs.
This appears to havebeen enti .rely <
new scheme, not expected fay the states
and not di&ated by any apparent ftrorn
necessity. A great proportion of these
debts had been funk by the stales, anc
was then in their treasuries, hot is now
again brought into circulation.
These fatts are not to be denic:d, anc
they leave very little grounds to expefl
much from all the pretences about fink
ing funds. Indeed the five million:
that had been alllotted to purchase the
principal of the public debt, appear tc
me to have been (erioufly applied to nc
other ule, but tp be expended in the
market when moibey was scarce to re
lieve individuals an dto raile the pricc
of certificates.
After being obligfl d to make these ob
fervatiens, it would ,'have been a vast re
lief to my mind, te-Jftavc been able to
obtain a iatisfa&ory answer to the fub
jeft of my second en quiry.
Whether the men entrusted with the
powers of the try had kept them
selves difinterefttd V
It has been long :reported that many
of them were in i:aÂ£t partners with bro
kers and ftcck-jobbers, and that the
banking schemes h. c been too power
fully and effectual Â»â¢ Jrefled to their
avaricc. If this is truf ... furnifhes a

perse& explanation of what hasbetn be
fore mentioned: and.itwill ceaffto be i
matter of wonder, that such good term:
are given to the bank, âthat the public
debt has been so mightily increased
and wrought up into such a curiou:
machine of fpeculatiom The love o'
power in some is gratified by their larg'
facrificcs to the love of property it.
others, and these two passions become
the altars of unceasing and mutual fa
crifices, continually imoaking with tht
fat of the land.
The roads to power in this country
are so open, and men who are ftrongl)
pushed by their ambition, and theil
avarice, will be so much more indefa
tigable in their exertions, than an)
others, that they will be but too apt tt
succeed, and there is much evil to thi:
country to be apprehended from tha:
cause, They will form themselves into i
corps like the Jesuits, will fcatterthem
selves every where and not be known
their schemes will all be in concert
pursued with infinitclymoreaddrefsanc
industry, than will ever be raliiec
againfl them. There is great dangei
that the public good will thus be prof
tratcd to private passions.
It is in the power of the Freemen oi
this counsry to prevent these evils. Il
is they, and they only who can prevent
them. I ivifn this moment to ba al>le
to Ipeak in the voice, of thunder, that il
might read 1 every freemen in the Unit
ed States, to impress upon him the im
portance or doing it. Surely there arc
difinterefte d men enough in this coun
try, who a j s known to be disinterested,
to do the public business. This can
be better judged of by the fn-emtv
ihemfelvei , than by any body else. It ii
indeed hai d to punilh a man for crime:
before the y are piovedâbut this is not
aunifhing for crimes,âit is a very dif
ercnt afFs ir,âit is choosing out the man
)f their ci >nfidencc : a suspicion in fuel:
i cafe is ci lough : they should choose oul
he man of their greatest confidence.
The service requires it ; when lie isto be
ent so fa r from them, where his conduÂ£)
rannot be intimately kn<)wn to them
i.nd whet e there will be so many, caufci
o interest improper passions, thej
should find the roan long known tc
them, and of whom there is no suspici
on. If they will not do it, they are si:
l'ubjeÂ£'ls for heavy burdens, they deserve
the yoke. A CITIZEN.

Mr. FR-sneAU,
I Am well aware that the exhausted con
riition of the plantations in Virgini;
and the deranged situation of the finance:
of the yeomanry are considerable obstacle
to their estates becoming immediately pro
duftiveâ but I am confident that by adopt
ing a proper rotation of crops, their ex
hausted fields may be made to answer the
moll sanguine expectations of the Farmer,
On coming into pofieflion of the farn
which I now occupy the average produce
of it did not exceed fix bufnelsot rye to the
acre. The fame ground now yields fron:
20 to 30 bulhels of wheat. This beneficial
alteration has arisen from my pursuing th
rotation of crops, which was some time
ago addrelled to the Philadelphia agricul
tural society. As this rotation is founded
on attuat experiment the whole communica
tion merits attention.
To the Philadelphia Society for Pr-moting
Agriculture.
Gentlemen,
STRUCK with the proprietyand impor
tance of the queltion proposed by your so
ciety to discover the best rotation of crops;
Numb. 54*
â  have been induced to make a variety of
e ;;>erimeuts to ascertain this point. I now
I beg I ave to iubmit them to your consider
ation. together with lome particular and
general observations on the lubjett.

full of weeds, it did not answer for hay,
and therefore was pastured until October,

Dutch plough, for a winter fallow. In
April, 1789, it was well harrowed, and

On the Secretary's Report. $n the Excise.
(Continued from our lufl.)
I WILL now proceed to the cor.ildera
tion of the fourth point in the Secreta
ry'.- report, and the ground, upon which he
controverts the tendency of the Excise Law,
to injure industry. In his arguments oii
this topÂ«c, lie attempts to prove that the
relative situation ofhouie diitilled spirits, is
improved by the excise ; because, as he at
ierts, the duty, comparatively viewed', is in
favor of whiikey ; âbut supposing this 'o be
a fait, what is it calculated and intended to
prove ? surely not that whiikey ihouid bs
the only home manufacture, subject to ex
nfe : 1 he argument, applies with greater
< orce to recommend the impodtion of ex
cise upon the fait that is made in Kentucky,
or the sugar that is near the Cene'ee and
eifewhei e. Jt is directed at once to evince
the propriety of an excise, upon porter,
beer, cheese, barrel beef, leather ihoes.
â¢ opts, and even upon the raw materials oi
m 001, cotton, hemp, and iron. All those
articles are certainly bettered in their rela
tive situation, generally speaking. frorr
7 1-2 to io per cent, by the existing duties,
and therefore by a parity of reasoning
ought to be loaded with an excise. Tht
;uftice and expedience of the regulator
would be as opposite and as 'plausible as ir
tne cafe of whiikey ; and I have no doubt
that principle, if not checked, will be ft
lppfied in clue time. But. the Sccretar)
otters an ingenious - di'ti notion betw'eer
whiikey to Commence his operations.
fie lays, that when a manufacture is arri
ted at maturity, it is as fit a subject of ex
:ife as any other.
What position can more fatisfaftorily dr
moniirate the truth of the obfervjition whicl
I have made oli the native tendency and ac

iere offered, w ill readily adopt i/;felf to eve

I have mentioned, that it is only necefla

perhaps any other spirit. This fuperiorit;
indeed, is known to but few ; for the li

and even where*l have seen some iuftance

I call upon the contrivers and promoter
of the excise upon whiikey, to inform th<
public how many barrels of it have bcei
consumed annually in Philadelphia, or an;
of the great towns in the state. Let th<
gentlemen who travel to Pittfburg, or ii
any different route, declare how often, na;
it ever, they call for whiikey in a tavern.â
Let the judges, who ride the circuit to tht
remotest counties, communicate their ob
fervations of he demand for whiskey, ii
preference to other liquors. AH, all wil
tefiify, as with one voice, that the choict
is almost invariably in favor of rum, ever
though that ipirit is generally of the lowei!
quality and cheapest price upon these roads,
although the whiikey is more than tne hal;
cheaper than rum, in proportion to the com
parative itrength. 1 have admitted, thai
whiskey is capable cf being nrar.iffaCtuvet
to great perfection ; but that it has not at
tained to its maturity, is evident stum the
discouragement undet which it labours ;
no manul.'ct ifre can be in that stale that
does not enjoy a preference in general con
sumption; when, tt.erefoi'e, the very name
of whilkey excites difgUtt, to the palate of
those by wLdfe example tils prevailing taste
of the country is formed ; when it is co;i
funitd chiefly by the labouring'poor,' and'
often Comparatively despised even by them;
i'ureiy; were there no other facis than thete'
to influence our opinions, we ..a.inot heii
ta:e, in fpitetif the ministerial dogma, to
conclude, that the manufacture is uot arri
ved at perfection ; and that, therefore, this
pretence, lor. rendering it the iblirary titb
jeit of internal excise, is infuit.ng and de
lusory to a free people.
The Secretary-has the honor of being dif

feenin iociety, and to whose d:lcretion he would
not tiu(l his dog, for such mull be employed
when the law is fq difag-reeable to men of prin

be entered on record in the excileman's office,
whether ihev be defigried for lale, for diflilling,
or other domestic uses, under the penalty of tor

tx poft-facto law with refpoft to thole stills thai
are already in polfeffion ? is it not inconsistent
witn the constitutional right of holding and dil
pofit.g ofprivaic pioperty ? but this is not all,
the secretary has conceived the idea, and has
been L;old enough to recommend it to the le
gislature, to ohli f e the freemen of the United
States to be feivants to the excifcrnen, in affifl
ing them to measure the stills. or pay a com
pensation. no doubt at the discretion of the ex
cifcman too (fee page 20). Doe; the feceetary
indeed conceive that he is dittaung laws to a na
tion of Haves. ? or has he forgot that we are the
fame people who, not twenty years ago, with
the pride of freemen, made the awful appeal tc
arms, rather than fubrnit to fiiackles less odious
and Jess degrading thati an excise ? is it noi
enough for him to oppress a dcfeiving part ol
the community, without them ? I will
los waile time with arguments on this fubjeft;
the people of the United S ares will never bt
fcrvanu at discretion to excifcrnen, nor to any
other cflicial chara&ers, no, not even to the
fecewrv hi rule If.
Havng honeilly dated the situation and cir
cumflances of the difiiilers of home produce,
and the buuhens and reftriÂ£lious itnpofed or
them by the excise law, and also those about tt
be impoftd, I now appeal to every difinterefl
ed citizen, 1 appeal to the members of the fede
ral legiHature, I appeal to all not blinded, with
prejudice, nay, I appeal to the fecrerary of the
trealury himfelf, in those moments when he
diveffs himfelf of the projeÂ£hng financier, te
judge whether the excise law does not discourage
honefl and necessary indullry, and interfere with
the bufmefs of diflilling, and whether the pro
posed regulations are not an intolerable in-full
to the feelings of freemen. I appeal to hus
bandmen who live by agriculture in moic hap
py lituations than the western woods ; I ast
them with fenous anxiety, how they would fub
nut to such burthens and rei.ri&ions on the pro
duce of their farms, prepared in such a mannei
as to be mod suitable for their comfort and pro
fit : if they countenance such ineafures, at fc
early a period of our national exiftence 7 to bt
dealt out -to their less fortunate brethren, le j
them also beware, for their day-is coining.
Free citizens ought to be giiarded against the
most diHant approaches of such arrange men.'s,
as not only would in a parual manner diminifl
their property, but sap the Very foundations o!
liberty and virtue. Let it be remembered, thai
the most effe&unl way to enlure the general pro
gress of such mischievous measures, is to attack,
in the full instance, such manufactures as art
likely to be supported but bv few advocates, ir
the public councils of the nation, immediate!)
interfiled in patronizing them. Remote evils
in the political as well as physical world, are toe
apt to be neglctted or delpsied ; but the wounc
which produces the fligbteff mortification of tht
extremities, extending insensibly unto the othei
part?, contaminates and at length deOroys the
whole fun&ions of the heart, it is a lule, veri
fied by experience, that when any local part o
a nation conceive themselves to be opprelfed b)
the government, they either fuccefsfully refif
the tyranny, as the United States have done in
their revolt fiom Great-Britain, or what is more
common, thevaidthe firong arm of oppreflion
in laying burdens equally heavy on their fellow
citizens.
It will, no doubt, he thought that my (late
mcnts, on this lubj< are too much detailed
anp the fiTme facts put into too many points o
view ; I lurely would have thought so myfelf 0!
luch a performance, before the excise law waj
enaÂ£ied, and particularly before the report o
the secretary on that fubjeft ; but when I ob
lerve, not only such a total ignorance of the
slate of this domestic manufa&ure displayed ir:
that report, bur an elaborate exercise of ingenu
ity to nnflead those who have not a peifona
knowledge of the circumstances and the faÂ£ls ;
and when I fee that too many in Congrcfs de
pend upon the ininifter s statements, aÂ» if they
were records whose veracitv could not be con
troveited, embrace his principles as if they were
evangelically just, and have recourse to his ar
guments as to authorities moftfacred ; to be mi
nute is neceflaiy to the cftabhfhment of truth,
and is at once the duty and the apology of him
who undertakes the arduous talk.

We are happy to contradict, in part, the

From good authority that captain Paul who
is stationed on the south weft frontier of
Walhington county', Pennfyivania, has erec
ted a very strong block-house on the Dhd

Mr. Ryerfon's mills, from %vhence he
makes almost daily cxciirfions over the
neighbouring ground,; by his vigilance,
â¢ind the co-operation of his subaltern offi

slock houses, one on his left, the other on
air. right, each at a few miles distance, it i?
expected he wijl completely thwart the
Jefigns of any fmail parties of the savages
:hat may approach that part of our fron

Besides those Indians which carrifed off
md scalped the two boys mentioned in our
ast, there are evident signs of several small
xirties having prowled along the fouth
â¢veft frontier of Washington and Ohio
:ounties, particularly on Whelen, weft of
.he Pennsylvania boundary.
Friday the 13th instant, arrived here the
Western Experiment, Captain Nicholfon.
She is bound to New-Orleans, from thence
with a cargf) to Philadelphia; was built
about tixty miles up the Monougahela, bur
then about 60 tons, and draws 8 feet of

An accidental event occurred at Ea!:y.

thf furrow, with a large brake harrow of thirty
feeth j winter barley was then Town and harrowed
in. The last winter was wet and open, and
therefore severe on the grain, and sct5 ct this field
turned out better th:-n most in the neighborhood.
From my observations on this crop, I believe that
"rr iÂ» better hufoandry to cross-plough, as in expe
riment No. J. than to trust to the harrow alone.
To continue clover more than three years is not
profitable j the fourth yea;'of the clover was full
of weeds.
Experitntpt 3.
Field eight acres ; foil clay and wet
corn, rye, corn, buck-wheat, is bad hulbandrv,
except in the present cafe, intended meiely to
make manureâComing in pofleliion of a large
farm, every part of which was exhausted, I could
only manure a part of it time, and there
fore it was good managc-mrfk -to procure any pro
duce, for the fake of cattle to make
manure. November, the buck-wheat
flubble was ploughed, and in April, 1788, the
field was covered with fifteen loads of dung to the
acre, and sown with spring barley ; the crop
twenty bufliels to the acre. After two plough
ings, winter barley was sown, which did not pro
duce more than ten buiheis to the acre. Imme
diately after harvest put in buck-wheat, clover
and timothy j in April last iix bufhcls of gypsum
per acre, was strewed over the young clover j at
harvest the produce three tons of good hay to the
acre.
Experiment 4.
Field fix acres ; foil clay, with a small quan
tity of gravel. In April, 1790, this field was
sown with clover feed and strewed with fix buih'
els of gypsum to the acre on the young wheat 3
the clover at present looks well.
Experiments 5, 6, and 7,
Were made on a light loam, to discover the
best preparatory crop te> grain,, The result was
greatly in favor of the potatoes.
Experiment 8.
Field two acres j foil, loam with some clay.â
In November, 2757, the clover lea was ploughed
eight inches deep, in April, 1788, it was well
harrowed and sown with spring barley the crop
â¼ery poor, evidently owisg to the want of foil.
Winter fallowed and in 1759, was planted with
potatoes. This year it produced two valuable
crops, one of flax, and the other turnips.
Experiment 9.
Field one acre j foil, loam with some clay.â
Jn May, 17S8, the clover lea was covered with
stable manure, and ploughed under five inches
deep j planted potatoes under every third furrow j
the crop at firft appeared promising, but after
wards grass took place, and the foa not being
rotted, the plough could not be used, Wefides the
grass came ap In the interstices between the po
tatoes in the rows j at harvest the potatoes were
numerous, but so small as not in general to be
merchantable. I am perfe&ly fatisficd that to
have a good crop of any vegetable, it is neceflary
to have the ground in the most meliorated state
poflible.
Experirr.cr.t 10.
Field ten acres j foil, loam. In 1789, af
ter having feeurrd the tops and blades of the
corn j and the corn being taken to the barn in
the hu/ks, the fta!ks were cut at the ground and
taken into the barn-yard to make manure. The
field was ploughed the firft week in December,
and in May, 1790, ploughed a second time, and
eight acres planted with potatoes. In Odtober
the potatoes were gathered, and the vines being
colle&ed with a light harrow were hauled into the
barn-yardâthe ground was then ploughed and
sown with wheat, which at present looks well.
The remaining two acres was covered with dung
and ploughed twice during the summer to prepare
it for wheat which was sown at the fame time
with the potatoe ground. This experiment, in
tended to discover whether potatoes, or a clean
summer fallow was the best preparative to a grain
crop. At this time the potatoe ground has the
best appearance. I examined some of the plants
of wheat whilst in the feed leaf, and found their
roots to extend fix and eight inches ; an evident
mark of the advantages of deep ploughing, and ha
ving your ground in good tilth.
Experiment 11.
Field fix acres j foil, light loam. The clover
produced two good crops, in 1788, one
crop and pasture, in 1789, excellent pasture for
cattle, Iheep and hogs, until September, when it
was ploughed eight inches deep, and after being
well harrowed it was sown with winter barlevâ
the crop twenty-five bufiieb to the acre. Imme
diately after harvest the stubble was ploughed un
der, and in O&ober was again ploughed, and
sown with wheatâthe crop has a very promising
appearance.
Experiment 12.
Field one acre ; foil, loam, a little wer, with a
clay bottom. In 1788, produced two excellent
crops of hay, and nearly as good the year follow,
jng. In O&ober, the clover lea was ploughed
four inches deep, the sod crumbling to pieces be
fore the plough ; after being well harrowed it was
sown with winter barley 5 a wet, open winter, de
tfroyed so much of the crop, that I was induced
io plough the ground in April, and to sow spring
barley and clovcrâthe barley as good as most this
4'eafonâthe clover looks well.
Experiment 13.
A field of the size and quantity of the last expe
riment, and treated in a similar manner, except
that it was sown with wheatâthe crop was not
injured by the winter, and produced twenty bufh
cls to the acre. Wheat appears a hardier grain
than barley, and therefore /hould have a prefer
ence where a farmer it uncier the necsflky offow
ing late.
Experiment 14.
Field fix acres ; foil, wet loam. After remo
ving the corn-ftaiks into the barn-yard, winter
fallowed the ground, and in April 1789, ploughed
in twenty loads of dung to the acre, for spring bar
ley. During the summer 1 added three acres of
ftcfti land taken in from an adjoining wood, and
which had been cleared the preceding winter.
Soil the fame as the above fix acres, covered with
a rich black mould j ploughed this new ground
I'ircc t;.râ ;:Â» Septeir.Ler, the old and new
ground were sown the fame day, with wheat ; du
ring the autumn both crops appeared promiiing j
ihe following fpting the three acre.Â® was almost to
tally dtftruyed by a long wet winter. At harvest
the old ground produced twenty-live bufiiels to the
acre} the new ground not fix. This field having
an under stratum of*ciav, and the roots of the
uees preventing a proper depth of the ploughing,
jccafioned the water toftagnate about the roots cf
the wheatâio the ojd fieid a de;>th of plowing of
right inches prevented this mifchier. The prin
cipal objedl of this experiment was to discover,
whether old exhausted fields, under proper ma
nagement, would not produce equal to the bert
new ground. In this instance the wet season was
3jainit the experiment.
We may observe, with great truth, that the un
rertainty Â»f th* seasons, and the length of time
equired to make agricultural experiments, renders
t difficult to make them with accuracy. In a
looting and pursuing the rotation of crops, found
â d upon the experiments now recited, it will be
leceffary to attend ftri<fl 1v to forne points on which
he success of the rotation depends.

As the natural flrength of the foil is exhausted,
Â»v constant cropping, without manure, and as the
iorfe , cows, and other stock, which any farm
an maintain within itfelf, will not actor d a fufii
iency of manure for an annual supply to the
vhole farm, we have therefore been induced to
onfider the proposition of your very ufeful society,
n its mod extensive sense, as intended so acquire
1 knowledge of a rotation of crops calculated, to
ifford-â
1 ft. The greatest number of profitable cropsâ
2d. The greatest qaantity of fpdder to winter
rattleâ
3d. The greatest length of time between manu
ing the fame fieldâand
4th. Such a variety of crops as may not inter
ete with one another, but by coming in regulai
uccefllon may afford the farmer and his family
:he most constant employ.
No one of the rotation of crops, which I have
flntioried will answer these objects, and therefore
:annot merit the attention of the fociety.âUnin
formed and destitute of proper guides, I made
:hefe experiments to discover the truth j and as
:hey have led to the knowledge of a rotation of
rrops, which is perfe&lv fads factory to myfelf, J
thought it neceiiary to submit the whole to youi
consideration, to enable you to judge of the foun
dation of that rotation which J now offer.
Rotation cf Crcps,
I. Indian corn j 2, potatoes and flax ; 3, wheatj
;|, winter barley, and after the barley, buckwheat,
with clovcr and timothy j 5, clover, two crops ft
; 6, clover, one crop, for hay and palture ; 7j
pasture j 8, wheat j 9, winter bailey.
This plan constitutes my present mode of farm
ng and the success attending it, leaves no room
;o doubt of its superior advantage. To pursue ik
:o the greatest polfiÃle profit, within the abihtj
)f one familyâthe farm ihould confiftof 180 acres
jf land, fubjett to thi? rotation, besides woodland,
srehard, &c. &c. A farm thus regulated would
produce annuallyâ
20acrcs of Indian corn.
10 acres of potatoes.
10 acres of flax'.
40 acres of wheat.
40 acres of winter barley.
20 acres of clover, two crops.
20 acres of clover, one crop, and pasture until
November.
20 acres of clover pasture, until September.
10 acres of buckwheat with clover on the bar
ey ftubbh'.
Indian corn is a valuable crop on account of
ts grain : it is also valuable on account of the
/cry nourishing food afforded by its tops, cut as
ye-ftraw, and mixed with potatoes. I have
ong been in the practice of making potatoes a
principal food for my horses and cattle. Our
lieep and hogs will fatten rapidly on them, for
he latter they should be boiled. P'lax conltitutes
1 valuable article too much neglected by our
rountry. An annual produce of eighty acres of
wheat and barley, and forty acres of the best clo
ser and timothy hay, out of one hundred and
eighty acres, under cultivation, must be efteem
â¢d good farming. This produce would enable a
armer to winter fifty head of stock, besides sheep j
jy which, and a proper system of barn-yard ma
lagemeot, he might every year make five k'an-
Ired loads of good manure. I have fou**,d great
Â»dvant,ige in keeping the milch covrs, hogs and
heep, in the yard, during the fummcr j fome
imes giving them dovcr, cut green ; and at all
:imes, during ihe year, bringing home every kind
Df trash which will make manure ; on this ac
:ount the corn-stalks and potato-vines are very
ufeful. Leaving a large furface of these sub
stances exposed, during the winter, in the barn
yard, the cold would prevent them from becom
ing manure j therefore, the firft week in Decem
ber, or earlier, if necessary, the yards fhouid be
:leaned up, and the half-decayed weeds and trash,
?f every k;nd, put in a heap near the field yeu in
tnd to manote. I have been particular on the
Ã¼bjed of manure, because the success of the ro
ation depends on a full supply of it.
Turnips, rye and oatfi, arc not mentioned, be
aufe the severity of our winters render the firft
in impropercrop for the farmer, hefides they are
>y no means equal to the potato for feeding of
attle. Rye and oats are not of equal value with
'â¢'heat and corn, and therefore a preference is
;iven to the latter.
One object of a rotation of crops, is t.->giv<
conitanc ai d steady employ to the farmer and In
family, without fullering one business to inter
fere with another. 'I lie rotation popoled wil
answer this intention. Flax, corn, and pota
toes, will occupy the monrh* of April and Ma;
ihe firft hay harvest, the month of June j bar
ley and wheat in July j barley is natural, earlic,
than wheat, and being sown earlier, it may b.
got out of the harvefl: field before t e wheat is si
to be cut. After harvest comes the feeding U>
buck-wheat and grass j the 1 cond hay harvest
ieed:r.g for barley and wheat j winter following
and during the severity ot winter, trelhing ou
grain.
On account of the time and flock, requirei t
conduit a farm, fubjedt to the rotation of crop
how propoled, it mud appear evident, that it i
not calculated for a poor tenantry, but lor an in
dependent yeomanryâsuch as our American fur
mers ought to beâgentlemen cultivating thei
own ellates, and living under the protection of
just and enlightened government. In this fitua
tion the indultrious husbandman ploughs his fie IJ
with pleasure and alacrity, well knowing tha

j roportion of the net produce|of his farm, he v> il

wretched principles of fifcaJity, and deriving it

So intimately is the agriculture of a counts
:on netted with its government, that it always as
loidi the best criterion of its excellence.
Air. Poivre, a celebrated French philofophe
and traveller, after giving a particular accoun
of the Itate of agriculture in Africa and Asia
fays, addrefling himfelf to his readers, " call t<
mind what 1 have said refpetting the laws, cuf
torns, aid manners of the different nations o
Africa and Asia ; where I have examined th
liate of agricultureâCompare one nation with a
no,her, judge if trie unhappy MaJabars, withou
property, and fubjeft to the arbitrary will of
despot j if a people of Haves always bending un
der the iron sceptre of the king of Siam j if th
nati.n of Malayeans for ever agitated and op
prelled by feodal laws j can, even whilst pofleflin
the belt lands in the world, enjoy an agricultur
as flourilhing as the people of China, govcrne
as one family, and fubrnitting to the laws c
reason. âThis fame enlightened traveller fu.
ther observesâ (t I will then assert with const
dence, that in every country in the world, th
state of' agriculture depends I'olely upon the eita
blifhed laws and customs of the country."*â
Agricultural societies have long been tftiblifhu
in the different parts of Franceâpremiu;ns hav
b*en offered by those societies to all who excel
ed in cultivating the ground j and yet, owing t
the nature of that government, and the difljpate
manners of the court, by which the whole couii
try was infettedâagricu Iture has been for man
veais in a langui/hing lituation. That kingdom
which under the administration of the great Su.
ly, exported grain to its neighbors, lince hi
time has frequently wanted bread.
Where is the encouragement to agriculture I
this country, opprdfed with the mod auinou
lyitem of indirect taxation and coTirnerciai
lations, and overwhelmed with lcenes of paraue
extravagance and difiipation.
The improved lyftem of English hufuandry
solely conlilts in fubltituting a crop of clover, i
the place i f an unproductive fallow.
As frequent manuring is a very expensive ope
fation in agriculture, the farmers in
were formerly in the practice, after tak.ng tw
or three crops from a field, to leave it walte so
leveral )ears j by which a poor palture was fur
nilhed for their cattle, and the vigor of the foi
was, in a ImaJl degree, renewed by an annual de
cay ol weeds. This is, at pre fen t, the plan o
conducting the farms in many paits of that coun
try, and is universally the cale in this.
By fubft:tuting clover, for an unproductive sal
low, the farmer procures a valuable crop of hay
and the molt luxuriant pasture, belides which
the ground becomes meliorates for a crop o
wheat. The foundation of the improved En
yiilh method of hufbaadry, and the foundatioi
of the rotation of crops, recommended to th
society, is the fame.
If the objcCt of the society was merely to havi
it afcertaincu by a couife of experiments, whethe
an exaCt imitation of the Engiilh mode of farm
ing, would be fuccefsful in this country, th<
13th experiment is a complete anlwer in favor o
luch questionâPotatoes, barley, clover, whea:
is one of the mod approved courses of crops i
that country. The rotation of crops which
had recommended to the patronage of" the fociet)
I, think, is superior to any hitherto pratlifeo
and that on two accounts :
jft. upon breaking up the clover lea, ir
the Method two valuable
of winter grain is prcCurec, in the place of one
according to the English mode of farming, and
2dly. Because by the plan proposed, a greate
number of valuable crops is pre.cured, and alio.;
greater length of time is acquired between thi
periods of manuring, which is a very expenlive
but highly necefl'ary part of farming.
Seven years of close and attentive observations
enabled me to Jay the foregoing experiments be
