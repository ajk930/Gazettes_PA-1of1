LIBERTY of the PRESS.
Translated ExtraEl from M, Robefpierre\
fpt&h in thz National Affcmbly, on th

THE liberty of the Press is the onl)
iffeÂ£tu#l check of arbitrary power, Th<
:onfequcnce\has been, the uniform en
ieavour of all such governments so tc
nterpret this liberty, as finally to ren
ier it a mere nullity. The moment of ;
-evolution is perhaps a time the leaf
"eafonable for difcuiTing the great prin
:ipies upon which the liberty of thâ¬
jrefs is founded, bccaufe at such a timÂ«
l! 1 parties of men are the fubje&s of th<
ittacks of the prels from one quarter oi

Full extent of liberty it ought to haveâ
But, let it be the glory of the Nationa
Aflembly of France' to be above preju
dice and to disregard all personal con
federationsâthis is the example that ha:
t>een set before us by the United State:
America, on the great question of th<
liberty of the prels.âThe liberty o
publ'fhing our sentiments is the greai
bulwark of liberty, and can only be li
rfited, even in the smallest degree, b)

where the author of any piece is liabh
:o arbitrary prosecutionâand here ]
will observe, that there is an elfentia
iifference between criminal aUs and th<
fffcnccs of the. press.âCriminal aÂ£lion:
ire of a palpable and sensible nature,
rhey can be proved in conformity tc
:ertain established rules and by infalli-
methods, after which the law can
:ake its course without any mixture oi
arbitrary proceeding. As to mere opi
nions, puolifhed to the world, their me
rits or their criminality must always de
pend upc*u rational principles, justice,
and public intercifc, and often-times up
on- a multitude of peculiarcircum fiances.
which are neceflarily productive of great
uncertainty. The moll particular cir
cumfpeftion, therefore, is necessary in
naking laws to regulate the liberty of
he pressÂ» Laws expressly enacted to
ecuts the liberty of the press have al
ways, in the end, proved the infallible
neans of annihilating it. Recollett,
Gentlemen, what has passed under the
ate French government : under pre
enceof public good, writers, especially
political writers, lived a life of perfeeu
iioti and misery from those whose duty
t was to proteO: them. What were the
writings, which, prior to the revoluti
an, were the objects of such marked fe
yerity ?âThe very writings which
we at this day admire, and whose au
thors have been thought worthy the ho
mage of the nation. A proof this, that
ime and situation alone determine whe
;her an author fliall be perfccuted or be
;rowned with honour. Only three
,'ears ago the Social Compacl, was con
demned as a treasonable work. John
[ames RoufTeau, the man who did the
noft tp bring about the present revolu
ionâthat very John James Roffeau,
.vasby adecreeof the nation, pronounc
:d a traitor, a man of dangerous princi
jles, a seditious pestâ-and nothing pre
sented his neck being brought to the
>lock, but the fears the government be
jan to entertain, in the latter part of his
;ime, of the couragc of the patriotic par
:y in France.âBut even at this late pe
riod, if despotism had only known her
remaining strength and influence over
he nation, existing by the force of long
labitâRouflcaus'head would have paid
or the ferviceshe rendered to mankind,
ind he would have addedone to the num
>er of the illuflrious vi&ims whom fa
laticifm, delpotlfm and tyranny have al
ways considered as too dangerous to
heir cause to be fufFered to live. Be
iflured, then, Gentlemen, that nothing
s of a more delicate nature, perhaps no
hing is more impossible, than to make
in equitable law to infli& penalties, for
he opinions which men may publish,
specially on those matters which are
he natural obje&s of human reason,
inowledge and enquiry. What you.
lave done, is all that can be done in this
:afc ; and that is, to consider him as a
criminal, who plainly and explicitly
not by any kind of implication] oifends
igainft the spirit of the law.
Further than this you cannot go with
aut infringing the liberty of the press
in its essential properties and princi
ples.

From, a late French. Paper. I
TO those who read history it must be
Fatiguing to observe the odious confe
rences of dijiindion of birth with all
nations who have fuffered such dillinc-*-
rions to prevail among them. We may
however, gratify our risible faculties
when wc cast an eye upon the ridicule
which has attended those diflin&ions.
Hereditary honours have ever been
food for the pen of the satirist, becaufc
:hey are absurd in their very princi
ples.
The eflfcnce of family diftin&ion de
pends upon the feudal law. The mo
ment it falls under the view of the laws
sf equity and nature it is annihilated.
What then shall we think of hereditary
honaurs and titles being put up at sale ?
When we fee a man, composed of the
jafefl materials [provided he has only
tiad low cunning enough to amass a for
:une] purchasing afterwards, as it were
in the market house, the right of be
aming the founder of a noble race, and
anticipating among his defendants,
lords, dukes, and peers !
The best method to restore those per
rons to their senses who are admirers of
titles, and all the nonsense of quality
and nobility, would be to recapitulate
the quarrels of Princes with their legal
defcondants ; the disputes of these with
Numb. 15.the Dukes, and of the. Dukes, again with
the gentry. la Â«11 thcfc contests, the
truth alwiiys cajne out, that the sceptred
and titled men were the meanest of men ;
not so from nature, but from education
and habits which had left little ot no
thing to their tjwn exertions ; -for f.rQc
greatness is always acquired and irribib
ed in the severe ichool of necessity. In
the mod superstitious nations of the
earth, iittlfe inert, [in reality such] W-ere
always fond of being thought gods, a'nc!

Observations written pojteri'or to tk'.
circular Address p/ Gon-cuessiuSept.
arid priur to their A3, of March,
1780.]
1.1 has been taken for an axiom in all our rea-
Toniagsbn the fubjett of ffnaflee, that sup
posing the quantify and demand of things vendi
ble in a countiy iq remain the fame, their piice
Vary according to the variation in the quan
;ity of the circulating medium; in other words,
hat the value of money will be regulated By its
quantity. I shall submit to the judgment of the
jublic some considerations which determine mine
o reject the proportion as founded in error.
Should they be deemed not absolutely conclulive,
hey seem at leall to fhe'w that it is liable to too
many excepfioris and reltoÂ£tion's to be taken for
panted as a fundamental truth".
If the circulating medium be of universal va
ue as specie, a I'ocal increase or decrease of its
quantity, will not, whilst a communication fub
ills with other countries, produce a correfpond
-snt rife or fall in its value. The reason is obvi
3Us. When a redundancy of universal money
prevails in any one country, the holders of it
snow* their interest too well to watte it in extra
vagant prices, when it w:uld be worth so much
more to them elsewhere. When a deficiency
happens, thole who hold commodities, rather
ban part with them, at an undervalue in one
:ountry, would carry them to another. The va
riation of prices, in these cases, cannot therefore
exceed the expence and insurance of traiifpoita
ion.
Scppofe a country totally unconnected with
Europe, or with any other country, to pofTefs
pecie in the fame proportion to circulating pro
perty that Europe does ; prices there would cor
â¢efpqnd with, those in Europe. Suppose that
0 much specie weie "thrown into circulation a3
:o make the quantity exceed the proportion of
Europe tenfold, without any change in commo
dities, or in the demand for them : as soon as
uch an augmentation had produced its
prices would rife tenfold ; or which is the fame
hing, money would be depreciated tenfold. In
his (late of things; fuppol'e again, that a free atid
ready communication were opened between this
:ountry and Europe, and that the inhabitants of
the former, were made sensible of the value of
theil- money in the latter; would not its value
among themselves immediately cease to be regu
lated by its quantity, and aflimiiate itfelf to the
foreign value r
Mr. Hume in his discourse 011 the balance of
trade supposes, tf that if four fifths of all the mo
ney in Britain were annihilated in one night, and
:he nation reduced to the fame condition, in this
particular, as in the reigns of the Harrys and
Edwards, that the price df all labour and commo
dities wotlld fink in proportion, and every thincr
be fold as cheap as in those ages : That, '
if aH the money in Britain were multiplied five
fold in one night, a contrary effe6t would follow."
1 his very ingenious writer seems not to have
considered that in the reigns of the Hariys and
Edwards, the state of prices m the circumjacent
nations correfoonded with that of Britain ; where
as in both ot his suppositions, it would be nolefs
ibfcn four filths different. Imagine that such a
difference really existed, and remark the confe
rence . I rade is at present carried on between
Britain and the red of Europe, at a profit of 15
Dr 20 per cent. Were that profit railed to 400
per cent, would not their home market, in cafe
?f such a tall of prices, be so exhausted by ex
portation-âand in cafe of such a rife of prices, be
io overflocked with foreign commodities, as im
mediately to restore the general equilibrium.
Now, to borrow the language of the fame author,
'' the fame causes which would redress the ine
quality were it to happen, mufl forever prevent
t, without lome violent external operation."
1 he situation of a country connected by com
mercial intercourse with other countries, may be
zompared to a fingte town or province whose irt
.ercourfe with other towns and provinces results
om poetical connexion. Will it be pretended
that if the national currency were to be accumu
lated in a (ingle town or province, so as to exceed
its due proportion five or tenfold, a correspond
ent depreciation would ensue, and every thing be
told five or ten times as dear as in a neighboring
town or province ?
If the circulating medium be a municipal one,
as paper currency, still its value does not depend
dl its quantity. It depends on the credit of the
Rate iliuing it, and on the time of its redemption;
and is no otherwise afFeftted by the quantity, than
as the quantity may, be luppofed to endanger orpojl
pone the redemption.
1 hat it depends in part on the credit of the if
(uer, no one will deny. If the credit of the lfluer
therefore be perfe&ly unfufpe&ed, the time of
redemption alone will regulate its value.
1 o lupport what is here advanced, it is fuffici
ent to appeal to- the nature of paper money. It
confmi ot bills or notes of obligation payable in4>e..s to the bearer, either on demand or at a fu
ture day. Of the firft kind is the paper curren C)
of Britain, and hence its equivalence tc specie,
Of the latter kind is the paper currency of the
United States, and hence its inferiority to specie
But if its being ledeemable not on demand bu
at a future day, be the cause of its inferiority
the distance of that day, and net its quantity
ought to be the measure of that inferiority. .
It has been thewn that the valce'of specie doe
not flu&uate according to local fluctuations it
its quantity. Great Britain, in which there i;
such an iinmenfity of circulating paper, (hew;
that the value of paper depends as little on it:
quantity as that of specie, when the paper repre
tents specie payablton demand. Letusfuppofe
that the circulating notes of Great Britain, in
ilead of being payable on demand, were to be
redeemed at a future day, at the end of one yeai
for example, and that no interest was due or
them. If the fame assurance prevailed that at th<
end of the year they would be equivalent to fpe
c-e, as now prevails that thev are every momen
equivalent, would any other effect result frorr
such a change, except that the notes would (uffei
a depreciation equal to one year's interest ? The)
would in that cafe repiefent, not the nomina
sum expieffed on the face of them, but the fun
remaining after a deduÂ£lion of one year's inter
est. But if when they represent the full nomi
nal sum of specie, their circulation contribute;
eo more to depreciate them, than the circulatior
of the specie itfelf would do ; does it not follow
that it they repiefented a sum of specie less thai
the nominal inlcriptiofi, their circulation ough
to depreciate them no more than fomuch specie
if substituted, would depreciate itfelf ? We ma]
extend the time from one, to five, or to twentj
years , but we shall find no other rule of depre
ciation than the loss of the intermediate interest
What has been here supposed with refpetl tc
Great Britain has actually taken place in the Uni
ted States. Being engaged in a neceflary wai
without Ipecie to defray the expence, or to sup
poit paper emiflions for that purpose redeemable
on demand, and beingat the fame time unable
to borrow, no resource was left, but to emit bill:
ot credit to be redeemed in fu:ure. The infe
ricrity of these bills to specie was therefore inci
dent to the very nature of them. If they hac
been exchangeable on demand for specie, they
would have been equivalent to it: as they weri
not exchangeable 011 demand, they were inferio
to it The degree of theij inferiority must con
fequently be e'.limated by the time of their be
coming exchangeable for specie, that is the tim<
of their redemption. -
To make it liill more palpable that the value o
our currency does not depend on its quantity, lei
us put the cafe, that' Congrcfs had, during the
firft year of the war, emitted five millions of dot
larsto be redeemed at the end of ten years; that
during the second year of the war, they had emit
ted ten millions more, but with due security tha
the whole fifteen millions {hould be redeemcc
in five years ; that, duting the two fucceedinj
years, they had augmented the emissions to one
hundred millions, but from the difcoVerv of some
extraordinary fouices of wealth, had been able
to engage for the redemption of the whole furr
in one year: It is atked, whether the deprecia
tion, under these circumftauces, would have in
created as the quantity of money increafedâo
whether on the contrary, the money would no
have risen in value, at every accession to it
quantity P

RICHMOND, Dcc. 9.
topyof a Utter from Capt. John Rogers, to his Ex
ccllerccy Htniy Lee, Esq. dated R'oad 12 miles caj
qj New London, Campbell county, Aov. 26.
" On my way from Spanish Americ:
across by land, I passed the Kentuck)
country* where a few days after my at
rival, and three days previous to my de
parture from thence (which was on the
15th instant) we received certain intel
ligence of the defeat of our army undei
the command of general St. Clair. Il
does not appear that the army were ta
ken by surprise, as the centinels fircc
above sixty (hots atjhe enemy before
the atlion came on ; during which time
I Xuppofe.the veterans of the fejreft were
taking their position; as it appears thS)
had completely surrounded the army
and attacked it on all fides at day break
tomahawk in hand against bayonets
They twice surrounded St. Clair's tent
being, (as he generally is) to ill with the
gout, that he could not get out until he
was set on horleback, and then conduct
ed the retreat. The Indians fought the
army five miles on their retreat; anc
were prevented from tomahawking the
General in his tent by the vigilance oi
the troops who defended it. The battle
was fought thirty miles from fort Jeffer
fon, and fifteen miles from the ground
on which Harmar was- defeated. Iht
remains of the arfny are in the above
named fort, and have only twelve dayj
provisionS, the ilefh of pack horses.
Xhe Indians appeared in force around
the fort the next day. St. Clair passed
on himfelf to the next fort about sixty
miles from fort Jefferfon, where it is laid
he is waiting assistance to .relieve the
fort. All the leading charadters in
Kentucky are turning out, and it was
thought that a body of 1500 or 2000
horsemen would go to the relief of the
army. The Mountain Leader, a Chick
afaw, with a part of his nation, and a
part of the Ift regiment, were out on
command, iaid to have been ordered to
lome small town.â I here is no word of
them ; it is generally feared they will be
:ut off, as they could know nothing of
:he defeat of the army. There was a
ccond party Ox the Chiekafaw nation
jnder tne great leader Colbert, on their
way to join our army, but had not reach
id it; they will go on with the relief.
I"nere was only one Indian of that na
:ion in this a&ion, who it is laid killed
ind scalped eleven of the enemy with
lis own hands, and engaging with the
12th, he fell greatly lamented by the
Americans. General Butler was, wound
ed, and carried to his tent to have his
wounds drefTed; an Indian watched
where "he was carried to, then broke
:hrough our men, and tomahawked the
general and the doctor who was drefling
lis wounds, before he was killed by
Dur men. It is thought the whole of the
ofs, including the army and its follow
ers, amounts to 800 persons. The above
appears to be the general account as re
reived in Kentucky by sundry persons
Prom the army, generally corresponding,
md I believe may be relied on."

ight of the matter as to have entered into the

ExlraEl of a letterfrom Boson, Dec. 4.
" If our accounts from the southward are to be
lepended on, the spirit of Canal making is ad
vancing rapidly amongst the people of thole
lates.âA junction between the Hudson and Lake
Z)l\amplain is much talked ofâthe Delaware and
:he Sufquehanna Rivers, and the two bays of De
,aware and Chefapeke, it is said, will in all proba
bility be loon united. To these may be added the
Canal that is in contemplation between Santee and
Cooper Rivers in South Carolina. It is certain
that for a comparatively small expence the United
States-could open an easy communication by wa
ter from Boston to St. Marys Ri?er in Georgia,
for vessels of seven feet draught, without ever en
tering the main Ocean, except in a very few
places. The advantages of such a navigation, par
ticularly' in time of war are evident. âAs to our
felves,the iegiflature of this state has determined
to cut a canal across Cape Cod, irom Buzzards
bay into Barnftable bay. The diflance is not
more than eight ipiles, and the canal is to be ol
such a depth as to float veiTels, of any size under
three fathom draught. The expence is estimated
at one and twenty thousand pounds, this curren
cy ; an expence really not worth mentioning
when put in competition with the perpetual loflej
to the commerce of this fiate alone, in the danger
ous navigation round Cape -od, which by means of
this canal will be entirely avoided.âAnother ca
nal is in contemplation from the head of Taunton
river to North river,about miles south of Boston,
which will be of immense advantage particularly
to the trade between Boston and New-York. 1
Two laws have some time since been pafled for
.the diftridl of Maine,(commonwealth of Maflachu
fetts)pointedly severe against a vice, perhaps equal
ly fafhionable, tho' not equally the object of legal
reprehenfiort in situations more southward. One
of those laws ena&s that, " a lift of the names of
all persons reputed Common drunkards, tiplers,
gamesters, and such as mifpend their time and
eftate6 in gambling and tipling houses, fhail be
polled up in the houses and (hops of all tavern-kee -
pers, inn hoklers and rfetailers within that part ol
the country where they rcfide. ' âThe other law
Provides that, " common drunkards, such as ne
gled their callings or employments, mifpend what
they earn, and do not provide for themlelves and
their families, shall be lent to the house of cor
rection, or to the goal of the County, where no fuel]
house is ipecially provided.''
Accounts from Cape Francojs are received
(via Baltimore) to the 26th ol November. The
ravages of the negroes were Hill continued with
Unabated fury at that time. The account, how

without foundation.

As there arc cases where the public opinion

je iaid that the reuilÂ£iion of the army appears to

hat this partial reduction will change the rnafs
if fcveral corps destined to remain fta\ionary, but
or the present wiH produce but little or no changA

Â«ith surprize, that orders have been sent to the

The dispatches arrived from Bucharest relate
principally to the differences between the Ruffians

[Defcripthn cf bis Village.]
BESIDE a stream that never yet ran dry,
There stands a Town, not high advancec
in fame;
Tho' few its buildings, rais'd to please the eye,
Still this proud title it may fairly claim ;
A Tavern (its firft requisite) is there,
A flj j a black^fmitb's foop, a bouse cf prayer*
Nay, moreâa little market-house is seen
And iron hooks, where beef was never hung,
Nor pork, nor bacon, poultry fat or kan,
Pigs head, or sausage link, or bollock's tongue :
Look when you will, you iee the vacant bencil
No butcher teated there, no country wench.
Creat aims were his, who firft contriv'd this town
A market he would haveâbut, humbled now,
Sighing we fee its fabric mouldering down,
That only serves, at night to pen the cow :
And hence, by way of jelling, mat be said
That beef is there, tho 1 never beef that's dead.
A bread the innâa tree before the door,
A Printing-Office lifts its humble head
Where mailer Type old journals doth explore
For news that is thro' all the village read ;
Who, year from year, (so cruel is his lot)
Js author, prefiman, devilâand what not ?
Fame fays he is an odd and curious wight,
F-nd to diftratfion of this native place
In sense not very dull nor very bright,
Yet fliows some marks of humour in his face
One who can pen an anecdote, complete,
Or plague the parson with the mackled flieet.
Three times a week, by nimble geldings drawn
A fiage arrives } but scarcely deigns to flop,
Ur.lefc the driver, far in liquor gone
Has made some business for the black-smith-shop
Then comes this printer's harvell-time of news,
Welcome alike from Chrirtians, Turks, or Jews

PARIS, oa. 5 .
The manner in which the folemnit)
â of taking the oath to the conftitutior
â was conduced in the assembly made i
very intercfting. It marked the cha
rafter of the aflembly, for, in the fhor
difcuflion on the forms to be observed
there was an enthusiasm, an unanimity
and a patriotism, which afiure to the
nation the fidelity of their new lepre
fentatives, and that there is no likcli
hood of an attack being made on am
one of the glorious principles which ar<
established in France.
This morning the assembly commen
ced by a report which was made by thi
'vice-president, of the result of the de
putation sent to the king. M. Ducafte
laid, that having taken the opinion o
the deputation of what he fliould fay t<
the king, they went up to the palace a
fix o'clock in the evening. They fav
the minister of justice, who told then
that his majesty had appointed the nex:
day at one o'clock to receive the depu
tation. The vice-president stated t(
the minister, that it was of the utmofl
importance to the public affairs of the
empire, that the notice with which the)
were charged should be made knowr
to his majesty without delay, and the)
could not, consistent with their duty tc
the legislative assembly, postpone theii
commillion. The minister of jufticc
represented this to his majesty, whe
was pleased to appoint nine o'clock o
the fame evening to receive the deputa
tion. Accordingly, at nine o'clock,
they went up again, and were received
by his majesty in the council chamber,
when M. Ducaftel made his reverence,
and delivered his commission in the fol
lowing terms
" Sire,
" The national legislative assembly is
finally constituted, and we are appoint
ed a deputation to intimate this to your
majesty."
The king desired to know the names
of the deputation. The vice-president
told him that he had not a lift of their
names, and that in truth he did not
know them all.
His majesty was then pleased to fay
he would come in person to the affem
blv on Friday next. He was sorry he
Could Hot poflibly go there sooner.
This'report being made, the assembly
proceeded to receive the oaths of some
members, who had arrived after the
fitting of the day before.
Friday, OSober7.
This day the king came to the assem
bly, and, with as much'cheerfulnefs as
ever, delivered
A SPEECH,
so well calculated to restore harmony,
liiat it made a most lively impreflion
on their hearts. The acclamations
were as loud and as frequent as before,
and the king was vilibly equally grati
fied by his reception. It was in every
point the fame as on the 30th of Sep
tember. The following are close tranf-
lations of the speeches of the king and
the prelident ;
THE KIN"G's SPEECH.
" Gentlemen,
" ASSEMBLED by virtue of the
constitution to exercise the powers
which it delegates to you, you will un
doubtedly consider as among your firfl
duties, to facilitate the operations oi
government ; to confirm public credit :
to add, if poflible, to the fccurity of en
gagements of the nation ; to (hew thai
liberty and peace are incompatible
and finally, to attach the people to thei)
new laws, by convincing them thai
those laws are for their good.
'"Your experience of the effcÂ£ls o
the new order of things, in the fevera
departments from which you come
will enable you to judge of what ma)
be yet wanting to bring it to perfection
and make it easy for you to devise the
moll proper means of giving the necef
fary force and activity to the adminif
tration.
" For my own part, called by thf
constitution to examine, as firft repre
lentative of the people, and for theii
interest, the laws presented for mj
Tanftion, and charged with causing their
to be executed, it is also my duty tc
propose to you such objects, as I thinl
sught to be taken into confederation ii
;he course of your feflion.
" You will lee the propriety of fix
ing your immediate attention to the
[late of the finances, and you will fe<
:he importance of eftablilhing an equi
librium between the receipt and expen
diture, of accelerating the affeflmenl
and the colle&ion of taxes, of intrbdu
:ing an invariable order into all part:
if this vast administration, and thui
providing at once for the support ol
he Hate, and the relief of the people.
'â  Ihe civil laws will alio demanc
/our care, which you will have to ren
ler conformable to the principles of the
:onftitution. You will also have tc
amplify the mode of proceeding ir
:ourts of law, and render the attain
ment of justice more easy and mors
prompt.
" You will perceive the necessity o:
:ftablilhing a system of national educa
:iotl, and of giving a solid basis to pub
lic credit. You will encourage com
mcrce and industry, the ptogrefs oi
which has so great an influence on the
agriculture and the wealth of the king
dom ; and you will endeavor to make
permanent dispositions for affording
ivork and relief to the indigent.
" I lhall make known my firm deiirc
or the re-eftablilhment of order and
lifcipline in the army ; and I lhall ne
;leÂ£l no means that may contribute tc
eftore confidence among all who com
iofe it, and to put it into a condition
0 secure the defence of the realm. II
he laws in this refpeft are inefficient.
. lhall make known to you the meafurcs
hat seem to me to be proper, and you
vill decide upon them.
â  <1 I shall in the fame manner commu
licate my lentiments refpefcling the na
ry, that important part of the public
orce, destined to protefl trade and the
'olonies.
" We lhall not, I hope, be troubled
vith any attack from abroad. I have
aken, from the moment that I accepted
he constitution, and I still continue tc
ake, the steps that appear to me the
noft proper to fix the'wpinion of for
-ign powers in our favor, and to main
ain with them the good intelligence
:nd harmony that ought to lecure tou<
he continuance of peace. I expcci
he bell effeils from them ; but this ex-
Deflation does not prevent me froir
lurfuing, with activity, those measure:
if precaution which prudencc ought tc
dittate.
{Land, applauses o/" Vive le Roi !]
" Gentlemen, in order that your fm
'ortant labors and your zeal may pro
duce the eftefts expeÂ£led from them
it is necelTary that constant harmony
>nd unalterable confidence fliould reigr
between the legillative body and the
king [Renewed applaufa & acclamations
Ihe enemies of our rcpofe are but->tcc
lludious to disunite us ; the love of oui
country mull therefore rally us, and the
public interest render us infeparablt
[;warm applauses] Thus the public fore
will be exerted without oblWtion, the
administration will not be harraffed b-,
vain alarms, the property and the jeli
!j:on of every man will be equally pro
tected, and no pretext will be left foi
my perion to live at a distance from a
country where the law's are in vigor,
and men's rights rcfpefted.
" It is on this great basis of orde:
that the /lability of the confljtution.
the fucccfs of your labors, the fafety of
:he empire, the source of all kinds oi
3i ofperity mull depend. It is to this.
Gentlemen, that we all ought to turn
jur thoughts in this moment with the
Jtmoft poflible vigor ; and this is the
sbjeft that I recommend the most par
:icularly to your zeal and to your patri
3tifm."
'I he mojl lively tejlimonies of applause zi'cr<
riven to the king on this conduJion.'\
M. Prefiuent spoke as follows :
Sire,
" Your presence in the midst of u;
is a new engagement, which you take
owards the country. It is right thai
we should forget the confounded paw
:rs. A conflitution is established, and
â vith it the liberty of Frenchmen. You
jught to cherish it as a citizenâas kino
,'ou ought to maintain and defend it.â
Lnftead of violating, it ascertains youi
powerâlt has given as yaur friend:
ill those who formerly called them
selves only your fubjeds [here a burji oj
ipplauje]âYou have reason to be be
oved by FrenchmenâYou said so, fire
ome days ago in this temple of the
.ountry, and we have also reason tc
ove you [theplaudits were repeated]â
Ihe constitution has made you the firfl
nonarch in the world. Your love foi
t places your majeily in the rank o:
he mod favored kings, and the welfare
>f the people will make you the m6fl
lappy. May our mutual union make
is speedily feel its happy influenceâ
Jurify legislation, re-confirm public ere
lit, overthrow anarchy. Such is oui
lutyâfuch are our wishesâsuch are
'ours, fire. Such are our hopes, anc
he benedictions of Frenchmen will be
>ur reward."
The king went out in the fame man
ler that he entered, amidst the mofl
/ehement acclamations of Vive le Roi
md he was accompanied by the fame
ieputation.
On the motion of M. le Croix, the
peeches of the king and prcfident wen

of every citizen ceased to become for him an asy

fortrefs; if, in fine, all Frenchmen no longer re
garded themselves as guarantees for the support of
the civil liberty as well as their political liberty,
and for the religious execution of law j and if the
voice of the Magistrate, who spoke in his own
name, had not a force always superior to that of
millions of armed men.
" May a'l the diflinilions, all the blefiings of

them a gratitude, an attachment without bounds,
as were those testimonies of their confidence and
fnendfhip which I enjoyed during the revolution !
" Gentlemen, in ceasing to command you, a:
this painful instant of our separation, my heart,
penetrated with the most profound sensibility, feels
more than ever the immense obligations by which
I am attached to you. Receive the wiflies of your
most tender friend for the common prosperity, for
the individual happiness ot every one of you : and
may his remembrance always present to your

oath, which unites us all, to live free, or to
