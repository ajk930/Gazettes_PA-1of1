National AfTtmbly;conjidering
.-5. all new ideas, ot which the rnani
le flat ion or improvement may become ufe
ful to society, as belonging originally t;>
those who have conceived them ; and,
that it would be to attack the rights of
men in their ejjence, not to regard a diicu
very as the properly of the author, and
conlidering at the lame time, that tiie
want of Inch a pjfitive and authentic
truth until the present time, has much
cont ibuted to discourage the French m
dullry, as it has occalloued numbers oi
our moll diltinguifhed artists to emigrate
and has been the means bf numbers ot new
inventions being carried into foreign conn
tries, of which th s kingdwm ought to

[The following ExtraÃfrom Mr. Peine'>â  Rights
of M an, will give a tolerable idea whether ex
clusively privileged societies tend to the
general benefit of a country or net.J
On CHARTERS and CORPORATIONS.
IT is a perversion of terms to fay, that
a charter gives rights. It operates by a
contrary effect, that of taking rights aw?y.
Rights are inherently in all the inhabi
tants; but charters, by annulling those
rights in the majority, leave the right by
exclusion in the hands of a few. If char
ters were conftrufied so as to express in
direct terms, " that every inhabitant, who
is not a member of a corporation, (hall
not exetcife the right of voting." such
charters would in the face, be charters,
not of rights, but of exclusions. The ef
fect is the fame under the form they now
Numb. 73.
(land ; and the only persons on whom
they operate, are the persons whom they
exclude. Those whose rights are guaran
teed, by not being taken away, exercise
no other rights, than as members or the
community they are entitled to without a
charier ; and, therefo e, all charters have
no other than an indirect nega ve opera
tion. They'do not give rights to A, bui
they mike a difference in favour of A by
taking away the right of J', and cjL.e
quentlv are iufltumen o: injudicc.
Bui chart: >-s and corporations have a
more extensive evil effect, than wliat re
lates merely to elections. i hey are sour
ces of endless contentions in the places
where they exist ; and tuey leficn the
common lights of national Society. A
native of England, tin del the operation of .
charters and corporations, cannot be said
to be an Englishman in the full sense of
the word. He is not free of the nation,
in the fame manner that a Frenchman is
fret of France, and an Am erica'n of Ame
rica. His rights aie circumscribed to the
town, and, in iome cases, to the parish
of his birth; and ail o her parts, though
in his native land, are to him as a forei n
country. To acquire ; rcfidencein these,
lie mult undergo a lucal natural zation by
purchase, or he is forbidden or expelled
the place. This species of feudality is
k pt up to aggrandize the corporations
at the ruin of towns ; and ttie effedt is vi
iib'le.
The generality of corporation towns
are in a state of solitary decay, an,l pie
vented from further ruin on.y by fame
circumstance in their situation, such as a
navigable river, or a plentiful furiounding
country. As population is on â of the
chief fotirces of wealth, (for without it
land itfelf has no value) every thing which
operates to . rcve:U it ro. Jcfifsn the va -
lue of property ; and as corporations have
not only this tendency, but circtii y l] i* s
effedt, they cannot hut be injurious. If
anv policy were to be followed, instead
of that of general freedom to every perfou
to fettle where he cliofe (as in Fr nee and
America) it would be more confident to
give encouragement to new comers, than
to preclude their admifiion by exa&insj
*. r i
premiums from tnem.
The perfms moll imme iintely interest
ed in the abolition of corporations, are
the inhabitants of the towns where corpo
rat ons are established. The inltances of
Mjiichefter, Birmingham and Sheffield,
(hew, by contrail, the injury which those
Gothic inttitutions are to propert ad
commerce. A few examples may be found,
such as tiiat of London, v.hose natural
and commercial advantages, owing to its
situation on the Thames, is capable of
bearing up agamfl the political evils of a
corporation ; but in almost all other ca
ses fatality is too visible to be doubted
or denied.
Though the whole nation is not so di
rectly affected by the depreflion of pro
perty incorporation towns as the inhabi
tants themfeives, it partakes of the con
sequence. By leder.ing the value of pro
perty, the quantity of national commerce
is curtailed. Every man is a cullomer iu
proportion to his ability ; and as all parts
of a nation trade with each other, whate
ver affects any of the parts, mult necessa
rily communicate to the whole.
As one of the houses of the EngliiTi
parliament is, in a great measure, made
up of elections from those corporations ;
and as it is unnatural that a pure flream
should flow from a foul fountain, its vices
are but a continuation of the vipes of its
origin. A man of moral honor and good
political principles, cannot submit to the
mean drudgery and difgraceful arts, by
which such elections are carried. To b?
a fuccefsful candidate, he mud be defli
tute of the qualities that constitute a just
leg';flator â . and being thus disciplined to corrup
tion by the mode of entering into parliament, it
is not to beexpe&ed that the representative faoulJ
be better than the man.tor the National gazette.
i
TO THE PRINTER.
As you have published several ex'traib from 1
the New-York papers, refpe4ting the (
eleition forgovernor,andasfoine ofthofe .
Cxtraits relate to the conduit of the com
mittee appointed to canvals the votes,
you are re> piefted to publilh the following
circumfta ices, to prevent the readers 0}
your, or any other paper, forming erro- '
neou.i opinions by having only seen and j
â considered one fidp of the question.
IN the New York Journal of the 16th ult. 1
the builnefs of this election is fairly laid |
open and explained, particularly of Otfego ,
county, and it clearly appears that instead
ofthe privileges of freemen having been vi
olated and their fufFra3.es discarded, " for I
want of inere/orm. to answer sinister mo- |
lives," as has been asserted by a junto in 1
that slate ; the fails will convince every ra- .
tional reflective inind that these privileges, ;
so much valued and esteemed, as the birth
rights of freemen, have been-infringed and i
perverted by fotne of that very junto, whose 1
conduit will fta'n them with perpetual in
famy. The fails are simply these, that un
due influence towards the weak, threats
towards the debtor, and impositions upon
the ignorant, have been grofi ly praitifed by
certain lead ng characters in the county of
Otfego, to gratify private resentment, and
if pofiible, to answer completely the purpo
se, of party. In order to prove these fails,
a firing of affidavits is subjoined, which al
though too voluminous for one day's pub
lication, may be fuminoned up in the fol
lowing order :
ill. An aiiidavit of James Butterfield, a
collector of taxes in said county, dating,
that he received from Jacob Morris, super
visor, a b ;ok ei'timating the value of pro
perty, real and personal, apportioning the
ta ;es, &c. âthat the whole number of tax
able persons wa; 521, of whom only 18 per
sons were rated as being worth icol. and
upwards, and no more than tweuty-feven
persons whole real or personal estates
amounted to-iool. although the deponent
being present at the closing of the poll,
heard that upwards of ;oo persons had vo
te 1 at the said poll for governor and lieute
nant governor.
2d. William Garrett, one of the clerks
cl the eleition swears that 527 votes were
taken.
3d. John Mayall, an ancient inhabitant
ami afleflbr for the town of Otl'ego last year,
a-;d several years previous thereto, having
been present at the eleition, did fee many
persons voting for.governor and lieutenant
governor, who were- not entitled by law so
to doâ t.iat he informed the infpeitors,who
a Iked him why ht did not challenge them ?
He replied, that it was their dutyâthat fifty
vojed on that day which he attended, of
whom not more than nine or ten were
qualified.
4th. Phinehas Hill, atranfient person and
under the age prescribed by law, swears .
that he went to said eleition, in order to
make an experiment with the infpeitors,
and knowing that he had no right to vote
for governor, &c. But that Richard R.
Smith, late fheriffaud supervisor for said
town of Otfego, who knew the deponent
to be difqualified as aforefaid, took hold of
him by the arm, and endeavored to make
him voteâthat the depdnent then declared
he feared the coufequences ; but that Smith
said he would be his security from all harm,
whereupon the deponent tlid give in his
ballot.
s'h- John Cally fawfifty persons deliver
in ballots on the 28th of April, of whom
not more than ten were qualified. He in
formed the infpeitors, and said it was their
duty to challenge the votes; to which the
infpeitors replied, that the law was altered,
and that William Cooper, firft judge of Ot
fego county had told them, that every per
son who was a resident, and had paid taxes,
might vo'e at that eleition ; that the depo
nent challenged the vote of one John Hard
grove, but that William Cooper took hold
of him the deponent by the breast, and
drove him away from the table.
6th. Benajah Church, deposed, that on
the 27th day of April, he saw William
Cooper take the vote of a young man, who
informed the deponent that he was under
a.-.i: : he aifo saw Cooper lay hold of seve
ral persons who were not entitled to vote,
and oblige them to give in their ballots.
-tli. Jehiel Jackson, swears, that the
fa ts contained in the foregoing are true,
but that fearing leaf! Cooper might injure
his father, who is indebted to him, he da
red not come forward to make a particu
lar affidavit.
Bth. Andrew Cannon, swears, that Wil
liam Cooper declared he had heard that the
deponent came there to challenge votesâ
and said, if he attempted it, he would fend
him to jail, and /hewed him a mittimus
ready written for that purpose.
9- 'i- James Abbeyâunder ageâswears that
R. R. Smith, late flier iff, forced him to
vote, although the deponent told him he
wa; difqualified. '
loth. Adolphus Wabradt, swears he was
present when judge Cooper threatened Ja
cob G Fonda, that if he the said Fonda did
nor fubferibe a certain paper refpeiting an
affidavit taken by Fond:;, he (Cooper)would !
line fatisfaclion, if it ihould coll him
3,0001.
nth. Demih M'CaJfaty, April 27, was
seized by judge.Cooper, and obliged to vote,
although a transient person, and 110 way en
titled.
t2th. John Hardgrove, swears that judge
Cooper took hold of his the deponent's arm,
led him to the window, and put a ballot in
to his hand against his will, which he obliged
him to give in.
13th. JcfephWhitford, saw judge Cooper
draw in several tranlient persons who, witE
great reluitance, were induced to give in
ballots". Cooper also declared, that if he
heard any person speak in favor of governor
Clinton, he would take a fire-brand and
put fire to his barn. Cooper likewile threat
ened the deponent.
Having so far ilated this scene of open
villainy, which is not equalled by even Of
borne's conduit in Georgia, I might here
produce letters written by Cooper to his
friends, for corrupt purposes; and which
are at once the criterion of his scholar/hip
and intcgi itv.
After pending the foregoing summary,
it will scarcely be necelfary to submit the
determination to the public, whether the
votes of Otfego county did not meet the
fate they justly merited.
For the NATIONAL GAZETTE.
Mr. Freneau,
I HAVE long been disgusted by a mode
of expreflion, which I find is rapidly en
creafing, as well in public as in private writ
ings.
In the firft paragraph of your paper of
this day under the Philadelphia head, you
fay, " The Bank of the United States
HAs NOTIFIED the Stockholders, &c. u
Why not notified to Stockholders &c. ?
How would it readâ" the bank of the
United States has made known the Stockhol
ders''' 1 ?
If the mode of expression complained of,
is not to be supported upon juftinable prin
ciples, you will not advocate itâif other
wise, I iliall be glad to fee your vindicati
on of it.âAttention to our language is ne
celfary, as well as to our government.
Your ftriitures upon the above would be
pleasing, to one of your friends and
A SUBSCRIBER.
July 4. 1792.
[To this it may be answered that the
phrase, " notijiedthe bank,'" or " notified any
thing else," may be considered as elliptical
and the preposition to, in this cafe, omitted
by the law of citllomâor, the word iiotficd
may be considered as fynonimous with ac
quainted, and in that cafe 110 man would thia':
of fuperadding the word to. Or, lastly, why
may not notified be considered as including
the wor"d to, as an implied preposition ? fq
" cere te notum or facere te certiorem, is a classical
Latin phrase, exaCtly equivalent to the t n
glifh word notified, or, to notify, and evidently
includes the preposition to ; as, I acquaint
you, or, I notify you.)
ELK.TON, July 4, 1792.
The memorable anniversary of our in
dependence, was celebrated by a number
of the refpeftable Inhabitants of this town,
affcmbled at the Franklin Inn, where an
elegant entertainment was provided for
the occafiori. During the feftivity the fol
lowing toasts were given under the firing of
cannon.
1. The Independence of America.
2. The virtuous and, firm Patriots who
declared our independence.
3. The United States.
4. The President of the United States.
5. The memory of the brave soldiers
who facriaced their lives for our Inde
pendence.
6. May the officers and soldiers of the
late American army, never feel distress.
7. The National Afiembly of France.
8. Permanency to French liberty.
9- l)e la Fayette.
10. The memory of Mirabeau.
11. The friends of freedom throughout
the globe.
12. The agriculture, manufaitures and
commerce of America.
13. The state of Maryland.
14. The rights of man.
15. The fair daughters of Columbia.
The feftive scene was conduited with the
utmofl decorum and closed in the evening
with the exhibition of fire works, display
ing a variety of emblematic figures, invent
ed by Mr. John Baptifte Allies, an ingeni
ous French gentleman of this place.
NEW-YORK, July 6.
IF the decree of the canvassers is resisted
by popular violence, it may eftablifli a dan
gerous precedent, subversive of all law and
good government. If any question, inter
esting to the Hates, should be determined
by the federal court, which should displease
a powerful party, the decree may be resist
ed with equal propriety. The present at
tempts, to refill legal authority, may prove
dangerous to the federal government : the
federalifts are now setting a bad example
to a refpeilable party of men, who are dis
contented with the perpetuity of the debt,
and the gambling introduced into a young a
gricultural country by chimericalfyflems) men,
who opposed the American revolution, and
who preferred the tranquil adminiltration
of an arbitrary fyfiem to the licences and ir
regularities of populaf opposition â men,
whowifhed, at any rate, to enjoy their estates
and cafe, and who diflinguifhed themselves
as friends to government, ought to recollect",
that opposition to Jaw and government on
doubtful occajions, weakens political authori
ty, and commits every political blessing of
law, property, and justice, to the violent
palHons, and irregular caprice, of the peo
ple.
If the habits of fubmiflion are destroyed
on trivial occajions, by the inflammatory elo
quence, and letters, of ambitious partizans,
the best members of society may lose their
attachment to republican governments,
which, in practice, seem too impotent to re
strain faction, and controul ambition. The
violences of the people, when incited by
chiefs, and when impelled by personal mo
tives, may produce a revolution in the pub
lic mind, and the distance between licenti
ousness and despotism is not great. If they
are iincere and uniform in their political
principles, they will not, 011 an occasion
so doubtful, appeal to the people : if they
continue their inconsistency, and persevere
to.nflamethepeople.it is not illiberal to
lufpeft these ialfe patriots of base designs.
When the proved enemies to republican forms
aflume, with new and violent zeal, t.'ie lan
guage of liberty, their treachery becomes fuf
pefted. It may be the object of these new
patriots to convulse the state, and to erect,
over the dlfgufted and harrafled people, a
government more congenial to their character
and principles.
At a refpeftable meeting of the Officers of
the late American army, the 4th of July,
1792, atthehoufe of Captain Baldwin,
of the city of New-York, i# confeqijence
of a public notification to this effett, and
by adjournment continued to the next
day.
Col. EBENEZER STEVENS, in the Chair
Â»
IT was resolved, That the services ren
dered by the army of the United States, al
though the public faith was thereto pledg
ed, remain imremunerated ; that the pub
lic engagement to the officers and soldiers
was for a certain sum in specie, so be paid
them for certain military services, to be
rendered by the said army ; that the United
States have in the most full and unequivo
cal manner acknowledged that those ser
vices have been faithfully performed by the
army ; that the demand for their services

ton, (N. C.) arrived off Ocracock barr ;
Capt. Smilley was informed by the pilot
there, that seven men and two boys had
landed there 011 the 20th, and the next day
hired a Pilot boat to carry them to Wash
ington, leaving the 'wo boys behind them.
Upon being questioned, the boys informed
the people that they had murdered the
Captainj. the mate, and the cabin boy, of the
Brig , and having attempted to scuttle
her left her, and also that they had left a
woman passenger on board :
Whereupon, Wallis, with a party of
militia, took a boat, puifued them, and
lodged most of them in Washington jail.
The veflel was loaded with tobacco, indi
go and rice, from Savannah, bound to
France.
On Monday the 45th June, the above
mentioned veflel was taken up in the Capes,
by a schooner and pilot boat, and was, on

of the mate, and the reft of the crew, that
she could not perceive any blood in any
part of the veflel, after was deserted,
that some exprefled a desire to destroy her,

FOREIGN NEWS.
DUNKIRK, May i.
" Ail account is arrived, stating that the
French have been repulsed at Tournay.
The commanding officer, the Count de Dil
lon, led the French trdops into an ambus
cade, where were 15 pieces of cannon ;
about 400 were killed besides many wound
ed. They had him apprehended and tried
by a court martial, as knowing of the
scheme. He was hanged on a gibbet, and
burned half alive. The French troops were
6000 men. The remainder returned to
Lisle, from whence they went, which was
about 18 miles.
Ltjle, May 3. Four thousand French troopj
including three regiments of cavalry, led by
Count Dillon, went against Tournay, ex
pecting the gates of the town to be opened
to them, and that they should become mai
lers of the place without the lealt difficulty.
The garrison, who had been apprized of the
intentions of the F'rench, fix and thirty
hours before they attempted to put them in
execution, made a vigorous refinance ; up
on which the three regiments of French ca
valry, being suddenly f'e'ized with a panic,
galloped away to Lisle, where they spread
a report that their whole army had been
surrounded by thirty thousand Auftrians,
and three tholifand of them had been left
dead on the field. The next day the main
body, who had made good their retreat,
arrived, and upon the mufler, not
than fixy-one were fonnd to. be miffing,
twelve only of whom could be proved to
have been killed. The French troops, con
ceiving that their reception before Tour
nay had been owing to some treacherous
conduct on the part of their leader, seized
Count Dillon, cut off his head & legs, and
carried his trunk*o the Grand Place, Where
they burned it to allies. A French Abbe,
curate of St. Margaret's, who happened
accidentally to be palling this scene of (laugh
ter, ?id was fufpe&ed of having corres
ponded with the enemy, was also seized by
them, and facrificed upon the spot. They
afterwards murdered their chief engineer,
and two or three other officers, and roast
ed three German soldiers, whom they had
captured in their march. The next day,
those of their troops who had been taken
prisoners, returned to Lisle from Tournay,
having been released by the Auftrians, and
declared that they had been treated by their
viÂ£lors rather as friends and brethren, than
as enemies and opponents."
Brujjr.h, May 4. The loss of the French
at their attack of Tournay, was, two dra
goons and several horses killed, fgrtv fold! -
ers of different regiments taken prisoners,
iour pieces of artillery, some provisions,
baggage, arJ d implements for intrenching.
011 the fide of the Auftrians, there are none
either killed, wounded, or miffing. This
happened on the 29th of April. Â°On the
fame day another body of French troops en
tered the Austrian territory by Quievrain
who were opposed by 1800 Austrian infan
try, and 14 or 1500 cavalry, and were oblig
ed to retire with the iofs of 20 men kiiied
and several wounded. Thev halted at
Bouflur, Avhere they remained in fight of
the Auftrians. Ihe next day an adfion took
place, whichendedin the complete route
of the French who loft on this occasion 250
men killed, a considerable number taken
prisoners, and five picces of cannon left in
the hands of the enemy. Ihe main body
of the French then retreated over the fron
tier line towards Valenciennes.
â¢ May 10. Large bodies of French
troops are on the march to reinforce their
northern army. La Fayette's army is dai
ly receiving reinforcements. He seems by
L.s motions to be meditating some impor
tant attack, As to the troops hostile to
F 1 ance, it is computed, that the number of
troops in the Netherlands from Luxem
bourg to the sea, from the several German
powers, amounts to sixty thousand. T n
order to whet the appetites of these soldi
ers, and encourage them, all the plunder
taken from the French is to be distributed
amongst them-
An attack, limilar to that on Tournay,
was made on Mons, also on the 29th of
April, by M. de Biron, at the head of 8 or
9000 French troops. The place had been
reported to be badly fortified and its inha
bitants difaffefted, so that an easy conquest
was expected. Six or seven thousand Auf
trians, however, werefound to be in de
fence of it, and after a very little firing the
Queen's regiment, which was in the centre
of the French army, gave way, and the com
mander in chief fled. Reports fay that be
tween 7 and 800 of the French were killed
by the Austrian cavalry, who pursued them,
among whom was a foil of Gen. Rocham
beau.
London, May 15. The brother of the tin-'
fortunate Count Dillon, who was hacked to
pieces by his own soldiers, has petitioned
the National Aflembly, for what redress is
in their power. They have determined to
employ the most effe&ual means for the
discovery and punifhmtnt of the aflaffins.
The king of Prussia has issued orders for
70,000 men to march, of which he was him

be dealt with accordingly.
4thly. Resolved, that a committee be ap

Ext r aÃ of a letter fxom an American who has ben
some time in Europe, and is lately returned, to hi.
own country.
â¢â¢ Having concluded the private objects
of this letter, permit me, my dear friend,
to touch on public matters, and to expref
the extreme lurprife and mortification pro
by some changes in our situation.
which I never could have apprehended at
the time of my departure. Previous to
that date, it had been the proud and pleas
ing hope of every true American, that his
country was to be an example to the world
oi all the dignified virtues of republican
Simplicity, that It was to be the asylum ol
merit and liberty, persecuted in almost eve
ry other part of the globe, that it was' en
tering a career of glorious improvements ir
the ihade of peace, which would be the pro
p \r sequel to its fplendtfl ajid. patriotic Â«t
---chievements in the field of war, that it wa
to be diftinguiflied by the unrivalled blef
lings of an untainted and artless govern
ment, of a spirit of legislation equally fret
from mysterious concealment, an artificia
management, and a servile imitation, and ol
a ftyie of manners congruous to the purity
offuch a government, and to the honefl
imphcity of such a code of laws. Theft
were the sentiments which, you well know
animated us to the boldest conflicts, theft
were the sentiments which supported u:
under the severest calamities; and were noi
heft the sentiments aifo which confecratec
the motive and enforced the adoption 01
our present national government ? How
soon, ala- ! have clouds been thiown ovei
these bright and glorious Whc
could have believed that, in so short a space
of time, an aitive and influential factior
could havf been formed (pardon a harfn
nefs of language, which my indigpatiori wil
not permit me to (often) which by its doc
trines and ei deavors. would reverse om
sublime policy and flattering hopes, anc
make us retrograde in every path that lead:
to ufeful reformations, and a just provifioi
ror equal rights and general happiness. Yot
cannot, my friend, dojuftice either to mi
feelings or my reflections, without making
my situation in all refpeÂ£ts your own. 1
have feeu in Europe kings tottering on theii
thrones, and nobles tumbling from the
haughty elevation from whence they have
for ages insulted the rights of their injured
fellow citizens, and the firft tidings that a
waitmv arrival in my own country are the
attempts; of her degenerate sons to write and
talk and intrigue those antiquated usurpers
into fafhion. In Europe I have seen the
moll enlightened of its nations sick at length
of their enormous and perpetual taxes, and
ftrucrgling to get rid of them. Here, I find
that we are pursuing the mad policy of in
creasing- and perpetuating both. In Europe
t.iey are banilhing monopolies, and lotteries,
and all other tyrannical and gambling con
trivances, as fact as their crepuscular light
and corrupt governments will permit.
Here, in the meridian blaze of day, and in
the very childhood of our government, we
fee these pefcilent institutions patronized
and pampered, as if they were the nurse of
V'rtuc and the food of liberty. In Europe,
it is the effort of every pretender to politi -
cal science, to unshackle commerce from its
exccflive burdens and its galling restrictions:
Heie, we appear to be overloading it with
duties, and forcing ourselves into all the
impolitic regulations which oppress the ho
ned: merchant, impose on the tributary ton
(timer, disappoint the exchequer of its reve
nue, and generate frauds and forgeries and
perjuries, as liumberlefs as they are cala-
mitous. InFurope, it is considered as of
all things most delirableto fimplify and re
lax the general ijrftein of tlleir taxation,
and more particularly to diminift the vexa
tions resulting from the nature and number
of their excises. Here we are alreidy
pufliing them into the rt cefi'es of domestic
employment, and it i, not concealed, as I
am informed, that the polity is to be syste
matically followe ! up as fait as other articles
of manufacture artfefficiently matur d for the f ur
pcfe. In Europe, I have heard amo ; all
the molt enlightened statesmen and founded
patriots, but one opinion on the expediency
of dlminifhing the interference of govern
ment, with what rightfully and properlv be
longs to individual management. Here,! find
is an eagernt fs and laborioufncl" beyond ex
ample to multiply and complicate the ob
jects of government, to extend the grafp'iig
and griping hand of power to every pi \ ate
pursuit and every indi. dual occupation.
In Europe, my friend, be allured, that the
natidns infpirtd with the dignity of human
nature, and inftruited in the rights of men
are riiin\ from the pro Orate condition to
which they have been heretofore chained by
the ancient tyranny of feudal barbarism,
and the rapacious tunning of modern fif
cality : and car. any American, my friend,
who has seen the long benighted a:.d deba
sed nations of the old world preparint." to
cast olf the usurpations of kings and nobles ;
and to purge away the political cor ruptions,
the vices, thefoiiies, and the error,., which
have for ages opprefled the m ; can an Ame
rican, I fay, who has seen ether countries
beginning to knock oft'their galling chains,
behold an attempt to pick them up and faf
ten them on lfis own, with lei's Ldgnation
than I have exprefled ? âNo, my frier,d, it
is impofiibie. I know that y, u \\id believe
so ; that rou think on the fubjecV as 1 do.
But I mull tell you at the fame time, that
you cannot feci as I feel \ unlef }or will

Extrafl of a letter from the learned and ilâ 
ivjirious Priticefs of Dafchkaw, Privy
Counsellor to the Empress, Pre/ident of the
Imperial Academy of sciences at St. Pe
ter four gb, &c. &C.
" Sir,
"YOURletter dated loth of Novem
ber lad, I received some days ago, and by
as fpcedy an answer as poffiblc, I wilh
to flitw you the phafure I felt to fee the
zeal and ardour, witfrwhich you are pur.
suing the further improvement of a fci
cnce so ufeful to mankind. It will al
ways give me a peculiar fatijfaflion, if I
can contribute something towards the ad
vancing so interesting a branch of know
ledge. For this reason I will endeavor to
answer to the queflions proposed in your
letter, in as (atisfaftory a manner as lies in
my power.
In the Nov! Commentarii Academ'iac Pe
tropolitanae you will find a set of very in
teresting observations, that have been
made for a long series of years in Rufiia,
concerning the declination and inclination
of the magnetic needle. Being uncertain
whe her you have at hand these.commen
taries, I intend to order those observations
to beextrafted for your use. But as they
would be too voluminous to be sent with
the post, I have put it off till another op
portunity : wherefore I desire you to af
iign, in your next letter, somebody here
at St. Peterlburgh, to whom I may deliv
er a copy of these observations, as well as
any thing else which may serve your pur
pcfes and enquiries. However, for the
present, I hope the following notice will
not be diiagreeable, to you : I. Obferva

I iubfcnbe heartily to your wish, that
p. series of observations might be made at
St. Peterfburgh. concerning the tide-wa
ters ; and the fame idea was, a year ago,
already an objed of debate in our academy,
though not in the fame view.
Vineta, on the coafl of Pomerania,
was, some centuries ago, one of the moil
flourifhing mercantile towns in Germany ;
at present its ruins which are not seldom
to be seen under water, are the ruin cf
many a fn'p. It is universally believed,
that the fame revolution, by which Vineta
isms overwhelmed, fevered also, the Isle of
ilr-cn from the German continent, of
ivhich it was, till that time, the northern
mod point.
The author of that memoir, in the Me
moires de I'academic royale des fctences dt
Berlin, is the famous Leonard Euler, fa
ther to him who is now secretary to our
academy.
The copy of your ingenious work, you
have sent to Sir Richard Sutherland, is not
arrived. That gentleman himfelf being
dead, some months ago, I sent to his comp'
loir ; but there 110 one knew any thing of
your papers. I wish, therefore, you might
nave here or in London, a trudy commil
fary, through whose hands will fafely pt'.fs
every thing that (hall, hereafter, be sent
between us both. You will oblige me ve
ry much by giving me some notice, whe
ther the books are arrived I sent to the
philosophical society at Philadelphia, of
â .vhich I have the honor to be a member.
The printed paper, annexed to your last
etter, concerning the cause of gravitation,
is now circulating amonglt the fellows 01
â¡ur academy, and I hope will give them
110 less pleasure than your former disserta
tion on the magneiical poles.
Each new flep made by you towards
the improvement o! learning, will give me
\ peculiar fatisfaftion , and it is with the
treated elteem that I am your wet!
