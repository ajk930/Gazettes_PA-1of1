London, Sept. 27.,âThe empress of
Ru'iia, having obliged king Stauklaus to
renounce the new constitution of Poland,
and leaving him no alternative but that, or
to be overwhelmed with her forces, that
phiiofophical prince, and friend to mankind
has thought proper to comply, rather than
that his fubjefts (houki be itaughtered by
the forces of the northern barbarian. Of
the precise terms iniifted upon by the em
prel'o of Ruilia, we are not yet.fully ap
prised ; but we know,-with some degree
of certainty, that flie has not loft light of
private interest, and the future aggran
disement of her own family. Sheltates as
a principal article, thaU the succession of
the throne of Poland ihall be fettled'on
Prince Conftantine Paulowitz, second son
of the Grand Duke of Ruflia, and his heirs
male. This plan, if it takes place, of
vfhich there is little doubt, will free Po
land from the dread of being dismembered
by a second partition ; and if the coiiftitu
tion be nnt entirely annulled, but subjected
to certain modifications, the Poles, provi
ded their future fovere.gn imbibes their
political principles, may yet enjoy some
lhare' of tnat freedom which their present
enlightened prince wilhed to fecur-e to

S i R,
FOR some time part 1 haVe breri rruct
tlruck with the different manner t
which the monor.rals and republican in cu
city speak of the 1 te commotions in Pa
ris, and of the probable ilTue of the Fren 1
revolution. The monocrats make no al
lowance for the relentments of a great
people, suddenly emerging from the accu
mutated oppressions of three or four hun
dred years. In their sympathy with th<
king and queen, "they feel for the plu
mage (so use one of the Hi iking simile
of Mr. Paine) but have no pity on th<
dying bird " To abate a little of tbi
sympathy with their royal cot/Jins, it jin,;
not be improper to ilate the folic
circumftanees :
That the history of the outrages com
mitted by the republican party in Franc
comes to us chiefly through the chant.;! o
iinglifh or Auftnan newspapers.
That the vindi&ive spirit of the Frenci
mobs was derived from the monarchy o
France, which knew no mercy towards e
ven the suspicion of treason.
That the outrages complained of, hav<
arisen from that ignorance among the com
mon people, which is an essential ingredi
ent in monarchy.
That the balance against monarchy i
almott beyond calculation with respeCt t(
murders. The whole" number or person
who have been killed by the mobs ii
France do not amount, from the mo{
piobable accounts, to more than 5000
where.-s the murders perpetrated by thi
monarchy of France, in cold blood, b;
means of the baftile,gaols, gi- bets, racks
wheels, gailies, &c. have amounted, at s
moderate computation, to J 0,000 a year
for several hundred years, and to 100,00 c
every fifteen or twenty years by means o
war. To encoutage the republicans o
our country to continue their fympathj
with their fufFering brethren, and (to uf<
the words of Judge Peters in his late ex
cellent charge to a grand jury) to im
plore the aid of heaven in their favor, ii
may not be improper to Hate the follow
mg circumstances :
That the late outrages in France hav<
effeftuaby removed the only came of tin
divisions in the nation, by dellroying the
sources ofjealoufy and treason.
That they have encreafed the ftrengtl
of the na.ion an hundred fold, by -annihi
lating the monar hy of the country
'1 iiat they have laid a foundation for Â£
great nation's asserting the original right
of men to govern themselves.
That they have furnilhed an illnftriou:
precedent to all the nations of Europe :
not only to extirpate wicked kings, but tc
annihilate those abiurd things called limit cl,
monarchies, and those most dangerous ani
mals called go-jd kings.
That the annihilation of the monarchy
of France has cut the only sinew of hope
to the American monocrat3 of cllablifhing
a limited monarchy in the United States ;
after it fliall please God to take our belo
ved Prefidtnt to himfelf, or after the pub
lic debt is unfortunately paid.
1 shall conclude this address by point
ing out the craft of the friends of heredi
tary power in our country : They have
lately discarded the idea of forming them
[elves into an aiitlocratic corps, but have
united their influence to prepare the mind;
of the people of the United States for he
reditary monarchy \y connecting as much
monarchical fpleudor, and as many mo
narchical forms as p. flible with the adtni
initiation cf the government, and by ex
citing the most gloomy apprchenfisns oi
tL: j dangers and cOnvuTions vliicli sre to
attend ti.c future elections of a chief rria
giftrate. A monarch, when thus folded
fnta. our country, can create as many no
bles as he pleases, and a house of lords,
when thus formed, will be better scented
than if they had f'prung out of a hot bed,
prepared.by tbemfelves. One word more,
and I fha.lL have doneâThe fiiends of
monarchy suppose kingly government to.
be necessary, because mankind arc too bafc
to bear a republican government. If they
mean themselves only when they use the
term b fc, we will believe them ; but if
they do not, it is no forced conftrii&ion
of a monocrit's principles to fay, that he
considers all the citizens of the United
States (himfelf excepted) as knaves or
Fools. SIDNEY.

A Correfpoudetit thinks it no rnal! dif

superior officer of government is obligee:
to come ii.to it in oifguife, as was'he c.if
lately with Mr GEORGE CLYMER,
o' Phila itlphia,'he Supervisor General vj
Kxafe for the lla'e of Pennsylvania. Un
til he carne to Bedford, to prevent any ru
mour of h s approach, he jÂ»-.iF d for Gen
Knox, about to pay a visit to the Wedern
Polls; which by the bye mi ght not be a
riifs for the minifler of war, tiiat he mi ht
the better underfland he geography ol
the country, if poffihle ; fiom Be fore
Mr. Clymer took ihe name of Mr. Snith
until lie came to M'Derinet's in tht
Glades. There leaving his horse for hi:
ieivant to '-â ring on at liis leisure, he him
i'elf m tinted the fe.rvait's horse, a d rode
behind the p rtmanteau, as the waiter oi
M'Dermet, who accompanied him tc
Pjttiburg, undei (landing him to be a pay
master co.i ing in disguise with money c
payoff tlie troops. On the journey no
thing material happened, save at Civatt's
where acting as a servant and ru bine
down M'Dermet's horse and his own, he
was ill treated by the holt'er who caller
him an ill looking ellow, and fatd he dii
not ki.ow how to rub down a horse

him, retreated to head Qj-iriera. Th<
riex-t night hefent for his horses and chan
ged his lodpngs to the Bear ; but 11
tnnfpiring that he was an excise officer
the landlord not thinking it fate to enter
Ui him, wss obliged t,Â»,give him a him
and again he went to Head Quarters, 1111
ti! a secret lodging was provided for him
at Major Kirkpatrick's, the brother-,in
law of the deputy excise officer for this
diftrift.
When an outrage on the dignity of tht
United States is come to such a head ai
this, that a gentl man in the execution o:
his trull is ieduced to fuc humiliating
circum fiances, it is high time to look a
bout and a&, who governs, theiabbleoi

Mr Clymer's an fiver to the above.
THE conduit of a revenue-officer o
the United S: ites, on a late joumej
through the western-country of Pennfyf
vania, being' grossly misrepresented in t
Pittfbu Gazette-, as that he palled for
a personated other charedters, &c
to avoid being known ; .he begs leave tc
Hate some incidents, freely fj.,oken of by
hir.r. when in that town, which mull hav,

H brought his own po tmanteau, wi h
his cloth s and pap rs, into Pittlburgh,
late on a Sunday night, leaving his f'cr
vant a tew miles behind, to follow in the
morning, w th a horse .disabled from the
loss of a fore shoe. The servant, after
finding a smith, arrivd th: next morning
about eleven o'clock, am) not till ; fter his
mailer had drefTed, and paid a visit. This
was not to ast the servant, for which
there could be no occasion so near Pittf
bnrgh, and where the people are reputed
to b the moll temperate of any in that
country Being in company with Mr
William M Dennot of the Glades, he ap
peals, in this inflance, to him.
The name of Smith, was once mifiak
enly applied to him. He recollects, par
ticularly, to have mentioned the occasion
to Mr. ifpey, of Bedford. He had au
nprn introduction from Mr Efpev Â°n
. Ir. M'Deftnot, withwh m he rrave h '
about fisty miles, and docs not kt;ow or
believe, "thai h's name was one? )t!k â¢ ! to
the follt try road between the Glades '.n i

out choice ; but b ing represented, an-1
really found to lie infuitable, they v. ;r;
immediately changed for others, take 1 ) ir

these were in public houses. In the 1 ttei

not Major Craig, (not Mr Kirkpatrick'
politely prefled him to take a bed at hit
house, which he declined until within twi:
>r hree days of his departure from thai
town.
These changes were not made with s
view to privacy, which he did not afifeil
n any thing ; on the contrary making
l formal communication < f ail his public
ibjeCts, to moll of the principal inhabi
:a ts of P:i:(burgh, as he considered
:hem, afle ibl 4 for that purpose ; and
dp; ;ired in all parts of that town in co
pany and alone, at a!' hours from 7 in the
rn rn' guru.l ioa't night :âfor this he
may appea' to all P ftfburgh.
As to the tale o his personating Gen.
ilnox, it is only to be accounted for ir
! his way A gentleman of the name o!
Knox, cle.k in the office of the Secretary
of War, charged with money for the paj
f the army, pissed through the coisntrj
on the fame d lys, though by anothei
roue, & was mistaken for the Secretary o:
War.
He does not pretend to dirtemble his
ipprehenlions of danger to his person, ir
paffi ig through that Country ; a d.ingei
which would have jultified to any one m
his predicament, any devices what ver tt

a military officer of the United States
ha ing but a flight and accident 1 con

tlireatened, by men of some conlideration
with being scalped ; where the prefiden'
>f a state circuit court, expelslv gave a:
one reason for declining to take the depo
lit ions of wi nefles, pointed out to him it
the cafe of a riot, the " odium" to b<
incurr dby it. And finally, whe e tin

upo offences committed a ainft the lawi
of the union in such cases, have afFordet
a real encouragement to th m. Hethinh:*
to have adventured t all through a coun

perhaps, than to have taken an honorablt
chance in an Indian war.
The protedion of an escort, which hac

General Wayne, without the knowledg,
of this offair, and befote he had mention
ed his own apprehensions, ordered party
to rittend his return The party had or

it is an old obfeivation, that " there is not .
