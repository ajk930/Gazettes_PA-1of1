CHARLEST ON, Feb. 2 j.
Dn'Thurfday arrived here in the sloop
1 hree Sifters, from New-Providence, Mr.
David Porter, master of the schooner Poliy,
jf Baltimore, on his return to that port.
The following account taken from the Ba
jama Gazette, will disclose the elifaltrous
?vents which befel him, and his crew.
" Friday, November ir, 1791, failed
from Baltimore in the Schooner Polly, be
longing to Mr. James Clarke, merchant of
said place, bound for New-Orleans. âOn
the 16th, cleared the Capes, and until the
19th, laid to, having a severe gale of wind
atN. W. On the 26th made Cat-Island,
and at 6 P. M. hove to, with the ffiip's
head to the eastward, wind blowing heavy
atN. byW. At 2P. M. on the morning
following, was alarmed by the veflel link
ing. To my surprise, found ourselves a
midst a reef of rocks and breakers, the
night dark and a heavy sea from the N. by
W. Sometimes the veflel almost bare, but
with the lift of the sea drove over the reef in
three quarters of an hour, when an anchor
was let go. We now tried the pump, and
in an hour freed the veflel of \\ ater. At
daylight beheld the reef all around us, and
the]land about 2 miles and an half to leeward,
which was Little-Island ; at 7 A. M. got
under way, with the loss of the anchor ;
with much difficulty got thro' the reef, and
proceeded through the windward paflage.
The veflel proving very leaky, having con
trary winds, and the crew dilfatisfied, com
plaining of the infufficiency of the number
for the execution of the duty, being only
five and one of them afinall boy, on the se
cond of December, put into a port 011 the
north fide of Cuba, when we began toover
hawl our fliattered veflel ; we found the
leak to be under the step of the foremaft,
which was impollible to get at. On the
Bth, was in order to proceed, and at fnn
rife a small Spanish schooner, having five
men on board, came down and anchored
close to us. Three of her people came a
long fide, and asked for an ax to cut some
wood to put under hides, which I gave
them, and inadvertently permitted them to
come on board âAfter asking them some
questions, and their telling a pityful (lory of
being taken byaGuarda Costa a little time
before, all of a sudden, hangers, piltols and
knives were drawn by them. One of my
men was knocked down with the axe
which they had borrowed, another drove
overboard, and a third escaped by getting
into the hold. I was cut in Several places
of my jacket in endeavoring to escape ; at
last 1 surrendered and begged my life which
was given with seeming reluttance. They
then lashed our hands behind our backs for
a little time, when they drove us over into
the boat with fix pieces of meat, a small
keg of bread, and 110 water. I begged for
a few bottles ofÃriftol ale of which I had
thirty dozen onboard, but was denied a sin
gle bottle. They robbed me of my quad
rant, books, watch, flioe and knee buckles.
In this manner were we forced from the
velt'el, taking no more clothes with me
than what I could put in my box. After
depriving me of a veflel and cargo worth ill
that place not less than 5000 dollars, a con
siderable part of the goods my own proper
ty! 1 begged to remain on board or to go
011 shore at the main, but was denied either.
We ranged along the coast, and at sun
down, arrived at a houfc where were a
few negroes. We remained there that
night, and in the morning purchafedof them
a tarpaulin for a boat's (ail, giving them,
in return, part of my clothes. We ranged
along the coast through mangroves and

" Not being fatisfied 10 quit ihe coast without
endeavoring to obtain some recompence for my

to the Nivetas, where the seizure had been com
muted. Same people in a Sparnlh launch advi
sed me by no means to go to the town (Princi
pe) as I would certainly be murdered, that a
claim might be prevented. On the 20th, I got
lome lupplies, and went 111 pursuit of the Pro
vidence Hoop, but to our misfortune found her
to be gone, which added to our distress. as we
knew not well what to do. Our whole flock at
present was alb of jeiked beef, ten plantains, a
few craw-fifh, and half a tea-kettle of water,
which we used very sparingly. After remain
ing some days on the Cuba-Keys, part of the
lime living on 'irickly pear apples, and having
loft our flint and I.eel, and being without fire, we
were obliged to return to the coafl. After get
ting some luppliesfrom the negroes at the house
formerly mentioned, on the 23d set out, but
fortune favoring us, at fun down fell in with
Capt. John Miller, of New-Providence, who
gave us an invitation to remain on board his
Hoop, and we arrived at New-Providence on the
31ft of January."

V arious letters from New-York inform,
that Mr. Jay will be ftipported by a very
large majority in the southern parts of the
state ; and if those in the northern part,
who are oppofedto the re-election ofGov-
Clinton, and were disposed to support
Judge Yates, will pretty generally unite in
the support of Mr. Jay, whose character
and abilities are unexceptionable in every
particular, there can be no doubt of his
lucceeding.
NEW-YORK March, 9.
At a meeting of the Directors of the
New-York Branch of the United States
Bank, held at the Bank 011 Wednesday e
vening, Philip Livingston, Esq. of this
city, was chosen President of that Institu
tion.âThe Branch, we understand, will
Ihortly commence its operations.
On Wednesday arrived here, from Cape
May, Robert L. Steele, master of the brig
Wilhelmina,of Londonderry, who informs
that on the 23d of January, he failed from
New-London, bound to Dublin ; that in iix
hours after leaving land the brig fprurg
a leak, so that they were obliged to keep
both pumps going, Finding this to be the
cafe, they thought proper to stand to the
weltward to find a port of fafety. In this
situation they continued till the 28th, when
they came to anchor off Cape May, and in
four hours after anchoring the brig funk
when the Captain and crew took to the
boats, and in going ashore on the two miie
beach, the boats itove in the furf; they all
got fafe alhore. and remained three days in
this situation before they could get to any
house, and nothing to cover them but a few
wet fails: the people were very much froft
bitten, so much that three are supposed not
able to survive. The mailer has been verv
ill ever lince, but is now in a fair way of
recovery.
PHILADELPHIA.
March 12, 1792.
The navigation of the Delaware is now
clear to Trenton ; several river vessels ha
ving arrived from thence (ince Saturday.
A number of friendly Indians (it is said)
are expected in town every day, from the
Northern tribes of the Six Nations, to act

London papers as late as the 10th of
January aftord the following intelligenceâ
That the resolute determination of Louis
the 16th, declaring all the German princes
enemies to France, who fhonld after the
15th of Jauuary countenance the aflembling
and arming of the French emigrants, had
cauied a serious sensation in all the coun
tries bordering on the Rhine. These petty
states, it was thought, would not expole
themselves to the resentment of France,
without affliranues of support f.om the
emperor. The Count de Vergennes, the
French miniiter at Coblentz, had received
his letter of recall. An oath was prepar
ing at the fame place, to be taken by all the
French emigrants, the substance of which
was,fidelity to -h: princes, and " an entire de
votion to their orders, for the glory and
interest of France."âGreat preparations
for war were making throughout France.
The electorate was putting nfelf into a state
ol defence, and it was publicly announced
that imperial troops were to be cantoned in
the German villages, to secure the emi
grants from surprize.âTo prevent the
French from having any pretext for inva
lion, the French princes and the emigrants
were to retire into the Landgraviate of
Heiie, and there aflemble their lorces.
The magistracy of Worms had written
refpeftfully to the King of France, that
they had ever conlidered the reception of
the emigrants among them only as an ast of
common hospitalityâbut, left his Majelly
lhould take it in ill part, they had given or
ders to the Prince or' Conde to quit Worms
with all his retinue of difaffected adherents.
The Prince Bilhop of Liege was amongst
the moil strenuous supporters of the Ex-
Princes, supplying thein with every neces
sary for war, and promising still more. The
government of the Liegiois had forbid the
lale of Montesquieu's Spirit of laws and
Voltaire's queltions on tne Encyclopediaâ
All the emigrants in that state were order
ed to be equipped by the 10th of January.
His Holiness tlie Pope had been very ill of
an apoplettic fit, but was recoveringâOn
:he 26tn of December, a letter had been re
vived at Coblentz from the Emperor to
:he French Princes, "alluring them of his
nolt ample affiltanceâand that he had given
orders to Gen. Bender to line the iron
tier" ; the authenticity of the letter was
however suspected.
A (trift look-out was kept in the chan
nel for the (Britilh) Swallow packet, from
India, which it was supposed would br.ng
the most important accounts ever received
from that country ; it being expected ia
England the present campaign would de-t
termine the fate of Ser ngapatam and the
Myzor country, Lord Cornsvallis's army,
and the whole of the Englilh territory on
Coromandel coastâThe French emigrants
at Coblentz were preparing to retire t<t
Hanau and the Margraviate of Anfpacli
but that the emperor's notification to thei
elector, " That he conlidered even the
threat of invading that electorate as anhof
tilityonthe part of the French," hadfuf
pended their resolution. âThatM. de bainteCroix, successor orM. de as mi
nister of France at Coblentz, had nearly
been publicly infnlted by the emigrants ir
that cityâthe elector, however, and M. de
Artois interposed, and infilled that the
Emigrant Ihould give a proof of their ref
peft for the king by conducting themselves
with proper deference towards his miniftet
& c.âThe laie receipt of the abort advices but pre
vented vs giving them tn detail.
The focietv for promoting the improve
ment of roads and inland navigation in the
slate of Pennsylvania, have petitioned the
legislature of the f; me, that a company be
incorporated for the opening a permanent
navigation of the river Delaware and it:
branches, from the falls at Trenton to the
â¢ northern boundary of the Hate ; and thai
mother company be incorporated for com
pleting the navigation of the river Schuyl
kill, from the lower falls to the heads of its
fjveral branches, as far as may be found
practicable. In the former of those obje&s
it is believed the state of New-Jersey will
unite; and probably the Hate of New-
York, where the branches of the Delaware
enter the territories of the lalt mentioned
slate.
The value of the exports from the port
of Baltimore during the year 1791, isflated
at one million, seven hundred eigbty-twc
thonfand, eight hundred and sixty-one dol
lars âThe value of goods, wares, and mer
chandize imported during the fame perioc
is fixed at two millions, fix hundred anc
forty-eight thonfand, eight hundred anc
eighteen dollars and sixty seven cents. âTc
the distriCt of Baltimore belong 16,871 ton!
of Ihipping employed in foreign navigation;
and about one hundred fail employed in the
coasting trade, which may be averaged al
40 tons eachâDuring the year 1791, 26.88)
tons of American vefiels, and 18,664 dittc
of foreign, were entered at the above men
tioned port.
The Dismal Swamp (North-Carolina'
company have iflued proposals for cutting
a canal from the waters of Flizabeth rivet
in Virginia to those of Pafquotank, in North
Carolina, communicating with Gurrotnck
and Albemarle founds. The length of this
canal will be about lrxteen miles. The
country through which it is to pass is flat
and swampy, free from flones and covered
with he-ivy wood ; the canal is to be 32
feet in width and about 8 feet in depth,
which will enable boats, not drawing more
than three feet, to navigate this canal in the
dryeft seasons.â The main object of the ca
nal is said to be the draining of the Great
Dismal Swamp, which is ten miles a
cross. and about ten leagues in length ;
this vamp, when the canal is finifhed.
may be easily converted into an immense
rice lieid of the best quality of soil.âPropo
sals are to be received no longer than the
ninth day of April next. By means of this
canal a vail inland navigation will be open
ed from the Chesapeake, through the whole
of Albemarle and Pamlico fouuds, down tc
Newbern.

Mulattoes of St. Domingo,
ARE the motley breed of land-holders, gen
Icmen adventurers, parsimonious merchants,
actors, clerks, managers, and plantation-over
eers from Europe. The progenitors of tnii
fellow tribe were generally persons who camt
3ut from France, and other pans of Europe, tc
make fortunes rapidly, return, and spend therr
jnder their native skies. During their flay ir
;his delightful lfland, the pursuits of avarice wen
lot fufficiently powerful tr. reflrain them wholl)
rom more natural pursuits. No immediate ob
|efts of gratification presented but the enflavec
African female, who was therefore adopted vtci
r ponfa, and while Ate planted canes on th<
mountain, or tended a herd of goats in the val
ley, contributed to people the island with a pro
geny, who were neither European nor Afriean
ind felt no attachment to either, further thar
nterefl or the more immediate ptofpefls of ad
vantage dictated.
Natural affection had flill some influence
where united parental fondnefs had been ren
kred extremely weak from the unequal condi
:ion of the progenitors. The mulattoes wen
generally excused from the labors of the fieldâ
hey were house-keepers >, and clerks ; they were
house-boys, and poultry-men; they were waiter:
at table and taverns; they were filhermen
cooks, and turn-spits ; they were even bounc
aut to mechanical trades, and in general wer<
every thing in the line of domeflic employment
except field-flaves, who are reckoned the mof
degraded class in the islands, and absolutely pla
ced upon a level with the mules that turn the
cattle mills.
Many of these mulattoes, of promising parts
bad an education bellowed on them by no mean:
despicable. They could read and write anc
had some acquaintance with figures. Educa
tioil always engenders discontent where then
is not universal equality of condition. In confe
rence of acquired knowledge, they have foi
half a century pall been aspiring' to equal privi
leges with the whites; and we have seen, with
in these two years, that rather than not enjov
them, they allied themselves to the blacks
.vhom they heretofore held in contempt, anc
have carried fire and sword throughthe territo
ries of the white inhabitants.
There is every reason to suppose, from the
present example of their enormities, that the
future coodi'ion of the mulattoes in the lfland:
will be changed for the worl'e, as every Europear
jovernment will find its interest in
hem (especially if a general prohibition of the
Have trade fi.ould rake place) to a situation thai
will not afford the fame opportunities as hereto
ore, for exciting and aiding the infurre&ion ol
he blacks, or corrcfponding with the Spaniards.
Perhaps such a Hep (the equalizing the con
dition of the mulattoes and negroes) might beat
er.ded with some advantages. The Island)
lave not hitherto been considered as fixed and
ultimate places of residence for the generality
'f the whites. It was only (as observed above]
to make a fortune in a few years and away, thai
hey seemed to have failed thither at all, and il
:hey retained real estates, for the molt part they
:njoyed the revenues in Europe. This conduÂ£l
has ever been encouraged by the colonizing
countries in Europe, as it secured colonial de
pendence. When once the colonial whites
begin to consider the Weftâlndies as their
only proper home, a legitimate offspring ol
their own gradt will ensue, who may in time,
11 has happened on this continent, render some
of the insular governments independent of Eu
ropean supremacy; and grant those natural
rights of man to the negroes and mulattoes,
which they will in vain look for from the juflice,
the humanity, or the philofophv of Europe.

A description of the Dijmal Swamp in Virginia.
THE Dismal is a very large swamp, or
bog, extending from north to south near 3c
miles; and from east to weft, at a medium,
about 10: It lies partly in Virginia, and
partly in North-Carolina. No less than
five navigable rivers, besides creeks, rife out
of it 5 whereof two run into Virginia, viz.
the south branch of Elizabeth, and the south
branch of Nanfemond rivers ; and three in
to North-Carolina, namely, North-River,
North Weft River and Perquimonds. All
these hide their heads, properly speaking.
in the Dismal, there It'ng nofigns of" them'
ibove ground. For this reason there mult
be plentiful fiibterraneous stores of water
to feed so many rivers, orelfe the foil is re
olete with this element, drained from the
ligher land that surrounds it. that it can
ibundantly afford these supplies. This rs
noft probable, because the ground of this
wamp is a mere quagmire, trembling un
ler the feet of those that walk upon it, and
:very impression is instantly filled with wa
:er. We could run a long flick up to the
lead, without refinance ; and whenever a
ire was made, so foop as the crust of leaves
tnd trash were burnt through, the coals
unk down into a hole, and were extin
;uii'hed.
The skirts of the Dismal towards the ealt,
ire overgrown with reeds, ten or twelve
eet high, interlarded every where with
trong bamboe briers, in which the men's
eet were perpetually entangled. Among
hefe, grows here and there a cypress, or
.vhite cedar, which last is commonly mif
aken for the juniper. Towards thefouth.
;nd of it is a very large tract of reeds, with
jut any trees growing amongst them, which
3eing constantly green, and waving in the
ivind, is called the green sea. In many
>arts, especially on the borders, grows an
?ver-green Ihrub very plentifully, that goes
jy the name of the gall bu(h. It bears a
>erry which dyes a black colour, like the
;all of an oak from whence it borrows its
lame.
Near the middle of the Dismal the trees
;row milch thicker, the cyprefles as well
is the cedars. These being always green,
ind loaded with very large tops, are much
:xpofed to the wind and easily blown down,
n this boggy place, where the foil is foft.
â¢nd consequently affords but slender hold
or the roots that shoot into it. By thefe
he pailage is in most places interrupted,
hey lying piled in heaps, and riding on one
mother ; nor is this all, for the snags left in
hem point every way, and require the
utmost caution to clamber over them.
'Tis remarkable that towards the heart
jf this horrible defart, no beast or bird ap
aroaches, not so much as an fnfeft, or a
reptile. This mnft happen, not so much
from the moisture of the oil, as from the
?verlafting lliade occasioned by the thick
hrubs and bushes, so that the friendly
seams of the fun can never penetrate them,
:o warm the earth : nor, indeed, do any
jirds care to fly over it, any more than
:hey are said to do over the lake Avernus,
or fear of the noisome exhalations that rife
From this valt body of dirt and nattinefs.
These noxious vapours infect the air round
lbout, giving agues and other distempers to
:he neighboring inhabitants.
On the western border of the Dismal is a,
sine swamp. above a mile in breadth, great
:>art of which is covered with water knee-
Jeep : however, the bottom is firm, and
:hough the pines growing upon it are very
rail, yet are they not ealily blown down by
the wind : so that the people waded thro'
this part of it without any other hindrance
but what the depth of the water gave them.
With all these disadvantages the Dismal is
11 many places plpafant to the eye (though
Jifagreeable tothe other senses) because of
:he perpetual verdure, which makes every
"eafon look like the spring, and every month
iffume the ai'peft of May.

Mr. Printer,
IT would have been a sweet ingredient in the
bitter cup 1 have drank in the loss ot General
Butler, had his memory remained without any
imputation in the campaign that has led to his
exit.âWith refpett to his having received intel
ligence not communicated, the inclosed letters,
with which I am favored, will contribute to elu
cidate lam told it is further suggested, that
the troops for the campaign were unnecelTarily
delayed by General Butler at Pittfburg.--It is
forrowfui for me he exists not, to call for an en
quiry into it---but cannot help thinking, if his
correspondence with the Secretary at War is pro
duced, it will appear whether any delays were,
or what was the cause $ as it cannot be denied,
that the minifterat war received answers to his
letters from General Butler, by the return of
every post from Pittiburgh.
It has been a I'ecret struggle with me to fend
vou the enclosed, being under the necessity to use
Mr. Morgan's letter to me, as introducing it---
and to letting it appear it came to your paper from
onvfelf, being the wife of the unfortunate, and
so supposed partial to his memory.

Dear Madam,
On the 9th instant, I did myfelf the honor to
write a letter to the Secretary at War, of which
the inclosed is a copy.
You are at liberty to make such use of it as you
think proper.
I am with great refpeft and esteem, Madam ;
â¢your most obedient humble servant.

Sir,
THE gratitude I owe to one of the best and
bravest of men, who fell at my fide in a charge
on the enemy, the 4th of last November, and
vvhofe confidence and friendftiip was most grateful
to my heart, having commanded my attention:
to the care of those peculiarly dear to hirr
whilst living, I did not arrive in Philadelphia
from Fort-Waihington until Wednesday the jfl
in't* and my anxiety to fee my parents called mc
here without making an unnecelfary delay in th<
cicv. Since my arrival I have read with atten
tion his excellency Governor St. ClairVpoftfcripl
to his letter to you, dated Fort-Waihington, Nov,
9th, 1791, and his explanation of that P. S. b)
a letter to you dated the 29th of last month, ana
pub;ifhed in the Gazette of the United States, oj
the 4th in ft. both relating to information of im
portance, said to be communicated by Capt.
Slough to Gen. Butler in the night preceding the
a&ion, and not imparted by him to the Governorj
nor by any other person, until the army got back
to Fort-Washington.---It is not my intention,
fir, to enter into the views or design of his excel
lency in writing that P. S. nor to fay that had
Gen. Butler informed his excellency at the mo
ment Capt. Slough is laid to have made the re
port in qucftion, his excellency coukl not have
displayed his army in better order than it was, to
guard'againft the attack, or to have prevented the
route of it ; but, fir, it is my intention by this
letter to undcceive his excellency and you, by of
fering myfelf as an evidence to prove, so far as it
is possible to prove a negative, that the report ir
question was never made to General Butler, and
that he therefore had it not in his "power to in
form the commander in chief of it.âl not on!)
Â©tier myfelf as an evidence to prove this, but like
wise to prove positively, that the party sent out
under Capt. Slouch's command was not taken 01
intended to be taken from the right wing alone,
which formed the frontline, then under the ;m
---meciiate command of Gen. Butler 3 neither waÂ«
Capt. Slough, nor the party under him, oroerec
out by Gen. Butler, but by the Governor, ana
that without Gen. Butler being ever confulte*:
thereupon, nor did Cap:. Slough receive his or
ders from Gen. Butler, as fpec":ried> in his excel
lency's letter to you last mentioned. 1 not only
offer myfelf as an evidence in this business, but 1
conceive myfelf authoiifed to make use of the
names of others, my superiors, tor the famd pur
pose 3 and it is well known, Sir, in the armv,
that from the moment the report in question wa:
jfiift mentioned at Fort Washington, 1 contradict
ed it on the spot to the adjutant-general and to
others; and that I have made it my business to
do so on every proper occafion.âlt is my pride ski
well as my duty, thus to step forth in juftilication
of my deceased friend, from whom, or from whose
interest or connections I have not any thing to
hope, whose name and charader I only knew
from others until I was recommended to him by
officers 1 had served with and under, and more
particularly by my -worthy and ever to be lament,
ed deceased friend, Major Fergufon.âl have been
indeed honored in a particular manner with Gen.
Butler's friendftiip and confidence $ unoer him
every service to a man's country was made agree
able to the officer and to the private soldier.---
Kad he survived, fir, neither this, or other charges
lately brought forward, and which 1 also offer
myfelf as an evidence to disprove, would either
have been reported or gained credit : when his
excellency the President and jou shall knew that
I can have no expectation but of in
thus ftep;.>ing forward, and that I am fer.fible of
the conicquenccs, I you will do rne the jus
tice to believe that I know myfelf to be impelled
by a sense of honor alone.
I fubiftit to you the republication of this letter,
asjufticedue to Gen. Butler's memoryâto his
familyâto his friendsâand to the public.â
On re-perusal of it, left it may be supposed to
intend a crimination of Governor St. Clair's ve
racity, permit me to add, that is not my inten
tion, but to andeceive him, you, and my country,
is to fass imposed upon him. I have indeeo
Paid, in oppcfition to Governor St. Clair's relation
:hat the party under Capt. Slough was nor taker
3r not intended to be taken from the right wing
alone, and that it was not ordered out by Gen.
Builer, as the Governor states, but by the Go
vernor himfelf: 1 fay so, fir, because the ordei
>f delire came regularly to me as brigade-majoi
>f the right wing, through the proper officer j ant
vithout tirft informing or consulting Gen. Butler.
complied so far as was required of the right
ving, and made him afterwards acquainted there -
vith, previous to the departure Â«f Capt. Slough,
vho I called into Gen. Butler's tent to drink a
;lafs of wine 5 there, in the presence and hearing
>f several gentlemen, Capt. Slough asked my ad
'ice in two or three particulars, and Gen. Eut
er, whole knowledge was infinitely superior tc
nine, answered him, and gave Capt. Slough pro
>er advice in some other particulars unajked.
This, fir, is the whole part Gen. Butler had 01
tnew in the business.âl find that one of Gen.
Butler's friends, long before my arrival in Fhi
adelphia, has addreficd a letter to the Governor
n the Federal Gazette, No. 1011, on this fubjeft,
Â»nd therein requests answers to several questions,
leceffary to the arriving at truth and
he contrary. âThe Governor has answered two
>f them with his usual politeness and propriety;
jut left two others unnoticed, which, before Gen,
Butler't friends proceed in the invefligation 0:
.his business, it is of importance to them to be in
formed of, either by a publication or by a lettei

TO THE PUBLIC,
I HAVE just seen a letter addrelfed to the Se
cretary at War, by ensign John Morgan, of tin
U. States regiment, in which Rafter paying
himfelf some pretty little coirrprhnents) he ofle;:
himfeif as an evidence to prove tkat I did
receive my orders from Gen. Butler on the even
ing previous to the defeat of our ar my $ and tha
I did not on my return to camp make my repor
to him Merely to contradict this would an
fwer no purpose, but 1 flatter myfeif that the af
fidavits of a number of the officers and gentlentei
of the army, directly contradicting what he has
affcrted, ?and explaining the whole ot the busi
ness, will convince the public that I did my dut;
like an honest man and a soldier, and that wha
he fays he will prove, is falfe. Some of the gen
tlemen, whose evidence in this cafe I fliall want
live at a diflance, ] must therefore beg the publii
to suspend their opinion on the lubjeft, till the;
can be interrogated, See.
I am the public's most humble servant

I DID myfeif the honor to 'vr'teto M 'jor-Gen
cral Knox, Secretary at War, the 9th of Fe
bruarv, on the fubjeft of his Excellency Governo
St. Clair's P.S. to his letter dated from FortWafti
ington the 9th of last November, and the Gover
nor's explanation of that P.S. by a letter date(
the 89th of January.âSeeing my letter publifliet
in several newspapers, with some remarks thereon
by captain Slough, I think it proper to mention,
that what J have atferted does not reft upon mi
testimony alone, as {halJ hereafter appear.
I could have wished that Capt. Slough, or th<
Governor, had ventured to afl'ert, as requeued ir
my letter of the 9th ult. the hour of the night ir
which the captain is said to have made the repori
to general Butler ; and in whose prcjence he mad<
it. Why the gentlemen decline answering :hef<
enquiries, I can only conje&ure ; but i think tha 1
open, candid, explicit answers to thrle fimpl<
quelUons, 'without Jludied delay, arc due to genera
Butler's friends, and to the public.
My following correspondence with the Secretarj
at War renders it improper for me to .ake furthei
notice of captain Slough's publication at present.
On any other occasion I might not take the liber
ty to publifli an official letter j but 011 this, 1 hold
myfeif excufeable.

Sir,
YOUR letter of the 9th instant was duly re
ceived, and has been submitted to the President ol
the United States, and flvewn to Major General
St. Clair. Although there is no desire of fup
prefiing the evidence you offer, to controvert tnâ¬
(latement made by the commander in chief, yel
it is proper the fubjeft should be well investigated
ind considered; and in order to this, it may be
leceflary for you to repair to this city, which you
vill do as soon as convenient.

Sir,
] HAD not the honor to receive your letterda
ed the 21ft instant, acknowledging the receipt of
nine dated the 9th, until this moment} it was
etuined to me from Princeton by post, as I arri
ved in this city the day your letter was put into

I did m)felf the honor to wait upon you at the
War office, and as you was long particularly en

juarters.
I cannot suppose, Sir, that you have any desire
.0 suppress my proposed evidence, in juftification
)f general Butler's honor j and as I am now in
:own, I will wait your pleasure to describe the
node in which the fubjeft fliall be invefligated,
loping tha: there may be no unnecellary delay,
for his fame has fullered too much already, from
;hc unjust report, publilhed by your authority,
through all the newspapers of t! e United States
Having had the honor of general Butler com
rciitted to my guardianfaip, by an ast ct Provi
dence, no sea s shall deter me to betray the facr.d

this footing, and not as my dejire to controvert, the
(latement made by the commander in chiefs f->r whom
i have a proper refpedt : but, as you are plsaieJ
to make choice thereof, notwithstanding the de

I iubmit to itâBeing with great lefpect,

P.S. It may not be improper to inform you
hat having pledged my honor to Mrs. Butler, thai
I would pursue proper meafurcs for the juftifica
:ion of General Butler*i, in confcquence ot voui
lot having noticed my letter of the 9th instant.

To the Hon. Major General Knox.
In consequence of the above, I was honored by
Senerai Ktnox with a conference, in which I flat
:er myfelfwe were mutually fatisfied 5 ana I now
wait the mode to be prescribed in which the bufi
rcefs is to be investigated, when 1 pledge mylelf tc
luftify General Butler's honor, to the fatisfa&ior
Sf his friends and his country, whose faithful ser
vant he was. This alone is my objetf, and I toil
not desert it.
Would Captain Slough now name the officer:
and gentlemen of the army, whole affidavits h<
fays he will procure, to prove that he did make
the report to General Butler, &c. lam cf opi
nion that his friends would not need the testimo
ny of other gentlemen, had they no other. This
as a man of honor, I hop# he will do without de
lay* and mention the circumstances of the evi
dence. Candor and duty to the public, as wel
as justice to General Butler's friends, require it ol
hi in.
Was Captain Slough acquainted with military
duty, he would know that General Butler darec
not to have sent out a detachment for the purpo
ses fpecitied in the Governor's letter, without an
order from the commander in chief, any mort
than Captain Slough dared to have detached 01
gone with his own company without orders ; anc
the Governor will not fay that be ordered Genera
Butler to make the detachment. If then Genera
Butler was not ordered to make the detachment,
will any military man, or any other, believe thai
General Butler would have prelumed to give or
ders to that detachmen:? at a time too when ii
is well known he thought himfelf very indelicate
ly treated, if not insulted, by the Commander ir
Chief? Surely no : and Captain Slough must b<
a novice in discipline, if he thinks himfelf jufti
fiable in not having made his report to the Com
mander in Chief, by whose order he was sent out
and to whom, or to the officer of the day, it wa
Captain Slouch's immediate duty to have report
ed, and not to General Butler.
Jt is generally un lerftood from Governor St
Clair's letter, that the detachment under Captaii
Slough was sent out as a reconnoitring party
that wa- Jiut the cafe, as I (hall hereafter prove t>;
the oincer who delivered him his orders.
