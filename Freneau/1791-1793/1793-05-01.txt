From the National Convention
to the French Nation.
Propojed by M. ISNARD, and adopted by
the Aifembly, on the prejent crijis if their
fituaiion.
FRANKS,
CUCH is the inevitabfe lot of nations who
have given to themselves kings, that
they ne\cr can lli: ke off their yoke with
out a struggle with every neighbouring ty
ra'nt.
Scarce had you proclaimed your own lo
vereignty wiien the emperor and king of
Prussia took up arms again 11 you, but now
that vou have proclaimed your couiticuti
-011 to* be republican, there is not one del'-
pot who hfs not refotVed u/on your uttei
ruin. Those wiio h:Â»ve not already lore
-ed you into open war, are probably tempo
riling, that tney may the more ealily de
ceive vou, and it is but too true, that the
projected Ifc uggle i 3 between the enfran
chifcd Fiance and the cnflaved Europe.
. Be that so, France mult eventually tri
umph, if its will is firm and coultant ; ioi
nations ire Itronger than armies. Those
who have fought lor independence were
ever victors. Let Holland, Switzerland,
and the United States, be proofs- ot thi.
alfercion. . , .
Free nations find resources 111 their ut
moit extremities and dillrefs. Rome re
duced to the circumference of the capital,
arose iVn u defeat more formidable than
from victory. .
Reir. jnia. r, Franks, your own exploits,
when the Prutlians dared to pollute your
icrr â  y. Evei did the enthusiasm of li
berty -riumpli over numbers; ever did
fin-tune o*iile on the val mrous enteipiilii,
and viJfbTy'on truf ewrrajf- â 
Heroes of Marathon, Salamis, and Jem
mappe, we invoke your testimony. Intaiit
republic, such are thy models, such ale the
prefaces of thy success. Surely thou w all
reserved to give the u'niveife adifplay ot a
scene hitherto unknown, hitherto unima
gined in the mind ot man, for never did
such a cause occupy the foul oi mankind,
never was such a cause referred to the ul
timate decision of a tribunal of Not
the interest or concerns of the day is the
theme, polterity and ages *.o come aie the
fubjefl ; not the liberty of one nation âno,
the enfranchifement of the human spe
cies. .
Franks, may the sublimity of these ideas
inflame thy valour, crulh every tyrant, ra
ther than thyfeii become a slave- a (lave !
What lhall then new kings feed on thy
gold, on the fwcat of thy brow, on the pro
tulion of thy blood ? Shall again unfeeling
parliaments, at their caprice, dispose oi
thy fortune, of thy lite ?âShall again a fa
natic priesthood decimate thy indulhy and
thy harvells ? Shall again a faftiiiious no
bility tread thee under the foot of insolent
contempt ? Shall holy equality, lhal. facrc-il
liberty, the produce of thy unparalleled
exertions, again be ravilhed from thee ?â
Shall that noble empire, the inheritance of
thy ancestors? be d.lmen beivcl ?âShall
there be for us no logger the word Coun
try, no longer the nine of a Frank ? â
Shall this generation be deltincd to this ac
cumulation of infamy ?âShall it bear the
scorn of all Europe, and the contempt of
posterity ? No ; we will disappear from
the furface of the earth, or we will re
main upon it independent Franks !
Let every true republ can arm for his
country, let our iron and brass transform
thenifeives into the tliunders of war ; let
our forelts become veflels ; let France be
come one camp ; let the nation become one
rmy ; let the artist quit his art, and the
i eculator his speculation. It is more ur-
to acquire liberty than riches ; let
J cultivation retain but the arms that are
necefiary lor it; before we ameliorate our
foil, let us enfranchile it ; let those veter
ans who have def'erted their flandards,
blulh to fee their laurels fading before the
viitories of inexperienced but valourous
youth. Above all, let the young and vi
gorous citizen fly to the defence of the re
public. It is jufl that he fliould be expos
ed to the combat, ere the father of a fami
ly 'hall risque his more facreci person.
And you. tender mothers, wives replete
with love and sensibility, inflead of attract-
Sng and holding back in your arms those
citizens who are dear to you, excite them
rather to fly to victory !
It is not in the caule of adefpotthat they
are to combat, it is for you, for your chil
dren, for your homes. Inltead of weep-

And thou, patriotil'm, and thou, paflion
of liberty, a:.d of glory, who art the pre

of heroism and of virtue, enflanie their

Warriors, who at the voice of your coun
try fly to the field ol combat, we do not
endeavour to excite your courage, French
men and republicans, you are full of hon
our and bravery ; but we recommend tc
you, in the name of the republic, obedi
ence to your chiefs, and ftritt discipline ;
without discipline there can be no armies,
nol'uccefs; without discipline, courage is
useless, and number is impotent : discipline
supplies every thing, and nothing ftipplie;
its place.
Conquerors of Valmy, Spires, and Ar
gonne, w ill you futter to perish what you
have once saved ? Ts'o, you will also van
quilh these new phalanxes the north is vo
initing forth ; you will defeat England on
that element at present the theatre of her
power. Let our brave faiiors fly to the
veflels of the republic. Our marine, as
renowned for their patriotism, as our ar
mies, lhall heap victory upon vi&ory; dis
encumbered of an effeminate nobility, it is
invincible. Sons of commerce, who un
der the yoke of a delpotifm, that over
w helmed you withinfults, produced a Jean
Bart, Diiqnene, Kagne, Trouin, what i;
there not to be expecled from you undei
the reign of equality ?âNo more restrain
the combat to the discharge of cannonâa
freeman should depend only on himfelf.
Our grenadiers have themselves dismount
ed batteries with their bayonets. Our hus
sars have charged on horftback from the
ramparts. Do you in yourtu.n attempt
their decks. There let these proud islan
dersâthese despots of the sea, fall under
the stroke of your hatchet.
Sailors, soldiers, may a salutary emula
tion animate you 1 may an equal fuccef;

quered ? France becomes the fcolf of nati
ons and the prey of tyrants ; already fee
your savage conquerors dart upon her, fee
them insult, ravage, and lay her u afle ! fee

selves with, to appease the 11 ants ot' Ca

whither the hangman drags your friends

race â , lmig after you (hall be 110 more, the

You vanqtrifli, and there is an end to ty

(From an Eajlern Paper.)
" T HAVE ever conlidered a republicar
government, as the molt natural, anc
the mofl rational and equal government,
that ever did, or can exist among mankind
as it giyes to every subject thereof, a rlghi
and opportunity, to choose his own ruler;
and juclges, and it is supposed, that by a
majority of'votes, men of the greatest abil
ities, and candor, will be eleÂ£led to fill the
legislative and judicial departments ; âyel
we often find that mankind, by long use &
habit 111 those privileges, become inatten
tive and careless, and do not consider the
importance of them enough. They there
lore grow by degrees, remiss and indiffer
ent 111 their attendance on eieftions, anil
other public convocations ; they think
matters will go well enough; they have
some little bulinefs to attend to of theii
own, and their vote will be of but very
small consequence, and so they do not at
tend to cl.cofpg iltir goven.oi, their
counsellors, their representatives, See. by

which means those who have a friend to
serve, or a party to gratify, can and do
mutter their forces, and Without any or
but little opposition, choose thole who they
think \\ ill serve their own paricular in
terert withoui any regard to ,he abilities,
honesty, or integrity of those they vote for;
thus it is, we ohen fee men of the worffc
principles, and moil wanting in probity and
candor, and who are replete with tinctle
and duplicity, and mod it illtd in the base
arts of low cunning, fubtilry. .nd mean
intrigue, get into places i.f trust and ho
nour, who, to compensate their voters,
flick not at prevarication, and at the per
veriion of justice, to lerve their friends;
hence we hear (and with too much truth)
that an ailetnbly will grant a petition to one
man, and deny to another hi request
founded tipcn the fame aicot.nt, and often
on much more reaional le and Â£qt.i:able
grounds. hence it is aifo we hear so of
ten, nay it is a common observation that a
-rial at law is a mere lottery, and you may
as well toss up a copper for the decision of
i cause, as to have it tried by a court. A
man has a petition topreie. to the'general
ifltmbly, he is made to believe that hfs
H-ighbour A is his friend anil is a man of
nfluence abroad, and he knows he won
lerfully poffefles the art of in r j>ue, and
â vill allift him in getting his petition giÂ»nt
;d, if he can get him chosen deputy, he
nutters his friends, and urges theiri to at
end punÂ£)ually it the hour ot fonie public
neet ng and vote for Mr A. Other free
nen knowing or caring nothing about the
>lot, do not so generally attend ; the cori
equence is Mr. A. is appointed deputy, &
Alien he gets into the afcemhly, or Con

ution, and repays his voting friend.--., and

ation for want of friend- to all;!: hi 11 .
Judges, efpeciaily the afliilant judges, in
ounty courts, are Vilually non in,,red by
:he deputies oi e.ch county, and perhaps
ome of those deputies, owe their election
o some one man, who willies vo be a ju T
icc of the quorum : and anxious to r pay
lis friend for his exertions, in getting him
ippointed deputy, uses his intriguing art,
o get such a friend of his appointed a fide
tuige of the county court. 'i his jt.dge in
eturn mufl help his friend ; anu unit Is lie
s a man of great candour, he will do it;
jn this account, it is, we so often hear a
-omplaint that parties are judged, and not
:he cai.Je. Another observation is often
11 de ; tlio I conftls not so common; but
ndeed carries great impeachment 011 a
-ourt, that is it you get a certain lawyer,
,ou will be l.kely to have greater fnccefs ;
lot that he has greater abilities, or more
ntegrity, but he has greater influence with
:hc court. Ido not believe this is gei.er
illy the cafe, because 1 believe our juo-es
11 a general way, are men of comcieiue
ind candor, yet it is to be feared, thaL some
if the judges who get their appointments
yy their intrigue, give too much occafiun
or the observation : and lhonld a jud"e
who is to try a cause, be si. void of ir.teg
rity, and candor, as to advise a party to
-mploy such or such a lawyer, in p; eftr
;nce to another, merely became he (ti, e
recommended lawyer) has more influence
with the court ; it would be indeed li ock
nig; and when a jiu.ge has those feelings,
are our properties fair in his hand:- ? and it'
lie should be so bare- aced aiid undiiguifed
as to express his feelings to the parties
w hole cai.fe he is to try, need we any lon
ger wonder that we hear the <on.nion
complaint ' that law is a lottery?" And
ought not such a judge to be difphctd ?
My fellow freemen, these are tie causes
of complaint, and thc-y arise from your not
attending public elections punctually, and
thereby fruflrate those detigning and in
triguing men in their plans. Attend and , t
tencl till tile business of the elefuon is doi.e
and no donbt but righteous men will ) t t
rule over us: and by their example, we
fliall again become a religious, a republican
people, and so be a happy people.
From such causes we find by hiflorv that
all the antient republics dwindled aw a- â¢
became hateful to the people, ai d cave
place to monarchy : the people chose
to be under the controul of one 111,111 v [~,
was independent of the people for h- ,
sice, and could not be bought by friend
rather than to live in so great ur.ee, taii,| V '
From such facts Mr. Adams grounds | , (
opin on, that a republican government can.rtot exist long. He makes a kind of ex
ception to the government of Connecticut,
and alliens for a reason, the purity of the
morals of ConneÂ£licut ; but when we fee
the morals of a people depreciating ( as is
always the cafe in propertiOn to populati
on and luxury) then it becomes the true
lovers of the gov'ernmertt, to watch the
liberties of the fame, moie narrowly and
critically, and to g'uard against every thing
that tends to weaken it. 1 dare allure my
lellow freemen, that if they will ddigently
atte ;d all public ele&ion-meetings, and
vote tor men of abilities, probity and can
dor, for governor and alliltants, and men
void of intrigue for representatives, thole
who fear God rather than man, who will
difplate intriguing party-spirited men from
our feats of justice : then will our gov
ernment flourilh and prosper, our republic
will last as long as time, and justice will
run down our ltreets as a rtream, and righ
teoufnels as a tiood."

Vienna, Feb. n. The imperial troop>
deflined to ait against France, are divided
iuto four armies. The total number ol
battalions ot infantry for these armies i'
127 âof divisions of cavalry 67, and one hall
battalions.
Frankfort, Feb. 15. The two brothers o;
his late molt chritlian majesty have lent of
fitial notice of their brother's death to al
the courts in Europe. They have pro
claimed the dauphin king of France undei
the title of Louis XV 11. Count de Pro.
vence is declai ed regent of the kingdom
and Count D'Artois lieutenant-general
The regent has sent Colonel Van Roll to b<
ambail'ador at *he head quarter? of hi:
Prudian majefly. The king of Prussia ha:
already acknowledged the new king, th(
regent, and the lieutenant-general o]
France.
Feb. 26. Monsieur of France has publish
ed a proclamation at Ham in Wellphalia,
which mentions the late murder cou.mittec
on Louis XVI. and declares that the 'Dau
phin Louis Charles, born the 27th ot Mart !
1785, is king of France and Navarre, undei
the name of Louis XVII.' Monsieur thcr
declares himfelf to be regent, and that he
aflumes the reins of govei nmetit conjointly
with the other princes of the blood royal,
of whom the Count d'Artois is appointed
lieutenant of France. The proclamation
is dated â¢' January 28th, under our seal,
which we made use of in the ligning of so
vereign acts, under the seals of the king
dom, deltroyed by the reigning faction, are
re-made, in the year 1793, and the firlt of
the reign of Louis XVII."
A definitive reparation has taken place
between Monsieur and the uounc d'Artois.
The latter was jealous of the title of re
gent, winch his elder brother has formally
auumed. There was also a itrong differ
ence between their plans ot government,
ill cafe they should be able fuccefsfully to
re-enter France. Monsieur was for a li
mited monarchy, but the Count was for
re-eftabli(hing the former government,
with abating a little of its molt odious pre
tensions.
Monsieur, the late king of France's eldest
brother has received fix thousand pounds
sterling troin the king ot England, as a
present.
London, March 2. On the Bth of January
lall, Lunardi ascended in aballoon at Mad
rid, in the presence of their catholic ma
jellies, the royal family, and a great croud
of people of all ranks. He changed the fi
gure of his aerostatic globe to that of a
temple in the clouds, adorned with columns
and ltatues, afterwards he changed it to a
Chinese building, with arches and statues,
then to half temple and haif Chinese build
ing, and call anchor at twenty miles from
Madrid; he then proceeded to a vail height
(almost out of fight)âat four o'clock he
calt anchor again, at 38 miles from Mad
rid, where he llripped his balloon of about
700 ysrds of the linen with which he had
made the above mentioned changes ; he
then set fail and at (111 Ik landed near
the city ot Orcarco, 56 miles from Madrid.
His aerial voyage iaited five hours.
Madrid, Feb. 14. The molt extraordi
nary and energetic exertions take place in
all our ports. The officers of the marine
have all received orders to repair to their
ports with all pofiible speed. Our naval ar
mament will be ready for sea in 8 da\ s. The
public voice points out M. Langara, d'Ar
tizabel, and Mazaredo, as the 1110 ft eligible
for the command of it.
The indignation of the people upon the
firft intelligence of the death of Louis was
extreme. The French resident here were
obliged to conceal themselves, to avoid the
popular fury ; and their indignation was,
if pofiible, encreafed, when they were told
that the Convention had refufed the king's
mediation.
Extract of a letter from the French Camp
near Maeftricht, dated Feb. 12.
" Since my lad letter, we have twice
changed our encampments, the more close
ly to invert Maeftricht. We keep that city
blockaded, have ftopt many carriages with
grain, and taken some prisoners. We some- J
times interchange salutations with the en-1
emy's patrol.
" The garrison propose to refill ter
rable bombardment with which we are go
ing to entertain them. They arc incessant
ly at work on their intrenchments. We
are within a quarter of a league from the
city, patrol night and day, and Hop all who
go in or come out of it. There are a num
ber of emigrants in the city. Cannon
loaded with broken glass and iron are plant
ed in every street, in cafe of resistance from
the inhabitants; but I hope the red cap
which I wear will be placed on the tree ol
liberty, and that this glorioiu tree will be
planted on the ramparts of Maeftricht.''
Hague, March 6. An officer arrived liPre
this evening with an account of the capi
tulation of Gertruydenburg, to the French
after three days bombardment, on the fame
conditions as those given at Breda. The
garrison confiding of a Swift regiment, and
an 160 cavalry, to evacuate the town to
morrow, with the cannon of the battalli
ons, all the horses, and to march to liois
le Due.
An officer is just arrived from the prince
of Hefle at Maeftricht, with intelligence,
that on the 3d ififtant, the prince de Saxe
Cobonrg obtained a molt complete viÂ£lory
over the French, chaling them out of Aix
la Chapelle as far as Liege, with a loss, 011
their part, of 4000 killed, 260 prisoners,
and more than 20 pieces of cannon. On
the fame day prince Frederick of Btunf
wick took fonie batteries at Zwalme, kil
led 1300 of the French at Brugge, and took
700 prisoners, and marched to Rureinond.
The French retired from before Maef
tricht with precipitation, a:.d left some bag
gage and cannon. They had thrown above
6000 shells into the town.
London, March 9. The following par
ticulars of the defeat of the French before
Williamftadt, utre communicated to a
refpeftable merchant in this city, brought
by the mefi'enger arrived yesterday from
Holland. It is with an honest pride that
we have to (late, that apart of ourconntry
were actively engaged in so glorious a bu
finefi.
Capt. Manley, of the Syren, having pre
viously concerted the business with the
governor of Williamftadt brought his ship
to bear luccefsfully on the French army.
The French made an attack, in which they
were much annoyed by the fire of the E-n
---jjlilh frigate.
This, as it was unexpe&ed, Dumourier
was unprepared for. The garrison made
x rally, and 700 of the French were killed
by the fire of the garrison, and the Syren
together.
The French fell back, but returned a
gain to the attackâAt this moment a fluite
was opened which had the delired effectâ
upwards of loco of the enemy were killed
iy the fire of the Syren, the spirit and vi
gour of the garrison, and the cft'eft of the
inundation. Dumourier iound it in vain
toperfift. He abandoned his works, and
retired to the dillance of a league, up to
the middle in water.
The people at Auifterdam and Rotter
dam are in the utmost coufulion. They
liave packed up all their valuable moveables,
and are preparing themfeives on a mo
ment's warning for flight, but scarcely
know which way to take themfeives. Se
veral have endeavoured to obtain a pafiage
bv the packets, but there was no roomâ
others hired veflels which are to be in con
stant readiness to fail.

Dublin, March 12. The Lloyd's lifts of

iut poorly afl'uaged bv the taking of three
merchant ships and half a dozen paltry pri

Sixty merchant ships under the convoy

Paris, March 3. We are now in the most
profound tranquility. The plans of the in

of the latter to punifhinent.
March 5. Letter from the Minister at
War to the Conventionâ" I think it my
duty to inform you, that I learn by a l etter
from General Valence, that the Fruflrans
to the number of 25, or 30,000 men, have
advanced to the Roer, to relieve Macil
richt, and that the movement of the enemy
induced Gen. Miranda to suspend the
bombardment of the place. This event,
of little importance in itfelf, may only o
blige us to attack it in form, and retard us
tome time longer. Such is the precise truth
of intelligence, which may be conlidered of
more importance than it delirves, and on
which it is my duty to fix the opinion ot the
National Convention."
On the 15th of February the Senate of
Hamburgh received orders from the em
pire to dismiss the minister of the French re
public within 48 hours,& from lower Sax
ony within 6 days. In consequence ofthis
step an emt argo is laid 011 all lliips of the
Hanfe towns in French ports, and orders

The enemies of France have described
as a complete defeat the flight check of an
advanced port, which a finall part of the
French experienced near Aix la Chapelle.
The French made a retreat worthy oi
themselves, and the cause they defend :
they at present occupy an advantageous
polt, where they wait tor the junction ol
the two armies under Miranda and Va
lence (40,000 men) whoare rapidly mar

Mr. Freneau,
pROM the bitter complaints uttered in
the General Advertiser of the 26th ot
April, and in the National Gazette of lait
Saturday, by an Old fellow Soldier, I am
convinced he is wholly a flranger to the
principles of our people in puwer, or, in
other words, our peopleof tali.ion.
This, however, has nothing surprizing
in it ; and in such matters ignorance is
excufeable in a defender of liberty. We
soldiers, in fact, have very little know
ledge of any thing except fighting, and are
mere simpletons in the cunning arts ot
court intrigue. As my present (ituation
has perhaps afforded mt better opportuni
ty than the Old Soldier to make my obser
vations onthe polite world, if he will pro
mise me not to tell any body, I wiil entrult
him with a great secret. lam obliged to
take this precaution because I would not
choose that all the world ihould be ac
quainted with the principles of w hat are
called the well-bred, and likewise because
I am under fomelear left those, called by
certain gentry, the people, should take it
into their heads to ridicule them. Now,
as it is a rule with me to pay refpetl tc
all so far as they are really refpeifable, and
no farther, I will speak my sentiments ii
such a manner as to be underllood only
by those who have a right to underftar.c!
me.
Let me tell you then, my good friend
that yoii Ihould have cooked up a little dis
simulation with your complaints. Difli
mutation is the only virtue that pleases the
great ; for they abhor Jincerity, which ii
one of the principal faults they blame it
republicans. It is therefore out of season.
But let us return to the objeÂ£t of youi
complaints.
You complain that certain people are
unwilling to give to citizen Genet, the
reception he deserves ; and conclude, that
if a salute of artillery was fired for a herd
of savages, who have scattered death and
desolation over our western frontiers, we
ought atleaft to pay the fame compliment
to the representative of a nation that has
lavilhed its blood and treasure to set the
United States free from the fliameful yoke
of Engiilh tyranny.
As you cannot be unacquainted with the
prodigions refpecl for, and attachment ol
some persons among us to royalty, I am
alloniihcd that you was 'so brief on this
fubjefr. In general, the ambassadors of
the Indians are commiflioned by kings, and
very often too the ambassadors themselves
are kings. You ought not to be surprized
then, if they are featted & pampered while
here, and if when they grow tired of the
capital, their majeflies are sent home la
den with wealth and royal presents.
Ifgreatguns arethe ultima ratio regum,
certainly, they ought only to be used to
announce the future arrivals of their moll
gracious tawny majejties. On such a prin
ciple, it would be absurd so far to mis
use the state or federal artillery as to sa
lute the representative of a nation, who,
like ourselves, dared to fay in the face of
the world, that men ought to be free and
equal, thatjovereignty re/ides only in the
people, and that the people are the foun
tain of all power.
Such do&rines, however, are at this
day, by many in the United State-s, reckon
ed mod abominably paradoxical.
My dear Old fellow Soldier, if I recol
lect rightly, yon fay something about GKA-
TjTujje due from independent America
to France, as a a nation. Alas, my wor
thy veteran !âGratitude is not a plant of
this day's growth.âll is absolutely a word
without an idea, a mere unmeaning found;
â¢ r, if it does at all exist, it means that our
acknowledgements arc not due to the ita
tion that Hied its blood, and expended its
treasures even,to profusion, for our libe
ration; but to tlit king, Â«ho Signed ihe
official mandate.
I am flrongly of opinion, and I know so
much of the late couit 01 France, as si in
ly to belic\ e, that the king, in ligning trea
ties with the United State.-, knew nut what
he was alout ; for if he had been in
his senses, he would have been cautious
how he lent his liipport. \\ h ell was at that
time the upport ot the nation, to an en
raged mob, or rebels, (a the Americans
were then represented) who afpiied only
to be ranked among men, and conlVquent
ly could not otherwise than exhibit a dan
gerous example to those 26 millions of en-
Saved beings, whom Louis ca.lcd his sub
jects. .
My brave companion in the toils of war,
take not 111 evil part this lioneft remon
strance from your old corporal , and if at
our time of 1 fe we think it 110 longer pro
per to assume the pollil;ed and hypocriti
cal language of courts, be at least content
ed, with me, to drink your pint of small
beer Jans ceremtm/e, if you have any far
thing of money left, after paying taxes,
excites, and intert'ft upon certificates that
we were obliged to fell at 2s 6d in the
pound, to those v 110 have iince reaped
their harvest from our miseries, and now
have the complaisance to despise us.
AN OLD CORPORAL.
Philad. April 27. .
For the National Gazette.
Mr. Frenead,
C'OR Tome time part I have had it in my
mind to convey to the public, thro' the
channel of your paper, an iiiftorical lift of
the perfens who have been mafl'acred
ay command of those Eur< pean tigers,
who have the assurance to call themielves
:he lords and fathers of their people. And
this 1 do, in part, for the amujemert of
i/iofe in this country, who teem so highly
enamoured of royalty, or to fptak more
properly, of defjotifm.
No sooner, however, had I fairly enter
ed upon my talk, than 1 was convinced,
from the multiplicity of ro)al crtn es, that
whole volumes \\ oulci be nt ctilarv to ac
complilli my purpose. It was originally
my tlelign to proceed regularly back from
the age in which we live to those ren ote
times when hiltory mingles with fable;
beginning with the jVlachiavelian king
[Frederick II ] who brought the military
art to perfection ; and afeendi ig gradual
ly to the times when flour'flhed the fierce
Nimrod, the Frederic* <>t his age, [said to
be the firlt who invented the infernal art of
conducting men to (laughter, to the ca
dence of drums and tifir).
Finding it impraflicable fully to accom
pliihmy purpose, I fiiali content inytelf
with recapitulating two facts which are
too recent to be called in question. The
firft is extracted from _the works of the
late king of Pruflia. It appears f rom the
model! calculation of this- renowned mili
tary butcher, that avar of seven years,
that is to fay, a war from 1756 to 1763,
cost Europe eight hundred and sixty fix
ihoufand men ; and that duringthe long
reign of Louis the 14th, no lef> than fif
teen millions of men 1 ell victims to royal
ambition. Itis as utelefs then as it is end
less to follow these despotic barbarians
thro' ail their ambitious wars, with a
view of juftifying the French of the pre
sent age in cruihing into the dufl one of
those monsters, of a race stained with hu
man blood and carnage.
They find their thror.es in a 1110 ft tot
tering condition, and are exerting their
last efforts to prevent the total fall of def
potilin. In vain will they heap vifrims
upon victimsâfall they mullâand their
deftruÂ£lion will be accelerated by the very
resistance they make.
Let us then leave this monster, defpo
tifin, in that gulph of annihilation where
(he must soon forever remain, and unveil
the murderous acts of fanaticifm, that
monster with Medtifa's head, who has pal
lied all the human virtues, and transform
ed benevolent man into a ferocious mon
ster; who has engendered ignorance, the
most hideous plague of our species :â
Let us break that magic charm which ! as
proved so fatal to the world, and which
tho' perifning has flill ftrengtli enough
to afflict mankind. By exposing its baneful
effects let us render it odious to those \\ ho
may still be exposed to be led astray.
All enumeration of the crime? tommit
ted in the name of the God of peace h. s
been not very difficult to make 1 et. His
tory, for a long time back, is clear in this
matter ; whether it has been that religious
wars have teemed more odious than o
thers in the eyes ot despots themfelvcs, or
that the proscribed and perlecuted sects
have been more afliduous 111 recording the
history of their fufferings for the hei elit
of their posterity. I know not. Itis ike
ly however that by so circumstantially re
cording these bloody extravagances, they
were not without hopes that their dt fcen
dants would one day profit from the er
rors of the past, ?.nd avenge the blocd of
their ancestors.
I (hull now proceed to particularize thecourts, more strikingly deftruflive to the
human race, lince priejts have had influ
ence enough with tne civil power to pre
vent a free toleration of religious dpimon.

At that time war was not declared be

An ingenious artist has presented to the
French National Convention, for their ap
probation, and to be uled in their ships of
war, a new lort of hand-grenade. It is a
globe ol thick glass. filled with inflammable
air, which upon the h-.nd-grenade being
put inttf motion, immediately expands, and
burltsit into a thouiand pieces, spreading
vouudsand death in every direction.â
These grenades will keep any length of
time uninjured, provided they are not put
into violent motion. We do not hear that
ihe convention have yet adopted this new
implement of otfenlive warfare. âAnother
invention has, however, been adopted lor
the use of the French infantry againlt the
German cavalry. This confifis of pikes 12
feet long and armed with a mufquet, which
upon occalion is detached in a moment,
and ready for use. Belides this, the pike is
furnifhed with a fall's muzzle about three
leet in length, of plate iron, fervnig as a
kind of cap to the 1 end of the real
pike; this being driven into the body of a
horse, remains there and leaves the long
pike again ready for inltant use.

Delaware, 26th April 1793.
For the National Gazette.
THERE are some performances in
the literary walks of men, which
are difgraceful to the honest dignity of
human nature. Among these mayjuftly
be reckoned laboured eflays, paying tul
some adulation to temporary officers of
government. An upright, well intenti
oned official character will disdain and re
jest the servile flattery of devoted syco
phants, who for private ends, a treasury
luncheon or a grin of condecenfio i, are
willing to facrifice every idea of independ
ence, and become the contemptible tools
of what they vainly suppose to be power.
Puffing off the fervams of a republic is
an i republican, and ever more betokens
meanness of condition, or betrays some
finitler design. The people have set up
no man or men to be worshipped in this
country, and indeed the federal govern
ment by allowing its administrators such
profufe salaries as it ha , seems tacitly to
have intimated to the whole sycophantic
tribe, that the praises and puffings of in
dividuals would be fuperfluous, the high
salaries being meant to exclude all laudato
ry compensation whatever for their offici
al services. The approbation of 3 good
officer is the silence of the people.
A late fulfome ".'-ritcr, of the cad de
fcrihed in the beginning of this eflay, has
lately appeared in the Gazette of the
United States, who seems gifted with un
examp ed povtrty and baseness of spirit "
I am nolo 'y (fays he) and Mr. Hâis le
cretary of the treasury !"âNobody, Sir!
what do you mean by nobody ?âln a
republic every honell and ufeful member
of the community is fome'ood\> and at least
equal to any secretary or any public efficer
wh tevcr, as a man, in the scale of poli
tical confluence. Mult not the secreta
ry of the treasury, and every man of sense,
blush at such abominable trash as what is
below quoted, and call upon the red light
nings of Jove to blall the wretch, who al

In our paper of April 6th, mention was
made of a certain resolution being prefent
:d to the Pennsylvania House of ri(Terribly,
ending to the impeachment of John Ni
;holfon, Esq. the comptroller-general of
his commonwealth. The assembly h;.viiig
jroceeded thereon, but left the hufinefs
indetcrmined ; Mr. NichoKon has notified
he public as follows :â" I am advised
:h:it it will be improper in the present cir
:umflances, to bring before you tne merits
)f rnv cause, on the fubjeÂ£t of the articles
Df impeachment which you have ktely seen
in the public papers. I was anxious that
an invelligation of those charges should
have taken place before the adjournment of
:he legislature, that jufticc might be done,
and you be acquainted with the fadls, and
I prefied it witn all my power. As the
opportunity is !ofl until another feflion, all
I have to request is, that my fellow-citi
zens and the public will suspend their judg
ment until I have an opportunity to be
heaid."

EXTRACT.
In a republican government, every man
or member of the republic, ought to be a
politician in a degree, perhaps not so much,
nr so great as to be able to write on po i
tics a.-curately an I learnedly, but at lead
he ought to be so far informed, as to the
nature of the three great dillinftions of go
Â»ernments, now existing among the inha
bitants of the wo Id, (viz.) monarchy,
arillocracy, and democracy, as to be able
to judge with tolerable p ecifion, and un
derflanding, what man is of pure democra
tic principles, and in whose hands the re
public will be the most lik ly to flourifli
and continue unimpaired; then he can vote
for his rulers with fafety ; and I am fully
persuaded, that no means can be invented
to disseminate such kind of knowledge, fc
univerlally among all classes of people fc
well as through the medium of judicioui
news papers. In them are essays more 01
less on each kind of government, and in
formation of every thing which happens in
every one of the three different kinds. Ii;
Spain he will fee ihemilerable situation 0]
a people groaning under the a'ofolute noc
of a monarch, forbidden on pain of deatl
to read, or speak on the present politics o:
France. In England, which is a mixture
of all tl ree ; a king who is a monarch, i
house of loids, who are arillocats, and tht
commons who are called democrats; there
he will find that by the abfo'utenels of â¢
king, and the intrigues of the lords, the
commons have become almolt a mere name.
& the people deprived of more than three
quarters of their ancient privileges, anc
liberties,and that nothing short o{ a blood)
revolution will prevent them from degene
rating into the mod abject slavery. In
France he will fee the horrid and dreadful
situation of a people compelled to fight all
the crowned heads in Europe, combined
together,to regain that liberty which they
once enjoyed, and which by the God of
nature was given them to enjoy equally
with all mankind.
In America, he will with pleafure,view
the happiness of a free people, enjoying
all the iweets of a pure democratic govern
ment ; he will fee everv man enjoying his
own property unmolested, choosing h s
own riders, enacting his own laws, and the
uncontrouled mailer of his own aÂ£lions
He will be led to bless God in holy rap
tures, thai he was born to poflefs such pri
viieges; that he yet lives in a land where
he may fit under his own vine, and under
hi 3 own figtree, where .none are sou.id to
hurt or mole It him. He will then leriouflv
resolve and determine that he wi ! i do his
endeavours to hand these great blessings to
pollerity unimpaired ; and previously afiill
in putting a speedy end to those abuses
which have already in tome degree menaced
our liberty; by a iervile copying of, and an
adherence to systems, that have always in
their operation, proved fatal to the liber
ties o! mankind, wherever faiFcred to exilt
for any kngth of time.
He will conceive it his duty to attend
the annual, or periodical eleition of his ru
lers and magiilrates : to natch againfl the
intrigues of Uefigning men, and vote f:r
men ot pure democratic principles ; men
cf knowledge and abilities; men of reli
gion and virtue. lam informed that at
the late, meeting of the freemen in this
ILte, people more generally attended, than
has of late been usual, yet it is supposed
not one half of the freemen were present.
I hope that in our next freeman's meeting,
which will be in four or five month-., every
freeman will conceive it his duty to attend
to the important business of that day, and
attend not only to choosing his reprefeHta
tivrs, but that he will not leave the meeting
till he has given in his twenty votes for ho
nell, able, reli.ious democratic principled
men, to Hand in nomination for afiiltaiits.
I Have claims to about two hundred and
fifty thuulana acres of LAND in the (fate of
