Curfary obfervatiou on the pernicious
te lie icy of borrowing miney in Europe.
("Fro n The Cri'-i, a publication in the
Boflon Independent Chronicle.]
( Continued from our lafl. )
r>Y becoming debtors to Europeans, all
commercial reflriftions which we mly
wi.li to impose on them, may be counter
acted. During the war, the French had
it in contemplation, to fell the debt of the
United States. Should England purchase
of the creditors of Antwerp and Alll
- the debt of the United States,
their demand might be so precipitate as to
place us in a very disagreeable situation.â
Should we not immediately comply with
their demands, it might be attended with
very alarming; consequences By their
haughty threats, we might be placed in a
predicament, either to relent their inso
lence, by not complying with their requi
litions, or be obliged to discharge them to
the utniofl farthing. We therefore, by
our wanton contrails, expose ourselves to
become the sport of ambitious monarchs,
enterprizing miaifters, and venal parlia
ments.
Upon the principle, that foreigners can
not pofl'efs real eflate, it appears highly
absurd and illegal that loans lhould be had
in EuVope, for in this instance, govern
ment may invert foreigners with a large
proportion of the whole property of the
United States.
Difficulty in obtaining money for public
pnrpofes is the bed security for a proper
and frugat use of it. While loans can be
obtained w : th facility in Europe " the peo
ple" may be kept ignorant not only ui the
term 3, but the appropriation; while the
head of a department can negociate the
loan of millions, and mortgage the whole
country for payment, we are fubjeel to in
numerable inconveniencies, arising from
the vanity, ambition and interell of a few
individuals. Indian wars and every other
evil may originate, provided the heads of
departments are able to draw the money
from foreigners, rather than from the ci
tizens. Should this mode be adopted we
may in time expect to be cursed with II
the vile praflices and impositions of British
financiering, and the budget of an Amcri
can miniflry, like that of a British, m y
deceive the people by afalfe detail of reve
nues, and a mystical flatement of visionary
calculations.
Provided we transfer our debt to Euro
peans, it may become at some future pe
riod, by the management of an artful fi
nancier, an apology for more extenlive
taxation. It will!hen be only neceffarv
to urge the demand of European creditors,
to augment our taxes, and a very plausi
ble plea will then be made, that unless we
immediately comply, we may bring our
selves into difficulties, and perhaps a war.
The heads of departments will be ever
introducing European loans, as ghofls to
haunt us in all our public measures, and
deliberations They will be powerful in
flruments in the hands of men who are
in favour of introducing European systems
of government. Also to certain specula
ting individuals among ourselves, who will
be ever studious to propagate to
render the public funds a continual source
offraud and speculation. Every veflel ar
riving, will bring letters of some horrid
(iifaflers among the powers of Europe, and
our flocks will be conflantly fluctuating on
the conjectures and innuendoes fabricated
at 3000 miles diltance.
Our wharves, and even oar harbours
would be crouded with picarooning spe
culators, watching to catch the fir it Eu
ropean intelligence, and letters froin con
fidential friends in London, would be the
thermometer to ascertain the funds of the
JniteJ States. A lituxuon uifgraceful to
our riling government.
The people are-often amused with the
overplus of revenue, and yet we are cou
ftantly borrowing money in Europe ;
provided we continue this practice, the
United States will be i.i a few years
involved in dark myfterioua money
schemes, and the merchants and every class
of citizens will be groping in the dark to
unravel the intricacy, perplexity, and ec
centricity of financiering reports, calcula
ted to aii:t negjciators to defraud every
honelt maa in l'ociety. Ta>c after tax will
then be laid, the appropriation of which
will be totally inveloped in the arcana ot
foreign loans;. we may be conflantly
plunging ourselves in debt, and know nei
ther rue amount, terms, or period of pay
ment, till the mandate of l'ome domineer
ing monarch, discloses to us tHe fatal scroll.
Up'jn the whole, the perplexing fyltems
of financiering hitherto adopted and re
commended, however well disposed the
author or authors of them may be, seem
calculated for uie/i/e benefit of one par
ticular class of citizens, without paying the
proper regard to their operation upon the
political interetts of the country, its coin
mcrce, manufactures, and agriculture.â
Six per cents. 3 per cents, and deterred
tVock, are the legible stamps upon all our
liieafures; these are the standards by
which the patriotifin of individuals is deci
ded. These are the scales by which each
citizen is weighed, however conspicuous
he might have been in thole dayÂ» which
tried (not only thepurjes) but the touls of
men.
.Every man who is not within the focus
of this funding influence is Anathematized
by persons, whose public exertions never
appeared in any other initance,than in their
readiness to monopolize the loaves and
fifhes.of government.
Theintereft of this country i-s brought
to a few " plain, praitical and an adorn
ed" points, which are, to leifen annually,
the public debts, if there is any overplus
fortlie purpofe âto cftablilh peace with the
Indiansâto discharge all fuperniiinerary
officers, particularly in the war depart
mentâto lower throughout every depart
ment the pay of those that are ueceffaryâ
to break off all money connections in Eu
rope âto extend our commerce by eifectu
al navigation laws âsupport our manufac
tures âencourage agriculture, and parti
cularly to lay a competent duty on transfers
and discounts at the National Hank. These
are the Mential objects that demand the
attention of Congress. Long speeches on
thfcfe subjects are worthy the notice of the
public, but declamations 011 references,
See. are too futile for the coiHideration of
the Federal Legislature, or for the peru
sal of Â» The People."
To conclude, the whole art of finan
ciering, now coiififts in arranging our ex
penditures on the principles of oecouomy ;
our revenue beingfully fufficient for every
purpose of government, provided it is not
laviihed among officers, who do not earn,
either by their attention or ability, one
quarter of their annual salaries.

be afloniflied, and how much will you exe
crate a government that for ten long ye;<rs
could fuffer such men to struggle with the
pinching horrors of poverty, the trem
bling pains of nakedness, the con
temptuous smile of arrogance, and the
difdainful frown of oppression, and ltill
[Total No. 130.]
more will your aftonifliment encreafe when
you hear that these men have at length
presented themselves before the rulers of
the republic, alked only the sixth part of
their (tipulated dues, when inltead of pay
/they get contumely and contempt âand are
toldâyou have gained honour, go, feed
and clothe yourselves with that : They will
do it, the community will furnifti the fuel
| nocellary to cook it withâand government
the trimmings proper to make it up. Pu
nic faith has been for many years proverbi
al, it will now be forgotten, for the more
infamous new one.
Permit me now, Mes Enfant, as you re
gard the honour of your country, to in
treat you not to trust futurity to reward
your services ; you are the guardians ofher
honour as well as of your own ; the Ame
ricana fide; may be fond of travelling if
you encourage her. You have added a su
perb dome to the temple of fame, but be
cautious how you fuffer Dumourier, by
flattering his vanity, to believe that he
ought to be the weather cock of it ; for
commanders in chief have generally afi'u
rance enough to ascribe to their own pru
dence, valour, and conduit, the success of
all the enterprizes which accident may
throw in the way of an army : In all fuc
cefsful efforts they deserve a confidemble
portion of glory, but not such an exclusive
monopoly of it as they generally take ;
such for isfiance as, Cromwell beat the
royal army and established a common
wealth, Waihington took Cornwallis and
ellabliihed the freedom of America, Du
mourier drove Brunfwick out of France,
&c. for if Crom%vell, Waihington, or Du
mourier had never existed, England would
have been a commonwealth, America
would have been free, and Brunfwick
would have run away to Germany. If
Dumourier be poflelfed of a diltaut kind of
prudence he may poflibly polfefs your at
tachment and friendlhip, but beware how
you bedaub him with fulfome flattery, for
he will assume a faftidious defpicabie royal
pomp and parade, and itrfblently treat with
contempt and neglect the men whose ser
vices fliall place him on the pinnacle of
fame, particularly if he ever Ihould become
President of France without a competitor ;
of all misfortunes this is mod to be depre
cated, for it is unfalutary, dangerous to,
and inconsistent with the principles andfpi
rit of liberty and republicanilin to inculcate
and encourage in the people an idea,
that their welfare, fafety and glory depend
on any one man.
If the National Convention after yotit'
services are no longer wanted, (hould think
of dilbanding you without yjjur pay, tell
them that you have given your country
substantial benefits, which mult be reward
ed with something more than visionary
pay ; tell them that your strength fliall not
be diflipated by division, that your swords
which have been the inltruments add com
panions of your glory lhall neves be taken
from your fides until your services are re
munerated ; tell them that you will never
consent to be the only fulferers by the revo
lution, and by retiring from the field to
grow old in poverty, wretchedneft and
contempt ; tell them that you will never
consent to waale through the vile mire of
dependency, and owe the miserable rem
nant of that life to charit.y which ha;, hi
therto been spent in honour. If your
commander in chief be a man of duplicity
and fliall think it worth his while'to tread
on your diftreifes to ra-ife him one step
higher in the ladder of fame, he will con
vene you together and like a sniveling boy,
will fay to you, affecting to open the aque
ous outlet of his watry humours, " let me
intreat of you gentlemen, not to take any
measures, which will lelfen the dignity and
fully the glory you have hitherto maintain
ed. Let me request you to rely on the
plighted faith of your country, and place a
full confidence in the intentions of the Na
tional Convention, that previous to your
difiolution as an army they will cause all
your accounts to be liquidated, that the'v
will adopt the tnoft efFeftnal measures to
render ample juflice to you for your faith
ful and meritorious services. And lot me
conjure you in the np.me of Our common
country, as you value your ownfacred ho
nor, a:, you refpeft the rights of humanity,
and as you regard the military and national
charafler of France'. to express your horror
and detestation of the man who thinks o
therwise. By thus determining and thtls
acting you will pnrfue the plain and direst
road to the attainment of your wishes ; you
will defeat the insidious designs of our ene
mies, who are compelled to retort from openforce to secret artifice, you will give one
more iliftinguifhed proof of unexampled
patriotism and patient virtue rising superi
or to the prefiure of the moll complicated
fufferings, and poderity will have reason
to fay, had this day been wanting, the
world had never lee n thclaft irage of perfec
tion* to which human nature is capable
of attaining.
The tears of the hysna or the cries of
the crocodile are less dangerous than the
voice of duplicity. After Dumourier has
become your president, you will find the
â¢whole of his speech to be a deceptive pro
pofitionâfor probably one of his aids-de
funp will be made secretary of the trea
fi.'.-y who, together with his principal,

I ' majority, who are the mere auto

th motio.-.sfo well regulated by the chirf
ji: ; '<v!er behind the scenes, that the attempt
will be fruitiefs. You may be relieved pof
f .>ly 'iy changing your governors ; if that
be imp - icticable.your only remedy will be
in aiot'ier revolution, which will be natu
ral a->d illilifiable for you to wish for, and
end-avour to bring about by any means
v 'merer; for republicans that have been
0,-ipp 'd of tfieir rights, will never lick the
lis that robs them. A government of
favoritifin can exid but a very little while.
The ba'isof republican government is
public opinion, n basis whose foundation is

Rhmarks on the Indian War.
[Continued from No. 128 of this paper. ]
IN my last, I mentioned some causes of
the Indian War. with an intimation
that there were others which should be
considered. It is common for man to judge
of men according to his knowledge. This
is gained bv observation or reflection. Pur
suing this line, men are frequently mifta-
by judging of nation* with whom
they are not acquainted, by supposing them
~!'efled of the fame qualities as their
neighbours. No people are more liable to
impoiitionfc on this fubjeft,'than those ot
a honed or humane difpolition. Such
people think Indians as innocent as
>' neighbour Jonathan." This,fentiment is
oft i. med, by hearing some old do
rip. of t.u xiqdnefs of some old squaws,
one hundred years ago. Were we to en
quire in"i the truth of these tales, perhaps
little evidence would appear of their vera
city. yet people can ealily believe Indians
to be almolt as harmless as doves. But
how it comes to pass I know not, the fame
people have a very contrary sentiment ref
pefting our frontiers. Every tale told in
Philadelphia, by intereded or prejudiced
pe Tons gains credit,and they conclude that
white people are always breaking treaties
amifettling on the Indians' land not fairly
purchased Perhaps before the revolution,
there have been too much grounds forfuch
sentiments, butl haveknownof none lince;
for we are do: fettled near the lines, yet
the war is continued
Mv observations all reCpeft the Wederri
Indians; ueverthelefs, I think the motives
of war are nearly the fame among all unci
vilized nations. All men have some object
in vie*v a.id ait r'leir pursuits.are deiigned
to be fidfervient to that end. Honor is
the great idol wo'rfhipped by man in a date
of nature.
Among white people, the way to obtain
hono.- is to get money : This'l3 exemplifi
ed among 11s by many, who at the com
mencement of the war, had scarcely a hat
to their heads, but now, by speculation,
are become rich and honorable ; âbut this
is not the cafe among the Indians- Mo
ney makes no man a great man. When I
was among them, Kifhinnotiflee lived in as
small an house as any in the town, and yet
he was a head man, and with us dignified
with the title ofa King.
Solomon exhorted us to train up a child
in the way he ftiould go, for the impreflions
made in youth are of a lading nature.â
This is exemplified in Indians, for their
young men are entertained with war-ex
ploits, and the white people's scalps are ex
hibited as crowns of honor. An Indian is
edcemed no better than an old squaw, ex
cept he can bring cut his white rod, with
a firing of white scalps hanging to it. This
proves him to be a great man, and promi
ses honor amongthe nation where he lives.
By these means, the poor young favagea
are trained up to third after blood, as that
is the way to become a great man. They
are not fuffered to nialce exeiuTions very
young, left their courage should fail them
when they meet with oppolitioa and dan
ger- .
I do not remember to have heard any
person make this remark in writing, but
every honest man of observation who has
been among them, mu ft know it to be
true ; and this isthegreateft cause of mur
der committed by the Indians. They have
no principles to restrain them from mur
der, nor will they ever be reftrainea any
other way than by fear, till they are bet
ter inftrufted.
General Sullivan convinced the Northern
Indians of their folly and weakness in ma
king war against us, and now they are out
true friends; but the cafe is quite the re
verse with the Western Indians. Succef
lias attended all their operations against
us. While this is the cafe, men mull: be
worse than mad, to think of peace by the
ridiculous practice of treaties, which ha
ir.'* become a trade among them. Bui
what effect is produced ? Nothing but ri
dicule and scorn. It is common for theni
to fay, white people are fools, becanfe
tvhen Indians have killed them, till the)
jre weary of the bufmefs, white people
will give them great presents to make uj:
again.
It is laughable enough, to hear men tall*
us reducing the army in the present ftatt
di affairs, for there is no change of senti
ment in them refpetfing (bedding innoceni
ilood, and from their great fuotefs, theii
:>*ide is in its meridian, while we are con
idered in the molt contemptible point o:
new, as unable tooppofe them. It is oui
indispensable duty to augment our arm;
f neceflary, and appear in force equal t'
the business ; and when peace is obtainee
an honorable and equal terms, not to i;e
tluce the army, but disband the whole o:
hem as an umieceffary burden, and :
miifance to civil government in- time o:
3eace. Let land be given them to culti
vate, that peace and good will may abouni
among ail the human race. One thing 1
have hitherto omitted, which is, in itsopc'
ration, the greatest cause of the continu
ance of the war. I meantime port at De
troit being in the hands of the British
while this is the cafe, all hopes of peac(
are vain, and founded only in ignorance.
I do not mean thnt we should commenct
war with England, there is no danger o;
t, they are in no capacity for it; for it i:
?vident they are at the verge of a revolu
tion, and were they to attempt war for de
nanding our rights, the good people oi
England would soon interfere, and there
.vould soon be a ci-devant king of Eng
and.
Our operations have been wrong, and
.ve have rendered the nation contemptible
n the eyes of the Britilli as well as among
he Indians. Had our lenders asserted oiu
ights, and changed their operations, we
night have enjoyed peace before now.â
The circuitous rout of the Miami is ivn
)raÂ£ticable. Our whole force Humid be
;olleÂ£ted at Prefq'ifle on Lake Erie. There
*ve should build as many veflels of all fort:
is would be necetrary to waft our whole
irmy into the heart of the Indian country;
t would not be in the power oftheenen)}
to prevent it. Let us go up the Miami
yf the Lake, or land on the straits this fide
if Detroit. Let us inform the tommand
?r at Detroit, that we have no hostile in
tentions against the fort, he may keep it if
ie plcafes, but he (hail not exercise Britift
aws out of the fort, over the citizens oi
he United States. Let us open a trade
ivitil the Indians at the expense of the li
mited States ; we (hail be able to jinderfell
ill their traders, who are only in a privalje
tapacity. Let us be well prepared for
ivaror peace, and I could pledge my all in
this life, that we (hall soon have peace,
~or the end of war is peace. I have
houghts of giving my fenti merits refpccting

that my only view in writing, was to pro

so the Farmer, who is desirous to promote
Domeflic Manufactures-
YOUR enquiries in the National Gazette.
No. 127, refpefting the best culture of
flax, merit every attention. In my travels
through the states, I have been aitonilhed
not to fee more system in the culture of
this important production, which I have
paid particular attention to, and have jour
neyed many miles at the feed time, har
vest, and dreflingof flax, to inform my fell
of every particular, and to compare the
management in America, with that in o
ther countries.
The practice, generally, in America, is
to sow a spot of a half, a Whole acre, or
more, on as good ground as the farm af
fords ; but without much attention to it:
previous crops or management, and to
sow at the rate of one bulhel of feed to the
acre. Sometimes a spot, which receives
the waihings of the farm-yard, is made
life of, and produce? a great crop ; that is
to fay, 300 wt. or m&re of ftrwc, trom the
swingle, and 10 or r2, or more bushels of
: But most generally, the averaged
crop in the common management, is from
70 to nolb. of swingled flax, and five or
fix bushels of feed per acre.
In my various experiments, I have, in
the fame field, in the fame year, 011 simi
lar foils, and with the fame management
in all other refpeÂ£fs, lowed at the rate of
ane, two, three and four bushels per acre;
ind have proved to my entire fatisfa&ion,
.hat it is 1110 ft profitable, with proper ma
lagement, to sow four bushels of feed per
icre, American measure. The prudent
"armer will be particularly cautious in
owing none but the belt and cleaned feed.
To "cultivate flax to molt advantage,
'when vou cannot make choice of a spot
ivaflied by the overflowings of the farm
yard, or ftich other spot as may be peculi
lrly adapted to the purpose) plough in a
uortion of your wheat ltubble, soon after
iiarvell : 111 September, Ottober, or No
vember, cross plough, it, after giving it a
plentiful coat of manure from the farm
yard : Leave it rough in the furrow all
winter: In April, May, or June follow
ing, as most convenient, cross plough, har
row, and rull it, and plant potatoes in
row-, at the most convenient diflance to
tend them with a fingje horse ; which I
suppose to betwoand an half ortiireefeet.
Before turning the earth over the planted
potatoes, cover them as plentifully as you
can, with farm-yard manure : Attend
them as usual, onjy observing that the firft
ploughing ought to be from the rows of
potatoes 011 each lide, so as to leave a nar
row comb ; then pass a narrow harrow
through the rows, and this will return the
fine pulverized foil to the roots of the po
tatoes for them to apple inâ.tile next
ploughings must be to the rows: Let no
weeds go to feed among themâyou will
have a great crop of â  otatoes : Gather
them in a dry season, and your ground
will be in the highest order, clear of all
weeds, for a crop of flax, which must be
sowed (after two good ploughings, two
rollings and harrowings) as early as your
ground is dry enough, at the rate of four
bushels of He an feed per acre ; and on the
fame day, S, 10 or 1 sib of clean red clo
ver feed per acreâroll both in at the fame
time. This management will secure you
the best crops of both. You may cut your
clover in September the fame year : An
addition of two or three bushels of plaifler
of Paris per acre, after sowing your feed
and rolling it in, or after taking the flax
off, (preferring the former,) will make
you ample returns.
The peculiar advantages in sowing four
hufliels of feed to the acre, are, rft, your
flax is finer: 2d, It is of a longer texture,
becaufeit docs not branch so low down as
thin sown flax does : 3d It is not so lia
ble to lodgeâbecause it is not so top-hea
vy : 4th, you will have a treble crop of
fine flax : and sth, if you leave the flax
tinpulled, until ripe, it will yield a due
proportion of good feed, so as to compen -
fate for the quantity sown ; for 110 cli
mate surpasses that of America in this re
fpcÂ£t. Letting the feed ripen will, howe
ver. greatly exhauil the land, to the injury
of your clover ; whereas by pulling your
flax whilst in bloflom, or as soon as it be
gins to ball, leaves the foil very little im
poverished by this crop, and your flax is
the finer for it.
This management is very similar to the
most approved practice in Ireland, where
they sow as high as seven and eight bush
els of feed to the Irish acre; which is
nearly equal to one and three quarters, A
merican : for this purpose they prefer a
strong fat foil, and sow flax as early in
march as the ground will permit, after two
spring ploughings. Every farmer knows
that the ground, before ploughing it the
Tecond time for flax, must be so dry as to
pulverize kindly, and not to clod after
harrowing; yet a day ought not to be loft;
for the lint will be good in proportion to
your early or late feed time ; extra seasons
excepted.
By attention to the particulars here sta
ted, you may expeit from 300 to 6oolb.
and more of fine flax from the fwingle'per
acre, if you will pull it before it feeds, and
in proportion to the fatnefs of your foil
and the season.
The Roller is an inftrnment not fuffici
ently known in America : It is of capita]
life in preparing all clear grounds for feed:
in a dry season, a judicious use of it maj
make the difference of a good crop, espe
cially where the foil is light : for. rolling
your grain immediately after harrowing it
in, in a dry season, comprefles each grair
nearly alike, and retains the moisture, and
makes the grain vegetate equally. Flax
in particular ought to be rolled immedi
ately after sowing; for, as already men
tioned, it causes the grains to vegetate e
qually, which prevents after grow th the
good effects whereof are visible in every
after process of breaking, fwingljng, hatch
cling, fpinntng, &c.

" The operation of the Branch Bank in
3ofton, by the uncertainty of dijcounts,
>roves the injurious confluences refult
ng from a monopoly of this inftitutlon.
The fact isâthe directors have inverted in
t such it large proportion of their whole
iroperty, by engrossing, f with a few fpecu
ators) such a number of (hares, that they
ire become aJmoll afraid of their own jiia
lows; being so greatly interefled in the
'illicit of the Bank, it renders them timid ;
md so great are their fears, that every note
>refe:ited, while their tremors are upon
hem, is considered as having some magi
cal property, that may poflibly. fliake the
lability of the institution before it becomes
Jayable."
The rapacity of the dir;Â£tors in engrof
ing such a large number of the (hares, pla
:es them in a situation fomc-what like a
nail arming himfelf with so huge a wea
jon, that he is afraid to (or cannot) wield
t.
The monopoly of the Branch Bank is
jeeome a molt severe scourge to the trade'.
The discounts are so uncertain, and de
fend so much on the whims, nerves, ca
m-ice and fears of individuals, that the
merchant is totally deranged in all his en
gements. One month he can get a sup
ply, the next he is altogether deprived of e
yt ry /hilling ; and to add to his difficulties,
2". immediate demand is made for his for
mer note âthis unexpected call on the
merchant, together with the refujal, ren
ders all his negotiations uncertain,and have
a direct tendency to destroy every regular
course of bulinefs.
Another difficulty which arises in this
Bank,is their connection with a. foreign ef
tabliflimentâThe merchants not being ac
quainted with all the Jecret communicati
ons which daily influence the directors, are
unable to judge at what time difconnts
will cfofe; but be checked in their renew
al , without having any previous notice to
guard against the disappointment,
Stopping discounts at the Branch Bank
naturally operates 011 the Union and Mas
sachusetts ; in consequence of which, r.ot
vithftanding the establishment of three
banks within this town with iramenfe ca
pitals, a merchant of the firft responsibili
ty, cannot acquire a dollar.
The Union and Maflachtifetts Banks,
are fully fufficirnt for the real demands of
this (tate, and they arc able to give regular
fapplies to every class of citizens that ap
plies ; but the Branch bank being connected
with many contingencies, is conftautly fub
jeitto the humours of individuals, by which
means the other Banks are obliged to check,
in order to free themselves from the rapa
city of this intruder, by the colleition of
too great a proportion of their bills.
What with the timidity of the Directors
by owning so large a property in the Bank,
together with the foreign influence that
controuls, the bank is become an injurious
and deftruftive institution in this town,
calculated to perplex every man that has
any connection with it, and is the princi
pal cause thatprevents the discounts at the
other banks.
This being the probable state of facts, it
would be well for the merchants to present
to the next general court, a Remon
strance against the eftablifiiment of it in
this town or state, representing the grea
difficulties arising to the trade by the uncer
tainty of the negotiations.
Unless fomemeafure of this kind is pro
secuted with spirit and resolution, all the
banks will fooij become totally useless, and
the citizens will be constantly involved in
uncertainty and perplexity in all their mo
ney matters."

of an author, f<Â» generally known and esteemed.
Nor does it appear necefl'ary to request attention,
to peruse a work, whose importance is universal

cient fyrtems, and these volumes, will readily per
ceive, that the knowledge of philosophy, advanc
es from a (fate of infancy, towards maturity ;
nor \vill it appear too much, when it is said, that
Dr. Reid has diverted moral science, from that
veil under which for so many ages it has been
concealed, by ambiguous words and the jargon of
the schools. Thus he has aded that friendly part
to moial l'cience, which the ingenious Newton
and Ffcrgufon did to natural philosophy jâtheir

only an ufeful, but a pleasant exerciie, an'd a

Continuation of the Debate on reducing
the present Army Edablilhment.
Â£Mr Findley's Speech concluded.]
IF the militia are to be so much op
pressed, it mull be under their Hate
Jaws ; the operation of our militia law
has not been tried, and the militia will na
turally have more confidence in the laws
of the (late, and be better paid by them.
If the peopl.' mud undergo all the riflt
of hre and all the hardships of war, in car
rying on a war whicli they did not com
mence, nor have power to terminate, w ll
they not naturally look from the govern
in nt of the union, to that of tSeir own
dates? and wilt the Hate governments
conduCt a war with their hands tied ? Will
they not take their own way of conduct
ing the war and of procuring peace ?â
Surely they will, and the general govern
ment ought only to hope for obedience
End refpeft as long as it gives general pro
tection, which was the reason of its indi
tution. But if gentlemen were willing
thus to surrender the principles of the go
vernii' -nc, thev ought fird to put the fron
tier Hates in as good a (ituution as the new
Congress found them ; when the Indians
were not united and when they did not
know that they could so ealily and so com
pleatly defeat us.
Supposing that we appropriate a fuffi
ctent sum of money to pay the frohtier
militia for conducting the war of the uni
on , I ask who are these militia ? Is it
those unfortunate few whom we induce !
to fettle at Marietta, that are to protest
our extensive weltern territory, againd the
u.iited exertions of all the wedetn Indians ?
or is it the few f.attered inhabitants of the
fouth-wedern territory who are to un
dertake ou defence againd the numerous
and warlike tribes around them, aided by
our southern European neighbours ? Or
is it the scattered settlements of Georgia
vho from known causes are weak within
themfeives that are to defend us againd
the niod powerful and numerous tribes of
Indians on the one fide, and white people,
â¢perhaps little less inimical,on the other?â
Impoflible ! t 'his cannot on cool reficCtion
be the serious intention of even the mem
bers who have exprefled themfeives so.
From the very inadequate pay which
the militia have already received, and the
difficulty of obtaining it, however welldif
pofed the members who propose it may
be, there is little ground to confide in the
prov.'fion* being ample, especially wlien it
is conlidered that the expense has been
the argument mod dwelt upon by all the
gentlemen
/Arguments however of another and
mere important nature have been fugged
.ed : n favor of leflening the army. I mean
the p iceable disposition of our citizens
and the principles of our government; in
this I ".m heartily agreed, and were the ar
gil; <nt upon original ground, and the
meafurt optional I would doubtless op
pose an army; but the quedion is not,
whether we shall begin a war, or whether
we shall have a (landing army to aid the
government in time of peace ; if that
were the cafe I would certainly be on the
otier fide ; but Â«i:h us it is a queltion of
jieceflity, not of choice, it is to procure a
pe ce, and not to procure a war ; it is to
propel, and not to oppress or aid in go
ve >g our citizens ; I know that Hand
ing armies have r-.lways been sources of op
preflion and aids of tyranny ; our people
may long be governed without such ai< s,
their situation will not admit of abufts
from danding armie9, nor would the citi
zens submit thereto.
However, when I observe the difficulty
of procuring money for the support of even
a necefiary force, and thtjealoufy of ar
mies so prevalent among the members ;
whatever difficulties it may now pro
duce, yet this disposition augurs well
towards the security of our liberties;
when I also consider how anxious the peo
ple of the United States and the members
of Congress are for peace, and what ex
traordinary exertions the executive has
made to preserve it ; and when I also re
flect, that the next Congress will be a more
full and equal representation of the peo
ple's intereds and sentiments than we are,
I am confident the army will be dischar
ged as soon a3 our affairs will admit of
it.
The prospeCts we have of peace are not i
very flatteringâthey by no means arise
from the good dispositions of the Indians
towards lis, nor from the love of peace, but
from the dread of the power and perma
nency of our force ; take away those im
pressions and all our prospeCts of peace
vamfh ; it may be recolleCted that the Six
Nations of Indians were our inveterate foes,
and would never liden to the voice of
peace until they felt our power, and we
have fufficient proofs, that their continu
ing peaceable does not arise from their
dispositions towards us, but from their be
ing so much in reachyaf our power. Ad
mitting that the militia were in every re
speCt the bed for fighting Indians, and
that we could in jult'ce throw the burthen
and risk of fighting wholly on them ; yet
this method Â«ou d certainly lengthen the
war; we have, and always had the mili
tia ; but they are not a vilible force ; the
j llrokes the- make didrefs and irritate the
I Indians,and when the expedition is over the
force difp.ppears, and the Indians meditate
and too often obtain revenge; the apprehen
lionofan army llrikes them withapprehen
fions of a permanent design, and convinces
them that it i 3 their interell to have peace ;
the late murders of those who bore the
ensigns of peace are an undoubted proof
that the prospeCts of peace do not arise
I from any other motive than the dread of
our force.
When I refleCt on our having so lately
been convinced of the inditpenfible neces
sity of raiting an army, and before it was
possible to accomp'ifh theohjeÂ£l intended,
that a motion is made for lellening that
force, I am truly surprized at the incor.-
filtency to which it would lead; surely
there is not luch an inllance to be found in
the history of nations, nor in the acts of
public bodies, and if it Ihould succeed it
would mark our councils in an extraordi
nary point of view. However, so averfr
am I to armies and so sensible of the evils
they have occafloned, that I gave a serious
ear to the motion, and maturely examined
the circumdances in which the cafe was
involved. I wilhed for reasons tojullify
my supporting thereof, but examination
produced conviction of its impropriety.
The gentlemen doubtless have determi
ned from the fird imp effion of the fubjeft ;
more minute invedigation will convince
themfeives of the bad policy of such an
unreasonable change of measures. I with
great reluCtance was convinced of the ne
cessity of so great a force la(t feflionâbut
even if I hadb.-en finally against itlaft feflion,
I would nevertheless have been for fupport
mg that force in the present important
crifia ; better by far we had never made
the law for railing the army than to repeal
ft now.
The present Indian war is efientially
different from any former one. When
Britain and France divided North Ame
rica betwixt them, if the of
both excited the Indians !o war, the pow
er of both afforded protection. When
Britain became pofleded of the wedern
polls, and many tribes of Indians com
menced a war, the Britiih government
conducted the war, carried it into the In
dian country, and by the dread of their
arms procured a peace; but the Indians '
were not then supported by other powers.
But in the present war. the Indians who
at that time knew nothing 06 us, have
combined to make it a cor.vnon cause ;
and 110 superior power interell themfeives
in our favourâno, they conceive-our in
tereftstobe inimical to theirs. But if they i
did not receive encouragement, proteCti- !
on, and fuppliesfrom our European neigh
bours a peace would soon be procured ; '
the gentlemen who support this resolution '
know well how that matter stands, and '
they know explanations here are not con- j
v'enient. '
I once thought of moring a resolution c
for limiting the time of enlilling to some <â 
day in March or April next, knowing that 1
the intermediate winter months are the [
bed season for recruiting, and apprehend- f
ing the bed opportunities of disciplining
would then be probably over ; but upon \
second thought, I apprehend this was not t
necefiary, that moll probably the army
by that time would be so nearly compleat,
that all the saving of money it would
make, would be no object, and reflecting
that the President was already authorised
either to (lop recruiting, or to discharge ;
the new regiments when circumllances 1
would admit of such a measure. From '
the observations I have made the commit- ?
tee will be convinced that I design to vote c
against the resolution.
â  The UPAS, or POISON TREE.
!
A description of a tree in the island of
- Java, called the Upas, or Poison Tree, is
- given by a Surgeon belonging to the
: Dutch East-India company, of the name
c ofFoERSCH, who was Rationed at Bata
, via in the year 1774- Surprising as these
f accounts may be, they are accompanied
: with so many public facts, and names of
- petfons and places, that it is somewhat
â¢ difficult to conceive them fabulous.
The Upas grows about seven leagues
from Batavia, in a plain surrounded by
rocky mountains, the whole of which
! pla'n, containing a circle of ten or twelve
miks round the tree, is totally barren.
Nothing that breathes or vegetates can
live within its influence. The bird that
flies over it drops down dead. The beast
that wanders into it expires. The whole
dreadful area is covered with sand, over
which lie fcatttred loose flints and whiten
ed bones.
This tree may be called the Emperor's
great military magazine. In a solution of
the poisonous gum which exudes from it,
his arrows and ofFenlive weapons are dip
ped : the procuring, therefore, of this poi
lonous gum, is a matter of as much atten
tion as of difficulty. Criminals only are
employed in this dreadful service. Of
these several every year are sent, with a
promise of pardon and reward if they
procure it. Hooded in leathern cases,
with glass eyelet holes, aad secured as
much as pcffible from the full effluvia of
the air they are to breathe, they under
take this melancholy journey, travelling
always with the wind. About one in ten
escapes, and brings away a little box of
this direful commodity.
