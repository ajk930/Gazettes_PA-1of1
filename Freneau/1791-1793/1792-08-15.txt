SUBSTANCE of the DECLARATI
ON Delivered by M. Bulgakow, the Ruf
Jian Am'oajfiidor at Wurfaiv, to thi Po
ftfb Die', on the iSth of May.
Â«nnHE Ambassador declares that the
X liberty sad independence of the
Republic of Poland have at all times
drawn the attention of the neighbouring
powers ; and that her Majesty, the Em
press of all the Ruflias Itill makes tlus
claim, together with her formal and pofi
live engagements with the republic, and
declares that it has been her endeavour to
preserve inviolably these two precious at
tributes of her political existence. H?r
motives arose from her love of jullice and
order, and from her affe&ion and good
wilhes towards a nation united with her
Empire by identity of origin, language,
â¢and ail other natural relations. These
confideratious, (fays the Empress) repres
sed the ambition of those ruleis who, not
contented w.th that (hare of authority al
lowed them by the law 3, have aspired at
a .greater fkare of power than by those
kws they bad a right to claim. She
goes on to complain that those Rulers
have had the perfidious audacity to de
clare, as oppressive and humiliating, the
ad by which Russia guarantees the confli
tution of Poland ; at the fame time that
Germany and other the mod powerful
States have eagerly fought such a guaran
tee as a security of their property and in â 
*d<pendence. Sh2 declares that ber inter
ference for reftorinp the former conPiitii
tion is solely to be attributed to her friend
fliip and generosity.âShe recites the
modes adopted by the Revolutionilh,
â while Ruflia was engaged in a war againl)
two powerful entmies, to form a Confede
rate Diet i their object being 'to main
tain the free Republican Government, âtc
support the Magiftvates in their fun&ions,
âand to preserve the property ofCitizens. :
" She complains that this Diet orfaft
ion afltimed to themfelve3 all branches ol
power, hav t * prolonged their fittings above
three years and a half (a duration ofwhicl
the annals of Poland do not offer a fingU
instance) and to crown the whole, com
pletely overturned, on the third of May
17.91, the ancient form of governmeni
under which the Republic hzd so long
flourifhed."
The manner in which the revolution ol
Poland was effected is then described ; af
ter which the Empress fays, " that the
Revolutioniils, not fatisGed with having
created internal discords, have acted ir
such a manner abroad, as to be likely tc
bring on an open w*r with Ruflia, the ole
Ally, the bed friend of the republic cnc
of the nation. The utmolt stretch of ge
rerolity in the Empreft was necefiary to
prevent her from resenting sooner the in
sults with which (he has been provoked.
At the time that the Empress's troops
marched through Poland during the wai
â with Turkey, every thing neceflary fOi
the support of those troops was amicably
agreed on, although rancour seemed alrea
dy to re anif eft itfelf. But when the plan
for subverting the republic came to be ex
ecuted, the Ruffian troops were ordered
to be withdrawn from the Poliih territo
ries, and the old magazines were removed
beyond the Poli(h Frontiers, and a duty
was proposed to be paid on eroding the
river Dniester on the materials forming
It jhofe magazines, although they were pro
cured greatly to the advantage of the Po
lish Citizen*.âHer majesty's fubjefts in
Poland were arretted and maliciously im
peaehed for having excited the inhabi
tants to infurieftton. They were tortu
red into confiflion, and sentenced tc
death and executed. The profeffors ol
the Greek religion were perlecuted, and
among others, the Bi(hop of Parejaflaw,
an imperial fubjeft, fell a victim to his per*
fecutionâEven in the centre of the me

Russia and Poland have not only been vi

peft was (hewn to the person and exalted
rank of the Empress in open Diet,-and the
rudeness encouraged and applaaded by

uftify the Empress, in the fight of God

tis not with this view that the Empress
jublifhes this Declaration. She is led,
from motives of innate equity, not to con
ound the nation with the party who have
aetrayedher confidence. She is convirt
:ed that the majotity had no fharc in the
nfults offered to her mnjeily. Shu is,
herefore, willing to facrifice her jult re

LONDON, June 9.
AT length war, long threatened ha:
jroken out between the French and the
A.i){lrians. In one of our political fpecu
ations, near two months ago, we gavt
!t as our opinion, that the Germans would
lot crofa the Rhine, but prepare to afl
jn the defenfive, forefeeing that the viva
:>ty and indeed intemperate passion of the
French, would hurry them onto the com
mencement of hoflilities, by an irruptior
into the low countries, which would tenc
to bring a general odium on that nation
and to give an air of justice and populari.
ty to the war on the part of Auflria, ir
the fight of all Europe, at lead all, or al
most all the courts of Europe. The e
vent has verified our predi&ion. But wt
must confefs we did not forefee that th(
firft military effort of French freedom
would be attended not only with difaftei
but with disgrace. It it not the repulse
from Mons and Tournay that the patrioti
of France, and other countries too, hav<
to deplore, so much as certain circum
(lances that preceded, and others thai
fallowed it. The attack, oif rattier the
attempt, ort thofc cities was made in the
time of a truce, proposed by the French
commanders, it is said, in order to lull the
Auftriatis into security. The murder of
Dillon and his second in' command* with
the head engineer and some Auftrisn de
serters declare, in horrid accents, thfl to
tal want of discipline in the French ar
mies, and the danger every general officer
â ncars who m hardy enough to command
th'Tii, What the issue of all this will be,
wc must lea te, as usual in all complicated
cases, to time. At present, nothing can
?s.ceed the plain found sense, 2s well as
J. fciplined vigour, that appears in the
whole condudl of the Atillrians, both ci
vil and military : nor the blind and preci
pitate fury that ailuates the French mob;
tin we do not know a more pre/per term
for the atting part of that great nation,
ever iince it fell into the hands of the
Jacobines, tliofe ardent philosophers,
transferring to their neighbours the im
pressions that prevailed, and ahnoit raged
in t'leir own breaft3, imagined that the
chief towns in the Aultrian Netherlands
(vottld open their gates, and received them
with open arms. They would more than
divide the inhabitants, they hoped, with
an arbitrary though hereditary monarch.
In the firft place, they did not, when
they formed this opinion, make a just
estimate either' of the German or Belgic
character, neither of which is so ardent in
sentiment, or for quick in resolution as a
Frenchman ; nor did they consider that
the great party that still governs the Au
lliian Netherlands, is that of the aristo
cracy and the clergy,*
But if the generality of tJie people of
the low countries had been disposed to
(tin the French, they dare not to stow
their sentiments until the French fliould
ie in a situation, by the pofleflion of cer
tain places, to afford them protection.â
Although it is readily owned that there
never appeared in any age or country,
greater humanity or honour than what
liftinguifli, or, (hall we fay diftinguiffied,
French gentlemen and noblemen, yet for
those noble sentiments they are indebted
more to education, and thar education ari
ling in a great mcafure out of a feudal go
vernment, than to any kindly tempera
ture and milky foftnefs of natural disposi
tion. A Frenchman is by nature a pert,
proud, and fiery animal. That this is so
the democratical writers ,of France ac
knowledged, and boast of it. He has a
natural strut and air of defiance in his
walkâhe is quite at his ease wherever he
beâhe looks at you in the face with con
fident assuranceâhe thinks it below him,
if he be in any decent circumstances at all,
to attendhis shop, or any details of busi
ness. C'e/l une chife indigne, fays he, and de
volves it on the woman. When his angry
paflions are aroused. he knows no bounds:
but, like a wild bead, or savage African,
feels a propeniity even to eat the fle(h and
drink the blood of his enemy, or the vic
tim of his fury. The atrocities com
ir.itted on the mangled corpse of General
Dillon will not surprise any one who is
verfant in French hiflory. In the reign
of .Lewis XIII. the populace o * Paris fell
upon the Marefchal and Marchioness D'
Ancre, Italians by birth, and favourites of
the Queen Regent, Mary de Medicis {
murdered them, tore out their hearts and
livers, broiled them, and actually devour
ed them. The French are a people of
lively and impetuous paflions. It is a
problem not yet determined whether
the French are fufcep'ible of a republican
form of government ?âPerhaps they are
not to be restrained within the bounds of
moderation without the Heady and tight
hand of Monarchy âa well reguLted and
limited monarchy is the bell blessing they
could enjoy under heaven.
It is generally believed, that the king of
Hungary in the present crufadc in the
Numb. 83.
caufeof kingj, will be joined irtif only by*
the king of PVuflia, whofc troops are al
ready in motion for that purpose, but al
io by the king of Sardinia; if not, final
ly, by the king of Spain. What part

Mr.. Frenkau,
IJEING a reader of the G.ize/tc of the
_} United. States', which I borrow of a
neighbour, I find much h:is been laid
therein refpe&ing a (alary of two hundred
and fifty dollais a year you receive for
translating for the department of State.
This clerkship is there deemed by a-writer
that calls himfelf s.n American, to be in
compatible with your llation as con ucloi
of a newipaper. Of this incompatibility let
the proper authority determine. It may
be well enough, however, and ccrtair.ly
not unfair, to retort on this occasion.
I am ii,formed that ttie Printer of the Ga
zette of the United States, the immaculatt
Mr. John Fenno, is printer to the Senate
of the United States, the emoluments ol
which- office are very considerable, as can
be made appear from a calculation on the
films annually paid for his services as priu
ter. lam further informed that the fame
Mr. John Fenno enjoys exclusively the
printing forthe treasury department, where
it seems he has rendered himfelf a particulai
favourite âHe has also of late, it is said
made his approaches to another public of
iicciu Chefnut-Street, and is in a fair way
of being soon, if not already, in fullpoflei

From all which the natural inference is.
tjiat two thou/and or twenty five hundred
dollars a year, cannot otherwise than have
some fort of influence oil the Editor of the

brought into view. They who are (kit
ful at iracing cauft and effeel, will be at nc
loss in this matter. By comparing circum
fiances and nicely bidancing the quic,
pro quo, wonders will be brought to light
that no man would havedreamt of. I infill 01:
it, my reasoning is fair : if two hundred
and lifly dollars a year mitjl necefl'arily be
influential on one hand, ten times thai
sum mult undoubtedly have a tenfold in
fluence on the other. The principles ol
Mr. John Fenno, and his fetters-on, are
pretty well knownâbut, for the benefit o
the United States at large, they will be
better known in a short time by a pamphlet
of extracts from his former files. G

METEORS, in their nature and ori
gin, have been but little attended to, o
underllood by the generality of mankind
Altho' they have not been considered a:
the precursors of important events, ye'
those who are unacquainted with the revo
lutions in the natural world, fliould be in
formed that their effedls are indubitably
dangerous to the human confiitution.
It is a faÂ£t 110 less certain, than worth)
of rcmai k, that in the month of
there are moie meteors to be observed ii
the atmosphere, than at any other perioe
of the year, and that they arc to be seer
circulating more over extensive marfhci
and low grounds, than over higher anc
dryer situations : This is a faÂ£t tqnall)
illullrative of the vitiated Hate of the at
mofphere, and that then mult certainly be
a great quantity of inflammable air circula
ting in the atmosphere, generated in con
(cquence of the valt fermentation of vege
table matter, and the llagnant waters be
ing operated on by the-heat of the Sun
This air from its remarkable levity ascends
and when the eledt'ric spark comes in con
tadl with a volume of this air, it produces
the appearance of what is erroneoufly|call.
Ed (hooting flarsâThe projedtile appear
ance of thel'e accenfions,is longer or fhortci
in proportion to the concentrated quan-
the inflammable air., Hence we may
infer from the appearance of these pheno
rnena, that the equilibrium of the atmos
phere is greatly deltroyed in consequence
of the accumulation of the caloric princi
ple or matter of fire from the Sun, the ex
tensive fermentations that are carried on in
the mo'Jhts and low grounds, and the in
flammable component part of theJlagnarii
water exhaled in the atmosphere.
A knowledge of these appearances led
me to apprehend the approach of the epi
clcmici of the season, therefore they may
serve as forebodings of a great phyfieal
event, which may be in a great mealure
avoided.
Let me recommend to all, particularly
those whose stamina are delicate.fuch'as de
bilitated women and children, to avoid
cautiously the meridian fun, and the even
ing air, during the dog days.

Hints for eflM.\Jh\n* the Theory of the
T i U' K S :
bTranflated troni the works of a French
-Uit.nor, (ilow living) recently publithed
at l\rr;s.J
Tllr. authority of great names is but too
often filbfervient to the preparation of er
ror. 1 mis it has been that upon the credit
ot Maupertuis and Condamine, all Europe
has been taught to believe, and does gene
rally believe to this day, that the globe of
the earth is flattened at the poles ; that is
to fay, that the polar axis is considerably
(horter than the equatorial diameter. On
the contrary,; demonllration may be bro'i
to prove, that the polar axis is conliderably
longelt, or, in other words, that the globe
of tiie earth is, what Caflini formerly alfert
ed it to be, a prolate spheroid. The de
monstration that has been given by the
learned is ltridtly geometrical, and I will
venture to fay, unanfvverable ; and were
Newton himlelf now alive, I have 110 doubt
but he would abjure his error 011 this head,
although he was the iirlt that broached it.
The lunar theory of the tides, with which
the world lias hitherto been content to be
fatisfied, has nevertheleft been involved in
inexplicable difficulties. For my own part
I am fully of opinion that the ebb and How
of [he tea, the origin of which marry wri
cer.s have left among tlie secrets of nature,
are owing entirely to the alternate melting
of the ice at the poles, which in their re-
I'pective winter feafous ast surrounded
with an ocean of ice, upwards of three
thoufaiid leagues in circumference, but in
their fununer are reduced to a much lef;
extent.
It ha , been objected to this new theory
that " it denies the supposed aftio'n of the
1110011 upon the fact? of the ocean, which
agrees so well with the various phenomens
of the tides." But they who conlider the
arguments advanced,with proper attention
will fee, in a work I have written on the
fubjeft. that I do not by any means abfo
(utely deny the lunar influence upon the
ocean ; but iuftead of making the moor
act with moll power on the seas abont the
equator, by an imaginary attraction, which
produces not the Last effect (as there are
110 tides, or at lealt hardly any perceivable
ones within the tropics) I restrain her in
fluence to the frozen seas at the poles,
where the melting of the ice is partly oc
casioned by the rays of the full relieved
with conliderable heat from her furface, s
iaÂ£t well known to the ancients,* and which
has been denionltrated by the moderns from
the limple experiment of a glass of water,
lielides, it is not true that there is a perfefl
agreement with the phrÂ»fes of the moon anc
die flow of the tides in all parts of the world
The ebb and flow upon our own coalb
(1' ranee) answers rather to the mean, thai
the real and motion of the moon. Ii
other places tlie waters of the great oceat
obey other laws, which Newton himfel
was aware of when he said " Undoubtedly
there exilts in nature some other partia
caute of the regular return of the tides
which acts conjointly with that we have af
ligned, but which is still unknown." Thef<
general etfeftg, then, which would not agre<
with Newton's theory but in part, art
clearly accounted lor from the direit influ
ence ol the fun, and the indirect influence oi
the moon in reflecting her rays upon, ant
melting the cone of ice at the poles alter
nately, as the fun is in the winter 01
fuminer fignr. The liquefa&ion of the
ice perfectly accounts also for the regu
lar return of the. tides,their delay for fevera
every day, and other phenomena
wholly inexplicable upon any other plan.
lultead of this theory being confuted, ii
has been only contradicted on the authority ol
Newton, with whom, 011 this fubjeft, I dif
fer in opinion. As to Newton, I venerate
him for his genius and virtues, but truth
lias a (till greater claim to my regard. Se
veral philosophers of reputation have been
deceived by Newton's authority, and he
himfelf was deceived in many, particulars
by a too rigid attachment to his own system.
Newton taught that the centrifugal force,
which he applied to the motion of the pla
nets, bad been the principal cause of flat
tening the globe ot tlie earth at the poles,by
iÂ£ting molt powerfully at the equator.
Norwood, an Englifli mathematician, in
mealuring upon a meridian between Lon
don and York, found a degree 011 the earth
more by eight fathoms, than Caflini had al
lowed it ill f' ranee. Newton (fays Voltaire)
attributed the small excess of eight fathoms
in a degree, to the figure of the earth, which
lie believed to be a spheroid, flattened at
the poles : and he thought that Norwood in
nieafuring 011 a meridian to the northward
of France, mutt of conllquence have found
Ins decrees greater than those of Caflini,
iince he supposed the curve ol the ground,
as measured by him, to be longer." Now,
the degrees being greater, and the curve of
theearth being longer towards the pole than
* It u well kr.oum that the rays of the Moon,
specially towards the full, wtil render fijh and
other animal fulflances putrid in a few minutes.
Likewise, takctwo basons or pans with a small quan
tity of water m each, jufl enough to (ovtr thefur
face, andfa them cut in a bright morn light night,
one in thefhade, the other exbifrd to the rays of the
moon, and the latter will l/ciyfar th'foenrfitvapo
ritcd.
in lower latitudes, Newton ought in truth
to have concluded from thence that the
earth was lengthened at the poles ; yvhere
;is, oil the contrary, he drew the inference,
that the earth wa> flattened like an grange,
orâ in other words, was an oblate spheroid.
Newton seems to have been so intent up
on developing his fyltem of the heavens,
that in thi vinitance he entirely overlooked
a geometrical absurdity. He adopted with
out examination an experiment, which he
believed favorable to opinions he had pre
vioully entertained, notwithstanding it im
plied an absolute contradiction in the nature
of tilings. Our more modern aftrojiomer;
have again been seduced in their turn by the
reputation of Newt6n, and by a weaknefl
inseparable from the human mind, the en
deavoring to explain all the operations ol
nature by one liniple law. Even liouguer.
one of their fellow lobourers.fays politive
ly, that "upon the discovery of the earth
being flattened at the poles, rests the whole
fabric of natural philol'ophy.
Full of this mittakeh idea, a company oi
French philosophers undertook between
them, a journey to the equatorial and polar
parts of our globe, to eltablilh by phylical
proofs, this opinion of Newton ; yet fu
dazzled were they by the splendor of hi?
fame, that they winked their eyes againfl
truth itfelf, which far from the prejudices
of Europe,came to meet them in the deserts
and put herfelf under their protection. li
Newton then, and all his followers havefal
len into so palpable a miltake in this in
(tance, let us be suspicious of all their other
experiments, particularly that"of the (ink
ing of the barometer in high northern lati
tudes, and their other geographical observa
tions which seem to contradict the prolon
gation of the polar axis of (heearth. In out
prefeut research, let us let aside all human
authority, and apply to nature only, as Des
cartes did, who by only doubting the .truth
of it, overthrew the philol'ophy of his age,
a philosophy which had so long inveloped
the real laws of nature in darknef:., and had
so prejudiced the world in favor of Aristo
tle, that his ailertions were conlidered by
all the univerlities as the decrees of Truth
itfelf.
As to my own idea of the prolongation of
The earth at the poles, it is deduced from
the experiments of Kepler, Childrey, Ty
tho-Brahi, Caffini, aud the observations of
everal modern French philosophers of re
jute. The prodigious extent of the frozen
jceans that surround the poles, I have
proved in the couiTe of the works I have
jublilhed, from the voyages of Dennis,
Beerings, Cook, and other celebrated na
vigators of the northern and southern
jceans.
The reader will also find that the opinion
of the deviation of the fun from the eclip
tic, in very ancient times, is supported from
Egyptian tradition, Chiiiefe annals, and
even from the Grecian liiftory.
The total thaw of the polar ice, and the
universal deluge which was only a confe
rence thereof, I have found clearly men
tioned in the books of Moles and Job, ii:
the holy scriptures,
Thefolar heat reflected from thefiirfuce

ago as in the time of Pliny, and confirmed
very lately by experiments made at Rome
and Paris.
That there are general currents whicl:
flow fix months alternately, in the mail
oceans, from botli poles towards the equa

Columbus, Beerings, Martens, F.llis, Lin
fchoten, Abel Ta(man,Dampier, Pennant
Rennefort, etc. âFnm all these writers 1
have made a collection of scattered obser
vations, tending to prove that there is a ge
neral agreement in the movements of lh<

the heat of the funâthe mrans, ire thepolai

Some haveaflerted, that in proportion as
you advance to the poles, the lea. becomes
clear of ice, and the navigation free ami

To the People of the United States,
A I TEND to your real prosperity, now
or never, and be not indifferent to the rnea
furesof your government, otherwise the
day will quickly advance when you will
no longer be permitted to hold any (hare
in its adminiltration. Already you have
been told that " you should not trull to
your own judgment in the choice of repre
sentatives." There are, I well know, a
number who would jhdge Joy ycu. Submit
to this : let this become a precedent, and
you will soon after find yohrfelves reduced
belpw the rank of civilized beings. The
very channels of information will be denied
you, and the wretched Jituation of the
much-injured Jdtii uatio* will be realized

once redticed to the fame state of igno
rance.lt was the malicious policy of the Bri
tilli government to keep the Irish in a state
ot ignorance ; they began by taxing news
papers, and afterwards increased the duty
on thole molt ufeful publications to
fucli an extent, that now it is not in the
power of a poor man to pnrchafe
them. Thus has the bell channel of
knowledge been choaked up by a wicked
adminiltration ; thus have the people been
kept in a Hate of barbarous ignorance, in
order to make them the more abject (laves
of despotic measures ; thus have they been
led blindfolded for centuries', and the mo
ment that an attempt is made to inform
or inftruft them in their rights, so soon as
Paine's pamphlet appears, to convince the
people that they are men and not brutesâ
up ltarts the ministry, the kings, and the
hereditary nobles of the earthâfor what ?
to prevent the reft us their fellow creatures
from leeing, hearing, tatting, finelling,
or touching the blefings of freedom and equal
Liberty, / And has not the fame game been
played already in America ?âYes, fellow
citizens of the United States, a similar game
has commenceu between you and some of
those Whom you have supposed the guar
dians of your rights. Speculation, intrigue,
felf.interest, and an inordinate delire of"
accumulating immoderate fortunes by a
momentary and usurious process, soon en
tered into their heartsâ they forgot .you,
they (lighted the complaints of their 1 own
constituents, aad, f irt a manner, disposed ot"
you tor the mammon of hnrighteoufners.
During the lirlt, and great part of the l'e
cond I'ellion ot i 789 and 1790, the prelis was
iraiiijnelled by a certain description of men
atNeu-York,who whenany writer dared to
publiih a line agaiuft tliefe characters of ava
rice, was inllantly branded with the appel
lation ot' " Enemy to the confutation."
My fellow citizens of the United State',
theconltitUtion isagood oneâbut thecoii-
Ikitution and the adminiltration of it are
tliiterenl tilings. You all know that courts
jf julticf ar e, or ought to be governed by
'aw and equity ; buc who is there amonglt
rou, Who has not, in many inftauces, fe'en
Jotli equity and law reversed in a court of
jultice t So it is with the constitution of the
United States; it may be,and I will venture 10
lfl'ert, has been reversed by the administra
tion ot the very firlt Congiefs that met un
der its auspices to legislate for the general
welfare. The inftauces 1 will mention in
ome future ninuber, but my present ad
tlrei's ftiall be confined to the attempts lately
made to ltiiie the channels of information.
It has been clearly proved that the post-
Dffice was not sacred in the years 1787 and
1788. It was as well ascertained that moll
of the presses in New-Yojk were under an
undue influence in 1789 and 1790, andfince
the arrival of Congress in Philadelphia,
when money and moneyed influence could
110 longer interrupt the bold (tream of pe
riodical information, the interested charac
ters aforementioned have adopted a favor
ite measure aud mode of attack in facing
mi mitring charatler. Personal abuse of all
hole worthy men who have been firm
snough to fleer clear of base intrigue or
ervile approbation of illegal unconstitu
tional measures, is now rel'orted to ; and
we find the true friends of the people set
up as buts tor the envenomed pens of an
alp.ring crew, who having seized on the
public vefl'el, would plunder her of the
cargo and leave only a hull for the owners.
It is therefore high time to warn the people
ot their danger, and tocaution them to be
ware or.re-electing men who were in part
nerihip wjth brokers in New-York whilst
the funding and aflumption systems were
yet depending in Congress, and who after
having dispatched pilot-boats and exprefles
to.the uninformed polleffors of public se
curities, vvith agents to purchase them up
lor "Jong, were at the fame time pleading
on the floor o. Congress in favour of laws
that should enrich themselves upon the
fruits of this surreptitious harvest, leav
ng only a ftnbble to their constituents for
111 their palt labour, for all their former
xeafuro, and for the blood of an hundred
houfand freemen facrificed in the caule of
iberty.

With rctpecX to the Secretary of State, al
though 1 itm personally unknown to him,
and pfrfeftly lure that I (hall never ask or
receive any favour from him, yet I think
it 110 11101 e than common juftice'to observe,
:n tii's piiice, that his general character, and '
molt pi obablv his real one, is the very re
verse of those ambitious persons who have

rafler. He is not aiming at any superior
port to that which he now fills with so much
credit to himfelf, and the American repub

These hints I have thrown out for the
good of my fellow citizens : and if the
people will enquire and judge for them
selves, they will find truth to be my object.

ON LOTTERIES.
THE over-weening conceit which the
greater part of men have of their own abi
lities, is an ancient evil remarked by the
philosophers and moralists of all ages. Their
absurd prefumntion in their good fortune,
has been less taken notice of. It is, how
ever, if pollible, Hill more universal. There
is no man living who, when in tolerable
health and spirits, has nut some lhare of it.
The chance of gain is by every man more
or less over valued, and the chance of los
is by molt men under-valued, and by scarce
any man, who is in tolerable health and
spirits, valued more than it is worth. That
the chance of gain is naturally over-valu
ed, we may learn from the universal suc
cess of lotteries. The world neither ever
favv, nor ever will fee, aperfeftly fair lot
tery ; or one in which the whole gain com
pensated the whole loss ; because the un
dertaker could make nothing by it. In the
ftate-iotteries the tickets are really not
worth the price which is paid by the ori
ginal fubferibers, and yet commonly fell ir
the market for twenty, thirty, and some
times forty per cent advance. The vain
hope of gaining some of the great prize;
is the sole cause of this demand. The fo
fcereft people scarce look upon it as a folly
to pay a small sum for the chance of gain
ing ten or twenty thousand pounds ; though
they know that even that small sum is per
haps twenty or thirty per cent more than
tha.chance is worth. In alottery in which
no prize exceeded twenty pounds, though
in other refperts it approached much near
erto a perfectly fair one than the common
state-lotteries, there would not be the fame
demand for tickets. In order to have a
better chance for some of the great prizes,
some people purchase several tickets, and
others,fmalllhares in a 11:11 greater number.
There is not, however, a more certaii;
proportion in mathematics, than that the
more tickets you adventure upon, the more
likely you are to be a lol'er. Adventure
upon all the tickets in the lottery, and you
l'jfe for certain ;and the greater the number
of your tickets the nearer you approach
to this certainty.

To the Freemen of Pennsylvania.
Fellow Citizens,
IT is tile peculiar happiness of a free coun
try that every citizen is at liberty to speak&
to pubtifh his sentiments on government.
As a citizen of the state of Pennsylvania,
whose inteceft and welfare are dear me. fne
having given me birth and support, I think
I may without apology hazard a few opi
nions. I lrave beheld, and not withont
concern, the diffractions in this Hate, which
have made man a foe to man, and a citizen
the tyrant of his fellow, occasioned by a dift'e
â leucein political lentiment; asifit were un
natural to tna'.iro viewthe fame thingditfer
ently from his neighbour, or to reason
upon, the fame fubjett differently, according
to the turn of his mind, and the manner in
which evidence ltrikes him. Unlettered
by party, and unprejudiced by prevailing as
falhionable doctrines, I will publilh mj
sentiments, careless of the opinions which
may be palled upon themotives, as I ftarx
acquitted with myfelf. The queftior
which engages and perhaps agitates yout
minds at prefeut is, whether conferees are
or are not proper ; and I will add,whethe;
committees of correspondence are or are
not improper ? Men often differ about a
name, and it appears to me that ,the differ
ence between a committee cifcorrefpon
deuce and a confererence. is a diiKrence
about the symbol without any dil'agree
. ment in the thing itfelf. II it is improper
to delegate your authority to a conference
is it not equally absurd to delegate it to a
committee of correspondence ? Is there
not a transfer of the right of judging foi
yourselves in both cases ? Either you mull
or must not be influenced by a committee
of correfpondence âif you are influencec
by them you surrender your right of judg-
you are not, their exigence is a nul
lity, and they are the lhadows of a (hade,
It is to no purpose to fay that the commit
tee will publilh the information they re
ceive end leave you to ast upon it ; for the
information will flow through a channel ol
their own creating, and may be different
from that, which you might receive your
selves, Is the committee without party
views, (favoritifa), or felf-intereft ? If it is
not, what will be the refiilt of your infor
mation ? If it is, as perfection is not the lot
of humanity, I ihall fuppole it more fit for
celeUial correspondence, than for tfcrreftrial
concerns. I mean no personalityâ human
nature may differ n complexion and hgurc,
but its eli'tnce is the faille. As I have pro
scribed both modes of obtaining informa
tion, a they are prettily called, it will be
expe.ed that I ihorild point out one wort
elig.ble. 'I his may be done without diffi
culty. Wc have a fre,e press, an<' l h' s i:
the best, faireft, and n?oit independent
mode of giving and receiving initruit.ou.
Conformable to my plan, I ha v Â£ framed Â£

In the formation of this ticket mecfilration

(The following is inserted verbatim from

md countrymen âThe stamp upon newspa

which it was designed. It has rendered
them so dear as to put it out of the powffr

procure them âthe consequence of which
lias been, a great defect in knowledge, and
a total unacquaintance with the progress of
society abroad, or even at home. âThough

Were this laid only on such books as are

twenty years to come, in this country), ii
it not an actual f'uppreflion of the circula

on all imported books indiscriminately, npi
even excepting the bible. The bookseller;
here generally lay 130 percent, on the fier

this; being obliged to lay a fufficient protic

IT hat been difcovcrrd by the aristocrats of En*
gland that the celebrated Paine was once a
Stay-A4uker- This charge is made for the pur
pole of invalidating his doctrine of u The Rights
of Man j" or, at lead, to prove that be had no
kuilnels to meddle with the fubjeCt. Does nol
a Stay-maker, then, pofl'efs the rights of man ?
a/ net, it mud, 1 suppose, be owing to the affini
ty between his occupation and that of a Tailor.
Jt appears however, to me, who am no aristocrat,
that could they prove upon Paine the faCt of hav
ing been even a Tailor, he might, very confident
ly, have Hiil advocated those rights. lam aware
â¢f the objection drawn from the proverbial inca
pacity of the crofs-leggcd fraternity. It may bi
faiÂ«J that a Tailor being only the n'ir.tb part of t
many is not ioterefted iu a doCtrine that relates tr
'*whole men, and ought, therefore, to have left it t(
. the pai ties concerned. This argument is/aliaci
Â©us > $ for thoughr it is admitted that, should the
.rights of man be sever so much extended, a Tai
ior's proportion of, *bem will be jutt the fame a
heretofore, viz. one.Â«wÂ«ri>, yet it i# evident hi
, fua>ntity will be increased. This being as plair
as the nose on your facÂ£, I fay no more about it
The charge above mentioned is made in " thi
.life of Paine, ** lately published in Engla.id. Witi
.alidue deference to his ..biographer, however,
am inclined to believe that Paine, instead of \
Stay-Maker, muil have beerubred a Barber. Thi
account of his education talliea*well with the pro
iiciency made by him in politics j gentlemen o
-the razor being the grea tell. .Â£>Â£Â«/ JJrtnci in thi
world. Certain it is, he has long been in th
practice of taking mtajure cf, and drtjfing crown
.Â«d heads : And, a Royal Barber.Â« let me telf you
js a not lo despicable ! Dcfpicable did
fay ? By the Rights of Man ! 1 believe th3t ai
ohice which neceflarily brings the holder of it in
to close familiarity with the person of "Back el
Majesty would be the subjeCt of envy to mam
-a iuperciiiuus aristocrat ! âTo take a Kimg b;
ihÂ« Nose !âwhat an honor !-âwhat a hapui
ness !
But I am Graving from my purpose } which wa
to remark upon the injurtice and folly of object
ing to any man the oblcurity of hir. birth or edu
cation. The injaftice of it is manifeft from th<
+b vitrus confederation that birth and education art
eircumltances which no man can controul. Bu
the folly of , when the objection is made to emi
nent characters, is extreme. Cannot these ob
jeCtors perceive that, when they mean to reproacl
such an one with the meanness of his "Befcent.
they, in effeCt, pay him the highest compliment :
since the nreateli is dÂ«e to him for having
railed himfelf to conference by his own merit i
But, great as is this tolly, there is one Kill greater;
I mean the wifb, the anxiety of persons, thus de
scended, and thus railed, to conceal their origir
from the view of the worU : As if the coatraft ol
their former with their present situation, wer<
not, initead of being difgraceful, highly honorable
to them ! Is it not a proof of extraordinary mer
it in a man to raise himfelf to coofequence, ii
fflite of ailthe obstacles thrown in hiÂ« way b;
nature, by accident, or misfortune ?
When I fee a man of merit and eminence thu:
endeavoring to screen from the company circum
fiances so honorable to himfelf, I aaftonilhec
at the power of prejudice, and pity the itnbecili
ty of the human mind \
This weakness is so common that there are fev
eminent characters who have been exempt from it
who have dared to diaw aside thÂ« veil whichever
td the fee ret of their birth j are spoken of as person
of superior liberality and enlarged underttandings,
The liberality #f such a disclosure I cannot per
ceive Nor can I admit that it is any great ef
fort of good sense to excite, by such obvious
means, additional admiration.
1 had almost forgot to inform you that in " Th<
life of Paine" be is charged with not being wortl
a Ihilling in the world And yetâwould you
believe it ?âHis faithful and impartial biogia
pher, a few pages afterwards, accuses him witl:
tne crime of not supporting his Mother ! !
Thus we fee that malicious persons, as well as
Jiars, have need of good memories.

the latter are combined and exprefled with fomi

it may be played on with keys in the manner 0

Several attempts to <bt i.ng to perfection a ma
