observance to a correspondent accuracy
in the chain of investigation, which
will, I pr:i'umc, indisputably a fail me
to trace the causes to their origin, tc
cftabliih firm prernifes, and enable me
to deduce just conclusions.

Sec. I. I shall endeavor to give a gene

The volume of air which encircle;
our globe is the secondary property in
the order of nature, and which may just
ly.be called the Secundum Mobile 111 the

It is bv this that all animated nature ex

found, &c. are conduced. "It was
formerly supposed to be a homogeneous
fluid, but from the ingenious invc(liga
tions and experiments of philosophers
and chemists of the pre'ent age, it has
been clearly si.own to be a compound
heterogeneous body, con(ifling of twe
' kinds of airs elfentially different from
each other in their properties.
These airs may be obtained in sepa
rate states by chemical procelTes, and
when obtained in those states, thc\
were supposed by the ancient chemists
to be Ample elementary bodies," but
modern chemists have proved there is
another component part highly elfential
and very different from the other pro
perties of the atmosphere, denominated
by M. Lavoisier, the Caloric principle:
this principle, when combined with the
other component parts of the atmos
phere, keeps it in solution and reduces
it to the aeriform state in which we
breathe it.âl conceive the caloric prin
ciple to be wholly dependent on the Sun
lor its exiftcnce, and if there were a to
f . tal fubduction or abftratlion of the Calo
ric from the other component parts ol
the atmosphere, it would be converted
into a fclid mals, produce a confufion in
the revolutions of the planetary fyflenfts.
and Eruftrate the very delignsof nature.
This Caloric principle, for the mofi
part, exists diflufed wi;h the other pro
perties of the atmosphere in a quiekent
or latent state, but may be rendered fen
hblc both by natural and artificial pro
cefTes.
â¢â¢ These component parts may be de
compoiccl, i'ep,-rated from each other,'
and compounded with other bod es,
and made to aii'ume very different forms
and properties from those which the*
pvOeifrd in their original state of com
bir.ation.

exist in a combined state, in the propor
tion of 27 parts of dephlogifticated and
r > parts of mephitic or impure air, in an
hundred parts of atmospheric air. nc
proportions here fpccihed are boweyei
frequently varied by the combination
of certain causes and circumftani.es
ducing different results. It is this de
phlogifticated part of the air, calleu by
M. Lavoisier and other French chemiits,
the oxygen gas, that supports animal lite,
combuition, &c. the mephitic or azotic
gas, is that part which kills animals,
extinguilhes flame, and is remarkable
for its levity ; this, in respect to its Spe
cific gravity, is as one to twelve wiLh the
former.
The position I presume being granted,
that the density of the atmospheric an,
is in the direst ratio to the preilure cf the
(aper-incumbent volume, conlequenily,
the quantity of the oxygenous principle
in a given (pace, is mathematically (qua
red by the above proportion ; therelore
the nearer we are lo the furface of tire
earth, the more of this oxygenous pait
we breathe : This obviously llluftrates,
how wifely the creator has disposed all
things for the conveniency of animated
nature. This analysts of the atmoi
phere by M. Lavoisier and others, if it
be just, may perhaps help to resolve ma
ny phenomena in the arcana of natui~,
open a w ide avenue to the clear percep
tion of truth, and enable us to .travel
with increafmg pleasure "Crooki-a
paths of Icience.
Having given a general (and perhaps
a true)defcription of the atmofpl.ei e and
its component parts, I proceeu. to
the investigation of the tecond head.
Sec. 11. I P.:.'ill point out the chan>
ges the atmolpliere undergoes at certain
leafons of the year, lrom the combined
operation of certain fpecilic cauies.
The annual revolution of tae earth
round the 'Sun clearly reiolves the cauies
of the various seasons on the c! Cerent
parts of the globe, and as this planet in
the summer season is delcendmg in its
orbit, at the fan-,e time in conjanthon
with the inclination of the Sun, it pro
duces what is called the lummer Sol
flicc* âA little before this period the

id. There are many fxtuations in A
; erica and in other parts of the world
hat particularly favour this change ; a
ew of those mod favourable I shall
:ame. Thele are the countries on the
anks of the Delaware river from Tren
on to Cape May ; the Eastern Shore of
Maryland, many parts of tlie state ot
/lrgmia,South-Carolina, and Georgia ;
,-reat part of South America : beiides
hefe there are numberleis situations in
4Jia and Africa that conspire to.destroy.
he balance of the atmosphere.
2d. The circumstances attendant on
hefe situations are the vast trails of low
narfhy grounds partially cultivated, on
vhich there are great quantities of flag
rant water and vegetable rubbish. It is
n the latter part of July and the firft
>f August in this latitude (40-N.) that a
argc part of the low ground-vegetables
;ave their fir ft growth and fall to the
â¢arth, but this progreflive advancement
f vegetable life is varied in proportion
.0 the degree of latitude, and kind of
oil, in which these local situations may
jo. It appears evident that the balance
if the atiTiofphere aiuft be materially
ffe&ed in confcquence of tlie finifhed
rrowth of a great part of the vegetable
in-dom : for M. Foarcroy obierves

stored to its natural equlibrium. Bc
(ldes these causes mentioned above
which destroy the equilibrium of the
itmofphere, there are others equally
conducive to that effcct. These are
those vegetables, which fall into the
stagnant waters and undergo the differ
:nt fiages ot fermentation. The cir
jumftances neceifary to promote the dif
ferent procclles ot fermentation, are the
;hree followingâl ft. A certain degree
:>f moillure, 2d. moreor lefsof heat, and
jd. the contact ot air.
The inteibine motion which is occasi
oned in all the stages of fermentation, is
excited by the above conditions, and
which totally changes the properties of
:hofe vegetables. In thio elaborate pro
ofs there is a considerable degree of
heat generated, a different l'ubftance
produced, the oxygenous principle of
;he atmosphere is ablorbed, which is one
jf the ci: ,-ntial component parts of the
new prod jced fubilance : In the time
of fermentation there is a decomposi
tion taking place, and a considerable
quantity of fixed air evolved ; this air
does not ascend like inflammable air in
confcquence of its great weight, confe
qucntly circulates over the fermenting
body, and is very pernicious to animal
life, extinguishes flame, &.c.
An atmosphere impregnated with this
fpccies of air, may be dilcovered by the
dullness of the burning of tapers, flam
bcaus ":c. it is observed that tapers dc
not burn with that livelynefs in low
iv.arfky situations at certain seasons oi
the year, as they do in higher and dry n
filiations,J this is a fait direclly in
point, that the balance of the atmos
phere is destroyed.
Over these extensive low grounds
where the process fermentation it

glebe, depend for their existence upon,
the fame causes, and it will be well to
remark,that the great floods of rain com
mence in those months, when there is
the greatest want of balance existing
in the atmosphere. jJ/jfk
An accumulation of the calorie prin
ciple or matter of fire, and a dense atmos
phere are highly incompatible with each
other, and cannot poflibly both exist in
the fame place at the fame time.

Subjlance of Mr. GERRY's Speeih on
Mr .Bourne'smotion of M >y)for
ajfuming iherefdue of the State Debts :
Mr. GERRY observed, when
this question was last under considera
tion, he had followed gentlemen who
were opposed to it in their arguments
through the extensive field of the consti
tutionality, policy and equity of the
meal'ure, and that he now should con
fine himfelf to the datemcrit of some
facts and a few observations thereon.
It appears, he laid, by official re
ports, that the unaffumed deljts of the fe
deral dates, are as follows :
dollars.
Of New-Hampshire 4 3 5Â° i

It also appears, that the following
fittitious debts have been aii'umed, viz.
Dols.
For Pennsylvania 10 1 >

North-Carolina 20; ,-j
Total 1262818
From this statement it is inanifed that
u-hildf -veralofthe states are exonerated
of the debts contrasted for the support
of the war, and others have but a small
proportion of them unaifumed, the
dates of South Carolina and Muffachu
i'ctts are pressed wiih a heavy debt of
nearly two millions of dollars each.â
This, he laid, is a grievance that re
quires immediate redress, and should
Congress rife without providing it, they
would forfeit that confidence in their
generosity, honor and justice, which had
been ever entertained by the citizens of
MafTachufetts âNo gentleman, he said,
could deny, that the exertions of that
state in support of the independence of
the United States, had equalled those of
any other state in the union ; the do
cuments would prove that MalTachufetts
had not been exceeded by any of her
sister dates in the amount of her advan
ces, or in the economy of her expendi
tures ; and her exertions to fink the
debt, which commenced with the debt
itfelf, were finally so great as to have
produced convulsions in the state.
The unaffumed debt of that state, from
the bed information which he could ob
tain,""was in the hands of the substantial
yeomanry thereof, who, having never
{"peculated in the funds, were original
holders. âMost of these, either by art,
or by accident, had been mifinformed
relative to the time for receiving sub
scriptions to the loan, and had thus been
prevented from having a pari of their
debts assumed. It will be, therefore,
peculiarly hard, whild Cor.grcfs aro
calling on thisclafsof citizens, for theii
proportion of contributions to pay the,deuis tl.ua to r/,.ier?, th ' no provision is
Kiade for the payment of their just-de
mand : and tha cafe is aggravated, when
it is c< : "red that their contributions
arc net confined to rnal, but are extend
ed to fictitious debts, and that whilst
they are uni iftly required to pay inter
est on >he latter, their just claims arere-
Je&ed for interest on the former. It is
-till more grievous, when it isconfider
cd that whilst government refufe to re
imourie the sums ad"anced by Mafl'a
chul;tts for the defence of her filter
states, ten or fifteen years past, she is
called on for large fuins to defend their
frontiers against favagc incursions.
What mult be the feelings of the citi
zens of MalTachufetts, when they are in
formed, that Perinfytvania, whole fron
tiers are now invaded, and who is re
ceiving; the interest of an imaginary debt
OO _ .
of above a million of dollars, is calling
on them for supplies to carry on the
â war, and at the fame time refufes to dif
ch trge their advances for her defence,
during the late war P Indeed , some of
the members ttf\this flats have been al
ways liberal on the great question of
a ''umJt:o:i, and nave uniformly lupport
ed it, b.;t others have opposed it, and
t.ie votes of the former have been ren
dered ineffcdtual by those of the latter.
Under such ci:cam{|atices, would not
the members of South-Carolina and
MalTachufetts have been juftified in re
fusing aids for support of the Indian
war, and in defeating this measure, by
joining in the opposition to it ? Would
they not have been warranted in thus
compelling PennfylvaiÃa to have de
fended herfelf by her Jbwti resources,
and to have exhibited her claims for
fupportfng this war, to be adjusted
with those of other states for supporting.
the revolution P True it is, that in such
an event many of the innocent citizens
of the weltern frontiers would have fal
len a facrifice, and some of their own
representatives would have been charge
able for the consequences ; but so far
were the members of South Carolina,
MalTachufetts, and other creditor States
from adopting such policy, that they
have advocated the measures fir defend
ing the weltern frontiers, and arc now
to be sent home in disgrace to their
constituents, for having spent a great
. O 1 O
part of the lemon in pursuing rational
measures to promote the welfare of those
slates. who have had no disposition to
dojufticc to the creditor Itates. Could
he have rorefeen, he laid, such an event
he would not have taken his feat in the
house this leflion but he Itill hoped,
as it was well known and ascertained
beyond 5 doubt, that MalTachufetts
would have a claim against the Uni
â¢ted States far exceeding the fumpropo-j
fed to be afTumed for her, that the house
would consider the fub;eÂ£t in a candid
ipanner ; that the members would di
-veft themfclvcs of local conhderati
ons, and that they would adopt mea
sures confident with liberality and jul
tice. Indeed, he laid, it was for the in
terest even of the debtor states to al
fume the debts, because, when the ac
counts arc liquidated, the debts due to
the -creditor dates will not be due
from the union, but from the debtor
slates, and if the union is to be taxed
for those debts, the creditor states will
be obliged.to contribute to the reim
buricment of advances, which they
have made for the other Itates. This
cannot be done confidently with justice,
and will therefore be a source of great
uueafinefs and embarrassment to govern
ment : whereas, if the debts of the citi
zens of the states are now alTumed, and
.the claims of the states are thus dimi
nished, the cause of the embarralTment
will in a great measure be prevented.
Jle hoped therefore, the motion would
be adopted, and that the refiduc of the
ilatc debts would be now alTumed.

Notwithstanding the continental newf

The engagement was in consequence of an

onjeftured that several such were employ

We can {late with certainty, that the

The following is the answer given by
Prince Kaunitz (fint minister to Leo
pold 2d. ) to the rrquilition of the
King of France, That the late Fmperor
(hould recognize the sovereignty of the
French nation, the freedom of the King,
and the legality of his acceptance of the
constitution. (This requilition was to have
been presented to the Emperor on the very
day he died. ) " The King of Hungary,
having fully adopted the political system of
the late Fmperor, he will explain himfelf
with the franknefs that becomes a great
power. The King of France complains of
the afi'embling of troops in Germany. No
aifembiing of troops there i known, that
ought to be considered as an indication oi
holtility'. Troops are afiembled in much
greater numbers in France. The King of
Hungary and the Princes of Germany
may perhaps think it proper toaflenibic ttii'i
greater numbers to maintain the internal
peace of their several states, dilturbed by
the examples of the troubles in France,
and the criminal machinations of the Jaco
b n party ; but these Princes will never
ronfent to t : e up their own hands in this re
[peJt, which no power has a right to re
quire of them.
" With respect to the engagements and
concerns between the court of Vienna and
the molt refpeÂ£l.able powers of Europe,
that court will continue to maintain them,
till the French nation, adopting a milder
course, (hall repel the insinuations of afan
guinary faction that excites tumults and
acts of violence against the liberty 9f the

From a view of the preftnt condition of

who would be a king ? â Certain it is, that
. for a few years pad more attacks have been
made upon persons of royal description
than for a whole ccntnry before. -Age,
idiotifm, and female imbecility have alike
felt a preternatural impulse to defiroy
them. Rnfty cafe-knives, air-guns, blud
geons, and brick-bats, are constantly cm
ployed against them with so much invete
racy, that the poor crown-holders have
aimofl as pitiful a life of it as cocks were
wont to lead 011 Shrove Tuefday---Super
added to all this is the deplorable misfor

OFF CM I. COMPENSATION.
AS to the offices of which any civil go
vernment may be composed, it matters but
little by what names they are described. In
flie routine of bufinef whether a man be
(tiled a prefidcnt, a king, an emperor, a
lenator, or any thing el lie, it is impoflibie
that any service he can perform, can merit
from a nation more than ten thousand
pounds a year ; and as no man fl.ouid be
paid beyond his services, so every man of a
proper heart will not accept more. Public
money ought to be touched with the molt
scrupulous consciousness of honor.' It is
â lot the produce ps riches only, but of the
hard earnings of labour and poverty. It is
drawn even from the bitterneO of want and
misery. "Not a bept ar pafl'es or perishes

that has not produced follie new mercenary
pplicaVion. liven the physicians' bills have

tems, nothing is to be looked for but what
has already happened and as to reforma
tion, whern ver it comes, it mult be from
the nation, and not from the government.
On TAXATION.
WHF.N - V' R nixes are proposed, the
country is nmufed by the plauiible language
nf taxing luxuries. One thing is called a
luxury at one time, and something ell'e at
another ; but the real luxury does not
conlift iu the article, but in the means of
procuring it, and this is always kept out
of fight.âl know not why any plant or
herb of the field fliould be a greater luxury
in one country than another, but an over
grown eflate in either is a luxury at all
times, and as such is the proper object of
taxation.. It is, therefore, right to take
tliofe kind tax-making gentlemen upon
their own word, and argue 011 the princi
ple themselves have laid down, that of tax
ing luxuries. If they, or their champion,
Vlr. Burke, who, I fear, is growing out of
date like the man in armour, can prove
T hat an eftatc of twenty, thirty, or forty
thousand pounds a year is not a luxury, I
will give up the argument. Admitting that
any annual sum, fay for instance, one ijw
laud pounds is nectflary orfufficient Wfwe
support of a family, confequ#ntly the fe
coud thousand is of the nature of a luxury,
the third ftillmorefo, and by proceeding
on, we shall at last arrive at a sum that
may, not improperly, be called a prohibit
â  ble luxury. It would be impolitic to set
bounds to property acquired t>y industry,
arid therefore it is. right to place the pro
hibition beyond the probable acquilition to
which induftrv can extend ; but there
ought to be a limit to property, or the ac
cumulation of it by bec)ucit. Itfhouldpafs
'n some other line. The richest in every
nation have poor relations, and tliofe often
very near in cphfanguinity.

The TKAVELLiNC CAT.
"The fofluwihg account ( fays a Maryland
Correspondent) I received from a person oi the
ftridtelt veracity, and tho' it appears f mewhat
extraordinary, it may be depended on as a t'a<3."
Late in the \ ear 1791 a cat was taken on board
a vessel in tiie river Potomack, and brought round
through'Ghefapeak bay in;o'th- Patuxent, a cir
cuitous distance of more than fifty mile?. Upon
being landed file was conveyed co a hotjffi three
or four miles distant from tlie last mentioned rjvei
in Calvert County, where }he continue! fcveral
weeks. While here, the cat incurred her own
er's oifpleafure by regaling hcrfelf with fomechoice
provisions that had been let apart for his own use,
in conl'ecjuence of which ihe was fentenccd to re
ceive a whipping, which was accordingly execu
ted. Not reliihing this affront, (he forfpok the
imuf', and returned to the place from which
she had been originally taken, a distance of be
tween twenty and thirty miles in a direct line,
in the prosecution of which jaunt the ftomachful
animal mult have pafl'ed the Patuxent river, at
lead two miles wide, but then frozen over j it
being in February when the fait occurred.
The manner in which the animal was convey
ed, and the distance of the place it left from that
to which it returned, evinces the exigence of a
faculty in the brute creation, which, tho* rarely
exercised by them,cannot be controverted or de
nied. I cannot persuade myfe fit can be wholh
attributed to inftindh Man endowed with supe
rior faculties in other refpe&s, mull, in this,
yield to the superiority of irrational animals, as
similar fads have occurred with regard to other
tribes of that part of nature's* animated creation
we take upon ourselves to call brutal.
