leletting virtuous men for their represen
tative.. If Congress have done a great ma
ny good thiiiv . f'uice tile adoption of our
prelent excellent conflitution, it was no
more than their duty, and their conltitu
cuts will reward thole who beik deserve

already have had the ambitious few ranked

mow TIME for you to art with that true
'epublican spirit, which Ihould never deep
in the brealt of an independent federal
elertor. But there are other dangers to
which you are exposed, of which you
Ihould a!Co be aware. There are a Jet of
writers, of no small ability, and of infinite
fubclety, who are constantly alVailing you
with diihoneft dortrines, contrary to the
principle; of found policy, altogether in
compatible with the Ipirit of freemen, and
diametrically oppolite to the true interest of
the United States. Such arc the dortrines
publilhed some time lince, under the title ot
Dtjcoufet of Davilla, Publico.'a, An American,
&c. ! &e. To the authors of thofc pieces, I
am willing to give a just proportion of ap
plause, for their abilities and industrious
perlever.'.nee, if they were really actuated,
as they fay they were, by patriotic motives;
bull when you lee writers of some ingenui
ty Hart up' in defence of hereditary fuccef

choak the circulation of knowledgeâthen
it is time to offer a hand in unmalking those

in reply to the putting paragraphia of a cer
tain Gazette, 1 will quote a sentence from
Hume's idea of a perfect commonwealth â
" There are no characters so pernicious as
political projectors, if they have power ;
nor so conitmptitle, if they want it." This
'entiment is certainly applicable only to the
junto, and not to meâl have proposed no
political fchcmes; I barely confine my en
deavours to the subjeCt of free election and
lioneft representation. Let the people al
ways be feciired in those, and they may defy
the machinations of an holt of machiavelian,
manufacturing, banking, speculating, or
'itulary projectors. The lajl mentioned party
(hould not excite our abhorrence the less,
becanfe iliey failed in their attempqlâ
Crimes (hould be eltimated by thj intnifton
of the offender, not the conlequences of the
offence. Neither weakness in underftatid
ing nor obfeurity in life, (hould shelter info
'eme or faCtion from the infamy they cle
fcrye: but such are the operations of the
human mind, that we frequently overlook
the baseness of the attempt, merely because
it has failed of success, and congratulate
aurfelves upon our security, without giving
yent to the honest indignation which lUould
turn its vehemence againlt those who (hould
sndanger it. The laboured publications of
ophHtical writers, when narrowly exami
ned, will be readily rejected ; but it mull
;ive pain to every phil-Tophic mind to fee
talents employed in the rnin of our country.
I (hall conclude this letter with a quotation
from Bacon : " When a Safefoul, amind too
weak to discover the truth, knowingly al
lents to a falfehood, it obeys its iuitinCt;
but, that a philosopher can become the
apostle of an error, that he docs not take for
the truth, 1 doubt, and my reason is unan
swerable ; that it is the deli re every author
has of personal fame and glory! but, a re
nown acquired by error, :s a phantom of
glory, that is driven away by the tirft rays
of truth and reason." By this personal
fame, I presume. the author meant that
kind of fame, which is pursued by men who
have only in view their own aggrandizement
and that of their family. Men v. ho have in
America ventured to advance an opinion,
That a nation cannot be rover ntd by free rcprefen
tation, but mujl be governed by corruption, and the
welt-bo n few. Such fame, however, is very
diltinct from the glory of a nation, and per
fectly the reverie of what I underltand by
the words general wellfare. That the lalt
mentioned fentime it has been avowed by
I'oine persons of monied influence, is known
10 many ; and with regard to the former, it '
is contained in the discourses of Davilla;
where the practice is applauded in molt en

An extract of a letter from a gentleman
at Fort Waliiington, to his friend in this
place, dated the 15th inltant, mentions, that
news has been received at St. Vincenries,
by an Indian sent from Major Hamtrainck
to L'Anguillfe (the village dellroyed by
General Wilkinfon last August) that a par
ty of Shawaneie had fallen in with, and
murdered a party of three or four men, not
very distant from one of our fortifications;
that these men bore ti (lag; that the Indians
conveyed the papers found in their pollef
<ion to some white men, who could read ;
that these papers turned out to contain a
talk from a Big Captain, which made the
Indians regret their conduct. From this
report, it is probable one of the flags sent
out by General Wilkinfon has been inter
cepted and cut off, but which is uncertain.
There exiltsa ftrtmg presumption that Gol.
Harding was not of this party. There were
three Hags sent outâthe tirft conflfted of
three men; the fceond. Major Trueman's,
of the fame number; and Col. Harding's,
who was attended by one man only.
A letter from Paris (in the new French
settlement) dated July 17, Hates, That in
telligence had been received at Fort-Jefter
fon, of the death of Major Trueman, Mr.
Freeman, Dcbachi and Jarrat. That this
information was brought by two prisoners,
who were labouring in a cornfield, and
made their escape. The one was taken
priloner at the time general Harmar was
defeatedâthe other is William Duer, of
Captain Buchanan's company of levies.â
They further inform, that on the 2jth of
June a party of Indians took eight men pri
soner?, who were making hay near Fort-
Jefferfon ; that when they had moved the
prisoners some distance from the Fort they
divided themâfour were given to the Chip
pewas, lour to the Shawanefc : that the
Shawanefe burnt the four unfortunately af
togned to them ; that the Chippewas took
theirs home, to the intent of making la
bourers of them ; that the Indians are de
termined for war, and will not treat, but
will kill every white person that attempt:
to go to them, either with or without a Hag ;
that their prelent plan is to cut off the escorts
of provisions dsftincd to the out-polls, and
by that means oblige die troops ltationed
there to furreilder ; and that for this pur
pole they keep two spies conltantly out.
Official accounts received from l'"ort-
Washington, Hate, that, norw ithftanding the
pai ific overtures of the United States, the

My dear Countrymen,
THE advice which the Confnl Ccneral Of

not suspend, at lealt retard, the armaments

This delay may produce misfortunes of the

ved, as it is at present, of the usual produc
tions of its (oil. We ought, my dear coun

weak resources may permit: therefore, I

receive an equal proportion of the aftifl

sent to New-Yoik lliouid be appropriated to

some may be sent to the Northern Province.
Whac is collected at Philadelphia will

THERE are three modes of commu
nication, upon the fubjedt of the
approaching eledtiqn, contemplated by the
citizens. The full is through the medi-,
uni of a board of conferrees, vested with
the power of fixing the perforis who arc to
represent us in Congress ; the second thro'
the medium of a committee of correspon
dence, employed to colledt the names of
all the candidates, <vithout making a dis
crimination or feledhon ; and the third is
through the medium of the press, offering
the sense of individuals, in the shape of a
tieket, to the consideration of the public.
The avowed objedt, and the probable con
itquences of pursuing the iiift of those
modes, are fufiicient to condemn it. When
it was publicly declared by one of the fan- J
guine advocates for the appointment of
conferrees, ,l that he should be ashamed
not to be of a party," may wc not fairly
infer, that his object, at least, is to frame
a party ticket; and fhonld the wealthy
and powerful be able, thus industriously,
to divert the cuircnt of popular eledtions
into a new and unnatural channel, who
does not anticipate thclofsof that equality
of privilege, the subversion of that com
mil uity of rights which the language of re
publican governments attaches to the per
fion of the humblett, as well as the proud
est citizen ?
The fccond mode does not, indeed, as
sume tiiis inauspicious alpedt ; for, if the
committee honellly execute theii trust ac
cording to their own conftrudtion of it,
their correspondence is nothing more than
a vehicle of information ; and their report
of names can have no more effedt in pre
ferring or influencing the votes of their
fellow- citizen*, than the publication of a
diredtory, or any other alphabetical lift of
the inhabitants of the state. But, I am
apprehenlive that the delays incidental to
a correspondence of this nature, may, at
the present late hour, prevent its being ex
tensively ufeful. The city and the neigh
bouring countics may derive a benefit from
it, but the citizens of Luzerne and Walh
ington will hardly hear of the lilt before
they aie called on to vote.
Hence it is, -Sthat I am induccd to
adopt tne third mode ; and to present you
with a ticket, which, after much impartial
consideration, appears in my opinion, to
comprize as great a portion of personal
ta enta and integrity, of feeling and know
ledge of the intereit of the state, and of at
tachment and refpedt towards the Union,
as Pennsylvania can furnifli. In my dif
tributiou I have not attended, more than
an impartial arrangement requires, to any
rule founded on local situation f but, it
will be allowed, that if the qualifications
of the candidates are equal, the principle j
of representation jullifies my giving to
each part of the Rate a reasonable (hare
in the formation of the ticket j and, it wili
be observed, that in doing this, I have le
ledted those charadiers, who, not ojily at
the present period, hut throughout the re
volution, have, in every political lervice,
been honored, trusted, and employed by
the neighbourhood in which they reside, â 
and wheie their virtues and their abilities !
mult certainly be belt proved and known.

to let them pass unheeded. I much ap

it unites all interells, and I (incevely hope
that it will meet with the deliberate con

On the improbability of the mounUuns on tht
earth having originated from the rotation
of the earth, producing a centrifugal
force.
fTranfiated from the French J
THE motion of the earth around the
fun is supposed by philosophers to proceed
from an attradtive and projective pow"
combined, producing a uniform progress
of the earth in her orbit. But it appears
to me that the movement of a man walk
ing upon the ground might as well be ac
counted for upon these two principles as
iTis motion of til. earth. The centrifugal
and centripetal powen appear to me tc
have no more real exigence in the voi<
space of the heavens, than the imaginary
circles of the zodiac and the equator. How
ever capable thefs fuppvWd laws may bi
of answering every purpose, they are it:
fadt nothing more than a mere fiaffolding;
imagined by men of genius, whereby tt
ertti the fabric of natural science, but
wiiich never yet enabled them to penetrate
into the fanftuary of nature, any mori
than the fcari. I ling which we make use o:
in building our churches, enables us to pe
netrate into the fpi: it and efficacy ol tru<
leligion These combined powers hav(
110 more to do in causing the courfcs anc
motions cf the planets than the circles o:
the fphercare concerned in limiting theii
various degrees of eccentricity. In fadt
these supposed powers are no more thai
nere signs, invented to account for ohjcCti
. .iey ought to reprefent,-'tl>e.ja:ue as othei
arbitrary ligns, ot human inventiou.
If it was the centrifu al motion that threw
tip mountains upon the globe when it was it
a liquid Hate, i litre ou lit in reality to bi
mountains upon the earth vallly highei
than the Aii ies of Peru and Chili. Thi
mountain Chimboraco, near the equator
& which isthehigheft wethereknowof, ha:
only 3220 feet of elevation, or, according
to others, 3350 (for the calculations dc
riot exadtly agree in this particular).â
This degree of elevation is less sensible up
on the earth than the third patt ot a line
would be upon a globe fix feet diameter
Now a wnafs of melted metal, cast in an}
proportion whatever, would exhibit acci
dental protuberances much more consider
able on itsfurface, (in refpeft toitsdiame
ter) than any adtual inequalities 011 the
furface of the earth. Look at the rough
ness on a bit of the drof? of iron : whal
horrid figures and chasms t len would have
been formed on a globe of heterogeneous
melted matter of nearly three thoufanc
leagues in diameter? âAccording to Cai
fini, the moon, which is a much fmallei
globe than the earth, has mountains neai
three leagues in heightâBut what woulil
have been tliofe f veilings and cavities, il
we add to this heterogeneous mal's in a
melted state, a centrifugal force produced
by the rotation of the earth on it 3 axis ?
I believe this force, which mud have
afl'ed with most energy at the equator, in
stead of forming a globe would have pro
â¢liiccd bodies similar to the glass plates or
scales which we fee blown up in the glala
house.
The diameter of the earth is not great
er under the equator than under the meri
diasc ; nor are its mountains at or near
the equator more elevated than elfwl.ere.
The celebrated Amies of Peru do not take
their rife at the equator, but several de
grees beyond it to the fouthvvard, and ex
tending from thcnce to Peru. Chili, and
the Magcllannic regions, terminate at tlu
fifty fifth degree of south latitude, neai
Terra del Fuego where they front upon
the ocean in a promontory of eternal ice
of a stupendous height. In this whole
extent, they have no opening till yoi;
come to the ftreights of Magellan, form
ing in all other places an immense bulwark,
with pyramids of snow, inacceflible U
men, beasts, and even to birds. On the
contrary the mountains about the Till),
nus of Panama, in the vicinity of the line,
are not comparable to the Andes in height.,
and are even so far inferior, that Lord An
'on, who coalled the whole of South Ame
rica, relates, that when he came into this
latitude he experienced the moll violent
heats "owing (fays he) to the air not be
â ng any longer refrrfhed by the tempera
ture of the atmosphere fmm the higl
mountains of Chili and Peru".
The highell mountains in arc
conilantly found out of the torrid zone
That valt chain of mountains cnlled Tau
rus and Imaus begin in Africa at moun
Atlas, about the 30th de gree of nortl
latitude, and tiaverfe all \ftica, as wel
as Afi-, between t ; .l' and 40th de
grees of north h-t'i: *heir fuminit:
being generally e. â  " ' t- .oughout th<
whole of this vail ex ent v\ snows tha l
are never thawed, which circumflance o
itfelf is proof of a y c t'-ie eleva
tion. Mount nÂ«*t, n k-'spu
of this chain, is perhaps of a greater heigh
ti.anaiiy mountain of t'- w.>ild. il on:
may judge by the length of the time i
took Tuurnrfort, and othet travellers, tÂ«
ascend from the base to the foot of thi
snows whieh covered the lummit ; 1.1 â  -:
from the d'fbnce at which it may be per
ceived, which is at lead f days |onviKy o
the caravans, or about one hundred an'
twenty miles. The Pico of Teneriffe ma}
be teen 40 leagues. The mour.
tains, in Norway, called by some tin
northern Alps, are seen 50 leagues at sea
and, according to a learned Swede, theii
height is three ihouftnd fathoms. Tin
Picos of Spitfberg, New Zeland, thi
Alps, the Pyrennees, the Glaciers o
Switzerland, where ice is seen the whol
year round, are very high, and for tin
moll part remote from the equator. Nei
ther are their dire&ions uniformly pa
rallel to this circle, as rnuft have beci
the cafe, had the elevations of the eartl
called mountains been caused by the dinr
nal rotation of the globe; for, if the chair
of mountains known by the name of 1 111
rus extend:', in the old world, from well tt
cad, that of the Andes in the new conti
:,ent rum from north to south. Othei
chains again have other diredlions.âBut
if this supposed centrifugal power in tlx
earth could heretofore raise mountains ti
the height we now fee them, why is ii
that at this time it is not capable of eleva
ting a flraw into the air ? fuppoliug this
principle to exill, no body whatever conk
remain on the furface of the earth â"Bu!
bodies are fixed (fays the Newtonian)
by the centripetal force, that is, by the
power of gravity."âl answer, if the.
power of gravity confine:; all bodies to the
level of the furface of the earthy why did
not the mountains themselves also obey
this law, having been originally in a liquid
Hate?âl fufpedl no answer can be made
to this lall difficulty.
