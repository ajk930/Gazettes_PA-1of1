The Minilter of Naples,
The objeÂ£l was to fettle a general plan
for the profecntion of the war, and, as Du
mourier's defection had produced no ijia
terial alteration, to determine whether tin
combined armies Ihould again attemjit the
invaiion of France.orby confining theFreuch
-within their own frontier, and cutting them
off from external communication, leave
the reltoration of monarchy to the effort'
of the loyalilts within the Kingdom, and
the natural progress of difconterit atifmg
from diltrefs among the people.
The ill success of the campaign of last
year, had taught the Aultrians and Pruffi
ansthe difficulties that must attend entering
France ; and produced declarations, that
it was not their intention to diftare a form
of government for the French, but to pre
vent the effects of those licentious princi
ples which tended to the fubverfiou of eve
ry eltablifhed government.
BytheCongrefs.however.it was resol
ved to commence a plan of active operati
onsagainft France, and instead of the chi
merical projeit of marching direftJy to Pa
ris, to beliege at once as many as pollilile
of ;he â ftruig places on the frontier, which
*.\ ill block up er call off the greatest part of
the republican troops from the interior of
the kingdom, and leave the rovalifts with
in it, without ninth opposition. If these
places fall, they will be immediately occu
pied by the troops of the combined powers,
and serve as points to ast from according
to circumstances, whilltt'ne fleets ot Eng
land, Holland and Spain, are to lorm a
chain of cruisers round the coast, ready to
favour the royalifls wherever they appear,
"and to cut otf all supplies by sea, as the ar
mies will do by land. 7 has attacked and
hemmed in on all lides, with a ffrong par
ty to a.-t againlt them at home, the republi
cans, it is hoped, mult be soon subdued.
The cessation of holtilities was declared
at an end, and the allies immediately com
menced their operations.
Such we underltand to be the plan agreed
upon at this memorable Congress, in the
execution of which (jrtat Britain is to al
lilt with all her forces by sea and land.
Ofirs practicability weprefumenotto give
any opinion ; but from [he conduct ot the
allies in other cases, we have little doubt
but that ifihegai rTons on the French fron
tiers lliould fall, the Aultrians will take
podellion of French Flanders. Lorraine.

P, utfia will have an equivalent in another

hxrrait of a letter from Antwerp dated
April 8.
" His royal hichnefs the duke of York
from JBergen-op Zoom, the prince of O
range, the hereditary prince, and lord
Ankland, from the II prince de Co
bo urg from Mons, with general KnobelN
dirf (of PTuffla,) and count Metternich,
hive arrived liere to consult on the plan of
operations to be followed in the eniuing
eanip-iin.
" The deputies put under nrreft by Du
monrier, and sent to prince Cobourg, are
at Maeftricht. âDumourier with young E
galite, who now calU himfdl the duke de
Chartres, and his filter, Mademoiselle D'
Orleans, are at Mons.
" The army which general Dumourier
lately commanded, is in the utmolt conlu
fion. mid it is" even said entirely dispersed,
without any regular leader. T hat gene
ral perfuadec' him Pel f, from the personal
attachment (hewn him by his army, that he
mignt promise himfelf their support, to the
extent of his wilhes, in the project he had
5o Hied. He was, however, mistaken.
He had advanced as far as Camhray, on
the r >ad to Paris, when he found his army
deferring h m ; the artillery tirlt forfook
him, th n then ti anal guards. He then
hi: - ngued the tioopi ot the line, who, in
return, i .formed ii in, that, notwithstand
ing their lore to him as their general, and
as a brave f >ldier, they were determined,
to a m in, nether to fight againflf their coun
try, nor co violate that conftitutiou which
:lity hid sworn to maintain.
" General Dumourier finding that he
could not depend upon the army, immedi
ately fit out with jonng-Egaiite at the head
ot two regiments of horse, and took the
road to.Mons. He was, however, so close
ly purftied by a party who followed him,
that he was ..bfolutely obliged, to fight his
â vay. ...
"It is said, that Dumourier intends to
ecruit among the royalifh, who now are
very numerous in France.!!!
" The Aultrians havelaid siege to Conde,
and expect to have made conliderable pro
'l-efs in France before theend of fx weeks.
The French garrison that were in Breda
have made a requitition to be allowed a
Itrong escort, led they lliould be murdered
by the Brnbanters, who are highly incensed
against the French.
" The people of this place, when the
French attempted, before the arrival of the
Anflrians, to carry off the images and plate
iiom the churches, afl'embled and declared
o general MarefTe, that if they did not im
mediately replace the flatties, they would
rake exemplary vengeance upon them.â
This had the desired effect-"
Dumourier wrote from Mons, requeflinÂ£
permission to attend the Congress which
wasrefufed him.
When he fÂ«t out for Paris, he wrote to
the prince of Saxe-Cobourg, that he could
I depend on the garrison of Conde, and that,
if the AuUriaus would approach it at a par
titular time, it would certainly be deliver
ed up to them. A detachn ent was sent
according to his directions, the command
ing officer of which, after waiting some
time, and receiving no proportion from the
sent parties to fcuur the country
lor intelligence. Soon after information
was brought him from Mous that Dumou
i er vas arrived there, and that the plan
had miscarried.
Duinourier sent notice to the prince of
Saxe-Cobourg, that on the firlt appearance
cf difl'atisfailion he had founded his army
regiment by regiment, and found that none
would Hand by him but two regiments of
cavalry, making together about 1 100 men,
with which he had made his escape. He
,fcund it impracticable to deliver up Valen
ciennes and Conde, but exprefl'ed hopes,
that the garrison ol" Lisle would open the
gates. MareiTe, on whofr talents and abi
lities to serve the cause of royalty, he be
llowed a high encomium, he thought would
join with thegarrifon ol Antwerp ; and the
g ;rrifons of Breda, and Gertruydenberg,
he was confident would implicitly obey his
orders.
These were probably the felf-delufions
of a man, who was Hill willing to pcrfuade
himfelf and others, that he could perloim
fpiue part of his magnificent promifei. Tne
real (lite of the cafe appears to be, that
while his army thought that the convention
had sent to arrest him, merely becau:e he
had been beaten, they relented it as an <11-
fnU offered to themselves, and were ready
to make a common cause with their gene
ral ; but when they discovered, by feuding
Brturnonville and the corumiffioners as pri
(o iers to the Aurtrians, that he was in con
cert with the common enemy, they resolv
ed to abandon him He had been three
times (hot at before he made his escape,
wis purfiied, 3nd probably care cd but a
Tt'*s ftaraU part of the two regiments oi
horse to MÂ«nÂ».
General Valence was at Antwerp on the
day the Congress met, not as a member of
it, nor as a prisoner, but having gone thi
ther during the suspension of hoftillties.
Our accounts do not state on w hat motive.
It was reported, and gained credit in the
city, that the unfortunate prisoners in the
temple had been murdered at Paris We
traced the report to two of the channels of
information through which it was (aid to
have come, and found it with refpeft tÂ«
them to be totally unfounded.
It was also raid that the convention had
ordered a million of men to be railed, and
I,2ooi'ieccs ofcannon to be call.
Pumourier refuelled leave to attero the
congress at Antwerp, not from any poeti
cal views, but merely that he might have
an opportunity of confuting so great an
authority as Lord Auckland on the subjeCt
of changing fides, he himfelf having been
troubled with scruples of conscience from
the moment that his army declared that
they would be true to theii oaths.
The mode of electing officers in the
French army which Duinourier in his let
ter, after the battle of the 18th of March,
pru'poled to suppress. has been the means
offavingthe northern army to the repub
lic. Had Dumourier had the appointment
of the officers everfmcehe took the com
mand, tlie army would have' gone with
him. By the mode of eleaion they are
worfefoldiers, but much better citizens.
General Dumourier has placed eighty
thmifaud pounds in the Englifli funds, for
what purpose time will discover.
One is tempted to admire the extraordi
nary address with which Dumourier firfl
lulled, and then triumphed over Jacobin
vigilance. It may be remembered, that
when he was minister, he was marked as a
suspicious charafler; nay, they difmifled
iiimfrom hiÂ« employments He then de
termined to lote his life in the service of
his country, and affeCted a fort of patriotic
desperation. When with the army, he took
care by some important services, firft to sig
nalize himfelf, and impute blame to others; j
at length he seized upon the polVof Gene
rJtiflivno, and was {tiled by the ruffians he
served, the favionr of his country. Now,
lie throws off the mask, and avows himfelf
the ariltocrat he was born.
When the commissioners of the conven
tion were brought before the prince de Co
bourg, Camus, speaking for the reft of his
companions in misfortune, said, J tjptre.
Manfieui\ JW dpw auvez pour nous les e

Some reports Hate, that general Bourne
nonville is treated more honorably by
prince Cobourg, than the other coinmif
lioners of the coniniifiion. We are in.
formed that the latter have betn sent pr>-
foiters to the cadle atAiitweip, and that
Bournonville is confined at Bruflels. ThiÂ»
circiniittancc, if true, give* a colour to the
report that Bournonville and Dumourier
had acted in concert, and accounts for the
compliments which the latter cunltantiy
paid him. particularly in his letter to the
convention on the 12th of March.
The Empress of Ruftia has sent persons
to all the towns through which the count
D'Artois was to pass, with inll ruÂ£tions t<>
pay his royal highness all the honours due
to his rank, and to declare to him the in
terett which her imperial majesty lakes in
the cause of theFrcnch p inces.
The game which Dumourier is now
playing may afford him fonie credit, but it
will be difficult to fay much in favour of a
man, who'e leniiments and principles of
morality arc guided only by the molt inex
hauflibie ambition.
The marefchal prince of Saxe Cobourg:,
in chief ol the armies of his ma
jelly the empt ror and of the empire,
TO THE FRENCH.
The general in chief Dumourier has
communicated to me his declaration to the
French nation. In it I find the fentimeutg
and principles of a virtuous man, who tru
ly loves his country, and who wishes to
put an end t-> the calamities and anarchy by
which it is desolated, by procuring for it
the happiness of a constitution antl a wife
and permanent government. I know this
also to be the unanimous wilh of all the
fovcreigns whom some factious persons
have armed againtt France, and particular
ly that of his lru.jctty the tmperor, and his
Pruflian majesty.
Filled at this moment with ertoem for
the bulk of so great and generous a nation,
to whom the immutable principles of ho
nour and justice were held sacred, until,
by the repetition of outrages, dil orders and
impottures,lhat part of it has been eflrsng
ed and corrupted, which, under the m lit
of humanity and of patriotism, speaks of
nothing but affaflinations and poignards.
Knowing also that this is the wife of all
virtuous people in France,
Profoundly penetrated with these great
truths, and defiling nothing but the prof
pet ity and glory of a country torn by so
manyconvulfionsand misfortunes,
J declare by the present pioclamation,
that I will support by all the force in my
power, the generous ard beneficent inten
tions of the gmeral in chief, DtimoiJnr
and his brave ai my.
I declare besides, that, having lately
fought us on several occasion as a valiant,
intrepid and generous enemy, 1 will join a
part of my troops, fliould general Dumou
rier dtlire it, or even all my army to that
of France, to co-operate as friends and
companions in arms worthy of reciprocal
ettcem, so as to reftoreto France her con
stitutional king, the conflitution she has
chosen, anfl, as a neeeflary consequence,
the means of perfecting it, if the nation
fliould fiv'l 11 imperfcit; thus to reflore to
France, as well as to the reft of f vrope,
peace, confidence, tranquility and happi
ness. 1 therefore declare on my word of
honour, that I will not enter the territory
of France to make conquetts, but firnply
and purely for the purposes ;.bove menti
oned.
I further declare upon my word of ho
nour, that should the military operations
require one or more fortrcfles to be given
up to my troops, 1 will keep them merely
as a sacred tmft ; and I engage, in the
most express and positive terms, to restore
them as soon as the government which (hull
be ettabllhed in France, or the brave gene
ral with whom I am about to make a com
mon cause, fliall demand such a lonctfiion.
1 also declare, that J will give the molt
ttrift orders, and will take the most.
rous and effectual measures, that my troops
(hall not commit the least difordcr ; not
allowing thefmallcft exa&ion or violence ;
and refpefting, every where on the terrij.

The PRINCE DE COBOURG..
Gen. DUMOURIER's LKTTFR
to the French Nation, dated Baths of St
Ama'id, Aprils, 1793.
SINCE the commencement of the revo
lution I have devoted myfelf to the main
ten tnce of the Liberty and Honor of thi
Nation
The services I renderedin theyear 1792
are the 1110 ft memorable. Miniller of so
reicn affairs during three months, I elevat
ed and fuffained the dignity of the Frencl
name chronghout all Europe. I was ca
lumiiiated by an odious cabal, by whom ]
was charged with having plundered so
jniliio'.js of livres deft in ed for secret fer
vices. I have proved, that of this fuin ]
did not expend half a million.
Hiving quitted the career of politics to
wards the dole of the month of June, 1
commanded a fmali army in the depart
ment of the North. This department ]
xvas ordered to quit withmy troops, at tlx
very time the Aultrians entered in forct
that part of the repub. ic. I disobeyed tht
order, saved the department, and an at
tempt was madeto come on me by surprize,
for the purpose of conveying me to the ci
tadel of Metz, where I was to be condemn
ed by a council of war to fuffer death.
On the2Bth of August, I took upon me.
in Champagne, the command of an arm)
of twenty thousand men, weak, and with
out either discipline oj" organization. 1
arrested tht- progress of eighty thousand
Pruflians and Heflians, and toned them tc
retreat, after they had facrificed the one
half of their army . I was then the favioui
of France ; and then it was that the moll
wicked of men, the opprobrium of French
menâin a word, Marat began to calum
niate me, without any mercy. With a part
of the victorious army of Champagne, and
some other troops, Lentered, 011 the jth oj
November, the Belgic Provinces,,where I
gained the forever.memorable battle ot
Jenappe ; and. after a fncceffion of advan
tages, entered Liege and Aix la-Chapelle,
towards the close of that month. From
that moment my deltrnftion was resolved
011 ; and I have been accused of nfpiring,
now, to the title of Duke of Brabant, now
to the Stadtholderfhip, and again to the
DiÂ£tarorfhip. To retard and crush my fuc
cefTes, the Minister Pache, supported by the
Criminal faftio.n to whom all our evils are
to be ascribed, fuffered the victorious army
to want every thing, and succeeded in dis
banding it by famine and nakedness. The
eonfequence was, that more than fifteen
thousand men were in the hospital, more
than twenty-five thousand deferred through
misery and difgult, ind upwards of ten
thousand horses died of hunger ! 1 1
I transmitted to the National Conven
tion very ltreniioU3 remonstrances, which
I followed up by repairing in person to
Parts, to engage the legislature to apply
& remedy to the evil : they did not even
condescend to read the four memorials I
delivered in. During thÂ« twenty-fix hours
I fp< ! t i-1 T"j>iis. I t emd (luring night
wands of pretended Federates demand ny
Head; and calumnies o every deli iption,
as well as uviinccs and intuit l -, foliowed me
ven i.jtu tlie country house to which I re
tired.
Having delivered in my resignation. 1
was retained in the ferviie ctfmy country
bec-nife it was proposed to me to negociate
ine fuipenhoi of the var agaiutl England
and Holland, which I had conceived as in
fpeiifiblc to the fact ty of the Netherlands.
W.nt't I nejjociated, and that luccefifully,
the national co.ivemioa itfelf battened (o
declare war, without making any pi epara
rations, and without either puutr 01
means for its support.
I was not even advised of this declara
tisn, and learned it through the medium of
the gazettes only. I battened to form a
fmali army of new troops, who had never
("tight; and wilh these troops, whom con
rirk nce rendered invincible, 1 made myfelf
ma'ter ot three strong places, and. was
eady to penetrate into the middle of Hol
land, when I learned the difalter of Aix-la-
Chaprllr, the railing of the liege of Mae
stri, tit, ana the fad retreat of the army.
Hy this army I was loudly summonedâl
abandoned* my conqueds to Hy to its fuc
c<mr ; and coufidered that we coukl be ex
tricated irom our difficulties by a speedy
luccefs only. I led my companions in.arms
to the enemy. On the 16th of March. I
hid a confide I';.ble advantage at Tiriemont.
On the 18th, 1 brought the enemy to a. ge
neral action; and tin centre and right
wing, untier my charge, were victorious.
The left winy, after having attacked, im
prudently Aid. Oâ < rhe 19th we retreated
honorably with the brave men thÂ« were
lelttogether ; fir a part of the army dis
banded itfelf. On the 2i(t and 221), we
fought with the fame courage ; and to our
firinm fs was owing the preservation of the
remains of an ai my which breathes folcly
so true liberty, for the reign of the laws,
and for the ext.nction of anarchy.
It was then that the Marats, the Rohe
fp;erres, and the criminal feÂ£t of Jacobins
ofPiris, plotted the fall of the generals,
and more especially ot mine. TbcCe vil
lains, bribed with the gold of foreign pow
er to complete the disorganization of the
armies, caused almott all the generals to be
' rrefted. Thev keep them in the jails of
Paris, to Septemb. rize them ; for thus it
is that thele monitors have coined a word,
to hand down to polterity the remembrance
of the horrid mafl'acres of the firit fix days
of Septs mher.
Whittt 1 was employed in re-composing
the army, in which employment I labourtd
night and day : 011 the ift of April (yefttr
day) four cwmmiflioners reached me with a
decree, purporting that I (hould be brought
to the bur of the conventioH itfelf. The
war mmi<ter Bournonville (my pupil) was
weak enough to accompany them, to suc
ceed me in my command. The perfom
who were in suite of these perfidious emit'-
faries, informed me themselves, that ditfe
rent groups of afl'affins, either fugitives
from or driven OHt of my army, were dif
perfed 011 the road to kill me before I could
reach Paris. 1 spent several hours in en
deavor ng to convince the coinmiflioners
of the imprudence of this arreltâNothing
could (hake their pride ; and I therefore
arretted the whole of them, to serve me as
hottagei against the crimes of Paris. I in-
Itantly arranged with the Imperialists a sus
pension of arms, and inarched towards the
capital, to extinguith as speedily as possi
ble the lighted embers of a civil war.
My dear countrymen ! it is expedient
that a true and brave man remove from
you the veil which covers ail our crimes
and mi -fortunes.âin 1 "S9, we made great
tffoits to obtain liberty, equality, and the
tbvereignty of the people.âOur principles
were consecrated in rhe declaration ot the
R gilts of Man ; and there have resulted
from the labours of our legislators, ift,
the declaration which fays, that France is
and [hall remain a monarchyâ2<lly, aenn
ilitution to which wefwoie feaity in 1789,
90. and 91. '
This oonflitution might, and indeed must
have been imperfect; but it ought and

.To the PRESIDENT of the
UNITED STATES.
SIR,
TN countries where the people have little
or no (hare in the government, (as in
Great Britain for inftancc) it is not un
common for the executive to aÂ£t in direst
oppofi-tion to the will of the nation. It is
to be hoped that the practice of apeing the
absurd and tyrannical fyttems of Britain,
though already carried to an alarming ex-
tent in this countfy, will never procced fa
iar, as to induce our cxetiiLive to try the
vain experiment of officially oppolinj; the
national will. An atceu.pt ot tins kind, at
present, would be ftcuiicd with defers eil
contempt, and bring rnin on its author ;
mill filth mu.t continue to be the cale, 1111-
ief's government lhal; be able to eliablilii so
liucli corrupt influence as, with ihe aid ot
-ayonet-logic, will be fnflicient to lnpport
t, in defiance of the people.
Had yon, Sir, be* ore you ventured to ifluc
a prociama ion which appear* co have given
much unealinels. confuited ths general fen
tinunts of your fellow-citizen-, you wou.d
nave lounil tkein, from one extremity oT
the Union to the other, firmly attached to
the cause ot France. \on would not have
found them disposed to conlider it as a
" duty" to forget theirdebt ot gratitude to
the French nation ; or to view with uncon
cern, the magnanimous efforts of a faithful
ally, to baffle the infernal proj;Â£ls of those
delpots w ho have confederate d for ihe pur
pofw of crufiling her infant liberty. Neither
would you have found them so tar divelled
of the feeli.gs of uien, as to treat with
" impartiality," and etjuul " friendfliip,"
thole tigÂ«sÂ» who so lately deluged our
country with'the blood of thousands, and
the men who generoutly flew to her rescue
and became her deliverers. No, Sirâhad
even no written treaty exilled between
France and the United States, stilt would
the ffrongert ties ot amity have united the
people of both nations j Hill would the re
publican citizens of America have regarded
frenchmen, contending for liberty, as their
brt ihren ; (till would they have sympathized
with them in tl.eir misfortunes', and have
exulted in their success. Such, unques
tionably, is the difpolition of the generality
of the people of the United States with re
fpeft to the French revolution. To fn-i.li
a people it wou.d have been a pleasing or
umffance. toil ivebeen able to discover in
the proclamation a recognition of the trea
ties with Frniice. That so little attention
has been p.iid to the clamours which have
arisen on this lilbjecf, in various parts of the
Union, is to be lamented by every friend
to the general government. Had you. Sir
confide led the importance of retaining
your popularity,you would, perhaps, nave
lutened to the murmurs of the citizens ;
and l\a>e deigned to give tfcem fucb expla
nations as might appear nectfl'iry to cleai
up the doubts which yet distract their minds
If this would have becnde/iindi/.g too far,
the fecretarv might have been author.zee
to fatisty the dou&ts or correct the mittake:
of the people.
It ought never to be forgotten by but
magistrates, that popular opinion is the
balis of our government ; and that whei:
any public measure w not well uiultrftood,
it would be by no means degrading to the
authors of that measure, how ever exalted
their Ration, to explain. Let me intreat
you, Sir, to deal candidly with the people ;
and, without loss of time, to remove their
anxiety, hy i iforming them whether it is
intended that the* treaties with France are
to be observed or not.
I an aware, Sir, that feme court-fitel
lites may have deceived you, with refpefl
to the sentiments of your fellow citizens.
The lirft magistrate of a country, whether
lie be called a king or a prefute.it. ft Id o*l
â¢<now s the real ftateofthe nation, particu
larly if lie be so much buoyed up by official
importance, as to think it beneath his dig
nity to mix occasionally with the people.
Let me caution you, Sir, to beware that
you do not view the slate of the pub Jit
mind, at this critical moment, through a
fallacious medium Let not the little
of the aristocratic few, and their contempt
ible minions, of speculators, tories, and
British einiffaries, be milfaken for the ex
ulted and general voice of the American
people. The spirit of 1776 it again roofed;
and (oonfliali themulhroom-lo; dlingsoftiie

volunteer toasts were afterwards given by"
citizen Genet, the governor of the State,,

" From tht tenor of some late accounts

me that if there is not more virtue in the

again take pi ice. Should a counter-revo
lution be etfe&ed, and a king set on the
throne, no doubt it will at firft be in the
character of limited monarchy, in order to
regain gradually from the people what
would not infantaneoufly follow from tilt
counter-revolution. I look upon limited
and despotic monarchy, with aristocratic

his degeneracy to such a length.
This process again ft two sailors, who
have become French citizens by entering
into the service of Franee, by the executive
authority of the United States, is a fubjefl
of too much magnitude to pass by unno

June 3, 1793-
Through your paper, Mr. Freneati, I
beg leave to aikâilk. Are the poilsw hich
the Britilh lie-id within the territory of the
United States, at the cond ulion of the late
unnatural and bloody war, given up agree
jbly to treaty ? 2d. If not, what is the
reason ? 3d. Has any demand thereoi
ever been made ? 4th. Whose duty is it.
whether of the Legitlative or the Execu
tive of the Union, to demand the ctfiicm of
thole posts? sth. Is it the interest of the
United States tnat they be given up? If so.
I alk, is it not highly criminal in that in
dividual, or body, whose duty it Â»a to in
iilk 011 a compliance with the treaty, to
have deferred it to this time ?
The public are entitled to fatisfactory
answers. They will not be bamboozled.
This is not a lit foil for chicane or cov.rt
intrigue.
Of all the adronomers, Mr. Herfchrll
has been most fuccefÂ»ful in bringing us to
an intimate acquaintance with our atten
dant planet, the Moon. He has totally
exploded the old opinion of there being no
atiiiofphere around her, h topfequently no
air, by his difcoverv of three bmrningroown-
tains, or volcanoes,on different p*rts of the
Moon's iurface, which could not exiit
without air. indeed, lam convinced that
an atmofpere more or less dense, is an in
separable appendage to all the opakebodies
of the nniverfe. Some of his mod recent
discoveries are mentioned in a late Daily
Paper, As to the large edifice, of the size
of St. Paul's, the less that is said about
it the better. I lufpett that it is rather
loine promontory, or broken cliff of im
inenfefize, which Mr. Herfchell has mis
taken for a building. Unfortunately tor
the curious, it is the grand imperfeÂ£lion of
the telescope, that in proportion as it mag
nifies, it darkens. Hence the improbabi
lity that the inhabitants of the moon will
ever be difcoverabk; by means of glasses.
It has a long time been my opinion, that
the luminous portions of the moon's fur
face are seas, and the dark parts land;
and, to the lunarians, the seas and lands of
this earth, no doubt, exhibit an appear
ance greatly iimilitr. A man Handing on a
hill in a dear day, In view of the ocean,
ivill at once observe by carting his eye on
:he two elements of earth and water, that
:he latter rtflectJ the light much more
Irongly than the former, and fumething in
:he manner of a polished mirrour.âlf the
moon isno other than an atterdant, or fer
yant, of the earth ; if we are the parlour
Si she the kitchen,as all astro lomers agree.
I do not much regret the imperfeilion of
:elefcopes in not affording a more exact
knowledge of her interna! ceconomy. If
his earth, which is thirteen times larger.
*nd superior in every refpeft, exhibits fucli
wretched scenes of blood, misery, and de
flation, as we daily fee or hear of, the
moon, being no other than her kitchen, it
jy fair inference a world of w.ir and ven
geance, without the !â  all interval of paci
'ication, & the meni is that inhabit her are
indoubtedly a set of blackguards.
Lately died, (or more properly was kil
ed) at his feat in Anfon county. Nor:h Ca

caking the nodding of the red cap for a

in attack on his honour, that he threw liinx

PHILADELPHIA,
June 5.
" THE writers opposed to the French,
are fond of setting up a man of Jiraw, jufl
to have the fatisfaftion of beating bin:
down. They exclaim aganft involving
curfelves in the present quarrels of Eu
rope. No man has ever appeared to urgs
this } no American wifhesto be concerned
in the contest ; but the only question is.
whether <we are obligated to comply with tin
terms oj a sacred treaty ? The honor and
pledged faith of the States were violently
contended for, in discharging our public
debt, and the fund-ng fyflem was eflablifh
ed on these principles. But our engage
ments bv a solemn treaty, (which are the
great basis of national honor and security)
are held up by these writers, as a fubjedt ol
a trifling nature ; as not worthy our atten
tion, and ou ( ,ht to be set aside by fophijlry.
or any other artifice we can devise. Out
treaty, fay they, is with " His Chrijliat
Majejly," but now the government is
changed, we are not bound to comply with
it- How would this reasoning have suited
these persons as it related to the public
debt. It might have been allied, whether
our engagements were with the army ; and
lince they had alienated their property,
and fold their notes at 2/6 in the pound,
whether we were bound to discharge them
at 20/"? Such an interrogatory, would
hsve been anathematized, as it refpe&ed
the funding system j anjl if it had prevail
ed, thousands who are now wrapt up in
their paper certificates, and bank scripts,
would have remained in their original state
of obfeurity.
All writers on governmeut, hold up the
facrednefs of treatiesâthat they are to bi.
faithfully observed. Those writers there
fore, that are for breaking our treaty with
France, and for giving equal terms to Eng.
land, do not understand the ties which bind
nations, who have by treaty become allies.
England has no claim upon us, but France
has ; if we should at this moment prove
perfidious to the latter, we may place our
selves in a very disagreeable filiation
Should we hesitate to eomply with our
treaty, France may so far resent it, as to
declare war against us. In this cafe, what
would become of our trade ? The whole
commerce we now carry on to any advan
tage ,is with the French : The Engli/h have
ever shewn a determfnation to injure us in
every part of our trade : France, on the
contrary, has opened her ports both in
Europe and the Wejl-Indies. The English
embarrass us in ail our connexions with
them, while the French art: pursuing the
mod liberal measures to facilitate our com
mercial negotiations. Our importations
from England, confiding of gew-gaws, to
pamper our follies, are dedru&ive to the
interellof this country: It' atradethat will
finally ruin U3, and in time render the
greatest part of those who are concerned
in it vaflals to a set of Britiih rc/idents who
reside among us, merely to overjee the con
dud of their customers, and to receive
their money as fad as they colledt it in
th :ir stores and ftiops.
Upon the whole, our duty is to rdhere
to our treaty, and to give it a fair, candid
condruÂ£tion ; not attempt to nullify it by
!rifling fubtcr?~ug-es, or pettyfogging sophis
try. We wish to live in peace with all na
tions, and the moil effectual method to se
cure our tranquility, is to ast ftriftly on
the principles of national honor No civil
ized nr.tion can dejtre us to break the so
lemn obligation of a treaty, neither is it
i xpedted that France will require any thing
unr afonab/e to draw us into the p.efent
war. The generosity of that nation, it is
probable, will permit lis to continue in
drift neutrality, and we have move to hope
from theirfriendly difpofuion, than from tlie
fnphi/lry and aiufe of writers who are w,fil
ing to explain away the obligations of our
treaty." llrid. Chron ]

of initruÂ£tions from the executive of the
