Of the National Convention to the
French People.
26thjune, 1793, 2d I(car of the Republic-
Citizens,
YOUR. Representatives, faithful to their
dary and to their engagements, have
completed the Co.iftitutioi, and are about
to convoke the primary alFeinblies. ihi
in their answer to the enemies ot equality
and liberty.
The National Convention having dif
cbarged the firft, the molt urgent, andmoft
sacred of its duties, will in a few days lay
before tile nation thecaufes ot the divillous
which have agitated the Republic at large;
causes which have so long withheld from
the order of the day the moll important
objects of deliberation, and, by reviving
civil discord, infjaired foreign powers with
the hopes of making conqUeits agiinlt a
Republic torn by faÂ£tions.
But whi Ift a legal convocation is rtbout
to re-unite you into primary aii'emblies, in
order to lay the eternal balls of liberty and
equality, the foundations of a republican
government ; those who have conftautly
betrayed their country, are now giving the
lignal of civil war i:i all parts of the Re
public.
War maintained by fanatacifm not mak
ing aprogrefsl'ufliciently rapid, they give a
new colour to the infurreftions which they
excite ; they midead by the idolatry of
persons and reputation, and the delulion
of political opinions, those whom religious
fanatacifm corld not seduce.
Could they carry their defigus into exe
cution, France woidd soon be given up to
greater horrors than Poland experienced,
which underwent the yoke of three tyrants,
â without having drawn h fwnrd. She
would destroy herfelf in * ie p'refence of
tl * combined powers and of their armies
alfcmbt'ed on our frontiers : instead ot a
fertile country and flourifhing cities, (lie
would present only the horrid fpeftacle of
fields of carnage and heaps of allies.
Citizens, the traitors who did their ut
most to midead you and to hurry you away
into their revolt, propose to you to march
against Paris and the National Convention.
Can Paris be an object 6f hostility to the
Republic? Is It not the alylutn of your
brothers and the cradle of liberty ? Like
you, the citizens of Paris wished for the
constitution ; they have denounced the au
thors of the evils with which France is
opprefled.
When on the 20th of June last year, Pa
ris proclaimed the dangers of the country
and the conspiracy of the last of its king*,
some admini(\rators, traitors to their
country, usurping the sovereign powers,
offered to reinforce the guard of the con
spirator, and to fend numerous battalibns
against Pari-;. France was soon undeceiv
ed. The federates of the 83 departments,
when arrived at Paris, found none but
brothers there, and (hared with them the
dangers aud the glory of overturning the
throne.
In like manner, when France fliali be
fully acquainted with the causes and events
which neceditated the denunciation of the
3tit of May and the decree of arrest paflcd
on the 2d of June, against 32 members of
the National Convention, (lie will approve
the wisdom and the happy result of these
measures.
Can the difTohition of the Convention be
the object of your with? Is it proposed
to you to abolifii it ?
What government would then remain to
you? Whither would you rally ? What
would become of eleven armies aflembied
on the frontiers and on the coalts ? Can
the action of government be suspended for
a (ingle day ? Should the departments dis
own the Convention, the Republic would
be without a government, without a cen
tral adininiftration; the armies would
tlifperfe ; foreign powers would invade
our territory: Frenchmen would turn their
arms against themselves, and the Republic
would be annihilated.
Citizens, your most dangerous enemies
are those who precipitate you into civil
war.
Those magistrates wham you had chosen
to maintain the police and to discharge the
municipal functions, those administrators
whom you had elected to execute the laws
and to be the agents of government, have
seized upon the government itfelf, and
have grasped at the national sovereignty.
Your rights, your interests have been a
bandoned and facrificed. In many of the
adininiftrative aflemblies your fsrvice his
bÂ»?n wholly negleÂ£ted,whilft the only object:
of concern were deputations, plots, coaliti
ons, i& projeitsof war againli the Republic.
Those functionaries did not luok on as
thei.' brothers arid fellow citizens, five
hundred thousand Frenchmen who have de
voted thenil'elves to the defence of liberty
against tyrants. Dy intercepting the ar
tillery, amu>uniiiou and provilions, they
expcifed them t ) perish to no purppfe, and
without cementing with their blood the
foundations of the Republic.
Geieroin warriors whom so many trea
sons have not artonilhed, you Have con
ltantly rallied to the fttnd. rd of the Re
public and to the tree of liberty.
You have surmounted by your courage,
the oi.ftacks which La Fayette and Du
monrier had oppofcd to your success. A
new conlpiracy drtefled, is the last crisis
through which you were to pass, in order
to conquer and eflabliili liberty.
You alio expected a confutation which
your arms will make Europe respect; the
lability of a free and acknowledged go
.'ernm;nc will etifure you success ; the
;onllitution will powerfully support your
irms, and will conduct you, through vic
:ory, to peace.
In the midrtofher agitations and difor
lers, France counts but a fniall .number of
onfpiracors. The mass of citizens, al
ways pure, inspired by sentiment, eulight
:ned by eternal reason, has preserved it
elf from fed action and error.
Thole adminiftrStive bbdies, whomtrai
ors had lljrrcd up against the Republic,
â ecollect at lull, that they have a country,
ind that they can have nolle othex than
:he Republic.
The National Convention has received
'rom several departments, recantations
.vhich will prove to potterity, that the vir
:u oust man in ay be milled, b net hat be opens
lis eyes to the light before his error be
:onies hurtful tofociety and humanity.
The examples, whiift they warn us to re
irefs confulionat its firit appearance, and
to be severe towards the factious and the
.onfpirator, make it the duty of a humane
egiflator to receive with indulgence the
deluded fellow citizen, and to ofter only
nlfruition to those who have always been
lttached to their country, and who want
jnly to be informed in order to relume
heir rank among good citizcns.
Citizens who have sworn to befree, whe
ivifhto have a country, aconltitution, rallj
:o the National Convention, who pledge
tfelf to preserve the Republic one and in
livilible.
EXTRACT from the New-Brunswick
Advertiser: being part of an Ad
dress on a very inter eftiugfubjeit.
1J" ET me now be indulged in speaking :
â *-' few words on theprolpeÂ£l there seem:
:o arise of a' war between Great-Britair
ind the United States, which fee is to bÂ«
:he delign ot the Prelident's proclamatior
to avert. It appears to me and I presume
:o every thinking man in the United States,
âºhat we have had and (till have an indirect
war with that reltlefs-and deligning nation,
nearly lince the ligning the late peaceâ
through their unjult detention of the wefi
-rn pollsâwhich it was prefu:iied at thai
treaty they really meant to give up in the
courte ot a year or twoâtaking a reason
able time lor their Indian traders to call in
their property fronrthe didant regions. Il
is true that that part of the treaty is loofly
worded, and not so explicit as a bargain
school-boys would have made in the tranf
fer ot a top, a ball, or a marbleâyet I
think the honelt un(nfpeÂ£ling hearts of out
commifioners thought the tfritons as ho
nest as themlelves, and that they would
luon give lip those ports according to the
true intent and meaning of the treaty, and
I can by no means impute their condufr, as
has been surmised, to Britilh gold dull
blinding the eyes of their underflanding in
the ligning that article.
From this cause, without a doubt arising
in the mind of any sensible man I have con
versed with on this fubjett, springs the war
with the Indians, for it is well known that
at those polts they are supplied not only
with arms and ammunition, but with every
article they Hand in need of for their ra
vage depredations, in which the United
States have fjtfered the loss of thousands
of men, women and children, betides the
expenditure of at lead five millions of dol
lars, and in this present year, I doubt whe
ther the account will be closed under two
millons, and perhaps the lives of many of
our worthy/ellow which'money
(hould hive been applied ,to pay our just
debts: add to this, their late and present
depredations on the ocean, perhaps not
less than 150 of our veflels, taken by then),
from our honest merchants, and unjultly
detained, to the ruin of their families, and
our unarmed Teamen treated in an inhu
man manner. Now if we are to bear all
this without a profpeft of redrtjfs, dud our
hands to be tied up, let us strike out from
our new made calendar the Day that ha:
bees kept in remembrance of our birth as
a nation, and turn to lick the dust that des
pots are preparing for us. If the Britons
with to be at peace with the United States,
let them come forward and ftiew an exam
ple of justice and humanity, by immediate
ly giving up Niagara, Detroit, and all the
extent of country they ceded to us by the
la;e treaty of peace ; but so long as they
hold thole polls, they certainly war in 2
daltardly manner against us. And Jet 0111
government also cofne forward and fliew
an example of justice to the natives, ant
[his terrible and expensive war will fooi
:ea!'e. It is true that wc as private citi
zens cannot judge fully of these matters,
lot knowing the secret springs of govern
ment, but so far as they have come to 0111
cnowledge, we as free citizens have a righi
:o judge for ourfeives, and may and ough;
:o remonffrate to Congress whenever ihey
ire in feffton, which I trust will be verj
"0011. There seems indeed a general dreac;
if war Tept, I know not how, among ns
[ wouh here ajli, have the Americans 101 l
heir v: rue? Are they callous to insult:
Vom a bankrupt nation? In my humble
spin',o:i we never had nor perhaps nevei
ivill have a time,for humbling the Englilh(il
Mongrels thinks it proper to take time bj
:he for.Jock to do their country ample ju-
Irice) liice the present time; but if it car
be don "iy proper negociations, and the Ig
nited ates'at the fame time fulfil witl
honour .uoir treaty with the French nati-
Dn, our allies/in the name of humanity, ft
be it.
Upon the whole, I beg to be indulged ir
moving this very respectable audience, thai
i resolve may be made that a dutiful peti
tion be prepared and] sent to the Fathei
t>f our country, intreating him to iflue hi:
request to both branches of the federal go
rernment to meet sooner than their latt
*djonniment was fettled at, as we conceiv<
the critical situation of our country call
for the immediate best counfelsof our wif
:it citizens at this present time.
And also that a Resolve be imriiediatelj
made by us, that we enter into the spirit o
liis proclamation, so far as to allure hin
that we wili not direOly or indireÂ£tiy fii
out any veflels for the purpose of war, awe
that so far as our power can be lawful!)
exerted, we will dii'courage any overt
that may be attempted among us, uuti
Congress thinks it proper to uuloofe oui
hands."

Governtr HANCOCK'S Speceh to tin
Legijlature of M.iJfjchufctts, at the open
ing of their SeJJioni on the 18M of Sep
tember inflant,
Mr.Prefidei't.-diid Gentlemen oftheSenate
Mr.Speaker,and Gentlemen of the Houff
of Representatives,
""PHE Proclamation by which the Gene
ral Court is convened, contains Â£
copy of a civil precept. The service o;
which on me, andonthe attorney-general
was the principal reason of my exercifinj
this part of that authority devolved on nit
by the constitution.
The suit commenced by W1 Lf.rAM VAs
sAL,if the commonwealth is held to an
swer thereon, mull be decided on principle:
very interesting to its welfare as a slate.
I cannot conceive that the people of thi:
commonwealth, when they, by their Re
presentatives in Convention, adopted the
Conflitution of a General Government
expected that each slate fliould be held lia
ble to answer 011 compulsory civilprocefs
to every individual resident in anothei
state, or in a foreign kingdom. Three
Judges of the United States of America,
having solemnly given it as their opinion,
that the several liates are thus liable, the
question then [us become highly important
to the people.
I did not find myfelf authorized in virtue
of my office as governor ol the common
wealth, to appear, either by myfelf or by
uiy substitute, in any court of jultice, eithei
to deny the authority of the court over this
government, or to lubmit to its jurifdic
cion in a point, which I cannot, at present,
consider as fettled. Nor did I conceivt
that any other perfoi) touid have that ay
[Total Numb. 200.]
thor -y, without afpecial appointment by
the Jegiflature for that purpose.
J he service of this process being laid
before the Council, they advised me to
call the two Koufesinto feflion. My opi
nion accorded with their advice, for seve
ral reasons ; some of which are too ob
vious to need repeatingâothers I will fug -
geft Lo you.
Uie demand of William VafTal, if I am
not mistaken, in his design and in the ten
dency of the process, will involve and con
clude a question of legality, on the mode
of confifcating the persona! estate of that
class of people, who, in our laws, are de
nominated Absentees. It is therefore
neceflary, that effectual meaftires lliould be
peedily adopted, to prevent a determina
tion, which may so greatly injure the in
terell, and so di'fagreeably affect the feel
ings of the citizens of this commonwealth.
Should you, gentlemen, he of opinion*
lhat by the constitution of the United
Stares, the Commonwealth may becem
pelled to answer on this process, you will,
make such provision for defending again ft
the itiit, as shall appear to you to be pro
per and expedient.
Should you coniider the commonwealth
not to be thus liable, your deliberations
will beftich, as will tend to procure to the
-onftitution, under which this authority is
:lairrled, a more favourable and a more
unexceptionable confttuftion. But it may
lappen that your investigation may lead
(â ou to conclude, that the conftru&i
diis given to the judiciary power of the
United States, by three ot the judges, is
-ight, according to the letter of the coufti
:ution, and yet, that it will tend to the
promotion of peace and harmofjy in the Li
lian, and to the preservation of our fede
-al government, so happily ellablifhed, to
procure such alterations iu the judiciary
irticlei, as may fecurejhe States fev-eraliy,
n the enjoyment of that (hare oHVf
y, which it was intended they should re
;ain poifefs. In this last cafe you will
iireit your measures to that point.
From these considerations, I confiderecl
t as absolutely neceFary, that you should
ie in feflion at an earlier day than that to
â vhlch the general court flood adjourned,
i'our deliberations 011 this fubjeft will take
ome time, and though Congress will meec
jn the iirfl: monday in December, yet their
effion may be fliort. You could not,
therefore, after the last Wednesday inja
luary, have tini# to do what Â«-i!l be necef
ary. The court too, where this suit is
lending, will be in ieflion early in Fe
bruary, and the result of the business will
pe then expefied.
I avoid giving an opinion either on the.
question, vvhether the commonwealth is
liable to be sued, or whether if it is so cir
cumltanced, an attempt to procure an al
teration, is eligible. Yet I consider it to
oe of the last importance to the hap
piness and interest of the United States, as
well in their united, as in their separate
:apacity, to have this point, properly, fatif
tartorily and finally fettled. It is true that
llates, kingdoms, and empires ought to do
justice ; but it is as true, that there are cer
tain inherent principles in the conftitutioii.
of each, which can never be surrendered
without eiientially changing the nature'
or destroying the existence of the novernl
ment.
I believe that the commonwealth of
Maflachufetts, from the generosity and
good feelings of its citizens, will be always
ready, as iar as the people's abilitv fhaJL
idiilit of, to do justice to all men. Yet ia
order to preserve the peace and fafety of
the Union,, and to establish in the bofonis
of other nations, a confidence in the refli
tiide of this, it is very proper that there
(hould be a tribunal of justice, independent
of the particular states, which may be re-
Ported to in certain cases. This was in
tended to be provided for by the federal
constitution : but whether the present cafe
is properly before that tribunal,
to that constitution, or whether the procefi?
under confederation, is within the intend-;
ment of that provision, you will consider.
Whether the provision in the Federal
conilitution for the extension of the judicb;.
ary power to states, is intended to be er - .
ercifed in matters of civil contract, or in d .
ther matters which took place before thic
government was formed ; or whether it i
intended only to give a remedy for fu.-Jfi
injuries as may take place by force, ariiy
may therefore have a tendency to destroy
the peace of the Union, or involve the na
tion in a war with foreign powers, is of
consequence enough to demand a confide'-
ration. Jf fbe judiciary power of the UnitÂ«n is'to exercised on questions of civil con
nects made by a State, the decilion mult be
had, either oil the laws ot'ihe state against
which the demand is made, or on those of
the ltate or kingdom to vvtlich the demand
ant belongs, or on the laws of the United
States: the absurdity of the two firlt need
not to be pointed out, but the other would
render the legifiative authority of Congress
over the particular ft ates, as mere corpo
rations commensurate to the claim of theju
diciary power. Wherethe demand shall be
for a recompenfeof damages reflilting'rom
an injury; there the law of nations, the Con
ftitulion of the United States, and exilt
ing treaties, will govern the decilion. And
even in that cale, it will be a question,
whether it should be intended that each
state is liable to be drawn to the (eet of
the federal government, and there tried
by a jury of the vicinage, ill the fame man
ner as a corporation would be treated.
Consrefs, no doubt, (hould you inflruÂ£t
yourfenators on the fnbjeft, will take'time
to consider these questions, in proportion
to the important light they may appear in.
The Legislature of the Union, has never
yet contemplated this subject : For in the
eftablifhmen: of the judiciary fytfem it is
entirely neglected : No mention is made
in the aits of Congress of the fu ability of a
liate. Nor is there any process against a
state, provided for in the laws of the Uni
ted States.
Gentlemen of the Senate, and
Gentlemenof the House ofÃeprefentatives,
When the government of the United
States was proposed to the people's consi
deration, I then was, and yet am, deeply
imprelfed with the necefiity 'â¢ of a more
perfect wtion eft/te jlates," than at that time
existed, and, therefore, exerted the share
of influence whish I polfeffed, in favour of
its being adopted. I then considered it as
being by no pjeans explicit in the descrip
tion of the powers intended t# be delega
ted; but trusted, that the wisdom of the
people would very soon render every part
ef it definite and certain. The idea, that
it isdangerous to examine'fyffems of go
vernment, and to compare the elfeÂ£ls pro
duced fev their adminiflration, with the
principles on which they were raised, is in
admiflibie among a free peopfe. If the
people are capable of prattiting oil a free
government, they are able, without difor
-ders or convuifions, to examine, alter, and
amend the fyfteins which they have or
dained. â And it is of great confequencc to
ttie freedom of a nation to review its civil
constitution, and to compare the practice
under it, vritji the principles upon which it
depends. The tendency of every meaftire,
and the effect of evesy precedent, ought to
â be fcrupuloully attended to, and critically
examined.âThis is the bulinefsof the re
presentatives of the people, and can never
be by them confided to any other persons.
The great objeÂ£l presented to us by oOr
political situation, is the support of the
general government, the giving force and
efficacy to its functions, without destrOying
the powerÂ», which the people intended to
vest and to rcferve in-tlie state governments.
A consolidation of all the states into one
government, would at once endanger the
nation as a republic, and eventually divide
the states united, or eradicate the princi
ples whicn we have contended for.
It is much less hazardous to prevertt the
establishment of a dangerous precedent,
than to attempt an abolition of it, after it
has obtained a ptace in a civil institution.
Your fellow citizens wait this
event of your deliberations on the impor
tant bulinefs before you : And 1, as one of
them,reft fatisfied, thatthe result will be
such, as will eltablilh the rights of the
commonwealth, and give support and ef
ficacy to the general government. In this
â view, and in every other, in which the
peace, liberty and fafety of our fellow ci
tizens, not only of this state, but of the
United States, are concerned, reft assured,
gentlemen, that no effsrt nor zeal on my
part shall be wanting. I lhall, therefore,
only add, I will do every tiling inmy pow
er to expedite the business of the feifion,
and to render it as little expensive to our
â¢conflituents, as exigencies will admit.

Natitz; Ju\y r. " On the 29th lilt, we
received intelligence from every quarter,
that we were to be attacked at night'â
Some expected this event with fond impa
tience ; others with fear", and all with ter
ror. On the 3Â°th, at two in the morning,
we were awakened by the report of a can
non, which was soon followed by the firing
of more. The royalilts were then attack
ing the bridge of RonfTeau over the Seine,
â op the other fide of the Loire, and carried
it; but this was only a falfe attack.
"At break of day, all the polts on the
other fide of the Loire were attacked by
'different corps, one of which came by the
road of Angers, another by that of Rennes,
and a third by the way of Anrres. At all
these points, the defence was as vigorous
a> the attack. The patriots had 18 pound
ers ; but the royalists had only 12 pounders.
" The contest lasted with unabated fury
till fix at night, when the ardour of the as
failants began to flicken. At ten o'clock
they retreated in good order to Oudon, a
very strong poll between Mauves and An
cenis, tour leagues from Nantz. Some
fay, that the/ have evacuatedAncertis,others
alien, that they are preparing to return to
the charge with a superior force.âAt, yet,
however, they have not renewed their at
tack.
" The patriots had 600 killed, and about
1500 wounded ; all the hospitals and con
vents are crammed with them, and there
scarce exists one family in 0111- town, but
has to lament the loss of a relation or
friend. As the royalists had made them
selves masters of the suburbs, the musket
balls fhouipred down upon the patriots
from every house, without their being able
to discover from whence they were iired
upon theiH The loss of the royalists is not
known, but it is not very considerable, be
-caufe they were covered by houses and
walls, and they every where appeared only
in final! numbers to direfl their artillery,
which was exceedingly well served.
" It is rather astonishing that the royal
ifts, having at their disposal a numerous
army, (hould have attacked so important
a town with a corps confiding of only 8000
men ; that they (liould have confined them
selves for 16 hours to a cannonade, inflead
of attacking the garrison with spirit and vi
gour, and that they did not avail themselves
of a moment, when the troops of tlie line
g3ve\vay, to rush upon them with fixed ba
yonets, and thus to decide the day in their
own favour.
" The poll nearthe bridge of RonlTeau
from which Gen. Beyflier in the morning
of the 30th had been dislodged, was eva
cuated again by the royalists on the follow
ing night. Fear, left the rdyalifts 'might
reap the fume advantages in another attack
from the suburbs, as they did on the 30th,
has caused the patriots to set fire to a great
number of houses, and to btirn them to the
gron nd.
" There are vefTels, without mads, which
were placed in the midst of the river, op
posite the bleaching place, ami were filled
with jorifoners fufpefted of royalifm, but
not convicted of any crime."
Genoa, July 2. The captain of a (hip just
arrived here from Ponente, brings intelli
gence, that, yesterday morning, he heard
a violent and lading cannonade, proceed
ing, by the wind, from the environs of
Nice, which leaves us to conclude that that
place is bombarded by the Spanish fleet.
London, July 25. We have just received
intelligenceX)f the Trench royalists having
again attacked Nantz ; ahd that tbe la ft
news from thence, was, that they were fir
ing red hot balls into the town, which it
was thought would fnrrender. The cap
ture of this place is more important at this
jundtwre. as we have season to believe that
it would greatly facilitate the operations
Df Lotd Howe, which it is generally sup
posed are directed to that quarter. Â«
IVarfaw, June 20- The king has deliver
ed in his written anftver to the Ruffian and
Prufliau minilters relative to the intended
partition of the republic of Poland. It is
in substance as follows : 41 I declared, that
I acceded to the general confederation of
Targovitz, under the anfpices of her im
perial majesty the emprefe of all the Rufiaas,
in consequence of the promise that the pof
fefiionsTaf the republic Ihould not be leflen
ed.
This was the sole motive that directed
Thy-cftnduct.
" My duty requires, that I (hould inform
the States afTembled in their Diet j that I
hope they preserve the fame sentiments as
myfelf in respect to the integrity of the
country.
'â¢ I think that we ought to make a pru
dent and well refle&ed answer to the two
notes received from the allied court?, and
that all our demands ihould be confined to
a reditution of our territories.
" I flatter myfelf, that the wisdom and
equity of their imperial and royal majeflies
will allow that our nation has not in any
manner given occasion to the partition
which these two courts have judged proper
to make."
Bonrdeaux, July 6. " The privateer La
Citoyenne Francaife, of this port, Captain
Dubedat, mounting 26 carriage guns, 8 and
12 pounders, and 6fwivels, returned hither
yesterday, after a glorious engagement
which (he supported from 6 till half past
8 in the evening, against an Englilh frigate
of 40 guns, in lit. 42. 24. N. and long 15.
W. from the meridian of Paris. Captain
Dubedat was killed in the engagement by
a bullet which struck him in the bread.
Citizen Rigal. the second Captain, then
took the command, but the English frigate
being disabled in her bowsprit aud mizen
inaft dropt astern. La Citoyenne Francaife
pursued her ; but the captain finding it ne
cefl'ary to repair his running rigging, which
was all cut to pieces, and to fifh his lower
masts. which heobferved were in danger
of falling overboard, he loft fight of the
enemy in the night time, without being
able to discover her the next morning, a>
he was not in a condition to croud faTl in
order to Iceep up with her. La Citoyenne
Francaife had 16 men killed, and 37 wound

as our fufferingthe infection to be intro

their cry ; when, in reality, "there isn<.
peace." The Britilh will not allow us tc
be neutral at sea ; the benefits of the car
rying trade of this country are too impor
tant an object for them, to futfer us to en
joy it in quiet. In alliance with the Spa

ing ground, that a bargain has been made
between the Spaniards and Britilh. to pre
vent the United States forever from ex
tending their territory beyond the Ohio anc
the Miffifippi. For thiÂ« purpose theconfede
rate Indians have been advijed, at and be
fore the late treaty, to infitt upon the Ohic
as the boundary, and even as far eaftware
as the Alleghany. I lately received alet

and information ; who affiires Big that no
thing is more dreaded through Europe,
than the complete and final eftablifhmeni
of republican government in America, or,
at present, an offenfive alliance withFranfce.
The defpnts apprehend, that it will even
tually detlroy the royal, (alias, tyrannical]
domination intended to be perpetuated
through Europe, in its titmofi severity,
provided the exertions of France fail ; and
therefore r.o effort will be wanting on

vefl'els of war, having fuccefsfully engaged
in those seas the veflels belonging to ty

to take under their protection all American
veflels bound to France, they (hould fall in

to give them every succour in their power,
and to convoy them to the ports above

Americans may hope that the destination

the British despot, who in attempting tÂ»
impose his regulations upon their com

MORAL REFLECTION:
[From a Connecticut Paper."]
' Nought can persuade our feet to run
The pure and pieus race ;
3ur steps the ways of wisdom fliun,
We turn our heels to grace.
To mount heaven's Hill we fliould hare
lilc'd,
But steed would not ascend,
The niof-e we fpurr'd, the more file kick'd 0
And oft rear'd up behind.
>0 lately in Miami's fields
Old St. Clair's war-worn horse
Could not, by two well worked heeli
Be prick'd from wonted course.
So wonder neither, for 'tis said,
(Whether 'tis true or not)
He took one /pur within his head,
The other he forgot!"
Rather illiberal: but, we tnufl " allow the.
"Pumpkins to sing a tittle,now is then in com
â¢Hon metre."]

WHILE little lads their books forfake,
Or sigh to meet the hour of play,
You, Lycidas, no leisure take.
But (till thro' learned pages drayâ
With years so few, ah wiiy so grave,
Why every hour to books a (lave i
Hence, Lycidas, I pray, retire:
Go with your mates and take your play,
Not him I prize, or much admire
Who, curious, hangs on all I fay ;
*1 he lad that's wife before his time
Will be a coxcomb in his prime.
Slay not too close in wisdom's fliopâ:
Till time a rip;r mind prepares
The hall, the marble, and the top
Are books that (hould divide your
cares; â
The boys that life's gay morn enjoy,
I love to fee them ait the boy.
] hate the pert, I hate the tjold,
Who proud of years, but half a (core,
With none, but men, would converse hold
And things beyond their reach explore ;
Like the fam'd Cretan, soaring high
To melt their waxen wingsâand die !

DIALOGUE between a Citizen of Phila
delphia, and a Jersey Farmer (ten mites
from town.)
Farmer. Ho !âwho &re you, you yel
low-fever-looking-fellow ; and what buii-
Defa have you ont of your city i
Citizen. Sir, I do afiure you, upon my
word of honour, that there is not a foun
der man in New-Jersey than myfelf. I eat
my three meals a d -v, have not even had
a linger ach these iix months, and can
take an oath upon the holy evangelists,
that the dodtors have not had a nine-pence
from ate these seven years. Feel my pulse,
and convince yourfeif.
Farmer. Feel your pulse, Sir !âmay I
die by the grip of an anodyne necklace, if
I would come within ten yards of you for
ten pounds. Why, fir, your breath ij
pestilenceâyour face is the very image
of d^ftruftionâyour eyes are death's poop
laothornsâyou are a moving mass of pu
tridity, corruption, plague, poison, and
putrefa&ion âYour pulse !ânot I, faith
ânor do I believe you have any more
pulse than a man that was laid in his grave
thirty years ago. \Â¥iie citizen advance!
towards him.\ Avail! avail, fir 1 advance
not, I befeecb you, if you have any regard
to your foul's healthâkeep to leeward,
or, by the three prongs of my dung fork,
I will make ghost's meat of you ! âI will
inltantly finilh what the yellow fever has
begun 1
Citizen. The fun draws low ! a night's
lodging in your barn, or even in your
horse (table, would claim my eternal gra
titude. I feel weary with my long walk,
a nap of deep would be refrefhing, and
by peep of day I will be jogging.
Farmer. Your weariness, or rather
weakness, arises ftmply from the raging
fever that now burns like a fiery furnace
within you,âSleep in my barn !âvery
pretty indeed! â why, my very horses
would catch the yellow fever from you.
In such a horrid date of contagion are
you, that in one night the pestilential va
pours, and blue fo%s arising from your car
case, would infedt forty tons of hay. 1
pray you to walk on, and. leave me and
mine. You are upon the verge of another
world, and we wish no connexion with
you. Retire, I fay.
Citizen. Walking through ten miles of
heavy sand has, I allure you, given me
considerable of an appetite. Could I have
a bit of victuals for my money? The ta
verns are every where (hut againlt meâa
luncheon of cold beef, a (lice of ham, a bit
of bacon, or a chunk of breadâyou might
lurely venture to reach one or more of
these articles to me on the point of a pitch
fork. t
Farmer. Beef for a man in your situa
tion !âYou are, beyond all. doubt, raving
mad, and light-headed. If you were in
your right senses you would rather a(k for
tartar-emetic, jalaps, purges, collery mor
bus, hippecacahna, doses of Spani(h flies,
and cartloads of drugs, physics, and me
dicines of every denomination and defcrip.
tion. For God's fake leave me ; talking
with you is like talking with a ghostâ
lioift your black flag, and away to your
Potter's field !
Citizen. I want no physic. I (hall now
depart from your borders and return home;
tut not without firft observing to you, that
the common duties of humanity between man
and man, should have as much weight wiih
a rational creature as the great duty offelf
prejervalton itfelf; and be equally obfervtd.
Cowards shrink from danger : the brave,
when necessary, meet it with fortitude :
and, trull mc, you will find, in at leall
ninety instances out of a hundred, that
cowards perilh through the very effects of
their fears, while the firm escape and en
joy a comfortable length of exiitence.â
Adieu.

Extract si nm the Minutes of the Synod of
Philadelphia, met at York-town, 011 the
28th day of Augult, 1793, and continued
by adjournment.
THE Synod of Philadelphia, taking into
their molt Orions coiifideration the very
critical situation of the affairs of these Unit
ed States, at this eventful period ; the
great degree of insensibility in matters of
religion that has prevailed in all ranks of
men amonglt us, notwithstanding the many
great judgments and deliverances, which,
as a nation, we have heretofore experi
enced; the prevalence of infidelity, and
the negleit and opposition discovered by
many with regard to the inftirutions of
chriltianity, and the mediation of our Lord
and Saviour Jesus Chrifttaking also into
view, the alarming and increaling judg
ments of God that are abroad in the earth,
the convulsions that have taken place in
Europe, and the probability that our guilty
country may be involved in similar calami
ties ;âunanimoufly agreed, in appointing
Thursday, the 24th day of October next,
to be obferveo as a day of farting and pray,
er, by all the churches under their care.
The Synod molt earncllly exhort and en
join upon pcrfons of all ranks in our com
munion, to lay aside 011 that day their usual
business, and unite in humble and earnest
Applications to the throne of grace, thro'
our divine Mediator, that God would im
press the minds of all with such a sense
of his Majesty, as the great Governor in
the affairs of men and nations, and of their
obligations to him as their beneficent Pre
server and Guardian, as shall lead them to
glorify HIM in whose hand their breath is,
and whose are all their ways ; that he would
inspire our rulers and magiltrates of all
ranks with a (acred and pointed regard to
his providence and approbation, and such
wisdom to discern, and such refolntion to
pursue, the measures that conduce to the
public 'inter*ft at this critical period, as
may, under the favour of heaven, iVcure
to thefft dates the continuance of the bleiT
ings 'they enjoy that he would prosper
the labours of the hulbandman ; an eft the
progress of irreligion and immorality ;
grant a gracious effufion of the Divine
Spirit's influences; restore peace to our
frontiers; protest our commerce; disap
point all who may have deligns unfavoura
ble to the tranquillity and prosperity of
these states ; and make us a wife, a pious,
aed a happy people.
