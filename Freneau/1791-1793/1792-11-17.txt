FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE.
PARIS, Sep. 17 â25.
THE enemies of France are every day
becoming more formidable. All
the advices from Germany, Spain, and
Sardinia, agree in the accounts they give
of the expensive preparations which art
carrying on against us, The king of
Great Britain, in his German charadler
of Elector of Hanover, has not merely
avow ed his intentions of taking part with
the two great courts, but has been itioil
conspicuous and forward in engaging
others to coalesce. His Hanoverian mi
cifter, as we havcfeen officially notified to
the assembly, has tiavelled over Germany,
to make converts to the cause of the
Princes. The king of Spain has thrown
off the flimfy disguise of neutrality, and
assuredly declared liimfelf for holti it leg.
Sardinia, at the fame time, no longer
occasion for jesuitism, but threatens de
termined war.
The general idea of the plan of the
crufadii against France is as follows.
1. " The united armies of'Piuflia, and
Auftriahave no hope beyond the reduc
tion of the northern departments, in
which, if pofiible, they mean to plant
themselves for the winter, not entering
Paris, but holding the chief quarteis ot
the camp at St. Denis.
2. " The whole of the southern fron
tier to be menaced and held in check by
Spain and Sardinia, whik a diverlion may
be made by the Swiss Cantons.
3. " Thus invested to the Souih and
England, for they cannot fepai ate
she King of England from the Elector
of Hanover, is to. threaten thedepavtments
opposite to the Channel, that the panic
ftiay be general: and thus assailed on all
fides, the mediation of England is to be
offered for the establishment of a limited
monarchy."
We have the omens of new massacres
in Paris. The minister of justice h s
found, that lince the maffjere, between
four and five hundred persons have been
imprisoned in Paris by the municipality,
the feÂ£tions, ar.d individuals; some of
them upon crimes alledged, but most of
them on mere undefcribed suspicion.
The assembly knowing well that the i nil -
Tiuations of these ruffians are signals for
execution, have taken meaft'.res to save
these poor wretches from the fu y of the
mob.
During the night of Sunday and Mon
day lad, the mob here broke open the
jewel-office belonging to the crown, and
Hole out of it all the jewellery and rega
lia.
The treasury deposited in this place,
comprising diamonds and other precious
ilones, the r:ch presents made by foreign
princes, &c. was by far more valuable than
that belonging to any other cro-ned
head in Europe. The total value of the
diamonds, pearls, coloured (tones, and di
amond ornaments of the king's dress alone,
is estimated at about one n illion sterling.
Merlin, member of the commit
"tee oFtrfearcheSj has given the following
account of the robbery :
At at night, a patrole of the sec
tion of .the- Thuilleries perceived a man
who waÂ» descending the lamp post of the
jewellei/ office. On seizing him his poc
kets wtre found full of jewels, diamonds,
gold atid fiiver. Another robber in at
tempting to escape by throwing himfelf
fiom the top of one of the pillars, was
â wounded in the head and taken; he was
covered with brilliants, and had a handker
chieffuH of gold and fiiver, diamonds, sap
phires, emeralds and topazes. The nati
onal assembly has this morning named
four of its members to be present at the
iuformation of this affair. Two confi >-
erable diamonds, one named the Regent,
worth 500,0001. sterling, and the Souci,
sre carried off, with ail the most precicu s

brilliants. The value is estimated at feve
ral millions sterling.
In consequence of this depredation, ar
order was issued instantly to (hut the bar
ricrs, and search every person who at
tempted to pass. At the fame time cou
riers were dispatched on every road lead
ing from the capital with orders to (lop
every carriage they met. Two of tht
thieves were taken into Custody.
The pearls of the crown are in number
five hundred arid thirteen, of which four
hundred and eighty are not Jet, and thirty
three are placed in !ome ornaments worn
by the queen, whieh were shewn to the
commiffionrrs.
The rubies are two hundred and thirty
of which number an hundred and ror.y

:hain of one of the king's watches.
There are an hundred and th rty-fbur
"aphires,three oriental amethyfts,and eight
ayrian granates.
Of the diamonds, one called the regent,
if the weight of 146 carats, is estimated
it 12 millions of French livres, or more

it 12000 livres, the worst at 200 ; the to
:al value of the coloured stones is 360,604
ivres, or about fifteen thousand pounds.
The diamonds above mentioned arefe
jarate from those made up into different
irnarnents lor the king's ufej the value of
which latter is 6,834,4-9Â° I'vrcs, or m ire
:han twohundred & fifty thousand pounds.-
riu total value of the diamonds, pearls,

On the 2i ft of September the national

closed in a cheerful and truly patriotic
stile, by addrefftng the national conven

that day convened, and resigning the great!

The assembly decreed, that they would
proceed in 3 body to the Thuilleries, and
ast as guard to the convention. Ye funs
it def otsfay, is not this a tell of patrio
tism, and does it 'not remind you of the
great Cine matus at the plough ?
The convention entered convention
hall at half part one on this fame day 1 amid
inceffaÃt plaudits, aftd proceeded to bafi
nefs. M. Petiori, Prefiderit of France, to
refute in the national palace. After'orga
nizing the house, they proceeded to cere
monies, but they seemed all of opinion
that equality (hould be observed; that their'
great bufmefs was to free the people, by
hurling monafchs to deTlruftion : they fi
nally declared, that there could be no Con
stitution but that which is aÂ«cepted by the
people ; that law tnuft resume its empire ;
that territorial propeny and the fruits of
induflfy are sacred ; that they will con
cert the mode which the French people
at large shall pursue, to nvanifeft their opi

that those laws and powers which had not
been abrogated or suspended, shall be prc

one declaration which ought not to be de

debate arose, but finr.lly, the following de

king, recovering his fall, called out to ltoj
their vengeance, faying, I am not wound

Lyons, Sept. 13. In imitation of the ex
ample set by the Parisians, the prisons it
this city were forced open, and the prison
ers, though defended by the municipal of
ficers, were all slaughtered indiscriminate
ly ; nothing could exceed the fury of tht
populace, and the effefks it produced art
too lhocking to relate ; several heads were
carried through the streets. One of the
prisoners had escaped from his murderers
and came to the hall of the magistrates, tc
implore protection ; but even his judge:
could not save him from the monsters whe
were in pursuit of him, and who cut hiii
in pieces, with several more unfortunate
citizens and prisoners, in the very presence
of the officers of jurtice.
At night the bloody scenes increased ; e
very moment the prisons were opened ; ;
great number of priests were murdered :
one of them was disguised in women':
cloathes : the {laughter did not cease til!
the streets were covered with dead bo
dies.
An infurreftion has ulfo taken place 21

from being mafl'acred by a party of nati

London, Sept. 21. The corporation ol
Dublin, in Common-Hall, on the 24th
inft. took into consideration the petition oi
the Roman Catholics, who claim a right tc
equal immunities and privileges with the
Protestants. This petition the corpora
tion have rejected, as tending to overturi:
those principles on which the conftitutior
is founded.
The question between the Proteftanti
and the Catholics in Ireland is agitating
with much vigor. The appointment ol
delegates, by the latter, having been treat
ed as illegal by some persons of considera
ble weight, the opinions of Mr. Butler and
Mr. Burfton, two of the leading counsel
there have been taken upon it, who have
declared the measures to be one of the un
alienable right; of the nation.
Since Monday lafc, er.trier, for goods fpr
different parts of America, to the amount
of i 60,0001. have been made at the cus
tom-house.
ExtraÃ of a letter from Dublin, Sept. 13.
"It is find thatinthecourfeoflafl week
a subscription, amounting to ifcretf millions
fteriing, was completed among' the Roman
Catholic gentlemen and merchants of Ire
land, for the purpose of purchasing lands in
North-America.
The objeÂ£t of this purchase is said to be
two-fold ; firft, that these lands may serve
afe an asylum to which those people may
retire, should they fail in obtaining what
they now seem to consider as cffentiaLto
the being of freedomâthe elettive fran
chife. The second object is, that they
may be a source of profit, should their situ
ation in their native country be made such
as to induce them to remain in it.
This measure of the Catholics, should
it be carried into execution, must very
deeply interefl the national welfare. No
thing has occurred in Irifli politics, within
the present century, more worthy the at
tention of the politician and the flatef
man.
Brufels, Sept. 22. After. the events of
the 14th infl. the news of which you pro
bably have heard, the armies under the
command of the Duke of Brunfwick, ha
ving turned the mountains of Clermentois,
found the armies of Luckner, Dumourier,
and Kellerman, very advantageously polled
in a chain of mountains parallel to the ri
ver of Ainfe.
The combined armies offered battle tc
the French, which they refufed. It thei
became necessary to turn a corps of 20,00 c
men under M. Dumourier, who occupied
a height which is considered as the key tc
the pafles. The intrepidity of the troop:
conquered all obltacles; they"attacked and
took a battery of cannon, arid M. Du
mourier, perceiving they would turn his
flank, took flight. The two other general:
followed his example, and the French ar
my passed the Ainfe in the greatest distress,
and fled towards Chalons, where it is
thought they did not flop.
In this retreat, from four to five hun
dred prisoners have been made, and they
loft a great number of people, four piece;
of cannon, sixty waggons, and an infinite
quantity of baggage.
M. de Sombrueil, aid-de-camp of the
Prince of NafTau, has gained great credit
in this action by his valor and intelligence.
It is understood that the king of Prussia de
corated him with the military orders on
the field of battle.
All the difficult paflage.s are now forced,
and the combined armies have the keys to
Paris, except the battle which the patriots
are to fight in the plains of Champagne,
behind Chalons ; but it is feared their cou
rage will not await the Auflrians and Pruf
iians.
The combined armies bewail Prince
Charles de Ligne, whose courage was the
cause of his death.
LONDON.
To write now in favor of the people is
deemed seditious, and a libel on govern
ment. In the name of common sense.
what would soon be the people's conditi
on, if they were left to the will of govern
ments, with no friend of spirit to plead
for them.
According to the modern definition of a
libel, every new fpaper which is not in favor
of miniflers, is liable to information daily,
by the attorney-general ; for if to abuse
government be to libel it, do not all prints
of the above description abuse it ? Point
ing out its corruptions and deformities, is
abusing it to all intents and purposes.
" Reprobate and vilify the friends of
the people," is the cry from a certain
quarter. 'If we can frighten John Bull
from encouraging any salutary reform in
parliament, and make him terrified at the
appearance of his real friends, wc then
may pick his pocket at our pleasure.'
The advocates for despotism, though
they lose their arguments, will not lose
their holds, while .their patrons have the
treasury in keeping. Take that away, and
down goes the zeal of their adherents at
once.
If Mr. Secretary Dundas should go to
the Eafl-Indier this funimer, inflead of his
uninviting spot near Edinburgh, we advise
him not to touch at Botany Bay; his popu
larity is no greater there than in Scot
land.
We slated in our lafl the combined ar
mies flationed before Thionville having ta
ken the height of St. Michel,neas that place,
after an obflinate aftioil, in which they loft
five hundred men. It now appears that
the prince of Hohenlohe was killed in the
contest. He was an experienced general
and the commander in chief of one of the
three great armies, deflined to ait againll
France.
A flratagem of General Wimpefn, the
commander of Thionville is much praised.
On the nth infl. he made a prodigious fire
in the market place, the flames of which
were mistaken by the enemy, for a fire a
mong the lioufes, kindled by their bombs.
They immediately made an assault. A de
tachment from the garrison took them in
flank, while the cannon' of the place play
ed upon their front, and they were prefent
lv routed yrith the loss of three hundred
men, left dead upon the spot. Upon the
whole, Thionville has already coftthe ene
my a thousand men, belideo an irumen le
quantity of cannon and bombs funk in the
Morelle.

" A private account received yesterday
from Luxemburg, said that the operations
of the army were far from having beer
attended with the success that had beei:
expe&ed ; that the Hungarian grenadiers
had been very roughly treated, the van
guard of the Prussians repulsed, and thai
the army, instead of marching straight or
to Paris, was intrenching itfelf on the fron
tiers of France. It was further said, thai
the king of Prussia shewed already some
marks of disgust, and had repeatedly re
proached the emigrants for having afihrec
him, that half the army would come ovei
and join them ; that the towns would oper
their gates, and a considerable party make
head in the interior of the kingdom. Ye
sterday the account was that Thionville
had been at last taken, but it is now con

before it was in reality, no doubt for the
fame purpose ; the allied armies have now
been a month opposed against the enemy,
and if they have taken Thionville, it Is the
only conquest yet reaped by their arms, foi
Longwi was the fruit of treason, not ol
valor.

Short Remarks of: the present unpopular In
dian War, and pointing * out the means ti
vegociate an honorable Peace, much dejirec.
by a majority of both parties, on terms oj
reciprocity.
THE merits and demerits of the present
very unpopular Indian war have been
much difcuifed during the late session ol
Congress and in our daily papers; but in
no instance more thoroughly or justly than
in a small pamphlet lately publilhed, and to
be fold by William Young in Philadelphia,
entitled, " Minutes of Debates in Council, on thi
batiks of ' the Ottawa river, November s - 91, fa:d
to be held there by the chiefs of the seve
ral Indian nations, who defeated the army
of the United States on the 4th of that
month."
Owing to these discussions, and to the
sense of the nation, the executive of our
government have adopted various means
to induce a treaty, but \\ ithout any good ef
fect ; because the superstitions and preju
dices of the nations we are at war with
have been ignordnce
or inattention in those who have been en
trusted with the proposed negociations;
and our ambaft'adors h: ve not been allow
ed to enter into the enemies councils, to
deliver their embattles, but it is said have
been put to death. Hence, some, and
particularly the .tirft promot of the war,
and-thofe who have an immediate interest
in its continuance, wifii uj to believe, that
war alone, and not peace, is the objeil of
our enemy, and therefore, that we ought
to redouble our forces and our expe â¢ js,
to reduce them to a proper sense ol their
perfidy, as their noble spirit is improper l y
called.
The causes of the war, pointed out by
the Indian nations in the above mentioned
pamphlet, and particularly ourdifregard to
their ancient customs, manners, and pre
judices, are the occalion of their invetera
cy and hatred: and our pride, insolence
and falfehood, displayed in some of our
publications, and our contemptuous treat
ment of thern on various occasions, as
pointed out in thac pamphlet, ought to be
removed, before we can expect them to
place any confidence in us.
It may perhaps new, after our several
defeats, be kon'Jlly ajkcd, how we are to in
duce the natrons with \\ hom we are at
war, to listen to our propositions for peace ?
I know that nothing, of equal importance,
is more eaiily to be accomplilhed ; a pero
ral of the above mentioned pamphlet will
point out the means, and our former mis
takes; but if it does not do this so fully as
might be wiihed, there are, no doubt, ma
ny among us, who are acquainted there
with ; and whose patriotism wouid induce
them to awe undertaking, were they to be
called upon : or, they would at lead give
the necetfarv information. All with whom
I have conversed on the fubjeft, who are
acquainted with the Indian character and
politics, do declare, as I do, from an inti
mate knowledge of them, that peace with
the United States, upon just and honorable
terms, is their firlt and most deiired object;
and easily attainable by us, on principles of
reciprocity.
How strange soever these observations
may appear to those among us, who
ior a war of extirpation, or perfect cort
queft, or however dilfonant from their
doctrines these positions may be found, yet
I judge they are the best principleÂ® to build
our reliances upon, for a permanent peace-
This accomplilhed, upon true principles,
we Ihonld fee the nations haftehing to em
brace us, as they did our ancestors; and
and then ihould we fee superstition combi
ning with inclination to implant in the
minds of the rising generation, on both
lides, the most friendly sentiments; such
sentiments and difpoiitions having once
obtained, will be the Itrongeft barrier for
iheir own preservation. Opposition to the
"uperilitions and prejudices of a people ;
railing at them for periidy which they
were never guilty of; and insolent threats
of chastisement they know it is not in our
power to inflict, are not the means from
which to expect fuccefsful negociations, or
:o produce mutual confidence and good
faith.

5 I R,
" After the clofepf the last feffio'n of Con
gress, I saw with much concern the report
of the committee appointed to enquire in
to the causes of the failure oi' the expedi
tion under Major Gen. St. Clair, of the
Bth of May, 1-921; which having been pre
sented to the house in the 1 alt moments of
the session, was ordered to be printed, and 1
has iince circulated in the public newfpa- i
pers throughout the United States, con-'
taining suggestions molt of tliem founded
upon exparteinvefligation, which have been
underltood in a sense very injurious to my
reputation.
Learning tliat the present day was ap- '
pointed for taking into consideration the I
above-mentioned reportâl have waited
with anxious expeÂ£tation for some act of
the house enabling me to attend the pro
gress of the examination upon which they
are about to enter, for the purpose of fur- ;
nilh'ng such information and explanations [
might conduce to a right understanding
of facts, in which I am so materially im
piicated---The failure of a proposition
which I am informed was made to the
honfe with that view, has added to my so
licitude afld regret.
Thus (ituatcd, I feel myfelf called upon
to aSk of the juSlice of the honfe that some
mode may be devised, by which it will be
put into my power to be present during the
course of the intended enquiry, as well to
hear the evidence on v, hich the several al
legations tontained in the report are foun
ded, as to offer the information and ex
planations to which I have alluded.
To this Step I am impelled by a persua
sion that an accurate and fatisfattory in
stigation cannot otherwise be had with
equal advantage, if at all. And my entire
reliance upon the equity and impartiality
of the house will not permit a doubt to
exist 011 mv part, that such an investigation
will be exclusively the object of their de

A letter to the fame effect from Major I
Hodgdon, quarter-master-general of the
late army, was presented and read.
A motion was made to rtfer these let

A motion was made to refer the petition
of Henry Bowes to the Secretary of the
Treasury, which was negatived. It was
then moved to fend it to a feiect commit

been used in the war as ahofpital and bar
racks, for about two years, and during
that time had futfered much damage.
The petitioner applied to Mr. Turner,
a commiSlionerforthef.-ttlement of claims,

Mr. Freneau,
GOVERNMENTS are the more perfeÂ£t
the left room they leave for the eXercifsof
venality and corruption.
The belt government is inadequate toi
the purpofe> for which it was instituted,
uXilef the officers thereof be men of unfiia
ken integrity.
The citizens of the.several United States
of America, agreeably to their cor.ftitu
tion, elect to represent thern in Ccngrefs,
men, as they fuppefe, of integrity and abi
lity. To them they entraft all their poli
tical concerns. .
This being the cifeâQucre. Is it jufti
fiable in the delegates, or is it acting agree
ably to the fpirlt of their or
the wNhes of their coriftittients, that the
rnoft important concerns of the nation,
nay, proportions on which depend the lia
bility and prosperity of government, be
referred to the determination of an indi
vidual? I fay determination, from reflect
ing on the well "known infiuc-nce great
names have on Come minds.
Did the good people throughout the uni
on, in their elections, contemplate thff
transfer of their delegated right?
Is the mode confiitutional ?
In fine, is not the legiiiative body fully"
competent to all the purposes for which
they have.been appointed ?' 1 ' iVi'inn'i aww iWMin'ivr
From the American Daily Advertifcr.
A S it appears by the public prints
J~\ that there will be a contest for the
olrice of Vice President, which becomcs
vacant on the 3d of March next, and
which must be suppled by the free fuf
frage of the people, it may not be deem
ed improper, in relation to those princi
ples which fhonld be held sacred, to
make some comments on the relative
pretentions of those who aie fjid to be
competitors for this important station.
This trait in the executive department of
uur government, is among the mcft impor
tant of those which distinguish it from the
monarchies of Europe ; and as its prefor
mation must in a great meafare depend
upon the political condud of those who
fill it, a candid enquiry into the charac
ters of the competitors becomes a matter
of public right. It belongs to a free peo
pie to guard themselves from injury ; and
to this great principle the forms of cere
mony or complaisance for perfens must,
upon all occasions, yield, liven the com
petitors, therefore, however painful the
scrutiny might be, should console them
selves under the refledion, that upon the
preservation of the principle, the fafety of
their country depends.
In particular circles several gentlemen
have been spoken Â©ffor the office in ques
tion, but at present all others seem to be
withdrawn from view, and the contest to
reft solely between John Adams, Esq. and
Governor Clinton. To their compara
tive merits, therefore, as the only compe
titors, I (hall confine these observations.
To trsat of them in the affirmative line
would be useless, as it could lead to no
fatiafaÂ£ftry conclusion ; for every person
will admit that, in some refpedi*, they both
poffe:s the requisite qualifications: that
both, for instance, possess an adequate 9a
pacity for the difchargeof it 3 official func
tionsâare of fufficierit 3ge and standing in
America l âand have likewise rendered
important services to their country. To
fix the preference, their merits must be
viewed from a difFerent ground. The
objedion3 which apply to each must be
fcanrrcd, and he ag inft whom the more
weighty app'y> rejeded.
To Mr. Adams it has been objeded,
that he is attached to a government of
king, lords, and commons ; and that the
allegation is true, it is to be prefuir.ed,
will not be controverted. His writings,
entitled, "A Defence of the American
Constitutions," and " Discourses upon
Davilla," fully demonstrate it. If it
could be supposed that doubts existed up
on this point, extrads from those publi
cations should be now furnifhed ; they
shall however immediately, if any intima
tion of the kind be given. And to Mr.
Clinton, an objedion of a difFerent kind,
his opposition to the present constitution,'
before its adoption, has been urged.
These, I believe, arc the principal ob
jedions made to either : they are, how
ever, those only upon which I shall make
any comment. To whom, then, does the
stronger one apply ? On whose political
principles, at the present moment, would
the good people of these states with
greater propriety bestow their fandion'?
To form a found decision upon this
inteiefting question, two others, on which
it depends, should be previously fettled,
First, Which of these gentlemen's politi
cal sentiments wander fartheft from the
present constitution ? and secondly, On
which fide does the greater danger lie, in
the progress of the government, of an un
due inclination towards the form preferred
by Mr Adams, or that ascribed to Mr.
Clinton J
With refped to those of Mr. Adams,
it will be readily perceived, that they de
pait, in all the great outlines, frgm the
pi efent constitution. The establishment of
a government of king, lords, and commons,
would entirely subvert the present one,
which rests on the free fuffrage of the peo
ple. Two diftind orders with hereditary
rights, would be ereded over them, and
they reduced to a limited portion of au.
thority only, forming a kind of balance
against those higher and hostile orders.
With refped to those of Governor Clin
ton, it is to be observed, that they have
always ranged within the republican theo
ry. His maxim has been, to keep the go
vernment, in all its departments, essentially <
conncded with the people. The question
about the constitution involved only a mo
dification of this principle. Besides, it is
to be presumed that many of his objedians i
have been done away by the amendments;
so that, in fad, it must be deemed, in all
its parts, as nearly correspondent with his
own theory, as the contrariety of senti
ment, always difpbyed on a fubjed of
1 such importance,could reafonab'y admit of.
The charaderiftic difference, then, in
their political principles limply amounts
to this, that these of Mr. Adams vary ra
dically froiti the constitution, in the main
1 features of the republican system : whereas
those of his competitor harmonize with it
in that elfential point. In addition to which
' it is of importance to observe, that upon
1 the establishment of the constitution, and
prior to the adoption of amendments,
Mr. Clinton's opposition ceased ; and
' that, on the contrary, since that event,
Mr. Adams has, in the discourses above
' alluded to, endeavoured, by all the argu
ments in his power, to inspire, in the minds
of his countrymen, a diftrult of a govern
' ment founded on the people alone, and to
prepare them for the gradual introdudion
of hereditary orders in the (late.
In regard to the other quefcion, On
which fide doe's the gre-ter danger lie, of a
more probable inclination towards the sub
version of the republican system, by the
: introdudion of a government of an higher
tone, or too great a relaxation of its prin
ciples, I am persuaded that so person can
seriously entertain a doubt on the fubjed.
He muit be little Ikilled in the political
balance, and the true complexion of the
' times, who fufpeds, in any degree, a pre
ponderance of the latter evil. That the
government may {land on its present
ground, is certainly the wish of those to
whom a contrary i'entiment lias been at
tributed: for let the objedionsof those who
' were opposed to it, where opposition was
made, be examined, and it will be found
1 that the space which separated the body of
â¢ the opponents from that of its advocates,
was a narrow in fad, the dif
ference, in many in fiances, vuas but trifling,
1 and that this has beeu generally acccm
' modated by the amendments .The truth
of this position has been so well eftablilhed
by events, that to doubt it, argues a mind
so inveterately blinded by prejudice or in
terest, that the force of truth cannot reach
it. No danger than of a vibration back
need be apprehended ; for, in truth, no
. person wilhes it. On the other hand,
it mult be admitted, that the evident len-
I dency is in the opposite diredion. A
particular enumeration of those measures
| which contribute to give this bias, is at
present unnecessary, and would certainly,
in their developement, exceed the bounds
of these obfervatiens. For the truth, how
ever, of the remark, I beg leave to appeal
to the judgment of every impartial and
well-informed American.
If, then, the good people of these states
wish to preserve their government as at
present, eledive in its form and limited
in its poweis, can they hesitate in deciding
to which of these gentlemen the prefer
ence should be given ? An unequivocal
declaration of their sentiments upon this
point, thus exprefled, would hereafter be
felt by the candidates for public favour,
and refpeded. It would give a republi
can tone to the American charader, that
might tend to preserve their liberties
forever. No cor.fideration of local attach
ment, should interpose to defeat a mea
sure, which their interest requires and
their judgment didates. For the securi
ty of thole great principles upon which
their revolution was founded, and their
present government rests, their union
fhomld be firm, solid and indissoluble.

Perhaps there is no science more entertaining
and uleful than geography. It reveals the dis
coveries of travellersâthe remarkable curiosities
of all countries, in nature and artâthe fituari
on of provinces, cities, towns villages, rivers,
and mountainsâin fine, the history, manners,
customs, laws, farces, revenues, and government
of different nation**
It is an old observation, that si there is not a
fen or daughter cf Adam, but has some concern
with geography," and that a knowledge of this
science is indilpenlable towards the ffudv of his
tory with advantage or fatisfa&ion. Indeed a
man unacquainted with if, cannot discourse on
t! e nmoft common newlpaper topic of the day
without betraying his ignorance.
So much for geography generally* With ref
pstt to the prel'ent plan, let it fuffice to remark,
thatGuthrie's Geography has been long acknow--
Judged to be the best in the English language;
however, the account of America in it has, fiom
obvious reasons. been very erroneous and defec
tive. The errors of former editions will be cor'-
re&ed, and the defetfs fuj.plied, by gentlemen of
abilities, who have engaged to superintend this
undertaking, and to "avail of all thÂ«
information that can be procured, to render it
the most complete edition extant.
The Printer earneltly fjfidts the support of
his fellow citizens throughout ihcf-United States :â¢
and as no deposit is required, and every fubferu
berwill be at liberty to withdraw his name, if,
on trial, he fiiould disapprove of the work, he
hopes the friends of science, and of Americamarts
and manufactures will cheerfully aau early pat
ronize this ufeful work, the greatest and jnoft
ex pen five., probably, ever yet attempted inAme
jica, in the tipograpical line, the Encyclopedia
