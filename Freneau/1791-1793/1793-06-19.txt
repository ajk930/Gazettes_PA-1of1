It is not so fill-prizing, as it is with regret,
we observe, the unprovoked and incoulif
tent part, the British havetaken i-p the con
cerns of France. They are \\ ith you, the
moll enlightened people in the eastern lie -
mifphere âthey boall extravagantly, and
with much reason too, of the excellence of
their conltitution âthey profefs to know,
and to enjoy, the true principles of free
dom to thecoma ynity, combined with the
energy and digji.ty of government; they
bellow out for the roaflbeefof Old \ ngiand
for liberty and property ; ar.d be hold these
champions, enlisted under tiie banners of
proud iiifulting tyrants, to exterminate
from the globe every noble fentinient they

fiavery upon a great nation, which of all
others they ought,to join a:id protect ; they

lore inexcusable. It is to be feared, that
thj period is not dirtant, when, unless
they reform their boalled government,
theymuft according to the pretf'/iion if
one of their liiftorians* retire to their
children of America, for peace liberty and
fai'ety.
We nevertheless hope 3nd believe, that
the Great Being, who "rides the whirl
wind and directs the (torm of nature,"
will controul the tempeils of war, give .
you a good government, and restore the
republic to a (late of tranquility and hap
piness.
The hour of adverfityj is the time thar
tries mens foulsâAmerican fortitude was
n;ver displayed with so much glory as
when the servile legions of hritain and of
Germany, driving uil befoie then> at one
:ime almost literally annihilated our army,
which at other times was frequently so re
duced, naked, starved and frozen, as not
:o be fufficient in point of numbers to form
\ vanguard, for that of their enemies : But
Hough few they were brave and hardy men,
g for and happily lor us we
:ad at thole periods, neither a Bumou
:eh nor an Arnold in the chief com
â¢land. Despair never entered the doors of
-ongrefsâand the bright tiune of patrio
tic virtue, ruse with the extremity of the
jccafion. Our magnanimous general, and
uir venerable fc-nators, gave to future ge
erations, at thole periods a leflon, and a
"pecimes offtabilitj, worthy of imitation.
The coitett which the French are embark
ed in bf ing in its object similar to ours, and
embracing also every conlideration that caa
render life and victory definable, will again
convince the tyrants of tfte earth, that true
I'atriotifm is invincible.

Certainly not. Awaken then my country

of the all-conquering Britons, by adopting
their principles, which are surely moi\
conge.nil with the spirit of our Govern

Sympathetic congeniality ot sentiment be

emiff.iries, has happily done awav ail ani
molity, except among a few hot headed
republicans. I (hall now mention one
more reason, why we should renounce the
French, and cultivate the friendfhip of the
Englifli. It is the difference in the forma
tion of their respective frames. There is
a peculiar excellence in the contexture of
::n Englishman's body. The blood that
flows in his veins is of a Superior quality to

the fa ire ft fiir.ple of the great bedv if our

volution, aiid that in the nature oi thing?
it could not be otheruife. In pirticula:

nan ulio is an enemy torepub:ican govern

a government at home. This is ag
â¢o the uattue of man and the retiton o'
hings. And on this ground, if I had n<
. 1. tii ulnr evidence to guide my judgment.
I (liould be Aire that the cause of the Frencl
evolution muff be popular in general, anr
unfitfhionablein pnriictilar places. Let an;
man, whoby talking, and hoping, iff

general sense of the people is again!! tl <
French revolution, make the trial by quit
ing his part'cular c rcle. and harangu'u
before a city meeting, or a cotinty elec

pie he hopes the duke ol Brunfwick will dc

let him be lilly enough to try this experi
ment, and he will not he long in discover
ing how much he has been out in his reck
oning. There is indeed a fe:ret confei
oufneft of the general sentiment ol tiie
country on this fubjefl, in t.'ie mod zealou
enemies of French republicanism, whir'
their conduct fully evinces ; for wheneve'
(except ill a few u guarded cafe-.) the)
vent their doflrine to the public thro' th
newspapers. they do not speak tlieii mean
in; in direst terms, hut go to work col-
Mterally by a ft ting of faOs, oi
touching the firing of compaffien for rh t
iate king, or setting out in Orong colour:
particular evils blended in lr.eafures ami
vents good in themselves ; thereby hiding
is far as they can, from the reader, thai
.lie true contest at present in France is be
tween liberty and tyranny ; between re
publicanifin and royaltyâor, in one word,
lietween the people and the enemies of the
people.
I n order to Comprehend fully the com
.lexion of America in relation to the af
fairs of France, we must attend to three
everal forts, or characters of people found
among us. The firft fort is that which 1
lave all along spoken ips as the great nia r s
0 the community, friendly to the French
revolution from principle, from sentiment,
from interest, and from habits of mind
formed under our republican governments.
It comprehends the landed interest at large;
merchants, for the molt part, who are A
mertcan or Irifli by birth and also in capital,
together with the generality of tradesmen
and manufacturers. The class opposed to
the French revolution with decrees of ma
lignity varying according to' circumstances,
II made up principally out of the following
defcriptionsâNativesof monarchical coun
tries who have not llrength of mind to re
nounce their prejudicesâNatives of Ame
rica, educated and travelled abroad, who
have been weak enough to contract preju
dices contrary to the spirit of their own
countryâAmericans trading on foreign ca
pitalsâSuch as are attached to the Britifl:
form of gnvernment, and are grieved to
fee the republican form in their own coun
try fortified by the eftablilhment of a limi -
lar government in FranceâThe generality
of the holders of the public debt, who (by
whatever cause it is to be accounted for i
1 observe, are (with laudable exceptions
however) bitter againlf the French revo
lutionâLalHy, a proportion of the men
holding lucrative or durable offices in go

There is a third fort of people, who vi
brate between the other two, according
:o reports and intelligence from Europe.
Their mouths are open or flint, their
:ongues let loofc en this or that tide, just
iccÂ®rding to the new's at the Coffee honle.
Kvcvy lliip that arrives influences their
principles. Whilst Amiterdam v\astremÂ«
iling at the advance of Dumourier, they
iv illii il to be talked to as the friends of li
berty and France. On the victory of the
prince of Saxe, they stalked abroad the
iooniy prophets of perdition to France,
;nd i:dled off towards the enemies to her
.aufe. This description is more numerous
:han could b. wilhed, for the ho.iour of our

For the NATioNAt Gazette.
TT is an observation of ancient date, thai
i a weak or qirbbling advocate is oftei
more injurious to the cause he effoufes
than its mod formidable ()â¢
.his'f.'e have a recent iiifiance, in " A frienc
â¢op :iee," who. in his vcrbofe answer it
' \ -.-rit thews himfelf to be totally de
void of .tfndoor, and endeavov.i s to thri v
'ult in the eyes of the public, by fcrft ir.if
reprefvnting the molt clear find cxpl.ci
ihfervations ot his antagoailt.and then wa
ging war, not with the arguments oropiu
ions of Veritas, but with those whic'J < ri â 
in his own diftortcd imagination
Now what is this butto acknowledge, tha
he letters of Veritas co ntained unaufwrr
ible truths; truths which could not other'
wife be overset. than by the molt baft' arti-
Sees of nf.freprefer.tation ? So farisths
piecc lignt d A Friend to Peace, fro 11. beinj
n anfsver to the letters of \'eritas, that 1
think he might as w ell have addrelled Isii
observations to t!ie man in the moon as tc
that writer.
Vt ritas complains that ouf treaties witl
France are not recognized in the procla
mation ; that this omission, together with
liie general tenor of the proclamation, hsd
indiK. il many to suppose that theft; treaties
were no longer to be regarded ; and fug
belted that it would be prudent in the ex
;cutive to compose the public mind, by
giving filch explanations as appeared n cef
fary, on this, u.terefting f.ibjeft. Healfo
observed, that it could not be confident
with our duty or interest, to violate our
plighted faith, a .4 thereby involve our
selves in a war with Fram c:âWhat an easy
matter would it have been for the execu
tive to set this bulinefs in its true light I â
Had proper explanations been given, on
the appearance of Veritas's firlt letter, cr
on the publication of the numerous eifays
Â»n this fubjt ft, which had appeared i 1 \a
rious parts of the union, how much iinplea
fant altercation might have been avoided !
Hut such condejccnjlori, it seems. ought not
to be expeiled by the " iwinifli mul
titude""
Those who have perused the letters of
Veritas cannot but view with astonishment
the effrontery of his adversary in. publicly
hazarding the following aflertionsâ" Tiie
only apparent tendency of your letters is,
to intimidate the executive into some act
that 111alI infringe the neutrality of our na
tion, and involve us in a war, 011 the fide of
France, against all Europe." And againâ
â¢' The evident tendency of your letters is
for war, and you are not contented with
giving j ir own opinion on the fubjett, but
fay it is iue decided opinion of the union."
These groundless charges are contained in
r. lengthy exordium : after which thU
writer comes to "argument," as he calls
the subsequent part of his curious per
formance.
But how are we disappointed, when, in
stead of arguments tending to prove the
coniiftency of the proclamation with the
treaties between France and the United
Sfstes, v. e and the n?"t coltirr'i orrrp 3
w tli jiii c\ afive digrefiion on the v.ut.e fub
lifting b' twcen nations. The w ritcr mij-ht
have lin ed himfelf much troub'e, by tranf
ribing a page on this fubjeft from Grotius,
Puff. ndorl, or Vattell ; of his knowledge
i which authors he m sket a moll pedantic,
l.fplav. Fe then proceeds (diffulVly e:i
>uj*h, God knows,) to f!:e\v that we are c.t
r?eace with Great-Britain ; and. co.pfe
qnently, are as much friends to that nation
as to V ranee. He proceeds to ct rrbat the
lydra of war, created by his ov, n i:r i la
;ion ; and concludes with a variety of. co
lons to AijJ'uade us from hiking up ar::. f. . I
;\nd fncli is now the conduct of every fyco
l>hantic or aril'ocratic scribbler in Ameri
ca, whenever any tiling is (aid in tavour of
France, or refpefting the obligation of
trca y j as if it were impofhble to W'llifuc
:efs to France, or to pit a*l for the faithful
performance Â»l" our treaties, without be
ing disposed to go lo \v r.
111 oj>pol)tion to the opinion ofVer*ta%
'that the citizens of thffe dates, from one
extren.iiy of the Union to the.other, are
'irmly attached to the caufe'ot France â
it is laughable enough to be told, in lub
tance, by the Friend to Peace, that this as-
Vrtion is coiitradiiled 1 y the proclamation
jf tlie only executive officer, who haÂ« eon-
Vituttonal authority to speak the ftrCof
he Union ; and that the prelident mud be
ight, lince his opinion lias been apj rovrdby
i number of merchant? and traders in Phi
adelphia and Baltimoreâha ! ha ! ha 1
But what ft ems molt provoking to this
a ritcr js, the declaration of Veritas, that,
lowever " the little buz of the ariltoirauc
"ew and their contemptable minions, of
pecu'atars. tories. and hiritifh cmifTaries,""
nay be raife<l against the glorious cause of

'â¢ Agreeably to my protnife, I row rakf
up my pen to give yon fmie account of the
commencement held in the univerfitv o,
I'cnnfylvania on the joth of. Mjy ultimo
lor the purpose of conferring the degree o'
Doctor on the graduates in medicine.
The hour of tfn, in the forenoon wa
fixed upon for this important business
Anxotis to fee awd remark the procedure.
I was pmic 111 I to the moment. After
w aitnig for some time, expectation on tip
toe fancied tieiy nc ife the approach of the
pro< 1 flion. A 1: in ing. milling, Imflfrr
kind of a roife at length (pretty much lik.
that of a nor-wef.er amongst me leaves in

arid were niarihallca confronting the pro
feilors.
The scene, at this ft age of the business.
had truly a ludicrous appearance. It wa l
fir more like a court of judicature than a
place where honours or titles were to be
ccnferre I; so like aufljre jtidjes did the
one party appear, and so very like accused
jferfons the other.
The cultomary exordium being over,
ench graduate produced what he called a
thesis. Nothing could be more farcical or
fc'ifgullinj, particularly as it was but too
notorious that some were attempting to
defend, as their own, productions which
they had never written. So fhamefully
proud were they ot" their cornuted brains.
Each inquisitor had his victim previously
marked out lor examination, who proved
in I/aac, or a Scape Goat in proportion to
the good underftaiiding which fublifted be
tween the parties. After some time a con
versation took place between two of the
attors, in a language I did not underfland.
inquiring of a gentleman, who fat next
me, what was now ihe matter? I was an
'rtcred, -'A Latin thefts yet I doubt
much v i ether Cicero or Tacitus, if pre
l-'nt, could underltand one word, either of
r !ie thesis or dialogue. The gentleman
deled, " The man who examines is a half
r>rof t llbr in the inft tution, and at present
in avowed enemy to Latin, altho' he avail
d himlelf ot the olsfcurity of that lan
guage. when he had o'ccafion to publilh his
>robationary thelis to the world "
The exsf/ i'latiuti bt g concluded, next
me on the bulinefs ol conferring degrees.
! hU wai ihe mofl unaccountable part of
he business, lor the procrf in the'eonrfe of
tew miniites, by an inexplicable meta
norpholis, transmuted tiine simple fouig
>eâ . into as many doctors, by merely ex
ending to each a ltrip of parchr-.eni. and
uteri rig at the fame time a Latin exorcism :
he fpeil was a powerful one. The con
lufion was, however, really excellent. It

ditions are to be made to the monies indi
reflly t ravrn hither, as slated by the Se
cretary in his report of the 15th leb
179',, and as the linking fund is continu
ally increasing by means of the interrft
falling due upon the principal of the debt
purchased, it may with fafety be a'Xerted
that the capacity of the finking fund from
the 15th of February 17 3to the present
time, Ihould be at leall equal to 2;003, 000
dols. in actual cash.
It will be recolletfted that the sum of
416,885 dols. 75 cents, iscompofed of the
domeflic revenue preceding the end of i~yo,
and of course mull have been received in
cash previously to this timeâ I hat the fu u
of 1,388,452 dols. 23 r ents, is composed
of tlie fale3 of bills upon fhr.rt credits from
the I ;th December 1790 ta the end ofthe
y.ar 1792, and of course mud have been
received in cash previously to this timeâ
That the sum of 659,874 do's 34 c> nts, is
compolcd of the appropriations fur the
payment of the inter.it on the domellic
leht, which were received for so much by
the fubllitution of the principal borrowed
abroad ir. their Head, and it is ita I .ed !>v
the Secretary that of t ofe appropriation;
there remained unexpended 0:1 the 14th ol
February 1793, the sum of 1,395,
65 cents, end of course this lund cannot
be deficient of cash.
This flatement is taken from the report:
of the Secretary of the Treasury, and is
vouched to be corredtly taken ; and theft
fevcral futr.s are 11 ted by h'rn to be charg
able upon the sum of 5,114,696 do!s. 5c
cents, being the gross amount of all mo
nies and revenues on hand at the end ol
179 a.
The commifiioners for ptirchafing the
public debt are authorized by law to in veil
this enormous sum of 2,000,c00 dÂ®!s. in thf
purchase of llx per certs at twenty ihiilingt
(i the p .und, and it was recommended by
ihe Secretary of the Treasury during thi
\ijl fejjion of Congress, that their difevetio
Ihould be extended to the invelli'.tue of tV.is
fund at a rate as high as twenty-two [hi
lings and fixpencc in the pound.âSix pc>
cents are now at lixteen fbillings in the
pound, and other species of paper relative
ly liÂ»w, and no ingenuity or labor of ours
has been able to raise the price of them.
From this flatement of fails car.did re
sponses are requefled to the following
quefllons.
Whether the l'nvcfliture of 2,cro,occ
of dollars in the purchase of the public
debt, would not without a competition,
r.bforb ail the paper actually afloat in ths
markets of New-York, and
801 l on ?
Whether the deH would not be brought
up at lealt to its par value by evidencing
an ability to make such invelliture ?
Whether the public interest does not
call aloud for such an invelliture while the
debt remains under par ?
What are the various causes of this la
mentable effedt, the lou pr ice cf paper, il
there be not " fotr.ething rotten in the
Hate of Denmark."
When thefa interefling qneftiors are
candidly and fatisfaftorily answered, some
further propositions will be presented
equally interelling to the commnnitv in
general, and to the brotherhood in parti
cular.
