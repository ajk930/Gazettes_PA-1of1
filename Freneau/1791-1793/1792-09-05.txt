FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE,
liY THIS LAST ARRIVALS.
â¢ MADRAS, March 8.
Grand Army.
WE are extremely sorry that our ut
moll endeavours have not yet enabled us
to lay befoie our readers the particulars of
the treaty of peace concluded with Tip
poo : however, whilst the mind is kept
in fufpence as to the general detail, enough
lias tranfpited totlemonftrate that no peace
ever reflected more splendor on the arms
of Great liritain, or securing more perma
nent advantages to her interests âA
peace that has so effectually embraced the.
different ideas of oppi.li e parties, that it
cannot fail of enfuriiig the higliell appro,
bation of all.
In the present ir.ftance we have greatly
triumphed.â the valor of our troops lias
been to more essential purposes,
and their gallant exertions have been
ci'owned with the molt brilliant success :
they have elevated ihe J nglifh name in
India to the utmoit height of glory, anddi
reCted t>y the wisdom, and emulating thÂ«
ardor of their brave leader, have diftateci
a peace to the enemy, the beliegee
walls of his capitalâA peace which in it;
consequences will be piodu&ive of a vail
inflrx of wealth to their country.
Hitherto, or at leall for a number ol
years pafl, miftakcii policy l.bd shut up
trade on the Malabar Coafl, but the parti
tion treaties restores it to freedom, and o
pens the richest views to-commerce, whicl:
in itfelf is (Ji more real benefit than the ae
quiiltion of an empire.
In our s lalt courier we anticipated the ar
rival of the hollages in camp âIt was on
the 27th, instead of th 24th, ult. that the
important event took placeâ about twelve
o'clock the works of the fort of Serin
gapatam were crowded witty an innumera
ble multitude of people ; and the Sultan
was plainly d (covered amongst them,â
In a few minutes afterwards the young
princes made their app arance, they wert
condndted from the iljand to a large pavi
lion pitched for their reception, near Sib
bald's redoubt, about a mile from the
fort.
Here they were received by Sir John
Kenneway, who attended them, accompa
nied by an efco. t, to head-quarters
On entering the camp, they were faint
ed with nineteen guns ; and the part of 1 he
line they passed was under arms, &the offi
cers saluted.âLord Cornwallis fainted
them in 1 is tent, which was guarded by
battalion of Sepoys ; and they were the 1
formally delivered over io his Lordlhip,
by Gullum Ally B?g,the Sultan's Vackeel,
as hollages for the due performance ol
the treaty.
The scene was grand and ftfffftjfig, and
impressed all present with those feelings
which are not ealily delineated.
It was a proud scene to the conqueror?
â It was the moll humiliating to the van
quilhed.
An awful silence for a moment prevail
ed, and every one Itemed ablorbed in tlic
tumult of ideas which the occafron natu
rally called forth.
At length Gullum Ally approach!:':
Lord Cornwallis and under much agitati
on, addressed l is Lordlhip in the following
emphatic words: "These children," said
he, pointing to the young princes* whom
he then presented, " were this morning
thefons ofSnltan my mailerâtheir situa
tion is changed, and they mull now look
tip to your lordlhip as their father," âand
the tender and affectionate manner in
which his lordlhip leceivcd them, seemed
to confirm the truth of the exprefiion. 1
The attendants of the young princes
appeared altonilhcd at what they saw, ai d
their countenances were highly expreflive
of the fatisfaftion they felt in the benevo
lence of his lordship.

WEDNESDA Y, September 5, 1792.
Before they took their leave, his lord
ship presented a gold watch to each of
them, as a maik of his regard.
The next morning his Lordlhip made
them a visit at their tents, which arc
pitched near to the left of Tippoo's re
doubts.
His lordship alighted at the end of th<
avenue, and walked up to the tent,fa!utec
as lie paired by the Prince's guards.
They met his lordship at the entrance
and by their refpedtful behaviour, fheivec
that they held in plealing remembrance
the kind attention his lordlhip had fhtwi
to them.
At the extremity of the tent, arfd some
what elevated, a number of chairs were
placed ; here bis lordlhip seated hitnfeli
with the elJefl: prince on his right handj
and the younger on the left.
Sir John Ivenneway fat on one lide of
the Princes and Mr Cherry oa the othe>,
as his lordfliip's interpreters. The Vac
keels of Tippoo of whom one was the per
lon sent some time ago on an embafTy to
Conlt ntinople, and those of the Nizam
and Marrattas arranged themselves in the
fame order ; so that the whole formed z
lem.circle : after a converfauon of about
an hour, in whi.h t'ie Conllantiii' pie Am
b:iffador bore a considerable share his lord
lhip embraced the princes and gave to the
eldell a fufee mounted, and to the
youiif;elt, an elegant caie of pistols and in
return each of them presented his lordship
with a sword beetle an i Ottar were then
brought in, and his lordship immediately
afterwards withdrew, leading a prince i;i
each hand, to the extremity of >he rich
carpet which was spread on the ground
and embraced them with the utmolt cor
â¢ laltty. They remained on the spot some
:ime, paying their comp iments to tht
gentlemen of his lordfliip's suite, who fa
uted them.
They are very fine boys ; the eldefl i%
ibout eleven years of age, and appears to
Je very quick, fhre.wd, and penetrating :
he aildreffed he lordflirp in a very perti
nent fpcech, with a great deal of proprie
ty and without any kind of confufion or
smbarraiTmexit, and in the fame manner,
an being deiired by Gnllum Ally, lie re
peated some pafhtges from the Koran.
M he young-ell is remarkably handsome :
his featutes are very regular and exprel
live, and his countenance is mild and
jpen, he is about feve*i years of ageâ
1 hey are both very graceful, perfe&ly
:orreft i;i their manners, ai, 1 appear ex
tremejy well bred.
The cavalry uirder Colonel Floyd have
marched to a lituation about fcui teen miles
From Seringapatam, on the road leading tc
Outra Droug. It is said that the Bom
bay army will macch i.i a few days to
wards the Ghauts, and it is expected that
the grand army wir! not remain mud:
longer at Seringapa'am, asTippoo has fs.nl
urciers to hi* different Killedais, in con
formity to the terms of the treaty, to de
li vei up the forts in their pofTcfiion to tin
iroi>ps of the allies.
'lire, importance of the poll which gen
cral Meadows carried on the night of tht
s;h and 7th ultimo, app' ar from a variety
:)l circumstances. Two thousand infantry
and fifteen hundred cavalry, under the
rommand of Sain A meed, an officer next
in rank to Commor O'din Khan, were af
figncd for its defence.
A Glacis, two ditches, with seven guru
within, and three without, formed tht
llrength of the Dui /aw redoubt, which
was reinforced the evening of the alfault
with h-illy's corps.
When Ti])poo committed this strong
hold to a cholen body of men, hi;, char/e
to them seemed to imptels 011 their minds
the idea, that the event of the war and bit
own fate mull depend upon their powers.
The disposition was ably made on his
part, nor did they, whom he had fele&ed
for this important service, betiay their
'.iuft or ful in the execution of their duty.
Ourgal'ant general made. the firlt onset
wiih a vehemence and rapidity, which
were irrefutable. The outworks and entry
were at once carried, and the commander
.'.aid Aumeed fell on the spot, proving by
his exertions his fidelity to his maffer.
The a11..,1it was carried forward with e
qu::l spirit and resolution to the center ol
tlie works which was full of the enemy't
btl* .oops, who tinned one of their guns
upon tne Gorge, and with much execu
tin:) fir d grape and truilket shot upon the
aflfa mte, t!:o' thrice repulsed by superior
numbers, and a heavy fire from the imiy
Gorge > yet none of our men ever quilled
thj iraverfe of the Gorge, or repafled the
little gateway by which they entered.
At a critical period, Major Dirom
threw himfelf into the foremolt ranks ;
encouraged and rallied the men ; and a
lorig.with Captain Wight led tnein on a
Â»tw to the charge. When the Major ad
vanced oppolite to the Gorge, Captain
Gage on the right, and Cap ain Wight on
the left, took poflefiion, each of them of a
i.anqtietie, whence they fired into tlie le
douh't, v\i;h gira. effect.
M :for Dirom was knocked down, lieut,
R.ol'e'i tfoi) of his maj-ffy'3 76th regiment,
ji) t.!, right hand killeu; Kent. R. Camp
bcl of the 36th, on his left feverelv
wounded, and many of the brave soldiers
fell (Mi every fide.
Happily Dirom soon recovered himfelf,
aid Wight, who was ready to have taken
his place, relumed his poll on the ban
queue, whi.il the Major once more fuc
jeeded in rallying the men, and' iio sooner
returned to the aflault, than the enemy af
faile 1 on every hand, broke gave way, and
molt u.* tliem leaping over the embrafu'res
into the ditch, left us in pofTeffion of this
important redoubt.
Tippoo has in part fulfilled the terms of
the recent treaty of peuc., not only in the
delivery of his two sons as hostages, but
jlfo in a partial payment, of the fu.n Itipu
lated in the treaty to be paid by him.
On the second i nit ant, one Crore and
thirty Tacks of Rupee) were ferit out of
the garrif.n to h-ad-qi-arters, which his
!oidfinp directed Hoare, paymaster of the
army, to take charge of.
Ou centintln continue at our polls, a
bout five hundred yards from the wall of
Seringapatam, and not more than five yards
from his, who are gene ally mounted at the
time our's are, and with great regularity.
_ AU LA CHAPF.LLE, June r 4 .
The friends of the French revolution in
this country have some hope that a change
I'.ivorable to its interests will take place in
the court of Berlin. This hope is founded
on t wo incidents âthe firlt, the march of the
Ruffian troops into Poland ) the other, the
iaiincerity of the Prussian court, which at
firft appeared more earnest in the quarrel
of Austria tiian at present.
J he greatell part of the Prussian army i ,
however, at this time in motion, The Duke
of ljrunfvvick, who is. commander .n chief,
will repair to Coblentz, where every tlitllg
is prepared for his reception, at the lateit
011 the 2d ot July. The combined armies,
it io expected, will be ready to act by the
end of tliat mouth.

ADDRESS OF THE
KING OF POLAND
To the ARMY.
"By virtue of the constitution, enaÂ£ted
22d March, 1792, the supreme and general
command of all the forces of the republic
1; e:itru!ted to u 1 in the foliowing terms â
[Here the aElofLtgijlalurt is recited): Thus is
the defence of our dear country confided to
Us and to You. The enemy that invades
it is well known to every Polauder. So
nany injuries, misfortunes, and humilia
tions heaped upon us by Ruflia, call to God
ind your courage for vengeance. The war
is no sooner declared than begun, without
:he least justifiable motive. Some degene
rate Pole-, rebels to their country, have lent
1 pretext- for it. They wish, with foreign
aid, to restore the ancient anarchy, fubjec
ion, and infiguificance, which your King at
.he head of a virtuous Diet, has luckilv ba
nished from the Poliih territories. Brave
:ountryme:i 1 we are now called upon to
111 tinrain our polTeflious, our honor, and
:>ur libertiesâto defend our brethren, to
revenge so many wrong"-, which we and otir
forefather; ha s fuifc red, and to protect the
lionor of your K.ng. who consecrates, with
plsafure and finctrity, the remnant of his
->ld age to liis country. The nation longed
to have a respectable army, but anarchy and
foreign influence always opposed it ; at hilt,
ay chearful offers, it is railed to have in you
ts defenders, the improvement of whose
:ondition was not-forgotten by the present
vovernment. It was proper to add regu
larity and discipline common and necessary
,11 all armies, to the courage of Poles, which
though they may seem tleW to you, are not
:he lei's re iii lite for the Strength, order and
;!ory of the army. To execute those re
gulations lhall be the duty of your com
mander, and to obey them, ought to be
iour ambitionâwe ali mult obey the laws,
and you those who execute them. The
irmy we have opposed to us, owes its
trengtti to a blind obedience and fubmif
iion to orders. Endeavour to surpass it e
ren in th , and then neither its numbers,
lor its bravery, will be able to intimidate
he Poles. It is true Ruffian troops have
ieen accustomed to delpife the Poli!-h fol
liers, but you have now an open field to
ileferve a more honorable opinion in fu
ture. Your country, for whose inde
>t ndence we are going to fight, your King,
â a hole Heps are directed by jtiHice, (hall
..due and reward your merit and valor â
fÂ«u may be fnre of bÂ«ing amply repaid for
he hazard of your lives, by the gratitude
)!'your countrymen, by the acquilit'ron o!
;iory, and by the hands of your King.
Therefore, as your King and your com
nander, she recommends to you molt ear
lelilv to unite good conduit to obedience â
'ortitude to courage âand love of your
.ountry to loyalty.
We recommend to the commanding offi
cers vigilance and attention, exemplary
temperance and courage, vigor and justice
on every occalion.
The army of a free nation, thus qualified
w -tli a good cause 011 their fide, cannot fail
to find their support ill the powerful arm of
the Omnipotent. You serve for honorâ
let it be your guide : the honor of a Polish
o'.dier is of the highelt importance, because
it is a pledge of the allegiance to his coun
try, to which he owes all.
Do not faSfer a traitor among you (Should
any unfortunately be found) and the fafety
of your country will be) our own work.
In every danger remember and think of
your dear country ; our life is the leaf!
tiling that we can offer her. Your com
mon father, your King, and your comman
der, gives you forever this word of com
mand âChildren ! Let us either live free and lef
pecled, or die With honcr. Given at \VarUw,

We hear, with great pleasure, that the
sugar maple lands in New-York and Penn
sylvania, have attracted the attention of
European and American settlers ot ail ranks
and descriptions. A number of French fa
milies, of ample resources for improving
the country, are about to fettle ou ihe eall
branch of the Sufquehannah- A manufac
tory of sugar and potalh, in the hands 01 a
number of citizens of Philadelphia, is aboil.
to be eftabliflied on a rich body of !ugar
maple land oif tile Delaware- In short, it
would fccm, from the paflion that hits late
ly appeared for that species of land, that
the whole of the sugar maple country will,
in a few years, vie in cultivation and wealth
with the oldest and richest counties in New-
York and Pennsylvania. An acrÂ« of the
maple lanJ, in Nirthumberlaiid county,
Which was of the firlt quality, yiekled, in
one year, nine and thirty bulhels of wheat ;
and an acre of that which was of the low
est quality in Northumberland county,
yielded tuxnt) bulhels ot the fame grain, in
' one year.

fays, "I have the honor to encioft ay ab

oft by tile prejtnt government."âThis mode
of expreflion would lead one to imagii>

" The lumps of hail, that I examined, were of

eompofed of as many as eight or nine lesser Hones,
congealed firmly together in one lump ; th.fe
lesser parts were of different forms, some of the
least were circular, no more tlian a Uiird of an
inch diameter, yet these were of the spheroid
kind, happening lo by their exposed parts lultjin

lineated by the fingers of nature ; others of the
prismatic, some cylindric, and some conic, and in
the components of each lump, all the iorme re

When, proceeding upon grounds so loose
.tnd uujufl, Mercaror males the extraordi
nary declaration, that ;he secretary of the
treasury " h'. produced all actual addition to
the public debt ol more than one million
md a half of dollars," is it not palpab e,

fair the mean-;, a - one link in the chain of

the language ani conception? of lAercatbr, to
'jro''idc for a debt, and to u product 1 it, amount
to the fan e thimr ? .
To form a 1111 l better estimate of the spi
rit by which lie is actuated, let there be a
review of foitie leading facts.
Congress met under the present govern
ment 011 th" 'irlt of April, 1789 To put it
in motion they had a valt s>itl very arduous
work before them. This was ol courle a
primary object a provision v or the deot
a fecondarv one. It was ( natural then that
the si 'ft feflion (hould have been exhausted
in organizing the government, and that a
fyfteifMtic provision for the debt (hould be
postponed, as in fact it was, to the fecojid
ftjlflon. A temporary and partial provision of
rev< nue or:i 1 made, by very
moderate dutie of import, far ihort of an
ul annate fund for the iupport of govern
. ; it and the payment of the interest 011
1? debt, to take effett 011 the firft of Au
gust, i~Bq ; which wis as early as the law
could be promulgated tnroughout the uni
.l i, and the Subordinate executive arrange
in â tit-: made for carrying it into execution.
It has been Hated, that the treasury de
partment began to be in activity on the
i 3th of September. Congress adjourned on
;â  It. tn of that month, after having 111-
' rrucled the secretary of the treasury to re
port concerning the "debt at tkt enjuingJcJJion.
t is to be recollected that without an or
der of the house that officer can propose
nothing.
'Tis evident then, that there was no rel
oonlibility on the fide of that department,
f: ,!â  the ac'cumillation of interest on the den;
until at earliest the second fellidn, which be
Â»an on the - th of January, i"9Â°.
' On Thursday, the 14th of January, the
secretary of rhe treasury submitted to the
fotife of Representatives, according to or
t!ic plan of a provision for the public
debt, comprehending an additional provi
sion of revenue for the purpose o. facing
the interest. P>fTt it was not till the 4th of
Au;<;u<i,that the principles of a provision for
the debt were determined by law, nor till
the 10th of the fame month, that a kipple
nentary fund was eftabliihed for paying the
ntereft upon it ; and from conuderations
as an obvious nature, the commencement
if this fund in operation was deferred to
he firft of Jatfnarv following
Here again 'tis manifeft. that there was
30 refpor.fibility in the treasury department,
for the accumulation of interest up to the
K'riod from which it has been punctually
â  .id, namely, the firft of January, 1791;
jeeaufe it was not in the power of that de
xirtmentto have accelerated a provilion for
t. Nor will any blame justly light upon
C.Ticrets for the moderate delay which en
'u -i It was their duty to bestow much
ieliberation upon the fubiecf Much diaer
â¢nee of opinion, much lengthy discus. on, a
.onfiderab' loss of time, were to be ex
vtled in relation to a fubjeft so niomea
rou , so p. rplexiug, touching so differently
j in-.ay chbi of paflion and interest.
The law providing for the debt having
priui'dâtlv secretary of the treafurv imme
' |i-rc 1 v fei/!ed the opportunity which was
â  .'"ordecl, by an Unappropriated furplfts of
ev.aue to the end of the year 1790, to
nake an imprellion 011 the debt. He pro
oole'd that it fiiou'd be app.r d to purcha
j:â  of the debt, at its market prices which
..as agreed to by Oongrefs, and has b en
carried into execution asfsr as circui.iftati
ce have hitherto permitted.
This was certainly the best application
that could have been made of the fflflld. It
C -a -Sly the micreft of the go- er.iment
and of the public creditors :-Of the go
vernment, because it w.as a clear gain oi a.l
the dirte.-cnce bet-.veen the sum of fpocie
paid and the sum of debt redeemed, which
is ahâady 514,801 dollars raid (.9 cents, and
,11 be more when the remaining sum a;-
o.'on, iared comes to be applied to further
uireha es ; because it wa) a clear favmg to
[IIL . .-on of all the difference in price
which wa- p -id by foreign.' r- in their pur
chase, in confsquence of the competition
oi the goverhmeut, in the market, as a pur-
chafer. It is well known to every vteij
informed man, that the rapid
of the debt was materially owing to that
ircumftance, and of course the fa/ving td
;he nation by it has been Very conjidcrable. â
The measure in question was equally bene
ric.al to the public creditorsâ because it the
fund applied to purchases had bee,n appor
tioned among them in payment of intereif,
it would have been a mere pittance ; buc
applied as it was, it gave a rapid spring td
the (whole value of their (lock.
As it is therefore proved; that the treasu
ry department is chargeable with no delay
with regard toap'rovilion for the debt, oc
casioning an unnecessary accumulation 6f
iutereft ; in a question of merit, refpefting
that department, which Mercator has raited,

pilrchales of the public debt at the market pri
ces
ad. For all that has been saved to tne nau
on for the more advanced prices given by tb
reignersin their purchases of the debt.
But there are other items of importance to be
placed on the fame iide of the account.
lft.The saving re lulling from the reduced rate
on the new loans mauo for paying oft the fo
reign debt .
2d. The positive gain of 1,c00,0000f dol
l.H'S by the milltution of ihc Baiik ofr the United
States. The fluck of the Bank bring at an ad
vance of 50 pet' cent, it is clear, that the govern
ment, by having become a proprietor to the ex
tentof 2,c00, 000 of dollars, has by this fmgle o
peration made an aÂ£lual nett p>olic of t,cco,ocd
of dollars; that is, it can get three millions foe
what will have colt it only two. _ .
I add nothing for any saving, which has ac
ctued from the paiticulai modification of the
(iumellic debt, for two rea(ons;"one because the
lubjeft being more complicated would require
moie illustration, and the other because the
plan adopted by the legiflatuie, though having
the leading features Â«i that proposed by the
Treasury Department, differs from it in fame
material refpeefs ; a flrong relutation df the !^ca Â«.
so indull 1 ioufly inculcatcd, that the plans of
that depaitment are implicitly followed by the
legiflatuie; aiid a decilive proof, that (hey have
had no more weight than they to have
had, that is to fay than they weie intitled to*
from their inttinfic realoiiahlencls in the unbi I
fed and independent judgment of rryijonties jn
the two houles of Congicls. The lefult of
what has been said is thisâthat proViGon was
made for paying jhe interest of the debt as eaily
as could 1 cafenably have beer. c;:p-:t.dâthat no
negligence having happened, the arrears of mte
-1 ell which accumulated in the interval are pio
peily a part of the debts of the former govcni
luent and co'.tfcquciltly that the funis which'
appear to have been abioibed are lo much thw
Jc bis of the Government cxiiu o uilhed by the
new. , , .
Mercator brings as a proof, that the pubjtc
ilebt has increaled and is increalin;', "what he
ermS the present amount .md encreajing weight
of the duties ol impoll aftd excile.*' Let facts de
idc the soundness of this logicâln the lall fel
rion of Congress, the only excise duty which ex-
Ds, was reduced upon an average fifteen per
rent. The only addition which w is then made to
he impolls was for carrying on the Indian War,
ind bv avoiding recouife to permanent loans lor
hat purpofc, to avoid an incrtafe of the debt.
How then can that, which was done to avoid an
ncreafe of debt, be a proof f hat it has inerea/'cd?

Mr. ADAMS,
WHEN the funding system was undercon
fideration in Congress, and the patriotic
M ADISON, and others'\iv%e& the propriety of a
difct imi nation )â  \n order to do jullice to the ori
ginal public creditors, some of thole opposed to a
discrimination, declared, that if any application
was brought forward, by the late army for a com
pensation for their services, none would be more
ready than they to support it j and this was
only the language of foroc in, but also of many
out of Congress ; who from their interested situa
tion, might probably be opposed to a discrimina
tion ; than which, no measure could have been
more just and righteous.
It is unneceflary to recapitulate the solemn sti
pulations and promiffs of the government to theii
army, or their acknowledgement of the faithful
nefs of that army, thele will remain on re-
Cord, as long as the archieves of our country
Oiall endure. Nor is it neceflary to repeat that i
large proportion of the evidences of the dues o]
the soldier, were transferred to speculators, for a
few {hillings on the pound, becaule the govern
ment negle&ed to provide funds, for their propel
security : And that the property so acquired b}
Peculators, multiplied by a gain of from five tc
nin- hundred per cent, profit, by the funding
system % has enabled the prefeut polfrfTors to figun
away in the fundi and banks, in public lands t anc
in a va-iety of other Jpeculations, to a latitude sur
prising, even to themselves. But where arc thoJ\
men, who earned this property, at the peril of thei
livesâand have never yet received an adequat<
consideration therefor, either from the public, o
from those who are enjoying of it ? Their har<
earned dues, in mÂ«ny instances, they were-com
pelled to dispose of far a trifle, to save themfelvc
and their families from flarving. What remain
ed in their hands, at the time of funding, by tba
fyjiem, has a third part suspended from interest
lor ten years ; and a further injury is done thenr
by not paying them at the time of funding, bu
funding furh interest at three per cent.âThi
was murk more tkan enough, for those who ha<
purchased certificates at 2/6 on the pound. Bu
to the original creditors, it was not only a real in
jury, but repugnant to the solemnly tiipulate<
agreement made with them by government.
The members of the late army are now com
ing forward with memorials to Congress, in orde
to obtain that justice which has been solemnly
and repeatedly promised to them ;, and which the;
feel confident their country, will never allow to b<
withheld from them. Jf upon investigation, i
/hould appear that compensation, fully ecjual t<
the lofTes they have sustained, thro' the negled
of the government, cannot be -madd, without in
volving the community in much difficultyâcat
any honed man lay his harjd upon his heart am
lay, that one third part of their dues can upor
any principle of justice or equity, be fufpende;
frcm interest for term of ten years 5 or tha
they not to receive the interest that wai
due to them to the time of funding ? The plac.
ing this third part on interest, and payment of the
other reservation, will not add a single farthing
to the public debt, solemnly contracted, and just
Jy due 5 and it is presumed, that a wife and virtu
ous republic, will never wish to make a saving t<
itfelf, drt the expence of the original public credi
torsâand fiom them alone, whose services an<
loans have been acknowledged in the most exalt'
ed ftrainsthat language can paint them.
I do not pretend to fay, that this would be con
fidered as a just compensation, by the fufferer
themselves, but I will venture to fay, as a mem
ber of the community, and as one bound to paj
my proportion of the public debt, wherever it i
found to be juitly due, that if such a meafuri
would give fatisfa&ion, honor and justice, as wel
as found policy and good faith, unite in favor o
its beingdone $ and that so seasonably, as to in
sure its being done with some grace.
There aie some who are already objefli
ans to the making compensation to the army, bÂ«
suggesting that luch a measure would open a vvidi
field j that others have as good claims to justice ,
and that if the door be once opened, they wil
come forward, &we (hall not know where to stop
This to be sure, is a very plausible objection, bu
can never have any great weight with those, whe
arejuft and honest, and mean to paj their jus
debts. If the public is as fairly, and by as folcmr
contracts j (yet unfulfilled) indebted to others, a:
to the late arm}, they are in duty bound to pa)
them : But this is no obje&ion to the wel
founded claims of the army. And where can the
public with more propriety, begin to do justice,
than with those with whom they have so solemn
ly ftipuhte,d 5 and who have through the ncg.
led of the government, loft so large a propor
tion of the : r just dues ? which lodes, by the fund
ing system, have been fandtioaed, to the aggran
dizement of a few j while the many loofers of th<
fame property, are fubjeSed to pay in duties or
the necefl'aries of life which they coufume, a pari
of the fruits of their daily industry, to ensure the
payment of the interest quarterly, on an unrea
sonable gain.
If this meritorious class of men, are to be lefl
if. this siTuation, without compeiif.nion, in some
way or other, for their services and lofTes in the
public service, can any man rationally expect
that peace and prosperity can long beam in oui
land. Square, if'you can, ye champions of mo
dem justice and policy, things so unequal with im
mutable right, or with that constitution whicl
among other things, has been reared expressly /<
