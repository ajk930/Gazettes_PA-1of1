DEFENCE
Of Mr. Jefferson's political CharaStr.
in reply to fevtral Pieces which have
appeared againjl it in the Ga

[Continued from Number 96.]
From the American Daily Advertiser,
BY the extra Â£ls from Mr. JefFerfon'i
letters lately published, his lentiments
sir. the confutation have been unbosomed
â¢ > his countrymen. The circumstances
under which they were written, already
noticed, furnifh the mofl fatisfafiory de
monflration they were the genuine diclate;
of his heart. That they became at the
time, the ftibjefl of pu'ilic difcufiion, mufl
have given him surprise; but that they
fnould now be resorted to for the purpose
cf crimination, even if his judgment, upon
that great fubjeft, had wandered ftom e
leund decision, is flill more extraordinary.
They a<-e however fully before the public,
and whether they deserve commendatior
or censure, hti fellow citizens will deter
mine for themselves.
Ift he political querist fought, as an ob
ject of curious speculation, a more conciff
Â«nd summary exposition of them, I am
persuaded he would concur with me in the
following, founded on the'e extracts
Â»' That he bad become sensible the wife
and happy direction of the afTaii s of his
country required some great change in hei
political, inftitutio'ns ( and when he firfl
saw the cor.ftitution, the result of thinfe
able and experienced councils, to whose
care the modification had been committed,
lie considered it like all other human pro
ductions, containing much good, but not
without a considerable alloy of evil. That
he prized its good qualities too high to
urge any step that might pofiibly tend to
hazard the fyltem, and therefore wished
its immediate adoption by nine Hates and
establishment as a jovernmenti That he
wished the four other dates to holdout,
and thereby form on each fide an indepen
dent head, between whom the necessary
amendments might be amicably adjusted,
Thai afterwards and for the fake of great
er lafety, confiding in the virtues and pa
triotifm of his countrymen, he even ad
vised amendments in the mode proposed ir
the instrument itfelf.*
Let the "American" shew the paiTageir
these or any other letters written by him :
whieh should give offence to the most ac
t ve republican fupporterof the conltitu
tution, in that or any fubfequcnt ltage :
which denounces him the foe to good go
vernment, the frit dos anarchy and licen
cioufnefs. Let him point out the fenti
ment which has not in a great meafurc
been verified, by the President in his in
troductory speech to Congress, the fubie
quent ads cf that bod,, and those of the
several ilates. Unhappily for mankind
the annals of all nations prove, that per
lens in his Ration tpo often err in the op
posite extreme. That those who possess
wealth and power, and even where these
gifts have been conferred by the confidence

and favour of their countrymen* are toe
apt to feel for themselves a difFtrent inte
rest, separate from, and look with an eye
of jealousy and fcom upon those of their
fellow men, to whom the goods of fortune
have been dtfpenfed with a less liberal
hand. In this refpeft indeed the tone ol
charadter displayed in these letters may be
deemed in some measure peculiar to theii
atuhon Such an unfeigned and benevo
lent regard for mankind in alf their clafies :
such an anxious folicittide for their wel
fare, and vigilant atterttion to. their rights,
are rarely to be found united in any oik
person. With feelings and sentiment;
like these, if I mistake not the man, the
felfifh, narrow, and vain-aspiring heart ol
Tb- American never glowed.'
The charge then of hoftiltty to the go
vernment in that early ftnge, so far as it
depended on the Secret operations of hi
mind, has been (hewn to be without foun
dation. His subsequent conduit has been
; raced for further evidence of difafteition, &
however light and contemptible the cir
cumftances are on which it rells, I will
pursue it, the more fully to demonllratt
the impurity of the motives which dicta
ted the attack.
The freedom with which he has spoken
of some public measures, being a principal
servant in the executive department* ha;
been relied on as a circumstance ofunequi
focal proof of fueh hollility. The object
md extent of this position, perhaps Ido
rto't fuliy comprehend : does the authoi
ifiean, that a wifely framed government
:annot in its adminiilration adopt an inju
licious and improper measure ; or that a
nan cannot be friendly to the oneand difsp
irove the other ? If this is the idea anc
he principle should be recognized, thf
Beld of enquiry upon any future occaGor
ivoiild be much abridged, and the labou:
jf all parties proportionally diminifned,
Let it 3 measures be what they might,
lowevcr repugnant to the authority under
which it acted, or f'.tbverfive of the tight:
jf those who made and for vshofe benefit
t should be adminillered, no controvcrfy
ipon t l efe points could be fuflained ; nc
critical Comparison could be made, no line
jf partition drawn between the one and
the other. If this doctrine fliould be efla-
Dlifhedj the people of these states would
ind themfehes reduced to a strange di
ernma : the constitution they had adoptee
3nd planned with so ; much cire, as the
boundary of a limited authority,-would be
:onfidered as the absolute surrender of all
ih'jir rights. By legitimating every pof
ible measure which in the progress oi
:ime a venal and unprincipled majority
might carry, its a&s would become more
spprefiive than those of any exifling ty
ranny, becatife its'adminiflration would be
more daring, uncjer the delusion pradtifed
an the people, by seeming to rell on their
fuffrage.
Or does the author mean that a person
by accepting an office in the executive
department, should lose in the spirit of the
â¢rp3, the native rights of a freeman ? that
he (hould abandon his own sentiments,
except at private consultations, and cling
:o those of the majority ? that a man of
jreat worth', in whom for pall services his
:ountrymen reposed an high confidence,
hould throw the weight of his character,
uto the scale, to support a measure which
n his conscience he disapproved and in his
lation had opposed ? that the members of
lie adminiilration fliould form together
i close and secret combination, into whose
neafures the profane eye of the public
hould in no inflance pry ? If this is
lis idea, Itt it be avowed ; it involves
i principle which upon public confider
itions should be difcufTed ; for I con
ider itfubverfive of those upon vhich the
government ltfelf was founded. The mask
as fccrccy adopted in arbitrary govern
ments, for the mod oppreflive purposes,
and which by some good men has been
deemed necessary to cover executive ope
rations, has ia moll instances when ap
plied to us bfen over-rated. Few cases
only, and those purely executive, and for
which the chieftain himfelf should be held
responsible, can require it. In general, if
it does not cover gross and fhameful mal
versations, and which should be exposed
for vvholefome corredtion to the public
view, the most favourable light in which it
can be held, is that of an empty, frivolous,
and pageant Ceremonial of office* But it
m?j be positively affirmed, that whenever
it interferes with the spirit of refponitbility,
the life and foul of republican government,
its tendency is vicious; and fliould be aban
doned. bo far then from deeming him
:enfurablej for the freedom of his d:fcourfe
upon public measures, to the extent that 1
im persuaded he has carried it, I honor
irid refpeft him for it. It marks a firm
uid virtuous independence of chara&er,
which assures me I may still confide in
lim with fafety. The principles he ac
cucwledges> and the language he uses, are
lis own ; not formed upon those of the ma
ority of the corps to which he may occa
lonally belong: they are the fame I
snow that he possessed before he commeri
:ed the career of public trust.

M. Br is sOt's account of the permanent fit
ting of the night of the 9 </j, and day of the
loth rfugufi 179 Z.
" THE wickedness of the court was at
ts height, as was also the indignation of
the people. A grand conieft vas prepa
'ing, which was at length to terminate the
war waged by the head of the executive
Power, the nation to whom lie
* O
awed all. The people had long been
ready, and ftiade no secret of their refedu
ion ; the preparations of the cotlrt were
"hrouded in darkness.
" At midnight the found of the alarm
sell refounced in all parts, the drums beat,
ind the citizens flew to arms. On this
Ignal the national assembly met. It was
Toon informed that M. Petion, always hu
â nane, was exerting himfelf to avert the
lormâthat he was at the palaceâand
hat he was in danger there, because
wretches detained him, ar.d pretended to
;eep him as an hoftagc against the ven
geance of the people. The assembly or
dered the virtuous magistrate to the bar ;
le spoke with firmriefs of the approaching
:rifis ; with modesty of his efforts ; with
:oolr,efs of his dangers. He was applaud
ed, invited to the fitting, and then restored
to his functions
" In the mean time, if guilt was on the
watch at the palace, patriotifin was every
whereon the watch in the city. Citizens
md feftions cartic to deposit in the bosom
jf the representatives of the people, their
Solicitudes and. their sentiments. They no
onger considered the court but as the focus
as a counter revolution ; the palace of the
rhuilleries but as another Coblentz. If
:he people were firmly resolved to punifn
:heir enemies, it was because their enemies
;iad compelled them to it. If they die
lot wait for the vengeance of the law, il
was because the law is flow to punish, ant
:onfpirators prompt to ast ; it wal because
ill laws muff: be silent in the prcfence o
[he supreme lawâthe fafety of the coun
try.
"It was day : the minister of jufticc
repaired to the assembly. He came thi
ther to implore for the king that protec
tion which he could not expett frsm th<
love as the people so ofu-n betrayedâ
which lie durst not hope from their cle
mency so often rewarded by a&s of perfi
d) r . The national assembly, however, for
getting both the grievances of the natior
and their own, remembering only theii
constant generosity, thought of means tc
form a rampart for the king, of the confi
dence which they enjoyed, in place of that
which he had loft.
" During this difcufiion, municipal
officers announced that a new provisional
Numb-, ioo.
adminillratiori was formed at the com
mon hall. Ihe people assembled in their
fedtions nominated commissioners, who,
by virtue of their powers, constituted
themselves council generalof the commons.
The municipality had been suspended du

M. Danvon alone excepted. Butthe peo
ple unwilling that their beloved magittrate
[liould (hare their dangers, wilting, if Â£
may sb express it, to deposit the law nnd
Its most refpefted organ, had surrounded
Mi Petion with a numerous guard, and
sorifined him in his own house The pro*
visional administration had put M. San
terre provisionally at the head of the pub
lic force, and forbidden this force to ac
knowledge the etat major.
" The difcufiion being resumed, after
litis communication, was loon interrupted
i second time by the news of fcveral events
if which Paris was the theatre.
" The night had not been disturbed,
jut by the funeral found of the alarm bell
ind the noise of drums. A falfe patrol,
lad however been arretted, as it was re
sailing to the palace ; and in it were
ound courtiers, king's guards, and even
in abbe. Since day break, all the armed
.'itizens, the battalions of Marseilles, and
he federates of the departments, filled
he avenues of the palace and the national
iffembly- An immense multitude dem2nd
:d the punishment of the traitors appre
lended ; they had been legally interroga
ted, and nothing was wanting to their
:onviction of guilt; they were put to
leath ; and their heads borne on bloody
aikes, exhibited a striking lelfou to the
:nemies of the people, that if their patience
be long* their vengeance ia terrible. Suleau,
well known by his counter revolution li
iels, and journals, met the fame fate. He
bad been apprehended in arms, and the
jniform of a grenadier of the national
iuard, although not enrolled in it; he was
repairing to the palace.
'* Terrified by these examples, with Ut
ile confidence in the courage of his friends,
the king was come to fcek an asylum in
the tnidft of the representatives of the na
tiom He was followed by his wife, by
his children, and his filler. At firft he
took his feat by the fide of the president, â 
and afterwards withdrew to the bar with,
his family ; but by the terms of t}*e con
llitution, the assembly could not debate in
his presence, and he was made to retire to
i place ufuallv occupied by the reporters
for a newspaper. Ten commilfioners were
then nominated to go and appease the
people.
'â  The two parties were in fight of each
ither. The Swift, guards, and abundance
t>f the valets of the court, disguised as na
ional guards, occupied the palace. Diffe
rent detachments of the national guards,
:itizens armed with pikes, the Mai feillois,
the federates, were ranged in battle array
n the fqudre or the Carousel. 1 hey knew
not that the palace was filled with troops ;
hey were under apprehensions for the
lational aflembly, from the ptoximify of
this palace which was aow become a place
t>f arms ; th< y feared it might soon become
the point of rendezvous for the coun
ter revo'iutionitts, and the cradle of a civil
war. They wiflied to take pofieffion of it ;
they could not be reproached with de
liring to violate the fafetyof the king, for
they knew that he was in the national tf
fembiy. T'ie garrison of the palace cou
ftantly refufed to let them become matters,
of it, aftd liad made preparations for de
fence. The gates, however, were opened,
the firft rank of the Swiss had grounded
their arms, the reft were waving their hats
on the point of their bayonets. Some
national guards ran Up, holding out .their
hands to them, and were received by a
volley offhot. This ast of treachery ferred
only to exasperate the outrage of the pa
ti iota. A long and cruel combat ensued.
Swords glitter, canr.on thunder, and pour
forth dceth: on both fidei the fire is keptup with moll fatal activity. The Swiss han
dled their arms with more dexterity and a
finer aim ; the patriots fought with more
ardour and intrepidity. 'i'hcfe are all he
roes ; The Marfeillois are lions. At
length courage aird the better cause tri
umphed : the Swifsore broke in upon, and
a g-reat carnage puiiijhes their peilidy and
their obltinate refillance. The vidtory
cott us much blood ; about fifty patriots
fell, and a cm'-.-at number were .woÂ«Bded

A deputation from the citizens alien)bled
at the Champ de Mars, appeared at the bar
of the National Afl'embly [Aug. 6] and
were admitted. They were preceded by
a man bearing a pike, with a woolen cap,
representing the cap of liberty. In the cen

board, ufcriJjed with the uor.ls, Duckaznce
iu Hoi {Depolition of the king]â After the
writing had been taken away, by order of
the afi'embly, the orator of the deputation
was permitted to advanceâHe then spoke
as follows :
" The country is in danger : we have ac
|uired the right of speaking bold truths, and
â on will doubtless have courage enough to
hear them.
" Despotism has only changed its afpeS,
not its principles: we are betrayed; and
yotj have neither pointed out the origin of
our misfortunes, nor Tile means of prevent
ing them in fu tire.
"A perfidious court labours to deflroy
us. Its plots are d.(covered ; and French
men, now become free, will <?nter into no
accommodation with their enemies. It is
'lot the B iih!e that is mow to be overturn
ed ; it is the Caltle of the Thuilleries [Plau
dii.]
A perjured, a traitorous king, is at the
lead of government. The favorites of the
court have found means to corrupt tome of
the member > of this afi'embly ; conspirators
are scattered over all the kingdom ; and as
yet the law has not smote a (ingle culprit.
" The people are become indignant ; and
they declare to you, through'me, that they
have rejourned the vengeance to which
.hey are entitled, by the law of nature, on
ly, in order to commit its execution to the
laws of society.
"Vie demand reparation in behalf of
he nation, whose sovereignty has been bar
tered away. If the decrees of the conlli.
tneat bodyafter the the 2 ift ofjune, 1792,
are examined, any one will be tempted to
krgue their utility. The fovereigity may
well t 'ciajin the laws which it hath not
enacted.
" As the ancients at certain awful peri
ods threw a veil over the llatues of the
jjods, we demand that you mayalfovel
the Rights ot Man ; that you cause an ac
count to be tip of all the crimes com
"inted in the king's name ; that Louis XVI
may be decreed to have abdicated the roy
alty ; and that primary afiemblies may be
convoked, in order to form a national con
vention, to which every citizen who can
prove his relidence and payment of impolls,
fliall be admitted.
" We further require, that all the gene
ral officers of the army may be reformed ;
that La Fayette be put in a lhue of accu
sation; that the levies of troops be aug
mented ; that the patriotic miniilers be re
flacedjthat the executive power be confined

The king of Piutfia, more gallant than his

To the Editor of the National Gazette.
sir,
AS there are many devoted to opinions
for no other reason but becaule fa-
fhionable, so there are some no less fond of
whatever is Angular and unfafhionable. â
Whether this lalf weakness be mine, and if
so, to be accounted for by the peeyifhnefs
of old age, the caprice of a particular tem
per, or an obstinacy in adhering to wrong
idea, taken up at hazard, or in any more
probable way or manner, I fliall leave to be
fettled by other?. Butfo it i-s, Mr. Editor,
that notwithstanding all the reafoniug, rail
ing, and flourifcing we have had against the
following opinioni, I cannot, for my life,
bring myfelf to flrike out a finale one oi
lliem from my present political creed
/believe, that a man may, in very deed, he
a sincere friend to the government as laid
down in the conftttution ; and an enemy tc
principles on which the government is car
ried into practice ; as also, that a man may
be a dccidcd enemy in his heart to the re
publican principles of the conflitution, ant
a zealous friend withal to meafnres and ob
jects purtued by the government.
I believe that a charge on the policy of
the government as favourable to luxury,
which is the fruit of wealth, is in no wife
inconliftent with another charge thereon
of not pursuing the real and general inter
est and prosperity of the country. For, the
Ivealth that produces mod luxury is thai
which isunreafonably thrown into the hand,
of a few, to the impoverifhmcnl of the many ;
whereas the true prosperity of a country
conlifts in the grealejl practicable dijfufion of thi
lawful gratifications of life, througn the great
body of the foeiety. There never was t
country where fuperfluity and luxury were
enjoyed by the generality of the people ;
nnlefs among the Romans, who lived 01;
the plunder of the whole world. This i:
not only, in ordinary, impollible, but the
tendency of things is quite tlu- contrary
way, namely, to heap upfuperfluous wealth
qn a fin all part of the foeiety. made lip oi
the comforts of life abflrafted from the ge
iÂ»erality. In so far as this tendency (tvliict

a republican one as ours, then evtrygoo;
citizen Should berth' hinifelf to remedy the
evil.
I believe that a system may be nothing
more in the gross than a copy or imitation
and yet may contain therein particular novel
ties ; and also, that a fcrvile imitation oi
monarchical meafnres may be proper!)
deemed, held, and called a new-l'angled po
licy in a republican government.
I believe that as it is plain the meaftire
sf the government have obferred and con
formed to neither the substance of public
juflice, nor the ftriflnefs of public faith,
that those who profefs to be warm friend;
to the one or the other, and yet launch
forth into universal and unqualified praifc
on the measures of the government, arc
more likely to be gainers bv such measures,
than to be sincere in fa : d profelfions-
I believe it to be more probable that the
guilty (liquid deny the truth, than that ew
senses flioukl deceive us; consequently, when
Jjte outward signs of wealth, and the visi
ble ftibfcriptions of large funis to the fund
and the bank are observed in a number o!
Our rulers, who, I fore the year 1789, were
Uotoriqijfly destitute of such wealth, that s
denial of the faÂ£t is no proof of their 1101
having enriched themselves out of theii
own plans, proceedings, and measures.
I believe, that if the mal-prafiices char
ged on our rulers were well founded, th<
gu Ity actors and partners therein wotilc
naturally endeavour to turn oif the atten
tiqn of the people therefrom, by the vert
means now praÂ£tifed, to calumniate theii

Samuel Smith, Esq. is el. fted a repre
Tentative In Congress for the state of Ma
ryland, for the diftrift of the town and
county of Baltimore.
How unlucky it is that Congress did
not let federal years run on after the col
lection of revenue began, before the pay
ment of intereit on the debt was to be
made. The intereit for the whole delay
would then have been consolidated into
the principal, the a-rears of revenue would
have increased some millions ; and being
applied to difchaKge the consolidated interefl,
might have been pompously held out to
the public as a reduilion of the principal of
the debt.âWhat a pity, likewise, that the
money appropriated as a finking fund to
reduce the debt, had not been used at such
times and in such manneras to buy up the
debt at the lotuefl rate to be had, instead of
being dealt away at the highcjl rata going ;
or speaking more truly, in the bighefl lids
at cr.cc : hot the law woul 1 allow. There
woula have been better ground then to
talk of a fvving spirit in lie public manage
ment : nd the approving voice of a re
lieved pe.iple might come in the
piace of the clcpi and acclamations which
he -action room resounded with from the
pampered gamb'ers 111 the public funds.
On "I ue "day last wa3 held at the llate
house in this city, the election of numbers
of the state legidature, and representatives

that attended 011 the occasion was very

whici. appeared on this occalion, the elec

duce the legislature to take some step to

TThe following letter from an officer in
8 Lord Cornwallis's army, in the ha(t-In
t dies, represents the motives ofÃvitaisfor
a making a peace in that country, in a very
I different light from those accounts which
have appeared in the minifteria'i prints.]
3 Extract of a Utter from an officer vn the 7 \JI regi
mint, dated Camp near Seringapatam, Fcbru
]' ary 24, 1792.
it "The whole army is amazed and deject
ed at this extraordinary peace j even the
y countenance of the comnr.Ynder in chief can
' r not conceal his difappoinUnent. Itiswhif
j pered that he has received positive order:
from England to put a period to holtilitie
on any terms ; and indeed we cannot all)
other way account fop so unexpetted a niea
it fore.
" Our victory of the 6rh inft. was very
:learly earned ; eleven officers were killed,
Â»n<J a proportionate number of privates,
rhere was particularly a great carnage in
:he right wing, commanded by Gen. Mea
iows.
"From that specimen of the difctpline
md courage of the enemy, we (hcruld cer
:ainly have found much more difficulty in
a king Seringapatam than has hitherto been
njagincd. But there scarcely is one man
n the army who does not firmly believe
:hat we would have taken it, although at
he expence of much blood. The place is
'ortified with wonderful art, and is one of
he strongest iu India ; but there never was
uch an army as ours in India before ; the
>fficers and men are all zealous in the
:aufe, and they look upon themselves as
nvincible.
"The country powers, our allies, inltead
>f afiifting us, have been like a miH-ftone
ibout our neck. They make a scarcity of
trovifion;, ?md boast of their courage; yet
hey are always absent in danger, and fore
110ft in the moment of viflory, which they
hen pretend is obtained by them. Capt.
little's victory is a flrong inllance of this,
n (hort, they refute to do any thing, but
hare the plunder ; and the articles of the
leace are made entirely to please them.
They will have all ; for as to the territory
eded to the company, it will cost more to
:eep and protest it than it is worth ; and
s to the mare of money which will be di
ided, it will not enable Lord Cornwallis
0 keep his word, of making the officers
nd men some compenfatioil for not plun
lering Seringapatam, much less to reim
mrfe the company.
" We are mostly of opinion, that it would
ave been better for the company to have
aken nothing at all, than territory which
nuft incur more expence than it is worth,
nd a promise of money which will never
e paid, for none of us place 10 much faith
11 Tippoo as to think he will keep his wo-d.
Veal! believe that his design is to tiiie
vith us until the monsoons set in, in order
hat they may oblige us to do what he can
otâretire.
" Ail my brethren of the blade, as well
s myfelf, will be great losers by this war.
Vhen I return to Madras I shall just be
iree hundred pounds worse than when I
left it. Lord Cornwallis, whom we all
efpect, is very feniible of this, and there
jre proposes dividing a part of the money
1 be paid by Tippoo, among us ; but as
te do not expect any of that money will
ver be paid, we place 110 dependence oil
ur pfomifed shares.
It is laid, that the inftruflions sent frornt
ngland to Lord Cornwallis, commanded
im to make peacc on any terms, and that
' there is an opportunity for liim to make
uy kind of peace after receiving them, and
e does not embrace that opportunity, he
mft be answerable for the ccnfequences.
"his rs what we believe has deterred his
>rd!hip from attempting to cake Seringa
atam, as there is a poffib l;ty that iie
light have been unfnccefsful. We are all
onvincetl of his lordthip's ardor and brave
y, and we believe he will equally acknow
â dge ours.
Such is the effect of this peace upon our
'oops, that we (hall leave the Myforeroore
ifpiriced than if we had been defeated, and
riven out of it. Many of my brother of
cers declare, that it would have been bet
:r for them they had died under the walls
f Seriiigapatani, than to turn to their dif
;rent peace elfabiiftimeuts deeply in debt,
nd without a profpeft of paying it."

SMIT by the glance of thy bright eyes
When I, Marcella, fondly gaze,
Strange feelings in my bosom rife
And piflion all my reason sways :
Worlds 1 would banish from my view
And quit the god*âto talk with you.
The smile th?t decks your fading cheek
To me a heavy heart declares 5
When you are silent I would speak
But cowardice alarms my fears :
All must be sense, that you do prize.
All that-I fay, be grave and wife.
"When wandering in the evening /hade
1 (har'd her pains and felt her grief,
A thousand tender things I said
Bat she would grant me no relief;
When f'om her hair 1 brulh'd the dew
She li^h'dâand said, tii not for you !
When drooping, dull, and almost dead
WÂ»th fevers brought from sultry climes.
She would not hold my fainting head,
But recommended me some rhymes
On patiewce and on fortitude,
Aud other things, less understood.
When aiming to engage her heart
With verses from the muses' stock,
She fate, regardless of my art,
And counted seconds by the clock :
" And thus (lhe cry'dj shall verse decay
And thus the world shall pass away."
When languishing upon her bed,
(No longer fond of India gowns)
I cameâand while the patfon read
Of chryft'al skies and coral crowns,
She bade me at a distance Hand
And lean'd her head upon her hand.
So drooping hangs the fading rose
When fumfiner fends the driving shower,
So to the grave Marcella goes
Her whole duration but ar hour :
Who (hall oppose the fad decree
Or what, fair maid, recover th.Â»e ?
Such virtue in that ff/irit dwells,
Such fortitude amid such pain-
That now with pride my bosom fwelli
To think I have not liv'd in vain j
Since, flighting all the sages knew,
1 learn philosophy from you.
Ctnfideratiom on cjlablijhing a College far Old
Maids,
[Continued from our paper No. 97.]
Por the immediate government of such an insti
tution, I would recommend the following con
cifc code of ccnftitutional laws : â
THE patronage to be vested in a committee of
twelve ladits, felcfted by Parliament frora the
principal nobil'Â»t> of the kingdom ; and the power,
of nominating the treasurer, fecretarv, and other
ofiift ts, to be lodged in their bancs.
The name of each candidate, with her place of
abode and connexions, to be delivered in writing
and propeily vouched, to the committee ; and a
month to be allowed to consider r.er claim.
N j cino 10 be admitted without the writ
ten 01. jr of, at! ;cait, fix of the committee.
Eacii candidate to deposit two hundred pounds
in the han, s of the freafurer on admiifion j and:
at the fame time, a i'olemn promise of a i
Arid observance ess rules of the col- â 
legeâbinding herfd:>o pay a ftipuiated fine fo> '
each offence againtt chdfe rules, or patiently sub- j
niit to expulsion.
No lady to apply for admilTion, whose
js not irreproachable, and who has not reached the j
fortieth year of her a^e.
The me-nbers to be at liberty to withdraw!
whenever they may deem it agreeable or ex.edi- ,
enc j for it is not intended that these celebrated
words of the Italian poet should be inferibed over j
the portal: <Laciatt ogn'i fperanxa, vo'i cbe'ntrate. y I
Leave hope behind, ye girls ibat enter here !
With refpeft to the oomeftic police of the col
lege, 1 will only offer a few hints ; to form a pro
per code of rules must be left to the wisdom of the
committee.
A principal or prioress fliould be eledled annu
ally by the committee, from the sisterhood, and
Implicit obedience 10 her orders be required from
iach member 5 an appeal, however, to be open
against her before the committee, in cafe of an
abuse of power.
A feleit committee of fix to be chosen from the
sisterhood by the gatronefles, to afiift the prioress,
and to audit accounts of the college.
The whole sisterhood to breakfait and dine in
common in the refedtory, except when incapacit
ated by age or ficknels from quitting their apart
ments.
Neither evening tea nor supper to be considered
as eftablifhsd meals.
A salary to be allowed the nearest clergyman of
the established church, for officiating every Sun
day and /eftival day in the chapel of the college.
the evening and the morning femce to be
read in the chapel every other day, by one of the
sisterhood.
Besides a butler, porter, cook and the feverai
offices of the kitchen, tiiere (hould be a certain
number of chambermaids} and this number to be
3n the proportion of one maid to three members.
Each member, however, to be allowed a maid to
attend on her own person, on the condition of her
coutributing 10/. annually to the funds
To encreale the comforts of the institution, and
to give the sisterhood an opportunity of enjoying
that degree of exertife which is indispensably nr
cefi'ary for the preservation of health, a number ci
Jiorfes and carriages fliould be provided, according
to the ability of the funds, and rclolution of the
committee, together with the necefiary attend
ants.
A certain proportion of the annual income, 01
a fubfeription railed amongst the members, to be
appropriated each year, for the purchafc of books
for the libraiy j butnobooksto.be u Â« haled or
feceived as donations, without the approbation of
the domcilic committee* ]
No visitors to be received before nine o'clock in
the morning, or after three o'clock in the after
noon j nor before fix o'clock in the evening, or
after nine o'clock at nighr. The gates to be
closed at ten o'clock precisely every night, and the
&eys to be deposited with the Prioress.
in defining the building it ihould' be observed,
r hat there ought to be a number of parlours pro
portionate to the number of bed chambers j also,
a music room, and a common fitting-room. Tins
room should be of considerable extent, fitted
up for the library.
An institution thus constituted, besides meeting
the proposed object, must be prodadlive of many
other advantages Here declining age might find
a foft pillow whereon to relt her head. Here un
prote<fled females might pass down the stream of
life without apprehension Â©1" awaiting dangers.
Here, in the absence of care, and the fiience of
solitude, fancy might produce bright ettufions,
and valuable accefiions be occasionally made to the
stock of polite literature : tor within this pale of
f emale virtuej a Carter; a Montague; a Moore j a
Williams; a Brooke: or a Seward â (all old maids)
might arise. And here the arts of elegant ingenu
ity might be cultivated with fafety and iuccels.
But these are not the only advantages that would
result from such an institution. It would afford a
sure and comfortable asylum for those Old Maids,
whole lender stipend should be reduced to afcanty
pittance by the redaction of the national interest,
whenever parliament fball deem such a measure
expedient And, further, by opening a rich,
though distant protpeft of fubhuoary haprinefs to
f the 1 Voting fecnale, it would serve, in some degree,
; to defeat the dark arts of base seducers j and an
old age of neglect would no longer, by its visiona
ry terrors, precipitate the timorous virgin into the
indifloluble bands of matrimony.
But though 1 have thus briefly, and I trust,
clearly ftiown the many benefits which mull result
from the instituting a college for old maids,
1 have not the vanity to think that my feeble
voice, iftVing from the lhades of obfeurity, will
be honoured with the attention of mv country
men. 1 ftiall not then solicit it further. But 1
entreat that the Senate of this nation, âto whom
this plan is particularlv addressed, âwill turn their
eyes to a fpe&acle now at their bar.â
âBehold a trembling group of am table females !
examine them narrowly, and perhaps )Ou will
nnd an aunt, a filler, or a niece amongst them.
See ! they kneel, and present to you, with down
cart eyes and melancholy countenances, a petition
.vhich contains the substance of these pages. D -
not disregard it j nor avert your eyes from he
lovely suppliants. Approach and raise them.
And with philanthropy beaming from your brows,
address them in words to thisefteft Be com
Jorted. We are sensible of your grievances, and
will redress them in the manner you desire. We
confefs we have too long lavished the wealth of
the nation in ere&ing sumptuous edifices, and in
creating establishments for the comfort, advantage
and convenienceof our own sex, while we have
ungratefully negk&ed yours, to whom we are not
'>iil\ indÂ«bted for ourexiftence, but for the tew
sweets which are mingled in the bitter cup we re
ceived from our firft parents. We eagerly em
brace the opportunity which now offers itfelf of
compensating for our negledl and ingratitude.
We owe you too some reparation for the misery
we have induced on many of your sex. But you
have hastened the day of retribution. âRetire in
full confidence that your prayer has been propiti
