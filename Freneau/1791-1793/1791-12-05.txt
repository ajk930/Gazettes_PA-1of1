On MONUMENTS,
Notwithstanding the num
ber of extraordinary men the French
Revolution has produced to the world,
the name of great is thought to convey
an idea too extensive to be allowed tc
more than one man, and what ought tc
be understood by the word great is ad
mirably defined by one of the Frencl
orators. It is also very much to be ad
mired, that previous to the revcrlutior
two men only were allowed the nami
of great ; thenecelTary consequence wil
be that great men, being confiderec
as they really are, very few in number
that august title will never be difputec
by their impartial cotemporaries, and i
still more disinterested posterity.
It was the opinion of Swift, that ;
nation does not give birth to moic thar
one truly great man in less than io<
years. I have the honor to think th<
lame ; and for a definition of the wore
great in its proper extensive meaning
I prefer the French orator to whom i
have already alluded.
If we allow one great man to be pro
duced in an hundred years by every ci
vilized nation upon earth, the numbe;
to be handed to a remote posterity wil
be quite fufficient to latisfy human va
nity and pride.
It may be enquired what I mean by ;
great man. I am lure my idea of ,
great man is, when his works are di
rested to the benefit of mankind, in th<
perfedlion of any human art or fcienci
irom which the prcient or future age
must derive eternal benefit ; and legiila
tors come most particularly within thi
meaning. No one can deny the autho
of the French Revolution to be a mar
of this <\<fcriptio,p. i i]Ol is al
lowed by that nation itfelf to be Mira
beau. The latest posterity must b<
benefited by the bleflings of liberty
For he has the honor to be the cause o;
the next generation being born Free
which otherwise would have beer
slaves. A greater honor cannot in m)
opinion be conferred on human nature
The French verv modestly allow the ho
nor of this blessed freedom to one man
notwithstanding his numerous coadju
tors, and this very wifely, that tli<
word great should not be confounded
which it is in this country, by bestow
ing it on such prodigious numbers, anc
for such very moderate degrees of me
rit. By thus multiplying great men
vanity countera&s its own efforts, anc
we cease to have any great men. Whet
posterity surveys the monuments i.r
Westminster Abbey, and finds them in
numerable, they must, if they take i
upon credit of monumental teftimqny
suppose that their ancestors were al
great men, without exception. But i
they go about to enquire for the work
of their illustrious ancestors, they w:l
be told that their performances, aswel
as themselves, being of a pcrifhable na
ture, have been long since buried in ob
livion, as would the monuments, bu
for the hardness anddurability ofa mar
ble. Great men's works arc not of ;
perishable nature :
" Fini/k'd writings theft and tint defy,
" The only monvmcnti zv/iich cannot die.'"
But such are not the productions of th<
fiftieth part of our monumental ancef
tors. How a man would be laughed a
if he took the name from a monumen
in the Abbey, or elsewhere, and ther
went to enquire for those ftupendou:
performances for which he was sup
posed to have that honor conferred
or rather, how would he ftarewher
informed his works were so trifling, tha
they scarcely survived the mournins
at his funeral. But these are not th<
eirors of the nationâthey are theabfurd
itiesof a fewinterefted individuals, wh(
contribute to such empty foppery fron
the opinion they have of themselves

PARIS, Sept. 21.
The Municipality, as the firft efforl
to aid their fellow citizens in deriving
thegreateft poflible advantage from the
new Constitution, have proposed the
following cjueftions :
1. What are the best means, within
the power of the Municipality, of exci
tineih Paris the efforts of industry. and
O ... '
encouraging in it the establishment oi
manufactures of all kinds ?
2. What are the belt means, within
the power of the municipality of pro
curing for the capital ail the advantages
which it may hope from general com
merce with refpeÂ£t to its lituation, the
lumber and chara&er of its inhabitants,
it connexion with the departments ol
:he kingdom and with foreign nations.
For each of the two best answers, on
hefe questions, to be sent in before the
firft of February, they offer a gold me

the four next a gold medal of 200 livrcs
value.
LONDON, Sept. 18.
Ten of the repiclentatives of Paris for
the next Wiflature were chosen whrn
the last ac 'unts came away. The
whole numbei is twenty-four, and the
cleftors go on at the rate of one per day.
In other parts of the kingdom the
cleftions being less contested, proceed
with greater dispatch.
In iome instances the whole repre
sentatives of a department have been
slefted in one day.
The establishment of Justices of Peace
by the new Constitution is univcrfally
approved. As an instance, M. Riviere,
elected a justice in the diftritt of Bour
dcaux, in the course of three months
from the time of entering on his office,
had three hundred and twelve cases
brought before him. Of these he de-
cided three hundred and seven, one wa;
terminated by calling in two arbitrators
and only four came before the tribunal
as the diftrift.
The French emigrants are said to be
r p'.it into two parties. The one at the
lead of which is Conde, wishes to re
tore the old government. The other,
it the head of which is Bouillie, is foi
i modification of the new constitution,
I .'le parties hold no intercourse.
The plan of the latter party is said tc
je a pacific lyftem ; to prevent a nati
jral bankruptcy; to declare the afTignat;
part of the public debt ; to convoke the
>tates General in the ancient form :
einftate the clergy, with a proviso sot

To the Bailly of Lausanne.
I T is easy to fee, moriiieur Bailly
hat ever since the king was arreftedot:
lis flight from the kingdom, the joy ol
he citizens of Laulanne on that occa
ion, was by no means agreeable to you
:nd some of your brethren, in authority
It is perfectly natural, however, that
10th the senate of Berne and yourfelf
hould be chagrined at such an event
tnd this confirms us in an opinion we
iave for some time entertained, thai
he greater part of the European fove
eigns and ruling powers confidcr the
French Revolution in a very differenl
?oint of view from their fubjeÂ£ts. Thh
onfideration, nevertheless, makes u:
no re than ever in love with it.
Tell your masters, monsieur Bailly
hat the people of France acknowledge
10 masters. * The government and the
people are fynor.imous terms, and afi
in ccr.ceit for the ciUblilhir.ent, anc
âI
srefervation of liberty, vvhofe reign,
â hey hope, will prove perpetual.
When, instead of replying to the
Friends of the Constitution,' you ad-
Jreffed the municipality of Dijon, we
fuppole the idea did not occur to you,
:hat the municipality is "chosen by the
fuffrages of the people, and that they
would of consequence take part with
the people, rather than blame thein lor
rongratulating their neighbours on the
revolution in France.
Presume not, therefore, in future, to
write to our municipality to punish us
r or congratulating our lriends in Lau
sanne. It is miierable policy in you,
00, to advise them to fall upon mea
ures to prevent our addrefles in future.
Do you imagine that the wretched
Mercenaries, lu: king on the frontiers of

'lake care how you interrupt the

S true, do not wish for war ; neither
lo they fear it. They can, 'if occasion

hey can level tyrants in the dult, and
with the other they can illume the

PARIS, September 6.
The Bourdeaux chamber of commerce has im
portunatelv demanded ihe recall of the decree
granting liberty and equal privileges with th
whiles to the Mulattoes in St. Domingo. Thi
is diieÂ£tly contrary to the opinion of the citizen
of Bourdeaux, who in their petition on this sub
jest, voluntarily offered to embark in quality 0
loldiers, to compell the coloniUs to comply will
the decree of Mav 15th. The municipality am
friends of the conllitution wished to prevent th
letting out of the messenger that had been en
gaged to carry the addreTs of the chamber c
commerce to the National Aifembly ; but th
mercantile and nav;il bodies urged Ins departure
considering, no doubt, that the commercial inter
efts had at lead as good aright to petition, as thi
club conftitutionifts.
An Addrefsfrom the Merchants and Captains of th
Port of Havre dt Grace, to the National AJftm
bly of France.
GENTLEMEN,
Since the publication of your dÂ°creeof Ma;
15, the merchants andcaptains of this port trad
ing to the French colonies in the Wefi-lndies, o
who have connexions there, have not failed con
llantly to represent to you the impossibility o
your new mode of colonial government beinj
carried into execution.â We arc sorry to fai
that the clamours of malevolence, ignorance, o
intrigue have ftifled our just complaints. Con
vinced in our own minds of the lumous conle
quencesof this decree, we have therefore beei
. end rained to lament in filcnce the inefficacy o
our address.
Happy (hould we find ourselves, to be de
ceived in our apprehensions of ill, but, alas
what we foreboded has really come to pass.
Inthetownof Cape-Francais, and in all thi
northern parts ofSt. Domingo, upon the firft in
tt'llLence of this ill judged decree, rage and in
dignation took possession of the minds of thi
white inhabitants ; party quarrels and difference
of opinion iofiantly ceased, aid all were unitcc
in the co'.nm .n cause âthey tmiverfally agrcec
to facrifice their lives a thouland times, and be
buried in the ruins of their unfortunate country,
rather than remain passive fpettators of their in
dividual defltuftion.
We give you, Gentlemen, anexaftcopy ofthe
expressions we have received of ihe feelings ol
the inhabitantsâdo not suppose, then, that the
difcontentj of the colonifls will be confined tc
empty exclamations and vain menaces.
We tremble when we tell you, that a motior
has been made in the General Aflcmbly to hoifl
the Englilh flag, in the island of St. Domingoâ
and the motion was highly applauded.
In this, their season of terror and calamity, the
treasuries of the ifiand are flint, commerce is in
â¢crtupted, payments are at an end, every citizen
las become a soldier, and preparations are every
where made for vigorous warfare.
At the Cape, the batteries of fort Picolet have
iccn manned to repulse those who fhull be so har
iy as to come there with their doctrines of Na
lipnal liberty and philanthropyâdoilrines,atonce
(oductive of blood and of cruelty.
The citizens, the governmental bodies, the re
gular troops ; all have but one mind ; one loal :
hey are ready to curse the connexions that ally
hem to France; and in the moments ol defpera
:ion, loudly exclaim, that the parent country is
he mother of cruelties.

CONSOLIDATION.
MUCH has leen faic], and not without rea
son, against a consolidation of the States
nto one government. Omitting lesser objeflions,
wo consequences would probably flow front furli
r change in our political system, which juflify
he cautrons used againll it. Fi'jl, it would be
mpoflible to avoid the dilemma, of either relin
juilhing the present energy and responsibility of
1 Jingle executive magiflrate, for feme plural fub
[litute, which by dividing so great a trust might
eflon the danger of it ; or differing so great an ac
-umulation of poweis in the hands of tat offi
:er, as might by degrees transform him into a
monarch. The incompetency of one Legifla
ure to regulate all the various objefls belonging
0 the local governments, would evidently force
1 transfer of many of them to the executive de
partment; whilst the encreafing splendour and
umber of its prerogatives supplied by this source,
night prove excitements to ambition too power
cl for a sober execution of the eleflive plan,
md consequently strengthen the pretexts for an
hereditary designation of the magiflrate. Second,
,vere the date governments abolished, the fame
"pace of country that would pioduce an undue
growth of the executive power, would prevent
hat ccntroul on the Legislative body, which is
.ffential toafaithful discharge of its trull, neither
he voice nor the sense of ten or twenty millions
jf people, spread through so many latitudes as are
omprehended within the United States, could
â¢vet be combined or called into effect, if depriv
d of ihofe local organs, through which boih can
iow be conveyed. In such a (late of things, the
mpoffibility of afling together, might be fuc
xedtd by the incflxacy of partial expreflions oÂ£
he public mind, and this a; length, by a univer
sal fllejice and insensibility, leaving the whole
government 10 thai JtlJdireEltd courje, which, it
null be owned, is the natural propensity of
:very government.
But if a consolidation of the dates into on
lovernment be an event so juflly to be avoided,
it is not lcls to be delired, on the other hand, that
1 consolidation (liould pievail in their interefis
ind affetlions ; and this too, as it fortunately hap
pens, forihe very reasons, among others, which
Lie agamd a governmental consolidation. For, in
:he fnft place, in proportion as uniformity is
found to prevail in the interelU and fentimenis
ufthe several dates, will be the practicability ct
iccommodating Legijlative regulations to them,
ind thereby of withholding new and dangerous
prerogatives from the executive. Again, thegrea'-
r the mutual confidence and affetlion of ad
larts of the Union, the more likely they will be
o concur amicably, or to differ with moderation,
n the eleÂ£live designation of the chief magiflrate ;
and by such examples, to guard and adorn the vi
al principle of our republican confiituuon.
Ladly, the lefsthe supposed difference of inter
;fls, and the greater the concord and confidence
ihroughout the great body of the people, the
more readily mud they sympathize with each
other, the mpte seasonably can they interpcf: acommon mariifeflation cf their fentimcnts, the
itiore certainly will they take the alarm at ufur.
pation or oppression, and the more effe&ually
will they covjo/idateihtir defence of ihe public
liberty.
Here theh is a proper objc& presented, both tc
those who are mod jealously attached to the sepa
rate authority rcferved to the states, and to thofc
who may be more inclined to contemplate the peo
ple of America in the light of one nation, .Let
the former continue to watch against every en
croachment, which might lead to a gradual cbn
folidation cf the states into one government. Let
the latter employ their utmost zeal, by eradicating
local prejudices and mistaken rivalftiips, to confol"
iclate the affairs of the states into one harmonious
interest ; and let it be the patriotic study of all, to
maintain the various authorities established by our
complicated fyflem, each in its refpe&ive condi
tional fphcre; and to erecfb over the whole, one
paramount Empire of reason, benevolence and
brotherly affedion.

By the brig Betsey, Capt. RmTel, which arrived
at this port on Friday last in nineteen days fron:
Cape Francois, we are informed that no materia
change had taken place, at the time he left it
from the accounts received by former arrivals
The Negroes were proceeding as usual in ravaging
the Island, and burning and destroying the fugai
plantations, and no proipe<3 to the whites of either
accommodation or conquest, unleis backed by a
considerable number of troops from abroad, ol
which there was 110 appearance when the above
vtflel left the Cape, although many a wjihful look
was thrown out for their arrival.âThe report
was not authenticated, of the Spaniards having gi
ven the Negroes affillance, as intimated in some
former advicev : The infurresion rather appear
ed to have been the effect of long premeditation,
the florcs of gunpowder, &c. being collected im
perceptibly, before any suspicions of infurre&ion
were entertained, âAmerican produce was low ;
fuperfine flour about thirty-two {hillings this cur
rency per barrel, and pork gl. 15s. per barrelâ
cadi scarce, and the produce of the island high, in
conference of the fcarcity.âlt was cxpected
that exportation would entirely cease in a short
time, the sugar works being almost universally at
a {land for waht of labourers.
I .ate accounts from the country about the Mi
ami and Muflcingum rivers, mention exceeding
heavy rains to have fallen in thofc parts from the
middle of September, to October, such as have
not been known since the settlement of that part
us the United States.
F.xtracl of a letterfrom Pitjburgh November 18.
" Having returned some time since from the
town of Marietta, I mufl own to vOu, that while
there, 1 participated fully in the surprize, with
v.hich all travellers are flruck at the view of the
lemains of those immense fragments of Indian
antiquity, that are still seen at the junflion of the
JVlufkingum and Ohio rivers. From the vari
ous relations I had formerly heard of these rem
nanls of antiquity, 1 had been willing to persuade
myfelf that they were only the sports of nature,
and that imagination might have formed mole
hills into pyramids and walls fifty or sixty feel
high. Ido allure you my opinion was wholly
changed upon my late survey, and I am now
convinced from a view of the Mufkingum works,
and accounts of othcis farther weft, that nations
mull once have existed in these interior parts ol
America almost as superior to those we call the
aboriginal Indians, in the art of war, as we are ai
the present day superior to the fame people, sup
posing them deftiiute of fire arms, and confined
10 their bows and darts.
" From any thing that I could fee, these grand
remnants of the labours of the ancients of this
country may be of thiee or four thousand years
{landing. Certain it is, the present Indians can
give no rational account, of the authors of such
works, but evidently deviate into fable, whene
ver they pretend to talk on the fubjeft.âAs to
ourselves, we alio are only of yejterday, and know
nothing.âWe may rationally luppole, however,
that the revolutions in the history of man on this
continent, must bear some analogy to what we
know has been the cafe in Europe and Aft.i.
At certain periods of time the northern nations,
of the old world, being more robust, hardy, en
terprizing and bold, as well as urged on by the
powerful incentive of poverty, have always over
run those to the southward, and having incor
porated themselves with the vanquilhed, at
length become as effeminate arid cowardly as the
others, and then been conqueied again in their
turn by northern invaders.
" But at the period referred to in America,
when these works were raised, a total extirpation
of the civilized must have taken place ; valour
and {kill must have been overpowered by num
ters, and the Hyperborean barbarians, like an
iirefiftable torrent must have carried all before
them. The numerous tombs that are seen in
the remains of this ancient fortrefs at the Muf
kingum confluence with the Ohio, may not im
probably contain the bones of those, who, while
by their superior {kill in fortification they repel
led the enemy from their town, yet at length
fell victims to hunger and want of supplies ol
food, from which they were cut off by their in
vaders âNever could a better place have beer
chosen for defence than this, even supposing th<
besieged without artillery; and it is not natura
ofuppofe that a nation, merely barbarous, erra
:ic, and without the ufeof iron, could have raif
-d such prodigious ftruttures as these, the granc
limenfions of which are as followâa bread worl
ibout fifty feet in height, and increasing gradu
tily in thickhef> to the bale, where it is fifty yard
n diameter. This breastwork is near two hun
J red and fifty yards in circumferrence. I fhal
letail some other curious particulars, relative tc
hefe works, in a future letter."
'lutkenlic Intelligence cf frejh Dijlurftances amoni
the Creek Indians.
The public have been informed, by r.umerou
)aragraphs extracted from the London papers
hat a Mr. Bowles arrived in England from Ame
ica, in the coiirfeof the year 1790, with fevera
Indians belonging to some of the southern tribe
âThat the said Bowles, and Indians, had receiv
:d countenance and fuppcrt, to a certain degree
m.d that they failed from England, during th
ourfe of the last summer, enriched with pre
ents, for the Bahama IflandS.
It now appears, that the said Bowles, after ai
iving at the Bahamas, failed for India River, f
ailed, lying on East Florida, and thence pro
ceded to that part of the Creek country inhn
:ited by the Seminclies, where he arrived in th
month of September last.
That at the time of his arrival, the Creeks! wer
preparing to execute the treaty, made betwee
:hem and the United States, at New-York, ii
&ugufti79o. They had chosen the Chiefs ti
ittend at the Rock-Landing 011 the firft of Oc
icber, the lime slated for running the boundar
ines mentioned in the treaty âThe White Bin
ring of the Cufitahs being of this commiflion.
Bowles's appearance however at that crifis-*
he prefects he brought with and his boh
tfTertions, caufcd great agitations and hefitatioi
imong the ignorant part, and of course amonj
he mass of the Creeks.
Although it appears that a considerable por
ion of the upper Creeks, and indeed all the rel
>edable Chiefs, were for running the line, not
vithftanding the delusions of Bowles, it is pre
umed that he is an impofior âBut, he pretends
4 he has powers from the Biitifhr government t<
:onclude a treaty with the Creeks âThe basis o
vhich (ball be a revocation, on their part, of th<
reaty with the United States, and a guarantee o
ill their lands "
He has fpiead reports, that he has three {hip:
oaded with goods, arms and ammunition, ant
:annon âthat if the Creeks will permit him, h<
vill efrablifh a fort, and trading houses, atwhicl
he Creeks (hall be supplied with goods of al
ons, upon better terms than ever they have been
ind that he had fix thousand men, in the islands
eady to support him.
That he would wiite to Georgia, and preven
he lines being run, and he accordingly has writ
en to the Commissioners, who were waiting a
he Rock-Landing, expeÂ£Vmg the Creek Chiefs
vhich letter is dated at " Ufachees, O&ober 26
.791," and signed, " General Wm. A. Bowles
lireÂ£ior of alFairs for Creek nation." In thi
etter, and in his general declarations, he asserts
hat Alexander M'Gillivrav has deceived the In
lians in the treaty made at New-York; but, tha
le is willing to form a treaty with the Unite<
itates in behalf of the Creek nation, and declare
hat the former treaty (ball not be executed.
The Indians, diflracied by his arts, have en
reated the United States to wait until tin
pring, before the boundary ihall be marked, ani
f Bowles, whom they style the u lying captain,'
hall then turn out an impoilor, they will attenc
tnd run the boundary lines without further dif
iculty.
It appears that Ivlr. M'Gillivray has faithfully
tdheredtothcintei cllsof the United States, warm
y recommending that the line fbould be run a
he time appointed, and that Bowles's falfchood
hould be entirely dilregarded âIndeed, his 1m
>ortance, and lite, probably depend on Bowie:
>eing driven out of the nation.
A considerable detachment of the troops ol
he United States, and Mr. Elicott the surveyor
ind three refpefciable Commissioners from tht
late of Georgia, were afTembled punctually a
he Rock-Landing, 011 the Oconee, the firtt o
October, and they waited lor the Creek chief:
tntil the beginning of November, when the)
lifpaired of the business being effedted this season

Â»f considerable investigation in this country
hat, as mercantile intercourse is the basis cl
wealth to modern nations, that therefore in time
Â»f war, the arms of the belligerent powers fhoulc
>e dire&ed againfl their proper object, the of
ending state, and the property of individual:
onfidered as sacred, particularly in cases of na
ral capturesâWhat is light in morals is ofter
vfong in politics; which, considering things ir
he outline, and mankind in the aggregate can
lot flop at small improprieties, nor private inju
res, where a public end is in view. War is fly
ed by some, a neccfTary evil; perhaps it
iave been better exprefled, an unavoidable evil;
or, there being no tribunal before one
late can arraign another, each snatches up it;
irms, force decides right, and this is the law ol
ftture by which the claims of na ions are deter
nined. In such contests, individuals are noi
nuch the better for being spared by the enemy j
'or, if refpeft be paid by an enemy to private
jroperty, while the slate is reduced to extremity,
t will drain its fubjeds for supplies, as long a!
hey can furnifh any : So that the quefiion is re
duced to this alternative, whether we shall dif
tress a people in the RrO mOnnce, or ?t fcond
landâPolitics and morals will unite in deciding,
:ha'. if a people arc to be diilrefffcd, the quickeil
modes of distress, will put the fpecijieft end to a
war; for popular clamours tend to pcace : It
war is,a jaeceffaiy evil, and to be dircfted
igainft the ruling power ol a Hate, princes fliould
decide their quarrels by the judicial combat, or
3y duel. If tile live; ofcfubje&s are surrendered
up to slaughter till t he weaker date can raise no
more, is it lets than mockery to fay, kill the peo
ple c.s fall as you can, but Ipare their property !
Fb? diftinÂ£tion betweem armed and unarmed is
lolt in the reflexion, that the commercial class
support and animate the military class. It has
been observed, that were the seizing of mercan
tile vcflels in time of war, universally abolished,
it would make no alteration as *o the compara
tive flrength of the contending powers; and it
would place them on an equal footing with such
as might 1 appen to be at peace. At present, the
Utter enrich themfelvts at their expence : they
snatch their trade out of their hands: they sup
ply them at a high price with thole very articles,
with which, if their trade were fieej they might
at a much cheaper rate iup'ply ihemfelvcs, to the
pjotra&ion of hostilities, and greater deftrufction
ps lives.âTo leave an enemy's fubjeÂ£ta in cafe
and security is to preserve the sinews of war ia
fu"H vigO-, and at the fame time to restrain their
exertions. It is found, in the inflance of gun
powder, that to accelerate the intention of hos
tilities, is to render war less deflru&ive, and to
save lives; but, to drag on a dilatory war, cramp
ed by discriminations, like law-suits, would oper
ate inversely. War is too flagrant a violation
of all social obligations, to submit to moral re
flations ; but if ever the politics of Europe, 01
the law of nations should be so far improved by
general consent, as that national dilpiites could
be referred to national arbitration, and the
flrength of the whole be applied to enforce sub
mission, all necessity for vain efforts to regulate
violence by critical diftiu&ions, would happily
vanifli.
IT has long been matter of complaint, that the

Dt several diseases, which in a great rtieafure have
baffled thv pOwcr of medicine, and proved pecu
liaily fatal to infants and childrert under seven
3r eight years of age. The medical society in
Delaware, taking into consideration the periodi
cal yearly havock made by distempers incideni
to the situation and foil of that slate, hasfketched
the outlines of a plan for invefligating the nature
of such diseases, and, if poflible, counteracting
their effe&s, upon the principles of reason anc
philosophy. Toaccomplifh this interefling de
ligO, they consider no plan so likely to succeed,
as ihe establishment of a fund to defray the ex
pence of Prizc-dijfotations, both at home and
from abroad, in the invelhgation of the nature
and cure of thefc complaints. âIn difcuflingthis
question, however, they premise, that no atten
tion will be paid to doctrjnes founded on mere
hypothetical reasoning; facls and experiments
being the only ground, on which they can con
sent to draw conclufionsâlt will be required,
too, in those who (hall contend for the annual
pike cn this fubjeft, that the morbid cauÂ£e be
analyzedâ that its precise origin, conflitution and
qualities be ascertained ; as well as its mode ol
introduction, and operation on the human lyf
lem. Upon this plan it may be hoped that some
power, deduced from the substance or juices of
ihe vegetable creation, will be discovered, tc

To bear Sangrado preach and pray j
But objefls there
Black, brown, and fair,
Turn'd eyes and heart a different way.

Miss Moliy's man
"With powder'd hair and dimpled check,
Miss Delia's eyes,
That once made prize
Of FopLng, with his hair so fleck.
Embroidered gowns,
And play-house tunes
Eftrang'd all hearts from heav'n too wide :
1 felt most odd,
This house of God
Should all be flutter, pomp, and pride.
Now, pray be wife,
No prayei j will rife
To heavenâwhere hearts are not sincere :
No chdrc'n was made
"For Cupid's trade,
Then why these arts of ogling here ?
Since time dratfs nigh
When you and I
At church mull claim the sexton's care J
Leave piide at home
Whene'er you come
To pay to Heaven your offeringsâthere.

stance has taken place from religious
prejudices, which has considerably al
layed it. In the city of Prague there is
a great number of Jews who principal
ly inhabit that part called the Little
Side. As in the reign of the Emperor
Joseph 11. they obtained the privileges
of citizens, and as the principles of tol
eration openly profeffed by Leopold 11.
did not permit them to entertain the
least uneasiness on the fubjeft, they felt
themselves inclined to ast like the other
citizens, to prove their attachment to
our Sovereign, who is likewise theirs ;
in consequence of which, they armed
and formed themselves into companies,
for the purpose of parading like the o
ther Corporations, on the entrance of
their Imperial Majeftics, The Catho
lics would not fuffer it. Both parties
were irritated, and the quarrel rose to
such a height that they fired on each
other. On each fide there were some
killed and wounded. The interpolition
of the garrison became nerpflary, which
was attended with much success. The
wife precaution was adopted, ofjfhutting
up the Little Side, and thereby cutting
off, for the moment, all communication
between that quarter and the other part
of the city. It is hoped that the fer
ment will subside ; there is, however,
but too much reason to fear for the con
sequences.
LONDON, September 15.
The Emperor of Germany and the
Empress of Russia, beginning to feel the
havock made in their finances, arc both
soliciting loans, the former at four per
cent, the latter at five per cent.
The debt of the Empress is immense,
as besides what {he owes to foreign nati
ons, there is hardly a merchant of any
eminence in her own dominions to
whom Ilie is not a debtor; her resources,
however are great, and her mind seems
to be equal to all her contingencies.
The above loans, with the American
loan, have drawn from this country
within these three weeks, near a mil
lion sterling ; yet such is the flourifhing
condition of our commerce, and the
great influx of wealth from all Europe,
that notwithstanding the above sum,
with the expence of the late armament
before us, the stocks have scarcely fal
len one "half percent.
The report of the day is, that the
Courts of Berlin and Vienna are on the
point of concluding an alliance offenlive
and defenfive, by which they engage to
guarantee one another's dominions : to
thisalliance.it is fa; 4 that the courts of
Russia and Stockholm, will likewise ac
cede.
By the Registers of Cadiz andLifbon,
the importation of gold and silver from
South America,upon an average, is five
millions annually. Of this above a mil
lion is brought every yearinto England,
in return for the manufactures sent to
Spain and Portugal, independent of raw
materials, wine, fruit, fait &c. obtained
from these countries. Thus it happens,
from the superior industry of the Bri
tish manufacturers, and the spirit of en
tcrprife among the merchants, that the
nines of Mexico, Peru, and Brazil, pro
duce more solid advantages to this coun
ty, than they do to the Spaniards and
Portuguele.
Sept. ?.o.j Letters received witnir
these tew days from Cadiz dcfcribe the
situation of the people there, and in moll
3ther parts of Spain, as perfettly uneaf)
md difatisfied. Th'e recent rigorou:
mcafures taken to repress the progref:
jf the French principles have general
y encreafed, and, in some in/lances
:reated popular difcontcnts. French
politics are the general topic, and when
:ver they are difcufled, the conduct oi
he National Alfembly is talked of with
rapture and admiration. From the gen
eral temper of thepublic mind, it fhoulc
"eem as if the people waited only for;
Favorable conjuncture ofcircumflance;
-O imitate the conduCt they admire,
The government in Spain never verv
[frong, is now, from its apprehension:
ind embarraiTments, less able than evei
-O conduct itfelf with proper ftrenotl"
and caution, and every day evinces it;
folly by some absurd measure, d-jfignet
0 prevent, but really fitted to execute
public difcontcnt.
Sept. 21. The French National As-
Temblv may be cxpc&ed to give place ir
a few days to the firft Legislature. One
hundred and fifty of the new Reprefen
:atives were arrived in Paris about ter
iays ago, and the number required ii
constitute a Legislative Assembly is tht e.
hundred and seventy-three.
