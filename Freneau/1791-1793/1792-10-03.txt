We are sent here Ly the commons ol 1 avis
We bring into the fanftuary of the laws
the sentiments of the inhabitants ol an irn
nienfe city. Full of r-ipeft towards the
reprefentative6 of the nation, relying mly
on their patriotic courage, they do not
despair of the public fafety ; but it h their
opinion that, in order to cure radically the
disorders of France, they mult be attacked
at the root, and th; t not a moment is to
be loft It is with {.rief that they, through
my organs, denounce to you the head oj
the executive pover. It is not to be doubted
that the peoule have great cause to be in
censed against him, but the language of in
dignation ill becomes men who have the
power in their own hands. Forced by
Louit XVI, to aceufe him before you ami
before all France, we (hall accuse him
without making use of hitter expressions,
but we (hall not spare him. It is so lon
ger time to make use of that long-tried
forbearance which well becomes a gener
ous people, but encourages kings to be
' euilty of p""jury. The noblest paffijns
iiuft give way, when the falvarion of the
ilate is at stake.
We wil' not del neate the whole conduit
of Louis XVI, from the full days of tli
revolution. We will not remind you of
his sanguinary piojefts againll the city of
! his piej.!

he has mar.ifefted towards the bulk of tht
p eo plcâof the Constituent Aflsmbly be
ing insulted by Valets de la Cour, invest
ed by armed men, wandering about in a
; voyal town, and finding noafy-um, except
j in a Five's Court. We will not remind
you of his oaths so repeatedly broken, nor
' of his renewed protestations so repeatedly
falfified by his adions, until his trea
1 cherous flightopened the eyes ev;n ofthofe
citizens the molt blinded by the c ithufiafm
' of slavery. We wi'l not recall all tha: is
passed over by the generous pardon of the
people ; but there is a difference between
pardon and oblivion. It would be in vain
to drive to forget all his crimes. With
them the historic page will be polluted.
Posterity will remember them.
It is our duty briefly to recall to your
minds the acts of beneficence shewn by the
people towards Louis XVI and the ingra
titude of that prince. How many reaf ns
were there for fettinghim afidea' the mo
' ment that the people regained the fove
reignty ! The remembrance of an impe
rious and deftrr.ftive dynalty among whom
is found one king for twenty tyrants ; th
hereditary despotism encre;:fmg with each

lie finances entirely ruined by Louis XV >,
and his two immediate predecessors ! trea
ties the most infamous polluting tl.i na
tional honour ; the eternal -enemies o
France become its allies and its mailers
these constituted the claims of Louis XVI,
to the constitutional sceptre !
The nation, faithful to its character, has
preferred generosity to prudence. 1 lit
defpotof a land of ilaveiy, is become tl
king of a free people. After having a -
tempted to quit France in order to reign
at Coblcntz, he has been replaced on the
throne against. the sense of the nation,
which ought to ha\e been consulted.
Innumerable favours have followed th s
grand ast of generosity. During the lat
ter period of the constituent alTembly we
iiave seen the rights of the people weaken

'strengthened. The fnft public FonSion

up, and ported themselves with two pieces
of cannon in a gentleman's gan .n that

their muiketry and the one piece of can*
non they had left, till their am munition
was entirely gone, when they made an
honourable and Â£:fe retreat, Of iksFrench four were killed, on tin's occasion,
and iotir of the villagers aflafiinated by
the AuÃrians on tJieir entrance inti> Or

favorable accounts make 460 1011. This
loss however wjis so great', that when the
general, by the returns given him, after
their return 10 Tournay, fawthe number
or killed, wounded n'iid miffrng, he declared
it could not be, such Eli havoc could eÂ«er
have been made by 400 men ; and threw
out inlinustions as if the officers had be
trnyed the men. These inlinuationt were
conveyed in lime to the foidiers, who three
'or four days ago rose in a tumultuous man
ner, wnd fvfcore they would not be led any
more like (beep to the (laughter for other
people. Soon after this they proceeded
to rioting, and laid hold of iix emigrants,
whom they conducted to the gallows. Of
these they hi.ng five. The fixih was cut
down alaioll on tlie moment of fufpcnlion,
I J persons present, who attempted to rea
son with the foldierson their conduct. The
calm however was only temporary, and
when the teropell broke out again, the
general ordered the gates to be (hut, and
they have continued so to this day What
has been going on within the walls of
Tournay, since the time of its being lock
ed up, nobody here knows. But before
they wet e locked up a p rfon got out of
the town, who conveyed the above news
to a gentleman at St Qmei's, among o
thers, the <father of a young piieft, who
was cut down from the gallows, as related
above. The above si uation of tilings
may be very favorable to the affairs of
France ; for it is a proof that the German
soldiers begin to think for themselves, and it
is perhaps the firft inllance of their op
poling their own officer?.
The Declaration of the Duke of IJrunf

to the per. of Calonne. It certainly
possesses all the fury of that paflionate de

to refute his reafbning", and, like men, to

of these truths being pulhed to an Â£xtSme;

Rtfolved uranimoufly,
THAT whilst we conlldcr it as incon

tion of the United States, and the rights
of our filler Hates, to enter into any gene

they are immediately affefledâwe at the
lame time consider tfeadmiflion of Haves,
or other persons convi&ed of crimes, into
this Hate, as being highly impolitic and
dangerous to the citizens thereof. And
we are informed from' authority, that per?
sons from some of our filler Hates, regard

Rtfoivetl, That until the next meeting

" From present appearances we have no
reason to expect even a temporary peace
with the hostile Indians. From the rno/t
authentic information we can hear, and
from various corroborating reports and
communications, we have every ground to
conclude, that they Iwve deliberately, .and
by tie voice of.cpnncil, maflacred those
men who bore to tiiL l the flags of pe->ce.
This barbarous violation of the laws of alt
nations, savage as well as civiliztd, can
admit of no mitigation ; and the national
character and honor of America Stands
bound to punish, with the mull exemplary
Severity arms can infiift, thirfavage infiilt.
They feeni to be pofTeflid of the molt im
placable Spirit of ferocity, and ridicule the
idea of a peace or treaty. They kuigh at

View of the political fauation of fevcral
European powers, Thretpett to t'rifitee.
IT was forefeen from the very com
mcncemenr of the French revolution, that
! it would excite numerous anil powerful e
| nrfnies against that nation. Inter:.ally,
i those whose interelts were injured bv the
j change in the government, and confeqtient
)v their paflioos and prejudices inflamed.
Externally, the enemies of the devolution
were those delpotic princes, who were a
larmcd for their- arbitrary power, or wil
ling to profit by the intestine divisions aiki
j parties through the kingdom, were deter
; mined to make the most of them fC-r their
| own emolument. At the'commencement'
of the revolution the univerfa! state of
| thing' feetucd to favor it. RnfTia.was em -
j barraffed with- a double warfare against
Sweden and Turkey. Austria was ex
hausted by three brilliant but ruinous cam
paigns ; conquering barren defarts in the j
east merely to restore them again, and se
riously engaged in the weft in reconquer
ing her revolted provinces ; and" menaced
more or less with popular infurreftions in
the different parts of her extensive domini
ons. Pruflia, whose intrigueshad in a great
measure contributed thus to embarra's her
rival, was only watching ail opportunity 10
declare herfelf openlVi to give the last fatal
Wound to the AuStrian power. England
and Spain upon the Mimt of declaring war
on account of lomc fl((Jkched factories on
the other fide pi the grebe, and merely to
fuppor.t a petty mercantile interestâAll
Europe, iu short, was more or less at vari- :
ance with itfelf, either from the ambition
of its' leading powers, or from the general
discontent ot the people, in whom the ex
ample of the French hud awakened an idea
of their own Strength and power. But the
views of the several powers are now, in a
great measure, changedâthe paflions of re
gal powers have assumed another charac
ter : we must therefore make new calcula
tions from the relations that actually exiSt.
It ought not to be concealed, that there
exists in every court of Europe, almost
without exception, a spirit direfily and
pointedly inimical to thoie principles' of li
berty that form the bafts of the French con
stitution. But we must look farther for
the cause of their enmity to the revolutiqn
than mere Speculative opinion. The house
of Auftna, faithfully adhering to her plans
of hereditary ambition, has viewed the
troubles of France as likely to contribute
to'her own aggrandizement ; and having
gained so far upon the court of Prtiffia as
to prevaii upon it to change its former po
licy of real intefeft. She proposes to assume
to herfelf. the advantages that may arise
irutu discord aud party ipiric iu France, â
Although the infraction of the treaty of
1756 ought to have more weight than mere
ly French principles In alienating the court
of Vienna, it appears that the present war
against France is not viewed with a favor
able eye by that power. The court of Ber
lin seems to take a decided part agaiuft
France, altho' Frederick can only be re
garded as the ally of the king of Hungary
and Bohemia. T his dc tided spirit, howe
ver, is not the general spirit of Prutfia, any
more than of the llatefmen and the old ge
nerals who were formed in the fchoÂ«>l of the
great Frederick.. This monstrous alliance
between Pruflia and Austria, which threa
tens the independence of the Germanic
body, cannot be lading, even tho' founded
upon a partizan treaty, and Prulfia were
sure of feeing France once more her natu
ral ally. The difpolitions of the electors
ot Treves and Mayence are 110 less decided
against Fiance than the others. Nothing
has induced them to temporize with France
but the dread of feeing Iter armies in their
territories. lift We ele&orates the French
emigrants have conflantly found an asylum
and protection ; so that France has a right
to consider them as artnally her enemies.
It would be almost fuperfiuous to be very
particular in refpeft to the designs and
views of the Germanic, body; ia general,
they are by no means favorable to France,
and wher. they are, are watched with such
a jealous eye by the majority, as to render
their friendfhip inelfethnl. The neutrali
ty of the Emj.ire is therefore a thing not to
be relied oil'; for, among such of the prin
ces as embrace th; t fyttem, there are leve
rs] who will view matters in a diii'erertt
light, when they fee their fiates guarantied
by the arms of Prussia Stui Aultria. Their
contingent, however, will not be formidable,
both from their slowness in colleftlng their
j troops, and the charter they alWayS fftf
! tain, whenraifed. It is probable therefore
that the contingent of the princes will be
optional, â¢" money or troops ; the former
of which will be the readied ren- idior). Af
ter the ceremony of the coronation of the
emperor, it may be expected he will pub
liih a decla' ation, urging the Emptre to . ar ;
which decoration will effectually c*;plaipt
to the French the real intentions of the feâ
veral German courts, Th.e empress of RufÂ».
fia has not beharcd towards France witht
that treacherous difJimuJatioH, and duplici-â¢
ty of sentiment. that for>a lontf Mile atfirOt

early period broke oft id! communlcatjo. 4

Pilnitz. Her alliance with the late king or
Sweden seems to h tve had ivfSther object;
than to form a general combination against
France; her pecuniary ftv.voyrs given to
the emigrants ; the honor (he did the emi
grant princes in fending ministers to their
court at Coblenc.e ; her rigorous edicts a
gainst the French that were fettled in Rnf
lia, when fufpefted of attachment to the
national cause ; all these particulars seem
to point out Catharine the 2d as the impla
cable enemy of France and her liberties.
Her condufl has been uniform on tjiis princi
ple,but managed with some secrecy till such
time as (heTaw Prussia firmly linked in with |
Atilrria, and ready to engage the'Frencli on,
the banks of the Rhine." The Rnfiian-po-1
licy then was developed, and it began to be
perceived that as France was too remote
for the empress of Rnflia to hope to Ihare in
her spoils, Poland bccanie a more intereft
iug object. The invasion of that republic
by the whole Ruffian force, the inactivity
in fitting out fleets of war from the Ruffian
ports, and the neglect shewn to the illuttni
ous French emigrants at the court of Pe
| teriburgh, lead one to believe that all the
: empreis had m view was to deceive the
court of Berlin in regard to her real de
ligns, and that Poland and not France was
from the beginning the object of her plans.
From the very latest advices received from
Peterfburgh, the French emigrants have no
thing more to hope for from that quarter ;
and their envoys, who were.there negoci
ating for squadrons and land forces, have
only been able to obtain one frigate, and
that one was equipped solely to rid Russia of
their company and folititatiohsâThe death
of Gnftavus 3d seems to have changed thÂ®
politics of the court of Sweden. The re
gent never approved of his brother's view*
and projeas ; and it is eaty to fee that he
will not fulfil his inconsiderate engage
ments. He dares not however rafhly'cou
tradift the opinions of the emprr fs of Rus
sia ; and it Â»ill require his btfl political a
biliiies to rid himfelf from The obligatory
claofes of a formal recent treaty. ThU it
the reason that the court of Sweden has nÂ®":
yet relumed its official correspondence with
the French court, nor acknowledged the
new constitution. But the vrtft attentipn
that is shown to the French charge des affair a
at Stockholm, and the free admiflion of the
Frcnch national flag into all the Swed! fli
ports, together with their dilgracing tjie
two miniflers who were oppor j to Franci;
the total want of naval or military
tions, are (trong arguments that the neu
trality of Sweden may be depended on â¢âÂ»
As to Denmark, it has been lie 1- sole poliiy
for a long tiuis to reman a quiet fyeetativof the quarrels that agFtated th? reft of En
rope. This moderate conduit ensures her
peace and prosperity. The present Da.uifh
imtiifter is a man of too much underftand
j ;g to abandon the pacific system of his
country. The rnoft exaif neutrality may
therefore be countcd on from Nth is power,
since its justice, interest, and long c-Kpen
ence of the part are equally concerned
thereinâSardinia has long ni "Vfefted her
-1 elf hoftilely inclined toward) Franc?. The
conrtant asylum she affords the emigrant
princes, the interest (he takes in rheirper
fonal concerns, her refufal to. receive the
French minifler, the preparations Ihe is ma
king so far beyond her ability, the camp of
lo,coo Anfhians that is to be formed after
harvest at the port of Torto ia. and her ac
ceflio.u to the Vienna and Berlin alliance,
are all proofs that France ought ftriclly to
" -watch the motions:; of this poWe-.

putting to death every flag, titât has been

our representatives, can be performed by
I any autnonty, but that of the people. It
, leetu , indeed, peculiarly indelicate and im

whde mius are retailed for the admonition

Sir,
Â«â¢ THE neceftity of preserving our preciou;
country in these critical times, with the fame eou
rage and firmnefs as o-ur ancestors, who, repolinj
in God, founded our republic, under the protec
tion and visible afhiiance of the Almighty, ha:
engaged ail of us, the Cantons and allied ftatcsj
1 maturely to weign, and t<Â» deliberate by oui de
puties allemtoled at Frawenfcld tor that purpose or
the met! proper means ot prelei ving the tranquil
ity and peace of our country, and averting tht
daggers anting to it from abroad.
** In conlequance of thele mature deliberations,
1 we have the honour of addrcllinj to your roya
1 majesty the prefer:: letter, with ihe refptÂ£t which
r we owe you. Following the example our a Â»*
ceftors, we have taken the firtiflflfaf unanimous re
folutiun to observe with Jideli'rTjfln our -fide, thÂ«
mod entire and ftridt neutrality towards the greai
powers artuaily engaged in war, and to tuppoil
the lame by an armed force, as circunilUncei
thill require j for which end we are already for
tifying our frontiers, to put 1)1 em in as tecure a
state as poflible.
" At the fame time we prefumt to conceive
â hopes, that the -Principalities de Neulchatel anj
Vallingin, the republic of Geneva, the V*l di
Munfter (Montreal Grandval) .1* well as thÂ«
other slates of the Bithop de Bale-, who are al
moieorlefs intimately connected with tome o
our co-estates, will be as usual, included in th<
neutrality, and refpe&ed 00 that account as a
every former period. In confcqucnce we earned!;
denrand of your majesty to ifl'ue your orders toi
(he troops which are in the territory of Hortentru;
to be withdrawn, in order that the cantedtrap
territories may b- more fafe, and nvay not li3v
reason to fear an invasion on the partot the billjj

4< After this formal and fulemn declaration o
neutrality, we hope, from the generality of ytru
roval maje'fy, that you will, upon urgent demand
give ordcis that your troops and armies may no
let foot upon the Helvetic territories, that the
may not occupy any poll, that they may not mak
any incursion or traierfe the eountry* tak
the liberty of as before, that >ou will loot
