THE TABLE T. No. LX.
" Among a people well-educated, the ladies have
more flattery bejlowed on them than the gentlemen t and
it begins sooner."
IT cannot be supposed that women have
naturally more prideof characteror more
personal vanity, than men. Both alike have
their paflions and propenlities in nature. The
different modes of male and female education
create a difference in opinions and manners, which
is merely artificial. Vanity, when it is well
managed, is perhaps one of the moit ufeful quali
ties, that either sex pollefles. It is so elastic a
lpringof action as generally stimulates very vi
goroully to the attainment of the object it has in
view. The hero glories in his martial achieve
ments ; the rich man in his riches ; the strong
man in the ftrengthof his arms. But the effeifts
ofvanity are no where foconfpicuoufly, orfo ufe
fully displayed as in regulating the female cha
racter and conduct. It is therefore peculiarly
elfential that it should be cultivated in women,
becaule the cuftomsof society cxpofe the actions
of a female to a scrutiny rigorously exact. She
must be restrained from error by motives Angu
larly strong and lively, or her deportment will
scarcely bear such rigor of inspection.
The flattery bestowed on the ladies by all civiliz
ed people operates upon their vanity, in such a
degree, as to guard them against the temptations,
ty which they are on all fides aflailed. Fondness
for personal decorations, andatafte for elegance
highly cultivated, form an almost impregnable
barrier against the allurements of vice, or the
art 9 of pernicious seduction. It must be confefled,
however, this paflion may be misapplied, and
through the address of artful men, may become a
snare rather than a protection to the unwary fe
male. But the usual efleet of it is different, and
it much oftener protects virtue than betrays it.
Those, who set the highest value upon charac
ter, will be the molt cautious to avoid those stains
that defile it. The complimentary language, in
which ladies are frequently addrelled, encreafes
the ardor of their pride. Of course, they are
less ealily beguiled in to actions that will expose
them to alofs of reputation, than they would be,
liad they less elevated ideas of the worth of cha
racter. The partaffigned to females, in the ma
nagement of domestic concerns, makes it requi
site that they should observe the ftriiteft purity
of manners. Thus it appears that flattery is at
tended with real utility, whatever may be the mo
tive thatgivesrife to it. Indeed when it becomes
a general custom to gratify ladies with polite and
flattering expreflions, men acquire habits of po
liteness as a matter of course, and use such a ci
vility, when they are prompted by no other mo
tives, than merely to appear civil and well-bred.
The mi (application of flattery, in some instances,
should not be urged as an argument against the
general advantages it produces. It saves fifty
characters, where it destroys one.
Pride is a paflion,that with proper management,
may controul many of the excefles of otlier pas
sions. A proud man will scarcely become akna
viih one, and he must lose part of his pride before
he can become a drunkard. With women it has
Hill greater efficacy. The felf-denials they so
cheerfully bear, in many instances, where men
give themselves indulgence, is owing very much
to those lively sentiments of pride, which become
a predominating motive of action. Those who
direct the education of females should give great
attention to the manner in which flattery is paid
to ihem. They should learn to prize such
'virtues and accomplishments as are in themselves
most valuable. The inconvenience, that some
women have derived fron. being too much flat
tered, proceeds from an improper choice of the
qualifications that have been made the obÂ»
jeets of commendation. When care is taken
to inspire them with just ot character,
their veneration for it can never be too much en
creased by complimentsandpralfes.
MR. ADAMS'S LETTERS.
LETTER IX.
Amsterdam, Oct. 16, 17S0.
S 7 R,
THE .ninth question is, " Hc-.u flrong the Eng
lijh land force is in A?nerica ? How Jlrong it
vas at the beginning ? And -whether it increafcs or
diminijhes ?
ACCORDING to the eftiroates laid before par
liament, the army under General Howe, General
Carlton, and General Burgoyne, amount to fifty
five thonfand men, besides volunteers, refugees,
tories, in lhort all the recruits raised in Canada,
Â«iul all other parts of America, under whatever
denomination. If wc suppose that all these, in
SATURDAY, November 7; 17^9.
Canada, and elsewhere, amounted to five thousand
men, the whole, according to this computation,
amounted to sixty tlioufand land forces.
This eltimate, however, mull have been made
from the number of regiments, and must have
supposed them all to be full.
General Howe, however, in his Narrative, page
4J, tells us, that his whole force, at the time when
he landed on Long-Island, in 1776, amounted to
twenty thousand one hundred and twenty one
rank and fileâof which one thousand fix hundred
and seventy-seven were sick.
By a regular return of General Burgoyne's ar
my, after its captivity in 1777, it amounted, in
Canadian provincials, British and German troops,
to upwards of ten thousand men. We may sup
pose, that four thousand men were left in Cana
da for the garrison of Quebec, Montreal, and the
great number of other posts in that province. To
these numbers, if we add the oilicers, we may
fairly allow the whole land force at that time to
be forty tlioufand combatants.
Tliis is all the answer that I ain able to give,
from memory, to the quellion, " How ftrongthe
British army was }"
In order to give an answer to the other, " How
strong it is !" let us consider :
1. There has been no large reinforcement ever
feat to America since that time. They havefent
some troops every yearâbut these never amount
ed to more than recruits, and, probably, rather
fall short of filling up the vacancies which were
made in the cOurfeof the year, by desertion and
death, by sickness and the swordâCo that, upon
the whole, I think it may be fafely said, that the
army never has been greater than it was in 1 776.
But we mull: deduct from this ten thousand
men taken with Burgoyne,one thousand HeJlians
taken at Trenton and Princeton, and indeed,
many more, taken by two or three hundred at a
time, upon other occaiions.
In the next place, we must dedud:, I suppose,
about ten thousand more, sent, since the French
war, to Jamaica, St. Lucia, and the
other Weft-India iiiands.
So that, upon the whole, I think we make an
ample allowance, if we state the whole number
nowin New-York,Carolina, and Georgia,includ
ing all refugees,&c. at twenty thousand men, of
ficers included.
This is, in part, an answer to the question,â
" Whether their force increases or diminilhes ?"
But it fliould be farther considered, that there is
a constant and rapid consumption of their men.
Manydie of sickness, numbers desert, there have
been frequent fkirmiflies, in which they have ever
had more men killed and wounded than the A
mericans:âAnd now, so many of their troops are
in Carolina and Georgia, where the climate is so
unhealthy, that there is great reason to expecft
that thegreateft part of that army will die of dis
ease. And whoever considers the efforts the Eng
lish have made in Germany, Ireland, Scotland,
and England, as well as in America, for seven
years fucceifiTely, to raise menâthe vast bounties
they have offered, and the few they have obtain
ed :âWhoever eonfiders the numbers they must
lose, this year, by the fevei ity of duty, and by
fickuefs, in New-York, Carolina, Georgia, and
theWeft-India islandsâand the numbers that have
been taken going to Quebec, North-America, the
East and Weft-Indies, will be convinced, that all
the efforts they can make will not enable them
for the future to keep their numbers good.
I have the honor to be, &c.

THE OBSERVER. No. 111.
The public debt of the union may be so managed as to
prove a great national benefit.
FEW evils are so great but wisdom and appli
cation may derive from them eventual ad
vantages, which -will more than balance the loss
at firft apprehended. Ot all the evils consequent
upon your late glorious war, the immense debt
incurred by the public hath been esteemed the
great-eft, and one for which a remedy was the
inoft difficult without doing such injufticeto indi
viduals, as must excite the abhorence of lioneft
men. That this hath as yet been a perplexed bu
(iuefs, all will allowâThat this debt with its past
management, hath diftrefled both the people and
the creditors is undeniableâbut we ought not to
impute those diftrettes to the debt itfelf, which
have arofealtnoft wholly from impolitic manage
ment. The people of this country were as new
in the arts of finance, as those of warâin the last
you have excelled and conquered ; and in the firft
may soon become eminent, iffome popular preju
dices donor prevent. It is not strange that your
finances were deranged, and the people and ere-
\Publijbid on IV edutjday and Saturday ,'j
ditors both in a state of fuff'eringunder an admi
liiltration without lyftem or energy, and which
was unable to bring any exertions to a point.
To load the people with enormous taxes would
be wicked and impolitic, and for this there is 110
need. In foine future numbers of this paper, I
shall endeavor to point out the means of doing
such jnftice to the public creditors, that if reason
able men, they will feel thenifelves contented,
without a burden on the people half as heavy as
they have borne. At present I will mention a
number of national benefits to be derived from the
public debt, if managed wifely. There are very
few instances in which an individual can be bene
fited by credit, beyond his present ability to pay ;
but Wvth a nation the cafe is different. Great Bri
tain lies under the lieavieft debt of any nation on
earthâand this very debt hath in a number of
instances been the means of Iter prefcrvation, by
interesting rich subjects to afford their aid, w'hen
110 other could be obtainedâthey advanced new
sums to preserve those national funds, in which
they had a great property already vested.
Tlii) we hope America will never have need to
profit by her debt in this way, there are other ad
vantages she may derive. A public debt is a band
of union, and interests a powerful and opulent
class of citizens tofupport the government under
which it is contracted. An increase of transfer
able property is another advantage which may be
derived from the national debt. Commerce, ma
nufactures, and the conveniencies of life, require
that a certain proportion of property be of such a
uature as may be easily negociated or transferee!
from man toman. Of this kind are articles of
barter, gold and silver coin, and bills of credit.â
TodeteVmins exactly how great a proportion of
:his kind of property would be a public advantage
is impossible. Many of the belt judges imagine
that the whole national debt, upon a proper estab
lishment, 'would not be too great for this extensive
and growing country. There has been a specieS
as transferal commonly called speculating in pub
lic securities, which is but a kind of gaming, and
is attended with 110 advantage to the State
:his hasarifen not as much from an undue quanti
ty, as from a distrust of public faich, and a want
offyftetfi in the finance of the Union, and of par
ticular States.âLet this debt be funded in honor
mdjuftice, and it will foonhave a regular value,
:lie transferal will no longer be the work of fpe
rulators, but take place between citizens of ano
ther character, the commercial and the induftri
sus, as their own interest may require, and thus
become an immense ftockfor the benefit of trade
md manufactures. The true interest of agricul
ture and commerce naturally embrace each other,
and in the state of this country cannot be fepera
ted. All clalfes of citizens have right to protec
tion for thenifelves and their property; but if
there be anyone which hath the best claim to be
regarded in public measures, it is the American
Farmers, as they constitute the most numerous
part of the people. The national debt may be so
funded as to produce great consequential advan
tages to the F artnersâand prove the means of their
procuring a much better price for their produce
and raw materials, than can otherwise be expect
ed. So far as relates to the present question, a
landed property may be considered as fixed, and
not transferable. 111 anew country, and where
land is cheap as in the United. States, the inhabi
tants when they have power to do it, will reft their
property in solid foil. The produce of the Farm
ers land is loose and transferable property, and.
that it may bear a just price, it is neceflary there
should be an equal quantity of property within
the community, in such a situation that it may be
commanded to make pay to the farmer, for the
fruit of his toil.
The produce of the country and our raw ma
terials for manufactures, will always command a
just price in some part of the world ; and it is the
business of commerce to collect and tranfporc
them to the place in which they are wanted.
If foreigners are under the neceffityof coming
to us and collecting the articles they need, the
price received by the farmer will be limited as
they please. Make the supposition that one half
the property now in commerce within the UnitcJ
States, were to be annihilated ; tho' our produce
might bear the fame price in the markets of EuÂ»
rope, it would probably diminish the home price
one third. The purchasers would be fewâthe
markets would be over stockedâthe produce of
your farms being in its nature perishable, must
be soon vended, and the remaining half of com
mercial property would command out of your
hands, nearly the fame quantity of produce, as
the whole would have done,if preserved. In this
cafe the loss would be as sensibly felt by the far
mers as by the merchant. It Ls always the cafe in
a new and agricultural country, that the trans*ferable property is in too fniall quantity for the
advantage ot' tliofe who hold and till the ground.
At present tlie principal of the national debt can
not be paid, but with a little honeity and policy
it may be placed in a situation fafe for the credi
tors and beneficial to all clad'es of citizens.
For the benefit of the agricultural interest, 1
would not witfi the debt to be annihilated, if it
were confident with jultice. Let it be honellly
funded, it mull remain in its nature transferable,
and will be animmenfe bank for all kinds of bufi
jiefs. The situation of the United Statesis such,
your agriculture so extensive and increasing, and
the quantity of yourprodace so great, that unless
by fomepolicy of this kind you fixa certain quan
tity of property in its nature negociable, the mar
ket will be overltocked, and the loss will in the
end be borne by the farmer.
Suppose the surplus produce of a farmer be
yond his own consumption, to equal one hundred
bulhels of wheat. If there be a jult proportion
of negociable property, each bu/hel will be worth
five (hillings ; but if this proportion be a little
leflened, eachbufhel will command only four (hil
lings- and the whole loft to the farmer will be
five pounds ; which is a sum four times so great
as he need to pay in taxes, to place the whole
American debt on honorable funds. To execute
this bufinels, honesty, and great abilities are re
quiliteâthe new treasury department promifcs
you both, and I make no doubt but the debt we
have lamented, will soon be a great national ad
vantage.
PARIS, August 29.
M. Neckar's Memorial to the National Aftmbly on
Thursday lajl, on the J]ate of the finances and the
success oj the loan of thirty Millions.
NATIONAL ASSEMBLY, AUGUST 27.
The deliberations of the Afleinbly wefe inter
rupted by the reading of M. Neckar's Memorial,
the heads of which are as follow:
The Minister announces the little success which
the loan has met with hitherto, the subscriptions
of which to the present day amount only to two
millions lix hundred thousand livres.
The causes which he afligns for the bad success
of it are,
The reduction of the interest to 4 and a half
per cent, instead of j per cent, as he proposed.
The retrenchment of some of the conditions of
it, favorable to the lenders.
And forgetting to mark the periods of its reim
bursement, as well as to pay the proper honorary
compliment to the lenders, for their patriotic
zeal in making advances to the public Treasury
from their own funds.
M. Neckar then proposes to give up this loan
of 30 millions, and open another of 80 millions,
at 5 percent, reimbursable in ten years, one tenth
every year:âthis loan to be advanced by the lend
ers, one half in ready money, the other in con
tracts of the ancient public debt now becoming
due, which is to bear a like interest of 5 per cent.
The Minister thinks that this accommodation
of converting old contracts into new ones, feeing
the loss the former are daily experiencing on the
public exchange, will ensure the fuccel's of this
loan of 80 millions, and bring 40 millions of rea
dy money into the Treasury.
He lays before the Allembly the neceflity of
supporting public credit, which loses daily very
rapidly from the loss which the revenues of the
State fuffer from the unfortunate situation of Go
vernment. But he is of opinion that this credit
jnay be kept up by the public labors of the Aflem
blyonthe confederation of the Finances.
M. Neckar further announces the derangement
which exists in some of the provinces in collecting
the fait duties, and proposes to the Allembly to fix
the price of (alt at fix sous the pound ; he thinks
that notwithstanding this loss at fir ft fight of 3c
millions annually 011 the produce of this tax, the
increased consumption of this article, and the
diminution of expcncesin preventing the contra
band tradeofit, willtendgreatly tolellen thislofs.
The Bilhop of Autun supported M. Neckar in
every particular ; he spoke a confidcrable time,
and with much fatisfatftion to his hearers, 011 the
nature and importance of the national credit;
he pointed out 1110 ft clearly the neceflity of sup
porting it, by declaring that the public debt and
the interest of it never ought to be fubjeift to anj
reduction, even inafked under the titlcofimpofmg.
He concluded by demanding,
1 ft. That the Allembly fliould admit a loan of
80 millions, leaving the terms of it to the execu
tive power.
2d. That it fliould publifii a declaration confirm
ing its former decrees, which place the creditors
of the State under the protection of the honor and
loyalty of the nation, which it fliould be
formally announced that the public debt can ne
ver be fubjedt to any reduction.
3d. The establishment of a Committee of twelve
Members, who are to act in concert with the Mi
nisters in rcftoring the finances, and who fliall
make their report four times a week to the Na
tional AHeinbly, who are to deliberate on the
means of re-eftablifhingtlie finances, and propor
tioning the rcceipt to the expenditure.
4th. The formation of provincial atlemblies.
The Aflembly only took the two firll articles of
the Bifliop of Autun's motion into consideration,
which were,
To acknowledge the loan of 80 millions; and,
to pais a folenm decree, which shall pronounce
that the public debt can never befubjecft to any re
duction.
These two articles were vehemently attacked
by some Members, but victorioully defended by
M. Chapelier, Count de Mirabeau, Due. de Lian
court, and the Archbilhop of Aix.
One of the deputies of Tourraine acquainted
the AHembly of the patriotic intentions of the
principal citizens of that province aflenibled at
Tours. They have voted a voluntary fubferip
tion to raise a patriotic fund by anticipation of the
amount of the taxes of the firft fix months of this
year, and have agreed that those of the year 1790
(hall be equally anticipated and paid every month
in advance ; that the more affluent citizens have
resolved to make advances for those wliofe fortunes
will not permit them to make like facrifiees.
They have besides opened another fubfeription
fund ; where gratuitous benefactions, and volun
tary fubferiptions, in favor of the country are paid
by those citizens who wiih to contribute above the
ordinary taxes of the country.
The city of Tours has communicated its inten
tions to other cities and commonalties of the pro
vince, and this patriotic zeal has had the mofl
happy effect throughout the province. It further
petitions the Aflembly to fandtion its intentions
by a public decree, cloathcd with the Royal Au
thority, and inviting the other provinces of the
kingdom to imitate its example.
Oneof the deputies of Normandy said, that the
city of Rouen wished to acl in the fame manner.
The Aflembly then voted the public thanks to
the province of Tourraine, and ordered a copy of
its resolutions to be sent to all parts of the kingdom.
August 28. The firft article of the new form
of the constitution, aspropofed by M. Meunier the
preceding day was then read, which is as follows :
" The French Government is a monarchical
Government. There is no authority in France fu
periorto the law. The King only reigns through
it, and when he does not command in the name
of the law, he cannot command obedience."
Yellerday [Friday] the public funds rose near
two per cent, inconsequence of what pafled in the
National aflembly on Thursday.
LONDON, August 25.
The Hiltory of the Decline of the Roman Em
pire is not read ar court, tho it Hands in the roy
al library, ornamented in superb binding. The
introduction of indecent and profane paflages,
have given offence to an illustrious ladyâand in
deed, it mult be confefled, there are feveral,both
in the learned languages and in English, which
a delicate man could not read in the hearingofa
inodeft woman.
Father O'Leary, the celebrated Irish Roman
Catholic Priellâhe who told a Bifliop, who ridi
culed purgatoryâ" Your Lord/hip may gofarthtr
and fare worse"âis preparing a criticism on the
above work, so far as it relates to the conduct of
the church.
Although deprived of fight, Lord North is not
blind to intellectual enjoyments. When disen
gaged from conversation, of which he is ltill the
life, his Lordship is generally employed inliften
iiig to his daughters, who read the English and
French Classics to him by turns. Thus surround
ed by his own family, and drawing com fort from
the resources of a highly cultivated mind, this
Nobleman, by some deemed unhappy on account
of the " painful visitation of Heaven," now en
joys more real felicity, than when he directed the
counf'els of a great nation, and governed England
by his nod.
America is making ample strides, and the ap
pointment of Mr. Washington to the office of
Chief Magiflrate, was a meafurethe mofl condu
cive to that end. Her empire, in course of time,
mull: be great and rei'pectable indeed !
Her sea coaits are two thousand miles in extent,
with bays, and rivers, like seas, to ten times that
extentâwith many great harbors, and other pla
ces of security for great ffiips in the middle and
northern provincesâwith vafl fifheries in those
bays and rivers on the sea coafls, and access to still
greater to the north, to thefouth, and to the east
of their dominionsâwith seas, except in one or
two places, open all the year round to give con
tinual employment to the seamen, and with no
enemies near to those States tocontroul them.
Many contract debts through vanity or intem
perance or borrow money, or rake up goods,
with the intention of thieves 01* robbers, never to
make return.âWhen such fuffer, they fufFer de
servedly, in expiation of their guilt. But there
are unavoidable damages by water, by fire, by
the crush of power, oppressive landlords, 'and
more oppressive lawsuitsâdeath of cattle, failure
of crops, failure of payment in othersâwith thou
sands of luch like casualties, whereby men may
become bankrupt, and yet continue blameless â
And, 111 all such cases, one would think that the
present ruin was fufficient calamity, without the
exertionof law, and the confinement of a ja.il to
make that ruin irreparable.

own purposes by evading a compliance with the
molt neceflary regulations, and refufing their
proportion of supplies for the public exigencies.
A refra<flory spiritâa departure fromfirft princi
plesâand the want of general fidelity, lead to a
multiplication of lawsâincrease of officersâand
of those whom the public lupportâThefe increase
the burthens of society, and lead many to doubt
the eligibility of civil government to a state of
nature. âA due sense of the maxim contained in
the motto, would prevent these evils in a great
degree, forifevery man was confcientiousindif
charging his public duty, whether in office, or
out of office, government would have an easy
operation âits benefits would be co extensive with
its influences âand universal fatisfaCtion would
be the happy consequence.

PL A ISTER OF PARIS.
Copy of a letter from Robert Morris to Jesse
Lawrence.
AFTER the conversation which palled between
thee and me, on the subject of Plaifter of
Paris, I conceived it might not be improper to
give thee an account ot the several trials which I
have made wit hit as a manure for land. Perhaps
it might have been in the year i 775 that it was
recommended to me as a manure for land; I ac
cordingly purchased five bulhelsâyet my faith
therein was so weak, that it lay until when
in the month of March I sowed at the rate of 2 1-2
bushels per acre, on Tome ground which I had til
led and sowed with clover feed the l'pring pieced
ing, leaving a piece in the middle not Towed, and
likewise on each fule. That season, where there
was no plaifter sown, the clover flood on the groud
about twelve inches high, but where the plaiftei
was sown, the clover flood upon an 34
inches high ; this ground 1 sowed tor about loui
seasons after, and found it to have lefsgrafa eveiy
year, though that which wasfownwith the plan
ter had as much more in proportion as the fult
year. I afterwards ploughed up all this ground
except one fourth ot an acre, upon this 1 again
put plaifter of Paris in the year 1 785, and no o
ther manure whatever since i77"> and it is now
in much better order than it was at that time, and
it has produced me about two tons of hay every
year for the firft crop, and a tolerable good second
crop, and some times a third crop, or verj good
past.ire ; though the lall time I manured it 1 put
in the proportion of fix bulhels ot this plailtei to
an acre. 1 have likewise made many experiments
otherwise ; I have tried it with Indian corn, w ' lel Â®
it does tolerably well, with buckwheat, ana it
makes it grow so rapidly that it-has always fallen
down, and I have loft my crop. 1 h ave tneÂ«l it
with wheat, and iti" not polfible to dilcover that
it makes any difference when sown 011 the crop ,
bat when it is sown on grass gi'ounu, and t n->
ground turned up and laid down in wheat, ic is
amazing the advantage it is of to the crop. Latt
fall was a year I put down about 8 acres ot wheat,
which I harrowed in and then lowed clover feed,
which came up and looked very fine in the tall ; hut
the winter being very severe, with but little snow,
the clover was dead in the spring ; when 1 lowed it
again with clover feed, and about 6 buihels ot plail -
ter of Paris to the acre ; and by har veil time I had
clover all over the piece better than 12 inches high,
and which I mowed in about two or three weeks
after my wheat was cut ; I believe 1 might have
cut full a ton of hay oft" from each acre, and I am
well fatisfied that if I had not put plailter of Pa
ris on it I should not have had any grass that I
could have cut. I have likewifefold this manure
to many people in this State as well as New-Jersey,
Maryland, Delaware, &c. and after trial their
applications to me for more has been very great,
which induces me to believe they have found the
like benefit frointhe use of it as I have myfelf.
With refped:, I am thy friend.
ROBERT MORRIS.
Philadelphia, February IJ, I 789.
To JESSE Lawrence.
I, ClementÃiddle, lilq. Notary Public for the Commonwealth
of Pcnnfvlvaaia, duly commiffiontd and qualified, do certify, that
Robert Morris, miller and farmer, of the county ot Philadelphia,
by whom the foregoing writiug certified by him in his own hand
writing to me well known, is a person of good character and re
putation, and that t have been (s*l his farm and have leen great
appearance of improvement in the produce thereof from the uic of
platffer of Paris, and am of opinion that credit is due to his certifi
cate before written relative thereto. The said plailter is brought
from Nova Scotia, and is in great repute.
In tetlimony whereof, 1 have hereunto set my hand and fixed

ODE on the DEATH oj a YOUNG LADY.
[from mr. locan's foems.]
UNTIMELY gone ! for ever fled
The roses of the cheek so red*
Th' affe&ion warm, the temper mild,
The sweetness that in sorrow fmil'd.
Alas ! the cheek where beauty glow'd,
The heart where goodnefsoverflow'd,
A clod amid the valley lies,
And " dust to dufi" the mourner cries.
0 from thy kindred early torn,
And to thy grave untimely borne *
Vanifti'd forever from my view,
Thou sister of my foul, adieu !
Fair with my firft ideas twin'd
Thine ima oft will meet my mind ;
And, while remembrance brings thee near,
AiF<6lion fad will drop a tear.
How oft does sorrow bend the head.
Before we dwell among the dead !
Scarce in the years of manly prime,
1 've often wept the wrecks of time f
What tragic tears bedew the eye !
What deaths we fuifer ere we die !
Our broken friend {hips we deplore,
And loves of youth that are no more !
No after-friendfli p e'er can raise
Th'endearments of our early days :
And ne'er the heart such fondnels prove.
As when it firft. began to love.
Afl'ection dies, a vernal flower ;
And love, thebloll'omof an hour !
The fprins of fancy cares controul,
And mar the beauty of the foul.
Vers'd in the commcrcp of deceit,
How soon the heart forgets to beat!
The blood runs rold at int'refVscall,
They look with equal eyes on all.
Ye pow'rÂ« ! whatever ye withhold,
I t my afieÂ£iiÂ«Â»n ne'er grow old ;
Ne'er may the human glow depart,
Nor nature yield to frigid art!
Still may my generous bosom burn,
Tho' doom'd to bleed o'er beauty's urn ;
And still the friendly face appear,
Tho' moiften'd witn a tender tear!

NEW-YORK, NOVEMBER 7.
Thurfdav nooh aFire broke out in anew lioufe
of Mr. Hollar, in Crown-street, oppoiite the Dutch
Church, which was not exringuiihed till the build
ing was cSnfiderably damaged.
l'his ati'ords another iniiance of the expert
nelsoi* our engine men, and the alacrity wiih
which all clafies of citizens turnout, to render
their alfiltance. Ahlio tliefe circumftaiices may
inspire confidence in the minds of people at large,
a misfortune is not the less dreadful and inju
rious to the unfortunate f'utferer. Ft is reasona
ble to conclude, therefore, that every prudent
proprietor of houses will avail himfclt of every
probable means to place his property out of jeo
pardy.
His Excellency William Livingstoh, Esq. of Elitabcth
town, has been re-eleÂ£tcd Governor o( New-Jcrfey, by the legi
slature of that Stale, now convened at Perth-Amboy.
On Tuesday the Federal Court tor the diltrift t.f New-\ ork,
was opened in the ExchangeâH.s Honor Judge Duanej
tiding: No bufmefs before the Court, the fame was imme
diately adjolrned.
It has been observed, refpetfting the Revolu
tion of America, that so extraordinary were the
leading features in this great work, that, unlike
the origin of other nations, America sprang into
empire arid eminence at once.âlt may, with pro
priety, befaid of her, that " A nation was born
in a Day."âEven our enemies will hardly allow
us a nonageâfor altho from our inexperience in
government and finance, errors may very natur
ally be expected, yet our miltakes have had no
quarter from themâWe have been mercilouily
satirized on the one hand, and our conference
depreciated 011 the otherâand to this day, there
arc not wanting those, who snarl at our growing
credit, power, and refpetftability âwho pretend
to be friends to the country, but whose envy is ex
cited at every fympton of national dignity and
honor.
Notwitliftanding all that has been, or may
said, to alarm the public mind 011 the subject ot
our national, and Stare debts, it is undoubtedly a
fact, that America is in a more eligible lituation
in this refpevft, than any cf the States and King
doms of the European world. Our capacity to
discharge both principal and interest, bears a
greater relative proportion to the whole amount
of our debts, than the refourcesof any other ci.
vifized country : This appears from an inveltiga
tion of the fubjedlâconfequently, there never
can exist the shadow of areafon for lacrificing the
public faith, by any iniquitous fchemesof depre
ciation.âThe path of honor and lionefty is a plain
pathâlll that we shall be fafeâand as happinefa
whether of a public or private nature, is therefult
of labor and enterprizeâfo, a determination to
do justly may require extra exertions, yet the point
gained, the* public credit reltored, and a perfjtt
confidence established in the government, our re
ward will be greatâWe (hall be prepared for
every event âand realizing the bleflings ofcha
ratfer, credit, and fidelity, every future plan of
temporary knavery will be rejetfted with abhor
rence.
Of all the imps that are permitted to torment
mankind, there is not one which pofleiles such
extensive powers as that of envy :âEvery person
profefles todefpife its influence, and yet too ma
ny feel the force of its malignanceâthe favorites
of fortune are theconftantobjetfls of itspnrfuitâ
the prosperity and liappinefs of a cotemporary
feed its venom, and give a scope to its poisonâ
it pines, and lickens at the success of a rival âand,
tho generally disappointed in all its projeifts, it
thiives, and seems to acquire new vigor from
the chagrin confequcnt upon defeat to its wishes
and desires âIts belt offices are detraction and
revengeâlts obje*sts of calumny are merit in eve
ry grade of lifeâ-abilities and desert, attratft its
reproaches and contempt âand when success at
tends a virtuons enterprize, when meritorious
characters are promoted, this demon always as
signs some bafeand detestable cause, for the tri
umph.â Envy is a raoft industrious little devilâ
it not only aflails those in exalted stations, but
descends to the minutise of lifeâit afl'umes the
character of umpire in every cafe that comes
within its knowledgeâand supplying the defici
ency of taste and judgment by a brazen front, it
condemns with confidence what it does not com
prehend, or what may contravene its own pre
conceived ideasâThus it perpetually torments
the bosom where it resides, and mars the liappi
nefs of all that falls in its wayâbut the wife and
virtuous, while they avoid the society of envious
fnarlers, conscious of the retftttude of their own
hearts, are borne along through life, fuperiorto
their chagrin, their malice or their calumny.

Economy is a matter of experienceâthe con
versation and advice of a friend may be highly
advantageous to the young, who need inftruo
tion. rhe principle of julticeis unfolded, and
the pra&ice of it eltabliflied by the communica
tions and approbation of one in whom they con
fideâNext to the testimony of a good conscience
in our favor, the testimony of a friend is the belt
defence against unjuftifiable compliances with,
pernicious customs âThe secrecy which some af
fecit with regard to their affairs, declining all
communications on the lubjed:, often leads to
distress which timely counsel might have prevent
ed.
There are falfe, but plausible maxims, which
a friend might unmalkâthere are propensities,
seemingly generous, which he might check
there are confcquences which he might forefee,
and in the spirit of meekness foretel ; there isÂ®
lenfeof justice at the bottom of the heart, which
he might roufe,and provoke to break through eve
ry obltacle.â" Faithful (in this sense) are the
wonndsof a friend"âHappy is the young wan
who is favored with a friend, whose penetration
may prove a lamp to his feet, and a guide to his
path.â
There is a magnanimity of spirit in g> v '"S>
and receiving advice which few poflefs ; but h c
other virtues may be acquired.
