THE TABLE T. No. LXI.
" When men art certain that the truth of a thing
is not to be known, they "will alio ay s differ, and endea
vor to ivipofe on one anothtr."
THOUGH men difputefor the purpose of
ascertaining truth, yet there are few
men who find less of it, than those who dispute
acreat deal. The habit of disputation is a dan
gerous one. It creates fucha love oi triumph that
jnen acquire a dexterity of handling unintelligible
subjects, with a view only toconqueft. By this
means, eager disputants abandon the plain paths
of reason and truth, and wander into the fields of
imagination and conjecture. When men confine
their investigations to such points as admit of de
monstration, he who takes the light fide of the
quellion will, with equal abilities, put liisadver
fary to silence. The fubjetft will be ltripped of
all adventitious glare, and the light of truth will
ihine confpicuouily over error and sophistry. But
those, who dispute merely from the love of such
a practice, know too well that they ihould have
very little to do with reason and common sense.
It ihould be their main objeeft to elude the argu
ments of other people by the refinements of art
and evasion.
Discussion is no doubt an important medium of
inveiligating truth. It opens a spirit of enquiry
in the world, and excites, in cool, disinterested
men, a desire of coming at the real knowlege of
i'uch things, as are capable of being known. The
warm diiputants, however, only start the game.
The acquilition falls to men of candor and impar
tiality, who take the right track, and often over
take their objedt. It is easy to observe that the
rnoft violent disputes, that prevail among men, are
of such a nature, as cannot be reduced to a certain
ty. Many points of disputation are invelopedin
such unkown or remote contingencies, as elude
all the powers of investigation. After all the
discussion that can be had on foine subjects, truth
â¢will keep out of fight, and the point of debate
remain undetermined. If men however ma
nage their altercations with good humor and mo
deration, some benefit will result from them.â
Discussion gives scope to the imagination and ha
bituates the reasoning faculty to a dexterity in its
procefles.
No reflects more diflionor on hu
man nature, than the ill-will and persecutions,
that have been instigated by such disputes, as are
not only unimportant in tliemfelves, but utterly
incapable of being demonstrated- The periods
ofecclefiaftical contention draw over the charac
ter of man some of its darkest fliades. To a per
fbn of a liberal mind, it feemsan incredible thing
that a useless quellion, unattended with any ra
tional data of solution should throw whole cities,
dilVritfts and countries into broils, persecutions,
and wars.
Though a free fjjirit of enquiry iliould at all
times be tolerated, I would still recommend it to
prudent individuals to have little conneiftion with
those, who have the principal management of dis
putes. They are not the men, from whom truth
flows with purity and force. It is easy to per
ceive, that the originator of any system or ques
tion; will be apt to commence his enquiries with
an aim to victory. Truth is no further to be re
garded in his pursuit, than as it coincides with the
favorite doctrine under examination. The sys
tem must not yield to the dictates of reason j but
whenever they come in competition, reason must
be facrificed to system.
Lovers of altercation are not only to be ihunned
as bad guides in our researches after truth, but as
troublesome allbciates and dangerous friends. A
warm partizan eilimates the merit of his acquain
tance according as lie promotes or defeats the
fchcines he has in contemplation. As these
fche.mes generally will be wrong, his friend 111 ufl
either quarrel with him or participate iii his er
rors and quarrels.

WEDNESDAY, November ir, 1739
that in any war hereafter the following descrip
tions of men should be undisturbedâhave the pro
tection of both fides, and be permitted to follow
their employments in security, viz.
1. Cultivators of the earth, because they labor
for the fubfifte nee of mankind.
0. Fiflieriren, for the fame reason.
3. Merchants and Traders, in un-armedJhipsâ
who accommodate different nations by communi
eating and exchanging the nefceilaries and con
veniences of life.
4. Artilts and mechanics, inhabiting and work
ing in open towns : It is hardly neceilary to add,
that the hospitals of enemies ihould be tinmoleft
edâthey ought to be alliiled. It is for the inter
est ofhutnanity ill general, that the occasions of
war, and the inducements to it ihould be diminish*
ed. II rapine is aboliilied, one of the encourage
ments to war is taken away, and peace therefore
more likely to continue and be lasting.
The practice of robbing merchants on the high
seas, a remnant of the ancient piracy, tho it may
be accidentally beneficial to particular persons,
is far from being profitable to all engaged in it,
or tothe nation that authorises it : In the begin
ingof awar fomerich iliips, notupon their guard,
are surprized and takenâThis encourages the
firft adventurers to fit out more armed vefiels,
and many others to do the fame : But the enemy
attlie fame time become more carefulâarm their
merchant ihips better, and render them not so
easy to be taken ; they go also more under the
protection of convoys : Tlius, while the priva
teers to take them are multiplied, the veflels fub
jeCtto be taken, and the chances t>f profit, are di
miniihed, so that many cruises are made wherein
the expences overgo the gainsâand as it is the
cafe in other lotteries, tho particulars have got
prizes, the mass of adventurers are losers, the
whole expence of siting out all the privateers
during a war, being much greater than the whole
amount of goods taken.
Then there is the national loss of all the labor
of so many men, during the time they have been
employed in robbingâwho besides spend what
they get in riot, drunkenness and debaucheryâ
lose their habits ofinduftryâare rarely fit for any
foberbufinefs after a peace, and serve only toin
creafe the number of highwaymen and lioufe
breakers.âEven the undertakers who have been
fortunate, are by sudden wealth led into expend ve
living, the habit of which continues, when the
means of supporting it cease, and finally ruins
them A just punifliment for their having wan
tonly and unfeelingly ruined many honest, inno
cent traders and their families, whose substance
was employed in serving the common interest of
mankind. B. F.
THE OBSERVER. No. IV.
The people have fi/jjtred an'tmmenfe sum by the deran
ged /late of the national debt.
AFTER all that the public have fuffercd by the
confufion of finance in the union and seve
ral states, it is not strange that their patience is
nearly exhausted. The want of a general go
vernment hath cost millions to the people, which
are now very happily lhared and enjoyed among
a let of people who have been very Icrupulous
about liberty, the collectors of the taxes you have
paid, and speculators in your disordered funds.
It is time the truth fliould be fairly spoken to
the people at large, and the Observer will do it
whatever may be the consequence. Some of the
fame scrupulous people now wish to play over the
old game, and fill you with jealousies that they
may have a second liarveft ; but \heir day ispali.
For our ownprefervation it is neceflary we should
attendto the sources of pad confufion. By the
national debt I mean all those funis which the
union at large, and the particular States Hand
obligated to pay. Tliefe funis were incurred in
one common cause, Our defence in the general
warâit was chance and not option which fixed
men's names to the lift of Continental or State
creditors.
The general idea is a true one, that the whole
must stand or fall together, and most people had
little preference to either kind of fecurily. There
is not at present any reason in equity why one
class of creditors Ihould be prefered to the other
âthe whole ought to stand 011 the fame funds,
and have equal justice. Soon after the war a new
constitution of government was found neceflary
to set things right, but at that juncture the coun
try was not fufficiently enlightened to obtain it.
The consequence was, the continent without any
power of creating funds, began in a desultory
manner to arrange their own finances. The
several Statesfinding the weakness of the union,
began to make partial arrangements for that very
..debt, which 011 every principle of justice ought.
f Publijhed on Wednesday and Saturday .J
to be fuftainedby the whole iiation. Such reme
dies as tliefe, adopted by different bodies of men,
and at distant places and very different tinies,
mull in their nature be different and confafed.
From this source yoti have feeri more than fifty
i kinds of paper securities, at one time, within
the United States, differing but a small matterin
lvalue, but enough to spread confufion over the
whole, and betray the honell into the hdnds of
designing men. The people liavfe paid enough
to make the creditors had it come to
their hands ia a regular and equal method ; but
in the midst of this darkness nothing has been ef
fected. The members of the old Congress, and
of your aflemblies, were men of. wisdom, but
what conld wisdom do in such different and dis
tant bodies, which had no conllitutional connec
tion, and of course conld have no general system.
Matters of this kind cannot be planned in a nu
merous body of men, be they erer so wife. A
treasury board of proper convpafs, system atically
arranged, and furniflied with information, mult
concert ; and the legiflatnre after proper discus
sions mult give the authority to executc.
The firft flep towards order and light is to re
duce the whole national debt to one kind, and
onefetof regulations, and unless something of
this nature takes place, you have millions more
to pay without coming any nearer to the desired
end. It is impossible that a plain man, who is an
industrious and good fubjecft, should diftinguifli
between so many kinds of taxes of different val
ues. I.et the whole sum of this debt be brought
togetherâplaced on common and fiinilar funds,
and regularity introduced to the businessâthe
public will then know their fitnationâthirty men
will do that business for the whole union which
now employs thro' the fe-.'eral States two hun
dred and fifty, all of whom are supported by the
peopleâThe creditors will understand a plain and
honest plan, and be saved from a thousand iin
pofitionsâtaxes will be of one kind, andtheman
who purchases to pay them will know the price
he ought to give. I can forefce there will |be
objections to wliat I advance, and fomevery cun
ning men will cry danger ! danger ! but I never
yet saw any evil from Amplifying money matters,
where all the people have to pay. It is the roll
ing up together of a number of half madefyfteins,
which endangers the people ; for they cannot fee
thro' them, and the man that mufl borrow his
neighbours wits to manage his own affairs, mufl
soon borrow money to pay his debts. The pre
sent is a fortunate moment for this country, and
the only one they will ever have to Amplify their
treasury matters. , Let one great ana inclusive
system for the whole be adopted, and your finan
ces may soon be reduced to perfect order. Should
the present bpportunity be past and the federal
system not takfc in the whole of your national
clebt, another opportunity uiuft not be expected
âconfufion will continueâ- the poor and unsus
picious will be cheatedâjealousy will pervade all
orders of citizensâthere will be no public faith,
and your monied men will hide their property â
a liable medium for business will be severely want
edâand your future agriculture, manufactures
and commerct, be denied that spring which
might now be givfeh them.
P. S. In the second number of this paper, some
observations were made, on the compensation, the gen
tlemen oj Congress have voted themfelves âI think th:
public mind mufl be easy on this fubjeCi, when it is un
der flood that the pay they have taken, is not greater
than was allowed by the State assemblies to the mem
bers of the eld Congressâtake the State of Connec
ticut for an exampleâThe atfembly of this State until
May 178 7, allowed their delegate/ three dollars per
diem and their expencesâthe expences of the delegates
were different and from two to four dollars per diem
âprobably the average of expences was three dollars,
which added to the compensation for services, makes
the sum now given to the Representatives. Since May
1787, the aljembly of ConneClicut have allowed five
dollars per diem for service and expences. The al
lowance given by Connetticut, was much smaller than
in most of the other Statesâl am informed that the a
verage allowance made, by the\affemb'lies of the thirteen
States to their delegates, used to be eight dollars per
diem, nearly, one fourth more than the gentlemen have
allowed themfelves âthe members might then if they
pleased, take a feat and continue under pay the whole
year ; now it will be but a small part of the yearâ
then they might leave Congress when private business
called them ; now they are constrained by authority to
be present, let their own concerns be ever so urge?.t
âthen they 7night and actually did hold offices of pro
fit under their own States ; now it is the popular sense
they should .7at, and many in confeauence have made
a great facrifice. These fatts mufl jujlify the prefect
comper Cation.
\ From the AMERICAN MERCURY."]LONDON, August 15.
In Germany an excellent and clieap dye has
been invented, adapted to woolen and cotton ma
nufactures ; it consists chiefly of the feeds of the
red Trefoil, a plant very common in this coun
try, and employed to feed horses, &c. A decoc
tion of these feeds is mixed withdifFerent mineral
jubilances, and the dyes produced are very beau
tiful, and of a great variety; amongst which are
yellows and greens of different shades, as also cit
ron and orange colours. These dyes reiiit the ac
tion of the substances with which trials are ufu
â¢ally made much better than common dyes, and
promise many advantages, if adopted, to the
manwfatftures of this country.
Some days before the taking of the Baftile, the
King laid to the Duke of Orleans, who had come
to pay his Majesty a vifuâ" You dffire my head
you are a iecond Cromwellâretire from my
presence." The Duke bowed, and obeyed, only
faying as he weut out, " In a fewdaysyour Ma
}esty will have a more just opinion of my charac
ter. You will be better informed." Since which
his Majesty has aiked the Duke's pardon.
Almost every letter from America, is full of the
poverty, distress, and misery of her citizens, and
several well informed Republicans do notfcruple
to aflert, that one of the firft a<fts of the fede
ral Government must and -will certainly be, an
earnest application to Great Britain for some small
jhare in the Wett-lndia commerce, the loss of
which the Americans now feel, with the molt
painful regret. ( A lieâpaid for.)
St. JOHN's, (Antigua) September 8.
WE are informed by a correspondent, that the
unfortunate Count Lowendahl, who, in a fit of
pailion, lately (hot his servant in Paris, for some
frivolous neglecft, was condemned to have his
head cut off, and that the sentence has been exe
cuted.
The King, understanding the sentence was to
be carried intoeffed: in a few hours, shut himfelf
up in his closer, and would admit 110 person to an
audience, till the fatal blow was given.âThus
was an end put to the life of one of the braveit
and inoft amiable men in France, and we are
sorry to observe, that the crime for which he fuf
fereddoes not permit us to lament his fate. How
unfortunate the frenzy that propelled such aman
to so dreadful an a<ftion ! He served in the late
war as Colonel Commandant of the regiment of
Arinagnac, and was third in command attheun
fuccefsful attempt made on St. Lucia, which end
ed so much to the honour of Gen. Meadows, for
his gallant repulsion of the enemy. In this ac
tion Count Lowendalil's regiment was cut almost
to pieces. His father was the famous engineer
who conducted the [liege, and carried Bergenop
zoom. It is imagined some disappointment at
play, or a love affair, had influence on his mind at
the time he committed the raih and melancholy
a<St, for which society is now deprived of so very
great a character, as this unfortunate officer was,
in every other point of view. He had the rank
of Lieutenant General at his death.
St. GEORGE's (Bermuda) Sept. ij.
Extract of a litter from a gentleman in Martinique,
to his correspondent in ibis town, dated Sept. 20.
The spirit of liberty seems to fpreacl fail here
âforty young gentlemen appeared at the last
Opera with cockades worn by the Tiers Etat in
their hats, and government did not attempt to
take any notice of it. The negroes that attempt
ed to revolt are not yet quelled entirely. A plot
truly diabolical was formed amongst the house
servants in town to poison the water jars and soup
on the fame day, which was fixed for to-morrow.
Happily it has been discovered and every poflible
precaution taken in consequence.
Another letter mentions, that one of the infer
nal contrivers of this horrid plot had been taken
with a large quantity of the deleterious ingredi
ent upon him, adofe of which he instantly fvval
lowed, that immediately put an end to his exist
ence, and prevented that severe and exemplary
death which he would otherwise have fuffered
by the hand of justice. But his body was drag
ged through the streets, and treated with every
other mark of ignominy, which detestation or
which just resentment could inspire.
CHARLESTON, O&ober 24.
A letter from the Gov. of North Carolina, to a
gentleman in this city, mentions, that from the
returns he had received of the elections for mem
bers of the Convention, the friends of the Union
might entertain themoft flattering hopes of that
State's soon adopting the Constitution.
Extraff of a letter from Augujla, Sept. 19.
Oil Tuesday evening last arrived at this place,
the Hon. Benjamin Lincoln, Cyrus Griffin, and
David Humphreys, Efq'rs, Commiflioners Plenipo
tentiary for negociating treaties with the Indian
tribes south of the Ohio, 011 their way to the
Rock Landing, to conclude the treaty with the
Creeks. Afcer some comfhunications with the
Executive, they took an early dinner with his
Honor the Governor, and proceeded about three
o'clock yetterday afternoon. From appointments
so rcfpeifta'ole and confidential, we have tlie bcfc
founded hopes of a fubltantial and jult peace, and
we feel it as a favorable feature already impreHing
in the dawnings of the new government. 1 hey
were escorted out of town byCapt Watkins, and
a number of refpecftable gentlemen.
The arrival of Gen. Lincoln in this frontier ot
the southern department has given universal plea
sure, in which he was equally distinguished by
his merits and services, under every, adverlity and
difficulty in the late war. Nothing could have
been more apt, or' so confidential as his present
appointment.
FROM THE MASSACHUSETTS CEKTINEL.
Written at the Entry of THE PRESIDENT of the
United States into the toivn ej Bojlon, Oilober 24,
1789. ,
DID human eye e'er fee so fair a day !
Behold thy Genius, Freedom ! lead the way.
Rude Kings of old did ruffian armies wait.
And swell with barb'rous port the pomp ot ftatc ;
While the proud car, bedeck'd with guilty gold,
On Fa eedom's writhing neck triumphant roll'd :
The nobles proud, who led the gorgeous train,
Wore Slavery's badge and drew a gilded chain :
While the loud shouts that piere'd the troubled air,
The tongue of nations, only trill'd with fear :
The eye adoring scarce could check its flow,
For all their trophies fwell'd on human woe.
The tracks of triumph thus the nations trod,
And thought the fov'reign power deriv'd from GOD.
Hence o'er the hilloric roll vÂ» hat hateful crimes
Were wrought the model of fuccecding times ?
Rut now fair LibertV illumes the age,
And reason tints Renown's Recording page â
Blots trom her eye the fierce barbarian's name,
And even Cctfar blurs the page of lame.
Who wrought the wond'rous change, what pow'r divine ?
The wond'roub change, O Washi ngtoh was thine !
'Tis your own jera ! grace the radient page,
The fodering Father of the filial age !
Thou too, illudrious Hancock ! by his fide
In every lowering hoilr of danger try'd,
With him conspicuous o'er the beamy page,
Dc lcend the theme ot every future age.
When fird the sword of early war we drew,
The King presaging fix'd his eye on you ;
'Twasyour dread finger prefs'd the (acred seal,
Whence rose to fov'reign power the public weal.
Then WASHINGTON, O dearly honor'd name!
From callow youth the favorite of fame!
When hov'ring navies, (haughty Albion's boast,)
Pour'd their proud armies o'er the trembling coad,
Your country beck'd you from the rural bower,
And nerv'd your mighty arm with all her power.
The tyrant saw, and uck'ning at the view,
In fancy bid his frantic hopes adieu.
But, prompt byfate, {till bad his armies dare,
Blew the vain trump and wag'd abortive war,
At length you drew the tyrant from his throne,
And bad his seal yotlr course of glory crown.
WhÂ£n polifh'd Wisdom feem'd her feats to fly,
On thee again the public cad her eye â
How rose the Model from your forming hand !
The proud palladium of our happy land !
Ah ! gentle parent of the cradled States,
On whofefond eye an infant nation waits ;
While now affection seems your step to day,
And swarming coticourfe choaks your lab'ring wayâ
Perhaps, among the loud-acclaiming throng,
Your ear may touch the Muse's transient song.
The high-born Muse, from adulation free,
Attunes, O ! CHIEF! her haughty lyre to thee.
No vulgar theme cbuld ever tempt her drain,
Perhaps the prouded of the tuneful train.
Seclude from busy life her hours are led,
And her lone deps the fliade of Science tread*
Her years revolving roll a playful flow,
Nor ever care o'erhung the Muse's brow.
From her recess,. where her own roses twine,
How oft her fancy drew a form like thine:
Ere morning wak'd,fhe wing'd her early way,
To hail the dawn of this auspicious day.
ODE to THE PRESIDENT.
By a Lady.
THE season sheds its milded ray*
O'er the blue waves the play ;
The bending harved gilds the plain,
The towering veffcls press the main :
The ruddy ploughman quits his toil,
The pallid miser leaves his spoil,
And grateful Paeans hail the (miling year,
Which bids Columbia's guardian Chief appear.
Hence! Disappointment's anxious eye,
And pale affli&ion's lingering sigh !
Let beaming Hope the brow adorn,
And every heart forget to mourn ;
Let smiles of Peace their charms display,
To grace this joy-devoted day :
And where that arm preferv'd the peopled plain*
Shall mild Contentmeut hold her placid reign.
Let " white rob'd choirs 1 ' in beauty gay,
With lucid flowrets drew the way ;
Let roses deck the scented lawn,
And Lilachs lift their purple form;
Let Domes in circling honors spread,
And wreaths adorn that glorious head ;
To thee, GREAT WASHINGTON, eaeh lyre be strung !
Thy matchless deeds by every Bard be sung !
When Freedofn rais'd her drooping head,
Thy arm her willing heroes led ;
And when her hopes, to thee refign'd,
Were reding on thy God-like mind,
How did that bread, to fear unknown 9
And feeling for her fate alone,
O'er Danger's threat'nirig form the Faulchion wield,
And tread with dauntlefsdep the crimfon'd field.
Not Dec 1 usâfor his country slain,
Not Cincinnati;?âdeathlefs name !

PHILADELPHIA, November 5.
The ladies in France are not idle fpec'tator;
of the grand revolution now accoinplifhm â¢
They have distinguished themselves not merelvbr
the love of liberty, but by their intelligence in
developing its beauties. One ofthe moftenlighi
ened elfays 011 a declaration ofthe rights of mar,
has come from the pen of the acconipliihed and
illustrious Mademoiselle de Keralio, Member of
the Academy of Arras, and of the Patriotic So
ciety of Bretons.
Extra ft of a letter frntu Grexuda, Sept. 2'l
There has been an infurret'iion in Martinique,
They have hanged and broke upon the wheel a
bove fifty ; and within thefefew days it lias been
iifcovered that the Negroes at Martinique, fay
St. Pierre, had poflefled themselves of large quan
tities of poison, and intended to poison all the
white inhabitants. It was only discovered two
days before this plot was to be put into execution.
But what is still more alarming than all this, is,
the Governor of 1 rinidad has lately publilhed an
ordinance, that all slaves coming there, or on
any of the Spanilli dominions shall be free. This
ordinance has giver- the inhabitants of this iiland
very much uneasiness, indeed so much so, that
the grand jury petitioned the Governor to call the
Legislature together, which has not yet been
done.
The alarm is such, that the inhabitants of St.
Mark's parish patrole every night from the fitting,
of the fun to the riling of it. There are two
armed veflels with soldiers on board cruising, one
to leeward, the other to windward, if poilible,
to prevent the slaves going off. From these cir
cumstances 1 leave you to judge the situation we
are in.

NEW-YORK, NOVEMBER 11.
Altlio the public is disappointed in the main
obje(ft for which the Conimiilioners went to treat
with the Southern Indians, yet, we hear, that
they have concluded a truce with them for a num
ber of months : And as the Indians in general
discovered a pacific temper, it is to be hoped that
a permanent peace may be soon fettled.
Yesterday arrived the fcliooner Jenny, Captain
Scliermehorn, from Savanna, In whom came pas
sengers, Capt. Burbeck and the whole of his
conipanyof matrofles. By the latest accounts the
Cominiltioners were at Petersburg, on their re
turn to this city.
The question for calling a convention todeli
berate on the constitution of the United States

The Legislatures of Virginia, and Pennsylva

The General Aflembly of Delaware is adjourn

The Legislature of Rhode Island has appoint
ed the 26th instant to be observed as a day of
Thanksgiving in that State.
The Supreme Executives of South Carolina and
Pennsylvania, have directed that Thursday the
26th instant be observed as a day of Thanksgiving
in those States agreeable to the Proclamation of
the President of the United States.
On Sunday next the 15th inft. a CHARITY
SERMON,wiII be preached,and a Collection made
in the forenoon, at St. George's Chapel, for the
benefit of the Charity School in this city.â
An ANTHEM, adapted to the occasion will be
sung by the Scholars.
It is really curious to hesLr some persons talk
of the liappinefs and prosperity of the United
States: If they depreciate their own government
âIf they stint their public officers to a pittance,
and treat them as menial fervantsâlf they keep
up a perpetual flame of jealousy and ill natureâ
and sow the feeds of disunion between the State
and general governments âIf they express their
approbation of their patriots by reserve and jileiicc,
Why then " the United States bid fair to fiourifh
more than any other nation upon earth, and the
people to be the happiest," butif they fondlypleafe
themselves with the idea of having the belt form
of government thatthe world hath ever knownâ
If they suppose that independency and responsi
bility should unite in their public officers, and
that they ought to honor those who have eviden
ced their wisdom and patriotifmâlf the princi
ples of confidence and union are considered asthe
foundation of peace and fecurityâlf the people
express their feelings, their refpetl and venera
tion in their mother tongue, in plain, common,
and intelligible language, for the illustrious Sa
viour ot their county âif they,in the abundance
of their gratitude, give a i'cope to their feelings
in the in oft unequivocal demoilftrations of public
affection and attachment.â" They open the door
for luxury ' âThey exhibit " the parade of fools" â
1 hey inlult thole whom they mean to honorâ
" 1 tie) dilgult the President," and violate " the
laws and constitution of their country."âWhat
jargon and inconiiftency. The truth is, the ho
nors of our country beitowed upon the govern
ment, and tliofe who aduiinifter it> are daggers to
the boforn of the envious and disappointed.
The proposition tb express our approbation of
the Prelidentof the United States, by" reserved
attention and si lent affetiion," is Itrongly tinctured
with the I urkifh policy of employing mutesâ
What! lhall we feet, and not express our feel*
ings !âlndignant idea !
" 1 lie happiness or wretchedness of human life
does not io much depend on tiie loss or acquilition
ot real advantages, as on the Hutftuating opinions
and imaginations of men." We are often in pof
leflion ot lolid blelfings without properly realizing
their nature and value : Life and liberty are too
common enjoyments to be suitably prizedâbut let
the former be endangered by a tllreatning mala
dy, or the latter wrested from us, and how alive
will our sensations be But does sickness, or
power boast a transfering influence, and render
those enjoyments valuable in their nature, which
were not always so By no meansâlt is our opin
ions, and imaginations that are hereby affetftedâ
they place objects in a different point of view, as
they are moreor less influenced by circumstances.
Did reason, and common sense always give the
tone to our fancies, and estimation, those things
which are inrrinlically eitimable, would always
appear in their proper colors : In a state of peace,
and security, and enjoying the blelfings of good
government, people are apt to grow remiss and
iufenlible of the eligibility of their lituation ; but
when the arbitrary Itrides of despotism on the
oneliand, or the intrigues of faction on the other,
threaten to disturb their tranquility, or infringe
their privileges, what different ideas immediate
ly occupy the public mind !
What are the triumphs of theCa/arj andAlexan
ders,which swell the hiltoric page, and depiift hu
man wcaknefs, ignorance and folly, compared to
the approbation of a free, and an intelligent
people, bellowed for atts of real virtue and bene
volence, on the patriots, the friends of human
kind ? The sword of America was not unsheathed
for conquest, or to extend the circle of human mi
seryâAll that was dear, and invaluable, was at
ftakeâlt was thecaule of liberty and justiceâthe
cause of virtue and humanity Heaven never
deserted such a causeâit smiled on our arms â
viitory and independence were the crown of our
enterprizesâand whatever some may now think or
fay of those who conducted our arms, who in the
midst of difficulties, dangers, and success, were
firm, intrepid, and temperateâwho united with
the befl traits of the soldier's character, the bejl
virtues of the citizenâand on all occasions paid a
sacred regard to social rights, the timeffiall come
when the full tide of applause lhall roll over their
memories, while cotemporary envy, spleen, and
disappointment, shall go down the stream of ob
livion.

PL A ISTER OF PARIS.
Copy of a letter from Mr. Henry W\nkoop, ofV reden Ho]f, Bucks County,
Pennsylvania, 13th Augujl, 1787, to the President of the Agricul
tural Society at Philadelphia.
SIR,
CONSIDERING of the utility of the Plaifter of Paris as a
grass manure, I communicate to you for the information of
the Society, an experiment which I lately made. 111 the month of
March lad, as soon as the snow -was off the ground, and it so fet
tled as to bear walking upon the furface, I spread eight bulhels of
the Plaifter of Paris upon two and a half acres of wheat stubble
ground, which had been sown the spring before (in common with
the reft of the field) with about two pounds of red clover feed
for pasture ; this spot yielded about the middle of June five tons
of hay. A small piece of ground within the enclosure, and of
similar quality, having been left unfprcad withthe plaifter,afford
ed an opportunity of diftinguilhing the effe&s of plaifter of Paris
as a manure; for from the produce of the latter, there was good
reason to judge that my piece of clover, without the afliftancc
of the plaifter, might have yielded one and a half tons of hay;
so that the eight bushels of pulverized stone must have occasioned
an increase of three and a half tons of hay upon two and a half
acres of ground, in addition to which it is now covered, to ap
pearance, with two and three tons fit for the scythe. This
foil has been in course of tillage about fifty years, and never had
any dung or manure upon it, but yet was what might be called
good wheat land. As the effects of the plaifter were thus power
ful upon such kind of ground, there is good reason to conclude
they wonld be much greater upon a foil previously manured.
With due refpeÂ£t, I am, Sec.
(Signed) HENRY WYNKOOP.
The President of the Agricultural Society in Philadelphia.
I do hereby ccrtify, that the above named Henry Wynkoop is
a person of undoubted good character and worthy of credit ; and
I do tcftify, that Plaifter of Paris is much used as a
manure in the neighborhood of Philadelphia, and that it is gene
rally held in high estimation by those who have tried it as a ma
rt it. (Signed) SAMUEL POWELL, President
of the Agricultural Society.
