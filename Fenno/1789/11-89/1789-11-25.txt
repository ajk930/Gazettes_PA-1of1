AT this important the ideas that fi|l the mind, are preg

complete the UNION of the Statesâto extend and protcÂ£l their
COMMERCE, under equal Treaties yet to formedâto explore
and arrange the NATIONAL FUNDSâto rcilore and eflablifji
the PUBLIC CREDITâand ALL under the aufpicesof an untri
ed System of' Government, will require the ENERGIES of the
Patnotsand Sasesof our CountryâHence the propriety of encreafng
the Mediums of Knowlege and Information.
AMERICA, from this period, begins a new Era in her nation
al exigenceâ"the world is all rfjore her"âThe
wisdom and follyâthe misery and prosperity ot the EMPIRES,
--STATES, and KINGDOMS, which have had their day upon
the great Theatre of Time, and are now nornore, suggest the most
important MementosâThese, witli the rapid series of Events, in
which out own Country has been so deeply intereftid, have
taught the enlifjhtmcd Citizens of the United States, that FREE
DOM and GOVERNMENTâLIBERTY and LAWS, arc inse
parable.
This Convi6Hon has led to the adoption of the New Constituti
on; for however, various the Sentiments, refpetting the ME
RITS of this System, all good mew are agreqd in the neceflitv
thatexifts, of an EFFICIENT FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.
A paper, therefore, cftabliflicd upon NATIONAL, INDE
PENDENT, and IMPARTIAL PRINCIPLESâwhich ihall
take up the prcmifed Articles, upona competent plan, it is
presumed, will be highly interesting, and meet with public ap
probation and patronage.
The Editor of this Publication is determined to leave no avenue
of informaton unexplored : âHe solicits the afliflance of Pqrfons
of leifurc and abilitiesâwhich, united with his own afliduity, he

POSTSCRIPT.
SEVEN Months have now elapsed fnce this paper *zvas ushered

adhered to, is not Jor the Editor to fayâA generous and cand'd pub
lic has awarded its approbation, by a fubfeription which is said to bt
nore extensive than ujual on similar occu/ions. âAn acknowledgement oj
the favor is therefore due from the publisher .âThe expence attending an
undertaking of this kind is always great; in the prejent inflance, it ha j
not been counterbalanced by any of the customary on account oj
advertifcmer.ts âthe object being an extensive circulation, the Editor conâ¢
ceiving that their insertion won id have count era fled that part of his plan
has never admitted an v. This cons deration if it was necejfary to bt
fuggejled,would point out the importance of punfluality on the part of tin
fubferibers âit appears to have been very generally a'tended to, as thi
Payments have been unusually prompt.
It is necejjary toobferve that the number of names which have honored
the fubfcj iption, is not fufjicientto defray the expence of the publication,
fhd to afford the Editor a competent futport, on aJ'jfpofition that tie

And when it is considered, that the paper is new in its conjiruffton ; con

THE TABLE T No. LXV.
Among the learned, there are Jome pcrfons of art
and aadreJ'Sy that can mind their lludies wtthout nes
le fling the world."
IVTEN who devote their liVes to the pursuit
of literature are apt to contract habits of
Ipleen and petulance. The effect of steady con-
to ex 'iauft the spirits, and create an
indifference for those pleasures and aniufements,
with which the bulk of mankind are captivated.
It is to be regretted that learned men fliould fall
into such an error; because it is not only detri
mental to their own happiness, but abates the fa
tisraction and advantage, that their attainments
would otherwise afford to other people.
1 he facifnating influence of literature, unless
counteracted by a diverfified intercourse with so
ciety, almost unavoidably produces pedantry of
manners.. There is perhaps no effectual remedy
againlt this inconvenience. It will be said, that
men must either lay aside their literary pursuits,
or they mull submit to the habits that grow out
of a life of study and contemplation. This idea
however fliould not be too implicitly adopted.â
The importance of a cheerful deportment, and en
gaging manners is so great and conspicuous, that
it is worth while to examine, whether they are
not more compatible, than usually happens, with
characters who are diftinguiflied for Icience and
leflection. Ihe fault lies principally with those
who have the management of youth, at the per
iod when they commence their ftudiee. Itislup
pofed eflential, by way ofexciting emulation, that
the students fliould speak in a different dialect
from other people, and alliime a style of behavior
peculiar to themselves. This practice, in a little
time, begets a pride of character, wliicli it is diffi
cult afterwards to wear off. Those lads, who on
letiting from their lludies, enter into commer
cial or other pursuits that carrj them into a vari
ety of company, may get the better of the faults
of their education, and learn to feel and act like
other people. But those, who take a profeflion
that requires a continuance in their researches
afterTcience, may retain the pride and formality
acquired at an academy, through every subse
quent period of life. After a fewyears sedentary
employment, they lose their relish for exercise and
for scenes of mirth and pleasantry, and before
they are aware of it, fall a prey to sullen, melan
choly spirits.
It is practicable, I fliould imagine, to excite an
emulation for learning, without running into the
errors I have described. Tiiere are many inftan
cesof men who combine great knowledge in the
arts and sciences with apolite addrefi and accom
modating manners. This shews that those pro
perties are not, in the nature of things, doomed
to a separation. It furnifhes like wife a strong
presumption, that it is owing to injudicious ma
nagement that they are so often separated. The
Students at an academy or university fliould be
cautioned against affectation in their language or
behavior. Pride never affunies a more (illy or a
more useless fliape, than it discovers in the'pecu
liarities of learned men. It sometimes elevates
them above an attention to those rules of propri
ety in common affairs, that are so well calculated
to render men happy and agreeable. How com
mon a thing is it, to fee men stored with rich trea
sures of knowledge, who are totally destitute of
prudence and common sense ! This is often and
in a wreatmeafureoccafioned by falfe notions im
bibed in education. The felf-fufficient student
believes it sullies his dignity to think upon such
subjects, or follow such practices as are in vogue
with the great run of mankind. He therefore
may be more learned, but he is, in reality, less
wife, less happy, and less ufeful, than those he
affects to despise.
IN HOLLAND,
The inoft flagrant violences areftill committed
by the favourers of the Stadtholder, on the patri
i otic party. âThe consequences have been mur
der, and depredations on property : And the
common order of people are so infatuated in fa
vour of the House of Orange, that the eftablilh
ment of a Defpotifm'is, an event asmuchexpedted,
as it will be easy to effecft.
IN ENGLAND,
Every thing remains tranquil. The prosperi
ty of this nation appears progreflingâ.its com
merce extendingâand we hope its liberality and
enlarged policy increasing.
THE TURKS,
Tt is said, in the German papers, have been de
feated in two pitched battles, with the loss of seve
ral thousands in each : But itis fufpevsled,that these
battles have exiltence only in the Vienna Gazette.

New-Tori, Ottober 9, 1789.
"An ADDRESS no the Prefidentof the United
States of America, was prepared agreeably to tJ"<?
resolution of Synod, and read ; which being aj~
proved of, it was ordered that the Rev. Profeflot'
Livingston, the Rev. Dr. Linn; the Rev. Mr.

Hon. Richard Var xck,EJ<j; Mr. HenbyÃoome,
and tlie Hon. John Vanderbilt, Efq; do sign
the fame, and present it to the President in tlie
name and behalf of the Synod."
1 lie Address, which was delayed, an account
of the Prelidejit's absence, was presented 011
Thursday last, and is as follows.
To the PRESIDENT of the United States,
SIR,
THE Synod of the Reformed Dutch Church,
in North America, embrace the occasion of
their annual feflion, being the firft since your ap
pointment, to present you their fincerc congratula
tions, and to join in that great and general joy
teltified by all defcriprions of citizens on your ac
ceptance of the liigheft office in the nation.
We cannot forbear expreifingour gratitude to
God for preserving your valuable life amidst so
many dangers till this time ; âfor inspiring you
with a large portion of the martial lpirit, and
forming you also for the milder and more agreea
ble arts of government and peace ; âfor endow
ing you with great virtues, and calling them into
exercise by great events; âfoi diftinguilhing you
with honors,and giving you remarkable prudence
and moderation ; âand for making your extraordi
nary talents the more conspicuous,_ ufeful, and
durable, by superinducing the noble ornament
of humility. Your country has * with one voice,
attested your excellence by inviting you again to
public life, and you have confirmed its judgment
by returning to frefli scenes and toils after you
had retired totliefhade from the burden and beat
of a long day.
Among the many signal interpositions of Divine
Providence, we remark the late important change
in the general government; a change neither ef
fected by accident, nor imposed by force ; but
adopted in the bosom of peace, after a free and
mature deliberation ; and in which a people wid&-
ly extended, and various in their habits, are
united beyond the most raised expectations. In
these refpecls the United States of America stand
single among all the nations of the earth. Other
revolutions may have been more diverfifiecl and
splendid, but none more honorable to human
nature, and none so likely to produce such hap
py effects. This government being now com
pletely organized, and all its departments filled,
we truss that God will give wisdom to its councils,
and justice to its adminillration ; and that we ffiali
at length realize tliofe blelfings which animated
our hopes through a difficult and ruinous war.
To our constant prayers forthe welfare of our
country, and of the whole human race, we fliali
esteem it our duty and happiness, to unite our car
neft endeavors to promote the pure and undefiled
Religion of Christ; foras this secures eternal feli
city tomenin a futureftate, so we are perfr.aded
that good Christians will always be good
and that where righteousness prevails among in
dividuals, the nation will be great and happy.
Thus while just government protects all in their
religious rights, true religion affords to govern
ment its surest support.
We implore the Lord God to be your fun and
shield. May your administration be prosperous.
May the bleflings of millions come upon you, and
your name be grateful to all posterity. Above
all, may you finifh your course with joy, be num
bered amouethe redeemed of the Lord, and enter
into everlafling reft.

Gentlbmen,
T RECEIVE with a grateful heart your pious and
J- affectionate address ; and with truth declare to
you that iÂ»o circumstance of my life has affected me
more sensibly, ofr produced more pleasing emotions
than the friendly congratulations and strong afliir*pn.-cs of support wliicli I liave received from my
fellow-citizens of all descriptions, uponmy elec
tion to the Prelidency of these United States.
1 fear, Gentlemen, yoiji goodness liasled you to
form too exalted an opinion of my virtues and me
rits.âlf such talents as I pollefs have been called
into action by great events, and i liofe events have
terminated happily for our country, the glory
jhould be r.fcribed to the manifeft interpolition of
an over-ruling Providence. My military services
have been abundantly recompenced by the flatter
ing approbation of a grateful people; and if a
faithful discharge of my civil duties can ensure a
like reward, 1 shall feel inyl'elf richly compensated
for any personal facrifice 1 may have made, by
engaging again in public life.
i The citizens of the United States of America
liave given as lignal a proof of their wisdom and
virtue in framing and adopting a constitution of
government without bloodlhed or the intervention
Â«Â»f force, as they, upon a former occasion, exhib
ited to the world oftheir valor, fortitude and per
severance ; - -and it mult be a pleating circnmftance
to every friend of good order and Ibcial liappi
jief's, to find that our new government is gaining
strength and relpectability among the citizens of
this country in proportion as its operations are
known and its effects felt.
You, Gentlemen act the part of pious Christians,
and good citizens, by your prayers and exertions
to preserve that harmony and good will among
men, which mult be the basis of every political
eltablifhmentand I readily join with you, that
" while just Government protects all in their re
" ligious rights, true religion affords to govern
" incnt its lurelt support."

ALLOW me, Gentlemen, to allure you, that
grateful as my heart is for the affectionate

AN ADDRESS to THE PUBLIC,
Frm:i the Pennsylvania Society jor promoting the /4-
bo lit ion of Slavery, and the Relief of free Negroes,
unlawfully held in bondage.
IT is with peculiar iarisfatftion we a flare the
friends of humanity, that in profeeming the
Jefign of o ir aflbciation, our endeavours have
proved fuccefsful, far beyond our moil sanguine
expectations.
Encouraged by this success, and by the daily
progress of that luminous and benign spirit of li
berty* which is diffuiing itfelf throughout the
world ; and humbly hoping for tlie continuance of
the divine blelling on our labours, we have ven
tured to make an important addition to our origi
nal plan, and do therefore, earneflly solicit the
support and assistance, of all who can feel the ten
der emotions of sympathy and compaifion, orre
lilh the ex.ilted pleasure of beneficence.
Slavery is fucli an attrocious debasement of hu
man nature, that its very extirpation, if not per
formed with solicitous care, may sometimes open
a fonrce of serious evils.
The unhappy man who has long been treated
as a brute animal, too frequently links beneath the
common Itandard of the human species. Thegal
ling chains that bind his body, do also fetter his
intellectual faculties, and impair the social affec
tions of the heart. Accuftoined to move like a
mere machine, by the will of a mailer, reflection
is suspended ; he has not the power of choice;
and reason and corifcience have but but little in
fluence over his condutfl ; because lieischiefly go
verned by the palfion of fear. He is poor and
friendlefsâperhaps worn out by extreme labor,
age and disease.
Under l'uch circumstances, freedom may often
prove a misfortune to himl'elf, and prejudicial to
society.
Attention to emancipated black people, it is
therefore to be hoped, will become a branch of
our national police ; but as far as we contribute
to promote this emancipation, so far that attention
is evidently a serious duty, incumbent on us, and
which we mean to to difcliarge to the belt of our
judgment and abilities.
To inltrudi; to advise ; to qualify those who
have been reltorcd to freedom, for the exercise
and enjoyment of civil liberty. To promote in
them habits of indullry ; to furnifli them with em
ployments suited to their age, sex, talents, and o
ther circumltances ; and to procure their chil
dren an education calculated for their future situ
ation in life. Tliefe are thegreat outlinesof the
annexed plan, which we have adopted, and which
we conceive will eflentially promote the public
good, and the happiness of these our hitherto too
much neglected fellow creatures.
A plan so extensive cannot be carried into exe
cution, without considerable pecuniary resources,
beyond the present ordinary funds of the society.
We hope much from the generosity of enlightened
and benevolent freemen, and will gratefully re
ceive any donations or fublcriptions for this pur
pose, which may be made to our treasurer, James
Starr, or to "James Pembertoit, chairman of our
committee of correspondence.
Signed by order oftlie Society.

NEW-YORK, Nov. 2,5.
Sunday eveninglaft an i ved the ship Montgome
ry, Capt. Bunyav, from London, after a very
short paflage; in which came paflengers, Col.
Trumbull, William Hill house, Esq. Mr.
Deas, of S.Carolina, and Mr. Hyde and lady.
By the Montgomery, we have accounts of the tranf
aCiions in trance, of a later date than -what has come
to hand by any former conveyance, These accounts
are contradittory to each ether ; but, in general the
f ollowing fafls may be relied on :
ON the arrival of the regiment de Flandtrs at
Ver failles, an entertainment as usual was giv
en by the officers of the Guade de corps &c. to the
officers of the regiment de Flanders. After this fef
tivity had continued some time, on the appearance
of the King and Queen from the gallery, there was
a cry of Vive le P oy et Vive le Reine : 011 which the
officers, and those of the Swiss guards (who were
likewise present, as if by a pre-concertcd plan)
pulled the national cockades from their hats,
treading them under their feet; and having black
cockades at hand, they were immediately distri
buted, and supplied the place of the red and blue.
An account of this soon reached Paris, and occa
sioned a general discontent. The people Aflem
bled for two or three days, without any decisive
measures, till the fourth day after the tranfaftion
at Versailles, when a large body without any head,
fat out from Paris for that place, and soon after
the Marquis de la Fayette marched at the head of
about twenty tlioufand of the Paris militia. On
their arrival at Versailles, they found three regi
ments drawn up to receive them ; but 011 beinÂ«
ordered to fire, the regiment de Flanders clubbed
their firelocks, and went over to the Marquis the
Swiss regiment refufed to fire, and stood motionless
â-and the guarde de corps were soon dispersed,
flying for lhelter to whatever covert they could
find. The Marquis immediately waited on the
King and Queen, informing them that to fatisfv
the people, and to avoid vvorfe consequences, they
mult remove to Paris. They were accordingly on
their way ; but so great was the croud, that they
were eight hours in going from Versailles t 0 Paris.
The trail Aid lor.s at Ve: I'iiiles apnea, c j t0 " -
been intended as a prelude to fon.t- more saC
efforts on the part of royalty ; as n was iuppofoi
and we apprehend juflly fuppol'ed, that the- e J'
liients then under ihc eye of the King, wuuldÂ»â"
have ventured on Inch a measure, to insult the
liatioiKii cockade, without the afliirancc of fom
powerful fnpport, and even without the confeuto'
their fuperiui s. The equivocation of the Kin? - 0
the application of the National A(teiiibly, rermelt
ing his allent to their articles or plan of a coniti'
tution, firlt gave rife to l'uch a fnrinilc, which fab
sequent tads have corroborated.
the National Aflembly have refolvedtore
move likewise to Paris : where it is hoped their
deliberations will be conducted with more unani
niity and dispatch ; for we are sorry to fay t W
there appears in many of the members of that bo
dy a disposition to delay, protrad and embarrafi
every ineafure at a time when the public exi<r ence
requires a contrary con dud; from every friend
to his country. The clergy in particular come un
der the imputation of duplicity ; and it is tho't
there must be a few more examples of severity
before the abettors of despotism will be induced
to relinquish the share of public plunder which
has fallen to them.âThere is a report that there
has since been a proscription of anumberof these
prevaricating gentry ; but the truth of this is
not fufficiently ascertained.
It is thought that the removal of the King to
Paris may be attended with beneficial effects ; as
it may remove from him evil councilors, and (hew
the folly of opposing the general wish, and that
spirit which aliens the long neglected rights of
human nature, against the encroaclunentsofpre
rogative.

Paris a prohibition against mobs, and have au
thorised the military to disperse them.
LONDON, Oct. J7.
In the affray at Versailles, the King's body
guards behaved very gallantly. About Joof the
Parisian troops and mob were killed, and thirty
of the King's guards were cut to pieces. Eighty
were carried prisoners to Paris, the reft fa vei
themselves by flight.
This regiment is different from any other, be
ing composed, both privates as well as officers, or
persons of the second order of the nobility 11
France. The heads of those who were (lainwere
carried in triumph to Paris, andfliown about t ie
streets 011 tent poles.
On Wednesday last all the diftrids ofParis
met early in the morning, and orders were giy en
to surround all the avenues of the Thuilleries,
which had been only defended the preceding
night by a common guard. A thoiifand
were immediately ordered on that duty, an
the gates of the palace are further fecurea y

Wednesday being Court day, their
received the. foreign Ministers in the pa' 3C "
King looked uncommonly dejeded, the (.J>was in tears tlie wliole time, aiut only talked a
little to the Imperial Ambaflador. The <Vht
was uncommonly gloomy, and the court broice up
after a short time.
In the evening the dittrkls of Paris, pafled a
refolucion, that the regimen, of the King's body
guard should be immediately broken, and never
more revivedâand that in future, his Majesty
should be guarded by citizens instead of soldiers.
During these proceedings at Paris, the Nation
al Aflembly at Verfaiiles did not transact much
business. On Wednesday evening, however, they
came to two resolutions, and it was fuppoied that
â would be the laltday of their fitting there.
The purport of these resolutions were, âThat
the National Aflembly should adjourn to Paris,
and, That its meeting should ever be inseparable
from the King's place of residence.
One bad consequence produced by the differ
ent revolutions that have taken place of late is,
that a general mistrust pervades the whole capi
tal.
For the lad 24 hours theKinghas not eaten an
ounce of food, and great apprehensions are enter
tained that his health is in great danger, to fay
110 more.
The ftlloTiiing is the Letter which caused thefirfl alarm
in the National dumbly.
" Gent I.imen,
11 LAWS newly constituted can only be properly fudged of,
â when taken :n their general mass ; âin such great and important
obje&s, the whole is joined by one common link.
" Nevertheless, I feel it extremely natural, that in a moment
â¢when we invite the Nation to come to the succour of the State,
' bvafignal aÂ£l of confidence and patriotism, we should afTuie it
of its neceflity and propriety. Therefore, in the hope that the
firfl articles of the Constitution which you have presented to me,
united with the continuation of your labors, will fulfill the ex
pectation of my people, and secure the happiness and prosperity
of my kingdom, I acquiesce in these Articles according to your
desire, but on this pofitivc condition, from which I never will de
part, That the general result of your deliberations fliall leave the
entire effeil of the Executive Power in the hands of the Monarch.
" A general view of my observations shall be lard before
' vou ; by which you will be nwde acquainted, that, in the present
order of things, lean neither with efficacy p rote Â£1 the recovery
of legal impositions, the frcecirculation of money and provisions,
nor the individual fafety of my citizens. I will nevertheless ful
fil the eflential duties of Royalty; the welfareÂ»of my fubjecis,
the public tranquility, and the preservation of good order among
foeiety, are dependant on it. It is my wish thefet'ore, that we
make it a common cause to remove those oblUcles which may ob
ftruft so deferable and lalutary an end*
" It remains for me to acquaint you with franknefs, that if I
give my acquiescence to the various articles of the Constitution
which you have laid before me, it is not that they arc according
to my ideas, a model of pcrfe&ion ; but that I consider it praile
â worthy in me not to delay paying attention to the present wifn
es of the deputies of the nation, and the alarming circumliances
which so strongly invite us to reflore the public tranquility and
confidence among the people.
t( I do now explain myfelf on your declaration of the rights
of man and citizci s. It contains very excellent maxims pio
pc r to guide your deliberations ; but principles which are liable
to different applications, and even conllruÂ£tions cannot be justly
appreciated ; nor is it necellarv they thould be, until the no
ment when their true sense is fixed by those laws to which they
arc to serve as a basis. (Signed) L O U 1 S."

REMARKS ON TAXATION.
THE greatelt effects are produced by the most
liinple causes. A great mind may be diftin
guifbed by the simplicity of its conceptions, and
the art of managing momentous concerns, by thole
plain means which others have overlooked. If we
examine the hiltory of mankind we shall perceive
that the moll: eminent characters in civil and reli
gious policy, obtained their superiority of reputa
tion by discerning the opportune moment to I weep
away complicated fyftems,the work of thole who
had been laboi ioully and minutely wife ; andfub
ftituting in their place some plain scheme of truth
and practice, which the people can understand and
fee to be fortheir advantage. In every enlighten
ed country, aniajority of the people are willing to
do right, or what is the fame thing, that which is
for their own interest. Intricacy in the measures
of government, is a common courle of losing the
public confidence ; and this ought to be the cafe,
as it exposes the fubjecft to tyranny and fraud, with
out any means of detection. The manner of rai
ling, collecting and applying a national revenue,
has generally been esteemed ttie most difficult part
of government,and doubtless more uneasiness hath
arisen from this than every other source. This dif
ficulty hath generally been imputed to the avarice
of the human heart. It hath been laid that the
people will neceflarily be displeased, with every
regulation which requires any contribution of
their property to the public ; but I cannot yet be
lieve that so much both of the fool and knave is
eflential to human nature. Honesty is known to
be the best policy, and the ruling half of an in
formed people, letting aflde moral obligation, will
on this account prefer honesty. Let them be
convinced the State is honest in its government,
apd with the fame honesty and cheerfulnefs, they
will contribute their quota of tlve general ex
pence ; but the people can never have this evi
dence of national integrity with luch acontulion
of schemes as have filled the United States.
More than four fifths of the citizens through
the Union are willing to fatisly every demand
of The late revolution of government
is a proof that they have magnanimity faffici
ent for every event, But in this business a finan
cier who means to lead them, must have a simple
and plain system both of railing and applying.the
revenue. He must have a permanent systemâone
that will not need new modelling every session of
the supreme Legi.-hture. It is allowed on all
hands that taxation hath caused uneasiness in most
of the States, buc it is not from any want ofhonef
ty in the people. Some reasons of this uneasiness
were mentioned iii my last number, and there are
others which deserve notice. When the-funis to
be paid in the progress of the war became consider
able, the State Legislatures through almost the
whole union, with the best intentions and a real
design to favor the people, set theinfelves to new
modelling those modes of taxation, to which they
had been refpeitively usedâaddition upon addi
tion was made to the tax lawsâevery year pro
duced something new,which, the next, was proba
bly repealed, for the fake ot'fome alteration sup
posed to be better. This fluctuating state of the tax
laws became a temptation for particular persons
to favor themselves ; and jealousy has been gra
dually introduced between respectable clalfes of
citizens, whose property is in difficult situations.
The people at large are unable to comprehend the
design of such frequent alterationsâthe whole ap
pears to them like confufion, and a game played
between the more knowing ones, to promote their
own purposes. A frequent violation of funds or
appropriations to particular uses, in the applicati
on of revenue hath been another ground of unea
siness. The State must be saved at all events, and
there may be exigencies of danger which will war
rant such violations ; but nothing of this kind can
amount to a jollification, in one quarter ofthein
ftances which have happened. A worthy citizen
always wishes for an opportunity to glory in the
good faith of his countryânational justice is his
prideâthe want of it wounds his feelings and finks
his ambitionâhe becomes! weary of paying, when
t he whole system is a chaos, and the application so
variable that none are fatisfied, and the public do
not obtain the reputation even of trj ing to bejnft.
Another source of uneasiness, and this 1 think with
great reason, is, that part of the public creditors
have been wholly negleifted, and among those who
have received some compensation it hath been on
various principles and in different proportions,
though all had a right to the fame justice. One
half of the citizens without receiving any interest
on their own securities, have been taxed to pay the
intereftdue to their neighbors,whofe notes might
run in another name, but had no preference in e
quity. They submitted to the neceility of the times
with a fortitude almost unparalleled, and it must
Aot be any longer expected from them. There is
but one remedy for this evilâlet United States
afl'ume the whole public debtâit was incurred for
them and in equity they ought to fee it funded.
The principal ought not to be paid if there was
public ability, but the interest fhouldbe annual
ly fatisfied.
This debt will he an advantage to the nation,
and to individuals, to government, commerce, a
griculture and manufactures. I can forefee it will
be enquired how shall this be done, will not so vast
an amount fink the people ? By many tliefe en
quiries are honestly made, and by some merely to
terrify. Methodize and Amplify your whole trea
sury department, and the burden on the peofle
will not be onÂ«* half of what they have annually
borne for fifteen years. The United States have
now an import, the savings of this, beyond the
support of civil government will amount to a
large sumâbut other ways and means will doubt
lels be requiiite. In a number of the States there
is now an excise, which ought to be baniilied from
all, or extended through the wholeâand perhaps
the latter will be found wecefiary. An excise is
a tax attended with some difficulty in collettion,
and if not thoroughly gathered proves a dis
couragement to the lionelt, who wish to observe
all the regulations of government : but notwitli
standing this difficulty, there are some reasons
both of policy and equity, which I shall mention
in some future number, that may render this
mode of revenue expedient. The tax paid by the
country planters and farmers, ought to be of one
kind, and on the most simple principles, such that
every man may know by his own calculation,
what will be demanded from him. Among the
various expedients of taxation, devised by human
ingenuity, a land tax of a certain sum pr. acre on
improved lands, is the most limple and perma
nent. It admits no altercation concerning the
sum to be paidâbeing placed on stable and im
moveable property, the difhonett cannot by any
fraud escape payment âit favors the poor who
liSve little pi operty, while a poll tax crushes them
âIt conies 011 such as have solid wealthâThe
quantity of improved land bears a nearer propor
tion to the comparative wealth of individuals in
the State, than any other articles which can be re
duced to taxation. Another thing which favors
this mode of taxation in the United States is, that
it may be carried into effect with ease, and in an
intelligible manner, through every part of the
empire. There will be no need of intermedling
with the different policies of revenue inthefever
al States,which cannot be reduced into a harino-
iiious system. Avery finali land tax i*i addnioii
to the orlier branches ol*revenue, would be fuftt'
cient, and could in be introduced, by the plain
liefs and limplicity of its operation, would givd
general content.

LETTER XIIIT
Amsterdam, Oct. 26, 17S0.
S 1 Ry
THE thirteenth enquiry is, " Of what resour
ces might America hereafter ft ill make use of?"
There are many resources, yet untried, which
Would certainly be explored, if America fliould
be driven to the neceflity of them.
1. Luxury prevails in that young country, not
withstanding all the confident aflertions of the
Englilh, concerning their diltrefs, to a degree,
that retrenching this alone would enable them to
carry 011 the war. There are expences in wheel
carriages, horses, equipage, furniture, dress, and
the table, which might be spared, and would a
mount to enough to carry 011 the war.
2. The Americans might, and, rather than the
English ihould prevail against them, they would
be brought to impose duties upon articles of lux
ury and convenience, and even of neceflity, as
has been done by all the natious in Europe, i am
not able at present, and upon memory, to enter
tain you with accurate calculations: but in gen.
eral it may be said, with certainty, that if as
heavy duties were laid upon articles of consump
tion and importation as are laid in England, or
even in Holland, it would produce a revenue fuf
ficient to carry 011 this war, without borrowing
at all. I hope, however, they will never come to
this: lam clear they need not. Such fyflemat
ical and established revenues are dangerous to li
berty ; which is fafe, while the revenue depends
upon annual grants ot the people, because this se
cures public economy.
3. If there fliould be hereafter any accelfion
to the population of America, by migrations from
Europe, this will be a frefli resource; because,
in that country of agriculture, the ability toraife
a revenue will bear aconftant proportion to the
numbers of people,
4. There are immense traifts of uncultivated
lands. Tliefe lands are all claimed by particular
States : But if these States fliould cede these claims
to the Congress, which they would do in cafe of
neceflity, the Congress might fell these lands,
and they would become a great resource : No man
can fay how great, or how lasting.
5. There is a great deal of plate in America ;
and if flie were driven to extremities, the ladies,
I afliire you, have patriotism enough to give up
their plate to the public, rather than lose their li
berties, or run any great hazard of it.
6 There is another resource flill. The war
may be carried 011 by means of a fluctuating me
dium of paper money. The war has been carried
on in tlijs manner hitherto : and I firmly believe,
if the people could not find a better way, they
would agree to call in all the paper, and let it lie
as a demand upon the public, to be hereafter e
tjuitably paid, according to its fluctuating value,
in silver, and emit new bills, to depreciate, and
carry on the war in the fame way. This, however,
Wjeyld occasion many perplexities, and much un-
Xappinefs ; It would do injnftice to many indivi
duals, and;will,and ought to be avoided,if possible.
7. A loan from Europe, however, wonld be
the best resource, as it would neceflarily extend
our trade, and relieve the people from too great
a present burden. Very heavy taxes are hurtful,
because they leflen the increase of population, by
making the means of fubfiltence more difficult.
S. There are resources of agriculture, manu
factures, and labor, that would produce much if
explored and attempted.
9. The resources of trade and privateering
ought to be mentioned again. The real caufeof
our doing so little hitherto is this.-
in 1 774, agreed upon anon-exportation, to begin
in 1775. This induced the merchants, in every
part of America, to fend their ships and Tailors to
England from whence the molt of them neverre
txirned. The consequence of which was, that the
Americans have been dillrefled for want of ships
andfeamen ever since. But the number of both
has increased every year, in spite of all that the
English have taken and destroyed. The vast num
ber of ships and seamen taken this year, will re
pair thole 10111-s ; and no man can fay to what ex
tent trade and piivateering will be carried the
<iext and succeeding years.
I have the honor to be, &c.
