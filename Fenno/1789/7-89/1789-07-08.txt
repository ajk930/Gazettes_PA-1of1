the TABLE T. No. XXV.
i< ft is the humour of many people to be Jmgular in
their dress and manner of life, onlyr to the end that
they may be takenâ  more notice of."
THE desire of being distinguished is so strong,
that Tonic men had rather be ridiculed, than
not to be noticed at all. Those who set them
selves upas a gazing stock to the rabble, and ex
cite a species of" admiration by affecting some fri
volous distinction from other people, are under
the influence of the ineaneft kind of ambition.
Nothing can sooner destroy the real refped.abili
ty ot a man, than an affectation of Angularity in
opinions or customs, which are in themselves in
different. But Ido not know a more ridiculous
fliape that ambition and vanity can allumc, than
when it prompts people to depart from common
faihion in their dress and style of living. 1 here
are obvious advantages from having some uni
formity established in the customs, which relate
to our commontranfacftions in lite. Those there
fore who depart from them, may in some measure
be considered as disturbers of the tranquility of
other people. . . .
Some persons are too apt to refine in their ideas
of following the dictates of found judgment.
They will fay that no wife man will trouble him
i'elf to pursue any cuftoin, however public it may
be, unless some reason can specially be offered in
its'favour. This rule fliould be reversed, and in
all indifferent matters, one fliould follow the
fafhion,unlefs some special reason can be alledged
against it.
To differ from the reft of mankind in any im
material thing may indicate more pride or ill hu
mour than others poflefs, but it is 110 mark of su
perior understanding. There must be a degree
of indiscretion in every instance of Angularity,
that does not originate in duty or convenience.
I evenqueftion whether a man is not under obli
gations to fall in with, or at any rate, not to op
pose the established customs of society, unless he
believes them uureafonable or inconvenient.
This probably will never be the cafe, for I doubt
whether the prevailing taste and feelings of the
community may be looked upon as altogether ar
bitrary and capricious. When'any custom predo
minates, for a confiderablc length of time, it is
a tolerable evidence, that there is some founda
tion in reason for its exiftenctf,. though perhaps
the real advantages of it may not be perceived or
acknowledged.

\IR. FENXO,
I Shall fend you orcafionallv extracts from a performance that I
havern my hands, which I conceive will correspond with the ge

"OWE SO MAN ANY TIIIXG."
THE motto is an injnnftion from fcripture,and like many other
phages otthatfaered depofitot moral and divine indru&iou,con
tains oneof the molt ufelul lessons of human life.
I Ihall mention the nicft likely means ot paying what we owe.
The firft mean is diligence in bufmefs : Mod men depend on
ni'finef* for an honed livelihoodâsuccess in which depends on
"rly attention, skill and diligenceâa due distribution oi time and
labor, and a punctual adherence to our calling, are means of dili
Â£cnce : Yield not to languor, the importunity of companions, or
a taflc for plcafure however innocent, so far as to break an en
gagement, or neglect the duties of your profeflion.
There are a few profefiions where the reward is not in exact
proportion to diligence. Servantsof the public, and the clergy,
avc uluallv a fixed salary. If a sense of duty does not influence

To finifh one thing, before beginning another, to put everything
m its place, to keep dilcharges, and vouchers, are apparently small
matters; and yet by being duly attenoed to, much time is saved,
the reputation ot honesty is maintained, which often fuffers by de

FROM THE MASSACHUSETTS CENTJNEL.
B. Russell,
SOME eminent modern patriots have pointed out the imminent
DANGER ot 11TLES ; but I think tiiey don't go far enough;
and therefore to complete their good design, I propose to make
one sweep of the whole feed, arms, legs, and toes of aristo
crats and tyranny, by knocking away *<i the rubbish and ftaff o1
TiTLisat one stroke, that nothing may emain to dim theeternai
reign of liberty. Henceforth, let US, (I mean the true uncon
taminated whigs) lisp nothing tht pure names of men. How
ever high in office, they are still Jervants to the people, (but wemufl
even take care how we talk or make ute of the word Jervunt in thu
fenfc, Iclt tyranny Ihould creep in at tins end of the horn) and
therefore plain John Anybody thould be our address.
It is not enough that we avoid the tit'es of Majejty, Excellency,
Honorable, Esquire, &c. but in short cfery thing.âMr. fignifies
Majler, leads to llavery;â away with it. No
verends, nor V. D. M's, nor A. M's, nor Mrs, or Mtfs, âfor wc
may be enslaved by petticoats as well as breeches.
Now I defy any Anftrocrat to (how me a country ever ensla
ved where there never were any titles f These are the feed of the
political white weed, which overspreads the fair fields of creation
âfor M/henJome wear titles, the people will think they are not all
'.qual, and it equality is loft, the scale of liberty kicks the beam.
Wherefore every man Ihould think himfdf equal (at least, perhaps
a little better! to any man in tiie nation. This 1 call the pure,
anadulterated spirit of freedom. In such a State, I'll warrant there
will be no Anjtocrats to cloud the political sky, but fun, moon
Â»nd flars will fhme clear, and forever. ARGOS.

1 he Marefchal de Noailles has, without any ap
plication whatever, iilued an ordinance, dated the
Sth of March, in which he renounces his exclu

when any nation wilhes to break this peace, theer
will be four months notice given of the fame
Mr. Pitt's great and good name extends itfelf

to acknowledge that he wants that no longer :
while his adversaries talk of his persecution and
hard heartednefs. Lenity to bad men is cruelty to
those who arc otherwise.

to about ;000, exclnfi\e of the officers who pre

May 2. On Wednesday last the gold medal
was voted by the society, for the encouragement
of arts toCapt. Peckingham of the navy, for his
valuable invention of Aeeringafhip, by an appa
ratus that can be fitted to the mast in afecond, in

May 4. At Paris, there as been an alarming
infurredtionâA capital manufacturer having un
intentionally offended the common labourers,
they aflembled in great numbers to pull down his
works, &c.âHe applied to the military for pro
tectionâthe military came, and were attacked
bv the mob, who killed several of the soldiersâ
The military were then reinforced, and a dread
ful slaughter ensued, in which more than 600
persons -were killed. The scene was the Fa
bourg de St. Antoine.
We learn by accounts from Nemours, that the
bailiage of that quarter have nominated their de
puties for the ensuing meeting of the States Ge
neral. The viscount Noailles has been elected
representative of the Noblefle, and the following
articles form a small part of his inAructions from
that order for his conduct at the national allembly.
" The wish of the noblefle of the bailiage, be
fore any other subject be entered upon, is, that
the individual liberty of Frenchmen should be
guaranteed, comprehending under this idea, a
right to go, return from, and remain in, any
part, within or-without the kingdom, they think
proper, without being subject to solicit perinifiion
for that purpose; submitting, nevertheless, to
the determination of the States-General such ca
ses where it may beneceflary to restrain a liberty
of leavingthe kingdom. That the liberty of the
press should be granted, under such reflrietions
as the States-General may judge proper.âThat
at the meeting of the states poAerior to the ap
proaching aflembly, the two flrft orders shall be
united in one and the fame chatriber, wilder thg
express condition that this chamber, formed of
the two firft orders, shall be coinpofed of one
member of the clergy to two of the noblefle ; and
that then every object proposed in the firft and
second chamber may be equally proposed, reject
ed or accepted, in the other, in such manner
that the free consent of the separate chamber shall
be neceifary to give the force of law to every sub
ject deliberated therein. In cafe of war, change
of reign, or regency, the States-General lhall be
convoked in fix weeks.âThe periodical return
ot the slates to be fixed at two years; reckonino
from the end of the foregoing'aflembly.âMini"
fters shall be accountable to the States-General
for the employment of the funds confided to
them, and responsible to the States-General in
all matters relative to the laws of the kingdom.
There shall be no denial of juflice in any cafe 01*
to any person.âNo loan, under whatever form
it maybe, circulating paper, office or commifiion,
of any nature whatsoever, shall be created or ef
tabliihed but by the will or consent of the nation
aflembled.âThe States-General shall attend to
the. vexations and abused government of the mi
litia, the effects of which are eflentially prejudi
cial to agriculture. The States-General should
as soon as possible determine on the fuppreflioii
of the capitaineries, as they form a jurifdicftion
foreign to the laws of the kingdom, are a mani
feft violation of the sacred right of property, and
which many persons who exercise those usurped
privileges use in a cruel and oppreflive manner.
The King's chafe and that of the Princes to be
reduced to the simple right of chafe within the
limits of the lands and seigniories of their do
mains. The abolition of the Franc Fief to be
demanded of the States-General. To exert
themselves to effect an annihilation of the destruc
tive impost of the Gabelle : and that there be in
the provinces but one weight and measure."
1 hat noble entliufiafm which always exists in
the authors and inventors of ufeful and agreea
ble arts, is easily excited by public applause, but
is too often forced to waste itfelf in obfeurity, and
in unavailing struggles to overcome vulgar pre
judices again A all new inventions. There per
haps never was an lera when the spirit of im
provements of all kinds was carried further than
at present ; nor when there was more ingenious
men in all branches of the arts. We apprehend
that an account of new improvements will be
acceptable sometimes, also intermixed with an
account of the inventors.
Sir Richard Arkwriglit was originally a barber,
at Preston, in Lancashire, and shaved for a penny.
Having been imprisoned for some doubtful con
duct at acontefted election, in the gaol he formed
the plan of his celebrated machine for preparing
and spinning cotton. It was a considerable time
before he could procure money to set up his ma
chine. An old cuAomer of his, who had a me
chanical turn, was persuaded to join with him.
He carried on his improvement with so much vigor, that even although he loft part of his patent,
his income from his mills before the great failure
lalt year, amounted, to a revenue of 40,0001. per
annum.
Watts and Bolton. Mr. Watts is a native of
Scotland. He was not bred to mechanics ; but
to the conftruc r tion of mills, and the application
of lteam to machinery, has made improvements,
of which the use to the arts are unlimited. And
what renders his merit the greater, is, that his
improvements are not the efteJt of accident, but
of long and persevering investigation, depending
wholly upon fcientific principles. He has ob
tained a patent, in which Mr. Bolton is included,
and in a few years will eftablilh a revenue of
10,000 per annum.
May 5. The report of the Emperor of Ger
many's death, was again very prevalent in town
yesterday, but no official accounts were received.
After the election of Caen, the Duke de Coigny
gave a grand entertainment to the Three Orders :
during the del'ert, the Duke calling to a fanner
of Falaife, who is one of the deputies of the
lower order, said, " Well Mr. Poullain, as you
are about to lit in our national alleinbly, have
you thought of the requisition you are to make ?"
" Certainly, my Lord," and what do you mean
to propose ? " First of all, I lhÂ»ll require the
suppression of pigeons, rabits and friars." Af
ter a hearty laugh, occasioned by this odd sally,
he was alked his reasons. " Why, said he, the
pigeons destroy our corn in the feed, the rabbits
in the blade, and the friars in the Jhock."
May 6. The French Court, by an order of
Council, dated the 20th ult. to be in force from
the Ift of May to the Ift of September, have dou
bled the bounties, granted by that of the 11 tli of
January, upon the importation of corn and meal
from the different parts of Europe, and extend
ed to importations by the frontiers. The pre
sent bountiej are, 50 sols per quintal on wheat,
40 sols on wheat flour, 34 sols on rye, 32 sols on rye
flour, 20 sols on barley, 2 7 sols on barley meal ;
and all vellels without diftindiion, which within
that time lhall import any corn of the species above
mentioned, fliall be exempted from freight duties.
MAY 7.
POLI PICAL DISQUISTIONS.
Europe is at this day divided into several parties,
\vhofe intereits are so complicated, it is fcarely
possible to establish an equilibrium betwixt them.
The American revolution has originated two
fatftions.
011 the one fide, France and Spainâon the
other fide England. ,
England has also drawn Holland and Prussia in
to her party.
As ftrangcrsto this contest, Germany and the
other northern states preferv ea neutrality.
But they likewile form two confederacies
The one conlifting of Pruflia and the other states
of Germany, who league for the purpole of
checking the Emperor's encroachments :âAnd
the other between the latter and the Empress,
whole stipulations bind them to such defenfive
operatione as the last confederacy may' occasion,
and both to offenfive measures against Turkey.
England and Spain are alirioft wholly uncon
cerned in these two leaguesâFrance alone can
consider herlelf interested in them ; but in cafe
fhefhould engage herfelf in these consequences,
what aid would Ihe derive from Turkey ?
Supposing, notwithstanding the consanguinity
of the Houses of Aultria and Bourbon, and the
complaints of France against Rulfia,France should
accede to the Germanic League, Turkey must
remain ufelels to the latter power, because Rulfia
would always keep a check over her, and could
also harrafs Sweden and Prulfia.
But is it to be supposed, that England wouldnot
seize an opportunity of avenging the injuries that
wei e rendered her in America ?
On Sunday fe'nniglit an unlucky accident hap
pened at the Caiile d'Efcompte, at Paris. A
courier with the King's livery arrived, and alked
foroneofthe Directors, M. Vincent, to whom a
letter was addreiled, signed Neckar, and l'ealed
with that Minister's arms. The purport of the
letter was, that the said M. Vincent, was desired
to deliver to the bearer 100,000 livres (5000 I.)
for the use of his Majesty. Upon enquiry the
signature was forged, that is to fay, Mr. Neckar's
Secretary's hand was imitated to a wonder. As
none would presume to wear the King's livery,
various are the conjectures about this extraordi
nary occurrence.

ing reception from The President and Vice-Pref

pearance was truly martial) to St. Paul's Church,
where in the presence of a most refpeiftable and
brilliant audience,an elegant Eulogium on Major-
General NATHANIEL GREENE, was delivered
by Col. Alexander Hamilton. The Society
011 this occalion were honoured l>y the presence
of the Lady andFainily of The President, his in
disposition (which thanks be to Heaven has nearly
left him) preventing his personal attendanceâthe
Vice-Preiident, and ladies of his familyâthe Se

After the Eulogium, the Society returned (at

OF THE MILITARY.
The city legion ofGen.MALCOM's brigade pa
raded at the fort in the morning, and marched
from thence, through Queen Street, into the fields,
in the following order:
Lieut. Col. Chrystie.
Cavalry, under the command of Capt. Stakes.
One piece of Artillery,
commanded by Capt. Ljeut. Stoutenburgh.
Major John Stagg.
Adjutant John Loudon.
The Battalion,
consisting of Captains Stoutenburgh's and
Scriba's Grenadiers.
Capt. Le Roy's, Capt. Sw/rtwout's,
Capt. Vredenburgh's, Lieut. Rutger's, Capt.
Livingston's, and Capt. Stepdiford's
companies of Light Infantry.
One piece of Artillery,
commanded by Lieut. Suydam.
After being reviewed by a number of gentle
men of diftindtion, they went through a variety
of manoeuvres and firings, with great pronipti
tude and exadtnefs, and made a brilliant and sol
dierly appearance. On their return from the
parade,they pafiedthe houfeof The Presidbnt,
who appeared at his door in a fuitof regimentals,
and was laluted by the troops as they pafled. His
indisposition deprived the troops of the honor
and fatisfadtion of being reviewed by him in the
field.
At noon afalute was fired from the fort by Col.
Bauman.
At four o'clock the officers fat down to an en
tertainment provided for them at Mr. Faunces'
in Cortland street, when toasts suited to the oc
casion were drank.
At the third toast viz: The President of
the United States, agreeably to invariable cuf
toni, the officers rose and saluted it with three
cheers ; and the band immediately gave General
Washington's inarch. Truly charadteriftic of the
principles on which the order of the Cincinnati
is founded ; and defignative of the sentiments
which adtuate tliofe who from republican mo
tives, in peace, prepare for war, there was a
mutual interchange of refpedlful attentions be
tween the gentlemen at Bardin's, and those at
Fraunces' tavern, congratulating each other 011
return of this Anniversary, so dear to every in
dependent American.
The business of Legiilation for this extensive
continent opens a boundless field of contempla
tion to the refledlingmind. When it isconfider
ed what a variety of objedisis presented to the at.
tention of our civil fathersâhow apparently dis
cordant the interests of the fevcral Statesâwhat
deep rooted prejudices exist in the minds of many
upon this fubjedt; producing consequences which
give as it were a real existence to this incompati
bility of interestsâthe extensive and complicate
nature of those systems which are neceflary in ar
ranging the financesâeftablilhing the great exe
cutlve departmentsâforming plans of revenue,
anil fixing the regulations inseparably connected
with thole plansâand all these to be so far adapt'
ed to the habits and dispositions of the people of
the leveral States as to secure a fuccefsful opera
tion to the new government; 1 fay, when these
things are properly considered, it will appear,
that abilities, labour, patience, and deep invelti
gation, are requilite on the part of administra
tion ; and candonr, good humour, and a reafou
ble acquiescence are equally required from the
people, to give efficacy to the laws, aiid success
to the work of their own hands.
At this important and highly interesting per
iod of the American history, the publican hid
lliould be conltantly attentive to the great objec r ts
that present themlelves on every handâthe fu
ture operation of that system of government which
the people have adopted, will receive a tincture
from the reception which it firft meets with from
the collective body of the citizens : Every polfi
ble method is taken to convey to all parts of the
Union, the earliest and molt authentic informa
tion ofgovermental proceedingsâthe springs, the
motives on Which public decisions are founded are
fully disclosedâso that it evidently appears, that
the real interests of the people are the principal
obje<t of pursuit to those whom the people have
deputed to fuperintCnd their concernsâand it
rationally follows, that a full acquiescence in their
determinations will give a tone, a complexion to
the government of the Union, which shall ensure
the dignity, prosperity, and 'liappinefs of this'
great people.
Government is perhaps as difficult a subject as
any upon which the faculties of the human mind
can be employed.âFor although it is evidently
defignedto be the medium of almost every blefl
ing, that gives worth to existence, yet too many
are difpofedto confiderit as the result of human
we3knefs, and an unhappy necellity.âThis sen
timent has found so many fuccefsful advocates,that
there is reason to fuppofe,the contrary opinion will
require the long continued labors of the patriotto
obtain an universal afcendencyâbutthis difficulty
is not the most formidable that the friends of go
vernment have to encounter :âThe infinite va
riety of ideas, as to the best methods to obtain
the best ends, which prevail in the minds of
those who subscribe to the sentiment, that go
vernment is the effect of the wisdom and good
ness of divine providence, occasion great delays,
and those inefficient systems, which too general
ly defeat the public expectation.
The Impost Bill having received the signature
of The President, will soon be a Law of the
United States in operation.âThe importance of
this aÂ«thas occafioneda lengthy investigation of
its principles, and every clause has received the
fulleft difculfion ; it is therefore to be hoped, that
it will meet with universal approbation.âThe
scale of the duties is formed upon that happy me
dium, which is commonly the refult'of mutual
concession, and which in matters of revenue,
experience has always proved to be just, politic
and most produitive.
The pithiness of the following remark will
recommend it to all true federaliits. " Heaven
forbid any conventions for a while ! I dread the
work of fifteen hundred reformers in the present
fludluation of sentiments. If we must at all a
mend, I pray for merely amusing amendments ;
a little frothy garnish. But why do we not ra
ther fit down as brothers, and feaft on the sub
stantial meat, for which we have fafted so long !' y

WEALTH EXAMINED.
[Cintinutd from No. XXIII.]
In the year 302 the ambafladors -were returned,
and Appius Claudius, whole anceftorshad always
been haughty ariltocratics, was chosen consul,
withT. Gentius for his colleague. The lenate
alfembled, andrefolved that decemviri lhould be
eledced out of the principal senators, whole au
thority should continue a year ; that they lnould
govern the commonwealth with all the power
which the consuls then had, and as the kings had
formerly exerciled, and without any appeal from
their judgments ; that all other magiltracies,and
even the tribune/hip, lhould be abolilhed. This
decree was received by the people with loud ac
clamations. An aliembly, by ccnturies, was im
mediately held, and the new magifttates created,
and the old ones all abdicated their offices. Thus
the constitution was wholly changed, and all au
thority transferred to one centre, the decemvirs.
It was soon exerciled like all other authorities in
one centre. We fee here the effects of two
powers without a third. The people from ha
tred to the consuls, and the senate from hatred
to the tribunes, unite at once in a total abolition
of the constitution.
The constitution of the decemvirs was precise
ly Nedhain's idea ; it was annually eligible ; it
was the people's government in their (uccelfive
aflemblies : But we find that an annual power,
without any limits, was a great temptation. The
decemvirs were all senators of consular dignity,
and therefore, in the opinion of the people tliem
felves, the molt eminent, lor talents and virtues ;
yet their virtues were not fufficient to secure an
honest use of their unbounded power. They
took many precautions to preserve their own
moderation, as well as to avoid excitingjealoul'y
in their fellow citizens : only one liad the rods
and axes, the others had nothing to diftinguilh
them but a lingle officer, called Accenfus, who
walked before each of them. Their president
continued only one day ; and they succeeded
each other daily, till the end of the year.âlt is
much to our purpose to enlarge upon this exam
ple ; becaule, instead of being an argument for
Nedhain's inconcinnate fyltem, it is full proof
againll it. The course of paliions and events,
in this cafe, were precisely the fame as will take
place in every simple government of the people,
by a fucceliion of their representatives, in a
lingle alfembly : And, whether that aliembly
contifts of ten members, or five hundred, it will
make no difference. In the morning,the decem
viri all went to their tribunal, where they took
cognizance of all causes and affairs, public and
private ; justice was adminiltered with all polli
ble equity ; and every body departed with per
fect l'atisfa&ion. Nothing could be l'o charming
as the regard they profelled for the interelts of
the people, and the protection which the meanelt
found against the oppression of the great. It was
now generally affirmed, that there was no occa
lion for tribunes, consuls, prsetors, or any other
magiltrates. The wisdom, equity, moderation,
and humanity of the new government, was ad
mired and extolled. What peace, what tran
quility, what happiness were enjoyed by the
public, and by individuals ! what a consolation !
what glory to the decemvirs ! Appius Claudius,
Â«specially, engrofled the whole glory of the ad
ministration in the minds of the people. He ac
quired lo decided an ascendency over his col
leagues, and so irresistible an influence with the
people, that the whole authority feemedcentred
in him. He had the art to diltinguifh himfelf,
peculiarly, in whatever he trail fact ed, in con
cert with his colleagues. His mildness and affa
bility, his kind condescension to the meaueftand
weakest of the citizens, and his polite attention
in saluting them all by their names, gained him
all hearts. Let it be remembered, he had, till
this year, been the open enemy of the plebeians.
As his temper was naturally violent and cruel,
his hatred to the people had arisen to ferocity.
011 a sudden he was become another man ; hu
mane, popular, obliging, wholly devoted to
please the multitude, and acquire their affedions.
Every body delighted in the government of the
decemvirs, and a perfect union prevailed among
themselves. They coinpleated the body of laws
and caufcd it to be engraved 011 ten tables :
They were ratified by the senate, confirmed by
the people in the coinitia centuriata, engraven
011 pillars of brass and placed in the forum. The
year was upon the point of expiring ; and as the
consuls and senators found themselves delivered
by the new government from the persecutions of
the tribunes, and the people from what they e
â qually hated, the authority of the consuls, both
parties agreed in the propriety of choofmg ten
iuccellors. It was pretended, that some further
laws might be still wanting ; that a year was too
ihort to complete so great a work ; and that to
carry the whole into full effetft, the independent
authority of the fame magifti acy would be neces
sary. That which rauft happen upon all annual
elections of such a government in one centre,
happened in this cafe. The city was hi a greater
and more universal ferment that liad ever been
known. Senators, the moll diftinguifued by v.ge
and merit, demanded the office ; no doubt to
prevent factious and turbulent i'pirits from ob
taining it. (To be continued.)
An ESSAY on FREE TRADE and FINANCES.
[Continued lroin No. XX.]
There may befome lew among us, of no little
weight, who are contcnt, it they can obtain the
services, to let the lervant lhift for himlelf, and
who, when they are lure of the benefit, remem
ber no longer the benefactor, and, as in this
great argument of universal concern, 1 wiih to
rind the way to every man's sense, and address
myfelf not only to those who have virtue, but
even to thole who have none, 1 will therefore
mention another advantage of this measure,
which I think will, virtue or no virtue, reach
the feelings of every man who retains the lealt
sense of interest, viz. that in this way all our pub
lic creditors would be paid and fatisfied, either by a
total diicharge of their principal, or an undoubt
ed well funded security of it, with a lure and
punctual payment of their interest, which would
be the belt of the two ; because a total discharge
of the principal at once, if fullicient money could
be obtained, would make such a sudden, so valt
an addition to our circulating cash, as would de
preciate it, and reduce the value of the debt paid
much below its worth at the time of contract, and
introduce a fluctuation of our markets, and other
fatal evils of a depreciated currency, which have
been known by experience and leverely felt,
enough to make them dreaded ; it would there
fore be much better for the creditor to receive a
certain well funded security of his debt than full
payment: for in that cafe, if he needed the calh
for his debt, he might fell his security at little
or no discount, which is the conltant prat'tice of
the public creditors in England, where every
kind of public security has its rate of exchange
fettled every day, and may benegociatedinave
ry fliort time. Supposing this lliouldbe the cafe,
ltop and fee what an amazing effect this would
have on every kind of bulinels in the country.
The public bankruptcies have been lo amazingly
great, numbers of our people have been
reduced bythemto the condition ofmenwho have
fold their ejjefls to broken merchants, who cannot pay
them, their bufmefs is lejfened, or perhaps reduced to
nothing for -want of their flock so detained from them.
Suppoling then that their flock was reltored to
them all, they would inltantly all push into busi
ness, and the proceeds of their butxnefcwould flow
through the country in every direction of induflry, and
every species of supply : in fine, the whole country
would be alive, and as it is obvious to every one,
that it is much better living in a country of brisk
business than one of ftagnatecl bufmefs, every in
dividual would reap benefits from this general
animation of indullry, beyond account more
than enough to compensate the tax which he has
paid to produce it. All these advantages hitherto
enumerated will put the labour and industry of
our people of all occupations on such a footing
of profit, and ffecurity, as would soon give anew
face to tlie country, and open such extenfiveprof
pecfts of plenty, peace and establishment, throw
into action so many sources of wealth, give such
liability to public credit, and make the burdens
of government so easy and almost imperceptable
to the people, as would make our country, not
only a molt advantageous place to live in, but
even make it abound with the richest enjoyments
and heart felt delights. These are objects ofgreat
magnitude and delirablenefs ; they animate and
dilate the heart of every American. What can
do the heart more good than to lee our country
a scene of justice, plenty and happiness ? are
these rich blellings within our reach ? can we be
lieve they are so absolutely within our power,
that they require no more than very practicable
efforts to bring us into the fullpoffelfion of them?
These blejfmgs are douktlefs attainable, if we will go
to the price of them, and that you may judge whe
ther they are worth the purchase, whether they
are too dear or not; I will give you the price cur
rent of them all, the price, which, if lionellly
paid, will certainly purchase them.
In order to have tliein, then, we mast pay
about a dollar and half a gallon for rum, brandy
and other distilled spirits ; a dollar a gallon above
the ordinary price lor wines ; a dollar and a half
for bohea tea, and about that sum above the or
dinal y price for hyson tea; a double price on
lilks of all forts, laces of all forts, and thin li
nens and cottons ol all forts, such as muffins,
lawns, cambrics, jewelery of all forts, &c. about
a dollar and third a yard above the ordinary price
for fupcrfine cloths of all forts, &c. &c. a third
of a dollar a bufiiel on fait, (for I don't mean to
lay quite all the tax on the rich, and wholly ex
cuie the poor,) about a dollar a hundred for su
gar, one tenth of a dollar a pound on coffee, the
lame on cocoa, above the ordinary price, &c. &c.
with an addition of five per cent on all articles of
importation nbr nrfmerated, except cotton, dye
woods, and other raw materials for our own
manufactures ; for wliilft importations are dilcou
raged, our own manufactures will naturally be
increased, and ought to be encouraged, or at
leaftbc diiburdened. OnthisftatCof tiier.i-'-Â»
I beg leave to observe, that the war itfelf for i" *
ven years part has laid a tax 011 us nearly equ-l -
the liighelt of these, and 011 i'oine articles of 1 1 Â°
cefliry consumption, from two hundred to"a
thousand per cent higher, such as fait, pep , )e "
alfpice, allum, powder, lead, See. & c . andvet
1 never heard any body complain of being ruined
by the war, because rum was twelve fhilWs â cr
gallon, tea twelve shillings per pound, or Van
tua's three dollars a yard, or pepper ten UrilW
a pound, or fuperfme cloths eight dollars ayarf
&c. Nor does it appear to me, "that the country
has paid a shilling more for rum, silks, s uper .
fine cloths, &c. for the lalt seven years, than
was paid for the fame articles the l'evenpre e
ding years, i. e. the whole tax was paid by l e f
fening the consumption of these articles. Nor
do 1 think that the health, habits, or happinefa
of the country have fuffered in the leaft'ou the
whole, from its being obliged to use less of these
articles than was before ui'ual; but be this as it
may, 'tis very certain that the country has fuf!
ferecl but little from the increased price of these
articles which 1 propose to tax, except at some
particular times when those prices were raised
much higher than the point to which I propose to
raise them, i.e. at particulartimesrum has been
as high as three dollars a gallon, tea three u. 1 -
lars a pound, sugars three lhillings and fix-pence
and coffee three shillings and fix-pence a pound
mantua's four dollars a yard, &c. but 'tis obser
vable, that the principal increased prices which
have really hurt and diflrefled the country du
ring the war, have been of other articles which
I propose to tax very lightly, or not at all; such
as fait, which has at times been fix dollars a bu(h
el, and perhaps thrtfe or four dollars on an ave.
rage, coarse cloths and coarse linens, ofnabrigs,
cutlery and crockery wares, &c. which have of
ten 1 ofe to five or fix prices, and flood for years
together at three or four, and yet the burden of
these exceflive prices of even necefiary articles of
unavoidable consumption has not been so great,
if you except the article of fait, as to befomuch
as mentioned very often among the ruinous ef
fects and diflreffes of the war. The use I mean
to make of these observations is, to prove from
plain acknowledged faift, that the increased price
of the articles which I wish to tax, up to the ut
molt point to which I propose to raise them, will
be but a light inconvenience, if any at all, on
the people, and the diminished consumption of
those articles, and the increase of circulatingcalh
which will naturally and unavoidably re
iult from the tax) will be benefits which will at
leatt compensate for the burden of the tax, and
1 think 'tis very plain, will leave a balance of ad
vantage in favor of the tax. But if you should
think I conclude too llrongly, and you should
not be able to go quite my lengths in this argu
ment, so much, I think, does at leafl appear in
contellably plain, that if there is a real disadvan
tage arising from my mode of taxing, 'tis so small,
that it holds no comparison with the burden of
tax hitherto in use 011 polls and eflates, which
discourages induflry, oppresses the labourer, les
sens the value of our lands, ruins our husbandry
and manufactures, and with all these dreary
evils, cannot poflibly be collected to half the
amount which the public services requires; but to
lave further argument on this head, I will with
great aflurance appeal to the sense, the feelings
of our farmers, who make the great bulk of our
inhabitants, if they would not prefer living in a
country where they mull pay the aforementioned
increased prices on the goods I propose to tax, ra
ther than where they must part with the fame
number of cows, oxen, sheep, bu/hels of wheat,
or pounds of pork or beef, &c. which are now in
the present mode of taxing, annually demanded
of them to fatisfy the tax. I dare make the fame
appeal to all our tradesmen, and even to our
merchants, â¢W'who, in my opinion, would have
clear and decided advantages from my mode oi
taxing as well as the farmers. I don't fee IIOW the
merchant can be hurt by the tax; but will clearly
be benefited by it. (To be continued.)
