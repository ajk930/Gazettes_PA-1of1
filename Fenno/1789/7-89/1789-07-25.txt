Â« Sagacity and good humour arc among the ejfen

SOME author in treating upon education,
introduces the following Itory.
Â« Plato in one of his dialogues tells us, that So
crates, who was the son of a mid-wife, nfed to fay,
fat as his mother, though Jhe was very /killed in her
trofc/Jion, could not deliver a woman, unless fhs was
fir I with child, so neither could he himfelf raise know
hideout (if a mind, where nature had not planted it.
Â» Accordingly the method this philosopher took, oj
jiiflriifting his fchclars, by several interrogatories or
auejlions was only helping the birth, and bringing their
In thoughts to light." , . .
The principle contained in this quotation
jhould not be carried too far. Indolent teachers
are too ap: to persuade tliemfelves, that every
scholar who actually does not make progress in
learning, is naturally incapable of it. 1 his be
lief induces them to neglect those youth who do
not manifeit tokens of genius, as unpromiHing
i'prouts. They huddle a number of them toge
ther and aflign them talks to delve upon ; and re
prove their dulnefs, rather than flrive to blow the
latent sparks of genius into allame. The talents
of some people lie so deep, and are of such a
contexture that it is difficult to bring them into
view. Many a lad palles through a collegiate e
duc3tion without any pleasure or reputation, who
after he is left to himfelf, and can exerci'e his
own judgment, in the application of his own a
bilities makes a refpedable figure in society, and
becomes more ufeful and eminent, than many
sprightly genuifes who despised and discouraged
him, when promifcuouily employed in the fame
course of study.
When the iuftructors at any University or
fcboolhave not a thorough knowledge of human
nature, the youth committed to tlieir care will
become averse to learning from the manner in
which inflrucftion is communicated. Such pro
feflors or tutors as do not gain the love and re
spect of their pupils cannot expeit their tuition
will be advantageous. It is of importance there
fore tliat the initructors should not only poilefs
learning and genius, but that they should bedif
tiaguiihed by an amiable, discreet deportment.
If under the direction of such men the academi
cians are discontented, idle or vicious, it fur
niJhes a prelumption that they are not employed
in that kind of literature which is suitable for
thein. We inuft either draw this conclulion, or
we have no other alternative than to fuppofe,that
they have such dulnefs of understanding, or such
perverfenefs of difpolition as can never be re
claimed. To diftinguilh which of these causes o
perates in producing such indolence and averlion
in any youth, we mull attend to his conduct and
temper in other respects. If a refractory and vi
cious inclination marks his general character, we
mult Dot ascribe his depravity to an improper
treatment in his fcliolaftic exercises. But if in
tlieufual tenor of his life, he manifefts a trada
ble and ingenious spirit, and can be restrained
from diflblute manners, we mult suppose his ha
tred of le arr.ing and his not making proficiency
m it, refult3 from an injudicious alignment of
his thirties. It can generally be known whe
therthe fault lies in the talk itfelf,orin the man
ner of imposing it, or in the natural lterility of
the fubjecft on which it is imposed.
fhebad habits and vices contracted at public se
minaries may seize such hold of the mind,that they
cm never be eradicated through life. In whatever
Itation aniana<ts, he will discover traits of his
education. It is to be regretted that a better
foundation is not laid to render the tranlitions
f:om youth to manhood, and Itudy to business
wore easy and natural. There seems to be a
chasm which it is difficult and often impraitica
le to fill up. Some blight scholars never become
ufeful men ; and many promising youth dwindle
asthcj grow old, into infignificance and contempt,
s this the inevitable decree of nature ? or is it
'he effect of erroneous education. My next pa
per shall touch upon the question.

graces ofobediencc, and filial refpeft, and allured him to the love
of virtue by exemplifying her charmsâwho have early formed
him to habits ot virtue, and taught him to be delighted with in
itruftion.âAfter parental care and tenderness have thus advanced
him from the dawn ot life, to the period for literary pursuits, he
is placed under the tuition of a careful inftruftor, who nurtures
the pliant bud ot genius, and teaches the young idea how to Jhoot. His
inclinations are direÂ£ted to rule and order, and his reason led to
acquiesce in the necessity of subordination. His hope is quickened
into expectation ot reward fuitableto his merit; and his ambition
ftimulatcd to surpass in every laudable pursuit : He is patient and
diligent in his ftudics, and endeavours to leiToirthe talk of his in
llruttors by the docility of his disposition, and the placidncls of
his temper : Competitors excite his emulation : He becomes sus
ceptible of honor, and is a&uated by gcnerofity and the finer fen
tnnents of a cultivated mind. Though he finds the firft stages in
the road to science rugged and dillicult, and meets with more
thorns than roses, yet as he advances, the way bccomes pleasant,
and new profpetl* rife, decked with all the luxuriance of thought,
and thf ple<ifiug images of imagination. Being conscious that he
is travelling the load to fame, as well as intelle&oal pleasure, he
becomes invincible in his resolution for diflindtion, and alliduous
in his progress. He now confidcis his accidence and grammar,
and the rudiments of language, as avenues to the temple of Know
ledgeâfor being no longer embarrafTed by mere words, he ascends
to the ideas they represent. His understanding gradually unfolds
ana brightens, and he becomes enamoured with knowledge by
its increase. Now the harmonious didtion and chafle sentiments
of Virgil win his approbation ; now the address and politeness
of H'or ace begin to charm, and now the sublime majesty ot Ho
mer, and the tranfeendent eloquence of immortal Tu lly fire his
bosom with fcientific rapture. At this period he looks back with
lurprife upon the dark Itate of his ignorance, and is charmed with
the light of erudition. And the sensation it produces in him,inay
perhaps not unaptly be compared to those which travellers exper
ience, who after wandering in some dreary desert, fatigued with
the asperity of the way, are luddeniy tranlported into a cultivated
country adorned with blossoms productive of delicious fruits, vocal
with melodious birds, Janned with salubrious gales, resplendent
with sunbeams, and replete with obje&sof the purcft delight.
Thus the young pupil goes on in his happy progress, until the
approbation of his inltruttors pronounces him fit to be transfered
to a higher feat of li erature, the Universityâin expeÂ£lation of
which, lome of us are soon to bid adieu to this institution, from
which we have derived so great advantage, and tootferan aftettion
ate farewell to our much refpe&cd inftruftors. I feel that I never
had more to fay, nor was it ever less in my power to express my
felf upon any occasionâWill youthen, ye guardians of literature,

Venerable fathers ot the town, under whose auspices we com

thanks for your presence this day : May our schools and colleges
never want patrons to support them, nor friends to protest the

and to myfelf, I wu'h that happiness that mult reiult from com
pleting an early education, and the advantage and pleasure that
will spring from the pursuit of that science and virtue, for the at

ORIGINAL SPECIMENS of ELOQUENCE.
I.
7"HE Editor 9 solicitous to minglennovelt y variety
and utility in his original M'fcellany , hopes the follow
ing example s r f Eloquence 9 exhibited in the negociation
of Treaties with the Indians fine: the ratification of the
independence of the United States, will be acceptable
to his readers.
At a Meeting of the Connniflioners of the United
States, in Nov. 1785, with the Head-Men and
Warriors of all the Tribes 01* T owns of the Che
rokees, the former addreiled the latter in the
following words:
" Head-Mf.k a\d Warriors of all the
c< Cherokf.es !
"WE are the men whom you were informed
came from Congress to meet you the Head-Men
and Warriors of all the Cherokees, to give you
peace and to receive you into the protection and
favor of the United States; and to remove, as iar
as may be, all causes of future contention and
quarrelsâthat you, your people, your wives and
your children may be happy ; and feel and know
the bleifings of the new change of Sovereignty
over this land, which you and we inherit.
" We sincerely wifti you to live as happily as
we do ourselves, and to promote that happiness
as far as is in our power ; regardless of any dif
tin (ft ion of colour, or ot any difference in our
manners, or particular situation.
*< This humane and generous A (ft of the Uni
ted States will 110 doubt be received by you with
gladness, and held in grateful remembrance : and
the more so, as many of your young men, and the
greateil number of your warriors (d uring the late
war) were our enemies, and alliiied the King of
Great-Britain in his endeavours to conquer our
country.
" You yourselves know that you refufed to lift en
to the good talks Congress sent you ; that the cause you
efpoujed was a bad one ; that all the adherents to the
King of Great-Britain are compelled to leave this
country, never more to return.
" Congress // now the Sovereign of all our
country, which we now point out to you on the
map. They want none of your lands, or
any thing e/fe which belongs to you ; and as an earnest
of their regard for you, we propofeto enter into
articles of a treaty PERFEC ILY EQUAL, and
conformable to what we now tell yon.
" If you have any grievances to complain of,
[ Publijbid on Wednsfday and Saturday. j
we will hear themâand take f'ucli measures in.
consequence thereof as may be proper. We ex
pect you will l'peak your minds freely, and look
upon us as the Representatives of your FATHER
and FRIEND the CONGRESS, who will fee jus
tice done you.âYou may now retire and reflect
on what we have told you ; and let us hear from
you to-morrow, or as loon as pofiible."
The next day the Tassel of Chota arose and ad
drejfed the CommiJJioners thus :
" I amgoingtolettheCominiffioners hear what
I have to lay to them. I told you yesterday, I
would do this to day. I was very much pleased
with the talk you gave us yesterdayâit is very
different from what I expeifted, when 1 left home.
Ihe Head-Men and Warriors are also equally
pleased with it.
" Now I shall give you my own Talk. I am
made of this earth, on which the GREAT MAN
ABOVE placed me to poflefs it: and what I am
about to tell you, I have had in my mind for many
years
" This Land, we are now on, is the Land we
were fighting for duringthe late contest, and the
GREAT MAN made it for us to subsist upon. You
must know, the Red People are the aborigines of
this land, and that it is but a few years since the
White People found it out. lam of the firlt flock,
as the Commissioners know, and a native of this
land. And the White People are now living on ic
as our friends. From the beginning of our firlt
friendship between the White and the Red Peo
ple be ads were given as an Emblem thereof: and
these are the beads I give to the commissioners
of the United States, as a confirmation of our
friendfhip ; and as a proof of my opinion of what
you yesterday told us.
(a string of white beads.)
" The Commiflioners have heard how the
White People have encroached on our lands, oil
every fide of us that they could approach.
" I remember the Talks I delivered at the
Long Island of Holfton : and I remember giving
our lands to Col. Chriftieand others, who treated
with us, and in a manner compelled me thereto,
in i 777. I remember the Talks to Col. Chriltie,
when I gave the lands at the mouth of Cloud's
Creek eighteen springs pall. At that treaty we
agreed upon the line near Lime-Stone. The V ir
ginia /ine and part from the mouth of Cloud's Creek
to Cumberland Mountain, near the Cap, were paid
for by Virginia. From Cloud's Creek a uiretft line
to the Chimney-top Mountain,thcnce to the mouth
of Big Lime-Stone 011 Nolichv. ky, thence to the
firjl Mountain about fix miles from the river 011 a
tine across the fun, was never paid for by the Ca
rolina, which joins the Virginia line.
" I wifli the Commissioners to know everything
that concerns us, as I tell nothing but the truth.
They, the People of North Carolina, have taken
our lands for no consideration ; and are now
making their fortunes out .if them. I have in
formed.the Commissioners of the lint I gave up.
The People of North Carolina and Virginia have
gone over it ; and encroached on our lands ex
preilly against our inclination. They have gone
over the line near Little River, and they have gone
over Nine-Mile Creek, which is but nine miles from
our TOWNS. I am glad of this opportunity of
getting redress from the Commissioners. If Con
grels had not interposed, I and my people must
have moved. They have even marked the lands
on the bank of the river the Town where I
live ; and from thence down in the fork of the
and Holjlon.
" 1 have given in to you a detail of the abuse
and encroachments of these two States. We shall
be fatisfied if we are paid for the lands we have
given up: but will not, Â»or cannot ps
any moreâl mean the line I gave to Col. Christie.
" I have no more to fayâbut one of our belo
ved women has, who has borne and raised up War
riors."
The War-Woman of Chota then addrejfed the Com
miJJioners :
" I am fond of hearing that there is a Peace ;
and I hope you have now taken us by the hand in
real friendfhip. I have a Pipe and a little Tobac
co to give the Commissioners to smoke in friend
fhip. I look on you and the Red People as my
C HILDREN. Your having determined on Peace
is moll pleasing to me ; for I have seen much
trouble duringthe war. lam old, but 1 hope yet
to bear childrenâwho will grow up and people
our nation ; since we are now to be under the
protection of Congress, and shall have no more
disturbance.
" The talk I have given is from the Young
Warriors I have raised in my Town, as well as
myfelf. They rejoice that we have Peace ; and
we hope the chain of friendfhip will never more be
broken."By Authority.
ORDINANCE,
RESPECTING LIBERTY TO TRADE WITH THE SOUTH
â¢ ERN PART OF ST. DOMINGO.
NINTrfOF MAY, 1789.
Ext raft from the Regijlers oj the Superior Council oj Sti Domingo.
THE tour which the Governor General has lately mride to
the southern parts, has enabled him to judge personally of the si
tuation to which they arc reduced, as well as of the only efficaci
ous means to raise them to that degree of splendor they are sus
ceptible of. He has observed, that the bounty of two hundred
livres, granted by the Arret of the King's Council of State, dated
the 25th of September, one thousand, fcvcn hundred and eighty
fix, which expires the ill of Angufl next, for every negro that is
imported, so iar from becoming a means of encouragement, has
fcarc.ely fufficed to replace the annual deficiencies by sickness and
desertion ; and has not given that activity to the commercial spe
culations of France, that was cxpeÂ£led. That this trade requires
the cargoes to be rigorously paid for in money, or to fell them from
twenty-five to thirty ptr cent. dearer, if they are paid for with
produce, and that by continuing the excluiive privilege of the
southern parts, they will be always in a langui filing fituacion,
without circulating money, and will never be able to derive from
themselves the riches they pofTcfs.
That on the other hand, this quarter which is as fine as the
northern and western, only requires in order to become as fruitful,
a degree of flrength which it now wants ; That by encreafing the
number of nezjoes by importation,- the land will become as pro
ductive as the other quarters ; that the King will derive a consi
derable sum by the duties which will be levied on the articles
>mported and exported, and the inhabitants will encreafe their
fortunes, and will extricate themselves from their unfortunate situ
ation, and at the fame time acquireeafe and tranquility : That the
National commeice will be enabled hereafter to extend itfelf in this
quarter and reimburse itfelf the sums which may be due to it.
On mature rcfle&ion of all thefc considerations, the unanimous
â¢wilhof the inhabitants for a free importation of negroes, the per
feÂ£l confidence we have, that it will produce the bell effects, and
that the commerce of France will only cease its operations for a
time, in order to derive hereafter greater activity and conliftency,
and that the southern part will produce within itfelf immenlc
riches, from which the King, the inhabitants, and commerce will
derive the greatest advantages ; We the General and Intendant,
by virtue of the powers entrufled to us, and with His Majesty's
good plcafure, have provisionally enabled and ordained, and we
do enadt and ordain, as follows, viz.

In committee of the whole.
The bill providing for the settlement of ac

Rtfoived,. as the sense of this committee, That
an executive department ought to be eftablilhed,
to be denominated the Home Departmentâthe
head of which to be called the Secretary of the
United States for the Home Department âwhole
duties shall be, to correspond with the several
States, and fee to the execution of the laws of
the Unionâto keep the great seal, and affix the
fame to all public papers when neceilaryâto keep
the lefier seal, and to affix it to commiflions, &c.
to make out commiflions and enregifterthefaule ;
âto keep authentic copies of all public acts, and
transmit the fame to the several Statesâto pro
cure the a<fis of the several States, and report on

to iilue patents, &:c. âand in general to do, and
attend to, all fucli matters and things, as he nW)
be directed to by The President.
This resolution was warmly oppofed,by ?.lefli s.
White, Benson, Sedgwick, Gerry, Hun

The several duties fpecified, were particular J
refered to, and it was observed, that they wouW
very properly come within the limits of the great
branches of the legislature, or of thoie execu

of the objects were not eflential âIt was urge,
that there are offices enough already eflablilie

that he may more effectually observe the move

he obferved,that this would be a plan of economy :
information 011 these points is neceilary to be
badâand the question is, whether a contidentiaj
officer is not a better medium, than vague inform,
ation, by letters fromperfons, perhaps intei efteci
to deceive. He then adverted to the several du
ties to Ihew their importance, that they are not
comprized in any oliice already constituted, and
could not with any propriety come under the cog
nizance of those departments. Mr. Vining
pointedly disclaimed all personal motives, i;i
bringing forward this bulincfsâhe came forth, he
observed, upon the broad basis of the public good.
The motion for striking out the clause, beinÂ»
put, palled in the affirmative.âThe committee

Mr. Sedgwick introduced a motion that a

This motion after some debate was negatived,
and then the House adjourned.

UPON THE MANU FACTURE OF GLASS.
BO 1 FLES, blackor green, are tliemoftfim
ple of all the glass manufactureâthe profit in
naking which depends upon the greatelt number
of workmen being employed at the smallest ex
,:>enfe of fuel. From eight to sixteen blowers can
work all at once, at one melting furnace, fix feet
iiameter, which Mill take fixcordsof wood every
wenty-four hours. The belt coiiftrufted green
glafi furnace in this country is in New-Jerseyâ
where the whole business of smelting, blowing,
and cooling is done with one fire, by the particu
lar conllrmftion of the furnace.
WHI FE GLASS may also be made in the fame
furnace : but it is much more curious in its com
pofitio'n : for to make it white, it must partake
;>f all the coloursâfor this reasonâin smelting
the purest materials, they naturally have a green
ish and purplish tinge ,â¢ to dislodge which a black
illi foffil fubltance is made use ofâupon this prin
ciple, that one colour in glass making will destroy
another ; so that at last a beautiful glass is produ
ced called -white ; but like the chriftaline humour
of the eye, it partakes of all the colours, as may
be fcen in the best Englilh white glass, which has
a changeablenefs like soap bubbles ; but in the
best London crown glass, or mirrours, you will
not perceive any of that fpaikling, changeable
power, because it would distort the object fefcn
through or reflected, on account of the refracting
power of such glass ; therefore this is made
of pure salts and sand only and has a native
greyifli colour, as maybe feenby the broken pieces
that, like water, they may reflect the objeifts tru-
Jy-
CROWN GLASS may be made here to greater
profit than any other glassâon account of the
plenty and cheapness of materialsâthe quantity
that can be madeâand the great consumption of
it.âThe method of making whichâform and di
menfionsof the furnaceâpreparations of the ma

tedious sickness has deprived me of the small re

WEALTH EXAMINED.
[Continued from our
AN ariitocracy, like tlie Roman senate, be
tween the abolition of royalty and the inltitution
of the tribunate, is of itfelf a faction, a private
partial intereit. Yet it waslefs fotlian an aliem
bly annually chosen by the people, and vested
with all authority, would be ; for l'uch an aflem
bly runs falter and easier into an oligarchy than
an hereditary ariltocratical aflembly. The lead
ing members having, as has been before shewn in
detail, the appointment of judges, and the nomi
nation to all lucrative and honorable offices, they
have thus the power to bend the whole executive
and judicial authority to their own private in
tereit, and by tliefe means to increase their own
reputations, wealth, and influence, and those of
their party, at every new election : whereas, in
a simple hereditary ariltocracy, it is the intereit
of the members in general to preserve an equality
among themselves as long as they can ; and as
they are smaller in number, and have more know
ledge, they can moreealily unite for that purpose,
and there is no opportunity for any one to in
crease his power by any annual elections. An
aspiring arillocratic therefore mult take more
time, and use more address, to augment his in
fluence : yet we find in experience, that even
hereditary ariltocracies have never been able to
prevent oligarchies riling up among them, but by
the most rigorous, severe and tyrannical regula
tions, l'uch as the institution of inquilitions, &c.
It may found oddly to lay that the majority is
a fadtion ; but it is, neverthelels, literally just.
If the majority are partial in their own favour, if
they refufe or deny a perfect equality to every
member of the minority, they area faction : and
as a popular aflembly, collective or reprei'entative,
cannot aCt, or will, but by a vote, the firlt (tep
tuey take, if they are not unanimous, occasions a
divilion into majority and minority, that is, intd
two parties, and the moment the former is unjult
itisa faJtion. The Roman decemvirs themselves
were let up by the people, not by the senate :
much longer time would have been required for
an oligarchy to have grown up among the patri
cians and in the senate, if the people had not
interposed and demanded a body of laws, that is, a
conltitution. The senate oppoled the requilition
as long as they could but at last appointed the
decemvirs, much againll their own inclinations,
and merely in compliance with the urgent cla
mours of the people. Nedham thinks, that "as
" the firlt founders of the Roman liberty did well
<Â£ in driving out their kings; 10, on the other
" fide, they did very ill in fettling a standing
" authority within themselves." It is really very
injudicious, and very ridiculous, to call those Ro
man nobles who expelled their kings, founders of
the Roman liberty : noteing was farther from
their heads or their hearts than national liberty ;
it was merely a Itruggle for power between a
king and a body of haughty envious nobles ; the
intereit of the people and of liberty had no Ihare
in it. The Romans might do well in driving out
their king : he might be a bad and incorrigible
character ; and in such a cafe any people may do
well in expelling or depoling a king. But they
did not well in dcmolifhing the lingle executive
magiltracy : they should have then demanded a
body of laws, a definite constitution, and an in
tegral lhare in thelegillature for the people, with
a prccife delineation of the power of the firlt ma
giltiate'and senate. In this cafe they would have
been entitled to the praise of founders of Roman
liberty : but as it was, they only substituted one
fyltein of tyranny for another, and the new one
was worse than the old. They certainly " did
" very ill in fettling a Itandingfovereigu l'upreine
" authority within themselves." Thus far our
author is perfectly in the right, andtlie reason he
gives for this opinion is very well founded : it is
the fame that was given thousands of years before
him, by Plato Socrates, and others, and has been
conltantly given by all succeeding writers in fa
vour of mixed governments, and againlt simple
ones, " because, lying open to the temptations of
" honor and profit," or, in other words, haying
their ambitijn and vanity, avaiiceand lust, hatred
and resentment, malice and revenge, in jfliort
their felt-love, and all their paifions (" which are
" fails too big for any human bulk") unrestrain
ed by any controuling power, they were at once
transported by them ; made use of their public
power not for the good of the commonwealth, but
tor the gratification of their private pallions,
whereby tliey'put the commonwealth into frequent
flames of discontent and fediiion. Thus far is
very well : but when our author goes 011, " which
" might all have been prevented, could they
" have fettled the ltate free, indeed, by placing
" an orderly fuccedion of supreme authority in
" the hands of th<; people," he can be followed
by 110 one who knows what is in man, and in
societyâbecause that supreme authority falls out
of the whole body into a majority at the firft vote.
To exped: fell-denial from men, when they have
a majority in their favour, and consequently
power to gratify themselves, is to diibelieve all
history and universal experience ; it is to tiiibelieve
Revelation and the Word of God, which informs
us, the heart is deceitful above all things, and
desperately wicked. There have been examples
of (elf-denial,and will be again; but l'uch exalted
virtue never yet exilted in any large body of men
and lalted long : and our author's argument re
quires it to be proved, not only that individuals,
but that nations and majorities of nations, are ca
pable not only of a iingle aift, or a few aifts of
disinterested justice and exalted felf-denial, but
of a course of l'uch heroic virtue for ages and ge
nerations ; and not only that they are capable of
this, but that it is probable they will pra<flife it.
There is 110 man lo blind as not to lee, that to
talk of founding a government upon a fuppofiti
-011 that nations and great bodies of men, left to
themselves will practiie a course of felf-denial,
is either to babble like a new-born infant, or to
deceive like an unprincipled impoltor. Nedham
hasliimfelf acknowledged, in leveral parts of this
â¢work, the depravity of men in very ftrongterms.
In this fifth reafonhe avers " temptations of 11011-
" our and profit to be fails too big for any human
" bulk." Why then does he build a system on
a foundation which he owns to be f'o unliable ?
If his mind had been at liberty to follow his own
ideas and principles, he must have seen that a
fuccelfion of supreme authority in the hands of
the people, by their house of representatives, is
at firlt ail ariltocracy asdefpotical as a Reman se
nate, and becomes an oligarchy even sooner than
thatallembly fell into the decimvirate. There is
this infallible disadvantage infucha government,
even in companion with an hereditary ariltocra
cy, that it lets in vice, profligacy and corruption,
like a torrent, with tyranny ; whereas the latter
often guards the morals of the people with the
utmost leverity : even the despotism of arilto
cracy prelerves the morals of the people.

An ESSAY on FREE TRADE and. FINANCES.
[Continued from No. XXVI.J
I come now to the confide ration of the prac
ticability of the mode of taxation which I propo
lied, ami which 1 do conceive is a matter of ca
pital weight in this di scullion, for which I do re
ly on these two grand propositions. ilt. That
whatever is the real, great interest of the peo
ple, they may, by proper measures, be made to
believe and adopt: And, 2d. That whatever is
admitted to be a matter of common and important
interest, in the general opinion of the people,
may be easily put in practice, by wisdom, pru
dence, and due management of the affairs. I do
contend, that when this tax is fairly proposed to
the public, with a proper elucidation of the evils
it avoids, and the advantages which result from
it, it will not be looked on as a burden of opprel
fion, aniinpolition of power, but as the purchase
of our molt precious blelfings, as a measure abso
lutely neceilary to our molt cliential and impor
tant interelts ; therefore any attempt to avoid this
tax, by smuggling or any other way, will be
deemed by general consent, anatft of meanness ;
an avoidance of a due share of the public burden;
si ultrating the neceilary plans of public fafety,
and rendering ineffectual the public measures
adopted by general conlent, for the public secu
rity, tranquility and liappinefs. isucli an action
implies in it gieat meanness of character in the
agent, and a high crime against the State, and
the detection of it will be conlidered as a very
material service to the commonwealth. Where
any actions are deemed crimes, scandals and nui
sances by the general voice of the people, detec
tions and informations against them are reputa
ble ; they cease to be infamousâthe infamy of an
informer does not take place in such instances.
The reasons of governmental measures ought
always to attend their publication lb far as to af
ford good means of conviction to the people at
large, that their objeCt and tendency is the public
good. This greatly facilitates their execution
and success. 'Tis hard governing people against
their interests, their persuasions, and even againlt
their prejudices. 'Tis better to court tlicir un
derltaiuhngs lirlt withreafon, candor and sinceri
ty, and we may be almolt lure all their pailions
will follow loon. I abhor a mysterious govern
ment. I think an adminiltration, like a private
man, which affeifts to have a great many iecrets
that must not be explained, has generally agreat
many faults which will not bear telling ; or a great
deal of corruption, which will not bear exami
ning. Government, like private persons, may
indeed have l'ecrets, which ought to be kept so ;
but in that cafe, caution lhoulii be used against
any intimations or hints getting abroad, even
that there are such l'ecrets, or any lecrets:
for this would produce an anxious enquiry and
folicitousinfpeCtion, which mightmake the keep
ing thefecret more difficult, and besides bring on
many other inconveniencies arising from imm
berlefs apprehensions, which such acircumftance
would give birth to. An oltentatious given out
that there are mighty l'ecrets in the cabinet, or
many myitcries in the State that must not be pry.
Ed too clofcly into, is the very contrary of all this,
and generally is a sign of a weak adminiltration,
and not seldom of a corrupt one; Lut of n
lie measures, which require explanations'r/f"
people, that of taxes, which touches their
ney, which is always a very sensible pa a tto '
Hand as chief; and to make these <r 0 ' R:; - v
thing well, 'tis always neceilkry to tore-id ,
verlal conviction, ill. That the money
in taxes is neceflary for the public , ,
2 dly, 1 hat it will certainly be fX) >' Â® 1
only on the objects for which 'tis a Iked aucUivl,
and if these two things are really Â°.i '
will rarely be much difficulty in making iw" 6

commonwealth ; but of these two things e J
are not really true, or not really and geneJk
beheved, I dont know that a 11 anding army v, u( ,|d
be fufhcient to collect the taxes. I ain 0 f 0 â¢ â¢

When ever they ilrall go away, I i mag fâ e the L ;
will find that they have left behind themi:ifi n i tt :
ly more abhorrence than obedience amonÂ® the
people. Though lam clearly of opinionÂ°that
there mult exilt an ultimate force or power of
compulsion in every effective and good govern
ment, yet 'tis plain to me, that such force is ne
ver to be put in a<ftion against the general convic
tion or opinion of the people ; nor indeed do 1
believe it es er can be so exercifed,with fuccefsand
final efl'eifl, for every attempt of this kind tends to
convulsions and death. Such an ultimate force in
deed ought to fall upon and correct tliofe whofia
against the peace, interest and security of the
public, but this can be done with fafety and ad
vantage only in cases where the crime pumfhed
is against the opinions, the sentiments and moral
or political principles, which generally prevail
in the people ; for if the moll violent declaimer
and mover of feditioh in a government, fliould
happen to be received by the people as a patriot,
and his harangues fliould be eagerly adopted a?
the doctrines of their liberties and rights, anyat
tempt topunilh him would be in vain or ufeleft;
foreitherthe people would interpose and refcije
him, or if he was puniihed, they would consider
hnn as the martyr of their cause, and thereby the
public uneasiness, tumult and uproar would be
augmented.

THE NATIONAL MONITOR. No. XIV.
" Self-love but fcrves the virtuous mind to wake.
As the lmall pebble stirs the peaceful lake ;
The centre mov'd, a circle straight succeeds.
Another still, and still another spreads;
Friend, parent, neighbour, fii ft it will embrace,
Its country next; and next all human race ;
Wide and more wide, th' overflowings of the mind
Takes ev'ry creaturc in of, ev'rv kind ;
Earth imiies aiound with boundlcfs bounty blest,
And Heav'n beholds its image in its brcaft."
THE words local attachment, an J partial pr?->
judices,have hadfuch a peat rung upon them, that the)
now jornt the mojt uncertain and confufed found ima
ginable : But so far at they are understood with
any precifton, they convey an idea that is almtfi itn'i
verfally reprobatedâwith how much reason will a(-
pear, when it is considered that very jew of the hw
man race are without those attachments and preju
dices ; and if they generally were, the condition of
humanity would be altered infinitely for the worse.
The truth is, those attachments are interwoven lit
the very texture of our natures by the Author of Ex
ijtence, and subserve the mo ft valuable and important
purposes ; to these we are indebted for the noblejl ex
ertions of the human mind, and they prove the fpritl
of the fine ft enjoyments of life.
There are but few minds so capaciously formed, is
to embrace the interests of a large community, in such
manner as to enter into all their enjoyments and dif
trejfes, with those lively sensations which fyvipathy ex
cites for a friend, a family, or a neighbourhood. It"
generally true, that in proportion to the txpanfion if
what is called the philanthropic principle, in the fane
proportion it is faint and inoperativeâand a perfo"
totally dejlitute of local and partial attachments, viill
want the amor patria in the bejl sense of the words.
It is not intended by these remarks to advocate a eon
trafted and felfifh principleâthey are not dejigned
to fanftion that local policy, which shuts up the oejt af
fections of the heart, and confines every benevolent
wish to the spot where we were bom, or to the par
ticular circle with which we happen to be more particu
larly connelled.âThey are dejigned to abate that
ardour of spirit which proscribes all partialities and
predilections,however jnftjfiable ; for we deceive our-
J'eves byf'ppofing that : heje attachments can be anni
hilated, or that it wouldJerve any valuable pnrpofe
life if they could.
As in the genera! administration of human affairs,
the be ft interejt of society is promoted by every indivi
dual's purfutng with steadiness, andperjeveranc ' their
own particular advantage in conformity to the laws---
so the great objects of patriotism are mojt essential'/
advanced, by the attachments which are difcovere ty
every person to the state, the country, the town,
neighbourhood, the family, &c. with which they are
more immediately connefiedâthis is nature,reafon/' 1
common sense.
