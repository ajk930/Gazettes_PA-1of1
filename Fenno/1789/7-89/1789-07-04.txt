t , Jfter the middle age of life, it is not probable a
man will find happiuefs in such oeyMs, as have be
'fore been unpleajantto him."
â T DO not blame my situation, but my temper
I r or the difcontentinent I feel. My re#et
â¢ all terminate in felf-difapprobation. I fuf-
Sded every enjoyment in my younger days
P"' I nl ight amass a fortune, with which I could
iicrience the delights of leisure and indulgence
"ft interruption. But lam now fatisfied that
Z only way H> be ha PPy in old a ? e is to , culti :
' e habits of innocent amusement m youth, and
roiafte enjoyment as we go along. By this means,
Â° need not in the latter part of lite counteract
the customs that have become familiar to us in
the former. . .
Â« My misfortune consists in having, m my ear
ly veals of mankind, rejee'led and despised the
nailing pleasures of the clay, that I might be more
completely prepared for an undilturbed indul
gence in future gratification. Sadly however am
1 deceived ! I can form no relish for fucli new ob
jects as my new situation presents.
Â« Leifureis dreadful; because I have hitherto
been intensely busy. Reading does not destroy
inch tedioufnefs ; because I have not formerly
been delighted with books. Conversation is un
interelling; becanfe I used to (hun it, in order to
follow my business. Rural occupations and scenes
captivate me not; because I did not fuffer my fell
to be pleased with them, when I was young.
" If I visit myneighbours and find how content
ed the v are, a tl how they envy my easy circum
stances, lam out of all patience with myfelf. It
is now the chief object of my care to impress on
the minds of my children the neceflity of habitu
ating themselves to love conversation ; to love in
nocent pall-time and amusement; to cherish an
inclination for books ; and indeed to raifean at
tachment to many other habits that are always
within the reach of every one, and which are in
offenlive ifnotinunediately ufeful. By this prac
tice of genuine philosophy, they become gradual
lyand fafely familiarized to enjoyments, ofwhich
they mean to participate more liberally,when ad
vance of fortune will permit, and an advance of
years will authorise.
" Fhofe who pass away life as they ought will
fuidall parts of it more equally pleasant than is
commonly imagined. The dilgulls and loss of
plealure attending old age are principally occa
lioned by improper habits and falfe hopes,that are
formed in our youthful days. Men begin a ca
reer of life which, they will tell you, is unplea
fantor perhaps vicious, resolving to lay aside their
vices or improve their pleasures at some future
time, when it is more convenient. Here lies the
mistake ; they are lb controuled by cuftoin that
they niuft end their days, as they began tliem ;
andconfequently they will not probably be hap
py and virtuous when they are old, if they were
not so, when they were young. Whenever we
fee an old man miserable, we must not of course
conclude that age is the cause of it, but mult at
tribute it to the prevalence of palt errors.
" I have never habituated myfelf to take latis
faCtion iu any thing but pursuits of business.
My activity in fomemeafurc fails me, and toil and
anxiety are .becoming insupportable ; but Hill I
can find no fabllitute that is not more dilagreea
ble. None ofthe habits of my youth are suitable
to carry with me into old age. The last periods
of my life will therefore yield me little consola
tion. Lvery man should accustom himfelftoen
joy the innocent pleasures that fall in his v ay, as
they present themselves, even if it a little inter
feres with acquisitions of property. I am far
from atlvifing aperfon to a course of extravagance
or dillipation, or to an indolent, vicious life ; but
there are many gratifications not incompatible
with virtue, and not materially detrimental to
interest. Men destined to hard labour have not
much occafioil for this precaution, as any change
ofcircuinftances with thein will be for the better,
lam speaking of those who are extensively enga
ged in profitable operations ; and who constantly
iubject themselves to felf denial, with a view, as
they fay, of enjo yinglife hereafter in greater per
fcftion. But let me tell them from experience
that no incident can afford tliem pleasure, that
counteracts their pall habits ; and that the true
? rt Â°f happinei's conlilts in innocently snatching
u, as we go along, from whatever offers. Those
who gain fatisfaction from anticipating happy
avs are in a fair way to disappointment. No
are happy toamind difqualified by old ha
ws fj 01n tailing such gratifications, as theprefent
period or present circumflances can afford."
m 1 le lc ader will determine forhimfelf whether
J a c ?" e rPÂ°^ en t or my preacher has taken the
"eft fide ofthe question.
SATURDAY, July 4, 1789.
On the COIN of the UNITED STATES.
IF the unit dollar was made worth exactly 100
difmes of the value of" the English. half-pence,
it would be then sod. sterlingâand sterling stand
ard is, according to Sir Isaac Newton (mailer of
the mint, in 1716) the standard of England,
France, Holland and Spain ; which I therefore
call the commercial standard, or the standard of
the commercial countries, which ought to be ob
served by us who are to trade chiefly with them.
Our Congress dollar has more of alloy than the
commercial standard, the gold has the fame al
loy : Yet one dollar has so little of alloy more
than sterling, that it is of less consequence than
the former deviation in the cent weighing but
IS7 I_ 2gr. of copper, when the English halfpence
is 166 gr. of copper. If one cent was 166 grains,
it would be equal to the English halfpence ; and
then 100 cents or halfpence making a dollar,
would give it the sterling value of sod. (or 10c
cents or half pence.) The division into tenths ol
account and coin, is wonderfully convenient. How
easy to multiply and divide 16849 cents by dots
aloneâa dot rednces it to difmes and centsâano
ther dot to dollars, &c. thus : 16. 8. 4., 9 are
eagles, dollars, &sc.
The coin of the United States reduced into ster
ling, (which is the standard finenefs of the great
commercial nations, France, Britain and Holland,
with whom wemuft traffic) would stand thus :
s. d. Sterling.

Monies of account are dollars, difmes, cents ;
and are wrote
Dol. di. cent.
463 9 8
689 6 4
"53 6 Â« , . .
But money of account may be kept 111 only
one column, that is in cents or mills ; which are
instantly thrown into other denominations by the
simple application of dots, thusâYou receive 3
Eagles, 9 dollars, 7 centsâEnter those figures
in your book without any dot, when they will be
read 3907 cents, the cypher filling the place of
difmes ; or read it 3 eagles, 9 dollars, 7 cents ;
or 39 dollars, 7 cents.
Mills, cents and difmes in columns never have
more than one figure in the line ; for, asoftenas
they amount to 10, the tens are carried forward
and the unites are placed in the column. The
above table is of a dollar of the value of 5 od. al
though we arc to have dollars coined that are
fractional respeCting both English and trench
monies : J2d. 64-iooths do not answer exacftly to
livres, and less to sterling pence or shillings.
The Congress division of monies being in an
exacfl decimal method, admits of multiplication
and division by only placing dots or taking them
away. It is the quickest, most certain and easy
way of reduction, both for the learned and un
learned. Those who can read figures, may avail
themselves of the simple application of dots for
throwing Congress money from mills or cents
into dollars, difmes and cents, or into eagles, dol
lars, difmes, cents, and mills, thusâl46B9 cents
are changed into the liiger by
dots : A dot on the left of the unit's place gives
difmes and cents, 1468.9 ; another dot on the left
of the ten's place, gives dollars, difmes and cents
140.8.9. If eagles are 10 be paid, another dot on
the left of tin. hundred's place, give eagles, dol
lars, difmes and cents 14.6.8.9. â Tliefeare again
thrown into money of account by writing or
reading the figures without the dot for eagles,
146.8.9 ; or if your accounts are kept in only one
column, of ccnts, omit all the dots, 14689.
Interelt and commiHion how easily reckoned !
5 per cent. 011 the above sum of 146.8.9 or
14689, amounts to 7dol. 3di. 4cent. 45-100.

The convenience would be great 111 having the
unit dollar at the value of scd. exactly : a cent
would then be a halfpenny fterlingâlf the dol
lar be worth more or less than jod. equal to ico
cents, it will, without neceflity, fractions,
that will be inconvenient in exchanging. The
present declared dollar is worth 52d. 64100 of a
penny sterling. The value of gold and silver
coins is only to tlx; amount ot the fine metal.
Alloy is used onfy for the purpose of hardening
them, and is of y ety minute value when separa
ted ; it otherwise is a disgrace to those preci
ous metals. The Congress dollar contains 375
64-100 grains of fine silver, and 34 15-100 ol
copper. The orly standard Spanish dollar dilcov
ered by Sir Ifafcc Newton, is the old pillar piecc
of eight, wh" _h contains of fine silver 38? 72-100,
and of alloy 27J-100 grains, worth exactly
rPublifhed on Wediiefday a/id Saturday.]
I 53d. 87-100, but palled currently for J4d. âA
dollar of 358 i-xo and 29 35-1000 al
i loy, would be of the fame standard finenefs, and
worth jod. exatftly, and divides into tens, in c
ven numbers, without deviating from well known
monies of the foreigners, great iii commerce,
with whom we mult have Commerce even againlt
prejudices.âThe dollar of J2d. 64-100 agrees,
nearly, with the livre ; 5 of them making such a
dollar within 1 4-100 of & penny, wheli the livre
is at iod. 1-2 sterling : And the dollar of jod. a
grees exaCtly with pence sterling ; which again ex
aft/yzgrees with cents : For, jod.being a dollar, 100
cents are jod. the one attends money that is per
manent, never varyingâthe other regards mo
ney that is less fixed. Monies that are the lcaft
fixed, are the molt suitable to gamesters and Iharp
ers ; such too are coins of inferior finenefs to the
standard of the great commercial nations ; be
it ever so (mail, it (lamps a stigma on it; clipc
coins are also the best creatures of those (harpers.
The debts and contracts among some
of people of the United States at present, gene
rally (land stated in sterling money, or in the cur
rent monies of the relpedtive States, under the
old denomination of pounds, (hillings, and pence :
Some however are in dollaisâthat is Spanilh.
pieces" of tight of the value of J4d. sterling.
Many millions of accounts of those debts are,
henceforward, to be reduced from those
minationsto Congrels dollars, difmes and cents fai
as to preserve the value of the debts. How is this
last to be done ? Will it be as readily perform
ed as if the Congress dollars were of the exact
value of jod. and the cent of the exaÂ»il value of
a halfpenny sterling ?
Our citizens well know what pence sterling are,
that J4 of them are equal to a Spanilh piece of
eight, and 108 halfpence are also of that value;
and the people of every State know the par of
exchange between the dollar in sterling and in
the currency of the Stateâthat the dollar of J4d.
sterling is, in the middle States, equal to'9od.
currency, See.âSo that if the Congress dollar was
exa&ly worth jod. sterling, its cents Would be
equal to halfpence ; and all sterling debts thrown
into halfpence, are at once turned into Congress
money. An instance : A is to pay a debt, of
Â£.J4 6 8 sterling, in Congress money. Thac
sum contains 13040 pence, or 26080 halfpence,
that is cents ; which by dots are thrown into
260.d0. B.di. o.c.âlf a debt is in Currency.
Â£.90 II 1, of the United States, 7/6 the Spanilh
dollar, then by firft reducing into halfpence, and
fubftradting 2-Jths, you have 26080 cent ; /. e.
260.d01. 18.di. oc. equal to Â£.90 11 1 currency.
There maybeclearer and more concise methods ;
but, this is noted off hand.
It is not surprizing that objections fliould be
made by simple people, to the change of terms
from'Â£. 1. d. to Dol.difwes,cents âBut,a(liiredly,the
divisions into tens (with those new terms) will
presently become familiar, and are the rnoft ex
cellent above those of all other nations, for rea
dy and corrccft reckoning, to the unlearned as
well as the learned. It is the molt natural and
harmonious division ever discovered. Some object
to the columns of account requisite for
separating Dol. dif. cents ; that inconvenience
will flow from the usÂ« of three columns, they at
present using only two, for dollars and ninetieths ;
but,three columns they have been used to in Â£. d. s.
However, the Congress money admits of those
people, and all others, pleafuig themselves by a
choice of columns from 4 or J down to one : Of
which here follow specimens :

How plain and simple this last.âDots will di
vide the sum as you please.
The eagle containing 10 dollars of jod. (fee
table) is worth 2 guineas, French or Englilh, and
rather more. The Englilh guinea, current at 21s.
iterl. is only worth 20s. Bd. or iod. according to
Sir Isaac Newton, who by the bye, aliens, that
the finenefs of French, Englilh and Dutch money,
is so nearly alike, that heconfiders it the fame in
them all, in standard goodness. Therefore fterl.
is a standard of the monies of the great commer
cial nations, and ought to be equalled, mo!t cx
attly, by the monies of the states.' B/SKJLICH OF THE POLITICAL STATE OF AMERICA.

HOWEVER opposed ic may be to the feelings
ana incereffcsof some individuals, ] am yet incli
ned to observe, that upon general principles, the
policy of emigrating to distant parts, from a coun
fiy, leit infufficiently stocked with people, to
answer the necellary demands arising in society,
cannot he easily jultified: Nor am 1 acquainted
with tne peculiar advantages which we are to de
rive from the prefeut rage for emigration so the
\\ eltern country, as a reimbursement of the valt
of its settlement ; but I presume these
(peculations will end 1 ke the Voyage of the shak
ing Quakers from one of the Eaftem States, who
piompted by holy zeal built a /hip to convey them
to Jerufalein,but eventually concluded to fend her
for a cargo ol rum to the Weft-Indies, as pronii
nlg the greatest profit. Though it Ihould be
granted that it is not altogether within the abili
ty of government to flop the delusive practice of
quitting habitations now unsettled, to visit regions
unexplored and unprotected ; yet there is an es
sential difference between a tacit connivance, and
an officious interposition to encourage such a plan.
I>. is added, that the irrefiflable ivipulfe of felfin
tereft, would prove superior to any attempts op
pofingfo strong a liobby-horfe ; but if some ac
counts lately had from Carthagena are to be re
lied on, little danger can arifc from giving full
.Â°pe to the operation of this irrefi [table principle,
in effecting those Utopian settlements. By an ex
press clauf'e of the National Conltitution, the re
publican form of government isguaranreedâand
the ellence and genuine principles of such a Go
vernment can be best supported within a fiiiall
compass, and where mutual interests are mutual
ly understood ; but when the territorial jurisdic
tion of a country is greatly extended, the emana
tions of power from its source becomes in the ex
ticinities proportionally weak and inefficient;
and must either, like the parts of the human sys
tem which are removed from the influence of the
blood expelled from the heart, end in their de
fection and final amputation; or if maintained, it
will be like the provinces of Rome by the tyran
ny of the Viceroys and consequent oppression of
the people ; and it will most probably be found
at some future period, that like the adder vivified
by the genial warmth of the fire, this country had
been cherished and reared to bite the hand of its
protector.
What a fad contrail does Spain now present to
her former fuuation, when flie flood foremo-ft
among the nations of Europe : and may we not
attribute this change to her rage for colonization,
and the miilaken policy of her government, in
encouraging itâJn return for folTdgreatnefs and

By ceding to the proposition that government

NEW INVENTED LOOM.
Extract of a letter front Edinburgh, April 18.
" A loom of anew and very Sngular nature has
lately been invented and set to work at PaifW
on the principles of a model conftrucled some
time ago l>y Dr. J affray, with the improvements
that have since occurred to him and Mr. Barr. This
loom is to be driven by machinery, set in motion
by water, fleam, &c. and not only takes the cloth
from the lay with such regularity that no part oi
the web can have more wool driven into it or be
thicker than another ; but if a thread in the warp
breaks, the machine instantly stands still. It is
laid to be capable of weaving all kinds of cloth.
fromfilk to canvas ; and, if report be true, it is
so iiniple 111 its conftrudtion as not to colt more
than double tlie expenee of a common loom, while
it is so sweet in its motions, and er.fy to be mana
ged, that one man working awheel can set five or
fix oi them in motion, and an attentive boy or
girl may tie threads and change pirns to three, if
not four. '1 he web at present in the loom is a ten
hundred muffin. The beauty and regularity of
its fabric have given much fatisfadtion to those
gentlemen in G1 lfgow and Paisley, to whom spe
cimens ofit have been fnewn : and we may ven
ture to fay, that nothing hitherto devised to im
prove and extend the art of weaving, to add new
energy to the labor and ingenuity of the country,
and to give a decided command of market, ever
demanded a more serious attention from all con
cerned."

SKETCH ofFKOCEEDIMOS of CONGRESS.
In the HOUSE of REPRESENTATIVES cj the
UNITED STATES.
Wednesday, July 1,1789.
MR. SHERMAN moved, that a clause be now
added to the bill for establishing the Treasury
Department, which should prohibit any of the
officers named in that bill from being either di
rectly or indirectly concerned in trade or com
merce : The clause was similar to the provision
made in the ordinance of Congress for eltablilh
jncr t he Board of Treasuryâthis was amended by
adding the fuliftance of Mr. Burke's motion,
which extends the prohibition to {'peculations in
public securities of all kinds,or in public lands, &c.
Mr. f 1 rzsi mons proposed a further amendment
by whichthcfe officers are not to exerci'fe any other
profeilion whatever, during the time they are in
laid department.
The proposed additiontotlie bill occasioned some
conversation, and there appeared to be a variety
offentiments among the members ; but on motion
of Mr. GiRRY to commit the clause, the vote palled
111 the negative by a great inajo< ity.
He then moved that the whole bill should be
committed : This also was negativedâafter which
Mr. Sherman's motion, *ith an addition propo
sed by Mr. Burke and Mr. Fitz.si mons, were
adopted.
The bill was then ordered to be engrofled for
a third reading to morrow.
A ineflage was received from the Senate with
the bill impoling duties 011 tonnage âthe Secre
tary informed the hop. Houfethat the Senate ad
hered to their third, fourth, fifth and sixth a
mendments, but at the fame time agreed to the
amendment of the House for laying a duty of 30
cents pr. ton on vellels built in America, and own
ed by foreigners.
The Secretary further informed,that the Senate
had appointed Mr. Wingat f to join a committee
011 the part of the Hon. House, to present the en
rolled bill, laying an Import on goods, wares, and
merchandize, to she Presiden i" for his appro
bation.
The House proceeded to the consideration of
the proposed amendments of the Senate to the
tonnage bill.
Mr. Gerry moved that the House should con
cur with the Senate in their thiid amendment,
Vhith was to Ihike out from the bill the clause
which discriminates in the duty upon tonnage,be
tween nations in treaty, and thole who are not.
This produceda (hort bu. animated conversation.
It was urged by ivli-.Sedg wick, Mr. Laurance,
Mr. Gerry, Mr. Jackson, and lbine others, that
the House had now the ultimatum of the Senate,
determined 011 by a large majority. That the
question involved a dilemma, whether the House
would concur with the Senate in amendments
which they had before rejected, but which fc
cured an abundant difcyiinination between Ame
rican and foreign {hip?, or would lofetlns impor
tant bill, which would be so productive, fonecef
faryto the regulation of trade, and to the jult and
equal balance of the whole impolt system : The
dilemma was easily lolved. The queltion was,
whether a finall good was to be preferred to a great
oneâwhether the \v;liole revenue ariling from the
American navigation Ihould be given up, for the
fake of exerciling a fanciful predilection and pre
ference of one foreign nation over apother. It
calculated that the produCt of the tonnage
jvoiild amount to 124,000 dollars. This was too
cruras an object to be neglected, even for alhort
time, without some important coii'penfation ; anil
e penally to he hazarded for the precarious hopes
'!"y other measures being deviled to embrace'
0 eurable a prize. The Senate had receded in
Â°me instances ; the obligation is mutual,and with
out lefe concelfions no object can ever be atcliiev
t was rtlrt her contended, that it was improper
ilL' Ia I *' ou ' c > i' l which the policy of a difcriin

Ap Â°â¢ ' e enate to f.icrifice their principles to
opinion of a Jingle man.
C as r tei,ded 0,1 the other flde by Mr - Ma "
c wren' INI,G al Â»d Mr. Pagh that a con
fttll aiwMri enate at th'S time, afterthree
the Hour 'â¢ , ei aie diicuflions and resolutions ol
without 6 '(" t ' l ' s difcriinination, and
duec a eh' , e L - V evv . ar gument advanced to in
tttifure ' ent inient, was an inconfillent
House. ; ln g ei ' ous tothe privileges of the
% -ould elkablifh, it was faicl, the worit
of precedentsâlt would establish a perpetual ar
gument for tlie l'ubmilhon of the representatives
co the Senate in any future differences.
The danger of losing the bill, it was conten
ded, was an argument that went to destroy the
balance of the constitution, as it always might
be urged when the Senate chose to persevere in
amending a bill contrary to the judgment of the
House, or of negativing any favorite measure of
this body.
To give way unconditionally in an important
matter, when no other reai'on was offered, but
the ultimate determination of the Senate, it was
affirmed, was a humiliation unworthy of the
House of representatives, and inconsistent with
their dignity.
lfitwerea measure of conciliation, it w as ob
ved, much might be plead in its favor. But it
bore none of the marks of a principle of accom
modation ; which was always understood to be a
meeting of the parties on some middle line, by
the mutual facrifice of particular principles or ob
jects.
It was further urged that it was not true that
a / ur . ther opposition would involve the neceflity
of losing the bill. It was to be hoped that it was
not yet too late to devise some mode of accommo
dating the differences; or if it was, yet if the
bill were sent back to the Senate, some conside
rations might induce them to recede, which, con
fidently withtlie rules of parliamentary proceed
ings, they might do previous to a second
rence.
On the question of concurrence, the yeas and
nays were called by Mr. Page, and the question
was carried by 31 against 19.
This concurrence being determined, the other
amendments followed, and were acceded to.
The committee appointed for the purpose re
ported a bill to regulate light-houses, beacons,
buoys, &c. which was read and laid on the ta
ble. Adjourned.
Thursday, July 2.
Mr. Partridge of the committee appointed
to examine the enrolled bill, for laying an im
port on goods, wares and merchandize imported
into the United States, reported that laid bill
had palled exam inationâwas corrected, and now
ready for the Speaker's signature.âA iimilar re
port was made reflecting the bill impoling a duty
011 tonnage.
A letter from The Baron Steuben, president
of the Cincinnati of the State of New-York, ad
drelied to the Speaker, requelting that the House
would honour the Society by their presence, at the
celebration of the 4th July, was read.

Mr. Gerry then introduced amotion, the pur

motion, fliould be ftruek out, and the following
words be substituted, " nor ihall any foreign

negatived.

which foreign vellels may enter.âThe commit

THE DAY!
In commemorating the present DISTINGUISHED DAY,
what additional motives to joy, and gratitude to Heaven, naturally
croud upon, and dilate the foul of every American. Our happr
nefs on every preceeding anniversary has been more or less inter
rupted, either by the din of war, orcivil discord : All those clouds
are now happily dispelledâa profpeft new and splendid dawns
upon us : Our common FATHER and DELIVERER, to whose
prudence, wisdom, and valour we owe our PEACE, LIBERTY,
and SAFETY, now leads and directs in the grand councils of the
nation, for their preservation. As the CONQUERER of our
enemies he is entitled to our praise : As the SUPPORTER and
DFFENDER of the rights of mankind, he is the jufi object of our
love, reverence, gratitude and cftecm. As we have crowned the
HERO with laurels, let us honor the PATRIOT by an humble
imitation of his exalted virtues. Let us rejoice that AMERICA
can boad a SON,
Whose loud-trumpt fame o'er the wide welkin rings,
And wakes to virtue the proud hearts of kings;
Remotest realms reverberate his name,
Stern Despots kindle with a patriot flame;
Their frigid bosoms new sensations warm,
And againd tyranny, e'en Tyrants arm.
HIS sacred fire, o'er all COLUMBIA dreams,
And FREEDOM balks beneath THE PATRIOT'S beams.
From all parts of the Union accounts agree, that THIS DAY
will be celebrated witVi a degree of hilarity and feftivity, hither
to unknown. We have had the name of Independenceâth efhadoto
without thefuijlance. As a nation, the Independence of the whole
wai suspended on the whims and caprices of a fuigle State, and
our individual, separate sovereignty and independrnce, were con
tinually infringed upon by partial and local regulations, which
were fubvtrfive of the dignity and independence of the Union.
This idea became so general at lad,that the people were convinced,
that they amused themselves with a found, whtle rhe profpeft of
real Independence was receding, and growing more uncertaiueverv
day. Thrs roused us to a&ion, to deliberation, to dccifionâand.
now we celebrate an tndependent Governmentâan original, inde
dependent Conditution ! an independent Legislature, at th. head
of which we THIS DAY celebrate THE FATHER OF HIS COUN
TRYâWe celebrate WASHINGTON ! We celebrate an INDE
PENDENT EMPIRE!
" Now lhall COLUMBIA lift her cheerful head,
'' Put forth the leaves of glad prosperity,
" And after all her gloomy scenes of grief,
" And fadaffli&ion. flourilh and revive,
" In all the bright fcrenity of peace."
In congratulating our readers upon this anniversary day of their
independence, we hope to excite the mod emotions.
When the citizcns of this nation have on former occafL-ns celebra
ted this memorable day, the ardor of their feftivity was checked
by the gloÂ£m and uncertainty of their polrtical prolpeth. A the
object of the revolution was not only Independence, but Govern
ment, our fucccfs mufthave been deemed incomplete at any period
before the adoption of the glorious cpnditmion. which itto secure
our liberty by giving rife to a fydem ofjuft legislation . With pe
culiar propriety may this our birtlj day be considered as a rnoft
elevated occasion of joy and congratulation. . Whether we reflect
on the vad and adomihing scenes through which we have piflTed
11l our progress through the war ; or whether we contemplate the
conspicuous advantages that offer themselves to our view in our
prclent fituatiou ; great mull be our admiration for the pad ! and
elevated our hopes for the future. On whatever fide we turn our
eyes the profpeft is bright and captivating. The spirit of peace
and accommodation that reign in the great bulk of our citizens;
the wisdom and patriotism of ouf legislative fathers ; the talents
and integrity that will charaftt rife the executive officers from the
mode of their appointment, and nobleexample of their illudrious.
head and director, are all circumllances that auth,orife us to indulge
in the gay scenes and amuf. mentsthat arc marked out for this auspi
cious day. It is however to be hoped that excess and indecency
of every description will be thattheennobling idea
that we are a free and virtuous as well as an ind pendent people,
will prevent our darning our chara&ers with vicious indulgence
or rude mirth and hilarity, and bringing reproach on a day which,
(hould be dedicated to joy and gratitude, rather than to diflipation
and intemperance. To associate in cheerful parties of feilivitv
li iwever is no unsuitable method of expressing the feelings which
rife out of the occasion. May we long continue to enjoy equal
reason lor amusement and congratulations !
We felicitate the public that The Pk zsjdent is so recovered
from hislateindifpofition.as to take the air in his carriage for se
veral days pad.
The people of the United Statesare didinguilhed from all others
upon the face of the earth, for an enlightened understanding, and
a just estimate of the blessings of society, and government: This
can be attributed to nothing, but a spirit of univerfaj freedom of
enquiryâthe general diffufion of knowledge by means of their
numberless seminaries of learning, scattered through all parts of
thecountry, and that generous concern for the public intercd,
which pervades all ranks of citizens.
Money is the nerve of warâand ln'duftry the foul of a common
wealth : In a free and jud government, the wealth of the indu
ftriousand prosperous citizen, is the wealth of the State. For
when the inhabitants of a country are under the prote&ion of
good laws, whi;n they find their confidence is judly placed in
the adminid'ration, and they realize that their pe'rfons sire p rote fl
ed, and their property secured, advances to aid the public are al
ways prompt, and liberal. Hence the rich become bankers for
the public, and the public have an exhaudlefs source to draw up
on.
The propriety and importance of attention to the coin of the
United States is obvious: Revolutions in every line produce a
lempofy lpconvemertcyâand that of an universal alteration in
the currency of a country, not one of the leaf*. The late Con
gress aware of this in the ordinance upon this fubjeft, have studi
ed that simplicity and plainncfs, which will obviate all difficulty,
provided any attention is paid to the fame by the people at large.
The general court ot Massachusetts is adjourned to January ncjct.
Both branches of the legislature of Massachusetts previous to
thejr adjournment, took the oath prescribed by law to support
the constitution of the United States.
The address to The President of the Uni.ed States having
pafl"ed both Houses of the legislature of Massachusetts, the Secre
tary of that State was directed to forward it to their Senators
in Congress, with a request that they would present the fame.
In Mr. Vining'sfpeech, publipied in our lafl, infleadof " Hercu
les rose brawling from his cradleready brawnyâand then the sense
will dc, that the government, although an infantas to age, had in Jlrength

Authentic injlance ofthe horrible barbarity oj Religious Persecution.
MARGARET Valois, Queen of Henry IV. of France, writes
in her memoirs concerning the maflacre of Paris :
" When in a found Ileep, fays lhe, I was very suddenly awak
ened by a knocking at the door, and calling out,' Navarre! Na
varre ! My nurse, thinking it was the King my husband, hasten
ed to the door; it was a gentleman named De Trajan, bleeding
very much, being wounded in two places, and with four yeoman
ofthe guard at his heels, who forctd their way after him into my
room ; he ran to my as a fan&uary, I leaped out, and he
after me, clasping m'e round the body by the bed fide. We both
cried out, one being no less frightened than the other. At length
the Captain of the guards came in, and finding me in such a con
dition, though there was more call for pity, fell a laughing, as at
foinething droll. In the Louvre, in the King's filler's chamber
even on her very bed, gentlemen were butchered, contrary to
oaths and treaties! and Niniac, who had the charattcr of one of
the worthiell men at court, laughs at the fight! He laughs in tlus
horrible juncture I Oh ! this so execrable day he couH laugh!
" Having fliifted my linen, (adds the Princess) because I was
all over bloody, and throwing a night gown over me, Iwcnt to
the appartment of Madaine de Lorraine, I was no sooner in her
anti-chamber, than a gentleman flying from the yeoman of ths
gujrd, was ltruck dead with a ha Inert close by me,"
THE NATIONAL MONITOR. âNo. XIIL
[The fubjett of the lait No. continued.]
IT mttjl be conceded on all hands that the equality of circumflances
which prevails in jome oj the United States, is more f riendly to general
liberty, than thedifparity which is apparent in others. This idea fuggefs
an obvious advantage, which will result to the Southern traveller, who
may makeÂ»' he Northern and Eajlern tour : Born with high ideas of birth,
and educated in principles ofjuperiority to the numerous herd of Jlavet
which continually surround him, the opulent planter can fcaruly conceive
oj government, obedience, and good order, among a race oj freemen : But
when he quits his extensive acres, cultivated by the hand of the de pre [fed,
and toil-worn /lave, and traverjes the highly cultivated jelds of the Eajl
ern Statesâwhen he mingles with the hardy yeomanry oj the Northâthe
indujlrious, free jpirited mechanicks, the evterprizing traders and mer
chants of the New-England StatesâWhen he objerves their variousfocial
injlrtution-s jor the promotion of harmony, mutual ajjijlance, arts, manu
failures, and literatureâthe equal opportunities enjoyed by all rank [ for
the acquisition oj knowledge, and improvement oj the human faculties,
and a variety oj other objetls which might be mentioned, and which will
always jlrihe the ingenious and attentive objerver: Ifay, an opportuni
ty to reflefl upon theje things, will have a powerful tendency to enlarge
the mind, liberalize the views, and reFiijy the afjeflions oj the Southern
traveller : he will, in all probability, return a more generousfriend to the
Tights of human nature than he jut out.
On the other hand, a variety oj prejudices will be eradicated from the
mind oj the Eajlern traveller, by exploring the regions of the South: I.e
will there find muny things worthy oj notice, ojimit-jtion and admiration:
He willjce indujlry crowned with affluence, independence, hofpita'ity,
and liberality of manners ; and notwith(landing the prevalence of doitiej
ticflavery, he will jnd the noblefl sentiments of freedom and independence
to predominateâauguring the final triumph of reajor., humanity, and
univerjal liberty ! He will behold the highly cultivated plantations e x ten
sive as the horizontal landjcape : He will extol the enterprize, the art,
and ingenuity, which are co-operating with nature to unite extensive
regions by the friendly connexion oj noble rivers, that meander through,
md frufiify the bpun'dlefs intervals : He will jee that nature here com
benjateS for intenjerjolar lays, by a joil that yields to eajier cultivation,
'han subdues the glebe which forms the jurface oj his native clime â¢ g
vill compareâhe will balanceâhe will rrfleft, that nature is wife, end
'hat providence, in the dijlribution oj its javors, is not capricious, or
