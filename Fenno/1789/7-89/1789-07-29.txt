a fhereisno natural reason why youth may not ac
â iirefuch habits as will bejl prunots their honor and
f' /// when they "re advanced in life. âBut there
"a reason in the nature of things why a child badly
clucited Jhould not make a good man."
THE reasoning, that has been applied, in
some of the preceding numbers, to li
terature, will equally hold good with refpert to
business. It is no doubt a common error in this
country that men are not suitably educated for
thcbulinefs they are to follow. Many persons,
whofc circumstances require them to purine lome
occupation or profeffion, are qualified for none.
Nothing is wore evident than that habits of
idlcnefe anddilfipation in youth are incompati
ble with a love of industry and economy in any
subsequent period. For this reason, parents
should be careful to cultivate in their children a
love of application and frugality before years of
manhood*.* It strikes the eye of even a careless
traveller through this country that estates are
feldrim preserved in the fame family for more
than two generations. By a suitable pre
caution in the mode of education, estates
mijht not only be preserved, but encreafcd
through a long line of dependents. Each fuc-,
ceilbr would improve upon the plans and exam
ples that had been left him, and parents might
anticipate the pleafurethat their children, with
out the aid of entailment, would hold fall their
patrimonial inheritance.
1 Pleasure may be indulged to a certain extent,
without becoming a ruling paflion. It may be
kept subservient to business ; and when confined
within proper reltridtions, it may have a ufeful
effect. The children of rich parents are encou
raged so far in the gratification ol their wi/hes,
that a love of idlenels and dillipation becomes ha
bitual. This indulgence is given under the idea
of acquiring fafhiouable accomplishments. Young
men arc allowed to run such a career, that they
acquire so strong an attachment to amufenicnts
and expences, as cannot be laid aside, when bu
siness and economy bccome indifpenfible. It is
easy to perceive that such an education is not
calculated to make men accumulate or even to
five property ; but to squander what is commit
ted to their hands.
In a country where the great bulk of the inha
bitants mull earn their own subsistence, it can
hardly be proper to borrow modes of education
from a people, where few are cducatedin habits
of pleasure and expence, bnt those who are ei
ther bom to fortunes, or will be provided with
elevated employments. It is of public advantage
that opulent men rtiould flatter a considerable
proportion of their income among the various
occupations and trades that fill up society. But
it can be of no utility for persons to become ha
bituated to a train of expences, which they will
sooner or later be obliged to discontinue from a
deficiency of property. The principles of edu
cation in every country ihould be specially ac
commodated to the probable circumstances of the
general run of the inhabitants.
SKETCH OF THE POLITICAL STATE OF AMERICA.
OF all the fubjefts upon which the human
judgment can be exercised there is none which so
nmch demands that its principles ihould be de
duced from facft, and be /auctioned by experience
as Commerce."
As among those causes which operated in pro
ducing the late extraordinary revolution in out
government, the want of an adequate power tc
conduct, on general principles, the commercial
interests of this country was probably the mod
efficient, we proceed to examine those grounds on
which to place our future Commerce, so as to re
alize the expectations we have formed, and pro
mote our real prosperity and welfare. It i 3 by
fomefuppofeu that Commerce ought to be free and
unreftraiiiedânot fubjetfi to any public exaiftions
or duties, and that infuoh a state it will ever find
its own "level, and be led by interest into its pro
pet channels : However benevolent the idea, this
opinion niuft have been prematurely suggested,
an d cannot be fnpported without the afi'eut of all
nationsâfor while restrictions are practised by
any,a principle of felf defence must render similar
Mpofuionj neceflary with others, to effedl apro
pcr reciprocity between them : But the necelfity
'â¢rajfing a revenue to government from this pro
ductive source, abftraOted from other confidera
forms an argument against the idea of a
commerce, altogether freeâand I conccive that
c c merchant may be retrained, and trade not
materially injuredâfor why may not a limitation
some of the natural rights of men herein be
cqoally productive of general advantage, as in a
W E D N D S-D A Y, July 29, 17^9.
variety of ocher positions, where it is sanctioned
by every principle of good government ? Perhaps
by a due attention to the subject, the danger of
licentiousness, without such regulations, is here
to be peculiarly expected. As America in the pre
sent united state of her government afl'umes an e
qual rank among the other nations of the world,
iheir critical attention will be directed to all her
public movements, while her own future fafety
and happiness may be materially effected by the
early part of her administration : It is therefore
of importance that we should nicely weigh the
ends we have in view, and ascertain the general
expediency and tendency of ourplans of internal
policy, or foreign negociation : It may rot be
here amiss to suggest a few observations relative
to the principle of difcriinination in our trade
laws, though no eflential benefit could be expect
ed from that which was proposedâyet the princi
ple is I think supported by every consideration of
found policyâis conformable to the practice of
other trading countries, and if not expressly, is
conftrucftively implied by our exifling commer
cial treatiesânor does it hold out the idea of re
venge or refentment,which ought evÂ£r to be depre
cated as of an injurious tendency when dictating ei
ther private or public measuresâbut felf-intereft,
the prevailing principle of every nation, strong
ly urges the propriety of a difcriinination ; nor
will the benevolent feelings, or kind willies of
those nations who at present bar us from every
kind of intercourse with them, but that which is
ruinous to ourselves, be found to produce that
mutual compromise which promises mutual bene
fit, while we tamely allow them every advantage
of our trade without any return : It is alked will
you risque a commercial war with Great Britain ?
will you consent to forfeit your future claim on
the credit of her merchants ? I answer, that we
will like her, ground a navigation acft on the basis
of our own interellâwe will, like her, become
our own carriersâwe will prohibit the introduc
tion of liei* manufactures, to the encouragement
of our ownâwe will prohibit from exportation
to her ports our ashes, flax-feed, and other ma
terials eflential to her manufactures : London lhall
be no longer the great entrepot of our tobacco,
rice, &c. for the consumption of half Europeâno
longer fliall theirvefTels bring us rum, taking in
return provisions and lumber, for the supply of
their Weft Indies orNova-Scotia pofleflionsâwhile
their procurators and our regilters of deeds and
mortgages would be the principal fufFerers by the
lofsof credit from their merchants : If Great-Bri
tain can import her tobacco, rice, &c. on equal
terms from the Brazils or the Indiesâcan obtain
equally good ashes, or flax-feed from the North of
Europe, or find there so general and advantage
ous a consumption of her manufacturesâif her
Weft-Indies can be as cheaply supplied with pro
visions from Irelandâlumber and flour from her
Nova-Scotia and Canada dominions, she may not
consent to open a more liberal trade , but if this,
as I presume, is not the cafe, /he will be disposed
to meet us in d commercial contract, founded on a
more perfect Veciprocity than now exists between
us. A further examination of this subject shall be
attended to, and a fubftltute for our present chan
nel of trade explored. AMERtCANUS.

Some days ago Dr. Willis had the honor of
waiting upon his Majesty ; when he entered the
apartment he found the King looking over some
papers, on which he made a Ihew of retiring.
" Stop, Doflor, fays the King âI have been only
looking over some accounts, which J have now dove
with ; but there is one account which I am afraid it
will never be in my power to fettle âmy great obliga

therefore be great.

RAIN WATER CISTERNS.
Mr. Marshal, in his Rural Economy of Yorkjbire,
makes mention of an ingenious device employed
by the inhabitants of the vale of Pickering, for
making rain-water answer thepurpofesof domes
tic economy, viz. by mak'ng deep cijlerns under
ground. But this, we beg leave to observe, is not
peculiar to this diftritf, or to England. In Tuf.
cany, near Sienna, where all the spring-water has
an unwholesome impregnation, it is the practice
of all families to have these under ground cisterns,
where they preserve the rain water. We have
been informed by an ingenious gentleman wh 1
resides in this country that the root of every house
v catches as much rain water as all the family wants,
that they have two cisterns, one to catch the fii ft
shower, which washes the roof clean, and when
this is done, they turn the water into a second
cistern, where the purest water for drinking, &c.
is preserved. This gentleman further informed
us, that their cisterns were from 20 to 30 feet be
low the furface, and that the water in them was
more pure, transparent, and fpirity, than the belt
fpiing-water he ever tailed. To many of our
readers, this information may be acceptable.

His Most CHRISTIAN MAJESTY'S SPEECH
to the States-General.
" Verfaiiles, April 27, 1789.
" THE DAY, Gentlemen, for which my heart
waited with emotion is at last arrived, and 1 fee
nyfelf surrounded by the Representatives of ana-
Lion, over which I elteem it a glory to reign. A
long interval has elapsed since an ailembly of the
itaies General has been held ; and although con
vocations of this kind seemed in some measure to
have fallen into disuse, I did not hesitate to re
eltablifh a custom, which may impart additional
vigour, and open new sources of happiness to the
kingdom.
" The national debt, which was immense at
my accession to the throne, has increased under
my reign : an expenlive, but honorable war has
been the cause of it ; and an augmentation of im
ports was the natural confeqnence. A general
alarm, with an ardent wish for innovations, pervad
ed the public mind, and an union of wife and mo
derate councils mull avert the threatened danger.
It is with confidence, gentlemen, I have convened
you ; and I fee with pleasure that this confidence
is juftified by the disposition the two firft orders
nave shewn, in renouncing their pecuniary exemp
tions. The hopes I have conceived of feeing all
. be Orders united in sentiment, and co-operating
with me to the general welfare of the State, will
not be disappointed. I have ordered some consi
derable retrenchments of expense, and shall pe
ruse with solicitous attention every fuggeltion that
shall be presented to me on that fubjc.fi : But
notwithflanding the resources -which the Irrtleji eco
nomy can introduce, I am afraid, gentlemen, I shall
not be able to relieve my fubjefls as fpeedil* as 1 could
v,ijh ; the real situation of the finances fill belaid
before you, gentlemen ; and when yott have ex
amined them, 1 am certain that you will propose
the molt efficacious means of establishing perma
nent order in them, and restoring the public cre
dit. 1 his grand and salutary work, which will
insure happiness to the whole kingdom within,
and promote its consequence abroad, will be the
firft objecft of ourferious attention. The people's
minds are in a state of perturbation, but an atiem
bly of the Representatives will only listen to the
voice of wisdom. You must be sensible, gentle
men, that on several recent occasions, prudence
has not been ftriftly adhered to ; but the predo
minant spirit of your deliberations will corres
pond with the true sentiments of a generous na
tion, the character of which has always been a
firm attachment to her Monarchs ; *nd I, 011 my
part, will banish every otheh refledion. lam con
scious of, and fatisfied with, the authority and
power which a just and upright King will be ever
able to maintain over an enlightened and a loyal
people. To promote their happiness will, as it
ought to do, form the principal felicity of my life,
and they have a right to expert the *arineft zeal,
the mort tender interefl for the public weal, and
whatever, in Ihort, may be hoped for from a So
vereign, who feels himfelf the firft and truest
friend of his lubjects, and who considers his af
recftion for them as his greateil glory.
" May unanimity, gentlemen, reign in thisAf
fembly and this epoch become memorable for
laying the foundation of the happiness and prof
pei ity of the kingdom ! It is what my heart longs
to fee, and the molt ardent of all my wishes it
is the reward I am entitled ro,forthe uprightness

In the begining of the late revolution we were
repeatedly told, that our vacant lands would ae

wifely about to realize that declara ion by open

prevent our entailing a heavy and ruinous iÂ»' er

NEIV-YORK, JULY 29, 1789.
The President of the United States was so
well as to receive visits of compliment from many
official characters and citizens yesterday ; but
we learn, that, until his strength shall be more
fully restored, he proposes to receive them only
once a week, and that on I'uefiUys.
Mrs. Washington, we are informed, will
be at home every Friday, at eight o'clock, P. M.
co fee company.
On Saturday last the Molt Hon. Rufus King,
and on Monday the Molt Hon. Philip Schuy
ler, took their feats in the Congress of the Uni
ted States, as Senators from the <diltri<st of New-
York.
We hear, that the Supreme Executive of the
United States, in conf'equence of the resignation
of Chnrles Tliompfon, Esq. has committed the
records and papers of rhe late Congress, and the
Great Seal of the United btates, to the cultody
ofRoGER Alden, Esq. till further orders.
Extratt t>J a letter fromConneÃicut, July, 1789.
" You inform me that the probable plan ot ap
pointments will beâfirft, to continue those alrea
dy in otfice in the several States, who have given
indubitable proof of fidelity and capacity, except
ing in instances where superior political, and of
ficial abilities may point them out, as proper fub
jecfts of promotion âfccondly, that those charac
ters of the late American army, who may be
qualified, who merit much, but from the unfa
vorable circumstances ot the country, have never
been suitably rewarded,will next be noticedâand
thirdly, that persons who in civil life have evin
ced a firm attachment to the cause of their coun
try in all the different views in which it has been
placed ; more especially the advocates and friends
of the new constitution, whose characT;eis and
qualifications entitle them to patronage, will also
receive attention. .
" This arrangement meets my approbation en
tirely ; but at the fame time great caution is re
quisite to avoid efl'ential mistakes âin the firft
place, it is not difficult for persons in office who
are unworthy of, and incompetent to the places
they hold, to procure factitious testimonials in
their favor.
" Itmuft be granted, also, that many persons
mistake their own talentsâand men who have
done well in one situation, may be totally unqua
lified for others : There is a fort of claim which
military characters possess, that may unduly bias
the judgment âand it is possible, that some candi
dates for office cannot with propriety, iwholly im
pute their present deprefled circumstances to the
deficiencies of their country.
" The third description affords the greateit
range for the felecftion of competent public offi
cersâand from this, all other considerations be
incr equal, no doubt a preference will be given
to those who have supported the Conlhtution,
ill appointments which have for their object the
promotion of the public interest, upon the prin
ciples of that Constitution."
Every plealing anticipation is entertained with
refpecft to the nominations to office that are im
mediately to be made.â The hackneyed prove; b,
that " kiffinggoes by favor," will be found to
tally inapplicable on'tliis occasion ; an inflexible
independency of determination having always
distinguished the appointments of the late Com*
mander in Chief of the American armyâthere is
every reason to expeift that real abilities and clefert
will be the only influencing confederations*
A correfponclent observes, that however plausi
ble the idea, in an economical view, of prevelit
ingthe encreafe of offices by jumbling a great va
riety of heterogeneous business in one department,
maybe, yet it will be found that luch arrange
ments mult be made, to prevent confufion, as will
in the ifl'ue be as expenlive as openly establishing
so many diftindl offices.
A correspondent observes upon the fubjeA 01
Titles, that a total renunciation of them involves
an idea, that is levelled not only at the exifter.ee
of government, but of all society whatever.âSo
ciety supposes orderâorder,grades and dijlinfl ions
âMankind haveneveryetdevifed any other mode
of designating tliefe diftincftions than by titles.
To suppose therefore that they are unneceflary,
is to suppose that human nature poflefles an in
tuitive faculty of discerning merit,& of ascertain
ing its various degrees, so as never to fail oi .pon
taneoufly paying it dae refpetfl, without any ex
ternal indication whatever âthe absurdity of this
is too grofsfor reflection.

WEALTH EXAMINED.
[Continued J rom our
IT is pretended by some, that a sovereignty
in a Tingle ail'eivibly, annually eletfted, is theonly
one in which there is any responsibility for the
exercise of power. In the mixed government we
contend for, theminifters, atleaft for the execu
tive power, are responsible for every instance of
the exercise of it ; and if they difpo'fe of a single
commiifion by corruption, they are responsible to
a houfeof representatives, who may, by impeach
ment, make them responsible before a senate,
where they may be accused, tried, condemned,
and puriifhed, by independent judges. But in
a single sovereign aflembly, each member, at the
end of his year, is only responsible to his constitu
ents ; and the majority of members who have
been of one party, and carried all before them,
are to be responsible only to their condiments,
not to the conftituenrs of the minority who have
been overborne, injured, and plundered. And
who are these constituents to whom the majority
are accountable ? Those very persons, to gratify
whom they have prostituted the honours, rewards,
wealth, and jullice of the state. These, instead
of punifhirig will applaud ; instead of dif'carding,
will re-eledl, with still greater eclat,and a more
numerous majority ; for the losing cause will be
deferred by numbers : and this will be done in
hopes of having Itill more injuflice done, Itill
more honours and profits divided among theni
felves, to the exclusion and mortification of the
minority. It is then astonishing that such a fun
pie government should be preferred to a mixed
one, by any raijnal creature, on the score of re
sponsibility. There is, in short, no pollible way
of defending the minority, in such a government,
from the tyranny of the majority, but by giving
the former a negative on the latter, the molt ab"
surd institution that ever took place among men.
As the major may bear all polfible relations of
proportion to the minor part, it may be fifty-one
agairift forty-nine in an allembly of an hundred,
or it may be ninety-nine against one only : it be
comes therefore neceflary to give the negative to
the minority, in all cases, though it be ever so
small. Every member must poflefs it, or he can
never be secure that himfelf and his constituents
ihall not be facrificcd by all the reft. This is the
true ground and original of the liberum veto in
Poland ; but the consequence has been ruin to
that noble but ill-constituted republic. One fool,
or one knave, one member of the diet, which is
a single sovereign aflembly, bribed by an intrigu
ing ambaflador of some foreign power, has pre
vented ineafures the most eflential to the defence,
fafety, and existence of the nation. Hence hu
miliations and partitions ! This also is the rea
son on which is founded the law of the United
Netherlands, that all the seven provinces must be
unanimous in the aflembly of the States General ;
and all the cities and other voting bodies in the
aflemblies of the separate states. Having 110 fuf
ficient checks in their uncouth constitution, nor
any mediating power poflefled of the whole exe
cutive, they have been driven to demand unani
mity instead of a balance : and this must be d >ne
in every government of a single aflembly, or the
majority will instantly oppress the minority.
But what kind of government would that be in
the United States of America, or anyone of them,
that fliould require unanimity, or allow of the li
berum veto ? It is fufficieiit to ask the queltion,
for every man will answer it alike.
FINANCIAL MEMENTO^
From the FEDERAL GAZETTE.
I HAVE had my attention seriously engaged
by the publication of the Estimate of the Supplies
requisite for the United States in the year 1 7SO.
011 investigating this report of a committee, it
appears that the annual demands 011 the Union
for the civil lift expenditures,the instalments due
011 foreign loans, and the interest on the foreign
and domestic debt, amount to 3,207,096 21-90
Deduct instalments a'pd pre
mium on the loan 490,962 8} 90
2,716,133 24-90
which is the clear amount of the annual contri
butions for the support of government âfor the
payment of the instalments is a liquidation of
so much of the capital of the foreign debt, which
by being exiinguifhed, will require a proportion
ally less sum to be raised in subsequent years for
interest;
As for the various arrearages,which the report
takes notice of, and which form the balance of
the sum total, they are not to be considered as an
annual demand, but will probably be consolidat
ed with the capital of the debt* and the interest
thereon be alone required.
So far from room for despondency in the minds
of the good people of these States, by such a re
presentation of their affairs, it exhibits the most
flattering and favorable -profpedts. The annual
requisitions will not amount to a dollar per head,
Â£ilimatingthe population .of the .Union at three
millions : A fir.all demand, in exchange for such
invaluable bleltings as peace, liberty and inde
pendence ; and which mult be lightly felt in a
ountry that can afford to pay three {hillings per
day lor a common laborer.
It is not probably a fourth of the contributions
that we Ihould have been compelled to turnilh
towards our proportion of the national debt ot
Great Britain, if we s .ad remained under the
domination of that haughty and exacting nation.
But letus enquire what is the relative iituation
of other countries, with reipeCt to quantum of
public contributions.
Great Britain under the operation of a govern
ment, that it mull be confelled pays pointed at
tention to her agricultural, commercial and ma.
nufaifturing pursuits, flourilhes, notwithllanding
an accumulation of public debt, that demands
an annual supply of lixteen millions sterling, to
fatisfy its interelt,and support her other expences.
But the people are so little opprelled by these
demands, that tkey are enabled, with ease, to
raifc by taxation a fufticient sum to constitute a
linking fund,which in the course of the lalt year
extingui/hed two millions of the capital of the
national debt.
Calculating on eight milions of inhabitants
in Great Britain, there will be apportioned to
each individual, as an annual contribution, forty
Ih'llings llerling, which is betwixt eight and
nine dollars per head.âWhat a flattering conli
deration for the citizens of the United States,
arises out of the comparative iituation of the
two countries !âBut what renders the reflection
ltill more pleasing, is, that Great Britain may
be deemed Itationary, if not declining, in her
population, and consequent resources. But the
United States present an unbounded field for pro
grellive population ; and the encrcafe of inhabi
tants will ease the burthen of the debt, by addi
tional numbers participating in the support ofits
weight.
This augmentation does not only arise from
natural increase in a country firuated like Ameri
ca, where the means of fubliftence aie so easily
to be procuredâbut likewise from the rapid emi
gration that will neceilarily take place, from the
fupeiior encouragement that a government, so
well conllituted to favor civil and religious liber
ty, and protect the rights of property, will offer.
Such emigrations are usually, accompanied with
conliderable acquisitions of property, which add
to the general Itock of the community.
When the United States of America have ar
ranged their financial fj Item, and made ample
provision for their exilling claims, the progrellivc
increase of the taxes, arising from various cau
ses, joined to the sales of the western teritory,
will form a conliderable surplus, that may be
applied to the gradual and speedy extinction of
the capital of the public debt.
The beneficial cffetfts of the funding system,
when founded on proper principles, will be felt
through all clafles of the communityâas it will
throw into circulation the capital of the domellic
debt, increase thereby the general ltock of the
country, and facilitate the various purposes of
alienation.
It a comparative view was formed of the pub
lic debts of France, Spain, or Holland, the Uni
ted States would find, that it would induce are
fult much more favorable than even that with
Great Britain.
This communication of Congress c.'.n therefore
give no cause of exultation to the enemies of the
government. Foreign nations inuft refpeifi the
resources of a country, abounding in such pow
erful means, and so unfettered by its present en
gagements. A FRIEND to the UNION.

of my readinefsto advifc every' rneafure calculated to compose
' party divilions, and to abate any animofitv that may be excited
' by mere difference of opinion,' I take the liberty of referring
y u to the fcntiments communicated by ine, to the two Houfesot
Congress. On this occalion, lam ltkewife happy in being able to
add the ftroogeft alfurances, that I entertain a well grounded ex
pectation that nothing will be wanting on the part of the different
branches ol the general government to render the union asperietf,
and more late than ever it has bfeo.
A difference of opinion ou points is not to be imputed
to freemen as a fault; lince it is to be prefumcd that they are all
afiuated by an equally laudable and sacred regard for the liberties
ol then country. II the mind is so formed in different perfonsas
to consider the lame object to be somewhat different in its nature
and consequences, as it happeni to be placed in different points oj
view, and if the oldelt, the ablcft, and the mod virtuous flatefmea
have olten differed in judgment as to the best forms of govern
ment*âwe ought, indeed, rather to reioicethat so much has been
cff'lttd, than to icgret that more could not all at once bcac.om.

Giatified by the favorable fentimerits which are evinced in your
addrefi to me, und impressed with an idea that the citizens of your
State are sincerely attached to the interest, the prosperity, and the
glory ol America, I molt carneitly implore the divine benedidioa
and guidance"in the councils which are Ihortlyto be taken by their
delegates on a fubjett of the most momentous consequence, I
mean the political relation which is to subsist herealter, between
the State of North-Carolina, and the States now in union under
tJic new general government.

A SEW METHOD Of MAKING POTASH.
PUT your ashes into your fatts about four

when begining to boil, put in about the bignefe
of an hen's egg of hog's fat every day when boil
ing, into each kettle, and skim your kettles once
a day, which will take of all the fat ; and when
drying clown your falts,throw in a piece of allum,
one ounce, and take great notice about yourfalts
fettling-Â»-when they once fettle, it will not be but
a few minutes before there will be a fmallcrufton
