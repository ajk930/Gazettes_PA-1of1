TTis to beexpeflcd that the partiality of parents will induce
I them to suppose, their children can make improvements
â¢ a âv art or profeflion whatever. To gratify these tond preju

f" B thenÂ° are called hopeless blockheads and conftan ly liable to
Â°' n ,foment and reproachâThat special bias towards knowledge,
which with proper care, might be discovered, is apt to lie dor
mant and never have an opportunity to improve or apply ltfelf.
The objection against trying to introduce a reformation,is found
ed in a supposed impracticability. It is urged that no scrutiny
of talents can be made, with such exaftnefs, as to authorize the
attempt- The different capacities and inclinations of youth arc not
to be fu'clearly ascertained as to make it eligible to breakthrough
clUblilhcd rales of study. In answer to these objections, it may
be observed, that if upon experiment no method can be devised
for determining the special aptitude of each particular genius, the
â¢refi ut claflical regulations will of course be continued. I pro
ceed upon the principle that it is prafticablc to discover peculiar
propcnfities; and in those cases, where no such discovery can be
made, ihe principle is not to be applied. It follows thatan alter
ation cannot force itfclf where it is not requifit'c. The reformation
would be attempted only on those students who do not, at any
late, acquire material advantages, under the prcft nt modes of e
ducation. If they can derive any benefit from a different manner
of tuition, and derive none from the prelent regulations, there will
fcefomethinggained without hazardingthe loss of any thing.
Tholewhohave been in any degree conversant with universities
need not be told, how great a proportion of students pass away
their academical years in indoknee and disgust. To what can
this be owing ? Some pretend that the natural aversion or inca
pacity of youth, is the cause of their reluctance against study, and
thatit docs not proceed fiom injudicious treatment. Thispretence
is not wholly to be regarded. I have granted that some students
ami learn, merely for want of capacity; but I have averted that
others will not learn, because they are not properly managed.
The objefl of the reformation I propose is to discriminate charac
ters. Those who have not g-nius for anv thing can be distinguish
ed from those who have genius forJometi.ing; and those who have
id aptitude of mind to learn every thing can be delignated from
both the others. By suitable managemtnt it may be determined,
how far the defefl is to be ascribed io nature, and how tar to bad
institutions, that so finall a propoition of students gain any sub
stantial advantages from a public educatioo.
In convetfation with a hitnd upon this ful-jeft he did not coin
cide with my opinion, but rather supposed the difficulty proceed
ed from a want of proper inftru&ors. He imagined, that the
idlenefsand disgust obit red among students were occasioned
more by the austere, unaccommodating behaviour of the profef
fors and tutors, than by any improper alignment of studies. This
point (hall come next under consideration.
CHARALTER OF THE MODERN HIGHLANDERS.
[from Knox's works.]
THE Highlanders have in all riges been re
nowned for bravery and fidelity in the cause
which they espoused ; strongly attached to their
families, their chieftains and country, for whom
they braved all dangers, and endured every kind
of hardfliip. At present, that barbarous ferocity,
which was the offspring of feudal institutions, is
completely extinguished ; while their native val
our, and military character remain unimpaired.
They are intelligent, hospitable, religious, inof
fenfive in their manners, fubmiifive to superiors,
temperate, frugal, grateful, obliging, honest and
faithful. A man nlay travel in perfetft security
from one extremity of the Highlands to t he other,
without taking any precaution whatever in de
fence of his pel foil or property. Wherever he
goes, he meets with a civility, modesty and liof
pitality, which would do honor to the most polilh
ed nations ; wherever he reposes any confidence,
he discovers an attachment and disinterested readi
ness to oblige, which more opulent fubjeifts can
scarcely conceive an idea of. These qualities are
the universal theme of travellers of whatever
nation, who have lately visited the Highlands of
Scotland.

Our friends may come to want, and it is a de

we arefeldom obliged to borrow, which is a hu

ILLIBERAL POLITICAL CONDUCT OF BRI

ALTHOUGH we cannot be insensible of the
prejudices of a part of the English nation againfl
the people of the United States of America ; yet
we oujjfht in all our conduct to shew such magna
nimity asfhall convince them, that we are neither
ignorant of their unreasonableness, or unmind

nation that we are capable ofbeing injured, with
out retaining resentment. Lei us charitably im

inhabitants from migrating to America, the falfe
representations -which they are conltantly giving,
in their NewsPapers, of the slate of this country.
It is true, their representations have, in many in
stances, been made up of such extravagant and
incredible falfhoods, as have operated in the na
ture of an antidote againfl the poison, which they
were designed to have infufed into the minds of
the Europeans. Notwithftaiuling this lias not al
ways been the cafe ; yet we ought to remember
that truth is mighty, and will at last prevail.â
Let the real circumstances of the United Statep
of America, in the year 1780, be known to the
â¢world ; and then let the world determine, whether
it is for the Politicians and Critics of the Island of
Britain, sarcastically to deplore our miseries, im
pudently to contradiifl the taifts which ai e eltab

to ridicule our future profpe<fts !
The preceding observations are made partly
for the purpose of introducing the following
beautiful lines, which were written before the

called the Conquejl of Canaan ; as well as partly

BIOGRAPHICAL,
ON the 17th of last January died at Grand
Cairo, in Egypt, Mr. JOHN LEDYARD, a na
tive of the State of Connecticut. He served un
der Capt. Cook, in the last voyage which that
able navigator performed, and was one of the
witnefles to his tragical fate on the iflandof Owy
hee ; an account of which, with the material
occurrences of the voyage, he published in Ame
rica, before that great and splendid relation of
it appeared in England, 111 which honorable men
tion is made of Mr. Ledyard. He had a most in
satiable defite to visit unknown countiies, and
offered his services to the Empress of R.uSfia,
through her Amballador at Paris, to explore the
continent of America, and to attempt to pass from
the north weft coast to the northern parts of the
United States, or the Atlantic. Being disap
pointed in these views, he undertook the journey,
with the afliftance of a few friends, and found
his way from Paris to Petersburg, and front thence
to Kaniptfchatka, were, by order of the Entprefs,
he was put, without any previous notice, into a
fledge drawn by dogs, and after returning to the
Southward, was sent out of her Majesty's domi
nions. Being thus again disappointed, he went
0 London, and proposed to the Royal African
Company to make a journey through Africa, and
to examine the unknown parts of that quarter of
the globe.âHe accordingly arrived at Grand Cai
ro, under the auspices of this Company; and
thinking himfelf 011 the moment of pointing his
way towards Abylfinia, from whence he expected
to have continued his rout to the Cape of Good
1 Tope : he made all his arrangements for this long
journey, and engaged the proteifiion of a cara
van, which was to set out in a few days to
wards the southward. Here, however, he finish
ed his career, and is gone to " that undiscovered
country, from whose bourn notraveller returns."
Mr. Ledyard was strong and atftive, bold as a li
on, and gentle as he was bold. By his intrepi
dity, pcrfeverance and patience under hard
ships, he seemed calculated to execute such en
terprizes as he was always in pursuit of; and the
miscarriage of his project for exploring either
America or Africa mult be felt as a very general
and public loss.FOR THE GAZETTE OF THE UNITED STATES.

SKETCH OF PROCEEDINGS OF CONGRESS.
In the HOUSE of REPRESENTATIVES of the
UNITED STATES.
\Debate on the proportion to make a di/crirnination be
tween the pay of the Seriate and House of Rcpre
fentatives.
THURSDAY, JULY I 6, 1789.
MR. JACKSON opposed this discrimination
He observedâWe have all alike abandoned our
paiticular pursuits in life, and are all equally en
gage-'. in the service of our countryâand I can
fee 110 realon for making any difference : Can a
Senator eat moreâor does he drink better than a
Representative I I presume notâtheir expences
are equal : There is but one reason that can be
alfigned tor this diltindtion, and that is, the Senate
may fit longer than the House; but as it must be
considered that they will receive pay according
ly, this reason falls to the ground. Thebulinefs
of both houf'es is the lame, and the pay oujjht to
be alike.
Mr. Lef. observed, that the Constitution had
made a difference, and that we ought to do it :
There is a degree of refinement in the mode of
electing Senators :âThey are our belt menâand
I think that every encouragement ought to be
given to draw forth the firft abilities :âThe dif
ference of two or three dollars is but a trifling
diftindlion to our venerable sages : At present
there may be young men in the Senate ; but the
time will come when our molt honorable, grey
headed fires, the experienced and wife men of our
land will fill thofc feats : Old men are with diffi
culty brought into public lifeâevery inducement
should therefore be held outâthe honor and dig
nity of our government is inseparably connected
with supporting, in aproper manner, this impor
tant branch of our legislature ; The Constitution
â¢warrants a diftindtion : It is founded on the best
expe;ieiiceâl therefore give my hearty aflent to
the proposal for a discrimination.
Mr. White : Sir, I am opposed to a discrimi
nation : I cannot fee the difference in the Consti
tution which the gentlemen refers to : There
was an artificial and political diftindlion establish
ed between the Senators and the people in foine
of the ancient Commonwealths : Phis was the
cafe at Rome in particular : The Senators were
there coniidered as pofle fling a portion of divinity;
and the reft of the people were not fuffered to mix
with them.âls it to be supposed that becaufeour
Senators have the fame name they are of afuper
ior order to their fellow men ! Whatever may
be the lemiment here, in their refpeclive States
there is no difference in the genera) estimation
between a Senator and a lieprelentativeâand why
any discrimination iliould be made in their reipec
tive allowances 1 cannot conceive.
This diftimftion will operate against the inde
pendence of the members of this liouleâand may
in some future day enable the Senate to carry
points, by being able to prolong the feflions when
it may be greatly to the inconvenience of the
lioufe.
Mr. Madison was in favor of the discrimina
tion : He said it was evidently contemplated by
the Constitution to hold out iome distinCtion in
favour of the Senate, as an inducement for men
ot ltaid and fixed principles, whom habits of re
tirement might render averse from the active
scenes of public life, to devote the experience ot
years and the acquilitions of lludy to the service
of their countryâand except fomerhing of this
kind is done, we may find it difficult to obtain pro
per characters for the Sfenate, as men of enter
prise and genius will naturally prefer a feat in
the house which will be considered as a morecon
fpicuous situation.
Mr. Vinimg was opposed to the motion for
discrimination : He observed that wealthy men
would in all probabilit/ be chosen Senators, and
that the reprelentatives would not in general be
of that classâthe discrimination ought therefore
if any was made, to be in favor of the latter:
This (said he) is a fubje<ft on which we can feel,
but which it is difficult to discuss. lam against
the reducftion of the sum mentioned in the re
port, as I think that sum quite infufficient: Six
dollars Sir, is not equal to the expence per day
at which many gentlemen live when at home :
We surely do not intend to make the public ser
vice unpleasant, by rendering the situation of
gentlemen less eligible.âAs to discrimination,
the constitution has fufficiently pointed out the
proper diftindion : Mr. Vining added many
more observations and concluded, by faying ]
have exprefled myfelf fully up >n this occasion :
1 am not afraid that my sentiments ffiould be
known to my constituents, because 1 think theirs
are agreeable to my own.
Mr. Seney : I am sorry Sir, that the question
of discrimination has been brought before the
House: What real'oii can be alligned for making
this diftindion ? Are the services of the Senate
greater than those of the Reprelentatives ? 1 think
not. âGentlemen have brought forward the con
stitution upon this occasion ; but I conceive it is
opposed to the principle they mean to advocate.
The independence of the several branches is to
be ftritftly preserved, this will destroy that inde
pendence : If we eftabliih a discrimination in fa
vor of the Senate, will it not naturally tend to
create a sense of inferiority in the minds of the
Ileprefentatives ? and the time may come, when
they may find it for their interelt to be entirely
subservient to the views of the Senate: Sir, 1 feel
lo sensibly the impropriety and unconftitution
ality of this measure, that if 1 had the smallest
idea that it would comport with the sentiments
of a majority of the members of this House, I
ffiould call for the ayes and noes upon the ques
tionâbut as I do notconteive tliatto be the cafe,
I ffiall for the present wave the proposition.
Mr. Sedgwick observed that whenever he
had a motion to make in the House, he always
endeavoured to fatisfy himfelf of the reafonable
nei's and propriety of the proposition it contain
ed : When he had determined is was proper, the
mode of decision that lhould be adopted, he con
sidered as not of very material conlequenceâbut
in determining the present question, he hoped
the ayes and noes would not be called. There
is a principle in human nature, which revolts
from the idea of inferiorityâhence when a pro
position is made which has for its object the cfta
bliffimentof a luperiority, in whatever form you
please, that principle is alarmed, and excited to
oppositionâbut in difcufling such a question as
the present we ought to divest ourselves of every
partiality and prejudice which may bias our judo-,
ments to a decision that will not bear the test of
reason and experience.âThe constitution has 1
conceive plainly pointed out the precedence of
the Senate: rnere are grades in lociety which
are neceflary to their very existence. i his is a
fell* evident âit is recognized by eve
ry civilized nation : It is recognized by the House
in the report before us : Why else have we made
a difference between the President andVice-Pi e
fident ? Is it not on account of his superior ftati
-011, and weight of dignityâand between the
Vice-President and the Senate ? This diftindtion
is also eftabliffied in the difference of the terms
for which the Senate and the House of Ilepre
fentatives is chosen : The tune for which the Se
nate is chosen, points out the propriety of a dif
ference in the pay they ought to receive : The
acfmimftration of the government will require
that they ffiould more completely abftraift them
selves from petfonal pursuits : Their attention
will be alrnolt wholly absorbed by an attention
to public duties : They fliouiu therefore have-'
adequaie and independent allowance : They \ "j!
generally be of an age that will preclude
tiom all idea of ever engaging in cheir feUr-l
profeiiions after once having engaged in thÂ» lb?
vice of their country : Their age, their wisdom
and experience, all warrant this Uilcriinination
Mr. StDGwiCK added many more obfervatiom
to (hew the policy and constitutionality of the
discrimination, and concluded by faying, thr
lie thought the real dignity of the House lb %
from being diminilhed by adopting the propositi
on, that he conceived it Was cflentially counter
ed with it.
Mr. (ackson in reply to the enquiry of M r
Sedgwick,âWhy have we made a difference
between the Prelident and Vice-Prelident? ob
served, That the President will be employed the
whole of his time : The Vice-President may re
tire to his farm whenever he pleases. Reference
is had to the wisdom of the Senateâbut how is
this superior wisdom made to appear ? If a dif
tinc r tioli is to be made 011 this account, it follows
that a difference ihould be made between the ie
veral members of this House and alio between
those of the Senate.âWe cannot be too cautious
how we eftabliih an undue pre-eminence and
give an intluence and importance to one branch
of the legillature over the other: All govern
ments tend to despotism asnaturally as rivers run
into the sea.âDespotism carries its points giadu
ally by flow and imperceptible steps: Despotic
power is never eflablifhed all at once : We ihall
ere we are aware get beyond the gulph, and then
wonder how we got there : The Cervices of the
Senate are not more arduous thanouis; then
proper business is legislation, and I never will
consent to any discrimination : Had I any idea
that the queltion would be determined in favor
of discrimination, I fliould be for calling the aytt
and noes, and ihould it be so determined, 1 (hall
chufe to enter my negative againlt it.
Mr. Page made a number of obfervations,which
as he spoke low were not diflintftly heard: thus
much we collected, that he was in favor of the
discrimination: He said, that in his opinion,
the Senate ought to have permanent salaries, that
they might be placed in an eligible and indepen
dent situation.
The proposition for a discrimination as menti
oned in our lall was however negatived.]

AGRICULTURAL.
WILMINGTON, JULY 18.
It may be of service to our readers, to be in
formed of the following facfts relative to far
luing.
When I leafed ProfpertHill estate, I found two
thirds of the land sown with wheat, rye and bar
ley, l'othat there was only left forpaflure about
21 acres, wiji some meadow ground, and 14 acres
which was miserably poor, iandy and gravelly.
These 14 acres I planted with Indian corn, and
manured it in every hill, so far as the manure
would go (there being bit little on the farm)
from which I received a tolerable cropâl worked
the ground well, giving it 4 ploughings and 2
harrow ings, with the last I put my wheat in the
groundâthe following season my wheat was only
knee High. I reaped it as near the ground as
poflible, and immediately ploughed in the stub
ble, and late in September 1 sowed it with rye,
which, at the following harvest, was generally
five feet high, and in some places much higher,
and from which I threshed about 10 bushels to
the acre. T his rye Hubble I ploughed in like
wise, and sowed the ground with wheat. Un
der this culture this ground has been managed
for fix fuccellive years, without any manure ex
cept about ten common cart loads ; and I now have
the pleasure of feeing as fine a crop of red bear
ded wheat on it as the neighbourhood can pro
duce ; I think I shall not reap less than 12 or 15
bulhels from the acre, b'rom this and many other
experiments I have made, I am well convinced of
the utility of a fucceflion of crops."
" 111 turning over an old magazine for Jan.
1760, page 7, I find the following observation,
which 1 think should be particularly attended to
by the gentlemen of this country. " I can not
help joining with the author of the new system
of agriculture, in his severe cenfureofour coun
try gentlemen.
" It is to me," fays he, " a surprising proof
of our gentlemen's inaptitude to this noble art
(agriculture) to fee so many hundred tlioufand
acres pestered, and corrupted by common dung,
the bowels of which very land is loaded with in
exhaustible quantities of real and wholesome phy
sic for its own diseases.
" Dung is not only prejudicial tft foine foils,
but inferior to the worst of any composts upon
any. One would wonder to fee how people put
themselves to extraordinary charges, and the in
conveniency of fending to great diflances for horse
dung, to manure tliofe very lands which ntver
fail of being verged or bottomed by a substance
of one kind or other, by far more proper for the
end they aim at; and therefore I lay it down as
a rule, almost without exception, that every foil,
of what nature, situation or condition soever,
abounds with natural and fufficient helps for its
own peculiar imperfections."

In 1772, the county of EfTex contained 11,457
males above 16 years of age ; in 1784, only 11,023 :
So that in a period of 12 years, there was a de
crease in this county, of 434 rateable polls.
The county of Lincoln, in the fame period, en
creatd its rateable polls from 1354 to 5071.
NEW-YORK, JULY 22, 1789.
The fcttlemcnt of the Western territory isconfidered bymanv
persons as an event inauspicious to the interest ot those States situa
ted upon the Atlantic. Time was when the migration of the in
habitants from the sea ports, only 40 or 50 miles into the country,
was confide red as pregnant with fatal confcquencestofuch fea-porrs:
but now those interior lettlements are found neceflary to the exig
ence of the trade and manufa&urcs of our populous maritime towns.
âIn proportion as we advance to empire our ideas will expand,
and the period is fact approaching when those extensive regions
will prove a boundless source of wealth to the Unionâthey will
extend the domeflic and internal trade of the Union in such man
ner as will convince us of our ability to support the Independence
of the United States, beyond any other cireumftancc to be,named.
Extral7 of a letter ftom Maffachuftts, dated July 13.
" With refpe& to :he mode of tranfmiting messages, bl!I*â
-c. from either house, I cannot fay that it plea'es /Tie : Indepen
dent of its being improper that the Secretary or Clerk should he
absent from their refpettive stations, they are not members, and
this being a neceifary step in the progress of a legiflaiive ast, it
.hould most certainly be perform d by a member or members.
" I observe by the papers that The President of the United
States has returned the Impoft-Btllto the Houfc after receiving his
pprobation, by his Sec rerAr y. It was expected that this part
of Legillation would have been marked with some cha
ra&eriftic feature: More particularly would there not be Meat
propiiety in the PRESIDENT'S going to the FEDERAL HALL,
a id there, in the presence of both Houses of the Legislature give
his aflent, publicly, to the bills ? It appears to me that this would
be properâwould impress upon the public m nd an idea of the
importance and solemnity of the lawsâand hold up the several
branches of the Government to the view of the p?op!e, in a conspi
cuous and dignified pomt of light: It has been supposed that the
President's late indisposition prevented the adoption of this plan.
Someperfons may perhaps objett to this, for however astonishing
the it seems to be a point with many to prevent the people
from thinking too favorably or refpe&fillly of the government, or
the administration."
The fubje& of amendments is at length put in proper trainâhad
the Constitution been launched upon the waves of speculation and
indefinite theories, we might well have been alarmed for itsfafety
and future fate, among the (hallows and whirlpools which are
found in those seas.
It has been said that the Constitution of the United States is as
well established at the present mordent as if it had been in opera
tion a century : Ifthis is the cafe, and it wiil be difficult to prove
the contrary, it is very problematical whether attempts to ft rength
en its foundation will not tend rather to weaken than confirm it.
A correspondent observes that the confufion, and consequent
distress occasioned by the sudden stoppage to the circulation of
rhe copper coin, are fubjefts that call for the immediate attention
of authority: The poorer class of citizens are peculiarly affe&ed
by this circumstance, many of whom had their little all inverted
in this most uncertain of all human poffefllons, a flu&uating
medium: Manv of the retail {hops are shut : The cries are
suspended in the streets, and it is with difficulty the poor can
purchase bread of the bakers, or vegetables in the market : This
evil has been long forefeen, and yet the base trumpery calhd cop
pers (greatly inferior to Woods' infamous brass money)has been
pouring in upon us like a flood for many months past : Many of
the merchants and shop keepers, it \s said, have large films by
them of this coin, by which they will be great fufferers.
We are informed that on Saturday last, Mr. Harrough laid
the models of his new-invented machines before the President
of the United States, who, after a critical examination, approved
of them much;and was pleased to fay, that he hoped the public
would reward the inventor in a manner adequate to the great me
rits of his mechanical genius.
Nothing can tend more to the public welfare than such inven
tions as promote the interest of the farmer and merchant, which
the machines above mentioned will effe&ually do. The ma
chine for clearing docks will be of infinite service in cutting and
deepening canals, for draining marshes and water ponds, and even
to those farmers who live near rivers and creeks which contaiii
black mud, well known to be the best manure.
The reaping machine is certainly a very great invention, being
on a plan both simple and cheap, and may be used by a perfoh
who never saw reaping before. It may be so conftrufted as to cut
the straw or the heads only. The work will be clean, and fucft
grains as scatter out will all be received in a container. It may
either be worked by man or horse.
Thethrefhing machine is superior to every thing of the kind ever
yet invented.
The inventor's plan for working boats by a horse, against the
strongest stream, or raising great quantities of water to an> height,
must be allowed, by every mechanical genius, to be entirely new,
and of the greatest utility.
The inventor of the above machines is recommended by gentle
men ofthe greatest rcfpe&ability in Baltimore : wc have 110 rcafon
therefore to doubt his abilities.
Mr. Harbough is the person who turned an arch under a court
house (a veryfpacious brick edificein Baltimore) many years after
it was built, a similar instance to which we never have heard of
before.
A few days since died, at Elizabeth-Town, very much regret
ted, the LADY of His Excellency William Livingston,
Esq. Governor of the State of New-Jersey.

WEALTH EXAMINED.
[Continued from our
IT was by flattery,bribery,artifice,and violence,
that Marius andApuleius prevailed with the peo
ple to continue tlieir power, in opposition to all
that the senate could do to prevent it. Wliat
Mould have been the consequence then if there
had been no senate ? Would not the majority of
the people in the tribes have continued their
power, againit all that could have been done by
the minority ? Would not ftillmore of the pub
lic lands, money, and grain, have been laviihed
npon proper inftruinents among the majority, and
the minority have been compelled to pay the ex
pence ? Our author affects to fay, that the " fe
" l-.ate and people continued the power of Pom*
" pey and Cxfar." But Ctefar himielf knew it
was the people, and notthe senate ; and if the
senate continued Pompey,it was because Ctefar and
the people laid them under the necessity of doing
it in their own defence. Would Csefar have had
lels " command in Gallia," if the people, or their
successive assemblies, had been poifeffed of all
power ? It is molt obvious, that a majority of
the people, in that cafe, would have continued
Caelar as long as he desired, and have given him
a-; much power as he wilhed : so that every Hep
of our author's progress demonllrates his fyftein
tobefalfe. It is idle to fay, that a continuation
of power increases influence, and spreads cor
ruption, unless you point out a way to prevent
such a continuation of power. To give all power
to the people's successive single representative as
semblies, is to make the continuance of power,
â¢with all its increasing influence and corruption,
certain and inevitable. You may as wifely preach
to the winds, as gravely exhort a triumphant
majority to lay down their power.
It is undoubtedly honorable in any man, who
has acquired a great influence, unbounded confi
dence, and unlimited power, to resign it volunta
rily ; and odious to take advantage of such an
opportunity to destroy a free government : but
it would be madness in a legislator to frame his
policy upon a supposition that such magnanimity
would often appear. It is hisbufinefs to contrive
his plan in such a manner, that such unlimited
influence, confidence, and power, lhall never be
obtained by any man. The laws alone can be
rruftedwith unlimited confidence :âTliofe laws,
which alone can secure equity between all and
every one * ; which are the bond of that dignity
which we enjoy in the commonwealth ; the foun
dation of liberty, and the foundation of equity ;
the mind, the foul, the counsel, and judgment of
the city ; whose ministers are the magistrates,
whose interpreters the judges,whofe servants are
all men who mean to be fieef: âThose laws,
which are right reason, derived from the Divini
ty,commanding lionefty,and forbidding iniquity;
which are silent magiltrates, where the magis
trates are only speaking laws ; which,as they are
fotmded in eternal morals, are emanations of the
Divine mind:f.
If, the life of liberty, and the only remedy
" against felf-intereft, lies in lucceffion of powers
" and persons," the United States of America
have taken the molt effectual measures to secure
that life and that remedy, in establishing annual
elections of their governors, senators, and repre
sentatives. This will probably be allowed to be
as perfect aneftablifhmentof afucceflion of pow
ers and persons as human laws can make : but in
what manner annual elec'tions of governors and
senators will operate remains to be ascertained.
It should always be remembered, that this is not
the fii-ft experiment that was ever made in the
world of elections to great offices of state : how
they have hitherto operated in every great nation,
and what has been their end, is very well known.
Mankind have univerf.illy difcoveredthat chance
was preferable to a corrupt choice, and have trufl
ed providence rather than themfeives. Firlt ma
giltrates and Senators had better be made here
ditary at once, than that the people should be uni
versally debauched and bribed,go to loggerheads,
and fly to arms regularly every year. Thank
Heaven ! Americans underftancl calling conven
tions ; and if the time should come, as it is Very
poiiible it may, when hereditary descent shall be
come a less evil than annual fraud and violence,
iucli a convention may still prevent the firlt ma
gistrate from becoming absolute as well as here
ditary.â 15ut if this argument of our author is
considered as he intended it, as a proof that a
fucceflion of powers and persons in one aflembiy
is the most perfect commonwealth, it is totally
fallacious.

Though Ave allow benevolence ancl generous
affections to exilt in the human brealt, yet every
moral rlieorilt will allow the felfifli palfions in the
generality of men to be the strongest. There
are few who love the public better than them
selves, though all may have foine affection for the
public. We are not, indeed, commanded to love
our neighbour better than ourselves. Self-in
tereft, private avidity, ambition, and avarice,
will exilt in every state of society, and under every
form of government. A fuccellion of powers and
persons, by frequent elections,will not lellen tliefe
passions in any cafe, in a governor, senator, or re
presentative ; nor will the apprehension of an ap
proaching election restrain them from indulgence
if they have the power. The only remedy is to
take away the power, by controuling the felfifh
avidity of the governor, by the senate and house ;
of the senate, by the governor and house ; and
of the house, by the governor and senate. Of
all pollible forms of government, a sovereignty
in one aHembly, fuccelTively chosen by the people,
is perhaps thebeft calculated to facilitate the gra
tification of felf-love, and the pursuit of the pri
vate intereftof a few individuals ; a few eminent
conspicuous characters will be continued in their
feats in the sovereign aflembly, from one election
to another, whatever changes are made in the
feats around them ; by superior art, addrels, and
opulence, by more splendid birth, reputations,
and connections, they will be able to intrigue
with the people and their leaders out of doors,
until they worm out most of their oppofcrs, and
introduce their friends : to this end they will
bellow all offices, contracts, privileges in com
merce, and other emoluments, 011 the latter and
their connexions, and throw every vexation and
disappointment in the way of the former, until
they eftablilh such a fyftein of hopes and fears
throughout the state as shall enable them to carry
a majority in every frefh eledtion of the house.
The judges will be appointed by thein and their
party, and of consequence will be obsequious
enouglito their inclinations. The whole judicial
authority, as well as the executive, will be em
ployed, perverted, and prostituted to the purpo
ses of electioneering. No justice will be attain
able, nor will innocence or virtue be fafe, in the
judicial courts, but for the friends of the prevail
ing leaders : legal prosecutions will be instituted
and carried on against oppofers, to their vexation
and ruin ; and as they have the public purse at
command, as well as the executive and judicial
power, the public money will be expended in the
fame way. No favours will be attainable but by
those who will court the ruling demagogues in
the house, by voting for their friends and inftru
menfs ; and pensions and pecuniary rewards and
gratifications, as well as honors and offices of e
very kind, voted to friends and partisans. The
leading minds and most influential characters a
mong the clergy will be courted, and the views
of the youth in this department will be turned
upon those men, and the road to promotion and
employment in the church will be obftrudted a
gainst such as will not worship the general idol.
Capital characters among the physicians will not
be forgotten, and the means of acquiring reputa
tion and practice in the healing art will be to get
the state trumpeters on the fide of youth. The
bar too will be made so subservient, that a youiif*
gentleman will have no chance to obtain a cha
racter or clients, but by falling in with the views
of the judges and their creators. Even the
theatres, and adtors and actrefles, must become
politicians, and convert the public pleasures into
engines of popularity for the governing members
of the house. Theprefs, the great barrier and
bulwark of the rights of mankind, when it is pro
tected in its freedom by law, can now no longer
be free : if the authors, writers, and printers,
will not accept of the hire that will be offered
them, they must submit to the ruin that will be
denounced against them. The prefles, with
much secrecy and concealment, will be made the
vehicles of calumny against the minority, and of
panegyric and empirical applauses of the leaders
of the majority, and 110 remedy can possibly be
obtained. In one word, the whole fyltem of af
fairs, and every conceivable motive of hope.and
fear, will be employed to promote private
interests of a few, and their obsequious majority:
and there is no remedy but in arms. Accordingly
we find in all the Italian republics the minority
always were driven to arms in despair. " The
