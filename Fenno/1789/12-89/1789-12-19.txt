" We often fancy or forge an effect, and then set
ourselves ai gravely as ridhuloitjly to find out the
caitfe."
FROM a curiosity which is innate in man,
he is of ten hurried into researches after
knowlege on l'uchfalfegrounds,as willbetray him
into decep ion, in proportion as he extends his
purfuiis. If we took nothing for granted, that
had no foundation in facft ; and cherilhed no
principles, that were unfupportcd by reai'on, our
enquiries would be much fewer, and our reflec
tions much less tedious, than they are. Theplea
fure of delusion is so captivating that men reluct
antly bear restraints upon the imagination. No
period of time has been exempt from a variety
of popular fallhoods and errors. Even those ages,
that have been molt celebrated for learning and
philosophy, have been agitated with many frivo
lous disputes, which were deemed important
from the characters who engaged in them, and
from the vanity and zeal that were exhibited
through the difcuflion. How many men, who have
ail'umed the name of philosophers, have exhauft
cd their lives in examining the absurdities and
exploding the heresies of former fecfts or philo
sophers ! How njany persons, who would palm
themselves upon the world as wife and learned
men, have wafted their days in the most labor
ious studies, without discovering an important
truth, or recommending a ufeful virtue !
It would be expecting too much from human
nature, to hope there ever will be a period, when
reason is not liable to be borne away on the wings
of imagination, and when truth is not obfeured
by folly and prejudice. The superstition of past
times, however, is so far diflipated bytlie progress
of science, thatthe road to truth seems.to be more
open and practicable. We hear few storieS of
evil spirits ; doctrine of witchcraft and
enchantments is general!j'exploded. The mind,
relieved from the fears and delusions that such
imaginary evils fuggelt, is left more at liberty to
contemplate upon things that have a real cxift
ence. This gives an advantage to our researches,
by turning our attention to subjects that can be
examined by rational evidence, and afford fonie
degree of precilion and certainty. Our thinking
faculty cannot remain itill and unexerted. It
must have materials for contemplation ; and it
will create ideal and visionary images if acftual
ones are unknown or disregarded. For this rea
son, ignorant people fall a prey to falfe opinions,
and to a thousand imaginary terrors, which an
enlightened mind defpilesand rejecfts.
Curiosity has fucli power over the foul, as to
make it often delight most in pursuing objetfts
that are new and extraordinary. The uncer
tainty of the attainment sometimes puflies us fur
ther into the dark, and when we are involved in
mystery, we do not fufpeift we have wandered
from the truth, but that it is too incomprehenfi
bletobe underftaod. Thus many a man has per
plexed his understanding in seeking causes, for
what never existed, but in his diforuered imagi
nation. Every person should eftablifli it as a rule,
when he hears an aflertion, to enquire as to the
fa (ft alledge'd, before he troubles liimfelf to ex
plore thecaufe of it. By this means, a conlider
able part of the investigations, wlth.il puzzle the
human mind, would be avoided.
In a country where the people are generally
so well educated, as they are in America, they will
not easily be duped by magic tales, or deluded
by enthusiastic rliapfodies. No pretender to any
special communion with invisible beings, whether
they be good or evil, can now draw any number
of people into a delusion. Those who advance
principles that admit not of some clear and ra
tional explication, cannot expeift to propagate
them cxtenfively ; and those, who sport with hy
potheies that appear extravagant, will be called
to the bar of denicrnftration to receive their juit
sentence. Can we then estimate too highly the
advantages of the many schools and universities
which are interspersed over the various parts of
our country ? Can any pains or cxpences be deem
ed too great, for rearing up a generation of men
who will be proof againit the absurdities that have
characterized past ages of ignorance and bigotry ;
and who will have knowledge to understand civil
liberty, and spirit to defend it ? Are any anti
cipations-, too bold and extravagant, of the attain
ments that will probably result from a state of
society fÂ» perfect, as that to which wo are hasten
iug ? How many of the causes, that occasioned
the wre.tchednefsand downfall of antient nations,
Would have been removed, had they been blelled
vith the inltituikms, we now enjoy ?

The President of tlie United States, in
his late tour through this State, was pleased to
honor the town of Marblehead by a ihort visit.
He was received at the entrance of the town, by
the Selectmen, the Clergy of the town, and a
numerous body of Citizens, and was conducted
to the house of Mrs. Lee, where a collation had
been provided, of which he very cheerfully par
took, with the Gentlemen of his Suite, the Select
men, Clergymen and other Gentlemen of the
town.â The President, afterwards, with that at
tention by which he encourages every ufeful em
ployment, vilited one of the Fish Yards, and
exprclled his earnefi wishes for the success of the
indultrious people of Marblehead. Onthisplea
ling occasion, the Selectmen, in the name of the
Inhabitants, had the honor to present their AD
DRESS ; of which, with! the ANSWER of the Prer
fident, we insert the following copies, but lately
received.
TO GEORGE WASHINGTON,
President ok the United States.
SIR,
YOUR presence has inspired the Inhabitants of
Marblehead with the mo It unbounded joy ;
but they cannot express, as they would wiih, their
grateful sense of the honor done them on this
occasion. The two visible decay and poverty of
this town inufl. be their excuse, that they have
not offered to the illustrious Character who now
visits them, a reception more answerable to his
dignity, and more expreflive of their own vene
ration.
The Blessings of Independence and a Republi
can Government must ever excite our gratitude
and affection to so eminent a Supporter of the
Public Liberty, whose wifdotu and valor have so
fuccefsfully defended the rights of his country.
The eltablifhment, by the United States, of a
secure and efficient Government, gives us the
pleating expectation of the gradual revival of our
Fifliery and Commerceâobjects of the indultry,
and principal means of the fubfiltence, of the
Inhabitants of this place, for above a century
previous to the late revolution. In the com
mencement ot the eontelt with Great-Britain,
this Town were early in their exertions in the
common cause ; and were not discouraged, when
they forefaw that reverie of their lituation, which
the war has neceflarily produced. The return
of peace did not restore to us the former advan
tages of the Fifliery, which liarli remained under
peculiar discouragements : and we have yet
patiently to-expect that attention of the General
Governiilent, which may remedy these evils, and
which thefubject may deserve, from its extensive
importance to the commerce of the United States.
The present Government of the United States
commands our ready fubmiflion, and inviolable
attachment : and we deem it a peculiar felicity,
that the highest dignity of that Government is
so properly vested in you ; in whom all America
repose the most entire confidence ; in whose ad
miniftrarion, the world will admire the example
of a Patriot-Rules.
Sir,our anxiety for your lieahli and long life is
proportionate to our most ardent wishes for the
prof'perirv of our country ; and we are well as
sured, that you will ever partake in the happiness
of that numerous people, over whom you preside.
May the Divine Providence continue to favor
your care and guidance of their most important
public affairs, and reward your virtues, which
have been so long employed in promoting the
happiness of mankind.
In behalf cf the Town of Marblehead, Oflober

Fjom Woodfall's Diarv.
IN the year 1767, the ships Indian Queen, Duke
of York, Nancy, and Concord, ot'Briftol, the
Edgar of Liverpool, and the Canterbury, of Lon.
don, lay in old Calabar rjver.
It happened at this time that a quarrel fubifift
ed between the principal in habitants of Old Town
and those of New Town, Old Calabar, which had
originated in a jealousy refpec r ting Slaves. The
Captains of theveflels now mentioned, united in.
fending several letters to the inhabitants of Old
Town, but particularly to Epliraim Robin John,
who was at that time a grandee, and a principal
inhabitant of the place. The universal tenor cf
these letters was, that they were sorry that any
jealousy or quarrel should subsist between the
two parties ; that if the inhabitants of Old Town
would come on board, they would afford them se
curity and protection ; adding, at the fame time,
that their intention in inviting them was, that
they might become mediators, and heal their dis
putes.
The inhabitants of Old Town, happy to find
that their differences were likely to be reconciled,
joyfully accepted the invitation. The three
brothers of the grandee just mentioned, the el
dell of whom was Ambue' Robin John, firft enter
ed their canoe, attended by twenty-seven others,
and being followed by nine canoes, directed their
course to the Indian Queen. They were dispatch
ed from thence the next morning to the Edgar,"
and afterwards to the Duke of York, 011 board or
which they went, leaving their canoe and atten
dants by the fide of the fameveffel. In the mean
time the people 011 board the other canoe, were
either diitributed on board, or lying clofeto the
other ships.
This being the situation of the three brothers,
and of the principal inhabitants of the place, the
treachery now began to appear. The crew of tlie
Duke of York, aided by the captain and mates, and
armed with pistols and cutlafles, rushed into the ca
bin, with an intent to seize the persons of their
three innocent and unsuspicious guests. The un
happy men, alarmed at this flagrant violation of
the rights of hospitality, and struck with alton
ifhment at the behavior of their supposed friends,
attempted to escape through the cabin windows \
but being wounded, were obliged todefift, and to
submit to be put in irons.
Inthefame momentin which this attrocious at
tempt had been made, an order had been given to
fire upon the canoe, that was then lying by the
fide of the Duke of York. The canoe soon filled
and funk, and the wretched attendants were
seized, killed or drowned. Most of the other
ships immediately followed the example. Great
numbers were additionally killed and drowned on
the occasion and others were fwiinming to the
Ihore.
At this juncture, the inhabitans of New-Town,
who had concealed tliemfelves in the bushes by
the water-fide, and between whom and the com
manders of the veflels the plan had been previous
ly concerted, came out from their hiding places,
and embarking in their canoes, made for i'uclias
were swimming from the fire of the Ihips. The
ships boats also were inltantly manned, andjoiu
ed in the pursuit. They butchered the greatest
part of those they caught. Many dead bodies
were loon seen upon the sands, and others were
floating during the whole of the day upon the wa
ter ; and including those that were seized and
carrried off, and those that were drowned and
killed, either by the firing of the ships, or the peo
ple of New-Town, three hundred were loitto the
inhabitants of Old Town on that day.
The carnage, which I have been nowdefcribing
was scarcely over, when a canoe, full of principal
people of New Town, who had been the promotersof the fell eme, tlfopped along-fule of the Duke of
York. They demanded the person of Ambx
Robin John, the brother of the grandee of Old
Town, and theeldeft of the threeon board. The
unfortunate man put the palms of his hands toge
ther, and befeeched the commander of the vetfel
that he would not violate the rights of hospitality,
Jior give up an unoffending itranger to his ene
mies. No intreaties could avail with the harden
ed Christian. Ke received from them a slave of
the name of Econg in his stead, and then forced
him into the canoe, where his head was imme
diately struck off in the fight of the crew, and of
his aiflidrcd and disconsolate brothers. As for
theui, they escaped his late ; but they were car
ried off with their attendants to the European co
lonies, and fold for (laves.
LONDON, October 16.
M. Bouche, deputy from Aix, lately declared,
that t he number of French, who had left their
country, exceeded 80,000, and that their subsist
ing revenue might be dated at 15 or 20 millions.
The scarcity of bread, which threatened a fa
mine at r*aris, and was partly supposed to cause
the late con volfion at Versailles, immediately ceas
ed, and plenty was proclaimed on the King's ar
rival at Paris. Ever since that time the citizens
have been compof'ed and fatisfied refpe<sling the
article of corn.
PARIS, August 2S. .
To prevent the scarcity of bread as much as pos
sible, several families of the patriotic party have
adopted the plan of eating rice inltead of bread,
which has been of great service ; and premiums
havebeen offered to labourers, as an encourage
ment fortheir workingdouble tides, to get in the
harvest, and furnifli the markets with freih grain.
There is no doubt but this scarcity is kept up by
some secret engines of the court party, enemies to
the present revolutions, whofeobject it is to fo
ment disturbances under the present lyftem of
Government. They have succeeded in several
instances, particularly in the frontier towns,
â where large quantities of grain are daily coming
from foreign markets, but are carried off without
any one's knowing what becomes of it.

FROM THE DAILY ADVERTISER OF YESTERDAY.
JUETHOD OF PRESERVING THE BEAUTY
OK TEETH.
FROM A LETTER OF DOCTOR MITCHELL, TO
SOME experiments which I have made upon
human teeth by calcination and solution,
convince me that they contain, particularly in
their outer coat, or covering, a large proportion
of calcario'us earth. This incrustation is
Screened by the arteries of the teeth, and regu
larly depolired all around, to defend them from
outward accidents. When it is corroded or worn
off, and the naked bone exposed to the operation
of air, fpittlc and ailiment, the diseased teeth
soon corrupt. While it remains unhurt and en
tire, they generally continue ufeful and orna
mental. But what avails the knowledge of these
facts, unless we gain some practical advantage by
thtm ? Fi om these fac r ts then, we may learn, that
the enamel of the teeth, which is so remote from
the influence of blood and nerves as to be near
ly allied to inanimate matter, is, like chalk, egg
iliclls and marble, readily a<fted upon by acids.
Whence a fuflicient reason appears, why very
tart apples occasion, soon after eating them, a
fort of soreness or unpleasant sensation in the
teeth ; why the frequent use of sharp vinegar in
pickles and fallads is injurious ; why lemon-juice
and tamarinds are also deitru&ive ; why spirit of
vitriol is itill more ruinous ; and why foot and
tartar, employed as dentrifices, by the acid they
contain, are often productive of irreparable mif
chief âas likewise why young folks who indulge
the pernicious habit of chewing allum, damage
their teeth exceflively. Hence too we may further
learn, that the bell way to preveut thejr decay
and loss, is to wash them frequently with ture
water, and wipe them clean with a foft towel,
and neither chemically cor rode them witn vegeta
ble and mineral acids,nor mechanically wear them
away by fcourinq; with hard and gritty powders.
Does it now feein at all wonderful, as people
are accullomed to take so many hurtful substances
into their mouths, that the teeth should fufler
detriment thereby ? Is it not ra her a matter of
surprise, considering all these things, that many
have any teeth left ? And is not your question,
" Why are bad teeth so common ?" in a gotxl
! measure anfvvered ?âSo far therefore, as the pre â¢
fentfubjec r t extends,the preservation of BEAUTY
depends upon a f'ure and certain principle, easy
to be understood and followed. As to that liar
, mony of shape and features in which the remain
ing part of beauty consists, the pious Mr. Lava,-
ter thinks it is inleparably connected with moral
excellence ; I /hall therefore only add in the sen
timent of this molt able phyfioguoinift, that, the
â way to be handsome, is to be good.

44 History is the Returie&ion of pafl ages."
PERMIT me to recommend to my young readers
the study of history, as the bell, and molt ufeful
source of knowledge :âHere the volume of nature
is unfolded, whole pages are the records of ex
perienceâHere we may learn wisdom of the most
durable and important kindâand enjoy the be
nefit of those rules which result from the trials of
; virtue, and the misfortunes of folly, at theexpence
of part ages. History inspires caution, without
darkening the wind with prejudice, or suspicion
âIt teaches us a just estimate of mankind, and
abates the awkwardness of surprise and wonder,
so natural to the uninformed.
The study of History is at once pleasing and
profitableâlt does not require intense application
âIt may betaken up at a moment ofleifure, and
relinquished as other avocations interveneâand
thus may be made a save-all of the scraps of time,
none of which should be loftâfor, as has been
observed, " of all prodigality, that of time is the
most fhameful."
History elevates the mind to a lofty eminence,
from whence we take a perspective view of the
tranfat r tions of mankindâOf those mighty events
and over-ruling which have deter
mined the fate of Kingdoms, States and Empires
âand while the a<flors on the world's great thea
tre pass in review before us, we are deterred from
adopting the habits of infamy, by the general
fate of vicious examplesâand charmed to a love
of virtue, by the glory and happiness which crown
the actions of the wife and benevolent.
It is difficult to account for the general senti
ment, that History written at the period when
the tranfadtions recorded take place, is common
ly partial, without stigmatizing human nature ;
but the observation has too often been verified, to
be deniedâFear, favor, and affection, in some
form or other,have almost uniformly found means
to influence the pens of cotemporary writers :â
However universal this opinion may be, it is to
be hoped, for the honor and advantage of man
kind, that America will, if /he has not already,
produce Historians who shall intrepidly, and im
partially relate, the great events that her intre
pid sons have atchieved :âThe relation of the
moment, if falfe, may be detected; but if time
rolls his oblivious waves over the transactions of
our country, before they are inferibed on the
page of History, many glorious actions will be
loftâand many a hero will be robbed of the ho
nors that immortality ought to iinprefs on his
memory.
Truth, is a fliort, but comprelienfive motto
âAn liiftorian fliould make it his polar Starâre
jecting triflesâExtraordinarics, both good and
bad, should be faithfully recorded : The truth,
told of bad characters, in a well-wrote History,
holds tlieui up to eveilafting infamyâand makes
them serve as beacons to future agesâwhile it
proves the best elogium on the benefactors of
mankindâwliofe example excites the admiration,
and ensures the imitation of the wife and good,
wliilethey contemplate the fame glorious reward.
To learn the past, and future fate of Man,
With critic eye, the page of Hist'r y scan ;
From facts alone, Wifdotn her maxims draws,
And traces consequences to their cause :
Here Ages to the mind pass in review,
And Nature in the jlifted mirror fliew.
Ilappy the youth, whose free, unfetter'd mind,
Draws from this source, Truth, fimpleand refin'd ;
Who builds on Fa c ts the system of his creed,
And oftly follows whete dictateslr: ci.
UNITED STATES.
RICH M O N D, December
On Monday the twelve amendments to th"
ftitution of the United States proposed by Con'-
grefs were agreed to by the House of Deletes'
This circumstance cannot fail of giving general
fatisfaction to the community at large, Since i
proves thefincerity of thofc who were friends to
the government, when they declared in the Con
vention, that they would join its adversaries in
their endeavours to procure such as were rational
and proper, and would serve to remove the Tem
ples and fears of the confeientious and honelt â¢
For the friends to the federal government favored
these amendments even more than its adversaries.
From hence we may fairly conclude that a gene
ral union of fentinient on this great quelliouwill
Ihortly take place, and that such other amend
ments as may claim the attention ofCongrefs upon
similar principles will be acceded to by them and
us without opposition. The Senate is vet to de
cide upon the fnbjecft before the adoption on the
part of this State is completeâbut as they too are
the Representatives of the people, and 110 doubt
inspired with the fame sentiments of patriotism
andwifhes to quiet the minds of the doubtful, and
apprehensive amongst their fellow-citizensâit
would be indelicate and offenfive even to suppose
that their votes on the subject will be different
from that of the House of Delegates.

people of the United States, Thursday the 26th

be observed, by acknowledging with grateful
hearts the many signal favors of Almighty God,

and the Rev. Mr. Blagrove, chaplain to the gene

Am sent, their cheerful gratitude to show.
44 Now had they wilh'd to lend some mournful f)hi2,

44 Or had some author who in doleful dumps,
44 Trembled for fear his cards should not prove trumps,
44 In Green Room quakipg, like some half-drown'd whelp,
44 In piteous tone, half dead, demanded help ;
44 Then should I, in my element have been,
44 And swept the boards like any tragic Queen â
" Have knit my brows, and told my whining ditty,
44 Such faces made, as must have mov'd your pity.
44 But now I shall not do my duty half,
14 I'm one of those who scarce know how to laugh;
â¢ 4 Tho, for the foul of me, I can't conceive,
44 How any reason I can find to giieve :
Good benefits in spite of our demerits,
Have given us all, a mighty flow of spirits;
And tho I am not equal to my part,
'Tis not bccaufe of an ungrateful heart;
1 feel the favors we each night receive,
And shall be thankful long as I may live.â-
Not I aloneâl represent them allâ
And for the task, indeed I am too small,
For boundlcfs gratitude we sure must feel,
Whilst without bounds your favors thus you deal.

r T*HE afliimptionof the State'Dcbts, by thcGe
neral Government, appears inore and more
interesting: Ic is hardly polfible to conceive how
the peace and tranquility of the Union can be
preserved, and justice done to every denomina
tion of our domestic creditors, npon any other
plan. The idea of the individual governments'
making adequate provilion to pay the interell of
their particular debts, m ufl: prove illuforyâior if,
when they were in poflellion of all their refpe<ftive
funds, it was considered as an oppressive meafnre,
to make competent aflfeflments and appropriations
for this purpose, the. plea of incapacity applies
with additional force, as things are now circurn
ftanced.
It may be expe<sled that this just, and politic
measure, will meet with oppositionâand it is to
be feared,that those who have been advocates for
this aifutnption, may have impreflions made upon
their minds, different from thofethat liave hither
to actuated them, upon a prefuinption that the
States will fund their debts 011 Excises and dry
Taxes. A few reflections will serve, however, to
fliew, that this dependence must fail them : From
long experience, the creditors of the State Go
vernments must be convinced, that their hopes
of future justice in the line they have been in,
reft on a very (lender basisâThey must suppose
that the willingness of the States to pay in future,
will receive ftrengtli from the diminution of their
abilityâand that their desire to give fatisfacTion
to their creditors will call forth resources super
ior to those now vcfted in the General Govern
ment. This is so improbable, that it requires a
ltretch of credulity to countenance thefuppofition.
Butif it fliould be granted, that through the in
fluence of a temporary jealousy of the General
Government, fo-ne of the States may make extra
exertions to fund their debts, it is evident that the
complex system which would grow out of the
measure, must occasion prodigious loss both to the
StatÂ°s' and Continental treasuriesâand in a very
short time the people would consider themselves
as ground between the upper and nether mill
stone :âSuch a situation would iflue in the total
defeat of the hopes founded on State-Financier
ing. The fame funds placed under one set of di
rectors, would probably pay much more, than if
divided under twoâbutif in the hands of twelve
or thirteen different bodies, all atfting indepen
dently of each otherâthe lofles and deficiencies
will not be perhaps less than jopr. cent. In short
the State creditors, by diverting their hopes from
the Stategovernment,will eventually realize their
demands; they may fufFer a temporary suspension
in their receipts, and that is all.âOn the other
hand, they may be amused by a profpeiS: nearer
home, but it will vaniih at last, and leave them
no other resort, than that which now presents,
and which they will then fee, they might have
availed themselves of much sooner, with greater
facility, and more to their advantage* The ope
ration of one general plan of taxation, in conjunc
tion with twelve or thirteen rival systems, must
be attended with inexplicable difficulties.âThe
expcnce of diftincl sets of officersâthe tempta
tions to frauds by different rates of dutiesâthe
difficulty of securing the collecftion upon several
thousand miles of frontier, the incapacitj of the
States to meddle with goods when imported;
and so to check frauds, that power being now in
Congress, and many other reasons, all combine
to (new the absurdity of different and clashing
powers being exerted to effetft that, which ought
to be one bufineft.
NEW-YORK, DECEMBER 19.
We are still in the dark as to the iflue of the
late commotions at Versailles ; and this uncer
tainty is further increased by the contradictory
accounts of the origin of these commotions. If
the King seriously meditated a design of quitting
Versailles and the National Aflembly in order to
join his army,it is probable some system was form
ed, and that,movements among the exiled Princes
may be the consequence, of which it remains that
accounts be received. If the whole affair arose
from a bacchanalian faux pas, it may serve to fug
ged a ufeful hint to the National AHembly: viz.
?o quicken their diligence in perfecting the new
Constitution, since there is no calculating the va
riableness of the popular opinion.
Extrall of a letter from North-Carolina,Dec. 2,1 7Â°9-
The only news I have to write you is that the
Convention of this State, contrary to general
expectation has ratified the Constitutionâand
that our Grand Master, the late Governor Cas
well is dead.
On Tuesday the firft inft. the Judicial Court
for the diftrid: of Maine, was
opened in the town of Portland, before the Ho
norable Judge Sewell. The Oaths where then
adminifteredÂ° to the Attorney-General, Marshal,
and Clerk, and the Court adjourned.
Bv late accounts from Charleston, S. C. it ap
pears, that all the public offices in that city have
been removed to Colunibia, the new feat of govern
ment. This measure may poffibty be produdivc of
advantage to the State ; but in the infancy of our
countryT it certainly appears hostile to the great
interest of the whole, to discourage tne_ capital set
tlements upon the lea coast. In thisviewthe/ro
bability is, that after incurring very great expence,
the landed isitereft: will feci tlie necessity ofagti'ni
removing the.feat of government, and fixing it
in its original lituation. The spirit of freedom
firtt appeared in our capital sea ports ; from thence
fpreaa into the interior country. Our capitals are
the feats of the arts, the Emporiums of trade,
the deposits, and refourccs of our wealth ; and
every meal'ure that contributes to their increale
and molt ellentially contribute tothe
general interelt.
I'he funding of the State debts by the respec
tive governments will be a measure fraught with
niifchievous consequences. There will be excilt-.-J
upon the impolt, and perhaps excise againlt ex
cil'e, confufion on confulionâtrade will be em
barraded; manufactures, protected by the iin
poft, will be saddled in the consuming States with
excises ; a contest for power and revenue will en
sue, tothe reviving of bitter animosities, and the
deltruction of public credit. These ideas strong
ly suggest the propriety of placing the National
and State debts upon one and the fame footing :
The fame principle of justice pleads for the for
mer that does for the latter.
The State creditors,provided they are left to de
pend on the particular governments,will become
interested to diminilh the National revenue, in
'Â»rder to brighten their own prospects. But it must
be remembered, that they will, at the fame time,
be divided into twelve or thirteen different bodies,
that never did, and never can ad: conjointly in a
business of this kind; while the general Govern
ment, having one system pervading the whole Uni
on, mutt aCt to more certain eff,*Ct. The State
creditors, therefore, detached from the conti
nental, mult be fnlferers; but united with them,
and having the concentered fnnds of the United
States to depend on, their fate is involved, not in.
the fluctuating councils of a particular State, but
in the fate of the whole Continent.
Provided our national credit was established ill
such manner as to bring the public securities to
a fixed and certain value, what relief would trade,
manufactures, and agriculture derive from a per
manent influx of circulating medium ! This
desirable event doesjnotinaterially depend on the
rate of interelt, but on the certainty of the quan
tum which government can, and will pay. This
point fettled, the value of public paper will be
ascertained, and no future fluctuations of any
consequence will ensue. This conlideration, a
mong thousands of others that might be mention
ed, points out the absolute neceflity that fumething
lliould be done immediately.
The inequality of circumstances which prevails
among mankind, may be traced to a variety of
causes. Accident has no fmallfhare in producing
this disparity. But of all the causes that maybe
adduced, there is none to be compared to thole
which arifefroin the means of education : For tho
we often fee the foils of genius and learning, in.
wantandindigence ; yet in afree country, where
the avenues to honor and emolument are open to
all, we (hall find that by far the majority, owe
their eligible circumstances totheir early advan
tages of education - So that one capital source ot"
envy,which is agreater difturberof human happi
nels than manyare apt to imagine, may very ea
sily be removed by making suitable public provi
sion for ditleminating knowledge among all clafles
of the people.
There is a natural propensity in mankiud to re
duce all to one common level. Dean Swift's ob
servation is therefore founded on a just acquaint'
ance with humaa nature, when he fays,
Your altitude offends the eyes
Of those who want the pow'r to rife.
For tho it must be acknowledged, that elevated
circumstances often induce and are conneifted
with adomineering disposition, yet the desire to
rife, is asuniverfal asexiltence ; and the preferv
ationof personal poflefHons is a right that cannot
be monopolized or usurped, without violating,
theprinciples ot liberty. As the wheel of huinaa
affairs is in perpetual rotation, the poor (hould
remember that tliey, or their posterity, may be
come interelled in a sacred regard to the rights
of property and its consequent diftinCtions.
The study of geography isuniverfally approv
ed, and very generally introduced into our se
minaries of learning ; with this branch of edu
cation, liiftory appears to be very naturally con
nected ; and if added to the circle of studies, as
it might be with great ease, even in our molt in
ferior i'chools, it would prove a source of very va
luable improvement.

LETTER XXIII.
Amsterdam, Oct. 27, 1780.
SIR,
/~\L EST ION twenty-fifth.â" Do they who have
loft their or fortunes by the mar, en
dure it patiently, as cow-patriots, Jo tbat nothing
can be feared from them ?"
Losing fortunes in America lias notfuch dread
ful consequences, to individuals or families, as
it has in Europe. The reason is obvious ; be.
caule the means of fubfillence are easier to be ob
tained, so that nobody fuffers for want. As far
as I am acquainted with fufferers. they have borne
their lolles, both of poverty, and relations, with
great fortitude ; and, lo far from producing in
their minds a desire of lubmiffion, they have on
ly served to irritate them, âto convince them
more fully of the precarious and deplorable situ
ation they would be in under the government of
the Engliih, and to make them more eager to
refill it.
Oueftion twenty-sixthâHow has it gone with
" the cultivation oj the land, before the troubles, at
" their commencement, and at present ? What change
" has taken place
Agriculture ever was, and ever will be, the
dominant interest in America. Neverthelels, be
fore this war, perhaps, she run more into com
merce than was for her interest. She depended
too much, perhaps, upon importations for cloath
ing, uteniils, &c. and indulged in too many lux
uries. When the profpetfl opened in 1 775, of ail
interruption of her commerce, lhe applied her
felf more to agriculture ; and many places that
depended upon the lumber trade, tilefifhery, &c.
lor the importation of even their bread, have
turned their labor and attention to railing corn,
wool, flax and cattle, and h*ave lived better, and
advanced in wealth and independence fatter than
ever they did. For example, the towns in the
neighborhood of the sea, in the Maflachufetts'
Eay, uled to depend upon the filhery and com
merce, to import thein their wheat and flour
from Philadelphia, Maryland, and Virginia, and
rice from South-Carolina and Georgia : The
communication being interrupted by sea, since
the war, they have planted their own corn.
The caftern parts of the Maflachufetts' Bay,
before the war, depended on the commerce of
lumber for the Weft-India market, and of masts,
yards, and bowsprits, for the royal navy of Great
Britain, to procure them cloaths, meat, andftrong
liquors. Since the war, they have cultivated
their lands, raised their own corn, wool, flax ;
and planted the apple tree, instead of drinking
rum: In consequence of which they are more
temperate, wealthy, and independent than ever.
North-Carolina depended upon the commerce
of pitch, tar and turpentine, and tobacco, for
the importation of many things. Since the war,
they have turned their labor toraifemore of the
things which they wanted.
Maryland, Virginia, and North-Carolina, de
pended upon the trade oftobacco to import coarse
cloths for their negroes. Since the war, they
have raised less tobacco, and more wheat, wool,
and cotten, and made the coarse cloths themselves!
So that, upon the whole, the letlening of com
merce, and the increase of agriculture, has
rendered America more independent than lhe
ever was. I have the honor to be, &c.

EXTRACTS.
i oni a POEM on the Bill lately pafled for regu
lating the Slave Trade.
By Miss HELEN MARIA WILLIAMS.
From the MONTHLY REVIEW, Jqr March, i 789.
j HE accounts lately given, fay the Reviewers,
to the public, refpot'ting the Slave Trade, were
horrid enough to call into vigorous exercise the
amiable feniihi.ity of the. female breast. By
ladies this subject lias been contemplated through
the pure medium of virtuous pity, unmixed with
rhofe political, commercial, felfiih considerations
which operated in (feeling the hearts of some
men againftihe pleadings of humanity ! To find
THEM, therefore,writing on i-.,by 110 means exci
ted wonder.âThough among the Ir.ft, Miss Wil
liams is not the least deserving notice. Ineafy,
harmonious verse die pours fourth the fentiinents
of her mind nor do we recollect among tlie
poems that have lately attracted our attention, to
haveperufed one with more pleasure than that
which now lies before us.
She thus addrefles her country on the fubjeift of
her poem :
13rITAJN! the noble, blest decree
That sooths despair, is fram'd by thee !
Thy powerful arm has interpos'd,
Ancl one dire scene forever clos'd ; %
Its horror fhali no more belong
To that foul drama, deep with wrong.
O, firftof EUROPE'S polifh'd lands,
To ease the captive's iron bands !
Long as thy glorious annals shine,
This proud diftin&ion (hall be thine :
Not firft alone when valor leads
To ru(h on danger's noblcft deeds :
When mercy calls thee to explore
A gloomy path untrod before,
Thy ardent spirit springs to heal !
And, greatly gen'rous, dares to feel !
Valor is like the meteor's light,
Whose partial flalh leaves deeper night;
While mercy, like the lunar ray,
Gilds the thick fhadc with fofter day.
Tlielaft lines of this extra# lead us to observe,
that our poetess is peculiarly happy in the choice
and application of her limilies :
The traders in Haves are described as beings,
Whose harden'd fouls no more retain
Impreflions nature ftamp'd in vain ;
All that diftinguilhes their kind,
For ever blotted from their mind ;
As dreams that once the landscape gave,
Refle&ed on the trembling wave,
Their substance change, when lock'd in froft,
And reft, in dead contraction loft ;
Who view unmov'd, the look, that tells
The pang that in the bosom dwells.
The picture that follows, of the wretched Ne
gro just landed in the Weft-Indies, and fold; is
extremely natural :
When borne at length to western lands,
Chain'd on the beach the captive stands,
Where man, dire mcichandize, is fold,
And barter'd life is paid for gold ;
In mute affliflion, fee him try
To read his new pofleffor's eye ;
If one blest glance of mercy there,
One half-form'd tear may check delpair !
What is said of avarice mull not be here omit,
ted :
His sway the harden'd bosom leads
To cruelty's remorseless deeds ;
Like the blue lightning -when it springs
With fury on its livid wings,
Darts to its goal with baleful force,
j Nor heeds that ruin marks itscourfe.
