u iVa mortal is so miferabl:, from his oiu/i inborn
Jfirit, as a covetous man."
THE love of wealth, is a passion attended
with io mnch utility, that no reafooable
man will discourage the exercise of it. This
passion, however, when it prevails inordinately,
defeats its own purposes, andfnbje<fts its pofielibr
to the tnoft painful inquietudes. The predomi
nating feature of a man of real covetoulnefs is, a
reluctance to put his money out of his immediate
controul. By such a precaution, he accumulates
less rapidly than he craves, and endures a perpe
tual conflict, between a deftre to encrsafe and aJear
to lose.
It is likewise a characteristic of this paflion to
be conrtant and unabating. An avaricious man
has no relief from the anxieties of his craving
difpofirion. If he meets with lofles it fills him
with agony: If he prospers in what he undertakes,
it heightens his solicitude about the prefenration
and management of his property. Other paflions
may rage with more vehemence, but they act by
intervals, and sometimes scarce operate at all.
Another property peculiar to avarice is, that it
gains strength by age. When the fire of youth
is abated ; when the ambition of middle age has
loft its ardor, the old man still has a source of gra
tification, securing, or in adding to his wealth.
It is a happy circuinftance that the love of money
encreafes in the decay of life. This propensity
maybedeemed a fubltitute for the loft of other
amufeinents ; and riches will support the influence
ofa man when talents and activity have fallen a
facrifice to the inroads of time. Theluftreof
opulence will supply the place of utiderftanding,
llot only where it never existed, but where it has
yielded to declining nature.
But the molt extraordinary effe<t of avarice is,
the solicitude it begets with refpedt to the appro
priation of an ellate, when a man bids adieu to
earthly scenes. The pangs that a covetous man
feels, in anticipating the profligate manners, in
which his hoardings may probably be squander
ed, are greater than can be described. This an
ticipation is often attended with such pain, that
the covetous man bequeaths his interest to some
public institution, that it may be kept entire, and
not fall into hands who will spend it by dissipa
tion, or misapply it, by indiscretion. Ithasoften
been remarked, that very avaricious people dis
cover a capricious kind of liberality in the diftri-.
bution of their ellate by legacies, to thole who
have no natural claim upon it. This is sometimes
afcribcd to vanity, but it more usually results
from a fear of misapplication of the money,fhoiild
it devolve upon the apparent heirs. A temper
of misanthropy is too apt to be connected with that
of avarice, It may therefore happen that a per
son of a covetous disposition may have so much
hatred for those whom he knows, and to whom
he is related, that he cannot bear the idea of pro
moting their welfare, by enjoying his property,
when he is dead, any more than while he was
alive. From this cause, he devotes it to public
uses, or perhaps with an air of refined generosity,
leaves it to strangers, whom he cannot hate, be
cause he does not know them.

MR. FEN NO,
THAT, iu a country, whose inhabitants have been
educated with a determined hatred against
France, the present revolution Ihould be mis-re
presented, fometimesin themoft scurrilous lan
guage, is perhaps an unavoidable weakness of
human nature; but that thcfame language Ihould
be repeated 111 American papers, is so inconsist
ent with American candor, and with the history
of paj} events, that if we had not the experience
of several mouths, we ihould honor human na
ture too much to believe it. It is equally sur
prising, that in the midst of all this abuse, not
one paragraphânot one line has been publish
ed, south of Bojlon, to inspire some doubts on
the veracity of those publications. To prove
in particular the great candor of some printers,
who are attentive to give us the newe/t news of
Parisian tranfadtions, we beg you to re pnblifh
the enclosed accounts of the London Evening
Pofl, which, un-like the World, and some other
papers, is not under the immediate influence of
Calonne, and his creatures. We do not re
quest the printers to translate French papers,
We only requeftthem to give impartially a copy
of all the English papers in their pofleflion.
Designedly to insult the feelings of a whole
nation, may perhaps be attended with more
disagreeable consequences than some are aware
of- S. F. P.
PARISIAN INTELLIGENCE.
NATIONAL ASSEMBLY.
Monday, Nov. 2.
HP HE grand question of the right, to dispose
X of thepofleffions of the church, was relum
ed ; and decided in the following terms, drawn
up by M. de Mirabi. au.
" The National Aflembly declares :
" That all the goods of the church are at the
disposal of the nation, charged only with provid
ing, in a suitable manner, for the expence ofdi
-vine wor/hip, the maintenance of its ministers
and the relief of the poor, under the infpecftion
and according to the inftrutftions of the provin
ces.
" That in the dispositions to be made for the
maintenance of the ministers of religion, every
vicar shall be secured in a stipend, not less then
1200 livres a year, besides a house and garden."
The decree, thus drawn up, was carried by
578 voices, against 346.
Forty members objected to the terms in which
the question was put, and refufed to vote ; so
that the number present was 964.
Tuesday, Nov. 3.
The adjourned question of Thursday last was
put to the vote, in the following terms :
" Has it been decided, that the sons of a fami
ly are comprehended under the difqualification
which excludes from the National Aflembly all
persons who do not pay a tax to the value of a
mark offilver, and poflefs no property whatever "
The Aflembly resolved that it had been so de
cided.
In the debates on this article several members
contended that the fuffrage of the electors should
be the only qualification requisite for a member
ci the National Aflembly, without any regard to
property or taxation. This was over-ruled â¢ and
the payment of a tax to the value of a mark offil
<-ei, arising from any species of property, fettled
as the neceflary qualification, it was then propo
sed that the payment of a tax to this amount, by
t;ie father of a family, should qualify all his sons
of proper age ; because, it was said, by the con-
Irrut'uon of the Roman law, which Was the of
jurisprudence in many parÂ«of France, sons were
lncapableof acquiriligproperty in their own name
during the life of their father. This was reject
ed as above. J
The article, however, is still of, as
requiring a qualification that will exclude nine
tenths of the kingdom, and almost all the lower
Clergy, from the National Aflembly.
The plan for dividing and sub-dividing the
kingdom into departments, commonalties, and
diftridis, was taken into consideration ; and M.
Thouret, the author ofit, read afpeech, in which
he endeavored to obviate the objections that had
been made to it, and maintained that it was the
only means of eradicating that esprit de corps
which usually animates the provinces to the de
triment of the common interest. This speech
was received with much applaul'e, and ordered
to be printed.
M. deMirabeau objected to this plan, and pro
posed one of his own. The principal difference
between M. Thouret's, and his is, that the former
endeavors to combine three fundamental princi
ples, territory, population, and property ; the
latter, population and property only. M. de Mi
rabeau's plan was also ordered to be printed.
M. de Lameth, after paying due praise to the
parliaments, especially for the firm opposition
they had often made to the attempts of despotism,
observed, that these bodies having, for several
ages, enjoyed a fort of legislative power in con
cert with the crown, there was reason to fear that
they would oppose, with all their influence, the
success of a revolution which went to deprive
them of that power. He therefore proposed, not
to abolish them immediately, but to leave them
in a Hate of vacation, and to entrust their func
tions to the Chambers of Vacation.
M. Target seconded the motion, and it was de
creed.
" That, till the National AfTembly can apply
to the new organization of the judicial power,
all the parliaments in the kingdom (hall continue
in, or resume a state of vacation ; that the cham
bers of vacation shall continue or resume their
functions, and take cognizance of all causes and
procefles, any regulation to the contrary not with
standing, till further orders ; and that all the other
tribunals shall continue to administer justice in
the usual manner.
" That the President shall wait upon the King,
and request hiin to expedite all neceflary orders
and letters."
M. Bailly was introduced at the head of a de
putation from the magistracy of Paris, and pre
sented a provisional plan of police, for the ap
probation of the National Aflembly. The plan
wes referred to the Committee of Constitution.
NOT E.
* Chambers of Vacation are those which take cognizance of
all matters that require dispatch, while the courts to which they
belong do not fit ; or, as we (hould fay, bt tween term and term
Each Parliament has its Chamber of Vacation.
Wednesday, Nov. 4.
The President informed the Aflembly that the
King had given the Royal fanrtionto all the de
crees pref'ented to him.
The difcuflion of the proposed new division of
the kingdom was relumed.
Several members were for adopting the plan
presented by the Committee of Constitution (M.
Thouret's,) without any amendment or modifica
tion. Others were against any new division, as
dangerous and impracticable.
M. Defmeuniers maintained the former opinion
.rid infupport ofit, instanced the defects in the
. presentation in England, which he said were
radical, and wuft sooner or later destroy the li
berty of the country. This danger conid only be
avoided, by combining territory, population, and
property, as the fundamental principles of repre
sentation, instead of confining it to territory alone
which might often be fully represented in the
legislature, when the population and the proper
ty, which originally gave it consequence, were
transferred to another place, not represented at
M. Barnave proposed amendments to the plan
ot the Committee to the following effect:
" The kingdom shall be divided into twenty
four pans, or nearly Co, with a provincial admi
nl ft ration m each. These again into three or
tour dittri&s, or more, with an assembly of ad
mimltration in each, subordinate to the provin
cial administration.
The extent of territory and population re
qmfite to form a municipality, lhall be determin
ed, and atrer fetling the other principles of or
ganization the establishment of municipalities
shall be referred to provincial aflfemblies.
1 " P. 0 ? 1 " 105 to the National Aflembly shall
be e erted ,n the principal towns of the diftrkts,
by electo. sell,fen immediately by the people, in
each municipality, in such manner, that no Aflbm
bly of Electors shall consist of less than three hun
dred or nominate more than four Deputies to
the National Aflembly.'*
In all these plans it seems to be an admitted
principal, that the deputies of the National As
sembly are not to be chosen immediately by the
people, but by the electors chosen by the people
f his principle we apprehend to be erroneous â¢
irk f t . heme, " bers the National Aflembly
ate cholen immediately by the people, without
the intervention of an intermediate body there is
reason to fear that the Aflembly will not always
(peak the sense of ilie people, or, at least n
in some cases, it will not do so as fooii aÂ«it L,!?'

Saturday, Nov. 7,
The debate on M. de Mirabeau's motion, for empowering his
Majesty's ministers to fit and advise in the National Affcrably,
was refumed.âlt was warmly opposed by M. Lanjuinais, who
said that, not the \ote, but the eloquence and influence of mi
nisters were to be dreaded in the aflembly. He moved that the
representatives of the nation shall not be capable of accepting any
place in the ministry, during the legislature of which they are
members, nor for three years after ; nor of receiving any emolu
ment, favor, or employment from the executive power.
This motion was generally understood to be pointed at M. de
Mirabeau, who is luppofed to have been negociating wiiliM.
Necker for a place in the adminil\ration. He opposed it on ge
neral principles, and desired that it might not go beyond its mark;
but that theexclufion be limited to hira only, against whom alone
it was evidently meant.
M. de Mirabeau's motion was reje&ed ; and it was carried by
a great majority, u That no member of the National Assembly
shall hold any place in the administration, during the present
session."
The eligibility of ministers to befmembers of the legislature in
future, was adjourned, and referred to the committee ofconfti
tution.
A letter was read from the keeper of the seals, dating that his
Majesty had accepted the nine articles of the constitution prefent
ted to him yesterday, and fanftioned three other decrees prefenteJ
at the fame time.
The Bishop of Autun observed, that the aflembly haying de
clared the right of the nation to difpofejof the goods of the church,
there was reason to fear that the idea might get abroad, that they
were open to the disposal of individuals. He therefore moved,
to preserve them from dilapidation.
That thejudges, in ordinary, throughout the kingdom, should
affix their frals of office to all archives and depots of titles of
church property intheabbies, monasteries, &c. &c. (
That ecclesiastical property, its produce, and cfpecially the
woods should be put under the immediate protection of theKiog,
the provincial aflemblies, and other bodies of administration.
That all persons guiity of embezzling or secreting property,
ortitle deeds, should be proceeded against, and punished, asgu'Â»"
iy of tltefr.
That thejudges in ordinary, should be direfied to enquire into,
and profccute all offences, and to give an account to the Nationa
AfTembly of the informations they received, and their proceed
ings upon them, without prejudice to the jurifdiftion of the on
cers des maitrifes (officers whose jurifdi&ion extends over woods
and waters.)
That the officers des maitrifes should be particularly vigilant to
prevent the cutting of wood contrary to the laws, on pain of an
swering to the nation for their neglect.
1 he consideration of the firft article was postponed ; theoticr
four were decreed.
M. Threillard moved to suspend the nomination to all benefi
ces, except Archbifhopricks, Bifhopricks, Rectories, Dignities*
and Canonries of the cathedral Churches; and that all reflations
and exchanges of benefices, except of those above-mentioned, an<j
also all letters and refenpts from Rome refpe&ing them, lhou
be null and void.
1 he consideration of this motion was adjourned till Monday
M. Martmeau presented the plan of a decree to oblige rcclcli
aftics pofTeffing a benefice or benefices, to the annual amount 0
a thoufarid crowns, to resign all others they might hold above
that value.
To oblige all beneficiaries to residence, on pain of deprivation-
I o suppress all monasteries and religious societies, except l 0
employed in educating youth. 1
I o declare, that in the monasteries and religious societies to
prefcrved, no person, in future, shall take vows that deprive 1
of his civil existence, or the liberty ofquitting the focicty, * n
he shall think fit to renounce the advantages ot it. . l c
1 o suppress all Abbey and Collegiate benefices, and ap? >
revenues of them to the use of the public.
The consideration of this plan was also adjourned.
Exhatt of a letter from Paris, November 9.
After the strong opposition made to M. Chenier's, ChaÂ» es '
that tragedy is at length represented with an .applause not n .
here since the days of Voltaire. The charatfers are taken n
history, and, two or three of them excepted (the Great | '
the honcft Chancellor de I'Hofpital, and the brave and virtu _
Admiral Coligny) form a group that fix an indelible U t L 0 _
human nature. The fubjeft is the horrid maflacre of St. B ar Â«
lomew, the severest satire upon falfe religion, blind kisÂ°* r \\j na l
inordinate ambition, that was exhibited to the world. j' aj 0 n
Lorraine is introduced, in his purple robe, giving his bene Â»
to his Catholic army, and diipenling absolutions to tho e
were on the point of setting out to embme their hands lpblood of .their innocent, unoffending fellow-citizens. The au
thor has drawn with a masterly hand the irresolute, timid, and
cruel Charles; the gloomy and perfidious policy of Catharine of
Mcdicis; the arrogance and aspiring views of the haughty Duke
of Guise ; and the clerical zeal, vindiftivenefs, and pride of the
Cardinal. Nor has he been less happy in his portraits of the

GHENT, November 7, 1759.
Friday morning a little before 8 o'clock, about
2000 Patriots who cainc from the diftriift of Waes,
appeared before the Saxon and Bruges gates of
this city, and after a short contest made them
selves mailers of the city, driving the soldiers
who guarded the gates, and beingjoined by ma
ny of the Patriots in Ghent, soon overpowered
the main guard, who were either killed or dis
persed. During this the troops in the Caserns
of St. Peter, having divided into two columns,
those on the right marched to Water.PortUridge,
having the river in front; the other took poll at
the Kettle Gate, having the aforefaid river also
in front; Co that these columns could not be at
tacked except in front, at a great disadvantage,
for ihey had the command of the ground every
way : Notwiihltanding their feveraladvantages,
the Patriots attacked them, and after an obstinate
engagement with cannon and muftpietry for 10
hours, the military were driven to their Caserns,
leaving many dead and wounded, the exact num
ber not kuown. The fame night a corps of 200
men, with 3 cannon, marched out of the Caserns
into the suburbs among the Burghers ; the fame
on Saturday ; and on Sunday the Patriots at
tacked the troops and drove them off, but the
military returned at night, and began to wreak
their vengeance in the molt cruel manner.by fire,
robbery, and murder. On Monday at day break
they returned to the fame quarter, but were beat
off by thp Patriots; they returned again at night
withfuch fury and vengeance, that they did not
even spare fucking babes at the brealts of their
mothers.
During these commotions, there was a continu
al firing from the castle with red-hot and other
cannon balls, which dellroyed all the houses and
buildings in the vicinity ; and the garrison con
tinued to sally out every night to plunder and
drag all they could lay hands on prisoners into
the callle.
As the garrison in the Caserns continued to kill,
to murder, and to destroy by fire ; the Patriots
under thecommand oftheHeer Van Ilcllum, ani
mated with a determination to put an end to
these excefles, about 10 o'clock in the afternoon,
attacked the garril'on in the Caserns with such
undmmted spirit, that about 4 o'clock in the af
ternoon they surrendered prisoners of war, con
fiftingof more than 600 men,with theircomman
dant, a major ; and tliey were marched bare
headed through the city, and imprisoned in dif
ferent cloyfbers. 011 Monday night the garrison
of the caltle, finding themselves in a diitrelled
situation, abandoned the fame, and fled by Dum
port to Dendermond ; so that at present we are
relieved from a band of desperate barbarians,
who may truly be (tiled regimented a[fajfins.

" His bounty like a flowing tide,"
Extends its blessings far and ivide.
GENEROUS, munificent spirit, is the molt
perfecft representative of Deity, that can be exhi
bited by mortality : As human life consists in a
feriesof inquietudes, to raise the deprefled, and
to lighten the burthens which bow down the chil
dren of misfortune, are the delightful employ
ments of the feeling, and benevolent heart.
Alonzo is a gentleman, who by a fucceflion of
prosperous incidents, has acquired more than a
competency of the goods of fortuneâpofl'effing a
native goodness of disposition, his generous pro
pensities have expanded, as his wealth has increa
sedâand his chief happiness, in the acquisition
of property, appears to result from its enlarging
his fpliere of action, and munificence. Not con
fined to transient objedts ofinifery, his benevolence
seeks the abodes of the wretched, and often the
deserted children of want receive unexpected re
lief, when their hearts are finking with despon
dency :âThe ividaiv, and the fatherlefs âthe in
dultrious poorâare ilie objects of his wide extend
ed bountyâWhen under painful anticipations of
fuffering from hunger, cold, and nakedness, fud*
denly their fears are diflipated by supplies of
fuel, food and cloathingâwhile the hand of the
generous donor forever remains invilible and un
known.
But tho Alonzo despises the parade of Charity,
yet he realizes the power of example in-promo
ting acts of general public utility : Hence you fee
his name in every subscription, for the advance
ment of those institutions, which are designed to
benefit the poor, and to leflen the avenues toidle
nefs and want. Soineobjeifts ofcommon, andex
tenfive importance, require the joint exertions of
numbers, Alonzo is always conl'picuous in his
exertions upon such occaftonsâand witliinduftry
and perseverance every obstacle is surmounted,
till plans are brought to maturity, which conduce
to the honor, the wealth, and happiness of the
community. Such men are the stewards of the
blessings ofprovidenceâtheir property is the pro
perty of the public, and their wealth is the Bank
of the poor. Their characters give aluftreto
the place where they reside, and their good name
is a prop to their country in every emergency.
Do we not know such charadlers ? Let their works
point tliein outâTheir praise is in the city.
The good man cannot but be generous, tho the
public acknowledgments of gratitude are a severe
tax upon his feelings.
Contrasted with such men, the Miser is like a
barren, insatiable foil, which the more moillure
it. imbibes, the harder, and more unproductive it
grows. Enormous wealth, accumulated in the
coffers of the avaricious, and there confined, is
like exhausting the blood from the constitution.
It is drying up the sources from whence those
channels are supplied, which nourilh, fructify
and fertilize the world : Their characters are
conflantly suspended upon the pointed pinnacle
of satire while they live, and their memory is the
sport of execrations, when Death unlocks the
iron repositories of their hoards, and gives their
wealth to their prodigal posterity.
NEW-YORK, DECEMBER 30.
We are now brought to the conclusion of the
year Eighty-Nine.âWhat an eventful period
has it been ! The molt sanguine expectations did
not anticipate what we now realize. At this time
last year, we were looking forward with anxious
expectation to the organization of the new Go
vernment : And while the minds of the gloomy
and discontented, foreboded and predicted a se
ries of difficulties, dangers and unavoidable e
vils, the friends of peace, the honest and unfuf
pecling friends of freedom and good government
trembled in hope. But through the favor of hea
ven, what is now our situation ! A form of go
vernment for a various people, and an extend
ed territory, brought into operation with the
happiest facility ; and organized to the perfect
fatisfacftion of the citizens. Peace, plenty and
freedom reign in our borders, and innumerable
catifes are powerfully operating to produce pre
fetit and future happjnefs to our country. âThe
dreams of anarchy are no moreâthe rays of
knowledge diverge in every possible direction.
Arts, manufactures and commerce raise their long
deprefled heads ; and protected by our equal laws,
and an efficient government, are extending their
influence far and wide.âOur resources are un
folding; our burthens are diminishing; right
principles are taking root, and government is
considered in ajuftpoint of viewâand as the
choicell gift of heaven. The revolution in our
political Situation is great; but the revolution in
our principles is greater. âThese are the events
of ayear! A yearthat Stamps our character with
fame immortal ; the wisdom and magnanimity of
which arefufficient to wipe off the reproaches of
ages. Our enjoyments may jultly be heightened
with the reflection, that our example has proved
contagious to the nations of Europe ; who, under
the favor of Providence, are now in the high
road to a glorious llate of freedom and jult go
vernment.
The labors of theObferver, a writer, whofeper
formances firft appear in a Hartford paper, are
entitled to the thanks of his countrymen, for un
folding many fyflems of State policy, which now
appear to be a grievous burthen on the people.
The speculations of this writer ought to be read
by every citizen ; for it is demonstrated by him,
that a Amplification of our numberless State re
gulations, will save millions to the people.
A bill of rights for freemen appears to be a con
tradiction in terms. From whom are they receiv
ed ? From thcmfelves ? Do freemen relinquish
those rights that are not fpecified in a bill ? To
whom do they relinquish them ? To themselves, or
their rulers? Who are their rulers but the crea
tures of their own forming? If freemen retain
no rights but tliof'e fpeciiied in a bill, they divest
themselves of thottfands, where they retain one.
What avails a bill of rights to those who violate
the laws ? and in a free country, every right of
human nature, which are as numerous as sands
upon the sea Shore, belong to the quiet, peacea
ble citizen.
Bills of rights owe their origin to circumstances
no ways honorary to the natural independence,
and dignity of human nature. Success on the
part of the barons, in their wars with King John,
extorted that boasted instrument called the bill
of rights. But it may be enquired, whether the
powers not furretidered bv the King, were not
fnppofed to be vested in him.âln that cafe, what
was granted, mult be viewed in the light of a
concession on his part. Its being extorted or vo
luntary, makes no difference in the degrading
idea that connects itfelf with the tranfaCtion.
The truth is, while the people are considered as
the favored party in a bill of rights ; the feeds of
controverted sovereignty are sown in the very
heart of the Constitution.

To the American Planter! and Farmers
THL gentlemen who pollefs and cultivate the
foil, are in this country so numerous, and
hold so great proportion of property, that they
have right t6 a decided influence in the meal'ures
of government. In addressing you I speak to the
people, vvhofe will must ultimately determine the
system of national police. An enlightened plant
er is a friend to manufactures, by which his raw
materials are prepared for the use of manâhe is
a friend to commerce, which converts the surplus
of his perishable produce into permanent wealth,
and mingles the growth ot every clime 011 the
board of hospitality: Still the agricultural now
is, and for a century to come must remain the pre
vailing interest both in riches and in inuence.
The war of independence was yours ) and there
fore became a war of blows too hard for the
common enemyâour present form of govern
ment was firft delineated by those who roll the
tongue and drive the quill ; it became a sacred
reality by the seal of your fuffrages : and the
measures of the treasury department must be
addrefled to your good understanding and sense
of national honor to render them fuccefsful.
Though rhe nature of jour employment is such
as precludes the opportunity of collecting infor
mation ; your judgment must fancftify, and your
firmnefs effectuate the public decrees. The e
vils relulting from a lofsof public creditmayaf
fecft others firftâon you they fall heaviest. Mer
chants, monied men and those who have great
property afloat, are on the watchâthey havelei
fure to collect every informationâacorrefpond
ence by every post and through half the world
advertises them of the evil, and their property
by some change in its situation is secured ; while
you without information and unsuspicious are en
snared. Every poflible imposition in public cre
dit will operate thusâeither the price of your
produce will fall, or the articles you purchase
rife, or the deceitful medium center in your
hands. When the state of credit, In any couu
try, is such as excites a war of artifice between
its citizens, they must be eventual fufferers,
wliofe employment confines them in the field, at
a distance from the course of information. The
firft thing you ought to demand is a stable system
for the public debt, which may be done by plac
ing the whole of every description under one re -
fponfible board ; the next is a circulating medi
um of fixed value. To accomplish this lam sen
sible there must be some kind of direct taxation
by the United States, for it is not probable that
an impost and excise will equitably fund the
whole debt. Direct taxation is now practised
â with a heavy hand by the separate States, and why
ihould the exercise of this power by the general
government be more dangerous, when attended
â with such circumstances that afpart of the sum you
now pay will be fufficient ? If a change of system
will remove half the weight you have borne these
fifteen years, be not duped to lose the opportu
nity, by the artful fuggeltions of some men, who
expect to gain more by the old game, than by a
new one. The members of the general govern
ment are your representativesâyour friends, and
the beings of your own creationâtheir existence
and popularity are in your hands, and they have
every motive to guard your interest ; more can
not be said of the State legislatures. Still fur
ther to remove all suspicions that the writer is
acting an infiduous part, I will compare your
prelent situation with what it might be made, by
an interposition of the general government.
Every State in the empire is heavily in debtâ
in each State there are different modes of impo
ling and collecting taxes, hut in all, direct taxa
tion of some kind is in ul'eâin a few States arbi
trary afleflinent is customary, which may be set
down for the worst kind of iinpofition--in others e.
very kind of property fpecifically is charged at cer
tain rates affixed in the tax lawsâin New-England
your houses and lands, your cattle of every de
scription, even your sons are taxed before their
labor can pay for their support, and your mecha
nics are arbitrarily aflefled for the labor of their
hands. The tax laws have been varied annually,
so that to understand the system of public de
mands is next to impoflibleâthefe changes in the
tax laws, have opentd a succession of speculation
definitive and unintelligible to the unwary citi
zenâThe general taxation of all your proper
ty imperceptibly advances the amountto a griev
ance.âln Connecticut there are one hundred tax
gatherers, and in the other States a number pro
portioned to their extent.âThe gentlemen qua
lified to do this duty, must be men of sagacity
and as such will not forget themselves, nor can
â¢we wilh theyfhould serve the public for nothing.
âAn average emolument to themselves of less
than 200 dollars per annum, would not tempt
them to execute the dutyâthis emolument arises
from a public reward, mileage, forbearance mo
ney, with an opportunity of speculating among
the ignorant; anil tho it be not charged in the
tax bills is eventually paid by the peopleâl blame
not Uie collectors, their business requires industry
and watching, and is attended with risque, for
they must lose the taxes of those who abscond,
alter their warrants are received ; but I accufea
fyftemfo expenfiveto the people. One hundred
tax gatherers at two hundred dollars each amount
to twenty thousand dollarsâthis furn though not
charged in any account whatevei-, is annually
paid by the people of Connecticutâan enormous
burthen ! for the simple collection of taxes, and
all this, on a plan which you have often been told
is mighty cheap, and full of economy and liber
ty. Let us talk no more of the high salaries giv
en by the United States, when our own plan
bears so much harder on the people. The em
ploying too many men in any public business,
that it may be done at a cheap rate, always proves
a fpunge in the event. With the great sums you
have paid, and collected in this expensive man
ner ; with the general taxation of your whole
property, you have not obtained the reputation
of being just to your creditors. The evil still
remains, andmuft temain without a general re
form of system. Most of my remarks will ap
ply to all the States, and as this publication firft
appears in Connecticut, I have taken it as an m
(tance to exemplify the whole.âLet not these
truths excite factionâbe calmâreverence go
vernment, and public justice, and you will be
remedied. Compare with this picture a system I
will proposeâLet your State debt be afl'umedby
the United States.âln addition to the import and
excise, give them a dire<t tax.âLet this tax be
imposed on the (ingle article of improved land.
Three cents per acre, which is twopence curren
cy of New-England very nearly, will be fuffiei
ent to ertablifh the faith and justice of your coun
try, and content the public creditors, if theyare
reasonable men.âLet this be paid in the money
of thÂ« merchant, for if there be a depreciated
currency in circulation, you will eventually rue
the consequences.âEight tax-gatherers will be
fufficient to collect an excise and land tax in Con
necticut, which now employs one hundred.
Make these men responsible ; give them the sala
ry of eight hundred dollars per ann. and fuffer
no kind of fee robe taken from the people, This
will make a saving of nearly fourteen thousand
dollars, in the article of collection, which is prin
cipally paid by the poorest citizens ; and for which
they have no credit in the public opinion. The
planter, pofTefling one hundred acres in fair cul
tivation, will have to pay annually sixteen (hillings
New-England currency, for the whole amount
of his taxes, and without any additional fee to
collectors ; and those who have less estate in pro
portion. Every wife planter would compound
with the public for thisfumâl believe it would
be fufficient ; and I appeal to the honest cultiva
tors of the earth, whether it be more than one
third of the sum they have beenufed to pay.
My next number (hall contain further remarks
on a land tax.
