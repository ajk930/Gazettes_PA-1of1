Â«* Triflers not e'en in triflei can excell;"
THERE is no better way to eltimate the un
derftandlng of a man, than by hearing
him converse on what lie has discovered in his
travels. Many men, who adventure abroad, ne
ver get rid of their prejudices ; and whatever
falls within their notice, i 9 viewed under such an
eye of prepofl'eSlidn, that it eludes a fair exami
nation. A traveller of this call may add to the
number of his ideas, but he does not diminish his
errors, nor really add to his flock of truth. It
had been better for him, upon the whole, to have
tarried at home ; for he would then have spent
left money, and acquired fewer habits of vexing
his friends by his pertneft, or deluding them by
hismiftakes. If he attempts ro relate any inci
dent, he generally forgets the most material cir
cuwftances, and always gives it a falfe coloring,
or draws from it wrong inferences. We can,
however, bear with the mere errors that are im
posed on us by a traveller ; because, as we have
not the power of detecting the fallacy, we feel
no dilpofition to complain of the deception.
But there is a description of travellers whofc
conversation soon becomes irksome, if not intol
erable. I allude to tliofe frivolous characters,
whose minds are only occupied upon trifles ; and
who, wherever They go, or whatever they fee, car
never acquire or communicate theleaft degree oi
ufeful information. The habitual levity of de
portment, these triflers discover, soon renders
their mirth insipid, and their observations iiuinte
refting. There is no force of talents to invigorate
their remarks. If they afFed: tofhewwit, noper
fon perceives the edge of it ; and if they relate
anecdotes, it is impofiible to find the pith of theii
Story. In Short, a man of this trifling turn mufl
continue of that character, whether he travels 01
Stays at home. He can never arrive at excellence
even in tliofe habits, which peculiarly belong ta
him. Thetruth is, the more expert any one js,
in displaying frivolous aecomplilhments, thelefs
excellent does he appear. We can never aflo
ciate ahy idfcas of merit with qualifications that
produce no advantage, and indicate no capacity.
However ostentatious a man maybe, if he has not
folic! attainments, he is soon penetrated, and his
companions determine at once, that he does not
trifieforthe fake of being pleasant, but because
he does not know how to be serious, and can ne
ver be wife. Men of good sense and gravity some
times relax their uluai tone of demeanor, andean
ainufe themselves with trifles without being con
temptible. It can be perceived that the part they
have taken, is aflumed only for thcmoiiient. But
noted triflers so flagrantly deviate from dignity
of manners, that 110 person will mistrust, they act
from a character they have taken up, but from
one, they cannot lay aside.
My young acquaintance Garrulus has late
ly returned from his education and his travels.
His friends imagine he has made great improve
ments ; but he is much more indebted to their
partiality than ro his own acquirements, for the
eftiir>ation in which he is viewed. It was easily
supposed that so pert a boy mutt, if well-educated,
make a smart man. He early discovered Symptoms
of vanity, and these were mistaken for indica
tions of genius. Full offlattering hopes, his par
ents conceived the idea, that he mult be sent tc
Europe for an education. He has completed it
and once more resides in his native country, i
'wiil not pretend to fay, what he would havebeen
3iad he coMinucd at home ; but he has, by 110
means, loft his pertnefs or his vanity, by going
abroad. GarÃulus well remembers the tium
hers of years be has confiuned atfchools andtfni
â verfities, and has not yet forgot the names ofthe
authors he was compelled to read. It diverts
children and servants to hear him recount the tricks
and frolics of li*s academical life ; aYid 1 believe
thisisthe only am n feme lit, his education is cal
culated to aflrbrd. The reader w ill expert to be
entertained with ail account oft Tie travels of this
afpiringyouth. But here I find myfelf at a loi's
how to gratify such an expectation. Though I
am frequently in company with him; I have yet to
learn, whether he has gained one uses ul idea,from
traveling two years throngh the most celebrated
countries in Europe. He has often boasted to 111 c,
thaÂ£ ' ,e dined with fixyonngnoblemen, at an ho
tel in France ; complained that he found bad inns
in Italy ; and declared that he eat failed cabbage
111 Germany. But he fee 111s to dwell with peculiar
delight in relating how rapidly the stages drive
through England, and howcomplaifantly he was
treated athoufes of entertainment. He mentions
fucli cireumftances witlian air of triumph,becaufe
he alledges that in these respeCts, the English are,
beyond companion, superior to his own country
men. Nothingfills liim with more rapture, than
to bobble to point out any particular, in which
WEDNESDAY, December. 2, 1739.
the Americans have not arrived at equal perfec
tion with the Europeans. It happens fortunately
for us, that Cj.arrui.us has extended his obser
vations to nothing, of so much importance in it
felf, as to render it a point worth contending,
in which country it holds a pre-eminence.
These trifling characters, however, find easy
admillion into the belt circles of company, the
world affords. This may seem the more extraor
dinary, as a person of thisftamp so soon becomes
tedious in private conversation, where only a so
cial interview is intended; We can easily find a
folutiom to this diiliculty. A talkative, imperti
nent bo dy way be called a bon companion by all
men, th ough iio man views him with any refpedt
or friend/hip. There is a convenience in having
iuch an aflbciate. We feel free, and unembar
rafled in his presence, can learn front him the
news and fafhions of'the day, and fend meflages
by him to any part of the town. BÂ«t there is yet
a greater advantage, one findsin.fuch an acquain
tance : It is well known, that in mixed compan
ies, few people have a turn for general conversa
tion ; and uulefs some person is present, who has
agood {hare of impudent pra,ttle, there will be
too much dullness and reserve. Every modest
man of the party feels relieved, when any of his
companions will take his {hare of the conversa
tion. In this way, men of bold, afluming man
ners, how ever ignorant they may be,endear them
-I'clves, as companions, to all denominations of
society. I have observed that in rnoft clubs or
parties, fenfiblc men are fond of admitting fonie
persons 'of levity,merely tomakediverfion for the
reft oftlie company.
It is tobe regretted that some worthy youth are
beguile d into an opinion that impudence is de-
Arable, because it meets with attention. They
draw this conclufion.from the notice thatis taken
of fnch characters as I have been describing.â
Could ;it bedifcerned, from what motives, men of
a forward, ostentatious deportment are received
info company ; or cotild it be known in what light
they are generally estimated, they would no lon
ger be regarded as objedls of envy, or as patterns
for imitation. Every young manfhould conclude
with refpecft to liimfelf ; that, if his talents and
accomplifhinents are not so coufpicuous as to at
tract esteem and admiration tinfolicited, he can
never acquire any real influence of character by
pertnefs and felf importance. It is true he may
gain a uumerous acquaintance, but he will find
few friends : People wijl entertain him kindly ;
but they will place in him no confidence ; they
will trust him with no property. Upon the whole,
his life will be neither honorable to liimfelf, 1101
lerviceable to society. x
THE OBSERVER. No. VII.
The fiufltiating value of Paper in circulation oppres
sive to the poor.
E' VERY public measure, wliich fubjccls needy
i citizens to the imposition of the rich, is repug
nant tojuftice. Great numbers of the rich are alio
generous tothepoor, but it is not the character of
all to whom a wife Providence hath distributed
wealth. One rtutn of great opulence and a hard
heart h'ath power to oppress a whole vicinity of
needy people. Among the present means of oppref
fronin the United StateS, none is greater tliana cir
culating paper of unsteady and deceitful value;
and yet there are thole who with a confident face
will nflerr,' that the measures which lead to this
aredefigned as an easement to the necessitous mem
bers of society. Those who are poor and in back
ward circtini fiances unwarily are taken by the fait
pretences--they are told and believe that it is sot
their benefit, and bless the measures which sap the
vigor of their industry. The wealthy can make
their choice between several mediums in circula
tion, and if there be a bad kind of money, we
{hall always find it in the hands of those who have
least policy and riches : thus the indigent lie un
der a double disadvantage, the quantity of their
money is small, and it is of the Worst kind, not
being in demand to procure the neceflaries of
life. It is a maxim forever true that the worst
kind of circulating rttoney will in the end fall in
to the hands of those who are least able to bear
a loss. Those States which have partially funded
their debts pay the inrereft in paper certificates
or indents, which pnfs into circulation for the pay
ment of taxesâthese certificates are ifl'ued as an
equivalent for gold and silver coin, and in every
riew or the fadl they are a depreciated paper mo
ney, of very different value at several times of
the year and in different diftritfisâthey may be
purchased in large sums through uioft of the States
from one hundred to one hundred and fifty per
cent, discount. Taxes iflne by authority on the
fnppofition that it it is their real value, and it is
their real value to those who can purchase at the
right time of sale-; it is also their value to a greater
rFubliflied on JVedntfday and Saturday .j
part of the public creditors, whose diftrefled situ
ation obliges tliem to fell on any terms, the firll
moment they can obtain the interelfc from the pub
lic. Still it is fact that one half the taxable inha
bitants purchase them nearly at par with gold and
silver. The poor man and those of little enter
prife,l>ut industrious, delay purchasing untilfhejr
are driven by the hour of payment, and then make
the belt bargain they can, either with some neigh
bor, or public officer, prepared for the btnev'o/:nl
purpose of accommodating all such as could not
purchase in time for themielves. In this way pro
vision is made for this poor, and those whose cir
cumltances are decaying ; some of tliefe make pay
ment in hard labor, and some by promifory bonds,
induced by a snort credit they fall into the snare
and are effectually ruined.
Take the following fart as proof of my afTertion.
In Marcii, I 787, one hundred pounds fperfe was
lent to B jfton to purchase State paper, then re
ceivable 111 taxes, which paper was put into the
hands of a person in one of the weflern counties
of Maftachufetts, who returned the principal in
November of the fame year, with a net profit to
the owner of the hundred pounds, offixty pounds
fix /hillings and one penny. It is to be remember
ed this agent charged very high for his service and
expence3, so that it is certain, those who paid the
taxes, paid atleaft forty shillings for every twenty
which the State received. These were the very
people, who a little before had been scourged into
obedience by a'military force. For infurgertcy
they wfere criminal, and government was right to
check their phrenzy by the molt coercive means ;
but to palliate dieir conduct which we wish to bury
in oblivion let it be remembered that oppression
will sometimes make wife men mad. It is but a
few articles the pool planter has for sale, and
these perhaps not in demand at the rime neceflity
objiges him to fell, so that he can exchange them
only for the worst kind of circulating money, and
thAt at its highest price. The fame neceflity obliges
him to fell at the lowest price, and between buy
ing and felling, he makes a loss of one third. I
could mention athoufand wayx & depre
ciated circulating medium is opprefiive to man
kind, but especially to such as have small proper
ty ; and nature admits not of a poflibility of reme
dying the evil,but by wholly removing the cause.
No fac r ts can be more fully proved than those I
have mentioned, but there is foftrongapropenfity
in some people to have n cheap kind of money,
that tliev will think die writer hath mischievous
schemes in his brains, and that everything is en
dangered, until the parish Priest, or town peda
gogue, or the incendiary of the neighborhood,
foine of whom may chance to remember a phrafc
of school Latin, lliall have founded the alarm.
With wasps and flics the Observer promises great
patience, and will only drive them gently, 110 c
aiming at their life, for it is the nature of those
infects to buzz round the scent of liojiey, though
they can make none thcmfelves ; but ftiould any of
the higher da's of peculators, who have grown rich
on spoil, under the appearance of much honesty
and concern, unwisely throw themselves in his
way, he pledges himfelf to disclose things concer
ning thein, which the heart of the public hath not
conceivcd. The old man honest, he
made payment in the current money of the mer
chant, it is the money of the merchant which the
poor ought to receive, and 110 other kind of circu
lating medium will do justice in the community.
Whether this money be gold, silver or paper, it is
a matter of littleconfequence, for a fixed value and
general demand constitutes its worth. At present
11 is not poffiblefor the State governments to give
this ralueto their certificates or indents ,- but the
United States, if the whole debt could be brought
into one fund might easily effedl it by a connexion,
with the great mercantile banks within the Em
pire. Bank money is the money of the
and the whole commercial influence of the coun
try will preserve its value. Suppose the sums of a
rich and poor man's taxes to be apportioned accor
ding to their real wealth and ability ; the rich man
by purchasing the depreciated medium in proper
time and a small price, makes art easy payment;
the poor man purchasing at almost double price,
finds the demand intolerable ; and if to this there
be added fees for travel, and others which have no
legal name, he finks in ruin, These, ye poor and
embarrailed citizens, are the blessing of a cheap
paper money, for which too many of yoil have
been advocates. [,American Mercury.]

FRANCE.
NATIONAL ASSEMBLY, Sett. 26.
The National Aflembly having considered the
urgency of circum fiances, and read the report of
the Committee of Finance, accepts confidential
ly the plan proposed by thefirfl Minister of State.
Such was the decree 011 the Memorial of Monf.
Neckar, after a debate which lasted from nine in
the morning till half anhour past seven in the e
vening.
The Marquis de Montesquieu opened the de
bate by reading the plan of Adminiftratiori drawn
up by the Committee of Finance, in which were
proposed the following reductions:
Livres
The houfeliold of the King Queen and
Princes, 8,000,000
Foreign Department, 8,300,000
War ditto, . 8,900,000
Marine ditto, 2,000,000
Finance, do. x,000,000
Pensions, besides the reductions already
made, 6,000,000
Intendants and Delegates 1,800,000
Registers and Farmers General 2,600,000
Mint, 1,700,000
Premiums and encouragements to trade, 600,000
The Royal Gardens, 36,000
Library, 62,000
Stud (to be fupprefled) 800,000
Contingencies, 2,500,000
Fund reserved for Lotteries to be fup
prefled, x 73,000
Plantation of Forests, 817,000
Clergy,
2,502,000
Charities, 5,511,000
Livres 53,301,000
It next proposed to eftablifhtwo public banks,
one at the dii'pofal of the Executive power, with
*n annual receipt of 205 millions of livres, the a
mount of the National expenditure after the a -
bove reductions; the other, with an inalienable
revenue of 27? millions charged with the interest
of the National debt, and the expences of the pro
vinces, the former of which was ellimated at 240
millions, and the latter at 29.
Amotion was made to carryall the plate of the
churches to the mint, for the benefit of the public.
The Archbifliop of Paris immediateiy said, that
the Clergy, who had often succoured the State
in times of dish ess, were ltill ready to make the
greatest facrifices for the good of their country ;
and that they willingly give up all the Church
plate, only reserving as inuch as was neceflary for
diviue worlhip.
This patriotic proposal was received with gene
ral applause, but neceflarily gave place tothe main
quefiion.
M. de Mirabeati proposed an unqualified aflent
to the Minister's plan. As it was too extensive to
be difcufled in a short time, it was absolutely ne
cefiary to confide in the vvifdom of its author. If
it should fail, all Europe would exculpate the Na
tional Aflembly and the blame would fall on M.
Neckar âIf it should succeed, the merit and the
honor would be exclusively his.
This motion was carried, as stated above, by
405 voices, against 127.
In the evening, the decree refpcting the reve
nue was carrried, as drawn up by M. Anfon, with
foine amendments.
September 29.
A letter was read from the Jews, many of"whom
had been driven from Alsace into Switzerland,
and the President was directed to write to the mu
nicipality of Stralbourg, in the name of" the Af
fenibly, recommending them to the protection of
the Executive Power, as equally entitled to the
benefit of the law, with the relt of his Majesty's
fubjeifts.
PARIS, o<a. 14.
TO MORROW will be the last day of the Na
tional Allembly's fitting at Versailles ; they
are then to adjourn till Monday, when they will
meet in the great Hall of the Archbi/hop's Palace
in Paris, and continue their meeting there until
the new Hall in the Palace of" the TliuilJeries is
got ready.
The Aflembly will not in future have occasion
for so large a space, as near 300 Members are al
ready decamped, and many more only waiting an
opportunity to do the fame.
We have reason to believe that the majority
of the Members of the Aflembly were extremely
averfc to go to Paris, fearing their lives to be in
danger. But the repeated invitations of the Pa
risians, who would not be ealy them, at
length determined their removal, though not be
foie the Aflembly had received a formal Deputa
tiÂ°n from the Commons of Paris, who engaged
to anlvver for the perfoual feccirity ofevery Mem
ber.
1 he capital is again tolerably quiet, and things
goon nsufualâThe mob seems perfectly content
ed with the imprisonment of the Royal Family,
whose escape was so much theobjecft of their ap.
preheniions. Their Majeftieshad another levee
of the Foreign Ministers on Wednesday last, but
the King spoke but little, and looked desponding
and inelancholly. The Court was but thinly at
tended, and had much the appearance of a dumb
lhew.
1 he inoft particular circumstance which en
gages the public attention at the present moment
is the charge alledged by M.de Mirabeau, in the
National Aflembly against the Count deSt. Prielt
Minilter of State, with the answer of M. de St'
Prielt: to the charge.
This affair has made a great noise in the city
tor lome days pall, and the popular cry was of
courle considerably to the disadvantage of the
Mmifter, who accordingly has thought proper to
refute it in the most unequivocal terms, before
that the accusation was brought to the proof.
M. deSt. Priest's letter is addrefled to the Pre
sident of the Committee of the National Aflem
bly, to whom the charge was referred for inves
tigation. It is rather too long for an entire tran
"ation, but we fliall give all the material points
of it : r
Pre^ent the Comm ' tte ' of Enquiry.
I UNDERSTAND that the National Aflembly
has received a denunciation from the Count de
Mirabeau, which is exprefled in the following
terms : Â°
" A Minister, called the Count de St. Pi ieft,
laid on Monday last to the phalanx of women \vlio
demanded bread of him,âWhen you had but one
xin S> you had bread in plentyâNow you have
twelve hundred, âGo andafk it of them."
I think it my duty, Sir, not to wait for your
refearcbes, but to declare to you positively on my
honor, that the fa# alledged by M. de Mirabca'u
is maliciously invented ; nor have I furnifhed the
jnghtelt pretext for the aflertion. M. de Mira
beau does not fay he heard me, and I am willing
to believe that he has been deceived. I declare
011 my honor, that I only spoke to a few women
who entered dans I'xiLde BeuJ, (the King having
oideredme to gothei-eand hear their complaints,
and answer to them.) I believe there were an
hundred witnefles who heard my discourse, and
I doubt much whether one of them will affirm he
heaid me mention a single word about the Na
tional Aflembly.
To the complaints of these five or fix women,
for there were no more, I answered that the King
had done every thing in his power to procure grain
for the Kingdom and the Capital , that grain had
been brought from all parts of the world ; that
in short the care provisioning Paris had been
fov two months past under the management of the
city, to which the King and his Ministers, had
united all their endeavors. I do not recoiled:
that the conversation turned upon any other fub
jei^âbesides is it pollible tocall fiveorfix women
a phalanx.
\V ithout having the honor of being known to
M.de Mirabeau,or having spoken to him in mylife,
I ei thelefs hoped he would not have given ear
to so trivial a circumstance on such flight authori
ty, and only told by persons who a few days since
willied to excite the people against the National
Aflembly : I hope likewise my general conduct
will place me above such an imputation. I have
palled many years in the service of my country
and have labored for its Welfare a-id âi

and in the name of themselves and other perform
ers of that Theatre, made an offer of twenty-three
thou/and livres, to be paid into the Royal Trea

President thanked them in the name of the Aliem

honor to invite them within the bar, where the*

His Majesty in Conncil was this day pleased to

Many persons who have travelled in France,
and have never observed any other than white
cockades worn by the military, are at a loss to
know the reason why, on a recent occasion, the
soldiers aflumed black cockades to teftify theirre
turning loyalty. The reason is, black cockades
are properly the cockades of the Kingâas such
they were often worn, as old officers will remem
ber, in the time of Marshal Saxe.
Although neither the Madrid Gazette, norany
other periodical prints appearing in Spain, take
the least notice of the revolution in France, norits
conferences ; nevertheless, there are some very
interesting pamphlets in circulation, translated
into Spanish, concerning these great events, and
which are read with avidity and entliufiafmintlut
country.
The Emperor (on his firft return to Vienna,

church of St. Stephen's and was remarkably fer

THE BRABANTIAN TERRITORIES.
The celebrated Vandernoodt, the Dr. Frank
lin o'f Brabant, has been near aflaffination ! âFour
desperadoes, from Vienna, lately went to Breda
on this detestable expeditionâand one of them
011 entering Vandernoodt'sprefence fired a pistol
at him, which happily misled hiin. The miscre
ants escaped, though closely pursued.
A like attempt has been made 011 M. de Marino',
at his feat near BredaâHe had retired to this
place ever since the senior Counsellors, to which
body he belonged, were fupprefled. He was in
his garden, when a Marechauffee of AuftrianÃra
bant came suddenly behind him, seized a ipafl e >
andftruck him on the head.âHe was refcueil y

ACTS OF CELIBACY REPEALED. .
Among the reforms going forward in the

celibacy among the Clergy makes no incon 1
able noise on the Continent. â â¢ -
On some dignified Ecclesiastics remon ra
with the Emperor on this repeal, bis Maje 7wered them rather neatly : " Gentlemen, is it
then that you think the celibacy of the Clergy is
more advantageous to population than their mar
riages ?"âThe ecclefiaitics flirugged up their
Jhoulders, and complimented the Emperor on his
facetious raillery.
The Carron Manufactory in Scotland, is the

-Its weekly confuniption of coals amounts to

of each day is equal to that of the city of Edinburg,
durifig a whole week; As many coals are there
conluined in the Catron foundaries, as would

A thousand workmen are duly employed in this

MR. Pitt said the other day on opening

Tontine, and perhaps may search their Dictiona

The old lady who is now living and enjoying

Queen Anne's Tontine, has not yet been found.
Has any body ever seen this old lady ? Does any
body know this old lady ? Has any body seen the
man that saw the man that saw this old lady ?
The new Tontine, it is hoped, will have its ef
fect on the manners of the age, and encourge
temperance in eating and drinking, as the only
means of furvivorlhip. '
A Tontine is surely the most plealing way of
alking for a loan ; for every one lias the strong

true, which he ardently wifhesto be so, pleases
himfelf with the idea of long life, and rhus free

A O avoid the tyranny of lawless paflion,
The hazards of contempt and calumny*
The heats and hectics both of fear and love,
The qualms, and quarrels of a married life,
The cumbers, hummings 'bout a family:
To ride secure out of the reach of fortune,
O'erlooking all those roiling tides of fate,
Which a vain world is hurried with, and then
To be Wrapt up in innocence, a Devotee
Dear and familiat to the Deity ;
Is furelya condition to be caught at
With all th' expansion both,of mind and body:
But then again, to weigh the cancelling
Of what I'm born to, tugging all tny life
Against the tide ; still {training up the hill,
The plains and pit afant vallies ever hidden.
What is it less than the bold undertaking
Of a perpetual war with nature ? which how well
I may cbme off in, is to me unknown.
But does not nature in her genial pourfe,
Dcfign all creatures for their fixed end ?
Did the wife God of nature give me seX
Only to cast it off ?
Our paflions, our affections and desires
We are enjoin'd to regulateânot relinquish 1
Why were these obiefts lent us, set before
Our open eyes, and we forbid to view them ?
Our joys, our hopes, the feathers of the foul
Were never given to become our torment:
I cannot think so meanly of the Deity,
That it should fill our fails with pregnant gales,
And yet forbid us touch those pleasing coasts,
That we thereby are driven to.âAll spiritual is
Too fine for flefli to live by ; and too gross

So his affection's object must. Love temper'd right

Than he that is ty'd up to ftrift conditions ;

Than to miftrult his Grace, and out of fear
Lock up in forced chains my free-born foul.

" Ignorant old age, is the worfl picture that

HOW important is it to make provision inyouth
to alleviate the inevitable miieries of old
age ! that we may mitigate the sorrows of our de
clining years, by finding a substitute for tliofe va
cancies which time, accidents and death, will
make in our friends and enjoyments ! Though
we cannot fly from our fate, yet we can meliorate
its leverity. Nature in a thousand direifUons teach
es us the mod ufeful leflons of prudence, and fore
thought. We anticipate winter ; we provide for
its approach, and its inclemency is abated. The
difference between a wife man and a fool is, that
the latter lives to the moment; the former al
ways calculates for the confequeilces of events.
Providence hath llot pointed out any expedient
to relieve tis under the infirmities of age, equal
to knowledge, study and meditation. A taste foi
these must be acquired in youth; while the mind
is flexile and fufceptibleof impreflions, our stock
of ideas should be laid in. These will prove oui

desert us. With our books we can always find

which we have palled. Chearfulnefs is the off

the furrows of ageâlt attra&s the company, love,
and veneration of the youngâlt fmootlis the pil

to be dreaded ; for except its infirmities arc

BASTILE ANECDOTE.
THE DREAM BOOK.
TMIESE lingular volumes, we (inderftand have been preserved
1 jnd we hope to gratify the Curiosity of our readers by the
followiug authentic account of them.
It wasihe custom of the Lieutenant Governor, or rather, as we
believe he was called, the Major of the Baftile, not from any or
der of government, but as a curious whim of his own, to enquire
of any prisoner who was destined to liberty or death, On the
morning of the day of execution or deliverance, concerning the
dream of the preceding night. Whatever fancics had troubled
or sweetened the repofc of the prisoner, we may believe to have
been related with agitated fidelity, and the vtlion, whatever it
might have been, being noted down by the officer, he always
retired with great politeness, but never was known to commu
nicate whether the dream of the night was or w'as not ominous of
tiie event of the day.
The Gentleman who inflrufts us in this article, and from whom
w-lball receive further notifications concerning this horrid mÂ»n
tion, was once a trembling inhabitant of it.
On the day of his dclivcrance, but before he had received any
information concerning it, the Major of the Prison waited on
liijn a* he ocCalionally did, and after forae officialcoHvetfation dc
frred him to relate thedrea'.n of the preceding night.âThe ques
tion he thought foreboded something, and he was not in a situation
to fuppofethat it foreboded any good ; however, after some time
the dream enquired after was recolle&ed, and was as follows :
The prisoner dreamed that he was walking in a church yard ;
that the path lay round the church, which was a very large and
lofty Gothic building, and that a croud of persons of all age*
and both sexes, who appeared entirely unknown to him, were
taking the fame circuit with himfelf. On a sudden a large globe
of fire feeniedto be suspended over the church, and in a short time
the lead, melted by the prodigious heat, ran in streams from eve
ry part of the building, and as it it'll onrthe people beneath, it
instantly destroyed them. After some time a stream of the burn
ing metal fell upon him, but without doing him the least injury,
and he alone appeared to escape the horrid ruin that surrounded
him.
The Major wrote down miuuteS of this dream, rrturned the
prisoner thanks for his communication, and took h;s leaveâlt was
however, ominous of his deliverance, for in less than an hour he
was restored to liberty.

Amsterdam, Oct. 26, i7Sp.
SIR,
YOUR fifteenth qusere is, '' Did not the Etiglifh
army lay cut its pay in America ? At how much
can the yearly benefit he calculated ? Are not the
jrifoners provided for in America? Who has the
care of their maintenance .â¢* How was Burgoyne's ar
my supplied ?
WHEN the English army was in Boiton, they
bought all that they could, and left considerable
sums there in silver and gold. So they did at
Rhode-liland. Since they have been in New-
York, they have purchased every thing they could
of provisions and fuel, on Long-Island, Staten-
Island, New-York-Island, and in those parts of the
States of New-York, and New-Jersey, where
they have been able to carry on any clandestine
traffic. When they were in Philadelphia, they
did thefame ; and Gen. Howe tells you, that he
fufpetfs that Gen. Washington, from political
motives, connived at the people's supplying Phi
ladelphia, in order essentially to serve his coun
try, by inlinuating into it large fumsof silver and
gold. They are doing the fame now, more or
less, in South Carolina and Georgia; and they
cannot go into any part of America without do
ing the lame.
The British prisoners, in the hands of the Ame
ricans, receive their cloathing chiefly from the
English; and flags of truce are permitted to come
out from their lines for this purpose. They re
ceive their pay also from their mailer ; and spend
the mol> of it where they are ; they also purchase
provisions in the country, and pay for it in hard
money.
I am not able to ascertain exatftly the yearly be
nefit ; but it mull be considerable: And the addi
tion now of a French fleet, and army 10 supply,
will lyake a great addition of calli and bills of
exchange, which will facilitate commerce and
privateering. And the more troops and ships
Great Britain and France fend to America, the
greater will this refonrce neceliarily be to the A
mericans. I have the honor to be, &c.

From the HERALD ok FREEDOM.
MR. PRIVTER,
I WAS highly gratified bytliefhort observations
of your con efpondent Agricola, in the He
rald of Tuesday last. He difcovercd in his ad
drefsto the" wife," so candid and good a temper,
so much real judgment, and such a zeal for the
liberty of my country, that 1 long to know him,
that I may thank him. I must, however, content
ruyfelf with exprefung, in this manner, my gra
titude to him, and my cordial agreement in his
sentiments. Ido not generally approve of con
demning whole profellions of men at once, or
determining upon the motive by which they are
governed, but these clergymen are fair game,
and are not entitled to the common rights or
charily of mankind. Much has been said of their
good behaviour during the revolution, but your
correspondent has found a motive which at once
f weeps off all their merit in this affair, and frees
lis from the obligations which some fooliih people
supposed we were under to them 011 this account.
Certain it is that they cannot be friends to freedom,
because they pray again(l anarchy; nor can they
truly love liberty, because they are averse tolicen
tioufnefs ! They have proved that they are not
genuine whigs, in your correfponilont's sense
and mine, for they were, to a man almost, united
againit that high and glorious friend to liberty,
Gen.ghays ; and what is far worse, they appear
ed as unanimously to approve of our new ieileral
conilitution, which deitroys the liberty of paper
money and tender ac r ts forever, and will prevent
that anarchy, without which your correspondent
and 1 shall never beno'.iced or honored. Thev
have also had the confidence to discover a great
affection and regard for President Washington,
who, notwirhitanding his pretended zeal for li
berty during the revolution, appears to have as
great an aversion to " licendouftiefs and anar
chy," as these black coated gentry, by which
means he has loit his merit with your correspond
ent and myfelf, and all others like minded.
If there had been proper gtiards against the
opprefuons of our rulers and to preserve the con
fetjuence of the people, established by our con
stitutions, I should not have joined so fully with
Agricola in his brilliant observations, but every
body knows that our rulers pofiefs absolute pow
er :âThat the people cannot turn them out of
places, nor eletft others in theit room, and
that our great men have been remarkable for acft
ing directly contrary to the sense and will of their
constituents for many years part. Our govern
ment is so far from being democratical, that we
are in the utiPcft danger from monarchy anddef
potifm, and every' man ought to do all he can to
weaken the force of and increase the
consequence of the peoj~*l e -
I am also gratified to fine? that your good cor
respondent is cautioning the public against the
encroachments of tliefe iniiiifters, for if we cio
not soon take the alarm, they will loon overrun
and enslave us. They are, Mr. Printer, so very
rich; they have such nionltrous overgrown liv
ings,that they will soon be able to buy out all the
country ; and then they are so independent too !
Everybody knows that they aie under no re
straint or controul from a fear of incuringthe
displeasure of their hearers. They cannot be
removed from their places, nor puniflied if they
do amiss, but amidst their pomp, their power and
their riches, they bid defiance to all around them.
I cordially hope that my friend Agricola will
continue his humorous publications, until our li.
berty shall be thoroughly eltablilhed, and we shall
be no more troubled either witli religion or go
vernment. IRONICUS.

one day, in order to procure a pair of second-handed brufli
es, for the purpose of cleaning his shoes ; at which the matter of
the (hop presented him with a .couple, which were become unfit
for his own use. " What is your price," fays the Judge: "If
they will answer your purpose," replies the other*, you rnay have

ready to purrhafe : but ev^r since it has fallen to my lot to occupy
a feat on the bench, I have Itudioufly avoided receiving a single
copper, by way of donation, left in some future period ot
it might have f(Mie kind of influence in determiningmy judgment-
