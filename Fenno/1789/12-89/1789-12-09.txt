THE TABLE T. No. LXIX.
" Experience is of greater use, in procuring good lazoi, than genius."
AS no human affairs require more knowledge than the art of
governing, it is not to be wondered at, that so few able le
â¢â iflatori have exilled in any age or country. The moll ufeful at
tainments in the science of government mull be founded on fact
and observation. This coniiitutes the difficulty of the talk. No
man, who does not possess good talents, can gain wisdom by ex
perience ; and many men, whose talents are eminent, feel a pride
of genius,that makes them dildain lo watch experiments. Ittherc
forc happens that those people, who have not the sagacity to make
iuft observation? for themselves, are fiaves to imitation, and are
perpetually liable to err in their application ot borrowed rules
and precedents : While thofe,on the other hand, who depend on
the light of genius to dirtft their operations, are seduced into wild,
impracticable measures. Thus it appears that thereare two four
ccs of illulion and mistake, into which moll men plungej whoen
ter a career of political life;
One of them c.mfiftst in originating fchemcs, or conceiving the
ories, not warranted byexpeiience ; and the other, in being I'way
ed by too complying a temper of imita! ion. No man Ihould im
plicitly imitate another in his conduct ; because, every man is
often actuated by motives, which others do not feci ; and attended
bv circumstances, which others do not observe. Nor Ihould any
irian be totally inattentive to the conduit of others ; bccaufe there
are many common points, in which all men Ihould think and ast
alike 4 and in which, the experience of one man may be profita
ble to all other men. To determine in what cases imitation is
proper, requires a dif-ernmcnl which few men possess. Exper
ience is the only fafe criterion by which to try opinions or actions.
Abftraft reasoning may be ufelul, but it often produces conclusions
which experiment will not authorize. Though it mull be con-
that every person should be governed by some fixed princi
ples, and ast in a great degree under the controulof some system ;
vet those principles, and this system, mull he the effect ol exper
ience, rather than theory or imitation. Men of a bold, afpn ing
genius, form their fyllctns too soon and too rashly ; and servile
imitators never form any fyllems at all. But a person, who has
capacity enough to derive profit from his experience, will in food
i'eafon form his rules of conduct ; and he can also determine when
circumftanees require an alteration.
From these flight (ketches, it is evident that the formation of a
good government is a flow, progrcflivc work. Theoretic men may
build fyllems of their own ; men fond of imitation may look
abroad for inllruftion, and perhaps neither con, in the tirft in
fiance hit the true points of legislative wisdom. The wisest law's
and regulations are generally owing to an experiment lefultmg
from the operation of those ordinances, that were originally fra
med with laultsand defects. Hie people ofthe United States have
gone through the firll llagcs of then difficulties. They have com
mitted many errors, which have proved a valuable source of ex
perience. But we ihould not yet suppose ourselves perfect in the
art of government. Many important objects of legiftation are yet
untried and unexplored. In tome of these, we may readily adopt
proper expedients ; but we mud dependon a courle ot experience
to carry us forward to perfection. In this view i.f the fubjeft, it
will occur to sveiy reflecting mind, that candor and patience
Ihould be cultivated among our citizens; and that our rulers Ihould
contemplate', that they Hand on new and critical ground. Their
mod illustrious talents; their roofl persevering indullry ; their
most acute arid attentive observation will not be more than com
petent to the taflc they have to accomplilh. It in this arduous
filiation, they have to contend with any great degree of clamor
and impatience among their cohftituents, tliey will find an addi
tional difficulty in furmountitig the obstacles, that inevitably at
tend ler-iflating over so vail and various a people.
A o-entleman having favored us with a Charles
ton "paper of Nov. 12, it is with great pleasure
that we prelent our readers with the following
excellent, patriotic, and truly federal Addrels:
The Hon. Judge CHARGF. to the
GRAND JURY, Oader SeJJio/u, 1789.
gentlemen,
THE grand inquest of this diltrid; has been of
late years so nnaccurtomcd to receive any
charge from the magiltrate prcfidingin this court,
that were I to prxtermit the ceremony or duty
of addrelling you, it could not be considered as
an innovation introduced in the prefentterm.
The chief reason which renders a charge to a
grand jury neceflary or requisite is, that they
maybe more fttlly inltrutfted 111 the duties of their
office, and be familiarized with the of
proceeding to execute those duties ; that tney
may not only be enabled confeientioufly, as well
as legally, to form a just opinion of the nature of
the clinics with which offenders fhallbe charged,
but also ofthc legality of evidence which may be
produced before them : In fine that they may
have every opportunity of doing justice to theii
country and fellow citizens, by having explain
ed to them how they may bring the guilty to con
dign pnnifhment, and discharge the innocent
from the apprehensions of a public trial. Hence
the result of fucli information would be, a legal
verdict. But-as the practice of these principles
and this procefsare so lrequently Submitted to a
jury of this diftritff, this part of the duty of the
judges in the court of general sessions becomes
in some degree lets urgent and neceflary, than in
the more dillant tribunals ; the common and re
ciprocal intercourse of mankind with each otnci,
furniflies them with more ample and frequent
means of obtaining information ; teache; them
to weiph with caution and candor lubjecfts lub
mitted to their difculfion, and leads them "J'"''"
luntarily through apparent intricacies and subtle
refinements, to decilions formed 011 the ba.ia of
truth, juitice and impartiality. Such is the Ittu
ation of the inhabitants of this diftrtv't and
fll rely it is an advantage which they will ever con
tinue jealous of maintaining, whillt iheflame o
liberty burns with purity, and with
its lately acquired vigor and brilliancy, .o. as
WEDNESDAY, December I'Sg.
knowledge is the distinguishing criterion between
man and the subservient brute creation, so is free
dom the genuine charadleriftic of that part of
mankind, who from their superior intelligence
and more adtive and daring spirit have not fear
ed the resentment of tyrants, but rifqueing their
wealth and their lives have intrepidly encounter
ed a thoxifad difficulties to obtain the object of
their admiration. In this partial view of mankind,
the mind is pleafet! with its reflexions, and the
heartjanimatedby itsfenfations. But when wecon
iider but for a moment, how few nations are pof
fefled of this idol, how do our feelings changing,
recoil upon us, and how do our fympatliy and
joy alternately excite commiseration and grateful
sentiments. For what earthly transport can ex
ceed the state of an independent freemanâwhat
sublunary misery equal to the wrenched existence
of the Have.
But let us hope that as we have been recom
pencedby the almighty decrees of Heaven in ref
cuingus from our tyrants, that the example of
our success will lead other nations to imitate lb
glorious an enterprise, to aflert their just rights
as men, and to unfetter themselves from the
bondage with which they have been so long op
prefied. Nevertheless in the height of our zeal
for the rights of mankind,and amidftourfincerell
wiflies for the general consummation of then
welfare and liappinefs, we muil not forget thetri
bute so juftlydue for our deliverance, or neglect
the improvement of our own affairs. Whene
ver THE HANDOfOMNIPOTENCE SHALL DEICN
to point out a WASHINGTON among their
NATIONS, THE DIVINITY WILL NOT PROVE UN
FAVORABLE TO THEIR PRATEKS OR TO HIS EX
ERTIONS*
Let our hearts then, in the firft place, never
cease to direct our thanksgivings to the throne of
that Grace which has illustrated our nation by such
unexampled beneficence ; andlet thegrateful ac
knowledgments of our just remembrance of past
services perpetuate theunblemilhed honors of oar
chofenhero. The confidence of the people of A
merica, instead of the jealousy and dijtrujl inci
dent to the various European forms of govern
ment ; and truth instead of that flattery, lhall
weave a wreath of heartfelt fatisfa<tion for him ;
and gratitude instead of the boajied loyalty of the
subjects of princes, and their blind fubmiffian to the
will of a superior, fliall ereÂ«t in the hearts of the
citizens of the United States, the most honorable
monument that ever graced the memory of man.
This elogium of our great and good commander,
has been long iinprelled upon our minds ; and
time but serves to encreafe our admiration of
his excellent qualities, and to supply us with ad
ditional motives of gratitude for his disinterest
ed and patriotic conduct.
Our next care, gentlemen of the grand jury,
will be to watch the motions of our internal ene
mies, to anticipate their various intrigues, and to
disappoint thofefecret combinations, into which
they nmy have entered. It may perhaps, be mat
ter of curious enquiry, though of tinf'atisfactory
inference, to conlider the motives of many of the
objectors to the new constitution ; but this would
lead me into a difcullion too prolix for the pre
sent moment. I will content myfelf, therefore,
with barely enumerating a few of tliefe causes.
Some men feared the loling of that influence,
they had assumed and established to them!el\es,
under the weak and divided governments of the
several States ; some again apprehended that they
would be deprived of the benefits and emolu
ments of certain lucrative offices, which they
held under the refpe<ftive legillatuies of then
country ; the appointments ol which were to be
resigned into the hands of the President of the
Union: A wifh,perhaps, to involve this coilntry
in foine dellructive resolution, might influence
others ; for to men of no property, ortotliofe
who are so embari affecl in their circumstances, as
to hope for no relief from their own labor, or the
arts of peace, or who are tormented with a un
contented factious heart, rebellion and confufion
would yield a rich liarveft : For the honor of the
human race, I hope, there are but few, it any
such among us ; but such have been found in o
thcr nations, and we mult not flatter ouiicHcs
that mankind are more perfect in our time, than
they have been heretofore :âAn obflinate fu
perciliousfelf-fufliciency, (therefult of the want
of proper information and candid enquiry) and
a capricious ostentatious vanity of not thinking
like other people, will have its weight and influ
ence with weak minds.âPopularity also has en
creafed its votaries, and afforded men one more
opportunity of declaiming on the danger in
which the liberty of the citizen is likely to be
involved, and of exhibiting their attachment to
this ideal idolatry Nor has jealousy, which
rankles in the hearts of ethers, had less effctt in
\_PubliJbei? on IV edmfday and Saturday A
diff'ufing thispoifon ; for it is observable through
out the whole of the United States, a majority
of the leaders of the oppofitiou of our newly
adopted government, are not natives of our foil ;
hence this pernicious quality of the mind dilplays
itfelf more widely in America ; for doubtlels
there are many among us, who being mere adven
turers, and meaning to return to their native
country, cannot bi-oolc that a rival nation should
bepofiefled of advantages superior to their own :
but, gentlemen, there is another fort of jealou
sy that agitates the foul of others ; I speak of that
mean invidious quality, of its own
demerits and want of worth, endeavors to estab
lish itfelf a character by calumniating the conduce
of others, and by finding fault with what it was
not consulted to "frame : we inaft also expect to
find emiflaries amongst us,who will seek to obtain a
temporary favor of the peoj>le, and who by court
ing and adulatingâtheir weaknesses, will ensure
to themselves frequent opportunities of sowing
discontent and sedition among our inhabitants.
There is,gentlemen,one rank of persons unfriend
ly to the present views of America, who deserve
our real esteem tho we are adversaries in opinion.
I mean those well intentionedingenious citizens,
who arc actuated by the purest motivesâthe real
love of their country, and its freedom. Jull es
caped from the galling manacles of one tyrant,
they are, perhaps, too overweeningly zealous in
their opposition. But the bed of men will differ
with thechafteft intentions. Let us therefore do
justice to their passionate ardor in the cause of li
bertyâanddifcriininate the licentious intemper
ance of a party, from the jealous integrity of a
true republican. For if men have never been a
ble to agree upon the great and solemn truths rev-
Vealed to us in thÂ£ Chriflian dispensation, what
flattering hope can we fofter in our bosoms, that
we fhoulcl be all reconciled in one political pro
blem. Vain hope! Wliilft men are poflelied of
different views of interestâon ambitious aggran
dizement, are actuated by other principles
those of honor or philanthropyâand are encum
bered with the frailnefs of humanity, it would be
foreign to, and inconsistent with our natures, to
expert a concurrence cis sentiment. But as the
noblest religion ever profefled in this world by
mankind, has thriven, and established itfelf under
the intolerant fpiritof its opponents, let us hope
that the work (which future ages, I doubt not, will
honor as the niafter-piece of political wisdom)
shall thrive also under the auspices and modera
tion of its present champions, and the perfecutioii
ofits enemies. The learned and ingenious author
of the Federalist, gentlemen, justly observes :ââ¢
" That a dangerous ambition oftener lurks be
" hind the fpeciousmafk of zeal for the rights of
" the people, than under the forbidding appear
" ance of enthusiasm for the firmnefs and cffi
" cicncy of government. History will teach us
" that the former has been found a much more
" certain road to the introduction of defpotlfin,
" than the latterâand that of those men who
" have overturned the liberties of republics, the?
'< greatest number have begun their career, by
" paying an obsequious court to the peopleâcom
" mencing demagogues, and ending tyrants."â
Since, therefore, there are so many evil and mis
chievous principles meditating against us, and but
one which is truly honorable, how much ought
we to be upon our guard to disappoint or resist a
secret adversary. It is said, that a fettled train
of correspondence was very early established in
this bufmefs, and that it still continues to flowun
interruptibly from its impure source. When fucli
means are adopted, where shall we find wisdom
enough to detect, and prudence fufficient to de
fend us from its evil machinations. Let us, how
ever exert ourselves, trusting that Providence ne
ver will abandon those, whom it has been pleased
to divert from the crooked paths of speculation,
private dishonor, and national infamy, into the
highroad leading to dignity, virtue,and honor ;
aud that this will bo the consequence of our hav
ing happily adopted the Conftitufion, and of our
continuing to persevere (I hope fuccefsfully) to
maintain it unsullied and unimpaired, against the
struggle of our opponents, I could easily de
monltrate to you. This will probably be the sub
ject of another charge, and at a future day. For
the present I will quit this topic, which is so tru
ly dear and intereftingto us allâl mean the wel
fare of our countryâand apologizing for having
withdrawn fomuch of your time from the parti
cular official duties of the station you now appear
in, I will proceed briefly to lay before you some
of the more general principles which must guide
your present decisions.
[Having pointed out as usual the common du
ties of the grand jury, he proceeded as follows.]
At the fame time that you are empowered to
examine witnefles against theprifoner, and nonetor hi in, I mil ft inculcate upon you tlie proprie
ty, and neceihty of your lilleningto no otherfort
ot evidence than that which isdelivered to you by
Perfonstnyourprefnce. Hard indeed is the me
thod oi trial before your tribunal, difguftiuo- iâ
ome meaiure to your minds and contrary to the
rules of law m other courts; where no decision
is made, no verdict formed, until the tellimony
ot both parties has been submitted tothofe fitting
in judgement. But if you were to attend to writ
ten evidence, it would be placing tliole criminated,
111 a Jiruation infinitely more harsh, and would fa
vor ot a kind of persecution unknown to the free
men ot this country j for no man shall be charged
or convicted ot having committed any crime or
odence, without having those who accuse 'him
brought face to face. The fubttitution therefore
ot written evidence instead of personal tellimony,
v\ ou 1 1i ,>e an innovation of dangerous tendency
and might be made the legal tool of oppression to
the citizen when it can be in no wife jollified by
policy or neceihty. Should a man be found auilty
before you of any offence whatever, upon this
and Â° ; teflunony, you brand him with a
which perhaps he may never have an opportunity
of wiping olf. For fliould not his accusers ap
pear before the petit jury at his trial, there is no
method of acquittal for him from the clvirae
which our law points out. True it is the coim
will discharge him; bnt how will he come forth
to his lellow-citizens ? Marked as a b a fe flagitious
character ; and as one who only escaped the pun
ifhnient he justly merited for "his crimes, by the
nt r. or perhaps misfortune of his accuser.
i nici, uon this, gentlemen, to you, because it is
propci you should be well informed upon a point so
favorable to an impartial trial; and it is with the
yjre confidence that I have dwelt so long on thisi
dea, because the judges rtf the court are unanimous.
V 01 tno opinion I have now given you. Perhaps
it would be 1 ufÃcient that I fliould add no other
reason than what I have dready submitted to
your consideration. But it is also a maxim a
dopted by one of the bell authors who has writ
ten on the criminal law, that a prisoner has
a right to challenge a grand juror. This, it
is true, has not been recognized by the prac
tice of this court, but I contefs I fliould feel in
clined, if a prifoger should object to one of you,
to upho ,! the objection, and support the prifon
ei s right to challenge ; More innovations have
crept into the proceedings of your body than this
alone ; foi formerly the evidence for the prisoner
as well as againfl him, used to be heard by you!
But this has been discontinued, and thebenefitof
it, I fear, irretrievably lolt to the unfortunate pri
soners. Precedents increafeprecedents; and in
novations multiply innovations. Theruleoflaw
gentlemen in this cafe is very clear, and has lon.'
been underftoodby profeflional men in the man"
ner I have now explained it to you.
. Let us not then permit a doctrine offo alarm
ing a nature, as that of written evidence, tobea
ilopted by us in our criminal courts. If, there
fore, there should be any written documents, ot
the guilt of tiiofe vvhoareto be tried, the
papers and indictments delivered to youÂ° you
will repudiate them as nfehfs and difgraceful to
your tribunal, unless the court should authoriCe you
to proceed thereon. For although it is laid down in
some very good authorities, that written evidence
may be read in cafe of the death of a witness I
doubt whether it would be luffered to be done in
a criminal cause, affeding the life, or even the cha
racter, oj a jeltovi creature. There is, gentlemen
one aa of the Ajfemlly of this State, entitled, << An
atl for the better ordering and governing of negr o ,s
and other Jlaves pafed the 10 th day of May, | 74 0
which is especially directed to be given you in
charge : and although the reasons may not exill
at present, which made it neceflkry at that time
yet, in obedience to the law of my country I mull
remind you of it. I hope, therefore, that you
v-,,1 gl ve it an attentive perusal, and if tliere
fliould appear to you any defects in the policy of
it; or that the law is too harsh and severe upon
that unfortunate race of mankind, that vou will
loft en off its rigorous effects; and that'vou will
shew to the world, that having obtained your own
liberty, yju well know how to prize it, and that
you arc truly fenhble how dear it is to mankind
by extending to the coloured people in our State
as much indulgence as tlieir unhappy fubordi.

N Monday ihormng the general alarm ofthe
people as to tbe intentions of the Court and
a ftarcny of bread, brought on a gradual infur
recftion m every yuartei- of Paris. The women
particularly, flocked in the most riotous manner
to the place de Louis XlVâthey were armed
with stronger weapons than they could wield, and
as they advanced, prefied every woman they met
with in to their service.
The Marquis de la Fayerte and Monf. Baillie,
the Mayor, spent the morning in a fort of detrac
tion, as to themeafures they ffiould pursue. The
troops determined for them, and particularly the
Gardes Francoises, who infilled 011 the Marquis
heading them to Versailles, or taking the alter
native of the lantcrne. A fufficient guard was
then oidered fortlie defence oftliecityâthe relt
of the troops, about 20,000 âabout 10,000 of the
armed Burgeois, who had before offered to be a
part of the militia, and as many of the dreadful
1110b of July as could join them, armed with pitch
01 vs, <cytlies, hooks, and iron in all fliapes, on
clubs of all sizes, intermixed with women, who
appeared more savage than the men, in all, a
mounting from 40,000 to 69000 people, marched
Â°J" ort ' ei ' w 'th drums aud colours, for
V erfailles, where they arrived about half pall
nine at night. But the women, who had aflem
bled 111 the morning, had reached Versailles many
hours before them, and aflilled by some of the
Versailles inhabitants, had stormed the Palace
Gates, called for bread, and infilled on the Life
Guards taking the National Cockade.
The whole Royal Family began to be alarmed
for their personal fafety. The Life Guard fired
011 the women, who became furious, and, assisted
as they were, victorious. Five young Noblemen
were immediately facrificed to their vengeance
one run thro the bodyâone hungâa third cut to
piecesâand two beheaded. The Marquis de la
Fayette came 111 time to save the lives of about
twenty others.
Tuesday morning many of the mob returned
from v erfailles. The heads of the two officers of
the Gardesdu Corps were borneon pikes through
le flreets of Paris ; and couriers, who had ta
ken the firft liorfes they could find, announced
the approach of the whole Royal Family. The
troops that preceded them, began to enter Paris
abunt two o clock, and the line was so extended
with women and club-men, that it was half pail
seven when their Majellies arrived at the Hotel de
llle. y,\ hat parted there has not transpired :
1 hey fleptm the appartments at the Thuilleries
and are to remain there.
The Flemish regiment was divided amon* the
troops, about twenty of the Gardes du Corps" the
King's household, &c. â 
About ten at night, proclamations appeared to
arture the people, that his Majefly had reeeived
the pan hans with great kindness ; that the Gardes
du Corps had taken the oath of fidelitvâhad a
greed to serve as the other officers, and to be af
hfted by other officers in their attendance on the
Court . and that his Majefly had signed the arti

proposes to seize upon the goods of the clergy,

THE KING'S PROCLAMATION.
THE King has ifliied a proclamation, Anting
forth, that left the faithful inhabitants of his pro
vinces should hear with concern the circumstances
that have induced him to take up his refidenceat
I aris,lie had thought it his duty to make known to
them, that being informed of the inarch of the
national militia from Paris, and their definngto
obtain the honor offerving as his guard, it would
have been easy for him to go to any other pl* cf
than Paris ; but fearing that such a resolution
might be t lie cause of much trouble, and confidinfin the sentiments which he had a right to cxpetf
from all his fubjecTts without distinction, he had
come to reside in Paris, where he received the
molt refpedtful testimonies of love and fidelity
from the inhabitants of that good city. That he
is certain they will never attempt, in any man
ner, to influence the free determination of their
sovereign ; and, from the midst of them, announ
ces to all the inhabitants of his provinces that
when the National Afl'embly fliall have terminated
the grand work of restoring the public welfare,
he will put in execution apian, which he has long
fnice formed of vifitingall his provinces to inquire
what good he can do in each, and to prove that
they were all equally dear to him. That he flatters
himfelf this declaration, on his part, will engage
all the inhabitants of his provinces to second the
labors of the National Affeinbly, in order that
France, under the protection of a happy conlli
tution, may enjoy that peace and tranquility, of
which an unhappy divifionhas long deprived it.
This proclamation is dated October 9, and un
der signed DE SAINT PRIEST.
Paris (o<ft. 16th) was again tolerably quiet, and
things went on as usual ; the mob feemecl perfect
ly contented with the ficuation of the royal fami
ly, whose el'cape was so much the object of their
apprehensions. Their Majesties had another le
vee of the foreign ininifters on Wednesday lalF,
but the King spoke but little, and looked despond
ing and melancholly. The court was but thin
ly attended, and had much ihe appearance of a
dumb flievv.
In the affray at Versailles on the 6th of October,
about jo of the Parisian troops and mob were kill
ed, and 80 of the King's guards cut to pieces.
The maflacre would have been much more terri-'
ble, had it not been for his majelly's orders.

Landing broke up ; they frequently wait in a
body on Governor ZESPEDIES, who entertains
them at his own house, and fuffers 110 one except
an Interpreter to be prefent;âit is whispered that
the real'on of M'Gillivray's not entering into a
treaty with the Commissioners was, that the terms
offered by Congress, would, (if accepted of) in
fringe on the treaty existing between his Catholic
Majesty, and the Creek nation ; that such a treaty
exilts is beyond all doubt, for the Kingof Spain,
ever iince the recovery of the Floridas, had paid
an annual tribute of 8000 dollars to the Indians
bordering on the Provinces ; they are regularly
supplied with cloatliing, arms, and ammunition,
out of the King's Magazine here and in Penfacola.
" Trifling as this present affair may appear to
some, I can afl'ure you, from my own observati

the Indiansâthe extent and situation of riieir
country,âthe weak state of our Southern Fron

" That the next step Congress takes in the busi

" 1 have the greatest reverence and opinion of
the wisdom of our leaders, but am apt to think

Of war, and death, and love : The simple maid,

Then fly beyond the bourne of mortal ken,
And study when he'd exhauft*d men.

Our accounts froiji Franee areinveloped in un

ed majority of the people in favor of the Nation
al Aflembly, yet it is evident that a great spirit
as fermentation is in existence among them.â
Fraud, ambition and wealth, have too often prov
ed equal to defeating the best devised plans in
favor of liberty and justice. Neither too much, nsr
(oo little, should be the motto of patriotism : This
will point out the golden moment of making sure
the glory, profperity,andhappinefsof a country.
Danger to the liberties of the people, in all re
volutions, arifesfrom the natural pride of the hu
man heart. It has too often occurred, to escape
the notice of the molt cursory observer, that vio
lent partizans are generally impatient of con
troul: This is the firft lyniptom of a despotic tem
per, aiid commonly appears after a series of
wheedling arts, have imposed on the judgements
of the people, and insured an ascendency in their
confidence. By degrees, the weight of party is
ascertained, and from that moment the voice of
reason, prudence and common sense are despised,
and every demand is made with an arbitrary tone ;
justice, honor, and personal rights are facrificed
for the good of the people, pretendedly ; but, in
reality, the establishment of power in the hands
of a majority, who are moulded, controuled and
directed by a demagogue, is the prime obje<fl.
It is too much the cafe that in contemplating
the rights of mankind at large, those of indivi
duals are often considered as grievancesâhence
those who are diftinguiihed by pre-eminence, are
viewed with a jealous and envious eye : In all
revolutions, attention to certain diftiuCtions, ap

NEW-YORK, DECEMBER 9.
A gentleman f/om Marietta, who left this city \ejlerday, on his way
to the Editor with the follotoing account:
About eight weeks fine:-, two brothers, by the name of JohnlWn,
one 12, the other 9 years oid, were playing ort the western bank,
of Short Creek, about twelve miles fron/Wheelinz, flapping stones
in the waterâAta dillanccthey discovered two men, whoappear
ed to be settlers, beingdreffed withcoatsand hats : Thefemen, to
amuse and deceive the children (as the event shewed) engaged in
the lame sport, advancing towards the boys, till by degrees they
got so near, that the children discovered them to be indians ) but
it was then too late to make their escape : The indians seized and
carried them fix miles into the woods, where they made a fire, and
took up their lodging for the night; their rifles ar.d tomahawks
they rested against a tree,and then laid down,each indian with a boy
onhis arm : The children as may befuppofed kept awakeâthe oldest
began to move, and finding his indian found a deep, by degrees,
difengagea himfelf, and went to the hre, which had then got low,
and (lined it up ; the indian not waking, be whispered to his bro
ther, who likewise crepi away, and both of them went to the fire_
The oldest boy then observed tohis brother, "I think we can kill
ihefe indians, and get away from them"âthe agreed it*
the propoldl of attempting it : The oldest then took one of the
rifles, and placed the muzzle, which he rested on a small stick.that
he found for the purpole, close to the head of one of the indians,
and committing the exceution of this part of the business tohis:
brother, ordered him to pull trigger at the moment he saw him
strike the other indian with one of the tomahawks : The oldeit
gave thefignaj; the youngest pulled triggerâthe rifle fliot away
the lowei part of the Indian'siace, and left him senseless ; he then
told his brother to lay on, for he had done for his ; after which he
lnatched up the gun and ran ; the boy with the tomahawk gave the
stroke with the wrong end, the india'n ftartcd on his feat the boy
found the mistake, and turning the tomahawk in his hand, gave
him another blow, which brought him to the ground ; he repeat
ed his ftiokes till he had difpatchcd him, and then made the belt
of his way after his brother. When the boys had found the path
which they recolleÂ£tcd to have travelled before, the oldest fixci
his hat on a bush, as a dire&ory to find the fceneof action the next
day. The tomahawked indian was found near the place where
the boys had left him : The other was not there j but was track'd
by his blood, and altho so weakened by his wounds, that he could
not raise his rifle to fire at his pursuers (two men) they fuffered
himto escape ; but it is supposed he mull have died of his wounds.
These two mdians were fentoutto reconnoitre the belt place for an
attack, which was to have been made by a body of warriors,
waiting in the neighborhood. The gentleman who gives this
account, saw, and conversed with the two children, about fix
weeks since. .
Ihe President of the United States has been pleased to ap
point the Hon. William Drayton Judge of the Federal
Court for South-Carolina Diflrict, vice the Hon. Thomas Pinck

There was no mail from the southward of the

SIR,
QU EST lON eighteenth.â" Does fufficient tran
, quility, contentment, andprofperity, reign in
thjc places where the war does not rage ? Can one fttf-
Jicientlyfubjijl there without feeling the opprejjion of the
taxes ? Does plenty abound there ? Is there more than
is necessary Jor confumptiov ? Are the people well af
filed and encouraged to pursue the war, and endure
its calamities P or is there poverty and dejection ?"
There has been more of this tranquility and
contentment, and fewer riots, infurre<slions, and
seditions, throughout the whole war, and in the
periods of its greatelt distress, than there was for
seven years before the war broke out, in those
parts that lam best acquainted with As to fub
lillence, there never was or will be any difficulty.
There never was any real want of any thing but
â warlike Itores and cloathing for the army, and
fait and rum both for the army and people ; but
they have such plentiful importations of thel'e
articles now, that there is no want, except blan
kets, cloathing and warlike stores for the army.
The taxes arerifing very high, but there never
"will be more laid on than the people can bear,
becaule the representatives who lay them tax
tiiemfelves and their neighbours in exac r t pro
portion.â^The taxes indeed fall heavielt upon the
rich, and the higher clafles of people.
The earth produces grain and meat in abun
dance ior theconfumption of the people, for the
support of the army, and for exportation.
The people are more universally well effected
and encouraged to pursue the war, than are the
people of England, France, or Spain, as far as I
can judge.
As to poverty, there is hardly a begger in the
country.âAs to dejection, I never saw, even at
tha time of our greateit danger and perplexity,
so much of it as appears in England, or France
upon every intelligence of a difaftrons event.
The great source of grief and affiiiftion, is the
fluctuation of the paper money ; but this,although
it occasions unhappinefs, has no violent or fatal

T hough sadly I your charms survey :
I once was wont to linger here,

Scenes of my Youth ! pale Sorrow flings
A shade o'er all your beauties now ;
And robs the moments of their wings
That scatter pleasures as they flow.
While, still, to heighten every care,
Reflettion tells me, such things were.
'Twas here a tender mother strove
To keep my happinefsin view ;

That foft compaflion ever knew.
In whom the virtues all combin'd ;
On whom I could with faith rely :
To whom my heart and foul were join*d
By mild Affe6Hon's primal tie !
Who Imiles in Heav'n, exempt from care,
Whiiftl remember, such thincs were.
'Twas here, where calm and tranquil reft,
O'erpays the peasant for his toil,
That, Hrft in blcifing, I was blest
With glowing Friend fliip's open smile.
My friend, far distant, doomed to roam,
Now braves the fury of the seas ;
He fled his peaceful happy home,
His little fortune to encreafe.
While bleeds afrefli the wound of care,
When I remember such things were.
Twas hereâe'en in this blooming grove,
I fondly gaz'd on Laura's charms,
Who, blulhing, own'd a mutual love,
And melted in my youthful arms.
Thohard the foul-conflicting ftiife,
Yet Fate, the cruel tyrant, bore
Far from my fight, the charm of life
The lovely maid whom I adore.
'Twould ease my foul of all its care
Could I forget that such things win.
Here firft I saw the Morn appear
Ofguiltlefs Pleasure's ihining day ;
I met the dazzling brightness here,
Here mark'd the foit Reclining ray,
Beheld the skies, whose dreaming light
Gave splendor to the parting fun ;

And all their mingled glories gone !

VALENTINE MORRIS
DIED, as the expreflive common phrase is, of
a broken heart !
Those changes and chances, which had been
through the latter end of his life, from bad and
worle, bore hard and heavy 011 him, till his
spirit, in spite of much strong effort, quite funk
under them.
He had enjoyed in good days, great resources
of temper, intellecft, and good spirits. Onquef
tions of taste and the finer arts, to embellilh and
plealure life, lew men could be more expert and
ready, either for thought or actionâeither to
tell what others did, or indeed to do, what by
others will be told. J
When his days, alas ! where good no moreâ
those resources in great part failed him. His con
versation-talents flaggedâHis mind, excelling
in powers of judgment, gradually grew motion
leis and dimânot willing to distinguish itfelfâ
not able to contribute to the delight of others
His temper alone lived to the lastâand it is
here, from the fragments of his heart, you could
understand how large and valuable it was before
it was broken ! Unregarded to the last, by ob
duracy, or what is worse perhaps, the love of
money, he was fcarcly ever peevishâpenurious
he was never. Little as he had left, the writer
of this article, has seen him, with admiration,
give of that little ; and handled as he was by
his own woes, he (hewed a mind at leisure to at
tend to any severer fufFerings in others.
And yet, in good men's lives, not exasperated
by shame or guilt, what fufFerings could be more
severe ? He loftÂ« wife ,â.ft deplorably; who, if
a Shenftone was a judge, was more amiablethan
himfelf. She had fallen into diftra&ion long be
fore she fell into the grave. By the Coarfefripe
of unrelenting law he was driven from his home
and a homy with such never-cloying amenity as
Piercefield . From thence he was consigned to
