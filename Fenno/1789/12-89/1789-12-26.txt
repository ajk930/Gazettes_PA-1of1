SKETCH ON POETRY.
IT has been observed, that it seldom falleth to
the share of one man, to be both a philosopher
and a poet. Tliefe two characters in their full
extent, may be said to divide betwixt them the
whole empire of genius ; for all the productions
of the human mind, fall naturally under two
heads, works of imagination, and -works of reason.
There are indeed several kinds of composition,
which, to be perfect, must partake of both. In
our lnoft celebrated hillorians, for instance, we
meet with ajult mixture of the penetration of the
philosopher, and the ardor of the poet ; (till their
departments are very wide of one another, and
a finall degree of attention will be fufficient to
lhew, why it is so extremely difficult to unite in
any high degree, the excellence of each. The end
of the poet is to give delight to his readers, which
he attempts by addrelling their fancy, and moving
their sensibility. The philosopher proposes merely
to initruct, and therefore thinks it enough if he
jjrefents his thoughts in that order, which will
render them molt perspicuous, and seems bed
adapted to gain the attention. Their views de
mand therefore a very different procedure. All
that pafles under the eye of the poet lie surveys
iri one particular view : Every form and image
under which he prelentsit to the fancy, are des
criptive of its effects : lie delights to paint every
object in motion, that he may raise afimilar agita
tion in the bofomof his reader ; but the calm and
deliberate thinker, on the contrary, makes it his
chief endeavor to seek out the remoter causes
and principles which give birth to tbefe appear
ances.
It is the highest exertion of the philosopher to
Itrip off the falfe colors that serve to disguiseâto
remove every particular which fancy, or which
folly have combined, and to prelent to view the
simple and naked tr.utli. But the poet, who ad
drefles the imagination and the heart, neglects
no circumstance, however fanciful, which may
serve to attach liisdefcriptions more closely to the
humanmind. In describing the awful appearan
ces of nature, he gladly avails liimfelf of all those
inagic terrors, with which ignorance and super
stition have furrorrnded them ; for though the
light of reason dispels these shades, they anftoer
the higher purposes ofthepoet in awakening the
passions.
Is is the delight ofpoetry to combine and aflociate;
of philofophyto separate and diftiiigtiifh. The one
releniblesa fkilful anatomilt, who lays open every
thing that occnrs, and examines the finallell par
ticular of its make. The other, a judicious
painter, who conceals what would offend the eye,
and enrbcllifhes Â«very subjeCt he undertakes to
represent. The fameflbjeCt therefore which has
engaged the investigating powers of the philoso
pher, takes a very different appearance from the
forming hand of the post, who adds every grace
of coloring, and artfully hides the nakedness of
its inwardftru<srure, on derail the agreeable fold
ings of elegance and beanty. In philosophical
difcuitioiis, the end of which is to explain, every
part ought to be unf >lded with the molt lucid
perspicuity. But woi ks of imaginatioji never ex
ert a more powerful influence, than when the
author has contrived to throw over them a /hade
of datirnefs and doubt. The reason of Phis is
obvious, the evils we but imperfectly discern seem
to bid defiance to cautiouâthey nffeit the mind
with a fearful anxiety, and by presenting noljm
jt, the imagination easily conceives them bound
less. Thefe'fpecies o'fcompofition diffcritiHfur

velty, surprise, and astonishment, kindle in the
bofoin the fire of poetry, whilst philol'ophy is
reared up by cool and continued efforts. There
is one circumstance relating to this kind ofcoifi
pofition too material to be omitted. Jnsvery na
tion it has been found that poetry is ofinuch ear
lier date than any other production of the hu
man mind ; as in the individual, tjie imagination
and pallions are more vigorous in youth, which
in mature age subside, and give way to thought
and reflection. Something limilar to this leenis
to vary that genius which distinguishes the differ
ent periods offociety. The jnoft admired poems
have been the offspring of uncultivated ages. Pure
poetry, conlifts in descriptions of nature, and the
display of the pallions ; to each of which, a rude
Hate of society is better adapted, than one more
polished. They who live inthat early period, in
which art has not alleviated the calamities of life,
are forced to feel their dependence upon nature ;
her appearances are ever open to their view, and
therefore strongly imprinted on their fancy.â
! hdy fhrinkat the approach of a ftorni, and mark
with anxious attention every variation of the sky.
1 lie change of feafbn, cloud and funihine, seren
ity and teuipeft, are to theiu reallources of sorrow
and of joy ; and we lueed not therefore wonder
they Itiould describe with energy wlTat tliey feel
with lb much force. But it is one chief advantage
of civilization, that by enabling us in fbine mca
fure to controul nature, we become left
its influence. It opens many newfources of en
joyment. In this situation the gay and cheerful
can always mingle in company; whilst the diffn
lion of knowledge opens to the studious a new
world, over which the whirlwind and the blast
can exert no influence. The face of nature gra
dually reci.es ft otu vi;-w, and tliofe who attempt
todelcriue ir, often content theiufelves with copy
ing from books, whereby thc-ir descriptions want
the frefhuefs and glow of original observation,
like the image of au objedr refratfied through va
rious mediums, each of which varies somewhat
of its iorin, and lefl'ons its splendor. The poe
try of uncivilized nations, has therefore often
excelled the productions of a more refined people,
in elevation and pathos. Accustomed to survey
nature in her general form, and grander move
ments, their descriptions cannot fail of carrying
with them an air of greainefs and sublimity. They
paint Icenes which everyone has felt, and which
tlietefore need only to be presented, to awaken
a iimiliar feeling again. For a while they delight
us with the vaftnefs of their conceptions, but the
wantof various embelliihinent, and the frequent
recurrence of the fame images, soon fatigue the
attention, and their poetry may be compared to
the world of waters, which fills us with amaze
ment, but upon which we gaze for a moment, and
then turn away our eyes. It is the advantage at
enlightened nations,that their fu peri or knowlege
enables them to supply greater variety ; aud to
renderpoetry more copious. They allure us with
an agreeable succession of images. They do not
weary with uniformity, nor overpower us with
any oneexertion, but by perpetually fhifting the
scenes, they keep us in a conlfant hurry of de
light,

Shakespea reV Midfummcr Night's Dream.
I cannot help observing that poeticalgenius feeijxs
capable of a much greater variety than talents for
phiiqfophizing. The power of thinking and rea
soning is a simple energy, which exerts itfelf in
all men nearly iu the fame manner. Indeed the
chief varieties that have been observed in niay
be traced to two, a capacity of al'jtrail and mathe
watical rejifoniv.gâand ja talent for cpUcfting fails,
and making obfervatiotLS. These qualities of mind
blendid in various proportions, will for the most
part account for any peculiarities attending men's
modes of thinking. But the ingredients that
conftiiute a poet are far more various .and compli
cated. A poet is in a high degree under tjie in
fhience.of the imagination and paffiong, principles
of mind very various and extensive. Whatever
is complicated is capable of much greater variety,
and will be extremely more diverfified in its form,
than that which is .mure simple. In this cafe every
ingredient is a fouroe of variety, and by being
mingled in the compolition, in a greater or less
degree, may give original catt to the whole.
To explain the particular causes which vary the
direction of the fancy in different men, would
perhaps be 110 eÂ»fy taik. We are led, it maybe,
at firft, through accident, to the survey of one class
of objeiflsâthis calls up a particular train of
thinking, which we afterwards freely indulge :
[Â£ Ufb.llJh.tiS bn l\ t<iHefday and Saiurd.tj.~j
It ealily finds access to the mind upon aliocca&uns.
The flighted accident serves to fyggclk it. It is
nursed 1)/ habit, reared up with attention, till ic
gradually swells to a torrent, which bears away
every obllacle, and awakens in the mind a con
fcioufneik of peculiar pofvers. Such sensations
eagerly impel to a particular purpose, and are fuf
ficient to give to compofitien a diftirici and deter
minate character. Poetical genius is I'ikewiie
much under the influence oi' the pafiions. The
pleased and the splenetic, the fcriousand the gay,
lurvey nature with very ditferent eyes. That ele
vation of fancy which with a luelaucholly tur:i
will produce scenes of gloomy grandeur and aw
ful solemnity, will lead another of chearful com
plexion to delight, by presenting images of splen
dor and gaiety,and by inspiring gladii'efs andjoy.
Tho these and other limilarcau'fes may betraced,
that boundless variety which diverfifies the work.*
of imagination, and which is so great that 1 have
tho't the perusal of fine authors, is like traversing
the different regions of thd earth ; fotneglow with
a pleaf'autand refreshing warmth, wlnlit others
kindle with a tierce and fiery heat. In one we meet
with scenes of elegance and arf, all is correct
and regular, and a thousand beautiful objects
spread their colors to the eye and regale the sen
ses : In another we behold nature in an unadorn
ed majestic flmplicityâfcouring the plain with
tempeflsâfitting upon a rock, or walking upon
the wings of the wind. Here wc meet with a
Sterne who fans us with the foftefl breeze
of delicacy : And there with a Rousseau who
hurries us along in whirlwind and tempest.
Hence that delightful succession of emotions which
are felt in the bosom of sensibility. V/e feel the
empire of genius, we imbibe Ls impreflicu, and
the mind resembles aninchantedmanfion, which
at one touch of fouie fupejior hand,at one, bright
ens into beauty, and a: another time, darkens
into horror !
Even where the talents of men approach most
nearly, an attentive eye will ever remark some
small shades of difference, fulficient to distinguish
them. Perhaps few authors have been diilin
guifhed by more similar features of character,
than Ho.m ta. and Miiton. That vpjftnefs of
thought which fills the imagination, and thatfen

il o,MEÂ£ lived in an early age, before knowledge
was much advanced, he could derive little from
any acquired abilities, and may be therefore ftiled
the poet oj naturt â¢ to this fpurce perhaps we may
trace the principal difference between Homer
and Mii.tov. Thp Grecian poet was lefttothe
natural movements of his own mind, and to the
full influence ps [hat variety of paitions, which
are common roall. His conceptions aretheiefoii:
diffinguilhed by their fiinplicitv and force. In
Milton who was Jlulled in almoli every de
partment of science, learning seems fometiines
to have iliaded the fplendnr of his genius. No
epic poet excites emotion lb fervid as Homer, or
poflefles so much fire ; but in point of fubliwty
he can not be compared to Milton. I rather
think the Greek popt has been thought to excell
in this quality more than he really docs, for
want of a proper conception of itseffeCls. When
the perusal of an author raises lis above our ufuaJ
tone of mind, we immediately ascribe these sen
sations to the fublinjc, without considering whe
ther they light on the imagination or the feel
ings : Wheilier they elevate the fancy or only
fire the paflions. The sublime has for its object
the fancy only ; and its influence is not so much
to occasion any fervor of feeling, as the calmness
of fi*ed aflonifhment. If we consider the sublime
as thus distinguished from every other quality
Mt j-Ton will appear to poflefs it in an uncommon
degree : And here indeed lies the feeret of his
power. The perusal of Homer ijjfpires us with
an ardent sensibility. Milton with the ftillnels
of surprize. The one fills and delights the mind
with the confluence of various emotions. The
other amazes with the valbiefs of his ideas. The
movements of Milton's mind are steady and
progrelriveâhe carries the fancy through vari
ous fucceflive stages ,of elevation, and gradually
encreafes the heat, by adding fuel to the fire.
1 he flights of Homer are more sudden and trans
itory. Milton whose mind was enlightened
by science aj)pears the molt compre'nenfiveâhe
fliews more acutenefs in his reflections, and more
subtlety of thought. Homer who lived iuor,e
with men, and had perhaps a deeper tin&ure ot
the human paflions, is by far the most vehement
and piiftnrefque. To the view of Milton the
wide scenes of the universe seem to have been
thrown open, which he regards with a cool and
comprehensive survey, little agitated, and supe
rior to tliofe emotions which affedt inferior mor
tals. Homer when he rises the highest goes notbeyond the bounds ofhuihan natureâheilill con
nects his dcfciiption with human patiions, and
tho his ideas have less Inblimity, iliey have molt
fire. The appetite for gr'eatneis, that appetite
which always grasps at more than it can contain,
is never so fully gratified as in the perusal of pa
radise lojt. In following Milton we grow fa
miliar with new worlds. We traverse the im
jiienfities ot ipace, wandering in amazement, and
finding no bounds ! Homer confines the mindte
a narrower circle, but that circle he brings near
er the eyeâhe fills it with a quicket- fuccelfion of
objects, and makes it the scene of more interesting
ac'tion. H.

A CORRESPONDENT has lately perused the
publication of a letter giving a curious ac
count of the rifingof the waters in lake Ontario,
which, from their continual advances, have a
larmed the inhabitants around its borders to a great
degree, as several buildings which ltood at a con
venient distance from its ancient boundaries now
stand seven feet under water. He takes this op
portunity to remark that the tide waters in gene
ral 011 the eallern coast of North America seem at
present to be gradually gaining on the land, which
is mod perceivable in high northern latitudes.
With a view to ascertain this matter, he has col
lected a great number of concurring accounts, a
mong which is a certificate, dated 19th of May,
1788, from a certain Joseph Rice, an intelligent
man, who was questioned 011 this account, the
lame who brought through these States a moose
deer, which he caught to the northward, who of
fered in the prefcnce of several credible witnefles
to swear to the truth of his aflertions, which are
as followâThat he, the said Joseph Rice, when
at home, relidcs 011 the banks of Annapalis river,
in Nova-Scotia, about miles from the inouth
thereofâthat along this river are large bodies of
ground which fliew the Humps and roots of trees,
an incredible space below the common high-water
markâthat the waters continue to rife higher e
very yearâthat he had often heard an elderly per
son declare, that they had risen so much there,
that the tides extend now 50 miles higher up An
napolis river than formerly.

T
X HE tyranny of superstition over the hopes and fears of an ig
norant world, was long maintained with afway totally incredible
to the present enlightened age.. The agency of evil spirits in par
ticular, appears to have been recognized in such manner, that the
providence ol the Deity was considered in a subordinate and fe~
condary point of view : The Devil is called 44 the prince of the
power of the air From this appellation he is supposed to
44 Rule in the ukitlwind, and direst thejlorm
as if, the Creator and Lord of all, because he had, in some fenfe>
pe rfe&ly unintelligible to us, afligned the air as the element of
evil spirits, had alio given them the sovereign direÂ£Uon of its
powers, and abilitv to exercise those powers for the annnoyance
of mankind. I iometimes think we derogate from the benevo.
lenceof the Deity, in afligning so large a sphere of action to the
Devil: As a celebrated author fays, 44 I never could think it for
the intcrcfl of religion, that the providence of God (hould be el
bowed, as it were, quite out of the world by a fyflem of doemon
ifm. Human exiitence is a Hate of trial and probation. Natural
evils are permitted, to answer important purpofi s ; they are easily
difcerncd to be a link in that (yflem, by which the univerfc is go
verned, and arc surely competent to the purpoles of providence,
in refining and purifying our natures, and raifmg them to that
of excellencc, which (hall, through the infinite benevo
lence of God, prepare them lor immortal happiness. Upon this
principle it appears to be unneceflary to intei pose upon every de
viation from the paths of rcÂ£titude, the influence of the Devil.
It is wrong : It certainly tends to abate our consciousness of de
merit, and tends to lull our consciences to sleep, when the flings
of guilt ought to rouse us to sorrow and repentance.

SIR, â  "
QUESTION twenty-eighth.â" has America
_ " gained, or lojt, by the mutual capture of
" Jhips ? How much is the benefit, or prejudice, of
" it by calculation?"
America lias gained. She took early, from
the Englifh,ordinance and ammunition (hips, and
supplied lierfelf in that way with thole articles
when Ihe had them not, and could not otherwise
obtain them ; she has taken, in this way, a great
number of British and German soldiers ; lhe has
taken a vail number of seamen, who have gene
rally inlifted on board our privateers ; Ihe has
taken great quantities of provision, cloathing,
arms, and warlike stores ; /lie has taken every
year more and more, fmce, 1775, and will pro
bably continue to take more and more every year,
while the war lasts. I have certain intelligence,
that there have been this year carried intolJofton
and Philadelphia only, ninety-nine veflels, in the
months of July and August. On board of thel'e
veflels there were not less than eight hundred fea
infn : IV'any of the ships were very rich. The
veflels the Englilh have taken from the Americans
wercof (mall value : This year they have been
few in number.
I am not able to give you an exa<ft calculation.
The Quebec ships were worth from thirty to for
ty thousand pounds sterling each, and there were
two-and-forty of them in number.
Privateering is a great nutfery for seamen ;
and if the Americans had not imprudently facri
-ficedfuch a uumber of their frigates and priva
teers in the attack and defence of places, these
alone would, by this time, well nigb have ruin
ed the Britiih commerce, navy, and army.

queUion, which is, " What are the real damages
" sustained, or ft ill to be fuffered, by the loss oj
" Charteflon ? And mhett influence it has had upon
" the minds of the people ?"
An interruption of the commerce of indigo
and'rice ; the loss of many Negroes, which the
Engli/h will steal from the plantations, and fend
to the Weft-India i (lands for sale â , a great deal
of plunder of every fort ; much unhappinefs a
mong the people, and several lives of very wor
thy men will be loft: But the climate will be
death to Luropean troops ; and, at an immense
expence of men and money, they will ravage
for a while, and then disappear.
The effect of thel'urrender of Charipfton, and
the defeat of Gates, has only been to awaken the
people from the dreams of peace.
1 he artifices of the English, holding out ideas
of peace, seem to have deceived both the Ameri
cans and their allies, while they wereolily con
triving means to succour Gibraltar, and invade
Carolina. The people are now convinced of their
mistake, and generally roused. But these dis

SEASONABLE HINTS.
AT this inclement season, as our seamen are
often put to difficulties, and our mercantile
interest l'ubjeet to great loss in consequence of the
obftrucftion which happens to the navigation by
the formation of the ice in our rivers and bays,
whereby veflels have been impeded in their couife
lometimes to the great injury of veflels, loss of
property, and endangering, if not actual loss of,
the lives ot many of that valuable class of men,
the seamenâas well as attended with iufferino
and hardlhips ; which it becomes the humane to
endeavor to provide against, so far as isconfiftent
with tlieirabilitics : With this view, I have wish
ed t.iat the following simple method oJ" breaking*
away the icca-head of the veflbl might generally
1:2 known âfor which purpose the printers of the
several newspapers on the continent may give it
a place in;heir papers.
V. hen a veflel is inclosed with ice, which is
practicable to make a way through, let a boat be
taken a-head of the veflel, and fixed with a rope
through the ring-bolt in the head of the boat, up
to the iiea ! of the bowsprit; then hoist the fore
part of the boat up a little, so that it will have
a bearing forward 0111 his rope ; fallen the stern
of the boat to the head of the veflel, and break a
way tlie ice about the bow of the veflel, so as to
let the stem of the boat fink a little into the
water, and about one third of the length of the
boat from the stern, to have a bearing with the
keel of the boat on the edge of the unbroken
ice a-head : now load the boat with eight or ten
barrels of Hour, or other heavy 1 umber fufficient,
and let two men get into the boar, and rock it
from fide to lide continually, at the fame time
have the neceHavy fail set onboard the veflel, and
the boat will break away with her keel, the ice,
so as to admit apaflage for the veflel.
This method has been fuceeffively pratftifed in
divers inftanccs, so as to bring vetlels through a
body of ice which appeared â¢ .herwife impracti
cable ; and at tlie rate of three miles an hour,
has cleared apaflage out of creeks, and up creeks,
through a body ot iGe which would bear, as my
informant mentioned, a fled and two horses, to
the admiration of foine Ipectators.
The very aukward manner which some foreign
ers, who maybe unpradtifed in navigating north
ern ihorcs, have attempted to disengage veflels
from among ice in our river, has induced the
writer of this more particularly for their infor
mation, to communicate this simple method of
breaking it tor their benefit : The American na
vigators, being remarked for their activity and
ingenuity, may not fiand in need of any hints
on this head. B.
