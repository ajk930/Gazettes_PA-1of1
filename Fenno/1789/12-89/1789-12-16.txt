" Suspicion, for the jttojl part, proceeds from Come
fctf-dejeii
TO be of a suspicious temper is not always
incompatible with the character of a
wife or a virtuous man. Such a temper, how
ever, more generally characterizes persons who
are weak or vicious. A man of knowledge and
integrity may have perceived, in his intercourse
with society, so many instances of deception, and
experienced such a variety of misfortunes, that
all human affairs, wear in his view, some appear
ance of uncertainty. When, from such cuufcs a
man guards hiinfelf against the ignorance or dif
honelty of thole with whom he is connected, it
may be denominated circumspection rather than
jealousy. His diltruft is not without some foun
dation in the general reason of things. It is the
effect of reflection and experience, rather than
pallion and prejudice. It operates uniformly, and
does not nnreafonably discriminate particular
characters as objects of suspicion. Though this
kind of caution often has the complexion of jea
louly, when exercised towards individuals, yet it
is not meant to indicate specially any bad opin
ion of them. Nothing more can be inferred from
such habitual precaution in any person, than that
he is fenlible there are vices and imperfections
more or less incidental to all men ; and that the
belt way to escape the snares of the wicked is to
carry a vigilant eye over the whole of mankind.
The suspicion oflow, uninformed minds, is of
quite another nature. It selects individuals as
objects of prey without any reason, and condemns
them without inercy or trial. It so often imagines
evil without any proof as to render a perlbn
wretched in himfelf and dangerous to his friends.
When suspicion operates in this manner, it de
notes weakness or vice. Sometimes people sus
pect others of bad intentions from an ignorance
of the motives and i-ellraints which their charac
ter and luuation are calculated to impose. And
for.ietiines men feel fuel, depravity of heart, as to
imagine :hat others are too much like themselves
not to pratftife the mifchiefs, which are in their
power.
Such low minds are most apt to harbor suspi
cions againlt persons in public office. It is not re
markable that a man, utterly unacquainted with
the inducements that arefpanfible character feels
to difcliarge his duty, should fufpeit that he will
be regardless of the interest or honor of his con
stituents. Nor mult we be surprised. that vicious,
unprincipled men excite clamors among the peo
ple against their rulers; for a difhonefl: man acts
confidently in apprehending from ofhers the
evils which lie would commit, were he in their
situation. To indicate millrull over those we
employ is apt to make them lose their sentiments
of honor, and to weaken the effect of refponftbi
lity. For when a man knows he is suspected, he
becomes familiarized to reproach, and the (ting
ofit is taken away, it is highly expedient to im
pose checks on persons employed in public bnfi
nefs ; but an oversight that looks like jealousy,
will be more likely to make good men bad, than
so reform those who were bad before.

On the means of preftrving Public Liberty.
W HEN a fyltem of national freedom hath
been established by great exertions, it be
comes an interesting enquiry how it /hall be belt
pref'erved. The speculative PhiJofopher, and the
practical Statesman have united their endeavors
to answer this question.
A natural thirll for power in the human mind,
with the emoluments springing from authority,
tend to a general encroachment 011 the rights of
human natureâEven patriots and lionefl men
have their weakness, pallions, and appetites, and
in little inltances may be tyrants, while they wilh
for general freedom.
Many fyltems have been formed which in theory
appear almolt perfectâmany checks have been
deviled ; Itill there are, and we must expect there
will be, abuses of power, until the nature of man
is delivered from its present imperfections. In
every state, some person or persons mult be repre
sentatives of the public, in whose hands the power
of the whole is lodged, for general protection ,â¢
andwithout this investiture of public authority,
to rettrain and punifh,the wicked will be a Icourge
to all within their reach ; and it is also poflible,
that the very persons who are clothed with public
power, may become cruel and unjust. Without
power in some national head, anarchy will be the
itate of man, every one will retaliate and abnfe
. his pallions dictate, which is the worst of
WEDNESDAY, December 16, 1739.
tyrannies : With power the rulers of a nation
may do injury, for man is frailâgreat men may
misjudgeâgood men may fall.
To give any man unlimited power, is a grea
ter temptation than ought to be placed before a
trail being ; at the fame time, placing too many
checks oil rulers is in effeiit difinembering the
body, and destroys its energy of atftion and of
defence, both against foreign enemies and its own
evil fubjedts. So far as we may judge from
American experience, a nation of freemen, in
modelling their government, arc more apt to err
in overliniiting, than in giving too great scope
to the power of rulersâln both cases the conse
quence is nearly the fame ; for when the citizens
find their constitutional government cannot pro
tect and dojuftice, they will throw- themselves
into the hands of some bold usurper, who promises
much to them, but intendsonly for himfelf ; and
in this way very many free dates have loft their
liberties. The forming a constitution of govern
ment is a serious matter âthe spirit of deliberati
on and concession, with which it hath been taken
up by the citizens at large, and thus far carried
into effecft,is anew event in the history of mankind.
The present conflitution of the United States,
appears to embrace the eflential principles both
of freedom and energy in national operations ;
ttill very little dependence is to be made on this
Conflitution, as a future fafeguard to the Ameri
can liberties.âl would by no means undervalue
those fyftematie produiflions, which we call the
Constitutions of the several States, and of the
Unionâthey express our present ideas of the ru
lers' power and duty, and the fubjedts' rightsâ
they are a written basis on which national habits
will be formed, and in this way will cheriilifenti
ments of freedom and retard the rife of oppres
sionâon these your children will look as maxims
of their fathers' wisdom ; but if they have no
other protection, the lust of those who have op
portunity will undermine their privileges. Every
generation must aflert its own liberties ; and for
this the collective body of the people must be in
formed. A general diffuiion of science, in every
class of people, is the true cause of that new
series of events which have taken place in the
United States. In every other country, a great
proportion of the people are unacquainted with
lettersâln several great and civilized kingdoms
of Europe, it is but a comparative few who can
read and write. The vast number of well mean
ing and ignorant people, become instruments of
superior policy, to oppose every effort of nation
al freedom ; but in America there is no order or
great number of people, who can be made sub
servient tofuch ungenerous purposes.âThe late
war, was a war of the peopleâgeneral informa
tion convinced them of its justice and that their
all was endangered ; hence sprang their unani
mity, exertion and patience; and a traitor could
in no part of the country find either asylum or
aid.
The formation of our present government, by
the deliberation of three million of citizens, is the
highest evidence of, and the greatest effe&we
have yet seen from general information.
The fame causes which have given you vidtory,
and a constitution, combining the rights of man
vrith the powers of government, will certainly
be fufficient to preserve national liberty, and make
your children as free as their fathers. A few en
lightened citizens may he dangerousâlet all be
enlightened, and opprefliqn must cease, by the
influence of a ruling majorityâfor it can never
be their interest to indulge a system incompatible
with the rights of freemen. Those institutions
are the most effectual guards to public liberty,
which difFufe the rudiments of literature among
a people.
Let the raof perfect constitution finite wisdom
can devise, be adopted ; if succeeding generations
become ignorantârifalarge part of the people
are destitute of letters, their precious patrimony
will be cheated from their handsânot perhaps,
by violence, but by a course of artful measures,
against which ignorant men have no defence.
A man declaiming for liberty, and fufFerjng his
children to grow up without education, a<fts most
absurdly, and prepares them to be licentious,but
not free.
The road to preferment is open to all, and the
common citizen may fee his children poflefs the
firll offices of State, if endowed with genius, ho
nesty, and scienceâhaving such incentives to fi
delity, the remiss parent is unpardonable. As
the best prefervativeof national liberty, the pub
lic ought to patronize institutions to inftrudl the
children of poor peopleâfor, give them know
ledge, and they will never be the instruments of
injuringmankind. A few incautious expressions
in our Constitution, or a few salaries of office too
great for the contraifted feelings of those who
[Publi/hid in JVedr.cfday and Saturday ,'j
do not know the worth of merit and integrity,
can never injure the United States, while litera
ture is generally diffufed, and the plain citizen
and planter reads and judges for himfelf.
The American Legillature could not do an acft
more favorable to general humanity, liberty and
virtue, than to endow the Uiiiverlities, rising iu
aim oil every State, with such funds in the unlo
cated territory, as would enable them to furnifii
the bell means of inftrn&ion, and at an easy rate,
to the foils of those who have moderate wealth.
Difleminate science through all grades of people,
and it will forever vindicate your rights, which
are now well underltood, and firmly fixed. Sci
ence will do more than thisâit will break the
chains, and unbolt the prison doors of despotism.
At tlieprefent moment, France is an instance of"
its influence : The wealthy fubjec r ts of that coun

to be freeâO France 1 I love thee, and thy sons.
When my nightly fupplicauon forgets to ask a
blefiing on thy great exertions, and on thy coun

Extrafl of a letter front Mom. tie Ville le Roux, ti
his Conflituents at I'Orient, dated Paris, 00. 5.
I ARRIVED at Versailles, having pafled with
out hindrance through the body of women â
This day I found the Aflembly deliberating on the
King's an fwer refpetfting the Bill of Rights,and.
the Constitution decreed by 11s.
I lhall now only inform you, that when the Duke
de Liancourt saw it, and the debates that follow
ed, he afliired Mr. Kervegant, that he had seen
the King previous to his coming to the Aflernbly,
alid thathis Majelty had laid, That "the Nation
al Atfembly Jliall be fatisfied vjithhim that day. I have
accepted, purely and [imply, the articles of the Consti
tution, and the Bill of Rights. IV'e undirfland one
another. f They -diijh jor -what is right, and so do I.
And 1 now leave you to go to the chace."
From the immense numberof people thatap
peared, I apprehended, that the body of women
were on their way : In approaching the avenue,
I found the Life-Guards on horle-back,with sword
in hand.âl trembled for them, as they had ag
gravated the hunger of the people, by giving a
splendid repast some days before, where a profu
lion of every kind of food was seen.âl thought
force was not a proper remedy to oppose to a body
of women, that were to be calmed by more gentle
means : That the barrier, however strong, would
not shut them from the avenue of the throneâfor
the event proved that it was ineffectual. They
entered into the King's apartments, where he re
ceived them with affability, and promised he
would issue new orders for a freih supply of pro
visions.
While all the preceding circumstances were
taking place, we held the feflion at the Aflembly.
The deputies of the Parisian women, having a
speaker at their head, demanded the entrance of
the hallâthey were accordingly introduced ac
the bar, and told their complaints. The debates
then turned upon deviling a method for the bet
ter providing provisions for Parisâevery one was
propofinghis ideasâwhen a multitude of women,
presented theinfelves at the door, and were dis
tributed by clafles into the different feats, and by
degrees introduced themselves into the galleries*
âThe deliberations continued notwithstanding,
a great part of which were applauded.âWhen
the decrees pafled, a number of women spread
themselves over the Hall, and occupied the Cler
gymen's feats that they had left vacant.
We were upon the point of retiring, -When the
President announced to us that the King had pure
ly and simply accepted the Bill of Rights, and
the articles of the Constitution. We weie ;hen
once more informed that the King's conscience
had been surprised. 1 left the roomâthe women
and a number of deputies still remaining.
Several reports having circulated that the King
was preparing to depart for Paris, and the Na
tional Aflembly not having received any official
accounts thereof, they resolved, that the person
of the King and they were inseparable. A depu
tation of 36 were named to inform the King of it.
Two of us were dispatched to the King to know
whether his determination was to leave VersaillesCf fitJt, lie anfwere cl, that in one hour he, the
Queen, and his children should set out for Paris.
A short time after I left the palace, in the midlt
of the soldiers, who Ihewed every mark of refpec't
to the people and their deputies.âlhad not been
to the palace a long time beforeâl think I should
not be fond of returning at so dull a moment.â
The Ocil-ac-bxuJ was filled with people in the
greatest conltei nation. In the room adjoining to
the King's cabinet, was the Queen in tears, with
the King's aunt and lifters, endeavouring to de
vise means for confutation- She appeared too
deeply affeCted to be sensible of their efforts.â
The person that spoke to the King, received this
answerâ" I am' exceedingly grateful for the new
proof the National Afc?nlty have given me of their
attachment. 1 never will separate myfelj from them.
â / shall depart in an hour -with the Qjieen a,:d my
children, for Parisâand there 1 Jhall have a room
preparedJor the National A[fembly to continue their
debates in."âWe afterwards returned to the Af
l'embly, where M. Neckar's system of Finance
was accepted with some few amendments. In the
mean time the King departed with his family for
Paris."
L O N D O N, October 20.
We have, in our late publications, hinted our
taking exceptions to four eflential articles, which
the National Allembly of France are reported to
have agreed upon. It is not proper for us to ob
ject to any public act done by such a respectable,
numerous, illustrious body of men, without (hew
ing the ground of our objection, which we thus
humbly attempt to perform with becoming free
dom, without intending the lead: disrespeCt to that
august Allembly, or any of the members, the mo
vers of thole relblutions we disapprove of.
In the firft place, then, we highly disapprove
of the very firft art of" incorporating themselves,
or constituting themselves one individual allem
bly, or legislative body !" Here they loft fight
entirely of the Constitution of Great Britain, as
a model, if ever they had it in serious contempla
tion,as we really flattered ourselves they had; per
haps from an over fondnefs we have always en
tertained, for what we have so often called our
excellent and unparalleled constitution, consider
ed in its purity, unmutilated by ministerial dila
pidations, and the inroads of corruption. By
this we loft fight of them, and all their future
plans and forms of government, in hopes, howe
ver, of meeting them on some other plan more
analogous to the temper, habits, ditpofitions, and
views of their fellow-fubjeCts.
For other reasons, besides their abandoning our
system, did we censure this original measure as
we may call it, of this great National Allembly.
First, they are too numerous to fit together,
deliberate calmly, debate freely, difcuii tho
roughly, and decide judicioully all the great im
portant fubje&s respeCting the formation of an
entire new constitution or frame of civil govern
ment, as well the legislative as executive powers,
and the putting them into regular, free, and easy
motion, upon a permanent,and sure foundation.
Secondly, They were a body compoled of such
different clafles or denominations and descriptions
of men, such as Princes of the blood (even some
who have eventual claims to the crown) nobles,
from the highest ranks to the lowest, archbishops,
bishops, abbeys, and clergy in general, great com
moners, representatives of provinces, cities, and
other distriCts, large and small; we may fuppol'e
merchants, traders, bankers, and various descrip
tions of men, all ailcmbled in one great body com
poled of such heterogeneous incompatible parts !
It w? . simply impossible to preserve order and me
thod among them, the very foul of public busi
ness ! To this source we trace all that disorder,
tumult, and confufion, which their proceedings
are branded with by their open enemies and le
crettraitors.
Thirdly, They have no regular, fixed, perma
nent head or Prelident of their Allembly, invert
ed with a proper authority to preserve order, point
out irregularities, correct miibehaviour, and en
force his rules, orders, and directions over refrac.
Tory individuals; consequently all these dillimi
lar members cannot unite and harmonize in one
great, noble, and practicable plan of government,
as defciibed above.
Before we dismiss this subjeCt at present, we
cannot refrain from animadverting upon a pro
pofkl recently made by one of the Members
which we have read with astonishment, viz.
" That the present Allembly fhouhl be diflblved,
and a new one chosen, fubjedt to this injunction,
that not one of the present Members Ihould be
le-eleCted !" This motion, if adopted, would
be a rock indeed upon which the National Refor
mation would split, and make a total fliipwreck,
without a poflibility, much less a probability, of
redemption ; there would be an end of all their
fcliemes and devices at once.
In the firft place, who is to diflolvethem ? Are
they to diflblvethemfelves ? This would be truly
a political filicide, and a mortal Itab to their Coun
try. If they are not to difiolve themselves, then
who is so do it ? The King, about whole power
they are now debating, or wherherhe is to have
a.iy power at all i Will thev quietly take their
diAblution from the man, wliofe negative voice,
to one {ingle resolution of theirs, they are now
warAly disputing ? Admitting they lliould thus
reel from one extreme to another, who is able
and willing to call, convoke, and meet a newaf
fembly, in the fame manner that they have been
called, &c. ? Do they think the King would
chearfully do all this for them ? If not, who is to
do it ? Are they willing to repeat the mode of
calling this present Aflembly, viz. a general ill -
lurrettion, a reiurreiftion of mob law, and of
mob executions, the plundering of the provinces,
and devaluation of the kingdom ? Tiiefe things,
and much more, would probably be the conse
quences of this rash measure of dilTolving them
selves by their own authority,or by the Royal fiat.
As friends of Liberty, and well-wifliers to the
afflicled, diltrefled and opprefled part of the
French people, we deliver our fentimenis freely ;
wilhing that, if these observations reach the eyes
or the ears of the leading men among them, they
may attend to them carefully, and avail tliem
felves of thele friendly hints, for the benefit of
the whole French nation, and for the general
repose of Europe.

Charity, despises all diflinctionsâit feels its

On THE PRESIDENT of the United States,
PuWJhcd in the MASSACHUSETTS CENTINEL.
grateful hearts with ihoutsof loud applause,
Hail the DEFENDER of his country's cause,
The CHIEF delighted, heais the loud acclaim,
For none, unheeding, near the voice of Fame :
And feels, unlike the heroes of mankind,
The conscious plaudit of the approving mind.
For pride may boait, yet merit only knows,
The inward Ljifs which alone bellows.
Tis not the fick'ning blail of party rage.
Nor the envenom'd sting of Slander'* page ;
Nor loathsome Envy's peftilcntial breath,
Can tint his laurels, with the blall of death.
Still uncorroded by the rull of years,
His name fliall live commensurate with the spheres.
So the tall rock, high on the mountain's brow,
Securely ft:md<, nor lears the Jlorms below,
And while the winds the face of earth deform,
Laughs at the whirlwind, and derides the ltorm.
When we aflume the sober garb of age,
Our youth lhall emulate the godlike rage,
And fpndly listen to the historic song,
Nor think, for once, an old man's tale too long.
Then fhali new Hbiriers, Aug the CHIEFTAIN'S waijs.
And not a Woman's, but a Nation's cause;
Nor need th' affilbnce of the bright abodes,
Columbia's Heroes supersede his Gods.
EXTRACT
of a Letter form Pari/, to a gentleman in New-Haven,
dated Augttjl 30th, 1789.
TT is extremely gratifying, my dear Sir, to have
spent the lalt fix months in this country â
where, next to the American revolution,the great
est and rnoft wonderful scenes are unfolding. The
progress of truth and reason is beyond calcula
tion. We might have believed from theory,
that government would meliorateâthat the peo
ple might discover in time that as laws are made
for them, they ought to be made by themâthat
Kiugs ihould be but Executive Magistrates, and
therefore fubjedt to the laws. But when wecon
fider the flow and altnoft imperceptible progress
of such ideas from the days of Magna Cliarta to
the last revolution in England, their retrogade
motion from the time of the great Henry, to
Louis XVIIII. in France, and their dormant Hate
for many ages in all the reft of Europe, it is afton
iftiing that so many events of this nature Ihould
be crowded into fifteen years. It is biv. since the
American war that the faculty of thinking has
been by any means general in France. The ex
ample of America in her theoretical ideas ofli.
berty has certainly been a great thing for France.
But greater, if poflible, will be her example in
the developement of these ideas in her govern
ment. The Constitution of France, which is in a
good degree of forwardnefs, will be as nearly
likethe American, as is consistent with having an
hereditary Chief Magistrate. If they had not a
King on hand, they would not create one. They
will now preserve him with such powers as the
people choose to delegate to their Executive
Chief. And he will gladly accept of what they
may give him, acknowledging the source from
whence it flows, the jus divinum of his fellow ci
tizens.
The other nations of Europe have now an ex
ample nearer homeâand they will soon follow
it. The gospel of civil liberty will run and be
glorifiedânations are coming to its light, and
Kings to the brightness of its rising. It cannot
be ten years before Germany, Spain, and South
America will be free : How many other States
will precede, and how many follow them, cannot
now be known ; but all Europe must do one or
the other. One principal occasional cause of
these revolutions, is the immense national debts
accumulated by the expensive wars of theprefent
century. Spain finds a deficiency of eighty mil
lions. The Emperor's dominions are exhausted
by war and taxes. No Sovereign in Europe can
iinpofe a new tax, without the consent of the peo
ple, for France could not do it. Spain must as
semble her Cortes, or submit to a bankruptcy,
either of which is the direcft road, and the firft,
the beaten road, to a revolution. Aflemblingthe
Notables here, has done the fame thing.
SPRINGFIELD, December 9.
IsaiAh Thomas Esq. Printer at Worcefter,hrm
lately iflued proposals for printing a large fami
ly BIBLE.âThis will be a great, expensive, but
trulyl andable & praiseworthy undertaking. The
abilities of this gentleman in his profeftioual ca
pacity are so generally known, that we cannot
admit a doubt of his success ill this important de
sign.
We learn from Dfcerfield, that on the 21ft ult.
the following accident happened there:âA gen
tleman belonging to New-Jersey, by the name of
Brightfton, returning home from a journey to
the northward, was unfortunately thro.wn from
his horse. His head firft meeting the ground, im
mediately deprived him of all sensation, and h<i
lay as it were breathless. Providentially Do<ftor
Cunningham of Hatfield rode up, according to
his conjecture about 20 minutes after the accident
rook place. He could not discover any visible
signs of life, but instantly bled him, and by iinart
frivftion, and the application of strong vinegar*
restored animation, and in about an hour put him
in a condition to renew his journey. What would
have been the confequenct of this gentleman's dis
aster, had he not received the seasonable aflift
ance he did, is uncertain ; but the warmelt thanks
are certainly due to the humane Dodtor for the
diligence with which he employed fuccefsful at
tempts for his reiteration.
THE GARDEN of the THUILLERIES.
r I "'HIS garden is the fineft, and molt frequent-
A ed walk in Paris. The parterres, the alleys,
the large basons of water, the statues of marble,
are allanfvverable to each other in their stile of
magnificence;
It was begun by order of Henry IV, in 1600, and
finifhed under Louis XIV, in 1660. It is 360 fa
thoms in length, and 68 broad , containing in the
whole 67 arpents of land.
There are seven entrances into this garden.â
The three principal alleys are 165 fathoms long;
and that in the middle is 1 5 fatnoms broad.
The great terras 011 the lide of the river, which
makes the principal ornament of the garden, ii
280 fathoms long, and 14 broad.
111 the whole garden are four fountains, two of
which have basons of a large circumference. On
the fide of the palace are six.statues, and two vases
of white marble- The statues are a hunter and
two huntrefles, a fawn, an Hamadriade, and the
goddess Flora.
R.ound the great bason of the parterre are four
groupes of marble figures: Thefirji represents
the rape of Orithia, or rather Time carrying off
Beauty ; the second is Ceres born away by Saturn,
under the figure of Time : the third, Lucretia stab
bing herfelf before Collatinui ; The fourth repre
sents JEneas, laden with his household gods, liia
father /Inchifes, and his foil Afcatiius.
In the semi-circle which forms the horse
there are four marble rivers, upon pedestals of the
fameâthe Loire, the Seine, the Nile, and the Ty
ber. The two last were copied at Rome, from
antiques, that arc to be seen in the Capitol.
At the end of the garden, between the openings
of the liorfe Ihoe, there are two figures on horse
back, of a prodigious magnitude, raised upon rus
tic piers ; they represent Mercury, and Fame.
Within a few years several statues, cut by the
ablest mailers in the time of Termes, have been
placed in this garden.
PRODIGIOUS STATUE.
IN the place of Louis XIV, in Paris, is eredied
his equestrian statue in bronze. The King is re
present ed in the dress of a hero of antiquity, with
out saddle or spurs.
The statue and horse are twenty-two feet two
inches high. The whole was cast at once, by Bal
thafar Keller, of Zurich in Switzerland. The
designs were by Girardon. Fourscore thousand
weight of metal was used in this work, which
cost two hundred thousand crowns.
A trial was made by which it appeared that
twenty persons migjitfit round a table in the bel
ly of the horse.
The pedestal upon which this horse stands is
thirty feet high, twenty-four long, and thirteen
broad.
NEW-YORK, DECEMBER 16.
The stupendous monuments of antiquity which
excite the admiration of modern times, ought an
the fame time to fill our hearts with gratitude to
heaven, for amending the condition of mankind,
infuch manner,that a few haughty despots do'not
command the wealth of the world, and the labor
of millions of slaves, by which means only, such
aftonilhing works could have been eredted.
How much better is it to employ the wealth of
this world in forming institutions for promoting
ufeful knowledge, and leflening the infelicities
I of existence, than tofuffer human vanity to eredt
monuments of pride and ambition, which Itamp
indelible infamy 011 the degraded character of the
age in which they are founded.

SIR, '
QUESTIONS twenty-second and twenty-third.
. " General Monk repaired the King's govern
" jnent in England : Might not one American Cette
" ra l or anither be able, by discontent o>- corruption,
" to do the fame ? IV ould the army follow his orders
" on fiich an occasion ? Could one or more politicians,
â ' through intrigues, undertake the fame with any
" hopes of Jucccfs, fbould even the army ajjifl him
" in such a cafe ?"
I have before observed, that no politicians, or
general officers, in America, have any such in
fluence. Neither the people nor the soldiers
would follow them. It was not attachment to
men, but to a cause, which firlt produced, and
supported the revolution : It was not attach
ment to officers, but to liberty, which made the
soldiers inlilt. Politicians in America can only
intrigue with the people : These are numerous,
andfo scattered, thatno ltatefman has any great
influence but in his own small circle. In courts
sometimes, gaining two or three individuals may
produce a revolution : No revolution in America
tan be accompliffied without gaining the majori
ty of the people ; and this not all the wealth of
Great Britain is able to do, at the expence of
their liberties.
Question twenty-four.â" The revolution mttft
" have made a great change in affairs, so that many
" people, though at present free of the enemy's incur
" /ions, have lojl their daily fubfjiencr. Have the
" occupations, which come injtead of their old ones,
" been fuffuient tofipply their wants ?"
All the difficulties which were ever apprehend
ed, of this fort are long since past. In 1774,
foin e were apprehensive that the filhermen,failors,
â¢and ffiipwrights would be idle : But some went
inco the army,fome into the navy, and some went
to agriculture ; and if there had been twice as
many, they would all have found employment.
The building of frigates and privateers has em
ployed all the carpenters. Manufactories, be.
fides, have been set up, of cannon, arms, pow
der, falt-petre, fait, flax and wool have been
raised in greater quantities, and coarse manufac
tures of cloth and linen been increased. In
ffiort, the greatest difficulty is, that there are not
hands enough. Agriculture alone, in that coun
try, would find employment enough for milli
ons, and privateering for thousands, more than
there are. I have the honor to be,

ANECDOTE.
the President of the United States, in
Â» v his lare tour,was at Lexington, viewing the
field where the firft blood was fhedin the late war ;
he with a degree of good humour, told his in
formant, and others that were present, that the
Britons complained to Dr. Franklin of the ill u
sage their troops met with at Lexington battle, by
the Yankies getting behind the stone walls, andfi
riTig at thera ; tlieDo<!lor replied, byalking them
whether there were not two fides to the wall.

THE Epilepsy, or Falling Sickness, being rec
koned in general, an incurable illftefs, a
! pliyiician of the firft eminence, who has been
! wirnefs to the convulsions of many poor creatures
; in our streets, liasrequelted us to publifli thefol
. lowing effectual remedy.
Take one drachm of fihe filings of true white
metal powder, or block tin powder, mix it with
a little conserve of oranges, or some sweet meat,
; give it to the patient the middle of the third day
before the full of the moon, and twelve hours
before the full, and also the middle of the third
day after the full of the moon. The fame me
thod is to be observed with refpetfi to the change
of that planet. Twelve doses thus given are ge
nerally fufftcient to effeifta cure. When the dif
eafeinvades, the fame dofeistobe given promis
cuously, which will have a remarkable effe<fl ;
but to obtaina complete cure, thefull and change
of the moon are to be observed.
As many people, of all ranks, are afflicfted with
this disorder, which exhibit such miserable (ymp
toms, it is consequently to be expecfted that they
will have recourle to so fiinple, so plain, and efR
-1 cacious a medicine, which is also afpecific in the
cure of the worms.
OF FRANCEâfrom Voltaire.
THE military afpecfl of Paris, is not, at this
time, more formidable than it was when
drawn forth by the faction of Cardinal de Retz,
on the arreil of Bouflel, and thedifperfon of the
other popular Magistrates, during Louis XlVth's
minority : And how that attempt of the people
was subdued, the following anecdote will explain :
The Parisians were formed in martial bodies,
and de Retz himfelf, had a corps, named the
Corinthian Regiment. Five hundred thousand
citizens were in arms, when the great Prince de
Conde marched to oppose thein with only 8000
men. The Parisians took the field, adorned with
feathers and ribbands. Their evolutions were
the jest of the diJciplined troops. They were
routed by the regulars ; and the regiment of
Corinth, having been beaten by a handful of
Co-nde's men, the defeat was called " The First
Efiflle to the Corinthians !"
