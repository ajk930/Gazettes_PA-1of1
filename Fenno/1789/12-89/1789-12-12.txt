" Hoitfji measures will be most apt, in the long run,
to gain the concurrence of the public opinion."
WE need not have recourfeto any abstraCt
notions of moral obligation to furnifh
a reason, why mankind have generally approved
of truth and fair dealing. Whatever may be the
original bias of the human heart with refpeet to
oood and evil, or whether it naturally has any
bias either way, is not material in elucidating the
subjeCt of this (peculation. It is fufficient for my
present purpofc to attend to fails, withoet look
ing into the origin of principles, or estimating
the merit of motives. On this ground, if 0:1 no
other, we may venture to pronounce that justice
and veracity allimilate Co rendily with the common
sentiments of men, that whoever, does not ob
serve these duties, hazards the loss of his influence
and In a tumultuous liate of fociety,it
is true, these virtues seem to be disregarded ; but
they will soon gain their accuitonied eltiination,
when order and tranquility are restored. It is
only in tliofe lituations, where people cannot re
flect calmly and a<ft soberly, that falfhood and in
jufticedo not meet with public indignation. De
clarations that are falfe, and aCtions that are un
juftmay allume such a difguift as to gain popular
approbation, under the idea that they are true
and juit. The opinions of men may be l'o distraCt
ed, and their tempers l'o agitated with new and
difficult circumstances, that they may be utterly
at a loss in what their duty or their interell con
lifts. Under such embarrassments, people com
mit errors, while they suppose they are aCting
wifely ; and fufpendthe practice of themoraldu
ties from an ignorance of the comprehenlive na
ture of morality. But as 110 society can be long
held together, in a state so convulsed as to difh
pate ider.sof moral rectitude, we mult conclude
that a restoration ofgovernment will awaken anew
the sentiments of moral obligation. There never
can be a long period when men can cease to per
form their obligations without sustaining private
inconvenience and public reproach. The exist
ence of society pre-fuppofes some controling in
fluence of virtuous attributes. Whether they are
the effect of fear of punifhnient, or Jove of duty, I
Itill call them virtuous, because they are ufeful.
If these reflections are just, they fliould infpireus
with caution againlt imbibing theopjnionsorimi
tating the aCtions of those who av*il tlieinfelves
of dilordered times to bewilder and pervert the
public ide * of veracity and justice.
The truth of 111 motto is amply illustrated in
the fate of the leading characters who have con
ducted us to independence and government. It
is worthy of remarkthat those men, who are now
held in veneration and employed in public ser
vice, are principally the men, who have all along
delivered the lame opinions, and recommended
the fame measures, that have finally coincided
with the public opinion. But when we look on
Ihe other hand, and behold characters of an op
pufue description, how are they negleCied and
fallen ! There was a time, when the friends of
disorder and injuflicÂ« beguiled the public mind
into a belief that they were the friends of freedom
and virtue. Such delusions however can never
have along continuance. Opinions, that cannot
bear the telt of a strict examination, much lels of
a fair experiment, mull be renounced, when the
people are left to cool reflection. Menaverfeto
good government can never long hold an ascen
dency in foeiety, unless the objects of human hap
ptnefs,and the feelings of the human heart under
go an alteration.
It Ihould encourage our patriots and legislators
toperfevere in a course ol honor andjultice, by
contemplating that they have gone through the
molt hazardous and difficult trials, to which our
affairs will probably be exposed. she objects of
lepiflatloH that will now rife into view are so great
and exienftve, that lioneft minds may be alarmed
Â«it their magnitude and variety. I hiscircumftunce
may deter some people from venturing to adopt
ihofe iyltems that wear the face of intrinsic pro
priety and excellence. When men have long been
uccultomed to temporary expedients and partial
arrangements they cannot at once collect fortitude
to embrace measures, that fliall have a general,
permanent operation. But itmult be concluded
that plans founded in wifdoni are not to be reject
ed because they are great; and those founded in
lioneity should be recommended, notwithftandiiig
they may be new.

EXTRACTS from the ADDRESS of the firft PRES
BYTERY of the EaJlivarJ,
To GEORGE WASHINGTON, President of
the United States.
SIR,
" t ' le ministers and ruling ciders, dele
gated to reprefeiit the churches in Mas
sachusetts and New-Hamplhire, which compose
rhe h irlt Prelbytery of the Ealtward, now hold
ing a ltated feflion in this town, beg leave to ap
proach your presence with genuine feelings oft he
deepest veneration and higiiellefteem.
" In unison with rejoicing millions we felici
tate our country, and ourselves, on your unani
mous election to the highest office a nation can
beltow ; and on your acceptanceof the truft,with
every evidence, which a citizen can give, of be
ing actuated thereto by the purefl principles of
patriotilm, of piety and of felf-denial.
" Great was the joy of our hearts to fee the
late tedious and deftruclive war at length termi
nated, in a fair and honorable peaceâto fee the
liberty and independence of our country happily
securedâto fee wife conftitutionsof civil govern
ment peaceably eltablifhed in the several Statesâ
and especially to fee a confederation of them all,
finally agreed on by the general voice.
" But, amid all our joys, we ever contemplated
with regret the want of efficiency in the federal
government: ; we ardently wished for a form of
NAtjONiL union, which ihould draw the cord of
amity more closely around the several Statesâ
which should concentrate their interests, and re
duce the frcemewof America to one great body,
ruled by one head, and animated by one foul.
" And, now, we devoutly offer our humble tri
bute of praise and thankfgiviÂ«g to the all-graci
ous Father or lights, who has inspired our
public councils with a wisdom and firmnefs which
have effectc 1 that desirable purpose, in so great
a ineafurc, by the National Conjlitution ; and who
has fixed the eyes of all America on you, as the
worthiest of their citizens, to be entrulted with
the execution of jt.
" Whatever any have fuppoled wanting in the
original plan, we are happy to fee so wifely pro
viding in its amendments : and it is with peculiar
fat is faction that we behold, lioweafily the entire
confidence of the people, in the man who fits at
the helm of government, has eradicated every
lemaining objection to its form.
" Anion;; these we never considered the want
of a religious test, that grand engine of perfe
ction in every tyrant's hand : But, we should
not have been alone in rejoicing, to have seen
some explicit acknowledgement of the only true
God and Jesus Christ whotnhe hath sent, insert
ed, somewhere, in the Magna Charta of our
country."
" Under the nurturing hand of a ruler, of
such virtues, and one so deservedly revered by
all ranks, we joyfully indulge the hope, that
virtue and religion will revive and flourifliâthat
infidelity, and the vices ever attendant in its train,
will be baniflied every polite circleâand that
national piety will soon become fafhionable there,
and from thence be diffufed among all ranks in
the community."

THE ANSWER.
gentlemen,
THE affectionate welcome, which you are
pleased to give ine to the ealtern parts of
the'Unioii, would leave me without excuse, did
I fail to acknowledge the sensibility which itawa
kens ; and to exprel's them oft sincere return, that
a graceful sense of your goodness can suggest.
To be approved by the praise-worthy, is a wish
is natural to becoming ambition as its confe
rence is flattering to our felf-love.
lam, indeed, much indebted to the favorable
sentiments, which you entertain towards me, and
it will be my study to defervc them.
The tribute of tliankfgiving,which you offer to
thegracious Kather of lights, for his inspi
ration of our public councils with wisdom and
firmnefs to complete the national constitution, is
worthy of men, who devoted to the pious purpo
ses of religion, desire their accomplifliment by
such means as advance the temporal happiness of
their fellow men. And, here, I am persuaded,
you will perniic me to observe, that the path of
true piety is so plain as to require but little poli
tical direction.
To this consideration we ought to ascribe the
ablence of any regulation refpecfting religion
from the Magna Charta of our country. To the
guidance of the ministers of the Gospel, this im
portant object .is, perhaps, more properly com
mitted. It will be your care toinftruifttheignc
rant, and to reclaim the devious : And in the
progrcfj of morality and fcicncc, to which our
[ Publifki+? on Wediisfday and Saturday
government will oive everv furtherance, we may
~ " 7 â¢
confidently expert the advancement of true reli
gion, and the completion ot' our happiness.
I pray the munificent Rewarder of Virtue, that
your agency in this good work may receive its
compensation here and hereafter.

FURTHER ACCOUNT OF THE PROCEEDINGS
OF FRANCE.
WHEN the Hotel de Villc was plundered on
Monday, the women, who were the full to
force it open, found means in the course of the
short time they were there, to plunder the Trea
furyCheftof 200,000 livres ; half of which being
in bills, was afterwards recovered, the reft was
divided among the plunderers. This forcible
entrance was fortunately made so early in the
morning that none of tlie Magistrates were as
sembled; they might othervcilc have probably
been conducted to the gallows, which had been
erected very early in the morning to be ready on
any occasion.
Though the national guard was aflembled be
fore the Mansion House in great numbers at the
time it was forced, they did not offer to make the
leall resistance to the women, but fuffered them
to plunder, while they looked 011 as unconcerned
spectators. Besides the money, it was here the
women furnifhed themselves with the fire arms;
and weapons, with which they afterwards march
ed to Versailles.
Some of the populace headed by the women,
attempted to set fire to the Hotel de Ville ; the
intended conflagration was, however, prevented
by a youth who, at the imminent hazard of his.
life rushed forwards, and in a molt furprifirtg
manner extinguished the flame which had juf'c
caught the building.âOn being desired by some:
Members of the National Assembly to demand a
reward for his services and intrepidity, he nobly
refufed all pecuniary com penfation, and request
ed only that he might have the honor of having
his name enrolled in the Paris militia.
[We have given various accounts of the late Com
motions at Versailles : The following appears
to be wrote with candor ; and if true, thetran
fadtion which it relates, turns out to be an ac
cidental bulinefs, rather than a precipitate de
velopement of a deep-laid design to defeat the
patriotic plans of the National Aflemblyâand
restore the government of France to its former
despotic state.]
The following account of what pafled at the En
tertainment given by the Life Guards to the
Flanders regiment, may be depended upon, as
it is given by an officer who was one of the
guests ;
" The Life Guards sent invitations not only to
the officers of the Regiment de Flandre, and of
the Regiment de Montmorency (dragoons) but
alfoto those of the Versailles militia. The tables
were spread on the stage of the Opera house inthe palace. While the gueils were at table, the
officer who far at the head of it, informed the
company that his Majesty hearing that his guards
were to hive the honor of entertainingtlie officers
of the different military corps at Versailles, had
hunted the day before, and ordered that as much
of the game that had been killed, as might be
thought Sufficient, fhonld be sent in his name to his
guards, to enable them the better to entertain
their guests. That part therefore of the enter
tainment he said they owed to his Majesty's boun
ty. This was conlidered by the whole company
as a mark of amiable condescension in bis Majesty,
for which they expretfed their grateful acknow
ledgments. Several loyal and patriotic toalls
â were given, and at the head of them, the Kingâ
the Queen âthe Dauphinâthe Nation.
" Many jovial songs were sung, and the com
pany were juli on the point of breaking up in good
humor, extremely Satisfied with their entertain
ment, and without faying a word about politics,
or. public n(Fairs, when the King, the Queen, and
the Dauphin, made their appearance in the am
phitheatre, in one of the boxes, with a view to
enjoy the novel fight of a repas mi/itaire.
" Asi'oonasthe company perceived the Royal
Visitors, who had thus honored them with their
presence. Count d'Eftaing, the Marquis deLufig
nan, and Count de Montmorency, advanced all
three to the front of the Itage, each with abump
er in h's hand, and bowing most refpecftfully to
their Majesties and the Dauphin, drank off their
glafles, without faying any thing, and leaving it
to theirMajefties toguefs from thecircutnftances,
that those three noblemen had done thetnfelves
the honor of drinking their Majesties health,and
that of the Heir Apparent.
" The other guests, however, were not silent
they Ihouted applaule, and made the theatre ring
with repeated cries of Vive le RoiâVive la Reine
Vive !c Dauphin.
" Upon t his, foine of the young officers taking
a bottle of wine and a glass, leaped over the 01"
cheftra, climbed tip into the boxes, and approach
ing the King, humbly entreated his Majesty to do
them the honor of taking a glass of wine. The
King took the glass with great complacency, and
bowed graciously to the company, drank to the
health of all present. The lhouts of Vive le Roi
were then renewedâand thpn it was the mulic
Struck up,
Oli " ifhari!âOli mnn Roi !"
" The Queen's sensibility was affected by all
these circnmftances,and fheburft into tears. Upon
this his Majesty taking her with one hand, and his
son with the other, immediately withdrewâa
crowd of officers got round him, and attended
him to the door of the royal apartment.
" It was after that, the officers pulled the Na
tional cockades from their hatsâbut so little was
this preconcerted or forefeen, that very few of
them could at that time procure black cockades
to replace them."
On Monday His Excellency the French Ambas
sador received an express from Paris, to acquaint
him that the reports of Several Noblemen havinr
been killed, were wholly untrue. It likewise
makes mention, that the city of Paris was tolera
bly qnie. all Thursday, ow'ing partly to a consi
derable arrival of corn in the morning, which
had given the people great Every
neceflary precaution is likewise taken to prevent
an infurrecftion, by a double guard being placed
all over the city.
The Servants of Paris have resolved to raise for
the public use, the Sum of one million of livres
or about forty thousand guineas.
Letters from Paris, received on Thursday, state
that Count d'Eftaing and the Duke of Brifack
have been arrested.
F.xtrafl of a letter Jrotn Vienna, August i 9.
" Letters from Conftantinopleofthe Btli of Tulv
mention the efcapeof a Chevalier Lombard, who
was taken by the Turks in the beginning of the
war, and the Potte being informed of the value
set on his abilities by Ruflia, have conftantlv re
fll fed every offer of ransom made by the court of
Peterfburgh for that officer. His escape has so irri
tated the Porte, that they have banished the Ter
zana-Emifti, who is accused of negligence, and
have replaced him by a very a<ftiveÂ°aiul rigorous
fuccefTor, who Ims begun-by doubling the chains
of all the Ruffian and Austrian prisoners. It is
even said, that in coiifequence of this event the
Ruffian A mbalfadors, confined in the Seven Tow
ers, has heen shut up closer than before ; but this
report wants confirmation, as other letters from
that place make no mention of that circumstance.
OF SILAS DEAN.
The situation of Silas Dean, at Brtifiels, dur
ing the latter end of the American war, was lit
tle better than starving; for he durst not go to
France, America, nor England, and he declared
that Congress were in his debt sixteen thousand
pounds. His situation in England has been since
worse than in Bruflels, for here he literally ftarv.
Ed, and would have died for want, had notaoen
tieman of fafhion been an eye witness, that he
not only wanted food, but a bed to lie upon. A
eolledtion of about 70 pounds, was then made for
him, and with that supply lie got on ship board,
with an intention to return to America as his der
nier resource. On board this veflel he died.
EXEMPLARY PATRIOTISM.
The pecuniary presents lately made to tlie
French National Assembly have been great,and are
increafingdaily. The Duke of Orleans has given
2,soo,ooolivres; M.Neckar 100,000 livres ; l'Abbe
de S. Non, 4000 livres, one moiety of his abbey ;
M. Nicola,Prefident of the Cliambredes Comptes,
resigned a pension of 10,000 livres, and gave
25,000; M. d? Atigre, a refugee, in England,
100,000 crowns. jhe Invalid guards though
poor, presented 300 livres ; the Canons of St. Gen
vive sent to the mint a silver chandelier, thefin
neft, perhaps, in France, its weight 248 marks,
of 8 ounces each. The Company of Booksellers
gave 20,000 livres ; the Patriotic Society of Ver
sailles gave 88,000 livres ; A private soldier of
the Paris militia 318; M. Tvigaud, 1000 ; the pu
pils of an Accadeiny, 1400. &c. A lady of easy
virtue, sent i2,ooolivres, with tliefollowing note,
" Gentlemen, 1 have a heart formed for love. J

Accounts were received here this morning, that

they would probably have succeeded, had it not
been for the spirited efforts of a battalion of the

Ext raft of a letterfrom a gentleman in New-Jerfcj,
vjho t)as lately returned from an excurfieri to the
We fern Country, to his friend in this city, datti
November 10 th.
" Th e design of this letter is to give a short
account of the riling of the waters in Lake
Ontario, which, from their continual advances,
have alarmed the inhabitants around its borders
to a great degree, Several buildings which stood
at a convenient distance from its ancient bounda
ries, now Hand seven feet in the water. All the
low meadows made round about it, are now part
of the lake, and roads where cattle, horses and
men travelled 18 months ago, are now only pal
fable tor boats. The last information I had, was
from a man of integrity, who receives letters
from his son at Niagara upon this fubjeit. In his
last letter he informed him, that a brew lioufe
which stood on the bank ot the Lake is now render
ed useless, from its second story being under
water.
''I have supposed that the waters of Lake Erie,
(which lie near three hundred feet above those
ot Ontario) have founded a pafTage among the
rocks under ground to the Lake of Ontario. If
this should be the cafe, the waters of Ontario
will rife to a level with those of Lake Erie."

A slave to fafhion isainoft paflive animalâit is
acted upon by an agent more fickle than the wind
âand it it can be laid to have a mind, it is apily
described in the following lines,
" Dull is lighter than a leather,
" And the wind, more light than cither;
'â¢ But a foppifh, fickle mind,
" Is lighter far than feather, dud or wind."
The usurpations of fafhion are obvious in every
rank of society : They descend into the humble
abodes of poverty, as well as claim the supreme
direction in the elevated walks of life.
The Buckle that hides the Ihoe, and the coat
without a back, are not confined to any class of
citizensâand fafhion is the word, whether the
cap is made of kenting, or of inuflin at a guinea
a yard.
Following the fafhion, however, is sometimes
attended with disagreeable consequences: Ayoung
man loft the labor of application and attendance
for an eligible situation in an eminent mercantile
house, merely by being two falhionable in his ap
pearanceâthe principal of the house having turn
ed almost to a Quaker in his dress, observed that
he did not like those knights if the buckl;. And a
very worthy friend of the author's, was prevent

whooblcured her many accomplifhincnts, by dis
covering too strong a propensity to follow the ex
ceiles ol the mode : Amelia, laid he, is a fine fi
gure of a womanâher countcnanre is lovely, and
jae has an ingenious, sprightly mindâbut, I can
not suppose that a husband, children, or family,
will ever be offo much confequenee to her, as
the ornamenting her person, and always appear
ing as a model to the falhionable world but the
expencc ! ah, there's the rub ! the Indies have
been drained to fatisfy the cravings of falhion
and still flie cries for more !â' For though nature
is contented with littleâ yet fancy is boundless.'
The folio-wing Ohfsrvations on the great importance,
and utility of Newspapers, are extra (led from
the JirJl number of THE WESTERN STARâ
a paper publifoed by Mr. Loring Andrews, at
Stockbridge, MaffachuTi.tls.
IT is owing in a great degree to the want of in
formation, that the people are so often suspi
cious of their rulers, and entertain the idea that
the interest of the people and the interest of the
government is unconnected ; and that the latter
have no object but to aggrandize themselves, ac
quire unlimited power, and lay heavy burdens
upon their constituents, which they themselves
mean not to feel the weight of. Restless and dis
appointed men, out ofotfice, ever propogate such
ideas ; and so long as the people at large, or any
number of then-, ground their opinions npon
verbal reports, they will be likely to remain in
a state of uneafinels with regard to their liberties
and properties. Every man who feels interested
in his own fate, and the fate of his offspring
should search for himself, and instead of
â alking his informant, " Are these things so," he
should apply to the NEWSPAPER, the faithful
register of thetranfactionsof the day ; its pages
teltify concerning public men and public mea
sures. If the rulers of the people act uprightly,
study the interest of their constituents, and con
fillt the good of the great whole, thepeople will
reft fatisfied ; if iliey know it, and the true and
onlyfure channel ihi ough which this information
can be gained, is a NEWSPAPER. If Rulers
err, the peoplefhottld know of their mifcr-nduct,
which will ever be painted in its true colours by
the impartial Editor of a Newspaper, andimpai
tial every Editor ought certainly to be, for,
if patronized by the people, much is entt ulted to
him, felf interest, if no other motive flimulates,
andmuft induce an Editor of a NEWSPAPER to
found an alarm when danger is at hand, for the
deftrucftion of a i ree will be the firft oS-
jecfc with men determined to enslave tlieir fellow
citizens. Such determinations, however, will
never be formed, while the people continue watch
ful of their rights, attentive to the proceedings
of government, and liberal patrons of the arts,
"Among whicha free press holds adiftino-uifli
ed rank." Â°

NEW-YORK, DECEMBER 12.
The repairs and improvements now carrying
on in this city, are highly honorary to the patri
otifin and public. spirit of the citizens at large,
who cheerfully submit to the heavy contributions
neceflary to defray such expencesâat the fame
time they evince that our civil officers are actuated
by a laudable zeal for the conveniency of the in
habitants, and the dignity of the Seat of our Na
tional Government.
As the hopes of the pajjing age are always on the
rising generation, it is a fubjeft of serious impor
tance that they fliould enjoy such advantages in
point of education, as will uflier them into life,
so accompliffied, as that they may excel, if possi
ble, their predeceflors, in every attainment that
may conduce to their pcrfonal happiness, and the
public prosperity.
This city is now the Seat of the National Go
vernment âevery wife and benevolent inflitution
fliould be cftabliflied, which may tend to procras
tinate the period, when it may bethought neces
sary to take another residence. Perhaps nj city
can boalt a superior policeâflill the power of
prejudice may sometimes prove paramount to le
gal reflraintsâbut however flrong the force of
habit may be, there is one plan that may be adopt
ed,which will in it's effeifts, contiibute to the most
cordial acquiescence in every wife and salutary
public regulation ,â¢ and that is, the inflitution of
public schools, at the public expence, to which
all ranks and denominations of children may
have free access : Againfl such an inflitution it is
notpollible that a prejudice can exist in the mind
of any man, who ever felt a spark of benevolence
towards his fellow creatures. What are all the
external ornaments that art can bestow to embel
lish a city, compared with the beauties of a well
regulated Society ! Peace and good order are the
attendants on knowledge and information More
than half the evils we fuffer spring from ignor
ance. The great body of citizens is formed of
the middling and lower clafles of people : Let
them be inspired with high notions of freedom,
and at the fame time be kept in ignoranceâand
the work of government will be rendered an at*
duous, and difficult talkâit will be utterly im-
to maintain peace and good order, with
out being tyrannicalâbut if to tiie bleflings of
freedom, you add those of education, submission
to government will be the result of sentimentâ
the people, imderftanding their true interests,
will fee that liberty and licentiousness are diftintft
ideasâand that the security of freedom consists in
obedience to the laws. When the public tran
quility is founded on tlicfe principles, it is not lia
ble to shocks and fluctuationsâevery resident is
inspired with confidence in his personal security
the administration of public business is prose
cuted with spirit and dignityâcommerce and arts
flourifh, and the whole face of affairs aflumes a
pleasing and encouraging afpert. Expence in
curred on such an occasion, is the most provident
economy.
In the late commotion at Kartinico, a regiment
of Mohittoes remained attached to the Governor.
One of their officers having infultcd a citizen, be
cause he wore a national cockade, the yellow
gentleman waÂ« taken by tliepopulace, and hanged
at the gates of the Government lioufe.
The principal planters in the .State of Georgia
have eftabliffied a society for promoting agricul
ture, and other rural concerns. Every nijiitu
tionofthis kind has an auspicious afpefl on the be ft in
terests of o'ir country : Societiei formed in the extreme
parts of the Union will have opportunities of exploring
the particular capacities of the foils under different cli
mates, and more effeCluatly ajcertain the rcfources
which we enjoy, or may create among otirfelves, to

It having been mentioned in one of the papers
of this city that the " Beacon, or Light" at the
entrance of Befton harbor was blown down, in a

Not the Light-House, which is built of (tone, and
founded on a rock, ,but limply a wooden beacon,

SIR,
QUESTION twentieth.â" Have there not been
, different opinions in Congress, with regard to
" this (i. e. topropofats appearing fair, which were
" not Jo,) Jrom whence animojities have arisen ?"
There Jias never been any difference of fenti
menc in Congress, since the declaration of In
dependency, concerning any proposals of recon
ciliation. There have been no proposals of re
conciliation made lincc the 4th of July, 1776,
excepting twice.
The fir It was made by Lord Howe, who, together
with his brother, the General, were appointed
by the King, commiflioners for some purpose or
other. The public has never been informed what
powers they had. Lord Howe lent a meflage by
General Sullivan to Congress, desiring a confer
ence with some of" its members. There were
different sentiments concerning the propriety of
fending any members, until we knew his lord,
fliip's powers. A majority decided to fend, Dr.
Franklin, Mr. John Adaius, and Mr. Rutledge,
were sent. Upon their report, there was a pcr
feift unanimity of fentinient in Congress.
The second was the million of Lord Carlisle,
Governor Johnfton, and Mr. Eden, in 1778.
Upon this occasion again there was a perfedl un
animity in Congress.
Before the declaration of Independency, Lord
North moved several conciliatory proportions in
parliament, in which a good deal of art was em
ployed to seduce, deceive, and divide. But there
was always an unanimity in Congress upon all
these plans.
There was different opinions concerning the
petition to the King, in the year 1 775 ; and be
fore that, concerning the non-exportation agree
ment. There have been different opinions con
cerning articles of the confederation ; concern
ing the bell plans for the condtul of the war ;
concerning the best officers to conduct them ;
concerning territorial controversies between par
ticular States, &c. but these differences of opinion,
which are cflential to all assemblies, have never
caused greater animosities than those which arise
in all aflemblies, where there is freedom of
debate.

S 1 R,
QUESTION twenty-firft.â" Are there no mal
, " contents in America, again/} the government,
" â  who are otherwise much inclined for the American
" catfe, who may force the nation, or Congress, a
" Â£ a '"ft 'h'tr resolutions and interejts, to conclude a
" peace ?"
There is no party formed in any of the Thirteen
States against the new conftittnion, nor any op
position against the government, that I have ever
heard of, excepting in Pennfylvania,and in North-
Carolina. These by no means deserve to be coin
pared together.
In Pennsylvania there is a refpedtable body of
people, who arc zealous against Great-Britain,
but yet wish for some alterations in their new
form of government : yet this docs not appear
to weaken their exertions ; it seems rather to
exite an emulation in the two parties, and to in
crease their efforts.
I have before explained the hiltory of the rife
and progress of the party, in North-Carolina, con
lifting of Regulators and Scotch Highlanders ;
and General Howe has informed you of their
fate. This party has ever appeared to make
North-Carolina more staunch and decided, instead
of weakening it.
The party in Pennsylvania will never have an
inclination to force the Congress, against their
interests, to make peace ; nor would they have
the power, if they had the will.
The party in North-Carolina, whose inclinati
on cannot be doubted, is tooinconfiderableto do
any thing.
I have the honor to be,
