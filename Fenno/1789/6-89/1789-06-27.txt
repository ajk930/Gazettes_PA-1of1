it difqualifies them for acftive pursuits in life.

SKETCH OF PROCEEDINGS OF 1 CONGRESS.
In the Houfc UNITED STATES
Thursday, June 18, 1789.
The question. Whether the Setretary of Foreign AJfairs Jhould he
re moveable by the President? still under consideration.
Mr. White. This question has occasioned a solemn debate,,
tho' some gentlemen have confidcred it so clear or so trivial as to
excite their surprise, that it has again been brought before the
house. I consider it as the moil important question that has been
yet considered ; the molt important that I ever had a voice in dif
ufling or a vote in determining, except that of adopting the constitu
tion itlelf in the convention of Virginia. I confidcr the day on which
the sense of the house is to be taken on this fubjeft as a memorable
day in the annals of America. Sir, Ido not consider it is limply
whether the power (hall be vested in the President, or in the Preli
rtent and Senate, The constitution has determined that point.
Nor do I consider the question to be whether offices are to be
held during good behaviour, or at the pleasure of thtfe who ap
point them. I suppose that on a fair and necessary confti utlion oi
the constitution, that matter is fettled. All arguments tending to
(how that one or the other mode ot appointment or removal, is pro
per or improper, or that they ought to be difpatced by impeach
ment, are inapplicable to the present cafe. But the refpeÂ£tabflity
ot the characters who support these arguments entitle them to
notice.
I shall procecd, Sir, to enquire, whether we are bound by the
constitution, or whether we may grant to others, or aliume to our
lelves, powers which the constitution has not given in exprels
terms, or by necessary implication? This I conceive to be the
qutftion.
It is not contended that the power proposed to be vested in the
Prelident is given him in express terms, or thatit can be inferred
from any particular clause of the constitution. It is fought for
from another source, the general nature of executive power; it is
011 this principle the clause is advocated, or I mistake the gentle
man's argument. It was said by the gentleman, who opened
the debate in opposition to this amendment, that the constitution
having vested the President with a general executive power, the're
by allthofe powers werevefted which were notexprefsly excepted,
and therefore he possessed the power ot removal. Sir, this is not
to be learned in the American governments. Each state has an ex
ecutive magifti ate ; but look at his powers and I believe it will not
be found that he has, in anyone, the right of appointing or remov
ing officers. In Virginia I know that all the great officers are
appointed by the General Ailembly. Tlr.s is generally the fact in
other states. If then the doCtrine of the gentleman is to be tup
ported by examples, it mult be by thoft brought from beyond the
AtlanticâWe must also therelook for rules, by which the executive
power, in the latitude of this principle, may be circumscribed, if
indeed it can be limited. Upon this principle,fir, the fame power
is given to thekgiflaturrâthey will poflefsall powers not express
ly excepted. If the President has all executive powers which are
no,t expressly excepted, I do not know that there can be a more
arbitrary government. The President, I conceive, will have all the
power ot a monarch ; and the legiflatureall the powers of the most
sovereign legislation. This I take to be a clear and necessary de
duction from the principle on which the clause in the bill is
founded- The President is limited in the appointment of ambaf
ljdors,confuls, judges,and all other officers, and in making treaties.
In these he is expressly limited, and no turther. Take from him
these, and give him all other executive powers, as exercited in
â¢ monarchy, and fee what they will be. There are a!fo eXcep
t '.oivs *o the legislative power ; tuch as that thev shall not tor a time
prohibit the importation of slaves; that direct taxes (hall not be
i-i id, but in a certain mode ; that taxes (hall be uniform ;
'.it *.h( 'v shall grant no titles ot nobility, &c. Ihefe are the
1 xcepti.ins to the legislative : Now givethem all the powers of the
parliament of Great-Aritein, and what kind of government will
you have ? I can not describe it. It appears to me absolute and
a$ extentive as any despotism.
It you go once beyond the boundaries of the constitution where
ran you draw a line with any precision ? and with what fafety to
liberty canthe doctrine of thisclaufe be tupported. I understand
our system different in its form and !pir:t from all other govern
ments in the world. It is in part national and partly federal ; and
though it is moreextenfivc in its powers than most other confedera
ted governments, vet the Congrcfs is not to be compared to nati
onal k giflatures.âTo these, general powers aregranted, some with
and some without any particular reservations in tavour of the body
of the people'; and to those only will the gentleman's reasonings
apply.âHere is no analogy.âThis is * government constituted
for particular purposes only ; and the Dowers which the people
have thought proper to grant are tpecifically enumerated, and dis
posed of among the various branches, if thete powers are inef
ficient, or if they are improperly difttibuted, it is not our tauh,
nor within our power to remedy. âThe people must grant further
power ;âorganize those already granted in a more perteÂ£t mannei,
or fuilcr from the deteCt. Wc can neither enlarge nor modity
them.
vSir, this was the ground on which the friends of the govern
ment have fupportrd it ;it was a fate ground,and I venture to la\
that it would not have been tupported on any other. In the State
from which I came, it its advocates had not maintained this prin
ciple, it would never have been ratified.
Mr. White then read a part of the ratification by Virginia, in
support of this afTertion.
Sir, said he, how far the eftabli'hment of the principle con
tended for may affect the completion of our Union, I will not
undertake to fay : I will only remark that the State of North-Ca
rolina has exprefled nearly the fame ientynents as Virginia,
this difference, that Carolina would not adopt the constitution tnl
it was Satisfied of this principle, that we could not by construc
tive aÂ£ts enlarge our powers, in order at a future day to dellioy
the State governments, and with them the liberties ot the people,
Sir, I could likewifc fugged to gentlemen the local situation ot
that country. It is contiguous to kentuckey, which united to
Carolina, form a territorv of amazing extent from the Atlantic to
the banks of the Ohio. 'The people qf this trad are in such a situ
ation as that, a single spark from this house would kindle a flame
which it would be difficult if not impoflible to extinguifli ; and
excite such a dread as would render them utterly irreconcilcable
to our government.
Sir, this is not a vain because the oppofers of the
constitution founded their arguments upon itâThey contended
that you would make conftruitions in your favor, and atTume
powers not intended to be vested in you by the people. I with,
Sir, my apprehensions may be ill founded, and contradicted by
the.event. The measure proposed, I acknowledge, is advocated
by refpi ftnble friends to the Union within these doors, and by
many without. But I believe much of this arifesfrom the clause
in question conferring the power on a m an > whom all the world
admires, and who they kilowwill not abufeit. But, Sir, on this
occasion I forget who is President ; but I do not # forget that the
worst of precedents are often cftablifhed in the best of turns. We
may give the power to a particular man in office, because he will
not abHie it: but we cannot take away that power from those who
[Published on IV td/iefday and Saturday.]
may fuccced him. Ido not mean to irifer from this, thai if the
constitution had vested the power in the President, it would be
improper he should have it. That is a question which I will not
undertake to determine. It is unneccflary ; the true question be
fore us being (imply a constitutional one.
Without entering into a detail of the evili that may arise, as
gentlemen have df>ne on both fides of the Houfej let us consider
whether the greater evil will rtot arise from our explaining the con
stitution at this time; Is there any neceflity for it ? If the condi
tion has given the power to the President, can he not exercise it
without our paflingan a&on the fubjett ? Will not the clause be
useless ? It the constitution has not given it him, shall we go be
yond the limits that are set usjin order to extend it to him ? I hope
not. But it seems to be a doubtful point : Some think he has
the power ; others not. Then, Sir, I would leave the construc
tion to himfelf. If it should become necefTary to exercise the
power, let him do it : The Occasion for the exercise of it will be
a better comment than any we can giveâlt will better explain it
o the people, and reconcile them to it more perfectly than any
law from the legislature*
It the neceflity of the cafe compel him td exercise the power,
even if wrong, the people will acquiesce. I will give you an ex
ample, Sir: In Virginia, when the operations of the war requir
ed exertions ot the chief magistrate, beyond the authority of the
law, our late governor Nelson, wliofe name must be dear to eve
ry triend to liberty, was obliged to iflue his warrants and impress
supplies for the army. Though it was known that he exceeded
his authority,- his warrants were executed ; his country was be
nefited by this resolute measure, and he himfelf afterwards in
demnified by the legiftature. Sir, I do not wish to encourage
adts of this kind, but I lay it Would be better for the executive to
assume the exercise of such a power on extraordinary occasions,
than tor us to delegate to him an extraordinary power to be cx
ercifed on all occasions;
Some gentlemen have supposed that the constitution has made
no provilion for the removal of officers; and they have called it
an omitted caie, and a detect. They ask, if we inay not supply
that defetk ? I answer, no. For if we can make any pofltble al
teration, we may go on and make the constitution just what we
please. But as a further anfvrer, I fay, it is not an omitted cale.
F r the constitution havingdirefctcd by whom officers lhall be ap
pointed, it does diredl alio by whom they (hall be removed. Ti.at
doctrine was so well supported by a gentleman yefterdav, that I
will not repeat. Sir, this must have been in the contemplation ok
the gentlemen who formed the constitution. Is it probable that
ihey never thought about the maimer in which an officer should
be displaced ? When they provided that the judges ihould hold
their offices during good behaviour, did they not intend that all
others should be held during pleasure ? It is not then an omitted
cafe.
Gentlemen have supposed that the Prefid<*it may suspend, an.d
that as he has a right to make a temporary ippointment, he has
also a right to make a temporary removal. 1 think he has so, as
it is correspondent with his power of appointing. But it has been
said that it the concurrence of v the Senate is ncceffary, they may
retufe to concur when a removal is necefTary.- Sir, it you are toÂ»
suppose that ihe government cannot be executed in its piefent
form, there is no leinedy for such a misfortune; but we arc not
to luppoie itâWe are to presume that the Senate will do their du
ty âYou may go on without end in supposing. You may lup-*
poÂ£e that the JPrefident may not do what is rigntâYou may even
suppose that this House will not do what is rightr What is the
contequcilce ? Why, our constituents must bear with us nil they
have an opportunity for a remedy. But ihall we* becarufe the
Senate may do wrong, give the Present a power ta att without
them. We may as well, Sir, if the Senate retufe to concur m a
favorite bill ot this Houle, proceed to pass the law without them.
But it has been asked, whether a person in the elevated station ot*
Piefident would probably abuse histruft? I presume he will not j
neither do I ptefuine the Senate wilL
A gentleman, Sir, in order to get over the obje&ions made toÂ»
the clause, had recurred to that part of the constitution, which
lays, that Congress may bylaw vest the appointment ot inferior
officers iu the President, in the courts of law, or heads of depart
ments, and has interred that he is to be considered himfelt the
head and center of all those departments. This comes from one
whom I always hear with pleasure, on account of his found rea
son and perspicuity of exprcflion, But, Sir, I must differ with
him. Who are the heads of departments? We have a secretary
for foreign affairs; another of the treasury, <scc, Now are not
these the principal officers in thofo departments f If they arc, they
are the heads. Who are the inferor officers ? The chief clerks,
and all who may depend upon them. The gentlemen who form
ed the constitution would not, it seems, give to the President
at all events the power of appointing these inferior officers to
which that of removal is attached.
Sir, when I set out with faying that the constitution is the pre
cise limit to the deliberations of this body, it may, at fir ft view,
appear 111 onfiftent with what I have said refpeÂ£ling conftru&ioos,
But, Sir, I fay that when a thing is granted in general terms, that
which in its own nature is attached to it, must go with it, with
out particular explanation. Without this principle, Congrefi*
could not execute the fy(lein. To make this clear, the conltitu
tion authorises the government to appoint supreme and inferior
judges. By natural and necessary conllruttion therefore, the le
gislature may fay, how many judges there shall be; how often
and where they shall hold their terms, and what their salaries
Ihallbe. These are natural and fafe conftru&ions âButconftruc-
tions of every other kind are beyond the limits of the constitution.
Sir, I shall trouble the committee no longer. I should not
perhaps have troubled them so long ; but on a matter of such great
importance, one which lies so heavy on my mind, and for which
I am so anxiously concerned, I could not avoid exprefling my
sentiments fully. lam, Sir, ftiongly impressed with the idea,
that the giving powers, which are not within the letter of the
constitution, will be to the people a circumftancc of alarm and
terror. [Daily Ad.~\
Mr. Pace observed, that he had quite different ideas upon the
clause in debate from gentlemen who supposed that it would en
creafe the refpoufibility of the PresidentâHe conceived that ma
king the heads ot departments dependent on him, would in a
great measure, destroy that refponhbilityâlt would encreafe
the number of his dependants who would all be interested in sup
porting his admiijiftration, whether according to the principle*
of the constitution or notâand thus he would be hedged in on
every fideâand what then becomes of his refponhbility i The
clause of the constitution which provides that officers shall be
removed for high crimes and misdemeanors, plainly includes all
those officers and crimes which it is contended for, to make the
President the sole judge of.âThe Senate is the bulwark of the so
vereignty of the StatesâThey ought not only to have a voice in
the framing laws, but ought also to Ice to the execution of those
laws.
The retaining this clause in the bill, will excite tenfold cla
mours for amendmentsâlt will be confidercd as making; the
President an independent monarch.
Mr. SsdcwicK: It is contended, that this question is already
fettled by the constitutionâThat the power which gives, is the
only power tovake away, is true, if the delegation of power sup-poses all that which is requisite to the acquifnion of the object oT
the power. It has been contended on one iide,but is not conceded
on the other; that the power of is not veiled in
the Senate. I hat the Piefident is to nominate and appoint is
evident.âTreaties are to be made by the President, by and with
t.ic advice and confcntof the SenateâDots the Senate make trea
ties ? But not to recapitulate arguments, it was upon another idea
(M. . Sedgwick observed that) he rose.
i. he institution of the office to be eltabliflied by this bill origi
nates in the idea of the incompetency of man. All the powers
neceiarily devolve upon the President which this officer is to b,
appointed to execut âhence the realon and propriety of the ab
solute dependence on, and responsibility of this oijicer to the Pre
iident. The executive department is extensive, and naturally d.-
videsitfelf into a variety of d fferent branchesâ.ll these branchc;
Â«'ie, or ought to be amenable to the chief magistrate, hence his
rc is greatly increased, provided the officers cf these
ieveral branches aie made dependent upon himâbut can this re
sponsibility b â¢ reasonably or justly expected of him, while the
persons executing the duties of these departments are independ
ent of him : The truth is, all these executive officers are as so
many auxiliaries-os the supreme executive, and therefore their
r-iponfibility is naturally resolved into that of the President as
cunflituent parts ol it : And without an entire depcndance upon
him the idea of responsibility in him is weakened and deilroyed.
In cases of incapacity and difqualification, which perhaps can be
known only by long acquantance and the frequent recurring of
evidence, what is to be done ? rrtuft the President before he
thall he relieved from the burden of such an officer,or the pub
lic ftrvicc placed in an eligible situation by difplaeing unsuitable
and introducing proper churaftcrsâl fay mult the Preiijentappeai
before a court of impeachment ? mud he be one party and the
aecufed another ? Let gentlemen consider whatmuft be then-full
of such a ,'r nation of things.
'1 he responsibility of the Senate is loft in contemplating the dif
ficulty of impeaching the members of a colleftive'body. It has
been said, that the judges are the only suitable persons to deter
mine this qiteftion ; but troin thc rcafoning ot others this point
is by no means clear : An appeal to the judiciary mull be conced
ed as foreign, and can not engage the serious attention of the
committee at the present moment.
Mr. I.ee replied to the various objeflions of Mr. White : He
then proceeded to state the merits of the qucftion, and observed,
1 .'iat it is a max : m in government, that the legislative, executive'
and judicial powers, should be kept fcparate anddiftintt as possible'
In the formation of the Constitution of the feveral'States, parti
cular attention has been paid to this essential point.
1 he Constitution under which this House is now fitting, is framed
upon the fame principle ; and it lays with this body to'kecp those
powers in that state of separation : It is of consequence that ihc
people ftiould form just ideas of these diftinft powers, and know
where they are severally dpofited, so that by this m -ans, the pub.
Jie jealousy may at all times reccivc a proper dire&ion : On this
the liberties of rhe people dependâthat die bi anch
es which ir.vcfts them with the powers peculiar to their original
oeiign, is theonly way to create that responsibility, without which
the government never can be watched and guarded. Tins lefpon
-lhinty muftofneccffity reft principally with the executive branch;
Jt is in vain.to look for it in the other branches :It is that branch
yhich is naturally refprted to as the centre of this responsibility â 
" is congenial to the ideas which we connett with the inrtitutiÂ»n'
"t the office of Chief Magistrate ; it is implied in the very expref
lion : Now if theminifters of those departments which are created
to carry into crt'eft the great executive objeas of government, are
independent of he President, or are rendered accountable to the
joint control oi the Senate and the President, it is evident that the
idea of responsibility is dissipated, and in a great measure loftâ
will tin be agreeable to the withes of the people? Uponthe whole
1 cannot fee the danger which gentlemen appear to apprehend from
tnat conftruftion of the Constitution which this clause is calculated
to give : On the-other hand it appear, to me perfectly consonant
to its (pint and design ; and it is the duty of the Houfs to uive a
denfive opinion on the cafe.
M.. Boudikot : I have, Sir, attended with the grcateft care to
the arguments which have been offered upon both fides of the sub.
vT rr C the committee, and from the wholeam convinced, that
thee.hcacy of th<*government depends on a just decision of this
question : I (hall always turo my attention to the Constitution
from v r 0n y dl ; tft Â° r y ; 1 " nnot a S rer with thc CC"'lcman
Iron, \ irginia, that this Congress cannot with propriety explain
and modi,y the principles of thc Constitution ; for il this'is a fact
â wi h.v.-no bufmefs here : Congress lias a right to exefcife all the
so*' hl| t are rleducible from the Constitution :We are not to
be ins.ii, need by ratifications, or by the fcceding States: I contend
that th.s power is inverted in the President, and that it is the duty
this House to declare it: The powers of thcrefpeaive branches
_ught to be defined and separated : One great objettion to the
Constitution is, that the powers ar not properly separated.
Mr.. Boud.not then repeated the arguments upon .appropriating
e relpefl'^power;, and observed, that officers Were appoint- d
and corrnmffioncd by the President, and not by the Senate : The
ot icer at the head of the department of Foreign Affairs is to obey
leo ders of the President, and confcquently must be dependent
upon him, or else hu obedience cannot be commanded : If we
C to declare that the power of removal is
n the President, thaii we not leave our great executive departments
in confufion, and low the fccdsqlj.-aloufyanddiffatisfjflion among
a fuhftirâ¢. r C "Â° f government ? Gentlemen have proposed as
fubfli.nte the power offufpenfion ; butthispowcr will be found
as e.xeep iiWable as the other, and liable to greatabufes. Thc Pre
retnf! .fill ca " t,ous , of unncceffHry removals ; the Senate may
refute to fill the vacancies ; what will be the consequence ? It is
painful to refit cf upon the fubjea in this point ofview : The pow
cr must then reft with the President ; it will be impossible for him
to perform thedutn s of his department without it.
fbU l rif ACKS i ON That the decision upon the clause in
this 1 ill involves the fate ot the other two, the War and Treafurv
n P ki' ! n !C k tS : ' lnd , u 1S evidrm) y the object of thc Bill to
eftablifhthc principle in the present instance, before thc department
of the Treafnry is brought forward. 1 tmLnt
I contend Sir, that the several branches of the Legislature are
plainly pointed out in the constitution ; and those of the P.efident
are particularly enumerated: The heads also of the several de
partmcnts ar. enumerated and designated as fcparate ; and the Pre"
lident is not confiderea as the head of the whole :Heis to receive
then atv ice and require their opinions in writingâthis is the ex

or appendages of the executive, this provision in the Constitution
will be nugatory. I l, C g leave to differ from gentlemen in re
gard to conftrua.ons-I consider then, as dangerous : The Con"
ftitution has pointed out these departmentsâCongress may arran
them; but this is different from confirm,,- ,he fvflem â¢ Tf "
prefumc to define and conftruc the Constitution, there is no limus

Mr. Jackson further oblerved, that the principle lie had repuatcd
y advanced, refpethng the great departments being pointed out
inthc eonftitution fpecifically, and not as neceiTanly connected
with the Pre/ident, had not been attended to ; he called upon gen
' ' cm jn to ihew the fallacy of this pi incip e: It was clearly in his
mind, that it went to ihew the unconllitutionalily of delegating
tins power to the President; and he hop.d the clause would not
oe adopted by the committee.
Mr. Scott : I have listened with great attention to the debates
upon this question, and putting the arguments of famegentlemen
together, they amount to just this ; the raifmg a great number of
nghl ul pictures, which at lirll fight appeal very terrific indeed ;
but when minutely examined, turn out to be the harmless proge

P f!i whet ' ier t,lere IS such danger in giving this power to the

Extra# of a letter from a very refpe&able Member of Congress,
to his friend in this State, dated June 13.
" Mofl per Jons here will not believe that your people will be long
held in error with refpefl to thsir bcjl interejls. They consider thefipee
dy accejjion oj your State as a natter of certainty. IVith that idea, the
duty on lime arid barley was Jlricken out of the impojl bill. It was thought
unnecejjary to take any measures to eJfcEt a purpose which of itflf was so
nearly accomplished. The separation of your State is not contemplated
as a possible event. It need not be [aid, how much it would ajfcEl the
union ut large. The means which the government pojjejjes to make the
separation undesirable to your people, are equally obvious Let your
merchants, farmers and manufacturers, consider well how much they have
prospered in a Jlate of union with their brethren, and what may be ex
pected to ensure the continuance of their prosperity, whenever Congress
/hall be compelled to resort to those means. Every government mujt en
force its own revenue laws, and provide for the public fafety and tran
quility, as circumflances may require. Ido not pr tend to fay what
would be the line of conduct, if \our State should finally renounce the
union; but let a thinking Rhode-Island man weigh in his own mind, what
prudence andjuflice will require tobe done.
" I have nut a doubt that. \cur State willfinally accede to the union.
Nature, compact, inte r efl, the ties of honor, and thojr ofblood, bind us
indijfolubly together. Of all political eurfes, the mofl jormidable is dis
union; Jur Ido not know another. which that would not draw after it.
lam flocked to argue upon juch a topic. Yet, if it is only probable that
some party men intend a separation, it would be very proper to warn
your people of the conferences.
44 Of all conditions, that of fear and diflrufl is the mofl pain ful. The
reason why men submit to bear the burthen of government, is to be aflual
ly and to feel secure. What security againjl external force cayu
your people hate? Thefea is open to the fie ts of foreign nations, and ar
imaginary line divides youfrom your neighbours. Either the States will
be friendly, or they will not. IJ laws and oaths, and the aid of all good
men, who will make common cauf of any violation of their r ights, will
not induce you to unite with the States as brethren, on how much worse
fecurit.y will you not trufl them as neighboursf Suppose them hojtile, en
croaching neighbours, what willprotetl your State? Not its own Jlretlgth.
Will they seek foreign p rot erf ion? The idea is delusive. No nation in
Europe would consent to afford it, and all Europe would not long be able.
Would all your property recompence them, if they should? Would a nati
on of /laves âwould armies and fleets refpefl your liberties, more than
your own servants?
" What is to become of xour proportion of the public debt? If that
fhQuid be adjufled without the voice of your representatives, and prompt
payment demanded, would the burthen Jail lightly upon your citizens?
The taxes on con sum ah l e articles wilt almojl imperceptably relieve the
States in the union J ram the effects of the war.
" Supposing the idea of ast partition to be disdained, as it will be by
every true American, then the people oj your State mufl consider the go
vernment as their own. If they are to live under it, and it is clear that
the\ mufl, prudence will dilate that they Jhouldvot lofc Vine in acceding
to it. The news-papers willfhew, that almojl very debate in Congref
has involved the mofl precious interejls oj Rhode-tfland. The interejls
of their eaflern breihreu are ivfeparably united with their own. The aid
of your State in Congress has been needed, and earneflly defined. Suiely
there is no profit in delay. On the contrary, you endanger your own
caufe â\oumay dej eat your own wfhes.
il The reafon s why your State should join the government. The
only reason why it should not, is drawn from the supposed tendency cj
some parts of the conflitution. That very reason will be found a very
flrong one why thexpiould accede to it. arid that with all possible expediti
on. The bufinejs of amendments is noio before Congress. If your
people are 1 n earn eft, let them fend their representatives to unite wth those
who are endeavouring to introduce them. They would be very arrogant
and uncandidto fuppof, that a majority in Congress are not as zealoujh
disposed to guard the freedom of America from violation as the people oj
Rhoae-Ifland. But if thev are the only people who love liberty, and who
know how to secure it, the federal conflitution, if it is as defcÃive as
they pretend, will furnifk J'cope for t heir talents. Congress is the body
in which fucli people may do good. If they are anxious to improve the
government, why absent th emfelvesfi om New-York? If amendments are
â iot made, who will be less excujable than they? If they objeff, perhaps
the amendments will not be agreed to. The answer is plain, they mufl
Vive under the government as it is. Surely the chance oj their adoption is
less, if Rhode-Iflandfhould be unreprefe"ted. North-Carolina has even
rejefled the conflitution yet they have called another convention, and will
1. cede beyond queflion. Why has that State been blind to the very diffe
rent policy of yours? The example of North-Carolina should be allowed
Jome weight The confidence that some amendments will be wade, has
guided them in twice calling a convention. 1 trufl that the difcufjion oj
the amendments will be liberally managed, and such as are proper wil>
be injerted. A motion for the purpose has been made, and it was urged
that it was proper to delay the confidt ration for some time, in order that
the States which have been mofl difjatisjied might be represented. Rhode-
Island was particularly alluded to, and it was said to be impracticable
for the members of your State to be chosen and sent in a fhorttime. The
wÂ»(ion contains a lill of rights, and many explanation s which cannot
fail toJatisfy any reasonable man. Accordingly the business was allow
ed toJab fide. You may be ajjured, however, that it will be r fumed as
soon as the government is organized, the revenue bill in operation, and
the great departments arranged. At prejent, the House is too closely
occupied with those objefls to attend to any other. It will not be evaded
r delated a moment, and it is myfincere belief that the amendments will
prevail.
" Thus, Sir, the people of your State have the alternative plainly be
fore them. An honorable opportunity presents to join the union. Ei
her they will acccde, or they will not. If they accede, the sooner they
do it the better. I defy any man to point out', even upon antifederal
b> inciples, an advantage that will ensue by delay. There is proof, equal
to demonfl rati on, of many dif advantages and dangers that will attend
t. On the other hand, if they renounce the union, they prefer danger
to fafety, poverty to opulence. It is thus that fear makes men blind:
0 avoid one danger, they of ten rush upon another; and to escape pain,
" jufi}e.r death."
An exafl account has lately been taken of our navigation, by which it

our merchants to fit one of the above vejfels (with a fuitahle cargo) either
for Europe, the East or Wefl-Indies,or even on a whaling voyage, with

ODE to CHARITY.
Compofedby brother Low, of Holland Lodge, sung on the above
occasion.
REs ITATIVE.
From regions of immortal bliss above,
Impart thy genial emanations. Love!
Soul of our Order ! Patroii oi this day!
Inspire our hearts, and prompt the solemn lay*

Come, Beauty of th' eternal Sire.'
Whose Justice we adore,
Whose power and wisdom we admiteâ
Thy smile attra&s us more !
Faith may command thevifual ray*
Futurity to scan ;
And Hope, by Fancy led aflray,
May picture Heav'n to Man j
But thou, blest CHARITY! can'ft give
Companion's thrill divine ;
From thee we heav'nly joys derive j
For Joy and Heav'n are thine!
CHORUS.
And when Faith and Hope shall fade,
When Heaven's portals are difplay'd*
When, with transports vafl and new 3
Things ineffable we view ; (
Then (Religion's source and aim)
CHARITY shall fan the flame;
Love divine shall be our theme,
Loveâeternal and fupremc!
This, this alone our constant Heav'n shall proveâ
The GOD of Heav'n in everlasting Love!
The world is waiting with anfcious expectation to fee the opera
tion of themw government : Much is julUy expetfced from the
legislature of the United States : The people of America having
set an original example by adopting in peace, without force,
fraud, or surprize, a Constitution, simple, plain, and competent to
their exigencies, a doubt cannot remain, but that all the acts and
doings of the legislature* will be such a comment upon its princi
ples, as will give it that compleat force and operation, which will
crown the wishes of this great people.
The cause of humanity gains ground rapidly among mankindâ
H w absurd the idea that it should eve> want a tnend anion; the
human race ! The abolition of African slavery is a confirma

be etfe&ed all at onceâhowever, every man who feels the lead
spark of fcnfibility glowing in his breast, will never ler the fub
jeft reft, till a system shall be f rined upon a scale however fatal!
that shall finally wipe off this foul blot from the annals of civili

From various part of the eaflward we learn, that there has been
the heavu ft rains known in the memory of man.

WEALTH EXAMINED.
[Continued from No. XX.J
Nedhain had forgotten the example of Caflius,
â which would have been equally apposite to prove
a limple aristocracy a bad government, and equal
ly improper to prove that the people in their fa
preme aflemblies, fucceflively cliofen, are the
best keepers of their liberty. It is also equally
proper to prove the contrary, and to shew that
such a simple democracy is as dangerous as a Am
ple aristocracy. These examples all ihow that
the natural principles of tilt English constitution
were constantly at work among the Roman peo
ple : That nature herfelf was constantly calling
out for two masters to controul thefenate, one in
a king or single person pofleffed of the executive
power, and the other in an equal representation
of the people pofTefled ol a negative on all the
laws, and especially on the disposal of the pub
lic money. As these examples are great illuftra
tionsof our argument, and illultrious proofs of
the superior excellence of the American conllitn
tions, we will examine the story of Caflius be
fore we come to that of the decemvirs.
The firft notice that is taken of Cafiius is in the
year 252, when he was consul, gained consider
able advantages over the Sabines, and received the
honor of a triumph. In 256 he was chosen by
Lartius the firft dictator, General of the liorfe,
and commanded a division of the army with suc
cess against the Latines. In the year 261, when
disputes ran so high between patricians and
plebeians, that 110 candidate appeared for the
consulship, and several refufed, the veflel was
in such a storm that nobody would accept the helm.
The people who remained in the city at last
nominated Pofthumius Cominius, A. R. 261, and
Spurius Caffius, who were believed equally agree
able to plebeians and patricians. The firft thing
they did was to propose the affair of the debts to
the Senate: a violent opposition ensued, headed
by Appius, who constantly insisted that all the
favor shewn the populace only made then? the
more insolent, and that nothing but inflexible
severity could reduce them to their duty. The
young Senators all blindly adopted this opinion:
nothing palled, in several tumultuous aflemblies,
but altercations and mutual reproaches. The
ancient Senators were all inclined to peace.
a > w bo had obf'erveda fagaciousmedium,
neither flattering the pride of the great, nor fa
voring the licence of the people, beinc; one of
the new f'enators whom Brutus had chosen after
the expulsion of Tarquin, supported the opinion
that the good of the State required the re-esta
blishment of concord among the citizens. Sent
by the Senate 011 a committee to treat with the
people retired to the sacred mountain, he spoke
his celebrated fable of the Belly and the Mem
bers. The people at this conference, which was
in 261, insisted, that as, by the creation of dic
tators with unlimited authority, the law, which
admitted, appeals to the people from the decrees
of any r.iagift, ute whatever, was eluded, and in
a manner made void, tribunes lhould be created,
a new species of magistrates, whose sole duty
should be the conservation of their rights. The
affair of Coriolanus happened in this interval be
tween the firft consul ate of Sp. Caflius in 261, and
the second in 268; in which, probably, he had
adted in favor of the people in establishing the
tribunate, and in defending them against Corio
lanus, Appius Claudius, and the other oligarchic
Senators. This year, 268, he marched against
the Volfci and Hernici, who made peace, and
the consul obtained the honor of a triumph.
Caflius, after his triumph, reprefenred to the
Senate, that " the people merited some reward
" for the services they had rendered the coin
" monwealth, for defending the public liberty,
" and subjecting new countries to the Roman
" power: that the lands acquired by their arms
" belonged to the public, though some patrici
" ans had appropriated them to tliemfelves : that
*' an rquitable distribution of these lands would
" enable the poor plebeians to bring up children
" for the benefit of the commonwealth ; and that
" such a division alone could establish that equa
" lity which ought to subsist between the citizens
" of the fame State. ' He aflbciated in this pri
vilege the Latines fettled at Rome, who had ob
tained the freedom of the city.âTurn primum
lex Agraria promulgata eft. Liv. 1. ii. 41. This
law, which had at least a great appearance of
equity, would have relieved the misery of the
people, and no doubt rendered Caflius popular.
(To be continued.)
SKETCH OF THE POLITICAL STATE OF AMERICA.
[Continued from No. XX.]
AS the circmnftance of having two of tin* Ame
rican States still continue in their refufal to join
in union with the others, is a matter of specula
tion, and engages much of the public mind, it may
not be amiss, at this time, to make a few general
observations on this fubjec r t; in -which it will ap
pear, that ltrong natural and political reasons
uppofe their present di (union, and both must for-
cibly operate to cfFec r t their future junction : We
proceed to examine some of the causes resulting
lrom both these principlesâand it may from the
former be fairly argued, that nature has evident
ly deligned these States, at lealt for many years
to come, to be one united nation, and with her
unerring hand, pointed out innumerable blessings
to be derived to the inhabitants of this Western
World from such an union : Kor their encourage
ment to perfeverein completing this noble fabric
as a Temple to the Goddess of Libertyâa relief
from the fcourage of tyranny âthe ill directed
zeal of superstition and bigotryâand an aiylum
to the opprelled of all mankind : The reciprocal
wants of men arising from local lituation and other
circumltances, are here provided for by the kind
author of nature, in giving to America a partici
pation of the various climates of the world :â
Here a brother's arm, nerved by the bracing ze
phyrs of the Well:, ihall be extended to the aid
of a brother enfeebled by the lcorching beams of
a vertical funâHere the riches, which a fertile
foil and favorable climate give to the funs of the
South, /hall be wafted by their hardy brethren of
the North, to every part of the globeâThe blood,
become almost stagnant by the chilling froft of
northern latitudes, lhall be forced from the lieait
by the generous juice of the southern grapeâThe
indultrious worm, wrapt in his little orb, lhall
(unfolded by the genial ray of a tropical fun)
expand his lilken wings over the fair daughters
of Columbiaâwhile the fleecy tribe lhall willing
ly yield their snow white velfment to cloath the
arm by which they are cherished and protected.
Having viewed some of the natural, we proceed
to notice some of the political ties, which ought
to cement this Continent in one firm, efficient un
ion : Ihe fir ft of which arises from the proprie
ty of observing that maxim, foeflential to the sup
port of any government, and more especially a
republican, that the minority Ihould ever quietly
fuomit to be governed by the majority : However,
in objection to this, some fine-l'pun arguments
have been fophiftically urged to prove, that each
individual State poflelles within itfelf all the so
vereignty of a diftindt nation ; but such ideal,
chimerical aHertiona, cannot make an imprellion
on the mind deeper than the furfaceof the paper
which contains them. What do we mean by lb
vereignty, but tlicdepofitof supreme power : Can
there be thirteen depolits of supreme power exifl
ing at the fame time, directed to finiilar ends,
and for the fame purposes : Shall the language
of the several States, to the general government
itill be what McFingal has heretofore welldefcri
bed it,
" You shall be Viceroys it it true;
" But we'll be Viceroys over you."
Noârather let our united language in future,
run thus :
We'll be a nation, it is true,
Anci tor that end, the means purfuc.
It is certain, without pra&ifiug on this princi
ple, we can never claim that character. Of what
avail will be the polleflion of sovereignty in each
State, without the ability to l'upport it! 'i he mad
man fees in the watry mirror a crown dazzling
with diamonds, and plunging to grasp the fancied
object, perishes in the attempt. Who doubts of
the natural independency of every son of Adam ;
but who will contend that both his power and
liberty are most compleat under the operation of
a good government.
These States, in that united act by which they
abjured theÃritilh government, not only pledged
themselves to each other for every poilible riiijue
in their contest to be rid of usurpation and tyran
ny ; but also their joint exertions to raise a future
government, calculated to secure their freedom
and hap pin essâand no one of them has now a right
to recede from the original contract, or oppose
tliofe measures which a majority of their fellow
citizens have deemed as necellary to effect this
valuable purpose ; nor is their conduct in diflent
ing from the union to be juftified on any princi
ple of governmentâhaving a tendency to bring
on their country greater evils than those it has
been contending to avoidâthe horrors of a civil
war. The States alluded to are indebted to the
others for their joint efforts in emancipating thein
from a foreign yoke : They have a part of the
expence incurred by the war to difchargeâfor
which jullice cannot withold her claims : Many
more reasons could be urged to shew the impro
priety and ill tendency of their present defections
âbut it is yet to be hoped, that the paflions of
men, their little views, and mistaken interests,
will not be fuffered to fruftrate the benevolent de
sign of Heaven, marked by every circumstance of
our natural situation, and so often exemplified in
ourprogrefs towards the rank and character of a
nation. AMERICANUS
MR. FENNO,
I HAV E with much attention considered the ob
fervations handed to the public,through the chan
nel of your paper, by Americanus ; and am un
der theneceflitv ot fubfcribingto his opinion, in
favor of afecretary tor domestic afFairs ; not from
any regular train of rcafoning which he has used
or deduvftions which he has drawn in support of
this department, but from the dutin he has affion
ed to his fiec'i'-y two very eflential ones, he
has however omitted.âThese are the difcevcry -f
the perpetual motion, and the longitude. The fir/'
of these, is in my humble opinion of the titâ¢,.'-
importance to the United States, particularly in
the article of manufactures, so neceflary to our
existence. 1 apprehend little reasoning will lie
fuilicient to eilablifh this point. It is yenerallv
agreed that motion, is neceliary in aln'foft, evej'v
branch of manufactures, andperhaps some inge
nious philosopher, may yet find it requisite in
every branch. At present this motion is general
ly produced by men ; but this source mult flmrr
ly fail from the infatuation, and niadnefs, which
has taken hold of our labourers for emigrating
into the western country : now when tins ihali
happen, I humbly conceive Sir, that the ferpl
tual motion will be absolutely neceliary to fupniv
this defect. '
Americanus's lalt paragraph is a very extraor
dinary piece of composition : I have 'studied it
with the utinoft care, and with the express dp
%n of fubferibing to his opinions relative to the
western territory, as well as to the duties of bin
dome/lie secretary ; but Sir, his opinions are f..
involved by â words, without any direct conclusion,
that it was with difficulty 1 could find what he
was driving at. In the beginning he tells us
that hehas his " doubts of the principle,which in
a degree leads to the necessity of such an establish
mem," as a land-ofricc for the western territory
Why this, or any other -writer, ihould have his
" doubts" on the fubjed, is truly astonishing-
The " principle," or rather principles, which
lead us directly to " such an eftablillinient," as
the pointers do to the north pole, are firft, the
country: ficondly,the military bounties: thirdly, the
lales already made by the United States of part
of the territory : fourthly, the l ight that people
have to fettle their own lands, andjifthly, the right
that aperfon has to go from one place to another,
whether on foot, on hotfe-back, or in a waggon.
Americanus, views " any encouragement to
emigrate in the present state of our population,
as building up the interior part of this country,
at the expence of the atlantic fettlcmcnts." If
by difpoling of that country, " the atlantic set
tlements" pay their public debt, the cafe will be
diretftly reversed ; " the atlantic settlements"
will get clear of their debt, at the cxpence of
the western territory.âWhat he means by "pro
ducing an undue proportion of certain intereits,"
would require a commentator with all the abili
ties of Julius Sejliger, to unravel.âThis writer
grants, that if" the spirit of emigration cannot
be well flopped, or greatly checked, that it will
be doubtless most politic to methodise the fettle
inent of the western country." The emigration
cannot possibly be checked while the inhabitants
of " the atlantic States," find it their interellto
remove. The manufaifturers will reside where
they can be the most advantageously employedâ
the fame may be said of any other class of citi
zens in the United States; and 110 a ct, without it
is fufficiently energeticxo alter the nature of tilings,
can poflible take away such a right in this coun
try ; and any attempt, to produce such an effeift,
can only have a tendency, to shew the imbecility
of government when dire&ed to improper objects.
The great popular objedion to fettling the
western country, is the loss of our mechanics. â
I his objedlion is founded in mere speculation,
and can only have weight from experience ; and
however plausible at present, will lose its force
if the western country should be more favorable
tomanufacftures, than " the atlantic settlements."
When it becomes the interest of the people to
manufacture, they will attend to it whether east,
or weft of the Allegany Mountains; and when
it is not, no laws nor regulations, can compel them
to it. A. E.

Nothing will conduce more to flrengthen, confirm, and perpetuate
Union of States, than a more perfect acquaintance with
the temper, geniiis, manners, laws, customs, ana habits of each
other.
AMONG tht happy cjfcfis of the late war, may be reckoned the ab
dication Jrom the minis of our citizens, oj many deep rooted prejudices,
which prevented that mutualrefpett for the iharatlers of the several States,
so honorary and benificial to the general interejl of the whole. That in
tercourse which necejfarily arose from the cir cum fiance of marching the
eajlern and northern troops through the middle States, to fight the battles
of their country in the south, andfo viceverfa, was produflive cflajling
and f i/utary consequences: 7 hcujands by this means u-ere made acquaint
ed with the geography ef the country âits imtnenfe extentâits produce
its improvementsâits worth,and [hewed them what they faitght for: The
planters were taught to admin the hardihood, the independence and bra
very oj their northern brethren ; and while they contemplated then fern
republican virtues, they unfilled the fame spirit of enterprfe, end acknow
ledged the wisdom of th'ofe injiitutions, which exijled in the eajlern States,
and which contributed so ejfentially to produce an enlightened race oj he
roes in the yeomanry if the country. On the other hand the force oj thofi
republican principles, which inspired the majority of the citizens oj the
fontherti States, was no less an objefl of pleafmg contemplation : Theft
principles were paramount in their operation to all local habits and cufloms:
They burfl the barriers of an education friendly to domestic fervitudc,
ana produced a glorious emulation in the cause of universal liberty. The
war lilcwife produced a great variety of political, commercial,jripidh,
and conjugal connexionsâthe benign influences of which are continually
expanding, and are among the happiefl concomitants of peaceâandther'
is no doubt, have contributed greatly to the produflion of that uniform',
ojfentiment which has led to the present happy prospeCts of this greet re
public. If the casual and tronfert acquaintance oj our citizens in a lirtc
of war, has contributed to these events âwhat rjiay not be expeflcdfront a
