THE TABLE T.âNo. XLIX.
" The Coxcomb's course is vior.drous clever
THERE is not any person, among all my ac
quaintance, whole movements 1 have more
narrowly watched, than tliofe of a young cox
comb, who fonietimes vilits me. If the reader
wiihes to know why I have so critically inl'pe&ed
the actions of this finical youth, I will explain
my motives as concisely as I can. I have often
heird that every description of men have some
ufeful and commendable qualifications ; and in
order to ascertain the truth of this observation,
I pitched upon a coxcomb as the most suitable
fubjecft to bring the question ro a test. If any
valuable qualities can be dil'covered in such a cha
racter, 1 think we may pronounce with some cer
tainty, that no mortal is exempt from a lhareof
good properties. We ftioulddiftinguilh between
qualities that are ufeful to one's felf, and those
that are so to other people. My prcfent enquiry
lhall be princpially confined to the former.
In the firft place then a coxcomb can not be a
lazy man. lam fcifible many censorious people
are often ranking him with the idle and dilTolute.
The charge has no foundation in truth. Whoe
ver attempts to follow all the fluctuations of the
falhions, and fuffers no other person to keep a
head of him in this refpecft, will find full em
ployment for his avflivity and discernment. It is
impoflible any one can do this and be indolent.
The young fribbler, of whom I am now l'peaking,
is engaged in no profefled line of business, and
yet I know of no person, whose time is more in
ceflantly occupied. He mentioned to me, the
other morning, by way of apology for not per
forming ari engagement he was under, that he
had not had a leisure moment, for more than a
fortnight past. This aircumftance induced me
tÂ« keep a vigilant eye over his anions, and fatisfy
myfelf in what manner, he consumed his days.
I called at his lodgings two or three mornings
successively, so early that I found him at home.
He employed nearly three hours in drefling, and
I am convinced he could not do it in a ftiorter time.
More than an hour was devoted to the barber,
and the reader may be certain it was not a mo
ment too long. The fop had almost as much to
do as the barber, for he rose from the chair, ten
times in the course of the operation, to fee if all
the hairs were well adjusted. But the hardest
ta/k was with the boot-maker. My friend had a
dozen pair of boots to try, and it took him more
than fifteen minutes to draw one boot over his leg.
In the course of the experiment, I am confident
he went through more fatigue, than a laboring
man would have eudured, by breaking flax smart
ly for ax hours. It would be endleis for me to
particularize all the objecfts, which unavoidably
fall in the way, and prevent a coxcomb from
wearing away his moments infloth and inactivity,
ft mult be remembered that he has the process
of drefling to pals through,twice in twenty-four
''I 3? 1 ! 8 ' The remainder of his time is spent in
visiting and in some fafhionable amufeinents,
which can by no means be performed by a lazy
man. These remarks will, I hope, exculpate my
drcfly acquaintance from the charge of indolence.
But a more beneficial efietft, than that just
mentioned, is derived from being a complete cox-
in the fecuriry it affords a man again ft
thepainsand inconveniences of being captivated
v '' Â£ h female charms. It is well known that one
of these butter-fly men loves no created being so
well as himfelf. His whole powers of admiration
nnd employment about his own person. Any
disgust or inattention, Ihewn him by a female, is
called caprice ; and is iuppofed to result from a
of elegance or purity of taste. Thisfhel

tiling can be more disagreeable to a man of real
foppery. He avoids every situation where he can
not be looked at and flattered. His inclination
leads him among genteel people, who admit him
as an aflociate for the civility of his deportment,
and who are themselves too well bred to call in
queftionhis claims to admiration.
Lipon the whole, I am induced to believe that
moll people entertain too mean an opinion of
coxcombs. It is a much more Unexceptionable
character than is usually imagined ; and a well
ihaped stripling, who has rich friends, and slender
talents, maybe said to have taken his belt destiny:
when dress is the objec r tofhi9 care, and personal
vanity the motive of his condudt. By this means,
he will at least escape being a lounger, as he
must of courfebe aiftive and busy to keep up the
part he aflumes.âNor will he probably become
a drunkard, a knave or a blackguard ; for he
can be neither of these, without eflentially inter

To the PRESIDENT of the UNITED STATES.
SIR,
THE representatives of a free people can
not comply with their duty to their constituents
more to their fatisfa<stion, than by paying a just
tribute to the merits of one, wliofe important
exertions, unexampled perseverance, and distin
guished military talents, have eminently contri
buted to the establishment of their liberties. Im
prefled with the mod lively sense of your love
for your country, invariably evidenced in the
course of your part services, and of which you
have given a new proof, by facrificing your pre
dilection for private life to the desires of your
fellow citizens, and again appearing on the pub
lic ltage, we molt lincerely congratulate you on
your elevation to the high station you now fill.
I lie citizens of this State, having been among
the lirft to adopt the system of federal govern
ment on which they so much depend for their
portkm of the national prosperity, can not but
be highly gratified by the progress which has
been made towards its compleat organization ;
and they have a pleasing addition to their fatis
latftion, by your having been so unanimously pla
ced at the head of it. We are confident that we
declare the lenfe of the people of Pennsylvania,
when we ailureyou of the firm and cdnftant sup
port of this State in all meal'ares, in which its
:iidfhall beneceflary, for rendering youradmini
ftration cafy to yourfelf, and beneficial to your
country.
We deem it a circumstance which strongly
marks the good sense and virtue of our country
men, that they peaceably and deliberately con
curred in a frame of general government, which,
we firmly trust, will, in its operation, dignify
our character, entitle us to rclpert among thenu
tions, and ensure happinefsand fafety to us and
our polterity. With hearts expanded beyond
the limits of our own country, we most ardent
ly hope that the influence of "this novel but bright
example, may be extended, till fi-eedom, under
governments of laws, not of men, shall bless the
opprefled of every climate and country. The
old will then be experimentally taught by the new
world, that reason, virtue, union, moderation
and patriotism, can, under the smiles of heaven,
without the sword, accomplish the happiness of
nations by pacific revolutions in their political fy
llems, wlienloever they require them.
With the warm eft wishes for* your personal
happiness, we fervently beseech the great Author
and Supporter of our exiftente, that he will, by
granting you a continuance of health, long pre
serve a life so dear to your country, and exem
plary to mankind.
The Answer of the President of the United States
to the foregoing Address was received and read
September 16, as followsâ
To the Representatives of the Freemen of the Com
nlMwitlth of Pennsylvania in General Assembly met.
GENTLEMEN,
WHEN the representatives of a free people,
delivering the sense of their constituents, give
such marks of affectionate attachment to an indi
vidual as are contained inyour addrefe to me, it
must caill forth the vr arm eft acknowledgement
of a grateful heart. Under this impreHion, I
beg you to believe that your favorable opinion of
my past conduct, and kind congratulations on my
elevation to the high station which I now fill, are
indelibly marked on my mind.
The early and decided part which the citizens
of Pennsylvania took in behalf of the present

system of government, can not be forgotten by
the people of these United States ;âand, in ac
knowledging the grateful sense which I have of
your afliirances of the firm and constant support
of your State, in all measures in which its aid
(hall be neceflary, for tendering my adminiitra
tion easy to myfelf and beneficial to our country,
I trust that I meet the concurrenfce of all good
citizens.
The virtue, moderation and patriotism which
have marked the Iteps of the American people,
in framing, adopting, and thus far, carrying in
to efled: our present system of government, has
excited the admiration of nations, and it now on
ly remains for us to acft up to thole principles
which fliould charadlerife a free and enlightened
people, that we may gain refpeft abroad, and en
sure liappinefs to ourselves and to our posterity.
It lhould be the liigheft ambition of every Ame
rican to extend his views beyond himfelfâand to
bear in mind that his conduct will not only affeift
himfelf, his country, and his immediate posterity ;
but that its influence and efFeift, maybe co-exten
sive with t;he world, and stamp political happi*
ness or misery 011 ages yet unborn.âTo obtain
this desirable endâand to establish the govern
ment of laws, the union of these States is abfoÂ«
lutely neceflary; therefore, in every proceeding,
this great âthis important obje<ft fliould ever be
kept in view ; so long as our measures tend to thiÂ»,
and are marked with the wisdom of a well-inform
ed, enlightened people, we may reasonably hope,
under the finiles of Heaven, to convince the
World, that the happiness of nations can be ac
complished by pacific revolutions in their politi
cal systems, without the intervention
of the sword.
Your wiflies for my personal happiness, and
fervent prayers for the preservation of my exist
ence, have made a grateful impreflion upon me ;
and I shall not fail to implore the Divine Author
of the Universe to beftowthofe bleflings upon you
and your constituents that tali make a people
happy. G. WASHINGTON.
' EUROPEAN ACCOUNTS, BY THE LAST ARRIVALS.
BERLIN, JULY 27.
Our Sovereign Itill continues unremittingly to
use his good offices for the pufpofe of bringing
about an accommodation beteen Russia and Swe
den, after having succeeded with his Allies, the
King of Great-Britain and the States General of
the United Provinces, in bringing Denmark to
observe a ftrid; neutrality. A Treaty with the
King and Republic of Poland is still on the tapis,
but not concluded. The opposition which the
Poles make to the views of the two Imperial Cotrrrs
may cause some change in their sentiments, and
in the endjpreferve a more equal balance in the
affairs of Europe.
VIENNA, JULY 13.
His Majesty the Emperor has not had any re
turn of the fever some days. Yesterday was the
day which was to determine whether the fever
was to appear again, or entirely to leave his Ma
jesty. Happily it did not return, which spread
universal joy throughout the empire. The Em
peror is uncommonly chearful, and takes a vast;
deal ofexercife in the open air. We now hope
our Sovereign will inalhorttimebe perfecftly re-
Itored to health.
LONDON, JULY 31.
It is probable that the Royal Exiles of France
will attempt to raise commotions ; but cut off as
they are, from communicating with their depend
ents, they cannot estimate the strength of their
friends ; and should they,at this juncture, open
ly attempt to raise forces, or by any means to
oppose the people, the life of the Sovereign Would
be in immediate danger.
It is a fa(fl that a gentleman of Hackney, of
reputation and fortune, has just returned from
Paris, who during his stay was in the midst of the
troubles ; and from good authority we inform
our readers, he was one of those who firft enter
ed the Baftile, and with a party secured the Go
vernor with others, after which they proceeded,
and entered a dungeon ofimmenfe depth, strong
ly secured with iron bolts and bars, where they
released an Englifli officer, said to be a Major
White, who had been confined a prisoner 26
years in that dismal cell. The key of the door
the above Gentleman has brought home ; it was
fnewn round the coffee-room at the Antigallican
Coffee-houfe, Threadneedle-ftreet, Wednefday 1
afternoon, among a number of French gentlemen,
who with great plaudits, exclaimed, Liberty ! Li
berty ! Liberty !
When the prisoners were liberated from the
Baftile, Major White presented a figure the mostsnlfcralile. Ihe Duke of Dorfct attempting to
hold a conversation with him. His Grace conde
icended to inform himof his lituation ; hut when
he told White that he had bren in the Baftile, he
contradicted him, bat with expressions that car
xied full conviction of dett'royed intellects. From
exterior difeale his presence' was very noifoine.

A profound secrecy has hitherto been observed
ref'pevfting the mysterious trail faiftions of this en
gine of defpotifin. The late revolution, howe
ver, has unveiled many important and fino- u lai
en omittances till now involved inobfeurity.

was attended with great ftare,and allowed every

that of Speech, is at 1 ast difcovcred, and an ac

BASTILE ANECDOTE.
Among other atfts of oppreflion that have come
to light since the destruction of the Baftile, the
following one may not possibly be reckoned the
mterclling. In the year 1785, a person of
lank and fafhion in Paris, became enamored of a
beautiful young girl, Matilda, the daughter of a
respectable tradesman, who refufina;to encourage
his passion, (the father) was soon after thrown
into the Baftile. The lover of the girl, tile foil of
a wealthy citizen, and who was to have been mar
ried to her in a few days, dreading the like fate,
made his escape to Constantinople, where he en
tered into the military service, and acled as a vo
lunteer under the Grand Signior, leaving his in
tended bride under the care of a female Servant.
Oil the present troubles breaking out, the youno
man returned to Paris ; and, equally stimulated
by love and liberty, was the firft to enter the
breach made ,n the Baftile, and proves to be the
very grenadier who was so honorably and so just
ly aiftinguiflied by his countrymen*. What ren
ders the account still more important, and marks
ftil more strongly the justice of Heaven, the un

PROCEEDINGS OF CONGR ESS
111 the MOUSE of REPRESENTATIVES
SATURDAY, SEPTEMBtR 26.
A MESSAGE was received from the Senat,
witharefohjtion to rescind the former resolution
refpecfting the time of adjournment, and to fa
on the 29th instant. Inthis refolutionthe Houfr
concurred.
Mr. Burke moved to rake up the resolution
relpecung the mifreprcfentations imputed to the
pubhfhers of the debates and proceed'inos of the
House, which had been ottered by him and laid
011 the table.
1 he fubttancc of this resolution was, that as
the Printers had grossly misrepresented the de
bates and proceedings of the House ofÃepiefen
tatives, their admiflion into the House ihould 110
longer receive the sanction and countenance of
the House.
The resolution being read, a warm debate en
sued between Mr. Burke, Mr. Bland, Mr. Cirr,
for, and Mr. Smith, (S. C.) Mr. Stone, Mr. Boudl
not, Mr. White, Mr. Page, Mr. Tucker against the
motion.
In the course of the observations, it was fur
mii'ed that the printers had been under out dmr
influence, that, for the purposes of party, thej
had misrepresented, altered, curtailed, mutilated,
and fupprefled speeches, greatly tending to in
fringe the freedom of debate ; "to injure the re
putation of the legiftature, and, 011 the fuppoli
tion of being fancftioned by the House, to hold up
the members in a ridiculous point of light, &c.
It was faid,no persons arefuffered to takeminutes
ill the British House of Commons; andthoit
was not contended that this should not be done
here, yet ifallowed, it ought to be under foine re
gulations.
_ In favor of the printers it was said, that ava
riety of causes might be afligned for the errors
they commit. âThe rapidity of pronunciation pe
culiar to some gentlemenâthe interruptions by
noise, and the lownefs of voices naturally gave
rife to miltakesâerrors were committed in
tranferibing, &c.âThat it mutt be forthe inter
est of Printers to give as full and as acctiratean
account as they could.âThat glaring and wilful
deviations from the truth, would ruin their repu
tation, anddeftroy their business, See Some of
the southern gentlemen, who had been home
during the fellion, declared that persons of vari
ous descriptions, had exprefled themselves great
ly gratified with the debates, as publilhed in the
liewfpapersâthataltlio they supposed them inac
curate in many particulars, yet the refultof the
business determined they were eflentially right -
and ihey thought that the reputation of the
House had been promoted by those publications,
and tlie dignity and importance of the govern
mentadvanced in the view of thepeople,
Mr. Burke at latt withdrew his motion.
Mr. Tucker then moved the following Reso
lution, viz.
Resolved as the opinion of this house, that
the admission of persons well qualified and dispos
ed to take the Debates thereof , with accuracy anil
impartiality, would tend to convey ufeful infor
mation to the citizens of the United States, and
that every person admitted within the bar foi
that purpose, ought to con(ider it an indifpenfa*
hie duty to use his utmost ability to render hispub
lication correct.
This was objected to by Mr. Madison and Mr-
Benson, and after some debate withdrawn.
A meflage was received from the Senate ac
quainting the House, that the Senate had appoint
ed a committee of conference 011 the disagreeing
votes of theHoufes on the fubiecfi: of the Frocels
Bill.
The House appointed conferees to meet thofr
of the Senate 011 that fubjecft.
The House also received from the Senate the
bill for fixing the feat of government of the tin
ted States, to which the Senate had proposed an
amendment, by ttriking out all that part refpe 1
ing the Suf quehanna, and inferring a clause fixing
the permanent feat of government, at German
town in the State of Pennsylvania.
A motion was then made to pottpone the con
fideration of this amendment of the Senate ti

UNITED STATES, SEPTEMBER 29, 1789.
Gentlemen of the House of Representatives.
His Mojl Chrijlian Majejly, by a letter dated the 7th of June lejl,
adarejjed to the President and Members ojthe General Congress of the
United States of North America, announces the much lamented death oj
"' s fÂ° n the Dauphin. The generous condutt of the French Monarch and
nation towards this country, renders every event that may affefl his or
their pro J ferity inter efling tons ; and I shall take care to a/Jure him of
thefenfibility with which the United States participate in the affliclion
which a lojs so much to be regretted.mujlhave occaftoned both to him and
t0 thcm - G. WASHINGTON.
United States, Sept. 29, 1780.
Gintlemrn ofithr House of Representatives,
Having Ycjlerday been informed by a joint committee of both Houjfs
efCongrefs, that they had agreed to a rccefs to commence this day, and
to continue until the jirfl Monday in January next, I take the eirliejl
opportunity oj acquainting \ou, that con fide ring how long and laborious
this session has been, and the reajons which I prejume have produced this
rejo/ution, it does not appear to me expedient to rccommend anv mrafures
to their conjideration at'prefent. G. WASHING TON.
A message was received from the President of the United States,
by Mr. Secretary Lear, with four Ads of the Legitlature, which
have received the approbation and signature of the President.
Mr. Gekry introduced a rcfolution to the following purport,
That it shall be the duty of the Clerk of the House, and Secretary
of the Senate, to transmit an attested copy of the Journals of cach
House, to the Supreme Executive, and to each branch of the Lccrif
latureof the leveral States, refpe&ively. This was adopted, and
sent to the Senate for their concurrcnc<\
A meHage was rcccived from the Senate, informing, that they
concur in the above relolution.âAlfo, the bill to eftabliih troop ,
&c. for the dcfence of the frontiers, was sent down by their Se
cretaryâthe Senate infilling on their seventh amendment to fa:d
bill. Also the rcfolution on the memorial of John White,
concurred in, with amendments, which amendments were ac
ceded to by the House. The Senate also sent down an ast which
they had puffed in favor of the liaron de Glaubeck.
The House then took up the above seventh Amendment, and on
motion to adhere to the original fettions, the question being put
was negatived.
The question for concurring with the Senate was then carried
in the affirmative, by a large majoiity.
The House then pafled the bill inform, for allowing the pay
of a Captain for a certain time,to Baron de Glaubeck : which be
ing enrolled, was signed by the Speaker. The bufincfs afligned
for the present feflion being finilhed, the Speaker, pursuant to
Resolution, adjourned the House to the firft Monday in January
next, then to meet at the city of New-York.
["The above, closes our account of the proceedings of the firft
Session of Congrt f% under the New Constitution. Wehave aimed
to be impartial and accurate âand as particular as our limits would
admit. II the avidity with which the (ketches have been received
and read, is not indicative of their intrinsic merit, it conveys these
>deas very forcibly, that the Constitution is an objett of prime con
fluence, and that the tranfa&ions of the General Government arc
considered as highly intcrefting to the good people of this confe
derated Republic. The original publication of these fkctches in
the newlpapers of this city, has proved a fountain of information,
to every part of the Union : The streams conveyed through the
medium of the innumerable channels of Intelligence, with which
these rising States are so highly favored, have served to give the
government a more realized exigence, by bringing it home to the
door of tvery citizen. This method of laying open to the full
vuew of the people the proceedings of their political Fathers, is
productive of the happiest eflfefts : It prevents innumerable impo
sitions arising from mifreprefentat'.on and falfehood ; it unfolds
principles, and exhibits characters in a just point of light; the
people learn to know whom to trust, and to give honor to whom
honor is due. May the Freedom of the Press always be justly
prizecK and facrcdly preserved by the free citizens of the United
States.]

Extract of a letterfro?n Paris, July ij.
u The Grenadier who foaled the outer barrier
of the Baftile yesterday, has had a laurel crown
decreed him : An old officer who was witness of
his bravery and danger, tore frofri his own bosom
the order of St. Lewis, and gave it to the grena
dier in that moment, and laid, take this, thou art
more deserving of IT than i. Decorated
with this, and thd Grofi of the Governor of the
garrison, and the cordon blue, he has paflea the
Itreets and the square of Palais Royal twiceâonce
lupported by two grenadiers of his own corps (the
Guards Francois,) and the next time mounted.â
He is an old soldier, and bears 3pplaufe like anian
of good sense and great fortitude."
By some late accounts it appears probable, that the'ravs of free
dom will penetrate those darkrecefTes of ignorance and bigotry,
the Monaftcries and Nunneries of France : Should this be the cafe,
iminenfe treafurcs, that have for ages been (hut out from the light
of the Sun t will emerge into day.âMany a golden dove, that never
moved, will rind the use of its wings : Many a mafi V image, that
has been confined for centuries, will find its legs and walk offâ
and being melted by the fire of Liberty, which reduces all bodies
to a proper level, will diffufe univei sal joy among the pockets of
the people.
How many fair, but wretched vi&imS to a blind teat; will re
joice in those glorious beams, which foall pervade the gloomy re
gions, where they thought themfclvcs immured for life ! Their
ncarts will bound with rapture at the music of Freedomâand re
stored to Liberty, and the rights of humanity, life will afTuttie r
new afpeft, when it invites them to enjoy all that they were intend
ed for by the beneficent author of exigence.
Extrafl of a letter from Bojlon, dated Sept. 25, 1783.
" Yesterday the Society oi the Cincinnati in this town gave a mofl
fplcndid entertainment at Concert-Hall to the Officers of His Most
Christian Majesty's squadron. The tables formed a serai-circle.
At the head of the Hall was placed a lull length portrait of The
President, with the real eagle pendant from the painted button hole.
On his right a displayed American Ensign . On his left a Freneh
ditto. Over his head was a Star, encircling three F.'eurs de Lis,
with the motto eflo perpetuj, At the other end of the Hall, the eye
was caught with a fine pisure of His Most Christian Majesty, with
the French Ensign on h s right, and the American on his left :
Over his head were thearmsof France, the motto Vive l.ouis XVI.
The Orchestra was coveied with blue broad cloth, edged with
white ; the thirteen Stars, and Thirteen Fleurs de Lis formed on
the ground a very beautiful Constellation : The bald soared
from the centre : opposite the Eagle, on the other fide of the room,
was the arms of Maflachufetts, finely executed. The chandeliers
and several parts of the room were ornamented with flowers, ThÂ«?
whole forming as happy a coup d\cil as fancy can imagine. The
choicest viands, the most delicate paftery, and exhilerating winrs
crowned this feftive board : happiness fat on each countenance,
good humor and friendfhip reigned supreme: the toasts were ju
dicious. &c.
'â¢ The A&ive frigate failed yesterday for New-York : She is
gone to carry the refpetts of the Chef of the Division, to The Pre
sident of the United States, the Ambafiadorof France, See.
LONDON.
Sortie of Gibralter. sty Mr. Trumbull.
Of the merits of thispidurc there ii a general concurrence of
opinion. The fubjeft is chosen with great judgement : And
while the artist celebrates the glorious triumph of one nation, he
has happily availed himfclf of the gallantry of an individual to
palliate the defeat of the other. This is liberal ; and the trophy
due to courage receives new honors from its being conferred in
a rival country.
As a work of art, whether we consider the composition, the
drawing, the expreflion, the effeÂ£t of light and ftiadow, or the
coloring, we do not hesitate to pronounce, that we have feert
only two productions on this fcaleofthe English school which
we think equal to this : The death of Lord Chatham, and th<j
pierfon of Copley, rank highly in our esteem ; but the Wolfc>
tho in composition and design very beautiful, bears no propor
tionate claims to admiration with' ( the picture before us.
Monday morhirtg the Light Horse* and the other Independent
companies in this city, paraded in the Broad Way, under the im
mediate command of Col. BaukJa nâfrom whence they proceed
ed to the Race Ground, where they went thro a number of manoeu
vres in a manner that would do credit to regular troops ; after
which theyexhibited a sham fight, that afforded the highest enter
tainment to The President, His Excellency the Governor, and a
large concourse of refpeftable characters.
We cannot but with regret mention one unhappy circumstance
whichoccured, Adjutant John Loudon, a most amiable and wor
thy character, in the prime of life, received a wound (as we are in
formed with a buck ftiot, through the carelessness of one of thÂ«
men in loading his piece) of which he expired on the field.âBv
this forrowful accident, has his family been deprived of a dutiful
ion, an affectionate brother, and focietyof a worthy member.
Yesterday the funeral solemnities of Mr. John Loudon were
attended with every mark of public grief, which the truly affecting
circumstances of his death were calculated to inspire. The Pro
ceflion waspreceeded by two Companies of Light-Infantry, with
arms reversed, and the Holland Lodge of Free Masons, of which
he was a brother : On the pall were laid masonic and military In
signia : The diftrefled family ; the reverend Clergy, and a numer
ous train of mourning friends followed : The military Band play
ed a solemn Dirge, which according with the solemn sensations of
a vast croud ol citizens aflembled on the occasion, added, greatly
to the seriously imprefTive scene.
When a person dies in defence of a just cause, in the defence of
his country or the protection of the rights of mankind, we may
apply the expreflion ufedby the author of Cato,
How beautiful is death when earned by virtue ;
But when a person so truly and justly esteemed falls a facrifice in
a trifling way and on an unneceflary occasion, how ghastly ! how
shocking ! how terrible is death !
