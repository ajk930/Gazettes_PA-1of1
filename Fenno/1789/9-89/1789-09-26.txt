SUBJECT OF NO. 47 CONTINUED.
.< the union of the states should be the first
'â¢ article IN the political creed of every
Â« AMERICAN."
IN our last we endeavored to Ihew that no politi
cal evil was to be apprehended from the pre
tended diversity of fouthernand eafterninterefts.
_It will be found that there is as little to be ap
prehended from other supposed causes of divi
(ion. The universal freedom in religious mat
ters, which is not only allowed by the govern
ment, but incorporated into the conllitutions of
the States, has rendered the people of this coun
try less liable to discord on that account, than
any other nation. The diversity of manners and
euitonis is becoming less every day. The nation
al government will contribute to hasten this pro
gress, and to fix a standard for manners and lan
guage. The commercial intercourse of the States
is increasing. Nothing unites men more than a
concurrence in Common sentiments and objects of
pursuit. Every American holds liberty nearest
hii heart, and depends on the aid of every other
American to defend it. There is no country
where the people arefo well agreed in their firlt
maxims, or so deeply imprefled with a sense of
the importance of them.
If we consider the state of some of the moll or
derly governments in the world, we iliall find that
they are much less homogeneous than our own.
France is actually divided into several diftin<ft
provincesâand they are Hill more divided by dif
tiad laws and customs, and even by a different
language. We are better acquainted with the
Britiih kingdoms : If the diversity in question it
incompatible with a common government, then
the prosperous state of that country will prove that
there is no such diversity : Yet the fad; is that the
narrow territories of Britain and Ireland are in
habited by a people, in different ftagesof civiliza
tionâwho speak several different languagesâwho
glory in the victories obtained by their ancestors
when mutually lioftile, and whose remembrance
of former injuries is embittered by mutual scorn
and national hatred. Till lately their interests
have been facrificed to commercial monopolies,
and their rights as men abridged by a policy which
continued to be jealous after it had ceased to be
vindidive. Their customs, manners, and princi
ples of government, and religion, are, apparent
ly, the leafl: likely to aflimilate together. The
Scotch Highlanders, the people of the isles, the
Welch, the wild Irilh, and the Englifti, the op
prelled Catholics, the perfccuted Jacobites, the
Difienters and Episcopalians are surely more un
fit le become one people than the citizens of the
Southern and Northern States : Yet all these peo
ple are approximating,and it is a question whether
ia a course of time, not very remote, there will
remain any traces of discrimination. That event
is of the less importance, as, in fa<ft, with all the
supposed diversity of interests and opinions, that
kingdom is one of the inoft profperoU6 and belt
governed of any in the world. It is certain that
it has been believed in that country, and many
seemed to derive a malignant pleasure from the
belief, that the people of America, tho indepen
dent, were so unfortunately circumstanced that
they would not govern themselves. If we did not
know that the paflions and prejudices of men
make them blind to the most obvious truths, we
(hould wonder how Engliflimen could be duped
by an hypothesis which is so abundantly refuted
by their own experience. If the Americans can
not preserve their national government, it is not
because they are too unlike to afiimilate, or that
they want the acutenefs and vigor of mind to per
ceive and establish the principles of a wife go
vernment.
It i 6 because habit, which is nature to an en
lightened people, and is more, is neceflity to an
ignorant one, has not acquired its ordinary autho
rity over the mind. We have been accustomed
todiftincfc, independent governments : We have
not been used to think nationallyâto consider
ourselves as an indivisible whole : Other nations
reverence the antiquity of their institutionsâ-even
those which are oppreflive are borne without re
pining, and almost without pain, because they are
used to bear them : The neck, grown callous, is
â Jo longer galled with the yoke. Antiquity and
Itate craft have involved the powers and princi
ples of government in mystery. The veneration
of the public is heightened by obscurity, and tho
amagiftrate, who should usurp power, would pro
bably be ruined, yet opposition to lawful autho
rity would ltrike the people with horror.
In this country things are on a different foot
ing. w e have seen the beginning of our govern
ment. We have demolished one, and setup ano
ther, and we think without terror of the process.

being prote<S:ed, almolt every good man has aid
ed m propping a tottering authority. He has felt
the weight ofhis in dividual strength and counsels.
Government has leaned upon the people, and a
wile and virtuous people have adopted a Consti
tution worthy of themselves. Already it has pro
cured us the refpecSl of Europe. Let us learn to
reverence it as the glory and fafeguard of our
country. Every people has a partial fondnefs for
their own country. National pride and preju
dice are found to be as strong, and unchangeable
in favor of the most wretched terrirory, as of the
lnoft fertile and salubrious.
Tho nature has covered the earth with barren
ness, and the air with pestilence, and tho society
is ft ill more cursed with defjpotifin, the people
will resent reflections on their country, as the
ciueleft of all insults, and will consider an exile
from it as the most deplorable of all misfortunes.
How well thenlhoulda people love their country,
which they govern and nature favors ! Reafonand
time will concur in making the Americans rever
ence and love their government. Before this/hall
be effected, the danger to the national government
will not spring from the diversity of manners,
customs and interests. Almost every event of our
hiitory has contributed something to dispose the
public mind to enthusiasm. The ruin of most re
publics has been caused by fits of honest frenzy,
during which they destroy the pillars of their own
security. The more diverse and hollile the in
terests and opinions of the people are, the lefsare
they all liable at the fame moment to the agency
ot thiscaufe. For inthis cafe, the torrent of en
thusiasm would be confined within the channel
which it might firft take. The ray in palling thro
another medium would be refracted and finally
loft. Opposite and equal forces would destroy
each other. But our people reason and adl so
nearly alike, that they will be heated at the fame
moment. They are all conductors for the ele<!t
rical fluid, which pafles so unaccountably thro the
mind, and communicates so intense an heat in its
paflage.
It is not intended to deduce from hence that
the national government will not endure. It is
merely to expose the fallacy of the opinion, that
we are too unlike, and too much divided in point
of interests to maintain one national government.
This opinion has long been painful to the patri
otism of many sensible men.
It is equally to be hoped that the great extent
of the country, the good sense of the people which
is every day more and more enlightened by sci
ence, and the wife and prosperous administration
of the government will be found fufficient to give
it liability.
AUTHENTIC INFORMATION.
Every Citizen of the Worliâevery friend to the rights
oj mankindâand more efptcially every citizen of the
United States, mufl feel int ere fled in the important
Tranfacftions in the Kingdom of France :âThe
following authentic and judicious JOURNAL
OF EVENTS, as they transpired from day to day,
at the crifts of the glorious Revoluthn, will afford
our readers a more competent idea of matters, than
ha-s yet been pnblifhed.
Extract of a letter from Paris.
" THE capture of three French merchantfhips
by the Algerines under different pretexts, has
produced great sensation in the seaports of this
country. The scarcity of bread begins to leflen
in the southern parts of France, where the harvest
is commenced : Here it is Hill threatning, because
we have yet two or three weeks to the beginning
of harvest.
" The reunion of the orders took place on the
27th June. Within the Aflembly matters weni
on well ; but it was soon observed that troops,
and particularly the foreign troops, were ontheii
march towards Paris from various quarters, and
that this was against the opinion of Mr. Neckar.
The Marflial de Broglio was appointed to com
mand all the troops within the Isle of France.â
Some of the French guards were soon arrested
under other pretexts, but in reality on account
of their difpofitionsinfavorofthe national cause.
The people of Paris forced the prison, released
them, andfenta deputation to the States General
to folicita pardon. The States by a 1110 ft moder
ate and prudent arrete recommended these pri
soners to the King, and peace to the people of
Paris. Addrefles came in to them from several of
the great cities, expressing sincere allegiance to
the King; but a determined resolution to support
the States General.
" On the Bth of July they voted an address to
the King to remove the troops. This piece of

9th. They pioceed to fix the order in which
they will take up the several branches of their fu
ture Constitution, from which it appears they
mean to build it from the bottom, confining them
selves to nothing in their ancient form but a King.
A declaration oi rights which forms the firft chap
ter of their work, was then proposed by the Mar
quis de la Fayette âthis was on the nth.
" In the mean time troops to'the number of
about 25 or 30,000 had arrived, and were ported
inand between Paris and Versailles. The bridges
and pafleswere guarded. At 3 o'clock in the af
ternoon the Count de la Luzerne wasfenttono
tify Mr. Neckar of his difmiflionâat midnight
he set out tor Bruflells. This was not known till
the next day (12th) when the whole ministry
was changed, except Villepeuij. of thedomeftic
department,and Barentin Garde des Sceaux*
These changes were as follows : The Baron
de Bret e ui l, President of the Council of Finance,
and De la Galaitiere, Comptroller General in
the room of Mr. Neckarâthe Marshal de Broc
lio, Minister of War, and Foul on under him
in the rooinof Puy-se g urâM. deIaVAUGUYON,
Minister of Foreign Affairs,inftead of M.de Mokt
morinâDe la Porte Minister of Marine, in
place of the Count de la LuzerneâSt. Priest
was also removed from the Council.
" The news of this change began to be known
in Paris about lor 2 o'clock. In the afternoon a
body of about 100 German cavalry were advanced
and drawn up in the place Louis XV. and about
300 Swiss ported at a little distance in their rear.
This drew people to that spot, who naturally
formed themselves in front of the troops, at firft
merely to look at them ; but as their numbers en
creafed, their indignation arose : They retired a
few steps, ported themselves on and behind large
piles of loose stones colle<fied in that place for a
bridge adjacent to it, and attacked the horse with
stones. The horse charged, but the advantage
ous portti on of the people, and the showers of
stones obliged them to retire, and even to quit the
field altogether, leaving one of their number on
the ground. The Swiss in their rear were obfer*
vednever to stir. This was the signal for univerÂ«
sal infurretftion, and this body of cavalry to avoid
being maflacred, retired towards Versailles. The
people now armed themselves withfuch weapons
as they could find in armorer's lhops and private
houses, and with bludgeons, and were roaming
all night, through all parts of the city, without
any decided and practicable obje<ft. The nexc
day (13th) the States press on the King to fend
away the troopsâto permit the Bourgeoisie of"
Paris to arm for the prefervatiqn of order in the
city, and offered to fend a deputation from their
body to tranquilize them ; He refufes all their
proportions. A committee of magistrates and
eletfors of the city are appointed, by their bodies,
to take upon them its government. The mob now
openly joined by the French guards, force the
prisons <jf St. Lazare, release all the prisoners,
and take a great store of corn, which they carry
to the corn market : Here they get some arms,
and the b rench guards begin to form and train
them. The city committee determine to raise
48,000 bourgeois, or rather to restrain their num
bers to 48,000.
On the 14th they fend one of their members
(M. de Corney) to the Hotel des Invalides, to
ask arms for their Garde Bourgeoife : He was fol
lowed by, or he found there a great mob : The
Governor of the Invalids came out, and repre
sented the impoflibility of his delivering arms
without the orders of those from whom he receiv
ed them : De Corney advised the people then to
retire, retired hiinfelf, and the people took pof
feflion of the arms. It was remarkable that not
only the invalids themselves made no opporttion,
but that a body of 5000 foreign troops, encamp,
ed within 400 yards, never stirred. M. de Corney
and five others, were then sent to aik arms of m!
de Launai, Governor oftheÃaftile: They found
a great collection of people already before the
place, and they immediately planted a flag of
truce, which was answered by a like flag hoisted
on the parapet: The deputation prevailed on the
people to fall back a little, advanced themselves
to make their demands of the Governor, and in
that instant a discharge from the Baftile killed
four people of those nearest to the deputies -
The Deputies retired, the people rushed against
the place, and almost in an instant were in pofÂ»
feflion of a fortification, defended by 100 men, of
infinite strength, which in other times had flood
several regular sieges, and had never been taken.
How they got in has as yet been impoflible to
discover : Those who pretend to have been of theJiarty, tell so many diiFerent stories as to destroy
the credit of them all. They took all the arms,
clifcliarged the prifoners,-and fuchofthegarrifon
as were not killed in the firft moment of fury,
can ied the Governor and Lieut. Governor to the
Greve (the place ofpublic execution) cut off their
heads, and lent them through the city in triumph
to the Palais lloyal.
About the fame instant a treacherous corres
pondence having been discovered in M. de Fles-
Selles, Prevoil des Marchands, they seize him
in the hotel de ville, where he was in the exercise
of his office, and cut off his head. These events
carried imperfectly to Versailles were the fubjet't
of two l'ucceliive deputations from the States to
the King, (i jrh.) The King went about 11 o'clock,
accompanied only by his brothers to the States
General, and there read to them a fpeech,in which
he asked their interposition to re-eltablifh order
he i eturned to the Chateau a foot, accompanied
by the States : They sent offa deputation,the Mar
quis de la Fayette at their head, to quiet Paris :
He had the fame morning beennamed Command
ant en chef of the milice bourgeoife, and Mons.
BaillY , former President of the Stares General
was called sos as Prevoft des Merchands. The
demolition of tlii Baftile was now ordered and
began : A body of the Swiss guards of the regi
ment of Ventimille, and thecity horse guards
join the people : The alarm at Versailles encrea
ies instead of abating : The foreign troops were
ordered offinftantly : Every Minister resigned :
The King confirmed Bailly as Prevoft des Mar
chands, wrote to Mr. Neckar to recall himâ
ient his letter open to the States General to be
forwarded by them, and invited them to go with
him to Paris the next day to fatisfy the city ofhis
dispositions. (r6th.) The King came to Paris.
Omiting the less important figures of the pro
ceflion, I will only observe that the King's car
riage was in the centre, on each fide of it the
States General in two ranks afooN-at their head
the Marquis de la Fayette as Commander in
Chief, on horseback, and Bourgeois guards before
and behind. About 60,000 citizens of all Forms
and colors, armed with the muskets of the Baftile
and Invalids as far as they would goâthe reft
with pistols.swords, pikes, pruning hoSks, feythes
&c. lined all the streets through which the pro
ceflion pafled. The King landed at the Ho'el de
Villeâthere M. Bailly presented and put into
his hat the popular cockade, and addrelled him
and delivered his answer to the audience. On
their return the popular cries were " VIVE LE
RO\ , ET LA NAT lON : He was conduced by
a garde Bourgeoife to his palace at Versailles.â
Letters written with his own hand to the Marquis
de la Fayette, remove the scruples ofhis position.
Tranquility is now restored to the capital : The
shops are again opened : The people resuming
their labors, and if the want of bread does not
disturb our peace,we may hope a continuance of
it.
The demolition of the Baftile is going on, and
the milice Bourgeoife organizing and training
The ancient police of the city is abolished by the
authority of the people.âThey believe still that
people have fallen vidtims to the tumults of
Paris.âWe cannot find with certainty that any
body has been killed but the three before men
tioned, and those who fell in the aflault or defence
of the Baftile. How many of the garril'on were
killed no body pretends to have ever heard :
Of the aflailants, accounts vary from 6 to 600
the moll general belief is, that there fell about
thirty. Therehave been many reports of instan
taneous executions by the mob, 011 such of their
body as they caught in atfts of theft or robbery :
Some oftliefe may perhaps be true : There was
a severity of honesty obfervedof which 110 exam
ple has been known : Bags of money offered on
various occaftons, through fear or guilt have been
uniformly refufed by the mobs.âThe churches
are now occupied in singing " DeProfundis" and
" Requiems for the r-pofe of the fouls of the brave and
" valiant citizens ixihohave fealednbith their blood the
" liberty ef the nation." M. de Montmorin is
thisday replaced in the department of Fo
reign Affairs, M. de St. Priest is named to the
Home Department. (21ft.) M. Neckar had
left Bruflels for Franckfort before the Courier <rot
thereâWe expert, however, to hear of him in a
day or two. M. le Comte de IaLuzERNE has re
sumed the department of the Marine this day.
The spirit of tumult seemed to have sub
sided, when yesterday it was excited again by a
particular incident : M. Foullon, one of the
obnoxious ministry, who, as well as his brethren
had abfcor.ded, was taken ill the country, and as
isfaid bv his own tenants, and brought to Paris.
Great efforts were exerted by popular ib*i a(fters
to favehim : He was at length forced out of the
hands of the garde Bourgeoife, hung immediate
ly, his head cut off, and his body drawn through
ihe principal streets of the city. The Intendant
of Paris, M. de Chauvigny, accused of having
entered into the designs of the fame ministry, has
been taken at Compeigne, and a body of 200 men
011 horseback are goniTfor him.
I jull now learn that Bertie r de Chauvigny
was brought to town in the night, and mafiacred
immediately."
PARIS, JULY 30.
In flie storming of"the Baftile, the Governor,
the door-keeper, with two or three others, were
maflacred. Mr. Foullon, Intendant, has been
kept three days, with 110 other food but hay
betore hini, and afterwards was hanged by the
populace at one of the cords which suspend the
rcverbcres (lights) in the streets. The particu
larity of the hay put before Mr. Foullon, comes
from an answer he made a few days since : Being
told the people had 110 bread, he replied, " Lei
them cat hay." He is the fame who had pro
posed to emit 100 millions, tournois, in paper
money. Ihe Lieutenant de police, of Paris,
has been hanged ; as well as Madame de Polignac's
[the Queen s favorite] chambermaid. TheCcmte
d Auois, M. de Polignac, and hundreds more
have fled. All the country is in arms, the peo
ple having broken open all the arsenals in the
kingdom. \Ve are here under military duty,
wearing the cockade of Union, white, rose, and
blue. Unwilling to fuffer any troops in the town,
we have done more, we have fired from the settees
upon a small veflel bringingfome artificers : We
will not fuffer any soldiers.
The National Allenibly received a long letter
in English yelterday, from that mad bigot, Lord
George Gordon.
M. Neckar arrived at Versailles on Tuesday evening last, and
this morning he came to the Hotel de Ville, where he was re
ceived will, every mark of joy and fatisfaflion. He wasefrortcd

PROGRESS Of MANUFACTURES.
In noticing theprogrefs of manufactures in the
United States, it ought not to be omitted, that Mr.
Wetherle, of this town, has lately erected at
Dedham, Works for the Manufacture of Wire,
&c. which promise to be advantageous. We also
mention, that from native ore, which Mr. Robert
Pope, of this town, manufactured into Wire,
that ingenious artist has made a number of the
true kerby Codho'.ks, which have been pronounced
by gentlemen of Marblehead and Cape-Ann to be
greatly superior to any imported : Numbers of
them were used the late season, and Mr. Pope has
orders to manufacture a quantity fufficient for the
next.
A few years since there was not a Paper-Mill in
Connecticutânow there is annually manufattur
ed there, above 5000 reams, besides pasteboard,
&c. In this State, mills are continually erecting.
Fivethoufand yards of Cloth have been manu
factured in Hartford manufactory, from Sept. 1,
178s, to Sept. 1, 178^ âsome of which has fold for
five dollars pr. yard.
Very handfoine Waistcoat Patterns, of fine lea
ther, have lately been manufactured here, and
promise, from their neatness, strength, and the
durability of the colors, to be much worn.
WESTERN POSTS.
We have it from good authority, that THE
PRESIDENT of the United States has lately dif
patclied Capt. Guion, formerly of the American
Artillery, to Canada, to inquire of Lord Dor
chester, whether he has orders to surrender to
the United States, the Pofls within the territory
thereof, now garrisoned by Britijb forces ; and if
he has not, that he write to Europe, that he be
immediately furnifhed therewith. This intelli
gence, if authentic, of which we have not a doubt,
mult give great fatisfaiTtion to the people of the
United States, who have too long lamented that
the weaknefsof their government fubjecfted them
not only to a national indignity, but to a very great
loss in their fur and other trades. In the potent
arm of the Executive they now reft their hopes.

NEW-YORK, SEPTEMBER 26.
It is expe&ed that Congress will adjourn this
day, to meet the beginning of January. âMay
America never fee a less enlightened, patriotic,
and independent Legislature :âlt is but jurt to
observe, tuat punÂ«fluality and constancy have
marked their attendance at the hours of business
â that patience, perseverance, and dignity, have
distinguished their labors in the public serviceâ
and candor, liberality, and free disquisition pre
sided in their debates. The public mind appears
to be tranquilized, and waiting with calmnefsthe
operation of the laws, that have been enaÂ»fiedâ
And if an attention to the rights and privileges
of the people, united to a concern for the energy
and honor of the peopti's ovin Conjlitution, can en
sure the confidence of the States, there is the
faireft profpeift of the Government's being rooted
in the affections of the citizens of America.
Thecitizens of New-York wish the honor
able Legislature all possible happiness,
and that on their return to their Constituents,
they may be kindly accepted by the multitude of their
brethren, which, next to conscious approbation, is
the higlieft reward of patriotism.
THE CONTRAST.
FROM hoftilc fields, -where mercy prostrate lies,
We {bout returning victors to the flues ;
But patriot Sages, (kill'd in arts of peace,
Whose godlike labors, happiness encreafe,
Too often find, that where they merit fame,
The blasts of envy echo to their name.
What a train of pleasing ideas rulhes upon the
mind of every American, in contemplating the ef
fects of the late glorious Revolution. With ref
pe<st to our own countrymen,there is no doubt that
a conscious dignity pervades the bosom of every
freeman, to which in our dependent State they
were strangers : When we call our eyes West
ward, Northward, and Southward, we behold a
boundless theatre, on which a numerous race of
happy and enlightened citizens, are to exult in all
the bleflings of Liberty and good Government-
Virtue, Science, and Peace unite their beneficent
influences to render the prefmt andfuture condi
tion of human nature, more eligible than it has
ever been in any former period :âEurope from
America has caught the sacred flame of Freedom :
It has kindled in to a blazeâit has illuminated
their darkness, and where tyranny eretfted hen
throne, and bigotry, ignorance, and fuperflation
supported her in fernal reign, the fun of a glorious
day has arifeiiâand Liberty rejoices in the divine
light and resplendent beamsi
"The foundations of tyranny are laid in igno
rance ; and the superstructure is supported by
the fame meansâknowlege and freedom go hand
in hand.âThe Hate of darkness in which the
eastern world has long been plunged, has pre
vented many of those kingdoms from lucceeding
in their efforts to obtain the just rights of human
nature. In modern times, if the resistance of
the people to the tyrants that oppress them,
should prove unfuccefsful, it vill generally be
found owing to traitors among tliemfelves ; and
the danger from this quarter arises from the too
general want of all principle, and the predomi
nant love of money among all ranks of people.
Factio v, properly speaking, is the offspring
of disappointment, pride, inordinate ambition,
and the whole train of the malevolent paflions :
Its objeel is in the firlt place the promotion of its
own individual advantage, without any regard
to thatof the community at large : To attain this
obje<S, there are no considerations, however sa
cred, which will not be facrificedâcharacters will
be defamedâmeafures reprobatedâjealousies ex
cited, and the public confidence in their rulers
will be aflailed, and destroyed if pollibleâtill its
views are aecomplifhed : When self is not the
prime motive to faction, a vindictive spirit of re
venge often designates its baneful manoeuvresâ
disappointed in its aspiring ambitious schemes, it
precipitates its votaries into all the excefles of a
wild, blind, and implacable enmity to its fuccefs
ful rivals,and nothing lhort of involving the body
politic in that anarchy and confufion which may
afford a favorable opportunity to carry its designs
into execution, will check the progress of its ac
cursed machinations.
Ex trad of a letter from a gentleman in Ireland.
" During the months of May and June last,
nine or ten American veflels have failed from
Belfaft, Newry and Derry, chiefly bound to the
Delaware and New-York, and took with them
upwards of two thoufande-z\ igrants from the north
of Ireland, almost the whole of them firfl: advanc
ing their paflage money, and not going out as
redemptioners, as was heretofore the cafeâma
ny hundred ufeful artizans and tradesmen went
in tliefe veflels ; and such was the ardor of the
people of the north of Ireland to get to America,
that there was a great overflow for eachfhip, and
some were even disappointed in getting paflages
for want of more American veflels to take them,
for it is a well known fact they will not go out in
any Irilh veflel, or with an Irish captain, when
an American offers, from a supposed better treat
ment from the latter."
THEATRICAL.
The highly raised expectations of the public
drew a crouded audience to the Theatre on Thurs
day evening; nor were those expectations dis
appointed, The entertainment was various,novel,
animated, and entertaining : The performers ex
erted tliemfelves with uncommon spirit, and were
rewarded with unequivocal marks of applause and
approbation.
