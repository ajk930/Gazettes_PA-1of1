HUMANITY.
Emancipated Africans have been compl' :ined of as defeating the be

TO the enquiry upon the fubjccl of the Afri"
cans, principally with to the behaviour
ot these who have b :e : emancipated :â
It may be observed, That all circuinftances con
sidered, their condudt is as irreproachable, ascould
reasonably be cxnectedâand nctwithftanding what
Iras been afierted, but fewinftances have occurred,
ot flagrantly bad chapters : It is however grant

It is a general opinion among those who keep

mind, is found incapable of imbibing ideas, or re

their lhape. I fay they are turned out to get their
living, in an inhospitable world, entirely destitute
of that knowledge, which is absolutely neceftary to
enable them to stand a common chance for a live

arrived to that advanced period of life, when ex
perience teftifies it is too late to learn.
, ' s incapacity is not a circumstance peculia,r to
c Africans : A, gentleman of my acquaintance,
w to was, at a former period, engaged in the bufi
of a publick In&ru<ftor, has allured me, that

it was found equally difficult to inttrudt either.â
Tliefe unhappy persons therefore ought not to be
irraigned upon the principles that apply lo those
who have enjoyed the blelling of an early educa
ionâfor how can fruit be expedled, where 110 pre
paration was made for the harvest ?
The least attention to the condu<it of white per
sons, who labour under the disadvantages of ignor
ance, will Ihew, th;;t vice, indolence, and wretch
edness, are not confined to the colour of the
Ikin.â
It may bealked, Whether there is reason to sup
pose, that, enjoying equal advantages, in point oi
education, with the whites, they would make equal
improvements ?âUnfortunately, experience does,
not at present furnifti us with documents to decidi
he question upon 3. general scale ; but nevertheless
here are a great many instances to prove, thai
hacks, who have had their education begun at a
proper period, have proved goodrnechanicks,Jarmers,
raders, and t cjpettable members of society. A variety
of particulars in point might be, enumerated, espe
cially in the country towns.
This information applies both to those who were
imported young, and to those born in the country â
with this, difference however, against the kidnap
ped Africans, that they are, in general, past the
age when impressions are made to the greatest ad
vantage, when firft sent into slavery. C.

LEJTTER VI.
Atnfterdavi, Gliober 10, 1730.
SIR,
THE sixth talk is to shew, " That no person, in
" America, is of so much influence, power,
" or credit, that his death, or corruption, by En
" glifli money, could be of any nameable confe
" quence."
This question is very natural for a stranger to
ilk ; but it would not occur to a native American,
who had palled all his life in his own country ; and
upon hearing it proposed he could only finile.
It lhould be considered, that there are in Ame
rica no Kings, Princes or Nobles; no Popes, Cardi
nals, Patriarchs, Arclibiihops, Bishops or other
ecclesiastical dignitaries. They are these, and
[*uch like lofty subordinations, which place great
bodies of men in a state of dependence upon one,
which enable one or a few individuals, in Europe,
to carry away after them large numbers, wherever
hey may think fit to go.âThere are no heredita
ry offices, or titles, in families ; nor even any great
illates that descend in a right line to the eldest
sons. All estates ofinteftates are distributed among
ill the children ; so that there are 110 individuals,
aor families, who have, either from office, title,
n- fortune, an exienfive power or influence. We
ire all equal in America, in a political view, and
is much alike as Lycurgus's hay cocks. All public
iffices and employments are bellowed by the free
hoice of the people, and, at present, through the
whole continent, are in the hands of those gentle
men who have diftinguilhed themselves the most,
by their counsels, exertions, and fufferings, in the
contest with Great-Britain. If there ever was a
war, that could be called the people's war, it is this
of America against Great-Britain ; it having been
determined 011 by the people, and pursued by the
people, in every step of its progress.
But who is it in America, that has credit to car
ry over, to the fide of Great-Britain, any number
of men ?âGeneral Howe tells us, that he employ-
Ed Mr. Delancy, Mr. Cortlandt ikinner,Mr. Chal
mers, and Mr. Gallon ay, the molt influenzal men
hey could find; and he tells you theii" ridiculous
access.
Are they members of Congress, who, by being
corrupted, would carry votes in C ongrefs 111 favor
of the Englifli.âl can tell you of a truth, there
has not been one motion made inCongiefs, since
:he declaration of independency, on the 4th of
July, 1776, foi a reconciliation with Gr eat Britain;
and there is not one man, in America, of luf
cient authority, or credit, to make a motion in.
Congress, for a peace with Great-Biitain, upon
my terms fliort of independence, without ruining
ills character for ever. If a delegate si om any one ot
ire Thirteen States, were to make a mouon for
peace, upon any conditions short of independency,
hat delegate would be recalled with indignation
oy his constituents, as soon as tlrey should know
,c.âThe Englilh have artfully repiefented in i.u
ope, tliatC ongi el's have been governed by paiticu
lar gentlemen ; but you may uepend vpon it, it is
falfe. At one tinre, the Engliflr would have made
it believed that Mr. Randolph, the fiift Piefident
of Congress, was its foul. Mr. Randolph died, and
Congress proceeded as well asfcver âAt another time
Mr. Hancock was all and all. Mr. Hancock left the
Congress, and has scarcely been there for thiee
years ; yet Congreft has pi oceeded wiilr as much
vvifdom, honor and fortitude as ever.âAt another
time, the English reprel'ented that Mr. Dickinfon
was the ruler of America. Mr. Dickiijfon opposed
openly,and upon principle,the declaration ot inde
pendency ; but, instead of carrying his point, Iris
conlUtuents differed with him so materially, that
they recalled him fromCongrefs, and he was absent
fonre years ; yet Congress proceeded with no less
constancy ; and Mr. Dickinfon lately, finding all
America unalterably fixed in the fyltem of indepen
dency, has fallen in, like a good citizen, and now
supports it inCongrefs with as much zeal as others.
âAt another time, the Englilh have been known
to believe that Dr. Franklin was the eflential mem
ber of Congress ; but Dr. Fanklin was sent to France
in 1776, and has been there ever since ; yet Con
gress has been aS atftive and as capable as before.â
At another time Mr. Samuel Adams was reprefent
edasthe man who didevery tiring ; yet Mr. Salnuel
Adams has been absent for the greatest part of three
years, attending his duty as Secretary of State in
the Maflachufett's Bay ; yetit does not appear that
Mr. Adams's absence has weakened the deliberati
ons of Congress in theleafl.â-Nay, they have fbme
tinres been filly enough to represent your humble
servant, Mr. John Adams, as an eflential member
x)f Congress ; it is now, however, three years since
Congress did him the honour to fend him to Europe
as a Minister Plenipotentiary to the Court of Ver
sailles, and he has never been in Congress since :
Yet Congress have done better since became away,
than they ever did before.
In short, Sir, all these pretences are the most ri
diculous imaginable. The American cause Hands
upon the eflential, unalterable character of the
whole body of the people ; upon their prejudices,
paflrons, habits, and principles, which they derived
from their ancestors, their educa' ion ; drew in with
their mothers' milk, and have been confirmed by
the whole course of their lives : And the characters
whom they have made conspicuous, by placing
Jiern in their public employments,
Are but bubbles on the sea of matter borne ;
They rife, they break, and to that sea return;
The fame reasoning is applicable to all the GoverÂ«f
nors, Lieutenant Governors, Secretaries of State,
Judges, Senators, and Representatives of particular
,tates. They are all eligible, and elected every
year by the body of the people ; and would lose
heir characters and- influence the instant they
ihould depart, in their public conduct, frton the
political system that the people are determined to
support.
But are there any officers of the army, who' could
carry over large numbers of people ?âThe influ
ence of these officers is confined to the army : They
have very little among the citizens. But if we
consider the conftitutirar of that army, we shall fee,
that it is impossible that any officer could carry
with him any numbers, even of soldiers. These
officers are not appointed by a King, or a Prince,
nor by General Washington : They can hardly be
said to be appointed by Congref3. They have all
commilfions fromCongrefs, it is true ; but they are
named and recommended, and are generally ap
pointed, by the executive branch of government im
the particular state to which they belong, except
the general officers, who are appointed by Con
gress. The continental army consists of the quotas
of officers and troops furnifhedby thirteen States.
If an officer of the Maflachufett's Bay forces, forex
ample, should go over to the enemy, he might,
poflibly,carry withhiiir half a do - /, soldiers belong
ing to that State j yet I even doubt whether any
PRICE SIX PENCE.officer whatever, who fliould desert from that State,
could persuade so many as half a dozen soldiers to
go with him.
Is it necefliiry to put the supposition, tl general
Washington Yhould be corrupted ? Is it poilible * .mt
lo fair a fame asWafliington's ihould be exchanged
for gold, or for crowns ? A character so falfe," so
cruel, so blood tliirfty, so detestable as that of
Monk, might betray a trull ; but a character fojult,
so humane, so fair, and amiable as Walhington's,
never can beftained with so foul a reproach.
Yet I am lully of opinion, that even if Mr.
Walhington Ihould go over to the English, which
I know to be impalfible, he would find none, or
very lew, officers or soldiers to go with him. He
would become the contempt and execration of his
own army, as well as of all the relt of mankind.
No, Sir ! the American cause is in no danger
from the defection of any individual. Nothing
Ihort of an entire alteration in the sentiments of
the whole body of the people, can make any
material change in the councils or in the conduct
of the arms of the United States : And I am very
Hire that Great-Britain has not power or art fuf
ficient to change eflentially the temper, the feel
ings, and the opinions of between three and four
millions ofpeople, at three thousand miles diitance,
l'upported, as they are, by powerful allies.
It fucli a change could ever have been made,
it would have been seven years ago, when officers,
employments, and power, in America, were in the
hands of the K ing. But every ray of royal authority
lias been extinguished now between four and five
years, and all civil and military authority is in
hands determined to refill: Great-Britain to the lall.
1 have the honour to be, &c.

PROCEEDINGS of CONGRESS.
Jn the HOUSE of REPRESENTATIVES of the
UNITED STATES.
Saturday, APRIL 18, 1788.
MR. Lawrence introduced a petition from the Mechanicks.
and Manufacturers of the city of New-York, the at
lent ion of Congress to their intereftsâreferred to a committee of the
whole.
The committee of Ele&ions reported, that the Certificates of the
Members attendinghad been examined by them, and were fufficient
to entitle the genth men to their feats. The Hon. Mr. Smith's cafe
was however postponed.
In Committee of the whole
The state of the Union was resumed, by taking up the Refolvc
upon Revenue.
An Impolt was voted upon the following articles, viz.
On Anchors, 7J pr. cent, advalorem.
Wool Cards, 50 cents, pr. dozen.
Wrought Tin Ware, 73 pr. cent, advalorem.
: Coal, 3 cents, pr. bushel.
Every barrel Salmon, }
do. Mackarcl, S 75 cents.
do. Shad, }
Quintal Fish, 50 cents.
Teas imported direÂ£t from India or China, *.n American fliips.
BoheaTea, pr lb. 6 cen^s.
Souchong and Ilack do. io cenfs.
Superior Green, do. ao cents.
All other Green do. id cefTts.
Teas imported from any other country, or in foreign (hips from
! ndia or China.
Bohea Tea, prÂ» lb. 8 cents.
Souchong and black do. 15 cents. . â¢
Superior green do. 30 cents,
Ali other green do. 18 cents.
Some of the above articles, it was proposed by particular Mem
bers, Ihould be itruck out, for reasons which had been afligncd to
have other articles expunged. Wool-Cards were obje&ed toâbut
t ie Members from the taftward fatisfied the committee* that the
American Manufa&ure of that article was carried to great perfe&ion,
and there was no doubt but such a supply could be obtained, of every
species os-cards, made in a superior mamur* as was more than ade
quate to the consumption of the States.
One gentleman observed, that he supposed the preference given to
Teas imported in American vessels, was to encourage our (hipping.
So far as the nieafure conduccd to that object, he was fatisfied, and
he was ready to hear arguments in fa\our of the trade to Indiaâthe
advantages of which were doubted by some persons. The trade it
was observed, was flattering to the pride of Americaâbut it was
not for revenueâit was not tor nccejfanesânot to export fupcrfluities
â but to export the specie of our country, See.
Jo these remarks it was replied, That fmce the revolution, the
trade to India had commenced, that it h d been prosecuted to ad
vantage, and was an extensive mart for a great variety of our fuper
llu( us articlesâthat from our local situation, we were enabled to
proitcute the trade with many advantagesâthat it was evident, that
â¡ t.r tuccefs had excited the jealousy of European powers, who would
avail thi infelves of every circumflancetoruin our fpeculationsto that
q< arter of the worldâthat therefore it was the duty of the Nation
al Lcgiflature, to hold out every poflible encouragement, to coun
:era& the machinations of our rivals, and prevent the ruin of the
trade.
It was further observed, that cafli was not the only remittance to
[ndiaâthat linmenfe quantities of produce were Hipped, Ginieng,
Lumber, Provisions, Arc. See.
Some obje&ions were made to a tax on Coal, but this duty was
idvo: ated f rom the policy of the measure, as conducing to the pro
motion of Navigation, incrcafe of seamen, and exploring the earth
in fe.irch of add itional minesâfor it was highly probable, that the
country abounded with that article.
Adjourned.
Monday, April ,20.
Met agreeably to adjournment.
Committee on John Churchman's, and Dr. Raj** ay's petition
reported. r '
Mr. Sherman called for the order of the dayâthe House then
rcfolvcd itfclf into a committee of the whole, 011 the Hate of the
Union. Mr. Pacf. in the chair.
The Resolve upon the Revenue was refunred.
On motion, it was voted, that the Impost on all goods imoorted,
not fpecified in the foregoing enumeration, excepting the iollow
llg, viz.
Tin in pigs, and Tin Plates,
Lead,
Pewter.
Wool,
Raw Hides,
Urafs,

Beaver, and other Furs,

Ihould he 5 pr. cent, advalorem.
Article of Tonnage was the next in orderâprevious to entering
upon which, Â°
Mr. Fi T 7.31 HONS moved, that a draw back ihould be allowed up
on all Rum, d,ft,lied from Molasses in the States, and exported o
any foreign port. r
Mr. MADD,SON objeaed to draw bach, at opening a â¢de door
0 defrauding tberevenue-w.fced the gentleman to otter his reasons
tor trie measure.
Mr Htzsimons suggested, among other reasons, *hat it would
1 e t . he minds our brethren of the Eastern States, who were so
argcly concerned in the Distilling bnfinefs->-that rum distilled in the
country could not be exported, if loaded with a tax-that it would
affefl an important branch of business, in a way, that no
1 r C ' ThC SÂ«'tlcman further observed,
.hat a was more easy, in his opinion, to provide checks to prevent
â auds, I than to devise m. thodsto enture the colleflion of the duties
Mr. L a w a aÂ» c 1 spake in favour oi the draw back.

From Massachusetts, by which he said it appeared, that but a lmall

Ihould be allowed on merchandize that maybe exported within
a limited time, the .mpoft of wh,c!i had been paid, or bonded -
the gentleman alfigncd various reasons for the motion.
Mr. Hartley proposed that the vote against the drawback
on Bum, Ihould be reconsidered for the present
Mr. White was opposed to a Drawback, it appearing to him
conducive to no advantage, and operating aga.nft the Revenue bv'

Mr. White observed, that it was evident the trade to Indii
did not need encouragement-He had been informed that there
were near forty fail in that line only from Maffachufetts-an eW

Ext raft of a letter from P of] on, dated Aprils.
" THIS day, at 10 o'clock, His Excellency JOHN
ADAMS, "fq. Vice-President of the United States,
fat out from his feat in Braintree, to take the chair
at New-York, as President of theMoftKon. Senate.
Previous to his setting out, the Roxbury Troop of
Horse, under the command of Col. Joh.i Tviei,
waited at his house and escorted him into town,
On his arrival at the fortification gates, the bells
rung a peal, and, amidst thefhouts of the aflembled
citizens, he was escorted to His Excellency the
Governour s, where the principal Officers of the
State, ami gentlemen of the town being aflenibled,
he partook at an Colation, provided bythe
GovernourâKewasfaluted onhis arrival by a fe
deral discharge from a detachment c f Major John
son s Artilleryâand also by a discharge on Instat
ing leave of our Chief Magistrate. During the
time the Vice President was at His Excellency
the Govemour's, the Middlesex Horse, under the
command of Capt. Fuller, arrivedâwhich, join- â 
ing that oi Col. 1 yler s, formed a very elegantef
cortâboth Corps being in blue, faced with white,
and the horses mostly ofonecolour, and very hand
some. By these corps, and better by his fellowci
zens, lie was accompanied to Charleftown, where,
on his arrival at the iquare, he Was again saluted
by a federal discharge, from Major Calder's Ar
t.Lcry, and escorted, by thetwo companies ofhorfe
to Cambridgeâ where the Roxbury harfe took
their leave of His Excellencyâwho, escorted by
liic Middlesex corps, continued his journey. Mr.
Adams will be met at Marlborough by Col. New
ell's regiment of Horse, who will relieve Capt. "
ful le r and in like manner, will tills great and
good man be accompanied to New-YorkâNet with <
the servile attentions of slaves and fubjeftsâbut by
the voluntary honours of his fellow citizens."
On Monday last arrived in this city, amidst the
acclamations of all ranks ofcitizens, His Excellen
cy JOHN ADAMS, Esq. Vice-President of the
Unit t d States, â she Cavalcade which escorted
His Excellency into the city, was numerous, an l '
tiuly refpe&able. From the Connecticut line to
Kingfbridge, he was attended by the Light Horse
of \V eft-Cliefter county, under the command of
Major Pi nt a rd. At Kingfbridge he was met by
Gen. Mal co m, with the officers of his brigade, anil
the City Troop of Horse, commanded by Captain
Stakes. Alio by Officers of diftintftion âmany
of Congressâand a large number of Ci*tizens in carriages and on liorfeback. On palling
the Fort, a federal salute was fired. I Jis Excellen
cy alighted at the house of the Hon. John Jay,
Esq.
A Committee ofbothHoufes of Congress, fpecial
]y appointed for that purpose, attended to congra
tulate his Excellency on his arrival.
Yesterday a committee of the Senate, consisting
of Mr. Strong, and Mr. Izard, conducted the
Vice-President to the Senate-Chamber, and
Mr. LangDon, the Prefulent, pro tempore, lef.
the chair, and * addressing the Vice-President,
said, " '1 hat heliadit in charge from the Senate,
to introduce him to the Chair of the House, and to
congratulate him on his appointment to the office
of Vice-Pr esident of the United States ofAme
rica. liethen conducted the Vice-President to
the Chair, who addrefled the Senate to the follow
ing purport.
Gentlemen of the Senate,
INVITED to this refpe&able situation by the fuffrages of our fel
low-citizens, accordingtothe Conftitutton, I have thought it m)
duty, cheerfully and readily to accept it. Unaccustomed to refufc
anv publick service, however dangerous to rry reputation, or djf
proportioned to my talents, it would havebeen inconsistent, to hav<
adopted another maxim of conduct, at this time, when the prosper.
ity of the country, and the liberties of the people, require perhaps
as much as ever, the attention of thofc, who pofiefs any share of the
publick confidence.
I should be destitute of fer.fibility, if,'upon my arrival in this city
and presentation to this Legislature, and especially to this \Senate, I
could fee, without "emotion, so many of those chara&ers, of whose
virtuous exertions I have so often been a witnefs-jfrom whofecoun
tenances and examples I have ever derived encouragement and ani
mationâwhose cfifinterefted friendlhip has supported mc, in mam
intricate conjunctures of publick flairs, at liome and abroad
Those celebrated defenders of the liberties of this country, whorr
menaces could not intimidate, corruption seduce, nor flattery al
lure: Those intrepid aflertors of the rights of mankind, whof<
philosophy and policy, have enlightenad the world, in twenty
years, more than it was ever before enlightened in many centuries:
by ancient schools or modern universities.
I must have been inattentive to the course of events, if I -were
cither ignorant of the fame or insensible to the merit of those othei
charatters in the Senate, to whom it has been my misfortune tc
have been, hitherto, personally unknown,
It is with fatisfa&ion, that I congratulate thÂ£ people of Ameri
ca on the formation of a National Constitution, and the fair prof
pe& of a consistent administration of a government of laws. On
the acquisition of an House of Representatives, chosen by tTiem
felves; of a Senate thus composed by their own State Legislatures.
and on the prospeCt of an executive authority, in the hands of one
whose portrait I (hall not presume to draw.ârWere I bleflfed with
powers to do justice to his charatter, it would be impoflible to in
crcafe the confidence or affc&ion of his country, or make the
smallest addition to his glory. This can only be effe&ed by a dis
charge of the present exalted trust on the fame principles, witli
the fame abilities and virtues, which have uniformly appeared in
all his former conduct, public or private. May I nevertheless, be
indulged to enquire, if we look over the catalogue of the firft Ma.
giftrates of nations, whether they have beerw denominated Presidents
or Cdnfuls, Kings or Princes, "where shall we find one, whose
commanding talents and virtues, whose overruling good fortune
have so completely united all hearts and voices in his favour?
Who enjoyed the esteem and admiration of foreign nations
and fellow citizens with equal unanimity ? Qualities so. uncom
mon, are no common blefling to the country that potfTeffes them-
By those great qualities, and their benign efFe&s, has Providence
marked out the head of this nation, with an hand so distinCtly vifi
klc, as to havebeen seen by nil men, and mistaken by none.
It is not for me, to interrupt your deliberations by any general
observations on the state of the nation, or by recommending, orpro
ponng any particular measures. It would be fuperfluous. to gentle
men of your great experience, to urge the necefiity of order. It is
only necessary to make an apology Tor myfelf. Not wholly
out experience in publick afTemblies, I have been more accustomed
to take a (hare ;n their debates, than to preside in their delibera
tions. It shall be my constant endeavour to behave towards every
Member of this Mod honourable Bodyy with all that consideration,
delicacy, and decorum, which becomes the dignity of his Ration
and character: âBut, if from inexperience, or inadvertency, any
thing should ever escape me, inconsistent with propriety, I must en
treat you, by imputing it to its true cause, and not to any want of
ic lp,eÂ£t, to pardon and excuse it.
A tiufl of the greatest magnitude is committed to this
Tegidatare and the eyes of the world are upon you. Your
country expt&s, from the results of your deliberations, in concur
rence with the other branches of government, Consideration abroad,
an d Contentment at homeâProsperity, Order, Justice, Peace and
Liberty . And may Cod Almighty's Providcnce aflift you to anf
v-cr their just expectations.

From the firft appearance of the New Conflitu
tion, the sentiments of the citizens of New-York
were decidedly in favour of its adoptionâln con
firmation of this, an uninterrupted series of fac'ts
has occurred: The following Arrangement foi

STATES, is an additional evidence of their atten
tion to the real dignity of the cityâand the high
veneration in which the illuih ious character it re
fers to, is held.

The moll diftingu fhrd among the sages of antiquity, have lefl
â t upon record, as the diftateof reason and the result of experience
" that the only/olid bafts on which to tJlMfli the public happtrefs, is o
REVERENCE EOR I HE DUTY." May the People of the UNITED
STATES, imbibe this sentiment, with all the additional force
with which it comes attended from the SACRhD ORACLES.
It is devoutly to be wilhed that the United States in their reve
nue system, may avoid the introduÂ£lion of wnat, .n cant phraf, au
.ermcd " Ciijlom House Oaths" such swearing hein n ' often found the
moil conv nient paj/port for contraband goods. Our allies the
French and Speniaids fct us an example in this business worthy ol
mitation.
It is an o1Â»k& of the great eft importance, 'list
an uniftterrupted series ot'fedcral sentiments flioul.t
be dilleminated through the American nationâ
Our political connection with each other becomes
daily more intimate and interesting : t?iis will, in
rime allimulate our minds, our habits, our man
ners, our objects, till we 'become one great Peo
ple, cemented by national ideas, natlon.il Ipirit,
and national glory.
Never since the formation of government and
civil society, were the great body oi a people, so
jniverfally solicitous and engaged about these
important subjects, as the citizens of the United
lates, at the pi efent moment. Every ear is
open! every mind is full! surely as the great
>lr. Adams said orf the American warâ" If ever
'' there was a Government of the People, this is
" the government."
The great objects which have arretted the atten
ion of our country since the came up
on the carpet, seem to have called up the molt
latent and astonishing powers of the human mind,
which have difcoveied themselves in a great vari
ety of instancesâin Procejfionsâ Publicationsâln*
jentions of Machine Improvements and Me
chanical Excellences.
In a late Bolton paper is the following para-*
grapli ; viz. An elegant Barge is now building in
New-York, to waft the great WASHINGTON a
cross the Hudson, to be rowed by ten SKA-CAP
TAINS, and to a 6: as cockswain.
The above Barge i now compleated, and is a
most masterly* conftrucYion in its lineâit is
between forty and fifty feet long, and moulded
upon the firleft model.
The laudable euriofity of* the publick is daily
gratified by a free acceilion to the Galleries of the
Hon. House of Representatives, where it is not
doubted that the most profound attention and per-"
feift decorum will continue to be exhibited by the
fpeftators and auditors.
A correspondent would enquire, if it is an
Order or Rule of the Gillery, to be covered
when the Speaker of a certain Hotoi. Koufe is ia
the chair ?
One day last Week a Bevy of Ladies appeared in
the Gallery of the Hon. House of Representatives
â-a most laudable euriofity is a Sufficient reason
for the novelty of the circumftancc.
Arrived in this city lince our last, the Most Hon.
Mr. Henry, from Maryland, and the Most Hon.
Mr. Gunn, from Georgia, Senators of the United
itstcs.
~ The illustrious PRESIDENT of the' United
States will arrive in this city to-morrow.
The Eagle in the front of the Federal State
House is now displayed ; the general appearance
of this front is truly august.
The Federal Barge was launched yesterday.
It should have been noticed in our firll number,
that Samuel Allen Otis Esq. of Maflachufetts,
is appointed Secretary, to the Most Hon. Senate of
the United Stafes, and John Beckley, Esq. of

ExtraÃs from a Madr'rd paper, January v 2O.
" The King of Spain was proclaimed in this cap
ital on Saturday the I 7th inft. with all customary
ceremonies. The Conde de Altemira, as Alferez
Maior of Madrid, bore the Royal Standard, and
was accompanied in the procession by a great num
ber of grandees onhorfes very richly caparisoned,
and alio by theCorregidor, Alguazil, Heralds, and
others. The Proclamation was repeated in differ
ent parts ofthe city, andfilver and gold coins, pre
pared for the occasion, were thrown by the Her
alds among the people. Ihe firft Proclamation
was made in the great square, in front of the palace.
Their Catholick Majesties were present, seated in
a balcony, and attended by the Ambafladors, and
other foreign ministers, and by the principal offi
cers of State. The acclamations of the people
were great and expreflive of much loyalty and af
feftioii to their Sovereign. Ihe publick mourn
ing was suspended during three days, a very large
lift of promotions was published, various entertain-
ments and balls were given,and there was a general
illumination on each of the three evenings.
" A royal order has been published at Malaga,
permitting for the present, and only atthe custom
house of that port, the free transhipping and de
posit of such produce, goods and merchandize, as
may be entered there and destined for the Barbary
or other foreign ports ; as also of such as may ar

Northern or other ports, including silver in coin,
in bars, or wrought ; which as well as all other
goods, is to pay, 011 being re-shipped, one pr. cent,
on the value, according to the invoice ; and gold

NUMBER 111.
" Debate and Dijfention not only flow froi/i civil liber
ty, but contribute to preserve it."
TN my last No. I mentioned having pafled anevcir
-t ing with two foreigners. The remarks, made
by one of them, have been communicated. The
reply of the other equally deserves notice. It is
,to the following effect.
" I confefs that your observations appear to be
founded in fact. No inference, however, to the
discredit of this country, can be drawn from such
circumltances. There maybe assigned two reasons
why the cicizens of the United States are prone to
Jpeculative controversy. One of them proceeds
from the nature of their government, and adts as
a permanent cause. The other results from par
ticular incidents, which may be considered adven
titious; but which unites its influence in producing
the general effecft.
" In a delpotick government, where the subject
, has no voice in making the laws, or in eitabliihing
modes of religion, he has little occasion to be a dil
putant. His whole attention is employed, in per
forming the duties that are laid upon him. The
cafe is totally the revcrfe in a country of freedom.
Every man knows that he may be eligible to legi-
Every man feels' a pride and independence
of spirit, that he can clioofe his own religion. This
operates as 6n eflabliihcd' cause of speculative en
quiry and investigation. No reflraint can fafely be
put upon an indulgence, which is in itfelf so falu
tary. 1 here is leis danger from excels than from
reliricflion.
" Ihe peculiar situation of this country has af
forded great scope for the difcuflionsof theoretick
men. It has infufed a spirit of altercation into all
ranks of people. Time and experience will corretfl
those extremes of such a temper, which have been
excited by special cauÂ£s. It must have its own
course, and work its own remedy. The love and
the pratftife of difputo, fh ike out light upon the
various fubjefts, relative to government. It habi
tuates men to reflection. I acknowledge it has
been carried so far, as to militate with ufeful oper
ations, and prevented a&s of real utility being in
troduced. Many of the States have totally "new
modelled their governments. This could Tiot be
produced without great deliberation. The fervour
has hardly yet subsided.
" The entire tolerarion of religion has given a
large range to persons prone to controversy. Each
fetft naturally wiflies to extend its influence. The
forms of government and religion will be better
ascertained, and men will have determined what
fide to take, in both. When this happens, the
evil yqu complain of, will in part be removed.
But while the spirit of liberty exists, controversy
is unavoidable."
Thus spoke my two companions. The one point
ed out errors, and the other accounted for them.
Their observations, whether they are new or not,
appear to be just. Such hints ainufe fame people,
while they do injury to none.
A HINT7~
ONE finding feature in tliepolitical complexion
of the Dutch Republick is, that the children
of both sexes are, from the moment of the earliest
capability, initiated in some line of indullrious avo
cation among them. Solon and Lycurgus coidd
not have chalked out a wiser line for the service
of the Grecian States. It was an opinion with
Alexander the Great, that boys nurtured and bro't
up in the camp, were ever after fond ofarmsâand
practice gave fantftion to the theory. It holds e
qually good, that children, early trained up to in
dustry, ever incline to it in maturityâfor, in the
language of the poet, "it grows -with their growti,
and Jfrengthens, vi:th their flrength." To our coun
trymen, we hope the application is evident. If
they accustom their little ones to honest employ
ments (such as will suit their years, constitutions
and choices) they will thereby render them virtu
ous andindeqendent citizens,a credit to tliemfelves,
and an ornament to society. The consequences of
a different conduct are evident.
ANECDOTE OF LORD MANSFIELD.
THIS J udge being in one of the counties, on the
circuit, a poor woman was indicted for witch
craft. The inhabitants of the place were exafpera
ted against her. Some witnefles deposed, that th.2_>
had fecn her walk in the ai;-, with her feet upward
Lord Mansfield heard the evidence with great tran
quility, and perceiving the temper of the people,
whom it wouJ d not have been prudent to irritate,
he thus addrefled them. lC Ido not doubt that thh
woman lias walked in the air, with her feet up
wards, since you have all seen it; but she has the
hono ir to be born in England, as well as you and I,
and confeqaently, cannot be judged but by the laws
of the country, nor puniflied but in proportion as
ha< violated them. Now I know not cne law
that forbids walking in the air with the feet up
wards. We have all aright to do it with impuni
tv. I fc! noreafon, therefore, fqr prosecution ; ant
ilus poor woman may return home when she plcaf'es.

tried System of Government, will require the EN

Hence the propriety of encreafnig the Mediums of Know

AMERICA, from this period, begins a new Era
in her national existenceâ" the world is all
be yore her"âThe wisdom and follyâthe mjfery
and prosperity of the EMPIRES, STATES, and
vINGDOMS, which have had their day upon the
â  eat Theatre of Time, and are now no more,
fa rgeft the most important MementosâThese, with
he rapid series of Events, in which our own Coun
try has been so deeply interested, have taught the
Citizens of the United States, that
r'REEDOM and GOVER>#kIENTâLIBERTY and
LAWS, are inseparable.
This Conviction has led to the adoption of the
lew Conftitutiori ; for however various the Sen

good men are agreed in th 9 neceflity that exists,
ofan EFFICIENT FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.
A paper, therefore, eftabliihed upon NATION
AL, INDEPENDENT, and IMPARTIAL PRINCI
PLESâwhich shall take up the premised Articles,
upon a competent plan, it is presumed, will be
highly interesting, and meet with publick appro

The editor of this Publication is determined to
leave no avenue of Information unexplored : He
solicits the afliftance of Persons ofleifure and abili

ADDRESS.
THE Publick approbation alone can give ftabiU
ty and fucceis to any undertaking which tnulj
ultimately depend upon public opinion: This
idea has generally induced the Editors of new
publications to attempt anticipating that appr o .
Lat ion through the medium ol' projejficns, AvJiich
to lay the lealt, are, too seldom realized: Tit
editor of the. Gazette oi the United Statesi
would avoid, as far as poflible, the imputation
that has been frequently and juflly incurred upon
account of profellions. never fubjlantiated.
Should the Gazette of the United States
prove a faithful register of pubKck tranfattiom
especially tliofe of the great council of the nation'
,he FEDERAL LEGISLATURE ; he HOPESitwili
be patronized by those who feel interested in the
welfare of the union; the patriots and independnt
freemen of our country.
Should it contain a competent detail of foreiqi
and domeltic intelligence; revolutions in com.
merce ; discoveries in various parts of the globe
opening new sources of wealth to enterprizingad.
venturers ; rile and fall of flocks ; prices current
&c. he HOPES it will receive the support of
mercantile characters.
Should the great body of mechanics find that
their important interests are attended to ; thatim.
provements and discoveries in their several branch
es claim an early and conllant insertion.
Should this Gazette be the happy inftnim ;nt of
pointing out various plans, by which the niufic of
the AX and HAMMER may again be heard in our
cities, the Editor cannot but HOPE for their
generous encouragement.
Should fomethhig*worthy the notice of the great
farming interest of our country (the bulworkof
freedom and equal laws) be exhibited from time
to time, the editor HOPES for their patronage,
Improvements in agriculture are of thefirft: conse
quence to our young, our 1 iling country ; and the
labours that tend to affect this clefirable object, are
tlierefultof the purelt patriotism, and lliould de.
tnand the couftant attention of the Editors of pe.
riodical publication.
The Edit or HOPES that the wealtlfy part of the
community will become patrons of this publication,
as itisbutjuft toiay, that every project, which has
been obviouily calculated for publick utility, lias
met with prompt and generous encouragement from
those whom Providence has blefledwith affluence; ;â¢
without their aififlance,the noble plans now on foot
for the promotion of MANUFACTURES, ARTS
and SCIENCES, mult have proved abortive; their
liberal efforts 011 many recent occafons, have given
a spring to the publick mind. Should the Gazette .
of the United States suggest improvable hints, or
feazible projects, which mult depend npon the
PURSE for their maturity, it cannot fail of being
countenanced by the RICH and public spirited.
The and momentous fubjedt of Education
is hourly appreciating in its importance : Thatpart
of the NEW CONSTITUTION, which opens the
door to every man of every rank, poflefling VIRTUE
and ABILITIES, to the highest honours in the great
American Republick, has expanded the views of
every American.
This idea, places the bufinefsof Education in>
point of light, in which it never has before been
viewed; a point in which it cannot be confidcred
in any other country upon the face of the earth.
The MIDDLING and LOWER CLASS of CITI
ZENS will therefore find yheir account in becoming
fubferibers for this Gazette,fliould it pay a particu
lar regard to this great subject. Full jullice can
not perhaps be done to it; but every attempt to il
lustrate and enforce its importance, muftinfure the
applause of every person who feels the dignity of
a rational being, or who prizes the birthright of
an American.
Ignorance is the,parent of all human degrada
tion ; every attempt therefore to difleminate the 1
rays of knowledge will receive the applause of the
truly benevolent. The happiness of mankind fee
ing inseparably connected with the practice of re
ligious, moral and social duties, it becomes obli
gatory upon the Editors of publick papers, to pay
a diftinguiihed regard to every idea that may te
iuggefled upon these important points, npon gem
ral principles, avoiding tedious diflertations upon
aifiritfe and metaphysealfubjeifts, : Those eflaysthat
have anatural tendency to refine our manners, hu
manize the heart,alid exalt our natures,fhoulil claim
a cliftinguifhed attention. So far as the Gazette of
the United States shall be instrumental in diJufing
sentiments of justice, humanity and benevolenceâ
those great moral virtues, it will doubtless recei ,e
the support of the Reverend Clergy. i
In fhortjfhoulcl this Gazette support the character
of a NATIONAL, IMPARTIAL and INDEPEN
DENT CONVEYANCER to all parts of the Um
on, ofNews, Politics, and Miscellanies, theaap r ,
bation and patronage of a generous publick v
doubtless reward the exertions of
