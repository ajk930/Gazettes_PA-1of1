To the PUBLIC.
AT this important Crisis, the ideas that fill the mind, are preg
nant with Events of the greatest magnitudeâto strengthen and
complete the UNION of the Statesâto extend and protest their
COMMERCE, under equal Treaties yet to be formedâtc 'â¢xplon
and arrange the NATIONAL FUNDSâto restore and establish
the PUBLIC CREDITâand ALL under the aufpicesof an untri
ed System of Government, will require the ENERGIES of the
Patriots and Sages of our CountryâHence the propriety ef encreafing
the Mediums of Knowlege and Information.
AMERICA, from this period, begins a new Era in her nation
al existenceâ 41 th e world is all before her"âThe
wisdom and follyâthe mifcry and prosperity of the EMPIRES,
STATES, and KINGDOMS, which have had their day upon
the great Theatre of Time, and are now no more, suggest the moll
important MementosâThefc, with the rapid series of Events, in
which our own Country has been so deeply irttefefted, have
taught the enlightened Citizens of the United States, that FREE
DOM and GOVERNMENTâLIBERTY and LAWS, are inse
parable.
This Conviction has led to the adoption of the New Conflitut.i
---on; for however, various the Sentiments, refpccling the ML.
-RITS of this Syflcm, all good men are agreed in the neceflity
that exists, of an EFFICIENT FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.
A paper, therefore, established upon NATIONAL % INDE
PENDENT, and IMPARTIAL PRINCIPLESâwhich (hall
take up the premised Articles, upon a competent plan, it is
presumed, will be highly intcrefling, and meet with public ap
probation and patronage.
The Editor of this Publication is determined to leave no avenoe
of informaton unexplored :âHe solicits the aflifltnce of Persons
of lcifurc and abilitiesâwhich, united with his own afTiduity, he

POSTSCRIPT.
SIX Months have now elapsed since this paper was ushered
into exigenceâhow far the ff)irit of the plan has been exhibited, and
adhered to, is not for the Editor to fay.âA generous and candid pub
lic has awarded its approbation, b\ a fubfeription which is said to be
wore extensive than usual on Jimi/ar cxcafionsâ¢ âAn acknowledgement of
the favor is therefore due from the publisher.âThe expence attending an
undertaking of this kind is always great; in the prejent inflance, it has
not been counterbalanced by any of the cujlomary receipts on account of
tdxxrtifemcnti âthe objefl being an extensive circulation, the Editor con
ceiving that their insertion wonld have counteracted that part of his plan,
has ncm admitted any. This consideration if it was necejfary to be
f u W.fled,would point out the importance of punfluality on the part of the
fubferibers âit appears to have neen very generally a'.tended to, as th*
Payments have been unusually prompt.
its? necejfary to observe that the number of names which have honored
thefubfoiption, is not fufjicient to defray the expence of the publication,
a nJto afford the Editor a competent support, on a f"ppofition that the
who/ejlouldbe colleÃed.âAdditional fubferiptions are therefore folic it ed;
*nd when it is considered, t'vt the paper is new til its ccnjlruftwn ; con
tains intelligence ofthemofl interesting nature ; abounds with more ori
ginality than any other periodical publication ; and, viewed as a mif
cetlany, is cheaper than any magazine, regifler, i3c. it can not be doubted
fat that it will receive an adequate patronage.
, I* the present number, the publication of the Journals of the Senate
is commenced. As there is no gallery to the Senate Chamber, all that
can be known of the proceedings of that Mojl Honorable branch of th?
Actional Legiflature,is from theit Journals ; in this view of the fubjetl,it
is fiipofedthey will be interejling to thepuhlic. The price of the laws and
th Journals cf the two Houses only, which will be given in the course
V one year, amounts to more than the fubfeription.
The Editor is determined to prcfecute the publication, upon its origi

THE TABLE T.âNo. LVII.
" The inflinfl of sovereignty in our nature, am.
the waywardness of infanti which is the consequence
of it, discover themselves with the leajl glimmering of
underflanding ; and those children, which are mojl
ncgJetted and the leaf} taught, are always the mofl
jlubborn and obflinate ; and none are more unruly or
fonder of following their own will, than those that are
least capable of governing themselves
T HAVE, in more than one of my specula-
A tions, offered remarks much of the fame
nature with those contained in this number. The
subject, in my apprehension of it, is an intereft
ingone. Wherever we turn our eyes, we behold
striking demonstrations, that all men arc i>i nature
tyrants. It is so universal and instinctive a pro
pensity, as justly to be denominated one of the
llrongeft characteristics of human nature. If I
am enquired of, why I endeavor to enforce so
evident a truth, I will inform the reader, thrit it
is not so much to fix the doctrine itfelf, as to de
duce some ufeful inferences.
Men are perpetually calling government -a ne
ceflary evil. The epithet is not fairly applied.
Government is instituted as a remedy against an
unavoidable evil, which exists in the natural con
stitution of man. It is true the remedy does not
always produce the full effect intended ; but it is
only becanfe the evil is too deeply fixed to admit
of a cure. Government must not therefore itfelf
be called an evil, merely because there are some
evils, which it has not power to remove. If so
ciety is opprefled with tyranny, or agitated with
sedition, it only fliews that the lusts and paflions
of men are not altogether restrained by civil in
fti tut ions. Men are acting agreeably to the im
pulse of their nature. The government under
which such mifchiefs happen is not capable of
controling entiiely the excefles to which men are
naturally prone. The enormities however would
be tar greater, were they not subject to some re
flraint, by the operation of the government. We
are too fond of paying compliments to human
nature, and therefore transfer the blame from
ourselves to causes where it should not be fixed.
Man must be made an artificial being before it
can be fafe living with him. This inculcates the
neceflity of education. Ignorance is the founda
tion of molt of the political calamities whichever
overwhelmed the world. Ido not mean that ig
norant men have done the mifchief. They have
only fuffered it to be done. Wicked and artful
men, which are always to be found in all situations
of society, can give scope to their inclinations,
where the people are untaught in moral duties
and civil privileges. Unless men are ignorant
and unenlightened, no monstrous ihifcbief can
take place ; and in this view, ignorance may be
said to be the foundation of all political evil.â
There can be no danger of losing liberty where
the people have knowlege. A wife community
guards itfelf equally against tyrants and Incendiar
ies ; and it like wife guards individuals against the
oppressions which they are, by nature, prone to
exercise over one another. In such a situation
the positive hlelftngs of government are appar
ent ; because civilized, well-informed men are
capable of being well-governed. In a worse state
of society, men are a greater evil to each other,
and therefore they call the government an evil,
by way of compliment to themselves.
It is of importance that mankind become fenfi
ble of this truth ; that bad men can never have
a good government, and that men always will be
bad, till laws and education make them good.â
Nothingplaces the advantages of good laws and
institutions in a stronger point of light, than that
they are capable of encreafing the desire to pos
sess property, at the fame time that they create an
abhorrence to acquire it unjustly. In a state of
nature, the desires of a man are few, and it is well
they are so ; for few as they are, he often com
mits terrible outrages to gratify them. In a state,
any degree civilized, it is true the appetites of a
man are more keen, and the objects of his wishes
more numerous, and they fafely may be so ; for
he will seldom dare or desire to lay violent or un
just hands on the property of another, for the fake
of encreafing his own. And yet there are many
people who are incessantly stigmatizing govern
ment with odious epithets. If men will look in
to the subject, and trace effects to their proper
source, they will know better by what names to
call things.

MR. ADAMS'S LETTERS.
LETTER V.
Amsterdam, Oct. g, i 790.
SIR,
fifth enquiry is, " Whether a voluntary re-
A " volt of any one or more of the States in the
" American Confederation is to he apprehended : And.
" if one or more mere to revolt, whether the others
" -would not he able to defend themfslves ?"
This is a very judicious and material question.
I conceive that the answer to it is easy and deci
sive. T here is not the least danger of a voluntary
revolt of any one State in the Union. It is diffi
cult to prove a negative, however ; and (till more
difficult to prove a future negative. Let us, how
ever, conlfder the subject a little.
Which State is the moil likely to revolt, orfub
mit ? Is it the uioft ancient colony, as Virginia,
or the Maflachufetts ? Is it the moll numerous
and powerful, as Virginia, Mallachufetts, orPenn
fylvania ? I believe nobody will fay, that any one
of tliefe great States will take the lead in a revolt,
or a voluntary submission.
Will it be the smallest and weakest States, that
will be molt likely to give up voluntarily ? In or
der to fatisfy ourselves of this, let us consider
what has happened ; and by the knowlege of
what has palled, we may judge of what is to come.
The three smallest States are Rhode-Island,
Georgia, and Delaware.
The Englifli have plainly had it in view ta
bring one of these States toa fubmiflion, and have
accordingly direcfted very great forces againlt
them.
Let us begin with Rhode-Island. In the latter
end of the year 1776, General Howe sent a large
army of near seven thousand men, by sea, under
aftrong convoy of men of war, detached' by Lord
Howe, to take pofleflion of Newport, the capital
of Rhode Island. Newport Hands upon an island,
and was neither fortified nor garrisoned fufficient
ly to defend itfelf againftfo powerful a fleet and
army, and therefore the Englifli made themselves
malters of the place. But what advantage did
they derive from it ? Did the colony of Rhode-
Island', small as it is, submit ? So far from it,
that they were rendered the more eager to refill ;
and an army was aflembled at Providence, which
confined the English to the prison of Rhode-Island,
until the fall of the year r779, when they were
obliged to evacuate it, and our army entered it
in triumph.
The next little State which the Englifli attempt
ed was Delaware. This State confilts of three
counties only, situated upon the river Delaware,
below Philadelphia, and is most exposed to the
English men of war of any of the States, because
they are open to invallon not only upon the ocean,
but all along the river Delaware. It contains not
more than thirty thousand fouls. When the Elig
lifh got pofleflion of Philadelphia, and had the
command of the whole navigation of the Dela
ware, these people were more in the power of the
Englifli than any part of America ever was, and
the Englifli generals, admirals, commanders, and
all the tories, used all their arts to seduce this lit
tle State ; but they could not suCceed ; they never
could get the appearance of a government erecled
under the King's authority.âThe people con
tinuedtheir delegation in Congress, and conti
nued to elecft their Governors, Senate, and Aflein
blies, under their new conflitution, and to furnifh
their quota to the continental army, and their
proportion to the militia, until the English were
obliged to evacuate Philadelphia.âThere are
besides, in this little State, from various causes,
more tories, in proportion, than in any other.
And as this State flood immoveable, I think we
have no reason to fear a voluntary submission of
any other.
The next small State that was attempted was
Georgia.âThis State is situated at the southern
extremity of all, and at such a distance from all
the reft, and such difficulties of communication,
being above an hundred miles from Charleston,
in South-Carolina, that it was impoflible for the
neighbouring States to afford them any assistance.
The English invaded this little State, and took
the Capital, Savanna, and have held it to this day :
But this acquisition has not been followed by any
fubmiflion of the province ; on the contrary, they
continue their delegates in Congress, and their
new officers of government. This province,
moreover, was more immediately the child of
England than any other ; the settlement of it cost
England more than all the reft, from whence one
might expecft they would have more friends here
than any where.
New-Jersey is one of themiddling-fized
âNew-Jersey had a large British army in Phila
delphia, which is on one fide of them, and ano
ther in New-York, which is the other fide, andI
tlieÃritiflv army lias marched qufte through it;
Sad the Engliih have used every policv of flattery,
of terror, and severity, but nil in vain, and wovfe
than in vain ; ail has confpii ed to make the people
of New-jc !'ey foine of the moll brave and Jkilful
to resist them.
New-York, before the commencement of hos
tilities,was supposed to be the moii luke warm of
the middle States, in the opposition to the de
signs of the Engliih. The Engliih armies have
invaded it from Canada and from the ocean, and
have long been in pofleffionof three.islands, New-
York Island, Long-lfland, and Staten-lfland ; yet
the relt of that Province has flood immoveable,
through all the varieties of the fortune of war, for
four years, and increases in zeal and unanimity
every year.
I think, therefore, there is not apoffibility, that
any one of the Thirteen States ihould ever volun
tarily revolt or fnbmit.
The efforts and exertions of General Howe, in
New-York, Loiig-Jlland, Staten-lfland, New-Jer
sey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Maryland, to
obtain recruits; the vail expence that he put his
pav-mafter to in appointing new corps of officers,
even general officers: the pains they took to in
iift men, among all the llragglers of those coun
tries, and among many thousands of prisoners
which they then had in their hands ; âall these
jneafures obtaining buj three thousand fix hundred
men, and very few of these Americans, accord
ing to General Howe's own account,ihews, 1 think,
to a demonstration, that no voluntary revolt or
fubmiflion is ever to be apprehended.
But even supposing Rhocle-Ifland ihould submit,
what could this small colony of fifty thousand fouls
do, in the midil of Maflachufetts, Connecticut,
and New-Hampshire ?
Supposing Delaware, thirty thousand fouls,
ihould submit, what influence could it have upon
the great States of New-Jersey, Pennsylvania,
Maryland, and Virginia, among which it lies ?
If Georgia, at the extremity of all, ihould sub
mit, what influence could this little society of
thirty thousand fouls have upon the two Caro
linas and Virginia ? The colonies are at such
vast distances from one another, and the country
is so fortified every where, by rivers, mountains,
and forefts, that the conqueftor fubmillion of one
part has no influence upon the reft.
I have the honor to be, See.

E ROPE AN INTELLIGENCE.
LONDON, August 12.
The Britons of France, in whose country the
city of Nantz lies, appear wifely to be as careful
â¢t the rights of the Crown, as they are of the rights
of the People; and to be as ready to support the
former, as they are determined to maintain the
latter.
Carefully avoiding the wild chimeras of mo
dern reformers, who would either abolish mon
archy totally, or leave it a mere empty name, they
think the prerogatives of the Crown not only com
patible with the liberties of the people, but abso
lutely netelfary to the preservation of those liber
ties.
They also take care, left certain revolutionists
Ihould luffer themselves to be carried away by no
tions of ambition, that they abliortlie idea of tak
ing the crown from him who at present wears it,
or from those upon whom the inheritance of it is
entailed by law.
A short extraift from the Nantz address will
clearly (hew both their wisdom and their spirit:â
The city of Nantz having had the advantage
of being one of the firft in the kingdom, to raise
its voice to claim and allcrt the unalienable rights
of the people, feels itfelf bound to manifelt, in
the molt striking manner, its attachment to the
privileges which the National Allembly has so
nobly and so courageoully aflerted.
'< It therefore eagerly embraces this opportu
nity to declare, that it adopts, and will moil: fted
faft'ly adhere to, not only yourrefolution of the
17th of June, but to all those that followed it.
" That the interest of the people ofthis coun
try is inseparable from that of their Sovereign,
and that they never will be able to (hake off the
yoke under which they have 1b long groaned, but
by giving the greatell vigour to the executive pow
er, the citizens of Nantz 1 wear upon the Altar of
"''eir Country, in the presence of the dreadful
and common Judge both of Kings and Subjects,
that they will maintain the Royal Authority be
longing to the Crown, and will refill, to the ut
most of their power, the attempts of those who
may be daring enough to wiili to divide it with any
body of men whatever.
" Full of gratitude to a long line of Kings,
who strove to break the chains made for man in
mges of barbarism, and to reltore him to the dig
nity of his natureâ
" Penetrated with the 1110 ft profound refpeft
for the virtues of the beneficent Prince who has
restored to France her National Aflemblies and
*<ho feels that the rights of the Crown, and the
rights and property of the fubjei t, ft and upon one
and the fame foundationâthe Citizens of Nantz
hilU'Judt their Representatives to proclaim the re
fpeclful homage of their inviolable loyalty and
fidelity to the Family upon the Throne, and their
love for the Patriot King whom God has given
them.
" They raise their hands to Heaven, and thus
solemnly swear, that they are ready to facrifice
their fortunes, and to lpill even the lalt drop of
their blood, to maintain the fcepterin the House
of Bourbon.
" In the fame manner, they solemnly swear,
that they are ready to make the fame facrifices to
support the refolutioiis of your augult Ailembly,
and to defend the liberty of the French Nation,
whose greatelt enemies have been the enemies of
Kings.
" They call for vengeance on the heads of those
who are wicked enough to calumniate a loyal na
tion, and a faithful people.
" The Citizens of Nantz think it a sacred duty
to pay homage to the zeal, the underltanding, and
patriotism of the National Alfembly.
" Should attempts he made to lay snares round
you, or to stagger you either by terror of menaces,
or the fed uc r tion of intrigue, look behind you, and
you will fee twenty-five millions of people, with
their eyes fixed upon you, and waiting in silence
to hear from you what is to be their lot, and that
of their posterity.
" At this fight, your courage rising to the dig
nity of the augnft character, no less sacred than
that of the prielthood, with which your Country
has invefteti you, you will (light all menaces and
feduiftion in contemplating themajefty of the firlt
People in the Universe.
" You will think then only of the bleflings that
will attend you when you return individually
among your fellow citizens, to proclaim their re
covered liberty, and the beneficent a&s of a be
loved Sovereign, who cannot long be deceived.â
" Who, emulous of the glory of Louis XII, and
of his own renowned ancestor Henry IV. and wish
ing to tread their steps, feels the true greatness
of a Monarch is to reign over a free people.
" In a word, who knows that the law, that
emanation of Divine Wisdom, ought to be refpedt
ed by Sovereigns theinfelves, if they know their
own interests."
At the late infurreflions in France very naturally oc
cupy all convcrfation, this Jhort Jketch of the Royal
family of that Kingdom may not be unacceptable to
the generality of the public :
Louis XVI is now about thirty-three years of
age ; he ascended the throne of his grand-father
about seventeen, and shortly afterwards married
a filter of the present Emperor of Germany.
When he was firft married, he was thin to a
degree of particular observation ; but being na
turally of a mild, quiescent temper, and indulg
ing in the pleasures of the table, he is now, per
haps one of the fatteft men in his dominions.
To counteract this in some degree, he rises ear
ly, and almost daily takes the diversion of the
chace ; but from dinner till bed-time indulges,
with the intervention of hardly any other buli
nefs than the signing dispatches, See.
He has had four children, two of whom are
lead. His present family consists of the Dauphin,
x child of about fix yeais old, and a princess.
The Oueen is nearly about the King's age, has
much majesty and vivacity in her port, and is on
the whole reckoned one of the fineft women in
France.
Monsieur, the King's next brother, is nearly
is fat as the Sovereign, and was in the beginning
as the present troubles rather a favorite with the
people.
The Count d'Artois, the King's second brother,
isa tall, well-moulded, elegant figure, with much
vivacity and deciiion in his character. He ren
iered himfelf unpopular in the firft meeting of
:he Notables, and seems to have increased that
unpopularity to a degree of proscription.
The Court part) has for several years back
been ealled the Queen's, aided by the Count
d'Artois : these two were said to have the 1110 ft
prevailing influence on the King in all his mea
sures.
September 3. It excites our wonder when we
consider that among two Uncles and three Royal
Brothers, there is not one ofthem whole prudence
or (Economy circumscribes his expences within his
Princely income : The world seems at present to
be in a very ticklish humour.âThey should con
template ferioully on the uncertainty of human
events, from the examples at present before them
in France, and view with trembling eyes the im
mense debt this Kingdom groans under :âTo
feed the liypocondriac, and not at all to check the
high spirit of unthinking Demigods.

M. le Chapelliere President of the National altfembly.

of France have been marked with the fame fea
turesâthat the French Nation may be as happy
in eftablifliing a Constitution as their allies the
United States of America have been, who now
enjoy the compltte operation of a fyltem ofgovern
:nent which has aftoniihed Europeâdrawn from
its most celebrated Civilians the highelt encom
iums, and is calculated to promote not only the
happiness, honor, and glory of the Unionâbat
eflentially to promote the Rights of Mankind.
The Hall of the elegant edifice known by thÂ«
name of Faneuil-Hallâwas previous to the war,
ornamented with the portraits of several digni
fied personages which were either destroyed or
taken away by the British, in the time of the
liege ; âone of them was the full length of
George 11, King of Great Britain, which was
placed before the middle window at the weft end
of the Hall.
Would it not be a lively and exprefliveteftimo
nial of our regard and veneration for the illultri
ous personage, who is momently expetfted to ho*
nor this town with his prefenceâfor the town to
request their committee to prepare an address, to
express a desire that the Prefidentof the United
States, would be plealed to permit our ingenious
townsman and refpeifted portrait painter (Mr.
Johnson) to wait on him for the purpole of tak
ing an exact and full length portrait to be put m
the fame place where the portrait ot the King
of Great Britain formerly was ; which would a

NEW-YORK, OCTOBER 28.
AUTHENTIC INFORMATION.
By Capt. Carpenter, who arrived here yester
day, in 7 days from Savanna, in Georgia, advices
are received, which state that the Coinmffioners
from the United States for negociating with the
Southern Indians have been disappointed in not
heingable to effetfl a Treaty. The caufesof this
failure are not mentioned.
Capt: Burbeck's company which escorted the
Commissioners on this occasion, were expected to
embark for New-York, on board Capt. ScheiM
er ho rn, the 20th inft. and may be daily expected.
IT appears by the papers from Boston, that the
inhabitants of that town are making the greatell
preparation to express their refped: to the llluftri
ous President of the United States onhis arrival.
A grand procession has been determined on, and
the several trades have prepared their rsfpeftive
(tandards for the occasion. At a late Town Meet
ing the Hon. Judge Sullivan fuggelted the propri
ety of erecting a permanent Triumphal Arch at
the entrance of the Town to remain a lading me
morial of this pleasing event.
On this happy occasion all party diftin<ftions
have fubfuled ; all ranks are emulous to express
their feelings in the molt unequivocal, and loyal
teltimonials of attachment to the DELIVERER
OF THEIR COUNTRY, wliofe approach likethe
glorious luminary of Heaven, appears to have
totally diflipated the fog ofantifederalifin.
We hear from Rhode-Island that at their late
sessions of Assembly, held at Newport, a bill was
introduced and palled into a law for collecting a
Revenue, said to be nearly similar to that of the
United Statesâthe duties payable in solid coin.
At the fame time they made a new establishment
of revenue officers, and formed the State into dif
tridls. These proceedings are considered there
as an indireifl step of the Anties towards a union
with their filter States : Moil of the new appoint
ed officers have been violent in their oppolition
to the Federal Government, having made loud
complaints that the fees established by Congress
were exorbitant and opprelfive ; but iince their
appointment their tune is much alteredâthey be
gin to think tliemfelves very suitable persons to
hold the fame polls under the New Government
when that State comes into the Union. Notwith
flandingthey have paper money at command they
appear to be very tond of a little hard caih, and
collecft it with severity from the velFels which
bring wood, brick, and fifh, into their State, to
supply the sea port towns with those articles,
making them pay considerable fees in gold and
(liver. -How can such a description of men have
the presumption to think that Congress will con
tinue them in the Rations they now hold, when
that State lliall accede to the general government >
Rather may it be supposed that men who have been
aidingand supporting an iniquitous fyltem of go
vernment in their State, which has defrauded the
widow, the fatlierlefs children, and the honelt
creditor, of their property, will be considered as
unfui table persons to be employed in polls of ho
nor and responsibility under a wife and good go
vernment.
A happy revolution of fentimentis observed to
have taken place throughout the United States
Local views, and narrow prejudices are univer
sally reprobated.âA generous, national fpiiit,
pervades the whole Union : Formerly we used to
call ourselves Engliflimen, Germans, Irishmen,
Scotchmen, &c. according to the Country from
whence we respectively originatedâbut now,
even the diftimftions of States are scarcely heard
âand like other Great Nations, who have rlfen
to Fame aud Empire, we are proud to be diftin
euiflied by the name of the Country we inhabit,
AMERICANSâa name that shall ere long be more
desired, and confcr greater honor, than that of
ROMAN ever did.
Some persons have affected to deny that the
flame of Liberty which burst out in America,
has had any influence in enlightening European
nations on this divine fubjecftâbut abundant evi
dence in proof of the fai't can be adduced.âlre
land encouraged, and animated by our example,
and success, very early began to aflert the claims
of humanity ; and by the efforts of her patriots,
has rescued inr.ny invaluable rights from the
clutches of tyranny.âlt is inconceivable v,.th
what avidity tiie llory of the American revolution
has been read in Franceâtranslations of Ameri
can publications have been circulated in all parts
of that kingdom ; and turning the current ot Itu
dy, and ("peculation into an investigation of the
general, legal, and f'ocial rights ot man, has en
abled her men of genius toaltonifli the world by
the result of their rel'earthes âthe patriots ot
France, for leveral years pad, have been indefa
tigable in difleminating political knowledge a
mong the people ât-every well written tieatiie has
been obtained from England, and America and
no expence spared to have them translated and
circulated.âAmong ether valuable books, the
' Defence ofthe American Constitutions
was very early introduced into that kingdom,
and contributed not a little to that bh:ze ot free
dom, and patriotism, which bids fair to consume
the whole system of tyranny âroot and brancn.
America may indulge a laudable pride on tliisoc
cafionâfar the conduct of her illuttrioti' allies i*
a moll glorious elogium 011 her own. i lie world
is altoniflied at the displays of political know lege,
and informationâthe jultnefs, boldness, and in
dependency of sentiment which charaeterife the
proceedings of the national allembly, and the
speeches of many individuals ot that truly pa
triotic and enlightened body of men. âBut the
foregoing sketch may in lome meal are account
for it : for although in point of genius, and
greatness of original conception, the \ rench na
tion is equal to any under heaven, yet doubtless
Ihe has derived immense advantages from her
neighbours, and particularly from this country.
Like America, France appears to conlider that
freedom can be fafe only under the auspices of :i
good constitutionâto this objedt her labors tend,
may fhs be so fortunate as to establish one equal
ly free with that, with which Heaven has blelled
this highly favoured country.
While the spirit of freedom is diffufing its be
nign influences over those countries where des
potism in its most horrid forms once reprelled
every noble aiid generous exertion of the human.
mindâmay America exult that the perils of her
conflitfl in the fame arduous cause have terminat
ed so glorioufly âmay she be wife to secure to
herfelr and posterity the hard earned purchase of
a ten years fuccefsful struggle " peace, liber
ty, and safety," under the auspices ofa good
government âIn vain has lhe fought, and con
quered, if her toils are not to have thisiflue In
vain has ftie expended blood, and treasure, if
when her external enemies are subdued, and dri
ven from her coasts, the reltlefs sons of anarchy,
and ft rife, fliall blalt her profpecfts, by fomenting
internal difTentions. _
It would be a " retrogradal" Hep indeed, if af
ter we have piloted the political ship into port,
we fliould again commit her to the mercy of the
boisterous elements, without fails, rudder or sea
menâbut this seems to be the objeel of some ol
the crew, who because they had lungs to pipe aj
hands, conceived their nautical abilities equal to
the fir ft offices on board, and because the voyage
though prosperous has ended without their par
ticular advice, or concurrence, they are for lett
ing every thing a float againâand pushing oil 01.1
another expedition.
The English turn every thing into sterlingâ

By this means strangers travelling in the United

to conhder himfelf a citizen of 110 one nation, but

favored people of the Almighty Father. It is true
you are not richâneither are you poorâthere is
more poverty and diftrcfs in a single city of Eu

Every honest man may live in a state of compe
