" The Kmperor Morocco's troops have gained
a great victory over the Arabs, in the province
of Teifna, and 600 of their heads have been fern
to Algiers This victory was proclaimed thereby
repeated discharges of cannon."
To the account of the battle between the Ruf
fians and Swedes at Undermalm, we have to add
these farther particulars. At the departure of the
Courier which carried the news of the KinoV vic
tory,the Kingwas on his route to Wilinanftrandt,
the place where the Rullians keep their principal
magazines, and which commands an entranceinto
their country. In the mean time, General Sie
grotli advanced with another corps towards Fre
dericklham to block up that place by land, while
General Kaulbars, with a tliird detachment went
up the river Kymene ; and Count Ekrenfward
was ordered to land from his fleet, a body of
5000 men, between Frederickfham and Hogforb,
to attack the Ruffian army, near the firft men
tioned place. From these different arrangements,
this campaign promises to be as bloody and deci
sive as the last was peaceable.
AUGUST 8.
The following is reported to be the circum
stance to which the Duke of Dorset alludes, in
the second paragraph of his letter to the Count de
Montmorin :âThe nobility of Brittany have ne
ver sent deputies to the National Aflembly, but
perceiving the troubles which were brewing, and
torefeeing the consequences which have ref'ulted,
they resolved to seize an opportunity of shaking
offtheir allegiance to France, and rendering that
Province more independent than it had hitherto
been.
For that pnrpofe, rumour fays, they made a
proposal to the English Ambaflador, of putting
themselves under the protection of Great-Britain,
as a tributary Hate, to be governed by the old
feudal system ; and offered to place the port of
Brest in the hands of the English, as a recompence
for their services, and a surety of allegiance. In
order to accomplish their design, the Duke of Dor
set was to procure from his Court a fleet in readi
ness to protecfl the Province, and an armytoaffift
them in their endeavours to carry the attempt in
to execution.
Extra(} from the JOURNAL of the NATIONAL
ASSEMBLY of FRANCE.
July 29,
A report was made in the Aflembly, that the
Parliament ofÃefancon had sent a deputation to
Vezoul, toa<ft with the Judge Royal in enquiring
into the late horrid maifacre, but that the people
had ri fen upon them and obliged them to return,
that, in consequence, the Parliament had iflueÂ»
an arret, renouncing their jurifditftion, and hM
submitted the affair entirely to the consideration
of the National Assembly.
July 31.
The following motion made by Count Laliy>
in the National Aflembly, the 24th of July
and carried at one o'clock (aftermidnight) niuf
give a very favorable opinion of the head arm
heart of thatyoungNobleman, who makes sod) â 
tinguifhed a figure among the patriots of trance
'l he motion was as follows :
" The National Aflembly, considering, 1 3 J
from the firft moment of its formation, it has 110
adopted any resolution, that ought not to p lO
cure it the confidence of the people.
" Thar it has already established thole p nciples, which ought to be the bafts, on Which thfi
liberty and happiness of die public muftbe raifecl.
" That the King has acquired greater rights
than ever to the confidence of his faithful T'ub
je<fts.
" That not only he has hinjfelf invited them
to claim their liberty and their rights, but has al
so, to gratify thewifhes ofthis Alieinbly, remov
ed all grounds for diflruit, that might alarm the
people â
" That he fentback from the capital, the troops,
whose presence had spread a terror through it
" That he lent back from his presence the Mi
nisters and advisers, who had occalioned so much
inquietude to the nation at largeâ
" That he has recalled thole, whose return
was wilhed for by his peopleâ
" That he came into this Aflembly like a fa
tlier among his children, and called upon it to
assist him in saving the Stateâ
" That led by the fame sentiment, he went ro
Iris capital, and mixed with his people, to re
move, by his presence, the grounds of fear, which
they might have entertainedâ
" That in this perfect harmony and under
standing between the head of the Nation and its
representatives, after the happy union of the
three orders, the attention ofthis Aflembly is di
rected, and will continue to be directed to the
oreat objecft of a National Conllitutionâ
" That any diftrulV, which should interrupt or
disturb the harmony, that at present so happily
reigns between all the orders and their head,
would impede the progress of this great work,
defeat the patriotic intentions of the King, and
give a fatal blow to the general intcrelV of the
Nation at large, as well as to the particular inte
rest of every individual, of whom it is composed.
" That there is riot a member of the commu
nity who ought not tofhudder at the bare idea
of the confuhon that would ensue.âThe difper
llon of familiesâthe interruption and suspension
of tradeâthe poor deprived of reliefâall labor at
a standâand the general subversion of all order
and government, would be the fatal but inevita
ble conl'equences of such a distrust.
" The National Aflembly taking all these cir
cumstances into its molt serious consideration,
holds out to the whole Nation an invitation to
peace and harmony, to the maintenance of order
and good government. It invites tliofe who glo
ry in the name of Frenchmen, to clierilh that
confidence which they ought to place in their
King andtheir Representatives, and ro fljew that
refpet't for the laws, without which there can be
no true liberty.
" It declares, at the fame time, that tliofe who,
invested with power have been, or by their crimes
may be the cause of public calamities, ought to be
accused, convicted, and punished ; but that it is
only by law thatthey should be tried and punish
ed, and that the law should protect their per
sons, until it has pronounced their judgment.
" That the prosecution of crimes against the
Nation, belongs to the Nation's Representatives.
" And that this Aflembly, in framing the Con
stitution which now occupies its attention, will
take care to provide a proper tribunal, for the
trial of persons accused of crimes of this nature ;
and to point out the manner in which such pro
fccutions /hall be condmfted, laying it down as a
principle, that publicity shall be inseparably an
nexed to all such trials."
The fentiinents and opinions contained in this
resolution or address to the nation, are not tliofe
of a mad reformer, more intent npon pulling
down than building up âThey are worthy of a
Philosopher and a Legislator, who knows that
where there is 110 Law, there can be no govern
mentâthat innocence itfelf may be termed guilt
l>y a mad populace, too much heated to be capa
ble ofdifcerningbetween the one and the other,
or at least of giving that calm and patient hear
mgwhich Justice calls for, and the Law enjoins.
This resolution, if it was the only one praise
worthy in the political careerof Count Lally,
would, even singly, be an eternal monument to
his honor.

DESCRIPTION Of THE B A STILE.
The following Description of the Baflilc PriJo>:,
in France (which has lately been destroyed by
the populace) is extracted from the philanthro
pic Mr. Howard's State of Foreign Prisons.
I AM happy (fays Mr. Howard) to be able
to give some information of the Baftile, by means
of a pamphlet written by aperfon who was long
confined in this prison. It is reckoned the beil
account of this celebrated ftruiiture everpublifhed.
This castle is a Urate prison, confiding of eight
very strong towers, surrounded with a f'ofle about:
120 feet wide, and a wall 60 feet high. The en
trance is at the end of the street of Sr. Antoine,
by a drawbridge, and great gates into the court
of 1' Hotel du Government ; and from thence over
another drawbridge to the Corps de Garde, which
is separated by a ftroijg barrier, conftm<fted with
beams plated with iron, from the great Court.
This court is about 120 feet by 80. In it is a foun
tain, and fix of the towers surround it, which are
united by walls of freeflone ten feet thick up to
the top. At the bottom of this courtls a large
modern Corps de Logis, which separates it from
t lie Court du Puits. This court is 50 feet by 2J.
Contiguous to it are the other two towers. Oil
the top of the towers is a platform continued in.
terraces, on which the prisoners are sometimes
permitted to walk, attended by a guard. On
this platform are thirteen cannons mounted,which
are discharged on days of rejoicing. In the Corps
de Logis is the council chamber, and the kitchen,
offices, See.âabove these arerQoms for the priso
ners of diftintftion ; and over the council chamber
the King's Lieutenant relides. In the Court du
Puits is a large well for the use of the kitchen.
The Dungeons of the tower de la Liberte ex
tend under theâ¢ kitchen, &c. Near that tower
is a small chapel on the ground floor. In the
wall of it are five nitches, orclofets, in which pri
soners are put, one by one, to hear mass, where
they can neither fee nor befeen.
The dungeons at the bottom of the towers ex
hale the molt offenfive scents, and are the recep
tacles of toads, rats, and other kinds of vermin.
111 the corner of each is a camp made of
planks laid 011 iron bars that are fixed to the walls,
and the prisoners are allowed fomeftrawto lay on
the beds. Those dens are dark, having 110 win
dows, but openings into the ditch : they have dou
ble doors, the inner ones plated with iron, with
large bolts and locks.
Of the five clafles of chambers, the 1110 ft horrid,
next to the dungeon, are those in which are cages
of iron. There are three of them. They are
formed of beams with strong plates of iron, and
are each eight feet by fix.
The calottes, or chambers, at the top of the
towers, are somewhat more tolerable. They are
formed of eight arcades of free-ftones. Here
one can not walk but in the middle of the room.
There is hardly fufficient space for a bed from
one arcade to another. The â windows, beinÂ«;i;i
walls ten feet thick, and having iron grates with
in and without, admit but little light. In these
rooms, the heat is exceflive in fu:nmer, and the
cold in winter. They have ftovee.
Almost all the other rooms (of the towers) are
ocflagons, about 20 feet in diameter, and 14 to 1;
high. They are very cold and damp. Each is
furnifhed with a bed of green serge, &c. All the
chambers are numbered. The prisoners are call
ed by the name of their tower joined to the num
ber of their room.
A surgeon and three chaplains reside in the
castle. If prisoners of note are dangerously ill,
they are generally removed, that they may not
die in this prison. The prisoners who die there
are buried in the parifli of St. Paul, under the
name of doineftics.
A library was founded by a prisoner, who was
a foreigner, and died in the Baftile the beginning
of the present century. Some prisoners obtain
permission to make the use of it.
One of thecentinels on the inside of the castle
rings a bell every hour, day and night, to give
notice that they are awake ; and on the rounds 011
the outside of the castle they ring every quarter
of an hour.
I have (fay Mr. Howard) inserted so particular
an account of this prison, chiefly with the design
of inculcatinga reverence for the principles of a
free constitution like our own, which will not
permit in any degree the exercise of that defpo-r
tifm, which has rendered the name of Baftile so
formidable. I was defirousof examining it my
felf ; and for that purpose knocked hard at the
outer gate, and immediately went forward
through the guard to the drawbridge before the
entrance of the castle ; but while I was contem
plating this gloomy mansion, an officer came out
much i'urprized ; and I was forced to retreat
through the mute guard, and thus obtained hat
freedom, which for one locked up within those
walls, itis next to impoflible to obtain.

To the AUTHOR of the TABLET,
SIR.
If theenclofedobfervationsarenot novel, they
are at leall founded on expc ricnce :âlf you think
they may be ufeful, allow them a place in your
miscellany, and oblige C.
'' Ufefid and important acquisitions in learning arc more to be
prized t than thofc that are specious, and may nevet turn to any
iolid account."
ALTHO an easy elocution, and graceful
manlier of speaking are acquirements of acknow
ledged utility, yet improvements in oratory do
not appear to have kept pace wiih many other
branches of the bell e lettres. Some have fnppofed
that there are certain obltacles in the way, which
will forever, pyevent the moderns from rivalling
or even equalling the ancients in this particular
attainment. It is said, that the refinements of ci
vilization counteract, and check those animated
exertions of the human faculties, from which the
imprelfive eloquence of the ancients derives its su
perior reputation. However true this may be,
it mull" be allowed that 110 one accompliihmentis
more admired, or is found of greater advantage
to the pofleflor, even in modern times, than
an easy, graceful mode of speaking : And it is
presumed the observation is founded on experi
ence, that in all free governments the perfualive
powers of eloquence are paramount to every dif
ficulty in the road to fame and fortune. America
furnilhes many striking examples in point. In
Britain they are numberless : Her Pulteneys,
her Pitts, her Burkes, have not only aftoniih
ed the world by the thunders of their declama
tions ; but have roused the sleeping genius of
their country and turned the crisis of its fate,
when 011 the verge of deftrudtion. Honours and
emoluments have rewarded their eloquence and
patriotism.
The old observation, that "Poets are born, but
" orators are made," is fofarjuft, that every
man may be encouraged to exej-tion, from a con
fidence that he will be rewarded, at lealt so far,
as amply to recompence his labor. Perhaps it is
. hardly ever too late to aim at some improvement.
Within a few years public speaking has become
an objeift of attention in schools, academies, and
colleges. It is a queition of some importance, how
far the present practice of attempting to teach
young children oratory, will conduce eventually
to encreafing the number of good public speakers ?
It mult be acknowledged that there are not a great
many able in (trustors in this branch of learning;
and for children to commence upon bad or indif
ferent models, is worse than having none. Na
ture is spoiled under such tuition. An indiscri
minate and injudicious aflignment of the partsto
be performed, which is always the cafe when the
pupils are too young to feel the sentiment, is pro
ductive of the worst conlequences : Grimace and
inhnickry must be substituted ; the child acquires
a disgusting confidence, to the deftrudtion of that
modelty which is the belt medium of true wisdom
to the mind. I have seen children afl'ume a daunt
less front in speaking before a numerous audience,
while they were deficient in every article of solid
and ufeful improvement. I have known others ca
relled and applauded at seven or eight years of
age, who when they became men, entirely disap
pointed every plealing anticipation that their pa
rents had formed. The reason is obvious, Chil
dren have memories which receive, and retain
fiÂ»r a time, the llighteft imprefliotisâthey are as
imitative as monkeys: Injudicious applaulb poi foils
their imaginations and inflates their vanity.
Tliefe combined causes allure them into the
love of a praCticefrom which they derive the
grateful incense of praise, to the liegleft of more
important objects. Their improvement in speak
ing, not being founded in principle, and fenti
rtient, turns out in the end, worse than nothing ;
for it appears that their time has been facrificed
in pursuit of a tifelefi acquilition.
However desirable a manly confidence in chil
dren may be, it is much to be feared that when
inspired at too early a period, it lays the founda
tion of conceit, arrogance and ignorance. And
if it were other wife, experience deirtonftrates
that an infeniible, unfeeling orator never
pleases. Perhaps no univerfol rule can be de
termined on. Observation and experience will
afford the belt guide. In general it may be ob
served, that the memories of children often be
come the repository of many things, before they
begin to reason, or accurately compare ideas; that
as this faculty is thus ealily susceptible of im
prcfiious, their senses are equally affected by ex
ternal objects, so as to induce an irrefutable imi
tation of every species of adtion that comes in
contact with them. Hence we are apt to be de
ceived, by mistaking tliefe appearances for real
improvements. The molt that can be derived
from tliefe sources, before realon begins to
alliime its Iway, si to form, and fix certain rules
in the memory, and to give those rules a lading
influence, by the force of habit. When the judg
ment begins to ripen, tliefe rules may be applied ;
and then, but not before, the business of public
declamation may be commenced. Itis generally
found that lads make but indifferent progress in
tliofe parts of education whici require much re
flection, before they are eleven or twelve year s
old. Perhaps this will apply with as great iorce
to the fubjetft under consideration, as to any what
ever. It is of much greater importance to teach
children to read well, than to teach them to de
claim early.â The former is an introduction to
the latter, and depends merely 011 rules ; the el
fentials of the latter are abftra<ft in their nature,
and entirely above the comprehension of children.

To happier themes, the rUral Muse invites,
To calmcft pleasures, and serene delights ;
To us, glad fancy, biighteft profpeÂ£ls (hows,

Here late the Savage hW in ambu(h lay,
Or roam'd the uncultur'd vallies lor his prey ;

No cultur'd fields exgos'd the opening glade ;

With jby repays the lab'ror for l his toils.
Hct hardy gifts, rough industry extends,
The groves bow down, the lofty sorest bends ;

And loads of Commerce swell the 44 downward tide,'*

B 10G RAP HICAL.
DIED in Petty France, London, aged 80, John
Cleland, Esq. He was the foil of Col. C. that cele
brated fuftitious member of the Spe<slator's Club,
whom Steele describes under the name of Will
Honeycomb. A portrait of him hung up in the
foil's library till his death, which indicates all
the manners and d' abord of the fafhionable town
rake in the beginning of this century. The son,
with the scatterings of the father's fortune, and
some share of his diflipations, after parting through
the forms of a good education in Westminster
College, where he was admitted in 1 7Z2, at the
age of 13, and was contemporary with Lord Mans
field, went as Consul to Smyrna, where perhaps,
he firft imbibed tliofe loose principles which, in
a subsequent publication, too infamous to be par
ticularized, tarnifliedhis reputation as an author.
On his return from Smyrna he went to the East
Indies ; but quarrelling with some of the Mem
bers of the Presidency of Bombay he made a pre
cipitate retreat from the East, with little or no
benefit to his fortune. Being without profeffion,
or any fettled means of fubfiftance, he soon fell
into difficulty ; a prison, and its miseries, were
the consequences. In this situation one of tliofe
booksellers who disgrace the profeffion offered
him a temporary relief for writing the work above
alluded to, * which brought a stigma on his name
which time has not obliterated, and which will
be consigned to his memory whilst its poisonous
contents are 111 circulation. For this publication
he was called before the Privy Council, and the
circumftancesof his distress being known, as well
as his being a man of some parts, Jolin Ear]
Granville, the then President, nobly ref'cued him
from the like temptation, by getting him a pen
flon of tool, per year, which he enjoyed to his
death, and which had so much the dcfired t.Tedt
that,that except " TlieMemoirs ofaCoxcomb"
which has lomefmack of diflipated manners and
" The Man of Honor," written as an amende htm
orable for his former exceptionable book, Mr. C
mostly dedicated his time to political and philo
logical publications, and was the author of the
long letters given in the public prints, from time
to time, signed A Briton, Modejlus, &c.&c. and of
some curious tra<fts on the Celtic language. He
lived within the income of his pension for many
years, in a retired lituation in Petty France, sur
rounded by a good library, and the occasional
visits of some literary friends, to whom he was a
very agreeable companion,and died at the advanc
ed age of 80. In converlation he was very plea
sant and anecdotical, underltanding 1110 ft of the
living languages, and speaking them all very
fluently. As a writer, he shewed himfelf best in
novels, long-writing, and the lighter species of
authorship ; but when he touched politicks he
touched it like a torpedo, he was cold, benumb
ing, and foporifick.
