THE TABLE T.âNo. L.
Â« There is a propensity in mankind to refifl as well
is to enforce dominion."
PERHAPS there is riot more nicety in any
question, than -whether men are more a
verse to obey than to be obeyed Few dispositions
are naturally prone to give obedience, and pro
bably as few are willing to relinguifh it. From
this original fountain have flowed perpetual
llreams of oppreflion 011 the one hand and sedi
tion on the other. The secret of curbing the ex
cefl'es ofthefe propensities is found to conlilt in a
well-balanced, well-administered government,
and it admits of no other remedy. Reason, re
ligion, benevolence, good humour, patriotism
and every other ufeful attribute, that can be na
med are utterly inadequate to the purpose of re
straining the turbulent spirit of man from enor
mities.
As the propensity I am fpeakingof is a natural
one itdifcovers itfelf moll strongly among men
least removed from a state of nature. A lavage
has more of it than can be found in any poflible
itage of civilization. Tho the objects, about
which his will is exercised, are few and limited,
vet wherever he fixes a purpose he disdains re
iiftance. This love of rule and hatred of oppo
sition likewise break out, with far greater fury,
among the lowest and vilell part of the communi
ty, than among the sensible and enlightened.
The cruelty of a waggoner over his liorfes is in
comparably greater, than any acfts of severity
that are ever exercised by a man, who moves in
a higher sphere of life. Overseers of negroes
and other laborers discover a temper more domi
neering and wrathful, than can often find a
place in the breasts of tliofe whole employment
is lei's servile.
When a monarch or other elevated characters
discover an arbitrary, opprelfive difpolition, they
excite the attention and complaints of the world.
The infamy of their conduit is perpetuated and
mankind are warned against such evils. But
there are many persons wliofe whole life is a scene
of cruelty and revenge, and yet whole enormi
ties pals unpunished or unregarded. The fa&is,
â  man is too ferocious a being to be let loose. In
many refpedis the law reflrains him. There are
however a thouland instances which the law can
not reach, where men exhibit flriking demon
strations that one of the moll natural features of
the human character, is the love of enforcing as
well as refilling dominion. The propensity to
do both is so active and llrong, that no compari
foncan be drawn to fettle the quellion, which is
the moll universal and irrefillable. From tliefe
Iketches we deduce the necellity of checking the
extremes to which the different lituationsof men
are liable. Men in power mult be rellrained,
and so mull men out of power. One will other
wise be licentious and outrageous, the other op
prelfive and tyrannical. Tliefe hasty remarks
are introductory to a more copious difcullion oi
the fubjeift, which may probably be brought for
ward in foine future speculation.

congratulate you upon your appointment to the
chiefniagiftracy of the Union, by the unanimous
fuffrage of more than three millions of free citi
tens ; an appointment rendered the more digni

more pleasing to your fellow-citizens from a con-
T 'ftion that they could nowhere place the sacred
deposit, for which they have so long and ardu
ouily contended, with equal fafety to themselves,
and honor to their country. We cannot help ex

the mistaken zeal which has lately prevailed in
this State, will give way to a more enlightened

for your health and happinefe. Long, long may
the United States be blefled with a life to which
they are so highly indebted, and may the close of

To the President and Members of the Rhodc-l/land
State Society of the Cincinnati.
GENTLEMEN,
IN returning my grateful thanks for the flat
tering and affetftionute sentiments exprefled in
your address of the 3d instant, I beg you will do
justice to the fincericy of my regard, which reci
procates, with great pleasure, the warmed wishes
for your happiness, political and personal.
Under a persuasion of the candor and support
of my fellow-citizens, I yielded obedience to the
voice of my countryâand imprefled with a sense
of duty, I forfook the pleasures of domestic retire
ment, to promote (if my best exertions can have
such tendency) the object of a dearer interestâ
Those expectations of support have been amply
fulfilled, and fnv fondeft hope of their candor
has been gratified by a kind and partial country.
I am much pleased, Gentlemen, with the hope,
which you entertain, that mistaken zeal will give
way to enlightened policyâand I desire to repeat
to your society, alliirances of the most affectionate
esteem. GEORGE WASHINGTON.

MARIA ANTONIETTA of Austria, QUEEN
of FRANCE,
TO THE NATION.
MY heart was yet bleeding at the loss of a
Prince to whom I had given birth, when it was
allailed by sorrows of a much more diltreffing
nature. All France was in tears, groaning under
the weight of oppression : The horrors of an ap
proaching famine had nearly reduced the people
to despair, and I hear my name mentioned "with
murmuring and impatienceâSuddenly I was in
formed that all Paris was in arms, and that fire
and sword were desolating the capitalâln a mo
ment I saw my court disperse and fly far awaj
from me. My royal consort hallened immedi
ately to his good city, carrying thither at leafl: thai
internal peace which the purity of his principles
has always made him to enjoy, and which thÂ«
consciousness of his love for his people made him
certain of imparting to themâbut nothing could
quiet my tender feelings, alarmed for the citizens
of Paris and for all France, whose universal de
solation filled my heart with unutterable distress.
Thus forfaken and reduccd to the most de
plorable situation, I shut myfelf up with my chil
drenâl prefled them a tlioufand and a thousand
times to my bosomâl mixed my tears and bittei
cries with their infant waitings ; in their tender
and innocent carelles I could find some alleviation
to my %wn misfortunes, but those of the nation
left me inconsolable.
A Princess, whom Heaven has formed and be
llowed on mortajs for the liappinefs of all those
to whom her cares may extend, and for the fa
tisfa(ftion of all who know her, the mast tender
and affectionate of women, came and mixed liei
tears with mine.âYeFrenchmen! Ihe is my cou
lin âthe Duchess of Orleans, (with the live
liest gratitude I mention her name, the found oi
which is as grateful to your ears as her amiable
person is dear to your fouls). The Duchess of
Orleans opened her heart to me.âWhat an inex
haustible source of riches and consolation was
there ! O what a powerful support against mis
fortunes, a woman, nay, even a reigning Princess
may find in a virtuous friend ! May this holy
truth be forever deeply engraved in the heart of
every mortal woman who is deltined to fit upon
a throne. âIt will teach her how difficult it is,from
that exalted feat, to make a proper choice of
friends ; it will lay open to her the falfehood
antl treachery of courtiers, andpreferve her from
the dangerous poison which infects every court.
As fincereas she is tender, endued with courage
equal to her sweetness and gencrofity, this true
friend, in the effufion of her foul, could not dis
semble from me that, I was loudly accused by the
nation to be the author of its calamities.âHow
lively and moving were her expressions ! âWhat
a language they fpokc to my heart ! âlt was op
prefled. âIt was torn with grief.âNothing less
than the affectionate and unwearied cries of that
Princess, could have made me bear so rude a ihock
without expiring with grief.
[. (jti Wednesday and Saturday
O ye, whose wife discernment has never fuffer
ed yon to remain long under any error ! Ye just
and enlightened nation ! YcFrehch men ! whose
name alone is the elogium of your minds ! Ye
people, cherished by the Princess who enjoys the
inei'timable advantage of reigning over you, and
who now addreflesyou with a confidence that is
due to you on 'so many accounts ! Ye models of
love for your Sovereigns as well as for your
country! Ye heroes ! whose great and valiant
fouls have made you so often fhedyour blood for
those Sovereigns as well as for that country !Can
it then be poifible that you have not known âthat
you have forgot your Dauphinefs, who pofl'efies
all your tenderness, and who ever since has so
sincerely loved you ? Ever since the alliance which
has united her to the Prince who has afterwards
become your King until this melancholy seta,
when her misfortune compels her to juftifyher
felf, she never ceased to cherish youâ(he had a -
dopted you from inclination, as Ihe had your Au
guit Dauphin. Yes, ye Frenchmen, in allying
myfelf to you, I had placed all my felicity as well
as all my glory in one day sharing his throne and
reigningover your hearts. Inthe teftinionies of
love which I received from you with so much fa
tisfacftion, and the remembrance, of which will
ever be infinitely deartoine, be lure that you ex
prefled no more than a just gratitude. Ever since
the crown has been placed on the head of my
Royal Consort, my heart never ceased to be filled
with those sentiments ; they are invariable as
their nature âas their principle :â1 will preserve
and cheriih them until the Divinity is pleased to
call me to his bosom ; here let me renew the solemn
promise, to which I swear by the sacred and pre
cious title of Queen of Ffance.
But I will confirm to you with my own mouth,
this promise so pleaftng to my heartâl will go
into the bosom of the capital, and there expand
my foul into that of the nation : I will let them
fee all my grief; and 1 sincerely wish that fame
nation may bring back serenity and joy. My
principal with is to persuade the people, that it
will be the important business of my whole life,
to promote their felicity with all my power. Ah!
may I one day make them forget, that, deceitful
courtiers ; ministers without honor and without
faith ; public plunderers of all kinds, infhort, an
odious, cruel and bloody junto had prepared
their ruin ! Oh ! How happy I lhali then esteem
myfelf ! But I shall never eejoy either tranquility
or fatisfaiftion, until the moment when I shall
have carried into the minds of that most amiable
and most loving nation, that degree of convicftion,
which will restore and ensure to me for ever the
hearts of all my dear Frenchmen.
Let us diflipate our alarms and our fears ; let
us strengthen, by frefh mutual afliirances of re
ciprocal tenderness, the bands that unite us to
each other ; let us render them indifloluble ;
let all the unfortunate apply tome with unbound
ed confidence !âthey will find my heart ever open :
I will pour into theirs, every consolation which
beloved children have a right to expecft from a
tender and affectionate mother whom they love :
I will be eager to give them all the afliftance in
my power ; âI will be their patroness and their
support ; âI will love to weep and grieve with
those that grieve and weep; I will find an infinite
sweetness in wiping off their tears, and I will place
my happiness in drying up the source of them.
Placed on the throne of France, my ainbition.ftill
prompts another fond wish, which will fully fatif
fy my heart : it is, that all Frenchmen maycon
fider me as their best friend.
A wife and economical minister is restored to
us: the restorer of affairs is coming ; perhaps
he hears me at this moment: our misfortunes are
then going to vanish : we may rely on his zeal
and care, as well as on the love of our King for
his people.
EUROPEAN ACCOUNTS, BY THE LAST ARRIVALS.
VIENNA, JULY 8.
An Austrian officer, who arrived here the 3d
instant. in quality of a cotirier from Semlin,
brings the important news that the Ruffian fleet,
under Admiral Wainowich, had attacked and
completely defeated the firft division of the
Turkifhfleet, near Beflarabia. The division had
under its convoy some transports with provisions
for the Grand Vizier's army, which are captur
ed by the Ruffians. After destroying and dif
perling the Turkilh Ihips, the conquerors made
a descent npon the coast, and reduced Kalat and
Ketftaga to ashes by lire.âThis vidlory is the
more important, as. it will tend tooccaficn afcar
city of provisions in the Ottoman army.
News of the above event has caused great con
fternatiou in Cpnftantinople, where the guards
are doubled, and cannon drawn upon the banks
of the Canal to rtfiii the approach of the Ruffians.Ihe ship Alexander belonging to the Turks,
'which was destined to burn the Ruffian fleet, and
which failed for Oftend, laden with merchandize,
foundered on the 7th of lalt month, on the north
coast of Holland, and all the cargo was loft, but
the crew were saved by a fi/hing vefl'el.
PARIS, JULY 9.
The National Aflembly has at length resolved
that the Island of St. Domingo ihall fend fix de
puties to Parliament.
LONDON, JULY I/.
Previous to M. Neckar's dismission, M. de Mira
beau retraced his charge of impeachment against
him, as being the principal cause of the present
scarcity of corn. It feeins that M. de Mirabeau
had been informed that the States of America had
offered to supply France with grain, which was
contraditfted by a letter written from Mr. Jeffer
fon, the American minister at Paris. Hewas im
pofedon, it is said, by some invidious persons to
ruin the character of M. Neckar ; this retracTtion
is, however, no apology for his rashness in al
ledging a grievous charge on such a flight founda
tion;
July 18. By the Custom House books it ap
pears, that the duty on tobacco, from the 4th of
April, 1788, to the sth of April, 1 789, amounted
to four hundred and ninety-eight thousand and
twenty-one pounds, seven /hillings, and two pence
halfpenny, and that the tea for the fame time
only produced one hundred and twelve thousand
and one hundred five pounds, one /hilling, and
two pence. What a fund America fufplies !
July 23. During the tumults in Paris, M.
Labut, a private gentleman, gave 500,000 livres
to aflift the patriots, and at ihc fame time offered
his five children as volunteers in the cause.
The Marquis de la Fayette ordered the Baftik
to be entirely demolijhed without consulting the
King. Amotion was made in the Town hall, to
erect on the spot where the Baftile flood, a Statue,
to be dedicated to Louis XVlâinferibed to the
Father of his people, and the Refiorer of Liberty !
A GENEROUS PROPOSAL!
Were England in the situation France is,
and the blue and buff mob as formidable as the
Parisian Canaille, our East and Weft India pos
sessions would be snatched at by our Gallic neigh
bours. Why then flionld we tamely look on,and
not profit by the wretched state of France ? They
would fliew us no quarter in the fame situation.
JULY 24.
Marshal has written to the Emperor,
to inform him that he expecfted there would be
a practicable breach in the wallsof Berbir by the
27th ult. and it was his intention to storm the;
fort, least, if he should wait to take it by regular
approaches, hefhould lose so much time that the
enemy might be able to fuccourit. The place
is garrisoned chiefly by Bofniacks. The houses
had been almost all beat down by the Marshal's
artillery, when the last letters left the camp be
fore Berbir. The forces employed in this siege
amount to 26,000 men.
ENGAGEMENT between the SWEDES and RUS
SIANS.
On the second of July, a courier arrived at
Stockholm with letters from the King to the
Queen,giving an account that on the 28th of June,
about seven in the morning, his Majesty fell in
with a body of Ruffians, amounting to 3600 men,
near Uddemalm, two Swedifli miles from David
ftadt.
That the left wing, under Lieutenant General
Platen, began to attack the enemy immediately,
and the atftion became general and very hot on
both fides, although the Swedes were but 2100 in
the whole ; but they soon drove the Ruffians,
and took poflion of their camp.
The regiment of Weftermanland fuffered the
most, having one officer killed and twowounded.
Ihe whole loss of the Swedes amounted to 120
killed and wounded. The Ruffians loft twice the
number.
The King of Sweden, who only acted in the
affair as a volunteer, contributed greatly to the
success of the day. After tliefirftfiie, the Swedes
took to their old method of charging with the
bayonet ; and Major Paultman, who, by march
ing roundin the enemy's rear, distinguished hiin
lelf greatly, was made a Lieutenant Colonel on
the field The King ordered the troops to reft
eight hours, and then to proceed to follow the
enemy. His Majesty is going on to Williamftrand,
in order to fee those orders executed, which he
has given forattacking the enemy in every quar
ter, both by land and sea.
Copy of a letter from the King of Sweden to the
Crown Prince.
MY PEAR SON,
I received two letters from you since my leav
ing Stockholm, for which I thank you.
I would not answer them before, because I had
not seen the enemy.
Theirtroops, however, have fought well, but
out s better. This news must excite you to prove
worthy of commanding such a generous and brave
people. lam in health, and always your affec

We have just received an account thai anothei
action has taken place becwen the Ruffians anc
the Swedes in Finland, in which the latter were
defeated.
General Michelfon, notwitliftanding the check
he received frow Col. Steding, who forced him to
retreat to Christina, having been reinforced from
Williamftranit,. renewed his attack of Fort St.
Michael.
Col. Steding was obliged to fall back to a place
at some distance, where General Siegroth lay
with a body of 4000 of the Swedi/h army.
The Ruffians followed, and a battle ensued.
General Siegroth, after a 1110 ft vigorous resist
ance, was obliged to give way, with the loss of 600
men killed and 400 wounded.
St. Michael fell into the hands of the Ruffians.
The loss of this fort will be the most lenfibly
felt by the Swedes, as it was the depot of all the
provisions and stores for their army in the pro
vince of Savolox, and which are now in the pos
session of the Ruffians.
The Swedes fought with great intrepidity :
Tho driven from poll: to poit they never fled ; and
when they were at last obliged to give up the con
test, they retreated in very good order.
They repulsed the Ruffians in two different at
tacks ; but the were forced at the third to bend
under the weight of superior numbers.
This action took place on the fixteeutli of last
month.
To compleat the misfortune of the Swedish
anny, thirteen transports laden with provisions.
and stores for the use of that army, have been
loft on the rocks near Norkoping. One of tliefe
veflels had 011 board the medicine chests destined
for the use of all the ihips composing the Royal
Fleet at Carlfcrone.
August j. We have received advice that tho
Selim 111, seemed from the firft day of his reign
to breath nothing but vengeance againll Austria
and Rnffia, and a continuance of war againll
these two powers, this young Prince has very
lately {hewn symptoms of adifpofition to peace.
The cause of those symptoms are not generally
known. Some attribute them to the defeat of the
firft division of the Turkish fleet, which mult ren
der it next to impossible for the Ottomans to re
cover Oczakow.âOthers to the flow butfure pro
gress of the confederates.
Extract of a letter from Elfncur, Jul}' 25.
"We have received certain advice that the
Peterfburgh fleet of men of war, 40 in number,
were off Gothland, in the Baltic,the 20th current,
and that the Swedish squadron was at the fame
time eastward of Bornholm."
August 6. The flame of liberty is appearing
in Spain ; and we should have wondered if it
had not ;it is too active in itfelf to be longer
dormant, and the example of the firft branch of
the House of Burbon will be too powerful not
to be followed. Many of the Municipalities have
made application to the Governors of the respec
tive provinces to establish their ancient Cortez or
Aflemblies. It may require years before the spi
rit becomes so general as to bring the people ( into
action ; but the {'park is kindled and the Court
has taken the alarm. We have even heard that
the King apprehends the old oath, binding him
to aflemble the Cortez may be tendered to him
at his coronation, and that ceremony has been de
layed from this apprelienfion.
In Flanders the people are much discontented.
The ostensible reason for their murmurs and
diflatisfa<tion is the deprivation of their Tergref
fes (fairs) by the Emperor's orders; but a ipirit
of liberty has for some time been in embryo in
these provinces, and thefituation of France, and
the Emperor's declining state of health, pro
mifethe Flemifliari opportunity of aggrandizing
themselves too glaring to be over looked, and too
precious to be neglected.
August 7. By accounts received in town yes
terday, we learn, that M. de Mefinay, who blew
upfo many of his neighbours at Vefoul, is taken,
and certainly in the hands of justice.
The National Aflembly have proceeded a con
siderable way in the modeling of their constitu
tion, and we rejoice to hear from the best inform
ed men in this kingdom, that their wisdom and
intelligence on this fubje<ftare estimated as high

which brought their Monarch to submission.

September 24. A brilliant action Was perform
ed yelterday 011 board the Leopard, of 74 guns,
belonging to the French fleet, now in this har
bour: A cabin boy, belonging to the ship, un
fortunately fell into the water, and was in the
utmolt danger of being drowned ; the First-Lieu
tenant, Mr. Scotts, happened at that moment,
to be walking the quarter-deck, when he was
informed of the accidentâthe calamity was ur
gent âand he accordingly, without waiting to
undress, instantly plunged into the sea, at the
distance of at leall 25 feet from the furface of the
water, and happily, at the hazard of his own
life, preserved that of the boy, who, in all pro
bability would have otherwise perished. This
event does the highest honor to the courage and
sensibility of the gentleman, who is intitled to the
thanks of every friend of humanity, for this man

The present year is the most remarkable that
the annals of time have produced. No other per
iod of equal extent is marked with such efforts of
the human mind to encreafe and perpetuate hu
man happiness. Look at and compare the situa
tion of the United States now and twelvemonths
past ! How much has been accompliftied, and with
what wlfdom and patriotifin have our affairs pro
grefled! Many a patriot doubted whether the
new government would have so readily afl'umed
an operative appearance. Great were our fears
that prejudice and discord would have infufed
tliemfelves into our early attempts to put our sys
tem in motion. All has terminated well. The
government is organized, and the people are hap
py-
But America is not the only Theatre where
improvements in the science of a happy govern
ment have been displayed. France exhibits a
noble specimen of a people determined to unite
Liberty and Law. This is the great secret, and
this is the peculiar felicity at which every wife na
tion will aim ; and when they arrive at this desira
ble point, glaring is the folly and base the treach
ery of the man, who dares to blow up a flame of
uneasiness and tumult. In this exa<ft point, do
these favored States now reft, and may France, if
her citizens can bear it, reach the fame fuinmir,
and then may we all be quiet and contented.
It appears from the Engliffi papers, that the
flame which burst out in the capital of France,
hasfpread all over the kingdomâThe people ap
pear to be actuated by one ele<ftric spark, which,
while it affecfts the whole body of the citizens, pro
duces the fame uniform exertions to overturn the
too long eftabliflied system of despotismâThe
light that has flaflied upon their minds is in some
instances too powerful to be controled by the di
vine influences of rcafon and humanityâand the
consequences have been shockingâbut the philo
sopher will reason from effeds to their causesâ
and while he regrets the temporary paroxysms of
vengeance, he anticipates a calmer moment, when
reflexion Ihall lull the fervor of zeal, and the
force of vindictive retaliationâwhen in peace,
freedom and happiness, the French nation fliall
enjoy <he bounties of a beneficent Providence, in
one of the fineft countries under Heaven.
In the warmth of debate one day, in the Na
tional Afleinbly, fays an Engliffi paper, the roy
al authority, as exercised hitherto, was treated
with very little ceremony. "HisMajefty," said
one of the Members, " talks to us ofhis intended
bounties to the nation, as if the rights of men were
but the bounties of sovereigns !"
The spark from the Altar ofLiberty in Ame
rica, which has communicated its fire to France,
has not expended its animating fervor. Look to
your Inquisitionsâ to your racksâto your tortures
âand to your religious tyranny, O Spain ! for the
day of your emancipation cannot be far offâthe
right hand of your tyranny is cut off, and Free
dom approaches to place her standard on the walls
of your Inquisition.
It any ottlie human race, individually, or col
lectively confulered, were ever under obligations
to the Governor of the Universe, the people of A
mericaare bound to recognize such obligations.
How suitable then is the duty, Ihortly to be re
commended by our illustrious Chief Magistrate,
of uniting with one heart, and one voice, in.
prayer, praise and tliankfgiving " to the giv
er ofevery good gift !

WEALTH EXAMINED,
(in continuation.)
FLORENCE too, and Cofinus, are quoted,
and the alternatives of" treachery, revenge, and
cruelty ; all arising, as they did in Greece, from
the want of a proper division of authority and an
equal balance. Let any one read the liiltory of
the lirft Colinio, his wisdom, virtues, and un
bounded Â«opularity, and then conlider what
would have been the consequence if Florence, at
that period, had been governed by our author's
plan of successive single aflemblies, chosen by the
people annually. It is plain that the people
would have chosen such, and such only, for re
presentatives as Cofimo and his friends would
have recommended : at lealt a vast majority of
them would have been his followers, and he
would have been absolute. It was the aristocra
cy and forms of the old constitution that alone
served as a check upon him. The speech of Uz
zano must convince you, that the people were
more ready to make him absolute than ever the
Romans were to make Casfar a perpetual dicta
tor. He confefles that Cofimo was followed by
the whole body of the plebeians, and by one half
the nobles: Thar if Cofimo was not made malter
of the Commonwealth, Rinaldo would be, whom
he dreaded much more. In truth, the govern
mental this time was in reality become monarch
ical, and that ill-digested aristocracy, which
they called a popular State, exiftedonly in form ;
and the persecution of Cofimo only served to ex
plain the secret. Will it be denied that a na
tion has a right to choose a government for them
selves ? The question really was no more than
this, whether Rinaldo or Cofimo ihould be mas
ter. The nation declared for Cofimo, reversed
that banishment into which he had been very un
juftiyfent by Rinaldo, demanded his return, and
voted him the father of his country. This alone
is full proof, that if the people had been the
keepers of their own liberties, in their fuceel
five aflemblies, they would have given them all
to Cofimo ; whereas, had there been an equal
mixture of monarchy, aristocracy, and democra
cy, in that constitution, the nobles and commons
would have united against Cofimo the moment he
attempted to overleap the boundaries of his legal
authority. Uzzano confeffes, that unless charity,
liberality and beneficence, were crimes, Cofimo
was guilty of no offence, and that there was as
much to apprehend from his own party as from
the other, in the point of liberty. All the sub
sequent attempts of Rinaldo to put Cofimo to
death and to banifli him were unqualified tyran
ny. He saved hislife, itistrue, by a bribe, but
what kind of patrons of liberty were those who
would betray it for a bribe ? His recall and re
turn from banifliment feerns to have been the ge
neral voice of the nation, exprcfled, according
to the forms and spirit oftheprefent
without any appearance of such treachery as our
author suggests. Whether Nedham knew the
real history of Florence is very problematical;
all his examples from it are so unfortunate as to
be conclulive against his proje<ftof a government.
The real eflence of the government in Florence
had been, for the greatest part of fifty years, a
monarchy, in the hands of Uzzinoand Nafo, ac
cording to Machiavel's own account; its form
an aristocracy, and its name a popular state : No
thing of the eflence was changed by the reftora
tionof Cofiino ; the form and name only under
went an alteration.âHolftein too is introduced,
merely to make a story for the amusement of a
drunken mob. " Here is a health to the re
" membranceof our liberty." faidthe " boorish,
" poor, filly generation," seventy years after
they were made a duchy. Many hoglheads of
ale and porter, I doubt not, were drank in En
gland in consequence of this Holftein story; and
that was all the effect it had it could have towards
supporting our authpr's argument.
'' How deep soever the imprellion may be, that
" is made by the love of liberty upon the minds
" of the people, it will not follow that they alone
" are the belt keepers of their own liberties, be
" ingmore tender and more concerned in their
" security that any powerful pretenders whatfo
" ever." Are not the lenafors, whether they
be hereditary or elective, under the influence of
powerful motives to be tender and concerned for
the security of liberty ? Every senator, who con
fultsliis reason, knows that his own liberty, and
that of his posterity, must depend Upon the con
stitution which preserves it to others. What
greater refuge can a nation have, than in a coun
cil, in which the national maxims, and the spirit
and genius of the state, are preferred by a living
tradition?' What stronger motive to virtue, and
to the preservation of liberty, can the human mind
perceive, next to those of rewards and punifli
ments in a future life, thnn the recollection of a
long line of ancestors who have fat within the
walls of the senate, and guided the councils, led
the armies, commanded the fleers, and fought the
battles of the people, by which the nation has
been sustained in its infant years, defended from
dangers, and carried through calamities, to
â wealth,grandeur, prosperity, and glory? Whp;
institution more ufeful can possibly exist, than
a living repertory of all the history, know
ledge, interests, Â«nd wisdom of the common
wealth, and a living leprefentative of all the
great characters whose prudence, wisdom, and
valour, are registered 111 the history and record
ed in the archives of the country ? If the peo
ple have the periodical choice of these, we may
hope they will select those, among the moll con
spicuous for fortune, family and wealth, who
are most signalized for virtue and wisdom, which
is more advantageous than to be confined to the
ekleft son, however defective, to the exclusion
of younger sons, however excellent, and to one
family, though decayed and depraved, to ano
ther more deserving as in hereditary senates ;
But thatafenate, guarded from ambition, (hould
be objected to, by a friend of liberty and repub
lican government, is very extraordinary. Let
the people have a full lhare, and a decisive nega
tive ; and, with this impregnable barrier againlt
the ambition of the senate on one fide, and the
executive power with an equal negative 011 the
other, such a council will be found the patron
and guardian of liberty 011 many occasions, when
the giddy thoughtless multitude, and even their
representatives, would negledt, forget, or even
despise and insult it; inflances of all which are
not difficult to find.

NEW-JERSEY PAPER MONEY.
NUMBER I.
To the CITIZENS of the State of NEW-JERSEY.
THE tender on the continental currencyaud
on the State money of the ninth of June, 1780
was very injurious to the citizens ofNew- jersey!
The injustice ofimpofing a tender or a depreciat
ing paper was very apparent from .We two in.
fiances. Yet the State of New-Jersey, after dear
bought experience, and in time of peace, in 1786
emitted a paper-money, commonly called Loan-
Office-Money, to circulate for the term oftwelve
years, and armed it with a tender. The State in
1786, impoled a tender also on another species
of their paper money, commonly called Revenue-
Money, which then had twenty-two years to run.
The paper money of this State, has, from the
year 1786 to theprefent day,depreciated nearly,
if not fully, one-third in its nominal value; and
the depreciation of it, has in many cases 011 com
pulsory payments, occasioned to the creditor the
loss of one-third of his debt. A Paper daily depre
ciating, wearing a tender, injuring at almost
every rtepinits progress, and likely fotoconti-,
nue in one part, until the year 1 798, and in ano
ther part until the year 1808, was a mifchief fe
jious in its nature and fraught with many preju
dicial consequences too obvious to need an enu
meration. This was an enormous evil, which
called loudly for redress. To remedy this and
other evils, was framed the Constitution of the
United States of America, which the State of
New-Jersey unanimously ratified. This Consti
tution on the fourth of March, 1789, on which
day it began to proceed and to diffufe extensively
its beneficial effects, did, by the tenth fedion of
the firft article, and by the second clause of the
sixth article, fupercede and do away between ci
tizen and citizen in the payment of debts, the
tender on the loan-officemoney and revenue mo
ney of New-Jersey. This is aiiiong many others,
one great benefit, which this State has already
derived from the new Constitution. Happy /Era,
when was baniihed fronuhe Union, the folly and
iniquity of a tender on worthless Paper ! The
only money, which since the fourth of March
last, lias carried in New-Jersey a legal tender in
the payment of debts between citizen and citizen,
is' Spanifii milled silver dollars and Portugaljohan
nefes, which were legitimated by ast ofthe legilla
ture of that State on the eleventh of February,
1777- The loan-office money and revenue mo
ney, are lawfully receivable in the payment of
taxes to the State, in the fame manner they
were before the fourth of last March. Theloan
office money is,and by law ought to be receivable
by the State until the expiration of its term, in
fatisfadlion and discharge of the mortgages, on
which the bills were loaned, in the fame manner
it was before the fourth of last March. The
New-Jersey paper money has not had, since the
fourth of March last, any legal tender on it be
tween citizen and citizen in compulsory payment#
of debts. The citizens of New-Jersey are well
entitled to avail themselves in their contracts and
other money matters of the benefit of the new
Constitution, the fupremelaw of the State.
