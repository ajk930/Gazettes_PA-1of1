MEN who pass their lives in contempla
tion and retirement seldom acquire
fuchideas of human nature as are proper to be
carried into practice. The melancholy impres
sions that are excited by a reelule, l'edentary life
have a molt pernicious eH'etit on the government
of a family- Most people make their own feel
inn-s the itandard by which to try the actions and
opinions of others. Tliispropenfity leads to pe
culiar inconveniences, when applied by old peo
ple to the management of youth. It is to be re
acted that systems of education are formed by
such men, and imposed on the world as the wifelt
and belt.
The natural love of company and strong de
sire for society, which seem to characterize so
areat a proportion of the human race, can never
beextinguifhed. They mull and will have scope,
and whoever attempts to destroy them, is waging
waragainftreafon and nature. His plan will ine
vitably be defeated, and he will reap anguish and
disappointment by his miltake, while his children
blait his fond hopes and fair prospeCts by their
profligacy and disobedience. The passions of a
,outh cannot be eradicated ; and if by forced
rales of education they are for a while fupprefl
ed, the barriers will foouer or later be broken
down, and they will rush forth like an irrefutable
torrent that carries every thing before it. No
thing however is more practicable than to pre
vent such difalters.
When a child discovers strong marks of vivaci
ty and it is difficult to curb his propensities, his
temper should not be soured, or his spirit cramp
ed by restraints. He may be so managed that his
fportsand recreations will turn into fafe chan
nels, and not run to pernicious extremes. Does
hemanifeila lively inclination for company;
let him be indulged in his favorite wiih. The
best method to prevent his having bad aflociates,
ij to cultivate a spirit of ambition, -that shall re
gulate the choice of his companions. His humour
mould be watched, treated with delicacy and
tenderness, and in that way controuled ; but it
can never be subdued. By a fkilful appeal to his
pride and vanity, they will constitute a security
againftthefeduCtions of low and abandoned cha
racters. There is no natural preference in chil
dren for vicious company or amusements. They
are firft allured into bad practices by finding ea
sy access, and feeling little rellraint by the fami
liar manners and sportive pleasantry of merry
fervauts and wicked wags. Such society gives
relief to the young mind from the rigorous pre
cepts, and Hern gravity which too often and too
fatally characterize parental government. A ve
hement love of society is not incoinpatable with
the nicelt choice of company, if pains were sea
sonably taken to instil an aversion against worth
less or scandalous aflociates. Most children may
he prevailed upon to have their diversions and
companions designated ; but it is as much an aCt
of folly to opv)ofe their inclinations, as it is of
imprudence not to observe and regulate them.
Decency and good morals maybe rendered plea
rant aswell as ufeful and commendable. Youth
nay be taught to distinguish between actions that
are proper and improper, without thwarting their
prevailing disposition. Under reasonable indul
gence and with a little precaution they may be
guarded agaift ngrofs vices and such practices us
ire openly scandalous.

to this is she indebted for her unparalleled ad
vances to greatness and empire, and on this does
the preservation of her future liberties and all
the invaluable rights of human nature eflential
ly depend.âWhat more noble or engagingcon
fiderations can be urged to prove the propriety
and policy of our exertions to place on the molt
liberal and solid grounds, the education of the
present generation ?âLet schools and colleges be
every where reared, as the more pleasing substi
tutes of jails andhoufes of correction, that a pro
per bias may be given to the tender mind, and
youth trained up in the way they fliould in future
walk : There is a native ingenuity in the cfifpo
fiiion of mankind, which by early cultivation may
be brought to maturity, and society thereby re
lieved in a great degree from the evils resulting
from ignorance and obstinacyâits natural off
fpring ; and each individual, inllead of being im
pelled by the fear of punifhment,be drawn by acon
fcioufnefs of duty to aCt well his part. Constitutions
and forms of government will little avail, without
a general prevalence of religionâthe cultivation
of private virtue and a refinement of the moral
sense from her local situation, poflef
fes greater advantages for ths promotion of lite
rature and the arts, than has marked many other
nations in the early of their political ex
istenceânot being subjeCt to the constant inroads
of barbarians or the tyranny of superstition, nor
interrupted by the frequent din of arms ever
lioltile to the arts âhere peace waves her gentle
banners, and under the pleafine; auspices of our
present happy form of government and enlight
ened adminiltrators, science shall expand her ge
nial rays and the various fountains of learning
through the continent,annually iflue their streams,
which like the periodical inundations of the Nile
shall enrich the country all around.
While the lefler schools and every literary in
stitution, however final], must be thought wor
thy the attentioji of government âI hope to fee
the eftablilhment of a federal univerfityâitis an
idea which has been heretofore suggested, and
which presages much future advantage to the
publicâSuch a society may in a central
situation of the Union, under the management
of able instruCtors, to whichthe lludents gradua
ting at the different state colleges may repair, to
finifli their education, by remaining two or three
years, and principally directing their ltudies to
the political interelts of their country âthe great
objects of legislation and national jurisprudence.
As we have taken our station among the other
nations of the world, itis highly proper we should
form on national principles, which can be belt done
by promoting such institutions as have a tenden
cy to remove local views and habits, and beget
mutual confidence, esteem and good fellowlhip
between those who are embarked in the fame bot
tom, and mult rife or fall together. The insti
tution above alluded to, I think will be happily
calculated to answer those valuable purposes, and
have the moll beneficial effects in a political view.
In order to avoid the idea, or prevent its being
in fact: an exclusive kind of education, it ought
to be conftruifted 011 the moll economical plan,
that the expence may be no bar to those who may
wifhto participate of the inflruCiion there to be
received, to form themselves for future eminent
Cervices to their country, to which their fludics
ought more particularly to be directed. Contract
ed and envious minds will always view with pain
every exertion made to cultivate and improve the
understanding of others, so as to raise them a
bove the level of their own : But this 1 presume
will be 110 objection of weight to the eltablifh
ment of those feniitiaries of learning and science,
u here men may be well instruCted in the rights
of human nature, and ltreftgtliened in their abi
lities to ail'ert those rights, and preserve them in
violate from that tyranny and oppression under
which mankind have too often groaned in lei's
enlightened ages.
We find by a review of the history of ancient
Rome, wliofe lustre and national greatness was
once the alfonifhment of the world, the arts and
jciences, and liberty, ever flourifhed hand in
hand, while they could boast a set of wife and able
Princes who gave thein all due encouragement â
and that to check the progress of literature, and
to marr every noble exertion of the human pow
ers, formed the firft attempts of their tyrannic
rulers, to enslave thein ; and we observe liberty
and the arts to have gradually decayed, till they
finally funk into their original barbarity and Go
thicifm. It remains for America, by an early at
tention to the encouragement of every art and
science, and the cultivation of the human mind,
to the highest pitch of improvement, to fit the in
habitants of this western world for the enjoy
ment of that freedom and independence for

which they have so nobly foughtâand which will
never be wrested from thein, while they fuck in

them of this mighty boon from heaven.
AMERICANUS.
A Jhort sketch of the HISTORY of SWEDEN.
AS Sweden occupies at present in a high de
gree the attention of the public, we shall fur
nifh our 'readers with a concise narrative of its
history, from the remotest period to the present
time.
The firlt epocha of Sweden extends from the
firlt peopling of the country, whenever that was,
to the time when King Olaus embraced the Chris
tian faith, about the yearÃj3.
This was a period of little importance as nothing
certain can be said concerning it. The Swedes,
unwilling to be outdone by the Danes, have, like
them, been fond of magnifying their antiquity,
but the accounts given us byfonie of their histo
rians are obviously too fabulous to merit attention.
from this period, down to the time when the
three northern crowns were united, under Queen
Margaret of Denmark, in 1307, there are but
few circumstances that deserve our particular no
tice. Sweden was pretty much in the fame state
with Denmark, being partly involved in intestine
troubles, and partly engaged in contests with its
neighbors.
Though by the Constitution of Calmar, it was
agreed upon, that Denmark, Sweden and Nor
way, lliould be governed for the future by the
fame Princes, yet that constitution being more
favorable to the Danes than the Swedes, the latter
were perpetually endeavoring to ihake off the
yoke. Hence they were involved in perpetual
contests and disorders, and were fubje<ftedto great
calamities ; till at length the spirit of the nation
was roused, such noble efforts were made under
the auspicious conduct ofGuftavus Ericfon, about
IJ2B, that the Swedes effectually recovered their
liberties and their independence.
The most important period in the Swedish hi
story is undoubtedly the interval between the
reign ofGuftavus Ericfon and the death of Charles
XII. in tliÂ£ year 1 718. This is a period in which
that kingdom is diftinguiihed by several striking
events at home, and by ihe figure which it made
obroad.
Guftavus Ericfon, besides restoring the free
dom of his country, aboliflied Popery, and esta
blished Lutheranil'm, ruled with great dignity,
and renderedthe crown hereditary in his family.
Guftavas Adolphus was one of the greatest he
rpes of modern'times, and has rendered his name
extremely illustrious by his mighty actions in Ger
many, in defence of the Protestant cause, againlt
the attempts of the House of Austria. The grand
enterprizes begun by Guftavus Adolphus, in fa
vor of Germanic Liberty, civil and religious,were
completed under the minority of his daughter,
Christiana, whose resignation of the sovereignty,
and whose Angular character are curious objects
ot history. Equally lingular is the character of
Charles XII, with regard to whom it is needless
to fay, that his wonderful achievements and ex
traordinary adventures have ranked him among
the most celebrated persons whom the world ever
produced.
The Swedish Kings had been fucceflively grow
ing more and more arbitrary, and Charles XII,
had become so in a higher degree than any of
his predecefiors. But till the revolution in that
kingdom in 1772, it appears that the people had
again reduced the kingly power within very nar
row limits.
This country seems to be gradually advancing
in knowledge, commerce, and the arts of life ;
and though it has not lately made the figure it
formerly did, it has been fuccefsfulin its wars ;
and though one could form no idea that the mo
dern Swedes are the,defcendants of those who un
der Guftavus Adolphus and Charles XII carried
terror in their names, through the most distant
countries, and Ihook the foundations of the
gieateft empires, yet that nation will probably
soon recover some lhare of her former character
under Guftavus 111. the reigning monarch, who,
as is evident both from his late and present con
duct, is a Prince of great ambition, and of very
conftderable abilities.

PARIS, MAY 26.
A strong debate is expected to-morrow 111 the
House of Commons, in cpnfequence of amotion
made this clay by a Monf. Mirabeau, which is, to
hold no more conciliatory conferences with the
other Orders, but to apply themselves directly
to such of the Members of the Clergy and Nobles
as they know are inclined in tavor of the people,
and invite them to join in the Common Aflembly,
in order to enter immediately into the bulinels
which the nation has trusted to them. Should
this step succeed, the diflentients must come in
likewise, or obtain adifl'olution of the States.
For want of more material business, amotion
â¢was made, and a debate ensued, for giving liberty
to the Members to come to the Aflembly in frocks,
boots, &c. unincumbered with their profeflional
dress. The Englilh Houfeof Commons was quo
ted as an example : it palled, however, in the ne
gative-.
Another motion, much more important, was
made, for the dilcontinuing of the plays given by
t'le court to the Deputies of the Aflembly, left they
ihould fall into thedillipation of the court,negledt
their morals, and estrange their thoughts from
the business of the nation. This question had
no better fate than the former.

It having been aflerted in the House of Com

Weft-India islands, for money due to this coun
try to the enormous extent of seventy millions
sterling, it may be curious to observe the value
of some of the Weft India illands little more than
a century ago. In the year 1619, the Court of
France fold Gaudaloupe, Marigalante,the Saints,
and all the property of these islands, for 73,000
livres, equal to 31001. sterling, to Mr. Boifleret.
Mr. Dupacquet paid, a year afterwards, 60,000
livres for the islands of Martinico, St. Lucia,
Grenada, and the Grenadines, equal to 25501. ;
and Malto, in the year 1691, paid 40,000 crowns
for St. Kitt's, St. Martin's, Sr. Bartholomew, Santa
Cruz, and Tortola, equtil to about 51001. The
purchasers were allowed an unlimited authority,
disposing of all places civil and military, and pos
sessing the power of lifeand death overthe veflals.
They were in fad; petty sovereigns. Without enter
ing into the questions now agitated about the (lave,
trade, it maybe fairly doubted, whether, without
that trade, the islands would have been in their
present flourishing condition.

SKETCH OF PROCEEDINGS OF CONGRESS.
In the HOUSE of REPRESENTATIVES of the
UNITED STATES.
SATURDAY, AUG. 8.
THE following meflage was received from
The President yellerday, by the Hon. Gen.
Knoxâviz.
Gentlemen
ok the House or PÂ«.epresentatives,
THE buftnefswhich has hitherto been under the con
sideration if Congress has been offo much importance,
that 1 -was unwilling to draw their attention from it
to any other fubjeft. .But the disputes which exijl be
tween some of the United States and several powerful
tribes of Indians within the limits of the Union, and
the hojtilities which have in feveralinflances been com
mitted on the frontiers, seem to require the immediate
interposition of the general government.
I have therefore directed the several Jlatements and
papers, which have been submitted to me on thisJubjeft
by General Knox, to be laid before you for your infor
mation.
While the measures of government ought to be cal
culated to proteCi its citizens from all injury and vio
lence, a due regard should be extended to those Indian
Tribes, whose happiness, in the course of events, so
materially depends on the national justice and human
ity of the United States.
If it should bf the judgment of Congress, that it
would be moji expedient to terminate all differences in
the southern diflrifl, and to lay the foundation for fu
ture confidence, by an amicable treaty with the Indian
Tribes in that quarter, I think proper to fuggejl the
consideration of the expediency of'inftituting a tempor.
ary cotnmiffion for that purpose, to confifl of three per
sons, whose authority should expire with the occasion.
How far such a measure, unafpjied by pojls, would
be competent to the ejlablijhment and preservation of
peace and tranquility on the frontiers, is also a matter
which merits your serious consideration.
Along with this objetl / am induced to fuggefl ano
ther, with the national importance and necessity of
which lam deeply imprejfed I mean fame uniform
and efftllive fyjiem for the Militia of the United
States. It is unnecejfary to offer arguments in recom
mendation of a measure, on which the honour, fafety,
and well-being of our country so evidently and so es
sentially depend.
But it may not be amifsto observe, that lam parti
cularly anxious it should receive as early attention as
circumjlances "will admit ; because it is now in our pow
er to avail ourselves of the military knowledge dijj'cm
inated throughout the several States, by means of' the
many well injlrutted officers and soldiers of the late
army, a resource which is daily diminishing by deaths
and other caujes.
To fuffer this peculiar advantage to pass away un
improved, would be to negteft an opportunity which
will never again occur, unless, unfortunately, we
/hould again be involved in a long and arduous war.

Mr. Clymer, from the committee appointed
for the purpose, brought in a bill for providing
for the expences of the Indian Treaties, &c-
Adjourned.
TUESDAY, AUGUST 11.
The bill providing for the expences of nego

appointment of commissioners for that purpose,
was read a second time, and refered to a commit
tee of the whole house.
Several petitions were read, and laid on theta
ble.
The house then resolved itfelf into a committee
of the wholeâ(Mr. Boudinot in the cliaii) to
take the above bill into consideration.
The words in the bill " thatCommiflioners not
exceeding three" it was moved should be lt" ic
out. This motion was opposed. It was conten
ed that if the appointment of Comniiffioneis | 3S
left indefinite, and they might be encreafe a
pleasure, the United States may be plunge in
great and heavy expences âThat past expenenc
has shewn, that great frauds and peculations nw,
be jullly apprehended in these negotiations, a
this will leave the business open to like impo
donsâThat it was unconstitutional to vote
except a previous estimate of the ' eivl^ c .lÂ°t,r
performed, was exliibitd. It was further lai
the right of making and judging of treaties v
in the Legislature, and that the motion w ' e " r
divefl the house of a right veiled in it by thec
flitutionâThat the house could not J".
measure to their condiments âand that it
open a door to such encroachments, and e
Inch a precedent as might be attended wiMl
worst consequencesâThat the righto â r eatieit
to judge and influence in the forming 1 r< ;'
is evident from this, " That the powei
ing provision for the expences of carrying
treaties in execution rests in the 'â¢ J en r it was said, from this, " That if ten
r o miiiiffiÂ°ners Ihould be appointed, Hill the houle
may provide for such a number as they may think
support "f the motion-it was saidâthat it is
lirely improper to limit the number of the
comujiiiionersâthat the conftitiition has expreif
lv veiled the power of forming treaties in the ex
/cutiveâthat in fact the Houle has nothing fur
ther to do in the business, than to provide the
necelfary fupplies-tliat if we are to be deterred
from adopting the motion by the tear of abules,
the fame principle may prevent the decilion of the
House upon almost any question that comes be
fore themâbut there are more serious abuses to
be apprehended from negledt and delay in this
b u f m efs, than from the supposed fraudulency of
those who may be appointed commissioners.â
war will open a wider door to frauds and pecu
lations âand is not (it was asked) the Iheddingof
blood a greater evil ? Is not the lacerating our de
fencelefs citizens afi abuse of a much more alarm -
in<r consequence ? It was further observed, that
we have every reason tofuppofe, that such per
sons will be appointed, as have a character to
form or fupport âA magnanimous policy it is ex
pected, will be adopted by the new governmenjâ
such a policy as will inspire a veneration and con
fidence inthe minds of the Indian tribesâand if,
agreeable to this idea,ai-efpeiitablecommiflion is
appointed in due season, much expence in future,
anil a cruel war may be prevented.âlt was said,
that the constitution has afligned to the several
puts of administration, its refpecflive powers.â
The power of forming treaties is not in the Houle ;
and if they usurp this power, they may upon the
ftme principle afliime all the powers of thecon
ftitution âIf we restrain the President as
to the number of coinmiflioners, it may be necef
farv for him to exceed the limitation, and it would
in that cafe, certainly be his duty to do itâwhich
would render the reftrktion nugatory.
Many more ingenious observations were offer
ed on both fides of the queltionâwhen the vote
being taken, the motion for striking out the
words, palled in the affirmative by a large ma
jority.
A motion was then made, that the committee
ihciildrife, and report the billâupon which
Mr. Jackson role,and said, That he conceived
it to be his indispensable duty to give the house
fomeinformation refpecfting the deplorable fixa
tion ofthe defencelefs, plundered, and wretched
Inhabitants of the State of Georgia. Whatever
Congress may do refpecfting the fending Commis
sioners to treat with the Creek Indians, except
they at the lame time are given to imderftand,
and made to believe, that if they will not tieat,
the arm of power will be extended to teach them
justice, the appointment of be
ofno avail : We have lately sent coinmiiTioners,
who were treated with contempt âand since that
time, the people have been plundered,their houl
es destroyed, and numbers of them butchered,
no age or sex has been spared. Mere paper ne
gociations they are taught to delpife : Congress
alone can strike them with awe : I o Congrels
the people look lor redressâand il they are not
succoured and relieved by the Union, they must
seek protect ion elsewhere : In full confidence or
this support and protection they were led to the
unanimous adoption of the New Conftitutiou â
And lhall their hopes and exoectations be defeat
ed ? I trust not. Their chief has his einiflaries in S.
and North-Carolina, and in Georgiaâand the
determination of this Legillature will be soon
known to him. It is in vain to think of giving
security to the citizens of Georgia, or bringing
these Indians to treat, without inspiring a tull
apprelienfion that a fufficierit force will be railed
to convince them of the power of the United
States to bring them to terms. Mr. Jack/on ad
ded several other observations, and concluded by
reading a clause, which he moved fliould be
added to billâproviding for the railing a luf
ficient military force, for the protection of the ill
habitants of the State of Georgia, in cafe the
Creeks refufe to enter into a treaty.
This motion was seconded, but after some de
bate it was withdrawn.
The committee then rose, and the Chairman
reported the bill, with the amendments, to which
the house acceded, and voted that the bill be en
grolled for a third reading to morrow.
The meflage received from the President ve(-
terday, was read, and refered to a committee of
the whole house 011 the state of the Union. Mr.
Jackfoii then brought forward his clause in the
form of a resolution, which was refered to the
lame committee.
Mr. Wads worth, of the joint committee ap
pointed to consider and report when it will be
convenient for Congress to adjourn âalso to re
port what business, now before Congress, must be
neceflarily attended to previous to a recess, bro't
in a report to this effect :âThat it will be pro
per and convenient for Congress to adjourn on
the twelfth of September nextâand that poftpon
â ng other business, till the next feliion, it will be
neceflary to attend to the following, previous to
t-ie adjournment, viz.

NEWTORK, AUGUST 12.
FROM CORRESPONDENTS.
Tlie oppofers of honorary didintdions for our
federal rulers refer to the Condicution with the
greated proprietyâfor that is totally silent upon
tliefubjetd: The word President cannot be con
sidered as a Title, any more than that of Gover
nor : It is therefore evident that no titles were
ever intended to be given by the framers of the
Constitution.
I r seems to have been forgotten by some per
sons, in contemplating the pay of the Federal Le
gillators, that every citizen of the United States,
of 35 or 30years of age, is eligible to a feat in that
legislatureâand that consequently the compen
sation proposed, is not the grant ot money to any
particular man, or body of men exclusivelyâbut
is an allowance held up to the view of every Son
of Columbia, as aftimulusto excite a mod lauda
ble ambition, to qualify liimfelf to serve his coun
try as a Legislator. However benevolent and pa
triotic their motives are* who are opposed to this
compensation, it may eventually appear, that they
are not advocating the cause of an independent
Legislature, which shall be composed not only of
the a (fluent, but of characters in medium and
inferior circumstances âfor genius and patriotifin
are confined to no rank or condition ot life.
Every class of citizens has its rights to support
and defend âthe pay therefore of our delegates,
ought to be at such a rate, as to encourage and
enable such competent characters, let their cir
cumdances in life be ever so humble, to quit their
particular profellions for a season, as will enter
into the feelings of their constituents, more inti
mately than those in more elevated situations.
Who will probably be raoft benefited by the
independency of the Legislature, especially of
the deinocratical branch ? Surely the body of the
people at large. Whether the propoled allow
ance is extended beyond the limits neceilary to
obtain this important objedt, is hardly a matter
ot opinion: A refpeftable majority of the House
of lleprefentatives, that branch which mud be
supposed to have the tendered feelings for the
people, and which has exhibited unequivocal
proofs of its attachment to their cleared rights,
has declared that it does not.
A correspondent asks, how it came to pass that
the President of the old Congrels was diled Ex_
cellency, when there is a clause in the Confede
ration which forbids all titles of nobility ?âHe
can account for it 011 no other principle than this,
that " Excellency" was not then a title of that im
port.
The idea of didindtions among the fame spe
cies ofbeings is odious âwe allhadthefame oiigin,
and " dull thou art" is written upon all the chil
dren of mortality.â
Bled be the golden age, pure, and refin'd,
When one low level, level'd all mankind. /
NOTE TO CORRESPONDENTS.
Q5" " Tom Te l lt ruth's humorous letter is received âbut
we must be.excused from publifhirig itâthe fubjea it alludes to
(compensations) has already excited apprehensions, and some de.
gree of uneasiness : Personalities we are determined to avoidâ
and as Congress appear as tenacious of the rights of the people,
as they are solicitous to support the independence of the Federal
Legillature, there can be no doubt that their decisions will even
tually fatisfy their condiments.
OF TITLES, PRO AND CON.
A late writer in the Maflachufetts Centinel 6b-
Jerves, as follow, viz. As for the article about
" titles of nobility," it is too absurd to merit a
minute's attention. The fume article was in the
Confederation ; but was never even supposed to
assetS: titles given to Constitutional officers, he
fides, the title of " His Majefiy" would not bo a
" title of nobility,"but a tide of sovereigntyâA
title which the person whareprefcntsthe " MA
JESTY OF THE PEOPLE" of the United States,
well defcrvesâand which he'will ere long receive.
The Supreme Executive will then be considered
in Europe, as on a par with their Sovereignsâ
and that efficiency be found in the head of our
Empire, which the voice of the whole continent
has been so long and so loudly calling for.
THE PROGRESS.
Honorary Titles lead to permanent dijlinftions and
hereditary eft ablijhments, these to mor.ftrous taxes,
and both to the ruin of liberty : For nothing is
more certain, than that the pay must be railed in
proportion to the imaginary consequence of the
officers, to which it is appropriated. If we mean
to be free let us begin early, and not fufFer any
innovations, which like the ignis fatuus of the e
venine, may lead we know not where.

Ext raft of a letter from Bristol, May 22.
" A bill is brought into Parliament to regulate
the corn and flour import and export trade, and
which is expected to pass into a law, and by it great
difficulties are expecfted to attend the importation
of these articles, of which I deem it right to ad
vise you, left by the account I gave, you should
be induced to export, and be alofer."
ItJhould have been noticed before, in this piper, that in balloting for
their refpeflive claps in the Senate,, Mr. King drew the class jor fix
years, and Mr. Schuyler that for two years.
PORTSMOUTH, AUGUST I.
Ext raft of a letter from a gentleman at Halifax, for
merly a citizen of this Jlate, to his friend in this
town.
" I have read, with Angular pleasure, the de
bates of the NewCongrefs, and in particular those
011 the question, " whether the Secretary of
Foreign Affairs ihall be removed by the President
and inuft condidly confefs that the speeches and
debates thereon, are not to be equalled in any
public aflembly on earth, every exptefiion breathes
sentiments of liberty from the foul ?âHow happy
mult your situation be, under a government for
med by tried patriots, culled from among mil
lions ? A government administered by men, who,
ifwe may "judge from atTtion and speech, express
themselves as "if it were upon their eternal hap
piness ; ruled by a Prelident, whose conduct calls
for a coinparifon from a higher power than earth :
To the citizens of the United States the name of
Washington founds in their ears like the name
of a friend.^âHow happy Ihould I be to live un
der such a government âand how pleasing would
it be to my friend, ii he could fay that I, instead
of flying my country in the hour of difficulty,
now lye numbered with those heroes, who fell to
eltablilh liberty for their polterity ! Heroes who
sleep on earth to live in glory. But the wilh ot
your friend is, that the proceedings of the sons
of America, ma; be a pattern and precedent to
the world, and that Ihe may soar unrivalled in the
liemifphere of glory."
