Â« The fear of punijhment may retrain fame peo
/ from the commtjfion of atrocious crimes ; but it
â¢[tiding too much from that pajfton, to imagine
1 /it is alone capable of guarding youth agai/iji im
furalor imprudent aCiions."
TO determine how far it is proper to lay
prohibitions upon the condudt of chil
dren, conllitutes one of the most difficult parts
f education. Too much severity or too much in
dulgence produce refpeiftivcly a train of very se
rious consequences. It is however much more
eaiy to complain of this difficulty, than to re
move it. There are two important points ofview,
in which the fubjeift shall be considered.
In the firft place, it is requisite to distinguish
between habits that may be denominated good or
bad ; and secondly what are the most suitable
methods to prevent the one, and promote the o
ther. Having determined what acftions are im
proper, it will of course be enquired, what is
the belt way to fecureachild against the tempta
tion to commit them. Indolent or austere parents
will be apt to conclude at once, that feveie pro
hibitions are the most effectual security against
the allurements of vice and folly. Those who
are indolent wish to avoid the trouble of examin
ing the different springs of the human mind, and
therefore remain so ignorant of the true charac
ter of a rational being, that it is very doubtful
whether their children arc ever taught to love or
praiSice the moral duties. To make the matter
easy and cut short the labor of ejiquiry and in
vestigation, arbitrary regulations are adopted,
which fuggeftno other motive to shun evil acftions,
than what results from the fear of breaking
through prohibitions. Austere men being desti
tute of fine feelings, and an amiable disposition,
take delight inrigorous precepts and discipline.
Their temper is so morose and unindulging, that
they characterize as vicious and reproachful, ma
ny customs and habits, which in the view of other
people are innocent and even ufeful. It is obvi
ous to a moderate capacity that takes any pains
to reflect on the fubjedt, that such people will
generally find their children perverse and prone
to an excessive career of vice.
The great point to be accompliflied is to coun
teract and divert temptation to bad acftions, by
rendering an opposite conduct more delirable.
This can only be effected by creating motives
to a good conduct, that lliall be stronger than
what impel to a bad one. If children do not
take such pleasure in the company and approba
tion of their parents, asto make it their chief de
light to obey and gratify them, there is an end
to every reasonable hope of their being vir
tuous oramiable. By accumulating rigorous pro
hibitions children take a difgult against their pa
rents, and acquire an habitual inclination to
thwart and disregard their injunctions.
Every person ihould conclude that he is pursu
ing a wrong mode of education, if he finds that
his child does not prefer home to any other place,
anciconfider his parents as his belt friends and
soft entertaining companions. Asfoon as a youth
diÂ£ikes the company of his father, he will feel
inclination to dilobey his commands, and op
pose his wishes. In proportion as prohibitions
are rigid and numerous will the young reprobate
lengthen his fortitude to break them, or improve
his sagacity to elude them. He arts upon the pre
'ttmption, that they are all useless and arbitrary.
A youth let loofeupon a world full of tempta-
Uons and intrigues, with a persuasion that he has
been hood-winked and cltiped in his education,has
Jiothiijg to guide his future Iteps. It is altogether
a matter ot accident whether he makes a virtu
ous man or a knave and vagabond. One cannot
pronounce with any certainty what will be the
deltiTiy of such an adventurer. If he falls into
good company before he has been seduced by
a d,i L is poflible he may form good principles and
ts. But ihould he on his firft escape from pa
rental authority, meet with profligate aflociates,

SATURDAY, August 8,
SKETCH OF THE POLITICAL STATE OF AMERICA.
WHILE among the various objects whicli claim
the attention of government, none can be esteem
ed of more importance in their nature and con
sequences than the finances of this country ; per
haps in no other inftancehave the sanguine hopes
of individuals ledtliein into so wrong conclusions,
as to the immediate practicability of making the
proper arrangements of this comprehensive fub
jetft ; there can be no doubt, that for the revival,
eftablilhment and support of public credit, pro
vilion ought to be made as early as pollible for
the discharge of at least the interest of both the
foreign and domestic debt ; but we are on many
accounts notyet ripe for thel'e appropriations: The
doctrine of anticipating funds, is equally ruinous
to public as private measures : We have already
experienced great inconvenience and loss of cre
dit, by proinilling more than we have been found
able to perform : We ought therefore, in future,
to avoid by wiser plans of adminiltration, an e
vil of such a dangerous tendencyâlet time be
given to ascertain the nett product of our customs
and ability from other sources to answer the de
mands on government. âTo lhun the evil just
mentioned, would be a fufficient consideration to
juftify the policy of this mode of procedure ; but
an object of still greater consequence, prior to
making our appropriations, will be to have the
fifcal department of this country more compleat
ly lyftemized and Amplified ; as in its present
deranged and confuied state, it seems almost im
poflible to have a due idea or knowledge of it.
Requisitions totally complied withâothers â¢ in
part, and others not at all âthe accounts between
the States not yet adjusted, appear on the face of
the present fchedivle.âBut considering the har
raffed situation of the country during the late
warâthe confufion introduced by a fluctuating
currencyâour youth and inexperience in the sci
ence of fifcal legislationâthe weakness
federal compact, &c. &c.âa derangement of our
finances was rather to be expelled than admired
at : But as we now feel a more perfect consisten
cy in our political situation, and as the present
government poflefles most of the resources of the
country, it will be found not ofily expedient, but
indispensably neceflary to form a general liqui
dation of our domestic debt, consolidating the
whole into one great national massâby which we
{hall avoid much future confufion in its manage
mentâprevent a division of the public interestsâ
promote that general equality of circumstances
among the inhabitants of the Union, which will
produce a harmony both of sentiment and exer
tion in their duty to the public.
Though in making the arrangement, perfect
justice cannot be done to each individual istate,
it is a partial facrifice, which principles of pa
triotism and a regard to the future welfare of
their country mult prompt them to make to the
general good : Their respective balances can be
placed on the ground of other loans, subject to
similar terms of payment.
Upon a proper adjustment of these great princi
ples, and having from experience obtained an ac
curate knowledge of our n.ett income ; it will be
in the power of government, by the consent of
the public creditors, to eftablilh the domestic debt
on an interest of at moll 4 per cent, which will
make a laving of 547,678 2*9oths dollars per
annum compared with the present rate of inter
est as the debt now stands, at the fame time giv
ing iatisfacftinn to the lenders, as 4per cent, punc
tually paid; is far preferable to 6 per cent, only
promiifed, and in proportion as the rate of inter
est is lowered our power for punctual payment
will be encreafed.
Whatever neceflity may arise from the nature
of our contracts, to urge a discharge of the prin
cipal of the foreign debtâl do not fee either our
ability, the expediency or policy of attempting
at present a discharge any part of the princi
pal of the domestic ; as that properly funded, on
a moderate but sure interest, will form a nation
al stock or capital, and eflentially assist a general
circulationâthe progress of manufactures, and
internal laborâin promotion of which object, the
eftablilhment of a national bank under proper
regulations would be found lerviceable, into
which the money arilingfrom the public revenue
can be paid from time to time, and the officers
of the revenue be obliged to receive its notes as
cash in all payments : There is no nation better
adapted than this for such 'on eftablilhment, as its
commerce, resources and power are upon the en
creafe, which with the advanced rate of interest,
for even 4 per cent, is above the general funds
in Europe, will be to all appearance a fufiicient
inducement to foreigners, as well as natives, to
veil their property in the public funds of this
countryâl feel allured, that lliould our inclina-

tlon run parallel with our ability, we have it i ll
our power to place them on the moll respeCtable

PROGRESS OF MANUFACTURES.
IT niuft afford great pleasure to every well
wisher to his country, to fee the rapid progress
that manufactures are making among us.âWhile
under the lhackles of Great Britain every effort
of that fort was cramped, and their arts of Par
liament were numerous, fjr preventing every
attempt to promote them ; but no sooner.was our
Independence established, than the efforts of ge
nius prevailed, and the manufacture of Wool-
Cards,* in which upwards of eight hundred
persons, including men, women and children,
are daily employed in the town of Boston, has
arrived to such a degree of perfection, by the im
provements made in the machinery, invented by
the native genius of the country, as to rival the
Europeans in the fabrication of that article ; and
the States of America are supplied at near fifty
per tent, less than they used to pay for British
wool cards before the revolution : s That although
at prefeut the manufacturers are obliged to im
port the wire from Europe, yet under that dis
advantage they are able to make the cards, pay 1
a second freight to Europe, and under fell them
in their own markets.
Nor is the manufa<flure of Sail Cloth, lately
established in Boston, the leall esteemed for its
great utility and public benefit ; as moil of the
veflels fitted out of late, from this and the neigh
boring ports, are either partly or wholly cloath
ed from the Boston FaCtory, and the proprietors
ot the manufactory have the fatisfaCtion to find
that it is generally approved of, and has the pre
ference to European Duck. The lhort period
that has elapsed fmce the looms were firft produc
tive, affords but a single instance of a tris.l being
made of the cloth, which was pronounced by the
fifhermen, who used it upon the banks of New
foundland, to be " the best Canvass" they ever
failed with : and such is the encouragement giv
en to it, that, though they can turn out upwards
of twelve hundred yards a week, yet for the molt
part of the time, the elotli is anticipated in the
looms; as the public have the flattering prospeCt
that it will not be liable to mildew, owing to
the great care and pains taken in the fatftory to
prevent the use of any ingredient that may be
productive of it, and we have assurances from
the gentlemen interested in it, that if attention
is paid to the cultivation of flax, foastoafford
them an ample supply, they mean to extend the
manufacture so far as to turn out one hundred
pieces per week, which they are encouraged to
do from the disposition of the female part of the
community to contribute to so great a work ; and
I may,too aflert Meflis. Printers, that the establish
ment of the manufacture is much more owing
to their exertions in tine cause of industry than
to the Male part of the inhabitants.
I cannot conclude without remarking, that the
Nail Manufactory has so far succeeded as to
tally to preclude the neccffity of the importation
of that article, and instead of importing ntar
three thousand calks annually into this Common
wealth, we are able to supply our home consump
tion and export considerable quantities to other
marketsânor should I do justice to the manu
facture of Paper Hangings, not to mention the
great progress made in that art: A gentleman of
respeCtability in the town, concerned in thatbu
finefs, has declared, that if he can be allowed
one year to provide stock, he will engage after
that to make fufficient to supply the whole Uni
ted States, and as to quality, the productions
will fufficiently speak for themselves.âThe silence
that has been observed refpetfling our manufac
tures has induced the writer of this to remark
upon tliofe four capital branches ; much more
might be said upon many others of less impor
tance, which will probably be taken up in some
future paper. Herald o/'Freedom.

Paris, MAY 25.
IT is impoflible to paint to you the agitation of
men's minds at this most critical moment. Every
attempt is making to conciliate the three orders
of which the aflembly of the States General is
composed ; yet the public fears continue to pre
ponderate'over their hopes, and a schism, with all
its dreadful consequences, seems to be thegener
al appreheiifion. The twenty representatives of
the commons of Paris take their feats to-morrow,
so that the alfembly will proceed inltantly to
bring matters to a crisis. The commons have na
med a conciliatory commiflion of lixteen to con
fer with the other two orders ; the clergy eight,
and the nobles eight; but the election of the lat
ter, on a scrutiny, has unfortunately fallen on
the moll ariltocratical members of that body,
whole general lentiments may be deduced from
the numbers on the firit grand divilion, when the
minority, in favor of the union of the three or
ders tonlilled only of forty-feven against sBB.â
The famequeftion was carricd against the popu
lar with by a much smaller majority in the cler
gy, viz. 122 against 114. âThe parochial eccleli
altics, or representatives of the rectors ofparifhes
in the National AHembly being almost to a man
inclined to the caufeof freedom, a weight, which
added to the patriotic Nobles lliould it be at length
determined to vote by numbers in a mixed ailetn
bly, would turn the scale decidedly in favor ol
the nation. Every thing, therefore, to be ex
pected from this momentous meeting hinges on
this decifionâfor there seems but little, if any
room for modification. The Aftembly of the
Third Estate abounds 111 men of the greatelt a
bility and firmnels ; their information and elo
quence have already aftonilbed the persons who
have alfifted at their preliminary debate. The
following are the lixteen members named on the
conciliatory commiilion, lome of whom are no
strangers to the literary world in EuropeâMefl'rs.
Rabaud de St. Etienne, le Chapelier, Mounier,
Taget, (of the French Academy) Bailey (of the
fame) Touret, Milfier, Dupont, le Grand, Vol
nfcy, (author of the Travels in Syria and Egypt)
Rhedon, Liquier, Carat, Salomon, Bergafle, and
Barnard. 1 hefe deputies have received express
orders to enter into no matter whatever, but an
invitation to the privileged orders to unite and
verify their refpedtive powers in common,the firft
llepto their voting promifcuoudy together. And
secondly, to keep an exadt regifterof what pailes
at the conference. This conference, therefore,
will neceflarily bring on the grand question.
On VVednefday lalt, the clergy, by a consider
able majority, agreed to renounce all their pecu
niary privileges and exemptions. The nobles are
expected to adopt the fame measure ; but the vio
lence with which they are daily attacked on all
their lofty pretensions, has almost driven many
ofthem to wish to make a stand; nay, evenroyaf
ty itfelf is already said to call a longing retrofpedt
on past times, and to dread the Ihock of that mass
whose momentum is not to be withllood.
In the environs of the capital, 1 5,000 men, in
cluding 4000 horse, are hourly expected, belides
the usual garrison of the French and Swiss guards,
&c. though it is now said the order for a camp is
countermanded. The execution of the rioters
took place on Friday, without any tumult, owing
to the presence of all the military in and about
Paris.
The Dauphin's illness has taken rather a fa

This Prince, whose reign will probably form

He speaks several languages with facility and

It is thought that his elevation to the throne
will produce a revolution in the manners of the

In the fortitude and perseverance of the citi

greatly enhanced by a reflection that their public
virtue had been finally crowned with complete

I am now truly happy that my motives, for re
a(fuming the arduous duties of a public station,
have met with your approbation. And at the fame
time I entreat yon will be persuaded that no
thing could be better calculated to encourage me
to hope for prosperity in the execution ofthe duties

I request, gentlemen, that you will accept my

approbation and signature, viz. The bill for es
tablishing Light-Houles, Deacons, Buoys, and
public Piers, the bill for establishing the govern
ment of the Western Territory, and the bill for
establishing the War Department.
The engrofled bill for allowing compensations
to the members and officers of the two Houses
was readâa motion was then made by Mr. Sedg
wick, that the fame fliould be recommitted, tliis
motion was seconded by several members, which
brought 011 a debate.âln favor of the motion it
was observed, that If the bill Ihould become a law
in its present form, there was danger of its hav
ing an inauspicious influence upon the reputation
of the government, That tlielalariesofof the 1110 ft
refpe&able officers in some of the States, and
particularly in Maflachul'etts, where the Gover
nor receives but 8001. a year, and the Judges of
the Superior Courts but 3001. and where the pub
lic business is executed by men of the lirft abili
ties, and no difficulty exiits in procuring the most
competent talents for every departmentâwould
lead to enquiries upon these allowances, which
it would be difficult to answerâthat the compen
sations proposed to be given to some of the of
ficers of Ccngrefs, will be considered as a profufe
andthoughtlefs application of the public money,
and as greatly overating the services for which
such compensations are allowedâthat in particu
lar the fiiiii of 730 dollars to the door-keeper, was
so out of proportion toother compensations as to
render the bill tnconfiftent with itfclfâthat it
was contrary to the rule adopted by the House,
with refpec r t to other appointments, especially the
clerks in several departments, to some of which
it was with difficulty that the House consented to
allow 600 dollars, where talents and great ref
ponfibiliry were expec'ted.
On the other hand it was said that the bill had
received repeated discussions, that it was now in
the third stage of its progress, and if gentlemen
hadferioufly thought of making so strenuous an
oppolition. they ought to have come forward at
an earlier dayâthat it would but ill comport with
the principles of economy which some gentlemen
appeared to advocate, to spend any more time in
a tedious difcuflion of a bill which has so long
been before the house : That if the bill was not
10 perfectly accurate as some gentlemen wished,
yet it would be more eligible to pass it, than to
lacrifice the time of the House in going over the
S'ound again, especially as every part of it had
received the fandtion of a refpeilable majority
~That the motion was entirely our of order, and
1 the rules of the House were thus to be broken
through, it was in the power of the disappoint
' forever to impede the public businessâthat
to the small salaries given in particular States,
e circumltances did not apply, as gentlemen

The question for the re-coinniitment was de

viz. Instead of two days pay as an allowance for
every twenty miles diltance from the feat of go

PHILADELPHIA, AUGUST J.
A veflel arrived here on Saturday last from the
Streights, which brings a report of the affafiliation
ofthe celebrated Paul Jones, by a Britilh officer
in the Ruffian navalfervice : Cut we can collect
no particulars of the horrid transaction. Itfeems,
however, that he acquired great applause at the
Court of Peterfburgh, in projecting and effecting
the demolition of the Turkish fleet, under the
command of the famous old Captain Pacha, the
last campaign. That brilliant action, added to
former grudges, and resentments which the un
generous Englifli officers bore towards him, pro
bably determined them,at all events, to rid thein
felves of so formidable a rival.
We are happy in informing our readers, that
in the memory of the oldest man among us, a
more plentiful year has not been known than the
present. Neither mildew nor fly has affeCled the
wheat ; the grain is heavy and full, and in large
quantities. The other grains are likewise plen
ful, and of an excellent quality. Such distin
guished favors call for the gratitude of the in
habitants of the United States, to the great Au
thor of Nature ; especially when tliefe blessings of
nature are connected in the fame year with deli
verance from anarchy, aud with the establish
ment of a wife, free and jull government.
Wednesday last, William Cole was executed
on the commons of this city, for robbing 011 the
Waflaliickon road, two country men coming to
market.âHe had two accomplices in that bulinefs,
who are not yet taken, and all of them had but
a few days escaped from the jail in this city, be
ing sentenced to hard labor for Tome years as a
punishment forfundry depredations on the inha
bitants in and near this city. Cole had proved
himfelf incorigible by repeated robberies. It is
said that from his sentence to his execution, his
behavior was suitable to his deplorable situation.

Capt. Selman, of Marblchead, returning from
the banks of Newfoundland, on the firft of Ju
ly, had his vefli-1 ftruckby a whale, which foun
dered in nine minutes afterâthe Captain and his
crew immediately took to their boat, and after
experiencing a variety of diftrefles, and figular
inltances of providential interpolitions in their
favor, arrrived home in fafety.
The building of the Indiainan, at Braintree,
goes on with rapidityâand, it is said, will be
lanclied about the 20th OCtober. This veflel is
about 850 tons burthenâand is pronounced by
judges to be an excellent piece of workmanihip.
Information having been received at the Custom
House in Portland, Cafco Bay, that a Sloop of 30
tons had anchored at Cape Cove r Cape Elizabeth,
from the coast of Guinea, the Naval Officer im
mediately repaired thither. âOn examination it
was found by the confeflion of one Hans Hanfon,
that the sloop failed from London about a year
last March, that she was commanded and chiefly
owned by one John Connorâthat they proceeded
to the coast of Guinea, and purchased the cargo
of ivory, pepper, See. which they now have on
boardâthat a plan was concerted to kill Capt.
Connor, which was executed in December last,
and that one Jackson was appointed Captain in
his steadâthe said sloop was taken pofleflion of
and carried into Portland.
august i. Of the murder of Capt. Connor, in
the sloop lately seized at Portland, we further
learn : That the persons on board at the time of
the murder, were named Haddy, Jack/on, Bird,
and Hanfon ; âThat in November last, Bird and
Haddy, agreed to kill the Captain, and run-away
with the veflel,and executed their purpofe,by dis
charging two small arms upon him, down the
companion door, and a scuttle 011 the quarter
deck, while he \yas asleep; they then threw him
overboard, and Haddy took the command, and
some time after failed for the Spanifli Main,
where he intended to fell her ; but not being
able to reach the coast, he gave the command to
Jackson, told him to carry her whither he pleased,
and died not long afterwards âThat Jackson de
clared his design was to carry the veflel to Boston.
âJackson fa. s he is a native of Newton, in this
Slate, aud, as Hanfon fays, was asleep in the fore
part of the veflel when the murder was commit
ed, and knew nothifio; of itâThat the account
â¢.O. , â¢ C
! Hanfon gives of lumfelf, Is, that he is a native or
Norway, an apprentice to Cap. Connor, aged 19
âand that the extreme cruelty of Cap. Connor,
was the pretended reason for the murder. The
Sheriff of Cumberland has taken an inventory of
the cargo, &c. to keep in pofleiiion for the owners.
NEW YORK, AUGUST 8.
1' ROM A CORRESPONDENT.
Tliofe who contemplate the true springs and
principles of human nature, anticipate advanta
ges from the liberal compeniation that is to be al
lowed to our National Legiilators and t,he officers
who attend them. Had alefs rate of pay been af
fixed, it probably might have produced the appro
bation and applause of those persons, who are
more diftinguiihed for zeal and economy, than
for knowledge and discernment. lie must have
lliglitly observed the character of man, who has
not found out, that indolence is one of his pre
dominating qualities. Unless some powerful
ftimulusis 1 uggefted languid will be
and inefficacious his pursuits. Ambition and ava
rice are two operative springs of the human
mind. The force of the former will be rendered
weak in the breasts of our legislators by the out
cry that has been injudiciously raised against titles
of diftindiion.âWe must therefore have recourse
to the former ; for we go upon the presumption,
that man can only be roused into adtive exertions
by strong incentives. The business of the United
States must not be fufFered to stand ltill; and
the public welfare will be far more endangered
by'too small, than by too liberal an allowance to
public officers.
The establishment of a National Bank ap
pears to be an objetft of very general expectation :
Such a plan would give a lpring to trade and com
merce through the States, by introducing a com
petent circulating mediumâby enabling Congrefis
and thefeveral States to realize to the public cre
ditors some part at lealt of their jult demands,
and by restoring a confidencc in the national
faithâit would unlock the iron repositories of ma
ny a tlioufand rusty dollars, which have long
been confined by the wary proprietors, left they
ffiould on being released, make to themselves
wings of paper and fly away.âThis plan will also
conduce to strengthen the national government,
and to remove jealousies refpedting particular
States accumulating mors, while they pay less than
their proportion of the public revenueâFor the
bills of the national bank being unlimited in
their circulation through the States, superior
industry alone, will add to the aggregate amount
in any particular State.
The confidence which is already created in the
new government, bids fair to excite a rivalihip
among monied men, in the terms on which they
propose to make their loans for the immediate
exigencies of the Unionâand if this is the cafe,
as it must be undoubtedly, except we suppose
that mankind are blind to their own interestâ
a competition on this fubjecft may more reasona
bly be expe<sted among the several banking com
panies in the United States.
By the arrival ofaveflel at New-London from
Port-au-Prince, we learn, that a 74 gun ship, and
5 or 7 frigates were to fail in a few days for New-
York orÃofton, to pais the hurricane months.
Extract oj a letter from a gentle?nan in Philadelphia,
to his friend in this city.
" I have read, with attention, the report of the
committee of the House on the fifth article of
the constitution : Should the proposed amend
ments be adopted, I have no doubt they will give
general fatisfaetion, and quiet the minds of ma
ny well disposed citizens. I observe a bill has
pafled the lower house, organizing the general
board of coinmiffioners ; that business is very im
portant, as the harmony and peace of the dif
ferent States, in a great measure, depend on a
final adjustment of their accounts. From the
loose manner the accounts have been kept in, in.
moftof the states, the business must be complicat
ed ; and it would require men of experience and
abilities to investigate these accounts. For the;
small salaries allowed by Congress, I am persuad
ed the coinmiffioners will find it difficult to pro
cure persons qualified to execute this business ;
and an ambarraffinent of this nature would certain
ly be very injurious to the public. An allowance
of 1000 dollars to the chief clerk, and adifcreti
onary power vested in the coinmiffioners to ap
point as many assistants as the business might
require, at a falarynot exceeding 600 dollars per
ann. would not, in my opinion (with fubmiffioii
to the honorable house) be deemed an extrava
gant compensation ; the public might then expecJt
to have the business well executed, as persons of
abilities, I presume, might be engaged 011 tliefe
terms."
