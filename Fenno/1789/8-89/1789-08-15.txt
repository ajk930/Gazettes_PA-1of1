a Whether the winner laughs or not, the lofsr wih
complain."
THE sources of clamor and disquietude in
any society multiply in proportion as
it becomes opulent and civilized. Nothing is
more evident than that competition is a very for
cible spring at - r tiÂ° n â¢ unless there are more
n)e u than bufinel's, more candidates than offices,
private as well as public affairs will be managed
v itli and inattention. The competitors
are of course engaged in a kind of warfare with
each other ; and are only reflraiued from violent
hostilities by thole fenriments of politeness and
propriety, which are inspired by good-breeding
aid a knowledge of the world. It is eaiy how
ever to distinguish the different lides in which
men range tliemfelves, and the different objects
tbev are pursuing. Those who are rivals may
carry external marks of good-willand confidence,
but the disguise is easily penetrated. As those
â who are dilappointed and discontented form a
more numerous class, than those who are fatisfied
andfucccfsful, it mull be expedled that complaints
and reproaches will give the predominating tone
toconverfation. In whatever company one falls
itmcft not therefore agitate him to find a strong
propensity to complain.
In creating the various branches of the execu
tive department of government, it is natural to
expedthe number of candidate;, will far exceed
the places that are to be filled. This opens a
great scene of competition. The inevitable re
fultcf such a situation is, that many persons must
be disappointed, and foi.ie will be difgulted. It
would be paying too great a compliment to hu
man nature to imagine that, in the great num
ber whole expectations are fruftrated, there will
be none who secretly wish, and even openly de
monstrate theirwifhes, to impede the success, and
blur the reputation of our national government.
There is however a circumftaVice that will mueh,
though perhaps not totally restrain a dilpofition
tocenfure and oppofc the adminifbration.
Itisfo universally believed that our chief ma
gistrate, in all his measures aild appointments is
actuated by just and impartial motives,that few of
the disappointed will think it worth while to raise
clamors. The public ear will be shut against the
infiiroations of the artful, and the reproaches of
the petulant. As reltlefs and discontented men
are more adtive and vigilant, than those who en
joy a fatisfacftion of mind, either from fortunate
affairs, or from a natural calmness of spirits, there
will of course be more people to vex and difturh
the government, than to applaud and vindicate
its proceedings. From this view of the matter,
honest and moderate men, who have the public
prosperity at heart, should guard themselves a
gainllimproper impressions from those, who will
be apt to grumble through envy and disappoint
ment. There are unavoidably a great proportion
of persons in every society, who may be denomi
nated unfortunate. Whether their ill luck is the
elreCt of imprudence, or merely adverse fortune
it may have the fame influence on their temper,
andjudging by their own feelings,they may seri
ously imagine every thing is going wrong. In
every community fucli men are capable of doing
great mifchief. Thepeopleof the United States
are too well experienced in political tranfatftions
to be easily deceived, and drawn into tumult and
(Mentions. But still there is in human nature a
strong propensity to take part with the unfortu
nate, and to believe their complaints have some
foundation. (To be continued.)

REPRESENTATION and COMPENSATION.
I RECOLLECT but one good reason for a nu
merous representation of the people-âthat is, the
greater certainty of having their interests and
faitiments understood in the representative af
lembly. The objects of the national government
we not the local, but the general concerns. Of
fourfe, a moderate number is fufficient. Refpon
"bility decreases as the body increases. In a small
embly a member has more to do, and more to
answer for. He is more in public view, and feels
'Sindnftry, and his generous paflions excited by
Mroiiger ftimutus. In a numerous aflcmbly he

fides are divided, strongly marked and agitated
by the spirit of their body (l'efprit de corps, as
the trench term it.) In faCt, all great afleniblies
have been led astray by the spirit of party. Per
haps all parties are nearly equally^-indiCtive,vio
lent and blind. The true check upon them is
the interpofitionof the public sentiment. A free
press, and an enlightened people will form a con
foul over all parties ; and oblige them to seek
the means of superiority and power by the pro
motion of the public good. Party spirit is an
evil ; but it is the inevitable confequence.of a nu
merous aflembly. It is not, however, impoilible
to draw good from evil. These are the confe
rences which result from the principles; but it
is obviously preferable to exclude the evil, if pofli
ble. 1 hough parties may promote the public
good, they often do infinite mifchief. Tlieydif
turb the tranquility, impair the happiness, and
endanger the fafety of lociety.
Whether it is polfible so to constitute a small
aflembly as wholly to banilh, or in a considerable
degree to restrain this spirit, is a problem of some
nicety. Its solution is highly important to man
kind, and especially to the United States. A go
vernment strong by the means of a rich treasury,
by troops, and by the habits of a people broken to
lubjection may be disturbed, but will not be en
dangered by party disputes. But in Ameriea,
government reds on public opinion, and we
lhould carefully avoid those causes which are
powerful enough to subvert its foundations.
In forming a legillative aflembly, we should
counteract as much as poflible the gregarious dis
position of the members, which is the aliment of
faction. It will be neceflary to analyze the hu
man character, and to lay open the motives which
lead public men to combine together, and to act
in parties. It is true that a public life calls forth
the strongest paflions of the heart. But it is also
true that these paflions are not continually in ac
tion. On great and rare occasions, they are rou
sed to aCt with violence. But ordinarily they are
held suspended by motives oflefs strength, but of
a more uniform and permanent influence. These
motives are the fenfeof weakness, the love of ease,
and the love of power.
Suppose a member of csmmon ability in an as
sembly of fifty. He has a fiftieth part of the du
ty, as well as of the weight of the body. Increase
the aflembly to two hundred members. His voice
will lose three fourili's of its influence. He
will lose more of his responsibilityâbe further
removed from public viewâand as party influence
will be more active, he will probably loose nine
tenths of his personal weight, and his vote will
become proportionably oflefs consequence to his
conflituents, and to the public. Suppose him a
weak but well intentionedman, hisfenfe of weak
ness and sense of duty will combine to subject him
to the influence of some leading member. Know
ing that his voice will not govern the vote of any
other, and doubting how to give his own, he will
relieve his fufpence by following the guide in
whom he places most confidence.
The love of ease is a more powerful agent than
is generally fuppoled. It is the greatelt impedi
ment to eminence. Reft is the reward of labor,
and the hope of this reward is probably one ofthe
springs of action, even with those men who seem
to abhor repose. We compare action with reft.
We calculate the value of the object proposed to
be attained by our exertions, and the price of
those exertions. A member conscious of being
able to effect little, singly, will not make the at
tempt. He will be obliged to add his strength to
a party. There is something unaccountable in
the fympathv of many minds. Probably a large
aflembly of the wisest men would not be wholly
exempt from that distrust of their own under
standings, and that complacency towards the er
rors and wishes of one another which has been
found totally to banish reason, and even human
ity, from mobs and riotous meetings.
That the administration of a government should
correspond with its principles, and be secured
from faction and commotion, it seems to be im
portant that the legislative powers should be lod
ged in as few hands as may be neceflary for pro
curing information of the stare of the society,
and that they fliould be carefully selected from the
best informed and best disposed citizensâmen,
who understand, and are able to manage business,
and who, in a body of fifty, are individually im
portant, will act more according to the dictates
of tlieir own understandings, and be less influen
ced by party paflions than the aflembly of two
hundred. The great question of the Conftituiion
had divided the community. It was natural to
expect the newCongrefs would be tinctured with
the hue of the rival parties. It is not owing to
any miracle, suspending the human paflions, that
the national legislature has been so remarkably
rPublijhid on Wednesday and Saturday.
diftingiiiilied by the spirit of candor and mode l "
ation. Nothing like faction or cabal and intrigu e
has been charged upon that bodyâand the pub
lic are disposed to think favorably of their patri
otism and independency of fentiinent. Two
events may be contemplated, either of which
would wholly change the character and conduct
of the aflembly ; increasing the number of the
members would expose the government to fac
tionâit would diminilh the agency of the under-
Handing, and augment that of the paflions. Im
proper persons would more easily get elected.
For the number of suitable perlons is not great
in any countryâof these, many will be indisposed
to the duty. Probably, this country is as little
deficient in this refpedt as any whatever. If how
ever more representatives are to be elected than
a due proportion of those who are willing and
qualified to serve, the probability of inferior can
didates being elecled will rife. Learned men
have disputed whether so large a territory could
remain united under one government, even if the
administration lhould beentrufted to men of con
summate wisdom and incorruptible virtue. The
chance would be made considerably more unfa
vorable by the appointment of men of a different
character.
To make the people happy, and the govern
ment permanent, two principles mult be regard
ed. That the members of the legislature be few,
and that provision should be made for drawing
forth the belt qualified citizens to serve.
In a republic, it is not neceflary, perhaps not
fafe, that a citizen lhould be allowed, and surely
he lhould not be obliged to lay the public under
obligations of gratitude to him by serving at a
loss. Pay for services is as republican as it is
equitable. Adequate compensation may be un
derstood very varioully in its application to parti
cular cases. It niuft always mean such compen
sation as will secure to the public the perform
ance of the services in question. If the pay of the
members of the Legislature is eftablilhed at an
higher rate than is neceflary to secure the atten
dance of men belt qualified to serve, it is impro
per. The interest of the people requires the a
doption of the principle infilled upon. Many will
dispute the application of the doctrine to the cale,
though none will deny the docftrine itfelf. The
dispute, if any lhould arise, will be of the left
consequence, because as it is a question of fa<ft
only, no inference unfavorable to the intentions
of thehoufe could be drawn from the tenor of the
bill which has palled the house of representatives.
Those who may happen to be violent on the fub
jetft, will be sorry tofind anyreafons to vindicate
what has been done, because it will disappoint
their pallions of an expeCted gratification. But
candid men will conlider the principles which
have been difcufled in this speculation, and they
will not overlook the rate of compensation which
has been allowed to members of the former Con
gress by the refpcclive Statesâthe average of
which is said to be equal to the fuin proposed by
the bill. They will alio note that that body being
in feflion the whole year was better paid than the
new Congress, which, probably, after the firft
year will not fit more than one fourth of the time,
and that the recefles, and the diminiflied bufmefs
of eighteen hundred members of tlje State Legi
(latures will make a saving by the national go
vernment. Perhaps, however, it would have been
advifableto have reduced the pay, as it is not an
objeCl which the members will deem a balance
for any fubtraiflion of the approbation and con
fidence of the people.
Another circumstance is worthy of being men
tioned. The difficulty of preserving a govern
ment over a great traCl of country is principally
in proportion to the inconvenience of aflembling
the members from the extreme parts to the feat of
government. Very low pay would render this
inconvenience speedily intolerable, and produce
a general desire for a division of the Union. The
distant members fubniit to a kind of banilhment,
and cannot regulate their private concerns. This
furnilhes 110 reason for profufion and extravagance
âbut it is hereby a caution against extreme par
simony. There is a just medium which is to be
preferedâit will extend the principle of Union
to the extremities, and bring the outside of the
circle nearer to the centre. The people will con
lider, therefore, whether the Union is not more
valuable than any other objedt, and whether they
would delire to have any small savings of money,
which, in any future period, lhould endanger
that blelling. Thele observations are submitted
to the candid public. If upon an impartial ex
amination, they lhould be found to have less weight
than the writer has given them, the voice of the
public will unquestionably reach the walls of the
Legislature. For in this country, the general
sentiment of the wife and worthy is law.A/tf. tEXNO,
If you and your brother-editors can find room for
the following remarks, amflng your political disquisi
tions, you may forward the work of improvements in
literature, and by Jhaking the throne of prejudice and
fa/fe philosophy, you may bring about a revolution in
favor of common sense.
THKRE is not a subject in literature so ge
nerally defpil'ed as Grammar ; yet there is not a
I'ubject of more consequence. The reason why
it is lo odious to every body but schoolmasters,
may perhaps be this. The authors who have trea
ted ol' this fubjedt, however eminent for erudi
tion, have been wholly ignorant of the origin
and conftrudtion of the Engliih language ; and
have, by falfe arbitrary rules, attempted to dis
card the idioms of the language, and introduce
iomething different frt>m common practice. Now
real Grammar is nothing but common practice ;
and when a man rises up and tells a nation, they
are all blockheads, and their language incorredt,
and vulgar, it is but jult that they in return Ihould
call him a pedant, and despise his rules. This
has been the fate of the three molt celebrated
philologersofthe Engliih nation, Johnl'on, Lowth,
and Harris. These writers, great indeed in Greek
and Latin, but knowing nothing of the true prin
ciples of English, have labored to prove their na
tive language full of errors and defects, and to
correct the one and supply the other by foreign
rules. The authority of their names has had an
unhappy effect upon the languageâit has pcr
fuaded the learned to resign the true idioms of
the language and introduce many corruptions in
to books ; while the body of the nation, govern
ed by habit, retain their former practice. Hence
the difference between the language of books
and con verfationâa difference generally illfound
ed, and improper. To lheW how I'uperficially
some of these great men, as they are called, have
conlidered the fubjeit, letme request my readers
to attend to the following examples. Lowth tells
us, that the phrase I am mijlaket:, means I am mif
underjlood. Strange indeed that so great a man
Ihould be so mijlakeu. Let me ask what is it that
conltitutes the meaning of a word ? Every ration
al man will reply, the sense which a whole nation
itnnex to it in praaiee. If I fay, /am mijlaken, does
not every man, woman and child understand me
to mean, lam wrong, or in an error' my ft If? This
cannot be denied. This common under/landing then
conltitutes the truefignitication of the phrase, and
no man, not even a Right Reverend Father in
God, has a right to fay it is not the meaning. The
truth is, when applied to persons, miflaken is al
ways used in this sense, and in no other. It has
loft its participial meaning; in the fame manner
as fraught and drunken, tlio derived from freight
and drink have loft all idea of action and become
mere adjectives ; so that it is improper to use
them in the participial manner ; he has fraught a
vsjfsl, a man has drunken. Yet as adjectives de
noting a quality, the one denoting very full, the
other a Jlate of intoxication, they are both correct
andexprelfive ; a man fraught with mifchief, a drunk
en man.
Lowth fays likewise adjeÂ«Â£tives are improperly
used for adverbs ; as extreme cold. Why did the
good Bilhop overlook the phrases full sweet, very
cold ! Will any man deny the latter to be good
Engliih ? It will be laid very is an adverb. Not
at all: The adverb is verily. Very is always an
adjective, as, this is the very man : It is limply the
Fiench vrai, true ; formerly written in Engliih
veray, and in modern times, very. The truth is,
it is an idiom of the language, co-eval with its
formation, that one adjective may qualify another:
and the idipm of the language is not only one,
but the only ground of grammatical rules. Yet
this idiom has always been overlooked.
.Another example. Dr. Samuel Johnson writes
" he needs not be very carefulinltead of the
common phrase, he need not. How surprizing it
is that a whole nation Ihould overlook the real'on
why need, in the usual practice offpeaking, iscor
rect Engliih, without the personal termination !
Need when used alone and followed by an object,
is regular; he needs support. But when followed
by another verb, it is considered as a helper, 1 as
well as will, can or may ; and he needs not go, is as
bad Engliih as he wills not go, or cans not go. This
diftindtion has been observed in will, he will not go,
he wills it, and why it Ihould have been overlooked
in need and dare, when it is strictly observed in
practice from the prince to the wajher-womati, is
really surprizing.
Lowth, with his head full of Latin rules, re
commends averse from instead of averse to ; and
many American writers have adopted it. From
is a noun fignifying beginning and to, a noun lig
nifying end. " A man goes from New-York to
Bolton; "That is, "he goes beginaing NewYork,?W
Bollon. This conltruition is not more curious
than true ; as modern discoveries have clearly
proved, that rude nations talk firft by names on
ly ; and that all our particles, are old Gothic
nouns and verbs. lam averse from war, therefore
is simply this, lam averse beginning war. This
is not the meaning ; for averse denotes a quality
or state of the mind, beginning in my own brealt,
and directed to the object, war. Hence the old
phrase averse to is correct, and will ltand the test
of all the criticism in the nation.
I will not multiply examples. Horne Tooke
has made some valuable discoveries, which will be
the bads of the firlt English Grammar ever pub
lished. The philological writers in America,
have not the authority of a Right Rtverend, a
D. D. or a L. L. D. to give weight to their opin
ions ; but their attempts to correct the taste of
our youths, by ftrippiug the learningof thi3 coun
try of its pedantry, will finally prevail over pre
judice, and call back the lludentto the principles
of common sense.
SKETCH OF PROCEEDINGS OF CONGRESS.
In the HOUSE of REPRESENTATIVES of the
UNITED STATES,
WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 12, lj8<).
THE engrolled bill, providing for the expell
ees which may attend negociations, and treating
with the Indian tribesâand for appointing com
lnilliofiers to superintend the fame, was read,
when the House proceeded to fill up the blanks.â
It was moved that thefum of forty one thousand
dollars be inferred in the firft blank. This mo
tion was oppoled by Mr. Sumpter, Mr. Gerry,
and Mr. Livermoreâlt was said, that a previ
ous estimate of the expences neceflary to be incur
ed, ought firft to be exhibited to the houseâthat
great frauds and abuses had been complained of
in tliefe negociationsât'lat the whole amount of
the revenue would fall short of the neceflary ex
pences of the current year, and therefore it was
incumbent 011 the House to grant monies with due
caution and deliberationâThat it could not be
contended that so large a sum was requifitp, but
011 the supposition of a very large number of In
dians' attending, and presents being provided for
thein âIt was urged that the treaties would be as
efficacious without collecting a whole nation to
getherâand the custom of giving presents
was reprobated by some of the members, as a mea
sure fraught with useless expence, much milchief,
and inconvenience.
Mr. Jackson, Mr. Hartley, Mr. Clymer,
and Mr. Baldwin supported the motionâThe
latter gentleman produced a statement of the ex
pences which would arise from holding a treaty
with the Creek nation only, of which it was ex
ped;ed that 1 500 would attendâlt was observed
that the sum moved for was to defray the expen
ces of treating with the Indian tribes in general
âmore particularly with the Wabafh nation, aiid
with the tribes to the southward of the Ohioâ
That agreeably to the estimate, which was laid
on the table, the whole sum moved for would be
necefliiry ; but if the house chose to have the
treaties conducted upon different principles from
what has been customary, they can make such al
terations as they may fee proper.
The motion for 41000 being put, it parted in the
negative. Mr. Madison then moved that the
blank should be filled with 40000 âthis was like
wise opposedâand the <yejand noes called for on
the queltionâwhich are as follow :

T HURSDAY, AUG. 13.
The engrofled bill providing for the expences
of negociations and treating with the Indians,
& c. was read, and palled to be enacted.
Mr. Lee moved that the House should resolve
itfelf into a committee of the whole on the state
of the Union, to take into consideration the re
port of the committee on amendments to the
Constitution.
The immediate adoption of this motion was
advocated by Mr. Madison, Mr. Page, and Mr.
Hartleyâand opposed Jjy Mr. Sedgwick v
Smith, (S. C.) Mr. Gerry.Mr. Laurance' and
Mr. ShermanâThe latter gentlemen general]
obi'erved, That there was a great variety of bu/
ness before the lioufe, which it is of tht created
importance fliould precede the conliderati on V
all otherâthat it appears absurd to make altera
tion in a form of government, before it has a"
operative existenceâthat it is of the firft cons
quence to compleat the judiciary billâ that with
out this and l'everal other bills now pending j,
the house, we cannot carry one of the revenue
laws into executionânot a breach of the lav, , f
the United States can be punifliedâ not a veflel
can be seizedâThe difcullion of the subject at this
moment will obftrud the wheels of government
and throw every thing into confufionâmeantime
the United States are without law, and have no
authority topvuiiih a single crime. It was further
said, that few, if any of the State allemblies are
in fellion, and therefore it will unneceflarily con
sume the preient time, which is so preciousâthat
the people reposing full confidence in tlie justice
and wisdom of the House that this fubje<ft would
have seasonable and due attention paid to it are
as anxious and solicitous to fee the government
in operation, as they are about amendments.
The Speakers against the motion severally ex
prefled tliemfelvesin favor of taking up the fub
jecft as fo?n as the judicial, executive, and revenue
departments were so far completed that it could
with propriety be said that we had a government.
In support of the motion it was observed,â
That since the ftlbjed had firft been introduced, so
much time has elapsed, that if it is not novvtaken
up, the people will be led to suppose, that it is
the intention of Congress never to do anything
in the bufinelsâthat the people are extremelv
anxious upon the fubjedâand nothing short of a
convidion tliat'thofe rights, which they conccive
to be in danger as the Constitution now Hands,
will be placed in a state of greater security, will
quiet their apprehensionsâthat the number of
those in favor of amendments conliftcd ofa large
and respectable proportion of the citizens of the
Statesâthat the peace and tranquility of the Uni
on depend upon a proper attention to their juit
expectationsâthat if those who are anxious for
amendments, had been added to those who open
ly opposed the Constitution, it would have pro
bably met a quite different fateâthat except these
amendments are made, the government will want
the confidence of the people, and that energy
which is necessary to its existenceâthat the fame
reasons for a postponement have repeatetflybeen
assigned, and there is 110 profped that a more con
venient opportunity will offer. The queftionoe
ing put 011 the motion of Mr. Lee, it pafledinthe
affirmative. The House accordingly formed in
to a committee of the whole.
Mr. Boudinot in the chair.
The report of the committee was then readâ
the firft article of which is in these words, viz.
11l the introductory paragraph of the Conftira
lion, before the words "We the people," add,
" Government being intended for the benefit of
the People,and the rightful eftablifhnieut thereof
being derived from their authority alone."
Mr. Sherman : I am opposed to this mode of
making amendments to the Conftitution âand am
for ftrikingout from the report of the committee
the firft article entirely. I conceive that we can
not incorporate these amendments in the body
of the Constitution. It would be mixing brass,
iron, and clayâit would be as absurd as to incor
porate an a<ft in addition to an ad:, in the body ot
the ad propoled to be amended or explained
therebyâwhich I believe was never heard of be
fore.âl conceive that we have 110 right to 00
this, as the Constitution is an ad of the people,
and ought to remain entireâwhereas the amend
ments will be the ad: of the several legislatures.
Mr. Sherman then read a proposition which he
moved should befubftituted in place oft he article
in the report.
This beingfeconded, brought on an intercity
debateâWhether the amendments fliould be in
corporated in the body of the Conllitution, or
made a diftind supplementary ad.
Mr. Madison fupportecl the former, and
that he did not coincide with the gentleman fro'
Connedicut : I conceive, said he, that tn ere
a propriety in incorporating the amendments'
the Constitution itfelf, in the several P' :ices ,-
which they belongâthe system will in that ca
be uniform and entireânor isthisan uncoinnio

will Hand upon as good a foundation as 11 ,
parts of the Constitutionâand will be fa"â¢ equally as good authority.âlam not however
â yfolicitqus about the mode, so long as the
is fully attended to.
jj r Smith, (S. C.) agreed with Mr. Madisonâ
1 read that clause in the Constitution which
311 vides that alterations and amendments when
Fa eed to, ihallbecom e part of the Constitutionâ
Ifoni whence he inferred, that it was evidently
the design of the framers of the system, that they
ihould be incorporatedânor is the house at li
berty ro adopt any other mode. Mr. Smith cited
the instance of South Carolina, who instead of
making a<fts in addition to acts, which had been
found extremely perplexing, repealed their laws
o-enerally, in order to form a more fiinple and
unetubarrafling code.
Mr. Livermore lupported the motion of Mr.
Sherman He adverted to the cuitom and usage
of the Britiih legiilature, and of thefeveral State
Ad'einblies; in forming 1 aws and additional acfts.
\\'e have no right, he observed, to make any al
terations or interlopations in the instrumentâit
will be attended with difficulties in some future
Joy.
Mr. Vining observed, that lie thought the
mode was not efientialâhe therefore adverted
to the expediency of the motionâadding amend
ments, Hud he, will be attended with a variety of
inconveniencies âit will distort the systemâit
will appear like a letter, which, carelessly wrote
in halte, requires a poftfeript much longer than
the original compositionâThis motion is found
ed upon the cuitom of amending a<fts by addition
al acts, to explain and amend preceding aifts, a
custom, which involves endless perplexities, and
has nothing in reason to recommend it. I hope
Sir, the motion will not obtain.
Mr. Clvmer advocated the motion : I wish Sir
that the Constitution may forever remain in its
original form, as a monument of thewifdom and
patriotism of those who framed it.
Mr. Stone was in favor of Mr. Sherman's mo
tion. If Sir, said he, the amendments are incor
porated in the instrument, it will allert that which
is not true âfor this Constitution has been signed
by the delegates from the fcveral States as a true
inftrument âand therefore in this cafe we mull
go further, and fay, that a constitution made at
i'uch a time was defective, and George Wash
ington, and those other worthy characters who
fi<nied this instrument, cannot be said to have
signed the Constitution.âAccording to the obser
vation of the gentleman from South-Carolina,
refpe<fting repealing laws to make a complete
act, we must repeal the Constitution in order to
make a new oneâbut will any gentleman fay that
thislegiflature has authority to do this ? To in
corporate these amendments, the Constitution
must; however be repealed in parr, atleaftâThe
moment we prepare ourselves to do this, there is
an end of the Constitution, and to the authority
under which we act. Mr. Stone then replied par
ticularly to the inference drawn by Mr. Smith
from the pailage which he had quoted from the
Coiillitutioii, and observed, that the words could
not imply any thing more than this, that such
amendments, when adopted, agreeably to the
mode pointed out, would be equally binding with
the other parts of the system to which they do not
specially refer.
Mr. Gerry enquired whether the mode could
makeany polfible difference in the validity of the
system, provided the function is the sam
conceived it could notâThe constitution in my
opinion, said he, has provided that amendments
Ihould be incorporatedâthe words are express,
that they ihall becomc "part of this constitution."
The gentleman, (Mr. Stone) fays we fliall lose
the names of the worthy gentlemen who fubferib
ed the constitutionâbut 1 would alk, whether
the names would be of any consequence, except
the constitution had been ratified by the several
States ? or will the system be of no effect since it
is ratified, if the names were now erased ?âlfwe
adopt the mode proposed, wejhall in all probabi
lity go on to make fupplenients to supplements,
and thus involve the system in a maze of doubts
and perplexities.âlt appears to me, that in order
that the citizens of the United States may know
what the constitution is, it is neceflary that it be
comprized in one uniform, entire fyftem.âlf the
amendments are incorporated, the people will
have 0:1 c constitution ; but if they arc added by
way ot fapplement,they will have more than one:
And if in the original system there ihould any
claui'es be found, which are inconsistent with the
added amendments, the government will be com
pounded of oppoiite principles, both in force at
the fame time.
Upon the idea of gentlemen as to the facred
nefs of the original system, if amendment are
wade upon their plan, they will be considered in
a point of light inferior to the original ; in this
ew > amendments arc of no consequence, and
had better be omitted. âThis would tend to de
feat the salutary purposes of amendments altoge
ther, by derogating from their dignity and autho-
Mr. Laurance was in favor of the motion
made lij, Mr, Shermanâhe said, it appeared to
impuflible to incorporate the amendments in
' e '- ol iiti:inion without involving very great ab-
Surdities in the suppositionâis they should be
engrafted in the body of the constitution, it will
make it fpcak a language different from what it
originally didâWhat will become of the laws
enacted under the instrument as it originally
stood ?âWill they not be vitiated thereby ? The
ratifications of the several States had refpeCi to
the original fyfteni.âlt is true that a majority of
them have proposed amendments,but this does not
imply a nccelfity of altering the original, Co as
to make it a different system from that which was
ratified.âThe mode proposed by the motion is
agreeable to cultomâit is the least liable to ob
jection, and appears to me fafe and proper.
Mr. Benson observed, that this question was
agitated in the seleCt committee, and the result
is contained in the report now under confidera
tionâlt fliould be remembered, that the ratifica
tions of several oftlie States enjoin the alterations
and amendments in this way ; they propose that
some words should be struck out, and the fenteri
ces alteredâl do not conceive that incorporating
the amendments can affeCt the validity of the o
riginal constitutionâthat will remain where it is,
in the archives of Congress unaltered with all
the names of the original fubferibers.âThe a
mendments are provided for in that instrument,
and the compleating those amendments is com
pleating the original systemâthe records of the
legislature will inform how this was done ; âand
for my part, I can fee no difficulty in proceeding
agreeable to the report of the committee.
Mr. Page said that he supposed that the com
mittee of the whole is now aCting upon the con
stitution as upon a billâand they have a right,
said he, to take up the subjeCt paragraph by pa
ragraph.
1 am oppofedto the amendment of the pream
ble of the constitution as proposed by the com
mittee, as well as to the motion oftlie gentleman
from Connecticutâl could wish therefore that
we may not consume time in fetling the nicer form
of conducting the businessâbut proceed, after
rejecting the firlt amendment, to conficler those
that are subsequent in the report.
Mr. Livermore replied to Mr. Page â-he said,
that with respect to the constitution, the commit
tee ltood upon quite different grounds from what
they did when discussing a bill, and he contended
that it is not in the power either of the legiilature
of the United States, or of all the legislatures
upou the continent to alter the constitution, unless
they were specially empowered by the people to
do it.
Mr. Jackson advocated the motion of Mr.
Sherman âhe said, if we repeal this constitution
we shall perhaps the next year have to make ano
ther âand in that way the people will never be
able to know whether they have a permanent
constitution or not. âThe constitution in my opi
nion ought to remain sacred and inviolateâl will
refer to the couftitution of EnglandâMagna
Charta has remained as it was received from king
John to the present day, and the Bill of Rights
the fame; and although the rights of the people
in several respeCts have been more clcarly ascer
tained and defined, those charters remain entire :
A constitutional privilege has lately been esta
blished in the independency of the Judges, but
no alteration in the constitution itfelf was thought
proper. All the amendments are fupplementa; yâ
the sacred depolitof English liberty remains un
touchedâtheir great charter remains unaltered,
though defeats have been fapplied and additions
made. The constitution of the United States has
been made by thepeaple ; it is their own aCt, and
they have a right to it.âl hope we shall not do
any thing to violate or mutilate it.
I therefore heartily join in the motion for link
ing out the words and adopting the mode propo
sed by the gentleman from Connecticut.
Several of the gentlemen spoke repeatedly
upon the subjeCt, but time will not admit of our
enlarging further.âThe quelhon 011 Mr. Sher
man's motion being taken, it pafled in the ne
gative.
A doubt was then raised, whether it wasnecef
fary that the article in the constitution which re
quires that two thirds of the legislature should re
commend amendments, fliould be attended to by
the committee âthis oceafioned a debate, âan ap
peal was made to the chairman, who determined
that the business while before the committee,
fliould be transaCted in the usual manner by a
majorityâan appeal was made from this judg
ment to the house, and 011 the question, being
put, whether the chairman's clecifion was in or
der, it pafled in the affirmative.
The committee then rose, reported progress, and
had leave tofit again to-morrow. Adjourned.

NEW YORK, AUGUST ij.
Extratt of a letter from one of th: eastern States,
dated Aug. %.
" I perceive by the the proceedings of Con
gress, that the house are about to take up the
fubjed: of amendments to the constitutionâThis,
if true, will be considered by the friends to fe
deral measures, as a stretch of complaisance at
the expence of theintereft of the United States.
âI never yet met with a stickler for amendments
who entertained an idea that this business wouid
come upon the carpet, so long as Congrfefs had
any thing to do, that was elfential to the organi
zation of the government. Many persons are se
riously alarmed at this appearance, who have hi
therto repressed eVery repining thought, at the
llownefs with which public business has progrell
edâfuppofing that nothing would clivers. COll
- from the Heady pursuit of those objects on
which the hopesof every friend to the Union are
founded, till every departmer.it of government
was established and compleated, and the fyfteni
put in full operation."
A correspondent observes, that the fears of
those who have been anxious on the score of a
mendments, may be entirely done away j for
though a majority of the present Congress are
undoubtedly friendsto the newgovcrnmen. ; and
though the fubjeJl of amendments has lain dor
mant, yea, quite ulleep through the Stages lor
many months ; and though there is confefledly,
very important and neceflary business yet pend
ing in the legislature, and though the time of
adjournment draweth near ; and though the
fubjed: of amendments is a difficult business and
will take time and cx.use tedious debates, yet to
" quiet the alarms," to " dissipate the appre
lienfions" " allay the fears" and " annihilate
tliejealoufies or the people"âthe amendments
are to be immediately attended to.
Tliefubje<st of Amendments is now the general
topic of conversation :âThe fufpenfionthat is oc
calioned in the organization of the government,
by taking up this mo ft import ant of ail fubjefls at
this moment of leifure âthis pause in the general
expectations of tke people, mull be considered in a
pioper point of lightâfor tlio in two days a cer
tain aflembly have hardly got their hand upon
the knocke 01 the Door, as a certain hon. gen
tleman phraf-d it, yet the whole suit of apart
ments, nineteen in number, may be surveyed,
examined, altered, amended, curtailed,enlarged,
and appropriated, in days, weeks, or
months, at fartheft.

turning the bright fide to the day, and fitting off
her various improvements in a very confpicuons
