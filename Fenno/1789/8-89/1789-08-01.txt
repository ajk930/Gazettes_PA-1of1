Nothing can excite more unpleasant impreflions than to observe
a fortune, that has been acquired by honest industry, wafted 111
idleness and extravagance. It a proper fyft. mof education were
adopted, there is reason to suppose, that the offspring of opulent
families woul.d b? more likely thap others to manage their proper

public benefit, that property (hould often change its master .â
TJiere is however a degree of refinement in extending

i,fÂ£TCH-0{ THÂ£ POLITICAL STATE Of AMERICA.
ALTHOUGH present appearances do not
fceni to fuppjort the a'iertion, my ears are yet
dinned with the cry we not long since heard, " let
have a government adequate to the purpoles
of the Union, that we may no longer be the
d,upes of other powers, but that we may be able
taprove ourselves of some importance infociety,
have our commerce fubjetft to our own laws and
regulations,, and not subservient to the caprice of
anyparticulsyftatc,or guided by foreign interest."
âThat certain kinds of traffic may be advanta
geous to some individual adventurers, and yet
df general injury to the public, is fully mani
feftedby our present impolitic cpmnjerciaJ inter
course with Great Britain, which, upon an ag
gregate view, will be found to leave a heavy ba
lance against this, country, and unlcfs put upon a
Bore reciprocal footing, oughtto be totally anni
hilated : âOur circulating medium is daily drain
ed off in exchange for every frippery and fop
pery that the fertile invention of men has been
able to produce. âReason 2nd common sense
loudly picolaini fpr a remedy againlt so great an
evil.
We proceed to examine some of the means by
whicli America has it in her power to this
remedy; and as I think a presumption upon the
favorable tlifpofition of Great Britain can be no
longer contended for, it will be proper to exa
mine those parts of her trade with us, the loss
of which lhe will npr readily consent to, as
grounded upon her eflential interest, which we
have reason to conclude from her permiting it
to exift.âln a former paper, I mentioned out
pot and pearl aihes 3ud tlax-feed as necellary to
their manufaiftures, and which we know from the
test of experience, lhe cannot obtain so advan
tageaufly elsewhereâas the superior quality ol
these articles from this country find a market e
ven at a greater price, than those lrom the
northern parts of Europe, where they pro
duce but little flax-feed, and that of an inferior
quality, owing to the neccflity they are under for
the supply ot their duck and other manufacto
ries, of fufFeringthe flax, in order to obtain a due
degree of fibrous strength, to remain in the
ground beyond the proper time for extracting
good feed.âThe large quantities of tobacco, rice,
&c. imported from this country into Great Britain,
and from thence exported to the various parts oi
Europeâ employs so many of their Ihips âforms
so advantageous a vend for their manufactures
m its purchase, and gives so good a cominiflion
to their merchants that they would not very will
ingly relinquish a trade offuch importance, wijiile
neither the Brufils or the Indies can supply them
SATU RD A i, August I, 17^9.
with equal advantage thro' the interference of the
tt'ortugueie in the form er, and the distance of the
latter, which would cause the freight to exceed
the price of the article in this country ânor do
chey from their situation, require so great a share
of their manufactures.âlniefpecft to their whale
;i)hery, it is to exorbitant premiums, the weak
iefs of our former government, and the (kill of
iaur citizens employed in their service, they owe
any material progress in procuring an article
so eflential in their confumptionânotwithftand
mg the utmost exertion of their pride during the
:ue war to conceal the faÂ»sl and hush their com
plaintsâand though by illicit traffic not a few oi
their goods were introduced among us, the dis
tresses of their manufacturers, owing to the warn
of a regular communication between the two
countries, were severely felt, nor will they wan
only consent to a funilar interruption.âSo large
a surplus of manufactures were on hand at the
commencement of the peace, that a fair face
and fine coat, formed fufficient credentials for a
jcredit of thousands of poundsâwhich proves,
rhat they had not during eight years found any
other market to fnpply the loss of our's. âBut
granting that their trade with us was of no ma
terial importance to her European dominions,
the moll sanguine will not draw the fame con
clufionsas it refpeifls their Weft-Indies and other
colonial poflfeflions in this country ; and it is a faift
which will meet the allent of their own citizens
inhabiting these places, that were it not for that
iraffic, carried on legally in their own bottoms,
with us, some contraband also, and the reft
through neutral ports, they could not subsist,
notwithftauding Lord Sheffield's imaginary
inundations of lumber, fifli, grain and other fup
plics from the Britilh provinces of . Canada and
>Jova-Scotiaâwhile the superior quality of Irish
beef and butter is no longer a counterbalance for
the difference of freight from that country or
thisâln proportion therefore as these different
channels of trade are rendered more difficult,
will the interest of the Weft-India planters be
urged in concert with oui exertions to effe<ft a
more liberal commerce between the two coun
tries. AM. ERICANUS.
ORIGINAL SPECIMENS of ELOQUENCE.
[Continued from our last.]
THE following Speech, remarkable for the concili
atory nature of the sentiments, and the noble simplicity
of the language, Wtis delivered by the Superintendant
of Indian affairs in the Southern Department, to the
Liiver Creeks, on the 2oth day of April, 1787. The
candid reader is called upon to determine, whether it
does not claim a preference over many of the Speeches
tranfmiud from antient times, admired by the critics,
and received as models for imitation in our American
Colleges. It is high time to learn to place a proper
value upon any thing which is realty meritorious in
itfelj; although it jhotild happen to have been produ
ced in our own age and country.
" Friends and Brothers !
" THE occasion that brings me here to fee you
is, I believe, partly of the fame nature, as that
for which you have met together. But before 1
enter upon the business, I cdnnot help exprefiing
the pleasure I feel atfeei.ig fomany of our parti
cular friends aflembled. The Lower Towns of
the Creek nation have always fliewn a modera
tion and a prudence, which 1 feel and admire. If
this disposition is continued it will eftablifli such
a friendfhip and commerce, as will be infinitely
better than quarreling and bloodshed.
" There are many present, who are already
informed that I am sent here by the great COUA
dIL, which in Peace and War diretfts the affairs
of all the thirteen United Nations oflVhiteMen ;
of whic i the Virginians, your neighbours, make
a very small part. I come From the center of their
government ; at a dijlance from here oj & whole
Moon's journey, on Jlrong Horses,
" Brothers!
" The Virginians of Georgia, who form one
of the thirteen fires of our great Council, com
plained at the Meeting last Autumn that their
Country was attacked and their People killed by
some bad men of theCreekNationâ They demand
ed assistance, if due fatisfadtion was not given a
gainst the offendersâBut the old and w.fe Meno*
the %reat Council, theCoNCRESs, before they
would fend out a strong army to assist in killing
heir brothers the Indians, with whom they had
ather be at peace, wished firft to enquire into
the matter, and fee if all things could not be a
micably fettledâFor this purpose they have sent
nieout.
<< Now Brothers !
" From Peace may we not all reap advantages ?

There can be none from (pilling each other's
blood.âThe Master of breath, lends us that
breath but for a little while ; why then should we
snatch it from one another soon I R than riE de
signs ? For this reason, 1 hope both parties will
be moderate.âPerhaps it hath been a little the
fault of both parties that any of the human blood
hatli been spilled oil the occasion.âl hope that
now each will yield a little to the other. When
our fiiends of the Creek Nation, who are now at
iugulta, come up, they will tell you how much I
inculcated this to the White People. I was hap
py to find them disposed to it ; except a few of
their mad young men, who are too apt to be dif
ipol'ed to war. But their nation will not be ri
gorous in their demands : they have presents in
(waiting for tlie l Â»Di ns, who I hope will go down
and receive the goods. lam convinced that this
}Nation will notinthe endlofeany thing, by coil' 1
firming the Grant of fucli lands as many of the
iefpectable men oftlie Nation have thought might'
foe spared; and have already grante-d :âwhich â¢
]gift it would be unmanly to retratfâif it could be
â doneâbut it cannot.
" Brothers !
" I have carefully avoided to mention any old
cause of quarrels, and I hope there will be none
for the future. You will find that the Head-
Men among the Virginians have lately made p o
vifion for severely punishing any of their bad
folks, who shall disturb their friends the Inaiatis.
" I will not trouble you further, but to mention
one thing, which concerns us all, and which I feel
from my heart : the red People and the /shite are
equally interested in it. We are Countrymen, we
live in the fame land; we breathe the fame air, we
Jhtuldbc brothers. The Kings and the People who
live over the great Water will wifli to subdue us
all. They will use cunning and force. Perhaps
at this vesy time there are men employed among
you to set you against us. It is not so long since,
but you mult remember how one-os these Powers
made visible efforts of this kind, even upon us, the
White J eople their Chii dren. But to tell you
what is done by others of rhem to People of your
colour, towards the midday fail, would fill you
with horror.
Ought we not, therefore, to grasp one another
with a strong arm of friendfhip ; the more easily
to repel these Foreigneis ? Go down then, and
receive the presents which are kept for you, aS
marks of friendfhip when you run the line ; as
you have agreed. You will be allu e I that every
care has been taken by the Virginians to prevent
your receiving any offence : as you, 1 flatter my
l'elf, will alfo'do by them. For my part, whenl
return from whence I came, I shall have tlieplea
fure to tell the great Council of Co ngre ss this :
then they, far from fending an army into the
Creek Nation, will exert themselves to give Trade
and the Comforts of life to you, and your Fa
milies. This will make the chain of ourfriend
ihip brighterâand, indeed, will be better for us
all.
" Before I make an end, I must inform you
that our friend Chewocleymicho and his compan
ions, the Iloflages, are in good health and spirits.
I have sent down to requelt they may be brought
up ; that it may not appear hard to keep our
friends too long from their relations. But I hope
the time pafles away agreeably with them : tor
when I left them, they had nothing to do but
to drink Rum, and be merry. If there is any just
cause of complaint, I now beg it may be made
known ; that I may use my belt endeavors to find
a remedy. All we have to request is, that you go
and receive your presents; and attend at running
the line, according to your agreement at the
Treaty."

ADDRESS TO HUMANITY.
PARENT of virtue, if thine ear,
Attend not now tomorrow's cry,
If now the pity ftreammg tear,
Should haply on thy cheek, be dry,
Indulge my votive strain, O ! sweet HUMANITY I
Come ever welcome to my breafl,
A tender, but a cheerful guest. â
Not always in the gloomy cell,
Of lift dwell;
For sorrow long indulged and flow,
Is to humunity a foe ;
And grief that makes the heart its prey,
Wears sensibility away.
Then comes, sweet Nymph, instead of t.W
The gli omy fiend Jlupidify.
Oh may that fiend be banifh'd far,
Tho' paflions hold eternal war .'
Nor ever let mcceafe to know,
The puife that throbs at joy or woe.
Nor let my vacant cheek be dry,
When sorrow fills a brother's eye :
Nor may the tear that frequent flows,
From private or from social woes,
E'er make this pleating fenfedeparx,
Ye cares, O ! harden not my heart!
Howe'er exalted or deprefs'd,
Be ever mine the feeling breast.
From me remove the stagnant mind,
Of languid indolence, reclin'd ;
Alike the foolilh and the vain,
Arc stagnant to the sense humane.
It comes : it fills my labouring breast ;â¢
I feel my beating heart oppreft.
Oh ! hear that lonely widow'.* wail!
See her dim eye ! her afpeft pale !
To Heaven she turns in deep despair.
Her infants wonder at her pray'r,
And mingling tears they know not why*
Lilt up their little bands and cry ;
Oh God ! their moving sorrows fee f
Support them sweet HUMANITY !
Life, fill'd with grief's diltrelslul traiu,
Forever a(ks the tjar humane.
Behold in yon unconscious grove*
The vi&im of ill-fated love !
Heard you that agonizing throe f
Sure this is not romantic woe !
The golden day of joy is o'er,
And now they part to meet no morie.
Alfirft them hearts ! from anguiih free!
Support them sweet HUMANITT!
II Heav'n in every pnrpofe wife,
The envied lot of wealth denies,
If doom'd to drag life's load*
Thro' poverty's uneven road;
To thee HUMANITY, still true,
I'll ivifh the good I cannot do,
And give the wretch that wanders by,
A soothing word a tear a fgh.
Parent of virtue, if thine ear,
Attend not now to for row'scry ;
If now the pity streaming tear,
Should haply on thy cheek be dry,.
Indulge my votive strain, 0 SWEET HUMANITY.

PARIS, MAY 7.
On Tuefd&y last about twelve o'clock at iioon,
his Majesty opened the Aftembly of the States Ge
neral, by a speech from the throne, which was
received with loud acclamations. The Â£)ueen
was seated near the King, 011 his left hand ; Alon
fieur, and the Comted'Artois, at a small distance
on the right ; Ms.dame, and Madame Elizabeth
(liis Majesty's fillers) with Mefdames Vicftour and
Adelaide (his Majesty's aunts) on the left hand
behind the Oueen. The other Princes of the
blood, with some Dukes and Peers, were also on
the.right ; the Marshals of France, with others
of the lame rank, were 011 the left ; the Garde
des Sceanx were also on the left, and th* other
great officers of state were on the right of the
throne. Ihe Due d'Orleans, who is the only
Prince of the blood chosen deputy to the States
General, took his feat as such amongst the nobili
ty. Ine Ministers were seated close under the
platform on which the throne was placed. As
Coon as his Majesty had fini(hed his speech, the
Garde desSceaux and Monsieur Necker addrefled
his Majesty and the aflbinbly ; and at about four
o clock in the afternoon the King rose from his
feat, and adjourned the meeting to the following
clay. .

members. This was done with a view to baffle
he pretensions of the Couimillions, who would
tain have all matters relative to the ftatesto be
decided, not as formerly by the plurality of or
ders, which would make but three votes, but bv
the majority of voices, which would produce as
many votes as the aflembly is <;oinpofed of mem
bers ; and in this cafe the third claf's would be al
ways sure of a great majority for, besides tha:

many partizans may be found, among tnefe ever
dilpofed to favor the views of the Tiers Etat.â
Many worthy redtors of parishes, most of whom
have been unanimously approved of by the peo
ple, are openly espousing the interest of the third
class, and express a nianifeft antipathy for all the
dignitaries, viz. Arclibifhops, Bishops, Abbots, and
their connections. The fame spirit may be said
to exist in the inferior nobility. This is the rea
son why the commons werefo earnest in soliciting
government to grant them a more equal represen
tation than they enjoyed in former aflemblies;
alledging, that as they actually constituted the
nation, and their number was, in proportion to
the other Orders, more than 24 to 1, the least they
could expe<fi was to form one half of tlie General
Aflembly. This claim seemed so just, that His Ma
jesty granted it, notwithflanding the contrary de
cision of the Notables, who had been previously
allembled to examine their claim, and who voted
by a great majority, in favor of the form ufedin
convening the last Aflembly of the States General
in 1614. 1 his was looked upon by everybody as
a real andfignal vitftory gained by the Commons,
nor was it in theleaft abated, butthatattheineet
ing of the States, every thing would be decidedby
the plurality of votes taken individually ; for it
would have been needless and illusory to increase
their number, if they were not to acquire an ad
ditional influence in the Aflembly ; and fuchmuft
certainly be the cafe if the fnfFrages are to be taken
collectively from the three Orders. Mr. Neckar
in his speech at the opening of the Aflembly,.
seemed inclined, to the great astonishment of the
public, to favour the latter mode of voting, and
although he palliated the matter, by faying, that
in some cases the former might be preferable,
such a doctrine was very much against his own
principles in the Kin *'s Council, here he openly
avowed a different opinion.
1 he above short paragraph will serve to explain
why the three clafles, or more propeily f'peaking,
the high ranks of the nobility and clergy are not
to agree, for it is they, who being extremely rich,
would be loth, in all probability, notwithllanding
their specious conxlefcenfions, to have an aJtpafs
that might expose them to pay ftridtly what they
ought.

MR. PRINTER, *,
I AM one of those who mind my owti business, and let the
World jog on as it pleases, provided. I fuffer no molestation from
it in my favorite mode of life : I am a friend to good government,
because I realize that there are some perfonsin my neighbourhood,
who do not know the extremes that the workings of envy at my
imaginary wealth, would lead them to, were they not restrained
by the laws. Having had considerable experience amoiig man
kind, and being convinced that Government is a very happy in
ventionâthat the security of my life, and all I poflefs,depends up
on its (lability and energy, I have had my quiet a liitle interrupt
ed of late, (which by the by is thercafon of my troubling you with
this writing),for I have heard some strange doctrines about magi
strates, and Governors, and Senators, and Representativesâit is said
by some, who I believe and hope do not underlland a word they
fay, that they are all going to be mixed up together and there is no
difliti&ions to be observedâand they are all a going to fit and
smoke togetherâandtotalk over mattersâand to make laws in the
very cheapest. and mod expeditious mannerâand are ail to have
the fame payâand wear the fume fort of coats, and to cut off all
their hair, but not to wear any wigsâand are to call one another
by their christian namesâand so to relieve the burdens of the peo
ple, by doing the public business in about a week, or fortnight, or
so : These will be glorious times my neighbor Tom Trotter
fays ; but I assure you, Mr. Printer, these things make me feel
plaguy foberâfor I vejy much doubt whether they will answer.
I am so faithlefs, that if an Angel was to come down from Heaven
and tell me that mankind were grown so wife, so moderate, so
just, so clever, and so every thing that's good, that they would all
be made happier by throwing every thing into a common flock,
my little all among the reft, I should look very (harp to fee whe
ther he had not a cloven foot, before I would believe him.
I tell some grumbling folksthat itis hardly so easy to make laws
in a chimney corner,as it is to fight battles there ; and that though
we in this country may be wiser than the reft of mankind in the
old countries, where the common people, as they are called, are
brought up in ignorance, that they, by long experience, have
found out some things of advantage to them, and among the reft
that they cannot live very happily without government âin which
some must rule, and others obey : I also inform them that some of
the greatest tyrants that ever lived used to coax and cajole the peo
ple in the firft place my paper is full, or I would write more.
Your's, Simon Doubtful.

W HERE is the man, whose blooming laurels shine,
A nd form a wreath his temples to entwine?

He rode victorious in the martial car :

To reach the goal, where Peace and Glory lay â

BOSTON, JULY 2?.
While the foil of America is propitious to the
produCtior. of genius, Europe appears no less pro
pitious to its growth and maturity. Poets, Paint
ers and Mechanic? seek in the old world those re
wards which cannot be bellowed 011 them in the

seem to have taken up their abode in those climes,
where the ingenious and benevolent Mrs. Wright
breathed her last. The inventor of the Quadrant,
Godfrey, though he loft the credit of the invention,
was there liandfomely rewardedâand within a
few weeks past, the indefatigable and ingenious
Pope,* the improver on the Planetarium or Or

London, in order, by observation or encourage

the country that encourages, and to the land in
which he was born.
â¢This Gentleman is one of those " hdittlti" but fclf-tsught
American Geniuses, who, maugre the wonderful difcovcries of cer
tain European philosophers, bid fail to carry the palm of know
ledge from all competitors, however fclf-magvificd, of the Eastern
hemisphere, Mr. Pope was bred to the Clock and Watch-mak
ing bufinefs âand although he had never seen the Orrery of our ce
lebrated RiTTSNHOi'SE, or any other machine of a similar kind,
he invented, conftru&ed, and complcatcd his PLANETARIUM,

Yesterday the Senate passed the Bill for the es
tablishment of the department of foreign affairs
with one very finall alteration refpetfting the chief
Clerk to the Secretaryâthe principle of the bill
is not varied.âThe question on the President's
power of removal from office was very warmly
debated,and in voting the members divided exact
ly even to and 10âThe President of the Senate
gave the calling vote in favour of the clause as it
came from the Hoaie, by which the power of the
President, to remove from oilice (as contained in
the Constitution) is recognizedâfor I consider the
aftas uothing more in this point thail a recognition
of a principle interwoven in the texture of the
system.âHeaven has been all gracious to America
in guiding this people to the choice of tlietr firit
andfecond magiftrlitesâ this determination of his
Excellency, is in perfect conformity tq, his senti
ments, nor do I think he would lacrifice them for
the Em pire of the world.
NEW-YORK, AUGUST i, 1789.
A government founded upon right principles, in order effec
tually to guard the rights of an enlightened people, Should be strong
in its conftru&ion, and energetic in its operation : Those amend
ments therefore which (hall have a'tendency to lefTen the force of
our National Government are to be deprecated.
The fubjeft of amendments to the Constitution is very delicate in
its nature, and dangerous in the experiment. So loug as it remains
as it is, the people will have a definite idea of the instrumentâand
it will be considered as the great Charter ot their privilegesâbut if
it should fuffer such alterations as will place the whole, or its vari
ous parts, in a conflruflive point of light, the benefit ol a Conflitu
tion will be loft. The much admired Britilh Conflitution is to be
found only in that infinity of precedents which are fcattercd throngH
an innumerable multitude of musty folios.
If history and experience did not fully explain the mystery, it
would be extremely difficult to account for that opposition which
some charaÂ£ters, in some of the States, make to neceflary official
Titles and DiftinÂ£lionsâfor these persons, from education, habit*
and natural difpolition, difcoverthat they possess the modfovereign
opinion of their own individual importance. To such oppofers of
the legal honors which the people are always disposed to confer up
on their civil rulers, may be applied the words of Dean Swi Ftâ
Their altitude ojfends tJie eyes
Of those who want the pow*r to rije.
Disinterested patriotism is a contradiction in termsâto this as
sertion the example of the Decli, and others, who facrificed their
lives for their country, may be opposedâbut it is well known that
the force of very inferior motives has (limulated men to such a
facrificeâvanity and vain glory have produced many very bril
liant actions. Wife legislators calculate their regulations of so
ciety upon quite different principlesâthey know that intercjl :s the
great objeÂ£t of mankindâhence they have always found it neces
sary to hold out inducements of various kinds, to flimulate to exer
tions, and to ensure obedience to the laws. Tnefe inducements
a*e requisite in proportion to the freedom which is emjoyedâin
arbitrary governments the feelings of the people are consulted, as
convenience may dictateâand their interest is always a secondary
Confederation âbut in a free republic, though there is every local*
general and personal consideration to influence, yet the people have
always found it neceflary to confer titles of honor and diftin&ion
on their civil Rulersâfor public offices, in proportion to
lity and freedom of the people, are never to be considered in a lu
crative point of view. And until human nature is d fferently con
flituted from what it now is, there must be a fubftitnte for pecuniary
rewards, to induce men to enter into the public serviceâmankind
have never yet devised any other than official diflinflions by hon
orary Titles.
The Boston Gazette of Monday last, printed by
B- Edes and Son, contains the following article :
" Our beloved Preside nt stands unmoved in the
" vortex of folly and dissipation, which the city

[A correspondent thinks it just to observe, that the reflefiion on
this city contain d in the above, conveys neither the fentimentsof
the inhabitants of Boston, or the people of MafTaciiufetts at large :
Of the great number of chara&ers from the Â£astern States, whom
a laudable curiosity has induced to vifil New-York, at th.s irjier
efling period, not a single complaint, refpeiting the " tolly and
" dilfipation" of the citizens, has ever been heardâand indeed it
is impofliblc that any person of the lead candor Ihould entertain
such an idea,for it would be contradiifrd by all their sensesâevery
appearance both in public and private, being in direst oppolition
to the infinuationof this para'graphift. j

of the legion under the command of Col. Wykoff,
âtheir corredl execution of dutyâtogether with
the orderly and refpe(ftable appearance and con

[Continued from our
NO controveiTy will be maintained with our
author, " that a free state is more excellent than
" simple monarchy, or Ample ariftocacy." But
the queition is, What is a free state It is plain
our author means a fiuÂ«[le aflembly of teprefen
tatives of the people, perioddiclially elecfted, and
vested with the supreme power. This is denied
to be a free ltate. It is at firft a government of
grandees, and will loon degenerate into a govern
ment of a junto or oligarchy of a few of the moll
eminent or them, or into an absolute monarchy of
one of them. The government of these grandees,
'while they are numerous, as well as when they
become few, will be so oppreflive to the people,
that the people, from hatred or fear of the gentle
men, will set up one of them to rule the reft, and
make him absolute. Will it be asked how this can
be proved ? It is proved, as has been often already
said. by the conlHtution of human nature, by the
experience of the world, and the concdrreut tes
timony of all history. The puilions and desires
of the majority of the representatives in aflembly
being in their nature insatiable and unlimited
by any thing within their own brtafts, and hav
ing nothing to controul them without, will crave
more and more indulgence, and, as they have the
power, they will have the gratification ; and Ned
ham's government will have 110 security for con
tinuing free, but the presumption of i'elf-denial
, and felf-government in the members of the as
sembly, virtues and qualitiesthat never exiftedin
gieatbodi'es of men, by the acknowledgment of
all the greatest judges of human nature, as well
as by his own, when he fays, that " temptations
" of honour and profit are fails to big for any
" human bulk." It would be as reasonable to
fay, that all government is altogether upneceflary,
because it is the duty of all men to deny tliem
felves, and obey the laws of nature, and the laws
of God. However clear the duty, we know it
will not be performed ; and therefore it is our
duty to enter into allociations, and compel one
another to do some of it.
It is agreed that the people are the best keep
ers of their own liberties, and the only keepers
who can be always trusted ; and therefore the peo
ple's fair, full,and honest confent,to every law,by
their reprefetatives, must be made an eflential part
of the constitution : but it is denied that they are
the best keepers, or any keepers at all, of their
own liberties, when they hold colleiftively, or by
representation, the executive andjudicial power,
or the whole and uncontrouled legislative ; on the
contrary, the experience of all ages has proved,
that they instantly give away their liberties into
the hands of grandees, or kings, idols of their
own creation. The management of the execu
tive andjudicial powers together always currtrots
them. and tlirows[the whole power into the hands
of the most profligate and abandoned among them
selves. The honelt men are generally nearly
equally divided in sentiment, and therefore the
vicious and unprincipled, by joining one party,
carry the majority ; and the vicious and unprin
cipled always follow the most profligate leader,
him who bribes the highest, and sets all decency
and shame at defiance : it becomes more profit
able, and reputable too, except with a very few,
to be a party man than a public spirited one.
It is agreed that " the end of all government
" is the good and ease of the people, in a secure
" enjoyment of their rights, without opprellion
but it must be remembered, that the rich are peo
ple as well as the poor ; that they have rights as
well as others ; that they have as clear and as sa
cred a right to their large property, as others have
to theirs which is smaller ; thatoppi eflion to them
is as possible, and as wicked, as to others ; that
Healing, robbing, cheating, are the fame crimes
and fins, whether committed against them or
others. The rich, therefore, ought to have an
effectual barrier in the constitution against bein<*
robbed, plundered, and murdered, as well as the
poor; and this can never be without an indepen
dent l'enate. The poor should have a bulwark
against the fame dangers and oppreflions ; and
this can never be without a house of representati
ves of the people. But neither the rich nor the
poor can be defended by their refpe<ftive guardi
ans ill the constitution, without an executive
power, veiled with a negative, equal to either, to
hold the balance even between them, and decide
vVhen they cannot agree. If it is aflced, When
will this negative be uled ? it may be answered,
Perhaps never : the known existence ofit will pre
vent all occasion to cxercife it ; but if it has not
a being, the want of it will be felt every day. If
it has not been used in England for a long time
past, it by no means follows that there have not
been occasions when it might have been employed
with propriety. But one thing is very certain,
that there have been many occasions when the con
stitution would have been overturned since the
Revolution, if the negative had nnt been an in
dubitable prerogative of the crown.
It is agreed that the people are " most sensible
" of their own burthens ; and being put into a
" capacity aiid freedom of acting, are the molt
" likely to provide remedies for their own relief. "
For this reafonthey are an eflential branch of the
legislature, and have a negative on ail laws, an
absolute controul over every grant of money, and
an unlimited right to accuse their enemies before
an impartial tribunal. Thus far they are moll sen
sible of their burthens, and are molt likely to pro
vide remedies. But it is affirmed, that they are
not only incapable of managing the executive
power, but would be inflantly corrupted by it in
such numbers, as would deitroy the integrity of
all elections. It is denied that the legillative
power can be wholly entrusted in their hands with
a moment's fafety : the poor and the vicious
tvonld inllantly rob the rich and virtuous, spread
their plunder in debauchery, or confer it upon
some idol, who would become the despot ; or, to
Tpeak more intelligibly, if not more accurately,
foine of the rich, by debauching the vicious to
their corrupt intereft,would plunder the virtuous,
and become more rich, until they acquired all the
property, or a balance of property and of power,
in their own hands, and domineered as defpotsin
fin oligarchy.

An ESSAY on FREE TRADE and FINANCES.
[Continued from Nd. XXX ]
WHEN fuigle persons or parties counteract
the laws, and disturb that peace and order of go
vernment which is established by general consent,
and in which there is a general persuasion that
the security of every individual is concerned,
there will be no difficulty in making such exam
ples of punishment, as lhall be fufficient to curb
those turbulent and factious spirits, more or less
of which may be found in every community, and
which would become intolerable if not kept
under a rigorous restraint. In all cases of this
fort, the righteous severities of government will
be approved, fupporred, and even applauded by
the general voice. Yea, if we were to fuppole
that the general opinion was wrong in any par
ticular matter of importance, yet it is plain, that
vicious opinion could not be confronted by foree ;
it mult continue rill the ill effects of it lhall pro
duce a general conviction of its error, or till the
people can be convinced by reason and argument
ot the danger of such an opinion, before the
ill consequences are actually felt, in both which
cases the people will turn about fact enough of
their own accord, and the error will be correct
ed molt effectually, and with ease, and without
any danger of disturbing the public tranquility.
Opinions indeed of a dangerous, hurtful nature,
may spread among the people, and when they be
come general, are to be considered as great pub
lic calamities, but admit of no remedy but that
which they carry with them, and which will
prove effectual in the end, viz. their own evil
tendency, and therefore muff be let alone, like
inundations, which however calamitous, whate
ver waite and deltrucftion they make, cannot be
controuled, any attempt to flop their force, en
creafes their violence and mifchief; tjiey dolealt
hurt when they are uninoleited, and are fuffered
to drain tliemfelves off in their own natural chan
nels : In short, there is no forcing every body,
and therefore I reject, with abhorrence, every
idea of governing a country by a {landing army, or
any other engines of force. I consider every plan
of this kind as a departure from the true prin
ciples ot government, as deltructive in its con
sequences, as absurd, and ineffectual to its own
ends ; for such a government, whenever it has
been tried, initead of promoting the peace, secu
rity and happinels of the state, has generally been
found to have operated by way of tyranny and
oppression.
It appears from all this, that the true art of go
vernment lies in good and full information of the
fuels to which its ordinances are to be accommo
dated, and in wisdom in adopting such institutions,
laws and plans of operation, as shall bell suit the
Hate and true interelt of the people, and
openly, fairly, and candidly with them. You may as
well attempt, by finefles, tocheat people intolio-
Wnefs and heaven, as into their real political in
terests. 1 here are people scattered over the
whole nation, who underitand the great interests
of the community and the wisdom of public mea
mres, and are as firmly attached to them as those
wno fit in the feat of government, and who are
always dilfatisfied ; and their confidence in the
public councils is lefloned, when they observe
public measures are adopted, which they do not
â¢ee the use of, and the ends for which they are
calculated, and of course little myfterv and few
iecrets are neceilary in government." Let the
admimflratxon be such as will bear examining;,
and the more it is examined the better it will
appear.
In such a mode of administration as this, if
burthens that are really heavy are necessary for
the public fafety, they will be chearfully taken
up and patiently borne by the peoDle without
endangering the public tranquility.

J<f freedom and love to their country, that early prin

the education which the youth of some of the ancient
republics received; and though we would by no meant
quote them as a general example for the enlightened
citizens of the American nation, yet in this particular
they are certainly worthy of imitation. I cannot
conclude this number so well in any other manner,
as in the words of His Excellency the Vice-President
of the li liited States in the third volume of his Defence
of the Conflitutions of the United Statesâhe sip,
1 he inftrucftioil of the people, in every kind
of knowledge that can be of use to them in the
practice of their moral duties, as men, citizens,
and Chriltians, and of ttieir political and civil
duties, as members of society and freemen,
ought to be the care of the public, and of all
who haveany fharc in the conduct of its affairs,
in a manner that never yet has been pra<ftifed
in any age or nation. The education here in
tended is not merely that of the children of the
rich and noble, but of every rank and class of
people, down to the lowest and the poorest.
It is not too much to fay, that schools for the
education of all should be placed at convenient
diftances,and maintained at the public expence.
The revenues of the state would be applied in
finitely better, more charitably, wifely, ufeful
ly, and therefore politically, in this way, than
even in maintaining the poor. This wouldbe
the bell way of preventing the existence of the
poor. If nations should ever be wife, inltead
of eretfting thousands of useless offices, oren
gaging in unmeaning wars, they will make a
fundamental maxim of this, that no human be
ing shall grow up in ignorance. In proportion
as this is done, tyranny will disappear, kings,
and nobles will be made to feel their equitable
equality with commoners, and commonerswill
fee their interest and duty torefpect the guar
dians of the laws ; for guardians they nwft
have as long as human nature endures. There
is no room to doubt that the schools, academics,
and univeriities, the stage, the press, the bar,
pulpit, and parliament, might all be improved
to better purpose than they have been in any
country for this great purpose. The emana
tions of error, folly, and vice, which proceed
from all these sources, might be leflened, and
those of v.'ifdom, virtue, and truth, might be in
creased ; more of decency and dignity niighj
be added to the human charadter in high and
low life ; manners would afliit the laws, and
the laws reform manners ; and iinpofture, to
perltiti'.n, knavery, and tyranny, he made
ashamed to show their heads before the wisdom
and integrity, decency and delicacy, of a ven
erable public opinion."
A SCRAP.
VICIOUS habits are so great a stain to human
nature, and so odious in themselves, that every
person actuated by right reason, would avoid them,
though he was lure they would always be coiicca
ed both from God and man, and had no future
punishment entailed upon them.
