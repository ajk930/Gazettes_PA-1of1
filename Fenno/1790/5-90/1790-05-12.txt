THE TABLET.
*' TV advantage of study is often loft, by attending 10 too many
points at once."
Mr. Editor,
t AM so well pleased with a letter lately sent
i me by an ingenious correspondent, that I
â wish it may be communicated to the public, as a
number of the TABLET. It is on\a fubjetfl of
importance, and I hope the remarks of my friend
â will meet with approbation, as they appear to be
founded in reason and propriety.
FOR THE TABLET.
" probably know that I was admitted to
-1 the bar of our Courts in April i 781 ; and
certainly know that for a confiderablepart of the
time since, I have given my attention to philology,
.belles Lettres and ancient hiltory. Some part of
the tihie has been spent in travelling, and this
has been the inoft ufeful period of my life. You
know from a multitude of observations, how ma
ny errors in opinion and deep-rooted prejudices
grow up with the most vigorous genius, under
the molt advantageous fyilem of book education;
unless the person has an opportunity oftravelling
abroad. 1 frankly own this was iny cafe ; and 1
was two years abroad, before I could believe o
taer States as wife, as prosperous, and as happy
as my native State.
" I have finifhed my ramblings and set downin
my profeflion, in a place as healthy as North
America affords, on a public road, in a pleasant
fertile country, where commerce is flourifliin<r,
manufactures begin to thrive, and the company
ks as good as I deserve. Here I have reflected up
on the errors of my own education, and endea
vored to devise a better plan ; being rayfelf con
fident that I might have gained all my present
knowledge and learning in half the time, had
my studies and travels been conducted by a man
of experience and juit ideas.
" I have found by experience what my tutors
tfhonld have caught me, that the great error in
â our common method ofinftru<fting youth, is, that
â we permit them to read "without an objeit; that is,
â¢without 3.fpictfic particular object. We give them
a book to read ; and diretft thein generally to be
mailers of the fubjeA. But the object, in this
cafe, is so general, so indeterminate, as to make
little or no.impression upon the mind of the ftu
;dent. It is not particular enough to arrest his
curiosity ; or rather the indefinite view of the
object renders it iinpoliible for the attention to
be fixed upon any particular point. The person
who reads avolume of Hiftdry, or-Law, with this
.general view, loses three fourths of his labor.
" Toreadtoadvantajje, the whole attention of
a fttident jhould be called to one point at a time.
Let liim be diredted for instance to enquire into
the reformation in the lixteenth century, and at
a future day, to inform liis inftru<ftor, at what
time this great event took place, and what were
the particular political, commercial or other acci
dental circumstances which favored the progress
of it ; by what characters it was effeCied, and as- -j
terwards what were jts corifequences on the po
litical itaie of Europe. Let him then be directed
â what authors to examine, and the more he con
fnhs, provided they are of reputation, the fairer
chance he stands of finding and retaining the
truth. The student then would fix his attention
upon one objeiil ; the faifts as they iliould arise
to view would reft upon the mind and gradually
form a connected ltory, and the prospect of reci
ting the faifts to the inftru<ftor would impress
them uiore deeply on the memory. Thus the
student Ihould take every important era, event
or person by itfelf and enquire into the accounts
â which different writers have given of it; and not
read a book in course, as is done for ainufeinent,
or by persons reviewing their studies.
" If I fliould ever open an office for ftudentsin
Law, I could wifli them to prepare for this libe
ral study, by a year or two year's preparation in
the study of History. The common practice of
keeping them two or three years writing on
No. CXIII.
rJ" j
parchment, I consider, as an impofuionj wnsea
fonable and useless. Tlit forms of process may
as well be learnc in fix months, as in a longer
time ; and a student of law should be fotnething
more than a drudge. If Undents were previously
acquainted with Greek and Latin, 1 fhonld wish
them to read Herodotus, Thucydides and Xen
ophonj in Greek, and Livy, Casfar and Tacitus,
in Latin. The belt orators arid poets among
the ancients are read as clafiical books in our
colleges and schools ; but their historians, which
I deem the inoft valuable, are moltly negledled.
This is one of the modern errors of our public
education. Indeed To imperfectly do mod of our
schools teach the ancient languages, that few
of the ftudenrs can read the Greek and Roman
historians witheafeand advantage. For thisrea
fon, I should diredt them to take the bell compi
lations of ancient history jn Englifli, and diredl
them to attend to such parts of it as illustrate
the policy, manners, arts and literature of the
wife and celebrated republics of antiquity ; for
as to wars, they are the dry bones ofhiftory, and
a hungry man will hardly fatisfy his appetite
by picking them.
" In (hort I could wish that the flndies ofybuth
might be made to approach to pra&ice. A Jludcr\t
of history should read it, like the compiler ; lie
should take a (Ingle point of history, and consult
different jruthorities until he had made himfelf
master of it. A student of Law should read it
like an attorney ; he should take one point and

Al/E pnfled on through several lefler rooms
into a large paflage on one fide of which
the Swiss (Mr. Wraxall's guide) opened a door
and through a narrow entrance, perfectly
he led me by a second door into an apartment or
dungeonâfor it rather merited the latter than
the former appellationâin the middle of which
Itood a cageâlt was composed of prodigious
wooden bars ; and the wicket which admitted in
to it was ten or twelve inches in tliicknefs. I
went into th'e inside ; the space it comprised was
about twelve feet square, or fourteen ; and it
might be nearly twenty in height. This was the
abode of many eminent virtims in former ages
whole names and mjferies are now obliterated
and forgotten.
" There was, said my conductor, towards the
latter end of the last century, a certain news
writer in Holland, who bad presumed to print
some very severe andfarcaftic reflections on Ma
dame de Maintenon, and Lewis the Fourteenth.
Some months after, he was induced, by a person
lent expressly for that purpose, to make a tour
into French slanders. I lie inffant he had quit
ted the Dutch teriitories, be was put under ar
rest, and immediately, by his Majesty's express
command, conducted to this place. They shut
him up in this cage. Here he lived upwards of
twenty-three years ; and here he expir
edâDuring the long nights of winter, no fire or
candle was allowed him. He was not permitted
to have any book. He saw no human face but
the gaoler, who came once every day to present
him, through a hole in the wicket, his little por
tion of bread and wine. No inflrument was given
him with which he could destroy hiinfelf ; but he
found means, at length, tn draw out a nail from
the wood, with which he cut out or engraved on
the bars of his cage, certain fleurs de' lis, and
armorial bearings,which formed his only employ
ment and recreation.
" It is now fifteen years, said the Swiss, since
a gentleman terminated his days in that cage ; it
was before I came to rcfirle here ; but there is
one instance within my own memory : Monf. de
F aperfonof rank, was conducted here by
command of the late King ; he remained three
yearsfliut up in this cage. 1 fed him myfelfevery
day ; but he was allowed books and candle to
divert his inifery ; at length the Abbot, touched
with his deplorable calamities, requeued and
obtained the royal pardon. He was set free and
is now alive in France.

it mult be determined by the event, whether the

It is very much to be doubted whether the

LET us now attempt a performance of the pro
mile, at the close of our firft number : Men,
in their primitive conditions, however savage,
were undoubtedly gregariousâand they continue
to be social, not only in every stage of civilization,
but in every poliible lunation in which they can
be placed. As nature intended them for society,
ihe has furnilhed them with pullions, appetites,
and propenlities, as well as a variety of faculties,
calculated both for their individual l enjoyment,
and to render them uletul to each other in their
social connexions. There is none among them
more eilential or remarkable, than the pajfion for
dijtinclion. A desire to be observed, considered,
esteemed, praifed,beloved,admired by his fellows,
is one of the earliest, as well as keenest difpofi
tions discovered in the heart of man. If any one
should doubt the existence of this propensity, let
him go and attentively observe the journeymen
and apprentices in the firft workihop, or the oars
men in a cockboatâa family, or a neighborhood
âthe inhabitants of an house, or the crew of a
Ihipâa school, or a collegeâa city, or a village
âa savage, or civilized peopleâan hospital, or a
churchâthe bar, or the exchangeâa camp, or a
court. Wherever men, women or children are
to be found, whether they be old or youngârich
or poorâhigh or lowâwife or foolilhâignorant
or learnedâevery individual is seen to be ftrong
]y aifluated by a desire to be seen, heard, talked
of, approved and respected by the people about
hiin, and within his knowledge. Moral wri
ters have, by immemorial usage, a right to make
a free use of the poets.
The love of praise, howe'er conceal'd by art,
Reigns more or Ids, and glows in every heart ;
The proud to gain it, toils on toils eudure,
The modest (bun it, but to make it sure.
O'er globes and scepters, now on thrones it fwclls,
Now, trims the midnight lamp in college-cells.
'Tis tory, whigâit plots, prays, preaches, pleads,
Harrangues in Senates, fqu ak.s in masquerades ;
It aids the dancer's hiel, the writer's head,
And heaps the plain with mountains ot the dead ;
Nor ends with life; but nods in fable plumes
Adorns our herfe, and flatters on our tombs.
A regard to the sentiments of mankind con
cerning him, and to their dispositions towards
him, every man feels within himfelf ; and if he
has reflected and try'd experiments, he has found,
that no exertion of his reasonâno effort of his
will, can wholly divert, hiin of it. In proportion
to our affedlion for the notice of others is our a
version to their neglect : The ftrongerthe desire
of the efteein of the public, the more powerful
the aversion to their disapprobationâthe more
exalted the wifli for admiration, the more invin
cible the abhorrence of contempt. Every man
jiot only delires the consideration of others, but
he frequently compares himfelf with others, his
friends or his enemies, and in proportion as he
exults when he perceives that he has more of it,
than they, he feels a keener affliction when he
fees that one or more of them, are more refpecfl
ed than himfelf.
This passion, while it isfiniply a desire to excel
another, by fair indultry in the search of truth,
and the practice of virtue, is properly called
emulation. When it aims at power, as a means of
diftinc r tion, it is ambition. When it is in a situa
tion to suggest the sentiments of fear and appre
hension, that another, who is now inferior, will
become superior, it is denominated jealovfy.â
When it is in a state of mortification, at the Su
periority of another, and desires to bring liini
down to our level, or to depress him below us,
it is properly called envy. When it deceives a
uian into a belief ofjfalfe profeffions of efteein
or admiration, or into a falfe opinion of his im
portance in the judgmentofthe world, it is vanity.
These observations alone would be Sufficient to
shew, that this propensity in all its branches is a
principal source of the virtues and vices, tlie hap
pinefs and misery of human lifeâand that the
history of mankind is little more than a simple
narration of its operations and effects.

HISTORY OF PENNSYLVANIA.
(IN CONTINUATION.)
THE manufactures of Pennsylvania have en
creafed exceedingly within a few years, as
well by mailer workmen and journeymen from
abroad, as by the encreafed skill and industry of
our own citizens. Houfliold or family manufac
tures have greatly advanced, and valuable acqui
fitionshave been made of implements and machi
nery to save labour, either imported, or invented
in the United States. The hand machines for
cardingand(ginning cotton, have been introduc
ed by foreigners, and improved upon ; but we
have lately obtained the water mill for {pinning
Cotton and a water mill for flax, which is appli
cable also to spinning hemp and wool. These ma
chines promise us an early eftabliflinient of the
cotton, linen and hempen branches, and niufl: be
of very great service in the woolen branches.
No. IV.
Additional employment for weavers, dyers,
bleachers, and other manufacturers must be the
consequence; Paper mills, gun-powder mills, steel
works, rolling and flitting mills, printing figured,
goods of paper, linen ana cotton, coach-making,
book-printing, and several other branches, are
wonderfully advanced, and every month seems
to extend our old manufactures, or to introduce
new ones.
The advancement of the agriculture of Penn
sylvania is the belt proof that can be given of the
comfort and happiness it affords to its farming,
manufacturing and trading citizens. In the year
1786 our exports of flour were 150,000 barrels
(exclusive of many other articles ;) in 1787 they
were 202,000 barrels ; in 1 788 they were 220,000
barrels ; and in 1 789 they were 369,000 barrels ;
which exceeds any export ever made in the times
of the province or in the limes of the common
wealth. The produ.e of flax is encreafed in a
much greater degree, and that of wool is consi
derably more than it was before the revolution.
A new article is likely to be added to the lift of
our productions, which is a well tasted and whole
some ft/gar,made from the Maple Tree. It has|been
proved by many fair and careful experiments,
that it is 111 the power of a substantial farmer,
that has a family about him, easily to make twelve
hundred weight of this sugar every season, with
out hiring any additional hands, or any ntenfils,
but those that are neceflary for his family and
farm use. The time in which it can be made is
from the middle of February to the end of March,
when farmers in this country have very little to
do, as it is too early to plough or dig. The price
of fngar being lower here than in Europe, this
ariicle may be reckoned at too Mexican dollars
per annum, to every careful and fkilful farmer,
that owns land bearing the sugar maple. Of tliefe
there are some millions of acres in Pennfylania,
and the adjacent states, and at least one or two
millions belonging to this state, for sale, upon
the terms mentioned in the preceding part of
this paper. It jfeems alf'o highly probable that
this valuable tree may be transplanted, and thus
be obtained by almost any farmer in the state,
and that men of property, who will purchase ket
tles and hire hands for the above short period,
may make larger quantities.
I he lituation of religion and religious rights
and liberty in Pennsylvania is a matter, that de
serves the attention of all sober and well disposed
people, who may have thoughts of this country.
This state always afforded an asylum to the per
fected feds of Europe. No church or society
ever was established here, notythes or tenths can
be demanded ; and though some regulations of
the crown of Englaud excluded two churches
from a fliare in our government in the times of
the province, that is now done away with regard
to every religious society whatever, except the
Hebrew church. But at this time a Convention
of special representatives of the citizens of Penn
sylvania have under consideration all the errors,
that have inadvertently crept into our constitu
tion and frame of government, and, in the act
they have published for the examination of the
people, they have rejected the half-way doctrine
of Toleration, and have eftabifhed, upon firm
and perfectly equal ground, all denominations of
religious men. By the provisions of the new
code, a Protestant, a Roman Catholic and a He
brew may elect or be elected to any office in the
state, and puifue any lawful calling, occupation
or profeflion. The constitution of general go
vernment of the United States also guarantees
this inestimable and sacred right, and it is surely
a sacred right ; for it belongs to the Deity to be
worshipped according to the free will and con
sciences of his creatures.
We lay 110 difficulty in the way of any person,
who desires to become a free and equal citizen!
On the day of his landing he may buy a farm, a
lioufe, merchandize, or raw materials ; he may
open a work-shop, a counting-house, an office, or
any other place of lawful business, and pursue his
calling without any hindrance from corporation
rules or monopolizing companies, or the payment
of any sum of money to the public. The right
of electing and being elected (which does not af
fect business 01* his fafety) is not granted till
the expiration of two years, which prudence re
quires.
