AN ADDRESS
TO THE CREDITORS OF THE US 7 IT ED STATES,
YOU are entitled to great refpefl*âlf you had not been our best
citizens, you would not have been our creditors, your pat-
Tiotifm made you such. When you performed services or lenc
your property, you nobly despised your immediate pcrfonal in
terests, or rather you looked beyond them. You law that if th
country was loft, you would have nothing to save. Is it in hu
man nature to perform this noble effort but once ? Is it the n tira
effect of felf interest to blind the eyes and to harden the h art ? o
jikc a dark lantern, does it throw a ftroug light upon what is near
while it involve* diftanr obje&s in a deeper thade ? Your patr
otifm has been proved hv your conduct: you are called, and ver*
juftlv, enlightened men ; how then can you be prevailed upon to
wifli that your own debt may be funded and that of the States ri
je&ed ? Their claims are as just as your Qwn. It is your intcrelt
to maintain a refpeft for justice, and to impress it upon the legif
laiure. Will vour own rights be-held inviolablr after tht ir fellov
rights are impaired in the ruin of the State creditors ? If the State*
can pay their own debts you lose nothing by throwing tliem into
the common (lock. If they cannot pay them, arc you neutral
fpeftators of their ruin ? Are you fafe while they fink ? When juf
ticeceafes to be a rule of public conduct, the shame which re
trains will be less, and the Temptation will be greater, which in
cites to destroy the domestic debt. If justice would not protefl
25 millions, will policy spare millions ?
If you regard humanity, the ruin of the State creditors ought to
move you. They will be-involved in dittrefs. The very money
that has been given to you has Idng been given to them ; it ha:>
grown familiar to their touch ; they gave up thr import which
was nearly equal to the pavmcnt of their interest in some of the
"States; 2nd now you aic told that the other funds occupied by the
State?, the last resource of their creditors, are to be d< strayed by
your laws, or greatly impaired bv your imposing on
the articles taxed \iy the States as much duties as they can bear.
If you believe that the duties intended to be imposed by Gongrefs
will be duly collefVrd, the difti ess of the State creditors is equa
ly manifeft and deplorable. As to their dependingon dire# tax
es <it is a mockery of their rights and of their injuries too. They
will not yield muck, nor that Tittle with certnrncy, while the ci
tizens, w any thing ner.r equal to the inter til of the -State debts
should be .levied, would fuffcr the 1710 ft violent opprcflion and be
driven from tlreir fnrms mto the wildcriiefl, while in other States
they would be almost free from burdens which to be just ought
to be equal. But experience has piovd, and thr woild knows
that some of theStstes cannot pay their debts ; you who claim jus
tice, should insist upon impartial justice.
But other motives arc not wanting even if yon-put ofT the poli -
tician and fay, let ns g<*t our dueâ-and let juftMce l<e <iee-med aic It,
âlet the government fall into conlufionâlet the country ftiffrr
disgrace and ruinâlet t-be brave officer or soldier who has fÂ«ivcd
it, keep his Sra'e paperâit is the proof of hi* merfts and of the
degree ;n which ws country oure cftremed thrniâlet him pine
and com pi tun m fee retâdo not mind the pulsations of your own

which come home to the fieiit and wound it. Yhey maHce the

the State creditors to be rxcludiÂ«d from jxroviliou by Congress ?
If tht funding system fo.mueh J cured, has been delayed, has
not tflis been owing to the drb.'te upon the afTu'inption ? IT the
system n fttll in danger m its paffape, i& tot this to be imputed to
the division created by this qucftion ? AJo not many members
think it a meafureof abfolure jufticcâthat norualjuoding i* work
than none at all 4 that positive injustice he flone if the reve
nues now occupicd by the Sates should "be i.npaircd ? If the af
'umption was once established, the funding system would be!
fpeediiy cnaficd. Nor do you lose anything in pi int of interest, |
tor it is not propefed to give vou an higher interest without the
atfumption than with it. Will you lu(e aa-y thin* tn point erf
fecuiiry in thccxcctiticn of the system ? the foci of the alTump
f ion allow that it will llrengthcn government ; can you doubt thjt ,
it will the collection of the duties more popular ? The St. t
crcditors will rot iu that cafe futfer by your meantâthey have the
'.'me interest with you, they will watch the revenues, nor will
the people approve of frauds which will wrong not only the pub
ic but their own friends and neighbors. It will diftufe common
niter efts and willies into everv corner ; you will have the whof
â¢ nnc.s under one energetic uniform system, and all inaereih ccm

at .cast one system would not injure the other. You will no
'hercfore lose by affirming the State debts.
See the oilier fide of Ilie piece, and judge whether you will be
if they fhonld not be assumed.

leed you in numbers and influence, will the state legillatures, be
obliged to recede and annul their laws ; or will they be unable to

SATURDAY, MAY iy, 1790,
If the article will bear both duties, why oppose the assumption'?
for it is plain that if a duty imposed by a (late is productive,
more money would be obtained by extruding it over the union.
If you will regard coufider.uions, equally weighty, tho a littje
moie remote, will you think a provihon permanent and late
which divides the government againll itfelf, which ferments while !
it is forming, vi:h the principle of deftruttion ? 'If a public dcot i

Aould be fafe to trull your felf interest to mpke its owji terms, Â»f'

to benevolence, the defireof reputation, in order
to make us good members of society. Speeiemur
agendo expre'les the great principle of activity
for the good of others. Nature has famftioned
the law of felf-prefervation by rewards and pun
i foments. The rewards of felfifh adtivity are
life and healthâthe punishments of negligence j
and indolence arc want, disease and death! Eath
individual it is true ihauld consider, that nature
has enjoined the fame law on his neighbor, and :
therefore a refpetft for the aiuhori.i y of nature
would oblige him to lefpedt the rights of others ;
as much as his own. But rcafoning as abstruse, I
tho as flmple as this, would not occur to all men. I
The fame nature therefore has impofod another
law, that of promoting the good, as well as ref
petting the rights of mankind, and hasfanclion
ed it by other rewards and punishments. The re
wards in this cafe, in this life, are etteem and ad
miration of othersâthe ipiinifoments are neglect
and contemptânor may any one imagine that
these are not as real as the others. The delire of
the eftceni of others is as real a want of nature as
hungerâand the negledt and contempt of the
world as severe a pain, ns the gout or (tone. Jt

which in its turn becomesa principal means of go
vernment. It is the only adequate instrument of
order and fuhordinarion in society, and alone
commands effectual obedience to laws, since with
out it neither human reason nor ftandingarmies,
would ever produce tliatgreat effedt. Every per

cherifoed in proportion to its capacity of gratify

that a nation has been interested in, and is in the

those names in the minds ofthe people, thatthev
are become national habits. National gratitude
descends from the father to the ion, and is often
ltionger to the latter than the former: It is often
excited by remorse, upon reflection on the ingra

been treated. When the names of a certain fam

by every body. A youth, a child of this extrac

his name is often a greater diftindtion, than a

TH E ingenious and elegant author of the
Tablet No. CXI. takes notice of the early
decay of our females, and hints that the impro
per dress used by them in the winter season is
one cause of that unfortunate fadl. It would
pleaf'e me to fee another number devoted to
the fubjetft ; but as he willies his hint to be
enlarged upon by others, 1 fear he will not a -
gain favor us with his reflections on this impor
tant head. My love to that amiable part of the
creation from whom my principal happiness is
derived (for I am a family man, ladies) makes
me take up the pen to point out to my fair coun
trywomen the fatal efFedts of adopting fafhions
only calculated for climatcs entirely different
from ours.
I have known a lady confined all day to the
house in winter weather,fcarcely protected from
the cold by handkerchiefs and shawls, yet when
the fun has withdrawn his heat and the coldness
of the air is nearly doubled, she drefles for foine
public place ; the handkerchief and ihawl are
thrown aside, a thin gauze supplies their place,
and the tender creature turns out exposed to an air
â which would make an icelander shiver. What is
the consequence ? A cough, which racks her for
the remainder of the winterâperhaps till death
lhatches her from a joyless existence.
Take warning by the pale shadows who crawl
along our streetsâremember, they are the vic
tims of fafhion. I like to fee a well drefled wo
manâl am pleased at feeing beauty solicitous to
please. But I would have the ornaments of win
ter differ from those of summer. I would have
iny countrywomen disdain to copy from any part
of the world.
Would it not move our laughter, or upon a
luppofition of insanity, our pity, to fee a person
in the midit of fuminer wrapped in the furs of
Ruflia ? and is it not equally absurd to fee on a
winter's day, a female array'd in the fafhions of
the south of Fiance ! Let ine conjure ye ladies
of America ! If you would wifli to pleal'eâif you
wish to be capable of being pleasedâis you wish
for health, or to be the happy mothers of healthy
children, accommodate yourdrefsto the changes
of our climate : do not for the hope of a mo
mentary admiration bring upon yourselves an
untimely old age, with all its pains, and without
any of its honors.
{We lately inserted an Extract from the speech of Mr.
Burke, in the Britijh House oj Commons. The
following are subsequent observations of other mem
htrs on that occajion.~\
MR. SHERIDAN warmly reprobated the
speech of Mr. Burke, which he said con
tained sentiments direcftly contrary to the princi
ples which he had hitherto profefled. He had
come forward as the advocate of despotism, and
had branded with the most severe epithets the ex
ertions of men struggling for their liberty. What
was that government, he would a(k, the down
fall of which his right honorable friend lament
ed ? It was founded on despotism, difgraceful to
human nature, and which had involved the coun
try in misery and ruin. In that aflembly, which
the right lion, gentleman had thought fit to ftig
matlze as a lawless, ferocious, and sanguinary
democracy, there were many men of very en
lightened minds, and they had already made
great progress in eftablilhing a constitution on the
ruins of that despotic fabric which they had de
moliftied, and which hetrufted would never again
rear its head. He admitted that particular in
stances ofcruelty and outrage had occurred,which
he lamented in common with every man ; and he
was afraid that the well known humanity of his
right hon. friend had, on that account, given
his mind a bias, which had prevented him from
perceiving the jofticeof that cause which gave li
berty and a free constitution to so great a number
of men. He could not help exprefling a consider
able degree of surprise to hear irom his lit. Hon.
LONDON.
Friend that this country had derived 110 advan
tages from the revolution in 1688, further than
a confirmation of antient rights. He had always
understood it in a difFerent point of view ; an
though lie had no objection to date the antiquity
of some of our moll: valuable privileges at a more
remote period, yet he concluded, that our Con
stitution at the Revolution acquired many im
portant and essential improvements, which it had
not beiore enjoyed.
Mr. Burke rose again, and claimed the indul
gence of the house for a few minutes. He ex
pected, lie said, that if the right hon. gentle
man who spoke hilt had not heard him with any
degree of partiality, that he would at least have
dated what had fallen from him with firinnefs and
candor. But he had grossly misrepresented every
argument he had urged. Every man who knew
him knew that he wastheprofefled enemy ofdef
potifm in every shape, whether it was, as he had
dated,the splendid despotism of Lewis XIV. orthe
outrageous democracy of the present govern
ment, which levelled all didinCtions of men.â
There were many persons in this country, he
was afraid, who entertained theories of govern
ment not very confident with the fafety of the
Hate. There were some he believed who were
ready to transfer that anarchy which prevailed in
France to this country, for the purpose of effec
tuating their own designs.
The right hon. gentleman had thought pro
per to accuse him of being the advocate of des
potism, and the libeller of the National Aflem
bly. He denied it. The whole tenor of his life,
he hoped, had proved, that though he was an e
neiny to licentiousness, he was a firm friend to
libertyâBut, said Mr. Burke, if the hon. gen
tleman and I are to leparate, he may find the fa
crificeofhis friend more than amply repaid by
the applause of the Clubs.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer warmly compli
mented Mr. Burke on his speech, which he laid
merited the gratitude of his country.
LONDON, March 16,
The National Aflembly have passed a decree,
abolishing all excluiive privileges for fending let

The King of Hungary set out from Florence on

he has given orders that he fliould not be received

From France, the accounts are favorable. The
municipality ofParis have agreed to advance nine
millions taking the product of certain convents
for their interest 'and securityâthus in a great
tneafure preventing, perhaps, a national bank
ruptcy.
The importation of tallow from America is ra
pidly encreafing, to the consequent decrcafe of
the importation of the fame article from Russia.
The change is particularly advantageous to this
country, as the Americans in return take more
of our manufactures than the Ruffians; the im
portation of American tallow ought therefore to
be encouraged in preference to Ruffian, though
every measure ought in policy to be taken by the
Legislature to decrease the importation of tallow,
by encreafing the consumption of oil, and there
by affording the greatell possible encouragement
to the British whale fifhery.
The Duke'of Tufcany is now in his 43d year,he

The fame of the late Mr. Howard, properly
diftinguifhedby the title of " The Philanthropic

that he seldom walked the streets without being
followed by a crowd of people, who paid him a
refpetl little ffiort of adoration.
When the above gentleman set out lad upon
his travels, instead of letters of credit, he carried
with him Bank-Nores ; and though, perhaps, such
a paper currency was never before seen in Cher
fon, where he died, such was the public depen
dence on his veracity, that theytookthem ascafli,
and as such they were circulated all about the
country on the niere credit of his name.
It is much to be regretted, that this amiable
man was taken off in theinidil; of his philanthro
pic investigation of the causes and cure of that
horrible difteinper, the plague. He had pro
posed to pass three years abroad ; to visit Grand
Cairo twice, to go to Constantinople : to those
Northern parts of Africa bounded by the Medi
terranean ; to fee the armies of the Turks, Ruf
fians and Imperialists ; and to publish the result
of his obfervatioris.

"JEWISH ANECDOTE.
In a Coffee-Houfe near Leadenhall-ftreet,where
the Prieftlean controversy became the topk of
converlation, an Israelite, whose lur|gs merely
were much too (trong for his antagonist, after
the former had retired, was pluming himfelf up
on his prowess in defeating him, &c. and with an
air of eclat alked another israelite if he had not
served the Philistine right! Molt certainly yon

PHILADELPHIA, May n.
A pathetic and elegant tragedy, called the
Widow of Ma la bar, written by Col. Humphreys
late aid dc camp to the Prefidejit of the United
States, was performed on Friday to ajudicious and
brilliant audience, with uncommon :n; rksofapprc
bation, whose repeated plaudits evinced the fatif
fa&ionthey received. The scenery was striking
and pitflurefque, (that of the funeral pile full of
majcjlic horror) and the drelles well chosen : The
performers exerted themselves in a particular
manner ; in short no piece that has appeared in the
western world has been received with louder
bursts of applause, and from the general avidity
exprefied by all ranks of people for its repetiti
on, there can be no doubt but it will be as largely
produtftive of profit to the theatre, as it has been
of fame to its amiable author.

(Tunc, " Return earaptur'J hours."
THE faireA flow'rets bring
In all their vernal bloom,
And let the tweets of spring
Adorn great FRANKLIN'S tomb
The patriot's toil is done,
At lenj;h hit labors cease,
Th' unlading crown is won.
His Sun, descends in peace.
The sons of Science grieve, *
1 he patriot heaves a figli
And scarcely will believe
That so much worth can die.
No deathless is that name
Which ages shall admire ;
Ant'. FranklinS fpltnd..'. tau,
Shall but with time expire.
While rap;d fly,
While awful thunders roll,
While meteors gild the flcy,
And dart from pole to pole.
Mankind shall A 11 adinire
When Franklin's name thry hear,
* " Who fnatch'd eeleftialfire,
" And broke the oppreflor's spear.
Through cv'ry future ace
While hift'ry holds a pen,
She'll rank our virtuous Sage
Amongst the firft of men ;
And when ihe counts her sons
Who've earn'd immortal fame,
Shall next to WASHINGTON'S
Record our Fk anklin's name.

on SundTay last with : visit from the ingenious Mr.
Fitch, accompanied oy several gentlemen of taste
and knowledge in mechanics, in a Steam-Boat,

accurate observations, they proceeded down the
river, at the rate of upwards of seven miles an

ful to recapitulate the various productions and

foundations of a grand scene of agricultureâthe

rials for a great variety of ufeful aud elegant

that no Euiopcctti uuttOH 'whQtJ'ocvei' unites in its
