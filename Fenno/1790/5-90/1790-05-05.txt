COPENHAGEN, 26 Dec. 1789
THE day before yesterday tlie Supreme Tribu
nal, whifh reviied the process of the confpi â¢
racy to burn the ftriUiaii and Daniili fleets in our
ports, pronounced definitejudgment,by which the
Sieur Benzelllierna is condemned to be beheaded.
His accomplices, O'Brien, and Shields, to public
labor for life. The only hope which at present
remains for the unfortunate Swiss officer, is in the
King's clemency.
ExtraCl of a Utter from Paris, 31 Dec.
The Marquis and Marchioness de Favras were
apprehended on the night of the 24th and 2Jth.
They wereaccufed of letting on foot a plot to af
faflinate M. Neckar, the Marquis de la Fayette,
and M. Bailly, to fill Paris with armed people,
carry off the King, See. On the morning of the
26th, Monfieui the King's brother, had an inter
view with the Marquis and M. ,Baillyâin confe
tjuence of which it is presumed, that he formed
the resolution of addreliing the Commons of Pa
ris in perfon,to refute the odious measures impu
ted to him. He was received by the Represen
tatives and the Saltefies with every mark of ap
plause, and placed in an armed chair on the left
fide of the Mayor.
M. Bailly answered his speech in terms expres
sive of the favorable ideas whichthe Commons ol
Paris entertained of the Brother of a King, who
was the Reflorer of French Liberty, complimented
him on his having shewn himfelf as the firlt citi
zenof the kingdom, byvotingfur the third estate
in thefecond Aflembly of the Notables. He con
cluded with offering him, in the name of the As
sembly, the tribute of refpeCi and acknowledg
ment which were due to his iciuimentsâthe ho
nor of his presence, and more particularly to the
value hefet on the esteem of Freemen.
M. Bailly's difconrfe was received with the
loudest acclamations, and a cry of No pardon .'No
pardon for tliofe who had accnfed him in so hei
nous a manner, as to aflociate his name with those
guilty people. Monsieur however exprefled his
desires to pursue lenient measures. M and Ma.
dam Favras have been committed prifonei s to the
Abby de St. Germain, as guilty of treason againjl
the nation.
Monsieur not fatisfied with juftifyiiiÂ£ linnfeU
before the commons of Paris, conceived the mat
ter of so serious a nature as to induce him to
write a letter to the national Aflembly on the fub
jeft, which was read on Monday 20th December,
afte'rwhich the Duke de Levis, proposed, that
the committe of enquiry of the national Aflembly
" should take immediate measures with those of
the city of Paris, to report as soon as possible
concerning the affairs of M. de Favras, and what
they may discover refperting the injurious libel
â¢against Monsieur." M. Alexander de Lamets
obl'erved on this motion, " that although Mon
sieur was the firfl citizen of the kingdom, like
other citizens he was fubjeift to the laws, that
the Aflembly ought not to order a particular
search warrant for a libel, in his favor, that this
matter ought to be referred to the proper tribu
nals, that the Chatelet having already taken
up the bulinefs, it ought to reft tlieie. M.
le Chapei.ier, and the Count de Mirabeau
ftmporting the fame principles, the Aflembly de
creed that there v>as no necejfity to deliberate on the
fubjefi.
Previous tothe difcuflion on Monsieur s letter,
the Aflembly after a long and animated debate
decreed, that the federal provincial States and
departments fliould deliver up iill accounts, pa
pers and proceedings relative to the administra
tion of the feveial departments, to the per ion 8
appointed to succeed them by the national Al
fembly.who are to invefligate all accounts for
the last ten years ; excepting tliofe of the trea
surers and receivers deceased, and alio such ac
counts as have been adjudged by the superior

ficulty " that in those provinces where the mu
nicipal officers poflefs the exercile of juris diction
in civil and litigntcd matters, they (hould continue
provisionally, the fame functions as heretofore,

CONGRESS.
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
WEDNESDAY, MARCH 31.
The proportion for affami'ig tie State debts under cmfideratiotl.
MR. SMITH (S. C.) replied to Mr. Williamfon, he said he
was not afraid of the assumption business loling ground by
a reconsideration. He was sorry tohear that North-Carolina would
be defrauded of half a million by the measure, but he believed
there was more probability of a fraud being committed, it no as
sumption was jo take place. Part of the gentleman's reasoning,
said Mr. Smith goes more in favor of the meafurs than againd it;
and the remainder of his arguments are not difficult to refute.
The gentleman has observed that it was imprudent to add to
the debt, which was already a large one, by the assumption ; that
the amount of the date debts was uncertain, and that a dooi'was
dill to be opened to encreafe them : It is not adding to a debt,
Mr. Smith said, to acknowledge those we owe, and we have al
ready resolved that Congress owes these debts which have been
improperly called date debts, because they were Incurred for ge
neral purposes ; it is not a wanton aÂ£t, but an honed avowal, that
these debts ought to be paid by the unionâtheir aflual amount is
immaterial if they are due. Has not the house declared they will
fund the domed'ic debt, and is that all liquidated ? There are
eighty millions of continental bills Hill unsettled, a man cannot
refufe paying a just debt because he is notacquainted with the pre
cise amount of all his debts; no door is opened to new claims
from individuals, but only a permifllon to the states to bring for J
ward tbeir claims, this will not encreafe the amount of the (late
debts, for they are already liqui<JÂ«ted by the several states, it will
only affect the final fettlemcnt between the states and the United
States. The fame member has said, that North-Carolina owes
to her citizens a large debt, amounting <o several millions which
she has assumed, and which Congress ought to pay, and he addu
cesthat as an argument against the assumption, when in fa& it is
the strongest reason he could have offered to shew its justice and
propriety; lor it would be the height of injustice to burden that
state with the payment of a large sum which (he does nAt owe ;
but if the measure is wrong, he would vote against it, although it
should be for the intercft of North-Carolina. In this the gentle
man was to be commended ; but the committee of the whole, af
ter fair difcuflion, had declared the measure to be right; if it was
right when that vote was taken, an adventitious circutnflance
could not make it wrong. Suppose North-Carolina had not ac
ceded, then the measure would have been declared a right one by
a decided majority ; its accession cannot make it a wrong one,
especially when it is so obvious that it will befor her mtereft.
We are cautioned against the imprudence of undertaking what
we cannot pay ; but either the state debts are to be paid, or they*
are not. If they are never to be paid, I give up the argument;
iftheyareto be paid, and that is admitted on all fides, then lam
clear it will be moreeafy for Congress to pay them than the dates*
it will require less money to be levied on the people. The resour
ces are the fame, whether they are paid by the one or the other;
but the collection will bÂ« moie simple and economical in the out
cafe than in the other. The only qucftion is, whether these re
fourcei (hall flow into the pockets of the creditors through one
channel or through thirteen. The Secretary of the Treafufy haÂ»
allured us he has ample funds for the purpose, and others in re- Â»
serve, without laying a land-tax; his calculations have been ques
tioned, but as he is a responsible officer, who has undoubtedly
contemplated the fubjefl with attention, and whose reputation is
in some measure pledged for the accuracy of his reports, I am in
clined to give credit to them, until I hear them refuted, from
his calculations it is evident, that the state debts may be funded
with the greatest ease by the union, ani with infinitely more ad
vantage to the people in general than by the several dates. To
prove our inability, we have been told, that the inhabitants of
France who reside in Paris, contribute each 64 livres annually,
and those who dwell in the country 19 livres, to the government.
Apply this to the citizcns of the United States, and what will be
ttiercfalC: Suppose 200,000 inhabitants dwelling in towns, pay
ing annually 64 livres, or fourteen dollars, this would furniflith6
sum of 2,800,000 dollars; And suppose 2,800,000 inhabitants re
siding in the country, paying nineteen livres, or three and an
half dollars, this would give 9,800,000 dollars, making together
the aggregate sum of 12,600,000 dollars; but the sum required
for the interest on the debt, including those of the several states
and the civil lift, is only 3,840,000 dollars, leaving a surplus re
venue of 8,760,000 dollars. Thus the instance which the gentle
man cites, to prove the inadequacy of our resources, has a direct
contrary effect, and if applicable contradi&s his own assertions.
It is said that the impost will be inadequate to the purpose, and
is uncertain, and that a poll and land tax, which may be collett
ed with greater certainty, are to be deprecated, because they
would be odious to the people. I adroit that if the state creditors
are excluded from the benefits of the impost, it will be ineffici
ent even to discharge the interest on the continental debt, because
the obftruttions which will be thrown in its way by the state le
gislatures in funding the state debts, and the facility which will
be given to smuggling by the injured state creditors, will conside
rably reduce the avails of the impost which may be laid for that
purpose ; but if the state creditors who are considerably more
numerous than the other class are included in the provision, they
will have an interest in supporting the due colle&ioe of the re
venue, and the general popularity of the impost will ensure its
operation. If the citizens of North-Carolina deprecate a dire&
tax, they will find their advantage in the aflfumption ; for if they
are left to fund their own debts, they must resort to dire6l taxes
they are deprived of the impost althogether ; little or no Revenue
can be drawn from a state cxcifer-they must therefore raise all
their supplies by a direfb tax. One orother of thefeconfequences
must therefore ensue ; either that state must distress her citizens an
nually byimpofmg an enormous direst tax payable in good money,
or she must defraud her creditors by paying them off in a depre
ciated paper. âThese are hard alternatives, but they are the in
evitable fconfequencea of a non-aflumption.
The member from that state has said that her citizens, though
numerous, are not wealthy. This is another reason, in my judge
ment, why the aflumption would be advantageous to them ; for
citizens who are not wealthy, contribute less to the revenue by
impost than by direst taxes. A poor man pays as much by a poll
tax as a rice man ; but each individual pays by an impost only in
[Whole No. in.]proportion to his riches. He contends, however; that a direst
lax, though jt would be obnoxious to the people, if coUe&ed by
continental authority, would be acccptable, it" levied by the au
thority of the states. When we advert to the funding fyftcms of
the several slates, we shall find them less beneficial to the people
than is imagined. The mode of issuing certificates for interest,
jnd calling them in by a dircft tax, is injurous both to the credi
tors and to the other citiaens. The creditor is heaviiy taxqd in
order to pay himfelf ; money is taken from him in the fir ft instance
10 pay him the interest on his debt; the poorer part of the com- 4
rt)unity who are Unprovided with these certificates delay purcha
sing them till they are prefled for their taxes, and then they are
iupplicd at an enhanced rate by an accommodating fpcculator, or
a friendly colle&or, who had previously bought them up for the
puipofe; the creditor receives no benefit, the public derive no
.advantage, the citizens are heavily taxed, and the fpcculatois get
all the profit.
The conftar.t fln&uation in their schemes of finance is another
diftrcfling circumstance to the citizens In one feflion those who
have purchased public property for which they are to pay in state
paper, and which it becomcs their interest to depreciate, gain the
ascendancy and carry mealures produ6live of that effect. In the
next, the holders of the state oaper preponderate, and in their
turn procure a system which will appreciate the paper. Thus the
people are embarrassed and diftrelled by these speculations and
contentions.
The numerous tax collectors in the different states is another
cause of expcnce and inconvenience to the citizens. A direst tax
in every state would require, under state regulations,
collc&ors, all of whom mull be paid by the people for their trou
ble. There is another consequence reciting from direÂ£t taxes of
a very fcrious nature -Individuals pre too apt to neglect making
provision for their taxes in due fcafon; executions are iffaed a
Â£atnft them,their property is levied upon and they have ultimatrly
to pay poundage and constable fees, which sometimes amount to
inore than the tax itfelf. All these grievances are remove dby re
sorting to the import, and that species of revenue will alone be
nearly competent to provide for the state debts, if aflumed by the
union. Even (hould Congress resort to dircdt taxation 'and lome
members from the fouthcrn states have exprefTed a predilettion
for it) there is no doubt that it would be levied in a mode adapt
ed to the particular habits and convenience of every state ; for by
the constitution it is not required that taxes, like duties and excise
Ihould be uniform; and as each ftete has its particular reprcfenta
tion in this house, it is evident that the accommodation of the dif
ferent parts of the union would be confultcd : It would also be
levied with more economy under one system than under thirteen.
The ceflion which the state of North-Carolina has made to the
United States is said to contain a provision which is opposed to the
aflumption : the provision referred to only relates to the final ad
justment of the accounts between the individual states; for it re
quires that in such adjustment the lands ceded,and the inhabitants
belonging thereto, shall not be estimated in ascertaining the pro
portion of North-Caroliua with the other states in the common
expence occanoned by the war.
An amendment proposed by that state to the constitution has
also been expatiated on, as manifefting her aversion to this mca
fure; it is rather extraordinary that this conftru&ion should be
given to the amendment, when the house have been told that the
idea of an aflumption was never contemplated in that slate; indeed
it was improbable the citizens of that country should endeavor to
guard against a measure, the bare portability of which had never
occurred to them. An attentive examination of that amendment
will prove that it evinces no such intention as has been attributed
to it; as it relates expressly to all the states, it could not have had
North-Carolina exclusively in view, nor was it dcfigned to guard
against any interference with her state paper alone ; As it parti
cularly relates to an interference by Congress or the judiciary, it
an apprehension of some interference by the federal courts,
which eould not be involved in a question of aflumption ; it is
therefore evident that the true interpretation of that amendment
is that the convention of that state were apprchcnfive of some in
terpolation of the judicial courts of the United States, in enforcing
payment of her state Cecurities. That it docs not relate to the
question of aflumption is clear, hecaufe were it calculated to pre
vent an aflumption, it would have said so in explicit terms, and
declared that Congress should not pay her state debts; and because
the genxleman from that state has informed the committee that
they never dreamt of an aff'iinption. North-Carolina, is unwil
ling that Congress should dittate to her how fhc should discharge
her debt, but it does not appear that (he has any objection to Con
gress afluming and paying it themfelvcs.
Admit however the full force of the remark, and it would tend
to restrain Congress from funding even the continental and fo
reign-debt without the a (Tent oftwo thirds of the members pre
sent in both hojjfes; for another amendment from that state re
quires that no navigation law, or law regulating comuicrce should
pass except in the above mode; and the funding fyftcm cannot go
into operation without Inch laws. The gentleman however woirJd
have no objeÂ£lion; he fays, tr the assumption, provided security
could be given that there woul d be a settlement of ihc accounts
of the fcveraJ states, but there is no such proviso in the amend
ment ; if it has in view theailumpuon, it is opposed t<s it under
â¢auy modification whatfocver. How can he then reconcile his
Jlate to a vote gi\ en in contradiction to their express sentiments,
merely becaufethc buflne.s would be put in a shape which is pa
'iutable to hiinfelt, is no t this another proof that the amendment
did not relate to th "ifiumption ?
Another local objc&ion is started from that state : It is said
that she has i(Tued paper money with winch (he has bought up
an 4 paid ofF certificates, and which paper money she mull lay
taxes to redeem, and if Congress do not alFume lhat paper, as pait
of her debt, she will be under the neceflity of paying taxes to link
it, and at the fame time of contributing her proportion ot reve
nue for the debts of other states, and that this would be defraud
ing her of half a million of dollars, the amount ot the paper to
emitted. If that state has funk a part of her debt, Congress will
have less to aflume on her account in proportion to the sum dis
charged* there will be consequently a tmaller charge against her
in the ultimate settlement, and she will become a creditor state in
the fame proportion; if therefore the has bought in her own cer
tificates under par, or paid them ofF with paper in a depreciated
state, she has bten a gainer by the negotiation, and is ui a better
condition than those states which have not had this advantage :
The revenue she will contribute willte applied as well to the
payment of her own debts as those of other states, which will also
contribute their proportion to the payment of her debts. But no
mcafures, it is said, arc in forwardnefs for the completion of this
settlement. CommitTioners of accounts have been engaged a con
siderable tiny: 111 this business, and are now pursuing it.with the
aflfiftance of a numerous body of clerks, and are in a train of set
tlement. Should other measures be thought requisite to expedite
and ciifure the adjuftinent, Congress may accompany the afTump
tion with a bill making special and effeÂ£lu3l provision for that ob
je&. Noith-Carolina it is laid, is apprehensive least some fecui i
ties of that state which were fraudulently iirued ftiould be funded
by the union, and charged to her account; how will they be charg
ed to her account if there is to be no settlement of the accounts,
and the member from that state <ays he is persuaded there is to be
none ? She will then receive the benefit of those fccuritics,.and the
citizens of the other states will pay her the intcreft on them ; if
they are fold to speculators, at all events Hie or her citizens have
received a consideration for them : But either that state will be
able to deteftthe fraud, or she will not; if (he can discover the
f'iud, so can Congress; they wi*' therelorebe rejected, and there
is no ground of appre'henfion ; it Â».he fraud is not liable to dete&i
---o i, their at any rate North-Carolina must pav them; ii*afmuth
therefore as it is for her interest that they should be paid by Con
gress rather than by hcrfelf, this circumstance is rather an argu
ment in Sgvor oi the ail-umption*
THE TABLET
V Not for him felf he fees, or Hear/,
" Artists mud chirfc mufjc, meats."
THE taste of the world is regulated by very
few persons. This may seem the more
strange, as few people approve ot the fafhions
they are compelled to follow. It is not easy to
account for it, that in a land of freedom where
men are leftj in most refpetfts, to pursue what
their inclination didlates, to many persons thould
lead a life totally the reverse ot what they with.
Amanfeems, as it were, to give up his natural in
dependence of temper, the mojnent he begins to
live in falhion. Henever can consult hiscoveni
ence, and not often the particular call ot his fan
cy, in the choice of his food or apparel. The pri
vilege of chofing for one's felf is surrendered by
every one, who would be supposed tathionable.
A man of finilhed taste mult feldoin eat what he
likes, or wear what is convenient for him. As no
great harm results from this kind of felf denial,
in a general way, it is not my intention to com
plain of it. There is however some regard to be
paid to reason and nature, in the regulation of
our diets. Though taste cannot be managed by
any rules which admit of demonstration, there is
nevertheless, in some things, a natural propriety
which ought not to be overlooked.
Forinltance, drefslhould be accommodated to
the season and climate. The laws offafhion can
never control the conllitution of our bodies in
such a manner, that the people of a cold climate
can,without real impropriety,borrow their modes
of drels, from the inhabitants of a warmer one.
French falhions may be, in themselves, superior
to thole of any other nation, but they illy apply
to the lituation of the Northern parts of the Uni
ted Srates. The furrs of Rnffia are much better
adapted to our winters, than the silks of France.
It is not a matter of consequence in point of ex
pence, what country we imitate in our dress, be
cause it we are industrious, we can afford to wear
what we please. But when we conliderhow the
health is affected, it becomes an affair of serious
moment, to whom we look for direction in form
ing our taste. It would discover more reul good
sense to form our ownâbut as this would be trou
blesome, I do not expect we shall ever be so inde
pendent. Foreigners remark that the ladies of
.America lol'e their bloom, and impair their viva
city at a very early period of life. I am of the
opinion that the irregularity of our climate is the
principal cause of this unfortunare fad:. Perhaps
this is a misfortune againll whi h there is no per
fect remedy. The effctfts of it, however, may be
partly counteracted, and our women may preserve
their health and vivacity much longer than they
do. There isnodoubt, thata warmerdrefs in the
Winter,than is usually worn by our females, would
meliorate their Conllitution, and contribute to
their happineis. These few hjnts, I hope will be
enlarged upon, by fomeperlbn of leisure and re
flection.

MR. FEX.N'O,
A PARAGRAPH under the New-York head,
published in your Gazette of this day, has
these words, " In this age of refinement, when
even tyrants are taught moderation, and Haves
their rights, I am surprised that the attempt to
repeal the British (religious) Tell Laws, has not
fucceedcd." In the next sentence, it is said that
Mr. Pitt, and by an inference the British Legisla
ture, treats the claim of.an equality of rights as
an extravagant delusion of the mind." And then
the question is alked, "Is there a village in A
merica, where this dodtrine of Mr. Pitt's would
be approved !"
Was the writerto learn thatthereare not only
villages in America where this dodtrine of Mr.
Pitt's would be approvedâbut that it is a funda
mental principle in the government of Six of the
Twelve United States. I allude to those States
which have clauses in their. Constitutions to the
following effectâThat no per/onjhall be eligible to a
feat in the Lcgijlaturc,utile ft he be of the P* oTes ta nt
Religion. Ido not by this remark intend to sup
port the decision of the British parliament, I la

WHEN one family is deprefled, either in a
Monarchy, or in any species of republic,
another ni uft arise. While, in the reign of Fr an-
Cis Ift. they thus humbled the branch of the Boui
llons ; there arose two other powerful families,
who soon obtained the administration of affairs :
The house of Montmorency, and that ot Guise ;
bolh, indeed inferior to the Blood Royal ; but
both illultrious by the l'plendor ot the most an
cient nobility. That of Montmorency produces
Titles, which prove its descent, by an uninter
rupted fuccefiion, from one of the principal Gran
dees who accompanied Pharamovd in his firft
expedition. It has the glory of having been the |
lirft French house which received baptism and the
Christian Faith. The memory of this diftinttion
is preserved in the motto of their arms, Cod help
the firJl Chrijiian Baron ; a splendid testimony both
of the antiquity and religion of their ancestors.
Anne of Montmorency, who united a vast genius,
directed by prudence, to a grave and imposing de
portment âwho combined a lingular address to a
patience never to be exliaufted in the intrigues
and affairs of the Court, which change so often
their afpeift, sprung from this stock. His high
qualities merited the confidence of Francis lit.
After having palled thro all the military grada
tions of the State, he was at firft elevated to the
dignity of Grand Master of the King's house hold,
and after the death of the Duke of Bourbon, to
that of Conjlableâ in one word he concentered
in his person, the command of armies, and the
principal administration of all the affairs, civil
and political, of the kingdom.
The house of Lorrain, of which that ot Guise
is a branch, derives it ofriginal, from the highest
antiquity. It reckons among its paternal ancef
tors, Godfrey of Bouillon, the famous leader
of the Crusades, who by his valour and piety
conquered the kingdom of Jerusalem ; and by the
female line it traces its descent from a daughter
of Charlemain. Anthony, ot Lorrain, chief of
this rich and powerful family, reigned over his
people, with an absolute authority ; Claud, his
lounger brother, went into France to take pof
fellion of the Dutchy ot Guise, and there recom
mended himfelf by his valour.âAfter the battle
of Marignan, where he commanded the Ger
man troops, he was taken out from an heap of
dead bodies covered over with blood and wounds;
his cure was thought to be a miracle, and he held
afterwards the firft rank among the greatest cap
tains of France. The houses of Guise and Mont
morency, had rendered services of such impor
tance to the State that it was difficult to deter
mine, which of the two merited the pre-emi
nence In the splendor of their birth and the
extent of their domains, the Guises had the ad
vantage. In the favor of the King, the family
of the Constable was most advanced, and saw lt
felf at the head of affairs. Nature which has es
tablished in the univeile a chain of being, and
universal order, defending from Arch Angels to
microscopic animalcules, has ordained that no
two obiects shall be perfectly alike and no two
creatures perfectly equal. Although among men,
all are fubjec r t by nature to equal la-ws ot morality,
and in society have a right to equal ktwsfyr their
government, yet no two men are perfectly equa
hi oerfon, property, understanding, activity and
virtueâor ever can be made so by any power
less than that which created them ; and when
ever it becomes disputable between two individu
als or families which is the superior, a ferment
ation commences, which disturbs the order of all
things until it is fettled and each one knows his
place in the opinion of the public The quef
tln-i of superiority between the Guises audMont
morencys had theulual effects of such doubts. But
as nothing is less liable than the for tune of cour
tiers, in ill-ordered governments they both expe
rienced reverses, towards the end of the reign ot
Francis the Ift. That jealoufy,which never has
an end because it is always well founded, which
reiens in every government, where every pafhon
and every interest has not its correspondent
counterpoise, actuated the King. The two mi.i
ifters not being fubjeft to any regular plan of
responsibility, were become dangerous rivals of
their master ; their enemies knew how to infin
ite suspicions. The Constable fell into disgrace
for having perfuadecl the King to trust the pro
mi fes of Chari.es the Vtli. and to grant him a
free paflage through France, as he went tochaf
tife the rebellion of Ghent. The Emperor not
kceuinshis engagements, the King and the court
accnfedthe Constable of having failed, either in
prudence or fidelity He vyas obliged to leave
the court and return to private life, to conceal
himfelf fvom the purluits of his enemies. _ The
Duke of Guise was also constrained to quit the
court and give way to the storm, for having in
curred the displeasure of the King, by caufmg
be raised upon the frontiers without his con
tent certain troops, which he sent to the Duke
of Lorrain, his brother at that time ?X war with
the Anahaptifts.
The Conltable, and tne uuÂ« """'V. S |
disgraced, were replaced by two ministers of con
summate experience, indefatigable uiduftry an
acknowledged abilities ; the Admiral D Anne
baut and the Cardinal de Tournon. The me
diocrity of their fortune and extraction, excited
little apprehension, that they would ever arrive,
at that high power, of which the King had rea
son to be jealous, and which he dreaded in the
hands of his fubjetts. This Prince, who under
flood mankind, and was become unquiet and lul
picious since his disgraces, had long resolved to
dismiss from his person, the Conltable and the ]
Duke, notwithstanding the long confidence with
which he had honored them ; believing that he
fliould not be able to govern, according to his
| own mind, while he Ihould have about him two
persons, whose credit and reputation were capa
ble of balancing his will. He dreaded in the
Constable that profound experience and that
lively penetration, from which he could not con
ceal his mod hidden secrets. Every thing was to
him suspicious in the Guises. Their llluftrious
birth, their restless humour, their active genius,
that ardent character to embrace every occahon
to aggrandize themselves, and that ambition ca
pable of forming projedts the n\olt vast and dat
ing. As the judicial courts had no independence,
and there was no regular judicature for impeach
ments, there could be no rational responsibility.
The King could inflict none but arbitrary pun
ifliments ; there was 110 tribunal, but the States
general and their committees, and among thele
the ministers had as many friends as the King.
The ministers therefore thought themselves, and
as the constitution then stood they really were,
so nearly equal to the King in power, that they
might do as they pleased with impunity. 1 hey
presumed too far, and the King was jullly offend
ed : but had 110 remedy, but in the aflailination
or difuiiifitiii of his ministersâhe chole the latter ;
though in the sequel we (hall fee many instances
ill flniilar cases, of the former ; in the last years
of his life this monarch, if we may call by that
name a Prince who|was in effect,nothing more than
the fir ft individual in a miserable oligarchy, se
cretly recommended to Prince Henry his son, to
tliftrnft the exceflive power of his fubjecfts, and
especially of the house of Guise, whose elevation
would infallibly disturb the repose of the king
dom. Francis now saw and felt, thatthe house
of Guise was become, as the house of Bourbon
had been before, a dangerous rival of the house
of Valois.
Ambition, disappointed and disgraced by a King,
commonly becomes obsequious to the heir appa
rent, or ostensible facceflqr. In 1547, Henry the
second, the successor of Francis the fiift, disre
garding the advice and example of his father,
difmiiled from his court and service, the Admi
ral and Cardinal, though possessed of the secrets
of the state ; and placed again at the head of af
fairs, the Constable Anne of Montmorency, and
Francis of Lorrain, son of Claud Duke of Guise,
who soon engaged the confidence of the yoGng
King, and regulated every thing at his court.
Their authority was equal: But, as has been once
observed, nature has decreed, that aperfett equa
lity Jhctli uever long exijl between any two mortals.
TWe views, the conduit and the cliara>fiers of
the two iniiiTfters, were unlike in all things.
The Constable advanced in years, was naturally
fond of peace : Formed by a long experience in
th<* art of government, h6 enjoyed an high repu
tation for wisdom, and held the firft place in the
condu<fl of affairs of state. The Duke, in the
flower of his age, captivated by an elevated ge -
nius and sprightly wit, united with arobuftcon
ftitution and a noble figure, the affe&ions of the
King. Henry treated him, almost as his equal;
admitted him to his converfatioiis, his pleasures,
and tliofe exercises of the body which were sui
table to his age and inclination. His affedtion for
the Constable, was rather veneration : His attach
ment to the Duke was familiarity. The conduift
of the two favourites was very different; the one
an enemy of all show, urged with a certain seve
rity, from which age is seldom exempted, tliene
ceflity of economy. He even opposed the profu
fion of the Prince. His austere virtue infpireda
contempt for foreigners, and rendered him lit
tle f'olicitous for the affetflion of the French. The
Duke of Guise affable and popular, gained by his
liberalities and politeness, the hearts of the peo
ple and the soldiers. With a generous warmth,
he protected the unfortunate, and conciliated the
esteem of strangers.
Inclinations and condutS: so opposite, soon pro
duced jealousies, between the two ministers, e
qually beloved of the King. To insinuate them
selves further into the royal graces, and make
themselves matters ofhis favors, they exerted all
their skill, address and efforts. Their emulation
and ambition were stimulated by their nearest re
lations, and private friends. The Constable was
irritated by his NephewGafpard de Coligni, Lord
of Cliatillon, who had succeeded to the Admi
ral D* Annebaut, and who was not less distin
guished for his policy, than eminent for valor.
The Duke of Guise was animated, by the Cardi
nal Charles of Lorrain, his brother, who united
444
the splendor of tlie Roman purple, to a r.ablt
figure, profound erudition and uncommon elo
quence. . . ,
Hence forward the daemon of rivalry, haunted
the twohoufes of Guile and Montmorency : and
fortune did not fail to open a valt caieer, to the
animated emulation of the two competitors.

MR. HOWARD'I DEATH.
What the friends of humanity, and the ad
mirers of unexampled benevolence have often
and anxiously predicted, has at last occurred
the amiable and virtuous Howard has fallen a
vidtim to his persevering and unrivalled philan
tliropy. The excellent man paid the debt of
nature on the 20th of January, at Clierfon, after
an illness of twelve days.âHis disorder wasavio
lent fever caught at the hospital at that place,
where he had been adminiltering medicine to
many poor wretches who languilhed under tk
fame malady.
Thus fell a man who was not only an ornament
to his country but to human nature. 1 lie name
of Howard has long been held high in the annals
of England ; but the philanthropic Howard, has
extended the fame of the Britilh virtue overall
the globe ; and the dreariest nbodes of misery
and disease have echoed with the praises of him,
whose greatelt delight was, " in going about to
DO GOOD."
