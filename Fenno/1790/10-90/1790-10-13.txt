[A Dclcnce of the Conftitptions rÂ»f Government of the Jjn'fjd

OUR the opinjpp
rvKCOT, '' a(li;ml)lv oFreprelen
/jÃhfV&sVhoulftUe chosen by t!v< jjatton, and vert
ed with all the powers of government; and tliat
this aflembly, being the centre in which all au
thority is collected, (hall be virtually deemed the
r.ation." To llate the conferences, and expose
the absurdity of this opinion, Mr. Adams takes a
scries, but comprehensive view of all those conn
tries in Europe 111 which the government may be
called republican ; and from uiis survey, denion
ftrates the necessity of different orders in a ilate,
and of an equilibrium between thein. His reflec
tions in the tweury-third letter are enlightened,
spirited, and manly :
44 As we hftvc taken a cur Cory view of those countries in Europe'
where the government may be called, m any reafonabJe Â«onltruc
tion of the word, republican, Jet us now paufc a few moments,
and rtflett upon what we have seen.
" Among every people, and in every species of republics, we
Juvc constantly found a firft magiftrStc, a head ; a chief, under
various denominations, indeed, and with different degrees of au
thority, with the title of ftadtholdcr, burgomaster, avover, doge,
confalloniero, president, fyndick, mayor, alcade, capitaneo, go
vcrnor, or king ; in every nation wc have met with a diftinguilh
ea officer : it there is no example in any free government any
more ihan in those which are not free, of a society without a prin
cipal personage, we may fairly conclude that the body politic can
not subsist without one any more than the animal body without a
head. If M. Turgoi had made any discovery which had escaped
the penetration of all the legislators and philosophers who had
lived before him, he ought at least to have communicated it to
the world for their improvement; but as he has never hinted a:
any such invention, we may fafely conclude that he had none ;
and therefore, that the Americans are not jifftly liable to cenfure
for instituting governors.
" In every form of government we have fecn a senate, or little
council; a ion generally of those offucrs of state who
have the most experience and power, and a few other members
felc&ed from the highest ranks and most illustrious reputations.
On these letter councils, with the full magiitrate at their head,
generally rcfts the p.iÂ»*ctj*d iwrrfcn o*', adn .liftrutiun, a ftrare hi
tlw le?iflaii\e as welf as executive and i<.r .ual authority qt go
vernment* The admiUion of such senates to a participation ol
thef? three kinds of power has been generally observed to produce:
in the minds of their members an ardent ariftocratical ambition,
grasping equally at the prerogatives of the firft magiftiate, and
she privileges of the people, and ending in the nobility of a few
families, and a tyrannical oligarchy : but in those States where
the senates have been dcKarrcd from all executive power, and
confined to the legislative, thfy haw- been oblervcd to be firm bar
riers against the encroachments of the crown, and often greai fup
portersof the liberties of the people. The Americans then, who
have carefully confined their senates to the legislative power, have
done wifely in adopting them.
44 \Vc have fecn, in every instance, another and a larger aflcm
bly, coiÃpo'ed of the body of the p Â»ple, in some liule States ;
of representatives r holen by people in others; of members ap
pointed by the senates, and funpofed to reptefent the people, in
ti thud fo*t; and of persons appointed by themfelvca or the sen
ate, in certain arillocracies, to prevent them from becoming oli
garchies. The Americans tbpn, whole. afTcmbliis are the most
adequate, proportional, and equitable representations of the peo
ple that are known in the world, will not be thought erroneous
in appointing houses of reprcfcntativcs.
44 In every republic, in the fma I left and most popular, in the
larger and more afttiftocratical, as well as in the largest and most
monarchical, we have observed a multitude of curious and ingen
ious inventions to balance, in their turn, all those powers, to
check the passions peculiarto them, and to control them from ruffl
ing into those exorbitances to which they are most addiÂ£led ; the
Americans will rhen be no longer cenluicd for endeavoring to in
troduce au equilibrium, which is much more profoundly medita
ted, and much more cffc&ual for the protection of the laws, thaii
any wc have fecn, except in England ; we may tven question,
whether that is an exception.
44 Id every cpuntry wc have found a variety of orders, with
*ery great diftinclions. In America there arc different orders of
oifices, but none of men ; out of offi :call men arc of the fame
/pecies, and of one blood ; there is neither a greater nor a lelfjr
nobility. . Why then are they accused of establishing different or
ders ot men ? To our inexpreflible mortification we mufl. havt
remarked that the people have preserved a Ihare of power, or an
cxiftencir in the government, in no country out of Kngland, ex
cept upon the tops of a few inacctflible mountain.*, among rock.',
and precipices, in territories so narrow that you may span them
wish an band's hrcadth ; where, living un nvied, in extreme po
verty, chiefly upon pailurÂ»ge, destitute of manufaÂ£lures and com
merce, the> ft ii exhibit the moll charming pi&iire of life, and th
Â»noft dignified chara&er of human nature. .
44 "Wherever we .have fcca a territory somewhat larger, aits and
sciences more cultivated, commerce flouriftiing, or even agriculture
improved to any great degree, an aristocracy has risen up in a
rnurfe of time, confiding of a lew rich and honorable families,
.who have united with each.other against both the people and th
inagÂ»ftratc; wrested from the former, by art and bv force, a 1!
ibtir participation in the government, and even infpircd them
with \q me.in an rftcem of t.hcmfelves, and so deep a veneration
and strong attachment to their rulers, as to believe and contefi
ihein a superior oider ot beings.
44 We have fecn these noble families, although neceifitated to
have a head, extremely jeaUpus of his influence, anxious to reduci
jiis power, and constrain him to as neai a level with themfeivefi
ps pofliblc, alwajs endeatforiug to eflablifla a rotation, by which
tlicy may allequaily in turn be entitled to the pre-eminence-, and
equally anxious to prefei ve to thcmlelvcs as large a lhaic of pow
rr as pofiibJcin ibe executive .<nd jwdiaitij, as well *s the
department* of f-be stair.
WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 13, 1790.
1 hefe patrician fatnilieshave alio appeared, iri every inflance,
to be equally jealous ot each OLher, and to have contrived, by
blending lot and choice, by mixing various bodks in tlie elections
to flic* lame offices, and even by tht; horrors of an inquisition, to
guard againfl the fin that so eafilv besets them, of being wholly
influenced and governed by a junto or oligarchy of a few among
themselves.
" V* e have fern no one government in which is a diftinÂ£l repar
ation of the lcgiHitivc from the executive power, and of the judi
cal from both, or in yjurh any 2ttc.,ipt been made to balance
intfe powers w'nh one another, or > form an equilibrium be
tween the one, the lew, and the majj' lor the purpose of enaÂ£l ; ng
and executing equal laws, by common consent, lor the general
mtereft, excepting in .England.
11 Shall we conclude, from these melancholy observations, that
human nature is incapable of liberty ; that no hon<-(l equality can
be preserved in society ; and that such forcible causes arc always ai
work as mufl reduce all men to a fubmillion to despotism, monar
chy, oligarchy, or artftocracy f
44 By no m ans, âWe have seen one of the firft nations in Eu
rope, poffeued of ample and fertile territories home, and exten
live dominions abroad, of a commerce with the whole world,
immense wealth, and the greatest naval power which ever belon
ged to any nation, who have still preserved the power of the peo
ple, by the equilibrium ware contending for, by the triai by
jury, and by couilantly refufing a (landing army. The people of
England alone, by prefcrving their fnarc iri the legislature, at th
â ex pence of the blood of heroes and patriots, have enabl d iheii
kings to curb the nobility, without giving him a (landing army.
44 After all, let us compare every Constitution we have 1c en wit!i
those of the United States of America, . id we fliall have no rea
son to blufti lor our country ; on the coutrary, we (ball feel tii
llrongcft motives to fall upon our knees in gratitude to heaven,
for having beep graciouflv plea fed to give us birth and edulat.ou
in that country, and tor having defined us to live under her laws !
We (hall have rrafon to < xult, il we make our comparison with
England and the JKnglilb conUitution. Our people arc undoubt
edly lovere:gn ; all the landed and otherjpropcrty is in the haud.>
ol the citizens; not only their reprefemuives, but their senators
and governor*, are annually chosen ; theicf arc no hereditary tide ,
honours,offices, or diltmtlions ; the leg:flative, executive, and ju
dicial powers are carefully separated from each other ; the pow
ers of the on-, the few, and the many, are nicely balanced in their
legislatures ; trials by jury are preterved jn all their glory, and
there is no Handing army ; the harbeas corpus is in full force ; the
press is the mo ft free in the world ; and, where all these circum
stances take place, it is unnectfTary to add, that tire laws alone can
govern.
In the subsequent letters Mr. Adams contem-
with a critical and philosophic eye, the
jnoft celebrated states and common wealths of an
tiquity, Carthage, Athens, Crete .Corinth,
Ai ga&, riic'iÂ»c!>, Crotona, Sybaris, Locris, and
Komc ; and at the fame time delivers the opin
ions of the celebrated ancient and modem writers
concerning the principles of government in ge
neral, ami i liefe governments in particular. The
result of his researches is favorable to that divi
iiÂ°n of power which the English and the Ameri
cans have adopted, and which appears to reft up
on the authority, the experience, and the wildoin
of ages.
In the poftfeript, Mr. Adams favors the public
with the copy ot a letter which he lent to the
Abbe de Mably when he declared his intention of
writingoti the American revolution. The adven
turous lpi. itof the French literati is well known ;
who, trusting to the vcrfatility of their talents,
which is often great, and to the correct elegance
of their language, which is universally read, pre-
I'ume to write on all l'ubjecfts, foreign and domes
tic, human and divine, on a very (lender acquain
tance. Our author's requelt to the Abbe to write
upon American alfairs was a piecc of nicer civil
ity, and, as he informs us, " rather a defirethat
he would not expofc hivifelf, by attempting a his
tory that he was altogether unprovided foi*, than
any formal reqoeft that he Ihould write at all.
\V'e are obliged," continues Mr. Adams, " to any
gentleman in Europe who favors us with his
thoughts ; but, in general, the theory of govern
ment is as well understood in America as it is in
Europe; and by great numbers of individuals is
every thing, relating to a free conltiturion, infi
nitely better comprehended than by the Abbe de
Mably, or M. Turgor, amiable, learned, and in
genious as tliev were."
O _ J
The preface to this work contains many excel,
lent anil manly sentiments, worthy of an ancient
Greek or Roman. The following obfenratidns,
which iorin a panegyric on the Englilh as well ais
American constitution, will serve as a specimen Â£
4i It is become a kind ot falhion among writers to admit, as a
maxim, that, if you could be always sure of a wife, a&ive, and vir
tuous Prince, monarchy would be the bed of governments. But
tnis is so far from being admiflible, that it will forever remain
true that a free government has a great advantage over a fimplc
monarchy. The bed and wisest Prince, by means of a freer com
munication with the people, and the greater opportunities to col
-1 Â£1 tbe be ft advice from the b eft of his fubje&s, would have an
immense advantage in a free state more than in a monarchy. A
lenate CQnfifting of all that if most nobK, wealthy, and able in th<
nation, with aright to counsel the crown at all times, is a check to
ministers, and a security againlk abates, that a body of nobles who
never meet, and have no such light, can never aceomplifh. Ano
.ner aflembly, compofcd r;f reprcfentaiive*, chosen by the people
11 all paru, gives the whole nation freeaccefs, and communicate*
'I the wants, knowledge, projects, and wilhet of the nation, to
government; rxcitc? an emulation among all claflfes, remove* com-
625
p aints, rcdr>'flVs grievances, aflords opp of exertion to
genius, though in ohfeuritv, ?nd gives full scope to all ine fa. ultu s
of iv.zn ; opens a palfagefor every fpecuhtiooto tlie Jcg:Qature, to.
admiinllration, and to the public ; ll gives an univetfai energy io
the human charaÂ£ler, in every part ol the flaie, which'never can be
obtained in a monarchy. â¢
<k There is a third particular which deserves attention both from
governments aÂ»d people. The minillers of fUte, i-i a fun pie m>-
n.irchv, can never know their friends from their enemies ; cab is
in kcrc't undermine their influence, and blast their reputations.
This oceafions a jealousy ever anxious and irritated, which never
ihinks-the government fafe without an encouragement of inforrt
crs and spies, throughout everv part of the Hate, who interrr H the
tranquility ot private life, destroy the confidence of families in
their own domestics and one another, and poison freedom irÂ» iis
fwecteil retirements. In a free government, on the contrary, the
mir.ifter s can have no enemies ofconfcquence but among the mem
bers ol the great or little council, where every man-is obliged to
t.:kc his fide, and declare his opinion upon everv question. This
circumstance alone, to every manly mind, would be fufficienr to
decide the preference in favor of a free government. Even secre
cy, where the executive is en l ire in one hand, i is cafily and fureJy
prtferv.d in a free government as in a ftmple monarchy; and as
to difpatcb, ail the limple monarchies of the whole un:verft rr.ny
be defied to produce greater or more examples of it than arc t$ be
found in Englilh hiflory."

Franklin " the firfl fruits of America." The
American revolution has given elalticitv and en
ergy torhe minds of the inhabitants, lias called

ing, an acutenefs of re.'leilion, and a masculine
spirit, which few amballadors in any court of
turope poflefs, but which all of them \votild be

" Your committee having taken into their mod
.fctious consideration the requisition front the
Court of Spain, demanding a categorical an(\ver,
touching our engagements, in consequence of the
Family Compa&, have the honor to fubmitto the
wisdom of the National AfTembly, whether- a
flriift compliance with the said requisition would
nor be rilking too much under the present circum-
Hances of the kingdom, more especially the Ma
ture of the question being materially altered since
the preliminary declarations between England
and Spain, subsequent to the date of our deliber
ation on this point, affording us theple&fingprof
pert ofa speedy and amicable accommodation
between the two powers ; nevertheless, fhauld
your best endeavours towards a happy termina
tion fail, we hold ourselves bound in honour to
fapport our ancient ally,in every such right and
claim as you lhall deem reasonable and jnft."
Theladmeflengerto Madrid had orders to (lay
for the answer from the Spanish Court ten days,
and no longer. On the expiration of the ninth
dÂ«y, Mr. Fitzherbert lent notice to Count Flori
da Blanca that the meflenger would certainly quit
Madrid on the ensuing day. This occafioued an
immediate interview, and produced the declara
tions. It is evident from this, that the Spaniard
only consulted the convenience of the momentâ
only did it to prolong timeâthat he did it with
great relutftariceâand will wipe away the dis
charge with a war, if France can be brought to
alfift him. '

THE Queen-inothci and the Guifcs, delayed no longer the
opening of'the States. They l>. gan by the protcffion of
faith, drawn up by the Sol bonne, conformably to the do&nnes of
the Ruman Catholic Chuich. The Cardinal de Tournon, Prefi
dentof the order of the Clergy, read it with a loud voice, and
each of the deputies appiovcu ond adhered to it, upon oath , a
precaution which they judged neccffary to assure thcmfelves of the
catholicity of thole who were to have a deliberative voice, in the
general assembly. Alter this solemn a&, the Chancellor proposed,
in the pretence of the King, the matters which were to be taken
into consideration. At the instance of the, Provinces, the three orders
Jeparated, to examine the f effective demands, and make report oj their
rejtsluluns. But all this was merely theatrical : it was nothing
but farcical scenery. The Guiles knew, as well as the Contlable
Â«ie Montmorency, that the mioillry could govern the kingdom,
and nation at its will, as a Court or Supreme Executive alwayi
will, where it is checked pnly by a (ingle reprefetnative assembly,
cfpccially if that assembly have no authority but to advise.. Nay,
if it have Legislative authority, the majority in that assembly can
only govern, by impofiog its own men on the Executive, in other
-words, by forcing the King, to take their creatures into the minis
try. So chat the minillry and the majority in the National Assem
bly must always atl in concert, and be agreed ; and they general
ly arc so, to the intolerable oppreflion of the minority, as 111
this cafe. Reformition of government, and liberty of conscience,
and redress of grievances in religion, were fubjefb which the
court had too much cunning to biing before the Assembly. That
â¢would have, been, as the Constable expressed it,-to have prepared
a formidable opposition to themselves. Had the point been then
fettled, that the Sates were a Legislative affeinbly ; and had the
ijueftion of religion been brought fairly into deliberation and dis
cussion before them, it is very probable that liberty of conscience
to the Hugonots, might have been the result, even in that age.â
But these, as Davila fays, were the smallest objects they had in
view : all minds expcSed with much more solicitude, the iffueof
the detention of the Prince of Condi. Their doubts were soon
Telolved by a declaration of council signed by the King, the Chan
cellor and all the grandees, except the Guifec, who,as fufpefted of
partiality, atfcfled not to appear in this affair. Acommiffion was
eflablifhed for the trial of the Prince, with authority to render a
definitive fentencc. De Thou, prelidcnt, and Faye and Viole,
counsellors of the Parliament of Paris, were the' Judgesâ Bourdin,
Attorncy.Geucral, Tillot, Secretary: All the interrogations and
acts weru done in the pretence of the Chancellor L'Hopital They
heard the depositions of the prifouers of Amboifc, Lyons and
others. They made preparations to interrogate the Prince. He
refufed to answer, alledging that in quality of Prince ot the blo6d,
he acknowledged no other tribunal, than the Parliament of Paris.
He demanded an assembly of all the chambers of Parliament ;
that the King should be prcient in pn l'on, and that the twelve
Peers (hould have a voice,as well as the great officers of the crown,
according to the ancient usage. That he could not excuse himfdf,
for not. remonstrating ajainft a proceeding so unheard of, and ir
regular, and stum appealing to the King. This appeal was carri
ed to council, and appeared authorized by reason, by the ordina
ry formalities, and by the cuftoins ol the kingdom. But rhe spi
rit of rivalry, which is the spirit of party, demanded a sudden
vengcance : a party at present triumphant, but doubtful whether
it were at bottom the inotl powerful, were impelled by fear, as
well as hatred, to with a prompt dccitiun. The appeal was de
clared null. But the Prince, having renewed it, and persisting in
his protestations, the council, at the motion of lh- Attorney-Ge
neral, pronounccd that they ?ught to conlider the Prince as con
victed, fmce he refufed to answer to commissioners named by the
King. In this manner they obliged him to submit to interroga
tories, and purfucd the trial, without loss of time, to final judj-
menf,
The Princes oT Bourbon, at the summit of misfortune, wrre ve- ]
ry near expiating with their blood, the heinous crime of daring
in competition with the Guises, to patronize liberty of
confcience,and to (heller Irom p rfecution the diftrrffed Hugonots :
as Manlius was precipitated from the Tarpeian Rock, for being
the friend of the opprellcd debtors, and the Hval of Camillus and
theQuintian family. Both wereaccufed, it is true, with crimes
against the state. The l'plendor of the birth of the two Bourbons,
and their personal merit, inrercftcd all France. Even their ene
mies pitied their dcltiny. The Gu'.fcs alone, naturally enterpriz
ing, pursued constantly their designs, without regard to the merit
or quality of thofc Princes, whether they judged such an ast of fc
vci ity absolutely neccifdi y, to the lafety and tranquility of the
kingdom, or whether, as their enemies iuppofed, th y had no
thing in view but the deflru&ion of their rivals, and the ,*(bbliih
mcnt of their own grandeur. They declared openly, that it was
necefTdi yby two fti okes, at the fame time,to flrike off the heads of
Heresy and Rebellion. Such is thefpint of fophijlry : and such is
the spirit of party. The Queen-mother, although she confcnted fe
cretlv, and wilhed that the resolution taken at Amboife, of dc
ftroying the Princes, (hould be executed, defned nevertheless, that
' all the odiuin of it fhoitld fall upon th. Guiles, as (he had always
had the address, to accomplish. She proposed to manage the two
parties, for tear of those unforefeen events, which the inconstancy
of fortune might produce ; and .-tfedted much grief and melan
cho'ly in hef behaviour, and reserve in her discourse. She had
even frequent conferences with the two Ciiatillons, the Admiral
and Cardinal, in which (he appeared disposed to seek some expe
dient, to extricate from danger the Princes of the blood. She
amused in the fame manner, the Dutchefs of Montoenfier, a Prin
ce fl full of the best inreutions, an enemy of all diliimulation, and
who judged of i he chara&ers of others by the re&itudc of her own.
â Her inclination to Calvinism, and her intimate connexions with
the King of Navarre,Â»had enabled her to commence and continue
between that Prince and the Queen, a secret correfpondefrce.
These intrigues, although oppofice to the condu& which
the court held in public, were palliated with so much artifice,that
the most could not unravel their genuine deli m,even
when thev reflettcd on the depths of the secrets ofinankind, and
the diversity ot interests and pailions which serve as motives to
their aÂ£hons.
Already the comraiflirmers had rendered their judgment against
the Prih'cc of Conde. They had condemned him, as convi&ed
of high treason and rebellion, to be beheaded, before the palace
of the King, at the hour of the aflem bly of the States General.
They delayed the execution, only to draw into the fame {dare
the Con liable; who, in fpight of the repeated inftanccs of the
court, still delayed his journey to the States. They wished to
involve in the fame prolcriprion the King of Navarre, but they
had not proofs agaiuft him, fufficient to fatisfy their own crcaturcs
when one morning the King, in drefling himfelf, fell all at once
into a swoon, so deep and violent, that his officers believed him
to be dead. He recovered his senses, it is true : but his malady
was judged to be mortal, and his life was despaired off This fa
tal mischance terrified the Guiles. They pressed the Oueen mo
ther, to execute the sentence against the Prince of Conde, while
the breath remained in the bodv of the King, and to take the fame
resolution against the Kino; of Navarre, to prevent :>ll the revolu
tions which they might have to fear, in cafe of the King's death.
They represented to her, with warmth, that this was the sole
means of prelcrving the crown to her other infant children, and
of diflipaling the storm which menaced France : that, although
the Couftablc was uot arretted, and ia the present dclicau cTr
cumftaiioeÂ«, it would not be prudent to seize hint, yet >\hen
they (hould have no longer tp fear, neither the credit, nor the
prctenfions of the Princes of the blood, the ConlUble would be
less formidable, as he would neither have the nobility in his ln
terells nor the Hugonots of his party : that to deliberate in the
moment of execution, and fulpend it in this critical lituation o
the King, would be to lose thelruitof so many projefls cm.-
du3ed to their end, with so much artifice and patience : that
even the death of the King ought not to be an obstacle, becaule
that b.others succeeding him of right, the fame reasons and the
fume intcrefts dill fubfilUd, both for them and their mother.
The Queen who had known'how topieferve herielf neuter, at
least in appearance, and who had not motives so urgent to pre
cipitatcmcalures, confidcred th.it under a minority, Kings might
change their afpeft, and that the excLflive grandeur of the Guiles
remaining without opposition, might become to her as forimda
ble as the ambition of the Princes of the blood. Thus lome
times by supposing the distemper ol the King to be leis d.mgei Â°" s '
sometimes by spreading favorable reports of a Ipeedy cure, lhe
gained time, delayed the execution of the Prince and rcferved
the liberty of acting according to circumlbnces, conformably to
those views, in which {he was confirmed by the councils ol the
Chancellor de L'Hofpital. As soon as !he had known that the
Kings life was in danger, (he requclled the son of the Dukede
Montpenfier, to conduit her fecretlyone night into the apartment
of the King of Navarre, and in a long convention which ilie had
with him, foe endeavoied, with her orainary diflimulation, to
pcrfuade him, that (he wasvery far from approving all that had
palled, and wiftied to ast in concert with him, to oppose the am
bition of Ihe Guises. The Prince depended little on the finceritv
of these protections : they had however an effect in the sequel.â
On the fifth of December the King died.

REMARKS ON THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE.
IN the use of the word merchant, the people of"
this State differ from their fitter States and
from the Englifli nation. In its primitive
this word fignified any trader whatever ; that
is, any person who procured a living by buying
and felling. But etymology can not be gene
rally relied 6n, as leading to the true present lig
nification of words, which depends wholly on
national use. The word merchant, in modem
'pra<3ice, is applied only to wholesale and.
should not be confouuded with retailers or fliop
keepers. It would not be very material hbw wc
use words in Connecticut, if 110 other people
fpoke the fame language ; but this State is but
a little part of that great community, which uses
the fame language ; and no person will pretend
that we have a right to impose new meanings
upon words. At any rate it fubjedts us to-an in
convenience ; for when we use the word merchant
in our local sense, people abroad do 110 c under,
(land us, or if they do, they l'oppofe us deficient
in education.
The words Shop and Store are also confounded
in our common practice, Store being used to fig
-111 fy every kind of building where goods are
lodged for sale or security. Hence we are under
a necetfity of introducing tlie diflint'tion of
whole file Jfon and retail store. This trouble might'
be spared, by using the words according to their
true fenTe, viz. jhop for the apartment or build
ing where goods are retailed ; and store or i.-cr-e
---houfe for a building where goods are deposited
in bulk. ( American Mercury.)

In the Svvedifh account of the two actions on
the 4th and 9th ult. the defeat and the vidtory
as ftatcd in the Gazettes of Stockholm, we are in
formed, that the Ruffians, in their firft victory,
had two ships of 100 j>uns each blown up, arid five
ihips of the line disabled. This, if it be tine, is a
considerable drawback on their triumph. In theaccount of tlie brilliant atchievemcnt of his Ma- |
jefty on the 9th, the account states, that he took
and deltroyed feventyfive veflels, and that tlie
Ruffians loft jooomen. Such are the contradicto

We have already teen, that the Austrian troops
have made considerable progress in recovering

Mr. Thomas,,
IT was the answer of a certain eminent
when a (Iced by what means he acqi)i,red the
large fortune he was fuppafed to bepoflefled of,
that he had more difliculty in accumulating the
firil three thousand pounds, than all the relt of
his immoderate wealth. ,
This mny be said to coniprife the whole secret
of rifingiu the world ; and although none of the
adepts in the science have yet discovered the le
cret art of puttingthis rule in pra&ice, the indi
gent or unbefriended will find as many difiicul
ties as ever, to retard their progress, and hinder
them from emerging out of their embarrassments;
for it has been obferyed, that the in oil exalted vir
tues, and the brightest accomplilh nents, do no l
find it easy to extricate themselves out ol ditficul
ties ; this the course of human contingencies has
proved true, and daily observation ltainps a fitnc
tityonthe addition.
Perhaps in all our towns, there is fcarccly a man
who cannot in the circle of his acquaintance point
out foine one, puH'elied of extensive capacities,
firong, natural and quick parts, and a delicate
lenfibility and feeling of honor, wh.) are not how.
ever able to rail'e themselves to any coulpicuous
point of eminence, merely because their talents
have not been called forth by oppirtuniy, or
their indigence and ftrairened circumltauces
[which ever are noticed by the world] have pre
vented an animation of their abilities by fnccefs.
To preventgenius from languilhment and decay,
it mult be warmed, nurtured and clierifhed ; the
fine sensations which commonly attend an enlight
ened understanding, will occasion a dclicatc way
of thinking, which will render the podefl'or liable
to a great dejeilaon offpirirs Geniusfhould be
tenderly encouraged,or the cold blasts ofadverficy
and di.'app.iintmeut may chill it, like fruits,which
if not carefully allilted in their vegetation by the
use of hot beds, would wither unripened.
. I waslately readiug the life of that great and
good man, Lord Somsrs ; and I coula not bat.
think, that the circqmftance ef the encourage- j
ment afforded Mr. Addifon, who would hnve ;

TREASURY DEPARTMENT, Sep:. 28, 1790.
NOTICE is hereby given, that proposals will be received atthe
Office ot the Secretary of the Treasury, until the 31ft day
of December next inclufive,forthe building of a LIGHT HOUSE,
nearly of the dmien&ons proposed by the late Commiflioneis of
Virginia and Maryland, upon the lot of land on Cape Henry, in
theCbunty ot Princess Ann, and State of Virginia, lately ceded for
that purpose to the United States. It is desired* that the proposals
rmy leave the ele&ion, whether the building above the foundation
(hall be of brick, or (lone, and as the cost and charges of those ma
terials vary, it is expected, that a corresponding difference will be
made in the terms offered.
The foundation of the Light-House is to be of stone, and funk
to the depth of thirteen feet below the water table, over the top of
which the pavement is to be laid. The diameter thereof is to be
twenty seven tect fix inches, with a vacancy of about nine feet in
the ccntre.
The diameter ofthe base isto be twenty fix feet, at which place
the thickness of the walls is to be fix feet. The height from the
bottom of the water table to the top of the stone work is to be se
venty two feet,wherethe diameter istobefixteen feet fix inches,aud
the thickness of the walls three feet. The form is to be an o&agou,
having three windows in the east, and four in the weft. If it be
built of brick, it is to be faced with the glafly kind, if of Hone, it
is to be faced with hewn or hammer-dreiled stone.
On the top ofthe stone work is to be a floor of joists, bedded
therein, planked over and covered with copper, extending about
two feet eight inches beyond ihe wall, thereby forming an eve,
which is to be (lniftied with a cornice, the whole having a descent
from the centre fufiicient to throw off the water.
The lanthorn is to be supported by eight polls of wrought Iron
of three inches square and twenty feet in length, ten feet of which
are to be wrought into the stone wall on the inner part ?t each
corner. The diameter of it is to be ten feet, leaving a platform on
the oufide thereof of about fix feet in width. All the work abo\e
this is to be of iron and copper. The lanthorn is to be ten feet
high, having a feinicircular roof of five feet more( with iron raft
ers covered with copper. The whole space between the posts sup
porting the lanthorn, is to be occupied by the falhes, which air
to be made of iron, rah fafli is to have twenty-eight panes Â«>f
glass, twelve by fourteen inches. One of the fafties on the fotrh
weft fide is to be hung with hinges for a door to go out upon the
platf.'rm, from the outer part of which to the roof of the lanthoi n
isto be a frame of iron covered with a net work of strong braf*s
wire, to prefcrve the glass from injuries by hail and flights of
birds in the night.
The rafters of the lanthorn are to be wc!! faftened to an irpn
hoop, over which is a copper funnel, through which the fmokc
may pass into a large copper ventilator in the form of a man's
head, capable of containing one hundred gallons. This head is to
be so placed as to be turned by a large vane on the spire above ir,
that the hole for yeutirg the fmokc may always be to the leeward.
Eight dormant ventilators of fix inches diameter are to be fixed,
in the roof of the lanthorn.
A close stove is to be provided and fixed in the lanthorn, which â¢
is to be furnifhed with eight lamps, each capable of containing fix
quarts, hung in two tiers over each other transversely. There ar<-
to be fix flights of (lairs to ascend to the lanthorn, the entrance to
which i;s to be by a door covered with copper. The building is
to be furnifhed with two conductors, to secure it from the eftefis
of lightning.
A frame houfc is to be built for the keeper, twenty feet fquarr,
two stories high, with a frame kitchen ; the whole to be finiftied
with lath and plaifter.
A vault for the storage and fafe keeping of the oil is to be built
of (lone at a convenient distance, twelve feet wide, and twenty in
length. It is to be arched, and covered with earth m sand, over
which a shed is to be built, and it is to be furnifhed with eight
ftrong cedar ciftcrns with covers, each capable of containing two;
hundred gallonls of oil. The entrance isto be secured by a strong,
door.
Good security for the faithful performance of the contrast will
be expe&ed. Payments on account will be made at proper sta
ges of the work, and the balance will be paid on its completion .
or, if a suitable difference should be made in the terms, cash will
be advanced for the purchase of materials and provisions..
