American revolution has produced ma
. Â«y theones and fpecnlations on govern-
Jnent and politics. Leg.flators have flawed up
in eyeij pare of Europe and America who wished
to give law. to the new world, and to change
the chaos of American anarchy into a regular
and order,yfy Item It is much robe doubted,
i- her s Peculative politicians are fit
oFmII r C J , . rsofmcil ' orthe lucubrations
of the closet to form the model of public life.
The most chimerical systems of legislation have
been adopted and recommended by men of un
common genius and extensive learning. The
dreams and visions of Plato and Sir Thomas
More, and even of Milton and Locke, are, in
I *l?n^il artS ' as w " t ' alu ' eccen tric as the ravinp-s
ot Bedlam. A philosopher mav make luccefsful
experiments on air and electricity, may excel in
algebraical calculations, may wander in the ma
zes of metaphysics, without being bewildered â¢
nay, he may defend the principles of liberty
and the rights of mankind with great abilities
and much success ; and, after all, when called
upon to produce a plan of legislation, he may
aitonilh the world with the aberrations of iiuel
left and the vagaries of fancy. Mr. Locke, in
1663 was employed to compote a code ofleffifla
tion for Carolina ; with one stroke of his pen he
committed the whole authority, legifluive and
executive, to the eight proprietors of the pro
vince. By this new oligarchical sovereignty he
created at once three orders of nobility ; barons
with twelve thousand acres of land ; caciques
with twenty.four thouland ; and landgraves
with eighty thousand. Subjects were wanting
to this ill-modelled government, the colony de
cayed, and the fyltein of the philolopber perilh
ed in its abfui diiy.
Three wiir-rs i,, Europe, of abilities and re
putation, M. Turgot, the Abb:-de Mably, and
Dr. Price, have turned their attention to the po
litical constitutions of thc Uniied States of Ame
rica, and have published rothe world their (pe
culations and their criticisms. Notwithflandinir
the pure intentions of the authors, the experi
ence in" public affairs acquired by one of them*,
and the ample information concerning the na
ture of man and the l'cience of government pof
fefled by many sentiments occur in their
works which it will be difiicfllt to reconcile to
icafon, experience, the couititution of human
nature, and the firll principles of policy adopted
by all enlightened nations, whether ancient or
modern. M. T urgot in his letter to Dr. Price,
acknowledges " that he is not fatisfied with the
'< constitutions that have hitherto been formed
" for the different Suites of America." He ob
fÂ£i ves that, by most of them, the customs of
" England have been imitated, without any
" particular motive. Inrtead of collecting all
" authority into one centre, that of the nation,
" they have established different bodies ; a body
" ot representatives, a council, and a governor j
" because there is in England a house of com
" mons, a house of lords, and a king. They
" endeavor to balance these different powers,
" as it this equilibrium, which in England may
" be a neceflary check to the enormous influence
" of royalty, could be of any nfe in republics
" founded upon the equality of all thecitizens ;
" and as if eltabli/liiug ditferent orders of men
" was not a fourceof divisions and disputes-"
From the commencement of rhe revolution in
America there has been a party in every State
which entertained fentiniems similar to those of
M. Turgor. Two or three of them have ertab-
liihecl governments upon his principle ; and pro
posals have been made in several states of Ame
licato depole the governor and fenace as ulclefs
and expensive branches of the Constitution. As
the opinion of M. Turgot contributed to excite
tliel'e discontents amcng the people, Mr. Adams
held it a political and moral duty to examine his
theory at great length ; to call the experience of
part: ages to enlighten the preferit; and, from a
wide and extended view of human affairs, to mark
and ascertain tliofe principles of legislation and
government which give order, success, liability,
and duration to politico, eftablilhinents and to
civil society. The subject is certainly one of the
wort: interesting that can engage the speculation

or pro 111 pc the decilioa of men. What combina
tion of powers in society, or what form of govern -
ment is mÂ°ft likely to secure the eltabliifiment,
and the impartial execution, of good and equal
laws, so that the citizens may enjoy the benefit
or them, and confide in their perpetuity, is an
inquiry that equally concerns the philosopher and
the citizen ; for, whether the end of man, in this
itage of existence, be enjoyment or improvement,
or both, it can never be attained so well iu a bad
government as a good one,
1 he great and leading idea which runs through
the ingenious and learned work of Mr. Adams is,
that a mixture ot the three powers, the regal, the
ai iftrocratical, and the detiiocratical, properly
[ balanced, composes the mod perfetft form of go
vernment, and secures the greatelt degree of hap
piness to the greatest number of individuals â
This policy, indeed, appears to be the initiation
ot nature. Vitruvius discovered the rudiments
of architecture in the conltruc r tion of a rutticcab
'iii ; and the historian or philosopher may trace
the origin of the three powers in political society,
m the rude governments of savage tribes. Every
nation North-America has a king, a senate,
and an allembly of the people. The royal office
is elective, but it is for lit" ; the facheins form
the ordinary council, in which all the national
affairs are deliberated ant.' discussed ; but, on |
great occasions, such as declaring war, the kino
ano sachems convoke a nai ionai afTembly,
af'er a foleinn facrifice, communicate their refo-
lution to the people, fhofe who approve of the
war, yartake the facrifice, throw the hatchet into
a tree, after the example of the king, and join in
the luafeqiient war-fangs av.i dances, as a mark
of their concurrence with tle expedition. A fi
milarforin of policy prevailed apiong the ancient
Greek?. " It is ealy t o observe from Homer,"
fays Aristotle, " that the ancient governments
of Gieece were limited ; t(ie king proposed to
the a lembly of the people ,iiat beforehand had
been concerted an<l in rlic counrjl of
the chiefs. J lie political institutions of our
German ancestors were formed 011 the fame prin

j Among the ancients, the fame Tacitus extols
the form of government in which there is a chief
or leader, a senate, and a popular aflembly, tho
he doubts ot its prac'iicabilicy and duration.

ded in giving the fame preference : Stutuo ef op.

rolylnus and Dionyfius of Halicarnaflus gi ve their
teltimony to the fame doctrine, and affirm that
the molt perfect form of government is that which
conlilts of an equal mixture of monarchy, altrif
toe racy, and democracy.
1 lie observation of.M. Turgot, that " tliecuf
toms of England are imitated in moll ofthenew
constitution! in America, without any particular
motive, ' is shewn by Mr. Adams to be without
foundation. _ Supposing that the Englilh cuftoins
were merely indifferent, the people by their birth,
education, and habits, were familiarly attached
to them ; and thisfurely was a particular motive
for their preservation, rather than endanger the
public tranquility or unanimity by renouueing;
them. A divifiou of power was adopted bv the
itates, confifling of a body of representatives, a
council, and a governor, not because the leeifla
ture in England confiltcd of three branches, a
house of commons, a lionfe of lords, and a king
but because their own aflemblies had been so con!
ltituted from time immemorial ; and besides their
attachment from habit, the conclusions of reason
led them to the conviction that it was founded in
nature, and conducive to public good.

ACCOUNT oj the late Mr. JOHN LEDYARD, a
CELEBRATED TRAVELLER.
MR. LED YARD was an American by birth
and seemed from his youth to have felt an
invincible defireto make hirol'elf acquainted with
~ yer/i
621
. k*/so-
unknown or imperfectly discovered regions ot
the globe. For several years lie had lived with
the Indians of America, had studied their man
ners and had pratitifed in their fohool the means
of obtaining their protection, and of recommen
ding himfelf to the favour of lavages. In the
Humble situation of corporal of marines, to which
he submitted rather than relinquish his pursuit,
lie had made with Captain Cook the voyage round
the world, and feeling on his return an anxious
desire of penetrating from the North.weitem
coast, which Cook had. partly explored, to the
eastern coast with which he himfelf was perfectly
familiar, he determined to travel fe the vast con
tinent from the Pacific to the Atlantic Ocean.
His firft plan for the purpose was that of embark
ing in a veflel which was prepared to fail 011 a
voyage of commercial adventure to Nootka
Sound ; on the western coast of America ; and in
this view lie expended in sea stores the greatest
part of the money which his chief benefactor fir
Joseph banks, (whose generous condutfl the wri
te! of this narrative has often heard him acknow
ledge) had liberally supplied. But the fchemc
being fruftrated by the rapacity of a cnflom
house officer, who had seized and detained the
tor reasons which on legal enquiry, proved
to be frivolous, he determined to travel overland
to Kanifchatka, from whence the paflage to the
western coast of America is extremely /lion.
With not more than ten guineas in his purse,
which was all that he had left, he eroded the
'tiwi Channel to Oltend, and by that of Den
mark and the Sound proceed to the capital of
Sweden ; from whence as it was winter, he at
tempted to traverse the Gulph of Bothnia on the
ice, in order to reach Kanifchatka by the flioi test
way ; but finding when he came to the middle
ot the sea that the water was not froze;:, lie re
turned to Stockholm, and taking Ins course
northward, walked into the Axftic circle, and
parting round the head of the Gulph, descended
on i'j eastern fide to Peterfbnrfth.
1 here he was soon noticedas an extraordinary
man. Without stockings or shoes, and too much
poverty to provide himfelf with either,he received
and accepted an invitation to dine with the Por
tuguese Ambaflador, 1" 0 this invitation ic was
probably owing that he was able to obtain the
urn of twenty guineas for a bill on Sir lofeph
banks, which he confeffed he had no authority
to draw, but which, in consideration of the busi
ness that lie had undertaken, andof the prog, efa
that he made, Sir Joseph, he believed, would not
be unwilling to pay. To the Ambaflador's in
terest it might also be owing that he obtained
permiflion to accompany a detachment of stores
which the t-mprefs had ordered to be Cent to
Yakutz, for the use of Mr. Billings an En<rli(h
man at that time in her service. &
rhrnnT c-Â°'. n Â°'"Â° date d he travelled eaftwavd
through Siberia 6Â°Â°Â° â n les to Yakutz, where he
was kindly received by Mr. Billings, whom he

of the Ruffian veflels, that trade to the western
Ihores of America ; but finding that the navÂ£?
tion was completely obftrudted by the ice he re
turned again to Yakutz, in order to the
conclusion of the winter.

[Who le No. i 56.]i"ound a person frho Was willing to take his draft
for five guineas oti the Prelideut of the Royal
Society.
With this affiftancehe arrived in England, and
immediately waited on Sir Joseph Banks, who
told him, knowing his temper, that he believed
lie could recommend him to an adventurealmoft
as perilous as the one from which he had return
ed ; and then communicated to him the wilhes
of the aifociation fordifcoveriug '.he inland coun
tries of Africa.
Mr. Ledyard replied, that he had always de
termined to traverse the contiitent of Africa, as
f >qn as he had explored the interior parts of 1
North America ; and as Sir joseph had offered
him a letter of introduction, he came dire (ft to
the writer ot these memoirs. Before I had
learnt from the note the nanieandbufinefsofmy
viGtor, I was it ruck with the manliness of his
person, the breadth of his cbeft, the openness of
his countenance, and the iuquietude of his eye.
J opened the map of Africa before him, and tra
cing a line from Cairo to Sennar, and from
thence weft ward in the latitude and supposed di
rection of the Niger, 1 told him that was the rout
by which 1 was anxious that Africa might, if pos
sible, be explored. He said he ihould think him
felf Angularly fortunate to be entrulted with the
adventure. I asked him when he would set out ?
âTo-morrow morning was his answer.
Oil this grand Adventure Mr. Ledyard left
London on June 30th, 1788, and reached Cairo,
in Egypt, on the 19th of Anguft, from whence
he transmitted such accounts to his employers as
plainly (hewed he was atraveller of observation
and reflection, endowed with a foul for discove
ry, and formed for atchievments of hardihood
and peril. Jie had promised his next communi
cation for Sennar, about 600 miles south of Cai
ro ; bat death put an end to the hopes that were
entertained of his proje&ed journey.
We (hall conclude this (hort (ketch with Mr.
Ledyard's character of the female sex : " I have
always remarked that women, in all countries,
are civil, obliging, tender and humane ; that
they are ever inclined to be gay and cheerful,
timorons and modest ; and that they do not he
fitate, like men, to perform a generous aÂ«ftion.
Not haoghty, arrogant, nor supercilious, they
are full of courtesy, and-fond of society ; more
liable in general to err tliaii man, bat generally
more virtuous, and performing more good adti-
he. To a woman, either civilized or
savage, k never addrefied myfelf in the language
of decoram and friendihip, without receiving a
decent and friendly answerâwith men it has ben
otherwise.

HOW much of the difference of character, we

and how much to original cad of difpoiition, is a
queition that cannot, in any given iultance, be
accurately solved. A combination of circum
stances, merely adventitious, operate in forming
the propensities which characterize every indi
vidual. Perhaps the mind of every person is
predisposed to cherifli certain inipreflions more
readily than others, and when an accident oc
curs that coincides with the natural bent of tem
per, it heightens its itrength and permanency.
On the other hand, events purely accidental may
produce a change in our original bias, and raif'e
allocations that turn the current of our affections
from the point to which they were aiming. Itis
observed of Dean Swift that he had so irritable a
temper, as gave to the flightelt difappointmenr a
mod excruciating fling. In a letter to Lord 80.

terms. ' I remember when I was a boy,l felt a great

feelings of good humor and serenity as would
gradually have acquired the force of habit, and

makes the following remarks, after mentioning
the difappointmenc relative to the fifh.
" This little incident, perhaps, gave the firft
wrong exereile to a mind, predisposed to fuel*
imprelfions ; and by operating so long and so
forcibly, might polTibly lay the foundation oft he
Dean's subsequent peeviihuefs, pailion, mii'anthro

The fame author mentions many instances of
the lading allociations that are produced by at.
cidental circuniftances, and which may have a
very forcible impression in directing the efforts
of the underltanding and the feelings of the
heart, differently from the course they had ta
ken, previous to such accidents. Among other
instances the following is a pertinent one. " Dr.
Conyers Middleton, one of the inoft learned,
various and elegant writers of the present age,
isfaid to have been much more addicted, in the
eaily part of life, to music, than to fcieuce. Cue
he was ronfed from his favorite auiufesneut, and
ftinaulated to the dofeft application to study, by
a farcaiin of his rival'and enemy, the celebrated
Dr. Bently who ftigtnatized him with the name
of fiddler. And indignation made bim eager to
convince the Doctor and the world, that be conld
write as well as fiddle ; a conviction, of which his
opponent had, afterwards, the molt painful ex
perience.
The death of a friend, and Other heavy afflic
tion* fometiines give a gloomy cast to the mind,
and lead it into a train of melancholy reflexions ;
which, if Hot counteracted by incidents that pro
mote chearfulneip, uiay become habitual. It is
of the highest importance that people guard them
selves against that aflociation of ideas which par.
ticular events may create. By indulging a train
of feelings that are eleited accident ally,they di
fufe themselves through the whole life and cha
racter. One man is thus rendered paffiopate and
peeviih ; another gloomy and discontented, and a
third capricious and inconltant. Had either of

YESTERDAY afternoon the signal for ail Captains was dis
played on board the Queen Charlotte, Lord Howe's flag (nip
which was instantly obeyed.
This morning his Lordship threw out the signal for failirgâ
Preparations were immediately made by every (hip in the fleet*
Bv ten o'clock. A. M. many of them were unmoored ; an* 4 -Â»t
three P. M. tne whott fleet was clear of On. baj.
Never were orders obeyed with greater alacrity, or with more
universal good will; for no sooner were the direct-ons given to
man the capllcrns, than the exulting fhoutsof the sailors bespoke a
ready concurrence : and never before, perhaps had the boatswains
lets to do in the weighing of an anchor.
An officer, froin a veficl arrived in the offine, went yesterday on
board the Queen Charlotte, with intelligence that they had feeo
theSpÂ«mifh fleet a few days before, in the bay of Biscay, and that
it confuted of upwards of thirty fail of the line, behdes frigates,
&.c. See,
We know not whether this circumflancc haftcned the motion*
which immediately followed, but it had not taken place au hour
before the lignal was made for all the captains.
Six o'clock, P. M. The whole fleet have now doubled the
start; the wind has veered considerable to the Northward, aeÂ«i
they are now (landing down channel with a fine breeze.
Each Captain has sealed orders, and from their course, when

THE FAMILY COMPACT
Extracted from the Debates of the National Atfembl?
of Francs on Monday lajl
THE President reaa a letter from M. Montmb- |
rin to the following purport :
" The King commanded me last May to lay be-
fore the Allembly the reasons which made it ne
cellary to order an equipment of I 4 fail of the line,
which measure the Allembly approved. I mult
now lay before theni the reasons which feein to
make it necellary to encreafe this armament which
is in perfedt readinefs.âlt is prudent that we
ihould have an equal force with Great Britain,
who is hastening her's with all poilible activity.
The King of Spain has claimed the execution ot
the Treaty with Great Britain, and his Aiubafla
dor here claims that of the Family Compafl. '1 he
King therefore has thought proper to bring this
demand of the Spanifli Ambafiador belore the
Aflembly for its deliberation.
" The Aflembly will have two points to deli

Besides the above letters from M. Montmorin,
another from the Count Fernanda Nunez, the
Spaniih Ambaflador at Paris, to M. de Montmo
rin, was likewise read. It is dated the 7th of
June, and after mentioning the negociation go
ing 011 with England, concludes thus :
" The speedy and exa<ft execution of the 1 rea

Mr. Fitzherbert's letter to the Count de i lori
da Blanca at Madrid was then read. It exprefles
a desire of peace, explains the ground ot com
plaint 011 account of the detention of two English

The Spaniih Ambassador's answer, begins by
fhewingthe uncertainty of the injury done to
the Engliih (hips that they had been detained
in places belonging to Spain by virtue of treaties.

NEW-YORK, OCTOBER 9
The matter of a veflel who arrived at Phila
delphia, in 36 days from Corunna, reports, that
a terrible fire broke out in Madrid, which haa
confutned a very contiderable pare of that city.
Thfc Spanifli fleet was cruising ofFCape Finnifterre
when the Captain left Spain.
At the storming of Czettin by the Ruffians, 2000 lurks were
killed.âSpain according to accounts from that kingdom has no
idea of paying the Britifll bill of costs in equipping their fleet ;
why Ihould they ? The Britilh would laugh at such a demand on
the part of Spain ; the cafe is vice versa without doubt.
According to the convention laid to be finned between Austria
and Pruflia, the former is to abandon all its conquests from the
Turks, and to renounce its alliance with Ruilia ; hard term in
deed ! Frederic is to receive for this fuccefstul intcrpoiition
io,cooooo piafhes from the porte.

The Spanifti and Englilh fleets being at fca, foinething impor
tant may be daily eicpc&cd from ihe Eaflern hemisphere ; im
portant to the parties immediately engagedâhow much to to the
United States time may unfold.
The idea thrown out by Dr. Price of an alliance between
France and England, Was taken up in the national assemblyâand
M.C. de Lameth suggested the propriety of add re fling the peo
ple of England through the Revolution Society ; this was objefck
cd to by leveral members as being neither judicious or patriotic â
as England is not governed by a club, but by a parliament.
The Englilh papers Hate that the French have al Breit 25 fail of
the line ready for sea.
The Frenchman who attempted to alTaflinatc Count Florida
Blauca was executed at Madrid 011 the 18 August.
The English papersgive an account of a drenchingenterprize at
Bnghthclmftone, in which Lord Bairymore and a royal Duke
fufiained the inoft conspicuous parts. A large furn of money be
ing deposited by the parties : he that could wade the furtheli into
the water with his cloaths on was to take the whole. Barrymore
beat the Duke. Such are the noble and royal pastimes of Bri
tain's riling hopes !
An indiscriminate publication, in v\mcrican papers, of Englifti
articles of news and politics, is supposed to be geneially reproba
ted ; but fact and experience prove that this is not the cafe : lor
tho the English papers contain an infinity ot conjectures, fuppoli
tions, and totally bafelcfs fabrications, and very tew faÂ£ts ; yet it
is apparant that the printers of those American gazettes, who dish
up the lavgeft quantity ot the heterogeneous mass, find the t ac
count ih itâThere is one reflection which is cxcited on the occa-
fioti, not of the moil pleasing kind, and that is, that this taste in
dicates cither that we feel too much lntereflcd in the concerns of
that country, or that we have imbibed too ftiong a diipoiition to
be pleased with frivolity.
Very few English new fpapers are independent, and very little
that it conveyed through thr mwlium of party is pure, triie, or
honorable ; a free paper is generally undeiftood there to be, one
that is full ot abufc of the powers that be, or ot those who think
tor themlelves, ofrdf the party in whose cause it undertakes : You
may read such publications till your eyes fail, and never be a whit
the wiser j many such arc the sources from whcnccthe American
fount of European news and politics is supplied : In reipeÂ£t to
the French revolution, what a gloomy al\>cÂ£t is thrown upon it by
the latest Englilh accounts. While thar nation appears to be ex
ulting in the progrefsof their Conllitution *, while the people arc
as one itiah uniting and rejoicing in the benign influence o! a tree
and Iwearing in the mod solemn manner to support
their rights and privileges, we ate told that M. Fayette is their
King, General, and Supreme Legifiator, that he is the implacable
enemy of M. D'Orleans, and will briughim to the block, or con
fifcate his large pollcH'ions, that difcontcnts the empire,
that the King of Sardiuia is on the point of invading the king
dom, and that the refugees, with the Prince de Conde at their
head, has aflemblcd an army to second Ins efforts, that the permit
ting the Aultrians to marcn thro pait of France* is admitting an
enemy into then country, who will cftett a counterrevolution,
that the King's sickness is meer finefTe to facilitate an elopement
from the kingdom, and in fliorr, that the profpeÂ£ls of the revolu
tionifls are dark, gloomy Jand dreadful ; but there is one circum-
Itance, tliat is really not cafy to be accounted for, and that is,
while many Bn:ilh charaders are nobly engaged in fighting the
cause of freedom in the low countries, as volunteers and officeis
of diilin&ion in the Bclgi# fcrvice, their countrymen, the Editors
of the British newspapers arc perpetually venting their spleen
againftthe patriots, in a series ot iour, ill-natured paragraphs ; it
is very rare that a commendatory fen:enee escapes their pens -
What advantage can Americans derive ftom such opinionated felt
fufficicnt cgotifts ? t .
An elegant writer in the Poughkecplte Journal of 2d urn. wnofe
produttions we conjecture, have before contributed to the enter
tainment of our readers, concludes foine very judicious remarks
on the French Revolution in the following words : "In the lat
-44 ter part of the 17th century, when the remains of French libtr
" ty were extinguished under the despotic monarchy of Louis 14. h,
14 the condition ol the kingdom was however vaftlv mended, and
44 its reputation carried to the higheit pitch by the aits of peace,
44 arid the atcluevcments of war ; but his intolerant lpirit banilh
-44 cd a vast l,ody of his indubious fubjed*, and his inordinate am
-44 bition enkindled wars ruinous to his own people, and dauger
" ous to the liberties of Europe. In our day they have complete
-44 ly recovered their civil and religious rights, and by a grand ai
'4 iociation have sworn to maintain them. How diftinttly the
44 comparative merit of those ages is marked between the inhu
'4 man government of Catherine and her sons, the magnificence ot
" Louis XIV, and the freedom of the National AfTembly ? It re
" mains only to be wished that their zeal may be so tempered by
" moderation, and their rcafomng so corrcded by experimental
" wiidom, as to lead them to fix a conftuution so adjuited in all

44 own principles."

THE Constable, whom the court afFe&ed to
urge less, bccaufe he was in a place where
lie might be more easily compelled, had com
menced his journey with more confidence in ap
pearance, but in reality with more precaution.
He had not abetted the difcoutented but with his
counsels, which only tended to demand justice of
the States, without plotting con (piracies, or ex
citing infurredlions. A refufal to go to court
might fortify the i'ufpicions conceived against
liim: He therefore employed artifice and difli
niulatioii, to delay his arrival and regulate his pro
ceedings by the example of the Princes. Arriv
ed at Paris, he pretended to be attacked with the
gout, and returned to Chantilly to re-eftablith
his health. He again attempted to proceed, but
under the pretext that the change of air and the
motion of the carriage incommoded him,which his
advanced age rendered plauftble enough, he tra
velled by iittle day's journeys, frequently by
cross ways, at a distance from the great road,
where he made long delays, to prolong the time,
till the arrival of the Princes. His sons, iiv per
suading him to hasten his march, reprefentea to
hiin, that neither the Queen-mother nor the Guis
es would ever dare to attempt any thing againit
a man, so refpedled as he was in the kingdom.
The Conftable,inftrudled by experience, anfwer
edthem, that the ministry could govern the Hate
at its pleasure, and without opposition, though
t * l . e 7 '" eeme d to be preparing for themfetves a for
midable one, by calling the States General. That
this condudt inveloped some myfteriotis intrigue,
which heihould be able to unveil, with a little
patience. This judicious reflection abated the
ardor of the young Lords, and the Constable con
tinued to temporize.
Nevertheless the King of Navarre and the
Prince of Conde hail been received on the fron
tiers by the Marshal deThermes, who, under the
pretext of paying them the honors due to their
rank, followed iheni with a large body of Caval
ry, to make sure of the cities become fulpedled
by the deposition of La Sague. At the fame time;
he ordered poH'efTion to be taken by other troops,
both of Cavalry and Infantry, of all the reads,
ivhic'i the Princes lefc behind them,left, a change
of their resolution Ihould determine thein to re
turn. As i'ooii as it was known at court, that
the Princes had entered the kingdom, and were
so well observed by De Tlierines, they arretted,
all on a sudden Jerome Giollot, Bailif of Orleans,
accused of intelligence with the Hugonots, to
cause a revolt of that city in favor of the discon
tented Princes ; and by order of the King, they
sent to prison the Vidaine of Chartres, who had
been imprudent enough to remain in the Capital.
They had not the fame success in attempting to
seize Dandelot. As prudent and subtle in pro
viding against dangers, as ardent and daring in
forming deligns, he retired suddenly to thecoafts
of Brittany, resolved to embark for England in
cafe of neceflity.- The Admiral, whose add rets
and dissimulation, according to Davila, had hi
therto conduced everything,without discovering
or expofmg liimlelf, was among isthe firft in the
States General, with design there to labor in fa
vor of his party. The King and the Qneen had
received him as usual, with benevolence. He
employed himfelf in following with his eye, all
the measures of the court, in order to give in
formation of them, secretly, and with extreme
precautions, to tlie Constable and the King of
Navarre,
All thrfs delays were exhausted, when the
Princes of the blood arrived at Orleans, the 29th
OiSober, without any person's going out to re
ceive them, except aftiiall number of their nioft
intimate friends. They found not only the gates
of the city guarded, but bodies of guards placed
and batteries erec'ted in the ftrongell potts, in the
cross ftreetsand public places : precautions which
tjie court had not ufiially taken in times of war.
They pafled through the midst of this formidable
apparatus, and came to the King's Lodge, where
they kept a more exadl guard, than at the head
quarters of an army. Arrived at the gate, they
would have entered on liorfe-back, according to
the right attached to their rank : but they found
only a wicket gate open, and were obliged to
alight 111 the open ttreet, and few persons appear
ed to t eceive or salute them. They were con
duifted to the King, whom they found fitting be
tween the Duke of Guise and the Cardinal of
Lot-rain,furrounded by the Captains of his guards.
He received the King of Navarre and the Prince
of Conch, with a coldness very different from
t.iat a..ability whicli the Kings of France are ac
cultomed to practice to all their fubjecfts but
above all to the Princes of their blood.' He con
ducted them soon to the Queen-mother, where
the Guises did not follow them. Catharine of
Medicis, who wiihed always to appear neuter and
disinterested, received them with ordinary de
monstrations of friendlhip, bat with an aft'sdled
sorrow, and artificial tears. The King continued
to treat tliem with the fame coldnels,and addred
ing hinifelf to the Prince of Cnnde, lie began to
reproach him, that without having received from
his Majesty, cither displeasure or ill treatment,
he had in contempt of all laws,divine and human,
excited several times his fubjed:s, inkindled a
war in different parts of his kingdom, attempted
to seize on his principal cities, and conspired
against his life and that of his brothers. The
Prince, without emotion, answered with firmnefs,
that these accuf.itions were so many calumnies
forged by his enemies. We mult proceed then,
replied the King, by the ordinary ways of justice,
to discover the truth. He went out ofthe apart
ment of the Queen, and commanded the Captains
of his guards to arrest the Prince ofConde. The
Queen-mother, forced to consent to this measure,
but who had not forgotton that things might
change, from one moment to another, exerted
herfelf to console the King of Navarre. The
Prince complained of none but the Cardinal of
Bourbon his brother,who had deceived him ; and
fufFered himfelf to be condtiified to a neighbour
ing house, deltined for hjs prison. They had
walled up the windows, doubled the doors, and
made it a kind of fortrefs defended by several
pieces of artillery and a strong guard. The
King of Navarre, astonished at the detention of
his brother, breathed out his grief in complaints
and reproaches to the Queen, who, calling all the
blame on the Duke ofGUife, as Lieutenant-Gene
ral of the Kingdom, endeavored only to excul
pate herfelf. To the King of Navarre,they gave
for a lodging, an house, at a little distance from
that which the King occupied, and guards to ob
serve his motions ; so that, excepting the liberty
of feeing whom he pleased, he was in all other
refpedls treated and confined like a prisoner. At
the fame they arretted Bouchart his secretary,
with all his letters and papers ; and Madeleine
de Roye, mother in law of the Prince, with all
her letters and papers, at her feat at Anifi. Al
though they held the gates of Orleans shut, and
fufFered no person to go out, the news of these
tranfadlions were anuounced to the Constable,
who was still but a few leagues from Paris. He
suspended his journey, resolved to pass no fur
ther, but to wait andobferve the consequences of
these events.
I hus the mystery fufpe<fted by the Constable
was unriddled. The States General were funi
moned only as a net is laid, artfully to befprung
upon game. This game were the Conltable and
Princes, and their principal friends. They were
a mere stalking-horse, behind which to lhoot a
wood-cock ; and that wood-cock was the Prince
of Conde. Although of the two authorities which
were up, the Court and the States, neither was
supreme ; yet the one we fee might be taken by
the other. We Uiallfoon fee that confufion en
tered by the gap.
