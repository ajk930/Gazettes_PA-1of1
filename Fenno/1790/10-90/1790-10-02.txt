AN Abbe reproachedthe National Aff-rably of France for de

THE TABLE f
No. CXLV.
" Every objett ajfumes an importance, in our rfli
motion, proportioned, in fame degree, to the tabor a/ij
attention we bestow ttpon it."
NO employment is thought useless ; no
tuation uninterelting, in the view of him
who occupies it. Quixotifin, in some fiiape or
other, infufes itfelf into the conJuc'i of every hu
man being, and bellows an exaggerated value on
his character and attainments. How common is
it for men, when they are speaking of a proief
fion, in which they themselves atfl, toconlerfucli
encomiums on its utility and importance, as would
make an ignorant by-slander imagine, nothing
else could be compared to it, so excellent and ule
ful ! But how mult his admiration cease, and li:s
opinions change, when lie hears twenty perlons
in a day, heaping the fame extravagance of ay>-
plaufe, on the modes of life they refpecftively
pursue ! The fame fpeciei of delulion leizes the
imagination when we are eflimating the value of
any favorite principle or tenet, as prevails when
we are valuing our occupation or profeffion. â
Those who acquire some degree of polemic skill,
and cherish any fondnefs for it, either about re
ligion or polities, are apt to'feletft some particular
point, and pursue it so far, and so long, as real
ly to believe every thinggreat or excellent is con
centered in it, and that it is merely a waste or
time to think or speak upon any other subject.
An elegant writer in an eflay on difput at ion makes
the following sprightly remarks :â" Polemic
skill is a dangerous qualification ; and if not go
verned by charity, wisdom and integrity, may be
tray the poflefl'or, either into intemperate z.eal,
or absolute indifference for truth. The fame
enthusiasm that dignifies a butterfly or medal to
the virtuoso and the antiquary, may convert con
troverfyinto quixotifni, and present to the delu
ded imagination of a theological or political
knight-errant, a barber's bason, as Mumbreuo's
helmet."
Perhaps there is no defer!ption of men, who
understand or love the truth so little, as thofo
who are impelled by the rage of controversy. 1c
too often happens that we embrace a system or a
principle before we have examined the proofs or
reafcyis on which it rests. By this means, an at
tachmeut is fixed to the theory itfelf, independent
of the truth which ought to support it. We thus
become regardless of right and wrong, as they
are applicable to dodtrinegor sentiments ; and it
is not difficult to perceive that we insensibly ac
quire the fame indifference forthofe diflincftions,
in our language and conduit. Such a disregard
to the moral nature of obje&s often grows upon
an heart which originally gave no indications of
extraordinary perverfenefs. It has been the ef
feA of an inordinate love of disputation, and a
pride ofconqaeft over others in argument, con
tracted by inadvertently falling iuto habits of
difcuflion, for the fake of defending ingenious
theories, or discovering a dexterity in mental re
sources.
One cannot too much control a desire for con
troversy, for ifit be left to itfelf unchecked by
reason and propriety, it will become a vicious
and irregular propensity. Every person, in his
invefligations, should be solicitous to attain the
truth, and should never facrifice it to theory.â
For however much we may have labored to de
fend an hypothesis, and however important it
may feeni 111 our eyes, it mud sooner or later be
tried by fair and impartial judges, who will ex
amine it not by our prejudices and prepofleflions ;
but by that standard which will exist, when the
current whims and follies of the day may be for
gotten.

DISCOURSES ON DAVILA.
My foul aches,
To know, w:un two authorities arc up,
Neither supreme, how foou coutufion
May cuter 'iwixt the gap of both, and take
The one by the othct. Shakespzar.
WHtN the King is of age, and allilts at the
States General, the deputies had the pow
er to consent to his demands ; to propose what
they judge neceflary tof the good ot the differ
ent orders of the Hate ; to make their fubmiflions
in the name of the people to new impolts ; to
establish ana accept of new laws, and new regu
lations ; but when the minority of the Prince,
or fjme other incapacity hinders him to govern
by himfelf, the states have a right in cafe of con
testation, to eledt the regent of the kingdom, to
nominate to the principal offices, to forma coun
cil, and, if the mafciiline pollerity have failed in
the royal family, they may eleift a new Monarch,
following however, the dispositions of thefalique
law. Excepting these cases of necefiity, the
Kings were accuitonved to allemble the States Ge
neral, in urgent conjunctures, and to determine,
according to their advice, in affairs of molt im
portance. " In effect ?" fays Davila, " what
energy may not the resolutions ot the Prince de
rive, from the concurrence of his fubjeifts ! What
can be more conformable to the true spirit ot
monarchical government, than this harmony be
tween the sovereign and the people ?" In truth,
Davila, tho thou art a profound Historian, thou
art but a fupcrticial Legislator. Hiitory answers
the queltion, that no energy at all, nor any thing
but divilion, diftradtion anil extravagance were
derived to the resolutions of the Prince, till the
Itates were laid aside. In the language of my
motto, two authorities were up, neither supreme,
and confufion entered 'twixt the gap. Nothing
can be more direiitiy repugnant to monarchical
government than such aflemblies, because they
set up rivals to the King, and excite doubts and
tjueftions, in whom the sovereignty resides. If a
negative is given by them,to the will of the Prince,
they become a part ofthe sovereignty, annihilate
the Monarchy and convert it into a Republic.
If they are mere councils of advice, they become
scenes of cabal, for aspiring grandees to force
themselves into the niinittry.âNever indeed was
it more neceflary to new model the government,
and regeHerate the nation, than in the present
conjuncture, when the rivalries of the grandees,
and the differences in religion, dilturbed the
â¢whole kingdom, and demanded the prompted re
medies.
Upon the reiterated orders of the court, the
deputies of the Provinces, had resorted to Or
leans, from the beginning of October 1560, and
the KinÂ£ having arrived in person, accompanied
by the molt of the Lords and great officers of the
crown, they waited only for the discontented
Lords and Princes, to open the Aflembly. The
Conltable and his sons, were, as usual, at Chan
tilly. The King of Navarre and the Prince of
Conde, were fti'l at Beam. The King had writ
ten to them all, to invite them to the States ; and
akho they had not explicitly refufed, they in
vented pretexts upon pretexts, to excuse them
selves, and gain time. These affected delays dif
trefled the King and the ministry. They appre
hended, with reafbn.that the refufal of the Princes
of the blood, arising from their own suspicions,
or upon foine,certain information of what was in
tended against them, would defeat all the pro
jects and preparations, founded only on the hope
that they would affilt at the States General. The
Prince of Conde, could not be in doubt that they
had drawn, either from theprifonersof Amboife,
or from La Sagne, or from the conspirators ai rest
ed at Lyons, evidence fufficient to dil'cover his
deligns. No motive, therefore, could determine
liiin to place himfelf a second time, at the dilcre
tion of a court where his enemies were all pow
erful. The King of Navarre thought differently.
Less culpable, or more credulous than his bro
ther, lie believed, that by going to the States,
they ffiould obtain, without difficulty, that re
form in the government, which had already cost
them so much labor ; whereas, by refuting to be
present, they would betray their own interests,
and leave the field open to the ambition and vio
lence of the Princes of Lorrain. He could not
believe, that under the eyes of the whole nation
afiembled, a King scarcely out of his infancy, an
Italian Princess, and two Itrangers, would dare
to imbrue their hands in the blood of the Princes
of the royal house, which the Monarchs the molt
absolute anil the molt vindictive, had ever re
garded as sacred. All these motives determined
him to venture to the States, with the Prince, to
whom he represented, that they would infallibly
condemn him unheard, if he continued obstinate
ly to ablent himfelf from court : whereas, by ap
pearing there, and gaining to his interests the
deputies in the Stares, there was every reason to
liop^,"that if, on judging him with rigor, they
ffiould blame his proceedings, the equity of his
pretentions, would afford him a favourable co
lour, and ill the la(t extremity, his birth would
obtain him a pardon. All the confidants and
No. XXI,
partizans of tlie Princes, supported tins ail vice,
except the wife and mother-in-law or the i mice
of Conde, who constantly rejected ic, and judged
that hialife was aimed at, and that of all the
courses he coulil take,that which was recommend
ed to him was the most dangerous.

the conduct of Spain does not appear very humi

disappointed when they find that Spain is not to

NEW-YORK, OCTOBER 2.
Capt. Barnes, who arrived at Boston in 36 days
from Ferrol, informs that a letter received by
the Britifti Consul there, from the Briti(h Am
baflador at Madrid, intimated that lie was doubt
ful whether the concession made by Spain would
produce a reconciliation between the two Courts.
Capt. Barnes further informs, that when he lefc
I'errol great preparations for war were making
at that placeâand that every thing wore the
appearance of an immediate rupture.
The Englifii appear to be much diffatisfifcd
with the late comprotnife made by Mr. Pitt with
Spainâbut he has heretofore come oft vi<flori

juftify his own condudt ; if he cannot man the

In consequence of the defeat of the King of
Sweden on the 3d and 4th Julyâit is surmised by
the Englifli politicians, that the King of Pruflia
will attack Catharineâin order to prevent an
undue preponderance of the balance of power in
her favor.
This balance of power,a most flimfey pretence
for going to war, has too long proved a curse to
the European Itates.âLouis the XlVth, under
the pretext of supporting this ideal equilibrium,
destroyed the liberties of Franceâand the En

fieed thousands of their Veterans in Germany.â

this, fancy had exerted its powers in ornament

children, sons of Dr. Abel Hall, were playing
near a well, the youngelt of them about three
years of age,leaning against the curb of the well,
the upper board of which was nailed on the in

fell twenty three feet, when his head ltruck the
water into which he plunged, and immediately
rising received instantaneous alfiftance ; Capt.
Ebenezer Halj, descending into the well, by
the pole, seized the child, before it could fink
again, and taking it into his arms was drawn up
and restored him to his diftrelled mother; the
child having not received the lealt bruise or

voucher to the Secretary of the Treasury ; upon the production
and delivery ot which to,him, a warrant will issue to the office,
to which thf debt is to be transferred, where the bufincfs will be

In every cafe of a transfer of the fubferibed or funded debt, the

APPLICABLE TO THE
PRESENT STATE OF the AMERICAN COLONIES.
Written in the Year 1776,
By the VICE-PRESIDENT of the Unites St ates,
Then a Member of Con rtfs ;
In a*LETTER to the Hon. GEORGE WYTHE,
oIVIRCINIA.
(Concludedfrom our UJt.)
TN the present exigency ofAmer.can affairs.when.by an*a of Pa -
1 liament we are pat out of the royal protest, on, and
ly discharged from our allegiance ; and it has become necessary to
â¢kmc government for our immediate fecunty, the Gov Lieut.
Gov. Secretary, TreaCurer, Comm.ffary, Attorney-Genera]l, Ihould
be chosen by joint ballot, ot both Houses. And thee and all other
cleÂ£l:ons, especially of Representatives and Councilors, Ihould be
annual, there not being in the whole circle of the fc.ences, a max
im more infallible than this, Â« Where annual elea.ons end, there
slavery begins."
These great men, in this refpeft, should be, once a year
" Like bubbles on the sea of matter borne,
" They rife, they bunk, and to that sea return."
This will teach them the great political virtues of humility, pa
tience, and moderation, without which every man in power be
comes a rav: nous beast of prey. , ,
This mode of confuting the great offices of date will answer
â very well for the present ; but if, by experiment, it Ihould be
found inconvenient, the legislature may, at its leisure, devise other
methods of creating them, by eleaions ot the people at large, as
in Omneaicut, or it may enlarge the term for which they (hall
be chosen to seven years, or three years, or for life. or make any
other alterations which the society (hall find produtlive ot us ea(e,
its fafety, its freedom, or in one word, it? happint fs.
A rotation of all offices, as well ai of Representatives and Coun
sellors has many advocates, and is contended for with many plau
sible arguments. It would be attended no doubt with many ad
vantages, and if the focicty has a fuffirient number of Tunable cha
raOe.s to supply the great nun-'.er of vacancies which would be
made by such a rotation, I can fee no objection to it. These per
sons mav be allowed to fcrve for three years, and then be excluded
three year", or for any longer or (horter term.
Any seven or nine of the legidative Council may be made a
Quorum, for doing bufincfs as a Privy Council, to advise the Go
vernor in the exercifeof the executive branch of power, and in
*11 afis of state.
The Governor (hould have the command of the militia, and ot
*11 your armies. The power of pardons ihould be with the Go 1
\>ernor and Council.
Judges, juftiees and all other officer", civil and military, Ihould
be nominated and appointed by the Governor, with the advice
Â»nd consent of Council, unless you choose to have a government
more popular; if you do, all officers, civil and military, may be
chosen by joint ballot of both houses, or in order to preserve the
independence and importance ot each house, by ballot of one
house, concurred by the other. Sheriffs (hould be chosen by the
freeholders of counties- so (hould Registers of Deeds and Clerks
of Counties.
All officers (hould have commiflions, under the hand of the Go
vernor and seal of the Colony.
The dignity and (lability of government in all its branches, the
morals ot the people and eveiv blcffing of society, depend so
mi ch upon an upright and (killful adminiflration otjuftice, that
the judicial power ought to be diilina from both the legislative
and executive, and independent upon both, that so it may be a
check upon both, as both (hould be checks upon that. The
Judges therefore should always be men of learning md experience
in the laws, of exemplary morals, great patience, calmness, cool
ness and attention. Their minds (hould not be diftraaed with
jarring interefls; they (hould not be dependant upon any man, or
bodyof men. To thefeends they (hould hold c'.tates for life in
their offices, or in other words their commiflions (hould be during
good behavior, and their salines ascertained and eftablilhed by law
For misbehavior the grand Inqucll of the Colonv, the House ot
Representatives, should impeach them before the Governor and
Council, where they (hould have time and opportunity to make
their defence, but if conviaed, (hould be removed from their of
fices, and fubjeaed to such other punilhmeot as lhall bethought
proper.
A militia law, requiring all men, or with very few exceptions,
liefides cases ol conscience, to be provided with arms aud ammu
nition, to be trained at certain seasons, and requiring counties,
towns, or other small diftrias, to be provided with public (locks
of ammunition and entrenching utensils, and with some fettled
plans for transporting provisions atter the militia, when marched
to defend their country against sudden invasions, and requiring
ceiuin diftritls to be provided with field pieces, companies of
tnatroffes, and perhaps some regiments of light horse, is always a
wife inlluution, and in the present circuinftanccs of our country,
indifpenfible. .
Laws for the liberal education of youth, especially of the lower
class of pcopie, aie so extremely wife and ufelul, that to a humane
and generous mind, no cxpence for this purpose would be thought
exiravagant.
The very mention of famptuary laws will cxcitc a smile. Wheth
er our countrymen have wisdom and virtue enough to submit to
them I know not. But the happiness of the pcopie might be
greatly promoted by them, and a revenue laved (juicient to carry
on this war forever. Frugality is a great revenue, beftdes curing
*is of vanities, levities, and fopperies, which are real antidotes to
all great, manly and warlike virtues.
But mud not all commiflions run in the name of a King ? No.
"Why may they npt as well run thus, " The Colony of to
A. B. greeting', and be tested by the Governoi ?
Why may not writs, instead of running in the name of a King,
run thus, " The Colony of to the Sheriff, &c." and be
reded by the Chief Tuftice.
Why msy not indidtments conclude, " against the peace of the
Colony of and the dignity of the fame ?"
A Constitution, founded on these principles, introduces know
ledge among the people, and mfpirts them w'th a confeious dig
nity, becoming Freemen. A general emulation takes place, which
causes good humour, sociability, good manners, and good morals
to be general. That elevation of sentiment, inspired by such a
government, makes the common people brave and enterprizing.
That ambition which is inspired by it makes them lober, indust
rious and frugal. You will find among them some elegance, per

If the Colonies (hould alfume governments separately, they
should be left entirely to their own choice of the forms, and if a
Continental Constitution (hould be formed, it Ihould be a Con

viz. war, trade, difputcs between Colony and Colony, the Polt-
Officc, and the unappropriated lands of the Crown, as they used
to he called. .
These Colonies, under such forms of government, and in such a
union, would be unconquerable by all the Monarchies of Europe.

Dr. Price, in his Resolution Sermon, afterre
probating, in pointed terms, adulation to men in
power as Jebafing to those who offer, and corrupt
ing to those who receive it, observes, " It is a
trite observation, that extremes generally beget
one another : This is particularly true in the
present cafe. Persons justly informed on the fub
jecfl ot government, when they lee men dazzled
by looking up to high stations, and observe loyal
ty carried to a length that implies ignorance and
servility ; such persons, in such circumftar.ces,
are in danger of Ipurningat all public authority,
and throwing off that refpe<stful demeanor to per
sons inverted with it, which the order of society
requires. There is undoubtedly a particular de
ference and homage due to civil magiffrates, on
account of their ftationsand offices ; nor can that
man be either truly wife, or truly virtuous, who
despises government, and wantonly f(eaks evil of
his rulersâor who does not by all the means in
his power endeavor to strengthen their hands,
and to give weight to their exertions in the dis
charge of their duty."
TREASURY DEPARTMENT, Sept. 28, 1790.

be advanced for the purchafeof materials and provisionsÂ»
