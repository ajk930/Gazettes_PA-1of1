TN they.dft of thfffe irrefolntions, the Kind

g-,".c tutvi : .-n;.n ;o Crleahs. Tliele Lords re
inonftrated to tliem, that an AHembly lb refpeft
able, and which occasioned Co great an expcncc
to the King and the nation, had not been called
but on their account, and to fatisfy their com
plaints anil demands : 1 hat they were there to
deliberate oi! the means ot reforming the govern
ment, and appealing the disputes of religion ;
matters of so high importance, that they could
not be decided, without the ptefence and con
currence of the Princes of the blood. That if
the Princes of Bourbon, after having so often de
manded the reformation ofthe government, and
an examination of the cause of the Hugonots, re -
fufed to aflift at the States allenibledÂ°for tliofe
purposes, it would seem that they meant to trifle
with the King, and insult the mijefty of an as
sembly which reprcfented the body ofthe nation.
That they ought hereafter, to impute to thein
felves alone, their exclusion from dignities and
governments, since they had nor deigned to come
and receive the authority which the King ap
peared dilpofed to grant them, with the concur
rence of the Stares. 'I hat this condudt proving
their little attachment to the service of the King,
and the good of the kingdom, they ought not to
be fur prized if the firmelt refolutiona (hoiild be
taken to extirpate the feeds of discord, and ma
nifeft designs to disturb the state. That if the
King was disposed to reward such as gave him
proofs of their obedience and fidelity, he was
i J 1 â  *â¢* ,v- ti iwuva Â«/ui .a*
ceflhry fubmiflion, those who should attempt to
refill his will, and cxcite revolts in the cities and
Provinces of his kingdom; a crime of which he
would fufpecft tlie Princes of Bourbon, as long as
they should neglert to juftify themselves, and
their absence and obstinacy should confirm, the
injurious reports which were spread concerning
them. That hitherto neither the King nor his
Council, had given credit to them ; but that the
King desired that, for the honor of the royal
blood, the Princes would give proofs of their
fidelity and of their zeal for the good ofthe state,
and would juftify the sincerity of their intenti
ons in the eyes of France, whole attention was
attracted and fixed by the aflembly of the States.
These representations made little iinpreliion on
the Prince of Cond<?, who was resolved not to
risque his person, in a place where his enemies
could do all things. But his firmnefs was, in the
end, constrained to bend under the neceflity.
Cruflol returned to court, with an account of the
aversion of the Prince, to come to the States.
The Guises advjfed to employ force to determine
him. The Queen did not oppose it : and the
King took the resolution to constrain them by
force of arms. To this end they fend de Ther
mcs into Gafcony, and began to form under his
command, an army contpofed ofGendarmary and
al I the Infantry distributed in the neighbouring
Provinces.
The Bourbons were without troops, destitute
ef every thing, /hut up in Beam, a little Province
at the foot of the Pyrennees, wedged in between
France and Spain. They doubted not, that if, on
the one handthe troops of the King afl'em b led in
Gafcony, and on the other, those of the King of
Spain, who ardently wiftied to invade the feeble
remains of Navarre, ftiould attack them, they
fliould easily be subjugated and stripped of their
dominions. The infurredtions which the Prince
ofCondc had excited in France, had been attend
ed with no fuccef,. He was in Beam without
troops and without money. The King of Na
varre who would not expose the reft of his llates,
nor his wife and children, whom he had about
him, yielded to neceflity, more powerful than
any Counsels, and finally determined his brother
on thejourney to Orleans, in the general persua
sion, tiiat, especially during the fefiion of the
States, the ministry would not take any violent
resolution againftthem ; whereas, by obstinately
remainingat Beam, they would expose themselves
to the infamy which always accompanies the name
of rebels, and ruin tlieinfelves without resource.
The Cardinal of Bourbon, their brother, contri-

Alas I fly ! his presence pains my foul,
And love, and black despair, each rending thought controul.

Even rocks, yvith sympathy, behold me weep,
And tears refponfivc, flow adown the craggy deep.
But why! ah whv do I complain !
Why tell my paflion to the world in vain !
All hope of happiness is fled ;

Then fliould my numbers roll sublime along,
And all my paiDon glow amidst the long.

Slow as the fad funereal hearle,
The tale should sadly flow.
Or if foft pity, e'er diftreft'd

And learn her yielding foul to feel.
Or if reviving hope (hould smile,
And spread foft alluring wile ;
Gaily I'd raifc the lively lay,
In wanton measure flap, and wildly fly away.
Or if cold frufty fear my bread should fill,
And each young joy, each budding transport chill ;

And deep dcfpondeuce drown the dying dirge of love.

ALMANZOR,
An account of th e ka mo us Gf.r ma n Gene-
ral LAUDOHN, lately deceased.-
GENERAL Laudohn died the 14th of July
last at Neuditfchein about two in tlie morn
ing, in consequence of 9 retention of urine, witii
which he was attacked 011 the Bth of June. His
death was supposed to be haltcned by his refufal
to have the neceflary cataplasms applied, before
the operation ot the pundlure which his furgeoi.s
were obliged to perform ; the consequence was
a fever, and inflammation of the bladder, which
carried liiin off. fie died ir. the 74th year ot his
age
The body was conveyed to Vienna to be in
terred ac Haderfdorf, in a vault which he built
himfelf in the pariOi church there.
Uen. Laudohn was born in 1716, and was a
native of Livonia. He made his firft cam pain
under Marftial Munich in the war of 1738, be
tween the Ruffians and thf 2'urks. He was at
the raking ofOczakow, Choczim, and Stawntf
chame, where the Turks were entirely defeated.
Frederic the great refufed in 1741 to take
young Laudoh m into his fervites, laying he did
not like his countenance: though this monarch,
who was conftdered as the greatest general of
his age, said, that lie often admired
the positions of other generals, but that he ever
dreaded the battles of Laudohn-
In the year t 756, when but just entered into
the (ervice of the House of Austria, with thera'.ik
of Lieutenant Colonel, he made such rapid pro
grcfs, that within less than a year, he was gene
ral of the Artillery, and within three years,
Commander in chief of the whole army.
He rescued Olniutz whenbefieged by the Prtif
fians, beat the King himfelf at Frankford upon
the Oder, and at Zoudorfftook general
prisoner, carried Glatz and Schweldnitz by as
sault and flopped the progress of Frederic in a
w,r wh-rb rti'gV bnvÂ» n ov? f-rr.l :u 'he hr. ,r..
of Aoftria.
In the year i 775, when elevated to the rank
of JVlarflial, at the head of 60,000 men, he hin
dered Henry, brother to the King of Prussia
from joining his army to that of the King.âSo
high was his reputation, that Frederic used to
fay, he feared nobody so much as ;
and at Dubicza, Novj, Gradifca, and Belgrade he
had but to present himfeM" before the place and
fay with Cefar, Kfni, vidi, vici. Th 2 command
of the army is given for the present to Field Mar-
Ihal Count Colleredo.

The anfmer of the President of the National AJtmbly,
to the 600 Deputies of the National Guards of
France.
Gentlemen,
At the moment in which absolute power ceased
to exist, by the liberation of twenty-five millions
of men from the fetters of defpotiim, it was an.
objetft of jufl apprehension, that the invaluable
blelfings of liberty would be loft, and anarchy
prevail; at that awful crills, the National Guards
appear, and France fees in them the defenders
of National liberty.
What functions, Gentlemen, can be so great
and noble ?âThe Jove of your country is at once
the motive and recompense of your labours.
What duty is so ufeful or honourable ? To
watch over the persons and properties of your
fellow citizensâto give to tbem that confidence
of their own security, without which 110 liappi
nefs can existâto promote the free tranfportati
0111Â° j â¢ ? ra ,' n ' corn > & c -and to fiipprefs tumults
and disorders among the people and, above
all, to enforce the collection of the taxes, with
out which no nation can exift_ A Ã E obligations,
of the strongest kind. The National A trem
bly know, Gentlemen, that you fulfil them in all
points.âl hey have made repeated declarations
ot their confidence in your patriotism They

the love, the gratitude of your fellow citizens.
You have exerted your utmost endeavours to re

vours have been crowned with success. It will

â¢ hey shall transmit to their fucceftors, the talk of
preserving that majefticfabric, the French conflitu
lion, which we are hastening to comoleat.

[Whole No. isj.]THE ADDRESS,
Qffired to the National A[fembly oj France, in the name
of the citizens of the United States of America, on
the 10th oj "July, 1 790, by Mijfrt Barlow, Jones,
Black don, Swan, Vernon, Aptleton, Hud
â VTE L L, J A RV lS,a/ldG. WASH t N'GTO N GREENE.
gentlemen,
r "l~ , HEcitizens of the United States of America
J- now resident in Paris, (truck with admira
tion at the developement and extension of their
own principles in your great country, beg leave
to approach the holy altar of liberty, and ex
press to the national afTembly that ardent grati
tude and profound relpect, which are due to the
fathers of the nation and the benefaiftorsofinan
kind. The rays of the western liar, diffufed
from a diitant portion of the globe, are now met,
and reverberated by that riling fun of glory,
which floods with light the dominions of France,
and begins to illuminate the world.
Irrefutable is the energy of truth ; and the ce
lerity of her progress transcends calculation.
We believed, and we earneltly wished, that the
bleflings of liberty might oneday beunderitood ;
that the nations might rouse from their lethargy,
and aflert the rights us men, in a voice that men
could not refill. We believed that enormous lux
ury and domination would be disrobed of their
unnatural charms ; that arbitrary kings and ru
lers, thole gods of the earth, would be reduced to
renounce their idolatrous diltindtions, to mingle
with their fellow freemen, and rejoice in the fe
licity of the race. We believed, that religion,
themildeft daughter of heaven, would one day
divert herfelf of the borrowed terrors of intoler
ance, and change the sword of slaughter, to the
fceptrc of peace. We now behold thofc events
tnoft altonifhingly accelerated ; and we feel a
dignifying fatista<flion, a new and unspeakable
pleasure, in Handing before this venerable holt
of the heroes of humanity, who have contended
v-jth so much fucccefs in the field of truth and on
the heights of virtue.
May your efforts and achievements be recom
pensed with aiteflations of an applauding consci
ence, and the bleflings of a grateful country ; and
may the patriot king, who has i'o generously fa
crificed with you on the common altar of the pub
lic weal, amply partake with you in all tbofe re
wards which gratify the good and exalt the great.
The Monarch who began his youthful career
bv extending fuchfignal a<fts of heneficencc to a
dillant Ration, then ltruggling to be free, was
worthy to rejoice in thus voluntarily exchanging
the splendours of prerogative, and the rod of
despotism, for the homage of freemen, and the
love and gratitude of fellosv citizens. In the ac
clamations of regenerated France, he may in
deed be called the firit King of the French ; but
in the language of theextolling universe, he will
be lliled the firftKing of men.
And now, Gentlemen, we have but one request
to make..âWe beg leave to enjoy the honor of
afliltingat that augull ceremony which promises
to perpetuate the happiness of France. When
the fiien of your nation, in our country, fought
and bled with us under the itandard of freedom,
they tauglu us to love them. At the present
moment, when the ellablifhuient.of principles
here, funilar to our own, invigorates the bonds of
our union, and attach us to yon by new ties that
dignify and strengthen society, exulting in your
political elevation, we hail you brothers and fel
low citizens ! and our hearts overflow with the
foft fentimetits of a more endeared amity.
At the foot of the fame altar where the repre
sentatives and soldier-citizens of a great empire
fliall take the oath ol fidelity to the nation, the
law, and the King, we iliould fwe ir an eternal
friendftiip to the Frenchâyes, gentlemen, to all
the French who remain faithful to the princi
ples which you have consecrated ; for, like you,
we cherish liberty ; like you, we love peace.
THE PRESIDENT'S ANSWER
It was by aiding you in the acquisition of free
dom, tliat the French learned to know it, and to
love it. The hands that have broken the /hac
kles of freedom are not made to wear them.â
The French nation in this relpetfl, indeed, more
fortunate than rhe American, owes her victory to
the virtue and pntruotifni of her King ; while seas
ofblood were the pricc ofyours. Courage burlt
aliunder your chainsâre;ifon has difl'olved our's.
Your country was the firll throne of libertyânow
Jliefupports herfelfontlie two worlds.
At the fcaft, which will give to the liniverfe
an affeifting fpeftacle of a great union of friends;
The Allembly will rejoice to fÂ°e tlie*citizens of
the United States of America, who now prefer;t
themselves before us. Let us 11 ill be brothers,
and let the two nations form but one great peo
ple.

A seaman, a few'days since, fell over the fide
of the Alligator frigate at Sheernefs :âCaptain
Coffin, the commander beheld, from the man's
(icuation, that he mutt perish if not inftanily re
lieved ; and we mult add, to the honor of this of
ficer, that he did not pause a moment, but leaped
from the quarter deck, with his uniform and boots
on, and rescued the poor fellow from being
drowned, âat the imminent rilk of hij own kfc !
Well may a Sailor boldly dare,
And ardent follow martial (trife ;
For when with death himfeli at war,
He in a Coffiv meets with life.
Our falhionable fair seem, by universal consent,
to have discarded heels from their shoes ; this is
one of the very raijp examples in which appear
ance is facrificed to Conifort. <

NEW WAY TO BORROW MONEY
A FARMER 111 Cumberland made his will, and
in coming home, feetningly from market, he
loft it at the doer of a very rich old fellow,
whose whole thoughts were running upon mo
ney. The old fellow found it at his gate, and
began to read it. He there found the farmer
was giving jool. to this person, and ioool. to ano
ther, and a farm, in a diitant county, to the third.
The old man went in and said " Aye, aye !
I always thought this fellow knew how to look
about him."
lu a few days tlie farmer came to tell himâ
" That he was about to set up a manufactory ;
and if he could lend him 5001. it would much
oblige him." Tke old fellow, who had the will
in hit head, complied, without liefitation.
11l a few days afterwards the fellow broke, and
tlie old man, oil enquiry, found iliac the will was
au entire fabrication, and had been dropped at
his gate on purpose.
July 26.
On the Sunday subsequent 10 the day of the
National Federation, Sunday being the chosen
day for mirth and feftivity in Roman Catholic
countries, a grand feftival was given in Paris by
the Municipality, or COl porarion, to the Depu
ties from all the oilier parts of France.
It began by a review of the National Guards
of Paris, and was followed by a public dinner at
the Corn Market, called Le Halle du Hi, which
is an inimenfe Rotunda, covered with glass, shjd
with galleries all round. The Hotel de Richhcit,
which has extensive gardens, was also employed
for this fete, and in the evening, that which par
ticularly dilHngui/hed this joyful feaft, was a
grand ball in the interior Court of the late Baf
tile : the whole of the ruin was surrounded by a
rail, and at the principal entrance there was a
transparency with the following inscription :
" hi l'on danfe aujourd'hui."
They now dance Hers.
No carriages of any kind were permitted to ap
pear in the street on that day.
In the afternoon there was a Regatta on the ri
ver, which was very splendid, but in which there
was an accident of the oTerturning of one boat,
by which four persons weredrowned. Thercwas
to have been an aerostatic exhibition after the re
view, but the balloon burst. *
Aug.* 6. Should the present negociation with
Spain finally succeed, it will then be expected
that our cabinet ftiould explain, why an expen

vantages have been obtained to counterbalance
the expence ?
Crowns and Diadems, from present appearan
ces, will soon go a begging through Europe. It
is certain that Leopold, Kmperor of Germany
has refufed the crown of Hungary, in consequence
of their deputies having on the i 3th of July pre
sented him 24 articles to sign which he could not
r<;lifli. He read them over, and positively refu
fed to put his name to them, notwithstanding
all the solicitations of the deputies, to whom he
declared that he was not at all anxious to be
crowned in Hungary, and that he had given or
ders to recall tliofe who had been sent to prepare
for the coronation.4â It is evident he is not so fo

riiercwere two men ordered for execution on
last Saturday, one lor a rape, the other for a high

the latter respited, and it is expected will be par
doned 011 account of his youth. Now molt o;'
the newlpapers have taken the liberty of liahg
ing both, regardless of the (aid respite. Ul' '~
lias not the unhanged gentleman a good action
for a libel, or would he be nonfuitedon the plea
of Lord Mansfield's repu:*d docftrine, " The

being true that the man was hanged, as the laid

Yesterday Lieut. Macgnire was made Pofi Cap-,

The people of Brabant appear to be determin

and declared Generalissimo.

accounts, wear a louring afpe<ft The armaments
of England, Spain, and the King of Sardinia are
supposed 10 have fonie refereuce to the posture
ofaffai i s in that country.
Letters from France announce an expedied
change in the French ininiftry : Mr, Necker
having cleared himfelf from the aspersions of M.
Camus, who charged him with embezzling 600
millions of livres, thinks the pre feu t a favorable
opportunity of retiring. M. St. Prielfc Hands
publicly charged with being privy to all the plots
for a counterrevolution. M. de la Tourdu Pin,
hasexcited suspicions by weakening the garrisons
on the frontiersâand has been severely handled
by the committee militaire. The Keeper of the
Seals, the Archbilhop de Bourdeaux is charged
with remifsnefs in not forwarding the Decrees of
the National Aflembly to the diilant provinces.
M. de Montmorin is Unown to be a friend to the
revolution ; but his silence for fix weeks respect

The King of the French lias lately been indis
posedâbut he is so far recovered as to have loft
every lymptom of fever.
The Baron de Bender, the Austrian General,
having presented to the King of the French, a re
quell for liberty to inarch the Aultrian troops thro
a part of France, obtained the King's consent, a
gieeable to ancient ufuage eftabliihed between
the two Rations : This being communicated to
the National Aflembly, they decreed that conform
ably to the deeree of 28th of Feb. lafl, foreign troops
Jhall not be permitted to march through the French
territories, except they be authorised by a Decree of the
Legislature, fantlioued by the King ; therefore the
orders ijfued from the War Office, and sent to the
Cotnmanders in the name of the King, jhall be confi'
dered as null and of no force.

The press was generally what is called hot or
the river yesterday-evening. The oldest water
men don't know what to make of this business ;
they lay, " that a peaceable negociation looks
lik# a preparation for war."
The coffee house politicians are all thrown
outâfor lec-theni talk as cooly as they will about
peace over their cups, the next morning they

Lait week a perron of Exeter drowned in a

Spain âAs a proof that the mod defpoticand
the inoft ignorant countries cannot ltop ilie pro
greflivc force of freedom, it is the custom to tic
paftjuinades, and other articles of information,
to the tails and necks of dogs, who are immedi
ately set a running, and thus carry satire into the
very Palace. What adds to the joke is, that these
dogs cannot be prosecuted.
In addition to this folly, which had never hap
pened, had the government been a sensible one
âthe inquKition had the folly to name all the
jjrints, pamphlets, and other publications which
were forbidden. This of course served as an
advertisement, to make people ten times more
curious than they were before ; and that spirit,
and true uwierjlanding which the Press alone-Â»an
give, are lifing fact over the dreary ruins of def
potifin.
The following are the particulars of the attempt to
tijfajjinatc Count Florida Blanch, the Span
ish Minister.
The Count in his way to his official apart
ments in the Palace, about ten o'clock in the
niorninz. was atiackfd by a wietch, wlw> nv>dq a.
ltroke at him behind, with a dagger. 'The force
of this ftioke was fortunately parried by '.he
Count turning suddenly round. This moveniinr,
with the refinance the dagger encountered from
liis cloaths, contributed tofave him. The villain,
however, not fatisfied with one stroke, aimed a
J'econd at the Count, though surrounded with
centinels and his own servants ; but, before he
had effected his lait purpose, one of the Count's
servants fejzed the monster by the hair, and
brought him to the ground. The Minister's
wounds were immediately examined, and found
to be flight and without danger. He was after
wards let blood, and had some repose, and is now
pronounced to be out of danger. Theaffaflin be
ing laid flat, and having 101 l the arm with which
he committed the daring ait, drew out his other
hand fixnn his pocket, and gave hiuifelf two
blows, which are not mortal. The account gi
ven of the man is, that he had been formerly a
j'urgeon at Buenos Ayres from whence return
ing poor, he had formed many impracticable
schemes, which he had submitted to the Minister,
who had uniformly rejected them, as visionary
and absurd. These disappointments had affected
his intellects. His vengeance was not, it feenis,
levelled against the Count in particular, but
agaii.lt all the Ministers ; and the Count, hap
pening to come firft in his way, became the ob
ject of it. The least veltigeof conspiracy has not
been traced ; and, from the assassin's known clia
ra<ter before, he is pronounced a maniac, ft is
not certainly known whether he it '4 Frenchman
or a Spaniard. Some fay his name is Paul Perret,
others Paul Pt-ez.
Study furni/hes us with a thousand ways to
(Jifpel that uneasiness which makes us unhappy.
A mind that is employed easily forgets many
things which would make a stronger impreflwn
upon it, if it was idle. The grievances of Ae
body are also relieved by study ; for the appli
cation of the mind to certain objerts which please
it, hinder it from perceiving the necessities of the
body. Even old-age, after a life spent iu study,
does not ili fcover its infirmities by the
llble symptoms which, reduce us, as it were, to
childhood. It comes on without being perceived,
â we stoop under it insensibly ; but, though at last
we drop into the grave, we do not fall into it all
at once. Thus did Boerhaave, and
Peaufobre pass their old age, and thus the illuf
tt ions Fontenelle. The greatest men among the
ancients improved their undvrftanding to the last.
Sophocles computed tragedies till he was exceed
EXTRACT
ing old ; and it Is fa id that he was not less than
an hundred when he wrote his Oedipus. His
children, finding that the application he gave to
his plays made him negledt his family affairs,
commenced a fait of lunacy against him ; but
Sophocles made no other defence than the recit
ing the tragedy of OedipuÂ«, ,whith he had just
finiJhed, before proper judges of the drama ; and,
having then aflced them whether they thought
the play was the composition of a man that had
101 l his reason, he was acquitted of the charge.

Ihe reflections that croud on the philanthropic mind, in con
templating this account, are painful to the highest degree : Vice,
milery and distress, in every form, are the wretched etfeas of this
remnant of feudal and aristocratic tyranny. It is astonishing that
amidlt the numerous improvements which are daily takingÂ°place
in legifljtion, the abolition of this barbarous custom has not been
effedted : 41 to prevent the r 'ppofed neceflity of throwing the body
of a fellow citizen into goal for debt, let a law be parsed which
shall place the risk of credit wholly upon the lender of money,
or the feller goods, unless real security be given for the debt,
in which cafe nothing shall be demanded, or taken, but the said
security : By means of such a law much extravagance would be
prevented ; labor would be encreqfcd ; honor and character would
be cultivated, and become estimable, for these would be the only
means of obtaining credit without real security: It is certainly
worth while to try the experiment."
How common is the word honor ! How little understood ! How
often prostituted ! It occurs no where more frequently than at "a
gaming table ; where, at the fame time, everv thought, and every

dishonorable than to pollefs the property of another without a
compensation. It may be fafely afTeited that it requires great
practice to steel the bosom against that conscious injustice, of
which every lucky noviciate in the art of gaming is fufceotible ;
habit alone can blunt and obliterate the sense of honor which is
congenial to our natures ; and this principle is totallyeradicated
in time from the m nd of a gamhler.

THE following regulations, which have been adopted towards
carrying into execution the aCt, making provi(ion for the
debt ot the United States, are announced for the information ot
the public creditors.
â¢ WHEN a transfer is to be made from one person to another, the
Certificate or certificates of the debt to be transferred, mull be pio
riu cd at the proper office, in order that the fame may be can
celled, and a new one, or new ones issue, as the cafe (hall require.
When a transfer is desired from one office to appli
cation mud in the firft instance be made at the office where the
<JVedit exists, whereupon the certificate or certificates of the debt
to be transferred will be cancelled, afict a special one granted, as a
voucher to the Secretary of the Treasury ; upon the production
and delivery ot which to him, a warrant will Hlue to the office,
to which thf debt is to be transferred, where the business will be
completed. The form (A) at foot heteof, has been adopted for
letters of attorney, to make transfers, whlcn, and the directions
for completing it, it is expcClcd will be carefully observed.
In every cafc of a transfer of the fubferibed or funded debt, the
new certificate will bear inured, only from the fir ft day ot the
quarter, in which the transfer is made. The unpaid interest which
may have accrued prior to that quarter, will be paid only to the
person, who was ftockholdcr at the time it accrued, or to his spe
cial aflignee.
Fourteen days before the expiratiop of cach quarter, the books
of cac!i office will heclofcd so that no transfers w'fl be made,
nor, except at the Treasury, will any fubferipttons be received,
or o!d certificate? exchanged for new ones, on the application ot
non-fubferibers, during that period. Those intending to become
fubferibers to the proposed Loan, who do not fubferibe, prior to
the commencement of any such periodâor those intending not to
fubfefibe, who do not their old certificates to be exchang
ed, or if holdeis of certificates of the Register ot the Treasury,
who do not notify to theTreafurv their intention not to fubferibe,
prior to such commencement of such period, will not receive the
i ntereft, which may have accrued antecedently, 'till the evd of
the quarter in which their fubferiptions arc made, or in which their
certificates areexchang d,or in which they ftiall lo notify their in
tention not to fubferibe. This, the proper distribution of the
funds, and the preservation of order render iod if pen Cable.
On the fubferibed or funded debt, interest as it becomes due,
will be paid without production of the certificates ilfued for the
fame. On the unfubfcribed debt, if any there (hall be, the pro
duction of the certificates will be nectffary, in order to the receipt
of the interest, and an indorsement of the payment of it upon the
certificates. This however, in consideration of the rifle and incon
venicnce of tranfiniflion, will not be required of those who hold
certificates of tlic Register of the Treasury, and reside out of the
United States. The form (B) at toot he eof, ot a letter of attor
ney for receiving interest, and the directions therewith, it is ex
pected will be carefully pursued.

TREASURY DEPARTMENT, Sept. 28, 1790.
NOTICE is hereby given, that propofaW will be received at the
Oifice ol the Secretary of theTrcafury, until the 31ft day
ol December next incluftve, for the building of a LIGHT HOUSE,
neatly of the dimentions proposed by the late Commiffioneu of
Virginia and Maryland, upon the lot of land oil Cape Henry, in
the County ot Princefj Ann, and State of Virginia, lately ceded for
that purpolc to the United States. It is desired, that the proposals
may leave the elf&ion, whether the building above the foundation
