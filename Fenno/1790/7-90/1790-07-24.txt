DISCOURSES ON DAVILA No. XV.
(Concluded Jrom our lufi.)
First follow nature and your jud*ment frame
By her just standard which isftill the fÂ»me.
AMERICANS ! In your Congress at Philadel
phia,on Friday,the 14th day of Oft. 1 you
laid down the fundamental principles, for which
you were about to contend,and from which it 13 >to
be hoped you will never depart. For aliening and
vindicating your rights and liberties, you declar
ed, '' 1 hat by the immutable laws of nature, the
" principles of the English Constitution, and
" your several charters or compacts, you were
" entitled to life, liberty and property : that
" your ancellors were entitled to all the rights,
" liberties and immunities of free and natural
" born fubjdeits in England: that you, their de
" fcendants, were entitled ro the exercise and
" enjoyment of all such of them as your local
" and other circuinftances, enabled you toexer
" cife and enjoy. That the foundation of En
" glifh liberty, and of all free government, is,
a right in the people, to participate in their
" legislative council. That you were entitled
" t6 the common law of England, and more ef
" pecially to the great and inestimable privilege
" of being tried by your peers oi" the vicinage,
" according to the course of that law. That it
" It indispensably necejfary togood government, ar.d
" rendered essential by the Englijh Confutation, that
" the conjlitueilt branches of the legislature, betr.de
" fender oj each ether." These, among others,
you then claimed, demanded and infilled on, as
your indubitable rights and liberties. These
are the principles, 011 which you firft united and
aflociated, and if you lleadily and consistently
maintain them, they will nbt only secure free
dom and happiness to yourselves and your poste
rity, but ydur example will be imitated by all
Hurops, and in time perhaps by all mankind.
The nations are in travail and great ?*enrs piuit
have birth. " The minds of men are in move
ment from the 801 iithenes to the Atlantic. Agi
tated with new and llronir emotions, they swell
and heave beneath bppreiiion, as the seas within
the polar circle, atthe approach of spring. The
genius of philosophy with the touch of Ithuriel's
spear, is trying the eftabliflinientt bf the earth.
The various forms of prejudice, superstition and
servility, start up, in their true lliapes, which
had long imposed upon the world, under the re
vered feuiblances of honor, faith and loyalty.
Whatever is loose mult be shaken ; whatever is
corrftpted inuft be lopt away ; whatever is not
built on the broad balls of public utility, mull
be thrown to the ground. Obscure murmurs ga
ther and swell into atempell ; the spirit of en
quiry like a severe and searching wind, pene
trates every part of the great body politic ; and
\vhatever is unsound, whatever is infirm, fhriuks
Ar the visitation. Liberty, led by philosophy,
diffuses her blelfings to every class of men ; and
even extends a finile of hope and proniife to the
poor African, the victim of hard impenetrable
avarice. Man, as man, becomes an objet r tof re
fpeift. Tenets are transferred, from theory to
practice. The glowing sentiment, the lofty fpe
culat.loll, no longer fer\e " but to adorn the pag
es of a book they are brought home to men's
bulincfs and bosoms ; and what fume centuries
ago, itw;is daring but to think, and dangerous
to express, is now realized and carried into effect.
Syfletns are analysed .into their firft principles,
iuid principles are fairly pursued to their legiti
mate consequences."
This is all enchaining.âBut amidst our enthu
fiafinâ there is great reason to paul'e, and pre
serve our sobriety. It is true that the firft em
pire of the world is breaking the fetters of hu
man reason, and exerting the energies ofredeem
td liberty. In the glowing ardors of her zeal,
ihe condescends, Americans, to pay the molt
fcrupolous attention to your maxims, principles
and example. There is reason to fear/he has co
pied from you, errors, which have cost you very
dear. Affilt her, by your example, to redtify
then before they involve her in calamies, as
much greater than as her population is
jnore unwieldy, and licr lituation more exposed
to the baleful influence of rival neighbours.
Ainidlt all their exultations, Americans and
Frekciimen Ihoula remember, that the perfec
tibility ot man, is only human and terreftial per
ieitibility. Cold will Hill freeze, and fire will
never cease to burn : disease and vice will conti
nue to disorder, and death to terrify mankind.
SATURDAY, JULY 24, 1790.
Emulation next to felf preservation will forever
be the great spring of human acftions, and the
balance of a well ordered government, will alone
be able t-o prevent that emulation from degene
rating into dangerous amotion, irregular rival
ries, deftru<Sive factions, wafting feJitions and
bloody civil wars.
The great queftior, wi/i forever remain, -who
Jhall work f Our ; r _. cannot all be idle.
Leisure for study must evt? be the portion of a
tew. Ihe number employed in government,
mult forever be very final) * Food, raiment and
habitations, the indifpenfihle wants of all, are
not to be obtained without the continual toil of
ninety-nine in an hundred of mankind. As reft
is rapture to the weary man, those who la
bor little will always be envied by thole who la
bor much, though the Tatter, irj reality, be pro
bably the most enviable. With all the encou
ragements public and private, which can ever be
given to general education, and it is fcarcelypof
(ible they iliould be too many or too great, the
laboring part of the people, can never be learn
ed. The controversy between the rich and the
poor, the laborious,and the idle, the learned and
the ignorant, diftinfttons as old* as the creation,
and as exteniiveas the globe ; diftintftions which
no art or policy, no degree of virtue or philoso
phy can ever wholly destroy, will continue, and
rivalries will spring out of therri. These parties
will be represented in the leglflature, and must
be balanced, or one will oppress the other.
There will never probably fce found, any other
mode of eftablilhing fucli an equilibrium, than
by constituting the representation of each, an
independent branch of the legislature, and an
independent executive authority, such as that in
our government, to be a thin! branch and a me
diator or an arbitrator I><- ween them. Property
must be lecured, or libc " cannot exist : but if
unlimited, or unba/anniij poÂ»v r of, difpciÂ£ng
property, be put into the hands of thole/ -who
have 110 property, France will find, as We hnvt;
round, the lamb committed to the custody of the
wolf. In such a care, all the pathetic exhorta
tions and addrefles of the National Allenibly to
the people, to refpecft property, will be regarded
110 more than the warbles of the fonglters of the
sorest. The great art of lawgiving coufills in
balancing the poor again ft the rich, in the legis
lature, dnd in constituting the legislative, a per
fect balance against the executive power, at the
fame lime, that no individual or party can become
its rival. The ellence of a free government con
sists in an effertfal controul of rivalries. The
executive and the legislative powers are natu
rally rivals : and if each, has not an effectual
controul over the other, the weaker, will ever
be the lamb in the paws ot the wolf. The nation
which will not adopt an equilibrium of power,
must adopt a despotism. There is 110 other al
ternative. Rivalries must Le controuled, or they
will throw all things into confufion : and there
is nothing but despotism, or a balance Â©f power,
which can tontroul them. Even in the simple
monarchies, the nobility and the judicatures,
constitute a balance, though a very imperfe<ft one
against the royalties.
Let us conclude witji one reflection more>
which shall barely be hinted at, as delicacy, if
not prudence, may require in this place foine
degree of relerve. Is there a poflibility, that the
government of nations may fall into the hands
of men, who teach the molt disconsolate of all
creeds, that men are but fireflies, and that this
all, is without a father ? Is this the way, to make
man, as man an object of refpeit ? Or is it, to
make murder itfelf, as indifferent ss /hooting a
plover, and the extermination of the Rohilla na
tion, as innocent, as the swallowing of mites, 011
a morsel ofcheefe ? If fuchacafe lhould happen,
would not one of these, the most credulous of all
believers, have reason to pray, to his eternal na
ture, or his almighty chance, (1 he more absurdity
there is in this address the more in character)
give us again the gods of the Creeksâgive us again
the more intelligible as well as more comfortable fyf
tents of Athauajiui and Calvinânay y give us again
our Popes and Hierarchies, BenediÃines and IcfuitJ,
with all their fuperjlition and fanaticijm, 'mpoflurcs
and tyranny.âA certain Dutchefs of venerable
years and niafculine understanding, said of some
of the Philosophers of the eighteenth century,
admirably well, " On ne croit pas, dans le
" Chriftianifme, mais qii croit, toutes les fottifes

INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE COLOMES,
Presented to the National AJJtmily, in the name of
the Committee appointed for that pufpc/e, the 23d
March, 1790.
By Mr. Barnjvi, Deputy fiora Dauphiny.

' I ''HE National Afieinbly having pointed out
A the mode of forming die afiemblies, which
are to preiVnt the views of the colonies, is also
obliged to fix certain principles as a basis for their
plans of conftitutiofi, to render as as far as pofli
ble all iuch as may be offered fufceptable of be
ing received
But it is defi-ous to reduce its conditions to the
molt simple terms, to the most nnconteftable max
imsâ-and it does not wifhto add any thing which
may impofeany limits to the libei ty of the colo
nial afiemblies, beyond what conltitutes the fun
damental connexion beween tlie colonies and the
metropolis.
I he colonial afiemblies, engaged in the bufi
nefsof the Coiiftitution will perceive the distinc
tion between the legislative, executive, judiciary
and administrative functions ; they will exa
mine how it will best answer to organize the'iri
in the constitution of this colony f the forms,
according to which the legislative and executive
power ought to be exercised, the number, com
poution and hierarchy of the tribunals ; into
whole hands the administration ought to be in
truftt d, the number, formation and fubordina
ti-jn of the different afiemblies which ought to
concur therein ; the qualifications which may
be required to constitute an aiftive citizen, for
the purpose of exercising the different employ
ments ; in a Word, whatever may enter into the
composition of a government, the best adopted
to secure the happineft aud tranquility of the
colonies.
Tlie nature of their intcrefts, which can never
be entirely blended with those ofthe metropolis
locals and particularly objeasrcfpecfimg the pre
paration of their Jaws ; in short, the diltance of
places, and the time necellary to arrive at them
eftabliih a great difference between them and
the provinces of France, and consequently occa
fton a difference in their constitutions.
But in endeavouring to find these Out, we
ought never to lose fight that they form however
a part of the French empire, and that the pro
tection which is due them by the whole national
strength ; that the engagements which cutrhc
to exilt between them and the commerce "of
France ; in a word, that every tie of reciprocal
utility which attaches them to the metropolis
can have 110 kind of solidity, without the exist
ence of political connections to serve as a basis.
From these different views, it appears with re
fpectto the legislative power,
That the laws designed for the interior reg'j.
lation of the colonies, independent ofthe relati
ons which exifl between them and the metropolis
may and can be prepared without any difficulty
within tliemfelves. 3
That these laws when they are of a preffinr
nature, may be provisionally executed with the
lanction or the governor ;
But that the right of approving tliein defini
tively, should be reserved to the legislature of
rrance ana the King.
To the legifliiture, because it is inverted with
Â»he national power, and because it would be im
polnble without its participation, to be sure tha*
the laws prepared in the colony, would not in
terfere with the engagements contracted with
the metropolis.
To the King, because the fanttion of all the
functions of royalty, are attributed to liini over
the colonies as well as over all the other parts
or the r rench empire.
It in like manner follows, that the Jaws which
relpect the connections between the colonies and
the metropolis whether they are demanded by
the colonial Aflembly, or have been prepared in
the National Aliembly, ought to receive their
exiltence and authority from the latter, and can
not be executed, even provisionally until they
have been decreed by it. A maxim oflegiflatiort
which has 110 connection with momentary excep
tions, which pressing and imperious wants may
require, reflecting the introduction of provifi
011s. r
From the fame views refuits with regard ro
(tte
[Whole No. 134.Jfrom the fame, views result, with regard to
she Executive power.
Tlut it may be neceflary, in certain cases, that
the functions attributed to the King, throughout
-all the parts ofthe French empire, should be pro
niifctioufly exercised in the colonies, by a gover
nor who represents hiin..
That therefore the choice and installation of
officers, which are in his nomination, the appro
fcation neceflary for the execution of the decrees
ofthe administrative aflembliesâand the other
adts which require celerity, may be provisionally
afligned to this governor, under the positive re
ierve of the King's approbation.
But that, in the colonies, as in France,
liingis the only and Supreme Chief of the Execu-"
tive powerâthaoall the officers of justice, the
administration, the military forces, ought to ack
nowledge him as their chief-âand that all the
, powers attributed to royalty, in the French con-
only be exercised provisionally by
those he has charged with them, and definititely
by himfelf.
These principles being acknowledged, all the
â views which may concur in favor of the prolper
ity of the colonies, may be taken into conlidera
tion by the colonial aflemblies.
The French nation does not wish to exercise
over them any other inflikcnee than that of the
ties eftabliflied and cemented for the common
-utilityâit is in no wife jealous to eitabliih orpre
ierve the means of oppression.
What sources of prosperity are offered to the
patriotifni of the colonial aflemblies by the dif
ferent parts of the labor entrusted to them. The
eftablifliment of a simple judiciary order, fecur
inÂ®' to the citizens an impartial and piompt jus
tice, an administration committed to the hands
of those who are interefled in it, a plan of imports
iuited to their convenience, the forms of which
cannot be changed, and rhequamity can only be
regulated by the >ote of the colonial aflemblies
themselves
France, to which its commercial laws with the
â¢colonies ought to secure, with fonie benefit the
Teimbuvfenmnt of the expences, which it is obli
ged tofupport for their protection, does not con
sider their polleffion as a fifcal resource. 1 heir
particular imposts shall be confined to the expen
ds of their own government, they themselves
ihall propose the e)tab!i!limeiu mil proportion of
them.
France does Hot consider its colonics as the
means of juftifying avidity, of flattering the ty
ranny of foriie persons appointed to superintend
their ailminiftration âthe intereltsof the citizens
ought to be managed by themselves, and the ad
aminiilratiou can only be entrusted to such as
they have freely elected.
The essences of a complicated justice, the de
lays and artifices of chicanfcry, the removals oc
casioned bythe too refined spring of certain tri
bunals, cannot l'uit men continually engaged in
ianadvantageous cultivation, and the commerce
â of its produ&ionsâthe colonies therefore require
anore rigoropfly than the metropolis, a prompt
stdminiftration ot jnftice divested ot every means
of defpotifni and oppression.
There is then none of these views but which
the National Aflembly will adopt with fatisfa&ion
"whenever they shall be proposed to it by the co
lonial aflTembliesâbut, after having considered
"whatfuits the interior happiness of the colonies,
it remains to pay attention to their exterior in-
lererts
The National Allenihly exercises towards each
of thepartsofrhe I'rench empire tliedutiesvvhich
belong to the social body over all the members
B'iat compose it-.-every one finds in it the g'.iar
dian ofits interests and libertyâ every one is fub

The depositary of the most legitimate and most
imposing authorities, the nation which has char
ged it with the preservation ofits rights, has pla
ced at its dilpofal all the force necessary to gua
ranty them. It is then arigid duty, a sacred ob
ligation to maintain them without alterationâ
1. it tlie more inconteflable these rights are, so
.much the greater means has the uation which has
nmtrufted ihem, to support them, and so much the
3efs does it fait theaffembly which represents it,
Jo call to their alliftance the arms of weaknels
and of tyranny. A timid circumfpedion, a vain
xJiflimiilation, would dejbafs its character to a le

it ought then, in treating with the children of
the country, to forget for a moment, and lay aside
Jill the rights and all the powers which it is char,

cuss their interests with freedom, to attach them
to their duty by the sentiment of their own wel

it, that of reason and of truth.

" OntoardHit Ihusthi.S/. Pierre, June 15.
â¢' STffCE the begining of the troubles there has been a point
ed enmity between the tow* ofÂ». Pierre, and the colony, whicft
encreafed continually, fronUhe anarchy which reigned in that ci
ty. The 3d of June, after the usual procession.a quarrel took,
place between the free-coloured people, and a mob, which
natrd by the sudden slaughter of 15 mulattoes, and three of their
white officers. One hundred an<Tlwenty-feven mulattoes were af
terwards confined in Jail, and their puni(hment waÂ» infilled upon
by that unruly mob, which the Municipal body was not able to
restrain. Every citiren lamented the |progteilive oppression of a
gang of vilians which cftablifbed themselves in St. Pierre : And
that city, so important to commerce, was approaching to be the
haunt of vagabonds of all nations : Which event, had it arrived,
would have proved fatal to all the windward Iftands. In this
exigency, the colony held a special meetingâthe colonists united,
all the free coloured people armed themselves, and demanded thai
iuftice should be done ; even the slaves began to stir, and every
thing would have been in a deplorable fiwaiion there, if a fpeeoy
relief had noj been granted The Colonial Alfembiy having
therefore reqriefled the Viscount D* Damas to employ all the for
ces under his command, and to march to St. Pierre in order to e
liver that town from oppreflion, and to reilore the activity and
liberty of its commerce : And myfelC having also been equally ic
quelled, we thereupon agreed to mov<*on the bufinefs,the gth init.
by land and by water. The town "f Si. Pierre was loon surround
on every part, and taken poflfeflion of by our troops without firing
a single gun ; and every thing palled with the great-eft good order.
The Municipal body, and the citizens, being fatisficd, have pre
iented usaddreffes of thanks, which 1 have the honor to fend you.
41 In order to juftify the (laughter perpetrated the 3 inft. it was
ailed gcd that a plot had been laid by the hec-coloured people a
gainst the whites. Those who were put to jail remain th<*re and
their cafe will jbe legally fcmtitiized. The above is al l that has
taken place. We believe we have rendered an important service
to the Colony, to the Metropolis, and to their refpeftive com
merce : Especially as we have been io fortunate as to luccced in
thfs very dekcate operation without bloodlhed, and to the fatis
tad ion of all the citizens. 1 have the honor &c. See. (Signed)
" On board the llhiflre, Ju*s 17.
14 We have terminated our bufiucfs here and to-morrow wc
(hall go back to Fort-Royal, leaving at St. Pierre's a batalion, in
garrison, at the request of the ctizens. The greater part of the
disturbers have fled ; a part will be sent to France, and some vvill
be puniihed according to thejuftice of the laws : Some have been
punished bv a few days This important mi
litary enterprize has not cost a drop of blood. If we had denied
the request, the Colonics and the coloured people would have
executed that delicate piece of business without us ; and whatever
might have been the iflue, it woald have been fatal to the colony.
44 1 am now gowing to prepare for my departure for Franceâ
and ftiould be very sorry not to have it in my power to fee your
town again, where reside an Hancock, an Adams, a Bowdoin,
and a multitude of citizens, extremely affe&ionatc and amiable ;
to whom 1 am attached by the warmcft gratitude.
44 Farewell, dear, Sir, I reiterate to you always, with new plea

have avowed to you.

Here Mr. Parker was interrupted by several gentlemen calling
to order ; Mr. Smith of (S. C.) hoped-the gentleman might be
permiited to go 011âbut he would allure him he ihould at au
fwered.
Mr. Parker proceeded. I do not wish Mr. speaker, to take
up the time of the House, but I jpi strongly persuaded that in a
government like ours, in a question like this, the Senate (hould
be faiisfied to let the representatives of the people feletfc the place
*io(l convenient to the communitv at large ; for myfelf 1 declare
I have no pcrfonal objcftion to New-York, so far from >t that
was I to feleÂ£t a place to spend my own time, I (hould p~efcr it
10 Philadelphia; butas a representative of America, I have n>
right to consult mv private happiness nor overawe the
weal with it, my advocating a removal then cannot be afcrit-ed to
private views or felf-intercfted motives; what (Insulates toe is
the wilh of the people I represent and a conviflion of the prop
erty of the measure. When deliberating on a national of
great importance private wifh.s (hould be baqifhed and the com
mon cause cÂ«nfulted.
Gentlemen tell uÂ» there it no neceflity for prefling this question
at this time ; but fir, I think since we are embarked in it weoug'.l
to prosecute the voyage untiljwe arrive at that place, which will
restore union, harmony, and good humour ; even if we now re
linquifli the bufmefs we have no Security, but it will haunt us
and meet us at every turn. Hence I think, lir, there is an abso
lute neceflity of temoving immediately, if we wish the govern
ment to last, andtofome place from whence the legiflatuie ray
extend its influence in an equal and regular manner to all the ex
tremities ; the people know and feel its partial operation, and i:t
very uneasy under it.
Gentlemen fay we ought to determine the permanent refidtnee;
to me, fir, it is a matter of indifference which is lirll deternised,
permanent or temporary residenceâbut as a majority have refu
ted to consider of the permanent residence at this time, 1 am wik
ling to give up to their aesifion, and contend for the prefentoniy
for the temporary feat. I wilh this to be nearer the center of the
United States than it now is ; I repeat again, that whilst I have a
majority of the people and their reprefeutatives, I will tot re
linquish my endeavor toobtainwhat they desire with so much
anxiety and what they are entitled to on every principle of justice
and equity.
It is said that no petitions are come forward praying thts re
moval. I admitthere are noneâour constituents have confidence
in us, and could not suppose it ncceffary to trouble us with peti
tions, in order to induce us to adopt a measure, the propriety oÂ£
which rauft be obvious to every eye ; but if we now decline to
fatisfy their just desires, we may expect not only petitions, but
rcmovjlranccs against our culpablenegleÂ£V. When people feel what
it is to travel, cxhaufted with fatigue some hundred milts more
than an equal apportionment requires, they will not only cÂ° m "
plain of us, but will have reason to wurfe and execrate the authors
of their ca! .mities
Tue geÂ»i .emen from the Eastward may feel easy under eve'y
thing of this kind, whilst they remain in New-York; but the
foutfcefn gentlemen will be guilty of great inattention to the in*
tereii ot those they represent, if they remain any longer idle fpcc
tators of a game, by which their particular constituents only can
be looters. (From Lloyd's Minifies.)

" Conversation is the criterion oj a/most every man i
tutelicitv.al went."
WE arc often disposed to pay a compliment to
men for then abilities and retfitude, upon
a very flight and fuperficial acquaintance. 1 Ins
liafty mode of estimating characters expoies us to
a degree of deception, and makes us value some
too hi oh and others too low. ihe talents ot a
man, no more than his difpofitien can be aker
tained without a strict fertiuny, and being con
versant with him on ordinary occasions, and in
the familiar walks of life. While men are in the
mere exercise of profeffional duty, or are exam
ined only bv the view they exhibit when acting
in a public 'capacity, they aflame artificial lonns,
and display borrowed abilities.
Some porfons indeed have the addreft t0
their real character always out of fight. They
will never Â«pose themfelvesto the tulnefs ofdo
meftic infpsctio'.i, being persuaded that they' may
risque the loi's of reputation 111 private, which tl ej
have obtained in public. For this real on, it is pru
dent for men who have acquired some fame an
influence for their abilities, to adopt a c..utious,
reserved mode of conversation. hveiy pei 011
who indulges liimfelf in an unrestrained .cope o
conversation, will, in some moments of inadver
tency, difeover follies and weaknel es, which a
more discreet rule of behavior would have con
cealcd. It is of utility to mankind that some

On Saturday evening last Colonel MarinUS VV u

ty eight chiefs of the Creek nation arrived in this
city' They will shortly proceed to vilit the Con
gress of the United States, in order to conclude
treaties, which, we hope, will secure peace to our

by our citizens with every mark of attention.
The bells were rung ; the artillery fired a fede
ml salute, and with the light intantry companies
escorted the chiefs to the Indian Queen, where
lodgings were prepared for them ; and a great
number of people afl'einbled to behold the largelt
body of Indians, that has appeared in this metro

divine service at Christ church.

A correspondent observes, that the situation ot
the Poft-Office bill is truly critical.âThe Houte
of Representatives are strenuous to have Itxty
Pott-Matters'General.â The Senate are averse to
more than ONE.âBut the people being great
ly interested in this queftion> and the public
mind having anticipated and approved the plan
of SIXTYâit follows that the people are in a
fairway of having no new regulations at allâbnÂ«
at an expense greatly overbalancing the benefit.
If sixty Pott Matters' General are lixty tunes
better than one, the amendment of the Senate
to the Poft-Office bill isa most abominable unpo
pular amendment. .

prefnted by the Senators and Members of the
Houft-of Representatives from that Stat:
TO â THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES.
S I R,
the people of the St<Ueof South-CaroHna, now met ax.d
V V fitting in Convention, leave to addrclsyou, and to em
brace this firft opportunity which has been afforded us of congra
tulating you on the high and important station of Prcfident of the
-ntted States. Such, fir, has been the impreflion made upon the
public mind by a due sense of your eminent fcrvices, and such
the atFccliyn of a nation, wliofe dearest rights you have defended,
that one wish pervaded the whole continent of placing )ou at the
head ot the Federal Republic, and of enjoying under your pro
tection, as our firfl magistrate, the bleflings of that free govern
ment, for the attainment of which we are so much indebted to
your exertions as our general. The promises of your eailier life,
had prepared your fellow-citizens for your acceptance of the
military command in 1775, when dangers and difficulties sur
rounded us on all fiaes, arid the profpe6l was dark and gloomy; but
tfiey mult ever remember with gratitude and admiration the wif
<-om and energy ot that system, which could induce men accuf
â¦rr.cd to the most perfect equality to submit to the rigorous du
s ? cainp, and thus convert the tumultuary array of an tin
cifc:,>..nc.d yeomanry into a permanent force, capable of making
lt,e veter.ifi army of our enemies. With similar fen
imem? do they call to piind the efforts of that heroic fortitude,
which not in the wo.ft of umrt, but rose foperior to
â¢very imsfartunr, infuGngnew spirit into the boforns of an unfor
tunate army, and animating them by the force of example to un
cergo the fevered toil with alacrity, and to endure with pcrfe-er
ance the molt accumulated distress.
It was the will of an all-wife Providence, that the great ob
jeÂ«a we were contending for should not be attained without some
difficulty, and that wt frould be taught to observe and to value
ft)c virtues which spring up in adversity ; but the time of our fe
veic trial was at length terminatedâthecloud which had hovered
over us so long was at length dispelled, and the f, n of American
J; lory appeared tn its full splendour : to have borne this change
'ortune with equanimity, to have employed the lail hours of
command in reconciling our gallant fold.ers to a disappointment
which their long fuffermgs during the war had but ill prepared
them for ; and having checked the rage of civil discord in it, in
fancy, to have relignod all power, and cheerfully descended into
the walks of privatelife, arc circumstances that mud forever ill
umine the page of history, and which, as they cart never be ef
faced tiom our remembrance, so we trust they will be dte D ly en
graven upon the minds of our posterity
To tr.nfmit to that posterity the fpin't of a free canilitution in
""' ve P u r,"y ,s,h <" ho P c wl "d' animates us all; we hope also,
that they will learn from us to cherifo every P rateful fentimem
towards you, Sir, and that they will be proud, as we are, to par
ticipate individually in the honor which America may so iuftly
claim to herfelf, of haying produced a citizen, whose love of

prelTtd an ufeful lesson of patrionfm on mankind, by nobly , e ~

country, whole inhabitants were so enlightened and diiintejeftcd
ai to facnfice local prejudices and temporary fyfteins tor the fake
of rendering secure and permanent that Independency, which had
bec-n the price of so much trcafure and blo*d. Animated with a
hope of tranlmitting to poller ity the fpintofa free cqnftitutiou in

by their piadice, woithy of their successes.
tor inyfclf, notwitlift,a ndmg my former intentions and decla
rations, I could not hesitate to return to public life, when, from
all the circumltances within my knowledge, I had colle&ed it to
be my duty, because it was apparently wifti of a .whole ..ation
Nor shall I regret the Iqfs of that tranquility in retirement, which
iny time of life and of health seemed in some measure, toau
tho rife and require ; if I may fl 11 be an mftrument of any good to
that country, which has continued ro aflifl my adminiflration witji
men generous and unlimited confidence.
I pray you to be persuaded, that while I deceive with great sen
sibility, such repeated proofs of the partiality of myjfellow citizens
in my favor, I feel encrcafing obligations to devote my labors un
remittingly to the public service ; and with the of the
great Father of the UnSverfe on our councils, to use my belt endea
vours that the American people, who have of right aUUmed an in
dependent station amongst the nations of the earth, should forever
remain a great, refpc6table and happy nation.
