HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
TUESDAY, MAY 25.
Mr. Gerrv's motion on the affumptien of the S'jte debts, which was
inserted in this p. per of the 26th, under. 'moderation
Mr. A M ES :
(continued from our last.)
THF-RF, is another view of the fubjeft to l,c taken. It is al
lowed that the people pay duties in prop- >tion as they con
sume dutied articles. The consumption in the several States is
nearly accoidihg to t'he numbers ot the people. It wilt be as fair
in this, as in the former calculation, to takes.i number of rcpre
fentatives as our rule to compute the prop >rtit nvwhicb the leverÂ«J
States contribute by the consumption of artu:i< . charged with du
ties. The impofl of and Mi. Vachufetts colle&ed :
wiihin the period from August to December, id added together,
was nearly 120,000 dollar* Allow the form.: three parts in ele
ven, according to her reprefentatiou, and it vi'.l apptar that her
citizens paid thirty-two thoufond seven hundred dollars of the
whole sum. I.efi than 8,000 dollars were o.lleckd within the
State. In cafe the debts Ihould not be afiumed, but fhouid be
provided for by State duties and txcifea, according to fhefc prin
ciples, the citizens of New-Hampfh<re would have to pay 5.000
dollars a month, or at the rateof 25,009 from \ ugufl to D.ci mber
into the trealury of Massachusetts. â¢ â¢ in like manner,
would nay witb ; n an equal period 54. C d -s, and Jcrfcy, it
Yrckoaerr witn iNew-lork, woutr. nave to p&y Â«hÂ»out tÂ»o,oooiioi
lars, and with Pennsylvania still more. In a whole year, this
tribute which one State would cxa& from another'would amount
to very large sums. North-Carolina is a non importing State,
and in common with the others beforementioncd, would have to
pay for the debt of its neighbours and then to provide for its own.
Is there any justice or cause of difcora and violence charged, or
even imagined, againfl the alTumption equal to this ? And yet we
hear it said, let us leave th# States to pay their debts for them
selves.
Perhaps we (hall never be fully agreed as to what is policy ; on
great quefttons when the judgment should he cool, the paffi ns
most frequently interpose and disturb its decisions, and this is most
likely to happen where public men are zealously faithful to their
trust.
But it is otherwise with our sense of justice ; our pity, our gra
titude, our refemments may mislead us ; but of all the operations
of the moral feofe the most precise and infallible is our sense ol
justice. The heart aÂ£ts as interpreter and guides us to certaiotv â
injury or wrong is the opposite of justice. I appeal to that moni
sens , to that law written upon the heart, and confidently ask,
whether you can impofc this burden upon the States and call it
equality ? Whether you the claims of their creditors
and call it jujlice ?âAs to the policy of the aflumption. To object
is always easy It is not hard to (hew how many little obje&ion
a great measure will be liable to ; but, in a qucftion of policy, we
are oommonly obliged to disregard little things for the fake of
great onesânor can complete proof be given ol the affirmative;
for, when it is asserted that bad cotifequenccs will ensue, time on
ly can fully prove that they will not. I neither expect nor pre-
nd tÂ« overcome every doubt when I undertake to Ihew that it is
more fafc and prudent to aflume than not to aiTumethe State debts.
When we speak of policy what is meant by the term ? A measure
ii said to be against wife policy when it tends to prevent good, or
to produce evilâit rcfpe&s either the government orthecitizens :
as it refpetts government will the afTumption dimimfh its power
or embarrass the cxeicife ol it ? Or as it regards the people, will it i
produce evil and not good ?
This measure can neilher encrcafe nor diminifti the power ol
government; for the power to be exercised is expressly given it
by the coniV.tution. Will it embarrass the exercise of power ?
The contrary is 'rueâit removes impediments which will be in
its way if not afTumed. Experience has taught us, to our cost,
how very pernicious thofc obftaclcs are. The systems of State re
venues before the constitution was formed, had crushed industry,
and almost ruined trad , from State to State.
Will its tendency be to evil rather than, to common benefit ?
This, it is true, is a vague as well as complex question; but its great
o jitts are to establish justiceâto produce equality of burthens
and benefitsâan uniform revenue systemâto secure public credit
>y leraoving every example of bad faith, and to prevent all in
teiference between the national and State governments, and the
dangerous usurpation of the one upon the other, which would bi
the confequcnce.
How can it he f id that policy is against the measure if its ten
dency be furh ? Much has been said about consolidation. Cer
tainly it c nnotbe ulurpation for Congrtffs to pay the debts which
werccontra&ed either by itfelf, or, at its owffrequeft, by the States
Tie State governments are laid to be in danger of a consolidation :
that however, is not the only, probably not the greatest. dangei
rhey havetorifk; disunion is ltill more formidable ; nothing can
lhelter th â¢ small States from thegreat ones but union ; nor woulc
any single State be fafe against the combination of several States.
All would be exposed to foreign foes.âlf you make the State go
vernments strong by taking strength from the union, they becomc
exposed exactly in the decree that you do it. For the principle
509
of union ought to be strong in proportion to the drench of th?
members. In a compound ratio, therefore, you make the n:>fiuu*
al govefnment too weak to combine tic whole to.; thei, and you
governments and citizens to tbti caoncc o( acci<'eiÂ»ts an<i
to the fury of pailions. which \\* ill confound law . libeny-md Â£ Â»-
vernment.
It is true, a body of' valuable citizens will be attached to th
government; all good citizcns should love the government, ami
they will do it it government Ihould deserve their love.
RevenUe powers are given to Congress without reserve. TÂ»
fay ihat it is dangerous and improper to exercile them is a char ;e
againll the conttitution.
There but three points of view toconfider the Slate govern
ments 111. rival? lor powerâ switchmenâor as legtfl 4
tors within the State. To call them rivals, would be an avowal
of the principle of disunion, or rather of positive force, which is '
abfuid.
I do not know that either the State or national ronftitutions
have given them the office to watch thi< government.âThe peo
c!e are to watch us all, and I wilh they always may. But if the
State govei nments are dill called watchmen, that office ma* be
performed as well, perhaps better, without than with the incum
brance of theirxlebts.
It is equally difficult to fee how it can impair the rights of in
ternal Jegiflation. The alTuinption and an uniform plan of reve
nue will take away not only all pretext but every motive for en
croachment upon them. !f, by the non-alTurnption, an interfer
ence is produced, their danger will be the more imminenr. For
if they prevail in the const ft, they will be ruined by difurnon. If
they fail,they will befwallowed up in the consolidation. I wish,
among other reasons, to have the assumption take place, because I
think it will give us the bell security that our government will be
administered as it was made, without fuffering or making en
croachments.
I haltcn to notice some objettians : A public debt is called an
evil and the aflnmption is charged with tending to increafe'and
perpetuate it. lam not disposed to dispute about words, tho I
believe the debt as a bond of union will compensate the burden of
providing for it. But I cannot admit that it is a greater evii to
owe a debt than to wipe it off without paying itâand if the whole
debt is to be paid, in all events, the alTumption makes no increase,
nay, if the modification firft proposed should be made, thecap'tal
will be diminished near thirteen millions by this measure. It is
said to be cafier to pay 80 millions bv leaving the State debts to be
paid by the States and paying the other debt oui ielves, than to
form the whole into one debt.
By this division of the debt, if there is any force in the
tion, v/ccan pay more, or we shall pay what may becollefted more
t&jily. First, let us fee whether this is true as to what the States
will have to provide for. As it rcfpe&s South-Carolina, the con
trary is confcffedly true. So far is it fiom being a more easy way
of paying, that they cannot pay at all. If Massachusetts can pay
her intercft, it will be with extreme difficulty. One gentlemsn
observed that her efforts had raised a rebellion. It is certain thac
t'.< y Â»vÂ» :-m r ur 1 "V | -t-he
States has been some proof of their incapacity to make eiL-ftuai
provision.
The State debts are to be paid, or thev arc notâlf by leaving
them upon the States, they will be loft to the creditors that can
not be supposed to be the more conv> nient mode of paying part of
80 millions which is intended by the argument. Befidesthe (hock
to public credit, it would be a loss of so much property. The
disaster would probably be more felt than some of the greatest
physical evils, such as inundation or blading the* earth for a time
with barrenntfs. If then the debts are to be paid, by what means ?
The gentleman from Virginia, has strongly reprobated excises.
The States cannot touch the impost, what remains ? Dirett taxes
only. This source will be soon exhausted. The land tax of
England is not more than a sixth part of its income. They have
carried it as far as they think prudent. Why should not labor
and flock contribute as well as land ? For these give their chief
value to its produ&s It cannot be expected that the detit will be
fafe to reft upon a land taxâlt is not even mortgaged at all in En
gland. If our entire funds are barely fufficient, nearly a single
fund, and that not the best will be inadequate. It is a better one
in England than in AmericaâFor the wild land makes it lmpof
fible to impose very heavy taxes upon the old settlements, the op
prefTed people will fly beyond the reach of collectors. It is be
sides much more easy to procure the money in England than iii
America. Land taxes arc not only inefficient but liable toother
objectionsâLand is to be taxed according to quantity or value.
If the former, it will not produce much. If according to value,
then you inuft rcfort to arbitrary afTefTments, more obnoxious
than excises. Every farmer almost can attest the force of this ob
jection. The expence too in England is littleâbut in this coun
try it is otherwise. Taxes on land have cost as much to collect as
excif s. In one of the States, lam told that the colleflion has
been eftimatcd at 30 per cent. Experience too has proved that
the States, cannot pay their debts by direst taxes. It has bcca
pushed to the utmost extent and found inefficient.
The argument which has been urged by the gentleman from
Virginia against excises, seems to exclude revenue;
without it the State debts cannot be provided for. The United
States will be compelled to resort to it. It is absolutely necefta
ry for drawing forth the resources of the country. As every man
con fumes, every man will contribute, foreigners and
tianTient people. ImpofU cannot be carried far without defeat
ing the colle&ion. Duties on imported spirits would increase the
use of home made spirits, which cannot be reached without an
xcife. All taxes are in some degree unequal but excises pro
bably as little so as any. The rates are fixed, and very little is
left to imposition and caprice. Besides every consumer taxes him
f If.
If then Congress ftiould not lay excises, the best rcfource of re
venue will be loft. I am persuaded public credit cannot be sup
ported without them. It seems to be a measure of equal nc
eeffity that the States /hould impose them. But the States cannot
do it with convenience, or much effect, for they cannot m<}kc
them general. They will vary in the States, and hold out tempta
tions to an infinity of frauds. The States are restrained from re
gulating foreign tiade, or that from State to Stateâwith such vast
fiontier lines to watch, and their powers on the importation and
.>alfage of goods by land so much restrained, and their laws ob
'h uftcd and controverted by the laws of the union, much of the
colle&ion will be defeated. The excifc in Maflfachufetts and
Conn dficut, it is fuppoled, has not produced 10f. in the pound of
what it might be made to yield. Ido not pretend that there is
:cfs wisdom in the States, but they labour under almost infur
nountable difficultiesâlt is doubtful whether they will be able to
Col!'tt much, and if they should, the burden of these rival lawa
has been found nearly equal to another ta*Â»
nfe? o
[Whole No. 12?.]Betides one State will tax another. The canfurtisrs will go to
the mult convenient market. So that the attempt to make each
State pay its own debt will be defeated, and the payments will
fall as unequally as if the ademption (hculd take place and the ac
counts not be fettled. New-Humpfhire, Connnetticut, Jerky and
North-Carolina would pay almost wholly into the trcafuries ol
the neighbor States. ' The non-importing States will be obliged
also toÂ°impofe direa taxes to pay their creditors, so that their
citizens will be doubly taxed. If State exeifes then yield so little
and are so unequal, where are th le mysterious, State resources,
â which are inacceffable to Congress ? If they are not of an incom
municable nature, we can judge better by hearing the fubjefts of
taxation named. It ought to appear that such ex it, and that Con
gress could not draw, them forth.
Ifyou rejetl exeifes, you cannot have an adequate revenue,
and if the States have alio excites, the revenue will be impoverifti
ed and hazarded. For if ail article can pay both duties there is a
loss to get bat one, it might as well be collided throughout the li
nked States, as in one State, and if it cannot pay both, one or both
trcafuries will fuffcr tor the loss. Betides you incur a double ex
pence of "colle6tion.
What revenues are left you it the excise is rejected ? With such
a (lender sum yuu cannot oiler new terms. The modification o!
the entire debt as full proposed makes a saving in the capital of
almost thirteen millions. The debt to be alfumed is about twen
ty-four. The interest on the difference, or on the real increase of
debt by a (Turning is less than 500,000 dollars yearly.
We depend upon two principles tor the fecuri y of the revenues.
One 'S that th: trading people will not be difpo'ed to offend, and
the other is that all others will be inclined to watch and expose
them if they flvould. Never waifapapular a revenue fylLim. But
the violence to the jull demands of the creditors, depriving them
of the money they have been used to receive, and creating in the
ltates an nterelt to have your collection fail, in order to made the
llatefunds cffe6lu.il, will produce a moll disastrous change. It is
Jetting men's interdls as well as opinions against you. Nor wiil
the landed intcrell have a different sentimentâFor they will be
murmuring under the load of direst taxes, and the more the ftati
revenues can be improved by lessening the national, the less they
will have to bear.
What reason is there, then, for afferiing that more money can be
obtained and more easily, by several fylkems than by one ? rh,s
bold atfertion which the sense of America would refute, il its ex
perience had not done it already, is not true of imposts. I have
â  endeavoured to expose its fallacy with regard to lUie exciftsâThey
produce much evil and little money. Direct taxes, infulficient as
they are, can be imposed by Congress to any amount, which ought
to be required as well as by the ttatcs, and I do not know that they
would be more obnoxious. It is true jull complaint is made ot
their unequal operation, and I trust thatcongrefswill not be under
the neceflity to call ior them. What advantages for taxation do the
Hates possess over Congress ? We ought not to admit that any
fr-.hexift till the reasons and lafls are made knowns to us â which
W:thout adequate funds, the (btcs cannot propofeto their cre
ditors .1 modification of the debt. By the constitution, they are
reftraiued from palling laws to impair I He burden
v. .11 reft upon the dates if not afluincd, at fix per cent, for without
funds the creditors will not content to take less ; il illumed, upon
Congress at four; is this the more cafy way of paying part ot 80
millions ? It makes a ditfercncc of lcveral millions aganift the
public. ......
It we commit an error by not afTuming, it will be an expenlive
one Have we funds so abundant and fate, thatweinay divide and
mangle with impunity ? But we are told that probably there will
be an alTumption at the next feflion, and that it is improper top-Is
a decision at the prcitnt, especially as immediate provilion i> not
to be made, and as delay will reconcile nun's minds to the mea
sure Tiiis is plaufiolr, but at Icall it is yielding the great points
to the principl . If the bulinefs Ihould be relerred to the next lei
fion, with intent then to aflume, ihc Hates will not impul taxes
and frame funding systems (or hall a year. In the mean tnn.-,
this ftateot their paper will make it the fubjeft ot the mott perni
cious (peculation. It will be engrossed for a tnfb by foreigner!,
and at tbc la me timk aggravate the fcartitv of money by employ
in' what there is, in purchases. In this (late ot fufpenle and to s
vTll the public mind become tranquil ? Will it unite the two torn
of creditors? But tho' you delay the interest on the ftatc debts to
i-q-, you pass the revenue laws as soon as pofflble. By delay
vou will lofethe revenue which may accumulate prior to that
t'imeâSuppofe a million and an half obtained before the payment
of interest lhall beg n, thatfum will secure the .interell agamit any
probable deficiency oftheduties for twoor three years. Will not
the public, will not the creditors ot every dcfcription, derive ad
vantage from an immediate alfumption and eftablilhineut ot du
ties, and from the proposed delay of paying interell ?
It is an unusual thing for a gentleman 111 a public alfetsbly to aâ-
fcrt that four fifth of the people arc of his wayot thinking. This
however has been done. It is not ftrarfge for persons to mistake
their own opinion for that of the public. These fond prepotLlH
ons may be received instead of evidence; but they cannot weigh
much against evidence. My information may have Been less dili
e-ntlv fought, and less carefully examine 1 than that gentleman's ;
but I have compared it with what has been gathered by my
friends, and I dcclare that I belie efourfuhsof the wile and wor
thy men, in a very wide extent of country, look with strong dis
approbation upon the injulli-e, and with anxious terror upon the
impolicy of rejcfling the llate debts.
Little notice has been taken of an argument fo,r the alfumption,
which it iuft, is entitled to a great deal ; 1 mean that which has
been ur-ed to shew that it will (lengthen the government. The
answer given is, that, instead of pecuniary influence, new powers
ere wanting to the constitution. This is not denying the arg 1-
nient, but aliening a propofuion, which, iftalfe, isto be disregard
ed and if true, is not inconfiftcot with the point in question. So
far'from denying, it seems to admit the utillity of the alfumption,
and affrrtsthe ut'illi yof some other thing. Which other thing
he his not explained, and if he had, it is probably unattainable,
nor will its attainment, be it what it may, be prevented by the af
fump'um âBut before we ask for new poweis on paper, let us
rxercifc those which are actually veiled in Congress. What will
new powers avail us, if we fuffer the constitution to become a dead
letter ? What has dropped from the gentleman in regard,lo this
point, amounts to an important eonccffioii. Little topics Â«>f ob
jection fink to nothing, when it is allowed that the alTumption will
strengthen the government. Is the principle of union too Itrong ?
Do not all good m ndefircto make it pertect ? What nation has
more to hope from union, or to fear from disunion ? Shall we
makethe union less strong than the people have intended to make
it by adopting the constitution ? And do not all agree, that the
aliumption is not a neutral measure ? If its adoption will give
flrength tothe union, its rejetlion will have the co.itrary effect.
I have thoughfof this government with the fondeft cnthufiafm.
I have conlidered it as tending to mend the condition of mankind,
and to pet petuate the bleflings o# liberty.âAt this late period of
the debate, it is hardlv polfible for gentlemen to exercile impartia
lity. It willbe an aÂ£l of virtue, of magnanimous fclf command
to do moreâto place thcmfelves for a mom< nt in the situation ol
the advocates of the aflumption, and to (et with their eyes. They
love their country, and mean to serve it; and lam sure they would
(brink from the fpeflreof its misery which haunts us; they would
not consent to undo the constitution in practice, to realize the evils
â¢which were only apprehended under theconfederaiion, and which
were preven ed' by the total wânt of power in Congress. With
this principle, however, it will be found that power enough is gi
ven to create division; and to make it fatal : It will beggar the
govermcntj and bind it in chains.
WEDNESDAY, JUNE 30.
A MESSAGE was received from the Prendent
of the United States, with the copy'of an
Ast of theLegiflature of the State of Rhode Island,
for ratifying certain articles of amendment to
the Constitution of the United States.
Mr. Williamfon presented a Memorial from
Dr. Thomas Rufton, in behalf of the directors of
s Cotton Manufactory in the State of Pennsylva
nia.
In Committee of the whole on the bill concern
ing the tradeand navigation of the United States.
Mr. Madison entered into a discussion or the
principles on which the trade and navigation of
.he United Stales ought to be regulatedâthe
idea of discrimination in refpedt to foreigners,as
proposed in the bill originally, having been di(-
lgreed to,however juft and reasonable he thought
that diitintftion to be, he said, as there appeared
to be a majority againftit, he ihould wave any
further arguments on the fubjecJt, and would
fuggeit the principle of reciprocity as an idea
which would meet the general approbation of
the Committee.. Ke adduced several particulars
to lliew that tfreciprocity does not exist in our
:rade andintercourfe with Great Britain ; while
our (hipping is excluded from many of her ports,
and admitted into others under such restrictions
as are nearly tantamount to a prohibitionâtheir
(hipping is freely admitted into all the ports,
harbors and bays of the United States.
He then read two propositions in the following
words, which he proposed Ihould be added as
clauses to the bill, viz.â
Aid be it further enafled, That in all cases
where veflels belonging to the citizens of the
United States may be prohibited from bringing
any articles from any foreign port or place, by
laws or regulations of the sovereign thereof, into
any port or place within the United States, the
vellels belonging wholly or in part to the fabjecfts
of such sovereign, shall after the dny

These proportions being considered as very
interesting and important in their consequences,
it was moved that the committee Ihould rife, that
the members might take time to consider them.
The motion tor the committee's rising was op
posed. m *
Mr. Wadfworth asked ifllat reason could be as
signed for the committee's rising ?âfor his part
lie was ready to meet the propofi lionsâhe be
lieved he (hould vote for themâHe considered
them aÂ« calculated to try the strength of the com
initteeâit is coming to the pointâit is proposing
a very bold nieafure indeed ; but if it is thought
we can Hand the shock.l Ihould have no objection
to try it. I hope the committee will proceed to
discuss the propositions.
Mr. Vining observed that he had no objection
to taking up rhe fubjedtâbut as gentlemen ap
pear desirous of taking time to consider the pro
positions he was in favor of the committee's ri
singâWith refpedt to the " boldness" of the
measure, he wis at a loss to find the propriety of
the epithetâfor his part, he considered it as a
measure offirmhefi âand as such highly becom
ing the national legislature of this country to
adopt.
Mr. Sherman observed, that he saw nothing
that favor'd of boldness in the propositionsâthey
appeared him to be natural, and nothing more
than a proper aflertion of the equal rights of
thiscountryâ It is merely meeting with counter
regulations, the regulations of other countries,
that are hostile to our huereftsâthis we have a
right undoubtedly to do. I hope the committee
will not rife, but discuss thefubjetf, that the me
rits of the propositions may be fully known.
Mr. Goodhue spoke generally in favor of the
propositions, and agaiuft the committee's rising.
Mr. Jacklon was in favor of the committee's
risingâthe propositions he considered as very ex
traordinary indeedâand if they should be adopt
ed, they will annihilate, in a great measure, the
510
trade of Georgia, to the Welt-ladles, andiict,?-
lievecl of North Carolina too, notwithllandin
what the gentleman from that State has said j'it
the course of debate on this fubjedl.-~II e though*
it extraordinary that the gentleman from Vj r .
ginia should come forward with one exccpti ona .
ble proportion after anotherâthe gentleman hav.
ing 101 l one favorite propodtion, so tenacious is
he of his object, that he now brings forward ano
tlier, in my opinion,faid lie,fuHas exceptionable.
The question being taken was carried in the
affirmativeâthe committee rose, and reported the
proportions, which are to be taken into coniidcr
ation to-morrow.

" Nature is mire powerful than fancy, and the mofl
artful fiflions mufi give tody to truth."
IT may look like a contradiction in terms, to
fay that a man muftltrivc hard to act with sim
plicity. Art is perhaps never used to better effect
than in concealing art, except when it is used to
counteract it. The forceof simplicity is so great,
that whoever adheres to if, will be deemed wor
thy of imitation ; but still he cannot ealiiy be
imitated, Those who take delight in viewing
fnbjects by the fair rays of truth, and to make
their actions correspond with the dictates of nil
mingled propriety, mud; engage in a perpetual
conflict with prejudice, fancy, and falfhood.â
There are coxcombs in all profeffions ; men who
pre:end to something more than they deserve ;
jnen who only can derive consequence by giving
a specious coloring to the garb of affectation.â
There are quacks in all arts, who are supposed to
poflefs knowledge in thii.gs which they do not
understand. Such coxcombs and quacks will en
deavor to establish falfe rules of propriety, which
mud be detected and opposed by all, who prefer
real knowledge to boaftcd pretentions; and who
delight in the pyre images of nature, more than
the capricious fictions of art.
The term simple is often used as fynonimous to
wrak or (illy; and this abates the force of it, when
used in its more proper sense, which is to express
the real, unmixed character of a thing. Those
who attempt to strip a fubjedt of all falfe ap
pearances,have a great talk to perform, bur if they
acronipli/b ir their fnbors are well lewnrded.â
There are few men so attached ro error, but tlu-y
â will soon prefer truth, when it is fairly pointed
out ; there are still many men who prefer their
own errors to those of other people. But let them
ouce behold the simplicity of truth, and its charms
can hardly be resisted. The grÂ«ater part of inan
ksnd are conflantly engaged, from habit or pro
ieflion, in giving a fictitious value and a fictitious
character to moit of the appearances which aie
exhibited to the view of the world. How few of
the plausible representations, to which our atten
tion is called, will bear to be ftridlly compared
with a (late of facts ! How many of the elabor
ate fyfteins which are perplexing the votaries of
science, must vanifli intofnoke, if the principles
on which they are built, were faithfully tried
by the standard of truth and reason. For when
ever they are brought in competition, nature will
be found more powerful than fiction ; nor will
the fuggellions of caprice and prejudice be listen
ed to, when ti uth, single and unalloyed, makes
its appeal to the heart.

NEW-YORK, JULY 3, 1790
MR. FENNO,
From the English letter in your last paper, it
appears evidently, that the people of Great-Bri
tain, from the Merchant to theMinifter, forefee
lng the advantagds that will accrue to America
from a proper attention to, and support of her
{hipping interelt, are determined if polfible, to
defeat our expectations, and to throw every ob
ftaclein the way, to prevent our success.
The deep laid scheme of reducing the freight's
for a time, till they have annihilated the Ameri
can {hipping, is to make the southern States pay
dearly in tlte result for their credulity, and inat
tention to the gen-eral welfare of the States of
which they are members. The diftiniftion be
tween apprentices and mariners, is palpably de
signed to counteract a most ejlential mode of
raising American fearnen ; and to prevent our
continuing to enjoy that triflng /hare of the trade
to Britain, which we now pofl'efs. To these ob ;
fervations may be added the followingâThat if
the carrying trade was lccured to American citi
zens, the profits thereon, even at the present low
freights, are fufficient to allure monied men to
place tkeir cash in (hippingâand as a proof that
Great-Britain cannot afford to carry our produce
on the fame terms that America can, if the trade
was secured to herfelf, the following example is
adduced as demonstrative.
The Brig âââis allowed to be as strong a
veflel as ever entered the Thames, and fails fait
âIhe inealures upwards of 300 tons, carries 600
hogsheads, and cost Â£3,253 si 3 di l i, Virginia cur
rencyâhaving the advantage of a freight to Eu
rope as soon as fitted, the earned on her firft voyage
Â£.965 14 11 Sterl.âHer second voyage will pro
bably produce Â£.970 Sterl. â
That will be Â£ 1935 14 11 within the yearâ
and if as well employed will be a clear ihip in i
years. A Britilh Ihip of the fame burthen, and
as good, would coll at Brillol, Whitehaven, or
London, from 13 pounds, to 13 guineas, pr. ton,
or Â£. 5660 4 Virginia currency 14 people, of
which y maybe 'prentices, are fufHcient forfnch
a ve(lÂ«lâwhich can fail 011 as low tefins as any
Britifhlhip; reckoning theintereft and insurance
on each, it will be found to take double the time
to clear a Britilh Ihip, that it will to clear an A
mericanâand when the latter are built faithful
ly out of young seasoned timber will last
near, or full as long.
Accounts fruin Cadiz, via Baltimore, inform
that the Spaniards have 40 fail of the line, be
lides a large number of frigates equipt for sea
and that a declaration of war was hourly expedled.
The anniversary of Independence will be ce
lebrated in this city, on Monday nextâby the
Cincinnati, the society of St. Tammany, and the

the following letter from the Duke of Orleans,
written in London the 13th inft. which was or
dered to be printed and inserted in the verbal
process.
MR. PRESIDENT,
""'ST absent from the National Aflem
bly, Alice tlie perinifliou granted me the 4th of
October Jaltto fulfil the million which his
Majeity did me the honor to entrust to me, I
have since that time been obliged to direct the
efforts of the zeal which animates me in favor of
the of the nation, and the monarch's glo
ry, to other objetfis ; but I am not the less unit
ed in my mind and heart, to theangult AHembly,
of which 1 have the honor to be a member : And
may 1 be permitted to fay that I havepurfued its
affairs with greater interest, as I have always had
the happiness to find my own conformable to the
general wishes exprelled by its decrees. I equal
ly participate in the sentiments of love and re-
Ipeit, with which his Majesty's truly royal and
parental step inspired the Afiembly, when, with
out any other retinue than his virtues, without
any other motive than love for his people, he
came to unite himfelf to the representatives of
the nation, in order to confirm, and to press, if
it were poilible, the happy regeneration, which
forever lecures the glory and happiness of France.
It was natural, that on that memorable day, each
of the mcinoers of the Assembly, ftould be anx
ious to make a public profeffion of the principles,
which it has so constantly praiftifed ; and tocon
o, I l } felt for not having it in my power to par
take 111 this grand even:, I carefully recollect
that I may be of some utility to my country.
In tliefe circumstances, I request you, Mr. Preii
tlent, to intreat the Afiembly in my behalf, to
be pleated to receive my formal adherence to the
oath which its members have taken the 4th inft
and to permit me, like them, Â« swear fidelity
Â« ain 1C " a f t,on ', the l aw > King, and to main
( tain, as far as lays ,11 my power, the eonftitu
-11011 decreed by the National Aflembly, and
" accepted by the King."
(Signed) L. Pâ. I. d'Orleaks.
By this I execute as far as i n my power the
decree pafled the 4 th inft. by ,he Nation.,! As
fembly ; and I shall think myfelf happy to have
been always united with it in sentiments as I
have been >n principles. '
I am, with refpetft,
