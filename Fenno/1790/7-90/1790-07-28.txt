THE rivalry, between thehoufesof Guise and
Montmorency, or in other words, the am
bition of the Cardinal de Lorrain, and the Duke
of Guise, to outstrip the Montmorency's, produ
ced a war. Charles the Vth. was preparing with
a numerousariny to lay siege to Metz. It was not
doubted that the conduct ot so important a war,
â would be committed to one of the two favorites.
But the Constable Montmorency, more than fixry
years ot age, preferred arelidence near the per
son of the King, to a rifqne of his reputation, in
new dangers. The Duke of Guife l , on the con
trary, full of courage, and burning with ardor to
<tiftinguifli himfelf, solicited the command, with
the more vivacity, as he law no other resource
than in military fuccefles, to efface the credit , and
cclipfe the glory of theConftable. Me was there
fore charged with the defence ot Met:', with
the consent, or at leait, without tile opposition
ofthe Constable, who, internally, was not dis
pleased to fee his competitor, expose his lite, or
his reputation to danger. The Duke fulfilled
perfetftly, the idea, whicii had been conceived
of his valor and prudenceâuncertain as the suc
cess of the enterprise had been, he came out of
it victorious, and covered with glory. This great
atftion did him fomuch honor witll the King, and
the whole nation, that they committed to him,in
preference of all others, the command ot the ar
my, which they sent afterwards to Italy, to re
conquer the kingdom of Naples. Either by the
fault ofthe French, or the inconstancy of their
allies, this expedition failed, or, at !eaft produ
ced little advantage : Yet the ill success was not
imputed to the Duke, who drew from it more
glory than he could have done from a victory.â
for this reason : Philipthefecond Kingol Spain,
upon the abdication of his fcith-r, Charles thaVth.
turned his arms against the frontiers of France,
and entered through Flanders into Picardie, to
make a diversion si oin the war in Italy. Ihe
Conltable as Governor of that Province, was then
obliged to take leave of the King, and, aguinll:
his inclination, run the hazards ol war. rhelofs
of the battle of Sflint-Qnintin, where the Span
iards took him prisoner, l'pread a consternation
through all the neighbouring ptovinces. The
friends ofthe Guiles in council, conhl difoover
no surer means of repelling this invasion ot the
enemy, of repairing the lotl'es, and preventing
the conferences of this defeat, than by recalling
Italy the Duke of Guise. The celerity of
his return, added to the memorable conquetts of
Calais, Guifne, and Thionville.fullyju (lifted these
hopes, and gave him that superiority over the
Conltable, that a Conqueror inuft ever have over
one who is conquered.
TheConftable, however, obtained his liberty,
and returned to court. The King s ailetftion for
him was not abated. Henry, attributing hislate
misfortunes to the lot of arms, and the fortune
of war, conversed familiarly with him, and, still
convinced of his capacity, confided to him the
weight of public affairs. In the critical circuin
ftaiices ofthe Snre, the Duke and the Cardinal,
who had acquired a great reputation, the one by
his exploits, and the other by his abilities, appre
hended that if they could not throw l'ome power
ful obftaclein the way ofthe Conltable, he would
rife higher in favor than ever. They resolved
therefore to gain to their parly, Diana, Dutchefs
<5f Valentinoisâto connect their interelts with
hers âand to make her protection and favor (erve
as a foundation of theirelevation. And who was
*liÂ«na ? Of illuftvious birth, defrended from the
ancient liuufe of the Counts of Poitiers, in the
flower of her age, ihe united with uncommon
beauty, a sprightly wit, an acute and fubne un
derltanding, the molt infinuatinggraces of behav
ior, and all the other qualities which in a young
woman, enchant the eyes and captive the heart.
She had married the Senechal of Normandy, who
soon left her a widow, with two daughters. She
took advantage of her lingle state to deliver her
fejf up to the pleafurei and amusements ofthe
Court. Her charms gained the heart of the King,
whom <he governed with an absolute empire. But
ib.e behaved with so much arrogance, and appro
priated to herfelf the riches of the crown, with
i.'Â« much avidity, that Ihe made herfelf odious and
infjppurrabJe to the whole kingd otn. The Qurcn,
WEDNESDAY, JULT 28, 1790.
full of indignation, to h'ave-a rival so powerful,
behaved towards her 'with, aif exterior decency,
but in her heart bore her an implacable hatred.
The nobility, whom ftie had ill treated in the
persons of feverstl gentlemen, could not with pa
tience, fee themselves trampled under foot by the
pride of a womanâand the people detested her
avariceâto which they imputed <he rigorous im
posts, with which they were loaded.
The Guises, without regard to the general dis
contentâsensible only to thafo-jr of losing their
power, fought the friend/hip <5X the Dutchels,
vvho soon declared herfelf openly in their favor,
and by marryingone of her daughters to the Duke
ot Aumale their brother, fupportedthem with all
her credit. The Constable eaflly unravelled the
irttrlgues of the Guises, and, not depending on
the marks-os confidence which he received from
the King, thought to fortify himfelf, equally, with
the prote&iou of Diana. If the Guises had flat
tered her, by the splendor of their birth, he did
not difpair to gain her to hi* intÂ«reft, by satiating \
heravarice,apaffion as ungovernable in her heart,
as ambition. He begun to make his court to her,
and endeavored to gain her by considerable pre
sents. He had lb much at heart the success of
his measures, that in fpiteof hisratural pride, he
did nothefitate to feekalfoher alliance by espou
sing to Henry Lord of Damville, his second son,
Antoinette de la Mark, grand daughter by the
mother, of the Dutchefs of Valsntinoisâa reso
lution so much the more imprudeht, 3s Diana was
already ftricftly united with the party of the Gui
ses, andlabor'd sincerely, with all herpower, for
their aggrandizementâwhereas she favored but
coldly the designs of the Constable. All the
me_iis which had been employed in opposition to
the elevation of the Guises, became useless. To
the merit of their servicesâto the intrigues by
which they had continually advanced tiiemfelves
âat the time, when they disputed with so much
vivacity, with their rivals, for the firft rank at the
Court, was added, the marriage ot' Francis, the
Dauphin of France, and the elded son of the King,
with the Princess Mary, sole heir of the kingdom
of Scotland, daughter of James Stuart, lately de
ceased, by Mary of Lorrain, lifter of the Duke
and Cardinal. All alliance of so much magnifi
cence, drew them near to the throne. There re
mained now, to the Constable and his family,
only the friendly sentiments, which the King
preserved for them by habit; and to the other
courtiers, only the offices of linaller importance.
The principal dignities, thefaireft governments,
and the general fuperintendance of affairs, civil
and military, all were placed in the hands of ths
Guises and their creatures.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE COLONIES,
Prefenttd to the National AJfemHy, in the name of
the Committee appointed Jor that purpose, the 234
March, 1790.
By Mr. Barnave, Depaty from Danphiny.
ADMITTING the ideas that have been detail
ed, and that the colonies are in a state of
tranquility, well administered, . and delivered
from oppression, one thing ftilj r*mains wanting.
They offer themselves to every body, by their
riches, as an objeA of an adfive ambition, but
want the population, and cannot procure within
themselves the maritime and military forces ne
ceflary for their defence.
It is necessary then, that being united and
identified with a great power, they may find by
the disposition of its strength, the security of the
bleflings acquired by means of a good conftituti
on, and good interior laws. _ ,
It is neceflary that this power, interested 111
their preservation, by the advantages gained in
its tranfa<ff ions with them, should coniider it a
duty to fhovv the molt constant equity towards
them, that it fhou)d always present a fufficient
orce for their protection, and that by its iwduf
-1 ry: its prodiuSions and capital, it may be polled
ed of every means neceflary to fonn the most ad
vantageous commercial connexions.
Here then is the whole of what is neceflary
for the poiirical existence of the colonies, by fe
coring the prcfcrvat o;i of every interior advan
ce ; V ts what tluife (he kl Ha e pointed out

10 them, who inspired them with a vvilh for a
good constitution.
Were there persons thoughtless enough to
dare to invite them to a Separate political cxif-
to an abfolnte independence, we would
a!k theni, laying aside faith, engagements, ajid
every thing which great nations can employ to
cnforce them ; we would ask them, what is then
the secret oftheir hopes ? Where are their forc
es to protect them ? Would they take men from
cultivation to make sailors and soldiers of them ?
would they oppose them with any hopes against
thefirft: powers in the world - ?
But, they will fay, we will procure for onr
felves alliances anei guarantees. And do you
think tliey will be disinterested ? Though they
may be for a while, do you think they would be
so long ! Da you not lee that every protection
would be the commencement of a new arbitrary
government over you ? We, with whom you are
connected by so many duties and so many ties,
can we not fay to you, forgetting every thing el fe
except your interelts, behold our principles, re
gard our laws ; choose whether you will be the
tree citizens of a free nation, or whether you
will soon become the IHves of those who should
now offer themselves as yourallies.
And altho they iheuld flatter themselves, that
a dominion eftablilhed on such foundations, may
preserve for some time an appearance of jultice,
we would ltili alk them, where is the nation that
can promise our colonies, more loyalty, wore
fraternal regard, than we now teftify towards
them
Where is the nation that can display for their
protection, greater or more solid ftrengtli than
what we aredifpofed to do, after the crilis of our
regeneration !
Where is the nation to whom nature has given
greater means to carry on commerce with them ?
Which can produce and prepare within itfelf,
more materials fit for their confutnption ? Which
can make a greater ofe of thrirs-#- Whidr jjoitttt
es in fine, beyond us, every thing that can lead to
that point, wherein a mutual exchange is attend
ed with the greatest possible advantages.
They have not, it is true, hitherto drawn in
their fulleft extent, the advantages which these
different considerations give reason to expert ;
but to what other cause was this owing, than the
abuses which we have destroyed ?
The administration of their government was
oppressive ? The answer is in our revolution,
the answer is in the decrees and the inftru<ftions
which we fend to the colonies.
Our naval force has never attained the degree
of preponderance which the extent otour means
and our geographical position assigned it. But
what more than us, had those to boast of, who
with fewer men and lefsriches, have maintained
themselves in the firft rankamongmaritimepow
ers ? They had a constitutionâthey were free.
In short, the iituation of our commerce did not
present all the superiority of advantages which
the whole of our resources warrant, as soon as
they shall be developed.
But are they ignorant, that hitherto the geni
us of the French nation has alone struggled against
all these initiations, all thele (hackles, all these
prejudices !
Are they ignorant that an unaccountable opi
nion, ranked almost every other profeHion above
commerce, agriculture and produtflive industry,
and thus destroyed in a nation, fond of refped:
and glory, the gem which gives birth to every
kind of perfe&ion ?
Are they ignorant, that people hitherto with
us, betook thenifelves to commerce, in hopes of
soon enriching thenifelves, and that they quit it
asfoonastliey had acquired fufficient fortune tÂ»
prosecute it on such an extensive scale, as would
be like advantageous to thenifelves and those
with whom they tranfa<fted bulinefs.
Are they ignorant that the capitals, which
ought to have promoted ufeful industry, were
ablorbed by a borrowing government, and the
crowd of itockjobbers with which it was sur
rounded !
Are they ignorant that the profits which this
government was obliged to offer in return for the
want of confidence, and thofc of the infamous
traffic which was supported by its profulions,
kept up in France the iatereft ofmoney toaprice
that was alone fufficient to restrain below medi-
ocrity, all the branches of ourinduftry, and to
change every proportion of our competition with
othver people ?
[Whole NO. IJJ.]Such are the ahufes which we have never ceaf
ed to attack, and which we are daily engaged
in destroying. Every day approaches us to the
period, when freed from the fetters which have
hitherto restrained our powers, we (hall at length
take among nations, the station that was alligned
ns. Then our liberty, our power, our fortune,
will become the patrimony of all thofc who have
shared our deftiwy ; then, our profperiry will
extend to all those who lhall contrast with us.
i he National Allembly is unacquainted with the
language and the ihifts of political artifice ; it is
ignorant of, and moreover despises the means, ol
captivating the pÂ»ople by any other ways than
byjultice. Reciprocal attachment, mutual ad
vantages and unalterable fidelity ; these, people
of the colonies, thele are what it promises and
what it demands from yon. The Krench nation
experienced a long time (ince what it may expe<ft
from you : we demand no other sentiments from
you ; we rely on them with certainty, and we
wi(h that they were daily more merited and
more juftified on our part : we recommend to you
at this moment a profound tranquility, a Uriel
union between yourselves, the n;noft celerity in
the labors which are to prepare your new exis

than others, and you arc no longer obliged to
agitate yourselves to obtain by coaqueft, what
the National Aflembly has resolved to propose to
you, from the firll moment you became the ob

" Knowledge is valuable in proportion as it affords
light in managing our pfaClical duties or employ
ments."
IT is to be regreted that men of ingenuity do
not turn more of" their attention to works of
utility. Many Â»f the performances that are of
fered to public view, thougli they may discover
some traces of genius in the writer, yield little
or no advantage to the reader. SubjeÂ«fis may
either be too abftrart to be underltood, or they
may be too uninterelting to be regarded. To
render a publication ufeful to any large number
of people, it fliould have a reference to points
which are to be carried into practice. It is of
vast importance that men should hnve a just way
of thinking relative to every objetfi, that in any
degree influences their conduct. I have made
tliefe o"bfervations merely to introduce a letter,
I am favored with, from a friend at Boston.âÂ»â¢
My correspondent is one of those persons who is
liberal in encouraging all attempts to promote
literature ; and it is his greatcll wish to recom
mend such performances as are calculated to
make men better and happier, and to remove
popular errors or prejudices, which owe their ex
igence, more to the inattention than to the inca
pacity of mankind. His remarks on a late pub
lication areas follows.
" I have read with great pleasure and atten
tion, a volume of eflays lately offered to the
public by our mutual friend Mr. SV. IVebfter.
Though I have not leisure to enter into a re
view of that work, I am too much pleased with
the performance, to pass it over without a tew
comments. Mr. IVebJler has felefted such fubjetfts
for ciifculfion, as are not only capable of being
made obvious intelligible ; but such as are
important enough to deserve attention, and may
afford ufeful hints and to every class
of readers. I admire his remarks upon practical
politics : They areoften new, andfeldom failof
bei.Bg pertinent. He frequently ilhiftrates his
fuSjeifl by a judicious application of facts ; and
more generally deduces his principles by way of
inference, than sets out with a favorite system,
that requires a departure from reason and com
mon sense to support. In short he {eems more
solicitous to investigate truth, than to establish
specious hypotheses. There is a force and sim
plicity in his stile, that renders it peculiarly a
dapted to political difcufiion. Though he always
thinks boldly, and speaks freely, his observations
are never 1 >ofe and unconnected, and his lan
guage is remarkably chaste, expreflive and unas
Â«ec(ed. His composition in point of vijror and
classical propiiety cannot well be exceeded."
Thus my correfpondfent ipeaksof Mr. Wdfler'%
publication. Icould wifli some person would fur
nifh a complete review of the work, as I am per
suaded it will be approved in proportion as it is
brought to the test of criticism.

SIR,
THE favorable reprefeutations I liave had of
your disposition to fupprei's violence and
restore peace and confidence between the people
ofGeorgia, and the Creek Indians, have induced
me to open a correspondence with you, not with
a deiign to enter into the merit or demerit of
pad tranfatftionsi farther than the restoration of
property belonging to the people of this Stateâ
something of this nature I trull will be agreed
to, and complied with, as far as the nature of the
cafe will by any means admitâand also that every .
lpecies of future depredation be withheld. If a
condutffc of this nature, and more particularly a
ftritft observance of peace and good order in fu
ture, be fully ratified and duly observed, it will
give the government of this State an operation to
put in pra<flice the wish and desire of the greav
body of the people thereof, I mean a return of
mutual confidence.
Froui our situation as neighbors we ought to
be rendering mutual services to each other; your
traders and meflengers, would have free egress
and ingress, and security would be th* lot of all.
Humanity will readily dictate the propriety
of liberating and fending forward the citizens
and other persons belonging to this State now in
the Creek nation.
I trust that your good undeiftanding will rea
dily suggest the necellity of my being enabled to
give afl'urances to the frontier settlers of a full
security of person and property âthis too being
guaranteed ill the name of the nation, will de
termine me in making such arrangements, as well
as reprefentatiensto the President of the Unired

I am, Sir, your 1110 ft humble servant,

I RECEIVED your letter of tlie Bth January

account of the extraordinary floods, I fend this

In answer to your's I have to observe, that,
as a peace was not concluded on between us at
the Rock Landing meeting, your demand for
property taken by our warriors from off the de
puted lands, cannot be admitted. Wc also have
had our loflesby captures made by your people.
We are willing to conclude a peace with you,
but you must not expedl extraordinary concefli

of human blood, and to "finally determine the
war, I am willing to concede in some meafnre,if
you are disposed to treat on tke ground of mutu

It will save trouble and expence if the nego

BOSTON, JULY 21.
Lad week at Pownalborough, in the County of
Lincoln, before the Supreme judicial Court,
came on the trial of Samuel Hadiock, of Mount-
Desert, for the murder of Eliab Littlefield
Gott, a young man of about 22 years of age ;
and after atrial, which laftedthe whole day, the
Jury returned their Verdi<ft, that the prisoner
was Guilty.âln the course of the trial, it appear
ed that Hadiock previous to his committing the
horrid murder, had worked himfelf up into a vi
olent pallion with his neighbours, on account, as
he said, of their propagating some ftorics to hi*
disadvantage ; the firtt effetfi of which discovered
itfelf at the house of one Manchejler, where, after
some abusive language he seized Mrs. Manchejler
by the hair of her head, pulled her out ofdoors,
and threw her on the ground several times, in a
great rageâhe then left the house, andinafliort
time after called to the deceased, who at thi.
time was parting by, in a boat, and requested to
be set across the river in lire boat. With this
friendly design Gott went on shore, Hadiock in
quired where he was going with his boat I Gott
answered, to an island after sand. Hadiock tolci
him he had no right there, as he himfelf had a
lease of the island. Gott replied that he did not
know it. Upon this, Hadiock fattened the boat
and plunged Gott three times under the water,
holding him down some timeâhe then with a
large club drove the young man and a boy that
was with him up to ManchepÂ»r , % house, where he
found one Richardjon, who had been called to the
aid of this riiftrefled familyâhe immediately sei
zed Richard/on by the collar, thrust him out 01
doors with g'"eat violence, who taking advantage

came out, Hadlock caught hold of his hair and
held his head hard down Â«n his own breast, he
vial relieved be Mrs. Manchefler âRichard/on now
permitted Hadlock to rife, on his solemn promises
that he would behave decently, and not offer
further abuse to the company ; no sooner was he
at liberty, than he snatched up an hedge-stake
and pursued the young men, but not being able
to come up with Richard/on, he pursued Gott,
whose clothes were wet, and boot's filled with
water, soon came up with him, and knocked him
down ; the young man then begged him to
spare his life, and that God would have mercy
on hiin ! Hadlock told him to pray quick, for it
Jhould bt the last time ; repeating his blows which
fractured his Ikull in several places. The wit
nefles tettified that they left them in this lituati
on, not daring to return until the next morning,
when jtlrey found Mr. Gott both senseless and
speechless in Manchefler's house, which had been
deserted over night by the family. Mr. Gott
Survived but a few hours. Thus fell an innocent
young man, a vi<stim to the ungoverned pallions
â¢of[an unprovoked neighbour, probably too much
inflamed with fti ong drink. Let such as indulge
this vice take warning by Hadlock's unhappy si
tuation, especially when they are reminded that
the law considers intoxication as an aggravation,
rather than an excuse for a crime.

boat off Sheldon's shoals, up Connecticut river,
about 16 miles, upfett, on board of which were
two men, who were very fortunately drowned as

married a wife in New-London, and moved to
New-York ; there were found on board amongst
the ballad, it or 12 large keys fitted for liore
locks of different kinds.

About 2 o'clocklaft Sunday morning, the dwclling-houfe of
Air. William Mansfield, of Lynnficld, was severely (hocked by
Jightning ; which llruck the top of the chimney, and took off the
south part to the roof, and (hook the whole tÂ® such a degree as to
unite Ax smokes into oneâtore up the h arthâthan entered a
hrge deeper which led to another in the middle of the roorti, and
tore the floor all up as it went ; from thence took, us course to
anothef part of the house, and went out under a bed at the corner,
in which were two persons, who received no injury, aitho the
bed was much damaged, thr cord broken into a number of pieces,
and the bed-clothes considerably burnt ; as it went out of tVu
house, it tore away the boards, and in that part much damaged
the frame ; thencc proceeded to a chaife-houlc, fevcral rods from
ihc dwelling-house, and fct forae tow on fire, wlrich must have
ronfuined that, with all the adjacent buildings, had not the fire
kern immediately extinguished by one of the family, who in the
alarm had run out of doors TJÂ»e liglniv-g;, in irr thro
the house, entirely demoliflied two large windows, broke the
falh.es, and melted the glass, besides (lightly damaging two or
three other windows atihe opposite part of the house ; it over
turned the furniture, unhinged the doors, and almost entirely do
ftroyed al' the brittle ware in the house.âThere were 15 prrfons
lodged in different parts of the house; but, protected by a divine
Providence, not one ot them received the lead injury.
Never did the face of the earth exhibit a mote 'promising ap
peaiaocc than at the prefrnt season. Such burdens of grass have
Jcldom been known, as are now cut. English grain is uncom
monly filled our, and, if no unforcfeen accident happens, will
yield a rich harvefl. Indian corn is very flourifliing ; and the.
fruit-trees of all kinds are richly laden.âHow happy the Situa

44 he acknowledges no landlord but the Lord of all laud;" and
it may truly be said, that " God hath given him of the dew of

NEW-YORK, JULY 28.
Yesterday the military corps of this city in uni
form, were reviewed on Col. Rutgers'gro und, by
The President of the United States, the Hon.
Gen. Knox, the Kings t Headmen, and Warriors
of the Creek nation,HisExcellenry the Command'
erin Cliiefofthe militia, and other military per
sonages of diÃin<ftionÂ» The troops acquitted
themselves in a manner highly honorary to their
commanders, and to their own military charatfter.
The President was pleased to express his approba
tion of heir soldierly appearance and deportment,
and the applaufeofthe lpe<ftators was unreserved*
ly bellowed.
If the peace and tranquility of the United
States depended on the allumption of the Sate
debts. If the operations of the general govern
ment were liable to insuperable difficulties in cafe
of non-aflumption,and if distributive ahdimparti*
aljuftice was absolutely suspended on the affirm
ative of this question. The facrifices of public
time and treasure, occasioned by endeavours to
furmountand obviate the objections to this mea
sure, are but as a drop to the ocean, compared to
the solid, substantial, injuring and encreafuig ad
vantages derived to the whole people from the
allumption. From this moment, the face of
public affairs aflumes a new, a vigorous, and ani
mated afpe<ftâunlimited confidence isreftoredin.
the Councils of the Unionâand having one greac
objetf, the perfecting our whole financesâcom
merce, arts and agriculture will receive a spring
hitherto unknown.
A correl'pondent observes, that the Affumptiort
of the State debts rivets the chain of Unionâand
blackens with despair the enemies of our Nation
al Constitution.
By this, the monfler with thirteen heads re
ceives his death woundâand all the (lings of fac
tion are drawnâThe State governments, while
protected by one Head in the participation of jus
tice, will sensibly realize the blessings which flow
from union-, the machinations of State demagogues
to divert the people from a steady pursuit of their
best interests will prove in vain.
Had the Members of this State voted againffc
the Assumption, and thus have defeated the mea
sure, it is pretty evident general inter*
efts would have been most essentially injured.â
Conjjeflicut and New-Je+fcy, the arms of our com
merce, while faddledwith taxes to pay their State
debts, mull have given up their commercial cha.
rafter, or forever remained ruinously in debt to
our merchants.âAnd what would have become
of the little State of Georgia, was her once pow
erful, wealthy neighbor to be cruflied beneath,
the weightof her enormout,,but meritorious debt?
Died, on the 25 inft. at his Scat near Elizabeth-
Town, his Excellency William Livingston Esq.
Governor ojtheState of New-Jersey.âA fiation which
he held with diftinguijhed honor to himfelf, andadvan
tage to the State from the firft year of the revolution.
In his death America sustains the loss of one of htr
mo ft distinguished patriots ; and the republic of let
ters a very brilliant ornament. Born and educated
in this country, his whole life was a con/I ant fucceffiort
of ferv'tces to promote its. lejl intereQs, and in every
public department he discharged his duty with great
bility, and the mofl confciencioux integrity. His ami~
able family, the State, and the public at large, have
to regret the removal of so much worth and Virtue
out of life.
