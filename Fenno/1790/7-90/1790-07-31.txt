WHILE all minds, were held in agitation at
Court by these events, the Bourbons fuw
themselves, notwithilanding their proximity of
blood, and pretentions to the cro\jÂ», contrary to
the ufjgeof the nation, excluded from employ
ments and honors. Except when the necellity
of a war, or the exercise of some office of little
consequence, which remained'to them, required
their presence, they appeared not at Court. It
is true, that the Count D'Aguien, onÂ« of the
Princes ot this houfe,had advanced iiiinfel'fby his
merit and valour. The King had given him the
c'ommaud of his army in Piedmont. The battle
of Cerizolles, which he gained againlt the Spa
niards, had raised his reputation. But this ad
vantage was too tranlitory to raise the house of
Bourbon. This Prince died by accident, m the
flour of his age, and his brother, the Duke D'An
guien was killed at the battle of Sr. Quintin.
There remained therefore none of the children
of Charles of Bourbon, but Anthony Duke of
Vendome, and King of Navarre, by his marriage
with Jane of Albret ; Louis, Prince of Conde,
the Itock of the branches of Conde and Conti,
killed afterwards at Jarnac, and Charles, Cardi
nal Bourbon, proclaimed King afterwards by
the Leaguers, under the name of Charles the
tenth
The chiefs of the house, were now, Anthony
Duke of Vendome, and Louis Prince o>f Condc,
Lis brother, both Tons of Cbarles of Vendome,
â who, after the revolt of the Constable de Bour
bon, and the captivity of Francis the si rft, by his
moderation and difinterettedncfs, had somewhat
calmed the hatred which had Jwen viol tntly cu
iindted rhofeofhis blood*. TbÂ«efe Princ
es, deprefled by the Guifcs, whom t! icy called
Itrangers and new comer 9 from Lorr tiin, com
plained bitterly, that except the right of fuccef
Â«on to the crown, which 110 man couL 1 rake from
them, they were deprived of all their privileges,
auid especially ot the hopor of rcfidin g near the
person of the King. That they scarcely held
any rank in a court, where their t irth called
them to the fir lk places afier his jetty : arid
that such conuutfl was equally inconl iilent with
reason and equity. l"he King howc sver, main
tained with-inflexibility, thepoweroi 'the Guises
againlk all remonftrancea and compl. lints. The
Bourbons endured with less impatier ice, the ele
vation of the Constable Montmoren :y : on the
contrary, they were severely mortifi td to fee his
credit diminilh. United with him bj 'an alliance,
hv views and by interests, they flat lered them
selves they might obtain by his me Bn9 a decent
Tank, if they could not re-ascend r o that which
their ancestors had pollefled. But now,'depriv
ed of that hope which supports the unfortunate
l>y foftening the fentinient of thi sir ills, they
bore with (kill greater impatience tl leirdifgraces.
Anthony of'Vendome, a Prince ( if a mild and
moderate chara&er, appeared to fopport thairi
â with more tranquility than the ot Jiers, because
he meditated great designs. He had married
Jane of Albret, only daughter of Henry, King of
Navarre, ar.d afier the deat;h ofhir! father in law
he had taken the crown and title of King. His
-projecfl was to recover hirj kingdom of Navarre,
of which the Spaniards had nia<le themselves
masters, for several .yea ;s, durin:* the war, be
tween Louis the Xlldi, ' and Ferdinand the Ca
tholic. The Kings of France, to whole interest
-chisftate had been facr'ificed, had attempted feve
â¢ xal times to reconquer it. The Spaniards, who
could ealil.y inarch tro< ips t6 its relief, had hither
to defended it. Butt- he two crown*, being then
npon the point of co; icluding a solid peace, the
King ot Navarre, hop ed to comprehend in the
treaty, arid to obtain ; i relkitution ot his heredita
ry lkutea, or, at leal t, an equivalent. lie â was
confirmed in this the ught, by the birth of a son,
. to whom he gave the name of Henry, in memory
,of bis maternal gi'Â»n< llather. This is the Prince,

la "g and bloody wai *s, to the tfironeof trance,

inspired them with more ardor, to recover their
dominion. Anthony chose rather tointereft the
King of France, to demand this restitution in the
treaty of peace, than to finicit in quality of firft
Prince of the blood, governments and dignities
in the kingdom. It was this, which engaged
him todiflemble with more patience and mode
ration than the reft, the injullice done to his
house. The King, periiftiug in the design of
lowering continually the Princes of the blood,
or perhaps irritated at tbs reful'al of Anthony,
to exchange Beam and his other ftates,for cities
and territories lituated in the interior of the king
dom, had difinembered train Guinne, of which
the King of Navarre was governor, as firft
Prince of the blood, Lauguedoc and the city of
Toulouse, to give the government of it, to the
Constable. But the King of Navarre, ftiewing
little resentment of this injustice, pursued cou
ftantly his firft views. (To bs continued.)

municate them to the colonialAflembly,fhould one
exiit already formed ; to notify thein in like man
ner to theprovincial Afleinblies, and to give legal
and authentic knowledge of them to the inhabi
tants of the colony, by proclaiming and fixing'
them up in all the pariihes.
2d. if a colonial Aflembly exists, it may if it
pleases declare that it judges the formation of a
new colonial Aflembly more advantageous to the
colony than the continuation of its own powers,
and in this cafe, they fliall immediately proceed
to new eledlions.
gJ. If on the contrary, it conceives its conti
nuation moil advantageous to the coloniesit may
commence its operations according t<o the mode
pointed out by the National Aflembly ; but with
out being capable of using the power granted to
the colonial Aflemblies to execute certain decrees,
until the intention of the colony with respeCt to
its continuation has been proved, agreeable to
the forms hereafter fee forth.
4th. Immediately after the proclamation and
fixing up the decreed institutions in each parifti,
every person who lhall have attained the full age
of 25 years, proprietors of real eltate, or for
want of such property, Ikall have been fettled
in the parilh for two years, and paid taxes ;
(hall ali'emble together to form the parochial As
sembly.
Sth. The parochial Aflembly being formed,
lhall commence by taking into full coniideratioi,
the decree of the National Aflembly of the Bth
inft. and the present inftruiftions, to procecd in
the execution, in the manner following.
6th. If no colonial Aflembly antecedently
eleifted, should exilt in the colony, or if that
which exiited has declared that it judges it molt
expedient to form a new one, the parochial As
sembly (hall immediately proceed to the election
of deputies to the colonial Aflembly.
7th. For this purpoie, there lhall be made
out a llatement and an enumeration of all the
persons ofthe parish, absent or present, poflefltd
of the qualities exprefled in the 4th article ot the
present inllrurtion, to determine in proportion
to their number, of the deputies which
ought to be fenttothe colonial AlTembly.
Bth. This enumeration being made, the num
ber ofthe deputies to be nominated, (hall be
determined, at the rate of one for one hundred
citizens ; observing, lit, that the lait hundred
lhall be judged compleat, if it amounts to the
number of fifty citizens, so that for ijo citizens
there fholl be two deputies ; tor a;o citizens,

(hall be had in the parishes where there Ihall be
more than 100 citizens, and the fractional num

only one deputy be appointed, and so on. 3d, In
the parilhes where there Ihall be less than one
hundred citizens, a deputy shall nevertheless be
appointed, however small the number of citizens
Ihall be whichmay be found therein.
9th. After having determined the number of
deputies which they have to nominate, the pro

in the manner which Ihall appear most luitable
to them.
10th. The parochial Aflemblies lhall be at
liberty to give inllrmftions to their deputies, but

TREASURY DEPARTMENT,
July aoth, 1790.
In Obedience to the Order oj the House of Reprefcatatives,
OJthe twentieth oj January li/t,
TiV Secretary of the Treasury,
RtfpeVfully Reports,
THAT in the f jrmation of a plan for thr difpofuion of the vacant
lands of the United States, there appear to be two lead in *
object* of conftderation ; one, the facility of advantageous sales
according to the probable course of purchases ; the other, the ac
commodation or individuals now inhabiting the wellern coun
try, or who may hereafter emigrate thither.
The former, as an operation oi Finance, cUims primary atten
tion ; the latter is important, as it relates to the i'atisfacfion of the
inhabitants of the western country. It is 4sfirable, and does not
appear impracticable, to conciliate both.
Purchasers may be contemplated in three claflesâMoni.d in
dividuals and companies, who will buy to fell againâAlloca
tions of pertons who intend to make fettleinenis themselvesâSin
gle persons or families now resident in the weft:fn country, or
who may emigrate thither hereafter- The two Hi ft will be fre
quently blended, and will always want considerable tra6b. Trr
laft will generally puichafe small quantities. Hence a plan for
the sale of the wellern lands, while it may have due regard to the
last, (hould be calculated to obtain all the advantages which miy
be derived from the two firft classes. For this reason it fcems re
quisite that the General Loan-Office Chould be eftabhlhcd at the feat
of government. ' Tis there that the principal purchafrrs, whether f
citizens or foreigners, can most ealily find proper agents, and chat
contracts lor targe puichafes can be best adjusted.
But the accommodation ot the present inhabitants of the weft
em territory, and of unaffociated persons and families who may
emigrate thither, seems to require, that one office subordinate t<>
that at the feat of Congress fbould beopened in ttie north-wcilcrn,
and another in the iewth-weftern government.
Each of these officcs, as well the general one as the subordinate
ones, it is conceived, may be placed with convenience under the
fuperintendance of threC commiflioners, who may either be pre
eltabliflud officers of the government, to whom the duty may be
assigned by law, or persons specially appointed for the purpose.
The former is recommended by considerations Â©f ceconomy, and
it is probable would embrace advantage which Could be
derived from a fpccial appointment;
To obviate those inconvcniencies, and to facilitate and enfure\
the attainment of those advantages, which may arise from new and
casual circumftjnces, springing up from loreign and domcftic cau*
fes, appear to be an object for which adequate provision should
be made in any plan that may be adopted. For this reason, and
from the intiinfic dilÃculty of regulating the details of a fpecific
provision for the various objeÂ£U which require to be consulted, so
as neither to do too much nor too little for either, it is refpeftlul
ly submitted, whether it would not be advifeable to vest a con
hderable latitude of discretion in the commiflioncrs of the general
fubutt to some such regulations and limitations as sol-
low, VIZ,
That no land shall be fold, cxcept such in refpeÂ£l to which the

location, than may be abfolutcly necedary.
That any quantities may ntverthelefs be fold by special contra#,
comprehended either within natural boundaries or lines, or both.
That the price (hall be thirty cents per acre to be p*id, either

of the general land-ojfue,who may also commit to them the manage

dient to place under their diretlion.
That there shall be a surveyor-general, who shall have power to
appoint a deputy surveyor general in each of the weflern govern

is a gazette, for the information ot the citizens of the United
States.
Regulations like these will define and fix the mod edential par
ticulars which can regard the disposal of the western land*, and
where they leave any thing to discretion, will indicate the general
principles or policy intended by the legislature to be observed,
for a conformity to which the commiflioners will, of course, be
icfponfible. They will at the fame time leave room for accom
modating to circwmftances which cannot beforehand be accurate
ly appreciated, and for varying the course of proceeding as expe
rience shall suggest to be proper, and will avoid the danger of those
obftrufiions and embarrailmeuis in the execution, which would
be to be apprehended from an endeavour at greater precision and
more cxzCi detail.

Secretary oj the Tieajury
CONGRESS.
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
FRIDAY, JULY 23^
Debats on the Amendment of the Senate to the Fund-
itig Billy to affttme a part of the State Debts.
MR. JACKSON moved that the amendment of the Senate
reipcdting the AfTumption of the State debts, should be dif-
agrted to.
In fuppoitofhis motion he said, it is with great relu&ance I
rile again on the question before tiic house. A measure which
has not only agitated this legiilature, but has more or lefcconvulfeii
the whole people ot the United States. It has elated speculators
and state irckets, wh'ilft it has tieprtficd three fourths of the ho
nest part of the community. It has held out alluring profpe&s
and fortunes to the one, whiift it has blasted and withered the just
cxpe&ations of the other. It has, in short, been the centre pin ot
visionary projectors and intereftcd men, whilst its future effe&s
have been viewed with horror by difmterefted minds.
To give a history of th:s important qucftion, for important,
however wicked, it certainly is, would be to tax Congress with
the mofi extreme inconsistencies; repeatedly hasthe question been
decided, and repeatedly negatived, and as the principle was firft
originated without reference, the fameftubborn disposition is man
lfeft, notwithstanding the repeated determinations of the house.
The forms of Proteus have been affumcd, and the forms of Pro
true have been iet'ca.ced here, but a new fhapc is not still wanting
tc aid riie pcrfeverance of the East. The Senate of the United
States, a power not know 11 to, nor chosen by, the people, have
to load the citizens ot the United States with an enor
mous debt.
I will rot appeal to the paflions; but I rail on the house, as
the representatives of the people, as the guardians of their liber
ties, to refill this encroachment on their conftiluents rights, they
"vw U1 expeit it, a..d if the principle is eftublifhcd: at present, there
is no knowing to what lengths it may be carried in future. As
well might the Senate under color of an amendment, have iulcrted
the whme funding system, in an appropriation bill, as have infer
cd this new principle in the law before the house. It may be ad
vanced, that it is no money bill, tkat there are no ways and means,
no taxes or burthens imposed on the people. To intcreiled men,
and perlons wpo would not look beyond the furface, this reafon
nig might appear just; but I would ask if the taxes and burth ns,
the ways and means mud not followâpafs this principle in the
law, and the public faith is bound ; neglett to provide for it, and
you lay the government open to mfult.
But, Sir, fettiug,this encroachment of the Senate from our view
for the prcfent moment, I have no objection to conlider the ques
tion on its own merits. Nothing which I have yet heard has con
vinced me of its propriety. The accumulation of an immense
debt ought to be founded in more than perfcverance for i's basis ;
it ought to have jullicc for its ground work, and policy for its lu*
perftrufture.
The question of justice h3* been subservient to both fides of the
house ; but the great rules, the leading features of justice have not
been answered, if they have been attempted. Where, I again de
mand is the justice of compelling a (late which has taxed her citi
zens for the finking her debt, to pay another proportion not of her
own, but the debts of other States, which have made no exertions
whatever ?
If this AfTumption had taken place at the eonclufion of the war,
the principle would have been more jnft than at prcfent, because
none of the States had made exertions to relieve themselves from
debt, and they were nearer on an equality, but even then it would
not hjve been on peifefl terms of luftice, the situations of the state,
and the xr charges, were not the fame.
But fir, supposing the accounts fettled at the elofe of the war ;
how would ihe expences of the war have been proportioned, not
agreeably to the present ratio of representation, will be allowed
me, how then ? Why, by of existing requisitions or near
ly so, and Georgia, would have paid the one ninetieth part of the
whole debt, whereas at pufent, the is bound for the one twenty
second. But now, fir, even the ratio of representation is to be
overleaped by the present of the AfTumption, and by a
calculation of the quota, (he will pay upwards of 600,000 dollars
more than (he will be benefited by. New-Hampshire and Geor
gia ought to receive, if a just quota was allowed as the 65th part
of the 21,000,000, 992,307 dollarseachâthey are, by the system
before the house to receive but 306,000 dollarseach, which makes
a deficiency of 692.307 dollars and lome cents of their proportion
of the amount which is to benefit other States, and the c i izens ot
New-HampfhÂ«re and Georgia are to pay it. Can this house ex
pect that they will quietly submit to it. If the citizens of New-
Hampfhirc are disposed to be easy under the imposition, I do not
believe the citizens of the state 9f Georgia will be contented.â
Let us examine some of the other States. Maflachufetts is to re
ceive of the sum 4,000,000 ; her just quota of the sum would be
*,646.153 dollars or thereabouts, enjoying an excess in her favor
of 1,353,846 dollars. South Carolina has still a greater excefs,flic
is to receive 4,000,000 ; her quota of the sum would be 1,653,846
dollars and some cents ; thecxcefs in her favor will be 2,3461,53
dollars. North Carolina has an excess of 746.153 dollars, where
(he has not asked it, and when the State and her representatives
are averse to the mcafure. What, fir, I will ask, is this for ? Is
it by way of gift, or douceur ? I know her representatives to be
too honest, too ftcady to their trust, to be bribed. Georgia and
New-Hampftiire are however not the only states whiah will fuf
fer, New-Yolk and Maryland will likewile be injured. The
former is to reccive 1,200.000 ; herjuft qnota would be 1,904,615
dollars, there will be a deficiency therefore of 784,615 dollars.
The deficiency of Maryland is much greater, ftie is to receive but
800,000, and the deficiency from the amount of her just quota
will be 1,184.615 dollars. One state (Pennsylvania) has a million
allowed her above the amount of her debt. So that some of the
ftatts are to be double, and some treble taxed, for the benefit of
others. I will here. Sir, appeal to the fame moral sense with the
gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Ames) to the fame rettitnde
of the heart, and Lwill confidently demand from him, if ytÂ»u can
impose this burthen on the States, and call it equality, if you can,
adopt the AflTumption and call it justice.
I consider the state which made exertions, as I mentioned on a
former day, to have paid off so much of its proportion of these
debts, whether called the debts of the States, or the debss of the
Union. II state debts, the state ought to pay the debts of other
ftatcs ; if they are the debts of tl.e Union, then has the state which
has exerted ltfelf and paid off its own debt, contributed to its pro
poitiou,and ought not to pay a second time.
A gentleman Irom Conncftirut has analized the argument in
favor of the measure. As I think them of as much weight as any
that have been advanced, I will notice a Jew of them, as well as
my small ability will permit. That gentleman's fitft argument
is, that the debts were contracted on behalf and for the benefit of
the United States, and that therefore justice requires they ftiould
beaffumcd. On this principle, the gentleman has endeavored to
prove that the debts are of the fame nature, and in faÂ£t the debts of
the Un'ted States. The very term, however, which he uses, of
date debts, must convince htm they are so ; his explanation with
a gentleman from M jflachufctts (Mr. Gerry.) why they were not
mfrrted in the conflitution, has cqnvinced me that they were not
as the debts of the Union bythe Convention. That Con
vention met, and the Constitution was formed, for the redoration
of public credit, and if the (late debts were a part of the debt of
the Union, provision would have been made for ihem. But, fir,
if the convention had 110 power to insert them in the conflitution,
whence all our powers are derived : Neither, Sir, have we a pow
er under that Constitution to provide for the payment of them :
Neither arethofe debts of the fame nature-with that of the United
States. The fame fcrutinizingeye hath not pervaded the refpec
nve dates. Some dates in expe&ation of being the paymaderj
themselves, have dealt with a rigid parsimony, others ha\e been
as extravagantly liberal. Some have allowed regiments of olfi
ceisto their militia without men, whtlll others have'reducejl their
officers to a grinding situation. Some have allowed large boun
ties and pay, as has been the cafe with some of the States who
complain mod, whilst others have scarcely allowed bounty or
pay at all. Many of the chargcs of individual states would be
rejettcd, whilst others which the dates have rejeficd would be al

none but intereftcd individuals can prevent difeerntng it.

Sundry petitions and memoriae were read and referred to the
heads of departments.
The report on the petition of Catherine Greene, widow of the
late general Greene, was read the second time; this report was

LONDON, May 21
WE learn from Mefliua, that on the 3 tft March
at 8 in the morning, the mountain Paci,
â which covers Scylla, on the east fide, fell into
the sea with a horrid crafli. The commotion it
excited caused the waters to overflow the country
for 2 leagues and rife to the top of Sicily. Six
persons perished at Scylla, but the filhermen at
the lighthouse had time to save themselves. It is
supposed that the sea had been undermining it
ever since the earthquake of 1783, by getting in
to the excavations then made.
The Brunfwiek man of war lately launched,
has several couveniencies new to the navy, par
ticularly one, by which the levers of the chain
â¢pumps may be {hipped and unlhipped with
ease, so as to render all clear ; as alto more liin
ple means of obtaining intelligence of the exaift
draught of water during an ac'tion, without be
-ing exposed to the enemy's fire..
The most authentic accounts from Spain do
not juftify the belief that they have more than
thirteen fliips of the line ready for sea.
Mr. Bruce, the late traveller allerts : With re
gard to cotton, the fineft valliesin Syria, watered
by the cool refrefhing springs that fall from
Mount Libanus, are planted with this flirub; and
in the fame grounds, alternately, with the tree
which produces its filler in manufactures, lilk.
Cotton clothes all Ethiopia ; cotton is the basis
of its commerce with India ; and of the com
merce between England, France, and the Levant,
and cotton flionld be the favourite manufacture,
after wool, of Britain. It will in time, fays Mr.
Bruce, take place ofthat ungrateful culture flax;
will always employ more hands, and be a more
ample field for diltiriguiftiing the ingenuity of
our manufacturers.
On the Bth instant a very cruel murder was
committed in the vicinity of Cork. Richard
Newnham, Esq. and his brother Devbnfhire
Newnham, Esq. went 011 a hunting party near
his feat at Maryborough : One of the neighbour
ing peasantry intreated them nottopafs through
his potatoe ground, as it would ruin him and iiis
family. Devonshire called the poor wretch a
scoundrel for his prefumptioti, anU inftanily
llruck him with his whip, while his brother
Richard inhumanly ft ruck him on the back part
of the head, until they fractured the skull of the
unfortunate man, of which wounds he inftanily
expired. The Coroner's inquest has brought in

NOO'TKA SOUND.
The circum'.tarices of the trade and ficuation
of this part of North America being a matter of
ftich general conversation anil great public mo
ment, we are particularly happy in beingenabled
to give fomc further accouut of the tranfaiftions,
that have happened at Noorka Sound, as well as
to point out the advantages that were likely to
Ve extended to other places by the means of this
irade.
It is neceflary to remark that tlie Ikiu of the
i'ea otter is worn only in the Northern regions of
China. Its fur, though beautiful and magnificent ,
is too heavy for the sultry atmosphere of th<
Southern Provinces.
Pekin is, therefore, the proper mart for this
valuable commodity ; and in this inunenfe city,
rhc consumption is so great, that the produce ot
the voynee meets an immediate sale.
The* Mandarins of the court, and even the Em
peror himfelf, are fond of wearing this costly
fur. To a citizen of common rank, a lea otter s
collar to his vellment is a luxury.
The natives of the north-weft coatt of America,
set so great a value on woolens of all kinds, that
all the blankets, cloths, hats, and stockings, that
could be procured in Chins, if Englilh manufac
ture, were fold to the Indians, with whose chiefs
treaties of commerce had been formed.
An aOt of cruelty committed by an ollicci ot
the Spanifli Admiral Martiney's fliip deserves to
be recorded.
The Spaniards discovering that Callicutn, a
chief, second in authority at Nootka Sound, was
in alliance with the English, he was shot through
the heart in the month of June, 1739. The wife
of Callicum, with an infant child, escaped, but
not till wounded.
Macquilla, the chief, firft in command, retired
at the head of the allies of England, from Noot
ka Sound, and to avoid the cruelty of the Spani
ards, they fled to dill ant parts. Such of the na-
tives as they could seize, the Spaniards condemn
ed to work as leaves on their fortifications.
At this period, it was in contemplation of the
Spaniards to seize the Sandwich ((lands, with a
view to deprive Britifli lhips of refrelhments.
And we further add, on authority that amounts
nearly to demonftratiou, that on the very lands
put-chafed from the Nootka chief by captain
Mears, the Spaniards have already opened valua
ble mines. \
Another objecfl of thisenterprife was, to supply
the markets of Kamfchatka, and other ports be-
longing to the Ruflians, with the teas and other
produce of China. This promised to bean inva-
luable channel of commerce, as the Chinese have
shut their ports against the Ruffians, who former-
ly traded to their markets.
On this voyage of discovery and experiment,
one of our ships failed and disposed of her cargo,
but was unfortunately lod on her return to
China
To these curious particulars we add, with a
patriot joy, that the consumption of the glorious
staple of England, her broad cloths, is aitoni(h-
ingly great in Japan and China: British hard
ware, &c. is also in great request .
From the Friendihip of Tiara to Captain Mears,
ships which touch at the Sandwich I (lands may
depend 011 the utmolt attention and civility.
This Prince is fix feet four inches and an half
high, and of proportionate bulk.
Amoft degrading circumstance, respecting the
insult upon the Britilh flag at St. George's Sound,
has not been yet communicated to the public :â
A Captain Kendricks, commanding an American
(hip, had been trading a considerable time on
thecoaft, and the Spaniards rreated him with the
greatest civility, so that Spain has the temerity to
dare the maritine power of Britain, and yet
truckles to the American Ilripes.

Yederday his Majedy was pleased to ifl'ue his |
Royal Proclamation for recalling and prohibi

In a letter received by yederday's poll from

Common, and Gofport ; and the owners had let
them upon terms of enormous advance, provided
the war should continue. They have even con
t'ra<ffed for building of new houses, as they ap
pear certain of a war, and that it will prove ve
ry advantageous from the amazing riches our
ships of war and privateers most probably may
bring from the South Seas, and other Spanifli fet
tlenients.
By accounts received at Lloyd's upwards of three
hundred fail of merchant ships are expedled to
arrive in the course of this month, which will
furnifh Government with a fufficient number of

Â« Those pcrfons who lead a sedentary life fbould
contrive that their amusements be oj such a nature as
to give considerable exercise to the limbs."
I HAVE frequently observed that men of a
studious, contemplative turn of mind lose
tlicir relilh for such amufementsas require bodily
exertion. This is a circumlVance that deserves
to be seriously considered by those whose mode
of life leads them to sedentary habits. Man is a
being formed more for action than contemplation.
He preserves his her Ith, clieerfulnefs and the na

perfection, while he follows adiive pursuits, than
when he is devoted to study and lotirement.

To comprehend every charge, it is probable that the late war
was anexpence to the people of America of at least 60,000000 of
pounds fieri. The paper money was an effr&ual tax, which has
not cost the government much to collect. What was advanced
during the war was paid rather by fuffcringthe noble cnthufiafin
of the people to tax itfelf, than by the resources of Congress. The
sums paid towards the debts since the peace have been at a great
discount. Perhaps not a (ingle instance Can be given of a dollar
paid at par. The entire remaining debt ks about eighteen millions
iterling, or eighty millions of dollars. It will appear therefore
that the burden of this debt, however heavy upon unfortunate in
dividuals, has been light to the government, as more than two
thirds of the charges of the war no longer exist as debts againfl
the Union. It seems to follow clearly, that altho joftice calls for
a good provision for the existing debt, and it may seem useless to
urge any other motive, yet this claim of judice is enforced by the
above (late of falls. Why should we wifti to dilpute the validity
of it, or object to paying what remains, inasmuch as we have ex
tinguilhed vast sums on such easy terms ?
If it is thought neceflary tofufpend part of the demands of our
creditors, on account of our present inability to pay them : Go
vernment is under every poflible obligation to pledge itfelf to do

Few perlons cultivate the science of Anatomy with ardor in

LONDON, May 10â1Â£.
LORD George Gordon, in confcquence ofan
altercation with the gaoler of Newgate, has
been removed from his apartment into the ground
cell, and there confined without bed or furni
ture ! Without deciding 011 the propriety or im
propriety of the gaoler's conduit, every man of
feeling mult lament that his lordfliip is reduced to
so deplorable a lituation.
The immense train of Austrian artillery which
was at Peterwardin palled Vienna on its way to
Moravia the 20th ult. The firft piece palled ai
half pall fix in the mornijig, and it was half palt
two in the afternoon before the whole had gone
by, though not one moment'sltoppage took place
the whole time.
The alfair as Marseilles, according to the best
accounts was hot fa bloody as at firit it was re
prefeuted. The commander of Fort Sr. John
was the only person who loft liis life, and this on
account of some improper expressions two days
after the fort was surrendered. The populace
then renewed the dreadful fcence of Paris during
the firftdaysof the revolution.
A Deputation was lately sent to the Queen of
France from the committee ofrefearches in Paris
to request information with refpejft to the vio
lences committed at Versailles, on the night of
the 6th ofO&ober. Her firft answer was, " 1
will never become an informer against any of
the fubjeifis of the King !" The deputation wait
ed on her Majesty a second time, when heran
lwer was still more emphatic, " I have fein every
thing," laid sheâ" I unierjlood every thingâand
have forgotten every thing.
On Monday two journeymen flioemakers in
Livei pjol of the name of Griffiths and Wright
ten, agreed for a wager, to try which was the
neatelt and moll expeditious workman, for which
purpose they set to at five o'clock in the morning
and continued with little intennifliou until eight
hi the evening, during which time, the former
made, in a neat and workmanlike manner thir
teen pair and an odd one of children's pumps out
of the rough, with the heel-rans and infoals pro
per ; the latter made twelve pair complete. 'Tis
l'uppofed the grcateft performance ever known
to be done by any ot the craft.
A Mr. D brought his wife before the Ma
gistrates, at the Public Office, Bow-street, for af
faultingand beating him. D gave an account
of the last afiault she had committed on him (for
to enumerate every one would have taken up the
Magistrates time, perhaps, till now.) It was with
a hearth-broom, which the lady thought proper
to break over her hulband's head. He gave an
other proof of tlie happiness he had experienced
in the matrimonial state ; for he declared, out of
fifteen years that he had been married toiler, he
had not three days quiet, owing to her turbu
lent disposition, which had reduced hiin from a
state of independence to poverty. She was com
mitted to Tothill-fields, Bridewell, until Ihe
finds bail for her appearance at the next feflions.
A LINCOLN'S INN FROLIC
TWO young gentlemen who arc studying th'e
law, and who have chambers in Lincoln's Inn,
took a particular fancy the other day to a young
woman who frequented the garden with a child
in her arms. They laid various stratagems to
entice the mother to come into their chambers ;
but she saw the intent, and studiously avoided a
viiitof that kindâAt last they thought they hit
upon a scheme that must effeclually bring her in.
One of the gentlemen took the baby in his arms,
and, after killing it, brought it home to his apart
ment. The other itudent followed, and both
now imagined that the woman lnuft naturally
come for her child ; but, as the faying is, " fae
bit the biter" for (he lent the child to their pro
tection, and made the bed of her way home ;
and has taken care to conceal that home from
them. i hey are persons of good fortune, and
have sent the child to nurse. The public may re
ly on our alfertion, that this is afatf.
ANECDOTE.
A Tar, after returning from a voyage for low
wood, having made rather too free with a plank
belonging to the owners of the vellel to which he
belonged, was taken before a justice, and accu

That the orders which the Spaniards had gi*.

termanded ; and the belt informed inercantils
men infer from thence the certainty of a war with
Spain.
