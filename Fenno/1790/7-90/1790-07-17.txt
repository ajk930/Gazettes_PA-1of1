(Concluded from our hjl.)
*Tis with our judgments as our watchesânone
Go Just alike i but etch believes his own,
THAT there is already a fciffion,in the National
Assembly.like all others,paft, present, and to
tome is most certain. There i*
party, a democratical party, an armed neutrali
ty, and moil probably a monarchical party : be
sides another division, who uiuft finally prevail,
or liberty will be loft ; 1 meanafet of members,
who are equal friends to monarchy, ariltocracy,
and democracy, and wish for an equal indepen
dent mixture of all three in their constitution.
Each of these parties has its chief, and these
chiefs are or will be rivals. Religion will be
both the objevftand the pretext of foine : liberty,
of others : submission and obedience of others :
and levelling, downright levelling, of not a few.
But the attention, consideration and congratula
tions of the public, will be the objedt of all. Si
tuation and office will be aimed at by fomeof all
parties. Contests and diflentions will arise be
tween these runners in the fa.ne race. The na
tural and usual progress, is, from debate in the
afl'embly to discussions in print : from the search
of truth and public utility in both, to sophistry
and the fpirii of party : evils so greatly dreaded
by the ingenious " Citizen of New-Haven," to
whoui we have now the honor of paying our firft
refpeifts, hoping that hereafter we may find an
opportunity to make him our more particular
compliments. From sophistry and party spirit,
the transition is quick and easy to falftiood, iin
polture, and every species of artificial evolution
and criminal intrigue. As unbalanced parties ot
every defciiption, can never tolerate a free en
quiry of any kind, when employed against them
selves, the licence, and even the molt temperate
freedom of the press, soon excites refeiument
and revenge. A writer unpopular with an op
pofue party because he is too formidable in wit
or argument, may firft be burnt in effigy : or a
printer may have his office aflaulted : cuffs and
kicks, boxes and cudgels, are heard of, among
ptsbeian ftatefmeu challenges and single com
bats among the ai iftocratic legislatorsâRiots and
seditious at length break men's bones or ilea oft
their (kins.âLives are loft : and when blood is
once drawn, men, like other animal*, become
outrageous : if one party has not a superiority
over the other, clear enough to decide every
thing at its pleasure, a civil war enl'ues. When
the nation arrives at this period of the progrelli
on, every leader, at the head of his votaries, even I
ifyou admit him tohave the bell intentions in the
world, will find himielf compelled to form thein
into some military arrangement, both for offence
and defence, to build callles and fortify eminen
ces,like the feudal Barons. For ariftocratical ri
â valries and democratical rivalries too, when un
balanced agaiirit each other, by foine third me
diating power, naturally and unfailingly pro
duce a feudal fyftein.âlf this (liould be thecourfe
in France, the poor, deluded, and devoted parti
zans would soon be fond enough of decorating
their leaders, with the old titles of dukes, mar
quifles and counts, or doing any thing else, to
increase the power of their commander over
themselves, to unite their wills and forces for
their own fafety and defence, or to give him
weight with their enemies.
TVie men of letters in France, are wifely re
forming one feudal system : but may they not
unwifeiy, lay the foundation of another ? A le
eiftature in one afl'embly, can have no other tpr
mination than in civil dillention, feudal anarchy,
or ftmple monarchy. The best apology which
can be made for their freffi attempt ot a sove
reignty in one allembly, an idea at least as anci
ent in France as Stephen BoetiuSyii, that it is only
intended to be momentary. " a f*nate had been
propt&d, it mlift have been formed, tnoft
bably of Princes of .he biood, Cardinals, Arch
bifiiops, Dukes and Karquifles, and all tliefe to
gether would have obllrudted the progress of the
reformation in religion fciid government, an d
procured an abortion, to the regeneration of
France. Penr.fylvjiiia eftabliflied. her fingie ai
fembly in 1776, upon the fame principle. An
appreheiifion that the Proprietary and Ouaket
intercfts would prevail, to the election ot charac
ters dififfcCted to the American cause, finally
prenwsdeiated agnhiA two initiative councils.
SATURDAY, JULY 17, 1790.
Pennsylvania, and Georgia who followed her ex
ample, have found by experience, the necelfity
of a change : and France, by me fame infallible
progress ofreafoning, will discover the fame ne.
ceflity : happy indeed, if the experiment shall
not cost her more dear. That hefubjeft iscon
fidered in this light, by the belt friends of liberty
in Europe, appears by the words of Dr. Price,
lately oublifhed in this aper ' Had not the
; ariltocraticrtl and clerical o*deiÂ»," fays UÂ»at
u sage and amiable writer, " have been obliged
" to throw themselves into one chamber with
" the commons, no reformation could have tak
" en place, and the regeneration of the kingdom
" would have been impolfible. And in future
" legislatures, were these two orders to make
; " diltinct and independent states, all that has
" been done would probably be soon undone.
" Hereafter, perhaps, when the new conftituti
" on, as now formed, )ias acquired strength by
" time, the National AfTembly may find it prac
" ticable as well as expedient, to eftablilh by
" means of a third Estate, such a check, as now
" takes place in the American government, and
" is indifpenfible in the 3riti(h government."

INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE COLONIES,
Preftntei to.th: National Jiflimbly, in the name oj
the Comtnittee appointed jor that purpose, the l^d
March, 1790.
By Mr. Baknave, Deputy from Dauphiny.
qfce.
THE National Aflembly having, by its decree
of the Bth inft. invited all the French colo-
nies to transmit their wiflies refpe<fting the Con
stitution, the administration, the laws, and in ge
neral refpefting every rfieafurethat may conduce
to their prosperity, has announced that there
should be annexed to its decree, some inftruiftions
necessary to attain this in the surest and most ex
peditious manner. ,
The{e inftrutftions ought to have for tlieir ob
jeÂ«ft, the formation of allemblies, destined to ex
press the views of thecoloniei, and some general
points which may serve as the basis of their labor.
In order to know the wish of the colonies, it is
indifpeufably neceflary to convoke colonial al
lemblies, as well in those colonies where none as
yet exifts,as in those where the existing afiemblies
are not authorised by the confidence of the citi-
zens.
The National Afl'embly being obliged to trace
prov i{tonally a mode for their formation, conceive
it necefl'ary to choose the simplest forms, refein
bling the nearest mode which have been adopted
in the colonies where the citizens have freely as
fembled of themselvesâin Ihort the molt suitable
to Allemblies, whose principal objedt ought to be
I to prep re plans of a constitution.
These afiemblies will judge for themselves,
when preparing the constitution of the colonies,
what ought to be in future the conipoiition and
mode of convoking colonial allemblies. 1 o prel â¢
cribe at this time multiplied and complicated
regulations on this head, to do any thing more
tl.an what isabfolutely neceflary, would not on-
ly be running a rilk of committing errors, not
only creating difficulties in the execution, but
would be altering the spirit of the decree pafl'ed
in favor of the colonies, by tracing as it were be
fore hand, the constitution they are invited to
propole.
With these confederations, the National Aflem
bly are of opinion, that the deputation to the firft
colonial allemblies, should be dire<ft, and without
any intermediate degree of eleÂ«Â£lors.
That it ought to be made by parifha.
That each parifli ought to depute, in proportion
to the number ot acftive citizens ic contains.
That for this convocation, and until the con
stitution is agreed upon, the qualifications oi
an atftive citizen should be, a man of lawful age,
and a freeholder, or if not a freeholder, a ie(i
dence in the pariihof two years, ajid payment of
taxes.

CONTINU ED
The rcafons common to all these articles, are
the extreme facility of the execution, their re
semblance to what has been pratflifetl in tHose co
lonies, where the inhabitants of themselves have
formed aflemblieaâin fllort, the character of a
pure, diretft and universal representation, which
particularly agrees with assemblies, designed to
prepare plans of a constitution.
It may be added wi'h efpedl to dire-il depu
tation, ttei the popi: ic . . > tl*a rdAonaei is >07
favorable to it, and that this mode of represen
tation is the only one that nature points out', and
which the severity of principles avows, and ought
to be rigoroully observed wherever it is poflible.
As to deputation by parishes, these at this in j
ftant are the only political division in the colo
nies which can conveniently answer the purpose
of representation.
As to the reprefentationbeing proportioned to
the number of adlive citizens, it is the only pof
lible measure that at present offers itfelf, and
which appertains to the principal foundation of
thealfeniblies, which prepare conftitutionsâfor
these aflemblies exeicifing a right which essen
tially belongs to the people, by no means offer
ing a magistracy or an instituted power, but the
image and representation of the people them
selves, all those who enjoy the right of citizen
lhip are naturally called to ic ; every o.ne ought
to take his place there, were it not for the im
possibility resulting from their numbers, or from
some other motives. The nomination of depu
ties is nothing else to these Aflemblies, than a re
duction which circumstances render neceflary,
and can consequently only be proportioned to
the number of thole who, in a natural order
ought to have concurred in the deliberation*
It will hereafter be seen what precautions have
been taken in order to prevent this form of re
presentation being disadvantageous to the coun*
tr^.
With refpeft to the conditions provisionally
annexed" to rhc qarrfificaiions Â»fact ch'zcn,
it may be added to what has been said before,
that it is for the general interest of each colony
to multiply the number as much as poifible, and
that the fame number exilfs in each particular
parilh, since the number of their deputies will
be proportioned to that of their aiftive citizens.
It appeared, however, that for want of freehold
ellate, the limple condition of taxation would
not be fulTicient, and that in colonies where ma
ny people refidebut for a short time, and with
out any design of fixing themselves there, the re
sidence of two years appeared indispensably ne
celfary to confer the qualification of an a<flive ci
tizen on a taxable, not a freeholder.
This disposition is one of those which will
contribute to protect the country againll the pre
dominant influence of the cities.
The proportion of the number of deputies to
that of adhve citizens, cannot be the fame in all
the colonies. The difference of their populati
on is too considerable, and alt ho the bell peopled
colonies ought to have the mod numerous colo
nial allemblies, it is impoflible to eftablifli this
proportion to the number of their citizens.
The number ofdeputiestoeach colonial aflem
bly ought to be fufficiently large to authorize the
confidence of the colony, and that of the mother
country ; it ought to be fufficiently confined so as
not to become too heavy a charge to the people,
and that the celerity of operations, which every
circumstance renders desirable, may not be re
tarded.
The National Aflembly are of opinion that the
colonial aflembly of St. Domingo, to which is at
tached the uninhabited Islands of la Toriue, la
Gonave and la Nache, ought to consist of about
one hundred and fifty deputies.
It has conceived that this result may be obtain
ed by appointing one deputy for every hundred
active citizens, with the following modifications.
The deputation being made in eachparifh dif
tintftly and separately, justice requires that the
least parish fliould not be unrepi efented, and
consequently ought to appoint one deputy, even
though the number of its citizens fbould be be
low one hundred.
With respect to such parishes as (hall contain
more than one hundred citizens, it has appeared
juflthat the number which (hall be found above
the complete hundreds, ihould be entitled to a
deputy, even though they Ihould be fifty and.
less, feeing it is equally near the number where
the deputy is fully due, and that where there is
no pretentions, the lÂ«nefit of representation and
("Whole No. 132.]that which in the colonics is particularly due to
the country, ought to determine in favor of the
me a Aire
It is evident thatthefe two latter difpenfijtions,
as well as tiiofe which, relnte to the qnalification
of an active citizen, are ail on the iide of the.
country, arul tend to re-eitablifh in cheir favor
the jult proportion of influence they ought to
enjoy with th? town. .
LONDON, April 10
A PERSON at Bath was lately found hanging
in his bed-chamber. The coroner's inqueu
* from foinecircum(lance9of the deceased's llate of
tnind, the day preceeding this melancholy event,
were rather doubtful how they could, with pro
pnety, bring in'a verdidt of lunacy, when they
were determined by the remark of one of the jury,
a taylor, who archly ohferved, " That the decea
fedmull have been insane, for he had paid him
the day before a bill that had been owing only
three months.
An easy and effectual way roprevent Slugs get
jnginto Fruit Tree*, &c.âlf the trees are itand
aids, tie a coarse liorfehair rope about them,
about a foot from the ground.
If they are ngainft a wall, nail a narrow flip of
coarse horse-hair cloth against the wall, about a
foot from the groundâthey will never get over
itâandifthey attempted.it would kill them, as
their bellies are foft, and the points of the hair
would wound them.
The rife of rent of is. pr. acre, would inrreafe

Exportation of products and manufactures is
what brings in wealth to a nation, and is the
great advantage of an active trade. All countries
in refpe<ft of riches may be mod accurately jud
ged of by this criterionâtheir wealth must be in
proportion to their exportation. The example of
Spain and Portugal may teach us tliat importation,
even of gold and silver, and diamonds, will not
enrich a country, since those valuable articles
presently bccoine the property of indult'rious na
tions, who export products and manufactures
This branch of trade is what receives the great eft
encouragenientamong commercial nationsâpar
licnlarly by a proper regulation of duties, laying
heavy ones on the importation of moll commodi
ties, and light ones on the exportation of them,
or, in some cases, none at all, and in others, giv
ingbounties to promote it.
It was a usual obfdrvation of the celebrated
Boyle, that if every artiil would but discover what
new observations occurred to him in the exercise
of his proteflion, piiilofophy would thence gain
innumerable improvements. It may with equal
jnltice be observed, that if the nfeful knowlege
of every country, however barbarous, was glean
ed by a judicious observer, the advantages would
be ineilimable. Are there ilot, even in Europe,
many ufeful inventions known or praJtifed hut
in one place ? For instance, the inflrument used
lorcQtnng dÂ»vÂ»n corn in Germany, appears to be
much more handy and expeditious than the fickie
used in other countries. The cheap and expedi
tious manner of making vinegar without previous
fei mentation is known only in a part of France.
If such d ifcoveries remain Hill to be known at
home, what funds of knowledge might not be
collated in countries yet unexplored, or only
'pafledthrough by hafly travelling

Extra'l of a letter from Harwich, May 2.
"On Friday lad the nored r. u ,l Jones, lately
an Admiral in the Ruffian service, landed from a
*Boat at this place. Being dreiled in the
Ruffian uniform, his perfori was not recognized
till after his baggage was sent to the custom house
tor examination, when the outside directions of
rtne or two parcels caused the difcovcry. The
populace, having gained information of his arri
val, f nrrounded the inn where he was and were
not (paring in denouncing their resolution of ex
em ling vengeance upon him, if they laid hold of
himâln consequence of which he privately es
caped out of town the fame day.''
A comparative statement of the English and
Span!fix navy, made by a correspondent, and, we
Jincerely hope,ffounded in truth, makes the num
ber of the former 264, of the latter 145âa ma
jority of 119 in favor of Old England.
The 24th being the earliest day on which it is
expected that themertenger from Spain, with his
Catholic Majefly s answer to the renionflrances
of the British Ministry, can arrive, nothing cer

Spaniards can be pronounced.

This amendment was Â«ppofcd by Mr. Gerry and Mr. Burke,
on this ground ; that it carried with it the plaincft outlines of a
system to establish a court Prejs and court Gazette 1 To give this pa

of every other paper, if the admmiftration thought proper to do
(o, in cafe of any of thole contests and jarings, which often hap
pen between the admintliration and thepeople in a government

KEW-YORR, JULY 17, 1790.
The (hip Maryland, Cape. Rose, is arrived at
Georgetown from LondonâAccounts by this ves
sel are to 15 May.
011 the 2d of May, the inhabitants of Mar*-
attacked the citadel of chat place, af.er
iummoning M. Calvert, to surrenderâto which
he pel'fidioufly replied by a discharge of 12 pie
ces of cannon, which killed twenty-two persons.
The place was immediately ailaulted and carried.
The garrison, confilting of 5000 men, laid down
their arms. M. Calvert was hanged in the breach
and his head stuck on a pole and carried through
the city. Four hundred and seventeen perlong
loft their lives in this affair.
The gabelles, or monopoly of fait, being novr
fupprelled by the National Assembly of France,
our vessels returning from that country, will be
free to purchase fait in any port. Some little
time will probably be neceflary to reduce it to
its just price. M. Richier, a member of the Af
femhjy, said in the debate on the fubjedt, that it
was so abundant on the coasts of that kingdom,
as to be worth but about a denier the French
pound, which would be about 7 cents the Ameri
can hundred weight.
ExtraCl of a letter froj/t Stocfbridge, July 9.
The Commissioners from the State ofVermont
have been here, agreeable to appointmentâbut
the gemlenieu from Albany not attendingâand
there being only one Commillioner from the State
of New-York, they were under the necpility of
adjourning without doing any thing further than
agreeing to meet on the 27th Sept. next, either
at New-York or Bennington, which place, to be
agreed upon.
A correspondent obferves,that evasions and non
payments of duties are to be ekpedted in all coun
triesâevery law relative to this fubjetfl is predi
cated on this principle.âThe inducemsnts to
ftnuggle are always in proportion to the savings
that may be made by the practice. It is there
fore afubjetfl of serious enquiry, Whether it will
be good policy to enhance the present rate of im
polt ? especially, if it is a facft, as has been fre
quently allerted, that the duties on many articles
are now complained of. The mercantile iniereft
has evinced its patriotism by a cordial fubmiilion
to the laws, and a prompt payment of the duties.
The infinite importance of commerce has been
by this means demonltratedâas under its auspi
ces we mayjultly be said to enjoy the richest
bleflings of life, peace, and good government â
but whileinnumerablefourcesof revenue remain
unexplored, is it not killing the Goose to get the
Golde;; Egg, re make an iridition to the ln;"polt f
The mercantile interest lias been unfavorably
contrasted with the landed interest in the House
of Representativesâbut there does not appear so
much confidence in the patriotism of the latter aa
to induce government to apply to that source for
any part of the revenue. This is not doing jus
tice to either, as we have abundant evidence to
(hew that both are on a par in their attachment
to the principles ofhonelty and patriotifu'i.
Every civilized nation in the woila has found
the utility of instituting and perpetuating anni
verf.iry commemorations of past eventsâmany of
these, however, have owed their rife to trifling
and unimportant incidents. But the anniverf u y
of independence, is a Day, consecrated to ilie
celebration of an event, that has raised human
nature at least one grade higher in the scale of
exiitence.
In every part of the United States this glorious
anniversary has been celebrated wkh afpirit un
known to our former days of annual feftivity and
joyâa laudable emulative military spirit has been
displayed, while the powers of Oratory, and the
devout exercises of religious worship, have uni
ted, to aid and promote the glary of the day !
A correspondent observes that the general fen
titnent is most clearly to be ascertained from the
public social a(fts of the people.â'A reference to
the late celebration of Independence through the
Union, will forcibly impress this idea, That the
Constitution of the United States is considered as
the palladium of their civil rightsâand that the
government is venerated by the citizens of the
whole Union.

" Before you receive this letter, hortilities be
tween this country and Spain, will commence; in
which the latter (as you may colletftfrom the pa
pers which go by the Packet) is the aggteflor, ha
ving taken five out of seven British veflels, tra
ding between the North-Weft Coast of America
and the East-Indies. A general war is expected,
as well as another, artonifhing and unexpected,
revolution in America. We were never more for
midable, either in power or unanimity. The
general voice of England has, without waiting for
the Royal Proclamation, denounced war and de
ftrudlion against that branch ofthe Houfeoj Bour
bon, now weakened and divided, through a glori
ous struggle to eftablilh the equal and natural
rights of man. The King of Spain, it is alledged
has made some powerful alliance to enable him,
in this crisis, to oppose the Britfh fleet, strength,
and resources. Our Stud-jobbers in the Alley,
however, have formed for him, in one day, alli
ances numerous enough to vanquish the world ;
but the next day, have been civil and cuirttous in
another extreme, reducing his native sovereignty
into a commonwealth, and diverting him of his
dominions in South-America.âHowever, theEn
glifli fleet is in motion. Ships are daily despatch
ed on secret expeditions, and the officers and
men are reported to be unusually sanguine for
a&ion. How, or when this commotion may ter
minate, is out of the reach of hfuman coniprehen
lion : But we may conclude, with certainty, that
the produce of your country will command a
great price during its continuance; and that
Heaven may prosper you on this, as well as 011 e
