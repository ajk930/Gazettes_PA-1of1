DISCOURSES ON DAVILA. No. XV.
First follow nature and your judgment frame
By her just ftaodard which isftill the fame.
THE world grows more enlightened : Know
ledge is more equally diffused -â¢ News pa
pers, Magazines, and circulating libraries, have
made mankind wil'er : Titles ai*d diltinitions,
ranks and orders, parade and ceremony, are all
going out of fafhion. This is roundly and fre
quently asserted in the streets, and foinetimes on
theatres of higher rank. Some truth there is in
it : and if the opportunity were temperately im
proved, to the reformation of abuses, the rectifi
cation of errors, and the diflipation of pernicious
prejudices, a great advantage it might be. But,
on the other hand, falfe inferences may be
drawn from it, which may make mankind wiih
for the age of Dragons, Giants and Fairies. If
all decorum, discipline and fubordir.ation arc to
be destroyed, and universal pyrrhonifin, anarchy,
and insecurity of property are to be introduced,
nations will soon vifh their books in allies, seek
for darkness and ignorance, faperftition and fa
viaticifrn, as bleHzngs, and follow the standard of
the firft mad despot who, wuli the enthusiasm of
another Mahomet, will endeavour to obtain them.
Are riches, honors and beauty g'->ing out of
f.ilhion ? Is not the rage for them, on the contra
ry, increased fafter than improvement, iÂ« know
ledge ? As long as either of these arc in vogue,
will there not be emulations and rivalries ? Does
not the increase of knowledge in any man, ia
creafe his emulation ; and the diffusion of know
ledge among men, multiply rivalries ? Has the
progress of faience, arts and letters, yet difiover
ed that there are no passions in human nature ?
No ambition, avarice and a desire of lame ? Are
these pailions cooled,diminished or extinguished ?
Is the rage for admiration less ardent in men or
â¢women ' Have these propenfitieslefs a tendency
Cty -divjfi&ns, cÂ«ntrÂ»*Â«Â»f.i |, Seditions, rau;.;>iis,
and civil wars, than formerly ? On the contrary,
the more knowledge is difFufed, the more the
pailions are extended, and the more fijrioui tliey
grow ? Had Cicero less vanity, or Celar lei's am
bition, for their vast erudition ? Had the King
Â«fPrulfia less of one, than the other ? I here is
no connection in the mind between science and
paflion, by which the former can extinguijh or
diminish the latter : it on the contrary Sometimes
increases them, by giving them exercise. Were
the pailions of the Romans less vivid, in the age
of Ponipey, than in the lime of Mummius ? Are
those of the Britons, more moderate at this hour
than in the reigns of the Tndors ? Are the paili
ons ol Monks, the weaker forall their learning ?
Are not jealousy, envy, hatred, malice and re
â venge, as well as emulation and ambition, as ran
corous in the cells of Carmelites, as in the courts
of Princes ? Goto the Royal Society of London :
is there less emulation for the chair of Sir Isaac
Newton, than there was, and commonly will be
for all elective presidencies i Is there less animo
lity and rancour, arising from mutual emulations
in that region of science, than there is among
the inoft ignorant of mankind ? Go to Paris :
how do you find the men of letters ? United,
friendly, harmonious, ineek, humble, modest,
charitable? prompt to mutual forbearance .' un
ofl'uming ? ready to acknowledge superior me
rit ? zealous to encourage the firft symptoms ol
genius ? Alk Voltaire and Piolieau, Marrnontel
and De Mably.
The increase and diiTemination of knowledge,
instead of rendering unneceliary, the checks of
emulation and the balances of rivalry, in the or
ders of society and conftitntion of government,
augment the neceflity of both. It becomes the
more indispensable, that every man lhouldknow
his place and be made to keep it. Bad men increase
in knowledge as fall as good men, and science,
arts, taste, sense and letters, are employed for
the purpoies of iniuftice and tyranny, as well as
those of law and liberty : fÂ»r corruption as well
as for virtue.
Frenchmen ! Ast and ihink like youifclves !
confefling human nature, be magnanimous and
wife. Acknowledging and boalting yourselves
to be inen, avow the feelings of men. The af
ic&ation of being exempted from passions, is in
liuman. The grave pretention to such fingulaii
ty is solemn hypocrisy. Bouh are unworthy of
your frank and generous natures. Consider that
government is intended to set bounds to pafSor.s

INSTRUCTIONS KOR THE COLONIES,
Presented to the National Afitmbly, in the name of
the Committee appointed Jor that purpose, the 23 d
March, I 790.
By Mr. Barnavi, Deputy from Dauphiny.
CON T I N U 18.
THESE forms being agreed upon, the Nation,
a! Afl'embly should point one the measures
which ought to bepurfued, to putthem in execu
tion
The most prompt and moll simple appear to be
the belt; transcription, publication and the autho
rity ofitribunals, are in general, means little fui
tablfc to the eftablilhiiient of representative ailem
blies. They would suit ltill less in the present
circumstances.
It has appeared to the National Aflembly, that
the diligence of the governor ot each colony, fe
curedby the vigilance ofthe citizens, and by his
responsibility, is fuflicient to forward proclama
tions, and fix up in all the parilhes, its decrees
and inllrucftions.
This form being accomplished, the decrees and
inftrudiiotis being authentically known, the zeal
and understanding of the citizens will secure their
execution. ,
They will of tliemfelves form into parochial
aflembliesâthey will verify those who fulfil the
conditions required to vote thereinâthey will
calculate the number to ascertain that of the de
puties .bey ought to fend to the colonial aflembly ;
they will in short eledt these deputies, who shall
immediately repair to the central town, pointed
out in this inftrutftion, and who, in concert, will
there form the colonial aflembly, or will transfer
it to such placf as fliall appear most suitable to
C The only difficulties which can arise, will be
I such as relate to the colonial aflemblies already
[ farmed and existing in some ofthe colonies.
529
If tliefe aflemblies after being informed of the
decrees and inftruftions of the National AHem
bly, conceive that the forming a new a-flbmbly, ru
conformity to these inftrudtions, is snore advan
tageous to the colony than their own continuati
on, there is no doubt but that their declaration
will be perfectly fufficient, and that they will
immediately proceed to new eleifiions.
But if they are not of this opinion, it will be
their business to colledt the sentiments of the in
habitants in this refpe<ft.
The National Auembly lias announced that
thele aflemblies can fulfil the funclions pointed
out by its decrees of the Bth March, whenever
they lhall have been duly ele<fted and avowed by
the citizens.
Far from having by this disposition interditfled
rhe inhabitants of the colonies,the power of choo
sing between the existing aflemblies, and those
which may be formed, after the prefetit convoca
tion, the National Aflembly has on the contrary
implicitly exprcfled itfelf.
But even if it had not acknowledged this right,
they would have naturally poflefled itâand noth
ing could oblige either the metropolis or the
colony to treat together, by the intervention of
an aflembly which they themselves who had ele<ft
ed it, should not acknowledge,.
The question then is to trace a form, agreea
ble to which this Â«ption may be speedily and
peaceably effed:ed.
This can only be accompli/lied by the deliber
ation of the pariflies.
It is neceflary therefore that each explains it
felf, and this objeÂ«sl of deliberation ought to be
the firft business of the parochial aflemblies.
In the space of fifteen days, after the procla
mation and fixing it up, they shall be bound to
announce their wiflies, and shall immediately for
ward them to the governor of the coloÂ«y, and the
colonial aflembly.
' Such as shall have decided in favor of forming
a new aflembly, shall not nominate their deputies
before the wishes of the majority has been ack
nowledged conformably to their opinion, for an
anticipated election would only tend to excite
troubles and Cornells.
As long as the wilh of the colony lhall not be
known, the existing colonial afletnbly may com
mence the business pointed out by the decree of
the National Aflemblyâbut it is evident that the
right of executing and provilionally modifying
the decrees of the National the mu
nicipalities, and the administrative aflemblies,
cannot belong to it, before the voice of the parilh
es has confirmed its powers and existence.
After the titne has elapsed, when ail the paro
chial assemblies lhall have explained themfelve#
on this head, the governor lhall notify in the molt
public manner, the result of the deliberations
which thall have come to hand, and lhall give
each pariih a particular and authentic acknow
ledgment of it.
If the majority of the fuffrages of the pariihea
which lhall have deliberated demands the forma
tion of a new afletnbly it will clearly follow that:
the existing afiembly is not avowed and authori
zed by the colonyâits powers (hall cease-"-it lhali
immediately proceed to the formation of a new
afiembly, agreeable to the forms indicated in this
inftro&ion, and confeouently all the parochial
afl'etnblies /hall proceed in the fame manner they*
would have done, if at the time of the firft pro
clamation no colonial afiembly had existed.
If on the contrary one half of the fuffrages of
the deliberating parishes vote for the continua
tion of the colonial atfembly, it shall bÂ« preserved.
and shall fully exercise the fun<stions and powers
attributed to it by the decree of the National As
sembly.
Thus, .time will not be uselessly con fumed, the
form freely admitted by the inhabitants for the
formation of their AiTembly will not be contra
venedâbut the powers shall be withdrawn or
confirmned, at the moment when new functions
and new circumstances, no longer admit of a foun
dation on tliofe which it formerly received, the
adhelion of the colony and the confidence of the
metropolis.
No doubts, no disorder, no dangerous delay can
result froiÂ» the observation of these forms, if the
colonists are penetrated with the idea that their
dearell interests and the most sacred duties of a
citizen oblige them to submit without a murmur
to the voice of the majority, if they perceive t,hat
promptitude and unanimity in the execution of
Â£Whole NO. 133.]Measures which are pointed out to tliem, can atone
happily extricate them out of the critical iituation
in which circumstances have placed them, that it is
their business instantly tÂ® secure, by a good consti
tution, the hopes whichtheyhaVe conceived, and
the advantages offered to them,, and that so far
from conducting them to-this end, the prolonga
tion of public fermentation will shortly surround
thein with such pressing and terrible danger, that
all the measures they may make to oppose them
will coine too late to secure them against these
effeds. (To be continued.)

PARIS, MARCH 8.
M. Rab.a-ud de St. Etienne's Speechj concluded
from our paper of\qth in-fi.
IN (hort gentlemen 1 repeat it, brcaufel am firm
ly convinced of it, that bankruptcy isimpolfi
fcle, because you are hereâand to effeift it, but
one mean exists, that is to separate you.
The Impojls it is said are not collectedâthey are
colleited throughout the greatest part of the king
dom, as your own correspondence gentlemen on
the subject will teftifyâfome indirect imports are
no longer collected ! This is true, but you are
offered, and there will be formed substitutes in
their place : You will eftablilh them, and the
people will adopt them, and will pay them with
pleasure. Unfortunate people, who lovetoferve
your country, and your king, without affectation,
what is your lot Opprcffion when you bend
your head, and calumny when you dare to raise ir.
Is there then no evil, it is aikedâare our fears
then chimerical ? There is one gentlemenâit is
greatâit is preflingâand yeu ought to remedy
itâthis evil is the scarcity of specie. The cause
of it is ealily pointed outâit is owing to too much
paper in circulation.â Seeing you know the cause
ofthe evil, you will find a remedy for it.
I take the liberty to invite you, to take imme
diately into consideration the ?ne?noria! of the firjl
minifler of the finances, that memorial which you
have been expecting this fortnight past, and the
adJrefs of the Commons of Parisâ¢ You will endea
vor to restore an equilibrium between specie and
paper, by givingat this timefome preponderance
to specie, and l'ome confidential allurement to
bring it into circulation again.
A thousand objects indeed press you, and the
people tre impatiently expecting the fruit of your
hiborâtout t)ie present evil is mod preflingâyou
will only quit for an inflant the obje<fts of your
indefatigable cares, to refuine them with great
er ease and fatisfatfiionâand disengaged from
the solicitude which opprcfles you, you willcom
pleat the Constitution with the more courage,
andfthe consolation you shall derive from it, will
renovate your vigor. The people of France
will second you with their patienceâthe enemies
ofthe public weal will find themselves deceived,
in calculating too lightly on the pretended incon
stancy of the French nation : The generous peo
ple of rhe capital, those brave companions of
your labors, will continue to fnpport themâthey
will find that by aidingand prefervingyou, they
preserve themselves, the King, the people, everv
good citizen, the creditors of the State,.the cap
ital and tlie province, all will have a common
cause, the fafety of the country, and the com
pletion of the constitution ; With this noble and
generous concert, I repeat once more gentlemen,
that bankruptcy is impojp.ble, and Fratrce cannotptrifij.

turbances in that Iftaitd, They beg-in on the

finally killed him. This creating an alarmâthe
mulattoes on duty, flint tbe gates of the fort, and
fired from the loop holes on tbofe who were out

tailed all the inhabitants tÂ® arms. A scene of
ravage hollility eafuedâand about nineteen of
the mulattoes and Whites'were butchered. The
American vefiieis were boarded, and all the jnili
tary weapons on board taken awayâwhich the
Vifconnt, de Ponteves offered to pay for. There
was not any firing from the navy, as was report
ed ; and the riot had subsided intirely when Capt.
Hasrts left the Island.
Dispatches were sent bv the Viscount t>E Pon-

We are authorized to fay, thst the information

Sketch of tbi Debate,- in Committee of the -whole on
the RESIDENCE BILL. '
MR. BURKE's motion under confutation which was
in fubllanceâThat the feat of government (hould remain in
ivew-York two years from last May ; and from the exp, ra
tion of that time to the year 1800, that the feat nf
(hould remain,n Philadelphia. Â° f S overnm ="t
Mr. Burke observed that he was induced to make this motion
from a wilhi to accommodate ; as a delegate from South-Carolina
he considered himfell a proper situation to come forward o'
his occasion ; the New-York and Pennsylvania member, are pa
ties concerned m the bnfinefs, they are judges in their own cause â¢
and in this view it may be expefled that they will be part"" to
their refpea,ve,nterefts_he therefore conceived that a mo on bl

Mr. Lawrstloe entered into a confiderMion of the pftttnfioiit
New-York, he laid (he had a claim to the feat of goveinmc
from the various circumstances which had attended the rcfideu'rl
from the time Congress fii ft came to this city, and trom the exer
tions which it had recently made ; Mr. Lawrance did not reier
particularly to the improvements of the city for the accommoda
tion of the government âhis observations were general, and rcf
pefted the policy and expediency of the measure.
Mr. Page opposed the amendment, he observed that as to the
claims of New-York he did not conceive that Ihe had any clsins
whatever, it is true fhc has put herfelf to considerable expence t.>
accommodate the government, and he was ready to acknowledcÂ»
her patriotism 0:1 this account, but said he, there is not a eity of
equal magnitude in the union that would not have done the (am- â¢
and (he is reimbursed by the advantages (he has derived, u
does rtceive by the money that is expended here in con'fequence â 
he said that the accommodation of the people at large ought to be'
a prime confid ration with the legislature, and in this view io a
void any riflt-rcfpeQirig the bill and to fix a business which li d Â»
much agitated the public mind, he lhould vote against the m -
tion. There is one argument indeed, said he, whieh deserves au
tention. I mean that which is founded on a supposition that the
bill is unconditional, and that this was the opinion of niy col
'eague on a former occasion. Sir, it was then my opinion al(o â¢
but we were then over ruled by this house, and now have the c
pinion of the Senate also, against our conftruftion of the conflin .
tion. âHowever, I rely not merely on this circumstance, for 1
find, upon an examination of all that the constitution fays about
an adjournment, that the clause in the bill is perfectly conftuu.
tional, as there are but twofentences in the constitution iifpÂ«&in e
adjournments. The last clause of the 3th fe&ion of ihe ill articli
and the 3d feflion of the jd article, the former of which runl
thus, " Neither house during the fellion ofCongrefs (hall, witho t
the consent of the other, adjourn for more than three days, nur iu
any other place than that in which the twohoufes (hall be fitting"
Now, fir, to be inconsistent with this clause of the constitution
the bill (hould direst that adjournments (hall take place withm t
the consent of the Senate, but the bill before us was framed by
the Senate, and a perfect concurrence of the three branches of the
legiftature is propoled to the adjournment now under considera
tion : how then can it be inconsistent with the 3d fe&ion of the
2d article of the constitution, whieh gives the President a right to
interfere in cafe of a disagreement refpefting the time of an ad
journment ? It might indeed be said upon a question conccrnii.g
common adjournments, that the two houses would do well to rt
tain the right of adjourning without the consent of the President:
âBut, fir, this is an extraordinary cafe, in which it will be'happr
for Congress and their conftitucnts if the business of adjournment
(hall depend upon the joint consent of the three branches of the
l'-giflaturr, and not on that of the two houses alone. Without
this check, after getting to Philadelphia, on an adjournment, we
mig'U be brought back to New-York, and then carried back a
gain ; and so on without end. I think, therefore, that the clause
in the bill is not only constitutional, but proper.
Mr. Tucker said he (hould move to divide the question ; but lie
had his objections to the palling a bill for a purpose which a
joint resolution was fully competent to effefling; his argument a
gainst the bill turned upon this idea, that Philadelphia would be
come the permanent residence, and this he conceived to be the
main ebjcQ ; for said he, it will become the duty of Pennsylvania,
to prevent Congress from ever leaving that city, if they (hall at the
expiration of the period of ten years think that Philadelphia is the
heft place in which to continue the feat of governmentâhe said he
was sorry to hear the arguments which had been brought forward
c:i this question refpefting losing the bill if it> was amended ; he
thought them calculated to abridge* fair leglhtive di!Â«u:Gon of
the mrritsof the fubjeft : Mr. Tucker spoke in handsome terms of
the citizens of New-York.
Mr Gerry was in favor of putting the question as ori<-itÂ»lH
moved--the complexion of the bill affects the temporary rt&
dence of Congress; to form a judgment of the amendment hl.
poled, " is neceDTary to take a *iew of the proportion as it HaiFi
in the bill : The state and city of New-York are differently situa
ted fiom any other place at which Congress ever fatâthe accom
modations of all other places at which Congress has ever fat have
been an appropriation of their public buildings. When ihe Con
ltitution was adopted, Congress determined that the'6ift meeting
(hould be in New-York ; and from this determination it became
necellary that accommodations (liould be provided. Haa not
New-York done this, they would have been charged win, parti
inony, or diUffcftion, or withboth. It would have been said that
, c "y having been a Britilh garrison were careless and indiffer
ent in refpeft to the government ; these considerations and their
attachment to the Constitution produced the elegant building in
which the ftftions of Congress have been held ; in addition 10 this
they have incurred other heavy expences to beautify and render
"or.' convenient the feat of government. These expcnces the city
as incurred to do honor to the new government, and they have
not been reimbursedâwill itnot then be considered as thehcighth
or ingratitude to quit this place under such circumlldnccs ?
Let us now consider the bill in a national point of view : He

" It ettmibf mfly be determined, whether the world
derives ntujl advantage from a great and virtuous mart,
before or after his death."
r I ""HOUGH 1 do not concur in the prevailing
X opinion, t hat we crtn form a julter idea of
the characters of persons after death, than while
they are living, 1 am nevertlielefs perl'uadcd that
rhe anions and virtues of worthy men should be
faithfully recorded and warmly celebrated.â
While a man lives, innumerable causes conspire
ro give atl improper coloring to his conduct.â
'J?he foibles and defe&s, interwoven in the lives
of men, spread a shade over their virtuous qua-
Sities, which obfeures their luitre and weakens
theforce of example. There is notaareat propor
tion of mankind, whose reputationftands so high
ssit deserves. But when the scene closes, and a
wan is no more to appear on the stage of human
affairs,'his enemies are scattered, and every source
of hatred and competition is annihilated. His
friends and relations draw the portrait, and give
it a most lively giÂ«w of perfediion. Thus'his
condtuft is exhibited as a model topofterity, while
his cotemporaries beheld it veiled with follies and
imperfections. Ic is however of admirable adr
â vantage that more fnifhed pi'fture 4 (houhl bÂ«

formed through the aid of imagination, than ex.
iil in real life.
Perhaps no circumstance Simulated the Romans
more vigorously to such virtues as they practised,
than the fame of their illustrious ancestors. This
was preserved in the image of their predeceflors
which were hung in the most conspicuous places
to catch the eye, and impress the most eager de
sire to imitation. The virtue of one generation
was transfufed intofeveral, and the original cha
rafter of that nation retained some of its leading
traits, even to its low stages of degeneracy. The
view of those venerable bu/los awakened a fpiri.
of heroism, at lead so far as to applaud the gen
erous actions of their forefathers. It cannot be
material in what mode the memory of illustrious
men is preserved. Bulls and Statues make per
haps stronger impreflions than historical records.
And as the object is rather to inspire the heart
with a general love of virtue, than to instruct us
in the details of our conduct, I (hould suppose
the force of example is more strongly alluring,
when <ve behold the image, than when we examine
the history of antient worthies. The latter of
these modes however is indispensable For other
reasons than touching the heart; but they both
i contribute to perpetuate the utility, and reward
the labors of great and virtuous characters.

FABLE.
THERE was a timeâ(no matter when,
Some fay 'twill soon return again)
When Leo, King of beads arose,
And dub'd his faithful fubjetts foes-
Spread devailation far and near,
Fire in the frontâdeath in the rear;
The peaceful tenants of the wood,
B) blood and carnage thus purfu'd,
Combind their force in federal bands,
And drove the murd'rers from their lands 3
The commonwealth to peace reftor'd,
And made the tyrant (heathethe sword.â
But now relieved from foreign dangers.
They on each other fcowl'd like strangers ;
Quarrel'd about each other's quota,
Nor car'd for credit an iotaâ
And having gain'd their independence,
All sense of common justice fend hence ;
Kick'd faith and honor out of dodrs,
And plung'd the state in civil wars;
Till tir'd with party's iron rei^n,
They wifh'd old Leo's paw again.
FROM A LOVDOM'PAPER
Things apparently the most infignificant and
useless in thenifelves, may be converted to pur
poses of a very beneficial nature, and may be ser
viceable both in manufaiflures and hulbandry.
Thus oyster and cockle (hells, when pulverized
by an inftrunient tor that purpose, which is fre
qitfftltly "Â»â¢ -ppgflsâ6i
and America, become 4 far better manure for
some kinds of land, mixed wirh lime, than per
haps any father whatever. On Long Island, near
New York, thfcy make a kind ef porcelain of
cockle fliells, after being ground and made into
a compoll, that is very pleafnig to the eye, and
large quantities are fabricated every year. The
common feathers of our do medic fowl are now
ingeuioufly prepare<}, and made into plumes for
the army, whilst the large and handlome feathers
of tnrkies are worked up in imitation of ostrich
plumes. Industry, aided by ingenuity, will find
aid from what had been heretofore deemed ofno
value ; for who indeed at a former period, could
have imagined that flint-ftones, joined to a par
ticular fpecieSof clay, would have formed a kind
of beautiful ware that now excels even the pro
ductions of China, which were once thought ini
mitable, and seemed a secret that would scarcely
ever be discovered by Europeans.

DiaÂ» SIR,
" T SHALL endeavour to answer your letter/methodicallyâand
1 in the Aril place do allure you, the report that we were obli
ged to movcto the city on account Â®f the Indians, was every part
thereof falfe, and without the lcail foundation. The Indians have
killed one man, and dole feme horses, which is all the mifebief
they have done on the purchase since my arrivalâthey appear to be
very friendly and to beir a great regard for the Yankics. as they
tall us.
I lived at the city the firft winter, and in the spring took up my
land at this place, and undertook with three others to build mills,
.vhich we have compleated, and they arc of the fir ft rate. I railed
last season about 100 bufheli of corn, some potatoes, turnips, &c.
I moved my family here last September, and have lived here ever
sinceâhave not been in the leaii disturbed. I have caught near
two barrels of filb, some fuckers, perch, zndpike; ha.c taken
pike here of 241b. they appear to be of the fame kind of the Pick
erel in New-Englandâl like my situation well, my land is ex
ceeding good. You wi(h to know the Cummer season ; it would
not be worth while to give yon a detail of every day ; let it fuffire
to fay, the summer season appears to be well calculated to nourish
the growth of the fruits of the earthâthe weather in the summer
is not warmer as I can pcrceive, than in New-England, but of
longer ouratioti. The bottom land is as heavy timbered in gene
ra), as the beach and rnapje land in Chcfter ; the hills are oak and
hickory, the most beautiful timber for building leverfaw. The
face of the wth is rtot Covered with stone* as in New-England,
but they appear to be in Quarrys, and are difcovcred upon the
fides of hills, and at the fides and bottom of creeks; they ar# almofl,
or entirely, either lime, or frce-ftone ; the free-ftone make as good
Â£rindftones as the Nova-Scotia stone, and are excellent for build
ingâwe have plenty of good clay. The boards the Joiners *fe
are yellow poplar, cherry and black walnut, of which there is great
plenty.
The hills are about one mile from the Ohio, at the mouth of
the Mufkingum, this is not all bottom land, part of it is what we
call second bottom, and part an oak plain. The land at or near
the point is flowed, I believe, oncea year at least, occasioned bv the
water of the Ohio and Mnlkingum overflowing their banks, they
being somewhat low; this is also the cafe with I'ome part of the
bottoms up the Mulkingum ; thrfe bottoms will not bear wheat at
present, (or they are by far too rich, but the plains and hills appear
to be excellent for wheat.
You request .o know bow-many families there is at or nrar Ma

A TRUE STORY.
Written by Dr. Franklin, to his Nephew.
I was a child, at seven years old, my
Â» Â» friends on a holliday filled my little pocket
with coppers. I went directly to a (hop where
they fold toys tor children ; and being charmed
with a fouud of a Whiflle that I met by the way, in
the hands of another boy, I voluntarily offered
and gave all my money for one. I then came
home, and went whiffling all over the house
much pleated with my Whijtle, but disturbing all
the family. My brothers and fillers, and cou
lms, understanding the bargain 1 had made, told
me I had given four times as much for it as it was
worth. This put me in mind what good things
I m'ght have bought with the reft of the money
and they laughed at me so much for my folly
that I cried with vexation ; and the reflection gave
me more chagrin than the Whittle gave me plea
sure. r
This however was afterwards of ufetonie, the
imprefTion continuing on my mind, so that often
when I was tempted to buy fo.ne unneceflkry

As X grew up, came into the world, and observ

friends, to attain it, I have said to my Mi, this
