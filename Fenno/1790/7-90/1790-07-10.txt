WE learn from WarsaW, tharthe Marquis de
Lucchefini, his PrufTian Majelty's Envoy,
has returned the 18th Feb. from Berlin, and in
the last place from Dresden. The ifl'ue ef his
liegociations are laid to be, that the eletftor ot
Saxony faithful to his principles of moderation
and wisdom which have hitherto secured the hap
piness of his fubjefts, will embrace the lyftem of
neutrality, in cafe of a rupture with Germanyâ
to render which respectable, he will arm himfelt,
which resolution is carrying into efFe.fl, by orders
for aflembling the Saxon army the beginning of
this month at Spremberg.
Extratt of a letter from Geneva, 27 Feb.
" Justice has at length prevailed over private
interest, and every other pallion, which in repub
lies induce one party to oppress the other. Such
of the representing party, as were still in exile,
have been restored to their former condition and
places, which they occupied before the revolu
tion of t 782. The proposition was at firft agreed
to in the council of two hundred. The lefler coun
cil adopted it nextâand the General Council (auc
tioned it by a plurality of 954 voices against 120.
When the news of this resolution was publilhed,
a general joy announced the common wish ot the
â¢whole city. This return of concord is regarded
in Geneva as the fruit of the French revolution.
They write from Berlin, the ad March, that by
virtue of a convention concluded with Poland,

Accounts from Brussels, 11 March
The Grand Duke of Tufcany has sent a memo
rial to the States of Brabant, exprelfing his disap
probation of the measures which led to the revo
lution, proposing a general amnesty, and terms
of reconciliation, grantingevery thing the States
formerly claimed from the late Emperor. Let
ters were also received from the Arch Dnchefs
Maria Cleriftina of Austria, and Duke Albert of
Saxe Tefchen, all which the States have ordered
to be printed and sent back to the General Cun
grefs. From the spirit which animates the Be!-
gic nation, there is no probability that the pro
portions, .however reasonable, will be attended
to.
Tlie'uifputes between rheofigf chy and demo
crarical party have in forae measure been com
promised. The form of the oath to be taken by
the volunteer companies has been so qualified
as to have been accepted by them. After taking
the oath the . Volunteers unaniinoufly elected
Duke d'Pvfel their commander in chief.

FEAR' GOD, AND HONOR THE KING,
were formerly among some oftlie firft leflons
taught our childrenâand doubtless a very ufeful
oneâto intlil thus early a jnft regard to the
protecting and ruling powers, is laying the bell'
foundation for an easy participation under their
genial influence.
The Americans under a government, so mild
and yet so equal, are indulged to exercise, unre
strained, every faculty they poflel's.âThe licen
tious perhaps, in such circumltances may have
far too much liberty, but the more virtuous un
der the fame, may Lmprjve and enjoy all that
men can wish, and freemen are heirs to. While
a people are lb unlimited in their pursuits, it is
not indeed unnatural they ihould form a system,
or scale to ad; upon, not diflimilar to their go
vernment ; and we have too melancholy proofs
of this in some of the States, to doubt the truth
of the observation, that an example from govern
ment of chicanery and repeated violations of
their moll: solemn engagements with the public,
and a want ot an honeit liability in their laws,
has the most direful effecl on individuals in their
private tranfatfiions with each other.âHence
the neceflity and ftimulous (if in a political view
only), for those who are so dignified as to com
pose the grand council of the nation, and on
whose deciiions so much is now depending, to
be the most exemplary in every step in their
private walks as well as public conduct âand to
weigh every motion, and its tendencies, (as well
what on firft view may appearto have a limited
efFedt, as those which aflame a bolder crell, ye
unexpectedly eud in vapour), with the utmoil
caution, gravity and confeious integrity ; and
pursue the most eligible, with a firmnefs becoiu
ing the fathers of a country. As it is the cha
racleriftic of our countrymen to seek for evi
517-
deuce, or at least a plausibility si o:h their own
reafonitig, of the ufef\ilnj?fs of a liieafure, before
they will acknowledge the lame as a child of
their ownâthis urges the neceility ofthe greater
circumfp'ftttion ; for they have not the most dil
tant idea of that prodigy in government,to believe
implicitly- (as is universally the cafe in the old
world) all is right, because the king, or their
own havedone it, andfo (hut the
door against enquiry Mid research ; one of
most gratifying, and probably one of the molt
ufeful privileges, to republicans, that we enjoy.
The consequent prejudices of a beaten track are
not yet erased, though it might indeed be sup
posed, that fields of clotted blood from our very
belt citizens, would now effectually cover every
trace of congeniality, and Tike the silent grave
lei jarate us forever from the least affinity, both
in laws, rules and manners to that country
which was once our greatelt pride to call, like
the pratling babe, mother, altho we had no real
wants.âTo this cause 1 am ready to impute one
ofthe groll'ell of errors, that darkens every page
in all our rules ot courtâalthough no people
ever had so fair an opportunity, to benefit from
leflonsof felf-experience, from every nation in
the world, and from many centuries paltâbut a
wilful blindness is sure the malady.
The greaiefl boalt of an Englishman is said to
be his 1 ight of rryal by juryâand in words pom
pous enough, the fame has been conveyed to us.
âIn theory it has an engaging appearance ; and
as it is sacred in its deciliou, I hold it in jufl elti
mation, and would not, a3 has certainly been the
cafe, that Lawyers, where lucre has been depend
ing on the iflue, and the verdidi has run counter
to their flatteringengagements with their clients,
fliould have their taunting scurrility to this higli
eft of all appeals, pass with impunity. To have
a cause depending on a jury, composed of my
own fellow citizens and neighbours, I cannot but
venerate the eftablilhment- ; but the juror's tryal
(for so 1 call it), without the right of appeal, I
hold in the u tut oft horror .ml dcteilaticnâfor it
surely is nothing lei's than a Baftile, barricaded
by the flrongeft injunctions of legal dignity.â
And in this lituation, twelve men, must, whether
right or wrong, deliver in their verdict without
one diflenting voiceâin the more solemn cases,
where life is depending, 1 do not so much con
demn the method ; even in such cases, I can.
not fee why a large majority could not be asfuf
ficient, as the present deciding modeâBut in
common cases, the propriety of room for a pro
portionate number of diflenting voices is evident
to thofewho know, that it is ainoralimpoflibility
for any promiscuous number of men to view the
fante* objects, through the fame medium ; there
fore allowances ought to be made, if any regard
may yet be had, to the lioneft scruples of the
conscientious manâwho in such a dilemma has
(for I Jo not doubt my informant) risked his life
in the violent hands ofthe affirming party j or
gorged through the throat of sensibility, acqui
esced in the award raised. by the very firft mem
ber, confident enough toftate the cafe nnder de
liberation in his own way, be it ever so absurd.
âHorrid iketch ! at this day, though no less
true, of the boasted and eftablifheu rules of
American courts of justice.
I wish most ardently, that as our supreme le
gislature are about forming courts, and rules of
courts, the few hints thrown out on this fuhjetfl,
may be adjusted as in their wisdom may appear
moll suitable to the genius of the people. It
must be their liigheft ambition and honor to go
vern well. LYCURGUS.

[Whole No. 130.]LONDON, Feb. 9.
IT is to be remarked, in justice to the Nuns of
Paris, and its environs, lb greatly libelled in
the speech of Mrs. Jouet, that, though the doors
Â«f their convent were thrown open, by the de
cree of the National Aflembly, to every Nun who
fliould please so return to society, only four avail
â¢'rxhenifelves of itâofthefe Mrs. Jouet was one.
When it was announced in their convents, that
the Nuns who (hould think proper to remain in
them might do so, they resolved to celebrate,
with a grand feftival, their joy, for the glad tid
ings that they were not to be forced from their
favorite cloilters. Accordingly high mass was
lung, and after it aTe Deum. From the palling
of the decree of the Aflembly, which put it in the
power of the Nuns to return to society, their fe
<ji"*ftration may be considered as voluntaryâand
as it cannot be luppofed that promises to women,
who, by remaining in their cloisters, can be ca
pable of any but conventual favours, and who can
have nothing to fear from threats but a rigid en
forceinent of the rules of the house, could influ
<nce the Nuns to facrifice their liberty, if they
tiad a wish to recover it, To it is to be prefomed
that Mrs. Jouet went a great deal too far when
Ihe stated that promises and threats had been used
to retain Nuns in their cloilters. Such promises
and threats, if they ever were used, had no effect
Upon her and three othersâwhy then was it to
be supposed that they operated so powerfully with
all the others, as to make them forego the wilhes
of their heart, and prefer the gloom of a cloirter
to the life and spirit of society ?
The order to which Mrs. Jouet belonged, was
extremely ufeful to society. Ihe Nuns who be
longed to it have an hospital, which they support
at their own expence, and where they attend the
lick in person.
The French Aflembly are determined to con
tinue themselves, without going back again to
their constituentsâFor this put pose, the follow
ing motion was made, and after some lliort de
bate, agreed to, last week.
" That whereas the constituents could not
give their Representatives power to form only a
part of the Constitutionâthat whereas the oath
taken on the 20th ofjunelaft by tl\e Representa
tives of the people, and which was approved of
afterwards by the nation at large, not to separ
ate until the great work of the Constitution should
have been completedâand that whereas the As
fembly cannot, at this moment, fix the period
â when it can fay that work has been completed,
tho it is far advanced, h hereby declares, that
the powers of the Representatives of the nation,
lliall and do remain in full force, until they shall
have been thoroughly formed, notwithllanding
any limitation fee to them by any body of con
lliruentsâand that as soon as the work of the
Constitution is compleated, the Aflembly will fix
the period of its own diflolution, and point out
the time when the constituents/hall proceed to
the election of another Aflembly."
Considering the unsettled state of affairs in
France, we cannot reasonably objed: to such a
motion, provided the Aflembly take care that it
be notconfidered as a precedentâother wife there
is an end to their conlfitution.
EDINBURGH, .Feb. 12
\efterday fen'night a point of honor was ter
'minated at Dublin by a melancholy iflue, between
Dr. Harding and Mr. Beanii/h, two Irifli gentle
men, and lately both Students ofPhyficat the
University of EdinburghâMr. Beamish was un
fortunately fliot through the body, and died a -
bout three o'clock. The dispute in which this
unfortunate quarrel was grounded, occured at
Edinburgh, on the 4th of June last, when Dr.
Harding, the party who received the offence,
being then about to take out his degrees, did not,
from prudential motives, demand farisfatfionâ
his. journey to Ireland is said to have been prin
cipally excited with a view to this purpose. The
unfortuhate Mr. Beamish received a mortal
â¢wound in the body, from the firft fire of his an
tagonist, and fell without discharging his pistol.
Dr. Harding and his second hurried immediate
ly off the ground, and are fuppafed to have fail

the place carried back the expired Mr. Beami/h

Presumptuous feelings no less than abject oneÂ»

rather inclined to believe the natural propensity

This conclufiou easily offers itfelf from the confi

the prevalence of superstition, given a mod riojd
adherence to forms and ceremonies,of which they
could neither comprehend or explain any ration

If the comparative benefits or injuries, that

that if there were no men of a contrary character

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
THURSDAY, JUNE ?.
THE report of the committee on fuc petition of J. F, Amelung
on motion of Mr. Carroll was read the second time tins re
?Â»ori was in favor ot the petitioner so far as to loan him 8000 dol
ars
Mr. Carroll gave ajiiftory of the rife ond progrrfs of this gen.
"tleman'stxertions in cftabfifhingan American glass manufactory
it commenced in 1775 ; he brought into the country upwards of
200 persons, and has expended in thisundertaking 50,060 pounds
Owing to a variety of accidents, and particularly the ejttraoidtnary
wfe in the price of grain, he now finds himfclf greatly embar
rassed in prosecuting the business. but if he can be so far pa ronized
by government as 10 be favored with a loan (tf 3or 4000 pounds
It would afford him such relief, as would enable liim to surmount
every difficulty.
Mr. Smith (S. C.) and Mr. Sherman objected to trie report of
the commitlec, they doubled the constitutionality of the power of
Congress to loan the roone^of r their ctrnftiamji, t h- v -.fry A, rf
J? Â«0 Â»c<o'unt of the precjA. wit would JE&lCand fuppofcd
â¢hat the encouragem:ht and alTirtance would be applied for with
more propriety to the State government. '
Mr. Carroll made some obfctvations in reply \o rhefe remarkt
Mr. Vinmg said he had no idea of losing a good thing left a
precedent (hiuld he which no future circumstances
might probably call into use. He then adverted to the extraordi
nary and peculiar circumstances of this gentleman, and on gene
raln.tional principles contended that it was conformable to the
dictates of the soundest policy to encourage and aflift the under
taking.âHe said that the constitution does not prohibit thegovern
meni from loaning money, it is a meer ast of legifiation, and
Congress may do it, or let it alone. Congress are vetted with a
general power to encourage the arts and manufafturej of the Uni
ted States ; this is on; inodeof affording this encouragement â¢ he
enlarged on the itnpnitance of manufactures and that of makine '
glass in particular, by which if duly encouraged imroenH futnj oj
money are prevented from being sent out of the country.
Mr. Boudinot, who was one of the committee which brought in
the report, gave an account of the manufactory, and said he had
ken ot the glass made in It, which was superior to any ever before
produced in Am. ri ( a.âHo contended that Congress had a ri*h'
by tne constitution to loan the money ; he cited frveral inflates
in pbmtâwhich, said he, are unconftiiutional if this propo
rtion uâHe expatiated on the merits of the petitioner, in em
barking such large property in prof<cuting a bulincfsof lo general
utilitj, and pointed out the confeqm-nces which would rrfuli from
â¢ failure of thia application, which would be greatly mjmious to
the petitioner and the public.
I(Ir. Sherman read that part of the constitution which he con
ceived was contrary to the propofitton in the leporr.
Mr. Sedgwick said he had no doubt of the conflituliin.ility of
the meafurc in granting the moncv, Hill he doubted the eligibility
of any partial application of ihc put>lic patronage ,>nd encourage
ment; he mentioned the various manufacturing entcmriscs on
toot through the United States, manv of these ore langniftiing said
he, for want of that encouragcmrpt which is now foiieitcd in tb>>
particular infkanceâhe fiid lie Jiad no doubt of rhe merits of the
petitioner; and although he was in favor of giving oil due en
couragement to indubious foreign. rs, yet he douhtrd the pro
priety of doing this in a paitial manner, and in ores, icn. e ro th;
" wl ' _ y ; .f iT:rTâ Â»; a ft.OllU4 i>c bn#*j<-hi forwaid
on general principles said he, it IWild receive my hearty fupuort,
lu f.r as the tircumftancrs of the country would admii.
Mr. Aines entered into a particular difaifli m of the fubjeft of
manufactures, dilated on their utility and importance in ihe Uni
ted States ; he pointed out the difficulties which attended fctting
them up in this country,from the competition they have to contend
â with of (oieign articlesâhe then dated the principle" on which
public patronage ought to be extended to undertakings in this line
---his idea was that Inch as are of general advantage to the public,
lhould b. (o far sncouraged as to place the manofaSures upon
terms of equality wth foreign manulaaures of a fcmilar natnre ;
he d'd not conceive the prrfent circuinllances of the United States
would juftify or enable them to undertake to afford this encour
agement generally, but he<fuppofed that there waa a propriety in
taking up particular branches, and determining what Darlicular
aid they shall rec< ive.
Mr. Jackson wasoppofed to the report, he was avcrfe to any
partial encouragementâparticularly of foreigners in preference to
oui own citizens, whose circuniftances are in many refpefts truly
deplorable from the failure of manufactures, which had long been
efldbli/hod in the country \ he observed that our creditors had a
prior claim on the revenue,and that the mcafurc was precipitate.
G-.nrlenun are not content said he with placing the American
tonnage in a hot bed, but they are now for placing mannfaftures
ttlfo in one ; he supposed the State of Maryland would derive
great advantage from this undertaking and that they would en
tourage the petitioner without doubt ; he wished the gentleman
fnceefs, but was for referr ng him to the State legiflaturc.
Mr. Scney fuppoi ted of the committee and urged the
propriety of the application to the general government, as the un
dertaking is of general utility* and such extraordinary exertions
merited the notice patronage and afliftance of the United States
at large. â¢
Mr. Gerry after a varietv of other observations said the agri
cultural and commercial intcrefts of the United States had found
â warm advocatts in the House ; manufattures had found some
ii tends, but he believed, not to so great a degree as the other two ;
ne wished that some mode could be devised to unite in meafurcs
to promote the interests of all three.âHe concluded by saving
that as there appeared to be a variety of sentiments on the fui>je&,
he wished the houle ihouid go inio a cpmmittee of she whole on
tnc bufmefs. ' Mr. Stone made some observations in favor of
the report.
Mr Smith (S.C.) replied to the fevcral speakers in favor of the
Teport he reprobated the resolution, as uuconllitmionalâas open
ing a door to innumerable applicationsâhe contended that there
was no probability ot etfc&ual and certain aid to the manufac
ture, as it is acknowledged that Â«0,000 pounds has been employed
in the undertaking, yet it is in danger of failing ;he then read
an advertlfcraejit of Mr. Amelung in which he fays he is ftiil able
to birnifh the public with giafs. He obfeivcd that all cir
cumihnces he was led to'conclude that if the money was once
granted, it would never be again realized by the government, as in
cafe of accidcnts which arc very probable in that bulnu fs, Con
is will be applied to, on account of misfortunes to remit their
demand. This report was negatived.

The motion being negatived, and the bill being gone throu 2 h

Mr. Goodhue of the committee appointed to prepare and re
port amendments to the collection law, brought in a report enti
tled a bill to regulate the colleSion of duties imposed by law on
goods, wares, and Merchandize, imported into the United States
and on the tonnage ofShips orvcdels ; which was read and made
the order of the day for Monday next.
The amendments'of the Senate to the Poft-Office bill, were taken
into connderauon.
The firft amendment was to strike out the fir ft and second feci
t.om which Ipec.fied ând eft.blifhed the (everal roads, and to in
fm aclaufe .mpowenng the Poft-M.ftrr-Gener.l, under d,reft,on
of the President of the United States to ellablilh them.
A concurrt neein this amendment was oppoled by MelTrs. Blood
worth, White, Steele, Livcrmore, Hartley and Gerry.
It was, (ud that it was delegating the power of legillation to the
jupreme executive in one of the moll important points that could
? The revenue also will centre in the hands of the
executive; and in process ot time this revenue may be converted
into jn Engine d< ftruftive to the liberties of the United States ; for
as it is a perpetual law, and as the time may, and probably will
come, when the executive may be cori upt; as the revenue energ
ies, l nr olncersot the department wtll be encreafed, and we do
not know to what extent the consequences may be carried. It i s
"nconlli'utional, as that expressly refewes the power of eftablilh
ing Poll-Offices and P.A-Ro,d. to . >, J, wal fw .
:,ier obfcrvtd it would be throwiag j burden upon the President
which he cannot execute with any convenience to'himfelf, and
Ironi hf situation, with fatisfaftion to the people. The reprefcnt
atwes of the people who come from all parts of the United States
mull be supposed to have a more competent knowledge of the
proper places for eftablilhing Poll-Roads than the Post-Master-
Getieral.
was advocated by Mr. Partridge, and Mr.Sedg-
It was said that upon an accurate calculation it was found that
the roads proposed by the bill as it passed the houfc, are so numer
ous that so far from affording a revenue, they will prove a great
burden to the United States ? The circumstances of the country
are continually changing ; the feats of government in the several
itates are removed from their ancient situations to 100 miles dis
tance ; to accommodate the people in such cases, old routs must be
discontinued and new roads opened, which will be a perpetual
source of Legislation and unnecelTary expeoce. This bull nets was
left to the Post-Master-General by the late Congress, and verv
few complaints were heardâthe Post-Master-General by his of
fice mull be the moll competent judge, as the business will be a
principal object of his attention, and attual surveys of the roads
will be made by hisafliftant in all parts of the United States ; but
if the responsibility of this officer is divided into 65 parts, every
one of which has its own particular convenience in view, 1t must
appear evident, that all responsibility is entirely diflipatcd ; as to
the unconftitutionality, it was said, that the bill proposes no
more in the present instance, than is provided for in the other
executive departments ; the principles of conducing the business
are established by the Houseâ-the mode of carrying those prin
ci pies into execution is left with the executive; and this of ne
ceflity is done in almost every cafe whatever.âThe House ad
journed without coming to a otc.
FRIDAY, JULY 9.
The amendment proposed by the Senate to the bill making
further provision for paying the invalid pensioners of die United
States was agreed toby the House.
A meflage was received frÂ«m ihe Senate informing the House
that they have paflfed a bill providing for the regulation and go
vernment of seamen in the merchants service with amendments,
the bill to reguJate the trade and intercom* fe with the Indian tribes
â and the hill providing tor the settlement of the account* between
the United States and individnal States with amendments.

NEW-YORK, JULY 10, 1790.
The anmverfary of independence was cele
brated at Philadelphia with peculiar propriety *
It being Sunday, the society of the Cincinnati
formed themselves into a body, preceded by
his Excellency Governor Mifflin their Presi
dent, and the Hon. Thomas Mc'Kean, Vice-
Hrefidentâand being joined by the corporation,
of the city with other civil an d military officers
and a large concourse of refpetfable citizens-1
walked in procession to Christ Church, and there
attended divine serviceâ Dotfor William Smith
delivered a moll excellent difcohrfe adapted to
? n Monday the society alien,bled
and elected their officers for the ensuing year
mn G ft 7, S fr at Philadelphia, exhibited a
molt splendid scene on the anjiiverfary of inde
pendence. 1
As there is not a surplusage of chararter* i*
any country competent to tranfarting the public
affairs thereof-,t ,s evident that the idea of ro
tation in office, ,f frequently recurred to, nrift
deprive the people of the bed abilities of the
countryâthose matured by experience
Is it not demonstrable that those paris of the
country wh.ch are represented by men long cop
verfant in public affairs, jnult enjoy ftrikina ad
vantages over those whose concerns are commit
ted on the principles of rotations, to a new fee
of hands at every eletflion.
While public chararters ftould f*el their de
pendence on the good will, and free fuffraees of
the.r constituents-it is little short of political
"ic f Â° r *}} e people to deprive themselves of
approved abilities on the plausible, but oft de
cepuve principle of rotation.

m ndments in the constitution of this (late ; it is hereby declared
and ordained. That the government lhall be adm.oiftered as
heretofore, until the meeting and filling of the legislature, to be
held under this constitution.
a And whereas tlie existing laws, render it highly inconveni
ent for the legislature to meet on the fourth Monday m Novem
ber next, it is therefore ordained, that infl-ad thereof, tbe mem
bers of the senate and house ot reprefeniatives, to be eUfted on the
' second Monday ... Â©Sober, and on the day following, lhall meet

books, which balance (hall be led f din the ireafurcrs office n Co

a It is the opinion of this convention, that the legislature at the

TOWARDS the close of the late war, a Dutch
ship, mounting 74 g uns > having on board
her supply of men, as Ihe lay at her mooring in
the harbor of Currfcoa, one of the Weft India
lflands, was ftiddenly blown up ; the circumstan
ces of which are as follows : the gunner ot the
aforefaid ship, (to whom was committed the care
of the magazine, which contributed greatly to
the security of his design) was, for fonie inifde
8i can or or other, that fatal morn, to receive a
OBDURACT.
dozen lashes with a rope's endâbut being
ouily actuated by an hellilh dehre ot revenge, lie
conceived the dreadful notion of conimunieating
fire to the magazine ; in order wheieu
procured a match, with which, in a victorious
manner, he marched directly to the powder
confiding of two hundred barrels ; on his wa}
thither he wis met by one oi the cabbiu y ,
(he being the only person preserved whereby
the circumstances of this horrid affair were bro t
to light) whole curiosity having led him to en
quire whither l)e was bound with a lighted match,
received this aftonifliing anfvver, Â« We are all
going, by a sudden roaring gale, to land very
speedily in the fafe port of the infernal pit,
where, it is probable, we (hall make a warm
breakfaft." Whereupon the boy, miftruftiug
his bad design, call himfelf out at the nearelt
port-hole, and continued fwimmg under water
till his breath was nearly spent, and at the time
of his appearance the fliip was blown up, attend
ed with thunderingdevaftation which was per
ceived in part, bv the damage done to several ot
the nearelt buildingsânot to mention the man
gled limbs ofthofo belonging to the /hip, which
were afterwards picked up about the iflarnl. -
Thus through the revenge and impenitencc of
one bold wretch, 500 fouls were summoned be
fore the dreadful bar of God, in an hour which
they thought not of.

* This Journal contains the proclamation mentioned in the St. K'fts
Rajftenc Paferâwhich turns out to be nothing more than tic Bnt jh
King's mejftge received here by the Packet feme weeks jince.
Last night a very hot press took place in the
Road and Harbor oPs>t. John. Wc hear that up
wards of* 100 Seamen were collected from the
different ships.
FOR THE GAZETTE OF THE. UNITED ST.fTES.
THERE are many pcrfons who boast of their
moral virtile, honelt principles, and heroic
fortitude, that have not afingle ray of the above
named prdj>erties, in their homogeneous mass,
that illumes and brightens the human foul :
tbofemoft deficient in virtue and the noble prin
ciples which dignify the man, are the molt apt
to swell the zephyrs with their own fame.
This is a great mark of vanity, strong proof of
want of common fenfe,and fufficiently evincive of
misapplied education on an unvirtuous mindâ
" virtue without knowledge makes er.thufiafts ;
and knowledge without virtue makes devils ; but
both united, elevate to the top of human dignity
andÂ»perfe<ftion."
Universal felj-approbation, arises from igno
ranee and euthufiafmâand universally defaming
and reprobating the public and private conducfi,
is a species of opprobium that Hows from an ireful
and corrupted Source ; those that drink deep of
this fountain will be tinged with such slandering
principles, as the water of time cannot cleanl'e
and purify; therefore avoid depravity in the
dress of honesty, for it may delude innocence
and corrupt virtue itfelf.
Disappointed ambition, connetfied with a vin
dictive lpirit makes a reprobate.
May not wjcJleihiers and ignorance, together
with certain physical causes on the moral facul
ty, or total absence of the moral faculty, be just
ly considered the parents of cowardice ?
A certain philosopher of the present age, in
his philosophical oration, or enquiry intothe in
fluence of physical causes on the moral faculty,
has given the history of the celebrated Servins
character, and there appears to be a total absence
of the moral faculty, while the chnfm, produced
thereby in his mind,feems to have been filled up
by a more than common extension of every other
power of his mind ; he was treacherousâcoward/j
âdeceitfulâa liar, and blasphemer, &c produ
ced in consequence of the loss of the moral fa
culty.
