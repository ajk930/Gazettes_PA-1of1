" "\7"OU will douhtlefs be informed, if yoi
X do not fee the News Papers from thi
quarter, that the demon of discord is exceeding
]y bufyat this time ; the proceedings of oar Na
tional Legislature, being faulted by many impa
tient persons, gives occasion to a few candidates
for public noticc, to traduce the general govern
ment in a way that indicates what fort of materi-
als the fcriblers arc composed of.âMy reliance
is on the firmnefs, diiintereltednefs and patriot
ifni of a majority of Congreli. When I was at
New-York, similar remarks to those published in
the papers, were often made l>y persons whom I
found either unfriendly to the or
destitute of a proper idea of a free constitution.
âI remember particularly being one day in the
gallery, a member rose at the close of a debate
which had been continued through the whole
forenoon, and made afpeech of about 10 minutes
lengthâl thought very much to the purpose ;
but a man who lat next ine, appeared to beÂ» in a
perfecft agony of impatienceâand expreiled him
-I'cH in such a manner as convinced ine that if he
could have had his will, the member would have
been precluded from offering his fentimeuts on
the fabje<fl.âl just observed, " that ina free af
lembly every member had arighttogive his opi
nion ; and if controuled as to the time, or mode
speaking, there was an end to all freedom of
debate." i tell some of my unealy friends that
â¢ "\patience mufi have iis pujefl "work."âthat how
ever, there is oneway of lhortcning the ieflionsof
Congress, and presenting long speeches, which
the people can adopt, ana but oneâand that is to
change the government from a free republic to a
dtfptufniâbut would this be an alteration for
the better ? The Legiflaturc of the Unired States
is composed of cbaratilers, feletfted from the peo
preTrrrb "as much coolness, and freedom from
party influence, as any that will perhaps ever be
chosen. According to all the oblervations that
I have been able to make here, from the print
ed accounts, or from being an eye-witness, there
is an evident folicitudc to promote the general
interest of the Unionâbut every man knows,
who knows any thing, that it is in the power of
one or two individuals in a free aflsmbly, to
protract and embarral's their proceedings âit is
also to be considered that Congress have as it
were but a " choice ot difficulties"âand their
-ficuation is different perhaps from that of any
Legislature that ever existed before. A ftrflion
in the politicaL liiltory of America, even of a
.year, is but a point of time , and if the relult ol
. Congreilioiial deliberations atthis important peri
od, Ihould be a judicious fyilein of finance, what
ever may be the present sentiment, posterity will
beflow ajuft tribute of applause on their decilions.
We regret very much that it is thought necef
fury to bring forward the subject of residence
againâand fouie people talk very strangely ;
however, it to be considered that this and
every other qucftion can be introduced at the
pleai'ure of one or two members, and much more
so at the iuftance of a whole State i and there
tore to fay that such things lhall not be, is to fay,
we will not fubmitto a free government. I wilh
the business was once fairly fettled, that all fcon

ten refiet r ted on the observation of a gentleman
who had had long-experience of human nature,
in public lifeâthe new Constitution," said he,
nppfcais to tie agreeable in theoryâthe people
are greatly elated at the profpedl which presents
JlfeU to their imaginationâbut a Constitution is
Â«,nt thing, niitl the administration of it is another ;
those who will be ele<fted into public office will
a trying timeâand it will be well if . the
Constitution Â»s not made to share the blame with
the administration, of all the real or imaginary

HOUSE OF REPRLSEN TA 1 IVES.
TUESDAY, JULY 6.
Sketch of the Debate, in Committee of the -whole, on
the RESIDENCE DILL.
MR. SHERMAN : A3 this bill refpe&s the
permanent refideuce of the government,
which is an important fubjecftâit ought to be a
matterof enquiry, Whether the place proposed is
the real centre of population and territory or not.
He thought that it was too far southward. He
moved therefore that the Potowmac {hould be
(truck out, and a diftritft to include the town of
Baltimore, beinferted.
Mr. Burke seconded this motion
Mr. Lee deftred the gei tleman to inforrri the
committee where he mean; the temporary refi
denee (hould be, provided liis motion fhonld ob
tain.
Mr. Sherman said, he ha 1 no obje<stion to mak- ]
ing Philadelphia thetempofary refidenee, as fuon
as it was convenient.âHe jhen mentioned sever
al particulars which would l eader it inconvenient
to go there at present.
Mr. Huntington said, thit the only reason for
removing, which lie had eÂ«er heard, is, that this
place is not so central. If there is any force in
the reasoning, he wilhed not to Â»o to a place less
central. He adverted to&e mode of conveyance
ro this placc, generally adopted by members to
g*et to the feat of government. He supposed that
ihe prefeut centre was so â.e where between Phi
ladelphia and Baltimoie trut tlieplace contem
plated is very much removed from the centre,
more than miles Weft. With refpeft tocen-
trality, he said that it is not an idea which pre
dominates iu regard to any other country, of
which lie knew any thing refpecfting the geogra
phy âother and various important considerations
operated in fixing the feat of government.
Mr. White observed, that if this house was
alone to be consulted, 011 the principle of accom
modation, Baltimore might answerâbut when it
is considered that this bill originated in the other
house, who have an equal voice with usin deter
mining the quellionâand in which this place has
been repeatedly rejected, it is evident, that if the
clause is struck out, the bill will be loft. He then
controverted the calculations of the gentleman
lalt fpeakinjr, and stated the difference of travel
between the Southern and Northern difhinces,
which he made to be 4$ 10 1 ; but he said that so
far as rcfpected himfelf, he fliould make no dif
ficulty on that account ; but the accommodation
of the Citizens who may have bufinefsat the feat
of Government is a consideration of very great
importance âwith refpeit to the excentric situa
tion of the feat of Government in other countries';
this arose from themere whims df the sovereigns
ot tliofe Kingdoms ; but modern policy has obli
ged the people of European countries, (I refer
particularly to Great Britain) to fix the fear of
Tovernment, near the centre of tradeâit is the
commercial importance of the city of London,
which makes it the feat of government âand what
is the consequence ? Loudon and Westminster,
though they united fend only 6 members to parlia
ment, have a greater influence on the measures
of government, than the whole empire besides.
This is a situation >11 which we do not wifli ever
to fee this country placed. He concluded by
observing, that if this amendment is agreed to,
the bill will be loft, and we fliall be without ei
ther a temporary or permanent reftdence.
Mr. Lee, after a few introductory observations
entered into a consideration of the relative in
terells of the southern, middle and northern
States. He interspersed a variety of reflections,
tending to conciliate and blend those different
inrereits and to dillcininaie the sentiments of
union and concord. He alluded particularly to
the great objetft of funding the debts of the Uni
ted States âthe feat ot government will concen
trate the public paperâhence he inferred the
neceflity of a situation from whence all parts of
the Union, may be equally benefittedâFrom these
confideratipns he deduced the neceflity of placing
521
the government in a central fitua'rion. He ob
served that vvlnle the present poliiiou continued
to be the feat or government, the agriculiure of
the States to the eastward is invigorated and en
couraged, while that tothe Southward is Linguifli
ing and expiring. He then ihewed the f;ifal ten
dency of this preponderating encouragement to
tliofe parts of the country, already considered as
the ftrongell parts of the Unionâand from the
natural operation of these principles, heinfen ed,
that the interefl of the Southern States niuftbo '
eventually swallowed up. The deeifion of ihe
Senate, said he, affords a most favorable oppor
tunity to tnanifeft that niagnanifnity of foul*
which lhall embrace, upon nn extenlive liberal
system, the belt interefl of the great whole.â
This cannot be done- while the present unequal
situation of the feat of the government of the U -
nited States, continues.âNations have their pas
sions as well as individuals. He drew aii alarm
ing picture of the confeq renews to be apprehen
did from difilnion, anlbition and rival (hi p.âlie
then gave a pleasing Iketth of the happy effeifts
to be derived from a national, generous, and e
qual attention tothe southern a.id northern in
terests. Will gentlemen said he blnft this prof
peift by rejecting the bill ? I trust they will Â»or.
He then entered into the merits of the ques
tion.â The States of Delaware, Philadelphia,
Maryland and Virginia, which contribute more
than one half to the revenue, and which have
the only rival claim to the permanent feat of gtj
[ vernment are fatisfied with the arrangement in
the bill : That Philadelphia faitlhe, is thenearefl
centre of the present wealth and population of the
United States, thegentlemen ofNew-York them
selves will confefs ; the Potowniac will become
the nearcft centre for a permanent refidencepro â¢
bably by the period proposedâto oppose this
therefore will be ailing from merely local mo-
,ives.
The gentleman moves to insert Baltimore-
Mr. Lee in lilted that Baltimore is as far Touth as
the place proposedâbesides being exposed by
its frontier polition on the lea ; we are not con
fined said he to a particular spot on the Potow
inac ; we may fix 011 a place as far north as the
gentleman from Connecticut wiflies ; 1 consider
the motion therefore calculated to destroy the
bill, and ought to be opposed by every one who
is in favor of a Southern situation.
This State has 110 pretentions to the perma
nent residenceâit is true the citizens of this
place have put themselves to great expence to
accommodate the government, and are entitled to
much praise for their exertionsâbut he wilhed
to take up the subject on national ground, and
to have it decided on principles which apply to
the best interests of the whole. He then refer
red to a map of the Potowmac and the adjacent
country which lay 011 the table, and Which had
been sent from the executive of the State of Vir
giniaâhe referred also to other papers and do
cuments.
Mr. Burke said he wished that the whole buii-
tiefs of the temporary and permanent residence
might now be fettled.âHe exculpated the mem
bers, who are in favor of Baltimore from all de
sign to defeat the present bill. He referred to
some observations which had been made on the
conduct; of the members of the States, south of
Virginia, and said that they had consulted
interest of the v/hole. One reason why he was
in favor of the motion was because he preferred
Baltimore to Conocogeque. He a popu
lous city better than building a palace in the
woods. Another reason was that there was 110 po
litical neceflity existed for removing the Govern
ment from New York to Philadelphia. He said
thattlie measure would excite the most turbulent
paflions in the minds of the citizens. It is unjust
to the people of the city to remove from this
place said he, till the expenccthey have incurred
is repaid thein. It is a breach of honesty and of
justice. It is injustice to the state ! Tothewhole
nation. He entered into a consideration of their
facrifices and services. He thought it a very ex
traordinary measure indeed. It is calculated
said he to arrest the funding fyilemâand to
throw every thing into confufioit. If the bill is
passed in its present torm, Congress will never
leave Philadelphia ; for the coinmillioners to be
appointed will incur no penalty for a neglect of
doing their dutyâthis is a most efiential defect,
said he, 111 the bill, and there are other defects
in it. He spoke in handsome terms of the Star j
of Pennfvlvaniaâhe said lie ha*l as high an xt "...
[Whoie No. 131.3nioii of that State, as any man whatever, but he
was afraid of their influence ; and thatftate was
the last in which he would ever consent the per.
nianent feat of 'government should be. He then
adverted to the influence of the members from
that State, who by their political management
had, he said, raised a-ftorrnt in the United States.
Here Mr. Burke was called to orderâafter a
short interruption he proceeded, and said a quak
er Hate was a bad neighbourhood for the South-
Caroliniansâhere he adverted to the quaker bu
iinefs lall winter. He obje&ed to Philadelphia
also, oh account <rf there being no gallery in the
house proposed for the accommodation of Con
gressâan open gallery he considered as a very
important check to the Legifllature.
Mr. Lawrance.âThe gentleman from Virginia
has observed that the object of the amcndmentis
to defeat the billâhe has also mentioned the
States which are most particularly interested in
the queltion. Mr. Lawrance laid the State of
!New-York might have been considered. He wiilied
the motion might succeed, because he thought
that it would conduce to the peace of the Union.
He obje&ed to the place proposed for the perma
nent residence ; by the bill it is conceded that the
place is not, at present, a suitable positionâby
what magic can it be made to appear it will be
more proper at the end of ten years !âWhat
reason can be given why those parts of the Uni
on should not populate, which are at a diltance
from the Potowmac, in proportion to those parts
in the vicinity of that place. I presume none
can be afligned ! Why then is a period of ten
years to elope, previous to going there ? The
reason is plainâthe people would not nowconfent
to have the government dragged to so remote a
part of the United StatesâHe then adverted to
the funding business, and other important mat
ters which remain to be decided on, and very
strongly intimated that these quertions were to
be determined ag eeable to the fate of this bill.
He fbewetl from a vaHety of particulars,
that Philadelphia would become the permanent
residence.
He then adverted particularly to the several
parts of the bill.â The firft was refpeifting the
place where it is proposed to eredt the public
buildings ; he laid they could not be erected
tvithin the time mentioned, and lhewed the vari
ous difficulties which would attend the whole
buiinefs. He then Hated the advantages of Bal
tiinore, and faidthat that place would have ob
tained in Senate, if the Maryland Senators would
have voted for it. He concluded by observing,
that as no neceflity exilts for removing the tern
pnrary residence, lie hoped that Cong.efs would
fct down contented where they are.
Mr. Bloodworth observed, that as the fuuding
bill, had been alluded to, he could wilh that the
objection from that quarter might be taken ou;
of the way, he moved that the committee (hould
rife, in order to take up the Ways and Means.
Mr. Smith, (M.) introduced an address from
the inhabitants of Baltimore, to the Members and
Senators from that State, which Was read. This
contained an account of the number of houses
and inhabitants of that town, &c. alio, the ac
commodations already made, and the provision to
be made tocompleat every wecefl'aiy arrangement.
Mr. Carroll mentioned to the commitiee that
there was a memorial of the inhabitants of
George-Town, on Potowmac.on the tableâwhicli
he had presented some days since , and fubmirted
it to the lioufe whether it would be proper to
read it.âlt was read.
Mr. Lee uioved that certain papers received
from the executive of Virginia, should be read
â which was done.
Mr. Smith, (S. C.) called for the reading of a
report of a committee appointed by the old Con
gress, to view the banks of the Potowmacâwhich
was done.
Mr. Stone.âAll we feemto differ about,is whe
ther Baltimore or Potowmac /ball be the feat of the
government; and if this was all, the delegates ot
that State might fold their arms and set down
contentedâbut the flare of Maryland has been
placed in the situation of Tantalus. He then lta
terl how the gentleman had formerly, finally vo
ted, who now appear in favor of Baltimoreâhad
the bill comedown from the Senate with Balti
more inserted, inltead of Potowmac, he should
have had no difficulty in determining how toadi
.âbut he conceived that if the amendment now
proposed should take place, nothing would be
doneâand the business will be left in a very in
auspicious ftateâfrom this and other considera
tions, he was resolved not to be drawn off from
his present dete'mmation,by any motion, amend
ment, or modification of the bill whatever.
With refpedl to liimfelf, he had no election be
tween the town of Baltimore and the Potowmac ;
yet is a Marylander, he would, if he saw a prof
| cR of success, vote for the town of Baltimore ;
hut as it refpe<fied the United States, he should
- ote for potowmacâand on this idea he was wil
Jing to make some facrifices. He considered the
fcihje<st as one of the mofl painful and difagreea-
We that could be agitated, and he wiflied to have
r .hc business finally and unalterably fixecl.
Mr. Seney also considered this as an unhappy
question to come before the hoUfc at this time.
The ttate of Maryland was as much divided ou
the fubjeiftas the United State# appeared to be ; a
great rivalfliip fublifts between the Potowmac
and Sufquehannah rivers ; and he doubted not
but"thit vfrlien tlifc qutftion was ultimately deci-"
ded, it would be either on the one or the other
of those rivers. He agreed with Mr. Lee, that
Pennsylvania, Maryland and Virginia were the
only states who could'make any reasonable pre
tentions to be the l'eat of governmentâbut a ma
jority of voices from these States had been agjainft
the Potowmac. Pennfylvaaia and Maryland he
observed, had given the preference to the Sufque
hannah. Mr. Seney-then noticed some tranlac
tions of the legiilature of Maryland, Which he
said clearly evinced their detexmination to sup
port the pretentions of the Sufquehannah. Mary
land certainly had an equal right with Pennsyl
vania and Virginia,to have her interests consulted.
The interests of Maryland, it appeared,
now to be facrificed tÂ® those two adjoining States.
And howeveiflau&iiiigit may seem, to Maryland,
to fix the feat of rnrfient on her fide of the
Pstowinac, the ;-eal advantages were in a great
measure nugatory, as it would be but a very small
portion of that State that could reap any benefit
therefromâthe real advantages would undoubt
enly result to Pennlylvania and Virginia.â It ap
peared somewhat extraordinary lohim, that gen
tlemen should be willing to confine the residence
to a particular fptot, previous to their removing
to a permanent residence. Why is it neceflary
to fix upon Philadelphia for ten years ?âSurely
this is putting the government in a very ineligi
ble tituation, for it is by no means improbable
that many ferisus and important occurrences
might render a removal highly expedient perhaps
unavoidable. Betides, after the government
shall have' remained ten years in Philadelphia,
the probability of quirting it for the Potowmac,
appeared to be very flight indeed. For though
it was tinderftood by the bill that the offices were
to be removed tothe Potowmac, yet if a majority
in either houl'e were opposed to going there,
Congress would remain at Philadelphia, and they
would be obliged to repeal the bill from necel"-
fiiy.
Mr. Scot faidhefhould not notice many things
which hail been offered on the fubje<ft,he would on
ly obferve,that from the town ofÃaltimore there is
110 water conveyance to the interior country
âbut from the proposed place on the Potowmac,
there are 200 miles navigation directly into the
heart of the countryâNor is Baltimore more
northerly than the jjofition contemplated.âA
connection with the Weft ern country is of the
tumult ccnfequence to the peace and union of
the United States, let the gentlemen from thefea
coast fay what they will.
Mr. Madison : (n order to decide this question
rightly, we ought to compare the advantages and
disadvantages of the two places as they relate to
the good of the United States. Now,l will defy
any gentleman, however sanguine lis may be
with refpedi to Baltimore, to point out any fub
ftaiuial advantage that is not common to the Po
towmacâand 1-defythem to disprove, that there
are not several important advantages belonging
to tlie PoLowmac, which do not appertain to
Baltimore. The committee have had ample in
formation with refpeift to the northern and south
ern portions of the two places. Inpoint offalu
brity of air, without dilparagmg the pretensions
of Baltimore, the Potowmac is at least equally fa
vored in that refpeOt. In regard to centrality of
si. uation, I'otowmac has undoubtedly the advan
tageâin refpe(fl to security from invasion, I aver
the Potowmac has the advantage alsoâwith rela
tion co the western country there is not a shadow
of coinparifon. If we should go as far South as
Baltimore, why not an equal diltancc south weft
to the Potowmac ?âThofe who are acquainted
; with the country on the Potowmac, and that in
the neighborhood of Baltimore, do not heinate
to give the preference to the Potowmac It is
true that Baltimore has refpertable resourcesâ
her rapid growth is a dear proof of itâbut look
at the resources of the Fptowmacâthe great range
of rich country that bonders on it, and fee if there
are not advantages thatmuft in a short time pro
duce a commercial town. Sir, a period might be
named, not exceeding ten years, within which
the town of Baltimore obtained the greater part
ot ttsmcreafe and consequence ; a period of ten
years w,ill produce the fame effects on the Potow
mac because the fame causes exilt ; and when
l\-peradded to this the residence of government
<hall be there, there can be no doubt but that
desired eery accommodation that can be
It is laid that before the ten years expire a re
peal of the may take place, and thus Congreis
be kept at Ph.ladelphia. But what more can we
do than pass a law for the pnrpofe ? It i s n o f i,i
our power to guard agajnft a repeal-oar a<fts are
not like those of the, Aledcs and Persians unal

If cliufe states that may have a fupeiiority JnC
grefs at a future day, will pay no 'refpeet to th*

there 'is 110 power to compel them. Â° '
But, I flatter inyfelf that some will 1 m

greater than that by water. He Hated the ad
vantages that the southern members derived from

is there, said he, any thing to balance the rifle and
difficulties which the northern members must en

was highly unreasonable to fix the feat of

i he wi' Jnm ot nations has remarked the univcrlal conlidcraiion
pjid t â  wealth ; anil that the paflionof avarice, excited by it. pro
duced treachery, cowardice, and a felfifl, unsocial meanness, but
had no tendency to produce those virtues of patience, courage
fortitude, honor, or patriotism, which the I'ervice of the pub. ic re
quired in iheir cit lent, in peace and war.
The wifdoiti ot nations has observed, that the general attention
paid to bnth, produced a diffeicnt kind of sentiments ; those ot a
pride in the maxims and principles in religion, morals and go
vernment, as well as in ihe talents and virtues which firft produ
ced illuftrarion to ancestors.
As the pride of wealth produced nothing but meanness of fen
tim. Nt, and a fordid scramble for monev ; and the pride of birth
produced forne degree of emulation in knowledge and virtue
tie wisdom of nations has endea ored to employ one prejudice

The National Aflcmblv of F, ance is too enlightened a body to

P A R*l S, April 16
This city has not experienced a more violent
agitation lince the revolution, than it has done
for the lalt three or four days Religious mo
tives have been one alligned reason toi the tu
multsâbut the more jult cause has been, a con
federacy among the members ot the clei and
lame others, to overturn the decrees ot the Na
tional Aff'embly of the second of November Kilt,
alienating the lands of the clergy to pay oft the
debis of the nation.
On the 13th at night, the police having re
ceived information that a very numerous meet
ing was fecrerly held at the Capuchin Convent,
which was rather suspicious, a guard was instant
ly dispatched thither, where, among others,
were found, the archbifhopof Toulou r e, thebifh
op of Nanci, the Abbe Mauri, Mefl'. d'Efpreme
nil, Cazalet, and about two hundred more mem
bers of the National Aficinbly. Several refolu
tious have been palled among them, That in calc
the decree for alienating the Church Lands from
their ancient poflefTors was finally carried into ex
ecution, they would set the kingdom into con
fufion by the writings that should be dispersed a
broad. Several other long resolutions palled
which are not yet public.
On the 14th iufl.fcveral ofthefe members went to
the Aflembly with firearms concealed under their
clothes. The clergy had, on the preceding day,
got over about one hundred and seventy-one
members 10 their views, and they entertained the
ftrongefl hope, that what with this acquisition of
numbers, with threats, declamation and clamour,
they would be able to carry their paint. At no
fitting since the revolution, has there been a bat
tle so hardly contested, or conducted with such
intrepidity. All the higher and many of the in
ferior clergy, jumped into the trenches to defend
the bastions and ramparts of the church, but in
vainâafter four days struggle, they were con
quered by a great majority as will appear by the
succeeding account of the final determination of
the aflembly, by which the nation is irrevocably
confirmed in its right to the eccleiiaftical lands.
Previous to this question being introduced to
the aflembly, the cjergy had bceii extremely as
siduous in circulating incendiary letters through
out their dioceses.
Tlie agitation which their meeting at the Ca
puchin Convent, and the alarm which the violent
debates in the National Allembly had produced,
had caused the marquis de la Fayette and M. Bail
ly to place a treble guard about the Thuillerics,
to refill: the mob. A member complained of this
in the debate, but ir proved extremely fortunate,
for several members would ctherwife have been
faci ificed in getting away. As it was, fevefal
were very roughly handled.
A large concourfeof people had adembled ear
ly on the i 4th, at the avenues of the National
Allembly to hear the debate. On the members
coming away, some were applauded, others were
hootedâThe Vifcountde Mirabeau being hilled,
he drew his sword, which lb incensed the mob,
that he would have been murdered, had it not
been for the affillance of the guards, who con
ducted him and M. Cazalct to the Jacobite con
vent, where climbing over the walls they escaped.
The Abbe Mauri got off undiscovered from the
allembly ; but being met in the evening, the
mob allailed him, when he drew a pair of pistols
from under his coat, but feeing himfelf in dan
ger of being overpowered, he ran into a house
and rtiutthe door. Ihe guard soon came to his
aflillance. M. de Noailles, though a great ene
my to the Abbe's politics, living near to the place
flew to his rescue. M. Mounter did the lame,
and both joined in offering him their hotel for
his protection, which he accepted of.
The King, though a friend to the Abbe Mauri,
has thought it prudent to desire that neither he
nor the \ ifcount de Mirabeau may viiic him at
the Thuillerics, as his majesty is fearful of some
popular disturbance.
