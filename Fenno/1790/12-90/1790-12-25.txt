" The commerce of this country is so difuf,d and
t!r?ided with other obj.' cis r /J attention, that id?
tfcape those vices which prevail among a people puri
ly commercial.'"
'"INHERE is hardly a circumltance more favor
able to the real fafety and prosperity of the
United States, than the difliculry any particular
class of citizens mull' find in gaining influence or
wealth to the exclusion of other clafles. Men
employed in commerce and speculation will al
ways command inoft of the active property, in
any country where commerce and enterprize are
encouraged and rei'pe<fted. But in this country,
the leading men are and will be composed of
Inch a blend of characters that the mercantile in
terest can never maintain more than a proper
lhare of weight in the public deliberations. All
profeffions and descriptions of people will be so
far noticed that their voice will be neither un
heard or difi egarded. This blend of chara<fier
prevents the inhabitants of this country from
wearing tliofe marks of nationality which corn
ftitute a flrong, decided national character, It
likewise affords a security againlt the intrigues
of powerful combinations, as well as againlt the
cffecfls of rapid and enormous wealth. There
seems to be no denomination of men who can
combine so much strength as to defeat rhofe
mcafures which may be dictated by the general
fentir.ients of the community.
I have made the preceding remarks to coun
teract the force of an objection that is fometjmes
raised againfl giving encouragement to men en
gaged in commercial pursuits : It is often fug
gelted that the wealth such men will acquire
mull give them a di(proportionate share of in
fluence in the operations of the government,
and introduce maxims and manners, hostile to
public liberty. As tlipfp pointÂ© been, ill
fonie meaftire, contemplaied in three or four of
iriy late speculations, I proceed to place thefub
jetftin a new and different light. There is no
reason to apprehend that commerce will again
produce such rapid or extensive wealth to indi
vidual men, or to trading cities, as have been
experienced in former times
Too many nations are now acquainted and
concerned with comme: ce to l ender the gains of
any particular community Hidden or enormous.
11l England and Holland, it is true, there is a
vast fnperiority over other nations not less in
clined to purine, and not worse fnuated to at
tain commercial advantages. But the immense
tradingflocks acquired in those countries beiore
their neighbors had conceived a spirit of enter
prize has prevented the objects of commerce
from flowing in their molt natural channels.
This inequality however will fljortly be correct
ed, and probably 110 fucli difproporiion will
ajrain prevail. The fame observation may in
foine degree be applied to individuals. she
diltribution of commerce will throw it into so
many hands qs to create such a competition as
will'not only lellen the prolit of bulinefs, but di
vide it among such a number of persons that few
ornone can reap immoderate gains.
When the trade of the world was confined to
a few narrow diftrids, some enterprizing com
munities acquired riches so rapidly as to fall into
the extremes either of avarice or prodigality.
Tliou'gli habits of accumulating wealth general
ly make men avaricious, yet sudden gains some
times have a contrary effect. However, in either
of these cases, the consequence of such riches has
a pernicious aKpe.fi upon society. For a commu
nity that is prodigal or covetous, will alike.dif
regard those institutions which are bed calculat
ed to promote science, virtue and freedom. Si
tuated as we are in tlve United States, we (hall
derive mod of the benefits of commerce, without
being exposed to many of its inconveniencies. It
is not probable the inhabitants of this country
â vvlll ever bedebafed by that servile avarice which
characterizes a people purely commercial; nor,
on the other hand, will apy particular trading
town gain a pre-eminence over others as to
fall'into tha,t.prodigality wliic[i results from fa
t pid aCquisitions of property. Our merchants in
termingle so much with other ilafles of citizens,
that they are ambitious of other diftindiions be

By ihel'e means they wear off the sharp points of
their profellional vices, and become a generous

ous part of tlie coiumunity. The commercial,
agricultural and manufacturing interests are
blejuled in focli a manner, in this country, that
they matt rife and fall together. No branch of
them can be injured by the prosperity of the
others. All j'ealoufies therefore between them
are premature and ill-grounded. Should the
ft)bject be once more relumed, it will bring into
a summary view tlie leading ideas contained in
several of my lad fpectilations.

CONGRESS.
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
Sketch of the Debatej on lh; MILITIA BILL.
MONDAY, Dec. 20, 1790.
The 3d feiftion under con fide rat ion.
MR. FITZSIMONSYnoved an amendment, by
which the light infantry, or riflelti'eii, one
company of artillery, and one troop of liorfe,
should be feletfted from the militia, without refer
ence to any particular age. He fakl the clause
which enacfts that tliefe companies /hall be com
posed of persons from 18 to 2j years of age, would
operate again (I several particular interests, espe
cially mechanicks and manufacturers.
Mr. Madi("on remarked that by the bill, all per
sons between the ages of iÃand 2J, were to serve
in tliofe companiesâit was not confined to artifi
cers alone. The agricultural interell had as much
caofe to complain. But the intension, of making
the youth perforin double duty, was that they
might speedily be taught the military art, and be
enabled to defend their country, if her Situation
called for their aid
Mr. Jackson was opposed to it : He said tliat
from 18 to 21 was found to be the belt age to
make soldiers of. After that period men become
engaged in the concerns of lifeâget married,
have children, enter into bufmefs, &c. It would
not bear harder on the manufacturers and me
cliankks than on the farmersâand as the sea
ports have generally more at Hake, it seems to
tollo\vthat the obligation is llronger on them to
turn out in the militia.
Mr. Heifter was in favor of the motion.
Mr. Fitzfiinons said he was tnifunderftood : He
did not mean that persons from 18 to 25 ftiotild.
be excufedfrom military duty : His wish was that
facli persons should not be particularly pointed
out for this duty.
Mr. Lawranct was in favor of the motion : He
obfervt'd that it was not age alone that was to be
considered in forming light infantry or artillery
companies : There are other considerations, as
size, agility, Szc. He thought the motion a good
one.Mr. Ames was also in favor of the motion : He
thought confining the felccfiions for those com
panies to the particular period mentioned, would
deprive us of the fervicesof many of the soldiers
of the late continental army, whose knowledge
and experience would be highly ufeful. He I'ug
gefted difficulties which would result from col
lecting the persons of the above age, from differ
ent parts of the country, in order to forming
them into futh companies.
Mr. Sturges observed, that he thought afiinple
regulation, that all the militia ffiould be called out
so many times a year would be fufficient : This
general plan would leave thefeveral independent
corps as they now areâand these particular com
panies would be fele<fted as heretofore.
Mr. Partridge was opposed to the amendment.
The object of the bill being to dilcipline the mi
litia, it feeined to follow of course, that persons of
an age, the moll likely to learn, should not be ex
cepted.
Mr. Giles said, that gentlemen did not appear
to take -a comprehensive view of the bill : One
objedt of which is to establish a military school.
In order to this the bill .proposes that persons
should commence their military course at an ear-
Jy age. Iffuch persons are called upon oftener
than those of more than 25 years, it does not fol
low that it is unequalâtheir military knowlege
must befuppofedto be leis. He obviated the ob
jection of the gentleman from New-York, by fay
ing that as military knowledge is neceflary for
all, it follows, tliat young persons of every size
may be trained in one or other of these companies.
Mr. Fitzfimons still fupporred his motion, and
said the difficulty started by the gentleman from
Maflachufetts [Mr. Ames] arising from local cir
cumstances, had not been obviated
Mr. Boudinot said the difficulty, on account of
manufacturers, had not escaped the committee ;
but it could not be avoided without defti oying a
principal feature of the bill. He said the objec
tion might however be in fomemeafure leflened,
by altering the clause from 18 to 20.
The question being taken, it pafled in the af
firmative.
Mr. Smith's (S. C.) proviso, respecting inde
pendent corps, was read : It provided that com
panies in the refpetftive States, incorporated by
the Legislatures, should not be disbanded or in
cluded in the militia, but retain their former
station.
Mr. Giles said he was disposed to think this
proviso more extensive than gentlemen imagine:
It may in its operation exempt all the companies
in the United States. The expression is so gene
ral, and indefinite, that it may not answer the
pnrpofe intended, as those companies are,known
by different denominationsâwhile it may be pro
du&ive of great difficulties from its want of pre
cision.
Mr Amci an account of the several inde
pendent companies in Maflachufetts, particularly
that known by the name of the Ancient and Ho
nourable Artilleryâa company which poflefled
funds, and had for many years been in pofleffion
of a charter from government: It had been con
sidered as a military fcliool for a long timeâit is
conipofed of Generals, Colonels, and inferior of
ficers, and other refpetfiable persons. This, with
other independent companies, rendered essential
services in the time of the infurredlion in that
state ; and they prove, by their example, a ftiinu
lous to the militiaâthey have incurred great ex
penses to equip themselves, and it is supposed
merit the privileges and diftinÂ«Ttions they have
long enjoyed.
Mr. Sturges observed that the proviso was de
fective, as it does not point out the duties which
these companies ought to perform.
Mr. Huntington said these companies were, he
believed, under the orders of the regimental
colonels ; at least that was the cafe in fonie of the
States.
Mr. Seney moved, that as there were indepen
dent companies who are not incorporated, it
would be proper to ftnke out the words incorpo
rated by the alls of the federal States. He said, if
this proviso fiiould pass without his amendment,
it would give exclusive privileges to particular
companies who happen to be incorporated
â¢while the fame privileges will not be extended
to other companies, equally meritorious, who do
not happen to be incorporated.
Mr. Smith's (S. C.) motion being put, was ne
gatived.
The leÂ«fiion which provides that the militia
shall turn out four times a year in companies,
Mr. Hartley objected to. He said it would be
too frequent. He did not consider the militia as
a military schoolâand such frequent aflemblings
of the people had a tendency to diflipate the
manners of the people, especially youth. He
moved that the claufc should be altered, so that
companies and battalions ftould be Â»bliged to
turn out only twice a year.
Mr. Wadfworth suggested an alteration in the
amendment, that the clauf'e fliould be altered to
read once a year in battalion, and four times in
companies
Mr. Oilman moved another amendment, that
the militia should turn out in companies three
timei, and once in battalion.
Mr. Jackson regretted that one principle of
the bill was struck out, refpecfting light-infantry
companies. He did not suppose (that though we
are obliged to have some ltanding troops) we
were to depend upon them. - He should regret
the time when this country would depend on a
standing army. He enlarged on the importance
of disciplining the militia : This, said he, is con
fident with the ftridteft principles of republican
ism. He believed.the preservation of liberty
very much depended oil a good militia:. He
thought four- times a year would not be too bur
thenfome, and he was pretty sure it was little
enough to answer any eflential purpose.
Mr. Sherman was in favour of four times in
companies at least, and in battalion as might be
found convenient.
Mr. Wadfworth observed, that less than four
times would answer no purpose at all. Indeed,
it is said, nothing is to be expeifted ; if that is
the cafe, let us give up all thoughts of a militia
billâbut what then becomes of your national
defence ?
Mr. Hartley's motion was loft
Mr. Sherman moved that the clause be amend
ed, to read, that regiments turn out once a yearâ
Carried.
On motion of Mr. Wadfworth, the times of
rendezvoufingin regiments and companies is to be
regulated by the officer commanding the brigade.
The clause which provides for a Commissary of
Military Stores for each State, Mr. Parker moved
should be struck out. He said the several States
are competent to taking care of their own mili
tary property. This motion was agreed to.
Mr. Wadfworth moved that the Adjutant Gen.
fhoukl have the rank of Brigadier, instead of
Lieut. Col. as proposed by the bill.
Mr. Sherman observed, that according to the
last regulations of the army, no ftafF officer was
to have any rank.
Mr. Wadfworth replied, that the regulation
which the gentleman had mentioned, refpeifted
ftaff officers only who never have any command
âbut an officer of such importance as the Adju
tant General, on whom so much depended, and
who might be inverted with a very important
command, he conceived ought to rank higher
than a Lieut. Col. This motion was adopted.
Adjourned.
TUESDAY, Dec. 21.
Militia Bill flill under confideralion.
The 9th, 10th and 11 feiftions were read.
Mr. Bloodworth said, that in his opinion the
house had entered too much into minutiae of
the business, and in a great measure were about
depriving the Itates of the power granted to
them by the constitution. The general govern
ment ought only to organize the militia, and di
reift the mode of difciplipe. The militia, he ob
served, was only under the direction of the gene
ral government when called out in the acftual ser
vice of the United States ; the different states
had the appointment of officers and the right of
trainingthem : but owing to themany particulars
attended to in the bill, he could fee but little
room left to the dates for the exercise of their
power. He thought that endeavouring to establish
a perfedt uniformity in fines, would render that
part of the system very defective ; as the fame
fine might bejuftly complained of as heavy in
one part of the country, and at the fame time be
conlidered so trifling in another part as to ren
der it ineffectual ; he therefore wished that this
part of the business be left to the states to per
form. He moved for ttriking out a number of
clauses, containing several of the particulars he
objected to, not carried.
The 12th, 13th and 14th fecftions were read.
The two firft pafled without alteration ; the
third was ftruckout.
Mr. Madison said, he conceived it would be ne
ceflary to pass a law, authorising the President of
the United States to call out the militia, as the
constitution only fays, that he {hall be comman
der in chief of the militia when in the ferrice of
tW? United States, without giving him the pow
er of ordering it out.
Mr. Fitzfimons wiihed a clause inserted in the
bill, granting the President that power.
Mr. Boudinot conceived it was not the inten
tion of theconftitution thathe (hould bepoflefled
of such a power. It could only be granted to
him by afpecial acft of Congress.
Mr. Smith read a law palled last feflion, and
still in force, giving him that authority.
The t 6th fecftion (providing penalties for those
not performing n.ilitia duty, and pointing out
exemptions) being read,
Mr. Sherman moved to have it struck out. It
was, he said, an absolute poll tax, and not levied
according to the number of inhabitants, which
was in violation of theconftitution.
Mr. Burke said it was contrary to the interest
of the militia to eftabliih so many exemptions as
had been provided. He gave notice, that when
the report came before the house, he would move
for their reduction, and give his reasons fully.
682
It was contrary to the confutation, he also ob
served/ to lay a tax upon certain clafles of citi
zens ; it was not consonant with the principles'
ofjuftice to makethofe conscientiously scrupulous
of bearing arms pay for not a<fting against the
voice of their conscience. This, he'Jl'aid, was
called the land of liberty, in it, we boasted, that
no one fuffered on account of bis conscientious
scruplesâand yet we are going to make a respec
table class ofcitizens pay for a right to a free ex
ercise of their religious principles : It was con
trary to the confticutionâit was contrary to that
found policy which ought to diretfl the house in
establishing the militia.
Mr. Jackson said he certainly fliould oppose
the principle started by the gentleman lalt up.
Who was to know, he asked, what persons were
really conscientiously scrupulous There was no
tribunal erected to make them swear to their
scruples. If the principle was adopted, lie con
ceived, very few would be found, if their own
word was to be taken, not conscientiously scrupu
lous. There are, he said, other fetfts, befidesthe
society of Quakers, averse to bearing arms. If
the principle was adopted of requiring no c'om
penfation from the exempted, it was laying the
axe to the root ofthe milkifi, and, in his opinion,
the bill might as well be postponed altogether.
He did not chufe to enter into the fubjetfl fully
at this time : He would wait until the bill cnme
before the house.
The 17th fecftion (providing infpedlors of the
militia) was read.
Mr. Seney said, Maryland he thought should
have two infpecftors, itiftead of one, as provided
by the fe<stion : That state, heobferved, was divi
ded by a wide and sometimes dangerous bay,
which could not at all times be eroded. Two
infpetftors were agreed to for Maryland, one
to reside on the eastern, the other on the western
shore.
Mr. Lawrance fawan impropriety in providing
the fame allowance for all the infpedors,without
regard to the quantum of duty to be performed.
The duty, he observed, of an infpecitor in the
State of Rhode-lfland, could not be near so great
as that of the infpecftor in the State of New- York.
He moved that their different salaries be fixed
and fpecified in the bill.
It was agreed ; and the blanks lefcto be filled
with such sums as shall be deemed proper, kvhen
the honfe (hall take that part of the bill into con
flderation.
Mr. Sherman was of opinion that some of the
duties, by this fetflion to devolve on infpejftors,
to be left te the States to exercise. Their
duty should be confined to fuperintenrling the
excrrife and nictnocuvrec.
Mr. Bloodworth was averse to appointing an
officer to be directed by state laws. He ftiould
be appointed, said he, by the state.
Mr. Wadfworth said, in his opinion, he ought
to be a continental officer, and conduct himfblf
in his office in conformity to the laws pafled by
the States.
Mr. Smith moved that that clause which leaves
the appointment of this officer to the president
be struck out, and that it only be fpecified that
such an officer shall be appointed.
Mr. Boudinotconfidered this officer as appoint
ed to affilt the President : It was necessary that
the commander in chief should be acquainted
with the state of the militia, tliroiigli-rit ti'.i con
tinent; it was impoflible for him to gather this
information without aliiltance, the officer was ap
pointed for that purpose, he should be consider
ed as a continental officer, and as such was to be
paid by the general government.
Mr. Smith (aid, if his motion prevailed of ha
ving this officer appointed by thejftates he would

Mr. Lawrance wiflied thp clause {truck outj
and the power of the dury of infpeÂ«slor left to the
adjudantggeneral .â¢ In New-York this is the cafe.
Mr. Boudinot fa>d, he thought the duty too
great, and the {alary such an officer would require
more than the states would consent to give, the
officer would not be appointed, and the President
could not receive the neceflary information. The
infpertor was not a militia officer ; but appointed
to collect the information the President {hould
want, for the benefit of the union.
Mr. Fitzfimons gave it as his opinion, that the
officer fliould be under the appointment of the
President.
Mr. Sherman said, there appeared to be a diÂ£
trufl of this infpetfior, unless appointed by the
President ; he thought there could be no just
foundation for entertaining this opinion, if he
should be appointed by the slates. He was cer
tainly appointed for the good of the union ; but
if the leveral states did pay his salary, the expence
would in the end devolve on the United Stares.
It was agreed to leave the appointment to the
states.
Mr. Stone moved that the clause giving to in
fpeftors the rank of lieut. col. be struck Out. He
observed, thatfince the appointment of those of
ficers was left to the states, the house could not
with propriety fix the rank.Mr. Wadfworth hoped it would not be llruck
our. He obfierved, that as the house had the
power of .organizing the militia, and were about
determining that there should be infpeftors,
they could with the fame propriety fiiy what rank
those infpecSors should hold. He was as much a-
Yerfe as any man to granting unneceU'ary titles ;
but where great trust was reposed, and severe du
ty required, there rank {hould also follow. These
inspectors were placed in a very important stati
on, which they could not properly fill without
the weight of i'ome military rank.
Mr. Stone withdrew liis motion.
Mr. Blood worth moved that the rank of brig
adier fiiould be given to them, agreed.
Mr. Benfon moved for an additional clause to
the bill, for granting to the President of the
United States, the power of calling out the mili
tia into the service of the United States, &c. to
repel invaflons or suppress infurretftions.
Mr.Sherman obfervedthat the proposed clause
â was not explicit enough. The general govern
ment by the constitution had not the power of
calling out the militia to suppress infurre<ftions
in the ltatesj without the special request of the
states.
Mr. Bloodworth hoped the additional feclion
would not be adopted, it would be lie said, a
dangerous provision.
Mr. Benfon argeed to withdraw liis motion for
lie present, to bring it before the houte when
the principles of the bill came to be difcufled by
them.
The committee rofe,reported the bill with sun
dry amendments. The speaker resumed the
chair.
Mr. Fitzfimons propoled giving the bill with
the amendments to a special committee to report
thereon
Mr. Madison said it would be improper to re
fer it to a committee, without iirft agreeing to the
principles of the bill.
Mr. Livermore was also against leaving it to a
committee The principles of the bill were by
no means fettled. Three-fourths of it he looked
tipon as useless. The house he conceived, had
no business to enter minutely into particulars ot
the business, further than was warranted by the
constitution.
The report of the committee was ordered to

"We are anxiously waiting to fee the Presi
dent's Speech, and the opening and afpecft of the
present felfion of Congrefsâlf wifdoin guides
the helm, our national profpedis will be blight
and glorious ! far beyond common calculation.
1 think the ellablifhmenc of a national bank, un
der wife regulations, may be prodntflive of vast
benefits ; by taking the funded stock in the bank
forfecurity: The nation may pay the interest
of the debt, with the interelt received for the
loan of bank notes, so that in fact, the one may
so balance the other as to cost the nation nothing
to pay her interest: ; and nearly all her revenue
inay be applied to pay off the principle of her
debt. If this calculation be light, what an eligi
ble situation our public debt mult be in!
I have jaft glanced an eye over the address of the
Pennsylvania creditors, proposed for further
consideration, in order to petition Congress. I
am not ripe in opinion to form any conjectures
what effedt it may produce ; or what attention
ought to be paid to it. The funding system was
not formed agreeable to my ideas of juflice,
but it may be dangerous to alter it : It require*
much greater wisdom to mend a bad fyllem,
than to make a good one."
One great objeift of the Conflitntion in provi
ding for a national militia in the United States,
most undoubtedly was, to preserve some propor
tional equality in the strength of the several parts
of the Unionâbut except a supervising power
should be exercised by the general government,
it is evident that particular states may, and will
make such regulations in their militia, as will
create in those ltates the most attentive a force,
that may be paramount to that of their neigh
bours ; and an agreement of several states in
such apian ofdifcipline, would produce ajmilitary
power that would give law to the Uuion. This
power ex ifts in the refpedlive ftates,till it (hall be
aflumed by Congress agreeable to the con
stitution. Experience has proved, â¢ that left at
large in the hands of the several states, a rival
military spirit has been generated, which has
produced the greatest difp.irity between the mi-
litia of different statesâa division of the power
to regulate the militia, reduces the defence of
the United States to a nullityâWhat will be the
confequencefThe general government is left with

standing army ; so that the result is thisâWhether
the general governmentihall so arrange the mi-

sword as well as the purse, is but the ikeleton of
a government.
By the report of a committee of the Legifiature of Maryland on

TREASURY DEPARTMENT,")
Dccei?ib:r 13, 1790. J
In obedience to the Order of the House of Re-
prefentatives of the Ninth day ot Augult lait,
requiring the Secretary of the Treasury to pre
pare and report, on this day, such further pro
vision as may, in his opinion, be neceflary for
eftablilhingthepublic creditâthe faidSecretary
Reffed fully Reports,
r jT I HL expediency of improving the resource of distilled spirits,
X as an article of revenne, to the greatcft pia&icable extent,had
been noticed upon another occasion. Various eonliderations
might be added to thofr, then acduccd, to evince it. Bur they
arc too obvious tojuftify the detail. There is fcarceW an attitude
in which the object can present itlelf, which doe* not invite, by
all the inducements of found policy and public good, to take a
strong andeffc&ual hold of it.
Ti c manner of doing it, or in other voids, the mode of collec
tion, appears to be only point about which adiificultyor ques
t Â«>n can anfe. If that suggested be liable to just obie&ions, the
united information and wildom of the lcgiflative body enlure the
fubftiturion of a more perftft plan.
The Secretary, however, begs leave to remark, that there ap
pear to him two leading principles; one or the other of which
lnuft iieicffirilv chara&crize whatever plan may be adoprrd. One
of them .makes thefecurity of the revenue to depend chiclly on the
vigilance of the public, officers ; the other rests it, eifentially, on the
integrity of the individualr, intereftcd to avoid the payment oi it.
The firl't is tbe basis of a plan fiibmittcd by the Secretary ; the
lad has pervaded most, if not all the systems which have been hi
therto pra&ifed upon, in ditiennt parts of the United States. The
oaths ot the dealers have been almoit the only security tor their
compliance with the laws.
It cannot be too much lamented, that these have been found an
inadequate dependence. But experience has, on every trial, ma
mfeftcd them to be such. Taxes or duties, relying for tlu ir col
lcttionon that security, wholly, 01 almost wholly, are uniformly
unpiodu&ivc : And they cannot fail to be unequal, as long as men
continue to be discriminated by unequal portions of ic6litude.
The moll confcicntious will pay most; the leuft conscientious,
least.
The impulse of intcreft, always fufficicntly great, alts with pe
culiar force in matters of this kind in to which a loole
mode of thinking is too apt to prevail. The want of a h.ibit of
appreciating proprrly the nature of the public rights, renders thct
impulse, in such cafcs, too frequently an overmatch for the fenfeof
obligation; and the cvafions, which are perceived or fufpe&ed to
be pra&ifed by some, prompt others to imitation, by the power
ful motive of lelf-clcfence. They inier, that they mull follow the
example, or be unable to maintain an advantageous competition
in the buiinefs; an alternative very perplexing to all bur men of
exatt probity, who arc thereby rendered in a great frieafurc vic
tims to a principle of legislation, which does not fufficientlv ac
cord with the bias of human nature. And thus the laws become
fourees of difeburagement and lofsto honest industry, and of profit
?nd advantage to perjury and fraud.
It is a truth that cannot be kept too confhntly in view, that all
revenue laws, which are so conftru&cd as to involve a lax and dc
fe6live execution, are inftrumcnts of oppression to the most meri
torious part of thofc on whom thev immediately opcYate, and of
additional buithcns on the community at large.
Tlu- 1. ft cftVft is produced in two ways. The deficiencies in
the funds (which, in the main, aflord only partial exemption*)
mull be funplied from other taxes: And the charge* ot collc&ion,
which, m most cases, are nearly the fame, whether a tax or duty
yield much or little, occasion an accumulation of the ultimate ex
pcijce of furnifbing a given turn to the treasury.
Another, and a fcriouscvil,chargeable on the system oppo
fitq to that proposed, is, that it leads to frequent and familiar vio
lations of oaths; which by loofeniug one of the strongest binds
of fotiety, and wcaknim; one of the piincipal fccurities to liteand
property, offends not less tgainft the maxims of good government
and lound policy, than those ot religion and morality.
It may not be impr*>por iurjtlu,r to remark, that the two great
objettiym to the clafsof duties denominated cxcifcs, are inappli
cable to the plan fuggeftrd. These obje&ions arcâFirst, thefum
v)ur\ jurifdiiiion confidcd to the officers of cxcife ; in derogation
from thccouric of the common law, and the right ps trial by jury:
And Tecondly/the general power vested in the fame ofliccis of w
fiting and searching indjeriminateh the houses, stores and other
buildings of the dealers in exc.iCcd articles. But by the plan pro
poled, the officers to be employed arc to be clothed with no fu h
fumm ryjurifdittion, and their difcreiionary power ot vifitmg and
inarching it to be reftri&cdto iliofeplaces, which the dealersthem
fclvcs thall designate by public inligniacxr marks, as the de polito
rics of the articles on which the duties are to be laid. Hcncc it is
one of the recojnmcn'dattons of the plan, that it is not liable to thofc
ohje6tfons.
Duties cf the kind proposed are not novel in the United States ;
as has been intimated in another place. They have cxifted to a
considerable extent, under fevci jl of the state governments, parti
cularly in MafTachufetts, Cor.nc&icut and Pcnnfylvania. In Con
necticut,! ftatc exemplary for its attachment to popular principles,
â¢ not only alf ardent spirits, but forcisii articles ot cohfnmption, ge
nerally, have been the fubjcÂ£ls of an cxcife, or inland duty.
If the supposition, that duties of this kind arc attencicd with
greater cxpence in the collc&ion than taxes on land, should fcem
an argument for pre feeing the latter, it may be obfcvVed, that the
fa6l ought not too readily to be taken for granted. The ftatc of
things in England is fomctimes referx dtoas an example on this
point. But there thq (malincfs of the expcncc-in the colle&ion of
the land tax, is to be ascribed to the peculiar modification of it:
which proceeding without new aflVlTincnts, to a fix d
standard long fincc adjuflcd, totally disregards the comparative, v?â
luc of lands and the variations in their value. T1 ' confequcnce
of this is an inequality, so palpliDlc and extreme, as would be like
ly to be ill rclifhrd by the landholders of the United States. If
in jiuifuitof greater equably, accurate periodical valuations or af
fiftmrnts are. to afford a rnlej >it may well be doubted whether the
exprnce of a land-tax will not*always exceed tha: of the kiud of
duties piQpofed.
Th ingenious, but fallacious hypothecs, that all taxes on con
fnmption fall with accumulated weight, on,land, is now
too g. ncrally and too fatisfadorily exploded, 10 require to be
combated here. It has become an acknowledged truth, that in
the operation of thoic.uxc s, every fptcies of -copjtal and induftr7
contribute their proportion to the 1 evenuc ; andt:o<\feqtiently, u'
as far is they can be iua.de substitutes for taxes on.lands, ler\ -
to exempt them from an undue Ihare ot the pulilic burthen *

jun. Goldsmith and Jeweller, No. 76, Mai ket-tlrcet.
Thefj prints are the firft of a ferics, in which it is proposed to
represent ifoe mod hnportant events of the American Revolution.
No period of the history of man, is more ioterefting than thai
in which we have lived. The memory of fcencs in which were
laid the foundations of that free government, which feeures our
national and individual happiness, must cvei remain dear to us,
and to posterity; and if national pride be in any cafe judicable,
Americans have a right to glofy in having given to the world at)
example, whose influence is rapidly spreading the love of free
dom through other nations, and every where ameliorating the
condition of men.
1893
To afliiltn preserving the memory of the illuftiious events which*
have marked this period of our country's glonry, as well as of the
men who have been the mnft important actors in them, is the ob
je& of this undertaking History will do julVicc to an acra so im
portant ; but to be read, the language in which it isÂ» written must
be understoodâthe language of paintiug is and intelli
gible in all nations, and every age.
As several years of his time, and a very confideraMe expencc,
arc neceflWv to accoinpliHi this undertaking, it would bean im
prudent facrifiee to the mere hope of reputation to go more deeply
into it, without a probability of ultimate fueccfs:âThat he may
judge of the degree of this probability, Mr. Trumbull, by thead
vhre of his friends, proposes this fubfci iption, and flatters himfelE
with a hope of meeting that pftrouage from his countrymen,
which will juflily his pxirfuing the objecfc with ardor; and with
out which it is lmpoflible that so cxpenlive a work ihould be con-
tinued.
Thefubjefts proposed to be reprefented,in addition to the tw*
foregoing,.of Bunker's-Hif! and Quebec, areâ
* The Declaration of Independence,
* Battle at Trenton,
* Battle of Prucetown,
SuRRENDtR of General Bur Coyne,
Treaty with France,

* Surrender of Yor k-T o w n ,
Treaty of Peace,
Evacuation of New-York,
Resignation of General Washington,
ThÂ«Â» a* c h at Trenton,
Inauguration of the President of the Unit in Statu.
Each pitjtuie will contain portraits of the principal characters
who were present at the scene icprefented. Tliofe marked with
liars, are confidcrably advanced ; and the prints from the whole
will he executed of the fame lize, and by the moll eminent en
gravers. '
