SPEECH
OF THE
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES,
TO BOTH HOUSES OF CONGRESS.
Fellow Citizens of the Senate, and
House of Representatives,
xN meeting you again I feel much fatisfa&ion in being able
to repeat my congratulations on the favorable profpefts which
continue to dillinguifh our public affairs.âThe abundant fruits of
another year have blefled our country with plenty, and with the
means of a flourifhing commerceâThe progress of public credit
is witnessed by a confide rable rife of American Stock abroad as
well as at homeâAnd the revenues allotted for this and other na
tional purposes, have been produttive beyond the calculations by
which they were regulatedâThis latter circumstance ts the more
pleasing, as it is not only a proof of the fertility of our resources,
but as it allures us of a further increase of the national refpeftabi
lity and credit ; and let me add, as it bears an honorable tefti
roony to the patriotism and integrity of the mercantile and marine
part of the citizensâThe pun&uality of the former in discharging
their engagements has been exemplary
In conform ing to the powers vested in me by the aÂ£ts of the
lad feflion, a loan of three millions of florins, towards which some
provisional measures had pievioufly taken place, has been com
pleted in Holland, as well the celerity with which it has been
filled, as the nature of the terms (considering the more than ordi
nary demand for borrowing created by the situation of Europe)
give a reasonable hope, that the further execution of those powers
may proceed with advantage and success. The Secretary of the
Treasury, has my direction to communicate such further parti
culars as may be rcquifite for more precise information.
Since your last fcilions, I have received communications, by
which it appears, that the diftrift of Kentucky, at present a part
of Virginia, has concurred in certain proportions contained in a
Jaw of th at State ; in conCequence of which the diftrift is to be
come a diftinft member of the union, in cafe the requisite fanÂ£lion
of Congress be addedâFor this fanflion application "Is now made
âI shall cause the papers on this Very impoitant tranfaftion to be
laid before you.âThe liberality and harmony with which it has
been condutted, will be found to do great honor to. both the par
ties ; and the sentiments of warm attachment to the union and its
present government, expressed by our fellow-citizens of Kentucky,
cannot fail to add an affectionate concern for their particular wel
fare, to the great national impreflions under which you will de
cide on the cafe submitted to you.
It has been heretofore known to Congress, that frequent incur
sions have been made on our frontier settlements by certain ban
ditti of Indians, from the northwest fide of the Ohio: I hefe,
with some of the tribes dwelling on and near the Wabafh, have of
late been particularly active in their depredations ; and being
emboldened by the impunity of theif crimes, and aided by such
parts of the neighboring tribes as could be seduced to join in
their hostilities, or afford them a retreat for their priloners and
plunder, they have, instead Â©f listening to the humane invitations
and overtures made on the part of the United States, renewed their
violences with frefti alacrity and greater effect. The lives of a
number of valuable citizens have thus been facrificed, and some
of thÂ«m under circumllances peculiarly (hocking, whilst otheis
have been carried into a deplorable captivity.
These aggravated provocations rendered it essential to the fafety
of the Wettein Settlements, that the aggressors ihould b<* made
sensible, that the government of the union is not less capable ol
punifliing their crimes, than it is disposed to refpett their rights,
and reward their attachments. As this objett could not be effect
ed by deienfive measures, it became necefTary to put in force the
ast, which empowers the President to call out the militia for the
protedion of the Frontiers. And I have accordingly authonfed
an expedition, in which the regular troops in that quarter are
combined with such draughts of militia as were deemed
The event of the measure is yet unknown to me. The Secietai)
Â©f War is directed to lay before you a statement of the informa
tion on which it isfounded, as well as an estimate of the expcnce
with which it will be attended.
The disturbed lituation of Europe, and particularly the ciitical
posture of the great maritime powers, whilftit ought to make us
more thankful for the general peace and security enjoyed by the
United States, reminds us, at the fame time of the circumspec
tion with which it becomes us to preserve these bleflings. It re
quires also that we should not overlook the tendency ot a war,
and even of preparations for war among the nations molt, cori
ecrned in a&ive commerce with this country, to aDiidg- t ie
means, and thereby at least enhance the price of tranfportmg its
valuable productions to their proper markets. I recommend it
tÂ® your serious reilcÂ£horÂ»s how far, and in what mode, it ma r b
expedient to guard againil embarrafTments from these contingen.
IeÂ«, by fuel) encouragements to our own navigation as will ren-
der Qur commerce and agriculture less dependent on foreign bot
toms, which may fail us in the very moment most interesting to
both of thefs great objetts. Our fifheries, and the transportation
of our own produce, offer us abundant means for guarding our-
Iclves against this evil.
Your altcntion seems to be not less due to that particular branch
of our trade which belongs to the Mediterranean. So many cir
cumstances unite in rendering the present state of it dillrefsful to
us, that you will not think any deliberations mifcmployed which
may lead to its relief and prote&ion.
The laws you have already passed for the eftablilhment of a Ju
diciary system, have opened the doors of justice to all defcrip-
ions of persons. You will consider in your wisdom, whether
'mprovements in that system may yet be made ; and particularly
whether an uniform process of execution on (entences issuing from
the Federal Courts, be not desirable through all the States.
The patronage of our commerce, of our merchants and feamcn,
has called tor the appointment of Consuls in foreign countries. It
<ems expedient to regulate by law the cxercife of that junfdic-
ion, and those functions which are permitted them, either by
express convention, or by a friendly indulgence in the places of
ieir residence. The Consular Convention too, with his Most
Christian Majcfty, has stipulated in certaio cases, the aid of the
national authority to his Consuls eftabli(bed here.âSomelegifla-
ive provision is requisite, to carry these flipulations into full effeÂ£b
The establishment of themilitiaâof a mintâof standards of
weights and measuresâos the poft-office and post-roads, are fub
jeÂ£ts, which (I presume) you wi 11 resume of course. and which
are abundantly urged bv their own importance.
Gentlemen of the House of Representatives,
THE fufficiency of the revenues you have established for the
objects to which they are appropriated, leaves no doubt that the
refiduaiy provisions will be commensurate to the other objects fo r
which the public faith Hands now pledged. Allow me more
over to hope that it will be a favorite policy with you not mere-
to secure a payment of the interest of the debt funded, but as
far, and as fact as the growing resources of the country will per
mit, to exonerate it of the principal itfelf. The appropriation
youhave made of the Western Lands, explains your dispositions
on this fubjeft, and I am persuaded the sooner that valuable fund
can be made, to contribute along with other means, to the actual
reduction of the public debt, the more salutary will the measure
be to every Public as well as the more fatisfaftory to our
conftitu^nts.
Gentlemen of the Senate, and
House of Representatives,
IN pursuing the various and weighty bufincfs of the present
feflion, I indulge the fulleft pcrfuafion that your confutations will
be equally marked with wisdom, and animated by the love ot
your country. In whatever belongs to my duty, you (hall have
all the co-operation which an undiminifhed zeal for its welfare
can inlpire. It will be happy for vis both, and our best reward,
if by a fuccefsful administration of our refpcftive trusts, we can
make the eftablithed government more and more instrumental in
promoting the good of our fellow citizcns, and more and more
theobjcft of their attachment and confidence.

TUMULT AT St. ETIENNE, IN FOREZ.
A number of people had afiembled on the 4th
instant, of which M. Birtheas was thcoftenfible
cause.
The commandant sent a detachment of the
National Guard to condudt M. Birtheas to the
Guardhouse. âThis detachment was followed by
a very great croud of people of both sexesâit was
feared the guard would be inforticientâit was
accordingly doubled, and being even then not
of fufficient strength, M. Birtheas, by way of
fafety was imprisoned.
He was accused of having monopolised corn.
__To appease the people, his house was exam
ined, in which there was found only a fiViall
quantity of corn. After this, the guards about
the prison were almost dispersed, and the peo
ple were proceeding to break open the gates.
Neither prayers nor entreaties could hinder them
they broke them openâseized M. Birtheas,
and murdered him ! '
Next day (the 9th) the inftirgents proceeded
of their own accord, to the election of new Mu
nicipal Officers, and to make regulations ref
pe<sting the prices of corn. On this a number

The aflembly, remitted theprocefs and punifii
men t of this fhameful bufmefs to the Tribunal of
Lyons, who are charged to pursue all instigators
and agents in this horrid affair with the molt
pointed severity of the laws.
M. de Sillery communicated to the aflembly, in
telligence, that in the plains of Jales, at the foot
of the Cevennes, an army of 20,000 Gardes Nati
onalesare allembled,headedbya troublefomeprieft
named La Bajlide, sword in hand, with a crols

oath to set 011 foot a solemn Crusade for the re
formation of abuses at Nifmes.
Saturday, OCI. i,
The Assembly proceeded to lire order of rlie
day, the difcullion of the affair of the 6th nf Oct
Mr. Chabraud undertook the defence of Mr.
d'Orleans, with great warmth and zeal, read
ing and commenting on several parts of the re
mitter of the police, which were favorable to Mi. *
d'Orleans. He alio read fonie letters, complain
ing that the teftitnony ot several persons of cre
dit was not received.
Mr. d'Ellournal demanded that tliefe papers
lould be sent to the Chatelet.
Which was oppofedbyMr. Mirabeau, who de
clared that he Hood forward as the accuser ofthe
Chatelet, which he would profecuteto his grave.
The propoficion of Mr. d'Ellournal was reject
ed.
Mr. Abbe Maury said, that in an affair of this
fort, the Allembly should follow the ilricftelt rules
of justiceâhe therefore proposed to hear the ac
cused fii ft, if they wiflied to speak, then the wit
nelies, and afterwards such members of the Af
feinbly as should desire to give their opinion oil
the measures the Aflembly ought to take.
Mr. Goupil wished that such members as were
witnesses should withdraw, and lliat tliofe only
who were dilinteretted lliould take part in the
debate.
Mr. Mirabeau deflred that an exception should
be made in favor of those deputies, who having
been summoned to give their testimony, declared
they had noth?ng to depose.
The Abbe Maury then delivered a speech, in
which he argued that the Aflembly ought not to
pronounce the absolution of Mr. d'Orleans. He
laid he lliould notoppofethe decree that there is
110 ground of accufution againll Mr. Mirabeauâ
there did not exist charges againll him fviflicienr-
ly Itrong to support the decilion of the Chatelet,
but that the luuation of Mr. d'Orleans was dif
ferent.
A Prince of the blood accused ofbeing seen on
the morning of the 6th of Otfiober, encouraging,
the allaflins who maflacred the gardes du corps,ana
attempted even the Queen, ought as a defend
ant worthy ofHejiry 4th, to prostrate himfelf in
the fencftuary of jultice ; and to provoke its se
verest scrutiny ;he declared that it was by such
ineansalfo, he could clear up his innocence, and
that his friends,and the friends of his reputation,
ought to advise him to demand the vengeance of
the tribunals.
Mr. Mirabeau then appeared in the tribunal,,
and declaimed with great warmth against the
proceedings of the Chatelet, which he declared
to be a monument that would attest to future ages
the iniquity and anticipation of the judges of this
tribunal. ' He then examined the different accu
sations which were made against him, and an
swered them all in a fatisfacftory manner.
Mr. Barnhave undertook the defence of Meflrs.
d'Orleans andMirabeau,bothof whom he declared
to be irreproachable ; and it was the judgment
of the Chatelet alone which merited the indigna
tion of every good citizen.
I The Aflembly divided 011 the question, and de
clared the two deputies free from all inculpation.
Sunday, 08. 3.
A letter was read from Mr. Silles, a young of
ficer, who diftinguilhed himfelf at Nanci, mo
destly thanking the Aflembly for the eulogium
they had bestowed upon him, and desiring that
this might be conlidered less as the exercise of a
virtue than as the performance of a duty.
A report was made to the Afleinbly of commo
tions in Languedoc, with information that the
people of Carcaflonne Ihewed a difpofuion to re
volt.
The Aflembly decreed,that the Executive pow
er Ihould be called upon to interpol'e, and with
tii&o
Â»some regular troops to put an end to tliefe dis
turbancesâSeveral decrees were also palled re
fpedlin-g the finances.
Mr. d'Orleans {the late Duke) delivered a
speech in exculpation of himfelf. He obierved,
that as the Allembly had, the day before, decreed
that there was no ground to accuse him, lo it re
mained only for liiin to prove that there was no
ground even to suspect him.
Monday, Oft. 4.
A letter from the marine minister gave inform
ation, chat the fermentation at Bred, which was
thought to have been appeased, subsisted still;
that he had discharged the crew ot the Leopard,
who had individually received from the General
Aflemblv of Sr. a certificate that they
were the Saviours of that colony, and that the
municipality of Brest: had struck medals in their
favor, which were distributed among the crew.
The Aflembly ordered this letter to the Colo
nial Committee, and directed that the President
fbould writeto the municipality ofÃreft, in order
to put a flop to the delivery of the medals.
PARIS, Sept. 19.
Extract of a litter from Marfcilles, sfuguft, 30,
" A large Spanilh (hip armed, en flute, loaded
ivith cordage ancj all kinds of naval ltores, from
Cadiz, bound to Carthagena, was taken jaft as
ihe palled through the gut of Gibraltar, the be
ginning of this month, by an Algerine Rover of
56 guns. After a very desperate aiTtion of thir
teen glafl'es, flie was carried into Algiers. They
fought with equal bravery a longtime, and were
molt of the time within pistol fliot of each other,
which caused an horrid (laughter on both fides,
particularly among the pirates, who were repul
sed twice in attempting to board, with the loss
of near 100 men cut to pieces.
" Notwithstanding this dreadful carnage, the
< Barbarians made a third attempt with such irre
fiftable fury, that, in spite of all refinance, they
became conquerors. The people 011 board the
Spanilh ship behaved with the greatest bravery,
and fought with a surprising resolution. It is
laid, that the Captain and part of the crew were
Irifli, and that the former was killed by a lance
in the heat of the action. The Pirates fuffered
prodigiously in officers and men, having had all
the formerkilled,and most of the latter wound
ed ; and, their ship was so much pierced and flut
tered, that she funk as she was towing into Al-
giers
" Three days before, the above pirate was at
tacked by two armed ships of 18 guns each, under
Ruffian colours, which ihe beat off, after a very
severe conflict of an hour and twenty minutes.
In this aiftion she had her sore-topmast carried
away, and her rigging materially damaged.
" She was very audacious, and fought all the
time under the Algerine bloody flag."

Â£dentof the United States to both Houses, when
Mr. Livermore took the Chair-
On motion of Mr. Lawranct, the committee a
<doptedthe following resolution,
Resolved, Thatit is the opinion of this commit
tee, that an Addreis ought to be presented by
the House to the President of the United States,
in answer to his Speech to both Honfes, with af
iurances that this House will, without delay, pro
ceed to take into consideration the various and
important matters, recommended to their atten
tion.
The above resolution being agreed to by the
House, the following Members were appointed to

Mr. Tucker..
Mr. motion,refpeclingnewfpapers,
which *was laid on the table yesterday, was read,
and taken into conlideration.
â¢' Mr. Fitzfimons said, he hoped the resolution
would not be agreed to : Tlje fubjetft, said lie,
lias frequently "been difcufledâ'and inuch expence
of time has been incurred. For his own part he
knew of no reasons which existed that should in
duce the House, at this feflion, to deviate fioni
Toriner practice,and the custom which had always
been obfervedby the old Congressâdebating the
fubjedl would probably be attended with as much
expence, as taking the papers in the usual way.
Mr. Madifen offered some obje&ions to the
motion ; He was in favor of taking the whole of
the publications, or noneâas taking a part would
be giving a preference to particular prefl'es, and
would favor of partiality.
Mr. iViillamJoH supported the motion : lie beg- i
ge gentlemen to consider, that if 110 limitation I
was to be set to the number of newspapers, what
theexpence might amount ,to. He said he did
not know the exaot number printed in the city,
whether ten or fifteen'; but if Congress made it
a rule to take all that was, or might be printed,
they may be encreafed m> a hundredâand after
the encreale ot the house, by the addition to the
1 epi dentation, it will be worth while for a prin
tel U P a P a P er nieerly to supply Congress.
ile laid he was disposed to give encouragement
to the pi els, in printing Booksâwhich would be
really advantageous to K the country, by render
ing importations unnecelfary; but as to newspa
pei s, they are a species of printing, which dies
with the day.âHe mentioned the number of pa
pers formerly taken by the House, among which
were foine (laid he) that were never read by
any bodyâlie was for limiting the number, and
therefore had mentioned threeâHill he was not
tenacious of that number ; but whatever else was
determined in the bufinefs,he thought there ought
to be a limitation.
Mr. Livermore said he fliould vote for the reso
lution-âwhich being put, was carried in the af
firmative 22 to I J.
A meflage was received from the Senate, in
forming that they have concurred in the resolu
tion of the House for the appointment of Chap

Congress of the United States.

don, Moore and Partridge were appointed the committee.
r The reading of the papers communicatcd by the Secretary at

municated in a series of accounts from private persons, public cha
racters, and bodies, in letters, memorials and representations, to
the President of the United States, the Secretary at War, See.
The Clerk, then read an eftimaie of the expences attending the

1500 militia and about 400 Federal Troops, are employed on this

in a rep irt which wai read. Â° -i
Mr. Williamfon moved,that this Addrefsbe referred to acorn*!
mitteeof the whole house, and made the order of the day lor to- 1
morrow, which motion was adopted. J
Mr. Lawrance moved that a number of copies be printed, for
the use of the house ; this motion was fecondetl by Mr. Jackson ;
Mi". Williamfon objcÂ£led, he laid that inconveniences had resulted
from printing reports of committers in times pall ; in their im
mature state they had found the way into the ucwfpapers, and
bien miftakcn for the decifiotis of the house.
Mr. Jackson observed that the addref-. contained matters of ve
ry great importance, which rendered it necelTary that every mem
ber should have a copy before him ; he could fee no inconvenience
that would arise, even if it Ihould be publillied in the papers ; it
might give life to observations without doors, which jnight uot
be unworthy the attention of the house.
lie saw no danger of any millake's arising from publilhing re
pous of their committeesâtha"y Were" easily diftinjjiiilhed from
the a&s of the Legislature. But in the prelent inltance, he fa-w no"
for its being inserted in the news-papers, because it hap
pened to be printed lor the use oi the House ; nor did he second
the motion with such a design.
It being observed by Mr. B >udinot, that it had not been custom
ary to print the report of the committee on similar occasions, the
motiou was withdrawn. Adjourned till to-morrow.
Philadelphia, Dec. 11.
A CORRESPONDENTobferves, That the encreafe of the im
port duty exceeds even the moftfanguine expectation of the friends
to government : Those gloomy fouls who predi&ed that the last
year's importation of goods was more than' the country would
want in seven years, may be told, that their predictions are un
founded ; that the great incrcafe of people in the back country
will naturally increase the importations for many years to come ;
nor is there a doubt that Agriculture alone will amply repay the
cost of all these imports
The amount of duties for 'the three months
ending Sept. 30 last, in the port of Philadelphia, is
The amount of duties ior the fame period, in
he poit of New-York, is
Oar country may justly be felicitated 011 the favorable afpeft of
its public affairs, Agreeable to the speech of the President of the
United States to both Houses of Congrefs,the people more than re
alize all the anticipations of the friends to the government, now
happily established ; and what adds to the pleasure of the con*
templation is, that our civil rulers appear to derive the highest fa
tisfa&ion from the success of public meafurcs, and the peace and
freedom erf their constituents.
ExhaEl of a letterfrom Bojlon, tQ the Editor, dated Nov. 29.
" Our great and good Citizen Mr. Bow do 1 n has paid the debt
of nature. âAs in ins life, so in his death, he exhibited a native
firmnefs of mind, which (hews his charafler better than the plau
dits of a world.âSeeing the King, that comes to many arrayed in
fall approaching, he prel'erved his faitk.andphilofophyâ
regulated the concerns of his familyâbid them each a paternal
adieuâand then wished for nothing but that the stroke of ft he
" conqueror " might be speedy. His superior he has not left behind
him in Mairachufetts,to fay no more. His fame was of that fpecics
whieh not being demanded, or eagerly fought after, was more free
ly, and genuinely celebrated :âit was not sullied by ollcntation,
chicane, or those popular arts, which, in some nations, have made
weak and unworthy men popularâit was deserved, without an
undue solicitude to fecurc itâand it will last, when thonfands,
who built theii's on deception, will be forgotten."
Extratf of * letter from Dr. Ja m e s Anderson, Edi

" I was highly flattered lately by a letter from
Mr. Washington, President of the United

his countenance :o the forwarding of my intend

many eminent men on the fame fubjetS, and no

as to countenance it.
" I hear with pleasure of the prosperity of
your riling (tates, and ihall ever be happy to con
tribute my mite to augment their prosperity.
Narrow-minded persons there are here who too
often think the prosperity of others, dimiuilhes
their own ; lam not one of those. Could the
happy time ever arrive, when mankind in general
fliould become truly wife, we lhould then fee
them emuloufly contending, who should be fore
moft in promoting the welfare of each other ; but
that a;ra we nmit not hope to fee : we may, how
ever, wish for it, and make approximations to

pleasure to learn that your universities are flour

but Poetry has the advantage of leaving the fpi

agitates, and appears to distress. It is true.
true Poet will always have such absolute power
over his reader as to give him pleasure and pain
at will ; but the painful sensations arising from
poetic fictions must be of that kind which >av e
heard called pleating : Let any one recollect his
sensations at the recital of a good tragedy ; our
distress often amounts tofiglis and tears ; yet it is
pleating : Whence arises this feenungcontradic

sciousness that we are diftrefleil by our own con

but momentary, and when we recoiled: that it is
all an unreal mockery, we are pleased with that art
which could enchant us out ofonrfenfes ; wears !

the word was in nioft instances but a vehicle to

SPRING, put into my hands by a fellow-Student,

fellow-Students who read the Ga?ette or the li

may be of use to his future compositions.
Describing the breaking up of Winter, and its
effects, he thus proceeds
THE Sun now gaining pow'r, drives the pale snow,
Diffolv'd, in torrents from the mountain tops;
Fad ruftiing to the plain they join, and dream,
Pouring a deluge on the fields around.
The rivers swell and pais their fixed bounds.
Thelow'ring Heav'ns, drefs'd in black'ning horrors,
Spread desolation o'er the weeping world,
Yet seem to mourn her sorrows. Often now
When fable night descends, mantled in clouds
And dorms, and treble darkness not her own,
The wind loud howls, the torrent roars.
Upon the humble roof, forc'd by the gale,
The rain and hail patter. Lull'd by the found.
The Miller, weary, warm, and felf secure,
Unheeded, hears the warfare over head;
Till fwell'd and swelling, with resistless force
The Waters bear away the mounded Dam.â ââ
He darts half sleeping prays. The timbers fall
Clattering. Crufli'd, immingled with the ruin,
The fweepy deluge bears the Man away.
In such a night at this, in such a storm,
Forc'd from thy cot, where rural plenty reign'd,
With rural elegance and heavenly love ;
Didst thou Amanda, weeping take thy way.
V/illiam, thy love, thy hulband and thy pride,
Had arm'd in hade, and join'd a daring band,
To fight for those he held more dear than life
His lov'd Amanda and her lovely Babes.
Alas! She knew not that her William fell,
Leading the valiant corps. Angels of mercy
Wafted wide,the voice of busy fame
Forc'd by the Briton's desolating hand,
She from the flames had fnatch'd her little ones.
While trusty Tom % grown grey in honest service
(Who flav'ry knew but by the hated name)
Bore in those arms, where William once was borne,
His pretty Babes. Thus to the warring winds
And elements (he flies for refuge from %
Left-pitying Man. Bare to the rain, expos'd
Her auburn Trellis. The rapid torrent
Roars across their road : See they mount the Br,dge .

And lo ! where Willi am comes with glory crown d,
To meet his laithful fair. Patriot fouls
Around him tune their Harps to everlasting
