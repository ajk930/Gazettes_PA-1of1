General. But it was the royal authority whicl
called them together : without it, they could not
have afiemWed : and the fame authority had <
-right to dismiss them at its pleasure : it "S there
fore evident that their power was always subor
dinate to that of the Monarch. But this con
sequence does not follow. The royal authority
in England, has the power of convoking, pÂ»o
rojruing and diflolving Parliament : yet Parha
mfnt is not subordinate to the royal authority,
but superior to it ; as the whole is fupenor to .
third part. The sovereignty is in Parliament,o
the legislative power ; not in the or
executive. So the sovereignty might be in
States General, comprehending the King. 11
there are " twenty examples of the States Gene
ral convening and separating, by the fimpje or
ders of the King s " if ".the Dauphin Charle
Vth, during the detention of King John hi.
father, convoked several times the States Gene
ral, and difmilTed them when he judged proper
it will not follow from all this, that the State,
â were not apart of the sovereignty s nor will it
follow that they had no authority but to adviit
and remonstrate. " If the fem.ments ofthÂ«
Italian author were true," add
Â« it would follow that the authority of Parlia
tnents and courts or companies, whose power is
nothing but an emanation from the royal autho
rity would be suspended, during the session oi
the States General ; a pretension absolutely con
trary to the usages and maxims of the kingdom.
But how does it appear, that the power of the
Parliaments and courts or companies, were ema
nations of the royal authority ? There is more
probability that they were originally committee:
of the States General, and in that cafe their pow
er would not be suspended, unless it were ex
prefsly suspended by a resolution or order o
the Hates. But ifthefe tribunals were only ;
part of the executive power, and constituted bj
the King, it would not follow from this concel
fion that the States General were no part of tli.
sovereignty or legislative power. Is there on<
national acft upon record, which acknowledge
the King of France to be an unlimited sovereign
If not, the opinion of Davila appears ti
be better founded, than that of his Critick
There was alwavs a rivalry between the roya
authority and that of the States, as there is now
between the power of the King and tliat of the
National Aflembly, and as there ever was, and
will be in every legislature or re
eonfifts of two branches only. Ihe prop
medy then would have been the fame as it must
be mow to new model the legislature make it
conlift 'of three equipenderant independent
branches, and make the executive power one of
them â¢ in this way, and in no other, can an equi
librium be formed, the only antidote .against ri
valries The rivalry between the Kings and
States General in France, proceeded in the rtrug-.
gle for superiority, till the power of the former
increafinrand that of the latter diminifliing, the
States General were laid aside after 1614. and the
crown on the head of Lewis XlVth, in fadt, but
not of right, became absolute : in the fame man
ner as the rivalry between the Popes and general
councils proceeded till the latter were aifconti
nued and his Holiness became infallibleâin short,
every man, and every body of men, is and has a
rival. When the struggle is only between two,
1 whether individuals or bodies, it continues til
one is swallowed up, or annihilated, and the
other becomes absolute matter. As all this Â« a
necefTary confequenceand eftedt of the emulation
which nature has implanted in our bosoms, it is
wonderful that mankind have so long been igno
rant of the remedy, when a third party for an
umpire, is one so easy and obvious.

ADDRESS
Of the HEBREW CONGREGATION in New
port, Rhode-lfland. JtT .- e c
To the PRESIDENT of the UNITED STATES of
AMERICA,
SIR
PERMIT the children of theftockof Abraham,
to approach you, with the moll cordial affec
tion and ellecm for your person and meritâand
to join with our fellow citizens in welcoming
you to Newport. , , . r
With pleasure we reflect on those daysâthole
days of difficulty and danger, when the Godot
Israel, who delivered David from the peril of the
sword, fliielded your head in the day of battle ;
and we rejoice to think, that the fame fpmt who
retted in thebofora of the greaily beloved Daniel,
enabling himtoprefide over the provinces of the
Babylonish empire, rests, and eter will relt, up
on you, enabling you to discharge the arduous
duties of CHIEF MAGISTRATE in thele States.
Deprived as we heretofore have been of the in
valuable rights of free citizens, we now l> u b a
deep sense of gratitude to the almighty disposer
of all events) behold a government ererted by
the MAJESTY OF THE PEOPLEâa govern
ment, which to bigotry gives no fan<ftionâto per
secution no assistance ; but generously affording
to ALL liberty of conscience, and immunities of
citizenship: Deeming every one of whatever na
tion, tongue or language, equal part* of the great
govermental machine. ThiÂ» so and ex
tensive federal union, whose base is philanthro
py, mutual confidence, and public virtue, we can
not but acknowledge to be the work of the great
God, who ruleth in the armies of heaven,and a
mong the inhabitants of the earth, doing what
soever fcemeth to him good.
For all the blessings of civil and religious li
berty, which we enjoy under an equal and benign
administration, we desire to fend up our thanks
to the ancient of days, the great preserver ofmen,
beseeching him that the Angel who conducted
our forefathers through the wilderness into the
promised land, may graciously conduct you thro
all she difficulties and dangers of this mortal life
âAnd when like Joshua, full of days and full of
honors, you are gathered to your fathers, may
you be admitted into the heavenly paradise, to
partake of the water of life, and the tree of im -
mortality.
Done and Signed by order of the Hebrew Con
gregation ,in Newport, (Rhode-1/land).

Newport, Aitguft 17, 1790-
To the HEBREW CONGREGATION, in Newport,
GENTLEMEN,
WHILE 1 receive with much fatisfaiflion your
Address, replete with expreflions of affec
tion and esteem, I rejoice in the opportunity of
afluring you, that, I ihall always retain a grateful
remembrance of the cordial welcome I experien
ced in my visit to Newport, from all clafl'es of
citizens. The reflexion on the days of difficul
ty and danger which are pad, is rendered the
more sweet from a consciousness that they are |
succeeded by days of uncommon prosperity and
security.
If we have wisdom to make the best use of the
advantages with which we are now favored, we
cannot fail, under the just adininiftration of a
good government, to become a great and a happy
people.
The citizens of the United States of America,
have a right to applaud themselves for having
liven to mankind examples of an enlarged and
liberal policy : A policy worthy of imitation.â
All pofl'efs a like liberty of conscience, and im-
596
Rhade Jft and,
munStitt of c 4 nJzenlhlp. It is How ab more ttiaft
toleration is spoken of, as if it was by the indul
ecnce of one class of people, tliatanother enjoy,
eel the exercise of their inherent natural rights.
For happily the government of the United states,
which gives to bigotry no fandhon, to perfection
no alliltance, requires only that they who ive
under its protection, should demean therafelyM
as good citizens in giving it on all occafionj their
| effectual support. e
It would be inconsistent w.th the fianknefsof
my character not to avow that 1 am plcafed vmlj
vour favorable opinion of my adminiftrat.on, and
fervent wilhes for my felicity. May thech. dre*
of the stock of Abraham, who dwell in this land,
continue to merit and enjoy the good w.l o, the
other inhabitantsâwhile every one shall fit ,a
fafety under his own vine and figtree, and there
shall be none to make him afraid.
May the Father of all Mercies scatter light,ana
not darkness, in our paths, and make us all in
our several vocations urelful here, and in his own
due time and way everlastingly happy
(Signed) WASHINGTON.
