When the political pot boils the (cum rises to the top.
TO THE FREEMEN OF CONNECTICUT
Gentlemen,
A and unbiaflcd Elector is a mod digni.
nified character. Ihe trust reposed in you
by God and the Conftitution,of felecftingthe moll
tic perrons to compose the national and state legi
llatures, if faithfully discharged, will preserve
liberty to you, and be the defence of your chil
dren against the attempts of wicked men. The
molt solemn situation in which a freeman can
llhtid, is when he gives his fuffrage for the ruler
of his country; and tranfa<!tionÂ» of this kind ought
never to be dilated either by levity or party fpi-
Tit. If men, destitute of moral principles and
wisdom, are elected, the destructive meafuresmay
be theirs, but remember it is you who give them
the power ; and the greater lin will lie at youi
door, tor turnifhing them with the opportunity.
The electors ot this state have always proved
themselveS to be lionelt and enlightened men.â
You have generally preferred your belt and mofl
able citizens, and under a firm reliance on you
protection, they have advocated such public mea
lures, as are mod directly for your interelfc; and
have given to themselves and to their conlticu
ents, a dignity in the eyes of the whole union.â
It is already remarked by the moil sagacious ii
othei States, that it Connecticut continues fucl>
inen in the National Legillature, aslhehas alrei
dy furnifhed, she will in a manner hold the bal
ance of power between the opposing interests i
the Union, and continue to herfelf that influence
which the virtue and indultry of her citizen*
merit ; but if at any time she fuffers herfelf to be
duped by deligning candidates ; if she prefe
Tnfrn ofartifice and t he splendor of words, to thof.
whose political wifdoni and experience have be?'
proved ; if.lie forgets the merits of those, wliof
mercantile abilities are able to comprehend th *-
interests of foreign nations, and of the diffei en
states ; if she should be so far ins ituated, as to ele
vate men, whole practice infulis all the facre.
and purelaws of morality, from that moment she
must fink in the Unionâher importance will b<
nieafured by her nar row limits, and her influence
â will fink into perpetual forgetfulnefs.
The motto I have chosen molt decidedly applie
to the present moment. The political bot is boil
ing, and calls up much scum The election o
y our federal representatives draws near,and thoft
lelt-feeking and ambitious men, who wish forthi
places of your present members, are by their in
ilruments, filling all the public prints with flan
der; they are casting every poflible reflection on
Congressâon the members of this stateâon the
measures of the last feflion, and on the official
departments.â 1 hey would fain make you believe
that Congress .have been together fix months,
merely to carry away their wages, and done 110
public bufinefs-they have made use of fly delu
fion and low bufFoonryâ and they endeavor to a
larm all yotir feelings by an insinuation that your
liberties and properties are endangered. That
jealous headed men, lhould do this occasionally
is not furpriiingâand their spleen and confe
quencc is diflipated with their blasts ; but when
we fee such attempts perpetuated in the face of
reason and flubborn fa<fts, it proves a desperate
design to succeed at all events in railing them
selves. If there be any one state in the Union,
particularly benefited by the measures of the last
feflion, Connecticut is the state. It is true the
feflion was long, and produced divifiou of opin
ion, and fometiines heat in difcuflion ; but the
measures which caused this protraction, were such,
that the Connecticut members ought to have con
tended for them through the whole, instead of
half the year, if they could not have been effect
ed sooner. We are told Congress have done
nothing. Is the funding fyftein nothing ? Is
the aflumption of the state debts, and the provi
sion of ways and nieans nothing{? Is the arrange
ment of a national system of national revenue
and its application nothing ? Is it nothing to
bring together and harmonize a thousand oppo
fiig interests, through adiflridt of country, 1200
miles in length,and half that in breadth > Is it
nothing to arrange a plan for the fettlemenc of
accounts between the States amounting to more
than one hundred millions > The two felfions of
Congress which we have seen, had to execute
greater duties than were ever done on earth by
one set of actors; to lay anew all the foundations
of a great nation. Could this be done in a hur
ryâor may we suppose the representatives from
any part ot the Union would fuller themselves to
be driven, in things so interesting to their confti
tuents ? These subjects required much discus
sionâlight was to be collected from the condition
âfrom the advantagesâand from the particular
preflures subsisting in every part of the empire.
Honest and great men had different opinions 011
all these momentous fubjecfts ; it was the cafe in
Congress, and more so in the countryâand had
Congress proceeded with precipitation it would
have con v u lied the empire, and their own heads
would have been forfeited for rashness. Still w e
are told Congress have done nothing. It is now
eighteen months lince their power commencedâ
they have been in felfion ten monthsâand in that
space have done more than the old Congress did
in seven years, when in conlVant felfion, antece
dent to the prefenc government.âWe are told
that Congress lit but four liouts in a day. It is
grantedâbut the greater part of the fame mem
bers spend from four to eight hours in private
committees, in arranging and preparing bulinefs
tor the houseâthis is the molt expeditious me
thod which can be devised, and is a slavery more
than proportionate to the gratitude of their co
lumniators.
The business of compensation is again brought
up. I fliall fay nothing new, but refer you to
the second numberofthis paper, in which it was
Jhewn, that the present compensation, is less than
the average wages given by the assemblies of the
Hates under the old government; the fef
iion was then constantâand is now but part of
the timeâand the members were then more nil
merousâfo that the expertces of government are
now greatly lellened.
I have 110 mind to trace out and repeat to you
til the insinuations which have been made, for I
consider the whole a dirty business, and the work
fa partyâami* have the confidence that
he Electors in Connecticut, will notat this junc

in f> decided a manner supported the interests of
the state. Had they >done otherwise than they
hive done, you mult have condemned them had
ley been the means of curtailing the session,

hey would have deserved rejection for their un

1 am neither the inftrunient, nor the depen

EXTRACTS.
POMP and splendor seem to be the faftionable
recommendations of the times ; whereas virtue
and integrity ought to be the criterion of merit.
1 hefe things have introduced a pernicious emu
lation in dress, which pervades all ranks of peo-
they influence the views and wilhes of
multitudes ; and have excited many to squander
away their estates on gewgaws and trinkets :â
Bankruptcy is invariably the consequence offuch
folly in all countries.
An injury unanswered, in course grows weary
of icfelt, and dies away in a voluntary remorse.

The formidable preparations throughout the
I VC Â» e 'P orts th ' s kingdom, as well as those
tnro Spain, and even those of our neighbours of
trance indicate, in powerful terms, alinoll the
certainty of an approaching war, and seem to
threaten, in the language of lioltile indignation
a general rupture ; yet notwiihltanding all these
â extraordinary exertions, there are extant at this
moment, circular letters of a late date, from the
Com pee de Florida Blanca, to the principals of
the several trading houses in the several seaport
towns of Spain, alluring them, that all intentions
of war are laid aside : advising them to continue
their traJhc with Great Britain asufual, a âd iâ-
luurtg to them the fecttrity and fafety of their
property. J
Yesterday morning Mr. Shaw, the meflenger,
arrived at the duke of Leed's office, with dif!
patches from earl Gower, at Paris.
Mr. Sli.iw reports, that on the road between
Calais and Paris he saw several people who were
pointed outtohim, as being in wait toapprehend
the person of the late duke of Orleans, whom it
was further reported at Calais had received no
tice of this coufpiracy against him, and it is be
lieved he would in consequence return to Lou
don.
The duke of Orleans it is true did go to Brigh
tonâbut from Brighton, on Friday last. he fail
ed for Dieppe.
A Chellea pensioner in Scotland, on his Maief

111 England, fays a Frenchman, humanity is
extended to the animals which are deltined to
the llaughter-houfe. Familhed dogs are not per

During the late American war, a Negro, be
longing to Colonel Laugdon, followed his matter
in a painful march : â Seeing the Colonel almott
overcome with fatigue, hefaid, Mafter,you fuffcr
great deal, but you fight for liberty ; mi too fuffcr,
â¢with patience, if me have liberty to defend ! The
Colonel gave him this precious gift on the spot ;
and he has not fiilce had a more zealous defen
dei, a more disinterested friend, 01* a more faith
ful fervanr.
1 here is no example of a Negro having return
ed ingratitude for the gift of liberty. They are
not, however, ignorant that you only relforethat
of which you had no right to deprive them. Who
can fee without being affected, .ihehonelf James
(the Negro whole ane dote is every where known)
approach the beneficent Quaker who hadjnlt
given him his liberty, and hear him fay : " Give
me thy hand, generoiSs man, that I may place it
On my heart, that this may be the firftaftofthat
liberty which you reltore to me.
In former times it was counted a hardship to
be elected member of Parliament, and the Mem-
bers were allowed wages, four (hillings a day for
members of counties, and two shillings for others.
âThe cafe, foniehow or other, is ltrangely al
tered now.
ft surely is a desirable thing to be a memberof
Parliament, more to be " den red than gold, yea
tlian much fine gold." One candidate, for a coun
ty not far from Surryâand yet not Surry itfelf,
lias one hundred coaches in pEy,at four pounds pr. day
âand between one thing and another, this gen
tleman is supposed to spend three thousand

At another ele(stion, for a borough, a voter was
imported From France, whither he had retired

with which he returned after the poll, was there

Faille enfant, quide Guise adorait les caprices
iudoot on ignorait les vertus et les vices.
FRANCIS lid, in this year, ij6o, issued a pro
clamation concerning the affairs of the na
tion, and declared that he had resolved to all'em
ble at Kontainbleau,all the Princes and the Nota
bles of his kingdom, in order to take their advice
concerning the urgent neceflities of the state.
He granted to all his fubjetfls full liberty to come
therein person or by deputies, or to lend memo
rials to lay open their grievances, with promifc
to give them a favorable hearing, and to grant
all their requests as far as equity and reason
â¢would permit.
The real intention of the Guises at this time,
was to take vengeance of their rivals : but to
conceal thisdefign under the most profound djf
limulation, until a favorable moment fliould ar
rive, to carry it into execution. A series of re
finement in artifice, was pra&ifed to put off their
the Prince de Conde, the Conitable de
Montmorenci, the Admiral Coligni, and all the
others ot their party : at the fame time that ar
rangements were made in all the Provinces, and
troops were allembled about the court, under
commanders who were in its confidence.
About this time died the Chancellor Olivier,
deitroyed, as was reported, by chagrin at the
cruelties pratftifed at Amboife, and was succeeded
by Michel de L'Hopital, who united to a pro
found erudition, a confum mate experience in bu-
linefs.
To show the universal prevalence of emulation
and rivalry, of jealousy and envy, not only be
tween opposite parties, but among individuals of
the fame party, it is necessary to observe here,
that De L'Hopital, notwithftaiuling his genins,
so penetrating and so fruitful in resources, was
elevated, with great difficulty to this eminent dig
nity by the Queen-mother, in opposition to the
Guises, who infilled long for Louis de Morvilli
eis. Catharine began to dread the too great
elevation of the Guises, and wished to confer this
important office on a fubjed; entirely devoted to
her interests.
At the aflembly of the Notables at Fontain
bleau, were found the chiefs of both parties, ex
cepting the Princes of Bourbon, one of whom,
however, the King of Navarre, sent his secretary
La Sague. After the customary speeches of the
King, Queen, Chancellor, Duke of Guise and
Cardinal de Lorrain, Coligni arose, approached
the King, and presented him a paper, faying that
it was a petition of those of the reformed religi
on, who had inftruified him to pretest it to his
Majesty, founded on the faith of edi&s by which
he had permitted all his fubjedts to lay open their
grievances. He added, that although it was not
fi'gned by any one, yet if his Majesty ihould or
der it, one hundred and fifty thousand men were
ready to fubferibe it. The petition demanded
only liberty of conscience, and to have churches
for public woritaip in the cities. The Cardinal
de Lorrain, with 31l that impetuosity, which,
the natural vehemence of his temper added to
the ardor of his spiritual zeal and temporal am
bition, inspired, called it seditious, insolent, raib,
and heretical : and added, that if to intimidate
the youth of the King, Coligni had advanced that
it would be signed by one hundred and fifty
thousand rebfels, he would be responsible for a
million of good citizens, ready to repress the im
pudence of the fa<ftiouÂ», and compel refpesft to
the royal authority.
As to the differences of religion, those who in
clined to Calvinifui, proposed to demand of the
Pope, a free general council, where they might
dil'cufs and decide by common consent, the mat
ters of controversy : that if the Sovereign Pontiff
Ihould refufe to grant one, the King ought, after
the example offome of his wife predeceflors, to
agetnble a national council. But the Cardinal
of Lorrain,' answered that there was no occasion
for any other council than that which the Pope
had already called at Trent, which had already
reprehended and condemned the dotflrines of the
innovators, opposed to the Romish church.
As to tlie constitution and government of the
state, alter ail infinity of propofirionsand difcuf
lions, fu<rgefted by the variety of interests, Mont
lue or MariJtac, by the secret order of the Queen,
proposed an Aflembly of the States General : and
the two parties, with one voiceconfented. The
Constable, tbe Admiral and their partizans, by
the hope of obtaining a change in the ministry,
the Queen-mother and the Guises, because they
hoped to destroy their rivals. An edicft was ac
cordingly pa fled at Fontainbleau, for holding
the States General, and the lecretaries of state
expedited letters patents to all the Provinces of
the Kingdom, with orders to fend, in the month
ot October, their deputies to Otleans, there to
hold the States General.

FROM THE UNITED STATES CHROSICL t,
Extratt of a letter from a gentleman in Gibraltar to
his friend in America, dated June 16, 179Â°*
Â« 'TnHE Effendi, who is the Prime Minister,
i. kept his [The Emperor of Morocco] death
concealed fevcral days, during which time he
sent the treaJ'ure with aftrongguard to the capi
tal,and dispatched a courier to Mali El-Azed,in
forming him of the death of his father. El-Azed
in an instant ordered himfelf to be proclaimed in
the tomb of Abfolem, Emperor of Morocco,
niÃUiits his herfe, and goes dire<fl for Tetuan, at
which place I was at the time of his arrival.
He was received by every one with open arms,
and declared Emperor in all their places of wor
ftiip. The firft order that he gave was, that eve
ry Jew in that city should be put to death.âThis
was nearly being carried into execution, but a
worthy fellow who had been with him during
his travels requested thai he would fufpeiul his
order, as being contrary to the laws of Mahomet
and God. The new Emperor they ordered every
man, woman and chHd of the Jewifti religion to
be ft ripped naked, their goods, money and pro
perty of every kind to be given to his troops.
This was a&ually done :âand of all the scenes
that ever 1 law, this was the most horrid.âThink
within yourfelf to fee thousands of beautiful wo
men going round the streets in the greatest dis
tress, without a single rag of clothcs upon them.
My rooms were as full of women as they could
How, and Ido declare to you, that every article
of clothes, blankets, sheets, &c. save what I wore,
were appropriated to their use. My pen cannot
describe to you the horrid fuuation they were in,
cut, beat, and abufedby every rascal they came
near. Many hundreds of their women were ra
vished by the black troops. This horrid scene
beinc over, he enquired for the Spanish and En
gl ilh Vice-Con fu'.s. who were both Jews. He or
dered them both to be tied up by their heels,
there to remain until they died. At the request
â¢f the Englilh Admiral, the Englilli Vice-Consul
did not fulFer, but a much better man, the Spa
nish, fuffered as above.
The many cruelties he has committed would be
too much for me to describe, or you to read. He
next proceeded to Tangiers, Sallee, See. but in
place of acting as he had done at Tetuan, he was
advifedto exa<S large fuins of money, which was
done all along as hepafl'ed. He is now created
Emperor all over the Empire. It was generally
thought he wouldmeet withoppofition fromfome
of his brothers, but in place of that wherever he
made his appearance they fled.
New-London, Sept. 8.
IT is recommended to those who put up beef
for a foreign marketâift, That in cutting up
their beef they would use a long lharp knife to
cutthefleih, and a steel plate back saw to cut the
bone, inllead of an ax or cleaver, as the cutting
and sawing leaves the meet fquareend unbruifed,
and fair to the eye *fter salting and packing.
2d. A sure way of putting up beef to remain
good and fit for any market for the lpace ofyears
âApply to of pick'd or mess beef,cut in
4lb. or 61b. pieces, half bushel Liverpool fait, 2
or 3lb. coarfc brown sugar, 40Z. falt-petreâpack
it closeâlet your cask be well hoop'd and pickled.
This has been experienced by a friend this 40
years, who never lolt any so put up.
DIRECTIONS FOR MAKING CIDER.
THE apples after being thrown in a heap
Should always be covered from the weather.
The later the cider is made the better, as the
juices are then more perfectly ripened, and less
danger to be feared from fermentation. No
thing does more harm to cider than a mixture of
rotten apples with the found. The apples ought
to be ground foclofe as to bieak the feeds, which
gives the liquor an agreeable bitter. The pumice
also, ihould be preflcd through hair bags, and
the juice (trained through two sieves, the upper
molt of hair, the lowermost of mullin. After
this the cider ihould be put into open calks,when
great attention is neccflary to discover the exart
time in which the pit take Hill remaining in the
juicc, rises on the topj which happens from the
third to the tenth day, according as the weather
is more or less warm. This body does not re
main upon the top more than two hours ; confc
quently great care should be taken to draw off
the cider before it fink?, which may be done by
means of a plug. When drawn off, the cider is
put into caiks. Particular attention is again re
quired to prevent the fermentation, when the
least inclination towards it is discovered. This
may be done by means of a small quantity of cider
lpirits, about one gallon to the hogshead. In
March the cider Ihould be again drawn off, when
all risk of fermentatidn ceases. Then it fliould
be pur into good sweat calks, and in three years'
from that time is fit for bottling. Old wine calks
are to be preferred ; those which contained rum
are ruinous to cider. Large earthen jars might
be made witlv or without glazing, which would
600
be preferable to any wooden veflels whatever.
Tliis is theEngliih method of making cider, and
when compared with the hasty procel's usual in
America, 110 wonder their cider I'o infinitely ex.
eels ours. Daily Advertiser.
