PHILOSOPHICAL REFLECTIONS
On the late
REVOLUTION IN FRANCE, tc
CONTINUATION.
THUS the splendor of aristocracy was diffYi
fed to the widelt extent in France, waspro
ira<fled through every gradation offociery, and
threw a brilliancy over their domeltic manners
Thefovereign disposed of the whole national re
venue, and disposed of it with the nioltjudici
ous liberality. Tliofe who were incapable of
alfifting theinfelves, âthose who could nolongei
afford the indulgence of falhidnable expence,â
those who difdaiued the luftreof thei.
birth by the fordid acquifuion of commercial
gain,âltill enjuyed every luxury of life, by the
condescending kindness of royal beneficence
A million and a half (almolt the twelfth of the
â whole produtft of national taxation) was graci
ously beltowed, with unbounded generosity, on
a superb and gallant race of nobles. As this
mine of regal munificence was exhauftlefs, Paris
and Versailles were crowded by men offhiuing
accomplishments, who, with passionate anxiety
longed to recommend theinfelves at court. Bur
it was neither by the arrogance of felf-aflumed
merit, nor the revolting pride of parts, that their
hopes were to be realized, and t heir withes gra
tified. Where the fafcinating influence, discri
minating taste, and decisive power of the fairfex
prevailed, their favourites rose to fatne and for
tune, by the acquisition of those artificial etnbel
lilhments, :.nd by that exquisite polish, which the
tad fin of Versailles could alone appreciate. No
envoy was appointed to a foreign court who
could not trace the complicated figure of a ini
nuet with graceful precision. The dignified cre
dentials of an amballador were often granted for
the composition of a chanson aiuoureuf,; and J.
fincer la hurfe avecÂ£Â»ut, or to pollefs the happy
art de ki:n tourner fan compliment, has frequently
tjufesl an officer to the command of an army, ui
a clerk~iiT~oTlicno pi rfiic tj*cr the marine of
Krance. War or peace depended on the charm
ing caprice, on the smile or frown of this en
chanting gynocracy ; and the beaux yieux of the
reigning Sultana often set the wot Id in ablaze.
The laucy indiscretion of ill-bred authors was
likewise inftajitly corrected, and an inllruc r tive
hint conveyed to them in the polite style of a
lettre de cachet.ââº Diderot was treated with this
.flattering mark of attention by Madame de Pom
padour, andfent to apartments provided for him
ty the King at Viuccirnei, for presuming to criti
cife the composition and execution of a favorite
court fiddler, without being hiinfelf a connoifieur
in music. Roufl'eau, with his accullomed mifan
thiopy, presented a memoirc, soliciting the in
largement of his friend, or requesting to share
his prison. Both these favours were, with g eat
propriety, relufed him ; yet he ungratefully ex
ercifed his cynical declamation, on not being in
dulged in either alternative.
But, alas ! the whole of this sublime and beau
tiful system is deranged. The very dregs of the
people have fatally discovered that nobles, prin
ces, and even kings, are formed of the fame clay
â with themselves, and owe their elevation and
grandeur only to the accidental circumstances of
birth and fortune. It has been well observed,
that tru h {hould not be told at all times ; and
surely a truth of this dangerous tendency fliould
ever be concealed frointhe vulgar , forcontempi
often begins with them when admiration ceases.
They were happy and contented when they look
ed up to the great ones of the earth, as beings of
a superior order ; but the pleafingdelufion from
whence they enjoyed fomuch felicity will quick
]y vanish ; the transient splendor of a terrelb ial
meteor would no longer excite their wonder and
astonishment, if they did not trace iw origin to
thelieavens, and iniftake it for a falling star.
I am confirmed inthejuftice ofthefe fantiments
by the philosophical obfervationsof Mr. Necker,
y/ho describes, with fympatheiic delight, the
happineft of the French peasantry beforethe late
..political revolution. " They behold," fays he,
â¢' tlie oftentati6us display of ranks with the cool
eft indifference ; grandeur isfo remote from theii
habitual ideas, that they accustom themselves to
look upon it as the attribute of a tew beings of a
fpeciesdifferent from their's ; and as they retuin
liome to their cottages, under the preflure of a
burthen they can scarcely bear, they feethofe
fiery couriers, who rapidly whirl the magnificent
chariots of the rich and noble, close by theui,and

view them with thefame indifference as they con
euipldte those wandering planets over their heads
whole twinkling motion they just discern." But
his t>eautiful Arcadian landscape will quickly
vanifli ; the serenity of rheir prelent enjoyments
â vill speedily be djfturbed ; their political con-
Sequence in elections will excite new and afpir
mg ideas, and foou transform this humble, con
reutcd,-fubmillive peasantry, into a bold, turbu
lent, factious yeor.ranry ; magnificent 6ha
riois and fiery couriers vfjll ltop at their doors,
ind the rich and great will condescendingly
alight to solicit their votes ; they will be tempc
ed, by long leases and low rents, to lead a life of
cat e, anxie.j and labor, in the cultivation of
, their farms. The taif/e, that excellent tax, so
admirably calculated to maintain the splendor
and dignity of the noblefle, and keep their tenan
try in a comfortable state of degradation, will be
aboliihed for ever. They will spurn their vege
table meal, and insolently, perhaps, afpirc to re
alize the unkingly wish of Henri quatr.-, whose
llatue is still contempruoufly exhibited on the
Pont Ntuf, as a monument of his folly :â" That
he hoped to fee the time when every peasant in
France should eat flelhmeat once a day, and have
a boiled fowl for his Sunday's dinner."
The more I confiderthis important fubje<Jt, the
-political evils thai menace our country, from the
fatal revolution in France, become moie appar
ent. I ifaall adduce oneft. iking iuitance by which
our revenue and manufactures may be ruined.
The commutation ast is now a favorite one, as it
fairly and impartially compels evtfry man to pay
an additional window tax, in order to reduce the
price of tea : Ifhedoesi.ot choose to drink it,
lie has no reason to complain, as it is his own
fault. Perhaps it will be fuggcfled at some mo
ment of popular phrenzy, that the commutation
nc r t is a badge offlavery ; for when this uieafure
was firft proposed, it was compared in debate to
the gab.lls, a funilar fort of impost on fait, which
long prevailed in Franca, aud has lately
aboliihed by the National Afleinbly. Mr. Kox,
tho he owned the justness of the remark, fac
tiouily preferred the mild spirit of French taxa
tion ; aflerting, " that there was 110 degree of
comparison, 011 the plea of neceflicy, between the
use of fait and tea.â The latter was clearly a lux
ory, and no ways conducive to health; perhaps
far otherwise, as many had thought. Salt, on the
contrary, was a necellary ; and therefore it was
farlefs oppreflive to oblige the I'ubjecfts of France
10 purchase as much fait as it wasluppofeda per
son of any given description in life would have
occasion for." These words may be malicioully
repeated, to excite ieditioa and difloyahy in the
minds of the people, and induce them to insist 011
the repeal of a most equitable and impartial tax.
What inuft be the consequence ? The flourifhing
state of the Ealt-India Company would no longer
excite Mr Crawfuid's admiration ; bankruptcy
mult ensue ; publiccredit would be Ihaken ; the
rapid reduction of the national debt would cease,
and we should no longer be charmed by the ac
curacy of calculation and elegance of composition
Co eminently aifplayed in that annual oration,
(the India budget) which shews forth the merit,
and celebrates the praise, of the President and
Members of ilie Board of Control.
The dangerous proximity of the two countries
also uiakes ine tremble.âOur manufactures, on
any wife judicious exteniion of the excise laws,
tempted ro migrate to France, instead of doubling
their industry and ftarpening their ingenuity
here, both to pay the rax and evade the lafcr. Now
as our experienced and eiilighteped minilters
have candidly declared, that all our future resour
ces of revenue, all our hopes of a permanent
flourifhing finance, inuft be derived from an ex
tension ofour excise laws, and their application
to our manufactures, we majr be reduced to the
melancholy alternative of choosing either to be
ruined by enforcing, or abandoning, thisfalutary
fyllem. The threats and audacious conduit of
the tobacconists at thismomenr, implicitly direct
ed by the factious advice jf an able, active, and
dangerous leader in the lioufe of commons, fuf
ni(h too lamentable a proof t>f the facility with
which our fraudulent smuggling traders (moftof
whom are diflenters) may be induced to spurn
at the laws of their country, elude the wisdom
of its arts ; and, with unparalleled impudence,
to combat and oppose the opinion both of the
minister ajid his lecretary.

THE eloquence and authority of Coligni, pre
vailed with the others to embrace the par
ty of the Calvinifts,to whose do&rines,were fecret
]y devoted (everal of the noblemen then present in
the afleinbly. The common voice was in favor of

time, the view ot dangers, to which theinoft de

J
After Martin Luther bad introduced into Ger
many, the liberty of thinking in matters of reli
gion, and erected the standard of reformation ;
John Calvin, a native of Noyon, in Picardy, of
a vast genius, Angular eloquence, various erudi
tion and poliflied taste, embraced the cause of
reformation. In the books which he publilhed,
and in the discourses which he held, in several
cities of France, he proposed one hundred and
twenty eight articles, in opposition to the Creed
of the Roman Catholic Church. These opinions
were soon embraced with ardor and maintained
with obliinacy, by a great number of persons ot
all conditions. The asylum and the center of
this new fedt, wasGensva, a city situated on the
lake anciently called Lamanus, on the frontiers
of Savoy, which had (haken off the yoke of its
Biftiops and the Dukes ot Savoy, and erecfled it
(slf into a republic, under the title ofa free city,
for the fake of liberty of conscience. From this
city proceeded printed books, and men distin
guished for their wit and eloquence, whofpread
ing themselves in the neighbouring provinces,
â¢there sowed in secret the feeds of their docftrinc.
Almost all the cities and provinces of France be
gan to be enlightened by it. It began to intro
duce itfelf into the kingdom, under Francis 1(1.
in opposition to all the vigorous resolutions which
lie took to suppress it. Henry lid. ordained,
with inexorable severity, the punishment ofdeath
again It all who should be convidledof Calvinism.
The Cardinal of I.orrain, was the high prielt,and
the proud tyTaflt, who counselled and Simulated
the King, to those cruelties and persecutions,
which, by (bedding the blood of all the advocates
of civil liberty, might have wholly fupprefled it,
if the unexpected death of Henry lid. which the
Calvinifts regarded as a miracle wrought in their
favor, had not occasioned some relaxation under
Francis I Id. The Duke of Guise and the Cardi
nal of Lorrain, persisted in their bloody perfe
cnting resolutions : but they did not find in the
Parliament, nor in the other magistrates, the
fame promptitude to execute the orders which
they gave in the name of the King.
Theodore Beza, a disciple of Calvin,celebrated
for hi&eloquence and erudition, had already con
verted several persons of both sexes, and of the
firft nubility of the kingdom : and it was no lon
ger in (tables and cellars that the Calvinifts held
their aflemblies, and preached their sermons, but
in the houses ofgentlemen, and in the palaces of
the great. The people called them Huguenots,
or Aignoflen Confederates. The Admiral Colig
jii and several other noblemen, had indeed em
braced the newdo<ftrine as it was called : but the
Calvinifts, restrained by the fear of punishment,
itill held their aflemblies in secret, and the great
dared not declare openly for them.
The Bourbons, finding France in a condition
so favorable to their present interests, embraced
greedily the proposition of Coligni, and they de
puted Dandelot and the Vidsme de Chartres to
negotiate this affair with the Calvinifts. These
able agents, who had both embraced Calvinism,
easily found a multitude of persons disposed to
communicate to others the projedt in contempla
tion, and to make the necefliry preparations for
its execution. The Critrlnifts agitated without
interruption by the terror of dangers and puni(h
ments, served them with so much promptitude
and concert, that they placed things in a train, in

LONDON, June 21.
The preparations made in Sweden for keeping
a fleet in conitant readiness for sea, exceed those
of any other country in Europe. At Carlelcroon
they have begun to hew out of the solid rock
thirty docks, in which twenty fail of the line
and thirty frigates will be entirely rei'cued from
the weather, while their itores and ammunition
remain in galleries, between each dock, in such
readiness, that they inay be conveyed on board
in 24 hours.

tempted to part with your securities much below their true value,
and coiilidciably below what it. is probable they will fell for in
eight or nine monthsjrom this time.
I o guardypu agamft an unnccelTary facrifice of your interest,
by a precipitate sale, I willnow.ftateto you, in a plain and con
cile way, what has been done for you to the course of the lad fci
lion ol Congress, and what you may reasonably expect.
Kffectual provision hos been made for aiiually paying you
fix per ccnt. yearly, on two thirds of the principal of your djbt,
that is, 4 per cent, on the whole amount of your principal. And
at the end of ten years you are to receive fix per cent, yearly
on the remaining third of your principal, that is, two per ccnt.
more on the whole of your principal. And like effeSUal piov -

on whatever arrears of inte-eft may be due to you 011 vour princi

to lay, one fourth part at the end of every three months â¢ and ,t

have been laid on goods imported, and on the tonnage offhips or

To dclfroy your confidence in future, there are too many publi

proceedings, violated their pad engagements, and that you can
ptace no greater reliance upon those they now make than those
they have heretofore made. Whether reprefentauons like tilefe
proceed from a sincere opinion in pcrfons, who have not accurate
ly conhdered the matter, or from thole who wish to depreciate
the government, or from those who with to buy securities cheap,
or from all thele defcnptions of pcrfons, I cannot fay ; but from
whatever source they proceed they are certainly not candid nor
Congress it is true submit to your consideration forae alterations
in t e nature of your claims upon the govcrnmeut, for certain
quivalents, which they hold out to you, mid of which you arc to

THE PRESIDENTS DEPARTURE.
On Saturday last his Excellency the Governor
and the Mayor and Aldermen of the city, dined
with the President of the United StatesâThe
"relident informed the gentlemen of his inten
tion to viflc Mount Vernonâand that he ffiould
leave the city on the Monday following-he ex
preiled the deep sense he had of the refpedful
a;tention which the corporation in particular
and the citizens in general had fhewrii him per
-1011 ally, and as firft mngiflrate of the United
States and added that it was with the utniofl
regret that he ffiould quit a residence which
had been rendered so agreeable to him Mrs.
Washington appeared greatly aftecfted on the
occauon.
On Monday at ten o'clock 4. M. the President
of the United States, his Lady and : kite depart
ed from this city they embarked a: Mr.
Mc'Combs wharf in the President's barce and
eroded the north river to Powles' Hookât;ie Go
vernorâthe Chief Justice and executive officers'
of the United Statesâthe corporation ofthe city
âgentlemen of the clergyâthe officers ofthe
militiaâand a number of other refpeiftable citi
zens attended by the ffieriff, marffials and con
ltaoles accompanied the President to the place of
embarkationâwhere they took a solemn and af
lecting adieu. The Governor, the Chief Jus
tice, the Secretary at War, and Secretary of the
1 reafury embarked with the President. The
CuiVom house barge, in which was a number
of the officers of the cultoms, accompanied the
President's barge to Powles' Hook.
At the moment of embarkation a federal salute
was fired from the battery.
By the particular reque'ft of the President, the
gentlemen of the corporation had not given pub
lic notice of his intended departure on Monday;
which prevented so general an attendance of the
citizens as would have been desirous of pajinc
him their refpecls 011 this intererting occasion.

D iati on the amendment of the Sinate to the Fund
' ing Bill, to afume a part of the State Deots.
Mr. GERRY.
(Concluded.) |
r T" , HE gentleman, fa}S the apportionment " P a " la '' a " d
1 fofollyoi this opinion, as it lelates to Mairachufctls, tha
nothing hut a convifftioo of ,he necelGty oT closing with tlic lc
inthisinftaiice, to prevent the loss of the landing bill could re
eoncile me to .'he measure. Ue appears to prefer an
ot the whole, to that of a pa. tot the debts, and I g
liihi in this likevsr.fe, so far a. that, after passing tht. b;U, i_Â» V'Â»-
pofuion should be made for assuming the residue of the debts, it
lhall have my hearty alfent. L , _ Ham-nrk
The gentleman has mentioned a speech of Governor llincock,
as holding op the idea that the debts of the bute, could not be
.illumed without their â¢ xprefs authority. The *Pf *'
may admit of this couftruft.on, but .t is expressed in such en g
tnatica) terms us to admit of a diflerent meaning. Whether the
Governor wilhcd to reftrve his opinion, or what were hlÂ» inter.-
lions by the paragraph of his fpcechalluded to, ami u
determine ; but the fenfeof the leg.Cature of the Statt ' Â«P^
on the occ.fion ; they did not think it neceffa.y to author,ft their
members in Cougiefno assume, but lnftrufted them to urge the
assumption; being fully convinced, as I think every one must
be who has attended to the constitution, that Congrcfs have com
petent powers lor this purpofe-The gentleman tells us of ind vi
dua! States and individuals who are in favor of the assumption .
but however interested they may be, they have discovered no felf- |
rih Views, lor they win. nol, as some who are
other part of the domettic debt, to engrofsthe whole ot the funds
hi-, payment of their particular demands, and only urge an equal
application iÂ»l the revenue to pay the just demands o every ci
dttor. The gentleman would have preft.rtd the affamption at an
early lather than at the present period, and before anv State had
taxed for its debt ; but I confefs 1 am of a different opinion, for
then thefum to be assumed would have been fixty-f-ve or fcventy
millions of d 011..., and this would have fofwclled thepubl.c
debt as to have put the inattei in a different light, and wo
doubtedlv have deterred many who are now lor it from voting
for the assumption : whereas the reduaton of the debt has made
the measure feafible and proper. The gentleman tells us, Geor
gia after having been taxed agreeably to requisitions and to repre
fefttation, will be now trebly taxed. This to me is unintelligi
ble, lor in .he reouifuions Ihe ha. generally been exempted, with
a provilion that fhc (hall hereafter pay her proportion, and Ihe
has contributed little or nothing in this modeâas to her contribu
tions bv thciatio of reprefcntation, there has been no direit fe
deral wx, and Ihe has paid nothing 111 this way, (he can therefore
betax' d but once for any balance that may be due Irom hei.
It is fa id the federal convention having reiefied the proportion
for affunnog debts, the power ought not to be excrcifed by Con
grcfs ; but so far was the convention from doing this, that there
was .to 07.pof1t.or. to the metfure. It wa. ur-Â«l by | -
members, and 1 confefs myfelf to be ol the number, that at the
fame time the debts were a.Tuined p' ovifion should be made lor
those States who had exerted themfelvcs to fink their debts, and
it was obl'eivcd bv the gentleman from Conncfhcut (Mr. Sherman)
that as the constitution gave fufficient power to Congrels to al
(ume the debts, they undoubtedly would assume them, and make
the other provilion mentioned. He thought it eligible therefore to
icftr the whole matter to Congfefs, and his proportion met the
approbation of the convention. 1 think these arc the a s, an
i.rat they favor the alfumption. ,
The gentleman supposes some Stateshave not been critical in ad
lutting their accounts. Some of the States have been remarkably
careful on this head, and sure I am that no State could be more so
than Maffachuf.tts. She has not to my knowledge 111 any Â»Â»Â«Â»"Â«Â«
been p.ofufe, and in many cafe, has curtailed the reasonable de
mauds of h. r citizens against the union. The gentleman ("Â«< he
houle have abandoned the exeife, but nolhirtg has been done that
will iuftify the assertion ; on the other hand the noufe refuted
to expunge from the revenue bill what related to the exeife and
this wear* the appearance of their having adopted it. c i
indeed wasafterwatds rtjeftcd, and every member who voted Â»-
~,1,(1 it can best determine the pnnciple of his vote, but I believe
a was not in general the result of an objection to this mode of
.ailingrevenue ; neither do I think with the gentleman that the
mcmbcis who are in favor ot the exeife like the long parliament,
disavow ill public what they follcr in private : for they have o
pcnly avowed their principles and brought forward their argu
ments to support them. .... , . ...
The gentleman has mentioned a consolidation of the union as
the result of the assumption, and supposes the, authority of the
Siate governments will be thus destroyed ; he has also f.nd that
the friends to the Slate governments will bÂ« loft. My attachment
to the State governments will probably not be doubted, and yet
to support them, I consider the assumption as a neceilary mea
fhre. The federal government has a power paramount to the
Mates, to lav aud collet! imports, excises, and direct and
probSbly will ntver be deprived of that power : mould it be aU
lniniftcred, as I have no doubt it will, in each ot thefc modes,
tiie ailumpnon will secure an application of the revenue to the
payn.mt of the State dents ; and 11 cannot be so easily misapplied
and squandered as it would be without such an application. And
it is not, evident, as was formerly urged, that if the debts are to
be funk by the States, they will'be in the danger the gentleman
menutvns ? Should the Slates lay taxes for this purpose, thelc will
be so heavy, as to make the State governments unpopular, and
the dcltruÂ£tion of their constitutions may thereby be produced ;
âr if, 011 the other hand, no adequate provifiou should be made,
they will be considered as unjust, hnd the people contrasting the
Mate governments with the federal government, will prefer the
latter for its regard to public juiticc; and will consider the tor
mer as a public grievance and abolish them.
The gentleman fays, when Congress in 1783, required an im
post, it was undcrftood that every State should puy her own
debts, that Georgia had done what it could, and ought not to pay
an iota more. This is a newdo&rine, and is contrary to the ex
press stipulations of all the requisitions ot Congrats, of which I
think there are between twenty and thirty. He likewile fuppo
ied Georgia will pay 1-22 of the debts of the States ; whereas they
are to be apportioned according to the next cenhu by which she
will not probably p;iy more than the 50th part thereof. He also
speaks of the sum alTumed tor Pennsylvania, and of a bargain with
that State ; but if the gentleman refers to the residence bill, he
cannot suppose that the States iÂ» favor of the assumption, made
such a bargain. For such was their oppofuion to the measure, as
-give offence to the members of that State ; and as to her debt
it is not all included in her fpecified claim. Because as (he had
ylledgedj there was not time for ftatin 5 it. Indeed, as the has
assumed of the continental debt, 5 million dollars, and must
give upjhe continental certificates for which her St " e ftc " r
lereiffued, before these can be funded, Â»PPÂ«* ob.
ieftion. of the gentleman we unfounded The h " fu| }"
Used that many cithern of the States who have ,nftr U aed to Â»-,
fume, are ag,Â«.(l the measure. But the reverse of this .. P'^able,
that i great number of the citUen. of States whose member, op
pose it. are in favor of the alTumption. f .
It has on a former occasion been urgrd, that the accounts of the
State, (hould be fettled before payment, are made thereon; and
have not the accounts to be assumed been long nnce fettled,
The balance, been ascertained that are due to the State creditors?
The debts to be assumed are generally debts da-from the un
,o individu.U which have been adjuftjd according to authent c
documents issued by officer, of Congress; but if the debt were
aflually due to the Statesâis there any rea.on that the creditor
States seven years after the war should be longer prevented trom
receiving their balances, under the pretext that their accounts
must firft be liquidated ? How would such conduct appear in pri
vate life 1 Suppufe a creditor, wjio eight or ten years pall had sup
plied large sums, was, upon application for payment, toldl' by the
debtor that the accounts were not liquidated, and lie would there
fore pay no part thereof, although it was evident he might do
this without a risque of exceeding the balance owÂ«d, would he
ever after obtain credit t Would he not destroy all confidence in
hi. probity ? Surely,he would, and such a line of condua can no
more be iullifiedin public than in private life. .
But, fir, notwithllanding I am tor doling with the Senate in I
this propofuion with tome amendment, yet the apportionment or
tbe lontÂ»obeairÂ»rtdJ,'Â«iÂ»d manv parts of the bill are siÂ» extreme,
lv obieQionable as to gain my alfent upon no other principle than
that of accommodation ; with this view I lhall endeavor to pe re
conciled to the bill: but I conlefs it is an attempt to swallow a
political porcupine, and neceflity alone can juftity the meaiure;
for I despair >t present of obtaininga better provision for the pub
lic creditors. Bui (hould we not be able to accommodate the
billâJhould it be loft or pnftponed to another Congrefs,or lellion,
what will be the result f The government will be brought into
contemptâthe States will be in danger of a convulsionâthe reve
nue will probabl) be impaired or loft* and citizens attached to
: you will no longer be able to support your administration. For
1 these and other reasons that may be offeied I hope wÂ« lhall reject
' the propofuion for disagreeing to the amendments proposed by
the Senate.
THE TABLET. No. 141.
" Men are of nothing so liberal as of their advice."
IF it be asked why men are so free in giving
away advice, it may be answered, because
it is generally of very little value. It colls the
giver nothing, and it is seldom worth any thing
to the receiver, lnllrucftion 1 take to be different
from advice. Were 1 difpoled to acquire a know
ledge in music, or any mechanical art, Ifliould,
liktTa prudent man, apply to some person lkilled
in the matter 1 wiflied to learn, to be my instruc
tor. Profeflional men ilionld be supposed better
acquainted with the Icience of their profeffion,
tl.an rhofe whose pursuits are different.
Information is likewise a different thing from
advice. A man, who has travelled a road 1 have
nor, can inform me what accommodations he met
with, and give me such an idea of the country as
CÂ£>ulxl never b - ufitainei! kji analogy w ictiijc'-"-
ture. All I fliould ask of him is information
about his difcovcries. But whether I fliall travel
that road or not, no person (hould determine but
myfelf. Every man who does not diredt his own
rteps, will have them badlyâ  directed. It is very
usual for men to solicit advice with refpetfi to any
obje>ft of hulinefs, and even with refpeÂ«sfc to a ge
neral plan of business. But there seldom results
any good from following such advice. The va
rious contingencies which attend the affairs of
every individual, and which can be known, or
which perhaps ought to be known only to him
felf, make it expedient that every person (honld
be the keeper of his own secrets, and the manag
er of his own concerns. Those who have so lit
tle sagacity as to need advice, will, in moll in
stances, have too little judgment to determine
whether what is given them, be proper. That
knowledge which is most beneficial, is the result
of experience. If 1 look to a friend for directi
on about my affairs, he must predicate his advice
not on any experience which is peculiarly appli
cable to my cafe, and therefore I had better do
without it. 1 may ask him for fatfts ; 1 may alk
him to recite instances of his own experience, but
I inuft myfelf judge whether my situation be simi
lar to his, and if I have discernment enough to
tell whether his conduit be a model for my own,
1 have likewise enousrh to a<si without fuchatno
del.
It furnifhes a strong argument against the be
nefit of general advice, that our friends alk no
compensation fbr it. A lawyer demands a re
compense for all the counsel he profeflionally
gives, andfodoesaphyfician. Yet either of them
will pretend they take a pleasure in giving ad
vice gratis, that is out of the line of their pro
fefiion. Their alking nothing for it, is a pretty
good proof, that ic is worth nothing. It will ge
nerally hold good, that men prosper best, when
they are left to their own discretion in managing
their own affairs. The reason is obvious. No
man can so completely state his cafe to another
person, as to give him a perfect idea of all the
circuniftances. Some material point will be
omitted. An acquaintance of mine, who was a
lawyer, complained to one of his friends that he
got little buiinefs in his profelfion : fays the other
to him, lay afidc the practice of the law, and en
gage in commercial affairs. The lawyer follow
ed his advice, and soon involved himfelf in debt,
which proved his ruin. The truth is, he was too
indolent and careless to beeome an eminent law
yer, and could just make out to gain afubfillence.
But when hearted according to the advice of his
580
friend, turned merchant, lie found the want of
industry and carc did fomerhing worse than pre
vent his acquiring honor and profit. His friend,
however, not knowing he was lazy and heedless,
was unqualified to advise better than he did.
Innumerable instances may be produced equally
to thepurpofe, and such as will authorize aeon,
clufion, that unless a peiTon depends on his own
judgemnt for the general management of his af
fairs, he runs a risque that they will never be
| well managed.
