correspondence between the prefiderit of the sy
nod and the Marqnif del C , I hear, will be
publiftied by Do<ftorH, as an appendix to his next:
addition of " A Review of the Cale."
Mow; Sir, permit me to ask you a plain ques
tion : Does not the church let an example to the?
diflenters how they should conduit themselves
on cafuiftica! difficulties ? Is it not perfedtly un
derstood, that numbers of the clergy ardently
wifti to be relieved from fubfeription. to the thir
ty-nine articles, and foine years ago stated their
reasons, with great force and precision, in a pe*
ticion to the house of commons Yet as the legi
slature did not think proper to comply with their
requcft, they submit patiently, and consider the.
coercion of the subsisting law as an ample juftifi
cation for their involuntary acquiescence. Tliey
conceive obedience, and holding,their living, to
be their priipary inclifpenfableduty, even on the
tenure of fubfeription to articles which they do
not believe. Yet theyftill maintain their confci.
entious objections in theory, and exhibit a lau
dable ingenuity, by reconcilingunfullied princi
ple with worldly \wifdoin.
Oaths are taken, and their obligation examined by them, with
the fame candor and fcbcrality, on the incontrovertible maxima
of moral and political philosophy, Co ably illustrated by Arch
deacon Palcy, who ftuewdly tÂ»bfervs, u that members of Colle
ges, and other ancient foundations, are full required to swear to
the oblervance of their refpe&ivc statutes ; which observance :s
become in some cases unlawful, in others impYatticahUi in others
ujelefiy in others inconvenient.** But, if the ast you fwcar to per
form be absurd and impratticable, you are, ipfo JaEla. abfoived at
the moment you take it. So, if the cause for prescribing the oatft
originally no longer exiils, you are equally akfolvcd, as the effetfc
neceirarily ceases with the cause. If the fpccific aÂ£ts enjoined arc
impra&icablc or absurd, you virtually and truly comply with the
genuine spirit of the oath, as far as you pollibly can ; which is the
utmost you could do, evco if ycu ftriflly arul literally fulfilled
tbev were neither absurd or impracti
cable. It may be iiivi4ioufly tfketi, then, is the utility of
such a solemn appeal to heaven ? Aod whether it would not bÂ«
better either to form pra&icible oaths, or dispense with impra&j*
cable ones? My conllant answer isâthe danger to be aporehen
ded from any innovation. Bcfides, one principal use of an
univerfit) education would be loft; which is, to inspire our in
genious youth with a due veneration for the reverend founders of
colleges, who framed both the statute and the oath. By this
students are also early acquainted with the refinement*
of logic, and the fubtilty of moral diflin&ions, and rendered Jcfs
scrupulous on trivial points, which might otherwise impede their
progreflive fortunes m life.
Thus, Sir, animated with the raoft ardent zeal for the pros per
ity and glory of Britain, I have exerted my utmofl efforts to in
spire my countrymen with a true spirit of obedience, fubmiHion,
and loyalty. The church is in danger ; the conflitution is mena
ced ; a puritanical iavagenefs of manners spreads among the peo
ple; the desponding seriousness of fanaticifm has contaminated
their hearts and infefled the land, Athcifm and democracy have
formed a new family-compact, and this new and formidable alli
ance will be our ruin : I fee nothing but clouds and darkness in
the air; for despotism has alraoft finifhed his splendid course, and.
scarce emits one refrsftcd ray, to cheer the impending gloom,
and prolong the twilight of his reign.
Liberty, as every true Englifliman knows, can only appear
" profufe of blik and pregnant withdelight," when seated on her
throne, with the crown and mitre in conjun&ion, on her head,
adorned in the sumptuous robes of the peerage, with the ted ast
in one hand, and the excise laws in the other. You will tell me,
perhaps, with republican enthusiasm, that you can admire her
dressed up in rustic simplicity, amidst the bleak mountains of
Switzerland, by a hardy peasantry ot soldiers, ferti
lizing the rocks, and turning the very (tones into bread. You
will tell me, that you can admireher in naked roving amidfk
the boundless forefts of America, diffufing her own spirit of at
traction through distant regions, and uniting them by its divine
energy ; where confcicnce is not shackled b/ bigotry ; where to
leration is profenbed, as only implying a suspension of petfrcu
tion ; where obedience to the laws is the test of allcgience, and
the virtue of the man does not stigmatize the citizcn. You wiU
tell me, that you can admire this favorite goddess of vour's, where
flic reduces all ranks, and levels all invidious diftinftions, by re-Â«
ftorin r man to his natural equality, dignified alone by those fuper
lor talents bellowed on him by the Divinity ; where all the bril
liant traits of the human mind, unsubdued by the uniform glare
and wide effulgence of monaichy, are displayed in their true aud
original colors.
I know you will tell me, that your eye it not microscopic enough
to discern the minute spots in the fun of liberty that has lately
r'jen in France ; which has deigned to revisit the deserted shore
otCorfiea, and, in its glorious progress, has illumined the whole
political atmosphere of Europe.
But, Sir, I fit down contented, and (hall enjoy theconfcious fa
tistadlion ot having performed my duty. I have painted the ca
lamities of France ; I have forewarned Britain of her danger.-.-
The sceptre trembles in the hands of kings ; the (lability of every
throne is lhaken, by the late political convulsion; the (hock is not
confined to France ; it afls like " the electrical returning ftroke,i
which often produces fatal effects at a vafl distance from the place
where the lighting falls."
I hope. Sir, you will cxrufe the freedom with which I haro
t 'US publicly addressed you, and be prrfuaded, that I can admite;

THE Prince of Conde, whofecretly lighted UP
this conflagration, advanced by moderate
tlays journeys to court. He wiflied to be witness
ot the event, and to take suddenly, according to
circumitances, the part which ihould appear to
him the inoft advantageous. The Admiral, al
ways circumfpedt, feigned to remain neuter.
He retired to his estate at Cliatillon, under the
pretext of enjoying the fweCts of private life,
without meddling with affairs of the public, or of j
government ; but in reality it was as much to
aid the conspiracy, by his councils and informa
tion, as to avoid the accidents which might de
feat ail enterprize which he judged rafhand dan
gerous. The conspirators, who were not agitat
ed with similar anxieties, but full of the moll
flattering hopes, had begun their march infecre
cy, carrying their arms concealed under their
cloarhs. Thoy advanced separately by different
roads, and in the order which had been markecf
out by their chiefs, towards Blois, where the
court resided at that time. This city was open
011 all fides, and without fortifications, and the
conspirators were to meet in its suburbs, on the
fifteenth day of March, i j6o.
But whatever might be the activity of their
proceedings and the iecrecy of their councils,
tliey could not efcapÂ© the penetration of the
Guises. The favors, penlions and employments
they confered, and their great reputation, had
attached to them so many creatures in the dif
ferent provinces of the kingdom, that they were
punctually informed of all the movements of the
conspirators. It was indeed impollible that the
inarch of so numerous a multitude could remain
unknown, when conspiracies whose lecrets are
confined to a final] number ofperlbns, ofthemolk
consummate discretion and fidelity, are aluioft
always discovered before theit execution. Whe
ther the secret was discovered by La llenaudie, or
Avenelles, or discovered by the spies employed
by the miniltry, even in the houses of the princi
pal conspirators, or whether information of it
came from Germany : as soon as the Guises had
received.it, they deliberated 011 the means of
defeating it.
The Cardinal of Lorrain, who was no soldier,
advised to atfeinble the nobility of the nearelt
provinces, to draw from the neighbouring cities
all the garrisons to form a body of troops, and
tofendordeis to ail the commandants and go
vernors to take the field, and put to the fworu,
all the men whom they should find in arms* He
prefutned that the conspirators, perceiving them,
selves to be discovered, and informed of the inea
fures taken against them, and which fame would
not fail to exaggerate, would dissipate of them
selves. The duke of Guise, more familiar with
danger, and despising the transports of a multi
tude, wichotit discipline or order, regarded the
advice of the Cardinal, as more proper to palli
ate the dillemper, than to cure it ; adding that
since it was so pernicious, and had infirtuated it
lelf into the heart of the kingdom, it was useless
to temporize, and give it opportunity to break
out with more violence. He thought it there
fore, more prudent to diflemble, and affect igno
rance.of the enterprize, to draw in the conspira
tors, and give them time to discover themselves ;
that in such a cafe, their defeat and punishment
would deliver France from a fatal contagion,
â which, as it discovered itfelf by symptoms so ter
rible, demanded violent remedies, and not sim
ple lenitives. He added, that in punishing sepa
rately only a part of the conspirators, they lhould
furniih matter to the ill intentioned, to calumni
ate the authors of this severity ; that the people,
little accustomed to such infurrertions, would re
gard this as a chimera, and as a table, invented
by the ministry to crufli tlieir enemies, and eita
blilh their own power and authority r whereas,
by overwhelming all the conspirators at once,
when upon the point of execution, they ftiould
dissipate all Calfe accusations, and jultify in the
fight of all the world, the rectitude and the lin
ceriry of the intentions of thole who were at the
Lead of affairs.
Catharine agreed with the duke. No extraor
dinary preparation was made, which could ex
cite a iufpicion that the conspiracy was known.
They duly removed the King and the court to
Amboifi ten leagues from Blots. This castle, situ
ated on the Loire, and in the inidit of forefts
which fortify it, naturally, appeared to be a laser
asylum : as it was easy to place in security the
King and the two Queens, in the castle, while a
small 'number of troops fliould defend the en
trance of the village, which was of difficult access.

CURIOSITY is so active a spring of the loul,
that it can never be gratified by the contem
plation only of such things as have a real exiit
ence. It hurries the imagination through ail the
unknown regions ofjpace, in search of new and
extraordinary Â£.une, and conftituies darkness lt
felf, as the rclidence of a vast ot marvel
ous'beings. The magic delufiojis ot the fancj
have yieldedthe highest pleasure to men of ge
nius, and made them look with disdain on ordi
nary characters and occurrences. Perhaps no
problem better deserves afolution, than why men
of the malt sublime understandings, ihould so
often miitake the wildeftchimerasfor important
realities. A man of a vigorous genius is liable,
with all others, to imbibe errors and prejudices
in education. When these are carried into â¢Ma
ture age, in foite of reason and reflexion, it is
obvious thcii irfetfts will be eonfpicuouS' in pro-j
portion to thy U<ut h&sc&c
riflxed tfaem. Â«Ve accordingly find that men of
tlje most celebrated talents, have alio been diflin
guifhed for the most remarkable whims and An
gularities of opinion. There are so many sour
ces of deception to which we are exposed in edu
cation, that it is iinpoffible to guard the undfcr
ftanding against afl'ociating ideas which have no
natural connection. Fables and stories of leger
demain are put into the bands of children to sti
mulate their curiolity to read, and before instruc
tors are awareof it, the tender mind fofters a
thousand falfe conceptions, which perhaps are
never afterwards eradicated.
It will here naturally be enquired, whether
tlie productions of fancy are luitable ro be pre
sented to a mind before it is capable of looking
into the nature of what it conreniplates. The
imagination of every person creates a world of
its own, which is not only widely different from
the atftual state of things, but oppoiiie likewise
to the fictions which other people conceive. By
this departure from truth, men are not only at
variance with nature, but with one another.
I cannot suppose that falfliood ever allumes a
Jhape that can give it an eligible character. Nor
do I believe a youth can be indulged in imposing
on his own credulity, without exposing him to a
real inconvenience. The inind cannot be too
soon or too cotoftantly habituated to view things
as they really are. It is frequently suggested as
an excuse for allowing young people to imbibe
erroneous ideas, that when they are more ad
vanced in agtf, tbey will discern their errors and
eaii correct them. But there is something fofaf
cinating to the young mind in the charms of po
etry, and even in the rhapsodies of enthusiasm,
that it becomes a painful felf-denial todifmilsthe
errors that have entered through thole alluring
channels. There can be no effectual security
against the delusions of falfliood and error, but
by never fufferitig the inind to contract an habit
of viewing objects otherwise than their real cha
racter deserves. If we take a pleasure in read
ing the fictions of a poem or a novel, let us be
told, they are no more than a fiction. If the
images delineated be contrary to nature, or drawn
in too glowing colors, let the deception be ex
poled, that our ideas may not be warped from
the truth. Many of the most bitter misfortunes
which afflict human life, are occasioned, in a
great degree, by the ficticious value we affix to
objects through the ardor of an unchecked ima
gination. There is no purpose to which the un
derstanding can be applied that will so much
promote our real happiness and honor, as in dis
cerning the true character and the real value of
whatever offers itfelf to our consideration.
BOSTON, September i
We are happy to inform the public, that an
opportunity has been lately afforded of trying
the effect of prizes, in exciting the emulation of
Youth, in the public Schools of this town, by
the generous donation of Noah Webster, Esq.
of Hartford.âThis gentleman, soon after the
adoption of the new system of education, in or
der to (hew his approbation of it, presented to
the School committee twelve copics of his " Ame
rican felettiQii oj" L.eJJ'ons in reading and J~pcaling,"
neatly bound, gilt and lettered,"to be distributed
in prizes, annually, at the several reading schools,
as the committee Ihould dired.
The school committee, accordingly, gave infor
mation to the refpetftive matters, of this donati
on ; iince which the committee have attended
the examination of the two upper classes in each
school, and having feledled fix of the most me
ritorious boys in each ofthofe clafles, conferred
four books upon them, and they drew lots for
the fame in presence of this committee.
Our latest account is, by Capt. Hall, from the
port of St. Andero, in Spain, which he left about
the 15th Julyâat which time every preparation
was making for warâand the declaration of it
by England, was momently expecfted :âThe Spa

A/? , NECKER'j Opinion on the Abolition of TITLES of NOBILITY
-..J at* UATI TAr nL'an r*t /-to
and ARMCMUAL BtARINGS.
A REPORT," fays M. Neckar, " having been circulated, thai
t u BaVe Â°P' n ' on Council against accepting the decrce
of the National AlTembly, relative to titles, names, and armorial
bearings, lam called upon to make known the funple fact. I
â was ot opinion, and I prelTed that opinion with much earncftnefs,
that the King, upon acccptin;; the decrce, (hould fend hrsobferva'
tions on it to the National alTembly ; and as I Jhall never dread
the publicity of my adions or my opinions, I avail myfelfofthr
King's permiflion to print those observations as they Rood in thi
draft presented by me. This Ido the more willingly, that th.
National AlTembly has already inftrufted the Committee of Con
uitution to prepare some explanations of this fame decree.
'"I was also of opinion, that the observations (hould be accom
panied by a letter from the King, expressing his Majesty's inclii a
tionto be guided by the knowledge of the National AlTembly
and as this letter formed part of my advice, a draft of it will bJ
found at the end of the observations. I may have been millaken
and I iuppofe I was, since my advice was not followed : But I
choose rather to afford an opportunity of judging clearly. 0 f ms
error, it I have committed any, than to fuffer a vauue fubieft of
reproach to remain, which malignity would daily extend by falft
conftruQions. I am confident of tiie purity of my intentions, I
am equally confident ot my attachment to the conftiiution, and
the true interests of the people ; and these sentiments,, which a,,
ground, of iny confidence, kill always in duct meSo with
cut disguise (Signed) NICKER.
tJI the observations, which extend to considerable length, the
following is an abftrait. "
rV " Â£ ftCn neccl,rar y. when lhc public good requires it, to im.
-pole "crifises on a particular class of citizens, which is always to
be done with circumfpeftion and delicacy, so dangerous is it to
infringe, in any degree, the right of possession and the ordinary
rules of justice. . '
" No deprivation ought to take place, from which no real ad
vantage is derived.
" When exclusive privileges were fuperceded, and taxes equal
ized ; when feudal rights were abolilhed ; when the road to
employments and preferments was opened toall alike ; when all
citizens were callcd together on a footing of equality, to form
National and Legislative AlTcmblies, what was loft by one class
â wis more than counterbalanced by what was gained by another.
But what benefit will the gr. at body of the people derive
from the Decree relative to titles, names, and armorial bearings ?
The numerous class who must live by the wages of their indulUy
employed in the service of otheis, far fro-n feeling hurt at the
lank of their employer, conceive it in some degree rcflcftcd on
them (elves.
" 1 hose whom fortune or education has placed but at a fmal)
diflance from men of title, may enjoy, perhaps, a momentary plea
lure in teeing those link-eminences thatobdrufted their own prof
pefls completely demol.fhed ; but for the fake of an imaginary
benefit so circurtilcribed in us nature is it equitable to dep. ive a
numerous class of citizens of honorary diftinftions, which form
a part of their inheritance, and ot which the loft will be mote pain
ful than that of all the pecuniary advantages they poffeft f
" Without inconvenience, and on juii grounds might the men
tion of titles be forgiven in all Aflcinblies, National or Municipal
â¢where equality is necessary even in appearances ; where it is of so
much importance that the ascendancy Ihould be always reserved
to realonandthe confidence which patriotism infpircs.
" It would also be proper to forbid all honorary additions in
the Magiflration ot citizens, to remind Frenchmen in the begin
ning ot their course, that being equal in the eye of the law they
will be equally fuppotted by it in their efforts to lei ve their coun
try. But, to purfne the diftindions farther, to follow them into
the commerce of private life, would be a severity without use, the
of which would be imprattirable', witiwut infhtutinz
an Inquisition inconftftent with the principles of liberty.
â¢' T he trappings of van:ty arc not lowered in price by an anxi
ous proscription ; but by a carclefs indifference, and by presenting
10 mens minds other objects of ambition.
*' Useless deprivations will induce meu of rank to seek for those
uiltm&ions in foreign countries, which are denied them in their
own, sumptuary laws are found to banilh the oftcntatious and the
wealthy.
" Ii is a hardOiip to oblige a numerous class of citizens to re
lume names, many of which are forgotten; and many families
wilh to be known by names which call to mind the services of
their ancestors.
" It Will be productive of confufion in manypubli<; proceedings.
" All thtle Â«bjeflions apply to the abolition of armorial bear
ings, and wuh greater force, inÂ»fmuch as tliev are, if pofliblc, less
effenfive to th< people.
" Ihe abolition ot liveries might indeed be agreeable to those
â whose lortuue it has been to wear them, but would be a great loss
to the manufa&urers employed in the articles of which they are
sompofed. '
"In pursuing through the most minute details, all marks of dif
tmction, some lifk is run of misleading the people, refpe&ing the
true meaning of the word Equality, which in a civilized nation,
and focietv already formed, can never mean an equalization of
rank or of property. The divcrfity of labours and functions,'the
differences of fortune and education, emulation, industry, the gra
dation of talents and acquirements, all these difparitiei productive
of the facial movement, unavoidably bring with them external in
equalities ; and the sole objed of the Legillator is, in imitation of
nature, to direst them all towards a common good, equal to all,
though different in its form and appearances."
Draft ok tiii Kikg'sLetier.
I he decree of the National Aflembly, refpe6ling titles, names
and armorial bearings, affords jufl grounds of complaint to a nu
merous in focietv, without procuring any advantage to the
people ; and as, not withstanding its importance, it was pafled at
4 -nc fitting, these several considerations have determined me to
*Â°â¢"l unicatc l Â° al * AfTembly some observations on the
fubjea. I desire the AfTembly to examine them, and if that body
should adhere in all points to its firft opinion, I will accept the
decree, as a mark of my relpeft for the wisdom of the Aflembly,
and bccaufe I seta great value on maintaining a perfect harmony
between the AfTembly and myfelf." .

THE PRESENT STATE OF EUROPEAN POLITICS.
Ruflia and Sweden, the only two powers that have a&ed with
any degree of vigour this campaign, appear on both fides as if
pretty well contented with what they have done, and desirous now
Â©f takingbrcath.
The Kings of Hungary and Pruflia, like two prize-fighters, con
tinue t'.ieir menacing posture, but without a blow being flruck on
eiriier fide.
Turkey (lands aloof, as if wishing for peace. The scattered
Clrength of that unwcildy empire always ill adapts her for war;
and the repugnance of her soldiery to discipline, with the blows
she lias lately received, qualify her still lets for it.
Poland, not fort feeing as yet any great benefits from her new
alliance with Pruflia, and dreading the loss of Thorn and Dantzic,
is now in doubt whether she ought notto put herfelf again under
the prote&ion of Ruflia.
France continues her deliberations in tranquility. If flie has
â wit enough to keep out of the broils of her neighbours, the regula
tions of the National Council may have the wilhed foreffeft ; and
a new conflitution be fecn to ?rife, firmly founded on the broad
hafts of liberty.

ilarincd at the number of the intruders, immediately declared

FURTHER EUROPEAN ACCOUNTS.
Several fkinnifhes have taken place be
tween the Swedes and Ruffians at Willikala with
various successâthe Swedes finally were obliged
to evacuate that post with the lofsof several offi
cers and upwards of one hundred soldiers killed
and wounded. Capt. Wirgin under the'directi
on of the King made another attack on the Ruffi
an fleet in the bay of Frederick/hamâbut with
out success. Pare of the Spanish fleet was out the
beginning of July: They have among their hea
\y Ships one carrying I five 124 gans ench;
and are bnilding une with four decks, said to be
the largest Ship ever built. Some of the London
papers mention that the Spaniards are repairing
and extending their works before Gibraltar;
and have 3000 men employed on them.
There has been a horrid scene of confufion
and bloodshed at Nifnies a large City in France ;
instigated by some traiterous characters, among
whom were several Priests, a large party oppo

National militia who went to its relief and to
quell the insurgents marched in over dead bo
diesâ two hundred of the conspirators were kil
led and the reft dispersedâbut UQt without confi.
derable loss to the National troops. The Englijh
papers further ltate, that a most virulent disor
der had broken out in the Spanish fleet which
swept of great numbers of the Sailorsâit had
however received a checkâby introducing stric
ter discipline, and greater cleanliness among the
men.
