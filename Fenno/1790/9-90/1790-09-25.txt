containing general observations on a republican go

Tonr'j, Z.~]
ON ELECTIONS.
AFTER all the minute speculations of the ini
nuteft politicians, we feein to reft in this im
portant truth, that popular security, in republics,
principally conlilts in a certain fair division and
balance in the branches of the government, and
the eftablilhinent of a pure and equal fyftein of
representation. When you have provided pro
per checks, that is, when you have so arranged
the capital parts of the machine, as that, while it
is acting in a right direction, they will move :n
perfect harmony, and when in a wrong direction,
will produce an immediate and mutual resistance ;
and when you have secured such a frequency and
freedom of popular election, as that the democra
tic branch, in the government fliall feel withfen
fibility the interests of their constituents on the
one hand, and their own responsibility on the
other ; you have Sxed the main pillars on which
public liberty mult reft. When you have done
this, you may go on to organize tne Tmaller and
dependant parts of the fyftein, multiply the ob
jects of its exercise, and accumulate its powers
without limitation.
Power cannot of icfelf, render a government
â¢langerous ; because danger generally arises from
irregular operations ; and power, so far from
producing irregular operations, is, in well con
ltructed machinery, the belt preservative against
them ; as weight, imposed upon a perfect arch,
but augments the solidity and security of the
ftrucfture. That the truth of my com pari Ton may
not be mistaken, I mull explain it further. In
the form of a well adjulled republic, there mull
be an interior principle of mutual refiflatice, de
signed efTentially for the security of the people :
Theftronger this check, the more perfect is this
security. I suppose that power has in the poli
tic.il, as in the physical machine, a tendency to
flrengcheu the reciprocal resistance of the parts,
and consequently to augment the security of all
that depends upon it. The security which power
adds to the government itfelf, is derived from
the solidity it gives to the whole, by confirming
the union of its parts : The security which it
gives to the people, arises from its overcoming
all irregular tendencies in the government. The
danger to liberty must spring either from the
irregular operations of the parts, or from the
united and direct operations of the whole go
vernment : Krom the firft of these the admirable
system of balances, eflential in all republics, is an
effectual preservative ; for thelaft we have a free
system of election, as a (till more efficacious and
more radical remedy. This is the 1110 ft irrefifta
ble power in a nation ; it acts with universal and
perpetual influence ; it is a fpirit,which pervades,
invigorates and purifies every part of govern
ment ; the spirit of political regeneration, which
infofeslife, health and beauty into the most de
formed and debilitated body : It is our final re
source in all our painful apprehenhons : It is our
sweetest solace, t.ie firm foundation of our hope,
a relief, ever ready, accompanying the diltempers
it is designed to cure. Let us cling to our right
of election as to the rock of our political fafety.
Our Constitution has provided a system of repre
sentation calculated on the truest principles of
liberty. So ample, that the interest, the feelings
and the wants of all parts of the community are
exprelled in the administration : So equal, that
every citizen, whatever may be his rank or for
tune, has his voice, and every state its jult propor
tion of influence, in the public measures : so fre
quently ren wed, that the representative cannot
lose for a moment the image of his dependence,
nor the conllitucnt the pride of his creative au
â¢hr#nty. It belongs to us to give activity and
energy to this beautiful theory, and to maintain in
fall vigor its inestimable principles.
The design with which I have undertaken to
address you, is to point out and urge the extreme
importance of your right of election. If some of
the remarks I have already made fliould appear
to be foreign to this purpose, I beg you to recol
lect, that contracting thebafis of our security to
a finall conipafs, neceflkrily increases the impor
tance of the parts which compose that basis. If
our resources are few, do we not embrace them
with proportionable ardor ? If there is no dan
ger in bellowing powers, is it not on the ground
of the all powerful influence of election, which,
by operating on the prime interefls and more
fleady paflions of our rulers, gives a salutary di
rection to the public measures > Indeed no politi
cal axiom appears to my mind more demonftrably
true, than that, with a perfect system of elective
representation, no power can possibly be danger

NATIONAL ASSEMBLY
PA his, JULY 13.
M TALMA, an atftor in the French Theatre,
. complained that the Rector of St. Sri/pice,
had refufed to publifli the banns of marriage for
him, alledging that Comedians aiv deprived by
law of the holy sacrament of matrimony.
Several members exprefled their surprize at
this perverse opposition in the Re.lor of St. Slll
pice, adding that it was cultomaiy to admit the
people of the Theatre to the sacrament of matri
mony, under the charter of musicians.
It was decreedââ¢
That the comnittees of the constitution, and
of ecclesiastical affairs, do take this into imme
diate consideration.
The address made to the President by a depu
tation of Americans, was much applauded.
" The force of truth is irrefiftable ; the cele
rity of its progress, beyond calculationâ
" We have long believed that the nations of
the earth would wake out of their lethargy ; and
that men would claim their rights in a voice that
men would not be able to refill. We believed
that religion would be d ifrobed of its borrowed
terrors, and thatfaniuicifm and intolerance would
fly at the presence of reason.
" We have but one wish on the present occasion,
and that is to aflift at the august confederation,
and to swear, at the feet of the fame altar, to be
faithful to the nation, to the law, and to the
King, and to vow eternal friendfhip with the peo
pie of France."
The answer of M. Bonnmy, the President, was
not less applaudedâ
" It was in aiding you to be free, brave Ame
ricans, that the French became acquainted with
Liberty and loved her. The arm which broke
your fetters afunder,difdains to be fettered itfelf.
" But in this refpedl we are more happy than
you were. We have a Patriot King to affilt us in
the recovery of our liberties.
" Liberty cost you torrents of blood, you won
her by your courage. We are free by following
the ditftares of reason, the Throne of Liberty is
now established in the two worlds."
The address and answer were both ordered to
be printed.
LONDON, July 13
THERE are flill idle whispers about the King
of France being rescued, as it is called.
They are wretched politicians who believe that
the King ofFrance, with the History of England
before hiin, will fly from his throne to make it
more secure. He knows that in any country a
King is more easily fonnd than public liberty.
The trial by Jury is much applauded by all
Englifhinen, ami in conjunction with the liberty
of the Press, is justly fuppol'ed to be theftrongeft
pillar of the British Constitution. But when in
dividuals at e called to attend 011 the public ser
vice, it is truly astonishing what trifling excuses
are made. One wilhes to be exempted because
he has served in the army ; another because his
eltate is not fufficiently large ; a third because
he has only a copy hold ; and a fourth pretends
he is deaf or has got the gout.
The determination against the notorious old
Mother Hajfe! does honor to the Jury who tried
the cause, and it is hoped will operate as a prece
dent now eltablifhed by several trials, that a bond
or note given by a fednccd female to the mistress
ot a brothel is invalid and cannot be recovered
and that those unhappy females who have unfor
tunately fallen into the clutches of those pelts
to society, are not bound to pay for either board,
lodging, or clothing, furniihed evidently for the
pur pose of a proltitution, from the profits of
which those Ba-xds exac r t about nine-tenths of the
whole.
Mr. Winne, a quaker, a man of the firft re
fpertability, who has a considerable plantation in
Jamaica, in a letter to a gentleman at Birming
ham, declares, that he knows several plantations
on that island, where slaves are treated with a
due degree of kiudnefs, which not only keeps,
but increases the number of their slaves, without
ever purchasingâHis own estate is one of these.
Ar,d by this mild and gentle manner of encou
raging the negroes to perform their work,he has
increased the produce ot his lands four fold. In
deed Mr. Winne fays, " I am acquainted with
the proprietor of a plantation, whose negroes
have doubled their number in eighteen years,
and three over, whilst in that period the planta
tion has greatly increased its produce. On the
other tiand, fays he, 1 know another plantation
where, in three years, the slaves have been di
minished seventy-two, which was more than a
third of their whole number, merely by acls of
feveriry and cruel treatmentsâMr. Winne con
eludes his letter with observing, he is well con
vinced the abolition of the slave-trade would be
of the highest advantage to the planters, consi
dered only m a pecuniary point of view
Bella horrida bella !â at present rages in the
Carnatic. Earl Cornwallis mod certainly hasfent
a bold defiance to the tyrant Tippoo, whom it is
earnestly to be wilhed may now meet the fate
nis inlolenceand cruelty deserve.

REMARKS dN* TH2 ENGLISH LAKGOAcijr
NOTHING is more common in our courts, than
the ule o( the word evidence for vituefs Th
person who teftifies is called an evidence "and *
unfrequently by men of considerable eminence'
But it is equally common to use the word cviderc't
for tejlimonj, a person gives hir evidence. This con
fufion of terms is altogether inexcusable anion?
profeliional men ; for technical language ihould
always be corre<ft.
The person declaring is a witncfs ; what he de
clares, is his t-flimony - the effect of what lie de
clares, is evidence. Evidence is the effect of /.,
mony in producing conviction, or it is the proof
ariling out of testimony. The diftiii&ion will be
clearly obvious in thisconcife phrafe,fA f evidence
produced by the teflimony oj the viitnefs.'
The oath administered to witnetlcs in this State
runs thusâ " you swear that the evidence you Ihall
give to this court, fliall be the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth." Here the
word evidence is very improper ; for how can a
man swear to his evidence! Or can a man fay
what effedt his declarations will huve on another i
uiind, in makinga thing evident. The oath ihocid
run thus, " you swear to declare to this court the
truth, the whole truth, &c." or, " you swear
that the teflimony you shall give to this court, &c."
Whatever carelessness may have done in introdu
cing such confufion of words into use, the dif
tinc r tions ought to be known and observed.
In anew country like America, it is of conse
quence that words should have one uniform mean
ing through the country. It is a misfortune that
the word Court has very different figniScations ia
different States. In Maflachufetts, and Connec
ticut, General Court is the conflitutional name of
the Legislature ; in Maryland and Virginia, Ge
neral Court is the constitutional name of the Su
preme Judicial Court. I bave known persons in.
converlation led into material errors by this dif.
ference. The v ord Court, traced back to anti
quity, is found to figuify the afleinblics or coun
cils of men, who, in ages of simplicity, had both
legislative and judicial powers ; as the county
courts or shire motes of the Saxons in England,
and the cortes of Spain. But it is to be regretted
that in this country, the word should have diftiiuS
and opposite figuifications. N.- W,

SUMMARY of EUROPEAN INTELLIGENCE
by arrivals which Ujt LONDON t:u lajl oj JULY. '
ACongrefs is fitting in S;leGa, the result of whose deliberations
is to dccide on the continuance of the continental war, or
the future peace of Germany. Prussia, Auflria, Ruflia, Poland,
&c. are represented in this Congress.
The affairs of the rerolutionifts are said to be in a very unpro
mising way: BrufTel. is shut up, and no one fuffered to g<> in or
out, without a patfport ; the port of Oflend is also said to be shut.
TJn the 14th July, the day of the grand federative meeting of
France, 600 per Tons met at the Crown and Anchor tavern in Ton
don, to celebrate this glorious anniversary of French freedom.
At this meeting it was proposed to Lord Stanhope, that he
should follow the example of several of the French Nobility, by
iurrendering his title, and the rights and privileges ot the peerage.
This his Lordihip declined to do.
War now rages in the East-Indies. Lord Cornwallis, in con
fluence of Tippo Saib's treachery, has determined to attack that
Prince.
A battle has been fought between the Turks and Ruflhns in
Cuban, in which the latter were beaten : A number of prisoners,
several heads, and a large sack of ears were brought to ConiUnii
nople.
The Ruffian fleet has been defeated in such manner as renders
the Turks afcfolutc Mafic-. <>f the Mcditeiranean : The Ruffians
have however gained a recent advantage over the Turks, near the
Khine, a body of them being defeated by 0 n. Clairfelt.
Leopold appears determined to bring the Brabanters to terms
by force : He declaims every idea of treating with fubjcQs in re
bellion. The Protestants of Hungary have made a claim to equal
privileges with their fellow fubjefts : This demand it is feared
will not be complied with without opposition by the Catholics.
The celebration of the grand anniversary of French Freedom
was followed bv a fcrics of rejoicings in Paris, to the fufpenliun,
in a great measure, of all kinds of bufiuefs. '
The abolition of Titles of Nobility in Francc, has not been fol
lowed with the extinttion of Clerical Titles and Diftinftions :
Perhaps the National Assembly had the uufucccfsful innovations
on the Church made by the late Emperor of Germany in mind.
Thcfe titlesarc however moreabfurd and dangerous than any other
âscripture and common sense are certarnly against them.
In the Grand Federative ProceiTion of France, there was a body
of 150 Englifhmm ; they wore a ribbon with this inlcription,
Ãbi ibi Put) in.
The elcttor of Bavaria has refufed to give his vote in favor of
Leopold, King of Hungary, at the ensuing elc&ion of Emperor,
at Frankfort.
In ronfequenceofa leport that a battle had been fought between
the British troops and some ot the Nabobs of India, India Siock
fell?, per cent, the 24 July.
The Parisians, according to the Englifti papers, arc touch dis
pleased that the King did not advance to the AltAr, and take the
Civic Oath.
In a violent florin at the Cape of Good Hope on the 12 April
last, the frigate C.uaidian, Lieut. Riou's ship, w;Â»s beat to pieces,
and many other vessels were destroyed
The Englifti they fay have now 52 fail of the line in commiflion.
Great tumults prevail in the city of Lyons, in France :
tifm and aristocracy are no more ; but licentiousness prevails in
their room : The National Assembly are sedulously employed in
adopting measures for the restoration of good order.
The rendezvous of the diffe-. Nt corps of the National Confede
ration was at the Boulevards du Temple, from thence they weat
to join the National Assembly at the place of Louis XV : This
proceflion was a striking fight, but nothing was more effecting than
when the Deputies of Bearne arrived at the spot where Henry the
Great fell by the hand of a fanatic. They all flopped for a mo
ment in fil' nee and then paid to the memory of this Prince,
ji ' peopleâmilitary honors while the loudeii
plaudits (hewed how every citizcn intercfted himfcif in the mov
ing scene.
One of the most striking ensigns exhibited in the Grand Feder
ative Proceflion of France, was inferibed in letters of "old
THE LIBERTY OF THE PRESS. It was the firft in order
in the proceflionâand plainly evinced, that the people'of France
have perfectly ascertained to what they are indebted for the free
dom they now enjoy.
Commerce in Fiance, will now r~ar its long deprefled head ;
the academy of Paris offer a valuable prire for the beft'eompofi
tion, eitherfn prose or verseâon the origin, progress and dignity
of commerce. Thus this great and important fubjeft, so long
held in contempt by the French nobility and noblcfu - , will (hort
ly excite the emulation ot the fii ft characters in that count 1 y, and
add ftrcngth and energy to freedom.
The Hotel de Villr at Paris diftiibuted copper medals to
the Deputies of the Provinces, commemorative of the Grand Con
tederation.
A solemn funeral Oration, to the memory of Dr. Franklin, was
delivered in the Church of Kotre Dame, in Paris, at which the
National Aflembly were present.
The King of Pruflia has inteidiftcd all communication between
Silesia and the Auiliian Territories.
Very few Pat ifian families of the higher order were in the citv
at the time of celebrating the Confederation ; having previously
removed into the country on account of the vast coucourfe of peo
ple aflembled from all parts of the kingdom.
It is fuppolcd not left than five hundred thousand persons were
afTemblcd in the Champ de Mars ; and ahho the weather was un
pleasant and rainy, fatisfa&ion and mirth were pointed on every
countenance.
The Irish it ferms have got the {tort of the Englifli in common

Lord raised the firft Regiment of Light Dragoons
âthis was in the year 1750 :He had the command to the day of
his death: This was the only Regiment in Britain which never
changed its Colonel.
A Ipirited Addrefstc the people of IrelandÂ« from the citizens of
Dublin, on the fubje&s ot reprcfcntation,taxation, Handing armies,
&c. See. was publifhcd the firft of June last, and is now circulating
in that kingdom.
Nearly 200,000 people were employed in preparing the Champ
de Mars for the grand scene 011 the 14th July : Persons of all des
criptions afiifted. The King himfelt to encourage and animate
the people, wheeled away three barrows of gravel
There were in the grand Proceflion 100 infants, carried in their
mothers' arms, decorated with the national cockade.
In the Kmg's Amphitheatre the Queen had a chair her,
in which she was seated with the Dauphin on her knee : She was
mo H beautifully diefled : Her capdecorated with pearlsâa pearl
necklace and earningsâNo diamonds ! Her appearance was en
chanting.
The Kinj; was seated in a chair of State : He was superbly dres
sed : The Crown had been removed from the top of the chairâ
and the Cap of Liberty substituted : The President of the Nation
al Aflembly fat in a chair, placed in a line w;:h the King's.
At five minutes after four, the King rose, and waiting ti J every
tiling was Client, read very audibly, and with great majesty of ex
pieflion the oath alligned himâas follow*, viz,
I the King of French men, swear to the nation to make use of
all the power that is delegated to me by the constitutional laws of
the Rate, in maintaining the couftitution, and causing the laws to
be put into execution.
As scon as he had read it, he, as the reft had done, extended his

BOSTON, September 18
By a veflel arrived at Marblehead, from Spain,
letters have been received by gentlemen in this
town, from their correspondents at Cadiz, dated
as late as July 20, 1790.âThe following are ex
tracfted therefrom, viz.
" Cadiz, July &th.
" We Ihall be relieved from the state of sus
pense, in which we are, in the course of a few
as the armament is finifhed, and every
thjng appears to announce a Ipeedy declaration
of war with England.

efterday Edward I ail and "John Bailey % a black man,
who have been leverally convifcfced of burglary, were brought to
the bar; when his honor Chief-Juftice Sargent, after 4 few preli
minary obfeivations, which did great honor to his head and heart,
pronounced sentence of Death on both of them.
The court-houfc, on this occasion, was crowdcd with citizens
âattia&ed by the uncommon fight, of a fellow citizen, as Brown
once was, the head of a family, who until of late years, supported
an unblemished character for probity and industry, and who once
b*d fair to be a man of affluenceâarraigned at the bar of public
justice, to receive sentence of death for anattrocious crime. While
commiseration call a gloom on every countenance, a solemn silence
indicated the im predion which each one received from the scene.
Brown appeared in much distress, and whilst the sentence was
delivering, funk down on the floor.
In noticing the manufaflures of our country, we must not omit
the Bcdticking manufa&ory, at Nantucket - which has produced
Ticking, that haj commanded approb and a quick sale, both

MIDDLETOWN, September 18.
Yeftcrday fe'nmght a boy aged 10 years, living near the river

ground, with very little injury to himfelf, only spraining hiÂ« wrist
ar.d otherwise tiilly brufing himfelf.âThe circumflances ol the
above were as follows, viz. The lad had the preceding day made
tail fomc logs to a wharf, and being abed in the garret and asleep,
about 10 o'clock in 1- j evening, drcamrO that the logs had gone
adrift, and that he dove from the wharf to prevent their going oil';
instead of which it appears he dove out at the window. The fa
mily being al fmed by his groaning immediately discovered him
on the groundâhe appeared as if jufl awaking from a lound deep,
and could give no account of what had pal Ted except his dreaml
which he perfectly recollected.
NEW-YORK, SEPTEMBER 2 j.
Extra (I of a letter /rem London, dated in July.
" Whatever report may fay on the fubjefl of tne naval arma
ment of Britain, you may rely 011 it, that uie fleet equipping con
fids of but sixteen fail ol the line, and which to this moment are
by no means manned, notwithftandingeveryfexertion by impress;
even the much talked of popularity of a war with Spain, has not
prevented their f weeping the prisons, and yet the fleet mull remain
unmanned till thearrival of their Weft-India (hips.
" You will hear much of ten fail of Dutch liueof battle ships,
haying joined the Englilh ; but in this report there is no truth j
neither is it pofCble for Holland to arm ten ships at present, weie
they so inclined; five fail of the line they can and will man. Lord
Auklapd is at the Hague, urging a compliance with the treaty :
Amftcrdam, however, gives every opposition to his measures, and
despises the Prince of Orange, as the tool and creatureof Britain.
" You will be told of counter-revolutions in France, but to such
reports, pay not the least attention, as every idea of the fort is in
tirely abandoned. The King of Spain demanded of the Count
Florida Blanca, to name an officer to command a body of
troops to re-instate his brother of France. The Count asked per
miflion to refer his Majeft) to Count D'Aranda, who from his
personal and accurate knowledge of the situation of France, was
well qualified to head an army for this purpose. With wha- body
of troop^,demanded the Monarch,can you penetrate into the heart
of France ? I believe, Sire, replied the Count, at the head of fifty
thousand men the thing is pratticable ; but I beg leave to add. as
my opinion, that not a man of them would return, because the Na
tional Assembly have thirteen hundred thousand troops devoted
to them : The difficulty was deemed insurmountable, and every
idea on the fubjett has been since rejected.
" As to Spain, it : well known they havebeen arming, without
intermiflion, since the commotions in Hol!and, in J 787 ; an>)
were powerful enough, before Britain wasalarnvd, to have crip
pled the naval nerve of England, by intercepting the E-(l and
Weft-India fleets j but they want enterprize, and in cafe of war
will have caufeto lament omiting this blow.
" America is rising very rapidly in consequence ; and since the
prominent national features that (he displays by her new consti
tution, the powers of Europe heretofore unwilling to do her jus
tice, discover symptoms of more than refpeft. This Court, I
aver, will concede many points that they have heretofore obsti
nately contended for ; and Spam is already foliating your fricud
fhip, by having ordered the Governor of New Orleans not to in
terrupt you in a free navigation of the Miififlipi."

minute attentionâand with no Iniall degree of
latisfaftion, we feel ourselves happy in being the
firft that announced with authenticity, tlieconclu
lion of the day, without any of those horrid con
sequences which were apprehended by many, and
â¢wiihed for by feme
Excepting theburllingof a cannon, and the fall
of a tree, by which one man loft his life, we have
not heard of any c:lier accident. The idea of
freedom wâs general, and as the ultimate end
was happinels, common lenfe and proper pru
dence directed e\ery man to keep the peace, and
rejoice in the event.

urns about the altar : The form Â©fit was round
the cieling painted of sky bl.ie, and was orna'

for his Majelty, the Royal Family, the Foreign
Mm liters, the National Aflembly, the Municipal

A long delay took place in the cxpe&ation tfcl3
