â¢v.Â«THOUGHTS ON GOVERNMENT,
APPLICABLE TO THE
PRESENT STATE or thi AMERICAN COLONIES.
Written in the Year 1776,
By the VICE-PRESIDENT of the United States,
Then a Member of ;
In a LETTER to the Hon. GEORGE WYTHE,
o[ Virginia.
My dear Sir,
IF I was equal to the taflc of forming a plan for the government
of a colony, I (hould be flattered with your request, and very
happy to comply with it ; because as the divine science of politics
is the science of social happiness, and the bleflings of society de
pend entirelv on the const tutions of government, which are gene
rally institutions that last for many generations, there can be no
employment more agreeable to a benevolent mind, than arcfcarch
after the best.
Pope flattered tyrants too much when he said
" For forms of government let fools contefl.
" That which u befl adminiflered is befl.'*
Nothing can be more fallacious than this : But poets read history
to colleÂ£l flowers not fruitsâthey attend to fanciful images, not
the effedls of social institutions. Nothing is more certain from
the history of nations, and the nature of man, than that some forms
of government are better fitted for being well aaminiftered than
others.
We ought to conudcr, whnt is the end of government, before
we determine which is the best form.âUpon this point all Ipe
eulative politicians will agree, that the happiness of society is the
end of government, as all divioes and moral philosophers will
agree that the happiness of the individual is the end of man. From
this principle it will follow, that the form of government, which
communicates ease, comfort, fccunty, or in one word happiness
to the grcateft number of persons, and in the greatest degree, is the
best.
All sober enquirers after truth, ancient and modern, Pagan and
Christian, have declared that the happiness of man, as well as his
dignity consists in virtue. Confucius, Zoroatler. Socrates, Ma
hornet, not to mention authorities really sacred, have agieed in
this.
Ifrhereisa form of government then, whose principle and
foundation is virtue, will not every sober man acknowledge it
better calculated to promote the general happiuefs than any other
form ?
Fear is the foundation of mod governments ; but is so fordtd
and brutal a paflion, and renders men, in whose breads it pre
dominates, so itupid, and miserable, that Americans will not be
likely to approve of any political institution which is founded on
it.
Honour is truly sacred, but holds a lower rank in the scale of
moral excellence than virtue. Indeed the former is but a part of
the latter, and confcquently has not equal pretensions to support a
frame of government produ&ive of human happiness.
The foundation of every government is some principle or pas
sion in the minds of the people. The noblest principles arid moll
generou affcclions in our nature then, have the fai re ft chance to
support the noblest and most generous models of government.
A man mul\ be indifferent to thefneers of modern Englishmen,
to mention in their company, the names ot Sidney, Harrington,
Locke, Milton, Nedham, Neville, Burnet, and Hoadley. No small
fc>rtrude is nercflTary to confefs that one has read them. The
â¢wrctched condition of this country, however, for ten or fifteen
years past, has frequently reminded me of their principles and
xeafonings. They will convince anv cancid mind, that there is
no good government but what is Rcp> lican. Tnat the only val
uable part at the Hritifh Conkru >so; because the very deft-.
nition of a Republic, is " an lvnpire of Laws, and not of Men."
That, as a Republic is t r be ft of governments, so that particular
arrangement of th:- v/crs of focietv, or in other words that form
*f government, which is best contrived to fccure an impartial and
cxatt r xecu'.ion of the laws, is the best of R publics.
0Â» l Republics, there is an inexhaustible variety, because the pos
sible combinations of the powers of society, arc capable of innu
merable variations.
As pood governments an empire of laws, how shall your laws be
made? In a large society, inhabitating an extensive country it is
impoflible that the whole should afTemble, to make laws : The
firft necefTary step then, is, to depute power from the many, to a
few of the mod wife and good.âBut by what rules (ball you
choose your Reprefcntatives ? Agree upon the number and quali
fications of persons, who shall have the benefit of choosing, or an
nex this privilege to the inhabitants of a certain extent of ground.
The principal difficulty lies, and the greatcfl care should be em
ployed in configuring this Reprefentativc AfTembly. It should
be in miniature, an exaÂ£l portrait of the people at large. It (hould
think, feel, rcafon, and ast like them. That it may be the interefl
of this aflembly to do ftrifljuflice at all times, it should be an
equal representation, or in other words equal interefl among the
people should have equal interefl in it. Great care should be ta
ken to effett this, and to prevent unfair, partial, and corrupt elec
tions. Such regulations, however, may be better made in times of
greater tranquility than the present, and they will spring up of 4
themfclves naturally, when all the powers of government come to
be in the hands of the people's friends. At present it will be faf
cfl to proceed in all eftablilhed modes to which the people have
been familiarifed by habit.
A representation of the people in one AfTembly being obtained,
a queflion arises whether all the powers of governmenr, legislative,
executive,and judicial, shall be left in this body? I think a peo
ple cannot be long free, nor ever happ), whole government is in
one AfTembly. My reasons for this opinion arc as follow.
1. A Angle AfTembly isliable to all the vices, follies and frailties
of an individual. Subjcfl to si'S of humour, starts of passion,
flights of cnthufiafm, partialities, of prejudice, and confcquently
produflive of hasty results and absurd judgments : And ail these
errors ought to be corrected and defeats fupplicd by some con
trolling power.
2. A (ingle afTembly is apt to be avaricious, and in time will not
scruple to exempt itfelf from burthens which it will lay, without
compun&ion, on its constituents.
3. A single AU'einbly is apt to grow ambitious, and after a time
â¢will not hefitateto vote itfelf perpetual. This was one fault of the
long Parliament, but more remarkably of Holland, whose AfTem
bly firft voted thrm f elves from annual to septennial, then for
life, and after a courfeof years, that all vacancies happening by
death, or otherwise, should be filled by themselves, without any
application to conflitupnts at all.
4. A Representative Alfembly, altho' extremely well qualified,
and absolutely neceflary, as a branch of the legislature, is unfit to
exercifc the executive power, for want of two cflential properties,
fecrecyand dispatch.
,5. A Rcprefentative /.ITembly is still less qualified for the judi
cial power ; bccaufe it is too numerous, too flow, and too little
{lolled in the laws.
6, Because a Tingle AfTembly, pofTefled of all the powers of go
vernment, would make arbitrary laws for their own intcreft,execute
all laws arbitrarily for their own intcreft, and adjudge all contro
verfics in their own favour.
But shall the whole power of legislation reft, in one AfTembly ?
Most of the foregoing reasons apply equally to prove that the le
gislative power ought to be more complexâto which we may add,
that if the lcgiflative power is wholly in one AUembly, and the ex
ecutive in another, or in a single person, these two powers will
oppofeand encroach upon each other, until the contefl shall end
in war, and the whole power, legislative and executive, be ufarped
by ihe ftrongcil.
The judicial power, in such cafe, could not mediate, ar liolJ
the balance between the two contending powers, becau.e t c egi
flative would undermine it. And this ihews the neceility too, of
giving the executive power a negative upon the legislative, ot ler
wifc this will be continually encroaching upon that.
To avoid these dangers let a diftinft Atfemblv be constituted, as
a mediator between the two extreme branches of the legmature,
that which represents the people and that which is veftcd with the
executive power.
Let the Representative AfiTembly then elect by ballot, from
among themselves or their conllituents, or both, a diitintt Atiem
bly, which for the fake of perspicuity we will call a Council. It
may consist of dny number you please, fay twenty or thirty, and
(hould have a free and independent exercise ot its judgment, and
consequently a negative voice in the legislature.
These two bodies thus constituted, and made integral pruts of
the legislature, let them unite, and by joint ballot choofc a Gover
nor, who, after being dripped of moll of those badges of domina
tion callod prerogatives, ihould have a free and independent cxpi
cife of his judgment, and be madealfo an integral part oi the le
gislature. This I know is liable to obje&ions. .>nd if you please
you may make him only President ofthe Council, as in Connecti
cut : But as the Governor is to be inveiled with the executive
power, with confentof Council, I think he ought to have a nega
tive upon the legislative. If he is annually as he ought tQ
be, he will alv. ays have so much reverence and aiteciion for the
people, their Keprelentutives and Counsellors, that although yOu
give him an independent exercise of his judgment, he will f< ldom
use it in opposition tothe twohoufes, except in cases the public uti
lity of which would be confpicuoua, and some such cases would
happen.
In the present exigency of American affairs, when, by an ast of
'arliomcnt we are put out of the royal prote&ion, and conicquent
y difchargcd from our allegiance ; and it has become necelTary to
flume government for our immediate security, the Gov. Lieut,
jov. Secretary, Treafurcf, Comm lTarv, Attorney-General, should

elections, especially of Representatives and Counsellors, should be

slavery begins."

FOR THE GALETTE OF 1 HE UNITED STATES.
MR. EDITOR,
SPECULATION in public securities, or the
debts of the United States, and the individual
States, began with the debts themselvesâit is a
neceflkry and uniform consequence of paper re
presentatives of specie, on any principle what
ever, funded or not funded : In the former cafc,
it is seldom injurious when the funds are good
and sacredly applied : In the latter it is always
carried toexcefsâandi3 attended with pernicious
effects.
The United States, previous to the adoption of
the new Conltirution, poflfefled no fundsâbecaufe
they had no legislative power. A vain confidence,
however, in the success of congressional requifi
tionSy procured a circulation for a time, of the
many millions of paper which the old Congress
iflued. A failure on the part of the respective
States in complying with the lequifitions, laid
the foundation of that itnmenfe depreciation
which followedâand opened the flood gates of
speculation. For a considerable time before the
difTolution of the old government, the receipts
into theTreafury of the United States, were said
to be little more than fuflicient to pay the officers
of government : These, however, it is to be pre
sumed, were punctually paid, as very few of them
appeared anxious for a change.
A debt fit'jated as that of the United Stares was,
mud have been in desperate circuinltancesâand
it is demonstrable, that before this day, it would
have totally funk in the hands of the pofleflors,
but for the new Conflitution. How far this was
the wish of many of the oppofers of a change in
our political fitnation, time may developeâbut
at present, thank Heaven, it is not material to
inveltigate. The time is now come, when the
business of speculation, it is to be hoped, will be
brought to very narrow limits, and become so un
productive, as to be not worth pursuing : And in
order to effect this great and valuable object, it
is become neceflary that confidence in the faith
and honor of government, should take place of
that distrust and jealousy, which have led too
many of our citizens to facrifice their hard earn
ed property for a very trifling consideration.
The business of speculation, in its firft stages,
was carried on in a very exceptionable and difin
genuous manner : The country was filled with a
set of itiu erant {harpers, who gulled the unwary
and uninformed out of their property by every
species of deception : This mode of prosecuting
the business, was the only one in which it was
carried on for a considerable timeâbuttheellab
lifhinent of offices in the capital towns on the
continent, produced an open and fair market
and the fame principles which apply in other
branches of traffic, obtaining in this also, it then
became the interest of the negociators to buy and
fell on the lowest terms. This open market broke
up the itinerants in a great measure, and afford,
ed every pofleflor an opportunity to get the high
est price that could poflibly be obtained for liis
paper. It is however said, that the ambulatory
tribe is not extinctâbut the late rife in pub
lie paper has added wings to their feetâand in
many mltances the credulous and nnfufpedinsr
have fuffered by sudden and hasty sales.
It is surely high time that confidence in the
government should poflefs the minds of the pub
lic creditors umverfally : Those whose faith has
not failed them for several months part, have ad

ST OCKH OL M, July 13
An unfuccefsful attempt made by the King of
Sweden to deltroy tlie Ruffian coaftingfijuadron at
Viborg, and the approach of the Prince de Naflau
xvith the Cronitadt division, had already render
Â«d the position of the Swedes at the entrance of
Viborg Bay extremely critical, when the fcnrci
ty of ammunition, and the want of provisions,
made their return to their own ports a measure
of neceflity.
The King resolved therefore to avail himfelf of
â¢ strong eaiterly wind, which fee in 011 the 3d,
wd to set fail with both fleets for Swenlk-Sund
and Sweaborg,
The grand fleet had to penetrate thro' a nar
row pass, and to sustain the fire of four Ruffian
line of battle ships, two of which were placed on
each fide of the Strait. After this it had to en
gage the whole of Admiral TfchitfchakofTs line,
which was drawn up along/the coast, at a small
â¢distance, while liis frigates were ranged among
the islands which lie nearer the shore.
The Swedish van, under Admiral Modee, pas
sed the Strait, without fufferingany ellential lol's,
firing with great spirit both broadiides againit
the enemy. The cannonade from the four Ruf
fian (liips was however so powerful, and continu
ed to be so well supported, that it was resolved
by the Duke ofSuderniania to make an attempt
to burn them. But this operation proved lo un
fuccefsful, that the fire lliips employed in it were
driven upon one of his lloyal Highnefs's own
line of battle ships, and a frigate, both of which
blew up.
This accident seems to havecaufeda degree of
confttfion among the ihips th it were to follow,
four, of which itruck upon the rocks, [and were
left to the mercy of the enemy.
On their farther coui fe along the coast, with a
climinifhed force, the Swedes loil ".vo more /hips
of the line, which were taken by the enemy.
The engagement cotitin ued all night, and part
of the ne*t day [the 4th], 011 the evening of
which the Duke of Sudermania arrived at Swea
borg.
, The fate of the coasting fleet is not so exaclly
known, no oflicial accounts having yet been re
â¢eived from it : But it is certain tliat the King
arrived the fame evening in Swenfk-Sund, with
a large part of the fleer, having loit fix gallies,
with eight hundred men (of the (ruards) which
taken by the Ruffians, besides a number of
finaller vellels taken or funk, reported to amount
to sixty. The whole Joss in men, on the part of
the Swedes, is estimated at seven thousand.
His Swedifli Majesty, having supplied the re
mains of his squadron with provjfions and am
munition, and having been joined by the divisi
on under M. de Cronftadc, which had not been
able to reach the Bay of Viborg, is already failed
again, with a view to prevent the Prince of Naf
fiu, who is said to be advancing with the Cron-
Itadt and Viborg squadrons, from getting into
the port of Fredericklham.
LONDON, July 16
Mr. Fitzherbert, weunderftand, will certainly
leave Madrid on the ioch Aug. The considera

Courts of Madrid and London terminate on that

answer is already well understood : "Etiquette,
and the Treaty and Faith of Nations preclude
hostilities before that dayâin the mean time,
the fleets of each power will be at sea, and wait

tude, which will be communicated to them by

Chas'd tyrannic pow'r away.

The Earl of Stanhope introduced the next toa.l
in a Itiort and pointed address, in which he said,
that the company was allembled together that
day io celebrate one of the greatest and moll im
portant Revolutions that had ever happened. It
had rellored to the rights of men twenty four
millions of human beings.âlt had dellroyed a
government of foul corruption, intrigue and ty
rannyâand, 011 the utter ruin of a fyltem of sla
very, it hail in the iliort space of one year ella
blilhed a government, founded on the natural
equality of men. They had even in this glorious
iy Item improved on the conititution of England,
for they had not only ellabliihed civil, but reli
gious liberty. They had 110 laws to complain of,
such as difgaaced our Statute hook. '1 hey did
not restrain their women from going out of the
kingdom, lell they ihould be converted from their
religionânor had they any law by which their
clergy, by falling and prayer, were enabled to
call out devils. They had abolilhed tythes, and
they had made a provision, that no description of
men ihould be driven from offices of trull, be
cause they had the bad fortune or the good for
tune to differ from the eftabiilhed church.
Having concluded a very liandfome culogium
on tiieir conduct, by faying that in many things
they had given us a lesion, from which we ought,
in virtuous emulation, to improve, he gave as the
next toast.
6. An end to all jealouiles between Britain and
Franceâand may they vie with each other in ex
tending to all the other nations of the earth, peace,
virtue and liberty.
Dr. Price, in a ihort paper, paid an elegant
compliment to the grand fyfteni of liberty they
liad eltabliilicd. It was an union between pliilo
fophy aqd politics ; for in its spirit it not only
â went to give the people of France their just en
joyment of liberty, but it looked abroad to other
nations, and held forth peace and good will to
all people, as fellbw beings and as brethren.
The people of France particularly pointed to
England, as to the country with which, for their
mutual intereft,and for the interests of mankind,
they wiihed moll eagerly to be united. He knew
from the nioft refpecftable quarter, that they
were not only desirous of this, but that an offer
of such an alliance was likely to be made. Iffo,
what imilt not be the effect offucli an alliance on
all the nations of the earth ! Holland on this
lidc of tlie globe, and America on the otUei" ;
would join the grand confederacy, and, thus
united, they would ensure peace to the whole
world. He concluded with exprelling in a i'en
timent. what ni nit be the cordial wilh of all men
on the fubje<9i.
7. /i league between Great-Britain and France
for perpetuating peace, and making the world
happy.
8. To the memory of those Patriots 111 France
who have loft their lives in fighting for the liber
ties of their country
The Earl of Sian'.iope here read to the com
>any ihe oath which ihe National AHembly have
prepared for the King, to take on the day of the
General Confederation.
9. M. de la Fayette, M. Bailli, and M. de Mi
rabeau, M. de Rabau de St. Etienne, and the reft
of the Patriots of France.
10. M. Sheridan, and the reft ofthe Patriots of
E.igland, who have defended against prejudice,
the French Revolution.
Mr. Sheridan, in a most eloquent speech, re
turned. thanks to the numerous body, lor the ve
ry warm and gratifying manner in which they
had done him the honor to drink his health. It
was a most ample reward for his public conduct,
to oe so honored by a meeting of men, allembled
from their pure attachment to freedom ; and he
afiured them, that the sentiments he had exprefi
cd 011 the French Revolution, he should carry
with him through life. In every iituation he
should ad: on the fame principles ; for, in his
mind, though it would be a molt narrow thing to
objetft to the French Revolution, if it did nothing
more than secure to Frenchmen their jult and
natural rights, yet it was pregnant with the molt
beneficent consequences to this country, and to
humankind. We know from fatal experience,
that the old Monarchy of France, ever looked
forward to war as the means of preserving and
augmenting its tyranny. We already have a
proof in the conduct of the National Aflembly,
that they were actuated by a very different spirit.
The expressions of good will which the noble
Chairman had so truly afcribedto them, and tlie
intention which Dr. Price had slated, that they
entertained of proposing an alliance with this
country, were so advantageous to Great-Britain
and to mankind, that they demanded the most
marked return of kindness and good will from
us. It had Itruck him and other gentlemen, that
our feelings on the fubjeift Ihould be exprelledin
something more pointed than a toast, and with
the permiifion of the company he would move a
few words in the way of resolution. He then
moved that it be resolved " That "this meeting
does most cordially rejoice in the eftablilhment
and confirmation of liberty in France; and that
it beholds with peculiar fatisfacftion the senti
ments of amity and goodwill which appear to
pervade that country towards this ; especially at
a time when it is the manifeft intcreft of both
Srates that neither should interrupt the harmony
which at present subsists between them, and which
is so eflential to the freedom and happiness not
only of both nations, but of all mankind."
This resolution was received by the whole
Meeting, with the most vehement acclamations
of applause, and which were damped only for a
time by
Mr. Home Tooke representing himfelf, and
mounting the table to speak, a general murmur
ran through the room, and it was sometime be
fore he could be heard. At length he was fuf
fered to begin. He said, when he was a younger
man, he flattered the women, but he disdained to
flatter men. He was utterly careless of the ap
plause of the company. He knew of better re
wards than their favor, and he should be happy
even in their disapprobation. He desired they
would in their resolution, mark the diftincftion
between this government and that of France.
They had to build a ship from the keel. We had
a ship with a found bottom, but which had only
gathered foine concretions, and wanted to be
docked.
Mr. Sheridan then shortly animadverted on
some paflages of what Mr. Tooke had said. He
should not depart iroin what he had said, that
the approbation of a great public body.com'pofed
not of party men, but of men of all parties altera
bled from one principle, was to him the hicrheft
reward for political services that he looked to
Mr. Tooke might prefer other rewards : he did
not wish to envy him his gratification, whatever
it might be. He certainly, in his resolution, did
not point at any difference in thetwo countries
but lie was free to confefs, that though there was
much room for improvement in the British go
vernment, he should never,in any situation, coun
tenance the introduction of anarchy on the one
hand, neither should he support tyranny under
the pi etext of avoiding anarchy on the otlie.
The resolution was then put to the fhevv of
hands, and carried unanimously.
Mr. Sheridan then gave as a toast
winV-r^f^ 3 ' 1^813 " 110156 ' which was drank
with great joy. Â«Â«Â«Â»â¢

" Ecfolvca, That the company feel equal fe.
tisfaiTtioii, that the people of England by ti?-
virtuous exertions ot their ancestors, haven t f
arduous a talk to perforin as those of France h
now had ; and that they have only to mai.S
and improve the Conftituyon which their tncef
tprs have tranfuiitted to them."
It vvas then moved and resolved, that the res
lutions be tranfmicted to the National AflemhlÂ°*
and be published in our newspapers.
The President jlien gave the following toasts â¢
12. Equal religious liberty to all mankind
1?. All equal representation to the people in
Parliament. .
14. The sacred rights of men, and may all
nations have wisdom to understand, and
to defend them.
15. May th? glorious example of France tea 1
other nations the value of the blessing, t 0 fa / 01
16. May the enemies of freedom be draWj

pitflure.
17- May the glorious Revolution in France
provoke in Britons the emulation never m
excelled in liberty.
18. May our Representatives be honest and
our people free, so that Britain may nevtr'ftand
in need of another revolution.
The Earl of Stanhope informed the company
that the fragment of the Baftile on the table was
really genuine, and had been presented to the
company for that days solemnity by Mademoiselle
D'Eon.
The reft of the evening was fpenr in the high
est conviviality. We never witnefled a more ani".
niared, or a more rriumphanc display of enthu
fiafin in the cause of freedom. There was a very
large appearance of the true and genuine friends
of libei tyâthe Whigs of Englandâthe men who
were the firft to feel and establish the rights of
men. And wetruft that those of another descrip
tion, who aflifted in this meeting, will be caught
by the fervor of the day, t,o refpedi and cherish ac
home the invaluable blessing which they joined
011 Wednesday in commeinorating, on being ob
tained by others.
