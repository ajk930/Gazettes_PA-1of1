jnnpu.e. l)avila 7 the Catholic and Italian, has
recoided in this place, all the party exagrerati
on of hie mistress and the Guises. He fays, thai
it the petition of the Protestants was severely and
naughtily rejeifted, as it indubitably would be,
they were to march immediately troops alien)-
bled secretly from all the Provinces ; that these
should suddenly appear under different leaders
who should be appointed for them, that finding
the King unguarded and the court without de
fence, they were to 111 aUlicre the duke of Guise
ana the Cardinal ot Lorrain, with all their crea
tui es ; and oblige the King to declare, regent
and lieutenant-general of the kingdom/ the
Prince of Conde, who (hould grant them a cefla
tion of puriifhment and libcity of conscience.
It was believed at the time and publifhcd, thai
the chiefs of the coiifpiracy, had g;iven secret or
ders, it every thing fuccedcd to their v.ilhes, to
put toihe (word the Queen-mother, th&
himfelf, and his brothers, that the croyvn in this
way might descend to the Princes of Bourbon.
LutDayila himfelf acquitsthem of this attrocions
accusation, by adding, that none of the accom
plices having avowed this horrible deflgn, nei
ther when 011 the rack, not of their<own accord,
but all on the contrary having formally denied
it, 1 cannot relate it as a fart. W'e know very
weil that fame, aided bv the vain terrors of the
people, and the malignity of the great, takes a
pleaiurein magnifying objects to infinity.
1 he plan beino; thus concerted among the con
fpiiators, they uivided the provinces and em
ployments, among the principal Culvinifts, that
the execution might be atiended with ns much or
der and secrecy as poflible. Barri, fie la Renau
die aflumed the principal part, and put himfelf
attue head of thÂ« euterprize. This was a person
celebrated tor his travels and adventures. His
wit and courage had acquired him credit among
the Huguenots. He wanted neither fpiric to un
dertake nor vivacity to execute. The disarrange
ment of his fortune had reduced him to the al
ternative of procuring himfelf a better condition
by some daring attempt, or of terminating his
misfortunes by a sudden death. Although ift'ued
from the firft nobility of Perigord, lie had wan
dered long in different countries, and had at
length taken refuge in Geneva, where by his
lubulty he had acquired some consideration.
Such was the birth and character of the principal
leader of the conspiracy, who was soon followed
by a great number of aflociates, some excited by
a zeal for religion, others by the attractions of
novelty, and others limply by that natural inqui
etude, which never permits the French to lan
gaifh in idleness.
La Renaudie confided to the chiefs among them,
the care ot afleuibling their partizans and con
duffing then) to the rendezvous. The intelli
gence with which he diltributed provinces, intro
duced tt kind of order into this confufion. Caf

tany : all famous lor courage, diffinguifhed bv
their Uobilitv, and considered in their cities and
cantoiH, as iii-ads of the party. These fat-liona
i ics, after having aiienibled at Nantes, a city of
Brittany, fotne under the pretext of a lawsuit,
and others under that of a marriage, repaired
with grejt diligence to the polls which were af

This motion was seconded with a further de

count, for having f&ved the Hate."
The Marquis de la Fayette replied, "We

A deputation was introduced of 863 conque

These brave fellows, finding that the honorable

June 19PHfLOSOPHICAL REFLECTIONS
ON THE LAII
REVO L.UT I O N I N FRANCE, ire.
C ON TIXUAT lON,
THE moll means fliould be inftamly
pursued to chock this growing niifchief ;
and perhaps rtorre eoold'btf better than re-ellab
lilhing the obsolete practice of ifluing geiteral
warrants, at the discretion of the Secretary of date.
If there lhuuld ilill remain anyabfurd prejudices
again (I the name, let them be callcd lettres de ca
chet. A late eminent inagiitijate recommended
the adoption of this measure, with great force of
reasoning, and nnanfvverable argument, in order
to check the migration of our manufacturers, and
and the export of our fj>inning-ieH>iys ; but now
the French revolution, and the wife extension of
our excise laws, have made it not only prudent,
but absolutely neceflary for the preservation of
the empire. The present member for Middlesex
has a glorious opportunity of making the amende
honorable to his king, country, and conitituents,
by bringing in a bill to legalize general warrants,
or lettres de cachet. Let the commons pais it, and
the lords will not venture to throw it out. The
lin ing menaces of the tobacconilts, in their evi
dence, may firve as a preamble to the art ; and
a special clause may be inserted to suspend the
pernicious operation of ,ihe habeas corpus art for
seven years; and at the end of that time it will
be totally forgot
In (hort, the expediency of llrengthening the
arm ofexecuiive power is universally admitted ;
and as we have hitherto derived all our riches,
and happiness, by keeping up a cordial
enmity, and provoking rivalfhip bet ween us and
France, by a total diversity of laws, opinions, and
conltitution ; let us still, with patriotic pertina
city, adhere to our old fyftein, and we may yet
bid defiance to all our enemies, foreign and do
mestic. On this principle, the following hints
may be of use.â
Let the whole of the British revenue be farm
ed to that great comptroller of finance, Monf. C.â
Let a royal imprimatur be eftabliihsd ; (nibbling
at the newspapers, by forbidding them to be hut,
is a nagatory policy ;) let both honfesof convo
cation meet ro recommend lotteries, and his Ma
jofty's proclamation for the reformation of man
ners ; let them appoint a committee, (Doctor H.
in the chair) lo cite, degrade), and deprive such
of the clergy of their benefices who fliall prefunle
to iuppor: any of the present members of tlia
lioule of commons, at the next:generAl eleiitioh,
â who voted for a repeal of the tell acft'; let them
examine, and'fentence to the flames, all publica
tions of an immoral tendency, and commit the
-authors, printers, and readers to NpwgAte ; let
the schism bill, which expired 011 the lft of Au
gull 1714, be revived ; let the authority of the
bilhops' court be extended, and no appeal allow
ed from their decisions, except to heaven. Some
thing of this fort has been already done, jufl fuf
ficient to provoke the animadversions of Doctor
Price ; and what more can be said in praile of
adininiltration ?
Even you, Sir, mud acknowledge that I spread
nofalfe alarms, when we are at this moment me
naced with a restoration of the. pagan divinities.
The Pantheon may receive the gods of Greece
and Rome; and perhaps we may fee tlie worftiip
which has been very lately abolilhed at Ilernia,
revived at Ranelagh. Our youth are early ini
tiated into the niylteries of the heathen mytlio
logy, and have too ftronga propensity to kneel at
the flirine of Venus, and pour out libations to
Bacchus. In (liort,the revolution in France, the
spirit of the diflenters, and the licentious wish
of a platonicphilofopher, ftrikc me with the ut
molt horror. The approaching calamities of
Britain lie heavy on my heart. At all events, I
ihall endeavor to aftSvith fortitude and refigna
lion :
" Such inthofc moments, asinthepaft,
44 O save my country, Heaven, (hall be my lift.'
But a con fide ration of the utmost importance
yet remains. The dangerous revolt of the mili
tary, on whom the liability and glory of the
French monarchy rested, hasexcited my indigna
tion, and almo'ii driven me to despair. if i'ol
diers once presume to consider themselves as ci
tizens, to enter into any difculfion and distinc
tions on this invidious fubjeft, there will be no
life in keeping up those large Handing armies, to
which modern governments owe their brilliancy
and power.âNo similar instance has happened
tince the year 1688. " James drew out his ar
my," fays Lord Bolinbroke, " but in vain, for
it was an EngTifli one 1 " Louis did not draw out
his army, for it was 110 longer a French one !
/ind thus "kings have been deserted, and deliver
ed up into the hands of their revolted fubje<fts,
rÂ»nd a fatal revolution brought about in France
and England, by the (hanieful defection of the
troops. But an extension of the evil is (till to be
dreaded, and has already taken efFecft. Papers,
called le SoLiat Patrhtiqfrt, are di("perled among
the military 011 the continent, exciting the pri
vates of every battalion to mutiny;* and taunt
ingly alklnc tlieai, whether they are not degra
dtd, by fubmittinjjj to the caprice of puerile aris
tocrats, who are wifely commiflioned by their lo
vereign to drill and chaltife thein ififp military
discipline, by the magical effects of a rattan ?â
These inflammatory addrefles have already had
fucti a fatal operation, that -I 1 queft'ion whether a
German pritics could now induct his troops, by
double pay, to fulfil acoutrasÂ«ft with us or Spain,
if the flame of rebellion should spread to her co
lonies in South America, or to the Isle of Man.
On the whole, Sir, 1 own myfelfterrified at the
very idea of innovation. The fermentation of
democracy, begun in Frajice, may extend here,
and excite a fatal change in our tempers and dis
positions Your pliilofophical pursuits incline
you to be less tremblingly apprelienfive ; you
falfely conclude from analogy, that our conftitu-
tion inay be improved by impregnating it with a
new principle, as yok have given common water
the spirit and flavor of Pyrmont, by a lucky in
fulioii of fixed.air. But the ancients were wife
ly, and evcu timidly circumfpe&on this eflentia'
point of p -licy. '1 he kings and ephori of Spar
tahave jultly Merited and obtained tliepraifesof
all poilerity, for ifluing a deeree again ft Timo
theus, and fining liirn, tor adding another ltring
to the harp. Th#fe profound judges of human
nature in It ant ly -perceived that thelawsand con-
Ititutions ofLycurgus would soon be defpiled,
and rendered oblblete, by the wanton vibrations
excited in [he ears of their sober and uncorrupt
ed youth, by this uuconftitutional string. They
exprelsly fay, " He has given to our music an ef
feminate and artificial dress, inilead of the plain
and orderly one in which it has hitherto appear
ed ; rendering melody infamous, by compoiing
in the chromatic, inilead of the enharmonic. Be it
therefore enadted, by the authority aforefaid,
that Timotheus be baiiifhecl from our city, that
men may be warned for the future not tj intro
duce any innovation into Sparta !"
1 only quote this very Angular historical anec
dote, to convince our felf-opinionated, lceptical
reformers, that nothing was deemed trifling by
ihe wil'dom of antiquity,which could in the flight
ed degree tend to any alteration in the govern
ment.
In the pvefent wiklnefs of political speculation
in Fiance, 1 should not be l'urprifed if some de
claiming demagogue proposed the eating of raw
flefh, a ia mode d' Aiyjjinie, in order to keep up the
rage and violence of the commons in unabated
vigor. An aift of the National Aflembly (conlt
deringtheir unhappy influence) would soon make
thiÂ» lavage custom fafhionable, under the falla
cious pretence of reducing the price of wood;
and rendering one article of the commercial
treaty of no effect, by preventing the importa
tion of coals. This barbarous nutriment would
soon be relished here, as we have always had a
propensity to that lort of food ; and would in
fallibly produce every atrocious act of ferocity
which has already desolated that devoted land.
As the paflions, taite and appetites, principal
ly originate from the physical properties of our
diet, our -virtues and vices may be traced to the
fame source, and improved, or counteracted, by
a moral, regimen, fhis fentiinent is neither new
nor paradoxical ; it has been already elucidated
with philosophic truth and poetieal* beauty, by
one of our elegant and plealing poets :
" Was e*Â«r Tartar fierce or ciuel
" Upon the ftrengthof walcr gruel ?
" But who (hall Hand his rage and force,
" If fir 11 he rides, then eats Ins horse."
The cruelty or mildness of animals depends 011
their either being graminivorous or carnivorous ;
man, by his dignified nature, enjoys the option
al privilege of being either ; but as he isalfo dif
tinguiflied by enjoying the superior faculty of
ctokiug, the direful effects of a raw-fleih diet is
counteracted by this humane refinement. The
Hindoos are meek, gentle, uncommonly patient,
and fubinit to every ast of extortion and rapine'
with aftonilhing composure, and the mod lauda
ble resignation. Our countrymen, who, by their
travels and indefatigable researches, have acqui
red a perfect and accurate knowledge oflndoftan
all agree (however they may differ on other
points) in giving the natives this very amiable
character, and universally ascribe it to their Am
ple vegetable diet. This phyficai principle is so
well understood, that the fighting cajh are com
pelled to eat flefli, as aneflenrial part of military
discipline ; otherwise they would soon lose their
courage and the esprit de corps, and meanly degen.
ernte into tlic tsiiicncls of mere citizcns.
I could adduce Itrong reasons for throwing out
tins alarming hint, and have now in my poflfef
flon letters from a leading member of the Nation
al Assembly, to prove that this horrid scheme is
in agitation. The vanity of Frenchmen induces
them to think, that as they have long given the
ton, en fait de manger, the 1110 ft aristocratic peo
ple m Europe (even Spaniards and Germans)
will soon eat themselves into a republican fren
zy, as they will be Simulated Toy a frefh incentive
at every meal. This is the favorite project of
our reltlefs and ambitious rivals at present who
a flatter themselves with the hope of
edabljflnng a shocking system of universal demo
582
ciacy, by this infambus expedient. Our bed
preservative, infuch an emergency, would be a
genera] man of the ri*ht&
and privileges of a citizen, besides fubjeftinr
Him to a fine, at the discretion of the judges, and

wardens of exacft compii.
ance with the obligatory clauses of the said ua
to wit, " That A. or B. had duly and regularly
eaten his fieih or filh, either boiled, roalted ba

ded, that you, Sir, and your brethren, the difleu
ters, would still remain stubborn and refradtory
and fadtioufly coipplain of this salutary reltrainr'
as a new grievance, and again expatiate on the

r ~T~ , HE hnufc having agreed to insert ftvtn years in lieu of
X infilled on by the S.-nate, as the time at the expiration of
which, mtercllon the deferred part of the debt fhouldcommeuc-â¢
it was moved that the house should recede.
Tliis motion was opposed by Mr. Lawrance, Mr. Gerry, and
Mr. Ames ; Mr. Sherman, Mr. V'ltzliitions, Mr. Slone and' Mr
Sedgwick, supported the motion.
Mr. Ames observed that it gave him great fatisfaaion when he
reflettcd that the house through the lopj; difcuffionof this lmpgr
taut fubjrft had difcoveied an uniform uifpfcfuiou to fnppon i n
public faith ; not an inflance m our contitifl I believe (laid hrj
has occurred, through the whole conrfe of this buGnct at which
we have cause to blufb ; this firninefs and conliftency has re
flected the giealcfl honor on thehoufcâand I would fondly hop
lavs a happv foundation for the public mind to reft upon. He
then offeied some general oblcrvations on the immutability a
public justice, the facredncfs of public comrafliâand apply nig
the principles to the proportion of the Senate infilled that it was
a manifeft and glaring violation of the tiontraft between the go

the S. nate have agreed to the rate ol redemption, viz. 8 pi. cent,
pr. annum, agreeable to th: lirfl part of the amendment propof.d
by the House : the time lor the commencement of intcicft, seven
years, ought to follow of course.
He then shewed (he operation of the proportion adopted by the
Senate, and by calculations he had made, it would, he faitl, de
prive the creditors of 18 pr. cent, of their deferred capin;.' Uc.
â¢nlarged 011 the present and piobable rate of inteteft, and from
t,i iousdcduÂ£lions he Ihcwcd'.hatth. original piopofiuonittthe Se
crctary's report was more consonant to justice than any fubllnute
which had been offered ; and as that which the house had agreed
to deviated lei's from it than that modified by the Senate, he ho
ped for these and other reasons, which he offered, tint the house
would not recede, but infill on their amendment, and requefl a
confer en cc.
Mr. Sedgwick said that the fubjeft now before the house wa*
of all others the mod important, and that about which men
of the! moll pure intentions might be supposed most to differ, with
out the imputation of improper motives. To this body was refer
red the important and arduous task of providing for an iiumeu/a
debt, to do this in such manner as to give fatisfa&ion, an infinite
variety of circumstances attending the creation of the debt, and
what had been the operations with and upon it, were to be con
templated. The house had not only to determine what thev ouÂ§hi
to do, but they were also to guess what they could do.âWhat
were the resources of the country, and the abilities of the govern
ment under th':fe circumstances ? He feared that the speculations
of the clofct, had produced fvftems, which prevented a spirit of
accommodation and conceflion, which he believed was never more
necessary. He besought gentlemen to reflcdt, that the utmost de
gree of certainty they could obtain that they were light, was a
eonje&urcthat they were so. Under these circumstances, he hoped
that gentlemen would companionate the circumftanccs of their
country ; he begged them to reflect that the commcrciai capital of
this country was diverted to objects not only unproductive of any
benefit to the community, but deftruÂ£live of its moil important
inter ells ; that the paftion of avarice, the most fordid of any which
can possess the human heart, was now raging to a pitch, of which
the history of our country afforded no precedent. Men not only
fpcculated in the funds, but they gambled even in contracts of
speculation ; bargains refpefting the debt were fold in the market
almost as frequently as the debt iifelf.âHe aficed if it v. as not the
duty of every good man to exert himfclf to relieve this country
from the effects of this unhappy situation. He observed that the
difference In value between the provision proposed by the Senate,
and that heretofore adopted by the House, was about one twelfth
pait. lempcrate reflection he believed would prevent on thu ac
count one moment's pertinacious adherence to the conjectural cal
culations of the house.
Mr. Sedgwick said that his colleague (Mr. A.) had jealously
contended that the amendment of the Senate was a departure
from principleâthis he did not understand to be the cafe. The
Secretary had attached to his proposition so- which this was a fub
lutute, a quality of irredeemability ; the house had varied this
propofitionâtht Senate have done the fame. Whether any or
which of these calculations Were right, no gentleman could with
cei tainty predict. They are dependant on future events, known
only to that being who had the fupremc controul of them. He
never could comprehend how this irredeemability, the worftquali
ty m the opinion of the people of this country annexed to the
terms of the loan, could justly be considered as an equivalent for
that part of the debt of which the creditor was to bedeprived for it.
Notwithstanding he had always considered this as a principle un
derflood by few, and desired by noneâyet from a disposition to
accommodate to the opinions of others, he had acceded to it;
because without such a spirit of accommodation, every effort to
effett the funding of the debt, would be found vainand ineffectual.
âHe wished other gentlemen would be equally disposed to con
ciliate ; and he had no doubt but a majority would ; for he would
not fuppofc that they would endanger the loss of the accorn
plifbment of the great business we had so long and painfully la
bored to effeCtâbecaufe a majority in the other house, who had an
equal right with them to think and aÂ£l for themfelvcs, were not
disposed io resort la their ftandaid of truth.

IN .LW-YORK, September 4,
Slanders on private chafers arejuftly and universally reproba
ted : How much more ought unfounded aspersions on public bo
dies, or characters, to meet wiih general detestation !
Ii is the glorious privilege of freemen to think what they please
and to publish their (entiments with freedom and decency on all
fubjefts, with which their intercft is conneaed ; but it is an high
insult 10 the majesty of the people, to traduce those characters that
their free fuffrages haveekfted to public stations.
While a free pr< fs is an objrtf of sacred regard to an enlightened
people, a press that teems with lies and (lander , either thro ignor
ance or design in the ennduftor of it, is to be execrated as a pell!-
lent engine of mis hies.
Sychophants are of vanou* iptions : There are sycophants

viduals, whose fmil sor frowns, or preftnt sentiments, however
variant or contradiftorv to former dfclarations, are the directory
of their faith and pr?&i ; fychophants of opinion are those,

merchantmen, coming home from Spain, were
wrecked upon them, and only Miles Bifliop, with
John and Henry Clarke, were preserved on the
fragment of a malt. Hence the appellation took
its rife.
' Thanks to the constitution of the government
under which we live, that the liberty even of the
Jovvell fubjedt ihall no more be invaded -with im
punity than that of the highelt.âA verdict was
lately'given againltthe Mayor of Londonderry for
illegally imprisoning a poor man five days. Da

The art of making perukes was invented at Pa
ris,about the end of the reign of Lewis Xlll,and
people then gave over the use of Calottes orna
mented with a double row of hair, quite ltraight
or frizzed. The Abbe la Riviere firlt let the ex
ample : His peruke weighed two pounds. These
head drelles were heavy, and of an enormous size,
until i 630, when the Sieur Ervais devised a me
thod of curling the hair. Perukes then became
real ornaments, and seemed to baniflx the marks
of oivi age.
Antimony, the remedy so celebrated, was dis
covered by a German monk, named Basil Valen
tine, who, searching for the philosopher's (tone,
and having thrown to the hogs what remained
after some of his experiments, oblerved, thatthofe
who swallowed it, after being violently purged,
became much fatter. He took it into hishead to
make a trial of it upon some of his brother monks ;
but, as the dose was too ltrong. they all died.
Hence comes the name of antimoine in French,
â which has been given to this mineral fubltance.
Burying grounds were not eftabliflied until
the year 200. People before were interred in the
highways, and ancient tombs are Itill to be seen
011 the roads leading to Rome. Hence these
words, so often repeated in epitaphs, Sta victor :
Stop traveller.
In 1474, the physicians and surgeons of Paris
represented to Louis XI. that several people of
diltinftion were afflicted with the Itone, and that
it would be of the highelt utility to anatomy to
examine, in a living fubjetft, that part of the hu
man body which is the feat of this disorder. They
therefore requelted his majesty, that he would
order a person, named Franc Archer, who had
been fubjeifc to this malady, and who was con
demned to be hanged, to be delivered into their
hands. This being granted, the firlt operation
of cutting for the stone was performed publicly
at Paris, in the burying ground of St. Severin.
The criminal was completely cured in the space
of a foitnight, and obtained, besides his pardon,
a coniiderable reward. We cannot here help ob
serving, that this is a striking instance of the vi
ciflitudes of life, flnce, to be cured ot his disorder,
it was necedary that this unhappy man should be
condemned to the gallows.

THE ANSWER.
TO THE CLERGY OF THE TOWN OF NEWPORT IN THE
STATE OF RHODE-ISLAND.
Gentlemen,
THE salutations of the Clergy of the town of Newport, on my
arrival in the State of Rhode-Island, are rendered the more
acceptable, on account of the liberal sentiments andjuft ideas which
they are known to entertain refpetting civil arÂ«d icligious liberty.
I am inexpreflibly happy, that, by the smiles of Divine Provi
dence, my weak but well-meant endeavors to feive my country,
have hitherto been crowned with so much success, and apparently
give such fatisfattion to those in whose caufc they were exerted.
The fame benignant influence,'together with the concurrent sup
port ot all real Iriends to their country, will still be neceflary to
enable m<s to be in any degree ufcful to this numerous and free
people, over whom I am called to preside.
Wherefore I return you, Gentlemen, my hearty thanks for your
foleinn invocation of Almighty God, /that every temporal and
spiritual blcfling may be dispensed to me; and that, under my
adminiflration, the families of these States may enjoy peace and
prosperity, with all the bleflings attendant on civil and religious
liberty.âln the participation of which bleflincrs may you have an
ample fhuic. GEO. WASHINGTON.
