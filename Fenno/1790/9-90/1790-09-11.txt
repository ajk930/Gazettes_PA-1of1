FROM THE (LONDON) POLITICAL MAGAZINE.
CHARACTER OF DR. FRANKLIN.
TT'EVV men have gained universal celebrity from
Ji- fucli an origin. The principal conductor of
the American Revolution, had been a journey
man Printer in Philadelphia. Such are the def
tinatiotis of that Providence, which lias ordained
the production of an oal: from an acorn.
IDr. Franklin came to London in 1726. The
love of science can be tiaced from this early pe
riod, though he appeared here in the line of his
business. He had procured letters to, and was
well received by Mr. Koikes,afterwards President
of the lloySl Society, and through him knew Dr.
Clark. He was not,however, gratified with a fight
of his friend, which he often lamented, and which
he had labored to obtain : great age and increas
ing infirmities prevented an introduction to Sir
I. Newton.
Of his origin lie made no fecrer. In a conver
sation at Paris, in company with the Compte
D'Aranda, and the Duke de la Rochefoucalt, he
replied to an Irifli Gentleman,who had aiked him
fcnne queitions about Americ'a, and particularly
about the state of the paper manufactory there,
lew men can give you more information on that
subject than in y fie If, for 1 was originally in the
printing trade.
The princi]>les and qualities of Electricity were
scarcely known in the lalt age. The Eledlric
Fluid was barely mentioned at the end of New
ton's opticks. It was reserved for Mr. Franklin
to investigate its properties, and of that branch
of science he may be confidefed as the father.
Theory was advanced to practice and utility, by
the invention of the Coudud'jr.
Nor were his observations coniined to this sci
ence. There were few fubjeiTts of common uti
lity,upon which he did not comment; none which
lie did not improve and illultrate ; of which his
advice to Servants ; to Tradesmen 5 to Settlers in
America ; on the cure of Suioaky Chimnies ;
'Rules for Clubs and for Conversation ; Maxims
to convert a Great into a small Empire, written
with the cauitic spirit of Swift, abundantly prove.
To be generally ufeful, that he might be univer
sally celebrated, seemed to be his ruling princi
ple.
The memories of the aped are now supposed to
be retentive. The truth, however, seems to be,
that the tablet of the memory becomes callous at
a certain period, nor is it susceptible of new im
preHions, and particularly of verbal knowledge.
Franklin was an exception to this rule : he ac
quired French after seventy ; he spoke fluently
and even fcientifically in that language.
In fociery he was sententious, but not fluent, a
liftner rather than a talker, an informing, rather
than a pleallng companion ; impatient of inter
ruption, he often mentioned the custom of the
Indians, who always remain silent lome time be
fore they give an answer to a quelHon, which
they have heard attentively, unlike fonie of the
polite{t societies in Europe, where a sentence can
scarcely be (iniflied without an interruption.
It is a testimony to truth, and bare justice to
his memory, that he used hi 3 utmost endeavors
to prevent a breach between England and Ame
rica. His Parliamentary examination in 1766â
itil his converfaiions till 1775, had the fame be
nign tendencyâHad his councils been followed
ho would have proved a friend indeed to this
country. From the period cf the well known
aSo ft* before the Council, he entertained a moil
ardent refentnient, too often the cxcrefence of
great minds. Folitenefs and moderation Could
not restrain the most pointed and bitter sarcasms
againli the conducft of England in mixed compa
nies ; and it is remarkable, that when the (hip
in which he failed lalt to America had tQUchtd
at Portfmonth, he was requelted t<r refVefh hini
felfon shore ; but he declined it, faying he was
refolved never more'to set his foot upon Engliih
ground.
The testimonies of Franklin's merit were con
ceived in the highelt strain of penegyrick : In
the year 1777, Lord Chatham adverted, in a re
markable speech, to his forcible arguments
against the war, and to the sagacious advice of
the American Newton.
Upon his reception in the French Academy,
D. Alemberr, the friend and correspondent of
Frederick the Great, welcomed him with that
well known line which revived the boldness and
the sublimity of Lucan.

NATIONAL ASSEMBLY OF FRANCE.
Saturday, June 19.
A LETTER was read from M. Necker to the
Alleinbly, informing them, that the repub
lic of Geneva had supplied the territory of Gex,
(which was in great want) with 1400 quintals of
corn, on condition of having the fame quantity
returned them a few months after the harvelt.
M. Neckir added, that the Genevoi? had taken
that opportunity of renewing their offer of a pa
triotic donation to the state. This generous
proposal of a neighboring ftate,the ally of F ranee,
was warmly applauded, and ordered to be record
ed in the minutes. Some other offers of a similar
nature were afterwards made by fonie individuals
in the canton of Berne
M. Nouriffart, from the Committee ofFinances,
moved, that the Aflembly fliould anthorife the
CaiHed'Efcompte to pay into the public treasury
thirty millions of nÂ»tes.
M. Camus rose and obierved, that altho he did
not mean to oppose this motion, he thought that
the utmolt precaution (herald be taken that the
national treasure should not be improvidently
squandered, and that an exa<si account should be
rendered of the expenditure.âThis, heobferved,
had not lately been the cafe ; for the estimate
of the expence of the royal houfhold, for tlie firft
four mouths of the prelent year, was rated at
8,380,000 livrcs, whereas the futn aiftually paid
had b-en only 4,500,000 livres. He then Hated
fevcral fiinilar inttayres, and remarked upon the
impropriety of allowing the annual accounts to
lie over unsettled for so longa period, as from the
year 1775, to 1783. He cited the example of
Lewis XIV, who, at the end of every month, au
dited, with his own hand, M. Colbert's account of
the finances. He concluded his speech by propo
sing a plan of a decree to authorise the Caifle d'
Efcompte to pay in the sum moVed for to the
Royal Trcafury, and 10 effeel several other pur
poses of economical i cgtilations.
M. di Caiitclar then rose, and entered into a
vindication of the condu<ft of the Committee of
finances, and M. N~cker. He said their 1-abors
had been imnienfeâ3nd that in a little time they
would be at an end.
The Abbe Maury then rose, and uttered the most
bitter complaints agdinlt M. Necker, for not com
plying with hisrequifition of producingthe three
accounts he had called for, viz. The expehceâ
the receiptâthe public debt. He said, although
the Minister had not had time to produce these
accounts, he had found time to write pamphlets
againlt hiiu. After the Abbe had -vented his ill
luimour in a number of (atirical observations up
on the Minister, he, all at once, surprised and
alarmed the Aflembly, byadvaneinga very hein
ous charge ogainft him. lie aflerted that M.
Necker had made a concealment of 600 millions
of livres. It was supposed that the Abbe would
hardly have brought forward an accusation of
this nature without some ground, the Afleinbly
were of courie conliderably agitated. The Ab
be in the mean time went on, and condemned in
very pointed terms the statements on the finan
ces lately submitted.by M. Necker to the Afl'ein
bly. He was equally severe upon those publiih
ed by M. Necker's two immediate predeceffbrs,
M. de Calonne, and the Arclibifhop of Sens, all
of which he alferted to be falfe, and abounding
in omillions and errors.
M. Regnault rose, and moved thar the memoir
and di (course the Abbe had juit delivered, (hould
be printed for the use of the members. This
Motion parted unanimously. Tlie Abbe was then
desired to deposit liis discourse at the table.
f his he refufed, and finding that this request was
likely to be infilled oil, he made a precipitate re
treat from the Hall, and the Assembly recalled
their order for printing it, and decreed that the
( aide D'Efcompte Ihould pay into the public
I realury 30 millions of their notes.
M. 3ouc!)s read a letter from Avignon, by
590
which It appeared, that the people hart com.
pleatly annihilated Papal tyranny and fuperUi.
tion in that country. The Ecclesiastics kept
their hold as long as pofiible, but were at laii:
compelled to yield ; and had it not been for the
efforts of the National Guard?, fonie of the moil
obnoxious would have been hanged. The peo
ple were in the greatest joy at being re-united to
France, andmolt of the Aritlocratics havino-] e ft
the country, peace and tranquility univerfaliy
prevailed.
MONT> AY, JUN 1" 2 [
M. Voulland rose, and gave amoli: melancholy
relation offonie late tumults in the ciry ot'Nif.nes
In this city the Aviftocratics have a strong party
which they have been at pains to strengthen by
every polhble means. On the igthinft. the dra
goons, who had refufed to afl'ociate with the re
giment ufGuienne, for the fafeguard ofthe ciry,
appeared in the streets with white cockades in
their hats. This conducfl gave rife to a tumult.
They were insulted in all parts ofthe city, and
M. Boudon loit his life. On the day following,
the patriots lhut thelnfelves up in the fort, and
being besieged by the dragoons, the place was ta
ken by rtorm, and a hundred persons peri/lied in
the atiault. In another part of the city a funilar
Icene of bloodlhed took place between the patriots
and their adversaries, and among the Wain were
found a number of Capuchi/is. It is ftronglyfuf
pe<fted that this horrid maflacre had been pre
vioully meditated, the greatelt part ofthe officers
of the dragoons having been provided with dou
ble charges of powder and fliot, above the usual
allowance. It is alio suspeCted that the Munici
pal officers were engaged. Two of thefeare ap
prehended, and the other has made his-efcape.
The Aflembly, in consequence of this relation,
immediately palled a decree, inverting the King
with authority to continue the powers of the com.
miflaries for the eftablilhment of the ad mini lira
tive Alleinblies of the department of Gar, and to
charge them to do their utmost to maintain peace
and good order in the city, and to call in the af
filtance ofthe National Militia, and other mili
tary corps if neceflary, and declaring the Munici
pality ofNifmes deprived for a time of that part
oftheir functions.
A celebrated artilV having presented 10 the
Afiembly a fine bull of M. Roulleau ; it was im.
mediately placed opposite to where those of
Franklin and Washington were intended to be
fixed. The resemblance is striking.and ftrong'y
expreflive of the genius and misfortunes of that
great man.
Wednesday, June S3.
The business of moment this day in the Mem -
bly, was a debate on the provision to 1m fettled
on the dignified Clergy nowcxiiling.â Mr Tliou
ret proposed a plan of a decree on a fcmewhat
larger scale than that of the Committee :âThe
following articles were ultimately decreed.
Art. I. From the fiilt of January, 1790, the
provilion to Archbilhops and Sifhopsnowexifting;
(hall be as follows, viz. Tliofe whose revenues
do not exceed 12,000 livres, ihall remain as they
are
11. Those whole revenues exceed that sum to
a certain extent, shall enjoy 15,000 livres ; bat
the maximum is fixed at 30,000livres, theArck
biihop of Paris only accepted, who shall have
75,000 livres.
111. The Aarchbifnops and Bishops shall conti
nue, as usual, to enjoy the pofleffion of their hou
ses and gardens, situated in their Episcopal Ci:y
ov Suburbs.

" The National Afl'embly, confidenng that the

of giving life to industry and agriculture, of in

The late Decree in favor of the Conquerors of

haps greater than either. This Commandant of
the National Guards is highly esteemed by the
Parisians, and he deserves ro be so, as no doubt
the tranquility of the dry is much owinjr to his
judicious exertionsâFor these ten days past a
perfect calm has reigned at Paris ; but the Pro
vinccs are far from being equally quiet. In Ie
Chatoloisa number of levellers have endeavored
to eltabl.ih an agrarian law, and when the ac
counts came away, had already began to maik
out the landed property. At Lyons the populace
have hung a young man who was detected pick
nig pockets, with the handkerchiefs he had jutt
before ltolen. At Nantz, in Brittany, there lias
alio been a tumult, in which several persons
were killed and wounded .-âAnd at B.iyoime,
three ofthe National Guard have been aflair.nai

ings, iho 111 (mailer numbers, at Dejon, Auxerre,
&c. Nevertheless, there is still a very confideâ¢'
ble number of enemies of the revolution called
Anftocratics ; many more indeed, than there
were in the firft moment ofenthufiafm, that over
turned the old government. This 1 conceive
may be attributed to several reasons.âMany be
gin to feel and repent the facrificcs they made in
the momentary fervor of patiiotifm ; many
others who offered to make them, are disappoint
ed by those offers being accepted. All thole who
wish tb fhengthen equivocal titles to nobility are
ariltocratics ; and all who desire to find an ex
cuse for not iubferibing to the patriotic contribu
tion, pi-offer themselves so whether they are or
not. It is the number of these persons that con
tributes to spread through Europe the lo(id cries
against the measures of the National AfTembly,
and to make the world believe, that the present
ills by which France is afÃidied proceed from their
operations, rather than f.om the former vicious
form of government, though upon a fair enquiry
it fhonhl i'eem that the contrary is the cafe
" There is a noble paflage in M. Necker's late
men:ol ial to the Narional Aflembly, that may
merit trie attention of the makers of penal laws,
and of juries who decidi on life and death.
" Who, fays he, " fliall dare to determine the
value of tlie life of a single man who falls a vic

no known l ules to go by, nor do I know that

country u brought into comparison with Great Britain, there is
perhaps no circumftjucc which (hews the relative character of the
two countries in a flrotijjer light, than the number of criminals
that are executed in each. If m that country there are, for exam

DISCOURSES ON DAVILA.
NO. XIX. âCONCLUDSD.
Mais fun etl'autre Guifc out eu moins de fcrupulc.
chcfs ambiticuK d'un peuple trop credulc,
Couvrant leurs mterets de l'inteiet des cieux
Out conduit dans le piegc un pcuple furieux.
EAGLE EYÂ£D, high foal'd ambition, feldam
mifles its opportunity. TheGuife3 refolvcd
to profit of a conjuncture so advantageous to ce
ment and increase their power, by causing the
fall of ilieir rivals to promote their own eleva
tion, as poisons are sometimes, by uncommon
(kill converted into remedies. They entered the
King's apartments, without the knowledge of the
Queen, affecting with terror to exaggerate the
danger; they declared all was reported to be plot
ted again ft: the government, his molt faithful fub
jetfts, and his royal person. They remonstrated
to him, that the danger was imminent, that the
confpiraiors were already atthe gates of Amboife,
â with forces much more formidable and numer
ous than had been fufpeifted. Finally they de
manded orders, the promptitude and energy of
which fhpuld be proportioned to the grandeur
and proximiiy of the danger. The King, na
tSwrally timid as well as weak, and at this moment
foicibly ltricken with the greatness of the dan
ger which threatened liini, ordered the Queen,
and all his ministers to be called, toconfult on the
means proper to repress the impetuosity of so vio
lent a rebellion. Nothing was seen on all fides
but fubjetfts of terror : Every measure that was
Jjropofed appeared hazardous. The Cardinal of
Lorrain exhausted all his artifices and all his elo
quence to exaggerate the danger and increase the
irrefolntion. The king incapable of deciding,
and of fuilaining the weight of government in
tircumftances so critical, nominated, of his own
mcie motion, the Duke of Guise, his Lieutenant
General, with full and compleat authority. He
added, that not feeling himfelf adequate to art,
lie abandoned to the prudence and valor of the
Duke, the conduct of his kingdom, and the care
of appealing the troubles which agitated it.
Catharine, although Ihe felt an indignation at
this bold attempt, could not oppose it, without
an'open rupture with the Guises, in a moment
when the fafety of the State depended on their
union. She perceived the occasion there was for
a Chief, whose experience and reputation might
take place of the imbecility and irresolution of
the king, as likely to enervate the courage of his
own troops,as to increafethe insolence of his ene
mies. Monafchs the most abfolate, and even re
publics the tnoft jealous of their liberty, had of
ten conferred the fupremc authority on a iimple
man, when the greatness of dangers had appear
ed to require a refburce so extraordinary. Be
sides these views, which regarded the preserva
tion of her son and his States, she forefaw the
carnage, which could ;iot fail to be made, and
that the hatred of the Princes of the blood, and
the enmity of the people would fall necefiarily
on the Duke of Guise commanding alone, with
an absolute authority.
The integrity of the Chancellor Olivier, was
dill an obstacle ; little fatisfied that an autho
rity so unlimited fliould be granted to a subject,
he appeared to suspend hisjudginent. His credit
and firmnefs might have prolonged, ifnot defeat
ed the liicafure. The Queen Mother however
determined him, by alledging, that as soon as the
storm fliould be diflipated, they might restrain
hy new edids and frefh declarations the excelfive
power to be given to the Duke, and confine him
within the bounds of duty and reason ; that it
was the iniereft of all, that the effufion of blood
fliould be done by the l'ole orders of the Duke,
â¢and that neither the King, his relations, or mi
nisters, fliould appear to dip their hands in it.
The Chancellor persuaded by these reflexions,
lealcd thecominiffion, giving to the Duke of Guise
the title and authority ot Lieutenant General of
the King, in all the provinces and territories of
his obedience, with absolute power, as well in
civil as military affairs.
The Duke as soon as he hail obtained the dig
nity and authority which he had always desired,
turned his attention to suppress the conspiracy.
He made able and soldierlike arrangements for
defending the caille and village of Amboife, and
lent out parties of cavalry as well as infantry to
attack the infqrgenfs. A detail oftheir lkirmifh
es would be as little interesting, as it would be to
the purppfe we have in view. LaÃcnaudie fought
â with a bravery which well became the P rot eft ant
cause, and fell with Pardaillan, his antagonist,
in the combatâthough his soldiers collected in
liajle, could not Hand against veteran troops.â
A Capt. L.igniers, one of the conspirators, terri
iied at thegreatnefs of tbedanger, in the moment
of execution, or stricken with temorfe, or desir
ous of making his court, abandoned his accom
plices, and galloped by another road to Amboil'e.
He detailed to the King and Queen, the quality
and number of the conspirators, the names of their
chiefs, and the roads by which they were ap
proaching. The Prince de Conde was iinmedi
ately put under guard, by order of the king, to
hinder liiiu in any manner from favoring the
enterprise of the insurgents, as heliad pr&fmfed
them* The conspirators in fine were defeated
and dispersed. Some perished in the flames of
the houses to which they fledâothers weie han
ged upon the trees in the neighbourhood, or on
the battlements of the castle. Multitudes were
maflacied in the neighbourhood of Aniboife ; the
loife was covered with dead bodiesâthe blooil
run in streams in the ltreetâand the public pla
ces were filled with bodies hanging on gallows s.
The punishment of these inilerable men, tor
mented by the soldiers, and butchered by execu
tionersâfeverities,which the Guises, thought ne
cellary, became the source of carnage, and of ri
vers of blood, which deluged France for many
years in a' rnoft tragical and deplorable manner.
FROM THE CHARLESTON CITY GAZETTE.
AS there are various accounts refpedtlng Mr.
M'Gillivray, the famous Chief of the
Creek Indians, the following iliort flcetch may
be depended on, it being related by one of his
old fchool-fellows About the year 1759, Alex
ander M'Gillivray, then a yonth of 10 years of
age, was sent by his father from the Creek na
tion to this city, and committed to the care ot
Mr.Farquhar M'Gillivray,arelation of his father's
by whom he was placed under the tuition of Mr.
George Sheed, who was then, and now is an emi
nent tnjrli/h master, having adled in that capacity
upwards of forty years in this city, with great re
putation. He was taught the latin language by
Mr. William Henderfon, one of the masters of
the free school, and who was lately one of the
Critical Reviewers in London. At theageof 17,
Mr. M'Gillivray was sent to Savannah, and pla
ced in the counting-house of General Elbertâhe
was afterwards some time in the house of Mellrs
Alexander Ingles and Co. During his apprentice
fliip he was so fond of study that he devoted
much more of his time to reading of liiftory than
tothe acquisition of mercantile knowledge. On
this representation being made to his father, he
was sent for to the Creek nation, since which he
has been raised to his present exalted ftarion, his
countrymen, the Creeks, having chosen him their
king; and his Catholic Majelty, having, it is
said, promoted him to the rank of a Brigadier
General in his service. His letters, which have at
different times been made public, plainly evince
the ltrength of his understandingâand his gener
al character, as a man of undaunted courage and
unblemished integrity, is very generally agreed
on by such as have had the pleasure o'f his ac
quaintance. '
