" It is fane/, not the reason of things, that mates
life so uneasy to us as we find it."
I CAN think of no rule that will determine,
whether the evil or the good we anticipate,be
molt likely to turn out differently from what we
expected. The imagination is equally apt to ex
aggerate in both cases. Excels of fear and anx
iety is not less common, or less foolilh, than the
contrary extremes of hope and complacency.
We are fomuch controled by fancy, and whirled
about by passion, that it is difficult to acquire an
habit, of viewing things according to their real
character, or of regulating our hopes and fears
by any rational standard. Though lam not of
the opinion, that disappointed hopes are a source
of so much pain, as to balance the pleasure result
ing from the indulgence of such hopes, I never
thelel's think that barely to escape the evils we
have dreaded is 110 compensation for having clie
rilhed needlefe, and anxious fears. We are, as
has bfcen before observed, alike liable to meet
with disappointment when we are swayed by fan
cy, either as to objects of good or evil. The im
pulses of hope are lo lively and conllant, that
though they are frequently fallacious, they still
return with frefli vigour and delight. So that up
011 the whole, we may reckon hope as a precious
source of felicity. Nor do I conceive it very de
trimental to happiness, to give wing to the ima
gination in looking for the enjoyment of objects
which we may never attain. The only reltric
tion in thiscafe, is that we do not luffer ourselves
to be so much elevated with alluring prospects,
as to neglect ordinary duties, and to despise ordi
nary occurrences. A sacred regard to support a
clear conscience/and a fair character, will reilrain
the pernicious effects of hope, and make it the
source of much delight, intermingled with little
inconvenience.
But it is far otlierwife with refpeA to fear.
This paifion, though implanted as a natural guard
or forewarner against the various hurtful inci
dents to which we are exposed, becomes a won
ftrous enemy to happiness, when we surrender it
to fancy. If there be any cale, in which reason
fhouldeminently afiunie a sway over the passions,
it is in moderating the excefles of a fearful, anx
ious disposition. 11l health, lots of friends, and
n tholifaud other misfortunes are apt to give a
glooiny caf. ro the mind, and force it into an ha
bit of cheriftiing imaginary evils. By this means,
a fixed melancholy ensues, and a difrelilh for the
innocent enjoyments of life. Wearethus depri
ved of those gratifications which providfcnce puts
in our way, and become the slaves of a servile pas
sion. In this of the fubjetft, we can perceive
the neceflity of examining the reason of things,
when fancy suggests any circumstance that excites
fearful apprehensions. It is true, that it may be
desirable, to have a right view of objects, when
hope is {tiuiulariug ns to acflion, but an error in
this cafe is far less pernicious than an exceJTive
and unreasonable degree of fear. For as evil is
as uncertain as good, it is more eligible to hope
too much of the one, than to fear too much of the
other.
NEW-YORK, September 2_>
r Ky Captain Service, who arrived on Sunday
from St. Peterfburgh, we learn, that a severe
engagement between the Rullian and Swediib
fleets took place off Wyburg the latter end of
June âThat the former had taken and funk five
fail of tUe line and two frigates of the latterâ
The King of Sweden it is said had a narrow ef
eapeYrom being takenâCaptain Service mentions
that there was a rumour of this intelligence at
Cronrtandc before his departure, but when he
torched at Copenhagen he obtained the above
particulars of the evenr.
Ou Saturday lafl arrived here the ship Union,
Capt. Whitlock, in 53 days from Liverpool, which
place he left the 26th of July ; nothing decisive
relative to peace or war had at That time taken
plate,but every thing was in the greatelt prepara
tion. Some days before Capt. Whitlock failed an
Envoy had been sent off from the court of Great
Britain to Madrid, with positive orders to return
vith an explicit answer from the Spanifli mini,
ller, whether his court would accede to the de
mands of Great Britain or not, and that any fur
ther equivocation would be deemed a declarati
on of war. Upwards of twelve hundred leamen
had been imprefled at Liverpool about the mid
dle of July. Amongst these were a number of
Americans, who were, however, released upon
their captains producing the proper tellimonials
of theirxit izenfhip.
We lienr from Rhode-Jfland, that a valuable
addition of cnriofities has been made to the Mu
seum of the college at Providence, by Capt. Jo
seph Ingraham, of Boston, which he hadcolleift
ed at Nooika Sound, and at the .'.andwich
islands. The corporation of the town have vo
ted him rheir sincere thanks, and ordered their
fecrerary to address him on the fubjeci as soon as
pofiible. Avertifer.
PICTURE OP fcEW- YORKâAUGUST W
THE observation is not new,
Bat still tho ancicnt, not less tru?,
That where men cluster thick together,
(Like cackling geese in stormy weather)
Arnidft the din of news and noise,
Some wond'rous theme cach tongue employs 1
Some oae great fubjeft thro the town,
Runs all inferior topics down.
As for example look at London,
Great Britain's heir by debt is undone;
Then poor Mad Peg, with carving knife,
Aims at great George'sâ<o*lâor life â \
A Pig,* or Cat+, as is the fafhion,
Gains the attention of the nation ;
Some boxing-match, to which the Prince
Flies, his great courage to evince ;
Where fomcgieat CobUr maims a Weaver,
Or Butcher fights a iam'd Coal-heaver;
Where bones are broke, and joints are put out,
Where bruises kill, arid eyes are cut out ;
Such glorious themes fill English papers,
Cure English ladies of the vapours ;
Nay, ot such consequence are grown,

REMARKS ON THE ENGLISH LANGOAGE.
DRi Franklin remarks, that in modern times,
notice and advocate are become verbs ; a man
advocated a certain meafnre ; 1 noticed his argti.
menrs. It is doubrlefs true that the life of these
words as vet ht is modern ; but 1 queltion the pro
priety of dilcarding this use of them, iri this I
(honld differ even from so refpetlable an autho*'
rity as Dr. Franklin; altho 1 entirely concur with
him that progress nfed as a verb, is both " abom
inable and aukward." Let us carefully attend
to the idi6mi of our language, as well as to the
harmony of its confirmation.
It is observable that multitudes of our verbs,
perhaps one half of them that may be properly
called English, are mere nouns, used in the form
ot verbs. This is the cafe with love, fear, hope,
Jorm, fafbion, pen, interefl, provnf-, &c. which by
the prefix Jo, or the affixing the terminations of
verbs, become real verbs ; as to love, he /oveth,Hic.
It is evident to any person who looks into old
English authors, or examines the true ftrmture
of our language, that this was the original me
thod of forming our verbs ; it may therefore be
considered as the genius of onr language. When
ever therefore modern nouns or new words be
gin to be used as verbs, we have only to coufider
whether by afTuming a new form, or taking the
personal terminations of verbs, they do not be
come harsh, unharmonious, or of difficult accent
in pronunciation. If they donot, 1 feenoration
al objection to their use as verbs. The words
notice and advocate are not liable to this objection.
They are, in mofl vaiiations, of easy pronuncia
tion ; and as they abridge the number of words
necellary to convey certain ideas, I fiiould, with
deference to abler judges, suppose the use of them
as verbs, proper and admillible. The lame can
not be said of progress ; for to make it a verb it
would be neceflary to change the accent to the
lalt syllable, and even then it would be a harrti
and aukward word. The fame objection lies a
gainst the use of dijfculted, a word that cannot be
pronounced, without â¢violence to the organs.
The Doctor's remark on the use of opposed is
very just. For a man to fay "he is opposed to a
mcafure" is neither English nor sense. He may
oppose a measure and he opposed by another man ;
but not opposed to a meaOire ; tor this last pnffive
sense, fuppofesan agent which oppofei him to the
measure ; whereas the ast of oppolition, is limited
to the person, which neitter sense lhould not be
exprefied in the palfive form.
I am not a little surprised at the revival of the
word flricken, after being disused for centuries.
It may be fairly said that the word does not be
long to modern English, The participle offtrike
is jiruck ; the word flricken being used in one
phrase only in the vulgar translation ofthebible,
" flricken in years," and this phrase, as well as
the word, flricken, is wholly obsolete. 1 should as
soon have expected to fee the words wit and
trowed' revived in our national legiflavure, as flrick
en. For the honor of American Belles Lettres,
I hope the word may be permitted to reft in obli
vion. If Lowth's authority ihould be produced
against me, I would just observe, that he gives
Jlricken as an old participle of Jlriie, and Co he
does Jlrucken ; but where are the words used !â
Words are like leaves octrees, alwayscbanrhi*,
as Horace remarks ; but -when a word has
bs ufid by a nation, it no longer belongs to the but*
guage of that nation ; and thccompiler qf
mar has no right to fay it does. This is bdt of>4
of a j*reat number of egregious efrors* which we
find in Lowth's Introduiftion, a work which tea
done some good and some hurt. Evendn EwHW
authority we may as well use ftrucken aÂ» firfekfr,
but neither of them belongs to the present SajWk
language. , N. W. â¢"

REMARKS OM THE ENGLISH WRITERS.
MR: FINS'O t
I WAS much pleased with the " remarks o*
the Englilh Language," and hope they will
be duly attended to ; 1 am determined to puofic
by them, being conscious of their being applica
ble to myfelf. The New-England people arc
not the only persons who might be defervedl*
laughed at tor such blundersâfor their foutliern
brethren are not wholly free front them. That
attachment to ancient customs Ihould takeftrong
hold of the illiterate, and thereby prevent the
adoption of improvements in literature, or ufe
ful arts, tho it must pain every benevolent mind,
yet it is not surprising. But when we behold
those on whom the rays of jfcience have fallen,
whose understandings are expanded by cultiva
tion, and who consequently ought to be guided
by views of public utilityâl fay, when we be
hold such persons acting a similar part,it not only
gives pain, bat must chagrin every philanthro
pist. 1 hefe refletflions have repeatedly occured
to me, when I beheld Englifli writers larding
their labors with fcrapsfrom other languages,by
way of embeHifhmentâl think this practice, (so
justly branded with the epithet ofpedantry) ca" s
equally loud for ledrefs, with the blunders com
fliijed by common people in fpeaking âand is
/ xfar from being proper as " n'er a one by
which (tho I mean not to juftify it) the main pur
pose of language is anGiveredâbut the faults of
â which the learned are guilty, marks not, and
therefore cannot convey ideas to the majority of
readers. Sometimes a few Latin or French
"words are inserted in a sentence, and the connec
tion isfuch that the generality of readers would
be equally edified, if the space was filled with
Egypt' 3" hieroglyphics. lam convinced there
are many beautiful sentiments, and ufeful pre
cepts in the ancient writers, and among 110-
derns, not of our own language, that would be
difficult to tranllate in futh manner as to equal
the original in simplicity and precifiori ; I wo'uld
however suggest the propriety of inserting the
meaning in the body of the difcourfeâtho I
Ihould have no objection to have the original
given by way of notes, for the exquilite enter
tainment of linguists. ARISTIDES.
PARIS, June 10.
THE King will visit Paris only on Sunday's
the reft of the week he will sojourn at St.
Cloud or hunt at Rambouillet.
Our graver citizens do not approve of these
movements. To reside ac St. Cloud was a step
too far, in their opinions, but to haunt at Rain
bouillet is terrifying.
But do you not oÃferve, the more temperate
Patriots ask them, do you not obserVe with what
warmth and zeal bis Majetty elpoufes the new
conftitntion ?
Yes, they reply ; and we also recoiled! the fa
vourite maxim of Lewis XI Vth. he who knows
not how to dilfemble is not fit to reign.
A deputation of twenty four members waited
on the King to thank him for his late proclama
tion, and to " express" their " unutterable" joy,
transports.and affetftion at his Majelty's goodness
" in thus inviting" the French to liberty and
happiness."
LONDON, July i.
Ext rati of a letter from Philadelphia, April 20,
" Dr. Franklin lived and died an ornament to
the Philosophic and literary world; the press
has already produced l'ome anecdotes (hitherto
unpublished) of this veteran and reverend sage ;
it is said his ftoie of MS papers, memorandums,
and correfpondatory letters will afford a valt
scope for literary publication upon Philosophy,
Mathematics, legiflativeand circuitous Politicks,
prior to, and during the late war. His cprref
jpoadence seems to have been with men of the
firft rate abilities and genius, and not confined to
any part of the globe. He found means to get
communications ni the firit authority even fiibm
Asia as well as Africa, and the principal places
in Spaniih and Portuguese America. It is said
his valuable collection is not a little added to by
a series of letters written to hiin when at Paris,
between the years 1775 and 1753, in a flrile fimi-
Jar to that of the Jewilh Spy, by a Mr. D s,
(who was employed in England during that time
as agent for America, and is Ancegone to India)
and are fraught with much political as well as
commercial knowledge,defcribing in a particular
manner the manufa&ures, and giving characters
and anecdotes of the leading men of Grcat-Eri
tain, &c."
On .Saturday arrived here Mr. Hallett and Mr.
Hayward, two of the officers of the Bounty arm
ed (hip, under the command of Lieut. Bligh,
who were put on board an open boat in th_* inidft
of the Pacific ocean by a mutinous crew, and left
"to the mercy of the seas. 7 hey relate that molt
of the hands in the boat that survived to reach
Batavia, were so exhausted that it was feared na
ture would never be recruitedin them. Four of
the unfortunate fufferers are dead, and all the
relt left in a very languishing state, and unable to
take their paflage to Europe, except two feainen
who returned with the above gentlemen from
Batavia, in a Dutch ship. Tliefe survivors men
tion with astonishment their preservation after
the ship quitted them ; left alone in themidft of
a raging ocean, in a small open boat that was eve
ry moment liable to be filled with water and go
down under the.m. Their only chance (being
then in a ftreng eÂ«ftern trade wind) was to fleer
W. N. W. directly before the sea and wind, as
they would inltantly have foundered had they
attempted any other course. Having consider
ably upwards of 4000 miles before them till they
could expetft to fall in with any known land in
the Kaft Indies, despair (they fay) would have
taken full pofleffion of their minds had it not
been for the hope of falling in with some of the
unknown islands of the Western ocean. They
were not disappointed in this expectation, hav
ing at different times discovered several small
islands in that immeiife expanse of water, but all
of them inaccessible, owing to the natural rocki
riefs of the shores, and the prodigious furf that
broke upon them in every direction ; so that this
prospect only added to their misery, in present
ing them with the fight of herbage and cocoa nnt
trees in abundance, the fruit of which they could
yiiot enjoy ; at a time too when they were almost
penfhii>g for want of the least drop of inoilture,
excepting tliat which the ocean, thetr own urine,
or a transient lhower fapplied to thetn. Upon
one ofthefe islands they discovered savages, who
came down upon the rocks and seemed to coin
miferate their condition as they pafled by ; but
from the appearance of the- illand, which was
very finail and rugged, and,'Â£s Far as they could
fee, fuiVounded with broken reefs, these Indians
had 110 kind of embarkation, and probably till
that day had no idea that there were any hiAnan
beings in the universe except themselves.

I eace alone can secure and maintain to the
trench nation that freedom of constitution they
have so long and ardently fough't after ; war
would divert the attention of the people, give a
large system of patronage in the hands of the
Kinrand his minifteis, and perhaps finally over
turn that beautiful edifice of liberty which the
Ailembly has alinolt completed. Hostilities would
also bring about the evil which has been so long
apprehended, nor could the entire pofleilion of
the Church property prevent the much dreaded
calamities.
PORTSMOUTH 'England) July ir
The exertions in the i<ock-yard are beyond all

is a happy circumstance for this country, that
our naval arsenals contain at this moment stores
of every description in fufticient quantity tor se

of a single rope yarn. Yeiterday no less than
fifty fine feainen came in a body from London,
at their own expence, to enter on board the (hips
of war. The poor devils begin to think it as well
to enter voluntarily aj not, it being next to im
poflible for them to pursue their profeffion in

DISCOURSES ON DAVILA,
No. XX.â CONCLUDED.
Faible enfant, qui de Guise aJorait les capriccs
Et dont on ignorait les vertus ct les vices.
LA SAGUE took the road to Beam, charged
with letters and commissions for the King of
Navarre, from the Constable, the Admiral and
their adherents. At Etampes, he was arretted
and all his papers seized, and brought to court,
by order of the Qneen and the Guises. La Sague,
interrogated 011 the rack, confefled, that the
design of the Prince of Conde, to which the King
of Navarre was privy and consenting, was to
march from Bearn, uuder pretext of repairing to
court, and to make liimfelf niafter in his course,
of the principal cities of the kingdom, to take
polielfion of Paris by means of the Conftable,and
Marshall Montmorencie his foil, who had the go
vernnient of it ; to cause, in the next place to
revolt, Picardyj by the intrigues of Senarpont
and Bouchavannes ; Brittany, by tliofe of the
duke D'EftampeS, who, as governor had a pow
erful party there, He declared that the Prince
w9s in course to come to court, at the head of
all the forces of the Hugonots ; oblige the States
General to dismiss from the Ministry, the Queen
mother and the Guises, to declare that the King
cannot be of age, till twenty-two years old, and
finally to give him for tutors and regents of the
kingdom, the Constable, the Prince de Condeand
rlie King of Navarre. La Sague added, that by
moifteniiifr with water,the covering of the letters
of the Vidapie de Chartres, they would fee, in
writing, all that he h:;d revealed. The Plan of
the enemies of the Princes of Lorrain, was in
deed found upon tryal, written, upon the cover
of the letters of the Vidime de Chartres, in the
proper hand of Flemin D'Ardoy, secretary of the
Constable. This revelation of the fecrct by La
Sague, put the cifurc upon a tlioufand manoeuvres,
to ltrengthen their party in the Provinces, but
still they continued to diflemble their designs of
vengeance : The Protestants somewhat encourag
ed 011 one hand by hopes, and still tormented
wiih persecutions on the other, broke out in
arms in several places : But the Prince de Conde,
whofc anxiety must have been very great for his
present fafety, if his ambitition was not asinfati
able, and his natural inquietude as tronblefome
as is represented, made an attempt to seize upon
Lyonsas a strong hold, and an afyluin for hinifelf
and a place of arms for his party ; but he mis
carried, and many of his partisans, the poor Hu
gonots, were executed.
As soon as the King was informed of this enter
prize, he rcfolved not to give the discontented
leisure to form new ones. He left Fontainbleau
accompanied with a thousand lances, and two
regiments of old infantry, lately returned from
Piedmont and Scotland. He took the road to
Orleans, pressing the deputies of the Provinces
to repair to that city
The French nation is divided into three or
ders, or states, the Clergy, the Nobility, and the
People. These three orders are diftribnted into
thirty diftric r ts or jurifditf ions, called Bailliaces
or Senechalfies. When an aflembly of the Stares
General is ro be held, they resort to the capital
of their refped:ive Provinces, where they elect
each one separately a deputy, who afiiits, in the
name of his order, at the general adembly, and
who enters into all the deliberations relative to
the particular interests of each one of the three
orders, and to tlie general good of the state.
Each Bailliage furnilhes three deputies, the firft
for the Clergy, the second for the Nobility, and
the third for the People, under the name, which
in France was then considered as more lionoura
ble, of the third eitare. All these deputies af
femWed in presence of the King, of the Princes
of the blood, and of the officers of the crown
form the Body of the States General, and ad in
the name of the nation, whose power and autho
rity they represent.
