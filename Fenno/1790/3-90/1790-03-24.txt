" Great events give scope for great virtues ; but
the main tenor of human life is composed of small 0c-
citrrences
THE greater part of mankind can be conver
sant only in small occupations and incidents.
There are few eminent stations to be filled, and
few remarkable events to be noticed by men.
We should therefore conclude, that the materi
als of our happiness, and the objects of our duty,
principally consist in the due regulation ot the
common transactions of In whatever sphere
a man may move, his virtue is frequently put to a
trial, respecting matters which appeared too trivi
al to have exerciled his thoughts. He departs
from the line of his duty, and mars his felicity
in many instances, merely because he does not
view the occasion important enough, to make it
material in what manner he conducts. 1 here is
no remedy against the evils which result from
errors in thefmall concerns oflife, but to acquire
such virtuous dispositions and habits as lead us
to prefer right to wrong, in the most immateri
al circumstance that may occur.
In distinguished situations, a man may be
prompted to great exertions, and feftrained fiom
vicious aitions, from a regard to his character.
But in the humble walks of his life he m3y sup
pose his character out of the reach of notice, and
will not be on his guard againil those little (lips
and inadvertencies, which are more prejudicial
to his happiness, and indicate a want of virtuous
habits, in a greater degree than errors or oniil
lions of duty, in more confpicuos situations. Ihe
reason is obvious We are (eldom called to the
performance ofillnftrious actions; but everyday
and every hour oflife introduces us to common
occurrences. An habit of doing wrong in these
will occur so frequently that the aggregate of in
convenience will exceed what would result from
a wrong procedure, in the few instances of emi
nent conduct, with which we may beconverfant.
The danger likewise of error on great occasions
is diminilhed by the energy of motive that im
pels us to act with propriety.
Habits of virtue form the only security against;
the numerous temptations by which we arc con
stantly surrounded. " Theymnft be formed and
fupported,potby unfrequent a<ts,but by daily and
frequent exertion, in order to their becoming vi
gorous andufeful. Great events give lcope for great
virtues ; but the tenor of human life is composed
of ftnall occurrences. Within the round of these
lie the materials of happin.efs of most men ; the
subjects of their duty, and the trials of their vir
tue. Whatever is to be our profeflion, no edu
cation is more necefl'ary to success, than the ac
quirement of virtuous dispositions and habits.
Whether science, or business, or public life be our
aim, virtue still enters for a principal share into
all those great departments of society. By what
ver arts we may at firft attract the attention, we
can hold the esteem and secure the hearts of o
thers, only by amiable dispositions, discreet ha
bits and virtuous actions."

Patriots.
" Sincc my report of the aotli instant, made
to your Majesty, the placart of the fame date,
publiflied the day after, proves that my ideas
werejuft, upon the intentions of Government;
the insolence of the people, notwithstanding does
not .contradicft it. Not only the four companies of
the regimentof Clairfayt, and two of Vierfit, are
detained prisoners at Ghent, and that of Captain
Bropore at Bruges, but bands of Patriots are
again upon our frontiers. The day after (the
21ft) the insurgents, tb theamount ofinany thou
sands, thre\v themselves into Turnhout and Hoog
ftraeten, which they still occupy. The rebels of
Flanders are entrenched at Ghent, and many of
them joined those in the town of Dieft after an
a<ftion in which they loft two or three hundred
men, but obliged' Major Broeda, with a division
of the regiment of Bender, which he commanded,
to retire to Arfchot, with the loss of nineteen men
and a piece of cannon.
" The misfortune at Dieft was moil unex
pected by me, and owing to General Count
Baillet, who commanded at Louvain, deferring
for twenty-four hours the dispositions I ordered to
make.
" To parry th" danger of the attack upon
Louvain, I instantly placed a battalion on the bor
ders of the sorest of Meldert, to intercept all
those inclining that way. ,
" General Hopencourt having evacuated Mons
without my orders, on the simple requisition of
Colonel Blekem, who found himfelf threatened at
Namur, I sent him, with his battalion and fqua
di 011 to the right of Neville, where he now is,
and from whence 1 may order him either to Lou
vain or to BrufTels, as occasion may require.
" The account of the taking of Dieft, deter
mined me to aflemble a force at Louvain, to drive
off the insurgents ; and I ordered a battalion of
the regiment of Ligne to march to that garrison,
and intended myfelf to take the executive com
mand of four battalions, and three hundred and
fifty horse, to force that troop of banditti; but
the edidt of the 21ft inft. required infinite circum
fpetftion on my part, and not to cross the negocia
tions of the Minister, recommended by his letter
to the people, of the 25th inflant. I enclosed hiin
a copy of the opinions of the general officers, and
Colonel de Brofe, assembled in council, at my '
house; but having received an equivocal and
verbal answer, I addressed to him a note, a copy
of which I enclose for your Majefly, and meeting
with a similar answer, I repeated my reprefenta
tioti; and the Minister coming tome in company
with the Vice Chancellor, M. Crumpipen every
reason urged could not make him alter his con
duct, notwithftandingthe importance of the ob
ject, under the pretext, that he should wait the
effect of his letter, written the 2jth, and the
Edicft of the 26th ; however, I engaged him to
make no further concession, which he promiled
me ; I then determined to defer my expedition
until the insurgents were informed of the favor
able disposition of Government, although I had
taken the preparatory and certain measures to re
duce tliem, &c. &c.
" But what was my aftoniftiment to find that the
Edicft of that day had been printed, and distributed
to the public two hours before the Miniftei* de

CONGRESS.
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
MONDAY, MARCH t, 1790.
IN committee of the whole HoufeÂ»âThe proposition for altum
ing the State debts, and the amendments proposed thereto, be
ing under consideration.
MR. JACKSON observed, that he had from the intro
duction of the resolutions before the committee,particularly agai\il
the one now in contemplation : That he was opposed to it, not
only in its original form, but ia every poflible modification it
might aflume. That his ind'ifpofition had prevented his rising be
fore : That altho many arguments must have been used, which it
was importable for him to know : His duty compelled him to
come forward ; not with an expeÂ£tation that his small abilities
could change the sentiments of a fjrjgle member, or that he should
gain a single proselyte ; but to (hew t*he reaions for which he op
posed the meafurc, and to produce some fa&s arising in the State
he represented. He confeffed, that if he was in favor of any mo
dification, it was the one which an honorable gentleman from
Virginia (Mr. White) had brought forward a few days finct: As
he had not been present at the former part of the debatt. he hoped
the house would indulge him in entering on the original ground,
and pointing out the light in which the buiinefs appeared to him.
The question might be viewed on three grounds : lft. the ex
pediency; 2d, the policy ; and 3d!)*, the justice of the refoiution.
It might be expedient, either from the prefling call of the States
who might complain of the grievance of their debts ; or, it might
be expedient from the clamors of the citizens of the refpeÂ£H\Â»e
States, complaining of the State taxation. On the firft point, he
believed the States had made no fbch requeil, and that therefore
the expediency on that head was obviated. That he had hearjd
indeea, that South-Carolina had made some kind of application,
but that one or two States could not declarethe fenfeof the Union;
it could be known only by a majority, which did not appear t-o
demand this aflumption. That on the contrary he believed a ma
jority of the States were against the proposition, and that North-
Carolina had made it an article of amendment, u that Congress
should not interfere with the state debts," and that the voice of
North-Carolina, as well as South-Carolina, should be attended to.
With rcfpeft to individual citizens, no complaints had been
made to the house ; no petitions or Lnftru&ions had been forwar
ded to their representatives. Here he would remark, that it was
on this latter principle he wiflied, at a former day* the postpone
ment of the question, that the sense of his constituents might be
known. The wifli of individuals was therefore not ascertain
ed by cither method, and he believed that a great majority were
for the State debts remaining as they were; That they were fatis
fied with the State taxation by known and accuftomcd methods,
handed down to them by their ancestors. Many of the States had
imposed taxes in those certificates, and had cxtinguifhed a great
part of the State debts ; which taxes the citizens had cheaiiully
Submitted to : This had been done in the State he represented.
To those, he observed, he might add a third reason, why it was
not expedient, the creditors themfelve* had not requested it; there
was no petition, no evidence to warrant a conftru&ion that they
wished it.
He would now consider its policy : Here the field expanded.
He had as high an opinion of the Secretary's abilities as any man :
They were conspicuous : The force of his genius was flriking, and
his talents in the report were admired ; but he was one of thole who
did not think the Secretary infallible; aslongas he poflefied human
nature, so long would he possess the imperfe&ions and failings of
human nature. Ambition, laudable perhaps, to do theutmoft for
thfc Union, might lead him too far, and the plan, evidently to him,
in its policy, had reference to one of two points : firft, that it
is extended as an additional ligature to the continent, by detaching
the creditors from their dependance on the state governments, and
transferring that dependance to the nation, and thereby making it
the intereftof the remote parts of the Union,to support its mea
furcs ; or, secondly, by this specious method of relieving the States,
to remove every pretext for taxation from them, and thereby throw
that power entirely into the hands of Congress.
If we examine however the firftof those pofitioris, we shall find
it will not hold its ground ; for, the securities of the refpe&ive
States, likethofe of the continent, will change their holders ; nay,
they are already to the fouthwardgone from the original creditors
and are in the hands of speculators : they will like the continental
fecuritie6, be drawn to a point in a few commercial cities, or travel
into the hands of foreigners. The ligature, if this position is true*
will therefore not hold ; the tie will soon be broken.
The second will better stand its ground ; Snd I grant that the
whole powers of taxation may be absorbed by the Union. But
Sir, is it policy to take all the powers of taxation from the indi
vidual States and leave them' with the (hadow of a governmenr.
Is it policy to reduce their power to the infignificance of a. small
city corporation, or will the citizens be pleased with it ? A ma
jority, I believe, will be found attached to the modes and the lawg
of the State governments. Some of the most zealous partizans of
the present government, in the State conventions, in order to point
out its excellencies, compared it to a pyramid ; the foundationo(
which was the broad bans of the people, the middle or second
story the State governments, and the top or head the government
of the Union. Sir, let us beware, left in weakening this centrc
work, the head itfelf is riot in danger. The system before the
committee would require a multitude of tax gatherers, who would
be oppreflive to the people ; and at the best view what would the
people gain, but a change of masters and customs which they had
been used to, for masters and customs they had been unacquainted
with.
The Union, he observed, had been frequently compared to a
rope of sand ; it was well to beware, left the argument be carried
too far the other way ; left this ligatureâthis cord, by its too great
D'ALTON."tXtenfioo, might snap, and be rendered more difficult to biinÂ£
together than the rope of faud divided in a dozen places.
Let us look to the policy of the former Congress. Did they
ever entertain an idea of taking on themselves the State debts ?
Did they ever pledge the faith of the continent to aflame them ?
NayâDid they, when they applied to the reipeÂ£live States for
the power of preserving the Union, I mean the five per cent, ever
dream of dilcharging those debts, or did any of thÂ£ States require
it ? The constitution did not contemplate it ; for that provides
for the debts of the Union only, and many of the State debts are
not of a continental nature, and ought not to be a continental
-charge ; of this kind, I hold the Penobfcot expedition trom Mas
sachusetts, and the fitting out the (hip South-Carolina by that State.
If States choole to run into those balloon exploits on their own ac
count, their neignbors ought not to pay tor it. The intention of
the present fyilero I imagine is to introduce all those charges.
Policy, he said, was against the atrumption. Many ot the
States have material objections, and will view the interterence
with a jaundiced eye ; and uotwithftauding what gentlemen so fre
quently ridicule ot monsters and hydras, jealoufits will arise, and
peihaps from the nature of republican governments it is necessary
they (hould. I think, at least, that there will be a just founda
tion for fhem in the present inftance âfor, will the citizen who
has alread) paid his proportion of the debt to his State, content
edly fee a new burthen imposed on himfelf and his poftentyâa
burthen we know not when we shall be rid ofâa burthen we
know not the weight or amount of.
Again Â§ir, is it policy on the fubjefl of public credit ; paper '
of whatever denomination, whether flock or not, will be atfeÂ£led
by the quantity in circulation, and will be depreciated accord
ingly. Policy on every principle forbids itâpolicy forbids us, in
the vigor of youth, to cloath ourfelvcs with all the impotence, im
becility and infirmity of extreme old political age. Britain wai
seventeen hundred years politically ola, dating trom Julius Caesar's
invasion, before Ihe had a funded debt. The United States have
scarcely attained their fourteenth political year, when they are a
bout to mortgage themselves and posterity lor a funded debt ; the
â¢one third, or perhaps the one hall ot the amount of Britain's enor
mous debts at this day.
Mr. Jackson observed, that the justice of the measure had as
many oojetfions.
The greatest plea of justice was, that the debt was of the fame
nature, and contra&ed for the fame reasons and in the fainecaufe.
His arguments before, he said, had proved this not to be altoge
ther the cafe : butfuppofmg it was, he asked whether it was jus
tice to compel the citizen who had already contributed, to pay a
i'econd proportion. Gentlemen had talked much of the exertions
of their Statesâthe hardlhips they had enduredâand the ravages
they had sustained. He could advance, with equal confidence,
that he came from the State which had fuffered the mod of any
in the Union ; where there was noplace, no corner but where
the British arms had been carried ; where the families had been
totally driven off, and their properties had been totally destroyed ;
where the inhabitants had scorned the Britifti proteÂ£hon, and left
their properties behind them ; where what the Britilh had left,
the American army had taken to subsist on, and not a certificate
had been given in numerous instances. Yet those citizens whose
property had been thus destroyed, had cheerfully submitted to
the payment of the State debt. But would it be justice, after all
those lodes, and after this already voluntary contribution, to put
our hands again in their pockets, and fay, you must pay the
debts of MalTachufetts and South-Carolina. If those States have
not done as they oughtâif they have not extinguifhcd their debts,
they have themselves to blame for it.
Sir, in Georgia the audited debt has drawn no interestâinter
est has been allowed only on a small proportion of funded debt ;
for we also Mr. Chairman, must have our project of funding, un
til we were convinced by experience it would not answer, and
that we could not pay a regular specie interest. By this plan, fir,
all those audited certificates will draw interest from the time of
liquidation, which will greatly increase the debt of Georgia, and
not benefit her citizens : for the late speculations, no doubt have
changed the holders, and the very man who did the service or fur
niftied thefupply, contented with the principal sum, will now
have to contribute his pioportion towards payment of the interest
of his own certificate and which he himfelf was not entitled to.
By the system before us tht settlement with the States is post
poned to a distant dayâa day which never may arrive, and not
withstanding the balance may be in favor of the State I repre.fent,
the citizen may be forever bound for the intercft of this enormous
debtâthe debt of other States.
There is another part of the Secretary's report which will ma
terially injure Georgia. The proviso, that where a Hate shall have
rxchangcd the securities of the continent for those of her own, no
settlement shall be made until those exchanged certificates (hall be
brought in and surrendered. The State of Georgia little thinking
of such a day as this, altho very materially concerned, has, as it
-was usual with her, burnt her exchanged certificates as they have
returned to her trcafury. Is she, because those certificates have
been funk and fentto oblivion, and which I wish our whole debt
was, to fuffer for her honcfty, and that of her citizcns ?
Sir, I will not tax the Secretary ith thedefign ; 1 will not im
pute the intention to him ; but I trust that we (hall not run our
lcives enormously in debt and mortgage ourfelvesand our children,
to give ftope to the abilities of any minister on earth to give an
opening to (hew the talents he possesses of managing taxes and the
resources of the burthen he unpofes.
Mr. Jackson concluded, by faying, that tohis mind and agreeably
to the reasons he had given, he was convinced the aflumptionof
the State debts was inexpedient, impolitic, and unjust ; and he
trusted that it would not be adopted.
Mr. Smith (S. C.) replied to Mr. Jackson, that he rtiould be as
un billing as that gentleman to assume debts of any State incurred
for balloon schemes (as they had been termed) but he did not think
the Penobfcot expedition or the South-Carolina irigate came
within that defenption ; the members from MafTachuflfetts could
answer for the former, and a? to the latter, he could fafely fay that
the State of South-Carolina fuffcred such injury to her commerce
during the war, that a naval prote&ion was indifpenfibly neccffary
âthat other States were prote&cd by vetfels of war on continen
tal establishments, while the State alluded to was unprote&ed, and
her trade crippled by the enemyâthat the equipment ot that vef
iel had cost a much less sum than was generally believed, as but a
small part of the sum demanded had been allowed by the State.
He obierved, that as the union were under obligations to protefl
every part, so were they also bound to contribute their propor
tion of expence, incurred by any particular part tor its own de
fenceâthar this was language which had been much repeated dur
ing the I ast, feflion, when the houfehad been called 011 to vote a
large sum of money for the protection oi Georgia from the Creeks,
and which under the influence of that principle, the house had
a&ually done. That State could have justly complained had she
been left to protest herfelf, and to incur io heavy a burden.âMr.
Smith said the opposition of gentlemen to the measure seemed to
originate in an idea thatthefe weiethe private debts of the several
States incurred for their own particular purposes ; the fact was
just the reverseâthey were as much the debts of the continent, as
those which were called the continental debtsâthey were as much
the price of independenceâinstead of their being State debts as
sumed by the continent, they were in truth continental debts
which the States had assumed when Congress were unable to pay
them ; but now Congress had in its exclusive poffeflion the bell
resources of the nation, and (hould all those resources be applied
so the payment of a few continental creditors (and they had been
frequently told that all the continental securities were in the hands
of a few speculators) to the total ruin of all the State creditors, it
was eafv to anticipate dangerous consequences ; indeed such would
be the diflatisfadion on the part of the State creditors, that it would
couiidei ably obftiuft the colli & ion oi" the national revenue. There
had been no reason afligned, and he believed it was impoflible to
aflign any, which could eftablffh a diflinÂ£lion between the one
and the other class ot these creditorsâtheir claims were precifcly
similar, and they ought to be provided tor on similar terms.
Gentlemen were miilaken, if they thought South-Carolina had
made no exertions to discharge her debt since the peaceâthat State
had levied on her citizens every year a tax, which cjnlidermg hei
losses by the war, and the devafUtions committed by the enemy,
was a very considerable one, amounting to upwards ot 300,000
dollars annually for the interefl, besides a million and an half oi
dollars principal paid off, making upwards of three millions ol
dollars.
It had been said that Great Britain was 1700 years old before
(he began a funding fyflem, while the United Mates were about to
adopt it at the age ot 14 ; to that he observed, that America was.
nearly, if not quite, as lar advanced in political sagacity in ftci
early youth as Great-Britain in her extreme old age, having the
experience of Great-Britain, and of other nations during a long
course of years as her guide ; and that he always thought the vigoi
of youth was more equal to the support of heavy burden? than in
firmity of age. He agraed with the geutleman that if the measure
was a wrong one, the sentiments of one or two States should not
influence their determination, but he was persuaded that on a diU
cuflion of its own merits, it would be found necessary tor the u
nion and tranquility of all the States.
To Mr. Smith's answer, that the State debts were all on a foot
ing with the debts of the Union, and that on this principle, Geor
gia had received protection laftyear, and might receive more this,
Mr. Jackson replied, that if Georgia had received pru:eÂ£tion, it
had not been with the vote of some members from thatStace (S. C v
who supposing, as he would charitably allow, that ihe Georgians,
and not M'Gillivray, were in the wrong, had withheld then
voice ; that however in his opinion, the cases were not the fame :
but he denied that Georgia hitherto had received the least shadow
of protettion from the union, although the moll favorable report
was exifling of their condutt on the table.
That the cases were not similar, because in the cases of Georgia
there was an invasion of the union*: whilst in the cafe of the fhi
the South-Carolina which he had mentioned, thai State had don
what they were not warranted in by the laws of Congress or con
federation. The fitting out Ihips of warâthat that State was no
contented to be 011 an equality with her fillers, but aimed at a
high founding fame, of poffefling vessels of wai in her own em
ploy. That her# he w->uld remark, that as well in this cafe as in
that of the State vessel of Massachusetts, it could not be expected
that the Union should defray their expence. He would aikif any
of the prize monies of those vessels had been lodged in the trea
sury of the continent. He believed it h d not been the cafe, and
if it had not, the States which had reaped the benefits ought to
pay the charges.
The gentleman had insinuated, that as Georgia had allowed no
interefl or could not pay the interefl of her fundi d debt, ihe cer
tainly could not have discharged much of her debt. He would
put that gentleman right on this head, by assuring him, thai altho*
Georgia had not specie fufficient to 6lfcharge the inteieft of her
funded debt regularly, yet fhc had funk some hundred thousand
dollars of her principal debt.
Mr. Sedgwick said that he had not the vanity to suppose an.
thing new which hecould fay would authorise him to expett the alrea
dy txhaufted patience of the committee, in an exteniivt disc uHion
of the vast fubjeft before them. He would however, call on the
candor of the gentlemen who so strenuously opposed the propofiti
ou under confederation, for, an attempt to answer some of the ar
guments which had been repeatedly advanced by himfelt and the
gentlemen with whom he had the honor to aÂ£t and think on this
occasion.
He observed that the revolution was a common, a national cauf.,
lhat therefore the expeufe should be equally apportionedâthai
whatever had been advanced towards the attainment of the objetfc
should be fatisfied, if within the ability of the government. That
if the whole could not be paid the iofs mould be fuitained in equal
and just proportion : That these were the di&ates of common
justice and common honesty. and universally considered as con
clusively binding in the usual intercourse of men in civil society :
That thus confidcring the fubjeft, he thought the States now stag
gering under an unequal weight of burden, had a right to demand
of this government the adoption of the proposed measure. He fur
ther observed that this demand for justice would appear the more
reasonable, when it was considered that the government wduld not,
should the resolution be adopted, sustain any loss. For that it was
infaft true, as had been repeatedly stated, that lhould the debts
be aflumed, there wouid still remain, a baliance due, to every
State. Bccaufe there was no State, which since the commence
ment of the war had not done more than to support the expences
of its own government, and all its other incidental charges. That
this would be tvident, when it was remembered, that the whole
with which a State, in the event could be charged, would be, the
debt to be assumed, together with what had been heretofore ad
vanced to it ; and on the other hand it would be entitled to a cre
dit for all its advances and services in the war. In th s view of
the fubjeft, which was the just one, he wished gentlemen would
explain why the government should delay to put the citizens on a
footing of equality ?
He observed that the accounts of individual States with the Uni
ted States would ultimately be fettled, or they would not : If the
former, then justice would be done to all ; it the latter, the only
charitable and liberal supposition would be, that the States had
equally exerted themselves in their glorious struggle for freedom.
He further wished gentlemen would explain to the committee

cred itors, who it had been proved were equally entitled with others
to justice. He affirmed that as it refpetted some of the States, no
efficient mealures, of national finance, could be carried into execu

engagements âengagements entered into at a time when they were
in poUeflion of funds which were fully adequate to the purpose,
and which funds were now surrendered to this government.

FRIDAY, MARCH 19.
Sketch of the debate on Mr. Sherman's motion for appointing
a committee to enquire into the receipts and expenditures of pub
lic money during the administration of the Hon. Robert Morris
late fuperintendant of Financc.
Mr Gerry observed that feme how or other the House is con
tinually recurring to the modes of procedure adopted by the latc
Congress, who were both a legislative and executive body ; the
present government is organized on quite different principles
The President of the United States is the only competent author
ity to take cognizance of the conduct of officers in the executive
departmentâif we pursue the proposed plan of appointing com
mittees we destroy the refponfibily of executive officers and d iveft
the House of a great and cflenti.l privilege, that of impeaching
our executive officers for mal-adminiflration. He concluded by
faying he was in favor of the report of the Senate for the appoint
ing commissionersâas placing the business in a more parliament
ary and conllitutional direction.
Mr. Gerry was replied to by Mr. Hartley and Mr. Fitzfimons
who contended that the motion was ftrittly parliamentary as n
was certainlyjult that an investigation on the part of the House of
the conduit of public officers ought to precede all crimination of
their conduit; this enquiry Mr. Morris has applied for and on
every principle of equity, he ought to have a fair and full hearing,
that if his conduit has been such as to merit approbation, he may
no longer lay under any disadvantageous or injurious imputation.
Mr. Jackson called tor a reading ott'ne memorial; which being
readâ-He objected to the appointment of a committee, he thought
uunneccffary, it would cltablifh a precedent which would ?r,.
-394-
voJve a great variefy of difficulties ; he had no doubt of the honor
and rectitude of conduct 111 the memorialist, he was ready to ac
knowledge that he had rendered the country great and meruorious
servicesâand that this was the opinion of the people in general
through the United Statesâhe was for accepting the report of the
committee and thus finifh the business.
Mr. Vining was in favor of the motionâand observed that the
report (itappears) does not come up to the ideas of the memorialiifc
âhe wilhes to give particular fatisfdÂ£tion to the members of this
noufe ; he wishes the. fanÂ£l ion of this house to the merit of his ser
vices, should they on invefligation appear to deserve such a fanc
tion.julHce is all he asks for,and furtly gentlemen will not deny that.
Mr. Fitziimons followed Mr. Vining in a similar train of obfei
vations.
Mr. Bland was opposed to the motion : he thought the report
was a full juflification of the conduÂ£l of Mr. Morris ; he was op
posed to appointing commiilioners, as creating an unnecessary ex
pence.
Mr. Madison was in favor of the motion, he offered a variety of
observations on the fubjeft, and in support of the idea, that the
House should possess itfelt of the fullefl information in order 10
doing juflice to the country and to public officers.
Mr. Gerry defended his firft opinion, that the several branches
of government should be kept separateâhe was only solicitous he
said that the house should not eflabhfh a precedent which would
mix the several parts of the government. The memorialist re
qucfts the appointment of commiflionersâand what is the ob
j Â£tion : nothing more than the expence, which in a matter ofjul
ice, ought not to be considered.
Mr. Stone observed on the idea of expence, that if the business
is easy to be fettled, commiflioners will not be wanted for a long
lme ;if the business is intricate and difficult, a committee will be
very improperâhe was therefore in favor of commiflioners.
Mr. Sherman said that for himfelf he was perfcÂ£lly fatisfied ref
peding the accounts of Mr. Morris ; they are certified by as good
and honefl men as can poflibly be appointedâmen entirely un
iifluenced and uncontrouled by any perf on whatever ; but flill he
thought to give full fatisfa&ion to the memorialist and to wipe off
any aspersions which may have been cast on him, he was in favor
of a committee.
MONDAY, MARCH 22.
The amendments proposed by the senate to the bill foreftabiifh
inj an uniform rule of naturalization, and to the bill to provide
for the mitigation or remifTion of fines, forfeitures and penalties
in certain cases, were taken into consideration. To the firftbill
one amendment only was proposed, which was agreed to by the
house. The amendment to the other, it was said, involved anal

le&ions were made, and on motion it was voted that the amend
ment should lie on the table.
In committee of the whole; the report of the feleÂ£t committee

sixth article was further dikulTed.
Mr. Scott commenced the debate this day in advocating the
prayer of the memorialists, he was replied to by several ot the
Southern gentlemen. It was moved that the claufelhould be ftiuck
.out, this motion being put, it pafled in the negative.
The committee then agreed to the proportion.
The Seventh article was struck out of the report.
The committee then rose, and the report, as amended and agreed
to, was laid on the table.
A roeflage was received from the senate, with the bill making

versation, the amendment was concurred in with an amendment.
The committee to whom was referred the petition of Rich
ard Wells and John Hart, brought in the following report.
Resolved, That the poflTcffors of the continental bills of credit,
emitted by the authority of Congress, before the iÃtb day of March,
1780, on bringing the fame into the Treafuryof the United States,

on interest of fix per cent, per annumâfrom the time it was re
ceived into the Treasury of the refpeftive States; laid on the table.
It was then moved that the house {hould take up the report of
the committee of the whole on the memorials of the people called
Quakers. âThis motion was oppofedby Mr. Jackson, Mr. Smith,
Mr. Burke, and Mr. Blandâthey severally observed that the dif
:uffion of the fubjeft has already excited a spirit of diffention a
mong the members of the houseâand that every principle ot po
icy and concern for the dignity of the house, and the peace and
ranquility of the United States, concur to shew the propriety of
iropping the fubjeft, and letting it deep where it is.âOn the o
her hand Mr. Vining, Mr. Hartley, and Mr. Page observed, thai
here was the fame propriety in taking up the fubjett at the pre

The following address from the citizens of the county
of Albemarle, was presented to the Hon. Thomas
Jefferfon, Efq; at his feat, the 12th day oj Feb
ruary, 1 790.
PERMIT us to present to you our moil sincere
congratulations on your return to your native
county. We should do a violence to our feelings,
and illy reward your merit, if we did not upon
this occasion, give you this teftiinonial of our es
teem.
At an early period of your life, and a very criti
cal tcra of public affairs, weele<ftedyou our repre
sentative in the General Aflcmbly. The fubje<fts
which at that time engaged the deliberations of
that body, were kighlv iniereftingto our country.
The controversy into which we were from neceifi
ty about to embark, involved consequences of the
firft importance to society, and called for the exer
tions of those of her citizens who were mod dif
tinguilhed for their wifdoin, integrity and patrio
tism. Your conduit in the discharge of thattruft,
merited our warmest approbation, and in a review
of the signal services you have since rendered, we
have always considered it a lingular instance of
good fortune, that we conferred, and that you ac
cepted the appointment. In that station, your
talents and virtues became known to yoifr country,
by whom they were afterwards made more exten
sively beneficial to the community at large. By
their appointment, you have since held a leries of
high political employments, and we have reason
to believe that your conducft in every stage, has
been as fatisfa<flory'to those whom you served, as
it was in the commencement inoft acceptable to us.
We ihould wound your feelings if we entered
into a d etail of those adts of your public life which
we highly approve. We cannot, however, decline
alluring you, that we have been particularly hap
py to observe the ftrongattachment you have al
ways shewn to the rights of mankind and to those
inilitutions that were best calculated to prelerve
them. Conduct like this, founded on such noble
and illustrious principles, will always entitle you
to, and secure you the gratitude of your fellow
citizens.
If we cojifult the particular benefit of our coun
ty, in a variety of instances, we fliould feel anxi
ous, that you woujd for the future remain with
us.âBut America has still occasion foryour servi
ces, and we are too much attached to the com
mon interests of our country, and entertain
too high a refpetft for yourmerit, not. to unite
with the general voice that you continue in her
councils. In whatever line you may think pro
per to aÂ«ft, you will have our most earncft wi flies
for your welfare.
February 12, 1790.
To which he made the following reply.
Gentlemen,
T'HE testimony of esteem with which you are
to honor my return to my native county,
fills me with gratitude and pleasure. While it
that my absence has not loft me your friendly
recolle<flion, it holds out tlie comfortable hope
that when the hour of retirement shall come, 1
(hall again find myfelf amidlt those with whom I
have long lived, with whom I wi/li to live, and
whose aftetftion is the fonrce of my present hap
piness.--Their favour was the door through which
I was ufliered on the stage of public life ; and
while 1 have been led on through its varying
scenes, I could not be unmindful of those who as
signed me my firft part.
My feeble and obfeure exertions in their service,
and in the holycaufe of freedom, have had 110 o
tlier merit than that they weremybeft. We have
all the fame. We have been fellow labourers,
and felJow-fuffcrers ; and Heaven has rewarded
395
us with a happy ifluefrom our druggies. It rests
now with ourselves alone to enjoy in peace and
concord the bleflings of felf-govcrnment, so long
denied to mankind ; to fliew bv example the fuf
ficiency of human reason for the care of human
affairs; and that the will of the majoriry, the na
tural law of every fociery, is the only sure guar
dian of the rights of man. Perhaps even this
may sometimes err, but its errors are lioiielt, so
litary and short-lived. Let us then iny dear
friends, for ever bow down to the general reason
of the society. We are fafe with that, even in
its deviations, for it soon returns again to the
right way. These are leflbns we have learnt to
getherâwe have prospered in their practice ;
and the liberality with which you are pleafedto
approve iny attachment to the general rights of
mankind, allures me we are still together in these
its kindred sentiments.
Wherever 1 may be flationed by the will of my
country, it will be my delight to fee in the gene
ral tide of happiness, that your's too flows 011 in
just place and ineafure. That it may flow through
all time, gatheringftrength as it goes, andfpread
ing the happy influence of reason and liberty
over the face of the earth, is my fervent prayer
to Heaven.

The Abbe Raynal, that celebrated Philofoplier

from the laws of universal jultice. No principles
of policy can juftify the breach of her sacred laws.
In so enlightened an age, an age where so many
errors are boldly laid open, it would be fhameful
to conceal any truth that isinterefting to human
ity. We will firft prove that no reason of State
can authorize slavery. In doing this we lhall not
hesitate to arraign, before the tribunal of eter
nal light and jultice, all thofegovernments; who
tolerate the cruel pracftice, or are not afliamed to
make it the basis of their power. The great
Montesquieu could not prevail upon himfelf to
treat the question concerning slavery, in a se
rious light. In reality it is degrading to reason
to employ it, I will not fay in defending, but e

ever juftifiesfo odious a system deserves the ut

ADDRESS of the GENERAL ASSEMBLY of the
State of GEORGIA,
To THE PRESIDENT of the UNITED STATES
SIR,
THE federal Constitution being adopted, it be
came the wish of the people of this State
that you Ihould be elevated to the Presidency of
the Union ; and the two branches of tlieLegifla
ture take the firfl. occasion of offering to your ac
ceptance their congratulations on the unanimity
of your election.
In the great concerns of mankind success has
not always been attendant ontheperforman.ee of
duty ; and where it has, the famflion of public
approbation has frequently been withheld ; but
it was reserved for you in the midst of the molt
arduous difficulties, not only to be fuccefsful, but
to have been so with univei sal applause.
Raised by your virtues and services to the head
of !i government, pervading so many independent
States, the general confidence is in favor of your
justice, and, while the hiltory of nations informs
that the errors of rulers have often proceeded
from the want of information, we lhall not hesi
tate to Hy before you such fads and opinions ref
pe<sting this State, as may appear to us to be in
cumbent or neceflary. In doing this, it (hall be
our aim to unite plainnels with respect, and in
tegrity with truth.
Sir, in the course of the war which eftabliflied
our independence, our citizens made proportion
ate exertions withthofe of any part of the whole,
and, in point of property, they fuffered the molt :
the peace found the country a waste ; with many
natural advantages, we flattered ourselves with
a speedy recovery, when we were attacked by the
Indians.
On this fubjeft we wish to be delicateâmuch
has been already saidâwe have aflerted, and it
has been contradictedâremoved at a distance from
the centre, our actions have been liable to inifre
prefentation ; but we trust that by this time, they
are better explainedâin the mean while our po
pulation has been checked, and our agriculture
diminishedâthe blood of our citizens has been
spilled, our public refoufces greatly exhausted ;
and our frontiers still open to frefti ravages. The
failure of the late negociation for a peace with
the Creek Indians, and the circumstances which
attended the fame, are the best evidence of the
necessity of our nieafures and a proof of the late
hostile disposition of these people : but under
the influence of the government and power of
the Union, it is to be hoped and expected that a
different condu<fl will on their part prevail : on
our part, nothing /hall be wanting to promote so
desirable an ellablifhment.
Another circumstance of additional calamity
attendant on our being the south frontier of the
Union, is, the facility of our black-people cros
sing the Spanish line, from whence we have never
been able to reclaim them. This has already
been productive of much injury to private per
sons, and if not speedily retrained, may grow
into an evil of national magnitude.
We take this occasion of bringing this business
into view, with a perfed: reliance, that you will

By order of the House of Repre{e>tt<ntives,
SEABORN JONES, Speaker.
The President of the United States.
To the GENERAL ASSEMBLY of the STATE of
GEORGIA.
Gentlemen,
THE congratulations presented to nie by the
different branches of the legislature of the
state of Georgia, upon my having been ele(fted
with unanimity to the Presidency of the United
States, afFe<stmy niind with the moftpleafing sen
sations ; and demand my best acknowledgments.
From the observation, that, in the great con
cerns of mankind fucccfs has not always been
attendant on the performance of duty, and
that, where it has, the fancflion ot public appro
bation has frequently been withheld ; J am na
turally led to reflect on the unlimited gratitude
which we owe, as a nation, to the Supreme Ar
biter of human eventsfor his interposition in our
favor, as well as on the lingular obligations which
are due from me, as an individual, for the indul
gent sentiments which my fellow-citizens have
always had the goodness to entertain of my con
duct.
Raised, as I am, to the head of a government
pervading so vast a territoryâand poflelfing, as
1 flatter myfelf I do, the confidence of the people
in regard to my dispositionsâl afl'ure you, gen
tlenicn, that nothing could be more consonant to
my wishes than to be favored with such facSts and
opinions refpeifting the condition of the states as
may. appear proper and neceflary. Â¥orl am duly
ienfible that many errors which would result from
want of information, may be obviated by timely
and just representations.
I am not ignorant how much the local fitnation
of your Hate exposed its inhabitants to fuffer the
diftrefles of the late war in a severe manner ; nor
how manfully they exerted themselves indefence
of the common cause during the struggle which
established our independence.âWatted as your
country was at the return of peace, and exposed
as your frontiers have since been to the ravages
of the Indians, I cannot but flatter myfelf that
you will ere long realize the bleflings which were
to be expected from your natural resources, and
find a compensation for your fufFerings in the be
nefits of an efficient general government.
It will not be expedted, I presume, on this oc
casion, that I should enter into the merits of the
delicate fubjedt to which you allude. It maybe
(ufficient to fay, that while I regret extremely the
failure of the late negociation for peace with the
Creek Indians, lam fatisfied that the explanations
which have been obtained through authentic chan
nels will be of eminent service. lam also convin
ced that nothing will be wanting on your part to
concur in the accomplishment of a pacification ;
and I still hope, that under the influence of the
general government that desirable objecfl may be
effected. With refpeift to this fubjedlin general,
as well as to the other calamity which you men
tion as resulting from your being the South fron
tier of the Union, I requeftyou will be persuaded
that I shall make such use of the powers inverted
in me by the constitution as may appear to be best
calculated to promote the public good.
I am much pleased, gentlemen, with the frank -
ness which you have manifelted in regard to my
felf, and return you my hearty thanks for the
good wishes you have exprefled for my health and
happinrfsâwith a sincere prayer that the fame
bleflings may be extended to you and your con
ftituents G. WASHINGTON.

X-J Diltrict of Massachusetts was opened iq this town. No bufi
l came before the Grand Jury at this Conrt. Two actions, lor
breaches of the Revenue Law, were tried before the Petit Jury, in
the name of the Unued States. The bufinefc being finiflred, the
Court adjourned on Thursday morning.
At the opening of this Court, the Hon. Judge LOWELL gave
a Charge to the Grand Juryâof which the lollowing is an extract.
" AS the prevention of offences is much more ufeful to the com
munity, than the detection and puniffiment of them, it canno" be
improper, at the commencement of a new government, to make
such observations to those whose bus.ness it is to inquiri concern!
If the government lately eftaolifced, or any national govern
ment, is necessary for the peace, fafety aâd happ, ne fs of the^ui-
ZenS '/ America, there .s one thing which especially require, the r
very fer.ous attentionâl mean the REVENUEâwhich u r.ee
fary to enable u to do juft.ee toil,creditor,, ,0 re-establish it, ere
dit and to exercise the powers and functions of government
in short without which it cannot ex,ft. Before the revolution in
Amcnca, when the regulation of our trade was in the hands of a
government m which we had no (bare, and by the operations of
which whatever was taken from our citizens lessened '"he burthen
of their own, the revenue laws were oonf.dered a. a grievance - and
the interests and paftions of individuals running in the fame course
with the general fent.ment, and the too lax morals of some o fÂ°heir
officers having left them open to corrupt Draft ices th, - r r
those laws was eonfidered by some as iuftifiable and K 10 Â° Â°
but a venial fault 1,1 habits are haVd so break tL Y TrooLd
path, once entered, is apt to lead U s further astray. Have we not
some reason to tear that the fem.ments so imbibed may bÂ£wÂ£
brought into action ? But if we consider that to defeat our reve", e
l<tws will be to destroy our goverument and fh Â» i 5
and impede them will engraft aVfV"
the neceflity of new laws to extend the source, and'mak" Â«n !he
deficences-that new checks and penalties must be created* and
the expeoce of the eollefhon wiU be thereby enormously increased
âcan we hefyate to declare, that it is the d'utv of â r âj ' . rca,ec <

QN Monday morning, thei s thiull. as Mr Van
W Renffelaer, foil of Gen. Henry K. Van R eilf "
felaer, and his fitter, were accompanying the r
cpufins, two of the daughters of Col. John Vis
fcher-, of Green Bush, to their father's, in a fleWi*
the ice of the river broke in, within a few yards
of the end of their journey, nearly opposite
houfeof Volkert P Douw, Esq. Their cries were
soon, providentially,heard by Mr. Douw's family
and his negroes ran to give afliftance. When'
they arrived at the place-the sleigh and the hair
of Mr. lienflelaer s head were alone to be seen
a board, that one of the negroes had brought
was then put under Mr. R. and he was firft fnatcl/
ed from deftrudtion. MifsÃenflelaer immediate!
ly emerged, near her brother, and was also f av
ved. The eldest Miss VilTcher was next drawn
upon the ice, but sisterly affection checked every
rising fear for felf-prefervation, and as she was
extending the hand of afliftance to her expiring
lifter, the ice again broke, and they were both
instantly abforded by the eddy, out of everv
reach.---The eldest Miss Viflbher was 21 yearsof
age, and was to have been married in a few days
the younger was in her i6rh year.âEvery ex'
ertion has been made to find the bodies, but that
of the eldest only has been found. The horses
had fallen into the river with so great velocity
that they broke the traces, plunged under the
ice, and were not to be seen after the negroes ar
rived.--- 1 his fatal spot has been open the whole
winter, till within two days of the accident.
The ice in it was only three inches thick but
within a few feet round, it was eighteen. '
Reader! pa use a moment, and lay to heart
this melancholy example of the uncertainty of
life. Be warned by the fate of these two amia
ble young ladies, that such also may be yours
Life,at itslongeft extent,is short. Few live tothe
evening of the day of Life. When haply one
has seen the fun fink in the horizon, if he reflects
how many does he recoiled to have dropped
down in every hour of the day. Think of this
