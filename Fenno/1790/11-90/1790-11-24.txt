Discourses on Davila.
I'tiumque regem, fua multitado conlalulavcrat
THE Prince of Condi and the Admiral, irri
tated to fee fupprefled a party, upon wliofe
Dumber and forces they had founded aJI their
hopes, and not being able to hinder the executi
on of the Edict, which all the parliaments and
1110 ft of the inferior tribunals prefled into execu
tion with great ardor, imagined another expedr-'
ent : it was to engage the ministers of the Hu
gonots to demand a public conferrence, in pre
sence of the King, with the Catholic Prelates, up
on the controverted points. This indirect me
thod appeared to them proper to obtain infenfi
bly, a liberty of conscience. The Cardinal di
Tournon, and several other Catholic Prelates, op
posed this request : they remonstrated that it was
useless to dispute about religion, with people who
were very obstinate, and who perlifted in a doc
trine condemned by the church. That if they
â wilhed to lay open- their reasons, they might ad
dress themselves to the council of Trent. The.
Cardinal of Lorrain was of opinion in favor of
the conference ; whether he flattered himfelt
that he fliould confound the Hugonots, byhisir
refiftable realoning, and convince those whom he
thought seduced, or whether, as those who envi
ed him gave our, by making an ostentatious ex
hibition of his eloquence and erudition, he wilhed
itill further to increafehis reputation and gloiy,
in so celebrated an aflembly : Whatever were
his intentions, it is certain that by not opposing
the demand ofthe Protestants, he draws into his
sentiment the prelates, who yielded to the soli
citations of the King of Navarre. This Prince,
who had long desired to hear a dispute in form,
between the Catholics and Hugonots, to clear up
his own doubts, supported with warmth the de
i'afe condutis to the ministers refugees at Gene
va, and assigned for the place of conference Poify,
a little city, five leagues from Paris.
The King appeared at Poify, with all his court,
accompanied by the Cardinals of* Bourbon, of
Lorrain, of Tournon, of Armagnac, and o iGuife,
who were to aifift at the conference on the part
of the Catholics. Themoft diftinguilhed Bish
ops and Prelates, several Dotfors oftheSorbonne,
and other Theologians of the molt celebrated
universities ofthe kingdom,were present. There
appeared on the fide of the Hugonots, Theodore
Beza, Peter Martyr Vermilly, Francis de Saint Paul,
Jthn Raymond, John Virel, with several others,
who came from Geneva, or Germany. Bezaex
plained his doctrines, with great pomp of elo
quence ; and the Cardinal of Lorrain answered
him, with what he called proofs and authorities,
drawn from the Scriptures and the fathers of the
Church. The council judged proper to with
draw the young King, because the tenderness of
liis age not permitting him to discern the truth,
there was reason to fear, that he might be sur
prized by some dangerous opinion, contrary to
rhe faith. After several debates, the alTenibly
separated without deciding any thing.
The Catholics gained only one advantage :
The King of Navarre was not fatisfied with the
Hugonots, having oblerved some variations of
their minillers in the do<itrines which they main
tained. Some followed literally the sentiments
of Calvin ; others inclined to the dotftrine ofLu
ther ; these adhered to the profeffion of faith of
the Swiss, those to the confeffion of Augfbourg.
Shocked with this inconsistency, as he thought it,
this weak Prince began to be disgusted with the
jievv opinions, and to attach himfelf to the Catho
lic religion. But the Hugonots drew from this
conference all the fruit that they had promised
thcmfelves. As soon as they came out of it, they
boasted highly that they had denionftrated the
truth of their belief, convinced the Catholic doc
tors, confounded the Cardinal of Lorrain, and
obtained of the King permiflion to preach their
dotftrine. In fa<S, of their own private authori
ty, they began to aflemble, wherever they pleas
ed, to hold publickly their sermons, with so great
an affluence of people, and so great a concourse
of nobility, as well as others, that it was no long
er polfible to restrain them.
When the magistrates attempted to hinder
their assemblies, or the Catholics attempted to
chafe them from the churches where they met,
the Hugonots run to arms, and defended them
selves. The two parties attacked each other

Largely had Gov. Bowdoin shared in the diftinftions of the
world. To the honor of Harvard College, he was educated at
that Seminary of Learning ; and so highly was he diflinguilhcd
for his ablitics, that at a very early age he was eletted a Represen
tative of the town of Boston, in which office he was continued,
until he was ele&ed one of the Council of the then Province of
MalFachuietts Bay, where he served with great reputation, until
negatived by Governors Bernard and Gage, for his decided
and able opposition to British measures. He took a diftinguifh
cd part in the revolution, having been President of the Council of
this State, for a number of years during the war ; was President
of the Convention that formed the State Conffcitution, and since
the levolution, he has been Governor of this Commonwealth.
He died President of the Acadsmy of Arts and Sciences, in this
State ; President of the Humane Society ; Do&or of Laws in the
Universities of Cambridge and Edinburgh ; Fellow of the Royal
Societies of London and Dublin, and of the Society of Arts in
Great Britain.
No trait in his chara&er was perhaps more distinguished, than
his last, his death : Infpircd by religion, and upheld by the father
of mercies, he endured a most painful sickness, with the grcateft
firmnefs and patience; and received the stroke of death, with a
calmness, a resignation, and composure, that marked the truly great
and good man. Thus has died, if not the pride, at Icaft one of
the brightcft ornaments of his country, and of human nature.

PARTICULARS OF THE LATE FIRE, AT MADRID.
This dreadful fire, that has been burning up
wards of ten days, has nearly deflroyed in l'lace

- i.Lua par.: '.i, t 14.11 sroiv oi'liouics of an ad
jacent ltreet, upwards of 80 in all, have already
fallen a prey to the flames ; which the public
prayers, many soldiers and workmen, with a
small engine, and several squirts, have not been
able to extinguifli. The firs began at midnight :
forthwith the miraculous image of St. Roch was
uncovered and brought, in procession, to the
square, but the conflagration, notwithstanding
the presence of the Saint, and the fervent pray
ers of the multitude, did not rage with less vio
lence. The holy sacrament succeeded but with
as little success ; the Duke of Medina Celithen
substituted the sacred image of our Saviour, be
longing to the Capuchin's convent in his hotel.
Tliefe i'ucceflive pious efforts lasted more than fix
hours, during which time it was visible the
workmen preferred prayers to exertions. The
Dominicans have been reproached with having
refufed to bring forth our lady of Atocha, a Ma
donna, who never fails of success. The fire, it is
said, was owing to a private gentleman's devoti
on, who kept, night and day, many lighted ta
pers before the shrine of a wonderful image.
Wednesday evening the NewYearwas ushered
in by the Jews, with that foleninity which diftin
guiflies that holiday from all others. The nieu
appeared in their different Synagogues eloatlied
in shrouds ; the women all in white ; which cast
a very awful refle<stion on the ungodly among
them ; for it is presumed, that on that feftival

and on that account the [ews invoke angels, pa
triarchs, and deceased friends, to intercede for
their iniquities.
After the conquelt of Zettin, the Turks were
conltrained in their flight to abandon a great
number of children ; previous to which they fatt
ened round the necks ofthefe little unfortunates,
a note, on which was written as follows : " May
the God of mercy inspire with pity those intÂ»,
whose hands this innocent child may fall. Praise
and glory to thee, all-merciful God ; Thou haft
formed man for life. Wherefore dost tlioufuffir
thy children to deltroy eath other ?âAh ! nii
ferable orphans ! Abandoned by the aufhor of
thy existenceâGod alone sail be thy guide and
thy ptotedtor." ,
Our Northern neighbours punish/with exem

up with breath ifl'uing from lungs infetfled, per

well known to be rankpoifon.

A letter from Philadelphia has the following
paragraph t " Our trade is rapidly increasing,
and particularly our China trade, which has met
with the utmost success. Two of our China vel
fels have just arrived with valuable cargoes; the
deirfand for Indian goods is very conllderable.
Philadelphia promises fairly to become a pro

ufeful than ieftrudlive ; for a pair of those birds,
during the dme they have their young to feed,

discovered tljat the two parents carried to the

which is a daily consumption of 480 ; this multi

Extratt of a letter from Paris, Sept. 7.
Â« The manner of doing business in this king
dom isnow such, especially with Foreign Ambaf
fadors,that no absolute certainty of measures can
bÂ» come at. Mirabeau, for the moment, does
every thing ; but it is to be hoped, his power
will not lalt. The doctrine of war is his ; the
liegociation with foreign ministers is direded by
him. The King has no more power than an in
fant. His ministers areinfignificant. Everything
centers in the Aflemblyâand there half a dozen
men govern absolutely. Things are coming fact
to a crisisâwhich mnft end in a civil or foreign
war. Perhaps this devoted country may exper
ience the horrible consequences of both.

-with a llight return of his complaint, which he

Authentic particulars ofthe dreadful affair at Nancy,
from M. Bouille's Letters to the National Jjjcmbly,
dated Nancy, Sept. I.
Since my entrance into this city I have not had
a moment to spare, to fend a regular account oi
my conduct, and of the present state of thing!

of the National Assembly ; and from their man

order to execute the decree.
At ten o'clock, on the road from Pont a MouT
Ton to Nancy, I was met by a deputation fromthf
Municipality and tlÂ»e garrison of Nancy. My an

from the walls. _

While the soldiers were going out of the othei

PARISIAN INTELLIGENCE
National Assembly
M. V iellard,from the Commitee ofÃeports,
gave an account of some horrid excefies lately
committed in tHe city of Moutaubon. The peo
ple of this city being heated and inflamed by the
seditious writings that have been industriously
dispersed by the clergy and the enemies of liberty,
collected in great bodies, and refilled the Muni
cipal officers in the exercise of their duty, com
mitted the greatett cruelties upon the Proteftanti,
650
and had killed numbers of theft unfortunate
people. Five of the officers of the National guard
were also killed by these wretched fanatics. la
fliort, the city ofMontaubon was one fccne of
blood. The Afl'embly, after some debate on this
fubiedt pafled the following decree : The Na
tional Afl'embly being informed of the troubles
which prevail in tb* city ofMontaubon, and from
a conviction that it is their duty to delay no time
in gaining light into'the horrid excefles that: lav* ,
been there comined, decree, that the President
wait immediately on tbe King, and entreat him
I to take the ncceflary steps for reftpring tranquili
ty to the city, to give orders for all the citizens 1
to wear the national cockade, and that all Pro
testants and others, not of the Catholic faith, be
put under the protection of the laws ; and also
decree that he will inrtantly take the n)oft ex
peditions and efficacious measures that justice
may be done upon those, who, either by negledt
in their several duties, or by seditious combinati
on, have excited and fomented the troubles of â 
that city.
The maflacre of the Protestants at Montaubon
was occasioned by that intolerant rage which the
Clergy of all nations, and of all times, havebeen .
so profligate as to excite in the bafoms of the ig
norant. The Bishop ofMontaubon was wicked
enough to colle<ft the people, and chiefly tbe wo
men and from the churches of his diocese the
female furies, warmed to enthusiasm by the hor
rid dodirlnes of the Priests, and their rage being*
fan<ftionedjby Mafles, were sent forth in all direc
tions, murder and bloodflied, for the
fake of preferviiig their holy religion.
A letter was next read from a great number of
Friars, of the aboliflied Beneditftine Order,
p.laining bitterly of the tyranny of their fuperion, .
in refunng to absolve them of the oaths of super
stition and bigotry ; and another from the Jews
of Paris, craving thedecifion of the Afl'embly on
their fate ; both of whiclj were remitted to the
committee of reports.

turned it into the river. It was taken on the
17th day of the following month, and then it
weighed seventeen pounds and an half.

THE prcCs torfeaincri continues in moll of the British ports;
and uncertainty rests on the -events of Peace or War with
Spain. Accounts from Gibraltar mention fomc recent encroach
ments upon the neutral ground before that fortrefs.
The Duke of Cumberland, brother to the King of England,d ied
the 18th Sept. after a long illness ; he-was in his 47th year; aod
has left no ifiue.
The eilimate of the loss by the late fire at Madrid, is reported

The Emperor of Morocco has declared war againfl Spain.
Another meflengerwas hourly expected from Spain ; matters not

The number of killed and wounded on both fides in the late
mutiny in France, is stated to he upwards of 1600.
The Empress of Ruflia, exasperated againftthe Englilh, hat con

the former, by aiding the Spaniards.
A new league is said to be on the tapis between Rufiit, Spain
and Franceâas a counterbalance to thcalliancc between England,
Pruflia and Holland.
The Austrian army was on its march to Brabant.
The National Guards of France, alarmed by the inflammatory
publicationt which abound in that country, were on their march
to the frontiers of the kingdom, to prevent any inroads of the Aus
trian*; tho it does not appear that Leopold has any design of
interfering in the affairs of France.
The Austrian army, destined to the low countries, amounted to
49.417 men.
Recent accounts from Germany mud afford some very lntereli
ing particulars refpe&ing the coronation and inauguration of the
Emperor ; the state of affairs in the low countries ; the progress
of liberty in Hungary, and in the heart ot the Empire: for the
last accounts from Vienua state that great unealinefs prevailed in
that city on account of the peace made by the King of Prufiia, be
tween Austria and the Turks ; the people appeared hostile to any
coercive measures being adopted against the Brabanters.
Great Britain has guaranteed the duties of the found, to Den
mark : These duties amount to 200,000!. a year.
The affairs of Hungary are in a eritical filiation, and seriously
menace the tranquility of Europe.
The Englifti papers inform of further naval armaments : A larg;e
fleet is ordtrer 1 to be got ready immediately: Its destination is
conjectured to be the Weft-Indies.
Accounts from Martinico in,form, thrt every thing is in confu-
ClOll at that island : Every vessel which arrives from the States
have guards put on board. Guadaloupe is altaoft deserted ; the
men being gone as volunteers to Martinique.
The celebrated Mi. Bruce, whofetravels into Abyflinla have
lately been published, gives an account ot the sources of the Nile,
which never had been before traced by any traveller, nor was the
world in poflcflion of any fatisfa&ory account of its origin. It
may however be observed, that his diicovcries confirm the conjec
tures of some former travellers, who had supposed that the head of
that famous river, like that of most others, terminated in inconsi
derable springs and rivulets.

of the United States, intitled, " An ad making provfion for the
Â« debt of the United Statesfo far as the fame pledges the taith of
the United States, and appropriates funds for the payment of cer
tain debts $ue by the several states in the union, will in its opera
tion be highly injurious to those states, which have by persevering
and ftrenuousexertions,redeemed a considerable proportion of the
debt incurred by them* dur.ng the late war, and will particulaily
produce great injury to this state ; because a large portion of the
debt then contra&ed by this Commonwealth, having been alieady.
redeemed by the colle&ion of heavy taxes levied on its citizens,and
measures having been taken for the gradual payment of the balance,
so as to afford the most certain profpe&of extinguiftung the whole
at a period notary distant : the Commonwealth will, by the o
peration of the aforefaid ast, be involved for the payment of debit
contrasted by other states, which either have not paid any part
thereof themselves, or have reduced them but in a small proportion
compared with the payments made by this ftate,by means where
of a heavy debt will be intailed on this state, which never can be
extinguiftied by all its efforts, whilst any part ot the debts con.
traded by any state in the American union, and so aliumed lhali
remain unpaid.

AN AUTHENTIC STATEMENT OF
AFFAIRS IN FRANCE,
From the \Ji to the 12th of Sept. 1790.
THE great difficulties undei which the National Aflembly la
bours, seem rather to encreafe its energy than to depress its
coyrage. The last, and one of the mod important parts of the
constitution, is completed ; the chambers oj vacation are no more;
they were the last remnants of the parliaments ; they are replaced
by justices of the peace, diftrift and department judges.
The finances being now the immediate objett of national con
cern, a concise statement has been laid before the houte, by Mr.
Montefquioui member of the committee of finance. This is too
important not to intcreft an American reader.
" Mr. Monteftjuiou carries the actual amount of public contri
butions to 497 millions, which however, will not be fufficient tor
the expenditure : this will require an addition c 55 millions.
" He divides the public debt into two parts; the ancient debt
of the kingdom, and the debt lately contracted by the nation.
" t. As to the ancient debt, ifs reimbursement is not due, as
it consists principally in annuities ; therefore provifiou is only to
be made for the payment of these annuities.
" 2. The debt lately contra&cd is of a different nature,becaufe
the capital is immediately to be paid. This debt comprehends
the afTumption of the debt of the clergy, the reimbursement of
all officers of the ancient parliaments and of finance, anticipations,
debt of the king and queen's houdiold, public loans in Holland
and Genoa, and other loans. All these objetts amount to the
sum of 1900 millions.
" To pay the interest of these 1900 millions it would be neces
sary to raise the public revenue from 497 millions to 521, inde
pendent of the deficit of 55 millions above mentioned, and inde
pendent of the annual expence of public worship now payable by
the nation. To provide for this extraordinary debt, the nation
has acquired a fund of 2400 millions in domains and church
lands, which properly applied are more than fufficient to latisfy
its creditors, or rather to pay the expence of this great revolution.
14 The committee submits to the wisdom of the AiTembly three
different ways to complete this payment :
" 1. By certificates bearing an interest. 5 per cent, to be re
ceived in payment for domain and church land.
44 2. By ciffignats upon the said land, bearing no interest.
44 3. By delivering certificates for half the fuin due, and aflig
nats for the other half."
This plan presented towards the end of August, was strongly
supported by Mr. Mirabcau> who insisted upon the immediate
ernillion of aooo millions of aflignats, receivable ir. all payments,
as they a&ually represented the domain and church land. ThÂ»s
measure, said he, would effectually convert the enemies of the
constitution, as by the cmiflion of so large a sum their fortune
would undoubtedly depend on the support of the national decrees.
>âThe AiTembly having adjourned this important question to the
17th of September, the public have had time to consider it with
attention. Mr. Mirabeau's opinion has been adopted by the
Chamber of Commerce of Bourdeaux, who addressed the nation
al AiTembly on the fubjeft.âMany adversaries appear on the other
fide, amongst whom Mr. Ncckcr is the most eminent, (hewing,
in a pSrticular memoir to the AflemblyÂ» how much commerce,
agriculture and administration would be injured by this immense
cmiflion of paper-money. Mr. Dupont supports the fame opin
ion in a pamphlet, and the city of Rouen in anaddrefs to the Na
tional AiTembly. The latter propofesthe firft alternative of the
committee as the most eligible, viz. to pay in certificates, bearing
an interest of 5 perccnt.
Mr. Necker's reasons against the emiflion of 2000 millions of af
fignats are indeed strong and weighty ; but it may be asked wha*
right this roinifter had to interfere in the deliberations of the Le
gislature ? Besides, Mr. Necker only disapproves the plan, but he
does not propose a better one. Bourdcaux and Rouen have open
ly declared themselves for and against the emi(lion of afligtiats ; the
public are almost equally divided, and the decision of the AfTem
bly, whofedebatesonthe fubjeÂ£t are to begin the 17th,uncertain.
The enormous debt of 1900 millions, incurred by the AfTem
bly, will not appear so exorbitant, when we consider that com
mon juflice required that the nation (hould aflume the debt of the
Â«lcrgy and royal family, provide lor the (Ã¼bfiftence of bilhops and
monks, refund the capital formerly paid for judiciary and finance
offices, and make up the lolTes of the royal treasury fuft'ained by
the irregularity of contributions. Wc have seen that the means to
provide for thefeobjetts will be easy, but the mast eligible mode
_ J
must be left to the wifdoro and enquiry of tbe Niuonal Atftui
b, 'fhe moderation and circumfpcdlion of this great
been lately evidenced in the delicate ijueftion o â â 
Avi-non. Mr. Trouchet,making a report on this luDjett, oblcivca
thdtÂ°the Pope bcinÂ« in pofleffion of Avignon fincc: 1348, h
rights were as refpcftable as any rights of property ~ that: the a
tiztrls of a particular diftria had not the faculty of gwg
selves to another power without the coufent o re w
nity to which they belong; that therefore Av.gnon could nobe
accepted bV France, unless all the States of the d collcc
tively consented to .his surrender, and that ever. ... that cafe the
negotiations (hould originate between the A.ng and Pope and
not between the Aflembly of France and the people Â«f Avignon.
The majority of the Aflembly feemeo to approve this repot t, but
deferred the ultimate dccif.on to another day.
M de U Tour clu. Pin, tninifterof the war department, has in
formed the Aflembly, that altho' the king had not the least fu -
picion with relpeft to the intentions of the King of Hungary, it.)
the great bodies of troops marching towards Brabant tendered it
necessary to quiet the minds of the people on the frontiers, by re
inforcing them with reeiments. This letter was .efcrred
to the military committee. The armaments at Bred, Rocheiott
1 and Toulon, are carried on with ihe greatest dispatch.
According to a decree of the National Aflembly, all parlia
mentary functions of ihf chambers of vacation were to ceale the
â joth of Sept. in the jyjjvinces, and the isth October at Parts.
About that time the juices and a.ttrift judges -wcrc to be
chosen by the fame electors who have the appointment of diftnfl
aflemblies. The fame electors were hkewlfe to cleft bishops and
curates. Thus we have seen, in the course of one year, a com
plete regeneration of an irnraenfe empire ; twelve large provin
ces divided into 85 departments, each department into diftrifts,
each diftria into parishes; a progreflive representation from the
smallest village to the whole empire ; a large body of nobles le
velled with the citizens ; some hundred thousand monks reltored
to the community ; hereditary judges replaced by eleÂ£ted justices;
the road to honor and preferments opened to all ranks, to all reli
gions ; a domineering soldiery taught to obey the civil magistrate.
Whatever may be the defedls of individual members of the Na
tional Aflembly, we are at a loss to find in history a body of men,
who have displayed more courage, more firmnefs, more wisdom,
and who in a shorter fpaceof time have done greater things than
the Aflembly of I ranee.
Candour oblige* us to fay, however, that notwithstanding the
great prefeverance and afliduity of the national Aflembly, the
country is far trom being in a state of tranquillity* The enemies
of liberty are too numerous and too daring not to excite commo
tions, which though diftrefling for the immediate futferers, are far
from being prejudicial to that system which they wish to destroy.
From the beginning of the revolution to this day, every attempt of
the opposite party has been not only unfuccesful but ruinous for
them. While we deploie their blindness, we sincerely wish that
they may not wound the feelings of a patriotic and virtuous King,
b/ their pretended counter-revolution; luch an attempt would
4 *uin foi ever an ancient and yefpeftable nobility, which is still dear
to their country, tho' they are deprived of the empty iound of ti
tles, which like the names of Peter and John, have of late seldom
conveyed a higher opinion of the man to the ear ot a Frenchman.
Families are and will be always refpe&ed, if, by an imprudent ex
ertion, they do not forfeit the affection of their countrymen. We
acknowledge that they may bring on a civil war, a war which must
annihilate tnem, but we deny the practicability of a counter revo
lution. Separate attempts indeed are made in several parts of the
kingdom, but they always terminate in the deftruftion of the ring
leaders. The mod remarkable is the late commotion of Nancy,
where the Swiss regiment of Chateauvieux milled by falfe mfinu
ations, had taken arms against the commander, Marquis de Bouille,
a man distinguished by his conduct in the Weft-Indies,during the
late war. Supported by iome citizens, the rebellious regiment
actually attempted to defend the city against the approaching mi
litia, commanded by M. dc Bouille, who had given previous notice
of his expedition to the National Assembly. The militia having
forced one of the gates, a great slaughter ensued, in which about
300 men were killed on both fides : but M. dc Bouille proving ul
timately vi&orious, the prisoners were committed to a court mar
tial of their countrymen [the Swiss} who condemned every fe
; venth man to be hanged, and 64 of the reft to the galleys. During
the confli&an officer of the Kings regiment, perceiving that the
Swiss intended to fire a cannon on the militia, placed hirnfelf be
fore the mouth of the cannon, devoting himfelftoa gloriousdeath
to save his fellow citizen?. The conduct of Mr. Bouille, was high
ly approved of by the King and Aflembly; but the difafi'efted
party embraced with eagern.fs this opportunity to misrepresent
the conduct of the gene ral and ministers; they inflamed the peo
ple of Paris to such a degree as to render it neceflary for Mr. De
la Fayette to reinforce the guards of the National Aflembly and ot
the Ministers; it was (aid that the militia and the regiment had
been wantonly facrificcd to the fecrel views of M. dc Bouille, who
after having butchered those who were evidently attatched to the
constitution, would find it very easy afterwards to bringon a coun
ter revolution. Afperfionjs of this kind,however,have a momentary
efleft at Paris, and the commotions which they excite have folittle
influence in the Aflembly, that whilst the mob aflailed the house,
they continued the whole day to deliberate coolly on the ceflion
of Avignon. Nothing has yet been able to break the undaunted
spirit of that patriotic body. Smaller commotions of regiments
at Lisle, and in other places, hardly deserve to be mentioned, hav
ing been flopped immediately by the new created power of the
civil inagiftrate : A power which is daily ftrcngthened by the
fruitlefs struggles of a soldiery, unaccustomed to the controulof
civil law.
The King having been at St. Cloud about fix weeks, it can be
110 more aflerted by the enemies of the constitution, that his ac
tions are not free. He continues to co-operate with the National
Afleiubly in the raoft eflential points of their proceedings; for
their decrees can not be executed but under his authority. In his
name M. de Montmorin has informed the Aflembly, that every
necessary measure has been taken to support the family compact with
Spain, and that the Ambaflador at Madrid has received in
ftru6lions to renew thr; trertv under the name of a national compad.
Thus in the earliest peÂ»)jd of the French regeneration, the future
political connexions ot the kingdom will be defined, and the edi
fice gradually completed in all its parts.
By way of contrail to thefc great concerns of the nation, we
can not forbear mentioning the voluminous memorial lately pre
sented by threle&orof Triers to the States of the German Empire.
He com plains of thedecree, which by rendering the French church
entirely independent of foreign controul, deprives him of his cc
clefiaftical jurifdi&ionover Merit*, Toul, Verdun, Nanci,St. Deiz,
the Dutchy of Lorrain, and part of Luxembourg. His highness
claims the protection and afliftance of the empire against these
dangerous encroachments on his authority. If, in consequence of
his claims, thcjacrcd empire fends into France an army similar to
that which has lately attacked the Liegeois, we (hall remember the
cxpreflion of Mr. Mirabeau : â¢' We hope that the Germans will
not oblige us to bury some thousands of their soldiers upon our
frontiers."
The Pope continues his ncgociations with refpeft to Avignon,
and from the disposition of the National Aflembly, it is difficult
to fay what will be the result.
The declining health of Mr. Necker has at last induced him to
depart, but being unable to fettle li s accounts he left that bufiuefs
to M. Dufrefney and let out with his lady, about the 9th of Sept.
He was flopped by the militia of Arey, a small town in Champam,
who refufed to let him proceed without leave from the National
Aflembly. Mr. Necker wrote in consequence to the Aflembly,
who, alter some debate, ordered the municipality of Arey to fuf

crea't talents, intcg.ity and perseverance ot this great man, he w is

We cannot better conclude this short statement of the affairs in
France, than by mentioning the new tribute paid to the memory
oi a man, who, as a itatefman, as a ph.lofopher, but particularly as
an American, has for ever gained the applause and esteem of
the French natidn. The Academy lias decreed the highest pre
mium for the next year, on an encomium of Dr.FRANKLiN.
Thus the legiflaiure, the people, and the lanftuary of letter., have
combined to contribute to the iromo'tality of Franklin, bccaufc
joined to all his superior qualifications, he had the particular ad
vantage of being a distinguished citizen of the United States.

OBSERVATIONS, designed for the benefit of
those who barrel PORK ; which being the re
sult of experience, may certainly be depended
on> A Merchant.
IT is well known that Irish provisions have been, and frill are
generally used throughout Europe : The quality is a good re
commendation, and the mode of preserving them contributes, in
no small degree, to their value; yet there is another point in which
they difFer from the fait provisions of almost every other country,
simple in itfelf, yet extremely ufcful, as it saves labor in thediftri
bution, and of course gives it the preference to those who have the
power of approving 01* dilcountenancing it. I mean, that they
are cut in pieces of a proper size to suit a small mets, both of a na
vy or army. If American Pork, of the firft quality (a cask of which
inthisftate, must now weigh 2001b5.) was manuta&ured in the
fame manner, viz. fifty pieces of about four pounds each in
barrel, it would command not only a ready sale at foreign mar
kets, but it vyouVd alio produce a better price ; and as this mode
of curing it can be attended with 110 poflible injury at any market,
it isearneftly recommended to all dealers in Pork, that they will
begin and promote a system which, ifpradlifed, mull tend to their
)wn emolument, and the good of their country.
