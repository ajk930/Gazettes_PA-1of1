To the PUBLIC
AT this important crisis, the ideas that fill the mind, are preg
nant with events of the greatcft magnitudeâto strengthen and
complete the union of the .Statesâto extend and protect their
commerceâto explore and arrange the national fundi âto restore and
cftablifh the public creditâwill require the energies of the patriots
and sages of nui country âHence the propriety of encreafing the me
diums ojknowledge and information.
AMERICA, from this period begins her national existenceâ
11 the world is all before her"âthe wisdom and fol
lyâthe misery and prosperity of the empties, fates, and kingdoms,
which have had their day npon the great theatre of time, and are
now no more, suggest the most important mementos âtnefe, with
the rapid series of events, in which our country has been involved,
have taught the enlightened citizens of the United States, that free
dom and government âliberty and laws, are inseparable.
This conviction led to the adoption of the new constitution ;
for however various the sentiments, refpe&ing the merits of this
fyftcm, all good men are agreed in the necefliry of an efficient fe
deral government.
A paper, therefore, eftabliftied upon national, independent, and
impartial principlesâwhich lhall t3ke up thepremifed articles,upon
a competent plan, it is presumed, will be highly intercfting,
and meet with public approbation and patronage.
The Editor of this publication is determined to leave no avenue
of information unexplored :âHe solicits the afliftance oi persons

Among the innumerable blelfings derived to
the people of tlie United States from the present
general government, there is none productive
of happier effe&s than that spirit of universal
citizenship which has in a great measure era
dicated party and local dillintftions,and now forms
a great national feature in the American charac

takes his station in the capital of the United

EXPERIMENTS 011 the SARAGHTOGA WA

From a Communication to Stephen Van Wyck, Esq.
By Samuel L. Mitchell, Esq. M. D. in Republ.

Ebor. LXX i'in ; ire. ire.
" 'T'HE temperature of the surrounding
-I- atmosphere being ar the fifty eighth
degree of Farenheit's scale, the heat of the up
permost Spring was forty nine and an half de
grees ; thatol the lower fifty-one and a half.
Corrojive fublhuatc of Mercury when difl'olved
in the water, underwent mo perceptible altera
tion. As this substance was not decompounded,
it is clear there was no Alkali present in the
Spring, in its aerated (late.
Aerated fixed vegetable Alkali rendered the wa
ter turbid, and a white precipitate foonfell down
in large quantity. A plain indication of earth
didblved in the water.
The kind and quality of this earth was striking
ly shewn by the following experiments. I. Solu
tion of Soap in Alkohol was quickly deconipofed.
2. Acid of Sugar very speedily threw down a co
pious white precipitate. This last was exceed
ingly beautiful, and proved the quantity of Lms
to be remarkably abundant
To determine whether the Vitriolic and Muri
atic acids were contained in the water, the two
ensuing experiments were made. i. A folvtion
of Silver in the Nitrous Acid, became very white
and niilk-like, inllantlyon being added. 2. An
aqueous solution of acetated Lead, was precipitated
immediately after mixture, in the form of a white
powder. Whence it is presumable the water
contains both Glauber's Salt and Sea-Salt, especi
ally since much saline matter is afforded, by eva
poration.
Green Vitriol at firft diflolved readily, but af
terwards onftanding, a yellowilh ochre was de
posited
Lunar Caustic, was instantly decomposed, white
locculi rose plentifully to the top of the water,
ind floated there, forming white striae as they
palled upwards ; within a minute they loft their
whiteness, in a considerable degree, became of
an ash or dove-colour, and funk one after another
to the bottom. The whole liquor then appeared
turpid and somewhat purple.
Lastly, the presence of Iron was proved by
these two experiments. I. Phlogijlicated Alkali
aflumed on mixture, a blue colour. 2. Saturat
ed Tinflure of Galls in Alkohol, acquired fomewliat
of a purple hue. The chalybeate impregnation
is however weak, for the quantity of ferruginous
matter is Anall, and contained in the upperinoft
spring only.
Froin which experiments, and from those for
merly published on the fame fubjecft, it is evident
the Saraghtoga waters contain as principal ingre
dients : 1. acid. 2. Lime. 3. Sea-salt. 4.
Glauber's Salt. 5. Iron.
Much remains to be said on their medicinal
qualities and effects ; but I shall Itop here for the
present, with recommending to the curious,an at
tentive perusal of Sir Forbcru Birgman's truly
fcientific and elaborate Eflay on the Artalyft.f of
Waters, whenever they visit mineral springs."
MR. FEN NO,
WE are sorry to learn that the Whtat hifift
has not yet ceased to be troublesome. COll
- damage has been done already to those
crops which were sowed early ; insomuch that
the farmers in some places have plowed up some
oftheir Wheat-fields and sowed Rye. The liif
cory of this animal is now so well understood,
that it is in the power of Farmers to avoid much
of its mifchief, by committing their feed to the
ground as late in the season as it will poflibly
bear. This willkfiep the infecft asyay until spring;
639
HESSIAN FLY
Ukso
and then if the land be rich and well manured,
vegetation will proceed so fact with the advance
of the warm season that the Wheat will outgrow
it. 1 he-le are matters of great importance, and
ought to be attended to by all friends to the agri
cultural interest. It is much to be feared the Fly
will never wholly leave our country, but remain
a perpetual obstacle to the raising of Wheat.â
But this idea, so far from discouraging, ought
rather to incite us to lome extraordinary exertion
to surmount the difficulty. One of our citizens,*
we are informed, hasfentto some of the Natural
iftsin Europe, specimens of the Heffian-FJy, that
it may be certainly decided whether the species
be new or not ; and whether like damage has
ever happened in that part of the globe from a
limilar cause.
* Dr. Mitchell. As appears by his Epiftola ad Prof. Wal

And likewi-fe, from his'communication to the President of the
Roval Society : " Thus by the two-fold operation ot Erojion and
" Prejfuie have our harvrftsbeenmiferably deilroyed for a uumb< r

LETTER
From a refpcflablc commercial houfc in L* Orient to a gertfemanin Bojlon,
SIR,
" ' I ""HE cffcft of our late glorious revolution, operating on
JL commcrce as well as politicks, and some material changes
having already taken place inconsequence, we embraccthisas a ia
vourable moment to renew our a/pe&s, and acknowledgments, to
our correspondents at large, when we can have any interellinT
information to give them, as well conceining the general trade
of the kingdom, as what relates to this port in particular, whose
luperior advantages justly entitle it to a preference over others,
from its vicinity to the main ocean, the convenience and fafetv
of its harbour, and the trifling charges vessels are liable to on
entiy, as mentioned in our price current which we annex tor
your information and government.
" The changes we have to announce are,
t: The fuppreftion of our East-India company,
" The abolkion of the freedom of this port, and,
" The emiflion of government notes.
u The firftmet with much oppolition, but was notwithftandi/ig
decrecd ; so that the trade to India is now laid open, to the ge
neral benefit of the nation, and we think the particular advan
tage of this town, which, joining to its other conveniences, that
ot having the proper warehouses and offices completely eftablifli
ed, and the face of that trade already turned towards it must com
mand a preft ranee, and continue the fixed mart for the sale of
East-India goods, which we presume will be more reaTonable in
future than heretofore.
" The abolition of the freedom of this port met with less op
position, as it wasameafure fought for by the inhabitants, who
tound it only fcrved as an encouragement to fmugling, to the pre
judice ofthe fair trader,whofc intercourse with the icftofthe king
dom was rtftrained, as no article that once cams into the town,
could return by land, or be received at any other of our ports,
without paying duties, as though the town were foreign ; and here
wc must observe, left an idea Ihould go abroad to the contrary,
that the taking away this freedom does not prejudice our trade
with America, your resident at our court was consulted on the bu
fmef-, and nothing being altered refpeÂ£ting the treaty of 1787, our
intercourse with you will be carried on asufual, without any in
creafc of duties or charges, the only difference is the goods must
now be as it were bonded.
" The emiflion of government notes, or aflignats as they are
called, was to supply the want of the circulation of specie, which
was cither hoarded up by the monied people, or sent out of the
kingdom from interested motives, to the great prejudice and even
stagnation of trade ; the amount is limited to four hundred mil
lions of livres, and they are so much preferable to bank notes,
that they bear interest at the rate of 3 per ceut. per ann. are equal
ly transferable, being payable to bearer, and are guaranteed by,
and to be paid from, a property of above eight hundred millions,
late belonging to the clergy, and which is now on sale.
" Our illustrious national assembly, to perfect the great work
it has begun, has many other improvements in agitation, one in
particular, to fix a common standard for weights and mealure*,
in which the co-operation of England is fought for ; but these
are the most interesting changes that have as yet taken place;
there is however another in the reftri&ions they laboured under,
being taken off the tanneries ; soap and starch manufattories,
which though, seemingly of little consequence to you, we men
tion, in the hope that it may encreafe our connexions with your
Stales, by opening a new branch of commcrce, in the exportation
of bark, green hides, tallow and kelp, if those articles abound
with you ; it. may also encreafe the conlumption ot filh oil, which,
as well as whale, are at prcfent of very flow demand, owing to
the quantities imported last season, and every port being over
flocked : whale bone is likewise flack from the fame but
pot and pearl aftieson the contrary are in high demarf<s, nor can

BRUSSELS, Augull it
THE following letter has been received by the Supreme 8.-igic
Congrefi, from commandant Schipplacken, from Hatltce,
the Bth instant.
Gentlemen, . . |
I have the honor to acquaiut von, that having lelt Liege yclt<- r- ,
day at eleven in the forenoon with a body of 1500 men, we took
the town of Herve about half pail seven in the evening, where wc
found our three pieces of cannon, ch. lis, tents, baggage,
I used all the means in my power to prcvcnt/pslla.jc and ditor
der, but they proved abortivf, owing to the !onj[ reimance made
by the Auftrians,and that of fcvtral thouland peafantsand citizens,
who fired at us from the windows, and behind hedges.
Our loss in killed is not very considerable ; but in wounded a
great many. We have had the misfortune to lose the brave lieu
tenant colonel de Reftairig, who was killed by a musket fn >t about
three-quarters of a league from the :ov. n, fired from the houle o.
a peasant, to which we set fire. What contributed molt to the
cataflrophe of the day was, the inhabitants havingle.t their houks,
the soldiers forccd them to discover those who fired on thewi, and
who, on being found, became objects ol their fury.
I am 8c:.
LONDON, August 31
Letters from the continent advise that the wheat, bailey, and
rice harvests, in the fouthem provinces of Sp.iin and pjitu -al
have proved abundant and were well got in about the 241b of July.
The olives, dates, oranges, lemons n giÂ«pes> ;md other autumnal
fruits, were in good order, and promise a plentiful crop.âT he
silk harvest, as itis called, in the worm provinces ol A.idalulin,
Mercia, Valencia, and thediftrict ot La Mancha, was rather lhort
owing to the heavy rains that prevailed, with a (IrongS. \V . wind,
during the working months, whereby a prodigious numbei ot
worms perished. The provision, of all kinds were in general
plentiful, and consequently cheap, oais excepted, tor which there
was a very smart demand at moll of the ports on the Mediter-
ranean.
The dutch fleet, which was lately at Spithead, is now anchor
ed in the Texel. This intelligence was broughtto Portlmouth by
a brig which lett Holland a lew days since.
The French, with their usual activity, arc taking the molt ef
fectual means of spreading over Europe the knowledge neci-fory
to inspire their fellow-creatures with a just sense ol their rank.
French books and papers are piofcribed in every delpotic coun
try. N'lmporte! They have manufactured many thousands ol
handkerchiefs, on which they have primed in all European lan
guages, the declaration of the rights of man, and these handker
chiefs they lent to the fair at Frankfort, the great mart ot Ger
many, and to which the chapmen of all countries come. I hey
weie bought up with avidity, and aie already d per ted over Eu
rope.
The National Aflembly of France have emitted a paper medium,
to the amount of 400,000,000 livres, and funded it on the confis
cated property of the clergy.
M. d'Orleans loses by the decree of France, four millions two
hundred thousand livres per annum a sum almost equal to

BOSTON, October 12
Capt. Russel, in the fliip William, from Pe
terlburgh, put into Falmouth, in England, which
place he left the 9th of September, at which time
the press was as violent as ever, four of his men
â were pressed on board of an EngHfli frigate, but
he got them off again. The Captain of the En
glilh frigate informed him that war mult una
voidably take place very soon. It was said that
the English fleet was very poorly manned, they
having been obliged to take the tag rag of crea
tion in order to get their ships at lea.
From the " "journal de Libsrte," of Aug. 29th,
we have extracted the following paragraph :â
PARIS,Augult 29.
THE horizon, as we have always feared, is
still more and more obscured.âLord Govver,
the Englifli Ambvdludor, dispatched, the day be
fore yelterday, Mr. Shaw, one of the cabinet mes
sengers, with official dispatches for London,
Yelterday morning he sent Mr. Broughton, ano
ther extraordinary meflenger, and 011 the evening
the departure of a third was expecfted. His
Lordship spent all Friday night in preparing dis
patches with his Secretaries. We (hall soon
know, by the result of tliefe dispatches, whether
England has meant all along toquarrel with us ;
For there is certainly nothing in the decree rela
tive to Spain, which can furnWh her with any
reasonable pretence for a quarrel now. We fur
ther add, that no Englishman, who thinks, can
forbear applauding it ; for every independent
nation has, without doubt, the right to watch
overits own welfare and defence.

Yankee The following judicious U.Je '
on Wit, or " The Arc of Joking, ore e\l>
from the ninth number of that paper. ]
THE ART OK JOKING
NOBODY is affronted at being called a wit >
notwithstanding, an injudicious o
wit is apt to affront others. It is inherent J 1 .*' I'*1'*
man nature to Itrive for admiration ; and iej.
love will often triumph over prudence. 1 lie vanity
of exhibiting fine talents is strongly marked n
moil characters ; but many had rather be com
pliiuented for the pofleilion of wit and humo.y
than for the mote excellent qualifications of wil
dom and virtue. This preposterous and 'iÂ»ac
countable vanity, is the eonftant harbinger oflll
- A pcrfo'n, who is ambitious of being
remarked for brilliant atchievements and ilafhy
feats, will not liefitate, in the warmth of his f.i
vorite, hobby horlical pursuit, to risk the loss of
his bell friend, to gain the frivolous honor ol
[peaking a j'lke. . . ..
Whenever the fe.irch after wit leads us into c.j
feCiation, we become insupportable to the patience
of all companies. A man, conscious he deserves
applause, who paufesjn proper places of his con
versation, to bepraifed, will be frequently dilap
painted in the approbation of men of sense.
Wit is at no time more shocking than when
united with wickedtiefs. This detellable combi*
nation, when it is sent into the world under the
denomination of Jluuder, is oftenfive to delicacy,

MR. FEN NO,
I HAVE read with great pleasure the article
which has for sometime pall appeared in
Gazette of the United States, under the title of
" Difconrfts on Davila." The History of France,
written by this celebrated Italian, has never fall
en into my hands ; I have, however, seen it men
tioned by several writers of eminence, as a mas
terly performance. The moil: interesting peri
od of the affairs of France, I find, is comprized in
this historyâviz. The time of the civil wars oc
casioned by the reformation. It is an old obser
vation, " that we reason best from experience."
Every event that has been hitherto detailed by
the author of the Discourses, confirms the lead'ng
sentiment of the writer, and Ihews how deploraÂ«
ble is the condition of mankind, without that
dernier resort of freedom, a free constituti
on, when underthecontroul of despotism, aristo
cracy, or powerful factious leaders of a party.
The natural, irrefragable truths deducible from
the reflections of this nervous and independent
writer, should inspire the free citizens ofthisrif
ing republic, with the most profound veneration
for, and attachment to the constitution of the
United States, which while it holds out the moil
powerful incitements lo a patriotic line of con
duct, secures the equal rights of all ; and by a
happy adoption of the tripple balance, guards and
protects us from the tyranny of the one the few, or
| th emanj.

" Such causes exijl in the United States es are favor-
able to a prosperous and permanent government."
r T"'HK long conceited quellion, whether men can
J- govern themflves, is now fairly brought to
the celt of an experiment. From present appear
ances, there is goo.Â«l renlbn to expciit the point
will he so fettled, as to eltablilh the affirmative
of the queltion. Are not the people of the Uni
ted States in the adtual enjoyment of a free, and
energetic Itate of government ? And may they
not, in the molt proper fenfeof expreilions,befaid
to vet n tbewjehes ? What circuniftances can be
di'cerned, that threaten to dimirtilh either the
energy or the freedom of our government ? Is
11 L the ftateof society fucli, as to include the ef
femi Imperials for forming thole civil institu
tions which will continue long, because there can
never exiit areal'on ora motive for altering them ?
It may be well to enquire, what can have indu
ced so many wife legiilators to doubt the practi
cability of a J"elf -governed people.
The two main objections againfl: conceding to
the point in question are ; fiiltly, that the gener
al character of human nature does not authorise
Juch a concession ; and secondly, that the whole
concurrence of hiitorical teftiinony contradi<fts
the idea, that a people will continue to govern
themlelves, in a cool, a reasonable, and eiiicient
manner. I will make no particular remarks upon
the firft of tliefc objections, because the advocates
of it collecfi theirgeneral notions of human nature
from hiitorical facfts,and therefore both objec'tions
do, in reality, form but one
Politicians give an air of certainty to their in
ferences, when they attempt to prove that men
always vittjl be, exaiflly what they always have
beiu. It will be asked, that as no people ever
â¢wire found, who, properly speaking, did govern
themselves, why may it not be inferred that no
fiich ever uu/l exiftThe fallacy oftbe inference
proceeds from its being extended too far. The
examples that are adducedin support ofthe prin
ciple fhrtuld only be applied to the proof of cases
fmiilar to themselves. A difference in circuni
itances may counteract all the force that is inten
ded to be derived from the comparison. For in
stance, a people who were fnddenly delivered
from a longeltabliflied despotism, and totally ex
onerated from a despot, would neverthelels, by
bad management, soon reduce themselves back to
(despotism. Such an event would authorise an 111 -
ierence, that some other people, exactly so fitua
red, would be in danger of alike dil'alVer. But I
itfurniflies no argument that such a description j
of men, as inhabit the United States, cannot pre
serve themselves from despotism. An ignorant,
servile people cannot govern themselves, because
they have neither knowledge not spirit adequate
to such a pnrpof'e. A turbulent warlike people
will not govern themselves, because their love of
plunder and confufion i* superior to their love of
order and protection. They can neither feel it
to be their interest, nor conceive it to be their
<lnty to encourage mild and equitable institutions.
But it is far otherwise with rel'pecft to a nation,
com po fed of traders, mechanics, and planters, who
have a predilection for their several occupations ;
whose views and competitions generally relate to
private objects of business ; and whose personal
prosperity is perceived to be efientially blended
â with that of the government. When a man, by
lionett industry, has acquired property, _he feels
li solicitude about the protection of it. Why
fiwji should he not be an enemy to faCtion, and to
,/every other cause that really threatens to dissipate
the maxims, and defeat the operations of law and
justice ? The people of the United States will
jiot easily be beguiled into a bad choice of rulers,
because the public opinion is so well informed as
to be competent to decide upo.i the merit of cha
racters ; and it will be found, that the great mass
of individuals know too well what promotes their
own interest and fafety, not to reprobate the idea
of forming alegiflature of weakand wicked men.
Since the new government commenced its ea
reer, it is obvious to the eye of a molt careless 1
obfervcr, that the circumflances as well as the
character cf our inhabitant have meliorated,
l'lie talents discovered in the various executive
departments, and the Confidence which a judici
ous administration has inspired in the public
mind, are conspicuous proofs that an enlightened
people will be bell l'atisfied, when they are belt
governed. It can never be the intereftofone
.branch oftlie community, in a free country, to
delfroy the prosperity of another , nor can the
rich derive such durable advantage over the
poor, by oppreiiive laws, as by thole that are inild
and equitable. When rulers learn that their dig
niiy confiits not in being arbitrary and severe,
they will have 110 motive to aff'ume those attrocious
qualities. When citizens are habituated to the
idea, that their fafety is greater in obeying than
iji opposing the laws, few men will be i'o foolifh
orperverfe, as to join in pernicious combinations
againit the government. (To be continued.)

By Capr. Ward, who arrived at Boston the 23d inft. from Mar

parties in that Island. Count Dainas (the Governor.) the princi
pal planters, the King's troop?, and tree mulattecs, form one
party which is denominated the Royalists ; the other party is
formed of the inhabitants ot Sr. Pierre, and some ot Fort Royal,
who arc called the Revolutionist.*. In a former tumult, the latter
executed f veral mulattoes ; which occasioned the expedition

mulattoes, were apprehended âsome were committed to goal, and
others sent to Fiance.and tranquility wasthere by restored for a time.
Since then the St. Pierre Revolutionijls have demanded of the Go

commenced against those sent to France, stopped, the Mulattoes
disarmed, and Fort Bourbon, put into their possession. fhefe the
1 Governor could not comply with ; but the Revolution Jls found
means to get pblltflion of Fort Bourbon, on which the Governor
and his officers retired to Gourmon, where the Airembly was fit

Utitimquc regem, fua multitudo coulalutavcrat,
EACH party expected its own regent. The
ancient usage, and laws often confirmed by
the States, called of right to the function, the
King of Navarre. But what a reverie ? Whatan
appearance r To confide the person of the young
King, and the government of the kingdom to a
Prince fufpecfled of a conspiracy againlt the llate,
detained as a prisoner, and tile accomplice ofa
brother condemned to death !
The Cuifej had governed with fupreine autho
rity under the late King, and attempted the mod
violent meafurcs. By committing to them the
fame power, it was easy to follow the fame plan
ana execute the fame designs. But they were
not of the royal blood: how, commit to them
the tutorage ofa young King, contrary to all the
laws of the monarchy ? What envy, whatjealou
fy, what oppofiiions would they not have to con
tend with, from the nobility and the grandees,
who would be discontented with their power,and
afpireto despoil them of it ?
The States had fonietimes confided the regen
cy to the mothers of Kings, during their minori
ty, and in the present competition of so many
interests and contending faiftions, it was not pru
dent to place in other hands, the life of the King,
and the conservation of the state.âBut a woman,
a ftr.anger, without partisans, and without sup
port, could (he maintain her ground again It two
Inch powerful factions, ready to support their
pretentions by the force of arms ? The Guises,
forefeeing what might easily happen, leagued
themselves with the Cardinal de Tournon, the
Duke de Nemours, the Mai (hals de Brtjfac and
Saint Andre > Sippisrc, governor of Orleans, and
many other great Lords, with whose influence
they reinforced their party, to defend their lives
and preserve their power. The King of Navarre,
conceiving happier hopes for the future, united,
more strictly than ever, with the Chatillons, the
Admiral and Cardinal, the Prince de Ptrcien,
Jamac, and many others of their partisans. He
secretly armed his friends, and dispatched couri
er after courier to the Constable. The two par
ties, having thus placed themselves in a posture
of defence, the whole court, and the troops di
vided themselves among thein, and even the de
puties of the States took their party, each one fol
lowing his paflions, his interest, or his principles.
Never did the neceflity of a third mediating
power, or an umpire, appear more plainly than
in this cafe. Had there been a conftituticw in
France, and had that constitution provided,
as it ought to have done, a third party, whose in
terest and duty it ihould have been to do jultice
to the other two, and every individual of each,
there would have been little danger to the peace,
liberty or happinefsof the people : for such an
intermediate authority, by doing justice to all
lides, would have been joined and supported by
the honest and virtuous of all fides, and by this
means would have controuled both parties by the
laws. But in this instance it seemed impoflible
to form a third party. Agitation and terror
reigned every where. It was dreaded every mo
ment that the friends of the King of Navarre,and
those of the Guises would come to blows. All
their measures and devices tended mutually to
destroy each other. Nature itfelf, however,
â¦"ithout much aid from any conftitution,produced
an effedl. Although this unbridled ardor of rul
ing, inflamed as it was by private animosities,
hindered not the two parties from rendering pub
lickly their obedience to the King, this submissi
on had no other principle than a jealousy and mu
tual apprehension, that the one party would
snatch fromthe other the firlt place in thegovern
ment. This motive only, and not any refpedt
for a constitution, had made both parties eager
to appear to be the firft to do homage to Charles
the IXth : and on the day of the death of his
brother, he was unaniinoufly recognized as law
ful sovereign. This step tended insensibly to re
eftablilh order and authority. The Queen-mo
ther saw that it would not be fafe to trust the
life of her young children, nor the administrati
on of the state, to either of the parties, one of
which was extremely irritated and embittered,
and the other full of aflurance and haughty prc
tenfions, both well supported and ready to pro
ceed to the last extremities. She desired to con
tinue mistress of her children, and of the govern
ment of the state : She proposed, to this end, to
remain as a mediatrix ; and thought that the two
parties, unable to agree among themselves, and
neither being unable to triumph over the other,
they would both unite in her favor, and aban
don to her, by concert, an authority which the
opposition ofrheir competitors would hinderthem
from obtaining for '.hemfelves. We fee in this
instance that the tripple balance, is so established
by providence in the constitution of nature, that
01 dei, without it, can never be brought out of
anarchy confufion. The laws therefore
ihould eftablifli this equilibrium, as the dicftateof j
nature aud the ordinance of providence. J

EDUCATION.
Extract from the Charge of the Hon. Chief Justice
Pickering, to the Grand Jwy, at the opening of
the Supreme Judicial Court, at Dover, Sept. 14.
THE reason given by So lo n for not providing
a law against parricides, might be ailigned
for not compelling a free ai>d enlightened peo
ple to keep lchooh, namely, that he thought it
iinpoflible any could be guilty of Co unnatural a
barbarity. One would conceive it equally unne
ceflary to make a law requiring a parent to love
his children; for the fame affecftion, duly regu
lated, would prompt hjm to provide for their
inftrudtion ; this is a duty every parent owes to
his offspringâevery citizen to his country âand
every man to his God. If a child fliould be
brought up without a common education, it is
more than probable he must drudge through life,
become a servant to allâthe dupe and sport
ofthe crafty and designing." Though knowledge
alone, may better the head more than the heart,
yet, without it, the lieart'cannot be good. An
early and good education is the molt probable
mean to preserve a child from the devious paths
of vice, and lead him in those of re&itudeâ
" Train up a child in the way he fliould go,
and when he is old he will not depart from it."
Having glanced at the natural and moral con
sequences of this cruel negletft, let us for a mo
ment advert to the political. If knowledge and
learning, generally difftifed through a commu
nity, be eflential to the preservation of a free go
vernment, then the want of these, must inevi
tably prove its deftriiiftion. Where ignorance
prevails, tyranny triumphs; for the truth of
which we have the concurrent testimony of an
cient and modern history, confirmed by our own
observation. Can we then neglecft the education
of the rising generation, the hope of our land,
when their and our all, so greatly depends up
on it ? Let us rouse from our fupinenefs, and
emulate each other in promoting the means, and
cherishing the interest of literature ! Did Ame
rica everneed men of learning and knowledge
more than at the present juncture ! Or will the
period shortly arrive, when she will no longer
want such characters to fill the various depart
ments in the national or state government ?
MORAL SENTIMENTS.
VIRTUE is not the JoU qualification, but is a primary qualifi
cation for a good ruler. It is necellary in regard to the pre
sent adnitnillration of government : and it is no less neceirary in
regard to the virtue and happiness of the rising generation. If
we aid and encourage the promotion of a vicious citizen, what
ever talcnu he may pofTcfs, we are guilty of a kind of tieafon a
gainst the State, by committing it into hands, in which it cannot
fafely be trusted ; and we hasten corruption and ruin on those
who are to succeed us, by putting a kind of fanftion on vice and
holding up honor as its motive. As long is a free people bestow
honor with discretion, their government will be upholden in
righteousness, they will be faft-and happy under it, and their chil
dren will receive it pure from their hands. But if their elections
should become corrupt, and their appointments should be made
without regard to virtuous merit, they may fee their freedom ho
vering to depart : she breathes only in a puie atmosphere : a con
taminated air soon expels her. A corrupt and degenerate people
are unworthy of her smiles ; and they will not long enjoy them
IF I were to advise a young mm how he might rife to hon
or, one of my firft lcflTons would be, cultivate a modest
oimnionof yourself. There is not a more despicable charac
ter than an arrogant conceited youth. If you aflTume airs of felt
importance, you may be aflured of univerlal contempt. If in all
companies you engrofsthe conversation, obtrude your own opin

how solidly you once confuted such a man, and how wittilv you
answered another, you uiay be pleafcd with the display as your
talents ; but you will pass with others only for an impertinent
coxcomb. I have heard it remarked of Doaor Franklin, that in
conversation he foldom appeared confident of his Own opinion,
or directly contradi&ed the opinion of any in the company. He
fuggeftcd his sentiments by way of enquiry ; and while he was
capable ot inftrufting, seemed to fuppofc all better informed than
htmlelf. He communicated his thoughts without apparent de
sign. He seemed to aim at his own inlormation.

' 1 a ' ar S e . ,ea " cu P full of linseed, two penny worth of
Â± It ck liquorice, and a quarter of a pound of fun raisins Put
these into two quarts of foft water, and let it simmer over a flow
fire till u is reduced to one ; then add to it a quarter of a pound
ot brown fugar-eandy powder, a table fpoonful of old rum, and
a table Ipoon full of the best white wine vinegar or lemon juice
Note. The rum and vinegar are best to be added only to the
quantity you are going immediately to take ; for, if it is put into
the whole, it is apt in a little time to grow flat.
Drink half a pint at going to bed, and take a little when the
cough is troublcfome.
This recipe generally cures the word of colds in two or three
days, and if taken in time may be said to be almost an infallible
remedy. It is a moil sovereign and balfamlc cordial for the
jungs, without the opening qualities which endanger frelh colds
ingoingout. It has been known to cure colds that have been al
molf lcttled in consumptions in less than three weeks.

" By thisopportunity, I have thought well to forward a dii
patch for the President of the United States, committed to mv
care, and which I request you to forward. I trail it convsys aÂ«
alTurance of peace towards you with the new Emperor of Moroc
co. Spain is the only nation wilh whom he has hitherto (hewn
any disposition to quarrel. He has demanded Ceuta, which has
been refufed him, and he is making preparations for bcfieging the
garrison ; an undertaking I am fatisfied he is by no means equal
to. An Amballador from Spain has been lying in Tangier iiay
these 16 days, with a very great present for the Emperor, but will
not land until he (hall agree to give up all prctcnlions to Ceuta,
which he has not yet done.
" The Portuguese squadron continues to be flationed here du
ring the summer months, for the purpose of preventing the Al
gerines from palling to the Westward, which we have reason to
believe they do effeflually. I continue firmlv of opinion that
you have but very little chancc of malting peace with Algiers,
during the present Dey's life. His death may, according to the
courle of nature be daily c<pe&ed. Inclosed I fend you a lift of

wire, to preserve the glass from injuries by hail and flights of
birds in the night. 5
The rafters of the lanthorn are to be well fattened to an iron
