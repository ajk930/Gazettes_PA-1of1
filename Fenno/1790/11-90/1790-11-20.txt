Utiumque regcm, fua mulcitudo conlalutaverat,
THE Queen informed of this union, thought
hejfelf deprived of herfirmeft fuuport, and
dreaded, that the Princes of Lorrain, fupporred
by the credit of the Constable, and difcoutented
with her, might attempt to take from her the re
gency. She thought it necefl'ary therefore, to
connecft herfelf more ftricftly with the King of
Navarre, to counter balance this new party. She
directed all her cares to maintain that equilibri
um, which affined her power and that of her foil.
She entered into all the views of the King of Na
varre, in favor of the Hugonots. Under the pre
text of maintaining peace (luring the minority
of the King, and of conciliating the hearts of the
people, by a reputation of clemency, (he publish
ed new declarations, which enjoined upon all
the parliaments and all the other magistrates of
each province, to molest 110 man on account of
religion ; toreftore the goods, lioufes and poflef
fionsto all thole, who, in times pafled, had been
deprived of them, on suspicion of Heresy. The
parliament of Paris, and some other magistrates
refufed to comply : but the Hugonots, thinking
themselves authorized by the will and orders of
the King, ofthe regent, and the difpolitions of
the council,aflumed to themselves, as they had a
better right to do from God and nature, a liberty
of conscience, and their numbers and forces aug
mented from day to day. This was to fulfil the
views of the Queen, if these religionists had
known how to restrain themselves, within the
bounds of moderation and reason. But as it
commonly happens to people, who fuffer them
selves to be transported by their paflions, and
will not conform to the restraints of authority :
asfoon as they fdt themselves tolerated, protect
ed, and delivered from the fear of puniftimenr,
their resentments of former ill usage arose, they
loft the relpeft due to the magiltrates, and some
times by public aflemblies, and sometimes by in
jurious discourses, or other violent proceedings,
they drew upon themselves the hatred and indig
nation of the Catholicks. Hence arose obstinate
disputes, which throwing the two parties into
quarrels, spread tumult and infurrecftions thro
all the provinces of the kingdom. Thus, con
trary to the intentions of government, and the
expectations of rhe public, the remedy employed
to save the state and maintain peace, became, at
least as our Historian rcprefenK, contagious and
prejudicial: and occasioned precisely those trou
bles and dangers, Which they fought so carcfully
to prevent.
The Guises, we may be sure were not at all
mortified at this turn of affairs. It was precisely
what they wiflied. Encouraged; and fortified by
their union with the Constable, they seized this
occasion to oppose the Queen and the King of
Navarre. The Cardinal of Lorrain, finding the
moment favorable to explain himfelf in council,
without regard to the Queen or the King of Na
varre, who were present : began to speak on the
state of religion, and to represent, with all the
vehemence of his character, that it was to betray
religion, and to dilhonor themselves in the eyes
of the whole earth, to grant, in a most christian
kingdom, liberty of conscience, to innovators al
ready condemned by councils and the voice of
the church. That not fatisfied with difleminat
ing monstrous opinions, with corrupting the ris
ing generation, and imposing on the simplicity
ofthe weak, they blew up the fire of rebellion in
all the provinces of the kingdom. That already
the insolence and outrages of these Heretics, hin
dered the niinifters of the church from celebrat
ing mass, and from appearing in their pulpits,
and left to the magistrates scarce afhadow of au
thority ; thatevery thing was aprey to the sword
and flames, by the imprudence and obstinacy of
those who arrogated to themselves the licence of
believing and teaching at their pleafute ; that
the firft kingdom of Christendom was upon the
point of making a fchifin, of fhakingofFthe yoke
of obedience due to the holy fee, and of aban
doning the Catholic faith, to fatisfy the caprice
of an handful of seditious men. The Cardinal,
enforced these arguments with so much energy,
with that confidence and natural eloquence which
wave liim such an ascendancy, even in the most
problematical opinions, that the protectors of
the Hugonots opposed nothing to him but silence.
The Kingof Navarre and the Queen replied not
Saturday, November 20, 1790.
1 a word, and even the Chancellor appeared amaz
ed and confounded. The counsellors of Itate,
irritated againlt the Hugonots, were of opinion
to aflemble immediately all the Princes and of
ficers of the crown, to the parliament of Paris,
there to treat on this fubjetii, in the presence of
the King, and determine the means of curing
these dilbrders. This aflembly was accordingly
held on the 13th of July, 1561, in parliament.
The King of Navarre dared not alone to make
opposition openly ; this would have been to de
clare himfelf a Calvinift. The Queen indeed, de
sired that the Catholic party Ihould not prevail ;
but she was not the less apprehensive that they
would impute to her the establishment and pro
gress of Heresy. The Cornells in parliament
were however, animated: the partizans of the
Hugonots, forgot motliing to procure them liber
ty of conscience, as the only means proper to ap
pease all troubles, and heal all divisions. Their
efforts were useless. There was some reason for
faying, that liberty of conscience was evidently
opposed to the spirit and authority of the Catho
lic church ; but none at all for pretending that
it was contrary to the fundamental laws of the
kingdom.
It was decided that the Calviniftical preachers
and ministers should fee chafed out ot the king
dom : and that they fliould conform in the pub
lic worship, only to the customs and ceremonies
Authorized by the Roman church. All aflemblies,
of every kind and in everyplace, with arms or
without, except in the Catholic churches, there
to hear divine service, according to their usages,
were forbidden. To grant, however, some miti
gation to the Hugonots, they added in the fame
Edict, that the cognizance of the crime of Here
sy, should be reserved to Bilhops and their grand
Vicars: and if they had recourse to the secular
arm, they could not condemn the guilty, but to
banifament : finally, they gave a general amnes
ty for all disorders committed in times pafled, on
account of religion. A declaration was drawn,
signed by the King, the Queen, and all the Princ
es and lords of parties. (To be continued.)

Of MODERN CORRUPTIONS in the ENGLISH
PRONUNCIATION.
(CONTINUED.)
BUT it will be replied, Custom is the legijlator 0/ language, and
custom authorizes the practice I am reprobating. A man
can hardly offer a reason, drawn from the principles of analogy
and harmony in a language, but he is instantly lilenced with the
dccifive, jus et norma loquendi *
What then is Custom ? Some writer has already answered this
question ; Custom is the plague of wife men and tne idol of
lools." This was probably said of those quftoms and falhions
which are capricious and varying ; for there are many cuiloms,
founded on propriety, which are perman' nt and conftitu'e laws.
But what kind of custom did Horace delien to lay down as the
standard of speaking ? Was it a local cuft'iin ? Then the neoio of
New-England ; the oncet and twicet of Penniylvania and Mary
land ; and the keind and Jkey of the London theatres, form rules
of speaking. Is it the practice of a court, or a few eminent schol
ars and orators, that he designed to conftitulc a standard ? But
who ffiall determine what body of men forms this uncontrolahle
legiflaturc ? Or who fball reconcile the differences at court ? For
these eminent orators often disagree. There arc numbers of words
in which the moll eminent men differ: Can all be right ? Or
what, in this cafe, is thccuflom which is to be our guide ?
Befidestjiefe difficulties, what right have a few men, however
elevated their station, to change a national pra&ice ? They may
fay, that they consult their own ears, and endeavor to pleale" them
selves. This is their only apology, unless they can prove that
the changes they make are real improvements. But what im
provement is there in changing the founds of three or four letters
into others, and thus multiplying anomalies, and encreaGng the
difficulty of learning a language ? Will not the great body of the
people claim the privilege of adhering to their ancient usages, and
believing their prafticeto be most correct ? They most undoubt
edly will.
If Horace's maxim is ever just, it is only when custom is na
tional ; when the practice of a nation is uniform or general. In
this cafe it becomes the common law of the land, and no one will
dispute its propriety. But has any man a right to deviate from
this pra&ice, and attempt to eftablifb a fingutar mode of his own 2
Have two or three eminent stage players authority to make chang
es at pleafurc, and palm their novelties upon a nation under the
idea of custom? The reader will pardon me for tranferibing here
the opinion of the celebrated Michaelis, one of the most learned
philologers of the present century. "It is not," favs he, " lor a
scholar (o give laws nor prolcribe established expressions : If he
takes so much on himfelf he is ridiculed, and deftrvedlv; it is no
more than a just martificatior. to his ambition, and the penally of
his usurping on the rights of the people. Language is a demo
cratical state, where all the learning in the world docs not war
rant a citizen to supersede a received custom, till he convinced
the whole nation that this custom is a miftike. Scholars are not
so infallible that every thing is to be referred to them. Were
they allowed a dectfory power, the errors of language, I am sure,
instead of diminishing, would be continually increasing. Learned
heads teem with them no ltfs than the vulgar; and thj former
are much more imperious, that we (hould be compelled to defer
to their innovations and implicitly to receive every falfe opinian
1 of theirs."f

GUAGE
[Whole No. 165.]
Yrc this right is often assumed by individuals, who dittate to a
nation the rules of Ipeaking, with the fame impcrioulnefs as a ty
rant gives laws to his vaiTals : And, flrange as it may appear, cveu
well bred people and scholars, often surrender their right of pri
vate judgment to these literary governors. The ipfc dixit of u
JohnJon, a Garrick, or a Sheridan, has the force of law ; and to
contraditt it, is rebellion. A(k the moll of our learned men, how
they would pronouncc a word or compose a sentence, and thev
will immediately appeal to some favorite author whose decifiort
is final. Thus distinguished eminence in a writer often becomes
a pafTportfor innumerable errors.
The whole evil originates in a fallacy. It is often supposed
that certain great men are infallible, or that their pradtice confli-
I tutes custom and the rule of propriety. But on the contrary, any
man, however learned, is liable to mistake ; the most learned,
as Michaelis obferves,often teem with errors, and not unfrecpiently
become attached to particular fyflems, and imperious in forcing
them upon the world.| It is not the particular whim of such
men, that constitutes cujlom ; but the common pra&ice of a nation,
which is conformed to their general ideas of propriety. The pro
nunciation of keoiVj keind, drap, juty, natjhur, &c. are neither
right nor wrong, because they are approved or cenfurcd by par
ticular men ; nor because one is local in New-England, another
in the middle States, and the others are supported by Â»he couit
and stage in London. They are wrong, because they are opposed
to national prattice ; they are wrong, because they are arbitrary
or careless changes of the true founds of our letters ; they are
wrong, because they break in upon the regular conftruÂ£lion of
the language ; they are wrong, because they render the pronunci
ation difficult both for natives and foreigners ; they are wrong,
because they make an invidious diftinÂ£lion between the polite and
common pronunciation, or else oblige a nation to change their ge
neral cultoins, without presenting to their view one national ad
vantage. These arc important, they are permanentconfiderations;
they are superior to the caprices of courts and theatres ; they are
ieafons that are interwoven in the very ftru&ure of the language,
or founded on the common law of the nation ; and they are a liv
ing satire upon the licent : oufnefs of modern fpcakers, who dare to
flight their authority.
But let us examine whether the pra&ice I am censuring is ge
neral or not; for if not, it cannot come within Horace's rule. If
we may believe well informed gentlemen, it is not general even
in Great-Britain. I have been personally informed, and by gen
tlemen of education and abilities, one of whom was particular
in his observation, that it is not general, even among the most
eminent literary charatters in London. It is less frequent in the
interior counties, where the inhabitants still speak as the common
people do in this country. And Kenikk fpcaks of it as an atTc6f
ation in the metropolis which ought to be difcounienanced,

LITERATURE
FLOURISHES in the United States. As one
instance we mention the patronage given to the
American press. Thenew publications multiply
fact. Besides original productions, many tranl
atliintic works have been reprinted. The Bible
in 121110. has lately been published in Philadel
phia by Mr. Youngâin which city, and in New-
York, two or three other editions of this valuable
book, are now in|the pressâand Mr. Thomasâ
(whom an ingenious southern writer has called
the American Bafkcrville, and from whose press
have iflued many large and valuable books) âis
now engaged in printing two editions of the Bible ;
one the large Royal Quarto BIBLE ; the other a
large Folio, with 50 copperplatesâA patriotic,
laudable and heavy undertaking, deserving the
patronage and encouragement of every friend to
his country, the sciences, and religion. Mr.
Dobson, of Philadelphia, is also publishing an
" American Edition of the ENCYCLOPEDIA or
Ditfionary of Arts, Sciences, and Miscella
neous Literature."âTwo volumes of this
work are already finifhedâ it will comprise 16
volumes. (Columbian Centintl.)

Po? EADDRESS
To his Excellency Governor PATEJISOX.
S I R,
AMIDST the numerous addrefles which have been presented
since your laic appointment, the Bar of New-Jersey beg leave
to solicit your attention. As" friends and as brothers we address
you; and if, in this testimonial of refpettand veneration tor your
chara&er, we should depart from the usual stile of congratulation,
we hope the feelings which occasion the departure, will plead our
apology. The profeflion 111 which we labour is of lo dclicate a
nature, that to preserve the chara&erof a gentleman with tellow
pra&itioners and deserve the noble appellation of an honed man
with the reft of mankind, requires a propriety of condutt which
can be claimed by few, but which ought to be aimed at by all.
Perhaps no man ever pra6lifed at the bar, who so fully arrived ai
this desirable point as yourfelf ; and whilst you afford an eminent
example of moral rectitude and enlightened understanding, you re
pel the illiberal idea that ftiicl virtue is incompatible with the
practice of the forum. Since the interest of the state calls the ex
crcife oJ your abilities from the bar, we look forward with plea
lure to that equal diftributicm of justice, which mull be the conse
quence of your judgment and experience, when you preside as
chancellor, of the state. In this point of view, fir, you are not loft
to the profeflion ; and as citizens, we enjoy the profpefl ot every
benefit which can result from an efficient and guarded administra
tion. As no one can better uuderftand the interest? of the com
munity, your own benevolence and the general affe&ion for your
person, will conspire to accomplilh oui political harmony, which
will at once give us weight in the national government, and influ
ence the prosperity of the union. That your constant and fuccefs
ful exertions in your late public character, should meet with the
utmost gratitude this state could display, ought to have been ex
pc&edâbut very few official appointments have, like your own,
combined all ranks of people in one common bond of affection.
Under vour auspices, fir, we are become a band of brothers ;
every whifperof suspicion will be baqifhed : and whilst we, as a
pi oleftion, bid adieu to your Excellency, as the most diltinguifh
ed member of it, wc, at the fame time, embrace you as the ruler
of a free enlightened people. That the cares of office may set
lightly on your brow, is <Â»ur fmcereft wiftiâBe firm ! âlor Hea
ven smiles on conscious re&itude : And long may you live to go
vern our interests and our hearts.
At the reque/l and in behalf of the Bar of New-J erfev
JOSEPH BLOOMFIELD, Attorney-General
November 13, 1790.
GENTLEMEN,
YOUR address affects mc in a most sensible manner : It flows
from the heart : It comes from friends and from brothers :
âI receive it as such ; and asfuch, I feel it. The testimonial you
present in favor of my private profeflion and public character, is
exprelTcd in the most obliging terms. In return, be plea fed to
accept the warm efFufions of a grateful heart : To live in your al
feÂ£tion and esteem is qiy fervent wish, and (tall be my continual
itudv. To etfeft this desirable end, my cares and efforts {hall be
directed to promote the freedom and happiness of the good peo
ple of this ftatr, to advance our national prosperity ; and to those
numerous and diverfified objects, which result from the admini
stration of a free government, it is the full purpose of my foul to
aÂ£t with firmnefs, uniformity and iec-ifion ; to make general prin
ciples, and not expedients, the constitution and law
of the land, and not the politics of the moment, the rule of my
conduct. While thus I ast, conscious re&itude will smooth the
brow of carc, and adminiftcr consolation and lupport in the most
difficult and trying (late of things.
Candor, liberality of sentiment, and moral re&itude, have, I
well know, been always held in high estimation by the advocates
of this state : These, indeed, are virtues ufeful and ornamental in
every profeflion, and in none more so than that of the law : May
they ever decorate the Bar of New-Jersey ! The profefTors of the
law, have diflinguifhed themselves in behalf of the violated rights
of mankind; have been eminently ufeful in the late revolution,
and in the formation and eftablifhcd of our national government.
In this point of view, they are dear to eveiy friend of freedom ;
and it is not without a degree of profeilional pride, that I behold
that long lift of juridical names, which illumine and adorn the pa
triot roll of America.
In the administration of public affairs, it is a pleating and ani
mating circumstance, that in every measure which will conduce
to the general interell of the state, or of the union at large, the ex
ecutive can confidently rely upon the aid and cordial co-operation
of the gentlemen of the law. But notwithftandiag these encou
raging afTuranccs, it is not without much diffidence and anxiety,
that I enter upon the execution of the important trust committed
to my care. The scene is newâthe task is arduous. Alas !â
gentlemenâl fearâthat I shall often regret my acceptance of the
honorable officejwhich I now occupyâand wifliâthat I had con
tinued with you a fellow-prattitioner at the Bar. There I form
ed my friendfhipsâthere I pasTed the prime ot my life, and ex
pcÂ£ted to pass the evening of my days : Thereâl have often seen
and experienced your candour and politenessâyour generosity of
i'eutiment and elevation ot foul. Memory will frequently
to my view those social hours, in which we lived as brothers, and
in which we mingled the " feaft of reaion and the flow of foul
âhours, which I shall muse upon with pleasing melancholy ! and
fwceteft luxury of thought !
Go, geinlemen, and be happyâ 30. and flill continue to exer
cise those virtues and talents, the display of which has rendered you
conspicuous, and merited the esteem and confidence of vour fellow
citizens :âgo, and may you long live an ornament to'the profef
fion in which you labour, ana a blefling to the society in which
you live. WILLIAM PATERSOX.

IN the year I 762, when success attended the Bri
tifli arms in exery quarter of tine globe, this
country derived near ten millions sterling of spe
cie from the different captures made by the fleet
and army. Such an influx of wealth, invigorated
commerce and encouraged indultry, while it rai
led the fpiric of the nation to a pitch of enthufi
afin, that rendered our men invincible again ft

to abide longer with us, or bid adieu to acountiy
which, from long residence, and habit of jntima

The lall letters from Spain contradict the ac
counts of the emperor of Morocco's aflaffination
âthough his cruelties and caprices every day
fubjeift hi in to such an accident. He is, however,
represented as a warm friend (if such a man can
be called a friend) to the Englifli, whose cause he
espouses upon every occasion.
Considerable quantities of Amercan pot-ashes
having been condemned by the Aflaymalters,peo
ple Ikilled in that manufacture, have been led to
make several experiments to discover the causes
of its defe&s and impurity. The great evil
which injures the sale, and very much reduces
the value of some of the American pot-ash, ari
ses from foreign matters, such as common fait
and earth, being accidentally or* designedly mix
ed with it. People vending or dealing in this
article may save thenifelves the trouble and dis
grace of fending an adulterated or faulty kind to
market, if they will only Iprevioufly observe the
following method for trying its quality.âTake
some pot-ash and diflolve it in water : Let there
be as much pot-alh as the water will diflolve.
Then plunge a piece of fifver coin, or any thin
plate of silver into the solution. If the pot-alh
contains any inflammable or improper mixtures,
it will change the silver to a dark or black colour,
in the fame manner as if it had been over the
lteani of burning sulphurâis the pot-ash is pure
tiie silver will remain bright.âUpon the experi
ment being made ihould it be discovered to be
bad, the evil can be remedied only by diflolving
the whole quantity in pure water, and boiling it
down, and fluxing it a second time ; or it may
be made into pearl-sflies, by calcination, with
little expence.
An eminent physician, whose name we are not
at liberty to mention, has obliged us with a lift
of Epidemic disorders now raging in England :
among|which are the following.âSore Throat.
âThis, he observes, although apparently infec
tious is peculiar only to certain inhabitants of the
street called Old-Baily, and frequently proves fa
tal to fix or eight at a time, âN. B. It never af
fects the patient but once, and always ends in
fuffocation. Oflate,phyficians have recommend
ed long sea voyages, to persons so bad as to be
in danger of this difteinperâbut it is always bet
ter to prevent than to cureâand very ufeful di
rections for prevention may be found by applying
to the Philanthropic Society, or the Sunday schools.
Gaming is a fever, or teveiifhed affection of
the chronickindâvery rarely proving/&</Â« fatal
but if the patient has once caught. it, seldom
leaves him, Ihould he live ever so lono-. The
paroxysms of the distemper resemble thofeof the
ague, that is, are cold and hot fitsâthe discharge
of yellow matter, leaves the patient very low, and
frequently a delirium conies 011, ending in sud
den death. In some patients he has observed a
11 Umbei of black and red spots, which he considers
as very unfavourable symptoms.âThe disorder
is not hereditary, nor communicable without
coming in contacftwith those black and red spots.
It has been known to leave the patient for seve
ral years, and afterwards return. When this is
the cafe, lie observes that it is always fatal, a
mortification enfu'tng. In younger patients av'lor

Extract of a letter from Briflol, Sep*.
" The famous Herfchell is about to publifli
some new oblervations upon the planetary lyftem.
\\ ith respect to those already made on the moon,
if his glalles have not inifled him, the deductions
will give us a good deal of insight into the real
nature of that planet.âFrom the information
o. his teleicope, several burningmountains, com
monly called Volcanoes, do there exist ; and if
such an element as fire does there exist ; there
muit be certainly such a fluid as air ro support it;
and from hence we may count upon the reality
of an atmosphere, about our attendant Satellite.
By a peculiar lucid whiteness always plainly diftinguilhable at one or the other of the lunar poles
lie also proves, that like the poles of the earth,
they are alternately covered with snow and ice.
Mr. Herfchell is now waiting anxiously for a to
tal lunar eclipse, in hopes ic will afford him an
opportunity of making some new discoveries, to
improve the planetary knowledge of the eigh
teenth century. Miss Herfchel, lifter to the As
tronomer, has lately written a second letter to the
lioval lociety, on aitronomical fubje<sts, which is
much read and approved of. We have, indeed,
sio woman upon record in this orany other coun
try, who has applied tubes withfuch success, t6
the planetary system, as this Lady."

" Under the eye of Mr. Htrfchel, the Universe
eilcreales upon us. He has recently enumerated
forty-jour thoufar.d flars in the space of a tew de
grees ; and, by analogy, there appears to be no
less than feventy-five millions in the visible heavens.
If they fill infinite space, their number mull of
consequence be infinite also. No part of mathe
matical science is more apt to surprize the gener
ality of mankind than the measurement of the re
lative positions and distances of inncceffible objects.
To determine the distance of a Ihip seen on a re
mote pare of the unvaried furface of the oceanâ
toafcertain the height of the clouds and meteors
which float in the atmosphere, and to (hew with
certainty, the wonderful dimensions and distan
ces of the fun and other bodies, apparently glid
ing on the fame visible canopy, are among those
problems, which, to the unletter'd, seem beyond
the reach of human art âthey are, nevertheless,
truly resolved, by means of inftrumentsconftruc't
edou mathematical principles."
from the prodigious number of Europeans, as
well as not a few American veflels that have long
been in the habit of frequenting the northern
polar seas for the fake of taking whales and other
fish for the production of oil, those animals have
of iate years become comparatively scarce. The
demand for oil, which is indispensable, has now
put many of the adventurous owners of Ihips in
the four eastern states, upon fending their veflels
to the southern extremity of the globe for this
purpofc, where, especially from the fiftieth to the
fixtietli degrees of latitude, whales are from ex
perience known to besides (on the(hores)
/eals, sea lions, and other aquatic animals, that
are capable of yielding this article in a propor
tionate abundance. Several veflels have failed
from the ports of the eastern states, since the be
ginning of Augufton this voyage, molt of which
are expedted to return the latter end of next
summer, or the beginning of autumn.
Monsizu r. Voi ney, the great traveller, and whofc voyage to
the Holy Land and othcr(partsof Asia, has given the world (o much
pleasure in its perusal, is now a member of the I'rcnch National
Ad'embly. Remarkable was his sentiment, when in giving his
opinion on thetgreat question of granting a complete liberty to the
Press in France, under the renovated government, he observed as
follows :â" As in ships (said he) inhabited by a great number of
people where thcie is a constant and fatal tendency to putrefa&i
on, it bccomes absolutely necessary (in order to preserve health)
to fumigate, scrape, sprinkle with vinegar,and convey a conltant
supply of frefh air by every means possible into the interior parts
between and'below the decks ; in like manner in every govern
ment, even the mod free, there is afimilar ftroug tendency of those
at) office towards despotism and tyranny. The libei ty of the press,
is in this cafe the great ventilator, the salutary vinegar, the busy
scraping iron, and th? searching fumigatorâit is this that will in
iutuie preserve our political health in particular ; and I will be
bold to fay, that in any kingdom even the mod extensive, wheie
the people can read and write, and there is a press absolutely and
and sacredly freeâthere the monfterof tyranny cannot enterâthe
poisonous fcrpent will not be able to breatheâshe mud either
sicken and die, or depart into those realms and regions whose at
jnofphere is more congeuial to her own nature.'*

By the returns of the MILITIA of the slate of
Connecticut, there appearsto be fix brigades, thir
teen Regiments of Infantry, fix of Cavalry, three
companies of Matrofles, and three companies of
State Guards, amounting in the whole to thirty
thoufand effective men, well officered and appoint
ed, and completely armed ; nioft of the regi
ments were reviewed last month, and arc gene
rally in a neat uniform. A degree of emulation
pervades officers and privates to excel in the mi
litary art, that does honor to them as freemen,
and as citizens of a republic, who are determined
io support the conftitntion and government of
the country, without the aid of a Handing army,
or an expensive national militia. It is hoped the
example will extend to the neighbouring llates,
mid through the union, that foreign nations may
have 110 inducement ro attack us, when they find
ws constantly prepaTe4 for war.
The loan which has lately been negociated in
Holland with lb much.facility and dispatch,âthe
frequent and ref'pedtful mention which is now
made of this country in foreign printsâthe anx
iety which has been (hewn by the Englilh left the
United States should take part with the Spani
ards, in cale a war should break out between the
two powers, and the desire which England ex
prefles to conclude a treaty with us, mark the
change in the sentiments of foreign
nations with regard to us, in the strongest manner.
(General Advertijer.)
A correspondent oblerves, that the emigration
of trench citizens to this country, at this period,
is an event ofa very Angular nature : Atthe mo
ment when the people of France are emerging
from the depths of defpoiil'm, and are averting
their claim to those rights and privileges which
confer real dignity on the human character, a
very considerable number of their fellow citizens
are Seeking an asylum in the wilds of America.
This is the apparent state of the cafe: Buta few
reflections may serve to place it in a different
point of view. These emigrants have discover
ed by their conduct, that they entertain just and
competent ideas of liberty, by electing this land
of freedom as thfir retreat: Here a government
is already eltablifhed, which secures the proper
ty and equal rights of all : They reason on firm
principles, when they aflociate the idea of a bal
lanced government, liketliat ofthe UnitedStaies,
with that of civil liberty ; for life, liberty and
property, are certainly afloat where a despotic
majority bears all before it.
How long this may continue to be the cafe in
France, appeared to these emigrants uncertainâ
tor power is intoxicatingâand the majority there
have certainly made the niott unbounded use of
theirs, b) poflefling themlelves at a stroke, of the
greatest amount of wealth that ever was confifca
ted to the use of the public. The conafcation of
clie property of the clergyâand the voluntary
contributien of a great proportion of the estates
of individuals to public nfes, may be neceflaryâ
but are doubtlels considered as very alarming
precedentsâfor plausible pretexts are never
wanted by uncontrolled power, to make indis
criminate appropriations for the public goodâ
110 man, or body of menâno profeflion is exempt
âand so long as power can be supported by coii
fifcations, the profped: of a conltitution, which
ilia 11 check the rapacity of the majority, is an il
lusive idea. How far these emigrants are to blame
for quitting the pleasant fields of France, when
the exigencies of their country called for the a
bilitiesand patriotic exertions of all good citizens,
is problematical. Had they feel) a fair prospect
of fettled times, under the auspices of a free go
vernment, it is hardly to be supposed they would
have encountered the perils of the sea, and the
hardlhips of the wilderness, that they might pass
the residue of life in peace, security and freedom.
From hence we may infer, that emigration from
France at this cifis, is an imperfetfl comment on
the French revolution.

Philadelphia sincerely sympathizes with the

conduct in private and public life, has long ex
cited the love of his friends, and the admiration
of the molt distant States. His firmnefs cruflied
the rebellion in Maflachufetts in 1787. He pre
fered character to popularity, and the elteem of
wife and good men, to the praise and flattery of
the ignorant and unthinking multitude. Some
men have opposed a iingle tyrant with boldness,
who have afterwards basely crouched to the sol
ly and tyranny of the people ; but Gov. Bowdoin
poflefled the lingular fortitude of opposing a whole
body of hisconftituents when they were acling un
der a fit of temporary madness. May such Go
vernors be immortal in the annals of America !â

AS the ladies in general are more affe&ed by the prevalence of

which are so frequently fatal to their own tranquility.
l.ouis the XlVth was it.led the o R eatâ with how much justice
will appear from the following txtraÂ£l of a letter, written to luni
by the excellent feneton.
" Your people whom you ought love as your children, and
who have hitherto fell so strong an dffettion for you, are dying of
hunger. The cultivation of the country is almost wholly aban
doned ; the towns and villages are depopulated ; every species of
trade is decaycd,and no longer supports those who work in it j com
merce is annihilated.â.You have consequently deflroyed one hait
the real internal flrength of your kingdom, to gain and maintain
litllecontjuefts abroad. Instead of draining money from the im
poverilhed people, it was necelfary to give them alms and food.
The whole kingdom of Fiance is become a great hospital, deso
late and without provisions. The inagiflrates arc degraded, and
the nobility, againfl whom judgements have been obtained, live
only by protections. You are importuned by crouds who de
mand and who murmur.âlt is you, yourfelf, Sire, who have cre
ated all these embarrafTinents ; for the whole kingdom being iu
ined, you haveevery thing in your own hands, and none can live
but by your benefactions. Such, Sire, is this great kingdom, such
is its prosperity, under a King who is every day piinted as the de
light of his people, and who would be so in reality, if the counsels
of fychophants had not poifoncd him."
Rome once mistress of the world, owed her origin to a band of

And are not the justly tamed Americans their lineal descendants ?
The philosopher, when he contemplates human nature as liable to
degenerate to a level with the brute, may, by turning the picture
again, beaold it emerging from its debasement, and, riftng on the

By virtue and indullry the United States hold their claim to

That our citizens should be brought up in habits of virtue and

BY THE MAIL ARRIVED LAST EVENING.
ABSTRACT OF FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE.
PHILADELPHIA, Nov. 20.
A Gentleman, who arrived in townyejleriay from
Alexandria, informs ; That a vejfel had arrived there
from Dunkirk, and brought accounts to the firjl of
Octoberâwhich jlate, that a full accommodation of all
differences had taken place, between Spain and En
gland.
By recent accounts from Holland we are informed, that owing
to the great decline of the Dutch commerce the agio of the bank,
of Amsterdam has fallen to less than one per cent, above par.
The average ol the agio or advancc on bank, money has com
monly been 3 per. cent. 2nd it has frequently been up to 5 per
cent. The price of silver had also greatly risen, dollars were at
53 stivers ; this extraordinary event is accounted for on different
principles, the general idea is, that it originated in the great de
mand for fpecic to Ihip tothe United States.
There can be no doubt of the Spanish fleets' having re
turned into port the 6th Sept. This account has been corrobora
ted from vaiious quarters; consequently the story of an engage
ment, via Charleifon, (S. C.) falls to the ground.
The very formidable preparations made by Great-Britain,
are evidently designed to prevent a war. Peace is perhaps more
necelTary to that country, thaji to any other in Europe: This is the
opinion of Mr. Pi tt, and ofhet - wisest and best men: Spaia
will therefore deliberate a good while before she attacks a power,
in itfelf more than her match, and prepared at all points for the
worst.
France cannot seriously meditate hostilities : According to the
statements made by her patriots in the National Assembly, her fi
nances are in so critical a situation, that extra expenccs at this en
ds, would involve the nation in bankruptcy.
Catharine,deferred by the Empeior,is looking out for new al
lies ; but the account of her entering into an alliance with Sweden,
in order to support the war against the Porte, is hardly credible, if,
as has been reported, Sweden has been in league with the latter.
âShould it, however, turn out to be fact, that Qie considers Gufta
vus no longer as an enemy, it ftiongly indicates that ihe is tired
of, or io much exhausted by the war, that she is determined to fol
low the example of the Emperor of Germany, and make peace
with the Turks.
It is intercfting to trace the different origins of the commotions
which agitate the various parts of Europe.
In France the revolution was preceded by free thinking, li
bertinism and philofophyâbefore these down topples the whole
hierarchy ; for making a fweepflakes of the property of the cler
gyâthat formidable pillar of despotism is Tapped at its founda
tion.
In Germany, on the other hand, only the gradual attempts
of the late Emperor to reform abuses, has kindled a flame of op
position to what is there confidcred as an outrageous attack on the
dearest rights and privileges of the people.
By a London paper of iÃih Sept. it appears that Peace was
proclaimed at Stockholm, capital of Sweden, the 31ft August.
The late fire at Madrid burnt ten days.
' The Britilh fleet under Lord Hows had arrived at Spithead,
and the general opinion in London was, that there would be peacc
through Europe.
On Saturday the 6th inft. died at Bollon, aged 64, the Hon.
Jam es Bo wdoi n, Esq. late Governor of the State of Massachu
setts ; President of the American Academy of Arts and Scienccs ;
and of the Massachusetts Humane Society ; Fellow of the Royal So
cieties of London and Dublin ; and 0% the Society of Arts in G.
Britain ; and Doctor ot Laws in the Universities of Cambridge
and Edinburgh. \_An account Sf his funeral folemnitiesJhalL ap

.storal ELEGY. From POEMS by John Raknie,
lately publijhed.
YE valleys to which I complain,
Now trac'd with the tear-ftrccming eye,
I know that my sorrows are vain,
Yet love to indulge the fond sigh !
To muse on the days that are flown,
To think dearest Lucy on thefi !
My heart must be cold as thy own,
Ere loft the remembrance can be.
When summer in beauty arfay'd,
Shone here with a fplcndour refined,
In thee all its charms were difplav'd,
In thee all its beauties conjoined.
Thy smile, to its lustre serene,
The glories of Eden reftor'd :
Whose death gave a damp to the scene,
Whose death will be ever doplor'd !
Who rose, the sweet flow'r of delight!
Of Nature's perfe&ion in bloom :
Now loft in the confines of night,
âConceal'd in the shade of the Tomb \
In whom love and friendfhip I found ;
Heart-piercing reflexion to me !
O Lucyâeach object around,
Reminds thy LoÃENzaof thee.
The winter now frowns on the year,
And loudly the hurricanes howl,
How lov'dâtor a semblance they bear,
To thetempefts that rage in toy foul!
All nature isfadden v d to woe,
The songsters no longer arc gay ;
Deje&ed they fit on each bough,
And mourn o'er the season's decay :
But nature again shall rejoice ;
.And Spring all her beauties restore ;
The songsters again raise their voice
In melody sweet as before !
The scene that so gloomy appears,
Again (hall its brightness resume :
Yet I Ihall explore it in tears,
Nor raise my fad hopes from the tomb !
The tomb, over which I recline,
That cruelly keeps thee from view,
Dear Lucy, may shortly be mine 1
That profpett is all I pursue.
The sports of the village I wave ;
No longer endearing to me r
O Lucy my foul's in thy grave,*
My withes all center in thee !
* My heart is in the coffin there, with Ccejar;
And I mujlpaufeâtill it come back again. Shakespear
