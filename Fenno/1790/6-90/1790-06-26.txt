ADDRESS of the NATIONAL ASSEMBLY to the
PEOPLE of FRANCE.
February nth, 1790.
DURING the progrefsof their labors, the Na
tional Afl'embly receives from all quarters
the congratulation of the provinces, cities, and
communities, the teftlmonies of the public joy,
the acclamations of gratitude ; but it likewise
hears the murmurs, the clamors ofthofe who fee)
hurt or affiifted at the measures taken against
iintnberlefs abufes,intei efts and prejudices. While
engaged in providing for the happiness of all, it
concerns itfelf with the misfortunes ofindividuals
âit pardons prejudiceâspite and injulticeâbut
it conliders it as a duty, to guard you against the
influences of calumny, and to deitroy the vain
terrors with which you are attempted to be sur
prised. What measures have not been taken to
mislead youâto snake your confidence ?âSome
pretend to be ignorant, and ask what good has
the National Aflembly done > We will remind
you. Difficulties have been thrown in the way
of what has been done, which we will answer.â
Doubts have been circulated, uneasiness has been
excited refpedting what will be done. \\ c aie

ever. The rights of nun were forgottenâinfill -

favor of humanity, by that declaration which will
forever be the signal to rally against oppreihon,
r.nd the law of the legislators themselves. The
nation had loft the right of decreeing both laws
and impostsâThis right has been restored to itâ
and the trite principles of the Monarchy, the in

the inheritance of the throne in a family, lo dear

(\lr. BOUDINOT's Speech concluded.)
'""INHERE is no connection between my debt agair.ft t!".e prrlon
X who may become my security to another, and the creditor
to whom I owe a debt of my own contractingâStfppofe in coin
mon dealing A. owes B. 100!. but being unable to pay, C
(who owes him money) as his security to B.âBefore the debt is
paid, C thef cuiity becomes insolvent, and A retrieve* his affairs
and is able to payâwould any man think A in his lenfcs, to rc
fufÂ» payme nt to B. because C. was unable to pay the debt due to
him. But it G. had paid the money to B. then thedebt was chang
ed and C. would have a right ro charge it ag3inft the debt he owed
to A. So, whenever the State has discharged a debt by
Congress, tothe indiidnal citizen, and has t'ie evid nee of it in
heftreafury, such Stace has no right to demand a repayment* 'til,
by the fcttiement of her accounts with the United Starts, it (hall
appear.that a balance is due to her. This is every day's practice
between man and man. But both the equity and policy of th ; s
measure have been denied. As to the firft, let it be a iked, are the
fads above set forth true, " that the debt was originally that of the
United S:a:er, an .1 that the creditor has never received any fatis
faCtion for it ?" If so, where is thejufticeor equity of making a
difcrimnation among our creditors ? Can any man assign a real >n,
I why debts of the fame nature, under the fame contract and for
the Gime fcrvices, (hould be n;eÂ£ed and treated as of no force,
merely because they have been fettled and vouched by different of

for the support of hirfamily, at the bayonet fay, when
they are told, that alt r waiting ten years in Vain for tlu.ir jult
it itnaw inequitable to pay their demand, because it was
fettled by tht government, agreeably to the directions of
CongrÂ£is. # There Tliufc be the greatest equity in appropriating that
treasure, supplied b.y the union at large, tothe pa)meuÂ£ of tito/e
debts contracted for their common dcfence. A fait argument I
(hall offer to ihew the equity of this measure is, that we are 111
jaofieflion of the very means from which alone the States could pay
thefedebts, if their obligation to it was ever so clear.
I now coineto the policy of the measureâAs in private life, so
in every government, 1 am fully latisfied, that honcfty will ever
be found to be tTie best policy.
The policy of this meafdrc arises from numberless sources. âIt
isfuppoiting t'be pybliC faith.âAs-our present conduCl {hall be,
so will be the conduCl of others towards us, whenever we shall
need further loans for public lei viceâA tew hundred dollars sa
ved now, may heieafter cost us more thousands âOur condtiCfc on
this occaiion will be narrowly watched, and not forgotten in ma
ny years. â Good policy requires one uniform rule of paying our
public debt, as well as the like uniformity in the arrangment and
collection of the public revenue.âAnother source of the policy of
this measure arises from the propriety of fupprefiing all tempta-
I tions to unneceflary party zeal and collision ot opposite interefls a
-1 mong the citizens of the fame government. Let gmtlemen con
i fider the operation of a contrary mtafurc.âWill the citizcns ot in-
I dividual States fee with complacency the produce of'fo heavy an
1 impofl, expended in partial payments of the debts of the general
government, while their demands, funded in the (In Cleft
are wholly disregarded by those who are bound to do equal justice
to evcrv citizen. It should not be forgotten, that the colleChon of
a revenue in such a country as oqrs, deprndsjgreatly upon opinion.
If, by our public measures, we once make it reputable to defraud
the revenue, it will be out of the power of all your regulations
and penalties to secure its due colleCtiqn. At present there is a u
niveifal prejudice in your favor. The patriotism of your citizens
is a greater fccuVity than your utmost force. They think that the
government is in their own hands.âThat they are truly rcprcfcnt
cd here, and that theii contributions, are faithfully applied to their
best interests. Cherish this spirit, by the mod impartial jufticc
.ind equal dealings to every citizen. -If once it becomes a habit to
depart fiom the path of virtue, it will be more than difficult to
tread back those steps again. It is policy, to prevent by this
means, one State from pre)ing on the neceflities of another, by
which jraloufy, feuds and animosities. so dangerous to every go
vernment, are often promoted. Aliho' I am in general averse
from bringing into view on general questions, the local circum
ftancesof a particular State, yet in the present cafe, I beg leave to
hold up the circumstance of the State from which I have the honor
of coming, because I am best acquainted with her real situation.
It is well known to this committee, that in the beginning of the
war, she was deprived of many of her citizens, who went off to
the enemy. She prcfented her whole sea coafl as a frontier to the
British troops.âShe was invaded every few months, for fcveral
years of the war.âMer militia was almost continually in the field.
âHer towns were clefertedâHer houses were burnedâHer pro
perty plundered, and her faithful citizens carried into captivity.ââ¢
For several years, both the British and American armies were tile
greatest part of the year within her borders.âAs if these evils
were not fufficient, at the end of the war, an import, for State pur
Â£ofes, was eftablifhcd by the two adjoining States, from whom
(he was obliged to receive all her imports, whereby (he was bled
at every pore. During this whole time, the req 111 fit ions of Con
gress were made on her, without any allowance for her peculiar
circumstances, the other States had fharcd a milder fate. As fai;
as it wasin her power, she complied faithfully with themâand
in addition to her exertions, she has relieved the diftrelTes of her
citizc ns, by paying the intercft due to them from the government,
without refpiCl to the species of debt. In this manner, (he has
draggled with difficulty, nnder anopprcflive burthen, 'til the pe
riod arrived" which she thought, proimfed an alleviation to her
di ft rcfTcs,
The ability of the new government, (he fondly hoped would
have eased the burthen, and calmed the minds of her citizens, who
were daily leaving the State to find a happier cliipate to the north
ward and the westward, where heavy taxation would not reach
them. I hold up these circumstances of an individual State, to
(hew that she cannot go much further; every citizen she looses,
leaves the incumbrance the greater on those who remain behind.
At this moment, fir, in one town(hip of that State, there are be
tween 2 and 300 cxecu.ions out for the arrears of Is it not
[Whole NO. 126.]policy then and the bed of portcy to equalize the h.irthens of so
arduous a itruggle as was brought upon us by ths late war, and
prevent a filler State from finking after getting through so far ?-â
Is there any reaion that after exerting her felt' to the utmost, and
aiding you in the day of didrefs, that now you are in polfelTijii
of the relources of the country, and (he is deprived of the only
means'fhe had of helping herfelf (I mean by her paper money)
that Ihe fhiuld Itili be left to druggie on without relief ?âBut, lir,
if you reful'c this m-alure and do not realfume these debts, it rs not
contemplated by any one, to embrace the excise, but to leave that
to the individual Stares. What then mud be the fitu3tion of New-
Jersey, if New-York, and Pennsylvania should edablifh a general
cxcifc for the payment of their particular citizens? Would not
New-Jersey pay her full proportion, as die did formerly under
their imposts ? It never can be confident with good policy, thus
to leave your citizens to such different measures of public judice.
The last evidence of the policy of thi* measure arises from the
impofTibility of otherwise funding the domedic debt with cer
tainty, whiie the States are necefTitated to claim particular sour
ces of revenue. This mud prodirce aclafhing of jurifdi6tion,_ and
a continual jarring of intereds.
I fh juld now close mv argument fir, wÂ£fc it not for an objeÂ£tion
which I confefs when 1 fird heard it, druck me with some con
viction, but on a closer examination, I found not to bear a scru
tiny. It was, that if the measure could be carried by a very small
majority, it wdulrt be highly impolitic, because if a right measure
and now rejected, it could easily be adopted hereafter; but if a
Vrong measure and now a'dopted, it could not easily be remedied
â¢when the evil was acknowledged.
Sir, if thedebt is a jud one againd the United States, aivi we
are able to pay it, I cannot admit the idea of a longer reiulalâthe
delay of jodice is a denial of judiceâwhat would be the confe
rence of paying this debt and afterwards being convinced of the
injudice of it? You would charge it to the individual State, and
the only loss would be the intered of the intered you might pay â
But, fir, if you refufe it and find you are wrong, you are doing an
afct of palpable injudice by which you may ruin thou (and s of your
citizens and depopulate your States by driving the mod valuable
of thrm to seek an asylum in the wilds of the Ohio and Lake Erie.
Jt will be a very inefficient excuse to ouf differing hod of cre
ditors, that from local principles and private motives, there could
only be obtained a fmail majority to do them judice, and if we
â were wrong in the refufal, we could set all right when we were
convinced of it. I believe this will scarcely judify us in our own
eyes. But will not this delay impede the operation of the general
fydemâand if this once takes place, who can forcfec where it will
end. An attempt to do judice, can do us no cfiential injury even
if we should be wrong, but a refufal in our present circumdances
may raise a spirit, that cannot easily be layed.
Although the quedion, fir, before you is on the assumption of
the State debts, so called for fake of distinction, yet as an obic&ion
had been made inthe Houfeyedcrdav,and an endeavor used to se
parate this part of the domedic debt from that which is founded
on certificates given by the immediate officers of Congrcfs.j luppo
iing this to be a fubjeÂ£t efTentially different from the one referred
to the committee, I thought it my duty to fhrw that having been
contracted by the United States in Congress aflembled, for the ge
neral defence of the union, there remained no foundation in rcafon
or judice for the objettion, although the fetilements of the ac
counts, and the balances due, were certified by the individual
States. And I think that it mud as clearly appear that no solid
xeafon can be assigned, why the individual States should not now
be delivered from the burthen of them, since you have delivered
her from the means of payment.
These arguments address themselves to the undefrdanding and
the judgment.âlt is nndcr their impression, and from a thorough
convifiion of their force and propriety under every view ot the
subjeCt, that I have heretofore and shall dill give my vote for the
teairumption of these debts, and of course, in favor of the a
mendment now before the committer.

(CONTI NUATION.)
" ]n a general may, it may be prefunud a lcgifla_
tor promote! the public good, by attending to the im
mediate interejl of his tonflituents
NO mail fliould be reproached for feeling
local attachments, or for fuff'ering his
mind to indulge a partiality for his friends and
acquaintance. This not only corresponds with
the impulles of nature, but may be compatible
â with the general welfare of the community. It
is very certain, if every person takes care of the
people of his own diftriÂ«ft,*no portion of inhabi
tants will be neglected. There will however ex
id some difficulty in carrying this principle into
eifetft, even where it is jud ; and there are like
wise cases -which may be deemed exceptions to it.
If every legislator look to the immediate in
tered of the didriet he represents, it may be laid,
that the general interest will be effectually ascer
tained and promoted. The majority fliould and
will prevail, and the common welfare will be em
braced as perfectly, as though each man were ac
tuated by the molt fubliir.e sentiments of bene
volence. It amounts to the fame thing. The
tit mo It purity of intention, and the warmed glow
ofgencrofity could not more than recommend and
pursue the major intereds of the community;
and this will be done by acting upon the princi
ple now under difculGon. The difficulty, to
which I have before alluded, coniilts not so much
in the partiality a legislator feelsTOr his particular
con)'ituents, as in his notbeingable to determine
the bed manner of promoting their intered. If
he consults their opinion, it may prove a very dif
ferent tiling frotYi their welfare. The circuin
fances of a people often change foonerthan their
sentiments ; and the reason, upon which old ha
bits were originally formed, may be removed
while the habits themselves retain their force.
From this 1 infer that though a legislator may at.
tend ro the particular intered of his didricft, he
may sometimes be compelled to adt contrary to
their notions and wiihes. Besides it often hap
pens, that a law is enacted upon foine new occa
iion, about which the public mind has never exer
cised itfelf. In all fucli cases the legislator can
have 110 reference to any opinion previously ef
tabliflied among the people.
But there maybe cases where a representative
may ad; contrary to the direct iniereft of his dif
triift, l.>/owi"?/y, and wittingly. A certain part of
the community may Hand ill need of legislative aids
orgrants, which will be attended with .inieli snore
advantage to it, than will balance the inconven
ience fultained by the other puts of the commu
nity. To encourage and prote<slnew fettleu>ems>
or new arts and manufactures may not apportion
the benefits eqrvtUy among all clalies ot inhabi
tants in any country ; but a legislator may ltill
suppose himlelf juftiiiable in fa
vors of government, in a partial manner, on im
portant and lpecial occasions.
There is still another point of light in which
the fiibjetft of public opinion Hiaj be viewed.â
When a law is palled, if it meets with the general
concurrence of the public, it may be deemed an
evidence that it is founded in propriety, and will
be attended with utility. The public opinion
Ihould therefore be exercised upon a ineafure al -
ter it is put into operation, rather than while it
is in contemplation. It can try and prove the
law better tlxtn it can diredt its origin or paflage.

the Hon. Wll.i.iam Pac.a, Efq.who delivered an
excellent charge to the grand jiiry, of which the
following are the concluding ientences :
Having thus, gentlemen briefly stated the de
rivation of the authority of the court and your
4utyâthe fuperiqrity of one general govertnent,
formed by the people, and solemnly confirmed
by them.âthe neceflity of instituting courts of
admiralty and courts with exclnflvecriminal ju
riOikftion, to take cognizance of crimes and of-,
fences against the United States ; and having laid
before you a general state of the fubje<fts fg/r
your enquiry, 1 cannot part with you without ex.
pressing an ardent wish, that in your refpediive
counties and neighbourhoods, you would im
press upon your fellow citizens the important
duties of economy, sobriety and industry. The
supreme Being did not place man upon earth to
be a sauntering, unitnployed, unaccountable
creature. Your own reason and observation, and
the sacred scriptures, declare the contrary, and
unite in afiurances, that idlentis is the root of
all evil, and the bane of public and private hap
pinefs. The welfare and prosperity, the gran
deur and glory of these United States, depend
upon enlightened manners and habits, a manly
and vigorous exertion, and an animated industry.
With these sentiments, gentlemen, I difinift
yon to your deliberationsâhaving a confidence
in the wisdom and justice with which you will
discharge your office." ,

the ex pence thereof, submitted the following report :
That, as far as the nature of the cafe will admit, they have in
the schedule annexed, complied with the order of the house, hav
ing due regard to the ftnte of the treasury.
That the committee have confined them selves, in a great mca
fure, to books neceflary for the use of the legiflativc and executive
departments, and not often to be found in private or in circula
ting libraries.
That, nevertheless, without farther provision of books on laws

of the Icgiflatuie and other officers of government may be cither
deprived of the use of such books when neceflary, 01 be obliged
at every feflion, to tranfportto the feat of the general government
a confida-able part of their libraries; it I'eldom happening that
they can otherwifyommand such books when requisite, without
trelpalling too much on the indulgence of their friends.

1000 dollars,be appropriated in the present fdlion,and that the sum
of 500 dollars be hereafter annually appropriated to the purchase

FRIDAY, JUNE 25
The report of the committee of conference on the amendments
to the bill providing ihe means of intercour.fe between the United
Stales and foreign nations, was taken into confederation.âThe firft
amendment was to ftnke out 30 thousand, and to insert 40 thou
sand dollars.
It was moved that the house ftiould agree to this amendment ;
this motion was opposed.
It was said that the committee had exceeded theiÂ»- commission
in proposing this alteration in the bill, as both houses had agreed in
the sum of 30,000 dollarsâit was further laid that more than one
minister plenipotentiary was unnccelfaryâthat the court of Great-
Briiain had sent only a Consul to this country âand that from the
present appearances, no advantages could be expelled to aufo
from fending a minilter, equivalent to the expence ; the neceffiiy
contended for is merely conjecturalâand by that rule the mini!-,
ters plenipotentiary may be encreafed, and one lent to Spam and
another to Portugal; if only one minister is sent to Europe, the
firft sum will be fufficient, with refpeft to the Court of London,
a Charge des affairs will probably answer every purpose.
In support of the motion it was urged that the President of the
United States is by the Constitution vested with the power of ap
pointing such foreign officers as he may N think necessary, and it
must devolve upon the legislature to make provifton for defraying
the expence. The Committee of conference did not rely on their
own judgmentâthey confultedthe Secretary of foreign atffirs ; his
opinion was that in the present (ltuation of this country with refptcf.
to foreign nation*, two ministers and two Charge des Affaires were
nece(Tary;a minister at the Court of Verfatlles :sgenerallyconcedcd
to be requisite ; the peculiar situation of this country with respeCt
to the polls, the Northern and Eastern frontiers and the state of
our commerce in refpeff to Great-Britain, can scarcely leave a
doubt of the neceflity and importance of fending a minister to
that country ; this being the State of affairs a less sum than that
propofeditis demonftrablv evident, will not be found adequate,
The question on concurring in this amendment was carried in
the affirmative.
The other amendments were agreed to, with amendments.
The House then took up the bill providing for the government
and regulation of seamen in the Merchant's service. This bhi
had been committed to a feleft committee, who reported on the
blanks, also iiindry amendments to the bill. These were several
ly read and agreed to. Other amendments were addedâand the
bill was ordered to be engrossed.
In Comrrfittee of the whole House on the bill concerning the
trade and navigation of the United States.
This bill contains the discrimination in the duty on tonnage,
between veffcls belonging to nations in treaty with the United
States, and those of nations with whom no treaty exists.
A motion to postpone the bill Â©ccafioned a lengthy debate,
which was not determined at 3 o'clock, when a motion wasmade
that the Committee should rife, and ask leave to fit againâthis
was carried in the affirmative.
A meflage was received from the Senate, inforroig the House
that they have concurred in the amendments proposed to the
bill providingthe means of intercourse between the United States
and foreign nations. Also, that they havepaffed the bill for the
relief of Nathaniel Twining.

An intolerent spirit is the source of all the tyranny which now
does, or ever cid exi-ft ; for those who condemn, reproach and re
vile their neighbors, for holding different opinions from them
selves, would, if they poflefled the power,extirpate all who would
not fubferibe to their political creed.
It is infinitely eaficr to rai>, than to reason : Hence this is the
weapon uÂ£ed by the ignorant, intereiled declaimers against govern

It is not a compliment to human nature to fay, that flimfy de

experience and the fitnefs of things ; but it is a truth.
It may be a profitable enquiry, How many of those who amuse

principal door by the Mayor of Paris, the depu

All the members were placed on teats raised in
the form of an amphitheatre. The Municipality
occupied the opposite fide. Low mass having
been celebrated on an altar, prepared in front
of the grates of the choir, the Abbe Mulot pro

BRABANTiNE REVOLUTION.
Brussels intelligence of the 22d of keb.
After such a sudden revolution, the calm, ot
rather the stagnation which now prevails is aflo
nifhingâThe fei ious indifpoiition of the Empe
ror may no doubt be afligned as a reason. 1 iie
Count Cobenzsl remains at Luxembourg, without
being able to exercise his fun<stion as pacific com
miliioner, unless it be in restoring affairs as far as
poflible on their ancient footing, to the latisfac
tion of the inhabitants of that province. It is
said that the proceflions and fraternities to which
the Belgic nation is much attached, have been re
eftabliflied there in all their splendor. The Au
ditor General, Orlandini, has arrived at Luxem
bourg from Vienna, to conducfl the trial of the
former minifler plenipotentiaries, Count de
Trauttmanfdorff and general d'Alton, for their
infeVplicable conduct, to which the success of the
malcontents is ascribed. In expectation that lie
could juflify himfelf personally before the Empe
ror, general d'Alton set out for Vienna ; but lie
had not yet arrived, when he received orders to
ret Â»rn, he went firft to Baden, and from thence
to ."reves, where it is said he has fallen lick.
Paper war is carried on with a great deal of
warmth between the oligarchical and patriotic
parties. The former employs the arms of religi
on, which fervesits purposes as well against the
democratic as it did against the Imperial innova
tions. Thc declaration of the Belgic people in fa
vor of the present constitution, has been sent to
| all the prieftt and curates, to have it signed by
every one of every sex, age and condition ; seve
ral ofthefe curates take it to their flocks, offering
the choice of signing it, or the lofsof every spi
ritual favor. An Srtithor of this party has pub
liflied a pamphlet entitled Truth, with the motto
Fiat Lux. Another of the opposite party has
publiihed one entitled Gri: vances oj the Brabatt
ti>ie<, wherein lie complains of the tardiness of
the present government, in securing the liberties
of the Belgians, and of ihe despotism exercised
in its nÂ» ne, particularly of the power arrogated
by the Aflembly, known by the name of the pa
triotic committee, and which, notwithstanding the
name, traverses every convention and confer
ence of the people, opposed to its opinion. A
third, which places at its head neither too fa ft no'r
too flow, or an anfvier to the pretended patriotic ques
tions ; maintains, " That the present form of
" government cannot be permanent, because it
" has not been consecrated by any law, nor any
" tribunal, much lei's by the citizens afltmbled
" in a national capacity ; that neverthelels the
" fovercigniy belonging to the nation, the nati
" on ought to fix the mode of its government."
The system of this author has the advantage of
being supported by two of the mdft considerable
noblemen of the nation, Dukes d'Ahremberg and
d'Urfel. The firft ofthefe has openly avowed
its principles, by refufing, as chief of the fermens
and volunteer companies, to take the oath, un
less it is " to the nation, or the pover legally con
fiituted by it." A refufal wliofe example follow
ed by others, mult create great embarrassment to
the ncu fovcrcigns of Brabant. The province of
Flanders, without having altered the forms of
their conflitution, have taken the oath in the
name of the nation ; and to avoid the reproach
that has been cad on the Brabanters of conduct
ingtheir business with mystery, they have resolv
ed to communicate to the public, "by means of
the press, the result of their deliberations.
In the midfl of this diversity of opinions, which
involves our situation in great uncertainty, it is
matter of co-nfolation that the confederation will
be soon strengthened by theaccellion of the pro
vince of timbourg. The states of this Durchy
have been assembled at Kenri Chapelle for three
days together, the 9th, loth and nth inft. and
have decided to acknowledge that the Emperor's
sovereignty is at an end ; they have not hitherto
published the Brabantine vianifeflo in their pro
vince ; but in consequence of the above refblu
tion, they have appointed deputies to make fur
ther arrangements with the states of Brabant.
These deputies are the Abbe de Rolduc, Count
Hoen Neuf Chateau, formerly envoy from the
committee of Breda to the Court of Berlin, and
M. de l'Aflanlt. The justiciary order has been
re-eltablilhed in the pi ovince, "as it existed before
the month of April 1757. Consequently the new
sovereign council of Linibourg ceases.
I The Bruflels Gazette of this day assures, that
two camps of French troops are about being
formed, one in Flanders, the other at Givet ;
and that four regiments of cavalry have orders'
to rendezvous at Lillo.
