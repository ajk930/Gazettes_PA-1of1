" It is not improbable that if all parts of the world
were equally enlightened by science, all nations
would embrace articles of faith, nearly fnntlar to each

(Continuation of the arguments in support of the position, that the
universal diffufion of literature will precede aud prepare the
way ior the universal prevalence of religion.)
THO mankind, in their native date of igno
rance, have always Tome imprefiions of duty,
yet so incapable are they of reasoning, or think
ing beyond the reach of their senses, that the
founders of rriigious fyfteins have ever represen
ted the Supreme Being through the mfcdium of
images, aÂ» the only method by which they could
gain credit with the fliort-fighted multitude. If
Mahomet be considered as an exception, and his
religion as an improvement upon rank idolatry,
this willaifift the argument; since it is well known
the Arabians had made great improvements in
several branches of literature, and of course were
fitted to embrace a religion more rational than
PaganismâWith refpecl to Africa it is to be ob
served, that cliriftianity was never received in
that quarter of the earth, except by the nations
bordering upon the Mediterranean, which by
their intercourse with the Greeks and Romans,
had made some progress towards civilization.
The Greeks and Romans, it is true, previous
to the publication of christianity, were like the
reft of the world, wrapt up in the absurdities of
Paganifin, and doubtless the bulk of them reposed
implicit confidence in the myfteriesoftheZW/'Art:
Oracle. But in justice to the wiser part of tliofe
nations, wemuft allow, that they entertained as
rational ideas of a Deity, and of human obligati
ons, as the modern christians, in proportion to
their improvements in literature. And we may
venture to aflert, that, so far as *e are nble to
judge from their writings, the morality of So
cratrs and PtiTP Uir ts-ue proportion to
that of our best christian divines, as the phylical
knowledge of Hy pocratEs doesto that of Boer
have ; the mathematical inveftigatiohs of Arc
himt.des to those of Sir Issac Newton; or the
politics of Solon and Lycurgus to those of Fe
terthe G*eat, and of Mo n r esqu ie v. There
fore fettiug aside all regard to revelation, and
supposing morality to be a part of religion, this
remark proves, beyond dispute, that the progress
of religion, will naturally be proportioned to im
provements in literature.
I proceed to consider more particularly the
propagation of christianity, which will furni(h a
decisive argument in our favor, if we can prove
what appears to be true, that literature has, in
every instance, preceded the reception and esta
blishment of that religion ; and that wherever it
has been embraced, its general purity has ever
been proportioned to the national state of litera
ture.
It is a remark of all ecclefialiical hifl oriaiis, and
of all tire advocates of chriftiavtity, as a inoft in
conteftible proof of its divine origin, that it was
publiffaed at a time, and in a part of the world,
where mankind had made cli<Â° greatest proficiency
in human knowledgeâwhere rliey were most ca
pable of comprehending the (fcblHriity of its doc
trines and precepts ; and of detecting the fraud
and expofingits absurdities. I would extend this
remark iiill farther, and observe that this im
provement of the human mind was a cirpuniftance
most favorable to the propagation of religionâ
and that to this natural cause only cap weafcribe
its rapid and extensive diffufion, in opposition to
the malice and power of its enemies. Had the
Greeks and Ramans been a3 ignorant as the Hot.
tentots of Cafftavia, or as servile as the of
IndoÃao, Nekv, '!>,* jrw and.Da mi it .an would
have crushed christianity in its infancy, with the
fame eafc, fhat Tamerlane could fupprefsit in
Alia. (To be cintinmed.)

magnificence ; their ancient parchments,pictures,
and statues, and the virtues of their ancestors ;
and if these fail, as they seldom have done, they
have recourse to artifices,difiimulation,hypocrify, ]
flattery, impoftnre, empiricifin, quackery and
bribery. What chance has humble, modest, ob
scure and poor merit, in futh a fcra-mble ? Na
tions,perceiving that the still faiall voice of merit
was drowned in the insolent r< . â¢ of such impos
tures: and that they were cwi''antly the dupes
of impudence and knavery, in national elections,
without a polfibility of a reiliedy, have fought
for something more permanent than the popular
voice to designate honor. Many nations have
attempted to annex it to land, presuming that a
good estate would at least furniih the means of a
good education ; and have resolved that thdfe
who ihould poflefs certain territories, ihould have
certain legillative, executive and judicial powers,
over the people. Other nations have endeavor
ed to connect honor with offices ; and the names
and ideas at least of certain moral virtues and in
tellectual qualities have been by law annexed to
certain offices, as veneration, grace, excellence,
honor, serenity, majesty.âOther nations ha+e at
tempted to annex honor to families, without any
regard to lands or offices. The Romans allowed
none, but those who had polfelfed curule offices,
to have statues or portraits. He, Whc*. had ima
ges or pictures of his ancestors, was called noble.
He who had no statue or picture but his own,
was called a new man. Those who had none at
all, were ignoble. Other nations have united all
those ihftitutions : connected lands, offices and
familiesâmade them all delcend together, and
honor, public attention, conlideration and con
gratulation along with them. This lids been the
policy of Europe : and it is to this institution
which she owes her fnperiority, nwaraud peace,
in legislation and commerce, in agriculture, na
vigation, arts fciencesand niami "actures, to Asia
and Africa. TheP: families il.'m diftinguifhcd
by property, honors and privileges, by defend
ing themselves have been obliged to defend the
people agaiult the encroachments of despotism.
They have been a civil and political militia, con â 
ftantly watching the designs of the standing ar
mies, and courts ; and by defending their own
rights, liberties, properties and privileges, they
have been obliged,in fame degree,to defend thole
of the people. iJut there were several eflential
defects in this policy : one was that the people
took rto rational defend themselves,
either against these great families or the courts.
They had no adequate reprefenration of them
selves in the fovereiguty. Another was that it
never was determined \v'a 'e the sovereignty re-,
sidedâgenerally it was claimed by Kings; but
not admitted by the nobles. Sometimes every
Baron pretended to be sovereign in his own ter
ritory-; at other times the sovereignty was claim
ed by an aflembly of the nobles, under the name
of States or Cortes. Sometimes the United au
thority of the King and the Stares was called the
sovereignty. The common people had no ade
quate and independent (hare in the legislature,
and found themselves harrdfled to difeover who
was the sovereign, and whom they ought to o
bey, as much as they ever had been or could be
to determine who had the ntoft merit. A thou
sand years of Baron's wars, cauling universal
darknels, ignorance and barbarity, etlded at last
in simple monarchy, not by express stipulation,
but by tacit acquiescence, in aluioft ail Europe ;
the people prefering a certain -sovereignty in a
single person, to endless disputes, about merit and
sovereignty, which never did and never will
produce any thing but ariftocratical anarchy ;
and the nobles contenting themselves with a fecu
rity of their property privileges, by a govern
ment of fixed law-s, registered tvnd interpreted
by a judicial power, which they called fo-Vereign
tribunals, thpugh the legislation and execution
were in a single person. In this system to con
troul the nobles, the church joined the Kings and
common people.
The progress of reason, letters aiul isience,
has weakened the church and ftrfengthenpd the
common people ; who, if they,are lioneftly asd
prudently c'ondudled by thafe who hav-e their
confidence, will moll infallibly obtain a ihare in
every legillature. But if the common people are
advifedto aim at colletiing the whole sovereignty
in single national aflembUes, as they are by the
Duke de la Rochefoucault and the Marquis of]
Cordercet ; or at the abolition of the Regal ex
ecutive authority ; or at a division of the execu
tive power, as they are by a posthumous publics-
477
I tion oftheAbby de Mablv, the/ will fail of their
I delired liberty as certainly as emulation and ri
valry are founded in human nature and inlepara
ble from civil affairs. It is not to flatter the paf
fidns of the people to be sure, nor it; it the way to
obtain a present enthusiastic popularity to tell
them that in a single aflembly, they will act as
arbitrarily and tyrannically as any despot, but
it is a sacred truth, and as demonstrable as any
proposition whatever, that i sovereignty in a iin
gle aflembly must neceflarily, and will certainly
be exercised by a majority as tyrannically as any
sovereignty was ever exercised by Kings or No
bles. , And if a ballance of paffipiis and interest
is not fcientiflically concerted, the present strug
gle in Europe will be little beneficial to mankind,
and produce nothing but another thoul'and yerrs
of feudal fanaticifm under new and strange names.
Extract from a fpeculatkn ftgmd Caud'tdus in the
Farmer's Journal of May 17.
WHY is so mu'ch attention paid to trifling me
morials ? They are not matters ef general
concern. And why Ihould we (upport men at Con
gress to trifle away their time upon them ? The*
anfwertoqueltionsof this kind is obvious. Justice
is uniform. It is the fame wheil adininiftered to
an individual, a state, or a nation. If all contri
bute to the eftabliflimerlt and support of govern
ment in order that their persons and properties
may be protected : Have not ill a demand on gov
ernment for that protection ? The reciprocal
rights arid duties of the people, and the supreme
power of a nation constitute substantial justice.
There is a mutual dependence between the lu
preme power and the people. And since the
whole government is compol'ed of individuals,
does it appear inconsistent that individuals Ihould
be heard in thi public councils ? Much depends
on public Opinion in matters relating to govern.-
tnent. Some deference therefore liiould be paid
to it. In ordir .tb the confidents of the peo
ple they must be fully convinced that theit memo
rials and petitions will be duly attended to when
they are not directly repugnant torhe interest and
Welfare of the community. And better would it
be sot government, to expend 100 dollars in an
attempt to do justice to a man, or body of men,
than for them to defraud either of them ot 10
dollars by a direct relufal <of justice."

Vn the proposition to encreafe the duty if tonnage on foreign bottom
MR. Madison said that he was friendly to the proportion,
as itsobje&was an extension ot the Anierican navigation,
but had very great doubts whether it would answer the design of gen
tlemen so far as it was pbinted against that nation, whose shipping
most interfered with the American shipping; we cannot at prefeflt
enter into a full competiori with theÃritifh nation in this bufmefs.
âHe entered into a general confederation of the influence this en
hanced duty would have on the navigation Of the European nai
tionsâand doubted much the policy of laying this duty ori the
(hipping of France: By some reccnt tranfattions it appears that
oui commercial advantages with some of the powers of Europe
will be greatly encreafcd ; the trade of France will probably be of
three times the benefit to the United States with that of any other
commercial country whatever. He gave a detail ttf the encourage
aient which France gave to the oyl bufmefs, and in this encourage
ment he intimated that sentiments of friendfllip were mingled with
those of interest and policyâthe exportation of tobacco to that
kingdom is an object of very great importance ; rice is another ar
ticle, which begins to be received under great advantages there ;
floUr and grain will always in 4 or 5 years find a great derriand in
that country ; this is at present thecale, and frorti the {late ot the
harvests from time to time the fame will frequently happen ; the
preference they give to (hips arid vessels biiilt in the United States
should be taken into considerationâthis is a very important branch
of bufmefsâfait provision will become anothet- article of exportâÂ»
advantages of which will felt by the mod interior and re
mote parts of this country. The French Weft-India Islands
admit our veflelg ; it is true the access is contratted, but experi
ence wiU continue to point out their true policy; still the mode of
carrying on commerce with those islands 14 very advantageous to
us, as it is carried on in our own bottoms.âHe much doubted the
eligibility of the measure as it might conduce to influence the na
tions of Europe to make a common cause of the reftri&ions laid
iridifcriminately on the maritime powers of Europf*.
The great object of this Qpeech wais a difcrimuiatlon between
BritiAi and other foreign (hipping of nations not fa alliance, and
that of those which are---andpurhiing the idea further he observed,
that a consuming country has tne advantage over a naanufa&uririg
country; wecan do better without Great-Britain than they can do
without us ; articles of luxury may be retrenched with advantage.
He attended to the objeftioafrom the Southern States who are
so deeply connected with the Britifli; said it was to ike lamented
that mcafures calculated to promote the general good ihotild mili
tate with any particular interdlâa maritime force in cafe of war is
the only hope of the Southern Statesânot that he was in favor of
a navyâbut the eligibility of an increase of those resources which
might be converted into such a marine force as would be absolutely
necessary on such an emergency, must be obvious to every one.â
In cafe of war the Southern States would be the ftrft objeÂ£l of at
tack.
The Squthern States may build fliips and ia this bufmefs enjoy
fame advantages over all the reft. There are cases in which it is
better to do nothing than not to da a great dealâb? intimated
[Whole No. 120.]that it might fee good policy to inWrdift the vtlTcli of all nations,
from carrying our produce
Mr., Fitzfimons obfervcd that the question was fully agitated
the last feflionâhe was one ot those who were in favor of the dif
-crimination at that timeâbut he now greatly doubted the pro
priety ol the measure. France does not turnifh Hups in fuchnum
bers as to make it any great object with them to be exempted.â
thole measures which ase calculated to diminish the navigation of
lier rivals, she would" consider as an indemnification for the en
hancement of the duty on her ownâWith the additional heavy
tonnage nÂ«w proposed, Great-Britain has so great a surplus o
Hhipping, that foe cannot employ them so advantageously in an\
way, as in the trade of America. America is the best fo
reign market that Great-Britain has: This every man may be
convinced of who looks at what cpvers him. He instanced a nam
ber of articles (cfpecially lumber) which Great-Britain is abso
lutely dependent on America forâand (he has no market for up
wards of four millions gallons of rum bt* the United States ;
The sale of this rum is a source of greater profit than all her other
"Well-India trade. We enjoy great and encreafmg commercial
advantages, from the adoption of the constitution. I should be
extremely sorry to risk these advantages by adopting the motion. '
and if this is to be a condition of enhancing the tonnage. I flia.l
as at present informed, vote against it.
Mr. Ames in oppotition to the motion, observed, that from the
introductory observations of the gentleman, he anticioared some
thing which would conduce much to the advantage of our alliesâ
Lut it had terminated in a proportion to teftify ourgratitude to
that nation, which in any event cannot be nrioh benefited by the
difcrim.nation proposed, it it should be adopted. Adverting o
â what had bern said upor treat ct. He doubted whether any
treaties were of any advantage to us, and therefore h
was not solicitous to have them increased. Our (hips are at pre
sent (notwithlkaiiding the treaty) admitted with almost as much"
facility into the Brittfhas into the French Island*. The great de
sign in the increase of the tonnage, is to incrcafe our own naviga
tionâ"jbut the gentleman's plan is to teftify our gratitude to o 1
Â«lltes, by waging a commercial war with nations not in treat).
Thequeit on the last feflion was thoroughly discussed-, and he ho
ped that it would not be renewed the prefentâcfpecially when
it is coniid"red that the other house weTe so strongly agamll it.

GENTLEMEN,
ALTHOUGH it is easier for you to conceive, than fdrme to ex
plain ihe pleating frnfations which have been excited in my
breast, by yourcoiigrttuUtions on my appointment to the head of .
this ri&njj; Republic : Yet I mutt take the liberty to thank you sin
cerely for the polite manner in which you felicitate our Country
men, and teftify you' regard to me on this occasion.
In addition to that reward for your fufferings and frrviceawhich
arises from the consciousness of having done your duty, you have
Monuments more expreflive of your merits than even th' .
universal applaufeof your Country, in the establishment of its Inde
pendence and Sovereignty. Nor fhouldany poflible circumstance s
of poverty or adverfny compel you to give up that sweet fatisfa&i- -
on for the part vou-4iave ailed, which ought to attend you as well ;
<hc yiciflitudes of life as in the moment of dissolution.
The candour of your fellow-cii zens acknowledges the patri

CINCINNATI,
The objeA for which your gallantry encountered ctery din
ger, and your virtue sustained unparalleled difficulties, has happily
been attained. A government, promiiing protection and prospe
rity to the People of the United States, is eftabliflied ; and its ope
rations hitherto have been luch as to juftify the most sanguine ex
pe&ations of further fuccefsâlt was naturally to be expelled, that
lives which had long since been devoted on the Altar of Ireedom,
could never be offered at the Shrines of Anarchy or Despotism â
And the offer which you. make of the refid'JC of those.lives to sup
port the Administration of this Government is not less a proof of
its excellence, than an encouragement for those concerned in its
execution to use their best endeavours to make it a lource of ex ten
sive and permanent bleflings to their Country.
Whatever titles my military services may have given me to
the regard of my Country, they are principally corroborated by
the firm fupportof my brave and faithful atlociates in the field :
And, if any consideration is to be attributed to the fuccefsful exer
cise of my civil duties, it proceeds, in a great mcjfure,from the
wisdom of the Laws, and the facilitv which the difpofiiion of my
feilow-cuizens has given to their administration.
To the- most affedlionate wiihes for your temporal happinck,
I add a fervent prayer for your eternal felicity.

(CIRCULAR.)
To the STATE SOCIETIES of the CINCINNATI,
Gentlemen,
HAVING made choice of all our officers for the three ensuing
years, as will appear bv the enclosed certified lifts ; and hav
ing completed all the I ifinefs before us, we could not, however,
f parate without addrellmg you, on the situation and proipefcl of
the affairs ol the United States.
Withhearts filled wujilovetoour native climes, and gratitude
to the author of every good gift, who has caftout Idtin such pl-a
fant placet ; we rejoice that our countrymen m rapidly recbv.r
---i ig from the calamities occasioned bv the lata war, and that they
are at last favored with -a government which will probably secure
tl-thera the enjoyment of all the benefits they had a right to expect
from the revolution. Already We percerveihatagriculture, com
merce, rhanufattures, private happiness andpoblte prosperity, en
rreafe in a wonderful manner, under the auspicious influence ps
â¢his government. And from a view of all the ciicumftances, we
irejuftiÃed in a belief, that our profpefi of felicity is as fair as that
of any nation under heaven.
While we recall to rnind that you were the Chiefs of that glo
rious baad of heroei, who merited and obtained the diftinguiflird
appellation of the PATRIOT ARMY, we feel all the endear,
ments of our former connexion recur with redoubled force. The
world considered that charafier as the belt guarantee for your
future eondufl. Nor has your condufl ai any time deceived the
mofc fangnrae expe&ations nt the friends of freedom.
The general tenor of your behavior, fmce the war, and parti-
I during the. period in which the present government was
| formed and eteblimed, has been so perfectly unexceptionable,
and so entirely conloftant to your profeflions, as to entitle ybu to
the univtrfal approbation of your fellow-citizens.
It gives us inexpteflible pleasure to find.tbat the unraafonable
and illiberal clamour, which at one moment had been excited a
gainst our institution, has totally subsided.
The accounts which we annually fee'from all parts of the con
tinent of the manner in which you celebrate the declaration of In
dependence, on the fourth day of July, the day fixed for.your
State meetings, afford us The reasons for
the recognitiefa of that feftivafare so obvious Â»nd important, that
we hope yton will ever continue to consider that day, as a day of
Thanksgiving. , , ,
_ We presume not to give yoa any advice, for the regulation of
the internal concerns of your focietirs. But we are persuaded that
you will do good to all men, whenforver and wheresoever op
portunities will perhtu ; arid particularly that you will, to the ut
most of your ability, alleviate the penury and diftrefles of those
who have borne with you the burden of the war. As many in
rtances have already occurred of widows, orphans and unfortunate
members of your focietres, who claim and receive support from
your beneficence, it behoves you to place your funds upon the
best possible footing, to accomplish the,truly benevolent and fra
ternal purposes for they were intended. Sii|ce it is but
too justly to he apprehended, that the number of persons who
will be entitled to yoalr alfiftance will rather encreafe than dimiuifh.
We mod ardently desire, that the character of the Cincinnati
may continue to be lefpefted-, in consequence of. their completing
the glory of foldicrs, by acting well the part of citizens. With
this objefl in view, we doubt not that you will afliduoufly culti
vate all the virtues of peaceable and patriotic citizens, especially
industry, frugality, honesty, and a fixed determination to support
the government of your country.
It if necefTary for the Ulterior arrangement* of our society *
large, that you should transmit to our Secretary General, accurate
returns of the perfonscompofing your State Societies, as soon as
they can be conveniently completed.
We forward to you by this conveyance, the copy of an adÂ»

you to the holy keeping of Almighty God ; and to wilh you eve

A Jhort aocount of the Hon. Theodorick Bland
Esq. deceased, one of the Virginia Delegation.
Mr. Bland was a native or Virginia, and de
scended from an ancient and refpedtable family
in that state. He was bred to phytic, but upon
the commencement of the American war, having
been educated in very liberal principles, he quitted
the practice, and took an a<siivt part in the cause
of his country. He soon rof" f r om a volunteer to
the rank of Colonel, and had thd command giv
en him of a regiment of dragoons. While in the
army, he frequently signalized himfelf by brilli
ant anions. In i 779 he was appoipted to the com
mand of the Convention troops at Albemarle bar
racks in Virginia, and continued in that fitnation
till some time in 1 7SO, when he was elected to a
feat in Congress. He then resigned his commiHi
on of Colonel, and continued in Congress three
| years, the time allowed by the confederation ; af
ter the expiration of this term, he again return
ed to Virginia and was chosen a member of their
State Legiilature. On the great queltioji of the
Constitution, Mr. Bland was opposed thereto, as
fuppofingit repugnant to the interests of his coun- I
try, and was in the minority that voted against
the ratification. When the Constitution was at
length adopted, Mr. Bland, acting in conformity
to the character of a good titizen, submitted to
the voice of the majority, and became a candi
date to represent the diftridt in which he lived,
in the Congress of the United States. He was
elected without opposition, and has had the ho
nor of representing them in the firft Congress
under the new Constitution. Mr. Bland's cliaradt
er in the present Congress has been such as to
merit the warmest esteem of his countrymen in
general. In his character, he was honeit, open,
and candid, and bore an universal good charadter
in his intercourse with mankind.
On the DEATH of Col. THEODORICK BLAND
HT'HO borne alike on Time's unresting bier,
A All claim from some the tributary tear ;
Y ct grief J uperiot should .bedew the grave,
Where reits the wife, the patriot, and the brave /
Oh ! fkiird alike in Councils to preside,
Or in the Field the martial band to guide,
Long shall Virginia mourn the fatal blow.
That laid her Warrior and her Statesman low !
Long call to mind, while gratitude mfpir^s,
The Man, who warin'd by Freedom'? sacred fireS,
The tranquil joys forfook of social life,
To wield the sword in fccnes of sanguine ftnfe!
His country's good, his firft, and only aim,
Undaunted, firm, in evety view the fame ! v
Nor (hall his mourning friends forget to tell*
Or on his gentler virtues tail to dwell.
Wit, Grace, Politeness, Dignity and Ease,
And all that in th' accdmplifh'd Man can please,
Infur'd applaule, and in the milder sphere
Of I'weet domertic bliss IHII made him dear!
The faithful Hulbandâ(now, alas ! no more !)
His weeping widow deeply shall deplore!
Th' indulgent Master many a work-worn (lave
With grateful tears his memory mall lave !
But ah! how vain each human power to charm
Mute now his Tongui âunnerv'd, alafc! his Arrti 1
Hufti'd are his lays, that once so sweetly flow'd,
On him the Muse her choicest gifts beftow'd,
His smallest praise, so high his fame was held
His lije alone, his tuneful strains excell'd !

On the PRESIDENT'S RECOVERY.
BEHOLD cooven'din mourrtful ftatc,
The virtues, long with blifc elate ;
Each brow a gloom Unusual wears,
Each heart opprefs'd with grief appears ;
" the general frievd> to pain a preyj
No longer charms each tear away,"
Said Libertys hung her head,
While fort-ow Toon the tidings spread '
Bencvohnee scarce check'd her tears,
Such asdefponding worth, reveres.
Cotwubtal Love, with anguish prefs'd*,
And Patrietifm fmotehis breast !
While gentle Pity heav'd a sigh,
And fearful rais'd th' imploring eye !
Patience strove t' appear serene, .
But anxious washer placid mien !
In gloomy mood, ftcrn JuJlice fate,
And {altitude in danger great
And Terriperance in nfanners mild,
With.GWrfy wept like a child !
When lo ! sweet Hope with joy illutn'd,
While round celestial radiance bJoom*d!
" From al!\ci grateful incenfc rife,
I come cotnmi/fion'd from the flues,
To yr Ur united piay'rs he's given,
Keitored to health by ftniling Heaven f
Who yet admits of this delay*
From bliss fupvrme, in realms of day;
Since his lov'd Country's dear success

Extract of a Tetter from Bojlon, Mjy 30.
" Unlcfs we can efteft a repeal of the exciiÂ»laws, or if Con
gress doort not interfere in our favor, wc shall experience as dull a
summer as ever we did during the contest with Britain.
" If the excise was equal throughout the union, we Ihould ac
quiesce in it most cheerfully.
" Yeftcrday Capt. Hodges arrived from Canton, by what I can
learn our East-India voyages will turn out bad this year."
The (hip Queen Charlotte, Capt. Caldwell, arrived here in 45
days from Bristol, on Thursday ; English papersby this veflel con
tain the following particulars. âThat the new Emperor of Germa
ny, Leopold lid. has demanded a categorical answer from the
court of Berlin, to certain queries refpefting the war with the
Turks, and the revolted provinces, a negative on the part of Pruf
fta isexpefled, in which cafe a war between Aujlria and PruJJia. is
inevitable. Leopold was to be crowned with great pomp and
magnificence tn May ; affairs in France wear a vCty precarious af
pefl, Paris in daily alarms, the abolition of the noblefle, clergy,
Sec. having reduced many to poverty.âThe Count Maillebois
had laid a plan to restore absolute monarchyâhis scheme was dis
covered to the National Assembly by his Secretary, in confcquence
of which the Count decamped to Breda ; the King of France has
sent a message to the national alfcmbly, couched in terms (imilac
to those in ufe'befoie the late commotions.
Paoli has fetout from England on his return to Corjica ; the
troubles in Brabant and Flanders continueâthe patriotic army
complains of, the inefficiency of their new Congrefs---and declare v
their intention of veiling Gen. Vavder Mersch with didatorial
authority. The States of Flanders on the other hand, have wrote
to those of Brabant to join in citing Vander Mersch before
them to answer certain charges against. him. The Empress of
Ruflia is entirely recovered from her late indispositionâand is
doing all in her power, personally, to fdrward opening the next
campaign. Antwerp is evacuated by the Auftrians; and 16000
of the Belgic troops have taken possession. The Britilh Parlia
ment was to be diflolved the middle of May ; Gen. Meadows is
| appointed Governor General of Bengal, in the room of Lord
Cornwallis Mr. Oakl y fdr Madrafs, and Mr. Seato.n for

B'vjhe Robin fkip'd wh â te CuDOts lai#,
Jn flfjUu! dumps, and fore afraid,
fxprfling n- yghi but bale ;
AiiiC, ' quoth Puck, and wav'd his wand,
" Arifc, and 'fore my mailer flanÃ,
" Arifc and tell thy tale."
Cuuben nethou?ht,hutÂ» I aftoond,

Ne knew he how, ne why ;
And how" cried angry Otsi
" Dar'ft Ihou our sports intrude upon,

"Thought Cuddp.n, surely if J fay,

Then Robin wav'd hit wnnd around,

" He's falfe, or else he wouldn't flick "
The X ' n Ã '"joy'rf the tritfi,

To all the cooit a merry fight.

Then Robin lorn'd the witchen glafj,
And made before his eep to pass

EASTON, May 2*.
Extracl of a letter from a gentleman in E"gland, to
hujrtend on this Jhore, dttted 2(ith February last.
Were one difpofedto wield the pen of con
troveriy, now is the time. We are inundated with
pamphlets from the hierarchy on one fide, and
rom the various fedls of diflenters on the other,
?' Ca^ in g advantage of the approaching diflb
lution of parliament, are attempting to frighten
the majority, who are against them, into a repeal
u, f . adls - 1 ain ' as Wilkes fays, of the ef
tablifted church; but as I am like him, without
any itrong prejudices in religious concerns, on
this occasion, I shall be perfectly inactive. 1 own
am inclined to favor the molt unlimited colera- |
Hon, though there are certainly very plausible
arguments to be made against it. You have had
the glory of giving the firft example of it to the
world; and 1 believe hitherto there has been no
re.i oj to suppose that even in point of policy you
have been wrong. The French, who, to thedef
ruction of their grand monarch, seemed to have
imbibed all your opinions, have adopted the fame
p anâand even nuns may now choose between
rcafon and fuperfhtion. They may, if they will,
neel in silence Â«nd solitude before an image in
the.r cloister; or if they like better, amori dare
