" Nature and truth are the fame every where, a>;-f
reason Jhtvis them every â¢where alike."
(Continuation of the arguments in support of the position, that the
universal dtffufion of literature will preccde and prepare the
way for the universal prevalence of religion.)
BUT when Â£n objeA of I'iicli novelty and im
portance as the Christian religion was pre
sented to minds enlarged by It tidy, and habitua
ted to an inveitigacion of knowledge, the power
even of a Roman Emperor, in repressing the en
quiries of enriofity, in checking subsequent con
viction, and restraining the progress of truth,
proved as trifling and impotent, as the ridiculous
attemps of Xerxes to chain the surges of the Hel
lespont.âAccordingly we find ttocearly after the
publication of chriltiauity, it by
all the civilized nations domi
nions, which were principally inhabitants of Ita
ly, Turkey in Europe, and some cities of anti
ent Greece in Alia. The nations inthe Northern
and Eastern parts of Enrope, for ages after this
lay buried in ignorance and idolatry. But in
those civilized countries, religion wil diffufed
with great rapidity and continued to flourish, as
little corrupted as was polfible in this imperfe<ft
Hate of human nature, till a division of empire
took place, and Byzantium became the residence
oft he Emperors. The virulent disputes and ani
mosities that rose from this divilion, as is ever
the cafe, corrupted the purity of religion ; and
almoftjat the fame inllant, the Northern nations,
rolling like a torrent upon the Weflern empire,
spread the veil of ignorance over learning and ci
â¢vilization.
Here then we may observe that 110 sooner had
literature vanilhed, than religion was forgotten,
or corrupted with all the idolatrous ceremonies
of pagan superstition. This points us to the ob
vious reason, why religion was sooner corrupted
in the Weft than in Ealh C'>nftantim>plc, like a
â vcterail oak, had weathered the rude inotks ul
the Northern barbarians and of the Saracens, for
several ajies after the Western empire had been
overwhelmed with their desolations. During
this period, that city continned the feat of litera
ture and religion ; while in the Weft,both were loft
in chaotic d.irknefs, or blended with errors and ab
surdities. Thus corrupted and degenerated, re
ligion was converted into an engine of state, and
was propagated wherever it became the interest
or inclination of Emperors and Bishops to extend
their jurifditftion.
To pursue this motleof reasoning, and to cor
roborate it by tadts, it may not be amiss to men
tion, that in the fifth century christianity was re
ceived in Germany and Ireland, in the iixth cen
tury it was introduced into France, and into the
kingdom of the Heptarchy in England ; Rullia
and Poland were con verted about the end of the
eighth century ; and Hungary in the firft year of
the eleventh. Sweden was converted in the ninth
century ; relapsed again into idolatry, and its
converlion was not completed till thecloi'e of the
tenth. But what was this religion which was de
nominated christian ? A fvllein fraught with eve
ry species of absurdity, calculated to astonish the
gazing croud, rather than to elighten their un
derstandings; to fetter the conscience and drain
the purse, rather than to check tiic vices and re
form the lives of its Itupid votaries. A religion,
in almolt every inftance,propagated by thefword,
by marriage or consanguinity; confined at firft to
the courts of the great, who embraced it from
motives of policy, and whole example was imi
tated by their devoted vaflals, cither through a
veneration for their pevfons, or a dread of their
vengeance. And mankind mull forever have
continued in this situation, groaning beneath the
enormous load of ecclesiastical oppreflions, had
not learning andcivilizntion firft paved the way
tor their deliverance. When the mind begins
to investigate the principles of a religion, those
ceremonies that have no foundation in reason,
and thole doctrines that are not consonant to truth,
will gradually lose their adherents. In this gene
ral ferment of examination, men may run into
extremes, and disown the rational and obligatory
parts of religion, because they find them blended
with creeds that are capricious and useless. But
as truth and nature are immutable, it may be pre
sumed that the intrinsic excellence of the chiilli
an religion, will eventually be recognized and
celebrated, by hicti who call themselves philoso
phers. "o be continued.)

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
FRIDAY, MAY 14, 1790.
DEBATE ON TONNAGE CONTINUED.
Mr. Madison's motion for a diicrimination, in the following
words under consideration. viz.
" r I "'HAT from and after the day of next the tonnage
JL of all such vessels be raised to , and from and after
the day of next, no such veflels be permitted to export
from the United States any manufactured article Che growth or pro
duce thereof."
Mr. Fitzfimons said he very much doubted the policy of adopt
ing this proposition ; he thought it an experiment of two bola a
complexion, con(jdering the recent eftabliihment of the govern
481
tffij&o
ment and the fituaiion of the commerce of this country ;
he thought we were not prepared to hazard the confcquenccs whi :h*
may result trom the operation of a system which would gÂ»ow out
ol so great a change in our commercial atfarrs.âlts prefciu opera
tion would only be to raise the price of imports.
Mr. Lawrance (aid that he was apprchenfive that the articles of
producc would lay upon our hands, if this measure fhou'd be a
dopted, which would be an injury to us. The calculations upon
theeffcÂ£l of its being a beneficial proceeding may be mi (taken cak
culations. The manufacture* of Great-Britain, and their manners
are in forae degree congenial to our own, and although we have
not all the privileges that could be yet we find our con
nexions increasing with that country. He was of opinion, there
fore, that the motion might prove disadvantageous ; neither could
he fee any immediate neceflity for its adoption.
Mr. Hartley observed that if the quellion was now put, he
should vote for the discrimination. It may be doubtful whe
ther the fir ft rate of tonnage, as reported by the fcle& committee,
is not too high ; but this may be corre&ed in the house. In pri
vate life, said he, the man who fliews himfelf my friend, I ftiould
affe&ionately legaid. The man who treats me with esteem, I
would wish to make a proper return to ; but the man who is vin
dictive, and drives to ruin iny intercftand my property, I would
endeavor to counteract or oppose by measures which might defeat
his purpose. The fame principles or conduÂ£l may, perhaps, be
fairly applied to nations. I can fay for tnyfelf, I feel no enmity
toward Great Britain, so long as Ihe treats this country with the
justice and refpeft due to a nation : but ftre fecms indire&iy, nay,
I might alinoft fay direttly by htr policy and regulations, to at
tack our ship-building, navigation and commerce, and wnhes to
injure our intcrells and our property.
We have a right to oppose her by counter regulations, or by a
system arhich inay induce her to examine the lubjed, to corre&her
errors and do us juftiee.
Pad injuries may be forgiven ; I will agree that those of the
war (hall be in dust. But when 1 agree that the injuries of one na
tion (hall be in dust, I must also observe, that our Iriendfliip for
another nation, who feived and relieved us in distress, (hauld be in
marble.
At the last ftflion it was said that Britain was disposed to do us
juftiee, and relax from fomeof the policy (he had pra&ifcd. We
were dc fired to wait, and all (hould be well : We waited, but at
this feflion we cannot 1 arn from any authentic documents that (he
has ftirrtd in the smallest degree.
Since the adoption of the New Constitution and formation of
this government, Great-Britain has experienced many advantages ;
(he has gained much by the fweeis of commerce. This govern
ment has (hewn the fulleft disposition to comply with the spirit
of the treaty. We have eftabhfhed tribunals of juftiee, in which
Britilh fubjtfts may recover fatisfa&ion for any demands they may
have against the individuals of these States ; without the smallest
danger of partiality or iijjuflice. What has (he done in return ?
She has been civil in some instances, for which we give her credit:
lor her friendthip or juftiee, we cannot fay (o much.
The attack ujkk. oui tommcrct has hern fpok.cn of before.
Why has (he not given up those posts ? She still retain# the ports
which by solemn treaty (he was bound to deliver up ; and to the
want of those posts may we ui a great measure impute the depre
dations and murders of the savages upon the inhabitants of the
western frontiers. Ido not fay that the Britilh countenance or
support those invaders ; but, were the posts in our hands, a great
check, might be given to such enormities.
It has been observed that we risque much by adopting the re
faction ; a commercial warfare might turn out ruinous to Am?-
rica. If our risque is great, that of Great-Britain will be greater j
(he has immense capitals in this trade ; we import many of her
luxuries ; we are chiefly cloathed in her manufaaures, and I think
it will be difficult, if not almost impoflible, for her merchants to
changs those capitals into other channels, which would be equal
ly produ&ive. I fay, as at present informed, 1 (hail vote for the
relolution.
Mr. Sedgwick said he was induced to believe this a measure of
very great impropriety, and one that would prove injurious to
the interest of the United States. He could not tell for what pur
pose, or what was the object of this discrimination. Who are
concerned in the carrying trade ? We are declaring aganift onr
country, in favor of another : for what purpose ? Do gentlemen
expect that France will aid our carrying trade ? He believed not.
It is a useless declaration, an impotent measure of paflion, said
Mr. Sedgwick, not dictated by the understanding; and fuppofini;
the elf eft intended Ihould not be produced, the confequenre
would probably be advantageous to Maffachufctts, but very in.
jurious to Georgia. 1
Mr. Smith (S. C.) thought it highly impolitic to enter into a
commercial warfare with GrcauÃritain. We ought not to con
demn her for following her usual policy in her navigation laws;
they arc not particularly aimed at us ; her navigation was oril
ginally aimed at the Dutch. We have not heard of anv alteration
particularly against this country, and therefore we have no room
for being displeased. Whenever (he finds her advantage, (he will
propose a commercial treaty, perhaps now, at the present time,
tt may be contemplating. The parliament rose in August Jaft ;
a new parliament may ast differently, and it will be more be.'
coming in us to wait for some little time, than precipitate this
measure This country has been so disjointed since the peace,
that we could not form any treaty with advantage ; And even now
this government is but little more than a year old.
With refpedt to the advantage Great-Britain reaps from her
trade with this country, which advantages (he will lose by the
adoption of this meafuie, we (hall also be injured. The effett
may be more alarming than is now apprehended, and may bric<r
about a revolution in one-year. *
Great-Britain is a more compact country, and has a more stable
and permanent administration ; but we change our administration
every two or three years : this gives them a decided advantage,
and they might cripple our commerce exceedingly from one Con
gress to another.
The gentleman from Virginia has said that we have it in our
power to starve the Weft-Imlits ; but bethought this an idea alto,
gether repugnant to the feelings of Americans ; they would pre.
fer a furrcptitious trade to such a principle.
Some articles I rom America pay no duty in England, wh'ch 1
pay duty from other countries ; we have, therefore, some indul
gences there which are not allowed us in f ranee.
Mr. Smith concluded by observing that we fliould not resent
the policy of Great-Britain's supporting her own navigation laws,
from which he read some passages, and then declared his opinion,
that if the proposition under consideration (honld be carried in the
house, it would prove very injurious to the interests of tlvs country.
Mr. Madison replied to the several arguments againfl his motion.
A gentleman said he (Mr. Sedgwick) had called it "ameafureof
padion." HÂ« observed thatjit had neither been ii&atcd by pas
[Whole NO. 121.]
I.ion, nÂ«r pjopoitfJ w ih pÂ«ul:o Â« . re :oi. -de- i il su cool, as
well as a pioper meai'ure, and believed, that the more coolly it
was examined, the more proper it would appear.' If any thing
was to be done, let it he lorn 'thing that will be effectual.
As to the tfiftinftion propoted between nations in treaty and
not in treaty* that point had been difrÂ« ( Ti*d and decided on yes
terday, .and wa* up part ot trie argument to day. It was agreed
on all hands, that rhemeafure reported by the committee was le
velled agaimt a part'icutai nation, .though it was not named. Why
t'ten oftertMoly nvo've other nations tor whom it was not intcud
ed ? And by muk.ng no difference in favor ot those m'treaty,
fearh otheis to consider a treaty with us as of no value? He
Lid we were the Jets leftraitied from making the diftinftion, be
oaufe the nation against which the measure was designed to ope
rare, had not hefuated to let the example, as far as her fuppofid
mtereftwent. He had, he said, before ihewn, thatthe principle on
\vhich the trade with the Weft-Indies was regulated by Great-
Jiritain, was a departure from the principle of her navigation ast :
accoidmn; to that ast, all other nations were allowed to carry di
reftlv their own produce in their own veiled, wherever the fame
trade was allowed by the ast to Bntirti v;ilels.
A genrifman from Pennfylvana (Mr. Fitzfimons) was afraid the
mrafure was too bold a one. But why, he asked, was it too bold,
if, as the weighty information andaiguments of the gentleman
himfelf had fh.-wn there was no danger ? if the existence of the
Weft-Indies, and the prosperity of Great-Bitain, depended so
materially on the trade with the United States, that it would be
madness in her to hazard an interruption of it ?
Mr. Madison then proceeded tore iew the European and Weft-
India commerce of the United States. He stated the imports to
f>e, from Europe, about 3,039,0001. sterling; from the Weft-In
dies 927,4381. âtotal, 3.966,438!. The exports to Europe,
3,202,448!. âto the Weft-Indies, 941,55 aj.â total, 4,144,000].
He (lated the export and return freight to Europe, to be esti
mated at 500,000!. sterling; to the Weft-Indies, 250,000!. âtotal,
750.000!. J-orthe return freight, which waseftimated at one
tenth ot the export freight, he deducted 45,45 jl. 10s. which left
lor the value ot the export freight to Europe 454.5451. 10s. By
applying a like rule to the Weft-India freight, he made the total
export freight to amount to 681,8181. ss. sterling; of this he
computed two thirds, or 454.5451.105. to be enjoyed by BrttifH
vrtfeis. He took not ce here, that the proportion of foreign to
Britilh tonnage, employed in the exports of Great-Britain, was
,ftatcd by I.ord as no more than one to twelve.
This amount of the freight, he said, at 21. sterling per ton, em
ploys 2 7,272 ton* of (hipping ; or, allowing two voyages a year,
568 veffelsofaoo tons burthen each.
Th's fhiopmg, he said, allowing Ax men to 100 tons, employs
6816 seamen ; or allowing one man to 15 tons, which was perhaps
a bettei eitnnate, seamen.
He aflced whether it was conceivable that Great-Britain would
give up all these advantages, rather than put the commerce of the
two countries on such a footing as would be reasonable and reci
procal ? Whether the would throw awav. and into rival hands too,
a height of near hall a million tlerling ? Whether lhe could bear
to fee between 5 and 600 vciTel# rotting in port, or fold to others
to be einyloyed intbs bifmefs iaciificed by her ? He asked what
would become of 7or Boco seamen. thus turned out of employ
ment ? And whether they would not enter into the ferviceof other
nations, and particularly of the United States, to be employed in
the exportation of our produce.
He took notice of the immense lot* that would be sustained by
the Btitifh merchants, on the capital employed in the American
trade, particularly the rice and tobacco. New 100,000 hhds. of
tobacco, not more than 10 or 12,000 of which was consumed in
Great-Britain, anqually went almost all through their hands.
The famething might be said of 100,000 barrels of rice annually
exported from the United States.
The msnufa&urers. he said, would be dill more distressed by
the want of the American market. Many articles, which were
luxuries to this country, and which it wqjjld be better without,
gave bread to that elafs of people. Their distresses would increase
the spirit of emigration, already fomuch dreaded by the policy of
that nation. He observed that Great-Britain would be the more
unwilling to rifle an interruption of her trade to the United States,
beeaufe it would hasten the efttblifhmerit of American mtnufac
fures, which (he always had endeavoured to prevent, and thereby
cut off for ever this important market for her's. He laid such a
danger would be particularly alarming, as her three great staple
fttanu failures, of leather, iron and wool, were thufe which were
making the greatest progress in this country, and would be moll
â  ided at her expence.
As to the British Weft-Indies, it had been fully (hewn, he
said, that thev could neither prosper nor subsist without the market
ot the United States ; they were fed from our granaries.âWith-
out our lumber, which it was admitted could be tupplied no where
e]fe, they could not carry on their trade orfupport their eftjblifh
nirms. In the sale of their rum, on which the profits of their la
bour ess ntially depended, they had no resource but in the con
sumption of this country. He said the whole amount of rum sent
to otnerXoreisjn countries did not exceed 8 or 900,000 gallons,
which was iÂ«oi more than one-fifth of what was imported into the
United States ; besides their loss in this refpes, thev would have
chc mortification to fee the vacancy in our market filled bv rum
made from molafles supplied by rival iHands. In cafe of war,
which happened: every ten or a dozen years, or a moment of fa
mine, which happened every three or four, he said the condition
ot the Bntifh lflands must evidently be such, that (he would not
fail to provide against the contingency,by proper concefllons, unless
lhe lhould infer from our conduct that they arr not neceflary.
He added, as a coofideration which he thought of great weight,
in favour of th? measure. that in cafe any negociations ftiould take
place, it would put our executive on proper ground. At present
the trade with Great-BritÂ«Â»in whs precisely in that situation which
herintereft required, and her King could moreover regulate it ac
cording to cir. umftances. On our part the executive could nei
ther otfer nor witdraw any thing. He could oiler nothing, be
caufc Great-Britain was already in poflcfljon of every commercial
privilege Hie desired. He could not lay, give us reciprocal privi
leges, or your's fhallbe withdrawn, becaule this mull be a legisla
tive act. By pafling the ast proposed, the executive will be ena
bled to speak a language proper for the occasion. He can fay, if
you do not give the United .States proper privileges, those given
to you shall not be continued. (To be continued.)

PARIS, March 2t
M. Neckcr's health seems to decline daily. His
hepatical choli.s denote that the liver is touched,
and he is altograher in a very critical ltate.
L O N DON, April 10.
The French National Gazette; a patriotic pa
per, printed at Paris) is prefaced with the tollow
ing principles :
1. Man is an independent, bei-ng by natureâ
and yet he has been every where the flaveot del
potifin, as soon as he has eltabliflied any thing like
regular society.
2. Several nations, after lhakingofFthe yoke of
afingle tyrant, have neverthelels soon found theii
condition no ocherwlfe altered, than by changing
one tyrant for many.
3. The eighteenth century feenis pregnant
with a revolution better combined, better direct
ed, and more universal than any preceding, anil
founded upon a more durable basis.
4. To establish the rights of mankind upon a
sure footing, it is neccflliry to go back to the o;1
gin of those mi Hakes, which have been the caule
of the loss of their liberty.
J. That mankind may not mistake a change
rom one species of slavery to another for liberty,
hey ought to be .acquainted with'the nature of
.he ancient ariftqeracies, which were nothing
more than the tyranny of the few over' ihe ma
ny, as also with that of the democracies, w.hich
by degenerating into mob governments, were
noching eife but the tyranny of the populace o
ver the persons arid properties of the wealthier
part of the citizen*.
6- That the friends and enemies of liberty
may know how to eltimate the success that may
be expedited trom their attempts to hasten or re
tard a revolution, it isnecetlary to convince both
of the truth of this proposition, that a long con
tinued state of opprefiion will finally awaken a
spirit of liberty ; and that every nation, consi
dered as an aggregate body, has its eyes always
open to the attempts of its enemies, as well as to
the faults and errors of its benefactors.
7. As we have reason to hope that the labors of
the National Alleinbly will be of advantage to
more than one generation, and that more than
one nation will follow our example, it is our opi
nion, that as good Frenchmen, it is our duty to
give a complete hillory of our revolution, in a
separate lheet, to be published once a week.
An adtion was brought at Leeds by a youn<Â» la
dy against a gentleman for a breach of promifeof

and was as follows :\" A's love is the fubliniel of
all passions, and has been the universal conqueror
of mankind, we are not ashamed to own its in

Extract from His Excdlettcy Gov.. Hancock's Spicch,
to both Houses of the Legijlature.
Â«XX TE have, by the blelfing of Divine Provi
\V dence, atchieved a situation truly envia
ble in the eyes of other nations : Our peri'ons
and pofleflions are governed by (landing and
known laws, and fecnred by a Conltiiution for
nied by ourselves. This Conltitution is a law to
the legiflaiive authority itfelfâandleaft the pride
of office, or the hand of lavvlefs power, should
rob the people of their constitutional security, a
proper ballance provided in the Judicial De
partment, occalionally arising from the body of
the people. The price of our freedom has been
great toil, and much expence, and we yet feel the
weight of it : But we teel as tree men, while the
people of some other countries are opprefled with
heavy burthens which have been accumulated, not
to secure, but to dellroy their freedom.
Though the national affairs of our country are
more immediately under the attention of the Ge
neral Government, yet we have very important
bulinefs which demands our attention.
Having formed our governments.and eftabliftied
our independency, we fit down quietly and peace- '
ably, to enquire into, and to perform thole du
ties, which may be reasonably expe(fled from us
in our tranquil situation. And lam very happy
to inform you, that the bulinefs of our meeting is
principally confined to the devising ways and
means for anfweringthe just demands of our pub
lic creditorsâmaking such additional laws as may
be necelfary to mark out the paths of distributive
justiceâto adopt such measures as may facilitate
the settlement of the uncultivated parts of the
Stateâand to devise ways for promoting ufeful
knowledge, and for inculcating those virtues
which are the only solid foundation of public and
private felicity.
Many of the citizens of this Commonwealth,
while the country was prefl'ed on every fide by
danger and distress, freely loaned their proper
ty to the public fafety : And had the most foleinn
aflurances for a re-payment with interest. Others
ventured their lives in the war for our defence,
and received the public faith pledged for 1 coin
penfation, when the war should be terminated.
The eyes of these creditors are now upon us for
justice : And the fufferings of the widow and or
phan demand our attention,
I am fenfiblethat some of the public fecuritles,
evidential of these loans and services, have been
thrown into the hands of persons who have given
but a small consideration for them ; but while we
are convinced that this has in some measure been
owing to the failure of governmental promises,
we onght not to increase the calamity, by unne
ceftary delavS in doing justice. Was it within
the power of the people to pay the debt they owe,
as a government, it would be for their honor and
advantage to do it immediatelyâbut as this can
not be done, the making provision for the punc
tual payment of the interest annually, will be
nearly as well for the creditors. But then in
order to produce this effeift, the payment of this
interest irntft be afTured upon funds which may
be depended upon. In a republican govei nment,
the idea of relponfibility is generally divided a
mongst too many persons to insure that punctual
ity in the performance of promises, which some
other forms of government may afford : There
fore the security of pun<ftual payments is jiot fre
quently well eftablillied, without appropriated
fundsâand yet the happiness of every govern
ment, in whatever form it may be, depends es
sentially upon the retftitnde and punctuality of
it. When 1 speak of the happiness of a govern
ment, 1 mean that situation of a civil community,
which has a tendency to make those who compose
it, happy, by affording them security against fo
reign invaders, at well as against internal com
motionsâand in defending the individuals over
whom it is extended, against oppression and in
justice.
The debt we are involved in, and which I have
low under conlideration, was contracted for the
omnion defence of the United State*, and I flat.
ermyfelf that justice will finally prevail, so that
:he government lately established will consider
[he whole of the Un ion as responsible to each State
for debts of this nature. In the report of the Se
cretary of the Treasury ofthe United States there
is a proposal for Congress to allume the debts of
thefeveral Statesâbut I am not convinced of the
propriety of the General Government's atl'uming
to pay the debts of this Commonwealth without
the requeftorconfent of this government âbut as
it will be more congenial to any (yftem of Finance
which the Congress may adopt, for this class of the
.creditors of this State, to transfer the demands
â to the General Government, on the idea of the
'Jtandinp- credit of our Government, and to have
them involved in the funded debt of the United
states, than to have a claim open in favor of the
Commonwealth, I recommend it to your feriotis (de
liberation, whether inftrutftions may not be given
to our Senators and Beprefentatives on thispoint.'
We hear that them is a profpctt of a happy union of sentiment
>n the Lrgiflature of Mafljf hufctts upon all great national fubjefb,

Mr. Fen.no,
NO! HING evinces more forcibly the high value of a federal
government, founded on the great democratic priticiple of
representation, than the conduct of the House of Reprcfentativts
ot the United States. Irs members extend their patemd earc
equally over every past of this gtfeat empireânothirtg escapes (heir
minute releaicheÂ« to wenefit every part of t+*c UnionâWhile mapy
regulations in the collection laws shew how attentive they have
been to avoid opjpreflion ; they have unifoimly manifelted au
ardent desire to accomodate all their eonftituerits, by aflxgning nu
merous ports and diftrifts for the convenience of commerceânay*
in foine inlbnces, this dilpofttion seems to have I d them almost
to Sacrifice that fccurity, which the due colle&ion of the revenue
requires. These obfervationsarccorroborated by a late tranfattion.
The committee recently appointed for the purpo/e of bringing
in a bill for extending the revenue laws of the United States, to the
State of Rhode-1 reported that foreign (hips, and all vessels
coming trom China or the Ealt Indies, should be lirrtitted to the
port of Newportâthe size ol that State would lead one to suppose
that one port was fully Sufficient for all its purposes of foreign
commerce ; but lurh was the desire of that body to extend the ad
vantages of commerce to all ports that were in a capacity of enjoy
ing and benefiting by them,that they added the port of Providence,
on the motion of Mr. Sedgwick, who afligned this reason, in favor
of it, that he h?d been informed by a worthy and intelligent gen
tleman trom that State, that it was the wish of foine of its inha
bitants.âWhat could juflify the foregoing remarks more fully ?

PROVIDENCE, which has placed one thing
over against another, in the moral as well as
physical world, has furprizingly accomodated
the qualities of men, to answer one another.
There is a remarkable disposition in mankind to
congratulate with others in their joys and prof
perity, more than to fynipathize with them in
their sorrows and advcrlity. We may appeal to
experience. There is less disposition to congra
tulation with genius, talents or virtues, than
there is with beauty, strength and elegance of
person ; and less with these, than with the gifts
of fortune and birth, wealth and fame. The ho
mage of the world is devoted to these lafl in a re
markable manner. Experience concurs with re
ligion in pronouncing, molt decisively, that this
world is not the region of virtue or happiness ;
both are here atfehool, and their (truggles with
ambition, avarice, and the desire of fame, appear
to be their discipline and exercise. The gifts of
fortune are more level to the capacities, and
more obvious to the notice of mankind in gene
ral : and congratulation with the happiness or
fancied happinels of others, is agreeable; iyin
pathy with their misery is disagreeable ; from
the former source we derive pleasure, from the
latter, pain. The sorrow of the company at a
funeral, may be more profitable to moral purpos
es, by fuggelting ufeful reflections,than the mirth
at a wedding; but it is not so vivid nor so sin
cere. The acclamations of the populace at an
ovation or triumph, at a coronation or inftallati
on,are fromthe heart, and their joy is unfeigned.
Their grief at a public execution is less violent
at least ; if their feelings at such fpetftacles were
very distressing, they would be less eager to at
tend them. What is the motive of that ardent
curiosity to fee fights and shows of exultation*?
the proceflions of princes ? the ostentation of
wealth ? the magnificence of equipage, retinue,
furniture, buildings and entertainment ? There
is no other answer to be given to these questions,
than the gaiety of heart, the joyous feelings of
congratulation with such appearance? of felicity.
And for the vindication of the ways ofGod to man,
and the perpetual consolation of the many who
are fpecftators, it is certainly true, that their 1
pleasure isalwaysas great, and commonly much
greater, than that of the few who are the a<stors.
National passions and habits areunweildy, un
â¢manageable and formidable things. The num
ber of persons in any country, who are known
even by name or reputation to all the inhabitants,
is, and ever mufi be very final!. Those, whose
characters have attracted the affeiftions, as well

as the attention of an whole people, ricquire an
influence and ascendancy that it is difficult to re
fill. In proportion as men rife higher in the
world, whether by election, descent or appoint
ment, and are cxpofed to the observation of great
er numbers of people, the effects of their own
passions, and of the affections of others for them
become more serious, interesting and dangerous.
In elective governments, where firlt magistrates
and senators are at Hated intervals to be chosen,
these, if there are no parties, become at every â 
frefli election, more kno>vn, considered and be
loved, by the whole jjation. But, if the nation
is divided into parties, those who vote for a man,
become the more attached to him for the oppofi
tion, that is made by his enemies. This national
attachment to an elective firft magistrate, where
thereis no competition, is very great : but where
there is a competition, the paflions of his party,
are inflamed by it, into a more ardent enthuliafm.
If there are two candidates, each at the head of a
parry, the nation becomes divided into two nati
ons, each of which is, in fact, a moral person, as
tuucli as any community can be so, and are soon,
bitterly enraged against each other.
It has been already said, that in proportion as
men rife higher in the world, and are exposed to
the observation of greater numbers, the effects of
these passions are more serious and alarming.
Impreifions on the feelings of the individual, are
deeper ; and larger portions of mankind become
interested in them. When you rife to the firft
ranks, and consider the firft men ; a nobility
who are known and respected at least, perhaps
habitually esteemed and beloved by a nation ;
princes and kings, 011 whom the eyes of all men
are fixed, and whose every motion is regarded,
the consequences of wounding their feelings are
dreadful, because the feelings of an whole nati
on, andfometimes of many nations, are wounded
at the fame time. If the smallest variation is
made in their Situation, relatively to each other j
if one who wasinferiour is raised to befuperiour,
unlets it be by fixed laws, whose evident policy
and necessity may take away disgrace, nothing
but war, carnage and vengeance, has ever been
the usual consequence of it. In the examples of
the houses Valois and Bourbon, Guise and Mont
morency, Guifeand Bourbon, and Guise and Va
lois, we have already seen very grave efFe<fts of
these feelings, and the history of an hundred
years which followed, is nothing but a detail of
other, and more tragical effects of similar causes.

Ex trad oj a Utter from Switzerland.
YOU are right in supposing that ariftoqracy ex
ists in Swiczerland : Nothing is morearifto
cratic than the government of fame Cantonsâbut,
nothing is more opposite, than what exists in Tome
others. There is not on entjre agreement be
tween the different forms of government which
we find in the country, known under the general
name of Switzerland : You find here nations the
most free of any upon the face of the earth, and
others equally despotic, governed as they were in
France, under Louis XIV. The French fugi
tives reside for the most part in the latter, and for
hospitality and conformity of sentiments, tliey
find here every body in unison with them, and
for my part 1 find myfelf almost alone. There is
among our refugees a rage, a rancor, and animo
sity which furpafles all beliefâand there is no
species of horrors and infamy, which they do not
daily utter against the Aflembly, Paris, and the
Nation. Agreeable to this every body here lives
in hope of another, and a contrary revolution
which they foment to the utmoitof their power.
