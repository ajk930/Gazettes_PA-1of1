" One might suppose that the Chrifiian religion
-would have been worn out, by faffing through so
many contending parties, unlcfs it had forte inherent
solidity to give it duration."
(Continuation of the arguments in fuppOTt of the position, that the
univeyfal diffufion ot literature will precede and prepare the
way for the nniverial prevalence of religion.)
THE fadts already mentioned may per
haps be deemed fufÃcienc to elVablifh
the point in queflion, as far as farts can do it.â
Thereare however other historical traces, equal-
Jy pertinent with those that have been cited,
to illustrate the main purpose of our argu
ment. It deserves to be noticed that about lixty
years before the glorious era of the reformation
in Europe, Constantinople, which had been the
relidence of learning and religion, was taken by
the Saracens, and the religion of JefusChrift was
swallowed up in that of Mahomet. By this con
quefl, great numbers of eminent doctors were
driven from Constantinople and other parts of the
East. These Doctors fettling in Germany and
Italy introduced the Grecian literature ; the study
of which soon occasioned a revival of knowledge
in almost every part of Europe. This happened
but a few years after the invention of the art of
printing;âa fortunate circumttance which great
ly accelerated a general difFufion of literature.
These preparatory events, concurring with other
causes of less extenlive and iefs visible influence,
rendered the publication of a rational theology
both practicable and natural. And for want of
thefecaufes only,itis obvious the efforts of Wick
cliff in the 14th, and of Hnfs and Jerome in the
1 jth century were less fuccefsful in refitting the
torrent of pontifical encroachments, than thole of
Luther and Zuinglius in the 16 th. But when
the human mind was once enlightened and ren
dered capable of dittinguifhing between the
precepts of religion and the impositions of fraud,

thaiPthe great, the amiable Alfred, or the pow
erful Charlemagne ; and a single voice from the
deflv was littened to with more attention than the
trumpet of Charles the Vth. Alfitled by these
favorable circumltances, Luther, before his death,
had the felicity of beholding millions of wretch
ed mortals emancipated from delation and flayery
- he saw one halt the huge fabric of ami chiilttan
dominion tumbled to the ground, and the otliei
half tottering to its foundation.
A candid furveyot these facts will convince lis
how fruitltfs an attempt mull: prove, to introduce
a rational fyltein of religion among lavages and
slaves, without paving the way by a cultivation of
the mental faculties. In addition to these let us
observe, that the inhabitants of the Highlands
in Scotland and the neighboringitlands, notwitli
ftandin" their vicinity tothe molt polished nations
on earth, and all attempts to detach them from
the idolatrous cuttoms of antiquity, ltill lemain
firmly wedded tothe druidical fuperltiiioti. Let
\is alio advert to the various efforts that have been
made, without success, to christianize the savages
upon our own frontiers. A reflection of a mo
ment will point us to the reafoii. Unlelsthe fava
gescan be crowded into so small a compalsol ter
ritory, as will compcl them to have recourle to
agriculture and commerce for a subsistence, they
never can be civilized; and all attempts to inltruc't
them in religion, while theyremain in the lavage
state, ever have, and probably ev:r prove as
idle and chimet ical, as an attempt to introduce
civil institutions among the lowls of Heaven.-
This leads lis to the real cause ot the otliei wife
aftonithing success of thejefuits in converting la
vages ; and of that de'cifive influence they have
acquired, wherever they have etlabliflied them
felvcs, particularly over the nations of Paraguay
in South America. The profound policy ot that
foclery ofingenious and learned men, has been
to prepare the way for a reception ot their reli
gion by a cultivation of the mind ; and by this
policy, and their indefatigable indu(try,the v have

DISCOURSES ON DAVILA. No. IX

'Tis from high lite, characters arc drawn,
A fairrt in crapc, is twicc a faint iu lawn.
TO any one who has never considered the
force ot national attention, consideration, and
congratulation, and the natuial and artifi
cial, by which they have been excited, it will be
curious toreadin Plato's Alcibiades, the manner
in which tliefe national attachments to their kings,
were created by the ancient Perlians. The poli
cy of the modern monarchies of Europe, ieemsto
be, anexadt imitation of that of the Persian court,
mr it is <xr>laivied by rhe Citccian philosopher.
In for example, thfe pregnancy of the
queen is announced with great solemnity to the
whole nation, her majesty is scarcely afflicted
with a pain, which is not formally communicat
ed to the public. To this embryo, the minds of
the whole nation are turned, and they follow linn,
day by day, in their thoughts tils he is born, the
whole people has a right to be crefent at his
birth ; and as many as the chamber will hold,
croud in, till the queen and prince are aim oft fuf
focated with the loyal curioiiry and affectionate
solicitude of their lubjects. In the cradle, the
principal peonages of the kingdom, as well as
all the foreign ambassadors, are from time to
time presented to theroyal infant ; to thousands
who press to fee him, he is daily shewn from the
nursery ; of every step in his education, and of
every gradation of his youthful growth, in body
and mind, the public is informed in the Gazettes ;
notaftrokeofwit, not a.Uprightly fully, not a
trait of generous affection, <an escape him, but
the world is told of it, and very often pi etty fic
tions are contrived, for the fame purpose, where
the truth will not fntiulh materials. Thus it be
comes the national fafhion, i; is the tone of the ci
ty and the court, to think and conveife daily
about the dauphin. When he accedes to the
throne, the fame attention is continued, till he
dies. In eletfive governments, fometliing very
like this always takes place, towards the firft cha
racter ; his person, countenance, character and
actions, are made the daily contemplation and
conversation of the whole people. Hence ariies
the danger of a division of this attentionâwhere
there are rivals for the firft place, the national
attention and pafllons are divided and thwart
each other ; the collision enkindles fires ; the
conflicting paflions interest all ranks ; they pio
duce flanders and libels firft, mobs and fed.tions
next, and civil war, with all her hilling Inakes,
burning torches and haggard horrors, at last.
This ifthe true reason, why all civilized free
nations have found by experience, the necelhty
of separating from the body of the people, and
even from the legiftature, the distribution ot ho
nors, and conferring it on the execuuve authonty
of government. When the emulation of all the
citizens looks up to one point, like the rays of a
circle from all parts of the circumference meet
inÂ« and uniting in the centre, you may hope for
uniformity, confiltency and subordination ; but
when they look up to different individuals or as
femblies, or councils, you may expetk ail the de
formities, excentricities ami confuhons, ot the
ptolemaic system.

HOUSE OF REPRESENTA V'VES.
Debates on Tonnace, ContinulD.
FRIDAY, MAY 14* I7?0,
MR. FrTZSIMONS obfttved, that notwithstanding all the
gentleman, (Mr. Madison) has said, he could noiTielp con
sidering thOmeafure as a very bold one. Great Britain maintains
her Well-India islands at an expence, which no other nation can
support : This iyftem flie mnft persevere m, at allrtfques and ha
zards, and (he will do it. The (hips of this country are not, and
will not for several years, be fuffic>ent to export the produce 01
the UriTfcd Su'e*, weexciud'- the Brit'ili (hipping, our pro
duce must remain ott our hands. This would be productive a
confluences which every one must contemplate with distress.
The (hips of Great Britain comprehend almost iniircly what in
called foreign {hipping ; by adopting this mcafurc we shall in et
fefl cut ott the Southern States from all opportunity of exporting
their produceâand as I think it mull be ? long period, it ever u
(hould arrive, before the Southern States will become manufactur
ers or (hip builders, it appears neceiTary that till such time as tht
American (hipping (hall be fufficient to carry off their produce,
that we (hould not exclude this navigation, cfpeciallv as the pre
sent capital of this country is not fufficient t lO furnifh a pieient
supply.-ââHe said, to encourage our own (hipping he thought the
enhanced duty on tonnage was prudent ; but beyond that could
not think himfelf judified in gding.
Mr. Williamfon stated some particulars refpe-aing the treaty of
peace, and said that a commercial treaty was on the point of beirijg
concluded at that time ; but the British nnnifter having received
informaiion that our ports were opened to her ihips, broke off the
negociation, as she enjoyed all that a treaty could givfÂ» without
binding herfelf.
Mr. Lawrance thought the information of the gentleman lad up
of the highell importance, and therefore wsfhed the business now
nnder confederation to be poAponcd until such time as this inform
ation could be more completely laid before the hou4e. We have
not yet, said he,-furnifhed the Prefidcnt with the means to fond
a person to Great-Britain to negotiate any treaty ; the till has
not yet paflcd the Senate empowering hull to nominate ambaf
fadort. &c. Hfc thought the fame arguments which had he en
ufe'd againlt the duty on tonnage might have been applied againd
laying a duty on rum, coffee orfugar. To prohibit British vessels
from exporting our pioduce,lic did not believe would bethought
so very di(advantageous lo them : they might find other employ
in exporting for ithcv countries, even from Ireland to the \\ 1 fl-
Indies. II we exclude their vefTcls, we exclude their capitals ;
and it is well known that a great many of the British. merchants
have their capitals invclted in the trade with America.
Mr. Lawrance further called on gentlemen to remember tint
this country had ttiany indulgences allowed her in Great-Britain,
which (he did not allow to other countries ; and indanced the ar
ticles of iron, flaxfeed, pot and pearl ashes, itc.
Mr. 9%; txd Lawjajicc his obfervat.on thAf
this was not a proper time to adoptrhc meafnre proposed, as he
was apprchenlive that if British bottoms were prohibited, oui
produce would be left upon our hands. He agreed with Mr-
Hartley,iu his obfbivations refpe&ing the western pods. *Ie view
ed the retention of thele pofls with indignity, as much as he view
ed the carrying tiade in any but our ownveffels ; but hfffaid time
was nrcelfary to bring ahout a proper regulation. Shall we go to
war with ourftlves ? laid he.
He said he fully approved the sentiments of the gentleman from
Virginia, yet such is the present situation of the United States, that
he lould not aiTcnt to adopting the proposition, as wc are by no
means prepared for the con/equenccs.
Mr. Page remarked that the whole ftttfs of the argument#
againlt the resolutions before the committee, dill reded on a sup
position that Britain would retaliate. He reminded the commit
tee of the different arguments which he and other members had.
adduced, to (hew the improbability of that supposition : and
remarked, those gentlemen who had agreed to raise the ton
nage on her (hips to one dollar, but refufed to do this unlets we
made our allies pay the like sum, exprefled fears very unoecoming
members of this house. Sir, said he, we are supposed to dread
what ia called a commercial war with Britain : how much more
will she not suppose we must dread a war of another denominati
on ? It we are thus timid, we shall (hudder at Britain s refeni
ment : if she fees this, Che (hould not only bold the pods she now
has within our territory, but (he (hould advance and augment
them ; (he (hould infill upon our faking off the duties which we
have laid on her commodities. These fears, added he, would
scarcely become us in our Â«ld colonial capacities ; they are high
ly unbecoming in our present independent situation, and are ex
tremely impolitic. But if some gentlemen are so much afraid of
difobhging the tnglilh, (hould they not have some fears lead thev
difobliÂ«re the French ? Is it wife to difgull that nation, and our
other <llics. and biing down at lead their contempt upon us, if
not a reilriflionofour commerce with them ? Can it be prudent
to make no diftinftion between the nation which views our rising
greatness with mortification, and which againd its mod obvious
interest redrains our commeice; and that nation which at this
moment is exulting in the enjoyment of liberty, for which they
gratefully acknowledge they are in a great measure indebted to
America, whom they had firft rescued from the tyranny of that
nation, to whom, contrary to the present intereds of their
own merchants, the\r open a beneficial commerce ? The French
mud he excecdingl) hurt by the observations which some gentle
men have made on our connection with France, and the prefer
ence they seem disposed to give to Britain.
But, fir, who can suppose that what are callcd indulgences of
Britain are any thing more than what her own intered evidently
diflates ? She increases her revenue nearly 700,0001. per ann. by
a duty on tobacco alone. The importance of the tobacco trade t<>
her was evident in the late war, when her merchants gave 2s 6d.
deil. per pound for it in this city, and afterwards paid isd. duty
in England. It was proved b7 Mr. Glover, when he appeared
at the bat of the House of' Commons in support of the merchants
petition anaind entering into the war wirh America, that one
third of the whole trade of Britain depended on t.ie thirteen
colonies, now the United States ; and it is certain that at
this although (he has loft much of that trade she en
joys a great proportion of it, and, a* my colleague clearly
proved, advantages result from it which (he has with no other na
tion. As to her turning her tiade into another channel, as has
been infmuated, (he must be a looser by it.
It is said that Britain gives us a generous preference to Ruflia ;
but the balance of trade with Ruflia, and every other country in
Europe, I believe, except, Portugal, is against her. _ .
But, fir, it is said that we may hurt the feelings of the Br mill,
who otherwise would conclude a treaty which they seem now du
pofed to make, now they have a power in America with whiÂ«J*
[Whole No. 122.]thy may treat. Thai power.fir, has existed above twelve month*,
and might have been long since applied to ; but I believe it never

ininiftei that nation ever had {Mr.'Pitt) proposed, as Toon at the
preliminary articles of peace were ligned, to put the trade with
America upon the Tame tooting oil which it stood before the war j
but his wife plan was rejected merely because the American States
seemed disposed to be as dependent in their commerce upon Bri
"tain, as when they were her colonies: and a bold experiment has
been made of the truth of Lord Sheffield's aOertion, that Ameri
ca cannot exill without the trade of Britain, and that even Mafla
chufetts woutd return to her toimcr fubje&ion to that country,
rather than be deprived of the carrying trade and filheries. Sir,
fin h affcriionsought toroufe an honell indignation, or at' least a
firm resolution to Ihew that they are groundless. I repeat it again
and again, that it is the wilhof Virginia to do this. I have been
alked why we not make a discrimination between our friends
and enemies ? Sir, I call not the Britiih enemies, they are ene
mies no more ; but I have been told by my countrymen, that so
long as they hold potts within out territories by an armed fbice",
they ought to be viewed as enemic* ; that so long at they restrain
our merchants fiora trading with them, and burn our vessels in
their poits, they cannot deserve the name of friends.
Mr. Bland was nearly of the fame opinion with Mr. Page, and
laid he could fee not the least reason to apprehend any danger of a
commercial warfare. He stated sundry arguments of the oppo-
Jera of the amendment, and read extrafti from thcit fpeechtt,
.Itibtthka proved to be perfeaiy contradi&ory to their present
ipope of reatoning, J|e further quoted fpme historical facts, ref
jieaiiig the conduct of Britain not long since, in regard of making
â¢ difciimiuation between the wines imported from Portugal and
thole imported from France. This was resented by the Portu
â¢ guele, who immediately prohibited the importation of Britiih
cloths, which had such an effefi, that Britain instantly entered
into a commercial treaty, and put Portugal wines on a better
tooting than the French wines, by giving them exclusive privili
ges. I would therefore ast, said Mr. Bland, is the trade of Por-,
tugal, that small country, ol more cbnfequence to Britain than the '
Vide of this continent ? I think not. Neither have I the least
apprchenflon that they will rift the loss of our commerce ; and
Inould they attempt it, wÂ« need sot give ourselves the trouble of

cluded, by obferviog, that the proposed amendment would bold

Tore that day arrives.

Apublifbed several refohitions of thecouncil and

The firft states that the partial abolition of the

the effert of this would be that the old people

cultom of that country be killed.
lid. That the loft of teamen in this business
has been proved on the tefliniony of Admiral
Edwards, to be much more inconsiderable than

the accounts ofthe siege of Carthagena ; the ex

the Havannah ; the returns of the) regiments that
came out under the command of General Garth
mi 779 and in 1780 ; and the expedition to Fort
it. Juan, on the Spanish Main.
X. That 'It is the opinion of the joint
Committee, that the charges which have been
brought ap-ainit the Planters of this island, ofim- ,
proper and inhumane treatment of our Slaves may
be Jully refuted anddifproved ; firftby an appeal I
to our laws, and secondly, by the evidence of re
fpeftable men who have resided amoag us, and
have been witnefles to our manners. Whatever
may be said of our ancient colonial Slave laws
the aifls which Lave been palled, within the last
rcn years, are written in characters ofjufKce
r.ieicy and liberality. Concerning the general
1 eatment ofour Slaves, we referto the evidence
already personally given to the Lords of the Coun
cil, by the Right Hon. Lord Rodney, Sir Peter
! arker.Admiral Barrington, Sir Joshua Rowley
Admiral Hotham, Vice-Admiral Edwards and
Sir George Young : and to the further evidence
that may be produced from genlemen ofcharadler
in f ngb.nd who have resided many years in this
island, and are intimately acquainted with our con
duift and manners. We conceive that the testi
mony of such persons is unanswerable and con
clufive ;and Ihall therefore only remark, that it
is notorious our Slaves in general are not only
treated withkindnels and humanity, but they art
alio protected by law from immoderate challife
ment or cruel treatment, and enjoy more easy,
comfortable, and happy lives, than multitudes of
the labourers in Great-Britain.
XII. That, It is the opinion of this joint
Committee, that the present value of property in
this illand maybe fairly and reasonably eliminated
as follows viz. 250,000 Negroes, at 501. Iterling
per head, is 12,500,000!. The patenreed lands,
with their erections, and the personal property
appertaining thereunto, at double the value oft he
Negroes, (being the belt general rule of valuati
on) amount to 25,000,000!. and the article of
houses In the towns, the coasting and trading
veflels, &c. may be estimated at one million and
an half at the least ; it appearing by the Report of
the Committee of the Lords of the Privy-Coun
cil, that the houses in Kingston andSpanilh-Town
are alone worth 1,428,52 il. Iterling. The total,
is thirty-nine millions of pounds llerling ; the
whole profits and produce of which capital, as al
so of the various branches of commerce to which
it gives rife, center in ($1 eat-Britain, and add to
the national wealth,-while the navigation necefla

What most he wilh'd to fee ;
on a costly bed was laid

?alcmon figh'd.and gaz'd and figh'd ;
When thus the Monarch blythly cricdâ
" Robin, full quick away !
â¢' Waste no more lime ; there's much to do,
" My little merry fpntc for vou

" <So find the traitors out; quick. ! fly !

Both warm and coltly too I trow,
By Fairy's magic pow'r.
Now in the midst, Pa lemon's (lore,

With gold and many a precious done,

Then Robin took up Cudden's ftorc,
44 Throw this upon the heap for more '
He said, and held it hi^h.
Cudden (who still as mouse had bcen >
Down looking on the varied scene)
Uttered a dismal cry.
Pdlrmon look'dâbut lo ! He found

With all his treafnre nigh :
Uwiwii's mansion full in view ;
The lovely maiden flill was true ;
l'altmon ceas'd to sigh.
The cock crew loudâthe Fairies fledâ
Down dropt dull Cudden on his headâ
Thick darkness fill'S the dome :
There wet and cold he trembling lay,
Until he saw the break of day,
Then sorry fought his home.
This story oft my grannum told,
When winter's .winds without blew cold,
To eager lift'ning yiuth :
My boy fays ftic, when you're a naan,
Upon this tale form ye life's plan - t

LONDON, April 6.
LETTERS from Conltantinople mention that
lufuf Paclist, who was Grand Vizir the cam
paign of'i 788,andfince,Serafkier oflfmael,is again
appointed Grand Vizir to succeed the old Captain
Pacha, who has resigned. ,
About thirty years ago, Charles Marsh and
honest To 111 Payne bought a parcel of books in
conjunction ; among which were a shabby lei or
Tillotfou's works. The executors, in a prayer
book which they preferred, found these memo
randums :âTil. 201. page BâTil. 601. page
12.âTil.âtool, page 200. â Ijl. 7Â°l- P a Â£ e
90." On the death of the good Bishop Ho'udley,
it was mentioned in the papers, that the Bilhop
was the editor of Tillotfon's works, 3 v ols. folio ;
it diredtly struck the executors that the treasure
was in the Tillotfon they had fold, lheyimme
diately applied to the booksellers, and reco\ered
the Tillotfon, and with it the notes. What is
extraordinary, the Tillotfon had travelled to
Oxford, and to a gentleman at the Charter Houle,
and was returned asa bad copy. Old Jerry Dy
fon, of the House ofConimons, old Ms. Plum tree,
who formerly lived in Jermyn street, and Bifliop
Burnet, used to lay up their Banknotes in books.
Lord Stanhope's project was never to make
way againlt wind and tide. Such a project,
every man who has been at sea, or conversed
with sailors, knows to be utterly impracticable.
But the application of a force which, in a dead
calm, shall be able to move a veflel, is undoubt
edly a discovery of a great importance. In natural
calms,fliips are inevitably retarded for many days;
when,if they were able to make way through a tri
fling (pace of sea, they would be certain of find
ing a breeze. And, in naval engagements, when
an artificial calm almost always takes place, and
vefl'els besides are often disabled in their rigging,
what a vast advantage tochange lituation, inltead
of lying immoveable upon the water, raked and
torn by every ship of the enemy that partes.

Extrafi of a letter from Perpignan, Feb. 19.
" A company of 120 men of the National
Guard formed, 011 Shrove-Tuefday, a kind of
proceilion that amused very much the inhabitants
of this town. At the head of it was seen waving
in the air a noble banner, on which was written
in large golden lettersâVive la Liberie ; every
one of the soldiers had wreaths of laurel and
flowers in his hands, and was singing, as they
inarched, a military song suitable to the cirenin
ftance. An uncovered waggon next followed
with emblems, garlands, and devices, of which
the 1110 ft confpicioos wereâ" Long live liberty,
the new Constitution, the Law, the King, the
National Aflembly, and the Patriotic Citizens
armed for the defence of the New Constitution,"
&c.âWine was procured from tliecartothe peo
ple ; on the hogfliead was writtenâlt only floit's
for real Patriots. A hundred National Volun
teers came next and preceded a second waggon,
on which were seen aitaved cask with the inferip
tionâThe Chefl oj privileges ; and a broken trunk,
with the wordsâThe Chofl of Feudal rights, addres
sed to the Princes of Germany. After this second
waggon, appeared a man, l'uperbly drefled, lean
ing on two chained Havesâhe was intended to
represent Aristocracy, and wore as an emblem a
mask with two facesâa numerous Court formed
his retinue; and when all the cavalcade arrived
at the moll frequented part of the town, they
were ordered t'Â» halt ; it was then proposed to
drinkto the health of our good King, Lewis XVI.
the Father of the people, and the restorer of
French liberty.
" Vivele Ro't was the general toast, followed
by shouts of joy, aud the flourifh of thirty mu
sicians ; during this effulion of genuine-mirth,
the man who reprelented Aristocracy was gnash
ing his teeth, and endeavouring to disturb thÂ«
augult ceremony. The second toast wasâVfoe
L' s/ffemblse Nationale, the found of which was so
hearty and loud, that it quite overpowered the
inad efforts of the enraged Aristocratic figure, who
foaming at the mouth, never ceased to cry outâ
No, no, 110! At the fame instant arrived a cabinet
courier, properly accoutred, who prefentcd a
packet to the commanderâit was the speech of
his Majesty to the National Assembly on the 4th
instant, and a letter supposed to be written by the
President to the good people of Rouftillon ; the
second in command read it, in a clear audible
voicc, and at every word of comfort for the peo
ple, thefigure changed colour, and at the words
âLet us all profefs, I give you the example of it,on
ly one opinion, only one intercjl, and only one will
an attachment to the Confutation, &c.âhe fell back
wards; some approached to raise him up and as
sist him, but thephyficians, after having examined
him andfelc his pulle, declared he was dead; to
keep up the mockery ofwoe,feveral perfonspre
fented tliemfelves in deep mourning, with weep
ers, &c. and followed the body, which was put on
a hearse, to the grave ; the moment that it dis
appeared, the commander in second proclaimed
that all our enemies were at an end, and ordered
a toast to be drank to peace and concord. The
music played an air suitable to so joyous a fubjetft.
Upvard of 10,000 persons were present.
