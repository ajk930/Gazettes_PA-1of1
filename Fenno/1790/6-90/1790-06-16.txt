which you will, are going out continually, ; and
without frefh recruits from the plebeians, the no

lowances for the ilate, which they are condemn
ed by themselves and the world to support, they
are poorer than the poar ; deeply jÂ» debt, and
tributary to usurious capitalists, as greedy as the
Jews. . The kings of Europe, in the fight of a
philosopher, are the greatest slaves upon earth ;
how often soever we may call them despots, ty
rants, and other rude names, in which our pride
and vanity takes a wonderful delight, they have
the least exercise of their inclinations, the lead
personal liberty, and the least free indulgence of
their passions of any men alive. Yet how rare
are the instances of reflations, and hew univer

a charm in it, which few minds can withstand.
The people consider the condition of the ereat in
all those delusive colours in which imagination
can paint and gild it, and reason can make little
lemlance, to this impetuous propensity. To bet

without limits, is the object of their constant de

Juries of the Eastern Circuit.
TX7HF.TH I.R any peoplecan long govern themselves in an e.
V quul uniform and orderly manner, is a question which the
a .vocates tor free governments judiy conlider as being exceedingly
important to the caufc of liberty. Tnis question, I.ke others
whose solution depends on sash can only be determined by ex'
perience : It ' S a question on wh.ch many think tome room for

apparent zeal for liberty, ..id the public good, enabled then. to
take advantage of the credulity and misplaced confidence of their
lellow-citizens.
Providence has been pleafcd to blcfs the people of this country,
with m-.re pcrfeft opportunities of choosing, and more effcau'al
means of eltablilhing their own government than joy other nation
has hitherto enjoyed ; and foriheufe we may make of these op
portun'ties, and of these means, we (hull be highly responsible to
i "f ov '""ice, as well as to mankind in general, and toour own
polleriiy in particular. Our deliberates and proceadines, being
unawed and uniiifluenced by power or corruption, domcftic en
loreign, are perfectly freeâour citizens arc generally and greatlv
enlighicned and our country is Co extenfiw, that the personal in-
Huenceo[popular individuals, Â«n rarely embrace large poitions
"'it ihe mltitution of general and State governmentsâtheir ref
pcctive conveniences, and defefls in pra&ice, and the subsequent"
alterations made in some ot them, have operated as ufeful experi
ments, and coiifpired to promote our advancement in this inter
filing science. It is pleating to observe, that the present national
government, already affords advantages, which the preceding one
k fO n C M iÂ°II ,ecb J c and l!l conftru &Â«i "Â» produce. How far it may
e (till d ftant from the degree of perfeaion to which it may pol
liDly be carried, time only can decide. It is a co.folation to re
lhat the Rood sense ot the people will be enabled, by ex
perience. to d.fcover and correct us imperfeflions, especially
while they continue to retain a proper confidence in themselves,
and avoid those jealou/ies and diillntions, -which, often (pringing-

moting good will and good temper, and the progress of ufcful

motives urge me further to observe, that a variety of local and
other ctrcumflarices, rendered the formation of the judicial dc
parrment, particclai ly difficult.

in this country ; from such therefore, no %ht of experience, nor
tHCiii.ies of usage and habit were to be derived. Our lurifpm.
deuce vaned in almost every State, and was accommodated to lo
cal, not genua! convenienceâto partial, not national policy
I his convenience and this policy, were neverthclefsto be regarded,
and tenderly treated. A judicial coutroul, general and final, waÂ»
â¢ lndifpenfableâthe manner of rfUliflang it, with powers neither
too extensive, nor too limited : rendering it properly independent
Â»nd yet properly amenable, involved questions of no little intrica
cy. The expediency of carrying justice as it were to every man'*
door, was obvious ; but how to do it 111 an expedient manner wa 4
tar from being apparent. To provide against discord between
national and State jiinfdiftion*, to render them auxiliary instead
ol no'file to each other ; ani (<> t<Â» connect both an to leave each
lulhciently independent, and yet fufficicntly combined, was, and

I he objeas of your enquiry are, all offences committed against
lie laws of the United States in this diftria, or on the high Teas
Â»V pet lons now in the diftria. You will lecollea that the laws
it nations make part of the laws of this, and of every other civil
ized nation. Theyconfiftof those rules for regulating theconduft
J n ' UlOn * towar ds each other, which, resulting from right reason.
receive their obligation from that principle, and from general as.
sent and prafiice. To this head also belong, those rul?s or laws
which by agreement become eltabliihed between particular nati.
nns, and of this kind are treaties, conventions, and the like com.
patts. Asm private life,a fair and legal contraa between two
men, cannot be annulled or altered by either, without the coqfent
nt the other, so neither can treaties between nations. States and
legiftatures may repeal their regulating flatutes, but ihey canqoc
repeal then bargains. Hence it is, that treaties fairly made and
concluded, are puieaiy obligatory, and ought to be punauallv
obierved. We are now a nation, and it equally becomes us ta
perfoi m our duties as to allert Our rights.
The penal statutes of the United States are few, and principally
relpect the revenue. The right orderingaud management of this
important business, is very eflcntial to the credit, charaaer and
prolpenty of our country. On the citizens at large, is placed the
burthen of providing for the public exigencies : Whoever there. '

It cannot be too ftronglv imprefled on the minds of us all, how
greatly our individual prosperity depends on our national proipo

organized, vigorous government, ruling by wife and equal laws,
faithfully executed, nor is such a government unfriendly to liber

nothing but a strong government of laws,irrtlillably bearing down
arbitrary power andlicentioufnefs, can defend it agaiuft those two
formidable enemies. Let it be remembered, thaf civ liberty con

THE TABLET. No. CXXIII.
'< The belt institutions may appear imperfect,
-while the people are so, among whom they are
established."
, (Continuation and conclujion of the arguments infupport of the petition,
that the universal dijfujion of literature nujt precede and-prepare the way
Jor the universal prevalence of religion.)
THERE may bÂ« *n objeflion brought agaioft tfie princi
ples of thii difcuflion. It may be suggested, and lam
-willing to concede to the truth of it, tbatin nauoni arrived to the
greatest degree of refinrnÂ»ent in learning, every fpeciti of vict
and immorality his been carried to the grnteft degree of exceft.
To obviate this objrQion it must be confidcred, that these vices
proceed from eauici lotaUy alien from litenry improvements.
The corruption of learning,Â«f manner sand religion, are a neceflary
stage in the progress of nations, and inseparable from humanity.
Xiterary improvements flourifh moll in the period immediately
subsequent to the civilization of a kingdom, and their declension
always precedesitsdeftruQioor These stages are elTential to every
thing capable of progreflion. In the vegetable world we fee
plants spring from the earth, grow to muturity, and decay. Our
bodiesexhibit the tendernefa of infancy, the vigor of manhood
then the feeblenefs and deformity of age. Our intelleaual facul
ties pass through stages precisely corresponding to those of the bo
dy ; and we may as well impute the decays of old age to the en
largement of our intellectual jwweis, as to ascribe national decays
of religion to improvements in literature. These stages are in a
peculiar manner incident to nations. And as the growth of the
body must, in some measure, precede the improvement of the
mind ; so the introduftionof literature into a nation must, in fame
measure, precede the reception of religion. Then both flourifh
in their purity and are corrupted together. Literature, like the
body, ceafesto exist; religion like the intelleaual faculties is ex
tended to immortality. The obie&ion therefore amounts to no
more than this : that it is impofiible to give a perse& religion to
imperfect cteatures; that is, one fjiflicient, without miraculous in
terposition, to restrain their vicious Inclinations j or to express it
in other words,that it isimpoflible to give perfe&ion to the mor
al character of a race of beings, who are imperfect in all other ref
pefls.
. When therefore we reflcft that religion is cultivated most in a
{late of mediDcritv, equally removed from opulence and indi
gence, every rational mind must be convinced not only of the fu
tility of the objection just mentioned, but that religion, as well as
civil liberty, flourifhes best in a land of knowledge.
This enumeration of historical fafls, and the Ibfervations we
have made, may be comprised in the following concise deduflions,
âThat mankind in the savage state are incapable of entertaining
any just notions of an infinite invisible Deity, or of understanding
the fundamental principles of ciiriftianity; ihatof couife it is na
turally impofljble they ftfoold believe r Â«uklllefs praÂ£ttfe its pre
<epts ; that this difpenfatien was firft publirtiei and propagated'
among the most learned nations on earth, the Greeks and Romans;
thai wherever it has been preached among faipges, it has been
immediately buried in ignorance, or blended with idolatry ; that
wherever it has been established, it has been preceded by the in
troduction of literature or fuppotted and promoted by progres
sive civilization ; that at present it exists only in nations whrrfc
learning is more or lefsencouraged ; that a corruption of liteiature,
of mannersand of religion are elTcptial to humanity and infepara
bie companions. From these principles, which wefind establish
ed by the invariable experience of the whole human race, we con
clude with all poflible certainty, that so glorious an event as the
vniverjal prevalence of religion mvjl be preceded by the universal diffu
literature.

can accommodate Courts,but Exeter He w.lhed therefore that the
House would adhere to the original arrangement.
Mr. Thatcher hoped the House would not agree to the report ol
> ioint committer, but would intift on then amendment It
f emed to*be a party matter between the towns ot Portsmouth and
Exeter, and the former only has bren heard before tins house.
So ne gentlemen from Portsmouth have com. forward and prayed
Congress to grant them a particular privilege, to the injury ot
Ex- ter The feting of Courts in a place is efleemed bv the inhab
itants thereof, a confiderablc privilege ; but Exeter has not yet
been heardâHe therefore hoped this House would not agret to
remove the Courts from Exeter to Portsmouth, till time enough
has elapsed for the gentlemen in Exeter to come forward arid itate
their reasons why the Courts should be continued as they now are.
And this undoubtedly would be done by next session of Congress.
N.Â» iniuftice can accrue to Port (mouth til I that time. There will
not be more than one or two sessions of the Court before C ngrefs
meets again. He could nociielp observing, that the Senate, in this
cj'.c, had not aaed with their ufua) {lability, but seem to have at-
I tempted to change the place of holding the Courts in Hampfhue
without due consideration. They have attended to the pi aver ot
the gentlemen from PoTtlmouth, and have not given the gentlemen
of Exeter an opportunity of lhewing why that prayer ought not to
he granted It is a fact that Portsmouth and Exeter are, in some
refpefts, rivalsâand this House ought not to favor one to the injury
of the other. Portsmouth has many natural advantages for carrv
ing on frade and commerce, while Exeter labors under every in
c ivenu nce, and therefore Congress will do well to extend to her
everything that may promote and cncouia je her trade. ihe gen
tleman firlt up from N. Hampftme, ( Mr. l.iveimoi cf) 'ays, that he
has been informed there is not more than 3 or 4 lect of water
t> Exeter; but another gentleman, from tint State, ''Mr. Gil
mau,) who has lived many years in Exeter, and been engaged in
Commerce there, declares the 1 c is a depth ot water ol 8 or 10 feet
leading to that town. It is to b pre fumed the latter <*-ntlcin>n
is best acquainted with this fact, I therefore lh.ill take it tor grant
ed the depth of water greater than has been repref u:<d
by those who advocate rem >val ot the Court.
It has been said the nitUiooevs are refpeÂ£table fherchants in
PortsmouthâHe doubted not but maoy ot them were very refpcc
table merchantsâbut hexiad rc.it >n to believe tome of them were
not in the mercantile linoâlt '.s laid the mat itime courts were ne
ver he'd Exeter ; but during the war were established, by the Le
gifl.iture of that ftatc, at Portsmouthâthe reason was because the
maritime courts were then erected folcly for the purpose of trying
capturesâand at that time there was but little, or no commerce
carricd on at Exeter, which if he had been rightly informed, is
not the cafe now. It the law tor ettablifhing the courts be
infpc&ed, it will apocar, that in several in(lances,thev are appoint
ed to be held at phces where they were never held betore ; he be
lieved that was thf cafe in th<- diftrift of Maineâthe courtis now
held twice a year for that didrift, at Wifcafiett, which begins to
be a flourifhing place, though but a few years ago there might be
no commerce there. This he took to be the cafe with Exeter.
It has been said the Gentlemen at Portsmouth are willing the
circuit court (hould be held alternately at Portsmouth and Exettr,
and he conceived there was the fame reason why the diftri& couit
(hould be held at Exeter also. He thought this reason would be
much stronger when the excise laws were contemplated as a source
ot judicial buGnefs.
He sard he had one observation to make on the method the Se
nate had taken to effeÂ£l the removal of the court'from Exeter. A
clause is tucked in at the very close of a bill for eflablifhing the
judicial courts in the state of North Carolinaâlt is of great impor
tance to have the courts eftablifhcd, as soon as pofTiblr, in thit
State, and withou doubt the Senate presumed the House, under
this impreflion, would consent to the clause refpefting Exeter, ra
ther than retard the pafling of the more essential parts of the law.
But he hoped the House would perfitl in their original amendment,
and if at the net feflion it thould appear necellary to remove the
court from Exeter to Portsmouth, it will then be time enough to
do it, and a law may pass for that purpose.
Mr. Sedgwick said that some obfervationshad been thrown out
against the Senate, which he did not conceive their conduct me
rited ; and from the known canddr of the gentlemen who had
used them, he did not doubt that on mature retlcftmn they would
confidcrthcm in the fame light that JTe did. The fubjett now be
fore the House has been canvallcd by acomnfittee from both Houf.
es ; every member of whÂ£ch except one, was in favour of the re
port which had been ma<)e âthey arc gentlemen of undoubted in
tegrityâthey had the fulK.lt opportunity of investigating the fub
jeft, a much better opportunity than (tie House can poflibly haveâ
and if the reports of such committees are not to be a rule to the
House, their utility is deltroyed. He had foimerlv been in favor
of the court's being held at Exeter, as a majority of the members
j from that State had represented it as eligible , but fincc t has be
come a fubjeft ofdilpute, and the matter has been carried to such
lengths, and the result has been the repoitnow read, he was in fa
vour of receding.
Mr. Foster observed that the Gentleman from MafTachufctts was
mistaken, as there were two members of that committee against it
âhe added some observations which we did not hear.
The queflion for receding being put, was loftâand the house
v oted to adhere to their amendment.
MONDAY, JUNE 14, 1790.
The Committee to whom was re committed the
bill for the relief of Nathaniel Twining, report
ed an amendment to said bill, which was, to flrike
out the firft clause. The bill as it nowitands,
provides only for a remiflioi} of the penalties in
curred by said Twining for failures in his con
tra<sl for transporting the mail The amend
490
ment re ported was agreed to, and the bill ordered
to be engrofled for a third reading.
In Committee of the whole oh the bill for re
pealing, after the lalt day of the duties
heretofore laid on spirits of foreign manufacture,
and laying others in their (lead.
Mr. Seney in the Chair.
The Committee proceeded in the difcullioii of
the bill, andfinifliedit.âThey then rose, and the
Chairman reported the fame to the Houl'e, â with
sundry amendments.
Mr. Sedgwick madefoine objections to entering
into a consideration of the amendments proposed
to this bill.âHe vvifhed that the question of as
sumption iliould be firlt decided upon.
Mr. Sherman was in favor of fiuilhing die bill
at this timeâHe wilhed and expected that the
aflumption would be taken up,'before the dole of
thefellion âandfaid, it may be made the fubjed
of a separate bill.
Mr. Bloodworth offered several objections to the
bill. .â. .
Mr. Madison was in favor of fimfluug it.
Mr. Kitzfuuons observed, that the gentlemen
who are for delaying the pafljge of this bill, do
not explicitly object td the mode pointed out fur
1 ailing the additional revenueâThey donotfay,
that if this plan is rejetfied, they will agree to sub.
ftituting other objects of revenueâso that those
who are in favor of providing the Ways and Means
to carvy into e(Fe<ft the funding system, are em
barralfed how to proceed.âlf the gentlemen vill
be explicitâand declare that if the proposed du
ties are not taken by the general government,
they will point out, and agree toothers, we (hall
know wliatto doâbut at present, it is utterly im
poflible to determine, from their mode of proce
dure, what their objecft is.
Mr. Sedgwick replied to Mr.Fitzfimons. He said
for his own part, he had always aimed to be open
and explicit on this fubjedtâ and that he was now
ready to declare, that on the principle of not af
funiing the State Debts, the duties contemplated
by the bill would be impolitic and unjnllâtliey
will operate in a molt inauspicious manner, both
with refpetft to the creditors of the States, the tran
quility of the State Governments, and the peace
and honor of the peneral government âThis liad
been he said the invariable tenor of his obierva
tionson this fubjetfl, from the firft to thelaft.
Mr. Si one read a statement which he h?d pre
pared, containing several duties on Imports and
Tonnage, in addition to those already laidâand
some new onesâwhich he supposed might befub
ftitnted, in lieu of the Excise proposed in the bill,
to which he was oppofied.
Mr. (Jerry was oppoftd to proceeding in the
consideration of the billâHe wilhed it
for a few days, till the House could poflefsthem.
fclves of the opinion of the Senateâwhom, he had
been informed, now had the fubje<ftof aflumption
under consideration.
Mr. Fitzfimons replied to Mr. Gerry. He tho t
it a very extraordinary propofit ion, tnat the house
(hould wait for the determination of the Senate
upon any fubjet r t, more especially a question of
this kindâbesides he very much doubted the l ight
of the Senate to originate any thing on the busi
ness ofthe aflumptionâbut we arc not to decide
hastily, said he,becaufe a majority may determine
differently froni what some gentlemen appear tÂ»
wiih should take place !
I would ask, said he, how this legislature is ever
to go on with the important business before tlieni,
except they are to abide by the decilion ot the
majority. Some gentlemen appear to be opposed
to the principle ofthe billâothers are oppoie't
to all duties except the State debts are aliened.
Let us reflect 011 our situation, provided no pa
vilion is to be made for the doineftic debt ot the
United States. He hoped the consideration 0
the bill would be delayed no longer.
Mr. Gerry replied to Mr. Fitzfimons ; he con
tended that the Senate had a right to originate
the business of the aflumption, and that it hat
been customary for that house to wait for theue-
of the Senate, when they had been inform
ed that they were on a fubjeel which the hou e
had contemplated taking up; he declared t iat
no man realized more than he did, the nnpor
tanceof funding the public debtsâbut then e
wilhed the system to be commensurate to the 0
jed:âto be impartial, liberal, and just.
On the question to take up the report 0 t
Committee, Mr. Vining moved for the Ayes an

pofed-and agreed to the fame-Other amend-
which imposes a duty on stills was
obiefted to by several gentlemen, and after some
on thefubjedt, it was agreed that the
Bill should lie on the table.
Mr Fitzlimons laid the following refolutionon
the table, viz. " Resolved, that from and after
Â« the last day of next, the dunes hereto

" that the following be laid in their stead, viz.

" C offee, 5 Cents."
In committee of the whole on the Bill for ef
tablilhing the Post Office and Poll Roads.
Mr. Boudinot in the Chair.
The committee made lome progress in the dif
cuflion of this billâbut not having time to finilh
it, asked leave to fit again
A meflage was received from the Senate, miot m
ing the House that they have palftd the act for
extending the Judicial Law of the United States
u.t he State ol Rhode Island, with one amendment,
-which was to reduce the firiary of the Diltrift
Judge from one thousand, to eight hundred dol
lars. This amendment was agreed to.
A meflage was received from the President, in
forming that he had approved and signed an Act
for extending sundry acTis therein mentioned, to
the State of Rhode Islandâan aÂ£l for the relief of
Thomas Jenkins and companyâand also a rel'o
lution so. annexing to the code of laws, the sever
al treaties now mack, and that may be made be
tween the United States and foreigu nations.
TUKSDAY, JUNE 15-
The bill for the relief of Nathaniel Twining,
having been engrofled was read the third time
and palled.
In committee of the whole on the bill to elta
blHh the poll office and post roads in the United
States. Mr. Boudinot in the chair.
The fedtion which prohibits paflengers from
carrying letters, under a penalty of three times
the postage, was objerted to, as impracticable in
itfelfâit was moved that it should be expunged.
Mr. Livermore, who was one of the committee,
observed that this feftion was introduced to pre
vent the diminution of the revenue from the poft
officeâthe mail is now carried in llage coaches,
in which there arc generally jeveral paflengers,
fometimesas many as fix, and it is supposed that
many more letters go by the paflengers, than by
the mail ; it is to be supposed that moll persons
would wifti to be excused from the trouble of car
rying theCe fetters, and if tkis lection passes, they
will be furnifhed with an excuse for not taking
tliem ; and it appears very unreasonable and ab
surd that the public should pay the proprietors of
/he stages for transporting the mail, and in this
way be^defrauded out of that revenue which they
are undoubtedly ejititled to receive.
Mr. White and Mr. Gerry were in favour of
flrikingout the clause. Mr. Sedgwick and Mr.
Sherman in favor of it as in the bill.
The motion for striking out was negatived.
The committee proceeded as far as the 21ft
fe&ion and then rose.
Mr. Lawrance of the committee appointed for
the purpose brought in a bill authorising and
empowering the 1 reiident of the United States,
to pmchafc such a part of the tract of land at
Weft-Point, as the public service may render ne
ceflaryâread the firit time. Adjourned.

as many stars ; and on each fide were displayed
the ftaridards of the Company, and of the Artille

' PHE rnncedeCont; having returned to Paris
-I will induce several others of the French
fugitive Princes to follow his example. Theab
fence of many of the French Nobility from their
own country, is one cause of the great scarcity of
ready money.
In the ]alt letter from the King of Prnffia to the
Bishop of Liege, his Majesty fays, that if the Prince
does not accede to his propofuions, heMhall with
draw his forces from Liege, which he is well af
iured will produce a civil war.
1 he new King of Hungary brings with him to
Germany, what was much wanted in the lad
months of his brother's reign,.a great supply of
money. I c is said that his Majesty, whiKt Grand
Duke ofTufcany, was able to lav byannuallyfo
contiderable a sum of money, that he found bim
lelf, on the day of his brother's death, pofleUed of
a capital of eighty millions of florins.
I he states of flanders and Hatmati, have both
declared themselves strongly in favor of returning
to the allegiance of the new King of Hungary, on
the terms proposed by his Majesty. Every pru
oent citizen would w:fli to do the iame, for it is
inipoiliblenow to miltake the motives and actions
o' the clergy of Brabant, whole foleview is to ag
grandize themselves at the facrifice ofthe country
at large. J
Very few of the fugitive Noblefle of France,
i endent in this country, can procure remittances
trom home, and the lituations offeveral are in
consequence diftrefsful in the extreme ! The
Duke ofLuxembourg is to be reckoned among the
unfortunate, as though he was left without a re
source, he has found|a friend from whom he ex
periences an ample lupport. He had conciliated
the friendfhip of the Duke of Marlborough by
hispolitenefs/hewn to the latter when in Paris,
and his Grace has, in return, given him permissi
on to draw on his Banker without reftrit r tion.
This instance of munificence does honour to the
country.
Among the foremoit ofthe lafe Emperor's good
qualities, was that of attending to applications
w hen from the meanest of his fubje<fts ; and it is
to the honor of his memory that in no instance
â¢where rcdrefs of grievance was demanded in juf
t*ce or equity, it was ever refufed. His firft'bu
finefs every day was to read over and investigate
ail petitions and memorials, and to give orders
accordingly.
By recent accounts from China, we l#arn that
every part of that vast empire is defaced and
torn by civil diflenfions, which rage with the molt
ungovernable fury ; the fame accounts also des
cribe, in the moll pathetic terms a mortality oc
casioned by famine through inoftof the province;
particularly in that of Canton, where the mise
ries of the people are indescribable.
Such were the calamities occasioned by famine
in the province ot Canton, that contrary to the
jealous fpiric of the people, the Engliih then at
that port were invited into the town, and per
mitted to explore the adjacent country, that they
might behold, and report to the British I'ettle
ments, the diltreiles which reigned there ; but
unfortunately for their own preservation, the
settlements were compelled to deny them that
relief which at any other time humanity would
afford and dictate.
T.ie inhabitants the river, who are
prodigioully numerous, felr much less the effÂ«<fts
or this famine, than tliofe in the country, the
.ormsr having a supply of fifli, of which necefli
ty obliged them to refufe the participation with
their unhappy countrymen.
So sacred is the liberty of the Press confulered
by the French National Aifembly, that they will
overlook even libels upon themselves and their
j*oeeedings, rather than attempt to check the
freedom of wriring and of priming.
Declaration of the Sovereign Congress of the United
Provinces of Flanders.
Dated Br.ujfili, April 7.
The said Congress being informedthat a report
is (pread abroad, that regulations are about to
take place with foreign powers, contrary to the
rights and liberties of the Republic and United
Provinces, positively declare that no engagement
whatsoever has been entered into with any fo
reign power, neither do they mean to enter into
nny which can in theTeaft afFeOl the liberty, in
dependence, or commerce of the Republic in ge
neral, nor any particular province! The Con
gress exhort, therefore, every individual, to be
cautious of giving credit to every insinuation of
the kind, which can proceed only from evil-mind
ed people, with a view to check the ardour of
patnotifm among the peopleâto foment divifi
011s, and to check the confidence of the nation
placed in their representatives.
Given in Congress, April 6th, 1790.

PHILADELPHIA, June 10.
As the derivation of the term Merry A/idrtwis
not generally known, it may not be amiss tp men
tion, that it arose from one Andrew Borde, a droll
physician, who used to attend market towns, and
liarrangue the populace in a facetious manner.
He was in great repute, and much followed in the
year 1574.
BURLINGTON, June j.
A correspondent begs leave to suggest to the
farmers of New Jerl'ey, the great advantages
that would flow from (hearing their early lambs.
The custom is generally adopted in England,
and furnifhes a valuable materiaHn the impor
tant manufacture of woolen hats. The ui'ual
time for (hearing lambs is about five or fix weeks
after that of llieep /hearing ; this will allow
fufficient time for the fleeces of the lambi to
grow before winter ; and instead of injuring,
rather promotes the grovfth of the wool. Many
judicious farmers in this country have tried the
experiment with fuccels, and found the averaged
quantity ot wool obtained by these means, to be
a pound and a quarter from each lamb.
BOSTON, JUNK y.
Mr. Si'eliexd, for many years Quarter-Mas.
ter in the i6th,or (Queen's) Regiment of Ligln-
Dragoong, known by the nameofÃurgoyne's,and
who wn captured with that General and Lord
Cornwallis, in this country, has lately arrived in
this town, from Gibraltar ; and is an instance of
the good effects that the exercise of walking has
upon the health. This gentleman is considered
as one of thefirft walkers in Europeâhe has late
ly walked through every county in England and
Ireland, through France, Italy, Spain, Portugal,
and a great part of the Barbary Hates, particu
larly from Tangiers to Meqinez and Fez, in
Motocco, and through the Arab's country he
has also walked above 790 miles since his arrival
in AmericaâWhat most remarkable is, that se
vere snow storms never deter him from fettiii"
upon a journey on foot, from which he seldom
ieels the inialleft inconvenience.
