FOR THE GAZETTE OF THE UNITED STATES.
On the MEANS of PRESERVING the UNION of
the AMERICAN STATES.
THE present Constitution of the United States
appears to be excellent in contemplation ;
and if the harmony of the States ftiould not be
disturbed by groundless jealoulies, it bids fair to
bedurableand efficient in pra<ftice. It ishowever
â very doubtful whether several jurisdi&ions with
in a jurisdiction, wheels within a wheel, will not
produce fonie jarring in their movements. The
experiment is curious, and much wisdom and
pt udence may render it fuccefsful.
What then are the probable means of perpe
tuating our present eltablifhments ? Patriotism
and the (wont are not the means. I conceive
the means to confilt folelyin a union ofinterejls
I.âAll debts contracted during the late war,
and in the common cause, mult be made a common
charge against the Union, and the creditors must
all look to the fame authority for payment, must
de >end on the fame rej'ources ,and have the offer of
equal compensation. Divide the debts, divide the
resources, leave the different State legillatures to
make various unequal provisions for payment, and
a hostility will immediately commence between
the gene 1 aland particular governments, and be
tween the different descriptions of creditors.â
To fever our Union forever, nothing is wantod,
kut to set three or four States contending with
Congress about the sources of revenue ; and un
lets the debts ftiould be affumedand made a com
mon charge, nothing but infinite power could
prevent fach a contention.
II There ftiould be no exclusion of persons
â who hold feats in the national government from
a capacity to hold, at the fame time, offices under
the state governments. However diflinH the pow
ers of the governments may be, their inttreJls are
â¦V.; fame- Â°Both are designed to promote the wel
fare and happiness of the fame citizens. If two
offices a' C incompatible, whether under state go
vprnmpnft or the national government, common
Jenfe will di<st\^ e they ftiould not be lodged
in the fame hands. But a proportion for a total
â¢xcluftoii of member. < Congress and federal of
ficere from any feat or "Â» a tatc , S ove, Â»-
ment, indicates a jealoufyotouT national govern
ment, toa high decree alarming. s " ch apiopo
lition, like the exclusion of Clergymen front ci
vil offices, supposes an enmity between i'ue two go
vernments or two orders of men, which i
each to fortify againlt the other, by erecting an
impaflable barrier. It is a declaration of hoftNi
lies between parties whole very exiilence depenu*
on peace and union. The federal government
stands on the State governments, as on pillars ;
and without thenational government's guaranty,
the independence of a State could not be '.eCuie
for a year. What madness thus to wage war
with the national government! Whatinfatuation
to create fparate interefls, when the whole buli
nefs of this generation is, UNION !
Consolidation, that bug b-ar of ant ifederalilm,
has spread terrific apprehenftons, and made ho
nest men dread the influence of the national go
vernment. But in the name of common fenle,
let tne ask, was ever a nation too firmly confotidated
for the purposes of good government ? Never, it
may be answered, never was a political lociety
too clofcly united for ftrengtli, harmony, and
happiness. Ancient Greece and all modern Eu
rope can teftify, that half the calamities of man_
kind have frown out of the rivalfhips, pride, and
discordant views of petty sovereignties ; nay,
â we ourselves fliould bless God for a tedeial con
stitution, which, by abridging the independence
of the States, extinguiflied the sparks of civil
war, that, in 1755, lay Mattered through the
States, just ready to be blown into a flame. 1 hei e
is no physical certainty that the state govern
merits will ever be melted down into the general
government ; centuries at least must escape, be
fore this event can take place, in the ordinary
proo-refs of political changes. If it ever lhould,
it will probably be the effert of pre-difpofing
causes which will render it neceflary for. public
happiness. But by dividing the interests of the
States, and detaching the officers of the liationa
government from their interest in the State go
vernments, the most effectual bonds of union
will be diflblved, our national laws will be with
out energy, and America may expect to be
icourged with fatfiions, war and conquest. It is
a feiititnent most deeply imprett'ed on my mind,
that the whole business of the present age is,

DISCOURSES ON DAVILA No. XL
Ilvroas procacrl! What bounds your pride fliall hold ?
What check, veftram your thitft of power and gold ?
'"IT* HE arifwer to the questions in the motto, can
A be none other than this, that as nature has
established in the bofoins of heroes no limits to
those paifions ; and as the world, instead of re
straining, encourages them, the check inuft be,
in the form of government.
The world encourages ambition and avarice,
by taking the moll decidcd part in their tavor.
The Roman world approved of the ambition ot
Caesar ; and, notwithstanding all the pains that
have been taken with so much reason, by moral
and political writers to disgrace it, the world has
approved it these 17 hundred years ; and still es
teems his name an honor to the firft empire in
Europe.' Consider the (lory of the ambition and
the fall ofCardinal Wolfey and Archbishop Laud ;
the indignation of the world against their tyran
ny has been very faint ; the sympathy with their
fall has been very Itrong. Consider all the ex
amples in hillory of fuccefsful ambition, you will
find none generally condemned by mankind ;
on the other hand, think of the instances of am
bition unfuccefsful and disappointed ; or ot falls
from great heights, you find the sympathy ofthe
world uuiverfally affected. Cruelty and tyranny
of the blackest kind must accompany the Itory,
to destroy or sensibly diminish this That
world, for the regulation ot whose prejudices,
paifions, imaginations and interests, governments
are instituted, is so unjust, that neither religion,
natural nor revealed, nor any thing, but a well
ordered and well balanced government has ever
been able to correcft it, and that but imperfectly.
It is as true in modern London, as it was in anci
enL Rome, that the sympathy of the worlu is less
excited by the deftrmition ot the lioofe ot a man
of hum it, in obfeurity, or even in middle life,
though it be by the unjust violence of men, than
by Ihe fame (alamity befalling â¢ rich man, by the

With well-feign'd gratitude the pcnfion'd band .

And crowd withfudden wealth the rising dome ;
The price of boroughs and ot fouls reflore ;
And raise his treafurcs higher than bctore :
Now blefs'd with all the baubles of the great,
The polifh'd marble and the shining plate,

And hopes from angry heav'n another fire.
Although the verse, both of the Roman and

in its truth. â _____

HOUSE OF REPRESENTA riVES.
TUESDAY, MAY as.
Mr. GfcK r \'s motion on the tifjumption oj the State debts, which was
inserted in thii paper i J tin 26th, under conjideration
MR. BOUDINOT then rose and saidâl am oile of those, Mr-
Chairman, whoconfider t'.je fubjeft now before you of as
much importance as any that has yet required the attention of Con
gress. When it was firft brought forward, it was new to me ; I
therefore determined in my own mind, patient!) to hear both
fides of the question, and to weigh every argument before 1 drew
any positive conclusion : being also a State creditor (tho' in the ha
bit ot receiving interest from the State) my fears were excited,
lead felfintereft might miftead my judgment.âOn the(e account*
the committee have hitherto not received any trouble in the com
munication of my fentimcnts on this important question. I have
contented myfclf with a silent vote, and fttould havp dill continu
ed in the fame disposition, had not the gentleman who spoke ort
this fubjeft* whfn it was last under consideration, advanced fomc
arguments and diew certain conclusions from them, that fttuck
me as neither founded in fa6l or reason. He appeared to me to
involve the fubjett in unnecessary perplexity, and tho' Ample in
itfelf, became obfeurefrom the terms by which h was diftinguilfc
ed and the manner in which live argument was handled. It has
been generally denominated " the assumption of the State debts;"
from whence a bxcJtander might suppose that the States, or fomc
individual State, had called upon us to aflume a debt or debts that
we owed to them ; but nothing is further from the truth. What
is the fubjtft before us ? It is an application of our creditors, qn
which a question arises, whether a Certain species of debt, eviden
ced by certificates from an individual State, is pau of the do
mestic debt of the United States, or whether it is the private debt
I of the individual State 7
Let us then fimplify the question and ronfider it abflra&ly on its
true principles ; for if it lhoÂ«ld turn out to be the fuft, no man
can aftign a good reason why a disci iininatiofi should be made a
mong our creditors. If the fact, it will be as difficult to assign a
reason why we iiould now aiTume them. The honorable gentle
man who spoke last against the afTurnptioo of these debts put the
question on proper principles, but his arguments appeared to be
exceedingly fallacious. He alledged, â¢â¢ that it had been contend
ed that the State debts are in their nature debtsof the United States,
and that the individual creditors can of right claim payment of the
fame from the general government. lie denied the principle, and
said that if these debts be nothing more than the debts of the U
nited States, under another denomination, and if we are bound
to provide for them as for the debts of the United States, let gen
tlemen conflder whether they arc not bound to view them in thiA
light whe fever they may be found, meaning in the State treasuries."
This state of the question neccfTarily leads to an investigation
of the nature of the debts ptopofed to be funded by the amend
ment now moved tÂ® ihe bill for funding the domestic debt of the
United States.
These debts consists of certificates given by the individual States
forâpay to the army âdepreciation of payâmilitia fervicesâfupplits
found, and âservices rendered. As these arc all on one tooting, to
avoid pcplexity, I will take the army debt for an example. This
debt was contra&ed by the United States in Congress assembled.
When our common Country was threatened with an invasion by a
very powerful enemy* the necessary defence tequired the railing
of an army. âA union of the States was formed, and a confedera
tion entered into, that the expcnces for the common defence
flmuld be paid out of a public trealury, to be supplied by the rcf
pefchve States according to their fevcral abilities. Troops were
accordingly brought into the field, un ier certain ftipnlations of pay
andfupport. Several years pad away, and the soldiers not only
bravely fought your battles, but in the end fecurcd your liberties,
and cftabliCned your independence.
The States having failed in supplying your treasury, the stipulat
ed payments were ncgle&ed, large atrears accruea, and after a
fencs of fufferings (unknown to any other troops) a mutiny took
place, and the deftruttiofi of your army was well nigh accom
plilhedâBy the exertions of your commander in chief, and the
most judicious management on his part, this serious disturbance
i-nded in commiflioners being sent to Congress with requifuions on
the part of the whole army, requesting redress in a number of in
llauces.
Suffer me to read the report of the grand Committee of Con
gefsand their subsequent refolutiom in anfwertothisapplication.
" Saturday, January 25, 1783 âThe grand committor, cmfifting of

day of Anguft, 1780, and that the Superintendant of Finance be di
reÃed to take such mcafures as/hall appear to him mofl properfor effefl

cieai .y appear, than that at the time of thei'e resolutions, Congrcfs
MJafidcud .he Uobt due to the army for pay and depreciation ot
jay, as well as that due to their other creditors, as the particular
L '"'^ d States.âHete was no pretenccof denying the
contrast or turning them over to the S.ates for payment. It is
true, Congrds in thalercfolutiotu call upon the individual States,
to fettle with their lines of the arm) to a given day, but the pay
JS to come trom adequate funds to be provided by the efforts of
ongre s romtlie teveral Stales. Iu obedienceto this requisition,
the Stales proceed to the fcttlemerif, not only of the Day to the

Turnithed to contiadlors, comm lfane, and quarter-matters witli
all their holt ot-deprndants, and'ec lifieaies of the balances due

who thereby agietably to the foregoing resolutions, became fecu

ed to demand of the kveral States, an import of 5 per cent, ad va

United States, and, additional fuins for 25 years, adequate to the
payment of the intrrtft of the whole debt agreeably to. their affur.
ances in answer to the memorial if the army.
Some of the Stat** compÃed with this requisition, and provided
supplementary hinds ovcd and above the impoll tor 25 years -but
others refuting, the whole pcoj'ett wis rendered abortive and the
creditors of the union left in the most diftrefling circumftancej.
â¢ ihe clamours ot the citizcns wete too great to be withilood bv
manpof the States yvhoconfidered themfetves as sureties for the
â¢united States, and indeed under aneceflityof rendering foine im
mediate, tuo' partial fupplies,to prevent everything running into
<onfuiion. They thereupon undertook tq pay their own citizens
Jie inieretl due on their refpeftive certificates, whether given by
1 ie Ipecial oflirer* of Congrets (as the coramitiioners ot loan) or
under the dircrtion of the Itandard before mentioned. The State
Â«>l Ncw-Jeifev in this way paid five years intertft, to the amount
<11 leveral hundred thousand dollars. But although th â Ir partial
1 ayments put the evil day farther otf, yet the time at last came
' w ' len goud We ps tlie people, finding the government una
l ie to support Itfclt and comply with their engagements, and fee
ing nothing but ruin aud confufioii before tiiem, wifely brought
about another revolution, and formed a new conaitution founded
on a more intimate union us the (e*eral States, with greater and
more efficient powers for the purpole of ejUbliJhing jujlt. t , infurinr
ttouvjiic ttanijuUity r j)romotfng the general wtjare tnJfeturui' the blel-
J:ngJ Itj liberty. J
Provision was'alfo rxprefsly made, that all dibts and engage
njents binding on the lormer government, lhoold be equally va
lid againll the prcftnt. Under this new conUuution, the govern
ment is veftcd 111 the fullelt manner with all the resources and
funds necelfary for the paymrnt of the general debt of the union,
Â»nd what thej had in vain asked of the several Slates under the
former conlorieration. Ol course (he individual Stale was de
prived of them, and no longer had it in her power to continue
her partial aids towards fatisfying the growing interest on the de
mands of their citizens.
Iri this foliation, and under these circumstances, our creditors
cams forward, with the evidences of their demands given hy
the individual State by order ot the United States in Con<refs af
lemblcd, and demand payment of us, as their original debtor,
lor whom they performed the services and to whom they granted
thefupplies, allcrfging that by the transfer of the revenues and
/efources ot government from the refpe&ive States (o us, their fe
curtty is invalidated and we arc become able to pay them, agreea
bly to the fpint of our original contract. These quMlions then
lairlv arise,
Was the contrail originally ouri, or were the United States the
original debtor ?â if so, has the creditor been paid his jull due, or
lias he releafctl us from thr obligation ?
There caibe no doubt in my opinion, from the foregoing view
of the circumlfance! of the cale ; and 1 believe no gentleman will
deny, but that we are the original debtors as reprelcniin- (he for
mer government.
It is asclear that all the creditor has received for his demand
.*ias been a ceitifi-atc from the Stat--, tellifyiug a certain bailee'
die to him for his Cervices, or for supplies rendered. And here
J should enter into the argument, to (hew that (his certificate from
the State cannot on any principles of jujiice, honor or po/ict be
considered as payment, was not already done to mv
band in language so much more"forcible than any I can use on
ibis occasion, and the omiflion of which would be impnfing on
tiie committe-. This will be found in the 322 d and 413 th pages
o( the Congrrllional Register, where an Mr
jVladilon) in (peaking on the lubjeft of public certificates, thou gh
to another point, favs, " Let us consider firll by whom the debt
was contracted, and then to whom it is due. The debt was con
tracted by the United States, who with refpeft to that particular
tranfa&ion were in a national capacity. The government was no
thing more than the agent or organ by which the whole body of
the people attcd. The charigeiri the government which has taken
place, has enlarged its national capacity, but it has not varied the
national obligation with refpeft to the engagements entered into
by that transitionâfor in like manner the present government is
noshing more than ihe organ or agent of the public. There is
110 change in our political duty nor In the moral or political ob
ligationâThe language I now use is the language of the conftitu.
tion itfelfâitdeclarts that all debts Ihjll have the fame validity
agamft the United Statu, under the new asunder theoldf.rmof
governmentâThe obligation remains the lame, though 1 hope ex
perience will prove that the ability has been favorably varied."
âAgain a debt was fairly contracted ; according to juftjee and
good faith it ought to have been' paid in gold or Tilv cr. A piece
of paper was only fubltituted. Was this paper equal to gold or
silver ? No ; it was worth in the market no more than oue eighth
or one seventh of that value. Was this depreciated paper freelv
acceptcd ?No ; the government offered thai or nothing. The re
lation of the individual to the government and circumstances of
the offer, rendered the acceptance a forced, not a tree one. Again
â" Here there debt acknowledged to have been once due,
and which w"asne\er discharged, because the payment was fo'ccd
and defective ; the balance consequently is. ftili due, and is of as
facrcd a natuic as the claims of the holders can be. ThefeconcJu
five arguments agply with double force to the question before the
committee. Was the debt contra&ed by the United States ? If so
where have they any evidence of payment ? If it is answered in
the ftatc certificates, I reply, a piece of paper was only substituted
lor the bare purpose of afccitaining the balanee as preparatory to
its being funded,and that by the particular order of Cougrefs,un
der the idea of providing the creditor with fecur-ity for his debts.
Was this paper equal to gold and silver or any other substantial pay
ment ? The relation oT the individual to the government and cir
cuipftances of the offer, rendered the acceptance s forced, not a
free one. But, fir, a part of the is still unenfwerecl. It
is {aid that if thefc are debts of the United States in the hands of
individual citizens, niujl they not be the debts of the United States
in the Treasuries of the different states. I auffrer by no means.
This argument is cxtremclyj fallacious.. Iri common life, if.anv
person who becomes my fecaritv, pays the debt for me and he
owes me money. J can with propriety refufe to'-pay- him till he fct
tks.|ais debt with me ; but if such fecuriiy icfufes, or is unabJed
to pay the dclt to my Creditor, I certainly have no to put off
.my creditor till the security (hall have paid me what he may owe
me. * (To continued.)
MONDAY, JUNE 21, 1790.
THE bill to etlabiifli the Poll-Office and Port;
Roads in the United States, was brought in
engrofled, and read the third time. The blanks
were filled up.âThe fine for detaining the mail
was set at a funi not exceeding 5 dollars for every
halt hour. The falaryof the Post-Master-Gener

Pott-Matters 20 pr. cent, on the pottage of letters
received at their refpe<ftive offices.âThe blanks
being filled up, the bill was palled.
Reports from the Secretary at War on sundry
petitions were read.
The bill for repealing after thelaftdayof
the duties heretofore laid on spirits, &c. was ta
ken into consideration.âThe queltion was, whe
ther the bill fhould*be engrofled.
Mr. Stone observed, that no man could be more
in favar of making provision for the debt of the
United States, than himfelfâbut the present bill
pointed out a mode which he conceived to be the
worst that could be devisedâthe mod exception
able, and would turn out the most unproduÂ«fiive.
He ffiould therefore vote against the bill on a full
conviction that other funds, entirely unexcept
ionable, might be found, and which might be
contained perhaps in a quarter of a Iheet of pa
per. Hefaid he should call for the Ayes and Noes.
Mr. Carrol observed, that as so much time had
been taken up in maturing the bill, he hoped
that it would pass to be engrofledâthe business
is of very great importance, and ought now to be
finilhed. He wished therefore that the Ayes and
Noes might not be called in the present ttage of
the bill, as it would not, he conceived, answer the
purpose intended by the gentleman.
Mr. Stone withdrew his motion.
Mr. Bloodworth renewed the motion, but as.
terwatds he withdrew it.
Mr. Page said he hoped that the Ayes and Noes
would be called. -
Mr. Jackson was also in favor of coming to ai:
ultimate dccifio'n on the bill.
Mr. Gerry said if there is a majority of the
house who are determined to reje(A the bill, he
could not feeof.whatufeit was to have itengfofled.
Mr. Fitzfimpns said he had observed, that if this
bill ihould be-*eje<aed, there would be great dif
ficulty in finding other resources He wilhed
that the House would now decide npon it.
Mr. Vining spake in favor of the bill, and was
Tor trying theitrength of the house on the quef
ion, and in that; view >vas in favor of calling the
iyct and Noes. Thequeftion on engroffin? the

no doubt that 5 would take J years. '
Mr. Williamfon said he differed from the Â«

to the board's being an impeachment or imnm

The powers proposed to be veiled,are much mm

Mr. Smith, (S. C.) moved thatthe claufewhich
deprives the States of the power of transferino
the debts due to them from the United States
should be (truck out. He observed that he could
fee no reason for the prohibitionâit appears ab.
surd that a State should not have it in its power
to transfer its demands against the United States
to its creditors.âHe wished that gentlemen would
assign the reafoijsfor the clause.
Mr. Sedgwick said he would give the reafon

the United States, in the hands of foreigners -
This was a desirable obje<ft, and ought to be at
tended to as far as pollible.âln refpedt to tha
domestic debt, it was to be lamented, that so much
ofit was in the hands of foreignersâ this however
could not be prevented ; but with refpeft to the
present cafe, it may be done without any injury
whateverâand therefore we ought to extend the
prohibition aÂ« far as we can confident with juitice

the States like childrenâindividuals may transfer

that my whole life has been spent as if bound

It now remains for me to make it to the nation
which has adopted me, and the sovereign whom

To the WIDOW of MALABAR.

'Twixt love, fire, fear, and widowhood and death ;
While I for such fiÂ£litious jlrifc ain harness'd â
I feelâl than half in earnelt :
By Bramins feiz'dâthole bloody-minded fellows â

And seems, in truth, a rigfct good-natur'd foul :
He swears himfelf his Drama, without vanity,
Is founded on the basis of Humanity ;
Without one rule or unity infringing,
Hefav'd his Heroine from a mortal fingeing â
So after all this mighty fire and rattle,
Ourbloodlefs Play is like a bloodless Battle.
Am I to blame, if, this dear life to save,
I lik'd a lover better than a grave ;
Piefeir'd your chtiftian maxims for .1 Drama,
To all the murd'rous rite# of Pagan Brama ;
And held, retreating from my fun'ral Urn,
14 'Twas better far to marry than to burn ?"
No- I'll be burn'd but every Maid and Widow,
Would do, in such a cafe, just as I did do.
Yes thank your stars, Columbia's happy Dames !
Ye need not fear those trigntfuL fun'ral flames :
Of other lands let foreign Baids be dreaming,
But this, this only is the laud for women :
Heie ye invert the Braiftin's barb'rou| plan,
And stretch your fceptrc o'er the Tyrant-Mail.
Ye Men. if I offend, l ask your pardon,
I would not for the world your sex hear hard on.
Te are the fathers, founders of a nation,
The Gods on Earth, the Lords ot this Creation!
And kt Philosophers fay what they please,

Your Conftttution newly madeâand mendedâ

THE TABLET. No. CXXV.
" The voice of the people is the voice of GOD:"
IT is remarkable that so old and celebrated a
truth, as that Contained in my mono, should
be so often disputed, and so often inif'applied.
The voice of the peopleis frequently referred to,
when it dees not exilt; and it is sometimes deni
ed, when it has an existence. I made some ob
servations in the last number, to shew that the
public opinion is often too indefinite to beadmit
ted as a rule of condurt. But still there are ca
fes where it is not indefinite, and where it furiiilh
es a good rule ofcondudl.
In! all situations, where inftin<fl is a better
guide than reason ; and where habits have so long
prevailed, as to make it presumable they are
founded in natural propriety," it should be sup
posed the general sense of the people will seldom
499
be erroneous. In situations likewise, where the
people hav.e it in their power to know all the
circumstances of a cale, and where the effects of
a decision will, operate uniformly in all parts of
the community, the public voice will generally
bethe voice of truth and nature. Hut there are
few occasions where all these advantages concur
in fixing a public opinion. Moll of the quetti
ons that are difcutfed by a L.egillature are artend
ed with new and extraordinary circumstances.
The most eflential facls that come into confidera. .
tion, in any given qucition, may be known only
to part ofthe community ; and the operation ofa
measure proposed may not be alike beneficial in
the several diftritftsof the commonwealth.
It will readily be acknowledged that a repre
sentative ihould deem the opinion of his constitu
ents as a fafe and proper rule of conducft, unlets
he makes some new discovery of fatfts or reasons,
which were unknown to them, when they com
municated their ideas to him. The people of the
United States entertain a fentinieflt that
they cannot fafely relinquish "die practice of
choosing their own Representatives ; aÂ»id that ci
vil liberty would receive a'dangerous blow, ifthe
right of trial by jury was surrendered, or the li
berty of the press abolished. It is not probable
any convention of the people, or any biegiflature
can have better means of determining such points
than the people at large polfefs. The general
impreflionsof the community on those permanent
subjects Ihould be viewed as a better criterion of
judging, than the theories or reflexions of learn
ed and sagacious individuals.

On Thursday last arrived here the Brig Betsy,

Rollins informs, that three days before he failed,
a fire broke out in Port Louis, which raged with
such violence that but one house (the property
of Mess. M'Kean and Co.) escaped falling a prev
to this deltrutftive element. It was fuppofeH
the time, by the inhabitants, that the town
purposely set on fire by the military.
Capt. Rollins further informs, that at
time of his failing, the soldiers were embark,
on board two traufports, and were to fail in a

NEW-YORK, JUNE 23, 1790.
ExtraÃ of a letter from England, dated April 21/?, 1790.
w The French patriotic party will, I trust, cftablilh liberty, bu-t
not perpetuate it, unlcfs they provide fofcjhe amendment of their
present constitution ; a single house of aflembly is a one-handed
body ; and consisting of aristocrats and democrats, will never
incorporate any more than oil and water, though they may be
jumbkd together and intermixed by accident; one or the other
will be uppermoft.âTiie political influenza does not seem to have
fri7cd the inhabitants of Britain a yet j but I eonje&ure wrong,
or those that hold or wifli to hold places and power under the
grant of royalty, are afraid left some ill wind, as they would ftilc
it, (hould waft it over, jmd produce that reform which, though
they have talked o/, have never wittied, and now oppose in
the firft inftan<_e under the plausible pretended plea of innovation.
See Burke and Pitt ; wc/e they what they once profeffed to beâ
friends to a reformânow is the time to eft". 61 it, when the spirit
of liberty is so prevalent and spreading, that men of arbitrary
principles would be glad to compound and agree to every nectf
fary reform through Fear of endangering their whole system. We
have a dilTolution of parliament $t hand ; what might be the con
vulsion if at the moment it commences, the influenza Ihould be
come general in Great-Britain? Early conceflions to moderate
reasonable demandswnight have secured governing privileges and
powers, which for wint thereof have been forever loft. See the
hiftoryof the American revolution, and the tranfadlions of Fiance
during the reign of the present Louis.
The late Emperor is succeeded in his hereditary dominions by
a person of most amiable difpofaion, according to general con
ccflion. He enters upon a very involved government, and if will
require all his abilities and address to secure his poffdflions, and
lender them permanent and prosperous.
The King of Pruflia has probably long imbibed the principles
of his predecessor, to secure and improve his dominions by weak
ening the house of Austria. I therefore credit the information
given in the papers of his having formed an alliance with the
Turks, and intending to enter into a war with'the Emperor's fuc
cellor. This step, lam fearful, will eventually make us parties
in the quarrel. of approaching hostilities on
the continent I view as a political reason for hastening the dilTo
lution of Parliament as much as pollible ; that so ministry may
be secure of pliant tools for seven years certain ; but I hope the
electors will be so far apprized of it in time, as to let their repre
sentatives know, when about choosing them, that it is expelled
they should seek the peace and profpeiity of the nation, and pre
vent a general ruin from the incieafe of the public debt by a new
war.

The appearance of the day before yesterday
confirmed this remark, when the King, with the
Queen and Dauphin went to visit the Foundling
Hospital. Instead of the imposing retinue, which
lince the haughty reign of Lewis XIV. had sepa
rated the king from his fubjeifts, whenever he
appeared in public, an immense concourse of
people followed their Majelties carriage, and
lhouts of long live the King, the Queen and the
Dauphin, resounded from every quarter.
An augmentation which the King of Sardinia

occasion were very warmâThe setting of the
National Alfembly was prolonged until 7 o'clock
in the "evening, when the following decree was
pafled. 1
" The National Aflembly decrees, as a consti
tutional article, that the law /hall no longer ac
knowledge as foleinti, the vows of perlons of ei

religious orders and congregations in whichfuch
vows are made, are, and lhall renvain fupprefled
in France, and the celic lhall not be eftablilhed
again hereafter. All the individuals of either
sex at prefenc in the monasteries and religious
houses, may leave them, by making their decla
rations for that purpose to the municipality of
the place, and they lhall be immediately support
ed by a reasonable pension. Houses (hall like
â wrfe be appointed for the reception of such as do
not chose to avail themselves of this decree.
The National Aoembly moreover declares, that
no change shall take place lgr the prefeiit with
refpecft to houses charged with the care of pub
lic education, and charitable inllitutions, until
Tome measures are adopted oil this head. The
Nuns may remain inthehoufes in which they are
at presentâthe Aflembly expressly exempting
them from the decree, which obliges the monks
to unite the members of the several lioufes into
one.
The National Aflembly v. snt in proceflion 011

Paris at the Te Deum, at the church of Notre
Dame, on account of the proceedings of the 4th.
Detachments of the National infantry and caval
ry, preceded and closed the marchâfrom break
of day until their arrival, the national soldiery
lined the streets, and presented their anns as the
representatives of the Nation palled through, who
entered the church amidst the music of drums
and trumpets, firing of cannon and ringing of
bells.âThey were preceded by a deputation of
the Commons, lead by tlier Mayor. The Abbe
Mulot, a regular canon of St. VitTtor, had the ho*
nor to compliment them in the name of the Com*
mons, of whom he has been president. Te De
um was performed by a numerous orchestra*
coinpofed of the ablest matters. There was age -
neral illumination in the evening, and the Hotel
de Ville was diftinguiflied by its^magnificence.
HAMBURG, Feb. 14.
The accounts refpecting.tlie negociations for
peace, between the Empress and the Turks,
which were said to be continued at Jafly or
Hufch, a castle at some distance from the capital
of Moldavia, are absolutely contradictory. The
following intelligence may be relied on as au
thentic.
The Effendi who came to Hufch to treat about
peace, has been recalled. Before his departure,
he waited 011 Prince Potemkin, who pafled some
spirited remarks on the conduct of the Porte,
" That the Empress would no longer consider
" lierfelf bound by her offer to content herfelf
" with Oczakow and the Crimea, and trusted
" with the blefling of God to convince the Di
" van ofits imprudence, in rejecting her mode
" rate and equitable propositions " At the in
terview, he kept the Effendi standing, having
previously ordered all the chairs and ibphas out
of the room.
BRABANTINE REVOLUTION.
Extrafl of a litter from Brt/Jfelt of the I th of Ft 6.
The meetings of the Aitembly of the Nation
in this city, are very tumultuousâgreat objecti
ons are made to the committee of Bredaâand
severe remonstrances are made against the usur
pation of the sovereignty by the Nobles and Ec
cleliaftics. Both parties are alfiduoufly at
work, the one to consolidate their pofleflion
of the sovereignty, the other to overset this
edifice of perlional grandeur. A letter from
the Abbe Leempoel at the Hague, profeflor of
logic in theuniverfity ofLouvain, has been print
ed and industriously circulated, which declares
that the three powers which promise to favor our
revolution, will give no assistance in cafe of ne
celfity, if the least alteration is attempted against
the plan of government, prescribed by the com
mittee of Breda. The subject of this letter has
been severely handled by the opposite party, in
the meeting? of the Aflembly, and is considered
as a political stratagem, concerted by the authors
of the opposite fyfteni. Mr. Henry Vander
Noot has in vain attempted to exert his credit
and influei.ee, as piime minister of the admini
stration, to calm this ferment, by offering to the
affbeiates of the five fermens, another form of an
oatli, which he hoped every one would be falisfied
â with, and take without scruple. This offer did not
succeed. The connection with foreigners contri
butes to disturb people's minds. More than one
commiflary, or emissary from the neighbouring
powers, reside at Bruflels. They are publickly
named, one of whom has rendered eflential ser
vices to the committee of Breda. Count de la
Marck has returned from Paris, it is he, and not
his brother, the Duke d'Ahremberg, who can
manage the Belgian affairs in Francc. The se
cond this family is not only at Bruflels, but
gave the 14th inft. a splendid entertainment, as
chief of all the fermens, to the officers of that bo
dy and the volunteer companies, confiding of
240 covers. " Every one admires the invincible
" devotion (faysone of the public prints) of this
" respectable houseâand the names ofd'Ahrem
" berg and d'Urfel will be forever engraved in
" the hearts of the Belgians." The report that
this last nobleman had refuined liis place as pre
sident of the war department, is not true, he still
withdraws from the management of public af
fairs, and is not the only person who is discon
tented with the appointment of Baron Schon
field to the command of the foreign troops in the
Belgian service. To be continued.
A curious Anecdote of two Negroes in France.
IN the moll flourilhing period of the reign of
Lewis XIV. two negro youths, the foils of a
prince,being brought to the Court of France, the
kingappointed a jesuit toinftru<ftthemin letters,
and in the christian religion ; and gave to each of
500
the in a commiifton ii\ his guards. The elder, -who
was remarkable for his candour and ingenuity
made great improvements, more particularly in
the doctrines of" religion. A brutal officer, upon
some dispute, insulted him with a blow.' The
gallant youth never so much as offered to refew,
ic. A person, who was his friend, took an oppor
tunity to talk with him that evening alone upon
his behaviour, which he told him was too tame
especially in a soldier. Is there, then, said the
young African, one revelation forfoldiers and an
other for merchants and gownmen ? The gaoj
father, to whom I owe all my knowledge, has
earneltly inculcated forgivenel's of injuries tome ;
alluring me, that a christian was by no means tu
retaliate abules of any kind. The good father
replied his friend, may fit you for a monastery
by his leflons, but never for the army and the
rules of a court. In a word, continued he, ifyou
do not call the colonel to ail account, you willbo
branded with the infamy of cowardice, and have
your commission taken from you. I would fain
answered the youngman, a (ft confidently in eve
ry thing : But since you press me with thatveeard
to my honor which you have always (hewn, ] wj|J
wipe off so foul a stain ; though I must own I
ried in it before. Immediately upon this hede
lired his friend to go from him, and appointee
aggreflor to mefct him early in the morning,
cordingly they met and fought ; and the brave
youth disarmed his adversary, and forced him to
ajk his pardon publicly. This done, the next
day he threw up his commilfion, and desired the
king's leave to return to his father. At parting,
he embraced his brother and his friend, with
tears in his eyes, faying, " He did not imagine
the Christians were such unaccountable people;
and that he could not apprehend their faith was
of any use to tliem, if it did not influence their
p: aftice. In my country, we think it no dilho
nor to adl according to the principles of our re
ligion."
