THE WORCESTER SPECULATOR.
I WAS engaged the other day, a few hours, in conversation with
a neighbourâHe is an hone ft husbandman, and leads a peace
ful life in the cultivation of his farm, and in the care of a family.
ââ¢' I wi(h," fays he, " I was better acquainted with the real situa
tion of my country â-whether we (hall probably be a happy, or
an unhappy people âwhether we (hall be cruthed by taxes.âAl
though," continued he, " my attentidn has ever been alive to
public measures, and my wilhesengaged for the prosperity of my
country, my present tears were awakened by the complaints of
othersâand what, too, increased them, was their coming, not from
my own class, men who work hard for their living, but from men
who, one would luppofe, would hardly notice the greatest publick
calamity ; those who appear to lead merry lives, and pass the grea
test part of their time with jolly companions at taverns ; If fach
men have cause to murmur, what will become of the poor farmer*
I cannot, Iconfefs, clfcarly fee grounds for their complaints ; my
ignorance perhaps, is the reason. Though a man of little observa
tion, I have a grateful heart ; and have often acknowledged the
enjoyment of many supposed public bleflings : WÂ« live in a coun
try, from the nature of the government, justly called the land of
freedom ; learning and virtue are every where promoted, and jus
tice unerringly administered ; the climate is favorable, and the
foil good ; For my part I have found no difficulty in supplying,
from my farm, the demands of a large family, and paying my tax
es ; which, though sometimes large, have never been oppreflive :
But how long," added he, looking seriously at me, " this will be
my cafe, how long before calls for the payment of our debts, will
deprive me of such ability, I cannot tell ; fiom the suggestions of
others, I feel alarmed."
His anxiety merited attention : My feelings weie engaged for
him, and most gladly would I have pointed out the latent sources
Â©f public advantage, had it not been taking the part of a politician
farther than my abilities would juftify. However, his fears of an
accumulated buiden from taxation, were very easily removed.â
Our debt, said I, my worthy friend, according to a late report of
the Secretary of the Treasury, amounts to eighty millions of dol
lars : The annual interest of which is upwards of four millionsâ
the inhabitants of America amount nearly to that numberâaffefs
incnts by land and poll tax, with the aid of impost, have been
found equal to the discharge of the annual interest of the said debt,
without oppreflion. Our country is extenfivc, and the increase
of population in no country more rapidâ, Let such interest be an
nually dischargedâthe increase of population, with the constant
accefnons to our improved lands, are the two gieat resources,
Which will prove an increasing finking fund upon the principal,
that will effeflually discharge itâthey are the storehouses, out of
Which, without any additional bui den on ourselves, wc fhallmake
payment of our dents. M But," inquired my honest friend, w (hall
the greatest refourccs of oui country be realized by foreigners, and
â¢we excluded from any benefit of them ?" By no means, replied I.
Thofc must bccrtditors unheard of for their exa&ions, who should
demand, and that a custom unpai allelled for its rigor that should
fan&ion the payment of interest for the whole debt until all was
discharged: Such an idea, if entertained, would be an extrava
gant departure, not only from justice, but from faÂ£Vs. As the debt
is discharged the interest must decrcafe, and our taxes be propor
tionably lightened. The two resources then conftantlyoperating
with increasing effett to the removal of the debt, must realize to us
in a very sensible manner, our advantage from them: They will
at length, added I, redeem themselves; and all their ftrcams be
turned to the watering their own country. Be not discouraged ;
Jet not the most frightful suggestions of the discontented scare you
from youi industry. Taxes, in this country, never havebeen, and
we may confidently believe they never will be the means of im
prifoningthe industrious man. The cafe of the farmer has infome
refpefts been hard, too small a coinpaiative value has been set on
the produce of his farm, when made the confederation of money.
Too free a use of foreign commodities was the reason, the purchaie
of which made large and constant draughts on our fpecic. But
against this evil we are daily fticngthening ourselves : Progress in
preparations for supplying our demands from among ourselves, is
fuccefstully made : The interests of the mechanic, husbandman,
and artisan, are anxiously blended with the firft obje&s of our le
giflatoro. Under their watchful protettion, all the means within
reach for promoting them wil be hunted up. Thus will industry
be encouraged and our money made more plenty.

AMERICAN MANUFACTURES.
WE are happy in inferring the following farts,
corroborative of the advancement of the
manufactures of our country.
The Hon. Mr. Shaw, owner of the beautiful
Ship MajfachufeUs, derigned for the Ealt-India
Trade, from an attachment to his native place,
and to exemplify his disposition to promote the
manufactures of his country, furniflied his Ship
both with cordage and fail cloth from theÃofton
manufactories ; ofthelatterlietooknearly twelve
thousand yards ; which cloth, from the many ex
periments made of it, is pronounced to be fuper
iour to foreign canvas of any fabric whatever ;
one of its lingular excellences is, that it has
hitherto proved incapable of taking mildew, ow
ing to a peculiar manner in preparing the yarns
âand for finnnels of texture and durablenefs of
Wear, is allowed to be far before any other cloth.
The encouragement the promoters of it have
met with in their sales, has induced them to build
another factory, which they have now in hand,and
when completed expert soon to turn out upwards of
two thousand yards a week, which theymake of dif
ferent denominations, from No. I to 8 inclusive:
Tn addition to the above, three other Indiamen
have been wholly cloathed with it, as well as a
great number of vefl'els of every description.
A regular Woolen Manufartory is now eftab
li&ed at Watertown under the direction of Meflrs.
Faulkner and Co. and tho in its infancy, pro
linfes gi'eac success, as they have already made
upwards of tvro thousand yards of Cloth, which
turns out much cheaper than Engli(b Cloths of
the fame quality. ( Majf. Centinel.)

WEDNESDAY, MARCH 17.
Mr. Smith fS. C.) Speech on the report "f the Committee on the mtmoria,
of the People callea Quakers.
(CONTINUED.)
ANOTHER plan was to liberate all those who Ihould be born
after a certain limited period : fucha scheme would produce
this very extraordinary phenomenon,that the mother would be a Have
and her child would, be free. Thel'e young emancipated negroes
by associating with their enslaved parents, would participate in all
the debasement which slavery was fa id lo occasion. But allowing
that a practicable scheme of general emancipation could be devit
ed, there can be no doubt that the two races would still remain
dillinct. It was known from experience that the whites had such
an idea of their superiority over the blacks that they never even
auociated with them; even the warmest friends to the blacks kept
them at a diitance, and rcjeÂ£led all inteicourfe with them Could
any inttance be quoted of their i*ter-marrying; the Quakers
alierted that nature had made all men equal, and that the differ
ence ot colour Ihoutd not place negroes on a worse footing in so
ciety than the whites ; but had any of them ever married a neero
or would any of them fuffcr their children to mix their blood
with that of a black ?âthey would view with abhorrence such an
alliance.
Mr. Smith then read some extracts from Mr. Jefferfon'j notes
on Virginia, prov>ng that negroes were by nature an inferior race
ot beings ; and that the whites would always feel a repugnance at
mixing their blood with that of the blacks. Thus, he proceeded
that refpeftable author, who was dcfirous of countenancing eman
cipation, was on a consideration of the fubjeft induced candidly
to avow thatthe difficulties appeared insurmountable. The friends
to manumission had said that by prohibiting the further importa
tion of (laves and by liberating those born after a certain period
a gradual emancipation might take place, and that in process of
time the very color would,be extinik and there would be none but
whites. He was at a lof> to learn how that consequence would re
sult. If the blacks did not intermarry with the whites, they
would remain black to the end of time ; for it was not contended
that liberating them would whitewash them ; if they did intermar
ry with the whites, then the white race would be extinfi, and the
American people would be all of the mulatto breed. In whatever
light therefore the fubjeft was viewed, the folly of emancipation
was manifell. He truftcd these confideratioru would prevent any
further application to Congrcfs on this point, and would so far
ha\>e weight with the committee as to rejpÂ£l the clause altogether
or at lcaft to declare in plain terms that Congress have no right
whatever to manumit the (laves ot this country.
Various objeflions, said he, had at different times been alledged
against the abominable praQicc, as it had been called, of one man
exercising dominion over another ; but slavery was no new thing
in the worldâthe Romans, the Greeks, and other nations of
antiquity, held (laves at thr lime christianity fiift dawned on so
ciety, and the profeflors of its mild doflrines never preached a
gainst it. Here Mr. Smith read a quotation from the Roman and
Grecian history, and from Come accounts of the government and
manners of the people of Africa, before they had any knowledge
of the African traders, from which he said it appeared that (laverv
was not disapproved of by the apostles when they went about dif
lufing the principles of christianity ; and that it was not owing to
the African trade, as had been alledged, that the people of Africa
made war on each other.
Another objection against flavcrv was, that the number of slaves
in the southern States weakened that part of the Union, and in cafe
ot invasion would require a greater force to protett it. Negroes, it
was fa id, would not fight : hut he would alk whether it was ow
ing to their being black or to their being slaves ; if to their being
black, then unqueftionablv emancipating them would not remedy
the evil, for they would flill remain black ; if it was owing to
their being slaves, he denied the position ; for it was an undenia
ble truth, that in many coumriesflavcs made excellent soldiers.
In Ruflia, Hungary, Poland, the peasants were slaves, and yet
were brave troops. In Scotland, not man) years ago, the High
land peasants wercabfolute slaves to their lairds,and they were re
nowned foj; their bravery. The Turks were as much enslaved as
the negroesâtheir property and lives were at the absolute disposal
of the Sultan, yet they fought with undaunted courage. Many
other instances might be quoted, but those would fuffice to refute
the fact. Had experience proved that the negroes would not make
good soldiers ? He did not aflert that they would, but they had
never been tried ; discipline was every thing ; white militia made
but indifferent soldiers before they were disciplined. It was well
known that according to the present art of war, a soldier was a
mere machine, and he did not fee why a black machine was not
its good as a white one ; in one refpeft the black tioops would have
the advantage by appearing more hoirible in the eyes of the ene
my. But admitting that they would not fight, to what would the
argument lead ? Undoubtedly to (hew that the Quakers, Moravi
ans, and all the non-rcfifting and non-fighting fefcts, constituted the
weakness of a country. Did they not contribute to strengthen
the country against invasion by flaying at home and joining the in
vader as soon as he was fuccefsful ? But they furnifhed money, he
ftiould be told, and paid fubftixutesâand did not the slaves by en
creafing the agriculture of the country add to its wealth, and there
by encreafe its ftrefigth ? did thev not moreover perform many
laborious services in the camp and in the field, aflift in transporting
b a Â£g a Â£ e Â» conveying artillery, throwing up fortifications, and thus
enrreale the numbers in the ranks by supplying their places in thefc
services ? Nor was it neceflary that every part of the empire fliould
furnifh fighting men ; one part supplied men, another moneyâone
part was strong in population, another in valuable exports, which
added to the opulence of the whole. Great-Britain obtained no
soldiers from her East and Weft-India settlements, were they
therefore useless ? She was obliged to fend troops to protest them,
but their valuable trade furniflicd her with means of paying those
troops.
Another objection was, that the public opinion was again!) sla
very: How did that appear ? Were there any petitions on the fub
jefl excepting that from the Pcnnfylvania society and a few Qua
kers ? And were they tojudge for the whole continent? Were the
citizens of the Northern or Eastern States to diflateto Congrefson
a measure in which the Southern Rates were so deeply interested ?
There were no petitions against slavery from the Southern states,
and they were the only proper judges of what was for their inte
rest. The toleration of slavery in the several states was a matter of
internal regulation and policy, in which each state had a right to
do as (he pleated, and no other state had any right to intermeddle,
with her pblicy or laws. If the citiaens ot the Northern states
were displeased with the toleration of slavery in theSoAthern states,
the latter were equally disgusted with some things tolerated in the
former, He bad mentioned on a former occasion the dangerous

tenets and pernicious practices ot the left of Shaking Quakers
who preached against matrimony, and whofc doflrine and rxim

or people it with a fpunous race. However the people of South

' C {Â°J J V n " cd Statcs - The legislature of South Carolina had
prohibited theatrical representations, deeming them improDer
ut they did not trouble Congress with an application to abo'lilh
them m New-York and PhiladelphiaâThe Southern citizen,
might alio consider the toleration of Quakers as an injury to the
community, because in time of war they would not defend their
country from the enemy, and in time of peace they wete liucriei
ing in the concerns of others, and doing every thing in their pow.
'' le laves1 av es in the Southern Hates to infurreftion ; not.
with (landing which the people of those states had not requiredthe
amltance of Congress to exterminate the Quakers.
But he could not help obfervingthat this fqueamilhnefs wasvepy
extroardmary at this time. The Northern states knew tint the
outtiern states had (laves before they confederated with them. If
they had such an abhorrence for slavery, why said Mr. Smith, did
they not cast us off and reject our alliance P The truth was, that
tne molt informed part of the citiiens of the Northern states knew
that slavery was so ingrafted into the policy of the Southern states,
that it could' not be eradicated without tearing up by the roots their
apptnefs, tranquility and prosperityâthat if ii were an evil, it
was one for which there was no remedy, aod therefore, like wife
men they acquiesced in it: We, on the other hand, knew that the
Quaker doftrmes had taken such deep root in some of the states
that all refinance to them mull be useless : We therefore made a
compromise on both fides, we took each other with our mutual
bad habits and refpeflive evils, for better tor worse; the North
ern states adopted us with our (laves, we adopted them with their
Quakers. There was then an implied compact between the North
ern and southern people that no ftcp should be taken to iniure the
property of the latter, or to disturb their tranquility. It was
therefore with great pain he had viewed the anxiety of some of the
members to pay such uncommon refpefl to the memorialists as
even to let aside the common rules of proceeding, and attempt to
commit the memorials the very day they were presented, though
the Southern members had folic.ted one day's delay. Such pro
ceedings had jullly railed an alarm in the minds of his Souther,,
colleagues; and feeling that alarm, they would have acted a dis
honorable part to their constituents had they not expreded them-
d warmth anci fo'icitude which some gentlemen had
A proper confutation of this business, must convince every
candid mind, that emancipation would be attended with one or
other ot these consequences ; cither that a mixture of the races
would-degenerate the whites, without improving the blacks or
that it would create two separate clalTesof people in the communi
ty involved in inveterate hoftil.ty, which would terminate in the
" d "'l'P 2 " 0 ' 1 of one or the other, as the Moors were
pelled from Spain and the Danes from England. The negroes
would not he benefited by it ; free negroes nevei improve in tal
ents, never grow rich, and continue to associate with the people
0 their own color. This is owing either to the natural averfio.i
tne whites entertain towards them, and an opinion of the fupe
nonty of their race, or to the natural attachment the blacks have
ot ole of their own color; in either cafe it proves that they will
alter manumission continue a diftinft people, and have separate in
terells. The author already quoted, has proved that they are an
interior racc even to the Indians.
Alter the last war a number of negroes which had been stolen
trom the southern States, and carricd to England, either quitted
ry C P, ons w "Â° carried them there, or were abandoned by them.
Unable to provide for themselves, and rejefkd from the society of
the common people of England, they were begging about the
ltreets ot London in great numbers ; they supplicated captains of
vellels to carry them back to their owners in America, preferring
ilavery there, to freedom in England. Many of them were (hip
ped to Africa by the humanity of the Englilh, and were either
butchered or made (laves by their savage countrymen, or refhip
ped lor sale to the plantations.
But some persons have been of opinion that if the further impor
tation of (laves could be prohibited, there would be a gradual
extinction of the species. Having (hewn the absurdity of libera
t'ngth cpojlnati without extendingit to all the (laves old and vounÂ»,
n in. B [w absurdity and even impra&ibility of extending it to
all, I'ha 11 fay a few words with regard tothe extinaion ; that
would be impoflible, because they increaseâto occaflon an extinc
tion, Congress mult prohibit all intercourse between the sexes s
this would be an ast of humanity they would not thank us for,
nor would they be pervaded that it was lor their own good, or
Congress mud, like' Herod, order all the children tobe put to death
asloonas born. If then nothingbutevil wonld refultfrom eman
cipation, under the existing circumstances of the country, why
ihould Congress stir at all in the business, or give any countenance
to luch dangerous applications. We have been told that the go
vernment ought to manifeft a disposition inimical to this praftile
which the people reprobate. If some citizens, from mSfinforma
lion and ignorance have imbibed prejudices against the southern
States, if ill-intentioned authors have related falfe fafls, and.gross
misrepresentations tending to traduce the character of a whole State,
and to millead the citiiens in other States, is that a fufficient real
lon why a large territory is to be depopulated, merely to gratify
the with of some mifinformed individuals ? But what have the ci
tizens of the other States to do with our (laves ? Have they any
right to interfere with our internal policy?
This is not an object of general concern, for I have already prov
ed that it does not weaken the Union ; but admit that it did, will
the abolition of slavery strengthen South-Carolina ? It can only
be cultivated by (laves ; the climate, the nature of the foil, anci
ent habits, forbid it by the whites ; experience convinces us of the
truth ot this. Great-Britain made every attempt to fettle Georgia
bv whites alone and failed, and was compelled at length to intro
duce Haves ; after which, that State increased very rapidly in o
pulence and importance. If the slaves gre emancipated, they will
not remain in that countryâremove the cultivators of the foil,
and the whole of the low country, all the fertile rice and indigo
Iwamps will be deserted, and become a wilderness' What then
becomes of its strength ? Will such a fchemc increase it ? Instead
ol mcrcafing the population of the whites, there will be no whites
at all; if the low country is deserted, where will be the commerce,
the valuable exports of that countiy, the large revenue raised from
itsimports and from the consumption of the rich planters ? In a
(hort time the northern and eastern States will supply us with their
manufactures; if you depopulate the rich low country of South-
Carolina and Georgia, you will give us a blow which will imme
diately recoil on yourselves. Suppose that 140,000 slaves in those
States, which require annually five yards of cloth each, making
700,000 yards at hills a dollar a yard, this makes 350,000 dollars,
bcfidcs the articles of linen, flannel, oznaburgh, blankets, molasses,sugar and ram for the ufeof the negroes; now, either the eastern
and middle States will supply us with all these articles or they will
receive the benefit of the impost on them if they were imported
from foreign countries. Without the rice iwamps of Carolina,
Charleston would decay, so would the commerce of that city : this
would injure the back country. If you injure the Southern States,
the injury would reach our Northern and Eastern brethren ; for
the States are links of one chain : if we break one the whole must
tall to pieccs. Thus it is manifeftthat in proportion to theincreafe
of our agriculture will our wealth be increased ; the increase of
which will augment that of our lifter will either sup
ply us with their commodities, or raise a large revenue uponus,
â¢or be the carriers of our produce to foreign markets.
(to be continued.)
WEDNESDAY, APRIL 7.
Several petitions were read.
In ommittee of the whole on the bill provid
ing for the punilhment of certain crimes against
the United States. âMr. Livermore in the
chair.
Several fediions of the bill were difcufled.
The clause which enacfls chat counterfeiting the
securities of the United States, or uttering coun
terfeits knowingly, shall be punished with death,
by being hanged, it was moved, should be amend
ed by ltriking out the words " punished with
death by being hanged," to admit a less punish
ment for uttering or passing, than for counter
feiting. The degrees of criminality in the two
cases were accurately defined by Mr. Sherman.
Mr. Sedgwick observed, that he thought the
degrees of punishment ought to be proportioned
to the malignity of the offence.
He enlarged on the pernicious consequences of
counterfeiting : He considered it as a crime a
gainlfc the molt important interests of societyâ
and of a peculiarly malignant tendency in the
present and probable situation of the U ni ted States.
Persons addicted to forgery, are seldom, if ever,
reclaimedâthe security of the society therefore
appears to depend, on a capital punishment.â
The idea is ltrengthened when we reflect on the
mifchiefand ruin which have already enfuedfrom
forgery,
Mr. Sedgwick afterwards conceded to the
clause as it stood.
Mr. Fitzsimons was opposed to the motionâ
He adverted to the pra<fiice and experience of
Great Britainâthe injurious and fatal consequen
ces to credit which reiult from Forgery, are con
sidered in England in so feriousa point of light,
that the Bank pays notes which they know to be
counterfeit. Hence the inexorable rigor of the
laws of that country in cases of forgery. He
could not fee so clearly,as lome gentlemen appear
to, the difference between forging, and fiinplyut
tering what is known to be counterfeitâthe mif
chiefis not compleated till the forgery is uttered.
He enlarged on the idea of guarding public pa
per by every possible expedient.
Mr. White obfeived, that he was opposed in
general to inflicfting Death, except for murder,
or crimes which might terminate in murder; but
in the present cafe, he thought there were degrees
of guilt, and the punilhinent ought to be propor
tioned. He was moreover opposed to a capital
punilhment in this cafe, as he conceived it would
tend to prevent convictions.
Mr. Sherman laid he had known persons who
had been convicfted of this crime, that had after
wards reformed.
Mr. Smith and Mr. Burke were opposed to
the motion. They severally dilated on the in
juries which society was liable to, from the in
genuity of tliefe unprincipled personsâthe ex
treme difficulty of guarding against their depre
dations rendered it highly expedient they should
be cut off.
The vote being taken on the motion, it was ne
gativedâand the clause retained.
Further progress was made in the discussionâ
but the com mittee rose without going thro the bill.
Adjourned.

a reduction of the Impolt on Cottonâwhich was
referred to a committee of Five Members, viz.
Mr. Goodhue, Mr. IVadfworth, Mr. Syhcfler, Mr.
Clymer, and Mr. Gale.
The committee, to whom was referred the ac
counts of the Printers, for newspapers, reported,
That those accounts be paid out of the appropria
tion for contingent expencesâand that in future
no more newspapers be supplied the House on the
public account.
The committee to whom the accounts of the
Treafurerof the United States were referred,
brought in a report, which is, that the accounts
are properly stated, and the expenditures agree
able to appropriations made by law.
In committee of the whole, âThe bill on crimes
and puniihments under consideration. The dil
cullion was finifhed this dayâThe committee rose
and reported the bill with sundry amendments.
It was then moved that the bill with the amend
ments be referred to a (elect committee. 1 his
motion was loit. The amendments were taken
up by the House, and some of them agreed to â
others rejeCledâand to-morrow alligned for the
third reading of the bill.
A meflage was received from the Senate with
the bill for further suspending part of the Collec

request the concurrence of the House.
Mr. Smith, (S. C.) moved, that a joint com
mittee be appointed to consider and determine at
what time the conunifllons of the Members of the

Mr. Ames of the committee of conference, on
the disagreement between the two Houses, ref

remilfions of fines, penalties and forfeitures in cer
tain cases, reported that the committee had at
tended that fervice â-but had come to no agree

THE TABLET.
" It is an infallible confcquence of all industrious profeflions,to
beget frugality, and make ihe love ofgain prevail over the love of
plcafure."
ACTIVE property usually centers in those
pla es, which art rather than nature has
made rich. There is scarce any thing more ri
diculous than for an indolent man toboaft of na
tural advantages asafource of wealth. The most
fertile foil and mildest climate will never con
fer opulence on an indolent people ; nor can
any defeat of natural resources hold an industri
ous people in poverty. That superiority which
one nation maintains over another in point of
uleful wealth, and operative strength, is the re
sult of art and industry. Men will not fnbjetft
themselves, in the firft instance, to severe labor,
unlefe their situation renders it unvoidable.
Prompted by necessity, they become industrious;
and when they are accustomed to it, they will
choose to be so from habit. When industry cea
ses to be irksome, men begin to grow rich. As
foonas the lave ofgain obtains an ascendency o
ver the love of idlenels, men will acquire more
than they have occasion to consume. Property
colle<fted in this way will seldom be expended in
folly and extravagance ; becaule if a man had
been disposed to be foolifh and extravagant, he
would not probably have been industrious. While
any one is in the habit of industry he will of
course be frugal, and by this means frugality will
likewise become an habit. The Ikill and contri
vance that grow out of experience will render
labor more productive; but the increase of ad
vantage will not abate the ardor of exertion.
Weinuft therefore look to that part of a nation
where industry is moftprevalent, for aciive
wealth, and for the best accommodations of living.

In those parts ot a country, to which nature lias
been liberal, people content themselves with few
improvements of art, because they have never been
compelled by necelfiry to rife above that indolence
of character which makes men naturally prefer
an easy life to a ufefulone.
NEWSPAPERS 'AN EXTRACT.
T WAS not a little pleased, the other day, upon
A paying a visit at the house of a person of dif
tincuon in the country, to find the family aflem
bled round a large table, covered with maps, and
globes, and books, at the upper end of which fat
a young lady, like a young profeflor, reading
from the chair. In her hand llie held a newspa
per. Ilei father told me he had long accustomed
her, while reading one of those vehicles of intelli
gence, to acquaint herfelf with thefeveral towns
and countries mentioned, by turning to the names
in Salmon's Gazetteer, and then finding them
out upon the globe, or a map ; in which Ihe was
become so great a proficient, as to be at that time
in truth giving a letfture in geography to her
younger brothers and filters. It was his farther
intention he said, that from Campbell's Present
State of Europe, Hie should acquirc a iufficient
knowledge of the history of the kingdoms around
us, as well as our own, to form an idea of their
importance and interests refpeiftively, and the
relation each bears to the reft. Verily, thought
I to myfelf, this is reading a newspaper to some
purpose.
Childnen, very early in life, are eager for the
fight of the newspaper. By being called upon
in a free and easy way, for some little account of
what is in it, they may gradually be brought to
read with attention, and to fix upon those articles
which are mod worthy of notice ; as alfe to re
member what they have read, from one day to
anot her, and put tilings together.
VV hile we are in the world we must converse
with the world ; and the conversation, in part,
will turn on the news of the day. It is the firll
fubjecfl we begin upon, as a general introduction
to every thing else. All mankind, indeed, are
our brethren, and we are intei efted, or ought to
be interested, in their pleasures and their pains,
their fufferings, or their deliverances, throughout
the world. Accounts of these (hould produce in
us suitable emotions which would tend to the ex
ercise of different virtues, and the improvement
of our tempers. We (hould accustom ourselves
hereby to rejoice with those who rejoice, and sym
pathize with those who mourn.

BRUSSELS, January 8.
AN adtion, a few days ago, was fought in the
Ardens, between the Patriotic and Imperial
troops, the former amounting to 16000 men, un
der the command of General Vander Merfch, the
latter to but 2000, commanded by either General
Dalton, or by General Bender. Yet, as another
proof, how inefficacious undisciplined valour is in
the present improved state of tadiics, General
Vander Merfch was routed, with the loss of 1 joo
men, and, as report fays, obliged to retire to
wards Nainur ; 5000 men were immediately sent
from hence to join him at Arlon, and as they
were all of them deserters from the Imperial ar
my, weil disciplined, and good soldiers, thegreat
efl: expectations are formed of their success.
LONDON, Feb. 6.
The Viceroy of Mexico has transmitted home
a packet to Spain, containing several letters, and
other papers, which had been taken out of some
English, Portuguese, and Ruffian veflels, to the
number of 36 fail, by a Spanish frigate, which
had met the said fleet in S. lat. 40 degrees, going
as is foppofed to found a colony. The Captain
of the Spanish frigate had also taken the Com
mander of the fleet.
Extratt of a letter from Ghent, of the $th January,
1790, to a gentleman in Liverpool.
"We are well advanced, and hope soon to ai
;ive at the liberty which you enjoy. Our mo
narch has done many thingslcoritrary to his oath to
the llates of the low Countries at his inauguration,
which has been proved in a proclamation made
yesterday, from a theatre ere<fted for the pur
pose in the great market place, where there met
about jo,ooo people, whose cries were all for the
states and liberty, so that we look on all to be con
cluded, and think that your court and that of
Berlin, with Holland, will interfereif neceflary."
Contrary to that idea, which gives consequence
to inoft European States, the Americans pique
themselves upon having no (landing army or hea
vy navy. They rely on their own internal
llrength for protection in cafe of war, and are,
in the mean time freed from the burthens of
permanent taxes.
They are at present employed in a great nati
onal undertaking, that of cutting through an ex
tent of 40 or 50 miles across the country, to one
of their great lakes, which will unite several
large rivers, and communicate with the Ohio, a
circumstance that will be highly favourable to
navigation and commerce.

how rapidly our resources will encreafe, and
with what facility our debts will be discharged
when they lhallonce be funded ; from that 'mo

to diminifti ; and there can be no doubt on the
mind of any unprejudiced person, that tho a pub

of property will be the consequence of funding
that will give a universal spring to industry ; & a
circulation that would not be induced from a'nv

ON THE DEATH OP
MISS CAROLINE CAMPBELL,
DAUGHTER OF THE
RIGHT HON. LORD WILLIAM CAMPBELL
(By General Conway.) '
SINCE 'tis the will of all disposing Heaven,
To fcize the boon its kinder hand had given ;
Whether thy friendly fpiritrove,
'Midst the once happy partners of thy love;
(Scenes where thy virtues reign'd, thy talents (hone>
And fond affection made each heart thy own)
Or, bounding fwift, has wing'd its airy flight
To the pure regions of eternal light;
Look down, fair Saint, and Oh, with pity fee,
Where fad remembrance lifts each thought to thee ft
Accept the heaving.sigh, the trickling tear,
The last best offerings of a heart sincere.
What though no costly hccatombs (hould
Nor lengthen'd train in fable pomp succeed ;
Yet (hall the Tweeted flowers thy grave adorn,
Waih'd by the kindliest tears of dewy morn.
There (hall each friend they heav'nly virtues made,
With picus dirge invoke thy gentle (hade ;
Like fragrant incense the (oft breath (hall rife,
And smooth thy passage to thy kindred (kies.
Severely kind, Oh, why did adverse fate
Grant such Yaft bounties with (o scant a date !
Give such sweet fragrance to this (hort liv'd flower,
The virtues of an age, to last an hoflT !
It gave her wit might grace a Mufc't tongue,
The charm of numbers, and the power of song :
Th' angelic touch toftrike the trembling firing)
And tune such notes'as its own seraphs sing.
But Oh ! o'er bounteous, with that sacred art
It gave each nicer movement to the heart;
And her foftbreaft, with strong sensation fir'd,
Felt the keen impulse which those arts infpir'd.
Too great a portion of celestial flame
Strain'd the frail texture of her weaker frame j
The subtle fire too pow'rful fore'd its way
Thro'the foft yielding mould of mortal clay;
As the clear air in chryftal prison pent,
Ok bursts its fair but brittle tenement;
While in the dust the glittering fragments lie*
The purer ether gains its native Iky.
Ere the stern fitters cut the vital thread,
1 saw, and kifs'd heron the fatal bed,
Just as her gentle spirit took its flight,
And her faint eyelids clos'd in endless night:
No strong convulsions shook her parting breath;
No tremors mark'd the cold approach of death :
Her heart still heav'd, with vital spirit warm,
And each foft feature wore its wonted charm
Ah me! in this perplexing maze of fate,
This doubtful, erring, varying reftlcfs state ;
Tho guilt with swelling fail elate (hall (leer,
With pomp and pleasure crown'd, its full career ;
Tho worth like thine no pitying power fhallfave
From sickness, pain, and an untimely grave ;
Yet (lay, rath mortal, nor presume to scan
By thy impcrfcÂ£l rule th' Almighty's plan.
Oh censure not his fovercign, high bcheit,
But proftratc own, Whatever is, is belt.
Judgment's the part of Heaven ; fubmiiHon, thine;
We may lament, but we mull not repine.
Each has his lot, (for so does Heaven ordain)
His dated share of happiness and pain;
And mortals belt its just commands fulfil,
When they enjoy the good, and patient bear the ill.
PREACHING AN EXTRACT.
THE French are certainly ourmafters in pul
pit eloquence ; and I think the obfervatians
of the Biftiop of Cambray, with respect to the
ftrudlure of sermons, are to be preferred to those
of the celebrated Blair. The former objedls a-'
gainst the pradlice of formally laying down a
number of heads, with their attendant subdivi
sions ; the latter is an advocate for it, and com
pares the heads in a sermon to the milepoftsona
journey ; " these," fays, he, " give as much ease
tothe hearer as those to the traveller." This must
i'uppofe the whole discourse painful and laborious
to the hearers,and that therefore, they rejoice
at the little retting places. Can this be compa
tible with true eloquence, which never fatigues
the hearer, and therefore requires no relling
place for him to blow, pant, or get-Jiis breath at"?
Sermons thus fabricated and laid down, accord
ing to Mr. Blair's plan, with seven heads a;fd tcu
horns, will never cease to be ftifF, cold, tedious,
and phlegmatic. It ismuch better for the preach
er to reserve than apprise the audience of the
lieads of his discourse ; for, when once they are
lurnifhed with them,'they begin to. anticipate
â¢what is to be said upon the fubjedt, and then take
anap tothemfelvcs ; but,where we are not iit once
presented with a chart or draught of the sermon,
the pleasure of novelty, which isconftantly break
ing in upon us, commands attention.

MY Lor.l),
" Public report accuses you of aspiring to the
.lirotie * You no longer fear the Kingâperhaps
because you fee that he is almost destitute of pow
er. You may pollibly imagine, after the scene of
Monday (the 9th of Odiober,) when the soldiers,
deaf to the voice of their commanders, united
with an hireling mob, rn order to force me to
head them to Versailles, that I am no longer an
objetfl to be dreaded. I however forwarn you,
that you will find in me your greatest adversary.
No perfotr has flruggled with greater courage
than I have against arbitrary power ; 110 perlon
has bestowed more applause than I have on the
wile attempts of the National Aflembly to efface it,
even to its last vestige-âbut as much as I have ex
erted myfelf in the deftrudion of despotism, so
much will 1 still exert myfelf for the preservati
on to the king-os the lawful power which he has
received from the hands of the nation, the secu
rity of which is necessary to him for the mainte
nance of the laws and public tranquility. You
deceive yourfelf if you believe that a flare of ac
tual anarchy will be favorable to your views. I
defy you to derive any advantage, either by usurp
ing the public force, or by dividing and render
ing it useless. The moment that you declare
yourfelf to a mob at hand, all the citizens and
soldiers will flock to my llandard, because the
natives of France will have fortlieir chief a King,
and not an Usurper.
" Without pretending to predidt the catastro
phe of this event, I dare to inform you, that the
iituation of affairs is such, that it can only termi
nate three waysâeither I lliall lose my head, or
you will lose yours, or you muit quit the king
dom."

the State. Yon have thought, and you may per

deathâYou will then be the King of the mob
for three days, and on the fourth yourdeath will
revenge mine. I therefore think you would a<ft
with mofl prudence in quitting the kingdom."

chosen by the people, to be clad in a white lobe
or garment, denoting the purity of their morals,
whence from the Latin word Candidus (Dihite)vit
derive the word Candidate. Would it not be
better if this matter was a little more attended

it indispensably neceilary that he should have the
