THE TABLET
Â« Thefuffrage of thofc who arc shy and backward in giving
p.aifc, is attended with an additional rel.fh and enjoyment.
MY last number offered fonte remarks on the
caution that should be used in the choice
of confidential friends. It is of nolefs importance
to be flow and diffident in bellowing commenda
tions on persons or anions. There is no species
of indiscretion that men oftener hr-.-e orcafion to
repent of, than pnffing to. hasty a on
the charadlersandincidents that areprelented to
their view. One inconvenience of falling into
an habit of judging prematurely is, that it ren
ders an opinion suspicious, even in those inftan
ces, where it may be well-founded Applause,
conferred by a person who speaks much and thinks
little, affords no delight to a man of a found un
demanding. We cannot reafonablybe plealed
â¢with approbation, unlel's we are conscious of de
serving it; and when it conies from a man who is
rash and unguarded in his expressions, it does
not brighten our reputation, and should not gra
tify our feelings. When men are cautious of
wjvLng praise, if they are likewise modeftin their
censures, we muftafcribe it to pi udence and de
licacy. This kind ot reserve may sometimes re
sult from a cold heart, but whatever may be the
cause of it, the person who poflefles it, will com
mand attention and i-efpetft. Prudence, by no
means, requires a forbidding afpedi in our man
ners ; but it prohibits a forward, impudent one.
A stem demeanor is better than a frivolous
but both should be avoided. That mildness of
behavior that makes men amiable is not incom
patible with the ftriifteft propriety of conduit,
gr with a most cautious reserve in giving opinions.
Mirth and gaiety may be indulged ; but there
can be no weight of character without reflection
and (bbiiety.
Those tliouglitlefs men who condemn where
there is 110 fault, and praise whete there is no
merit, will gain little confidence in the world.
Ccnfurc as wÂ»JI as applaule, to have any effect,
must not appear to be indiscriminate. It should
aim at a particular point, and be directed by juit
views. Ifto avoid a charge of ill nature a man
becomes insincere, he betrays weakness ; and if
a delire to {hew an independent spirit makes nim
censorious, it is psrverfenefs, No man will wifli
the applause, or fear the censure of him, who is
accuflomed to bestow extravagant encomiums 011
indifferent adlions, or to heap reproaches on inno
cent ones. Modefl men are those whole praise
has a charm, and wliofe reproof has a fling.
Bold, afl'uming characters are never highly es
teemed by any ; and people only treat them with
civilities to avoid tlie trouble of a quarrel.
r once knew a lioify, impertinent coxcomb run
into extravagant applause. at the performance o
a fiddler. A discreet by-ftander, obfervmg such
profufe compliments thrown away 011 so trifling
a rharatfter, said, " what encomiums might not a
man of real excellence expert, when a low mufi
eian is praised so lavishly ?'

Mr. Boudinont declared far his own part, he never blamei
hem for flandingforth for what 'hey conceived the true interest

wen done, that he complained tfr. .
On resolutions declaring that Congrefj had not power to prohi
lit the importation of flaws into any state, or intcrlcnng 111 then
mancipation or internal govt rnment, l<>ng arguments had beet
ifed and much precious time had been spent ; to prove the law
ulnefs of the African trade in slaves. This indeed was an ardu
.us talk in this day of light and knowledgeâan author said to bi
if reputation, was brought forward to prove the state of that un
iappy country, but it turned out to be in the 15th century , thi:
ould be of little availâan hour was taken up in reading the la.
lorsof a newspaper writer in the illand of Jamaica. This write:
ppeared wholy mifintormed as to historic facts relating to thÂ«
inferable Africans, and as ignorant of the principal arguments a
ainft the slave trade. It was nectffary for him to deny the au.
hority of Anthony Benezet, who had published some point"
afls on this fubieft. Mr. Benezet was a man of the ftrittelt in
egrity and of the best information-a man that was an honor tt
lis country and an ornament to society. Mr. Boudinot had beet
veil acquainted with him and spoke from personal knowledge
.e had examined into the facts from captains of Guineamen, ant
person who had lived twelve years in that country, and he coult
ay with confidence, that Mr. Benezet's account had been ge
1 orally confirmed. Not only the praftife of ancient nations, ant
hat of all modern Europe had been brought into view, but eve.
he fat-red fcripturcs had been quoted to juftify this iniquitoustraf
,c It is true that the Egyptians held the Israelites in bondage
or 400 years, and Mr. Boudinot doubted not, but much the sam
rguments as had been uied on the present occafian, had bee.

xprefsly said, had been extremely hardened, to (hew why h

lienable right! : that among these arellifte t liberty, and the pur

This then is the language of America in the day of distress.
Mr. Chairman, I would not be understood, to contend the rigfct
of Congress at this time to prohibit the importation ot slaves,
whatever might have been the principles of the revolution or the
genius of the government â¢, by the present confutation we are
hrrby artd pofiti**f!y restrained till the year 1808, and I am lure
that no gentleman in thij commiitee would have the moll distant
wish to wound this ittftrurrleot of our conneftioh
But there is a wide difference 1 between jitftifjung this ungrner
cms traffic and supporting a claim to property, verted at the time
of the Constitution, and guaranteed thereby. Besides it would be
inhumanity itfelf to turn these Unhappy people loflfe to murder
each other, or to perilh for want of the tteceflaries of life. I ne
ver was an advocate for so extravagant a conduct. â¢
Many arguments were pointed against the dangei' of our emanr
cipating these Oaves, or even holding up an idea that we had
a power so to doâand much time has been taken up to disprove
this right in Congress. As no claim of this kind is contended for,
and, the resolutions already pa (Ted ex.refsly contitdift it. I thall
make no farther observations on them.
But the characters of the signers of theft memorials are called
in question, as an argument against the adoption of the rtfolutioft
on the table. One of these memorials was signed by the society
of people called Quakers ; the other by Dr. Franklin, as President
of a private society in Philadelphia. The lndifcrimiaau: abufc
that has been thrown out agamft the Quakerj without diftiuftion,
has not comported with the honor or dignity of this haute. Not
only their characters, but their very names have been called upon,
and private anecdotes relating to individuals been mentioned on
the floor. Many of the Quakers 1 have long lived in In habits
of friendfh.p with, and can teftify to the refpeftability of _ their
characters and the regularity of their lives. Their conduct in the
late war has been arraigned, and they have been condemned in
the lump. 1 have known many of them during the war, and im
partial iuftice requires it from me, to give the committee some o -
fecial information on thefubjeft; I had the honor of ferrmg the
United States at the commencement of the war, as Coi&miUary
General of Prisoners. Congress not being able to afford ihem
Cupplies, those unhappy men in this town, were reduced to the
Â«rv depths of distress, without food or raiment, without blan
kets or firing, they fuffered every thing that human nature could
i>ear In thfs (ituation many of the Quakers of this city, exerciU
â¢d such humanity towards them, as did honor to human nature.
The miserable prisoner, not only telt the happy effects of their
ixertions in his favor, but participated of their money, their food
ind cloathing. Nay,fuch were the jealoufics created by thiscon*
lust in the British army here, that an armed force entered the
louse of one of them, feited hir books, and though a man of
â reat property and large commercial drahng., on finding mat
'â ad loaned large sums of money to our distressed prisoners, he
vasturnedo.it of their lines, and with his family was ai retugee
luring the whole of the war afterwards, separated from his bel
iefs and property. . .
To whom was the care of our prisoners in Philadelphia com
nitted ? To a Quaker ; and 1 have been witness to thejutt tribute
,f gratitude and thanklulnefs paid by great numbers of our unhap
iv fellow-citizens to that gentleman, for his kindness and huma
nly And is this indiscriminate charge, without the r<ef
,eft'to characters, a decent or a just return for a conduct like
his? Where is the denomination amongst us, that didnot turnilh
.ppofers to our glorious Revolution? Were not hundreds of
â¢refbyterians, Episcopalians. and almost of every other denomi
iation, among our enemies ? What denominations formed the
houfands of new levies, that endeavored to deluge our country
n blood? On the other hand, were not a Greene and a Mifflin
urnifhed from the society of the Quakers ?
In (hort, I rejoice to fay that out cause was not carried on by
anaticfm or .eligiousreal, but a generous ftrugglc for the right,
,f human nature. Then why all this abuse of this particular feti,
vithoutdifcrimination ? Can any sol.d argument agamft the re
olution on the table, anfef.om a conduct of this kind.âl am at
, loss to know what other argument has been used to Ihew he
impropriety of the resolution before you. It goes to declare the
jower of Congress to prohibit foreigners from fitting ont velTels
n our pons, to supply foreigners with (laves from Africa For
Tiv part, 1 think it a prudent a humane and a conftnutional refo
ution. It will render further interference on this fubteft, per
laos unneceftary, when it is known that the power of Congress
:xtends to rem Jy the evil. They will hardly venture to nfk a
royage that may be ruiued before its being finithed.

of the town of Portsmouth, N. H. brought in a
report which was read.
A committee, consisting of Mr. Boudinot, Mr.
Goodhue, and Mr. Huntington, was appointed to
bring in a bill for the mitigation of penalties and
forfeitures, pursuant to a motion laid on the ta
ble yesterday.
The order of the day being called for on the
report of the -Secretary of the Treasuryâ Mr
Fnzfimons said, he wished a suspension of the
motion while he read a proposition which he
meant to offer for the confederation of the house ;
It was 111 fubftanceas followsâviz. That a Com
mittee be appointed to devise a plan for the as
sumption of the debts, payable by the refpe<ftiv e
Statesâand a mode of paying the interelt there
onâ also to provide for the speedy and effectual
settlement of accounts between the United States
and individual States.

To GEORGE WASHINGTON, President of the
United States.
The Address of the Religious Society of Free-Qiia
kers.
\\JE beg leave to join the general voice in the
VV mod refpeftful congratulation 011 thy ap
pointxneiit to the highest oiÃce, and inoft extend
ed trust \vhic.h can be confided by a free people ;
a trust which the force of precedent in the firft
exercise of the supreme executive authority, at
the founding of such an empire, renders infinite
ly important, not to its immediate citizens only,
but to every part of mankind, who have an in
terest in the firm establishment of religious and
civil liberty.
We offer no apology for the time of this ad
dress, as decency required, that theyoungeft re
ligious society in the empire, should give place
to those that are more numerous and of far more
ancient establishment; yet fpringingup with and
growing out of the revolution, it is our duty on
this great occasion to appear among our fellow
citizens ; and we feel a dignity in declaring, that
â we have reason to believe there is not a member
of our religious society who has not at all times
and on all occasions, relied 011 and confided in
thy patriotiftn, prudence, and virtue.
Many of our members having been educated
Quakers, admitted the do<ftrine declared by that
people, of a state attainable here, in which a chri
ltian cannot be concerned in wars and fightings
of any kind ; yet, thÂ«y perceived the wisdom and
soundness of the diftinftion, made by the apolo
gist of that people, when he expressly declares,
that until men attain that state they " cannot be
undefending themselves." They indeed saw, that
by availing themselves of the profeffion held out
by that society, they might have palled uncen
fured by the world; but being; accountable to
GodNfor their condudl as individuals, they dare
not in a cafe of luch boundlefsconfequence, reft
themselves on the profeffion of any body of men
whatever.
They saw, that in discharging the great duty
they were called upon to perform, infupport of
their own civil rights and that of our country
and posterity, they would probably be disowned
bv that people ; and there was no means of re
taining or recovering their rights among them ;
but by neglecting that duty or by publicly con
demning their conducft in the difcliaree of ic; a
treachery to the cause of liberty and truth of
which they feel themselves utterly incapable.
They were not unaware of the alienation of
friendfhip, and many other injurious effetfs on
temporal affairs, which too commonly attend of
fence given by individuals, to a body so numer
ous as the Quakers are, and of such weight in
civil society ; but in the course of Divine Provi
dence, they were called to make so great a facri.
sice and they obeyed.
They perceived the advantage of religious foci
ciety, and being desirous of obtaining it, united
together in such a body. They had felt the evil
of undue restraint on the consciences of men,and
determined, if pollible, to leave their members
free : They therefore founded our society on the
enlarged and Catholic principles of the gospel,
appealing to the leflonsof wisdom and virtue left
us by Christ and his apoflles, as the best exter
nal rule of faith and practice, and leaving every
man to answer to God, to his own conscience,
and to the government for his conduct. And be
ing formed on this ground, weafk no extraordi
nary or special privilege ; but having discharged
a common duty, ;rnd being determined to pay a
due obedience to the laws, we claim the common
protection of that government.
Far from repining at our Sufferings, we have
rejoiced in the triumph of liberty overjdefpotifm ;
and exulted in the praise which our fellow-citi
zens havebeftowed on themeafures which led to
success ; they are jultly styled glorious ; but it is
that undeviating steadiness of mind, and invaria
ble regard to the rights of the people, that have
so honorably distinguished thy concJu<fl on such
varied and trying occasions, which lead us to a
'full confidence that thy adminiftiation will, in
deed, tend to make liberty more secure than it
ever before has been ; and we feel, that it is this
confidence which gives the unusual glow to con
gratulation from every quarter, on this happy
occasion.
The profpedl of a union which will embrace
all who contended for the cauie of freedom, is
highly plealing to us ; and we beg leave to add
our most cordial congratulation on the high ho
nors which have been so deservedly bellowed by
the nation of France on thy illustrious pupil the
Marquis la Fayette : We trust, that it will be a
brilliant and lasting honor ro Ameiica that her
conduct has inspired the world with the most no
ble emulation in support of liberty and the com
mon cause of mankind.
May that Supreme Being which rules in Hea
ven and among men, continue to pour his wildom
into thy heart, and Co guide thy administration
as to make the government a bl effing td the peo-
pie, and render it free, efficient andftaMe. And
to whatever length of days he shall please to ex
tend thy life to a purpole so eminently impor
tant, may thine eye never become dim nor thy
natural force abate. And finally, when the great
talk shall be fully compleated, and thou flialt ad
vance into that Hate which is the end and highest
glory of our being, may thine inheritance be a
-111 ong the fpiritsof just men made perfect."

THE ANSWER.
To the Members of the Religious Society of Free- Qtia
kefs.
Gentlemen,
I desire to afl'ure you of the sensibility with
which I receive your congratulations 011 my ap
pointment to the highest office and most extend
ed trust which can be confided by a tree people ;
and I thank you with sincerity for the obliging
terms in which you express yourfiplvcs in my be
half.
Ever happy in being favored with the approba
tion of my fellow citizens, the time at which
yours is declared does not diininifh my sense of
the obligation it confers.
Having always considered the confcieutious
scruples of religious belief as retting entirely
with the fedis that profefs, or the individuals
who entertain them, I cannot consistent with this
uniform sentiment otherwise notice the circuin
ltances referred to in your address, than by ad
ding the tribute of my acknowledgment to that
of our country, for thofel'ervices which the mem
bers of your particular community rendered to J
the common cause in the course ot our revoluti
on ; and by alluring you that as our prefeut go
vernment was instituted with an express view to
general happiness, it will be my earnest endea
vor, in discharging the duties confided to me
with faithful impartiality, to realize the hope of
common protection, which you expect from the
measures of that government.
Imprefled with gratitude for your Applicati
ons to the Supreme Being in my favor, 1 entreat
his gracious beneficence in your behalf.

A TRIP TO GRETNA GREEN.
On Monday last Miss P , ofT 11, in
Yorkshire, a young lady of exquisite beauty and
sensibility, with a fortune of thirty thousand
pounds, eloped to Gretna Green with Mr. C, li
nen draper of D , in the fame county, a
gentleman, allowed by all statuaries, who have
had the pleasure of feeinghim, to be the best pro
portioned and fiiielt figure of a man in the king- I
dom, being upwards of fix feet high, and of the
exadteft fyminetry.
There is a very remarkable circumstance at
tending the marriage :
Mr. C was to have been united to Miss Gâ,
of Wakefield, and Miss P to Mr. Gâ, brother
to Miss Gâ, the fame day being appointed for
both weddings ; but, what is melancholy to re
late, Mr. and Miss Gâ both died a few days pre
vious to the time fixed for their foleinnization.
It was at the funeral of their refpediive Lovers
that this present couple firft met ; there being a
fitnilarity in their cases, a fymphathizing attach
ment immediately took,place, and they were mar
ried within the month.
FKOM THE MORNING CHRONICLE.
DERBY, Feb. 3.
At Burton fair yesterday morning a young wo
man of the parilh of Sadlincote, whole liulband
fonietime since ablconded, and who, on that ac-
count has been chargeable to the parilh, was pub
licly fold in the market place, by the Sadlincote
parilh officer, to a man of the parilh of Grealley,
for the fuin of2s, deducting the price of the hal
ter in which the woman was delivered, in the u
sual way which has been lately pra&ifed. After
entering the tranfaftion in the toll book, the par
ties returned home seemingly fatisfied. What
are the magiltrates that fufter such practices !
It is llightly,and with great caution whispered,
in very high life, that a willi has been intimated
that a few young ladies of the inoft eminent rank
Ihould marry into the principal families of the
Englilh nobility. Such a measure can only be
accomplished by authority of an a<fl of Parlia
ment, and the attempt would, undoubtedly, pro
duce much political disputation. But it is indeed
to be regretted, that so many beautiful and amia
ble females, like flowers within light and out of
reach, poflefs virtues in vain, and
" Waftc their sweetness on the desert air."
We hear from Bury, that the Rev. H. Dannett
has inoculated gratis upwards or 1300 poor chil
dren in that town and neighbourhood. It is re
markable,that not one out ot so great a number un
der his care, have fallen a facrifice to that loath
some disease. 1 his circumstance ought to recom
mend the praiftice of inoculation to the general
attention of the poor, who have the happiness to
live within the circuit of this gentleman's bene
volence and humanity, and whom, at no small
fhai e of fatigue and expence, he has long invited
424
o partake of its beneficial effects without any
other reward, than the felf conl'ciouftiefsof down
good, and abating the virulence of a disorder io
universally incident to the human frame.
INDICATION OF A HARD WINTER.
PRevioufty to the fettingin of a severe winter,
nature,in her bounty,has been al wa\ s observed
to have provided an uncommon store of wildlniar
fruits, as a nauriftiment to the smaller birds, who
would otherwise perifli, a vail carpet of (now
spreading itfelf over the ground, lb as to prevent
their coming at the worms, &c. on which they
are accustomed to feed.
