THE TABLET
Â«'An uublemithed charaflcr gives great weight to the arguments of
a public fpcaker."
A S the main design of public speaking is to
ii. convince an audience of" the truth and impor
tance of what is spoken, men frequently Itrive
to effect this purpose by addingfome adventitious
force to the intrinsic merit of their speeches. It is
commonly supposed that the best method to make
forcible imprellions on a public assembly, is to
display an elegant, spirited elocution. Senti
ments may be decorated with such brilliant,ner
vous expressions ; arranged in a manner to
give such a fine harmony of cadence, and pro
nounced with such grace and energy, as to in
spire the mind with all the fafcination of music.
But the powers of persuasive oratory belong only
to a few. And even where a person poliefles
them in the fulleft extent, they will not always
procure, much less preserve a substantial influence.
A graceful elocution may retaiffits charms, and
excite applause, long after the orator hiinfelf has
ceased to be viewed with relpetft, and loit all his
weight of reputation. It is one thing to be amu
sed, and another to be convinced by the allure
ments of rhetoric. Men do not fufficicntly con
template that it is better to be believed than ad
mired.
The success that attended the l'peeches offome
of the antient orators is generally afci ibed to
their extraordinary powers of eloquence. This
is an opinion that deserves examination. Itfhould
not too hastily be concluded that those speakers
derived their influence, solely from the superior
excellence of their oratory. The popularity
which mere eloquence begets can have 110 long
duration, unless itis supported by avirtuouscha
rafter. Virtue renders an eloquent man irrefu
table. Themoft celebrated orators of antiquity,
it may be presumed, were not less diftinguiflied
for levcre morals, than for splendid eloquence.
They excited a general belief, by the uniform te
nor of their condurt, that they were actuated by
the mod generous sentiments of patriotism. It
cannot be doubted but the aftoni/hing effects of
their oratory were owing very much to the
honest zeal, which their acftions discovered for
the honor and welfare of their country.
Purity of principles, both in public and private
life, is the bed foundation on which to ere<ft a
public chara<fier. This will not perhaps attract
l'o much notice, or meet with so much flattery, as
eloquence ; but it will gain more real influence,
and inspire more confidence. Splendor of talents
may be gazed at, and admired, but unless they
are united with unblemilhed morals they will not
long be refpecfted. I hose whose opinions are
molt regarded,and whose advice the mod pursued,
are not men of the nioft captivating abilities.
(/i avity of temper and sobriety of manners will
lender moderate talents ufeful and refpeftable.
It niuft be confefled that the art of oratory is
highly worthy of cultivation, and an accomplished
speaker has an advantage over those whose elo
cution is imperfect and diiagreeable. But perfec
tion in eloquence should not make men indiffer
ent to solid attainments, and ufeful virtues. No
force of capacity, no glare of acquirements can
compenlate for a stain 011 tlie moral character. If
an eloquent man shews a levity of deportment,the
hearers may to be sure compliment him for speak
ing charmingly, but they will declare, he does
not hirufelf believe a word of what he is flying. If
his principles are fufpe<fted, or his manners licen
tious, his eloquence may still be applauded ; but
those who hear him, will express their fori ow,
that a man who can speak so well, Jliould ast so per
vet fly. In fhortjtlie world will learn 10 be guarded
against the seducing effetfts of his rhetoric ; and
it will afford much amusement, while it can pro
'luce 110 convi<ftion. Personal influence muftgive
man Jiis principal weight in public life; and
no one will long maintain personal influence,
Without a fair, unblemished character.

LQMDUM.
HOUSE of LORDS,
January r6.
The Lords resolved to proceed in the trial of
Warren Haltings, Esq. on Monday the lit of Fe
bruary.
Javuary 21.
This day his Mujelly went inftateto the House
of Peers, and opened the bufineli of the present
session of Parliament, by the following molt gra
cious speech from the throne :
My Lords and Gentlemen,
Since I last met you in Parliament, the contin
uance of the war on the Continent, aud the in
ternal condition of different parts of Europe, have
been productive of events which have engaged
my most serious attention.
While 1 fee, with a just concern, the interrup
tion of the tranquility of other countries, I have
at the fame time great fatisfaction in being able
to inform you, that I receive continual afluran
ces of the good disposition of all foreign powers
towards these kingdoms ; and I am persuaded
that you will entertain with me a deep and grate
ful sense of the favor of providence, in continu
ing to my fubjetfts the increasing advantages of
peace, and the uninterrupted enjoyment of those
invaluable blessings which they have so lono- de
rived from our excellent conltitution.
Gintlemcn o fth: Motife of Commons,
I have given directions that the estimates for
the present year should be laid before you, and I
rely on your readiness to grant such supplies as
the circuinftances of the several branches of the
public service may be found to require.
My Lords and Gentlemen,
The regulations prescribed by the act of the last
feflion of Parliament, relative to the corn trade,
not having been duly carried into effett in several
parts of the kingdom, there appeared reason to
apprehend that such an exportation of corn might
rake place, and such difficulty arise in the import
ation of foreign corn, as would have been pro
duttive of the most serious inconvenience to my
fubjetfts. Under these circumstances, itappeared
nbfolutely neceflary to take immediate and effec
tual measures for preventing the exportation, and
facilitating the importation of particular forts of
corn ; I therefore, by the advice of my Privy
Council, illued an order for that purpose, a copy
of which 1 have directed to be laid before you.
I have only further to desire, that you will con
tinue to apply yourselves to those objects which
may require your attention, with the fame zeal
for the pubjic service which has hitherto appear
ed in all your proceedings, and of which the ef
fects have been so happily manifefted by an in
crease of public revenue, the extension of the
commerce and raanufatftures of the country, and
the general of my people.
The waited upon his Majesty
with their address, which was as usual the echo
of the speech, his Majesty was gracioiifly pleased
to return the followinganfwer :

CONGRESS.
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
SATURDAY; MARCH t 3 .
The following /hovld hne preceded Mr. Girry'sfpeech in ourhjl.
ATr. Am ls : The word irredeemable is made the fubjeftof ob
-IVX jection. It isfaid toconveyadifagrceableidea.and to tend to
excite popular prejudice against the debt, as it implies that the
public agrees to be saddled with a prrpetiial burden of debt. Irt
a land of ignorance, where the people are not in the habit, and
have not the capacity to reason, it may be proper to pay regard to
this objection. I have too much reverence for the sober thinking
people whom we reprelent, to believe, that the mere found of this
word will work mifchief, when their own enquiries willconvmce
them that the substance is not only unexceptionable, but highly be
ncncial. Â® 7
Making the debt redeemable will not redeem if. It puts not a
farthing iri the creditor's pocket: Making it btedeemaile is no re
straint upon the present or probable capacity of the public to re
deem. It will not prolong the evil of a public debt a Angle day,
but rather the contrary. All the money that can be provided for
paying off the debt may (till be employed for the purpose, th'o the
niedeemable quality should remain.
1 he proposal to make the debt irredeemable is founded on the
supposed gradual reduition of interest. But until the reduaion
has actually hippened in a fhorler period, or in a greater degree
than is calculated, the paper will not bear a higher price than 100
per cent While the debt is at par, or below par, the creditors will
not relule to receive their money, the public has also the right
to redeem at the rate of one per cent, against their will. But the
value will not rifeto par while the rate of intercft keeps up : The
government will therefore have full employment for all itsfurpluj
revenue to buy up the paper at a discount, Surely, the govern
ment will not squander the public monev to redeem the debt at
per, when it is to be purchased at a discount. The latter is even
more advantageous to the creditors. Buying at the market price
in latt raises the price, and benefits those who do not fell. The
greater the discount, the more paper a given sum will buy, and take
out of the market. This not only raises the price, but increases
the security of the unfold part; In these three ways, there is full
excrcife forthe power of redemption, nor can it be supposed, that
the redeemable quality of the debt will increase the capacity of the
public to redeem, or fhotten the duration of the debt. The con.,
trary may be proved by attending to these facts.
The government in consideration of makingthedebt irredeema
ble is allowed 19 per cent. 100 dollars are to be lent; and 81 only
to be iunded, The aggregate of the sums saVed to the public by
this 19 per cent, linear 13 millions. The public is therefore paid
beforehand tor not ledecnvng; The right renounced is valuable
to the creditors, as it has been formerly shewn, but of no value to
the public. For the right to redeem is worth nothing, if the pub
lic has not the means to redeem j and if money can be found, it
appears that it can be better employed to buy up the debt than to
pay off. The capacity of the public is laid under no restraint. So
tar trom it, 13 millions will be already redeemed. Perhaps in a
dozen years the public would not pay off that amount; and if it
Ihould prove able, it will have 20 years according to the principles
ot the Report to buy ftodc on better terms than paying off. Those
who fay we can redeem fader, and will not be fatisfied with the
argument I have jull urged, will pleale to remember that by mak
ing the entire debt redeemable, we ihall have more to redeem
with an imaginary increase of the power will be an actual increase
ot the talk to be performed. But will any one soberly assert that
the public will probably have thc.connnand of more money than
â t can find perlons willing to accept tor their Hock; and unless
this is alfcrtcd, and really believed, I am sure the word irredeema
ble will not be ftruckout.
If then it is no burden to the public, is it any disadvantage to
the creditor ? If the debt is below par, the public will buy stock,
and will not pay off the capital. It at par, the creditor will not
thank government to do what he may get any individual, and inevery great town, to Jo. If the debt fliould fell for more than
par, it would be a loss to reccivc a less ium than the market price.
This indeed is not to be fpcedily expe&ed. In every view of the
fubk et, t!ic advantage to the creditor of making the debt redeem
able ;s merely delulivc.
Still it will be asked, if no good will flow from (hiking out this
word, will any reiukjrom retaining it ?
What is our objc& ? To establish public creditâand that is
found when the stock will fell at par The price ofrUock will de
pend upon the quantity offered to iale, fend the demand.
In order to raise the price we mud provide means .therefore to
increafc the demand ; our own market for (lock is a limited oneâ
our citizens poifefs litile adtive property, and that little is fully
employed in adlive purluits, and bears an higher interell than go
vernment proposes to give ; we Anuot ex peek that a poor market
will give credit to a great debtâwe mull regard the great market
-the trading and monied worldâto qualify the (lock tor the
great European market, ic mud be made irredeemable ; interell is
low in Europe and high in America, but even an higher interell
than fix per cent, would not compcufatc the European if the pro
perty purchased wants permanency. For if he has lix per cent,
ior one or two years only, the charge of inlurance agency, See.
â would reduce the net profit of his money below what he could get
for it in Europe, where it would be under his eye, and fubje6l to
his controulâyou must give him a kind of estate, a freehold in
the fundsâfoi so long as he fears that you will borrow money and
pay off his debt, after he has received interell a year or two, he
â¢will not buy stock at par. He will not deal in property which
will yield a good intcreft, but of uncertain duration. It the debt
ihould pass at par, it will be easy to borrow money in Europeâ
becaufethe price will be a proot of the good ilate of our credit,
and nothing but credit is wanting to enable us to borrow abroad.
In propoition as it may be eaf/ for us to borrow on better terms
than fix per cent, the buyers will have more cause to consider the
debt as an improper fubjett of their permanent arrangements.
The reasons already urged will evince that if there should beadif
inclination abroad to poiTcfs our (lock, it will be liable to a reduc
tion of value.
It is urged that the debt if it shall be fold to foreigners, will be
a drain of our wealth to foreign countries. This merits examina
tion ; I have already endeavored to Ihew that the debt if not fuit
cd to the foreign market by being made irredeemable will pass
below par.âA great discount will hold out the itrongeft induce
ments to foreigners to purchaseâthey will buy more and for less
discount will fully compensate the redemption, and thisdif
count will be so much lofsto the country. If then the drain of
our wealth to pay interest to foreigners, is an evil, this will aggra
vate the evil.
More will go out of the countiy, and less will be brought in to
pay for it ;we cannot help foreigners dealing in our funds. While
our debt has any value, thofc who can bed afford to run rifles *nll
deal in it. But if they will buy it, let us prevent their getting it
for a trifle ; let us make them pay for it. If they buy at par or
near it, it may bequeftioned whether their purchases will be in
juriousâbaniih all doubts of your funds, and the sales will regu
late themfelvcs, when our citizens can better fparethe property to
buy flock then foreigners, they will buy it.âlt is bringing mat
ters to the test of experience whether the money can be employed
more ufcfully in that or some other way. If a man can get more
for his money than flock yields, it fecins to be th interest of the
nation to import money at 4 percent, and employ its own at a
higher rate. This is rather making a drain of foreign property in
to our own country than the contrary. It is not to be forgotten
that in the competition between American and loreign purchasers,
the former will constantly have the advantageâfor the latter as has
be n before mentioned, will have agency and other charges to pay.
We may expett \herefore that the property paid by foreigners for
our stock will *ielda greater profit and be more ufefully employed
in the country theilock itfelf. It is true that interest will be
paid to 11 rangers-âbut it is deducinlc from the principles which I
have endeavored to establish that the property paid by them for
stock will yield a profit more than fuflicient to pay itâin that cafe
as a nation we shall gainâlt is probable too that a great portion
of the interest mÂ«ncy due to foreigners will be flopped in the
country to buy articles, as these will bear an advantage in Europe,
but money will be fubjeÂ£t to the deduction of inlurance and other
charges.
If ihc purchases of (lock by foreigners should however, Rill be
considered as injurious, let it be repeated that the motion in de
bate furnifhes no remedy tor the evilâfor the greater the discount
the more they will purchafe.âWc cannot prevent their buyingâ
all that remains foi us to do, is to oblige them to pay for what
they purchase by giving a fixed and high value to the debt. This
we aretold will swell the wealth of (lock-jobbers. Thole who
make a science of {peculation are gainers by the fluduating Hate of
funds. To banish speculation give as certain a value as possible to
your stock. My own belief is thatthefe things will be found ne
ccifarv to effect this objed, a national bank,an ample linking fund,
and considerable falcs ot ilock to foreigners. It is allowed that the
irredeemable quality of llock fits it for the last purpose, and as the
itation is well paid for it by the 19 per cent, on the capital,andwill
gain more as the Hock lhall fell for moreâas it lays no restraint
upon the application of all its surplus revenue to extinguish the
<lebr, and will not incrcafe the supposed evil of falcs of stock to
foreigners, and as it will prove mutually beneficial to the nation
ancf its creditors, it is iny delire that the word irredeemable may
not be ftrickeu out.
WEDNESDAY, MARCH 17
Mr. Smith's (S. C.) Speech on the report of the Committee on themcmotial
of the People called Quakers.
Mr. Smith (S. C.) laid he lamented much that this fubjed had
been brought before theHoufeâthat he had deprecated it from the
beginning because he forefaw that it would produce a very unplea
Â£mt difcuflionâthat it was a fubjed of such nature as to excite the
alarms of the fouthe? 11 members who could not view, without
anxiety, any interference in it on the part of Congress. He re
marked, that as they were resolved into a committee of the whole
on the powers of Congress refpeding flavcry, and the Have-trade,
in confcqucuce of certain memorials from the people called Qua
kers and the Pennsylvania society for the abolition of flavcry, the
whole fubjed, as well as the contents of those memorials, was un
der conlideration : he should therefore enter into the business at
large and offer forae comments on the contents of the memorials.
The memorials from the Quakers contained, in his opinion, a
very indecent attack on the chara&erof those States which porfef
fed slaves ; it repiobated slavery as bringing down rcproach on the
4'outhern States, and expatiated on the detcftation due to the li
centious wickedness of the African trade, and the inhuman tyran
ny, and blood-guiltincfs inseparable from it. He could not but
consider it as calculated to fix a stigma of the blackest nature on
the chara&er of the State he had the honor toreprefent, and to hold
its citizens up to public view as men divifted of every principle of
honor and humanity. Confidcring it in that light, he felt it in
cumbent on him not only to refute those atrocious calumnies, but
to relent the improper language made use of by the memoriaiifts.
Before he entered into the difcuflion he begged to observe, that
when anvclafs of men deviated from their own religious princi
ples, and officiouAy came forward in a bufmefs with which they
had no concern, and attempted to di&ate to Congress, he could
not ascribe their conduct to any other cause, but to an intolerant
spirit of pcrfecution : this application came with the worst grac#
poflible from the Quakers, whoprofefled never to intermeddle in
politics, but to submit quietly to the laws of the country.
He had met with a publication which came out in the year
1 775 ( at a period when the affairs of America were in a very des
ponding fiiuation) entitled, " The ancient Testimony and Princi
ples of the Quakers." It let forth that their religious principles
retrained them from having any hand or connivance in up
and pulling down Kings and governments ; that this was
peculiar prerogative forcaufcs best known to himfelf ; that it was
not their buiinefs to be busy bodies above their Rations, but only
to pray tor the King and fufety ot their nation, that they might
live a quiet and peaceable life, under the government which God
was pleased tofetover them. If these were really their feiltimenis,
why did they not abide by them ? Why did they not leave that, 1
which they call God's work,to be managed by himfelf? Thofc prin
ciples (hould inftrtiS them to wait with patience and humility for
the event of all public measures, and to receive that event as thj
Divine Will : Their conduit on this occasion proved, that they
did not beiieve what they profeffed, or that they had not virtue
enough to pra&ife what they believed. Did they mean to rob the
Almighty of what they call his prerogative ? And were they not
partial ministers of their own acknowledged principles? It was
difficult to credit their pretended scruples; because, while they
were exclaiming against the Mammon of this world, they were
hunting after it with a itcp steady as time, and an appetite keen as
the grave.
The memorial from the Pennsylvania society, applied in express
terms for an emancipation of slaves, and the report ot the com
mittee appeared to hold out the idea that Congress might exercise
the power of emancipation after the year 1808; for it fÂ«id that
Congress could not emancipate slaves prior to that period. He
remarked that either the power of manumiflion still remained with
the several States, or it was exclulively veiled in Congress ; for no
one would contend that such a power could be concurrent in the
several States and the United States. He then lhewed that the
State governments clearly retained all the rights of sovereignty
which they had before the establishment of the constitution, unlets
they were exclusively delegated to the United States ; and this
could onlyexift, where the conditution, granted in express terms
an cxcluhve authority to the union, or where it granted in one in
ltance an authoiity to the union, and in another prohibited the
States from exercising the like authority, or where it granted an
authority to the union, to which a similar authorit) 111 the States
would be repugnant.
He applied these principles to the cafe in ques
tion ; andalked, whether the conltitution had,
in express terms, veiled the Congress with the
power of nianumillion ; or whether it retrained
the States from exerciling that power ; or whe
ther there was any authority given to the union,
with which the exercise of this right by any State
would beinconfirtent ? If these questions were
answered in the negative, it followed that Con
gress had not an exclulive right to the power of
manumission. Had it a concurrent right with
the States ? No gentleman would allert it, because
the absurdity was obvious ; for a State regulation
011 the fubjedt might differ from a federal regu
lation, in which cafe one or the other mult give
way : as the laws of the United States were pa
ramount to those of the individual States, the fe
deral regulations would abrogate that of the
States, consequently the States would thus be di
verted of a power which it was evident they now
had and might exercise whenever they thought
proper. But admitting that Congress had au
thority to manumit the slaves in America, and
were disposed to exercise it, would the Southern
States acquiesce in such a measure without a strug
gle > Would the citizens of that country tamely
iuffer their property to be torn from them ?
Would even the citizens of the other States,
which did not poflefs thisproperty, desire to have
all the slaves let loose upon them ? Would not
such a ftepbe injurious even to the slaves them
selves ? It was well known that they were an in
dolent people, improvident, averse to labor ;
when emancipated, they would either starve or
plunder. Nothing was a ltronger proof of the
absurdity of emancipation than the fanciful
schemes which the friends to the measure had
suggested : one was to ship them off the country,
and colonize them in some foreign region ; this
plan admitted that it would be dangerous to re
tain them within the United States after they
were manumitted ; butfurely it would be incon
sistent with humanity to banish these people to a
remote country, and to expel them from their
native foil, and from places to which they had a
local attachment ; it would be no less repugnant
to the principles of freedom, not to allow "hem
to remain here, if they desired it : how could
they be called freemen, if they were against their
consent to be expelled the country ? Thus did the
advocates for emancipation acknowledge that the
blacks when liberated, ought not to remain here
to stain the blood of the whites by a, mixture of
the races.

Tlut tlit SccrctÂ«y of Sui.e beautTiorif d to appoint an addit'n
Clerk, in bis olficc, atafalary of Bso dollars, wlncli was agreed t
Â»nd a committee appointed, to bring fin a bill purfuam thereto
I Several petitions were read,and laidcn the table. Adjjurned
MONDAY, APRIL y.
Sundry petitions were read, and referred to
the Heads of Departments.
In Committee of the whole. Mr. Liverniore
in the chair.
The bill for farther fufpendingcertaiu claÂ«ic*
in the Collection Law, was readâand taken into
confederationâSome amendments were proposed
but not adoptedâand the bill paiied to be en'
grofled.
The bill allowing coinpenfation to John Ely
for his services as a Surgeon to the late army *a s '
read the second time, and debated. '
Mr. Seney observed, that Col. Ely had made
application to the late Congress, and he umler
ftood a report was brought in. He wilhed that
the report might be read.
Mr. Wadfworth said, that it was true the report
of a committee of the late Congress was brought
in ; but not adted uponâthat report was miilaid
or loftâit never could be foundâand there not
being a fufficient number of the States to form a
Congress at the subsequent, orlalt meeting, noth
ing was ever done.
Col. Bland, rose for enquiry : He wiflied to
know if the state of Connecticut had not fettled
with Col. Ely, as Commander of a Regiment in
the pay of that state ? If it has, he conceived it
would be a dangerous precedent to pay the gen.
tleman in both capacitiesâit would be paying
surgeons at a very exorbitant rate indeed.
Mr. Matthews and Mr. Burke were in favor of
a generous coinpenfation. They gave an account
of the extra services of this gentleman. The
former observed, that the enquiry was, whether
the services were neceflary to be performedâand
whether they were performedâthat they were
neceflary is abundantly apparentâand such evi
denceexilts of their having been rendered, thatl
presume 110 gentleman has any doubt 011 his mind.
It therefore is of no consequence by whom they
are performedâtheir being performed, entitled
to cooipenfation.
A gentleman has enquired, Wlietherthere was
no other surgeon among the prisoners ? At the
time now referred to, there was 110 otherâandat
a moment when the officers were very generally
sick with a fever, which at that time prevailed,
and his credit was so low that he could not pro
care ahorse to vifittliem, lie has walked 25 miles
a day.
The United States must have supported a sur
geonâand in paying this gentleman there will
be a laving, as it is notpropofed to allow rations.
Mr. White moved that the fpecified sum ftiould
be Itruck out, and leave the l'um to be allowed,
blank. He afterwards moved to strike out the
whole clause.
Mr. Matthews was opposed to the motionâalso
Mr. Burke, Mr. Jackson, and Mr. Sherman, who
entered into a particular consideration of the cafe.
Mr. Hartley was opposed to the motion. The
merits and pretensions of the petitioner justly en
titled him to compensation.
Mr. Boudinot faidhe had 110 doubt of the ser
vices having been performed by Col. Ely ; but he
was oppoied to the billâhe did not think the
mode the propet one. If he has an account for
services for which he has received no compensa
tion, the regular way would be to apply to officers
already appointed to determine on luch accounts.
He was therefore for (h iking out the furn, and
filling up the blank with alefs sum than the full
pay of a surgeonâor else to refer his application
to the Auditor of the Treasury.
Mr. Wadfworth: The gentleman is for refer
ing to the Auditor, and yet has stated the reafoas
why he cannot get juitice from that quarter.
The Auditor can make no allowances on ac
counts but agreeable to existing laws oftlie United
States authorizing him. This was evidenced in
the cafe of Baron Glaubeck.
He then adverted to the particular services of
Col. Ely, andfaid,he hoped theclaufe wouldnot
be stricken out. If he is to be compensated, it
mult be in this way, by virtue of a special law for
the purpole.
Mr. Seneyfaidhe was opposed to any law wliich
was to suit the cafc of ail individual only. If a
general law, to reach the cafe of others, fimilar
-1 y circumstanced, fhouldbe brought forward, he
would not ebjecft to it.
Mr. Clymer was in favor of the motion for
striking out, and greatly doubted, he said, the
propriety of the bill altogether.
Mr. White said he doubted generally the au
thority ot the House to make provision for pay
ment of demands which existed during thfc late
C ongrefsâefpecially as there was fufficient time
for an application to them, and an application was
in fa (ft made in the present cafe.
i he motion tor striking out the clause was car
ried in rhe affirmative.
It was then voted that the blank be filled with
" 1 hirty Dollars pr. Month."
Mr. Stone proposed a clause entitling all other
officers, finiilarly circumstanced, to the like al
lowance. This was withdrawn, to admit a moreparticular amendment, which fliould secure tlio
lauie object, proposed by Mr. White.
Mr. Boudinot said he hoped the committee would
jiot fpendtime in debating the amendment, but
rife, for the purpose of rejecting the bill in the
Iloufe, that Col. Ely may apply with his account
to the proper officer, which is the Auditor of the
Treasury.
A conliderable debate on this last proposition
took place.
Mr. Matthews said no man can suppose that any
similar cafe can be cited, where 280 officers who
were prif'oners were without a Surgeonâwhere
a great proportion of them were sick, and had 110
humanity shewn them, by those who held them
prisoners.
Mr. Heiiler said, if there are not any cases of
a fiinilar nature existing, the clause can do no
harmâif there is, the door is opened to their ob
taining likejuftice.
This amendment wasreje&ed. The Commit
tee then rose, and reported the bill with amend
ments âwhich were agreed to by the House.
The queltion on the bill's passing tobe engrofs'd
was negativedâ 24 to 22 âand so the bill was loft.
A bill for granting relief to certain officers of
the late army therein described, was read.
A meflage from the Senate was received, in
forming the House, that they recede from their
amendment to the bill for promoting the progrefi
of ufeful arts, which had been disagreed to, by the
House.
A meflage from the President of the United
States, with exemplifications of three adts palled
by the State of New-York, was received, viz.â
An Act, providing for the fafe keeping of prifon
ersofthe United States. An adt for ceding light
houfesto the United Statesâand an adl ratifying
the amendments to the Conftituiion.
The bill, ceding the Light House of New-York
to the United States, was referred to a feletl com
mittee.
In committee of the whole on the bill to provide
for the punishment of certain crimes againlk the
United States.
The clause which provides for the difle&ion of
the bodies of malefa&ors, it was moved should be
struck out.
This, it wasfaid, was wounding the feelings of
the living, and could do no good.
It was said in answer, that it was only follow
ing a mode adopted by some of the wisest nations.
It was making those who had injured society,
contribute to its advantage by furnifhing fubjedts
of experimental surgery. It was attended with
salutary effeifts,as it certainly encreafed the dread
of punishment, when it is contemplated with this
atttendant circumstance.
Mr. Stone was opposed to the clause : He said
it was contrary, he believed, to the pracfiicc of
the several Statesâthat it was making punifh
jnent wear the appearance ofcruelty, which had
a tendency to harden the public mind.
Mr. Williamfon ltated a variety of arguments
in favor of the clauseâand she wed the very great
and important improvements which had been
made in Surgery from experiment.
Mr. Page spoke againlt the clause. And Mr.
Smith and Mr. Sedgwick in favor of it. The com
mittee rose without decidingâand the house ad
journed.
TUESDAY, APRIL 6
The engrofled bill, further to suspend part of
the collection law, was readâthe blank filled up,

ferred to a committee of the whole House.

A report from the Secretary of the Treasury,
on the memorial of the Baron de Steuben was read.

for the punishment of certain crimes against the
United States.âThe motion for striking out the
clause refpedling the bodies of murderers being
delivered to surgeons after execution, for diflec
tion, was further debatedâa number of gentle
men spake on each fide of the questionâthe af
firmative was supported by Mr- Page, Mr. Heif
ter, Mr. Jackson, Mr. Stone, Mr. Tucker, and
Mr. Clymerâthe negative by Mr. Huntington,
Mr. Madison, Mr. Smith (S. C.) Mr. Sedgwick,
Mr. Williamfon, and Mr. Ames ; and the motion

FOR the best: comparative experiments on the
culture of wheat, by sowing it in the common
broad-cad way ; by drilling it, and by fettingthe
grain, with a machine, equi-diftant ; the quanti

It is a generally received opinion, that horses
in a team travel much fafter than oxen ; yet some
European writers on husbandry mention nianyin
llances, in which it appeared, not only that oxen
would plough as much ground as an equal num
ber of horses, but also travel as f.ill with a loaded
carriage ; particularly when, instead of yokes and
bows, they were geared in horse harness, with
such variations as were neceflary to adapt it to
their different lhape. Toafcertain the powersof
oxen in these particulars, and the expence of
maintaining them, thefociety deem matters of ve
ry gieat moment; and are therefore induced to
offer a gold medal forthebeftfet of experiments,
undertaken with that view ; and for the next best
a silver medal. In relating.tliefe experiments, it
will be proper to describe the age and size of the
oxen, their plight,the kinds and quantities oftheir
food, the occasions, manner, and expence of /hoe
ing them ; in travelling, the kinds of carriages
used, and weight of their loads, and seasons of the
year, and the length and quality of the roads :
And, in ploughing, the size and fafhion of the
plough, the quality of the foil, the depth of the
furrows, and the quantities ploughed : And, in
every operation, the time expended, and num
ber and forts of hands employed in performing
it; with many other circumstances which may
more fully elucidate the subject. These experi
ments will enable the ellayitt to determine what
will be the bed form and conftruiftion of yokes
and bows, and what of ox-harness, to enable oxen
with the best carriage of their bodies and heads,
the most ease, and quickest step, to draw thehea
vieft loads, a description of cach ofwhi h fort of
fears, explained on mechanical principles, must
e subjoined to the account of experiments: To

for the belt method of improving them, by plant

founded on experiment, âa gold medal ; and for
the next best, âsilver medal. To be produced by

either in plate or medals, or the equivalent there
of in money.
The claim of every candidate for a premium is
to be accompanied with, and supported by, cer
tificates of refpeiftable persons, of competent
knowledge of the fubjed:. And it is required,
that the matters, for which premiums are offered,
be delivered in without their names, or any inti

ant thinks fit; fnch claimant fending with it a
paper sealed up, having on the oufide a corre
sponding mark, and on the inside the claimant's
name and address.

may be added, and will be acceptable.

Agriculture Society.
Minute of the Special Meeting of the Directors
of the Quebec Branch, 21ft December, 1789.
" Ordered, That the Process in preparing Seed
" Wheat, as communicated by Mr. Carrier, be pub
Â« HJhed in the Quebec Gazette, and in the Herald."
FFOM the experiments madebyMonf. J. Car
tier of the parilh of St. Antoine on Chamblee
River, laid before the Directors of this branch,
it appears, that SMUT in WHEAT, may be effec
tually prevented by using the following precau
tion.
Let the WHEAT intended for SEED be thrice
thoroughly walhed, and let the water drain from
it after the third washing; thenfteepit eighteen
hours in brine ltrong enough to float an egg, and
spread it on the floor to let the brine run off; but
whillt the WHEAT is yet nioilt, let quick lime
be equally lifted over it. ftirringic very well with
a Ihovel, and continue lifting on more lime until
the WHEAT is equally dusted with it, in the pro
portion of half a gallon for every bulhel of
WHEAT. By Itirring it well with a Ihovel, the
WHEAT will soon be dry and fit for sowing.
Some exceeding smutty IVheat, or what the in
habitants call bled charbonne, was prepared by Mr.
Cartier in the manner above direcfted and imme
diately sown ; the sample sent to the Directors of
this Branch, as the produce of that very smutty
Wheat was good, clean well-filled grain.

FROM FRANCE.
" Had we nothing to oppofebut the army, we
might soon bring these abje(ft mercenaries into
non-exiltence ; but the difdainful high clergy and
the enraged aristocracy are composed of so many
dangerous men, that by their duplicity and ma
chinations it is poflible they may turn the fcaleiu
favour of the former government : Beiides, we
are surrounded with powerful princes, who we
cannot expedt will long continue idle fpe&ators.
The French WASHINGTON, the young hero
who fought several battles in the course of your
glorious revolution has been chosen Generalillimo
of all the militia of the kingdom by the universal
voice of the militia at large. Each province
strove which fnould be foremoft in confiding its
liberties in the hands of the truly noble and illus
trious the Marquis de la FAYETTE. How fortu
nate were you to have the federal government ef
tabliihed without the loss of a single man ; this
Ihows the charafteriitick wisdom of those enlight
ened men who were the promoters of that happy
event. Since the English language and American
Liberty are come in falhion, the libraries of our
Literati are crouded with books on politicks, con
stitutions, &c. but I mult sincerely confefs that
one of your home productions seems to have the
preference from the perspicuity of the ideas and
the force of the style. Publius has gained a de
served applause, and is ranked among those
whose works will reach posterity. Many of the
belt families within my reach are preparing to
cross the Atlantick next spring, and should the
troubles continue much longer, the emigrations
mult become of consequence to your riling em-
THE ARTS,
Nothing gives us more fatisfadtion, than to note
the happy advancement of the Arts and Sciences
in our country. Atprefent we have the peculiar
pleasure of announcing to the citizens of Ameri
ca, the completion, by Mr. Gullager, of an e
legant bust of THE 1 RESIDENT of the United
States, in I'laifter of Paris, as lafge as the life
in which the beholder, at firft view, recognizes
the Great Deliverer of our Country. The Con
noifleurs who have visited Mr. Gull a ger's room,
to examine this beautiful piece of statuary, are
unanimous in pronouncing its merits, and the
merits of the ingenious artilt who has produced it.
So anxious are even the countrymen for the as
sumption of the State debts by Congress, that one
having read in the papers its being effected, cried
out in great extafy, " joy to thee my friendâl
wish you joy," "of what?" alked the other,
" Why thatCongrefs has confi/MerftheSrate debts."

American hemp.
The indefagi table exertions of John R et>( ] Â£<- d
and others, in promoting the growth of tine
valuable article of commerce, Hemp, merit much
from their country as from the spirit for cul
tivating this commodity which now reigns, there
is not a doubt, but in a few years, a favin'a M ;|j
be made of Â£.7o,oooayear to the commonwealth
in this single article. Tuesday fen'neight, a load'
raised by Mr. Read, was brought to town from
Roxbury, and pronounced by judges, to'be far
fuperiourto the bell RufliaHeinp. And on Satur
day last, a load, of equal quality, raise.l by Major
Rugglts of Roxbury, was brought to town ; and
it is with pleasure we can inform the public from
the bed authority, that Hemp raised in this State
is continually bringing to market. [A bounty ol*
12s. per cwt. is given by this Commonwealth for
all merchantable Hemp railed within the fame
as also a bounty on Duck, Sail Cloth and Twine
which is extended to January, 1792.]
AMERICAN CLASS.
It is with pleasure we learn that theglafs Ma.
nufadtory in Maryland, is thriving fait. The
glass lately man ufaftured there is equal in quality
to that imported from Europe : when we con.
fider the great expence and labour attending an
undertaking of this kind, the advantage and be.
nefits resulting from the eltablifhment of Manu
factories in America, we cannot but hope that the
encouragement of both public and individuals
will be equally great. âWe learn that Looking
GlafTes will be manufactured atthefe worksinthe
Spring.
