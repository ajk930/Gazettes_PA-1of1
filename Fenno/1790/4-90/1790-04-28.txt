THE TABLET.- No. CIX.
" When an eminent man dies, it is worth while to enquire into
the causes which conduftcd him to eminence."
THERE is ill the character of every diftin
guilhed perfou, fomethiug to admire, and
fomethiug to imitate. The incidents, that have
marked the life of a great man, always excite cu
riosity, and often afford improvemei . II there
are talents, wo can never hope to equal ; if there
is a leries of good fortune, we can never expecft
to enjoy, we itill need not lose the labor of our
biographical enquiries. We may probably be
come acquainted with habits, which it may be
prudent to adopt, aud discover virtues which we
cannot fail to applaud. It will be easy for the
reader to make a full application of these remarks
in his contemplations upon the late celebrated
Dr. Franklin. By his death one of the belt
lights of theworld may be said to be extinguilh
ed. I shall not attempt any historical details of
the life of this illuftriotis patriot and philosopher,
as 1 .have nothing further in view than to make
a few comments upon the raoft Itriking traits of
his character.
Original genius was peculiarly his attribute.
The native faculties of his mind qualified him to
â¢oenetrate into every science ; and his unremit
ted diligence left 110 field of knowledge unex
plored. There were 110 limits to his curiosity.
His enquiries were spread over the whole face of
nature. But the study of man seemed to be his
highest delight ; and if his genius had any fpe
cinl bias, it lay in discovering those things that
made ineu wiier and happier. As truth was the
sole objeift ofhis refearchss, he was of course 110
fetftary ; and as real on was his guide, he embra
ced 110 fvftein which that did not authorise. In
Ihort, he laid the whole vol#me of nature open
before him, and diligently and faithfully perused
Nor -were his political attainments lefs'confpi
cuous than his philofoplmat. The amicus trivi
ally ranked good fortune among those circum
stances of life which indicate merit. In this view
Dr. Franklin is almciil unrivalled, having seldom
undertaken more than he accompliflied. The
â world wÂ« too well acquainted with the events of
his political career to require, at this time, a par
ticular enumeration of them. It may be preln*
ined the historians of die American revolution will
cxhibit.them in proper colors.
If Dr. Fra::lilin did not af'pire after* the splen
dor of eloquence, it was only becaule the demon
strative plainness of his manner was superior to
it. Tho he neither loved political debate, ltor
exaelled in it, he itiil preserved much influence
in public atlemblies, and dil'covered an aptitude in
his remarks, on all occasions. He was not fond
of taking a leading part in such invettigations as
could never terminate iÂ»i any degree of certainty.
To come forward in quellions which in their na
ture are indefinite, and in their ifUie problemati
cal, does not comport with the caution of a man,
who has taught hifnfelf to look for demonftrntion.
He reserved hisabfervations for thole cases which
science could enlighten, nr.d com men i'enfe ap
prove. Thefiuipliciry of hisflile was well adapt
ed to tha ckamefs of h:s undcrUanding. His
conceptions were so bright and perfect, that he
did not choose to invol\e thein in a cloud of ex
prefiions. If he tiled metaphors it was to illustrate,
and not to embelliih the truth. A man, pofleffing
â such a lively imagery of ideas, flionld never affecft
the arts cfa vain rhetorician, vvivofe excellence
consists only in a beautiful arrangement of words.
But whatever claims to eminence Dr. Franklin
may have, as a politician,oi< a scholar, there is no
point of light in which his character fhir.es with
more lultre. than wheli we \iew him as a man or
a citizen. He wa3 emineiitly great in common
things. Peibaps r.o man ever exilted, whose life
can with mote juflire be denominated ufeful.â
Nothing ever palled through his hands without
receiving-improvement; and 110 per foil ever went
into his company without gaining wiidom. His
fagadkr nvesfo ikarpj and his science so various,
that whatever might be the profellion or occupa
tion of those with whom he conversed, he could
meet every one upon their own ground. He could
enliven every converfadon with an anccdotc, and
conclude ic wit ha moral.
The whole tcjior of his life was a perpetual lec
ture agaiirft (he idle, the exnavagauf, and the
' proctl. It wns his principal aim to inspire man

gality ; and to inculcate such duties as promote
the important interests of humanity. He never
wafted a mqment of time, 01" lavished a farthing
of money in folly and diHipation. Such expen-

a sensibility of heart by jjc'ts of.privatc
charity.
By a judicious division of time Dr. Franklin ac
quired theart of doing every thing to advantage;
and his amufenients were of such a nature as could
never militate with the main objeifts of his pur
suit. In whatever lituation he was placed by
ichance or design, he extracted lomething ufeful
lor himfelf or othei s. His lile was remarkably
full of incident. Every circuintlance of it turiied
to some valuable account, ihe maxims, which
his discerning mind has formed, apply to innu
imerab'le cases and characters. Thoj'e who move
in theloweft, equally wi'.hthofe who move in llie
most elevared rank in society, maybe guided by
his inftruftions. In the private deportment of
his lite, he, in many refpec'ls, has furnifhed a most
excellent model. His manners were easy and ac
commodating, and his address winning and rel
pecftftil. All who knew him, speak ofhiui as a
moll agreeable man ; and all who have heard of
him, applaud him as a very ufeful 011 c. A man

of long diflenfinns. the critical situation of the finances, and the
uncertainty of the public funds ; all thef: circumftanccs united,
keep upa general agitation and anxiety in the minds of even the
real friends to the prosperity of the kingdom.
" A great and glorious end it is, which you have in view ; but
it mud be attained without new copvulfions. It was, I must pro
fefs, in a manner more mild and tranquil that 1 had hoped to con

" TheCe labors I have hitherto guarded,VÂ»y a continual vigilance,
from thf unhappy influence of those d'flrclstul circumllances, in

which threatened us last year have been averted. The disorder
which the ftaUe of the finances, the discredit, the exceflive fcacce
nefc of (pecie, and the gradual decay of the revenue, ought natur
ally to produce ; this disorder, or least its excess, has hitherto
been avoided. I have, notwithflanding the feeblenefs of the means
of authority, maintained the kingdom, not indeed in that perte6t
calm 1 could have wiftied, but in a state of fiiificient tranquility to
receive the bit flings of a wife and well regulated liberty ; in fine*
notwithstanding our interior situation, so well known, nolwith

peace abroad, and have kept up with all the powers of Europe,
such terms of refpeft and si iendlhip, as ought to reader this peace
durable,
" After 'laving thus preserved you thofc- adveifc circum

for the advantage of Franco. 1 cann<st fcize a better occasion ot
doing so than that iu which you present for my acceptation the
decrees designed loeftablilh throughout the kingdom anew or
ganization which is to have so important an influence on the pros

I will second, I will aflift, by all the means in my power the
success of this vart organization, on which depends, in my opin
ion, the fa ft ty of Fiance ; and J thick it necessary to declarc to
vou, thaL I too clearly fee the dangers of all kinds that surround
u.s, not to feel, that in the present difpohtions of men's minds, and
in the present state of public aflairs, it is neceirary that the
new order of thing* should be established with calmness apd trail

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
TUESDAY, MARCH 50.
The proportion for ajfuming the Jldte debts under confid;ration.
MR. Stone said he bad mentioned on a former occafton that
New-York and Pennsylvania were become accountable a$
States for large funis, the former on account of confifcated cftates ;
the latter to the Penn family ; the gentleman from Phi
ladelphia had said that that State has no idea of burdening tbe
union with that debt. He did not suppose thÂ«t those States had it
in contemplation to transfer them to the United States ; but if Uie
creditors prefer the funds of the United States to those of the in
dividual governments, they can place their demands on a conti
nental eftablilhment, nor can the State prevent it. It had been said,
that debts of this description were notconGdered by the Secretary
in his cftimate of the amount of the State debts ; this affords ad
ditional (trengih to the argument again ft alTuming, which arises
from the utTcertainty of the amount which wc may have to provide
funds for ; it is evident in this way the State debts may be en
creafedtoan enormous amount.
Mr. Lawr ance observed that it was doubted whether the
accounts between the several States would ever be adjusted, and
this formed a principal obje&ion to the aflumption of the Suite
debts. He requeftcd gentlemen, who had tbefc doubts, to con
sider what had been done by the late and present government to
effe6t this business ; that a board of commiflionei s, Â«vith very cx
tenfive powers, had beenere&ed ; those comnaiflioners had been
recognised by the prefcht government; provision had been maAe
for their pay, and the pay of their clerks, and an addition to the
pay of the latter had been agreed on by the hottfe of feprefenta
tives. The amendment to the present proportions proposed by a
gentleman from Virginia, and adopted by the committee, premi
led that effe&ual provision (hould be made for liquidating and fet
tling these accounts : fothat if those already adopted, and which
were now in were not fufficienr, adequate and proper
mealures for the purpose -would, it was highly probable, be a
greed on. Really believing that these accounts would finally be
adjulted, he could not discern that any injufticc could be done
by theaffumption, because the sum a (Turned was to be charged to
the State, and would be set off agwnft claims of the State for the
expenditures during the war, eithet for general or particular de
fence.
He further observed, that he considered the evidences of claims
in poHellion of individuals were founded on fucb expenditures of
monies and supplies furrvfhed, as the States would eventually be
credited for ; and although there was an inequality in these debts
at present, yet a final liquidation would do justice to all. In the
intermediate time, he supposed it would be a measure founded in
justice and found policy to aftume these demands, which were li
quidated by the States, and which were polTefied by individuals,
because there was no solid diftinttion between them and those
wludh they possessed as claims against the union ; as the former
Â»â were for the fame fervlees, and ftipplifis, and were to have been
paid out of a common fund fuppiied by the refpe&ive States t in
certain proportions, but which has not been done ; and on ac
count of the deficiency and inability of this fund, were, at the re
commendations of the late Congress, assumed by the several States
to their refpeflive citizens.
By the change of government, the funds appropriated to dif
eharge the.e demands were now occupied or might be possessed
by Congress ; and it was proper, when the revenues were taken,
the debts (hould also be taken. Arr effe&ual proviAon could be
made for all the debt*-, with more ease and convenience, and with
3efs expence to the citizens of the union, by systems proceeding
from the general government, than if they were made by the for
mer for one class of creditors, and by the State government for
another. If the assumption {hould not be made, probably dif
ferent provisions would be made by the States for their debts,
"which would depend either on their abilities or policy, and a di
versity of interest be occasioned, which, in its operation, might
be prejudicial to the general happiness; and the only effe&ual and
proper mode of obviating this, was to assume the State debts,
"whereby the different creditors would have their demands pro
vided for and discharged by the fame body, and those contend
ing interests, which would otherwise take place, prevented.
He remarked that a question had been asked, whether it Was
caher to provide for a large debt than a small one ? The debt ol
the union was fufficiently large, and if we added the State debts
the difficulty would be increased.
Mr. Lawrance observed that these debts already existed, though
an different shapes, yet substantially the fame : transferring the
demand from the State to the anion did not change the entire sum
owed by the union and the States, and provision ought to be made
for the whole : that supposing it would be made, the union, hav
ing the revenues of the particular States unincumbered and unoc
cupied, could make provision moie conveniently and more fatis
iattorily than can be done if the assumption (hould not take place,
and part of these revenues, probably the mod produÂ£live part,
prc-occupied and retained by several of the important States ; the
mode of providing for the debrs would be more agreeable to mi*
3iy States in the union, as it could be done by imports and exci
lcs, and we should rid many of the States from the oppreflive
Â®f. taxes ; the former would do general justice, as
each individual in the union would pay according to his confump-
Particular instances have been mentioned to (hew that injuf
be done to some States, if thfe proportion was adopt
ed ; but these contemplated that no fettlemcnt would take place.
\ " r ovuion could be made to obviate difficulties in these cases ; ami,
m determining on a general proposition, it was lufficient thrat the
principle of it was ju(t, because when it was assented to, and to
be carried into effeft,the details and provisions could be suggested,
considered and made as fliould appear proper.
Mr. Lawrance concluded that the proposition was just and pro
per, and would be productive of national advantage; and as it
had, so it again should receive his afleot.
The following objervations were made by Mr. Sherman, the 12 th injl.
' A CC ou^c f( l divided on so important a fub
jeft, It gives mc great concern on account of the threatning as.
pert it has on the peace and welfare of the government.
The support of public credit by a provision for doing justice to
*k " '. ors t ' le United States, was one great objefl that led to
the eftabliffiment ot the prefenl government, and ffiould it fail of
doing justice to so great a proportionof them as are involved in this
provision. it would lose the confidence of many of its bell friends,
and disappoint the expe&ations of the people in geneeal.
I consider the debts incurred by the several states in support of
the war, and for the common defence and general welfare, as the
oebts of the United States, and that those creditors have as just
and meritorious a claim on theunion for payment as any creditors
whatever. A great part of them were aflTumed by the states in be
half of the United States, in consequence of reqnifitions of Con
gref-. ,
I (hall not now go into a particular discussion of the proposition
before the committee, (every thing having been already said that
may relief! light on the fubjefl) but (hall only Hate the reasons on
"which I (hall give my vote in the affirmative.
The measure appears to me both just and politick. Just, with
refpeft to the creditors, whose debts are due for services and sup.
plies rendered in support of the common caufeofthe union, which
therefore ought to be paid out of the fame common funds, as the
"ther creditors of the United States, and although some of the
"ates would be able to provide for their creditors as well as the
United States, yet that is not the cafe as to those whose exertions,
luffentigs and burthens have been much greater, than the others,
and it would not give fatisfaftion to aTTume the debts of some
states, and not of others.
The measure will be jujl with refpeft to the several States, be
caufeeach will bear only its just proportion of the present bin.
then, and their past exertions and expenditures, will be equitably
adjusted in the final settlement of their accounts, for which effec
tual provision is to be made by the fame aÂ£l that provides for the
assumption of the debts. '
The policy of the measure confills in its tendency to promote
iuftice and harmony, and confidence in the government, in al
leviating the burthens of a number of the States, who from
their situation and circumstances during the war, were necefiitated
to make grcaten exertions, and were fubjefted to greater fuf
ferings ana expenditures than the other States, and by put
ting all the funds neccflary for paying the debts under one dj
rtition, to facilitate the collc&ion and render thein more produc
tive and less embarrafling to commerce. The principal resource
for pay (the impost) is in pofTellion of the general government.
But if the date debts are jiot assumed, the states which have
heretofore borne the greatest burthens,-will be left still to fuflain
ihofe unequal and grievous burthent, or their creditors will be
left without any provision for fatisfying their claims either of
which would be unreasonable, and occasion great uneasiness
-which will tend to embarrass and obfti uÂ£ithe measures of govern
ment.
It has been (aid, let those States wait until their accounts with
the United States (hall be fettled, and then receive feenritv for the
balances that mav be due to them ; But why Ibould those States
Vie fubjefted to greater burthens at prefenl, than the other States ?
As it is not known which are Debtor or Creditor States, why not
bear the burthen equally until that can be afcertamed ? If there
is to be no settlement, I think it is a conclusive argument that the
-whole public debt Ihould be alTiimed bv the United States. It
ougfit to be presumed that the States have made exertions accord,
ing to their abilities, and in due proportion until the contrary ap
pears, and that can no otherwise appear, but by a settlement of the
accounts ; and until that is done I can fee no good reason why any
State (hould bear more than its ju(t proportion of the exiftingdebts
whether contracted by the United Slates, or by the individual States'
it incurred for the common defence, or general welfare of the
Union. It is said there is no rule established toafcertain tjie quo
tas of the several States ; but I think the rule is fixed by the refo-
Jutions of the late Congrcfs,of the 22d of November 1777, and the
third of June 1784, and the provision in the new Conllitution for
apportioning direÂ£t taxes.

" A nation, after having groaned un
der the chains of for many centuries,
whenever it is bold enough to attempt to break
them, not withstanding all the absurd institutions
that (lill inuft surround it, resembles a sick man,
whole strength is extreamly weakened by long
fufFerings, and whose vital spirits have been con
sumed by inceflant fevers ; if he makes use of too
violent or too many remedies at once, or def
pelately takes it into his head to force nature,
he dies the victim of his imprudence."

From Madrid we learn, that a Mr. Fitzgerald
a member of the Parliament of Paris, being at
dinner at the Duke de Crillon's house there, the

fuffered some words to escape him, reflecting on
the condud: of Count d'Artois.
The Duke de Crillon could not permit fnch re
flections to pass unnoticed, accordingly desired
Mr. Fitzgerald to withdraw. Fearing that this
mifimderftanding might create much noise with
out doors, the Duke went immediately to the
Prime- Minister's house, where he obtained an or
der for the apprehension of Mr. Fitzgerald, who
was fliortly after seized at chehouleof the Count
Cabarras, and conduced to prison. It is intend
ed that he fliall be escorted out of the kingdom
immediately.

Fcciix qu'em faciunt aliens pericu'.a cauturr.
TUT. French nation, known in antiquity under the appcilMio
of the Franks, were originally from the heart of Germany
In the declension of the Roman hmpire, they inhabited a countr
in the North, along the river Rhine, lituated between Bavari
and' Saxony, which still prcferves the name of Franconin. Havin;
cxceffivelv multiplied, as it happens in cold climates, their coun
try was tonnd, n it fulnc iently - xtenfive to contain them, nor ler
tile enough to nourish them. Excited hy the example of thci
neighbours, they resolved by a common voice, to divide them
Jelves into two nations ; one of which thould continue to inbabi
their ancient country; and the other endeivor to procure clfe
"where by the force ot arms, an establishment more vad, mor<
commodious and more fertile. 1 his enterprise was resolved, am
this division made by unanimous content. Such as were deftinet
hy lot, to essay their fortune, although trained to war, and inca
pable of teiror at the appreheÃfion of the danger# of such an en
terpnf^; thought however, that thev ought not to abandon :t t.
anarchy or hazard, but to conduct it with prudence and order
To concert the measures necelfary for the execution of their pro
jest, they atTcmbled in the plains, in the neighbourhood ot th.
river Sala. Accufionned for many ages, to live in the obedienc.
of a prince ; and thinking the monarchical (late the most convc
nierit to a people who afpirc to augment their power, and extent
their conqueds, they relolved to .hoofra king, who lhould uniti
in his single pcrfon, all the authority ij the nation. Here perhap
Davila is incautious and inaccurate; lor the Fianks, as well a.
Saxons and other German nations, though their government
were monarchical, had then Grandees and people, who met anc
deliberated in National Aflemblies, whose results were often t<
fay the lead, confidercd as laws. Their great misfortune was
that, while it never was fufliciently afccrtained, whether the so
vereignly refidcd in the kine or in the national ajjembly, it wa
equally uncertain, whether the king had a hegwive on the adem
bly; whether the Grandees had a negative on the king or thi
people; and whether tl)r people had a negative on both, oreither
This uncertainty will appear hereafter in Davila Inmfelf, to marl
itscourfe in bloody chai afters; and the whole hidory ofFtance wil
shew, that from the fird migiation of the Franks trom German)
to this hour, it has never brrii fufficientlv explained and decided
To this supreme degree of power in the king aÂ» Djvila pto
ccedsUhey added, that the crown should be hereditary in the la
mily 'clefted ; forcfeeing, that if tt were eU3tve, it would be
fourceof civil wars, which would prove dettruftive to all thci
enterprifa. Mankind, in new eftablifhmems generally ast witl
iiiicerity. and with a tingle view to the public good. They litter
neither to the ambition nor the intcrctt of private persons; An.
Pharamond was eleftcd king, by unanimous content. He was ;
son of Marcomir, ilTue of the blood which ha 1 governed the na
lion for many ages : And, to an experienced valor, united a pio
found wiMom, in the art of government; it was agreed that th.
fame title and equal power, lhould descend to his legitimate pof
tcriiy of the male line, in default of which the nation should re
turn to their right of elrfting a new fovcreign. But as unlimitec
authority may easily degenerate into tyranny, the Franks, ai th,
time of the elcftion of their king, demanded the eftabbdimc.it o

Sundry other Societiesâtogether with a numer
ous and refpecftable body of Citizens.
The concourse of fpetlators was greater than
ever was known on a like occasion. It is confu
ted that not less than 20,000 persons attended and
wirnefled the funeral. The order and silence
which prevailed, daring the Proceflion, deeply
evinced the heartfelt J'enf'e, entertained by all
clafles of citizens, of the unparralleled virtues,
I talents, and services of the deceased.
This day the Supreme Executive Council of
Fennfylvania, agreed to wear mourning for one
month, in memory of their great and good fellow

Madame Mafl'on, the celebrated Tennis-player,
lately arrived from Paris, has had audience of
his royal highness the Duke of York.âThisGal
.lunt heroine of the Raquet, it seems, challenges to
plav with any person in Europe for one thousand
guineas.âThe royal Duke is to have the honor of
firft entering the lilts with her, flie plays in her fe
male attire a la Crecque, with a short petticoat and
drawers.
So warm a party spirit is excited at Manchester,
by the application of the diflenters for a repeal of
the tdt aÂ»ft, that upwards of three-hnndred gen
tlemen have formed theijifelves into a club for the
f'lpport of the church : they wear an uniform of
lilac,'with fear let collars ; the collegiate clmrcli
on tile button,with the motto, " Pro Arts et Focis."
The French afletnbly have fettled pensions up

The English government not in the least con
cerning itlelf with the education of youth, seems
to be a capital defeiTt. Any perfou, however,
meanly qualified, is at liberty to open a school, a
liberty which does often a great deal of milchief.
The lower clafles of people are much negledicdin
their education,and much more foin England than
in Scotland. In the latter, literature is encourag
ed almost to a fault, there scarce being a cow
keeper or falinon-catcher, in that country, who
does not understand Latin, a little Greek, elo
cution, ancient my-thology, &c. were government
to lay heavy fines upon all unqualified teachers,
both learning and its profeH'ors would foonbere
fpetftable. Our national superiority with refpedt
to sciences was much more conspicuous in the be
ginning of the present century than at this pe
riod.
