" Tl,erc arc cerUln '"uations where foppefcd evils are productive
of mach good."
A National debt attaches many citizens to the
government, who, by their numbers,wealth
and influence, contribute more perhaps to its
prefei vation than a body of soldiers. This ob
servation has been made by every one. A nati
onal debt not only prolongs the existence of the
form of government ; but it has a direift ten
dency to produce a wife and just administration
â¢ This efFeÂ»ft is not equally obvious. Every
measure tending to public good adds something
to the security of the debt. It is for the advanT
tage of the creditors to have that public, which is
their debtor, become rich. The fame reason ap
plies to the revenue laws. The creditors will
wish to bring into the treasury the moil money
with the least possible burden, or even difgult
to the people. This is equally true of the public
expences. This body of men will fee the public
money squandered with pain and apprehension.
Their influence will be exerted in fupportofa
system of frugality. It seems to be inanifeft that
the creditors will defxre to fee the public good
promoted, and of courfewill dread an opprefllve
and prodigal administration. It only remains to
calculate the influence that this body of men will
have, firft, upon the public opinion, and next up
on the government itfelf. In this country, they
are powerful by their numbers ; by their pro
perty ; by their patriotifin j for it was that which
made great numbers of thein public creditors.
They arejuftly denominated by the Secretary
" enlightened men." Their dispersed situation en
ables them to give a strong impulse to the public
mind in different parts of the country at thÂ«
fame instant. Interest will wake when patrio
tifin flceps. As thefc persons have a common in
terest, and that corresponds with the general
interest of the society, felf love is combined
with the love of our country. They become
watchmen, and continue such, when other citi
zens, left interested, relax their attention to pub
lic affairs for the fake of their private concerns.
Much has been said in favour of republican jea
lousy. The creditors can never have ail interest
against libertyâfor tyranny and public credit
cannot exilt together. Heaven grant that the
union and the public liberty may last forever. If
any expedient within the reach of human wisdom
can preserve those blessings, it is the unchanging
interest, which a powerful body of the belt and
wisest citizens will have in their fafe keepingâ
who cannot neglect, and who will not betray the
trustâwhom government cannot do without, and
who cannnot do without government.
Rome fell, an almost unresisting pray to a des
potâwhy ? Roman liberty, as it was misnamed,
was 3 burden to every body, except to a few who
called their right to npprefe all others, libertyâ
being made alternately the instrument and viÂ«fiim
ot tyranny, the weary world found even despo
tism, a pillow of repose. But if the best citizens
in Rome and in the provinces had really enjoyed
freedom, and their property had depended on the
security of the government, they would have ab
horred any change, and most of all a change
from liberty to tyranny. Caesar would have been
watched and obliged to seek fame in th# Senate,
or in the field, under their orders.

res ult ofluch plans as he thought were conceived
in wifdoni and executed with prudence, prove
the reverie of all he had proposed to himfelf.
1 was led to these reflections by a view of the
pi efent ltate of public ass airs in this country, which
appear so eflentiallv to contradict the pleaiing
reveries of the Philosopher, and the sanguine
hopes of the well-meaning politician. I will not
attempt to delineate the durk pkfture which we
a fliort time since prefeiHerl to the view of the
worldâthe painful traces ij: :hat Ctuation are not
yet effaced from the reflerting mindâl will only
revert to the dawn of that day America ap
peared ushering with majeltic splendor thro the
dark clouds which had so long enveloped her po-
Imcal hemifphercâ I will just re cal to memory
that terafo honorable in the annals of mankind
which gave to her a form of government, not the
offspring of violence, but the result of calm and
mature deliberation, directed by a view to the ge
neral goodâand to thatflill more glorious epoch
when the hand which had so ably guided us thro
a long and perilous war, was called forth to dis
tribute the blessings of Peace, Liberty, and Inde
pendenceâ Knchanting Profpe<ft ! The irradiat
ing beams of pleasure broke on us with a lultre
aim oft too dazzlingâthe Wertern wilds of Ame
rica resounded in echoing her future glory and
the peaceful waters of the lakes arose into bil
lows fwelledby the general joy.
1 he happy unanimity and liberal policy which
marked the proceedingsofthe firflfelfion of Con
gress were calculated to confirm the most flattering
anticipation. Thefecond was opened by a speech
11 om the head of the nation, pure as the fountain
from which it ifiued, and urging in the most ex
prelnve language an early and eariieft attention
to such meafuresas would tend toeftablilh public
credit on an immovable basis, and restore to this
country that relpe<ftabijityfhe had lod in her'for
mer weak and confufed councils- To this end and
in conformity to a prior vote of government, the
Secretary of the Treasury reported a funding
fyifcejn, itamped the capacity of it 3 author,
and constructed on those Apsm national princi
ples which will alone lead us to national honor
âbutalgs, every feature of this fair portrait, has
been wantonly distorted, or lays in broken pieces
at the several shrines of ambition, avarice, and
vanityâand the pride ofgaininga party athome,
or of leading one here, is found paramount to a
generous paifion for advancing the public good,
which is only seen to arise in the finoke of the
incense, burnt at the altars of State policies
Sad defalcations indeed in the aspiring hopes en
tei-tained from the late political revolution in this
country ! The failure of public measures is not
only to be attributed to the incapacity of rulers,
but to the palfions of ambition and resentment,
which are feldoin under control in men velted
with power, and where the degree of responsi
bility cannot by any human contrivance be made
adequate to the confidence reposed.
It is from the misapplication and perversion of
great talents we have every thing to searâthose
splendid abilities which are founded and intend
ed by providence to exalt national fame and pro
mote public happiness, operate in a contrary di
rection when abused ; and instead of procuring
honor, wealth and security to society, they in
volve in disgrace and entail inifery and disorder
on future generations.
It is to be hoped that the great neck ar, of Ame
rica, with all that superiority which belongs to a
cool and determined mind, will be found proof
againit the barbed fhafts of envy and interefled
ambition, and eventually triumph over both, in
his noble pursuit of the public welfare.
The free use of the press is the birth-right of
an American, which he will not consent to dilpofe
of for a mess of pottage ; it is the fan which kin
died that spark of liberty in this country, which
is fact spreading overall Europe, and bids fair to
illuminate the whole world.

The proportion for ajjuming the Jlatc debts under conjideration.
MR. William son observed that on a fubjeft which had
been handled by gentlemen of great information and abili
ties, he could not expect to offer new arguments, but as he had not
heard the arguments hitherto advanced, and as he differed very
much from the opinion of the late committee, it was a duty he
owed to himfelf, to the State he had the honor to represent, and
to the nation at large, to give fomc reasons why he conceived that
the debts of the several States ought not to be afTumed âHe ob
served that the national debt had been ftatrd at 54millions ofdol-

art, the lntereftot thu sum is 3,240,000 dollars. The debts of
the individual States had been Hated at 115 millions, he helieved a
tew millions might be added to that amourit, for he knew that
many citizens of North-Carolina had good claims agaiftft the State
or the union not hitherto fettled, aud the State had inftrufted in
delegates to obtain a longer time for exhibiting claims again!) the
United States. He believed thecitirensofVirginiahad alfc many
cLiimj to exhibit, and when he tonfiderrd the present claims of
North-Carolina, were 6 or 7 millions of dollats ; he thought it
not improbable that the amount of the debts might be near p
millionsâHe would call it for the present 25; The inteieft of that
turn is one million and a balf. He thought that an annual tax of

a great burthen is more ea&lv carried by making it greater â¢ he
heartily wilhed a fafe voyage to the political veflel, but he 'had
tome apprchenfions chat with the propoled cargo (he may fink at
her anchorsâHe knew that the proposed ta* is small when we
conlider the number of our fellow-citijens, and compare it with
the numbers in fevera| kingdoms and the taxes paid bv them ; but
the facility ofraifiijg taxes by iinpoAs and excises, is according to
the number of inhabitants in any given (pace,
In the aity of Pans, where a vail body of people are collected
within a small space, the inhabitants are supposed by one species
ol tax and another to pay 64 livres per head : in other Darts of that
Kingdom it has been found difficult to colled tg livres per head
from the fubjefls, though France is well peopled and contains
many contidcrable cities.
Ii three times as much could be coHcHed in the city of Paris by
imposts duties andcxcifes as in the other parts of France, he con.
ceived that very small sums might be expected to arise in Ameru
ca from excises, and our impost mult decrease in proportion as

lmpofed by the national government.
They (re dangerous because they have been the means of cruel
Oppreliion ; the Romans had never been completely miserable till
one of their emperors had the addrelj to introduce a capitation tax ;
he observed that his fellow-citizens in North-Carolina were not
in general rich, few of them were ioprovident as to lay up money ;
for this reason while he was entrusted with their concerns he
(houldoppofeeverymeafurethat looked towardsdireft taxation,
he withed never to fee the day, when tofatisfy a land tax, or a ca
pitation tax, a poor man's cow or horse might be takenfrom him
on which he depended for the support of helpless children. Let
the State debts be once assumed and you mull proceed; ifyutir
calculations are bad, and they are nothing more than pure con
jecture, if they are bad, and the impost and excise does not come
up to your expectations, the national honor tnuft be preserved
the debt is yours and must be paid, let the means be ever so hard!
It will doubtless be observed that the interest of the State debtjj
must be paid either by the several State? or by the union, and it is
indifferent to the people under what name they make the pay
mcnti. til is argument lie.alledgid Was extremely fallacious, for
alter the national legislature has imposed such taxes as might be
come general, the State legislatures may with great ease, and in
lomecafcs with great advantage to the citizens, impose other tax
es The produce of the flute, is different; the inhabitants hav.-
different modes of living, and there is a difference even in their
vices ; wherefore different taxesmight.be proper i such taxes mi fi ht
be ufeful to corrcft vices or restrain habits that ftiould not be in
dulged ; it will certainly be granted that the legislature ofthe ftatr.
in many cases can best accommodate the burthen to the strength
and feelings of the citizens. It had hitherto been confidercd that
the Kates owed certain duties, and that they had a certain quofi
oi services to perform, from the particular pohcy of fomc ofthe
Kates, their debts had depreciated greatly, certificates had been
Jd at Bs - 6d. in the pound, pqoplc would not readily be recon
ciled to the new creed, "that all the debts lately paid, arc state
debts, but all the debts not paid, arc national debts," especially at
this discovery is made after most of the certificates have changed
their original holders, and have passed for a trifle into the hands of
moneyed men. C liar's wife fhouldnotonly be chaste.but with
out suspicionâHe conceived that a national legislature should be
extremely cautious how they adopted new measures, efpeciallv if
there was a fmgle hook to which the suspicion of personal mteretl
might be attached
The situation of North-Carolina he alledged was somewhat dif
ferent frotn that of her After states; commiflioners had ort fundrv
occafioni ilTued continental securities to the citizens of the several
states, independent of thearmy certificatesjtothe'imountof 4, Rgii.ooo
dollars; of this sum about f),ooo dollars had been ilTued to the
citizens of North-Carolinaâthe citizens of that state have hardly
any continental securities, because the state by one accident or ano
ther has been obliged to a flume the payment of the continental dehis
ce has alTumed debts to the amount of 6 or 7 000,000 dol
lars. In what manner arejhe citizens to be rewarded for allthur
labors and supplies. He prayed the committee would attend to
the operation of this new fyflem; other states since the peice have
laid taxes to raise money for paying interest, and that interest hss
been returned into the hands of their own citizens. North-Caroli
na has imposed heavy taxes for finking certificates, being part of
the principal of the public debt; the citizen has drawn no relief
fiom those taxes, and to crown his misfortunes he is not to get a
credit for the certificates funk. The state has also iflued paper
money to the amount of 200,0001. that is to fay, half a million of
dollars; some of this money has been applied towards paying the
late continental line of the army* and some of it has been employ
ed in buying up public securities ; the fccurities are in the treasury,
but the paper money is in circulation ; our citizens are to he taxed
for finking this money, and we are not allowed a diitount for the
certificates which are purchased by the money : will not this be a
double tax ? we are required to pay our proportion towards the
interest of other people's certificatesâwe must at the fame time
pay taxes towards finking our paper money, which is another fpr
cies of certificates ; but we are not to be relieved in the mean time
by discounting the interest cf the certificates we have taken up.
Patience itfell would complain of such injustice. perhaps we lhall
be told that the double tax may be inconvenient but we shall be
repaid oti some future occasion ; we shall get a credit when the
accounts of all the states are fettled and the quotas of the several
states are fixed ; in other words ue may expctl jujlice at the day of
judgment. He prayed it might be observed that the accounts were
not in a train to be fettled ; that they could not poffiibly be fettled
under any existing law, and Congress had not >aken a single step
from which he could believe that they intended to make any set
tlement ; the original rule for fixing the quotas of the several states,
" according to the value of lands and their improvements," had
long since been given up as impraÂ£licablc ; Congress had substitut
ed no other rule in its place, if they.were seriously disposed to fet
tle the accounts of the several ftaterj and to render some measure of
justice to the most deserving, the neceflary steps were obvious. Jnforming a rule for fettling the accounts, he was persuaded that
North-Carolina would not appear to be illiberal, he presumed also
that (he would be dilpofed to make a generous allowance to the
several states for all services that had usually been called military ;
but he could not reconcile himielf to this system of assuming the
debt fir ft, and talking afterwards conceining its origin* It has
been oblerved that the state debts are not to be funded immediate
ly ; how (hall we account for this extraordinary zeal in declaring
absolutely that thev fliall be aflumed ? Are we afraid that the next
Congress will refute to do justice ? Are we desirous to cut off the
â poUibility of returning if we (hould change our minds on better
information ? One obvious benefit will arise from this sudden
adoption, a few meh who chanced to be near the feat of govern
ment, and were firft. possessed ot the fchemc, who flew to Caroli
na, and there bought up securities at 3s. in the pouud ; those men
-will be liberally rewarded, while his unfortunate fellow citizens
are left to pay a second tax for the fame object, and to complain
of the injustice of government. ,
On this occasion he said ho was not left to conjeflure what
â¢would be the sense of his constituents ; the late convention had
cxpreffed it fully in one of the amendments they had forwarded
to Congress, in the following words : u Congress shall not dtreftly
or indire&ly, either by themselves or through the judiciary in
terfere with any one of the States in the redemption of paper mo
ney, already emitted and now in circulation', or in liquidating
an<i discharging the public securities of any one of the States, but
<ach and every State (hall have the exclusive right of making such
laws and regulations for the above purpofei as they (hall think
proper."
In this amendment the convention had besi unanimous. On
thij occafiorx he was not only purfumg a measure that accorded
â¢with the sense of his constituents, but it was a meafurfc that' had
perfect justice for its object. North-Carolina asked for no favors,
Ihe fought for no advantages under cover of general resolves, (he
â was ready to account according to the spirit of the original con
tratt, a contrast that had not been altered by the new torm
of government, for justice was immutable. The new govern
ment could not be strengthened by hasty measures, much less by
any departure from justice.
Mr. Sedgwick said it had been reported abroad, and declared
in the house that those gentlemen who were in favor of the assump
tion, meant to prevent a settlement of the accounts of the indivi
dual dates, with the United States: To remove every obje&ion
arising from that source, he would take the libeity of declaring
once for all, and that in the most .unequivocal and pofitivelanguage,
that he did not now, nor ever had entertained such an intention,
and that he had the fulleft confidence that the fame declaration
-might be applied to every gentleman in favor of the measure.
Mr. Sedgwick said that the house after having exhausted the
fubjett in a most deliberate difcuflion, had again resolved them
selves into a committee, in consequence of the gentleman from
N. C. (Mr. W.) having pledged himfelf, in five minutes to demon
strate that by the afTumptionj the state he represented would be
defrauded of half a million of dollars. That he had attended very
carefully to the process of this demonstration, and perhaps it
might not be altogether time mifpent in communicating to the
committee the observations which had occurred to him upon it.
That he understood the gentleman to have declared that N. C.
had rendered fejvices beyond her proportion, that her debt cre
ated for national purposes, and part of which had been a&ually
assumed, was also beyond her proportion, that the accounts of
the individual states with the United States, would never be adjust
ed, and more, that there was an intention with the majority of
Congrtfs to prevent it; what conclusion was to be drawn from
this ? North Carolina would sustain an injury from the circum
stances dated, if the debt (hall not be aflumed ; common sense
would then di&ate that justice to N. C. required that the debts
ihanld be aflumed. This consequence however, was not deducea
from the premises; the gentleman had agreed that as N.C. inde
pendent of the alTumption would sustain an injury against which
she could by no other means be relieved, therefore he had tvijely
concluded that by the alTumption (he would be defrauded.
Mr. Sedgwick said the gentleman had further dated that N. C.
had been so unfortunate, that fomeof her confidential officers had
iiTued fraudulently 300,000 dollars in certificates; which certifi
cates, if the debt of that state should be aflumed, must be paid by
this government. If so, there could be no doubt but this govern
ment would indeed be defrauded, and N. C. would of course be
fubje&ed *o her proportion of the burden refu] ting from it: But
he wilhed the gentleman to consider whether the national councils
might not, aided by his wisdom and experience, be supposed to
possess neatly - as much fa gÂ« city in detecting frauds and guarding
against their effe&s, as the government of N. C.
The naxt argument of the gentleman, Mr. S. observed was
flill more extraordinary, and indeed greatly beyond his compre
hension. That he'had stated to the committee that N. C. had is
sued paper money to a certain amount, with this money they had
purchafrd certificates ; here then he concludes the state had made
one purchase for which it (hould have a credit; flill, however,
this money i*to be reduced, which will be an additional burden
on the people. Here thtn it is supposed to have been proved a
double payment has been made, and yet it is justly concluded
that only a (ingle credit rs proposed ,to be given for this wonder
fiA operation. Mr. Sedgwick said he would llluftrate the ingenr
oui argurtient of the gentleman by an example exactly similar, " I
borrov" Â«Â« said he" of my friend an hundred pounds for which* I
pay him ny bond, the man at the time agreed upon for the
jpaynwnt of the money, applies for it, whereupon I with a fobcr
iace tell him, that when I received his money he was paid for it
hy mv bond, nd should he he so unconscionable ai to insist on
his monfcy, h#- would receive double payment. Surely any reafona
i>icm*n would be convinced by the argument. fÂ° N- C.
.â¢pureh fed certificates with her valuable paper profiles, thi&isone
payment, fhc performs her promise are now double pay-
ments
Mr. Sedgwick observed that the gentleman had said, thatwhile
fomr- dates had made provision for the payment of the interest ot
the debt,' N. C. had not done so, Hie had redeemed the principal.
He said if indeed N. C. had neglected to make any provision for
the payment of the interest, and had caused the immAfe depre
ciation which would unavoidably arise from that iource, and had
then laid a fpecific tax payable in the principal, it was an argu
inrnt infinitely stronger than any he had fieard in favor of difcrf
mination ; but how it could operate againfl the proposed aflump
tion was beyond the powers of his mind to discover.
He further observed that the gentleman had produced the N. C.
amendment, as a reason agatnft. the assumption, that it had also
been declared to be a substantial argument against the meafurethat
the idea had never been contemplated by any bodkin the South
ern States until since the report of the Secretary. He said he
could not very well understand how the convention of N. C.
could propose an amendment with an intention to prevent a mea
furc they had never thought of.
The gentleman from North-Carolina had said he was sen
sible some of the states were unduly and unequally burdened, and
that he was willing to afford them relief when the accounts (hould
be fettled. At the fame time he was so candid as to declare that
he did not believe those accounts ever would be fettled. He said
that if the gentleman had pofTefTed less confidence in his own
powers of persuasion, he would perhaps have permitted at lead
one day to intervene between the one of those declarations and the
other.
" Thefc" said Mr, Sedgwick " are the arguments, the weigh
ty arguments, which the gentleman pledged himfelf fliould have
all the force of demonstration, nd in expv&ation of hearing
-which the majority qonfidered themselves authorised to suspend a
determination on a question the inoft important that ever came
- before this houfc ; a determination on which, the public mind has
long expfftcd with 3n anxiety proportioned to its magnitude."
Mr. Sedgwick concluded by observing that if the majority ofÂ»
the committee was influenced in their determination on this im
portant question by an enlarged, li beral and extended national po
licy, there could be no doubt of the result, but on the contrary,
if local and narrow ideas should prevail, he should despair of
fuccefs,and with it of those benefits which he had fondly hoped
would attend the administration of this government.
Mi. Williamfon, in reply to Mr. Sedgwick said that he had not
a fie r ted that North-Carolina had paid more ihan her proportion;
the gentleman does not hear well;he had said (he observed) that
North-Carolina had afTumÂ«d-to herfelf, more than her proportion
of the continental debt. He repeated his lemark that there was
a design to prevent afettlement. Let the settlement firft be made;
and North-Carolina will cheartully concur in alfuming the balan
ces which may appear to be due from the United Statesâ\but the
present plan is to get the whole funded, and let the settlement
come on as it will.
Mr. Page in opposition to afTumption said, it was a mcauire
which did not meet the approbation of the creditors themielvcs.
Some of the debts were contra&ed for purposes in which the left
were no more intended than a foreign nation. He then repeated
the observations refpe&ing consolidation ; the meafurc would tend
to that, and from that to monarchy. He enlarged on the idea of
a spirit of rivalfhip's giving rife to the debts of the fcparate States ;
they were free, sovereign and independentâwere at liberty to con
trast what debts they plcafed and the United States were not bound
to pay debts contrfftcd from such motives ; he hoped the com
mittee would abandon the proportion and go on to consider the
reft, which are totally independent of it.
Mr. Goodhue, after obfervmg that,the comparative view of
the merits and ferviccs of the (pveral States has nothing to do with
the prelent question, said, the war commenced when there was
no legiflatiye body to represent the Union ; it was carried on by
paper money ; when that ceased, and the credit of the l-nited
â¢States was goneâthey applied td the individual States ; Congreis
depended on the credit of the States, separately ; hence arofethe
debts of the Statesâand thus it appears demonstratively, that those
debts aie the debts of the United States ; contra&cd on their ac
count and which they are bound by every principle of justice and
policy to provide for. This obligation it appears is greatly en
hanced by this confederation that the funds on which these debts
were dependant, and from which the interest on them was paid,
is nowaflumed by the United States. The impost and excise un
der the management of the individual States was barely fufficient
for this purpose ; they have now nothing left, but the excise,
which is found to be very^inproduftiveâthe consequences of di
rest taxation have been severely felt. lam cleatly of opinion that
if WÂ£ do not make this aflumption, the verv existence of this go
vernment will be endangered ; the competition for revenue will
excite such heats and animosities, as will destroy revenue alt<?,
gether.
He concluded by wishing that the fubje& might be taken up on
fair and equal principlesâand from thence he doubted not, it
would appear a measure of indispensable neceflity and justice to
adopt the proportion for the assumption.
WEDNESDAY, APRIL 20.
Sundry petitions were read.
A Committee was appointed on Col. Ely's memorial.
In committee of the whole on the Report of the Secretary of
the Treasury for the support of the public credit.
The 2d alternative,* in the following words was read, viz. -
To have the whole sum funded at an annuity or yearly interest of
4 per cent, irredeemable by any payment exceeding five dollars pr.
annum, on account both of principal and interest, and to receive
as a compensation for the redu&ion of interest, fifteen dollars and
eighty cents, payable in lands as in the preceding cafe.
It was moved toftrike out " five dollars" in order to admit a
larger sum, so that the ledemption of the principal should take
place at an earlier period than that proposed. This was agreed to,
and Six inserted.
The following propofin<JÂ«t 66J dollars funded im
mediately at an annuity w y*Wly interest ol o per cent, irredeema
ble by any payment exceeding four dollars and two thirds of a
dollar, pr. annum, on account both of principal and interest ; and
to have at the expiration of ten years 26 dollars, and 88 cents,
funded at the like intcreft and rate of redemption." The propor
tion being amended to read as follows, was agreed to.
" To have 66Â§ dollars funded immediately at an annuity or
yearly intcreft of fix per cent, irredeemable by any payment ex
ceeding fix dollars and two thirds of a dollar per annum, on ac
count both of principal and interest ; and to have, at the end of
seven years, thirty-three dollars and one third of a dollar funded
at the likeintereil and rate of redemption."
Mr. Sherman then proposed to modify the rcfolution so as
admit of the following propositionâ u That the debts contra&ed
by the several states for the common defence and benefit of the
union, ought to be confidercd as a part of the domestic debt of

Mr. Madison made the following motion : Mr. Speakrr
As we have been informed not only through the channel o l '
the newspapers but by a more c\trect communication, of (| h .
decease of an illustrious charatlej-, whop.* native genius has rendn
ed diftinguilhed ferviees to the cauie of faience and ot mankind m
general; and whose patriotic exertions have contributed in a h;<r>,
degree to the independence and prosperity of this country in par.
ticularâthe occasion seems to call upon us to pay iome tribute to
his memory exprcflive of the" tender veneration his countrv fp f \
for such diltinguifticd meritâl therefore move the Lollowmg r.%
solution :
" The house being iniormcd of-the deccnfr of K NjA-i
MIN Franklin, a citir.etr 4ho ft native g< v us was not
more an ornament to human nature. than his various exer
tions of it have been precious to fc-ience, to freedom,and
to his country, do refold, as a mark of the venerat ion due ,
to his memory, that the member* wear the cultoinary
badge of mourning for one month."
On the question f thii motion paflfea without a division.
Mr. Partridge brought in a bill for allowing compenfatioofo I
John Ely, which was read a firft t:me.
Mr. Gilman of the committe- of enrolment, reported
that the committee had examined the bill entitled an ast fortfe
punilhment of certain crimes the United States ; v<hcr C .
upon, the speaker signed the said bill.
In committee of the whole on the report of the Secretarjof

prayer of the petition: Mr. Partridge ftatingthe circumftau

that the sum of 3801. be granted to General lames barren,
in full for so much {hort paid him on a warrant cfrawn inlrsfj.
vor on the state of Maflachufetts ; this motion was feeonded by !
Mr. Gerry, who likewise spake to the merits of the petition.
The question being taken, the motion was negatived.
Mr. AMEs,ffÂ»id, that previous to taking up the order of
the dav, he wished to introduce a rrrot ion for the confidcratiofl
of the house ) he ohferved that it had been ailVrted in the :ourtc
of the debates riif the sffumption of the State debt?, thnt the State
of Virginia had.advanced for the common defence, beyond he
proportion s advantage appeared to be taken of such alfcruons;
ht thought it npcefTary that faÂ£ls fhoula he knownâtn3t thecotr
mittee might ast with certainty in cOuduftingthisimportantcjiie!-
tion ; he therefore moved the followirig in fubftanre, viz-'Thlt
the Sopretaryinr ths rÂ°" Â»
the house a statement of the troops including the militia, and ord
nance stores furnifhed by the rcfpeft'.ve States for the df
fence, during the late war.âThis motion was opposed 3S tend
ing to procrastinate the funding business, and as leading to ex
cite invidious companfons rcfpeÂ£iip-g the relative merits ana exer
tionsof theX/cveral States.ââlt was however carried in the affir
mative, with this addition piopofed bv Mr. Bland, " ana that
the CommifTioners of acfctfurtts between the Staff? an
individual states, be dire&ed to furnifh an abftraft. ofrhe dim
ofthe several states against: the United States, fpecifviugtaeprm
ciples on which the claims are founded. On the aboverao
tion. the previous question was called for by Mr. Lee, wit.
was loft, and the main question agreed to,-28 to 26.
Mr. Gerry then moved, that the Secretary of the Treajon' f
directed to report to the house a statement of all payments sot 0
Indents and other paper, as well as specie which have hecni? e
by the several states to Congrefsfrom the commencement
eod of the late war, This was agreed to.
Mr Madison moved that a statement ol the !
ofthe several ftatesagainft the United States, should befurn.w
by the Commiflioner? âthis was also agreed to.
The above report of the Secretary of the Treasury is veryfl.
nute and lengthyâthe reading of it and the debates 011 0
motions employed the whole dayâso that the House did not -
into Committee.

form of government in a monarchical country
and how much more difficult Hill to remedy the
vices of government in a republicâbut he wiffi
cd they would immediately undertake it, and
communicate to him the plan of a new fyltem.

I hat nobles and commoners may be made capa

with sentiments of equity and justice, to fliew to
the aflembly that the edid: of 1787, concerning
the non-catholics* excluded those citizens from
places in the municipalities, which comprehend
those of judicature ; that the decisions of the as
sembly not having abrogated that law, it might
be used in the formation of the municipalities as
well as of the aflemblies of diftritft and depart
ment, againlt citizens meriting the fame rights with
others. He therefore moved that the National As

Mr. Vandernoot, their leader, have great mer
it for their sincere efforts to prevent all excefies.
He ,s chosen President ofthe General Committee
ofthe Belgic Provinces. People now begin to look
forward to the future form to be given to our
government. Some think, as the Prince is depri
ved of h:s rights, the Sovereignty reverts to the
people, and does notfurvive as a property to the
tew m poffeflion of itâthat the right of reprefen
particularly flmuld be equalizedâthat the
difhntftion of orders should be fuppreflbd, or it
would be only a change of mailersâothers think
that the Ducal power being abrogated in the per
son of the Emperor, the States, as at present form
ed, are entitled to continue in the government,
and that they muff not give into the dangerous
novelties of their neighborsâit may happen that
the consequences oft his revolution may be more

prising rapidity down the sleep, making a tre

MR. FENNO,
r T" , HE pitriots of America were little more weary of the dangers
1 and etlorts of a state of war, than of the confufions, dilgraces
and gloomy forebodings which succeeded it. That liberty which
cost such efforts, and was worth more than it cost, teemed ready
.to expire â¢; property was deemed insecure ; the union had no
thing hut opinion to support it ; a charm which was losing its
force by time, and the accumulated causes of internal hostility.
IVhile , New-York was taxing Conuefticut and New-Jeriey, aud
part of Maflachufetts, and MafTachufetts, was taxing a part of Con
vieÂ£fcicut, and almost all New-Hampftitrc; while each accused the
other of delinquency during the war, and of injustice iince the
peace, all men of difceriiment saw with grief and terror the rapid
progress of things towards a state of civil war. 1 hank Heaven !
it is only a matter ot opinion; but that opinion is little ihort of
plenary evidence, that before this day the flames of civil war
would have been kindled. The high spirit ot Conne&icut could
ill brook the being tributary to New-Yoik. It is said that more
than one hundred thousand dollars were drawn yearly by this
Jattei state from its neighbours. Trade fuffered under rival regu
lationsâmutual interconrfe was (hackled, and would soon have
been interdicted. Navigation and manufactures funk under the
-weight of foreign oppreflion ; all this time property was unfafe ;
-we bluftied for our country, while we trembled for its fafety.
When we adopted the Constitution, we justly relied upon the
â wisdom of its principles, and, perhaps flill more, upon the zeal of
its advocate* for an efficient and stable administration. What were
the defetts of the old form of government ? It was well enough
nn paper ; but in pra&ice it was a piece of mockery. Congress
had the fwxjrd, it h true ; but a f\vord that must be kept in the
icabbord till the rust had conlumed its edge. The States had each
a sword too, and what was better, a purse, and in that purse some
of the States kept their own and their neighbour's money : It was
a house divided against itfelf; it was a constitutional mob ; a chaos
xnade more confufed toy attempting to arrange it into order ; a per
petual conflict between constitution and administration ; it was
â worse than a state of nature in which each man is against his fel
low ; for here petty societies were ranged against one another; it
<wai order against order government against government; it was
a kind of feudal anarchy in which the social priuciple was per
verted to make the mifchiefof individual paflions more permanent
and deadly.
Those who believe in providence ought to thank heaven upon
their knees that we have escaped from a condition which afforded
no hope but in the extremity of the evil; that extremity produced
the constitution ; while it was in difcuflion, it was admitted that
â¢without the complete power of the purse, the government would
he a lhadow ; it would cheat the hopes of those who expe&ed
prote&ion from it.âFor let it be remembered, a feeble govern
ment is a curse to a country ; for the paflions of men are con
ikantly struggling to escape the restraint of laws ; a government
too weaJt to rellraio these paflions becomes the instrument of
them.
Government is to foeiety what reason is to the foul; when the
authority of either is impaired, vice and ruin will ensue ; it is too
often said government is an evil : good government makes men
better than it finds them.âBy impofiog an habitual restraint upon
the paflions, they lose much of their ferocity, and reason be
comes superior ; under good government man is a taught animal,
and gains more than all otheis by ditcipline.
Every feeble government on earth is a government of men, and
of bad men too, and not of hws ; the worst paflvon? are the tnoft
a&ive, and will gain the ascendency ; liberty if it can be called
such is then the moil infccure. Thofc who poflefs, are made wea
ry of it; its champions renounce its defence for its spoil. We
form societies for the fake of security ; a government too weak to
give it, is not worth preserving, and yet it must be preserved, if
at all, by the painful watching, and at the conllant peril of its ad
vocates.
We have gathered the ripe fruits of experience ; we have seen
the union prostrate; Congress with no more power and liule more
dignity than the trustees of a charity school ; we have supported
a government without having one ; allegiance and prote&ion said
to be reciprocal were rcverfed ; the government was prote&cd,
and paid homage to the State*.
The question on the ailumption involves all thefeconfederations;
if the State debts are notto be paid, it is a measure of violence and
wickcdncfs that Algiers would abhor. If they are to be paid at
acf. in the pound, and the States are to tax as they think lit to do
it, they mull occupy the principal sources of revenue ; these par
tial taxes will be dimcult to manageâthey will be various in the
Statesâ(yftem will oppose fyftemâconfufion will ensue. The
people will pay much and the States get little. Besides the lofi
of money, it is bringing our government back to the confedera
tion. It is in practice what that was in theory.
Citizens qf Americaâyou have not expe&ed another confede
rationâyou have cheerfully adopted the conftvtutionâyou havÂ«
freely aided the government âyou have prospered beyond exam
ple under itâyoyr itjduftiy, if not obftru&ed, will lead you to
"wealth.âAre you willing then by dividing the exercise of indi
rect taxation between Congress and the States, to endanger all
your hopes ? Revenue is power, and will not bear a partnership.
You will fee revived the deadly animosities which rival trade
jaws engendered in the States ; the arts will languishâthe union
â will be relaxedâthe graces of your heroes will be inoiftened with
the blood of ihejr brethren.âls there in the world a government
â where the powers in question are exercised in partnerlhip ?â
If there is a bad government, and not worth what it costs.
Philadelphia, April 20,1700.
Died on Saturday night, in the 85th year of his age> the iflujlriovs
NjfAMJN FRANKLIN, of this city. His remains xvillbe interred
to morrow afternoon, atfour -o'clock, in Chrijl Church burial ground.
We are favored with the following (hort account of Do&or
Franklin's last illness, by his attending Physician.
THE /lane, with which he had been afflielcd for Jeveral years, had for
the lafl twelve months confined him chicflx to his bed; and during the ex
treme parnful paroxysms, he was obliged to take large doses of laudanum
to mitigate his torturesâflill, in the intervals of pain, he not only amu
sed ktmfeifwith rending and cOnvgrJibg cheerfully zcith his family and a
fewfriends, who visited him, but was often employed in doing bufiiefs of
ii public as well as <: private'nature, with varions persons, who waited on
him for that purpose ; and in every injlance df played, not only that rea
ding's and difpojition of doing good, which was the diflinguifhing cha
rall r eriliic oj h<s life, but theful/ejl and clearefl pojfeffion of his uncom
mon mental abilities ; and not frequently indulged him fdf in those jeux
d'efprits and entertaining anecdotes, which were the delight ej all who
heard him.
About sixteen days before his death, he mas seized with a fevcrifh in
disposition, without any particularfymtoms attending it till the third or
fourth day, when he complained of a pain in his left breafl, which increa
sed till it became extremely acute, attended with a cough ayd laborious
breathing. During this [late, when the severity oj his pains sometimes
drew forth a groan of complaint, he would obferve âthat he was afraid
he did not bear them as he oughtâacknowledged his gratefulfenfe of tht
many blrfjings he had received from that Supreme Being, who had raised
him,jrom small and low beginnings, to such high rank and confederation
among menâand nude no doubt his present ajfliftions were kindly
tended to wean him from a world, in which he was no longer ft to ail the
part affignedhim.
In (his frame of body and mind he continued till Jive days before his
deaih% when his pam and difficulty 6f breathing entirelyllet him, and his
fornilx were flattering thenifehes with the hopes of his recovery, when an
impojlhumaticn, which had formed iff!fin his lungs, fuddenlyburfl, and,
dfcharged a grea.; quantity of matter, which he continued to throw
up while he hadfujjicicrrt frength to do it, but, that failed the organs
of rtfpiratun became gradvatjy oppreJ[edâa calm Uthargicjlatcfucctti
edâand on the 17M, about 11 o'clock at night he quietly expired, clojtng
a long and ufefut life of 84 vears and 3 months.
It may net be amiss to add to the above account that Dr, Franklin, in
the year 1735, had a severe pleurisy, which determined in an abfcejs of
the left lobe of his lungs, and he was then almojl fujfocated with the quan*
tity and fuddennfs of the discharge. A second attack of ajimilar nature
happened some years after this, from which he soon recovered, and did
not appear tofujfer any inconvenience in his respiration from these dif-
tufa.
NATIONAL ASSEMBLY.
Paris, February 12
SUPPRESSION OF MONACHISM !
At length the mighty exploit of civil prowess is
atchieved-âthe national aliembly of France, al
ter a debate of two days, in which reason and e
loquence combated againlt bigotry and clamor,
have adopted the following memorable decree :
" The National Ailembiy decrees, as a consti
tutional article, that the law (hall not authorize
monadic vows from persons of either sex ; declares
in consequence, that all religious orders which
exadt such vows, are and shall for ever continue
fupprefl'ed in Franee, to the exclufionof any fiini
lar eftablifliments in future.
" All the religious of either sex may, on mak
ing a declaration to their municipality, quit their
cloister, and proper pensions fhallbe without de
lay provided for their support, as well as houses
of retreat for those who do not desire to avail
tliemfelvesof the liberty granted.
" The Aflembly excepts houses charged with
education or charity, until it (hall finally decide
concerning these objedis. The nuns may remain
in their own convents, the National Aflembly ex -
prefsly excepting them from the operation of
that decree which enjoins the union of several
houses into one.
M. L'Abbe Montefquiou was the author of the
decree we have reported above, which was carri
ed by a great majority.

world, is the axe at length laid to the root of that
tree which in its baneful lhade nourished so ma
ny noifonie reptiles, while it withered the blos
soms of humanityâwhich has folong impoverish
ed the nutriment of industry by its growth, and
so widely darkened the views of intelle# by its
luxuriance. â 
LONDON, Febuary 10.
Population.âln a late calculation it appears
that there are inâ
A few days ago a young couple went to be mar
ried at A(hton-uiider-Line ; when the ceremony
was about to commence, the lady walked out of
the church ; the gentleman, with much appa
rent eagerness, followed her ; in the inoft tender
manner, intreated her to return and make him
happy, to which {he at length consented. When
again in the church, and at the altar, the intend
ed bridegroom made a moil obfeqnious bow,
wished her a good day, and left her.
A fellow at Windsor, who lately ate a cat, has
given another proof of the brutality ofhisdifpo
litionâan instance too ferocious and sanguinary
almost, to admit of public repcl'entation.
He was at a public lioufe at Old Windsor, one
day in tliecourfe of last week, and, without ap
parent cause, walked out of the house, and with a
bill-hook fevered his hand from bis arm. His
brutal courage was strongly marked in this tranf
a<ftion; for the inhuman monlter made q strokes
with the instrument before he could effedl his
purpose, and at last actually made a complete
amputation. He assigns no other reason for this
terrible felf attack, than his total disinclination
to work, and that this step will compel the over
leers of his parifli to provide for him during the
remainder of his life.
UNION.
The STARLING. A Song.
(From the Concord Gazctlt,)
A BEAUTEOUS Starling late I saw
On lovely Sylvia's hand ;
To check his flight, around his leg
She ty'd a silken band :
In vain he flutters to be gone ;
Confinement is his lot :
In vain he drives to break the bandâ
And can't untie the knot.
Cease ! cease ! (he criedâhere you (hall feed ;
And in my bosom reft :
No bird that ever wing'd the air,
Was half so much carefs'd.
If from my hand you (hould escape,
You may per chancc be (hot :
Then cease to peckâ'tis all in vain'â
You can't untie the knot.
The Bird contented grows, at length,
While Sylvia strokes his plumes ;
Ere&s his little crestâand loon
His former notes resumes.
From what he'd heard the fair one fay,
These words by rote he got;
And oft repeated every day,
You can't untie the knot.
One ev'ning youthful Damon fat,
With Sylvia by his fide k ;
Reward my love at last, said he,
To-morrow be my bride.
Her blurtiesin his tavor rose ;
Yet flie consented not ;
For ere she spake, the Starling criedâ
You can't untie the knot,
