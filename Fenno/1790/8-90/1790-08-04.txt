Fes -with the Dutchefs of Valentincis, who had
pofiefled the heart of the late Kinj;, to the time
of his death. The occasion was piefling, and the
importance of the bulinefs would not admit ot
delay. On one hand the Queen, to whom dif
fiin ulation was not difficult, agreei.l to appear, to
forget the past, with the fame moderation which
(lie had (hewn, in bearing with J;eÂ» rival during
the life of her hulband : On the.jUther, the Gui

easily betrayed their friend, by -mfenting that
the Outchefs fliould be disgraced and difmitled
from the CourtâThey only required that she
flioujd not be totally ltripped of those immense
riches, which mult one day revert to the Duke
ofAuinale, their brother.
The King of Navarre, was then al>fent, and
very discontented witli the King and the Court,
who, in the treaty concluded with Spain, had
given no attention to his interelts, nor to the rcf
citution of his States. The new coalition at Court
had, with great address, diflembarrafled them
(elves of the Conltable, by deputing him to do
the honors of the obsequies of Hciirv the fecoml.

the second, seduced by the careiles and the charms
of his Scottish Queen, an arrangement by which
heplaced the reins of government, in the hands
of his nearcft relations. JLvery thing which con
cerned the war, was committed to the Duke ot
Guile. The Cardinal had tlis departments of
Julticeand Finance âami the Queen mother the
luperintendance of all parts of the government.

the jealousy, which for a long time had openly

the fall of his favour at court, the reputation of
his wisdom, preserved him a great influence
throughout the whole kingdom. In 'heirieciet

NATIONAL ASSEMBLY
â¢" ' y
THIS day the Count tie Mirabeau piapofed ti
he Aflt-inbly an amendment of one of the articles
A' the decree on the right of making peace and
tvar, -viz. " That no treaties that lhould be at
my time entered into with foreign powers, whe
ther of commerce or alliance, lhould be valid, till
ratified by the National Aflembly." This amend
ment was agreed to. He then proposed an ad
ditional article, viz. " That all treaties, or con
ventions, that had been entered into with foreign
powers in the King's name, down to the present
time, IhalJbe examined by a special Committee,
chosen by the Aflembly, who lhall, previous to
the end of the present session, make a report
thereon, to the end, that the Aflembly may de
termine which of them ought to be ratified, and
to what extent they ought to continue in force-
This article meeting with general disapprobation,
M. de Mirabeau consented to withdraw it, and
the question was adjourned.
Two letters were then read from the Munici
pality of Montauban, stating that tranquility
was restored in that city, that the National
guard was new modelled, and that the Protestants
forgetting their difaflers, were intent on contri
buting tothe happiness of the people. The Mu
nicipality eypreilcJ r- Â«tÂ«. ...btj-*
on the bad consequences offending a detachment
of the militia of Bordeaux to Montauban, and re
quelled the Aflembly to coiilider the subject, and
make a new decree. The two letters were or
dered to the Committee ofÃrports.
PROVIDENCE, JULY 24.
Last Saturday afternoon we had loine rain
here, attended with sharp lightning. The wind
blew heavy in the bay, ana one vefiel was in
danger of fouoderingat her anchors. The lloop
Venus, of Norwich, bound from hence to New
port, came to anchor under Warwick neck, and
was afterwards ftrnck by a fla/h of lightning,
that tore off several feet of her mast, which, with
the rigging, went overboard ; the remainder of
the malt was ffiivCred, the splinters flying to a
cooliderable diltance, and several buts above wa
ter were started, but providentially none of the
people were injured. She was next day towed
into Newport.
A correspondent at Rehoboth informs, that in
the thunder-storm on Saturday afternoon the
lightning struck a row of button-wood trees, in
to which vails had been let for fence, within
three rods of the house of Dr. Samuel Allen,
and ran from tree to tree upon the fence, shiv
ering the rails, throwing fpliiuers many rods in
all directions, and ploughing the ground in se
veral places. Its effects were discoverable on 13
of the trees. Five men that had been reaping,
and who were within a few rods of the place, as
nlfo the people in the honfe, Iclt a Considerable
{hock, but happily no person wis Hurt.
An excellent niachinefarclearingdocks, deep

THE TABLET No. CXXXVII.
" Uis impoffiblc to love a seCond time the thing that we have once truly
ceajed to love."
WITHOUT examining whether this maxim be true in all
cases, 1 will A:left a few in wiii'ch its tiuth can
not be queflioned. I believe it will beconfeffed that a man, who
has dace loft his attachment to his country, cannot afterwards
view it with any degree of complaccncy. That men do not love
their country from any abftratt reasoning about its merit, appears
from this circumitance, that the inhabitants of the worit country
in the world may be ardently attached to it; and those of the belt
country may be violently averse to it. The mod powerful and
univertal cauie of love to any country, is, a residence in it, at that
period ot liic whtuftrft impreflionsare formed, and when the force
of example is strong and irrefutable. Such a glow ot affc&ion
may be excited in favor of a local situation, that it will require an
extraordinary incident to eradicate it. The difficulty of destroy
ing this attachment conftuutes the difficulty of reviving it. The
foul cannot cafily torget the agitation it mnft have been thrown
into, by so violent a cause, as that whjch can extinguish the love
of country. A man, who from an inherent perverfenefs of heart,
becomes a traitor to his country, must ot courfc lose his love of
Â»t r because being perpetually-conscious that he is hated, ana de
fervts to be so, his own feelings must acquire a congenial cast. In
like manner, a perfoij >#ho fertoudy believes, he has received some
flagrant injury front l>if country, may be so irritated by a sense of
Ins wrongs, that his totally absorbs every delightful
(en fa lion in its favor. iHis former aftVdlions become transformed
into hatred and revenge and he can never enjoy any impulses of
pairiotifm afterward.
I It isan observation no less true than common, that the mod
violent and lasting disputes exist among those who were once in
I habits of the ftri&eft intimacy and triendfhip. When friends
fcrioufly difagrec, it can only result from some circuinftance caJ
culatec to excite so high a degree of provocation as cannot easily
be forgotten. Family quarrels are, of all others, fiie moil bitter
and unrelenting. There may be a fulpenfion (of friendfhip upon
lome flight causes of disagreement, but this is very different from
those severe and deep-rooted enmities, which create in the heart
sentiments of real difgufi and malevolence. Thcfe Once formed
in the breaftsof persons, who have formerly been on a footing of
cofdial esteem and good wilj, will perhaps never be eradicated.
I he maxim contained in the motto may therefore be true as it ap
plies to a friend ; that we can never love bim a second time, whom
we have once truly ceased to love. This view of the iubje& ftiould
induce us to guard againlt chtrifhing any causes of diiguft either
againlf our friends or our country ; for it is a moil melancholy,
as well as a most difgraceful circumstance to have a heart in which
the fentimerits of patriotism or friendfhip delight not to dwell.
CONGRESS.
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
FRIDAY, JULY 23.
Dcbals on the Anicn4m:nt of the Senate to the Fund
ing lit//, to afume a part of the State Debts.
Mr. Jackson.
The second argument of the genile.nan is, that kmr States
have taken upou themfelvcs greater Sums than then/ propyl
tions or abilities to pay.
This, Sii, I think dubious, nor can it be ascertained but bv a
settlement of accounts, which alone can determine. But Sir
let us examine on the principles of equity, the claims of the two'
States which complain the motl, Massachusetts and South-Caro
lina. The forni.-r has, it is fmd, greatly 7 exceeded her quotn. The
fair method to jud ;e of this, is to compare her exertions during
the war with her ability. This foiid principle of judging, has
been loft fight of, although contended for, when the bill tor the
settlement of accounts was before the house. At the commence
ment of the war there is no doubt but the citizens of Massachu
setts in and near Bolton, fullered cor.Gderabiy ; but from the eva
cuation of that city to the end of the war, the felt the advantages
rather than the difadv linages of warâShe carried on the medium
of commerce for the Unionâher merchants and her country of
cotirfe were enrichedâihe became enabled therefore to make
greater c xertions, and no doubt did her part. Contrail this with
some others of the Slat'sâoverrun by the enemy houl'es and
plantations destroyedâcommerce arrettedâmerchants and citi
zens totally ruined, and the mod opulent families beggaied. I
will leave to the ger.tltfmen from Malfachufeus themftlvesâl will
appeal to their candot to determine tf their debt was double the
amount, which was thp better fate.
South-Carolina I shall however be told is on the other scale
and in a great mcafure, I will grant it.
The <: .faculties of that State have been greatâthe merits of her
citizens many, and her fufferings out of proportion with mot!
hut not all of the States. North-Carolina and New-Jerky fuf'
tcred nearly as much, and Georgia more. A great proportion of
the wealth of South-Carolina was preserved by persons who took
proteaion, or who resided in Europe the greatefl part of the war
âthis was not the cafe with Ceorgia, her ci'izens were totally
beggared, and her country left a wild uninhabited defart â  few of
those who took proteflion remaining. That wealth preserved
lett South-Carolina yet in a State of arllucnce- the would in the'
former Congrtfs have felt hcrfclf infultcd >1 the had beru consider
ed second in refourcc Â» any State in the Union. She is as -reat
now inrefource, and I btlicve that I speak wiih iuftire wVn I
advance that of the back inhabitants of that Sta c are
oppof.d to the meafcre Sir, they are republicans who hav.
fougi t and bled for the cause ot liberty, and know the value ol ,t
I know and regard them, such, and although I wish not to wound
the feelings of any gentleman prefer,t, I assert that they will fee
through this thin veiled artifice to take their poruon of Statepow
er from them, and they will feci that continual drain ol foecie
which muftt,kc place to fatisfy the appetites ot balking fmcula
tors at the feat of government.
The 3 cl. argument is t hat the funds out of which those debts
ought to be paid, are by the conftuution put under the direftuih
of the federal eovernmem, and this done by the people for the
express purpose of paying the debts of the United States ot which
tnele are a part#

The - sth argument ofÂ»the gentleman if it is notTully refuted
my reply to his firft and second, can be easily accomplifhcd.
It is, that equal jultice ought to be done to all the creditors, buc
this cannot be done by individual States ; Come of them bcin r un
able to make provifiow ; burthened beyond their quju, ana de
prived of former revenues.
By the prtfent mode, the argument is defeated, for the credit
ors are not on a footingâthe whole .is not alfumedâj proportion
will therefore still be left to the mercy of the States, which ma/
be as backward in their payments now, as formerly. Without
the alfumption at all, the diftin&ion was not hard to be borne.
Jlt was to be borne. It was only b tween the Slate creditors and
those of the Union. At present, the diftinÂ£tion is between the
lame State creditorsâthose who will benefit are the speculators
rtear the feat of government, and those near the commiflioncrs -
| whilst thole at a distance and who in moil probability arc the on-,
i ly original holders, will not be benefited. The creditors of one
State are not even on a footing with those of another. Maflachu
! setts, South and North-Carolina, have the one half of 21,000,000
allotei them the two former havt? near their whole debt. I
will call on gentlemen to know if any within this house, can/up
pofe they have a ballance of 10,000,000 due them ? The amount
of the debt of Georgia is more than was supposed, it amounts to
ftven hundred thoulaud dollar*âthree hundred ihoufand of which
are onlv to be aflumed. If the measure is wile, the whole
lo be assumed.
I am not for this partial methodâeither the assumption ought
to be proportioned Co the rtprcft .Ation, or gem-rally, or
certificates ought to issue to the States for what they have funk as
to individuals.
Thf 6th argument is, that the measure is founded in good po
licy, as well as justice, as it will promote harmony amonj credit
ors and d.ffercnt States, attach them to the government and facil
itate operations.
That it is not founded in justice I think has been pretty well
fhewnâlts policy was clearly proved at a former day, to have
been a consolidation of the government ; and Sir, I believe with
it a consolidation of the people's liberties.âThe object certainly
was the absorbing the whole of the Slate powers within the vor
tex ol the all devouring general governmentâseven years were we
[fighting to establish props for liberty, and in leli than two years,
finer the adoption of the conftitntion, arc we trying to k.ck them
all -away, and he is the ablest politician and the be ft man of the
day, who can do 1110 ft to deilroy the child of liberty ot his own
ratfing. A friend Sir, to ihe Slate governments, or the liberties
of the people, is as much loft at the present day, as if he had be
onged to the last century, and had a refurre&ioa in the present
Â°" C
Sir, il so much of this patriotlfra is loft near the feat of go
vernment, let us not fuppofe-it is the cafe with the whole of the
United SlatesâThe Slates will not tamely submit to a nuafure cal
culated todiftrefs, and manifeftly founded in injjifticeand the ru
in of the State governments.âSo far will it be fiom producing the
harmony the gentleman has supposed, that I thinii I cai. venture
to prophesy, it will occafjon discord and generate rancour againlt
the Union. For it it brucfits inn patt of the United Sta-es, it op
press another. If it lulls the Shayfes of the north, u will route
the Sullivans ofthefouth. (To be ccntinaci.)

a (mall stream issues from the fpring,'excepting when the wind
continues to blow from the North-Weft, for more than two days

yards from the river, and is very Utile elevated above the furiace
of the water in the river, perhaps four or five feet (by estimation.)
It is in a frnall valley or gully, vet not in the lowest part ; the

FOR THE GAZETTE OF THE STATES.
MS. FENNO,
AS I live near 300 miles from the feat of government, in this
part of the country we depend upon your Gazette, for in
formation refpefling our national government.
The Funding Bill, as reported in committee of the Senate, ap
pears to everyone in this quarter to be, in one particular at lead,
extremely wrong, viz.ârating interrji below principal. We think
it violates all the%ftablilhcd principlesof equity, and the common
fenfc of mankind.
id. It has ever been eonfidered that intered was at lead as good
as principal, in all pablic and private contrasts and ncgociations ;
and in cases where the intered was not duly paid, v as in the pre
sent cale), justice required compensation for fucli delay of pay
ment. 2d. Going upon the universal principle of mankind, ina-
Tiy foldierr, and others, being under the neceflity of felling fom
of their securities, they fold principal ; supposing, if government
made any provision for payment, it would firflbe for the inter, ft ;
and they were confirmed in this belief, by the t&xcj whith Con
crefs required to be paid in Indents. 3d. Foreign purchases, have
been of the principal, therefore the bill is calculated to â¢enrich fo
reigners by injnrin r our people âand in violation of all the fit '-
biifhed maxims of jufticeâconfequeii'.ly the government would be
eonfidered as capricious, and must fink in the ejlimation of wife
men, at home and abroad, 4th. If the revenue is not equal to the
wants of government, let equal justice be done, and the wife and
good through the world, will juftify our mcafurcs âbut such par.

rrnort of the Secretary met with the approbation of the people,
as'it was calculated to do equal justice, pnd conformable to the
date of our countryâ(and it is th- general opinion through eight
of the dates, where I have travelled within two months pall, that
if the Secretary's report had been adopted five months ago, the
advantages to the United State* by this time, would have been
million", as thereby the fecuritics would have risen, and the vast
sums Burchafcd by foreigner , would have brought so much more
money into the country). 6.h. Eveiy debt, due in money, whe
tbn for I'upplies, pel foual Cervices, for intend, or tor any thing
else, where the faith of government has been pi dged, or juflice
and honor requires payment, is eonfidered by all impartial men
as equal -and whenever government fund or pay their debts,
(here can be no diftinaion. These arc the prevailing sentiments
of the people of eery class, and thev are undoubtedly founded
in the reason of things, consequently ought never to be departed
from. .
We thitfk, Mr. Printer, it is neceffjry that the opinion ot com-
Tnon people, tar from the feat of govcrnmrn!, Oiould be pub'.ifoed
as well as the feotinunts of the learned in the great cities ; for
good rulers with to know the Centiments of the people and when
government proceeds upon rÂ»ne plain and eqoal feale, the people
can ke the line of jail lcc, and wiiHove au/t support the govern
ment. But ifone man's certiorate for money dueto him from the
public, is made more valuable than another man's, tor ?.b equal
sum, wh.o can think, it right ? A SOLDIER.

"The discouragement afidsjloom folately pre
valent here, has now given way to the spirit of j
a<ffive preparation and bustle. The cause is the
new alliance formed by the Porte with Pruflia.
The iniidiiltrwn now entertain the most fatignine
lopes that the aTiftance of Pruflia will enable
them to repair the lodes fuffered in the late cam
paign with Ruflia a.d Auftrja. The thirst of
battle fully pofiefles the Mahometans : Abun
dance of recruits flock in everyday, and are im
mediately drafted off to some particular deflina

appearance of zeal and ardour among the peo
pie : Nor are the common people only eager to
teflify their zeal ; fcvcral opulent individuals
have made offer: ot logrcat presents to the Sultan,
as to enable him to defray the expenccs of the
â¢war. These, however, the Sultan refnfed ; al
ledpiifg that he does not want tor them, and that
his refourtfes are fhfficient for the war ; a third
campaign, therefore, is inevitable.

Dr. Franklin recommends, in one of his let |
ters, what he calls " Air Bathing," or riling ear

half an hour, or an hour, accordingto the iealon.
In confirmation of the Dr's idea, is daily exper

from leaving off a thick garment and putting on
a thin one, provided it is done in the morning.
A correspondent who has pradt'.fecl on the Dr s
plan recommends it to thole invalids who have
found the shock from fea-batbing too severe for
