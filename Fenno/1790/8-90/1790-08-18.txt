" In vain," faidthey, " fkall wc wait for thi

and the Guises, he will never dare to re demaiu
the power which he has so blindly abandoned ti

Princes otf the blood, and the nobles, the belt at

CONTINUATION
A CENTURY ago, an attempt to violate the
shred of a prielt's garment would have been
deemed the highest impiety but that happy
period is long pall. A new fed of philofopliers
has brought all the present calamities 011 France,
by insidiously varying and adapting their wri
tings to the talle, and conaprehenfion, of all ranks
of fuciety. They have perverted their under
(landings and corrupted their morals, by fatal y
perfuÂ»-cfiiig them that jufltice and benevolence
were the etfential duties ol*irfan, and that -with
out bewildering t hemic! ve* in the tr. zing pei
plexities and inextrkable mysteries of theology
they fbould "look through nature up u> nature .
God." Tliey have rent the facrcd veil asunder
md falfely and prefuinptuouily taught, that al
jower originates from the people ; âthat King:
ire only the firft magiflrates ot the ltate, and in
lebted to the meaneit peasant for the splendour
iiagnificence, and majesty that surrounded them
md that the greatett and tneaneft fubjedt rtioulc
>e equally bound, and equally protected by the
aws. Under the specious pretext of checking
md exposing superstition and bigotry, they have
jrofanely maintained, that the ordination of the
jrielt does not alter the nature of the man ; and
hat the I'ole utility of his function consists in in
truding the people in the moral and social du
ies ol'life. They havecalumniated the ambafla
lors of Heaven, by charging them with having
nonopolifed a third of the landed revenue of the
kingdom, by artfully working on the confcien
es of the weak and credulous, and extorting
rom them on the bed ot sickness, and even at
he hour of death, a share of their property, as a
propitiation of their fins. Their avowed princi
jles, fay these apoltles of impiety, their uniform
>rattice, the very spirit of their profeflion, mark
hem as implacable enemies to science, philolo
gy, and intelleeftual liberty. A constellation ol
renius teemed united in propagating these dan
rerous atheiitical tenets. I hey were diffuled in
â very species of writing, and the dulcet poilon

bined force aflailed and u..fettled the cm.fecr.t
ed opinions of ages. The venerable Gothic
ftrudlui e was shaken from US very foundation ,
the sacred edifice is now laid low, and the mac â 
ness of democracy has vainly dedicated a tempiS
to liberty on its ruins.
And arc we not at this instant menaced vrith
similar calamities, by a dangerous con.binatioa
of fanatical literati ? Have not our prophetical
Elijahs observed a cloud m the east pregnant
with inflammatory particles, and ju>* Â»eady to
bur ft on this devoted land .'-rfut to drop the
metaphor. Has not a cautbif*. gone forth
ing us, that churches are houses built of wood
and stone, which do not change their nature,
chough rendered holy by those fantftimomous ce
remonies wl.kh the hierarchy have ordained.
Are we not likewise told, that neither ep.fcopacy
nor tythc-s are of apostolic intfitution ; that bi
(hops arc notchofen by the people, but appointed
by the mockery of a royal conge d etir r.âAie
wc not told in this catechism, that the primitive
church con filled solely of the people, their lead,

then, have the effrontery to deny that the pair
ed character of the lords spiritual ,s depreciated,
and their sacred authority contemptuously treat
ed, in this abominable catechism ? 1s it not re.
commended by a plotting and dangerous synod,
consisting of four or five hundred turbulent he
retical non-conforn.ifts, who proudly denominate
themselves the Eastern AflocLatioii . * eir . Cl .\
tlifiartic zeal makes them truly formidable ; their
fame has gene forth intoall lands. 1 heii nuili
onaries have excited tumults and infurrechons at
Tibet and Constantinople ; for they deteit every
mode of ecclesiastical junction and equally
hate the Mufti, the grand Lama, and the Arclibi
fhop of Canterbury. Have not these catecliume
nical letftures been tranllated into all languages
Has not the present emperor of China illued an
ediJl to have them seized and burnt, with every
mark of iinominv, as containing fediuous and
irreligious dotSrines, highly injurious to the
rational and moral precepts ol Comucius i Ihe
great inquifjtorial council of Japan have pro
ceeded with their usual vindictive impetuofuy,
and have actually impaled fix of those lnifcluev
ouszealots, who were dispatched by the Kaltern
Aflociation, at an enormous expence, to difperte
this alarming tradf through every nation and
country under Heaven ! Nay, so inveterate is
the malignancy of this synod, that they have
lately made up this catechism into a l'pecific,
which, agreeable to their accustomed cant, they
call spiritual regenerating pills. These are pre
ferred to be taken by nurses, and women during
pregnancy ; that children may fuck in these
curled dotftrines with their n.ilk, the enibrio
ideas of infants be contaminated before they
are born, and a new (limulative be added to ori
ginal fin. By this diabolical invention, faction,
rebellion, and anarchy, may be difleininated oyer
the globe, and the flourifliing empires of China
and Japan be overturned by a future generation
of Arians, Socinians, Pelagians, Necellarians,
Antinomians, and Materialilts !
" The babe ett ytt he draws his vital breath,
" Receives the lurking principles of death ;
" The young difeife, that mud subdue at length,
" Grows with his growth,and ftrcngthcns with his {Ircnstb."
If some vigorous and coercive meafuresarenot
adopted to check tliefe audacious proceedings,
I would not give the nIPof a flra for our conlli
tution, in church andflate.
From the firft ages of Christianity, celibacy in
both (exes has been esteemed the sublimity of
virtue : its merit is derived from the difficulty
we feel, in this frail slate of mortality, in re
filling the inftindlive impulse of animal sensati
on. Hence, the monastic life became early the
divine test of corporeal purity, celestial fervor*
and fpritual devotion. But these new reform
ers have rashly absolved both monks and nunt
from the solemn vows by which they had devoted
themselves to heaven, and impiously encouraged
them to abandon their peaceful and landlimonioua
retreats, and expose themselves to the " pomps
and vanities of this wicked world, and the finful
lusts of the fle(h." However,it were well indeed
if the mifchief ended here ; âbut alas ! this fatal
step will eventually prove the ruin of England,
as it is calculated on the molt moderate computa
tion, that the fleets and armies of France may
soon be manned and recruited from this new
source of population. Their manufactures and
agriculture will no longer be diftrefledby a war,
[Whole No- 141.]as it may be carried on with vigor and facility
without calling a single man from the plough or
loom. Our nioft experienced statesmen, our wi
sest patriots, our most enlightened senators, are
convinced of this melancholy truth : The French
Revolution is therefore generally execratedâ
and has only ..received the contemptible plaudits
of an obscure society, composed of atheistical dif
fenters, republican deilks, and levelling free
thinkers, who impatiently long for the deftruc
tionof our civil and ecclesiastical eftabliflnnent.
1 he celebrated Mr. Neckerhas sagaciously ob
served, that it daily became more requisite than
ever, to inculcate the general dklatesof religion
on the minds of the people, as the only effeiftnal
consolation to support them under the weight of
oppretfive, unequal, and impoverishing taxation.
But the necellity ol'enforcing this pious dodlrine
is unhappily done away, as a redress of grievan
ces, and a rellorstion of rights have already taken
placeâand it is a melancholy truth, that rever
iionary felicity makes but a flight impression on
those who have a profpeift of enjoying the' Co
mforts of this life. ihe celestial fpecific so ear.
neftly recommended by Mr. Necker derives its
vital efficacy from theexertionsof arbitrary pow
er, which compels us to purchase eternal joy'by
a few years misery in this transitory ftateof pro
bation. Ihe prielthood, influenced bythisfacred
motive, have ever been the zealous advocates of
defpotifin, except when their own privileges and
immunities are endangeredâas in such a predic
ament, they are precluded from exercising their
own judgment, and only ast astrultees and dele
gates for the rights ofheaven.
The late emporer, Joseph theCreat, who afton
iflied the world by thefublimity of his genius and
the grandeur of his actions, not adverting to this
political axiom, seems to have committed a fatal
error, in not conciliating the affe<ftions, and fe.
curing the attachment of the church (and perhaps
the law) before he commenced his comprehen.

Austrian Nerheilainis.

Addrefi Â«J 3 ymng Lady ofJijtcen, on her ' leaving the Academy at
Bethlehem, Pennfy(vanid, June i, i7go.
BY one of the mod affettionate and attentive of patents was I
placed hert.âThe days appointed bv him,lor the completion
of my education, are numbered and Hnilhed.
With a heart, overflowing with the tendereft emotions, I now
rife to bid a long farewel Jo a neighborhood, from whom I have
experienced the most conftint a id friendly offices : To a focicty
who have as conflantly covered all my faults with the mant c of
love, as they have, whh a frieiuHy partiality, encouraged my pro
gress, by rn unifying my few im lovc-nentsâ to take a molt rcf
f dutilul leave ol.Tf;, h, ;â *, from vho ( n 1!>.)Â«Â« experien
ced eve., -ttemiein, ajid w<:iyKii;c.ti. :s ;to&m a t
companions, to whom I feel myfelf Sound with the strongest
co, Js of love and eftcem.
"n taking leave of ihii pcaceable, happy focietyj I beg thev
would believe me truly grateful for their many pledges of affec
tion ; and fully sensible of the advantages I have enjpved, in hav
ing my youth fofmed by such examples ol domestic economy
purity of morals, and reverence tor leligion.
In taking leave of you, my lovely and dear companions, I am
fupportcd by the plcafing reflexion, that the hill of Icience you
are now afccnding, presents profpefh the most hap D ily calculated
to alleviate a reparation from ypur relations and homes ; and that
the road is plarfted with every flower, which, perhaps, it is oof
fible for academic ground tu nurse. t speak from experience
having preceded you ia these rural scenes and fcientific walks!
Could I give form to fancy, or embody thought, each of you
would be delighiri with the piilure my three year's study here
lias impressed on my mind.
My lovely companions I If life be the bounty of heaven, to en
joy it rationally, is certainly the firft happiness of humanity - to
observe it with a virtuous delicacy, the peculiar felicity of our
feeble, dependant sex. 1 We are ,iot here managed to ride the
â whirlwind of th'oughtlefs dillipation. But in (hefe calm re
treats we arc taught lefTont which dignify the character of our
sexâentitle us to refpeft iÂ«j societyâand, if duly attended to, will
have a happy influence in rende-mg us accomplished and aereea
ble companions.
Separated we soon (hall be, by returning to our several heroes â 
yet, by indulging a retrofpea of the fcieÂ»ces we have here Itudil
cd togetherâof the plcafure we have experienced in the company
of each other; and the friend ships we have here contracted and
cementedâ(hall we not daily meet in this afytum of peace and
innocence? Wherever accident or circumllances may place us I
doubt not, but it will be our daily petition, that the perfons'of
thofc whose time has been so sacredly devoted for our benefit
may forever be encircled with the rays of a divine btnedi&ion
and, that into a fnurcc whence we have derived so many advantal
ges, a tide ol peace, success ?nd happirtefs, may forever
roll. 1
Amiable and beloved TutorrfTes I With what language (hall I
attempt to defcrihe the gratitude, with which my riling bosom
glows (oi all your tcndtincfs and .ill your care ? Weie lan ora
tor, and able.to ascend the highest ladder ol eloquence, I should
there need an Adam to give namrs to fenfattons which no lan
guage cau'now express.â If I have not improved, it cannot be
charged to your neglect.âShould your p.iruality tor mc, fuppofc
nie Dordermg on nnaccomphlhment, it is but a (mall return so'
your unremitted ottentions.
It is not necessary I (hould bringthefe, my lovely companions,
in the arms ot the love and friendlhip I feel for them, and present
them to your careâthey are already infolded in the bosom of
tour tendered affections. Could the personal virtues of leachets
enlure them luccefs, there would not be one in this lovely circle
but would answer the expeditions, and even the mod sanguine
wishes, of those who haveTrnt them here t'of an education. These
are not compliments lavished by vanity ; but truthsâ¢ extorted by
the jultice due your chara&ers as teachers.
' endcr mi "d to virtue, to science and ufefulnefs,
be of the firft conlcquence m society, what praise is due him, who,
With such impartiality, abilities and attention, prefidcs in this
large, and increasing Academy ?
Partijl as I am, Rev. Sir, to this mode ol education : warm as
my bosom glows with refpeft and gratitude for your paternal and
unhealing care for my improvements, I have not' risen to dtf.>iift
you wit.i a catalogue of commendations, of which, few of votir
cq uainta neeânone ot this society, can be ignorant. That refoeft
mi have taught me to entertain, for the , na |) virtuous and d-lerv
ing, 1 feel for you.âThe ufeful and moral precepts I have so of
ten received from you, I will endeavor to carry with me into the
woild, and hope I may be able to improve lipori them as I ad
vance in life. Whilst the finger of fcicnce, so evidently points to
this innocent sublime retreat for the education of our sex, may no
demon of discord be permitted to efiter these peaceful groves.
May the roots of this tree of knowledge of good only, you are di
recting our feeble sex to approach, be forever supported and en
riched by the unshaken foil of virtue* and its branches continually
encircled by the rainbow 6f refined and ufeful science.
io the late Director of this infant Academy, and h's amiable
lady, a tribute is due which I will not fully by attempting to de
scribe. âTheir places being so agreeably, and refpe&ably filled,
coes not leflen our love and elleem for them, or with us, eclrpfe a
ray of the purity with which their chara&ers forever shone. Had
nÂ»t an important demand in the church called them to a more ele
vated situation, pleasing would it have been to this Academy could
they have continued a charge,for which nature and education had
o happily formed them. The winds, on whose wings our fobs
w ere wafted to Letitz, and the Lehigh with whose waters our tears
were mingled, can witnefsto the grief and relu&ance with which
we bade them the last adieu. Their friendly images arc too deep
ly engraved upon the tablet of our hearts for time to erase.âMay
the gentle breath of peace foreverattend them !
I have now amved at the mod diftrefling scene, circumstances
have ever forced me to endure. â: -*
Ihe curtain of Reparation is now drawing .. .... ..i. ~
I nuvft bid you a long perhaps some of you it will
be an eternal adieu.- May our feparattng not break or weak-
but extend and ftrengtben the cords of love and friendfhip
with which we have hefebcAi bound. Toyouvown breasts,

OTHAT no Virgin woQldincline an ear
To wild profeilions from incenftant youth,
But nobly fcoin a sentiment to hear,
That fcems to laugh at innocence and truth.
For if no just difplcafure fiie reveals,
Time will convince her dearly to her cost,
That step by step the sweet delusion steals,
Till fame and honor are forever loft.
The female mind may bid its terrors cease,
Who never made her fofter feelings known,
Nor fear a thought deftruftive to her peace,
While prudence tells her to conceal her own.
But if, alas ! In some unguarded hour,
Erom this advice (he madly lhould depart,
She gives her lover an unbounded pow'r
To wound her honor and to break her heart.
In vain the fair to such a crifis,drove,
Iri sense or foul superior will confide ;
For when hasreafon triumph'd over love,
Or inclination been fubdu'd by piide?

BOSTON, August ii.
the -COLUMBIA.
It is with real pleafuue we announce, the fafe
arrival, in this port, on Monday lad, of the Ship
Columbia, Capt. Gray, from a voyagje of adven
sure to the North Weft Coaftof America.
I his Ship, in"tompany with the Sloop Wafll
ington, failed 011 the 30th September, 1787, and
the year following reached their place of deltina
uon from whence the Columbia failed with
urs , which Ilie disposed of in China, on her re
turn home.
To Meflrs: Barrel], Brown, Bulfinch, Hatch,
and rintard, who planned the voyage, their coun
try in indebted, for this experiment in a branch
of commerce before uneflayed by Americans :
And to their care in providing every necetlary
for the comfort and convenience of the crews,
may, under Heaven, be attributed the extraordi
nary degree of health which they have enjoyed ;
having loss but one man, by sickness, since they
failed.
_ Their country is also tinder obligation to the
intrepid Navigators who have conducted this
voyageâwhose urbanity and civility have secu
red the friendfliipofthe aboriginals of the coun
try they visited ; and whose honor and intrepi
dity have commanded the protection and refpedl
of the European Lordr of the foil, to the American
t ' lat another nation hath been for
bidden to be unfurled on the coast.
The Columbia and Wafliington are the firft A
merican vessels who have circumnavigated the
globeâand the Washington, which is only of 90
tons burthern, is the firft Sloop of any nation e
ver sent on so great a voyage.
On the Columbia's arriving opposite the Cas
tle, (he saluted the flag of the United States
with 13 guns ; which was immediately returned
therefromâand on coming to her moorings in
the harbour fired a federal saluteâwhich a great
concourse of citizens aflembled on the several
yvharfs, returned with three huzzas, and a liear
iy welcome.
We are told, that one of the natives of the
Island of Ovvhyhee, arrived in the Columbia.
NEW-HAVEN, August \ I
On the 10th of last month, about four o'clock in the afternoon,
(the wind blowing frefh, and the weather being thick and foggy)
the (loop Friendfliip of this por*t, John Ward, matter, ran on a
reef of rocks, near St Peters, a little to the westward of New
foundland, and was loft with her cargo of pine lumber ; by which
unfortunate accident, Mr. Richard Tritton, owner and fupcrcargo
of the velTcl, was drowned ; the reft of the company got on the
rocks, where they remained about 24 hours, (without any suste
nance) when they were taken off by some people from the shore,
who treated them with great uukindnefs, refuting to let them have
any of the articles driven on Ihorc from the wreck ; âand after
fluttering a variety of hardftiips they got to St. Peters, where they
took pailage in a vcflel bound to New-York, which landed the
mate and people, at one of the points of our harbour, last Sunday,
butCapt. Ware proceeded in the vessel t/> New-York.
Mr. Tritton, was a native of Halifax, about 40 years of age, has
resided several years m this city, and has left a widow and two
children. ââââ
PETERSBURG, August j
On Saturday lafl, the Sheriffs of the different
counties in this Diftri<ft, met at Brunfwick Court
house, and after comparing the polls, returned
William B. Giles, as duly eledted a Representa
tive to Congress, in the room of the late Theodoric
Bland.
N E W-Y O R K, August 18.
Government is formed in order to promote the general good,
j and that government is best which tends most directly to that end.
1 The best security against the abufQof the powers of government,
i. knowledge.âlt is indeed highly probable that a bad govern
| ment will extinguish knowledge among the people, or that know
t ledge will reform a bad government. But tho an enlightened
people would certainly attempt the reform, they would risk and
fuffer much in the undertakingâEven fucccfs has its dangers â
for in the period of fermentation of men's minds, the love of no
velty would conftautly demand, and an acute ingenuity would
' supply an infinity ofucw (chemes, which would prove pernicious
âEfety one would be an innovation, and every innovation in
â  some degree unlettles the ftne of security which men form focie
; ties to enjoyâThis uncertain state is dangerous to liberty.â-A
wife people therefore who enjoy liberty* have much at hazard,
when they listen to those who advise to weaken their government.
But when the government is derived from the people, it (hould
be considered as tha fafe>-guard of liberty. Instead of abftraft
/ 'pinions, let us appeal to fads which we all, remember, and most
of us with pain âIn 1786, the government of the Union was no
'lore than a lhadowâdrms were taken up in the eastern part of
ie Unired States. Wjs liberty more fecurethan at this period ?
Those who tall ihemftTves champions for liberty, and who exhort
â 11s to take away part of the powers of the National Government,
â¢ I "> as to brine if nearly to the admired standard of the confederati
on, will deliberate whether the) are not doing all in their 'power
a. ainft our liberties. This is the government of the peopleâby
educing its powers thev would diminish their own. They can
only ast as a body by means of' a government. When govern
ment is difTolvcd, every cnan being reduced to ast as an individu-
I, becomes nothingâThe Deople have always been cheated by
he tale that they arc to get the power which government losesâ
wheieas, their ambitious leaders exercifc it, and the people have
| onimonJy loft much of what thev had before.

NEW-YORK, AUGUST 18
Last Thursday evening the St. Andrew's Society of the State o
Vew-York held their quarterly meeting at the City-Tavern. The
society, anxious of shewing their refpeel to the c laratler of Col.
M'Gilli vray, availed ti emfelves of his pretence in this city,
and unanimously' eleÂ£ltd % him an honorary m. iriber of the society,
and immediately after a committee was appointed to cortdutfc him
to it. The Colpne) was introduced to the presiding officers m
their places, and received the compliments qf the fpciety. When
the bufipefs of the society was finiih d, he partook of a collation
provided for the occcafion, and mingled with great affability in
the feftivity of the evening. An opcafional song was prepared
and sung by a vifyiog friend, and addrrffed to the Chief in term*
so artless, and yet so affe&ing, as touched the hearts of the mem
bers with sensations uncommonly pleasurable.
The society were honored with the company of tlUfc" Hon.
Samuel Jqhnst<?n, Senator of the United States from North-
Caralma, who had previouHy been elc&eid an honorary member
by a meeting of the society specially called for that purpose.
On Saturday last The President of the Uni
ted StatesâHis Excellency GoV. ClintonâThe
Secretary of StateâHon. Judge BlairâColonel
Humphreys, Major Jackson, and Mr. Nelson,
embarked on board the Hancock Packet, Capt.
Brown, on a tour to Rhode lfland.
Extra ft of a letter from Bojlon, Augufl 2.
" This day the ship Columbia arrived hereâ the
particulars of her voyage you will ffee in the pa
pers.âThis mercantile enterprize does hono\ to
the concerned.âThere is no attempt too ardu
ous for the adventurous spirit of Americans
The sons of Columbia traverse the globe by
sea and land ; and nothing bounds them but the
limits of creation. To what eminence mull such
a people attain under the fofteringcare of a wife,
just and energetic government ; but the misfor
tune ol the world is, that there is scarcely oni
good government in it. You will perceive by some
late publications, that violent suspicions are
entertained that a want of redlittide and real pa
triotifui have stained some recent transactions in
ours, while in its infancy. Should these things
be true, the felfifh, unprincipled, avaricious
wretches will find that excrations will follow
them as their shadow, so long as anyone remains
to utter cursesâbut for the honor of human na
ture, and of our country, I hope better things."
The lottery mania appears to rage with uncom
mon violence. It is said there are nearly twen
ty lotteries now 011 foot in different States. The
faleof tickets has been uncommonly rapid. Lot
teries have been formed, published, the ticket!
fold, and drawn in the Courle of 10 or rj days.
The rage for adventuring however begins to a
bate, and it now takes months to comple.nt, what
has been tranfadied in a few days. Odd numbers
have been so very fortunate, especially if fold to
a very poor man, who borrowed the money, or
parted with his coat to procure the ticket, that it
is recommended to the fabricators of lotteries in
future, to designate every ticket by such number
Â°nlyâthe sale would be immensely expedited by
the meafore. So exceedingly fti ong was the
faith of a certain person in odd numbers, that he
purchased every ticket in a late lottery, whose
number contained three threes. He however
paid his full fhai e of the dedutfiion for the bene
fit of the lottery ; but he imputed his misfortune
to an extraordinary run of good luck which at
tended the intervening odd numbers.
There are some advantages which result from
lotteries: A person for 6 weeks drank one dram
less every morning, in order to save money
enough to buy part ot a ticket.
The Adl for the relief of Adam Caldwell, title
of which was published in our last, did not pass

CONGRESS.
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
FRIDAY, July 23.
Dei ate oh the amendment of the Senate to the Fund
ing Bill, to ajfumt * fart of the State Debts.
MR. Smith (S. C.)after some introJuftory observations, fafd,
thai lw<> points were generally conccdcd; namely that
the debts, which, for diilin&ion.faUe, were called ttate debts, had
been incurred for the common welfare and general defence, and
that tWe debts ought tu be paid : The quelliou was by whom ?
Whether by the fcveral states or by the Union ?
There was one principle, he said, which (hould be attended to
in llie discussion of this great question : that was, that the citixens
of one ftatc ought not to pay a greater price for independence than
thole al anothfr, but (hat a citizen of Jlety-H+niplhirc, in propor
tioa to bis means, rtiould contribute at much towards the cxpen-
ces of the war as a citizen of Georgia.
premtfidg this principle as one which could not be lhaken, it
might fciye as a ilandard by which the arguments on both fides
ought to be tried. Should the States be left to pay their respec
tive debts, it was evident that the citizens of thofc States which
fuffered most from the iocurfioiu and depredations of the enemy
would pay a higher price for their liberties than the citfiens of o
thcr States, because the debt would be larger, and the means of
payment Smaller. The btuden would be therefore unequal, and
c\cry retufal to equalize it would be unjust Whether the citi- ;
aens of those St tes were viewed in the light of creditors of the ;
â public or not, the inequality would be apparent. If creditors,
thev would have a iefs chance of being paid than creditors of o
ther States ; the individual io South-Carolina'who spilt his blood,
iurnilhed supplies or lent his money to carry on the war, would
probably receive compensation at the rate of a shilling in the
pound, while the individual in Maryland, with Similar claims,
would receive his compensation at the rate of fifteen Shillings in
the pound ; and while the citizen who had casually received a
continental instead of a State certificate, would be fettled with at
the rate of twenty Shillings in the pound.
If the citizens of the Suffering States wefe viewed not as cre
ditors, but as individuals liable to such taxation as would be nc
cejfary to do justice to the creditor, the inequality was no less ob
vious. In one part ot the union the people would be crafted
with grievous taxes, in another the taxes would be trifling ; the
inequality indeed would exist in a compound ratio ; for, in pro
portion to the amount of taxes neceffarv for the payment of its
debt, would be the inability of the Suffering State to pay them ;
inaSinuch as a large debt would be an evidence of great exeit'om,
and consequently of great diflrefs ; it would therefore follow,
that in one State, either the creditor would lose his debt, or the
citizens groan under an enormous burden, while in another State
the creditor would have his debt well funded, and the citizens
smile Under an easy fvftem of taxation.
Under the old confederation, this inequality, although incom
patible with the true principles of the social compact, was, how
ever tolerable, because each State retained all its refourcÂ«t ; and
because there was no other conditional mode of equalizing the
burden among the States than by a Settlement of accounts. Under
the present so- mof government if will be intolerable ; because
the impost, which to the States most in debt was the inoft valua
ble Source of revenue, is relinquished to the union; and because
ConÂ»refshavc it io their power, by the Affutnption, to do away
all disproportion. This measure will thevclorc stand the ttftjif
the principle above premised ; for (he creditois of all the States
will be placed precisely on the fame footing, and the of
all the States will be equally taxed.
An obje&ioo, however, is much depended on, derived from a
supposed inequality, which will occur in the event of an AlTump
lion forae States, it is said, have, Since the pcace, discharged a
part of their debts by confideiable exertions, and it is not just
that their citizens ftiould now contribute to the discharge of the
debts of other States which have been remiss,
In order to give weight to this objection, great merit has been
afluracd bv the former, and much cenfuve infli&ed on the latter
who have been exultingly asked, whv tbey had not made similar
efforts. Such a qut (lion, Mr. Smith faid,he was inclined to com
pare to the conduA of a man in the vigor of health, and who had
never feeu the face of a Dottor, asking a Tick friend, still languid
under the deprcflion ps a Ccverc illucfs, why he did uot cat hearti-
Jy and take cxcrcifc as he dul ?
Each State, he prcfumcd, undertook at the clofc of the war,
such methods of extricating hi rfelf from her embarrassments as
â¢were within the Co.mpafs of her abilities. He did not ascribe
the payments some Slates had made to a greater degree of virtue
in tnem than in others ; nor could he suppose that the gentlemen
â who made this oSfcrvatiod, seriously thought that an individual
â was more meritorious because he was a citizen of one Stair, than
if be bad been a citiacn of another : or that an ideal boundary
line of a State could operate so wonderfully on the hitman mind
as to render the citizen on this fide active in the performaoce of
his political duties, and the citizen on the other fide ina&ive ?
That heinc on the north fide of the Potoymac or the Savannah, an
individual would have more or less inclination to contribute his
exertions for the public good, than if he were oit the touth Gde I
Unlef* they insisted on thel'e points, how could thry account for
these inequalities of which they complained ; to what causes could
they attribute the large debts of fojmc states, and the smaller debts
of others. The exertions of some members of the Union since the
peace, to difincumber themfclves of their burdens, and the fupjnc
nefs of others ? Could they be traced to any other caui'e than a
greater degree of fuffering during the war, on the one part, and a
Â£vea?er abundance of refourcrs ffnee the peace on the other. Those
ttates, which during the war were most invaded by the enemy,
were at the peace most exhauftcd ; and it was unreasonable to
demand gVeat exertions from them. In proportion to their ftrug-
efforts was their debt encrcafed : In t.ie fame proportion
was their ftrcngth exhauftcd, and their resources drainedâwhile
<ither iVates, more fortunate, (and he envied them not their good
fortune*) contracted less debt during the war, and were fully com
petent to.the discharge of that small debt at the peace.
He wifhtd all these circumstances of comparative merit had been
kept out of view, and that the qucftion had been considered on
its proper groundk of justice and policy ; but as they had been
contemplated by some members as r.cceffary materials in the irt
veftigaUon, without which a proper eftima.teof the true merits of
the qucftion could not be formed, heconiidcred it a duty he owed
to the state he represented, to take some notice ]of the arguments
which had been urced on that-head
Two poin/s had been dwelt onâThe large debts of some States,
and the feeble exertions they had made to discharge them. He
was happy he had it in his power to clear up in a few moments,
the doubts of every candid mind on both those points, as they
related to South-Carolina. With refpeft tothefirft, the size of
her debt might be accounted for, from the following circum
stances :âthat Ihe paid, fed, equipped and cloaihed the whole
Continental liueoi South-Carolina from its firlt raising to the id
January a p p of seven years ; that the defeuce Â«f the
wholeSsuthtrA trade fell chiefly on South-Carolina, as well as the
prote&ion of a considerable extent of sea coast, which cost an inÂ»-
menl'e sum for vessels of war, gallics, &c.âWhile Georgia and
Virginia had their gallics on continental establishment, South-Ca-
Tolina had to pay her ownâthat Charlcfton was three several
times attacked by th& BritiOi in 1776, 1779 1 7^ 0 '
which induced an enormous eXpence sot fortifications ; fiitkiag
: vessels to obflruft their paflage up thi rivers ; arming and calling
forth the militia ; purchasing horses, naval military stores ; that
[ at the time the Bi itilh arms attacked the State on the sea coast,
the savages and tories attacked it in the Weftâthat in addition to
all this, the State had assumed out ol the hands of its citizens char
ges against the United States, liquidated by their Commifiioners
amounting to mote than two millions of dollarsâthat while the
citizens of some States receiyed hard moaey, the citizens ot South-
Carolina were compelled to receive certificates for the fuppltcs
which were furnifhed to the Southern army ; and that the State
had moreover been at a vail expence in raising an 3 equipping fomc
regiments of horse, under the fanflion of General Greene.âThefc
were fomc of the caufcs of the large debt tfiat State had long
groaned under. He then adverted to the steps Ihehau taken since
the peace to discharge it. Much could not be expelled from peo
ple distressed as her citizens were ; many of whom owed consi
derable private debts to liritifh merchants at the breaking out of
the war, and had been bereft of almost the whole of the property
with which those debts were to be discharged. A Stats* which
for thefpace offix orfeveu years had been constantly struggling with |
the enemy j which had loft its crops for several successive years ; ,
whose towns had bean burut ; al! tlÂ»e furniture of its citizens de
stroyed ; depiived of upwards of 30,000 negroes; nearly one
1 half of its labourers ; the property ol the citizens torn from them
by Britilh plunderers, or by American impressments ; multitudes
of their citizens killed ; in so much that in the d; ft rid of Ninety-
Six alone, there were 1490 widows at the close of the warâcould
not becenfured with any propriety for having made (lender exer
tions to discharge her debt?. In 1784, Ihe attempted a funding
system, and had kept down the intercft-cver since, which alone,
considering licr situation, was a confiderablc exertion, as the an
nual interest amounted to upwards of 300,000 dollars : Â£be had
alfofunk upwards of 9 million and a half of the principal, and
would have done more had the crops been favorable ; but from
1783 to 1787, in consequence of the depopulation of labourers,
the bad state of the fields, and a fuccefiion ol bad seasons the plant
ers had annually made scarce half a 1 rop. He did not mention
these circumftanee* to make a parade of them, but for the purpose
of removing iinprciTions unlavorable to the citizens of that coun
ry which teemed to exist in the minds of some of the members.
