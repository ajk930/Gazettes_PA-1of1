" It is easter to know mankind in general than *-
9y one man in particular."
MY neighbor Sciomnis is thought by his ac
quaintance to have a very philosophic way
of thinking. I can never hear him converse
without k Lairing his talent*, and being enlight
ened by his information. It is remarked of him
that he has inade human nature the chief objeift
of his study. Nor do I conceive, it is paying
him too high a compliment to fay, that he can
analize all the springs and properties of the foul
â¢with as much (kill and propriety, as the ablest
artilt can define the machinery ot a watch. Yet
my good neighbor has always been unfortunate
in his moll intimate connections, and has fufler
*d innumerable vexations from the insincerity
Â»nd ficklenefs of his friends. Perhaps no man
has been more frequently deceived in his opinions
of individuals, or Smarted more leverely by list
ening Cp the impulses of credulity.
1 have had the curiofityto fearcliout thecaufe,
why a person so apparently sagacious, is often the
dupe of thoi'e, who are, in all refpecls, inferior to
himfelf. It isdifficulttoallignareafon,whyaman
"who discovers so much dilcerninewt, when speak
ing of" mankind in the aggregate, iliould in all
his perf'otisl concerns never rightly eltimate a
single character. A person of the inolt slender
abilities may easily palm himfelf upon Sciomnis
for a man of lolid underXandiug ; and the molt
barefaced knaves have gulled him out of his mo
ney, by such tricks ana evasions, as scarce re
quired ordinary precautionto guard againit. In
jhort, my learned friend is wife for every body
but himlelf. He can tell his acquaintance, witji
almost a prophetic spirit, how to eltimate charac
ters and jiieafu.-CS ; and teach them with a pecu
liar degree of certainty, .how to cfcape the vices
antLfoTlies j.hatare floatingin Jj?':>e -X â  But he
himfelf can fleer clear of none of thrm, IIÂ»
secrets are often brought to light through the
â weakness of some of his afl'ociares ; and his hopes
are as often blasted through the knavery of o
thers.
I find the myfteryin this whole affair lobe no
thing more than this, that my neighbdr has
strong paflions as well as a ltrong understanding.
His feelings are fÂ« irritable and vigorous that
his reason can never aflame its full sway in di
recting concerns of a personal nature. The im
t>ulfes of some paflion beguile him insensibly,
and foil that discernment which is confpicuoivs
on occasions where lie is totally dilinterefted.
His maxims and reflections bear the marks of a
comprehenlive genius ; while his life discovers a
repetition of imprudent arts, which have flowed
front a heart susceptible to the ffighteffc touch.
If he happens to be flattered he forgets at once
that flattery is an artifice used bydeltgning men,
and in the ardor of his vanity, commits himfelf
without reserve to the insinuations of the flat
terer. This looks very extraordinary, as he
frequently in the moments of reflection, expa
tiates to his friends on the danger of putting con
fidence in men of smooth insinuating manners.
But why do I descend to particulars in designat
ing; the chararter of Sciomnis. It is fuflicient
to fay, that although his knowledge of human
nature is very acute and extensive, yet he is so
much the Have of whatever passion is uppermost,
that he is betrayed into athonfand indiscretions,
and exposed to innumerable difappoiutinents.
He understands mankind in the aggregate ;
while the application of his knowledge to par
ticular cases is'erroneous and unfortunate.

which were as yet only in /ketches. The Queen
mother and the Guises proceeded in the fame
manner with all whom they feared : Strongly
determined to confuinmaie iheir designs, they
judged that they could not fucccedj hut by ar
ranging all the llrong places, as well as the
troops, the finances, and all the resources of the
state, under their own disposition ; so that the
inoft important affairs ihould pass through no
hands but their own, and tbafVr f their crea
tures. Neverthtleft, to fliow ih:i y -iey consulted
their interest less than the pnbllc good and their
own glory, they did not elevate to dignities, peo
pie without merit, and drawn fVom the dust,
for fear they should be thought to make crea
tures for themselves at any rate : out they con
ferred favors only on persons, v.-bo added ac
knowledged merit to confpicuotis bitih, and
above all, eflimable in the eyes ol the people for
integrity. This condufthad a doyble advantage,
the fir ft, that the people conimighly applauded
their choice, and their opponent! had no pre
tence to condemn it : the second, that confiding '
in persons of honor and fidelity, they were not
exposed to be deceived, nor to fui'pect their at
tachment, as it often happens to those who com
mit the execution of their designs to people of
bale extraction, or dishonored by their manners,
in this view, they restored to office. Francis Oli
vier,formerly chancellor of the kiijgdom, a per
(onage of known integi ity and inflexible firmnefs,
n the exercise of his employment. The vigor
.vith which he avowed and fuppoyted his fenii
nents, had caused his difmilhon from couvi, from
he beginning of the reign of Henry lid. and the
nitigations of the Conflable had not a little con
ributed to his disgrace. They recalled also to
ouncU, and near the peifon of the King, the
ardinal de Tonrnon, who, in the time of r ran
is 111. grand father of the reiguing Prince,had
he principal condu<st of affairs. By these nich
'ures they flattered the multitude, and fulfilled
lie f*Â«ie dons of the public, â¢ hout negledt-
ing their own interests
The Â«robity of the Cardinal and of the Chan
cellor, had rendered them dear to the people,
who knew how often they had declared them
selves agalnft the multiplication of imports,with
which they were oppreiled. Moreover, disgrac
ed by the intrigues of the Conflable, and recall
ed With honftr by the Guises, they must, both
from resentment and gratitude, support with
their cbunfels, and all their influence, the pro
je<fts ot aggrandizement, formed by the latter.
Many others had been gained by similar artifices :
but the fame management was not used with the
house of Bourbon, nor with the family of the
Conltable. On the contrary, the Princes ofLor
rain, drawn away by thÂ« desire of annihilating
the credit of their ancient rival, and of abasing
the royal family, seized with ardor, every occasi
on of diminishing the authority and increasing
thelolles of their enemies.

that all our political evils solely originate from tumult, inrurrca

" NEVER have circumstances so urgent requi
red all Frenchmen to re-unite in one mind, to ral
ly themlelves with courage in support of the law,
and to favor with all their might the eftabliih
ment of the Conllitution. We have negle<fted
nothing in order to inspire every citizen with
thele sentiments. We have ourselves given them
an example of our entire and unequivocal confi
dence in the reprerentativesof the nation, and of
our constant difpolition to promote every measure
that might contribute to the happiness of our fub

" Can it then be polfible that the enemies of
the public welfare ihould still endeavour to inter
[ rupt the important labors which occupy the Na

rights of the people, and prepare for their hap
pinefs ! That they endeavor to stir up the public
mind either by vain terrors and falfe interpreta
ons of the decrees of the National Aflembly ac
cepted or famfiioned by us ; or try to raise doubts
as to our intentions, asill-founded as they are in
jurious ; and cloaking their private paflions or
interests under the sacred name of religion ?
" An oppoOtion so culpable would sensibly af
fect us at the fame time that it would excite our
utmost indignation. The continual objecfl of
our cares is to prevent and repress all of such a
nature. We have also judged it worthy of our
paternal solicitude, to prohibit even the signs that
might manifeft divisions and parties.
" Moved by thele considerations, and inform
ed that in different parts of the kingdom, indivi
dualshave taken the liberty to wear cockades dif
ferent from the National one, which we ourfelve*
wear ; and reflecting on the inconveniences that
may result from this diverflty, we have thonghc
fit to prohibit them.
" In confeqoence, we forbid all our faithful
fubjefts throughout the whole extent of our
realm to wear any other than the National Cock

We exhort all good citizens to abstain in
their speeches, as well as ill their writings, from
every reproach or diftin&ion capable of exaspe

In the bill now before the Senate, making provision for the re

lars now in the Treasury of the United States, be applied to pur
chasing the public debt in the market, while the debt is under

to borrow Two Millions of dollars, to be applied to the fame pur

The propofuion for applying the surplus of one million to pur
chasing up the public debt at the market price, while that price
is at a discount, moll meet the apptobition of every friend to the
United Slates : And the pairiolic, independent policy which sug
gested the meafure,is one among many other evidences of that ever
wakeful vigilance which marks the operations of thcTieafury de
partment.
FROM CORRESPONDENTS.
CONGRESS is accused of delaying thÂ£ public business. Fear
generates and hatred. Thotc who feared that it would not
be done at all, or done in a manner that would displease them
more than being neglected intirely, have futfered great anxiety.
The great objects of the feflion have called up the pillions of dif
ferent classes of citizen*. Nothing could be more opposite than
their views, and vet all seem to have agreed in giving vent to their
paflions by accusing Congress. It is time, now the great business
is finifhcd, to re-examine the charge.
All public bodies, whose duty it is to deliberate, will move
flow, and every nation has more to-sear from portion and enthu
fufrn hurrying their representatives into errors, than from over
caution which will waste only time. Alk of a party-man why
has Congress been so long occupied in funding the debt. Perhaps
he will fay, because the State debts were crowded in. Aik ano
ther, he will fay, because opposition was made to afluming the
State debts. A moderate man of no party will answer, that busi
ness was delayed, because the members could not agree how it
(hould be done. If the advocates for the State debts would have
joined the opponents of the measure, they niight have finiftied the
whole in a week. The like would have happened if all the mem
bers had agreed to the aflumption. But did the members use
more argument for and against the measure, and did they perse
vere in the support ot their refpeftive opinions with more zeal
and industry than the different classes of the citizens defircd, and
had a just right to require of them ? The public has been divi
ded as well and perhaps as much as the members. Each man
feemsto have become angry because others who opposed his opi
nions would not yield, and not because his per le
vered in trying to persuade him to do it. He would have been
more difplcafed had he found no support, or a faint one given in
Congress to the great meafurcs which have called up all his patri
otism. The feflion has not been a period of leisure. As the great
fubjetls of contention are now fettled, and a foundation is laid for
union, energy,and public credit, there will be less reason lor de
lay in future. We are just beginning to aÂ£l as a nation. Business
will soon wear itfelf a channel, and flow as fact as it ought.
The business of Congress has been in the highest degree difficult.
The entire business of a diftrefling war has been to fettle. A great
debt, existing in various intricate forms, has been new modified,
and the terms of a new loan agreed upon. Extensive funds have
been provided. The public anxiety has proved the difficulty and
importance of this part of their labor. Provision has been made
for fettling the accounts between the United States and the indi
vidual States. It was forefeen that this would prove an embar
rassing fubjeft, and those who know how much jealousy was en
tertained on this account, and how many well-informed persons
have despaired of its being done at all, will wonder that it has
been accomplished. Tho Congrcfs is charged with foftering fac
tion ; the progress and success of this great operation is evidence
that the spirit of conciliation is note, absolutely banilhcd from the
Federal Hall. The controversies about the State debts, the Qua
ker Memorial, and the feat of government have been carried on
with acrimony. However, it is in the highest degree pleasing to
fee the appearance of harmony, which seems to have returned at
the end of the lcflion. Many apprehended that it would never
return. Perhaps business never proceeded in Congress more
smoothly than it has of late. Altho the very difficult affairs of
this feflion, the moil important in the civil hiftor) of the Union,
have not been tranfaÂ£led in the time, nor in the manner many ear
neilly dcfired, it is to be hoped that the public apprehensions and
jealousies will subside, and that all good men will cultivate that
national spirit which diffufed such a lustre over the firft feflion.
This country wants nothing but a wife and energetic administra
tion of its government, to become the happiest in the world. But
the happiness wc have just cause to expect as a people, will be
hastened in its progress and encreafed in degree by chenlhing that
love for the Union, and that mutual good will which made us a
nation. Those who are industrious to Â£ow discord ought to be
discountenanced.
A free people will often complain, because it is a part of the
government, and because a free people will soon become enlight
ened, and fee the errors ofmeafurcs. But tl)ofe ate deceived who
suppose that these complaints discover a dislike to government.
If our citizens had not expected much from Congrels, and felt a
sincere regard for the Union, they would not have (hewn such
impatience under the delay of their wilhes. We cease to be a
people if we relax the bandsof union.

Extrat: of a letter fro a gt;;ticma>i in CharUjiofy
(S. C.) to the Editor, July 24, I 79Â°-
" I was much pleased on the whole with the
observations 011 the Englifli letter in your paper ;
but I cannot fay the pleasure was heightened by
the reflection thrown out against the foiitheru
States. Tis true it would appear from the con
duct of their representatives, [which, I think
will not tend much to increal'e their popularity]
that South Carolina and Georgia are violently
opposed to reltritftions on foreign navigation ;
but I believe, from the little inform., ion I have
been able to gain, that the contrary is the cafe,
particularly in this state, except amongst a few
British merchants, who, though they enjoy all
the privileges of American citizens, make it a
point to injure our trade as much as polfible.â
Every peri'on must know it is the interest of the
inhabitants at the prcfent moment to export their
produce in Britilh bottomsâ.but they look for
wardâthey are not so iniferly Ihort-lighted, as
to lock up the penny to-day, which might pro
duce them a/hilling by to-morrow.
" I think a writer who wishes to make the pub
lic wiser and better by his speculations, ought
to be careful how he publishes any thing which
may tend to keep alive vulgar local prejudices.
It was the layingafide these prejudices that made
us a nationâit was the revival of these prejudic
es that brought us to the brink of political ruin
âit was the smothering of these prejudices again,
that gave us a government.âAnd, happy lhall
we be, if their re-animation does not bring us,
not only to the precipice of ruin, but plunge us
down, to rife no more."

IJ the National Aflembly Ihould remain neuter, Spain will proba.

In (hort there is no end to conjc&urei, probabilities, uncertain

S 1 R,
PERMIT us in the name of the Society whom
we represent, to concur in the numerous con
gratulations which have been offered to you since
your accefiion to the government of the United
States.
For an account of our principles we beg leave
to refer you to the pamphlet, which we have now
the honor ti> put into your hands. In this pub
lication it will appear, that the peculiar dodtrine
which we hold, is Â»ot less friendly to the order
and happiness of society, than it is eflential to the
perfe&ions of the Deity.
It is a Angular circumstance in the liiftory of
thisdo&rine, that it has been preached and de
fended in every age, since the firft promulgation
of the eofpel, but we represent the firft society
profefling this doiflkine, that have formed them
selves into an independent church. Posterity
will hardly fail of connecting this memorable
event, with the auspicious years of peace, liberty
and free inquiry in the United States, whichdif
tinguifhed the adrniniftration o(General Wajking
ton.
We join thus publicly with our afifecftionate
fellow-citizens in thanks to Almighty God for
the -laji of his numerous signal atftt of goodness
to our country in preserving your valuable life in
a late dangerous indisposition, and we affureyou
Sir, that duty will not prompt us n>ore than af
fe<flion to pray, that you may long continue the
support and ornament of our country, and that
you may hereafter fill a higher flation, and enjoy
the greater reward of being a King and Priett to
our God.
Signed in behalf and by order of the Convention,
To the CONVENTION of the UNIVERSAL
CHURCH, lately assembled at Philadelphia.
Gentlemen,
I THANK you cordially for the congratulations
which you offer on my appointment to the of
fice I have the honor to hold in the government
of the United States.
It gives me the most sensible pleasure to find,
that,in our nation, however different are the fen
timentsof the citizens on religious dodirines,they
generally concur in one thing: For their politi
cal profeflionsand practices arealmoft universal
ly friendly to the order and happiness of ourci
â¢vil institutions. lam also happy in finding this
disposition particularly evinced by your Society,
It is moreover my earned desire, that all the
members of every association or community,
throughout the United States, may make such
"use of the auspicious years of peace, liberty, and
free inquiry, with which they are now favored,
as they lhall hereafter find occasion to rejoice for
having done.âWith great fatisfaftion, I em
brace this opportunity to express my acknow
ledgments for theintereft my affe<flionate fellow
citizens have taken in my recovery from a late
dangerous indisposition and I allure you gentle
men, that in mentioning my obligations for the
efFufions of your benevolent wiflies on my behalf,
I feel animated with new zeal, that my conduct
may ever be worthy of yonr favorable opinion,
as well as such as shall, in every refpeil, belt
cbmport with the character of an intelligent and
accountable being. G. WASHINGTON.
