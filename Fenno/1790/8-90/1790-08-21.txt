IT was fo'refeen, however, that the success
would not be happy. The King of Navarre,
intimidated by.the difficulty of lie enterprize,
,i<!ted with a delicacy, ir<-efolution and complai
sance, dictated by tliat foftnefs and moderation
whicji formed the eilence ofhis character. The
GuLfes, ou the contrary, full of that confidence,
which profpsrity inspires, prepared to repell
with vigor the attempt that was made against
them. In conceft with the Queen, they repeat
ed incefl'antly Jo the young Monarch, that his
predecefl'ors had always mortified the Princes of
the bloody as ertemies' to the reigning branch,
against which never ceased to operate,
foinetimesby secret cabals, and sometimes by
open force That in the prelent circumstances,
the King of Navarre and the Prince de Cond=,
feeing ttiemfelves To near the throne, under a
King of a ten<lef complexion, who had 110 chil
dren, and whose brothers were underage, fought
ojily to deprive liini of the support ofhis mother,-
and his nearcft fflatior.s, thatt'-py might govern
him at pleafur , and hold him 1.1 dependance, as
the Maires of the Palace had formerly held the
Clovis's, the Chilperics, and other Princes inca
pable of reigning. That perhaps there was no
crime at which they would heiitate, even to em
ploying poison, or the sword, to open a paflage
for themselves to the throne. The King, natu
rally timid and suspicious, pre occupied by these
artificial accusations, wbirh were coloured with
some appearance of probability, saw with an evil
eye, the King of Navarre, andrcceived him cold
ly. In the audiences which he granted him, al
ways in the presence of the Duke and the Cardi
nal, who never quitted him a m&iiient, he gave
luri no ir but dry answer" ; that lie
was of age ; that he was not refponlible to any
man for his actions ; that he was fatisfied with
the good services of thofc who governed under
him ; and rejected conltantly all the requells
and demands of the Princes of the blood, as irre
gular, unreasonable, and made with ill dcligns.
The efforts of the King of Navarre had no bet
ter success with the Queen -piother. â¢ She knew
that she could not depend upon the attachment
which the Princes of the blood profeffed to her ;
lhat as soon as they (hiuld obtain what they so
licited, they would exclude her from the govern
ment, and foi'ce her perhaps to quit the Court.
She judged moreover, thacit would be imprudent
to abandon the party the molt powerful and the
best eftabllflied, to attach herfelf to the Pvinces
of the blood, who had 110 certain support. She
determined therefore to pursue her firft, plan :
but as (he wiihed to prevent the horrors of a civil
war, (he proposed to herfelf, not entirely to take
away all hopes from tbe Princes, but to make
use of artifice and dillimulation, to divert the
King of Navarre, whose docility (he knew, from
thedefigns which he had formed, and to wait,
from time and conjunctures, some expedient, ad
vantageous to the welfare of the (late. In con
sequence, Ihe received him with great demon
ibrations of friendfhip, and amused him with the
faired hopes. li> the course of conversations
which they had together, (he insinuated, that the
pailions of the King were easily irritable i that
hemuftnotbe vexed with demands and com
plaints out of season ; that it was neceftary to
wait for opportunities more favorable ; that the
Xing having palled his fourteenth year, might
govern by hinifelf, and without taking counsel
â¢of any one ; that when he (hould find an oppor
tunity to 111 anifell his benevolence for the Princes
of Bourbon, lis would fulfil all that was required
of him, by the relations of blood, and would
prove to all the world the esteem and consider
ation, which he entertained of their merit and
fidelity : that to change, all at once, in the be
ginning ofa reign, the older established in the
government, would be to gi v e ilie King among
his own fubjec r ts,' the reputation of an incon
stant .Prince, without prudence and without
ftrnincfs : that if atiy employment worthy of
them ihould be vacant, he would have a regard
to the judice of their pretensions : that in her
own particular, (he offered lierfelf voluntarily
to manage their interests with lief (on, to engage
him to grant them, as soon as (hould be po'lible,

the fatisfaiflion they desired : that it was not de
cent that the King of Navarre, who had always
evinced his wifdoniand moderation, Ihould now
fuffer himfelf to be guided by counsels, and
drawn into rash meafqres which were neither
consistent with- his age nor chara<fter ; bnt by
waiting with patience, for what depended whbl
ly 011 the benevolence and affection of the King,
he ought to teach other's, liO'V 50 merit in their
due seasons, the favor andbt: 'senceof his Ma
jesty. The Queen having sou ndrd at seve
ral times, by such general discourses, and per
ceiving that he began to waver, compleatly gain
ed him at length, bv faying that they mufl im
mediately fend into Spam, Elizabeth, the fitter of
the King, who must bft attended by some Prince,
distinguished by his reputation and by his rank ;
that (he had cdft Tier eyes on him, as the p'erfon
age the inoft proper to lupport the honor of the
nation, by the fpiendor of his virtues, and of the
Majesty Royal, with which he was adorned ; that
beltdes the fatisfadtion Which the King her son
would have in it, he would find a great advantage
for his private pretensions, by the facility which
he would have, of conciliating the affections of
the Catholic King, and at the fame time of treat

PHILOSOPHICAL REFLECTIONS
ON T Hl. LATE
REVOLUTION IN F R AN C E, ire.
CGKTIKUATION,
LORD STANHOPE., has thought proper to
pals an eulogy on the National Allenibly,
for making no dimndlion between Catholics and
Proteflains, but impartially admitting both to
all offices of tryit and profit ; and invidiously con
tra fits our conduct with their's, in refpetft to the
DifTirnters, Bnt if their true u.L ive be coDfider
ed, they will be found by 110 means entitled to
panegyric. By this affected moderation, this
specious candor, this cbinpreheniive indulgence,
they evidently exhibit a contemptuous indiffer
ehce foV the Catholic established church, and the
solemn decisions of councils and theologifts.â
This is a dangerous unequivocal fyinptom of their
maladyâa prognostic and a diagtioftic of Athe
ism.
On the fame consistency of principle, Mr. Mi
rabeau moved this senate of democrat/ to address
the king to appoint an envoy foi- thefpecial pur
pose of jointly consulting with our adminiftra
tio'n on the most effectual means of abolilhing the
slave trade. Did this spring from the generous
suggestions of humanity ? Certainly not.
Treachery marks their proceedings ; and the
ruin of revealed religion is the invariable aim of
all their adiions. For has it not been incontefti
bly proved, by writers equally distinguished by
genius, learning, and profound researches into
antiquitv, that the eldest born of Ham, who was
accnrfedby his father, was called Cufh, " which,
in the Hebrew language, fignifies black. Ethi
opia, under which name Africa is included, is
called in scripture the land of Cufh, and the in
habitants, Cnfhims, or Cufhites. The negroes
therefore are descended from Ham, by his eldest
Ton, Cufh ; which accounts for the degraded si
tuation these people have ever continued in."â
This reafoningis conclusive.âThe Cufhites were
certainly devoted to perpetual llavery, for the
wickedness of their great progenitor, Ham.â
Cufh himfelf was probably born black, both as a
prophetic designation of his future fate, and to
transmit this degenerate color to his posterity.
The only specious objection to this very ra
tional liypothefis, is obviated by the author of
Obfirvations, &c. in anfvver to Mr. Clarkfon's re
probated Eflay. " It may be objected," fays he,
" that Cufh was born prior to the time of Ham's
committing the offence against his father, for
which he sentenced him and his posterity to so
severe a punifhment âand therefore rhe complex
ion of Cufh cauld not have any relation to the
crime to be committed afterwards by his father.
In answer to this, I obfer*e, there is no impro
priety, nor improbability, in supposing that the
blackness of Cufh was the mark fct upon him and
his posterity, from the forknowledge of the Dei
ty, of the crime, and consequent punishment,
which Ham would commit, and be sentenced to ;
and as a seal of thaf: perpetual servitude to which
565
his defcendents were to be doomed by that feii
tence.
Be this as it may, it is inconteftibly proved by
the celebrated author of ylndent ftlythoiogy, and
universally admitted, that the Europeans are the
foils of Japlieth : It is therefore our indispensa
ble duty to accomplish the divine prediiftions of
Noah, and to hold Ham's defendants in chains
foicver. Butitisthe avowed intention of the
National Afleinbly to weaken the credibility of
the sacred hiltory, by emancipaiing the negroes;
However, I trull we fliall not be made the dupes
of this profane policy : On the contrary, I sin
cerely wifli, that the corporations of Briltol and
Liverpool would fend out the reverend author of
the Scriptural Refmrchetto the Well-Indies, witk
a cargo of bibles ; which may be conveniently
(lowed in the llave-ftiips, as they are not now fÂ»
much crowdcd as formerly. Let him teach tha
unfortunate Africans to read and study the book
of Genesis ; let their genealogy becondcnfed into
a short catechifin, suited to their untutored capa
cities, and taught them every Sunday by one of
the negro-drivers.âlt is impoflible to lay what
a sudden and salutary effetft it may have on their
unenlightened minds, to k'r.ovj that their fnfler
ings are solely owing to the wickedness of their
ancellor, Ham.
It will conciliate their afFecftions, andendeartlie
sons of Japhetli to their hearts, if they are once
persuaded that we hold them- in bondage, and
inflict (tripes on them, neither to obtain any b:vf#
and fordid profit from their burning toils, nor to
gratify the sudden iuipulfe of vindictive pallion,
but merely in obedience to the decrees of Heaven,
to accomplish the word of prophecy, as faithful
executors to the lad will and teltament os- Noah,
our common progenitor, the second father of
mankind.
Monf. Volney, indeed, would fain persuade us,
on the authority of" Herodotus, that the Egyp
tians, celebrated both in profane and sacred his
tory, were blacksâand thence artfully insinuates
that we do not absolutely derive our intellectual
superiority over them from" the whiteness of our
fkius. But, even on this hypothelis, though the
Egyptians mighc have been of a dark color, yet
they were not of fodeep a dye as the defendants
of Cufh, nor was their hair so foft and woolly ;
which makes an eflential difference between tliem.
Besides, it has been conjectured by the AbbeSpa
lanzani, and demonltrated by a late di(fe<ftion at
Jamaica, that the cellular membrane, on which
the color of the epidermis or outer cuticle depends
is wondroufly extended overthe brain of the ne
groes, and completely wraps up the cerebrum and
cerebellum in its curious net-work. Gonfequent
ly, the impreflion made by external "objects on
the fenforium is rendered less distinct by palling
through this reticular envelope, the nervous sen
sibility thereby blunted, and the rational facul
ties weakened. By this aftoniihing contexture
of the reasoning organ, the polterity of Ham, and
the sons of Japhetli, are fpecifically diltinguilhed
from each other. The former cannot feel foex
quilitely as the latter, either intellectually or sen
sitively ; and yet, by this admirable contrivance f
they are graciously fitted for that Hate of degra
dation and slavery, to which they are perpetually
devoted.
It will give me great pleasure if this Angular
discovery fliould afford the least iatisfadtion to
those whose generous, but mis-applied sympathy
has carried them beyond all bounds of prudence
and discretion on the fnbje<3; of the slave-trade.-â
They may now reft allured that the negroes do
not iuffer more than they can bear. The dulliiefs
of their understandings, and the bluntnefs of
their sensations, (originating from the fame
cause) alleviate their transient miseries, and pro
tionably shield and protedl them from that pun
gency of mental and corporeal pain they would
otherwise feel from incidental acfts of severity,
to which a state of slavery must sometimes expose
them. This anatomical description of the prolon
fation and extension of the subcutaneous meni
rane over tlie brain, Ihould be explained to the
blacks, in familiar untechnical language by the
surgeon of the plantation, who always charitably
visits and attends them after every punishmentâ
as they are always humanely indulged with some
hours reft and relaxation,to repair their exhauit
ed strength and spirits. When they have once
attained a clear (cientific conception of this phe
nomenon from the furgeon,the clergyman fliould
theji explain the final cause of it to his catecbttn
[Whole No. 142.]menu, that they inay derive religious eonfolation
from this marked providential inferiority of their
species, and look up to their masters, miftrefles,
and the vigilant negro-drivers, with more awe
and reverence. To be continued.

ROYAL HUMANE SOCIETY.
On Tuesday the honorary medal of the royal
humane society was prelented to Mr. Edward
Coleman, Surgeon, St. Mary Axe, for the best
dillertation on suspended animation.âAn ad
dress suitable to the occasion was very ably deli
vered by Dr. Hawes ; and after thanks had been
â voted, a well conftrufted apparatus for applying
warmth, was laid before the society by a gentle
man from Manchester ; and a still more ingenious
one for promoting artificial respiration, by Mr.
Coleman.
NETHERLANDS.
The counter revolution that is threatened in
the Netherlands by the vigorous preparations of
the Auftrians, and the disunion of the ariltocra
tical and republican parties, occasions the less re
gret among all moderate men, that the states
aim plainly at the establishment of themselves in
to a number of petty sovereigns, or, as a Greek
or Roman would have said, of tyrants. Who,
â¢without indignation, can behold the trentment
of Vandermerlch, the saviour of his country, con
lined in the citadel of Antwerp What Iriend
of human nature but is anxions for his fafety ?
What reasonable man that contemplates his situ
ation, but mufl. acknowledge that the tyranny
ef aristocracy is equal to that of a single despot !
LAW INTELLIGENCE.
Yesterday was tried before Lord Loughboro'
and a special Jury, a cause in which a mercan
tile house was the Plaintiff, and Mr. Burton, an
underwriter, the Defendant. Tho adtion was
brought to recover a sum of money upon a policy
of insurance on the fliip Elizabeth.
The question in this cafe was, whether the as
fured had at the time the policy was effedled,
uiade a fair communication to the Defendant of
sil the circumstances relative to the Ihip.
TheCounfel on both fides admitted the law to
be, that if a fairreprefentation of all the circum
stances was withheld the policy was void.
It appeared in evidence, that the Broker em
ployed in this business made a verbal communi
cation'of the general circumstances, but did not
<hew the defendant l'everal material letter! re
fpeefting the time the Ihip was to let fail, and o
ther particulars. In one of those letters were
the following words :â" A total loss will be the
best market for us."âThese words left a Itrong
iinpreflion on the minds of the Juryagainft the
Plaintiffs.
Lord Loughborough observed, that thequefti
Â©n in this cause was certainly of importance to
mercantile men, engaged in this species of trade.
It was for the J ury to consider, whether, if all the
circumstances disclosed by the evidence had been
known, any person would have underwritten this
ship. His Lordship was of opinion, that an un
derwriter was not obliged by law to interrogate
a broker, or to demand the production of letters
relative to the lhip agreed to be underwritten,
but that the latter ought to make a fair reptefen
tation of all the circumstances.
The Jury found a verdkt for the defendant,
LAW RETORT.
Hale, an Attorney, againjl Ballard.
This a&ion was brought by the Plaintiff, to
recover 01. for work and labour done in his pro
feflxon, for the defendant. Mr. Ballard, as it ap
peared in evidence, was an illiterate man, and
employed the Plaintiff to sue a debtor for two
guineas. Mr. Hale proceeded in this a&ion in
the Courts at Weftininfter and got the two gui
neas, which he retained, in part payment of the
cods of that aAion ; and he thought fit to bring
the present action against Ballard, for 91. the
remaining part of the costs, so that the Plantiff
charged the Defendant ill. for recovering for
him 21. 2s.
The Counsel for the Defendant, justly repro
bated this condudl in severe terms. He said, he
Ihould do in this cafe what painters sometimes
did when they could not do jufticeto the fubjed:,
he fliould draw a veil over the whole tranfa&ion.
This Attorney, instead of proceeding in the
Courts of Westminster Hall, ought to have ad
vised Mr. Ballard to have reduced his demand so
as to have brought it within the jurifdicftion of
the Court ofÃequefts. If he had done this, it
would have been attended only with a trifling
expence.
Lord Kenyon exprefled a just indignation at the
condud; of the Plaintiff, and the Jury found a
verditft for the defendant. His. Lordship hoped,
that the Plaintiff and others in hisfituation would
lake care and be more circunifpect in their con
duifl for the future.

LORD Salisbury, with all refpett I beg,
As thjere's a vacant place.
Forward, to put my humble leg,
And pray your Lordship's grace,
Perhaps you think, as I've a post already,
That I've enough, my Lord, to make me ftcady.
That that's enough to stop my note,
And gain for Pitt a constant vote.
A little circumstance then let me mention,
To telJ, although T dread it,
Yet faith upon my credit,
I really in the City
Shall fall below all pity,
Unless, and quickly too, I yield my peKiion.
I own, in eloquence I'm no great hand,
And that there are many better fpcakers in the land ;
Indeed there are toÂ© many better within St. St ephe n's wall,
But none that for %. Minister can louder bawl.
Beside, did not />ltavUig my family all frantic,
Set fail upon t?Â»e nation's cause,
To restore Great Giorce's laws
Oncc more among the rebels over the Atlantic.
Another thing, too, permit me to remark.
Am I not known to fame,
Thy brulh, oh ! Copl ?y, keeps aliVe my name,
And (hews me struggling with a monft'rous shark.
I know, my Lord, your party would not lose me ;
For I've a reputation
All over this great nation,
Except indeed at College ;â
fNo, my unlearned pate
Ne'er saw a college gate,)
For deep commercial knowledge,
It might not then be prudent to tefuie me.
Mp dealings with many a foreign house
May prove a Jucky hit
To our good Minister Pitt ;
For I can hear how matters go
Abroad, with ev'ry friend and foe,
And out of news may correfpondenls chcufe.
'Tis true I ne'er employ'd my time
In learning how to rhyme,
So perhaps with Poets you'll quarrel,
It on me you bestow the Laurel.
Yet for a crown or at most a guinea,
I can get some tuneful Ninny,
Who has flighted great Plutus's bags,
To follow the Muses in rags,
To write mc an Ode I dare lay,
That will do just as well.

Extract from " Letters on Egypt."
<t"T SHALL conclude this letter, Sir, by a short
X tale, which will prove that incidents limilar
to those of the times of Jacob are still renewed
in Egypt. The plains of Syria lalt year were
ravaged by clouds of locusts, which devoured the
corn to the very root. A famine followed, and
a farmer near Damascus felt the effects of a ge
neral distress. To supply the wants of a nume
rous family, he fold his cattle ; which resource
being soon exhanfted, the unhappy father,
wretched at present, but forefeeing greater
wretchedness to come, prefled by hunger, fold
his instruments of hufbandiy at Damascus. Led
by the invisible hand of Providence, as former
ly Tobias was by the angel, while he bargained
for corn, lately arrived at Damietta, he heard
speak of the success of Mourad Bey, who had en
tered Grand Cairo victorious, and in triumph.
The shape, character, and origin, of the warrior
were described, and how he had risen from sla
very to power supreme. The astonished farmer
found the description accorded with a son, who
had been lUle from him at twelve years old :
hope palpitated in his heart ; he haflened home
with his provisions, told his family what he had
heard, and determined, immediately, to depart
for Egypt. His weeping wife and sons offered
up prayers for his fafe return. Going to the
port of Alexandretta he embarked there and
came to Damietta. One continued fear torment
ed him ; his son, forfaking the religion of his
fathers, had embraced Mahometanifm ; and now
surrounded as he was by splendor, would he ac
knowledge his parents > The thought lay heavy
on his heart ; yen, the wish to snatch his family
from all the horrors of famine, the hope of find
ing a long lamented foil, gave him fortitude.
He continued his journey, came to the capital
repaired to the palace of Mourad applied to the
officers of the prince, and, nioft ardently, foli
citecl admiflion. His dress and appearance be
spoke poverty and misfortune, and were poor
recommendationsâbut his great age, so refpeeffca
ble in the east, pleaded in his behalf. One ofthe
attendants went to the Bey, and told him an aged
man apparently miferable,requefted an audience.
Let him enter, replied Mouradâand the farmer
proceeded, with trembling steps, over the rich car
pet which bespread the hall of the Divan, and
approached the Bey, who reclined on a fofa, em
broidered with silk and gold. Crouding sensa
tions deprived him of the use of speechâ at last
after attentively looking, the voice of nature
vanquiilied fear, he fell, and embracing his knees
exclaimed, You art my son J The Bey Faifed him^

endeavored to recolleA, and, after explanation,
finding him to be his father, made him fit down
by his fide, and caressed him moil affectionately.
The firll gush of nature over, the Sire described
in what a deplorable ftatehehad left his mother,
and brethren, and the Prince proposed to fend
for, and with them divide his riches and power
if they would embrace Iflanifm. This the gener
ous christian had forefeen, and, fearing youth
might be dazzled, took not one of his sons with
him. He, therefore, firmly rejected Mourad't
offer, and even remonstrated with him on his own
change of religion. The Bey, finding his father
determined,and that his family's diltrefs demand
ed immediate succour, sent him back to Syria,
with a large sum of money, and a vessel loaded
with corn. The happy hulbandman immediate
ly returned to the plains of Damascus, where his
arrival banifhedmifery, and tears, from his home
ly roof, and brought joy, ease, and felicity."

A man games at cards to win monev for liimfelf
and family that is unlawful. Again, he games
at a tavern for money to be spent for the good of
the house, this is alio unlawful. Again, he <rames
*n a lottery to ease his neigbours of their taxes,
wins the poor walher woman's money, carries oi
! triumph, and leaves the poor womar
half diftratfted for her loss, yet this is lawful be
cause it is designed for the public good. Goody

If the newspapers speak true, our American
politicians have given a frelh proof of their fupe.
rior ingenuity, by the new balances they have
lately invented. Mr. Herfchell's new invented
elaflcs by which he has discovered planets nevet
before seen by mortal eyes, has done him great
nonor. And a coinmittee ofour politicians have
invented a curious pair of scales, by which politj.
cal justice is weighed with fucti exaftnefs as mufl
do them honor. By experiments already made
it appears, that if a man loaned government 111-
â¢ and gold, or supplied their armies with clo
thing and stores, 13 or 14 years ago, took theit
obligation promising payment ofthe principal of
it in two or three years, with intereftat 6 per cent,
and now the whole principal isyet unpaid, and
part of the interest, if the diftrefled creditor calls
for his money, I fay by this new discovery, it ap
pears to be doing justice, to give him a new note
-in lieu of the older one, for jds of ids of the prin
cipal, payable before the coming in of the Jews,
at 6 per cent, interest ; also, another note foi
part ofthe remainder without interest for ioyears
and another note for the remainder at 3 per cent
interest payable before the milleniuni. This is
that branch ofjuftice which has lain hiddrp ever
since the deluge, but now marvellously discover
ed by Americans. It is however to be lamented,
that these Pcales will not weigh the justice of any
thing but old state debts with any certainty ; o
therwise 1 should be glad to weigh the pay oft

payment of Â§ds of fds of 6 dollars a day woulc
not come as near to jultice with him, asto pay ofl

" It is ftncerely to be regretted that so much

The flocks created by the new loan will average a
profit of about four and an half per cent, which
is more than real estate produces, and which in a
shorter period of time probably than is generally
imagined, will be near the rate which money in

companied with trouble and risk."
MIDDLETOWN, August 14.
Much has been said of the diminution of the
population of the United States, to be dreaded
from migrations to the western country. This
apprehension is ill-founded. The increase of
people in these states by births is tjo,ooo annu
ally, being one twentieth part of the whole num
ber of the inhabitants ; v/hereas the migration to
the western country, as stated lately in Congress,
by the Hon. Mr. Brown, is only 15,000 annual
ly on an average.

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
FRIDAY, July 23.
f)ebate on the amendment of the Senate to the Fund
ing Bill, to affabie a part of the State Debts.
Mr. Smith. (S. C.) *
Concluded.
THE opposition to the alTumption was ftrongeflfrom the States
of Virginia and Maryland, and was founded in a belief that
those States would be coniiderably injured by it. It had been
said that they had cxtinguifhed a considerable portion of their
State debts, and had placed the balance in a convenient train of
fcttlcment : the'Scate of Virginia,including Kentucky,he faid,was
a very targe and opulent State, abounding in internal iefoiirces,and
the exertions the had made towards the discharge of her debt
ought ndt to be eftimated'by a eompaiifon with other States, but
by â¢ reference to her own lizc Â«ntd ftrcngth : exertions which
rn'fght appear considerable when put in opposition to those of
fmallerStates, would perhaps appear of less importance when
her magnitude and vail resources Werecontcmplated. The mem
bers from that State had not informed the hÂ«ufe of her
debt had been discharged, tlio* they had generally spoken of a
large fuin ; he had been informed that it did not in the whole
exceed three millions of dollars ; now this was surely a moderate
sum to be raised in a period of eight year* by a State which, ac
cording to a refpc&able author, might without inconvenience,
even in the time of war, raise 1,500,000 dollai* annually. 'But
South-Carolina, a State of not half the size and population, had
paid mote than three millions of her debt, although Ihc had un
qucflionably fullered much more by the war.
With refpett to the State of Maryland, notwithstanding Hie
had fortunately efcapcd the, ravaging hand of the enemy, yet ftie
was obliged to resort to her confiscated property as a fund tor the
discharge of her debt, while South-Carolina had, in pursuance of
ihe treaty of peace, and the recommendation of Congress, libe
rally relinquished a mass of valuable conftfcated property, with
which lhe might lftng ago have funk every farthing of her debt.
Upon iuveiligation it did not then appear,that those States were
entitled to more applause for their exertions, or would be more
injured by the assumption than other States ; but admitting, he
said, that their exertions have been confiderablc, they will ob
tain a credit for them in the final fettle men t, and will become
creditor States in proportion to their advances. The afluihptfon
will be favorable to both the. debtor and creditor States ; thefor
mer will be relieved from their debts, and will not be compelled
to pay their balances by dire& taxes which they otherwise niuft
do ; the latter can receive their balances by no other process ; af
ter the alTumption, th*re will be more creditor than debtor States,'
consequently there will be a majority in both houses to enforce a
â ftttlenient and payment. The advantages to the States in general
will be considerable; relieved from a grievous preflure of State
debt, and from an expensive mode of taxation, they will apply
their internal resources to the improvement of their manufa&ures,
the opening their inland navigation, and the encreafing of their
cxpotts.
The non-aflumprion will \>c produ&ive of endless embarrass
ments ; some States were unable to discharge their debts with the
aid of the impost and excise ; how will they be equal to it, de
prived of those resources, or having only a partial afliftance from
the latter ? If the Union (hould rtfort to the excise as well as the
impost, the States will have nothing left hut dire& taxation, and
can thev with that resource alone defray their civil lift and con
tingent annual expcnces, and fink their debts ? The States will be
compelled to carry on a warfare of revenue againll each other:
manufactures prote&ed bry duties in a manufacturing Sfate will
be crushed by a heavy excise in a consuming State; excise will
be la'id on import, and excise will be laid against excise, and the
people will be ground between the rival systems. One of the
principal causes of the present government was the mifchief re
fusing from a conrrariety of commercial regulations in the dif
ferent States ; the no'n-aflumption will renew ihcfe einbarruffments
âwill defeat one of the main obje&s of the constitution, and bef
repugnant to its very â principles ; the meeting at Annapolis had in
view a uniform system of commercial regulation* and duties and
from that meeting fpiungtHe prefcqt conftjtution. ThÂ£ rejection*
of this measure will induce a repetition Â« f a)L ihofe clashing iyf
tems whicto were so injurious to our"trade and manutaÂ£lures.
A-slhe assumption relates to the government of the United States,
there can be no doubt that viewing it as a federal question, it will
be a measure, which will contribute to the more durable union of
the States and will greatly facilitate the collection of the revenue.
It will lie just and politic : Jult, brraufc the*xpences were incur-â 
red in the common cause, and ought to belaid from the com
mon treasury ; and because Congress are ejtclulivelv poficir>_d of
the betV rtfources of the country ; politic, becaufc the State sys
tems nf revenue will obftrufi and injure the national system and
impai- the credit of the United StMcs. These conliderations
should have weight with those who arefpecially appointed to ad
minnler this government. â In < great national queliion they
%iuld not futfer local confideranons to warp their judgment and
influence a vote-on which perhaps the very exigence ot the union
may defend. Will it be denied that there -will be a clashing be
tween fche States on the fubjeft of taxes and exiifcs, that there will
be heart burnings on the part of the State creditors who will be
left destitute while ample provision ij made for the continental
creditors ; that many of them will not only connive at frauds in
iNe revenue, but will even promote tliem to-rcducethe continent
al creditor to a level with themlelvrs, that smuggling, infteod of
being viewed as a crime against the union, will be deemed an ui
tiocent aÂ£l, and even brcflme popular ; because those who think
abandoned by the government will feel themSclves juf
lificd iu thwarting the colleftiottof a revenue which is to be dis
tributed with so partial a hand ; shall one creditor be ruined be
caufc hp happened to be a citizen of a State, diltant from the re
fidcnce of Congress, and received State securities, while another,'
perhaps less meritorious (for he might not have been a voluntary,
creditor) will have the principal and interest of his debt well
funded, and a conformable subsistence provided for the remainder;
of his days? Shall the baie ciicumftance of a continental comj
miffioner not going into a diltant State till a considerable time af
ter the peace, to liquidate the claims of its' citizens, deprive them,
ef a coinpenfatipn for their services, or a retribution tor their
property employed in the common cause ? Or (ha'.i the (offerings!
of a State dining the war be aggravated as the peace, by saddling
her with the payment of a large debt incurred for general purpo-
Jes ? When thefc reflections rulH on the minds of the State cre
ditors, would it be surprising that they Ihould abhor a govern-,
merit b,y which they (hall be treated with futh palpable inj-iftice il
llut it is contended that jultice will be done them by leaving
the payment of their demands to the several States ? And that jus*
tice will be also done tq those States which have made greater ex
ertions than-ethers on a final I'ettlement of accounts. With res,
pett to' the latter STileWation, itYannot be urgrd with finTritv
by thyfc who haÂ«c d-Kared themftlve* purfuaded that, no fettle?
jiic.-it will cyct taKc pl.v>e, and who hive relied on that circum-t
(lance as an argu meÂ«t agairift the aflumption, bccaufe, fay they, it
is unjust that the States which have made considerable efforts linje
the peace to*difcharge their debts, should he taxed a second time
to contribute towards the debts of other States; when this ob
jection is obviated, by telling them that on a final settlement of
accounts, they will have credit for these payments, and that the
smaller the debt which is aflumed by the union, the larger will be
their balance as creditor States, they ridicule the idea ot any final
adjuflment of account* ; now when it is declared that theairuinp
tion isneceflary to do jufiice to those States which made the moil
confidcrable exertions to repel the enemy, we are referred, for
that juflice to a final fettlemcnt of accounts. ISut cither-there will
be a fettlcnient or there will not ; If there will be a feujement,
no injuflice will be done by the alTuinption to tWe States which
have already paid off a portion of their debts, for on such settle
ment thry will have credit for their payments with interest, and
will have iheir advances refunded : If there will not be a fcttle
ment, the argumeut in of the assumption is unanlwerable,
for it is the only mode by wl\ich jufticcÂ£*m be done to the States
which were moll expo fed to the attacks of the enemy, and made
the greatest advances in the common defence. But if there be uo
feitlement, I shall be alked how is retribution to be made to the
States which have cancelled part of their debts finee the war ; wall
not the a (Turn pt ion be jqjurioua.to them ? I aufwer in a confiier
ably smaller degree titan the non-alfumptioii to the others ; because
their ability to discharge part of their debt finer the peace is a
strong proof that they fuffcained little injury by the war ; and al
though they (hould coutnbute to ths discharge of the deb*s of the
fuffering States, it vyou'q'be uo more than equalizing the expeoces
and burdens of War. Let o# however inquire by. what extraor
dinary exertions some States nave reduced their debts, and if in
the projjrcfs of our inquiry we should find that they have got rid
ot their debts, in fonie instance* with little difficulties to them
'elvcs, and in othe/s with little,benefit to their creditors, we shall
not be ready to allow them so much n\prit for their exertion as
they wish to obtain.âSome f/ave paid no interest to their crv
duors for a number of year , b'ut have cut down the capital of
the debt at once, by afaleof confifehted property, or vacant and
ufclefs landsâln this pafe the State ipade no exertions ; her citi
zens were not taxed, por was her government put to any incon
venience or difficultyâtfcie property of her enemies* which Con
grefsat the peace recommended tt/them to restore, or unappro
priated back lands were applied *to'the discharge of the debt,
while the creditor after waiting several years'without receiving
any interest on his certificate was obliged to receive the principal
in confiscated property of wild lands, at an extravagant price.
Others have dil'charged their debts with depreciated'paptr or by
taxes payable in the principal of-their debt, or by Jother arrange
ments as little burdenfomc to the State as advantageous to the cre
ditor. No material injury therefore can reiult to thcic States,
even (hould they never have credit for such payments.
Mr. Smith then observed, that the juilice, policy, expediency,
and even neceflity of the allumption being ev\dent in every view
in which it could be contemplated, and the mifchiets which would
flow from a rejection of it being equally obvious and alarming, he
trusted it would on a further consideration be agreed to. A fund
ing fyftrtn without it would want the only basis on which it Coufd
Aanc\; justice and the confentof the people were necelTary loi its
exigence ; (hould it appear to them partial and unjyih.its opera
tion would be embarraired and the continental creditors them
selves woiild be the firft persons to lament the absence of that ne
â¢ceflary ingredient without which it would be vain arid ineffectual
He then to some of Mr. Jackson's obfervatious.
REMARKS ON THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE,
IN vulgar speech, the word got answers a ftrcat variety of pur
poses : A man has get a horfc ; his house done :-has
got his leg broke ; hasgqt his wheat to reap ; has got to go to
work : A boy has got \u get hisleflon, or has got his(Ton to get:
In short, if I attempt to ok ntion a thousandth part oi the ways by
Which this poof got is abused, I fhouid have a task indeed. Let
arty farmer who comes from his field and fits down to read this
paper, afic himfelf whether it is not quite as easy to fay he has a
horfc, as to lay, he has got a Horfc, and cafier to fay he mujl go, than
to fay, he has got'to go. Let me ask whether it does not found
better to fav.' he mull get a cart," than to fay, 4 * he has got to
get a cart ?" If he ihoutd ihjnk this a matter of no consequence,
I can only lose my labor of writingâno harm will be done.
Again; it is" a custom with our modest country people to.ask
questions thus ; 'you dont want any corn, do you : You have not
any rum to fell ,havc you, you dont want to buy veal, do you ?
New-England.people are much laughed at, for Jthis singular prac
tice ; and indeed it is ridiculous.. Let meafkour market people
why it is not juflt as eafv to ask a decently and directly
at once ;do you want to buy veal; or, will,you buy corn ? One wuo'ld
think it beftto finilh theburincf* dvrettly andhandfomcly.
And here let me to my countrymen a lit-tJe more drci
flon in aiifw'ering aueitions. If I aik a man a civil question, 1
Want a dirfcft artfwer : I want no round aboqt indirect answers,
such as," I don't much care if Ido ;. I don't know but J will; I can't
tell whether 1 will or not. There may be cases when such an inde
cisive ahfWer is neceifary ; but if I ask a man to cat or drink, or
take a'ride with me, 1 want no such answers as," â¢* Why, I don't
care much ifl do."
How mahy at: there le(t ? Sa-jd Ito a man (landing by me ;
WVr a one, replied he. Ne'er a onc y ne'er a one y said I'; this is not
Englilh. Never a one, never a one ; this is Irilh or Scotch, it cer
tainly is not English. So When I ask a man, how many horCes
he keeps,, he tells me, he keeps never a one This is odd indeed !
But when he fays he has none, this is plain intelligible Englilh.

LONDON, JUNE 7.
OUR Constitution if kept upon its original pu
rity, is far superior to any of the boalted
republics of antiquity. In Rome, whose constitu
tion was an improvement on the Grecian models,
the citizens eledfced their Consuls, Prajtors, Tri
bunes of the pewple, &c. but the Senate was an
hereditary body, and all powers might be said to
be committed to their hands ; for though the Tri
bunes, who fat in the porch oÂ£ the Senate House,
might give their "Veto" to any law, yet the
whole of them tnuft agree, asone diflentient voice
would set aside the negative of the reft. In these
kingdoms, however, we ele<fl our Senators, and
were but the Boroughs reformed, our form of
constitutional government would come as near to
perfection, as any political institution can pofli
bly admit.
When the news of the late defeat of the Patri
otsreaclied Namur, several citizens, well afFecfted
to the house of exprefled the higheftfa
tisfaiftion at the event. This was imprudent.
But when they saw a number of wounded men
brought from the Patriot army to the hospitals
of Namur, their exultations increased, which
doubtless were inhuman.
Intheutmoft consternation at the rumours of
a defeat, and enraged at the treachcry and info
568
lence of the Royal party, the populace aOembleil
â¢attacked, pillaged, and completely demolifiied
three houses belonging to tlielioyalills. A child
was accidentally killed in the tumults.
On the Z2d, the populace again ail'embled for
the purpose of devaluation and revenge, but the
garrifoil troops joined the armed citizens and de
feated their deligns.
The exceiles were again renewed 011 the 23d;
at night, and the house of a Bookfellcr was de
ltroyed, and himfelf thrown out of a Window.
An Irilh Gentlemaii being lately alked what ho
thought of Gen. Burgoyne's abilities, replied
â" that, as a military man, he was a deccnt farce
writer." Being asked what he meant by that, fir
Patrick replied.â" the General wrote a good
farce in England, and aifted a bad one in Ame
rica."
Nothing has yet trail spired concerning Dqdtor
Warton's literary occupations at the time of
his death. It has been generally believed that
he had undertaken a new edition of
LolV, at the particular requelt of his Majesty;
and as he was peculiarly c|Ualified both in critical
talents and taste to do honor to such a work, we.
hope to hear that it is at least in such a stare of
advancement as to admit of publication.
COALITION between FRANCE and SPAIN,
ITS NATURAL EFFECTS:
The Grandees of Spain about 300 years ago
fojd the liberties of the people to the then Mo
narch, the ancient constitution of every province
being governed by its own peculiar laws was
abolilhed, and a new system adopted, which
obliged the Nobility, Clergy, and Reprefema
tives of the people to meet, confirm, and record
the decrees of the Sovereign, without allowing
them a negative on any occasion.
This arbitary mode seemed so well formed for
carrying into execution 1 lie opprellive views of
tyranny, that Cardinals Richlieu and Mazarine,
effetfted its eltablifliment in France, deprived the
twelve Provinces of their privilege of making
laws, or rather giving their aflent or diflcnt to
arrets, parted by the King for the Gov eminent of
the Empire, and thereby made France a Monar
chy as absolute as Spain in every other rcfpedL
except on the point of deciding upon civil acti
ons.
The riots in Dublin have been of a very alarm
ing nature, the election mobs fweepingall before
them. Several persons have loft their lives in
consequence of the Military being obliged to fire
on the deluded hirelings of the party in that
kingdom. Ihe ele&ion for the city of Dublin,
concluded something like our Weftuiiniter elec
tion, the mobility of weavers polling over and
over again, in consequence of which, the Duke
of Leinfter's brother, and Mr.Grattan,have been
returned by a larg'e majority. The county of
Dublin election is also finifhed, and Sir Edward
Nevvenham aud Mr. Talbot returned. Mr. Tal
bot is one of those independent gentlemen who
mean to iupport government.
