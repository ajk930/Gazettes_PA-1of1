DISCOURSES ON DAViLA. No. XVII
(CON C LUOID.)
Ses mains, autour du tione, avec A>nfufion,
Scmaient la jalousie, et !a division.
THE Admiral Gafpard de Coligni, had two
different governments ; that of the Isle of
France, and that of Picardie ; but as the laws of
the kingdom, permitted not tll< pofleflion of
more titan one dignity, or i.ne < o cverrÂ»mcr r a'
y T - it m ihu iutc King had destined that
of Picardie, to the Prince de Con de, to appease
his resentment and foften his complaints. The
Prince earnestly desired this favor, to which, in
deed, he hadjuft |>retenfions. His father, and
the King of Navarre had successively held it ;
and the Admiral had resigned it, in considerati
on of ihe Prince. But the death of Henry lid.
happening near the fame time, had hindered the
effect of this arrangement, which had already
been made public. Francis the I Id. had no re
gard to it. At the solicitation of the Guises, and
by a manifeft injustice to the Prince, he granted
this place to Charles de Code, Marechal de Brif
fac, a captain of high reputation and great valor ;
but who having been promoted by the favor of
the Princes of Lorrain, was clolely attached to
them and served them with zeal. Nor was there
more attention paid to Francis of Montmoroncie,
the eldest son of the Constable. He had married
Diana, natural daughter of Henry lid. In con
sideration of this marriage, he had been promis
ed, the office of grand inalter of the King's house
hold, a place which had been long held by his
father. From the firft days of the reign of Fran
cis 11 d. the Duke of Guise, took it for hi in fe If,
that he might add this new eclat to his other
dignities, as well as deprive of it, an house which
he wished to depress. Thus the Duke and the
Cardinal, embraced with ardor, every occasion of
mortifying their rivals, and aggrandizing them
selves. The Oueen mother, who forefaw that
this unlimited ambition and this violent liatied,
mull have lata I e iirct.3, delired that they ihoukl
aÂ«ft with more moderation, management and dex
terity ; but (lie dared not, in the beginning, op
pose herfelf to the wills, nor traverse the deiigns
of tliofe, whole influence was the pricipal lupport
of her authority.
At tliis time the Bourbons, excluded from all
parts of the government, banished from court,
and without hopes of carrying their complaints
to the foot of the throne, beginning to reflccl
upon the (ituation of their affairs, and the con
dud: of their enemies, who, not content with
their present grandeur, labored by all forts of
means to perpetuate it, resolved, to remain no
longer inactive fpeftators of their own misfor
tunes, but to prevent the ruin that threatened
them. To this purpose a convention was called,
and we (hall soon fee what kind of convention it
was. Anthony King of Navarre, after having
left in Beam his foia, yet an infant, under the
condudt of the Queen his wife, as in an asylum,
at a diitance from that conflagration, which they
fkw ready to be lighted up, in France, repaired
to Vendome, with the Prince of Conde, already
returned from hisembafly ; the Admiral, Dande
lot, and the Cardinal of Chatillon his brothers,
Charles Coinpte de la Rochefoucault, Francis
Vidame de Chartres, Antony Prince of Portien,
all relations or common friends, aflembled also,
with leveral other noblemen attached for many
years to the lioufes of Montmorencie aud Bour
bon. The Constable, who, altlio to all appear
ance wholly engaged in the delights of private
life, secretly set in motion all the springs of this
enterprize, had sent to this aflembly at Ardres,
Jiis ancient and confidential Secretary, with in-
ItrulHons concerning the affairs to be there agi
tated. They took into consideration the part
which it vvasneceflary to a<ft in the present con
junction of affairs. All agreed in the fame end,
but opinions as usual, were divided concerning
the means. All equally felt the atrocious affronts
committed a gain ft the Princes of the blood, from
whom the Guifej had not only taken the firfl.
places in the government, but the small number
of dignities which had remained to them.
They law evidently that the design was nothing
less, than to oppress these Princes and their par
tizans. All perceived the necessity of preventing
so preffinga danger, without waiting for the last
extremity. But they were not equally agreed
concerning the measures proper to ward it off.

PHILOSOPHICAL REFLECTIONS
ON THE LATE
REVOLUTION IN FRANCE,
AND THE CONDU v r OF
THE DISSENTERS IN ENGLAND;
IN A LETTE* TO
THE REV. DR. PRIESTLEY.
BY J. COU RT E N A V

CONTINUED FROM OUR LAST.
I SHALL now proceed in. demAftrating, that
the Chriltian religion is to all intenrs and pur
poses aboliflied in Ki anceâ-and that the Nation
al Allembly have covertly and infidioully intro
duced a fyftein of atheism in its Head. The Se
nate of democrats have commenced their impious
Scheme by abolishing tythesâa provision appro
priated and lantftified, jure divino, for the comfor
table Support of the clergy, by Heathens, Jews,
and Christians. They have sacrilegiously pre
sumed to seize on the ancient revenue of the
church, under the impious pretext of public good
âof encouraging agriculture, by easing the pea
sants of an unequal and oppressive ecclesiastical
â corvfi âand of providing a better and more Sui
table maintenance for the secular and parochial
priefts, who alone perform the refpe<ftive duties
of their fundliom Thus have the National Af
(embjy reduced atheism into afyftem, by seizing
on the lands of the clergy, with an avowed de
sign ofeither pledging them as afecurity for the
national debt, or felling them to Turks, Jews and
Infidels, for the difchargeof it Bertdes, ifbifh
ops, arch-birtiops, abbes, and the superior and dig
nified ranks of the hierarchy, are deprived of
riches, immunities, power, and grandeur, how
can they shew their contempt of them ? Youin
vidioufly snatch from these S:neca' t, tliefe Chris
tian rtoics, the sublime merit of optional virtue,
by compelling them to pradlice temperance and
moderation, not from choice, but necessity.
A limilar sacrilegious attempt to abolifli tythes
in Ireland, is a melancholy proof of the turbu
lent and innovating spirit of the present times.
The deprefled state of the clergj too evidently
appears by the style of their writings. Their
arguments are singly founded on the impolicy and
injustice of depriving them of a provision, sanc
tioned by antiquity, and solemnly entailed on
them by the laws of the land. They have given
up the vantage ground on which they stood,
ftript themselves, of the celestial armour, the pa
noply divine,with which they were clad, and have
rashly ventured into the field naked and unarmed.
They have succeeded accordingly. Ifthe cler
gy once weakly admit the profane interference
of parliament ; if they once admit, that this pro
vision may be modified, and even by
the fame authority ; if the contert is merely to
reft on the fallacious deductions of hum an reason,
it would indeed be difficult for the church to
maintain Even thefpeciousftate
ment of the celebrated author of the -wealth of na
ttors has little weight with me ; for'grantingthat
tythes are often a fifth, and even a fourth, instead
of a tenth ; though they are a check to industry,
&c. still the more enequal and more bppreffive
this sacred burthen may be, the more meritori
ous it is in those who fubmir. to it from a confci
entiousjmotive, without murmuring and repining.
A leading member of the Irilh House of Com
mons (Mr. Grattan) has expatiated in his uiual
stile of energetic, but delusive eloquence, on the
great advantage which the church would derive
from an a<ft of Commutation.âLaw-suits, tftck
erings and aniruoimes, be affected, would cÂ£afe
at once ; and the mild spirit of peace and Christi
an charity, would mutually endear the paflorand
his flock to each other. The clergy, no doubt,
are perfectly sensible of this ; and only perlift in
claiming tythes, as being their exclusive proper
ty by divine institution ; and thinking that by ac
cepting any commutation, however beneficial,
they would betray the cause of God and religion.
And now, Sir, permit me to address you, in the
most serious jnanner, on the most serious fubjetft.
What can the inadnefs of democracy alledge a
gainst episcopacy ? Were not bishops instituted
by the apostles themselves, to enlighten and go
vern the primitive church ? Though they soon
displayed an exterior pomp and splendour in
their vestments, and in the celebration of divine
worfliip ; though they a (Turned imperial grandeur,
inhabited palaoes. ascended their thrones, though

they cenfurcd, controled, and excommunicated
emperors ; yet they only submitted to this pageau
try, and reluctantly exetcifed this temporal pow
er, merely to impress the congregation of the
faithful with a holy awe and veneration for the
majesty of the church; well knowing that found
morality and the social duties could left securely
on no other basis. Dr. Monflicim's mifrcprefen
tation on this very interelting point, is deferyed'
ly treated with contempt.âThat bold andinfidi
ous writer, under the specious pretext of candour
and moderation, ini'pires his readers Vritli an a
verfon to all ecclefiaflical power, and with in
dignation against the clergy, for having invaria
bly fomented religious co'ntroverfy on my fieri -
ous unintelligible tenets ; for encouraging per
fccution, and promoting the misery of mankind
in this world, by infufing into their minds a spi
rit of hatred, malice, and nncharitablenefs ;
which at lalt became the theological cliaratteri
ftic of every variousdif-ordant feet of Cliriftiani
ty. But if this ecclesiastical liiftorian had been
candid, [even allowing the fact,] he should have
fairly acknowledged that the unrelenting viru
lence and imbittered rancour of persecution are
the molt infallible criterions of true belief, and
the belt proof of a fervent and lincere zeal for
religion. As each feet stigmatized its antagonist
by the odious denomination of heretic, âArians 1
and Athanafians, mutually actuated by thepurell
motives of brotherly love and affection, inflicted
a momentary and transient punilhinent on the
bodies of each other, either by the sword or the
ltake ; left by continuing too long in their re
fpeitive fchifniatic opinions, they might forfeit
all hope of salvation.
Thus the lame actions, erroneously considered
on mere abftrait notions of philanthropy, may
well appear unjust, cruel, and barbarous ; but
their very eflence is changed when viewed
through this just theological medium; for the
genuine and benelicient spirit of orthodoxy cori
fecrates the apparent inhumanity of the aitiori,
by fanctifying the motive. /7*o be continued.)
FRANCE.
NATIONAL ASSEMBLY.
Sittings of May 26.
THE incendiary protestations of those who
style themselves Catholics of Nifines, and the
declarations of those difaffedicd to the Aflembly,
become more and more despicable. The city of
Louis-le-Saulnier seems itill to lay fonie stress on
these writings, in declaring all those traitors to
their country who dare to sign them.
Clcrj/tont terrand, who had subscribed five mil
lions to buy National domains, has by an Address
read this morning, offered to double the value
of its former donation.
M. Tour dn Pin made some complaints, ift.
Against the Municipality of Haguenau, which,
kept in the prison a huflar, for whose liberty
this minister fays he had given orders. This bu
siness was lent to the committee of reports. 2d.
Against the Municipality of Lyons, which has
written to him, that they think at present there
is some danger in putting into motion the troops
of the line, in consequence of which they refufe
to let the detachment of the Royal Guienne set
off. The intention of the Minister of the war
department was to fill their place by a detach
ment of the Penthievre dragoons. The Allem
bly made no decree on this grievance.
M. Bailly riling, exposed the disorders which
foi these three days past have troubled the ca
pital. A number of foreign vagabonds swarm ac
the bar : the people incline to the most cruel ex
ecutions. On Monday two men accused of theft
were hung without any form of law. Yesterday
another who was accused, had the fatal cord al
leady faftened, when M. de la Fayette came up
and laved his life : and when one of these mad
men, who stirred up the multitude, cried out,
that the unhappy wretch ought to be retaken,
the illustrious commander himfelf immediately
seized the disturber and conducted him to the
Chatelet. A new species of courage, and a fub
liine homage paid to the laws !
The debate on the order of the day, relative
to the Eclefiaftical plan, was about to be opened
but it was interrupted by the entrance of m!
Neckar, who read a discourse on the prefenc
of the Finances. The tone of that Minis
ter was changedâHe no longer presented thole
gloomy and defpcrate pictures, which, fiace the
[Wholf. No. 140.]
May 29.revolution, had so frequently affli&ed the As
sembly. His discourse breathed nothing but the
jnoll confolatary profpetfs.
The Deputies of the Municipality of Marseilles,
heard at the bar, amply vindicated the con
du<fl of their conllituents.âThey had, in obedi
ence to the decree of the Afleinbly, suspended
the demolition of the forts, but the rage of the
populace was not to be A striking
circumttance, mentioned by one of the Deputies,
almoil jaltified the popular emotion "On one
of the corner stones of the Citadel," said he,
" were found inscribed,
Louis the Great ordered this Citadel to be
conflrudted to prevent the citizen of Marseilles
from abandoning themselves to the delirium of
Liberty !"
BERLIN, May 22.
Immediately upon Che decease of Count Schu
lenburgh Blumberg, who died very l'uddenly on
Sunday lait, the King sent for Count Schulenburg
Rebnert, who has lived retired upon his estate
near Magdeburg, for near two years, reinstated
him in all his former offices, and appointed him
President of the War, with the title of First Mi
nister of War. It is thought this change will be
followed by others..
BASTI A, May 21.
The States have resolved to cite the Dukes d*
Urfel and d'Aremberg, and Viscount Walkiesâ
and in default oftheir appearance, to confifcate
their pofleffions.
NETHERLANDS,
ExtraCi of a Utter from Lisle, June 3.
TheLegeois are said to have been beat by the
Palatines near Maeftriclit.
The people of Menin and Ipres who were on
their march to Antwerp to liberate General Van
tier Merfcli, have been flopped by their own coun
trymen in Flanders, who pointed the cannon at
them, and forced them to retreat, instead ofin
creafing their numbers, as was thegeneral opin
ion. The influence of the aristocracy has cor
rupted the minds of the Flemings, and produced
the fame alterations of fentimentas their finilter
machinations have - effeifled in Brabant. It has
also prevailed so far as to drive away the noble
defender of the opprefled, General M. Sandelin,
whole firm and undaunted language of truth to
theCongrels, fufliciently accounts forthe oppref.
fion to which he is now become another vufliinâ
they have instituted a criminal process again(t him
â'and he has been obliged to fly from Ghent.â
You may judge by the inclosed translation of his
memoir, how inveterate must be the enmity of
those ambitious minds againita man of his fcnti
ments.
The feftival of unity between the troops and
th( national guard, concluded on Wednedayâ
the Mayor or the town, and the commander of
the national guard and garrison, were drawn in
a splendid triumphal car through the cityâafter
which they all adjourned to an elegant dinner at
the Nouvelle Aventure.
In the evening a large party made an excurilon
to the Abby de Loos, where they emptied the cel
lar of all the wine the Monks had ii} store. The
latter seemed to give it with the best grace in
the world.
Great preparations are making on the El'pla
nade for the general confederation of the Nation,
al guard on Sunday next. A magnificent temple
is erecting for taking the oath."
LONDON, June y.
A youngman in afever who had been ill fev^r
al days, apparently died lait week at Chester
The apothecary, upon examining the body found
a little warmth about the regio carthiacoâon
which ftridt orders were given for the body not
to be laid out, and proper means were advised to
be employed. The next day he remained near
ly in the fame situationâas the warmth of the
breath still cotuinued, similar means were purfu.
Ed, and on the third day ligns of life appeared.
This instance of the return of life should awaken
caution, and prevent inconsistent hurry inlaying
out the dead, and precipitating the funeral cere
monies.

By Command oj the Prejident of the United Slates of America.
HENRY KNOX.i Secretary for the
' ) Department of War.
â¦ NEW-YORK, AUGUST 14.
Yesterday the treaty of peace and friendfhip between the Uni
ted States and the Creek nation was solemnly ratified by the con
trailing parties, in Federal Hall, in prefenceof alargeaflertiblvof
citizens âThe Vice-President of the United Statesâthe great offi
cers of Stateâhis Excellency the Governorâand of several mem
ben of both Houses of Congfcfs.
At 18 o'clock the President of the United States, and his faitâ
General Knox, the commiflioner ; the clerks of the department
of the Secretary at war; Col. M'Gillivrav, and the Kings, Chiefs
and warriors of the Creek nation being a'ffembled, the treaty was'
read by the Secretary of the President of the United States
The President then add reded Col. M'Gillivray, the Kings
Chiefs, and warriors) he said that he thought the treatyjuft andr-l
qual ;ano stated the mutual duties of the contrafling parties; which
address was communicated sentence after sentence.by Mr. Cornell
sworn interpreter i to all of which the CieeJts gave an audible assent
The President then signed the treatyâafter which he prefentei a
string of beads as a loken of perpetual peace; and a paper of to
bacco to smoke in remembrance of it ; Mr. M'Gillivray rose
made a ftiort reply to the President, and received the tokens. '
This was succeeded by the (hake of peace, every one of the
Creeks palling this friend>y salute with the President; a song of
peace performed by the Creeks concluded this highly interesting
solemn and dignified tranfaSioa.
We are ini'ormed, by a letter dated July 3d,
from Kingston, Jamaicaâ" That no (hips were
to fail for Britain until the 2jth of July, and then
to have a convoy. On the second ult. arrived
there the 6sd regiment, under the command of
Lieutenant-Colonel Charles Horneck, which had
been embarked from Ireland, and proceeded to
Halifax, Nova-Scotia, where Lieutenant Col.
Horneck found orders to fail direcfily, without
landing, for Jamaica. This corps is to be follow
ed by the jth battalion of the 60th, which is hour
ly expetfied, to augment the military force in Ja
maica. Another regiment is also ordered from
Ireland, with a reinforcement of men of war,
both daily looked forâevery preparation of war
is making. Lord Effingham,the governor, is in
a very bad state of health, and it is thought will
not recover.

The news-papers liave paragraphed Congress
for the ilownefs oftheir proceedingsâthe length
of the lilt oftheir acts will take ofi'a great deal
from the force of the charge. In that lilt are
many acts comprehending objetfls in the liigheft
degree contentious and arduous ; and rendered
doubly so by the state jealousies and prejudices
which this government inherits from its anceitor,
the confederation. As much of the ordinary bu
siness ot legislation has becn done, as could be
expetfted, and at last the great things are provid
ed for, which the people have been so anxious
about. The debt is funded, a law has palled for
feeling the accounts, and public credit lias a
foundation to reft upon. Tiiis, however impor
tant, is not all. A system is formed for reducing
the debt by purchases in the market, with the
surplus revenue of a million of dollars, and witij
a further sum to be borrowed.âThis will save a
great deal to the public, form a finking fund,
gradually to pay off the whole debt, diminish
the loss to the country by foreign speculations, and
inflead of keeping the money locked up in the
revenue chest, it will scatter it among the peo
ple ; it will restore confidence in government,
aiulraife it higher than it ever was. Little more
than a year of the existence of the new govern
ment has elapsedâwhat more has the molt: fan

America, tho relpedted for the wisdom of its con
stitution, has been considered as in a state of
childhood with regard to credit and money mat
ters. The report of the Secretary of the Treafii
ry, and the concluding measures of this feffionof
Congress, adopted in conformity to his opinion,
will raise the reputation of our country. A fyf
temis begun which needs only tobefteadily pur
sued, to extinguish our debt, and to fecureall the
advantages which we have hoped to derive, from
the eftaWifhment of the constitution. Probably
there is not in the world a nation which has half
so good c a life for hops, as the American.âsuch
an expectation, so well founded and so nearly re
alized, tends to prove itfelf true It inspires the
people with afpirit and energy, which increases
their strength. Those who kindle discord, mur
mur agamlt the government, as unfaithful, lazy
and ignorant, and croak about ruin as the conse
quence, make themselves and others unhappy
poison that harmony, and dainpthat enterprize[
lull of hope, which would otherwise be at work
to bring about better times.
A cool observer will have frequent occafionsto
wonder at the readiness with which accufationa
again It government are made and believed. The
charge is taken for true, and instead of collecting
proofs, we find the acrufcrs engaged iu IhewiaS
the pernicjous consequences of the allcdgcd de
linquency. Congrels is inveighed again ft for
proceeding tardily, an d the world is told that
many months have been trifled away, not onlv
without doing any good, but with a design to pro"-
tract the term of the payment of their wages.
To enquire is a work of the underftandingÂ±to
rail and call names is a matter of paflion. All
have paflions and very often feel themâand thnfe
who have the lead undemanding are most under
their dominion : But tho all have some under
itanding too, they will not always make the bed
u l e Â° f what they have. It requires the knowledge
of lomefadts, and some leisure to compare
together, to make up a found judgment upon fub
jetfs which lie remote from the path of common
enquiry Gongrefs Ihould be compared with
other pubhcbodies. AH bodies are flow in motion.
But it may be questioned whether business has
Â« en iT re tranfatfed in the state
assemblies than m Congress. Great which
divide and agitate the whole society, becaule
they portend the most important and extensive
coniequences, cannot be hurried, Very often
by giving time for passion towaftc itfelf in fume
right measures are approved at the time of their
adoption, which on their being firft announced
were obno*,ous.__The aflumption of the state
debts was long in debate. The public has the
means o f judging, by reading the Gazettes, whe!

our rulers too happy that those things which havt

ACCOUNT OT THE CREEK NATION.
|
THE Creeks, who call themselves Mufcokies, fre composed
ot various tribes, who, after tedious wars, tl*fcught it good
policy to unite to support themselves aga'mft the Cho&aws, &c.â
They consist of Apalakias, Alibamons, Abecas, Cawittaws,
Coofas, Confhacs, Coofa&es, Chacfihoomas, Natchez, Oconis,
Okohoys, Pakanas, Oakmulgis, Taenfas, Tallcpoofcs, Weetum
kas, and some others. Their union has not only .lowered iheir
fir ft hope, but enabled them to overawe the ChoÂ£u3s and mher
nations.
They inhabit a noble and fruitful country, where they will be
come civilized, more and more every day ; and where they, or
some other people, more civilized and powerful, will one day
enjoy all the bleflings, which the superior advantages of their foil,
climate and situation can bestow. They are an expert, sagacious,
politic peopleâextremely jealous of their rightsâavcrfe to part
ing with their landsâand determined to defend them against all
inv.tfions, to the utmost extremity.
They are remarkably well (haped ; are expert swimmers ; and
are a sprightly hardy race. They teach their horses to swim in a
very extraordinary manner ; and, fnd great use therein, in their
war parties. They have abundance ot tame cattlc and swineâ
turkeys, ducks, and other poultry : They cultivate tobacco, rice,
Indian corn, potatoes, beans, peas, cabbage, &c.
Their country abounds with melons, peaches, strawberries,
plumbs, grapes, and some other fruits.
To {tranters they are hospitable, nay liberally kind to excess,
even to white men, when any above the rank ol a trader visits
them. With those they are punctual, and honest in their dealings:
and thty afford them protection from all insults. Many of the
nations are addicted to trade as principals, or as fa&ors for the
'ATES.
EiAuCUST 5,
PROVIDE NC F
London company, who are allowed by the Spaniards a free
trade with them, ia a stipulated number of (Uips from London
annually. . . .
Their women are handsome : and considering their (late or ci
vilization, many of them are very cleanly. Their dreifes at fef
tivals and public dances, are rich and expensive. They are ex
ceedingly attentive to strangers, whorr: they serve with excellent
i provisions, well cookcd, which are always accompanied With a
bottle of cryftaline bear's oil) and another of Virgin honey, full as
pure.
Their country, or what they claim, is bounded northward by
nearly the 34th degree of latitude ; and extends from the Tom
beck lee or Mobille river, to the Atlantic ocean. It is well wa
tered by many navigable streams, leading to bays and harbors,
which will become of great importance in pcace and war ; and is
abundant in deer, bears, wild turkeys, and small game.
The men value themselves on being good hunters, fiHiermcn,
and warrior*, so much that their women Hill do most of the work
of the field, which in this fine country and climate, is not very
laborious. 'They arc, however, adopting the use of black slaves
They are the only red people I know, who frequently keep by
them store of liquor, by way of refreftiment only ; or who make
any great use of milk, eggs and honey.
Their country, amongst other valuable commodities, is poffeU
ed of a number of extraordinary fait springs, some of which pro
duce oncthira fait.âAnd their rivers arc remarkably ilored with
the bed of fi(h.
Hospitable and kind as fhefe people are to friendsâthey are,
if poflible still more inveterate to en which is an exception
to true bravery ; l>ut it is the cfFeÂ£l education.
Whilst the Biitifh pottered the sea coasts of East and Weft Flo
rida, the Creeks lived on good terms with them : And ihcy are
now in as ltritt friendfhip with the Spaniards, who cultivate their
eftcem with great attention, and ftriÂ£t regard to jufticc, indeed
with a liberality some other nations are ftungfers to : no nation
has a more contemptible opinion of the white men's faith, in ge
neral, thanthefe people. Yet they place great confidence in the
United States ; and wish to agree with them, upon a permanent
boundary, over which the Southern States shall not trespass.
Mr. M'Gillivray, whose mother was principal ot the nation,
and who has several fitters married to leading men, is so highly ef
teemcd for his merits, that they h-jve formally eletted hnn their
sovereign, and vetted him with considerable powers. This gen
tleman wijhed to have remained a citizen of the United States ;
but having served under the British during the late war, and his
property being considerable in Georgia, he could not be indulged :
He therefore retired amongst his friends, and has zealously taken
part in their interettsand politics.
L DON, June 5.
PARIS.
Paris has lately been troubled by some infiii*-
redtions ; happily a few only, who deserved it,
became viiftinrs to them. In twenty-four hours
peace was restored to this town, for which the
proclamation of M. Bailly had made way.
The revivingfpeech of M. Necker, of which
we yefterdav gave an extradt, shewed the firlt
dawn of public felicity, and every body is look
ing forward to the molt agreeable hopes. The
King's Proclamation caused the molt lively emo
tions in the affeinbly.
The citizens, melted and rejoiced, repeated
its exprefiions with enthufiafin : a thousand eyes
wiflied for the happiness of feeing the best of
men and the molt upright of Kings. They en
joyed thispleafure yelleiday morning.
M. de la Fayette had fixed on yesterday (Sun
day) for a general review of the National Guard
in the Champs de Mars. Each division was to
provide so many men : in all something more
than four thousand.
The King was on horse-back early in the morn
ing, and, after a turn on the Boulevard, he crof
ted over to the place of review.
He was no sooner perceived by the people,
than the found Vive le Roi (Long live the King)
resounded from all parts with an enthuliafm be
fore seldom seen. Even the nation was for a
time forgotten, and wholly taken up with tha
thoughts of their monarch. They offered no
vows but for him, and his person is so much be
loved, that it is contemplated with the highest
pleasure.
As his Majesty knows the hearts of his people
fufficiently to bs certain that it is not his pomp,
but himlelf, which is beloved by them, he was
in a plain undi ess ; his coat was green, and not
seemingly very new; and his hat, though fin all,
was adorned with a handsome cockade of three
colours. The National Guard, for the firft time,
exercised before him amongst the repeated ac
clamations of an immense crowd, who were ne
ver.weary of flaewing the King how much they
loved him, and how truly they rejoice to fee
hini enjoying liberty and happiness. The King,
on his iide, shewed the greatest sensibilityâit
was easy to perceive that he smiled unaffe<fted]y,
by a few tears of joy, which stole in fpight of
him down his cheeks. The review concluded a
bout halt part twelve.
REVOLUTION 'IN HUNGARY.
Leopold 11. determined to recover his author
ity in the Netherlands, though at a greater ex
pence of blood and treasure than the object of
contention will jullify, is compelle'd to secure a
territory more valuable, extensive, and interest
ing to the House of Austria.
In (hort, the Hungarians have begun to nego
ciate with their Sovereign. According to the
ancient fyftemof things, such negociations would
terminate in the death or exile of the proje<flors.
But ancient records must no longer form the data
of political induiftion. According to the new or
der of events, the gentle petition of the Hunga
rians will grow into bold remonstrance, and ter
minate in fucrefsful rebellion. All the arts and
influence of the Belgic Confederacy will be prac
ticed among the discontented Hungarians, with
560
a view to divide and weaken the armies of Au
stria. And this may ultimately lead to a total
extinction of the Austrian Monarchy ! ! !
Great indeed are the revolutions of modem
times. The next century will open on a new
face of affairsâperhaps 011 an universal Repub
lic.
