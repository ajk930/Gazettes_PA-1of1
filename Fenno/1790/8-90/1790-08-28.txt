DISCOURSES ON DAVILA
No. XVIII. â CONCLUDED
l,'uÂ» et I'antre parti cruel cgalement,
Ainfi que dans le crimc, eft dans l'aveuglement.
THIS discourse pronounced with a military
tone, had already agitated minds before
disposed to take arms, both from attachment to
his house, and their private intcrelts. But the I
Admiral, Coligni, who Wighed more maturely
all the confequerices of such an enterprize, alone
Ventured to oppose the opinion of the Prince, by
advising to employ in the execution ofhisdefign,
a mean more proper to ensure the success of it.
" It would be," said tolignl, " too dfcfperate a
fefolution to expose so openly to the hazards of
war, the fortunes of the house of Bourbon, and
of so great a number of persons allied to their
blood, or attached to their interests. We are
not supported by any forces at home, or alliances
abroad. We have no fortified places, and are
without troops, and without money. In the Jiin
pollibility to act with open force, let us substitute
policy in the itead of force. Let us endeavor,
â¢without difcoveriug ourselves, to employ other
arms, to execute for us, what we are not in a
condition to undertake for ourselves, The king
dom is filled with a multitude of people, who
have embraced the doctrine lately introduced by
Calvin. The severity of the researches made far
them, and the rigour of their punishments, re
duce theih to despair. and to the desire as well
as neceflity of braving every danger to rescue
themselves from a deltiny so horrible. They all
know, thatthe duke of Guise, and especially the
Cardinal of Lorrain, are the principal authors of
the persecution ; that this lÂ»(t pursues ardently
their destruction, in the Parliaments and in the
King's councils, and never ceases to rail at their
doctrines, in his public harrangues and private
4 conversations. If the difconteuts of this multi
tude have not blazed out, it has been merely tor
â¢want ps a leader capable of guiding it, and of ani
mating it, by his example. If they should be ft 1-
jnulated ever so little, they will blindly confront
the greateil dangers, in the hope of delivering
themselves from the misfortunes which threaten
them. Let us avail ourselves of this resource ;
let us encourage this multitude, already disposed
to com motions ; let us give a form to their de
signs ; let its arm their hatred against the Guilesi;
let us put them in a condition to attack thefc
ftrsmgers, in good order and with advantage.
Our designs, in this way,will execute themselves,
without expofingor committing us, with our ap
pearing to have any part in them. In augment
ing our forces with all those of the Calvinilts, we
{hall support ourselves by the protection of the
Protestant Princes of Germany, and of Elizabeth
Queen of England, who patronize openly the
iu;w religion- Our cause will become better and
our pretext more plausible. We will reject upon
the Protestants the boldness of their enterprize,
and we shall convince the whole world, that it is
neither interelt norambition, but limply the dif
ference in religion which has excited us to arms.
It should be remembered here, that Davila was
a Catholic, and Coligni a Protestant. The latter,
one of the greatelt, altlio the molt unfortunate
men of his age, was as sincere in religion, as pure
in morals, and as honourable in the whole con
duct of his life, as any one of his contemporaries.
That he was desirous of engaging the Bourbons
and M'ontmorencics to favwr the Calvinifts and
liberty â of conscience, is probable : but he is re
y>refentiÂ°d by the best French Historians, as so
much attached to the King, as to have been even
suspected by his party. The harrangue which
Davila pure into his mouth, is tco much like a
mere politician, and too little like a philosopher
er a christian, to be consistent with his character.

PHILOSOPHICAL REFLECTIONS
On the late
REVOLUTION IN FRANCE, Vc.
CONTINUATION,
National Afl'embly, poflefled by the fame
X mischievous dxmon of democracy, have ac
tually proceeded to abolish titles and reduce
penlions.
1 hope a few impartial reflections on this very
interelling point, may in some measure obviate
the pernicious tendency of such levelling repub
lican notions.âAs the French nobletle always faj
crifice to the graces, they derived their captivat
ing politeness, and inimitable addrels, from the
alhduity of this pleasing devotion. They gave
adecided ton to iociety in exa<st proportion to the
diftin<ftions of rank and birth. A simple ntonfieur
edged in, as he could, through the half opened
door of a lady's aflembly-room ; but whenever
an archbishop, a prince of the blood, or an am
ballador, was announced, " ouvrez les deux bat
tanti pour monfeignr. I'archive que," was the fafhi
onable language. A nice and faftidous
who had been used to good company, could in
stantly discover due et pair, a (linple duke, a mar
quis, a viscount, or count by the condescending
hauteur, the dignified familiarity, or graceful
negligence of returning a bow, or presenting a.
(huff-box to an inferior, with as much precilion
as if he had examined their refpecSive patents.
But all these enchanting accomplishments will
be soon negletSed. The eye of taile will fpeeai
ly lole this exquisite discrimination, which was
never before attained in ancient or modern limes.
L'amour, la chajfe, le ftrvice, I' agriment de la fo
ciete, les mots heureux, let petits joins, will give
place to the triejle of party ; and the ennui of
litics, to the tumults of fatftion, and the conflicfts
of ambition. The gay and seducing attendance
of the toilet will be defprted for the senate ; and
a tedious debate 011 the constitution will
the attention more than a new dance at the opc-
[Whole So. i 44-3Of a ballet at Versailles. A poetical etijiotrut
who feels for the decadenc: offcis country, laments
this fatal change of manners in the following pa*
thetic and affecting lines :
" Autrefois, Jans la France,
*â¢ La prefenced'un due faifoit taire tin marquis <
" DevÂ»nl l'tiomme cour adrois
" Un gcutilhomme de province
" N'auroit oft rcftcr aflii.
" Un bourgeois refpeftoit le noble le plus mince |
'â¢ Les plus grands impofoient tonjours aux plus pctits |
" El e'etoit un ordrc admirable :
" Majs I'aujonrdliui dans ce Paris
" C' t(l un despotisme effroyable ;
" Tout le mindty dit fan avis "
How different is our situation at this moment I
Ho* triumphant the contrail ! By the aufpicioua
exercise of the prerogative, the British and Irish
peerage have been liberally increased during the
present reignâAs birth, fortune, and desert are
not faftidiouily deemed indispensable qualificati
ons, the gratitude of the new peer to the crown
jsinfured, as lie can only ascribe his promotion
to the gracious favor of his fovereign,and the be
nign influence of the ininiller. Thus the pride
a*id arrogance of alluming merit are effe<ftually
checked ; and a courtly complaisant race of 110
hies gradually formed ; all actuated by the true
Tpirit of arillocracy, and implicitly devoted to
the crown ; always ready to support its preroga
tives, and maintain the splendid privileges of
their own order, againfl vulgar prejudice, and
popular encroachments.
for though the lords derive their honor from
the crown, the fountain of all honor ; Hill as they
are only trustees, they lhould be ever ready to
reiign it with alacrity on any great political cri
sis. By a spirited exertion, founded on this ge
nerous fentiinent, a few noble peers, [if report is
to be credited] gallantly defpifirtg reproach and
obloquy, and disdaining to be bound by too rigid
and scrupulous an adherence to their word, sav
ed the king, the church, and the nation, by vo
ting againlt the Eall India bill in 1 783.
Oil the fame maxim, a desertion of friends,
party, an 1 principle, may foinetimes beconfider
ed as a political tefl, and as a just, fair, and con
ltitutioual claim to a pension and peerage ; be
ing a fort of feudal homage, and the mod une
quivocal proof of profound duty, loyalty, and
attachment. Surely even the malignity of facti
on mutt admit, that the elevation of foul which
indignant virtue inspires, could alone induce any
person to a<ft what is commonly, but very erro
neously, deemed a dishonorable part in politics.
V Â°*'id the mod unprincipled administration a
bandonfuch an intrepid convert, to be vilified,
traduced, and exposed to the bitter taunts, and
contemptuous f'neers of a calumniating oppositi
on No : let a man of such heroic merit never
be consigned to difgrare ; let him be ennobled
by a title, and enriched by a Pension, in order to
excitc a generous emulation in others, and as the
only adequate reward and consolation he him
felf can relish.
I have also, Sir, often reflected with fingnlar
fatisfaL r tion on the pleasing mode in which civil
fints were carried on in France ; where even the
decifiens ofjuftice were hiafled by the gentle influ.
ence of manners and customs,& blended with their
social system of policy. The PrefiJent wag usually
foliated in person, by his noble or fair clients,
and their flare of the cafe was liflened too with
the mofr polite refpedl and attention. As gal
lantry and law were happily united, ladies with
8' eat condescension visited the judge at his own
'chamber.â When beauty pleaded her cause irre
iiftably in private, what a faint impression could
even the eloquence of an Erlkine make in open
cou " â¢ Sometimes an amorous proposition, ex
prelied with the utinoft delicacy, drop'd from
the judge, and if favorably received, le froces
etoitgagni. A French critic has produced a fpe
ciinen of elegant wit, addrefied by a judicial ma
gistrate to a charming Alitor, on this nice point,
equally honorable to himfelf and the jurifpru
uenoe of his country : The equivoque of a legal
term is happily preserved ; for as the author
was a lawyer,he remembered the profefTion in his
poetical rapture, and rested his claim to recibro
city on a double entsudre
11 Vous avez chez moi Tibre acces.,

But the barbarous spirit of democracy has in
terrupted this tender intercourse ! This fenti
mental mode of conducing law-suits ! Judicial
inagilb-ates will no longer be permitted to pur
chase offices. A previous study and lono- prac
tice in the courts will be elteemed indifpenf.ble
<] uficaiions for the bench ; and consequently
youngmep will be excluded, on whole generous
feelings the tears and solicitations of the fair ne
ve. fail in exciting the warmed emotions.âln
ex ,ble bourgsoh j.iiies will be eltabli/hed, who
may p-efume to j :dge both of the law and fad ;
no defH, e;ice will be p.iid to birth, rank or rich
es ; and an accompli (lied courtier, perhaps a fa
vonre of his fovereigu, will be treated like one
of the canaille.
But the tvjf will not flop here : not only the
loft intercourse which has been just described,
will no longer be tolerated, but all the delica
cies of politeffe will be abolilhedj and ancient rus
ticity revived. " The ideas which the Greeks
formed of politeness, mult hiave been very dif
ferent from our's," fays Mr. Hume, iri quoting
this passage from Menander : " It is not in the
power of the Gods to make a polite soldier."
l'he reason is obvious.âThe turbulent spirit of
licentious equality difFufed among the Grecian
republics, inspired a contempt for those finer so
cial arts, the original invention of which even
Mr. Dutens admits to be modern They disdain
ed to acquire that refpettful addrefs,that delicate
adulation, and honourable subserviency to the
pleasure and inclination of others, in which the
veiy ellence of true politeness consists. Such
a sensitive plant shrinks from the rude hand ot
democracy, andean be only cultivated to its ut
most perfection undef the genial influence and
cheering beams of court sunshine. The authoi
of Esprit des Loix, who saw this finely exeniplifi
ed in his own country, remarks, -with patriotic
exultation, " that politeness and arbitrary pow
er made an equal progress among the Romans."
The converse of this pi opofitionis likewise true.
The French will soon lofethat boaftedfuperiori
ty which has so long excited the envy and emu
lation of Europe. Even the Dutch, under the
protection and auspices of the Pruflian monarch,
will speedily be drilled into more refinement, and
excel them in every graceful and elegant accom
pli (hment. As amiablenefs of character is attain -
ed by the agreeable art of concealing the boiste
rous tallies of pallion, and restraining the dif<r U ft.
ing bluntnefs of sincerity, politeness and diflunu
lation are indiflolubly connected, and always
H jurifh under the protection of royalty. This
exterior varnish pleases ihe eye, though it dis
guises the heart as painting glass, beautifies it
but renders itlefs tr; ufparent.

LONDON, June II
The French patriots are greatly elated with a
recent vitftory o*Â£r the ai iltoci arics, in the French
Netherlandsâthe regiments of Vintimille and all
the regulars in the garrison of the place, have
entered into a voluntary union and confederacy
with the national troops at Douay. And thus
the hopes of the royal party are diniinifliinz in
every quarter ! Â°
The best opinion amongst the principal mer
chants concerned in the Spanish trade here is
that if we demaitd of the court of Spain a res'
titution of our (hipping and a partial trade to
the south well coiflt, both will be granted; but
if we demand an exclofive general trade it
would be in fact giving np the keys of Mexico
and Pern, and for the preservation of those
places they will rifqoe every thing.
The speculative politicians, who look to our
quondam polleflions in America, for afliftance at
the prefentcrifis, will be deceived, if we arc to
trull to the best informed men from that country.
They look on European differences with too

having been forwarded to the general at Port
au-Prince, the popular impatience arose to such
an unbounded height, that they seized on the ex
press, brought him back, and opened the dis
patches in public, which, on being read, produ.
ced the u tin oft fatisfaition ; containing inflruc

PHILADELPHIA, 24.
The crops of wheat and rye in every part of
Pennsylvania, have greatly exceeded the expevft
ations o! the farmer. While those grains had
an unpromising appearance last spring, a quad
luple quantity of Indian corn, oats and potatoes,
were put in the ground, all of which promise an
miineiile encreafe, so that the profits of agricul
tuie to the State of Pennlylvania, it is computed,
this fall and next spring, will be equal, if not
fupeiior to what they have been during the last
I he Princes of antiquity, and particularly the
Roman Emperors, had recourse to the expedient
of deification, in order to inspire into the minds
of the people reverence for their persons, and
absolute fubmilfion to their extravagancies.âThe
jus divinum and fan&ity of character, which some
of our modern monarchs have afliimed, are co
pies of this original absurdity, and calculated
011 (imilar principles of policy, to enslave the
mind, and divest human nature of tliofe rights
and privileges communicated, by supreme pow
er, to elevate man above the reft of the
creation ; but the people have dece<sted the im
posture, and regained that rational station in so
ciety, which their fathers had impotently re
signed to the iniquity and caprice of monarchs
for several thousand years.
tor the information of the public, a corres
pondent has favored us with an account of the
cause of the difturbanres in Hifpaniola, which he
collected from his letters, and intelligence recei
ved of persons from that island :
Sometime ago, the citizens of the island aflem
bled, and chose delegates from each diftricft, to
meet at St. Mark's in aflembly, with authority
to make laws for the government of the island.
1 hey met, and made a number of lawsâthese
laws were approved of by the inhabitants of the
north, and disapproved of by the south fideofthe
liland ; but the Aflembly attempted to enforce
them, and enliftened all the King's troops, at
eig t dollars per month, and a bit a day wages :
u' ZC i . U P O . n a f renc '' 74 gun-lhip, and a frigate
â nc ] J ?y in the harbour, and manned them: â
they alio enrolled all the inhabitants of the north,
and draft them by terms. Any pei foil who is
.in- i i a,K ' not turn out 10 e "fÂ° rce Â£ h e
nuembly's laws, i* p u t into confinement. Any
per son drafted is free from arrell for debt while
in service, or in going to or coming from head
quarters, or for fifteen days after their return.
!n consequence of this law, a number of people
have purchased goods from merchants and maÂ»
teis of vefiels, and taken protection by joining
the troops. >The inhabitants of the foutli armed and aiTeM
bled themselves in great bodies, and were prepa
ring to attack St. Mark's ; they had got a frigate
and some other veflels of force with troops on
boird, whichfailed on the jdinft. for St. Mark's,
to endeavour todifperfe theAflembly and troops.
Extratl of a letter from Cape-Francois, August 6.
" We have now a civil war throughout this
Aland : citizens are fighting against citizens, and
trade is entirely at a Hand, and unfafe : it is a
very critical time, and very dangerous to have
debts out. Produce has got exceeding high and
scarce ; a great part of the people's time is taken
lip with the present difturbances,fo that they can
not attend to the Molalles is not got
at any price."

IROM THE POUGHKEEPSIE JOURNAL.
r | second session of Congress is now closed, and when wc
A confidcr the fubje&s which have been under difcuflion and
the decisions which have been made upon them, I consider it as
concluding under circumstances not inauspicious to the interest and
honor of the United States. The question of the removal, intro
duced as it was, in the midst of the most important business, ap
peared to be below the dignity of the government. It has howe
ver terminated #11 fuither uneasiness on the fubje6t, and if an im
mediate removal has too much the air of levity and local politics,
yet a more central situation for the permanent rcfidence was un
doubtedly a just proportion. Complaints have frequently been
wiadc at the* 'ength and slowness of the proceedings of Congress;
but the persons who make them, have taot properly refle&ed on
the difficulty and importance of the business they have had before
them. Qurftions ariftng on public revenues and credit are the most
intricate m the science of and they were peculiarly dif
fituU wi h us f-om the long unsettled condition cf our public
funds, and tiie various claims and various opinions that have been
founded upon thnn. The report of the Secretary of the Treasury
firft brought up to view solid principles in the settlement of the
Bui lie credit, and is no doubt the ablest production that has ever
be n 'produced in this country on the fubjett of Finance. This
report has been difcuffed> and its principles investigated for feve
fal monthsâthe anxiety of the public has been greatâ-its expecta
tions have been raised and repeatedly disappointed, till at length
the business has terminated, if not entirely to every one's wishes,
yet in a manner very latisfa&ory to the community and honorable
to the government. The national debt is fundedâa considerable
portion of the state debts afTumed and funded also, and provision
made by law not only for redeeming and finking the public debt,
but for a final fcttlement of accounts between the individual Rates
and the union. ThiÂ» business alone so immensely important to the
lrfcreft and welfare of QUr country, is in my judgment cheaply
accompliftied by fix months of debate and deliberation. I could
havr trlhrd the public circumstances had admitted some things te
have been more fully done, which are now limited by the proba
ble neccflities A the union. A more ftrift adherence to principles
would have required the whole of the state debts to be afTumed
and not a pait onlyâthe interest of the national debt to have been
funded on like terms with the principal, and not at three percent,;
and the whole debt to have been immediately funded at an inter
est of fix per cent, and not a third part postponed for ten yeais.
However when I rcfleft on the vast difficulties and opposition that
Congrefo had to contend with, and the various jealousies and pre
judices which have started up, I cheerfully ac<|uiefce, and with
fenfationsof pride and gratitude in the measures which have been
adopted. I consider them as measures of great and wife and neces
sary national policy, and which will contribute, almost as much
as the late revolution in the government, to consolidate our union,
and replace our public character, on the permanent foundations of
inrertft and jufticc
â¢The great objefls which were ncceffary to make us a free and
refpedlable nation seem now to be nearly attained. Next to a
well armed and well balanced government for the United States,
was the funding and gradual redu&ionof the public debt, and the
settlement of the claims of the several states. One of the last a&s
of Congrrfs was to provide means for the final adjustment of the
aecouuts between the individual ftaies and the union. The pre
sent generation have done in a few yeafs the work of a century.
We have accomplished our freedom, our reputation, our union.
No people have more deeply studied and more happily seized the
true principles of government. No people can frame or reform
their conftitutiona as successive experience may di&ate ; or restore
an d fix their public credit, as the national exigencies may require,
with more cooliefs, harmony and dispatch. Personal, political
and religious frtedom, seem to have attained their last stage of per
fection and fecuiity in America,. The spirit of freedom has in
deed exlfted in a)I ages; :t has often ihown out with a brilliant
Juftreâbut its splendor and hippy efFeÂ£ta, have been but moment
ary, and have perished under forms of government illy constituted,
and fubjeft to perpetual vibration. It is impossible to fay how
far improvements may still be made in the great science of render
politics subservient to the happiness of mankind. It has been
rcferved to the people of this country to present the best image
vjhirh has hitherto appeared in civil biftory of a wifely and
ly balanced republican government; or a government which will
ensure the most equal and beneficent adminillration. Our pro
gress in political knowledge appears the more ftrrking when we
Â«bferve tne conduct of tlie French nation, a nation celebrated for
quicknc'tof conception. They seem to be inattentive to the ripe
f i uits of experience which they might gather from the history of
all nations, and which have been so deeply and elaborately difplay
rd by Doctor Adams in his defence of the Ameiican Conftituti
ona, and to be running with intemperate ardor after democracy.
It is impossible to tell what will be the result of their revolution.
I will however venture to aflert that there is more found sense and
found knowledge of government displayed by an anonymous wri
ter in the Gazette of the United Slates in his Discourses on Da
yila,"than in all the deliberations of the French National Aflembly.
) may be thought too warm in my reflections on the genius and
felicity of America. It suits fometempers to be constantly view
ing and exaggerating the dark fide of public and private life. I
confefs I find more consolation and pleasure in the opposite pic
ture, and in viewing what is honorable and advantageous to my
country. It at least serves to render us more cheerful and con
tented in our own private walksâit gives us as patriots a certain
pride and elevation of fentimenf, anei as men of serious and de
vout affe&ions, it serves to fill our minds with gratitude and love,
and from the view of private and political bleflings, to raise our
thoughts to that being who is the great Author of tbofe bleflings
and Father of mercies
NEW-YORK, AUGUST 28.
'T'HE Gattttes of the fuverai Sutcs of the month of June last,
informed the public, that a man, who called himfelf Ar
chibald Ross, and palled through Petersburg, in Virginia, gave
out that about livte yeirs ago, being on board a called the
Julius Co/at-, commanded by Capt. Squires, belonging to Phi
ladelphia, and on her way from Charleiion toâ¬adi2, the faÂ«d (hip
was taken off the Weftem Islands by two Algcrine and car
ried to Algiers ; that himfelf and tWeoty-one others, hiscompan
10ns, whose names he pretends to recite, were condemned to Aa
very, of whom himfelf and fix others, at length elcaped to Gib
raltar; that from some Post of Spain Ire the fai& Archibald Rofs,
a " Archibald Deacon, got a passage to Boston, where he left
the said Deacon,and was proceeding through PcterfburgtoCharlef
ton, where he said his friends reftded-. He pretended also to
havefeena Mr. Henry Whiting in slavery among the Algerincs.
Government being in pofleflloti of evidence that there are no other
American captives in the Barbary States but fifteen, who are of
taken in the year 1785, in the (hip Dauphin, Obrian, and
schooner Maria, Stephens, immediately took measures for enquir
ing into such of the fa&s ftatcd by Archibald Rofs, as were with
in their reach. They are informed from Philadelphia, on an offi
cial examination of the entries for fix years back, that no such
fliip as the Julius Casfar, commanded by Captain Squires, has be
longed to that port within that period ; from Charleftort on an ex
amination of eight years, that no Tuch Ihip has cleared out there
within that period, and from Bodon*) that but one veflfel has
arrived tilet'e which had failed froth any poit ol Spain within
the perioaof the pretended efcapc of R'ofs, the maftrr of which,
on examination, declared that while in Spain he heard nothing
of this matter, and that no such pafTmger as Archibald Deacon
came with him. The information from Charleston is further,
that the pretended Archibald Rofs has not made tys appearance
there.
Attention was paid to this impofler, because he furnifhed mat
ter for his own dete&ion ; and because repeated inftanefs give
reason to apprehend that it is becoming habitual with Vagrant ad
venturers to fublift themfclves on good and unguarded citizens,
by persuading them that their brothers, children, or hulbands,
long since loft at fca, are now living in Algiers, where they pre
tend to have seen them in captivity, thus nourishing their own
profligacy in the fluicea of diflrefs, which they cruelly re*open in
breafls where time had closed them. A humane people will cer
tainly discourage this flagitious abuse of their best paflions, by
treating as swindlers and divulgers of falfe news, those who shall
be found dealing out talcs as improbable as they are cruel.
#3" The Printers of the several Gazettes in different parts of
the United States are desired to insert the above.
TOUR TO RHODE-ISLAND.
The late excursion of The President of the United States to
the State of Rhode-Island, is one of those events which makes the
deepelk and most pleasing impreflions on the public mind : The
people of that State had long wished for an opportunity toexprefs
their feelings, personally, to 11 the mam who unites ail hearts."
RECEPTION AT NEWPORT.
The Prcfidcnt arrived at Newport on Tuesday 17th inft. where he
was received with the highest demonftrationfcof joy : An elegant en
tertainment was provided in the Rcprefentatives' chamberâwhich
was emblematically dfcorated on the oecafion : Addrefles were
prelented from the Rev. Clergv, and'the Society of Free Masons.
After viewing the town, on WcdnefdaV he was escorted by a
large and refpe&able committee, attended by a proceflion of the
citizens to the Packet, and embarked for
PROVIDENCE,
At which place he arrived the fame day at 4 o'clock, P. M.â
A proceflion was formed agreeable to * previous
which escorted him to his lodgings at rifr.'Dagget'S tavern.
The attendance of almoll every inhabitant, both of Newport
and Providence in the proceflions, together with a brilliant ap
pearance of ladies at the windows and doors of the houses, evin
ced, in the mod sensible manner, their pleasure on this happy, oc
calion.
In the evening the College Edifice was fplcndidly illuminated.
Federal Salutes were fired at Newport, and at Providence, on
The President's landing and embarkingâand the bells rang a joy
ful peal: Addrefles were prelented by the town of Providence,
the Corporation of the College, and the Society of the Cincinnati.
After partaking of an entertainment at the Court House in Pro
vidence, where the federal circle of patriotic toads were drank,
accompanied by discharges from the artillery, The President, his
Suite and the Gentlemen who accompanied him from this city,
embarked on their return.
FURTHER EUROPEAN INTELLIGENCE.
Accounts from Bruffel* inform, that the people of Brabant flock
in great numbers to that cityâlo,ooo entered in one morning, to
pay their homage to the new government; but great alarms and
confufion still prevail in that In consequence of the present
critical situation of Affairs, the Hague Gazette has been lufpen
ded for fix weeks.
Alarming accounts are received at Paris daily of the diford.rs
which pir vail in the army, moll of the regiments being no longer
under fubjettion, they revolt, diiband, and are in such a state of
infurre&ion, as renders it impoflible to calculate the refill t; in con
sequence of this the King has proposed uniting the national troops
with the regulars ; this proportion was joyfully received by the
National AlTembly. The King and all the Royal Family are at
St. Cloud to pass the summer. His removal from Paris caused
some uneasiness, and an inflammatory pamphlet was wrote on the
occasion, in which it was said there was a conspiracy on foot, and
that the king was to be carried off ; this excited a great fermen
tation, but it did not prevent the King from going the next day.
The King of Sweden has pardoned the officers, whose sanguinary
sentences are mentioned in this Gazette, No. 35. The prince of
Naflau, commanding a fleet in the Ruffian service, has been defea
ted by the King of Sweden in person.

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
SATURDAY,JuIy 24.
ptbalt on the amendment of the Senate to the Fund
ingÃÃUtI t to ajfuMe a part of the State Debts.
M*. GERRY
THE gentleman has told us of ihe exertions of Georgia, that
by Oie assumption injustice will be done to her, and that
ber'S, in particular will be a hard cafe. I have no douut the ci
tlzefcs of that State, accordirig to their abilities, made great exer
tion* ; they behaved with,valor, and have fuffeied much in the
common pause ; and if there are any circumftantes which will
fobjeft hefto an injury by the operation of any aÂ£h of Congress,
1m Her dale them, and the will undoubtedly obtain redress, r
think I can be relpoqfible for MalTaehuletts, that her members
*ill do every thing that is.coafiftent wiih j'llUce, and even with
((tnerofity for Georgia. But the gentleman Ihould consider, that
Georgia is but an infant State, that by her uimoft exertions (he
could uot contribute 111 any great degreÂ« to accomplish this revo
lution, apd (he cannpt ex pert that the measures of thus extensive
itpriblic wilt be entirely accommodated to her (ituaiion.
The gentleman tell us, thai whiift pollou was in pollcflion of
the enemy, made great exertions and fufferid much,
but not afterwards, for her ports being opened and commerce
ilourilhing, (he was enriched by the war. [//cre Mr. Jackson ex
plained kimjitf, and Hi lot deny that Mjjf.ichUjells continued her ex-
C'tioni, but Juppofed, neverlhcleft, Jhe was enriilud by the war.] Mr
(jerry admitted the explanation, and tequefted him to give any
information he pleased refpefiing his argumects, as it was intend
ed to consider them candidly.âHe then proceeded : I conceive,
fir, the gentleman is very little acquainted with the history of
MalTachufetts, as it relates to this fubjeft, for so far was the State
from being benefited, that it fuffered exceedingly by the war.
To judge of this matter, let us further examine the reports which
wire formerly called for to alcrruirt the contributionsof the Statis,
and fee whether they will juftify the fuppofuion that the State
was benefited by the war.
If we refer to the report of the Secretary at War to ascertain
<te number of men furniflied by tfee fevcral States, we IHall find
(fiat some troops were inliited for the war, some for three years,
some for two, and others for one, and the militia for less periods,
ki order, then, to form ajuft idta of the comparative exertions
qf the Slates in mij refperf, it is necessary to reduce the number
of njen to one period of inliftment, whether inlided for a longer
or (horier time. For instance, to consider fix soldiers, who
T<>ere enli/lei for two moriins as being equal to one inlifttd lor a
ypir j or, if they were inlHted for three years, consider otie as
eqijal to three for one year.
By the Secretary's report, it will thus appear, that the whole
dumber o'f men employed duriug the war, reduced to one year's
term of ftrvice, was 311,719. Of this numbtr, Mairachufeits,
hy the average of the rcquifitions on her, was required to furnilh
toe enormpus proportion of 93-508 being 57,066 men, which is
between a fifth and flxth of the whole number employed during
tKe; war, aliho' her proportion was not more than a seventh.
What was her conduct on this occalion ? oid Ihe fail to turmih
the number required ? No, (Vr, (he raised the whole, and what
is still more extraordinary, (he lupplied above the requifiuons
17,140 men; if to this number we add 12.535 men which Ihe
lupplied bgrteably to the and wn ,c 1| exceeded her jull
proportion of one seventh, it appears that (lie furnilhed Â£9,675
men (for the term of one year's'fervice) above her proportion.
Had the State in lieu of 74,206 inch which (he thus fupplitd,
raised only her due proportion, which wis 44.531, the probabi
lity is, (he would have obtained these for half ol the average boun
ty which she paid for them, and have saved at Icaft 1,005,128 dol
lars.
Let us how consider the c(Te& of this nwafure, and judge of the
benefits resulting to the State by the war. The amount of the
specie claims ot the State for pay, depreciation of pay, bounties,
and cloatfiing for all"the troops wh'.oh Malfcichufetts lurnilhcd is
8,006,553 dollars atÂ»d this averaged on 74,206 men, will for

about,
Nine years interest due on this sum, is about
The Irtcreafed bomuics on her proport-on from the
eaufes Mentioned
And if to these be added the loss of the Slate
by the absence of Â£9,675 men the (Upplif* given to
them from time to time; the lolTrs fuitained by the
death of perhaps a quarter part of them the fupp rt
of the widows, and fatherlofc Children, the amount,
3t the moderate rate of 100 dollars for each Foldicr,
will be
Miking 8 >9 3 3i43 6
whieh thai State has taxed heffelf to furnifh for other States their
dehcicnccs bf floods, and the last film mentioned 2,967.560 dol
lars will be wholly 1 oil to the State, in addition to thus, lever*!
regiments wefre recrnittd in the State, not contained in the pre
ceding estimateâMuch has been said of thf extravagant bounties,
given by MiHfachufv-Hts, the cSufe of which Is explained, and not
withstanding the cxthaorainafy rc(|ui(iiious on her kit men, the
average bounty paid by her, during the war for the term of a
year's serVice, has hot txcecded 47-2 dollars fofreach soldier.
Let us riow turn oar attention for a moment to the report of the
Secretary bf the Tfbafury wliith contains an account of the rcccipts
and payments of the States, in specie ami indents, dnri in
paper money red 11 *cd to fofceit. It is readily admitted, that the
paper money in forric inftafices is extended at a raie tif deprecia
tion, less than that which will be finally adapted, but by recur
ring to the report, I think it Will b"e evident that the fcomp3rative
view of this matter in its pieftnt form, is It fs favotable to Mas-
than it will be when the depreciation is fuViher extend
edâas the accounts now prell-iit themselves, the amount ot the
sums received jnto the trcafury from the several State* is 14,200,777
dollars, reduced to fp'ccie value ; the sum paid from the treasury,
to the several States amounts to 10,672,770 dollars, so that the
ballance of rcceipt?, at the Treasury is, 3,528,003 dollars ; of this
sum Maflrfchpfctts turnifbed, exclusive of what fhc re'ceiverl from
the Treasury, 1,921,283 dollars, which is nearly 4-7 of the bal
ance of all the rccoipts at the TreasUry, from the States, to this
day. Her proportion of the ballaricc mentioned of 3.5 8,003
being one seventh, is 504,000 ; Co thai lhe has supplied in
this instance, 1,417,283 doliari, reduced to specie, above her pro
portion. By the dbove ftaiemenls irtaHe from authentic docu
ments on tiiC files of Che Houfc, it is evident that MafTachufctts
iias advauced for ot'.icr State*, fioliars.

And from hence we may foran fonipjudgment oi the benefits
has received from the war, Which has almost impovenlhed and
ruined her.
If we advert to the proposition of the Senate, for * the
State debts, we lhall find the whole sum to be ailumied is 21,500.060
dollars, and that MalTachufctts, if she liad not advanced more
than other States on an average, would bt; entitled to 3,071,428
dollars, being a seventh of the sum to be alTumed. She is to re--
ceive thereof four millions dollars, io that lor all her advances, fhÂ«
will be teimburfed by the atlumption only, 928,572 d6 l lars and
yet this paltry sum compared with her demands is grudged by
Sjatcs, for whom, she has made such large advances.
LONDON, June 7.
Er.traci of d letter jroht Naples, April 22.
ON the 4th inft. early in the morning, a fire
broke out ill the Ruggiero,a 74 gun ship be
longing to the royal navy, in the port of Caltel
laniare; as soon as the fire was discovered at Na
ples, all the workmen at the arsenal, without ha
ving received any orders, went on horfebackand
in carriages to contribute their afiiftante. It is
remarkable to their honor, that this was Easter
time, when the workmen generally clioofe to
spend their time with their wives and lamilies.
The fire, inlpite of' every resistance, ahnoft con
sumed the above ship to the water's edge, and
had communicated to another veflel laden with
corn, and from that to another of the King's
/hips of 75 guns. In the midst of this conllerna
tion, and when the whole dockyard was in dan
ger, a young workman of the arsenal of Caltella
mare, observed that fufficient assistance was not
given to the second veflel on fire ; with amazing
courage and spirit he threw himfelf into the sea,
and Iwam to the Ihip, ilript himlelf in the niidit
of the flames, and tried to extinguish thein. His
example inspired his companions with courage,
and by their spirited efforts, all the fliips in the
harbor, except the Ruggieroand the corn veflel,
were saved. The king, when informed of the
zeal and bravery of thole men, ordered that all
those who had come at their own expenceto Caf
tellamare, should be recompensed, the
young man who had so bravely hazarded his life;
but not one man would accept of the recompense ; re
filling it in the handlbmeit terms.
" The Neapolitans have voted agratuity to the
king of 2,a 50,000, and the Sicilians 900,000 livres
tournois, to make up the loss the marine has fuf
fered by the deftrmftion of the Ruggiero. The
king has ordered General d'Aiflion to express his
fatisfa&ion with this mark of their loyalty and
affe&ioii."
BRABANT AND FLANDERS.
It is very difficult to procure any authentic in
telligence of theaffcirs of Brabant at present. No
person there dare write with any freedom, for
fear of their letters falling into the hands of those
who watch to detedt spies, and who are ready to
construe every kind of intelligence, as given from
some improper motive.
A plan was lately concerted at Cotirtray, and
that neighbourhood, supposed to have been plan
ned UnderAuftriau influence,the purpose of which
was, with a force of 1 j,ooo men, to release Gene
ral Vandermerfch from the Citadel of Antwerp,
and to conduct him to Flanders, to be tried by
the provincial council.
The attempt, however, failed, owing, as it is
believed, to I'onit of the chief people concerned,
having at the time they pretended to join in this
plot, been absolutely in the pay of the Patriots.
The ltates of Brabant, in the mean time, have
removed M. Vandermerfch, from the Citadel of
Antwerp to a convent in Louvain, where they
think he will be more out of the reach of thole
who wish to rescue him.
1,005,128
The discovery of this plot occasioned suspicion
to fall on many people at Bruflels ; a general
search therefore, took place, when in different
houses they discovered deposits of arms and am
munition, for the use of the force intended for
the refcuc of Vandermerfch.
2,967.500
In confeuuence of this, about 150 people hare
been seized and thrown into prison and it is
even afl'erted that two or three of them were han <r
ed up by the mob.
PAHIS, June 7.
Oil Thursday [Corpus Chrifti-Bay] his
majesty, accompanied by the queen and the
reit ot the royal family, walked in proceflion
to St. Germain l'Auxerrois, his parish, from the
Thuilleries, through the Rue St. HoÂ»ore, to the
Louvre, and thence returned,by a different route,
to the palace. On his right was the prefide;it of
the national aflembly (M.Treilhard) and 011 his
left the great almoner of France, cardinal de La
val Montmorency. This ceremony had noc its
accuftonied brilliancy, from the absence of so ma
ny of the princes of the blood, and the total abo
lition of all diftindion of orders. The queen
was drefled with an elegant simplicity that by no
means obfeured, if it did not heighten, her natu
ral charms, which, even her enemies allow are
ot the firlt class ; and she Vvas received by an in
credible number of people with every polfible
markoi: attachment and respect.
