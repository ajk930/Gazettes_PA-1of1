THE King oÂ£ Navarre, in examining the dis
positions of the Court, had obfci red that all
those who were employed by the government,
f.uisfied with the prefentfituation of affairs, trou
bled themselves very little about the pretentions
of the Princes of thebloodâand that tliole who
had an interest to desire his grandeur, and that
of his brother, either intimidated by the power
of their enemies, or disconcerted by his extreme
delays, despaired equally of the success of his
enterprise. He returned therefore easily to his
firft design of recovering his states, and judged
tiiat he ought not to let flip an opportunity so
favourable for renewing the negotiations of ac
commodation with the crown of Spain, and of
quitting decently a court, where he could no lon
ger remain with honor. He accepted cheafully
the commifTion of conducing the young Queen
into Spain. The Queen-mother continued to de
lude him with magnificent hopes, and in fpight
of the discontent of the other Princes of his par
ty, he pressed his departure with as much ardor,
as even his enemies could have delired. He fuf.
fered himfelf to be duped in Spain with the lame
facility. The Queen-mothsr had already in
formed Philip the second, of all this manoeuvre.
This Monarch who delired, equally with her, to
fee humiliated and excluded from the govern
ment, the King of Navarre, so ardent to make
good his pretensions to some part of his domi
nions, inftrufted the duke of Alva, and the
other grandees who were to receive the Queen
his consort, not to reje& the propositions of this
Prince, but to lead him 011 and amuse him, by
receiving them seriously, and offering to make
report of them to his Catholic Majesty, and the
council of Spain, without vrhofe advice they could
not determine any affair of state. As soon as the
Kins* of Navarre was arrived oÂ» thÂ»
and had presented the Queen Elizabeth to the
Spanish Lords, he began to speak to them of his
interests, and thought himfelf sure at firft of suc
cess. The Spaniards conduced the negotiation,
with an address which served to nourish his hopes,
at the fame time that they let him know that the
effect could not be immediate. They engaged
him even to fend ainbafladors to Madrid, so that
solely occupied with his firft designs, he retired
to Beam, fully resolved not to meddle in the af
fairs of France, whose"negotiation appeared in
effectual, and the proje<fl of arms as dangerous,
as they were dishonorable.
The Princ? of Condc liis brother, had opposite
vievs, and took very different resolutions. His
fortune was not cummenlurate with his courage,
nor with the extent of his designs. Excited by
themediocrity of his circumstances, by the ha
tred which he bore to the Guises, and incessantly
ftiirulatedby his mother-in-law and his wife,one
thefifter and the other the niece of the Constable,
boti devoured by ambition, he openly detefled
the government of the Queen-mother and the
Guifei. All his thoughts and a&ions tended to a
revolution. He figured to himfelf, that if the
war (houldbe enkindled by his intrigues and for
hit interests, not only he would become the
chief of a numerous party,but moreover he would
procure to himfelf riches, advantages, and per
haps the sovereignty of several cities and provinc
es of the Kingdom. Full of these high ideas he
assembled again at La Ferte, an estate of his inhe
ritance, situated 011 the frontiers of Champaine,
the Princes of his blood, and the principal lords
of his party, and harrangaed them in this man
ner. "In vain, have we hitherto employed the
means of delicacy and moderation. It is not
hereafter but by the mod vigorous efforts that
â¢we can prevent the ruin of the royal family, and
of all those who have not been able to resolve to
cringe servilely under the tyranny of the Qvieen
*iother and the Guises. It is no longer seasona
ble to outrages of which no man can
be ignorant, and which we have fuffered with too
much patience. We are banished from court,
and the government of Picardy, and the office of
frand-mafter is taken from us. Finances, offices,
ignities, are the prey of foreigners and perfon'-
unknown, who hold the King in captivity. Tlu
truth never reaches the throne. The befl parr

THE TABLET. No. 140.
" There it nothing more certain than that name>
alone set a price upon things with those people who
have not judgmevt to know their real value."
I HARDLY know whether the names l?y which
things are called, or the appearances they
aflume, furnilh the most common l'ource of delu
sion. To confer a splendid title upon any objetft,
will awaken emotions of adrtiiratiop in all per
sons who have not taught themselves to be unin
fluenced by the fafcinalion of words. It is un
lucky for tliofe who are fond of deceiving or be
ing deceived by the glare of expreflions, that ex
perience should so frequently remove the inafk
from artificial characters, and dissipate the gay
phantoms that play around the imagination, and
infufe vigor into all our sensations. The reader
will not be surprized that I express myfelf with
some ardor on this fnbjetft, when I let him into a
secret which has been hidden from him, merely
by a propensity to take delight in names that de
note alluring images, and to be astonished with
founds that convey ideas of magnificence. I be
lieve every person who is much acquainted with
what pafles in this part of the world, has at least
heard of Colonel Charles Admirabilis. â
This gentleman resides at his eitate in the coun
try, which is rather too remote from the metro
polis, to make it conienient to travel from one
to the other, in a lingle day. This is a circum
stance that I very much regret, because the citi
zens fcem to have an ardent curiolity to visit this
estate, which the Colonel himl'elf has long called
by the name of the happy retreat. To abate a lit
tle the ardor any one may feel in favor of this
delightful spot, I know of no better way than for
him to obtain a just description of it.
The Colonel and myfelf had been long and in
timately acquainted, before I found it convenient
ro spare so much time as I thought requifire to do
justice to this happy retreat, by taking a full view
of all'he charming Â«bjetfsit contains. For this
reason 1 checked my impatience to fee it at all,
till I had leisure to attend to all its beanties, and
examine it under all itsafpetfs. 1 mull freely
confefs that I have found my taste congenial
with that of the Colonel, whenever he has been'
describing the various allurements that should
tempt meÂ°to pay him a visit. Though he did not
fpecifically point out any elegant traits ofarchi
tenure in his mansion, there was, nevertheless,
569
not a room in it, on which he did not confer foine
fafcinating title. His parlour went by the name
of Prcfpeft-Hall-. His dining room, which lay back
of the hall, was denominated the ft/live tower, on
account of a little vine that spread over one of
the windows. But 1 was moftof all delighted to
hear his library room called the attic retirement.
Theie was not, in fad:, any cornet* of the honle,
which bad not become remarkable by its name.
In like manner, all the appendages were digni
fied with appellations that , denote superior ele
vation or refinement. The Colonel had not left
than a dozen horses, to which he had given Dames,
the l;aft honorary of which was I mull
not forget to mention that he called his choicest
wine the vintal eijtnce. Were I to run over all
the particulars I had heard of the happy retreat,
the reader would not have patience to one
half of them ; but I cannot omit to observe that
thefc descriptions bad wrought me into a pitch
of enthudafm, I had never before felt. There is
nothing remarkable, therefore, in my being on
able to refill the temptation of accepting aninvi
tation to pass a few days with Colonel Ad.mi
rabilis.
Finding myfelffbfituated the beginning of Ju
ly last, that I could spare a week or two for a*
mufement, I haftned as fact as I could to regale
niyfelf with the vintal ejfence. I arrived at the
enchanting habitation of my friend about ten o.'
-clock in the morning, the second day of my de
parture from home. As I made no enquiry for
levered miles before my arrival at the magic fpor,
what diflance 1 had to travel, 1 adtually came up
on it, while I yet fufpecled I was not near it. I
was riding palt at the rate of fix miles an hour,
but the Colonel happening to espy me, called to
me and I flopped. The voice was familiar to ine,
and looking about I saw my good friend fland
ingin the front of an house, which tinder any
other circumstances I should have thought an or
dinary one. Myfirfl impreflion was, that 1 had
rr.et the Colonel at some neighboring house, and
rhat iie would, in a few minute*, accompany me
to his own. I was on the point of asking him how
far we were from the happy retreat, when heor
deted one of his uepliewS, a young lad, to take
care ofmy horse. It unluckily happened, and I
have never blamed niyfelf so much for a want of
precaution, that I allured my friend I had couie
to makehima I hopeitwill be deem
ed an apology for me, when I mention that I
made this aftiirance before I so much as conjec.
tured I h3d arrived at the spot of destination.
In taking the belt possible view of the country
around me, I must own, there would have been
nothing remarkably attradiive, had I not beeii
Itr.nding in profpeCl hall. As I had travelled that
morning near twenty miles, and moll of the dis
tance after I had breakfafled, my imagination
dwelt more upon the refrefhment I expected to
find in the feflive tower, than upon any landscapes
that could tie formed by looking through the win
dows of the hall. It feemecT however by some
conversation that paffed-between the Colonel and
his lady, that the hour of dining was yet very
remote. I therefore proposed a walk by way of
filling up the cliafm between that time and din
ner. My friend would not permit me to walk,
but ordered two horses, called Frederic and Hec
tor to be saddled. The names of the horses led
me to suppose they were so high-mettled that I
could not fafely wear my spurs. I laid all my
weapons of offence aside, and was only felicitous
that the bridle should be strong enough to check
the impetuous courage of He (tor. I was rather
(urprized at the temerity of the Colonel who durlt
mount Frederic, with a whip in his hand, heavy
enough to knock down an o*. We rode offtlow
\j together and took a survey of the whole estate
in an hour and an half. Before I returned, t
thought HeClor a very harmless animal, and was
well convinced I had taktn an unneceflary pre
caution in pulling off my spurs.
Dinner being ready, I was, for the firft time,
shewn the way into the feflive bower, and as my
appetite rendered the repast delicious, it was of
no importance to examine too critically the size
or elegance of the room. The name of vintal ef
ftnee was futficientto give a peculiar relish to any
liquor that is produced from grapes, and there
fore the Sherry, we were then drinking, had a
much finet flavor, than Madeira would have had
underlets favorable auspices. After dinner I
was admitted into the attic retirement, in which I
was not long detained by an examinatisn of the
books and curioJities which belonged to that
[Whole No. 143.]jMvtnient. It was indeed a relief to me to find
this business so soon over, as 1 was so much fa
tigued that nothing could be more fatisfatfory
toÂ°me than reft. When this is the cafe, one ne
ver regrets that the objects, which are around
him, have few allurements. The matter that
molt of all gave ine anxiety, was, how to get over
my assurances of continuing with my friend
through the week. For however fafcinating may
be the name by which any thing is called, when
Its qualities are faiily known, the mind soon ri
ses out of its deception. Let itbefufficient for the
reader to be told, that I framed an excuse the
next day, by which 1 was disengaged from my
proinife, without exciting a fuf'picibn in the Co
nel, that I thought his lituation less attractive
than its name had induced me to anticipate.
LONDON.
MR Van Eupen,to convince our ministry of the
deplorable state of the Belgic army, and the
necessity of succours to raise its dejected and bro
ken courage, enclosed a copy ot the following
letter from Baron de Schoenfeldt, who com
manded that army oji the 23d of May, when it
was so lhamefully defeated. The letter was .di
rected to the Committee of Congress littiug in
Namur :
" My Lords,
" I was forced, though much against iny will,
to take port at Andoy. The difaffetfted are in
ceflantly publifliing it through the country, th a t
our communication is cutoff on every fide; â
the troops seem to be in a state of coniterna,tion,
but ltill do not murmur.
" The officers are well disposed . to do their
duty ; but they afl'ure me they have very great
apprehenlions that they (hall not be able to keep
the soldiers to thcir's
" I fear their apprphenfions are but to well
;'ounded ; for the troops are so full of the idea
of onr being cut off, that, if at the moment of
my drawing them up, in order of battle prepa
ratory to an engagement, any one should take it
into his head to cry put, "We are.cut off," I
am thoroughly convinced they would instantly,
one and all, throw down their arms and fly.
" I am Â«ff opinion, under these circumstances,
that it would be advifeable to march them toNa
mur, that they may be posted along the JVleufe ;
*nd the more so, as Major de Villers ftarnls in
need of reinforcement.

STOCKHOLM, May iS.
In ourlaft we informed you, that the Duke of
Sudermania had accelerated the departure of the
fleet from Carlfcrone ; with a view to prevent
the failing of the Ruffian fleet, and also to make
an attack on that divilion of it which was at an
chor in the port of Revel. This expedition has
taken place, and the attempt has been effeftecj,
although jiot altogether unfuccefsfully, yet with
much expence to our naval force. Advice had
been received that on the 3d of this month, the
Duke was near the Heights of Hejigo, and on
the 13th, the attack took place. . On that day
the Duke failed the fleet into the entrance of the
port of Revel. The Ruffian fleet at anchor there
consisted of three ships, three deckers, eight o
ther large ships of the line, and frigates.
Besides.a numerous artillery with which these
ships were provided, the external works of the
place werejplanted with cannon and there were
several batteries in the harbor.
On the approach of our fleet, a cannonnading
begun from all quarters ; the Ruflian fleet being
ably supported by the guns belonging to the bat
teries on land; they fuffered however confidera
fely, and we should have entirely disabled them,
andgained a complete vicjory, it during the acti
on a violent florin had not arose, and the wind
changed, which hindered our (hips from,profit
ing by thegunson their lower tiers, and prevent
ed some of them from prcferving or evep form
ing the line. And at the moment the enemy's
ships were almoll totally defeated, the Duke of
Sudermania was under the necessity of retreating.
Our Ibip the Pi idee Charles of 60 guns, after be
ing dilmafted by the fire of the enemy, fell into
their hands. The Kieetftander of 60 guns also
being wrecked, the Duke ordered the men to leave
and let fire to her. The La Valeurrnn onshore,

Soon after midnight, between Monday, and
yesterday, in consequence of the arrival of Mr.

at Trentbam, Stafford/hire ; to Admiral Barring

We have the bed authority tofay that theten

MISS ASSUMPTION.*
THE Wit who baftardiz'd thy name,
And croak'd of fun'ral dirge, Â».
Knew not how Tpotlef! was thy fame,
How soon thou would'ft emerge,
Tho loft in party's foggy night,
With fcarceone glimmering ray ; .
Thy friends have rais'd thee fair antj bright,
To lee a glorious day.
* See Gazette, June 2.
On Sunday last The President of the United States returned to
this city from Rhode-Island : He had a fine pafTage of 24 houis
only : His Excellency Governor Clinton, Mr. Jefferfon; Sepretary
of State, Judge Blair, Gol. Humphreys, Major Jackson, and Mr.
.Nelson, who accompanied The President, rettyned with him.
The long wished for period is at length arrived : Speculation in
the public fecurit'.es has received acheck,*on principles, which alone
are competent to producing f<r desirable an in a way con
sistent with justice, and a due regard to perfortal fight.
As there can be no rational doubt of ]the punÂ£cual payment of
the interest, agreeable to the funding system, every person can
with precision dfeterminethe real valueof his property in the funds;
and every facrifice in future must be voluntary. The value of se
curities no longendepends on opinion.
Happy foroUr country, its funds cannot he affected by those e
vents which cause perpetual flu&ations in the public "paper'of *he
European Spates : Tiie waters of fepar-ation have set us at a moit
favorable distance from the old worldâand the policy of the Uni
ted States will conf)ft in being entirely detached from those views,
hopes and iears which c >nvulfe the Eastern Hemisphere.
Every idea that isconneÂ£feed with the rafourqes of the United
States is fuN of hope; they must rapidly encrcafe with our encreaf
ing population, agriculture, manufactures, and extending com
merce. In proportion as speculation in the funds is diminished,
thecirculation of the precious metals will encrcafe ; the profits
which have been derived from speculation, itke a whirlpool,
have drawn the specie out of its proper cowrieâand left the tiade,
the agriculture, manufactures and mechanic without adequate
fupp'iesof calh ; these lupplics will now revert to their proper
channels, aria thus the funding fyfttm will, mediately, prove a
source of bleifing to ail claffcs of citizcnsâlo those who never
saw a public ferui ity.
The funding system will pr<uluf.c a grciLrevolution in our pru
dential affairsâanc altogetlTPr Tor tlfe Wetttr could uever
have been efFcÂ£lcd but by a change in our national governmentâ
and with innumerable other fcnfible advantages, obvious to every
discerning mind, and readily acknowledged by every candid
citiztu, are a fufHcieot answer to every ilander, or mischievously
intended infinmtion against tjie or the adininiftra
tion thereof.
Rumours rf zvdrs continueâbut neither the Weft-India or Eng
lifti paragraphifts, the journals or log-l>ooks of f.amen, or the
hopes or fears of interested individuals, furniih a Tingle instance
of the Spaniards and English coming to loggerheads :âlt is the '
wish of humanity they never may. The substance of all the ma
rine intelligence on the fubjeft is, that a vessel spoke a veflfel, which
had seen a veiTel,that saw a frigate that run the gauntlet through the
Spanifti fleet. Any person that that can give any account of
the Englifti rm ffengcrto the Court of Spain âor of the Spnnifh
fl< et,or of the English fleet, that has failed on a fecHt expedition
to South America, will please to call on the public.
It is ihrewdly fufpefted by some politicians that there will be
a general war in Europe, by sea and land : They fay universal
phlebotomy is the only remedy for the French influenza, which
is spreading all over the Eastern hemisphereâeven the Pontificate
isinfeftedâCatharine 6f Ruflia has her fears on the fubjeflâ
and this circnmftanCe it is thought has induced her lately to infiil
on terms of pacification that are monstrously extravagant.
The Roman Senate very fuccefsfully employed this artifice for
ages, to keep the people quiet under their oppreflions : When
ever they began to grumble they immediately had their attention
diverted by a quarrel, to support the honor of the Roman name :
thus they forged chains for themselves by conquering their enemies.
The negociation between Spain and Great-Britain, is really a
fubjeft of curious speculation : It appears to be rather like the ne
gociation of a treaty of alliance, ofTenfive and defensive, than re
monftratmg on real or supposed injuries : We hear nothing of ca
tegorical answers. Query, Whether/ the Englifti aristocracy and
the executive do not forebode the French contagion : If the veo
maftry of Great Britain were to let themselves fcrionfly to work,
it is fufpefted that they could conjure up a few grievances.
The donations of the city of Paris to the nation, amount to
40,600,000 livres. A noble offering on the altar of freedom.
On apprehensions of a scarcity of flour ai?d grain, the importa
tion of those articles into Grenada, in Bfilifh bottoms, from fo
reign Weft-India Islands, is permitted by a proclamation of Gov.
Matthews.,
The (loop Experiment, Capt. Boyd, from Albany, has brought
to this port forty hog fheads of maple sugar, made at Cooper's town,
on Otfego Lake : Mr. William Cooper is the proprietor of this val
uable specimenâwhich by a fcertificate in the Albany Register,
(4 *ned by a number of the most refpeclable characters in that quar
ter, ladies and gentlemen, who had used it, is declared to be su
perior to the best Muscovado sugar.
Maple sugar has beeu made in this country more than thirty
years ; but from inexperience, and the badness of the apparatus
used in manufacturing it, it was never contemplated that it could
be brought to its piefent excellent quality : There is no doubt that
it will attain to a much greater degree of perfe&ion.
Phifofophical Reflections on the Revolution in [France, xoill be
continued in our next.

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
SATURDAY, July 24.
Debate on the amendment of the Senate to the Fund
ing Bill, to assume a part of the State Debts.
MR GERRY. I did not expeÂ£t,fir, to be under the neceflity
of rfgain entering into a full difcuflion of this fubjeft; but,
fomcobftrvations which fell yeftcrday from the gentleman from
Georgia (Mr. Jackson) and which have not been answered, re
quire consideration. His motion is to difagrec to the proportion
of the Senate for assuming the State debts ; and either the gentle
man has mistaken the queQion involved in the proportion of the
Senate, or I confefs I have no idea of it. He supposes it is a
question, whether ths United States rtiall charge thcmfelves with
a debt which waa contrasted by the several States for their own
purposes, and in which the Uuited States are do ways concerned;
and whether we (haltahus npon the union a heavy and un
lieceffary burden ? âlf this was the question, I should not for my
part, neither do I believe there is a numbir on the floor Â«vho
would hcfitatea moment to reject it. But the question, as I con
ceive, is, whether the United States fliall pay a debt which they
contra&ed, and promised to pay for the common defence. A
debt which in their distress, they desired the States to
A debt which was thus transferred to the States without their con
sent, or the consent of the creditors, and which has never been
discharged. A debt, which if a suit could be injlitut.d agaioft
the United States, would be recovered in any court of justice or
equity. This, as I conceive, is the nature of the question on the
proportion before us from the Senate. Bnt as tbefe points on a
former occasion have been fully considered, and the fatts relating
to them, well established, a further difcuflion thereof may becbn
fidered as a waste of the time of this house, I (hall at
tend 10 other observations of the gentleman from Georgia.
He fays, that by means of the alfumption, States who have pcid
their own debts will be taxed for the debts of others. And ha*
tiot the gentleman consented to a bill, which this morning has
been pal Ted by the Senate, and which provides, that Stats who
have not paidtheir proportions of the State debts, (hall be charged
with the balances due thereon, whether they have paid their own
debts or not ? Will not this provision tax the deficient States for
debts ol other Statesâ they not, in justice, to be thus taxed,
if their demands arc lets than their proportions of the amount of
the State debts ? Surely, the gentleman has not forgot the provi
iions in this a&, 1 mean the ast for fettling the accounts between
the United States and individual States.âThis provides that every
State ftvall be credited for all its supplies and fcrviccs for common
defence, whether authorrfed or unauthorised, regularly or not
regularly vouched, and whether her debts arc funk or not funk ;
and thole States who have been so fortunate as to pay then own
debts, will receive so much thereof as was contra&rd for the
union, and also the interest thereon : Wnilit on the other hand,
they are to be chargcd tor their proportions of the balances due
td the several Statesâfor all advances made to them refpe&ively
by the United States, and for such part of their debts as we ma)
aflume â and for charging the latter, an express provilion is made
in the bill before us. What further measures tnen can be adopt
ed to do justice to the States, who by their exertions have djf
charged in whole or in part their own debts ?
But let me enquire, Sir, which are the Stales who have made
such vast exertions to fink their debts ? Arc they thofc only who
have opposed the a Sumption ? 1 affirm not, but that the States in
savor-os it have made as great, if not greater progress in finking
their debts, than those who are against it ? Much hzs been said of
the State of MafTachufetts, and let us examine its conduit relative
to the point. If any gentleman will be at the trouble ol com
puting the claims of the several States, as contained in the report
of the commiflioners for fettling the accounts between the United
States and individual States, he will find the aggregate amount,
cxclufive of such as are general and unfpecifi; d claims, to be a
bout 75,172,448 specie dollars ; if we deduct from this sum what
is charged in the books of the Trea'uiy to the several States
being 10,672,770 dollars
the balance will be 64,499,678
If we suppose Maflachufetts chargeable with a icvemh ot this
balance, it will amount to 9,214,239 dollars, which will pro
bably be the extent of its proportion ; the principal of the claim
of that S:ate then being Dols. 14,573,217
If we dedud its proportion of the aggregate bal-
ance
The balance due to the State for the principal of its
claim will be
Add to this at least nine years intercft,
And the whole balance will be 8, 52,826
But (hould we even admit to be added to the aggregate balance
mentioned of 64,429,678 dollars, ten million of dollars for the
general or anfpccifiea claims of several States, the balance due to
Maflachufetts will in that cafe, be for principal about Dal\.
For nine years intcreft,
Making in the whole
By this dale mem it appears, from authentic documents, that
the amount Â©Ithe claims of Malfachufetts, which have been as
regularly kept and are as well vouched as any in the union, and
in moll instances much better, fa Dollars.
For principal ' Â»4>573> 2 *7
For mtereil 2,893,848
Making in the whole 17,467,065
And as the lime for receiving State claims is extended by Con
gress, and there are, as I am informed, additional demands that
are not contained in the accounts exhibited by Maffacbufetts,
which, including interest, will be upwards of one million and an
half of dollars, the claim of that State will not be much ftiort of
nineteen millions of dollars ; and of this turn there being about
five million now owed, it is evident that not much less than four
teen millions of dollars are already funk by that State. Has any
"State in the union rxccededâhas any equalled thele exertions?
Look at the tax bills of that State, and you will find in the year
1783 the enormous sum of / 593,430 9 10, equal to 1,978,101
dollars (including a tax for equahfing bounties) levied in one a& ;
and so high were the taxes at that time, as I am well informed,
that*n eminent merchant, who has since been unfortunate, paid
10001. sterling, and another very refpeftable chara&er in Boston,
paid 15001. fteiiing specie taxes in one year.
These facts arc a specimen of the exertions of Massachusetts,
whose.teal perhaps carried her farther than good policy could
juftify ; for notwithflanding the well known attachment of her
citizens to good government, these burthens were insupportable,
and the coufequence was the event which the gentleman refers to
when he mentions the leaders of the infurccftion. But as some
of the deluded citizens concerned therein were pun'Â»fhcd, and o
ihers pardoned by government, I think a veil Ihould be drawn
over that unhappy affair. The gentleman has enquired whether
the union is indebted to Maflachufetts, North-Carolina and South*
Carolina in the sum of 10,000,000 dollars. I have (hewnjthat it
probably owes to oue of these States the great eft part of this sum,
and there can be no doubt it owes more to all of them.

GO little tuneful tender book !

On fair Narciffa fori distil.
No wild romance above the life

The graceful muse lhall faithful prove,
To nature, hsrmooy and love.
Refined delight the muse shall.bring,
With silent ilep, or easy wing ;
The kindling glow do thou improve,
And wake the youthful fair to love.
Then sing that bands as hearts (hould join,
That kindred fouls alone ihtwinc,
That joys on earth, and blift above,
Are found in elevated love.

And pleai'd oWferve the budded rose.

PHILADELPHIA, August, 20.
Ext rafi of a letter from a refpeflablc citizen tf Edin
burgh, ti a gentleman in this city, dated the 28th of
April, 4790.
" I am sorry to fay, the people of this country,
(Scotland) seem ilill unfriendly to the Americans,
and that the news printers cannot be prevailed
<Â»Â» to copy any thing from your papere. The in
sertion of General Washington's speech tothefe
cond meeting of Congress, cost the friends of
America here, 2jl. llerling. You will observe
by Mr. Pitt's speech that the national revenue is
in a flourifiiing ft. te Confideriiig, however,
that in a revenue of about feventeeu or eighteen
miilious sterling, there is only a furplui of about
nine thousand pound*, I really do not fee any rea
son for fucli pompous and bombastic speeches.
The future profpeifts of increase in the revenue
and prosperity of the nation, is very favourable ;
and, 1 hope, there Mr. Pitt will be a true prophet.
He deserves a great deal of praise : my only ob
jection to him is, that he seems to be no friend
to freedom at home ; as he is known to be to
the establishment of liberty in France. The
French afleinbly isan illuftriousbody ; and many
of the members are men of extraordinary abili
ties. lam sorry to fee so few of the news papers
in Britain friendly to their cause. Liberty, how
Â«ever, seems to be coo firmly fixed, ever to be over
turned by the ariftocratics, or by the Kingly
power.âFrance will, of course, increase rapidly
in trade, and will become a better market than
formerly for American produce.
" I find that the United States are going pret
ty extensively into the planting of cotton, it is
needless for me to tell you, that the feeds of In
dia, or Siam cotton, transplanted and propogat
ed in your country, will enhance the quality of
the cotton wool. I notice, also, what the indus
try of one person is doing, in the planting of mul
berry trees, for die fake of the silk trade.
