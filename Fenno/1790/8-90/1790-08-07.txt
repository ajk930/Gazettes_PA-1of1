/ Scs mains, autour du tione, avec contusion,

THE Guises, in their secret conversations
with the King, inSnuated, that if the Con
itable resided at Court, he would be alluming ;
-would think to ircvent h . Majcfly like an infant,
and ewen ro bjiij him r, "t <l*e ferule and the
rod. They tfunted J.; mt-imat?
tÂ»ni; with the Bourbons, the eternal enemies of a
<;rown, to which they had however long aspired.
Finally, they fuggelted, that he could not con
fide in the Constable, without ejepofing his life,
and the lives of his brothers, to the discretion of
people, whole ambition the Kings his predeces
sors had always dreaded ; and whom they had
everiUelJ in a date of humiliation, and at a dif
tajjrfe from Court. Penetrating geaiius easily in
spires fufpi#i6ns into contratffedminds. Nothing
more was wanting to persuade a weak King, to
leek a pretext, honourably to difinifs the Conlta
ble. As soon as the ceremony of the obsequies
ofHenry lid. was compleated, the King over
whelming him withcarelies, figr.ificd to him,that
not being able, withfutticieÂ«ulignity to acknow
ledge his merit, nor the value of the services
â¢which he had rendered the Kings his ancestors,
he had resolved to difrrharge him from.the cares
and b.irthens of government, too disproportion
ate to his great age : that he would no longer re
quire of hiin, any excessive application to business,
but would reserve him for some occaftons of eclat:
that he ihould always cenfider hiin, not as a fer
\ant and a fubjedt, but as a venerable father :
arid that lie would give him leave to retire,
wherever he saw fit. The Conflable easily com
prehended that this lesion had been taught the
â King, by the Guises, through the mother
and the Queen of Scots : that it would be useless
to reinonltrate : and that it was better to receive
as a recompense, orders, which his refinance
might convert into diftfrare., He thanked rbr
King ; rctomniende 1 to liici his lons Â«V)9TfTS ne
phews, and retired to hiscaltle atChantiliy, ten
leagues from Paris, where, he had more than
once before, supported viciHkudes of fortune 1 .
As soon as the Queen mother and the Guiles,
had banished the Constable, thcy>ftudied to ciif
embarrass rhemfelves of the Prinre de Conde.
It was easy to forefee, that his fiery temper,
and animosity againlt the Guises, would trans
port him to attempt all the means imaginable, to
thangi the farm of government ejt abitfhed.
It may be remarked in this place, that these
expreliions intimate an idea of reformation of
government, and regeneration of nations, like
those which prevail at this time, in France, and
in many other countries after the example of
America. One would conjecture that the Prince
of Conde, had it in contemplation to establish
committees of con-efpondence, to call a conventi
on, or national aflembly ; to deliberate on a ra
tional plan of government, to be adopted by the
nation at large. There are, indeed, in history,
feme traces of a party, who wiftied for a republi
can government, about this time : but unfortu
nately, their ideas of a republic, appear to have
been the fame, with those which prevail too much
at present, in France. Two hundred and fifty
years of experience, have not yet brought the na
tion to advert to the true principles in nature,
npon which government is founded. The Mar
quis ofCondorcet,the friend ofTurgot andÃoche
luucgnjj, so great in geometry, is not more
accurate in the fcijjnce of government, than Eti
eiint de la Boetie, the friend of De Thou and
Montair.e... The fame Â»eformation is wanting
now, that was so necefiary in 1550. Whether a
J'cvereignty in one single aflembly,' eonftituted
hy a double reprefentation,'as the present allein
lily is, would have answered then or will
now, are questions that' hereafter may deserve
consideration. It ended formerly, after an hun
dred years of civil wars, in the simple absolute
monarchy of Louis XlVth. Time inn ft deter
mine whether the continued deliberations and
exertions of the National Aflembly, will finally
obtain a balance in their government. This is
the point, on which their success will turn, if
they fail in this, simple monarchy, or what is
more to be dreaded, simple despotism, after long
struggles will infallibly return. If the wild idea
of annihilating the nobility fliould spread far,
snd be long persisted in, the men of letters and
the National Aflembly, as democratical as they

may think tnemfe'vei, will find no barrier against
detpotiiin. The French, as wall as the Creeks,
at this time our refpeiftable gusfts, and all other
nations, civilized and uncivilized, have their be
loved families, and nothing b -t defpotilra ever
did or ever can prevent them f-om being dijhn
-I'iijhed by the p vplc. These h loved families in
France are the nobility. Five eighths of the

MR. FEX.YO,
I HAVE o!>fcrved, with fains concern, a re
commendation of Mr. Weifltr'j in the Tablet,
No. IJ7, advifingtheexercife of Fencing to be used
people of sedentary employments, students,
&c. Exercises and amufenients in a republican
government, should at least, be rationalâthey
should be virtuousâthey should be, if possible,
ufeful. I Ihould be glad to know in what the
rationale of Fencing consists, or of what use it is ?
Perhaps we will be told it is of use to enable a
man to avenge himfelf when insulted, or defend
himfelf when attacked. But in allgoodgovern
ments the laws are fufÃcieutto proteA all good
citizens. I would therefore recommend students
and perfoni engaged in sedentary employments,
as a substitute for Fencing, to provide themselves
with a few tools of any mechanical branch that
they would phoole, and which would afford some
exercise to the body. No country in the world'
is better calculated for machinery than America,
A student tolerably well versed in Mathematics,
and poflefled of some of the common tools of a
Turner might make some important and ufeful
discoveries in Mechanicsâand be of more use to
his country than the whole race of Fen cert, Cud
gellers, and Prize-Fighters, from the creation of
the World to the days of Noah Webster.
A disposition to ape the follies and absurdities
of Europe has too longprerailed in America ; and
it is to be lamented that the InftruJtors of our
youth should make such a falie eftiniate of things
as toadvife recreations inconsistent with the laws
and constitution of our country, and inimical to
the morals of the people. If our youth learn to
fence, they must wear Avoids; because it is a fol
ly to learn a thing for which they will have 110
use. Thus provided with fivords, they will soon
find an opportunity of reducing their theory to
pra&ice ; either by insulting some other person,
or conceiving theinfelves aff-onted upon the slight
est ofcafion.* Edge tools fli' ild not be putin the
hands of fools or madmen ; hey are only fafe in
the hands of men of jears experience, who
have seen enough of the Wc Ito defpifeits vani
ties ; but mep of this deft -.tion do not desire
them. They ave then o;;I proper in the hands
549
of those v hose profeifion is Warâby futh let them
be worn ; but let us not imitate frame parts ot
Europe, where every Journeyman Barber to bi
met with has, inilead of a Curling; Tongs, a long
Rapier by his fide. How contemptible and ridi
culoqs it is to fee a nation, in profound peace,
with every one his sword to liis iide, as if tbev
were a nation of Ifhmaelites where every man's
hand was raised against the hand of his neigbijai'!

NATIONAL ASSEMBLY.
Saturday, May 22.
THIS day the great question on the right of
making peace and war was finally determin
ed. The molt remarkable speech previous to paf
fingthe decree was that of M. le' Comic deMira
bean, who said, that it was. not merely his opinion,
nor the plan of his decree, that he rose to defend,
but, what was far dearer to hini, his character,
whidh had been fulpecfied as unfriendly to li
berty.
He said, many reports had been circulated to
his prejudice ; but he valued them not In order
to be ufefol, he said, he had feafched for trutL,
and that truth he had fpokeu, at the hazard of
difplealing. He then proceeded to defend his
plan, and replied to the principal objections ilai t
ed by M. Barnnve.
]\J. E-arnave, M. le Marquis de la Fayette, and
lev era! other members, then demanded to be
Iveard, but the majority (of the AfleinHy, think
ing there had been enough of speaking on tilt
fubje<3:, determined to close the debate. And
after a number of plans of decrees had been read ;
the following plan of M. de Mirabeau, amsudjd,
obtained the preference by a great majority.

YESTERDAY, in the House of Commons, a
meflage was received from tlie Lords, that
they will proceed further on the trial of Warren
Hastings, Esq. on Toefday next.
Mr. Secretary Grenville moved that an account
of the number of vellels and their tonnage em
ployed in the Southern Whale Fishery be laid be
fore the house.
â¢ Mr. Fox wished that an account m'ight be added
of the trade to Nootka Sound.
Mr. Grtnville said, he had applied to the per
sons engaged ifi that trade, from whom such in
formation us he could obtain Ibould be laid before
the house. '
Mr. Fox and Mr. Sheridan said, it was extreme
ly nccell'ary to have as coirett an account of this
as could be obtainedâand also to be informed
â whether any fectlcment, and of what nature,was
forming, or intended to be formed 011 the coast.
Mr. Grenville said, he was not yet prepared to
give any information oil either I'ubjett.
The report of the Committee of Supply was
brought up, anil 1 he resolutions' being read,
/lir.. Fp*- said, he u'uderftood the geuei al intent
of the vote of credit .10 l?fc, to provide for the un
certain expences that mult neceiurily be inenr
ed, ftiould the hopes us the country be disappoint
ed, and Spain refufe an amicable accommodation.
Hut he had heard that orders far ah augmentation
of the forces by feu and land were already ill'ued.
If this was true, he saw 110 reason why the elim
inates of tliefe augmentations might not be refer
ed to a Committee of Supplyâa committee of
"Ways and Means voted the money necetfary im
mediatelyâand made provision for paying the
interest of it. No maxim in finance could bet ru
er, than that the means of paying any expence
iliuuld go hand in hand with the expence itfelf.
There was 110 end to the mifchtefs arising from
fpcliding money one year, and providing for the
payment the ntxt. The public also lhoiild know
a: once the extent of any expence, as nearly as
possible, in order to judge of the expediency of
it. The House, therefore, had a right to be in
formed why a vote of credit, without an eflimarc
had been p.eferred to the other mode.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer laid, to have vo
ted estimates in Committee of Supply would
have implied," that the augmentation of the F6l
- was 10 be kept up for the whole yearâand
money mull; have been boirowed, and taxes im
paled to pay the interest, before it was known
certainty that either would be wanted. Al
tUo i: was ti ue that augmentations were already
ordered, these augmentations might nor be com-
anotherâand if the hopes of an fcrriitbble accori- ]
tnedation Ihoald be disappointed, provision might j
be made Iqr the additionalexpence, which would
then becotne neceiiiiry, by as early an application
to Parliament as public convenience woiild admit.
Mr. Fox said, lie ncvertneant to nU'ertthat esti
mates voted under the bare apprehension of war
would be fufticieitt, if war fhotild actually ensue,
but that the augmentations already ordered
tnjght have been voted and provided for in the
regular way.
'The Chancellor of thi Exchequer said, that would
have been to continue, for a whole year, aug
mentations, which, in the event of an amicable
accommodation, might not be wanted for so long
a time, or mightnot even be all made.
The refutations were agreed to.
The House resolved into a committee, and the
Chancellor 1 of the Exchequer, after Hating thea
lnount of the claims given in by the American
Loyalids, the amo:r,u allowed by the Commillion
ers, and the sams already paid, moved
That the film of 22/\,odo\. be granted for further
payments âand t
The sum of ;;,oooi. to make good the lodes
fqftained by cer.ain persons, inhabitants of the
United States of.America.
Some of these, he said, had (attained very hea
â  vy loffj-s by a conduct that entitled them to the
nyunlikentc of f his coumryâand it was found,
oil enquiry, taatttae res Ton why they had not ap
plied in per Jon for conipenfation, v, 4 g, that their
lofles bad dcpi i . ed thtrni of the of leaving
America.' <
These were rhe loaons formoney lie -meant

/â¢.vliofe lofles were eftiinated by the Comniiflioners
at 500.0001. andalfo for some other claims not yet
provided for.
The resolutions were agreed to.
He then moved a mode of conipenfation for

army or the navy u ith itores Or provisions, &c.
For i nch us fufiVred by loflcs of income ai ifing

These resolUtions were also agreed to.
Mr. SKiriJa;: fai-J, lie had :i motion to make,
which he knew not whether he had worded pro
perly.; but the purport of it was, to'obtain in
formation whether the trade to Nooika Sound,
and the fettle merit forming, or intended to be
formed there, was undertaken under the fauui-
on ami authority of Government, or merely as
an enter prize of private perlfons.
The Chancellor of thf Exchequer wished the mo
tion to be portponed till the information promis
ed in his MajeftVs anl'wer to the Address could
belaid before the House. Licerifes to trade to
Nootka Sound had been granted ; and he knew
of 110 authority for tfeat, or any other purpose,
J l)iit such as those liceMes contained.
.ilr.'&heriJ.i/! laid, what the house had now
heard, that the fettlcment was a private enter*
prize, was very material.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer said, whether
the fettlcment was or was not a private enterprize,
there could be no d.nbt that it was incumbent on
the honor of the country to demand fatisfadioii
for any insult or injury offered to its fubjedts,
whether in their pri ate capacity of traders, or
acting under the more immediate famftion of go
vernment.
Air. Sherid in said, if the Right Hon. Gentleman
meant to insinuate that he did not think i he coun
try bound in hdi; Jt *v protect every futjedl from
insult or injury .. M 6 put a conihuiiiion on his
Words which they w*tlls not bear.
The motion was poUponed.

NEIVTORK, AUGUST 4,
On Monday the . 2th ult. there was a violent |
rempeft at Leomihfter, Maflachufetts, attended
with hail w"hich wm of fucli a size, and fell with
such velocity, that the stoutest Indian corn was
beaten into ftired*âvaft quantities of apples
were beaten from tHe tOes ânot only the fruit
but â¢te trees received great injury, the bark be
ing broken from their limbs ; the windows brok
en in the hotifes, and the fences received such
, impreflions, as to Jie discovered at 90 yards dis
tance. Many of the hail (tones were as large as
liens common size was a little more
than an inch in diameter. Twenty four hours
aftei it fell, of it were mcal'ured at the
foot of a hill, and found to be 26 inches deep.
The Saturday following great datnag# was
done by hail at Shrewibury, county of Worcester.
Of all the curfei that can befal a fi;ee_people,
therein none perhaps greater, tfran to be hood
winked and led blind-fold. bjr. demagogues and
State Empirics. ' '
Demagogues will cry up an appeal to the peo
ple, but then it is only when they have previous
ly poisoned their understandingsâwhen the
people are left to the natural freedom of their
own minds, they difcovcr and despise the ravings
of the faiftious. A pragmatical orator told a
great man at Atjftris, that whenever the people
were in their rage, they would certainly tear him
to pieces ; yes, ftys the other, and they will do
the fame to you whenever they are in their wits.

FOR THE GAZETTE OF THE UHIT ED STjtTF,$.
It may bea profitable I'ubject of enquiry, what
i are the principal causes which produce the fub
veriion of free governmentsâluxury, ambition
and avarice, are undoubtedly the three great lead
ing principles ; but the operation of ih'.-fe,
pears in an almolt infinite variety of fornis. F.co
nomy is a darling virtue in a republicâthii finen
leadsto impatience under the necellary expence-,
delay* and procrallinations of popular afleiublicj
and the people, from controlling the tardu.clt
of public measures under the direction of a nume
rous body, with the prompt and rapid move
ments of an energetic executive, are gradually
led to depreciate the former, and unduly to e(ii
mate the latter ; theconlequence is juiily to l;e
dfeaded ; for when the public confidence and rc
fpeift, is transformed from one particular branch
of the government, and centers in another, a
preponderation of influence necefiarily takes
place, which commonly proves paramount to
the barriers of freedom. How far the/e'reflec
tions will apply to the pre fen t situation of ai'Â«
fairs, is left to the profound, penetrating, sagaci
ous, jealqus politicians of the day. One very
obvious reflection obtrudes itfelf, and that is,thac
it isofinfinire importance that all the branches
of the government should harmonize as much,
as polfible j for an indignity offered to one,ftr&cS
' at the vital exiften'ce o{all three.
