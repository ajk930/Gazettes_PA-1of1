4'T WOULD just observe concerning the man
-1 ner-of teaching arithmetic, that boys in ge
neral spend a vast ileal more time and pains to
learn that art, than is neceflary, and do not al
ways learn it, when they have done. Boys can
not learn arithmetic mechanically, as they do
writing : They mail be old enough to unde: ltand
it. If lads are put upon the study of arithmetic
before they are fourteen or fifteen years old, How
will be their progress, and imperfect their at
tainments. The mind must have formed Come
Ikill in combination, before it can be employed
in that study to profit. But boys may acquire a
fufficient knowledge in arithmetic for allthepur
pofes of common life,by applying five or fix weeks
closely to it, under a good infti uctor, and at a
proper age. Instead of this, how often do we fee
boys spend winter after winter in learning a few
of the*moft simple rules of that art, and at last
not be able to reduce a single rule to practice ?
And is it not requisite that females should have
some acquaintance with a. ithiuetic ! A venerable
old man, in grey hairs,and an aged matron, who
cannot keep their own accounts, may justly weep
over a misfortune, for which they are not ant
werable ; but an indifferent fpecftator, who knows
the worth of an education, may view with indig
nation that criminal negligence in men of inter
est, which will render "the fate of posterity not
less unfortunate.
Thus have I hinted at the principal defecftsand
inconveniencies that attend the p<efent mode of
education. lam sensible that, though all I have
said may be coiifefied, yet there is one general
objection to any alteration ; which is, that the
people cannot support more expensive schools.
But in answer to this I would observe, that if they
would venture upon the experiment, they might
support schools with the fame or less expence,
that would be much more advantageous. Eco
nomy may defeat itfelf by being carried to an
extreme. * When calculations are tooclofe, there
may be a favitig in the expenditure, but the ob
ject will not be acconiplifhed; and byattempting to
save too much,all may be loft. Men who are al w.iys
employed in small, trifling business, who pursue
an unlteady course of life ; and who, to use a fa
miliar phrase, are always creeping along l>j the
edges, will never make a head in the world, but
must always remain poor and contemptible. 1:
is just so with schools. People build an honfe,
or rather put up fo/nething that â mill do the turn
.for the present ; they fend fifty, fivy, or seventy
children to one Inftruftor, though this is too
great a number, they own, yet, he must do as
â well as he can : Part of them have booksâfoine
have only pieces of a book which mujt do the turn
for the present ; and some have none'at all, but
these must do as well as they can. The children
cannot be spared, more than two or three days in
a week, to attend school, but when they do go,
they must learn as we/I as they can. A matter is
hired, who perhaps is a vagabond, and if he is
not quite so good as could he wiihed, yet he is
cheap, and people must do as well as they can
these hard times. What is all this but creeping
along by the edges ? What is it but fq'iandering
away money and making a mock of education ?
Dare, my candid readers, to ltep from the bea
ten path ofcuftom and prejudice. Erert schools
npon a different footing, and you will find them
not only more advantageous for your children,
but in the end, much cheaper for yourselves.â
ButeVen upon the fuppofirion that good schools
arc eventually more expensive than had ones, this
should not frighten people, when they reflecft t hat
a good education is the best legacy they can be
queath their children. Thousands ofperfons,
who have grown up to a state of manhood and
found they could fcarcelv read or -.vrite, have
wiflied, fervently wiihed their parents had left
them less eftateand a better education. But there
is one argument of more weight than private ad
vantages, and which ought to make parents more
solicitous to encourage schools. We inhabit a
country evidently formed for a great empire,
where civil and religious liberty have taken up
their abode, and where they will be found, as
longasthey arc found on earth. Jhe only way
topreferve these unimpaired, is to diffule know
ledge among the body of the people. Once re
duce the mass of the people to a state of ignorance
and their bondage is inevitable. We haveltrug
gled through an arduous war to defend our reli
gion and freedom, and let us be vigilant to tui
liifh posterity with the means of defending them.
We fhoukl remember at the fame time, that we
live in a late period of the world, as well as a
glorious or.e, and may we not look forward with

Mr. Oswald,
AT a noted inn upon the road to Reading, I
found two countrymen, who had arrived
nearly at the lame time. After warming them
selves, they began a conversation, which appear
ed to me at once incerefting and diverting. 1
therefore took the firft opportunity of putting it
in writing, as nearly in the words of the parties
as my memory could enable me. If you think i.
will either be ufeful or entertaining to your read
ers, it is at your service. A Traveller.
Andrew. Aye ! three days? Why, how could you
fprre so much time ?
Henry. I was waiting for my waggons ; and it
was such fine fun to hear the speeches, that I could
hardly get away at last.
A. Then you can tell us a great deal of what
they are doing.
H. Why as to thatâl do not know very well
what they are doing; but loii'e of them make
monlhous fine speeches.
A. Well and what do they fay?
H. O ! they do pay one another off so cleverly.
A. Why Henry I suppose that you and I must
put our hands in our pockets and help to pay them
all at last. If they spend their time in paying one
another off in words, we shall be forced to pay all
hands of them in solid coin. But can't you tell
us any thing about the business they were about ?
H. Yesâthe firft day I was there, they were
just finifhingalong dispute about Eleifto.s. They
had been at it all the week before.
A. What about Electors ?
H. Why, whether the people should chufe for
themselves, or find some others to chufe for them.
A. To chufe what'?
H. Why, to chufe Senators, I think they called
them.
A. And why were the people not to chufe for
themselves ?
H. Because they would not chufe rightâand it
svas too much like the old Constitutionâso they
Taid.
A. And who were to chufe the Senators ?
H. The people were to chufe men to chufe
themâl don't well understand it.
A. Will there be no end of distrusting the peo
pie ? Have our gentry so soon forgot where they
sprung from ? I fuppole the people will not be
trusted to get their own children, by and by.â
But h< )vv did it end ?
H. It was voted at last, that the people lhould
chufe the Senators themselves.
A. Very goodâl'm glad to hear it.âWhat was
the next thing ?
H. Compound rations was the next.
A. Compound ration*! what's that ?
H. 1 did not quite undei stand itâbut they talk
ed as if a rich man was to have a great many more
votes than a poor manâSomething about reckon
ing a man's head worth twenty (hillings, and
then making compound rations of his head and
his money.
A. What! are we to be governed only by the
wealthy ?
H. Why not ? Would you have beggars and
vagabonds govern us ?
A. No, by no means ; for beggars and vaga
bonds always vote on the fide of the rjch, whe
ther they are right or wrong; io that the weal
thv will always have full as much weight as they
ought to have, without increasing the number of
their own votes. The middling class of people,
freeholders and houfeholdei s, of moderate pro
perty, fettled refulents, who live industriously
upon'their labor, are the firmed supporters of
the country. They have a firm attachment to
their country, and they are free from tliofe am
bitious, aspiring thoughts which lead a man to
seek his own aggrandizement at the expense of
his neighbours. A rich man 13 always wishing to
be richer and greater ; and he always has a rab
ble of needy dependents ready to aiiilt him. He
need not be helped to more influence.^

A. This might be done. Suppose that nobody
was to vote till his name had been at least a
welve-month on the county tax books, and the

H. Well! Andrew! you could always out-talk

H. O ! they had not finilhed that yet. â
A. No !âand when do they expetlt to get thrrt

H. Some time next Summer, they talk.
A. Some time next Summer ! â\V hy I thought,
when some of you were carrying petitions about,
you told the people they were to lave expences ;
that the 'Convention would fit only a fortnight
and make us a cheap government. â
H. Why;âyes;âit wasâsomehow so ; âbut,

A MESSAGE from His Excellency the Governor, to the General AJfem
bly of this State.
Gentlemen of the Legislature,
THE Amendments proposed to the Constitution of the United
States, and the other Communications which have been made
to me in your Recess by the Direction of Congress, will be fub

required by the Resolutions accompanying these Papers, for the

state of our Finance*, and evince the necessity of a permanent
Arrangement for the support of Government and the maintenance
of the public Credit. lam happy to observe, that manyintereft
m r Obje&s which have si nee the close of the War occupied much
of the Time of the Legislature, ire now accompli (lied, and that it
will confequentiy be in your Power to devote a greater Portion of
your Attention to this important Business.
I conceive it proper, at this Time, to remind the Legislature,
that in the Course of the present Year the Period will arrive when

Affcmbly.

Lands, directed to be fold, is complt ated, and that such Progress

duals c ntitl dto them without any further actual Surveys. I flial 1
direst the Accounts of the Expences, which have accrued in those
Services, to be lodged in the Audttor'sOffice for Liquidation, and
I slater myfelf it will be found, that as great a regard to Oecono
my has been observed a the Nature of the Business, and the Ob
structions which attended the Execution of it, would permit.
With refpefl to the Measure recommended more immediately
to my Care by the con urrent Resolution of the Senate and At

that in the report df the Secretary of the Treasury, the Reve
nue which may He expelled from the Poll-Office is eft'mated at
100000 Dollars âthis is so contrary to pall experience, that I can
not but suppose, that in addition to enhancing the rate of poftagc,
fume new arrangements are contemplatedâthere is one which
appears to me very effeniial, aud that is to give the Merchants and
others a greater opportunity to answer their Letters by the return
of the poll by which they are receivedâThe practice of clofin *

NEW-TURK, JANUARY 16, 1790.
FROM CORRESPONDENTS.
The public anticipations are more than realized by the commu
nications made to Congress at the commencement of the present
feflion. During the recess it appears that the Executive Depart
ments have been inceflantly employed in forming the necessary
arrangements, colle6ling information, and preparing public busi
ness, in such manner that the National Legislature has the most im
portant obje&s brought immediately before themâand there is no
doubt, but that they will proceed in the difcuflion of every fubjefi*
with all that unanimity and dispatch, which is compatible with
doingjuftice to the general interests of their constituents.
How mull the bosom of every friend to the United States ex
pand with pleasure, in contemplating the situation of our country,
as delineated in the fpcech of The President to both Houses of
Congress: What a generous confidence in the patrio(ifm of the
citizens ! And what a glow of hope, that as they have begun, so
they will continue to appreciate the bleflings of good govern
ment, under the best Conilitution ever conferred upon any of the
sons of men.
Of the Report of the Secretary of the Treasury much may be
said ; but as it will shortly belaid before the public, an anticipation
of iheir opinion, will doubtless fall below the sentiments that will
be excitcd on its appcarance.
Another correspondent informs, that a number of the fe& call
ed Shakers, having, thro the benevolence of a certain Societvâ
not an hundred miles from John-Street, been indulged with the
use of their Tabernacle for a few evenings part, to hold their par
ticular meetings in, hasoccafioned those extraordinary appearances,
noises, See. which have excited so much speculation.âThere is
nothing new in all thisâthere was a feÂ£fc in Persia a thousand years
ago, that beat this hollow, in writhings, contortions, groanings
and fcreechings.

LEVI PEASE,THE OBSERVER.
No. XIII.
0;:r national happiness mujl depend on the perfection
oj our union.
DIVIDE and govtrti, was the policy of Great
Britain to keep the Americans ill subjec
tion, before our emancipation fram her au
thority ; and it is now the policy of thole who
wiffy to embarrass our councils and defeat the ge
neral government. The success of this artifice
is manifeifc.from the strange conceptions of each
other, entertained by the inhabitants in the ex
tremes of the United States. before our'happy
revolution. An intercourf'e in war and policy,
has done much to remove these prejudices of ig
norance, and we findthatnn American, whether
he were born in New-Har.ipfhire or Carolina, is
a reasonable being, is capable of friendihip and
honesty, and if he be decently treated will re
turn the civility. Ignorance on this fubjedt is
now Co far removed, that when I hear any one
' difleminating prejudices againit a distant part of
the union or endeavoring to prove an irrecorr
cileable oppofltion of interests, I immediately
l'ufpeifl his heart of apolitical poison ; and that a
mifebievous againit the government,rather
than ignorance of men is his motive to asperse.
If there be any who cannot dilate their affec
tions and policy beyond our ancient colonial ju
rifdic r tions, they ought immediately to quit the
country, and feck an insular situation, where
rocks and waves may be an unchangeable boun
dary, to their brotherly loveâfor fucn,our parent
isle will be a happy retreat, where a charity and
national (yftein of three hundred miles in diiuen
fion will over-reach the limits of territory.
We often speak of the unionâthis union now
fubfiits in theory, and to make it permanent must
be in feeling and in practiceâit must rife superi
or to local attachmeu:sand boundary lines,to the
interest and deligns of a party âand inuft grasp
the whole. In the policy of a nation thÂ£ little
pailions ought to have no concern. In rhe home
bred labourer, who supposes his own diftritft to
approach near the extreme limits of human ha
bitation, we forgive the narrow apprehension
-< and its confequfcnces ; but in a lawgiver of his
country, or in any public officer, we mark the
weaknefi, and pity him as a man wliofe mind is
lels than his employment.
Gentlemen whopoflefs delegated power, ought
not to forget the particular interests of their
constituents ; but this part may be over adiedâ
a thousand questions of opposite interest, may
be invented by a small degree of sagacity ; to
heal a?id not aggravate the oppofltion marks a
great politician âto adopt a pervading fyitem, in
which facrifices made by any part of the union,
lhall be compenfaied by equivalent benefits, is
the work of a/kilful lawgiver. A desire of po
pularity in their own small diftritfts, with some,
proves a temptation to be very curious ill difcov
â¢ ering local interests ; this may succeed for a time
but as the motive is not the moll honorable, must
in the end defeat the very purposes, which it was
designed to promote.
In a country of free electors, where all have
some property, there is a worthy pride on this
fubjedt; those are molt relpcifted, who unite an
economical care of the peoples' interest, with a
magnitude of mind commensurate to national pur
poses. A good subject had rather lose a few
pence annually, than to hear it said his repre
sentative is aman of litttle and felfilh views.
In the galleries of the State Legillatures, I have
often observed rhe feelings of every fpedtator,
wounded, by the riSng of a member tp give in
formation, that the measure is again]} the intercjl
of his town or county, and therefore he r?mj} oppofeit.
The influence of example is great! We have
sanguine expectations, that the magnanimity and
enlarged national views, manifefted by all the
gentleman of our general representation, in their
laftfelfion, will have a salutary effect onthefeel
ings of thnfc, who legislate for the particular
States. âWhen we remember that every mind
was fupcrior to territorial prepofleflions, and en.
larged as the empire to which they! give law !â
When we refiedt, how they considered themfelvcs
adting for a nation, and not for a single State ;
and that they were not known even to name
their own ancient dominions, left it should be
construed into an anti-national meaning ! When
we observe that the fpivit of conceflion brighten
ed to the very clofeof their meeting, and shone
with most dazzling luftve, on the question of a
permanent feat for government ; we are f'urprifed
by fucli superiority of human weakness ! âSuch
examples must be powerful 011 the feeling of
every State ! âFrom this moment, a patiiotifin
not confined to little limits will inspire our State
councils ! âAnd every informed citizen, will con
sider hi mfelf a fubjedt not of one ; but of the
United States !â
The final adjuftmenf of a revenue system, is
a fubjedt more exposed than any other, to the in
trusion of local views and ancient prepofiefljons.
Both rulers and people mull expect to facrifice
some feelings, which were pardonable in our old
ftateof feparatiori ; but in our newfjate ofuni
oil are wholly unfit. The iiian cannot be a good
fubje<Tt, who on a proposition of public
firlt enquires within himfelf, will this work in
exclusive advantage to my own town, county, fr
ltate j with this ipirit he will be forever grum
bling at imaginary wrongs, and his brain w{ll
be diltraCted with political phantoms which have
no exiitence but in his own jealousy andfelfifhnefc.
Either break the chain of union, and let eve
ry part get what it may, in the general wreck ei
property and honor; or make the union, as real
as ic is ostensible ; and the only way for this, is
to be one in legislation, in a judiciary fyltem, in
finance, in public funds, and in the manner of
taxation and forming a national revenue. If in
this great republic, there are to be thirteen trea
sury departments ; each jealous of the other,
and armed with such hostile cunning as thefevd
ral States can produce and all of them mofljeaicifJ
of the general treasury : if every State is to have
a plan of revenue from trade and bufinels,artfullV
calculated to entrap its neighbors : If each State is
to have afeparate debt, for which they mult pro
vide, by means the most anti-national in ttieir ope
ration ; certainly ourunion cannot be perfected.
Demagogues and men of dishonest principles
but popular views, will take occasions from the
disorder to dilieininate the fteds of contention
betweefi the Statesâthe low paifions of the peo
ple will be kept alive, and in the hour of palfion
they will lubmit to such State measures, as in tÂ»ie
end mull rob them of prodigious property ; for
it is not polfible for the several States to provide
for our debt, info economical a manner, as it
may be done by the united power. The old me
thod of requisition oil the Sjates hath t>een found
futile in the extreme ; and for Congress in tax
ing the States, to have a motly pvocefs adapted
to the several modes of aflelling and collecting
now used in each, will keep alive of
partiality ; and prevent order, regularity, and a
similarity of decrees in the higher departments
of the treasury. Uniformity in the manner of
taxing and collecting through the whole, 1 con
(ider as a principal ltep towards the perfection of
our union ; and to be uniform, the system of the
United States, mutt overlook all local cultoms,
and Hand on its own basisâit mult adopt a Ample
process, which may be understood by every kind
of people in the union ; and such I conceive is
the proposition of a land-tax which I have here
tofore made.
There is nothing in the circumstances, either
of theeaflern, middle or southern States,, which
in the opinion of an impartial mind, ought to
mili tateagainft a plan offimilar operation through
the whole. People may have their jealousies ;
while the States were in treaty with each other,
it was neceflary to bear with them ; now we are
one people, have a right to the fame treatment,
and all jealousy ought to be done away.
FROM THE PROVIDENCE GAZETTE.
THE NEW YEAR.
THE commencement of a new year, it is hoped,
will be marked by a new aera in the policy of
this State. The fefiion of our Legislature, which
takes place on the second Monday of January
inlt. is anxiously waited for. The eyes of Eu
rope, as well as America, are upon us : and that
we may, at such an interesting crisis, walk wor
thy of our vocation, is the ardent wifli of every
friend to this and the United States. Bv adopt
ing the government of the Union, farmers, mer
chants, and citizens of every description, would
soon experience a pleasing reverse of circum
stances; wealth would flow in upon us from eve
ry quarter, and the bane of a community, the
Truck-Trade (which extreme necelfity compel
led us to adopt) become totally extinÂ«ft.
FffeClual Remedy Jor the Bite of a Mad Dog.
THERE is nothing, perhaps, so much to be
dreaded as the bite of a mad dog : for the
poison is so very infectious and penetrating, that
it takes efFert thro the clothes, without fetching
blood ; by the breath of the animal drawn into
the lungs ; by a touch of the tootli if recent ;
and applying it to the lips or tongue, when it
has been long dried ; by handling the wound, or
instrument, which was the death of the animal;
or by handling things which have been infected
by any of the former means.
To prevent the fatal consequences that too
often attend these accidents, the following (which
is the famous Ealt-India Specific) is recommended
to be given in a glass of brandy :
Take native cinnabar, and factitious cinnabar,
of each 24 grains, musk 16 grains, make it into a
powder, and give it one dole, as ic was given in
the following cafe :
A poor man was bit by a mad dog, and after
using divers medicines, was invaded withaftrong
hydiophobia, and being confined in Greenwich
was treated with the above medicine as follows :
His teeth being forced asunder with a knife, he
took one dose : three hours after the' hydropho
bious symptoms were abated, he fwfillowed a se
cond dose, which by next morning almost reco
vered him ; he took a third dose in a fortnight,
a fourth in a month after, and never felt any
more of the hydropliobious symptoms.

very foundations, exhibiting afcene of ruins like
ihe effects of a violent convulsion of nature.
The policy of this warlike and ferocious Prince
appears to be, to gain Indoftan entirely to him
felf, and to destroy all intercourse between its
inhabitants and Europeans For this purpofr,
lie has ordered every pepper-flirun to be rooted
up, in his dominions, and every object of com
merce to be destroyed.
Tippoo's numerous troops are under the most
excellent discipline : theEnglifh byfighting them,
and the French by aidingthem, have taught them
the European art of war. A great number of
Gen. Matthews's army, who were captured last
war, and other Europeans, are now in his pay.
It is said, the probable confequenceof the mea
sures of Tippoo and the French will be, the en
tire expulsion of the English from the peninsula
of Indoftan ; when, pursuing his plan of policy,
Tippoo will turn about, and drive off the French
also. ,
If to remove usurpers, and to obtain the entire
government of Indoftan, for the fakeof establish
ing a beneficial commerce with the reft of the
world, appeared to be the objects of Tippoo, we
might perhaps be juftified in wifhinghim success:
but we fear he is actuated only by revenue, and
an ambition to govern by military lawâ"hat he
means to prevent a friendly intercourse between
his subjects and the inhabitants of the other parts
of the globe ; and to wage a general war against
the arts of peace, which have had so happy an in
fluence upon mankind.
