Conscience, the burthen of the song,
Whether the action'i right or wrong.
A
AN enlightened Conscience is the vicegerent
of Heaven in the foul of man : It fits in judgment
upon all our aiftionsâand from its decisions there
is no appeal. It applauds our condudt when re
gulated by jlilt principles ; and condemns every
deviation from the paths of retftitude : Itfupports
the mind under fuflerings in a righteous cause ;
and plants a dagger in our bofoin amidst the ap
plauses which we are conscious we do not merit.
Conscience is however a term of very equivocal
import,applied to those principles either religious
or political, upon which different ideas are enter
tained by mankind. Religious opinions, in an
especial manner, have made fad work with the
infallibility of Conscience: It has converted it
into a convenient engine to coinpafs the purposes
of fuperftitution, enthusiasm and ambitionâand
men have been plundered, butchered, and burn
ed at the flake, "for Conscience fake." âTis edu
cation that gives, in a great ineafure, tlietimflure
to Conscience : The follower of Mahomet feels
no compuntftionattheviolation of laws, with the
observance of which, the catholic thinks the en
joyments of Heaven are inseparably connedled :
One thinks that to eat flefli in lent, is a damnable
fin ; the other anticipates the joys of paradifeiu
the pleasures of his seraglio. The mind that is
overlhadowed with the glooms of enthusiasm,
feels its conscience wounded, when it beholds a
chearful countenance, and a disposition which
realizes that "to enjoy, is to obey." To wear a
hat, or to pull it off, is a question of conscience
with someâand to defend thatlife and property,
â¢which men enter into focieiy more fully to pro
teift, and more effectually to enjoy i is a Humbling
Hone, and a rock of offence to those who never
refufed o participate the peace and fecuricy,
purcliafed by 'he blood anil treasure of their
nei"-hb3rs. Conic'ence works wondersâit has
transformÂ»d many a blockhead int > a pulpit ora
tor, wt- , ro get riil or the curse, " ill'the sweat
of thy brow malt thoueai bread," pretends con
science, when he forfakes his hoiieft calling, and
becomes a rambling retailer of raving nonsenseâ
" a blind leader of the bilnd."
As to a political conscience, we have not heard
much about it, since the explosion of pajftve obe
dience, and the right divine. At the beginning of
the revolution, some artful tories played a few
tunes upon this firingâbut the people were too
penetrating not to fee thro their jesuitism, and
they soon relinquiihcd the hope of railing a
schism in the consciences of our countrymen âfor
they found that 110 article of faith in their poli
tical creed, was more firmly established than this,
that
" Refflance to Tyrants, is obedience to Cod."
Some make conscience of relieving thediCreffed
but the miser's conscience has a reverse direc
tion his conicience will overflow in good wishes,
" be ye warmed, and be ye clothed," âbut to
bellow any part of his wealth to realize the text,
is utterly againll his conscienceâand under the
pretence of providing for his own household, left
he should be called an infidel, he monopolizes the
bounties of providence, and becomes a curse to
the world " for conscience fake."
How important to our peace and tranquility
then is a good conscience !âWith refpec r t to the
eternal principles of right and wrong, every ra
tional being has an unerring monitor withinâ
but opinions usurp the 1110 ft arbitrary dominion
over the human mind. Happy the youth whole
understanding is early conducted into the path',
of virtue, philosophy, and fcieneeâwhe escape ;
the timfture of enthusiasm, and the fetters of
prejudiceâwho can give a scope to hisjudgment,
and draw his maxims from the fountains of truth,
experience, aHdrightreafonâto fuchamind, the
universe is harmonyâbenevolence is its element
and the Deity a delightful source of hope and
contemplationâfrom which alone can result a
" confcienee void of offence."

Further remarks on a land tax.
writer of this paper, tho' unknown even
A to suspicion, and distant from fame, wishes
to be thought an houeft man. Such fubje<ts as
he is considering, are apt to excite a suspicion that
fume evil is designed , these suspicions may be
fomented by the litigious, but with the body of
mankind, their origin is from a generous love of
freedom, and a determination to vindicate their
honeit acquirements.
After so many delusions, and ill concerted poli
cies, the Americans would be stupid indeed, did
they not watch every proposition of measures as
it rises. Next to personal liberty, the preserva
tion of property is the nioft sacred object which
can be affected by government, and taxation is the
great instrument by which government acts on the
p operties of the people. The propolal of a land
tax is a weighty subject, and a firm conviction
that it is the molt direct way of emancipating
you from a fyftem,which you can never reduce to
calculation, is the real'on of iny doing it. A citi
zen is unfafely situated, when the demands made
on him by government, cannot be reduced to
previous estimationâbut can you do this under
your several State lyftems i You cannot deter
mine from year to year the manner, nor the pro
portion, nor the articles in which you are to be
taxedâYou choose aflemblymen once or twice a
year, and from a long habit, they consider it as
juftiuable to make sudden alterationsâthey im
nofe new sums, of which yon htive no ( intelligence
but by the warrant of a tax gathererâthus cir
cumltanced, 110 previous effimate of what you
inuft pay can be madeâthis I consider as an evil,
not of the gentlemen who serve you, but of the
system you are pursuing.âWarrants go out from
the State Treasurer against certain diltriifts for
certain sums ; subordinate officers make the tux
bills against individuals ; the law, gives them a
rule ; but not one in ten of the people can tell
whether this rule be honestly followed : If the
multitude of your tax gatherers are not ftricftly
honest, there will be some over charges, and if
discovered, it is easy to call them mistakes. It
wounds the feelings of a good fubjeit to wrangle,
either with his law givers or collectors, and the ,
thing pafles. A fiinple charge on all lands, can
be previously estimatedâthe planter knows the
number of his improved acres, this once ascer
tained answers forever, he forefees and provides
for the exact demand, and there is no poliibility
of fraud.
I already hear it objected ; the proposal is partial,
for improved lands are of unequal value, and fame
one acre may be worth half a dozen others.
The fame objection lies with greater force a
gainst your present systemâThe tax you now pay
on lands supposes them of equal value, only dis
criminating the kind of cultivation. Your polls
are equally assessed ; one of these may be sagaci
ous, healthy and rich, and very profitable to the
man who carries it ; while another is void of all
discernment, sickly, poor and anexpenfive bill to
the ownerâyour cattle are equally taxed ; when
it is known some one beast, either for sale or im
provement, maybe worth ten others in the flock
âand this is the cafe with every article in your
taxable estate as it now stands.
No kind of property has a greater equality than
the foil of the earth, the acres, naturally more
productive are few, and superior cultivation is
the chief thing which gives them an advantage.
Taxing high cultivation, in moftinftances, is but
taxing the industry which one man has greater
than another ; and in this view of the subject,
comes nearer to injustice.
Improvements in the art of liufbandry Ir<rse
made different kinds of foil much nearer in value
and profit, than they were half a century pastâ
vast extents of earth, lately supposed of no value,
by cropping thetn suitably are made
and daily improvements in hulbandry, increases
their equality : but if after all, there be any foil so
poor it will not pay a small tax, it ought to be dif
mifled from cultivation and planted with trees,
to prevent that fcarctty of timber and wood,
which will soon become an intolerable evil to the
poor, in the ancient parts of this country.
To do fractional jufticein a matter of this na
ture is impoflible. That system is the belt, which
comes nearest to perfect justice, is most intelligi
ble to the people, and may be executed with
smallest expence. Suppose the comparative value
of your lands were to be appraisedâto dojultice
the appraisement miift be frequently repeated,
and the expence will more than balance the gain.
I dread a system loaded with a prodigious number
of subordinate officersâif you pay them a small
[Published o/i We-dnefday and Saturday,
1 nra, their numbers will make an innnenfe a
mount ; if you do not pay them, thev will by
lome artifice pay them (elves from the hard earr
ings or the peopleâand when public measures
pais through an infinitude of managers, you can
not make them responsible, and the citizen:? under
the appearance of protection are pillaged at dil
cretion. Remember the late war ! It was the
humor of the people to multiply managersâyou
had public officers thro subordinate grades, innu
merable as the leaves of summer, down to captains
of a dozen oxen, flourifhing with the national
ceckade in their hatsâwith all this apparatus,
your armies fufFered every distress thro want of
the provisions then rotting in store. An absolute
monarch isjpolitic in encreafing the number of in
terior officers, for the additional expence creates
an influence by which he govqrns the people;
but a republic needs not this policy. A repub
lican government mull be grounded on economy,
on the affections and confidence of the people, on
general knowledge and happiness ; audit ouglic
theieforeto avoid a scheme of nieafures, that is
either intricate or expensive.
Another objection to the land tax, asjpropofed,
will be thisâthat the inhabitants in ihe great tovms
escape the payment oj a fuul proportioned to their ability.
The objection appears with weightâlet it be
candidly considered. The men of honesty
honor, will not vviffi to avoid their part of the bur
then, whether town or country be his relidence.
Where a tax on lands the only means of a nation
al revenue, the proposal might work injusticeâ
but by the joint operation of a national ii;spcft,
excise and land tax, the objection will be obviated.
Suppose twoperfons of equal interefl, one a ciri
zenin some great town, the other a planter in the
countryâthe nature of a citylife will lead to the
greater consumption of such articles as are char
ged with import and excise, so that the city inha
bitant payS double or treble the sum paid by the
other.
The inhabitants of a great town roust purchase
all their food and cloathing ; and it is not a love
of luxury, but neceflity that obliges them to do
this ; by which means they confurie a fcui fold
share of taxable articlesâatid duties on commerce
mult always have this eiFeCtâfor every man pays
in the proportion that he consumes the duticd
articles. The wealth of great towns is generally
overatedâthey present you with a /cw instances
of great riches, and a thousand of extreme indi
gence and wretchedness. Were the property of
large cities to be equalized among their irhabi
tants, a share would not be more than an average
with the country inhabitants. 'â  lie parage of
business, the (how of mercantile property, myh
of which is owned in the ba. k count , and col
lected for saleâthe luxury and idleness of a few,
with the general hilarity among a concourse of
people, are circnmftances, when he beholds them,
which lead the unacquainted planter to fuppoie,
that the people in great cities might pay a propor
tion, much greater than they do, without intol
erable wretchedness. Onthis stating of facts, let
a land tax be brought into joint operation with a
national import and excise. I think the objection
is obviated.

IT is to the honor as well as to the good fortune of this country,
that the bank, of England never since its firft foundation flopped
payment for one day,or evei used the least fubterfuge in payment,
but upon one occasion-, and that was one day during the rebellion
of 1745 J from a scarcity of specie, they paid that day only in sil

The attempts to aflenible the States of the pro

have been an expiring effort of the clergy and
aristocratic party, whom common danger has uni

probation, or concurrence of the people. It has
not succeeded in any one inltance. The meeting
of the States of Dauphiny, who were fununoned
by the Commiffioit Intermediairc, to meet on the 2d
ill It. is put off, by the fame authority, to the 14th
ol" December. Before that time the National
Aflembly will, probably, have completed the or

will prefer a general, uniform, and equal plan ot
repi efentation to the old arillocratic constitution

A Ihort account of Brabant, and upon what;
principle the Brabancons, at present, make re
liftance to the Emperor.
The province of Brabant is distinguished by
two divisionsâ firft what is called Dutch Brabant,
the second Aujlrtan Brabant.
The chief towns of the firft are Boifteduc,
Breda, Bergenopzoom, Maeftriclit, Grave, Lillo,
Steenbergenâof the l'econd, Bruilells, Louvain,
Vilvorden, and Lawden.
Antwerp and Malines are provinces indepen
dent of Brabant, though surrounded by it, and
fubjedt to the House of Austria.
The seventeen provinces, of which Brabant
forms apart, were, long after the decline of the
Roman empire, governed by their own Princes,
till swallowed up by the House of Burgundy â /
from thence they palled to Spain, and from Spain,
thole which are now called Austrian Netherlands,
are considered as a circle of the empire, and
contribute their lhare to the imposts ot the em
pire, but notji'ubjeÂ»ft to its judicatures; for though
the Archducal House, as being- Sovereign of the
whole, is the directing and summoning Prince,
the Constitution enjoins an Aflembly, or Parlia
ment, for each province, confiding of the Cler
gy, Nobility, and Deputies, who meet at Brus
sels, and who are convened to make laws for the
general good of the whole.
Conceiving those privileges trampled upon by
the late decrees of the Emperor, and, perhaps,
feeling the general spirit of Continental politics
at present in their favour, the inhabitants of the
different towns have armed and make refiltance,
the event of which time only can determine.

The following day, after some fkirmiflies, in
which only a few lives were loft, they nvadethein
lelves mailers of Lillo, the key of Brabant ou
that fide, and advanced towards Antwerp. In the
night of jhe 24th, they poifelled themselves of
an holtage, for the security of their friends in.
Bruflels. M. de Crumpiper, Chancellor of Bra
bant, one of the molt active among the agents of
their sovereign, wasfurprifed at his country fear
on the banks of the Scheld, by a detachment of
about 30omen,andconveyedtot.he head-quarters
of the patriots. They gave immediate notice to
the Aultrian officer that they would retaliate on
hiÂ» person any feveritiesexercifed on their imprU
foned friends.
This manoeuvre gave to the following
one 011 the part of the government: âCount Lan
noy, and three more noblemen of the most an
cient and opulent families in the province, had,
in obedience to the injunctions, and on the faitli
of the promiles contained in the Emperor's last
proclamation, returned to this capital from their
voluntary exile. They were yesterday appre
hended as hostages for the fafety of the Chan
cellor.
General Dalton has just issued the following
proclamation :
Whereas, several villages have hoisted the
Standard of revolt, their inhabitants have been
found in arms, and every thing drawn up in mi
litary order ; and as it is ellentially proper to
make the rebels return to their duty of fubuiiffion
to their legal sovereign, we notify, that notwitli
ftanding our repugnance to shed human blood,
and to render unhappy innocent people who may
be found amongst the guilty, we ffiall neverthe
less be reduced to the disagreeable necellity of
fire to all such villages as shall hoist the
Standard of revolt, or where any of-the inhab
itants Ihall have Ihewn themselves friends to ir,
by making refinance to his Majesty's troops.
In the general search made here for arms, even
the dignity of foreign Ministers was not spared.
The houses of the French, Dutch, and English.
Envoys were fcarched. The firft of these mini-fters sent a copy of the order to Search his house

Some of the Convents of Nuns havethanked the
National Aflembly for their decree, forbiding
any vows to be taken. There are other Convents,
however, who will not befo well pleased with the
decree in question ; however, taken in a general

No. XXXII.
When the Almighty form'd the spheres,
To rule the ever circling years,
His wifioin in the wond'rous plan,
Defign'd the happiness of man ;
And Time, while he his track pursues,
th' Almighty's glorious views.
THE number ten forms a series of years which
include as many remarkable incidents in the
liiftoryof mankind, as any that can be mention
ed. From the years 1760 to 1770, to go no
further back, the inhabitants of North America
experienced the melt important changes in their
situation, sentiments, manners, and views. Thro
their unparellelled exertions, the war in Ameri
ca was brought to a glorious termination : From
that moment we felt our consequence in the l'cale
of empireâand our views became enlarged ; ar
rived to maturity, our dependence on Great-Bri
tain became a very problematical event.
In 1770, we were on the eve of diflolving our
connection with the mother country ; from that
time til 75, how rapidly events crowded upon
each other, to bring the important crilis. Many
supposed we were ripe at that date for the revo
lution ; but some wife, and penetrating patriots,
whose names need not now be mentioned, repres
sed the ardor of too sanguine dispositions, till
the people were fully prepared, and the infatua
tion of our enemies was completeâThe mine
was then fprung âand our Independence was
establishedâso that in 1780, nothing lhort of om
nipotence could have carried us back to our for
mer situation.
From i 730, to 1790, the retrofped: gives a per
iod that amazes, altonifhes, and alinoft confounds
us in the contemplationâWhat victories ! what
triumphs ! what exultation ! what Utopian
schemes ! what embarrassments ! what alarms !
what fluctuations of councils ! what imbecility !
what fears for the sacred ark of liberty, amidst
the dread of anarchy, the prostration of law and
government, and the unrighteous and-lliameful
expedients of tender laws, and that corse of all
morals and national character, paper money !â
But that arm, which is omnipotent to save, roused
us from oilr low state of degradation, and awak
ening as from a delirium, Amcrica oncc vlore role
to her wonted magnanimity. The 2hree last
years lhe has done more to ellablilh her charac
ter, than in all her exertions in the darkest tno.
incuts of her conflictâgreat in the hour, when
greatness is adorned with its brightelt lnftre, lhe
hath eilabliihed her fame and happiness on the
immortal pillars of laws and government; realiz
ing that lhe fought for a lhadow, unless her ac
quilicions of liberty and independence were se
cured by the barrier of a just and free Constitu
tion : With aftonilhing unanimity lhe hatli adopt
ed a fyllem, that, if the people continue-wife, will
perpetuate their felicity to the final cjnfuinma
tion of all things.
We are now arrived to the beginning of the
last ten years, in the eighteenth century âand
taking ourcalculations from part experience, how
pregnant does the womb of Time appear. The
concentration of the wisdom of our country hath
ondutfted the States into the path of honor and
fafetyâa glorious reward awaits her toils and la
borsâthe road is narrow at the outset, but wi
dens as we advanceâthe timid, the doubtful may
hesitate, perplex, and draw back, but the intre
pid patriots will persevere, till the salvation of
their country is perfected.
With grateful hearts then, let us adoVe that
providence which, after giving us the victory
over our enemies, hath at length enabled us to
triumph over ourselvesâand in the words of our
beloved President in his fpeecli 10 the National
Legislature, let us offer our " fervent fuppticatians
*' to that almighty being, who rules over the universe,
" -who presides in the councils of nations, arid whose
" providential aids can supply every human dejefi,
" that hit benedidion may confecrats to the liberties
" and happiness of the .people of the United States, a
" government inJUtuted "by thimfelvesJor these essen

1 ' employed in its adminijlration, to execute with fuc*
" cess the fund ions allotted to hit charge."
7'en years in the age of a country may be as
one tp the age of man : In the period between
this and 1800, may our country progress in Em
pire, true greatnefi and glory, and her liberties
be secured beypnd the reach of anarc liy and def
potifin ; and from her example, may the whole

13 ET WEEN two wealthy neighbors lived a poor
man, who had nothing but his industry to
depend upon. He was much indebted to Albi
nus, the proudest of his neighbors, who finding
that his circumflances did not allow him to pay,
threatened to take away his house, and to throw
him into ptifon, Gallicus, the other neighbor,
partly from natural benevolence,and partly from a
jealous disposition towards Alb in us,who was then
considered as unfriendly to the whole world, un
dertook the defence of thepoor man Columbel
l u s,and [pent his health and part of his treasure to save
him. Now the good man began to thrive, and to
form even some connection with proud Albinus,
who finding that fomethiug might b: got from him
cajoled him on every occasion ; but the exertions
of Gallicus in his favor had been too great,and
the times growing bad,GA llicus saw himfelf ob
liged to make great alterations in his family, and
reduce his expences, which occasioned a great
uproar amongst his numerous servants, some of
which ran away with bloody heads into the house
ofALBiNUS, where they inif-reprefented every
tranfaiftion of their former matter. The poor
man, forgetting his obligations to Gallicus,
gave a currency to these falfhoods, and polled up
all the scurrilous language of Albinus, and the
discontented servants of his friend and benefadlor.
When Gallicus was informed of this he was
more grieved at the behavior of bis presumed
friend, Columbellus, than at that of Albinus.

" If a man often changes his friends, 1 fiifpeft
he is deficient either in candor or difcernrnent."
WHEN we hear men complain of the fickle
nefsorinfincerity of their friends we should
not readily participate in their reproaches. Few
men poflefs the art of maintaining a tiiendfhip
through any great viciilitude of circumstances.
In a ftateof prosperity we are apt to demand from
our friends, more attention and refpetft, than we
deserve: In a state of adversity we are prone to
expedl more relief and patronage from others,
than they aredifpofed to communicate. Thus it
happens, that in almost any situation, we are li
able to make complaints, where there is no real
foundation. _
My neighbour Discretus is now upwards ot
fixtyl years old. The scenes ot his lifehavebeen
critical and diverfified. He allured me, in a late
converfation,that he never loft the friendfhip of a
person which he o nee poflefled ; and that he scarce
ever was acquainted with a person, who did not
become his friend. 1 his is the more extraordi
uacy, as Dischetus is not distinguished by any
brilliancy of talents, or generosity of condudt.
The'mediocrity of his abilities raises him above con
tempt ; but are not so eminent as to excite envy. In
/hort, he is a prudent man, who, though he may
gain slowly upon tlte friendihip or attachment of
liis acquaintance, never runs any risque of losing
what he does gaiu. If not warmfh Qfjfpij-it
to perform great or liberal actions ; he has the (.ac
tion toihun those that are mean and illiberal. HiÂ»
virtues are not carried to such an extreme in any
instance as to become a weakness or a vice. Ke
observes the line where the lhades of virtue and
vice meet,and walks so strait upon it,as always to
el'cape inconvenience or reproach. It is true some
men call him a negative kind of character ; but
this is not material so long as he does nothing po
sitively badj and avoids censure, in all his actions.
He never flanders any person ; ,nor does hs ever
extol any one to the Ikies. In his view, all men
are worth attending tofo far as not to incur their
ill will; but none are so meritorious, that he will
not treat them with some caution and reserve. By
not expediting too much from his friend he is fel
domdifappointed ; andby not promifingtoo much,
he is never charged with deception.

The revolutions of time, give birth to the vo
lume of events which forms the general liiftory
of mankind. The contemplative mind traces the
progress of effe<fts from their caules, and marks
the invariable similitude between the series of
past and present times where the fame principles:
appear to (tamp the predominating features of
t}ie age. Empires commence, progress to matu
rity and then link into oblivion ; and this has
been so undeviatingly the course of things, that
those who contend that human nature is the fame
in all periods, have certainly the test of experi
ence on their fide. However the United States
according to some visionaries, are to exhibit a
new example to mankind. From the sublime
heights'of their political and literary attainments
they are to take a comprehensive view of all the
defects of humanity in all part ages, and having
the paflions and weaknefles incident to man under
the perfetf: controul of their reason, they are to
perpetuate their happiness and freedom, -without
the reftrair.ts of civil inftitutions,to the latest pe
riod of time. Those however, who view things
through a jufter medium, think otherwise; and
happy for our country, those who form a differ
ent estimate of human nature are at the head of
our affairs.
Public virtue is commonly a dormant principle
till great occafionscall it into exercise : Wife legi
slators therefore calculate their measures to touch
the more obvious spring of fit) intercft; and it is
happy for mankind, that the particular incereft of
individuals, and communities when properly pur
sued always conduces to the advantage of the ge
neral interest.

SIR, ' J
WE have long waited in anxious expectations,
of having it in our power to transmit effec
tual Amendments to the Constitution of the Uni
ted Stares, and it is with grief that we now fend
forward proportions inadequate to the purpose
of real and substantial Amendments, and so far
short of the wishes of our country. By perusing
the Journal of the Senate, your Excellency will
fee, that we did, in vain, bringto view the Amend
ments proposed by our Convention, and approv
ed by the Legislature. We shall transmit a com
plete set of the Journals of both Iloufes of Con
grefsto youraddrefs, which with a letter accom
panying them, we entreat your Excellency wil'.
have the geodnefs to lay before the Honorable
Legillature of the ensuing meeting.
We have the honor, of every sentiment of re

NEW-YORK, SEPT. 28, I /So.
SIR,
WK have now the honor of enclofiitg thr> pro
portion of Amendments to the Constitu
tion of the United States that has been fin illy a
greed upon by Congress. We can allure iu, Sir,
that nothing on our part has been on .ned, to
procure the luccefs of those radical am laments
proposed by the Convention, and appro\ dby the
Legillature of our Country, which as o consti
tuent we shall always deem it our duty with re
fpetl and reverence to obey. The Joui ial of the
Senate herewith transmitted, will at ,-,ce shew
exact and how unfortunate we have b< en in this
business. It is impollible for us not tc "ee the ne
ceflary tendency co conl'olidated en Ire in the
natural operation of the Conftitutio . if no fur
ther amended than as now propof ; and it is
equally impollible for us not to be pprehenfive
for civil liberty, when we know o no instance
in the records of hiitory, that fhe\ i people ru
led in freedom when fubje& to one ndivided go
vernment, and inhabiting aterrito y so extenlive
as that of the United States, and ,vhen it feeins
to us, the nature of man, and c things join to
prevent it. The impra<fticabil : yin s uc h cafe,
of carrying representation 011, ufficiently near
to the people for procuring the r confidence and
consequent obedience, compel a resort to fear,
resulting front great force ai . excessive power
in government. Confederate republics, where
the federal Hand is not pos iTed of absorbing
power, may permic the ex ence of freedom,
whillt it preserves union, ' ength, and fafety.
Such amendments therefore mayfeenreagainft
the annihilation of the State governments we
devoutly wHh to fee adopted.
If a persevering application to Congress from
the States that have desired such amendments,
fliouldlail of itsobjed:, we tire difpofedto think,
reasoning frqm causes to effe<Â£ts, that unless a
v dangerous apathy should invade the public mind,
it will not be many years before a constitutional
number of Legislatures will be found to demand
a Convention for the purpose.
We have sent a complete let of the Journals of
each House of Congress, and through the ap
pointed channel will be transmitted the Atfts that
have palled this feilion ; in these will be seen the
nature and extent of thejudiciary, the estimated
expences of the government, and the means so
far adopted for defraying the latter.
We beg, Sir, to be presented with all duty to
the Honorable House of Representatives, and to
allure you that we are with every sentiment of
