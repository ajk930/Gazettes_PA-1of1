In committee of the -whole on Mr. Ma,Jtfon's
rejuluticns.
[continued.]
Mr. Nicholas said he (hould not at
tempt to follow the gentleman lalt\ip thro'
his eloquent address, or undertake to go
into an answer of the variety of general
charges brought forward againil the reso
lutions.
He wished only to take notice of one
of two points in the debate. It \v a s
laid, that the exigence of the resolutions
would rather be a bar to the termination
of war than an inducement with ouf ene
mies to make a peace. Is it to be ima
gined, he sliced, if Great Britain intends
to drag us into a war, that she will a
bandon it without being compiled ?âââ¢
When forced to the neceflity of wishing
for peace, Will (he not be disposed to
grant us fomc advantages to have her conl
- with us put in as favorable a situa
tion as before hostilities, by a relaxtion,
at lead, of those resolutions. But are
we prepared to to fay, that after being
dragged into a war we are willing to make
peace without obtaining some security that
we (hall not be mole (ted in future > If he
Uriderftodd what a conduct truly dignified
On such an occasion ought to be, we
(hould infill not only on a reparation of
the injury and insult, but (hew to the world
that after obtaining complete fatisfa&iori
we were determined to obtain security a
gainst future aggressions,
The prefect measures did not, as has
been afTerted, originate in favoritifm, they
are not intended to repay a debt of grati
tude, they are drawn forth by the inju
ries infii&ed by one nation and are meant
to benefit the country for which we are
sent to legislate. If, however, in their o
peration they (hould benefit France this
was surely no argument against them, on
the contrary it ought to be an additional
argument in favor of them as we owe that
nation a debt of gratitude,
Mr. Kittera rose to call the attention
of the committee to the immense waste of
time which the discussion of these resolu
tions had ocealioned. Two months had
been in a great measure spent in discussing
them. It was like confultmg on the im
provements to be made to an edifice threat
ened by a conflagration. He hoped the
question would be taken.

Mr. Page. I acknowledge that thedeten
tion of our posts ; the indian war in con
fluence of that detention ; the Algerine
piracies which are supposed to be derived
from the fame source, and the violation of
our rights as a neutral nation, might fnr
nifli Congress with juftifiable reasons for a
declaration of war : but if war with Bri
tain and her allies be considered as a great
er evil than a war with the Indian tribe.;
the depredations of the Algerines, and of
Britiih cruizers, and the insult to the Flag
of the United States, Congress ought not
to declare war; nor to take any steps
which may involve the United S'.ates in
holtilitiesânor ought they to ftiew a dis
position to put any other conltruÂ£Hon on
the proceedings of the Britiih government,
than they have publicly avowed ; and as
the United States have so long evidenced
to the world their disinclination to make a
common cause with their allies, who un
doubtedly have less need of our nff-lbnce
now, than they had when Congress firft
met, and the enemies of our alii, s, parti
cularly Britain, (though (he indeed, some
time iince, when slushed with a profpeft
of success, iflued orders of an holtile na
ture againlt us) in all probability will soon
be disposed to peace.
I fay as this is the cafe, 1 cannot be in
duced to believe that the United States arc
in danger of a war with Britain; and to
(hew my disposition to preserve peace with
her, I prefer entering into regulations of
36,000
81,000
tu&ftf.Jir commerce between her fubje&s, and
our citizens, to a blustering bullying con- ,
duitâto a vain paiade of military prepa
rations, which may furni<h forne nations
with matter for ridicule, and the enemies
of our growing itrength with a hint of an
easy and effectual method of involving us
in ruinous expenctiv. Sir, if a declaration
of war had been made fcy Britain, or by
Congress, then the arguments used by
forne gentlemen againlt the resolutions
would have weight with meâbut as those
gentlemen, from what, till within a few
days, had fallen from them, appeared as
averse to war as 1 am, I cannot believe that
they will agree to a jdeclaration of war;
and without luch a declaration, 1 fee no
reason to be diverted from an attempt to
regulate our commerce, and in that man
ner, especially, Sir, which it was the wi(h
of our fellow-citizens it Ihould be regulat
ed ; a wi(h, to which I think we owe the
produdiion of the Federal Government,
and the exiftenceofthis House.
Mr. Lyman spoke nearly as follows
The difcuflion of this question hath al
ready engrossed much time. It hath been
postponed. I was in favor of a postpone
ment because, Sir, I then thought, I now
think the house were not in pofleffion of
all the information and premises neceflary
to guid; their determination on all the re
solutions proposed. It was then said, Sir,
that although we had aggravated com
plaints against Great Britain, (he could
not be so infatuated as not to render justice;
that those injuries were in atrain of nego
ciation and that it would be ralhnefs and
foily to interrupt them. I confefs, Sir,
that this reasoning had its weight with
me ; but the cafe now aiTumes a different
face. Is there any gentleman that still
doubts of the hostile and mad intentions of
that nation. Their aggressions have en
creafed: they meditate still more, and
have denied us in an unequivocal manner
any compensation ; they have added insult
to injury. Ido not fay these things with
a view to fire the public mind to resent
mentâthat is alraady done to such a de
gree as to want the rather to be allayed
and given a proper direction. But it has
been said, Sir, that instead of that firm
front of defence which the danger of our
situation requires, these resolutions are
important and triflingâmere pap. I can
not think, Sir, this language is any com
pliment to the understandings of either
the community, or this house, or even
the gentlemen themselves, who so zealonf
ly oppose them. If they are infignifi
carrt as the gentlemen declare them they
ought wholly to be difreyarded. No, Sir,
they are got infignificant; they present us
with a.part at lcall; of a just and temperate
defence against a nation that with unac
countable enmity plunders and insults
us. If they are infignificant, lam con
tent to be undeceived, as not compre
hending them. I do not intend at this
time to go into a minute consideration of
the general nature of the resolution ;
that hath already been amply done, and I
am convinced, and cannot be afraid to ha
zard my opinion to the public, that it is
founded in immutable natural principles,
that will itand the tell of time. There
cannot be a plainer explanation than reci
procity of advantages in navigation and
commerce.
It is for our interest to countera&the
commercial regulations of other nations
by those of our own ; to repel their fa
brics and manufactures from our country,
and to replace them with our own. We
have both the right and the power to do
it. These are truths that have been al
ways acknowledged in this country. Con
viction of their importance was one among
the causes which produced the present
constitution. We have hitherto forborn
the exercise of this right. Ido not pre
ted to arraign the motives, 1 believe they
were good, because, Sir, I recoiled that
our commerce and navigation for some
years until late hath been prosperous; al
though owing perhaps less to permanent
than adventitious causes ; to the fame cau
ses pofllbly which now conspire to oppress
and despoil it, and threaten a total difTo
lution. Was this not the cafe, I could
have been content, nay I would have pre
ferred ftfll further forbearance; but the
evils are alarming; something is unavoid
ably neceflary to be dqne, and as no gen
tleman propofea any substitute for the pre
sent system contemplated, I find mylelf
compelled to endeavour to make the bed
of thi*, with a firm reliance and perfusi
on that it wiH promote the peace and pros
perity of our country ; for I do not
think any thing we (hall do will have a
tendency to raaVe Great Britain lefa hos
tile or more friendly.
â¢She has already convinced us, and eve
ry one raÂ«ft be convinced, that we cannot
expeil any tiling from her moderation and
ju(lice*; and I hope we shall have nothing
further to fear from her force. I hope,
Sir, and I believe tins measure will attach
and encreafe the number of our friend#
and diminish and confoUmt our enemies ;
for I can by no means iubferihe to the
do&rine, that a national character is
wholly abdraoiled from all sensation of be
nevolence, gratitude, humanity,âvirtues
that so highly adorn iudiviitual characters.
These, Sir, are my imprefiions ; the re
sult of a cautious and even anxious inves
tigation, in which I have endeavoured
not to be transported by either pafiion or
prejudiceâbut to obey the calm dictates
of my understanding, with that inde
pendence and fteidinefs which is indifpen-
Cble. (To be continued.)
January 30.
(Mr. Madison's Speech concluded.)
Mr. H's letter he observed, closed the
correspondence on the fubjeit of commer
cial arrangements, being justly considered
by the executive as a final proof, that the
pawers of Mr. H. were incompetent, and
irrelative to the object ; and that it would
be improper to open a foi-mal negociation
with him, under them. His inftruftions
might be a rule and a warrant to himfelf,
but not being even exhibited, could be no
evidence of his authority, to the executive.
And his plenipotentiary commission in the
ordinary form, could never be underttood
as relating to the special objects he pro
posed to discuss. According to the usage
of nations, a special commission is, in such
cases, always furnilhed and required. Mr.
M. was persuaded, that no sovereign in
Europe would listen for a moment to such
a claim as that of Mr. H. and that the
Britifli court would have been offended
at such an one from an American minister.
He thought therefore that the executive
had equally consulted dignity aud pru
dence, in silently dnoppiug thy fubjeft in
the fame manner they did, until Mr. H.
should receive and produce adequate pow
ers in theaccuftomed form; as might rea
sonably be expected, if his court was c(uly
disposed to meet the United States, in an
amicable arrangement of commerce, by
treaty.
That the con ft ruction put by Mr. H.
on his powers, was inadmissible, appeared
to Mr. M. to lefult from theconftru&ion
itfelf. v Either thp general plenipotentiary
commifiion was tp be taken in the techni
cal and limited ferife in which it is appplied
to the ordinary diplomatic objects of a
stationary public minister ; or, in a literal
sense, without regard to fueh limitation.
In the former sense, it clearly does not ex
tend to negociations for a treaty. In the
latter sense it would extend to the concluji
on of a treaty, and not merely to negotia
tion, as Mr. H. explains and limits.
Mr. M. adverted next to the state of
the correspondence relating to the treaty
of peace. It appeared, he observed, that
as long ago as the 29th of May, 1792,
the Secretary of State had addressed to
Mr. Hammmond, a full explanation of
our rights and demands, under that treaty
âthat on the 2d June, Mr. Hammond
informed the Secretary, that he (hould
transmit it without delay for the consider
ation of his court; and accordingly did
forward it in the course of a few days; that
on the 13th Nov. 1792, previous to the
present meeting of Congress, Mr. H. was
desired by the Secretary, in pursuance of
a charge from the President, to let him
know whether an answer could yet be
given to the letter of May 29, 1782; Mr.
H. replied that it could not, ; but that
he was confident the delay was to be as
cribed to the continuance of the cause al
luded to in a former answer to a similar re
quell.
The cause alluded to was the interetting
po ft lire of things in Europe, which it
was said, had diverted the attention of the
British government to objeÂ£ts of a more
pressing nature ; and this consideration
had been urged by several members, as
an apology for the filerice observed towards
the United Slates. Mr. Madifonthought
very differently. The interval between
the receipt of the letter written by the
Secretary in May 1792 ; and the accelTi
on of Great Britain to the war against
France, had been fufficieut for the pur
pose of preparing and fending the proper
inftru&ions to Mr. H. Mr. M. added,
that the profpeÂ£t of being engaged in new
controversies of a more serious kind in
(lead <jf juftifying an inattention to an ex
isting one, ought to have quickened the
efforts for a previous settlement of the lat
ter. This is the courfc dictated by pru
dence, to nations as well as to individuals;
and where a right disposition concurs, it
is the natural course.
It had beeii mentioned as a further rea
son ajainll the commercial proportions,
at this time, that they might draw upon
us the resentments of the Combined pow
ers. Mr. M. could fee no ground for
such an apprehension. The Combined
powers were pretty fully occupied with
France ; they could have no pretext for
conceining themselves with us, in a cafe
where we did not concern ourselves with
them ; and there was the less room for
imagining that the combination could
mifconllrue the measure into an offence
against: them ; as two of the parties, Prus
sia and the United Netherlands were in
treaty with the United States, and are
favored by the propofitioris.
7. It was finally contended that admit
ing our situation to be such as had beea
described, the mode proposed was an ob
je&ionable one.
Mr. M. said he had no predilections for
the mode that could prevent his giving
a ready preference to a better, if a bfctter
should be offered. And unless it (honld
be said, that the Legislature ought to ad
journ without doing any thing for the
public relief, he thought it incumbent on
those who objected to one proposition to
fuhftitute another that would be less ob
je&ionable. By this he meant a propo
sition not merely better in itfelf; but one
that would probably be thought so, both
within and without doots; and be more
likely to coincide with the sentiments of
erery part of the union, as well as to con
ciliate a majority of voices in the public
councils,
The firft que!Kon,he said, was whether
any thing ought to be done. If this be
decided in the affirmative, as he presum
ed to be the Wenfe of a majority of the
committeeâand if war was not in con
templation as of course was taken for
granted ; the next question could only lie
between negotiation, and commercial re
gulations. Negociation it had been (hewn
was in no train, or profpeft, that could
juftify reliance on it. Commercial regu
lations alone remained. They would be
pacific in their operation. They were
the means belt suited to the temper of our
constituents. And he fmcerely believed,
that, If judiciously framed, they would be
more likely to answer the reasonable pur
poses of the community, than any others
that could be proposed.

Mr. Fenno,
The following opinion of the Attorney Gene
ral at Jamaica, throws some light upon an
interesting and very important fubjeftâ
its publication is therefore requested.
Opinion of the Attorney General of Jamaica.
CASE.âKingston, Feb. 12, 1794.
" AN American veflel was loaded with
flour by her owners in America, and sent to
Port au Prince in Hifpaniola, where her car
go was fold and by means thereof, and bills
of exchange, a cargo was purchased on ac
count of the owners, confiding among other
things of the produce of Hifpaniola, in the
months of October, November, December
and January last. The veflel left Port au
Prince on the 1 zth of January, and was taken
by a Bricifh privateer on the fame day, and
sent down to this Illand, where she arrived
before the publishing the inftru&ion of the
iix:h day of November.
The cargo has been libelled as French pro
perty âand your opinion and advice is
quelted, whether under the foregoing circum
stances, the cargo will be condemned, npt
withftanding it is proved American property,
and whether a claim fliould not be put in on
behalf of the owners, notwithstanding the
said inftrufUon."
ANSWER.
" I am of opinion the inftrufiion alluded
to, does not intend the condemnation of
it dire<sls to be flopped, and detainedâNor
can the term " legal adjudicaton" be so
understood with any proprietyâl apprehend
the objeÂ»fl of the inftru&ion is to guard a
gainst the too easy difmiflal of vessels and car
goes by the commanders of ships of war, at
their own discretion, and also to insure the
interruption of the supply of provisions to
the French colonies in hostility with Great
Britain âIf thereforfe the veflel and cargo
should by the court be adjudged neutral pro
perty, I am of opinion there can be condem
nation as prize.'

In the present situation of the affairs of the

regard to the imperious conduct of the British,
in the IVefl-Indies, (which (was pojftbly dictated
chiefly â¢with a view of diftreffmg the French;
the government will no doubt try what can be
done by negotiation, in order if pojfible to put
a flop to such proceedings in future, and obtain

THEATRE.
OBSERVER No. XI.
Mr. Fenno,
THE Observer has been indulged so often,
with room in your paper for his occasional
(ketches, on the entertainments at the New
Theatre ; that some of your readers may
think an apology neceflary j especially as in
a former number a repetition of observations
was announced. The Observer has been one
of those, who, altho' deeply irnprefled with
the late calamitous licknefs in this city, wilh
ed the New Theatre, not only to be opened,
but the players to be encouraged.
To sport with the feelings of such, as have
fuffered the loss of relatives and friends* the
Observer thinks himfelf incapable: And when
human life, and all its attendants, are viewed
in comparison with immortality, no man can
be more fully imprefTed, than he is, with the
relative appearance and import.âBut when
human nature is considered with the atten
tion, worthy of a rational Observer, it will
be found that dt'rverjions are abfolute'y neces
sary, perhaps to existence ; but if not to e.\-
iftence, certainly to the bappinefs of existence.
To this idea may be added, as a consequence
that mankind will inevitably pursue some
mode of diversion.
To direfl this mode, as rationally and vir
tuously, as poflible, is the wilh of the Observ
er ; may he not fay, is the wlfli of every good
man ? To arreit the natural career of man
kind towards a real or imaginary haÂ£>pinefs,
is not the part of a wife or good man ; but
to go with it, and attempt a regulation of its
pallioris, and a dire&ion to a rational point.
The Observer attends and encourages others
to attend the Theatre, because he thinks, the
tendency of improvement is greater, there,
than in most of the diversions, which will
certainly be indulged, if the Theatre is denied
them : He hopes, to call the attention of the
gay and unthinking of both sexes, to the ob
jects which are aione proper for their con
templation, at the refpeaive exhibitions ; to
corre& their excels, and excite the exercif;
of their goodness:
To mark the excellencies of performance
and performers; to hint the faults, if any
occur, and, gently urge a cure; and most of
all, he hopes, he shall be happy enough, to
contribute at least, to the benevolent task, of
wiftiing the tear from the eye of aftli&ion of
lighting up a smile on the face of grief, and
of alleviating the burdens of the " woe worn
heart."
A. B.
People of the last description, it may be
said, will not attend the Theatre; The Ob
server replies, that they may at least venture
to read his sketches, for they will contain no
thing to offend modesty, or wound
the heart of afili&ion.
If the Observer can contribute to the hap
piness of his fellow-citizens, if he can beguile
any portion of time, however short, and place
it to the account of virtue ; if he can " cheat
expectation and sorrow, of one weary mo
ment," and help to strew the paths of life,
with the innocent rose-buds of delight; he
has a confidence your readers may forgive
him, and feels that his conscience will juftify
him. With these views, and this apol >gy,
the Observer, will occasionally ask, for a small
portion of your paper, for his remarks on
the New Theatre, and the persons and things,
that therein may appear.

Extract of a letter from the Captain of a vel

" There has been 28 American veflelrcon
demned in Montferat, a measure they have
not dared to take in any other island, though
they stop all they can lay hold of. Their or
ders are to take all neutral veflels bound to or

which word has puzzled all the Judges in
their Islands, except that of Montferat, who
fays it means condemnation."

An EfTay on Slavery:
Designed to exhibit in a new point of view,
its effefls on moials y indujiry, and the peace of
society. Some faÂ£ts and calculations ate ottered
to prove tf\e labor of freemen to be much more
produdivc than that ot Jlaves ; that covmtrirs air
rich, powerful and happy, in proportion a; the
laboring people enjoy the fruits of their own
labor ; and hence the n ceftary conclusion, that
slavery is impolitic as well as unjujl.
