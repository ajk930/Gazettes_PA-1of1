Negligence sometimes fuffers a child to
grow up left-handed. But why are we all
to be only right-handed ? The right hand
was made stronger and more convenient
by habit, not by our Creator. The wisest
of God'a creatures fuffer habit, when they
have two arms, to confine them almost to
tally to the use of one. Let us copy the
ikilful fencing mailer, and teach our chil
dren the use of both arms indifcnminately.
Cases may be put, in which the left arm,
which now fetrat to be fixed to the body
only for the fake of uniformity, may save
the wearer's life.
Every man in the moment of deep
thought is addicted to some particular ac
tion. Swift used to roll up a flip of paper
with his flnger and thumb. Many people
have eontra&ed habits of this fort which
are ungraceful, some, even habits of inde-
cency.
Is your child a daughter ? Do not chris
ten her from novels and romances. Louii'a
and Clementina may betray ber into situa
tions which Elizabeth and Maiy never
dreamt of. Shenftone thank'd God hisname
was liable to no pun. Let an old man be
thankful he did not give his daughter a
name which sentimental writers would pre
fer to weave into a novel, or to " hitch in
a yhyme."

Theatrical exhibitions, and at these writers

of the authority of a few Clergymen, who
refufed to sign the address and petition
lately presented the Senate' and lioufe of
Representatives of the (late of Pennsylva
nia, relative to the pafilng of a Law a gain ft
vice and immorality ; you are particularly
requeftedto republifli in your Paper' from
a correa copy the said petition, with the
considerations subjoined in favor of the
fame. This rcqueft you certainly will not
refufe, as the fubferibing Clergymen have
been moil: wantonly abul'cd, in some of the
Philadelphia Newspapers, by a set of ano
nymous writers, who substitute railing for
reafotiihg ; these Clergymen, to their ho
nor be it spoken, though " reviled, revile
not again; though they fufFer, they threat
en not; but commit themselves to Hliri
that judgeth righteously" how fer the
non-fulfcribers have patterned after the
great founder of our holy religion, who
" left us an example, that we should fol
low his steps" mutt be left not with the
irreligious and prtfave, but with the men of
true piety to determine.
4 Profejfor of Chrifiianity*
Jan. 9, 1794.
To the Senate and House bf Representatives
of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
THE clergy of various denominations,
in the city of Philadelphia, whose names
are underwritten, observing, with much
pleasure, that an existing law of this iiutc
for the fupprefiion of vice and immorali
ty, is by the recommendation of the exe-*
cutive, to become the fubjeft gÂ£ legiflativc
revision ; and imprefied with a sense of
duty, which we conceive is incumbent on
us, both as ministers of the gospel, and as
members of civil society, refpeÂ£fully re
quest the attention of the legislature to
the following rcprefentation and petr
tion.
We represent, that the legislative in
terposition is, in ourapprehenfion, peculi
arly necelTary to make some irlTtci ual prO
viiion for the orderly and religious obser
vance of the Lord's day ; for the preven
tion and punishment of the profanation
of the name of God, and every species
of impious imprecation ; for regulating
and leflening the number of houses where
intoxicating liquors are fold and used, for
the fuppreflion of all places of gaming aad
lewd resort; and for the enacting of %
law to prevent theatrical exhibitions of e
very fort. We do accordingly, mod ear*
neftly petition and request, that in fram
ing an ast against vice and immorality ,vcti
would regard, with peculiar attention,
these important objects, ft) as to prevent
the numerous injuries to which our citi
7.ens are thereby exposed, in their morals,
their health, their property, and their
general happineis.
We conceive that the solemn Intima
tions of divine Providence, in the late dif
tre fling calamity which has been experien
ced in this city, urge upon (is, in the mcft
forcible manner, the duty of reforming
every thing which may be offenfive to the
Supreme Governor of the univerle, and
of doing every thing which may impress
on the public mind, a regard to his go
vernment, his providence, his kvvj, end his
ordinances.
The fubje&s to which we have request
ed the attention of the legiflaturc aie cf
confefled importance; they arc, moreover
fubjefts which are not I'o liable to contro
versy, orcollifion of opinion, as to render
U9 deiirou9 of entering into any detail <.f
argument in support of our petition ; ex
cepting only the part which relates to the
atrical exhibitions.
On thÂ«i w; arc aware that a difference
of fentimcnt cxifts. Some coiilidcrat'or.j
are, therefore, fuhjoined, relative to this
fubjict, to which the candid sttertion of
the legiilature is refpe&fully lolicited.
R.lii reliance on this, we cheerfully sub

J. The nature of dramatic coinpohtion
as it actually exilts in the Englilh language.!
It is not averted here, that uo lefFon of
virtue can be conveyed in a dramatic form,
or that the taflc has not fora&imcs been

and inconchrfive for pra&ice. There are
in fcie.jce a thousand lpenlatiorr. which
haw all the Icmblance of plaufibilitv and
ufer'alnefs, which can never be realized in
experiment, or which the attempt to rea
lize discovers to be worthleis or pernicious.
It is the part of wisdom and found policy"
to discern not only what is pofiible, but
what is practicable; not merely what may
be ccvceived, but what, from thr? actual
ilate of thing* must be expected, or is
known tÂ» take place. Guided by this
rule, and making,as in all reafoli we ought
the great rnafs of dramatic composition
now in the Engli/h tongue, the fubjecl of
decision, it is afierted, that the very na
ture of that composition is unfavourable
to virtue. Let tragedy and comedy be
hefe diitinctly considered.

The account of an attack meditated on

They are defended in front by strong

TRIAL AND EXECUTION OF
THE QUEEN OF FRANCE.
PARIS, October 16,
Yeileniay morning the once all-power
ful and beautiful Marie Antoniette,
consort of the unfortunate Louis, King
of France, the daughter, fifUr and aunt,
of Emperors, was brought like the mean
est malefa&or from the prison of the Con
eiergerie, and placed at the criminal bar
of the Revolutionary Tribunal.
The act of accusation, as prepared bv
the public accuser, was to the following
purport:
Marie Antoniette Hands chargedâill,
With having dilapidated and lavished the
finances of the nation, in concert with
the execrable Calonne, by earning to be
transmitted to the Emperor several mil
lions, which still serve to carry on the war
againlt France.â2diy, With having, in
imitation of Brunehaud, and De Medi
cis, who also called themselves Queens of
France, consulted against the Liberty of
the French Nation.âjdly, With having
fought to starve the people in 1789. â
4thly, With having excited the murders,
of O&ober 5 and 6.âsthly, With hav
ing in concert with Bailly and La Fay
ette, caused the patriots to be butchered in
the Champ de Mars.â6thly,With having
prevailed upon the Swiss to fire on the
people on the 10th of August 7thly,
Witii having like another Agrippina, for
gotten (he was a mother, in order to com
mit incest with her son.
Shocked, as this unhappy Queen must
have been at feme of the articles of her
accusation, and particularly at the last,
which seems to have been designed to load
her memory with infamy, {he heard them
with magnanimous fortitude and cornpo
fure, and replied without confufion, and
with dignity to the interrogatory, which
began as follows :
Presidentâ" What is your name?"â
Queen â" Marie Antoniette, of Lorrain
and Austria."
Prrfidentâ" Your Quality r"âQueen
â" I am the widow of Louis Capet,
King of the French."
[Here the witnesses were called in.]
Laurent Lecointrc, the firft witness
formerly Chief of a Division of the Na
tional Guard of Versailles, and at present
a Member of the National Convention,
related the historical occurrences of the
sth, and 6th of October ; and from his
relation it appeared, that the ci-devant
Gardes de Corps or Life Guards, were
the fiift aggrefl'ors.
Lecointre spoke also, though not as an
occular witness, of the nocturnal riot
which was oecafioned October ift, at Ver
sailles, by the late King's Life Guards in
the hall of the Opera. " Maria Anto
niette, said he, repaired to that banquet;
(he applauded the condudt of the Guards;
(lie alio vifitedthe regiment of Nafiau and
the Chauffeurs of Trois Eveches, who
were quartered in the Orangerie of the
Gardens of Versailles."
Queen â" I repaired, 1 mull own,
wit'n my huftand and his children to the
Hail ot the Opera House ; but I did not
fee that the national cockade was trode
under foot. It is falfe that I evct spoke
to the soldiers of the Regiment of Nas
sau, or the Chalfeurs of Trois Eveches."
Pref.dentâ" What did you lay to the
Life Guards when you appeared at that
orgieâOueenâ" I applauded that ban
quet, becaule it was to have produced the
union of the life guards with the national
guards."
Public AccuserâÂ« Have you not licld
secret councils at the house of the ci-devant
Duchess of Polignac. Councils at which
the ci-devant French Prince; assisted and
in which, after having discussed the fate of
the empire, you gave yourfelf up to the
infamous pleasures of debauchery !"
Queen â" All the state affairs were dif
cuiied in council, and no where else. I
have no knowledge of the reft of this as-
fertion."
Public Accuserâ" Are not Thouret,
Barentin, and De Efprcmenil, tlie autliors
of the articles of the declaration of June
23d ?" Queen â" The ministers in place
alone computed the council at that time."
Judgeâ" Did not your husband com
municate his defignsto you, when he in
vested the Hall of the Representatives of
the people with troops ?" Queen â" My
hufoand repcfed his confidence in me ; lie

was to have made on that occasion. He
had, in other refpefts, no bad intentions."
Judgeâ" Why did troops of the line
invest Paris and Vcrfailles i" Oueenâ
â¢ For the fake of general fafety."
Judgeâ" What life have you made of
the immense sums which you have been
entrurted with !" Queen â" No enormous
sum has been entrusted to me ; the ac
compts of my household will provte what
use has been made of all I have received."
Judgeâ" How did the family of the
Polignacs, who was so poor at iirit, grow
so rich !" Queen â" That family held of
fices at court which were verv lucrative."
The Queen was then questioned ref
pe&ing the flight to Varennes. She ac
knowledged that (lie opened the door and
led the way from the Thuillerics, and that
though they saw M. La Fayette as they
eroded the square of the Carousel, he knew
nothing of their flight.
Hebert substitute of the Commons,
then gave evidence with a view of fubftau
tiating the infamous charge of ir.eeft : and
stated that it was founded upon the con
fefficn of the young Louis himlelf.
When the Tribunal put the question on
this charge. The Queen indignantly re
plied as follows :
" 1 remain, Sir, silent on that fubjeft,
because nature holds all such crimes in ab
horrence," and then turning with an ani
mated air to the people, {he exclaimed,
" I a ppeal to all mothers who aie piefeut
in this auditoryâis such a crime possible ?'
After the examination had ciofcd, the
Queen was soon condemned, " its guilty
of having been acceflary to, and having
co-operated :n different manaeuvres against
the liberty of France ; of having enter
tained a correspondence with the enemies
of the Republic; of having participated
in a plot tending to kindle civil war in the
interior of the Republic, by arming citi
zens againit each other."
When the sentence was read, the Queen
cast down her eyes, and did not raise them
again. " Have you nothing to reply up
on the determination of the law ? said the
President to her, " Nothing," she replied.
He then addreiTed himfelf to her pleaders,
" and you officious defenders." Our mis
sion is fulfilled with refpeft to the Widow
Capet," said they.
This morning (the 16th) this unhappy
vi&im of democratic fury was iguominiouf
ly carried to the place of execution in a
common cart. The whole armed force of
Paris was on foot from the Palace of Jus
tice to the Place de la Revolution. The
streets were lined by two very close rows
of armed citizens. The Queen was in a
white loose dressâbut they had tied her
arms behind her. As she pafled along, the,
multitude frequently cried out " bravo."
At the place of execution (he looked firm
ly round her on all fides. She was accom
panied by the ci-devant curate of St. Lan
dry, a constitutional priest, and on the
fcaffold prcferved her natural dignity of
mind.
After the execution three young per
fonsdippedtheir handkerchiefs inherblood,
They were immediately arretted.
Fronfon de Condray and Chaveau de la

NATIONAL CONVENTION.
October 12.
Barrcre read a letter from Chateauneuf
Randon, dated Hestfd Quarters, at Lyons
Oct. 9, which ran as follows :
4< Citizens Colleagues,
" The actions of the 25th and 29th of
have been closely followed by pro?
digics of valor, and to night the troops
of the Republic entered Lyons. Thechiefs of the rebels, 2000 in number have
made an attempt to save themselves by
flight, but they are pursued on all fides,
and cannot pofiibly escape, not only the
ardor of our troops, but also that of the
people of Lyons, enraged at tbeir having
been deceived by them. I previously in
formed my colleagues of our entrance in
to Lyons. Gen. Doppet is going by an
extraordinary courier to fend a detailed
report of his military operations. Cou
thon, Mdignet, Laporte, Dubois, Cranee
and BafTel, who we had joined at St. Fox
are on the point of repairing hither, and
will be eager to inform you of all our o
perations. My Colleagues wish to keep
me here ; I the orders of the Na
tional Convention.
Chateauneuf R. an do v.
Signed,
P. S. " I have detained the courier to
inform you that the rebels have been pur
sued and cut to pieces on ail fides : their
train of artillery and the treasure which
they carried off are taken."
Barrere. The committee has deter
mined that not one criminal ought to es
cape ; they htve ordered the fugitives to
be pursued, and the tocsin to be founded
all over the country, in order that the peo
ple may be raj fed to exterminate them.
The traitors mull be taken, their pun
ithment mult be speedy : it is propel that
the inhabitants of Lyons Ihould be dil
armed, and their arms confided to the
youth of the South, who will employ them
agiiuft the (laves of Spain. But will you
allow a city Jo exist, which by its rebellion
has caused so much blood of the Patriots
to be Ihed? Who lhall dare to demand
your indulgence for this rebellious city ?
What ought you to refpeft in your ven
geance ! The houle of the indigent per
lecuted by the rich, those manufacturers
of which the barbarous English so eager
ly deli re the deltru&ion. What ought
you to refpeft ! The asylum of humanity,
the edifice consecrated to public instruc
tion. The plough ought to pats over the
reft. When the Pruflians last year inva
ded the territory of the Republic, the
Sgu.h affected courage and republicanism.
At present all is changed, the North now
defends Liberty, and the South makes war
upon it. In this fituition a great exam
ple is necefiWy, I propose the following
decree :
Art. I. u There lliall be named by the
National Convention, upon the presenta
tion of the committee of public fafety, an
extraordinary com million composed of five
members, in order to punilh the Revolu
tionills of Lyons according to military
law, and without delay.
11. ' All the inhabitants of Lyons (hall
be disarmed ; their arms (hall be immedi
ately distributed among the defenders of
the Republic. A part (hall be reftoied to
the Patriots of Lyons, who have been op
pressed by the rich and the counter-revo
lutionists.
111. " The city of Lyons (hall bede
ftroyed. Whatever was inhabited by a
rich man, (hall be demolished. The poor

proscribed patriots, the edifices specially
employed to iuduftry, and the monuments
consecrated humanity and public instruc

IV. " The name of Lyons (hall be ef

Teller day morning at three â¬ clod, Ge
neral IVurmfur nuule his prv.eQed attack
j upon the fines of the Lauvre, upon Various
points at the fame time. I have thefatisfic
tion to fay thai he is in poffejf on of every
part of them. Lauterbourg surrendered,
without any conditions, between three and
four in the evening, after* being evacuated
by the enemy, who, from the prodigious
number of redoubts oj which they were in
poj-effion, and the natural jlrengih of the
position, might have held out a siege of se
veral days.
This town rcfijhd some time longer. It
is surrounded by a large ditch', and <was de
fended by redoubts, from which the French
cannonaded the Auflrians for federal hours.
It is also connected with the Gielfberg, a
mountain which so entirely commands the
place, that if the French had determined on
deriving every advantage from their filia
tion, the Aujlricns could not have entered
into poffejjwn of it, without further successes
is the mountains. A part of the town was
burnt :n the course of the flruggle ; and the
French, before they retreated, set fire to
their magazines, both here and at AJfladt.
In other parts of this very complicated ope
ration, in which fix different columns had
dijlinfi plans to great success attend
ed the Auflrians. They fuccejfively carried
by ajfault all the different redoubts which
had been covflrufied in the front of the
French camps, of which the principal one
fell into tnto their hands, with all their
tents funding, several c affords, nine Jland
ards, and twenty fix canuons of very great
( calibre.
As these different anions are but jujl
overj and the Auflrian corps are very re
mote from each other, it is impojfible for me
to transmit to your Lortifhip, any account of
the killed, wounded or taken on either fide.
The army has been fourteen hours under
arms y almojl continually engaged in a very
aSlve pursuit, and often exposed to a inofl
tremendous Jire.
V/t have as yet no dflir.3 account of the
operations of the Duke of Brunfwick's ar

cannonade was heard on that fide during the

A letterfrom Sir James Murray, adju
tant General to the forces under the command
of his Royal Highness the Duke of Tork y
was received this evening by the Right Hon.
Henry Dundas t his majefly i s principal Se
cretary of State for the Home Department,
of which the following is a copy.
Engcl Fontaine, 0&. 18, 1793
Sir,
I had. the honor of informing you, in
my lad dispatch, that his Royal Highness,
at the earned request of the Prince of
Cobourg, had marched with a part of the
troops under his command, for this place.
They arrived here upon the 16th. The
prince, being acquainted with his Roval
Highnefs's intention, had been enabled to
withdraw from thence fodr battalions to
strengthen his other ports : a fifth batta
lion followed those upon his Royal High
nefs's arrival.
The eaemy, having collected in extra
ordinal y numbers, attacked the coips un
der the command of Gen. Clairfayt, which
was ported with its right near Berlemont,
and its left near the village of Wattigwie*,
upon the 15th and 16th. Upon the for
mer day the left wing of the enemy was
entirely defeated. Having advanced into
the plain which lay upon that fide between
the two armies, they were charged by the
Imperial cavalry, and driven back, with
great (laughter and the loss of twelve pie
ceÂ« of cannon. The attack which they
made upon the left of the Auftrians was
more obstinately supported j they were,
however, finally repulsed.
Upon the 16th the enemy having drawn
the greatest part of their force to the right,
again attacked the left of Gen. Clairfayt's
corps, and the village of Wattigwies.
They could upon this fide approach
within cannon Ihot of the Auftrians, un
der cover of an immense wood, called the
Have d'Avefnes ; which, when they were
repulsed, secured their retreat; they bro't
a great quantity of heavy artillery to the
edge of the wood, under the protection of
which they attacked the village. The ut
most firmnefs and bravery were displayed
by the Austrian troops upon this occasion.
The enemy were several times repulsed
with great loss; they were repeatedly dri
ven from the village after they had earned
it; but being enabled, by great superio
rity of numbers, to bring continually frclh
troops to the point of attack, they at lail
succeeded in maintaining the poflcfiios (â {
that post.
The communication between General
Clairfayt's corps and that of General la
Tour, which observed the entrenched cam])
near Maubeurg, being by this means cut
off, it was judged necefikry by the Prince
ofCobourg to abandon thepoiitioli which
had been taken for the pnrpofe of in veil
ing Maubeuge, the army pafied the Sam
bre in the night without the smallest lois.
Lieutenant General Benzowllcy, who
commanded a detached corps upon the left
of the army, defeated a corps which was
opposed to him, killed a great number of
the enemy, took four hundred prisoners,
and eleven pieces of cannon. Count I lad
dick, who was detached by Gen. I-a Tour,
likewise gained a coniiderabie advantage,
penetrated to Sorbe Chateau, and took
three pieces of cannon.
In the two engagements, the Auftrians
took twentv-four pieces of cannon and two
howitzers, without the loss of one on their
part. They have had about two thousand
men killed and wounded. There can be
no doubt that the loss of the enemy has
beet much more confideiable. The Auf
trians now occupy the left bank of the
No cota'n accounts have betn

October 24
We have just received a letter frcm Of
tend, dated the 22d 111 ft. at one o'clock,
P. M. which contains the following in
terelling paragraph :
" An express has this moment arrived
from the army of the Prince of Cobourg,
informing us, thnt after having re-croiTcd
the Sambre on the night of the 17th inft.
and expecting an attack from the enemy,
he sent Gen. Clairfait with 30,000
a circuitous route to lie in wait for them,
and retreated with the main army. As he
expe&ed, the enemy fell 011 him in great
numbers, but by this judicious measure,
they were attacked front and rear at the
fame period, and 15,000 men killed and
taken, with several pieces of cannon. Trie
Britifli troops had not arrived to (hare in
the glory oi the day."
Lord Howe failed with the fleet under
his command fix m Torbay, on Sunday
morning; but in consequence of diipatch
es sent from London, and forwarded to
hit lordihip by a fwift failing cutter, he
returned again to port, after being but a
few hours at sea !
Upon the probability that Brest and
Bourdeaux are ready to imitate the exam
ple of Toulon, Lord Hood is said to have
permitted four French /hips of the line to
leave the latter place, under flags of truce,
for those ports âExtraordinary as f'tch a
circumstance may appear, this, peilups,
is the bed method of making the experi
ment, whether the loyal patty has, or has
not, the ascendency at them.

Particulars of a late action,
This morning came into harbour the Cres

which she captured on Sunday morning, off

and 25 minutes.
The aSian began about ten o'cloii in the
morning, within pijlolJhot, ahuut four miles

light breeze of wind, which soon died away
to a perfect calm.âKarly in the aclion the

Extract of a letter from Nantz, dated
O&ober 16th, 1793, to Captain Mo-
I nary, Philadelphia,
I cannot lend you any news mote a
greeable or more glorious than, that the
Republic is saved notwithstanding the in
famous treasons that daily coine to light.
Cuftine fnffercd last month and many ge
nerals, who where of his plot, have itiarcd
his fate, but no matter, all is well, cairn.
England has loft 10 thousand tnen be
fore Dunkirk, and Spain has 101 l her three
camps near Perpigwan. We are in-Cata
lonia. The king of Savoy has lott all Ins
dominions, except Piedmont, where he â¢Â»
loclofely hemmed in, that he cannot ef-
cape : his treasure, cannon, and ammu
nition have ail fallen into our hands. Ly
ons is reduced to allies : 10 thousand emi
grants were there put to the sword, after
having sustained a (lege of two months#
Ail that remains to be iubdued is the de
voted town of Toulon, which has been
betrayed to the Englifn, and which we
are now dofely beficging with an army of
72 thousand men. Aa tor the lawleis bau-
Hitti of this country, who were io iniigm
ficant when you kft this, they are become
an objcffc of serious concern. In Jn- c
If ft, two hundred thoijCn;d of t-licm at
tacked us at all the points in the city, l>nt
were repulfcd with coufulcrable loss : iluy
two months, 180 thousand men of the
republican troops have been in puiiuit of
these insurgents. V
Not n day paftcs but they attack them,
and it is probable that before the end of
this month they will be utterly deftroyc.l.
All the navy, and all the merchantmen
are called into actual service. Preparati
ons are making for a descent on England,
and it is thought, that the troops hew,
consisting of ISO thousand men, are in
tended for that expedition. Naples ai: 1
the Duke of Tufcany have just deciaud
vvaragainftus. No matter; we are driv
ing all before us. The Auilrians, PruCi
ans, Hcffians and Dutch can hold out na
longer.
A frefh levy of 450 thousand men lira
lately been completed, uil well anned and
equiped; a part of them are ahead} 0:1
:he frontiers, and the reft arc loon tc
low. Another levy is now rsifiiig of the
like number, 40 thousand cavalry are al
ready enrolled, and on tlieir march for the
frontiers,
The firlt levy was composed of men of
every rank without diftindtion, from the
age of 18 to 2j, and the other levy whiih
is almost completed, is to be ccmpofed of
men from the age of 25 to j?. Every
young man and widower without children,
is obliged to march. All uteptils of ioa
and hells are carried to the national fenri
deries. Our calender is reformed. Men
of improved underiiandinrs have introduc
ed more order into it, and made it
worthy of a free people. We 1-ve expel
led from it all the flints, all the monu
ments of ignorance and fanaticifiri vvh'i h
have done so much milchief, a id which
are the causes of oar prefer.t fuffering*.
Inltead of those vile miscreants who owe
their canonization to their ilugg:lh li e
and their imbecility, we have fub'.tituwd
the names of those heroes who have done
honor to human nature in ancient times,
and who arc now our models. The months
are of 30 days, the wee!:s <-f 10, and at
the end of each week, a day is confec: at-d
to repose, and to the celebration of the
epoch of our immortal revolution. Four
hundred merchants and stockjobbers have
been executed at Maifcilles. This exam
ple has made that town and Bourdcux re
turn to the principles of our revolution.
Commercial ariltocracy attempt d to suc
ceed the arift cracy of tiir nobles and the
priesthood, but this the interior aepan
ments did not relish. We (hall be free,
and we (hall leave to posterity either a
dreadful caiaflrophe to bewail, or grand
examples for imitation.

VOLUME X. OF
Encyclopedia ; or Dictionary
Of A ts, Sciences, and Miscellaneous
Literature, on a Plan entirely new ;
Br WHICH
The Different Science* and Arts,
are d'grjied into the form of
Diltintt Treaties or Sylienis :
TIIIS volume contains principles of Levels,
Liberty, Dxfti ine of Lighr, Lightning,
Locks, Logarithms, Logic, History of Lon
d"n, Longirude, Luther, Lvdia> Macedon,
Madagascar, Magic, Magnetifni, Malts, His
tory of Man, Marriage, Mary, Maryland,,
Masonry, Materia Medica, Meadow, Mecha
nics, with 2 great variety of Biographical and
Mi fee! la neon* articles, illulkrated with Twen
ty two Copperplates.
As a number of families are still in the
country, and it if not generally known who
"Streretuvned. T. D>bfon, solicits the favor
Â°i the fubfcrbers to call or fend for their vo
lumes, that they may be supplied as early as
poflible.
The tskth volume of the Encyclopedia is
now presented to the public ; but as it makes
its appearance in an imperfect state, fume ac
count of the reason of that imperfection should
be :iven. On the 8:h of September last, the
Pub'ifhsr had the misfortune of haviog his
Printing O/fice burnt down by a fire which
broke out in the neighbourhood, and a great
quantity of his printing materials destroyed,.
and amo-jg other articles, the tigubes, with
which he was printing the tables of lo
garithms, be'onging to the present volume,
were melted down by the violence of the fire.
As afupply of these could not be immediately
obtained, he was under the necessity of pub
lifting the volume without the'e tables; but
hopes he fiiall be able to publish them with the
next volume which is now in considerable for-
wardnefs.
The Publi flier embraces this opportunity of
exprefTing his grateful acknowledgments to
the generous public, for the very liberal pa
tronage with which his undertaking lias been
honored; at the fame time he takes the li
berty of representing to such of the fubferibers
as are in arrears, the indifpenfible necefGty of
punctuality, both in taking up the volumes as
early as poffib e after publication, and of pay
ing for them when taken. Many of the fub
feribers having got only one, two, three, &c.
volumes, and several volumes remain unpaid.
Thus the work hangs in all its different stages
from the commencement; and though the im
portance of a few dollars may be but a trifle
to the individuals, yet the accumulation of
these triftes unpaid lays the Publiflier under
very serious embarrafTmeot,and depr.iveshim
of the use of many Thoufandsof Dollars which
at this time would be of very eflential service.
For tbefe reasons the Pttblifher finds himfelf
under the ncceflity of recurring to the original
terms of publication, and in future no vo
lumes will be delivered but only to those who
take and pay to the time of publication.
