[Whole No. 531.
The following miscellaneous articles are co-
pied from the American Star.
The National Gazette of France of tlie
sixth, reports, that the curate of the diftrift
of Mleun said at the tribunal "it is time to
inform the people that there is no thie re
ligion but the religion of nature, and that
all the dreams, all the mockeries, with
which the name of religion hag been deco
rated, are but mere talesâno more priests
âwe shall arrive to it at lad.
At the fitting of the Bth, a number of
petitioning priests were admitted; the
mod of them deposited the corals of fa
naticifrr.âmany members of the Conven
tion both priests and bishops followed thia
example.
The Abbe de Sieyes, who hds not been
spoken of a long time, has lately left his
voluntary obfeurity, and following the ex
ample of his colleagues, has renounced
priesthood, and made a donation of a pen
lion of a thousand livres, which was al
lowed him for a number of benefices.
The Convention went in a body to the
late church of Notre Dame, at present
called the Temple of Reasonâthey con
secrated it, and there made a facrifice te
liberty.
There is remarked amongst the Brif
fotins (of whose execution an account has
been already given) a man called Fauchet,
furnamed in the revolution Iron-Mouth, a
great partizan of the Agrarian law, which
he called agre-able law.
Du Chatel, is also distinguished amofigft
them, who, before the sentence of the
king, had himfelf carried sick to the Con
vention, and there deelared, that in hit
sou) and confcienee he could not find LouiÂ«
the 16th guilty.
Lequinio and Lignel write to the Con
vention from Rothfort, " The popular
society of this city has lately propof'd a
philosophical dispute between the priests
and intelligent menânever was the church
so fullâwe spoke firft, and the curate af
ter. The people gave us attention, and
hided at the curate, with his mysteries.
This church has been named the Temple
of Truth."
The deputies of the commune of Ris,
appeared before the Convention and there
declared " They have no more any need
either of gospel or pastor, they will make
a present to the nation of the money these
inutilities cost ; that at the feet of the fta.
tue of Brutus they will become republic
ans, and on his forehead they will read
their duties."
Voltaire has said in his tragedy of Ma
homet :
" There is need of a new gospel â¢ * â¢
" There is need of a new God to awaken
the universe.
At the fitting of the [ft of December,
La Planche, Dumont, and Fouche sent
seventeen trunks full of precious (tones,
gold and silver, coming from the depart
ment of la Nievre. The republicans, who
were the bearers of this offering said, in
the name of their fellow-citizens, that
they despised all this gold, and that they
only wished for bread and iron. They
addedâwe also express our wi(hes for the
suppression of the ministers of the gospel.
The fame Fouche writes to father Du
chene (Hebert, substitute of commune)
" Happily at Nievre there is now neither
poor nor rich."
Dubois Crance, and Gautiers, who
were seen in the preceding news to have
been arretted, are now set free, on the
motion of the Committee of Public Safe
ty. One of them has sent the Conventi
on an important piece ; it was a resolve.
signed by 20,000 Lyonefe, and who by
its being (hown are convi&ed of rebellion.
Their property has been confifcated to
the profit oi the Republic ; Dubois Crance
affirms, that this property amounts to
near 2000 millions.
Amongst the guillotined Briffotins, or
rather destined for it, since he of whom
we speak killed himfelf, there ii remarked
Du Friehe Valaze, the author of the re
port which produced the ast of accufatioq
against Louis XVI.Kellerman who so long kept himfelf in
command in despite of a formal decree
(as did Polvcrel and Santhonax at St. Do
mingo) can no longer hope to save him
felf, since the attempt in which he failed.
With a design to get in favor with the Ja
cobins he Vtrote them a letter, full of his
devotion to their will, wherein he demand
ed of thejn the title of Gtrural bf the Ja
cobins, but this meanness did not succeed,
and the Jacobins crazed him from the lilt
of their members.
Another general, some time since de
poled, and who had the happiness of be
ing forgotten, viz. Luckner, has had the
foolilhnefs to recall his exigence, by re
claiming some pension. He was soon af
ter arretted in the environs of Metz and
con j. cted to Paris.
Congress of the United States.
Houfc of Representatives.
January 30.
In committee of the whole on Mr. Madison's
refutations.
Speech of Mr. Madison.
[continued.]
HE then went into a review of the
a&ual Hate of our commerce, particular
ly in relation to Great Britain ; and of
the several injuries of another fort, which
that nation had fuperadded to her com
mercial reftri&ions.
He repeated w'.iat hp had formerly
maiutaihed, that there was more of reci
procity in the footing of commerce be
tween Great Britain and other countries,
and between other countries and the Uni
ted States. To prove the firft point he
remarked that in some instances G. Bri
tain had treaties with other countries
which defined and stipulated reciprocal
privileges ; in other instances, her restric
tions were counter-vailed by laws impos
ing reftri&ions on her. To prove the se
cond point, he remarked that no other na
tion, with which the United States carried
on commerce, had a navigation adl limi
lar to that of Great Britain.
With refpeft to the intercourfc be
tween the United States and Great Bri
tain, there was, he infilled, a want of re
ciprocity throughout, that mult strike
the mod fuperfieial observer.
In the article of navigation this had
been fufficiently pointed out, and being
admitted on all lides, need not be repeat
ed.
In the trade between the two countries,
our belt llaples, wheat and flour, fi(h and
oil, & salted provisions, whichamo unt to
considerably more than one third of our
exports, were (hut out of her markets ;
whilst all her staples, her woolens, her
cotton-., her manufactures of the metals,
of leather, and of silk, were admitted on
moderate duties, and enjoyed in a man
ner a monopoly of our market.
In the articles of fuperfluity mutually
admitted, there was nothing to compen
sate the inequality in other cases. Our
tobacco paid a tax of 4or 500 per cent,
our rice 53 or 60 per cent, and our manu
factures of every fort would not be admit
ted if we were ever so able to fend them.
On the other hind, her fuperfluities were
received under duties, which in general
did not exceed from leven and an half to
fifteen per eent.
In the Well India trade, besides the
exclusion of our veflels, whild her own
were left free, there were a number of our
productions which were not admitted in
to the market there, whilit our laws re
fufed nothing that wasbrought to the mar
ket here.
He next turned his attention to the in
juries and losses we fuffered in other ref
peits.
As he had not poflefled himfelf of the
evidence, he should, he said, leave it to
those who had, to shew how far the Indi
ans were or were not spurred on to war a
gainll us, by the agents or partisans of G.
Britain. It was a fufficient ground of
complaint, that the polls were wrongful
ly detained ; that the detention had a
baneful influence on the sentiments and
conduft,of the Indians ; and that the sup
plies for their warfare, were derived from
a trade, authorised by the British govern
ment, and protected by the polls which of
right were ours, and ought to be used for
our defence.
He combined this proceeding of G.
Britain, with the lawless feizuie of our
â¼effek under her inftru&ioni of the Bth
of June last, observing, that whilst on
one fide (he violated the laws of rations,"
by cairying on a trade in contraband arti
cles with those at war with us j (he was
on another fide, violating the laws of na
tions, by intercepting our trade with those
at war with her, in articles not contra
band.
The Indian war he observed, co.l us
annually a sum, exceeding by one million,
the sum that would probably be fufficient
for the defence of our frontier, if the
ports were in our hands. The fur trade
Spending on the poits might, he tho't,
be fairly valued at two hundred thousand
dollars mote.
The Algerine depreditions appeared to
have proceeded from the steps taken in pur
suance of the views of the British govern
ment. If they were not immediately
pointed againtt us, it must have been
known that our trade would be the vic
tim. The evil therefore may at lead be
charged to an unfriendly dil'regard of our
interests, if not a poiitive hollility to
them. The pecuniary amount of this
eTil, cannot be rated at less than the ex
pence of the armament proposed as a re
medy. This is itated at 600,000 dollars
for the outfit ; and he did not expect that
the annual expence would average much
less; to which may be added, at a very
low computation, for insurance remaining
after the armament, 200,000 dollars.
The spoliations committed on our neu
tral commerce by Great Britain, mull be
of considerable. though very uncertain a
mount ; and the consequential detriment
to our trade in general from these inter
ruptions and dangers, of a very great,
though equally uncertain amount.
In order to bring both within a fafe es
timate, he said he would state the former
at the limited film of 150,000 dollars,and
the latter at no more than 400,000 dol
lars.
In addition to the foregoing ellimates,
he said there was another item, which,
though of a different chara&er, fell under
a comprehensive view of our situation ;
and being reducible to an amount tolera
bly definite, ought to find a place here.
He referred to the flatement before quot
ed from a report of the Secretary of (late
which (hewed that the loss to the United
States from a dependence on Briti(h bot
toms for the carriage of their produce
was no less annually, in time of war than
3,250,000 dollars, and in war and peace
averaged, no less than 1,392,857 dollars.
Allowing about one tht'rd of this carriage
for the reasonable (hare of Great Britain
(and for reasons formerly derived from
the character of our exports this was a
full (hare) the annual loss from the depen
dence might be called about one million
of dollars.
These calculations he recapitulated
thus : Dollars.
Indian war 1,000,000
Fuit trade
Algerine depredations
Insurance not reduced by the
naval armament
British spoliations
Consequential detriment to
our trade
Dependence on British bot
tomÂ» 0 1,000,000
Total 3,550,000
From this view of things, it was impos
sible to deny, that however prosperous the
United States might be in some refpe&s..
they were in others laboring under viola
tions of their rights and interests, which
demanded the serious attention of the Le
gislature. Besides the unreciprocal foot
ing of their commerce, and the indignities
offered them, it was seen that they were
burdened with an enormous extra expence,
and involved in unjust lodes, amounting to
more than three and a half millions of dol
lars in a year ; a tax nearly equal to the
heavy one they had been obliged to im
pose on themselves.
Having taken this view of our situation,
he proceeded to consider how far a reme
dy wascomprifed in the resolutions before
the committee, by tracing the probable
operation of them, if parted into a law.
[In this stage of his observations, the hour
of adjournment being nearly arrived, he fat
down, with an intimation that the fubjecft
would be renewed.]

THE danger of our being drawn into
the war, has not pafled over. The cloud
is ft ill black, and agitated with the strug
gles of an imprifoncd whirlwind. It may,
in spite of all the efforts we can make to
shun it, burst upon our unsheltered heads.
God forbid ! War would set us afloat
once moreâit would sweep away, like a
torrent, all that ten years Â®f peace have
gathered j yet, dreadful as it would be,
perhaps we ftiall be compelled to face it.
Appearances are to the last degree threat
ening. The sober citizens, the true pa
triots who love their country bell when
they tremble for its fafety, ftiould now
take their post.

The extreme danger to our peace is
obvious. What shall be done ? Nothing
ralhânothing that will bring us a step
nearer to a warânothing that will aggra
vate the danger without affording us any
aid to resist itâno angry measures to in
dulge our own resentments, and to exas
perate those of any foreign nation. Court
peaceâmaintain it as long as it can be
maintained. Even when it (hall be seen
that it must be finally loft, defÂ»r war to
the last, because we may profit by such a
delay to prepare for warâwe may be
gaining strength, while the nations of
Europe are wafting their resources and
their rage. The chance of events is thus
also on our fide. Time hurries on chan
ges of the most unexpected kind, and some
of them may favor our desire for peace,
or our measures for ajuft defence. The
combinations of nations may break to
pieces, and we may be able then to take
high ground for peace or war. Never was
there more need of prudence. It is a
crisis which rashness and intemperate paf
lions may turn to our ruin.

Mr. Fenno,
By publilhing the following, you will
oblige a constant reader.
THE gentleman (if I may be allowed
to call him so) who urged a sailor that fat
in the front of the gallery in the Play
house last evening, to insult a Lady who
fat in one of the fide-boxes, had better
desist from such practices in future
otherwise his name (hall appear in full
length.
Also, some others, who gave fnuff for
the purpose of having it thrown down
into the Pit. Such practices (ifrepeated)
will meet with the resentment due to their
merits, and the names of the party will
be held up to public view.
A Friend to good Order.
March 6, 1794.
From thi Poughkcepjic Journal.
To the Democratic Societies of Kentuc-
ky, Philadelphia and New-York.
I TOO belong to a Society, the hitlory
of which is this. In the year 1775, when
real dangers were at our doors, the free
people of North-America formed a society,
the aÂ£ting committee of which, was called
the Continental Congress ; it did its duty ;
it was patriotically supported, and finilhed
its destination gloriously.
In the year 1788, it was deemed ex
pedient to new model the society ; and it
now consists, of a general, or national
committee, and fifteen fnbordinate ones.
Neither the one or the other, have as yet
betrayed their trulls; but vigilantly and
and properly, pursue measures, which have
secured to the people of this country, a
degree of felicity beyond what often falls
to the lot of humanity. The officers in
the several departments are men, and as
such, may sometimes be mistaken.âAs
yet, no alarming marks of corruption have
been found: but should unwarrantable
ambition, or peculation, be discovered, ei
ther in the primary committee, or in the
smallest department in the remotest corner
of the nation : there is a spirit in the four
millions which would inflantly detest and
punish the tranfgrefior. We want no clubs,
or chimney corner combinations, to {land
centinels for us. Each American is in
himfelf a fortrefs and watchman ; and ill
betides the foe that doubts it.
It is really amusing, to hear little ob
fcnre spots of people, utterly unknown by
the law, talk of crimes and punifhm'nts ;
apeing the Jacobins of France, with whom,
suspicion is proof; and trial, conviflion
and death. If your finances are not too
punv, I would advise you to import a
complete guillotine, with cords for pinion
ing, and a baflcet to receive the heads.
But if this cannot be effe&ed, apply to
the mother [Society of Paris, and they
will undoubtedly with infinite fatisfa&ion,
furnifh you with a model, and ample di
rections how to ufetbat commodious state
machine. They will tell you perhaps,
that beheading Federalists is the present
reigning fafhton in France ; and that it is
too delightful a recreation, not to be
universally enjoyed.
For the Gazette of the United States.
Mr. Fenno,
The " Observer" in your paper of
lad evening, gives a whimsical account of
the remarks made by a gentleman to a la
dy on the performers in the Jealous Wife,
in which the vanity and prejudice of some
Europeans and travellers are well pictured.
This person whose ignorant criticisms the
Observer so justly exposes, is far from be
ing the only one in this City who holds
the fame language.
There are many persons who have been
in Europe or are natives of it, whole ri
diculous desire, to be thought to know and
have seen more than others, induces them
to depreciate every thing on this fide of
the Atlantic. They will tell you with a
wonderful degree of discernment, that
this country is incapable of producing a
finifhed or even a tolerable good A6l or ;
and that filch as aie biouglit here from
London arc the mere ouUaJls of the Com
panies thereânothing more than candle-
JnuJfers and Jlage-Jiverpersâ(this expres
sion, I have very lately heard used more
than once.) I pretend not to a critical
discernment in these matters, nor by any
means to be a perfect judge of Theatrical'
abilitesâvet I will hazard an obf:rva-
SENEX.
A CAUTION.
ORDER,Uon on these vain and ill-natured reflec
tions on Meflrs. IVignell isf Reinacls's
Company.
That this country should be incapable
of producing a good actor, I can scarce
ly believe, when speaking is so great a re
quilite in the completing a linifhed per
former. It is a well known fact, that
there are gentlemen in this country, both
at the bar and in public bodies, that per
haps yield to none in the world as Ora
torsâand, I think scarcely any person
will deny that our pulpit orators are fully
equal, if not superior any to in the uni
verse. If therefore we have produced
such a number of persons in the different
characters of legislators, lawyers, and di
vines, that yield the palm to none, why
could not equal talents for the flage be
found ? With regard to the other, that
no performers of merit ever come to this
country, this must molt certainly be a ve
ry erroneous and falfe opinion, if any re
liance can be placed on the English them
selves. The firft rate judges there, of
Theatrical abilities, have declared, that
Mrs. IVhithck, (who they will hardly de
ny is now here with the New Company,)
was second to no one, except her sister,
Mrs. Siddons, and but one degree inferior
to her; and I believe if real justice was
done them, there are many others who
would receive the fame applause. I have
been told by an Englishman who has fre
quently seen Mr. Chalmers on the stage in
Europe, that he was a very distinguished
and eminent performer there ; as further
proof of which, I beg leave to introduce
an article that appeared in Mr. Brown's
Philadelphia Gazette of lalh evening.
In the Morning Pofl, a London paper of
the 25th of Juiy, we find the following
article :
" The vefTel that was to have failed
with the Theatrical performers last week
for Philadelphia, has put back, and is now
detained in the river. In addition to
Miss Broadhurjl, Mrs. Marjhall, Mrs.
Shaw, &c. Mr. Chalmers is engaged.â
Talents, like his, (hould not be loft to the
Engljh Stageâfor in Tragedy and Come
dy, he has held for the last three years,
the moji di/lingui/bed line of aSing, in the
Theatres Royal of both Ireland and Scot
land. The (hip fails with this enterpri
zing company on Sunday morning."
What then can be 'inferred fiom their
paltry attempts to itnderate the talents
and abilities of the performers Mr. IVig
nell has brought to this country, but a pi
tiful vanity, or incorrigible prejudice, that
will never allow that merit can be found
in any other place, than the (pot from
whence they sprang. And it is sincerely
wished, that the Observer may fulfill his
promise of handling such felf created and
felf-impoitant censors, " without mit
" tens."
A FRIEND TO MERIT.
March 4th, i 794.
For the Gazstts of the United States.
TO THE OBSERVER.
I HAVE given some of your numbers
a cursory reading, without taking much
trouble in considering whether your high
claims to candour wera well founded or
pot.
I nevertheless fufpefted, that as men of
the largest profefiion9, are generally the
lead sincere, you had some covert object
in view, for the accomplishment of which
you were endeavoring to eflablifli a repu
tation for candour to which you had no
jult pretensions, and your fifth number
seems to juftify the suspicion. After giv
ing an account of a conversation which
you fay you " accidentally heard at the
Theatre last evening between a gentleman
and lady," (iffuch a conversation really
happened, you might have said between a
Pây and a Lady) you proceed to remark,
" That the Obferveris in justice bound
to add, that since then, he baa received
information from indisputable authority,
that this company of Players are persons
of irreproachable characters, as men and
women, and as performers many of them
have not left superiors and some not equals
in Europe
That many if not all of them are of
irreproachable characters, and that they
have very great merit on the stage, I am
well fatisfied of, but the aflertion that
" many of them have not left superiors and
fame not equals in Europeis nlmolt too
extravagant to merit a serious refutation,
and would hardly have been made by a
person really po(Telling the candor to
which "c: "-etend,
If " many of them have not left fuperiori
in Europe" it follows, that we have many
performers, any one of whom, is equal to
the iirft performer in Europe! And if
some of them have not left equals in Europe;
it follows, that neither Mrs. Siddons or any
aSor, or actress in any country in Europe is
equal to some of the company of the Nezo
Theatre!
Contrail this with your following re
marks, and endeavour to extricate your
felf from the contradiction into which you
seem to have fallen. You fay " Mrs.
Whitlock's articulation is so perfe&ly just,
her face, her eye, and indeed her whole
attitude and gesticulation* come so near
the model you had feigned to yourfelf, for
an aftrefs, that you must do a violence to
your own fellings not to declare, that altho'
Jhe may not be equal to Mrs. Siddons, yet
(he is so equal to any expectations we had
entertained in America, the feaft of feing
and hearing her on the stage you hope
will be frequently repeated."
So then Mr. Obfervei, while you admit
that Mrs. Whitlock, the heroine of your
eulogium " may not be equal to Mrs. Sid
dons," you would have us believe, that
" some belonging to the New Theatre
have not left their equals in Europe." Be
fore we can do this, you must either fatis
fy us, that Mrs. Whitlock holds but an
inferior rank on the Americali stage, or
that Mrs. Siddons does not live in Europe,
but in Asia, Africa or Americaâlf you
can do neither, you must give over all pre
tensions to candour, or acknowledge that
the fault was in your head, and not in your
heartâlt is Mr. Observer, an old but just
proverb, that " an imprudent friend is the
worst of enemies," and you have so com
pleatly verified it, that if you really wish
to serve the cause you fcem to espouse,
I recommend to you to change your sig
nature, since you will no longer be regard
ed under your prcfent oneâseveral of the
new performers are admirable in Tragedy
as well as in Comedy, and it is really a
pity that you should have Tragedized them
in so tragi-comicul a manner.

A Work, to be entitled,
THE FIRST VOLUME OF
Pcnnfylvania State Trials.
THE want of fufficient information of the
state trials of Great-Britain in the early
periods of that government is now lamented :
Hi herto there hath been but one trial in the
state of Pennsylvania on impeachment :âand
herealfo it is to be regretted, that, being neg
le&ed at the time, the public are now left with
out fufficient information on the fubjefl of that
trial, it is however in this work designed to ref
cuefwhat can be colle&ed thereof from sources
of iudifputaple authority, f 0 that the fame (hall
be preserved from oblivion.
Another impeachment and the second is now
depending. An officer is charged by the late
House of Representatives, who hath for many
years been largely confided in by this ftate,and
hath long b; en at the head of the financial de
partment of the fame, and it imports the citi
zens to know his conduct, and the circumftanccs
which may be brought forward on hi*trial.
In this work the Editor will be careful to
state the facts, as they may be brought forward,
and to lay all the evidence and papers beiore
the public.âWith this viewâ
The following Terms are* refpefifully
submitted to the Public :
I. The Work (hall be printed in oflavo, with a
good type, on fine paper, and delivered to
fubfer ibers at the refpe&ive places where the
fnbfcrrptions arc taken in, as soon as the work
shall be compleaied.
11. As no eonje&ure can well be made, as to
the length of the present trial, the (ize of the
volume cannot be ascertained at this time
But the price (hail not exceed that of fomeof
the latest publications in this city.
111. It will contain all the preliminaries and in
cidental circumstances that may occur during
the trial of John Nicholfon, Esquire, CompÂ°-
troHer-General of this commonwealth, w j,h
theargumentsofcounfel on both fides,together
with the articles of impeachment, and the
pleas and replications at large, the several re
solutions of the two branches of the state Le
gislature, refpefting this impeachment, and
the final decision of the SENATE refpefling
that officer.
To which will be prefixed, as much as can be
colle&ed from authentic documents, of the im
peachment, trial, and aequital of the late Francis
Hopkinfon, Esquire, Judge of the Court of

the late war, never before pnbliffied.
No money will be required before the deli
