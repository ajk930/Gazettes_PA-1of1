Frem the for/going returns at the Cuflom-

I. THAT the entrances of square rin

ports are more numerous in 1793, than
1791 j whereas those in New-York ate
less; the other vessels are not diftinguilh
ed in the Philadelphia return from the
coaflers, so that a comparative view of the
trade is incomplete. The fatal sickness in
Philadelphia the summer pnft, sad the
French ships of war en our coast, and es
pecially in New-York harbor, may have
been causes of these differences in the so-
reign trade.
2. We remark an aftani/hing increase
of the coaftiag trade of New-York ; the
difference between the years 1791 & '793
being no less than 2y'K entrances. Th.;
editor has not malerials for determining

January 16.
In committee 0f the whole, on the report of
the Secretary of State, relative to toe com
mcrciiil ihicrcourfe of this country, ivith so-
rtt~v TJdt:uvs.
Mr. S. Smith after a few introdu&ory
obfei vat ions, said, the objett of the refuta
tion is to lay an extra duty on goods from
powers not in treaty with the United
States. Those duties will operate as a
bounty, fay for calcidation, of 5 per cent,
in favor of those powers with whom we
have a treaty of commerceâtor experience
has (hewn that those nations cannot supply
us on terms so favorable as that with whom
uo treaty exists.
It is a fnbje& then of fair enquiryâ
what advantages we enjoy from those na
tion* (we are in treaty with) to induce
us to grant then* fnch bountyâand what
are the disadvantages which result from
those treaties ?
The United States have a commercial
treaty with France, Holland, Pruflia and
Sweden.
What arc the commercial advantages ?
The advantages in the treaties mod ufeful
to ui aie, that free mips make free goods,
and this is to be reciprocal.
We have seen that this stipulation has
been violated whenever the neceflity of the
cafe (in their opinion) made it ufeful to
France. The disadvantages of those trea
ties are their prizes coming into our.ports,
and their armed vessels cruizing on our
coasts.
It appears then, that we have no ad
vantages given us by those treaties fuffici
ent to induce us to lay a tax of J percent.
011 17 millions of dollars of importations,
from powers not in treaty with us, fay
850,000 dolla- s per annum to ast as a
bounty on the manufactures of the nations
in tleaty.
It then becomes a fubjeft of enquiry,
what injuries have we received from the
powers with whom we have no commer
cial treaty, that should induce us to tax
ourselves, 850,000 dollars per annum to
retaliate on them.
These powers are Spain, Portugal,
Denmark, Ruflia, Hamburgh, Bremen,
and the other iianfe towns, and Great Bri
tain.
Spain has laid a heavy duty on our flour
to e.icoui age her own ; but not more than
on that of other nations. She has also un
dertaken, in alliancc with Great Britain,
to prevent our taking our produce to
Franpe, contrary to the custom in former
wars. It is true, the fame two powers
attempted the fame thing on a former oc
casion. Spain has by a late editt granted
to nations in treaty of commerce, license
to trade to Louisiana, Florida, See. &c.
which immediately excludes us, and this
may be of serious consequence.
The EngliTn will introduce a good mar
ket for tobacco there ; perhaps they may
think it their interest to reduce the duty
or. that article, now 3s. 6d. per pound, to
the lame with ours, which is is. 3d. âor
if we pass these resolutions, make our 6
Js. 6d. and theirs is. 3d.
But Spain takes almofl all their flour,
a great quantity of wheat, corn and lum
ber, beef, pork, fifh, rice, &c. See. from
us, and is our very best customer.
She supplies us with dollars, brandy,
wine, fruits, fait, and silk goods, on fair
terms. Some of thefeare articles which can
not be procured from the powers in treaty,
and ought we to offend her to gratify our
resentment against England ?
Portugal reftifes since our Revolution
to take our flourâin every other refpeft
(lie is among our best friendsâ(he receives
our wheat, corn, lumber and many other
articlesâher late conduct calls for our fin
cerr.ft gratitude.
She supplies us with wine, falt,fomeEaft-
India goods, lemons, &c. &c.
Why fiiould we declare commercial war
against such a friend ?
The immediate relations with Denmark
are encreafing daily, and on fair termsâ
111 her islands we have the faireft inter
course. Our flour, meal, corn, lumber,
beef, pork, and fi(h, are received there in
our own bottoms, and we bring from
thence all their produce.âTheir children
are educated among us, form friendfhips,
and matrimonial connexions.
Why (hould we declare a commercial
war apsinft a power so friendly ?
Russia affords us iron, hemp, fail-duck,
fln*etiogs, aud feme other articlesâadmits
to into her ports on fair terms, and leavei
to us the whole carrying trade between
the two countries. âWhat cause have tve
to tax her commodities ? She has done ao
thing to offend usâseems well difpofecâ
and many of her articles can be had no
where else ; and it ought to be coniidered,
(he can support the armed neutrality.
Hamburgh and Bremen receive our ves
sels with every poflible mark of friendfhip
âthey take great quantities of tobacco,
rice,, deerskins, furs, and a surplus of our
imports from the Weft Indies ; they sup
ply us with glass, German oznabrigs, and
other German linens ; on mucli better terms
than any other country. What injury
have those republics done us, that we
(hould throw their trade into the lap of
Holland, where we generally pay 5 to 10
per cent more than we pay in these ports.
I come now said Mr. Smith, to the
great Humbling block, Great Britain, a
gainll whom these resolutions point, and
whose political conduct has been the fruit
ful topic of so much declamation.
He concurred in opinion with those who
had severely reprobated the conduct of
their piratical privateers towards our navi
gationâbut are those good reasons, said
he, why we should commence a commer
cial war with more than one half the Eu
ropean nations, or even with her, unless
we shall find it greatly to our intereit. Al
terations of commercical systems require
time and much delicacy in effe&ing. We
do not at present know what will be the
result of proper remonstrances against the
injuries we have fuffered ? Has Great Bri
tain laid any reftri&ions on our commerce
which are not fimilarto those (he lays on
other foreign nations ? I believe not.
Have we any advantages in her ports
over other foreigners ? I believe we have.
Our citizens go there, commence and
pursue trade, without being fubjcct to the
Alien duty paid by other foreigners.
Our tobacco pays 1/3 per lb. duty, when
all other pays 3/6 per lb.
Our pot and pearl afhesarefree ; others
pay 2f per cwt.âwhich is equal to the
freight.
Our naval stores pay less duty than ci
thers pay, which acting at a bounty to ui
enables us to fend thefc bulky articles to
such a distance.
Some of our wood is in the fame situa
tion.
The exportation of our lumber on these
advantageous terms, is particularly bene
ficial to, and promotive of our (hipping.
A cargo of lumber which costs not more
than 400 or 500 pounds would fell for 12
or 1400.
Mr. Smith observed that he presumed
no one would tax him with being preju
diced in favor of Great Britain ; he had
fuffered by them severely, he had fought
againll their usurpations, and (hould his
duty call him, he trusted he (hould not
heiitate to do so again. It is not what
Britain may fuffer by the system proposed,
but the disadvantage which will be the
consequence to the United States, that
ought to be taken into consideration. Our
duty is not to injure others, but to pro
tect our own interest.
Mr. Smith then enquired,
What have we done to benefit our own
commerce ?
In the firft. Congrefs,a duty of 50 cents
on foreign tonnage, and 6 cents on our
own, gave an advantage of 44 cents in
our favour ; and put us more than on a
footing with the extra light money of 1/9
fterl. a ton on onr velfels, charged in all
their parts, except London.
We also laid a duty of i-ioth extraon
goods by foreign veflelsâwhat has been
its consequence.
A gentleman from Virginia, ftatedthat
in 1660, Great Britain pafled their navi
gation ast, when the foreign trade was
1-4 th of the whole, in 1770 it was leffen
edto 1-6 th.
What is the consequence of our law ?
The foreign tonnage in 1770, was
nearly 1-3 dof the whole.
In 1792, the foreign tonnage was re
duced nearly to i-4th or as 244 to 568.
ThiÂ« being the cafe, we have by ourexif
ting laws and industry decreased this pro
portion of the foreign tonnage 1 -6thâ
thus has our existing laws done nearly as
much in 2 years for us, as the navigation
laws of Great Britain did for them in 40
years.
Under the existing state of things, Mr.
Smith said, he could not fee the policy of
pulhing regulations to accelerate a progress
already without example.
The fame gentleman said, that the ma
nufactures of Great Britain amount to j 1
millions, and that the proportion to Ame-
Rica, is 1 millionsâfay 4 per cent of the
exports of that country : will she give up
her navigation ad for the profits of 4 per
cent on her exports ? Can it be expected
that (he will deviate from a system which
more than 100 years experience has con
firmed the utility of.
With refped to France, Mr. Smith ac
knowledged in warm terms, the obligati
ons this country was under to that, for
the services rendered during the Â«var. â
France, said he, will be a republic, and as
republicans, they will treat with us on fair
liberal, and reciprocal terms.
Mr. Smith concluded by reading the
following comparative statement:â
England.

ult. informs, that the French, to make a
diversion in favor of the grand army com
manded by General Jourdon, made a
grand attack on the whole cordon, of the
allied forces, from Tournay to the sea.
Early on the morning of the Z2d ult. a
column of French troops, fiom fix to se
ven thousand strong, composed partly of
the garrison of Dunkirk and of the troops
which occupied the entrenched camp of
Gyvelde, advanced towards Funics, with
a tram of heavy cannon and mortars, with
an intention to force that place: The
garrison amounting to upwards of two
thousand men, composed of Auftrians,
Hessians, and French emigrants, marched
out in order of battle to engage the ene
my, and a bloody action commenccd, in
which both parties often had recourse to
the deilrwftive bayonet; but, after the
greatest efforts of bravery, the allied for
ces were forced to yield to the superior
numbers of the French who entered pell
mell with them into Furnes, in the streets
of which place they again /ought for some
time. Our troops, surrounded on all
fides, succeeded in forcing their way thro'
the enemy's battalions, and made their
retreat to Nieuport, though continually
harraffed. The French, elated by this
advantage, immediately marched against
Nieuport, with some pieces of heavy can
non and four mortars. General Hoche,
who commanded the French on this ex
pedition, sent the following remarkable
summons to the inhabitants of Nieupoit
â" I summon you to surrender immedi
ately to the arms of the French Republic,
before which all (horJd yield; and I re
quire that lix hostages, the most eminent
persons in your city, mltantly give them
selves up at my camp; otherwise, sur
rounded, attacked by sea and land, your
city will be destroyed ; I will enter on the
fmoaking ruins of your hoiifes and the
panting wrecks of your numbers: Let
the example of Furnes teach you not to
depend on your defenders, who calumni
ate because we beat them." Tin magis
trates of Nieuport, not terrified at rodo
montade, simply answered, that it was to
the military commandant he Ihould have
addrelTed himfelf, and not to them. On
this refufal, the French began to throw
in (hells and bullets, which much dama
ged the city : Then the garrison determi
ned to open the sluices and inundate the
surrounding country, which they did with
such success, that the enemy were obliged
to retire with precipitation that they had
not time to carry off two twenty-four
pounders which they planted in a batte
ry. In the mean time, on the firft intel
ligence of this invasion which reached
Oftend, four English regiments, who were
ready to embark, and a part of the gar
rison, made a movement to succour Nieu
port.
America.
A second column of French advanced
against our posts at Werwyek and Mou
corn, which theyattacked with the great eft
vivacity ; After a most murdering engage
ment, our troops retreated, abandoning
some pieces of dismounted cannon. The
enemy entered Menin on the 23d of Oft.
and the garrison retired to Wevelghem,
by the Icontrary road, where thev were
attacked on the 24th, b"' f u ' ; h 4
vigorous defjace as obliged the French to
retire.
While this palled toward* Weft-Flan
ders, the French, who occupied the camp
of La Magdelaine, under Lisle, advanced
with a large train of artillery towards De
nain, MarchiennÂ«s, and Orchies, which
they attacked very brifldy at the fame
time : They were repu'.fed every where
but at Marchiennes, which they got pof
fefiion of; but the allied troops, encamp
ed at Ciofing,having advanced on the ene
my, a most bloody battle commenced,
which ended in the precipetate retreat of
the French, whom our troops pursued for
a considerable time. We have no certain
accounts of the lofTes sustained by both
parties in three different engagements;
but we know, positively, that the enemy
have severely fuffered, and that, on our
fide, we have also 101 l many men.
As soon as our Generals received advice
of the enemy's progress in Flandeis, the
Duke of York?at the head of the English
army, advanced by party marches to the
relief of that part of our frontier.
Whale they fought so obstinately in
Flanders, our troops in Hainult weie not
less active. General Jourdon having (hewn
by his movements that he projected an en
terprize against Quefnoy, the Prince of
Sax Cobourg advanced, on that fide, to
watch the enemy, and eftablilhed his head
quarters at Bermerain. On the 23d, Ge
neral Ferrand left Maubeuge, at the head
of fix thousand men, with a design to at
tack the wood of Tileul, where our troops
held several important polls. On this oc
casion a very long and obstinate battle w?s
fought, the victory was long doubtful, but
at last the French were rcpulfed with
great loli ; ours was not considerable.
Yesterday morning a courier arrived
here, who brings intelligence of a great
advantage being gained by General Clair
fait, over a body of French troops, who
were furroundcd in the sorest of Boucluiu.It appsars that thÂ«r enemy have loft their
artillery, and that Clairfait has taken a
great number of prisoners. We expect
further accounts of this new affair.
Some perions ha7e been lately arretted
at Gartd, who are known to be connect

tending to excite popular tumults. Others

and more than indecent joy, for the cruel
death of the Queen of France ; which

" On Monday lajl, agreeably to notice,
the Books for the fubfeription of Jhares in
the Columbia Bank were opened. More
than double the number of /hares permitted by
the law to be taken, were demanded. Of
eonrfe, a reduction became necessary. Subscrib

the rejl were curtaded, the great,jl proportion
being taken from the largefl fubferiptions.â
The bii/inefs was ft conduced as to afford,
Bttwihjlanding the disappointments, general
fitisfaSion. The large/! number of Jhares
taken by one of the gentlmen appointed to re
ceive fubferiptions, is 120. To the honor of
the inhabitants of this town, they were re-
Jlrained, by considerations oj delicacy, from
engaging in any kind of speculation upon the
fubjeti ; though it was evident that they might
have done so to great advantage. The great
bulk of tlx Jhares was taken by those who
mean to hold them and not to fell ; and a

Last evening-arrived in town, Colonel

By Col. Oswald we learn, that twenty

Extract of a letter from Angufta, Georgia,
December 11
" On Saturday we received the joyous
confirmed accounts of the general defeat
of the several divifionsof combined despots
against the only real Republicans in the
world. On this continent we have been
taught to believe, that our constitution
breathes more than freedom itfelf, but
when I compare it with that of the French,
I find v.'e arc rtiackled with nearly a 6 much
aristocracy as when under the slavish chains
of British tyranny. To-morrow we are
to hare an ox killed and barbecued on the
common ; the governor gives powder to
fire a feu dejuyr ; no person shall be at it,
but those who are real friends to the re
public of France ; nor dare a fellow who
has been hardy enough to pollute freedom,
or abuse its cause, approach the sacred
ground. A notification to that effect will
be handed round, although there are not
more than twenty such above the line
of Â»
" We are informed, fays a correspond
ent, that the class of citizens" who have
petitioned against the stage, are in no de
gree displeased with the comparison ialti
tuted in this paper of lalt evening, between
the Theatre and Swine. On the contrary,
they think, that, as the things compared
are evidently some of the dirtiefi and mojl
filthy in nature, the simile is peculiarly
happy, so far as this point of refemblahce
is concerned : And they are confident that
the public will remark that there iÂ» not a
shadow of likeness in any thing beside ; be
cause the position from which it would a
riseâ" that the Theatre is not incompa
tible with the good order of society"âis
begged ; âand that it has been begged and
legged, till no body but a Jlurdy lieggar
would haTe the face to beg it any more.

The Carmagnoles that hefieged Nieu

was at iirtt apprehended. The chief at
tack was on the 25th nit. It commenced
at 7 in the morning, and continued till
night. Ihe artillery from our ramparts
did great execution ; the vny firil aif
eharge set iire to a hrew-houfe and (table,
behind which the French had entrenched
themfclven, and it was speedily reduced to
allies.
1 lie !ofs of the republicans cannot be
nfeertained, at they carried off their killed
and wounded, a few excepted, whom they
left upon the ground.
The four 24 pounders and two howitz

with a vafl quantity of (hot and balls, are
now in the square at Nieuport. The enemy
luffered much from 5 (hips of war, which

LONDON, Nov. 7,
The city of Florenzo in the island of
Corlica, is now besieged by five ships of
Lord Hood's squadron on the sea, and by
Gen. Paoli on the land fide. It is meant
to be flarved into a surrender.
The grand total of prisoners, in the
different goals of Paris, amounted on the
24th ult. to 3042.
In the proceedings of the National
Convention, so late down as OA. 27, it is
stated that the Royalists of La Vendee,
far from being exterminated, have jjained
advantages over the republicans, and have
the city of Laval.
By authentic accounts from Frankfort
of the 28th, wc learu that the allied pow
ers had taken pofleflion of Alsace in the
name of his most Christian Majesty Louis
XVII.
The report of the surrender of I.andau
is not founded. The garrison of the for
trefs sent a trumpeter, offering to capitu
late. They demanded, bcfidcs a free re
treat, other conditions, similar to the
garrison of Mentz, but this was refufed.
Fort Louis also wanted to capitulate ;
but the allies answered the patriots, that
they mult surrender at difcrction. The
lattci- place is bombarded daily.
From Rreft wt learn, that 2 ilujn Lr
longingto the Toulon named Be
Patrjote, and J.'Entreprcnant, of 74
guns each, commanded by Danvctte and
liourhone, arrived at that place on Wo
ihe 25th ult. 'iney had be.;o dilpatchcd
thither, it is said by Lord Hood,:or ionic
fccret icrviccs.
The national commifiioners, apprch en
five of some treachery, forbid all commu
nications with them, and ordered the com
manders and officers to be imnicdidtcly
arretted. They are to be sent to Pai
for examination.
Accounts from Havre, dated Oftobir

the town, and the military force had been
confidcrably augmented.

was in the highest health and spirits. The
Prince of w:s doing his
utmolt to bring the French to a
adlion, which there were some hopes of
his being able to acccmpiifh.
Ihe Prince of Cobourg's Head Quar
ters are at Solefms, behind Fandrecis. The
corps which he has left at Bav*>y and at
Barlamount, to oblervc the French on the
other fide of the Sambre, is commanded
by General Clairfait. Another corps is
placed on the right fide of the Sambre,
towards the Somme. This pohtion has
the double advantage, to intercept the
convoys that might be forwarded from
Lisle and Douay to the grand army, and
to prevent General Jourdain from fc;id:t:i
affiftance ro the places in Weft Handets
that may be attacked by the Allies.
It is thought, that in conkquence of
this difpoiition, the Duke of Yoric m now
marching to attack the camp of Cadet
at prtfent reduced to 8,000 men, sad
which cannot receive succours from the
grand Frencli army without General Jour

VOLUME X. OF
Encyclopedia; or Dictionary
Of A ts, Sciences, and Mil'ceilaneous
Literature, on a Plan entirely new ;
Br which
The iXiflerent Sciences nnd Arts >
are digejled into the form of
Diftintft Treaties or Syflrems :
THIS volume contains principles of Levels,
Liberty, Do&rine of Light, Lightning,
Locks, Logarithms, Logic, History of Lon
don, Longitude, Luther, Lydia, Macedon,
Madagascar, Magic, Magnetism, Malts, His
tory of Man, Marriage, Mary, Maryland,
Masonry, Materia Medica, Meadow, Mecha
nics, with a great variety of Biographical a.od
Miscellaneous articles, illuilrated with Twew
ty Two Copperplates.
As a number ol families are still in the
country, and it is not generally known who
arereturned. T. Dobfon, solicits the favor
of the subscribers to call or fend for their vo
lume?, that they may be supplied as early as
poifible.
The TiNri volume of the Encyclopedia is
now presented to the public ; but as it makes
its appearance in an imperfed state, some ac
count of the reason of that imperfection should
be i2,iven. On the Bth of September last, the
Publisher had the misfortune of having his
Printing Office burnt down by a fire which
broke out in the neighbourhood, and a great
quantity of his printing materials destroyed,
and among other articles, the figures, with
which he was printing the tables or lo
garithms, belonging to the present volume,
were melted down by the violence of the fire.
As a supply of these could not be immediately
obtained, he was under the necefllty of pub
lifliing the volume without these taeles; but
hopes he shall be able to publish them with the
next volume which is now in considerable for-
wardnefs.
The Publi flier embraces this opportunity of
expressing his grateful acknowledgments to
the generous public, for the very liberal pa
tronage with which his undertaking has been
honored; at the fame time be takes the li
berty of representing to such-os tire subscribers
as are in arrears, the indifpenfible necefllty of
punctuality, both in taking up the volumei as
early as poflib.e after publication, and of pay
ing for them when taken. Many of the sub
scribers having got only one, two, three, &t.
volumes, and several volumes remain unpaid.
Thus the work hangs in all its different stages
from the commencement; and though the im
portance of a few dollars may be but a trifle
to the individuals, yet the accumulation of
these trifles unpaid lays the Publiflier under
very serious embarrafTinent, and deprives him
of the use of many Thoufandsnf Dollars which
at this time would be of very efTential service.
For tUefe reason* the Publisher finds himfelf
under the necefllty of recurring to the original
terms of publication, and in future no vo
lumes will be delivered but only to thole who
take and pay to the time of publication.
