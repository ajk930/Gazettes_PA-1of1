DREADFUL ACCIDENT.
Monday night the Royal family went to
the little Hay Market Theatre for the firft
time this season. A most afflicting scene oc
curred at the opening of the doors. The
expectation of their Majesties' presence drew
the atfual crowd, and on opening the doors,
the torrent broke in with impetueffity. At
the ejitry of the theatre there is an ill con
trived delcendmg fta'ir, to the pitt; on. which
some of the foremoft of the multitude loft
their feet and fell; the crowd prefled over
them with that thoughtleTs fury. which 'in
such a moment no companion can touch, ri6
eloquence foften. Out readers will hear it
with horror! in shis way, seventeen human
beings ZLx'rr troddeti â to death !ex el "olive of
thoie, who being recovered from the effeil*
of fuffocation, are scarcely expected to sur
vive the bruises which they ftfftained tinder
â  *he preflure of the eagsr, unthinking crowd,
whose sympathy was extinguished in their
curiolity. The .ronfufipn lasted for h,alf 29
hour, and for all that time no possible aid
could be given to the victims. As soon as
possible the bodies were carried to the ad
joining houses j seven of tfiern to Mr. Win
ches* the druggist, two or three of them to
Meflrs. Longman and Broderip's, and thfe
Tell to other houses in the neighbourhood,
where all the means recommended by the
Humane Society were tried to restore anima
tion in vain. But one person out of all the
vidtims were recovered. Several of them
were immediately recognized as hsving lived
in the neighbourhood, and nine were taken
to St. Martin's work house, where four of
them were owned ; five still remain there
whole names are unknown.
The accident did not interrupt the per
formance ; the hoilfe was quite crowded with
the Beau Mon ,'e, and the pieces went off
with great laughte; and apphirfe. It was
ftid the (hocking event was not made.known
to their Majesties till next rttorning.
The following is a lift of the dead, as ac

United States, 16th April 1794-
Gentleman of the Senate,
The communications which I have made
to you during your present fefiion, from the
dispatches or our Minister in London, con
tain a serious aspect of our affairs with
Great Britain. But as peice ought to be
pursued with unremitted zeal, before the
1 . lift resource, which has so often been the
scourge of nations, and cannot fail to check
the advanced prolperity ot the United States,
is contemplated, I have thought proper to
nominate, and do hereby nominate JOHN
JAY, as nvoy extraordinary of the United
States, to his Britannic majesty.
My confidence in our Minister Plenipoten
tiary in London continues uhdirtiiniflied. But
a million like this f while it corresponds with
the folemnjty of the occasion, will announce
to the world a solicitude for a friendly ad
justment of our complaints, and a reludlance
to hostility. Going immediately from the
United States, such an envoy will carry with
him a full knowledge of the existing temper
' and sensibility of our country ; and will thus
be taught to vindicate our rights with firm
nefs and to cultivate peace with sincerity..

Irl.Jthe markets of the 25th and 26th, j
there was an entire want of several of the t
indispensable articles of life. Some of 1
the feftions Viade a proclamation by the 1
found of the trumpet, inviting the citi- i
zens to leave the butcher's meat for the
sick, women in child-bed, and wet-nurses.
Under the old regimen, more than half
the kingdom was supported by fill' du
ring Lent, according to the rites of the
ci-devant religion. Now, when an at
tempt is made to introduce a conformity
to this regulation, it is found to be im
-1 poflible, because the peasants, from the
very commencement of the resolution,
[ having been allowed to cut through the
| banks of the ponds and lakes, these have
no longer been kept up, and the fifh, that
abundant source of fupply> is confequent
[ ly deltroyed. This deficiency must be
1 supplied by meat, and this becomes one of
the many causes of the present scarcity.
In an address presented to the Com
munes the Section of Indivisibility has
made the following statement refpefting
the situation of the prisons :
" The prisons are 110 other than so ma
ny pleasurable residences. Choice enter
tainments, the moil exquisite food, deli
cious wines, music, concerts, plays, pro
menades, suspicious aflemjilages, unlawful
conversationsâsuch are the enjoyments
and amusements of the prisoners. 1 hey
have even contrived to convey into the
jails, cattle, game, tame fowls, &c. It
is for them alone, that the nourishing ani
mal sheds his blood, while the Sans Cu
lottes, who, with their own blood have
cemented the basis of our Holy Liberty,
can obtain these articles of support at no
price whatever, or if they do procure
them now and then, it is not until the
trader, as counter revolutionary as our o
pen enemies, has insolently complained of
the maximum. To these good people the
butcher's lhops are (hut. The pork-fel
ler has no longer any meat to dispose of;
the grocers have neither oil nor sugar;
nor do the cows, as heretofore, supply
milk for use, or for the making of buU
ter; the hens have ceased to lay their
eggs ; and, finally, the earth no longer
yields up her fruits and her productions."
The Administration of Police is accu
sed of (haring in, and tolerating these a
buses. t
The Section of Indivisibility followed v
â  up its address by a refolnticn to demand t
â¢ of thi Convention, the transportation <:
out of Paris of those imprisoned on sus
picion ; the sequestration of their effects
till two years after peace; and a prohibi
tion against any one entering the houses . r
in which they are to be confined in the ,
provinces, or corresponding with them. {
After the fequeftra,tion of their goods and
Revenues, the Section proposed that they
ihould have three livres a day for their ]
support, and ihould have but one com- (
man lodging with the indigent persons t
who might be confined in the fame hou
ses.
The Section also proposed, that the
Municipality or Administrators of Sup
ply lhall furnifh the cattle and other ani
mals to the butchers, poulterers, &c. wjio
(hall be allowed to fell no more than half i
a pound of flefh daily to each citizen, who ]
for that effect is to be provided by the
committees with a certificate, as in the
cafe of bread, &c.
Tin's business being ended, a long dif-
I cuffion arose during which it was obser
ved, that for upwards of four months
the Police had not granted permiflion to
any one to visit those who are imprisoned
I on suspicion ; and that for several days,
not one ounce of meat had been carried
to the prisons, unless for the sick.
March 3.
The scarcity of meat, butter, vegeta
) bles, &c. is (till the fame at Paris ; a
calf's caul fells for 20 livres, and a capon,
on the 27th of last month, fold for 47
livres ; a great quantity of rotten poul
try has again been thrown into the river.
1 A letter was received from one of the
1 Administrators of Rochelle, dated the
19th of February, stating that the 11a

fallen into the power of the rebels.

Addresses, out of all number, are daily
handed to the convention, praying it not
to lilten to terms of pet.ee, till all the ty
rants of the earth have bit the dust. The
moll remarkable is that from Rochelhr,
which contains the following paflage:
Â« Let us place Kings in the lb.te we
are inâlet us ftippofe them to have been -
favoured by victory ; we aik the Univerft,
would those despots have thought to have^
ever fned blood enough to alfuage their

thage for usâand let tiumphant Liberty
inferibe in her records the united names of
England and France. "
Roufin denounced a new faction in the
Convention,' which, he said, was worse
i than the Briflotine party ; and denounced
Philippeaux asan oppreftbr of the Patriots.
The Cordeliers then took the resolution
to appoint Commiflioners to collect the
different charges against the new faction,
and to read their names in its iittings.

But, what of more eonfequence to
their cause, they have succeeded in procu
ring an aimed neutrality. Switzerland,
Denmark, Sweden, and Venice, have
entered into a negociation for maintain
ing the rights of nations; and to this
confederacy they, have invited America,
Floieuce, Genoa, and all other Itates who
have been threatened, a3 well as those
now at war, wbo have been forced to

Commodore Elphinjton, who was ap

one of them is the Commerce. de Mar

There are French papers in this town
of the 27th. By these it appears, that
the Royalists have, since the former ac
counts 111 the convention, gained some con
siderable advantages over the forces ot the
ar.archifts. There is reason to believe,
that dilcontent and despair are the general
{enfations of the people of Paris.
In-fait, the R yalifts in Brittany, who
have been so often extirpated by the nati
onal convention tits, and have as often risen
from the dead, are at this moment in as
great force as they were at any period of
the lad year; and it now appears, that the
chiefs of that party have been actively,
tab' with fxrecy, employed all the win
ter mo uhs, to collect a very formidable
force against the opening of the campaign ;
and such as will induce our government to
lend them fuccoura. The Royalists are
now attempting to gain some port, vVhere
our troops miy land with faiety; and
Lord Moira is arrived at Jerfev, in order
to be on the spot to receive the speediest
intelligence from them. Government has,
there is reason to believe, the mod certain
information, of the ftrtngth of their force,
which promises the moil important advan
tages. The whole country of the Bas
Limofin is in aims against the convention;
and by private letters we know, that M
4e Precy, who commanded the Royalists
at Lyons, and.- retired to RovCrgue after
the evacuation of thffÂ£ city, is now in the
Bas L'moun country, at the head of 6000
men, an.! is making the best of his way to J

Several Engliih men of. war entered the

directed their fire upon some adjacent

troops, whorn they brought with them,
at a place called Parailo, at the diitarice
of four Italian miles from Fort Morafella.
This latter fort being immediately attack

re'iftance of two days. . Soon after," the
Britiib troops joined by some of the Cor
ficaus, went to attack another fort, called
Fornali, the iflue of which expedition has
not yet transpired. At the fame time a

On Sunday night, about midnight, his

Brull'cl's gazette is the creature of a court, &
10 is the General Advertiser ! the Brufiel'i
gazette strives to give the people the rank of
twine, and so does the General Advertiser.
How apt then the comparison. But what
charaft v is to be given to the paper that
contains this eulogium ? The gazette of the
United States is the paragon of excellenceâ

Charlotte, a tale of Truth,
In two volumes.
By Mrs. ROWSON, of the New Theatre,
Phlade phia, Author of Victoria, the InÂ«
quifitor, the Fille de Chambre, &c.
Of Charlotte, the Reviewers have given
' the following character.
IT ma) be a Tale ol' Ttuth, for it is not
unnatural, ana it is a talc of real diltrefs.â
Charlotte, by the artifice oÂ£a teacher, recom
mended to a school, from hnmanity rather
than a eonviflion of her integrity, or the re
gularity of her former conduct, is enticed
from her gover. efs,and accompanies a young
officer to America.âThe marriage ceremo
ny, if not forgotten, is postponed, and (Char
lotte dies a martyr to the inconstancy of her '
lover, and treachery of his friend âThe situ
ations are artless and affe&ingâthe descrip
tions natural and pathetic; we should feel
for Charlotte is.such a person ever existed,
who for one error scarcely, perhaps, deserved
so severe a punifhinent. If it is a fiction,
poetic justice is not, we think, properly dis
tributed.

The Public are cautioned, to
beware of counterfeited Five Dollar Bills ef

'within a few days past ; they are a good ge

be distinguished .by the following
mark S.
Five Dollar Bills of the Batik of the
United States.
ALL that have Â«ppearfcd have the letter F
for their Alphabetical Mark. ' t
The Texture of the Paper is thicker and
whiter anfl it take-, the ink more freely than

so that a line extended from the top of ihe'o'
to touch the tap of the M. would extend cor.'
fiderably above the range of the whole word"
In the word United the letters are narrow*
erand closer together than the reft of the bill"
The i and /in the word promise are not
parallel, the f inclining much more iorwaiJ

ALL that have appeared have the letter
IS- >or their alphabetical mark.
They are printed o t a paper nearly fi m i| ar
to that of tlie couuterfeit Five Dollar Notes
above d.-fenbed; the engraving is beUei exe
ucted, and they approach nearer to the ao
pe;u ance of the genuine bills.
The fine ruled lines through llle word Twcn
t\, 111 Cue body ot the bill, are in number thir
teen in the genuine b Us, and but twelve in
the counterfeit s.
The word Company is'much like the fame
void in the Five Dollar B lls as defer ibed a
bove, the o being lefsihau the m, and ..then

There in no stroke to the t inilifc word North
wheels in tha genuine bills the flroke is well
