UNITED STATES.
NEW-YORK, March 2Z.
Â£jxtraÂ£t of a letter from Albany,
March 14.
" I informed you some time since, that
the Senate has patted a bill for fortifying
New-York, with money out of our Irea
fury, in full confidence that Congrefj
would repay us. After much time i'pent
thereon, the bill was rejected by the As
sembly on the principle, that it was the
duty of the United States, aiid that it was
unconllitutional for us to take up this bu-
finefs.
" On a fuggeflion that the United
States would fortify our port, but that
their means were inadequate ; Mr. North
next morning brought in a bill for loaning
nioney to the United States, for the pur
pose of fecurirtgand fortifying New-York.
It is probable it will pass in the Alfembly,
and there is good hopes it will succeed ir\
the Senate.
" The bill for providing field artillery,
arms, accoutrements and ammunition, for
the life of the militia of this state, bro't
in some days since, by the fame gentleman
was after much debate, passed yesterday
by the alfembly. and 7 J, 000 dollars ap
propriated for these objects. Mr. Mat
thewr- Clarkfon, James Watson, and Ben
jamin Walker, aie appointed commission
ers for making purchales, disposing, &c.
under the direction of the Governor.â
The artillery, arms, &c. are to be I'epo
fited in the four great diilriÂ£ts, and left
fubjeft to the orders of the commander
in chief, Until further legislative provision
(hall be made.
" This bill is of such confluence to
the state that there is no doubt of its paf
iiug the Senate; perhaps they may not be
sb liberal, and perhaps thiy may try to
put in other commiffionera, not because
those already nominated, art not perfedt
ly good and proper, but because they are
not of the right party,
or j
" The Legislature have an immensity
of business yet before them> and if they
remain here until the public objects only
are gone through, they will not rife till
the middle of April."
We find by accounts from Europe and
the Weft Indies that the present war is as
suming a most ferocious afpeft. The in
veterate hatred that subsists between the
belligerent nations is calling forth every
malignant passion, and barbarism marks
the progress of the contest. The unparal
leled depredations on commerce by the
British nation, has provoked univerlal in
dignation : and the mysterious detention
of neutral vessels in the French ports, and
the violent seizure and sale of their cargoes
at half the firft'eoft, by the comeniffioners,
is a proceeding, not to be accounted for
on any principle of pol'cy. One woulc'j
think that the nations at war are deter
mined, in venting their fury at each other,
to commence pirates and plunder all na
tions. Indeed what is thrir conduit but
universal piracy ! It seems as though they
were treading back the ftepscf civilization
and haltening to the savage state of the
9th and 10th ctnturies, wlien the feawas
covered with roving coifairs from Norway
and the Baltic. .

Lift week failed from this port the (hip
La Ville de l'Orient, of twenty four nine
pounders, and Monday Le Republican, of
eighteen fix pounders. These (hips have on
board upwards of 7000 barrels of flour, and
are to join the fleet in Chcfaptak.
A correspondent informs, (fays the Ame
rican Daily Advertiser) that about 18 days
ago, the cargo of a prize to the Sans Pareil,
was publicly fold in Charleston. The prize
was freighted at New-Providence, by the
Britilh Governor, and bound to Augustine.
Her cargo consisted of paint, blankets, gorg
ets, bracelets, and other ornaments, for In
dians. Addid to these, was a very consider
able quantity of scalping knives, mulkets,
and tomahawks!CONGRESS

Wednesday, Jartuary 29,
The S PbECH of Mr. Smith, of South'
Carolina, in reply to Mr. M dison, on
the inject tf the Ccto n.rci.il Regulations.
/ [comtinued]
To depreciate the difciimination in our
favor in the Briti/h I (lands by the exclufi
-011 qf the produce of other nations, the
gentleman had laid the exclulion was only
a matter of form and a remnant t>[ the
old colony f\ ft em.
* 'r. 61111 th said this was no answer to
la* 'tw;s a remnant of the colony fy.
stun ' âI hat fyltem aimed at peculiar
privilege* to the national Dominions ; as
far as we, leing foreigners, iliil partake
ol u.olc privileges, 'tis to our advantage;
funpofc under that old fvftem we had
co ntinued to enjoy the right of navigating
to the lfl.uds, wouid it have been a dispa
ragement of the right that it was only a
remnant of the old colony system ? Neither
was it true that.it wasonlv matter of form
auJ of no confluence: though we can
in general (upply the islands better than
othvr nations, it does not,follow that o
thefs could not fujiply at all: The French
coionies could not get flour on as good
teirns as we can furnifh them ; yet that
article was prohibited, and in general
the Britifli colonies could not be supplied
equally well as from us, yet in the years
oi lcarcity in this country, and of plenty
ehewhere, a competition might injure us:
W.iy could not lice in particular be sup
plied from the Porttijuefe dominions in
cc with our's ?
Much reliance had been placed by the
gentleman on the disproportion of Ame
ric.rri and Britiih tonnage employed in the
commerce between the two countries } he
hal dated that in 1790 the British ton
n; was 211,000 the American only
4-â¢ Â»COC : But Mr. Smith observed the
cc:npÂ»rifon was not accurate: the rule
p:.; fired by the gentleman was entry, not
real tonnage : and as we have no direst
tonnage with the Britidi Welt-Indies,
from which entries, are frequent, the Bri
(''â  'â¢ tonnage is swelled by that frequency
of entries, as happened in the cafe of the
Anerican tonnage employed between the
B; tithand French dominions. The house
hiving no materials before them, it was
in;poffible to pronounce how far this eir
ci:',flthnce varied the true proportion, but
it was easy to fee that it mud do it greatly!
Arguments had been-likewife drawn
from the greater pi oportion of onr tort
nage employed in our trade with Spain,
Portugal, &c.-
Mr. Smith thought the principle of
co.r.'pariion was a proof of nothing, ex-
that Britain was a more navigatrng
poxier than the nations in general with
whom we have commerce : It Was no teji
ot the fyitem of either. Tin's was evi
dent when we compared the proportion
of our tonnage with Britain, and with
Spain and Portugal, for as the latter e
qually Vith Biita'n excluded us from their
colonies, their !y (terns were eflentially the
farre : But Britain has extensive means of
navigation, Spain and Portugal slender
ntcaiis, so that while our bottoms were the
principal carriers between those countries
and us, Britain maintained a competition
wi'rtrus in the trade between her domini
on â  and us. But^could it be proved that
this was either avoidable in the present
clrcumdances of the country, or that we
oifght to attempt to avoid it by violent or
farced expedients. The navigating dates,
in the European trade between the Britiih
dominions and the United States, prepon
derate greatly in the article of tonnage ;
Great Britain may have the advantage in
the rton-naWgating dates ; this arises, in
a great degree, from a cause which navi.
gation laws cannot enreâthe fujpeiiority
of capital. The merchants of Britain
can supply on long credits, what those of our
navigating dates cannot; they have more
mam to purehafe' and export the commo
dii ieÂ» of the south ; from both causes they
carry on a confldera'ole part of "the south
ern trade, and they make their own (hip.
ping the indrutnent of it. No means cal
culated to multiply our vefTels, can under
exidirrg circumllances, obviate this course
of things. But the remedy of violent
and forced expedients would be pernicious,
if if could be fuccefsful : It would divert
our cap'tal, in too great a degree, from
better to worse bufinefa, from agriculture,
commerce and mauuf.fturcs, to mere na-
ligation. The true conrfe, he thought,
was to fofter our navigation by gradual
and moderate encouragements, and to ex
pert from time and the increase qf refourâ
<â¢Â«, the advantages, of which w<s were so
licitous. In the mean time, and till our
l-efources could b= better matured, it
would be difficult to demonstrate that it
was not a convenience to us'to have the
aid of foreign menns. Mr. Smith, to
strengthen his argument on this point,
quoted a paflage from Mr. JefFerfon's Ut
tfcr to Mr. MOl sis* theminiifer in France,
in the printed con efpondence, page 63,
in these words. " Were the merchant
vessels coming for our produce forbidden
to have any arms for their defence, every
ad v enturer who has a boat, or money e
nough to buy one, would make her a pri
vateer, our co ait would swarm with them,
foreign vessels must cease to come, our com
merce mujl be suppressed, our produce remain
on our hands, or at lea It that great portion
of it, which <we have not vessels to carry a
â¢way, our ploughs mujl be laid aside, and a
griculture fvfpended : This is a facrifice, no
treaty could ever contemplate, and which
we arc not disposed to make out of mere
complaisance to a falfe definition of the
term privateer."
He begged the committee to remark
that this related to a British (hip, and that
they were the principal foreign carriers of
our produce ; yet the tendency of the
gcr.tl, man\s propositions went to exclude
them from our ports.
(Speech to he continued.)

NEW-YORK, March n,
MefTrs. Childs and Swaine,
Please to insert the following extrafl of a
lcttir from a gentleman in Halifax, (N.S.)
to his friend in this city, dated l'ebruary
28, 1-94.
'â¢ Business here is very dull, and I fee no
profpeii of an increase. I Ihould suppose
there mutt be a stagnation of business your
way, owing to tile embarraflinents your* go
vernment is thrown into by" the European
powersâWhat efFea this will finally have
we are at a loss here to conjecture ; your po
litical situation is undoubtedly a critical one ;
I hope you will be enabled to steer clear of
the miseries of war, and at the fame time
preserve an honorable appearance.
" There appears to me to be a very pow
erful combination against the liberties of mart
kind ; and it is not at all surprising that the
system of American government Ihould be
an objefl of general did ike to the enemies of
France* The found of repubhcinifm is fuf
ficient to rouse the resentment of the Euro
pean powers; it threatens the very foiinda
tion of aristocracy ; it is their greatest dread ;
their power is built upon aristocracy, and de
rives its greatest force therefrotn ; and what
ever has a tendency in afty measure to leflen
that fort of power, mult materially be an ob
e6l of their hatred. At the fame time man
kind arc of such a restless disposition, they
cannot use moderation, the unbounded vio
lence of the people is such that .while we
View the oppreflion of the great with indig

Last night between the hours of 8 and
9 o'cjock a fire broke out in the llore oc
cupied by Mr..Benjamin Lewis, in Market

icated to the adjoining houfesofMr. My

enderffer, which with the geateft part of
their valuable contents were totally cofum
edâthe rapidity and violence with which
the flames spread, had at firft a very threat
eningappearance, but by the spirited exer

The damage fuftaincd is very confkJerable
at the lowed computation, is upwards of
10,000 pounds. " '

From the Knoxville Gazette, Feb. 27.
On, Wednesday the 4th inft. James
Ruflell, Robert Shannon, and William
Cox, on their way from Nafhvilc to this
place, were ambuscaded on the Cumber
land mountain, 18 miles from South Weft
Point, by a party of Indians, confuting
of about twenty five, who fired on them,
and wounded Ruflell through the arm.â
RufTell and Shannon were coming from
Gen. Robertfon to Governor Blount with
public ditpatches. That these men were
not killed. mny be counted among mira
cles. The fails refpe&ing this transac
tion are as follow :
âwas
As these men pafled Obid's river, the
preceding day, they discovered a fire,
which induced them to pu/h forward a
bout fourteen miles, when they turned
off the road, and laid all night without
fire, judging they would be followed by
Indians.
TJÂ»e next morning they kept the woods
four miles before they (truck the road,
and finding 110 ftgn of Indians, they piii 1 -
sued their rout in confidence that they
had not been discovered ; but they had
not proceeded above half a mile,' when
they found therrifelves in a well chosen
spot for an ambuscade, surrounded by. In
dians, the mofl distant of whom was. with*
in thirty feetâthey all fired, "'and many
of them threw their tomahawks, without
doing any injury, except to
ball which struck him was turned in its
direflion-by. a large nietal button, or it
would have pafled through the moil vital
part of his body. Mr. Ruflell is now at
the block house at South Weft Point, un
der the care of a fyrgeon, and it is hoped
the wound will not prove mortal.
On the night of the-tpth inft. William
Robertfon was shot as he was fitting in
his house in Holfton, about 30 miles a
bove this place. Robertfon had fume
months past given information against a
set of counterfeiters and thieves in North
Carolina ; arid it is believed that some one
of this gang has added the murder of Ro
bertfon to their other attrocious crimes.

Extract of a letter from his Excellency
Major-General Anthony Wayne, to
his Excellency Majoi-Generaf Charles
Seott! dated Head-Quarters, Greene
vitte, Feb. roth,* 1794.
" The hostile Indians sent in a flag
some time 6 nee, proposing a ceflation of
arms, and requesting me to appoint the
time and place for holding a general trea
tyâ
" 1 agreed to a ceflation for 30 days,
and then to appoint the time and place
for holding a general treaty, on condi
tion, that they would surrender up all
and every of the American prisoners in
their poifeflion, to the officer command
ing at Fort Recovery, on or before the
I Ith instant.
" Whether the enemy were influenced
by a ferioua wish for peaceâOr whether
this dverture was an' infidyous manoeuvre,
to gain time to procure their provision,
and to remove their women and children
to a place of more security, time will soon
determine.
" For my own part, I think it rather
problematical, from certain circumstances.
attending this extraordinary embafly.
" I have the honor to be with fineere
esteem and rega d,
" Your most obedient
" Humble servant,
" ANTHONY WAYNE.
" The Honorable
" Maj. Gen. Charlej Scott."The pretftte&ion for foreign eonrr&ions,
lo finkin 9 iy apparent in the politics of some
persons, is perfe&ly in unison with the opi
nion, that the United States owe their inde
pendence to the interpolation of an European
power.
It is however to be presumed that this fen
titnem was not in existence when the Britilh
irmv piled their muikcts on the plains of Sa
ratoga.
It 5$ worthy of remark, and a cilrious one
it is, that fomc persons are against any mode
ration of langnage or conduit in. order to
preserve peace, and equally averse from any
tncrcafe of our efficient strength for War.â
If a jwciftc fentimcnt is urged, they cry Bri
tilh a^trit: If the fame pen'on fays, prepare
a folic i'orce, a fclid revenue, they exclaim,
ariftccrat, enemytyf liberty. It is children's
pay to vent our refentmems without reilraint
and without forecaft.
To give cffeA to our. demand for repara
tion of the wrongs done to our trade, we
lLould manifeft a desire for peace, eft'e&ual
preparation for war, a language of com
plaint temperately firm, and an impartial
treatment of all nations. Whoever has done
us .wrong should be to do us right.

From the Diary.
Reply of his Excellency Lord Dorchester
to the Indians of the Seven Villages of
Lower Canada,' as Deputies from all
the Nations who were at the General
Council, held at the Miami, in the
year 1793 ; except the ChawaUous,
Miamis and Loups.
Children,
I HAVE well considered your words,
and am now prepared to reply.
Yon ha* informed me that you are
deputed by the Beven Villages of Lower
Canada, and by all the Nations of the
Upper Country which sent Deputies to
the GeneraiÂ£ouncil held at the Miamis,
except the Chawauous, Miaous, and .
Loups.
Children,
Yoh remind me of what pafied at the
Council Fire held at Quebec just before
my last departure for England, when I
promised to represent their and
wishes to the King their Father and ex*
pre fled xny hope that all the grievances
they complained of, on the part of the
United States, would soon be done away,
by a just and Jailing peace.
. Children,
I remember all very well; I remember
that they pointed out to me the line of re
paration which they wished for between
them and the United States, and with
which they would be fatisfied and make
peace. â¢/ ,
Children,
I was in expectation of hearing from
the People of the United States what was
required by them: I hoped I (honld have
been able to bring you together, and make
you friends. .
Children,
1 have waited long, and liltened with
great attention ; but I have not heard one'
word from them.
Children,
I flattered myfelf with the hope that
the line, proposed. in the year Eighty-
Three, to separate us, from the United
States, which â¢ was .immediately broken
by themselves as soon as the peace was
signed, would have been minded,, or a
new one drawn in an amicable mannerâ
here also I have been disappointed.
Children, .
Since my return, I find no appearance
of a line remains; and from the manner
in which the people..of the United States
push on, and ast and talk on this fide, and
from what I learn of theirconduft towards
the sea, I (hall not be surprised if we are at
war with them in the course of the pre
sent year ; and if we are, ,a line mult then
be drawn by the warriors.
Children,
You aik for a pafTport to go to New-
York ; a paflport is useless in peace; it
appears therefore that you expedt we lhall
be at war with the States before you re
turnâyou (hall hay; a palfport, that whe
ther peace or war you (hall be well receiv
ed by the King's warriors.
Children,
They have destroyed their right of pre
emption; therefore all their approaches
towards us since that time, and all the
purchases made by them, I consider as an
infringement on the King's rights, and
when a line is drawn between us, be it
peace, or war, they mud lose all their im
provements and houses on our fide of it;
the people mull all be gone, who do not
obtain leave to become the King's fub
jeÂ£ts ; what belongs to the Indians will
of course be confirmed and secured to
them. -
Children,
What further can I fat so yo<iâYou
are our witneflfes that on our part we have
acted ip the mod peaceable manner, and
bome the language of âtl)p United States
with patience ; and I our patience
is almo|t exhausted.

Mr. Isaac Clafon.
SIR,
I HAVE to inform you of my lituation.
After a paflage of fifteen days from New-
York, I was captured by four Spanilh priva
teers, three or four leagues to the north-weft
of Cape-Francois j they took out three of my
men, and put on board seven armed men,
and took charge of my brig. The next day
I was boarded by an Engliih frigate from the
Mole.l demanded of the officer that came on
board to know the reason why I was sent in
to port, as my papers were so clear, and I
had nothing on board but American proper
ty. His reply was, that he did not know the
reason : that it remained with. the Captain
on board ; but that the Spaniih and Engliih
fend all American velTels into port; the rea
son why we know not at present. There are
eleven fail of us under the fame predicament.
Some fay they have taken'their cargoes with
out coming to a trial. This is our fituatisn
at present, and what will be done next God
only knows; but from the feiz ; ng of cargoes,
and long detention of veflels, we may think
that H-U has broke loose on American pro
perty; which is very mortifying to your
moil obedient

AN ESSAY ON THE
Natural Equality of Men,
On the Rights that result from it, and on the
Duties which it imposes.
To which a MEDAL was adjudged, by the
Teylerian Society at Haarlem.
Corrected and Enlarged.
By WILLIAM LAWRENCE BROWN,
D. D.
ProfelTor of Moral Philosophy, and the Law
of Nature, and of Ecclesiastical History ;
and Minister of the Englilh Church at U
trecht.
Aliquid temper ad communem utilitatem af
ferent! nm. Cicero.
The Firjl American Edition.
THE grand principle of Equality, if right
ly nnderftood, is the only basis on which
universal justice, sacred order, and perfedfc
freedom, can be firmly built, and permanent
ly secured. The view of it exhibited in this
efTay, at the fame time that it reprefles the
insolence of office, the tyranny of pride, and
the outrages of oppreflion ; confirms, in the
most forcible manner, the necessity of subor
dination, and the just demands of lawful au
thority. So far indeed, from loosening the
bands of society, that it maintains inviolate,
every natural and every civil diftinftion,
draws more closely every social tie, unites in
one harmonious and justly proportioned sys
tem, and brings men together on the even
ground of the inherent rights of human na
ture, of reciprocal obligation, and of a com
mon relation to the community.
