[continued.]
Another charge again ft the Secretary
â¬>f State is, that his report calls the difcri
rtiinatirrg duties in Great Britain hi favor
of American woody small, whereas they
are considerable* and in fbveral in fiances,
high.
Mr. M. said he had not found Jeifure to
trace this branch of our exports into alt
the details neeeflarv to decide in what de
gree the duties were small or confidcrable,
and in what proportion the several dutied
articles went to Great Britain. He ob
served in general that the greater part of
our woods were exported to the Weft-In
dics, not to Great Britain. That in the
(hip-woods, at least the Baltic nations wertf
not iivali to the United States. It wa*
known thai Sweden and Denmark were
so deficient in oak, that their public navies
were supplied from Germany, and that
the (hip timbers of Ruflia were tjanfporu
ed a thousand or twelve hundred miles from
her interior dominions. The fir, of which
the Swedi(h and Dani(h merchant ship*
were built, does not lad more than feverc
or eight years, and could not therefore
be a rival to the durable wood* of the
nited States*
He observed also ffiat timber, and par
ticularly the (hip woods of this country,
were so precious and so sure of being iiv
demand, that they never could fear a ri
val, or need a foreign bounty. This was
an article very different from such as were
an annual product of the earth: and as
could be raised wherever the climate and
foil permited, according to the occasional
demand. The forefts that were to sup
ply the /hip-yards were the growth of
centuries, and where once destroyed, as
they generally are in Europe, are rarely
replaced at asl r and never can become the
rival to America, which enjoys them aÂ»
the spontaneous gift of nature.
To enhance the merit of the Briu'fh
regulation, the gentleman had told us,
that wood was fubjeft to a duty of i per
cent, in the French I (lands, and in the
Britilh free, with a prohibition of other
foreign wood. This was of little conse
quence. The duty was a trifle, and fal
ling on a ncccfTary article to be got no
where else, probably was paid by the
French I(landers. And the prohibition l
was ideal, the American wood being the
only resource for the Britifti market.
The article of Fish, was admitted by
the gentleman himfelf, to be more favor
ed' by the French than the British fyflem,
though he admits it with relu&ance and
diminishes the difference as much as pos
sible. The cafe however is so clear, and
the facts so palpable, that they speak for'
ihemfelves. Under the French regulati
ons, this important article of our com
merce, is fubjeft to duties only r in Europe
and the Weft-Indies. Under the British,
it is under prohibition in both. The a
mount of the whole exports is 383,237
quintals of dry, and 57,424 bands of
picklcd fifTi. Of this the French eonfump
tion, is 2 2,1" 1 quintals and 45* 164 bar
rels ; that is, nearly Â§ of the dry, and 4-e
of the pickled fifh.
Here Mr. M. proceeding to the fubjeft
of whale oil, called the attention of the
committee particularly to the representa
tion and language of Mr. Smith as to the
the conduit of France, in inviting the fifh
ermen of Nantucket to remove and fet
tle at Dunkirk. Mr. Smith, he fold, had
not only undervalued the monopoly of
the French market granted to-the United
States, but had, by a mutilated quotation
of a report of the secretary of State on the
fi(heries, changed the true afpeft of the at
tempt to draw away the- Nantucket fifli
ermen. The faS was, that although- tfcerundti& of France was very different from
what was to have been wished, as well as
f:um v '.at was contemplated by the mar
qua, la Fayette, *ho had patronized tiie
iuteieii oi tl.de hlbennrn, yet that the
prujeft of tempting tht ro to emigrate had
origina ed in Gtvat-I'.ritain, and was a
counUr-prujcC on the part of France. How
ttw happened to omit the an
tecedent attempt of Great-Britain, and
thereby exaggerate that of France, Mr.
M. did not undertake to explain : but it
wjs the more extiaoidir.ary, at. the whole
acixmnt of the tranfaclion was contained
in the fame page of the report, nay in the
fame paragraph, from which the gentle
man hrfd extracted "his information.
Hero lie read thepaflage m that report,
am! produced the British llatute, inviting
the whale lithe.man, by an offer of tcr
ta a privileges to emigrate to Great Bri-
A further charge again (I the Secretaiy
of St*te is, that in his flattmeut of the
tonnage of the United States employed
in tn. A trade with the French and Bntilh
dominions, he founded it,net on the aSual
number of Jbift, but on the number of en
tries. This charge was as lingular as it
was uncandid.
The re-port Hated the fad, that the A
mencan ton nage mitring our ports from
the several nations with which the United
loded, was so and so; and in this
ilaumcat, it pursued the official returns
made or. the fubjeft. What more was to
be required ?
In giving the tact, the secretary irr.pof
ed Â«.;i no one, because he Hated the ton
ua 0 to be entry tonnage, as it really

from the entry tonnage, had

form, was called for tince the refolutious
on the table were proposed.
TKeleconfideratichsmigh? have re ft rain
ed the gentleman from this unwarrant
ed attack on the accuracy of ths report.
Bui he ought at leatf to have been lure,
th \ whftft h * was charging the Secretary
\*;':i following an erroneous guide, he
\ t him ft If following one that was noter
-1 ' ous. The examination of this point
i" Ived facts which iperited the particu-
.1 atie.ition of the committse,

the V M.'ted States in foreign trade for I 792
lately called for and reported, 15415,331
t. -'W.
for the fame year is 289,394 toHs.
On comparing t'nefe two quantities, it
was evident that both could not be right.
If the entry tonnage was no more than
was (lated, it was inconceivable that the
afiual tonnage could be as much as was
ftp.ud. It would allow the veflels in the
Kuropean and Weft India trades together
but (omcwhat more than one voyage and
a third a year. It could never lÂ»e suppos
ed, thai this corresponded with the fa&.
liow then was the inconsistency in the
two ftatemcnts to be explained ?
Mr. M. said, as he did not know by
what rule the achial tonnage was made
up, he would form no cor.jedhire on the
fhl ject. He hoped,and wished that some
gcn'leman more conversant with it, Would
{llvc the phenonenoon. He did not call
011 the gentleman from South Carolina,be
cause he moll of all, must he puzzled to
account for it ; having stated that onr ves
sels in the trade to Europe make two voy
ages, and in the Weft India trade four
voyages a year.
Betides the evidence contained in this
companion of the aggregate tonnage in
the two different forms, in which it had
heen reported,the exiitence of error some
where, and probably in the acconnt of
the a&ual tonnage resulted from a compa
rative view of our exports to the British
dominions, for the two years of 1790
and 1792, and of the whole tonnage A
rr - itHn and British employed in convey
%
ing titCÃi*
In the former year the exports were
f,363,416 dollars. Intlirlatter 8,269,495
dollars; the txceft for 1790, 1,093,921
iuflars.
Tlie entry tonnage, British and Ame
rican for 1790, was 272,580 tons.
The British miry tonnage for 1792.
was 206, $84 tons. The aÃual American
to->n"V T < for 1792, was according to t<ie
official llateir.cnt, 66,581 tons; which
turned into entry tonnage, according to
the proportion of the whole actual, to
the whole enti-y tonnage for that year,
mikes the American entry tonnage, in
the trade to Great Britain about 95,000
tons.
Adding this to the Britilh entry ton
nagt of 296,384 tor:3 > the Britilh and
American together for 1792, amounts to
301,384 tons ; which exceeds the ton
nage of 1790 no lcfs thai> 27,804 tons.
According to this calculation, which
embraces the actual tonnr.gc as ltated to
die house, there would be 27,804 tons
more,employed in tranfpoiting 1,193,921
dollars Ids; making our tonnage to in
crease in that proportion as the employ
ment of itdecrcafed.
There was a pollibflity, Mr. M. ob
fened, that the course of trade in the
two years, might be such that more of
the vessels employed in the expertations
to Great Britain might be entered in 1790
as coming from some other country, than
in 1792 i but as there was no knov.n cir
cumftar.ee which authorized this folutior,
and as it seemed denionltiable in general,
that error existed somewhere in the flate
ments, and molt probably in thofc of the
actual tonnage, he concluded that it ought
to be referred to that source ; and confe
qnently, that the guide followed by the
Secretary- of State, to wit, the entry
tonnage, the only one he had to follow,
was not more inaccurate, than the a<stual
tonnage would have been, which guided
the member from South Carolina.
Another position of the Secretary of
State on which a charge is founded, is,
" that the greater part of what Great
Britain receives from the United States is
re-exported." This, polition, Mr. M.
reminded the committee, related to Great
Britain without comprehending the Weft
India iflanda, which formed a diltinCt
branch in the Secretary 3 ! report. How
far it was liable to the exceptions taken
againlt it, would appear from an exami
tion of facts.
To obviate critieifms, Mr. M. said he
would take for The baiis of his calcula
tions, the ilatement given in detail by the
gentleman himfelf, of the exports for
1790, to the -French and British domi
nions ; which though not' extended to
every item, approached so near to a fuOl
view of the tiade, as to be adequate to
the purpose.
In this ftatcment the exports to Great
Britain (land at dollars j from
which must be iubtra&eu, for the compa
rison, the amount of the fcveral re-exper
tations as far as they can be liquidated.
Tobacco. It appears from an official
document, that the tobacco exported to
Gteat Britain in 1791, was 67,216 hogs
heads. A return for another year Hates
the quantity to be 52,505 hogsheads. It
appeared from the revenue returns of
Great Britain, that the consumption of
this article amounted to 9,600 hogsheads.
The proportion re-exported might then
be reafpnably set down at four-fifths of the
quantity imj>orted.
Rice. To obtain the proportion of
rice re-exported, we may take the medi
um quantity imported for three years,
immediately preceding the revolution,
which, accordingly to a table in Ander
fon's Hiflory of Commerce, was 486,543
cwt. By another table for the fame pe
riod, the medium quantity exported was
349,653 cwt. Tbe difference marks the
confamption, and is 136,890 cwt. The
quantity exported to Great Britain from
the United States in 1792, was 58,978
barrels, equal to 294,890 cwt. Compar
ing the quantity consumed with this quan
tity, it appears that more than half, tho'
less than two thirds, is re-exportedâcall
the re-exportation one half only qf the
present importation.
Indigo. According to a statement in
Anderi'on, the medium importations into
Greal-Britain, for three years immedi
diately preceding the revolution, were a
bout thrice the medium quantity re-ex
portei'. Call the proportion re-exported
now, however, one-fifth only, which it
probably below the faA.
From these proportions, and the data
furnilhed by the gentleman's own state
ments, results the following juftification
of the report of the Secretary on this
point.
Dollars.
Exports to Great Britain 6,651,429

Here, then, it appears, that the re-ex
portations of the four articles alone, of
Tobacco, Rice, Indigo and Wheat, are
greater than the wlu>le confuroption in
Great Britain, of the articles imported
from the United States, although the
most unfavorable year has been taken, for
the enquiry ; and, consequently, that the
position of the Secretary of State, was
well founded.
( Speech to ie continued.)
Mr. Fenno,
You are requested to give the inclosed
remarks made by Mr. Giles, a place in
your paper as soon as may consist with the
arrangements of your prefjâit is the ra
ther requested, beeaufe the manner in
which you have dated the tranlaflion, to
which they relate, was not calculated to
convey the truth of the cafe. *
From the General Arlvert'tfer.
Substance of the remarks made by Mr.
Giles, in the House of Representatives,
on the 24th of February, 1794 ; âupon
a motion for entering into the coniidera
tion of the resolutions proposed in the
early part of the fefiion ; requiring an ex
amination into the (late of the Treasury
Department, by committee.
Mr. Giles observed that very shortly af
ter the meeting of Cengrefs, he had laid
this resolution on the table, under a con
viction of the propriety of the meaftire,
and the hope of a speedy decision upon it.
An occurrence took plate a few days af
terwards, which produced a temporary
delay. An individual pre&nted a memori
al to Congress, containing some suggesti
ons again (I the official conduct of the gen
tleman at the head of the Department;
and to have pressed the enquiry into the
general state of the Treasury, during the
pendency ofthofe suggestions, might have
been deemed a violation of delicacy and
propriety: Very soon after the imputa
tions from that source, were done away,
by report of a committee ; lie" had called
up the resolution ; but the House acting
under the impreflions produced by the de
licate crisis of our external affairs, refufed
to enter into the coufideration of the fub
jeft at that time.
Mr. Giles remarked, that whilfl on the
one hand, he was desirous of looking into
a fubjeft which he deemed important to
the public welfare, as well as to gratify
an officer in a requcfl, which he conceiv
ed, had been impelled by the delicacy of
his situation ; he was not unwilling on the
other hand, to yield to the opinion of the
House, which induced an immediate at
tention to our affairs with foreign nations.
The fubjefts of commercial regulations,
and the naval armament, being now out
of the view of the House, at leall for some
days, he hoped the chasm would be filled
by the consideration of the resolution he
had proposed. He could not help re
marking, that at an early period of the
feflion, this resolution had been termed
the torch of discord. He thought if it

knowledge of the state of iKe Treasury

obvious duty of the House of Representa
tives, operating equally upon every indivi

seemed strange to him, that an attempt to

view of the public finances, and the modes

or from the principle that they ought not
to poflefs it ; but that the whole know
ledge of this fubjeft (hould be left to thÂ«
Treasury officers. If this doiSrine be con
tended for, he thought it ought to (Simu
late the exertions of those, who believed
it to be fubterfive of the primary principle

He icquclied the House to accompany
him in making a few reflections upon this
fubjeft.
3,-01,067
The debt of the United States, forms
an important item of legislation : Its fyf-
U-m is intricate; its extent unknown ; it
embraces the interefls of a very sagacious
and powerful class of citizens: It is made
by the constitution, the peculiar province
of the Representatives, immediately cho
sen by the people, to superintend the con
tributions, and the attributions of all
public monies. This may be deemed the
highest duty of the Representatives. It
may be allied, how this mo!l important
of duties, can be underltandinglyperform
ed, but by a knowledge of the whole ma
chinery of the Treasury Department ?
There can be no prospect of ading -jjifely,
where there are no means of judging rightly.
The omiflion to discharge this important
legislative fun&ion, by the Representatives,
will neccflarily cause it to be performed
by the Head of the Department. A spe
cies of laws will grow out of an inatten
tion to, and a consequent ignorance of this
fubjeA, which may be called, the rules of
office ; theforms of the Treasury ; the prac
tical conJlruSiors 'f laws,contravening the
legal conftruÂ£lions. Iu all conflicts between
this species of laws, and the laws pro
nounced by the constitutional tribunal,
the advantage would he in favor of the
Treasury system : Because this would be
the practical, that the theoretic system of
legislation. An inattention to this fub
jeft, which is an intricate and complicat
ed one, and a confequertt ignorance of it,,
might in a course of time, leave to the Le
gislature, the mere right of regifttrinjj
'I'reafury edidb. It may be said, that this
is not the cafe at prefetit: It is not pro
posed to giye any opinion on this point;
the remarks have been intended to (hew
the probable tendency of intruding this
important branch of legislation, to the
Treasury Department; which would be
the infallible confequeiice of the ignorance
of the Legislature, of the Treasury pro
ceedings.
The propriety of placing confidence, in
the Executive Officers, is an argument
very familiar to this House. To a certain
extent, it is in every refpeft proper. It
is proper, so long as the officer confines
himfelf to his legal aefignated functions :
If in any cafe, he (hould exceed these, it
becomes the duty of the Lcgiflature, to
notice the proceeding. It is also the duty
of the Legillrtuir to afcertoin his functions
by law, and to limit his discretion. *9his
argument of confidence in the executive
officers, may easily be carried to a danger
ous exctfs. The people have confidence
in their Representatives ; they bellow on
them certain trusts, and impose on them
certain duties. The reprelentatitves have
confidence in the executive officers. They
transfer to them, these trusts and thele
duties. What would be the result ? A
complete and radical change in the mod
essential chara&er of the government:.
In Ilea J of the Legislature prcfcribing
rules of conduit to the people, the execu
tive officers would prescribe them ; and
the Legislature would be of no other use
than to legjdife executive proceedings.
This would be a desertion of the trust re
posed in the "representative. The consi
deration of individaal ease, would always
operate in fivor of this idea. The argu
ment of individual interell might poflibly
aid it in some inllances, and the argument
of policy in others ; for there may be some
individuals, who might poflibly prefer that,
to the constitutional (late of things. These
remarks had been made to flievr, in verygeneral terms the impressions which the
fubjed had made on his mind ; to exhibit
its general object; to prove that it was not
unimportant: And that if fcich should be
the opinion of the House, the stage of the
fcfiion require 3 that it Ihould receive im
mediate attention.
PHILADELPHIA,
MARCH 5.
THEATRICALS.
OBSERVER, No. VI.
Monday evening, at the New Theatre,
the " Schpol for Scandal," âand the
" Poor Soldier" were played.
The Performance was honored with
a numerous and refpeflable company, fi
lming which were the President of tne
United States, his Lady and family, and
the Vice President.
The President was welcomed with 3
cheers, and the miific gave us the Prefi
dent's March; so far, well; but in the
course of the evening, the people in tiie
gallery were extremely noisy and inde
cent.
To the managers a hint; â The persons
in the Gallery interrupt those who vvilh to
hear, they hiss the heft pieces of mafic ;
a per lon in one of the fide-Boxes, observ
ed iome lads of Spirit spit upon people in
the Pit. Gentlemen, a reform mud be
effe&ed, oryourhonfe will be solitary.â
Those who wife for rational and decent a
musement, will contribute to indemnify
you, and (hut the Gallery entirely, if you
cannot reilrain the unruly people who fre
quent it. Your interest is deeply concern
ed in attending to this hint.
A hint to the a&ors.âSet afiae Mr.
Bates and Mrs. Morris, and the " School
for Scandal" was not performed well ;
the Old Company have done it much bet
ter ; choose a better play, or perform this
better, if you mean not to ftupify the au
dience : ITie play itfelt will never rife a
bove mediocrity, and unless helped out by
uncommon merit in action, had better be
consigned to oblivion.
Mr. WignelPs forte, is the part of Dar
ky in " Tbe Poor Soldier," and Mr. Dar
ley and Mfs. Brnadlmrfi, in the songs of
the " Twins of I.atona" and the " Mea
dows loot Cheerful" were equal, if not
fuperiot- to themselves, on any former ex-
hibition.
But however much the Observer wifties
to praise, the players will consider, that
undeserved applaule,is the highest exercise
of cen'fure ; and that disagreeable truths
are often profitable.
The whole performance on Monday
evening was but tolerable, when conlider
ed / collectively ; when analysed, many
parts wanted animation, were awkward,
and in Ihort, if not intolerable, approach
ed very hear to it. If this hint is improv
cd to advantage, particulars will be pur
pofclv avoided.
Genuine extraÂ£l of a letter from a Mer
chant of the fiift intelligence and re
fpeftability in an Eastern State, to his
Correspondent in this City.
" I am happy to find it your opinion
that Mr. Madison's plan would have been
reje&ed, had it been put to the vote. 1
think the question being deferred until
March will not render it more likely to
succeedâtheir party mud and will lefTen.
AU the merchants in this and the neigh
boring towns, are decided againil the lyf
tem at this time; and consider it,if adopt
ed, calculated to involve us in ruin, by the
total deftru&ion of our fiourifhing com
merce. Our navigation is well employedâ
ofcourfe our marincrs& mechanics. Their
wages were never so high in peace, and
the produce of our country finds a ready
market.
Mr. Smith of South Carolina, has clear
ly proved the advantage of our commerce
with Great-Britain. Indeed it must be
obvious to every oneâhis speech has been
much approved here.
I presume that Congress will be influ
enced by motives that will conduce moll
to the general good, and not by that pie
judice and party spirit which Mr. Madi
son's* plan appears to have been founded
upon. No advantage can derive from any
pl-.Ds formed on tlnjfe principles.
It gives us pleafare to find the northern
members and (o many from the commer
cial towns to the southward, united a
gaiaft the reftri&ing system. I wish they
may continue united and firm in opposing
this and every other mealnre calculated
to destroy the good government, and im
poverish and dilturb the happy people of
the United States. Ido hope and be
lieve thev will gain strength and support
in every measure, tending to support go
vernment, and to keep us from the great
calamity of war, and European politics.
Many of our merchants have fullered
greatly by the detention of our vefiels in
France. They will not continue to fend
their property to that country from
whence there is no return, except mad
politics. Such conduct as the French
are pra&ifing will loon wean us from pre
judices in their favor.
Many among us complain that Congress
have not duly attended to checking the
Algerines. We think that object merits
their firft attention. I am.glad to find the
vote for building fix ihips has been ob
tained, they are thought to be adequate
to keeping the pirates within the Streights.
Wilhing that pe?ce may be obtained
with them, and prcferved with all other
nations. I am &c.

A LAW SCRAP.
Part for ike vfe of M. Careyâthe fefl. for
whom it may cotu'ern,
A YOUNG man who was confined
in gaol, in October last, amongst a number
of other prisoners, for a debt of Â£. J 13 9.
at the suit of a Quaker trader of consider
able property in the county, was taken
dangerously lick with the Yellow Fever,
which he had catched in Philadelphia :â
At the earned and repeated solicitations
of all the prisoners and inhabitants of the
village, he was removed ont of prison to
hi? mother's house, where he died of the
fever about two days after.âThe plantifF
a few weeks ago brought an action against
the Sheriff of the county for the escape
of this dead man, before a Justice of the
Peace, and obtained a judgment against
him; from whieh the. Sheriff appealed to
the feflions.âWhen the cause came 011
(General Whiffet* havingprevioufly iflued
fer.ret orders to his subalterns for'conduc
ing the battle) Corporal Catfjh supported
by Serjeant Snipe, opened for the appellee,
by moving the Court " to order the Pre
lidertt of the Court togo off the bench."â
After about 3 hours grinning and chin
wagging, the President addressed them to
the following purport: " Gentlemen, you â¢
r, ay save yourselves any further trouble on
this fubjeft. 1 know my duty and mean
to do it. I will not desert my post let who
will order it.âForce may remove me, but
the Law will not. I am no boxer or
military man, but your attack formidable
as it may appear to yo-.t, does not terrify
me. As for General Whiffet and Corporal
Catfjh, I have been a witness of their re
doubtable prowess, in the Yellow Fever
campaign of last fall. I know the force of
Camphorated bullets while I was a prafti
cioner, and I have not yet forgot the smell
of them. Pleafc to change your plan of
operation and go on with the appeal,
which the Court ordered on accordingly.
N. B. The particulars of this cafe will
be published after the decision.
* This fame General was the mojl aflivr
man in the To wn, in urging the removal of
this Sick Man, and was so frightened with
the name of the Yellow Fever, that Camphor
itfelf eould hardly leep life in hiifiâThe
very smell of gun-powder inflantly gives
him the Cannon Fever.
Tie following mifcdlannus articles are co
pied from the American Star.
A letter was read to the Convention
from the Commidioners at I-a Vendee,
conceived in these terms, " La Vendee
is 110 moreâall the country that it con
tained i 9 actually occupied fay the troops
of the Conventionâa profound silence
reigns over this landâthe country may
be travelled without almost meeting a An
gle manâexcept Cliolet de St. Florent,
and some little villages, we have not left
behind us pnv thing but allies and dead
bodies."
The Commidioners of Lyons wrote
(the 22d) to the Convention, that since
their entiy they have every day been en-
gaged in decapitating criminals, and that
they are disposed to put in execution the
decree for the detlru&ion of that rebel-
lious city
The Revolutionary tribunal haÂ« divided
itfelf into two fedtious for the purpose of
accelerating its labors.
The Convention decreed on the 6th of
December, that the itatue of Rousseau be
erected in one of the squares of Paris.
A report was made to the Convention,
whose tendency was tofubilitute an univer
sal worship of Reason infteadof Chriftian
ifm. The report finifhes thus; " Con
tinue to diredfc in a firm and rapid man
ner, the great movement imprefTed by the
French people on the human heart, and
compleat the gospel of equality, which is
to triumph over the most ancient preju
dices and renew the face of the world."
The day after this report, Gobet, the
conditutional bishop of Paris, with his
vicars, accompanied by the conllituted au
thorities, and wearing the cap of liberty,
declared at the bar of the Convention,
that they renounced their fun&ions as
bishop and prieits.
Coupe, an ancient curate, Lindent, bi
shop of the department of Eure, Miller,
curate in that of the lower Seine, Julien
de Tooioufe, miniiter of the protestant re
ligion, Cevernon, curate of La Vendee,
and many others appeared at the tribunal,
and there made the fame declaration.
