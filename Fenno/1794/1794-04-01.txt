Copy of 3 letter from a gentleman now
in Prance to hfs friend in this town,
received by the brig Dolphin, just ar
flAed at Providence, dated
Havre, Dec. 30, 1793.
1 wrote you by tht fame opportunity a
fe\y days firice; I then told you of the
fticpeft of the armies of the Republic in
the taking of Taubm and Valenckunet;
this day, being the Demidi, we have been
celebrating the event, or rather rejoicing
with our brethren of this Republic, at
the re-capture of T0,,10n. Thjs morning
arrived here the CQttjirmqUoÃ of the taking
of Vqleneitinnes ; it is fjtid that the Aujiri,
am loft r4(Ooo killed, and that 6000
caine over and joined the armies of the
Republic, the reft were taken prisoners.
? b? v Â« also had accounts that the re-
Ijelp at La Vendee, are completely cut
yp. On every fide success attends the
French arms.
It fcarccly now admita of a doubt but
that die TREE of LIBERTY, planted
in this country, will take root, and spread
ftsfcranchej over Europe, and that tyran
ny and qpprejjipn will be no more. If
tte f>rayÂ«v 6( an individual will avail any
towards it, I wiH pray without ceasing.

ffeufe ef Reprcjentatives
Subtlanfe of the remarks made by Mr. Giles
on the ioth of March r-04, upoij the
qtieftioi} tor thp paflage of the bill provi
ding a naval armament.
Another objection to the measure, con
sists of the certainty and enormity of .the
expeuce, with a total uncertainty of its
efficacy; whereas the plan of ptirchaiing
a peace, regard* oeconomy, if its efficacy
should he doubtful : in this cafe, if the
objed be not e fatted, the money will
h<pt be expended. It is but a bad characi
ter of a measure, to fay it is neither cer
tain in its object, nor (Economical in its
arrangement; yet these ait the mod ftri
â¢king traits iti the present bill. When
this measure was flrtt brought into view,
if was thought neceflary that an estimate
I it,this eftimate,he knew
1 11 qt for what reafon,was kept out of view.
' It was nevertheless an estimate, and mult
; again make its appearance in the npufe.
He expected too, that it wonld apppear
ii) a mons formidable shape ;han when it
was iirft introduced. The pay of the
feamefl, the most important item in the
| estimate, had varied its (hape materially :
It is novy calculated at double the estimate
; fir ft -made, and he apprehended that the
fame fate would attend other parts of the
estimate. He admited that the sum men
tioned in the bill, did not positively ffx
the wages of the seamen, but was in
tended as a limit to the Pt-efident's
discretion: He was inclined to think
however, from the nature of the
that the whole sum would be found jie.
peflary ; for all the otherperquifites, whieh
the seamen will expedt, mult consist of toil
and danger.
tje oblerved, that the intelligence late
ly received, in his opinion, served to con
firm all those objections, although he sup
posed it had affected the minds of other
gentlemen very differently ; because he
had observed more votes in favor of the
bill, Unce the receipt of the
than before that period. The intelligence
being communicated in confidence, he fup
poM it would be improper to particular
ise those parts of it, which affected his opi
nion : He Ihould therefore, only remaik
in genera), that the intelligence had led
bis to two copclufions.
lit. That .the forcc to 1 fed, i*
abfolytely inadequate to tl . 3 .
That by proper . iue-
R.ientlon to time and opportunity, a prace
tniy be effected by money. In cither cafe,
the natal armament would be rendered
unncceflitry, and the expeuce .-.ought nut
to be incurred. : .
Mr. Giles proceeded to tottGder the bill
as die foundation of a permanent naval es
tablishment.
He &id there was a clause in the bill au
thoring the President to suspend all pro
ceedings in the equipment of the armament
in cafe of a peace with Algiers, which- gave
himjome consolation ; but it did not altoge
ther relieve his apprehensions from this ope
ration t>f the measure, because he knew that
a permanent naval eftahlilhment was a favor
ite policy with some gentlemen, and because
the argument had been urged in favor of the
present bill. v
He observed that a permanent naval eila
blifhment coidd be recommended to the
United States, but from one or both of the
following considerations. Either upon the
principle of entering into a competition for
naval power with the powers of Europe; or
as affording security to the collection of our
own revenue.
He thought the question of a permanent
naval establishment, was one of the raoft im
portant, which could be presented to the
consideration of the house, and that the most
serious consequences were neceilarily con
nected with it. In the firft place, he viewed
the eftablilhment of a navy as a complete
I|flercli<Sion of the policy of discharging the
principal of the public debt. Hiftorydoes
not afford an instance of a nation which con
tinued to encreafe their navy, and decreased
their debt at the fame time. It is an operation
exceeding the ability of any nation. The
naval competition of the powers in Europe
has oppression to their fubjecfls, and
rum to themselves. The ruin of French mo
narchy, he believed, might be ascribed very
much to that cause. A navy is tlTe most ex
pensive of all means of defence, and the ty
ranny of governments consists in the expen
fivenefs of their machinery. The expen
fivenefs of the French monarchy is the true
.cause of its defirwftion. The navy of France
furnifhed the principal item of that expence.
The navy produced expence, the expence ex
ceeded the revenue, newcontributionsbecame
necefiary, the people flw the tyranny an,d de
stroyed the. tyrant. The fame efi'eft by the
fame policy, will probatbly be produced in
Great Britain. The government is not yet
deflroyed, but the people are opprefled, li
berty is banished. The exienfmenefs of the
government is the true ground of the oppref-
Jian of the people. T,he king, the nobility,
the priesthood, the army, and above all the
naij.
( Speech to be continued.)
For the Gazette of the United Stages,
Mr. Fen no,
War! War! War! Embargo! Em
bargo ! Embargo ! Are the pass words
now, with some people among us, and in
two or three inftanccs, 1 have seen that a
man who offers a contrary opinion, is in
danger of getting a black eye, and a bloody
noseâbut who are those, you may a Ik,
that thus violate the rights of opinion, which
our blefled conflitution and laws, allow to
every free born Citizen of the United
States ? They are men, (except one) who
do not own a timber head, in any Ship or
J'ejfelâthey are men who have lately made
large purchases of different kinds of goods,
under an idea, that an Embargo, and a
war will soon take placeâand that one,
cr both events mull in their consequences,
give them an opportunity of mating great
profits by their speculations.âThis, Mr.
Fenno, is a matter of failâand is well
known in this City : Let me alk you
then, what mull every honest, industrious
and peaceable Citizen thjnk of men, who
thus with to make fortunes for themselves
at the expence of the ruin of thousands of
poor innocent families. Let me sflc those
gentlemen, what the labouier, the
Mechanic, the Sea-Earing Man, with
their Wives and Children, are to do
for subsistence, in cafe our commerce
should be totally knocked up :âAnd I
believe it is beyond doubt that it will,
Ihould we get involved in a warâin short
a war mull be certain ruin to the country
in generalâbut fay the speculators* let it
be so, provided we makefortunes by it.
Among those gentlemen is one (above
excepted) who has lately sprung up among
us as an Orator :âI mull take particular
notice of him. In one of his orations in
"the State House yard on a late occasion ;
he in a very .indecent manner, called on
the men of 76, who are generally under
stood to be those who had fought and bled
to eftablilh our libertiesâlet me now call
on him, and ailc him where he was at
that period, or what he did in support of
that cause ? Surely it is a faÂ£t well known
â¢ he a lat time pofiefled any fixed
politicks,, it was rather in
fav. tive countryâand k is e
<; ;a - ,c,tl it till tlie present crisis, he
his never fhnvn a contrary dispositionâ
but his inierejl alone y regttlaterJiis conduct;
while he was aiding his father in-the pur
iuit of an an:iuiiy, from the Britidl Nati
on, arid reparation for. lufies in this coun
try, which he never fujiaincd, he held up
that nation ; and their Government to the
world, in the molt exalted point of view :
now his ends are accomplishedâhe coincs
forward with every abuse that language
can bestow upon both nation and Govern
ment ; and such is the man> that I will
venture to afiert, he will be ready to act
the fame part towards this Country,
whenever he (hall iind it conducive to his
private emolumentâa party spirit, added
to some other circumllances, got him' a
feat in our Aflembly ; through the fame
party, he now looks forward to a feat in
the Legi/lature of the United States ; and
yet no man ever expressed a greater con
tempt of another, than he has done of this
party, which he now courts and seems to
adore :âhowever it is perfectly consistent
with the manâhe will descend to any
thing to gratify his avarice, or ambition.

The fallowing letter was read from the Re
presentatives of the people, j. B. Latofte and
Baudot :
" Germerlheim, 9 Nivofe . [29 Dec ]
" The success of the armies of the Mozelle
and the Rhine, dear colleagues, are aftnuilh
1 ! g, and their march is inoft rapid : they ycf
terday made themselves mailers of the im
portant pod of Germerlheim, which covers
Landau, aflures the preservation of the lines
of {Jueich, and opens the door of the Palati
nate. Our brave defenders are, at this, mo
mrnt, within one league of Spires, and we a'e
allured, that the light troops have entered
the Town. We are allured also, that the
Prullians and Auliiiam, in separating, made
'r a<^'eu to each other, 011 coining out of
'he little Town of Bergzabren, with Itmkes
of their sabres. and with a tlilcharre i,{ iheii
fufils.
" The firft'have retired to Neuftadi and
Mayence; the second have rephfltd the Rhine
by three different bridges, which they had tht
wife precaution to rrefV for the purpefc.
It was time ; for if they had not mape
the best use of their legs, for many days
and uights, they would have been "all ex
terminated. Their routs are covered with
prifonets and deserters.
" The courageous perseverance of the
Armies who have delivered Landau, and
of the garrison who preserved it, ought to
procure for them the fame honours as the
Army that besieged Toulon. We believe
that we only participate in your intentions
in expressly desiring it.
" The battle of Kaifberg has proved to
the enemies, that they have nothing but
deftrudlion to look for from the defendersof
the Republic ; after more than four hours
of a charge ; under a terrible and inceflant
fire, not a single soldier (hrunk from the
ratiks, and they fawthe stragglers run
ning in all directions, and at their utmost
speed, to partake in the glory of their in
trepid brothers in arms; thus the victory
was compleat, and afcertaincd the triumph
of the Republic.
" The Enemy have left uÂ» considerable
Magazines at Lautetbourg, and particular
ly of Powder, to which they had put a
match, which they had lighted on their
departure ; it was extinguiihed in the very
ftioment when it was to explode,, and to

gained a complete victory over the French
at Anweller on the 28th, and Wurmfer

he had on the 24th. It is likewise said,
that Landau is still blockaded. There are

these accounts.

January 9.
Last night a meflenger arrived with
dispatches Jrom Ghent and BrufTels. By
letters from the latter place, dated the 6th
instant, we learn that a part of the British
army had moved to Courtray, whither it
was expected the head-quarters of his roy
al highness the duke of York would be
transferred.
Letters from Manheim and Frankfort,
on the 29th and 30th instant, speak pret
ty confidently of a viÂ£tory gained by the
duke of Brunfwick over the French, iti
the Valley of Anweller, on the 28th.â
We are sorry to add, that these accounts
are not confirmed by any official intelli
gence.
We extraÂ£l: the following article from,
a BrufTels paper of the 6th instant, enti
tled, " Journal de la Guerre."
"An officer of the regiment of royal
infantry, belonging to the royal Catholic
army, employed in the army of La Ven
dee, was made a prisoner in the affair of
Mans on the 4th of Dec. He was to
have been (hot on the 6th J but he found
means to escape to Paris on foot, and
from thence to the Frontierâhe is at this
time at Mons.
" He reports that the royalists army js
not to be numbered. They have 15000
regular troops, Auftrians, Swiss, ancient
Marechauffee and soldiers. They have
not lefsthan zoo pieces of cannon.
The affair of Granville was only meant
as an attempt. Tfcy did not mean to
enter upon a regular siege ; for, though
they had 70,000 men before-the town,
they were not calculated for that kind of
attack, mostly peasants, who strong
ly attached to the cause, were ar.xioustÂ©
have a poll to give up to the royalists.
" They anximifly looked for succours
from England, and particularly a rein
forcement of engineers, and officers of ar
tillery and infantry. It was not till the
beginning of december that they knew
hat the English were disposed to succour
them,
" He laid,, that the affair of Mans cost
each party nine or ten thousand men. The
two armies reciprocally fliot their prison
ers. It was jeftimitid, that the campaign
in La Y endee had colt France more than
two hundred thousand men !
" The royaiifts army bad been twice
almost entirely i;enpwed. They drew their
bett recruits from .Britanny. They con
fidei* the- Bretons as' the flower of, their ar
my. ' _ .
" The plan was, after the affair of Mans,
to march to Paris; but circumstances
had finee occurred to alter that destina
tion."

The Flanders mail which arrived this
day, brings the confirmation of the raif.
ing of the blockade of Landau, and the
re-pafling of the Rhine by the Austrian
and Prufiian armies, who, after sb many
victories gained, and the greatest hard-
ihips fufFercd witli the uimofl patience
heroism, were obliged to yield at last to
i thÂ« superior numbers of the Sans-Culottes,
who, ever since the 22d ult. with a force
reckoned at 180, coo men, and a numer
onrs and formidable artillery, made the
molt desperate attacks upon Gen. Wurm
fer and the duke of Brunfwick.
On the 25th the prince Hohenlohe was
(lightly wounded.
011 the 26th the duke of Bjrunfwick
attempted to make an attack, but the
French got the Itart of him, and after
the most bloody conflict, the Pfuffians and
the Auftrians were both obliged to re
treat.
On the 26th, the cordon of General
Wurmfer was also obliged to retreat, af
ter an immense quantity of blood (hed on
both fides. All the inhabitants of Hagu
enau and Weiflembourg, apprehensive left
they Ihould experience the fate of the Ly
onefe, took flight at the approach of the
Patriots, who pnrfued them under the
cannon of Fort Louis.
Many of the unfortunate fugitives were
killed by the cannon of the fortrefs,. and
were obliged to pass the whole night un
der the bare heavens before they could be
admitted.

THEATRE.
OBSERVBR Nb.'Xn.
Mr. Fenno,
The Observer withes to make a remark
to the managers of the New Theatre.
Mr. Wiguell in his introductory addrels
to the audience, the fail evening the Theatre
was opened, made the following promise:
" Great by your favor grown, the rising age,
Shall blel's the efforts of a moral stage ;
The stage in purity,âthe stage refined,
Clear'd of its dross, may charm, initnnft
mankind.
Virtue may here its brightest leflon learn,
And scouted vice, its ugliness discern."â
How far this promifehas been fulfilled, in
the Dramatic pieces exhibited, the Observer
leaves the managers to judge; hazarding an
opinion that in the moll of the performances,
he believes, they have done Will hi the selec
tion j but cannot fay as much for all.
In filling the parts with proper chara6lers,
the Observer is sensible many difficulties oc
cur ; let the managers be cautious however,
eipecially in the Grecian Daughter, an excel
lent playâMr. Fennel, Mr. Whitlock, and
Mrs. Whitlock, have their proper parts, in
the alignment ; but is it true, that, three or
four of the gentlemen characters are properly
caftThe Observer means only to hint ]
if the play is repeated, he bsgs an experi
ment, of alteration; surely it will no: be
worse, and he conjectures it will be better.
Critical as the assignation of parts is, the
Observer will make some remarks upon the
fevera! exhibitions in that refpeft, when op
portunity will admit.
He requests the managers to give some
new pieces, if they have any, as the old ones,
i'eem not to gain by repetition ; at any rate
they do not gain audience, which is one im
portant objecS for the managers.âEvery one
will approve of a repetition of the Grecian
Daughter; but for your own fakes, give
something new the next performance.
