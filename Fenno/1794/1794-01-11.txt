make the public anxious to know who are
sub eft to this harsh and indifcriir.inate pu

Convention on the 19th day of the fit ft
month, and was dispatched to all the de

orders for its immediate execution all over
the Kepubiic.âSeals have been put upon
the papers of all who have been thus ar

The number of British fubje&s, who
are liable to fuffer by this decree, is efti

and manufactureâ¢, not resident in France,
who will fuller in their property !
The minister of justice has written to all
the cantoii6 of th? Republic, to have an
exact return of all the Englilh. It is to be
hoped that a little time and reflection will
induce the Convention to mitigate the fe
veritv of the decree.
TOULON, Sept. 25.
The French army that attacked Gener

one hundred and thirty thousand men.
From before this army this able General
made a retreat, which had some circum

victory, as he took no less than twenty.

The retreat of the Prince of Cobourg

At the village of l Waltignies, the Auf

by the superior numbers of the enemy,but
they as regularly returned, and forced the
French to retire. The fourth time, how
ever, the Auftrians were obliged to give
way & retreat to a redoubt, evacuating'

SECOND LETTER.
IV. F, Hereditary
u Prince of Orange %
u Commandant General
Courts.
a more particular declaration of the prin
ciples which aniirate-him, of the objedts
to which his views are directed, add of
the conduct which it is his intention to
pursue. With refpeft to the prcfent si
tuation of affairs, the events of the war,
the confidence reposed in him by one of
the moll conlidetable cities ot Fiance,
and, above all, the wiih which is mani
fofted almoll utiiverfally in that country,
to find refuge from the tyranny, by
which it is now overwhelmed, render this
explanation on his Mujefty'a part a cel
ling and indispensable duty : âAnd his
Majelty feels additional latisfaction in
making such a declaration, from the hope
of finding, in other powers engaged with
him in the common canfe, sentiments and
views, perfectly conformable to his own.
From the firit period when his Moll
Cliriilian Majelly Louis the XVlth had
tailed his people around him, to join in
concerting meafurcs for their common
hnppinefa, the King has uniformly (hewn
by his condud the sincerity of his willies
fpr the success of so difficult, but, at the
fame time, so interelling an undertaking.
His Majelly was deeply afflicted with all
the misfortunes which eniued ; but par
ticularly when he perceived move and
more evidently, that measures, the con
sequences of which he could not disguise
from himfelf, mull finally compel him to
relinguilh that friendly and pacific fyllem
which he had adopted. The moment at
length arrived when his Majelly saw that
it was necessary for him not only to de
fend his own rights and those of his al
lies, not only to repel the unjull aggreflion
which he had recently experienced, but
that all the dearell interells of his people
imposed upon him a duty Hill more im
portant, that of exerting his efforts for the
preservation of civil society itfelf, as hap
pily eltablilhed among the nations of Eu
rope.
The designs which had been profefTed
of reforming the abides of the govern
ment of France, of eilablifhing personal
liberty and the rights of property on a
solid foundation, of fccuring to an exten
iive and populous country the benefit of
a wife legislation, and an equitable and
mild admiuiftration of its laws; all these
folutary views have unfortunately vanish
ed. In their place has succeeded a
system deltructive of all public order,
maintained by proscriptions exiles, and
confifcations without number, by arbitra
ry imprisonments, by mafl'acres, which
cannot be remembered without horror ;
and at length, by the execrable murder of
a just and beneficent sovereign, and of
the illustrious princess, who, with an un
(haken firmnefs, has (hared all the mis
fortunes of her royal consort, his pro- 1
trailed fgfferings, his cruel captivity, his
ignominious death. The inhabitants of
that unfortunate country, so long flatter
ed by promises of happiness, renewed at
the period of every frefti crime, have
found themselves plunged into an abyf6
of unexampled calamities; and neigh
bouring nations, instead of deriving a
new security for the maintenance of ge
neral tranquillity from the establishment of
a wife and moderate government, have
been exposed to the repeated attacks of a
ferocious anarchy, the natural and neces
sary enemy of all public order. They
have had to encounter aits of aggression
without pretext, open violations of all trea
ties, an unprovoked declaration of war ; in
word, whatever corruption, intrigue, or
violence could effect for the purpose so
openly avowed of fubvertmg all the insti
tutions of society, and of extending over
all the nations of Europe that confnfion
which has produced the misery of France.
. This state of things cannot exist in
France without involving all the surround
ing powers in one common danger, with
out giving them the right, without impos
ing it upon them as a duty, to Hop the
progress of an evil which exists only by
the fucceflive violation of all law and all
property, and which attacks the funda
mental principles by which mankind is held
in the bonds of civil society.âHis majesty
by no means disputes the right of France
to reform it's daws. It never would have
been his wifti to employ the influence of
external force with refpeft to the particu
lar forms of government to be eftahlilhed
in an independent country. Neither has
he now that with, excepting so far as such
interference is become>eflential to the se
curity and repose of other powers. Under
these circumstances, he demands from
France, and he demands with justice, the
termination of a fvftem of anarchy, which
has no- force but fgr the purposes of niif-
chief, unable to discharge the p-imary du
ty of all government, to reprtfs the dif
â¢orders, or to punilh the crimes which are
daily iiicreafing in the interior of the coun
try, but disposing arbitrarily of the pro
perty and blood of the inhabitants of
France, in order to disturb the tranquility,
of other nations, and to render all Europe
the theatre of the fame crimes and of the
fame misfortunes. The King demands that
some legitimate and stable government
ihould be ellabliihcd, founded on the ac
knowledged principles of universal justice,
and capable of maintaining with other
powers the aceuflomed relations of union
and of peace. Mis majesty wiflies ardent
ly to be enabled to treat for the re-efta
blilhment of general tranquility with such
a government, exercising a legal and per
manent authority, animated with the wi(h
for general tranquility, and pofleffing pow
er to enforce the observance of it's engage
ments.âThe King would propose none
other than equitable and moderate condi
tions, not such as the expenses, the rifques,
and the facrificesof the war might juitifv,
but such as his majesty thinks himfelf un
der the indifpenfible neceflity of requiring,
with a view to these confederations, and
still more to that of his own security, and
of the future tranquility of Europe.
His majesty desires nothing more sin
cerely than thus to terminate a war which
he in vain endeavoured to avoid, and all
the calamities of which, as now experienc
ed by France, are to be attributed only
to the ambition, the perfidy, and the vio
lence of those, whose crimes have ill voir ed
their own country in misery, and disgrac
ed all civilized nations. ft
As his majesty has hitherto been com
pelled to carry on war againit the people
of France co'Jeftively, to treat as enemies
all those who fuffer their property and
blood to be lavilhed in support of an un
just aggression, his majesty would fee with
infinite fatlsfa&ion the opportunity of
making exceptions in favor of the well
difpofed inhabitants of other parts of
France, as he has already done with res
pect to those of Toulon.
The King promises, on his part, the
suspension of holtilities, friendfhip, and (as
for as of events will allow, of
which the will of man cannot dispose) fe
curity and protection to all those who, by
declaring for,a monarcliical government,
(hall (hake off the yoke of a sanguinary
anarchy, of that anarchy which has broken
all the molt sacred bonds of society, dis
solved all the relations of civil life, violat
ed every right, confounded every duty ;
which uses the name of liberty to exer
cifc the most cruel tyranny, to annihilate
all property, to seize on all poffeflions,
which fpunds its power on the pretended
consent of the people, and itfelf carries fire
and sword through extensive provinces for
having demanded their laws, their religion,

an end to a fyltem of unparalleled crimes,

Friday, January 10.
Mr. Smilie presented the petition of
Ann- Ladley, praying compensation for
the services of her late husband, during
the late warâtrad and referred to the Se
cretary of the Treaiury.
Mr. Madison presented the petition of
George Taylor, jun. chief clerk in the of
fice of the Department of State, praying,
for sundry reasons therein stated, an aug
mentation of hiÂ» compensationâread and
referred to a special committee, confiding
of Mr. Madison, Mr. Foftcr and Mr.
Griffin.
Mr. Lyman moved that all the petiffons
on the fame fubjeft, be referred to the
fame committee. âAgreed
Mr. Dexter presented the petition of
Sarah Parker, widow of Lieut. Col. Par-
ker, who was wounded at the battle of
Bunker"s-Hill, and died in Boston Goal,
praying that the pension allowed to the
widows ttnd orphans of other deceased of
ficers roav be extended to herâlaid on the
table.
The petition of James and William
Smith presented by Mr. Baldwin, was
read, and with the accompanying docu
ments, referred to a feleft committee.
Some other petitions were read and re
ferred.
It being moved to go into a committee
of the whole on the eltimate-of appropri
ations.
Mr. Giles after suggesting several rea
sons in favor of separating the items in the
estimate appropriated for the support of
the civil lilt, and clifcharging the current
expenses of government, from the articles
delignated for other purposes, moved that
the House (hould now take up the rrfolu-
tipn agreed to by the committee of the
whole yellerday, and make that the sub-
jeÂ£t of a bill by itfelf.
Mr. Nicholas supported this motionâ
he urged several conlidcrations arifhig
from the situation of the membersâ : ?.n.i
the embarraflment which would attend the
deliberations of the House from blending
so many dill! net obje&s in urn kill.
It; being remarked that the next article
in the estimate was so conneifted with the
preceding, that it was necessary it Ihouid
be included in the fame bill.
Mr. Nicholas withdrew his fsccind to
the motionâand the 'House went into
committee of the wholeâMr. Trumbull
in the chair.
Mr. Boudinot moved a refblution co
vering the next article in the eilimate-â
The Item, providing for the salaries of
clerks to the Loan-Office, being objected
to âit was paflid over for the present.
This part of the eftinlate being gone
through with, Mr, Giles moved that the
committee flipuld rifeâthis motion Was
leconded by Mr. Nicholas, and supported
by Mr. Madison.
The resolution moved by Mr. Boudmot
providing that the ftim of t0*,693 dollars
and 43 cents, be appropriated for sundry
purposes was agreed to.
The committee then rose, and the House
took into consideration the two rifoluti
ons, and adopted the fame. '
Mr. Giles then moved that a conWmttee
ihouid be appointed to prepare and bring
in a bill agreeable to the two resolutions ;
this motion was agteed to and a conuWttee
appointed accordingly.
Mr. Boudinot then moved a tefolution,
the obiect of which is to direst the Secre
tary of the Treasury to lay before the
House further information refpe&irig the
Loan-Office s; this was agreed to,
Mr. Nicholas of the committee appoint
ed to examine and report, on the.comiden
tial communications of the.Preiident of
the United States, relative to Algiers,
brought in a report, which was laid on the
table.
Mr. S. Smith of the committee on the
memorial of the Relief-Committee of Bal-
timore, presented a report which was read
âhe moved that it (hoidd be read a second
time, and referred to the committee of
the whole.
Mr. Smith gave a fuccinft account of
the situation of the refugees from Cape-
Francois, and the great burthen thrown
on the citizens of Baltimore, in conse
quence of the deilitute and didreffed con
dition of these refugeesâburthens so great,
as he presumej 1 , loudly called for the inter
position of government âMr. Smith de
tailed the progress of the benevolent exer
tions of the citizens of Baltimore on this
a Retting appeal to their humanity, from
which it appears hat the unfortunate peo
ple had been relieved by the rnoft extrnor
dinary ads of benevolence and compassion
âthat the inhabitants of that town had
for more than fix months supported this
numerous body of people, and fumiflied
them with money, cloaths and the necessa
ries of life ; it is hardly poflible to do jus
tice to the affecting narative of Mr. Smith
âfuffice it to fay, that a greater scene
of misery and distress was hardly ever be
fore witnessed, nor a more noble and
prompt display of the fined feelings of the
human heart exhibited than in the relief
afforded by the citizens of Baltimore.
It was then voted that the pe'ition be
again read, a* referred to a fommittee
of the whole.A motion was made to go into commit
tee of the whole iimmediately.
Mr. Forreit fujSported the motion.
Mr. Parker observed that he was not
ready to enter into a consideration of the
lubjeft ; he house that there
are joo of the refugees in and about Nor
folk ; the people there had made very ge
nerous contributions for their relief. The
legislature of Virginia had also granted
them aid ; he thought the fiibjedk ought
to be taken up on genera! principles, and
if any thing is to be done by government
tlie circumllanccs of these person s when
ever they are, if aillreffed, ought to be
taken into consideration.
Mr. Murray replied to Mr. Parker, by
obferytng that if there were as many per
sons of the defeription under confidtra
tiort in Norfolk, as the gentleman stated,
and the legislature of Virginia has grant
ed them relief, the preemption was, that
that relief was fufficientâno application
is received from that place for the intcrpo
filion of government. But the prelent
cafe is different, an immediate application
is made ; the unfortunate perlons must be
reduced to extreme misery if no provision
is made ; that provided by the legislature
of Baltimore extends only to next month.
Some conftil utibnal objections were
made to entering into the bulinefsâthefe
were replied to by some general remarks
oa the fupsriority of the claims of huma
nity to all precedents whatever.
Kir. Madison remarked that he prefnm
ed no arguments, no efforts of oratory
were necelTary to excite emotions of be
nevolence in the mind of any member of
the house towards these unfortunate fugi
tives. He had no doubt that the feelings
of every man were alive to a sympathy for
their situation, but he remarked that the
government of the United States is a de
finite government, confined to fpecified
objefisâit is not like the state governments
whole powers are more general. Charity
is no part of the â¢ legislative duty of the
government ; it would pu/zle him to lay
his finger -on any part of the constitution
which would authorise the government to
interpose in this business ; the report of
. the. committee he observed, involved this
coDllitutional questionâWhether the mo
ney of our constituents can be appropriat
ed to any other than fpecific purposes.
He concluded his remarks by feying,
that tho' he was of opinion that the relief
, contemplated could not be granted in the
Vvv.y proposed ; yet he supposed a mode
might be adopted which would answer the
purpose wiihout infringing the constituti
on. He adverted ta the measures which
had taken place uude'r the dir ettion of the
executive.
Mr. Nicholas concurred in fenUment
with Mr. Madison. He considered the
constitution as defining the duty of the le
gislature so expressly, as that it left them
no option in the present cafe. *
Mr. Murray observed that as the states
individually cannot prevent persons from
landing on their (hores ; as the regulations
of tonnage, commerce, and foreign inter
course with nations are exclusively vetted
in the general government,he inferred that
it must inevitably follow, that the govern
ment can with perfect confiftencyaffordre
lief to those who may come in circum
flances of unavoidable necessity and dis
tress. This he considered as firm and
constitutional ground.
Mr. Boudinot supported the question
on constitutional grounds, he in (lanced
several cases which had occurred and might
occur, in which relief must be neceffariiy
granted, and that without occasioning any
doubt of the constitutionality of the bufi
ne& ; fueh as granting pensions, afford
ing relief to Indians, supporting prito n
ers, &c. He alluded to the circumstance
of the alliance between the United States
;<Â«d France, the connexion between the
citizens of the United States and that
country, &c.
Mr. Dexter stated sundry obje&ions
from the constitution. It willnot be pre
tended, he supposed, that the grant of mo
nies, on this occasion, was for the general
welfare, it is merely a private charity, he
was in favour of going into a committee
on the fubjeft, but wished a short delay,
that he might revolve the question more
fully in his own mind.
Mr. Giles enlarged on the unconftituti
onality of the power proposed to be ex
ercised by the legislature, The scope of
his argument turned on the force of an a
mendment to the constitution, which pre
cludes Congress from the exercise of pow
ers not expressly delegated. He hoped
feme expedient would be fallen upon, in
the coe.-fe of the difcuflion, withont in
volving a constitutional question as to its
legality.
His wifti wai to postpone the business.
iudden impiilfes, he remarked, often led
to aflumptions of power, which were un
warranted, and which afterwards acquired
a force extremely detrimental to the pub
lip welfare.
Mr. Murray observed that the genera]
welfare was involved in relieving any part
of the community burthened by an una
voidable neceflity. An imperious neces
sity has imposed a great burthen on the
Hate of Man-land ; any other part of the
community might have been exposed to
the fame call of humanity, and a similar
burthen thrown on them. As part of the
great whole, the general welfare is moll
undoubtedly promoted by dividing the
burthen.
Mr. S. Smith stated as a cafe in point,
the relief granted and sent to the people
of St. Domingo, on the firft infnrreftion
of the negroes.
Mr. MaJifon, in reply to Mr. Boudi
lot who had Hated several cases as in point
qbferved that thoft cases came within the
law of nations of which this government
has express cognizance, the support of
prisoners, in a cafe provided for by the
law of nations, but the present question,
he remarked, could not be considered ia
any such point of view.
The motion for going into a committee
of the whole immediately, was at length
withdrawn, and the report laid on the ta
ble.
A mefiage from the President of the li
nked States, refpedling the appointment
of a fuperintendant of the ifl'ues of sup
plies was taken into coufideration, and re
ferred to a special committee to report on
the expediency of the appointment of fuc'n
an officer.
Aiijourned till Monday.
C? It should have been noticcd in the
minute of WednefdSy's proceedings, that
Mr. Giles moved to ge into committee of

of other bulinefs.

Resolved, That the experience both of
France and America, has evinced the ab
surdity of governments within govern
ments ; as. they are calculated merely to
crate an encreafing aristocracy by multi
plying titles, places, and pensioners, who
prey like leaches, upon the vital blrtod of
the body politic, and by the numbers and
a daily increasing strength threaten every
where a total deftru&ion of the principles
of liberty and equality. That the misfor
tunes of ancient Greecc and of France,
may soon be experienced, if parts of the
grand union are allowed in future, to en
a& laws hostile to the views of freely
constituted Supreme Law-givers of the
general government of the Republic of
AmericaâTherefore resolved, that this
society do recommend to their brethren,
throughout the uuion, to consult on a
mode by which, to abolish the ridiculous
diftinftion of States within States, with
all their absurd trappings and appendages,
saving only such as may be conducive to
the Grand Union of a free government â
One and indivisible.

Resolved, That as a war between Re

the monarchical leagueâTherefore, a peace
Ihould be concluded between this republic
and that of Algiers, ct all events.
Article LII,
That this society, do recommcnd in the
moil ardent and pressing terms, the speedy
abolition of (lavery, throughout the union ;
a principle so difgraceful, and so dangerous
to. all existing liberty and equality, ought
by no means, to be fuffered to exist for a

Toulon, September 27; 1793.
Sir,
Since I closed my dispatch to you this
day, the firft division of Neapolitan troops
came into the harbor, confuting of two
thousand men, all in perfect health, con
veyed by two (hips of seventy-sour guns
each, two frigates and two sloops :âthey
have been eleven days on their pajTir>Â«.
Two thousand more treops w_ rt to fail in
three days after that of t [ ie ; r departure,
and a third 'iTviutni alio of 2000 men were
feu in twenty days from the day on
which the firft division failed. After the
confident manner in which I have ventured
to aiTure you that no impreffiou was like
ly to be made on our potts, inadequately
garrifonedas they were by our original
small body, I need hardly express the com
fortable l'ecurity I feel with our last rein.-
foi cements.
I have the honor to be, See.
MULGRAVE.
The squadron under Adm. Gell have
been delayed by contrary winds, I have
the opportunity of informing you, in ad
dition to my last dispatches, that on the
28th inft. the firft division of the Neapo
litan troops dilembarked under the ccm
mand of Brigadier-General Pignatelli.â
The troops are in perfect health, and are a
very fine body of men, and well appoint
ed.
The detachment of the King of Sar
dinia's troops consists entirely of grena
diers and chafleurs, and are of the best of
his Sardinian majefty*s troops. I have great
confidence in the zeal and willingness ex
prefTcd, both by the officers and soldiers
of this corps.
It is with extreme concern that I have
to inform you of the loss which the fei vicc
has sustained by the death of lieut. Newn
ham of the navy; to whose private and
piofeflional merits, the sincere and marked
regret of the Spanish as well as Eoglifh
officers, who were witnesses of his able &
aflive conduct, bears the moil honoura
ble testimony. His wound, which was
not at firft judged to be dangerous, took
an unfavourable turn, which proved fatal
in a very (hort period.
I have the honour to be, &c.

r undernamed cominitiee, appointed by
1 " THt SOCIfTV for the INSTITU
TION and SUPPORT of FIRST-DAY or
SUNDAY SCHOOLS in the city of Philadel
phia and the d:iiri& of Southwark and the
Northern Liberties," to solicit further fubfcrip.
lions for the support o! the schools which the
said iociety have eftabltlhed, take ibe liberty to
rcprcfent to their fellow citizensâ
That, although the schools were fufpehded
during the period of the laie avtt'ul calamity
with which our city and suburbs have been af
fi 6ted, they are now again opened lor the frep
ad million and education of poor children.
TftVt, the neccfTuy ahd reasons for the eftab*
lifttmtni of the lie (chwois are incieafrd, from the
ctrcumftance of the 4ate diftrifs having left a
number of Orphans drliitute of all the mean*
of education, fa've what the hand of benevolence
may adininilVer.
1 hat, former < xorfience has, mod plcafingly,
verified the fonddt hopes of the friends t>f this
in'Aitution, with regard 10 the progress and ad
vancement of the children, who heretofore
been under its car*, in the ufelul branches -of
education which it has afforded. Referring to
th:s faaft, and to the addrels to the public, on
this publifbed in the nVwfppers of this
cay'n the third month lalf, When about eight
hundred atnS twenty children ol both fexei hafd
partaken of the bencftts nffordedby the fovitfty,
â and about three hundr.d and twenty more were
th-n actually receiving inflruttion in their
schools, it now only remains to be ob!er\fd r
that the funds of rhe society art greatly infutfi
cicnt to cat ry on their benevolent deftgns, and
that.the committeeiotmeily appointed to foticit
fubferiptioru, concrived it ntceflVry to decline
their applteatiims to their fellow-citizens ft>r
ihdr affilhiice in favor of theft schools, in order
that thete might be no interruption from tr.cn>
to the folicuatinns then made in behaif of their
tfÂ»tforfuna!e breint cn from {'ape-Francois.
The public aid -is now therefore carneftly fo
licitcd to fuaport a chaiitaWt ettabiifhineui, cal
culated upon the principles of public and pii
vate good. The annual fubfciiption lor a mem
ber is but One Dollar ; and it is prefumcd that
so small a sum per annum cannot be better dis
posed of, by those who can afford it, than by
bellowing it as the price of the diffufion of ufeiul
â¢knowledge among the pÂ»Â»or and lriendlefs.
