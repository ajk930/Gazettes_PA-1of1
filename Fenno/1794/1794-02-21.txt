PROPOSALS
Ext'aft from the Mivutrs,
JOHN MEASE, CM.
A N D
For the Gazette of the United States.
Mr. Fen no,
In all discussions where the paflions are
those who anxieufiy seek a par
ticular and favorite object, are too ready
to atfcrib'e to their opponents motives lcfif
virtuous than those by which they are
themfekes itiftilcnced. And yet, little
>efle<fti'6n is requifitC to convince us of
the folly of fu'ch condufft- Each party
berng fixed irf a certain opinion, it is as
much the right of one fide to retort the
suspicion, as it is that of the other toffu r
gelt it. Sutfh mutual recrittiinations nei-
jjhjr convince nor throw light on the fub
jeft in cunt eft. It leaved the question where
We found it. If Peter thmks we are hound
to support France in the present war, and
Robert thinks otherwise, does it follow
that Peter is bribed by the French Mint
fter, and Robert by the Britilh ? And
will such a charge, made by the one and'
retorted by ttoe other* fettle the question ?
Peter fhoi ild make good his opinion by
reasonings, which if they do not convert
Robert, would at least convince the pub
lic, that he was right, and Robert wrong :
Robert hÂ»s ths fame right to support his
opinion and to adduce the arguments
which he desms calculated to produce
that efTeft. If they do not produce the
effect on each other, they at any rate ena
ble the publi*. to form a proper opinion.
If one citizen of a free country believes
that his nation has been insulted by a fo
reign nation ; that if is neceflary to wage
war against that nation to vindicate the
honor of his country, and that there is a
ccrtainty of fucceft: Is it not permitted
to another citizen, without being fubjeft
to the charge of furtugn influence, to
(hew that the insult has not been received,
that if it had been received, negociatioir
ftfould fifft be attempted ; that even if ne
gociation has failed, it may be more ex
i pedient for the present to endure it, than
to hazard the calamities of war. If any
citizen entertains these sentiments, is he
not bound in duty, as well as juftified, in
declaring them ? If he considers war as
the greatest of misfortunes to his country,
atod that with a littfe prudence and mode
ration, it may be avoidedâwould he act
the part of a good citizen, were to fuf.
fer the fear of unpopularity to swerve him
from his duty ? If those who are eager
for war, should overrate the Itrength of
this countiy, and underate that of the
enemy, is it criminal to (hew, that tho'
stronger in some refpe6ts, we are weaker
in others, that Â» eonteft even if fuccefsful
mull be injurious, and that the object de
sired is moie likely to be attained by peace
than war ? When Britain, in the days of
her pride, attempted to subjugate the co
lonies, thole patriots who flood forth and
exclaimed against the folly of the attempt,
who urged the strength of America for
feltdefence, and the irapotency of the
British arms and navy against us, Burke,,
Barre, Shelburne, Fox and Chatham,
were stigmatised by the war party, as ene
mies to the British glory ; we however
considered them as Britain's truest friends ;
and yet they extolled the resources of this
country, and depreciated those of their
own,
Had their counsel been purfued,Britain
'tis-probable would not haveloftwhat was
called the brightest jewel in the British
crown. But the advocates for war, by
inflaming the paflions, pride, and preju
dices of the people,, bore down all the
oppolition which was made by the virtu
ous patriots of those days, and plunged
their country into calamities, which bro't
upon the ministry the execration of that
nation.
Thus, tho' we are strong for felkde
firnce, yet if we should eitibaik in the pre-
Cent war, expose our commerce to the
fleets and cruisers which cover the ocean
âand ourfea-ports to be laid in-afhes
our revenues to be annihilatedâand our
credit destroyed, or supported with diffi
culty by recourse to a land tax. The ca

Saturday last #as i very noble day of

it is presumed, the purchafea and faff# of
produce and merchandize exceeded 53,000
dollars. Of the article of Wheat,befweeiv
25 and 30*000 buihels were brouglVf to
tin's marketâa quantity far exceeding the
receipts of any one day since the fettie
ment of this country. The price of
wheat rose durwig the <ky, from 7s. ?d.
7 s - to Bsi or the highefl: price betwÂ«ferr
this and iff March. This last mode of
purchase i* truly novel, and must be con
vincing to the former that the merchants
of this city are too independent to form
combinations.
The proffwtt of abundance of MAPLE

is faidto be very flattering. In the wes

where it receives that degree of patronage
which is due to so important a' branch of

BRUSSELS, Dec. 10.
Prince Cobourg arrived here on Satiir.-
day last, went to court in an hour after
his arrival, and in tlie evening {hewed
himfelf at the theatre, when the whole
house resounded his name in bursts- of ip
plaufe. The arch duke Charles, who was
present, was highly affected by these marks
of love for the General, and loudly joined
in the general voice.â"Phis prince, on RiÂ»
part, moved even to tears, rose, made 3
low bow to the arch duke, then
to the audience, exdaimed, " Long Live
the Emperor! Long live the archduke!"
The performance was delayed half an hour
by th< general joy,
The next ifeorning Re received
nial visits from the government and the
states. He exhorted the latter Â»t> ast with 1
all possible zeal, that the formidable ar
mies on' the frontiers might, during the
winter, be well fcpplied* He conjured"
them, in the name of the general welfare*
so jntt an end to aS difeonf with the exe
cutive and mast solemnly as
sured them, that then the Netherlands
would be perfe&ly secure from the foe.
A grand Council of War was held vet
terday, at which the Arch-Duke, tWold minister, Martha! Bender, and two o
ther generals were present ; and in the ev
ening various messengers were dispatched
to Vienna, Berlin, Ghjint, and N inpur.
This morning the Council fits again, and
the departure of Prince Cobourg for head
quarters, at Mons, is fixed for this even
ing ; his pretence being more nccefijtry
there than here.
The young Count Buckhoby, a Prufli
an officer, arrived here theday before vef
ttrdey, bringing the important news oi
the victories gained by the duke of Biunf
wiefc over the French, for three fuccelfue
da's, n-'inely, the 28th 29th and 30th.
The battle of the 30th was the mot! bloo
dy. About live in the morning, the
French, i 6,000 strong, attacked near lir
lenbach, the right wing of the Duke,
which con 11 lied of four battalions of S.ix
oiia, the Pruflian regiments of Hohenlohe
and Bmnfwick, and some Saxon cavalry,
with unextmplid fury; so that, after a
combat of four hours, and having fuffcred
great loss, the Saxons retired in disorder.
Informed of this, the duke sent General
Kalkreutb, with eight battalions of foot,
and iix fquadion of horse, to their aid.
The regiment of Hohenlohe began the
attack with the bayonet, and bovh par
ties fought furioufly till fix o'clock in the
evening. At length the left wing of the
enemy w:.ft not only repulsed, but totally
defeated by Gen. Kalkreutb, and forced,
towards midnight, to fly five leagues be
fore Lantern : 7,000 of the French re
nuÂ»neddea4 on the field; 2,000 prisoners,
1 5 cannon, and 75 caiflons were taken.
Tlm's victory, though signal, was dearly
purchased by the allies. More than jooo
men were slaughtered ; the Saxons fuffered
greatly ; the regiments of Hohenlohe and
Brunftvick alone, had 1240 men killed ;
and a battalion of Saxons was entirely cut
to pieces: Gen. Kaikreuth was mortally
wounded, and 53 officers were killed, a
mong whom was the brave Adjutant Ge-
Ti. of the duke of Brunfwick, Major
Hirciincldi who feliby a cannon ball while
receiving orders.
Next o':y the duke attacked the French
in turn, between Lautern and Landftuhl,
and after a dreadful carnage, the French
again retired wi(h the loss of 3000 killed,
and as many wounded and taken. Among
the former, whert the two French Gener-
I'iaheru and Horft. The loss of the
Pi.ulw.it, who puriued with 16 squadron
of boric, as far as Saarbruck, amounted
to 18co lulled, 2000 K'ounded, anAfome
hundreds mifling or taken.
I havejoft received a letter ftom Hague
naci, dated the 3d instant, containing an
account of the dreadful and unexampled
carnage, which- has taken place iince the
2&lli, on She Rhine. The French it is
afii roed, have loft ir> the different actions,
nearly IS,0:0 men killed, as many wound
ed, and 4000 taken prisoners. The loss
of the combined troops was little less, and
m v e rtainiy bÂ« said to amount to 16,000
m< ii killed, and wi undid. Among the
former 15S officers, Saxon, Prussian, and
Imperial, and 2\l wpunded, three of
whom vvu e generals. It further affirms,
that 011 tin- iirft of this month the French
attacked s'l the Au'irian ports,from Wan
gcntui to Hngiienau, Brumpt and Hoch
iclden ; that the Impciialifts had vigorouf
lv rcpulfed them ; that they returned to
the attack next day, hut that after a most
bloot:y aftiou, they were again driven al
inoft under the walls of Skrafbourgh. The
A uitrian General count Keglevitch, by
birth a Hungarian, and 13 other officers
were killed. Our loss in these two acti
ons amounts to 1500 men killed, and a
bout aÂ» many wounded. The loss of the
F. encli is eftimatedby Gen. Wurmfer, at
5000 killed wounded and taken.
Prince Cobourg, on reading the ac
count of these (laughters, said to his roy
al highnefi, " our victories are- deatly
purchaicd, my Lord, but these battles
were inevitable to preserve the positions
necefi'ary for the combined army during
the winter."
Tlu* 2 5;OCO men arrived ill Francoiiia,
that wive to have joined the army of the
Netherlands, have received orders to join
that of the Rhine, which cannot but be
dreadfully (hattered ; 16,c0e Pruflians al
t) have within these few days marched
from Wefel to Treves, in order to rein,
foicethc duke of Brunfwick. The duke
de Bourbon, who commanded the corps
of emigrants in the a&ion of the 2d near
Hnguenau, was wounded in the arm, and
Geu. Wurn fes exposed himfelffo far,that
lie was a'n-oft surrounded by a fqiwdron
of theei emy, but was afterwards rt-litv.
Ed by the hussars of Erdody.
Yesterday after dinner, Prince Cobourg
visited the hospitals of Brulfels, and was
not only diflatisfied, but so very angry,
that he put Captain Schoenfeld, who hau
the dirc&ion of one in which was 1800
of the wounded, uudcr arrest, with three
other officers. He lntlaiitly ordered the
Surgeon Majors to present him a plan
within Â£4 hours, for the better treatment
of these poor vittims, and exhorted the
flati s to pay attention to the dreadful mi
sery of these brave defenders of their
count!y. The negligence in the hospitals
is so great, that it (hocks humanity ; 50
or lixtv die daily for want of proper care
âthe wounded are Icarcely drelied once
a week. They lie in garrets and in the
paflages, on a little straw, covered with
rags. In a word, their iituation is dread
ful.
Ycftercl.lv a convoy of French prison
ers all wounded, arrived here, and were
thi& morning transported to Louvain.â
The)- were followed by another of thirty
five waggon load of wounded Auftrian6,
coming from before Givet, where the gar
rison of that fortrefs, 2000 ttrong, made
a faily on the 3d, and attacked the right
wing of Gen. Beaulieu, but after an ac
tion of 4 hours, were driven with consi
derable loss under the walis of the fort
refi.
The Wurmfer huffart and the Carne
ville legion performed wonders here, and
bro't off sixty prisoners. We had sixty
killed, and 120 wounded, all light troops.
I am this moment told that the depar
ture of Prince Cobourg is deferred, in
order to wait for thfc arrival of his royal
highnefsthe duke of York, and General
Beaulieu, who are expected to-morrow,to
be present at a third conference relative to
operations which they are to undertake
during the winter.
Imperial Head-Quarters at Haguenau,

This day the French gave us a moll fu
rious battle ; and the attacks were every
where most vigorously conductrd.
The conflict lalted from day-break till
late at night, when the enemy were ulti

Dec. 2âB o'clock in the evening.
Yesterday and this day, bloody actions
havebeen fought. The patriots did all
they could to break through, but they
were obliged to retreat with the loss of 7
pieces of cannon. General Count Kegle
vich was caiTied off by a cannon ball, and
the duke of Bourbon received a wound in
his hand with the stroke of a sabre.
VIENNA, Nov. 23,
The report which prevailed, that the
Prussians were going to take up their
winter-quarters in the countries of Anf

as they will, 011 the contrary, remain with
our army on the Rhine, which will now
confill of 54,000 men.

The number of the prisoners who are
now confined in the Luxembourg, is much
greater than the public Journals have hi
therto announced.
l The Duchess of Orleans occupies an
apartment close to that in which Bazire
and Chabot are (hut up. Among the
reft of the prisoners have been remarked
Laborde the Financier, Nicola, the Play
er, Prince Charles of Hesse, La Ferte,
Levy Mirepoix, a great number of Gene
rals, and the old Marlhal de Mouchy and
his wife.
Bazire and Chabot are alone in one
aparment; the reft of the rooms contain
ten or twelve prisoners each. Every pri
soner has his hammock or fling-bed, and
a small mattrafs, in comparison no bigger
than a puf&d pan-cake !
The Rich take cire of the poor ; they
all fraternize ; but every prisoner (hunt
and flies from him who was called under

The last accounts from Paris are parti
larly interelling. In the fittings of the
Jacobin Club of the 28th of November,
Barrere, the very organ of the commit
tee of public fafety, was denounced by
Balhedasas a man in whom no dependence
could be placed He represented him as
a man who only had his own interest at
heart; he had purchased property to the
amount of 600,000 livres. This is sus
picious. He was a friend of BrilTot, but
now appears among the supporters of the
Mountain ; for his maxim is always to be
of the flrongeft party. When he had
finifhed, Roberfpierre attempted the de
fence of Barrere, but found the current
of the opinions of the Club too ftrorig
against his friend, and very wifely (to es
cape a similar disgrace) declared he would
desist from defending Barrere, and defend
no one, left he should be involved in their
fate. The Club determined that Bar
rere's conduit should some future day be
taken into consideration.
Roberfpierre, in the course of the fit
ting, read a letter to BrifTot from one of
his illuttrious friends in London, in which
he laments his being arrested, and threa
tens Danton, Roberfpierre, and others,
in ca/e they persecute BrifTot, that he
will write to the bankers of Genoa and
Amsterdam, and flop the promised loan
of 17 millions which he had obtained for
them. Roberfpierre also read another let
ter from the French Princes to himfelf,
exprefiing their approbation of his con
duct, and their knowledge of his opinion
refpedling the restoration of Monarchy,
and requesting him to hold himfelf in rea
diness to deliver the city of Paris to the
Prince de Cobourg when he should reach
the vicinity of that place. However, Ro
berfpierre, assured the club, that these
letters were wrote in Paris by the enemies
of the Republic, and that he would take
the greateil care to unravel the plot, and
bring the guilty to justice.

The Culloden has gone in quell of the

mysterious in the French capturing this

They mult be in want of these goodsâor
that (he is a French-Americanâor that
they have made war against the whole

Letters received from Nantz, dated the
27th of O&ober, confirm the taking of
the iflandof Noirmontier (near the mouth
of the Loire) by the rovahltsof La Ven

from Englaud.
The lame letters mention, that the co

at Varade, carried off its artillery, ammu
nition, and baggage, without the imallelt
loss, and that they intended to go lrom
Laval towards Lower Bretagne and St.
Malo, where a formidable party waits on

selves.
Twelve thonfand republicans, coming
from La Vandee, have palled the bridges
for Nantz on their way to Rennes, to give

The earl of Yarmouth, in luslaft dil
patch, informs us, that on the 25th ult,
the left wing of the French were com
pletely routed ; and that the next day but
one the Auitrians were attacked on every

If the Immediate consequence of com
pletely routing the French be a general at
tack on 1 victorious army, it would be
much w policy to leave them alone.

By It -rs from an officer at Toulon
we learn, ha' Gen. O'Hara carried with
him froir. Gil 'tar, one thousand troojia.
The force at ,'oulon was eighteen thou
sand men on the ill inft. and great rein
forcements were d i]y expected from the
different allied powers.
Lord Mulgrave, before lie was super
seded in the chief command at Toulon,
sent a flag of truce to Gen. La Poype,
refpefting the exchange or a Britifli offi
cer that had been taken prisoner. The
officer who went was blindfolded at the
distance of four miles from the French
head-quarters. Having reached them he
was conducted into a house, and to'id that
he would soon fee the General. Shortly
after he was conducted to Ger.. La Poype,
who behaved to him with great politencis;
but there were present fix Commifiioncrs
from the National Convention, who were
ill-looking, vulgar, and rude in their man
ners. The General very politely made
tea in the evening for the Britifli officer ;
but the Commissioners would not leave
Them alone for one moment, doubtful of
the principles of their General, because he
displayed the courtesy of a gentleman.
When the officer came away, La Poype
mounted him on one of hrs belt horses ;
and he was escorted back to the French
advanced posts blindfolded as before.
ExtraA of a letter from Deux-Ponts,
November 17,
" For some days pall a movement has
been remarkedamong the Pruflians,which
made lis fufpe&fome fcciet expedition.â
A great number of scaling-ladders, ropts
iron levers, hatchets and axes, &c. were
bro't to this city and its environs. Lad
night the secret was unravelled : we were
awakened by a dreadful cannonade, which
lasted from one o'clock till Rear fix in the
morning. About 9it was reported that
the Pruflians had carried Bitfche by al
fault. The cannonade recommenccd to
wards noon, increased constantly, and
seemed to draw nearer. We then began
to doubt the truth of the report, especi
ally when we saw a great number of pro
pie arrive at the fame time, who nad fled
from the environs of the river Blies. At
lad we were informed, that the Prufliaiis
had certainly attempted to take Bitfche
by storm, but that they had not succeed
ed. This roused the courage of the
French, who immediately attacked the
corps of Pruflians near Bliefcalllc ; but,
by a movement of the duke of Brunfwick
they are in danger of being entirely cut
off."

by the Manager during his transatlantic
It is proper to commend, dnly
when merit is difplaved; and we hazard
nothing in awarding the tribute of praise
on the perform ant t: of this evening.
Do we fay too much, by suggesting
that the Manner himfelf is improved in
his theatric career ? Mrs. Whitlock in Isa
bella, was the prototype of Mrs. Siddons
âthejufteft ideas of tragic powers were
realized in the part affigncd to Mrs.
IVhitlocl. We saw with pleasure Mr.
IVh'ulock in the chara&ev of Count Bald
winâhis merits as an actor have been so
long eitablilhed, that no other praise need
be added, than the fatisfa&ion felt on his
re-appearance as a volunteer of the sock
and bilfk iit. Mr. Fennell has long been
known to fameâhe (lands unrivalled in
his cad of tragic charactersâwhen feea
in Othello, which we hope will be ere long,
he will (hew what the author meant.â
Mr. Mor<ton is a native of this countryâ
we view with fitisfaftion so promifmg- a

We have already spoken of the other

they only are deaf who cannot hear.
OBSERVERâNo. I.
MR. FENNO,
I have been an attentive observer at the
New Theatre, and, as an American, I can
not withhold an honest exprefiionof thanks
to the Managers for their exertions nndtajle,
in giving us a Theatre, equal, in point of
accommodation and elegance, to mod, and
i fecund, to very few in Europe.
The Orchestra, when compared with
those that are trans-atlantic, will not fufFer
by the comparison in any respect, and in
accuracy of lime, may be said to Hand un
rivalled. . - . . o
Every American of science and tafle,
mult do violence to the better feelings of
his heart, in fupprefling his applause for
each person who has yet appeared on the
stage. _
Americans have not been witnefles of
Tragedy, until Mrs. Whitlock peifonified
Tragedy itfelf, in the character of Isa
bella : âTor, as to the performers, we
have heretofore seen in this country, it
may be laidâ
A fubftituie ftiines hiigh*K' as a King,

u lato ihe mam <>t waters."
The performance of the Epithalamium
in the ?d ast of the Tragedy, was a spe
cimen of great judgment in the disposi
tion of the parts, and the execution was
prodigious.âWe fecmed to drop " d'u

nuific of the Spheresâ
" Wl'ich in ihcii motions likt the Angels sung,

Mr. Darly'j musical powers, are allo
nifliingly great.
Mr. Fennell in Tragedy, MelTis. IVig

Mrs. Brondhurjl, in Comic and Musical
parts, deserve particular encomiums.
Extract of a letter from a gentleman in

" There has lately been erected in this
place, a Club which calls itfelf the " Con-
Ititutional and are denominated
by others, the " Jacobin Club." They
hare publiihed their Articles, which are
in (hort hand, a declaration of their right
and their intention, to infpeft the conduÂ£fc
of the Federal Government, and kick as
much dull in its eyes as possible. It is
composed of members united by no other
bond than dilcontent, and are pricked on
the right fide, by the (harp spur of po
verty, or on the left, by the crooked spur
of ambition. It is a great political Brothel
where hacknied Bawds corrupt ignorant
virtue, and young fir.ners are con firmed by
hardened offenders. The unavoidable dis
tempers of the place are as yet confined
to its noAurnal visitants, but let " this
fire in the blood" once become universal,
and its contagion will become more dan
gcrous than tlic Philadelphia fever, anrf
occasion more Phlebotomy, a million drops
for one, than if every inhabitant ef that
city had been a patient of Dr. Rush. Not
a man of note, or of chara&cr, his, I be
lieve joined it as yet, except one or two
hair-brained politicians, to whom this is
the dernier resort for fame. They have
prevailed on William Cooper, an old ho
nest whig of '75, the nioft refpe&able
member of their body, to sign as President
pro tem; but the well meaning whig is
antiquated. The faculty for opposition
is the only power that has not quitted
him ; and this he has so long domesticated,
that he will turn it out of doors, but with
his dying breath. Indeed this dcfcription
may serve as a general chaiadleriftic of all
these associates. The dupes of the Society
are much more numerous than its villains.
Whatever temporary trouble it may occa
sion the Federalists, I think it can do but
little hurt. The people of America are
too enlightened to be misled, and too
wary to be surprized. They realize too
strongly the perfection of their present
freedom ; and their sagacity will be as
secure a guard against the craft, as theii
resolution was against the foree of its ene
mies. lam told there is a similar inttitu
tion in PhiladelphiaâGive us its outlines.

Pe ale's Museum,
HAS Lately received a number of article* j
among which are the following : That
remarkable bird called the Cut-water, or fcif
ars-bill; The Avofctte, commonly called the
Shoe-maker, because ot its bill resembling a
crooked awlâThe Long-leg?, commonly call
ed the Black-bet, having perhaps the longed legs,
in proportion to the fire of the bird, of any of
(he feathered tribeâThe Storm-finch, common
ly called mother Cary's chickenâThe Sea
fwallow, and various Gulls ; besides a variety
oi Cranes, Curlews, Snipes, Scc.
The scull of a Whale and one of its Vertebres.
An Indian hatchct made of chrylial : It is
curious that those uninformed wild people, hav
ing very little knowledge of the arts, and being
ignorant even ol the existence of iron and steel,
should be able to form such hard fubftauces in
to fanciful forms as this, and othir Indian ma
nuta&ure* now in the Museum.
A lignified Quince : The specimen (hews
what a remarkable effect a dry warm situation
has on fruit. It is now about 8 years since it
was gathered ; and it was a real quince, now be
come wood, at least in appearance.
Presented by Mrs. Manfon of Charleftown,
S. C.âa tool used by the Oiaheitans in making
their bark cloth, by pounding the bark on this
instrument of wood, Â»t produces the ribs which
resemble threads : the perfectly straight and
equal lines made in this extreme hard wood, by
men without the use of iron,are curious & won
derful.
Alio, a rope made of grass, part of the rigg
ing of a veflTel of Kamfkatka.
Presented by Dr. Hall, of Lewis-town, a Squib
in fpiriu : when this fifh was found, a number
of Hones were appended to firings or ligaments
that projected from the front of its head,which
occasioned a conjecture, as it is not furnilhed
with fufificient fins to rcfift the violence of the
tide and currents, that it fattened with these li
gaments on whatever it found at the bottom ; so
that the (tones answered the purpofeof anchors
and the ligaments of a glutinous sticky nature,
that of cables. Some of the ltones arc in the
fame phial.
A collection of Minerals and other Foflils
a*x now difplayc-d in drawers covered with glass
and in a mode which will fceure them from de
rangement. To each fpecimcn are affixed refe
rences to a book of c>efcviptions. This manage
ment of specimens of the Foflil kingdom,- ren
ders this part of the Mufcum very convenient
and fatisfaÂ£tory,and great attention will be paid
to the fvflcmatical order of them, and in mak
ing the neceflary eflays of each : Alio in giving
in a concise manner, the various uses they are
applied to ; thereby rendering them the more
intercftiug to the public.
A Living Elk, of 2 years old, is just receiv
ed. By the account which monf. Button gives
of the Elk, it appears that he was not acquaint"
ed with this American animal; he particularly
omits all notice of the curious apertures adjoin
ing the eyes of this Elk.
