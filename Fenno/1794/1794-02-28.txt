By the President of the United States of
America,
A Proclamation.
WHEREAS by information given
upon oath, it appeal's that in the
night time of the twenty second day of
November, a number of armed men hav
ing their faces blackened and being other
wile disguised, violently broke open and
entered the dwelling house of Benjamin
Wells colleftorof the revenue arifingfrom
spirits distilled within the United States,
in and for the counties of Weftmoreland
and Fayette in the dirt rift of Pennsylva
nia, and by allaulting the said colle&or
and putting him in fear and danger of his
life, in his dwelling house aforefa:d, in the
said county of Fayette did compel him to
deliver up to them his commiiiiun for col
lecting the said revenue, together with
the books kept by him in the execution
of his said duty, and did threaten to do
further violence to the said colle&or, if he
did not (hortly thereafter publicly renounce
the further execution of his said office :
And whereas several of the perpetra
tors of the laid offence are still unknown,
and the fafety and good order of society
require that such daring offenders should
be discovered and brought to justice so
that infractions of the law may be prevent
ed, obedience to them secured, and officers
proteited in the due execution of the trulls
reposed in them, therefore I have thought
proper to offer and hereby do offer a re
ward of TWO HUNDRED DOL
LARS for each of the said offenders that
lhall be discovered and brought to justice
for the said offence, to be paid to the per
son or persons who (hall firft discover and
give information of the said offenders to
any judge, justice of the peace, or other
magistrate.
And I do hereby ftri&ly charge and
enjoin all officers and minilters of justice
according as their refpeftive duties may
require, to life their best endeavors to
cause the said offenders to be discovered
apprehended and secured, so that they
may be speedily brought to trial for the
offence aforefaid.
In Testimony whereof I have
/ . \caufed the seal of the United
J States of America to be affixed
to these presents, and signed the
fame with my hand. Done at

CONGRESS
Houfc of Rcprcfcntativcs.
January 28.
In committee of the whole on Mr. Mudifon's
resolutions.
SPEECH of MR. MURRAY.
( Concluded.)
In no country that Mr. Murray recol
le&ed, did the history of the carrying
trade show us a people overflowing with
raw materials and natural wealth, inhabit
ing a new, extenlive, fertile foil, who be
came great carriers.
If we examine the causes that made Ve
nice and Genoa and other free states of
Italy, the carriers for the Weft of Europe,
through the Straits of Gibraltar, to all
the states that were rich enough to pur
chase, or refined enough to enjoy the lux
uries of Alia and the Mediterranean, we
find them, small; with no extent of ferti
lity or foil ; and with a population over
flowing, and difproportioned to the land
labor or its produce. The Hanfe-Towns,
the Dutch and the Englilh, with a few
fliades of difference, were similarly situa
ted when they became the successors to
these republics in the carrying tnide.
I Whole No. 525.]
Had all of them abounded in those bulky
raw materials which arise from a foil like
ours ; with spare population, with a great
disparity between labor and its objects,
they never would have been the great car
rying nations they were. We (hould have
seen something like that equipoise of em
ployment which the genius of our own
country leads to ; and agriculture at lead
disputing the pre-eminence with navigati
on, which in our country, is but her hand
maid.
We have, indeed seen similar habits and
systems. The insular position of Great-
Britain, her neighborhood and hostile ri
vallhip with the Dutch, who preceded her
in arts and in navigation, pointed out the
navigation ast to the Parliament, in 16 J I,
as an inllrument of resentmentâand it
seemed naturally to arise from her national
qualities.
But it is observable and important in
considering the cause which rendered that
ast advifeable, that notwithstanding her
insular situation, and her fulnefs of inha
bitants, there was wanting for half a cen
tury, that co-operation of causes, which
occurred to give it all the efficacy it has
been attended with since.
The proportion of Britilh and foreign
shipping was but little in favor of England,
till eleven years after the peace of Rvf
wick, at which period, in 1697, the Bri
tish tonnage was 144,000, and the fo
reign tonnage an 100,000. The causes
that then began forcibly to operate in fa
vor of the British, eleven years after, when
the Britilh. tonnage was 240,000, and fo
reign but 45,000, were as irrefiitible as
to that effect, as they are remote, and for
tunately so, from this country. A union
with Scotland had taken place, and in
creased her exports ; the manufactures of
the country had received great compara
tive improvements; the American filhe
ries began to improve ; âJamaica, which
is immensely important to her, and a
kingdom in itfelf, became a considerable
object ; but above all, these independent
states, who were then very growing colo
nies, became felt in the scale of national
interest, and poured their bulky materials
into her lap. Without a colonial system,
she would not have felt the benefit of her
navigation act.
With a colonial system, flie, and other
countries pofleffed of colonics, have in
ducements and employment for a dispro
portion of navigation that this country is
without, and needs not in her present
progressive state of all things. And yet
the gentleman's system looks to a naviga
tion ast, at a time, when all is convulsion
withoutâand where none, or very few of
the causes that have led to such a scheme
in other countries, are visible in our in
ternal affairs. For if we look into our
local situation, we find a mod extensive
and fertile country sparingly inhabited,
and abounding in natural wealth. If we
look at the Englilh, we find contracted
territory, redundancy of population, few
or no raw materials, and scarcity of the
necessaries of life, with large capitals, and
the greatest exertion of ingenuity in ma
nufactures.
Importation of manufa&u l es has been
our praflice, and seems, under the pre
sent degree protc&ion given to those
which are adapted to our immediate at
tempts to be our interelt. We import no
raw matei ials scarcely, nor grain nor ne
ceflaries. They on the contrary, import
almoil eveiy thing, and manufadlure eve
ry thing. In (hort, our situation is com
pletely a contrail to theirs, and it is a con
trail infinitely to our credit and comfort.
It had led his mind to a full conviction,
that all our powers would gradually ame
liorate together, and if left, as they have
hitherto been, more to the exertions of
an enterprizing spirit and feeedom, than
rigidly directed by speculation and theory
they would in the fulnefs and feafonable
nefs of time, accomplilh the extent and
grandeur of design which nature seems iÂ»
R.Kave defined at the social and political
chjratt.-rof this country.
He *"_Â» willing therefor to trust as
mvi :h as pnlESlc to the operation us
cauics wiiitli, whatever they itverr, had
hitfterto, under a fortunate ncgle&, pro
duced and a profperutis train of
th. ij*, which Jpcrtrap* hnnrua contrivance
and fpecufetiw wifdojn haJ never attained
for us. Had they wxxldicd more than
they li ne, th~v might, from the pernici
ous fiaive of i'aura'.ian, applied to a scene
wiitch had r.ct its like upon the globe, have
thwarted that course of tilings, which na
tvi; pomredout, ari.l which has been fuc
de&fuiiy puriueJ. He could notMterefore
fcc( the force of a fyflem hat certainly
ira'int to tamjiei with a condition in which,
Â« very few things excepted, he felt fatis
fied and grateful. He had dwelt the
longest on the fitneft of ast to
the pe.ent circumllances of this country,
as m, 11 of the argmnents of thole from
v.h.im he differed in opinion, were drawn
from the propriety of adopting something
extremely like one.
But even taking it for granted, which
cannot be admitted, that these relocations
afford on general principles, a well found
ed hope <if relief from commercial and na
vigation rcftraints, h- hid nohefitation in
Ci; Â«'i j, that the present it the very word
time to try the folidityof the policy It
Was bad, as it related to the chance of i>
war :âami there was reason to fear tint
no nation uculii at this moment, hold out
preat lommeicial temptations, except as
z coiiinon of joining in the war.
It was bad, as it related to a commer
ce' conteil witii other commercial nations;
for where was tile nation on whom we
could rely under such a derangement of
our trade, as this fvftem defiens ?
An alte.ation so great, in navigation,
I ''bits, employment of capital, and all
foits of commercial views, had been more
rcafoiiible and more pra&icable, if a clear
ceflily for such facrifices could be (hewn;
cr if, in y riding to the force of a juflly
exrittd refmtment against the British for
infill ts offered to our flag, the gentleman
hid given us reason to believe, that the
foiirces of negociation had been firft ex
luuftfd; h'it there still remains a hope,
that negotiation and reflection might re
medy evils, which neither had beea able
to pi event
At all events, the meditated change in
volved interefo to o*)r induftrv, not to be
hazarded 011 mere commercial theory, un
supported by the very last iK'ccflity. It
ins to be expected that any man who
lhou'.d m ike an attempt so serious as the
prefeiit, wojlid have come forward with a
lt.itrrnrnt of advantages to be derived from
the change, so great and so certain, as to
warrant some hazard in the experiment.â
'J hat where he meant to charge the llream
of ccmmc.ce and indnftrv from its piefent
bed, and exclude fupplics of manufac
ture! from one country, he would have
pointed out another channel for its cur
rent, and have told us precisely, the very
n ition fiom whose ports the new supplies
of manufa&ures were to be substituted,
ar.d on what tei ms.
The gentleman who meditated this
thorough change, ought to hive had at
least the outline, of frefh treaties in his
hand, for the old were worth nothingâ
he might thus have (hewn us the only
ground of expectation that a nation ought
to calculate onâa view of the interests
of Inch nation with which an accommo
dation of our own might he moulded into
treaty. But no such thing was either
conceived or doneâindeed it was imprac
ticable at the present time, and his mea
sures ought to have waited for a proper
time, had they been in other refpe&s a
daptcd to our policy and interests.
Hut even allowing times, and the fet
tled Hate of things abroad to have been
at this moment, such, as to permit this
meafuiement of the sober interests of all,
it would not be useless to enquire (hortly
into the probable ground of treating, fup
poling a treaty for instance with France
to be undertaken in the spirit of those re
foliitibns. He jrould not indulge any of
th;ife romantic expectations which some
fecm to place in the affection of that, or
any other nation on earth : He would
look lieadily at ber inlerejls, in order to
farm r.n opinion of â¢what Jhe would doâ
ami he would ineafuie her interests by her
own fcaW, the opinions (he had ever en
tertained since Ihe became a great maritime
power. Ever Dnce the days of Colbert,
France haÂ» looked on her Weft-Indie* as
the support of her maritime greatness.â
A jesloufy, equal to *bat of any other
country, had always appeared is her co
lonial fyltemâand a fpirh of monopoly,
which her intereiU, as a maritime power
to i\ie the term, feeined to mlpire.
The republic, by their taavigation ast,
fsem determined to adhere to the colonial
fyltem ; or if they at all relax, it is but
Â» temporary yielding to transient neciffi
tv rather than a principle of change, intro
duced by either a revolution ot govern
ment,or real and laft'.ng alterations of their
intcrelU. Their interests would be the
fame now as heretofore, and that they
meant to have a powerful marine waÂ» evi
dent from their navigation act.
He did not believe they would let us
into their Weft India trade freely, except
under circumitances like the prei'ent,
which operated on all alike. Thtv never
did permit a free export fron their iilaads
hut to the mother country, and thence
circuitoufly to others ; by thei'e means,
they were secure both of the carriage and
a cheap supply. Were a treaty now of
fered, giving a free trade to thole islands,
we would think it hazardous to discrimi
nate in their favor on that account. We
fhoiild be suspicious of an offer that flood
on a facrifice of their own interests, and
would not calculate on the permanency of
provilions, which the neceflities of war
and disorder produced, but which never
would long survive those neceflities, which
peace would remove. But there was no
such ofler; nor was now the time to digest
such a business as a treaty, if this were
an offer really made,
He would not then fancifully indulge
himfelf or his conflituents in hopes which
a view of the interests of France ftiowed
him to be fallacious, and he would not in
so serious a question suppose that they,
more than we, would ad steadily on any
other principle than intercjl,âit was the
only immortal principle in the intercourse
of nations ; it may vary its lhape and mo
dification, but never its natureâand it is
the molt ufeful as it contains a perpetual
ilunulus to honest emulation.
Had a detail been entered into by gen
tlemen on the other fide oi those provi
sions which we (hould rightfully expert of
any power, in whose favor discrimination
was intended, our judgements would have
had some employment on tixedand certain
objects ; we might from a correct view of
the benefits and temptation prefented,have
ellimatcd with some precision, though not
with perfeit accuracy, the value of that
gain which such a commutation proinifed;
but at present we were in the dark and
forefaw nothing with certainty â com
merce was to be let loose to be blown to
any quarter of the world, but its certain
direction was not to be counted upon and
could not be forefeen.
It was impofCble he observed to calcu
late the extent of the good and tile evil
but we were certain that there was not a
nation in the world ready and prepared at
present either to receive our advances, or
to supply us with manufactures if these re
solutions succeed. The only country to
which we could look as a substitute to the
British market is at present in a (late so
convulsed and in such a paroxysm of affairs
that from thence we had nothing to ex
peÂ£t, nor did be think that a treaty of
which he had heard some intimation with
that country, of justice and reciprocity
would suit the United States. Mr. Mur
ray much questioned whether any treaty
with the powers of Europe on perfect re
ciprocity, for instance with mutual duties
of, fay, five per cent, on imports would
suit our situation. Such a one would suit
those nations only in which manufattures
had obtained considerable perfection, but
would be the ruin of our infant manufac
tures which we must and ought oecafional
ly to protest, by duties varied according
to their progreflion and the probability of
the supply from them proving adequate
to our demands.
The effe&s of these resolutions on our
internal affairs immediately, would prove
that they were pernicious and a real tax
without a well founded reason. Tliey
would immediately be perceived in a di
minution of our revenue, in their .opera
tion on the value and price of goods, and
in the redu&ion of the value of our pro
duce and raw materials. The last would
be affe&ed from the discouragement of fo
reign {hipping. The firft from the inabi
lity to bring in foreign manufa&ui es, from
which a duty could be raised, because the
line of trade and correspondence being al
tered, it was impcflible to fay when cr
where the importing merchant woujd be
able to form new connexions abroad, which
were not things of a day or a year, but
required much time and mutual confidence
to mature.
The value of goodi would immediately
rife, and the merchant every where, actu
ated by the fame principle, interefi, which
ought to guide us here, would benefit by
the monopoly of goods to the injury of
the farmer.
The moment these resolutions pass, said
Mr. Murray, there is not a shop or a (lore
in Philadelphia in which every imported
article will not rife in price, fifteen per cent.
while our own produce will probably fall.
But a gentleman from Virginias( Mr. Ni
cholas) wishes to fee retrenchment; he
confeiTed, he saw no rcafon for violent felf
denial. There was no society he belie
ved in the world that could so well afford
to live well, and taite of every rational
and refined enjoyment as the citizens of
this free and happy country. The uni
versal prosperity which this very com
mcrce which is designed to be dellroyed,
diflufes throughout America, jultifies en
joyment. Very natural would it be for
the farmer to enquire the causes of this
sudden rife in the price against him. He
would be told that the British had insult
ed our flag and therefore our system of
felf-denial. Could it be answered that we
had exhausted all the gentle means of ne
gociation, or could any man lay his fin
ger on any country, i.i a map, and fay
we have a certainty that from this conn
tty we shall not only have supplies of
goods, but sure and high prices for our
country produce. This could not be said.
Where there such a country now prepar
ed and ready to fubflitute for our present
connexions, he said he would feel more
juftificd in voting for this change, for he
like every other American, had severely
felt the indignities offered to our flag, and
pods, by the British.
But said Mr. Murray it has been more
than intimated, even in this house that our
country had pursued a pusillanimous con
duct and stood in a humiliating point of
viewâHe denied it. No country on
earth stood, he believed in a more exalted
ftttion among the nations nor better sup
ported the character of a spirited people.
Could any nation be chargcd with pusilla
nimity that had declared such a neutrality
a> this country did last spring ? At a time
when all the great and formidable powers
in Europe, combining every engine of
immense force and despotism against the
French, were hovering round her borders
and seemed determined to crush her ; at a
time when (he had not one ally on earth,
and no nation received her ministers, the
United States dared to maintain a treaty,
that looked the proudest nations in the
faceâThey dared to be just, and there
was a magnanimity in venturing so far in
such times, and on so hazardous stipula
tions, that not only rescued them from e
very charge of humiliation, but in his o
pinion, added to the glory of the country
âNo, this country was not humbledâ
Like a young man of virtuous mind, and
of fortitude, just setting out into life and
business, (he comports herfelf among the
nations with dignified reserve, with amia
ble and innocent manners ; Ihe complies
with her engagements though imminent
dangerovcrhang the performance & brave
ly trusts the consequences to Providence.'
Mr. Murray concluded with observing
that the state of the debate presented no
temptation to discussion as all the points of
relative privileges and reftriftions and the
items of trade had been ably and often
itated. He had concluded that as our
trade does not at present (putting the dis
turbances of war out of the qtieftion) fuf
fcr from many reftri&ions which, when
unacquainted with the fubje<3,he thought
did existâas some of the existing restric
tions against us belonged to systems, over
which we had no certain controul, and
which it did not suit us to imitate ftriftly;
as the resolutions contemplated a change
without affording a fubllitute in any de
gree, much less to more advantage ; and
as negociation was not yet at an end,from
which he hoped for some redress; as peace
â¢was his very firjl oljtd, and he believed
I bat of his conjiituents, and asthofe resolu
tions might go to disturb it, and did not
appear to him supported by a certainty of
advantage, though followed, by great
present and certain mifchiefs, he should
vote against them.

NEW-YORK, February 2J,
Copy of a letter from a merchant in
Guernsey, to a refpe&able mercantile
house in this city, dated J in. 8, 1794.
" The only authentic news in this part
of the world is, the RECAPTURE of
TOULON, by the French Republicans,
and their success in every quarter, particu
larly against the army of Wurmfer on the
Rhine, which they obliged to retreat from
their redoubts at Hageneau on the 22d
December, and againlt the Royaliftj, who
had crofTed the Loire from La Vendee in
great numbers, and who seem to be near
ly annihilated.
" These particular are certain, and
may prove interesting (hould the Rebecca
have a (hort paflage."
We learn from Capt. Brown, of the
Rebecca, that having fallen in with a
squadron of French ships of war in the
Channel, he was obliged to go on board
the Admiral's vessel, where every thing
wore the appearance of the greatell mirth
and joy, on account of the above conquest
of wliich they had received certain nitel
ligence before their failing A gentle
man who came paflenger in the Rebecca,
farther informs, that he saw a London
paper in Gnernfey of the jth January,
which announced the retaking of Toulon ;
and that Lord Moira had returned to
England to discharge his troop 6, which
had been so long detained on board the
ships in order to form their intended junc
tion with the French rebels, as to cause
sickness and mortality to make dreadful
ravage amongfl; them.

Monday arrived the {hip Charleston,

have been favored with the following par

senger in her.âThat on the evening pre
vious to failing from that port, accounts
were received from St. Augustine, which
state, that a plot had been discover
ed, which ptemeditated the giving up of
that place to the French ; the Lieutenant
Governor of St. Johns' River, Mr. M'ln

were taken up and sent to the Havannah

CLAPTON, August 2i, 1793.
Sir,
" I WAS highly gratified by the ac
count yon were lo good as to transmit to
me, of the favorable manner in which the
news of the revolution in France was re
ceived in America, especially as at that
time there were doubts entertained on the
fubjeft. That many viewed it in an un
favorable light with you, I have no doubt,
but that a revolution, in all the eflentials
so nearly resembling your own, should not
be thought a joyful event by the Ameri
cans in general, I could not believe. Your
letter made me quite easy on the fubjeft,
and enabled me to fatisfy my friends.
Since that time there have been more re
volutions, as they may be called, in France;
"all, however, I am willing to think, favor
able to liberty and happiness, tho' at the
time I and all my friends were disposed to
forebode ill, as our particular friends were
the fufferers. The last constitution seems
now to give almoit universal latisfa&ion ;
the infurreftion seems to be nearly fup
prefled, and as to their foreign enemies,
they make light of them. Indeed, they
have only served to rouse and unite them.
" We have been alarmed with the ap
prehensions of a war with America ; but
I hope there will be wisdom on your fide
of the water, tho' little I fear an ours, to
prevent it. Both countries must be ma
terially injured by such an event, and nei
ther of them could be a gainer. This,
indeed, is the cafe with refpeft to all wars,
but more obviously so in this than in mod
others.
" I fend this by my sons, who are go
ing to find a settlement in your country.
All I have (three) will be there, and then
I (hall expett to follow soon. I cannot
give you an idea of the violence with which
every friend of liberty is prosecuted in
this country. Little of the liberty of the
press on political fubje&s is now left, and
the country in general goes heartily with
the court into all their measures ; so that
nothing but general cab
fear is approaching, wall
The fotirce ot all this evil w toi know
ledge in the lower, ai>d aÂ». aot of the
lower, orders of'the people. The French
are wifely providing ast this evil by a
system of public inltru&ion. Here even
Sunday schools begÂ»n to be reprobated,
as making the common people too know-
With much gratitnde for your commu-
nications,
I am, Sir. yours sincerely

Old England is ill at her cafe,
She a furfeit has got I can tell ye;
And the cause of Old England's aifeafc,
Is much pudding and beef in her belly;
To the French for relief she applies,
And her politic doctors allure her,
That they know where her malady lies,
And their grand Panacea fh'all cure her.
" Ah ! what Panacea so grand,
Can my old Constitution repair !'*
Why, dame ! on your head you mult Hand,
And kick up your heels in the air:
Then your health will be equal and good,
Nothing else can from ruin preserve ye ;
For EQUALITY WELL UNDERSTOOD,
Means to turn all the world topsy
TURVY.
French fraternizing the World,
IF our council with scorn is repaid,
We shall bring an old house o'er your ears:
At our bidding to swallow your trade,'
Columbia shall fend privateers.
Tippoo Sultan your fa<sfcors lhall dread,
When back'd by French blades, he shall fix a
Huge price on each Englishman's head,
In Bengal, in Rahar, and Orixa.
We'll nip the Dutch navy in Zealand;
On the demi-de/potic Stadtholder.
Set the Patriots, his guilders to steal, and
The head that looks over his shoulder.
Batavia we next will attack,
And to Ceylon establish our claim :
Fed with spices wafh'd down with arrack,
How fiercely French courage will flame !
Our Sans Culottes none shall escape,
Fleets and armies we'll fit out by dozens;
Expel the Mynheers from the Cape,
And fraternize our Hottentot Cousins.
All Africa thence we'll affright,
Scare lions with morbleus and by-gars.
And to France by degrees re-unite
The department of monkeys and tigers.
Should Spain to the Bourbons prove true,
From the Dons their Muftachios we'll crop j
Spoil Mexico eke and Peru,
And steal all the gold in their Ihop.
Great Walhington next we'll assail,
And command himtofight withallEurope;
And, if in obedience he fail, â
Whyâwe'lll'end him the axeor a new rope.
Thus around us East, Weft, North and South,
Infurredtion and anarchy fofter,
Sail to H âl with the winds in our mouth,
And old Belzebub fright with our bluster.
Should old Square-toes refine to comply,
We'll appeal to the People infernal;
And, since on Earth 'tis vain more to try,
There 'ftablilh an Union fraternal.

By a Ship arrived at Portsmouth, (N.

Ãbes, a confirmation is received of the
Evacuation of Toulonâbut that the Com
bined Forces, left a garrison in the citadel
which cannot be taken but by starvation.
This account the American Captain fays
he received from two Britilh officers on
furlough, at St. Ãbes.

A correspondent fays, that the present
is the Harvest-Time of the Citizens of
the United States. The produce of our
country was perhaps never higher in fo
reign markets, than at this time. Ac
counts from Hilpaniola fay, that great
profits are to be made on our cargoes :â
A wedge of Soap is worth four dollarsâ
a pair of Shoes, five dollars. Flour it is
said, is thirty dollarsâBeef twenty dol
lars per barrel, at Surinam. What bles
sed politics arethofe which would involve
us in a war, and thus blast, not the prof
pe<Ss merely, but the positive advantages
now enjoyed by the agricultural and other
interetts of this country.

Those who feel the true principles of
an American patriot, will at this moment
discover their attachment to the km or and
interejl of their countiy, by promoting
measures calculated to proteift our com
merce against the marauders of all nations
âand tho' the United States cannot per
haps, immediately place themfclves in a si
tuation, to contend with the maritime
ft length of all nat ions, yet they can do
much to protest their commerce, and per
haps completely rid the Atlantic of those
pirates of the Barbary States, who are
dragging our fellow-citizens into the raoft
infernal llavery.

Sir,
From a review of your letter to my pre
decessor, on the 22d day of November,
1793, it appears, that you had not then
received such definitive inftruftions, relat
ive to his communication of the 29th of
May 1792, as would enable you immediate
ly to renew the difcufiion upon the fubjeft
of it.
Suspended as this negociation has been
for so long a time, I have it in charge from
the President of the United States to re
peat the enquiry, whether any inftrudHons
have been yet received by you, for pursu
ing those discussions ? Permit me to hope
for the honor of a reply, at as early a mo
ment, as may be convenient.
