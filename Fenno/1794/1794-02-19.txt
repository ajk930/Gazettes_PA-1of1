United States for his approbation, the
enrolled b!U, entitled, " An ast providing
for the relief of such of the inhabitants of
Saint Domingo, resident within the U

support."
A meflage from the House of Repre

" Mr. President, The House ef Re
presentatives have passed a bill, entitled,

en up in committee of the whole. A vast
number of new poll roads were ordered,
without opposition. The committee then
came to the consideration of that part of
the report which relates to newspapers,
and it was moved, that the pottages of
them {hould be reduced to half a cent to
dittances not exceeding 100 miles, and
one cent for any greater di'iance. This
was advocated on the ground, that newspa
pers from the feat of government and the
large towns mutt convey more complete
information than feledions from them by
country printeis in weekly papers, and
that the editors of them not only poffÂ«*ft
more ample means of information ; but
are generally better informed. The mo
tion was opposed, from a wish to encou
rage country prefles, whose papers, it
was laid, did not lose on a comparison
with the wretched productions of the me
tropolis The committee rose without
taking a quetlion, and the House adjourn

refAuiiotis
(Mr. Ames's Speech conclnM.)
Thus we fee a total stoppage of the Weft-India
mde W9IIIII notlla:ye the ilianders. It would uf
fe it us deeply, we ihould lose t!ie laic ofour products
and of courfenol gain the carri iÂ«Â«* in our own vef
l*e!â¢Â». The object o'. the contelV would be ho nearer
0 rr*aeh than before. Inrteud, however ot a totd
itippiÂ»e of the intercourse, it might happen that
e .ch nation prohrMting the vefTclbol the oilier, some
tinrd nation would carry on the traffic in its own
bottoms While this meafuie would disarm our iyf
tem, it would make it recoil upon oarffclveÂ®. It
would in etfec^operate chiefly to o'bltru t the file
of ourpoJu-ts. Iftheyfhodd remain unfjld, it
would bi so much dead lot's ; or if the ertvft should
1 e to r .ii'e rhe prhÂ© on she confumeis, it would ei
ther Icli'jfi the confur.iption or raise up rivals in the
foppiy. The coutift as it rcfpe&s tlx: Welt India
trade is inc.?;; icl'pedt agufnil us. To embairafs
thefupply from' the United States, supposing the
wr>rft as it regards rhe planters, can no no more than
enh ince the price 01 sugar and tortv e T( afi}l other pro*
dji.'ls. The French i(lands ate now in ruins, and
the Kn?.!i!h piantcf.; !;.iv;an increased price and do'u.
b'le demand n> coiifetfiieftce. While Great-Britain
confined the c<>loi>y trade' to frerl'elf, (he eave to the
cola litlvin return a monopoly in' her consumption
6f Weft-India articles. The extra expence arising
from the severest operation of our fyrtem, is already
provided againlttwo-i'old : Like other chaigcs on
tiie prod ni\s of labor and capital, the burden will
tall on the conlumer. The luxurious and opulent
co -.fumer in Europe will r.ot regard and perhaps
WiU not know the incre.i fe of price nor the caufc of
it. "IV ;>;\v fmler whv> clears iris land and fells
l!ic lumber, will feel anv cOnvuifion in the m?rket,
m i'enlihly without being able to fnfturn it at all.
Tr is a cbmctV of Wealfh against want; of felf-denial,
between l-ixury and daily subsistence, that we pro
voke with so much Confidence of fucctfs. A man of
experience in the Weft-India trade will fee thiscon
triit more llron*lv than it.is poflible. to represent it.
One of the excellencies for which the
measure is recommended is, that it will
affect our imports. What is offered as
an argument is really an objection. Who
will mpply our wants ? Oar own manu
fa&iifes are growing, and it is a subject
of "/ a? fatisfaction that they are. But
it wo"ld he wrong to overrate their capa-
city t > cloAthe usl The fame number of
inhabitants require more and more, be;-
err.if? wealth incrtafes. Add to this the
vapid grown of our numbers, and per
haps it will be correct' to tlliihate the pro
gress of <nartufiicliirersi as only keeping
pace with that of our enereafing confump
t:on and population. It follows that we
Hi nil continue to demand in future to the
amount of our present importation. It is
not intended by the resolutions that we
fliall import from England. Holland, and
the. north of Europe do not furnifh a fuf
ticient varietv, or fufficient quantity for
our Coufuniption. It is in vain to look to
Spain, Portugal, and the Italian States.
We are expeeled to depend principally
upon France ;â¢ it is impoflible to examine
the ground of this dependance without
adverting to the present lituation of that
country. It is a fubjeft upon which I
praftife no difgaifes. but I do not think it
proper to introduce the politics of France
into this discussion. If others can find in
the scenes that pas* there, or in the prin
ciples and agents that drreft them, proper
fubjefts for amiable names and fourccs of
joy and hope m the profpefl:, 1 have no
thing to fay to it. It is an amusement
which it is net in my intention either to
dilturb or to partake of. I turn from these
horrors to examine the condition of France
in refpeft to manufa&uringy capital, and
jnduftrv. In this point of view, whatever
political improvements may be hoped for,
it cannot escape observation, that it pre
sents only a wide field of wade and desola
tion. Capital, which nfed to be food for
mantifaftmes, is become ther fuel. What
once nourished industry, now lights the
fires of civil war, and quickens the pro
grefsof deftrudtion. France is like a fliip
with a fine caTgo burning to the water's
edge, (he may be built upon anew, and
freighted with another cargo, and it will
he time enough when that (hall be, to de
pend on a part of it for our fapplv : at
present, and for many years, (lie will be
not fe much a furnifiier as a confunier. It
is therefore obvious, that we (hall import
our supplies either diredtly or iirdireftly
from Great Britain. Any obftrudtion to
tlie importation, will ruin the price which
we, who consume must bear.
That part of the argument which rests
on the supposed diflrefs of the British ma
luifaifhirerÃ m consequence of the loss of
our market, is in every view unfounded.
They would not lofc tht market in fact,
and if they diu,. should we prodigiously
exaggarate the importance of our con.
sumption to the Briti(h workmen ? Im.
portant it doubtless is, but a little attenti
on will expose the extrenk folly of the o
pinion, that they would be brought to our
feet by a trial of our felf denying fpirk.
England now fujJphmfs France in the im
portant Levant trade, in the supply of
manufaÂ£tured goods to the East and in a
great m> afure to the Well-Indies, to
Spain, Portugal, and their dependencies.
Iler trade with Rufifia has of late vastly
encreafed ; and (lie is treating for a trade
with Chinaâlo that the new demands of
English manufactures, consequent upon
the deprefiion of France as a rival, has a
mounted to much more than the whole A
merican importation, which is not three
Madifon*s
millions.
British manufactures exported Sterling.

r 775>
1789,
179Â°,
1791, r6,tf 10,000
r7 $2, 18,310,000
The ill efFedt of a fyftein of reft riÂ£t ion
and prohibition in the Well Indies has
been noticed already. The privileges al
lowed to our exports to England may be
withdrawn, and prohibitory or high du
ties imposed. Mr. Ames observed that
not ore o? our articles is a monopoly,and
noticed the effeÂ£t of counter regulations
on our produdls. He adverted particu
larly to pot and pearl ashes, and observed
on- the value of the ex ten five sale of that
article, aa it advances the clearing and
fettlcment of our new lands ; he said the
best encouragement for agriculture is a
good market.
The system before us is a ir.ifchief that
goes to the roct of our prosperity. The
merchants will fuffer by the schemes and
projects of a new theory'. Great nura
bers were deceived by the convulsions of
177 J. They are an order of citizens de
ferring better of government, than to be
involved in new coniufions. It is wrong
to make our trade wage war for our poli
tics. It is now scarcely said that it is a
thing to be fought for but a weapon to
fight with. To gain our approbation to
the fvllcm, we are told it is to be gradu
ally efiablilhed : in that cafe, it will be
unavailing. It fliould be begun with in
all its strength, if we think of l'larving
the iflamls. Drive them suddenly and by
surprize to extremity, if you would dic
tate terms, but they will prepare against a
long expected failure of our supplies.
Our nation tired of fuffering
loss and embarrsfsment for the French.
The rice growers and tobacco planters of
the south, will be, and ought to be, soon
weary of a contest which they are told is
to benefit the (hip ownerÃ of the east. The
struggle so painful to ourselves, so ineffec
tual against England, will be renounced,
and we (hall fit down with fame and loss
with disappointed passions and aggravated
complaints. War, which would then suit j
our feelings, would not suit our wesknefs.
We might peahrps find some European
power willing to make war on England,
and we might be permitted by a short alli
ance to partake the misery and the de
pendance of being a subaltern in the quar
rel. The happiness of this situation seems
to be in view when the system before us
is avowed to be the instrument of avenging
our political resentments. Thsfe who af
fect to-dread foreign irifluence will do well
to avoid a partnership in EHropeanjealou
cies and riralfhips. Courting the fritnd
fhip of the one, and provoking the hatred
cf the other, is dangerous to our real in
dependence ; for it would compel Ameri
ca to threw herfelf into the arms of the
one for prote&ion against the other. Then
foreign influence, pernicious as it is, would
be fought for, and though it (hould be
shunned, it could not be resisted. The
connections of trade form ties between in
dividuals and produce little controul over
government. They are the ties of peace,
and are neither corrupt nor corrupting.
In the course of his speech, Mr. Ames
adverted to the danger of cutting off a part
of the public revenue by the operation of
the proposed regulations.
He remarked upon the hostile tendency
of the resolutions ; we have happily es
caped from a state of the moll imminent
danger to odr peace. A falfe Hep would
lose all the security for its continuance
which we owe at this moment to the con
duit of the President. What is to save
us from war ; not our own power which
inspires terror ;,not the gentle and for
bearing spirit of the powers of Europe
at this crisis ; not the weakness of Eng
land; not her affection for this country ;
if we believe the aflurancej of gentlemen
on the other iideâWhat is it then ? It iÂ»
the iutercft of Great Britain to have A
merica for a customer, rather than an e
nemy. And it is precisely that intej-eft
which gentlemen are so eager to take a
way, and to transfer to France. And
w hat is (Iranger flilF, they fay they rtly
on that operation, as a means of produc
ing peace with the Indians and Algerines
âThe wounds inflicted on Great Britain
by our enmity, are cxpefted to excitc her
to supplicate our friendlhip and to appease
us by soothing the aniraolity of our ene-
mies
What is to produce eficfts so myftieal,
so opposite to the nature so much exceed
ing the efficacy of their pretended causes?
This wonder working paper on the table,
is the weapon of terror and deftruftion-â
like the writing on Belfhazer's wall, it is
to strike parliaments and nations with dis
may. It is to be (Ironger than fleets a
gainll pirates, or than armies against In
dians. After the examination it has un
dergone, credulity itfclf will laugh at
these pretensions.

We pretend to expect not by the force of
our reftriÂ£tions, hot by the mere shew of our
spirit, to level all the fines that have guarded
for ages the monopoly of the colony trade.
The repeal of the navigation a<st of Eng
land, which is cherilhcd as the palladium of her
which time has /endered venerable
and prosperity endeared to her people, is to
be extorted from her fears of a weaker na
tion. Tr is not to be yielded f eely, but vio
lently torn from hor, and yet the idea of a
ftruggfe to prevent indignity and loft, is conÂ»
fide red a* a chimera too ridiculous for so
ber refutation. She will not dare fay they y
to re fen t it, and gentlemen have pledged
themfclves for the certain success of the at
tempt j what is treated as a phantom is vouch
ed by ta<st. Her navigation act: is known to
have caused an immediate contest with the
Dutch, and four # defpei ate sea fights ensued,
in conference the very year of it's paflage.
How far it is an ast of aggreflion for a
neutral nation to aflift the supplies of one
neighbor, and to annoy and difttefs another,
at the crisis of a contest between the two,
which strains their strength to the utmost, is
a queftlon which we might not agree in de
ciding. But, the tendency of fueh unreafon
ab!e partiality, to cxafperare the spirit of
hoftilitv against the intruder, cannot 6e doubt
ed. The language of the French government
would not soothe this spirit.
It propofei on the sole condition of a politi
cal connexion to extend to us a part'of their
Well-India commerce. The coincidence of
our measures with their invitations, however
lingular, need no comment. Of all'men, those
are'leafl confident, who believe in the effica
cy of the regulations, and yet afleft to ridi
cule their hoftrle tendency. In the commer
cial conflict fay they, we shall surely prevail
and etfe<ftually humble Great-Britain. In open
war we are the weaker, and shall be brought
into danger, if not to ruiu. It depends there
fore according to their own rfcafoning, on
Great Britain het felf, whether she will peifift
in a struggle, which will disgrace and weaken
her, or turn it into awwarr r which will throw
the shame and ruin upon her antagonist. The
topics which furnifh argument to Ihew the
danger to out peace from the resolutions, are
too fruitful to be exhausted. But without
pursuing them further, the experience of
mankind has shewn that commercial rival
fhips which spring from mutual efforts for
monopoly, have kindled more wars and wait
ed the earth more than the spirit of conquest.
He hoped, we Ihoujd ihcw by out vote, that
we dÂ«em it better policy to feed nation-?, than
to starve them, and that we fhou'.d never be
lo unwise as to put our good customers into
a situation to be forced to make every exer
tion to do without us. By cherifliing the arts
ofpeace, we (hall acquire, and we are actual
ly acquiring the strength and refaurces for a
war. Inftend of seeking treaties, we ought
to ftiun them, for the later they (hall be so m â¢
ed, the better will be the terms, we fliall have
more to give, and more to withhold. We
have not yet taken our proper rank, nor ac
quired that con fide rat inn j which will not be
refufed us, if we persist in prudent and pacific
counsels, if we give time for ouÂ» strength to
mature itfelf. Tho' America is rising with a
giant's strength, it's bones are yet but carti
lages : By delaying ihe beginning of a con
flict, we ensure the victory.
By voting out the refolutiotu r we (hall (hew
to our own citizens, and foreign nations, that
our prudence has prevailed over our prejudi
ces, that we prefer our interests to our re
fitments. Let us aflert a genuine indepen
dance of fpint, we (Rail be falfe to our duty
and feelings as Americans, if we bafelydet
cend to a fcrvile dependance on France or
Great-Britain.

WRITTEN BY MR. J! A R WOOD.
PAST is my toil and fled each anxious pain
Since I behold my 'riendf, my home again ;
How oft, when far away my fancy fov'd,
Lur'd to this spot by every scene I lov'd,
Here on thrfe boards I trod in waking dream,
And i? J talk'd, this spot was A ill my theme.
I painted oft, in colors just and true,
Thik glorious scene, so grateful to my view ;
My pu!fe would quicken and my hofom glow ;
But the true joy T never felt 'till now.
Hard was out fate to be condemn'd to roamâ
Tho' fwect our exile, fioiti our defhn'd home;
Warm are our thanks to you who dar'd to brave
Our focr'worft (bafts,the drooping mufetofave,
Before whose phalanx superstition fled,
And fell fauaticiftn bow'U her head.
But I forget-^â
I come to plead for others, to engage
Your gen'rous caie, to aid a rising ftagc ;â¢
I come to ask, and for a num'rous band
Whom I have brought from a far diltam land,
Who have to me their fttfuie fate confign'd â
Friends, patents, all they left behind :
Giant but this boon, no sigh of fad regret
Shall reach the distant fbore, no teat* (hall wet
This happy land of promise and incfejje,
Save the glad teaisof gratitude and peace.
I fee, I read in each approving finile,
A kind aifentâl have not [oit my toil i
For them acrept my thanksâFane) alone,
In richest effortsycan conceive rny own.
Nor let the with failidions eye
And penetrating search, our faults dcfcry.
While yrt the muse aspires on infant wingâ
" The Eagle fuffers little birds to sing
Tlic trembling novice, ere tnatui'd by time,

From the Gtr.cral ddvcrPfar of this Mor
rung.
Last evening, an extra mail brought
the papers of the December Packet.
From a lially perusal of some of the
latest we have received, whicUuirc to the
6th of December, \Ve abftra& the follow
ing beads of intelligence. The Morning
Chronicle is our source of information.
On the 27th of November, in the Na
tional Convention, Robcrfpierre made a
report on the political situation of Eu
rope, as it reflects Fiance, oil which the
following decree was passed:
The National Convention declares i:
to be their constant resolution, to iheÂ»
thenifelvcs terrible to thei. cneitiies', ge
nerons to their allies, and just to all pco
The treaties now subsisting with the
United .States of America, and with the
Swiss, (hall Icrupulouffy executed.
With regard to the modifications which
have taken place, in confcquence of the
French Revolution, or the revolutionary
meafurcs taken for the maintenance of
Liberty, the Convention relies on the can
dor of the Republic and its allies.
â¢ The Coiivcnta.il enjoins its civil and
military agents, to make the territory of
France, refpecfted'by their allies, and es
pecially the Swiss CautOHS.
The Committee of Public Safety, is
charged to draw i-lofer the ties of linion
and good undemanding fubfi(ting between
the Republic and its and to fee
that the neutral powers- enjoy all the
rights ftiÂ£ufcited in. treaties.
This report fliall be printed in all lan
guages, and sent by extraordinary co-u
---i'ieiÃ, into Can*
â¢ntons.
On the iSth Amar in the name of the
committee of i>;entrfil fafety announced a
plot formed by Pitt, and the coaJefced
kings to corrupt the leading rcprefenta
tivesof the people. Bazire and Cnabot
had received, and brought to the commit
tee ioc,eeo ltvres, to put thefhfelves at
the head of a conspiracy to dissolve the
Convention. Thcfe have denounced j
lien and Launay who accepted the offers
of the coalition.
They were all fourditeÂ£led to be arretted,
In litis fitting, a letter was received
from the ei-devvarit I)uchcfs of OVkans

nectffary energy.
On the 1 ith' of November the gold

The Morning Chronicle of the 2d of
December fays, that it is now a well
known fa&, that the King of Pruflia has
withdrawn himferf from the war, under
the convv&ion that the new dodtiines of
the Jacobins cannot be overcome by force.
The Scotch Convention of Delegates

The people in. the Netherlands are called
upon by government for voluntary contri
butions to support the wai.
Both Amliiaus and Piuflians about

even those mean., failed.
NATIONAL CONVENTION
November, 24.
Some Citizens of the United States of
America came to congratulate the Con
tention on the free and candid decla
ration tlicry tad made in the name of the
French People, lo'lheir allies and neutral
powers. They requeued the eitablifh
reent of a comm'ffon, charged under the
infpedlion of the Committee of Public
Safety, to determine on commercial dif
ferences which might arise between the
Citizens of the two Republics, and swore
inviolable friendship to the French, who
Kad afllftcd them to gain Liberty. Re
ferred to the Â« mmittce of Public Safety.
On the 21 it November, Wui nfer was
attacked by 25,oob'FrenthT ; t'.i Ldes
fought with fury from -morning till four
was covered with B,coo 1!..?n. At fi-x
the French (fay Bru.il is account) were
forced to yield and retired, to their en
trenched camp,
in the afternoon,
Tlse French are in poffcfllon of Blief
caftle, Kombourg, and Deux-Ponts, in
Germany.
The Morning Chroni I- of December
4th, contains an account of the issue of
Lord Howe's manoeuvres to take the
French squadron with which he fell in on
the 18th November. By Utters from
the fleet to the 27th 'it appears that the
French got ess under cover of a fog and
the night. The Blonde French frigate
was taken by four of the frigates ot Lord
Ho\re's fleet ; but Hie does not appear to
have belonged to the French squadron.
V I E N N A, Nov. 15.
The States ofltaly, it i~ fa id, mean to
take 20,000 Swift into their service and pay.
The Imperial troop-, who are marching from
Galllcia, wif! be replaced by some K<rifian
troops. Thsy are buftly employed in the ar
senal in making ten thousand fufils, which
will be feiit to Toulon by-Trie (lie. It is af
ftrted, that before the end of March next,
the army irv the Low Countries will be rein
forced with sixty thousand men.
The grand duke of Tufcartv having joined
the coalition agamft France, the city of Leg
horn will be the arfcnal and general maga-
zine of the njaratime power*? hi the Mideter
ranean. The Republic of Genoa, which has
also declared againff France, will obtain, as
an indemnification,- the island of Coi'fica,
formerly belonged to it.
The Hungarians have given a frefh proof
of their devotion to their sovereign by a free
fift of 3,000,003, a raffing three new re
giments of from Â«-o 5030 men each.
M A N H E l M, Nov. j6.
A desperate engagement, it is laid, has
token pk-.ee near Straftmrgh, in which the
Republicans have been completely defeated
by general Wurmfer.. We wait for further
account; refpefling this action.
The account of the a&ion between the
French and general Wurmfer is confirmed.
The latter attacked the French in tliree co
lumn';, dislodged them from all the advaÂ»ta
p.ious polls which they occupied near Straf
fcurgb, zvd took polfefTion of them himfelf;
the loss of the Republicans is very con fide r
able.
We learn that on Monday last* the Praffians
made & smart attack on the fortrefs of Bitche
and penetrated as far aÂ» the' drawbridge,
which they battered down; but the Republi
cans then made lb brisk a on the riffailants
tliat the latter, nptwithftanding the 11 utmost
efforts, were obliged to retire with confide r
able Iff is. Prince Louis of PrufEa, it is faid y
was wounded in the attack.
Uionty to the
General Wurmfer's head-quarters are still
at Brumpt, and the grand magazine for the
Pruluan army before I-andau is at Bracken
thai, two leagues from hence. The bom
bardment of Landau will, it seems, recom
mence in a few days. They are now repair
ing the entrenc.hment S) which the bad wea
ther had damaged.
The subsequent accounts of the aftiorv
near Strafburgh agree that it was a very
desperate one. The Austrian huflars took
the enemy in the rear, and made a great
slaughter among them, and thus decided the
vi&orv. They took a great number of can
non on the occasion-
Worms, November 21. The account
from Deux Ponts are not! the mod favora
ble. After the fraitlefs attempt of the Prus
sians on Bitche, the French advanced as far
Blielcaftel, in the environs of
Deux* Points, where the inhabitants fled on
all lides, to avoid the fury of the Republi
cans. It is supposed that a decisive aflion
will take place to-day or to-murrow, as the
dirFerent corps of Pruflia had united to at
tack the enemy, and oppose their further
progress.
naM'y Nov. 22. His Royal highness
Mor.lieur, the Regent of France, set off on
he Bth instant, with the two lons of the
Count d'Artois, for Cadiz. Those two
young princes, it is supposed, will remain
at the court of Spain, and Monsieur wit] go
to Toulin. The Count d'Artois will Ihort
ly quit Ham, and join the Rovalifts in Brita
nv. There will without doubt be an aflerii
blage of Emigrants, who will form a nume
rous army, and reinforce-that which is en
tering into France.
Cobletrtz, Nov. 23. We are in daily ex
pectation of the arrival of 16,000 Pruilians.
According to letters from Lorraine, the
Frcnch have drawn a body of troops from
the garri I'ons from Mezieres to Metz, to
form an army of 40,000 men, which has a
train of from 50 to 60 pieces of artillery.
This army will march to the Rhine, and
support the levy iir a mass of men, women
and children. The women have 40 sous a
day, and the children 15; They are going
to publilh the third requisition througout
France.
Ollio'tlfs, Nov. 8. We received reinforce

but most of them are without arms. Those

0 Monies, K'ov. *2. The patriots are dis
pleased at,the tardiness of the operations be
fore Toulon. Three months arc now elapsed
fmce the commencement of the liege, awd
nothing has been done; not one fort is in our
power, or even a redoubt, except two or
three which the Engliih would not take pof
fellion of; thÂ£ enemy, instead of abandoning
any of their poftr., work with redoubled ardor
in ere&lng new batteries, and fortifying
themfelvcs on all iides.
We have aimoit tiniihed our new redoubt
which will fc<? mounted wit* pieces of
cannon * but that will not do: we nruft get
pQueftion of Cape Cepe, to prevent the ene
my from receiving any succours ; and the
are so conscious of the importance
of that post, that they have fixed their
camp there, which is protected by a re-
doubt of 40 pieces of cannon.
Turin, Nov. 2. General de Vins, we
learn, is advancing with io y oOC men into
Provence, towards the lea r from vhich he
is only two leagues diftancc, General St.
Andre still remains on the defenfive at Ber
ga, where the enemy harrafs him perpetu
ally. Our loss in the affairs of the 18 19th
of october has been exaggerated, as it only
amounted to I2men killed and taken; a
mongffc the latter is Prince Marficonovo,
son to tlie Neapolitan Ambafiador sit our
court.
Leghorn, Nov. 8. Yesterday the Forti
tude and Lcviathin, two Engli.'h 74 gun
ships ; the sincere, 04*24 guns ; and a Royal
French frigate, of 40, failed for Toulon.
They are under the command of Capt*
Young, and have 1640 men onboard. They
also aÂ«. 4 as a convoy to some vefTels, and,
amongst others, the Grand Duchess of Tuf
cany, which is going to the Eatt Indies.
Letters from Genoa inform us, that last
week a number of barrels of gunpowder
were found concealed at Porta Fanco,
from which it was conjectured thrt some
ill disposed per foil s had designs against the
great magazines which are in that place. In
consequence of this difcovary an Extraor
dinary Council was held, the result of which
was, that all strangers without exception,
were ordered to quit the city and port of'
Genoa, and a number of feluccas arrived
here this morning with patfengcrs from that
place.
jÃrujfehy Nov. 29. The city of Antwerp
' has followed the example of the other towns
who have adhered to the requests of his Ma
jesty. His Excellency the Miniller Pleni
potentiary received the agreeable intelli
gence last night.
PARIS, Nov. 7,
The Jews of Avignon, to put their
money out of the reach of all requisition,
had filled several coffins with it, which
they daily went to bury in their burial
ground. The people iiruck with the
weight of one these convoys, entertained
jfofpicions, and opened the coffin, which
was found to be full of fpccie. In conse
quence a narrow search was made in the
burial ground, which produced a great
quantity of gold and silver.
November 22,
A letter from Salicetti, representative
of the people at Toulon, states, that the
army is iricreafmg, and artillery and am
munition arriving daily, and that they
will soon be able to press Toulon with vi
gour.
November 26.
The council of the commons of Paris
have on the motion of Chaumette, resol
ved, that to prevent fanaticifm, all the
churehes and temples in Paris of
every description shall be (hut; that the
priests of all religions shall be responsible
for any troubles that may be excited in
Paris under the veil of religion ; and that
whoever requests the opening of a church
{hall be arretted as a fufpefttd person.â
The convention furthermore was requeu
ed to prohibit priests from exercinug any
public function.
We hear that a squadron of French
fliips of war, are arrived in the Chefapeak
after a (hort pafiage from Brest. It con
fills of two of 74, 3 frigates of 44, and
18 guns. It is said that an officer from
the Admiral, with dispatches for themi

We hear that Mr. De La Forest is

HAS Lately received a number of article?;
among which are the following : That
remarkable bird called the Cut-v*ater, or fcif
ars-bill; The Avofctte, commonly called the
Shoe-maker, because ol its bill resembling a
crooked awlâThe Long-legs, commonly call
ed the Black-bet, having perhaps the longest legs,
in proportion to the fi/e of the bird, of any of
ihe feathered tribeâThe Storm-finch, common
ly called mother Cary's chickenâThe Sca
fwallow, and various Gulls ; besides a variety
ot Oanes, Curlews, Snipes, &c.
The frull of a Whale 2nd one of its Vertebres.
An Indian hatchet made of chryftal : It is
curious that those uninformed wild people, hav
ing very little knowledge of the arts, and being
ignorant even ol the existence of iron and steel,
(hould be able to form such hard substances in
to fanciful forms as this, and other Indian ma
nuta&ures now in the Mufeuro.
The fpccimen shews
A lignified Quince
what a remarkable effe6t a dry warm situation
has on fruit. It is now about 8 years since it
was gathered ; and it was a real quince, now be
come wood, at lead in appearancc.
Pnefented by Mrs. Manfon o! Charleftown,
S. C.âa tool ufcd by the Otaheitans in making
their bark cloth, by pounding the bark on this
inftrumcnt of wood, u produces the ribs which
resemble threads : the perfectly straight and
equal lines made in this extreme hard wood, by
men without the use of iron,are curious & won
derful.
Alio, a rope made of grass, part of the rigg
ing of a veflel of Kamfkatka.
Pielented by Dr. Hall, of Lcwis-'own, a Squib
in spirits : when this filh was found, a number
of stones were appended to firings or ligaments
that projected from the front of its head,which
occasioned a conjeftute, as it is not furnilbed
wi;h fufficicnt fins to resist the violence of the
tide and currents, th-t it fattened wiÂ»h these li
gaments on whatever it found at the bottom ; so
that the stones anfwercd the purpofeof anchors
and the ligaments of a glutinous sticky nature,
that of cable.*. Some of the Hones are in the
lame phial.
A collection of Minerals and other Foflils-
a r e now dtfplayed in drawers covered with glass
and in a mode which will feeure thein frdm de

ders this part of the Museum very convenient

luterefliug to the public.
A Living Elk, of 2 years old, is just receiv
ed. By the account which tnonf. Button gives
of the Elk, it appears that he was not acquaint

JUST PUBLISHED,
By THOMAS DOBSON,
Booklelier, at the Stone House, in Second
ftreet Philadelphia.
VOLUME X. OF
Encyclopedia; or Dictionary
Of Arts, Sciences, and Miscellaneous
Literature, on a Plan entirely new ;
Br WHICH
The Different Sciences and Arts,
are digcfled into the form of
Diftinft Treaties or Systems :
THIS volume contains principles of Levels,
Liberty, Do&rine of Light, Lightning,
Locks, Logarithms, Logic, Hiilory of Lon
don, Longitude. Luther, Lydia,
Madagascar, Magic, Magnetism, Malts, His
tory of Man, Marriage, Mary, Maryland,
Masonry, Materia Medica, Meadow, Mecha
nics, with a great variety of Biographical and
Miscellaneous articles, illultrated with Twen
ty two Copperplates.
As a number ol families are (till in the
country, and it is not generally known who
arereturned. T. Dobton, solicits the favor
of the fubfenbers to call px feud for their vo
lumes, that they may be supplied as early as
poiÃble.
The tenth volume of the Encyclopedia is
now presented to the public ; but as it makes
its appcarance in an impcrfeft ft ate, some ac
count of the reason of that imperfection ftiould
be given. On the Bth of September last, the
Publisher had the misfortune of having his
Printing Office burnt down by a fire which
broke out in the neighbourhood, and a great
quantity of his printing materials destroyed,
and among other articles, the fiquies, with
which he was printing the tables of lo
garithms, belonging to the preterit volume,
were melted down by the violence of the fire.
As a supply of these could not be immediately
obtained, be was under the neceflity of pub
li filing tlie volume without thele tablks; bat
hopes he (hall be able to publifb them with the
next volume which is now in confideraMe for-
wardnefs.
The Publisher embraces this opportunity of
his grateful acknowledgments to
the generous public, for the very libei al pa
tronage with which his undertaking has been
honored; at the fame time he takes the li
berty of reprelenting to such of the fubferibers
as are in arrears, the indifpenfible necessity of
punctuality, both in taking up ihe volumes as
early as possible after publication, and of pay
ing for them when taken. Many of the fuh
fcribers having got only one, two, three, â¢
volumes, and several volumes remain unpaid.
Thus the work hangs in all its different stages
from the commencement; and though the im
portance of a few dollars may be but a trifle
to the individuals, yet the accumulation of
these trifles unpaid lays the Publisher under
very serious embarraflment, and deprives him
of the use of many Thousands of Dollars which
at this time would be of very essential service.
For these reasons the Publisher finds himfelt
under the neceflity of recurring to the original
terms of publication, and in future no vo
lumes will be delivered but only to those who
take and pay to the time o4*publication.
