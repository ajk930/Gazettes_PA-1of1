From a Correfpondcnt.
A party leader pays dearly for his ho
nors,; he must often speak one way and
look anotherâhe must sometimes be silent
when he wilhes t# speak, and sometimes
speak when he wishes to be silent. He has
a world of trouble to keep things right ;
while he is giving a lelfon to one pupil,
another runs restive ; while he is laboring
to keep A. in the right road, B. runs astray
âthe life of a driver of hungry pigs or
flupid turkics is more easy. He is obliged
to have his scouts and his rangers to recon
noitre ; if tliey get knocked on the head,
he must retreat j if they make an imprefli
on he must be ready to fnpport them ; if
they hazard too milch, or mismanage, it
is understood that he is at liberty to aban
don them and join the enemy, because it
is of consequence that he (hould not com
mit himfelf. His influence would be im
paired, if he were rashly to engage and be
defeated ; that business is therefore aflign
ed to the forlorn hopeâthey are suppos
ed to have nothing to lose, and the honor
of being the instruments is a fufficient com
pensation ; a little well applied flattery
from the leader amply rewards their labors.
If he has a point to carry which is doubt
ful, and the failure of which may derogate
from his fame, an underling is employed
to feel the ground ; he hangs aloof till he
fees how it takes, but whispers assistance
and plays the Prompterâat firft gives it
a fide wind puff, without committing him
fe/f âif that succeeds, he then likes the idea
and thinks under modifications it may do,
but still flieltere himfelf under a pro-vifo,
which may bring him fafcly off the field,
if neoeflary. He must pay a compliment
to young hands, approve their sentiments
and applaud their talents. Flattery is an
irrefiftable charm : He must now and then
support absurdities to keep his friends in
good humor, and oppose what he thinks
right, to disappoint and weaken his adver
saries. Such are the toils of a Party
Leader.
For the Gazette of the United States.
Mr. Fenno,
I was much pained at a piece in your
paper of last evening, signed Crilo. The
dilputes refpe&ing the Theatre, I fup
poftd to have been at an end long since;
and little did I think that any of dis
ciples of Fanat'uifm would have again made
their appearance to rouse into adlion the
dormant principles of fuperjlitious bigotry
and ignorance. But it seems I was mistak
en, for the quiet and peaceable principles of
the oppofers to Theatrical representations
could not endure the mortify ingrefletlion of
being defeated in theiraims by thepowerful
arguments of Reason andT*UTH without
making an expiring effort to bring forth
the worst of passions lurking in the hu
man heart to aid their miserable cause;
and if poflible induce the molt ignorant
and uninformed part of the community to
fide with them, though evidently and un
deniably against their own interest.
Finding that the legislature were deter
mined to ast as the representatives of a
free people ever ought to do, that is NOT
to pass an ast violating and infringing upon
the laws and conjlitution of the Jlate and the
unalienable rights of its citizens, the <wur
.thy Crito has come forward to found the
trumpet'of alarm anddifmay to the igno
rance, the paflions, and the prejudices
of mankind, and in cafe his juj! and rea
sonable desires are not complied with, he
intimates and threatens to pour forth all
the dreadful vengeance of his mofl terrible
â wrath! !âwhich must be terrible indeed !
But this amiable mejfenger of peace in
forms ut that " the devotees of Comus
triumph in the victory which they have
obtained," that they are " inflating the
feelings of their mourning fellow-citizens."
A rare discovery truly, and worthy of its
author !âlf by the â¢ devotees of Conuis'
[Whole No. 521.]
he means the friends of the Theatre and
such as are willing to amuse tliemfelves in
innocent recreation, I mult beg leave to
all< him to point out one single circum
stance wherein they have acted in this man
ncr* Has any insulting or triumphant
language or publications been ufcd or
made in any refpeft since the dispute was
thought to have been terminatedâ-No
But it seems some person has had the 'wfa
lent pnfumbtioaXo dare to give a chara&er
of the performers.
Here is " insulting the feelings of the
citizens with a vengeanceâWiio could
have thought that any person would have
had the brazen faced impudcnce to fay
whether the pei fonjiere acted well or ill 1
Tho' perhaps the good Crito would have
no objection to having his wondrous Vo
lenti celebrated in all the newspapers piib
lifhed on the continent.
This excellent defenderof morality hasdif
fered in hi* mode of attack from some of his
colleagues, and molt violently fell foul of
" the wealthier citizens" as'the encoura
gers of these amusements, whom he af
iures have all provided a retreat againfl
" next fummei," when he declares (be
yond all doubt from intuitive knowledge cr
infpirat'wn, or both,) that the yellow-'ferer
will again spread its deftrudive ravages
through our oity, and this he can with jus
tice aocufe them of as an attrocious crime,
since the faithful followers and firm belie
vers of his party remained to a man firm
at their pejis during that trying scene last
year ; and so great was their confidence
in their own virtues, merits ami doSrims,
that not a Jingle one was known to fly to
the country for protection andfecurity from
the contagion. But to the point, Crito
fays it is the "-wealthy" who are advo
cates for the Theatre. A great change
this, for it is not many months linpe some
of his party aflerted that the poor, the
lower, and the more infignificant classes only
were its friends, and that there was scarce
ly a wealthy or refpeaable person to be
found on that fide of the qutrftion. But
Confijlency, is a quality every person is not
born to inherit.
I have not a doubt that those persons
who are willing to amuse themfclvei at
the Theatre, have felt and do feel as sensi
bly and warmly for the late dreadful cala
mity as any other person whatever, be
they who they may.âBut at the fame
time are not quite willing to place unlimi
ted confidence in the alTertiont of such
immaculatcgeniufes as Crito, who take the
people for fools or madmen, to think they
can place the lead reliance on them,
wheu they pompously aflert with as much
aflurance as if they were special agents
of the Supreme Being, that our late cala
mity was owing to the ereaion of a The
atre, and that the continuance of drama
tic representations will inevitably bring it
on us again. I would also observe, that
while the citizens pursue their amufemenU
in an orderly peaceable manner, and with
decency, (which cannot be denied, has
been remarkably so in the cafe of the
Theatre, by any person who has the least
regard for truth) no dogmatical, a (Turning
di&ator has any business or right to in
terfere with them ; and if Crito or any of
his friends fllould " kindle a fiame" to
destroy our rights of conscience or impair
our constitution, he and they may be made
forelv to rue the day that their itch for
intermedling with the concerns of others, set
their plodding heads and hands at work,
to subvert and destroy the right of thinking
in every person but themselves.

NATIONAL AFFAIRS,
For November 1793.
The French Commonwealth
ha?, from its foundation, exhibited every
symptom of premature internal decay.â
But though uafupported by any of those
circumthnces which are supposed to con
fer liability on dates and empires, it has
hitherto been cemented by the extrava
gant exertions of felf-dcluded enthusiasts;
and though the
Recent Execution
of the leaders of the moderate party must
have fatiefied every impartial observer,
that the diiTentions in the Convention are
r tiler struggles for particular aggran
dizement than for general freedomâyet,
by silencing oppofilion, it has produced
the appearance of unanimity, and by re
moving the hope of amendment, incul
cates the neceflity of submitting to pre
sent misfortune. The decided difference
of political sentiments may be fpecified
as a reason for the feveritics exercised a
gainst the loyalifls ; but nothing could
have induced the remnant of this legiila
ture to (laughter colleagues, who, for
conduct similar to their own, had encoun
tered the execration of Europe, but the
operation of personal animosity, or the
insatiable appetite for power. The arti
cles of accusation preferred againlt them
are numerous and inconsistent; they are
at the fame time upbraided with desiring
the reiteration of the monarchy, and wilh
wishing to establish a federative Repub
lic j with fomenting the war with Eng
land, and seeking to raise the Duke of
York to the vacant throne of France.â
From such absurd contradictions we must
conclude, that the disapprobation of the
projects of Danton and Roberfpierre Â«vas
their chief offence, and the implacable re
sentment of the present rulers, the sole
motives for their condemnation. They
died as martyrs to the cause for the suspi
cion of betraying which they fuffered ; â
and as they funk, in their apprehension,
to Eternal Sleep, the ejaculation<af "Vive
la Republique," was the last which breath
ed from their lips. The merit of conspi
cuous talents, BrifTot and his aflociates
may be allowed to claim ; but too fero
cious and independent to submit to the
fvvay of the unfortunate Louis, and too
haughty and enlightened to yield to a
giddy and capricious multitude, by their
untimely fate they have expiated the guilt
they incurred by fanftioning the murder
of their sovereign, and overturning the
constitutional freedom of their country.
Poflefling fufficicnt capacity to excite the
form, they were destitute of adequate
ability and influence to direst or allay it;
and perhaps were not endowed with the
persevering wickedness requisite to ensure
popularity in the midst of the convulsions
they had raised. But the patient acqui
cfcence of the French in this measure, is
the furell proof of the ignorance of the
genuine principles of freedom which pre
vails among that people. They have seen
reprefentativej, freely nominated bythem
felves, and who (till continued to enjoy
the confidence of theii electors, tried by
a tribunal inflituted by personal enmity,
and from thence conducted to the fcaf
fold, without lefledting, that by this pro

oeeding, their favorite republicanism is
destroyed, and a tyrannical anarchy ereÂ£t
ed on its ruins. The diflipation of this
delusion may be attended by some popu
lar tumult more awful than any which
may have preceded it, and the whole of
the Nationol Convention, inflead of a -
wai;ing the tardy and uncertain vengeance
of the allied powers, become the victims
of the implacable hatred they have con
ceived against each other. To live de
spised, and to die unpitied, is the moll
heavy misfortune which can happen to
man ; and such a degree of misery is the
lot of only the mod profligate and aban
doned. When, therefore, we fay that
such was the fitnation of
Total 289
we convey the severest cerifure which can
be pafled on his character. After having
long exhibited a portion of folly and wick
edness, of ambition and weakness which
rarely combine in forming the fame cha
racter, in his last moments he appears to
have derived some relief from the (lings of
an awakened confidence, in the fond hopes
of annihilation; and, with an affeCted
courage, pronounced the period of his
death to be the happielt of his existence.
Born to support the throne he helped to
subvert ; to protest the kinsman and the
king in whose deftruftion he gloried ; to
diffufe happiness over the land he assisted
to desolate ; in the pursuit of arbitrary
power he allied himfelf to a faÂ£tion by
which he was negleCted, contemned, and
murdered. Upon such an occasion, the
contemporary observer with confidence vi
olates the hallowed dignity of the tomb,
and transmits the
Duit of Orleans
to the contempt and abhorrence of every
future generation. In the execution of
the wife of
we difcoverthe fury which still continues
to rage against that minister, who, from
the benevolence and compassion of his dif
polition, still preserved some claim to ref
peft amidst the general corruption of his
countrymen. She died like the heroine
who had participated her husband's coun
sels, and advised his measures. Awed by
her reproaches into (hame, or terrified in
to the fear of detection by their continu
ance, her judges at once delivered them
selves from remorse, and secured the pro
longation of their jurifdi&ion, by her
summary condemnation. But to enter in
to any further enumeration of maflacres
attended with uniform circumftances,would
be a disgusting and unprofitable taflc ;
though the lingular courage with which
every fufferer submitted to his fate, will
be recorded as an unparalleled precedent
of the influence of sceptical enthusiasm.
Atheism, fays a great experimental mo
ralist, islefs pernicious in its practical ef
fects than superstition. Had Lord Bacon
been now living,he might have seen reason
to rctraft his opinion. The gloomv irre
ligion of France may enter fuccefsfully in
to competition with the fanaticifm which
Mahometan imposture & Papal ignorance
inspire ; and in the votaries of all we may
remark the fame desire of difleminating
their opinions,the fame resentment against
those who presume to difient, and the
fame indifference in infliih'ng and yielding
to the stroke of death. Connected with
this sentiment, and in the intervals which
can be spared from the more serious busi
ness of proscriptions andaflaflinations, the
unextinguifhable frivolity of the national
character bnrfts forth with renovated
splendor. The institution of a new cal
endar j the erection of temples to mo
dern philosophy in lieu of those which
were consecrated to the Deity of Christi
anity ; and the worship of Parisian (trum
pets, arrayed in the insignia of the god
dess of freedom ; are the occupations
which diveriify the toils, and relax the
cares, of the legislators of France. And
the multitude ftied their blood on the
frontiers, or enjoy the revels of the me
tropolis, rejoice at the guillotine over the
lifelefs remains of their fellow-citizens, or
weep in the theatre at the exhibition of
fictitious woe, according to the varying ca
price of the diÂ£tÂ»tors by whom they are
directed.
UNITED STATES.
NORFOLK, February 12.
Late neivs from France.
On Saturday last arrived in Hampton
Roads, the French frigate Charant, of 40
gune, from Rochfort, and on Monday the
remainder of the French fleet, confilting
of the following reflels, viz.âLe Tigre,
Philip Â£ga!itt,
Roland,
of 80 guns ; Le Jean Bart, of 74 guns ;
La Concorde, of 40 guns ; LeSemilliante,
of 40 guns, Le Papillon brig, and a cor
vette. They failed from France on 26th
December lart, in company with two more
(hips of the line, who may be daily ex
pected here or at New-Yoik.
They have brought out the new Mini
ster appointed to succeed Mr. Genet; and
also Consuls for the different Diftridts of
the United States.
On their passage they have taken four
prizes, viz.âa frigate and a (loop of war
from the East-Indies, who were dispatched
express with the news of the capture of
Pondicheriy, and had on board the trea
sure and trophies taken there ; they also
captured a (hip in company with the above,
who had on board, (besides other pro
perty) 87,000 dollars ; they were sent to
France under a fufficient convoy. The
fourth was a merchantman, taken near
this coast, and whose arrival -1s hourly
looked for.
The information received hy this fleet
is, That the internal affairs of France are
now in a regular and prosperous train ;
that the Army of the Pyrtnnees, after se
veral fuccefsful battles, had entcrtd. Spain,
and conquered the whole of Catalonia,
except Barcelona ; that so rapid were the
successes of the French arms in that quar
ter, there was little doubt but that bv this
time the Cargmanole dance was perform
ing in the environs of Madrid ; that the
batteries raised againfl Toulon bad suc
ceeded in cutting off the communication
between the inner and outer harbours,
which had reduced the town to the great
est ditlrefs for provisions, the garrison was
on an allowance of 4 oz. of bread per
diem; that Toulon had twice offered to
capitulate, but the Convention having
pa)[td a decree for its total deftru&ion,
the Republican General was determined
they (hould surrender at discretion ; that
the Prussian army in Alsace meeting with
strong opposition, had given up the design
of besieging Strafbouig, had recrofTed the
Rhine, and totally quitted the territories
of the Republic ; that in Austrian Flan
ders, Courtray, Menin, and Nicupoi t wÂ».re
in poffeflion of the Republican' troops,
and Oftend close beficged ; that the Con
vention had decreed the seizure of all
goods and merchandize the manufacture
of her enemies, and placed them in the
public ftoies, paying the former owners
for them j and also that no more fliould
be admitted into France from those coun
tries during the war; that the cruizing
frigates on the coast of France had been
particularly fuccefsful; and that the Re
public, in spite of the perfidy of the Tou
lonefe, will have ready for sea by the la ft
of February, a fleet of 50 fail of the line
well manned. We also und'erftand that
M. Bompard is under arrest at Paris.
The almost impregnable lines of Weif
fembourg, which the treacherous general
Ferriere had delivered up to the Piuflians
and Germans, have been retaken by the
Republicans, who have again entered the
Dutchv of Deux Ponts, where the grand
army of the Lower Rhine have retreated.
The Swiss cantons have renewed their
treaty with the Republic, and have en
gaged themselves by the new treaty to ob
serve the ftrifteft neutrality, and to ffua.'d
with a fufficient force, all the defiles"thro'
which the enemies could enter the territo
ry of the Republic ; that an army of six
ty thousand men, which before the new
treaty guarded those defiles, has now
marched into Lower Alsace.
The laws of the Republic, were in full
vigor, and had never yet, fmce the begin
ning of the revolution been so well obeyed;
the most perfect tranquility and harmony
reign every where : the 140,000 of re
serve, being the class of citizens, from the
age of 18, to 25, are to aflemble early in
the Spring, to go to reinforce the arniiei
on the ioontiers.

Extract of a letter from a gentleman at

" Our political situation is alarming',

Extract of a letter from a gentlemaft in
Norfolk, to his friend in Richmond.
" A gentleman brings us very import
ant advice from Philadelphia ; it is that
the belligerent powers have at last agreed
upon a Congress, to be held in France,
composed of Commissioners from all the
powers at war and those in neutrality, to
treat upon a general peace. Mr. Jeffcrfon,
it isfaid, is appointed to that embafly, on
the part of the United States Further,
that the Biitdh have agreed to pay for all
our vessels taken by their piratical priva

the ports of the United States."

BALTIMORE, Feb. 20.
By a gentleman juit from Norfolk, and
who was present at the dispute between
an American Captain and Sir Charles
Knowles, commander of the Brittfh fri
gate Dedalus, refpefting a seamanâour in
formant (vvhofe veracity iÂ« undoubted)
fays, that the seaman was not pressed, but
entered freely on boar d the frigateâthat
there was no attempt made by the French
Admiral to take poirefTton of the Dedalus
âand our informant understood that mat
ters were fettled between the two consuls
so as to preserve perfect tranquility while
at that portâthat there was no horse (hot,
nor any tiring at the American brigâand
that Sir Charles Knowles had obtained a
nother hand for the American brig in
place of the one entered 011 board his {hip.
It is \vith pleasure the Editor announces
to the public, that the fortunate ticket,
No. 12,536 which was drawn a prize of

Extra&of a Letter from Cincinnati, da-

" Some few days fince,l returned from
Head-Quarters, where 1 had the great
plrafure and fatisfaction of viewing in a
wilderness, 2500 of the moll regular,
mod harmonious, and bed disciplined
troops I have ever yet beheld, either in
the United States, or any other part of
the world. The exertions of General
Wayne have been uniform and great, for
which he merits the hight (I approbation
of the country at large, but more efpeci
allyof this quarter, which sensibly feels
the benefit of the terror which his con
duel has druck into the breads of the Sa
vages ; their fears began with the firft or
ganization of the army at Legionville,
and which continued to encreafe as he ap
proached them ; at Fort Washington they
became acquainted with his Indian mode
of fighting,âthis damped their courage,
being an adoption of a plan, to them ut
terly unexpected, and considered as im
practicable to regular troops ; his line of
march from this place to Head Quarters
being circumfpeft and guarded, together
with a Ai ong garrison being recently plac
ed at their feat of triumph, have produc

they may not be frustrated, by attempt

the want of a fufficient number of men is
all we have to dread."
Saturday the 22d inllant, being the

Managers of the City Dancing Aflfem

They were honored with the company
of the President and Mrs. Walhington,
several of the Foreign Ministers, a num
ber of the members of Congress, the Se
cretaries of the treasury and of war, the
Governors of the State and of the Wes

in this city. The countenances of all
piefent, appeared perfcflly congenial
with the happy occasion.
The following toads wete drank, the

1. The dayâmay it aHways be illus

May the fetters of Slavery be bro

9. The Prefirlent of the United States
âlong may he live an example to magif

Extra6l from a Pamphlet entitled, " Old
and New Principles of Trade bow pa red."
" If these governments [of North-A
merica] pursue their advantages for Agri
culture ; if they admit the manufactures
ot Europe, rendered cheap by bounties
snd real advantages attending the arts in
rich and populous countries, without re
gard to their own manufa&ures, (which
will always be established with ease, when
their eftabhfhment is beneficial) and if
they avoid politics, they may out-wit, by
a natural conduct, a multitude of nations,
who think themselves wife because their
plans are intricate. It cannot be ufeful
for America to be noticed at present in
Europe, otherwise than by her good sense:
She (hould grow to greatness like the trees
of her wilderness, in the midd of silence
and retreat. Nothing can check her po
pulation depending npon a facility of sub
sidence; or oppress herdrength springing
from numbers, situation and knowledge.
If Europe docs not treat America with
wisdom, America would do ill, to copy
the weak example of those whom the dif
ciphne of experience has not been able to
indraft. She has the peculiar happiness
of being able to (hape hercourfe free from
the influence of her own errors, and those
of others; beginning, where all nations
may be happy to end."

NEW-YORK, February 22.
By a passenger in the (hip Sampson
from the Ead-Indies, now on her way in
to this harbor, we learn that the English
have taken Pondichery from the French,
and that the French have taken from the
English 14 fail of vessels, one of which is
an Ead Indiman.
By a gentleman from Montferat we are
informed, that the English, in pursuance
of their indru&ions, have revived, or con
sider as now exiding, the laws of Lewis
XVI. respecting trade, and that in conse
quence they seize and make prize of all
American veflels, carrying the property
of the French Islands, contrary to those
laws. They place their own frigates to
guard the trade, in lieu of the Revenue
Cutters under the old establishment. By
this pra&ice, sugar, coffee, and many o
ther articles become contraband, liable to
fcizure and confifcation, and they also ren
der the veflel and whole cargo feizable.

The town, agreeable to the request of

interelting fubjedt, and what ought to be

sentiments of the town thereon, and af
ter a candid and free discussion of the
fubjeft, came into the following resolu

(trength, wealth, and independence of the
United States.
Resolved, That a committee be ap
pointed to consider and report the state of

laid on the trade of America, by Euro

to report such resolutions as may have a
proper influence on our representatives in
Congress, to induce the passing such atts
as may tend to guard, protect, and regu
late the American commerce in general.

From Cokrespoi/dnts.
A paragraph in a late paper afiured us,
that the Protestant religion wa3 gaining
ground fait in France. Read the News
papers, and find the confirmation of this
fable, which was expected to make dupes
of us. Is the (hutting up churches pub
licly burning the bible, murdering many
priests, and abolishing the salaries of the
remainder any proof that our form of
worship gains ground there ? The worlhip
of reason, and of the goddess liberty in
the peifon of a handsome wench, the sup
pression of the sabbath, and its rights, res
toring the memory of a blasphemer of
Jesus Christ as an injured philosopher
Is this religion !
What man of the least feeling, would
not rejoice in the idea that every grain of
fait which relished his food, was in a de
gree instrumental in relieving some of his
fellow-citizens from Algerine captivity ;
and yet out Congress have refufed their
consent to an additional duty of 3 cents
per bu(hel. Good Heavens ! are gentle
men so afraid of their popularity as not to
rifle a vote for so small a tax on the whole
community for foufeful a purpose ! but ra
ther than consent to it, the merchants who
already pay the whole revenues of the
country, are to be saddled with an addi
tional tonnage upon their (hipping, molt
of which at this moment appears to be de
tained in foreign ports, unclaimed or un
proteftcd by their country.

of indifputaple authority, f 0 that the fame shall
be preserved from oblivion.
Another impeachment and the second is now
depending. An officer is charged by the late
Honfc of Representatives, who hath for many
yearÂ® been largely confided in by this state, and
hath long b< en at the head of the financial de
partment of the fame, and it imports the citi

which may be brought forward on his trial.

111. It will contain all the preliminaries and in'
cidental circumstances that may occur durin*
the trial of John Nicholfon, Esquire, Comp

thearguments of counsel on both (ides, together
