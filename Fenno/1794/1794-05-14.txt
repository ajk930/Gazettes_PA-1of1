At a Special Meeting of tlie New-York
Chamber of Commerce, May gth, 1794.
The committee of this corporation, ap
pointed to frame rcfolutions, expressive of
their sense of the great attention and regard
evidenced by the executive of the United
States, to the mercantile interests thereof;
and particularly in the appointment of ast
envoy extraordinary, tb the Court of Great
Britain; report the following refolotions:
1 ft. Itefo'ved, That a principal excellence
of republican governments, is their fupericr
tendency to preserve peace and harmony
with all mankind.
2d. Resolved, That tliis Corporation can
discover neither policy, nor justice in com
mencing hostilities against any nation before
the means of negociation have been exerted
to prevent them.
3d. Resolved, That in the present crilis,
we consider the appointment of an envoy ex
traordinary to the court of Great Britain as
one among the most powerful of these means,
having an equal view to the Peace, Interejl,
and Dignity of the Republic.
4th. Resolved, That the tal and inte
grity of the charadter felefied for this im
portant million, have ini'pired his country
men with confidence, and will, as we be*
lieve, have a happy e fit eft in bringing to a
favorable ifiue, the object of his negociations.
sth. Resolved, That if ncverthelefs, this
embafiV (hould fail to preserve to us the bles
sings of peace, yet we persuade ourselves it
cannot fall to convince all nations of our
justice and moderation; to unite our own
sentiments and efforts, and render an appeal
to arms, more honorable to us, and more
formidable to our enemies.
By order of the Committee,
JOHN 3LAGGE, Chairman.
The preceding refoluti ns being unani

KINGSTON, (Jam.) April 5.
Saturday arrived his majesty's (hip I.
phigenia, Capt. Sinclair,from the Bite of
Leogane, with four prizes in company*
names as follow, who were captured bv
her and the Mufquito on the 20th ult.
The national French brig of war l'Ac
tif, of 14 guns, and 106 i.ien, monf. Gu
bian, commander ; the ships Les Veteran
and Marihal de Levie, laden with coffee
and ftigar, and the armed brig L'Efpie
gle, of 12 guns, with some sugar and
cottou. These vessels, in company with
l'Aftif, escaped from Port-au-Prince in
the night of the 19th, and intended pufti
ing to sea. The armed brig was bound
for Port-au-Paix ; they were brought too
by -.the Iphigenia of Point Lamenton,
and carried into the road of Leogane j
they are all copper-bottomed. The Iphi
genia has 140 French prifonerson board.
On the 19th, the Iphigenia fell in with
a schooner which had on board M. Def
fburneax, Lieut. CcJ. of the regiment .d' [
Artois, and too soldiers of the regiment,
(who liad fled from Port-au-Prince) and
carried them into Archave.

provifians and lumber, prijee to the ihip

to only about 50 hogsheads of sugar, 150
â¢puncheons of rum, 600 bags of pimento,
100 ba'iis of cotton, much damaged ; and
some tons of wood.
NASSAU,( N. P. ) April 11.
In consequence of the French privateers
being permitted to carry their prizes into
the Swedifli I (land of St. Bartholomew,
we are informed, Sir John Jarvis hinted
to the Governor, that he had heard of
such things ; and that when his business at
Martinique, St. Lucia and Guadaloupe
was accomplished, which promised to be
soon, he would pay him a viiit, and make
inquiry into the reasons his excellency had
for aconduiS so hostile to the allied powers.
Our intelligence ad Js, the hint was inllant-*
ly taken ; and, as atonement for pad error,
<tl! French privateers in port were ordered
to depart immediately, and entr'arice to
thfrn or their prizes in future forbid.
CONGRESS.
House of Rrprefntati-jJi.
In committee of the whole House when Mr.
Clark's prepefition for f'.[pending the
commercial inter course between the United
States and Great Britain was uuder con
[ideration, the following obfervationt were
s made Ij Mr. J. Wad [worth :
The path to bepurfued by this country
Mr. Chairman, is, in my opinion, a plain
' One, if -reafoftj and not paflion be our
guide. We have fuffered
rights lia-v 1 s been violated :It is our duty
to seek reparation for the former, and to
vindicate the latter. But war is a calamity
of theextremeft kind ; it ought then only
to be encountered in the lalt extremity ;
every thing poflible flioitld be attempted
to avoid itâevery thing ihould be avoid
ed that vvill tend to enereafe the chance of
ite evidence.
The plainest facts demondrate that onr
raie is not out of the reach of a remedy,
by negociaqon. A revocation of the in
ftniftions of the 6th of November, and
the explanations which have been given
Concerning them, afford an aflurance that
whatever may haVe been the disposition of
the British government at cne time, war
with this country did not continue to be
its purpose..
What is the inference from such a (late
of thingsâwhy plainly thisâthat we
ought to make effe&ual preparations for
the word that may happen ; that we ought
to go t work in earned, and with vigor,
to pnt the country in a ftateof defence'â
in a poilure for serious War ; and in this
position, we ought to make one more ap
peal to the judice, the good sense of Great
Britain ; but if the gentlemen will not al
low me these exprefiions as applied toGreat
Britain, I will withdraw them, and fay
their interest. And if that fails, then,
and not before, we ought to meet with
decision and firmnefs, the only alternative
â ^âIVar.
In the mean time fir, we ought to do
nothing that can prove an obstacle to the
success of negociation ; we (houlfl not by
any rash or intemperate measure make ac
commodation on the part of Great Britain
impoflible, without dishonor ; we (hould
not so act as to force her pride, to take
lide against her reason and her interest. If
a war is to happen, unanirtiity among our
selves will be of infinite importance ; if
ourcourfebe such, as to render it manifed
to all our citizens that we have done every
thing in otir power to avoid the evil; that
we have availed ourselves of all the chances
of preferring peace, that we have done
nothing that could destroy a fingl'c one of
them, then we (hall secure unanimity ;
then may w? rely, that every nerve of the
country will be drained, every resource
cahed forth to defend ourselves, and annoy
thÂ« enemy r and here I trust I {hall not
be behind any -Han in exertion and perse
verance: But if out course be such as to
. leave a doubt, Whether the war might not
( hnve been with greater p. udeaec avoided ;
t a fofpicion that it ifltsy h?vt been precipi
tated by Violent and premature mcalures,
adieu to unanimity.
The arrivat of the calamity awakening
men's minds to its magnitude, and fublti
tating the operations of reason for those of
; p.iffion, will substitute censure for applause;
j coridemjiatioa for approbation ; the govern-,
ment will lose the confidence of the people
as having been rafli and inconsiderate.
Our efforts will be languid and feeble, our
, councils diflratftecl and disjointed, and the
lt.ift evil (hat can happen, will be an inglo
| rious, and di&dvantageous peace ; what worse
may be in the womb of time, God only
knows.
' I call on these who hear me to (hun this
> course. I know the temper of the people I
represent. I have every day communications
that shew me their extreme disapprobation
of any measure that can lessen the chance
for peace. I therefore with the greated con
fidence preditfl what will be their conduct
' on one, or on the other plan of procedure. I
' believe the temper of the citizens of the
neighboring dates is not materially different
i from that of the citizens of the date to which
I belong. I presume it will not be under
stood that the citizens of the date I came
from, aie willing tamely to submit to be
ruined by the ravages of Great Britain. No
fir, they love peace, and will court it with
warmth; but if war be unavoidable, they
will not be behind their neighbors, they feel,
and feel keenly the wrongs and injuries, and
Â» their I'efentments are strong.
1 aflc the warmed advocates for the pro
pcfed measure to form in their own minds a
jud edimate of the fubdantial value of unan
imity, of the comparative faculties of the
different parts of onr country, for military
exertions, they will not do ill to review the
example of the latft war.
For my parr 1 am refjlved whatever may
be the current of the moment, to bear my
tedimony againd all measures of a tendency
to deltrov the profpe<sl of peace.-1 consider
the one under coniiderat'on as such a mea
sure, and mean to make my opposition to it.
Let those who are bold enough to court
danger to the country, dand didinguiihed
to their fellow citizensâfrom those who,
tho' resolved to be prepared for war, and
to mee: it with fortitude when it is inevita
ble, at the fame time are resolved not to
precipitate so great an evil. I cheerfully
concede to the former all the glory, they
will have, all the responsibility of their en
terprize.
I have thus expressed my real sentiments
not attempting to torture any man's argu
ments, or wound their feelings ; and were-I
to indulge myfelf in railing at tlie British for
their un'pidifiable depredations on our trade,
I think fir, I could Vff traS3 otl'ici
gentlemen who have gone before meâl
Relieve it would be useless, and T f orbear.
The TIMES, No. XUI.
POLITICAL ECONOMY.
IN ancient Greece and Rome, labor
was the business of (laves exr.lufively.â
Mechanics, laborers on land, and even
clerks and physicians were (laves. Free
men were all soldiers, and the produuee
of tha foil, subsistence, and of course po
pulation depended on the number of (laves.
This induced these nations to save all pri
soners of war. The Greeks and Romans
with all their boaded virtue, and elegan
cies, were the Algerines and the (lave
traders of antiquity.
In the former times, as now in some
parts of the world, men labored because
they were (laves to others; in modern
free countries, men labor because they are
(laves to their own wants.
Wants promote indudry industry
gives foodâ-and food increases popula
tion. One Irish peasant will maintain a
family of 6 or 8 peifons on potatoes and
milkâbut it requires the labor of a hun
dred hands to procure the furniture, the
gardens and the delicacies of one noble
man.
It is a maxim, that the strength of a
country is in proportion to its number of
inhabitantsâ true, if the people art all
employed. But if they are not employ
ed, they are excrescences that load and
enfeeble the body politic. Do the beg
gars of a country add to its strength ?Is
Naples a more powerful date for its
30,000 Lazarones ? The business of a
state is to find employment for its people
âprocreation will need no public encou
ragement.
It is a maxim, that a man who marries
and brings up a family of children, does
a service to the stateâ true, if he edu
cates the children to business. But if he
trains them up in idleness, he does hurt
instead of goodâhe brings into the state
an additional number of hungry mouths
and unproductive hands. The bachelor
who spends Â£1000 in employing the
poor of his neighbourhood, does more
good than a father who fpcnds Â£ i 000 on
half a dozen idlers in his own family.
P. S. If a Virginia democrat lives by
the labor of 'flaÂ»es,'and a northern *rifto
crat by the labor of his own hands,
which is the most ufeful member of soci
ety ?

It is said by persons lately from Bour
deaux in France, that provisions are ex
tremely scarce,' and many parts of the
country are in great distressâparties and
factions rage with violence âand a new
party has arisen, called the Rock, and
which openly demands' a di&ator. Men
ol observation and reading have long fore
feenthis eventâit is an expedient to which
the Romans resorted in all cases of an
archy and fadion âit is now probably the
lait and only expedient to save France fiom
conqneft, and more terrible fceues of blood.
What mifcry and wretchedness mud the
Jacobins have introduced into France, to
compel a brave people to flielter
under the strong arm of dSttic power!
The addi pfs of Mr. BriffotmSis constitu
ents is nOw published, and 011 its
authenticity. This work discloses such
series of crimes, such intrigues, murders,
massacres, plunder of public and private
property, as fill every reader with horror.
The great source of the evils France now
fuffers, he ascribes veryjuftly to the tyran
ny of the Paris mob, and hired affaffim
that fllrrimr.fl inttmiVWg ttr- CcrrrvCTl
tion. This book is recommended to the
perusal of Americans ; for it cannot fail
to warn our citizens of the danger of fuf
fering legislative poroceedings to be go
verned by sudden and illegal collections of
the people.

PHILADELPHIA,
MAY 14.
A correspondent was much surprised to
hear it admitted in the House of Repre
sentatives, that out â¢oejfels would be as mucli
in danger of capture in tfie Weft-Indies as
ever, if the embargo should lie discontinued,
and yet aflerted at the fame time that it
ought to be discontinued, becaufs it was tu
con-venient to France. This might be a good
reason if we were colonies of France, or if
we were under the government of commis
sioners from the National Convention ; but
it may be doubted whether such a preference
to the interests of a foreign country over our
own is either honorable to ourselves or recon
tiliable with the duty of those who are not
representatives of the French but of the A
merican nation.
Extra ft of a letter from Bojlon, may 5.
In this day of delirium in Europe, our
nation should be more than commonly
calm, sober and deliberate.
The freedom and religion of the world
may (so far as men are instruments in pro
vidence) depend on the steady wisdom of
America.âl therefore more than ever,
regret the wretched inflammatory ftuff,
which is continually ifiuing fiom a number
of News-Papers in our country, they are
sources of vice and corruptionâthree or
four fcribblets furnifh one of these vehi
cles in this Town, with Jluff- âmiserable
tools to serve each other in climbing. May
the labors and designs of hontft patriots
prosperâand may the enemies of truth
and virtue, be confounded.
It is so clearly evident from the hiftoiy
of nations and their prsfent state, that
public Credit, founded on unblemished
public faith, is the great fpiing of indus
try, private credit, wealth and powerâ
that men must be either extremely igno

NEIVTORK, May 13.
y?"ttrrhy morning,, 9 o'clock, the Hon.
JOHN JAY, Envoy Extraordinary to the
Court of Gteat Britain, with Mr. TRUM
BDL, his Secretary, embarked for London
011 board the (hip Ohio, Capt. Kemp.
The Difinel Judge, fuchof the Judges of
the Supreme Court of this State, as were in
this City, many other Civil Officers, and an
immense coneourl'e of refpedable Citizens,
attended Mr. Jar from his house to thfcihiju
When-Ac miaiaer the
Citizens- saluted him with three cheers and
acclamations, which were repeated when the
(hip left the wharf. The citizens then pro
ceeded to the Battery, where as soon as the
Ohio arrived, Mr. Jay was saluted with a
dileharge of cannon, which was immediately
followed by three cheers from Governor's
Itland. Seldom have we seen so numerous
and refpediable a collection of Citizens ; and
such demonftrntions of a sincere desire that
the embassy may be fnccefsful.
It gives us pfeafure to add, that Mr. Jay,
on taking leave of the company, exprefled,
in a (hort address, his fenfibifity and gratitude
for their attentions, and a (lured them of his
determination to do everything in his power
to efTed the object of his million and secure
to us the bladings of peace.
Great credit is due to the citizens of New-
V ork, for the (pirit and unanimity with which
they aid at the works on Governor's Kland.
The voluntary services performed on the for
tifications amount to many thousand days
work.
The zeal of all parties in this business proves,
that howaver men may differ on speculative
points, or certain nieafures of government
of little importance, yet all men agree to put
the country in a poflureof defence. Indeed
. the difference of parties seems in reality to
be this: whether we (hall go to war before
it is necedary or not.
Agreeable to public not,;,cation, the Tam
many Socicty met at Mr. Hunter's tavern
i- ye.lerday, and, at n o'clock, \vt:!k:d in pro
:e cefticn to the Dutch church, where, to a nn

TOWN MEETING.
: Yesterday the inhabitants of this town,
1 aflembled in town meeting for the purpose
of chooling fnitable persons to represent
in General Court the year, when
i the following petfons were eledted.
Will am Tudor, William Euftis, Jo
t fepli Bkke, Thomas Edwards, Charles
, Jarvis, John Winthrop, Perez Morton.
[ Several fpiritedrefolutions were pafied â¢
i at the above meeting to prevent foreftall
ing in the public market.
GUADELOUPE.
Since our Iafl: there has been three
arrivals from Guadaloupe, which bring in
formation fiom that Idand, as'late as the
6th of April, at which time it had not
been attacked by the Bntifh, though hav
ing heard of the capture of Martinico, it
was momently expected. By some it was
supposed a feeble refinance only would be
made ; others, that it would be found dif
ficult to conquer. The fort is said to
mount 106 pieces of cannon; and the
whole Idand has plenty of provisions, at
pvefent,
We hear that the Capt. of a veflel ar
rived at Salem, in a ihort pafTage from
Guadaloupe, saw the British fleet close in
with the Idand, and during the night
heard the firing of cannon.
From Bourdeaux, Marih 18.
Yesterday arrived here the brig Diana,
Capt. Martin Pease, 4" days from Bour
dcax, where he has been detaiped several
months thc-embargo on American vel
pers brought by this vjfly, but the verbal
information of the Captain is rather gloo
my 011 the part of France. He mentions
that the French army opposed to the Soan
iards had loft ground ; that the Northern
at my remained in Jldtu quo, neither advan
cing nor retreating that the rebels were
nearly conquered ; that provisions were
very scarce at Boirrdeaux, which occa
foiled some commotions in the City ; that
for the last three weeks there was no bread
in the place. He further believed, that
this scarcity of provisions was general
throughout F/ance.
We publiflt the above intelligence, as
we received it, wliich, we conceive con
sonant to our duty. Every one will have
an opportunity of commenting on it as
he pleases. Some will be disposed to
heighten the gloomy colors on the French
fide ; and others difbeiieve it in toto.
A French gentleman, pafTenger with
Cap:.W!v P,-.| wUU a
script of his own, of which we have pro
cured a trandation. We would remind
our readers, that our informant is proba
bly unacquainted with our means of in
formation refpeding European occurren
ces.
Snbjlancc of the Manuscript.
He fays, that the Convention has been
so very busy, ever since the ift of Feb.
that it pafled none but such decrees, as
were dictated by eircumftances ; among
which was diftinguiflied that which con
demns to imprisonment, during the war
and banishment after, all such persons as
have nÂ»-t manifeftcd their avowal of the
revolution, scc. &c.
Ihe armies of the combined powers,
whose advanced pofls, were already at St.
Quentin, were in a formidable train.
Tlie duke of Brunfwick, continues our
kind informant, had by a retrograde move
ment, the better to fecore his winter quar
tcrs, gone into Alsace, and the French
had retreated forward to Strafburg.
As to the Spaniards, they have beat
too ; they have taken Collioure, Post
V enore, &c. they a-pewprcs that is, near
ly destroyed the whole army, which was
opposed to them. Rifum ! They were
*oing to make the f.ege of Perpignanâ
- the French army had been th/whole of
th* winter witho jt any provisions. *
1 he troubles of La Vendee, our intel
igencer fays, is in a formidable ilate ; they
i ha.e pofledion of th.ee-fouithj of France.
New* indeed ! The Convention was at last
very low spirited, it began to doubt of
fjccefs, and although they wanted new
levies, yet did not pre fume to demand any
thing of the nation. A very great diffi
; culty occasioned by the altonifhing want
of arms (they want arms in France, so
fiys Billy PiTt) and what they have are
i of bud quality.
The Scarcity of provisions was very great
âFrenchmen now live upon roots. Even
Paris began to feel the efFects of Famine.
Our informant, goes on to relate the
apprehensions that were entertained of a
nother mafTacre exaS/y similar to that
which took place at Paris in 1792, but
this he gives as his opinion.
Cut this opinion of his, traces a most
dreadful picture of the situation of France,
Which, he fays, " being divided between
rage and fury ; presents nothing but but
chers and vidlims."
" The Aflembly is not less divided, in
more violent disunion than that which
j waited upon 50 of its members to the
Guillotine, portending a bloody revolution
in Paiis, &c. &c."
PHILADELPHIA.
The difcufiion of the bill providing for
funding and paying the interest on the ba
lance due to the creditor Hates, agreeably
to the reports of the CommifTioners, has
engaged the attention of the House of
Reprefentatiyes for the la(t 2 or 3 days ;
this day the bill was palled to be engrofied
for a third reading.
By Capt. Keown arrived here from Char
leston, we learn that one of the men on
board hislhip who was stabbed in the affray,
(mentioned in a former paper) with fonie
Frenchmen, died the day after of the wound
he received.

The Public are cautioned to
beware of counterfeited Five Dollar Bills of

The Texture of the Paper is thicker and
waiter and it takes the ink more freely than
the genuine paper.
Tlie O. in the word Company is smaller
than thelVL and other letters of that word,
so that a line extended from the top of the O,
to touch the top of the M. would extend con
siderably above the range of the whole V/ord.
In the word United the letters are narrow
erand elofer together than the reft of the bill
The i and jf in the word promise are not
parallel, the /inclining much more Jorwaid
than the i.
The eVigraving is badly executed,the ftiokcs
of all the Letters are stronger and the devie

appears darker than in the true bills. Some
ol the Counterfeits bear date in 179! âWhere-
as the Blank was not in operation till Decern
