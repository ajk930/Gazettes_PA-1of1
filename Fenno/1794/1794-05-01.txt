For Amsterdam,
For the Gazette of the United States'
M*. Fenno,
The following article, lately appeared in
a Baltimore paperâit contains obfer
valions pertinent to the present poiture
of affairs in the United States. Ob
servations which in my opiniou, are
more worthy of attention, than the
contents of a. thouUnd columns of Eu
ropean intelligenceâwe reprobate trans
atlantic connections, politics and man
ners in appearanceâbut what is the
fact ? If we could receive an uninter
rupted supply of European Newspa
pers, it may be doubted whether it
would appear from the American pvb
lications, that the people of the Unit
ed States, exiftcd as a nation ; or had
a government, or any independent in
terests of its own. C.
from the Maryland Journal
Tj|TE (hall take the conversation of toÂ»day
VV froth the work of a celebrated modern
autrtar, varying only in a few particulars from
the original.
The young Lyjis had li-ftened to the declama
tions of the fophiits against public meafurcs and
the raoft virtuous members of the Republic, tijl
he conceivcd himfelf qualified to manage its af
fairs.
My son, said Apollodore, I learn that you burn
with a desire to reform the laws and change the
adminiftratiou. I wifli n, replied Lyiis, he&a
tingly. It is a beautiful projeil, said his father,
to give to the republic better laws than it enjoys
at pcefent,. and more virtuous men to conduct
its affairs than those who have served it with to
much celebrity in its molt disastrous periods,
and so much prudence and wisdom fmce being
veiled with Civil authorities. If it succeeds yeu
will be enabled to be ufeful to yout relations, to
your friends and to your country. The Repub-'
lie will no longer confiderSo/an as the wisest. ie
gifldtor, noi Arijlides as the juiteft citizen.
At these words theyoung roan trembled with
joy. To accomplith that ooji 61, continued A
poilodore, will it not be nectary to carry iÂ»to
the General Assembly a great variety ot infor
mation, and to have rendered eminent services
to the republic, in order to obtain ibe confrdt nee
of the people ? Without doubt, said Lyfx\ What
services then, replied his fatter, have you ever
rendered the people, that they fhouJd withdraw
their confidence from those wbo nave served it,-
to repose it in you, who have not ?â  Lyfir was si
lent to prepare au anlwer. After waiting .tonic
moments his father continued, you do noi raqk
among your ufeful information, wtiat you have
collected trom the declamations ot the fophilfs,
nor the facility with wnich you can repeat tin i
infiriuat-ions. If you believe whit ther fay,, you;
must be in pafleflion ot the proofs upon whiqh
they fu port it. Lysis seemed disconcerted he
had never heard of the pfoofs. But waving this
point, said Apollodor*?, if the matter was tÂ© piV
mote the welfare of a mercantile houle,
would fir ft think how you could fupflifh it Wjth
a capital, and establish its credit : In like, man
ner, you would think of serving the state by Tn
creafingits wealth, ana establi sh ng its credit,
such is my idea, said Lysis. Tell me then the
amount ot the revenue of the repnblic ; upon
what obje&s this jevenue is raised ; whether it
fervesto encourage ifiduftry ; whether some oh
: jefls are not too highly MXt'd {Whether diners:
might not be rendered more productive ; or
whciher ir would not be to the advantage of the|
repub'ic to derive the whole revenue from othej
â¢olÂ»j*6b than those which at present produte it ?
-You have no doubt* fully considered thefepoirits.
No, my father, I have never thought of them,
Thcfe things have not occupied the
You know at lead o pnrpofesthe revenue
isÂ£J>plied, and certainly your intentiqn is tci
dimmish alt Improper expenditores. I canrtoj
i fay that I have clearer $deas upon this acticlet
The sophists tell )ou, said Apollodore, that the
public debt consumes a. great part of the revenue
1 and think- that those tef'whom the Republic gavs
its bond% ought to hrfve received the money due
upon them, and not the persons to whom they
have been aftigrjed. You uuderftand tfiis pit*
tin&ion no doubt. Clearly said Lysis. Yoti
can resolve me the pubiic would
have been less taxed by paying the one in-pre
ference to the oth<_r. Lysis was again silent.
Since, Lysis, jyou know so little concerning
the receipts or el penfes of government, Jet us
renourtce, for tjhe the d'efigtl of procu
ringnew wealth to ttle rtptiblic by entreating
thÂ« one 01 dMniniOiing the othel. But, my-fa
thei t woujd it not be possible to cnci*afe thfc
Wealth of t'le rcpul'lic by going to war ? That
would depend on the advantages gairted over
the enemy/, and the richriefs ot the countries

which thic republic must expend in

Ycuare sight, said Lysis. Tell me then what
is the state of our army and marine, whether ic
ought to be increased, and how in time of war
the money is t* be raised to maintain it. You
will inform me also of the troops and vejels of the
enemy. I cannot recipe to you the whoJe at
once, faidLyiis. Perhabs you have it in writing,
I ftouM be vefy glad to fee it. No I have not.
I presume then that you have not yet
time to apply you! fell to Inch calculations had
the fit uaiion of our frontiers has without doubt
attra&t d your attention : you know the number
of foldieis we maintain in the different posts;
You know also that certain points arc not fuffi
ciently defended, and that there are others afe
folutcly without defence ; you will of confe
rence urge in the General Aflembly the necef
Â«ty to augment this garrison and reform that,
replied Lysis, I (hall fay that the whoie
ought to be disbanded ; they have not difchar-
their duty. And how are you fare that our
defifes arc badly guarded ? Have you been
upon the ground ? No, but I conjecture it. Ic
is propei then to re-consider this matter, and in
place of conjctture to have certainty.
You have heard that the commerce of the Re
public by the pillars of Hercules, is gteatly in
terrupted by pirates. Do you think that the
ftÂ»te ought to fit out some gallies to protefl it in
thole few? I think, said that it will be
much better to refirain it. But as the republic
lias no gold and silver mine* to refori to,â.
you are aware that the only legal way in which
it can obtain money to supply its wants or pro
mote internal mduilry is by trade ; In these mo*
dern times the power and prosperity of a ftaie
depenas greatlyon its wealth, and that wealth
uporiitt commerce. If you rcttrift the latter
you unavoidably leflen the former.
Alas ! my father, one would never be a politi
cian if it is necessary to attend to all these details.
1$ there a head of * house, replied Apollodore,
who does not watch inceflantly over the wants
of his family and the means to fupplythem ? Byt
if all these frighten you, fup'pofe in place of un
dertaking the care of BtfD,ooo families (the a
mount of those of the Republic), you were to try
whether you can put in order your uncle's, house,
whole affairs you know are in very bad condi
tion. I could bring it about immediately if m y
uncle would follow my advice. And can you
sincerely believe, Lyfi , that all the Athenians t
your uncle included, would be more easy to be
persuaded ? Beware, beware my son, left a vain
love of being distinguished by the capricious
multitude fl-oujd make you gather Jhame instead
of laurels. Are you not conscious how impru
dent and dangerous it would be to undertake tbe
great interests of a state without undc rftanding
them ; and how mueh you would have been ri
diculed had any other oerfon but a fa' her been a
witness .0 your folly ? Numerous examples will
teach ycru, that io offices the most injpoj d ijt,
admiration and efleem are the fiuit of knowledge arid
wi/dfim, blame and contcmpt of ignorance and pre
emption. ,
Lysis took leave of his father, and rejoined the
declaimers, who excited the multiude to difor*
and difQbedience, the fliortcft road tqpo
pularity and aJhare in the adrninijlrahon.
1 fhutahook vyh'ch I, never open without re
ceKrhg inftfu&jota, to feik amusement in tjie
convf rfa:K>n of my fellow-citizens. I listened,
and he*rdtn all companies, complaints on tVie
depredations on our trade, by the fubje&s of
powers who woyld have the United $tafa to con
fiderthem as Jriendh-, but among iht various
modes of Felief, which were eiery whece fi|g
gefted, none of them seemed to me capable of
oi>taining^ij/2*cror affording prQlcttion. *
The: prcfcot is rartainlv a critical moment to
thiscpuntry, and the afpqfl aflvmed by Qrcat
llritain well calculated to lead to hostilities.
Admitting, hoWever*, the Spoliations of her ft*b
: je&s to have been authorised by 'heir coart, still
by prudence* andÂ£rwK(/i, and solid, preparations,
we may compel and aÂ«ert wa< ? b>ut
to procure the one and prevent the other,, it v_ill
be absolutely necessary to combine and employ
thfrwholeefficacy of these several agents. Our
tyi'l leatj us pot to a(k too much ; our
fiimnefs not to relax from what is right ;afid
Qur preparations to enforce our demands.
The general is no dpybt cpnne&ed
with the preservation of peace ; nothing there
fore, fhduld be which may coWdice
to Hw end ; nor any thing attempted which
might rashly disturb it ; but a$ fubftanti-al pre
parations to repel hoftiliiies and obtain juflice,
have always becrf found one of tho rpoft eitefiu
al means which a nation can employ tb
war, it becomes therefore the general intertft,
that provisional military preparations ftiould be
entered into with a spirit and Vigour propor

For the Gazette of the United $tjtss-
Mr. Fenno,
As the reasoning in the House of Repre
sentatives against. Mr. Clark's motion
for prohibiting British commerce has
not appeared in the public papers, you
_ are requested to give a place in your
paper to the following, which con
( tains the fubflance of Mr. Dexter's
arguments against it:
Mr. Dexter introduced his observations
by remarking that he had never risen with
' so great reluctance on any former occasi
on. At so late an hour when patience
seemed exhausted, when reasoning had
given place to inventive, when to oppose
â¢ the relolution was but soliciting reproach
es, when the friends of it, confident of a
majority, were from all fides of the House
impatiently calling for the question, when
the mover of it heard arguments against it
only that he might treat them with con-
tempt, and their authors with insult, he
said it was in vain to a(k for an attentive
hearing. He should not have risen but
for a remark jufl fallen from a gentleman
from New-Jersey (Mr. Dayton) which had
forbidden him to be silent. That gentle
man, said Mr. Dexter, has told us that
the present measure is a flepping-ftone to
fequeflration of British debts. Viewing
it therefore as the beginning of a fyflem
of holtility, which is to be so conducted
as to facrifice not only our interefl and
peace, but our national honor, the duty
to refill it becomes indispensable. Whate
ver may be thought of making laws to an
nihilate the ties of honor and personal con
fidence, and to diflolve the moral obliga
tion of contrasts Whatever may be
thought of the modern usage of nations,
which probably fromgeneralconfenthasbe
come a law, which cannot now be violat
ed without perfidyâwhatever may be
thought of the odium it irfight bring on
our national character, and the complete
definition to our credit at a moment
when we shall probably need the utmost
extent of it; we have not taken those pre
vious fleps for pacific
which the cuflom of nations and all wri
ters of authority hold to be firfl in order
and indispensable. We have not made
that demand for a recompence, which
onght to precede eveiy species of reprisal.
âAfter the observations fir, which I made
in the beginning of the debate, it will not
-be thought strange that I fuffer on the
present occasion an unusual conflict of rea-
foning and of feeling. 1 then stated with
the franknefs which 1 felt, and with the
zeal which the hazardous crilis of our
country infpircd, the reasons and pafiions
which kept my mind in a state of vibra
tion. Struggling with indignation at the
injustice and folly of Britain, I said we
have fuffered until confidence is follyâun
til patience is a crime. Believing that
â  the resolution invoked a principle, which
might be ufeful both for obtaining jullice
and preserving peace; but that the pre
sent shape rendered it not only useless but
injurious ; believing too that it is impro
per for this branch of our government to
begin a negociation with a foreign nation
and preremptorily di&ate the terms of it, 1
, proposed an amendment, which left the
principle in all its force, and avoided some
of the obje&ions. We have heretofore
heard much of a spirit of accommodation;
but the friends of this resolution have not
discovered it. After wearying themselves
in hunting for a reason againlt the amend
mant, it was negatived without any. They
will agree with ua, but it must be precise
ly on their own terms. This is the lan
guage of accommodationâhear and be
lieve whatever we teachâ(loop down and
bear whatever we impose. Vi&ory is in
our own powerâa triumph is better than
pease. If fir, it be connected with dif
' cord and public calamity, the laurel is too
withered to excitc my envy.âlf amid the
fire which rages, we have not forgotten
the cause which produced it, we must re
member that the condemnations of our
veflels in the Weft-Indies in consequence
of the orders of the Britiih government of
the sixth of November, are the great and
immediate cause of complaint. Have we
fir demanded a recompence for this injury,
and, waited a reasonable time for an an
swer? So far is this from fa&, that we
have not taken one Hep towards this, nor
have we even heard from Britain since it
was known there that any condemnations
Fiave taken place. ' ->6 ? u r
Our last dispatches si om our miniftcr at
London tell-to,' tWt de
cided that he presumed no condemnations
would take jf>!ace ig consequence of those
ordersâThe words themielves certainly
do not juftify any.
Have we any right to fay that a de
mand of recompcnce would be fruitlefs,
when the injuries we complain of, are thiis
exprefly dilavowed by the minister ? Did
we know that a demand would be fruitlefs,
Hill we ought to make it in conformity
to the usage of nations, from a decent re
fpeft to their-opinion, and to convince
them in cafe of a war that our enemies
are altogether the aggressors, and that we
have been just and circumipeft. We ,are
judging in our own cauie, and we ought
not to trust ourselves to deviate frotji es
tablished principles, left prejudice should
mislead us. Bnt it is said, that we have
negociated in vain, refpetting the breach
es of the treaty of peace, and that the
delays here, are fufficient to juftify imme
diate war. Do we not know fir, that
there are two fides to that negociation ?
Have not they made demands on us for
breaches of the fame treaty ? The nego
ciation is (till pending in the ordinary
train. We have never given them our
ultimatum on the fubjedts of it. It is
now under the diredlion o'f the Execu
tive, which is the constitutional authori
ty. It is not proper for us to assume to
put an end to it by an ast of legislation.
Who, fir, that calls himfelf an Ameri
can, would dare to pursue a measure
which may tarnilh our national honor ?
If any one would take even a doubtful
step, " Shame ought to burn his cheek
"to cinder." To prevent, being misun
derstood or mifreprefeiited, perhaps I
ought to fay here, that I by no means
deny our right to regulate or prohibit A
merican commerce. I only mean that if
the present controversy should end in wai",
we cannot juftify engaging in it without
firft demanding justice, and if we make
this demand with circumltances which
forbid success, we do not comply with
the spirit of this role, but evade it. Ta
king the measure now proposed, would
forbid Britain to treat with us on the fub
jedt. We know that We should refufe in
similar circumstances. Are we more
proud than Britain ? Did any nation ever
begin negociation with threats ? The ex
ternal forms of regard on such occasions
are so excessive, that nothing but custom
prevents this appearing ridiculous. Hu
manity as well as usage requires .that every
peaceful method should be tried, and that
too in the form best calculated tobe fuc
cefsful. Faithfulnefs to our conftitu&nts,
requires this. Their interest and their
wishes are against courting war. But fir,
we are told that negociation is pusillani
mous. Passion is called American feel
ing. We hear much about energy, and
some seem to think that the occasion calls
for infuit. Sir, noise and declamation,
are very diftindt from fortitude and pa
triotism. 1 The bravest men do not bluster
and threaten. Why should it be thought
too tame a measure to state the injury, and
with manly firmnefs demand a teco/n
---pence ? The pride, the petulance of
Kings, has ways submitted to this, bjit
L â  ; ' 'of a Republic forbids it.
More proud than Kingsâmore insolent
yrants -we despise this law of hu
-1 a " ct ipadt of mankind
here it the i ipot, the ermincd mon
ft r, who dare, to spread desolation and
, havoc, without d- landing firft his right ?
And where fir, is the difference between
not demanding at all, and demanding
such a way as to insure a refufal K - !
How much inllice there- is in the charge
of pul imity, .trhich )as been so often
and liberally us. ; I will not undertake
to determine lieri,:-ips he who purfties
with decent firmne ~ the ii p S) which pro,'
pnety, humanity atidgem lconfeiuhave
provided, and whil.'.he feels the strongest
indignation, is too psotid to throw dirt or

war, arid opposes eve su re to Dre
pareTor it. Left tW difficulties of tbo
present crisis, and the attach on the pt 11c
of Britain, by prefacing our c-'irmand witH
a threat, should not be fufficient to pre!
vent a I'ecompence & provoke tc war o!<:
causes of conttoverfy arc addul. The
breaches of the treaty of peace* by de
taining the posts and negroes, art bid fub
jedts of complaint.' *
Why they are bronght for war... now,
made an indifpenfitle preliminajy ol
aty, when Britain is aided by a pow
ful confederacy, and the world is like
rider, is difficult to conceive, unlcfs we
vifh to kindle here the flame of war.â
Further fir, this throws luch an unequal
burthen on our Merchants* as amounts to
sppreffion. They have already fuffered
extremely from British and other depreda
tions. They beai the principal burthens
in raifmg our Revenue. Is it right to
add to all this, and forbid many of them
to exercise that business, by which they
get their bread, until Britain (hall not on
ly make compensation for their recent in
i uries ; but also fettle all the old matters
of difference precisely on our own terms ?
We are connecting matters which our in
terest requires (hould be separate. Bri
tain, following our own example here,
will fay that by the treaty, all Britifti
debts were to be paid ; but the State laws
and the Courts of Virginia have prevent
ed this. They will offej- to set off these
again ft the injuries fuffered by our mer
chants, and perhaps the ballance will be
against us. Will this be prote&ion to the
ludefers p Yet if we conned these claims
together we cannot obje& to their doing
the fame. It is throwing on the mer
chants all the political evils and burthens
of America. Yet we who oppose this
measure, have been charged with wanting
feeling for their fuffering. Provoking an
unnecessary war will facrifice all their pro
perty now abroad, and deprive them of
all hope of reeompence, for that which
has been already condemned. Going to
war is surely no way to induce Britain to
make compensation ; and it is as certain,
that this Country will be under no obliga
tion to do so, if war (hall be the issue.
This Country is bound to indemnify them
only when we refufe to obtain fntisfaction
from Britain, or to avenge their wrongs.
What inconvenience Pnould we experience
from the delay occalioned by the usual
forms of seeking redress ? Can Britain
run away, like a private malefactor, so
that we cannot catch her to punifli her ?
We (hould at least, be better prepared for
war. If the reasons for it are strong,
they will not fuffer by our taking time to
examine them. Are we afraid that pafii
on will cool, which we hear avowed as the
principle which governs, and ought to
govern our counsels ? Or are we appre
hensive that passion on this occasion is po
pular ? I fufpeft this last idea, has no
small influence. We ought to judge that
nothing will be popular which ,is not right.
I have more refpecl for my constituents
than to believe thaj they will run mad, and
then become so myfelf to please them.
That 1 (hould continue in this feat, is of
very small importance to me, and of none
to the public ; But it is of infinite mo
ment to preserve our peace and national
honor. The path of redfitude is the way
to honor. The man who walks in it with
out deviating, will generally meet the
public approbation. But if h* (hould
fail in this, his own fellings will reward
, him.

On the other hand, those who deal in

UNITED STATES.
NEW-YORK, April 29.
By recent intelligence from Canada, we
can aflure the public, that they in that quar
ter are not making the leafl preparation for
war.
The following Copy of a Protest entered
on the Minutes of the Council of Appoint
ment, has bsen communicated for p'ablica
tion, by
A Correspondent.
DiSCOVERING soon after the appoint
ment of the present council, that a majority
of its members entertained ideas of their â 
powers repugnant in my opinion to the con
llitution, I took an early opportunity of ex
plaining to them my conitru&ion of their
constitutional powers, as fanftioned by the
uniform practice of the preceding councils.
They notwithftar.ding proceeded to en-'
crease the number of Civil Magistrates
in several Counties, and without a hear
ing or any adequate cause assigned, to dif
p.ace many officers. After cxpreffing my
disapprobation to them of such proceedings,
I was at firft content that it Ihould only be in
forced by others from my omitting to fub
knbe the minutes in every cafe in which I
deemed the a&s of the council exceptionable
but as I coÂ»ceive it my duty to bear testimo

afceruineri b l ' hC Â° f ofÃcers is
aicerUined by law, the power of determin-
ing what number is neeeflary, was intended
by the constitution to be lodged in him. For
it this conftruition is not admitted,the coun
cil has it in its power to weaken and perhaps
prevent the interposition of the executive in
enforcing the laws, either in a direfl way by
refufing to appoint such officers as are requi
site for their effectual execution, or in an in
dued! manner by appointing more than is
neeeflary, and thus degrading the reVpeitabi
ty, and diminilhing the energy of the maeif
tracy. The constitution declares that all of
fices, the duration of which is not particu
larly afcertaincd, ihall be held during the
pleasure of the council. By the pleasure of
the ConncH is intended in my opinion not a
capricious, arbitrary pleasure, but a found
rational difcretioft to be exercised for the pro
motion of the public good ; a contrary doc
trine renders the constitution unfafe, and its
admimftration unliable, arid whenever par
tie? exist, may tend to deprive men of their
office, because they have too much indepen
dence of spirit, to support measures which
they suppose injurious to the community and
may induce others from an undue attachment
to office, to facrifice their integrity to impro
per confederations.

PHILADELPHIA,
MAY I.
Extra&of aLetterfrom Cowes,(England)
dated 18th February, 1794. I' ma y
be depended on as authentic.
" 1 have now to inform you that Govern
ment has iflued an order to their collectors
of the cultoms, to stop all Ihips having on
board pot or pearl allies, and to prevent
their departure till further orders ; in con
sequence of this the Iris, from Boston, ar
rived here on Sunday, is ftopt for the pres
ent, as her cargo consists in part of the a
bove articles."
In the debates in the Britilh Parlia
ment, the conduct of the government of
the United States has been brought for
ward with diftinguiftied marks of approba
tion, as well by members of the adminis
tration as by those in the opposition : The
following pafiage, occurs in a speech made
by the Marquifs of Lanfdowne in the
House of Lords against the war:
" The conduit of the Republic of A
merica was worthy the emulation of every
other power. The Americans could not
brook the insult offered by England, and
while the spirit of the people was willing
to meet the misfoi tunes of war, the wii
dom of that great, that good and wife
man, his Majesty ( I mean General Wash
ington) called them back, and they una
nimously agreed to accede to his recom
mendation to preserve their neutrality. If
it were argued that they were in want of
money, he would alk what was the fitua-
tion of Holland? Its credit was so low,
that it could not borrow money at five per
cent, and her debt had accumulated so
much, that (he could not borrow money
in future, at the most exorbitant interest.
The king of Prussia was in a worse state,
and the Emperor was reduced to the expe
dient of encouraging private donations,
which did not promise by any means to
replenish his coffers. The noble marquis
intreated his majafty's miniiters to beware
how they incurred a war with America :
there were various reasons why the mea
sure should be most cautiously avoided ;
and at the present it was well known to â 
miniiters, that Jamaica was obliged to
open her ports, to receive heavy timber,
and other important articles from Ameri
ca. There was a tima when the Weft-
India islands were valuable to this country,
but that period, in a great measure, had
pasTed away. The French had given free
dom to the blacks, and the spirit of liber
ty was not only diffufing itfelf in St. Do
mingo, but throughout all the Weft-ludia
islands. The Weft-Indies will become so
many money traps ; and though the mo
nopoly may be advantageous to them, it
cannot longer be an advantage to this coun
try. If ministers were of a different opi
nion, why not conciliate America, as the
belt and most \ifeful ally in that quarter."
Lord Grenville in his speech in support
of the warâhas the following remarks :
" As to America, which the noble lord
had said was disposed to go to war with
us, his lordship said that he had reason to
be ot a different opinion; on the contrary,
he was persuaded, that if she departed
from her neutrality, it would be on the
fide of her allies.
" He declared that he wished well to
Americaâwas desirous that the utmost
harmony ftould subsist between the two
. â¢ â  t â  , â ' Â» ,
countries, and earnestly wiflied to obliter
ate an 3 wipe away, by every act of good
will and friendly intercoufe, that animosi
ty, which the unhappy contest with this
country had last upon the minds of the
people."
His Lordship here said, that there was
one thing which had fallen from the noble
Lord, refpeaing America, which afto
ni(hed him beyond measure, and gave
him the utmost concern, namely, that it
had been the policy of the British gov
ernment to excite the savages of Ameri
ca to commit h'oftilities against the Ame
ricans. This was a charge of so detesta
ble a nature, and so unwarrantable an as
sertion, that he thought it his duty to
declare it was a gross falfehood : so far
from ftiniulating them to war with the
Americans, the Britifti officers and the
governors of Upper and Lower Canada
had interfered and negociated, and done
the utmolt they could to fettle their dif
ferences, and to bring about a lasting
peace between them.

Charlotte, a tale of Truth,
IN TWO VOLUM ES.
By Mr*. ROWSON, of the New Theatre,
Philadelphia, Author of Viisloria, the In
quisitor, the Fille de Chambre, &c.
Of Charlotte, the Reviewers have given
the following character.
IT may be a Tale of Truth, for it is not
unnatural, and it is a tale of teal diltrefs.â
Charlotte, by the artifice of a teacher, recom
>nendÂ»d to a fchoo'i from humanity rather
tban a conviction of her integrity, or the re
gularity of her former . conduct, is enticed
â¢f torn'her governed, and accompanies a young
nfficer to America. âThe marriage ceremo
ny, if not forgotten, is postponed, and Char
lotte dies a martyr to the inconstancy of her
over, and n'enchery of his friend âThe fitu
ationi are artless and affectingâ'the defcTip
t tons natural and pathetic ; Â»t Ihould feel
foi- Charlotte if such a' person ever existed,
wbo for one er or fcarccly, perhaps, diferved
so severe a punilhment. If it is a fiftlon,
poetic justice is not, we think, properly dii
tributed

The Public are cautioned to
beware of counterfeited Five Dollar Bills of
the Bank of the United States, aid Twenty
Dollar Bills of the Bank of North America,
'fewcrul ef w 'ich have appeared in circulation
within a few days fufi i they are a good ge
neral imitation of the genuine Bills, but way
be dijlifigujhed by the following
marks:
n<ve Dollar Bill of the Bank of the
United States.
ALL that have appeared have the ietter FÂ«
for their Alphabetical Mark.
The Texture- of the Paper is thicker and
whiter and if 'nkes the ink more freely than
the genuine pap^r.
The O. in the word Company is fmalier
than the M. and other Utters ot that word,
so that a line extended fntm the top of ihe O,
to touch the top of the M. would extend con
fideTtbly above the range of the whole word.
In the wold Unired the letters are narrow
erand cloler together than the reft of the bill
The i and fin the word pi omiTe ate not
parallel, tlte yinclining much mote torwarJ
than the i.
The eugraving is badly executed.the strokes
of all the Letters are stronger and the device
in themargii. particularly is much coarf, r and
appears, darker than in the tiue bills. Some
ot the counterfeits bear date in 1791âWhere
as the Eank was not in operation till Decern
ber, and no five dollar bills were iflued in
ihat year.
Twenty Dollar Bills of the Bank ps North
America.
ALL that have appeared letter
B. for tlieir alphabetical mark.
They are printed on a paper nearly similar
to thi.t of the couuterfeit Dollar Notes
above difcubed ; the engraving is better exe
octed, aiid they appro, ch nearer to the ap
pearance of the genuine bills.
The fine ruled lines tlrroogh ihe word Twen
ty, in the body of the bill, are in number th rÂ»
teen in the genuine bills, and but twelve in
the counterfeit?.
The \vo\d Company is much like the fame
word in the Five Dollar B Us Â«s defer ibed a
bnve, the o being less ihan tlie w, and others
following.
There is no stroke to the t ir he word North
whereas in the-genuine bi11.9 the stroke is well
defined
The letter* cnf in the word Twenty, to the
left hand at the bottom, do not come dawn to
the line, but are so ttrf a$ to give an irregular
appearance Jo the word, the ft* and go
ing below them.
The signature ] Nixon, has the appear
ance of being written with lamb-black and
oil, and differs trom other inks used in
printing the bills and the calhier's signature.
It is fuppoled these forgeries were committed
in forne of the Southern States, as all the coun
terfeits thai have appeared, have come from
thence, and two perfous have been apprehend
ed in Virginia, on fufpicton of being the author
of them.
The reward of ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS
| will be paid to any Person or Persons who ftiail
discover and prosecute to cpnviÂ£fcion the fevetal
offenders of the following defcriptioOS or any
of them, viz.
The person or persons, who manufactured
the paper on which the Bills are printed.
The person or persons, who engraved the
plates.
T-l
The printer or printers, of the bills.
Every p'erfon who has acted as a principal in
any other w*v, in the counterfeiting aftd utter
ing the (aid bills.
Philadelphia, March 2.8, 1794
Other counterfeit bills
of the Bank of the United States have appeared
in circulation.
The denomination is of TWENTY DOL
LARS,and the alphabetical mark is the let
ter B.
They may be diftinguilhed from, the genu
ine by the following MARKS :
The paper of rhe counterfeits is of a more j
tender texture and glofley furface than the I
genuine,, and there is no water mark in them.
Tfae letter G. in the word Caihier, in the
true bills is strongly whereas in the
counterfeits, the whole letter is a fine "hair
(fcroke, evidently in an uhfinifhed slate. Thfe
letter a in the word demand, is badly formed
and tlÂ»e whole word ill done, and there is no
â omnia at the end of it, as there is in the
genuine bills.
The marginal device, is much darker in
he faJfe, than in the genuine bills owing to
the (hade strokes being coarser, much nearer
logether, and consequently. much more nu
merous. This difference strikes the eye at firft
*ew.
The fame reward of ONE THOUSAND
iDOLLARS, will be paid for apprebendinj?, &
orofeeuting to conviction the several above
lefcribed Offenders in refpeft to this, as to
he last described bills.

The First American Edition.
THE grand principle of Equality, il right
ly understood, is the only basis on which
universal ju'ftice, sacred order, Mid perfect
freedom, can be firmly built, and permanent
!y lecured. The view of it exhibited in tins
eiT#y, at the fame time that it reprelles the
iniolence of office, the tyranny of pi ide, and
tile outrages of oppression ; confirms, in the
most forcible manner, the necefiitv of subor

thority. So far indeed, from loofenn.g the
bands of society, that it maintains inviolate,
every natural and every civil diftir^iÂ° n ,
draws more clofeiy every social tie, unites in
one harmonious and ju(Hy proportioned tyt
