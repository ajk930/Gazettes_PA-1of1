' O Germinal, March 30.
Barrere announced, that the commit
tee' of public fafcty was engaged in the
purification of the conllitu.ted authorities.
C'.ti/en Gaftcau> lie next stated, had jult
received the appointment of National
A SÂ«it of Paris, in the Head of Lullicr,
who had been put under arrest., In the
mi/n icipality, Chaumette, 11 chert, and
Real, iind been succeeded hy Citizens
Piiyv.n, Moinne, and Lubin. The com
mittee bad appie'ncnded four members of
tihe Girondists ; and had depiived levcjal
otheisof the;r functions, replacing them
by metubcrs of the commune, diftingtiifh
ed by their attachment to the Nation:!
Ivepreitiitau'on. Barrere concluded by
pblerviiiT ihat the committee of thefedH-
O'l of Marat, de:.011 need by the public
voice, had been in the fame way terrene*
rated. ; "
Barrjr? next considered the actual ftatc
of Paris ; and obf-ived 11tat it never con
tained so many niifcreants and traitors a:
at present. Ail the villains of Europe
k-erned to have m-.ide it the it rendezvous ;
but they were every where watched, and
never did the inhabitants of that city, the
mother and guardian of Liberty, (hew
themfclves more devoted to the National
Reprefentalion, and more inimical to trai
tors. Soon would it be impossible for
any enemy of Liberty ta iem:Â«n there
with impunity ; and the very r:ir of Paris
would be fatally infectious to all the fup
poiters of tyrants. Ihe Revolutionary
I Ã¼bunal continued to 11â  on the accompli
ces of the confederacy, aud would, in a
few days, fend several of the criminals to
the fcaffold.
This conspiracy, re fumed B?.rrere,
was connedled with religious difturbatlces;
to excite which an effort was made to
destroy every moral principle, and to in
culcate atheistical dottrines, through the
extravagant enterprizes of .Clootz, Chau
ractteÂ» Hebert, &c. asfainft tile liberty of
worlhip. lli,. committee is employed in
an extensive plan of regeneration, the re
sult of-which willbe at once tobanilh im
morality and prejudices, fuperftttion and
atheism ; and to found the Republic on
good principles and morals.
This report of Barrere was followed by
a decree, approving of the measures of
the Committee.
The Minister of Maiine, announced a
great number of prizes, three of which
were Engliih (hips laden with wine, Bcc.
Si had been carried into Brest on the 34th.
Three others had on the fame dav been
carried into Rochefort, and were bound
from Englftnd to Bilbo a, with cargoes of
oil, meal, lalt-fifh, rice, sugar, cocoa,
&c " 4 kound to Rome, had been
carried into Villa I'"ranca in the country oÂ£

â¢ v: - kiioctl<4wTor the Galstti of the United St at fa.
t am surprised Mr. Fenno, that a pa- j
per, intended as you profefs yew's to be, |
for the information of the citizens of the
United States, should have been so
long deficient in defining terms Ynadc use
of in ail the papers in the country,
to which we have no meaning annex
ed that we can depend on.âThe terms
Democrat and Democracyâ-Aiiilocrat
aod Aristocracy for inltance, have been
Jianded about with odium annexed to each
by different parties,who have endeavored
to o-ain the ears and credit of the citizens;
vou hate Certainly been deficient in your
duty as a public advertiser, in not infotm
in;i your c.ilio'mers wherein consists the
diffe'. once of these hard words ; and left
you (hould continue thus negligent I fend
you what I can collect from my small read
ing on the fubjeft.
Democracy, is derived from ttao Greek
words, Demos, fignifying the people at
large â¢ and Crateia, fignifying Govern
merit ; hence Demotrateia, or as we write
it, democracy, fignifies a government ex
ercised by the whole people.âAristocracy
in like manner, is derived from two Greek
words, Ariitos, fignifying the bejl; and
Crateia, .Government as above ; hence Ari
stocracy is a government exercised by the
b.jl men among the people. This was the
cafe among the ancients ; when in the
middle ages, the rich and the nobles, by
thsir wealth and power, acqmred an influ
ence over the operations of government,
a {Turned the names of the bejl, and ekercifed
feudal tyranny. Aristocrats were odious
to the commonality, and the nobles be
came objects of teiror and deflation :
from their excess in the abuse of power,
arose democracy. When the number of the
whole community was so moderate as to
admit of their meeting together and tak
ing the affairs of their nation into their
consideration, there was certainly the bell
form of government ; but the happiness
resulting front thus combining the wisdom
of a whole community soon encreafed it
by natural population or the accession of
foreigners, so much as to render the meet
ing of the whole periple expensive, t'ouble
fofflt, and in some instances dangerous.
Hence naturally arose the idea of a Re
presentative Republic, which is in fact a
Democracy, because the whole people elect
their representatives to express their will
in the different departments of govern
ment ; but it ought always to be an Ari-
Jiocracy, where the will of the people is
well exeicifcd ; because they ought to cleft
their be/I men to serve them in the highest
offices of stateâand we trust this has been
the cafe in the United States:âFor, we
fee a Washington thus ele&ed unani
mously by the whole people, at the head
of the Executive â , âan Adams his fccond,
and at the head of the Senate ; Senators
and Mcmbersofthe Representative branch,
among whom it would be improper to
make diilinttions, because we suppose that
the will of the whole people conltitutional
ly exercised, has feledted the lejl men with
in their knowledge, in whom tj vest the
high and sovereign powers of the United
Statesâlf this be the cafe, and certainly
it ought to be such, we have no light to
deny that the United States are governed
by an Arijlocracy, that is by the bejl men,
fele&ed in the different election diitrifts,
by tie governed, and representing their will
in all things which shall come before
the executive and legislative departments ;
Under this idea, well underjlood, our rulers
ought not -to be terrified with the popular
clamor of Arijlocrats and Aristocracy ; for
if ever a people were under such a govern
ment, the United States certainly claim
the pre-eminence of a Real Ari/locretcy ;
that is, a government by the bcjl men among
them, fe pa rated from the people only be
cause of their better ftnifs to fulfill the du
ties imposed on them by their appoint
ments.
But what (hall we fay of the people,
who Ailing themselves Democrats are at
tempting to leap into the saddle, and of
their own choice to ifurp the powers not
delegated to them by the whole people ?
Mr. Fenno, I donotchufeto answer this
quefUun at present, I (hall reserve some of
my sentiments on this fnbjeft to a future
paper, but I will just hint, that I think
them the true and odious Arijlocrats, from
thefo!low:ng chaia&eriftic marks:
lft. They chose themfdves in the be
ginning', and did not originate from the
peop'e at largt, as all legal governments
ought to do.
2d. They will rot fuffer the people, or
any part of them to fend representatives
amongll them ; one of their fundamental
rules being, that a great majority of their
gjodfeives ftiali be ntCefl'ary to the induaion
of every member. -â¢
Having never corafponded with you
before, I am yet to leain what reception
you will give to my fir it attempt ; I (hell
hereafter judge of the propriety of fending
you some further observations on political
fubjefis. A CITIZEN.

FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE.
BRUSSELS, April 13.
Our generals, as well as thole of the
enemy, appear to have waited the presence
of the Emperor, to begin their operati
ons.
The French, under the command of
general Pichegru, continue to form a vast
camp near Cambray. All their forces are
colle&ed in that point with the utmofl ac
tivity, and they have taken the greater
part of the garrisons, excepting only those
which are mod strongly threatened by the
allies, lle-inforcements are hourly arriv
ing at Cambray, from every part of France,
amongst the latter, has been a body of
cavalry, to the amount of zoo men, con
fiding of a regiment of carabineers, of the
hussars of Chamborant, and a corps of
chasseurs.
As to the grand combined army, Under
the prince of Cobourg, it is (till concen
tered beyond Valenciennes and Quefnoy.
The greater part of the forces in the pio
vince of Tournay arc marching with the
utmost diligence to that quarter ; these
circumstances cause it to be believed that
a general and decisive action may daily be
expected.
On the 6th inft. a large body of the
Conventional troops, advanced from Lisle,
to reconnoitre our politions between the
town and Tournay. They "advanced to
Baifienna, within two leagues of the lat
ter place, and a conflict in which
the dragoons of Latuiir greatly ditlin
guifhed themselves. The French, how
ever, accomplished their objedf, and re
tired in good order.
April 15.
His majefly the empetor and king quit
ted this city, yesterday morning to repair
to the army. During his Ihort stay heie
he gave the people the molt affe&ing proofs
of his love, receiving the petitions of the
lowed of his fubjefts, and walked atjlongft
them in the Park and other places, unat
tended by any guards. â¢ His majesty paid
frequent visits to the hospitals, especially
the military ones, to fee that the soldiers
were properly attended to, and visiting
every bed, consoling the invalid warriors
for their refpeftive misfortuns. In fine,
he conduced himfelf in such a manner as
to gain universal love, and his departure
has occasioned the deepest reget.
MANHEIM, April 8.
We learn that the lines drawn by tTie
French at Germerftieim are entirely finish
ed, together with the entrenchment? which
they are raising on the heights frora New
ftadt to Weiffembourg. At Spire they
have destroyed all the buildings belonging
to the clergy, and mean to destroy the ca
thedral, the top of which has already been
'pulled down.
VIENNA, April 2.
A kind of Jacobin Club having been
held in this city, the members of it have
been tried and are now undergoing their
punillimeur. These reformers have been
for the mo ft part sentenced to a public
whipping, and a year's imptifonment, at
the end of which time they are to be ba
nished. Some priells arc iufpe&ed of be
ing concerned with the Club.
VALENCIENNES, April 14. .
" This day arrived here his imperial
majesty the emperor, and was received
with the most unequivocal demonftratioris
of loyalty and love. The whole town is
to be illuminated to night, and resounds
every where with the loudest acclamations
of " long live Francis 11. our dearly be
loved Sovereign." To-morrow if the
weather permits, the emperor is to review
that part of the ai-my which is already en
camped ; and next Thursday or Friday
wr opeiations will begin. * ,
"The Carmagnols are encamped be
tween Landrecy and Guise, between 80
and lco,ooo inen strong. As our grand
army is fupericr to theiPs not only in overy
military accompllflitnent, but aifo (which
has never yet been the cafe) in numbers ;
we wt'Srtain the mod confident hopes, tnat
unleft the Republicans should think pro
per to avoid a battle, one of the compleat
eft victories rruilt crown the attack, which
in all probability before the end of this
week will be made againlt them."
PARIS, April 13.
Letters from Strasbourg, read in the
Jacobin Club, speak of an advantage ob
tained over the enemy in the territory of
Deux Ponts, by which the Republic had
acquired cattle, warlike fiores, and 800
gold medals with the effigy of Capet. â
The vigorous measures of Gen. Dieche,
m;de the Aristocrats and Batiditti on the
other fide the Rhine tremble. There
was every profpeft of a fruitful hal
ve ft.
LONDON, April 14 â19.
The Lords having adjourned on the
last day the Slave trade bill was to have
come on, without making any order re
fpe&ing that business, it of course drops
unless some Pcci iTiall formally move its
revival.
The accounts brought by yesterday's
mails aie not deciiive refpedling the ope
rations of the PrufTian troops, but only
confirm their having received orders from
Berlin to halt until further notice*
There is not the leait appearance of
any negociation 011 the itapis sot a peace
at preftnt.
Since the Polish General Ivofciusco's
entranceinto Cracaw, he has taken an in
ventory of the gold and lilver in the
churches and royal castles; his revolu
tionary ,tribunal consists of 14 membeis;
since then the Confiitution of the ift
ps May, 1791, has been solemnly ac-<
knowledged by oath in the church of Ma
rienborn 1 tjx* proctflion went there at
tended by military music.
The Universal, publiilied from this
quarter enjoins the hig'hcit refpedt fcr
the Austrian territory ; and though the
Polish reformers have feize3 some Impe
rial magazines ; they have sent a very ci
vil mefTage to the Auilrian commandants,
a(Turing them of an an ample indemnifi
cation ; they are said to be furnilhed with
money from France.
The revolutionary spirit has spread in-,
to several other parts of the Republic ;
where many of the disbanded regiments
have risen in arm:'. The Caitcllan Rimie
fwyfky, was tried by the Revolutionary
Tribunal at Cracaw, and hanged in the
market-place on the fame day.
Bodies of Ruffians and Prussians, to
the amount of 25,000, men being on
their maichto Cracaw, where the malcon
tents have not above 6 or 7000 men bad
ly provided with artillery, their difperiion
was daily expected. Several notes have
passed between the Permanent Council,
and the Ptuffiau Minister, 011 the subject
of difturbanccs, and a Court is opened to
try offenders as fall as they are appre
hended.
There is a gentleman in town who was
formerly Secretary to General Washing
ton, and left Pans no longer ago than the
I ith inft. He wag witness to the execu
tion of Danton, slnd the other confpira
torsj and iayf, th?re was nq kind of tu
mult during the ceremony. Paris is now
tolerably well supplied with provisions ;
and it appears, that the fleet of veflels
which lately caused an alarm for the fafe
ty of. Jersey was only a very large fleet
of coaltiog veflels, carrying provisions for

Barrere. Since the last victories of the
Republic ovej the tyrants,-we have felt
the importance of the conqutft-of Oiteig
lia, a port in tTie Mediterranean, from
â whence the tyrant of Â§ardinia interrupted
our trade and infuhed ojir navy.
Grtat many obllacles were to be over
come in erdcr to artive at Onciglia. It
was neceffarjrtd pass through.ths territory
of Genoa. they, nppofe4 us with
diplomatic arguments. But thip webb of
lies and cunning has to difapppar before
the eternal rights ofnationc, and before
the imperious wants of liberty. :
The committee have done iheir duty
in pafiing a refutation on the 19th Veil
tofe, with refpedt to the conquest of
Oneiglia, the plan of the marrh of the
aimy of Italy was formed and Ihe execu
tion entrusted to the firmnefs of those re
preftntat:ve3 who had led the troops to
tlie recapture of Toulon.
Previous to their march thÂ«y iiTued a
proclamation worthy of the Ficneh pec
ple and of the National Convention, and
gave thereby to our politics the; chara&er
of the maj?;lv of the people, snd of its
impartial und inflexible juftiee.
The following they write us from Oneg
liaon the 10th Germinal (April 8.) The
Republic lives upon victories i you may
announce to her the capture <>!' Oneglia,
the principal communication ot the Saidi
nian tyrant with Sardinia : thi Republi
cans have performed this with that con*
rage and energy which makes all Europe
tremble : The blood of the ff'ldiers of li
berty has been spared : We had not one
killed ; and only a few (lightly wounded.
The aiti'ery had not time to fend their
thunderiipoii the Brigands i f Oneiglia;
but thev have done wondu s of courage
and ability in dragging t heir cannon on
almofft inaccessible mountain}.
Italy (hall inform Europe of the vir
tues as wc. Il 33 of the vjlour < f the armies
of the Republic : We were obliged for a
n â¢ â¢
ihon t time to occupy part of the territory
of Genoa : it belongs to the people who
inhabit it to make known to the vrorld
the fubliine conduit of the L'terch Repub
licans : they will tvil yo-.i, thr.t the dflr
firndersot their country, fatigued, and do
firous of r.iting themfelv 's, did not dare
pâ¦
to spoil the green herbage which invited
them to fit down ; they will.tell you, that
marching under orange trees, and iuffer
ing an extrerfie thivft, the foldierp refpeft
ed even the leaf of this tree ; they will
tell you, that some of them having inad
vertently la;d down on some leaves which
they took to be. useless, offered to pay for
them as soon as they were informed by
the proprietor of their value.
j The Piedmontefe tyrant certainly pas-
Jes. very bad nights, and prepares to emi
grate from his kingdom, which is much
curtailed. We fliall end to vou a (tate
ment of the effects found in Oijeglia. We
found 12 pieces of cannon which the ene
my had not had time to spike. .
The general of division, Mouret, who
commanded the column on the right of
the troops of the Republic in the expedi
tion against Oneglia, writes under the
lame date, that he. had got pofTeflion
thereof on the preceding evening, April 7.
It is thus, added Barrere, that the in
jury done to the French commerce is re
paired :. and that our ports of Nice and
Ville Franche will enjoy greater tranqui
lity ; the subsidized inclofure of the Court
of T Win is at an end,, and the glorious
prospect of a brilliant campaign opens
upon the arms of the Republic.
Besides these fuccefTes on the Med iter,
ranean, other? have beep obtained on the
Ocean. The marine of the Republic con
tinues to keep the commerce of the Eng
h(h, Dutch and Spaniards in a Hate of
arreflatio". The Mijiifter of the marine
has jull now informed us, that the said
three nations have loft 21 vefl'els, fix where
of were burnt, three wrecked 011 our
coaits, one foundered, and eleven have
been brought into our ports.
Levafieur, observed that the army of
Italy had religiously executed the decree
of the Convention, which makes morality
and jnilice the order of the day ; he there
fore moved that it (honld be declared that
it had well deferred of their country.
Robespierre fraonded the motion, per
suaded that the Contention,having order
ed such decimations to be made for the
fake of vi&ories, would be more eager to
make it for the fake of virtue.
PHILADELPHIA,
JUNE 11.
From a Correfpomicnt.
Mr. Monroe's apologist, in yfifterday's
General Advertiler, makes this dittinftion
and the only dittinftion between the cafe
of Mr. j. and that of Mr. M. to conlifl
in this, that the former continues to hold
his office of Chief Justice, whereas the
latter has refigncd his feat as Senator.
But this diflinttion can only apply to
a ptriotl subsequent to their refpcclive ap
pointments, and does not derogate from the
force of the ftriftures on M's inconlilten
ciesj the incompatibility, if any, fubfilt
ed in both cases with equal validity at the
time of appointment. Mr. M. objected to
Mr. j's appointment, as being then Chief
Justice ; Was not Mr. M. Senator when
Be was appointed Minister ?
How does the apologifl labor to ex
tricate his friend from the dilemma to
which he has been reduced ? Why, by the
following curious obfervati'on, " The ob
jection to Mr. J. in the Senate upon the
ground of the confutation was probably made
in the belief or intimation of his friends
that he meant not to resign his judicial
office." Ought a member of such a dig
nified body as the Senate of the United
States, to ast merely on probabilities and
intimations ? Did Mr. J. himfelf declare
previously to his appointment, that he
would not resign his Chief Jullicefhip ?
Could he, before his appointment declare
it ? Would not such a declaration have
been inconfiflent with the manliness of
Lis character Would it not have been
construed into a solicitation for an cmbaf
fy, which it is well known he accepted
with great reluctance, and from a patriotic
fente of duty to his country at a momen
tous and critical junftnre ?
The objection, fays the apologifl, on
the ground of the conftitation arose from
a probability and an intimation. Was it
Mr. M's practice to make conflitutional
objections on such flimfy foundations ?â
Bat the following reasoning is com In live,
and I defy Mr. M. and a holt of apologilts
to get over it.
Either the objedtiftni cn the ground of
the conjl'uul'ion as it is called, applied to
the period when Mr. J. was nominated,
irto a period) subsequent to his appoint
ment.
If to the foimer, then the objection on
the score cf constitutional incompatibility,
was as valid against Mr. M. as Mr. J. If
the obje&.iou applies to the period subse
quent to his appointment and there cxiits
a conjiitutional incompatibility, then Mr. J.
must be deemed no longer Chief Justice,
for his acceptance of the office, of, M
ini fter vacates his ojjice as Chief JuJlice.
Now I leave Mr. M's apologist to make
his ele&ion ; if he applies the confHtu
tional objection to the former, it invali
dates his own appointment; if to the lat
ter, then all the idle, clamor about Mr.
J. is ridiculousâand Mr. M. and his
friends must resort to new grounds of at
tack on his appointment.

VIENNA, March 29.
All thi travellers who come from Tur
key represent that country as gieitly
in want of corn, which will be no small
embarrassment to the carryirig on of a war
with Russia, and it is hoped, n&twith
llanding the preparations making at. Bel
grade and elfewiiere, that a rupture will,
be avoided. Our Court, however, in or
der to be prepared again!!; all events, are
reinforcing the frontier garrisons, "and re
pairing all the fcrtrefles towards Semliii.
1 he fame accounts from Constantinople
add, that the people continually (hew their
discontent in their usual way, by feitinj
fire to the town in different places. On
the 24th of February the large magazine
of corn was nearly in flames, but that ca
lamity was happily prevented. The Ja
nifTaries have daily quarrels with the Alia
tic troops, of whom there are 40,000 in
Constantinople, learning the new tatties ;
in these quarrels there is generally blood
spilt.
