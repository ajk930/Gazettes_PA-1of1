AGRICULTURE.
Mrffrs. Printers,
AS the Crows are frequently veiytrou
bletome, by eati: g the Indian Corn after
it is planted, I wilh yon to publilh the
following very easy method to prevent it .:
-â  Difl'olve three quarters of a pound of
Salt-Petre in water enough to cover half
a bulhel as feed corn ; let it soak three
or four days; stir it carefully once or
twice each day, that all the corn may be
impregnated with it, and the Crows will
not visit the field more than once, and
then will eat but very little of if. It is
also of great service again 11 the Grub-
Worm, lo troublcfome in low ground.
And Meflrs. Pt,inters, let me also tt
commend planting Corn the beginning of
May, and if by a late fioft in the fpn'ng
it is killed, do not replant it, as it, wifl
sprout again, and before the fall tevover
its full growth,-and be as forwatd as if
the froft had not touched it. Many are
so fearful of a froft in the spring, as to
make it so late before they plant, that
the corn is often hurt by the froft in the
fall, which it can never recover.

AN ACCOUNT
, OF A
NEW SPECIES OF WHEAT.
THE history of forward winter wheat,
J.V 1 â¢ TT- â¢ . .
Caroline, of that ilate, about seven years
iaft, purcbafed of a merchant a quantity
' ~ mg fownit, when
his wheat was in flower, observed a finglt
ear, almoit ripe. Hence he conceived an
idea, that it might be a different species.
To determine this, he carefully preserved
the wheat produced by this fulitary ear,
which has now multiplied to such a degree,
as that several thousand bufhtls wiu be
produced at the next harvest, it having
been distributed into many hands.
But the charadtqr of this wheat deserves
greater attention. And as in all proba
bility, it has not yet entirely unfolded its
qualities, it is much to be desired, that
the best informed botanical knowledge,
and the moil accurate agricultural experi
ments, were united in its investigation.
The following observations, have, for
their basis several trials upon different foils,
made in the two lafl years; a term so short,
that it would be dangerous to allow
an unsuspicious reliance.
This wheat ripens from 15 to 20 days
earlier than any other; the It raw is shor
ter by about one third, than that of; any
other kind, and the fame proportion is
maintained in the length of the ear. But
the ear always possesses a foil and perma
nent appearance. The straw is encum
bered with very little fodder.
The circumstance of its ripening so
early, produces the following important
effects.
I ft. It is never deftroytd by the rush
An effect. towards which the nakedness
and lowlefs of the straw, by allowing more
freely the a&ion of the fun and air, must
considerably contribute. Upon this point,
the experiments appeared to be cbnclu
five.
The two last years were Angularly un
seasonable upon wheat in general, after it
was in the ear, where the experiments
were made, and mod so upon this particu
lar species. But this bid defiance to the
pestilence, and weighed above sixty pounds
to the bushel, whilst all others fuffered a
loss of about one third in quantity, an d
did npt in weight exceed an average of
fifty-five. The experiments were made
in fix different places. Upon new, old,
ftiff, light, poor and rich ground. And
the different forts of wheat were sown on
the fame day, immediately contiguous to
each other, early andfcpe.
Io V
t
â¢jp 1â¢â¢ "
2d. Being ripe, before cockle have ar
ttveJ to a vegetative itate, it is never af
failVd by that enemy. And i< is .proba
ble that the feed of the wild onion, may
f<*l ;i (hock from the fame cause. As to
cheat, it did not make its appearance a
liioiig .this Wheats but it is to foe expttt
&!, this like other wheat is liable to dege
riei ate into fhat weed.
3d. If vegetables ext raft much of their
food from the atmosphere, as the experi
ments of Doctor Prieilly foeina dearly to
prove, spul if ' ore of tins fbsd is ob
tained, ",'hen the air is condensed by a
degree 0f moiiture, than when it 19 in a
itate of rarefa&ion, it results, that this
wheat cannot equally impoverish the foil,
with any other species. Because it ar
rives to maturity before the heats of sum
mer have driven down vegetables to pas
ture ihemfelves almost exelufively, upon
the store of food absorbed by the earth. ,
4th. Admitting this theoretick argu
ment to be inconcltifive, it will not weak
en the force of another, which is expe
rimental. Clover was sown upon four of
the fix lots of this wheat, and also upon
its contiguous rival. The clover, and
where there was no clover, the weeds
succeeding this wheat, so far furpafied in
growth, the clover and weeds succeeding
the other kinds, that their fupcrior luxu-
I'iancy was distinguishable almost as far as
they could' be discerned. And though
this effect fho'lild be attributed to the remo
val, of the forward wheat from the ground
earlier than the other, yet it must It ill be
acknowledged, that it will have a preser
vative influence upon the fertility of the
foil.
sth. Wherever the cliniate will admit
ef artificial grades, the last obfevvation
deserves considerable attention : And it
may be enforced by others, having a si
milar tendency. Before, as well as after,
the forward wheat was cut, the growth
of the clover sown upon it greatly ex
ceeded'that of its neighbor, and it also
came up better. Whether this is afcrib
able to thi fownefs. of the wheat, and its
not being burthened by any operative
weight of fodder, or to any other caiife,
it is yet an effect, as recommendatory of
it to northern climates, as its fafetv against
rudktafcirthcni. The flHuft.

er, and it also acquires a strength oi
ftitution, capable of wjttilt anoint
tummer beats. Thtfs it alrm.lt- umver
fally survived, whilst the contiguous clo
ver, debilitated by being opprelfed with
a greater burthen of straw, and to a later
period, peri(hed, generally in great quan
tities, andinfpots, entirely.
6th. If Indian corn is cultivated to a
considerable extent, it usually fuffers at
harvest. The harvest of the forward
wheat is over, when the corn is yet young,
and therefore recoverable ; whereas it of
ten happens, that it sustains irretrievable
injury, by arriving to an advanced state,
during the negieft incident to the latter
~ harvest.
7th. When potatoes or other vegeta
bles, which are gathered late in the fall,
are used as a fallow crop, the repugnancy
of this wheat to the lull, must be highly
recommendatory, because late sowings are
ever most liable to this diflemper.
With refpeft to the straw, which is
inferior in quantity to that of other
wheat, about one third, it occUts to ob
serve,
1 ft. That this circumstance produces a
feving of near one third of the labor of
cutting, gathering up, carting and Hack
ing.
2d. That the wheat being (hart, never
lodges. , >.
3d. That it may be cut by the scythes,
almost unexceptionably.
4th. That the draw is not liable to be
damaged by the rust.
yth. That the grain before and after
the wheat is cut) is not liable to an equal
degree of risque with wheat carrying a
greater burthen of draw, from rain, be
cause this species dries i'ailer, and is got
in sooner. ' i
It may be objeaed, that this circum
stance diminifhesthe great fund for raising
manure. To this it is answered, that the
ft raw is only an offal of the crop. That
no crop can be cultivated for the fake of
the offal. That the impoverishment of
the foil by the growth of straw, is pro
bably equivalent to the quantity produ
ced. That hence it may be inferred, that
it will require the whole surplus of straw,
produced by the latter wheat, to icpair
its surplus of injury to the* foil, beyond
the forward. And that if it was admit
cd, that a given quantity of land, in
the latter, frouM produce more ft raw.
than the lame quantity in the tor ward, it
does tib't follow, that aiimilHf effect would
flow from, a givenquantity o't labor; becauie
the laving of lab--- being equivalent to
â  the deficiency of flraw, may be convert
! Ed to the extention pi tillage, and thus
I more than compenlate for that deficiency,
litlides, if these Sfguownts are jujt,
they exhibit an article of agricultural
economy of great important*/ ihe
whole labor of removing the surplus of
ihawâof converting it info manureâ
and of reilbring it to the loil, is laved,

cause the late,\vheat does not rob the foil
of this surplus. The forward wheat inva

The lhvitnefs oi Uic tat is tni

circumilance seldom, or never happens,
but if it did, it ought net llill to be con

Crop per acre of the forward ifrheat will
be grtateft, whilst it will ftrllimpoverifh

out to be groundless, as to an equal quan

pass, i and yet excluding the coiilidera
tioijs of frfs magnitude, an improvement
of the foil and an evidence' of tlie cxclu
five calamities, to which later wheat
is are among the advantages which
wÂ»uld (till remain.' /
To form a comparative average of these
rival corps, would ri-qufre a long succes
sion of accuiatfe experiments, as the only
means by which a jiitl computation of
the exdufive calamities so inimical to the'
later wheat, can be made. During the
t,wo years' experiments; before mention
td, the forward wheat was preferable to
the latter in every refpeft, and in all foils.'
The crop exceeded by the acre, in piea-'
sure, in weight, and as to the value U
the draw. But these results do n6t fur*
ni(h fufficient evidence of the
ces, in cafe both kinds 'fliould arrive to a
state of protedlion.
The grain of the forward wheat is hard
er than any other with which it has been
compared. It is also large, pluijip, white,
and produces flour in quantity and quality
equal to the bell later white wheat.. ;
This hardness of the grain..cqnipires
with the inferior growth of the draw and
fodder, to leffori the liability of the for
ward wheat, to sprout in the field. An
effect to which its ripening in cooler wea
ther also contributes.
It is very probable that this species of.
wheat would be a beneficial acquisition to
countries, whose fcort summers,
warm climates, or wet feajons, occasion
many impediments in the culture of this
grain. If it was introduced into Great
Britain, and if it should be found that the
toil and climate of America, operated par

country would be greatly benefited, a nf*'

UNITED STATES.
CHARLESTON, April 30.
An affray took yesterday on board
the Apollo Capt. Keown, of Philadelphia.
A Frefich lad, had been on the wharves to
borrow a colour of one of the American lhips.
The Jailors of the Apollo palled some jokes
upon him, and he, not thoroughly under
ftauding them, thought himfelf affronted.
He left the Ihip, and Ihortly after returned
with a number of Frenchmen drefled out
with cockades, and who displayed the flags
of boti the nations. They went on board
for an explanation. To make up the mat
ters they infilled that one of the sailors should
kiss the cockade, which he would not submit
to.
High words and blows enftftd. The
Frenchman most immediately engaged, drew
a dagger. One Welch, received three
wounds in his head. One by the name of
Duncan was stuck by the dagger in the bel-
Iy, tho' the physicians think he may recover
as his mteftines item riot to be injured. The
citizens allembied, seized and conduced
tliem to the gtoq house. Gae or two-i rench
men were wounded with the weapons Nature
..as provided for our defence.
in-the afternoon, tjie French Consul wait
ed upon lhe Captain on board. He being
out, the conlul defiredhe might be acquaint
ed, that he was foiry for the accident; that
he diiavowed their conduct as lubjeets of the
repuolic, and that he ihouid be among the
firlt to prosecute the villains to conviction.
About 5 o'clock, we are informed, another
'at'or was wounded in the face with a ctitlafs,
in Meeting-street, by a company of five
frenchmen.

EMBARGO.
Saturday last, a refolntion was laid or.
the table of the House of Representatives,
by Mr. Smith of South Carolina, for
continuing theembaigo to the 20th June.
This day the lubjeft was taken upâ
an amendment was moved to add,fo far as
refpeSs vejfels bound to the Weji-In diesâ
this motion was loftâand after confideia
ble debate the question being put on the
original resolution, it was negatived, se
venty-three to thirteen.
The New York Journal of Saturday,fays,
Mr. Jay, was to fail from New York, vef
terday.
EictraS from a pamphlet entitled Â« Naked
Truth" publijhed in England immediately
after the lOar of 1755.
""Naked truth isalways disagreeable to
weak, minds- as tbcy corapofe the Bulk of
mankind, Ihe.ja themoliliateful to themnJ-,
titude.
" I knew it is as dangerous to write
against popular prejudices as against tyrants.
" Let us call back a few years, and fee
with what ardor the merchants cried out for
a Spaniih war ; a few lhips were plundered,
a Captain loft his ears, no fatisfa&ion would
go down ; even men of l'enfe supported the
party.
We sent a noble fleet; covered the sea
with our ihips, and the ifiands with our fof
diers ; but what return, \ve burled twenty
thoufani! men wiihout a battle.
" Whence came the disappointment ? frdm
the war's being improper, and drove on by
popular clamor. By believing t,hofe popular
prejudices, or not daring to oppose them, the
government was forced to carry on the war
in unvvholfome climates.
It is hurting a prince, or minister, greatly,
to urge them by popular clamor to a war.
A magnanimous prince, hearing such cla
mors, i 6 unwilling to Hem them, leu his glo
ry Ihould fuffer; and a wife minister muff
give way to the joint cry of the people, and
urge on the courage of the prince, tho"
he knows the danger.
The merchant, manufacturer, shipbuilder,
and infinite numbers employed in fitting out
(hipping, may cry out for war.
" Great is Diana of the Ephefians, said
the (lirine makers : perhaps they Would be
lcfs violent, would they but consider what a
desperate reckoning was paid for their focrt
harvest at the beginning of the late war.
" As the war of 1755 was in greac mea
sure urged 011 by the merchants, so the treaty
of Paris was rendered unpopular by the f?.me
merchants, who did not find that it gave
them as'macy monopolies as they expeilecL"

. The last event at Port-au-Prince has cre
ated confirmation in every heart âIt ihews
how much France is deceived by the usur
pers who destroy the country in its name,
whilst the Engliih and the Spaniards under
the pretext of preservation, or protection
compleat on their part the ruin of this flou
rilhing colonyâ(Of this several betters from
St. Domingo allure us)âln this unfortu
nate city (Port-au-prince) the whites redu
ced to a iiate of weakness and nullity the
moll wretched, waited in silence a change in
their situation, when Sonthonax and Mon
brun, mutually jealous of their refpeiflive au.
thorities, contemplated a decisive liroke to
afiure each to himfelfthe superiority.
Monbrun, sure of the corps of Equality of
which he had attached to himfelf all the
officers, troubled Sonthonax, who under the
pretence that the Englifli threatened Port-au-
Prince, went to the prisons harangued the
prisoners, and offered them their liberty on
condition of their joining the battalion d' Ar
tois, to compleat itâthe prisoners consented,
were armed and polled in one part of the
fortifications, whilst the troops of equality
occupied the other. This augmentation of
force appeared to Monbrun a projedt to de
termine the inferiority of his party âhe im
mediately formed a resolution to oppose it.
On the night of the following day, Monbrun
attacked the works with the corps of Equa,
lity; furpfized the new battalion d'Artois
and massacred a great number âthe alarm
spread to all parts âall the whites found in
Greets were (hot. In this fugfyful con-
Klion all the inhabitants, men, women and
c 'i-ldren. who co aid fa,v<_ ihciiifelvee, fought
n 'ugc, lojneat Jothers' at Archave.

noncd him. to iurrelyier in an hour, or he
â would maflacre all the whites in the city,-
ncii, women ana children to the number of
2io. Sbntt&nax. l'eeing he couM riot refilt,
lu rendered to jtÂ£on&ri<n-~âthe 80 whites he
hsd with him saved themselves by fleeing to
Leogaoe and Archaye. Behold then Sontho
uai in the power of JVlonbrun, who will
hare an eye upop him.
A reported th.t five hundred whites
were murdered on this occafton. That the
negro Hyacinth released from prison by this
event, marched immediately to Cul-Ue-Jac,
and entered the town with 6 or 7 thousand
negroesâhe has poflefied himfelf of the
Forts St. Jofepb and St. Claire? determined
lo refilt Sonthonax and Monbrun.
_ Thus to the continual Ihock of authori
ties, the evil designs ps foreign powers, per-"
petual divilions, the' pretentions -of one par
ty, and the weakness of the other, may be
ascribed the ruin ofrthis milerable colony.
For if all tb ir eftbrts had be turned to its
prelervation, it is not law which they have
_ou!cu, till it is loft would, have deltroyed
them. "Union would have been their iecuritv.
?r(inflated from the Courier Francois of
this morning.
Sy perforis arrived here from Port de
Psix, St. Domingp, we learn that the
Commandant Levaux and Col. Pageot, are
determined to prefervc td the French'Re
ptlbjjic the places which they have in their

Levaux has taken the camp Fouaehe

who were made ptifonersâ He took this
camp witfiout.liring a gun. The English

ExtraS from the New-Tork Journal of
Saturday lajl.
" After fpehding tlic evening at the card
table, and taking a fpcial glass, I retired
to bed, funk to ileep, and dreamed that
1 was, on a morning, in the gallery of
tile House of lleprefentatives in Con
gt-efs. .jThe Speaker, with either a pen
knife, or a-key, I could not discover
.which, rapped on a table, and instantly
all the gentlemen put off their hats and
rose up. At that instant I saw, at the
Clerk'? table, a man of a grave appear
ance almost covered with a huge white
wig, which had fifteen tails to it, and a
fort of gown and cafTock, in which green,
blue, white, red, and black, were mix
ed in a manner I cannot cfefcribe. He
opened a huge book, and read as fol
lows : N
From the triumph of palfion over rea
son, Good Lord deliner us.
From national pique, Good Lord, l2c.
From unjust; modes of taxation, and
fooliih modes of spending mofiey, Gooa
Lord, &c.
From long fpeeche*, made for the fake
offpeechifying, Good Lord, l 5(.
From offcnfihle reasons, in(tead of real
motives, Good Lord, I'fc.
From the clashing of the interests ol
merchants, farmers, artificers, fundlingi
and fidlers, Good Lood, &c.
From that European system of polity
which has ruined so many nations, Gooi
Lord,
From that plan of governmental ma
nagement which is caculated to render
the rich richer, and the poor poorer,
Good Lord, &c.
From an "heavy debt and reiterated
loans, Good Lord, &c.
From national pride, and national pro
digality, Good Lord, Â£s'c.
From the folly of encouraging com
merce for the fake of cncreafing the re
venue, Good Lord, (sfc.
From the nonsense of encouraging
consumption for the fake of encreafing
commerce, Good Lord, &c.
From pushing commerce on a flftitious
capita], Good Lord, &c.
Fronj a wish to villify, and from fear
to examine public naeafuxes, Good Lord,
oy.
From a government addrefied to the
fears, rather than to the good sense, and
sensible interests of the people, Good
Lord deliver us. Amen.
He endeed with a groan of despairâ
bowedâwent away, and wept as he went.
Most of the gentlemen seemed displeased;
a few seemed to be in unison with the
good man of the wig, while one, who I
was told was a merchant, fat all the tin:e
eagerly attentive to a letter which he had
juit opened."

BY THE SUBSCRIBER,
The Public are cautioned to
beware if counterfeited Five Dollar Bills of
the Bank of the United- States, and Twenty
Dollar Bills,of the bank cf North America,
fe-veral of which have appeared in circulation
within a few dap pdfl; they are a good ge
neral imitation of the genuine Bills, but may
be diflinguifhed by the following
MARKS.
Five Dollar Bills of the Bank of the
United States,
ALL that have appeared havre the letter F.
for their Alphabetical Mark.
The Texture of the Paper is thicker and
vhiter and it takes the ink more freely thar
lie genuine paper.
- r\ .i â¢
The O. m the word Company is smaller
than the M. and other letters of that word,
so that a line extended from ihe top of ihe O,
to touch the top of the M would extend con
siderably above the range of the \vhole word.
In the word United the letters are narrow
erand closer together than the reft of the bill
The i and yinthe word promile are rot
parallel, the yinclining much mare lorwarJ
than the I.
The engraving is badly executed,the ftiokes
of all the Letters are stronger and the devue
in themargiu particularly is much coarlcr and
appeal's darker than in the true bills. Some
at the counterfeits b< ar date in 1791âWhere
as the Bank was not in operatiom till Decern
ber, and no five dollar bills were ifTued in
j'lat year.
Ttwenty Dollar Bills of the Bank of North
America.
ALL that have appeased have ihe letter
B. tor their alphabetical mark.
They are printed on a paper nearly similar
to that of the counterfeit Five Dollar Notes
above ; the engraving is bettei exe
ucted, and they approach nearer to the ap
pearance of the genuine bills*
The fine ruled lines through the word Twin
ty, in the body of ihe bill, are in number thir
teen in the genuine bills, and but twelve in
ihe counterfeits.
The word Company is much like the fame
word in the Five Dollar Blls as defer ibed a
bove, the o being lets than the m, and others
following.
There is no stroke to the t inihe word North
whereas in the genuine bills the stroke is well
defined.
The letters ent in the word Twenty, to the
left hand at the bottom, do noi come down to
the line, out are so cut as to give an irregular
appcarance to the word, the Tw and they go
ing below them.
The fjgnature I Nixon, has the appear
ance ot being written with lamb-black and
oil, and d>iters troni other inks fted in
printing the bills and the calhier's signature.
It is supposed theie forgeries were commuted
in tome ot the Southern fctaies, as all the coun
terfeits thai have appeared, have come from
thence, ana two peifons have been apprehend
ed in Virginia, on fuipicion ot being the author
of ihem.
The reward ot ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS
will be paid to any Perion or Ferfons wlio ihall
dilcovci and prolctuie to convittion the lever a J
offender* of the followiog dtfrnptions or any
of theqi, viz.
A" he person or ptrfons, who manufactured
the paper on which the Bills are printed.
The person x>r per lons, who engraved the
plates.
The printer or printers, Â©f the bills.
Â£vcry pei (on who has acted as a principal in
any othei way, in the counterfeiting and utter
ing the said bills.
Philadelphia, March 28, 1794
Other counterfeit bills
of the ol the Unitedbrates have apjeaiei.
in circulation.
The denomination is of TWENTY DOL
LAJtS,and the alphabetical mark is the let
ter is.
They may be diftmguiftied from the genu
ine by the lull Owing MARKS :
The paper of the counterfeits is of a mort
tender texture and glofley fur face than tbe
genuine, and there is no water mark in them.
Tke letter C. in the word Cashier, in the
true bills isftrongly marked, whereas in the
counterfeits, ihe whole letter is a fine hair
stroke, evidently in an unfinifhed state. The
letter a in the word demand, is badly Jornit-d
and the whole word ill done, and there is no
comma at the end of it. as there is in the
genuine bills.
The marginal device, is much daiker in
the falfe, than in the genuine bills owing to
the (hade strokes being coaifer, much nearer
together, and confequeritly much more nu
merous. This difference strikes the eye at firft
view.
The fame reward of ONE THOUSAND
DOLLARS, will be paid for apprehending, &
prosecuting to conviction the ieveral above
described Offenders in refpeft to this, as to
the last described bills.

Charlotte, a tale of Truth,
ItJ TWO VOLUMES.
By Mrs. ROWSON, of the New Theatre,
Phladelphia, Author of Victoria, the In.
quifitor, the Fille de Chambie, 4c.
Of Charlotte, the Reviewers have given
the folluiving character.
IT may be a Tale oi' Truth, for it is. not
unnatural, and it is a talc of real distress.â
Charlotte, by the artifice of a teacher, recom
mended to a school, from hnmanit; - rather
than a conviction of her integrity, or the re
gularity of her former conduS, is enticed
troin her governed, and accompanies a young
officer to AmericaâThe marriage ceremo
ny, if not forgotten, is postponed, and Char
lotte dies a martyr to the inconstancy of the
over, and treachery ot his fnend âThe fitu
tions are artless and affectingâthe defcrip
ations natural and pathetic; we fhuuld fee
for Charlotte if such a person ever existed,
who for one error scarcely, perhaps, deserved
so severe a punilhment. If it is a fiction,
poetic justice is not, we think, properly dis
tributed
