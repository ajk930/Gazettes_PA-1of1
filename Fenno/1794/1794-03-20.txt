that being so seised, Basil executed a power

THE grand principle of Equality, if right'

universal justice, sacred order, and perfect
freedom, can be firmly built, and permanent
ly secured. The view of it exhibited in this
eflay, at the fame time that it reprefles the
insolence of office, the tyranny of pride, and
thi outrages of oppreflioo ; confirms, in the
most forcible manner, the neceflity of subor

thority. So far indeed, from loosening the
bands of society, that it maintains inviolate,
every natural and every civil difti-nftion,
draws more clo r ely eVery foci'al tie, unites in
one harmonious and justly proportiorted sys

CASE: âKingston, Feb. ia, 1794.
u AN American veflel was loaded with
flour by her owners in America, and sent to
Port au Prince in Hifpaniola, where her car
go was fold and by means thereof, and bills
of exchange, a cargo was purchased on ac
count of the owners, consisting among other
things of the produce of Hifpaniola, in the
months of October, November, December
and January last. The veflel left Port au
Prince on the 12th 6f January, and was taken
by a British privateer on the feme day, and
sent down to this Island, where she arrived
before the publiftiing the inftru&ion of the
sixth day of November.
The cargo has been libelled as French pro
perty âand your opinion and advice is re
quested, whether under the foregoing circum
stances, the cargo will be condemned, riot
withftanding it is proved American property*
and whether a claim should not be put in on
behalf of the owners, notwithstanding the
said inftru&ion."
" I am of opinioh the inftru&ion ailuded
to, does not intend the condemnation of aU
it diredts to be stopped, and detainedâNor
can the term " legal adjudication" be so

the objedt of the inftru&ion is to guard a
gainst the too easy difmiflal of veflels and car

their own discretion, and also to insure the
interruption of the supply of provilions to

Britainâlf therefore the veflel and cargd

PHILIPPE EGALITE
AS the climax of virtue or crime cannot fail
to interest posterity, we are happy to lay
before the publiq the follo wing particulars
tive to the parracide monster Orleans.
The orders to conduct Orleans to Paris had
been given to two Parifiari citizens, Hofto and
Marchats. The former is a captain of the Nati
onal guards of the ftrttion of the Thuilleries; the
latter a captain of the Revolutionary army.. In
fti uftions were given them, to call troops to their
aid, if they (hould be wanted, for the purpose of
executing the orders with which they were char
ged.
Arrived at Marseilles, they fliewed their orders
to Orleans who was seemingly in great conster
nation. He appeared much surprised that tbe in
ftru&ions bore, that troops should be used to
conduct him to Paris ; but the two officers used
every persuasion which could inspire him with
courage and confidence. "You are only sum
moned to Paris." said they, "to appear before
the Revolutionary Tribunal, which will acquit,
and enable you to resume your feat in the Con
vention." "Are the people," asked Orleans,
"well disposed towards me?" "Nay," answered
the officers, "they not only love you, but they a
dore you as their idol 1" This reply quieted
the monster. "It requires no troops," said he,
Â« to bring me to Paris ; I repair thither with the
utmost confidence."
Cicero,
The officers then resolved to remove him with
out any other escort than themfelvea. Orleans
had by him a knife, a pair of fcifTors, and a me
tal tooth-pick. He offered to deliver these to
the officers-â" But," added he, "you will do
me a favour not to deprive me of them." HiÂ»
request was complied with.
He seemed to fuffer much when he parted from
histwo sons, Anthony Philip, now eighteen, and
the youngest, fourteen years of age. They in
treated him to write them immediately after hfÂ®
arrival at Paris. His treatment in the prison of
Marseilles was bad, and he fuftered many ri
gours, privation's, and hardlhips.
eodiw*u&ftf
On his way to Paris he difplayfcd his former
turn for ranth, and conviviality ; drank
freely, and, as his conductors exprefled, gre\Â»
lultier every night, going along. He even a
mused himfelf with fencing with one of hiÂ®
Guides. "Yout mode of fencing," s a id he to
the Captain, "delights me much ; I'll give yoa
my tw* sons to be your pupils."
The officers hhving told him on the road,-that
the Queen had been executed, he
Citizens ! (he was a great and flagitiods wretch."
They having alio acquainted him with the erfe-*
cution of Briflot and the twenty deputies, he tef.
rifi'ed great joy, and loudly exclaimed at diffe
tcnt times, Vive la Republiqve!
His removal to Paris was erfecutcd quite pri
vately. Having arived in the envirous ot the
fÃy Rtquejf.)

LONDON, Dec. 23,Metropolis, he had his beard (haved, his hair
drefled, and put on a fine suit of linen and cloaths
â¢'Now" said he, 44 I'll make a decent entry in-
to Paris."
Having, however, pafled through the tamers,
bow great was his furprile and difhrtay, when h<
vatftrJ'ghtcoudu&edtothe Comtergeiie. He
coi.ceakd his dt(appointment by a forced and
Hypocntic Imite.
With what fortitude' he heard his sentence.
has already been dated. The Picftdcnt of the
Tnbunal haviug asked him if he had any thing
to fay why the sentence of ihe Law thould not
take place he answeredâ"No I have no more
defenders."
H s execution was ordered for Thurfay Nov.
7th. but by bis own request, he was beheaded on
the fame day on which he rectived his doom.
He relufed the jiiiniftration of a Priest, and
spent the few hours he had to )ivÂ« in drcfling
hirofelf. At two o'clock in the afternoon, on
the 6th, ult. he received sentence, and at half
past thiee the fame day, the Executioner arrived
with his cart before the Conciergerie. Theftreeta
were more filled with people, than at the exe
cution oF Louis XVI { and that part of the mob
among whom he hdd formerly d-.ftributcd hi*
money, tnfuhed him mod, cfpecially the Ex-
Marquis deSt. Hurges formerly his hireling.
When he came to his palace the cart flopped
for three minutes, cither dehgnedly or on ac
count of ihe great crowds of people. He long
ipgly cast his eyes upon that fupetb mansion,
while the mob called yut, 14 Look, look, 'tis for
the Lft time."
On the fcaflold he attempted to harangue ihe
people, but their (houts drowned his voice.
At halt past five his head waji ftiuck off ; theex
ecuiioncr (bowed ii twice or thrice on the cor
ner of the fc>ffnld, while the mob mceffantly
Vociferated, Bravo! bravof Vive la Rcpubhque.'
Thus penfhed the molt ruthless monger that
ever polluted the Earth. Lou s Philip Joseph
Egaliie, late Duke of Orleans, firft Piince ol the
Blood, Lieutenant General of the French forces
by Land and Sea, was born at St. Cloud, April
*3> 1 747- ihe pupil of, Mirabeau, the
confidante of Dumourier and the client cf Petipn.
Previous to the R evolution, he was the richell
private man in Europe. In his youth he was a
bofoin friend of the Dauphin after wa<ds Louis
the XVI. whose blood he so much ihirfted Â«as-
Ccr. Wheu the Ktpg was innoculated in 1775,,
Orleans, then Duke of Chartres, wor.ld not quit
the King's apartment. The Duke of Orleans
h'S father, who lived in his letirement at St. Af
faire, never troubled himfelf about his monstrous
son, who, alteT his father's death wallowed in all
kinds of exccfTcs and debaucheries ; and even
*hea he succeeded to hb title, he waÂ» the wvoft
nefarious man ol his agr.
At court he was despised, for which reason he
cxpofed all its plans, being thefiift peer of France.
In 1787, Louis XVI. held a bed of Jufticc in
the Parl.ament of Paris, when Egali h addrefCed
him with so much boldncfs aud daring effronte
ro, that his Majesty exiled him from the Capita)
by a Letr re-de-Cachet.
On the 6th. of O&ober, 1789, Egalite and
Mirab rau went both in disguise to Vei failles,
wiih ihe Ft (h-Women, whom the former had
hired, in order to murder the Queen.

Friday, 14.
In committee of ike whole on Mr. MatTtfin's
refuhitions.
Mr. sedgwick's speech.
[concluded.]
Mr. S. then proceeded to state the re
gulations of Great Britain which directed
her intcrcourfe with this country âHe
laid that refpetting the Weft Indies, the
feme severe, rigid and gloomy exclusion
extended equally with us to all nations;
with this only difference of partial and
temporary relaxations in our fjvor, as in
her opinion her occasions reqflired That
refpefting an immediate intercotirfe with
Great Britain, her regulations were as
favorable to us at to any country, except
only where favors are the effect of direst
stipulationânay, they are more so as ref
pefis the important articles of pot and
peavl-afli, pitch, tar, timber, and an ex
emption from the payment of alien duties.
If then Great Britain did not discrimi
nate against usâif her discriminations
were favorable to us, where was our right
for complaint ? Should, however, unpro
voked resentment (for gentlemen would
remember to put political considerations
out of the que ft ion) stimulate the adoption
of the proposed measures, the disposition
*)f that country to retaliate would be cer
tainâher capacity of retaliation was there
fore to be considered.
This fubjeft Jie laid had been under the
consideration of the Britilh government.
Should (he fubjeft American (hips to alien
dutiesâ(hould (he impose duties on our
rice and tobacco and fucih other articles as
she can procure frbm other countries, and
on her products exported in our bottoms j
and (hould (he at the fame time counteract
our duties by bounties; their bounties
may be so given as compleatly to balance
our duties, and their duties of course a di
rect charge upon usâl charge on our ex
ports, for the reasons he had already men
tioned, depreciating their valueâa charge
on our imports to be fatisfied by the labor
and industry of the country, These would
be thefalutury effedts of this llcjfed system,
so far as the trade Ihould continue under
the load of thele opprefiive hardens. If
the commercial iutcrcourfe between Ame
rica and Great Britain lhou d be deitroyed
by this system of expensive irritation, the
evils were obvious, both as they would ef
fect the ease and prosperity of our people,
and the preservation of the public credit.
He had called the prelent channels of
commerce, the natural onesâthere would
he said, be found fuflicient reafou for the
appellation, without entering into an ex
tenlive inveiiigation of the subjeCt, in this
one observation ; that the present Hate
of our trade is produced by counting
house (Calculations having interell alone for
their objett.
It had been said that a great part of
our imports confided of the mere articles
of luxury. This was undoubtedly true*
but luxurious enjoyments could not be
prevented, unlets we would introduce
the manners of Sparta, and continue them
by the inititutions and laws of Lycurgus.
The paifion for diitin&ion could not be
controuled nor would it be eligible if it
could. "If then iaid he, we will use
Madeira wine and green teaâif we will
wear iilks, cambrics, muslins, and other
fuccedania of the fig-leaf, why should we
not be permitted to obtain them, when
they can beit be had, of the best quality
and on the bell terms ; or do gentlemen
suppose our constituents will acknowledge
obligations for being compelled to pro
cure them of inferior quality and on worse
terms ?
Gentlemen had given, countenance to
this project under au idea that it would
entourage manufafitures and the carrying
tradeâthis to his mind was preposterous.
He had always supposed that to establish
manufaflures, our active capital mult be
encreafed ; and to encourage navigation,
our trade must be extended. How this
measure which would lellen our active ca
pital by the embairaflment it would cre
ate, could afford the means of eftablilh
ing manufactures and building (hips, to
his mind was perfectly unaccountable.
He alked if it had not been demonft ra
ted that the measure would tend to en
hance the prise of the commodities
which we wanted to purchase, and de
crease the price of the products of our
country. It had indeed been conceded,
OmU these effects wefc unavoidable, and
yet these were the, means whereby we
were to extend our manufactures and na
vigation, Should, however, these effects
result, he aflced if we could feel ourselves
julhfied in facrificing to the encourage
ment of a few (hip-cai'penters and other
mechanics, the ease and comfort of that
moll ufeful and refpeftable description of
men, the farmer and planter ? One more
observation he said he would make on this
head, that any measure which might op
press the community, would be felt firft
and mod severely by the poorer class of
people.
Before the fubje<3 was difmifled it
ought to be viewed in a light in which it
was (hewn in the moll baneful colours
its tendency to war and all its dreadful
consequences. As the guardians of the
public happiness, we ought to avoid any
measure which tended to this, if it could
be done confident with the interest of our
country.
He laid it down as- a principle that every
aflion had its chara&er determined by the
motives which gÂ»ve it birth. What
motives then originated this measure ?
âWere they of a commercial, or po
litical nature ? Had G. B. inflicted any
commercial injuries on this country ?
Had (he not calculated her iemulations on
the feme principle of all other natronsâ
her own interest ? Had (he .discrimina
ted against us ? Did not the details clearly
(hew that her regulations Were as favora
ble to this as to other countries ! And
did not an infinitely more stubborn fa&,
the existing state of our trade, undenia
bly prove hers to be our bed markets ?
If then these mcafures are not juftified
on commercial considerations, will the na
tion towards whom thcyare directed, be at
a loss to determine our true motives? Jf
doubts could otherwise exist, rccourfe to
the printeddebatei would remove it. There
wefind our negroes carried off; the western
PÂ°^ s â-the Savages, Algerines, and in
(tructions to the commandcrs of (hips, the
constant theme of animated declamation.
We know too well the correftnefs of gen
tlemen's understandings not to be assured
that these fubjeÂ£tÂ» would not be so fre
quently repeated, if they were not design-
Ed to tiava effeS. These were not com
mercial, but political considerations. If
then the measure could not beâif it was
not juttified on commercial, but political
groundâif it was not designed ta I etali
ate for commercial, but for political inju
ries ; it followed irrefillably, that the mea
sure alfumed the complexion ot liability.
He did not mean to suggest an idea
but that the injuries complained of might
juflify hostile retaliation ; but he would
affirm, if this measure was designed as
such, it was infinitely too feeble, and
would certainly prove ineffectual. If war
was really the intention, it waÂ» our duty
boldly to declare itâand, like men, pre
pare for the event and not involve our
country in blood under the disguised pre-,
tence of our commercial regulations. If
we foutid motives for our conduit in an
tipathy to one nation, and in gratitude and
affection to another, and that this was the
cafe, he appealed to the printed debates
and to the faithful monitors of gentlemen
âwould it be supposed that Great Bri
tain would not undefftand, resent and en
deavor to revenge it ?
Great Britain he said, was involved in
a war, whether jufl. or not, the govern
ment of this country had no right to de
termineâjust or not, we had realon to
believe it was popular. While (he was pur
fwing this war, we complaining of inju
ries, and itimulated by a sense of them, a
dopt measures of retaliation, declaredly
intended to produce embarraflments of
filch a nature as to induce her to change a
course of conduct: (he has pr.rfaed for ages,
and tc which in her opinion (he is princi
pally indebted for her progreflive prosperi
ty-
If serious embarrassments are not to be
expctled, then ought the measure to be
abandoned, because it would not produce
the intended effeQ, and because it would
confeffediy be injurious to us.
Should it produce the embarraflments
foretold, it will materially alFeÂ£t those re
sources on which (he depends for the pro
fecution.of a favorite war. Should (he
feel those measures as intended, would it
not kindle resentment ? Would (he not
discover the cause ? And would (he not
fee! perfect felf-jiiftification in using all the
means in her power to revenge our parti
ality ?
Fne evil he said would not end here.
Great Britain was an important ally, and
on her resources the combined powers ma
terially depended for the prosecution of the
war. A war waged with as much enmity
as had provoked hollility at any period of
the exigence of civilized Europe. Should
we strike at those resources, and from mo
tives they will doubtlcfs comprehend ;
would they tamely submit to fncli condufl,
would they not refcnt and endeavor to re
venge it ? Â« I wflf repeat, said he, that
if your measures do not materially embar
rass Great Britain, and ia a cotifiderable
degree destroy lier resources, then will!
your expectations be disappointed", and the
end you propose defeated, and you only'
accumulate distress on your own citizefis-
If the embarreffinents you intend shall re
sult from your measures,. then do you in
fact take part in the warâyou will there
fore provoke the vertgeanee of the nation
againlt whom your meafuiea are directed,
and of her allies."
1 o (hew the natural effe&s of commercial
regulations pointed aguinft nations to' pro
duce hoÂ£iiity> he mentioned the war witich
took place between Great Britain and Hol
land} in 1652> occasioned by the navigation
a<sl or the formerâand that of 1672 between
the French and Dutch, in consequence of
duties imposed by the farmer on linen, and
by the latter on wine. There was he said,
peculiar reason for expetfing such an event
in the present instance, for by the treaty be
tween Great Brita;n and Spain, it was ex
pressly stipulated, Â« if either fhali be attacked,
molested or inquieteJ in anv of their ltates,
rights, pofleflions or interefl,." It Is then to
be made common cause.
This, lie said, was not all, our real views
would be known to our constituentsâ" They
are said he, a wile and penetrating people,
and will never consent to be dragged to the
carnage of war, under a pretence of com
mercial regulationsâTheir honeflcandor will
aohor apd detest all covert and crooked poli-
He did not mean to charge gentlemen with
unworthy motivesâHe could not however
avoid declaring the comment which in his
opinion woula be made, on experience of the
fatal events which would result from the
adoption of the proposed systemâa fyflem
incapable of benefit to the community and
pregnant with enormous evils.
He said before he difmified this part of the
fubjea, he would submit one observation to
the consideration of the committeeâlt was
that the navigation and manufactures of the
United States, had ia a few years pafl, en
creased with a rap.dity, equal to the expec-#
tatioiT of the molt sanguine friend of this '
country âThat this had resulted from the ex
isting systemsâThat he believed it to be true,
that at this moment, as great a portion of
our capital was invested in those branches as
was confident with the general welfareâ
Under such circumflani.es it became the le
gislature cautiously tp" adopt meafirrcs, which
might diftrail the present filutary order of
things.

Extract of a letterÂ» dated Bourdeaux, yVw.

' â¢' The affairs of France are in a t<ierable
Warn. Our armies perform wonders. We
hive retaken Toulon, and 2 convoys which

âI expeil this stroke: will depress the affairs
of our enemies not a little. They will be o

Extra 3 of a letter from William Ptnfofe,
late miifter of the Jhip President, to his
friend in Philadelphia t dated Algiers ylh
January 1794.
I have ju!t got another opportunity to
write you by Mr. William Patterfon, who
was taken with captain O'Brien, in a (hip
belongingto Messrs. Thomas and Mathew
Irwin of Philadelphia nine years ago, and
has been irl slavery here ever iince. But
thro' the influence of the Biitifh consul
resident here, has at last obtained his free
dom ; I beg you will give him a friendly
reception on my account,as he was a fellow
fufferer with me,& one who can give you
a much better delcription of our present
deplorable situation than I can do myfelf
col. Humphrey's the 'American minister at
he court of Litbon, dispatched a courier
to this puce Via Alicant to inform the
Dey that he was veiled by the Congress
of the United States of America
with full powers to treat for peace with
the regency of Algiersâbut the Dey not
only refufed to fee the courier, but declar
ed if Colonel Humphreys came himfelf he
would make a slave of him also; upon the
return of the coarier with the foregoing
answer from the Deyâ-Colonel Humph
reys wrote to us immediately, & requclted
us to petition for relief to the different
States to which our velfels refpe&ively
belongâwhich he tho't would be the mod
speedy method to effect our redemption if
there wasaprobabilityofits being doneâ
as Congress was engaged in a war with
the Indians on the wettern frontiers and
their finances perhaps embarralTed, to
gether with the present ciitical fit Bat ion
of America, with refpedl to the belliger
ent powers of Europe, would doubtless pre
vent Congress from paying attention to
our representations as soon as thev other
wise might be inclined to doâ-in confe
quense of which they have petitioned the
Legiflatmes ofPennfylvania, Virginia.and
South Carolinaâand I cannot entertain a
doubt but a recital of our fufferings, will
excite in thebofoms of humanity and sen
sibility, feelings fufficiently powerful to
prompt our generous countrymen to take
every reasonable measure to obtain our re-'
lease from the moll abject and deplorable
state of slavery. The total number of
American captives here are as follows
13 maflers, 13 mates, 4 second mates, 2
supercargoes, and 86 feamen,total number
118 and our ransom is fixed at 4,000 dol
lars for a mailer, 3,000 dollars for a mate
and second mate and supercargoes, and
I ,SOO dollars forafeamcn; ourmoftgrate
ful and unfeigned thanks are due to our
generous countrymen forthe immediate re-
lief tbey have afforded us through the
American minister at Lrfborc, Col. Hum
phreys, whiÂ«h is 8 dollars per Month to a
master 6 dollars per month to a firft and
second mate, and three dollars to a seaman;
which we receive through the SwedHh con
sul here which icrves in some meal'ure to
lighten the immediate sense of our fuffcr
ings.

COMMUNICATION.
The information from various quarters, as
it refpeds the Commerce of the United States,
and our political situation, is of the mod me
hnchoily nattfre ; and requires all the forti
tridey frLiil Snd resources of those to
direct the political concerns of the People.
When the welfare of our country is at (take,
all smaller ccrifiderations ought to give way,
that by an union of Councils such meafurts
may be adopted as will leflen the evils exist
ing, and prevent future calamities. If the
United States should be drawn into a War,
it is essential to carry it on with vigour and
success, that the whole continent (hould be
united. And the true friends of their coun

An EfTay on Slavery:
Designed to exhibit in a new point of view,
its effects on morals, indujlry> and the peace of
Jfociety. Some fatts and calculations are offered
to prove the labor of freemen to be much more
produQive than that ot Jlaves ; that countries arc
rich, powerful and happy, in proportion as the
laboring people enjoy the fruits of their own
labor ; and hence the neccffary conclusion, that
slavery is impolitic as well as unjujl.
