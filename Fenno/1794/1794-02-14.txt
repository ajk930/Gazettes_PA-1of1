I have, in my preceding remarks, ex
hibited a moral view of this question in
the atftraft. A single and summary ar
gument decides it in a few words, The
perfeSion of government is to render as
perfeS as poflible the moral system. States
or Sovereignties are artificial or corporate
persons, and as such, capable of moral
right and wrong. To render any system
of morals complete, every person, whether
natural or artificial {hould have, equal rights,
equal remedy for injuries, and an equal pow
er of rcfjhng injury or demanding right.â
If there is an individual in society, a na
tural person, who is not as fubjeft to all
the laws of the society, as every other in
dividual, his situation is raised above that
of his fellow-citizens, and he has the pow
er of exercising over them some acla of
tyranny. If. there is one person who
is not compellable to answer the demands
of his neighbors, he is or may be a ty
rant over them; for when men depend

SUABILITY OF STATES.
AND
on the discretion or integrity of another
for justice, they depend on his mere will
and pleafnre ; and this is precisely the de
pendence of Jla-ves on a maftcr âthe de
pendence of a Turk on the Grand Sultan.
It matters not whether this person, who
is exempt from the ordinary compulsion
of law, is a natural person, an individual
of the society, or an artificial person, a
corporate body. It matters not whether
this person i> a city, a fubordinatc cor
poration, or the sovereign body politic.â
The argument is conclusive in either cafe.
Wherever there are two persons capable
of having rights and duties; capable of
controlling with each other; to render
their facial, moral and political state per
fect, they must be on equal terms, quod
hoc; that is, so far as the contrast ex-
tends.
Now if one of the contrasting parties
is compellable to fulfil his stipulations, and
the other is not; in the name of reason
and common sense, let me ask, where is
the equality of their rights ? The oppo
fers of the inability of states are challenged
to answer this question.
mw&rftf
If then in our republican governments,
there is any power, either natural or arti
ficial which claims and enjoys the preroga
tive of doing justice to others, or not, at
its fo-vereign will and pleasure, that power
is so far despotism ; and the persons over
whom that power does or may exercise its
prerogative, are so far Jla-ves.
The reason is not pointed to the single
question as it refpefts the several states of
America ; it is applicable to the United
States so far as they form a Sovereignty ;
and to all sovereign states on earth. And
I am perfectly fatisfied that it is a perfection
of republicantfra, reserved for a more en
lightened period of the world, that free
sovereign states Ihall, in all contraÂ£ts or
stipulations, with individual citizens, whe
ther natives or foreigners, place themselves,
with refpeft to the administration of jus
tice, on a footing with individuals, render
themselves suable in courts of justice, and
make provision for carrying into effect pro
cess and execution against themselves. It
is pride, a haughty and domineering prin
ciple of the old world, that would contend
for the right of states to exercise an uncon
trolled discretion, which is often mere arbi
trary will and power, in the distribution
of justice towards private citizens.
Nor can I pass over the refle&ions call
on the judges of the supreme court of the
United States, for their decision on this
question. The clear explicit phraseology
of the constitution, one would think, might
save them from the sneers of certain gen
tlemen, in high stations, who, in deriiion,
pronounce them learned.âBut when we
consider the republican fin of the decision,
we may be aftonilhed at the blittdnefs of
opposition. Never did the judges of that
court deliver an opinion so perfectly re
publican, so perfefily recognizing the equal
rights of man, so perfectly hostile to the
proud domineering spirit of arbitrary will
and pleasure, as when they pronounced
the states to be compellable to answer the
demands of individuals. This decision a
lone might refute the charge of aristocra
cy, so liberally bestowed on those gentle
men. It is not republicanism but monar
chy and aristocracy that contend for the
dangerous power of doing as they please,
with individuals. Republicanism descends
from the throne of arbitrary will and plea
sure, and offers herfelf, on a footing with
her citizens, a defendant as well as plain
tiff, in the tribunals of justice.
What a strange absurdity do men in
dulge, when they zealously contend for
an arbitrary poivrr in many hands, which
they tremble at, in the hands of one man !
Is power the left to be dreaded, becaufeit
has changed hands ? If I have any idea
of despotism, it is mojl dreadful in the
hands of a large body of men. Legislative
powers in the hands of many, lose their
danger in the interejl which legislators have
in the lawsâThey themselves are fubjeft
to the laws which they ena& for the pub
lic. Here is an ark of fafety. But in de-
[Whole No. 5 13.]
cifions of the state between individuals
and itfelf, where is the principle that can
control the narrow, partial, felfilh, pre
judiced views of man ? Will universal in
tegrity ensure justice ? Will reputation,
where no man can be accused, guarantee
a uniform, impartial adrniniflration of jus
tice ? Will honor always triumph over pri
vate paflions, secret prejudice and motives
of interest ? Let any man lay his hand
upon his bread, while he reasons on this
fubjeft, and while he reviews the proceed
ings of our legislatures towards individual
suitors for justice ; and fay, if he can,that
a man's rights are fafe in the hands of dis
cretionary fovercign power.

Mr. Fenno,
THE enclosed animadversions on a

chus, which appeared in the General Ad
vcrtifer on Monday the 10th inlt. were
sent to the Editor of that paper yesterday
for publicationâHe has since returned
the manofcriptâwith a declaration that
the reflections on the French Minister,
are inadmissible ! !âlt is in vain thrft Mr.
Bache should pretend, that it is proper to
avoid refle&ions on a person, who, he
fays, is not accountable to the American
people; for if that person intrudes him
felf into American politics, and by him
felf, or his creatures attempts to impose
on the public mind in the Newspapers,
no good reason can be assigned why hit
conduct (hould escape ccnfure.
Philad. Feb. 11
For the General Advertiser.
Mr. Bache,
" THERE are Hypocrites in Politics
as well as Religion i" Men who, under
a made of profeffion, conceal principle*
most opposite to it. Such a canting hy
pocrite I take your correspondent Grac
chus to be. He pretends an attachment
to Liberty and Republican principlesâ
nay, which is more impudent Hill, he
pretends to understand them ; yet like a
true son of Ambition, grasps at controul
ing, singly, the opinion of almost four
millions of freemen. Disguised as a de
mocrat, and united with a junto of simi
lar complexion, he would no doubt gladly
obtain the direction of the public mea
sures for himfelf and his creaturei. With
this view they continually attempt to vili
fy the officers of our government, the
worthy objects of republican confidence
&aprobation;&obtrudetheirimpertinence
upon the public eye, under a pretext of
being the friends of the people ; of that
very people who would scarcely, perhaps,
chufe them for Constables, much less the
Watchful Centinels of their moll precious
interests.
The envious Philippic of Gracchus,
who mistakes the impudence of feftion for
republican freedom, it directed against the
muit dignified and unexceptionable public
character which ever conduced the admi
nistration of any government. He at
tempts, almofl sacrilegiously attempts, to
rob our beloved President of as well-earn
ed laurels, as ever adorned a human brow.
From the particular charges exhibited
by that malevolent incendiary, one would
suppose his performance to be the despe
rate effort of a disappointed man, or some
of his satellites of mifchief, fufficiently
known in America.
By such ii.lk'.iotis methods, lie hopes,
to {hake the public confidence in their
Chief Magistrate, But let him, whoever
he 1 be, know ; let him hear it from a plain
citizen and as ftauch a republican as he
pretends to be ; that the Prelident of the
United States is the choice of American
Citizens ; that they have viewed his civil
administration with the fame admiration
and delight, which filled their hearts when
he became the instrumental Saviour of
their country at the head of its embattled
youths ; that lie lives in their hearts ; and
that a ltroke Impinging against him, tb e
A. B.puUic R 'nvtfr.r.t.V've. vibrates tliro* t'le
>i every leal America* citizen
in the remote!t corrvr oS the United
States, who fe.lVliimfeh perfoiittlly insulted
thereby. Let Grncchut:, let his abetters
know, that tjjouiands and ten thouiands
in this extensive country, cherifhthe name
(it Washing Ast, as The* vital blood which
animates their hearts. Let these men
know that the envenomed fhafts of envy
which thjy aim at this unsullied character,
will like arrows (hot agsfinlt the fun,
with vengeful force upon their own heads.
L-Jt them know that the people of Ame
rica, are men of principle, of iteady cha
racter and the molt solid judgment ; that
they do not change their opinions, men
and manrters with every moon ; and that
t hey liibjctl bcUlkt the heads of their de
fj. ving CitiZens to the bloody Guillotine
6? France, nor their fame to the unceaflng
guillotine of malicious pens.
Having yield:d tinis far to the emoti
ons of a.i iiidigiiHal, hunpft heart, rouged
bv its attachment to liberty, which has
b.'en wounded in the character of her fiill
born Son, I can proceed the more pati
ently to consider the production of Grac
chus, in some detail, and offer a few Uric-
tuv* u;5(-n it
His <.'_>T.C7Til in the beginning
arc; true in thviafelves, but without an ob
ject at this day. They are certainly in
applicable to the cafe, with which he con
nects theni. He fecms, either not to un
deritand, or not to dillinguifn between an
"implicit reliance upon influential men ;
and a gearrrus c& hdepce in those servants
of the public, whose fidelity has been se
verely tÂ«!red on many important occasions,
& proved incorn ptiblc. Unequivocal proofs
of the moll: inviolable integrity direified
t;ie choice of Ana ica to the President of
tiie United States ; and continued expert
eiwc cOi.-5..-ms their opinion of his merit.
His emiuetit capacity for executing im
portant trulls chid his unparalleled fidelity
have united all generous, judicious, noble
lpirits in his favor
This has called him repeated])' and una
ii:rn >ufly to that conlpicuous pollin which
he lo worthily represents the sovereignty
of theAmeriean States.
He is the people collectively ; foi he is
cliafcn by their fuiiragc ; to speak in their
name ; to ad with their power ; and to
m?.;iagc with Angular IcfjXHiiibilitycertain
fpecfiitd a;.d important concerns of the
government, on their belialf. He is thus
a lovereign not of the people, but for the
people, to trail fact our bujinefs with so-
reign lovereigntie6, and to cany into exe
cution the public will, lawfully exprefTed.
This kind of fupremacv he has obtained
hv the only legitimate title, the OPINI
ON, the KNO WLEDGE, the CHOICE
of the people. And will Gracchus dare
to fay, #ciat the opinion, the will of the
peup'e thus largely colleded, ought not
to prevail ? VV ill he avow a feutiment
and yet, with unblushing front, pretend
to repuhlicanifm ? Will he impertinently
fuppoft for a moment, that we ought to
submit our opinion to his, and withdraw
our confidence from the man of our hearts,
to place itâupon whom ? E. lightened
fellow citizens 1 upon whom ? upon some
disguised foe to our liberty, happinefs,and
peace ; some dark affafiin, whose best fe
ctiriry isâhis unknown name ! ! To men
tion this monstrous phenomenon, as a pof
frble event, even in our rcra of political
wonders, is to expose it to the most ex
prefiive contempt.
The sllufions to Tufcany and Rome are
the wildest imaginable. Can ignorance
itfclf fitppofe,or is prejudice hardy enough
tft suggest a parallel between George
Washington, the firft of men, and the
artful Cofmo, the bloody and terrific Syl
la, or the ambitious Caesar ? between pow
er committed in trust by frequent, unbias
sed choice, and, power afyimcd and inde
finitely exercised, thro' the insidious arts,
or the r" Ltary force devoted to the ambi
tious will of those despots ? between an
enlightened and comparatively virtuous
nation, in the youth of freedom ; and
people e> ervated by luxury and ready to
submit their servile necks to the firft mat
ter w hit was bold enough to command
them or richenoughto purchase their pros
tration, by fumiftiing unbounded enter
tm'nmentJ and expensive raree-lhews ?
As Giucchus has tired egregioufly in
the application of ancient facts to the prc
fent filiiation of America, so he is not
lifs mistaken hi his interpretation of the
recent governmental atls of the PreHdent,
which he has fpecified, and which he af
firms to have heen " incompatible with the
spirit of a free government.'"
The difaifilon of Du Plaine from Jiis
consular luuttioiw tor a daring outrage up
on the-authority of this country, a fatt
authenticated by the clearest evidence, was
an ;>.ct the molt salutary in itfelf, the most
neceflary from its citomittances, and per
formed in a conltitutional manner by tfye
Pidident, who in ail such public traufae
tions, is the only organ to expreis the Na
tional will. To talk of a trial by jury in
a cafe of that fort, is a weak attempt to
r,-.:(lezd by the fuund of words ; and is
just as ridiculous "s to expect that the In
dians should- be tried by a jury before Gen.
Wayne fhali treat them as enemies ; or
Great Britain, before Congrcfs had dis
cussed Mr. Madison's Resolutions. Yet
Gracchus asserts that this necelfarv severi
ty was ' an outrage upon the trial by ju
ry,' which in f.ift, as has been (hewn,
was not applicable to a circumstance of
that nature ; and that ' the Consul's con
duA was fnl jud'ice, when the proclama
tion declared his guilt ,' nav further, he
inhnuates, that a jury of uur country ac
quitted him in the very instance wherein
the proclamation pa(fcdfcv.ence upon him.
Is this fact ? Or is it not a gross mifre-
calculated to deceive the un
wary > If Du Plaine was. tried by a jury
lat all; was it not with regard to a ques
tion of property or damages ; altogether
diltiuiX from the public breach of the
peace, for which his exequatur was revok
ed Does this writer ignorantly or insidi
ously thus confound these two different ob
jedta ?
The fame ignorance or insidious design,
has induced Gracchus, to separate, as
Mr. Genet also usually does, the people
of America, from their government.â
This he has attempted in his statement of
Henfield's cafe, as well as that of Du
Plaine. But, as well might the body be
diltinguiflied from its form, or matter from
its colour and shape, ae under our cotiftitu
tiou, the people and their government be
separated. How long time will these un
fledged republicans require, to learn, that
our government is the appointment of the
people themselves, their ostensible repre
fentativc ; and the organ whereby they
expreis their will! Surely the general
voice of counties, cities and towns, in va
rious parts of America, in favour of the
President's official conduit, is a decided
proof that there is no repullion between
the people and their owh constituted au
thority ; as falfefly asserted by Gracchus
from the proceedings of one or two un
informed juries: and the tremendous re
solves of a county or two in Virginia,burr
ed in ignorance of what passes in the poli
tical world,except what they receive thro'
the partial medium of a disappointed par
ty !*
The firmnefs and wisdom with which
the President bafÃed the repeated attempts
of Genet to disturb our happiness and
peace, have been decidedly and honora
bly appiovcd by Congress. The â¢ dignity'
and candor of that Minister is fnfficiently
obvious to all, who compare his unquali
fied declarations on his firit arrival in A
merica, with his succeeding and avowed
attempts to involve us in war ; and those
public inftru&ions which he afterwards
pulled out of ' his pocket' as the French
interpretation of the treaty. His factious
and intemperate conduct, and his ' undis
guised' impertinence, not so much to the
President as an individual, or to the deli
cate sensibilities of some imaginary court,
as to the â¢ Sovereign and independent Re
public of America,' in her Representative
or Chief Magistrate, has involved him in
just suspicion, and degraded him into an
object of just contempt. Finally the af
fair of the Southern Sicarii, who have re
ceived coinmiffions from him to commit
the peace of their country with Spain, and
liis wretched explanation of that dark bu
siness has finifhed his career, and rendered
him an odious object of abhorrence. The
palliative complaints therefore of Grac
chus upon the fubjeft of this, almost, ex
minifter of France, and his coarse reflec
tions upon the worthiest Magistrate in all
the world ; are nothing but the effufions
of a fretted and cankered heart, and de
serve nothing but indignant reproach,
from every honell man.
To conclude, though I dislike and re-

â¢were pubtifhed ; I believe itlfo, re-publijhed

In committee of ihe whole on Mr. MadiforC s
rcfolutions
Mr. Clark observed that having made a
calculation of the time which had alreSdy
been expended in the difcuflion of this bu
siness, he found it amounted to seven days
â-He believed no legislative body ever be
fore consumed so much time in delibera
ting on one fubjeftâhe hoped therefore,
the committee would come to a vote im
mediatelyâany furthei expence of time
he said would be to no purpose, and would
be difgraceful to the legillature.
Mr. Hillhoufe in replying to Mr. Clark
said that it was the right of every gentle
man to aflign the reasons for his public con
duct if he saw proper, for his part he did
not wi(h to consume much of the time of
the committeeâhe was not in the habit
of making long speechesâand tho' he
could not charge the member last up with
exhausting the patience of the house, yet
he never failed of exercising a right wliich
he now appeared to wilh to deprive others
ofâbut notwithstanding the remarks of
the gentleman, Mr. Hillhoufe laid he
thought it his duty Rot to give a Clent
vote on a fubjedl of fueh magnitudeâhe
had heard with pleasure, and had been
much inftru&ed by the observations that
had been made, and wilhed to hear what
further might be said on a fubjeft that
might $ffeÂ£t the most important interests
of his country âFor some time pad he
had, from his own observation, from the
high price which our produce had borne,
and the great demand there had been for
it in the markets, from the pressing de
mand for seamen, and from the concurrent
testimony of merchants, and people of
every occupation, been lead to believe,
that the commcrce of the United States
was in a most prosperous trainâhe had no
,reason to ful'peCt his opinion till those re
folutious were brought forwardâThey
him the more, as coming from
a quarter of the country, from which he
left txpefted any thing of the kindâand
from which, only two fetlions since oppo
sition was made to measures which had
the fame object in view, so far as refpefts
the encouragement of navigation and ma
nufa&ures, beCause it was said, that such
encouragement, tho' it operated to the
advantage of the eastern, was a direct tax
on the southern statesâthis made him lcfs
solicitous at that time, to urge mealures
that might have an unequal operation on
the different parts of the union.âWhat
great event has turned up fmce, to work
this extraordinary change ? He supposed
the gentjeman must have difcovcred some
great hnpofitions and embarralTments on
our trade, which had escaped his atten
tion, he had therefore listened with gicat
attention, to hear them pointed outâas
to tbcorict, he thought they ought not to
be attempted, but in extreme cases, unlcfs
the objeÂ£t was important, and its attain
ment certain ; he had enquired into the
reftriftions laid by Great-Britain, on the
commerce of the United States, and from
that enquiry, as well as from the report
of the Secretary of State, he found that
the fame reftri&ions are laid on other na
tions, that there is no marked diftin&ion
against us, but that the United States en
joyed many, and great advantages over
other nationsâHe thought it unnecessary
to go into a particular detail of those ad
vantages, as the other gentleman had al
ready done it. He therefore was of opi
nion, that to adopt the measure now un
der consideration, would be hazarding
those advantages for the uncertain chance
of obtaining something which was only
in profpeft. A gentleman from Virgi
nia, (Mr. Giles) had mentioned the dif
criminating favoritism of Britain, to other
neutral powers, viz. Denmark and Swe
den, which was the only instance that
even the ingenuity of that gentleman, ia
gacious in finding out difficulties, could
point tout in the navigation laws, or com
mercial regulations of Great-Britain, in
which any discrimination was made to the
disadvantage of the Ui.ited Statesâand
even that is not one of which we can
complain ; it was a regulation adopted iu
coni'equence of her present fitUatiuii, 8,
being in a ltate of war, and not for com
mercial purposesâthe article complained
oi, is in theie words: " That it lhall be
lawful for the commanders of his Majcfty's
fliips of war, and privateers, that have,
or may have, letters of marque agairill
France, to seize all ships, whatever be
their cargoes, that (hall be found attempt
ing to enter any blffekaded port, and to
fend the fame tor condemnation, together
with their cargoes, except the Ihips of
Denmark and Sweden, which (hall only
be prevented from entering 011 the firft at
tempt, but on the second, shall be sent in
for condemnation likewise"âThis article
needs no other comment, or jnllification,
than to read the remark of the Secretary
of State, in his letter to the Britilh Mini
ller on this fubjeftâ" We had conjectur
ed, but did not before certainly know, that
the diftin&ion which the injlr nations makes
between Denmark and Sweden on the
one hand, and the United States 011 the
other, in the cases of velfels bound to ports
blockaded, was on the principle explained
by you, that it was yielded to those coun
tries by treaty, it is not unfriendly to re
fufe to us, lecaufe, not yielded to us by trea
ty. I shall not contest the right of the
principle, as a right to its reciprocity nc
eeflarily results to us." And it is upoa
this ground, that our conduit in admitting
French privateers and prizes into our ports,
& excluding those of Great-Britain, isjuf
tifiable ; if then, the advocates for the ic
folutions, cannot find out any inltance in
which Great-Britain has made difcrimina
tiuns to our advantage, and many inltan
ces are Ihewn, in which we enjoy advan
tages beyond the moll favored nations;
can we complain ?
A. B.
The United States have not a fuffici
ent number of (hips to become the carriers
of her own produce, and he much doubted
whether the time was come when it would
be for the advantage of the United Stater
to extend their navigation so far as to an
iwtr that jjurpofe ; and should an impru
dent adoption of these resolutions deprive
us of Britilh veflels, our produce would
perish on our hands. Since we have not
{hipping equal to the carriage of our whole
exports, we- can surely find fufficient em
ployment for those we have, independent
of the trade to the British Weft-India
islands; and tho' it would be a defnable
thing to be admitted into that trade, yet
is that an objedl of so much importance,
that we could be juftified in hazarding the
moll importaut ir.tereils of our country to
obtain it ? If the advancement of our na
vigation and manufaftmes is the rial ob
ject, t.-hy adopt the difcrimi.iating qua
lity ? Is it not putting us in the power of
other nations, ar.d giving them great ad
vantages without an equivalent ?
Since it is admitted that we do not en
joy any special advantage from any com
mercial treaty we now haveâit is my o
pinion, that if any regulations are adopt
ed they ought to be generalâif any na
tion wifhcs for an exemption and will give
us an equivalent we can secure rt to them
by treatyâif we secure to them the ex
emption by law, they will be under no
inducement to grant it as an equivalent
France whose interest is intended to be
advanced has never come forward and ie
quefted such a discrimination. Why then
should we do it unsolicited ? Ought we to
return the late generous and friendly con
duct of Portugal, by extending the dis
crimination to that nation ? The gentle
man who brought forward the resolution*
seemed to lie l'enfible of the impropriety
of such a measure, and therefore, propo
sed to draw a line which should exclude
that kingdom ; this would point the re
fjlutions so directly again It Great Bri
tain, that it would be much better to
come out in an open and manly way and
call her by name, than to do it in this
indirect mede. He closed fiis remarks
on this part of his argument, by faying
that it was a question that admitted of
some doubt, whether the commerce of
the United States was not at present in as
piofperous a situation as was for the inâ¢'
tereft of the country ; and, whether it
would be for the genera] welfare to giveit a greater stimulus than it now had, so
as to divert the young men and farmers,
sons from other occupations and elpeciai
ly that of agriculture, and by that means
under the pretence of encouraging na\i
gation, to do a real injury to America ?
He said he would now bellow a few
observations on the political considerations
which are urged to induce the adoption of
these resolutions ; and a gentleman from
Virginia (Mr. Giles) has told us that
three quarters of his arguments and in
ducements for adopting them are deri
ved from that quarter. Say the gentle
men, the treaty of peace has never been
complied with on the part of Great Bri
tain : Thev excited a savage war on cur
frontiers, and Algerine depredations on
our commerce.
These are iejious evils that readily ad
dress themfelvcs to our paflions, and any
attempts to palliate or lelfen their influ
ence, could not, he was sensible, meet
with a very favourable reception. When
we are,, however, called upon to delibe
rate upon great national concerns, which
involve both the honor and most impor
tant interests of our country, we ought
to examine with the cool deliberate eye
of a judge, and not under the influence
of passion. That Great Britain has vi
olated the treaty, does not admit a doubt,
and that (he was also the firll to violate ;
but if we lock at home, {hall we not have
the candor to own, that we,havea!fo vio
lated that treaty ? Do not foine of the
public officers admit that we have ? There
are mutual complaintsâand the Execu
tive have put that in a train of negotia
tionâand as the various ads of the State
Legislatures, the adoption of this govern
ment, which has opened the Federal
Courts in an honorable manner to the
claims of British fubje&s, has removed
the principal ground of complaint against
the United States. And the able and
mailer!y manner in which the Secretary
of State has arranged and brought up
the matter, he flattered himfolf would fa
tisfy the court of Great Britain, and in
duce a full compliance with the treaty on
their part, he thought the matter was.re
duced to such a fituatton that (he could
not withhold her compliance. A letter
has been lent to the British Court thro'
her -Min+fter on the fubjÂ£&, to which 110
anfvver has yet been receivedâand one
gentieman has gone so far as to call the
delay a firjh injult.
He thought that candor lequired that
we (hould admit tliat the reason they had
given for this delay had some wait.â
Have not we ourselves confidercd Great
Britain as being in a very critical lituation ?
Has not that in fact been the cafe ? Have
they not conlidered the government it
fclf as being in danger ? If a man's house
was on fire, was it to be supposed that his
attention could be engaged in regulating
the mere unimportant concerns of his fa
mily ? Surely 110 candid man will fay that
the government of Great Britain are ve
ry criminal for having delayed an anfvvcr
to those representations, which have been
forwarded from this country. It could
not be expe&cd that they would instantly
lay aside all their great national concerns,
to decide upon themâit docs not seem to
have been expected by the executive.
He. noticed in the President's inftruc
tiows to Mr. Pinckncyâhe was directed
not to commit himfelf by ill timed or too
ardent demands; he was to urge an an
swer as much as pofiible, without commit
ment, and on the firlt day of December,
to give information of the (late in which
the matter was. The time in which we
might expect an answer, is not yet arri
ved. We ought to wait a reasonable time
âif the answer (hould be unfavorable,
and all hopes of success from negotiation
should fail, and there (hould be 110 prof
peft of a compliance with the treaty on
the part of Great Britain, it will then
be time enough to bring the fubjcCt un
der confederation. He wished to have it
fairly brought up unconnected with any
other natter, and fucli meafurcs adopted
as (hould be judged best upon mature
deliberation, and after deeply weighing
evtry ciicmnftar.ce. At present the fub
jcCt appeared to him to be prematurely
brought forward.

CONGRESS
House of RcprefentaU vt
Friday, Feb. 14
A message from the Senafe by Mr.
Ofcis their secretary, informed the house that
the Senate have pafled' the bill for the re
lief of Thomas Jenkins and Sons.
The house then proceeded in the consi
deration of the report on the Delaware e-
leclion.
The qucftion for agreeing to the clause
which fhtcs that John Patton is not duly
ele&ed to fcrve as a member being put,
was carried in the affirmative, nearly una-
nimous.
The clause of the report which states
that Henry Latimer is duly eleÂ£te<J, be
ing put, a debate ensuedâ
The qudtion was at length determined
by yeas and uavs, 57 in favor of agreeing
to the clause and 31 against itâMr. La
timer was accordingly qualified, and took
his feat in the house.
The Governor of New-jersey has, by
proclamation, dated the l.oth iiiftant, ap
pointed the 20th of next month, to be held
throughout the State, as a day of Thanks
giving and Praite.
A correspondent hopes, that the pre
sent republican Congrcis will, among other
republican acts, bear a teltimony against
every practice, the offspring of monarchy.
Birth-day celebrations are inconsonant
with republicar.ifm, and as such ought to
be proscribed by every man who willies to
preserve the purity of the principleâlt is
to be hoped, that the representatives of
the American nation, will not fuffer a sus
pension of their funftion6, by an adjourn
ment, to ast the part of courtiers. If la
dies and beaux take a pleasure in keeping
up this farce, that they may have an op
portunity to !hew their fine cloaths, and
display a pretty form,foot, â  hand, or face,
it cannot be supposed that the American
Legislators are under the influence of such
frippery. Gen. Ad.
The chairman of the feleft committee
on the poft-office law, yellerday commu
nicated to the house when in committee of
the whole, a letter from the Post-Master-
General, received since the report was
drawn up, of which an extract follows :
The abuses practised by means of prin
ters' newspapers, and the great and, for
the moll part useless burthen of them in
the mails,. induce me to suggest for consi
deration whether it will not be expedient to
charge them with the fame pojlage as those
of their fubferibers ? In this cafe we should
rid the mail of much lumber and make
room for something of value. The Print
ers in the few great sea-ports receive large
packets of newspapers by every poll, many
of which they do not unfold. One of the
Baltimore printers lately informed me that
he makes no other ufeof mcft of them than
to furnifh the neighboring' (hops with
waste paper. Hardly any one printer
would theu take more than fix or eight
newspapers: now they receive from 30 to
50 or 60. Two years ago about 600 were
received weekly at the Philadelphia Post-
Olfice, for the printers of that city alone.
If they are now charged with pcftage,
the printers in half a dozen of the largcft
towns may, perhaps, agree on mutual ex
changes, to the number of fix or eight.
The printers in other towns would proba
bly content thcmfelves with the best pa
pers printed in their own capital, and a
couple from the feat of the general go
vernment.
Formerly Printers used to publish the
lifts of dead letters gratis : now they de
mand and receive pay ; and in the large
offices this expense is considerable. In
Philadelphia it amounts to a hundred dol
lars a year ; though done at rates below
the usual advertising prices. This cir
cumftancc at leaf! lejfens their title to the
favor of receiving their papers free. If
by means of the proposed reftriftion the
Printers' newspapers were reduced (as
they would be) four-fifths in number, it
would be more praÂ£tieable to expedite the
conveyance of them ; and expedition would
much more than counter-balencc the ex-
pencc.

" Seven days after I left Boston, got

immediately into deeper water.âBut it
continued to blow so severe, that I hove
her too under a balanced reefed forefail,
to range offâthis was 8 o'clock in the

blowing terribly, I (hipped a sea, which
entirely cleared the deck, wafting over

and put the helm up, before my people
got the mate aboard, who was 15 feet

hold of the cable, and so was laved : But
the boy we never saw after ; his name is

for four minutes. The fore-fail split, and
then Â£he righted. In five days after, we
got fight of the Capes again, and was a
gain blown off. This gale blew all my

of the molt severe gales I ever knew, and

HAS Lately received a number of article;;

remarkable bird called the Cut-water, or fcif
ars-bill; The Avofette, commonly called the
Shoe-maker, because of its bill resembling a
crooked awlâThe Long-leg.*, commonly call
eJ the Black-bet, having perhaps the longed legs,
in proportion to the fire of the bird, of any of
i he feathered tribeâThe Storm-finch, coromoo-
W failed mother Cary's chickenâThe Sea
fwallow, and various Gulh ; betides a variety
ol Cranes, Curlews, Snipes, See.
The scull of a Whale and one of its Vertebres.
An Indian hatchct made of chiyÃal : It is
curious that those uninformed wild people, hav
ing very little knowledge of the arts, and being
ignorant even of the existence of iron and steel,
ftiould be able to form such hard fubftanÂ«es in
to fanciful forms as this, and othir Indian ma
nufactures now in the Museum.
A lignified Quince : The specimen (hews
what a rcmaikable effect a dry warm (ituation
has on fruit. It is now about 8 years Gnce it
was gathered ; and 1 1 was a real quince, now be
come wood, at lead in appearance.
Presented by Mrs. Manfon of Charleftown,
S. C.âa tool used by the O'.aheitans in making
their bark cloth, by pounding the bark on this
instrument of wood, it produces the ribs which
resemble threads : the perfc&ly straight and
equal lines made in this extreme hard wood, by
men without the use of iron,are curious & won
derful.
Also, a rope made of grass, part of> the rigg
ing of a vessel of Kamfkatka.
Presented by Dr. Hall, of Lewis-town, a Squib
in spirits : when this fifh was found, a number
of ftoncs were appended to firings or ligaments
that proved from the front of its head,which
occasioned a conje&ure, as it is not furniftied
with fufficient fins to refill the violence of the
tide and currents, that it fattened with these li
gaments on whatever it found at the bottom ; so
that the stones answered the purpofeof anchors
and the ligamentsof a glutinous sticky nature,
that of cablet. Some of the (tones are in the
fame phial.
A coiledion of Minerals and other Fossils-
Â» r e now displayed in drawers covered with glass
and in a mode which will feeure them from de
raugement. To each fpccimen are affixed refe
rences to a book of descriptions. This manage
ment of specimens of the Fossil kingdom, ren
ders this part of the Museum very convenient
and fatisfa3ory,and great attention will be paid
to the systematical order of them, and in mak
ing the necefTary essays of each : Also in giving
in a concise manner, the various uses they are
applied to ; thereby rendering them the more
interesting to the public.
A Living Elk, of ztycm old, is just receiv
ed. By the account which monf. Buffon gives
of the Elk, it appears that he was not acquaint
ed with this American animal; he particularly
omits all notice of the curious apertures adjoin
ing the eyes of this Elk.
George Bringhurft,
COACH-MAKER,
In Mulberry (Arch) between Fourth and Fifth
Streets, adjoining the Episcopal burying
ground,
TAKES this opportunity of returning his
grateful thanks*to his former employers,
and requesting their future favors, as well as
tbofe of the public in general.
He continues to make and repair at the
(horteft notice, all kinds of pleasure carriages,
such as coaches, chariots, phztons with and
without crane necks, coachees, chaises, kitte
reens, windsor fulkeys and chairs, and barnefs
of e vory description, in the neatest and newest
fafhion now prevailing in the United States.
And as he has a quantity of the best seasoned
wood by him, and capital workmen, he has
not the lead doubt but he will be able to give
fatisfa&ion to those whopleafe to employ him.
He has for fate, several carriages altnoft
finifhed, such as coacbee*, an Italian windsor
chair, hung on steel springs, a light phzton for
one or two horses, and a fulkey with a falling
top.

THIS volume contains principles of Levels,

Madagascar, Magic, Magnetism, Malts, His

Miscellaneous articles, illullrated with Twen

As a number oi families are still in the
country, and it is not generally known who
arereturned. T. Dobfon, foJicits the favor
of the fubfcrsbers to call or fend for their vo
lumes, that they may be supplied as early as
poilible.
The tenth volume of the Encyclopedia is
now presented to the public; but as it makes
its appearance in an impcrfeft state, some ac
count of the reason of that iraperfe&ion fliould
be given. On the Bth of September last, the
Publisher had the misfortune of having his
Printing-Office burnt down by a fire which
broke out in the neighbourhood, and a great
quantity of his printing materials destroyed,
and among other articles, the figukes, with
which he was printing the tables or lo
garithms, belonging to the present volume,
were melted down by the violence of the fire.
As a supply of these could not be immediately
obtained, be was under the necessity of pub
lilhing the volume without these taeles; but
hopes ic (hall be able to publish them with the
next volume which is now in considerable for-
wardnefs.
The Publisher embraces this opportunity of
exprefling bis grateful acknowledgments to
the generous public, for the very liberal pa
tronage with which his undertaking has been
honored; at the fame time he takes the li
berty of representing to fucb of the fubferibers
as are in arrears, the indifpenfible neccflity of
punctuality, both in taking up the volumes a*
early as possible after publication, and of pay.
ing for them when taken. Many of the fub
feribers having got only one, two, three, L'c.
volumes, and several volumes remain vnp aid.
Thus the work hangs in all its different ftagei
from the commencement; and though rbe im
portance of a* few dollars may be but a trifle
to the individuals, yet the accumulation of
these trifles ukpmd lays the Pobliflier under
very serious embarrailment, and deprives him
of the use of many Thousands of Dollars which
at this time would be of very eflential service.
For tbefe reasons the Publiiher finds him felt
under the necessity of recurring to the original
terms of publication, and in future no vo
lumes will be delivered but only to those who
take and pay to the time of publication.
