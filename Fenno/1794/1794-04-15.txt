The Texture oi' the Paper is thicker and
whiter and it takes the ink more ficely than

The O. m the word Company is smaller

The engraving is badly executed,the ftiokes
of ail the Letters are fttoiiger and tile devil!
iu the margin particularly is much cuailer and
appears darker ihan in tlie true bills. Some

T<wenty Dollar Bills of the Bank of North

ALL that have appeared have ihe letter

They are printed on a paper nearly similar
to that of the cuuuterfeit Five Dollai Notes

The fine ruled lines through ihe woid Twen

The word Company is much like the fame

There is no stroke to the t in the word North
whereas in the genuine bills the stroke is well

From Correspondentsâ¢
France is now regenerating her marineâit
is expected that in one year from this, Hie
French navy will confilt of upwards of 100
fail of the line. Should this country enter ill
to the war, we may expert the most power
ful succours from our ally. At leail a fleet
of 30 fail of the line, and 10,000 veteraji
troops. Such a force will be absolutely neceT
fary to effedtuate the reduction of Canada
a measure which every diclate of policy
will urge as eligible. This plan will keep
the United States at a proper remove from
the vortex of European pplitics !
There is plenary evidence daily laid be
fore the public, to ftiew that all tli-e vexa
tions, spoliations, and depredations of the
British cruiffrs on the commerce of this
Country, are the most plcafing, grateful
and consoling circumstances to a certain
set of politicians, that could possibly have
occurred at this junflure. Under tlic
guise of ineafurps to affeit and support the
rights, dignity and independence of the U
nited States, the most deadly ftrnkes ar.e
aimed at the existence of the Constitution
âthe creditâthe union, and the internal
peace of the Country. Measures of real
energy in coiijundtion with those which
common sense, and common prudence
would didlate, and which the sober reflec*
tions of every ieal Republican must ap
prove, meet the rnoft pointed and invete
rate opposition. The truÂ« meaning of
tins condud is* âthat except internal con
vulsions should fuccetd the years of peace
and prosperity which we have enjoyed un
der the auspices of the genferaj govern
ment, another opportunity for fpecate
tion will be foreclofedâand the people
will continue to think, that those who
have been perpetually telling them that
they are governed by rogues and villains^
Congress of the United States.
House of Reprefentativas
Substance of the remarks made by Mr.
Giles on Mr. Dayton's resolution for
the fequeft ration of all debts due to
the British fubjedts.
( Concluded.)
Mr. Giles fai'd, he knew nothing of the
change of the minijtryâthe principle was
unknown here. The people here were
their own governors. It was immaterial
to them, who the minister was. Even in
the coun try where the people were lefa
fortunate;where ministers govern:a change
of ministers never produced any solid ad
vantage to the nationâlt was iriefefy an
expedient of the moment to imother a po
pular clamor. But even proceeding upon
the gentleman's hypothecs, whifh Mr.
G. thought wholly inadmilEble, whether
a passive submission by foreigner to the a
â vancious regulations of a minister, be the
most likely mean to render him unpopular
at home IâOn the other hand, whether
if was not the most effectual mean of pre
serving his popularity and of keeping him
in office ? He prefumcd the people at
home, would never complain of injuries
abroad, if those who sustained them refuf
-63 to complain. It is but by resistance
and throwing the burthen upon the peo
ple orf England tliat they can be brought
to complain.
But in cases of such extremities as the
present all appeals to the people of Eng
land are futile and degrading. Our only
rcfource Jbould be in our own exert'wns.
They would be abundantly fufficient if
we could be brought to believe it.
Mr. G. remarked, that the people ol
Ireland had lately afforded an inftrudtive
leflbn upon this point. They had arms
in their hands for the purpose of asserting
their rights; under th,e idea of acquies
cence and submission, they had surren
dered them to the government; perhaps
under the expectation of a change of mi
nistry. Did this ait of submission ren
a
V" vder them mere refpe&ah'.e in the cyis of e
the people of England ? did it encourage t
the hopes of those who wished the t'fta i
blilhment of government upon the prim
ciple of equal rights ? did it render the
people of Ireland mure rejpettablc in the
eyes of the people of thj United States ?
To these qiielticins it was unnecefTary to
give an anivver. The people of lieland
reaped the usual fruits of- lubmilfionâin
fult and impositions.
There was another consideration ftrong
lv in favor of the policy of the proposed
measure : Applications have already
made from different paits of the United
States by the immediate lufferers from
' the British depredations, for an indemni
fication of their lodes. These applica
tions will probably be increased, repeated,
and continued ; t he agricultural and other
interests of the United States will proba
bly never consent to equalize this burthen.
The claim of the fufferers upon the gov
ernment, will gain additional weight, un
less this fund lhould be offered to them
for their indemnification. This is the ob
vious, the natural, and the rightful fund
for their indemnification, and he thought
it was at least the duty of the government
-so hold it as a pledge for their security.â
If this measure lhould not now be adopt
ed, the refufal will lay a foundation for
further parties in the UmtedStates; which
may ultimately have a fen'ous effect upon
the government.
An objection of a very delicate and in
fluential nature, has been made to the
proposed measure, which required some
cOnfirieratian. That it would affect the
ch:: rafter and credit of the government.
He had viewed this objection with the
m.ift deliberate and felt the
whole force of its impoling delicacy ; but
was at length, perfectly fatisfied that it
was unfounded. This objection relates
rather to the right, than the polity of the
United States to adopt the measure. If
the United States polt'efs the right of re
prisal upon an honest and found interpre
tation of the laws'of nations; if the con
duit of Great Britain towards the Uni
ted States be fufficient to juftify the exer
cise of the rightâhe beleived the policy
of exercising the right could never tarnish
the American character nor lefTen the cre
dit of American citizens hereafter. The
world of nati.'ns as well as individuals tfill
easily fee, that it was a measure Of com
puifion not of choice; that alt-hough the
United States believed, they regretted the
necessity ; that they were not the authors'
o'~the original wrongs; that they "had borne
them with the greatest patience; that they
had used their endeavors to prevent the
commission of them ; and tlrat when these
wrongs were commmittcd and repeated,
the United Stares pofTeffed no other means
of redress.
Under these circumstances, from the
exercise of a substantial right, he did not
believe there could flow any consequential
wrong.
The motive would be looked at, and it
would furnifha compleate exoneration from
blame, whilst the original aggressors would
become justly responsible for all the confe
cucnc'a.
Mr. G. said he could not fit down with
out making some remarks upon the fruits
of the conduit heretofore observed by the
U. S. The most pacific system has here
tofore marked the character of the govern
mentâall America looked upon the late
proclamation of neutrality, as a competent
guarantee for peace. He had 110 doubt
but that it was dictated by the purest re
gard for peaee. But what have been
the fruits of it ? He did not mean to con
demn the conduct of the executive. Per
haps it was suggested by the then existing
state of things. He only intended to
(how that it had not met with the return
it merited, and which was reasonably ex
pected from it.
It has not producedpeace.âA regard for
peace has been construed into a fear of
â¢wqr. A resistance of the feelings of the
people for the cause of France, has been a
palatable food for British arrogance and
preemption. Submifiion to agreflibn has
invited new aggressions; appeals for justice
have been deemed testimonies of debility ;
till at length the U. S. after having been
ft ripped of their citizens and property are
upon the eve of a war, becmife they have
not exerted their rights at an earlier period.
If this conduit lhould have been hereto
fore wife and pacific,'experience has taught
us that it is no longer so ; nothing can be
expected from the justice, the honor, or
the moderation of a court, which haspror
' V 55
eikitfelf equally a ftraflger to tKem allâ
but before such a tribunal ajquiefeence 1
; will beget injuries,, injuries will beget in
uhs, and insults will beget contempt, de
gradation and war.

Thursday, April 10.
Mr. Clark's propoftiion for Jlvppi'ig ,e
commercial inlercourfe between the Uni
ted States and Great Britain under con
sideration of the Committee of the whole
âMr. Sherburne in the chair.
Mr. Sedgwick said he was sorry to rife
unprepared as he was âas he had yefter
d?y occupied as great a portion of the
time of the committee as perhaps he was
entitled to. He had hoped some other
gentleman would have rifeii who having
better arranged his ideas than myfelf, had
a preferable claim to the attention of the
committee; unprepared as he was, he
could not permit a question so important
as. that under consideration to pass with
out entering against it his solemn protest
âa question involving the dearelt inte
rests of our country, and threatening to
exchange the unexampled proiperity it
had for some years enjoyed, for all the
horrors of war.
He said he the more regretted the part
he was obliged to take 011 this eccafion be
cause he feared he lhould in his v*;te di
vide from many gentlemen whom he much
refpefted ; but as his opinion had been
formed on mature delitfferation, neither
his honor, his conscience or the duty he
owed to his country would permit him to
be fifctit. If the evils he forefaW lhould
result from the measure under coi.fidcra
tion, he wilhed it might be known that
no part of them could with justice be im
puted to him as their author. If there
fore, he should be so unfortunate as to '
stand single,. and alone, h*would not fail
to oppose as far as he could, the measure
before the committee.
That injuries unprovoked and inexcuf
ablc had been infii&cd by Great Britain
on this country, was acknowledged by all.
No man ftflt stronger indignation than
himfelf at the insults which had been of
fered to our country âand the wrongs
which had been done to our citizensâno
man was lei's disposed tamely to bear the
haughty and unprovoked aggreftions of
any foreign nationâno man would go
further to procure redress for our wound
ed honor- and indemnification for our in
jured citizensâlf after seeking repara
tion in the way dictated by prudence and
and humanity, happily prescribed by the
modern usages of civilized nations, and
commanded hy the principle of religion.
If fair negociation lhould be tried, and
justice not obtained, he would then seek
redress by the means which God and na
ture had given us.
He remembered well the miseries and
vices of warâa war in which he had taken
a part. It was a war of honor and inte
relt ; he well remembered its cirumllances
and effects. He had lived to fee the
wastes of that. war repairedâto fee a
state of order and securityâto fee his
country progrefling in all the means of
happinessâNo man who loved his coun
try and rejoiced in its prosperity, would
consent but from inevitable nfceflity to fee
it again plunged in the horrors of war.
Although all combined in opinion that
our injuries were greatâthat they must
be redrelfed, yet no one had suggested
that war should precede negociation ; re
fpeiting this there was happily but one
opinion ; on every fide of the house it
was acknowledged a duty indifpenfible in
our present situation to state our com
plaints of injuries to the authors of them,
and to demand redress. We were only
divided as to the manner of our applica
tion, and the circumftnnces under which'
our demand should be made.
He had already on another occasion ta
ken the liberty to declare his opinion of
the line of conduit which was dictated by
our present situation ; that we should ma
nifeft that we were averse from war ; .but
should it become inevitable, we would en
counter it with that undaunted: fpii it
which became freemen, insulted in their
honor and injured in their rights. He
had the most perfect confidence in the
bravery of our citizens. At the fame
time that he knew they would never sur
render their rights, he was sensible that
they would avoid if poflible an urinccef
fary and wanton effufion of blood.
9 \. ' r- % Â» '
Gentlemen bed disclaimed t.n iBUr. t:cn
to adopt any any mezlures tending to war;
they had said this meafiire had no ten
dency to iuch an event. I his allertion
he could not believe, because.this measure
contained a threat of inconvenience ; and
every threat of inconvenience; was a cause
of irritation, and every irritation between
nations who had already differences to de
cide undoubtedly tended to widen the
breach and of course to produce war.
If gentlemen were iincere in their de
clarations, that all differences between
America and Gieat Britain Ihould be
terminated by peaceable negociation and
he would not call their fmcerity in ques
tion. If Great Britain was proud,
haughty and insolent as the had been re-i
peatedly denominated, was it probable,
he alked, that (he would be more inclined
to do us justice, by inlilliqg her pride and
insolence against us ?
Mr. S. said that the late 'violences by
which the property of our citizens had been
plundered, was the immediate and avowed
cause of the prcLnt measure. That as yet no
reprefentatiryi of these injuriesâno demand
for compensation had b en madeâThat such
representation and demand ihou'd precede
hostility was conceded by ail. It only, then,
remained to be considered in what terms and
manner such claim ihould be exhibited ? In
terms, he said, doubtless firm and decided,
hut if it was intended to produce the desired
cffeil, of peace, and to prevent .hostility the
language ihould be decent and ccnc.liaiory.
He called on gentlemen to ihew an instance
in modern times, where a nation complain
ing of injuries but desirous of peace, had ac
companied their demands of juft.ee with
threats of inconvenience ! The opposite prac
tice was universally eitabliihed and on the
known principles of human nature. He ap
pealed to the feelings of every honorable
man in the committee, whether demands for
justice and reparation for injuries were en
forced by threats ! Whether repugnance to
a compliance with fach demands was not
created by ftich means ? If every man felt
the operation of this principle, iiow much
more powerful would it be on the minds of
the Governors of a naoon, lined proud and
insolent ?
He said he would charge no man with an
intention to involve this country in all the
horrors, and defoiatiug scenes of war. He
could not hpvvever help declaring, that war
or amicable negociation evidently mull decide
the controverlies between America and Great
Britain, and that was his mind determined
on the former, he Ihould recommend rhofe
nicafures which gentlemen had brought for
ward to the confederation of the houfc, as
the molt operative means of rendering the I
, event certain, and of baniihing every prof
pett of accommodation. To leize on Bri
tilh property, to confifcate qr lcquefter Bn
tifh debts, to annihilate as far as in our pow
er her commerce; to itarve her manufac
tures, and to humbie her prideâthese were
infallible means of defeating negotiation, and
of uniting as one man, that natuon-againft us
in all the views ci" her adminiftraiion.
It had been laid, that a principal benefit
to be expected from the inllicu.ion of repub
lican government was, that cool and temper
ate reflection wouid direct the conduit of
nations. How far our conduit on this occa
lion had verified such an expectation, he
wiihed gentlemen to reflect. He had hiiti
felf fondly hoped in the government of this
country, to have leen thelc principles exem
plified, and all intemperance 6Â£..'cxpr>:lhon,
and all the heat of paiiion baniihed. It had
been said, that a statesman ihould be all intel
lect ; never i'urely was a time or country
which more required, than the pjefent time
and this country, the exoiciie of cool tem
per, to the exclusion of passion, to conduift
with fafety the political machine thro' sur
rounding dangers.
He well remembered a former non-impor
tation agreement, he remembered too its ef
fectsâthey were such as might have- been
expedtedâthey were such as to convince
every cool and conhderate man that the mea
sure itlelf was impolitic and unwise. It im
mediately raised the price of all articles of
importation to an exorbitant and extravagant,
height. Hence it was immediately beneficial
to importers and fhcpktepers, and hence it
may be easy to understand why this rrui lore
was said to be so popular in Philadelphia and
other great towns. But as the reprel'enta-'
tives of the whole people of America, the
Legislature ought to reflect that in pro
portion as this measure would operate bene
fit to the dealers in imported commodities,
it would become burdenfbme and opprefiive
to those who are best entitled to our regard,
? the fubfiantial yeomanry of the Country, on
whom we mult principally depend for sup
port in the arduous conflict which we had
too much realon to apprehend. If we must
eventually support our claims by arms the
more property we could import before the
commencement of war, the more beneficial
would it be. In that cafe the m oft wife and
prudent policy would be that, which would
give the greatest extent to our cretiit; and
on the contrary, the mod unwise and wretch
ed, that which would tend to deprive our
people of the ordinary means of supplies.

Without entering int* a minute detail, he
said, he would pronounce that
a great part of it would perish or. our
hands.
It was he said, doubtful how far at any
time the proposed system might go to dif- '
tress Great Britain ; but at this time it
would alToril facility to her in recruiting
her fleets and armies; were manufacturers
and laborers thrown out of employment,
and thereby deprived of bread, they would
be alike stimulated by want and despair,
to fight the battles,of their country against
those who had reduced them to neceflity.
In Ihort, he saw nothing which fnouid
stimulate the legislature to adopt this tnea
fure, but passion without, and resentment
within the walls. He saw nothing in the
system itfelt, as it refpe&ed Crent Bri
tain, but vain, and ineffectual irritation,
nothing in relation to our own country,
but defeat, wretchednefa and want.

of the Line and three frigates arrived at
Port-au-Prince from France,the 6th March,
having on board Mcflis. De Letombe,
Painiere, Le Roy and Pagefe, who are
lent out to replace Sonthonax & Polverel,
that M. Le Roy and Pagefe with a strong
escort are gone to Cayes to arrest Polve
rel. After securing Port-au-Prince, M.
Le Tombe (ailed with the fleet for Jere
mie, where he arrived the 12thMarch;
and surprized and took two Englifli fri
gates, and three privateers, which were
in the port; the EngHlh garrison were
made prisoners of war, and nearly all the
inhabitants are taken and embarked on
board the fleet, to be sent to France, to
render an account of their conduct. The
fame thing happened at Jeremie as at Tou
lon, one part of the people as soon as
they saw the fleet, turned their arms a
gainst t'i j other, and were the cause of a
feeble rcfiftance.

" Captain ArtguS arrived here this morn- I
intj from Guadaloupe, but last from Antigua,
where he was carricd into by a privateer,
but liberated in consequence of the last m
ftru<ft:on3.
" Captain Angus brought me a letter
from Capt. Willis, of nd March, by which
I find they had released his vefiel two days
before, he had fold his flour at 3-4 dollars,
one half rum, and the other half cafn, but
did not expect to obtain permillion to ftll
the lalt provisions at Antigua but would
probably go to St. Bartholomews, or St Mar
tins, to diipofe of his pork and beef, and lay
out his money in sugar."
1 Extra <5t of another letter dated Brandywine,
I 4th month, 14) 1784-
1 Â»We have the plealure to advise you,
that Capt. Angus has just arrived from Gua
daloupe, he was carried into Antigua, and
released underthe Uteinftruaions from Great
Britainâseveral veflels,all that were not con -
demned at Antigua were released, amongst
them was a schooner belonging to our neigh
bor, I. B. he has letters from Captain,
confirming the above account.
At a meeting of the Philadelphia Con

We, the fubferibers, declare, that we
left the Island of Dominica on Sunday
the 23d March. That at the time of our
departure*, there were thirty-five American
veflels condemned, all which condemna
tions took place previous to the arrival of
the second order from Gjeat Britain.â
That wheii the said fecoira oftfer did ar
rive, the Judge requirjri ofail owners and
agents of (hips of war and privateers to
give bonds for amount of the sales of t'hrofe
veflels and cargoes that had been condemn
ed, that the agents of the men of war
did give surety agreeably to ast of parlia
ment, but the agents,and owners of pri
vate vefiels refufed to comply that
they acted under authority of government,
and if they had given wrong inftruftions,
of course government must abide by the
consequences.
On the arrival of the second instruc
tions, the court had met from day to day
without doing business, but it was the
prevailing opinion of all clafles of people
there, that all those veflels taken under
the former instruCtions would be condemn
ed.â
And that after the investiture of Mar
tinique by Admiral Jervis, and no more
American veflels coming from Martinique,
all the small privateers, such as had for
merly been drogers, and unfit to cruize
at a distance, and such other veiTels as
were wanting to load home to Europe,
were called in ; it is to be understood,
that no orders weie iflued from the admi
ralty, or from any other authority, for
difinantling the private fliips or veflels of
war.

Copy of a letter from Capt. BARNEY,
to a Gentleman in Congress.
" Kingston, March 4th, 1794.
" Sir,
" I wrote you on the 2id, informing
you that the Britilh seemed determined
to ruin the Americans, &c. Since which
time a number of Americans have been
sent in, some of them directly from A
merica, loaded with lumber, who have
now a lawsuit to go through, the expen
ces of which will require the whole car
go of each to pay. Many of them are
obliged to abandon their veflels, having
neither money nor friends. Yoiir brig
John is libelled a a French prÂ«p-r>y, but
that is merely a form, to cover fouie other
reason. Mr. Is goi 'g to make a
elate), but was I in the lartw fituatwn,' 1
wouii abandon all, a tic) come home, be
in" well convinced all will be cot.J.Pnii*
ed.â â 
" Ycilerday 1 was to have been tried,
but the court have adjourned till the loth
init. They tantalize me with ''We have
" caught you at lafl,' and we will take
" ;Tood care you (hall take no more vet
" fels; we wish the others may foil into
" pur hands," &c. Now, Sir, I wish to
relate to vou a piece of the greatest im
pudence and insult I ever heard of: Yes
terday the American (hip MaffachVfetts,
Capt. White, arrived ; (he was taken on
her passage from Bourdeaux to New-York,
by the letter of marque (hip Jame's, Capt.
Wilkes. On her coming into port, Capt.
Wilkes ordered the British ensign to be
Lb'tjltd over the American enjign, in which
situation it remained all day. This insult I
to the nation ought not to be fuffeied.â
Satisfa&ion, by the puiiifhment of that
Captain, is the leait that can be demand
ed, and was it on our fide such an affront
had been given, the nation would have had
more ample fatisfaclion.
" I hope, fir, tho' that you and Mr.
do not agree, oil the British trade &c. I (nail
fee you among the firft to support the credit
of our flag, when insulted in such a manner.
If you were to be only four hours riere, you
would fee more into the deiigns of the British
than all the information that can be sent to
you by letter; reft allured of this serious
fz'A, the more you humble the inoreyou may;
th:y are determined, and you have nothing
i lore'to do, than instantly prepare to meet
them: Now is your time; (too your piovi
fions and lumber, and they will soon render
you juilice, but let me beg of you to embar
go the American vefi'els, iu order to keep
vour seamen, or the British will have them
all." I am &.c.

Mr. Fenno,
Please to give the following a place in

A Friend.
I OBSERVED in Mr. Baehe's paper, a
long firing of Resolutions published by the
Democratic Society. A Society which I had
for some time contemplated to join, suppos
ing that good might result therefrom, but
" npijl observing that the tendency aÂ»d design
I op those resolutions is evidently to inflame
i the minds of msny of the citizens of the li
nked States, and viewing them as held up as
a Rod to awe the government of my coun
try, and that Congress may be driven there
by into a premature war with fevefal of the
powers of Europe ; lam brought to a pause
at this moment, and shall omit joining the
society, and shall continue to stand aloof un
til I am convinced that they do not mean to
ait as Dictators, yours,
