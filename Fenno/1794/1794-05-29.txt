At a general meeting of the owners,

That on or about the third day of Fc-

on or about the fifth day of February,

âthe following day officers were sent on

unbent, our colours torn down, ourselves
with oi(r mates and seamen "were taken
I out of our vefTels without being permitted
j to take a Tingle change of clothes, fecuie
| our cabins or trunks, and were carried 011
j board afhipof war; and after undergo
ing a contemptuous examination', were
coWviyed on board a prison-ship ; hei'ewe
were crouded together to the number of
two hundred and fifty persons, in a fmail'
iliip with afr.igle deck, without any kind
of provisions except what we received
from our friends on ifjore., and even that
with great difficulty, as they forbid' any
boat coming along fide the fiiip. "We re
mamed in this situation three days ; dur
ing which time we made applications to
the commodore, Capt. Nugent, of the
ship of war called the Veteran, and beg
ged he would supply us with provisions,
or at leali let iis go on shore to provide it
for ourselves, and we received this laconic
replyâ7 hat he should give us nothing
"that we were a set of damn'd rascals, and
might ftarvfc and be damn'd. That at
length, a commissary was appointed to Tup
pi)* the seamen with provisions, and we
were permitted to go on shore and live at
our own expense; some of us w.:re per
mitted to go on board our vefTels, to look
after our trunks, bedding, clothes, &c.
and found that our cabins had been fhame
fully plundered, our trunks and chests
broke open and robbed of every thing of
value, our papers, that were of
to any person but ourselves, torn and des
troyed ; and, in fact, a line of depreda
tions exhibited that could have been only
produced through the effects of malici
ous revenge and th* frenzy of intoxica
tion.
Our vessels were moored together so
close, that in fifteen days many of them
chaffed through and funk; some drifted
to sea and never returned; others drove 011
shore and bilged; our unfortunate seamen
who were unable to live on shore, or their
captains to support them, died daily on
board the prtfon fliip; some were seized
and put on board the (hips of war. That
after more than a month's fufpence, we
were informed a court of vice-admiralty
was eflabliihed to try us (or rather to
condemn us) and we were monitioned to
appear and anfwe.- to the libel; almost as
soon as we heard the court appointed,
when our preparatory examinations ought
to have preceeded its issuing, which con
vinced us that as the judge had commenc- '
ed illegally, we could cxpeft nojufticc from
him : that another month had almost elap

SNUFF and SUGAR TAX.
It is itbfuid to fay that home manufac
tures are improper fubjedts of taxation ;
such a dodtrine would, under certain cir
cumstances, destroy all revenue, and leave
the government destitute of any resource
but land tax, which ofjtfelf operates in
a great degree as a tax on home manu
factures.
If the revenues (>f a country be chiefly
-derived' from import, and the effect of
;hat impoll be, by protedting duties, to
fubrtitute domestic for foreign manufac
tures, the revenue is loft on the articles not
imported, and mult be supplied, either
by a laud-tax or by a tax on the home
made article. For instance, imported loaf
sugar and fnujf, were dutied so high as to
micouiage the home manufacture of those
articles ; they are now no longer import
ed but in small quantities, the revenue
once derived from them is consequently
Igil ; but that revenue being pledged foi
the iupport of government, and the pub
lic credit, a fubrtitute mult be refbrted
to ; now what better fubrtitute can there
be than those very articles furnifhed by a
domestic manufacture, foftered and teared
to maturity by the very duties which their
pcrtedion has annihilated. If this be
not done, those articles will altogether
escape taxation, and surely there are none
more fit for it. Shall fait be tÂ»xcd, and
has sugar and fmjf go free > The one a
species of luxury, the other not only a
luxury, but an idle fuperfluity ! If ever
there were two articles proper for revenue,
these are the two, and the mode adopfed,
is the only one whereby the articles are
ccmeatnble.
All the noise then made on this fubjedt
resolves itfelf into this, that fnuff and
loaf sugar ought to pay no tax.
Infant mnnufadtures ought certainly to
be protested, and no government has
done more for them than that of the Uni
ted States. The manufactures of fnuff
and sugar have experienced the benefits
of that protection, and have grown to
such importance, that they not only sup
ply all the United States, but furnifli a
fu, plus for exportation. Of fnuff a con
siderable quantity is exported. Shall the
opulent manufacturers be exempt from
their fhate of the public burdens, while
the merchant and shopkeeper groan un
der the prefTureof continually increasing
duties > Ought they not to furnifh their
mite to the support of a government un
derwhich they have grown wealthy?
Will the sugar-baker begrudg# a trifle
from his immense earnings to sweeten the
sorrows of his wretched fellow-citizens
at Algiers ? Will the fnuff-manufadurer
suppose the defence of our country not
worth a finch of fnujf>
Fie on such opposition ; if these gen
tlemen are composed of such fymtathhing
materials, let them sympathize with their
miserable fellow-men at Algiers, and not
deprive Congress of the means of deliver
ing them, or rob the consumers ef War
ana fnuff of the gratification of contribu
ting to tKeir relief.
Where is the truly patriot-citizen who
will not find his sugar the more palatable
when he refiedh that it tends to sweeten
the poor captives' woes ? Or who will not

Jlobefpierreâ" The execrable faction
who vÂ»oiild enslave us, and whose plots
have been discovered, has assembled at
i aris, bands of emigrants, and of despe
rate men of all deicriptions. With the
aid of these monsters, crimes have been
planned, the idea aloue of which makes
one shudder, and of which the annals of
'.he world afford no example. All the
tyrants ot Europe were well acquainted
with the exaÂ£t time at which this incredi
ble tragedy was to have commenced. To
force the prisons, to cut the throat of a
part of the prisoners, to arm the reft, to
fall on the National Reorefentation and
murder them, to do. the fame by the
Constituted authorities, and all the firmed
fujiporters of the Republic; to obtain by
this means, the poffeflion of all the pow

Temple of Liberty to re-establish Royal

who had contrived to insinuate themselves
into the confidence of the people. With
regard to the proofs of these accumulated
ci imes, we have them in abundance.
These proofs {hall be laid before you.
But, before all things, I adjure the peo

enemies; I adjure them to defend the sa
cred cause of Liberty with their accustom

support their R'epreientatives, who will
always condud themselves with the fidelity
proportioned to the confidence reposed in
them. I entreat the people to go through

the accomplices of the criminals whom
we have already in our poffeflion, and to

VALENCIENNES, March 16.
A few days ago the French, to the
number of 3000, with four pieces of can
non, arrived at the village of Youi, on the
causeway between Bouchain and Carabray,
which they immediately began to pillage.
The whole village would have been sacked,
but for a detachment of about So Auftn
an hussars, who making their appearance
before the village, led the Carmagnols to
fnppofe that a strong corps was appi oach
ing to dislodge them, and Caused them to
retreat, carrying with them 50 -waggons,
loaded with their spoils. The day before
yelterday the republicans returned, 6000
men strong, and accompliihed the ruin of
that ill-fated viilaj^.
The head-qnarters of the Prince of Co
bourg are still here, and nofNvithftanding
<he contrary reports, which have been in
circulation these last days, it is not likely
that any great movement will happen in
our army before the 25th of this month.
FRANKFORT, March 6.
The difference between the courts of
Vienna and Berlin, with respect to the
most proper means for the defence of the
I Empire, against the invasion of French
1 troops, is of such a natui e as is likely to
produce a great change either in the future
conduit of the war, or perhaps in the ge
neral position of affairs with refpeft to
France. The probability of this becomes
greater, not only from the arrival of French
comtnifiioners in this city, and from the
manner in which they are received by the
Prussian general, the count de Kalkreuth,
but from their continuing to reside here,
and from the pacific tone which is affumid
by all those who belong to the court of
Berlin, and the writers in their intetelL
MANHEIM, March 11.
Deserters just arrived from NenhorfF,

habitants robbed of every thing they pof
fefTed.
1 he night before last a great body of
French cavalry appeared before- Rhcrn
gemheim, and forced the Austrian advan
ced poll, after a day's bloody skirmish. *
The Carmagnols however did not succeed
in their object to plunder the country, but
were obliged to fend back their waggons
empty, which they had brought with than
to carry off the spoils.
Last night the French, in very conside
r j fÂ° rce > l attempted to carry off the ports
of Mundenheim, Oggerfheim, and Friez
heim. Ihe post of Oggerfheim was taken,
the other poll fell back, as did two more,
to the fort of the Rhine ; the French pur
sued as far as within reach of the cannon
of the son. The reserve of the garrison
ot Manheim were ordered to mar t i. to the
fort of the Rhine, which movement they
effe&ed with much celerity ; at 11 o'clock

Opening of the New Drury-Lane Theptrci
The firft performance in this magnift.
cent ftru&ure commauded, as might have
been cxpe&ed, a numerous aad brilliant
audience. The general appearance of the
house, combining solidity with lightness
and elegance with fimplietty, is, in every
refpeft honorable to the taste and fkili of
the archited. We mult add also, though
it may be deemed an inferior praise, that
the entrances are moll happily disposed
for the cjlftribution of the audience, and
are at the fame time of such amplitude,
that no poflible croud can give iirth to
danger or even to in'convgn/'ence.
It opened with a grand selection from
the works of Handel. The ttage was
formed on this occasion, to represent the
inside of a Gothic Cathedral ; and the
coup d'oeil was such, on the riling of
the curtain, as to draw forth the appro
bation of the audience, exprefled not in
the customary manner, but in loud huz

The merits of the performers, and the

In corroboration of what is dated in

With refpeft to the disposition of the court
or Berlin, we extract the following articles
from a Prussian paper:â
" Notwithftnnding the extraordinary
preparations which are making, in all quar

have received particular intelligence, which
gives us reason still to entertain fomehope
of an accomodation tak ng place, or at lead

General Aberci omby narrowly escaped

of the troops of Poland, and offers very
advantageous terms to the difbauded offi

Way to get rid of an army that might yet
give her trouble, and to add the greater
part of it to her own forces.
1 he fats of Poland, even amidst the ge
neral diltrefs of Europe, cannot fail of
claiming a sigh of pity, or awakening an
emotion of indignation, in every generous

The land-owners and farmers are now the
order of the day, and are about to un

attributed the present scarcity to the ava

he) (hould the country people refufe us

loudly applauded ; and we have no doubt,

The French have experienced very

which Mr. Whitlock has very deserVedly

such a character as Mrs. Whitlock attracted

Mr. Green has improved so much, and

The Observer would hint, with cantion,

PHILADELPHIA,
, By this Day's Mail.
BRUSSELS, March 16.
The French, it is positively aflerted, have
agreed to give a large sum of money to the
King of P , part of which has airea--y'
pa(Ted their frontier, in confldrration where
of, his P- 11 Majeity, who, it is ("aid,
does not consider himfelf immediately inter
red in the war, signs with them a treaty of
peace and alliance.
The two French commi.Tioners at Frayk
fort are to put a finishing hand to this buii
neft.
The demand made by his Pnlffian Maicfty
for bread and forage, to so large an amount,
is estimated at 20 millions of florins. The
Emperor has offered tii pay the half, which
has been refufed, because he owes the King
of Prussia already jo millions, fiirnnbed him
duryag theprelent war, the payment of which
is now required, The King of PruiTia, in
stead of diminifliing his demand upon the
Circles, in consequence of the difficulties it
has met with lias augmented it. He now
demands, that they (hall ailCo make good to
him 260 German florins for e vV'ly mad. that
â Slav be killed during l .') - war.
There is another report equat.'fy iippor
tant, and which, if equally true, tiVvelopes
the views of the King of Prussia. is Jaid
that his troops having been admitted rnto
that part of Silesia flill remaining to Au
stria.have seised several posts of importance
and particularly the paflages in the Car
pathian mountains, which separate that
country from the vther Hates of the house
of Austria. ,
In short, some believe that bis design is
to poflefs himfelf of the remainder of Si
lesia, which formerly belonged to his fa
mily, as an indemnity, for the money lent
the Emperor.
OSTEND, April i.
No action of consequence has yet happen
ed, tho' there is much lkirmifhing towards
Bouchainand I.e,Careauj; and from present
circumstances, k appears probable, that a
general engagement, in that neighbourhood
will soon take place. The head quarters of
the Britilh army are removed to St. Amand.
Tournay is almost wholly evacuated, the
troops being moved, & formed to cover the
Auftrians upon the frontiers. The Commis
sary General's station is now at Antwerp,
whither all the (lores are now removing.
The defection of the King of Prulliafrom
the alliance is now generally believed j tho'
the Gerrnas papers in general afiecfk to dis
credit itâthe following avowal has appeared
in the Gazette de Cologne, under the date
of Mayence, March 13.
" His Majesty the Kiug of Prussia hav
ing ordered that none of his troops Ihould re

yond his subsidiary corps of 20,000 men, the
Pruflians begin to leave us. This day, pas

" The extraordinary urgency of the

this letter to your Highness, in full a flu
ranee of your Highsefs's perfect know

th<i Six Frontier Circles to enter them
with fire and sword ; such a crisis is too
well known to your Excellent*-, not to
fee the necefliiy of concurring with me,
and vfi'.h eyery State animated with a pa
triotic zeal in the mull proper mcafures
to ward off the danger.
Among all the measures which the
Empire can employ, there is, none which
appears to me mure inefficacious against
an enemy, whose numbers diunnifti not,
and who oppose a frantic fury in battle,
to the resources of tactics, and a nume
rous artillery ; nothing, I fay, is more
insufficient than the general armament of
the inhabitanta'of the Circles, which has
been proposed. This meaftire, "so dan
gerous, and so Angularly delitate in it
felf," is (till more inadmiflible, because
il can in no wife accord with the defence
of the empire by my trot>ps, and their re
treat mud infallably be the confequente.
A$ it is impoifible for me to continue
a war so far diilant from the frontieis of
my ettatesj and which is so expensive, 1
have* foijie months iince, frankly opened
myf-if on this head to the principal pow
ers who take part m the war, and 1 have
entered on negotiations with them, which
cannot yet be terminated.
It ,is for this reason now 1 find myfclf
obligrd to demand of the Empire, to
charge itfelf with the provisioning of my
army,
In.reality, the necefiaiy mtafuiga on this
fujajeft have beeh lately made at.the Diet,
but jmj'r Highness will consider, that it is
impoflible to wat its decision r so that the
orJ-y thing which remains to be done fat
the Si? Frontier Circles, who have moil
â Â»eed of defence,is to assemble immediately
for the purpose of furnifhilig the said pro
visions provifionaHy, until, the Diet has
made its concluficin. >
In conference, I beg of your High
ness, iq the moll pressing manner that your
Highness, in virtue of your quality of
Arch-Chancellor and Director of the Cir
cles would immediately convoka the said
Six Circles.
The speedy convocation of the Six Cir
cles and their furnirfiing my army with
provisions, is the only means of saving Ger
many at the grand crisis. Without this,
it will be .impoflible for me to make my
troops maintain the field any longer againit
the enemy. I (hall not fail, though with
regret, to order them back into my dates,
for their own defence, and to abandon the
Empire to itfelf and to its fate.
It Is in the hands, therefore, of your
Highness that I put the fafety of the Em
pire ; and confident of your wisdom. and
patriotism, I expedl you will employ the
.means which the laws of the Empire give
y,.)-u in such a manner, that nfiy views, di
reistÂ£"l to the good of the country, may be
fulfilled, and that, by ray troops being fup
pfied. witfr provisions, I may be able to as

The Public are cautioned to
beware of counterfeited Five Dollar Bills of
the Bank of the United States, and Twenty
Dollar Bills of the Bank of North America,
several of which have appeared in circulation
within a few days pajl; they are a good ge
neral imitation of the genuine Bills, hut may
he dj/lihgui/hcd by the following
MARKS.
Five Dollar Bills of tb; Batik of the
United. States*
ALL that have appeared have the letter F.
for their Alphabetical Mark.
The Texture of the Paper is thicker and
whiter and it takes the ink more freely than
the genuine paper.
The O. in the word Company is smaller
than the M* and other letters of that word,
so that a line extended from the top of the O,
to touch the top of thÂ£ M. would extend con
(iderably above the range of whole word.
In the word United the letters are narrow
erand closer together than th# reft of the bill
The i and fin the word promise are not
parallel, the yinclining much more forward
than the i.
The engraving is badly executed,the (hokes
ot all the Letters are stronger and the devi e
in themargin particularly ismuch coarfcr and
appears darker than in the true bills. Some
of the counterfeits bear date in 1791 âWhere-
as the Bank was not in operation till Decern
ber, and no five dollar bills were ifTued in
ihat year.
Twenty Dollar Bills of the Bank ofjNorth
America.
ALL that have appeared have the letter
B tor their alphabetical mark.
They are printed on a paper nearly similar
to that of the couuterfeit Five Dollar Notes
above dcfcribed ; the engraving is bettei exe
ucted, and they approach nearer to the ap
pearance of the genuine hills.
The fine ruled lines through the word Ttccn
t\ 9 in the body of ihe bill, are lnnumhei th r
teen in the genuine b<lis, and but twelve in
the counterfeits.
The word Company is much like the fame
word in the Five Dollar B Hs as defer ibed a
bove, the 0 being lels than the m t and others
folio wing.
There is no stroke to the t in the word North
whereas in the genuine bills the stroke is, well
defined.
The letters ent in the word Tuienty y to the
left hand at the bottom, do not.Come down to
the line, but are so cut as to give an irregular
appearance to the word, the Ttu and go
ing below them.
The lignature J Nixon, has the appear
ance of being written with lamb-black and
01, and ditiers h:mi aÂ»her inks uCtrO in
printing the bills and the oalhicr's' iiguature.
It is fuppoied these forge;ics were committed
in some of ths Southern States, as all the coun
terfeits thai have appeared, have come from
theocc, and two persons have been apprehend
ed in Virgima ( cyi suspicion of being ihe author
of them.
The reward CTTF. THOUSAND trait, /tKS
will be paid to any Peifon or P< Â«sons who {haN
difeover and prdfecute to convidt oir the several
offenders of the following defniptions or any
of them, viz.
The person or pcrfons, who manufa&ured
the paper on which the Bills are printed.
The person or persons, who -engraved the
plates.
The printer or printers, of the bills,
fcvciy person who has a&ed as a principal in
any othci way, in the counterfeiting and utter
ing the said bills.
Philadelphia, Match 28, 1794
April 22, 1794,
Other counterfeit bills
of the Bank of the United States have appeared
ill circulation.
The denomination is of TWENTY DOL
LARS,and the alphabetical maik is the let
ter B.
1 hey may be diflinguiftied from the genu
ine by the following MARKS :
The paper of ihe counterfeit? is of a more
tender texture atÂ«j gloil'ey fmface than the
genuine, and. there is no water mark in them.
Tlie letter C. in the word Caihier, in the
true bills is strongly marked, whereas in the
counterfeits, ihe whole letter is a fine hair
itroke, evidently in an uiifinifhed state. The
letter a in the word demand, is badly formed
and tiie whole -word ill dohe, and there is no
comma at the end of it, as there is~in the
genuine bills.
, 'marginal device, is much darker in
1e â Â» t ' ,an " le genuine bills owing to
t e fliade flrokes being coarser, much nearer
ogether, and conlequently much morp nu
merous. This difference strikes the eye at firft
view. J
nnr h r I 3 rcward of ONE THOUSAND
LARS, will be paid for apprehending, ic
profecucing to convi&ion the several above
âºw' ( ? ffcnders i" 'efpeft to this, as to
the laftdefcribed bills.
