fit ioMmtUce cf the n boU on Mr, ftfiulifons
rtjtAutions.
Mr. A m es (poke ax follows
Tiie qucftion lies within this eompafi,
Is there any mejfure proper to be adoptid
by Cungrtls, which will have the effect to
put our trade and navigation on a better
footing ? If there is, it is our undoubted
right to adopt it; if by right is Â»nder
ltood the power of felf-governrr.ent which
every independent nation pofleffet, and our
own as completely as any other. It is
our duty alio, for we are the depolitories
and the guardians of the intereils of our
confJtucnts, which on every confidera
tiori ought to be dear to us. I make no
<t they are so, and that there is adif-
fufficicntly ardent exiiting in this
body to co-operate in any meaiures for
for the advancement of the common good.
Indeed io fai a; I can judge fiom any know
ledge I have of human nature or ol the
prevailing spirit of public tranlaftions,
that fort of patriotism, which makes us
w!(h the general profptrity when our pri
vate inurjft dees not happen to (land la the
way, is no uncommon sentiment.- In
tiu'.h, it is very like felf-love and net
leis mucli prevalent. There is little occa
sion to excite and inflame it. It is like
lt!f-love, more apt to want intelligence
than zeal. The danger is always that it
will refh blindly into embarrafiments,
which a pnrdent spirit of enquiry might
have prevented, but from which it will
icarcely find means to extricate us. While
therefore, the right, the duty, and the
inclination to advance the trade and navi
gation of the United States, are acknow
ledged and felt by us allâthe choice of
the proper means to that end, is a matter
requiring the molt ciYcv.mfpeit enquiry,
and the rnoft dilpallicnate judgment.
After a debate has continued a long
time, the fubjeit very frequently becomes
tirefeme befoie it is exhauftid. Argu
ments, however solid, urged by different
speakers can scarcely fail to render the
clifcuflion both cothpiex and diffufiveâ
without pretending to give to rr.y r.rgu
ments any other merit, I frail aim at
fimplioity.
We hear it declared, that the design of
the refutations is to place our trade and
navjgation on a better footing. Bv a
better footing, we are to understand a
more profitable one. Profit is a plain
v ortl that cannot be mifrepreftnted.â
We have, to speak in round numbers)
twenty millions dollars of exports annual
ly. To have the trade ]of export on a
good footing, meant nothing more than
to fell them dearâand conlcquently the
trade of impoit on a good footing, is to
buy cheap. To put them both on a bet
ter footing, is to fell dearer and to buy
cheaper than we do at present. If the
effect of the resolutions will be tt> cause
our exports to be fold cheaper, and our
imports to be bought dearer, our trade
v. ill fuffer an injury.
It is hard to compute how great the
injury would prove : for the firft loss of
value in the buying dear, and felling cheap,
is only the symptom and beginning of
the evil, but by no means the measure of
itâlt will withdraw a great part of the
nouriflnnent that now supplies the wonder
fnl growth of our industry and opulence.
The difference may not amount to a great
proportion of the pi ice of the articles, but
it may reach the greater part of the pro
fit of the producerâlt may have efteÂ£ts
ill this way which will be of the word
kind, by difcoui aging the produfls of our
land and industry. It is to this test I
propose to bring the resolutions on the
table, and if it (liall clearly appear that
they tend to canfe our exports to be fold
cheaper, and our imports to be bought
dearer, they cannot escape condemnation.
V\ hatever specious shew of advantage may
be given them, they deserve to be called
aggravation* of any real or supposed evils
in our commercial system, and not reme
dies.
I have framed this flatement of the
qiieftion so as to comprehend the whole
fubjeet of debate, and at the fame time, I
confcfs it was my design to exclude from
conlideration, a number of topics which
â¢ppcar to me totally irrelative to it.
The best answer to many aflerti
onÂ» we have heard, is to admit them
without proof. We are exhorted to ifiert
our uatural rights, to put trade on a rcfpec
tjole iUt'.i.igi to dictate rtiirw of trade to
uther nations, to in a contctt of
feli'-den.sl, and by that, and by Ihiitiiig
our commerce from one country to ano
ther, to make our enemies feel the extent
of our power. This language, as it ref
ptctÂ» the proper fubjett of dilcullion, means
nothtng, or wiiat is worse. If our trade ig
already on a profitable footing, it is on a
respectable one. Unlcfs war he our object,
it is ufelels to enquire, what are the dil
politions of any government, with whose
lubjeds our merchants deal to the bell ad
vantage ! While they will smoke our to
bacco, and eat our proviiioi.s, it is very
immaterial, both to the consumer and the
producer, what are the politics of the two
countries, excepting so far as their quar
rels may dillraft the benefits of their mu
tual intercourse.
So far therefore as commerce is concern
ed, the enquiry is, have we a good market ?
The good or bad state of our etSual
market is the quellion. The a&ual mar
ket is every where more or less a reftrifted
one, and the natural order of things is
chlMaced by the artificialâMoll nations
so / rcafons of which they alone are the
rightful judges, have regulated and ref
t ricked tlieir intercotirfe, accoiding to their
views of fafety and profit. We claim for
ourlelves the fame right, as the acts in
our (latutc book, and the refolutione on
the table evince, without holding ourselves
accountable to any other nation whatever.
The right which we properly claim, and
which we properly exercise when we do
it prudently and ulefujly for our nation,
is as well ellablilhed, and has been longer
in life in the countries of which wc com
plain, than in our own. If their right is
as good as that of Congress, to regulate
and rcftric*, why do we talk of a strenuous
exertion of our force, and by dictating
terms to nations, who are fancied to be
phyfrcally dependenton America, tochange
the policy of nations ? It may be very
true, that their policy is very wife and
good for themselves, but not as favorable
for us as we could make it, if we could
Legislate for both fides of the Atlantic.
The extravagant despotism of this lan
guage accords very ill with our power to
give it c'ietl, or with the affectation of
zeal for an unlimited freedom of com
merce. Such a (late of absolute freedom
of commerce never did exist, and it is very
much to be doubted whether it ever will.
Were I inverted with the trust to legislate
for mankind, it is very probable the firft
ast of my authority would be to throw all
the reftriftive and prohibitory lawsof trade
into the fireâthe resolutions on the table
would not be spared. But if 1 were to
do so, it is probable I (hould have a quar
rel on my hands with everv civilized na
tion. The Dutch would claim the mono
poly of the spice trade, for which their
ancestors pasTed their whole lives in war
fare. The Spaniards and Portuguese
would be no less obilinate. If we calcu
late what colony monopolies have colt in
wealth, in fufFering, and in crimes, we
frail fay they were dearly purchased
The Englilh would plead for their navi
gation ast, not as a source of gain, but as
an eflential mean of securing their inde
pendence. So many interests would be
disturbed, and so many loft, by a violent
change from the existing, to an unknown
order of things, and the mutual relations
of nations, in refpeft to their power and
wealth, would fuffer such a (hock, that
the idea must be allowed to be perfectly
Utopian and wild. But for this country
to form the project of changing the policy
of nations, and to begin the abolition of
rellriftions by reftriftions of its own, is
equally ridiculous and inconsistent.
Let every nation, that is really disposed
to extend the liberty of commerce, beware
of rash and hasty schemes of prohibition.
In the affairs of trade, as in moll others,
we make too many laws. We follow ex
perience too little, and the visions of theo-
great deal too much. Instead of
listening to discourses on what the market
ought to be, and what the fchemet,which
always proinife much on paper, pretend
to make it, let us fee what it the actual
market for our exports and imports. This
will bring vague affertiont and sanguine o
piniom to the test of experience. That
rage for theory and fyllem, which would
entangleVven practical truth in the web
of the brain, it the poison of public dif
cuffiooâOne fad is better than two sys
tems.
The terms on which our exports are re
ceived in the Britifli market, have been
accurately examined by a gentleman from
South Carolina (Mr. Wm. Smith) Be
fore Iks ilutemunt ot facts was made to
the committee, it was urged, and with
no little warmth, that the system of Eng
land indicated her invetcracy towards this
country, while that of France, springing
from diiinterefted affection, cojiftituted a
claim for gratitude and felf-denying mea
sures of retribution.
Since that statement, however, that ro
mantic (lyle, which is so ill adapted to
the fubjedt, has been changed. We
hear it insinuated, that the comparison of
the footing of our exports, in the mar
kets of France and England, is of no im
portance ; that it is chiefly our object to
fee how we may assist and extend our com
merce. This evaiion of the force of the
statement, or rather this indirect admiffi
-011 of its authority, eftablilhes it. It will
not be pretended that it has been fliaken
during the debate.
It has been made appear, beyond con
tradiction, that the Briti(h market fur our
exports, taken in the aggregate, is a good
one, that it is better than the French,and
better than any we have, and for many
of our products the only one.
The whole amount of our exports to
the British dominions in the year ending
the 30th September 1790, was nine mil
lions two hundred and forty fix thousand
fix hundred and fix dollars.
But it will be more simple and fatisfac
tory to confine the enquiry to the articles
followingâ
Bread-ftuff, tobacco, rice, wood, the
produce of the fifheries, fi(h oil, pot and
pearl ash, salted meats, indigo, live ani
mals, flaxfeed, naval stores, and iron.
The amount of the before mentioned
articles exported in that fame year, to the
British dominions, was 8,457,173 dol
lars.
Mr. Ames went into a consideration of
the footing on which they are received.â
He then said, we have heard so much of
reftri&ion* of inimical and jealous pro
hibitions to cramp our trade, it is natu
ral to scrutinize the Britilh system with
the expe&ation of finding little besides the
effects of her felfifh and angry policy.
Yet of the great sum of nearly eight
millions and an half, the amount of the
products before mentioned fold in her mar
kets, two articles only are dutied by way
of reftri&ion. Bread ftuff is dutied so
high in the market of Great Britain, as
in times of plenty, to exclude it, and this
is done from the desire to favor her own
farmers. The mover of the resolutions
juftified the exclusion of our bread ftuff
from the French Weft Indies by their
permanent regulations, because he said
they were bound to prefer their own pro
ducts to those even of the United States.
It would seem that the fame apology would
do for England, in her home market.
But what will do for the vindication of one
nation becomes invedtive against another.
The criminal nation however ieceives our
bread ftuff in the Weft-Indies free, and
excludes other foreignâfo as to give our
producers the monopoly of the supply.
This is no merit in the judgment of the
mover of the resolutions, because it is a
fragment of her old colony system. Not
withstanding the nature of the duties on
bread ftuff in Great Britain, it has been
clearly Ihewn that she is a better customer
for that article, in Europe, than her neigh
bor France. The latter, in ordinary times,
is a poor customer for bread ftuff, for the
fame reason that our own country is, be
cause she produces it herfelf, and there
fore France permits it to be imported
and the United States do the like Great
Britain often wants the article, and then
she receives itâno country can be expect
ed to buy what it does not want. The
bread-ftuff fold in the European dominions
of Great Britain in the year 1790, amount
ed to 1,087,840 dollars.
Whale-oil pays the heavy duty of eigh
teen pounds three shillings sterling per
ton ; yet spermaceti-oil found a market
there to the value of 81,048 dollars.
Thus it appears that, of eight milli
ons and an half fold to Great Britain and
her dominions, only the value of one mil
lion one hundred and sixty-eight thousand
dollars was under duty of a reftriftive na
ture. The bread-duff it certainly to be
considered as within the description yet
to give the argument its full force, what
is itâabout one-eighth part is reftriaed
âTo proceed with the residue :
Indigo to the amount of
Live animals to the W. Indies
Flax-Seed to Great Britain
Total 756,169
Tbefe articles are received, duty free,
which is a good foot to.the trade. Yet
we find, good as it is, the bulk of our ex
ports is received on even better terms :
Flour to the British W. Indies
Grain - - - 273,505
Freeâwhile other foreign flour and grain
is prohibited.
Tobacco to G. Britain 2,754,493
Ditto to the W* Indies 22,816
One (hilling and three pence fterlmg, du
ty âthree (hillings and fix-pence on o
ther foreign tobacco.
In the Weft-Indies other foreign to
bacco is prohibited.
Rice to G. Britain 773*852
7s 4d. per Cwt. duty; Bs. iod. on other
foreign rice.
To Weft-Indies
Other foreign rice prohibiten
Wood to Great Britain
Freeâhigher duties on other foreign.
To Weft-Indies - - 382,4s
Freeâother foreign prohibited.
Pot and peail-aflies - 747,078
Freeâ2s. 3d. on other foreign, equal to
10 dollars per ton.
Naval stores to Great Britain 190,670
Higher duties on other foreign.
To Welt-Indies
Freeâother foreign prohibited,
Iron to Great Britain
Freeâduties on other foreign
Dollars 6,510,92 6
Thus it appears, that nearly seven
eighths of the exports to the Britifli do*
minions are received on terms of pofitiwe
favor. Foreigners, our rivals in the sale
of these articles, are either abfolutelv
(hut out of their market by prohibitions,
or discouraged in their competition with
us by higher duties. There is some
reftridtion, it is admitted, but there is,
to balance it, a large amount received du
ty free. The above surplus of fix mil
lions and an half, goes to the account of
privilege and favor. This is better than
she treats any other foreign nation it it
better, indeed, than she treats her own
fubjedls, because they are by this means,
deprived of a free and open market it
is better than our footing with any na
tion, with whom we have treaties. It
has been demonstratively (hewn, that it is
better than the footing on which France
receives either the like articles, or the ag
gregate of our produdtsâthe best proof
in the world is, that they are not sent to
Franceâthe merchants will find out the
best market sooner than we {hall.
The footing of our exports, under the
Britifti system, is better than that of their
exports to the United States, under our sys
tem. Nay it is better than the freedom f
commerce, which is one of the visions for
which our solid prosperity is to be hazardtd
âFor fuppofew.-could batter down lier sys
tem of prohibitions and reftrifKons, it would
be gaining a lossâone-eighth is reftridted, and
more than fix-eights has reftriiÂ£tions in its fa
vor. It is as plain as figures can make it, that
if a state of freedom for our exports is par,
the present system raii'es them, in point of
privilege, above par. To suppose that vc
can terrify them, by these resolutions, to
abolish their reltriilions, and at the fame
time to maintain in our favor their duties, to
exclude other foreigners from their market,
is too absurd to be refuted.
We have heard that the market of France
is the great centre of our inter ellsâwe are
to look to her, and not to England, for ad
vantagesâBeing, as the style of theory iâ
our bell cuflomer and bell friend, ihewino- to
our trade particular favor and privilege,
while England manir'efts in her fvftem such
narrow and felfilh views ; it is 11 range to re
mark such a pointed refutation of aflertjons
and opinions by facts. The amount sent ro
France herfelf is very trivial; either our mer
chants are ignorant of the belt markets, or
those which they prefer are the bellâand if
the Englilh markets, in spite of the illcdgeJ
ill-usage, are Hill preferred to the French, it
is a proof of the superior advantages of tli â 
former over the latter. The arguments T
have adverted to, oblige those who urge them
to make a greater difference in favor of the
Englilh than the true state of fad's " ill war
rant. Indeed, if they persist in their argu
ments, they are bound to deny their own
conclusions. They are bound to admit this
pofitionâlf France receives little of such of
our produdls as Great Britain takes on term.,
of privilege and favor, because of that favor
it " Hows the value of that favored footing.
If France takes little of our articles, becauli
she does not want them, it (hews the nbfur
dity of looking to her as the befl ciiiamtr.
It may be fsid, and truly, lhat Great Bri
tain regards only her ov.x l interest in tfcefir
arrangementsâSo much the better. If it
is her interest to rfford to our commerce
more etumuragraeat than France fives, if
Ihe does tins whoi Hit is inveterate again#
us, as it is alletlgcd, and vrheoL ive arc in

81,012dufging an aroused hatred towards her and
partiality towards France, it shews that we
have very solid ground to rely on. Her inte
rell is, according to this itatement, stronger
than our paifions, stronger than her own,
and is the more to be depended on as it can
not be put to any more trying experiment in
future. The good will and friendlhip of na
tions are hollow foundations to build our sys
tems upon. Mutu;Â»l interest is a bottom of
rock. The fervor of transient sentiments is
not better than straw or Hubble. Some gen
tlemen have lamented this distrust of any
relation between nations except an inter eft ed
one. But the substitution of any other prin
ciple could produce little else than the hypo
enfy of sentiment, and an inltability of af
fairs. It would be relying on what is not
liable, instead of what is It would in
troduce into politics the jargon of romance
âIt is in this sense and this only, that the
word favor is used. A state of things so
arranged as to produce our profit and advan
tage, though intended by Great-Britain
merely for her own. The disposition of a
nation is immaterial, the fad that we pro
fit by their fyitem cannot be so to this dif
cufiion.
The next point is to consider whether our
imports are on a good footing, or in other
words, whether we are in a situation to buy
what we have occasion for at a cheap rate,
in this view, the systems of the commercial
nations are not to be complained of, as all
are desirous of felling the produtfts of their
labour. Great Brifam is not censured in
this refpe<fl. The obje<slion is rather of th,e
opposite kind that we buy too c&eap anjj
therefore eonfume too much,arid that we take
not only as much as we can pay for, but to
the extent of our credit aUo. There is lets
freedom of importation, however, from the
Weft Indies âin this refpeel, France is more
reftri&ive than England âfor the .former al
lows the exportation to us of only rum and
molaflfes, while England admits that,of su
gar, coffee, and other principal Weft India
produ<sls. Yet, even here, when the pre
ference seems to be decidedly due to the Bri
tilh system, occasion is taken to extol that of
the French. We are tolcl that they fell us
the chief part of the mobiles j which is con -
fumed, or manufactured into rumâand that
a great and truly important branch, the dil
tHlery, is kept up by their liberality in fiir
nifhing the raw material. There is,, ?t every
ft'ep, matter to confirm the remar#, that
nations have framed their regulations to fu|J:
their own interests, not oursâFrance is a
great brandy manufacturer. She will not ad
mit rum therefor,e.eveu fromher own islands,
because it would supplant the consumption
of brandy* The molalfes was for that reaf n
some years ago of no value in her islands, and
was not even saved in calks. But the de
mand from America soon raised its value.
The policy of England has been equally fel
fifh. moiafies is distilled in her
because lhe has no manufacture of brandy
to fuffer bv its sale.

AUGUSTA, Jan, 18.
On Saturday last, Major Robrrt For
syth, Marshal lor the State [Diftrift]
of Georgia, was killed in the execution
of his office, at the house of Mrs. Dixon
in this place, by Beverly Allen of South-
Carolina. A (ketch of the particulars
is as follows : Major Forfyth being about
to serve the aforefaid Allen with a writ :
From a principle of delicacy, aflced him
out of the room, where there were several
gentlemen present, upon business in which
the fa id Allen was interested ; âhe aflTent
ed, and perhaps added these words " with
pleasure âbut instead of following, he
aflced some one apart, " is not that Ma
jor Forfyth ?"âbeing answered in the
affirmative, he inquired about the key of
the room opposite, and having obtained
it, he retired thither; âin the interim the
Major had made service of a writ on
William Allen, brother to the said Bever
ly, and had granted him some period of
indulgenceâthis, was spent in the room
to which his brother had retired, and af
ter being elapsed, the Major going up
flairs reminded William that his time was
expired, (MefTrs. Richards and Randolph,
a&ing as Deputy Marshals, were now at
the room door and prevented its being
entirely (hut, which was the object of ex
ertion within) and Major Forfyth ad
vancing towards the door, was told by
Beverly Allen, " if he came further, (or
words to that effed) he would blow his
brains out," which, said Allen, it is as
serted by diiinterelled and refpe&able
persons present, at the' fame instant dis
charged a pistol through the opening of
the door, and verified his fatal threat by
killing the Marshal on the spot.
Thus fell, a facrifice to his delicacy, by
tiie hand of a wretch, to fill up the mea
sure of whose iniquities, it feem'd only to
want an a& of such atrocity, a man whose
cbara&er is highly revered by all who had
the pleasure of his acquaintance, whose
a&ive, social, chearful and benevolent turn
of mind rendered him an ufeful and plca
fant member of society, and whose remo
val from this scene of things, affords a
molk striking and inftru&ivc lesson of mor-
tality.
He was Interred in the Church-yard
here on Monday with every vefpedt which
could be paid him, in a public or private
capacity : Being, at the time of his de
cease, Deputy-Grand-Master of the State,
as well as Pa It-Mailer of the Lodge-Co
lumLia, a numerous proceflion of the bre
thren accompanied his remains, and depo
sited them in the houj'e appointed far all
living.

FEBRUARY 15.
The contested election of Mr. Gallatin
was the fubjeft before the Senate of the
United States this dayâthe doors of the
Senate Chrmber were opened on the occa
sion.
At one o'clock, on motion, the further
consideration of the business was postpon
ed till Wednesday next.
A Boston paper fays, " Mr. Madison's
Resolutions are too moderate" for some
peopleâ" they would apply a guillotine
to our commerce, as well as to our necks,
and do every thing at a Jlro c."
Fhom Cozrfspondsnts.
Sometimes our incendiary fait ion pre
tend to be on tlie fide of the people, and
they rail with no little felf-fufficiency at
the creatures of the court. In their jargon
the people are on one fide, the court 011
the opposite. These boneft gentlemen have
found their do&rine overthrown and dis
graced by the people themselves. The
whole country took part with the Presi
dent, and this wonderful unanimity ought
to Hop their mouths. The people howe
ver, are treated as insolently as their ma
gistrates. l'or the faction allure us, that
the addreflers on the fubjeft of the Pro
clamation of Neutrality are stock-jobbers,
paper-mon, and British-agents. Fadts
(hew how little these wretches, refpeft
the people, or are supported by them.
The fame wranglers who dread the cor
rupting influence of birth-day celebrations,
behave as if they could not toait and cele
brate Genet enough. The meaning Is
plain in both inltancesâthey wiih to bring
one man within the reach of contempt,
and to raise the other above itâhie labor,
hoc opus eft, which is, they are knaves
'for their pains.
One of the toads of the 6th of Februa
ry, fays something about truth and inno
c.'iice. Was it not harsh and even cruel,
when Citizen Candor and Frankness was
present ? Personal insults 011 men in
public character are very unbecoming.
Question to the Demo Society if a
man is bound as a good and true Mobo
crat to hate and undermine the Republi
can Government of, his own country, how
happens it that you oblige him to swear
to be faithful and true to an anarchy,
nicknamed republican, beyond seas ? If
it be because it is anarchy, (hall we not be
forced when it (hall have ripened into a
governmsnt ro hate it for that very reason
as much as we do our own ? Being a cafe
of conscience you are requeftcd to publilh
a resolution expressly on the point.
For the Gazette of the United States.
Mr. Fenno,
I observed in Mr. Bache's paper of Sa
turday, a publication, in which the wri
ter boldly asserts that the Farmers of Ma
ryland are generally in favor of Mr. Madi
son's resolutions; how he can have obtain
ed this information to speak with the cer
tainty he has, is to me astonishing. I
have heard the sentiments of feveraljudici
ous and refpeftable farmers of that state,
and a great many citizens of other vocati
ons, which have been pointedly opposed
to the adoptien of them. 1 rather suppose
that not a twentieth part of the Maryland
Farmers have ever heard of Mr. Madison's
Resolutions, much less have given their
opinion upon them.

At No. 118, Market Jtreet,
A Large nod Valuable
Peale's Museum,
HAS Lately received â¢ number of article? ;
arnc.ng which are the. following : That
reinaskable bird called the Cut-water, or fcif-
ars-hill; The Avofette, commonly called the
Shoe-make*, because of its bill refetnbling a
crooked awlâThe Long-legs, commonly call
ed the Black-bet, having perhaps the longed legs,
in proportion to the fire of the bird, of any of
he feathered tribi.âThe Storm-finch, common-
1/ called mother Cary's chickenâThe Sea
fwallow, and various Gulls ; besides
ol CÂ«anfs, Curlews, Snipes, &c.
Tht fcuil of a Whale and one of its Vertebres.
An Indian hatchct made of chiyftal : It is
curious that those uninformed wild people, hav-
ing very little knowledge of the aits, and being
ignorant even of the existence of iron and steel,
ihould be able to form such hard fubftanccs in
to fanciful forms as this, and other Indian ma-
uif<>Â£tures now in the Museum,
A lignified Quince : The specimen (hews
what a rctnukable effetta dry warm situation
has on fruit. It is now about 8 years since it
was gathered ; and it was a real quince, now be
come wood, at leall in appearance.
Presented by Mn. Man foil of Charleftown,
S. C.âa tool used by the Otabeitans in making
their bark cloth, by pounding the bark on this
nftruntent of wood, it produces the ribs which
referable threads : the perfe&ly straight and
equal lines madt in (his extreme hard wood, by
men without the use of iron,are curious & won
derful.
Alio, a rope made of grass, part of the tigg
ing of a vessel of Kamfkatka.
Presented by Dr. Hall, of Lewis-town, a Squib
in fpirils : when this fi(h was toupd, a number
ot (tones were appended to firings or ligaments
that projected from the front of ita head,whtch
oicdfioiu-d a conjecture, as it is not furnifhed
with fufficient fins to resist the violence of the
tide and currents, that it faftened with these li
gaments on whatever it found at the bottom \ so
that the flones answered the purpofeof anchors
and the ligamentsof a glutinous dicky nature,
that of cables. Some of the Hones are in the
fa*ne phial.
A collision of Minerals tand other Foflils-
a r e now difplaycd in drawers covered with glass
and in a mode which willfceure them from de
rangement. To each specimen are affixed refe
ren; es to a book of description.*. This manage
ment of specimens of the Fossil kingdom, len
ders this part of the Museum very convenient
and fatisfaÂ£fory,and great attention will be paid
to the fuftematical order of them, and in mak
ing the nect ffary t flays of each : Also in giving
in a concise manner, the various uses they are
applied to; thereby rendering them the more
interesting so the public.
A Living Elk, of 2 years old, is just receiv
ed. By the account which monf. Buffon gives
of the Elk, it. appears that he was not acquaint
ed with this American animal; he particularly
omits alt notice of the curious apertures adjoin
ing the eyes of this Elk.

By THOMAS DO3SON,

VOLUME X. OF

Of A rs, Sciences, and Mifcellaneoui

Miscellaneous articles, illuitrated with Twen

As a number of families are frill in the
country,. and it is not genet ally known who
arereturned. T. Dubfon, lolicits the favor
of the fubfenbers to call or fend for their vo
lumes, that they may be supplied as early as
poilible.
The tenth volume of the Encyclopedia is
now presented to the public ; but as it makes
its appearance in an imperfett Itate, some ac
count of the reason of that imperfection lliould
be uiven. On the Brh of September last, the
Publifiier had the misfortune of having his
Printing-office burnt down by a fire which
broke out in the neighbourhood, and a great
quantity of his printing materials deft roved,
and among other articles, the figures, wit 1Â«
which he was printing the tablf.i of lo
garithms, belonging to the prelent volume,
were melted down by the violence of the fire.
As a supply of these could not be immediately
obtained, he was under the necessity of pub
li(hing the volume without rhe'e tables; but
hopes he Avail be able to publish them with the
next volume which is now in confidcrable for-
wardnefs,
The Publisher embraces this opportunity of
exprefling his grateful acknowledunients to
the generous public, for the very liberal pa
tronage with which his undertaking has been
honored; at the fame time he takes the li
berty of representing to such of the subscribers
as are in arrears, the indifpenfible necessity of
punctuality, both in-taking up the volumes ai
early as poflrble after publication, and of pay
ing for them when taken. Many of the sub
scribers having got only one, two, three,
volumes, and several volumes remain unpaid.
Thus the work hangs in all its different stages
from the commencement; and though the im
portance of a few dollars may be but a trifle
to the individuals, yet the accumulation of
these trifles xjnp/id lays the Publiiher under
very serious embarraflment,and deprives him
of the ufeof many ThoufandsÂ«f Dollars which
at this time would be of very essential service.
For these reasons the Publiiher finds himfelt
under the neceflity of recurring to the original
terms of publication, and in future no vo
lumes will be delivered but only to those who
take and pay to the time of publication.
