BRUSSELS, Januarys
Intelligence has been received here,
that the blockade of Landau is raised. It
appears that the French - had continued
their attacks every day, until the 26th
ult. when they advanced early in the morn,
ing, in force against the Duke of Brunf
wick, who was at Bergzabern, with his
van-guard, commanded by prince Hohen
lohc: That the grenadier battalion of
Kleift, and two companies of chasseurs
advanced to meet the French ; that they
were at firft repulsed, but that prince Ho
henlohe then marched forward to their
support with some artillery, and that the
enemy was at last completely routed; That
towards mid-day, however, the attack was
renewed on he right of Gen. Wui mfer's
position, who was compelled to retreat,
and has since re-crofled the Rhine in two
columns. The duke of Brunfwick takes a
position to cover Mayence. A garrison is
left in Fort Louis.
A letter from Frankfort, December
29, has been received :
" The Imperialists, ported near Hague
nau, although attacked incefiantly, were
enabled to maintain their ground until
the 22d of Decemben On that day, the
Republican troops advanced against them
with such superiority of force, and with
such a tremendous train of artillery, that
after a very vigorous resistance, they were
forced to cvacuate Haguenau, and retreat
with great precipitation, to Sultz, near
Weifiembourg.
" It was deemed neceflary, however,
on the next day, to take a polition near
Weiflembourg, in order that the Imperi
aliits might not be so much exposed to the
inceflant attacks of the enemy, who in eve
ry attack come forward with frefh troops.
" The French, having obliged the al
lies to retreat from Haguenau, resolved to
persevere in that fyllem, which had pro
duced such important advantages to them.
On the 26th instant, a meflenger arrived
here, who brought the important intelli
gence, that a column of 22,000 Repub
licans, has pierced the right wing of Gen.
Wurmfer's army; that 4000 of their ca
valry had turned the redÂ»ubts established
near Werth and Reichfhoven, and that,
meeting with no more obllacles, the ene
my attacked Gen. Wurmfer's army in the
rear of their position. Some battalions of
the troops of Hesse Darmstadt newly raised,
with the Palatine troops, who were port
ed in the entrenchments, gave way, and
by their flight, occasioned a general re
treat.
" The Pruflians, with the Imperialists.
being forced to change their position, toÂ«k
that on the heights of Weiflembourg ; and
Gen. Wurmfer, moving from Sultz, ap
proached near to Weiflembourg. The
Republicans with the whole mass of their
forces, estimated at 120 and according to
others at IJO,OOO men, not giving our
brave troops a moment's reft, having con
tinually annoyed them for more than a
month past, made poftgrior to the 26th, a
general and irrefiftable attack on the cen
tre of the combined army which unable to
refill such a severe (hock, being moreover
exhausted with fatigue, and in want of
ammunition, were forced to retreat to
wards Spire and Manheim. The Duke
of Brunfwick, at the fame time was un
der the neceflity 'of retreating towards
Mentz.

" 1 hus, the iiege of Landau is raised.
As it is supposed, that the French will
make further irruptionsâfamilies of all
dalles here, are preparing for flight.
" The raising of the siege of Landau,
is confirmed by a person, who from the
heights of Neuftadt, saw the French ar
my under the walls of Landau.
" Since yefterdy several hundred citi
zens, without any diftinftion of itate or
condition, have been busily employed in
working at the ramparts."
Extract of a letter from Manbeim, dated
December 2 &
" The French are advancing in three
columns, one towards Weifl'embourg, ano
ther towards Anweiler, and the third to
wards Lautern. The baggage of the
Auftrians has been removed to Ketfch,
near Spiresâand that of the Pruflians to
Maykammer, one league from Neuftadt.
" Accounts have been received, that
the Auftrians have retreated to, and ta
ken up their Head-Quarters at Germer
(lieim. The siege of Landau is raised.
" Letters from Worms, dated Decem
ber 25, state, that the situation of the al
lies in Alsace, had become very critical,
after the a<ftion of the 2 2d. Most of she
inhabitants fled from Weifiembourg and
the Military Hospital was also removed
thence."
LONDON, Jan. 8.
Letters from Barcelona, of the Bth
ult. bring the Spanifli accounts, of the
check received bp the French army, late
ly mentioned in the Convention. These
letters fay that the Marquis de Caftrilo,
had driven the French from the valley of
Banuls, with the loss of two pieces of
cannon, and a great number of prisoners
âthat on the 7th ult. at fix o'clock in
the morning, the Spanish Geneial Curf
tin, attacked the great camp of the
French, and their batteries of L'Ermi
tage. Both these attacks were so fuc
cefsful, that at nine o'clock in the morn
ing, the Spaniards were completely mat
ters of the field, and the French camp,
took 24 pieces of cannon, and a vast
quantity of ammunition, and provisions,
besides 600 prisoners. The loss of the
Spaniards, does not exceed 200 men both
killed and woundedâand, that of the
French, in killed, is affi'rted to be very
considerable.

fubjeft oj indemnity and lequeitratfon
AF l hR the private business was over, Mr. !Ma
difoiifaid if no gentleman had any thing to propose,
which in the present juri&ure was deemed of an
urgent nature, he should call for the commercial
regulations, which, though less prefling than some
other fubjetts, yet required a liecifion.
Mr. Mnith (S C.) then rose and laid he had pre
pared a motion on a lubjeft which to him appeared
nrgent, and to require the early attention of Con
gress. It was the fubjeit ot indemnity to the own
ers of vessels and cargoes which bad been captured
by some of the belligerent powers, contrary to the
law of nations. He mentioned several reasons why
this business ihould now be determined on; these
were, the neceflity of an e-rly hquidation and as
certainment of the claims of the lufferers, in order
to enable the executive to demand reparationâto
enable the committae of ways and means to form a
better estimate of the public exigenciesâto hold out
some comfort to the unfortunate fufferers and a pro
fpetl of relief, without which many might be in
duced to abandon their callings, and perhaps to emi
grate to other countries. He said lie was strongly
impressed with the principle that where our citizens
were pursuing a lawtul trade, and were despoiled of
their property, that the government not having af
forded protection, was bound to make compensation,
fubjed to a reimbursement by the aggrefi'ors: That
as the government was the channel through which
the indemnification was to be obtained, the aggriev
ed were to look to the government, and the govern
ment to the apgrelTors: He was therefore fatisfied
that in the firft inltance these jult claims when ascer
tained ought to be paid out of the public reafury j
that a demand ought immediately to be made tor
restitution and compensation, and that when it
should be withheld, Congrefsfhouid determine on the
proper means for obtaining redrels. Mr. Smith re
marked that the proportion, made some time ago by
Mr.Madif,n on this lubjefi being predicated on an
increale of duties, was inapplicable to the present
crisis, and resting solely on a fund which would pro
bably never exist, held out no profpeA of relief. Be
lides, that proposition depended on the success of a
number of antecedent ones, which might not be as
dopted, and if they were, would be at a dittant
period, whereas this fubjeft called for immediate
confederation. He then read the following ret'olu
tions :
Resolved, That provision ought to be made for
the indemnification of all citizens of the United
States, whose veiTels or cargoes have been seized and
confifcated by any of the belligeret powers, contrary
to the law of nations.
Refolved,That a committee be appointed to prepare
a bill *<> Carry the foregoing resolution into effedfc.
'I hefe resolutions being seconded ar.d rÂ«*aa from
the chair.
Mr. Daytm-rofe and said he (honld not agree IP
the proportion of the gentleman from S. C. unless
it were contested with one which (hould designate
the fund from whence the indemnity was to be de
rived: He had prepared a resolution combining the
two fubjtfis, rthich, being indilpofed, he did not
intend to bring forward that day, but as the gentle
man last up had called the attention of the House to
ft, he fliould read his potion and lay-it on the ta
ble,. in order that the two iubjtcts might be taken
Up together.
Mr. Dajton then read his resolution, to this ef
fect, viz. That provision ought to be made by law
for fequeftcring 111 debts due to ny IWbjefts of the
Bntilh king, to be kept as a pledge for the the resti
tution of (he vessels and cargoesof the United States,
which had been feited and conlifcated by the Bn
tilh (hips of war and cruisers, contrary to the law
of nations and in violation of our rights.â
Mr. D. said it was no longer a secret that the
Britilh nation were resolved to be at war with
this country âthat this was maaiftfted by the
speech of Lord Dorcheiier, and by their un
juftifiable seizure and confiscation of our pro
perty ; that we were bound to retaliateâthat
all hope of retaliation of the damages sus
tained was perfectly chemerical, un'.efs we
compelled it by some means of this kind. In
stead of sequestering, he thought Congress
had a right to confifcate Bntilh tjtbts both in
the funds and in the hands of individuals ; but
he would go no farther than fequefiration,
and confine it to private debts.
Mr. Dayton's propolition being read, it was mo.
ved that the houlc lhould resolve itlelfinto a com
mittee on this bulinefs immediate'y.
This occalioned a long debate.
Mr. Fitzlimons said it waj a l'ubjÂ»Â£l which ought
to be immediately decidedâthe public mind ought
nvt to be kept in lulpenfe ; he was against the pro
portion of fequeliration, but he Ihould vote lor ta
king it up now, and deciding upon it.
Mr. Kittera and Mr. Irvine said, if any thing
ot the kind was intended, it ought not to be delayed
as a delay would defeat the measure, by giving time
10 make transfers and alignments : That transfers
had already taken place, trom the apprehealion of
such a measure.
Mr. Ames conceived that a measure offuch Â»se
rious nature ought not to be precipitated. He Itill
cherilhed the hope of peace âhe would to the lalt;
moment struggle against every thing like
war,he therefore reprobated every proportion
which had a tendency todrive usinto a war,
until all negoc iation failed.
Several members expreffcd a wifti to go
into committee merely to consider the fub
jeft, without wishing for a decision on tiiat
day.
Mr. Boudinot had not made np his mind
so as to give an opinion, he requeiled a delay
for one or two days.
Mr. Tracy was ajainft going now irtto
committee; hedid not lay what cnange might
be brought about in his opinion by the debate,
but at present the proportion appeared to him
an outrage upon common hunt JtyT
Mr. Mercer and Mr. Dayton disapproved
of these exprefiions'; they thought thÂ» coa
dopt of Great Britain juitifiÂ«d the measure.
Mr. Smiley laid wc were in a fiate of war,
and the measure was necefi'ary for felf-de
fence.
Mr Smith S. C. observed that wheu
hepropofed the indemnification, he was un
acquainted wilh the intention of conne&ing
with it, the illbjeft of liequeitration ; he
wished the two fubjefts might be fepara
tcd ; the interest which a great number of
citizens took in the success of the former
might give an improper biafs and impulse,
in faror of the latter, and attach a degree
oi populaiity, to a measure which viewed
by itfelf, and in cooler moments might be
disapproved by those who uow juftified it.
He itated that it had been the invaria
ble pra&ife of the house, on occasions e
ven of the greatell importance, to let a
proposition lie a few days for considera
tion ; yet on this occasion, avowedly of
the most serious complexion and of the
highest importance, they were prefTed to
an opinion, without even one day's no-
In anfvvcr to the argu-
tiee
ment that it was only intended tc
look at the fubjeft and not to decide, he
said that members might commit them
selves too hastily and get fixed in their o
pinionsâwhereas, the fubjeft ought to be
taken up after mature reflection.
The only reason he had heard for an im
mediate decision was the preventing transfers;
he admitted there was something in this,
but he suggested a mode of obviating the
difficulty, which was to pass a vote, prohibit
ing transfers for so or ;,o days, during which
time the irxmbers might have leisure to de
liberat calmly on a lubje<st which involved
the national character, and which certainly
ought not to be precipitated.âSeveral other
members i'poke, and the question being put.
the motion for going into committee was
carried, 51 voting in the affirmative.

ExtraA of a letter from a refpe<slable mer

" The fuuation of our navigation here is.
at this time, truly distressing : two (hips loft,
and two detained in Bourdeaux, for three
months, by our good allies, for what cauie
we: know not. The fear of Mr. M's refolu
tioni being adopted prevents our fending
thole for England that were designed for that
voyage. I think those resolutions, if agreed
to, will ruin more than half the merchants
here, aa their greatest intereftis in (hipping,
and they are as ill calculated to fecurc to us
the advantages arifmg from the carrying
trade, as the throwing away the weights of
a clock would be to make the time-piece go
fafter, However I trull Congress will never
be so loft to the true interest of the country
as to adopt rhem ; and I hope the representa
tives from this state will continuefirm against
them.
" I am sorry to hear of so much opposi
tion to a navy, which m-jft be a neceflary de
fence to our navigation ; and we have too
much left without a protection. This
too will make us more refpeftable as a mari
time nation among the powers of Europe. I
hope Congress will enquire into the causes of
the detention of our (hips in the ports of
France and procure reparation.
A war ought to be avoided if poTibleâ
for in addition to the horrors of a war, when
wc are once in we shall be so connected with
the warring powers of Europe, that no mor

A bill is before the legislature of this

purpose of fortifying the port of NVv/-

of 12,0001. for defraying the expencc of
floating batteries, vefTela of forceand for
tifications on the northern and wettern
waters.
The folio-wing Letter is jvjl received from
Your letter in behalf of our fellow-citi
zens, we this moment received, and we
have the fatisfaÂ£Vion to inform you, that
your requefl has already been anticipated
by the House of Assembly, and that a
bill appropriating thirty thousand pounds,
for fortifying the port of New-York, has
pasTed the AiTembly.
Deeply impressed with the magnitude
of the objeÂ£l recommended to our consi
deration, we did not after the rejection of
the former bill from the Senate, despair of
eventual success in both Houses of the
Legislature, and judged it our duty to
renew the fubjeft. We now rejoice to
fay, that we have every reasonable expec
tation of success, and trull the legislative
provision will be such, as to promote the
wifhcs of our fellow-citizens and to com
port with the interest and dignity of
the State.
