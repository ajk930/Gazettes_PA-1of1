CONGRESS.
House of Reprefentaliies.
May 15.
This day came on in the House of Re
presentative's of the United States, the
consideration of the resolution some time
past laid on the table by Mr. Goodhue,
for guaranteeing an indemnification to
those fufferers who had sustained lodes by
British spoliation on our commerce
Mr. Goodhue moved that the refohi
tion might be referred to a committee of
the whole House, wbich was seconded by
Mr. Dexterâit was then moved by way
of amendment to the motion b" Mr. Day
ton, to these words, " to whom was
rsferrrjfcfrhc r_filuihin for the fequtjlration of
British M'ti, to which Mr. Gbodhue ob
jv/fted, because ,lt? laid fujjjefts jjtere
dillinft and in their natiiri and
flaght not to.be combined ; his resolution
went qnly to ejlablifh the principle of in
demnification by guaranteeing it to the
fufferers, leaving the fund from which it
ihould he made, {in cafe Great Britain
should refufe to do us justice) to a future
Â£oaiidvtjLU<U<Â» that whether British debts
were letnieffered or not, he said the Unit
ed States were bound to fee that indemnity
was dudt'to the merchants whose proper
ty had been kidnapped in a secret clan
destine manner, while pursuing a law
ful trade under the authority of this go
vernment and the law of nations, or to
give them an opportunity of indemnifying
themfdves by making reprisalsâthat it
was well known there was great oppofitic-fi
to the feqiieftration of British debts, aid
it was very doubtful whether such a mea
sure would ever be adopted ; and if this
resolution was to be referred to the fame
committee and become connected with
that, he should very much despair of ever
getting any indemnification; that British
debts were a very precarious and uncertain
fund, and the idea of ever getting indem
nification from that source would operate
as a delusion, that if fequeltration under
any circumstances could be proper, it was
highly improper at this time when an en
voy extraordinary had just been dispatched
to Great Britain, and more so as we had
difcontinucd the embargo, which would
put all onr'remaining vefiels in the power
of that nationâhe (hould therefore consi
der an agreemeent to the amendment as
amounting to a determination not to coiw
fider the l'ubjeft at lead for the present
feflion.
In support of the amendment it was
argued, that the two fubjefts had an inti
mate connection with each other, and ne
ver ought to be separated ; that Brjtifh
debts and British property, were the na
tural and only funds, for paying British
depredations, and if indemnity was not
given this way, it ought not to be given
at all; that as it was probable, the reso
lution fo> would lay dormant
for some time, it was belt to refer this to
the fame committee, that they might.ffeep
together-âthe amendment was supported
by Messrs. Lyman, Dayton, Nicholas,
Smilie, Dearborn, Madison, Clark and
Giles.
Mr. Dextei against the amendment,
said, that very ftiong reasons existed both
for taking into confideraunn a proposition
for indemnity to the futferers, and also
against connsfting it with fequeflration or
any other fubjeft. Each ought to stand
or fall on its own merits. The fufferer's
were numerous and deserving citizens;
they had waited a long time, and had a
right to know before the close of the fefli
-110 what protection they were to expect
from the government of their own coun
try. Sequestration without a change of
political circumstances would never pass
both Houses of the Legislature ; to con
nect them then, would be to deny relief,
without even examining the principles on
which they claim it. He said British debts
had been called the only proper and natu
ral funds ; in his opinion they would be no
fund at all, even if fequeltration could be
adopted ; the debls would never be col
lected ; and not only so, but fequeflration
would be the beginning of hoflilities, and
wai must ensue; this at the fame moment
would pi event all hope of obtaining justice
from Britain, and also discharge our own
government from every obligation to in
demnify. Mr. D. said he would slate,
what in'his opinion was the proper and na
tural fund ; the money to be demanded of
Britain by our envoy extraordinary. Should
this fail, the government of America would
either pay the fufferers or grant them let
ters of marque and reprizal. This, he
said, is the conflant course of nations, and
this the fufferers have a right to demand
as a counterpart of their allegiance. Mr.
D. said it had been objected that the Bri
tish government would be encouraged by
it to refufe a recompence. This if true,
would be a serious objection, for he had
always viewed negociation as affording the
only probable chance for indemnity to'the
fufferers; if a recompence be refufed by
B. itain, war will be the consequence. The
objection however he thought would be
entirely removed by attending to the reso
lution itfelf. It is not he said a provision
or taking the debt on ourselves, but meet
ly to guarantee a recompence to the fuffer
ers ; the very word implies that the 20-
v* cf At - t ,-rt th* tr-w"'Â®!
f debtor, but is to tompel another to make
f iidemnity, ot- become the debtor- Mr.
D. closed with fa; ing that he had attend
? Ed only to the teafoning of the gentlemen
1 aid not to their personalities ;it was not
i his practice to leave the to impute
tj otheis, motives either corrnnt or pal
i try ;if they chose to glean iihaginary lau
t rds on this ground, he was not anxious to
i flare them; they could but judge whether
; in this way they were likely to encreafc
3 their reputation, or benefit the public.
MefTrs. Sedgwick, Ames, Murray,
Smith of South-Carolina, and Hillhouie,
also spoke against the amendment, and
said the merits of neither proposition were
now before the house, but only the mode
in which the fnbjeft should be considered
i âthat they were in themfclves separate
and independent, and ought to have a se
parate and independent considerationâ
i they were questions of very great nation
i al concern, and that blending them toge
ther would give an undue bias, and neither
would be fairly and impartially decided.
It was doubtful whether the resolution
; for sequestration ever ought to be adopt
â  ed, and that to conned the two fubjefts,
! would be to hang a mill (tone about the
necks of the fufferersâthat as they were
j a numerous and very meritorious class of
i citizens, their claim merited a candid snd
â¢ full examination, uuembarrafTed with any
other matter.

amendment, and were as follows: â

For the G jzette of the United States.
CONSIDERATIONS on EXCISE.
THAT the manufacturers of the United
States are unwilling to contribute their (hare
in the expences of government, and that
they reft perfectly content, let who-may,
kear that duty, so they are exempt, are
charges, which with a considerable lhare of
iiduitry, are endeavoured to be impi elled on
! the public mind.
To a class of citizens unconscious of a dif
polition inimical to the happinefsof society,
relying on their induury, ufefulnel's, and ir
reproachable conduct lor the approbation Of
their fellow men, no afpernon could have
been more injurious ; it is therefore in urn
bent upon.them to state some few faCts, from
which the unprejudiced will make the due
inference.
That the expences of government a-e to
b: defrayed is' moll true, and ehearfuhy
ought the citizens of this highly favoured
country to contribute each his apportiohate
lhare ; it ihould be considered as a free wi!l
oflcring rarher than an exaction ; it is a mu
tual participation in the expen es of' that so
ciety, by which we are protcifkd in our per
sons and property.
If the proportions of wealth is the just
criterion by which to rcgjlate the quota of
tax for each individual, and that it is, ap
pears confirmed by the popular opinionâ
" that Luxuries Jhould be the mojl heavlfy r.f
fejjed, because the cpule/it are the consumers"
it could be easily diftinguilhed that the manu
facturer and they who (from their sank in
â wealth) are termed the middle class of citi
zens, have not only paid their fufficiency,but
greatly more âas a tenant, he must frequent
ly pays the tax on the realeftate of his land
lord, and as a citizen over and above his own
he participates in the taxes levied for the
protection of the delinquent personal proper
ty (however overgrown) of the wealthy ci
tizen.
Toalledge then that the manufacturer or
the industrious mechanic fliall pay, even yet
more than this excise to which he is now ac
cuHomed in order to preserve unfubfidized
that property which the power of wealth has
hitherto secured from afieflment even for its
~-r-'CVjon, is nothic?; lhort - ;c! -

If on accpAut of*nfre banditti of that kind of
exciferfxii hitherto unknown in America,
with the rigor of the laws nece.'iary to give
efficiency, and to qualify their infolenee, it
in itfelf the most execrable, and to the liber
ties oi freemen the molt dangerous.âls ir
becaafe they poflefs more enterprise, are
more ingenious, or that they are lefe lirupu
lous of the sweat of their brow, that they
are to be fiugled out? are then their peculiar,
improvements, knowledge, or excellence,
the result, perhaps, of y< ars of a/fiduity and
research, to be of no longer value, and are
to be subjeCted to the moil common inspec
tion and exposure ? I hope not. But the a
pology (and experience proves it only an a
pology) is, that the coufumer arr.i _ not the
manufacturer will pay the duty j had this bean
well founded or the result of djie-enquiry, it
would have been some conlolation ; tluf it
is either I deny, and in confirmation take one
well tried, stern, and recent fadt, in prefe
rence to a volume of theory.
The iate excise on wines, &e. in the state
of Pennsylvania was Bd. per gallon, the fair
dealer paid the duty, and demanded a profit
ot io per cent, which included waiie, &c.
the falfe fweartr de uanded no fich profit,
the duty answered his purpose, the ultimate
proved that nfftead of a revenue to the state,
it became a bounty tor his perjury, mauÂ°*re
all the watchfulnds which could be exerted
for its lupport. "Need Ito add that what lit- ,
tie duty the state received, was paid by the
| iuir trade, whole bufmefs in Confeqnence itc
camepf no value, while the abandoned chaÂ» '
raCterflourilhtd on thfc bulk of the duty con
teinplated for the commonwealth.
The receipts into the Treafurv became
daily less, until at the formation of the fede
ral government notwithstanding the vigi
lance of a worthy office it became wh~n
compared with the expeCted amount a v-ry
pittance, but if viewed with refpedt to its
effect on foviety, dreadful.âShould I be-here
told that it was in confeqnence of the Inef
ficiency of the law , the hi'ilory of all revenue
fyltems in Europe will make the answer aril
prove that the utmoil deipotifm is unequal
to their maintenance.
One of the greeted securities which the
community have is, that when the Legisla
ture levy a tax, they in general alio tax
themselves ; but iu the instance of an excTe
on manufactures it is possible they may
-overwhelm, while themfeives fee! none of
the effect. Wealth begets gower, and po\ver
too oft leads to ufurpatjoii; to obviate these
imprefiions, protect the riling interests of dis
country, induce harmony <n society and good
W'U to its rulers is peculiarly the duty of the
reprelebtative of a free people, and hiseleva
tron to that h.'iior which his feliow
ciiizens can confer, will I trust, be a pledge
lor the faith'ul and exemplary maintenance
of the compact for support of just and equal
rights, forbearance in power, rejection of
felf interest, and an attachment to the prin
ciples of equal liberty, are the means by
which his rose to the highelt pinnacle of hu
man honor, and real dignity one of our fel
low citizens, and whose prudence and mag
nanimity receive apphufe even in the cabi
nets of Europe.
As flourifhes the state, fuffer then to flou-.
rtfh the manufactures and cherilh the arts,
chargeable only with an equitable (hare of
its burdens, and having arrived at just earn
ed wealth under the countenance of a good
administration, their participation in its ex
pences lhall bear its fulleft proportion, so
(hall the happiness of the community be
permanently fixed and the rulers of govern

That the laid Cuits were avowedly com

Resolved, Fuji, that the freedom of

the Jegiflature ; and form the ftror.geft
palladium of the rights of jhe people.
Resolved, Secondly, that from the na
ture of the conthtution of this Hate, it is
eflential and inherent in the legislature,
that the members thereof, aiting in either
house, are not liable and cannot legally
be qnellioiied elfevvhere, for their conduit,
or the motives thereof.
Resolved, thirdly, that while each
house necessarily possesses the right of
cenluring or punishing improper conduit
in any of its members, it is equally the
province ti the house, to protect the mem
bers thereof from molestation from any
other person, or in any other place.
Resolved, Fourthly, that as the above
have always been the received and known
usage of the legislature of this country,
,any person, by proccfs of law, or other
wise, attempting to infringe or coimteraft
the fame, acts in open contempt and defl
ate of the rights, powers and privileges
\ti the legislature, and deserves the seve
rest anirnad vevfions therefore.
Resolved, fifthly, that Stephen Dray,
ton, for prosecuting the members of a
tommiitee of this house, for conduit in
the home; and Alexander Moultrie, for
having ailed as attorney in this behalf,
and lifting process of law, and causing
them to be arretted, have knowingly,
wilfully, and flagrantly violated the rights,
pawers and privileges of the house of re
presentatives.
Resolved, sixthly, thSt in the opinion of
this committee, any attorney, within this
state, commencing or prosecuting a suit,
against any member of this house, for any
thing said or done by him, as a member
(he the said attorney knowing the said
suit is forfomething fai<j or done as a mem
ber) is unworthy of his office, and ought
not to be fuffered to paaftice in any of the
courts of judicature under the authority
of this ttate.
Resolved, fryenthly, that the said Alex

having knowingly, wilfully, and flagrant

i could afford us bo protection: In confe- j
i-uence of w'hirh we are under the rifagree
able necefnty of declaring we intend to re

granted lis, as there is now out on a cruise
17 fail of Algerine Corsairs, the leilt of which
II guns; betides a great number of brats
armed with swivels and mulkets, and each
boat carrying from 18 to 25 oien ; and fhoiild
we fill into their hands we have nothing to
expeCt but perpetual slavery, as, the Tyrant
of Algiers lias declared he wiil not raniom
an American on any terms whatever ; we
have intelligence daily from Algiers, and
learn that our countrymen there arc treated
in a crue land Clocking manner. Peace is
concluded on for 50 years between Portugal
and Algiers, and if we have not a Seet to
protect our trade we may expert the mod
serious consequences, as the Algerine Corsairs
have gÂ«ne to the Northward, and nave de
clared they intend Lo pay a vif.t to the Ame

under convoy of a PortUguese squadron.
Extract of a letter from the American Con
sul at Li/bort, to a mercantile house In
this town, dated Inarch 18âreceivedty
Capt. Perry.
" I have tht pleasure to inform you,
that there is every reason to believe tl)at
hostilities will lo n be renenewed between
Purtvgal and Algiers, and th>t the Al
gerires .vill of ctmrle be flint up in their
ports again, and our navigation be o,iee
more free from those pirates, though not
fromfome others much more injurious to
our jeneral commerce. This court has
sent a Â£1 igate to Algiers, to inform the
Deythat they will not ratify the Truce,
and will never pay them any thing for
a P<ace, being able and determined to
(irotrft their own Tifade and Coast. But
at the fame time I hope the United States
will lend them some Aid, it being at least
a,; much for oilr Advantage as for that of
Portugal, that the Algcrines Ihould be
contned."
The following Algerine Cruizers were
out the 23d or March, vis. four Frigates,
of 44., 38, 32 and 28 guns; two Brigs,

ing ctjmmenced.
The ihip Betsey, Capt. William Page,
of thit port, arrived Yeilerday at New

SALEM, Massachusetts.
AN AGREEABLE FACT.
Last evening, the schooner Polly, Samuel
IngerfoH, malter, arrived here r'rom Domi
niqje. She, -with other American vessels,
fell into the hands of the British, at Trinity
(Martinique) and was sent to Dominique
for " legal adjudication where, after be
ing libelled, and fuffering plunder, and inju
ry lo the vessel, file has been finally given up
(whether with or without trial we did not
unlerftand) with 19 other vessels and the r
catgoes in the like predicament. âWe may
tiurefore hope, if the Bri'tifh have any fyf
tein of procedure, that those vessels which
fell into their hands at the other captured
French illands, will be alio released.âThere
was a flying report at Dominique, not cre
dited, of our Embargo. Provisions were
very low, and feiling at vendue for almost
nothing.
From the St. *fames's Chronicle.
An effectual method to prevent Mice from
eating the grijn in flacks, or mows, or
ebeeit, or other articles usually injured by
these vermin.
Mr. Macdonald of Scalpo, in the He
brides having before fuffered considerably by
Mice, put three or four stalks, with the leaves
on, of wild mint, gathered in a field near a
brook, at the bottom, near the centre, atid at
the top of each Hack or mow, as it was
railed, and never after had any of his grain
consumed.âHe then tried the lame experi
ment Ills eheefe, and other artcles usu
ally kept in llore, and often injured by mire,
with equal effect, by laying a few leaves,
green or dry, on the article to be preserved.
The experiment is easy to be tryed, and if
it proves generally effectual, is a valuable
preventative.

It is wholly unneceflary to expatiate on the
â¢dvantage.to American readers, that rhtsedi.
tion pofleires, over every imported edition of
any system of Geography extant. The arldit
Hon of maps of the feveralflate , procured a
a very great expense, and'from the bell ma
terials that are attaiuable, (peaks such full
conviction on this fuhjeÂ«, that it would be
diftefpeft to the reader's underftand.ng to
suppose it requisite to enter into a detail of
arguments to prove its superiority. In no
fim.lar work have such maps beenever i o tÂ»-
vttced.

j The Public are cautioned to
I htsware of counterfeited Five Dollar Bills of â 
the Bank of. the United States, and Ttuehty
Dollar Bills of the Bank as North America,
fe-veral of â â which have appeared in circulation
<witbin a few. days pajl; they- are a good ge
neral imitation of the genuine Bills, but may
be difiingui/hed by tlx following
MARKS.
rinje Dollar Bills of the Bank of the
i - United Slates.
ALL that have appeared have the letter F.
for their niphabetical Mark.
Tiie Texture of the Paper is thicker. and
* winter and it takes the ink-more freely
tlie genuine -paper.
The O. m the word Company is fmaiJei;**
than the M. and other letters ofthat wort.], '
so that a line extended from the top of the Q,
to touch the top of the M. would extend con-,
fiderably above the range of the whol*? word.
l/i the word United the letters .ire nariow
erandcloler together than the rei\ o( the bi'll
The i and fin the word promise are not
parallel, the much more forward
than the j.
The engraving is badly executed,the fttokes
of all the Letters are lironger and the devi< e
in the margin particularly is much coarser and
appears darker than in the true bills. Some
et the counterfeits bear date in 1791âWhere
' as the Bank was not in operation till Decern
ber, and no five dollar bills were ifTued in
jhat year.
Twenty Dollar Bills of the Bank of North
America.
ALL that have appeared have the letter
B ior their alphabetical mark.
They are printed 011 a paper nearly similar
to that of the couuterfeit Five Dollar Notes
'above defcribedv the engraving is beitet exe
ucted* and they approach nearer to the ap
pearance of the genuine bills.
The fine ruled lines through the word Twen
ty, in the body Of Ihe bill, arc in number thir
teen in the genuine b lis, and but twelve in
the counterfeits.
The woi-d Company is much like the fame
word in the Five Dollar Bills defer ibed a
bove, the 0 being Jess than the to, and others
following.
There is rio stroke to the t in the word North
whereas in the genuine bills the itroke is weli
defined.
The letters tnt in the word Twenty 9 to the
left hand at the bottom, do not come down to
the line, but are l*o cut as to give an irregular
appearance to the word, the Tw and *.hey go
ing below them.
The Nixon, has the appear
ance of being written with lamb-black and
0.1, and di tiers from other inks used in
printing the bills and the calhiet's signature.
i It is luppofed these forgeries were committed
in some of the Southern States, all the coun
ter feus thai have appeared, have come from
thence, tÂ»nd tfco perious have been apprehend
ed in Virginia, on lufpicion of being the author
of them.
The Reward of ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS
will be paid to any Perlon or Perlons who ihall
difcovei and profecuie to con vision the ieveial
, offenders of ihe following delciiptions or any
of them, viz.
The person or persons, who manufa&ured
the paper on which the Bills are printed.
The per<ou or peifons, who engraved the
plates.
The printer or printers, of the bills.
tvery person who has a&ed as a principal in
r) any other way, in the counterfeiting and utter
ing the said bilis.

Other counterfeit bills
d of the Bank of the United States have appeared
in circulation.
r The denomination is of TWENTY DOL
LARS,and the alphabetical mark is the let
a ter B.
â  They may be distinguished fronj the genu
ine by the following MARKS f
The paper of the counterfeits is of 2c more
tender texture and glofley furface than the
genuine, and there is no water mark in them.
Tiae letter C. in the word Cashier, in the
true bills is strongly marked, whereas in the
counterfeits, the whole letter is a fine hair
stroke, evidently in an uofinifhed slate. The
letter a in the word demand, is badly formed
and the whole word ill done, is no
comma at the ehd of it, as there is in the
* genuine bills.
The marginal device, is mwch daiker in
3 the falfe, than in the genuine bills owing to
j the shade strokes being coarser, much nearer
together, and consequently much more nu
merous. This difference ft 1 ikes the eye at firft
view.
The fame reward of ONE THOUSAND
DOLLARS, will be paid for apprehending, iz
, prolecuting to convi&ion the several abvve
described Offenders in refpe& tp this, as to
the last described bills.
