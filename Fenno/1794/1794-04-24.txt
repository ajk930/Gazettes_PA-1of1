neither on himfelf nor connexions, is cau

pardonably indefinite hints to the public

clapped the National Seal on all British

they flopped all communications between

they uniformly made it turn out to the dis

They form a very striking contrast to the

"On the 24th, all the prisoners con"
fined here asfubjefts of Great Britain were
libeiated. On Christmas day I had. the
honor, with numbers of my countrymen,
of dining in company with one of the
commiflionersâwhen he addrefTed us in a
short but pathetic speech, assured us that
it was with the greatest relnclance the
National Convention found itfelf under
neceflity of adopting measures so repug
nant to their wilhes, but that from the vast
number of spies in France, such a mea
sure had become for a time in difpenfably
necefTary. He begged further to afiiire
us, that the firft neutral vessel which ar
rived in that harbor, should be hired for
the purpose of coÃvoying to their native
country, all fubje&s of G>reat Britain as
should wish tq. return.âNever were pri

NATfONAL CONVENTION,
Tuesday, Jan.'ji.
The Jacobins of Paris came to the Con
vention, and made a speech Â»n the anniver
' fary of the death of Louis the tyrant. ' Re
presentatives of a free people,' said the ora- I
tor, ' this day is the anniversary of the legal
death of a tyrant. So grand a day, which
recalls to Republican fouls an a<st ordained
by reason and by nature as the firll step to
wards the happiness of all human kinds
fhouldbe celebrated by every man who knows
how to estimate his own dignity. The So
ciety of Jacobin* with fouls that burn for
liberty, have in a mass consecrated this grand
day, to felicitate anew the true Mountain
eers, on the courage of whom as the organ
of the French people, they exterminated the
monster that devoured them. Tho Society
invites you, Mountaineers, to make a decree
that this anniversary (hall be regularly cele
brated and consecrated to liberty: continue
your labours with that firmnefs which be
longs to free men ; be the terror of the ty
rants of the glebe, and the hope of fuflfering
humanity. By and bye, through the exam
ple of Frenchmen, all nations will (hake off
the yoke r.nd break their fetters ; and then,
, if thefuhlime atchievement of a people, whpfe
organ you have the happiness to be, (hould
. serve as a model to all nations, your civic I
virtue and your courage (hall serve as a les
son to their representatives.
" There is no equality, no liberty, where
ther<S is a king ; there is no happiness without
liberty; you have destroyed a King, and
you have thereby (hewn your desire to efta
.Hifh equality and liberty, that is to fay, the
happiness of the people ; you have therefore
deserved well of your country."
AnfwÂ»r of the President.â" The anniver
sary of the death of a tyrant, which is a day
of glory to the French people, is a day of
terror and of mourning for despots and their
supporters.âThis memorable day announces
â¢ the re-y akening of a deeping people, and
the massive weapon of the revolution is rea
dy to crufli the monsters who hold nations
enslaved ; and the glorious Tree of Liberty
{hall not peri(h, while their impure blood
(hall nouri(h and fructify its root.
" Citizens, the feftival that you are go
ing to celebrate, ought to animate the cou
rage of the Sans Culottes, appease the manes
of the vi&ims maflacred under the flandard
of tyranny, and avepge human kind for the
outrages that they have fuffered for more
than fourteen centuries. It is on this day, it
is at this hour, that the head of a tyrant
fallsâit is before the statue of liberty that
you are going to found the last hour of
crowned freebooters, and all their satellites.
The National Convention will take into con
federation the petition you have made, and
invites you to the honors of the fitting."
These two speeches were ordered to be
sent to all the Popular Societies, to the De
partments, and to the Armies.
-Sort Louis, new named Fort Vauban.
is secured to us. Fort
Vauban is ours, said the corrupt emigrants
in their intercepted letters. Wait but a few
days, said the Committee of Public Safety,
in its last report on Landau, and the slaves
of Pruflia and Austria will no longer defile
our territory: the prophecy is fulfilled, and
Fort Vauban is at this moment occupied by
the troops of the Republic.
" Cowards are always cruel and destruc
tive. The banditti have disappeared like ma
lignant meteors. They have set fire to a
part of the Fort; have laid waste the vari
ous houses of the town ; have placed mines
in all parts, some of which are sprung and
have carried ofF the,cannon.
" Alfatia is wholly preserved; but the
Austrian, after ruining what he could not
preserve, has prudently put the Rhine be
tween himfelf and the French Republican,
We have loft houses and fortifications, but
ive have an invulnerable rampart, a Republi
can army. The place has not cost us a single
man, and according to fcientific men, the
recovery of Fort Vauban by liege, would
have been a loss qf j or 6000 men to the
state. We (hall rebuild the necessary Forts,
and as to houses, in fortified towns, they
have always been rather injurious than ufe
fui. Beside, what have we to regret for
places that either have the cowardice to in
"vite or to receive the enemy ?
" Do not imagine, however, though Aus
tria has avoided battle by cowardly flight,
that there has been no trial of patriotism ho
jiorable to the French soldier. The powder
> ntiagasdae* were undermined, and matches
were prepared through the whole town to
r , , bi â¢ * the habitations ; v but our brave vo
lunteers flew on ail fides and snatched up the
matÂ« lies, defpifmg danger, with ihoft admi
âº rable courage.
u the mal contents spread a
rumour that the army of the Republic had
been defeated at Worms. The enemy at
tempted to make a movement, but the Repub
licans loon recovered their position. Worms
[ is at present ours, where we have found im
mense magazines of corn, leather, and cloth.
" In common wars, after fuccefles so nu
merous, peace has been fought for and ob
i tamed. The wars of kings only san
guinary tournaments, the expences of which
were defrayed by the people, while tyrants
insolently aflumed all the pomp to them
selves: but in a war for freedom, there is j
but one means, that of exterminating def- j
pots. When the horror of tyranny, and the
inftin#.of freedom, have armed the brave,
they will only Iheathe the sword by dictating
peace. The coalition has harnessed twenty
one nations to the corps of defpoti'm, the
inhabitants of which still are {lumbering :
the people of England, Scotland, Ireland,
Holland, Hanover, Brunfwick, Hefle, Prus
sia, the Imperialists, Auftrians, Hungarians,
Bohemians, Belgians, Ruffians, Piedmontefe, j
Sardinians, Parmesans, Florentines, Romans, j
Neapolitans and Spaniards. To enumerate ;
them is but to give a lift of the vanquiflied.
" What campaign was ever more glorious, j
presenting as it does, the Spaniards and the j
English flying from Toulon, the Pruflians
beaten at the Mozelle, the repaf- '
ling the Rhine, and the Dutch chaced from
Dunkirk ?'
" Some voices however, already are heard
declaiming on the advantages of
What man of understanding, what lincere
patriot will dare to mention peace, without
dreading to compromise freedom ? Who
then will speak of peace ? Those who hope
to adjourn the counter revolution for fb\ne
months or some years by giving foreign na
tions and tyrants time to breathe,
their people, provision their magazines; and
recruit their armies.âWho is it that calls
i for peace ? Brunfwick, Cobourg, Pitt, Hood,
and Ricardos. The deceit is too grofe, for
it is our cowardly enemies themselves who
mduUrioufly difieminate this opinion, and
have the folly to hepe it will prevail.
" Let our popular societies seize every
means of developing the crimes of the Bri
tilh government, and of proving that its
minifier has familiarized national despotism,
and in a pompous manner has substantiated
the royal tyranny. It is the forms of this <
government, which you ought to destroy."
LONDON, February 7.
The French are making altonifhing ex
ertions to fit out their navy ; and fgr this
purpose, every seaman in France is'put in
a Hate of requilitfon !
Letters from the Continent, by the
Flanders mail of yesterday, bring the in
teresting intelligence, that the French have
re-occupied the important heights of Op.
penheim, and have pufted their advanced
posts within two leagues of Mentz.
On the other hand, the army of 32,000
men, intended for the siege of Fort Louis,
has polled itfelf before Manheim. They
.have brought up the heavy artillery jfod
pontoons, and batteries aieerefted, not
only for the purpose of bombardiug the
town, but of covering their paflage over
the Rhine.
The accounts of the demolition of Fort
Louis, ate true only in part. Two bas
tions, or rather diftinft forts, looking to
ward Alsace, having been completely de
stroyed ; but the French entered the toivn
withaftonilhing intrepidity, and werethere
in time to cut off the fuffees which led to
the powder magazine and the other works.
Our Letters from Basle, in Switzerland,
dated Jan. 30, fay, that aFrench gentle

I For the Gazette of the United States.
Mr. Fenno,
, To , brin S about a war, the ground must
be taken carefully. The people are irri
tated, but decidedly opposed to hostile
ineafures. Those who hunger and third;
X" b ecause they will hunger and
thrrft nil there is one, have a plain game
to play To irritate the people more and
m Â° re ' r tlme or an y relaxation on the
part of Great Britain ftiould be likely to
? ' e the genial rage, it must be heated
by some new fuel. It must be established
as a rule, that a man's patriotism is to be
meaiured by his fury. To ad against the
general movement is hard work, like row
ing agatnft a strong current: But to go as
the public is going, and to persuade them
o go alter, to find tliem angry, and to
exafpmte thsm up to a pitch to ast as
s well as threaten violent things, Is aot the
0 mod difficult thing in the world. From
words to blows is but one stage iti pafTion.
What was attempted la(t summer ? War.
What is iu train at this moment ? Look
! at the refolws of our factious Societies}
[ at the style of certain newspapers. There
is another place where the mod outrage
' ous language has been used. Let our pru
' dent thinking men examine the whole
of this way of proceeding, and doubt, if
they possibly can, that some persons, whom
it is n<St prudent to mention, intend to
have war: That others who perhaps do
not precisely fee what they arc about, are
joining the violent party and are getting
along towards hodilities a step at a time.
Thus we shall findourfelves in three months
at the edge of the pit, and wonder how
we came there. It is time, if it is not too
late, for real Patriots to take their Rati
ons, and to keep the violent paflions,
which are always the forerunners of war,
from taking the lead. Thus far the ef
fcdf of our newspaper and speech-making
and refoldtion-making rage on our own
citizens has been hinted at : but let usex
; tend our views. The tendency of many
: things that have been said, and of some
j few that have been a died, to exasperate
! the people of England so as to make them
run into a war in support of the unjust
j proceedings of their ministry, is felf evi
dent. What would the feelings of our
own citizens he if the newspapers of Eng
land, and the debates of Parliament were
as outrageous against our country, as their
proceedings in the Weft Indies have been
opposed to the principles of j lift Ice ?
Would it have been possible ta have kept
those who are now so violent, within any
bounds of neutrality ? Let our Farmers,
our Merchants, our Tradesmen who must
bear the burdens of the war, pay due at
tention to the movements of those who
seem to be so ready to make it.

The " Democrat," acknowledges the
receipt of an admonition in the Gazette
j of Wednesday, and proceeds to apply the
general doflrincs it contains. If the " ex
ercise of sovereignty engenders a <wi/h to
usurp," it certainly behoves the people to
watch over this unlucky human inclina
tion, unless it be proved, that it is unna
tural to the modefl spirit of aristocracy, or
the meek temper of men in office, and the
cxclufive property of democracy and equa
lity. And that those who quaff deeply
of wealth and power, are less liable to
" intoxication," than citizens abftra&edly
employed in discussing and disseminating
the principles of liberty.
The democrat in fad condolence, sensi
bly feels the truth of the position, " That
when secret combinations diredi the choice
of repiefentatives, the Republic ceases to
be free." Whether it is most pertinent
to the paper combination, or to the de
mocratic societies, the reader must himfelf
If to the former, then his
Ipirits revive up to the congratulatory
pitch, upon reading, Â« that Clubs are the
forerunners of reform in a bad govern
mentor in other words, that they tend
to reform, whatever is bad in government.
Thus applying the position, the Republic
" hasceafed to be free," according to the
principles of the paragraphs, and though
the Democrat, admires the foundation,

From the General Aduertifer.
Mr. Bache,
As the division in Senate refpetting Mr.
Jay s appointment has been publiflied with
unusual industry and with a view to conceal
the principles upon which it took place,* I
have procured and beg you to publifli the fol
lowing, which I have reason to believe will
explain the motives and juftify the conduct
of the minority to the fatisfaflion of all
true republicans.
th t T SVimc loVVing refolut!ons were moved in
to Ihr Re^ IV f'V That any communication
to the court of Great Britain which may at
this time beneceffary can be made through
anH TA" C Â° Urt With e l ual
and effect and at much less expence than by
Jh Vr e T S an Env Â°y Extraordinary ; and
that iuch an appointment is at this junAurc
inexpedient and unneeefiary.
2d. That to permit judges of the supreme '
court to hold at the fame time other offices
emanating from and holden at the pleasure
of the executive is dÂ«ftruclive of their inde 1
pendence, and to expose them to the Lflu- j
ence of the executive, is mischievous and Im
politic.
lam informed that a majority of the Se.
Bate appeared to be infentiment with this last
resolution, but the friends of Mr. Jay urged
that his delicacy and sense of propriety would
certainly induce him to resign his office of
chief justice when he lhould accept the o
ther, and no question was taken upon the re
futations ; but they went off, either by a pre
vious question or upon motion for postpone
ment, ip to 16, The minority ftippofed
that more was to be feared from Mr. Jay's
avarice than was to be hoped from his deli
cacy or sense of propriety. The event will
shew who werf right. The divifton was up
on the principles before stated, and not upon
the man, tho' cogent objeaions might have
been urged against him, particularly as hav
ing publicly and officially juftified Great Bri
tain in holding the polls and carrying off the
negroes.
* As the publication alluded to, origina
ted in this Gazette, it may be proper to fay
that the motive herefuggejled, never exifled
in the mind oj the publisher.

T0 the MA N ivhich appeared in the Dai

1794.
IF (lander, malice and falfhood make
up the character of a Man, then your
. publication is flamped with strong evidence
of the propriety of its signature.
If a bale r;ffeftat:on of benevolence, for
the purposes of private resentmentâis
the employment of detestable means to
obtain what you falfely fiippofe " a po
pular end," or if an attempt under the
veil of darkness to ruin a person who ne
ver injured you, are evidences of manhood,
then your title to it is indeed eftablilhed.
You have aimed at me a deadly blow,
the stroke now recoils, and your guilty
conscience will give it all the effect I
wish.
You have bellowed on me the hand
some appellation ofâ
" An avaricious catch penny fhewman,
" Tom Thumb, Esq.
" Keeper of the Guillotine,
" Keeper of beasts, &c. &c."
Poor pitiful offspring of billingsgate,
thou oughteft to have known that a keep
er of beasts is better than the bead who
is keptâfor had you had the recollection
of an ass, you might have known, that
this scurvy -barefaced abuse would com
pletely unveil you ; in all this you went
aftrny from the path hypocrisy dictated ;
you forgot yourfelf; you should have
swallowed your gall, and the world would 1
perhaps have taken you for an angel. 1 i
For you pray too in the darkâ" God
forbid ââ" Forbid it God of all mercy."
Very pious indeed, and probably had you '
at the moment given vent to the devout
feelings of your heart, and finilhed your
prayev, you would have added " forbid
that Tom Thumb, Esq. fiiall be any lon
ger the catch penny Ihovvmanâ-and O
grant, that sooner or later I may be the
keeper of the beasts myfelf."
The mod undifcerning mull perceive
that all your motives are not avowed ; â
some secret springs must actuate your ma
licious heartânothing else can account fol
your conduct, a certain constitutional ten
derness rtiay cause you to shrink back from
instruments of punishments but to this,
no rational man can impute your violent
abuse and overflowing spleen.
But with an effrontery peculiar to your
felf you have thought fit to traduce also,
the American character. You feerri to
fiippofe the good people bf New-York,
capable of being diverted by the fight of
the guillotine. But know fir, that this
instrument is viewed with horror, as eve
ry such instrument ought to beâThat it
leaves an impreflion on every /nind, unfa
vorable to the cruelty of penal laws, and
the inftiftion of sanguinary punishments :
This impreflion is a ufeful one in a coun
try where a reform in the penal laws is
much wished for, and capital punishments
are perhaps too frequent. But your idea
that humanity is in danger of being ba
nished from our citizens unless the guillo
tine is exhibited only in pictures, in mi
niature, or in paste board models, is wor
thy only of their ridicnle and contempt.
American principles are not to be shaken
by trifles, whatever you may fuppofc.
But you go on, to tell American citi
zens that " a dangerous spirit is creep
ing in among them"â' an insidious spi
rit.' If this is so, I hope indeed it is not
the spirit you have manifefted. You call
this ' art awful period.' But why all this '
alarm ? Alas, Gardiner Baker (the poor
mechanic you affected to difpife) has got
in a small private room the model of a
guillotine, large enough to strike off my
noddle ; and this he shows to every fiend
of his that particularly requests it ! 1 !
â' You think this a political decadence'â
â¢ a said presage of decaying morality'â
' an unbridled licence' and an attempt 'to
weaken the government.'
Alas, poor creatine, your friends have
reason to tremble for your intellects !
' Fret now and flatter yourfelf' as much
as you please, and dream if you like of
' air guns, guillotines; rattle snakes and
scalping knives'â' deformiiies, deleteri
ous plants and venomous animals.'

Interejling particulars of the Jiege of Mar
tiniqueâand the surrender of Fort Bour
bon, as publiftied in the St. George's
Chronicle and Grenada Gazette of March
28 th.
MARTINIQUE,
March 6. The batteries of the be
siegers being completed, to the number of
60 piecesâ
March 7. At half past four in the morn
ing, from the signal of a rocket from the
camp, a general attack began, and the
fire of all the batteries was directed upon
Fort Bourbon, which was vigorously re
turned by the besieged i-' towards night
the fire ceased upon all fides. On this
day the English had five men killed and
wounded from their own fault in their
batteries.
March 8. About 3 o'clock the fire be*,
gan very violently, but that of Fort Bour
bon weakened : towards the evening Sir
Charles Grey gave orders to fire only by
intervals : Fort St. Louis was cannonaded
and bombarded the whole night by the
gunboats and bomb-batteries.
March ()th. A general cannonade and
bombardment: at 5 in the morning a piquet
guard from Fort-Royal attacked the poll of
Lacofte, and was repulsed ; but being after
wards supported by the garrison of Fort St.
Louis, and some armed men from thetown,
thejr intrenched themselves under the walls
of the Hospital, and in this situation fought
till 10 o / lock: the British troops under a
croft fire from two forts, and of some can
non placed at the point of the Hospital, and
exposed to the mufquetry of the besieged,
displayed a degree of firmnefs and resolution
beyond all praile; the engagement was fi
nished by the effe&s of a n pounder placed
upon Morn Tartenfon, which drove the pa
triots from their intrenchmente ; the Engiifh
had some killed and wounded in this aition ;
the loft of the enemy is not yet known. Our
batteries,- to which an augmentation of four
mortars had been added, playing during the
whole engagement; the forts of the enemy
kept up a terrible fire, but fortunately with
out any mifchief j the reft of the day passed
more quietly ; the whole night a cannonade
and bombardment was kept up upon Fort
Louis both from the sea and land.
March loth. Little firing on either fide;
tie approaches were carried on, and the bat
teries of the befiegeu augmented ; iriforma
tion was received from a deserter, that the
bombs had done much damage to Fort Bour
bon : during the night the batteries were
almost silent, but the bombardment against
Fort St. Louis was cortftantly kept up ; the
sire-os the enemy became much weaker.'
March T ith. Little firing dnring the
night. The scaling of Fort-Louis was a
gitated at head-quarters : in order to ac
complish the establishment of a mortar bat
tery at the Poligon, two strong batteries
of cannon were formed, one upon Morne
Tartenfon, and the other upon the heights
of Viomenil; these two batteries were
manne4 by sailors. Mr. Daoule, the fam
ofis partizan, intrenched himfelf upon his
own hill, and refufed to surrender: 250
men marched againlt him, and conduced
liirn this day to St. Pierre's with some
of his accomplices, and a great quantity of
mnfquets and fide-arms.
March 12th. Little fire in the morn
ing, the reft of the day quiet; a flag of
truce was sent to Fort-Bourbon ; upon
his return the fire of the befiegeis upon
Fort-Bourbon and Fort St. Louis was
tremendous until the next day.
The army is in high spirits, in general
very few sick, killed or wounded.
St. GEORGE's (Grenada) March 18th.
After having been involved for a conside
rable time part, in a labyrinth of incoherent
reports, reQjedling the fate of Martinique,
we have at last the fatiafaftion of announ
cing its final surrender to the British arms.
This agreeable information was brought by
Capt. Holman who arrived here in the Fan
Fan lift night. The well directed and in
cessant fire thas had been kept up by the En
giifh batteries had so much damaged Fort
Bourbon, that it had 'jeen deemed practica
ble for some time palt to carry it by alTault ;
but from the certain knowledge that the be
siegers had that the mines of the enemy were
carried to a considerable diflance from the bo
dy of the place, it was not thought proper
to facrifice the lives of such a number of brave
men as must have perished, if the besieged
should fiave sprung them, which there was
every reason to be ieve w'ould have been done.
On the fide of the Fort next the town, the
natural ftr ngth of the place, and the protec
tion of Fort Louis, had been so much depen
ded on, that that fide was left without those
subterraneous works.
â The capture of Fort Louis therefore be
came an object nec eflary to pave the way for
the carrying bf Fort Bourbon. The former
was taken without any loft on Thurfday,and
the town of Port Royal with all the ship
ping in the Carenage, fell into the hands of
the Engiifh. This was an acquisition of great
value and importance. On Sunday, the ene
my received the last fummons,and on perceiv
ing the advantages the besiegers had gained,
and the advances they were making , agreed,
to admit a British regiment into the Fort to
remaih together with the French garrison till
the terms could be finally adjusted. The
sixth regiment accordingly marched in and
remained till Tuesday, when the Engiifh col
ours were hoisted, and the French marched
out with the honors of war, to the number
of 800, 200 of whom were whites, and the
remainder negroes and mulattoes. They are
all to be shipped to France.
Four hundred of the garrison had been
killed during the siege, and the works
were in a state of ruin.
The greatest part of the guns were
dismounted, the mortar beds rendered
useless, the buildings within the fort en
tirely destroyed, and the body of the
place filled with rubbish. The loss of
the British on the whole did not exseed
two hundred.
To the above information we are sor
ry to add, that a Captain whose name we
have not learned, charged with Sir Chailes
Grey's dispatches, was unfortunately
drowned, in attempting to go on board
the Blonde Frigate, appointed by the
Admiral to carry home the intelligence
for Government.
/ /
A summons has already been sent to
St. Lucia demanding the furrejoder of that
Island, which it is not expected" to make > s
any r?fiftance.
Guadaloupe is the next obj? ft to which
the operation of the forces is to be direct
ed.
General Roehambeau has it left to his
ele&ion to be sent either to France or A
merica, and it is believed that he will be
prudent enough to prefer the latter when
he considers the fate that commonly awaits
the Republican Generals when they fail
of fuiccefs.
