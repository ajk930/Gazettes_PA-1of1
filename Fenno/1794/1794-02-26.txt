Philosophical Lectures,

creation of the world to the prcfent time, &c.
He will begin this second course of Lectures
Febru ry 27th, at 6 o'clock in the evening, in
the Friends' grammar school room, 4tb street,
and will finifl) it in a month.âThe idea of it
wksTtigoeftid by fonie Ladies for the improve
ment of the sexâbut it is calculated for both
k-xes (of any age above childhood) whereby
they will discover a new world in nature,
concealed from others as a fine country is
from travellers in the night, and as the light,
and the appearance of ikature is from the
blind; this will be a new scene of enjoyment
and dettuht, as that of feeing is to one born
blind, and will teach them to acquire the pro
per use ot their faculties, as a child does that
of his limbs by learning to walk :âthis will
elevate them to a Plvlofophical region of sub-
I me enjoyments and rational pleasures, as
much superior to the pleasures anrl amuse
ments of others as a man is to a chifd in fea
ture, and which will endure the shock of ad
versity, and not fmfwk* them like others, in
afHiftion and old age ; as the nfe and end of
all real knowledge is practice and happiness,
this course will tend ro promote personal hap
piness, and fit for the duties of focirty, one
pnrt of it will be on the preservation of health
of body and serenity of mind, without which
riches can afford no enjoyment : those whoob

FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE
PARIS, December 2
Yesterday the Convention received ad
vice that the Republicans had obtained a
victory over the Piedmontefe troops, and
that they had taken their Camp at Mag
dalena, and also of a fruitlefs attack of
the Prussians on Bitche, from whom they
took 250 prisoners.
BRUSSELS, December 5.
Lad Saturday the French again made
a general attack on the Imperial frontier
polls, and they had the good fortune to
penetrate as far as Menin, from which
place the cannon placed on the ramparts
played on them, which made them retreat,
after having fifty men taken prisoners:
and we understand that in the diftrift of
Stunvoorden, the enemy are collecting in
great numbers; from which we judge,
that their design is once more to wrefl
from us Weft Flanders.
FRANKFORT, Nov. 26.
The plan of taking Bitche by furprifc,
or rather the Citadel, which would have
been a great acquiCtion, at it commands
the defiles, was attempted in the night of
the iGth, and miscarried. The town was
talily taken, and the Prussians even pene
trated in the zig-zag to the last gate to
wards the Citadel, vrfiere the French, with
balls, timber, stones, and boiling water,
forced the aflailants to retreat with the loss
of fcveral hundred men.

December 5,
The intelligence that lieutenant-colonel
Kitfchfeldt, adjutant-general to the duke
of Brunfwick had been killed, is without
foundation. He had a stone thrown at his
head near Bitche, which wounded him ' T
he is alive at Worms, whither he went to
wait his recovery.

taken place near Hallum and Werwick,
where ijomenof Laudon's free corpÂ»
were taken prisoners ; the firft inft. the
French had advanced to Ypres and Me
nin, nothing, liowever, took place, but
/light fliirmilhes, which were viewed as
the forerunner of a serious attack soon
taking place by the French; as they had
already retaken the post of Poperingen,
and that their army daily received consi
derable reinforcements.

By letters from Genoa, we learn, that
last week a great number of barrels, filled
with gunpowder, were found in Porto-
Franco, probably hidden there with the
wicked intention of blowing tip the great
magazines. On account of this manoeu
vre, an extraordinary Council was held,
the result of which was, an order for all
the foreigners to quit immediately the ci
ty and harbor of Genoa. This morn
ing, several ships, full of foreigners, ex
pelled from Genoa, arrived here.
The citizens of Marseilles have been
forced to enrol themselves in Cartaux's ar
my, being threatened with the guillotine
in cafe of refufal. No fooncr are the un
fortunate people put to guard the out
posts, than they take the opportunity to
desert hither. They affr.re us, that Car
teaux has not more than yeco effective
men, the greater part of whom are forced
volunteers. They ai e dreadfully circum
ftat â¢ed for want of provisions, and are o
bliged to live upon the fruits of the cli
mate.
Very few of them have tents to sleep
under.
Six thousand Portuguese are daily ex
pected.
PORTSMOUTH, Nov. 22.
By a Danifli brig which arrived here
this evening from Brest, we have the fol
lowing particulars :
The Thames frigate, Captain Cotes,
previous to being taken, had an aftiou
with a French 64 gun ship, arme en Jlute,
which struck ; but the Caramagnole fri
gate, of 44 guns, immediately coming up
a mod severe engagement took place, and
after having 44 men killed, a milch great
er number wounded, the Thames dismast
ed, and rendered totaHy unmanageable,
Capt. Cotes was under the necelTity of
striking his colours. Captain Cotes and
his officers are closely confined.
During the time the Dane lay at Brell,
the Thames was completely refitted, man
ned, and ready for sea. A (loop of war
had likewise brought in 5 English coalt
ers with good cargoes, one of them be
longing to Liverpool. The day this brig
failed from Brest, a fleet confiding of nine
fail of the line and 3 frigates put to sea
but their deftiuation was not known.
There were besides in Brest water, entire
ly ready for sea, 14 fail of the line, two
of them three deckers, and ten large fri
gates, that were expected to join the a
bove fleet.
FALMOUTH, Nov. 30.
This afternoon about j o'clock, arriv
ed here a French frigate called La Blonde
mounting 28 guns. The Blonde was cap
turedby his Majesty's frigate, the Phartcn
commanded by Sir A. S. Douglas. It is
reported that the Photon fired one broad
side only into La Blonde, whereupon
the Sans Culottes immediately struck.

Prejidenf s Birth-Day!
F AIR rife the morn that gave our hero birth,
And with it peacc descend to bless the earth,
Fiy diicord tar iro.n these cnlijjhtcn'd fhorc:
Let not fell Ate with defti unlive powers,
Shed one malignant ray.
But let the loves and all the graecs comeâ
Let Nature smiling ftied a rich perfume,
And antedate the Spring.
With myrtles crown'd fair Freedom lia.il the
morn,
On which your friend, our much lov'd Chief
was born,
And all ye Muses sing.
Let venal bard 9 a despot's brow adorn-
In every wreath they find the rugged thamâ
And praise, a fittire proves :
But our bright liieme will make the garland
shineâ
To sweetest flowers his virtues we combine,
And add to thoseâour loves.
What noble qualities enrich his inind â
His ardent zeal his policy refin'dâ
His watcbfulnefs and careâ
Where'er his Country needs a faithful guard*
No dire event can find him unprepar'd,
For arls of peace or war.
When savage herds invade our fertile plains,
And undiftinguilh'd scalp the peaceful swains,
His energy is seen.
Colle&s the warriors from their rural home,
Their long negle&ed helmets they affane,
And peace is heard again.
When ancient nations past their zenith, drive
To that fix'd point, at which they mujl arrive,
And? all their glory cloud â
Contending armies croud the enfangui iiM field,
Their glittering arms are seenâthe sword,
shield
And garments roll'd in blood.
Or. Nature's theatre, almost alone,
Columbia fitting on a peaceful throne,
Reclines her beauteous form
Upon the boibm of her favorite Son â
Sets him compleat the work which he begun,
And tarn the impending fiorm.
Long m .y this bright aufpiciai;s dar sp ;?ar
And gild with lucid rays our hcmifpbere,
Reflecting on his breadâ
That confc'ions pi ace, that ever must arise
From t'oodnefs, ufefulnefsand greatemprize,
Bv which his Country's blefs'd.
And when the Arbiter of life and death,
ShaHTend his Angefto demand his breath,
And speed his heavenly flightâ
May 1 wimble hope and sacred joy iraparty
Streams of ccleil al pleasure to his heart,
Incommunicably bright.

For the Gazette of the United States.
Mr. Ff.n-no,
Whilst I pay my tribute of applause to
Critos' happy choice of a fubjedfc of ani
madverfiea i.i your Gazette of Thursday,
I am captivated with his much admired
' taste and fentirtient,' and feel something
irrefiftable to participate his sober ideal,
as well as to join him in the lift of those
doughty Champions of Virtue, denomina
ted Reformers of the Age: But when I
look round and view the rapid strides of
of Sinânay, witness even the Wicked
ness of many, who under the malic of a
Samaritan, cover the measure of their
own iniquities, and uncharitably attribute
to others the causes of lue objeÂ£t of their
vehemenceâthe prof gacy of the times. I
fay, when I thus view such a picture of
human hypocrisy, I cannot withstand
an lioneft indignation, that such men
there are, who from the shrines of their
devotion yell again ft vice and immorality,
and from the irrafcibility of their style,
defeat their own virtuous purposes. Such
Sir, are the means now purfwed to disturb
the tranquility of Society, and to cast an
odium on those, who cannot confeien
tiou.Oy participate another man's opinion.
To revert more particularly to the fub
jeft in question, that of Theatric Exhi
bitions ; and though not a regular fre
quenter of what Crito terms ' those mad
scenes of pleasure,' I confefs, I should
prefer an amusement, where Vice and Vir
tue are so feelingly contra (led, to the Mad
Ravings of a Pulpit Orator. To render
Virtue amiable, is to {hew Vice in its
moil odious colours.
Ckito \vould do well, firft. to appease
the irrmiibility of hia feelings, before he
attempts to work his miraclesâand (hould
boi-fiiiutious how he criticises those, whom
he niggardly presumes, " knows but little
of the \vovW or of human nature." Be
lize me Sir, I have witnefled 4< The
" Wrath of HrafexJ* ar.d have seen
u thole mournful scenes" Crito so
tragically depicts.âPeace be to the manes
of our deeeafed Brethrenâpersuaded we
all feel an equal sorrow for departed worth
so valuable while living. Contrary to
Crito, I animadvert not on words, keep
ing in mind, " that ten censure wrong, for
one who writes amiss."
Crito, lias thrown the gauntlet âit is
taken upârecommending however, more
moderation in his ciitical attacks on the
style of his purile opponents, as he should
be aware that the trifling of phrases and
perverting their original meaning to Jinifler
purposes, render his arguments futile, till in

For the Gazette of the United States
A. B's Farewell to Gracchus,
GRACCHUS is so accufcomed, per
haps, to a pack, that he can hardly de
tach the idea of a literal patteboard-card
from the figurative application of that
word, to a certain species of writing.â
With people of common science and morals
his pun is ioft.
A. B. is glad to perceive that Gracchus
has " feelings" though they be of a " ple
beian" or coarse description. It is a
symptom that he is nbt quite so callous,.-.3
unprincipled minds usually are: Yet it
would seem by the Jlyle and complexion of
his billet that he has attained to a conside
rable degree of impenetrability.
He afierts falfeliuod with as much cafe,
as if be had been bred to its profeffional
exercise ; and with an impudence peculiar
to himfeif, has Hated that A. B. has re
traced, what Gracchus calls, the error of
his firfl: publication. A single proof of
this, would have been worth a dozen of
aflertions ; the one, however, cost no la
bor, the other would have been a Hercu-
lean tailc.
He also very morlrftly declares, that there
is now, no difference of opinion between
himfrlf and A. B. who, if he means any
thing, mnfl mean- I coincidence in fentr
ment with him. One can easily fee that
he has been tifed to his trade, and hopes
by bold-faced impertinence to impose up
on the Jury, that is to decide upon the
point in difpnte.
I
fft the learned explanations which Grac
hus condescended to give, in his firft re
jly to A. B. upon the article fovereigntv,
we find the following aflertion ; "as the
people delegate a PO RTION of their fo
ver- igr.ty, that body which has the legj/lative
power is the sovereign for them" When
ever he will be so good as to shed a little
of his light upon this sentence, and ex
plain " what part of the sovereign for the
people the legislature is," it, will greatly
assist A. B. in the solution of a question
which Gracchus proposed.
In the mean time as Gracchus lias tak
en his leave, perhaps to accompany his
Client, as A. B. advised, he is recuefted
to present the compliments, of the fiiends
of order and good government in Amcri
sa, to the influential leaders in the Na
tional Convention, with thanks for the
happy riddance which this country'lias ob
tained through their INSTRUMEN
TALITY, of two very troublesome in
mates.
ExtraH from the id. Volâ¢ of the Secret
Hijlory of the Green Rooms in the three
Theatres RoyalâLondon.
" Mr..Fennell" (of the New Theatre
in this city.)
" This gentleman is among the few
who have descended from genteel prof
pefts to the Stage, purely from inclinati
onâwithout the ftimulusof neceflity, and
in danger of offending very refpeftnble re
lations, he was impelled as it were by in
ftinft, to attempt the Bufl<in and made ap
plication to the Managers, without the
forms of introduction or the impediment
of fear.
" Mr. Fennell can bcaft of more ref
pettable connexions than the generality of
the sons of Thefpis. He was born if we
miftakc not, in Wales where his relations
now arc, who gave him a liberal educati
on and intended him for the Bar. He
came to London for accompliihment in
the law, but attention was diverted
from that pursuit by a predilection for th-
Drama. Anxious to try how tar nature
had quali6ed him for a profeffion for which
he felt such fondnefs, and at the farr.e
time anxious to conceal his passion from
his friends, he judged in so remote a place
as Edinburgh his attempt, if untiiccefsful,
would be buried in oblivion.â-He betray
ed his errand by fpcuting in his apart
mentâbut communed with none ot the
eorps : Mr. Jackson (the manager) was
ped'onally applied to, and our hero per
formed Jaffier, Othello, See. under the as
sumed name of CambrayâThe flattering
reception he met v.ith here induced him
to hope for general approbation in Lon
donâHe waited on Mr. Harris about the
opening of Covent Garden Theatre in 87,
without any introduction, and coming to
the point at once, he repeated two or three
fpeeehes so much to the fatisfaClion of hi*
auditor, that a night was instantly fettled
for him to make his debut.âEither from
a desire to conceal his countenance, or a
partiality for the part, he felefted Othello
for his entiee, and the encouragement
given to his fivft efforts, emboldened him
to drop the fable maflc and come forward
as Jaffier, Alexander the Great, &c. but
ftiil under the fictitious name of Csmbray.
In all those characters he was kindly re
ceived, and looked on as a very promising
theatrical candidate. But as his talents
did not create the admiration he widled
and expected, he thought it advifeable to
praftife in the country until his powers
were nearer maturity. The favor with
which his exertions hid been honored in
Edinburgh, pointed ont that city as the
moll genial school for his inftrucb'on ; but
he had scarcely renewed his former e{Â£i
mation before he was driven from that
stage ill the mod arbitrary, unjust, and
ungenerous manner.
DRACO.
The audience in Edinburgh think them
selves the moil feledt and judicious in the
world. The audience in London they
call an undifcriminating mobâsuch being
their sentiments, they instantly caughf fire
at the idea of an Englt/h Checld fur palling
their am clever col hint; and after calling a
numerous meeting they went to the thea
tre in a bod)', resolved to vent their indig
nation on Mr. Fennell. Whenever he ap
peared he was saluted with lulling, called
on to answer how he dared to take Jaffier *
from Mr. Wood, and loaded with the
most opprobrious fnve&iyes. He endea
vored to explain, but on hearing a zealot
stigmatise him in the nioft odious language,
his feelings as a man, were so put to the
quick, that he replied, " The person who
fays so is a villain !" This afle.tion not
being generally undcrftood, gave general
offence ; and he was called on to make
fubmiflion, more humiliating if pcffible,
than that formerly requested of Mr. Jas.
Aickin which he refufed complying
with, and in consequence was forced to
quit the Hage.
Though the arbitrary and ilhbetal body
of lawyers became his bitter enemies ; vet
the unprejudiced inhabitants of Edinburgh
thought him ffiamefiilly injuredâThe {lo
ry spread not only through Scotland, but
England and Irelandâit was unive'fally
talked of and the irascible Caledonians
were universally execrated. Every one
felt for Mr. Fennell, and wished to fee his
wrongs redrefled. Finding so many
friends, and finding jufticc so much on his
fide, he brought an aflion against the ring,
leaders for depriving him of his livelihood,
but here he found himfelf in an aukwatd
predicament To the eternal disgrace
of that country not one advocate could be
found to plead his cause, though it wns
well known to be a good oneâuntil Mr.
Charles Hope and another gentleman ftriod
forth his champions, rather than not res
cue Scotland from the ignominy of being
destitute of advocates to plead the cause of
an opprefTed individual.âBut as Sir Hai
ry Wildair fays, " it is hard to contend
with a man in his own profeffion," for lif
ter profccuting the oonfpirators with all
pofable rigor near 12 months, he found
himfelf as distant from redress as when I c
firft began.
" He afterwards performed a few night?
in York, and obtained an engagement ft
Covent Garden last season, when lie peU
formed very feldonii
" In. his person lie is the tailed on t'ic
stage ; he is handsome!)- formed i his faiv,
too, is well adapted for the Diama, and
his voiee is powerful r.nd melodious, and
his eloquence lofty, and fouorous."

Coilot D'Herbois. " Dispatches are
received by the committee of Public Safety,
informing it, that America has permitted
French veiTels to fell in their ports all
English prizes which they might make.
On a close examination of these dispatches
it appears, that although they carry official
marks, they are not from the American
o-overnment; bnt merely from a consul of
one of the Anglo-American cities, who
being nothing but a commercial agent,
and not a political one, may very likely
have written them from interested motives,
rather than authentic authorization. Ne

When the news firll arrived, it was not
credited ; but before his departure, there
was not the least doubt of its being true,
as confirmations, from various quarters,
had been received at Guernsey. The Eng
liih on their leaving the harbor, set fire to
several fail of French veflcla, not being
able to take them off.
He likewise confirms the account of
General O'Hara, with the men under his
command, having been taken, some days
before the Recapture of Toulon.

1792. The effects contained in his chest

This bill provides for granting a sum of
money which was due to her late husband
Thomas Clark deceased, for public fcrvi

whose time in the public service a bond

The bill was opposed, as contravening

door to innumerable other claims now bar

It was supported as providing for a
