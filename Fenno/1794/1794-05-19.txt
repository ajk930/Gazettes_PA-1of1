From the Philadelphia Gazette.
The following it the fuhjlanct of the obfer- 1
â¢vations made by Mr. Smith, (S. C.J
on the Non-importation Billy in the House
oj Representatives of the United States.
Mr. Smith was opposed to the measure
becaufc it was inconsistent with that fpi
nt of negociation which wa6 contempla
ted not only by the Executive, but by
Congrcfs; for although some members
fecmed averfc to any further attempt at
negociation, yet it was evidently the wish
of a considerable majority to give it ano
ther trial.
The measure carried with it a menace ;
it held out this language, ".That unless
Great Britain would consent to certain
measures, the United States would pun
ilh her by certain other measures."
This language had a direst tendency
to defeat all negociation, for no nation
would ever treat on such terms: Even
were Great Britain disposed to make
compleat fatisfaCtion for every injury, her
pride would restrain her from making
concessions which might appear the re
sult of threats and apprehenlions.
This had been compared to the cafe of
an individual, and it had been shewn that
in common life, no man of'fpirit would
make atonement for an injury, when it
was demanded with a threat of punishment
if withheld. Mr. Smith applied the cafe
to ourfclves ; he brought it home to the
feelings of the members themselves, and
he alktd if they, under fimilarcircumftan
ces, either as private or public characters,
would not from a lpirit of national pride,
spurn at the idea of having redress extort
ed by menaces ?
Great Britain would be disposed to
make or withhold reparation according to
events in Europe, and according to hef
<if :''y a~K-'^*n(T" a , â
resulting from a was with the United
States.
By that view would her answer be go
verned ; Should the cabinet of that nati
on hesitate with re.'pest to peace or war,
a measure like this would undoubtedly de
cide them against peace; their language
would naturally be, we were disposed to
accomodate all differences on the moll ami
cable terms, but such a disposition under
the present circumllances would appear to
be the result of fear excited by your
threats, and commit our reputation in the
eyes of all the world ; you mull therefore
pursue your measures and we. (hall pursue
ours. Mr. Smith a Iked whether this
would not be the language of every nati
on in a like iituation ; he was persuaded
it would be ours. There was nothing
pusillanimous in asking reparation in de
cent terms, unaccompanied with threats.
It was the common pra6tice of all na
tions ; Genoa had recently, though her
neutrality had been violated and her port t
blocked up,fent an envoy extraordinary to
Great Britain to demand fatisfa&ion ; her
demand was couched in mild and civil lan
guage ; yet Genoa was universally ap
plauded for the firmnefs and the dignity
of her condu& as a neutral power. It was
not enough to fay that we had been grossly
infulted,this was admittedinitsfu'.left extent
but every nation when it required redress,
was previously insulted ; the very demand
of fatisfa&ion implied antecedent injury : ,
Nations however negociated without
threats.
Why then did gentlemen so frequently
cry outâWhat, shall we negociate with a
nation which has violated our rights ? He
would ask those gentlemen when negocia
tion was neceflary, but in the cafe of vio
lated rights ? He would further ailc them
whether they were not the firil to urge
negociation with the Dcy of Algiers, who
had captured our veflels and degraded our
miserable fellow-citizens to the level of
beads of burden ? Whether they did not
oppose the naval aimament, lell it Ihould
irritate the Algerines and prevent the fuc.
cess of negociation ? Was it not the con.
ftant policy of this country to negociat eÂ»ith the Indian; when practicable _ rather ]
than to make war with iM'm ? Why then j
raise objections to a ncgociaticu with Eng- ,
land! or why after having adiliitted that (
negociatiofi shall be attempted? 'dcfc.it it by
theft projects ? I
It a majority of the house are ripe tor
war, let us frj'fo, and *61 tontft.-iitly; but
let us not hold one language at one time,
and contradict it at another. Let us not fay
â wâ¬ are for peace and immediately adopt a
war measure. ' â 
Mr. S. inferred front tjfefe obfervatioris,
that negociation being determined on, he
was bound to refill any and every a& which
tended to fruftrÂ«ite that negociation.-
x But whj he was thus for the juavitcr in
moda, he' was. at the iiime time for the forti
trr in re, and he called upon the advoca es
of this scheme to join him in those mcaft.rcs,
which at the fame time that they werefiee
from the'foregeng 0b,.-tions, would, iu his
opinion, either give efiette the negociation,
or prepare lis for the event of its fai'uPe.
\ gcitleatan had said, a we have foitifi
ed our harbours, we have filled our arsenals,
we have tnereafe d the military eilabLJhment,
now we inuft d 6 something more." But
the gentleman, in the warmth of his imagi
nation, lead raifuken things Vo be done, for
tlcing" actually done. Ihe fact was, that
tiie gentleman was entirely unbounded in all
t'hefe alflrtions. We have not fortified our
harbours, we have not iupplie<t"our arsenals,
vt. have not augmentc J our military strength.
'Tis true we have it all on paper, but the
very reittues necessary for the existence ot
all those rffential points, arc not yet reported
by the committee of ways and means, and
until those revenues exist, the laws we have
paflcd will be of little ava 1.
It was propo* -d by the law, that the non
importation fliouid not taice' effect till No
vember next,. a;;d that diflant period was (
fixed for its oper ition, to afford time tor the
reftilt of the negotiation, and that Congreis
night previouf.y be iiifeilion, in order to re
peal the law if the negociation should fac
cetd. Thus, while the very law itfelf ad
mitted she propriety of a negociation, it car
ried with it the very death wound of all ne
gociation, by exprefslv purporting to be in
tzrroriri. if it was not intended as a threat
why not \v::it till November*, and then adopt
tire'meafure, if" expedient Suppose this house
should, in November, deem the measure in
expedient, they can't repeal it wifheut the
concurrence of the Senate , and Prefcdent;
thus they foreftal the judgment of the house,
and deprive themfeiv- of that independence
which they oug'l t to poi'.^is, to act in the
next fefiion according to their then view of.
things. !' i ? * f, â¢
Some members had propoftd the ill of
November, in order to ac'mit the
but if that was the drfign, the period would
- ât~-Â«T-;T l TprT7fre-i âtrnrj-fm- -k"wnoW"- be v ex
tremely unequal in its operations; in some
of the Hates, the fall vessels -plight generally
be arrived by that time ; but in some of the
fouiherri dates, they would be generally ex
cluded, and those states deprived of their ex
pected supplies. â 
He further objected to the measure, on the
grounds of its dictating the terms of nego â¢
cintion, which was not within the province
cÂ£ this lioufe, and was therefore interfering
with the executive, and so far a departure
from the spirit of the conftitut'ejn ; but this
ground having been fully <lifcufieck by other
members, he (hould not dwell on it.
One member had expressed an affection -
for this measure, because it was as he had
termed it, a Jlepping Jione to fequejlration ;
Mr. S, thought it would be more properly
called a Jhonbling block to negociation ; he
disapproved of it in both shapes. He ob
jected to it, both as to the mode in which it
appeared and as tQ the tiYne ; as to the mode,
because it fpecified particular grievances, and
thus while it embarrafled our executive, it
menaced the executive of the nation with
whom we were to treat, and made the re
dress of those fpeciftc grievances the fine qua
non {>f all future intercOurse; as to the
time, because as it was not to take effect till
the next session of Congrels, there could be
no other view in passing it now but that it
might operate as a threat, and as this inten
tion could not be millaken, it would un
doubtedly defeat all accommodation.
Such being his view of the subject, he
could not reconcile it to his duty to vote for
it. He thbught Congress owed it to their
constituents to avoid a war, if pofTible : The
ground of negociation being taken, they
were bound to reject every measure which
might have a tendency to defeat it, and to
do every thing which might give it a fair
chance v of futcefs. But while he said this,
(as a neutral nation could nbt justly give
umbrage by taking measures to support her
neutrality and assert herjuft rights) he pledg
ed himfelf to- concur in every act which
might place us in a condition to make our
selves respectable, to vindicate our national
honor, and to obtain ample retribution for
any wrones which the course of events might
leave unrydrefled. - .

Young Ladies,
It is row about fix years ftnee on an occa
fton similar to the present I had the honor to
deliver in Mr. Brown's academy my senti
ments on the fubjedl of education, and to
bear my teftiinony in praise of the rapid
progcefs the arts and fcienjts were making
among us. You may easily imagine that it
is with peculiar fat : sfaflion, that after such
a !apfc of time I return to this place to pur
sue a f?vorite fubjedl of contemplation, and
to welcome in among the elegancies of sur
rounding nature, the superior attra<slioiis of
polilhed manners and of an improved civili
zation.
V. hen J think for a nhoment on the close
of th last year,.the difnial fctnes v.'ilh which
the autumn was peculiarly marked, the very
e-xtinairn of hope that seemed visible on the
faces of some of orj countrymen, what mull
be the tide of exultation at feeing once more
revive, amid all the pomp and luxuriance of
the opening year, the charms of health, and
of that health, devoted to augment the sum
of general happiness.
rile veiy rapid improvements of which
the trrittees are now vvitneffes flatter the
mote as they are only fynonimous with e
qual advances which our contry is gradual
ly experiencing in her public prtifpe&s.
Our citiesjK'cnijie ..more embellished, nnr
rroads improved, our communications in
land opened, our code of laws foftened
and meliorated, our charitable and ufeftil
eh..hliihnlents augmented and the general
Welfare of America promoted jufl in pro
poitioo as you ladies unfold the dawn of
that early lfeill and industry, the effects of
vhich aie to call fc bright a colouring on
succeeding years. '
Ambitious of profit from all European
patterns, America is still riling to an eleva
tion above them, from her zeal to carry
her improvemnnts more and more forward
towards the goal of perfedion. In Eu,
lope we hear indeed of famous* universi
ties and of literary honors conferred there
in, but these fcem demoted to one sex
alone, while in our country, the ladies be
come fairly our rivals, if not our fupe
nors in all the graces of education, and
bear away their diplomas like ours of pro
ficiency and of excellence in the various
branches of polite learning.
How important is the' consideration
n, Â°" W be tlie cafe > tl,a ' &ch
should be the care of female minds when
It is confide,-ed that they are probably to
give the calling complexion to the future
generations of America, into whose in
fant minds they will not fail to instill a full
value for the treasures for which they have
thcmfelves betn candidates, and into whose
youthful bosoms they will never omit to
ingraft that continued flock of patriotic
ardwtir for the equal rights and privileges
of roanifor which to the honor of the pre
ient age we have feeii it the avowed ad
locate, and for which'their own progeni
tors acquired such an immortality of fame
by the fuccefsfiil defence.
Happy, ladies, to be born in an age
ot such great attainments in which the
human mind is daily exerting itfeif in new
acquilitions of important .knowledge. In
which our peculiar country lias' pledff
fl 'i n lts n conft; ti"ioÂ«al act, that
schools (hall be eflablifhcd throughout the
e. 'B which, the poor shall be taudif
gratis; m which the care of etihYhteninrr j
and informing the citizens is made the
obligation and duty of the rovem
ment, and >~ which every specie, of igno
rance and barWm is generally cxplo
f r , )rl " ma y y ou I've as ornaments
of Mi an age and of such a country, the
k ll and the afyfum of the human
r raee to which nothing can more contribute,
e than the care, industry, and. zeal with
I which you Jiave pursued your studies, and
j for which the trullees have juit now a
wardea premiums to those who have ex
, celled ; rewards intended rather to excite
emulation, than to convey censure on
those who. do not receive them, lince it
is not doubted but such as may have now
fallen (hort'in this refpeet, will soon, by
superior diligence, become more fyccefsful
candidates for equally flattering difliuc
tion in future.

CIIRiSTIANbTJED, (St. Croix) April
26.
On Thursday last came to anchor here,the
j Eriglifh frigate Rose, of 18 guru, Captain
| Scot. On the next day, the Quebec frigate
of 36 guns, Capt. Rogers, and Bull Dog
sloop or" War, Capt. Browne, appeared oft'
this harbourâcaptains Scot and Rogers came
on shore. It is said these ships are in puri'uit
of .3 French vessels, that had made their cf
cape from Gaudaloupe with an immense
treasure, after the surrender of that ifl:md :
which we learn for certain took place on Sun
day last. Morne Pal jiieft was carried by
ft..rm. We hear that 'the English loft feve
rel hundred of their troops at the reduction
of this island ; at Point Pot re, the French
men liad struck tiieir colours, and the Engliih
troops had formed themlelves in order t-i en
ter, and take poireffion, when, the French
opened thcir, batteries again upon them, and
killed upwards of 100 men. The seamen
enraged at this, rushed on,with great imoe
tuolrty, and immediately ftorrried the carri
fon, which they carried with little or no loft.'
Upwards of-ijo Frenchmen were put to the
sword.
The Rose got under way yefterdav about
noon. Captains Rogers an.l S?ot embark- I
in the evening. Tliel'e ihips of war were
seen this morning llretching to the N.

- tion that we believe authentic That
a packet had arrived at Barbadoes in 18
days from England, bearing" orders for cal-'
s ling 1,1 nil privateers, and restoring all A
merican vessels and cargoes. All British
1 port* are opened,and French ports all de
' clar*3 to be in a (late of siege. On the
1 arrival of these orders, a British frigate was
1 lent to blockade Aux-Cayes. This news
' was received at the Leeward before the
â¢ Captain failed. He favv this iirtelligence
in the Jamaica papersâand he also saw
London papers brought by the packet.

r " 0,1 arrived here the sloop
Independence, Thomas Young, mailer,
from Philadelphia. What her real buff
l 7 re ,s ' ,\ ve do not pretend to know ;
but, (lie is said to belong to Mr. Fitzliim
mons, a member of Congiefs, who by his
influence obtained permifiion to let her
come here to take away any American
lcamen that may wiih to return to Amer
ica, who belonged to any of the condem
ned vessels, &c. &c. The opinion on the
Continent was that a thousand or two of
them were here flawing and Withont
friends ; but the fact is, that only two or
three W American vessels have been con
demned here, and the crews have not heer,
obliged to wait a week-after, as there are
continually American or British, vessels
fading out from hence to the Continent or
the V\ eft Indies, none of which rcfufe
them a palfage. This sloop brought 110
cargoâAt the time she left Philadelphia,

The Public are cautioned to
beware of counterfeited Five Dollar Bills of
the Batik of the United States, and Twenty
Dollar Bills of the Bank of North America,
fe-veral of which have appeared in circulation
within a few days pajl; they are a good ge
neral imitation of the genuine Bills, but may
be dlftinguifhed by the following
M A R K S.
Five Dollar Bills of the Bank of the
United States.
ALL thai have appeared havs the letter F.
for their Alphabetical Mark.
The Texture of the Paper,is thicker and
whiter and it takes the ink nlore freely than
the genuine paper.
The O. in die word Company isfmaller
than theM- and other letters of that word,
so that a line extended from the top of the O,
tÂ» touch the top of the M. would extend con
siderably above the range of the whole word.
In the -word United the letters are narrow,
crand closer together than thsreft of the bill
The i and/in the word promise are not
parallel, the /inclining much more forward
than the i.
The engraving is badly cxecuted.the strokes
of all the Letters are stronger and- the devi. e
in themargin particularly ismuch coarfcr and
appeal's darker than in ihe Hue bills. Some
ai the counterfeits bear date in 1791âWhere
as the Bank was not in operation till Decern
bÂ«r, and no five dollar were ill ued in
lhat year.
Twenty Dollar Bills of the Bank of North
America.
ALL that have appeared have the letter
B. for their alphabetical mark.
They are printed on a paper nearly similar
to that of the couuterfeit Five Dollar Notes
above described ; the engraving is bcitei exe
ucted, and they approach nearer to the ap
pearance of the genuine bills.
The fine ruled lines through the word Tmen -
ty, in the body of the bill, are in number th.r
teen in the genuine bills, and but twelve in
the counterfeits.
The word Company is much like the fame
word in the Five Dollar Bills as defer ibed a
bove, the 0 being lels than them, and others
following. t
There is no stroke to the t in the word North
whereas in the genuine bills the stroke is well
defined.
The letters cnt in the word Twenty, to the
left hand at the bottom, do noi come down to
the line, but are so cut as to give an irregular
appearance to the word, the Tw and 'hey go
ing below them.
The signature J. Nixon, has the appear
ance of being written with lamb-black and
01, and differs from other mTU used in
printing the bills and the calhjer's signature.
It is luppofed these forgriies were commuted
i ill fomc of the Southern States, as all the coun
terfeits thai have appeared, have come Irom
ihence, and two persons have been apprehend
ed in Virginia, on lufpiciau of being ihe author
of them.
The ,eward of ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS
will be paid 10 any Foj lon or Persons who Ilia 11
discover and profecutc to conviction the teveial
offenders of the following or any
of them, viz.
The person or persons, who manufactured
the paper on which the Bills arc printed.
The perfoo or perlons, who engraved the
plates.
The pririter or printers, of the bills.
Kvcry person who has aÂ£led as a principal in
any other way, in the counterfeiting and utter
ing the said bills.
Philadelphia, March 28, 1794
April 22, 1794,
Other counterfeit bills
of the Bank of the United States have appeared
in circulation.
The denomination is of TWENTY DOL
LARS.and the alphabetical mark is the let-
B.
They may be diftinguiflied from the genu
ine by the following MARKS :
The paper of the counterfeits is of a more
tender texture and glofley furface than the
genuine, and there is no water mark in them.
The letter C. in the word Cashier, in ihe
true bills is strongly marked, whereas in the
counterfeits, ihe whole letter is a fine hair
stroke, evidently in an unfinifhed state. The
letter a in the word demand, is bac ly lormed
and the whole word ill done, and tiiere is no
comma at the end of it, as there is in the
genuine bills.
The marginal device, is much darker in
the falfe, than in the genuine bills owing to
the (hade strokes being eoar iei, much nearei
together and confequentiy much more nu
merous. This difference strikes the eye at firfi
view.
The fame reward of ONE THOUSAND
DOLLARS, wi)l be paid for &
prosecuting to conviction the several abov<
described Offenders in to thi:;, as tc
; the laftdefcribed bills.

'"pHEgrand principle of Equality, if right-
A ly understood, is the only basis 011 which
umverfal justice, (acred order, and perfect

the outrages ot opprcijion ; confirn 9, in the
molt forcible manner, the necessity of fubov
dinat o t, and the just demands of law ful au
thority. So far indeed, from loosening the
bands of society, that it maintains inviolate,
every natural and every civil diftinftion,
draws more clo/ely every social tie, unites in
one harmonious and j'uftly proportioned sys
tem, and brings men together 011 the even
ground of the inherent rights of human na
ture, of reciprocal obli ation, and of a com
mon relation to the community.
