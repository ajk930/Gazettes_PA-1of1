Publilhed at Richmond.
Mr. Davis,
TO you is presented for publication,
the enclosed extiaft of a letter, of the 4th
instant, from a Philadelphia citizen, whose
life in the late war, when real objects were
at flake, exhibits incontrovertable testimo
nials of his love of country, his obedience
to the obligations of morality, and his per
' fonal military exertions in the cause of rea
son and of liberty.âl have introduced
this detail of the writer's chara&er, be
cause the inchoate palLonate proceedingÂ®
of one branch of an august body, detailed
by the public papers, and heightened by
private correspondence, which every mail
circulates through this state, manifeits un
equivocally that the spirit of internal dif
c6t d and foreign war, is affectionately es
timated by some deputies of a people, who
hold the peaceable occupations of the har
row and the plough to be the certain paths
to national weight and to individual happi
ness, and who did fuppbfethat ourconfti
tution general, and conflitutions particu
lar, afforded a positive warrantee of peace
and its blessings to them, which never
could be interrupted by the egotism and
passion of men, clothed with public au
thority, aided by the desperation of their
seconds, whose noise is become as disgust
ing, as is their courage to fight and pow
er to pay those who have courage to fight*
Whether we are to be deprived of the a
bundant blessings we poflefs, will depend
on those to whom our public concerns arc
entrusted. May the God of Nature en
due our Congress with wisdom, and by
his lpecial interposition, save our nation
from the menaced deep calamity, by in
spiring the Houfc of.Reprefentatives with
a recollection, that they are the trufteei
of a people who love religion, obey the
truths of morality, and lijle our Blefled
Saviour, believe peace among mankind to
be the highest grade of felicity allowed
to the human race.
the extract.
"OUR worthy friend, I ought to fay
father, from his gootlnefs to us, has lived
too long : A second war opens to hii
view, and catches him like the past in
enterppfing commercial adventures I
wish his situation now was correfporident
to his situation thenâbut alas! injured
by the capture of his vefTels, and injured
by the paper payments received from
his country, he was reduced low *
âWhen he recommenced on the return
of peace the business to which he bad
been bred, again his honesty flourifhed,
and he had again fair profpeas from the
flow but certain gains of frugality and in
dustry.âHi& numerous family urged him
into an extension of his foreign business,
and pending his second adventure on hig
enlarged plan, war appears !âwar unne
cessary and apparently courted !âbut so
it isâfor could you hear the debates of
the Congress, you would think that our
| country's happiness is at an end Re
venge governs our politiciansâ or perhaps
ir m its garb, personal interests, personal a
nimosity, and base ambitionâOur Le
gislators are too highly paidâThey be
come proud and mighty of spirit, and
think that as they are well off so long as
they can hold their places, which they
.count certain so long as the passions and
not the judgment of their constituents can
be rcforted to, and therefore hold cheap
the pnblic welfare,âVirginia ought to
set the good example of mixing honor
with coin, in return for the services of
Congress. lam told your own State Se
nators and State delegates have but twelve
shillings per day in money, and the ba
lance in honor; and they are generally
speaking, superior to the United States'*
â Ho'ufe of Representatives.
An experiment in Congress in this
way would be fair in this period of theory
âif it produced refpedt to refra&ion andcontempt for declamation, the bkffings of
ear political courtitutipns would probably
-Continue from generation to generation.
Unlets foirie change takes place soon, mea

sometimes, and mal-adminillratiori of the
Federal Gevernment always, together with
the weight of obligation to France occali
oualiy,compofe the text, and yon would be
aftoniihed at the capacity of the expositors,
for although eloquence is rare among them,
found argument confined to one (your ami
able, theoretic country-man,) they all pil
fers parliamentary courage, and they all
use their right of franking letters liberal
ly, and of coiirfe make much buttle in the
Honfe and out of the Houle.âThey will
I in/about a war, if Great-Britain is not
itaiiviveablv averse to itâunless the good
sense of the landed interest of the United
States interferes in time.âTo be moder
ate begins to be criminalâand to address
the judgment of those entrusted with the
awful right of changing us from peace to
war, is conlidered as treason.âUrge on
war ! is the tone amonj; men who are am
p}y paid and greatly trusted by a people
not frefc from the debt of a war founded
on morality, the nativity of independence,
and giving to their extensive country the
full bleflings of true liberty, with the mod
flattering profpecls that their dear children
\fhould enjoy the boon pofleffed, without
\he tax of the calamity to whiih their .fa
thers were exposed in procuring it.âl ue
disgraceful appellnt'on of Monarchist and
Aristocrat, is affixed to those who depre
cate war, by the impudent and unprinci
pled abetters of anarchy, who debase the
liberty they enjoy, by denying to their
fellow-citizens one of its mod precious at
tributes, the freedom of opinion.âTell
ine whether the late proceedings of your
towns, bespeak. truly the sense of the
towns ?âAnd, whether if this be the

towns râWhen I lived in Virginia, the

For the Gaz
Mr. Fenno,
OUR di (organizing party fay, leave the
work of govtrnm'en to our management.
We will let matters into a wonderfully fine
trainâWe will continue embargo afer em
bargo, for the benefit of trade. The Engliih
will not let us traffic in the Weft Indies, and
we will cut off at a stroke of our guillotine
all trade with EnglandâWe will break ail
the bones that we find whole in the Ikins of
Our poOr briiifed' merchants. We will pre
vent negotiation in order to prevent warâ
We will fequeiler debts, prohibit all com
merce and'do our worst to scare the Engliih
men out of their wits, left we ihould be dis
pleased with them. In the mean time we
will go cm and reftri# trade very much at
leisure, we (hall have nothing else to do.
Thus for the love we bear our dear mer
chants, we will have no commerce. Our
zeal for peace is (hewn just as sensibly. We
lay (tumbling blocks in the way of negoci
ation. We scorn to treat when we have
taufe of war with England. When we have
a<3ual war with Algiers we scorn to do any
' thing but treat, In the firft cafe, treating is
plaving the fool, in the second, arming is
not better. To get ready for war, we talk
fiercely. We stab the revenue to the vitak,
forbid the importations which yield it, and
th*n llrong in poverty we defy all foes.
Without the (inews of war, we will provoke
It. Let us alone, and the national govern

MANHEIM, January to. .
Field-Marshal Count Moellendorf, who re
places the Duke of Brunfwick in the com
mand of the Prussian Army, is expected in
a few days.
The French have set fire to the Palace of
Worms.
The French column that evacuated Krentz
nach on the 9th infiant, retreated beyond
Birkenfeldt, every where railing contribu
tions, and carrying ofFHoftages. It is thought
that that column will soon retreat beyond
the river Queich.
The Inhabitants are evefy where riling
on the Banks of the Rhine, and it is thought
thatfeveral Circles of the Empire will ihortly
furnifli an army of 100,000 men.
January 21.
Yefterdaythe Prufiiansattacked the French
befvWen Worms and Rhine-Durkhelm. The
cannonade lasted several. hours, but the issue
of the engagement has not transpired.
111 the afternoon t>f the 19th intelligence
was received at Oppenheim, that the French
were on the point of evacuating Worms, and
from the large volumes of fmofce which rose
from that quarter, there is reason to suppose
that that city has been set bn fire. We ex
peift the farther particulars,.
The Duke of Briinfwick is at Merttz,and
General Knobelfdorf has reached O]
heim.
The Republicans have upwards of iooo
waggons with them, which came from Lor
rain and Alsace, for the purpose of carrying
oft" the immense booty which they take in
this country.
The French were driven from the Village
of Marlheim on the 13th inft. with great
loss, the best part of their cavalry and in
fantry was killed. The reft made a preci
pitate retreat to Kirchheim, favored by a
thick fog. One of their advanced polls of
1100 men, Rationed in the wood, was en
tirely cut in pieces. The Prussians also took
on this occasion three officers, 48 privates
and upwards of 20 borfes.
We are this moment informed, that the
smoke seen in the environs of Worms, was
owing to the conflagration of the Palace, and
of all the buildings belonging to the Nobi
lity and Gentry.
CONSTANTINOPLE, Dec. 12.
Giafar Han, Sovereign of the. Chtrasf
one of the molt powerful Princes of Per
sia, has lately been dethroned by his 'bro
ther, Mahomft Han, who entefed into
the possession of his dominionsâThis new
Periian usurper is now threatening the
Turkish dominions with a powerful rtva
fion. i
A far more formidable enemy has late
ly riien in Arabia, who menaces the Sub
lime Porte with no less than a total fub
verlion of the Mahometan Religion and
ddtrudtion to the reign of the Succefiors
of the Caliphs.
This enemy'is a Schcich Hujabi, who
is at the head of a numerous Arabian
Tribe, encamped between Mecca and Baf
fora. He profcfles to deny the Divine
Million of Mahomet, the Sandtity of the
Alcoran, and all the Religious Ceremo
nies of Mahometanifm. He and his Tiibe
are continually adoring the Divinity in
the open field, defpiiing the institution of
Mosques or Temples. The Father of
this Arabian Chief, an old man of eigh
ty, is the Founder, and Principal Priest
of this new feit. The Rights and Laws,
he has > composed himfelf, and collated
in a book. It is much apprehended, that
he fuft acts of hostility of these New
SeÂ£taries will be directed againlt Mecca
aod Medina, in order to render themfelvcs
masters of the immense treasures of the
Ottoman Empire contained in these two
towns.
Our Government seem in a sea of un
certainty, respecting the powerful Iman,
of Mafcaty of whom it is yet unknown,
which party he will embrace.

NATfONAL CONVENTION,
January 12.
A letter from Tureau Bourbottc, re
presentatives at the Isle of Noirmoutier,
which they have called the Isle of the
Mountain, stated that they had taken all
the necessary precautions to guard this is
land, which might be called one of the
keys of France. They had established a
fuificient garrison, appointed an able en
gineer, a Sans Culotte cÂ«mmander,' and
a revolutionary tribunal of a good ilamp.
âOn the morning alter victory, the com
miffi mers, thinking that a number of roy
alills mi-;ht be concealed in the woods,
and among the rocks, ordered a general
hunt of them in the fame manner as of ra
bits : and this search brought forth an im
mense crowd of priests, of the wives of
emigrants, and others who hadconftantly
eluded the pursuit of the Republicans.
A military commission was lffued to try
tljefe people, and from General Delbec
downwards they had fuffered death.
â¢'You will.fee," fays the letter, "by
the copy of the interrogatory of Delbec,
that the isle of Noirmontier became the
retreat of these chiefs, only because they
were led v to eXpect these succors from Pitt,
to whom they, only fifteen days before,
had sent the Chevalier du
present to the English court a Have of the
forces, the resources and the wants of the
royaliitsin this part of France, agreeable
to the desire of the British cabinet, and
they found provisions for 20,000 men for
fix months.
Thursday, January 23.
The representative of the people, Le

ex-deputy, Dechezeaux, hasjuft paid the
forfeit of his crimes with his head. The
-republican ship, the Jemappe, of 74 guns,
has been launched, and will soon be fol

spirit of revolution is at its acme in these
parts.
The criminal code is not fufficiently se
vere ; or rather, it takes no notice of per
jury in criminal causes. This day the
National Convention decreed, " That a
falfe witness (hall incur the fame punilh
ment which would have been incurred by
the person against whom his falihood was
directed."
On the' proposition of Thuriot, the
question, whether perjury in civil caules
ought not to be punished with death ? is
referred to the committee of legislation.

The Texture of the Paper is thicker and
whiter and it takes the ink more freely than
the genuine paper.
The O. in' the word Company is smaller
than the M. and other letters of that word,
so that a line extended from the top of the O,
to touch the top of the M. would extend con
siderably above the range of the whole word.
In the word United the letters are narrow
erand closer together than the reft of the bill
The i and fin the word promise are not
parallel, the yinclining much more torwarj
than the i.
The engraving is badly cxecuted.the ftrolces
of all the Letters are stronger and the device
in the margin particularly is much coarser and
appears darker than in the true bills. Some

They are printed on a paper nearly similar
to that of the-counterfeit Five Dollar Notes

The fine ruled lines through the word Twen

APRIL 23. ,
By this Day's Mail.
NEW-YORK, April 22.
Capt. Kemp of the Ohio, arrived yrjierday
frotn London, has faifored us with Lon
don prints to the I $th February, from
which we have copied the following ;â â
N. Y. Daily Adv.
LONDON, February 7.
morning the arrival of the
Swallow Packet at Torbay, with the Most
Noble Max-quis Cornu-allis, and part of his
fuiti on board,was announced at the India-
House.
The Swallow left Madras on the ioth of
oflober.
When the Swallow left India, all the Pre
sidencies and poireffior.s bf the Company
â were in an unexampled state of prosperity ;
five lacks of Pagodas had been fen't to Ben
gal from Madras, and there were still five
lacks remaining in the Treasury of Fort St.
George.
Tippoo Saib had made all liis payments ;
aad what is still better given the mod ample
and decided opinion against the conduit of
the French, pledging himfelf to have no
concern or alliance with, the Convention.
The Nabob of Arcot and Rajah of Tan
jote bad also used the molt ardent and spirit
ed exertions in supplying our i orces with
provi(ion9,&c. on their march to
Lord Ilood having seen it arfeited in the
French Gazette, that a great ntynber of vef
fe!s had entered the Pott of Toulon, being
ignorant of its recapttTre, has unequivocally
contradicted this afiertion in his lait diipatch
es ; and'baa, moreover, written word âthat
since Toulon was evacuated, only one Ihip of
any (lefcript!':n has entered that Port. From
this we mav judge what degree of credit is
due to the i eports of the French Convention.
According to the last dii'patches from In
dia, we are haipy to announce the fafe arri
val of Lord Macartney at Pekin. His Lord
fliip writes from thence, that he has been re
ceived by the Emperor of China with the
utmost civility ; and there is every profpeil
of the object of his embassy being obtained.
The Omnium was yesterday done at the
Stock Exchange, at the very low price of 1
half per cent, premium.
Two very conti adiclory reports concern*
ing Robespierre, have been in circulation for
these last few days. One states, that the
rifcn in favor cf Chabot r.nd Bazire,
nave afiemiiled round the houses of Robef
pierte and Danton with very alarming de
monstrations of difconte.it, and were Hill be
sieging thoi'e two famous Anarchists, when
the Courier who brought this intelligence
came away. The other on the contrary,
fays, that a plan is in agitation of declaring
Robefpiirre the Dictator of France.
We are not able to state the origin and
foundation of the firft of these rumours ;
but the lafter probably originates from the
following event:
Mr. de Bompere, Commander of a di
â¢vifion of the French Northern Army, re
ceived lately an expreis from Paris, which
informed him, that there existed at Paris
a very strong party in favor of Louis
XVII. Whose designs it were impoflible
to fruftrate by any other means, but that
of railing Robespierre to the dignity of
a Didlator ; and that he (Bompere) ought
to found the sentiment of the Army on
this fubjeft.
As Bompere seeming to express some
afloniftiment at this piece of information,
the emissary told him, that he must imme
diately acquaint him with what he meant
to do, and that his life was at stake
Upon which Bompere promised to com
ply with the request, but seized the firft
opportunity of effe&ing his escape into
Austrian Flanders. Count Kinflcy, an
Austrian General, to whom in judica
tion of his desertion, Bompere related
this tranfa&ion, caused his relation to be
printed, and a great number of them to
be distributed among the advanced posts
of the French Army.
A few copies have reached London,
Â»nd the above is the substance of the
contents.
Letters were received yesterday morn
ing from Flanders, which give art account
of preparations making at Dunkirk, now
called Dunes Fibres. They have already
21 gun-boats, and are arming fix others.
They are also preparing furnaces for heat
ing balls.
Letters from Turin, dated Jan. 11,
states, that the French, owing to the bad
weathei, were obliged precipitately to a -
bandon their posts, with the loss of bag
' g a g c . artillery, ammunition and men.
The report of Jourdain's disgrace and
arrest, which originated at Brufels is no
longer believed there.
Ascording to the accounts from the
Weft Indies, a great number of Ameri
can ships had been taken and feht into our
ports under the ordet of Nov. 6th. This
order* issued by our Minillers on no prin
ciple of justice or found policy, but in
the intoxication of imaginary success, and
as puiillanimoufly retracted as it wa9 incon
liderately issued, will thus be adted upon
for fevcral weeks, and the public will have
to pay all the expences incurred by the de
tention of the ships taken only to be res
tored. The effects of it in America will
be to convince every man that the Stated
ace not to depend for the security of their
commerce as a neutral nation, on the mo
deration of the Britifli Cabinet, but on
their own power to afford it prote&ion.
The Swiss Cantons have returned an
Answer to the Memorial presented by
Lord Fitzgerald, the Britifli Minister
This Answer, which has been given ever
fmce the 30th of November last, implies,
that it is the un alterable resolution of the
Cantons, regardless of the lcenes of hor
ror which France, paralized by anarchy,
.exhibits,to adhere to a molt inviolable fyfÂ»
tem of Neutrality, it being a precept and
maxim transmitted to the Swil's by their
ancestors, never to meddle in Foreign
broils.
The extraordinary expences have arisen
in France to such a height, that in the
montli of November only, they amounted
to 227 millions of livres, which is more
than half of the yearly expence before the
Revolution.
We cannot expect any material news
from Flanders for some time. We have
feeji gentlemen who have returned from
Flanidert so late a> Friday evening. The
rÂ«ads are impaffible'for the tratifportation
of cannon, which alone would prevent any
offenfive operatiory, were either party dis
posed to begin them..
A letter from Vienna* dated January
20, contains the following news r
" The objedl of the negociation of the
marquis Luchrefini has at last transpired.
The court of Berlin refufed to take any
part in another campaign, unless subsidies'
were paid to his Prussian majesty by the
EJmperor and the German Empire. These
have been granted. The yearly sum to be
paid by the Emperor and the Empire a
mountsto ten millions of florins; and his
Prussian majesty has bound himfclf, besides
his contingent to fnmifh an army of 40,000
men at the opening of the enl'uing cam
paign. v ; .
" His Imperial majesty has at length
given his consent to a War-Tax being im
posed on his fubje&s; but in order to
ease their burthens, he has at the fame i
time lefolved to fend a set of gold plate to
the mint, which was made under the reign
of Francis I. and colt above a million of
florins. x With the fame view he has also
leflened the expences of his court.
PARIS, February I.
All the Journals .own, the troops
of the Republic, evacuated Worms agree
able to the plan of their Generals, and not
owini to the valor of the Prussians.
A Letter from Cambray of the 30th
ult. states that a great number of Austrian
Huffarsjoin the Standard of the Republic,
and that desertion seems to be quite a con
tagion among them.
They write from the Port of the Moun
tain(Toulon), that eight fail of line are
nearly iCady for sea ; that our losses are
not so great as Were represented ; that the
Neapolitans left behind them 12 brass
cannon, and several suits of regimentals ;
and the Spaniards 4,000 bombs, besides
mufquets, &c. The English fleet conti
nues cruizng off the harbour.
By a letter from Rotterdam, dated Janu
ary 3'Â» J 794-
We are informed that the English,
had captured and carried into Jerfev,
Two American vessels; Captain Maley,
from Philadelphia, and Captain Bar-"

From Mr. Pitt, theÃritifli Ministers speech
at opening the Budget or estimates of sup
plies of men and money for the service of
the current year âit appears, that out of
85,000 â¢Teamen voted for the second year of
the war, 75,000 of that number have been .
raised and muttered. The augmentation of
the land forces amounts to 30,000 menâ
30,000 more are to be raisedâthe total vpte
makes the troops of that country, including
fencibles and militia to amount to 140,000
menâthe ,'oreign troops in the Britilh ser
vice amount to between 30 and 4dthoufand.
The whole force by land and lea, to be em

The produce of the taxes for the year,

produce of the year 1792, which was a year
of extraordinary prdfperity, and after a con
tinuance of peace for nine years. But, for
his calculation for the present year, Mr./Pitt
takes as upon a form'er occasion, an average
of four years, by which it appears that the

ideas from tlie perusal, that have hi-'
thdrto been a stranger to his mind.
" In a republic where men are alter
nately citizens and fovcrrigns, there is no
thing more easy than to lead them into
disorder, and nothing so uncommon as to
fee them, for any length of time, confine
themselves to the cxercife of their conjli
tutionalrights. Upon the leasE encourage*
ment they are ready to overleap these pre
scribed bounds, and call themselves into
clubs, fhat they may exercise a kind of
fovt'reignty over the sovereignty of their
country. When a people fuffer themselves
to drink out of this intoxicating cup,- the
duty of obedience soon becomes a grievous
burden, and the best of governments an
intolerable evil: 1 con fitter the institution
of political clubs, therefore, by whatever
name they may be called, as the firft stage
of a revolution, and the revolution as com
pleted in fad, though it may hot in form,
whenever the resolves of clubs ihall control
the resolutions of government* or their ft
cret combinations dirsft the choice of repre
fentatiiies. From that moment the repub
lic has changed its nature andceafed to be
freeâ¢ But if clubs are the harbingers of
anarchy in a good government, they are
no less the forerunners of reform in a bad
one: In both- cafcs they ast by dejlroying,
and are as much to be dreadrti in the one
as encouraged in the other.

" Congress has laid an embargo on all

THE grand principle of Equality,*!' right

Umverfal justice, sacred order, and perfect
freedom, can be firmly built, and permanent
ly secured. The vewof it exhibited in this
elTay, at the Tame tune that it rejrrelfes the
inl'olence of office, the tyranny of pride, and
the outrages of oppieffion j confirm#, i n the
most iorcible manner, the necessity of subor

bands of Jbciety, that it maintains'iiiviolate,
every natural and every civil dittinctiou,
draws more cloCely every (ocial tie, unites in
one harmonious and justly proportioned sys
