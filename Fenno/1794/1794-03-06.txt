January 30.
In committee of the whole on Mr. Madison's
refulutions.
Speech of Mr. Madison.
[continued.]
If it were neoeflary to investigate the
full amount of re-exportations, several ar
ticles might have been added to the lift,
such as Whale-Oil, Ginseng, Flax-Seed,
&c.
Nor would it be unfair, perhaps, to in
clude the primitive value of the articles,
re-exported in the new forms given to
them by art. A great proportion of what
is sent from the United States to Great-
Britain, in a rude state, it worked into
articles of merchandize, and exported in
the course of trade. Take, for example,
the two articles of Pot and Pearl A (lies,
and Indigo.
The amount of the Â«xport of the form
er to Great-Britain, is Hated at 747,078
dollars ; of which, if no part is re-export
ed in its unaltered state, the whole enters
into British manufa&ures. Supposing one
third of these particular manufa&ures, to
be exported which appears to be nearly
the general proportion, the value of Pot
and Pearl Afties re-exported, is 249,026
dollars.
The indigo used in Great Britain has
appeared to be 379,064 dollars. One
third of which re-exported as an ingredi
ent in manufactures, is 126,254 1-2 dol
lars. These two items alone amount to
375'3 50 2 "3 dollars,and with many others
might be added to the mass of re-expor
tations. But they are stated rather to
throw light on the general chara&er of
our trade with Great Britain, than to be
relied on in the present cafe, which has
been fufficiently elucidated by more direst
and simple views of it.
Mr. M. proceeded to apply the cal
culations he had made, to the question
discussed by Mr. Smith, in relation to the
comparative importance of the French and
Britifti matkets to the productions of the
United States.
By deducting the 3,501,067 dollars, re
exported, from the 6,651,429 dollars, im
ported into Great Britain, he reduced her
actual consumption to 3,150,362 dollars,
to which adding the 1,805,744 exported
to the Weft-India market, the whole Bri
tish consumption Hands at no more than
4>9j6,106 dollars. On comparing this
with the exports to the French dominions
(who re-export none of any consequence)
to wit, 4,424,336, the fubjift took a ve
ry different aspect from that which h?d
been given to it.
But there was, Mr. M. observed, a cir
cumstance of the utmost importance to a
fair view of this question, which had been
wholly overlooked by the gentleman from
Scuth-Carolina, and which cut up his cal
culations by the roots.
The re-exportations from G. Britain,
were not only to be fubt rafted from the
consumption of G. Britain, but in a great
degree being made to France, were to he
added to the value of her market to the a -
griculture and commerce of the United
States
The re-exportations from G. Britain to
France, could not be accurately fixed bv
- any documents to be had here. In gene
ra!, they were known to be great. Jie
would, he said, confine himfelf ro the
two articles of Tobacco and Flour, of
which he estimated the amounts as fol
lows :
The tobacco exported from the United
States, appears to be about loc.ooo
hhds. It is valued in the return of our
exports at 4,349,567 dollars.
It is known that France consumes about
1-4 of the whole quantity exported, that
is, 1,087.392 dollars. It appears, by the
return of our exports, that the dired ex
ports of this article to France, -(lands at
3 8+.641 dollars. The indirect fuppliosKm Lc Fiance, not appealing in the re
turn* of oar exports, and tu be added to
them, is 702,750dollars.
Of the Flour sad Grain feat to Great-
Britain, ailovriug, as above stated, 1-4 to
have been there coaltuaed, which is pro
bably beyond the tcuLh, the re-exporta
tion amounted tu 81 Â£,880 dollars. It is
well uuLi.tuod, that France v is the mar
ket where these articles were finally con
fwned. The acconnt may now be liated.
To the French Market direct-
ly exported for confump- DoH<ir.t.

Total of French consumption, 5,942,92 1
Total of Britilh do. 4,956,106
Excetsof Fieach coufumption 986,115
Thus it appears, without taking into
the account the other articles re-exported
to France, thit the market of that coun
try for our exports, was worth to the U
nited States nearly a million more than
the market of Great Britain, and yet the
gentleman from South Carolina had re
presented the Britifli market as exceeding
the French in the annual amount of be
tween three and four millions ; and hod
pronounced, without hesitation that G.
Britain in reference to our productions,
was a more important cujlomer than France
almoil in the ratio of tivo to one.
Mr. M. returning to the Secretary's
report said, he hoped after what had
been (he\vn, it would be needless to trou
ble the committee, with further remarks
on thi InbjeCt. In dismissing it however,
he could not do justice to his own im
prelTijns, without declaring his entire con
fidence, that the report would be regard
ed by ail difceroing and unprejudiced jud
ges, as one of the many monuments
which its author had left behind him, of
the zeal, the talents, and the patriot ism
with which he had dilcharged the duties
of his ftstion j and that he bad carried
with him into retirement, a purity, both
in his public and private name, which no
.thing that could be (aid within or without
the walls of Cougrefs, could tarnilh.
Having gone thro' the particular ob
servations into which he had been led by
the attack made on the report of the Se
cretary of State before the committee, he
(hould procceed to a more general view of
what had been urged by the opponents of
the resolutions he had introduced.
Among other things it had been alledg
ed in the latter stage of the debate, that
the friends of the resolutions had involved
themselves in inconsistency, by Ihifting the
ground of argument from commercial to
political ronfiderations. In answer to this
charge, he remarked, that if in any in
stance of his public life he was free from
the charge of inconsistency, it was on the
fubjeSt of vindicating our national inter
ests, against the policy of Great Britain
towards us : that in all the public stations
with which he had been honored since the
peace, and on every occasion which had
occurred, his conduct had been marked
by an adherence to this principle : that if
in the firft arguments he
had dwelt chiefly on commercial topics,
it would be recollected that he kept tjiti
door open for political ones, if the turn of
the difcuflions require them : that
he had forborne to enlarge on the political
fides of the question, because he thought
it defenfible on commercial grounds, and
was willing to meet it on those grounds,
because he did not with to mingle unne
ceflarily, irritating ideas in the difcuflion,
and because he had supposed that every
thing relating to the tieaty of peace, the
Indians, the Algerines, the spoliations
&c. were fufficiently imprinted on every
mind, and would have all the rffefts they
ought to have, without being particular
ly enforced.
Whilst he could thus repel the charge
of inconsistency brought against himfelf;
it mull be evident he thought, how much
room there was for retorting the charge.
In the early stages of the difcuflion,there
seemed but one sentiment as to the cori
duft of Great Britain, at least in a politi
cal view; the difference turned on the
question, whether we could or ought to
counteract her condud. In the latter
stages of the difcuflion, palliations if not
j unifications had been multiplied and la
bored ; not only with refpeft to her com
mercial poKcy, but with refpefl to. the
detention of the polls, the Indians, the
Algerines, and even the spoliations <jf our
ventral commerce ; on the u*lawfulnefÂ»
of which -our executive lad grounded the
remonii ranee and demand of iwdetnuilica
tion lyiug on the table.
in addition to tins, he stated the in
consistency between tnofe who maintained
andthoie who reje&eil the theory of leav
ing commerce yerfeÂ£Uy free; the iucon-
Cftency of rejecting this theory, and yet
refilling to meet rellri&ions on one fide,
with re&ri&ionson the other : the rocon
filtency of condemning a cummercikl dis
crimination between nations, as contrary
to the wife example of <G. Britain, and
claiming for G. Britain the credit ofmak
iug such discriminations in favor of the
United States: The inconfittcncy of pre
dicting that the measure would dellroy the
revenue, and infilling that the dutied arti
cles would continue to be imported from
the lame source thro' more expenfivechan
nels : The inconliftency of exclaiming a
gainst topics and remarks which may a
waken the paflions, and endeavonring
themselves to alarm our fears; of exhort
ing the committee to consult its judgment
alone, and substituting for argument con
tinued addreflesto the imagination.
7Â°2,70y
Partigular pains, he remarked,had been
taken tu exhibit a picture of our nation
al prosperity, which might flatter our
withes, and forbid experiments. It was
readily admitted, he said, that there were
many features in the face of our affairs,
which were proper themes of mutual con
gratulation, whether compared with the
fttuation of other countries, or with our
own, under other circumstances. And
it gave him much pieafure to add, that
the degree of prosperity we enjoyed, tho'
not to be exclusively credited to the
change of our federal government, or to
particular measures under it, according to
the exaggerations of some, wss yet so
far, and so evidently the fruit of that
change, as to do honor to the people of
Amenca in adopting it. He mentioned
two innovations making part of the con
stitution, which must alone, have had a
powerful effefi in meliorating the condi
tion of this country, to wit: The prohi
bition of paper money or other violations
of contraÂ£ts, and the abolition of inco
herent and rival regulations of trade,amang
the several states. But notwithstanding
the flourilhing state of our affairs, when
viewed under certain aspeCts, if was equal
ly certain that there were others, which
suggested very different reflections.

House of Reprefentaiivet.
Monday, March 3.
Mr.Sedgwick of the committee to whom
was referred the resolution of the House,
authorizing the President of the United
States to negociate (if neceflary) a loan
of one million of dollars, brought in a
bill pursuant to that resolution.
Mr. Tracy of the committee on the
Poft-Office law, brought in a bill pursu
ant to the report of the committee of the
whole, which had been agreed to by the
HouseâThis bill was twice read and re
ferred to the committee of the whole house
on Friday nextâlnterim to be printed
for the use of the members.
A msfTage was received from the Pre

ferred to a committee.
Several other petitions were read and
referred.
A report was read from the Secretary
of the Treasury, on sundry petitions which
had been referred to himâThe letter en
closing this report suggests to the House,
whether it would not be expedient to
place the business of reporting on petitions
in some other channel, as the prefTure of
his official duties in addition to the extra
business in consequence of the enquiry in
to the Treasury Department, will not per
mit him to pay that seasonable and prompt
attention to these petitions which the par
ties expect and have a just claim to.
It being moved to read the confidential
communications just received from the
Presidentâthe galleries were clearedâat
2 o'clock the doors were again openedâ
when,
Mr. Madison's resolutions were called

The report of the committee relative
to lands formerly in the (late of North-

time spent in difcufiion, progrefa was re
potted. The Until/' adjourned.
Tuesday, March 4.
A melTage was received from the Se
nate, informing the House, that the

" The judicial power of the United
States (hall not be condrued to extend to
any suit in law or equity, commenced or
prosecuted againd one of the United States
by citizens of another State, or by citizens
or fubjefts of any foreign state."
To this amendment Mr. Boudinot pro
posed an amendment, the objeit of which
was to qualify the principle by condition
ing that the dates should make provision
for the attainment of Judice in the State
CourtsâThisamendment was negativedâ
only seven ayes appearing on calling the
yeas and nays.
The quedion then was on the third

to the committee of the whole, that the
report was substantially a recommendatory
businessâthe carrying of which, into ex

Philosophy. Literally, the love of
wisdomâdivided into Natural and Mo
ral. Moral Philosophy teacheth the re
lations and duties of moral agents. Men,
are all born equal:âand their end is equal:
alike weak and helpless at their birth ;
and, when they fall into the graveâthe
chamber of Eternal Sleepâthey are alike,
motionless, and tending to dissolution.â
The house prepared for all the Lvi.ig, re
ceives the king and the beggar; where
they both rot like an or a
horfe-tâJ. The ideaof an etherialfpark,
or spiritual part, which was formerly sup
posed by enthusiasts immortally to partake
of happiness or pain in a future existence,
has been totally reprobated by the fort ef
frits; moral goodness or turpitude, as it
may affett a man's condition after death,
is, therefore, a mere chimera; invented
by designing priests, and ought forever to
be banished from genuine depurated theo
logy. Tbefe bugbears have never had
any tendency but to make slaves and cow
ards :â-Slaves, to sacerdotal and regal
craft; âever too pusillanimous, to attempt
bold atchievments ; fueh as murders, af
faflinations, and robberies :âbut, thanks
to the Qlumiuations of modern genius,
and French Philosophy ! This delulion,
and all these checks have vanilhed, like a
mist before the rays of Sol.
From the equality, which nature has
rftablilhed inthe mannerof comingintothe
world, as ijvell as of going out of it, the
strongest reason is inferred, that (he in
tended all men (hould be equal while in
it. All those differences, by which one
man is rich, and another is poor; one
man hath houses and lands, and another
hath none ; one man hath breeches, and
another is obliged to go without, are of
course owing to the tyranny of accident,
custom. or some of the occult qualities of
Aristotle. Nothing can be clearer than
th )t all those differences are repugnant to
natural equalityâand, as liberty of choice
and aiftion, is as much a part of the droits
d'Homme, as equality, there is a strong
propeniity in nature to re'tore the origi
nal equilibrium :âAnd, woe to those,
who (hall oppose the glorious revolution !
The Sans Culottes, or disciples of the
Parilian School, have now spread them
selves all over France ; properly equipped
with great guns and small; with poign
ards, and fcymetars, and guillotines of all
dimensions, to propagate the doctrines of
Liberty and Equality. They teach every
where, and enforce it too, by a&ions, that,
the belief in an All-Mighty, and AU-Jult
Creator and Ruler, is a ridiculous fable ;
that, if a Sans Culotte, hath an appe
tite for a new wife, or two or three of
them, he may .take where he ehoofes ; and
if any obftru&ioji to the gratification,
(hould be offered by husbands or parents,
instantly to cmfh it, by making use of the
weapons he carries with him :âAnd, as
they have this unqueilionable right to the
â¢wives, and daughters of all who rtfufe
to become instant proselytes, they certain
ly have a m;:ch llronger title to every
thing else.
There are two fefls of heretics, who
ire equally enemies to the New Phi'ofo
>hy :âThe one is called Royaljl or Ar'if
ocrat, the other FtiLrulijt : The former
s the molt dangerous. Hitherto, howe
per, their oppjfuion hath been ineffectu
al. Of those, w.io have not fallen in
combat with the brave Sans Culottes, some
have been captivated, brought to a fum
jnary trial, and immediately guillotined ;
and after they have been thus effectually
put to silence, their processes have been
drawn up, and pubhfhed ; bv which their
attiocious opposition to the bleifed doc
trine of Liberty and Equality, has been
clearly evinced. Others of them have
been pursued to their strong holds, and
fortified towns; where they have mostly
perished by fire or sword. It is now pro
posed to deltroy eveTy place, that affords
them shelter, even to the last town in the
Republic : And in order to accelerate the
extermination of these vermin, it hath
been resolved to destroy them in groups
of four or five hundred, in a moment, by
springing of mine* under them. How
much i* the world indebted to the New
Fbilolbphy, for this grand discovery !
Where force at any particular time or
place, is inefficient to accompli(h the pur
pole intended, this system allows the use
of all the arts of diffiraolation, Lying
aad Petjury, that ftie mod fruitful inven
tion can devise :âFor as the end fan&i
â¢fits the means, all means are alike, that
are ufefttl in cftabliihing the grand designs
of universal Liberty and Equality.
The ancient Romans, the moll glorious
Republic the world ever knew* whefe
chara&er in some refpeÂ£ts the Sans Cu
lottes are the fitteft of all men on earth to
aflame, adopted these principles. In this
manner they procured their wives among
the Sabines; and their lands too, from
them and the other neighbouring nations.
We burn with impatience to imitate, and
if possible to excel them. They ere&ed
temples to ideal divinities, to gratify the
common people ; who, when not enga
ged in arms, mull be amused by some
farce or other. With similar views the
Sans Philosophers, are about to
raise an edifice in honor of Rtafon and
Truthâthe greatest farce imaginable !â
for they are too wife to suppose there is
the least eflential difference between reason
and truth, and the ranked madness and
falfehood; only that the former are names,
which they have nit en invoked, as a charm
against their enemies.
But there is one article in which we
have improved on the ancient Sans Cul
lottes of Rome. Among them, the vo
taries of the goddess of love and beauty
used torefort to her temples, to perform
their dated devoirs in secretâamong those
of Paris the fair idols (hall be fcle&ed
from the feflion of files de joie ; and be
ing drefied in the most splendid Cyprian
attire be introduced into the great Hall
of the Sans Culottes ; where in the pre
sence of all the multitude, the President
fliall embrace them with a kiijs of frater
nity.

By a ftiip arrived at Bollon from IÂ»if
bon, intelligence is received, that Toulon
was befiegedbyan army of 130,000 men;
that these troops commanded the entrance
of the upper and lower harbor, so that it
was impossible to go out or come inâ
That the ga'rrifon mini fall in timeâbut
t,hat the allies had poffeTion of two emi
nences, under the guns, of which they
moored their (hipping, having previously
taken out their provisions and artillery-â
and placed them in their forts on the moun
tains they holdâthat the allies are resolv
ed to burn their (hips, if they (hould be
obliged to surrenderâThese fortreffes can
hold out against every thing, for a long
time, except famineâbut that there was
no profpeft of relief. The foregoing ac
count the Captain of the {hip fays, he
had from two Bntifh officers who wer - on
furlough at Lifoonâthefe officers left T >u

The proceedings of the Town Meeting in
80/ ion, have been publi/hed. The fol
lowing remonflrance addrejfcd to the Mo
derator, and Jtgncd by four hundred of
the Merchants and principal citizens, will
shew the true sense of that Town.
The Petition and Remonstrance of
the Subscribers, Merchants, Traders
and others, inhabitants of the tÂ»wn of
Boston, refpe&fully shews;
THAT having had information that it
it is in .contemplation of the town, pub
licly to express its fentimente, that it is
expedient to impose certain reftri&ions on
the navigation and commerce of foreign
nations, in order to remove and counteract
the embarrafiinents which now exist, or
which are to be apprehended from their
conduct with respect to the commerce and
navigation of this country.
We conccive it our duty to express to
our fellow-citizens our apprehensions, that
the existing evils, or those which are to be
feared, do not at a period so critical and
eventful as the present, require the violent
and hazardous remedy which is proposed
to be applied to them. ,
We are convinced that the proposed
reftriftions, instead of relieving, will ac'd
embarrassments, if not finally destroy our
ccmmerce, and may possibly hazard the
tranquility of the country.
The attention of our representatives in
Congress, already evinced on this fubjeA,
jultifies us in the molt unlimited confidence
in their ability, and inclination to secure
to lis every commercial advantage confid
ent with the present situation of our
country, and the best interests of its inha-
bitants.
On the'r wisdom and patriotism we
rely, for the adoption of such measures as
will indemnify us for injuries received, and
place our commerce on that independent
and refpe&able basis, due to a sovereign
and neutral nation. But should the town
decide in favor of adopting a measure of
such extent and importance, as to have
already occupied the attention of Congress
for many weeksâwe (hall conceive it our
duty to rcmonftrate against the proceed
ing, with such arguments, as appear to us
fuffieient to (hew the ill policy and inex
pediency of it. We therefore pray that
the town will for the present suspend the
further consideration of the fubjeft.

THEATRICALS.
OBSERVER, No. VII.
Last evening the Caremelite, and
Spoiled Child, were performed at the
New Theatre. Mrs. Whitlocl, inthecha
rafter of Matilda, gave more specimens of
gieat theatric powers than even is usual
for her
The Tragedy of the Carmelite is one
of the best ; and it is with much plealure
that the Observer pronounces, the enter
tainment, lad evening, was of the best
kind ; he believes the plays, and perform
ance, taken together, have more merit,
thau any which have been exhibited by
this Company. And with due deference
to the opinion of the managers, he hopes
they will at no great distance of time again
introduce the fame plays.âHe is encou
raged to a fit this indulgence for one reason,
which cannot be disagreeable to the play
ers, which is, that the next performance
may, and probably will be in less need of
a prompter ; it cannot be a new idea to
the actors, that the audience, are distressed,
by a too frequent recurrence to the aid, of
that ufeful man, the Prompter.
The Observer hints to Mrs. Whitlocl;
the wold 1 thy' (he sometimes pronounees
< the'âwould not a uniformity, of â¢ thy,'
be bettter ? For instance, ' support me in
' the armt' and â¢ turu thy dear eyes upon
me.' Why this change of pronunciation ?
Mrs. Whitloci is so much a favorite with
the Observer, that he is unwilling to leave
any thing, in her performance, uncorrect
ed. To be particular, in a recital of me
rit, in the performance of last. evening,
would exceed the reasonable length of this
lie etch ; The Observer is juftifiaLle ja fay
