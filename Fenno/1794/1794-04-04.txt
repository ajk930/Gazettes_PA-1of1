declares that all good citizens will haste to

This feftion gives great piaifc to Rou

Robespierre fays, Â«We are not to em,

quarrels between the members. The pub
lic papers are going to Jhew to all Europe
that these great successes, which ought to
have raised you totheikcnmitof enthusiasm,
have made so little impression on voujthat
you have done nothing but continue the
â¢uHe debates of thefittings of OSober.
" Pitt in his fright," thought that it
was all over with the abominable league of
kings, that the Jacobins were likely toeon
quer and make good use of their victories,
fcy endavouring to exterminate all tyrants
who have escaped from the vengeance of
the people; but he will have cause to re
joice When he learns, that if there is any
place where the successes of the Republ; â 
not produced any effect, it is in the
very club of the Jacobins.
Citizen Mamien sent details relative to
Bourdeaux, and the dispositions which
reign there ; he was not then fufficiently
acquainted with the circumllances.

that all the workiug materials have been re

Le Va(Teur fays so great is the merit of
the men truly born for the happiness of

try, even after they have ceased to exist.
Marat who well knew Dugomrriier ceased
not to recommend him to the patriots,#:it
was Dugommier who directed the plan of
the attack of Toulon ; therefore it is Ma
rat, who even after his death contributed
to the recapture of Toulon.
Le Clerc attributed these successes to
Robefpi-rre, who so energetically under

basely calumniated,by the tribunal of the
National Convention, by which he pre
served them for the nation.

Simon announced that the two reports c

For the Gazsttk of the United States.
MR. Fsnno,
The American people have formed their
just and.equal government, and have hi
therto condu&ed their national interests,
with such prudence, firmnefs and sense of
the blefiings which real liberty confers, as
to he a fair example to the whole world.
The principles which have been cheri(hed,
and the measures generally pursued by
the mass of the people, and those whom
they have entrusted with the management
of their affairs, clearly evince that they are
an enlightened people. They are not very
fit fubje&s therefore, for designing and
ambitious demagogues to practise upon
with success : they understand their prin
ciples too well, and are too firmly persuad
ed of the advantages of a government by
fair and full representation, to barter them
away upon the suggestions of felf-created
centinels of liberty, who attempt to ac
quire an improper influence, by a pom
pous display of wordy patriotism. 1 trust
it is in "vain, that certain turbulent indivi
duals organize themselves into Democrati
cal societies as they are called, act in am
bitious concert, and attempt to usurp an
influence over the public mind, which they
cannot hope to obtain if the people are left
to their own reflections and unbiassed de
cisions with regard to men and measures.
An undifcerning multitude, just emanci
pated from a cruel despotism and aristo
cracy, may require perhaps such' inltitu-
before they are matured in the .prin
ciples of rational liberty ; but they suit
not a people acquainted with those princi
ples from their birth, and by long experi
ence eltablifhed in a predilection for a Re
publican government by representation.
However, as the most unfair means and
themqft forward pretentions are exeicifed
and displayed at present to mislead the
public mihd, it is the duty of those who
feel an attachment ta real liberty and genn
int repullicanifm, to strip off the malk from'
pretended patriots, to avow thair senti
ments freely, and withstand the ufuipa
tions of a combination of men not delega
ted by the people, who pretend to speak
fn their name and assume their rights.
These pemocrate whilst they retail prin
ciples as excUifively theirs, Vrhith are uniÂ»
verfally adopted by the free citizens of
America, arrogantly claim a superiority
which is bv no means allowed, or even ,
compatible with their pretentions to de- 1
mocracy, and insidiously call in queltion
the republiGanifm of those who' differ from
them in certain political measures, and el
pecially with thole, who "have acquired the.
public confidence, and are employed in
those important trulls so which they them
ielves aspire. Hence those repeated char
ges of aristocracy, and repeated complaints
of " the amazing wantof Republican
principles and co;iuuÂ£t of our official cha
racters. Hence all those political affecta
tions that are forming under foreign auspi
ces, in various parts of United States,
and those political machinations which are
ierioufly moved to drfturb that fettled or
der of things in which the virtuous citizens
generally hud the repose and sweet enjoy
ment of liberty, after the toils and drag
gles endured in its edablifhment. It is
not liberty, but faction which organizes
and dire&s such democratic combinations ;
it is not virtue, but felf-intereil which
prompts the ambitions directors of these
fuparnumerary machines of freedom.
fn the General Advertiser of yetterday
morning, a writer who aflumes the ridi
culous and unmeaniug title of an Ameri
can Sans Culottes, pompously asserts what
no freeman denies, that " the government
of a republic, is the government of the
people, and tins government which is to
represent their interests and feelings is to
have no other rule of conduct than the ge
neral will."
refutations of the Democratic
Society of Charleltorj, published also yef
ertlay morning in the fame paper, we
ind the following feiJtiiÃsatfs stated with
is much warmth as if they were actually
:ontroverte<3 and threatened with arinihila
:ion : " the people of America know, that
rovernment was made only for them, they
inow that all power in the legislative and
;xecutiue j>jrt of government proceeded
from them ; that th y have not parted with
fheir freedom, by entrusting a portion of
power to a few individuals, and a right to
investigate the conduit of < hose whom they
have authorued, &o. This dodtrine 13 all
very true, and all the question is, who are
the people ? Are they a few felf-ereatedv
felf-interefted members of certain poFitical
clubs, or the mass of citizens throughout
the United States, who hare chosen by a
fair and free election,. Representatives to
appear in their behalf, and aÂ£t in their
name? If the latter statement be the truth,
who are the former ? And what must we
think of the candor, the modesty, the
truth of those who declaim against " s
want of republicanism in characters com
poling the highelt offices in the Federal
Government; ariftocratical pride and mis
taken ambition or of those who afTert,
that " it is' discordant to the sentiments
of some of our politicians, that the peoph
ought to regulate the proceedings of go
vernment and that measures in which
the people of America are universally a
greed, meet with opposition from some oi
their Representatives ?
When these men can (hew that a part
is greater than the >vhole, or that a few
individuals combined in party circles thro
the continent, are better entitled to re
gard, as the organs of the people, than the
men elected by that very people, we may
admire their, dexterity, but we ought to
fufpedt their ingegrity. I think they mult
have imbibed the spirit of the SansCulottes
at Paris, mentioned in Moore's Journal,
who said, "The National AfTcmbly ought
o obey our dictates','* (meaning the mob
)f Paiis) " since they are only the Repre
entatives of the people, whereas tve are
he people ourselves." On the contra-
I, and many thousands of my fellow-citi
zens fully agree with the following decla
ration, recorded by Dr. Moore, whict
the President of the National AfTembl]
made to a democrat, who took upon him
felf to ast in behalf of the people ; " Un
doubtedly the people is sovereign, but tlii
Fovereignty is in the whole people, and not
n any separate part, and cannot be exerci
cd, but by the Representatives of the
vhole nation.

Thuobfervations of Mr. Smith of South-
Carolina, on the palling of the bill for
the naval armament.
Mr. Smith remarked that though it
was not probable any proselytes were to
-be expected at this late period of the bu
siness and after so ample a difcuflion as the
question had received in its different Itages,
yet he coniidercd it neceflary to make a
reply to feme of the various objections
which had been just made to the paffinj*
of the bill. Many of those objections
appeared to him totally inapplicable to
the subject ; thole he thould pasÂ» over in
lilence. If it were the design of the
houte to incur a vÂ»ft 'eKpence in the eita
blifhinent of a navy, merely for the Mie
purposes of vain parade, there would be
mi -*â  â  \*
force in fbtne-of the objections, but as this
was not the cafe, and as the measure was a
meafui-e not of choice but of netjeffity ex
torted by the prefliire of unavoidable e
vents; he did not Feel their force m any
* refpecL The question was simply whe
' ther our commerce required protection a
rrainft the Algcrine coriairs, and whet her
tiws was the bed mode of protection.
The iirft part of the question was admit
ted on all fides; for himfelf, he had always
considered the frcond equally clear, but
ill the course of the difeuffion,_ various
divEcoltie. had been started againlt the
mode of protection, and various iublti
wtes had btw proposed, as offei ing a i e
medy more prompt, more effectual and
Ms expeafive. He would firft confide*
' the proposed substitutes for a naval araia
mait, and then answer the objections to
; t . The fubiiitirtes wereâl. I<> PjJJ r
chafe a peace of the Algerines. 2. To
depend on Portugal breaking her truce
wuh Algiers and (hutting up their crm
z<as within t Lie itreights. 3. To pass
cnramiercial regulations againlt Great Lu
tain. 4. To lubftdize other nations to
Dvutect our commerce. 1 o these ieveral
fobftitutes he might in a. few words objeCt
that the Grit was impracticable, tjielecond
precarious, the third inoperative, and the
ftxurth dithoiioraole. But he would more
in detail evince their futility by a few ob
tervations.
I ft. With .efpeft to the puichafe of a
peace, the hire commuhic-tions mull la
tisfv everv one who had attended to them
t" it ail hope on that score mutt be aban
doned, Wets there was a manifeftatton of
some force or. the part of this country
whichmijht gi.ce.Tcit to pacific negotia
tions. As long as our veflels were so easy
and so tempting a prey to the cupidity of
thoÂ£e rovers, tt would be 111 vain to expect
that they would fell a peace, for any thing
like the price which the governmeftt would
be willing to givft or that a peace, even
if effected, would be of any duration.
If the executive formerly experienced such
dHficnlties when the Algerines had captured
cniv one or two ot our vefle'.s and their ciui*
zers were confined to the Mediterranean by
the Portugese i'qtudron, how much leis
prospeCt was there of success after they had
captured a considerable number of our (hips,
were likely to capture many more and were
zi liberty to cruize in tire Atlantic, even to
O'jr very coasts : AnÂ«i that little prospect of
C ~ s fect*fc , wÂ«Â«M'be-Â«iia*>mfl>ed when the DeyotU.
Algiers lhoirkl ondeiftand that we took 110
. measures to protest our trade, and were afraid
of the expence of a small armament. Even
a peace be purchased, the temptation
to break it would be to great that we ought
not to expe<Â£t it would be long observed. But
if the Bev knew that we had some naval
ff.~CE.gth, and were resolved to proteCt our
trade, he would nad his account not only in
waking peace with us, but in main tailing it. j
1. To rely on the chance of Portugal
breaking her truce, was putting our com
merce and the liberty of our feamep on a
very precarious footing indeed. It was
irnpoffible to fay how long Portugal might
continue at peace with Algiers ; it had
been remarked that the truce had been ac
complished by the intervention of the Bri
tilh and Spanilh Courts, without the
knowledge or assent of Poitugal, but Mr.
S. was perfuSded the latter part of this
allegation was without foundation ; Por
tugal mud have consented to it, and it was
therefore prob&ble Ihe woiild maintain
peace with Algiers as long as the policy
of the British Court, with whom (he was
cl;Â».rly conneCtcd, should diCtate.
3. It was proposed to put a Hop to the
depredations of the Algerines by certain
commercial reftriCtiuns aimed at Great
Britain. Admitting, for a moment, the
ultimate efficacy of these reftritlians,
which, like a Panacea, were to cure all
our 1113, the remedy mull be very remote.
These regulations could not pass into alaw
till the feflion clofcd, allowing a moderate
time for their discussion in both houses ;
a dillant period must then be assigned for
their operation in order not to create too
sudden and violent a dillortioh to the
course of trade and to allow a reasonable
time to the merchants to make their ar
rangements ; a certain time must then e
lapse before their effeCt would be felt by
Great Britain, and still further time before
it could be felt, by a kind of re-aCtion,
by Algiers. In the interim the Algerines'
was'd seize our velTels and carry hund
reds of our fellow-citizens into captivity.
4. The lalt substitute was to subsidize
other nations. Besides the national dif
hor.orof depending upon others for that
protection which was in our own power,
Mr. S. said there were several objections to
this projeCt. Either the nations in con
templatiap were at peace with the Regen-
cy of Algiers or they were not: if the
former it was. not to be cxpefted that
they would. relinquijli that peace soY any
iiideinnilioation the United States could
make them. If they were at war they
had fnfficient inducement to check, tlie
depredations of their enemies without our
fublidies. In addition to these objections,
such a protection, would be hazardous, as
it would be at any time in the power of
the nation we should employ, when en
gaged thereto by any power, envious of
our piofperity, to conclude a truce with
Algiers and leave lis at the mercy Â»f her
' .
Having a navy of our own, we mignt
co-operate to advantage with any of the
powers at pre fen t at war with the Alge
rines but it would be Hiking 1 ' too much to
depend altogether on any of tlism.

ExtraA of a letter from John Bulkely and

dated January 25, 1794.
" Regarding the A'igerines, we are ad
vised from Gibraltar, and the ports in the
Streights, that they are all at home, and not
likely to attempt cruizing Huring these rough

o A letter dated Lilbon, 30th January,
from Mr. Humphreys, states, that there
i- is a probability that the truce with Al

renewed, on account of the exhorbitant
demands of the former, the result ot pend

Extrait of a letter from a ref'pe&able house
at Liibon, to their correfpondeni in this
city, dated January 27, 1794.
1 Â« Tho' we have lately had both an Eng
lish and Dutch convoy arrive with a good
I deal of wheat, prices have not come down,
nor do we think they will; especially if the
war with France continues, \yhich there is
1 every appearance of. It is ftippofed our mar-
I ket has a supply of grain for about three
I months;âthe beft'American wheat conti
nues in it from 560 to 600 reals per alquierâ
I and corn from '360 to 420 ; but this lait for
j the present, but little demand, tho' will soon
Ibe in great request; but prices of neither,
J we think, will advance above what we quote,
j Flour continues to be a prohibited article;
I and will only be admitted in cases of great
| necelhty. âThe American veflels that are
j now here, government has granted a convoy
I to ; and will fail in 10 or 15 days: and -we
Avail not be surprised to find the, truce with
I -Algtrines not confirmed, and that the
Portuguese squadron again takes its station
I in the Surahs."
I A genuine Copy of a letter from Messrs.
Bird, Savage & Bird, Merchants in '
London; dated London, 11th Jan.
J 17.94, to a gentleman in'this City,
j "Sir,
j " THE alterations are such as mull be
I fatisfa&ory to all parties, and there is now
I no reason to fear a rupture between out
j two countries ; for. though there still re-
I mains an impediment to your ships bring-
I ing the French colonial produce direst to
Europe, as such a voyage would not have
, I been allqwed by the French before the
war, and should only be now to avoid our
Cruisers, it can hardly be complained of,
I if our government impedes it.âThe rel-
I triftions not to supply ports actually block
-1 aded, and not to supply the French with
I naval or military Itores are founded on the
I acknowledged law of nations. You are left
1 ot liberty to supply the Islands in all other
I ,refpeÂ£te, which will give you an immense
j trade.âThe article relative to the bring
ing in ships loaden with French colonial
produce, the property of French fubjefts,
I is so explicitly worded, that if the captors
fail of proving the property French, they
will be fubjett to cost, damages and demur
rage, which will make them very cauti
-1 ous.
j We are Sir,
I Your humble servants,
BIRD, SAVAGE & BIRD."
*** This letter seems to contradict the
account given in their letter, published a few
I days ago, as to costs, &c. and is this letter
is closed the nth of January, it is probable
the former account was a mistake.

1 The Public are cautioned to
,C beware of counterfeited Five Dollar Bills e f
Jhe Bank of the United States, and Tquentj
. Dollar Bills of the Bank of North America,
â several of which have appeared in circulation
d within a few days pafl; they are a good ge
â s neral imitation of the genuine Bills, but may
be diflinguifhed by the fallowing
i. MARKS.
Five Dollar Bills of the Bank of the
United States.
h ALL that have appeared bavs the letter F.
j for their Alphabetical Mark.
The Texture of the Paper is thicker and
whiter and it takes the ink more freely than
" the gunuine paper.
The O. in the word Company is smaller
than the M. and other letters of that word,
so that a line extended from the top of the O,
to touch the top of the M would extend con
fideiably above the range of the whole word.
In the word United the letters are narrow
erand closer together than the reft of the bill
The i and fin the word promise are o.ot
parallel, theyinclining much more forward
than the i.
The engraving is badly executed,the ftr okei
of all the Letters are stronger and the devi e
in the margin particularly ismtich coÂ»i(Â»r nÂ»d
appears darker than in the true bills. Some
of the counterfeits bear date in l 791 âU'here-
â¢ as the Bank was not in operation till Oeceni
ber, and no five dollar bills were issued in
that year.
Twenty Dollar Bills of the Bank of North
America.
ALL that have appeared have the letter
B. for their alphabetical mark.
They are primed on a paper nearly similar
to that of the couuterfeit Five Dollar Notes
above (fcferibed ; the engraving is bettei exe
cuted, and they approach nearer to the ap
pearance of the genuine bills.
The line ruled lines through the word 7nrÂ»-
ty) in the body of* the bill, are in number thir
teen in the genuine Ulls, and but twelve in
the counterfeits.
The word Company is much like the fame
word in the Five Dollar B lis as defer ibed a
bove, the. 0 being less than them, and others
following.
There is no stroke to the t in the word Aforth.
whereas in the genuine bills the stroke is well
defined.
The letters ent in the word Twenty, to the
left hand at the bottom, do not come down ta
the line, but are so cut as to give an irregular
appearance to the word, the Tw and go
ing below th^rn.
The Signature J. Nixon, has the appear
ance of being written with lamp black and
oil, and differs fÂ»oin the other inks used in,
printing the bills and the c-alhicr's denature.
It is fqppofecj these forgeries were committed
in fomc ot the Southern States, as all the coun
terfeits that have appeared, have come .from
thence, and two peifoiis have been appiehend
