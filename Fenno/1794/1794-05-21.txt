THEATRE.
OBSERVER No. XVI.
Mr. Fenno,
The Theatre was last evening uncommon'
ly crowded, and with a brilliant audience.
The Observer was much gratified that Mr'.
Fennel's benefit waS lb properly noticed : his
powers were exerted with his usual propriety
in the charter of Count Ribemont; it is
the iincere wish of the Observer, that a man
of Mr. Fennel's character for virtue and abi
lities both natural and acquired, may neves
want the patronage of the public, of which
he received fd flattering a testimonial last
ni-jht.
Mrs. Oldmixon, again arretted the atten
tion of the audience, and exceeded the very
high expectation:, which had been entertain
ed of her as a Singer and an ACtreis: The
acquisition of Mrs. Olclmlxon, is a Angular
felicity to the Managers Of the New-Thea
tre, and is a great addition to the Company
of Performers, unquestionably an excellent
one before Hie joined them.
The pieces chosen were the Surrender of v
Calais, and a Peep into the Isfcraglio; the
d fpofitions of characters in those uncom
monly meritorious pieces, has done great ho
nor to the difcernmeut of the Managers. Mr.
Mofeton will exrufe the Observer for hinting
to him, the pain which his friends fe.-l at his
so frequently wanting aid from the Promp
ter.
Mrs. Marjhall, for a perfeCl simplicity,
and ease in a&ion, for a compleat adoption
: Â«i' the character file performs, has never ex
ceeded her exhibition of last evening.
In the after-piece, Mrs. Francis, Mrs. Old
mixo , Mils Broadburjl, formed a trio, that
gave the Observer many, not to fay full ideat
of perfection : He asks the Audience if they
could refrain from such ideas when they
saw and heard them ? Was there a heart
which did not expand with better sentiments
and more benevolence from attending the
perform nee last evening ? If there was one,
the Observer recommends a trial of This
Evening, at the Benefit of Mr. Chalmers,
which may poilibly prove a mutual benefit.
The entertainm-nt seleCted for this even
ing, is of the Left kind.

UNITED STATES.
ALEXANDRIA, May 13.
Copy Â°f a letter from a gentleman in Phila
delphia, to his friend in this town.
( Concluded.)
As to our navigation and commerce, we
can certainly defend it only in one of two
ways, either by maintaining a friendly cor
respondence with the maritime powers, or by
a powerful navy of our own.
As to the firft mode, at this time Great
Britain is mistress of the ocean. The prin
cipal maritime nations, except France, are
her allies. The court is holtile to usâthere
fore disposed to deitroy our navigation and
controui our commerce. It can be controll
ed only by the friendly temper of th? Bri
tilh people towards us. Our only chan:e, in
this way of defending these important inter
ests at this time, is to cultivate their friend-
Ihip.
As to the second mode, a powerful navyâ
the expense would be prodigious, the effica
cy uncertain. If however we do not defend
our navigation in one way or the other, in a
verv fliort time we Ihali not have a lh,p ou
the ocean. And indeed if we cannot defend
our navigation without a naval force ade- ,
quate to the objeCt, we ought to encounter
the expense of such an armament. I cannot
pretend to fay what naval force would be
adequate to this objeCt. A force less than
equal to tei} Ihips of the line, and as many
\ftcut frigates, would probably be very inade
ouate. I am, however, convinced that the
appearance of such a fleet always at our
command, could not fail to have a consider
able effect on foreign nations, especially if
the former jealoufits and rivaifhips thoiiid be
restored among the'powers of EuropeâAnd
when I refleCt how much within ou'r reach
are the rich Britifii Weft-Indies, I am inclin
ed to think that even preparations for such
a force,fuch as fortifyinggjthe proper port*
building arlenals aud docks, and laying in
plentiful supplies of naval It ores, might in
cline that government, more than any o
ther circumstance, to cultivate our friend
fliip. It is not probable that such a force
could be built and equipped for less than,
fix millions of dollars 5 nor when in aituÂ«
Ift v ce, annually maintained for less
than t ro; betides the expenses of an cf
tabli hment to defend the public works, ,
and superintend the naval btiiinefs of eve
ry kind. If, however, such a force
would fectirt to us <â  free cotnmerce and
fafe navigation, and the unfriendly difpo
iitionsof any of the great maritime pow
ers (hould compel us to resist it, it will be
better to encounter this expense than to
facrifice our trade altogether. As long
a 9 our commerce is supported, our exports
annually may be fully valued at twenty
millions of doliars. Suppofmg this value
should be reduced by the deftryction of
eur trade one half; this is a heavy tax on
the nation of ten millions of dollars
annuallyâand a tax, though it is drawn
from the pockets of the people, which is
not put into the public purse, but is a
cltai loss to the individuals and the nati-
oh. Such a state of things has also a ten
dency to discourage industry, and to in
troduce idleness with all its baneful attend
ants. If then the outfits of such a fleet
(hould cost ten millions of dollars, we (hall
lose nothing the firft year, and in every
following year we (hall have a clear additi
on to the value of our exports of eight
millions, over and above the two millions
destined to defray the annual expense of
the arrpament; or, in other words, we
fball take two millions annually from the
twenty millions, our exports, in order to
prevent the value of these exports from
being reduced to ten millions. .
, But it maybe said that we cannot raise
the money for such an armament j we
Can raise it in two ways, either by loan,
or by taxes. A Joan, it is true, will in
crea e our national debt; but if our fafe
tv and exigence require it, this objection
mult yield to the firii call of nature, felf
prefervation ; but a very great proportion
of the requilite lum might be raised by
tixes. At this time the United States
are rich and capable of a great exertionâ
provided a call for money is made before
the wealth (hall be difiipated, which has
been acquired by our late prosperous com
merce.
I think a general suspension of com
merce one of the greatest evils which can
happen to a nation. I have therefore en
deavoured to prove that it is better to en
counter a considerable expense thin fur
reuder it. It is probably in its effects as
bad, if not worse, than open war. In
war we might be able to retaliate on our
enemies the injuries which they did us.
Pending the negoeiation of Mr. Jay,
for the redress of the injuries we have fuf
fered from Great Britain, the most effec-
tual Way of aiding the negociation would
be to prepare for a refufal of justice, by
providing the Weans of defence, and par
ticularly by making ample preparations
for a marine defence ; for it is certain we
could not, in cale of a war with Great
Britain, defend our commerce in any de
gree without a powerful naval force ; and
perhaps a navy may be considered as the
most effectual guard from invasion.
I afri very sensible that, in other ref
peds, the southern dates are not so very
touch interested in the growth of Ameri
can navigation. Nature, climate, habit.
manners, and population have conspired
to render them unfit for this pursuit. If
a fuffieient number of vefTcls are found to
carry their surplus produce to market, and
they obtain a good price for it, they are
not in this relpeft very much interested
by what nation this is done. For this rea
son, therefore, the southern states might
rot feel themselves inclined to be at any
extraordinary expense to defend the navi
gation ; but such a surrender would be
ruinous to New-England. All circum
ftanees have combined to render them a
The ocean is their ele-
rnaritime people.
mentâit is their harvest field. It is the
duty of government to prated the interfft
of every part of tire fogietyâit is there
fore its anty to protect the navigation of
2\ew-England, on which its prosperity
depends, as well as the agriculture of the
southern dates. There are but two ways
of doing this- one by cultivating the
friend/hip of those nations, which having
the greatt ft maritime force, are moii capa
ble of injuring us, or by a powerful navy.
- :,e " r " ' s !^ie cheapest and most desirable
tr .ide the last ought however to bo re
sorted to in cafe the firft should hot be at
tainable. A seriouS question here occurs
to me, whether there be not a danger of
a frv ranee C.f the Union ; unless our na
vigation is protested ? Whether the east
ern stater v. ill not, under such circumftan
cÂ«, b. obliged to seek the friendfhip and
aiiiance of some nation able to protect it ?
t net'l not trace to you the consequences
of so deplorably an event, particularly to
which# however rich and ex
teniivs, can never become a maritime pow
â r. All circumstances our politici
ns ought to revolve seriously in their
ninds.
To a reflecting ftrtnger it mud a]
lingular, that measures, apparently c<L
ted to promote American navigation, which
is an object io interefting'toNew-England,
and to retaliate the injuries done to our
commerce in consequence of the orders of
the British court (and which injuries have
fallen principally on the people of that
country) should beoppofed by the eaflern
and urged with the mod vehement zeal by
the louthern states. The former think
that such measures would precipitate us
immediately into war ; and are therefore
disposed to try, in the firft place, the
peaceable mode of negociation to obtain a
redress of our injuries ; and to leave it un
fettered by any circumfiance which might
be used as a pretext by the British court
to evade judice, and induce hofl ilfties,
which would be ruinous to our present
prosperity.
It is certainly very fmgular that the
Southern States (hould have so eagerly
prert measures which, thofc most intcreft
ed, deemed fatal to the oljjedts which
they were meant to promote. I recollect
that it was one of the strongest objections
urged by some of the oldelt and ablefl
ftatefmln in Virginia to the adoption of
the present constitution, that <he eastern
states (as they supposed) forming a majo
rity in the legislature, would be difpoied
to encourage their navigation in such a de
gree as to fccure to theml'elves the mono
poly of our carrying trade, and thereby
be enabled to exact the molt enormous
freights for the transportation of the bulky
articles of the south, to the iiijury of the
southern planters. How different has
been their conduct from these anticipati
ons. It is the south which press such
measures, even to the hazard of a war.
It is the ealt which opposes them.
If a fair and temperate attempt to ad
just the differences between Great Britain
and us, by negociation should fail, thtn
felf preservation, then duty to ourielvcs,
duty to mankind, will jultify every
sure, even to sequestration of British debts,
by which our injuries may be retaliated,
and justice rendered to our citizens. It
is not probable that Great Britain, a na
tion accuitomed to war, and which for
the fervicc of the present year, raises a
revenue of one hundred andfifty millions of
dollars, and is mistress besides of the oce-
an, can be easily influenced by threats,
though her paflions and pride may be irri
tated by them. On the wfiole, therefore
I cannot help thinking, that in the pre
sent state of things, the eastern has been
the wisest and bell policy. We might
advantageously improve the time of the
negociation by providing revenues, and
warlike equipments, so as to be ready to
meet an appeal to arms if it Ihould be ine
vitable. 1 have however, a confident
hope, that the present differences will be
amicably adjusted, and peace established
on a firmer basis than ever, by tht mea
fores of the executive.
When 1 reflect on the relative circum
stance, of the eastern and southern states,
the former led by the necefiity of their li
tuation to navigationâthe latter invited
by their climate, their foil, and the value
of their produdioas to agriculture: the
one fitted to carry to foreign markets what
has been raised by the industry of the
other. 1 have viewed them as peculiarly
designed for mutual affiltance and accom
modation ; and to unite on terms of reci
procal interest. 1 have often been aito
mftied at the observation, that the eastern
and southern states had different intent,.
The fad is, they only have 'different pur
fiitls, which produce an unity intcrefts.
It would be the greatefl misfortune to
both, to separate. Their union is calcu
jated to nourish each othei's prosperity.
Yet, unless our navigation is proteded, a
separation may be inevitable.
The southern states from their habits
and peculiar circumstances, cannot flouri/h
without commerce; and they must fob- .
nut to have their produce trdnfported bv
foreign, .f American vessels are uot ena
bled by an adequate protection to do it.
t the eastern states cannot exist orprof
per, without their navigation, and they
must have it proteded, in so me way or o
-1 and if the United States do not pur
e mcafures adequate to this objed, they
may be obliged to seek its protection bv
a leparation, and foreign alliances. I hope
the united wisdom of our councils will
ward off an event so mifeh'rvous to our
mutual peace and happiness, and so much
to be deprecated.
I know it is said, that the French Re
public can, and will protect our commerce.
The faÂ£t, however, at this time, is, that
they cannot defend their own, nor their
foreign pofieffions, either in the Ea(t or
Indies. Nof- can we expedt that
they would defend our comtnerce, unless
we Entered into an offenlive and defenfive
alliance with them : which, in cafe of de
feat would involve us in their ruin ; in cafe
of their success from the superiority of
their power to ours, wouM leave us, un
der the name of allies, in a complete state
of political dependence on thetu. This,
I heartily pray, may never be our fate in
refpeft to any nation.
Being the happiest people in the Uni
verse, and undev circumstances the molt
favorable to the continuance of our happi
nessâit is time to avoid.all foreign politi
cal connexions, which can only serve to
involve us in the broils and contentions
which defolite the reft of the World. Be
sides, it is (till uncertain what form of go
vernment France will, finally afiiime.â
They have at present no regular govern
ment. The confutation which they fram
ed, they have not yet ventured to put into
aiSfion. Their present government is re
volutionary. It is suited for the occasion
only ; for this it seems peculiarly fitted.
It has in the most astonishing manner, call
ed forth the energy of the nation to repel
their unjust invaders ; and has demonstra
ted to the world, that France cannot be
subdued by foreign force.
The United States are certainly differ
ent from the reft of the world, in refpeft to
thediftributionof real property among their
citizens. Every induilrious man here may
become an independent pofleffor of land.
This single circmnftance gives to our peo
ple a spirit of liberty, and an independence
of chat after peculiarly fitted for the main
tenance of a republican government. All
Europe is m a different situation ; and it
is probable that even in France at this
time, five-fixths of the people have no hold
on the foil, .except in the character of de
pendent tenants. Our circumstances are
more independent, and consequently our
manners more free, and more pure than
the reft of the world. Our happiness is
complete, if we will avoid foreign broils,
and confine our attention to the carc of
our own intereits. Our true policy is to
cultivate peace by all poffibie means ; but
at the fame time to prepare for war. While
the negociations of our envoy extraordina
ry are pending, as i have before observed,
the time of our Government would be
ufefully employed in such preparations.
If we have peace, as I expect, the funds
destined for war, might be applied to the
redemption of our debt : and, if we have
war, we should be ready to meet it. In
either event, the bill totally rejeded by
the Senate, would be unnecessary. If we
have peace, the causes of our complaint
will be removedâWar from its nature
will destroy that commercial intercourse
between the two countries, which the bill
was intended to effedi.
Much noise is made about the retention
of the Western Posts by Great Britain.
With regard to this fubjeft, and generally
the fulfilment of the treaty of peace, there
are mutual recriminations between that
country and us. But though I think they
are unjustly detained from us, I do not
view them as an object of so much confe-
quence, as to juftify war to obtain them,
fime, and the progress of our settlements,
will in a few years, give us pofTeflion of
them without striking a blow. We have
already more territory than 'we can defend,
and more people than we can govern, or
than will obey us. ,
I have thus given you a concise view of
my ideas, the result of my best reflections
on the present interesting fuuation of our
political affairs, and remain, See.

Gentlemen of the Grand Jury ! â¢
WE are now aflembled in obedience to
the law's; and it affords rue pleafiire to be
among you. Happy. Ihould J feel were this
the only business ot the court. Bat error is
incident to human nature; and mjfatpre
/" d dlforders will arise under even
e best systems of government, and in the ;
belt regulated state of focety. baj, c*, I
only be correal by the due admmift ration
â  of whoklome laws. Hence the fecial com .
, p*ft was fought for ia the earliest aVes â¢ a,,!<
man parted with a portion of his natural
rights to preserve in security the remainder
Oovern mrnts were framed: laws were ma t"
for the common benefit-and proteÂ«Â£Koâ Â» M
hence afforded to the perfor.al liberty tC
lives and the property of every ind'vidaal
I bus the weak were protected ng.unlt the
llrong ; the poor were guarded against 0D
predion from the richâwhile the vicious o~
all descriptions were, rellrained from 'the
commiflion of crimes.
Human happiness, both public and private
has ever be n an object important aid inter'
eftmg to man. Without happiness, life would
be a burden: but happinels cannot be cb
tamed without the poffefiion of liberty â
anc! to secure this, the necciiity of reflrainin?
rules must be evident to you allârules tha
while they dif?ountenaiire vice, promot- vir'
. tu , e , and us to those silken trammels
ii- which reason imposes, virtue approves and
jit expediency requires. Thus a diftinchon na
turally arises between Liberty and Licenf
tj cioufnefs. The one is a curse o/ the ' - eat *
. eft magnitude, and may always be found
among men in a state of nature: the oth-r
ns is the bnghteft gem of a well regulated
e " vernment. It is the mark o refined evil,
o- zation, and can never be too highly valued
_ Impress it for ever on your minds, that where
n- Licen.cioufnefs is permitted, Liberty mult
droop and finally die ! 1 hey cannot live to
gether.
to Happy are we, Gentlemen, who live in an
e " a sÂ« io enlightened as the present. The mists
m of ignorance are nearly difpdled, and im pe .
J. I nal-reafon begins to resume herfway. The
tl- ""deritanding appears to be fleetly acproxi
A to that state which belt c S n l^beral
- - IZe M , â¢* d ' Â® n f ' eadl the heart " good
' ' to a]l men - ' A salutary admtniftration
of the laws must haftcn the defirabl,- crisisâ
. and much, gentlemen, will depend uponvdur
r- exertions by the due tfifcharge of the iruft
0 of r ' Â° UI co,,ntr y has confided to you.
" Before 1 pass on to Â» few oblervations res
pecting your duties, fuffer me, gentlemen, to
1 congratulate you upon the peculiar advan
â¢ tages of our local f.tuation. Far removed
from the fripperies and corruptions of the
e old world; blessed with the Dofletfion of a
'â¢ AC fertilc > and climates no left

tl P ' framing a future government on the
g purest principles of polity, and Of transmit
ting to millions yet unborn blessings known
cm j to 1: ee men j what, then, have we to
'- tearâbut our own imperfections! what
e have we to courtâbut our own happiness!
r J must now cail your attention to matters
1 more affecting the obietfs of
s ou^P refe 1 nt meeting: And firftâwith res-
I peCt to the nature and use of lurks, their
' I rights and duties.
* I A Jury, then, is formed of a convenient
J 1 number of citizens, felcdted for their probi- "f
L ln, P 3rt ' a ' ! ty and general competencyâ
; ihey are vested with a discretionary power
- tÂ° try the truth of fatts affecting the liberty,
the lives, the reputation and the property of
' their fellow-Citizensâa sacred trust indeed 1
In its general nature I would fay, this dis
cretionary power is a power to try the truth
> ot fadts ; and the truth of facts must be
; I tried by evidence.
â  According to the nature and cifcumftan
i ces ot every tafe, a Juryman will estimate
in his own mind what he believes ; and also
what he does not Relieve, because infuiÃc'i-
I entlv proved.
II -ught with the wisdom of immemorial
ages, the common law proceeds upon the
lame principle. The qualifications and so
lemnities it prescribes, as to witnesses (and
testimony is the principal evidence before
I Juries) are directed to competency ânot
j credibility ; to admifiion of what is offered â
not to the operation of what is heard.
I tender, gentlemen, of the reputation
and feelings of your feliow-citizens. Chil-
I dren of the lain-.' beneficent parent, they
form a part of the fame great family with
yourselves.'âThey have feelings, like you ;
and, like you, are in the pursuit of humait
happiness. Whatever tends wantonly to im-
I peoe or impair that happiness, is injuftiee
I to the injured, an offence against society and
j the law. " Do unto others as you would
j they (hould do unto you"âis a rule lacred
j for its excellence. Suffer no frivolous nor
I vexatious accusation to excite, your notice;
I but then let no real offender escape the ope-
I ration ot the laws. The peace and security
I of society require these things of you ; and
j your country demands then., as effehtials of
your duty.
I It behoves you difpaflionately to weigh
I in your minds whatever may officially be
I laid before you, by the gentleman profectit
ing the pleas of the United States : like
wise, to take under your notice such v'oJa
| tions of the law within your county, as
may otherwise happen to come to your
knowledge. For remember, that the object
of youi meeting is to serve a community
which cails yon brothers. That commun
ity will expect from you (and which doubt
less you A'ill render) the moll fjrupu.jus,
and confciericious discharge of your func
tions.
T he generr.l fundHons of a Grand Jury
conljfl in making enquiry into every charg
of criminality that (hall lie brought befor
%them, on behalf of the Territory, in the
nÂ«ftne of the United States.
! As a bill of indigent amounts only to
a deJaration, that the pary 0113 it o
put upon his trial, it is held. that evidence
on behalf of the prosecution, 's. all
that a Grand JuT may require. But then
excercife the greatefl Circum
you ought to exicruiv i * _
Wfcion as to the teihmony altered ; and
to be thoroughly P erf "^ ed ) of t ! le m " h Â° f
it, before you procecd to find a bi..âwhich,
ill found, might temporarily involve the
reputation andinterefts of a worthy ind.vi-
uul. ,
As you are bound by oath to enquire on
ly for a particular county, the county in
which you are, you cannot regularly, en
tire of a fa& done out of that county.
To so great a nicety was this doctrine for
merly carried in England,that where a per
son was wounded in one county, and died
in another, the offender was indi&able in
nekber, at common lawâno compleat ast
of felony being committed in either county.
In finding an mdiÂ£lment, it is your duty,
gentlemen, to findgmerally, and not speci
ally. You mull either declare ' A true
Bill,' or ' No Bill'âand this without ad
dition or condition.
OfFences(if any such there be)againft
the ast prohibiting and suppressing every
species of gaming, will, no doubt, claim
and receive your particular attention. I
give yonthe ast itfelf particularly in charge,
conformably to the duty it imposes on me.
Suffer me, gentlemen, to call up your at
tention to fenfiments on wliich 1 have al
ready enlarged. They can hardly be too
often repeated.âOn all occasions let your
care be equally directed tq the detection of
the guilty, and the protection of the inno
cent. Coniiderj on the one hand, how
nearly the fafety of the good, is cortnefted
with the punishment of the bad; and, on
the other, how liable to wifreprefentation are
theaftions of men.

COPENHAGEN, March 18.
We can now mention with certainty,
that a fleet is fitting out at the Holm ; it
is to consist of 8 ihips of the line and 4
frigates. It is reported that the differ
ent commanders are already appointed,
though they are not yet publickly known
âit is thought that those of the 8 ships
of the line are Commodore Winterfelt,
, Captains fading, Ramfhardt, Raphael,
Sondcr, Otto Lytly n> Uurfin, Chriflian
Lytken, and Olfert Fisher ; and for the
4 frigates, Captains Soyer Abo, Steen,
13ille, Obeltiz, and Ooldenfeld. Of the
(hips fitting out the following lift is given:
Neptune 84, CrownPrinee, Princess Ma
ria, Sophia Fiederica, Three Crowns, of
44 each, the Louisa Augusta, Ifods Ret
ten, and Mars of 64 each. The frigates,
Thesis of 40, the Triton and 8 others of
24 guns.
NIGGA, February 26.
The Comrniffioners of the Convention
and the Generals have daily conference in
order to fix upon the place of operations
fur the ensuing campaign. The army of
the Alps is reckoned at 12000 menâ
1000 whereof are intended for the siege
or Saorgis. The transport of the heavy
artillery has already commenced, large
magazines are established, the firfl requi
sition is called out, and the national do
minions have been fold for treble the sum
of what they had been rated at.
BRUSSELS, March 15.
All the motions and preparations which
the combined armies have made on the
frontiers are only on the defenfive, occa
iioned by the enemy drawing their troops
together. It is known from good autho
rity, that in the councils of war held
here and at Mons, it has been agreed up
on, that the combined armies shall not
begin to ast until the great reinforce
ments which are expected from Germany
and England (hall liave arrived. It will
therefore certainly be half April before
we can ast on the offenfive.
The French in the mean time seem to
Redetermined to open the campaign with
a general attack, which is to be made
irom the furthermoit frontiers of Lux
embourg ~ until the sea shore at the fame
time ; our Generals therefore take all the
nscenaiy precautions to cover our fron
tiers.
of the French army
of the Mozehe, drawing itfelf towards
D.edenhofen ; a corps of Auftrians has
been Cached from the county 0 f Namur,
in order to reinforce the fmill army of
General Beaulieu, who has taken hij head
â¢ quarters at Arlon. The greateit part of
the English army marched on the
in It. from Cortyk to Menin, bccaulo thts
place is threatened with an attack from
the French, who draw together near Lin
celles. The Duke of York held lately a
general review of the English arrtiy, and
gave orders to change its position. Ac
cording to appearance, the English army
is'to occupy a poll of conference, be
hind the river Lys.
Since the beginning of last week about
1000 new Auftriari cavalry have paflcd
through here and a corps - of 6ao is ex
pected every day at Shrinen ; here and in
all other cities it is amaziftg full of stran
gers; government has therefor? taken ve
ry severe measures; all 'thoi'ellrangers that
cannot legitimate themselves are looked
upon with a very jealous eye. A strong
corps of Hanoverian troops is expe&ed
here this day.
P. S. This moment we received a let
ter from Cortyk vdiich mentions that the
engagement which took place between
the French & the English near Werwick
had been a very bloody one, and that the
English had taken a good many prison
ers of the French, as likewise some pie
ces of cannon. This letter mentions
likewise, that the armed peasants took
the enemy in the rear, and thereby great
ly contributed to the advantages which
have been obtained.
PHILADELPHIA,
MAY <21.
There is a letter in town which con
tains information that three companies of
British troops under the command of Col.
Simcoe, Governor of Upper Canada,
have lately taken post near the Rapids of
the Miami of the Lakes.
Peace with.all the world, is undoubt
edly the policy and the wifli of every wife
and honest Citizen of the United States.
But in the course of human events, such
is the avarice and cupidity of nations as
well as individuals, that it may become
the duty of a people to rifle its very exis
tence as a community in supporting its
rights aud independence. Whether such
a solemn crisis is now impending, time
will soon determine. May our civil fa
thers be wife to discern and pursue the
solid interests of this infant Republic at
this eventful period.
From Correspondents.
If the liberties of this country are to be
deftroyedâllo fitter instruments can be pro
vided than felf created Legislators, who owe
no responsibility to the people.
If the liberties of France are now,or ever
have been in jeopardy since the commence
ment of the revolution of that country âthe
danger has arisen not from the rcprefentatives
of the people, but from those societies who
have controuled their deliberations, and have
\didlated the public measures.
The reprefentativj-s of the people arc
knownâbut who knows the members of
those clubs who have aflumed the dielator-'
Ihip of the United States ?âSo far as they
are known, merely as citizens, who ivouid
transfer their confidence from the represen
tatives of the people, to place it on these
men.
These societies are profefled enemies to,
and openly reprobate every important mca
fure of the government of this country. â
Hcnce arises a competition for influence,
which is but another name for powerâthe
end of trhefe things, in the natural order of
events, is death to the liberties ol" America.
There are certain men in public life in
this country, who are macle the objects of
perpetual abuse to the diforganizers of the
dayâlet uncommon attention be paid to the
public character of these menâit is shrewdly
.fufpefted that it will be found, that uncom
mon merit, gives rife to this pointed abuse.
No greater sign of depravity can exilt, than
to be the favorites of the calumniator. of our
government.
The olive branch and the fivord âthese
comprize the politics of the real friends of
this country.
A nettle, and an empty fcaiboard âthe
politics of the diforganizers. -

in King flan, Jamaica, dated 12th April,
to their comfpondent in this city.
" I am extremely sorry for the difcoti
ragement, and 1 cannot help adding, the
very unfair treatment that the merchants
of your State met with in their intercourse
with our new possessions in St. Domingo ;
it hasarifen from indiltinft orders, having
been issued by the Lords of the Admiral'

Naval commanders in these fedfc.
"1 think I can with certainty fay that
an end is now put to that evil, but am
apprehensive that you have already felt it
so severely as to have been induced to leave
off that trade entirely ; to remove this
unfortunate impreflion as far as possible,
I have requtrftcd the Governor of this
Island to write circular letters to the Brit
ilh Consuls in the different Ports of Ame
rica, assuring them, that not only the
Ports of this Island, but those of our

Of Charlotte, the Reviewers have given j
the following character.
IT may be a Tale ol- Truth, for it is oot
unnatural, and it i , a talc of real d'iltrefs.â
Chariot* e, by the irtifice of a teachei, recom
m nded to a fcho'ol, from hnmanity rather
than a Convi&ion of her integrity, or the re
gularity of her farmer condnft, is enticed
from her governed, and accompanies a young
â >mcer to America.-âThe marriage ceremo
fly, if not forgotten, is pollponed, and Char
lotte dies a martyr to the ioconftancy of the
over, and treachery of his friend âThe litu
tions are artless and affectingâthe
ations natural and pathetic ; we should â¢<=>â¢

who for one errqr scarcely, perhaps, deserved
so severe a punifliment. If it is a fidtion,

AN ESSAY ON THE

Aliquid Temper ad communcm utilitatem af

The Firjl American Edition.
THEgrand principle of Equality, if right
ly underftoodj is (he only bafi-, on which
universal jnltice, faced order, and perfect
freedom, can be firmly built, and permanent
ly secured. The view of it exhibited in this
efTay, at the fame tiuiethaE it repreJies the
insolence of office, the tyranny of pride*,' and
the outrages of oppression ; confirms, in the
most iorcible manner, the neceffirv of subor
dination, and the just demands of lawjul.au
thority. So far indeed, from loofenirg the
bands of society, that it maintains inviolate,
every natural and every civil d:ilindboh,
draws more clo'ely every Ibcial lie, unites in
one harmonious and justly proportioned lyf
tem, and brings men together on the even
ground of the inherent rights of human na
ture, of reciprocal obligation, and of a cum
mfon relation to the community.
