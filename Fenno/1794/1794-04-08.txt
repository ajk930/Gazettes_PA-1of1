To learn fubmifiion, modesty ?

so long to blot and write and write and

also to shew, that all the time from the

writing, but in diiappointments by the
obstinacy of Printers. But finding how

Mr. Fenno,
BY Mr. Z. the orator's reply to my ad
dress to you the other day, he seems to have
got out of his leading firingsâand being now
arrived to the state of manhood, he comes
forward a bold hero to support men and
measures calculated for piblic uffulnefs. â
Happy, thrice happy Americaâwho in this,
thy adopted son, hath lo able a supporterâ
not only in thy Councils, bnt in the war
which he so anxiously desires; it may be
expected ((hould it fortunately for him and
a few of his speculating friends take place)
that he will lead thy armies to battle âand,
like Scipio of old at the gates of Carthage,
carry his thunder to the walls of Quebec â"
which mull crumble to the dull at his ap
proach.
Having thus presaged the future exploits
and glory of this truly patriotic orator, give
me leave Mr. Fenno, through the channel
of your paper, to liy before the public a few
remarks on the little details he gives us of
his eminent services in the late war.ââ¢With
great gravity he tells us 'n the firft place,
that in J7Bl, he was appointed receiver of
taxes for Pennsylvania, and Treasurer to the
department of f nance âin which stations of
great importance, he was happy in lending
his aiding hand in the franfaÂ£tions which led
to the peace of 1783" âAdding, that ever
since he has been employed in aflive life,
and extenuvc scenes of commerce, beneficial,
at once, to the country and liiinJVli'.
Vain presumptuous man ! âthus to arro
gate to thyfelf the mer'.trefulting from tranf
aiftions due only to thy guardian angel, the
financier âwho among many other adts of his
benevolence towards you, placed you under
bis own direflions in both offices âholding
himf If rrftonfble ior your conduct in themâ
and all :wmg you a commifpon on your re
ceipts ai;t? expenditures, which laid the cor
ner /lone oj our present fortune âand of the
consequence you no<w afume âWhat claim
then can you pretend to have to the public fa
vor for these services of which you boast so
much ?âreverfe the matter, if you please,
and honestly confefs that you fer-ved your/elf
aloneâwhich in every cafe is the rulingprin
ciple with you.
The orator, Mr. Fenno, to shew his early
attachment to the cause of American Inde
pendence, tells us that in the year 1777, he
took the oath of allegiance to the govern
ment âto this I (hall fay with Hudibras,
thatâ r
It is he who makes the oath that breaks it,
Not him who from convenience takes it.
His loyalty being thus put out of the question,
he concludes by telling us " that in his inde
pendent career neither the -venom of private
malice, nor the rage oj public faSions shall
interrupt him"âGo on my truly patriotic
orator âgo onâyou are secure from bothâ
for you are not yet arrived to that degree of
consequence in the world, to excite either
private malice, or come under the serious no
tice of any party âbut when next you mount
the rostrum, I think you will do well to
confine your oration within the bounds of
modestyâand learn, if you can, a little grati
tude to the country which gave you birth,
and to a nation which has been so generous
to vour father.

The excursions of the Prince of Ssxe
Cobourg to Guise and St. Quintin, have
concluded molt unfortunately. On Thurs
day last the two columns were attacked at
the fame moment, with fiush impetuosity,
that they were both forced to retreat to
their old positions between Valenciennes
and Quefnoy. There came in here last
night, by the gate of Ancfcrlecht, an

" J. B. Lacofte and Baudot, representatives

and jVLlelle, to the Naional Convention.
" Hiad-quarten at Nuairhrum, Dec. 11.
" The defenders of the republic, citizens
colleagues, have just obtained a iignal victory
over the Auftrians. Yoji know that the sa
tellites of the kings, relying more upon the
strength of their cannon than their own cou
rage, had intrenched themlelves upon the
heights of Reichfhofen, Genderfhofen, pe
chevillers, and Werth, before Haguenau, re
doubts of three Itoiies, not less formidable
those of Jemappe
" The front of their intrenchments was
attacked this morning with the greatest suc
cess. The soldiers of the republic took 26
pieces of cannon from the enemy, 20 tum
brils, and made upwards of joo prisoners,
among whom is the colonel of the firft re
giment of the emperor, bedecked and covered
with crofles and ribbands, and eight other
officers. The number of their killed is very
considerable ; we would not make any pri
soners till we were tired of killing ! Our !oi
-I'es have been but trifling.
" It would be too long to give the details
of all the prodigies of valour on the part of
our brave soldiers ; their fucceifes repref-nt
them better than all we might fey: the gene
rals, in other refpe<fts, will be eager to give
you all the military particulars. This vic
tory is the more important, as it is the open
ing which will condudl us to Landau.
" We have been all day long in the field
of ba'tle with our brothers in arms.âWe
ourselves discharged the cannon upon the
enemy ; and it (hall not be our fault :f this
victory is not followed up without relting,
and with the greatest ardour.â

sed to expel Marat from our focietv. Is
such a man worthy to fit among us ? I
move for the endure of his name from the

" 1 do not confine myielf to this sole
denunciation. I accuse Philippeaux, who
has sometimes the impudence to come to
deliberate with the Jacobins. He has writ
ten works which ought to exclude him
from our bosom.
" 1 accuse Camille Defmoulins, who
formerly could render great service to the
Repuhlic. Since he has married a wo
man who brought him a certain fortune,
he thinks he may despise the true Jaco

tociats and Mufcadius, with whom by his
own confeffion, he lives upon familiar
terms. He proteas Dillon : He believes
T urenne to be a man of fupenor genius.
He kept silence for some time; and now
he only takes up the pen to devote Bou
chotte to ridiculeâBouchotte, whose pa
triotism cannot be queitioned. He said
in his journals, that George Bouchotte
was governed by Pitt Vincent. Is Bou

CHAMBER of COMMERCE.
New-York, April I ft, 17.94.
THZ Committee appointed by thits
chamber at their lalt monthly meeting,
u to report their opinion 011 the general
Hate of oiir commerce and of the mea
sures which are proper lor thu corporation
to pursue," beg leave to coin nunicate the
fallowing statement as the rei'alt of its en
quiries founded on the mâft authentic ob
tainable evidence.
TTlat the Algerine Corsairs have almost
totally interrupted our trade with Spain
and Portugal, and the various diftritbs
within the Mediterranean : Those coin
tries having generally afforded good mar
kets for jur produce, our future commerce
with them must be carried on through die.
medium of foreign bottoms, unlets w
can either make peace with those barbari
ans, or furnifh a naval force fufficiently
powerful to defend our trade *-lain It tiicir
depredations. An appreheniion of dan
ger from these corsairs has had a tendency
to advance seamen's wages, and to raise
freight and insurance on our vc: els to the
more northern parts of Europe. Ameri
can Slips, entirely loaded with the proper
ty of our own citizens, hive been afceiv
h'v commissioned by the B 'i
nation, and condemned as lawful pr;:,-s,
although known at the time of cond.m
nation to be bona fide American propeay.
UaneceflVy walte appears in many â¢ s
to have been made, and articles of value
have been forcibly arretted oil the high
seas From vefTels which were afterwards
permitted to proceed on their voyages.
A general interruption is now experienced,
by the interposition of Britilh armed ves
sels, in ourcommerce not only with France
and her colonies, but, in many instances,
where our ve.Tels have been ck-(lined to
neutral ports, and in some cases when they
liave been bound to Britilh ports direct
from America or from one Britilh Illand
to another.
American vefiels have ajfo been taken
by French ships of War and some cargoes
litve been condemned as the property of
tu-thrfren-l). An Km
bargo on many of our merchantmen has
for several months been laid in ports be
longing to the Republic of France. Pro
visions have been taken at stated prices and
paid for in depreciated paper. The ex
portation from France of molt of its pro
duce and manufactures has been interdict
ed and'thai of specie prohibited. In some
cases the cargoes of our vefTels have been
exchanged by those in authority in the
French colonies for bills on the minifler of
the Fiench Republic in the United States,
many of which bills have not been paid
nor has any provifiqn been made for their
discharge; and the cruizing (hips of
France have orders to take all neutral vef
f;ls loaded with provisions and bound to
the potts of any of the powers at war
W'th her.
Tln'i general interruption of our com
merce has in molt instances been contrary
to juftite, and we have fultained many los
ses which it was hoped our neutrality
would have exempted us from.
The constitution of the United States
having veiled in Congress the power 1 of re
gulating trade, it is our duty to look up
to that body, as the representative of the
nation, for indemnification for palt, and
protedtion againlt future lodes.
Your committee therefore recommend
that the following resolutions be adopted
as the sense of this corparation, viz
" Refijlved, That it be eameltly re
commended to all pirfons, citizens of the
United States of America, who may
have full,lined any loss in their property
on the friph seas, or in foreign ports, by
privateers; or other armed velfels belonging
to, or cojnmiflioned by either of the pre
sent European belligerent powers, that
they make report of such cases, with well
authenticated evidence of the truth of
facts, to the committee appointed by this
Chamber, in order that the fame may be
transmitted to the fecretarv of state, for
the purpose expiefied in his letter of 27th
August last, addressed to this corporation."
" Refojved, That this Chamber enter
tain the h if rheft sense of the integrity and
wisdom ot the Congress of the United
States, and are fa;i.sfied that every exer
tion will bo made to support the honorand
true dignity thereof against any and every
