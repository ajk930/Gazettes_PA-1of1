Mr.BACHE,
A writer in your paper of Thursday,
who communicates to' the public, two re
solutions relative to Mr. Jay's appoint
ment as "Envoy to England, observes, that
he had been informed that a majority of
the Senate appeared to be of opinion, that
it was not compatible with the character
of Judge, to accept the office of an Envoy,
*but that/ the friends of Mr. Jay secured
his appointment,- " by Urging, that his de
licacy and sense of .propriety, would cer
tainly induce him to resign his office of
Chief justice, when he (hould accept the
' " A Correspondent who
pofTelles accurate inforrflation of what pas
sed in the Senate on this occasion, denies
the allegation that the friends of Mr. Jay,
declared it to be their opinion that he
would, or ought to, resign his office .of
; Chief Justice.
A Senator from an Eastern State, is
said to have observed, that Mr. Jay's being
Chef Jufti6e. constituted no objection to
his appointment to another office ; fop in
cafe of incompatibility, the former would
be resigned, adding that probably he
would resign the office of Judge if appoint
ed Envoy.
This unpremeditated conjecture, was
exprefiitd by no other Senator, nor is it
believed that it had any influence in Mr.
Jay's appointment.
It is a just principle that offices, the
duties of which interfere with each other,
ftiould not be conferred upon one man ;
but the difficult fituatisn of public affairs,
the peculiar nature of thebufmefs, and the
acknowledged fitnefs of a particular cha
racter, will juftify an occasional, and tem
porary departure from this general rule.
A Judge of the Supreme Court is an as
sociate officer ; an Envoy Extraordinary,
is a character employed for a (hort time,
and upon an urgent occasion : The judi
ciary department will proceed* (hould one
of their corps be engaged a few months as
an Envoy Extraordinary and the precedent
will not prove injurious.
Those know little of Mr.- Jay's private
character, who insinuate that avarice ii a
passion, that harbours in his bosom ; his
friends will have no cccafion to regret his
want of delicacy, in respect to what some
may have deemed an object, the pecuniary
emoluments of this appointment. Mr.
Jay is neither " alieni appetens, nec fui
profufus, " plain republican manners, and
oeconemy, distinguish his public, as well as
private life.

The TIMES, No. VI.
New-England people turned ariftocratal
fay the southern gentlemen. This is v<ly
Let lis exarfjine the faÂ£l,and cpm
pare New-England ariltocracy with
ther.ii democracy An eaftera aristocrat
is a New-England farmed Nine oCit of
ten of all these people are men of fftiall
landed consisting of from 50 to,
200 acres of land, and worth from 1000
to 3000 dollars. There is not one in
twenty of theiri that ever owned a (lave ;
and those who hstve them are getting rid
of them as fail as they can, without in
jury to the slaves. The farmer himfelf,
his wife, his sons and daughters all labor
in pcrfom, oh the farm or at the spinning
wheel. A farmer in New-England who
does got labor in person, is no more to be
found than.a planter in Virginia or Caro
lina who does. If they have occasion to
hire men, they aflociate with
them, arid eat..at the fame table. In a
whole village there is little or no distinc
tion of rankâthe and mechanics,
the justice of peace and thd blacksmith
all aflociate on equal terms. There is nb
such. thing a3 a farmer's commanding his
workmenâhe treats them all as his equals.
These people are generally very civil and
obligingâthey make bovfrs to each'other,
and teach their children to do the feme.
This is New-England aristocracy. r
Virginia democracy is a very different thing
âA democrat in the southern states is. a
planter, or other perfion, who owns a
large number of slaves; who is above.la
bor himfelf, and _not only so, but is above
the diudgery of oyerfeeing his own busi
ness. He commits it to a steward and a
negro driver. He eitabliflies all the ranks
of the feudal system in his own family.
The planter is king, or tord paramount
âhis children are noblesâ-the tutor, the
{teward and clerk are the commons' âand
the laboring people and blacks are the
vaflals. Yet this planter is a mighty de
mocrat âa warm (tickler-for the rights of
menâfor libertyâand what is more, e
' quality. This little domestic monarch
writes and spouts inceflantly about the
funding system and the danger of power.â
He will not laborânot heâ-.that is the
business of slaves.âHe will not aflociate
with laboring peopleâhe will not eat at
the fame table. His sons must not labor,
this would difgracc themâ"they are seen
at a tavern from morning to night, saw
ing on a fiddle, and playing at billiards.
A New-England artflocrat, on Sunday
puts saddle and pillion on his team-horse,
takes his wife behind him, and his child
on a pillow before him, and rides to
church, and when he gets home, he reads
a sermon, or a chapter in the Bible, and
teaches h(s children some catechism.
The fouthem democrat on Sunday gets
into his coach, if he has it, or can borrow
one, and accompanied with two or three
dirty, ragged* half naked slaves, rides to
/ some friends, or to some amnfement. It is
idle to deny these thingsâthousands of eye
witnefles can attest them. Let the truth then
be acknowledged. Let the charge of ari/lo
oracy fall where it ought. The northern
people are the mod democratical in the uni
verfe âequality reigns among them in reali
ty âbut they refpeft law and order, and when
they have a government, they wish to keep it.

COPENHAGEN, March I.
About four o'clock last Wednesday
evening, an alarm of fire was given from
the palace. It firll appeared in tfye upper
{lory of the south corner of the fiont fide,
which'is to the westward ; and, although
every endeavor was used to extinguish the
flames, they soon began to spread to the
northward. About half past fix the Royal
family were told that little or no hopes of
favtng the palace were left: they retired
to another quarter of the town.
The flames were affilted by a frefh gale
of wind from the fouth-ealt, and about
half past eight the spire was burnt down*
At ten o'clock, the whole boc!y of this
immense building was in a blaze, which
at once exhibited a very grand but awful
scene In Ihort, the whole palace of
Chriltianburgh was reduced to the b; r;
walls, in the course of fix hours. Both
th; wings were also 011 fire, and the north
one reduced ; but, by the great exertions
of the burghers, the south wing, although
burnt down, was prevented from commu
nicating to the Chancery and Museum
Had the fire caught either the one or tl e
pther, jt would have beeH impoflible to
have saved the bank or magazines.
The houses on the Strand were also
much endangered, as the wind blew di
rectly upon them ; and large pieces of
burning wood were flying about in the
streets. The conflagration mult have been
seen all over the island, I suppose, such a
fccne was never beheld in the world ; âfo
great a pile of building dellroyed in so
(hort a space of time. It rs said, that ma
ny of the people.have been burnt, but as
yet there are no particular accofunts of the
number. Very little of the furniture or
effects were saved. The King's private
library was destroyed, as were moll of the
papers and books in the high court. The
damages will amount to many millions.
* ' V
The royal family are universally pitied,
and much praise is due to the prince royal,
who was all the night walking about, with
out any attendants, to prevent disorders
âThis (hewed his confidence in the peo
ple.
FRA.NKFORT, Feb. *8.
The names of the French commiflaries,
which arrived here on the 15th inft. are O
chet,Paris and Fitterman ; they were escort
ed by a body of Prussian hufiars, and rode in
a ccfach, on each corner of which was a red
cap, and before the tri-colour flag.
Just before they got to the White Swan
Inn, at which they alighted, a foreigner tore
down the latter, but he was immediately seiz
ed, and ca-iried to the Guard House. The
populace appeared in tumultous' numbers,
but the guards prevented their insulting the
Comm flaries, and a Prufiian Sentinel does
duty at the door of the White Swan Inn,
whilst they remain here.

NATIONAL CONVENTION.
Fepruary 15.
Barrere communicated the following arti-
cles relative to the armies
ROYALISTS DEFEATED.
General Duquefnoy thus writes from
Pont de Noyers, the 2 2d, of Pluviofe
(ioth February.)
* " At last 1 have met the famous army
of Charette, a quarter of a league from
Pont de Noyers 011 the great road to Nantes.
My light troops on the left, engaged in a
briik fire with their advanced guard. At
two o'clock in the afternoon, I repaired
to the field of battle ; as fact as my 'batta
liogs arrived, 1 drew them up, and the
fire was very hot on both fides. In the
onset these vagabonds not only refilled,
but advanced upon usâwhen seven of my
battalions were ranged, the charge was
beat. The enemy, on their fide, produ
ced three new battalions that had been
concealed in a wood. The combat lasted
an hour, and was very hot. Our' troops
at length - repulsed the Rebels, in every
part, the gveateft part of whom threw a
way their arms and fled into the wood ;
about eight hundred bit the dust. I
have, in the -whole, almolt one hundred
.men killed and wounded. My Aid-de
camp L'Anglojs had his horse killed un
der him. We know not whither the Re
bels are fled."
Gen. Tureau writes from Saumur, the
2Jth, and confirms this news. He adds,
" we arefeid to have been beaten at Cho
let, whereas we have gained-there a com
plete victory. 1 was at Angers the 33d,
and they said here yelterday, that Pont
de Ce was taken 011 the 23d, &c. Gen.
Cordelier, who has beaten the enemy at
Cholet, has orders to pursue them with
out intermission.
" He tells rae, that Laroche Jaquelin
is killed, and buried at Trementrin.
Thirtyreports have been made of that
event, and they all agree. It is however,
certain, that he was not present at the

General Pichegru writes from head
quarters at; Reunion fur Oife, that he has
visited many of the cantonments, and
finds the foldieiy in the highest lpirits.
He fends a letter of Brigadier-Geueral
Moreau, dated from CafTel, which an
nounces, that on the 13th (Feb. 1) 700
men who set out from Ypres, attacked the
poll of Botfjhequefie, defended by no more
than 350 of our Chafleiirs. The enemy
entered the village ; our troops retreated
into the Church, from the tower of r.hich
they kept up such a fire on the Slaves,
that they were obliged to retiie, leaving
thirteen killed in the burial place, befidc*
eight found afterwards near the road to
Veftrade, âwe took also nine prifojiers
and twenty one fufils.
ATTEMPT of the ENGLISH on''
CORSICA. v
LacombeSt. Michel, Representative of
the people, at Batia, in Corsica, writes,
uuder date of the 2d Pluviofe, that an
English squadron menacfd these coalts.
On the preceeding evening three large vcf
fels approached Nouza, in the Gulph of
St. Florefit, and attempted to land tome
troops to burn the mills ; but.some (loops
with grenadiers, and an armed felucca put
off, and the English retired.
The frigate Melpomene, being becalm
ed, was attacked by two English frigates,
two leagues from Calvi. The English, as- -
ter three hours fight, left the French (hip.
It appears that the principal delign cf
the English at this moment, is to take
from us those towns in Corsica that re
main faithful to the Convention, but
chance has not favored their efforts.â

PHILADELPHIA,
APRIL 30.
The New York papers of yesterday in
form that Mr. Jay will fail from that port in
a few days for London.
From Correspondents.
The jargon of our anarchists isworthey
of being remembered, in order to mark
its contradictions. Sometimes an excise,
or frigates, or regiments, mu!l not be a -
greed to, because our government is found
ed on the confidence of the people. At
other times a measure is cppofed, because
a republican Confutation iubfifts by the
yalpufy of the people. Thus our Repub
lic relts on two foundations, jeafoufy and
ocnfidenceâthe proverb fays Tomethiog a
bout two llools.
The manner of supporting and admi
ntflenng government is not unlike this
theory. They would have us believe no
body is so jealous of its fafety : Yet a so
reign agent acting here in a mariner to
outrage and subvert it, has all their sup
port. That foreign agent (said they)
mull be refpeited, feaited, and carelfed,
liecaufe he was the representative of the
Republic. The firft magiilrate of this
country was treated with unexempled out
rage, for pursuing a system of wife neu
trality. Yet these are the men. who pre
tend to be eyes and mouths for the people,
and who dread above all things, foreign
influence. Lately the fame faction has
opposed preparation for war and negotia
tion to prevent it. They were moving
heaven and earth againit an envoy being
sent, against frigates being eqiuped, taxes
levied, and troops : Yet they afteit to be
the champions for our trade, which they
nurse and pamper by knocking it on the
head with a prohibition. Then very sen
sibly and confidently they go to work to
pile up tax upon tax on trade. The his
tory of our faction would amuse and unde
ceive the people.
The (hamelefs profligacy of some who
call themselves Republiear.s ; their total
want of principle, public and private,
would form a whimlieal and (hocking con
trait with the puritanism of their political
cant. We have several Catalinesâif we
had as many Sallufts to writeÂ»their lives,
the good citizens would have no more to
fear from their intrigues.
Mr. Goodhue this day, in the House of
Reprsferitatives of the United States laid on
the table, the following resolution ; previous
to which he observed, {hat as the session was
drawing towards a close, it behoved Congress
to take' the fubjeft of the spoliations made
on our commerce into consideration, and
quiet the mercantile interest of this country
by aflurauces, that indemnification should be
made for the immense lofles they had sustain
ed by British spoliation, to which upon every
principle of justice as well <Â»s pol'cy, they
were intitled ; he had fpecified no fund from
which the indemnification should be made,
as he conceived we should be better prepared
to do-that when the result of the intended
negociation. was knoynj than we were at
present.
Whereas, it is a primary object in the es
tablishment of civil government, to pro
tect tlie persons and property of its ci
. tizens from the violence of nations as
wÂ«ll as individuals : And whereas ma- ;
nj ot* the citizens of the United States
have fuffcrecl great lofles, by spoliation
made on their commerce under the au
. thority of Great Britain, in violation
of the law nations ancl the rights of
neutrality.
Resolved, by the Senate and House of
Riprefentativcs of the United States of A
mcrica in Ctngrefs nffembled, That the U
nited States will guarantee an indemnifi
cation to all such Citizens of the United
States, whose property may have been
captured and confiscated under the autho
rity of Great Britain, in violation of the
law of nations and the rights of neutral
ity.

THE Belvidere left Plymouth on the
Btii of March, and brought London pa
pers up to the 4th. Previous to her leav
ing Plymouth, accounts were received
from Ireland, that about 2000 men had
afUmbled 111 arms; the troops were sent
to suppress them ; one of the principal
ringleaders was taken ; it was the general
opinion, it would be of but short durati
on. The greatest exertions were making,
by all the different powers, for a vigorous
campaign, which was thought woulti be:i
very early and bloody one. Lord
Ravvdon, with a body of British a.:J
Heflian troops, was at the isle of Wight,
and its vicinity. Transports had Liled
from Oftend, to bring i*er an additional
number of foreign troops, to compleat
the army" under his command, 'to about
iz,ooo men, who, it was said, were to
make a delcent on the cojlt of France.
FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE.
LONDON, March 4.
Letter from his Serene Highness the
Duke of Brnnfwick, to the Prince
Royal of Pruilia.
Mentz, Jan. 24.
" The concern which your Royal High
ness has been pieafed to teftify on account
of my retreat from the army, inspires
,me with thÂ« molt heartfelt 'gratitude
Nothing but a conjuncture of circumstan
ces as difaltrous as Uncommon, could have
prevailed on me to adopt a measure which
is so affecting for myfelf.
" I have been highly flattered by the
opportunities I have now and then found
to approach your Royal Highness and to
admire in you thofc talents which cannot
t'Ail to place you among the great men of
our age. Europe stands truly in need of
them, at a time, when near 400,000 com
bitants, and 80 line of battle (hips, sup
ported by an intestine war, > have in vain
endeavored to crulh that confederation of
crimes which is tyrannizing over France.
I am eminently happy to find that my
zeal in serving a good cause, has notefca
ped your Royal notice. Ve
ry unfortunately, indeed, the movements
of the army have been often paralized at
the very time when the greatest energy
and exertion were required.
" If, after the surrender of' Mentz;
,Houchard had been attacked, forced back,
and defeated, the reinforcements which
ftrcngthcned the army of the North would
not have reached it, and of course the
check near Maubeuge would have been
avoided.' Saar Louis, ill-provided with
provision, and dcflitute of all prote&ion
from bombs, would in all probability, have
been reduced within a fortnight. Alsace
might then have been turned by the Saar.
The pofleflion of Lauter would have af
forded more solid advantages; and if, by
all pollible means, the junction of the ar
mies of the Rhine and the Moselle had
been prevented, and the point of Bou
queron gained, Strafbourgh would have
been threatened, and Landau very likely
subdued.
" I beg your royal highnefs's pardon
for expreiling my regrets. Complaints
are useless, I know, but sometimes they
afford a momentary relief. Permit me on
ly to add, that if you have any influence
over iny successor, I would wish you to
prevail on him to employ all his credit to
prevent the frittering of the army into
too numerous detachments; the conse
quence of which is, that being every where
too weak to adl on an offenfive plan, our
troops are obliged to confine themselves to
defenfive measures with the enemy we have
to combat, which is a fault produdlive of
the most pernicious consequences. 1 .
" It is with the fincerelt regret I leave
an army which has inspired me with the
highest esteem, admiration, and attach
ment."

ifoufe of Reprejeuiatfuis Aprtl 25.
Monday, April 28.
Mr. Gillon, a new member from South-
Carolina, was qualified and took his ftat.
The Clerk proceeded in the reading the
evidence in' the contested election between
Mr. Francis Preston one of the fitting mem
bers from Virginia, and Mr. Trigge.
When the Clerk had finifhea the reading,
Mr. Prellon rose to enter upon a reply. He
observed that the difcufiion of this -queltion
had been so long defeired very much against
his wilhes. But as it now was two o'clock
in the afternoon, and as it would require
more than an hour for him to go through
his remarks, he ftiould, if agreeable to the
house, defer beginning thein till to-morrow.
At the fame time, if it was more agreeable
to gentlemen, he ihould eruer upon the fub
jeÂ£t now.
Ater a few words from Mr. W. Smith,
and Mr. Trigge, it was determined to defer
the business till to-morrow.
The house then went into a committee on
â  the report refpefling the better regulation of
the courts of justice ia some of the southern
ftatea. â  ' â 
Mr. S. Smith (Maryland) stated the in
convcniencies that arose trom the present ar
i angement of the courts in the state for which
he was a repreientative. It was at one period
of a cause requilite to travel to the eallera\
iliore of the Chefapeak, and hire an attorney
for going to that difiance. In another stage
of the question, the whole business was trans
ferred to an opposite fide of rhe bay. This
was in the trial of criminal cases, attended
with many inconveniancies. The member
mentioned an instance of a captain of a veflel
who had been apprehended for smuggling ;
but while they were conducting him across
the bay to his trial, he seized a proper oppor
tunity, jumped out of the boat, swam alhoVe,
away he went, and was never heard of.
Mr. Macon, Mr. W. Smith, Mr. Nicho
las, Mr. Fitzfimons, and ftveral other mem
bers, spoke to the question. Numerous in
cohveniencies were stated, as ar'.fing from
the present arrangement of courts of law.
One particular circumstance may serve as a
specimen. In some places of the southern.
ftafe, a person may, for a cause of twenty
dollars, be put to the trouble and expence of
travelling backwards and forwards, to the
extent altogether of nine hundred miles, bo
fore he can be fare of obtaining a deciiion.
It was admitted that considerable grievances
of this kind exist.d, but to point out an ef
fectual remedy seemed very difficult.
Mr. Fitzfimons was of opinion that the
house (hould endeavour to expedite this af
fair if possible, as they had many other fub
jecfts on hand, and if they did not quicken
their progress, he forefaw that, at the end of
the session, a great part of the public busi
ness would remain undone ; he therefore re
commended dispatch.
At three o'clock the committee rofc, the
chairman reported progress, and the house
adjourned.
April 29.
This day the House proceeded in the
coniideration of the contested election of
Mr. PiellonâThat gentleman addrefTed

were made by several membersâand on
the question to agree to the report of the

Tile Public are cautioned to
beware of counterfeited Fine Dollar Bills of
the Bank of the United States, and Twenty
Dollar Bills of tlx Bank of North America>
fe-veral of which ba-ve appeared in circulation
<witbin a few di.ys pajl; they are a good ge
neral imitation of the genuine Bills, but may
be diflinguijhed by the following '
MARKS.
Five Dollar Bills of the Bank of ihe
United States.
ALL that have appeared have the letter F.
for their Alphabetical Mark.
The Texture of tlie Paper is thi/cker and
whiter and it takes the ink more freely than
the genuine paper.
Tiie O. in the word Company is smaller
than the MÂ« and other letters of that word,
so that a line extended from the top of Â«Se <
to touch the top of the M would extend <> *-
fiderably above the range of the whole word-
In the word the letters are narrow
erand closer together than the reft of the bill
The i and fin the word promise are not
parallel, the pipelining much more forward
than the r.
Blw&siw
The engraving is badly cxecured,the (bokes
of alJthe Letters are stronger and the devi t
in themargin particularly is much coar (fraud
appears darker than in the true bills. Some
el the counterfeits bear date in T791 âWhere-
as the Bank was not in operation tijl Decern
bcr, and no five dollar bills were jiTued in
jhat year.
Twenty Dollar Bills of the Bank of North
ALL that have appeared have the letter
B. for their alphabetical mark.
.They are printed on a paper nearly similar
to that of" tl.e counterfeit Five Dojlai Notes
above defer ibed ; the en raving is pcitc; exeÂ»
ucted, and they approach rearer to the ap
pearance of the genuine bills.
The fine ruled lines through the word Twen
ty, in the body of the bill, are in number rh.r
teen in the genuine b lis, and but tw< Â»ve in
the counterfeits.
Til e word Company is much l;k*.* the fame
word in the Five Dollar B'Ms as defer ibed a
bove, the beiug less than the m, and ctheÂ»s
iolhr* ing.
There is no flroke to the t in the word Karfh
whereas in the genuine bilis the stroke is well
defined.
The letters cnt in the word Twenlx, to the
left hand at the bottom, do not come down to
toe line, l>ut are so cut as to give an irregular
appearance to the word, the Tw and he_y go
ing belo*v tljem.
The signature J Nixon, has the appear
ance of being written with lamb-black, and
oil, and differs from oiher inks ofed !n
printing the bills and tlie caihier's (ignature.
It is luppoCed the fe forgeries were contmiued
in some of the Southern States, as ail the coun
terfeits thai have appeared, have come from
thence, and two persons have been appiehend
ed in Virginia,on suspicion of being the author
of* them.
The reward o[ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS
wilj be paid toanv Pbrfon or Persons who shall
discover and prosecute to convi&ion the feveial
offenders of the following descriptions or any
ot iheni, viz.
The person or prrfons, who mamifa&t>*ed

Philadelphia, March 28 1794
7 22 > 1794.
Other counterfeit bills
of the Bank of the UniiedStates have appeared
in circulation.
The denomination is of TWENTY DOL
LARS, and the alphabetical mark is the let
ter B.
"They msy be diftinguiftied from the genu
ine by the following MARKS :
The paper of the counterfeits is of a more
tend r texture and gloffey fur face than the
genuine, and there is no water mark in them.
The letter C. in the word Ofhier, in the
true bills is marked, whereas in the
counterfeits, the whole letter is a fine hair
stroke, evidently in an unfinifhed state. The
letter d in the wed demand, is badly formed
and the who.'e word if! done, and there is-no
comma at the end of it, as there is in the
genuine bills.
m&rth6w
i he marginal device, is much darker in
the falfe, than in the genuine bills owing to
the fiiade strokes being coarser, much nearer
together, and consequently much more nu
merous. This ditference ftrikesthe eye at firft
view,
The fame reward of ONE THOUSANb
DOLLARS, will be paid for
prosecuting to conyiftion the several abooe
described Offenders in lefpeft to tbis, as to
