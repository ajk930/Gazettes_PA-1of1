THE grand principle of Equality, if right

the outrages of oppression ; confirms, 'n the

FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE.
LONDON, Feb. 21.
The fleet aflembled at Spithead, under
Lord Howe, amounted to upwards of 106
fail. Sixty of which, were fliips of the
line. Some French frigates had been crui
sing in the Channel, and taken a number
of vefiels. Nine French Eaft-Indiman,
under convoy of two frigates, were arrived
at L' Orient.
By the last accounts from Paris, we learfii,
tjiat the Convention has decreed, " that fta
very lhall be abolilhed in all the French ifÂ«
lands." This, they fay, will be a death blow
to Pitt.
On the 4th inft. the National Convention
decreed, that the colony of St. Domingo
foould be represented in the aflembly. On
that day three deputies came to take their
feats, viz. a negro, a mulatto, and a white.
They were greatly applauded and received
the fraternal embrace of Vadier the President.
This scene was accompanied by the reitera
ted cries vise l'egalite ! The negroes of St.
Domingo have sworn to extirpate the Eng
lish from that Island. On the Bth several %
people of colour acknowledged their grati
tude to the Convention for having given li
berty to their brethren.
March 4.
In the opinion of a certain learned
writer, the present French government is
likely to end in a military Republic, of v
which Paris is to be the center, with the
other departments of the kingdom as its
circumference, and under its controuLâ
In that cafe, adds he, let Europe trem
ble; depopulation and diminution of in
ternal resource will then rather stimulate
than impede conquest, as they did in an

during the most rapid d.cline of the po
pulation and of the resources of Italy. *

HOUSE OF LORDS.
February 14.
Lord Moira's Expedition.
The Earl of Moira, rose to take no
tice of some observations that had been
thrown out by an honorable gentleman,
Major Maitland, in another house, on the
expedition which he had the honor to com
mand. His Lordship explained at some
length, the general outlines of the expedi
tion, the views of his Majesty's Ministers,
and the communications which had taken
place with the Royalists 011 the fut>je<s.
He had been sent for, he said by his MaÂ»
Alley's Ministers, on the 17th of Ofto-
Eejj, and informed by them, of the fuc
#ith which it was intended the Roy
alists should be furniihed. He did not he
sitate to undertake the expedition propos
ed, nor that responsibility which he consi
dered as attached to it. The Royalists
had demanded a certain force, to co-ope
rate with therti, and his Majesty's Minis
ters had appointed a much greater force
than they had requested ; It only remain
ed that a junction (hould be fiied : and
before that could be effe&ed, some fignah
were agreed upon, and some frigates sens
to repeat those signal?; but they were
not av>fwered by the Royalists. On the
10th of November, some persons were
sent to concert measures with them, and*
different spot for landing Was fixed upon.
âThe Royalists had required artillery
men, as they had scarce any one who
under flood the use of cannon. I lifLwJr
/hip had represented to his Majesty's MioÂ»I ers, who had entrusted him with a dif
retionary powjr on this expedition, the
necessity of bringing (pme persons from
rlandert, who were acquainted with the
management of artillery; and as he hop
ped to have formed an immediate junction
with the Royalitls, he had appointed
two French officers, of great merit, his
aids-cl u camp, and another as hiss fecietary;
because he conceived, the junction once
made," Ins little army was not to be grafted
into that of the Royalifis, but was to
form a part of that which he had the
honor to command. In these circumstan
ces, he thought himfelf juftilicd in making
the appointments on which such animad
versions had been made.
He concluded by faying, that he took
the whole responsibility upon himfelf, be
cause his Majeily's Ministers had fully
approved of the appointment he had re
commended to them.
Lord Lauderdale rose to juftify the
notice that had been taken in the House of
Commons of these Had
minilters been as candid and explicit as
the Noble Lord, it would have been deemed
fatiffadtory ; but they had observed a fulien
silence, and had not even deigned to give
the least explanation on the fubjeft.
Lord Greenville wished all responsibility
for the measures adopted by Earl Moir'a
to attach an adminiiti ation, who, he con
tended, had acted legally and conlHtution
ally.

] " TALBOT, President."
Mr. DEXTER's OhJervaticiiS concluded.
r I refpeft the manly republicanism of
America too much, tj believe that the
' popular water-gruel, the milk for suck
lings, with which some men llrive to gain :
his favor, can either pleale his appetite or
invigorate his fyttem. There are discon
tented men in all countries; perhaps our
own has fewer than any other. They
hollow loud and often, and we are there- '
fore led to think they are numerous. A '
tumultuous minority thus imposes i
measures on a peaceful majority, against
the firft principle of Republicanism. 0 The
voice of the people is not for war, un
less necessary for our fafcty ar.d -honor.
Many in this City may wi(h for it ; but
the majority through the Union are desi
rous of peace. I ho* they wiil encoun
ter war bravely, if it (hall overtake them,
they aie against running to meet it.
I will not detain the committee with
flati.ng the inconveniences we fubjeft our
selves to, the difficulty of obtainihg lup
plies trorri other countries during the coh
vulfions of Europe, the loss of our arti
cles of export, periling on our hands
from a retaliatory prohibition by Britain,
the impossibility of executing such a law,
or the encouraging_cif frauds to tic rain
of tfij merchant of honor. Theie have
already been the fubje&s of observation.
The llrong objection which arises from
our constitution, 1 cunnot omit. In the
diltribution of power to the several de
partments of government, the right of
| making treaties is given to the Execu
tive. Of course the preparatory negocia
tion mud belong to them as ail incident
of the authority. But we are now com
mencing a negocintion ourl'eh es, and pre
ferring terms of a treaty. It is urged
that this cannot bind the Executive
They may make a different treaty, but
our prohibition will still be in force. Do
we intend to fay then, that we will forbid
our Citizens from Commerce with Bri
tain even after the Executive, the only
iconftitutiona! power, (hall have fettled ail
â¢matters of difference, unless they will f u f.
I fer us to dictate the mode in which they
fliall ezercife their authority ? This looks
to me very much like usurpation, by
whatever name we may chufe to call it.
It has been said, by a zealous friend of
the measure, that a treaty would be the
supreme law of the land, by virtue of the
conilitution, and therefore would repeal
this law. Perhaps it may in future be
thought convenient to retradt that doc
| trine. If it be true, it is idle to make
â  the But fir, I doubt the truth of
P it. It appears strange to fay that an ad
in its nature such we are
told this is, can be abrogated by an &e
---eutive att. I know of nothing but the
legislature which can repeal a law. It
belongs either to legislative or execwive
power. If the former, the legislative on
ly, can abrogate it ; if the latter, we
ought not to meddle with it. We may
as well carry thro' the negociation, as be
gin it, and prescribe the terms of it. If the
constitution had given us this power, wc
could not exercise it, from our numbers
and mode of doing bnfinefs. It will not
be denied, that the Executive have a right
to appoint and iullruft a negociator, as to
the terms of settlement. Have we the
lame rightâor even can we inftruft him
when they {hall appoint? Suppose hnii
thus doubly inftrocted by the Executive
having conftitutior.al authority, and by
us who cannot tell from whence we de-
â  rive the power, and the inftruftions con
each.othor; whom i$ the Negociar
tor to obey ? None will fay thst theÂ°pow
er of the Executive is not paramount all
others as to treaties, and all foreign ne
gotiations. Are we to make a law then
which may be violated with impunity ;
nay more with propriety ? I wish fir, that
, gentlemen who so often tremble for the
â¢ lan&uary of Republicanism and depiecate
usurpation of power, would apply these
t excellent feci mgr. to this fubjetf. We
1 have been often told that something mult
> be done, and that if we object to this
measure we ought to (how a better as a
fubilitute. I have never thought this a
difficult task; I will now state the outlines
i w hat ought to be dpne. By a peculiari
ty in our constitution negociation with fo
reign nations is altogether anExecutive du
ty ; but to declare war, is with the Legis
lature. In governments where the pow
ers of negociation and of war are in the
fame hands, the fame officer can demand
a recompence for an injury, propose hit i
Ultimatum, and declare war if it be re- i
jv.Cted ; but our Executive may be em
barrafied in pursuing a demand of cum- '
penfatiop to the last extremity, left he
ihould pledge the honor of the nation to
war against the will of the legislature, who
ajone can make war. We ought there
fore to pais a resolution requesting the !
Pt etident to pursue with energy a demand |
for recompence according to the cuiiom j
o. nations, and pledging ourselves to sup- j
port ilira if the event ihould prove unfuc- !
cess. ul; and in the mean time we ought to
prepare for war. I c an f ee nothing fur.
tner whicn is legislative in its nature, or
committed to our care by the constitution;
uptii it (hall appear that the negociation
Has failed of success. Then fir, it will
be time enough to prohibit commercial
intercourse, or declare war, or take any
other measures to avenge our wrongs and
vindicate the honor of our country. If
we are to engage in war fir, 1 presume wc
mult have forr.e money to carry it on, un
lets in this instance also we are an excep
tion from general rules. The measure
now contemplated mull almost annihilate
our imports and we have not looked round
for a iubftifute. We have heard of a
innd tax," but there are many objections
to it. On the eve of war public credit
is doubly important. Having loft our
former refuurccs, wp must provide new
funds for the par,dual payment of the in
terest of the public d .t, the expenses
Â° B over Dmeni, and the innumerable ex
penses of war. Wt must not only fuffer hea- ,
vy taxes and burthens, but also an enor
mous increase of our debt. As lam not
guJiy of being a creditor of the union,
pei haps I may be heard patiently on this
iubject. It has been often said here, that
tiie public debt has enllaved our country,
_ yet row we a e urged to enereale it b'c
-1 â  yÂ° nd a " calculation, without taking the
u.ual mealures for pacific accommodation,
t I l.ougii I have labored in vain to un
) derlland how the public debt is an engine
of fluvery, and have fmcerely thought our
- country a perfect model of civil freedom,
yet I hope this argument will have some
weight with those, who fee that we are
Â£aves and that the public debt has riveted
our fetters. Here give me leave to answer
an argument, which has been repeatedlv
prefTed, and with apparent success. It is
not denied that the firllj regular step is to
.demand a recompence for art injury; but
it is laid that Britain regards no laws of
nations in her conduct to ns, and there
fore we are not bound to observe them to
wards her. I presume by this is not meant
that we ought to do wrong, because Bri
tain has done wrong ; butthat it becomes
rig.it for us to disregard those laws.which
(he violates; let us examine this. The
b.wsand usages have prescribed
redress of a I
nation ror an injury ; these of necessity can
only be applicable to an injured nation,
for no other can n<?ed redress. Can it then
fci. true that the moment a nation is injur
ed, and thereby is placed in the situation
tor which, and for which alone the rule
was made, the rule ceases to be obligatory ?
A Ration cannot be injured, p.nlefs the
law 3 of nations with refpeft to her have
neen violated. According to this argu
ment a veiy solemn rule of condud has
been ellablifhed which is never to be com
plied with ; not by a nation which has
received an injury, because there is
nothing to redress; and not by a nation
which has been injured, because with res."
pest to her the laws of nations have been
h Y the aggressing nation, and
tins dispenses with the rule. Thisannve â¢
1 I
>- to an argument ftÂ» muoii relied on is to
i- my mind perfectly fatisfaftory. 1 call tn
the gentlemen to {hew it to be a fallacy.'-
!l Our situation fir is not new, though .our
conduct may be so. We have seen "fiol
i land when neutral in former wars, fuifer
; ing similar injuries ; they did not purine
t fuel; measures as we contemplate, though
: better prepared for war: Neither their
: interest or their honor luffercd by their
moderation. The present neutral powers
of Europe are fellow-fufterers with us ; yes
- we do not hear of liaiilar impetuosity of
> resentment. In all wars neutral nations
i arc abused, in proportion as the powers at
i war are llrong, and the neutrality weak.-
â  A stronger combination than the present
perhaps never cxitted in Europe ; and a
neutrality can seldom be weaker. The
principles of the present war arc also pe
culiar ; it is a desperate llruggle for exig
ence. The unusual circumstances of it
have compelled the French with whom we
j are in friendfhip, not only to difregardour
| rights as a neutral nation, but to violate
; their treaty with us, though we have pro
, ceeded so far in friendfhip to them as to
hazard our peace. Our meichants iuSer
! severely from that nation ; yet we are told
j that imperious necefiity from peculiar eir
â  cumftances is an excuic. I fay not thtie
| things to criminate that nation ; they have
! been civil enough to apologize and pie
mile recompence; but we have not receiv
ed even gocd manners.from their enemies.
The public mind appears to have fufiercd
little irritation fiom.this cause, and it is far
from my wish to excite any. My motive
is only to (hew that this acquiescence in"
their apology proves our opinion, that tks
present war is peculiar in its nature. Hi.}'
we owe nothing but indignation to Bri
tain, yet we oweprudencc to our country
and refpeft to ourselves. The prefect
moment is infinitely valuable, and outfit
not to be trifled with. The present til .1 â¢
tion and difpofitiou of Britain aiifcoft en
sure us honorable peace, unless we ; ro
voke war. We have ftroiig evidence that
war with this country is against both their
interest and their wishes. Though tf>e
meaftire under consideration is not in ttftif
hoflility, and violates no law of" nations,
were we to flop here ;yeta little reflexi
on mult convince us that it tends to war.
It is placing our negotiation for reecra.
| pence from Brit-iin oti fonew, and A
them so humiliating a footing, that the r
pride mull revolt ; thus national heftur
must forbid a compliance. They will fey
to our negotiator, no nation ever address
ed another in this wayâSuppoie we have
injured you; it is not pofiible for us to
treat with you refpeding retribution on
, these terms : It is not an offct of peaceful
accommodation, but an affront, a chal
lenge. This refufal to treat, which the
mode of making the demand renders tei
tam, will then be urged as a refufal ira
make us a recompence ; and uar beccm.-s
inevitable.

Citizen^
Your Gazette has been compared to that of
Brujfcls, and you have endeavored to ex
culpate it from the charge, by ironically)
as I suppose you call it)fupporting the
comparifoii. But you Ihould recoiled*,
Citizen, that when things are compared,
we do not always include in the companion
all the pÂ£s, qualities, &c. The Brujfcls
Gazette for inftancc, is allowed to be, in
many refpefts, a very ufeful paper: it is
conduced with modesty, inculcates a due
refpeft to the conflituted authorities, obetli
ence to the laws, a detejlation of anarchy ; &
in this refpeiSt lam ready.to confefs that
the comparison does not hold good. The
Brussels Gazette is so noted for its incorreS
nefs on recent occurrences,thatFcote,to paint
a liar in the strongest light, fays that " he
lies like the Brujfcls Gazette. " Every
one knows that this expreflion of the co
median is become proverbial ; and if there
is any, who is not convinced that it has
been justly applied to the General Jld-wr
tfer, let him read your Bulletin volant,
published on the 18th 6f this month.
You fay, " The Brijfels Gazette treats
the people as a Stuinifii multitude ; and so â 
does the General AduertiferWhat you
iheant here as irony "forfooth" is literally
true. Is not the abovementioned Bulletin
a fufficient proof of this! Would any
one, who did not look on the public as
swinishly ignorant, have publiftied, and
republifhed, that romantic (lory, with
pretended confirmations of its truth, long
after the city was in pofTeflion of proof of
its rcfemblance to the Br jpls Gazette ?
The other Printers of the City, behaved
with much more refpeft to the people j it
is true, tbry published the contents of
this Bulletin volant, but they at the fame
time took effectual care to prevent its be
ing believed by telling us
from whence they had extracted it. Thus
then a comparison between theie two fa
mous Gazettes was not inapplicable, even
according to your own words; and why
then be offended at it ?

Charlotte, a tale of Truth,
IN TWO VOLUMES.
By Mrs. ROWSON, of the New Theatre,
Philadelphia, Author of Vittoria, the In
quisitor, the F-iJle de Chambre, &c.
Of Charlotte, the Reviewers have given
the following charatier.
IT may be a Tale of Truth, for it is ot
and it is a tale of real diltrefs.â
Charlotte, by the artifice of a teachei, recom
mended to a school, from hnmanify rather
tl\an a convi&ion of her integrity, of the re
gularity of her former conduct, is enticed
from her governed, and accorppanies a young
officer to America.âThe marriage ceremo
ny, if not forgotten, is postpOned, and Char
lotte dies a martyr to the inconstanCy of her
qver, and treachery ot his friend.âThe fix
ations are artless and affedingâthe descrip
tion-, natural and pathetic; we should feel
for Charlotte if such a peifon ever existed,
who for* one er : or scarcely, perhlps, deserved
so severe a puniftiment. If it is a fi&jon,
poetic ju (lice is not, we think, properly dis
tributed

The Public are cautioned to
beware of counterfeited Five Dollar Bills of
the Hank of tlx United Suites, and Twenty
Dollar Bills of the B/tnt of North America,
fever a! of which have appeared in circulation
within a few days pi'.Jl; they are a good ge
neral imitation of the genuine Bills, but may
be diftingu jhed by the following
M A R*K S.
Ti*ve Dollar Bills of the Bank*of the
United Statej.
ALL that have appeared have the letter F.
for their Alphabetical Mark.
The Tdxturc of the Paper is thickcr and
whiter and it takes the ink more freely than
the genuine paper.
The O. in the word Company is fmallet
than the M. and other letters of that word,
so that a line extended from the top of the O,
to touch the top of the M would extend con
siderably above'the range of the whole word.
In the word United the letters are narrow
erand clojer togechei than the reft of the bill
The i and yin the word proinife are not
parallel, the f inclining much more loiward
than the i. Â» '
. The engraving is badly executed,the fti okes
of all the Letters are stronger the devi e
in themargin particularly is much co tiler and
appears darker than in the true bills. Some
Wthe counterfeits bear daie in 179 1 â* Where
as tft# Bank was not in operation till Detem
ber, and no five dollar bills were issued in
jhar. year.
Twenty Dollar Bills of the Bank of North
America.
ALL have appeared have the. letter
B. lor their alphabetical mark.
They are printed on a nearly similar
t'd that of the couuterfeit Five Dollar Notes
above defci 'bed ; the epgraying is b< tteÂ« exe
ucted, and they approach nearer to the ap
pearance of the genuine bills.
The fine ruled lines through the word Twen
ty, in the body of the bill, are 'n number th 1-
teen in the genuine bills, and but twelve in
the counterfeit*.
The word Company is much like the fame
word in the Five Dollar Bills as defer ibed a
bove, the 0 being less than them, and others
following.
There is no stroke to the /in the wot North
whereas in the genuine bills the stroke is well
defined.
The letters ent in the word TwentVy to the
left hand at the bottom, do not come down to
the line, but are so cut as to give an irregulai
appearance to the word, the Tw and 'hty go
ing below them.
The fignamre 1 Nixon, has the appear
ance of being written with lamb-black and
01, and differs from other inks used in
printing the bills and the calhier's signature.
It is supposed tl\efe forgeries were committed
in forheof th-- Southern States, an all the coun
terfeits thai have appeared, come from
tbcncc, and two per Tons have been apprehrrifl
ed in Virginia, on suspicion of being the author
of them.
The reward of ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS
win be paid to any Person 01 Ptifons who fhali
discover and prosecute to convi&ton the several
offenders of the following defciiptions or any
of them, viz.
The person or persons, who manufactured
the paper on which the Bills arc printed.
The perfou or persons, who engraved the
plates.
The printer or printers, of the bills.
Every person who has a&ed as a principal in
any other way, 111 the counterfeiting and utter
ing the said bills.
Philadelphia, March 28, 1794
April 22, 1794,
Other counterfeit bills
of the Bauk of the United States have appeared
in circulation.
The denomination is of TWENTY DOL
LARS,and the alphabetical mark is the let
ter B.
They may be diftinguiihed from the genu
ine by the following MAPiKS :
The paper'of the counterfeits is of a more
tend r texture and glofTey furface than the
genuine, and there is 110 water mark in them.
The letter C. in the word Calhier, in the
true bills is strongly marked, whereas in the
counterfeits, the whole letter is a fine hair
ttroke, evidently in an unfiniflied state. The
letter a in the word demand, is badly formed
and the whole word ill done, and there is no
comma at the end of it, as there is in the
genuine bills.
The marginal device, is much darker in
the falfe, than in the genuine bills owing to
the shade Ifrokes being coarser, much nearer
together, and consequently much more nu
merous. This difference strikes the eye at firft
view.
The fame reward of ONE THOUSAND
DOLLARS, will be paid for apprehending, &
prosecuting to convi&ion the several above
described Offenders in refpeft to this, as to
the last described bills.
