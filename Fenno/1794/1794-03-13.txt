For the Gazette of the United States.
The conduct of the powers at war is such
that an American cannot but feel for the ho
nor and fafety of his country. The report of
the Secretary of State, as well as other note,
rious proof, (hews that we fuffer wronpand
encroachment both from the French and the
Englifli. The feifure and Condemnation of
our vessels in the Weft Indies by the inglifli,
is yet but imperfectly explained to,us, but e
nough is known to convince us that the afpeft
of things is very alarming to our peace. To
loft our (hips and cargoes or to go to war to
R T I S E R.
[Whole No. 556.)
p rote <51 them, is a dreadful alternative. Peace
ought to be the aim of our politics as long as
it can be maintained. Two things are .now
properâTo lay alkie party disputes, and to in
dulge no intemperate passions. Parties now
owe it to their country to (hew their zeal for
the common welf are. Something must be done
but is it doing any thing worthy of* the Crilis,
worthy ot the firm aud confiderata chai after of
our nation, worthy of the neutral station we
have publicly taken, to celebrate French tri
umphs. Is peace our ol jest ? It"it really is*
let ns keep peaceâLet u behave like neutrals
and not like p3rtir sin the quarrel. If the dis
asters of the English arms ihould make them
less unjust, or left arrogant, than we think they
are, and if in consequence our chance for'pre
ferving peace should be the more favorable,
every patriot will rejoice in the event. The
f Ifure of our veffeU in the Weft Indies, on the
prerence ot rheir being forfeited by the laws
ot Louis 7 the if it has realty happeued, as
we have the molt alarming ground-: to fear it
has,is a fcttndalous breach of the L*ws of Jus
tice and of Neutrality, which merits our in
diguatiou. Even on that supposition, it is our
policy and our iutercft to iake our meafurel
coolly and cautiously. We must not take coun
fcl of our palfionvâlet ua (hew the impartial
world, that We have courted peace in the love
of peaceâthat they are the aggrefTÂ«>rs and
th t all men ought to wish to fee them hum
bled. What nuidnefs is it therefore, at this
critical moment, for the citizens of New York
to shew their paitizanfhip iji the war. Why
should they ring their bells ? What docs it fay
to the woi Id but that America is an enemy
under a niafk, prose/sing neutrality,yet shew
ing the most ardent paitiality. Is this a
proper time to give a pretext to the Eng
liih who feein to be ready enough even with
out one to violate our rights ? Is it our pru
dence to put into their mouths charges a
gainst our sincerity ? They will not fail to
fay, you are enemies who dare riot to de
clare war and yet fnppofe yourselves entitled
to indulge the passions of enemiesâyou allow
tin French to fell their priz<sin your ports.
âYou refufe the like privilege 10 usâyour
newspapers, your public meetings, your toasts
and even yÂ«ur tegiflative bodies, avow your
hatred of us. The ce lebrat ion of French tri
umphs, is done by public order, and at public
charge. This is not neutrality-âit is hostili
ty, and, therefore, we make reprifais. If
we would avoid war, let our prudence refufe
any act of merfling with its events or paflioiu.
Every individual may freely indulge his feel

[ .'ONTINUED.]
4t'jfy. T.i* prjpofcd rcfolutions would
favor an advantageous competition and
dntribution ot our trade, among the ma
nufactqri ng nations of Europe. At pre
f nt, it may he said to be monopolized by
one ; To great is tire di'proporlion of its
m inufadtures which come to our market.
I nat this is an evil, has been admitted,
*;id cinnot be doubted. It exposes us to
the greateit and molt sudden cmbarrafl*-
tnÂ« nts from thÂ£ capiiee, the paiTuns, the
mistaken calculations of mterelt, the bank
-1 nptc.es, and the wars of *a Jingle foreign
country. Miny of embarrafTmcnts
are felt at the present moment. If it were
poflible to liquidate them into a pecuniary
ltatement, it would be found that, in a
permanent view of our interest, there would
be economy in making very considerable
temporary facritices, for the purp9fe of
dividing our custom among a number of
competitors. It was not true, that Great
Britain alone can fupplvthe manufactures
we want. Fiance, the United Netherlands,
and fevcral other nat\>ns, are capable of
Supplying us with a variety of articles, as
well as the nation from which they now
come; and, if invited to our markets
V prudent encouragements in the firft
mlUuce, will soon lcain to faPnion their
manufactures to the wants ar,d tailes of
this country. The policy of favoring* par
ticular branches of ftracje, even at some ex
pence, in order to guard againlt the evil
of depending on a single one, was exemp
lified by the condu6t of Great Britain her
iv lt. A â¢though he viewed her difci.imina
tions generally, refpeaing, us, in .the light
he had explained ; yet, he thought it pof
fibie, that in the iiutance of naval stores
a-.vl it might be her intention
to fofler a ri/afeh:p ,n a dillant quar
ter, in order to provide against a casual
pi tvation of the lupplics of a nearer quar
ter. 1 nefe artieies are central to the ma
rine of Great Britain ; her marine is
eiTcntial to her greatuefs Were (he to
have no reiource but in the Baliic, a war
wfth the Baitfc powers might be fatal to
h r. .It may be wife in her, therefore, to
iteep ooen t.e American resource, even at
tle p?ice of a tax on hei fe:r. In this' cafe
(he mult' quarrel with both the Baltic
powers and the United States at the fame
time, be for? thefupplres will be cut off.
A member from Maflachufetts, (Mr.
D&ter) had not, Mr. M. said, been very
eo.uiltent in his i eafoning on this fubjedt.
rich id contended againit all attempts to
Excite .a beneficial competition, on the
idea tli t no competition could be benefi
ci 1 .vhich would not spring up of itfelf;
and yet he had warned us against the dan
ger, that Area's Britain, by exciting a
competition agair.ft the United States, in
tiiofe parts of Europe, which mod refera
ble the infant situation of our country,
might eftablilh new sources from which
supplies would afterwards fpontaiieciufly
flow tu her, without being Â«ver again
w anted from the United States. The fame
remaik was applicable to the leafoningof
the other gentlemen who had represented
the danger of exciting a permanent rival
(hip for the Weft-India market, in favour
of Canada and Nofk Scotia.
Fifthly. The plan of the resolutions
tended to conciliate nation! in treaty, or
disposed to be in treat)' with lis, into ar :
rangemen:B still more favourable to our
commerce-. This argument had peculiar
weight in relation to France. It had been
said that Great Britain was our belt cus
tomer. The faÂ£l, he said, was that we
were her bell cullomer: but that France
w;',6 our best customer. We consume more
of British manufactures than any other
nation in the world consumes. France
consumes more of oiir productions, than
any other nation confurr.e3. He referred
to the statement* he had before offered for
proof of this. Her consumption was also
of the most valuable kind ; and under fa
vourable regulations would be a very grow
ing one. It confiltcd of wheat and flour,
kit provisions, and firh; articles which
were not admitted by Great Britain ; and
which without the market of France,
would glut every other.
Of ourfilh (he consumed si ve eighths of
the whole exportation. Her use of our
live animals was another important cohfi
deration. It amounted, in the lilt of our
exports, to 352,795 dollars, for the year
1791. In the fame the Britilh de
mand amounted to no more than 62,4.15
dollars. The superior proportion of na
vigation we enjoyed in the French chan
nels of intercourfc had already been {hewn.
In examining the policy of cultivating
and securing the Fiench markets, he said
it ought not to be forgotten, that the pro
fits and the revenue ariling from the rum
diltilleries, depended on an article obtain
ed almoit, if not from thifc
French dominions alone ; and which was
the only raw material of any confequcnce
imported into the United States. It was
paid for also, as had been much urged on
otiiei occalionsby members on the oppo
site lide, in the worll fifli, which could
find a vent in no other part of the world.
The MolafTes imported into the United
Statcsin one year, amounted to upwards
oi leven millions of gallons, more than
one half of- which went into the state
of MalTachufetts. He took notice also
of the article of sugar, as rendered of
great importance by our habits and our
finances; and of which more than one
half was fuppliedby the French Weft-In
dies. Out of 17,142,723 dollars impor
-9,32 dollars were received
from that source. The residue came from
the Danifti, Dutch, and British domini
ons, in the following proportions, to
wit. Danish, 2,833,010 dollars, Dutch
*Â»7Â°7Â» 2 3 J dollars. Britilh 2,280,647
dollars. This ltatement was taken from
the imports of 1790, the only year he
had been able to examine on this point.
It had been said, why grant privileges
before a mutual grant should be secured
by positive stipulation ? Why throw away
by a legal regulation, wtoat ought to be
the price of treaty ? He answered, that
the legal regulation threw nothing away*
as i; was always recoverable : That in the
p: âfer.t iiiftance, it was only meeting the
legal regulations of which France had set
the example : that inltead of being a bar
to treaty, such a courie of proceeding,
more than any other, would smooth the
way to it, by explaining the objects, and
eftabli/hing. a confidence, on both fidesâ
that it be happy, if in all cases,
where treaties are in view, this open and
cone ilia t orjr -process. could take the place
of that relerve and mysterious r
on, with which the parties approach each
Other. Were Great Britain deiirous of
forming amicable arrangements by treaty,
he affced what readier or more prudent
step could file have taken for the purpose,
thap to have followed "the example set her,
by holding out in her laws, the spirit in
which Hie was willing to meet us in nego
ciation ?
on Mr, M.iitjoiis
Having gone through these explanati
ons, Mr. M. entered into a view of the
principal obje&ior.s to the " resolutions
proposed.
I. It was said they would diminish the
revenue, and endanger the funds.
With refped to the public debt, his
general ideas had been exprefled by several
who had spoken before him. He acknow
ledged that he had disliked and opposed
the modification given to it; but after it
had received the fanchon of law, he bad
entertained no other with on the fubjea,
than th.it the debt might be honorably
difeharged, as fact as the circumstances of
ttye country would permit. This he was
r well frtisfied was the prevailing sentiment
of the great body of the people, lie did
not believe, that there was a fingfe state
in the Union, or any considerable part of
a single state, that did not acquiesce (where
they did not approve) in the provisions
vyhich had been made in behalf of the pub
lic creditors. At the fame time he was
equally sure, that it never was either meant
-by Congress, or understood by the' public,
that in mortgaging the import for their
security, it was to be an hostage to foreign
countries for our unqualified acquiescence
in their unequal laws, and to be worrte,
as long as the debt (hould continue, as a
badge of national humiliation. The nature
of the obligation could certainly import no
more in favor of the creditors, than that
the fund appropriated (hould be applied,
as far as requisite, to their nfe ; unless e
quivalent funds (hould be substituted ; nor
more against the public, than that all de
ficienrfiei in the fund (hould be made up,
whether arising without, or in consequence
of, a change in the laws. If it (hould
happen,- then, that in consequence of any
mcafure, dictated by the general good,
the impofi: (hould become inadequate to
its objeÂ£t, all that could be exacted by the
public creditors, would be some other
provision that woiJd supply the defalca
tion ; and it ought not to be doubted,
that the people at large, whose good was
purfaed, would readily support whatever
other provision might become indifpenfi
ble. He had made these remarks, how
ever, with reference to an event, which
he did not by any means admit to be pro
bable. The more he had revolved the fub
jedl, the more clearly it appeared to him,
that a very operative addition might be
made to the duties on the enumerated arti
-cles, without endangering the Aggregate
product of the importations. Ai.d he en
tirely concurred in opinion with those,
who had observed, that the greatest injury
which' could be done to the class of citi
zens holding the public paper, was to re
present their interests as more to be re
garded, than any national considerations
whatever; and to oppose to the latter,
even the most imaginary contingencies to
the former.
(Speech to be continued.)

Resolved, That there be raised, armed
and equipped, fifteen regiments of auxi

and file each, with the proper officer*.
Resolved, Fhat the commiflioned *flp

States and any foreign European power,
they (hall be bound to serve for the term
of three years, after the commencement
of the war, if the fame (hall so long con

LEGHORN, Nov. 27.
Yesterday we witnessed one of the mod
dreadful catastrophes. Le Scipion, a
French fliip "(If 74 guns, carrying
600 men whicÃ was lying at anchor
in this port withthe Britifli lquadron un
der the command of Admiral Cofby, be
came a prey to the flames. At three
o clock in the afternoon, large columns of
black imoke, riling from all parts of the
(hip, were the fore r unners of the flames,
which began to break forth a few mo
ments after. The crew, who were almolt
all on board of her,& had not the fmalieft
luipicion of any accident, finding they
could not withstand the rage of the fire
mostly flung themselves thro' the flames
into the sea, every one driving to es
cape with his life. Mean while a great
number of the jolly-boats belonging to the
Bntilh, Swedilh, and Neapolitan men <
war, picked up many of the unfortun
lufferers, and a great number of dead 1 -
dies were afterwards taken up, fuffocatei
or.drowned.
The reft, being invalids, or Ivifhinir to
ratingmlh the flames, which Wan to
spread in every part, fell victims.
About 4 o'clock, all -the and
malts were seen on fire ; the port-holes of
the cannon resembled ft, maty furnaces if.
fmng a fiery lava. The guns, loaded ei
ther with grape (hot or balk, we ât olf,
and threatened to set fire to the reft of
the ihipping.
Rear-Admiral Colby, finding the squa
dron of his Britannic Majesty too near
the French (hip, and exposed' to the moil
imminent danger immediately failed from
the harbour. Shortly after, the French
Ihip bore away from her anchors all on
hre ; fortunately a strong gale from the
kind, had preferred the (hipping iâ the
harbor from definition,while Le Scipion
pal Ted along, and that prevented great
misfortunes.
About eight o'clock in the evening.
-Le ocipton was four Italian miles from"
the port, when the great explosion took
place in the store-room, containing 300
barrels of gun-powder. The column of
fire, rose to the height of near 300 fa
thoms ; a large smoke ensued, which ap
peared interfered with flames, and du
ring several minutes the whole horizon
leemed to be on fire.
The explosion was so great, that it rr
lembled the effect of the mod dreadful
(hock of an earthquake, and an immense
number of window panes in this city
burst. After the explosion of the flore
room, the water rushed into the body
of the hulk, which began to fink.
About two o'clock in the morning no
further fignt of fire appeared on the fur
race of the sea.
t ' >e morr| ing, a piece of the ship wis
14,11 fecn out of the water, full of coali,
and covered with bÂ«dies.It is (hocking to remark,that by a fire
which lulled only a few hours, a ship was
blown up, reckoned to be worth one mil
lion of piasters, besides 200 men of the
crew, including M. de Goy, the Cap
tian who would not quit her.
This dreadful accident is said to have
been occasioned by a barrel of brandy be
ing set on fire by a light which wa3 burn
ing near it.
. To the above loss we mufl add, that of
a great quantity of live ltock, and all
kind* of proviGon, destined for Toulon.

Since the late decisive engagement in

Letters from Italy (late, t
county of Nice, the campaign is ended
for this year. General Stafoldo, who for
the betterprotection of the valley of Sture,
had advanced into the French territory,
has, by the great quantity of fnovv; been
compelled to fall back, and to fend his
troops into wintei quarters.
Before the commencement of the ac
t:on of the his Serene Highne{j the
Duke of Brunfwick addrefled his army to
the following effect:â" This is the mo
ment to convince the Universe, that the
Prufiian troops are worthy of the glory'
which they formerly acquired. The ftle
of Germany is in your hands, and
upon the event of this battle, I proffiife
you not to quit the field while one soldier
ft:.;! remain ; and, as it becomes me, you
thall ever find me in the poll of danger at
your head-"
Tht. whole army, fired by this address,
(truck the ground with their firelocks, and
the Duke was personally engaged in every
attack.

Madame du Barre was executed on the 9th
inft. in the evening, on the Place de la Re
volution. Her behaviour was by no means
firm. The executioner was under the ne
cessity of supporting her in his arms during
the whole way. Being arrived at the foot of
the fcafTold, the two aiTiftants of the execuj*
tioner were obliged to lift her upon it.
When they were at the point of fattening
her on the plank, she exerted all her strength
and ran to the other fide of the fcafTold. She
was soon brought back and tied. Her head
was immediately struck off.

By Captain Brooks who arrived here
on Monday from St. Croix, we learn,
that the Judge of Admiralty at St. Kitts
has declared explicitly that he will not
condemn American veffels,,under the new
inftruftions from the British ministry,
which wi re publilhed in yelierday's paper,
as he held them not binding upon him for
that purpose. This accotint confirms that'
from Mr. Clafon's Captain publilhed a few
days fin.ee ; and from the chara&er of
Captain Brooks and his supercargo, who
gives the fame account, we venture to pro
nounce the intelligence authentic.
At the fame time, we were aflurcd that
at Montferat, all American veflels arc
condemned, if they have on board any
coffee, sugar or cotton from the French
lflands y the judge being, as it is suppos
ed, concerned in the privateers that cap
ture them.
MORE OF TOULON.
REMARKS, after the abandonment
Amid the diverse pofikions of the fleet
during this night, either to be less exposed
to the fire of the enemy, or to facilitate
the embarkation of many families, who
came by droves, in boats, compaflion and
pity seized the hardest heart ; the most
;t(humane could not endure tlie cries of
many without yielding to their felicitati
ons. On this oceafion fathers called for
their children 5 husbands for their wives ;
and each one for. relations and friends.
Several plunged themselves into the sea,
to overtake the veflels which were getting
uuder way, a gieat number of whom
were drownedâsome of them in despair,
seized their wives from their lying in beds,
to five them from the vengeful Infc of
their enemy.
This afpeft forced compassion even be
fore the hour of the horrid conflagration
had arrived ; all conduced with great se
crecy, not one of thofc fuccourt, which
could he procured for these unfortunates,
failed. They were all received on board ;
and there they had the consolation of fee
ing the rights of humanity fulfilled in their
refpeft.
To fee Toulon is to fee Troy; and the
comparison which such an afpeft causes
cannot be mitigated except by refledting,
that it is a punishment of God, fully me
rited by the henioufnefs of their crimes.
In fine, Toulon is loftâbut it has not
been delivered to the enemy ! Nor' will
they find it more, nor the forts on the fea
(hores, which heretofore guarded the Me
diterranean coasts, and environsâand this
anfwars the fame purpose as if wc still held
possession. Madrid Gaz.

5 " The most of the privateers of th
Engliih Islands have refortcd to this place
and made their Agent here, to bring in
qeutral vessels and Condemn them, because
they will not do it on the other Islands.
i find by examination that this is a law of
Montferat, and no where else. Veflels
coming- from England upon hearing of
this, directly come to this place, and feeing
thele Agents (whose names are Breeds)
tfcey immediately make them theirs also,
and then fail for Americans. Two such
have lately gone out, and have sent in
fcveral Americans who are condemned,
others are cruizing off Guadaloupe and
Martinique, and- may take the moll of
thf vefiels in those places, which we are
informed arc ail hundred In each of those
Iftands, unlas something is immediately
done.
" I would inform you that Capt. Let
ter of Norwich (whose fioop had been
taken and libelled) was on the morning
after his veflel was taken off by his mate
pitt into a most dismal jail among French
prifoher* snd negroes, but was by the pe
tition â¢>{ the Americans, liberated in three
day*i He is to wait for his trial till March
or April, and in. the mean time is without
friends, money or cloaths.

OBSERVER No. X.
Mr. Fenno,
Last evening, the Player's at the New-
Theatre gave us the tragedy called Dougla/s,
and a comic opera called The Farmer.
The Observer noticed with great fatisfac
tion, the decorum and good behavior of the
persons in the Gallery; such gentlemanly de
partment does them much honor, is a credit
to their caiSitry, and such (hould be the con
ducSt of j yyil and free people.
The entertainment was, taking it together
good, The Observer asks the players a ques
tion, Is it impoffihle to speak louder, and to
articulate better > Mr. Whitlock, Mrs. Whit
lo'ck, and Mr. Fennel excepted, the a&ors in
the tragedy were not heard, so well as could
bewilhed. *
Mr. Moreton will do well to correct a ra
pidity in speech, which is a fault, peculiarly
so in him, as the Observer is led to believe he
can corredl it with cafe.
One word to the ladies apd gentlemen in
the boxes, who poflefs such extreme sensibili
ty, that in the middle of a tender and affec
ting'fentence or gesture, they are forced to
clap their hands like boyÂ» in a mob. My
friends, your sensibility has an unnatural
mode of exhibition ; delicate sensibility, and
it would be infolentto suppose you pofTefled
sensibility without delicacy ; yes delicate {en
fibility, excited by grief, is rarely exprefTed,
by clapping hands.
The future numbers of the Observer, (hall
take up each acftor, and incident of the ref
peftive entertainments ; and in a few words
detail merit and demerit, notwitjithe cruel
ty of a critic or enemy, but with a kcred re
gard to truth.

It it wholly unnecefifary to expatiate on the

An Eflay on Slavery:
Designed to exhibit in a new point of view,
its effe&s on morals, indujlry, and the peace of
ocicty. Some fa&s and calculations are offered
to prove the labor of freemen to be much more
produflive than that ot flares ; that countries are
rich, powerful and happy, in propottion as the
laboring people enjoy the fruits of their own
labor; and hence the Dfctfily conclusion, that
slavery is impolitic as well as unjufi.
