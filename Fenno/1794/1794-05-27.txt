t S fl\ P T iar err Â° r ' or ihe fafety of
the state, by yielding to it. "
we sownH d T Â° W reac s e l the M hall, where
we tound Jimon and Zenocrate;, ene-aeed
in a very animated discussion. and furrE
ed by a very numerous crowd, who seemed
tohften with uncommon attention.

a-rald afterwards to miorm him upon m Jut 1
terms you tra! reftwr it. He has violated
your rights, why nal violate his ?
Good Heavens! laid Zeuocrates, when
has it become a rule hi politics, to decide up
on the mterelis of a Hate during thole violent
movements of the foul which pervert the
judgment, and change, in the fight of the
molt confederate, the true afpeA of things
To enable a people to determine wifely,
ought we to excite their passions, or render
them tranquil! Surely it is one iliing to ob
tain justice, and another thing to revenge an
insult. If, Athenians, you are of opinion
that war ought to be made upon Philip, on
account of the inftilt, it is very well; but if
your objeÂ«sl is only to obtain juitice for the
wrong Philip has done you, would it not be
prudent to put yourselves in a condition to
keep the town before you rcfolve upon seiz
ing it ? Timon telis you that Philip will ne
ver actempt to recover it, should you take
it; but how can Timon know 1 what Philip
inttnds ? Philip has committed a flagrant
violation of your rights, and Timon advises
you to become as criminal as Philip. I lhould
like better, O Athenians, to fee you conform
to the culloms of wife nations, the obliga
tions imposed upon you by justice, the dut ; es
of humanity, and the interests of the repub
lic. Call upon Philip to repair the wrong
he has done you, and as the town cannot be
removed, prepare to seize it with a Jiifficient
force, lhould justice be refufed, By this up
right proceeding you will be applauded by
mankind, and favoured by the Gods, who
abhor injustice and violence.
At a little distance flood Menilleus, ex
plaining and recommending to the Athenians
a new lyftem of commerce.
Menilleus always discovers ingenuity, said
Agathon; but his genius inclines him too
much to abilra<slions, or, as Crito exprefles
it, the occult qualities and eflential forms of
politics. I lis present proposal is not h s least
chimerical, and reminds me â¢of the project
of Epimac'hus, who believed that he could
change the position of the world by the pow
er ot mechanics : In like manner, Menilleus
thinks th::t he can transfer manufactures and
wealth from one country to another by a
fifcal operation, or resolve of the people of
Athens. It is to this turn of mind we ought
to afcr:bc his delight in metaphysical proba
bilities, above practical demonftt ations ; and
to the tincfture he has received from the vi
rions of his mailer, tliofe beautiful fyllems
so incompatible with experience and irredu
cible to prats ice. If from a rhetorican, Me
nilleus lhould ever happen to become a feha
tor, do you think that he could persuade the
Athenians, that it was good for them to de
molilh their fortifications, to be without gal- (
lies, to abidge their trade, and refill the in
troduction o' thole eftablilhments which have
increased the riches of other countries, and
assisted their governments with loans, in their 1
wars and emergencies ? These are among 1
the nl nii ii'.-rentier the Arhc i
nians more happy. The race of refiners, i
continued Agathon, have of % late greatly ]
multiplied; but, owing to the flourilhing
Hate of indullry, and easy circumstances in
which moll of the people find themselves,
their harrangues have as yet attracted few ]
pupils, save among the revolutionills, the '
discontented, and ambitious. |
I perceive Agathon, said Lyfander, 1
that you allow the refiners no merit for
their everlasting endeavors to please the I
people. I lhould be very far from cenfur- i
lug them, replied Agathon, for attempts t
of this nature, were they, instead of low t
and contemptible means, to employ only r
against those they abuse, superior virtue, c
knowledge, and genius. Are you sure,
Agathon, that the people would always
decide in favor of the latter, or that su
perior virtue, knowledge, and genius,
would invariably obtain their fuffrages > I
am sure, Lyfander, that no counterfeit
com can long continue to circulate, with
out losing the gilding that concealed its
baseness.
The fun had nearly arrived at the gold
en doors of the weft, and the throng and
the difputers were fall leaving the Lyce
um. Let us feat ourselves for a moment
on this vacant bench, said Lyfander, and
beg Agathon to indulge us with the con
clusion of the remarks, which our en
trance here has suspended. You forget,
laid Agathon, that we are to sup w ith
Anarchus, and that it is time to put our
selves in motion, if we would avoid being
the la(l of his gnefts- As to what I
have to fay, it can as well be talked over
| dunng our walk thither, and will serve to
| give a greater relilh to the animated fai
lles we may expert to have from the firft
wits of Athens we are to meet at supper.
â¢ Ihe accounts received yesterday, from
a neighboring republic, contain the sum
mary aâ de ff en f
R [ a, f Â°" the f "Â¥ct of our investigation.
Behold that republic, continued Agathon
so justly celebrated for the consummate
dillnbut.on of its powers, prostate and
..ruins by the usurpations of the people.
Its fundamental ordinances vested in an as
sembly the right of making law Ã , aild in
fe P V dsÂ£ ; , i httoap pÂ°i"t its mem.
* " afS^ned to the people freedom
of opinion, and the right to state to the
a (Terribly their opinions and grievances ;
and to the assembly freedom of debate and
the iihcontrouled excrcife of their judg
ment. Some of the rhetoricians held,
th it freedom of opinion meant fretdomof
abuse, and the right of the people to
state their opinions a right to dictate and
control. In time, the people believed the
new do&rine, and put themselves under
the banners of the rhetoricians. The fun
damental ordiance, veiled in a feledt body,
chosen by the people, the sole right to
make treaties ; the rhetoricians contended
that a different body might prescribe the
conditions. In time, the people believed
this too, and celebrated the difcOvey by
public rejoicings. The fundamental ordi
nance? defined the court in which, and
the persons by whom, the thief magistrate
might be impeached : The rhetoricians
said he might be impeached by clubs. If
the republic was threatened with war, the
rhetoricians declared againlt navies, and
armies, and taxes, as dangerous to liber
ty. Did the preservation of peace com
poit better with the welfare of the repub
lic, they urged the necefTity of meafure-s
calculated to prevent accommodation. If
the fitted man in the republic was appoint
ed ambassador on fiich an occasion, the
rhetoricicns invieghed bitterly against
fending any, and called upon the clubs for
their opinion. The rhetoricians held that
a proiperous state of the republic,- by ren
dering the people content, was the sure
forerunner as tyranny. To demolish this
â barrier against their power, it was necef
lary to render the mcafures which had
been inrtaumental to this prosperity, and
upon which much of it depended, odious
and detested. This was attempted by
falfehoods incefiantly repeated, and ascrib
ing the most mischievous intentions to the
most virtuous citizens. The weak, with
whom suspicions are always proofs, and
the wicked, in whom proofs of innocence
produce no change of conduct, oonfpired
alike to propagate the clamour, till, by
its violence and progress, it acquired a
kind of certitude in the minds of the
multitude. Their confidence in the most
tried patriots was converted into diftrull,
obedience to the laws into an intolerable
burden ; clubs into assemblies ; and every
citizen into a legislator. The crisis of
their fate was nearly arrived. Virtuous
men gradually disappeared from the pub
lic- cum.tila, -nirafalc xo ft em the Torrent of
disorder, or defparing to save the repub
lic. The rhetoricians composed toasts on
the occasion for the clubs, and took their
place, amidst the acclamations of thg- peo
ple. Thele, however, did not long ex
ercise the authority thus acquired. They
split into factions. Civil diflentions en
sured, andâ
At that moment we arrived before the
house of AmarchuSj who was conveifing
under the portico with Timoleon the po

none of these symptoms of disorder and

those who thought that a vigorous p r(pa .
ration for war was one of the bell means
to avert it; at all events, if it was thedc
sign of any nation to force us into it, we
ought to be prepared for it both as to mi.
litary strength and pecuniary resources;
admitting however that,this measure was
not contemplated it only produced a re
duction of 330,000 dollars from the sum
total of appropriations and would itill leave
a deficit in our ways and means of 1,105,
r * observed that the appropri
ations of the current year would exceed
those of any former year by upwards of
two millions and a half of dollars;
The several items which occasioned that
excess were as follows:
Building and equipping fix
frigates, 700,000
Fortifications of ports and
Building additional arsenals
and pu,chafe of military
stores, 350,000
Appropriation for foreign
intercourse, 1,000,000
Corps of artillerists and en
gineers, 170,000
Expences of militia, 150,000
v Dolls. 2,670,000
Deducing the expenses of the mili
tia, which was a war expence, still there
remained the sum of 2,520,000 dolls, as
an excess beyond any former expenles for
our peace ejlab!i/hment, for there was not
an item of expence in the foregoing
statement which would not, or might not
be incurred, even if peace Ihould conti
nue.
It was a fortnnate circumstance, at
this moment of public exigency, that tha
national treasury was in poifefiion of a
surplus, ariling . from the revenue of
former years, which furpafled our molt
sanguine expectations. This surplus
amounted to the important sum of
1,618,584 dollars, and was a mofl fatif
faftorv evidence of the growing produo
tivenels of our revenues in times ot peacc
and tranquility, and while it helped to
enable us to face the increafcd expendi
tures of the country, it taught us to che
rish that state of things, which was pro
ductive of such national blcllings. But
we could not flatter ourselves that the re
venues of this year would be as produc
tive as those of the preceding year; ma
ny circumstances would contribute to di
minilh them considerably, even if peace
Ihould not be interrupted ; the very prof
pe<st of a war would cause a diminution
of exports from Great Britain, to the
United States, and at the fame time a
diminution of consumption among our
selves : prudent men, apprehensive of war,
would retiench their expenses in order to
meet the diminution of their incomes,
and to be better able to contribute their
quotas to the public treasury. The mea
fnres which have been diicuTed in Con
gress, relative to a sequestration of Britift
debts, and a fufpeniioo of all commercial
intercourse, would, by deltroying that
%confidence which hÂ« heretofore cxifted,
unqueftioiiahly diminilh our importations
from that country, wh:ch principally mr
oiihes them. To these circumftauces
might be added, the derangements ocoa
fioned to the commerce of tiiis port by
the unfoituate epidemic lall lummer, to
that of ail liie ports by the present embar
go, by the extensive spoliations commit
ted on our veffeb by the belligerent pow
ers, and the interruption occasioned by
the Aigeiines to our commence with the
south of Europe. The committee, ta
king all these considerations into view had
calculated on a defalcation in the revenue,
arifuig firora unpoft and tonnage for this
year, of 1,300,000 dollars, and had esti
mated it at only 3,300,000 dollars where
as, that of 1793 produced 4,600,000 dol
lars.

DUBLIN, March 29.
The Englilh newspapers of Monday and
Tuesday are filled with a variety of re
ports.
Lord Elgin's arrival in London afforded
matter for strange speculation ; among
which the illness or death of the emperor
was one.
Others reported, that the Archduke
Charles' was gone to Vienna, in conse
quence of the news received at Brussels
from Frankfort, that the king of Prussia
had withdrawn himfelf from the general
alliance. It was also said, that the young
king had escaped from Paris, and was ar
rived fafe at Brussels.
it does not appear, that any account
whatever has been received in London of
the emperor's sudden illness; any more
than of the king of Prtiffia's having desert
ed the general alliance. The news of his
Prussian majesty's final intentions in regard
to the war, mud come from lord Malmef
bury at Berlin, and not fromPruffian agents
at Frankfort The report of the arrival
of young Louis XVII. at Brussels arises
from a young German nobleman of about
nine years of age, of great expectations,
having arrived there from Frankfort, from
whence he travels in fomeftate. The rul
ing demons of Pans have long held a mali
cious and obstinate silence, even as to the
exiuence of the young monarch, and his in-
J ured relatives.
We cannot help thinking that the report
(for as yet it is only a report) of the se
cession of the king of Prussia from thegrand
alliance, mud be totally unfounded. That
arl absolute monarch should degrade him
br a pecuniary capitulation with the
very dregs of mankind, and should conde
icend to treat with those, who have used
towels all ki "S s Â»hc most scandalous and

The arrests and executions at Paris conti
nue, in such a degree, that the number of
daily victims is incredible. The late reports 1
o> scarcity there, are attempted to be contra
dialed ; but by the measures taken to pre
vent monopoly, and to.-watch over the Tale
of their eggs and cabbages, it does not ap
pear that iamine is very far from tjieir doors.
The Gazette of the ajth intt. (which we
received yesterday) brought no information,
but the appointments of Lord St. Helen. to
be AmbalTador to the States General of tlie
United Provinces , and Sir Morton Eden to
his Chatholic Majesty.

FALMOUTH, March i S .
The Royal Charlotte Packet left Guernsey
011 Saturday morning tiie nd ; but having
got the length of the Galketts, it blew ftich
a gale of wind that /he was obliged to bear
away, and the fame evening came to an an
chor in Guernsey Roads.
She failed again on the 23d, and arrived
at Weymouth at 7 A. M. yesterday.
In her paflage, a-brealt of the Gaftetts,
almost two leagues to the westward of them,
Sunday, at noon, she fell in with admiral
Macbnde's squadron.consisti ng of four line
of battle snips, four frigates and a (loop of
war ; and two frigates arrived in Guernsey
Roads, the fame morning as the packet fail
ed, supposed to be part of the lame squadron.
The packet brings advice, that 011 Satur
day night seven large tranlparts with troops
ait.l Junes for Jersey, under convoy of two
frigates, a (loop of war, and an armed cutter,
arrived at Guernsey.
It was gene, ally believed at BiufTels,
when the la ft accounts came away, that
the King of Prussia had actually made a
compact with the Ruling Power in France,
in confequencc of which, his forces, his
contingent excepted, will be withdrawn
from the frontiers. We state this as
a mere report. Sun,
i he Carmagno'e, French Frigate, car
ties thirty 24. pounders, and is manned
with the flower of the remnant of the
I' rencli navy. She has hitherto proved
fuece'sful, not having met with any thing
near her proportion in metal. The Ar
tois, lying at Deptford, under the -corn*. I
maud of Lord Charles Fitzgerald, goes
out under a roving coinmilfion, and means
to fail into the track which this Republi
can veflel has for some f'rae occupied in
the North Seas. The Artois carries 28
eighteen pounders, and 6 nine pounders
011 the fame deck, 4 thirty two poundeYs
(earonnades) on the quarter deck, and
four nine pounders on the forecaftle.
The Danilh veflels are no small object of
this enterprize.
The Viscount Pioger, aid-du-camp to
the Marquis de Drefrny, the French Ge
neral who commands the Emigrants, came
to Weymouth in the packet, and we learn
that the Royalists on the banks of the
Loire are 80,000 strong; but that only
half that number are properly armed, the
reft having only (licks, clubs, or any wea

Yesterday was pregnant with rumours
of great importance.
The circumstance of the Arch-Duke,
Charles, brother of the Emperor and Go
vernor of the Low Countries, having sud
denly set oft" for Vienna on the evening of
the 19th, in consequence of an express
which he received, has given eife to much
conjecture and speculation at Bruflels.
We fliall state all the circumstances which
have come to our knowledge, and leave
the public to judge for themielves.
Yesterday Mr. Hankey received a let
ter from Bruflels, dated Saturday last, da
ting that the Arch-Duke Charles, in con
sequence of an express, set off on the e
vening of the 19th for Conde. He there
met with a Boy to whom he paid parti
cular refpeft. He brought him to Brus
sels the night of the 2tft, and on the
morning of the 22d they departed toge
ther for Vienna. That Boy, was suppo
sed to be the young King Â«f Fiance.â
This letter Mr. Hankey shewed to the
Minilter.
By an express from Bruflels, which left
that city likewise on Saturday, very different
accounts were received* Tbe general belief
according to this account, of the cause of
the Arch Duke's sudden departure, was,
that the Emperor was dangerouily ill, aud
according to some, actually dead.
The Earl of Elgin arrived in town yester
day morning at fix o'clock, having made an
uncommonly quick journey from Bruflels to
London. ,
;
We tear that the Prefidtntof the
States at the instance of the National Con
vention of France has recalled Mr. Morrisâ *
and has nominated Mr. Monroe a Senator
of the United States, from th<Â» state of Vir
ginia, to succeed Mr. Morris.âWe also hear,
that Mr. Carmichael is recalled from Spain,
and is to be succeeded by Mr. Short.
From Corkespondskts.
There has been much writing and har
anguing against the proposed duty on
and Sugar; the bug-bear of excise,
&c. has been brought forward ; but those
worn-out ideas have had as little effect as
the cry of the boy, who used to call out
Wolf, Wolf, on every occasion.
The truth probably is, that the Snujf
and Sugar manufafturies are so very lucra
tive, that a disclosure of the immense pro
fits some people have made, may excite
competition and diffufc those benefit*
which a fe<zu have monopolized.âl fine ii

The Public are cautioned to
beware of counterfeited Five Dollar Bills of
the Bank of the United States, and Twenty
Dollar Bills of the Bank of North America,
several of which have appeared in circulation
within a few days pajt; they are a good ge
neral imitation of the genuine Bills, but may
be dijlinguifhed by the following
MARKS.
Five Dollar Bills cf the Bank of the
United States.
ALL that have appeared have the letter F.
for their Alphabetical Mark.
The Texture of the Paper is thicker and
whiter and it takes the ink more freely than
the genuine paper.
The O. in the word Company is smaller
than theM. and other letters of that word,
so that a line extended from the top of the O,
to touch the top of the M, would extend con
siderably above the range of the whole word.
til the word United the letters are narrow
erand closer tbgether than thÂ« reft of the bill
The i and Jin the word proinife are not
parallel, the /inclining much more forward
than the i.
The engraving is badly executed,the strokes
of all the Letters are stronger and the device
in the margin particularly ismuch coarser and
appears darker than in the true bills. Some
of the counterfeits bear daie in 1791âWhere
as the Bank was not in operation till Decern
ber, and 110 five dollar bills were ilTued in
ihat year.
Twenty Dollar Bills of the Bank of North
America.
ALL that have appeared have the letter
B. tor their alphabetical mark.
They are printed on a paper nearly similar
to that of the couuterfeit Five Dollar Notes
above described ; the engraving is better exe
ucted, and they approach nearer to the ap
pearance of the genuine bills.
The fine ruled lines through the word Twen
ty) in the body'of the bill, are in number thir
teen in the genuine bills, and but twelve in
the counterfeits.
The word Company is much like the fame
word in the Five Dollar Bills as described a
bove, the 0 being less than the m, and others
following.
There is no stroke to the t in the word North
whereas in the genuine bills the stroke is well
defined.
The letters ent in the word Twenty, to the
left hand at the bottom, do not come down to
the line, but are so cut as to give an irregular
appearance to the word, the Tu> and go
ing below them.
The signature J, Nixon, has the appear
ance of being written with and
oil, and differs from other inks used in
printing the bills and the caihier's iignature.
It is luppofed these forgeries were commuted
in some ol the Southern btates, as all coun
terfeits thai have appeared, have eome
ihenci, and two perloos have been apprehend
ed in Viiginia,on (ufpicTon o? bt ugTTie Â« oÃtcr - -
of them.
The reward of ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS
wiil be paid to any Person or/ Persons who shall
difcovti and profecuie to convi&ion the leveral
offenders of the following de r mptions or any
of them, viz.
The person or persons, who manufzftured
the paper on which the Bills arc printed.
The person or persons, who engraved the
plates.
The printer or printers, of the bills.
Every perlon who has acted as a principal in
( aoy other way, in the counterfeiting and utter
ing the said bills.
r Philadelphia, March 28, 1794
April 22, 1794,
Other counterfeit bills
of the Bank of the United States have appeared
in circulation.
The denomination is of TWENTY DOL
LARS,and the alphabetical mark is the let
' ter B.
They may be distinguished from the genu
ine by the following MARKS :
The paper ot the counterfeits is of a more
tend r texture and glofley furface than the
genuine, and therÂ« is no water mark in them.
The letter C. in the word Cashier, in ihe
true bills is ftrongiy marked, whereas in the
counterfeits, the whole letter it a hair
stroke, evidently in an unfinifhed state. The
letter a in the word demand, is badly formed
and the whole word ill done, andtheie is no
comma at the end of it, as there is in the
j. genuine bills.
marginal device, ismuch daiker in
â¢ I,' Ik j t ' la " " le g enu '"e bills owing to
I ,6 1 ro^es being coarser, much nearer
I o g e ther, and consequently much more nu
merous. This difference strikes the eye at firft
view.
I 8 rcward of ON E THOUSAND
AUS, will be paid for apprehendinji, &
' P r "' ec "ting to conviction the several above
o<ftnder s in refpeft to this, as to
the last described bills.

Aliquid Temper ad communem utilitarem af
ferent nm. Cicero.
Tht Firjl American Edition.
THEgrand principle of Equality, if right
ly understood, is the only basis 011 which
universal justice, I'acred order, and per fed
freedom, can be firmly built, and permanent
ly secured. The view of it exhibited in this
eflay, at the fame time that it reprcll'es the
insolence of office, the tyranny of pride, and
the outrages of oppreflion ; coÂ«fiiniÂ», in the
mod forcible manner, the neceflity of subor
dination, and the just demands of lawful au
thority. So tar indeed, from loosening the
bands of focicty, that it maintains invioliUe,
every natural and every civil diftinaion,
draws more clolely every social tie, unites in
one harmonious and justly proportioned sys
tem, and brings men together on the even
ground of the inherent rights of human na
ture, ot reciprocal obligation, and ol 1 a com
mon relation to the community.
