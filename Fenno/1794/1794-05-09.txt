BRITISH HOUSE OF COMMONS,
March 17.
LA FAYETTE.
( Continued.)
Mr. Pitt, in the view of the fubjeft in
which he saw it, and the single point which
he conceived called for the conlideration of .
the House, in order to their decilion upon
the prefcnt question, did not conceive it ne
ceflary to follow che Honorable General thro'
a variety of topics which he had so ably alid
humanely urged, but which, in his opinion,
did not lead to that conclusion which it was
neceflary for them to look to. In narrowing,
however, the view which he meant to take
of the fubjedl, he d d not mean to be suppo
sed to agree to many of the positions laid
down by the Hon. General. Ofthefe topics,
one was the character drawn of M. Fayette,
which the laudable warmth of friendfhip
had depicted so highly; but of which, as
he entertained nearly the opposite sentiments,
he wilhed to decline fayinj any thing, but
merely that he was by no means ready to
admit the redlitude of his conduit upon ma
ny of those occasions which had been the
fubjeA of praise. Another point which he
was not inclined to aflent to; that those gen
tlemen weie confined contrary to the law of
war and of nations. It was admitted that
the capture of M. Fayette was by an enemy,
wh,t> could know nothing of him but as an
enemy and one who the day before actually
commanded the hostile army which we were
opposing; but it is said, that he was taken
in a neutral country; admitting this to be
true, the violation was only towards that
power whose Sovereignty was violated, and
could not be complained of as between the
two hostile armies. But the principal Objec
tion stated by the Hon General was, the treat
ment with which these unfortunate captives
were opprefied by the King of Prussia.â
Whatever that treatment might be, it was a
measure entirely of an independent fqve
reign, in which we could not be stated to
have aÂ«y, interference, either in its com
mencement, or its continuance; and to in
terfere with whom, in what pafled within
his own dominions, would be to depart from
the feledted and well-known rules eflablithed
betwe#n independent states, and setting our
selves up as the guardians of the consciences
of foreign states. But what were the-fpeciai
grounds upon which we were called upon to
exert this interference ? That the king of
Prussia had a flirted that those gentlemen
were to be considered as the common prison
ers of the allied powers, and that therefore
their fate must depend upon common con
tent. For his part he had already, as he now
again, denied, that this country had any hand
in this bufmefs one way or the other, npr
did he know upon what authority this decla
ration was attributed to the king of Prussia,
other than as it was stated in that Hcufe.
Admitting, however, the truth of the ex
pression having been uttered, it did not ap
pear to him that it could apply to this coun
try at all, inasmuch as at the time of the
capture, we formed no part of the alliance
alluded to, but were perfectly neutral. The
only ftther ground upon which the motion
was grounded, was the simplicity of tha
principles upon which M. Fayette was ftfp
pofed to have a<fled, and those which we
make the gronds ef our interference. Sup
pose that true, how Would the declaration
iffiied by his Majesty, to induce the French
to join our arms apply to him ? That only
promised prote&ion and support to those who
joined us as friends hereafter. But had M.
Fayette joined us at all, and could he be said,
therefore, to have come within the promises
therein contained ? Upon the simple grounds
therefore, of the impropriety of our inter
ference, and without attending- to the other
circumstances that did not apply, he found
himfelf obliged to oppose the motion.
Mr. Fox observing that the Right Hon.
gentleman who spoke last, had pwrpofely
avoided many of the arguments used by his
Hon. Friend,'he had contented himfelf with
limply urging his motion to be an improper
one. He had therefore left the arguments
of his friend unanswered, and they appear
ed to him still to stand with the fame force
and weight a 6 at firft. For his part, he would
not think of fupporfing the motion, by slat
ing auy thing personal with refp ft to the
unfortunate M. Fayette; although he had
some personal knowledge of him, but con
tent himfelf with observing, that if ever there
was one of a firm mind, temperate in times
the molt perilous, and a&ing to the last un
der the impression (rf one original and uiji-f r.-^^^BfIHjtiwRHBfeK^HBHMHfiHMnBsHMBSj^HGgi

lings, and the fucctis ottffjtcauu; which ]
she 7 pnofefltd to ftrppovt. Upon theft
grounds, tbeitfare, he declared his a'fent
to the motion of his hon. friend.
Mi- Burke, with his ufuai warmth,
commented on the affairs and misfortunes
attendant on the events of France ; the
miseries of which he principally attributed
to M Fayette, contending that we were
not called on in any manner to interfere in
his favor, aud declaring that when he
contemplated the numerous and aggravat
ed tries of rnifery that un
happy country, all compassion for the in
dividual was swallowed up in the general
calamity.
| Mr. Grey observed, that the right ho
norable gentleman who spoke la ft, had
declaimed loudly against the cruelties and
attrocities of the French. He did not
mean to argue on the irrelevancy of the
various topics which he had introduced,
but he conceived that we may draw a les
son from their cruelties, by ' abftairiing
â¢ rom that injustice, which cruelly confined
the unfortunate Marquis la Fayette in a
loathsome dungeon. He maintained, that
as we had no right to interfere with the
internal government of France, so it was
notjuft to inflict a punishment on that un
fortunate gentleman, for whatever consti
tution he may wilh to have established.
lie trusted that the unfortunate queen, in
her dying moments, esteemed la Fayette
roi his afliduities, aud the part which he
had taken in behalf of the royal family.
He observed, that by the declaration of
Lord Hood to the Toulonefe, they were
promised the couftitution of 1789, which
was the very constitution for which the
wretched Marquis la Fayette was an ad
vocate. If therefore it were the object of
the confederates to restore the ancient Mo
narchy, in preference to the constitution
of 1789, he affirmed that Great-Britain
would be juftified in withdrawing herfelf
from the pref'ent alliance to make a fepa- i
rate peace. Principles of justice and po
licy mould induce this country, he insist
ed, to interfere for the enlargement of
threfe unfortunate gentlemen, whose chief
crime was, in supporting that constitution
which Lord Hood offered to the Toulon
efe.
Mr. Pitt said, that Lord Hood, in con-'
lecyience of previous information with t&e
l.pulonde underitood that they had -no'
objection to enter into a negociation with
the Enghfti If they made a declaration
in favor of Monarchy, (ie agreed to fun
ply them and contribute to their wants
which was accepted, and afterward they
declared in favor of the confutation of
1789.
f i^ r ' F ,f declared tllat he conceived the
ast exactly as stated, which did not alter
the crcumflance, that this country had 1
bound itfelf to what had been stated by
his hop. friend. '
Sir Robert Thornton affirmed that all
parties with whom he had conversed, ex
claimed against the confinement of la Fay

fhou d induce us to interpose in his Lor,
and he was of opinion that there vvasfome

duit to that infortunate officer.
Mr William Smith said, that he was
mpelled to lay m his claim to argue again'!
our interference with the internal g(f,ern
ment of France. We were actually fall.
>ng into such error by punishing l a Fay
ette for the part which he had taken in
the revolut.on of France. It g ave himj

Mr. Fox declared, that from the con-
venation which he had with several persons
at Brighten, who h&d just returned from
Paris, and who were not the lead attach
ed to the Marquis La Fayette, he was
conyinced that none of those crimes could
be faitly attributed to him, with which
he was charged by those gentlemen who
opposed the motion.
Mr. Jenkinfon affirmed that he was iu
Paris at the time to which the Right
Hon. gentleman had adverted, when it
was generally acknowledged that he could,
if he plea fed, prevent many of the cir
cumstances lo much reprobated.
Mr. Martin returned thanks to the gen
tleman who had brought forwaid the mo
tion, as it gave hiia an opportunity of
demonstrating his abhorrence of the con
finement of this unfortunate gentleman.
He declared, that his'fevere punifliment
was the conversation of all parties through
out the country, and he trusted that the
House would vote for ths motion, not
lels through the motives of mercy, than
through the motives of found policy. Â»
Mr. Stanly declared, that he was in Pa
ris at the time adverted to by several gen- j
tie men who had spoke. He mull in jus- i
lite to the unfortunate La Fayette declare !
ie that he not only did every thing in his j
is power to prevent the circumstances that !
i- had happened, but rifqued also his own
i- personal fafety. He would therefore vote
1. tor the motion..
n Mr. Courtney infilled, that instead of
e .giving ofFence.to the King of Pruflia, he
e would be pleaied to have this country in
'â¢ terpofe for the liberation of his prisoner.
f He had disclaimed wishing to keep in con
: finement, and did it merely to please the
â¢ Confederates. He thought this court
e would do him a favor in removing him
- from the situation of a Royal goaler It
f was ft range logic to state, that all the
- cfimes of Roberfpierre, Marat, and Dan
â  ton, were to be attributed to La Fayette- I
i it would be equally jull to impute the ri
t ots of i 7 Bo to his Majesty's Ministers,
or Lord Amherft who was the command
er of the forces. Lord George Gordon
. . wa<! macle a prisoner by the mob,
but he never impeached the ministers for
the circumstance. Much idle declama
tion had been used with refpeft to the
atrocities committed at Paris, while not a
ungle cruelty committed by the Royal
â¢tiUichilts was ever mentioned. He did
mn conceive why. these Lords anointed
Ihould have a patent for fomenting anar
chy and confufion. HÂ« thought that a

HI. The reasons that his Prussia,, m _

1. By employing the peasants a K ainft

2. 1 hat there are not arms fufficient to

For the Gazette of the UnitedStatej.
â¢Mr. Fenno,
A writer in the American Brujels Gazette,
â¢ lrlfta Â»t, appears to be wonderfully
tickled with the number, objecl and descrip
tion of those persons who were prelent at the
Civic Feast on Saturday last. That the writer
and his companions experienced much plca
lui -j on the occasion is possible,âand if he
had remained fatisfied with giving us a def-.
cription of his feelings, without exaggerating
lome of the circumftauces upon which he
founds<his triumph.it would {lave been very
well. In order therefore to draw some fur
tfier information from this impartial biogra-
relative to the occurrences of that ever
memorable day, I stall beg leave to ast him
the following questions:
' Whether any body besides himfelf and the
Editor of the BrulTels Gazette afoiefaid, was
at the pains of ascertaining the number ot
persons who went out for the laudable put
pofes mentioned in his publication, and whe
tuer they amounted to two hunditd or
hundred ? Â° '
Whether all those who walked in the pro
ceflion or followed it, are to be considered as

From the General AJvertifer.
Mr. Bache,
During a period of a month or more you
have pybiiiked many pieces as from corres
pondents. Ail those pieces which relate to
the fubje<3 of negociation with Great Bri
tain, Mr. Jay as envoy, the executive in
making the appointment, those members of
C'ongrefs who favored n^oc':a:ion,&lately ill
refpeiting the funding system, are intended to
makefalle impressions upon the public mind.
As lorg as such writers wili fculk behind the
iimpenetrable veil of anonymous pub lications,
a refutation may, in a measure, be evaded :
Lut if your currcipbndents will come forth,
all or any of them, by name, and avow all Or
any of the fails so induftriou!:)' Iprrad among
the people, I will pledge myfelf to the
public, that a complete refutation (hall be
given to a'V the m'aterial facts allcdgcd in
those pui)!,.rations,vouched by names; names
who (hall ft.m l uriimpearh.ed in point of ve
racity, and who never owned a farthing of
public paper nor ever held an office under tbe
govetrifc.nt of the United Sutes. And more
particularly I pledge myfelf to the public, to
give demoiiftratiou, that every assertion, of
any importtiace, of your publication this
morning, taken from a pamphlet, entitled
" a definition of parties, &c." is twftn/ded
and in molt inftanies palpably falfe. Any
statement of farts, given to the public thro'
a newspaper, Oio'ild be true, but when the
molt importint interefis of community are
aimed at by fa'f; publications, the cvlprit

Let us tr.ke of/ all tories, at a general
f u'tcp fays the General Advertiser.
Just so in England Scotland and Ire
land. Th.e court minions lay, away with j
all authors and printers that publish the
Rights of Manâthey ate dangerous, libel

Ju!l so in France, Drown, (hoot and
guillotirte everyilderaKftâevery moderate
âall the monied ariltocracyâWhat, one
have more money than a uother ?and with
to keep it too ! Away with such men ! A
man who thinks a Fu!ir.il Government bet
ter than an Ind:<ujfeblf Repuilic,is not fit to

not think as we do ! so fay the Mountain.
Away with all nev.'{p?pers, all pedlars
and tinkers, fays the king or Spamâ-away
with these traitors,incendiaries,thefe hawk
ers of trench books and Jacobin princi
ples Let none of these fellows disturb our
way of thinking. So also the Empress
of Russia, the King of Prussia and the
Emperor of Cermany.
Strange indeed to tell, but an incontesta
ble fact, that the democratical people in
America, the warmelt friends ofthe French
are the very men, and the only men who
commit or threaten violense for freedom
of writing and speaking. The mobs in
C harlefton and Virginia have attempted
the tyranny of George 111. or the King of
Spain, by means something different, but
equally detejlable. The burning men in ef
figy and the threats pronounced against
their perfons,the guillotine and the general
ftveep of Philadelphia ; what are these but
attempts to restrain the privilege of speak
ing and writing. ]f a printer publiflies what
taey do not like, they will threaten to pull
down his house. What is all this, but the
tyranny of George 111. or of a Ruffian
Empress, excrcifed in a more summary
and more frightful manner ! Has not a
man in America the fame right to publish
â  his sentiments, as Mr. Paine in England
Mr. Muir in Scotland ? You fay these
men are perfccutedâbut is it not persecu
tion to burn a man in effigy, or threaten to
tcirdcwn his house! You fav theft men
in Great Britain wrote in faro- ef liberty.
' they did foâarxl so do people here wl.c
write again ft mobsâLiberty rpnfilts-in a
right to do what a man pJtufts, not con
trary to the laws of the count ry and to
the legal rights of our fell jw citizens.â
Then Paine and Muir were right,andeverv
man in America, in Congrds or out, has
the fame sacred right to speak and publilh
his opinions. Any, the leaf! attempt toa
bridge that right, is defpottfm, whether by
a long expenlive trialâtransportation
and impriforiment; or by tarring and
feathering men, or by threatening them
with a generalfweep. It is very remarka
ble, but true, that in foreign countries the
Court or Government attenpts to reitrain
the freedom of speaking and printingâin
this country, the friendsof our government
encourage that freedomâand certain clubs
of the people endeavor to rettrain it.â
The tables are turnedâln Europe the
Kings and the v Nobles think their rights
in danger from freedom of difcuflion ; here
the Genet begotten ekibs abuse every man
as an enemy to his country, who opposes
their arrogant afTumption of powers.â
Thefc clubs are become the tyrants of
America.

interfere with our own, and every propoii

war, or which is worse, confulionâbut
while their measures tend to war, they op
pose every proportion for raising those fup

FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE.
a- LONDON, March 18.
DECLARATION of his Prussian Majesty,
delivered to the States of the Germanic
Circles, aiiembled at Frankfort.
His Majesty the King of Prussia could not
but hear with the higheit difpieafure, that
dehgns were imputed to him tending to fc
cuhrize Bishoprics and Chapters, to suppress
them, and to appropriate to himfelf certain
S- rh * Â£m P" e > in or(fer to indemnify
himleli for the lmmenfe expences which he
has made for near two years, to carry on the
war againlt the French, and to defend against
them the Germanic Empire and his illustri
ous allies.
His Majesty, confident that his designs are
pure, might pals in silence over such ru
mours, and eontent himfelf with the convic
tion that they would find no belief on the
part of the well-disposed States of the Em
pire : but to give an overplus of fatisfaftion,
and to confound the malevolent, who invent
(imilar stories purposely, and perhaps to ex
cite distrust, the undersigned has orders form
ally to declare, that while his Majesty makes
war upon the French, he has never any view
but the defence of the Germanic Empire,
and the maintenance of the Constitution ;
that it never was his Majesty's design to
make conquests for himfelf; and that if con
quells are made from France, the Empire
will have its share ; that he never conceived
the least idea of indemnifying himfelf at the
expence of the Empire, whafe Constitution
has always been sacred to him, and for whose
maintenance he has already made so many
faenfices, as is generally known.
The undersigned finally declares, that his
Majesty will never belie those intentions in
future, and be always ready to secure and
guarantee to the Germanic Empire its terri
tory and Constitution, and to its States in
particular, both spiritual and temporal, their
polTeffions and rights ; in a word, the invio
lable maintenance of the whole Germanic
body, provided the Empire, and above all
those fix circles which are molt exposed to
danger at the present, will co-operate as
much as the Constitution and patriotism re
quire of them.

she Public are cautioned to
'ware of counterfeited Five Dollar Bills of
be Batik of the United States, and Twenty
dollar Bills of the Bank of North America,
"i<erui of which have appeared in circulation
uithin a few days pajl; they are a good ge
neral imitation of the genuine BilLs, but may
if difiinguifhed by the following
MARKS.
Five Dollar Bills of the Bank of the
United States.
ALL that have appeared have the letter F.
"or their Alphabetical Mark.
The Texture of the Paper is thicker and
whiter and it takes the ink more freely than
the genuine paper.
The O. in the word Company >.s smaller
than the M. and other letters of that word,
so that a line extended from the toj>of the O,
to touch the top of the M. would extend con
hderdbly above the range of the whole word.
In the word United the letters are narrow
erand closer together than the reft of the bill
The i and /in the word prcmife are not
parallel, the yinclrtiing much more forward
than the i.
The engraving is badly executed,the ftrokis
of all the Letters are stronger and the device
in themargio particularly ismuch coarfcr and
appeal's darker than in the true bills. Some
Â©i the counterfeits bear date in 179* âWhere-
as the Bank was not in operation till Decern
ber, and no five dollar bills were issued in
j at year.
Twenty Dollar Bills of the Bank of North
America.
ALL that have appeared have the letter
B tor their alphabetical mark.
They are printed on a paper nearly similar
to that of the couuterfeit Five Dollar Notes
above described j the engraving is bette> exe
ucted, and they approach nearer to the ap
pearauce of the genuine bills.
The fine rulecj through the word Iwen
ty 7 in ttie body of ihe bill, are in number thir
teen in the genuine bills, and but twelve in
4.he counterfeits.
* The word Company is much like the fame
â¢word in the Five Dollar Bills as delcr ibed ij
bove, the 0 being less than them, and otheis
following.
There is no stroke to the t in the word North
whereas in the genuine bills the stroke is well
defined.
The letters cnt in the word Twenty, to the
left hand at the bottom, do jiot come down to
the line, butÂ«re so cut as to give an irregular
appearance to the word, the Tw and the> go
ing below them.
The fignaiure ], Nixon, has the appeal
ance of being written with lamb-black and
oil, and ditiers trom oiher inks ulcd in
printing the bills and the cafliici's lignature.
It is supposed thele forgeries were commuted
in some ot the Southern States, as all the coun
terfeits thai have appeared, hsve come from
thcnce, and two perions have been appiehend
ed in Virginia, on being the auihor
of them.
The reward of ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS
will be paid to any Perlon or Persons wlio lhall
discover and piokcuie to convi&ion the several
offenders of the following defcnptions or any
of them, viz.
The person or persons, who manufaÂ£tured
the paper on which ihe Bills are pnnied.
The person or peilous, who engraved the
plates.
The printer or printers, Â«f the bills.
Every person who has acted as a principal in
any other way, in the counterfeiting and utter
ing the said bills.
PhiladelpUia, March 28, 1794
April 22, 1794,
Other counterfeit bills
of the Bank ol the United Â£>t ates have appeared
in circulation.
The denomination is of TWENTY DOL
LARS,and the alphabetical maik is the let
ter B.
They may be distinguished from the genu
ine by the following MARKS :
The paper of the counter tens is 0/ a more
tender texture and gloiley furface than the
genuine, ai)d there is no water mark in them.
T he letter C. in the word Caihier, iy the
true bills is strongly maiked, whereas in the
counterfeits, tjrc whole letter is a fine hair
stroke, evidently in an unfinished state. The
letters in the word demand, is badly formed
and the whole word ill done, and there is no
comma at the end of it, as there is in the
genuine bills.
The marginal device, is much daiker in
the falfe, than in the genuine bills owing to
the shade strokes being coarser, much nearer
together, and consequently much more nu
merous. This difference fir ikes the eye at firft
view.
The fame reward of ONE THOUSAND
DOLLARS, will be paid for apprehending, &r
Prosecuting to conviction tjie several above
described Offenders in refpelt to this, as to
the last described bills.
