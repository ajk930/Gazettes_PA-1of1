,â¢ M ""- Gilcs ' s reply to Mr. W. Smith's ob
( lervations on the palling of the naval
, armament bill.
( Continued.)
Mr. Giles observed that it had Jjecn
said and repeated in the committdÃÃk
t. i proposed measure, was war. lajoS
nied that the measure in ttfelfvns w* or
that it furnifhed a jufl oaufe of war. He
believed, however, that it was problema
tical whether it would eventuate in peace
or war; indeed, he remarked, that the
crisis of affairs is already such i that whe
ther the measure be adopted or not, he
viewed war as a probable event, peace as.
a poflible event ; but the point he con
tended for was, that if the
towards the United States be fulficient to
juftify reprisal, the exercise of the right
dpes not furnifh a just cause of war. The
exercise of a right by one nation, can ncv
ver involve the absurd consequence, of
giving another nation the right to exercise
a iwrong.
He said that gentlemen on one fide of
this ; question seemed to ast upon an ima
ginary, instead of the real state of things,
he was not therefore aftonilhed at hearing
the committee cautioned against the viola,
tion of neutrality.
He did not conceive that the present
state of things between the Unjted States
and Great Britain would juftifv the use of
the term Neutrality. Neutrality is a
term used ta fignify the relation, in which
two nations stand towards each other
Neutrality, therefore requires two parties;
either party may destroy the relation of
things between the parties. It therefore
appeared absurd to him to fay that Great
Britain was in a state of depredation and
war towards the United Statesâand the
United States in a state of neutrality to
wards Great Britain, It has been said
that the United States have not abandon
ed their neutralityâthis is trueâbut it
is no evidence that neutrality exists.
Great Britain has abandoned it for them.
He said however, that this was disregard
ing the substance and entering into a mere
cavil about names.
It was not material in his opinion/what
name ought to be given to the existing
relation of things between the United
States and Great-Britain: Whether it
was called a state of pcaee, a state of war,
a state of neutrality, a state of reprisal, a
state of retortion, or a state of"very unci
vil conduct on the part of Great Britain s
nor did he conceive it material to afcer-
â¢J .
V* * ''i Â«â 
I
4 'tai i, whether there were any intermediate
(tages between a state of peace and a (late
of war ; or in which ftatc the depreda- |
tions of Great Britain (hould technically
bÂ« classed : but one thing was certain and
material: that the United States had sus
tained fubjlantial wrongs which required a
fubjlantial remedy. Gentlemen who hÂ»ve
regarded names and disregarded fubltan
ces, have also been extremely alarmed at
of a discrimination of conduit by
States towards foreign nations.
A gentleman (Mr. Boudinot) observed
yesterday, that the United States had sus
tained injuries from France and Spain as
well as Great Britain, and alked why there
(hould be any diicrimination in their favor.
Mr. Giles said he was extremely hurt, that
the conduct of France (hould be so unne
cefiarily and unopportunely arraigned in
that House. He submitted it to the gen
tlemen to fay, if the United States (hould
be compelled' to enter into the war, which
was at this moment not an improbable e
event; whether it would be wife to irri
tate the only nation in the world who
could afford them any substantial affilt
ance. He said that this conduit was the
less juftifiable from the recollection that
the conduit of France, was the result of
neceflity, and that there was every reason
to conclude, that the conduit of that nation
would be explained in a fatisfactory man
ner. But a confederation mentioned by a
gentleman (Mr. Smith, M.) yesterday,
was a conclusive answer. The United
States owe to Fiance a pecuniary obliga
tion, as well as one of a morefacred nature.
This is at all times fufficient for their in
demnification. With refpeit to Spain, if
the gentleman would (hew the injury sus
tained and point fund for indemnifi
cation, Mr. Giles declared he would not
hesitate a moment to apply it to that ob
jeit.
\
â¢Vui
But will the gentleman conclude, that
because one nation has injured us in a de
gree, against which we have no redress ;
that therefore we shall not indemnify our
selves from a nation which has injured us
in the extreme, and against which we have
the moit ample redress !
He believed the gentleman's coolness,
his wisdom and his deliberation could not
possibly lezd him to such a result. With
respect to discrimination in the conduct of
States towards foreign nations,
grew out of the character of
KeTpiidnct of other nations towards the
IMm States.
To keep France out of the comparison,
let this indifcrlminate conduct, fp much
applauded, be applied to Great Britain .
and Holland :âGreat Britain destroys
our trade, plunders our property, and to
her injuries! adds insults and contemptâ
Holland engaged in the fame cause, fofters
our trade, and refpedts us as a nation.
Under these circumstances do gentlemen
contend that an indiscriminate conduct is
due to Great Britain and to Holland}
Or do they mean to carry this delicate in
discriminate conduct so far as to refufe to
themselves all redress from one nation ;
because they would wilh to deal out the
fame conduct to all others, whether they
had offended or not ? He said that discri
mination was damped in the front of the
conduct of foreign nations towards us;
and to make an indiscriminate return
would be the worst and most unjust of all
discriminations. He hoped gentlemen
would pardon him, but he could not help
thinking that they had carried their ideas
upon this fubjeft to the most fanciful ab
surdities. A gentleman (Mr. Smith, S.C.)
yesterday remarked, that of late the con
dition of war had been much ameliorated
as it regards the rights of property, and
he thought the amelioration ought to be
extended rather than abridged. Mr. Giles
declared that he heartily joined him in his
wifties, that the condition of war would
ere long be ameliorated both as it regards
property and persons.. He hoped that
mankind would soon learn more wisdom
than to butcher each other for the amuse
ment or security of the privileged orders
of the world. From that source he be
lieved all wars arose, and until the cause
was banilhed f-om the earth, he feared
the fatal effects resulting from it would
continue to exist. He declared that he
ihould view the banishment of the privile
ged orders from the world, as the surest
harbinger of the approach of the milleni
um. But this is not the happy period of
the worldâFor although the United
States are free from this pest of the hu
man species in their internal organization ;
yet the evils, they at this moment experi
euce, arift from their external intercourse I
with that part of the world which is less
fortunate. The attack made on the Unit
ed States at this it.onierit, is an attack up
upon property, if thert fjiould be a war
between the United States and Great Bri
tain ;it will be a war of property. Un
less there should be a species of madness in
the nation not to be calculated upo'n, they
cannot think of invaiion and lubjugation.
It is known that the United States cannot
make an attack upon Grest Britain ; and
territory' and con Que ft with them are no
objects. Hence the war will be confined
to depredations upon property. This is
the moll dishonorable species of warfare,
and therefore the more to be regretted.
There is this obvious diftinftion however
between the United States and Great Bri
tain. With Great Britain, at leajl with
the privileged orders, it is matter of choice
âwith the Ut/!ted States it is matter of
compuliionâthe United States despise
this mode of warfareâthey covet not the
property of any nation upon earth, but
felf-prefervatiori demands it. T hey are
under the strong hand of a powerful nation,
despising their rights, and regardless of
justice. In this state of things there is but
little hope of strengthening the sacred ties
of property âFor in the example of Great
Britain, her late conduct, can farnifh no
consolation for these theoretic {pecula
tions; and however the United might be
inclined to practice upon them, yet the
Briiifh depredations will forbid themâfor
submission will be an invitation to new
acts of aggrefiionâhe mod ardently wish
ed the state of things were otherwise, but
exposed to these inconveniences, the mod
effectual means ought to be adopted for
their refiltancc.

Mr. Cushing,
T AM â r .f rt- . . â
f'Â«r
I AM a high foil of libertyâand sin
cerely wifli the guillotine may be the portion
of every one who does not think as 1 do. I
am a true friend to the freedom of the press
âand think the Printers ought to put tfa â¢
freely every thing offered them on the right
fide of public queltionsâand to be turned
out of their employment if they publish on
the wrong fide. lam considerably older
than you are, Mr. Cutting, and am there
fare wiser by the experience ofcage; and
besides, I have more monev, and have for- 1
merly been a member of the' House, and mult
therefore be allowed to know more about
politics than you, or even than men of equal
age and property with myfelf, who have
been conanÂ£d to the riarrofy waiks of private
life. These things being considered, it will
plainly appear, that I ought to keep an eye
over the Editors of newspapers ; for if these
fourcesof information become impure, those
who drink of their streams willbe poifonecl â
and if men of my importance don't give
leflfons to the Primers, who will ? The Prin
ters, Mr. Cufhing, have it in their power to
do more good than any class of people what
everâif they would not contradict each o
ther, they would have none to contradidl
them ; and so they might make all their rea
ders think alike, ail alikeâand in the course
of time, I hive no doubt, to even look Alike
âand if you get them all to think, a<ft and
look on the right fide of things, what a hap
py people (hould we be !
Now, Mr. Printer, you did very wrong in
your last, (and I have heard twenty people
fay the fame) to publish the pieces signed
"An Eledlor and " ElTex"âit is your
duty not to publish any thing for tiofe arifto-
dogs, who don't think as I do about
certain men. Don't you fee that they want
to enslave us allâto overset our state govern
ments âto destroy the freedom of thinking,
and speaking our minds about public men
and public measures ? Why 'tis as plain as
the nose in your faceâand if you continue to
print for such tyrannical lordlings, you are
no better than a traitor to your country, and
will deserve to be sent to France, to be made
a head fhorte*. Indeed nothing saves you
from present damnation, but the piece which
followed, signed " A Merchant. Now there
you did right, to publish in favor of the old
Patriot ot '75 âonly it ought to have put
him up for Governor, inilead of that crafty
anftocrat, Jcdje Cufhing, who wants to sue
all the States.
Now, Mr. Printer, if you mean to con
duct a Free Press, which is eflential to liber
ty, don t print any more for those people
whose sentiments tend to the deftruftion of
all freedom. They are rank old Tories, who
with to throw us into the hands of Great
Britain, as they did in '75. We have now
too many of her friends Hinging us in our
bosom. And mark a certain class, and watch
them narrowlyâthey are the most danger
ousâl mean some who are continually blus
tering in the llreets about the Britilh, aad
pretend they would facnfke money, limbs
and life, to revenge their in r ulis, .and crulh
their powerâwhen, all the time, they keep
open (hops for the faleof liritifh manufactures,
Which you know are the very sinews of
their strength ; and to cut which, would at
once revenge their injuries, and make the
haughty Briton crawl at our feet.
If you <hould have any more electioneer
ing or political pieces, Mr. Cufhing, fliow
thtm to me, and i will tell you whether they
will do ro prim. T'~T" '

Friday, Dec. 23.
A commifiary of war appeared at the
bar, and wished to be heard, when Tome
contention ensued. \
Bourdon of Oifeâ" It is truly alion
| idling that you fhouid refufe to hiar a
man who comes to denounce the non-exe
cution of the laws, and to entreat the
Convention to break the chains of 1000
brave Republicans, wholanguifh at Mentz
through ehe neglect of the Minifler at
War."
The CommifTary of. War being per
mitted to speak, said "'When Mentz was
evacuated, the Prussians detained 1000
Frenchmen as hostages, till the expenses
of the departure of our columns, and those
of the hospitals, fhouid be defrayed, and
all their debts paid.
" Tired of their long and rigorous cap
tivity, our unfortunate brothers in arms
obtained leave for one of them to come
to Paiis, to demand the execution of the
law. That citizen is arrived a month a
go. He vainly ran forwards and back
wards tnrough the war offices, and to the
national tve'afury. The one sent him b?ck
to the other, without coming to any point.
Mean while those brave Republicans act.
Sans Shoes, Sans Stockings, Sans Shirts,
Sans Money, Sans everything ! They are
quite naked, and many of them xvM pe
rish through the inclemency win
ter, if the Convention does not relive
them."
Bourdon would not flip this opportu
nity to inveigh mod violently againfl the
Minilter at War; and moved, that Boa
chotte be summoned immediately to the
bar, to account for the delay of rcleafin-r
those hostages.
The Convention decreed, that the mi
nilter be summoned to the bar during the
present fitting. 6
A young maiden complained of the
hard and cruel treatment which (he expe
rienced on the part of her parents, for rc
fufing to marry a man w'hom flic does not

gislation.
The Convention patted a long decree,
refpefting the plan of national educa
tion.
Bouchotte, the war minister, appear
ed at the bar, and read several written
documents, tending to clear his conduct
with regard to the TOOO hostages ftif] de
tained at Mentz. He proved, that ever
since the end of last August, he gave or.
ders to pay the enemy the sums stipulated
for the enfranchifement of those hostages
and that he had since feiit confiderabl,
Turns for their support.
r rÂ»;r.
Bourdon of Oife observed, that those
urns ought to have been sent fix tnonths
Jgo. He read a letter signed Brunfwick.,
granting permillion to let pass the sum of
20,0c0 crowns, expended by the priion
ers at Mentz.
Referred to the committee of public
welfare.
Saturday, Dec. 14.
Lecointie of Versaillesâ" About tbc
latter end of October, we received feyeral
denunciations against an armed force, cal
ling itfelf revolutionary, commanded by
Turlen, Aid-du-camp to General Htu
riot.
The commonalties of Tliieux, Jully,
and others of t'ue dillrift of Meaux, have
been the victims of its robberies. At
Corbeil the fame infamous tranfaftions
have taken place, and the particulars at
tending them are so attrocious as to make
one shrink back n-ith horror.
" On the 30th of November, a detach-
mcniXJr mat armeu iorce, torming a kind
of van-guard, all armed with hangers, and
girded with pistols, entered at ten o'clock
at night the dwelling- of Citizen Gilbon,
the father of a family of eleven children
âan old man, part 75 years of age, jnd
a farmer at Tigery, near Corbeil, who
keeps three ploughs. Having entered
the kitchen, the chief of the horde gave
orders to a piquet of 50 men, forming
the corps of relerve, to remain v ithout
doors, to guard the house and waggon
which followed them.
" He asked what was the name of the
citizens piefent, and who wasthemafter?
Being answered that the latter was in bed,
he went there, forced him to put on his
cloaths, and demanded that all the arms
be delivered up to him. The wife of
Gilbon delivered a hunting-piece, the on
ly article of fire-arms which the house
contained ; then the whole horde seized
the body of old G.lbon, dragged him in
to an adjacent room, (Iruck, bound anj
handcuffeded him with his hands behind
his back, tied them down to his feet, and
covered his head with a sack. Tie wife
and tenfervants, two of whorJPpt fe-
shared the fame fate. Then
those ruffians demanded of Gilbon the
keys of his dnwjrs and chest, " to veri
fy," said they, " if they could not find
some fleurs de-lys, or some other aiticlcs
contrary to law."
" Gilbon prom!fed obedience if they
would untie his hands. They refufed,
searched and wrested from him his keys.
No sooner were the dpors opened, than
the ruffians seized and carried off 26 co
vers, a soup soup and ragoo
spoons, and 3 marked Louis
Gilbon, 2 fnuff boxes, 40 counters, and
2 watches, all made of silver t another
watch in a geld cafe, and various other
effects, efpeciallv a gold cross and a silver
key chain which the wife of Gilbon was
then wearing : They tore the cross from
her neck, faying they would take a proces
verbal of it as fc on as they should be oniet
and easy at Melun, and that those effects
were to be can icd to the waggon which
â  cmaitied before the door with the etai t.
then asked Gilbon, wberrwas
hixcouied specie ? " If thou dclt not de-
tc!sÂ®J* it," said one of them, " the guillo
tine is at the doorâl will be thy executi
oner." Gilbon prayed to be untied, that
he might point it out. They carried hun
off afeconj time into his kitchen 1 , where
they said to him, "we will make thee
ling."âThey left the reft bound down in
the hall, dragged old Gilbon close to the
fire, and applied his naked foot folk's to
the burning coals ! âHe uttered a dread
ful scream ; terror and consternation feizcd
the whole house; the ruffians retired,
breaking a chest pointed out to them, in
which they found and carried off 72 livres
i'i specie, and between 5 and 600 livres
more, in affignats, which he had jult re
ceived 2s the piice of his corn in requifiti
-011, which he fends every day to Corbcil,
to supply Paris.
" These monsters, not contented with
their booty, broke the cellar doors, iet off
a calk full of vinegar, and took the sup
per and the wine of the family; and at
midnight, satiated with cruelty, and ine
briated with wine, they retired, leaviwg
the whole family in the ropes and mana
cles with which they had bound them.
" A pmetis verbal, taken by the juf
tlce of peace of the cantoit, accompauied
by the municipal officers of Tigery, and
by the fnrgeon of Corbeil, who had been
called to dress the wounds and contusions
of Gilbon & his people,prove the authen.-
ticity of the fadls of which I have jult
given a feeble (ketch.
" I mull inform you, citizens, that
such is the stupor of the country people,
that the unfortunate who fuffer torments
of this kind, durst not complain, deem
ing themfclves but too fortunate to have
escaped death.
" All that bears the name of armed
f <rce, now iiifpires thein with the utmost
terror; and your ears would not even
now be struck with this atrocious narrative
if Gilbon's son, who is my farmer, had
not hsd an opportunity to come to me
refpeÂ£ting foiue other business."
Andre Dumonl, representative at Ab
beville, wrote from that place December
10, that he left Amiens, after having
thrown into prison the agents of the re
bels. He further Hated, that he came
to Abbeville to ccicbratc a fete to Re-.ifon,
which was folemnizcd upon a mountain ;
a prieit, released from prison, was there
married to the widow of a soldier, in the
pretence of 7000 persons. He burnt all
â -the feints,- fawthe goddds ot" iibertv test
ed upon a palanquin, and heard a civic
fer#lo,-1 which terminated with
the oaths taken by the people to extermi

of La Vendee.

This would seem to be confirmed by the

PHILADELPHIA,
APRIL 12.
By Capt. Drinkwater from Portland, dif
tri# of Maine, we learn that a vellel arriv
ed there the last day of March, on board of
which were 6o American seamen, who had
been captured in the Weft Indies.
The number of American captures in the
Weft Indies has been gradually encrealiog in
the Newspaper accounts till it now amounts,
according to an estimate published tn a Char
lellon paper, Â» to not fcris than fix hundred
fail." r â¢
It has that the Amluf
cade French Frigate, had captured and
carried into Norfolk, the British Frigate
Hussar, on Thursday the 3d inft. The
Virginia Chronicle, of Saturday the sth,
contains no account of this affair.
The (hip Charleston, Capt. Garman, fails
for Charleston to-morrow morning. On
board this veiTeli are lhipped 28 pieces of hea
vy brass howitzers, and brai's and iron can
non, with their carriages, &c. also a large
quantity of cannon ball, &c. belonging to
the magazines of the United States, and sent
to Charleston for the defence of that har
bour.
A sensible Quaker in London, hearing ma

rican war, and fay it was nursed and spun
out for the emolument of Generals, Admi

he could promise- a plan to have all wars
brought rj 1 speedy conclusion. It was to
allow all officers by sea and land full pay in

that the Senate had not found him guilty of

A Guillotine! a guillotine in America !
What, this terrible instrument of death,
that chops off heads, as a butcher's cleav
er fevers the joints of a quarter of lamb !
Bless our hearts and fouls! Let us go to
town and fee the engine of the King of
Terrors, that mows in
France like noisome weedslH
Well, what is a guillotine a ma
chine as simple as a turner's lathe, or a
b'ack-fmith's vise. It is not half so great
a curiosity as Kingfley's brick-mill, or the
new machine for clearing wheat ; and the
machines used in the cotton manufactures,
are infinitely more ingenious works, and
as much greater curiosities, than the guil
lotine, as a ship is greater than an Indian
canoe !
Yet all the world mull go to fee the guil
lotine : I am glad for the fake of citizen
Baker i but tell me, gentle readers, why
ciiMhzed man delights to hear of blood and
llaughter, and to fee even the inllrument of
the horrid business ? j
Is man a tyger, a savage, retrained only
by laws and a little education; but let Wfe
from these, delighting in war, in death &
all the horrid deeds of savage ferocity.
Say, ye casuists, what is man, this noblest
work of God, when honest ; but inflamed
by paflion, what is he but a beast of prey ?
A more ingenious animal indeed ; for the
beast has the teeth, the horns, and the
poisonous sting that nature gave him to
dellroy his adversary ; but man has im
proved upon the works of nature and in
vented numberlefg weapons of definition.
One part of men are forging bloody in- |
- Itrument, to flay another part, anda third,
more fortunate perhans, amiqMHHfclves

BALTIMORE, April 10.
Extract of a letter from the captain of an
American vefTel, to his owners in this
place, dated Falmouth, Jan. 8, 1794.
A report is current here, and gene
rally believed, that immediately after the
meeting of 'parliament, Great Britain
will declare war againll America. In
co.ilequeuce of the on
the 6th November, upwards pri
vateers have been fitted out, from the
different ports of this kingdom ; one of
which sent in here, a few days ago, the
ship Active, of Philadelphia, with a cargo I
valued at 50,0001. She is condemned &
to be fold for the benefit of the captors.
A war between America and England ap
pears certainâit is the common topic, &
ex peeled by every body. By the king's
proclamation we are liable to seizureâ
but as we have put in here in distress, I
prefums the rigor of the law will not be
enforced.
" This day failed from here, a large
fleet, under convoy, for the Baltic.. A
Spanish 74 gun ship, with 500,000 dol
lars on board, is now lying heie: it is
part of the cash intended for government,
on account oftheNootka-Sound business."

THE grand pi inciple ot Equality, if right
ly understood, is the orr t y baCi on which
universal juflice, (acred order, and perfect
freedom, can be firmly btrlt, and permanent
ly secured. The vewof it exhibited in this
eflay, at the fame time that it repre/6-s the
inj'nlence of office, the tyranny of pr=de, and
the outrages ot oppreiEon ; cnnfirn.f, m tl*
mod forcible manner, the neceffitv cf subor
dination, ai d the just demands of lawtu) au
thority. So far indeed, from looienirg the
bands of society, that it maintains inviolate,
every natural and every cSvil d-ftinflion,
draws ipore closely every focral tie, unites in
ooe harmonious and justly proportioned sys
tem, and brings men together on the even
ground of the inherent rights of human na
ture, of reciprocal obligation, and of a com
