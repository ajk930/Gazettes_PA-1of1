j>
[Concluded.]
The treaty of Paris in 1763 and the
treaty of commeice in 1786, both of
which confirmed the treaty of Ut?echt,
stipulated that the enemies of tlie two
powers, viz. France and Great Britain,
(hould not be allowed to fell their privet in
the forts of either party.
Were there any doubt remaining on
this head, the practice of France herfclf
would remove it. Her edi&s, forbidding
the sale of prizes in her ports, while in
a (tate of neutrality, by aiiy belligerent
power, and directing her vefTels of war to
carry their prizes into the ports of France
where they were fitted out, would fuffi
ciently evince her confirmation ot these
treaties. See Valin's commentaries on
the marine ordinances of France, 272,
2 77-
An argument has been attempted in
another place, to be deduced from the
convention with the Dutch, relative to the
fills prixes, and from the 2 J article of
our treaty with Fiance, which secures to
her the privileges of the mqjl favored na-'
tion.
To this several answers may be given,
1 ft. The Convention with the Dutch was
a special convention relating to a special
cafe, viz. to the then exilting war, in
which both Holland and the United States
were engaged, as co parties ; Hone of the
provisions of that convention can relate
to a cafe where the United States are at
peace. The circumstances of that con
vention being a separate instrument from
the treaty of commerce, tho' dated on the
fame day explains that it was intended for
a special and temporary object, and not
like the treaty of commerce meant to be
a permanent compact : The preamble re
cites that it is intended to establish some
uniform principles, with relation to prizes
made by vefiels of war upon their common
enemies,
2dly. The sth article of that conven
tion ftipuhates that the priz.es of either
party may be fold in their ports
as far as may be confident with the 22d ar
ticle of the treaty of commerce, which ar
ticle however provides that the treaty with
Holland (hall not in any manner derogate
from the 22d article of the treaty with
France ; now by that article in the French
tr a'y, the Dutch are expressly prohibi
ted from felling their prizes in our ports ;
if Holland then does-not now pofiefs the
right, how can France derive it through
Holland ?
3<Hy, The 2d article of our treaty
with France only stipulates that each par
ty enjoy all the privileges of the molt
favored nation, on allowing the fame
compensation, if the conceflion was condi
tional ; but France, as has been shewn,
cannot confidently with good faith and
an adheience to her treaties, grant us the
fame compensation in similar circumstan
ces ; (he would, theitfore not be entitled
to this privilege, granted to Holland on
terms of reciprocity, supposing the privi
lege still to exist.
It remains to consider this important
quedion on the ground of expediency.
Abandoning the idea of right,'is it
expedient and politic to permit the sale of
French prizes in the United States ?
In contemplating this point, the deter
mination ought not to be influenced by
any prepofleffions in favor of one or an
tipathies against another nation : the true
ground of national policy should be taken,&
therefult should be that which is molt con- I
fiftent with our national interest. That the
permission to France to fell her prizes in
our ports would be advantageous to that
nation, and inconvenient to her enemies,
will not be denied ; but it is the very cir
cumstance of its thus being advantageous
to one and inconvenient to others of the
belligerent powers, which makes it inex
pedient.
* Were we prepared and resolved to be
come a party in the war, prompted ei
ther by gratitude sot one, or resentment
against another, of the powers at war, it
would be proper that we Ihould at once
take our fide and pursue hostile steps; but
if the policy of the country still points to .
peace and invites to neutrality, it follows,
indispensably, that we must ftriaiy in
here to the line of neutrality. Tnere is
no intermediate station between peace and
.var. Whatever may have, been out legi
bility in icfpedl to injuries received, poli
cy has for the prefeTit didatcd to the go
vernment of ths United States a pacific
system, and as long as that system (hall
be the prevailing one, consistency requires
an adherence to the principles it incul
cates, The queflion then resolves itfclf
into this, is the voluntary permifiion to
one of the belligerent powers'to fell her
prizes in the ports of a neutral power,
while the fame privilege is withheld from
others, even our allies, a breach of neu
trality ? A recurrence to writers of au
thority, as well as the reason of th*
thing, will compel us to aiifwer in the
affirmative. Vattel, page a J s ' "33
long as a neutral nation Willies to enjoy
this situation with certainty, it ought to
(hew in every thing an exact impartiality
between those who are at war ; for if it
favors the one to the prejudice of the ot ki
ll caftnot complain when that other (hall
treat it as an adherent and afTociate of
the enemy, its neutrality would be a frau
dulent one of which no one would be the
dupe." Mr. JeJferfon, in the printed cor
respondence, page 60, speaking of the
fitting out privateers, fays, " Since we
are bound by treaty to refufe it to the
one party, and arc free to refufe it to the
othex, tve are bound by the laws of neu
trality to refufe it to that other." In page
67, he fays that the permission to fell pri
zes in neutral ports is unfounded in the
practice of France, and he believes of all
other nations.
It is certain that France has paffid fo
vere laws against it, and that were we now
at war with any Eutopean power arid
France neuter, we (hould not enjoy that
privilege in her ports. The question is
not confined to Great Britain and France,
and it is not enough to fay, " we have
received injuries from the former and be
nefits from the latter, and therefore we
(hould grant a special indulgence to one
to the detriment of the other." Other
nations aie seriously Jtffefted by the decisi
on. 'Spain, Holland, and Pruflia are co
parties in the war against France ; (there
is indeed an appearance of a withdrawing
of the latter, though not yet ascertained.)
We have no idea of going to waV with
the firft ; with the two last, we have trea
ties of amity and commerce ; it is not im
probable, should the war continue, that
Sweden may be implicated as one of the
combined powers ; with her sve have also
a treaty of amity and commerce. A
permission to France to fell her prizes will
be a special privilege for her benefit, to
the injury of Spain and Holland certain
ly, and probably Sweden. Should we
feel no peculiar partiality for Spain, yet it
ought not to be foigotten that fhc lent us
money during our war with England and
combined with France to aid us : Grati
tude (hould fuggelt a recollection of the
fervicesrenderedus by Holland, and (hould
forbid a departure from neutrality, which
would eflentially affect her intereils. In
our treaty with Holland, it is exprefled
" that there shall be a firm inviolable nnd
universal peace and sincere friendihip be
tween the two countries." Would it be
a sincere friendfhip on our part to facili
tate to their enemies the capture of their
veflels by permittiig the sale of them in
our ports ?
In regard to Great Britain, a negocia
tion is now depending for a redress of
our wrongs. Whether or not there was
fufficient cause of immediate war against
that notion, or whether it was wife in the
government to prefer the path of negotia
tion to that of hostility, arequeftions not
now to bedifcufled ; the path of negocia
tion has been entered, and ought not to
be deviated from till it has been fairly ex
plored. Would a departuie from the
line of neutrality, as it relates to that nati
on, be, under the present circumstances,
confident with found policy ? Undoubted
ly not. I would not furnifh her with even
this pretext for a refufal to do us justice ;
I would afford every aid, every chance for'
a fuccefsful negociation ; I would avoid
throwing any impediment whatever in its
way ; and having acted thus, (hould my
expeaations be disappointed, I (hall f ee l
myfelf juftified in exposing my country to
all the calamities of war, to endeavor to
extoit by force that which justice and mo
deration (hall have failed to obtain.
There are other considerations aritlng
out wi the question of expediency, which
claim some notice. The sale of prizes in
I
... " ' \ .
our poits will have an immediate tenden
cy to encreafe the number of privateers On
our coasts, to embarrass and diflrefs our
commerce, and to fofterthat spirit of pri
vateering among our own citizens, which,
at the fame time that it is a diredt violation
of neutrality, leads to the introdudSbn of
immoial habits. And heie I cannot for
bear once more quoting the former secre
tary of state who, in page 63 of the
printed correspOndence, fays, " Were the
merchant veflels coming for our produce
forbidden to have any arms for their de
fence, every adventurer who has a boat,
or money enough to buy one, would make
her a privateer ; our coasts would fwai m
with them, foreign vessels mull cease to
come, our commerce muji be Jupprejjtd, our
produce remain on our hands, or at least
that great portibn of it, which we have
not veflels to carry away, our ploughs muji
be laid aside, and agriculture fufpcndecl. j
This is a facrifiee 110 treaty could ever |
contemplate, and which we are not dis
posed to make out of mere com plaiiarice
to a falle definition of the term privateer."
The pernicious consequences above des
cribed would equally flow fiom the allow
ance to fell prizes. From a view there
fore of the whole fubjedt, it clearly results
that the sale of prizes is not stipulated by
the treaty; that if it were, it would be
null, as repugnant to prior treaties
and not reciprocal ; that it is unfounded
in the practice of France hrrfelf, and that
it is inexpedient, as diredlly contravening
the laws of neutrality, and as prejudici.il
to our commercial interests, and the mo
rals of our citizens-

ons were evidently predominate over the
reason which ought alone to preside in
their deliberatiqps. x
" The council, wholly composed of
men without knowledge and without ex
perience, paid no regard to these confeder
ations. In the fitting of the 17th M. D'-
Aranda insisted, with it ill more energy,
on the fubjedt which he had submitted to
them, and called upon them by every mo
tive dear to them as Spaniards, to pause
before they plunged their sovereign and
their country into inextricable ruin. This
liberty displeased the favorite, the duke
of Alcudia, who dictates to the council;
and two hours after the fitting, M. D'A
tanda received an order to depart forth
with for Jaen, a city in Andalusia. This
order was fignified to him by the govern
or of Aranjuez, who accompanied him for
some leagues on his journey.
" M. D'Aranda received this' letter de
cachet with the utmoll tranquility and
like a 1 man accustomed to such prtffents.
His preparations for departure were made
in halt an hour. He carries with him in
to his exile the certainty that events will
confirm his predictions. He has raised a
monument that will prove to posterity that
he was the only statesman in Spain, who
knew the true interests of his country in
the present crisis. His banishment is a
triumph for the tools of the favorite ; and
the ministers of the combined powers seem
also not a little pleased, at what they call,
his disgrace.
" General Riecardos died here on the
I9thinilant; the court appointed count
â¢sr?-" Eg,;-. '
O'Reilly to succeed him, but he also died
on his route t6 take Ihe command of the
army. In his room the court has appointed '
the count De L' Union, who at the fame
time was governor and captain general of"
Catalonia. He is a veiy young man, but
; it is ftid that he has' militarv talents- he
j Is a&ive, and very much beloved by' the
troops, particularly by the Cataloniana.
" It Is not thought that he will be soon "
able? to commence In's Operations, as the
number of lick (till continues to be from
16 to 18,000 men. It is thought the
carnpaign will open with the fuge of Puj.
e'erda, where it is not believed that the
French can hold out loriÂ£, .as the fortifica
tions are trilling. M. dc Lanc-ara is ex .
pe&fd to fail in tSe beginning of next

Parma, who is to embark at Leghorn."
LONDON, April 11.
The arte it of Danton aad his friends has
been long forefeen by those who knew his
eh a rafter. There is iio accusation aÂ«ainft
I him of counter-reov Attiomry plots ; but
bis corruptions have been eiioimotis. Bolh
he and La Croix have amafled an enor
: inoiis sims of trrafure by the mott abomi
nable means, while RobefpWire remains'
unimpeacbed as to the eleannefs of his
hands. This is the opinion of those who
: are the best acquaint d with the Itate of
| parties in France and this opinion, which
I 1S general, has earned Robeipierre thro'
with triumph in ail his meafuns.
He will now, it is saul propose his plzin
of government in which Religion wiii muke
a conilituent pait, fre ed from the ceremo
nies of eliabiilhment on the one hand, but
,equally removed from licentioufnefi on the
01 her. He has already given notice that
he has a p*oje6t of a plan to lay before the
alfemb'y. , â¢
All attempts to ftaive France are now
frtrfl rated, They are within a few weeks
of having a crop of potatoes fnfficient for
thendelves for the confurription of a year.
To reconcile the people to this food, and
to encourage their cultivation, apamphk-t
was circulated with great induftiv among
the farmersâthe leading points of which'
are, that corn is the food chosen bv ty
rant* and ftnpofc'dupon mankind, becanfe
they have it thereby in their power to
ilai ve nations at their pleasure. It re
quires hait the year's labor of man to p e
pare it; a thousand ciicnnftances mull con
cur to its maturity and to its converlion
into bread ; armies trample it under foot
âand it cannot be concealed under roof
trorn the ravages ol wa-.
But polices seem dellined to be the |
food of Republicans in the moment of Re
volution;' The fame tpot of earth th3t
with great labor, and with all the rifle of
bad seasons, would produce corn oi.ly for
the fubiiltance of one man, would without ' 1
hbrr comparatively,, and ftlmoll indepen
dent of seasons, produce potatoes for'ten
men.âThey require na mills to grind
themâno granaries to preserve themâ
they could not be tiodden down, like
fields of corn, by armies, and the moment
that they were dug out of the generous
earth, they were ready for the life of man.
This argument set forth with all the
flowery eloquence of the French fsJhool,
lias had its cfieft ; and we under/land that
every corrter of France is likely to be molt
plentifully fumilhed with this ufeful root.

Richard, a nationalTeprefentative, stat

~PHILADELPHI A,
JUNE 9Â«
This forenoon at 11 o'clock, the two llou
fts oi Congress "adjourned to die firlt Mon
day in NovcnVocr next âthen to meet in this
city.
FkOM jl CORUFSPONDFNT.
THE SESSION OF CONGRESS.
Two nttratfl our attention
to the history of the feffon of Congress jtlft
closed; a representation according to the enu
meration of the inhabitants, and the extra
ordinary events of foreign politics which
have greatly affected the sentiments and in
tcrcfts of the people, and the proceedings of
the Legislature. The long boStled triumph
of the murmunn;: and acctifim; party has
not happened. An equal reprcfemation of
the citizens has'not unraveled tlie systems of
the two former Legiflaturcs. ,No mighty
frauds hiA'e been exposed, no great offend
ers hive been brought to ftfaine or to justice.
Sc fir from it the malice of the faction has
k< p> a fact instead of a feafl. For instead of
freafury corruption, instead Of abuses in the
departments* a committee of the house
of Representatives after a molt accurate ex
amination have tinted in th?ir report an au
thentic and itnanfwerable refutation to the
whitWered fufpiciohs and bold lies of five
years. The eqnal reprcfentation of the peo
ple has given a new /auction to the eftabiifh*
Â«â¢<! lyffeir.s. The provision for the balances
du. to the creditor states, snd the auxiliary
fine's of new taxes indicate steadiness and
p rfeverance, which will fectire the general
interest of the people and the refpetflability
of the Legislature infinitely better than the
frothy novelties and pernicious changes
which some factious men had hoped to in
troduce. The new members have brought
their proportion of patriotifm,of attachment
to order and to the present government as
well as of good sense. After this if will be
rather bold, but not too bold for those who
have become by practice hardened in calum
ny, to fay, that the people are averse to, the
government arid its eltablifted fvltems. The
rdort to a committee for plans of finance
instead of calling upon the Treasury accord
ing to the existing law and former usage has
not produced any of the advantages nor
drawn after it the changes which
were predicted.
In (hort, it appears from the session that
the government and its meÂ«fures have the
popular fancftion and support. The aifls and
votes of the representatives of the people af
ford better proof that they have, than- the
newspaper squibs of a half dozen clamorous
malcontent* in eath of our large towns, that
they haw not. Yet it is to be expected, the
chroniclers of scandal will go on as before
to call themfclvcs /' he people.
If we attend to the measures of Congress,
we fhali fee one system in them all. A system
of peace. To make the chance of peace the
best possible, they have made preparation for
war. These fern words explain the history
of the lalt session. Those who like secret
hiltory will find abundant materials for their
curiosity.
1 he great aim of the party and the insi
dious measures they took to carry their point,
w .11 be known and understood. The steady
citizens who feel an interest in good order
will fee the extreme hazard of our peace and
honor, and will rejoice in the termination of
the session.Events may turn out unfavorable,
and war may ensue. But it will be a merited
praise even then of the government that they
have done all to avert the calamity, and much
perhaps enough, to prepare for it. The style
of debate has often' been too personal, and
lomfjtimes, tho' very seldom there has been
a grofsnefs and intemperance of language
which a deliberative body fhoulrl always
dili ountenance. But the state of affairs fur
nifhed some palliations, and we flatter our
selves in future to fee Congress quoted as a
pattern of temperate dignity and wisdom.
Says a Correfpomlent,
The Democratic Society resolve one thing,
the President of the United States resolves
anotherâA House divided against itfelf can
not standâOne cannot serve God and Mam
mon. If the Envoy of the President of the
United States should go to the Court of
London and demand indemnity for the sei
zure ot our vessels, and the Envoy from the
1 resident of the Demo Society should go
and fay we had rather not have indemnitv,
matters would really stand iu a quere pof
t)ure Lord Grenville would fay, gentlemen
do agree among yourselves. It is evidently
tue with of that party to prevent any allow
ance for our injuries. Why ? Take away
the complaints and what else have they to
Hand on ?

*
tations rtiade by the United States, Dc n
mark, Sweden, Genoa and the HanfWns,
to obtain the railing of the Embargo laid
on a,l foreign vefiels actually detained at
Bordeauxâ
Conlidering that the motives which
gave room for this Embargo, no longer
exilt ; and that it becomes the dignity
and justice of the Republic to grant fuf
fieient indemnities to the foreign proprie
tors of {hips, whose intereils have fuffcr
ed by the Embargo, and to facilitate ths
depaityre of their vesselsâ
The Committee of Public Safety, by
virtue of the powers delegated to them
by the Decree of the i 4 th I'nmaire, f2 t h
Uecember, j v r
Resolve as follows :
1. The Embargo laid upon all foreign
ships at Bordeaux, (hall be raised without
delay, and the Captains are at full liberty
to oepart, conforming themfclves never
thele.s to the laws and decrees relative to
the exportation of goods.
2. No foreign fliip that arrived at Bor
deaux before the 12th of Nivofe, (The
lit of January,) and detained in corife
cu r.ee of the Embargo, (hall pay any
ot tier duties than those that were exacted
from foreign vessels before that epoch.
3- The Captains or proprietors fnall
produce accounts of their expences, and
ot the indemnities they cki'rn, to the Ad
min, llrators of the navy; who are to for
ward them with their observations to the
Executive Council.
The Executive Council shall fix the
indemnity to be granted to the Captains
or proprietors which fhail be paid them,
or to their atrornies, upon the approved
ckcifion of the committee'of public falety.
4- Ihe Captains (hall be at liberty to
fret an export, on account of this indemni
ty, and without waiting for its fixation,
the necessary provisions for their return
voyages.
5. The committee of public fafety,
leave at the disposal of the Minillcr of
the navy the sum of Eight hundred thou
sand livres, to be advanced to tin; Cap
tains on account of their indemnities, ac
cording to their respective wants, to be
ve, ified by the Confnls of their nations.
s 6. The Minister of the navy, as soon
as he has ships of" war which lie can dis
pose of, is directed to escort beyond the
cape, filch ot the neutral vessels as are ex
posed to the depredations of the Barbary
privateers.
7. Ihe Minillcr of foreign affairs, is
to acquaint the different Governments it
concerns with this resolution, and the Mi
nister of the navy is to put it into execu
tion in the molt speedy manner polfible.

JOSEPH PRIESTLY, l. L. D. F. r . s .
Sir, 1
WE are appointed by the Democratic
Society of the city us New-York, a com
mittee to congratulate you on yotir arri
val in this country : And we feel the most
lively pleasure in bidding you a hearty
welcome to thele shores of Liberty and
Equality.
While the arm of Tyranny is extended
in most of the nations of the world, to
crush the spirit of liberty, and bind in
chains the bodies and minds of mtn, we
acknowledge, with ardent gratitude to the
great parent of the Univerl'e, our lingular
felicity in living in a land, where Reason
has fuccefsfully triumphed over the artifi
cial diitindtioiifi of European policy and
bigotry, and where the law equally pro
teds the virtuous citizen of every descrip
tion and persuasion.
On this occasion wc cannot but observe,
that we oneo eftccmed dtirfelves happy m !
the relation that fnbfiJlcd between us and
the government of Great Britainâfrit
t ie multiplied opprtfiions which charac
ter, /.e that government, excite in us the I
molt pfiinful fenfatigj;,s, and exhibit a fpec
,as iÂ« itfelf,"as diftonorable
to the Britlfti name.
Ihe governments of the old woiM
present to us one huge mal's of intrigue,
corruption', and defpotifniâ mod of them
a ;. e n Â°"' bafe 'y combined, to prevent the
eltabLlhment of .Liberty in France, and to
ettett the total deduction of the Rights
or Mart. Under these affldting circum
itaiices, we rejoice that America opens
her arms to receive, with fraternal affec
tion, the Friend of Liberty and Human
Happiness, and that here he may enjoy
the belt bieffings'of civilized society.
We sincerely Sympathize with you in
a'l that you have fuffered, and we con
iiuer the perfeewtion with whicTi you have
been pursued by a venal court, and an
imperious uncharitable priest-hood, as an
ilhiltrioiis proof 6f your personal merit,
and a biting reproach to that govern
ment, fiom the grasp of whose tyranny
you are so happily removed.
Accept, Sir, of the sincere and bed
wiihes oif the Society whom we repre
sent, for the continuance of your health,
a.id the inereafe of your individual and
domelHc hippinefs.
JAMES NICHOLSON, Prejident.
To the Members of the Democratic So
clety in New-York;
GE NTLEMEN,
VIEWING with the deepest concern,
as you do, the profpeft that is now exhi
bited in Europe, those troubles which are
the natural offspring of their forms of go
vernment, originating, indeed, inthe ("pi
nt of liberty, but gradually degenerating
into tyrannies, equally degrading to the
rulers and the ruled, I rejoice in finding an
afyium from persecution in a count y in
which tlufe abuies have come to a natural
termination, and produced another system
of liberty, founded on such wile principles;
as, I trull, will guard again It all future a-'
buses ; those artificial diftinftioHS in focie-.
ty ; from which they sprung, being com
pleately eradicated, that protection from
violence, which laws and government pro
mise in all countries, but which I have
not found in my own, 1 doubt not I (hall
find with you, though I cannot promise to
be a beiter iubjedt of this government, than,
my whole conduct will evince that I have
been to that of Great Britain.
Jultly, however, as I think I may com
plain of the treatment 1 have met with in
England, 1 sincerely wish her prosperity,
and from the good-will I bear both to that
country and this, I ardently wi(h, that all
former animosities may be fjrgotten, and
that a perpetual friendlhip may subsist be
tween them.
