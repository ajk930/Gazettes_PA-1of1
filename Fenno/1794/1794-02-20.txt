to prove the labor oljrtemen 10 be much more

Relative to the unfortunate attack tp

Mr. Fejjno,
WHILST the sons of pleasure, and
the devotees of Comus, triumph in the
victory which they have obtained over
the iriduftrious and serious part of the
community, with regard to Theatrical en
tei tainments, they ought to beware of
infniting the feelings of their mourning
fellow-citizens. There are many of this
description, who cannot forget those tre
mendous scenes of desolation and woe,
which were exhibited here a few months'
since ; whose hearts still bleed at the re
tolleftion of many dear and valuable
friends torn from their embrace, and the
pictures of distress which they daily saw ;
but which the gay and wealthy patrons of
pernicious amusements cannot realize, as
mod of them fled trembling, to a dittance.
Those children of misfortune have no*:!i(h for the artificial tragedies of the
flags, iince the afftAing and tragic::*
h:biiiou of Providence "i this city by the
flau glilcring angels of deft- notion ; their
tender fenlibilities are not in unison, with
the farcical humours of the stage; and they
feelafecrct horTor at thecallous diiVrgnrti
of their feltifh and trifling hrethteiH M
of them are the induiinouÂ« ikkir, who
fcave not the means of Hying from the din
gerof infeftir>rt,(hould a Itilential scourge
again chaltife lis for our fins and cfpecial
ly for our contempt of the late divine
judgement. They are a verv numerous
class of citizen-, and thev cannot but feel
indignation at the conduit of anTee'iing
men, who having provided the means, as
they suppose of retreat, in cafe of another
visit from the Peltilential fever next Sum
mer, are in the mean time, by their pro
fanenels, blasphemies, sensualities and dis
sipation* of various kinds, provoking the
wrath of Heaven, to humble the pride of
the city, and leave their brethren to
fuffer under the llroke, which in fiich cases
is always general. They are surprized at
the inconsistency of the wealthier citizens,
who tremble at every whisper of probable
danger, who appear to have provided the
means of escape, under the apprehension
of another judgment ; and vet, in the
mean while, are madly bent upon plcafures
which hnve been unanfwerablv proven to
be the deftru&ion of virtue and morals.â
It would therefore be prudent in those
who feel themselves in a disposition to in
dulge in ditfipstion at every hazard, to
beware of pushing their trinmph too far,
left they kindle a flame which will not be
cafy to extinguilh, and which may jJi ove
fatal to their schemes of pleasure.
People of real tale and sentiment are
not only disgusted at the filly encomiums
which are so indiscriminately publilhed
upon the ftage-conduftors lately arrived ;
but people who have fuffered the extreme
of misfortune, feel themf-lves irritated and
insulted, at the pains Tvh'ch are taken to
make an ostentatious display of feftivity
111 ciicumftantes like ours.
P. S. The players should be careful .not
to permit their juvenile and indiscreet
friends to be too lavish of encomiums upon
their ch;ira<s\er and performances, left it
Ihould induce a minute examination into
tluir merit, which might prove unfavora
ble to their cause. â  It will readily be
conceived, that filch a p::negyi!(l as the
author < f the remarks upon the actors in
the Gazette of Tuesday, is one who has
nevfcr known much of the world, or of
1 urr,r.n nature ; he would otherwise have
known, that artificial tones and gestures,
Sue, are fir from being unrivalled or ini
mitable. He would have expe&ed that
the public Wculd sneer, at hearing of one
being " unrivalled," a second " without a
competitor," and another, " eveiy thing
that one could wish." Above all, he
might have been sure of the broadest
l: ; '.i"h of ridicule at his nonsensical jargon
of NTifp -â having " th&rified the gods."
I wi(h Mr. â may not be thought next to
love electrified those who are sometimes
focliftily enough called goddefTes.
For th; G/izr i ts. of thi United'
Mi. Fenno,
It is often difficult to prove the designs
of i>nrty; it is however fair ground to
charge mcafurcs of the word tendency to
the word intentions. It is trying men by
their afrions, which are surer proofs than
those solemn words that ufuaSy preface
thi fouled Ichemes. Indeed such men u
sually have all their patriotism in their
months, while their hearts are full of all
manner of wickedness. On these princi
ples, the public has seen in a proper light
the war contrivances of a hired French
party in this oountry. The incendiaries
were supposed to fink under the weight
of public indignation, and the firebrands
and daggers were thought to have drop
ped from their hands. Mr. Bache's papar
is crowded with proof that this is not
true. Read the sensible and moded reso
lutions of the Democratic Society, and
r'oubt if you can, that they are vile. They
are either the work of a foreigner, or of
an American who has the heart of a rene
pado. â¢ Such fetitiments spring from a
bosom tl-T* is alien and hodile to the peace
and honor of this country. To comment
upon them iÂ« labor lod to him that reads
them. They speak as plain French as can
he written. It is the evil genius of a cer
tain diplomatic man of truth and decency
to do exrftly what he (hould not, to car
ry his points. He prints his inllruA.ions
to undeceive all his dupes, and to disarm
iii hia champions. By that act, he threw
diigrace, and what is attrayi worse for a
party, 1 ridictilc upon all the solemn and
circumftaritial falsehoods which impu
dence had piled up, like a rampart, for his
defence. He furnilhed. fails,and coming
horn an enemy, facts that lilenccd for a
time even the hired clamor of impudence.
On the authority of his own duc.iments,
the people now know that the vigilance
and firmnefs of their firft magistrate pre
vented the most pernicious Ichemes by nip
ping them in the bud. The iilgheft praiie
on the wisdom of the government, lelults
from the printed evidence of its disturber.
While the plot was ripening in darkness,
it turns out that more prudent lleps to
baffle it could not have been taken if the
whole had then been as well known as it is
at this day.
The resolutions alluded to very impru
dently censure measures and events which
are at this moment the fubjeft of exulta
tion with every true hearted American.
Our peace is the prize which the forefight
and firmnefs of the chief magistrate secur
ed to our nation. To arraign that conduct
is only to refrefh the sense of public gra
titude and approbation. We have little
to fear from incendiaries while their efforts
are thus directed more to insult than to
inflame the people.

CONSTANTINOPLE, Nov 10.
The Imperial Ruffian Ambaflador Lieu
tenant General Kutufow, made on the
7th in ft. his entry into this capital with
a splendor which surpassed even the me
morable entry of Prince Repnin.
Immediately after his arrival, the am
bassador manifefted his wiih to the Tur
kilh ministry, that the French, with the
three-coloured cockade, might not be met
with by the people in his suite, which
might produce disturbances. Orders were
given ill consequence, and many of the
French there were obliged to acknow
ledge Louis XVII. for their king, which
procured them the protection of the other
foreign ministers. Fanton, the key-bea
rer of the office of she French embafly,
put himfelf under the prote&ion of the
reis effendi, after having reGgned his of
fice.
CR[TO.
The French royalists there have appli

envoy from monsieur, regent of France :
but no resolution has yet been taken with
rcfpeft to such a measure.
YPRES, Nor. 27.
Poperingue at last is delivered from the
hands of the French, after having expe
rienced great ravages. The Audrians
took this town last night by assault, by
moon-light; 600 of the French were cut
to pieces ; the streets were strewed with
their dead. Fifty prisoners of them have
been conducted hither. We took from
them on this occasion four pieces of can
non of large caliber.
UPPER-RHINE, Nov. 12,
The aflemblage of a numerous body of
French in the mountains, againd the
troops under the Duke of Brunfwick, was
the cause of the interruption of the bom
bardment of Landau ; but at present they
are entirely driven back, and the Prus
sians are again before that town, at lead
6000 lhells were thrown into that fortrefs
during the present week.
The Austrian General, de Vina, with
a body of 10,000 troops, advanced about
8 leagues into the French territories, and
rendered himfelf matter of several places
on the frontiers of Provence.
WARSAW, Nov. 17,
In the fitting of the Diet of Grodno,
of the 6th inft. the following Ordinance
was ilfued:â
1 ft. The General of the Republic,

the entrance into the dominions of Poland
to no Frenchman, unlefa he bÂ« provided
with authentic certificate*, proving that
he il no Jacobin.
2d. All vagabond Frenchmen, having
no paflport, (hall be arrcfted.

ITALY, Nov. 5.
any torrefpondence with the Republicans
ot that country. AUthofe that ihall re
fill"* to take the above oath, ihall immedi
ately be forced to quit the territories ot
Poland; and those who in future (hall
transgress that oath, (hall be driven from
the territories of the Republic of Poland
and lose their honor, as well as their pro
perty ; and the latter ihall be contifcated
to the crown.
4th. The circulation of all new French
Books, and Journals, is prohibited; as
well as the publication of any other sedi
tious book, under penalty of fix thousand
florins,
A regulation, respecting Luxury, is
upon the carpet, and will be determined
on before the prorogation of the Diet,
which is to takp place on the 28th inft.
The houlhold of his Majesty is expect
ed to experience a limitation, the number
of chamberlains is to be reduced from
twelve to five.
The above ordinance against: the French
has been moved for, ever since the fecor.d
inft. by M. Myaczynflcy, Deputy of
Lublin to the Diet, and brother to the
General of that name lately beheaded by
the guillotine at Parisâbut the Diet came
to no resolution on that fubjeft, fintil in
vited to it by a note from the Ruffian
Ambassador, Count Sievers, dated the
9th instant.
EDINGHOVEN, Nov. 7.
The winter quarters of the Pruflians
have been determined upon ; the head
quarters will be at Pirmafens, and the
troops will be cantoned in the neighbour
hood at Winzeln, Rappertfwieller, Krop
pen, Peter/burgh, Claufen, Mawfweiler,
&c. &c.
BRUSSELS, Nov. 15.
The allied trops are at last preparing
to take their winter cantonments.
The grand Imperial army, under Prince
Cobourg, will enter into cantonments in
the neighbourhood of Le Quei'noi, Valen
ciennes and Conde, the head-quarters will
be in the latter fortrefs.
The English troops, under command
of the Duke of York, have already en
tered into cantonments, in the neighbor
hood of Tournay, in order to defend
that of our Frontiers, and the Dutch
troops, having advanced into the interior
part of Flanders, took up their canton,
ments in the Walloon country, having
their head-quarters at Nivelles.
VIENNA, Nov. 12
The commandant of this city has sent
a letter to all the commonalties and dif
tri&s, requesting them to treat the French
prisoners not as enemies, but men, and to
meliorate their fate by every means in their
power. "We will not (fays he) treat
our prisoners as the enemies treat our bre
thren in arms, as it is not in cruelty, but
bravery, that we wilh to surpass them."
MANHEIM, Nov. 17.
The bulletin of Gen. Wurmfer con
tains an official account of the surrender of
Fort Louis. The garrison, who arc pri
fdners of war, confills of 4000 men.â
There are no pieces of cannon in the for
trefs.
HAGUENAU, Nov. 12,
The unfortunate city of Stralburgh has
become a prey to carnage and plunder.â
The deputies of the Convention, under
the guile of Representatives of the people,
exercise their tyranny of so sanguinary a
nature, as the two lad centuries cannot
afford an example of. Under the pretext
of purging the city and army of all those
whom they deem counter-revolutionists,
individuals are put to death daily. They
have charged three members of the Jacobin
Society to distribute civic vouchers to all
those whom they consider {launch citizens;
and those who are unprovided with such
vouchers are banished; of the latter, 1300
have already been sent to Balfort All

RASTADT, Nov. 14.
Fort Louis surrendered yeftcrday
garrilon we imagine, are prisoners of war.
It consists of about 4000 or 5000 men,
300 of whom are cavalry. It is supposed
that in Fort Alsace and Fort Louis, there
are 120 pieces of cannon. The capture
of this place is very important for the al
lies, as it secures them winter-quarters,
and will enable them, if the patriots do
not defend their canjp at Cliarleroy, to
besiege Stialburgh.

The mail from Flanders brought us this
day intelligence from Paris as recent as
the 9th infl. Our cotemporarieshfive re
ceived no Paris papers of a later date than
the 7th.
This intelligence, which we have re
ceived thus fpeedily.informs us of the con
demnation of Madame du Barre ; the de
feat of the Royalists in an attempt upon
the city of Angers ; and the capture of
an English trnnfport belonging to Guern
sey.
Our Ofiend correspondent (late 3 that
the French have extremely harraiTed the
allies upon the frontiers of Flanders. Tiie
retaking of Poperingne, and recent ope
rations against other frontier places, seem
to encourage a supposition that the French
do not mean to go into winter quarters.
Sortie from Toulon,
General D .igomier writes on the ]ft
Dec. that on the joth Nov. the Engliih
made a vigorous sally. They hadalready
seized rhe advanced posts and had taken a
redoubt; but the French charged them
with fucli impetuosity that the enemy ev
ery wliere beaten, was forced to re-enter
Toulon, after the loss of above 1200 kil
led and wounded. Among the prifoneri
is General O'Hara, Commandant at Tou-
[Loud applauses.]
Dugemier adds, that a whole camp of
the enemy has been taken by the French
tents and baggage.
Certain information is received, that
since the battles between the duke of
. Brunfvvick and the French in Deux Porrts
Gen. Wurmfer had defeated the republi
can troops in three successive engagements
and has put the whole French army in Al
sace to the rout.
In the session of the National Conven
tion of the 29th Nov. the assembly receiv
ed with the utmost applause a denunciati
on against the Englilh nation by the admi
nistrators of the department of Gard.â
The infamous Pitt, as they term him,was
jJarticularly included in this denunciation,
the origin of which proceeded from the
mafTacre of 300 Frenchmen, who they
said, had been killed by the English at
Genoa. They infilled on the deflruÂ£lion
of London, and assured the convention
that they had only to decree it, and the
fans culottes would leap over the space
which separates the two countries, and
London would soon be no more. They
further requested that the name of English
should be proscribed in France, and the
moll barbarous name substituted for it, to
perpetuate the remembrance of the hor
rid mafTacre at Genoa.
The convention ordered it to be insert
ed in the bulletin with honorable mention
but ilTued no decree refpe&ingit.
By the fire at Mr. Woodfall's printing
office in Paternoster Row, the whole im

The Flanders mail of day brings
an account of a confideraole advantage
gained by the Prufiian general Count dtf
Kalkreuth on the 17th ult. On that day
thethe Count was 4 times attacked near Bif
ingen, "by 25,000 Sans (jullottes, but the
enemy were each time repulled, and left
about 1 coo men killed 011 the field of bat
tle.
On the 20th the French made a fifth
attack upon the Prussians, who repulfcd
them, and took 7 pieces of cannon.
On the 18th ultimo at day break, 'the
French made a general attack on general
Wurir.fer's position from the Rhine to
Hockfeuded. The conflict which wan
long and bloody, ended in the defeat of
the French, from whom 43 prisoners were
taken. The allies had 23 men and thir
teen horses killed, and 200 men and 62
horses wounded.
The French at the fame time attacked
the Co.ps of Conde, supported by the
battalion of Wallis, a divilion of Hussars
of Dedody, and another of the Imperial
dragoons. On this occasion they were
defeated, and left at least 1000 men dead
on the field of battle. The lolls on the
fide of the allies confided of 61 men and
18 horses killed, and 241 men and 4.5 hor
ses wounded. Unfortunately Major Fran

It was said at Guernsey, that the great

Feb. 17
To the Editor of the General Advertiser,
Sir,
IT would be worse than hypocrisy to Ihrink
from the attack of the redoubtable champion,
who wiflied to enter the lifts in your papers-
It would be ltarting at a shadow, which if
shunned might indicate fear, altho , it had not
fubftanee to create alarm. Liberal as this ir
ritable gentleman has been in his abuse, boun
tiful as he has fbewn himfelf in invedlive, his
impotent ravings {hall not draw me alidcÂ« om
the right I feel to give my opinion cn men
and things ; neither frail they deter me irom
pursuing him, thro' the maze of ablurdity
which his clouded imagination has created â
His signature is emblematical of himfelf;
for no one who has Uen his supposed prodigy
of genius, but will subscribe to the opinion,
that he is in his A. B. of republicanii'm, and
political knowledge, and that by the time he
progrefits further in the alphabet he will be
lei's confident, less dogmatical, and lcfs igno
rant.
It is not a little surprising that a man who
makes a boast of his wisdom, and a parade of
his knowledge, (hould have so far mifccnceiv
ed plain things as to fay, that " the President
is a Sovereign for the people"âThe sove
reignty for the people, or the representatives
of iheir sovereignty, are their legislators; the
President is merely the Executive of the will
of the sovereign ; if he was the sovereign
for them, he would be charged with the pow
er of making laws: for legifJation is an es
sential of sovereignty, and as the people dele
gate a portion oi their sovereignty? that bo
dy which has the legislative power is the
sovereign for themâThe President is limited
even in his executive functions ; for he can
not make appointments to office without the
consent of the SenateâThe declaration of
war and peace is an attribute of sovereignty,
and if A. R. does not know it, I will inform
him, that the conftituticn has vested this a<St
of sovereignty for the people in Congressâ
The executive of the United States is the re
presentative of the power, the legislative of
the will of the people âThe will is an ema
nation of the sovereign, but not the sovereign
itfelf, for this is an unalienable right of the
peopleâThe power is an emanation of the
will, for without the will, the body politic
could not a<flâThere may be will without a
power, but 110 power without a will; for if
the people will not a power, it cannot existâ
To suppose a sovereign is to suppose a will
and power, felf existent, and dependent on
themfclves ; it also supposes a superiority,
and to suppose a superior being to the people
themselves in a free government, is high trea
son against liberty. Toe man who can afiert
that the President is a sovereign for the peo
ple, must be willful, or ignorant; if willful,
he must wiih it, and to wish it, he must be
the friend of monarchy and the enemy of
republicanism ; it ignorant, he ought firft to
make himfelf acquainted with the Constitu
tion under which he lives, before he commits
his opinion ; for as much mifchief oft times
arifesfrom ignorance, as from deiign.
A. B. charges me with " ignorance," and
to gratify his wishes I will acknowledge it, if
he can point out a single instance of a " civil"
action having been cognizable by a grand jury.
Criminal process wasi slued against Du Plaine,
he was arretted by the Marihal of the Federal
Government, prosecuted by the Attorney of
the diftridt, and acquitted by a grand jury, tho'
previously sentenced by the Proclamation of
the President, revoking his exequatur âDu
Plaine was a citizen of the United States,
and as such was intitled to the prote&ion of
our laws, he had a common claim to a fair
and impartial trial; but the Proclamation
was a species of outlawry, which interdi&ed
him, before the tribunal of his country had
an opportunity to take cognizance of his of
fence. An individual in this city, has been
imprisoned for publiihing an opinion upon a
cause fubjudice, and if the law contemplates
this so great an offence in a private citizen,
how much greater must be the injury and in
justice, when to the publication of criminality
is annexed the influential name of the Presi
dent of the United States !
To leflen the decision of the grand jury in
Du F'Â» line's cafe, and to cover their opinion
with contempt, A. B. modestly aflerts, that
they were " ignorant," meaning, no doubt,
that everv person who dares to d'lflcnt from
the infallibility of his opinion, is a blockhead.
To sum up his idea of them, he ought to have
charged them with obfeurity of chara&er;
for it begins to be a falhienable opinidn with
certain gentlemen, that every man who is
va
not within the vortex of government, or its
fyllems is ebfeurg, and that every one who'
queftionsany of the governmental measures,
io either a beggar, an incendiary, a fool cr a
rascal. Thus far has our freedom already
proc ceded!
rejcHedâ
'Tie true, that the people and the govern
ment ought to be the faine, but it is no less
'â¢true, that they have not been the fame, that
they have fpokendiffcrentfentiments. Henfield
was declared guilty by the government, he
was acquitted by the people, Du Plaine was
declared a criminal by the government, and
was declared innocent by the people, docs it
appear, therefore, that the people and the go
vernment are the fame : It we take A. B's.
ideas as the standard of truth and judgment,
we must suppose that juries are not the
people, and that government alone is wife,
and all else is folly.
That A. B. is not under the influence of
Hamilton or Knox, or that he is not a depend
ant or expectant of the President, 1 have no
more reason for believing, than he has for
supposing me the creature of a French Mi
niiter, or the tool of a fa<Stion.âMen who
make such loud declarations in favor of their
own integrity and difintereilednefs beget luf
picion ; for the man of real virtue, never
makes it a fubjeft of public declaration âAs
a man ought to be moral, and ought to be
public spirited for his own fake; and as we
: nave reason to believe, that man to be a hy
pocrite, who boaits of his virtue, so we have
reason to conclude him to be a sycophant, who
vaunts of his independenceâlf to be of the
order of paper noblemen, is to be independ
ent, I have no claims to itâl have, neither
Gracc HUS,
have I ever had any expe&ations from go
vernment ; disappointment, therefore, cannot
be laid to my chargeâl am easy in my fili
ation, and neither the smiles nor frowns of
government lhall draw me from my duty.
As a freeman, I have a right to give my
sentiments on public men and public mea
sures, and as a freeman, I will aflfert it; and
altho* such sentiments should curdle the rich
stream of fubmiflicn, which flows in the veins
â of the idolater A. B. even this ftiall not ex
cite difmav. I have not, neither do I deny,
that the President has rendered important
services to our country ; but does this prove
that he cannot do wrong, that he is above
the lot of humanity, that we ought not to
challenge the exceptionable parts of his con
dud, or that we ought to prostrate ourfelvcs
in flavilh fubmiflion before him ? I repeat
that I am not his enemy, that I admire his
virtues; but I alio decl ire, that no admira-
tion of his character shall shadow the jull re
pugnance that every fr. eman ought to have,
when he fees his rights and security invaded
even in the person of another âTo a Hate of
debasement indeed have we arrived, if we are
not at liberty to point out exceptions, because
the general rule of his conduct has been good.
A. B. has dragged a Minister of the French
Republic, before an American tribunal âhe
has exerted all th force of his eloquence to
render him odious ; but in the extremity of
his zeal, he has defeated himfelf, by fubflitut-
ing abuse in the place of fa<sl and argnment.
The officer who is amenable to the people
of this country, he strives to cover with the
mantle of inviolability, and the officer who
is not responsible in any degree to us, he
rains vengeance and condemnation upon ;
but his hillings, like those of the harmless
black snake, indicate the will without the
power to injureâThe protection which is
a (Forded by the law of nations to foreign
Miniftcrs, has no consideration in the heated
mind of A. B. he is determined tÂ« revile, and
no obligation of truth or jullice, has power
to restrain him. âHe fays that he is neither a
(lave, nor a tyrant; for that "he has not
tamenefs for the one, nor power and influence,
nor congeniality enough with Gracchus, Ge
net, or hollow democrats of any party, for
the other"âl wiih he had given a better
proof of his afiertion ; âfor he has come in
such a questionable (hape, that he might be
spoken to, as the ghost of republicanism, or
a tool oÂ£ the Dey of Algiers.

" By a very Angular fatality, the Re

America, are the agents of the traitors
whom (he has punishedâThe brother-in

of the name of Genet, sent by Le Brun
and Briffot, with the charge of Plenipoten
tiary Agent, resides at Philadelphia, and
has faithfully fulfilled their designs and in
ftruftions. He has made use of the molt
unaccountable means to irritate the Aroe
l icam Government against us ; he affected
to speak without any pretence, in a mena
cing tone, and to make propofalsto that
government equally contrary to the interest
of both nations; he endeavoured to render
our principles fufpefled or formidable, by
exceeding them by the most ridiculous ap
plications. By a very remarkable contrast,
while those who had sent him to America,
persecuted at Paris, the popular Societies
dxnounced as Anarchilts the Jacobins,
courageously draggling again ft tyianny,
Cenet, at Philadelphia,made himfelf chief
of a club there, and never ceased to make
