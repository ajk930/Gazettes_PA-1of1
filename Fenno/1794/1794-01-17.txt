Thus Congress, whe 1 the guineas fled,
Put pap:r-money in their ftcad ;
And if it prov'd a kind of curse,
'Twas better doing so, than worseâ
For tho' qurfelves were cheated sure,
It help'd usi cheat the British more.
That fhcet contains in !imple rhime,
The news I've brought from time to time,
Since lad, with cap in hand, I came
Begging, for wijt J Jure not nam.' â
Give me that fome'iing if you please,
And you may read it at your ease.
Scarce had our good old friend, the Sun,
Drefs'd out in furrs, the year begun,
When lo ! beyond the Atlantic flood,
His course was ilain'd with faultlefs bloods
Hark f where from fcencs of death afar,
Red Faction blows the trump of warâ
Where milling mid the scenes of ftrife,
The Mountain whets the deathful knife,
And (talking o'er the carnag'd ground,
Stabs Freedom with a fatal woundâ
Lo Louis ! from the throne of state
By villains fentene'd, meets his fate.
See! loft to every sense of good,
And recking with their sovereign's blood,
His murderers aim the deadly dart,
At fair Antouietta'e heart.
Nojuftice binds the hell-hound crew,
Their fouls companion never knew,
But screams of anguifli on their ears,
Transcend themufic of the lpheres ;
While tun'd to sweet fymphonious swell,
Sounds the loan Tocsin's awful knell.
Next, in this all eventful year,
Flies from liis pod great Dumourier ;
And now the Frenchmen fay, he's fled
With ail their guilt upon his head,
So erll the Jews, o'erftock'd with evil,
To save themselves and cheat the devil,
Bound all their fins in solemn ltate,
Upon the scape-goat's lueklefs pate ;
Then bid the staggering creature Itray,
Where e'er his nose (liould lead the way.
But Satan was not such a coot,
To fell Judea for a goat.
But now a chain of despots bring
Their troops, to avenge poor Gallia's king;
That isâsince Louis' head is gone,
They tremble stoutly for their own.
Ah worthy George ! thy fighting sons,
Deal lustily inâsaving bones ;
Whene'er attack'd, without delay,
They raise the liege, and run away ;
While brave Adol, to fear a ft ranger,
Boldly approaches nigh to danger,
And scorns to yield, tlio' wotinded full
Three inches down lownrils his JltulL
Behold Marat, whose gtlilty hand,
Spread ruin o'er his native laudâ
WhofiTvoice with hoarse infernal yell,
Urg'd on to death his dogs of hell,
When ftretch'd the bloody streets along,
Promiscuous lay the flaughtej'd throngâ-
Arretted by the stroke of death,
To female vengeance yields his breath.
See lovely Corde, whose patriot eye,
Beheld bright Peace, her country flyâ
Saw Freedom into exile fled,
And jufticc bow her awful headâ-
With firm, intrepid, Roman foul,
Deride the Rabble's base controul,
Afeend tintncv'd the fcafFold-throne,
And dauntless fly to worlds unknown.
And now, to attack this happy land,
Hell musters out his favorite bandâ
His body guard for storm and wind,
The Gog and Magog of mankind.
Abui'd by England, France and Spain,
On eveiy quarter of the main,
To make our wretchedness complete,
The Algerines fend out their fleet;
Thus what the canker worm hath bit,
The palmer worm has come to eat.
Thy cajlt Columbia, once so snug,
Thro' cither head has got a plug,
And soon, this curst barbarian troop,
Will tap it under every hoop.
To escape Abdallah'e bloody host,
We'll quit the European coast,
Improve the firft propitious gale,
And towards Columbia stretch the fail ;
Where we (hall find a noisy throng,
Chanting the antifederal song.

In committee of the holt, on the report of
the Secretary of Stcte, mlariiie to the com
mercial intercourfc of tb'u country, 'with so-
reign mitiotu.
Sketch of Mr. Madison's observations in
reply to Mr. Smith,
Mr. Madilon said, he had hoped that
the gentleman up yellerday, would to-day
linve favored tlie commiltee with those ar
guments which the late hour yellerday,
preventedhimfrom bringing forward; how
ever, as this did not appear his intention,
he rose to make some remarks on the very
important fubjeft, now before the Legilla
ture.
The fubjeft before the committee, be
acknowledged, is of a commercial nature;
however, it will not be poliiblc, he con
ceived, to do jullice to it and to the in
tercfts of the United States without mak
ing some allusions to politics. The ques
tion as it at tirft presents itfelf is of a ge
neral nature ; the committer arc lb deter
mine how far if iÂ«theÂ»ntereft -of this coun
try, by commercial regulations, to vary
the Hate of commerce now cxiiting. He
declared himfelf a friend to free trade, and
give it as his Opinion, that it would be of
general advantage if, all commerce was
lice ; but to this rule there are, he con
ceived, exceptions. He inttanced the na
vigation ast of Great Britain as a proof of
the efTift of one exception on tbeprofpe
rity of national commerce. This ast, be
fore the present revolution of France, when
it produced its full efTeft, and because it
was not counter-balanced by a-y similar
acts on the part of rival nations, gave to
Great Britain eleven twelftlra of the (hip
ping employed in her tiade. The rapidity
with which it produced its effects was not
lei's remarkable, lie said, than the extent
of those effects.
The a<Â£t passed in 1660 ; the foreign
tonnage then employed in the British trade
v. .-.s to the British tonnage as one to four,
in 1719 it was reduced to as one to nine ;
in 1750 it was as one to twelve, and in
1774, it was reduced to less than as one
to twelve. There is another exception to
the advantages of a free trade, w here the
fraction of the country is such with ref
peft to another, that by duties on the
commodities of that other it (hall, not on
ly invigorate its own means of rivalfhip,
hat draw from that country the hands em
ployed in the production of those commo
dities. When an effect like this can be
produced it is so much clear gain, and is
confident with the general theory of nati
onal rights. What has been and ever will
be the effect of leaving our commerce alto
gether to regulate itfelf? It is to submit
it to be regulated by other nations. Sup
pofc, that this country had a commercial
intercourse with one nation only, and that
we should admit of a free trade, and that
nation procecdedon a monopolizing system,
would not that nation enjoy all the carrying
trade, and with it the maritime strength
it confers be heaped upon a rival! Then
just in the fame proportion to the freedom
we grant to the veflels of other nations
with us, and to the burdens other nations
iinpofe on ours, with them will be the
transfer of those maritime refourccs.
It had been remarked that this fubjeft
is not novel. It is as old as our nation, it
1 as been difcufied from our political birth,
and it liaÂ« exercised the thoughts and at
tention of reflecting persons ever fmce. In
1784 the States, at the recommendation
of Congress, granted for a limited time
certain powers to Coiiorefs, for the regu
lation of our common commercial intereils;
but thii was found ineffectual. The States
then, endeavored to attain this dcfireable
objift by concurrent regulations, which
originated with Mafachufetts, but inef
fectually also Out of this experience rose
the nicafurej that terminated in the exit
ing eliablifhment, with a riew to some per
manent regulations and the vindication of
our commercial rights. This was no more
an object of the eliablifhment of the pre
sent government by the people than it was
their film belief that some regulations on
this head would be one of the firft fruits
of its operations. An attempt was one
of the firft fruits of those operations in the
Hoi.fe, but this firft experiment expired
in tie Senate, and there it fell, not from
a dillike to the principle, but because a
better â¢ mode, it was thought, could be
devised than that proposed.
It vat alio urged, when the qucflion
wasfirft agitated, at New-York, that such
regulations then would not be well timed,
considering that the execution of the trea
ty with Great Britain was yet depending,
and that uegociations for a treaty of com
mei ce might soon be expected to be open
ed. It was thought by some, wife to wait
the event of thole ncgociations, that then
the Legillaturc might proceed on surer
ground, and ast more unanimously. We
have waited; the treaty is not executed,
and we may infer from the communications
of the executive that there is no negocia
tions depending that (houlil stop us. We
have tried to bring about such a negocia
tion, and we have failed ; we have gained
nothing from those nations with whom we
have no treaty, and if we have been favored
by one with whom we have a treaty, it is
no doubt upon the idea that the policy we
at present pursue is but of a temporary
nature. Having seen the end of what was
then pending, we are surely now free to
take such measures as a regard to our in
terest may dictate, and if we find that the
state of our commerce does, not comport
with that interest we are free, and bound
to vary it so as to make it contribute to
our welfare.
The propositions before the committee
fliould be examined as they concern our
navigation, our and the just
principles of discrimination that ought to
prevail in our policy to nations having trea
ties and not having treaties with us.
With refpeft to navigation it was con
ceded even by tile gentleman up yesterday
that our navigation is not upon the fame
footing by the regulations of the two na
tions with whom we have the greatest com
mercial intercourse. With refpeft to G.
Britain, while they carry their own, or
any other produce to any of our ports and
take our own produftious and that only to
part of her dominions ; in her Weft In
dies our velTcls are entirely excluded. The
gentleman from South Carolina, viewed
this part of the fubjeCl in a different point
of light than it struck him, he said. He
(Mr. Smith) considered it as a favour that
our produce (hould be admitted in the
British i (lands, when the fame articles of
the produce of other countries is positive
ly excluded. This exclusion, he answer
ed is merely a matter of form, it is of no
consequence as this is the only country
that can supply those articles; it is a pro
hibition that exists only upon paper but is
never called into exercise.
To exhibit at a glance the effect of the
Britiih navigation ast on our navigation
it is fufficient to compare the quantity of'
American and Britiih tonnage employed
in our intercourse with Great Britain ;
the former, in 1790, amounted to 43,000
tons while the latter was 211,000 tons. â
A change owing to a particular change of
circumstances hastaken place since that pe
riod in favor of the American ; but the
proportion in that year, as lei's influenced
by accident, may with more propriety be
taken for data. Further to shew the ef
fect of Britiih policy he compared the
proportions of the domestic tonnage em
ployed in our intercourse with other Eu
ropean nations, at that period. With
Spain the American was to the Spaniih
as sto I ; with Portugal 6, I ; Nether
lands ij, I ; Denmark 12, I ; France
5, 1 ; Great Britain I, 5. One obser
vation may be deduced from this view of
the fubjeft, that if if was the interest of
this country to extend its navigation as
far as it may be extended, by a transfer of
commercial advantages from Great Britain .
to France, it might be encreafed tenfold.
Gentlemen might wish to know the
proportion which American tonnage bears
to that of foreign nations founded on the
document of the late state of things intro
duced into the house yeilerday j he had
made a calculation on this basis and found
that, with Spain our tonnage is to the
Spanirti ns 16, I ; Portugal 17, i ; Ne
therlands 26, 1 ; Denmark 15, I ; Rus
sia 14, 1 ; France between 4 and J, 1 ;
and Great Britain 1, 3.
This exilting foliation of our commerce
is the more mortifying, when the nature;
and amount of our exports are considered.
Our exports are not only necessaries of life
or necessaries for mannfa&ures, and there
fore of life to the manufacturer, and thence
ought to command a good market where
received at all, but the bulkinefs of them
gives an advantage over the exports of e
very other country. If we chose to adopt
the principle of excluding other nations
from our foreign trade,in order to encreafe
our maritime ttrength, the nation might
secure the carriage of the whole of its ex
ports leaving to other nations the carriage
of theirs. Such a regulation would, to
be sure, be fubjeA to a very considerable
inconvenience, that of returning empty
from the markets to which we exported
our commodities, and therefore would o
perate as a considerable tax upon the in
tcrcourfe, but the leafoning does not lose
weight on this account, and if such a re
gulation was confined to Great Britain
this would be the effect, that Great Bri
tain,inftcad of employing in her commerce
with the United States 222,000 tons and
13320 seamen, oould employ only 66,000
tons and 3960 seamen, and we in our trade
with her, by the fame means, would raise
our number of tons to ij6,qoo and of
seamen to 9360,
He did nut suggest that it ever would
x neceflaryto carry matters to this length
but it was well to fliew how far we have
the right and power to extend our naviga
tion and maritime strength, which view of
tlie matter is a fufficient guarantee against
any inimical viewt which may be formed
to our disadvantage.

NATIONAL CONVENTION,
October 6.
Letter from Lucombe Saint Michel, Re
presentative to the People in Corsica,
to the President of the Convention.
Calvi, O(Sober 1.
" Citizen President, my letter of the
16th of September, informed you of the
answer which I gave to an English flag of
truce, which I refufed to receive. After
having cut off my communication by sea
with St. Florent and Baftia some English
vefTels gave the fame fummon3 to these two
cities. I know not what was the answer
of the officers who commanded there but I
flatter myfelf that it was Republican. The
English, after having examined Calvi and
St. Florent, being of opinion that the lat
ter place was more accefiible than the
former, was resolved to attack it. The
attack was concerted with Paoli, who had
come down from Corte to Murato, where,
as usual, he prudently kept at a diflance
from the fire. For two days, two vefTels
cannonaded the battery of Fornelli, in the
gulph of St. Florent; Leoneri, Ex-Le
gislator, commanded the land forces, and
had along with him four field pieces, which
the English had given him. The fire was
brisk : we have not, as far as lam inform
ed, loft one Frenchman ; the English ac
knowledged that they loft 17 men, and
had several wounded, among whom is a
Captain of a ship, and Mafferia, a friend
of Paoli, and of rank among the English.
A great storm having arisen during the
engagement, the English re-embarked j
they left the four field pieces Jb the Cor
ficans.âDuring the night, the French
made a sortie from Bornelli; they attack
ed and pursued the Corficana, and took
from them four pieces of cannon. On
the fame day the Corficans attacked St.
Florent, Patrimonio, Barbagio, and Fu
riani; they were every where repulsed
with loss.
" I received the details by way of the
interior and from confidential persons,
whom I had sent into Nebio. Stfch, Ci
tizen President, are the men who sent to
the bar of the Convention a Ferrandi, a
Conftantini, to declaim against me and my
colleagues ; and to protelt, that the rebel
lious Administration and Paoli wished to
be Frenchmen. I fend to the Committee
of Public Safety a very curious publica
tion. I expect, with impatience, the ap
proach of the English, and of the faithful
fubje&s of Pitfcal, the firft to Calvi. The
enemy know, without doubt, that the ar
tillery of the place is out of order [ but I
am there, and I am every day exercising
21 o cannoneers, who will do them more
mifchief than they are aware of. (Ap

The committee of public fafety present
ed a plan for lodging the young men in

Convention, that he had discovered in a
concealed place, twelve hundred mattraf
fes, twelve hundred coverlets and camp

" I make use of a bit of paper found in
the castle of the Duke of Wurtemberg, to
tell you, that his principality belongs now
to France. After having been informed
that the little Duke had furnifhed hit con
tingent to the allied armies, aud that his
children were in the' Emperor's it-nice, I
have this morning entered Mombeliard
with a battalion of Dole, Jo cavalry and
Tome small artillery. We took the city
without diSculty, nor was there a gun
fired.
" I have laid hold of all the ca(h. Hi

WINCHESTER, Jan. 6.
From the Knoxville Gazette of Dec. I.
Two Cherokee Indians, a fellow and a
fquavr, taken on the Tenneflee, by Capt.
Harrifon,in a late scout, have been brought
to this place ; they inform, that the town
on the south fide of Hightower River,
where a part of General Sevier's army had
the late combat, is the principal place of
rendezvous for the Creeks and Cherokees
to affcmbk, previous to their coming in
upon the frontiers; this town is princi
pally inhabited by Creeks, and is governed
by a Creek chief, called the Buffaloe-
Horn. Since Gencral'Sevier'sexpedition,
the Indians have done but very little mif
chief on the frontiers of this diftrift ; they
have stolen a number of horses and cattle
from the out settlements, and some small
trails have been seen in different places.
On Monday lalt Nicholas Ball (palling
from Golliber's creek to Wells's station, in
Knox county) was fired on by five Indians,
and received three bullets through his
clothes. In the action which Captain
Evans had at Hightower, Mr. Ball had
two bullets (hot through his hat.

SIR,
" Some horse's having been stolen, and
Indians seen in this neighborhood, I or
dered our Lieut. Snoddy, with thirty men,
to scout the woods about the Caney Folk,
and, if poftible, discover their main en
campment.
" On the 4th inft. be met two, who
fled, and he pursued to a large camp near
the Rock Ifiand Ford of the Caney Fork
where he took 28 good Spanish blankets,
two matchcoats, eight new brass kettle'
one fire-lock, three new swords, SpanilhbWes, a bag of vermillion, powder and
lead, several bayonets, spears, war-hatchets,
bridles and halters. Evening coming on,
withdrew from the camp, about a mile,
to an eminence, where he halted his men,
and laid on their arms all night. About
the dawn of day they appeared advancing,
with trailed arms, and at about thirty
yards distance a firing commenced, and was
kept up, frcm three to fom rounds, when
the Indians retreated, leaving one fellow
on the ground, and were seen to bear off
several wounded. JLieuteuant Snoddv had
two men killed, and three wounded, it is
hoped not mortally. Such couduft and
bravtrv would do honor to veteran troops.

ExtraA of a letter from a gentleman in

dated Oflober 29.
" I have this instant received a letter
from our friend P. H. now in Toulon,
with a cargo of grain from Baltimore ;
he mentions that the Spaniards have been
completely defeated in feveial engage
ments, and are running out of France,
fafter than they came in j that the French
are every where vi&orious, and that the
National Convention sent orders to the
different armies, to be before Toulon by
the fiift of November ; that they may be
fuccefsful is my sincere wish, and that of
every true son of Liberty. That the com
bined arrives have been defeated is true,
but kept from being made pubh'c for fear
of disheartening the, troops, and of en
couraging those who are dilaffedted to the
British government.
" I must now inform you how matters
stand in this country. In several counties
the people have rose up againit govern
ment, with the cry ofâNo War ! The
militia have been called out, which has
exasperated the people so much, that they
have come to a resolution not to give up,
until they receive a redress of grievances
and no war ; I a fibre you, my friend, it is
really alarmuig and (hould France invade
this country as they have threatened to
do, they will find that a majority of the
people will flock to their standard ; ihould
parliament not make some very great
concessions soon to appease the people,
the event will be the downfall of monar
chy in Great Btitain. The truth of the
above, I will answer for, and you have
my leave to make it as public as possible."
I am your friend and
humble servant,
Events of the above nature may jujl as
easily be kept secret, as a great Jire in a po

" The Allied Powers fay, the French

and many honest men Then let them
aloneâlet them cut one another's throats
till thev are sick of itâby opposing them,
you irritate them, excite treason in the

and make them ten times more cruel.
" But their principles are dangerous,
subversive of all order, religion and mo

were never yet fupprejfed by force ; on the
other hand, opposition always spreads them.
You provoke enquiry, investigation, curi

FROM A CORRESPONDENT.
The practice of private persons andfelf
created clubs, oflei'iiig addrefies to foreign
ministers is a very pretty one. It gives
room for a minister who abhors the mvfte
ry and foppery of courts to pradtife in
cabinets affairsâthat is to fay, as the
faihion now (lands in the out of dcor-buii
nefs, the candor and franknefs he so much
admires. The dangerous damps and va
pors of intrigue are difiipated, when the
tali is held and belts and wampum exchan
ged in the open h'ght and air. Foreign
ers when they rca4Â«ji?- newspapers will be
confirmed in their <?d belief, that we are
half Indiansâthat our tribes meet under
the trees and receive presents from foreign
envoyS, and smoke with them the pipe of
peace. Several of our Jacobins promise
as much loyalty to France, as the Long-
Illand and Genefee tribes profefs to the
State of New-York.âWill they not fay,
those wild Arab* of the American woods
have no regular government, because it is
plain theynegotiatewithoutany: Eachman
appearing in his own person according to
the state of nature, to hear what an envoy
has to fay. It is aifo plain fay they, that
these Arabs are not Independent in their
government, because they are obliged to
profefs to this foreign agent, more refpeft
and affection for his government than for
their own. .
COMMUNICATION.
It seems the report, " of Citizen Genet'i
having attempted to raise an army of 5000
Americans at South-Carolina," (Hie a for
mer report) turns out to be something like
a lie ! It is, therefore, rather to be regretted,
tnat a certificate was not obtained upon the
occasion from the chief-juftice of South-Ca
rolina, -which might have been here recorded,
with a former one.

the criminal may dieâis it not enough that he

Why then Jhould a defencelefsfemale,on whom

The aiticlc in the French langii?
which accompanied tlie meflage 01 (
Prelidcut of the United States nccivn)
yesterday, is a navigation ast pafied l>y
the National Convention the 271)1 Septem
ber last.
A memorial was read From A. G.
1' rauiiciÃ, praying for a copy of the report
on his petiu d, &c. laid 011 the table.
After reading and rjfering fotne Qthdr
petitions, the hoiife went into committee
of tlit; whole, on the appropriation billâ
Mr. Trumbull in the chair.
The committee proceeded in the dif
cufiioif, during which, Mr. Baldwin rofi
repeatedly, for the purpose of enquiring
into the excess of Â»ai ious funis appropri
ated for contingencies and other purposes,
above the sums heretofore appropriatedâ
his object was, tiiat a committee lhouic be
appointed to make particular enquiry into
the reasons of theie excefies, and to ic
port. A motion was at length nude
and carriud, for the rising of the commit
tee. In the house Mr. Baldwin r ..1..: a
motion for the appointment of a fpccial
â¢ommittce, to enquire into the cause of,
and report on the expediency of these cx
ceffcsâThis irhotion was agieed to, and a
committee of five appointed.
The House took. into consideration the
report of the Secretary o' the Treafurv 011
the memorial of Daniel Parkerâthe Ij'j
itance of the report is, that it may lie for
the interest of the United States, ty com
pound the debt due from the mcmoriaiitt,
and suggests the expediency of veiling a
power foniewhere to make the competi
tion.
It was moved that a committee flicul \
be appointed to prepare and report a bi.'l
pursuant to the report of the Secretary of
the XYeafuryâfome debate ensued on tliit
motion, it was opposed on the score of
precedentâand that it might be better tor
the United States to loie the debt, than
to eflablifh a precedent which might open
a door to every delinquent debtor of the
United States.âlf the mtmorialilt is an
honest and has any property, he
will throw himfelf on the justice and hu
manity of his country. âThe coudiufi of
the petitioner in withdrawing from his
country, and his consequent deportment
were reprobated.
In support of the motion, it was said,
that the only qucftion was, whether the
United States would insist on receiving the
whole oT their demand, and get noth; :/â¢>*Â«
or compromise their demand and receive?
something.
1 his it was fa id, was not establishing a
precedent ; it was simply fallowing the
custom established in all hmilar cases by in
dividualsâit was true that public bodies
adopt generally a more rigid line of ccn
du&, and perhaps with propriety in moik
casesâbut in the present mftance the me
morialist is out of the country, out of the
reach of the laws ; he is able to pay
something-, but is not willing to be diver
ted of all bis propey, y and be Hill bound
to discharge a balance he never can pay*
Mr. Nicholas proposed the folkwinÂ£
motion as a substitute for the ftril tWAtioc,
âthat a committee be appointed to en
qure whether D. Parker and Co. any
equitable or other claims to a rt<littion of
the balances which appear agavirft them,
on the books of the tteafury of fh'. Â£' ,'u
ted States, and report fpeeially thereon
to the house.
This motk>n after some further debate
was agreed to, and a committee of three
appointed*
It was then voted thai the House pro
ceed to the coafideration of the report of
the feleft committee on the memorial of
Andrew G. Frauncisâfeme convcrfstiou
epfued refpe&iftg the discussion of this re
port with open galleries, on account of a
communication of a confidential nature,
made to the feleft committee-âTThe rule
of the House, the SpeiJcer observed, re
quired that the queltion fcr closing the
galleries (hould be privately difcufled, on
which it was ordered that they (houid be
cleared.

As a number of families are still in the
country, and it is not generally known who
arereturned. T. Dobfon, foKcits the favor
o* the fubferibers to call or fend for their vo
lumes, that they may be supplied as early as
poflible.
The tenth volume of the Encyclopedia is
now presented to the public ; but as it makes
its appearance in an impcrfed state, forae ac
count of the reason of that iinperfeftion ftiould
be liven. On the Bfh of September last, the
Publiftier had the misfortune of having his
Printing Office burnt down by a fire which
broke out in the neighbourhood, and a great
quantity of his printing materials destroyed,
and among other articles, the figures, with
which he was printing the tables op lo
garithms, l>e ; Â»ng ng to the present volume,
were melted down by the violence of tlwfire.
As a fupiily of these could not be immediately
obtained, he was under the neceflity of pub
liihing the volume without the e ta;les; but
hoj>es he (hall be able to publish them with the
next volume which is now in coniiderable for-
w .i dnefs.
The Publisher embraces this opportunity of
expressing his grateful acknowledgments tÂ«
the generous pubi c, for the very liberal pa
tronage with which his undertaking has been
honored; at the fame time he takes the li
berty of reprefenti igto such of the fubferibers
as are in arrears, the indifpenfible neceflity of
punctuality, both in taking up he volumes as
early as poflib'e after publication, and of pay_
ing for them when taken. Many of the fub
feribers having got only one, two, three, &c.
volumes, a:Â»d several volumes remain unpaid.
Thus the work hangs in all its differentftages
from the commencement; and though tw im
portance of a few dollars may be but a trifle
to the individuals, yet the accumulation of
these trifles unpaid lays the Publisher ander
very serious embarraflment, and deprives him
of the ufc of many Tlu>ufÂ«ndsÂ»f Dollars which
at this time would be of very efTential ferrice.
For tbefe reasons the Publi(her finds hrmfelf
under the neceflity of recurrirg to the or ; gina|
terms of publication, and in future no vo
lumes will be delivered but only to those who
take and pay to the time of publication.
