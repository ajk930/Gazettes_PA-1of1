Frim thj Virginia Gjzellr.
VIRGINIA, hail, thy pfaife demands my
'ong,
I sing thy Patriots, Â»nd I do them wrong:
You boast another rice, of godlike men,
Whose eulogy requires a nobler pen,
But to my native impulse ever true,
1 honor merit, and I honor you,
Should you great Madison, approve my
strain,
At leall my labour will not be in vain ;
For worth like thine, One honest with re-
ccive,
Tis all the Muse, and all the friend can give*
May you the best reward that Heaven can
fend,
Long serve your country, ever 'oe her friend,
True to her irtterefts, and the Rights of
Man,
Anxious to do her all the good you can.
Go on immortal Man, the pith pursue,
Mark'doutby Heaven, and deftiited but for
yQU;
Millions unborn with gratitude (hall raifc
To thee a monument of lading praise,
Succeeding ages shall revere thy name,
And pratling rftiants leam to lisp thy fame.
Go on great Giles, nor venal mifcreantt
heed,
Yotlr cause is Freedom'*, and ySVi must suc
ceed,
The real Republicans throughout our land,
Shall hail you as their guardian and their
friettd,
While G ~ D , DâS , and
A ,
Shall be defpis'd, detested, hated names.
Thee too, bold Nicholas, I fee thee
there,
Thy Country's sacred intirefts all thy care!
Prince Edward's Hero,* joins the no
ble train,
And fa-ears the Rights of Freemen to main
tain.
See Britain (hake, her Agents fneakaway,
While'men like these Columbia's sceptre
sway.
Qh, Massachusetts, once my boast
and pride,
The nurse of Heroes, and the Patriot's guide
How haft thoil fallen, all thy glory loft,
Damn'd by a speculating, ftoek-jobbing hofl.
Wretches, who made immortal by their
crimes,
Shall live to infamy, thro' fiiture times,
Ages to come ihall their vile actions know,
While Plwtus welcomes to the realms be
low.
PLyTus, the only God whom they adore,
Give them but gold enough, they aflt no
more;
Not such thy Patriots, of oldfeventy-five,
Not fucji thy Hancock, much lov'd (hade
forgive;
Forgive, great Adams (names to Freedom
dear)
The Muse who darÂ«s to introduce you here.
Virtues like yours, my feeble powers mfpirej
My bosom burns with patriotic fire.
O, would to Heaven, that my weak word*
might fh'ove,
And route the People whom I dearly love,
To their true interests, open all their eyes,
And bid their ancient, noble ardour rife.
Bid them despise the (peculating race)
And choose new characters, to fill their pjac(i
Men not for riches, but for worth approv'd,
Who love their Couutry, by their Country
lov'd,
Whose services, yet may prop their finking
Hate,
And lave front ruin, ere if be too late.

Last night difpatclies were received
from the head-quarters of his Royal High
ness tbc Duke of York, dated the 13th
in Hani. The army under the command
of his royal highness, was upen the point
of marching to Ghent, its appointed win
ter quarters.
By the Dutch Mail which came in last
night, we had no further accounts of the
bloody ast ion fopght between the duke of
Brunfwick and the French on the ift inft.
Although the Republicans were driven
back with great loss on the firft, yet they
returned to the attack on the second. It
was on this occasion, that in the army of
Wurmfer, General Keglewich was Ihot,
and the duke of Bourbon wounded in the
Hand. The corps of the prince de Conde
was principally engaged in this aiftion.
On the 4th the French made a fre(h
attack, in which they were also repulsed.
The accounts from the army of the
duke of Brunfwick, state, that the French
have evacuated Bliefcaftcl, and retreated
to S'aarbruck.

EtctraH of a letter from Paris, Nov. 23.
" 1 wi(h the English knew the real state
of France, they would then be convinced
that though they may ruin themselves,
they will never be able to subdue the spirit
which is now afloat in this country. A
njw species of fanaticifm fires everv ima
gination and invigorates every man. There
are ni'.ie hundred thousand men a&uallv
jn arms, 1 ' and the whole kiogdbm 'is noit
become a military (chool.
The treasury overflows with money,
and Ihoulcf it be exhausted, the rich will
be forced to produce every farthing they
pafieis, for this is the day of triumph to
the poor. Of the prefcnt government I
will not speak, there can be but one opini
on of it: yet were the Englilh to make
peace, it mull change, and the hand of
death would be flopped within as well as
without. I repeat it, my friend, all Eu
rope, 1 have not learned to talk big here,
will only render the enthusiasm more warm
that carries every thing before it. Should
the war continue, it will furnilli a fre(h
pretext, plausible reasons to gloss every
tyranny, but it will never restore Monar
chy." '

MADRAS, August 24.
WE lose not a moment in communi
cating to the Public the important and
inteiefting intelligence we hare just re
ceived of the Surrender of the Garrison
of Pondicherry to the British Army, un
der the command of Colonel Brathwaite.
Our fourteen gun Battery to the north
ward was opened at 7 o'clock on the
morning of tire 2 2d, and in less than two
hours the North, and North-East angles
of the Fort were Completely silenced. The
enemy being obliged to ma(k every era
brafureâAt noon the mortar battery was
opened with so much judgment and elFeft,
that the deftruftion mult have been very
considerable, for at 4 o'clock P. M. flags
of truce were displayed" from all pans of
the Fort; and about j the Lieutenant
Colonel of the French troops, with the
town Major were eonda&cd to head-quar
ters, deputed by the garrison to requeti
that no further approaches, (hould be car
ried on, and that a ceflation of arms might
take place for 24 hours. The Commander
in Chief poiitively refufed the firft part of
the fequifition ; but agreed to suspend
hoftflities until 8 o'clock the following
morning; at which time the surrender
took place, and the Colonels Floyd and
Maxwell, were dire&ed to take pofleffioÃ
of the Tort. â  â¢
The prirate property of individuals i*
secured, the French officers to be on their
parole, but the troops not permitted to
march out with the honors of war.
Circumllanced as they were, the terms
of capitulation evince the moderation and
forbearance of the captors ; âand the af
ter orders of the Commander in Chief are
fa exprefilve of the urbanity and genero
sity which have ever been the leading fea
tures in the British chara&er that we have
a peculiar fatisfa&ion in having an oppor
tunity of laying them before our readers.
GENERAL ORDERS.
Pondicherry, 23d August, 1793
Colonel Brathwaite hag the honor and
happiness to announce to the gallant army
under his command the news of the sur
render of Pondicherry, on terms dictated
by himlelf. Terms which he flatters him
felf mud ever remain as a memorial to the
French Nation that no superiority of force,
no advantage of circumstances, no mifcon
duft of an enemy will cause a Britilh eom
mander to deviate from that humanity
which is the diftinguiflied chara&eriftic
of a brave nation. He has spared the whole
of the property of individuals which the
rigid laws of arms would have juftified
him in treating otherwise. He has spared
an enemy that continued to ast offeniively
and definitively while unmoleftcd, but
who funk under the firft impression of hit
superior force, afkuated by the fame sen
timents he has no doubt but the whole
army under his Command will consider
these infatuated and unfortunate prisoners
entitled to their moll humane attention.
It is not neceflary for him at this time
to give so eminently distinguished an ar
my any orders on this head. The Gene
rals under whom they have served have
taught them that an enemy conquered iÂ»
an enemy no moreâand he is convinced
that the Britilh troops about to garrison
Pondicherry, as conquerors, and about
to take charge of French prisoners, will
convince both them and the inhabitants
that they can be as orderly, generous, and
humane, in the discharge of those duties,
as they have been aitifc and brave in the
duties of the trenches.
To a chearful, unanimous and zealous
perfeverance in their several duties, and to
their established chara&er for Bravery,
mull be attributed the success of the pre
sent dayâand their Commander will ever
remember it with pleasure and gratitude.
To thank corps or individuals in an ar
my so fully entitled to his warmed thanks
and approbation, cannot be attempted.
He thanks and approves the whole with
all his heart; and will not fail to speak
these his sentiments to his superiors.
By the Swallow Packet and Scorpion
Cruizer, just artived, we learn that Ge
neral Sir Robert Abercrombie and his
suite, who embarked on the former veflel
from Bombay on the Bth instant, had been

City-Hall, March Bth, 1794.
At a meeting of the citizens of Philadel
phia, the inhabitants of the Norther*
Liberties, and the diftrid of Soulh
wark, called by public advertisement,
to receive the report of the committee
appointed the 14th September last, to
alleviate the fufferings of their fellow
citizens, laboring under the affiidting
sickness which then prevailed.
The Hon. Thomas M'Kean, Esq.
Chairman.
Anthony-Morris, Esq. Secretary.
The report of the committee wasmade
and read as followsâand also the follow
ing particular statement of donations and
diiburfementsâthe vouchers in fuppont of
which were productd.
Having been appointed a Committee
on the 14th of September lait, at a meet
ing of the citizens, called by the Mayor,
of alleviating the fufFerings
of our fellow citizens, who were laboring
under the affixing sickness which thenjrrrvaifcd ; we have requeftei! your at
tendance, in order briefly to report to you
out proceedings ; referring you for more
particular information to our minutej,
which are in the press, and to our accounts,
now produced for your infps&ios.
Upon entering on the duties of our
appointment, we found many families of
the poor struggling under disease and
want. And that the house of William
Hamilton, at Bulh-Hill, which had been
taken poffeflion of and converted into an
Hospital, for their accommodation,' con
tained several sick persons in a deplorable
situation. Two of Our members offered
their service to superintend that instituti
on, they were appointed managers there
of and by their exertion and attention it
was condufled with order and regularity.
About one thaufand persons were removsd
to it, in carriages provided for the purpose,
and supplied with every requisite, to ren
der them comfortable, that the exigency
cf the times and our own situation would
admit.
Notwithstanding the great mortality
which prevailed there, wo think ourselves
warranted in the belief, that much distress
was prevented and the fufferings of many
greatly alleviated. We cannot with pro
priety omit informing you, that the ten
demefs and care exercised by Mary Savill,
the matron of the Hospital, to the Cck,
were such as entitle her to your generous
notice.
The extreme distress to which many fa
milies were reduced, rendering it impofli
ble for them to procure the interment of
their deceased connexions, it became one
of our mod pressing duties to provide for
the burial of such persons, and theiefore
we procured coffins and carriages, and em
ployed suitable persons to attend to this
mournful part of the service.
In the progress of the disease, many
children were bereft of their parents, and
the general distress preventing individuals
from attending to their exposed situations,
we were impelled to take charge of such
orphans, and of course it became necessa
ry to provide a suitable house, with a ma
tron and attendants and a number of wet
nurses. This was done and the whole
placed under the direction of four of our
members, especially appointed for the
purpose; of one hundredand ninety-two of
these helpless innocents; who came under
our care, ninety-four have been reclaimed
by their friends, twenty-seven have died,
and seventy one yet remain ; on whose
behalf we have applied to the legislature,
but as they have not cdme to a determina
tion on our application, we therefore ear
nestly recommend these orphans to your
immediate attention.
The calamitous state of the city caused
an unusual stagnation of business, and in
creased the number of the indigent so
much, that in order to obtain a knowledge
of their real situation and guard against
imposition, in relieving their wants, we
found it neceflary to call for Quittance ;
when a number of refpeftable inhabitants
of the city and suburbs came forward to
our aid, under the title of the Assistant
Committee, who rendered very essential
service by recommending suitable objects;
which facilitated the distribution of mo
ney, provisions and firewood, from the
14th October to the 23d November, to
upwards of one thousand families weekly.
Tliefe different opeiations requiring
considerable funds, and the major part of
the overlcers of the poor, as well as most
of the officers of government and police
being removed ; resource was had to the
President and Directors of the Bank of
North America, who cheerfully accom
modated us with [fx thousand five hundred
dollars; which we have been enabled to
tepay by the subsequent liberality of our
fellow citizens of this and other dates,
whose donations to us have amounted to
twenty nine thousand and eighty nine dol
lars 77- 1 ooths, besides which we have re
ceived 5316 dollars, 32 cents, for sun
dries mentioned in our accounts; which
sums fall (hort of that expended by us,
three thousand five hundred and forty five
dollars 12-1 oaths.
The mode of supplying this deficiency
you will doubtless conceive to be a part
of the business of the present meeting.
As no public provision is made in cafe
we ftiould be visited with a similar afflic
tion (to which all great commercial cities
are ejcppfed) it was deemed eflential, af
ter compenlating the proprietor of Bush-
Hill for the use made of his property, to
secure a resort to it again, (hoirtd it be
found necessary, before the 25 th of March
*795 5 'his was done and it- is still in our
pofTefiioÃâwbertin art deposited such ar
ticles as remain on hand bdonging to the
hospitaL The appropriation of these ar
ticles is an objcÂ£t which will claim your
attention.
The confederation of the propriety of
eflablithing a hospital in the neighbour
hood of this city, for persons afflicted
with infe&ioui diseases, which at the time
of appointment was referred to us, Would
have claimed our more particular atten
tion, had not the fubjeft through the re
commendation of the Governor been ta
ken up by the Legislature.
We think it proper to inform you, that
on the 13th of Odtober, a number of
sick and wounded Frenchmen arrived here,
on board the Ship Citizen of Marseilles,
from the hospital of Cape Francois;â
which alarming the inhabitants, we at
the pressing solicitation of the French Le
gation, and to dispel the public fears, ad
mitted these diseased strangers into part
of the buildings at Bush-Hill, the ex
pences, which occurred, have been reim
bursed. Â» >
Although we have to lament the loss
of Andrew Adgate, Jonathan 'I). Ser
geant, Jofcph Injkecp, and Daniel Offtfy,
four of our members, who, faithful to
the trust rtpofed in them, perfeveringly
discharged, with the molt benevolent at
tention, its various duties, until Djalh
put a period to their exertions, and they
fell themselves, under the blow they were
warding off from others; âyet, while we
look back with mournful regret, to the
loss of our companionsâgratiude to the
Supreme Disposer of Eventsâre
quires our acknowledgement of hjs inter
position in the preservation of our own
lives, and of those of so many of our fel
low-citizens.
