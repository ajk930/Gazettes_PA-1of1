Sig.,
EVE RY kind of condudt which has a
j public effect is a proper fubjed of Ihe press,
hence pulpit abuse, and pulpit impro
i- pieties are not exempt from this tribunal,
r. It is full time that a gown or black coat
should cease to Shield a man fipm the cen
s lure which mifconducl deserves ; for it is
II " ot * profejlon, but his virtues that
e . ' belter him from reproach. Merit
fT is entitled to reverence and esteem whether
s it is enclosed in homespun or brocade, and
ill-natuie, illiberally, bigotry, or hypocri*
iy ought to be exposed though covered bf
a mitre. Humility, meekness, charity,
peace and goodwill to all men ought to en
ter into the composition of every man who
profeffes to preach the gospel, and he who
is devoid of such attributes, is nu better,
li as good as the deist that he reviks.
I have been led to these reflections by
a publication tinder the' name of James
Abercrombie, which appeared in your
paper of this day. If it was the inten-*
Jkht of that gentleman to exculpate him
ie!f from the charge made by some of your
correfpjndents, by an extract from his fer
mon,he has lpillakcn his capacity, and has
underrated the understanding of the pub
lic. He is charged with abuling the
French nation, and how has he acquitted
himfelf of it ? By using almost the fame
language which Pitt used in the House
of Commons, and charging them with ir
religion ! Religion is supposed n.-ceffary
to every man of virtue, and to fay that a
man is devoid of it, is to charge him with
"wee. Mr. A. has called them a nation
of deists, and his abuse would not have
been icfs. had he called thera a nation of
rascals, for deism and rascality must be fy
nonimous.
But let me aflc what had his sermon to
do with France ? Had he taken a political
text, that it was neceflary to lug her into
his sermon neck and shoulders ? Or was
he fearfnl that his present profeflion was
to be supported by bigotry and fuperjlitian
and that as the French had crumbled theirt
into dull, their a tars were insecure here ?
Or was he disposed to plead th Â» cause of
the combined despots, and make his essay
to alienate the American heart from
France?
A prcacher must be much at a loss sos
a fubjeft, or he must have an uncommon
portion of gall in his composition, who
could arraign the religion of France at the
bar of America! 1 hat nation has cer
tainly the right to judge for itfelf in thÂ«
important concern of its own
happiness; and the conforming clergy
theiehave as much right, and would haveaa
much justice on their fide, to traduce thi
preachers here as they have to traduce
them.
The French revolution is no text for a
preacher of the gospel, it would furnifh a
fubiime one for a preacher of politics;
but as the gospel contemplates peace, and
politics war, the difciplfes of the one are
very unfit to be the difeiples of the other;
to mix them, therefore, is to produce ail
heterogeneous compound, not correfpotu
dent with the pacific character of religion,
and mtlft require a mind much better fit-'
ted for scenes of tumuh and blood; than
the mild tranquil aad beneficial {hade of
the gospel.
I did not hear the sermon complained
of, and was disposed to doubt the truth of
the charge against Mr. A. but his irifen*
ded juuihcation hsg made stronger impref.
fiors on my mind, than the paragraphs to
which he replies could pofiifcly have done â¢
for he has left no doubt with me that he
Â« unfriendly to a revolution, which has
t.he happiness of mankind for its object,
and that he is disposed to contribute his
mite to produce abhorrence of it in the
American world. Whether such a dispo
sition u fitted for Mr. A's present profcf
ljon I will leave to the benevolent heart to
determine.

Mr: Fevno,
There are few persons of .good sense
who hope to fee liberty prevail in France,
who have not been (hocked and discoura
ged by the rncafures they have adopted to
abolish religion. It is not merely the Ca
tholic doJlrilie that is attackedâÂ«t is the
Christian religion. The head and founder
of it has been treated with a degree of ir
reverence, which in this country will
pass for incredible. Bigots in politics
may if they please, attempt to suppress
the natural feelings of wonder, of disgust,
of alarm for the coitfequences of this un
heard of profligacy of manners and princi
ples," which considerate persons will deem
more dangerous to the liberty and happi
ness of France, than the combined armies.
A clergyman whom I do not know, but
v who bears the character of a man of sense
and virtue, exhorts his congregation to
beware of the contagion of these mon
strous examples. What minister would
not betray the cause of religion, of morals,
of heaven and earth, if he fufTered the
threats, or the newspaper abuse of bigots
v and perfccators in politics, to deter him
from the discharge of this obvious and ur
gent duty ?
Yet a writer, who calls himfelf " no
Pharisee," and who might as properly
have fubferibed to his jargon of illiberal
abuse, no Scribe, has arraigned Mr. A.
for preaching against the irreligious pro
ceedings in France. What ha 6heto do
with France, fays the PharafeeâWhat
has he to do. with vice and irreligion, is
the real questionâHe has to do with them
as a preacher of religion, to expose them
to his hearers Aâhe has a right, and is bound
to enforce his exhortations by the exam
ples of the Jews, or Romans, or French.
" No Pharisee" mistakes the time and
place. Our churches are not yet to be
(hut up, nor the Bibles burnt. Our cler
gy are to be respeCted and beloved. The
attempt of " no Pharisee," to libel a mi
nister, and to suppress the freedom of the
pulpit, is a proof of the progress that li
centiousness and irreligion are making. I
venture to predict, that when it lhall be
come the general practice of America to
vilify and peifecute our clergy, there will
hot be left, Liberty, Law nor Religion.

CONGRESS.
House of Reprefcntativcs.
Friday, May 2.
The fullfwing olfervations were made by
Mr. Smith of Maryland, on the propos
ed tax, on fnujf and manufactured tobac
-10 :âThe house in committe of the -whole.
Mr., Smith considered the observations
of the member who had just fat down, as
amusing, and ingenious, but not fatisfac
tory. To him, it seemed a very odd
Scheme to crush American manufactures
in the bud. Men of capital and enter
prize advanced large sums of money in e
reCting fnuff mills. After long exertions,
they began to reap the reward of their
expetices and their labor. At that em'titi
cal moment, the government souses down
upon them with an excise. In his opini
on,. the resolution before the committee
comprehended very great injustice to the
manufad&ujers of tobacco. He understood
that a fnuff mill required a capital of five
thousand pounds to begin with. We are
going to impose eight cents per pound on
fnuff, which was more than double the
price of the raw material. Here Mr.
Smith inferred, that it would be necessa
ry for the fnuff maker to posses an additi
on of double his present capital; so that
instead of five thousand pounds, he muff
possess fifteen thousand, before he can
lupport his present business. After pay
ing so vast a duty, house rent, the wages
of journeymen, and a multiplicity of other
ca(h disbursements, he is to give credit to
his customers for fix, nine, or twelve
months. There was another hardfliip
he mutt keep accounts of his sale. (The
words of the report rtferved to by Mr.
Smith, are as follows : "he (hall enteijo
to bond, with fufficient security to render
a faithful account every three months, of
the quantity of tobacco or fnuff fold or
sent out, within that period. Previous
to taking any tobacco, for the putpofe of
being manufactured, he (hall notify the
fame Jo the office of inspeCtion, and (hall
keep a book, in which (hall be entered
daily, the quantity of Jobacco or fnuff
fold or sent out ill each day.") This re
gulation may often prove a very great ]
hard(hip< It will require an extra clerk, 1
at ao eSp^nt-eof thrle, four, orfh'ehun
d(Â£d ffollurs per annum. For the manu- t
facturera of fnuff, this might be practica
ble : but, at lead in hl> part of the coun
try. (Maryland) : tobacco-spinners are 1
poor, work theinlelves, Â«Â»nd employ ttoys
to fell, many of whom, cannot so much'
as read. How are they to keep accounts,
or how are they to escape perjury, when
you bid them do what they cannot pofii
bly do ? Bclides, tobacco is frequently
fold not by weight, but by the yard. It
had been (aid, that this tax was hot more
exceptionable than the excise upon
This comparison did not hold.
By the tax on distilleries, the agricul
ture of the United States was greatly
promoted. Land that would out bCar
wheat, was, in confeqilence of that ex
cise, and the encouiagement, at the fame
time given to this manufacture, covered
with crops of rye. Hence there vVas no
jult resemblance in the two cases. But if
we are to excise every thing, Mr. Smith
said that the committee might excise, as
properly as tobacco, those ltrings of oni
ons, that were sent from ConneCticut all
over the Union. They were the staple
of that state, as tobacco was of Virginia,
and were equally fit to produce a revenue.
He expeCted that we (hould next hear of
an excise upon nails. Protecting duties 1
had been laid for the encouiagement of
that manufacture in America. Progress
had consequently been made in the bufi- 1
ness ; and now there was nothing want- 1
ing, but a smart excise duty, to knock it 1
on the head, under the pretence of railing 1
a revenue. Printed cottons, linen, paper, 1
were also articles that we (hould no doubt
saddle with a (tamp duty, as had been the 1
cafe in Britain, and thus crush that infant 1
manufactory. In the cafe of the present
tax, it would be said that the manufactu
rer must lay it on his cullomers. Yes.
But will his cultomers advance him a ca
pital double to what he had before ? Be
sides the tax, he must havevilits of excifs
men, which are in themselves, extremely
troublesome.
In fine, he considered this as a dange
rous precedent. It commenced a fyltem
of taxations on internal manufactures,
which would intimidate men from adven
turing their capitals in manufactories, sub
jeCt to be saddled with excises, the mo
ment they begun to be profitableâor
whenever they were enabled (as in the
cafe of fnuff) to exclude the foreign arti
cle. Tobacco and fnuff were, good arti
cles to begin with, for few, except the
manufacturer would complain ; he consi
dered this, as the opening wedge, and
(hould vote againlt the measure.

We are allured, that the plan of the next
campaign will totally differ from the lalt. It
It appears certain that the Prufiian army
considerably augmented and joined by the
contingents of the Circles of the empire will
be exclusively charged with the operations
on the Rhine, and that the Austrian troops
now there will join the trmy under Prince
Saxe Cobourg. It is hoped, this latter
inafs will be fufficient to pulh with vigdur

" Citizens,
" The time of deceiving is past. I pro
mise you the naked truth, and it is as fol
laws:
" 1 he march of the columns ordered to
traverse the Vendee country, has been the
means of destroying 6000 rebels, who
were scattered about, the retaking of a
very important post in the interior of the
country, and the capture of an immense
quantity of baggage. The banditti who
had the audacity to enter Chollett, by
striking terror into the garrison, have tit
the dull:. They have been (lain by a di
vision detached from the army of the
north, commanded by General Cordelier,
whom I sent in pursuit of them.
" Another division, wider General j t
Duqiitfnoy, has put to flight t! ( e main 1
body of Charatte's army, in the thicket,
and killed eight or 900 of them. On 1
the 26th Pluvoife, General Cdrdelier.put i
ij or 1600 banditti to the bayonet, near >
Beaupreau, which has very much weaken- r
ed La Roche Jaquelin's army. r
Three hundred of the rebels have just 1
been {hot in the sorest of Pince; and b
many other advantages have been gained J
by General Haxo. t
" The trifling ill fucee(TeÂ» we have ex- e
perienced, and which have been so much ]
exaggerated, do not deserve notice.â 1
There are still some numerous parties in <
Vendee, who are so much more dangerous, (
as thev alone occupy the right bank of (
the Loire. My predecessor has allowed 1
them too long a time to repose. We t
must yet make very strong efforts to ter- 1
minate this war; but if the soldiers will I
only fight courageously, and the princi- <
pal officers second my orders, if all the i
constituted authorities will join me, and t
if the patriots are not milled, I {wear that c
all ft all be well." t

of the line composing the French fleet,
we believe, is not at present clearly afcer- 1
tained. 1
The manifefto of the king of Prulfia has '
given the lie direst to all the insinuations, j
all the declarations, and all the aflertions
of the party writers, who have again "and {
again positively affii med, that the king of.
Piufiia's concuirence in the general cause
was not to be relied on, and that he would
take the firft opportunity of retiring from '
the confederation agairift France, when he 1
could promote his private views of arabi- '
tion and interest.

COLONEL MACK.
The following Ihort account of this
Austrian officer, who is just arrived in
London, will, we hope, be acceptable to
our readers.
Col. Mack is a native of Wurzburg,
and son of a tradesman of that place
He began his military career as acormnpn
huiTar in an- Austrian regiment, but his
uncommon talents for military drawing,
his unwearied application to this art, and
his extraordinary 11; ill in laying down plans
loon raised him from obscurity, and in
troduced him to the-notice of Maifhal
Laudohn. His dillinguifhed conduct at'
the affair of LifTa â  still more ingratiated
him with that great commander."
Field Mai ilial Laudohn had made all
his disposition for crofflng the Danube,
and attacking, that place. Mr. Mack,
â who had formed the plan of passing the
river, as well as that attack, went the
night before to the Marshal to receive his
lait prdcrs ; -when this General informed
him, that he had jail received intelli
gence of the Turks having been reinfoi
ced at JLiffa by a corps of 30,000 men,
and that of course he had given up h-=
project of an attack, as, after having
palfed the river, in cafe of meeting witii
any difatter, he should be at a loss how tq
effect his retreat.. Mr. Mack did not
credit the report of the reinforcement,
btit could not prevail on the MarJhal tc
execute his intended attack. Mr. Mack
left the Genera], crofted the Danube in a
boat, accompanied by a single Hulan,
and stole into the place, got certain
information of the supposed teinforcetner.t
not having arrived, took a Tu'rkift
officer prisoner ,in the suburb, re-passed
the Danube, and at 4 o'clock in the mor
irfg informed the Marfaal of his expedi
tion. On this report the Aultrian army
passed the river, and took LifTa, the whole
garrison of which place, confiding of
men, were made prisoners of war.
In the present war, Col. Mack; ftp.!
attached to the Staff, has much contri
buted to the successes obtained at the be
ginning of the campaign, especially the
attack and capture of the camp of ,Far.
mars, for which he made all the neteffa.
ry difgofitipes. 111 this affair he reiceiv
ed a wound, the cure erf which obligee
him to repair to BrufTets. He exptÂ£tec
to be made Quarter-Matter General o]
Prince Cobourg's amy, but this place
having fallen to the (hare of Prince Ho
henlohe, his wound afforded him a pre
text to retire to Vienna. Called these tÂ£
the conferences held with respect ta the
plan of operations for the enitiing cam
paign, he has caused a system to be adopt
ed totally different from that which hai
been purlued in the prececding campaigns
This he has laid at Bruftt's before th(
commanding Generals of the confederal
troops, and he is to communicate the
fame to our government. We learn thai
every where it has met with the fu|kl!
approbation.
PHILADELPHIA,
MAY 5.
A letter from a gentleman of refpe&ebili
ty and information in Liverpool, dated Marc I
3d, to his friend in this city, faysâ" Thai
in his opinion, Peace is aÂ». event which i.
not very remote. âThe writer eSs this iettei

Says a Corrcfpondent,
It is recommended to a certain affernblj
to establish some rule, if they have none al
ready, and if they have to enforce it, for the
fuppreflion of impure and coarle allusions ir

If such instances have occurred in the hiir

Extract of a letter from England, datec
Feb. 17th, 1794, and received by the Wil

" The business of Congress is very im

Extras from the proceedings of a meeting
of Dr'egaies from the eleltiort diftriEls of
Allegany Coun'y, held at Pitt/burgh,
April 19, THOMAS MORTON in the
â  Chair.
At this juncture we have France to as
sist us, who, ftould we now, take a part,
will riot fail to stand by us until Canada is
independent hi Britain, and the instigators
of Indian hostilities are removed ; and
(hould we.lie by, while France is struggling
for her liberties, it cannot be supposed
that he'r republic will embark in a war on
oiir account after fne fnall have' been vic
torious. It was for this reason that though
we approved of the conduct of the Presi
dent, and the judiciary of the United
States, in their endeavors to preserve peace;
and an imparti.il neutrality until the sense
of the n ition had been taken on the neces
sity of retaliation by a filially declaring
war, yet now that the Congrtfi have been
convened, and such jult grounds exist, we
are weary of their tardinels in coming for
ward to measures of reprisal.
Eat we have observed with great pain
thai our councilswant the integiityorfpirit
of republicans. This we attribute to the
pernicious influence of stock-holders or
their subordinates; and our minds feel this
with fomueh indignancy, that we are al
ipuft ready to with for a Hate of revolution
and the guillotine of France for a fliort
space in order to infliÂ£t punifh'ment on the
mifcrearits that enervate and disgrace our
government.'
Extmft from the Speech of Mr. Fox.
" The condudl of ministers towards
neutral powers, Mr. Fox laid, had been
unwarrantable. How could they forbid
Genoa so be neutral in a cause, of which,
a few months before, they had themselves
been neutralâtheir neutrality in which
tliey had even boasted in that House.â
The order, jffued relative to American
ships, they had the prudence to withdraw,
and he hoped the retraiflion had come in
time to amend the error.âGeneral Wash
ington's admirable speech displayed all
the temper, with all the firmnefs of that
great man, and it was apparent enough,
that untkr his guidance, America would
strenuously preserve her rank among na
tions. The misconduct and insolence of
Genet, the French envoy, had not pro
voked General Washington to any mea
sures, which could tend unneeeiTarily to
produce a rupture with'the French. He
had atTcrted his own dignity by de/nand
- iug the recal of that minnler, which was
granted, and the intercourse of America
with France was preferred."

NEW-YORK, May 3.
Thursday night Capt. Clark was going to
his Ihip, he was attacked by an attrocious
scoundrel, with a long knife tapered oiflike
the point of a sword ; he seized Capt. Clark,
j and fixed the knife to his brealt, and threat
ened that he would run it into him, unless he
delivered his purse immediately. Captain
Clark while he was threatening, took the
opportunity of giving him a blow on the
' head, which ftunnedand caused him to drop
the knife, which Capt. Clark took up: The
villain efeaped.
On Thursday evening arrived the Xebec
Sins Culottes, Captain Molinary, from a
Ci-uize.âAbout fix leagues off the Hook (he
took the brig Mary, Capt. Collin, of White
haven, Great Britain. The Sans Culottes
carries 10 long nine pounders and 70 men,
and has taken many rich prizes on this coals.

BOSTON, April 26.
From Gibralter.
Arrived here, the Ihip Commerce, Capt.
Loring, from Gibraltar, in 64 days. He
came out with an Englifli convoy, in compa
ny with the Raven, Plummer, of Boltoa,
wco put into Cadiz.â*By accounts from the
Levant, there was but one American lhip
within the Streights. A few days previous
to Capt. Loring's failing, art Algerine brig,
of 22 guns, and >280 men, came into Gi
braltar, to water, after Wh'ich (he failed on a
cruise to the westward. By means of a Mooriih
gentleman, who wa3 requested to aik the
officers, the force which would cruize from
Algiers this Summer, we learn, they would
have at sea, 1 frigate 44 guns, 1 do. 36, 1 do.
28, one polacre ihip 24, 2 brigs, 22 each, 1
do. 14, 1 snow 16, 3 Xebecks ; and from
Oran, they would fit out 1 brig 18 guns, 1
schooner, (formerly of Marblehead) 6 guns,
I Tartan, 4 guns, and 2 Xebecks. They are
all well manned, and equipped. They were
then on a cruize of 60 days. The number
of Christian slaves in Algiers, were 362,
about 130 Americans. To alleviate their
fufferings, a benevolent character at Cadiz,
forwarded them 1000 dollars, and a gentle
man of Hamburgh, 5001. sterling. The n
American prizes, fold for 410,000 dollars,
and the estimated ransom for the 130 Ame
ricans, is 240,000.
For the Gazette of the United States,
Mr. Fenno,
It is said by .some, that Mr. Bachc
writes many of the pieces which are pub
lilhed in his paper, as from Correspond
entsâl am convinced the charge Is un
jult ; and as the freedom of the press, de
pends upon Editors feeling unembarrafled,
I wish to contribute my mite towards pla
cing the Editor of the General Adverti
ser upon a footing which I think he de
serves.
You, Mr. Fenno, have doubtless obftr
ved an attack upon your Gazette in Mr.
Bache's paper of this morning, said to
be, " From Correspondents," in the plu
ral number ; and as this is,very unjustly,
fnid to be written by Mr. Bache, I think
I can set that matter right.
It was drawn up and submitted to the
consideration of "a certain Society, and af
ter it was Corrected &' patted there, sent
to another Society of the fame kind, and
pa (Ted thereâand privately ordered to be
printed. If fan Aioned by the public, the
iubftance of it. .will come out in the next
Refol/es. Please to inform the gentlemen,
that the competition is too mar.ly, polite
and elegant, to escape noticeâand that
they may publish it among their Resolves
with the utmost fafety, it certainly can
not ciijgract them, and probably will gain
them credit-
But, Sir, let them learn, that while
folly goes Only to ceremony, and meddles
not with fuhjlance, men of sense will look
on, with unconcci n, but beware of touch
ing the sacred palladium of our Liberty,
Government. The present French Minif
ter,is too worthy a chara&er.to, befufpeft
ed of,a wish to interfere with our internal
government or the administration of itâ
and alt ho' knaves and fools, expressed a
fellow-feeling for his predecessor, when
his unjiithfiaLle conduct was exposed and
reprobated; yet it is sincerely hoped the
prefeut Mimfter, may be spared, by that
fame junto, when the only accusation they
can bring acjainft him, is honeity and pro
priety of conduct.
It must however be acknowledged, that
he 13 in danger from them, for by their
attacks upon the Senate, Cfyief Jufti'ce
and President, it is very manifeft, they
either cannot, or will not suppress their
general antipathy to integrity, wherever
they discover it.
Really Sir, this kind of gentry who
.write the pieces above alluded to in Mr.
Bache's paper, and others of a similar
nature, excite the old question, Cuius
Pecus ?

The Public are cautioned to
beware of counterfeited Five Dollar Bilts of
the Bank 6f the United States, and Twenty
Dollar Bilts of tlx Bank of North America,
fe-veral erf which have appeared in circulation
within a fe<tU days phft ; they are a good ge
neral imitation of the getuiine Bills, tut may
be diflinguifhed by the fallowing
MARKS.
Five Dollar Bills cf tfu Bank of the
United States.
ALL that have appeared have the letter F.
for t'hffir Alphabetical Mark.
The Texture of the Paper is thicker and
whiter and it takes the ink more fieely than
the genuine paper.
The O. in the word Company is finaller
than the M. and other letters of that word,
so that a line extended from the top of the Â»>,
to touch the top of the M. would extend con
siderably above the-range ps the \V-huie word.
In the word United the lettsrs are narrow,
erand closer than the reft of the bill
The i and.y m the word promise are not
parallel, the yinclining much more iorwarJ
than tjie i.
The engraving is badly executed,the strokes
of all the Letters are stronger and the devie
in themargii- particularly is risuch coarser and
appeals darker rfian itr the true bills. Some
el the counterfeits bear date in I 791 âWhere-
as the Bank was not in operation till Decern
ber, and no five dollar bills were iflued in
ihat year.
Twenty Dollar Bills of the Bank of North
America.
ALL that have'aooeared have the letter
ALL that have" appeared have the letter
B. for their alphabetical mark.
Tftey are printed on a paper nearly fjmtlar
to that of the couitfer&it Five Dollar Notes
above dcfcnbed ; the enÂ£r"sfvir\g is bette' exe
ucted, and they approach nearer to the ap
pearance of the genuine biJls.
The fine ruled lines through the word Twen
ty, in the body of the bill, are in number th rÂ»
tqen in the genuine bÂ«lis, and but twelve in
the counterfeits.
Tj'fie word Company is much like the ff/ne
Word in the Five 1 Dollar B lis &s defer ibed a
bove, the o being less than the and others
following.
There is no'ftroke to the fin the word North
whereas in the genuine bills the stroke is well
defined
The let Cert eat in the word Twenty, to the
left hand at the bottom, do nor come down to ,
the line, hot are fa cqt as to give an irregular J
appearance to the word, the Tw and 'bey go- .
ing below them.
The fjgnaiure 1 Nixon, has the appear
ance of being written with lamb-black and |
oil, and differs from other inks used in
printing the bills aÂ»d the cafhiei's lignatuie.
It is fuopofed thefc forgeries were committed
in some of lh â¢ Southern States, as all the coun
terfeits thai have appeared, have come from
thence, and two perfofts have been apprehend
ed in on fuipicion of being the author
of them.
The reward of ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS
will be paid to auy Peifon or Perfops who lhall
difco-vei and profecuie to convict.on the feveial
offenders of the following descriptions or any
of them, viz.
The perfori or pcrfrns, Who manufactured
thepaper on which the Bills arc printed.
The pier fan ar pet lons, who engraved the
plates.
The printer or prinrers, Â«f the bills.
Every person who has aÂ£led as a principal in
any other way, in the counterfeiting and utter
ing the said b'lis.
Pniladielphia, March 28, 1794
April 22, 1794,
Other counterfeit bills
of the Bank of the Uni ted States have appeared
in circulation..
The denomination is of TWENTY DOL
LARS,and the alphabetical mark is the let
ter B.
They may be distinguished from the genu
ine by the following MARKS :
The paper of the counterfeits is of a more
tendjr texture and gloffey furface than the
genuine, and there is no water mark in them.
The letter C. in the word Cashier, in the
true WHS is strongly riiarked, whereas in the
counterfeits, the whole letter is a fine hair
stroke, evidently in an ufifinilhed state. The
letters in the wo-d demand, is badly formed
and the whole word ill done, and there is no
comma at the end of it, as there is in the
genuine bilh.
The nparginal device, is much da>ker in
the fa He, than in the genuine bills owing to
the shade strokes being coarfc, much nearer
together, and consequently much more nu
merous.TKis cfifference firlkes the eye at firft
view.
The fame reward of ONE THOUSAND
DOLLAJRS,. will he paid for apprehending, &
profeciitjng so tonviftion tie several above
described Offenders in iefpe<?l to this, as to
the la'ft deferibed hills.
