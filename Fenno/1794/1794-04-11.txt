The Public are cautioned to
beware of counterfeited Fine Dollar Bilt'3 of
the Bank of the United States, and Twenty
Dollar Bills of the Bank of North America,
feiieral of which have appeared in circulation
within a few days pajl; they are A good ge
neral imitation of the genuine Bills, but may
be diflinguifhed by the following
MARK S.
Five Dollar Bills of the Batik of the
United States.
ALL that have appeared have the letter F.
for their Alphabetical Mark.
The Texture of the Paper is thicker and
whiter and it takes the ink more freely than
the genuine paper.
The O. in the word Company is smaller
i than the M. and other letters of that word,
so that a line extended from the top of the O,
to touch the top of the M would extend con-
GdeiaMy above the range of the whole word.
In the word United the letters are narrow!
i erand closer together than the reft of tljÂ£ bill
The i and fin the word promise afe not
parallel, the yinclining much more forward
than the i.
The engraving is badly executed,the stroke*
of all the Letters are stronger and tl * devi< e
in the margin particularly isrrnich coarser and
appears darker than in the true bills. Some
ef the counterfeits bear dare in 1791 âWhere-
as toe Bank was not in operation till Decem
ber, and no five dollar bills were iflued in
that year. ' JjtiL
Twenty Dollar Bills of the Bank of North
v AmericaÂ»
ALL that have appeared have the letter
B. tor their alphabetical mark.
They are printed on a paper nearly similar
to that of the couuterfeit Five Dollar Notes
above described ; the engraving is oettet exe
ucted, and they approach nearer to the ap
pearance cf the genuine bills.
Theifi/ie ruled lines through the word Twen
ty, in the body of the bill, are tnnumbe' thir
teen in the genuine bills, and but twelve in
ihe counterfeits.
The word Company is much; like the fame
word in the Five Dollar Bills as described a -
bove, the 0 being less thin the m, and others
' âfyjl&TrC *
There is no stroke to the / in the word North
whereas in the genuine bills the stroke is well
defined.
The letters tnt in the word Twenty, to the
left hand at the bottom, do nor come down to
the fine, but afe so cut as to give an irregular
appearance to the word, the Tw and go
ing below them.
The Signature J. Nixon, has the appear
ance of being written with lamp-black and.
oil, and differs from the other inks used in
printing the bills and the cafliier's lignature.
It is supposed these forgeries were committed
in feme of the Southern States, as all the coun
terfeits that have appeared, have come from
thence, and two persons have been apprehend
ed in Virginia, on suspicion of being the authors
of them.
The reward o(ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS
will be paid to any Person or Persons who fbal 1 ,
discover and prosecute to conviction the several
offenders of the following descriptions or any
of them, viz.
The person or persons, who manufa&ured

HoUje of Rcprefen tativas
Mr. (Giles's reply to Mr. W. Smith's ob
servations on the palling' of the naval
armament bill. -
( Continued.)
Believing this principle to be a just one,
he would apply it to the exifling state of
things between the United States and G.
Britain. Almost at soon as Great Bri
tain had taken part in the iniquitous war
against France, the executive of the United
States manifefted their regard for peacf,
by proclaiming their existing state of neu
trality, and recommending to theii citi
zens not only the observance of neutrality,
but of impartial neutrality. Although the
partiality of the American people for the
cause of France, was well known, altho'
at that moment their affe&ions for the
French 1 nation were addrefled by the most
honorable and powerful considerations that
ever existed between two nations. The
peculiar similarity between the willing
French cause, and that which had just
given birth to American liberty and inde
pendence; the material agency which the
French nation had exerted in bringing
about that event: and the existing prin
ciples of government here, the pfoduft
of the revolution, which are the great
object of attack by the combination against
France.
A pure and laudable regard for peace,
and a destination of war however, had o
vercome all these sensations, and produced
a neutrality which he believed on the part
of the United States had been rigidly ob
served, at least, he was Jure, that such
was the intention of government. In
this state ef things Great Britain com
menced an attack upon this state of neu
trality, which it was certainly her interefl
to preserve, and which (he ought to have
deemed a favor to obtein. Great Britain
continued to keep pofTeffion of polls upon
the acknowledged territory of the Unit
ed States, to carry on a contraband trade
with our savage enemy. She shortly after
our proclaimed neutrality proceeded to in
terrupt or laAiful trade with our allies.
She fuzed, condemned and fanftioned the
complete transfer of the property of Ameri
can citizens to her oivil fubjeds ; and as if
there could be no limits to her idiquity &
resentment, (lie has contrived to open up
on our eastern frontiers, a barbarous ene
my to aid in making depredations uppn
our commerce.
These ass constitute injuries which a
mount to war, and they are infinitely ag
gravated, both by the perfidy which at
tended the execution of some of thein :
and the total want of provocation, for the
commiflion of any of them.if then Great Britain, (hall have com- â 
Butted acts towards the United .States, j
which furnifti just cause of war, the Uni
ted States possets the right confidently
with the laws of nations, to exercise any
act towards Great Britain, which would
be juftifiable in a state of war. The U
nited States having received the injuries,
are authorised to feleA such measures and
means as they may deem the molt expedi
cnt f#r felf-prefervation and indemnifica
tion. Reprisal is within their power
All other means of redtefs, are without
their power. In such a state of things,
reprisal is a rightâreprisal is a dutyâ¢ An
obje&ion more plaulible than solid, has
been made to this course of reasoning, that
the individuals who will be the immedi-.j
ate obje&s of the reprisal, have not been
the immediate agents of the aggteffion.
The laws of nations state, that the pro
perty of individuals, is as much a subjeCt
of reprisal, as the property of the aggres
sing nation ; but as the nation is the im
mediate agent in the wrong, the individu
al who fuftainsan injury thereby, becomes
intitled to recompence from his nation.
The nation which commits the wrong, by
this process will ultimately sustain the lois.
Hence in the present cafe, the innocent
and unfufpe&ing vi&ims of the United
States, have received losses from the law
less aggressions of Great Britain, and the
question is, whether they shall finally sus
tain these.losses, without any clear claim
of indemnification upon the government
of the United States ? Or whether the
losses (hall be transferred to Britirti fub
jcÂ£ts, who will thereby poflefs the cleared
claim for recompcnce, from the Biitifh
government ? He thought the law 3ot
God, the laws of morality, the laws of
reason, the laws of nations, would all pro
nounce, that thr British Government which
had done the -wrong, Jhouhl ajford the re
camping.
Mr. Giles said, that if the losses were
to be ultimately borne by the individual
fubjefts of Great Britain, the remedy
would feetn to be a lrarfh one ; but even
in that cafe, the only alternatives left to
the United States would be to fay, whe
ther their own citizens, to whom they
have promised proteft'on fho ild finally
sustain the lofles, or the Briti/h fubjcÃs,
f> whom they have promised no projec
tion. But the situation of the individu
als, who may be the fubjedts of reprisal,
is greatly meliorated, by the coniidera
tion of their just claim to recompence from
their own government ; which he had no
doubt but they would ultimately obtain,
if they were put into a situation to de
mand it; but if they (hould ultimately be
denied justice, it would be a confutation â 
to reflect, that it was the in just ice of
their own Government, not of the Uni
ted State?.
He observed, that a reprisal in the way
proposed, flood upon the fame ground as
the invafton of the property, in every o
ther cafe did, and was juftified upon the
fame principle, to wit, Self-prefervation.
He presumed if there existed an acknow
ledged state of war, letters of marque
and reprisal, commiflions to privateers,
&c. would be deemed juftifiable and ex
pedient, and that no discrimination would
be made betweeu the property of indivi
duals and the property of the nation ; yet
the -invasion of the rights of property in
that cafe, would be as palpable, as in the
cafe of the reprisal proposed, with this
aggravation", that in that cafe, the indivi
dual sustaining the loss, would not be in
titled to ultimate recompence from the go
vernmentâin the cafe proposed he would
be intitled to recompence. He observed,
that the British nation had not discovered
this delicate discrimination between na
tional and individual property, in their
late inftruftions given to their privateers
and {hips of war, although they had sus
tained no wrong ; and he thought their
conduit an example in point for the Uni
ted States, who had received the injury
and committed none.
A gentleman (Mr. Smith, S. C.) yes
terday attempted to make a diftin&ion
between vessels at sea, and other pioperty;
although he acknowledged that at the firft
blush he could discern no dittinction in
principle 1 .
Mr. Giles said, that every species of
property, flood on the fame principle, the
promise made by the government to afford
protection to all propertyâthe fame rights
are attached to every species of property,
and the government is bound to afford an
equal security to all. A sentence read
yesterday, by a gentleman (Mr. S. Smith)
from a writer upon the laws of nations,
clearly lhews the fight, of nation to
inake rcpriinl ilpjn nil the effetts of
i individuals of an aggfcffiog nation indil
| criminately, Jfock in the public Jutih ;
which has Ikl*ii exempted, undev the idea
of its being a pledge in the hands of go
vernment, âthe wi*h}K>kl:nfc of which,
would be a breach of public faith. He
believed that the practice and policy of
some nations, might have given rife to
this diftindtion, b<it be doubted whether
the practice had been uniform and univer
sal, and he was 'clear that there was no
rational diftindtion in principle. The idea
that the public funds are a pledge in the
hands of government and ought slot there
fore to be touched, is equally applicable
. to every other species ot property. In
the cafe of contracts between individuals,
the government guarantees the perform
ance upon the refuial of one party to pay,
or comply. In ths cafe of lands or per
sonal chattels, the government guarantees
the exclusive enjoyment to the proprietor; -
it would be equally a violation of faith,
for the government to deny its obligation ;
in the one cafe, as in the other, and no- j
thing could juftify an invasion of the j
rights of property, in any cafe, but Seif- â 
preservationâthe JirJl of all rights, and ,
the highest of all duties. . i
He positively denied that any pre-emi- ,
nence was due to one species of property, j
over,another. He said, however, that tins j
discussion was not immediately necelfary, ,
as the resolution under consideration, did
not embrace the stock in the funds of the
United States.

PARIS, December 14.
Yefteiday Anacharfis Clootz, and Dll
- both deputies of the C.invention, â 
were expelled from tlie Jacobin Society ; j
Roberfpierre chiefly prompted their ex
pulsion, and was much applauded.
All of the officers and crew of the snip
' l'Apollon, sent from Toulon to Rochfort,
by permission of lord Hood, h.lve been
accused of an intention to corrupt the pub
lic mind, and delivered up to the revolu
tionary tribunal eftablUhed in that place.
The act of accufatton pafied against
them contained the following cbargts:
" That it is proved by the diaries kept
by the prisoners, that they cali the most
distinguished patriots, anarchifls, ruffians,
hangmen, cut-throats, wortty children of
Marat; that they drained ever)- nerve to
dissolve the Popular Society ; that they
trod the national badge under foot, hoifttd
the white cockade,cried Vive LouisXVll.
and datad their writings in the firft year
of his reign ; that it had been in their
power to save the French squadron, and
that they preferred to deliver it up to the
English ; that they reiteiately rtfufed to
quit the harbor and engage the hoflile
squadron, by which Toulon would have
been saved ; that they furnifhed detach
ments to light against Carteaux; that they
received and dillributed among the crews
considerable sums to corrupt them ; that
they corresponded with the emigrants;
that they contributed to the infamous ar
rest of the Representatives Bayle and Beau
vais : finally, that they demanded certifi
cates, attesting their good conduit of the
traitors of Toulon."
They were all found guilty, and fuffer
ed death by the guillotine.
The commissioners at Bordeaux, in a
letter dated Nov. 30, slate, that the guil
lotine is busy in decapitating the rich, the
merchants and monopolizers. On the
28th all the a&ors of the Great Theatre
were put under arrest as aristocrats. A
great number of fuipecied persons were
also taken into custody the lame night,
out of the number of 2000 pcrfans who
were at the theatre.
The female citizen Marbenf, a mer
chant, has been committed to the priion
of St. Pelagie, on a charge of monopoly.
In her cattle at Champ, a small village, the
officers found 18,000 swt. of soap, 15000
weight of sugar, between 15 and 16,000
chaldrons of charcoal, 30,000 faggots,
and a great quantity of coffee, kali, and
other articles of merchandifc, which has
been put in circulation.
In the night of the 30th ult. 200 of
the most principal merchants of Bourdeaux
were put under arrest, and will be deliver
ed up to the revolutionary tribunal to be
guillotined.

NATIONAL CONVENTION.
Sunday, Nov. 10.
" We have long," said Seyes, " wished
to fee reason triumph over fuperttition and
fanaticifm. The day at length arrived,
and I rejoice at it as one of the greatest.
bk'flings that could happen to the French
Republic. Though I have for many
years laidafide the ecclesiastical character,
let me, however, be permitted to declare
at present, that I know no other worship
than that of liberty and equality, and no
other religion than the love of mankind
and my country. I have lived victim of
superstition, but I was never its inttrument.
, None can fay he was ever deceived by me;
| and maily are indebtd to me for the truth.
! At the moment my reason was disengaged
from the fatal prejudices by which it was
fettered the energy of infurrefltion entered
mv heart. Since that period I have been
retained in my facredotal habit by the fame
force which retained other free fouls in
chains. These were all destroyed on the
day of the revolution.
" I have been known only by my ef
forts for liberty and equality It was as a
plebeian, a Deputy of the People, and not
as a Priest, for 1 was then no longer one,
that I was called to the National Aficm
bly. I cannot, like many of my colleagues,
deiiver to you the paper or titles of my for
mer Hate ; for a long time they have not
been in existence. I have no relignation to
gi?e in to you, because I have no eccleli
a(lleal employment; but I have ftiil an of
fering to make my countiy, that of an an
nuity of 10,000 livres, which the law
gave me as an indemnification for my for
ukv beÂ»e6cce. Permit me to depolite oa
your table my formal renunciation of that
pension."
The Convention ordered this speech to
be inleited in the minutes.
Thursday, January 2.
Roberfpierre, jun. from Toulon, as
cended the tribune, and spoke as follows :
" You know the exploits of the loldiers
of the Republic. The capture of the Eng
lilh redoubt has decided the fate of Eu
rope. The enemy had exhausted all the
resources of art and genius to profit by it
Well, the defenders of liberty wanted to
take it, and they became matters of if."â
He now traced the pitture of the cruelty
of the Englifli, who threatened the patri
ots with cutting out their tongues, and
pouring.boiling lead into their brains, so
escape such cruelties, Bayle made away
with himfelf. Beauvais, who survived,
fuffered such fnocking treatment in his
dungeon, that the features of his face are
so much altered as to render it difficult to
know him again.â' 1 have now,' conti
nued Roberfpierre, ' to speak to you res
pecting the army of Italy, to which you
sent me. That army encamped on huge
rocks, in the midst of the snow, tar from
the woods, havirig every where frefh ob
stacles to conquer, and redoubts to carry,
flew, for these five months pad, from one
victory to another. Its valour has been
too little celebrated : too little lias been
said refpe&in'g the affair of Cillat, where
1000 Republicans, commanded by the
brave Dugomier, conquered 4QOO men,
and took 800 prisoners, and where a poll,
defended by too men, liood an attack of
12 hours againtt rooo assailants. That
army has not only the enemy to combat,
1 but it is also surrounded by thousands of
1 alLffins : The peasants kill our brave ibl
t diers, and instances of this kind are daily
[ renewed." Roberfpierre having informed
; the Convention that it had been the ene

By this Day's Mail.
NEW-YORK, April 10.
Letter from the master of an American ves
sel in Martinique, to his owner in this city.
St. Pierre, Martinique, March 20.
Sir,
" I HAVE but a moments time to inform
you, that the brig and cargo, was taken poS-
Session of by the Brit'lh men of war, when
this town was taken ; That we were all tak
en out, and while the vefiel was left without
a hand to take care of her, ihe was broke
open, and my chest containing upwards of
two hundred joes in dollar;, was robbed. I
was held a prisoner two days and then sent
on shore, and have not been allowed to go
on board since.
' " Their firft pretext For making"prizeÂ»
' of Americans, was the proclamation of the
6th of November, after the arrival of the
proclamation of the Bth of Jan. thsy Said,
that as the town was taken by aJTauk, all
r the property became the property of the aS
sailants ; but lately they have pretended, that
; tile port was blockaded when we entered:
- it appears to have been a strange blockade,
"t J 1
for I never saw a fail of any kind after I came
into the latitude of the Illands, till I was in.
St. Pierre road. However, I find they are j
dererrmn 'd to have them condemned, \vhe- (
tner r ght or wrong.
" I am informed, there is a court of ad
miralty formed, and toy present dete; mix
tion is to stay and lay in a claim for the pro
perty. They have stopped every neuLral
vclTei that has arrived since the town was
takfcn, I 'under the fame pretext, that the port
is still blockaded, altho' they have had full
poffelfion of the port and town, and in part
of the whole island except Fprt Royal and
Foijt Bourbon ever since the 17th of Febru
ary."
"I am &c."
By a person who came paflenger in the
veflei by which the above letter was received,
we are informed that a large ihip is provided
at St. Pierre for the reception of American
seamen j where they are fupp'ied with rati
ons : that fisty of their number have been
taken from the ftiips and diflributed in the
fleet: and that a number of American ves
sels have beeu cut from their cables by the
Britiih, and fuffered to drift to lea without
aman on board.
Yeiterday in the forenoon arrived here
from Boston, General Belgarde, and his
suiteâand in the afternoon, crossed the
Elizabeth-Town Ferry, on their way to
Philadelphia.
It appears by the Speech of the Britiih
King to the Parliament, that much stress
is laid on the successes of the allied powers,
â end-very little said about their late disas
ters. It seems the determination of the .
British Court to continue the war, as long
as they can amuse the people. Indeed
the threatened invasion of England by the
French, will unite the nation in opinion,
and give vigor to their arms. The Frensh
injure themselves more than the aims of
their enemies injure them ; for while they
defeat their external foes, and every where
triumph in the glorious cause of defending
their own Country from invaiion, they tar
nidi their glory By the barbarous and san
guinary puuifhments inflicted on their own
cjtizens who differ in opinion from the vi
olent Jacobins. The accounts of the ex
ecutions in that country wound the Feel
ings of humanity, and fill the reader with
horror.

We learn that the Commissioners for
fortifying this port, have finilhed their
plan, and that the great work of fortifying
will be commenced in a few days.

tured by the Britiih frigate Hermonine,
and sent into the Mole, where he was de
tained several weeks, and then liberated.â
He left at the Mole about eleven fail of

âto fail in 10 days after, for this port.
A Schooner belonging to Philadelphia,

A Gent'ermn lately froth Ringftori, ji
mrtica, informs, that he there saw Capt.
Barney â.*vho,though under binds walked
the ltreets dailyâthat he had converted
with him, artd that Captain Barney had
txpreffed himfelf in very f>o irited terms of
diiapprobation, when ipeaking of the
conduit of many American Captains,
wtiofe vessels had been capturedâthat
their language and deportment had beerl
very unjuftifiable on many occalions, and
had been attended with disadvantageous
confcquences, to themfefves and the pro
perty committed to their was
well known at Kingston, this gentleman
fays, that much fraud and plunder had ta
ken place on tlje part of some, who were
entrusted with the property 6f American
Merchantsâand though the fpoilationspf
our commerce, committed by many un
principled free-booters, acting under Bri- Â«.
tifh Commissions, had undoubtedly been
great, yet time would disclose many dif
graceful tranfaftions on the part of Cap
tains, who have bellowed the loudest a
bout insults and losses.
The paragraph in the General Advertises
of this morning, refpe&ing our mercantile
Representative in Congreis, carries with it
too much malevolence against that gentle
man, and is too entirely devoid of truth to
be pafied by unnoticed.
The Brig alluded to, was principally load
ed by a House in this Town, in conference
of an order âThey were directed to rtiake
â  the shipment whether the embargo t66k
place or not âand when her loading was
completed, which was on Thursday the 20th
ult. neither the owner or lhipper expected an
Embargo to take place. She failed oil the
Sunday following, from this port, and rcach
: ed Bombay-Hook, where {he was very im
properly, and illegally detained, by the Com
mander of a French armed (hip, for mqre
; than 20 hours âthe wind blowing then urvÂ«

Reedy-Island, where (he lay until the
