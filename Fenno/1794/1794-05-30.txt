A correspondent informs, " That the

ciety, chiefly composed of the swinish
multitude, for talking about Tar and Fea
thers at a late meeting, is for the prefect
quafh'd ! An eminent character of the
law, having given it as his opinionâ
" That uulefs the corpus of plaintiff was,
actually diverted of his

forcibly wrapp'd up in the American coat
of mail, with which, plaintiff was only
threatened, defendant would produce cause
of writ, which would occasion a non [urn

whieh otherwise would have crushed a re

WHITESTOWN, N. Y. May 14.
The following may be depended on as
fact : some boatmen were proceeding with
a boat load of fait and other articles, va
lued at 601. from the Onondago fait spring
to Niagara. While p. fling Fort Ofwego,
a detachment of Biitijh forces, stationed at
that place, seized the boat and cargo, and
condemned them as a legal prize. The
owner of the property feized,obtained in
formation that a boat was difpatched.froia
[ Niagara, some time since, to Schenecta
dy, on the Mohawk River, by the fub
jecis of his Bi itanic majesty, for articles
to a confiderablc amount. Exasperated
at his usage at Fort Ofwego, he raised
party of men, and proceeded to the threarirer points where ttiey came a cross,
the boat be.onging to Niagara, on ks re
turn, with a cargo valued at upwards of
three hundred pounds; which they seized
upon as a reprisal of the property taken
from them at Fort Ofwego.
' We hear further, that the banks of
the rivers to the westward arc lined with
privateers, in wait for boats bound to Ni
agara, and other British fettlenients,
which they are determined to detain, not
only as reprisals, but as violations of the
embargo laid upon all vefTels in the ports
and harbors of the United States.

A Female Tobacconist.
From the General Aduert'tfer.
From good authority we can Rate that
Mr. Monroe of the senate was nominated 1
yesterday to succeed Governeur Morris as f
minilter to the republic of France. The real
friends of their country will no doubt rejoice
that the important trust of drawing closer
the ties which unite the filter republics
Ihould be placed in hands so worthy the
confidence of republicans. 1
The following remarks on the above para
graph, were omitted yesterday for want
of room.
A correspondent congratulates the Prep.-
dent on having at length done something to
merit the approbation of the party.
A paragraph in yesterday's General Ad
â¢vertifer announces the nomination of Mr
Monroe of the Senate in terms of high pane
gyrick, as tending' to cement our ties with
France, by placing the trufl in hands so wor
thy of the public confidence : the paragraphia
is silent as to the circumstance of taking a
member of the Senate to fend on a foreign
Embajy, and the Very member who (report
fays) was among the molt opposed to Mr.
Jay s million, b.-caufe he was a judicial of
ficer. What must the public think of the
purity and patriotism which dictated so keen
an opposition in the Senate, in the Demo
cratic Club and in the paragraphs of the
General Advertiser, to Mr. Ja/s appoint
ment, on the ground of incomp atibilit y, and
which no* not only arqulefces in ijut even
â anrgjrife.j the appointment of Mr, Monroe ?
Is it not deoKMiftrable that it originated
entirely in party and factious views, and
t*r<s aor founded on public motives of na
tional expediency ? If it was a deviation
from the principiss of the Constitution to
take a judicial officer for an executive ap
pointment, was it less so to take a lcgifla
tive officer ? If the precedent was dange
rous in the one cafe, was it not equally so
in the other; it was said, the executive
might prevent an impeachment by remov
ing a judge whose influence, abilities and
enmity he dreaded ? Might he not resort
to this indirect mode or getting rid of a
troublesome oppufer of his measures in the
Senate? If there was an impropriety in
fending on a foreign embafly a judge, who
might eventually fit in judgment on a
'treaty, which he had formed, under the
positive directions of the President, is there
no impropriety in seleCting for that office
a member of a body, which determined th; t
there Should be such an office, and which
fixed the pay of the officer ? Wh-re then is
the consistency of those who clamored against
the appointment of the fudge and now ap
prove that of the Senator ? If there was
danger in one cafe, where the appointment
was only temporary and for a particular and
fpecified obje<!l, is not the danger enhanced
in the cafe of a permanent and general ap
pointment ? might not the circumstance of
lending a nomination for the fanition of the
candidates friends and intimates, and fellow
members, always influenced by the Esprit de
corps, be dwelt upon as a serious objection
by those disposed to cavil ?
The writer of the above, while he fees no
validity in any cf the above objeftkms, sug
gests them merely to attracS the public at
tention so the conduit of the party, to dif
pl .y in a strong cafe their views, and to ex
hibit the wonderful effedts of a fop to CerbeYus.
It mult occur to every pne who has watched
their motions, that had this honor been con
ferred on a person of opposite politics, a no
mination, whitli received an unanimous v6te
.in the Senate, would, as in the cafe of Mr.
Jay, have excited a tempest of three days
duration, would have been carried with dif
ficulty, would have filled columns of a party
paper with libellous insults and dirty infmu
ations against the President, the oificeV apt
pointed and the majority of the Senate, and
would even have roused the patriotic ardor

Several rumours were yesterday in cir

mignt have been, his excellency departs
re ir.faCta. Ihe cause is, however, obvi
oufiy to be found in the recapture of
j. fouioil, which extinguilhed the idea's of
t the British force in the Mediterranean,
and procured to the Freneh intereit the
ascendancy in the Divan.
_ Accounts have been received from Tu

Hood were in possession of Baftia, which
had surrendered to our forces. Calvi,

been acceded to. The accounts had just

tain an account of further discoveries
made with respeCt to the conspiracy, and
a full report (which will be found in the
Oracle) of the trial of Hcbert and his par
ty. The situation of Paris is tranquil,
and the discovery and destruCtion of the
conspiracy seem to have produced on the
part of the people an unanimous determi
nation to support the National Convention.
Baron Stael arrived about the middle
of last month at Copenhagen, for the ve
ry important purpose of negociating a
treaty between Sweden and Denmark,
for the protection of the Commerce of
the two kingdoms, and for the mainte

naval armament.
Letters have been received in town by
the Lord Mayor, and other persons, from
Jersey and Guernsey, dated the 28th of
March, which state, that the alarm in Jer
sey hadconfiderably subsided. The force
landed upon the Isles of Chauze amount
ed only to 2000 men ; the Carmagnole
frigate of 44 guns, had been wrecked up
on that island, but the crew were saved.
The circumstance of her firing a number
of guns of distress had occasioned part of
the alarm in Jersey.
From the Lower Rhine? March 24.
By various accounts we learn, that the
negociations of the King of Pruflia for
the provisioning of his army by the fix
neighbouring Circles have not succeeded ;
the elector of Bavaria and the duke of
Wurtumberg particularly exenfed them
selves, and were followed by various of the
other Circles; since which we have received
certain accounts that all the Pruflian army,
except the Contingent of 20,000 men, will
shortly march back to Cologne, and last
Thursday the ftadholder of Bonn arrived at
Cologne, to give notice to the chapter of
the approaching march of the Prussian
troops, and a Prussian officer is arrived
there to notify the fame to the magistracy ;
but as some arrangements must be made to
provide the troops with sustenance on their
march to Cologne, they will not march
from Mentz for some time.
The king of Prussia wrote a letter to the

On Saturday last, the enemy, in very
great fuice, attacked the Austrian advanc

lages ; but as loon as two battalions in the
rear moved forward with some cavalry,they
were repulsed with the loss of 584 men,
whose bodies were found.
On the 22d of March, three Prussian
regiments passed through Mayence, on
their return home, and large detachments
of horse and'foot from the Austrian army
under general Braun, have actually set out
to replace them.
By the information of the Captain of an

Our Frankfort correspondent's impor

The account of the surrender of Baftia

LAW REPORT.

This was an action to recover of the de
fendant the sum of iool. being his fub
'lf IÂ®*1Â®* to a P<?'icy of insurance on the
vessel Commodore Hood, at and from Fal
mouth to Swansea and back. The defen

their iubfenptions.

The love of power is the piedominating
pnffion ot mail.
Americans read of the persecUtion? of
Nero and Domitian with horrorâThey
fbudder at the recital of the tortures in
flicted on heretics in Europeâthe rackâ
iinprifonmentâflames and death -They
wonder the Pope, priests, and princes can
punifll men for their faith âfor not be
lieving the floftrines of the dtablilhed
church.
But look at homeâmutato nomine, de
fe fabula narraturâonly change names,
Popes into democrats; and heretics in mode
rate federal men, vulgarly tailed ariflocrats,
and the fame femes are hatchingâthey
are in embv'yoâand nothing (granting but
a little more power in the party, to revive
all the horrors of perfecuti Already the
incendiaries, the Catalinps of America
threaten vengeance upon their eppofersâ
rot only in private converfatioii, but in
the public papers, the friends of peace,
ind the fnpporters of our government are
menaced with terrible Vengeance. This
is the fame perfecting difpolition, which
has deluged the world in blood for con
science fakeâand whether religion or go
vernment is the pretext, one part of man
kind are eternally quarelling with the other
about their opinions; eternally endeavoring
to make all others think and believe like
themfelvcs.
" Man's third for power," fays a cele
brated I'Vcnch philolopher, " is insatiable.
Not content with commanding men, he
would command their spiu'ms also. He
is as anxious to subdue the reason of his
fellow citizens, at fume eastern despot is
to usurp the provinces or the treasuries of
his neighbors." Just so is the fad in A
merica ; and private clubs, under a pre
text of Republican fm, are attempting to
controul public measures, and threaten
the men who are of opposite sentiments.
" Man," â  lays the fame writer, " does
not fhink lumfelf truly matter of others,
if he does not bring their minds into fub
jligation. To effect this he employs
iOicc ne at length lubdues reason. Men
are completely degraded by believing opi
nions thsy ai*e forced to profefs. What
reafpning begins, isfinifhed by violence."
Wh i does not fee these truths verified in
America, where men are burnt in effigy
' for their independence of mind.â
In tjjÂ£_uaniÂ£ .tÂ»f couimoii sense, let me
ask 1 hat is the difference, between a
French King's ifluing Lettres de Cachet,
: or banishing a man for his opinions, and
a mob hanging a man in effigy for the
fame thing ? The names and the persons
are changed, but the violence and the ty
ranny are of the fame species, differing
only in degiee. It is a violence offered
to freedom of opinion'âa in France
and a Mob in Ameiica have committed
equally an outrage oil the liberties of
ethers. It is an atttempt to subdue opi
nions, the right of winch is sacred and
inviolable. When Roufleau and Voltaire
pubhfhed opinions that the King of France
or the Dodtors of the Sorbonne did not
like, they.conspired to destroy the mtiw
and exile was their portion. When a
Smith of an Ames, as honest men un
quediona.ily as ever lived, publish opin
ions that a cahal of mock patriots do not
like, the junto confpirc to disgrace them
â  they tin eaten, and only want the pow
e., to inflict on them the moit summary
vengeance. Is this a land of freedom J
Is this the reign of republicanism, when
law and not despotic â nvill and pajfion, is to
govern ? Gracious Heavens ! Let me ra
ther liv? tinder an Eastern Rajah, than
linder the despotism ot a mob !

NEW-YORK, May 26.
On the night of Saturday the 18th in
<mt, there was, in some parts of the coun
ty, e more fevcre frolt than has been, for
many years, known at the fame season.
I lirough Columbia county in this state,
a ' lo northward through Renfaellaer
and Albany counties, its are very ,
Ni lble and calamitous. Moll kinds of gar
den vegetables, every fort of fruit, great
quantities of peas, flax, oats, wheat and rye
ai e tftroyed. Some farmers have plowed
t ie 4 r Lax for a second sowing. Many 1
'e s: of wheat on the Pitch Pine Plains are ;
wholly turned yellow, and the wheat is
''ppoftu to be totally' killed. In more I i
eitva -ed situations, the leaves only of the
wheat and oats appear to be affected, i
Throughout the counties above mentioned
the small oaks, hickory, chefnut, and some
other kinds of trees arc killed : at leafl the
leaves are as dry as in the winter. In forne
parts of Reniellaer county, efpeci ally new
Hoofack river, the oaks, Handing detach
ed from forefls, many of them 60 or 70
feet high, have not a green leaf remaining.
Fo the southward of Columbia county the
frofl was lighter. Through Dutchafs
county and to this city the wheat and
much of the fruit has escaped. To the
eastward from Narwalk to Hartford, we
are told, the effeÂ£ts of the froft are vi iibfe.*,
but not severely injurious: further east
ward towards Boston, the damage done fs
very great.

Says a CorrefpondeM.
A schism, among the powers combined
against France wa: early jvedi<sted.
Independent of the natural principles
Which repel the component parts of such an
aflbciation from forming a lasting combina
tion, many persons suppose that at the prc
fent day, there is less good faith and honesty
of motive in the condua of the persons in
verted withthepowers of government in the
European world, than at almolt any prece- I
ding period.
Hence they fay it is a very easy thing
to account for the secession of the king of
Prussia from what has been denominated a
common cause among the crowned heads
If Frederick has entered into the war from
meer motives of speculation and profit,
the present appears the molt favorable
moment for him to make an advantageous
bargainâand it is not probable that the
allies conjointly, will be able to make him
so advantageous an offer, as 'the french.
One million and peace with France, would
probably be better than fix, to continue
in the war, provided he can prefcrve hi
I j dominions frofri the attacks of any of tie
! powers, who may take umbrage at his
feceflion. i
T he preceeding remarks are predicated
tfn this ideaj that the interference of the
King of Pruflia in the war, was founded
on mercenary principles altogetherâand
in truth many cii ctrmftartees in the eourfe
of events haveferved to confirm this sup
: position. It is pretty evident that Dumo
rier by his address, diverted Frederick at
a critical moment, and induced him to
' make a retrograde motion from the line of
cOnquelt. On that occasion it is highly
probable that a golden shower dazzled his
opticsâ in succeeding tranfaftions, the
Prussian Army has appeared to ast fome
tirnes as if it had a separate and independ
ent object in viewâat others as if indiffer
ent to the i(Tue of the contest. Perhaps
after all,the real motives of the feceflion
of Frederick are not yet developed; fliould
it turn out that His people are forming
donieftic plans of revolution, he may find
it necessary to go home, left while he is
attempting a counter-revolution abroad, he
may lose what he has left behind,
A letter from Cape Henlopen dated on
Tuesday morning lail, has a poftcript which
fays, that two frigates were then seen off
the Capes, but were at such a distance, that
it could hot be determined what nation they
belonged to.
For the Gazette of the United States
ANECDOTES of Anacharfis Cloots.
This extraordinary character lately guil
lotined at Paris, diitinguithed himfelf si rc m I
the earlielt period of the revolution : *
Prussian by birth and celebrated for his
philosophic researches, he was invited into
trance, where it does not appear that he
ushered himfelf into public notice, till the
appearance of some periodic.'l worksâ
m,, e admired for breathing the true spirit
ot liberty, than from the singularity of his
itile, which was little relished, being too
laboured and dogmatic for the refined taste
of a Frenchman :âthere was a mixture of
folly and wisdom in this man's a&ions, and
he leemed to pride himfelf on his eccen- ''
tricity. He called himfelf V orateur du
genre buma'tn*âthe orator of the human race,
and adtually picked up in the streets a naÂ»
tive of every country in the universe that
were to be found in Paris. He preceeded
this odd assemblage to the National CorK
vention, and in a pompous speech of some
length addrefied the Convention. His fo
reign accent was so uncouth, that he excit
ed the rilibiiity of the members, which
they ftifled, when he annonced to them
his new title, and prayed the humanity of
the nation ;n behalf of his fellow fojurners
who probably, added he, are driven from
their refpeftive countries by the hand of
tyranny and seek an afylmn in a land of
liberty. He was universally applauded,
and it was deceed, that all people without
diflindtion of color or nations putting
tliemfelvcs under the protection as France
fliould enjoy the fame privileges as French
citizens.
He had formerly received a flattering
letter from the PrufTian Monarch's own
hand, accompanied with a golden medal
as a reward for some work of merit; at
the time when the people were making
public, offerings of money, plate, jewels,
&c. he presented the royal medal, and
begged't might be immediately cast into
the crucible ; and after having read aloud
the letter,^ he indignantly tore it and Mat
tered the pieces in the air, looking round
with exulting triumph.
This and other proofs of patriotism,
made him very popularâand soon after
we fee him seated as a National Repre
sentative at the fame period with Tho
mas Paine.
The Convention anticipated much from
the labors of those two celebrated cha
ractersâbut the intrigue and violence of
party soon fucceding, we hear no men
tion made of either, till the feceflion of ;
Thomas Paine, and the conspiracy for
which Anacharfis Cloots was co ndemned,
and executed.

ANECDOTE.
A few evenings ago, a gentleman called
to fee his friend, who is a member of the
Democratic Society ; being told by a coun
try servant, that his matter was abroad, the
gentleman asked where he was gone, to
which the servant innocently replied, that he
was gone to the demon-Jrantic club ; where
the ( deuce; is that, said the gentlema* ? I
don't know, replied the servant, but I have
heard matter fay, that it was a kind of Ne-ut
Congrcfs to fettle the affairs of the Nation.
In the Canton of Berne in Swiflerland,
there is a peculiar institution, which in some
measure resembles the Democratic Societies
of this country. It is a miniature kind of
government, a mimicry of that of the Canton.
It consists of the fame Denomination of ma
gistrates, councils and afiemblies as the go
vernment itfelf js it has no authority by law,
but the magistrates and councils aflemble at
stated periods and deliberate on the Tame
questions as the government.âThe offices
are filled by young men, who are thus trained
up to business ; the arrrfs of the Republic of
Berne are a Bear, those of this mock govern
ment, a Moukey, indicative of their mimicry.
It is recommended to our api/h institutions
to afTume the fame arms ; and it would not
be amiss if the Bear was afloeiated with the
Monkey.

The Public are cautioned to
beware of counterfeited Five Dollar Bills oj
the Bank of the United States, and Twenty
Dollar Bills of the Bank of North America,
several of wnich have appeared in circulation
'within a few days pajl; they are a good ge
\ neral imitation of the genuine Bills, but may
be dijlinguijhed by the following
T marks.
Five Dollar Bills of the Bank of the
United States.
ALL that have appeared liavz the letter F.
For their Alphabetical Mark-
The Texture of the Paper is thicker and
whiter and it takes the ink more freely than
the genuine paper. â .
The O. in ihe word Company is smaller
than theM. and other letters of that word,
to that a line extended from the top of the ,
to touch the top of the JVL would extend eon
fiderably above the range ot the whole word.
In the word United the letters are narrow
erand closer together than the reft of the bill
The iand /in the word promise are not
parallel, the '/inclining much more lorward
than the i.
The engraving is badly executed,the strokes
of all the Letters are stronger and the devi. e
in themargin particularly ismuch coarler and
appears darker than in the true bills. Some
ot the counterfeits bear date in 1791 Where
as the Bank was not in operation till Decern
ber, and no five dollar bills were iflueu in
ihat year.
Twenty Dollar Bills of the Bank of North
America.
ALL that have appeared the letter
B tor their alphabetical mark.
They are printed 011 a paper nearly similar
to that of the Five Dollar Notes
above described ; the engraving is beUe. exe
ucted, and they approach ncaier to the ap
pearance of the genuine bills.
The fine ruled lines through the word lu.cn
(l, in the body of the bill, are in number th
teen in the genuine b:lls, and but twelve in
the counterfeits.
The word Company is much like the lame
word in the Five Dollar Bills as described a
bove, the 0 being less than them, and others
following. . , ~ ,
There is no stroke to the t mthe word North
whereas in the genuine hills the stroke is well
defined. .
The letters ent in the word Twenty, to tne
left hand at the bottom, do not come down tp
the line, but are so cut as an irregular
appearance to the word, the ifw and the;' go
ine below them.
The fignatute J Nixon, has the appear
ance ol being written with lamb-black aoii
oil, and differs Irom other inks used in
printing the bills and the cafhiei's fignatnre.
It is luppoled thele forgeries were committed
in some of the Southern State*, a* ail Ihe coun
terlcns that hove appealed, have come irom
thence, and two perloiis have been appiehend
ed in Virginia, on suspicion ol being ihe author
of them. _ _ 4_ _

otFeuders ot the following descriptions or any
ot them, viz.
The pei Ton or pcrfons, who manufactured
the paper on which the Bills are primed.
The perion or petfons, who engraved the

They may be "diftinguiftied from the genu
ine by the following MARKS :
The papaj of the counterfeits is of a more
tend r texture aud gloffey furface than the
genuine, and there is 110 water mark in them.
Tlae letter C. in the word Caftiier, in the
true bills is strongly marked, whereas in the
counterfeits, the whole letter is a fine hair
stroke, evidently in an unfinifhed state. The
letter in the word demand, is badly formed
and the whole word ill done, and there is 110
comma at the end of rt, as there is in the
genuine bills.
The marginal device, is much daiker in
the falfe, tlmn in the owing to
the lhade strokes being coarser, much nearer
together, and consequently much more nu
merous. This difference strikes the eye at-lirft
ni&thtf
view,
The fame reward of ONE THOUSAND
DOLLARS, will be paid for apprehending, &
prosecuting to con vision the several above
described Offenders in refpe& to this, as to
the last described bills.

THE grand principle of Equality, if right

universal justice. lac red order, and perfect
freedom, can be firmly built, and permanent
ly feeured. The view of it exhibited in this

the outrages of opjireflfon ; confirm#, in the
riioft forcible manner, the neceflity of subor

thority. So far indeed, from loosening the
bands of ibciety, that it maintains inviolate,
every natural and every civil diftinftion,
draws more clo'ely every social tie, unites in
one harmonious and justly proportioned fyf

ground of the inherent l ights of human na
