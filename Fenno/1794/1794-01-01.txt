TO THE PUBLIC.
THE undernamed committee, appoin'cd by
" THF SOCIETY for the INSTITU
TION 7 and SUPPORT of FIRST-DAY or
SUNDAY SCHOOLS in the city of Philadel
phia and the diftrid of Southwaik ar.d the
Noithern Liberties," to solicit further fubferip.
tions for the support of the schools which the
fatd society have eftablifbed, take the liberty to
represent to their fellow citizensâ
Thai, although the school* were fufpendM
during the period of the late awftjl calam-ty
with which our city and suburbs have been af
fl ded. thry are now again opened for she free
admifCun and education of ooor children.
That, the neccflity and reafona for the eflab
liflimen' of these schools arc increafcd, frOm the
ctrcumftance of the late diftrrfs having left a
number of Orphans deilitute of all the means
of education, save what the hand of benevolence
mav administer.
Thar, former experience has, most pleafinply,
verified the fondrft hopes ot the friends of this
institution, with regaid to the p'ogre f s arul ad
vancement of the children, who have heretofore
bern under its care, in the ufeful branches of
education which it has afforded. Referring to
this faâ¬t, and to the address to the public, on
this fubje&, publiftied in the newfpaoers of this
city Â»n the third month last, when about eight
hundred and twenty children of both sexes had
partaken of the benefits afforded bv the society,
and about thrre hundred and twenty more were
th-n a&ually receiving inftru&ion in their
schools, it now only retrains to be observed,
that the funds of the focirty are greatly ineffi
cient to carry on their brnevolent defipm, and
that the committee formerly appointed to folicti
fubferiptions, conceived it necefTary to decline
their anpltcations to their fellow-citirens for
their afliftance in favor of these schools, in order
that theie might be no intenuption from th-m
to the solicitations then made in behalf of their
unfortunate brethren from Cape-Fraocois.
The public aid is now therefore eamcfUv fÂ«>-
licited to support a charitable eflabliihment, cal
culated upon the principles of public and pri
vate pood. The annual fubferipuon for a mem
ber is but One Dollar; and it is presumed that
so fmali a sum per annum cannot be better dis
posed of, by those who can afford it, than by
bestowing it as the price of the diffufion of ufelu!

OBSERVATIONS
RIVER POTOMACK,
The Country Adjacent, and the
CITY OF WASHINGTON.
THE permanent feat of government of
the United States, having been fixed cn the
river Potomach, by a solemn aS of the go
virnment âThis river, the country about it,
and particularly the spot chosen for the feat
of government, become objeds of interefling
enquiry, both at home and abroad.âThis
confederation has drawn the fallowing ob
servations from a person who, to a general
knowledge of the Potomack and its dependen
cies, adds the advantage of having been long
in a Jituation, where he has had an opportu
nity of obtaining the befl informatiou on the
points mentioned in the following Jbeets.
THE river Potomack forms a jundhon
with the bay of Chefapeak, one hundred
and fifty miles from the sea. From thence
to the head of tide-water is about one
hundred and sixty miles.
â¢' This river is seven and an half miles
Â»'ide at its mouth ; four and an half at
Momony Bay ; three at Aquier; one and
an half at Hollowing-Point; one and a
quarter at Alexandria ; and the fame from
thence to the city of Walhmgton, which
is within three miles of the head of tide
water.âlts foundings are seven fathoms
at the mouth ; five at St. George's Island;
four and an half at Lower Matchodic ;
three at Servan's Point, and the fame from
thenee to the city." [Mr. Jefferfon''
Note 6 on Virginia.]
From the Capts of the Chefapeak to
the city of Washington, is upwards of
three hundred miles; but the navigation
is easy and perfectly fafe.â * A veflel of
twelve hundred hogsheads of tobacco has
loaded at and failed from Alexandria, and
one of seven hundred hogsheads at George-
Town, which is above the city.
At the city the water rises four feet in
a common tide.
From the city of Walhington to Cum
berland, a flourirtiing town at the head of
the river, is about two hundred and thirty
miles as the river runs.
Early in life General Washington con
templated the opening of this river, from
tide-water to its source, so as to make it
navigable for such veflels as were suitable
for carrying the produce of the country
to the (hipping ports below. His public
employments in the part of the country
through which the Potomack and its
branches run, had given him a more com
plete knowledge of this river, than almost
any other man poffefled at that time ; and
his mind was strongly imprefled with its
future importance. But the period for
undertaking a work of such magnitude
had not yet arrived The country was
then but sparsely inhabited.âCanals and
Locks but little understood, especially in
America ; and but few men of property
were willing to engage in an undertaking,
the cost of which they could not clearly
calculate, and the profits of which were to
many doubtful.âGeneral Walhington,
I however, kept the object steadily in view,

waiting until time and cirrumftances {hould
enable him to bring it forward, with a prof-
peel of success,
Tne tvar with Great Britain took place
about the time when the importance of
this object began to be understood, and a
villingnefs to embark in it began to appear
among men of property. Until the close
of that war nothing, however could be
attempted iti the business.âBut no soon
er had a happy termination of it enabled
Gen. Wafl.ington to retire from his high
public station, than he refumcd this object
which had so long before occupied his
mind. He found gentlemen cf the firft
property and refpeftabiiity in the neigh
borhood of the Potomack, both in Virgi
nia and Maryland, ready to engage in the
enterprise. Ia the year 1784 a company
was formed for the purpose of removing
the obftruftions, and opening the naviga
tion of the river from its source down to
tide water, and an ast of incorporation,
pafled by the assemblies of Virgihia snd
Maryland, authorizing the company to
take the neceiTary measures for carrying
into effect the objects for which they were
incorporatedâand granting to them for
ever the tolls which may arile therefrom ;
which tolls are fixed by the fame law that
empowers the company to undertake the
business. The sum agreed upon to com
plete the navigation was 50,000!. sterling,
divided into 500 (hares ot iocL each, to
be paid by such inftahnents, and at such
times, as the Directors of the Company
(hould find necefiary for the prosecution of
the work. Ten years were allowed the
company to fettle the business.
G. J.
The company have prosecuted their
work with great success, and what is not
common in undertakings ef tlus nature,
they will complete it for fomsthing less
than the sum fubferibed. The rate of toll
being fixed, and knowing with some accu
racy the quantity of produce that is now
brought by land from these parts of the
country, which will of course, throw the
fame upon the river, they have a certainty
of receiving, cn the firft opening of the
river, a handsome per centage on their ca
pital, (even without calculating upon the
articles which will be sent up the river,)
and the increase will be almost incredible.
Those who best know the circumstances of
the country, and some, who are not among
the moll sanguine with refpccl to the pro
fits of this undertaking, have no doubt
of the capital's producing fifty per cent,
annually, in less than ten years from the
time of the toll's commencing.
The principal work in completing the
above mentioned navigation, is at the
Great Falls, fourteen miles above the city
of Washingtonâat the Little Falls, four
miles above the said city, and in clearing
the river between these two Falls. At the
Great Falls, the water falls 72 feet in 1 mile
and halfâand at the Little Falls 36 feet
8 inches in about two miles.âAt the for-
mer there will be fix, and at the latter
three locks. The locks at the Little Falls
will be finitlled this season, and fit for use ;
those at the Great Falls are in forward-
nessâand, with clearing the bed of the ri
ver between the two falls, will be completed
next year. This will finifh the navigation
of the main river, from Cumberland down
to tide-water, and enable the Company to
receive the reward ot their expesfe and la
bor. Boats, carrying from one hundred
and fifty to two hundred barrels of flour,
already pass from Cumberland to the Great
Falls; and many thousand barrels of flour
have actually been brought in boats to the
latter place during the present year.
Bcfides the main river of the Poto
mack, its numerous and extensive branches
offer the prafpeft of transporting to the
main river, and from thence to the ship
ping ports, an immense quantity of pro
duce.
The following are the principal ftrramx
which empty into the Potowmack, shove
tide-water, and the distances to which
they are navigahle in their natural (late,
from their conflux with the Potowmack.
R.Patterfon's Creek, which sal& Into {lie
river ten miles below Cumberlaud, is i?i
vigable twenty miles above its mouth;â
The South Branch, seventeen miles below
Cumberland, is navigable one hundred
miles ; âConnogocheque, ninety miles be
low, is navigable twenty-iQur miles;âO
pecan, one liuiidred and miles
below, is twenty-five miles from
its mouth, and within a few miles of Win
chester, which, after Lancaster, is the larg
Tlic Shannandcah, one hundred and thir
ty mil-s below, runs into the country at
right angles from the Potowmack, nearly
two hundred miles, and the navigation of
it, for one hundred and fifty miies of that
aiftance, ii but little interrupted j the
chief obftrudHon is, where it enters the
Potowmack ; and, so trifling is that, com
pared with the great advantages of this
noble branch, that its removal and clearing
other parts, will not cost more than twen
ty-five thousand dollars. The Potowmack
Company have aheady made a beginning
on this work.âThe Monocofy, one hun
dred and fifty miles below Cumberland, is
navigable thirty miles above its mouth.
This branch is within two miles of Frcde
rick-Town, in Maryland, one of the larg
elt inland towns in the United States.*
These several streams, as well as the
main river, paf3 through a country not
exceeded in fertility of foil and salubrity
of nir, by any in America, if any in the
world; and few parts of America can
boast of being equally healthy with the
banks of this river, and the adjacent coun
try.
* Report of the committee appointed
by the Merchants of Georgetown and Al
exandria, which, being founded on the
actual observations made by order of the
Directors of the Potomack eompany,may
be deemed authentic.
[to be continued.]
Mr. Fenno,
Please to publilh the following paflage
from a piece signed Plain Truth,
which appeared in a morning paper.
" ON the late thanksgiving day, ap
pointed by the Governor I went to two
or three diffenent places of worlhip, during
the course of the day and evening, and
found myfelf grieved to find but one among
the whole number of preachers I heard,
whose discourse abounded with liberality
and'jufticeâHe, with a degree of can
dour that will do him honor, ingeniously
declared that it is not in our power to
scan the ways of omnipotence or pretend
to determine for what particular crime he
had thus punished us! and that it was
actually presumption in us to pretend to
know the purposes of him that sent it.
How many others acted with equal ho
tfefty in their discourses, I will not pretend
to determine, tho' I hope they were nu
merous, but this I can fay that there were
some who did not. It was that day de
clared from the pulpit, that the Theatres
were the chief cause of the late calamities,
and ought to be immediately abolilhed,
and every argument that designing sophis
try could use, was exerted to efl?& their
purpose, by rousing every latent spark of
superstitious prejudice and ignorance that
had laid dormant for these centuries part,
and bringing forth all that ancient venera
tion and implicit obedience, for the clergy
that were once entertained for them in an
rarly day of clouded ignorance and error.
Their delign no doubt was to gain such
an ascendency over the minds of the peo
ple as to enable them to acjomplifh their
present purpose, and succeed in any future
ones of a iimilar kind What their next
object would be, if they Ihould effect their
present purpose, we may very nearly tell
from this circumflance that one of them
in a fubfequrnt discourse clafled with the
Theatres, Balls, AfTemblies &c. among
the number of our fins, so that their next
step would be to suppress and destroy our
public Balls, Aflemblies, Concerts &c.
with every other reasonable recreation and
anuifement they could discover was prac
tifedby the citizens, in which they would
110 doubt be afiillcd by their good friends
the Quakers. How much farther itill,
they would procecd.with their dictatorial
authority can only be known to the unli
mited power of omnipotence.

From the American Daily Advertif;r.
A Correspondent who profefTes the love
of virtue wherever it is to be found, ac
knowledges his attachment to plain truth
when its views are to promote the general
benefit. Of this fort he begs leave v to
mention a " plain truth," which really is
of such a nature as is truly encouraging to
those of our fellow citizens, who hope
that a very considerable alteration for the
better amongst the people, will be the hap
py consequence of the late general cala
mity.
Our correspondent has heard it observ
ed, that the places of worihip are more
generally attended by survivors of the
sickness than they used to be previous to
that period, and from his own observation
refpe&ing the place which is usually atten
ded by himfelf, it is really remarkable,that
the feats of those who are departed,(hould
be so speedily occupied by others, in the
manner which is well known to hafe been
the cafe in many iuftances.
These are signs of feripus thoughtful
nefs, becoming a people, capable of re
membering an awful visitation, in which
perhaps there were but few families in this
great city, who have not sustained the
loss of valuable neighbours, beloved friends
or the cleared Relatives. In numerous in
itances, how peculiarly afFecting have been
these lofles ? Fathers, mothers, funs, and
daughters, are involved in them ; and that
they ought to impress our minds in a be
coming manner, is believed to be a senti
ment coinciding with the ideas of every
one, who in sincerity withes to promote a
reformation, which however desirable it
may be to the bed men, they would dis
dain to attempt to forward on any other
principled than thole which thev telle.v
to be confident with their proleilioiis of
religion, and their love of virtue ; whii h
mi-it include on all occasions a flui regard
to truth.
Our ccrrefpondent fays, that since writ
ing the above, the substance of a portion
of scripture imprefTed his mind in such a
manner,that he thinks there may be no im
propriety in the following quotation, be
ing beautifully descriptive of the true
chriltian character. "Ye are the light of
the world. A city that is set on a hill
cannot be hid. Let your light so shine
before men, that they may fee your good
works, and glorify your Father which is
in heaven."
To the Editor of the General Advert'ifer.
Sir,
The ilatement I made in your paper of
the sentiments of a member from Mafia
chufetts is to the best of my knowledge li
terally true, and for the truth of it I will
appeal to the members themselves and to
the citizens in the gallery. If I have er
red in the statement, it has been in that
gentleman's favor ; for he went farther
than I have suggested and said that " the
Executive had the right to withold its
communications, and that after they had
been entrusted to Congress confidentially,
Congress had no right to ast otherwise than
confidentially upon them."âSo far from
the speech having a tendency to vindicate
republicanism, it made an obvious impres
sion to the contrary, not only on my mind,j
but on the minds of a number present, witli
whom I conversed on the subject; the feiii
timents exprefied by that member were
not only hostile to republicanism itfelf, but
cast a reflection on Congress, the repre
sentatives of freemen.âlf the executive has
the right to keep Congress ignorant of
its tranfaftions, if Congress have not the
authority to ast upon communications
from the executive as they think proper,
the President is paramount to the people,
and Congress the mere creatures of execu
tive authority.
This is a change of sovereignty, and
may be within this gentleman's ideas of
republicanism ; but, I trust, will never
receive the function of the free citizens of
America,
GRACCHUS.

THOUGHTS
On InsuranceâCorporations, &c.
THE designs of those who wish to
obtain an ast of Incorporation of the In
surance company of North America, in
its prcfent state, may be perfectly proper,
as the institution is now in a very regular
way of bufmefe, and owned chiefly by the
merchants, who give employment to the
company.
Yet the neceflity of such application
does by no means exist at this timeâif as
it is every where confrjl, the form of their
policy may be made to answer the fame
purpose, by an addition of a single clause
onlyâStating that the a (lured agrees to
hold the capital flock of the companv,
fubjedl only for the payment of all lodes
incurred by the companyâand that the
company agree to abide by the event of any
suit recovered agninjl their President only,
as far as their capital Jlocl held in trujl
by the fa 'ul President, and the Secretary of
the society for th? purpose may extend, and
r.o further âAnd as the capital (lock is
thought to be, greater than can ever be
necelTary in the word of all poflible events,
it is presumed, that much more has been
said on the fubjeft of the incorporation,
than in the event it can be found to deserve.
I am told, that a member of the house,
proposed by way of answer to the mer
chants, that he would have an incorpora
tion on an entire new planâand open to
every body, or he would have none ; the
impropriety of such a plan, in such instan
ces, will ftrikc at firll view, whether this
<was said in contempt or not, is out of the
qucjlionâan insurance company cannot ex
ist, but by the aid of the merchantsâAs
this body of citizens have wen used to do
this business by way of exchange for each
other, they were averse to any company
for some time, but finding that the exit
ing company .as formed in part of mtr
tji; fuft infta c*. the reft have
lince bought in at an advanced premiumâ
line*'v.hi. h, thf: \alue of the stock hap
fallen upon their hands, to not more than
half tKc amotlnt of the par and premiums,
which will (hew that another company
cannot succeed, even iii the Jubfcription on
ly, unless this (hould be done by the igno
rant, and the unwary.âln the city of
London, there are but two (hip insurance
companies, and yet they have never been
able to divide more than three to five per
cent per annumâHow then can two be
supported in this*city? and how would
a man of principle feel, if after having
pafled a law to incorporate persons for
they scarce know what ? If the event
(hould be to injure as many, as in the in
(lance of the Canal Companies, &c. for if a
fubfeription was opened, thus in effect to
injyre the merchants, by an attempt to rob
them of their ancient rights of insuring
their own property, it could not succeed ;
it would be like a resolution of the house
to incorporate the brick makers by the
name of the Company of Tailors; and
the giving to every one a chance, thus
to injure the merchants would not be more
likely to succeed in the end, (as the power
must finally reft with the merchants to give
their business where they please) than if
the house were to fay that the brick mak
ers (hould in future make the wearing ap
parel for every citizen of Pennsylvania.

PROVIDENCE, December 2j,
Extract of a letter from a gentleman of e
minence in Philadelphia, to his firiend.
here.
A merchant in London writes, tlnit he
was present when a gentleman of the firft
mercantile character waited on Lord
Hawke(bury, on behalf of a considerable
number of the London merchants.âHe
told Lord H. that he came to him for an
explicit answer from government, as to i he
situation of public affairs between America
and England : That the merchants were
alarmed at the rumor of an expe&ed war,
and wished to hear from him the true state
of this questionâbecause, if such an event
was to happen, they ought to be put on
their guard, that proper steps might in
time be taken to protest their distant pro
perty, and future engagements. The an
swer given was, " \ou may make your
selves easy ; the government have not the
lead disposition to go to war with Ameri
ca, nor has America any interest or incli
nation to quarrel with us. While General
Washington is at the head, and the
friends to the Federal Government are the
majority, we fhail have no war with Ame
rica, you may depend. If any irregularities
should happen on either fide, discussion and
accommodation will take place."
" Other letters from London
with confidence of another campaign in
Europe. As to ourielves, I do not be
lieve we (hall have a war, Mr. Genet rwt

FALMOUTH, (Jamaica) Oift. 2
It is with unfeigned sorrow the Printer
communicates to the Public the following
melancholy fccne which took place at
Montego Bay, o:. Monday last, occaftn-â tremer.&Bous fwe.
*â ' 1
which'fet in suddenly the preceding day,
atid continued to increase to a degree un
known to the oldest inhabitant. The
particulars were received last night by a
letter from a gentleman who was a fuf
terer in this dreadful calamity, which
beggars description.
Â£ Four ships, 3 brigs, a snow, 2 schoo
ners, 3 Hoops, and seven fmalkr veflcls,
went on ihore, and mostly gone to pieccs ;
many lives were loft ; a number of build
ings down, and wharves torn to pieces.â
The whole of the lower part of the Bay,
from Smith's wharf to the east end of
Meagre Bay, is fcveral feet covered with
sand ; and large log;- of mahogany, fuftic,
&c. are bt'.r'.ed in it.]
Amidst the foregoing painful scene (if
diltrefs, which the Printer has occasion to
relate, it is a pleasure to mention the brave
and humane conduit of a iailor on board
the Langriflie who, when lhe struck,
threw a fmail line to'people on fnore,who
were drawn there by the cries of the
crew, to afford what relief they could:
A large rope was fattened by thsm tp it,
which he drew to the vessel and secured; by
means of this conveyance, upwards of
twenty people got on (hore ; the others
who remained were by this man, hfhed to
a fecord rope, and by this means laved :
he lastly came on shore himielf, when re
collecting an old foreigner, whole life had
been preserved by a dog on board the
Lar.grifhe, jumped overboard before she
parted, he swam off, and secured him :â
his last carc was directed to the faithful
animal just mentioned, whom this worthy
tar swore ihould not go to wreck after
saving the life of a human creature.
North-Carolina Legislature.
The committee on public bills, to whom
was referred the address of his Excellen
cy Richard Dobbs Spaight, Esq. Go
vernor, &c. &c.
REPORT,
That having had under their serious
consideration the said address : Your com
mittee have thought proper to submit the
following answer thereto :
SIR,
T H E communications which your
Excellency was pleafcd to make to both
Houfea ol the Legislature last Wednes
day, have been received with fatisfaftion
and will be acted ujion in the course of
the present feflion, with that deliberation
which is due to their nature and magni
tude.
Your efforts during recess to pre
serve the peace and neutrality of the Uni
ted States have not escaped public notice,
and the success with which they were
crowned ought to call forth our mofl fer
vent fuppiications to Divine Providence,
for the continuation of blessings so eflen
tial to our national happiness.
The pepple of the United States being
allied to the French by treaty and the still
more sacred ties of principle and gratitude,
we liave every reason to be allured that
our obligations to that republic will be
liberally conflrued and faithfully executed ;
But while the powers of construing and
performing such engagements remain ves
ted by the conflitution in particular de
partments, any attempt to influence their
decisions by threatning an appeal to the
public, would evince a mistaken estimate
of the character of a people who regard
order as the essence of civil liberty.
To pursue political happiness and glory
"by rational means is the right of even
nation ; and as individuals in full enjoyment
of those inestimable privileges which
Frenchmen now struggle for, we are con
strained, in obedience to the di&ates of
humanity, to wifli them complete success
âTo require more would be to require
this country to relinquish its neutrality,
its peace and with them its growing pros
perityâa facrifice not required by our en
gagements and not less incompatible with
the duties which a government owes to
its own citizens than with that liberality
and friendfhip which an enlightened peo
ple evidenced towards this country on try
ing occasions. Under these impressions
and with these sentiments we regard the
President's proclamation of the 22d of
April lafl, as a new proof of that pater
nal care and patriotic vigilance which have
so eminently chara&erized a life devoted
to the welfare of his native countrv.
Surmises, too often the result of rnifap
prehenfion or mistake, cannot abate our
confidence in the virtues of an officer whose
attachment to the cause of Freedom has
been equalled only by hi s exertions in its
:1 of the sea,
defence-âNor <Jan we too highly approve
the condutt of your Excellency in giving
efScacv and support to his injunftiona of
neutrality within the ilate of North-Caro
lir.a Such prompt attention to the
molt precious interests of the public, en
title you to the thanks and confidence of
vour constituents.

PHILADELPHIA,
JANUARY I.
Extradt from a letter written by a gentle
man in Lilbon to his friend in this city,
dated. 2-iil Odtober, 1793.
" As to politics I have only to tell you
in brief, that the arms of the combined ty
rants seem to carry every thing before
them again ft the alienors' of liberty in
Franceâand indeed, from the treachery
and corfufon which prevail in the Conven
tionâand you may fay, in every part of
that devoted countryâlittle else can be
expected. I hope America will be wife
enough to avoid having any thing to do
with war, which in its consequences would
certainly destroy all its profpech of happi
ness ; and yet it is suggested that the
Minister lately sent out to you from
France, went with the intention of bringing
you into itâat lead that it was one part of
his errand. I trust however he will fail in
his views, if any such he entertained ; for I
have a more exalted opinion of the wisdom
of the Americans, than to suppose they
will fuffer themselves to be fafcinated into
measures Jo dejlrudive of their true interest.
Col. Humphreys is at Gibraltar on his
way to Algiersâgone with the expedi
tion of accommodating matters in behalf
of America with those piratesâGod grant
he may succeed. 'Tis said the applica
tion for a convoy was rather in too lofty a
tone for this Court. Mr. Humphreys
is a man of superior talents, and more
pleasing mannersâas such he will always
fuccecd in obtaining favors, which the Mi
nister here will spurn at, when solicited in
an imperious manner.
General Galbaud is teturned to New-
York from his tour through Canada. He
calls upon the Miniiter of the French Re
public for a passage to France. This
would have been granted him long since
had he not taken himfelf off. In his let
ter to the minister he declares his inno
cence and denounces the National Com
missioners at St. Domingo and ininifter
here as criminal agents.
General Galbaud was appointed just be
fore the treacherous manoeuvres of Dumou
rier were executed, through the recom
mendation of Beurnonville, whose concern
with Dumourier is more than problema
tical.
He came out in the capacity of military
governor, or general of St. Domingo.
On his arrival, the civil commissioners re
presented to him that his appointment
was a violation of a national decree, which
declares, that no person poflefling proper
ty in the illand could hold an office there.
He apparently acquiesced, and embarks
ed for France on one of the ships of force
that were to convoy a fleet of merchant
veflels then nearly ready to fail.
As soon as he was embarked he tamper
ed with the officers and crews of the fleet,
attacked and was the cause of the confla
gration of the Cape and of the misfortunes
which have followed that catastrophe.
Part of the convoy arrived here and Ge
neral Galbaud on board. He and his a
gents were no doubt at the bottom of the
disturbances on board some of the ships of
force while they lay at New-York, and
perhaps he was the cause of the defedlion
of the fleet which failed upon, some secret
expedition. \et this is the man who ap
pears so anxiously felicitous to be tried by
his constituents in France, though he
judged it expedient firft, it seems, to try
his fortune in Canada. Ccn. Adv.

From a Correspondent.
The sentiment that the government re
sides in the people is not trueâthat free
government originates in,and emanates from
a majority of the people is the only repub
lican idea that can be reduced to practice
âbut this majority does not poflefs abso
lute powerâthe majority isasmuch bound

The revolutions of time, the fucceiiicu
of years, the progress of reason, the ad
vancement of science, the encrcaiing light
of civil liberty, and the appreciation of th=.
Rights of Mankindâall point the view,
of the calm and contemplative observer,
to a period of exigence, more splendid
and and too re congenial and ho
norary to human nature, than hath yet
dirtinguiihed the annals of the world-t-
But may we not rationally extend our

point where the designs of Deity mill be

" As further duties are suggested to

is that the objects of future tax

The tenth volume of the Encyclopedia.it
now pre fen ted to the public ; but as it makes
its appearance in an imperfect state, some ac
count of the reason of that imperfection Ihould
be tfiven. On the Bth of September last, the
Publisher had the misfortune of having bis
Printing-Office burnt down by a fire which
broke out in the neighbourhood, and a great
quantity of his printing materials destroyed,
and among other articles, the figuies, with
which he was printing the tables of lo
garithms, belonging to the prel'ent volume,
were melted down by the violence of the fire.
As a supply of these could not be immediately
obtained, he was under the neceflity bf pub
Hilling the volume without the e tables; but
hopes he /ball be able to publifli them with the
next volume which is now in considerable for-
wardnefs.
The Publisher embraces this opportunity of
expressing his grateful acknowledgments to
the generous public, for thb very liberal pa
tronage with which his undertaking has been
honored; at the fame time he takes the li
berty of representing to suCh of the Pubfcribers
as are in arrears, the indifpenfible ncceflity of
punctuality, both in taking up the volumes as
early as poflible after publication, and of pay
ing for them when taken. Many of the sub
scribers having got only one, two, three, &c.
volumes, and-teveral volumes remain vnp aid.
Thus the work hangs in all its different stages
from the commencement; and though the im
portance of a few dollars may be but a trifle
to the individuals, yet the accumulation of
tliefe trifles unpaid lays the Publisher under
very serious embhrraflment, and deprives him
of the use of many Thousands Â«>f Dollars which
at this time would be of very cflential service.
For these reasons the Publiflier finds himfelf
under the neceflity of recurring to the original
terms of publication, and in future no vo
lumes will be delivered but only to those who
take and pay to the time of publication.
