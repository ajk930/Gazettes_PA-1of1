TOWN-MEETING.
The Citizens of New-York having as
sembled yeftcrday, in the large room of
the Federal-Hall, purfaant to their ad
journment of Thutfday, 2 7thult. to dis
cuss the resolutions reported by their com
mittee. took them into confidenaion ;
and the fame being read, and afterwards
considered separately, and difcufled, were
unanimoujly agreed to,and applauded with
repeated cheers. The Hall,not withstand
ing the very stormy weather, was remar
kably crouded, and contained on a mode
rate estimate, 2000 citizens.
The unanimity and modeiation that
prevailed, afforded the highest fatisfac
tion to every friend to order ; while the
firm, but decent spirit of the resolutions,
can give no offence to any, but those
whose approbation freemen are not felici
tous to obtain. The citizens resolved that
their thanks should be presented to their
committee, and then departed with the
greatest order and decorum.
[Here follow the Resolutions.]
Resolved, That sovereign and indepen
dent nations, in cafe of war existing be
tween neighbouring or foreign powers,
have a right to declate their determination
to preserve a ltriÂ£l neutrality towards the
refpe&ive nations at war: that the fulfil
ment of treaties existing between either
of the belligerent powers, and the neu
tral nation, published and declared previ
ous to the existence of the cause of war,
ought not to be construed as a breach of
that neutrality, which they declare them
selves determined to observe ; and conse
quently, that the United States of Ame
rica, as a free, sovereign, and indepen
dent power, have a right, founded upon
the law of nations, to declare and pre
serve their neutrality, at the fame time
that they fulfill, with justice and integri
ty, previously existing treaties.
Resolved, That when either of the bel
ligerent powers interrupt filch neutrality,
so declared and persisted in, by committing
spoliation and depredation upon the pro
perty of such neutral nations or its citi
zens, they are guilty of a violent infrac
tion of the laws of nations, and an unjult
exercise yf their power; and therefore,
the capture for prize or condemnation of
the vefTels and cargoes of the citizens of
these "United States, not concerned in a
contraband trade, by either of the bellige
rent powers or their fubjetts, i 3 unjuftifia
ble, and an infringement on those privi
leges, which the citizens of an indepen
dent and neutral nation have a right to
exercise and enjoy.
R T I S E R.
[Whole A T o. 554.
Refolveri, That it is the opinion of this
meeting, that it is the duty of belligerent
nations to lefien the horrors of war, and
mitigate diltref*-, not only by permitting
neutral nations to remain in tranquility,
but to protect all their l.iwiul commcrcc
and navigation ; when therefore,they mul
tiply the evils of war without ncceffity, &
wantonly and in a piratical manner har
rafsthe pefions, or make prize of the pro
perty of nations or their citizens who are
at peace, and declare their intentions to
remain ip, thsy violate the laws of nations
the obligations of justice, of nature, and
of reason.
fmw4w
Resolved, That the making of veflels
or cargoes, the property of neutral na
tions or their citizens prize, or forcibly de
taining the fame, to the damag# and loss
of the owners, not being contraband, is
unjuftâand that full compensation andref
titution is due from the belligerent power
so trefpalfing, to the party injured, and
to the nation thus insulted, and ought to
be demanded of right, and if refilled, that
the neutral nation thus situated, is juitifi
able by the laws of uature and of nations
to Seek restitution, in any mode the molt
likely to obtain redress.
Resolved, That the conduct of Great
Britain since the treaty of peace with the
United States of America, has not been
conformable to the true intent and mean
ing of that treaty ; but on the contrary,
by withholding the posts on our north
western frontier, and keeping up a milita
ry establishment within our territory, the
government of Great Britain has violated
their national faith, and usurped the rights
of our people ; that the non-fulfilment of
tiiis part of the treaty, oil the part of
Great Britain, occasionÂ» very serious in
convenience to our country and govern
ment, particularly as fueh conduct lias a
tendency to keep alive the hostile spirit of
the savages, and impedes those measures,
which would produce on the part of our
government, pcace and tranquility to our
frontiers.
Resolved, That as far as the govern
ment of the United States have pursued
raeafures to effect the fulfilment of exist
ing treatyâto preserve its neutralityâ
and to obtain a restitution of property to
its plundered citizens, it is entitled to the
warmest approbation of the people. But
that the delays which have been experi
enced in procuring relief from the evils
complained of j however unavoidable on
the part of government; have been pro
ductive of great distress to the people;
and that every day that passes finds us left
prepared for decisive operations, becaafe
every day discovers a new faarifice to fo
reign rapacity ; and perhaps when forced
to the last means of redress, we shall be
found without (hips, without feamcn, and
be the poverty attendant on a ruined trade.
Resolved, That in the progress of the
important questions which at present en
fage the attention of, the Executive and
.egiflative Branches of the government
of the United States, it (hould to them
appear expedient to place the ports and
harbors of our country in a refpe&able
state of defence, capable ot placing us as a
nation, above the fear of injury, or the ap
prehensions of insult ; or to make any mi
litary or marine arrangements, which the
exigency of affairs may requireâThat the
citizens of New-York, jealous for the ho
nor, and willing to support the dignity
of their country and government, will
cheerfully submit to any tax (if the pre
sent revenues of their country are irtcom
petent) which in the wifdorn of their r~-
prefentarivrt may appear necessary to de
fray the expence attending the support of
our independence as a nation, the honor of
our flag, and the dignity of our country
and government.
Resolved, That the chairman of th's
meeting be direÂ£kd to fend to Mr. John
WattÂ«, the reprefeutative of the city and
county in Congress, the aforegoing resolu
tions, in which the sense of his conftituenti
in this meeting it expreflcd.Congress vj the United Stjtes.

Mr. Parker presented the resolutions of
several Towns and Counties, in the State
of Virginia, relative to the measures new
pending before Congress respecting- Com
merceâthe general import of which were
in favor of the principles contained in Mr.
Madison's Resolutionsâthese were read
and laid on the Table.
Thebill providing for fortifying the poits
and harbors of the United States was re
ported, read twice, and committed for to-
morrow.
The bill providing a naval armament
for the protection of the commerce of the
United States, was brought in engrafted
and read.
A motion was made to recommit it to
the committee of the whole house.
This motion was principally supported
on the ground of the feleft committee's
having deviated from the report of the
committee bf the wholeâwhich report
conncfted the ways and means of defray
ing the expence of the armament with
the details of the armament, whereas the
bill contains 110 such c'timateâfor the
fake therefore of order and regularity in
conducting the public business it was said,
it is proper to agree to the motionâlt
was further observed, that no injury could
pofiibly result from a ihort delay, equal
to what would be the cur, Sequence of sanc
tioning such a flagrant deviation on the
part of the felefl: committee from the ef
tablilhed rules of the houseâThat it was
quite a new thing to drive a business of
such magnitude with such impetuosity
thro' the house. '
In opposition to the motion it was iro
nically observed, that as the carrying trade,
and the trade to the mediterranean
were of so triflng importance, it was real
ly Surprizing that the business of providing
a protection for the commerce of this coun
try, exposed at this moment to the depre
dation of the Algerines, (hould be hurried
with so much impetuosity, thro' the house
âthree months have already elapsed,
great part of which this fubjeft has been
under considerationâto steer clear there
fore of impetuosity in conducing the bu
siness, three months more ought to be fuf
fered to pass before any thing is doneâ
With refpeft to the conduct of the fe
left committee it was said that in the iirft
difcuilion of the fubjeft the report was
objected to on account of the ways and
means being connected with itâto remove
this objv&ion the bill was reported in the
form before the house.
The motion being put for rccommft
tingâit pafled in the negative, 48 to 41.
The hcufe then proceeded to fill up the
blanksâln the course of filling up the
blanks, the opposition to the bill was re
vived on old and new groundsâthe fiift
were, on account of its incompetency to
the objeftâconfidcring the resources of
the Algerinefâand the flipenor policy of
having recoiirfe to negoci.ition, and pur
chase of a peaceâthe new ground wns de
rived from rec;nt confidential communica
tions, from which it was inferred that the
.eligibility of tfie mode of pvocuring' a
pcace by purchafc was greatly ftrength
cnedâFrom this view of the 'iiibjeti, a
tranStion was made to the fubjfft of na.
vies generallyâin which the bad ponfe
quences qonnefted with their dlabjjfliment

I heard from you ; but hope you will be
this way Ihortly from Toulon.
The Algerines, in their October expe
dition, captured 10 fail of American
vefTels ; g of them have fafely arrived.
The crews of tfiofe 10 veJTels, amount
ing to 102 men, are at present in Algiers,
experiencing what we have fuffered for
upwards of 8 years.âl have repeatedly,
for the r e five years part, forewarned the
United States of the impending danger ;
for the Portug use have been trying a
long time to effect a peace with Algiers;â
but the Americans in genjral would put
but little confidence in the assertions of a
poor victim captive; but they now find
that they contained the truth.
On the nth instant, Mr. Humphreys,
the ambaflador for Algiers, sent hither a
con. ier to obtain the Dtfv's p,-i million to
come hither in order to make a peace.
The Dey answered, that he would not re
ceive him, either to make peace or redeem
the American (lavesâthat he had been
soliciting the Americans to come and make
a peace with this regency for three years
palt, and they had treated his proporti
ons with neglect and indifference ; and
that finci he had made a truce with the
Dutch and Portuguese, and captured 10
fail of Americans, and like to take many
more, he could not and would not make
peace with them : That he had made the
truce with Portugal for thepurpofc of cap
turing American vefTels, and could not
therefore be at peace with all the na ions.
The courier returned to Mr. Humphreys
at Alicante with the Dey's replyâbut
we have heard nothing more since.
The terms preferred by the Dey for
the reliefof the Portuguese, is as follows:
1,200,000 Mexican dollars for thetreafu
r;r; 600,000 dollars for the Dey's voice
and the great officers of the regency, am.
bafiadorial and consular prefcntsâequal
to what Spain gave ; and the redemption
of 7 J Portuguese captains at 2000 dol
lars each. On the 7th instant, the Portu
guese frigate failed from Algiers for Lis
bon with the Dey's propositions.
The day following, the Dey called
for Captain Logic, and desired he would
immediately write to Portugal, and in
form that he demanded for his family and
friends 600,000 dollars in addition to the
terms above exprefled.
The A!; serine politicians are of opini
on that Portugal will not agree to the
Dry's demands; but, fir, I think they,
w.ll, as they wirti to extend their com
merce, and well know the difficulty of
blocking l: p the Streights, and the vafV
Aims they expend in keeping up the fleet*
the Barbary states.
I enclofc to your care tjhe letters of the
Cr.pt :i:ns, who desire me to <%t>k you for
your kind offer. I a lift, as
c(,rreÂ£l as my situation w3l admit of.
Please to make this public. A camp on

The (hip Mary, of Philadelphia, Cap
tain Henry Stevens, brig Marvann, of
New-York, Cnptain Ebenezer Rofleter;
Clip Friendlhip, of Baltimore, Captain
Smith - r the two former expected to fail
tinder convoy of a Portuguele frigate that
at Cartl'.a going down to Gibral
tar, and were all ready for sea ; waiting
only for the motion of the frigate : The
latter had two-thirdsof her cargo on board,
*>t being difeharged, having performed a
quarantine of 20 days; but expedled to
be ready for sea by the latter end of Ja
nuary j and if there was no profpeft of
getting a convoy, the Captain was- deter
mined to run it dawn the linl gale of Eas
terly wind.
The Captain further informs, that
there is no conlul eitabliflied at Carthage
na by Congress ; notwithllanding which
they did nut want for a (ulcere friend,
whom they found in Mr. Henry Hawfon,
merchant of Carthagenaâhe tranfatted
all tlieir business in the b(I manner; made
out their memorial and forwarded it to
Court, took the utmoli pains to obtain
information concerning the Algerine cor
iairs; and, in Cnort, conferred on them
every civility in his power. The four
Captains who were there at that time, de
c'are they never experienced so much
friend Vp from aiy mm, and without the
prefect of interest or hope of reward.
We hope that Congress and the reft of
our countrymen, will take this into con
sideration ; as meeting with so valuable a
friend in such a critical time, rr.uft be a
fv rneient recommendation to Congress to
appoint him consul there, fnouldour com
mjree extend that way. We can allure
them, that it would be much to the inte
rest of those who go there, he being a
man universally refpe&ed, and able to
tranfadl bufiHefs in the best manner, which
is frequently found to be a difficulty in
this county.

OBSERVER No. IX,
Mr. Fenno,
LAST evening, was performed at the
New Theatre, the Comic Opera, Robin
Hood ; Mr. Darley, in the chara&er of
Robin Hood, Mrs. Warrell and Mils
Broadhui ft in the chara&ers of Clorinda
and Angelina, performed their parts so
well, that it would be injuftfee not to name
them, especially in the Son^s. âMrs. War
rell and Mtis Broadhurft pofTefs voices of
the firft impreiiion for excellence; and
altho' different in many rel'pe&s, the audi
ence is ftrcngly impelled, to give the pre
ference to each, while iinging : if either
of them had a decided preference last even
ing, it was Mrs. Warrell in the air to
" the trump of fame, Â£i7<r," in the words
" o conquer with my oh, ho, bo /". She
discovers furprizfrig*power* in an accurate
division and transition of voice and found.
The bounds the Observer has set to tfcefe
occasional fetches, ; would be exceeded,'if
he indulged his feelings, in a detail of the
beauties of this performance : The two
leading motives to attend the Theatre,
are, to hear and fe y the firit was gratified
by a play, and music, both vocal and iii
ftiumental, of the firit rate ; the last was
more emphatically gratified last evening,
than u ual, by Scenery and dresses, both
fuptrb and elegant.âThe Observer solicits
a repetition of this play, cfpecially as Mrs.
Marshall's indisposition during the per
formance, rendered it a little incomplete ;
and altho' fully sensible that the managers
arc the best judges, yet he thinks a repe
tition will excule the more a&ive duties
of the prompter.
The songs which fell to Mr. Mafftrall'i
part, are of the elegant and refined, and
were by him exhibited, in that itile ; but,
(Mr. Marshall will pardon a hint from the
Observer,) he spoke too fa ft, and did not
emphasize fufficiently intwoorthree fceiies,
it will be easy for him to mend in this par
ticular, as in the lcene of difqovery between
him and Angelina, he used cmphafis with
much propriety.
The performers are not aware, how
much they injure their own pretentions to
applause, by speaking too quick ; it is
true, a meaiured, monotonous manner, is
bad ; but flow enough to be diflinctly
heard at a distance, with proper cmphafis
and cadence, is absolutely required by an
audience, who attend the Theatre to be
pleased, and not always with proper al
lowance for venial faultsâA hint to the
managers, is it not among poflibles to keep
better order in your gallery ? The stone
thrown last night from the gallery, is less
than you may hereafter calculate, unless
you take spirited measures.
The Observer has hinted to you before,
it is of importance that you adt upon thjs
occasion, without fear; you will be sup
ported. One word to the players ; com
mit your parts to memory, and have them
perfe&ly at command, and you can ad
well; lpeak well, gesticulate well, in short,
you cannot a & at all without ; this the
Observer mentions not as a new idea :â
but as such an important one ; that vou
will at lcaft commit itperfedly to memory.
A motion was this dav made in the
House of Representatives to take up Mi.
Madison's rcTolutionsâbut on its bcinf
observed that the bill for placing the ports
and harbors in a defenlive state was of
more immediate importance, the motion
was withdrawn.
The above bill was accordingly taken
int.) consideration by the committee of
the wholeâamendedâand finally passed
to be engrailed for a third reading".

A letter frcm (lis Excellency Don John
de Langara, Commandant General of
tile Spanish King's Squadron in the
Mfcditerranean, to his Excellency Bay
lio Don Automa tic Bakles, on the iub
jeÂ£t of burning the Arsenal and the
Tliipa at Totilon.
" I am anxious to give your Excellency
notice of the setting on fire of the arsenal
and the French (hips of Toulon, on the
18th of tki present month (December)
1 793, according to the account given by
the Lieutenant of the (liip DOll Pedro
Cotiella and Don Fianciico Riquelme,
whom I have commiifioned for this' objedt.-
" At 9 o'clock in the morning, Capt.
Sydney Smith, of an English (hip, inform-'
ed me, that Admiral Flood had commis
sioned him for the fitting on fire the arse
nal and the French (hips, and that he came
to join the officers whom I fiiould elect on
my part, to proceed, without delay, to
this operation, and (hat he had two boats,
with guns, tp place in the entry of the
arsenal, and ours were deltined at
Maibofquer. I disposed, that the Adju
tapt Don Francis Riquelme, fhcrld carry
those which he fnould find necessary ; in
the mean time 1 sent the- Lieutenant Don
Cotiella, with Smith and Riquelme, to
put tarred shirts on hoard the (hips of the
line ; the lirll going to the arsenal, and a
little afterwards the second where they
thought bell, to give orders to the com
mandants of the boats of the Spanish forts,
that they should put themselves in fafety
with diligence; they fixed two of the
Englifli and the gun boat commanded by
the Lieutenant of a frigate, Don F>an
ciico Truxillo, in the mouth of the arfe
n.il, to defend the entry from the enemy ;
then polted a strong army by the door of.
the arsenal, reinforced with a violent gun,
to pi event the coming of the common peo
ple, who were already in infurre&ion.
" Theobjeft was, to augment the num
bers of the tarred shirts. and to introduce
to the arsenal our sire-ship St. Louis Gou
laga. To give account of the dispositions
which were made, and of the iire of the
bombs of the enemy, which incommoded
the arsenal, the Adjutant Riquelme re
turned back again to the squadron ; and
in the mean time Coriella and Smith, his
officers, and Truxillo, extended barrels
of pitch and tar thro' the {tores of the ar
senal and the Pillauâfetting two English
boats to defend the galleys, ffiouid they
be attacked.
" At half pad seven in the evening,
Riquelme came back with a great num
ber of combultibles, entered the arsenal
with a fire ship of the English, passing be
fore many {hips which he boarded, and
put 10 (hirts in each, setting them all on
fire.
" At half past nine, the whole arsenal
was in flames."

advantage, to American readers, that this edi
tion poffefles, over every imported edition of
any system of Geog aphy extant. The addi
tion of maps of the several (late , procured at
a very great espenfe, and from the best ma
terials that are attainable, fpraks such full
con vision on this fubje(sV, that t would be
difrefpeft to the reader's underftand'ng to
suppose it reqnifite to enter into a detail of
arguments t<* prove its fuper'n rity. In no
similar work have such maps been ever intro
duced.
The emendations and addition? which are
made in this work,are innumerable, arid occur
in every page. The public are referred to
the preface for a flight (ketch ot a lew ol
them.
The publilher take-; the prefcnt oppoÂ» tu
nity of returning his mod sincere thanks to
those refpe&able characters who have favored
him with documents for improving the maps
of several of the ftat<s. He rcquHts a conti
nuance of their kindness ; and hopes that such
public spirited citizens, as are ptoflefled ot (i
---milar documents, will favor him with their
afflftauce in perfecting his undertakii g.
The extraordinary encouragement with
which he has been favored, has excited
in his bread the warmest sentiments of grati
tudeâ sentiments w u h time will not efface.
He pledges himfclf to the citizens of the
United States, to (pare e th r pains nor ex
penfe to render the present ed on o' Guihrie s

Designed 10 exhibit in a new point of view,
its eftctts on morals, indujiry, and the peace of

to prove the labor of Jreemen to be much more
productive than that ot Jlavcs ; that countries are
rich, powerful and happy, in proportion as the
laboring people enjoy the fruits of their own
labor ; and hence the tvctCT'ty conclusion, that
slavery is impolitic as well as unjujl.
