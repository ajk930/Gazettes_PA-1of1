AMERICA.
NASSAU, (N. P.) April i.
If we art to form any judgment of the
c mduÂ£t that will be adopted bv the Ame
rican Congress, from the language used
very generally in the southern Hates, it
wWd appear that a Tupture between
England and America is alrnoft certain.
Should such an event really take place
âand that it may not, mull be the wilh
of every real friend to either nation
we may '.'xpedt to fee the manners of the
French Republicans ftriftly copied in A
merica ; and revolutionary tribunals, guil
lotines, with all the other paraphernalia
of French liberty, become as common in
the one country, as they are now in the
other.
It is said that an expedition is aftnally
undertaking againtt New-Oileans from
Kentuckey, and that 6000 men are em
ployed on it.
It is also surmised, that some of the
French frigates which lately arrived in
the Chesapeake are to co operate in thii
enterprise, and may daily be expefted'to
make their appearance at the mouth of the
Miffifippi.
April 4.
Notwithstanding the extreme violence
of many people in the Southern states, and
the attachment they avow for the French
Republicâ it is with difficulty that
a cool dispassionate obfervercan bring him
felf to regard war bet ween England and
America, as an event within the fcope.of
probability, 1
Cut bone ? What good can possibly re
sult to America from such a situation ?
Noneâbut on the contrary, every ill tliat
ought to be guarded against by a nation
whose people are chiefly employed iii agri
culture, the filheries, and commerce.
On the part of there is evk'en'.y
a dilpofition to cultivate a good undtrftaud
j ing with America. The revocation oJ the
inuruftions of November 6th, is a frelh
proof of it; and it is more than probable
that this was done in coufeqnence of repre
sentations from the American minilter at
our court.
A true politician fuffers no resentments to
enter into his systemâwith him the invaria
ble object of puri'uit is what can belt advailce
the intereftÃ of his constituents ; and war, as
being uniformly unprofitable, he never has
recourse to, when it can be avoided wkti any
appearance of attention to national dignity.
One of the advantages, which the original
proje&ors of the reparation of the British
colonics from the mo.iier country promised
to themfeives, was the being thereby pre
cluded from all hazard of bjing involved in
the wars of the Emopean powers ; and th(is,
alcof from, and un on erned in the politic*
and intrigues of the old world, enabled to
cultivate tne arts of peace in perfedt fecurily,
and to afford an asylum to the opprefied and
dift effed-of every other nation.
But all this profpecft of human felicitv, so
flattering to the mind of the philan.hrophlit,
must at once be done aw ay,fhould America
be drawn into the pr;f,.nt war between France
and her powerful enemies. And in return
' for this iacrifice, what can France give ?

| We are favored by the copy of a letter
E from a refpeftible young gentk'man, in
St. Vincents, to his father in this town,
dated April 9, wherein he mentions his
s " visit to the Botanical Garden, and in
glowing colours describes the he
felt on beholding the bread-fruit-tree of
Otaheite, paiticularly dcfcribed by the
late Capt. Cook, likewise the apple-tree,
offaid Island, in full bloom. Inafcout 18
months,the bread-fruit-treCwill bear ; and
all the hopes that were entertained by that
once famed circi mnaviator,of the great
use and comforts of life that might be de
rived from its introduction to th,fe climes,
will be realized.â All the return we can
n make to his menjery, is the greatful tri
bute of a tear.

It range to tell, the nutmeg will not thrive.
" The sago-tree is also in high cultiva
tion, and many produ&ions of the East,
are nurtured here in abundauce.
" The attention that has beeri paid to
tranfpla it in thefe> countries, the luxuries

fling nutter of a particular flower, with
which the women of Otaheite decorate

From the Baltimore Daily AdvertifcrÂ»
To the Citizens of the United States
of America.
Fellow Giruztrsj
THE mailer's arid mates of vefTe'.s, be
longing to the port of Baltimore, having
fublcribed a resolution not to proceed to lea,
until they can do so without apprehenftons
of insult aud robbery ; anJ having appoint
ed us a committee to prepare a circular letter
for their juflifkatidn in the eyes of their
fallow citiien , We beg leave 10 call your at
tention to the following remark*, which we
flatter oufelves will not only rescue us from
the imputation of being ralh and intemper
ate, but will secure to us the approbation
and esteem of those who have a feeling for
the honor of their -country and sympathy
sol- the fufferirigs of its citizens.
To feafaring men it must be unneceflary
to describe the difference between our fitua
tioti and that of the other citizens of Ameri
ca, but as we are desirous of approbation and
support from those who have not had equal
opportunities of alcertaining this difference,
we intreat them to consider that we exerjife
Our profeflion upon an ocean not the pro
perty of an individual,or of one nation, but of
all the inhabitants of the globe; that conse
quently, those laws of all governments,
which proteil their citizens from a<Â£ls of vi
olence and injustice, extend not to us. We
cannot be aided or protected in any other
manner than by the laws, which nations have
agreed lhall be considered as rules lor their
condufi, and by the attention of our own
government, to observe that tbfefc rules are
never deviated from to the prejudice of its
citizeD9, with impunity. When governments
tefufe or neglect this protection, fnarjjiers
mull change their profeflion, or in the pur
suit of it, must submit to. : indignities, which
would render ther,'l unworthy the appellation
of men, much less that of AmericansâWe
consider ourftlves as placed, in this situation,
and we Dial] be believed, when we declare
that we have seen the American FLg treated
with every indignity that it was potlible for
the imaginations of men, regardlefa of honor
or hui ianity to devile ; l'ome of us have fern,
and all of us believe that the Flag of our
country, has repeatedly been reversed oh
board of American veflels, by the com
manders not only of British privateers, but
of British (hips of war. We have seen our
comrades of the sea deprived in different
parts of the British dominions, of their all,
and in some inftancts obliged to beg, even
of thole who robbed them, for support. It
is known to our government, that many va
luable citizens have been loft to their coun
try by the captures of the Algerines ; and
it appears to be believed by all, that the fame
nation which insults us in the Weft-Indies,
has been instrumental in Jetting loose those
barbarians.
We (hall not be acctifed of proceeding
without taking time to deliberate when it is
known that our fufferings commenced above
H year past, and that they have increased with
a regularity, and have been submitted to with
tamenefs ; which occasions us to be appre
hensive, that our government considers their
seamen as a class of citizetis unworthy of
their protection. We are not conscious of
having merited such a character, on the con
trary, we will not fuffer it to be said, and we
trust it will not even be believed by those
who know us, that we are exceeded in pa
triotism by any of our countrymen. We
feel all that enthusiastic affection for our
country and reverence for its laws, which
cliaraclerifes the Americanâwe are willing
to make facrifices for the promotion of its
welfare, rnd we are ready with our lives to
aid in repelling those ads of rapine and in
juft.ee, which ltrike deep at its reputation as
a natlr.ll.
Altho* an embargo effectually prevent,
seamen from theexercife of their profeffion.
yet we with the jnoft sincere fatisfaction
Taw the raeafure adopted by our govern-
\\ e know that the injury of being
so long unemgloyed, would to men of our
moderate fortunes be serious indeed, but we
th " ;t âwas our duty to submit to
a partial fefinfife for the attainment of those
advantages, which we should derive, from
having our rights ascertained, and from be
ing permitted to pursue with fafety, the only
business of which we had an v knowledge.
Calculating therefore that America would
hav: latisfa&ion for the insults (he had re
ceived, before she wonld relax in the tnea
â¢T tt T >D ted iwe have learned
with an aftonifument, not to be described
that the embargo is to expire on the 25th
and tfiat i{ is <xpeÂ£ie& of us that we
are to proceed to sea unarrtied, exposed to
the malice of Britifli privateers arid frigates
armed, and commanded by niifcrearits, whose
only rule of ripJt is the extent of their pow
er.
We flatter ourselves that we fliall evr
ready tt> step forth in -defence of the honor
and interefta of our conn try, but we dare
not face dangers where neither the one nor
the Other is concerned, and wliers y:-e risk
not only our personal fafety, but the leaving
destitute of protestors, our wives and fami
liesâlf we are to be plurigcd into a hopeless
captivity at Algiersâor deprived of our
property and liberty, Contrary to the laws of
nations, by the Britift, and do not receive
the aid of our government, we f&rely will
not be cerifured in declaring, that we consi
der ourselves as wholly thrown from its pro
tection j and that therefore we dare not ven
ture to lea in unarmed vcfftls, having no
other protection than papers of the United
States, until fame favorable alteration make
it prudent for us so to do; or uijtil we are
driven by dire necessity to stake even our
liberty in the attempt, however doubtful,
the success of providing for our familiesâ
â¢ Having thus Hated the reafoiw for our zfio
ciation, which we hope will receive the ap
probation of our countrymen, it only re
mains for us to add that its continuance will
depend on circumstances, at preient doubt
ful in their iflueâwe (hall tlot consider our
selves liable to censure if when those cir
cumstances are known, a majority of those
who have aflociated, ftio.uld deem it proper
that this agreement should no longer be in
force.
THE COMMITTEE.
For the Gazette of the Unitep St.itcs.
Mr. Fen-no,
The Bruflels Gazette is very inquisitive
or a proper chara&er to fill the place of
Second Envoy Extra Extraordinary to
Dreat Britain. Where is the puzzle ?
Let the Demo Club fend an Apoltle.â
Viany advantages besides clubbing that
country would t ufue : They- could {how
hat we are in very sober eatneft. For
Vlr. Jay reprcfsnts only the corrupt gang
)f the Funding Knights. Being a la'.r
-fer he is entangled in chicane. It would
lot be hard to find one of the Club who
s free from all ties, and of course would
with both hands at liberty. Thus the
Englishmen would have a plea taken out
ijf their mouths, viz. That Mr. Jay is
not to be minded inasmuch as the Club
have resolved again ft his going, they
would otherwise pretend that no mortal
can tell who has the upper hand here, the
R.eprefentative Government or the Cfub.
Send two men, one from each, you put
an end to that fort of prattle. You may
take them in by fending an Englilhman,
one that knows all their tricksâsuch a
one as they know from former experience
to be notorionfly worthy of trnfl and
confidence. You may have indeed your
pick and choose between two at lead of
undoubted charader. Further, you may
let them draw lots for the placeâfor fend
the one or the other, every body knows
that it is not in the power of Britain to
corrupt the principles of either. Send
the one or the othei, we may fay, Courts
we defy you to throw a spot on their pi iâ.

them.
The public fcrvice will not fuffer by
the absence of one of them, as the other

1 ExtraS of a Letter from a gentleman in
\ Cork to his correfpmdent in this town.
Cork, February 6, 1794.
I came here two d.iyÂ« ago on account
of an American brig, the Hannah, of Ken
nebeck, William Springer, master, from
Bourdeaux to Philadelphia, with 280
pipes of brandy, beingfeized here by the
lieutenant-governor, under prtence ofinfor
mation being given him, that the cargo
was (hipped by, and is the property of the
National Convention. I have wri'.en to
Thomas Pinckney, Esq. Envoy at Lon
don, on this matter, in order that he may
apply to the mini (try; and 1 requeftthat
thou wilt be so kind as to communicate it
to the Piefident or his Secretary, as I have
reafoo to think the brandy is for Congress.
It is consigned to Thomas Lee of Phila
delphia, and marked T. L. and there fail
ed with the Hannah, two large fhipa and
a brig for Philadelpl lid.
The Hannah having sprung a leak, putintpthwbsAortwoWeek!i ago,aadan %-
liftman, named Thomas Cux, who escaped
on board the Hannah from Bourdeaux,
by parting as the Captain's Steward,on his
arrival here, gave the Governor informa
tion as above. has since gone to Dub
lin and pretends that the Convention de
prived him of confiderabie property in
Bourdeaux, and that he expects to recover
it out of this brandy.
PHILADELPHIA,
MAY 2J.
Ycfterday afternoon about 6 o'clock, soon
after the commencement of a (hower from
'a cloud in the Koitl.weft, the wind then
louthweft, suddenly Ihif'ted to the northeast
when a heavy ihower of hal 1 united with the
rain, descended with great clattering and
violence. The (tones were generally round
and of extraordinary size, measuring 3- 4 ths
of an inch in Diameter, and from 1-4 to 1-3
an inch thick ; the ihape various, many co
nical. Much injut-y must have been sustain
ed in the country ; in the city a great many
panes of glals were broke. This morning
the hail was remaining in large quantities,
in places from which the fun is excluded.
Mr Blount's motion for inteidifling all
commercial intercourse with the Well-In
dia I Hands, laid on the table of the House
of Representatives, some days since, was
this day called up by that gentleman.â
Mr. Sedgwick moved the previous quefti-.
onâviz. (hall the vote be now taken ?â
which paiTed in the negativeâ-4.6 to 24..
It is reported that the Britilh Minister
here has received notice from our govern
ment that General Wayne should have or
ders to oppose any armed force, of what
ever nation, which he might fall in with
Jn his expedition. Tiiefe orders, it is
/aid, are to be given, in confidence of the
truth of the account that Governor Sim
coe has marched three companies into our
territory, 'fhis warning is a piece of
courtesy which might well be omitted, at
lealt towards a nation whose orders to
plunder tu were ftudioudy kept a secret.
Gen. Adv.
The Britiih policy we reprobate,
_ For arts ihfidious juflly blast theii fame;
t Vet an tiu-decal (dribblers, bawl and prate,
Because we do not praStfe, what we

T.vo logues they lay, will make one honest
man,
Hence all their schemes of rogu'ry and
deceit,
But should we practice on their fay'rite
plan,
Perdition soon would overwhelm the
State.
Compound, and decompound rogues as
you will,
Then in a morter with a p.cftle bray
them,
Kogues they go in, and rogues continue
(till,
Their dialcft will constantly betray
them.

Volunteer by Mr. Cutting,
The Great Family of Mankind.
Volunteer by Capt. Downs,

To crown the feaft of reason with more
than the barren sentiments of philanthropy,

tioo, opened some time before among the
humane and charitable of all defcripiions,
was compleated to the amount of 1000 dol
lars, for the use and comfort of the citizens
of the United States, in captivity at Algiers.
The money has a&ually been forwarded to
its defoliation. And the Americans in Lijbon,
said unto their fellow citizens of the United

Of Charlotte, the Reviewers have given
the following character.
IT mav be a Tale of Truth, for it .s n#t
unnatural, and it is a talr ot real diitrels.â
Charlotte, by the artifice of a teachei, recom
mended to a febool, irem humanity rather
than a ponviftion ot her integ' itv, or the re.
gular'ity of her former comJutt, is enticed
from her govevrcf , v d accompanies a young

They are printedoll a paper nearly similar
to that of the couuterfeit Five Dollar Notes

The fine rifliji 1>Â«4Â» through the word I veri

They may be diftiftguiflied from the genu- r
ine by the following MAIIKS : 1
The paper of the counterfeits is of a more |
tender texture and glofley furface than the '
genu'ne, and the;e is no water mfcrkinthem. '
The letter C. in the word Cashier, in ihe
true bills isftrongiy marked, whereas in the
counterfeits, the whole letter is a fine hair
stroke, evidently in an unfinifhed state. The
letters in the word demand, is badly lormcd
and the whole word ill done, and there is no
comma at the end of it, as there is in the
genuine hills.
The marginal device, is much daiker in
I the falfe, than in the genuine bills owing to
the lhade ttfokes being coai fe>, much rearei
together, and consequently much more nu
merous. This difference ftnkes the eye at firit
view.
The fame reward of ONE THOUSAND
DOLLARS, wij| be paid for appi ehending, &r
