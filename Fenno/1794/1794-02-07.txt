AND
The following Interejling ADDRESS,
From A Citizen of America, to the Citi-
Zens of Europe, tvas publijbed in Paris, at
the English Press, in oÃuber lajl, and supposed
to have been re-printed in London, Jbortly after.
T TNDERSTANDING that a proposal is in
w tended to be made at the ensuing meeting
of the Congreis of the United States of Ameri
ca, " to fend Commiflioners to Europe to con
fer with the Ministers of all the Neutral Pow
ers, for the purpose of negociating prelimina
ries of Peace," I address this letter to you on
that fubjeÂ«st, and on the several matters con
nected therewith.
In order to discuss this fubje<Sb through all its
circumstances, it will be necessary to take a re
view of the state of Europe, prior to the French
revolution. It will from thence appear, that
the powers leagued against France are fighting
to attain an obje<st, which, were it poflible to be
attained, would be injurious to themselves.
This is not an uncommon error in the history
of wars and governments, of which the conduct
of the Englilh government in the war against
America is a ilriking instance. She commenc
ed that war for the avowed purpose of subju
gating America; and after wafting upwards of
one hundred millions sterling, and then aban
doning the objed, she discovered, in the course
of three or four years, that the prosperity of
England was increased, instead of being dimi
nifhecl, by the independence of America. In
short, every clrcumftance is pregnant with some
natural efFe&, upon which intentions and opini
ons have no influence ; and the political error
lies in misjudging what the efted will be. En
gland misjudged it in the American war, ai d
the reasons I shall now offer wiil shew, that she
misjudges it in the present war.âln difculflng
this fubje&, I leave out of the question every
thing refpe&ing forms and systems of govern
ment; for, as all the governments of Europe
differ from each other, there is no reason that
the government of France should not differ
from the reft.
OF THE STATE OF EUROPE PRIOR TO
THE FRENCH REVOLUTION.
The clamours continually railed in all the
countries of Europe were, that the family of
the Bourbons was become too powerful; that
the intrigues of (he court of France endanger
ed the peace of Europe. Austria saw with a
jealous eye the connexion of France with Prus
sia; and Prussia, in her turn, became jealous
of the connexion of France with Austria; En
gland had Wafted millions unfuccefcfully 'in at
tempting to prevent the family compact with
Spain; RufTia disliked the alliance between
France and Turkey : And Turkev"became ap
prelienfive of the inclination of France to
wards an alliance with Russia. Sometimes the
quadruple alliance alarmed some of the pow
ers, and at other times a contrary system a
larmed others, and in all those cases the charee
was always made against the intrigues of the
Bourbons.
Admitting those matters to be true, the on
ly thing that could have quieted the apprehen
fioiM of those powers with refpedt to the inrcr-
{ C T^?T C i,f r â¢ ce '. would have been her entire
n-u? RA^'^ Y in Europe ; but this was im
pofiible to be obtained, or if obtained was im
pofiible to be secured, because the genius of
her government was repugnant to all such re
ftriiftions.
It now happens that by entirely changing
the genius of her government, which France
has done for herfelf, this neutrality, which
neither wars could accomplish nor trea
ties secure, arises naturally q{ itfelf, and be
comes the ground upon which the war should
terminate. It is the thing that approaches the
nearell of all others to what ought to be the
political views of all the European power?; and
there is nothing that can so effe&ually fe'ctu e
this neutrality, as that the eenius of the French
government should be different from the reft
of Europe.
But if their objeA is to reflore the Bourbons
and monarchy together, they will unavoidably
restore with it all the evils of which they have
complained; and the firft question of discord
will be, whose ally is that monarchy to be ?
Will England agree to the restoration of the
family compart, against which Ihe has been
fighting and scheming ever since it elided ?
Will Prussia agree to restore the alliance be
tween France and Austria, or will Austria a
gree to restore the former connexion between
France and Pruftia, formed on purpose to op
pose herfelf; or will Spain or Ruflia, or any of
the maritime powers, agree that France and
her ihould be allied to England? In fine, will
any of the powers agree to strengthen the 1
hands of the other against itfelf? Yet all these
cases involve thcmlelves in the original question
of the restoration of the Bourbons; and on
the other hand, all of them difappeai- bv the
neutrality of France.
If their object is not to restore the Bourbons
it mull be the impracticable projeit of a parti
tion of the country. The Bourbon, will th -n
be out of the question, or, more propcrlv
peaking, they v. ill be put in a worse condition
lor as the preservation of the Bourbons nii.de a
part of the firft objed, thee::tirj,â:ion of them '

[Whole No. 507.j
makes a part of the second. Their pretended
friends will then become interested in their de
fl;ru<stion, because it is favourable to the pur
pose of partition, that none of the ncaiina]
laimants fnould be left in existence.
But however the projeÂ£ of a partition may
at firft blind the eyes of the confederacy, or
however each of them may hope to outwit the
other in the progress or in the end, the em
barraflfments that will arise are insurmounta
ble. But were even the objc& attainable, it
would not be of that general advantage to the
parties, as the neutrality of France, which
costs them nothing; and to obtain which they
would formerly have gone to war.
I OF THE PRESENT STATE OF EUROPE,
AND THE CONFEDERACY.
In the firft place, the confederacy is not of
that kind that forms itfelf originally by concert
and consent. It has been forced together by
chance. An heterogeneous mass, held only by
the accident of the moment, and the instant
that accident ceases to operate, the parties
will retire to their f6rmer rivalfhips.
I will now, independently of the impracti
cability of a partition proje&, trace cut some of
the embarraflments that will arise among the
confederated parties: for it is contrary to the
interest of a majority of them that such a pro
jecft should succeed.
To understand this part of the fubjetft, it iÂ»
neceflary, in the firft place, to cast ail eye over
the map of Europe, and observe the geographi
cal situation of the several parts of the confe
deracy ; for however strongly the passionate
politics of the moment may operate, the poli
tics that arise from geographical situation are
the raoft certain, and will in all cases finally
prevail,
The world has been long amused with whpt
is called the " balance of poiverÃut it is not
upon armies only that this balance depends.
Armies have but a small circle of aetion.
Their progress is flow and limited. But whc-n
we take maritime power into the calcu
lation, the scale extends universally. It com
prehends all the interests conne&ed with com
merce.
The two great maritime powers are England
and France. Destroy either of thole, and the
balance of naval power is destroyed. The
whole world of commerce that passes on the
ocean would then lie at the mercy of the other.
And the ports of any nation in Europe
be blocked up.
The geographical situation of those two ma
ritime powers comes next under cojjfideration.
Each of them occupies one entire fide of the
channel, from theftraitsof Dovet and Calais to
the opening into the Atlantic. The commercc
of all the northern nations, from Holland to
Russia, must pass the straits of Dover and Ca
lais, and along the Channel, to arrive at the
Atlantic.
This being the cafe, the fyftematicical politics
of all the nations, northward of the straits of
j Dover and Caiais, can be ascertained from their
geographical situation ; for it is neceflary to the
fafety of their commerce that the two fides of
the channel, either in whole or in part, fliould
not be in pofleflion either of England or of
France. While one nation poflefics the who's
of one fide, and the other nation the other fide,
the northern nations cannot help feeing that in
any situation of things their commerce wili ai
ways find protection on one fide or the other.
It may sometimes be that of England, and fonic
times that of France.
Again, while the Englilh navy continues in
its present condition, it is necelftry that ano
ther navy Ihould exist to controul the universal
lway the former would other wile, have ov,t
the commerce of all nations. France is the on
ly nation in Europe where this balance car. be
placed. The navies of the North, '.vere thsy
fufficiently powerful, could not he ftifficiently
operative. They are blocked up by the ice fix
months in the year. Spain lies too remote ;
besides which, it is only for the fake of her
American mines that {he keeps up a navy.
Applying these cases to tht' projt Â»S of a par
tition of France, it will appear, that the project
involves with it a destruction or ihe ba-
LANCE OF MARITIME POWER; DCCaufe it is
only by keeping France entire and indi-.-iiibie
that the balance can be kept up. Tin's is a
cafe that at firft fight lies remote and r.lmoft
hidden. But it interefis all the niaritirr.c ..r.d
commercial nations of Europe i;i as gTcar a de
gree as any cafe that has ever come b 're
themâln lhort, it is with war an i
law. In law, the firft rocritt < f th. _ >JC u<:
come 101 lin the multiplicity of urÂ£un: t nts*
and in war they become loft in the variet / oÂ£
events. New objcdls arise that take the lead
of all that went before, and every thing
fumes a new afped. This was the cafe in the
last great confederacy, in what is called the fur
ceflion war, and most probably will be the cafe
in the present.
I have now thrown together such thourhts as
occurred to me on the fewraj febjeci; c. imeiSed

have fouwl a contolation in this truth.
That the fame cause which at present

any dangerous competition with o'ir (hip

rights, is the great obstacle to a great na-
tional c:-:
Mr. G. remarked, that political confi
scations in his opinion, combined in re
commending the pmpofitions at the pre
sent moment. The European war, the
delicate crisis of the war, afforded ill his
mind, fbong inducements to the measure.
These conliderations had been urged with
a view to anoppoiite effect ; but he would
aik, v.hat time would be chosen by a
wife nation comparatively weak, to ad
drets herfelf to an unjust nation, compa
ratively strong, for a restoration of viola
ted rights ? Would it not be, when the
strong nation fnould be so engaged, as to
be inc?.pab!e of exerting her whole undi
vided force in the refiitance ? This is the
cafe with Great Britain at present : For
whatever may be the ultimate event of the
present European contest, the subjuga
tion of Trance, will require at leajl, ano
ther campaign. Here he thought the
tart adage, quoted by some gentleman,
fitted the fubjeft much better than that
part of it to which it had been applied.
No friendlhip in trade. The United
Strin-s only demanded a restoration of vi
olated rights. Great Britain has com
mitted the violation. It was unnecessary
to recapitulate the aggreflions of Great
Biitaiu, upon the national rights of the
United States. He could not help re
peating one circumstance: her subjecting
American veflels to seizure and search.and
exempting those of Sweden and Den
mark. This evidenced a peculiar enmity
levelled at the United States. He men
tioned this circumstance, for another rea
son. It (hould be recollected, that some
unauthorized attempts were made upon
the veflels of Sweden and Denmark, and
that firm and manly answers produced
concefiions. As the only neutral nations
except the United States, they have set
an example, which ought be imitated ; for
notwithstanding the trivial weight of the
United States, in the scale of European
affairs as has been suggested, he believed
that Great Britain would prefer a war
with both those nations, to a war with the
United States.
The recent example of Sweden and
Denmark, proves that the British cabinet
are as fenfihle of the advantages of con
celfion, in some cases, as they were insen
sible in other cases, of the diflionor of com
mitting depredations on the rights of o
thcr nations.
Mr. G. thought another consideration
of the moment, extremely important.â
The injuries and insults of Great Britain,
repeated and continued, have excited such
an impulse in the public mind, that the
whole people would feelingly second any
decisive measures, which the government
might adopt, for rellonng the"honor of
the nation; and if a national trial (hould
be the result of the propositions, it would
from that cause, be commenced under the
moS pleafmg, and promising auspices.â
Several gentlemen opposed to the resolu
tions, have declared their resentment a
gaintt Biitain, and profefled themselves
for energetic measures, to restore the ho
nor of the natio". He wilhed the gen
tlemen would fpecify their proportions,
and biing them before the committee:
he thought it would be a much better evi
dence of their dispositions, than objecting
to the present propositions without offer
ing a fubftitutc. He declared that he
ion for the rettora
was not so much wedded to the present
proportions, as not to be willing to con
i'der any others, which might he better
caloulated to produce the intended effect.
A gentlemen from Virginia (Mr. Lee)
who informed the committee, that he
was not fer.t here to indulge his resent
ment!:, profeffed at the fame time the
most violent resentment againll the cabi
net of Great Britain; while he pronoun
ced an eulogy upon the Britiih people.â
1 f the people would adopt the gentleman's
idea, and separate themselves fom the ca
binet, he might be juftified in his distinc
tion. The proportion 'in that cafe,
would be levelled against the cabinet, and
not against the people : In that event,
both his resentment and attachments
might be indulged. But if the gentle
man would recollect, that the difpofitioa
of the people, towards the United States,
is communicated only thro' the cabinet;
that they fopport tfie cabinetâthat the
cabinet is the organ of their will, he will
find that his diltin&ion is wholly without
foundation.
respected,
We have been admoniftred, of the pro
priety of baniihmg feeling, and resorting
to judgment. A nation being corapofed
of the aggregate of individuals, he be
lieved poiTdftd the fame feelings, and he
doubted the truth of the philosophy,
which advised us to banifli an effentisd in
gredient of human nature. Feeling and
judgment, ought to perform their respec

is an admirable bead of burthen ; but not
of enterprrfe ; it bears misfortunes well;
but was never calculated to refill oppres
sions. The United States have been in
jured and insulted. Instead therefore of
patience and forbearanceâwifdom, cau
tion herfelf, would prescribe boldness, en
terprise, energy, firmnefs. America, has
therefore purfiied this conduÂ£t, and expe
rience has proved, that it is not unwise.
He helieved that Great Britain, calcula
ted upon her own influence, and a want
of concert in our counsels ; now was the
time to convince the world, that injury
from abroad produced concert at home.â
This conduct had therefore characterized
America : he hoped ft would always con

Legislature of Pennsylvania,
Mr. Evans called the attention of the
Hotife to the fubjeft of the impeachment
against the Comptroller-General, now pen
ding before the Senate. He observed,
that Mr. Nicholfon had given an answer
to the Senate, pleading not guilty to the
charges comprehended in the articles of
impeachment j it consequently now rests
with the House of Representatives to re
ply to the said answer of Mr. Nicholfon.
Mr. Evans therefore moved that the fol

" Resolved, That the House of Re

is this difference however between them,
that bodies politic have less confc'totifnefs of
Â£uilt ior violating the moral Jaw than na
tural persons. The rcafon is obvious ; a
Hate is composed of numbers, and where
ver an injury is done by a multitude, the
responsibility is divided. Every man really
deserves aihare of blame ; yet every man
can fhift off a great portion of it upon
others. Hence a puliic body never feels
guilty though every individual will sepa
rately disapprove of the measure which
does the injury. This circumstance strong
ly enforces the ncceflity of some provilion
for compelling jufhee from such public bo
dies. An individual has confcience 9 honor,
reputation to spur him to fulfil his duties ;
a Hate has very little of either ; and in
proportion as the influence of these prin
ciples is less in a body poliiic, than in natu
ral it becomes necefiarv to substi
tute a compulsory process. The law is
lade tor the good; were every man
at all times influenced by pure motives,
law would ceafc to be necefiary. Just so
of public bodies. Were motives of JlriQ
justice always to influence public public
bodies, more efficient provision would ne
ver be necefiary to procure from them
perse& right. But admit the poflibility
that, in a legiflaturc, just claims may be
frittered away, or rejeftcd, and the neces
sity and propriety of compulsory provisi
on for obtaining justice, must also be ad-
mirt-.c 1 ,
Besides, these fame moral persons, or
states, all cla:m and cxercife the right of
compelling individuals to render jullice.
Why (hould not the right be mutual? Is
that man legally free, who can be forced
to pay the last penny he owes to a state ;
while the state may owe him a fortune,
and ltc cannot compel the payment of a
fl;i!!ing r Is it not recognized unequivo
cally as a general principle of common
law, that right and remedy zre reciprocalâ
and that wherever there exists a right, the
law famifhes a remedy ;* But is not the
d(iÂ£trine//'a/ suits cannot be fujlained againjl
Jlates, a direst and flagrant violation of this
excellent maxim of common law and com
mutative justice ! And is not a discretion
ary power to do justice or not at pleasure,
more particularly dangerous in large popu
lar bodies, where responsibility is divided
and reduced to nothing ! Let calm reason,
conscience and the religion of christians
determine these important questions.

Extract of a letter from a gentleman in

" Some time has elapsed since 1 had
the pleasure of hearing from you ; I am

worthy Clergy of your City to the Legis
lature of your State, on the fubjeft of re
vising the la-.vs for the fupreffion of vice
and immorality, and for enforcing a due
obfervancc of the Lord's Day. It was
certainly exhibiting a very feaionfable tes
timony against the prevailing irreligious
spirit of the timesâ" a Land of Levity"
fays an excellent writer, "is a Land of
Gu'.lt." What, alaj then, is a Land a
bounding in Profanenefs and Impietyâ
and at the very instant when the Supreme
Ruler of the World is withdrawing his
chastening rod, contending for Theatrical
and other amusements, which are evident
ly calculated to please a corrupt and vi
tiated mind, and are emphatically charac
teristic of those who are " Lovers of
Pleasure, more than Lovers of God."â
I mod heartily wish success to the lauda
ble efforts of those who nobly appear to
fvem the torrent of fafhionable vices, more
dangerous to morals, because less fufpeft
ed than flagrant crimes, tho' history and
observation concur to evince that the lat
ter are frequently the offspring of the
former,
" Before you receive this, I expect
that an important and united exertion
will be made by petitioning Congress to
effect afi Abolition of that dTgrace to our
country âthe African Slave Trade. If
it were not for those Jlrangc extremes
which often meet in the fame character, I
flionld suppose that the reccwt informa

Algiers, would, entirely fupercede the ne
cessity of any reasoning to demonstrate
the worse than abominable iniquity of
enslaving our fcHbw-ir.cn. I hope that
the Legi(l aturc of the Union will not be
b&ckwaid in explicitly enabling such laws

Commerce and of Public Safety, by Peter
Marec, deputy from Finit'ere, printed by
order of the National Convention.
Citizen Legislators,
YOU have referred to your diplomatic com
mirtee6 of marine and commerce united, the
proportion made in your body, the 20th of .Â» ay
last, to prelent tÂ«> you without delay a project
of an aÂ£k of navigation.
This object so worthy ot' the meditation of a
republican legislator, has not been over ooked
by your committee of public fjfety In the re
port they made to you on the 29th of May, #n
the ftateofthe French Republic, they traccd to
you in general the invaluable advantages which
would result to her from a measure, which hav
ing been adopted by England a century and a
half ago, hat. been tr.e moll fruitful source
the profperh'y of that rival power. But in a
queflion of thi-. nature, antral coufiderations
and observations hallily made, are inlufficient
to impress conviction on every mind.
Your marine committe has been employed
in collediiig such ideas and elements as might
completely enlighten you on the importance of
a navigation n<St, and finally determine you to
establish at the fide of the political conflitution
ot the empire, tins firft basis of her commercial
conflitution. They could not unite, according
to your views, with the diplomatic committee,
which has not beer, renewed fmce the fupprefli
on of the committee of general defence; but
they have concerted with those of commerce
and public f.ifety, anil it is in the name of these
three commitrees that I cÂ«me to present to you
the result of their deliberations.
1 he principal end of the navigation a6fc which
we propose, is to destroy the inrerpolition of all
indirect navigation, in the maritime transporta
tion of ohi" articles of exchange with foreign
nations, and in fine to put a flop to that inter*
mediate carrying trade, so prejudicial to our
commerce and marine, wiiich hitherto has ren
dered us benevolent tributaries of all the mari
time powers of Europe. This adl hat also for
its objedl, to reserve to the national veflcls t!*e
exclusive privilege of trai sporting the fame ar
ticles Â«t exchange from one port of the Repub
lie to another.
1 his double prohibition is doubtless contrary
to the principles of an indefinite commercial
freedom : but such freedom perhaps would not
agree with the fyflem of an universal republic;
and it is conceived that the republic of the hu
man race will be still more difficult so realise
than that of Plato. It is then our wisdom not
to a low ourselves 10 be dazzled by the brilliant
imaginations ot political writers, and whÂ« warp
the light of reason and experience in their
specious arguments and pompous theory. It
is from the example of the great nations who
furronnd us, from that nation especially, who
iirft knew how to apply to her navigation pro
hibitory regulations; it is from that sourCe we
ought to rules for our condu&, if we
have at heart the true prosperity of our country.
Fiauce taken in a commercial point of view
is the richefl cntefpoc of the universe; she is
alio the market which offers the moll contain
ers and v?;nt for the industry o r other nations.
Whence does it happen that, with so many re
foinces and wants, with such abundance 01 ter
ritorial commodities productions and merchan
diles withthehabit ofconfaming such great quan
titiesof the commodities produ&ions&merchan
diles of foreigners, her navigation has hitherto
been so languishing, her commercial marine so
pitiful, so altogether destitute of the advanta
ges which are its inherent right ? Whence does
it happen that the flag of her mod formidable
enemies has almost excluiively figured in her
commercial relations ? Becaufc she was deflitute
of a navigation aCt; becaufc a falfe, timid, and
frivolous policy knew not how to produce, or
did not dare to borrow, from a great nation
prou d of its wealth and of its credit, this valu
able iytlem, which has contributed more to the
power of that nation, than all the victories of
iu admirals.
in a word it is time that the French nation
should know all her advantages, and how to
profit of them. It is time for her to repair all
the injury she has futtained, in this refped,
through the ignorance or criminal indifference
of an opprelLve government, more careful Â»f
prefervmg at any price, itj defpwric authority,
more occupied in diplomatic intrigues or fifcal
operations, more tenacious in maintaining the,
falfe fplcndor of a throne at the expense of the
true iiitercfts of the people, than attentive to
render produtf ive by every means in its power,
their agriculture, their commerce, and their
industry.
Doubtless there never was a more favourable
occalion for procuring to our country the bene
fit of a navigation a <51. Numerous republican
armies, familiarized with vidory, being now
fighting for her independence and her liberty,
against the very powers who are the mofl in
terefled in preventing us from enjoying such an
atft. Before the war, it might have been fuffi
cient for us to have made such an a<st merely
with regard to England; such was the effeÂ«sl on
Holland, when Oliver Cromwe l, in 1651, had
a decree palled by the British parliament.
At that epoch, according to the inquiries of
one of our countrymen, the befl informed at the
present day, in the knowledge of our true com
mercial & political intercOs (Citizen Ducher*)
the maritime commerce of the Enjrlifh did not
cowfifl of more tLan 96,000 tons of transports,
in 179Â°Â» 't rose to more than 800,000 tons.
Again at that epoch, according to the inter
esting report prelented to the conflituent afleni-
* If the convention pass the present proje<ft
of a navigation a<5V into a decree, the country
will be under obligations to Citizen Ducher,
who for upwards of two ) ears part, has endea~
â¼cured to obtain the adoption of this plan with
indefatigable perseverance, as well in commit
tees of the National Aflembly, as by the pub
lication of his writings. This is an a& of justice
which it affords mc p!eafure publicly to render
to that excellent citizen.
bly, on this fubje*Sl, by Citizen Delatfre. "One
half of the navigation of England was carried
on by foreigners. England has imperceptibly
re-taken her rights; towards the year of 1700,
foreigners poflefled no more than the fifth part
of this navigation ; in 1715, only a little more
than the ninth ; in 1750, a little more than a
twelfth; and in 1791, they poflefled only the
fourteenth part of it.'*
Our navigation a year ago, was in regard to
foreign nations, still more unfavourable than
the English navigation of 1651. Permit me
here, to give in a concise manner the ftrikiug
calculations which were laid before you on this
fubje&, in the month of December lafl, by the
ex-mini fie r of the home department, in the ta
ble containing the amount of the exterior com
merce of the Republic of France.

The tenth volume of the Encyclopedia i*
now prelented to the public ; but as it makes
its appearance in an impcrfelt state, I'ome ac
count of the reason of that imperfe&ion (houhf
be â  iven. On the Brh <-f September last, the
Publilher had the misfoitune of having hit
Printing Office burnt down by a fire which
broke out in the neighbourhood, and a great
quantity of his printing materials deitroyed,
and among other articles, the figures, with
which he whs printing the tables or lo
garithms, belonging to the present volume,
were melted down by the violence of the fire.
As a Pupply of the ft could not lie immediately
obtained, he was under the neceflity of pub
lifhing the volume without the'e tables; but
hopes he (hall be able to pnbli/h them with the
next volume which is now in considerable for*
wardnefs.
The Publiflier embraces this opoartunity of
expreflmg his grareful acknowledgments ro
the generous public, for the very liberal pa
tronage with which his undertaking has been
honored j at the fume time he takes the li
berty of representing to such of the fubferibers
as are in arrears, the indil'penfible neceffitv of
punctuality, both in raking; up rhe volumes as
early as polfib'e after publication, and of pay
ing for them when taken. Many of the fub
feribers having got only one, two, three, &rc.
volumes, and several volumes remain unpaid;
Thus the work hangs in all its different stages
from the commencement; and though the im
portance of a few dollars may be but a trifle
to the individuals,' yet the accumulation of
these trifles unpaid lays the Publisher under
very fetious embarrafTment, and deprives him
of the use of many Thoufends of Dollars which
at this time would be of very eflential service.
For these reasons rhe Publi llier finds himfelf
under the neccflÂ»ty of recurring to the original
terms of publication, and in future no vo
lumes will he delivered but only to those who
tako and oay to the time of publication.
