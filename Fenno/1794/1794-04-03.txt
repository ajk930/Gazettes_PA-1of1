A meflage from the President of the U-
nited States.
United States, 28th March, 1794
Gentlemen of the Senate, and of the
House of Representatives.
In the execution of the Reiblution of
Congress, bearing date the 26th of March
1794, and imposing an embargo I have
requested the governors of several states
to call forth the force of their militia, if
it should be ncceflary for the detention of
veflels. This power is conceived to be in.
cidental to an embargo.
It also deserves the attention of Con
gress how far the clearances from one dif
trift to another, under the law as it now
(lands, may give rife to evafidn of the em
bargo. As one security, the eollcch>râ
have been inftrufted to refufe to reeeiv
the surrender of coasting licences for th
purpose of taking out registers, and to
require bonds from rcgiftered veflels>
bound from one diftrift to another, for
the delivery of the cargo within the Unit
ed States. ;
It is not understood, that the resoluti
on applies to coafling vessels, although
their occupations lie generally in parts
beyond the United States. But without
further reltrictions, there is an opportuni
ty of their privileges being uled as means
of eluding the embargo.
All armed veifels poffefling public com
millions from any foreign power (letters of
marque excepted) are considered as not li
able to the embargo.
fhefe circumstances are transmitted to
Congress for their consideration.
Go: WASHINGTON.
The said menage and papers were read,
&c'ommitted to Mr. Dexter, Mr. Murray,
and Mr. Goodhue.
Mr. Dexter from the committee to
whom was referred the above message of
the Prelident of the United States, the
next day reported the following resolution,
which was agreed to by the House.
Resolved by the senate and house of
representatives of the United States of
America in congress assembled, that dur
ing the continuance of the present embar
go, no registered veflel, having on board
goods, wares and merchandize, shall be
allowed to depai t from one part of the U
nitcd States, to any other port within the
fame, unless the mafic;-, owner, consignee
or factor, shall fiilt give bond, with one
or more sureties, to the collector of the
diftrift from which she is about to depart,
in a sum of double the value of the veflel
and cargo, that the said goods, wares or
merchandize, shall be relanded in some
port of the United. Stales, which bond,
and also a certificate from tlie collector of
thediftrift where the fame may be relanded,
shall, by the colleitoi s refpedtively, be
transmitted to tfcr secretary of the treafu||
ry.âThat the several collectors be prohi
bited from granting a clearance to any fo
reign fliip or vessel, in any cafe whatever,
during the continuance of the present em
bargo ; and all armfd veflels, poffefiinf
public commifTions from any foreign pow
er (lettersof marque excepted,) are to be
considered as not liable to the embargo.
A message from the senate by Mr. Otis
their fesretary, informed the house, that
the senate have agreed to a resolution,
to carry into morej;omplete effect, the re
solution directing an embargo,~to VvTiTcK
they desire the concurrence of this honfe.
The said resolution was conlidered and
disagreed to.
Another message from the senate,. by

that the senate have agreed to the resoluti

The Phoenix, Captain Moore, just return
ed from the N. W. Coast of America, brings
the firftfubftantiated accounts which we have
heard of the loss of the Lark, Capt. Peters,
which veffej was fitted out from this port
some years ago, at the commencement of
those enterprizing expeditions to Nootka
Sound, which have since experienced such
various fhccefs, and caused so serious an-al
tercation between England& Spain. The Lark
was loft on Beerings Illand, off Kamfchatka
and several of the crew got on (hore: but
owing to the hard (hips they underwent from
the inclemency of the climate, and want of
necellaries, only four survived, who were re
lieved by a Ruffian vessel which carried them
to Siberia, where they have met with the
moll humane and attentive treatment from
the Ruffians. They are two Portuguese and
two Lascars, and are still residing at Irkufk,
in Siberia.
The Phoenix found in Beals harbor a Por
tuguefs Snow, commanded by Capt. Viana,
oi Macoa, which had wintered on the N. .
Coalt. The former Captain had been killed
by the natives at Port Mulgrave, who had
attempted to board the vessel.
An American Ihip had left a man to learn
the language and trade with the natives.
Captain Moore humanely supplied him with
such ne:effaries as he could spare.
In a Bay near the Green Islands, a Ruffian
Captain Beramhoff, who commanded a fqita
dron of boats, came on board the Phoenix,
and informed Captain Moore, that he came
from Kodiac, and was cruizing along the
Coast in quest of the natives, for the purpose
of civilizing them, according to orders from
the Emprel's. He had also received orders
to treat the Englilh with the utmost civility :
in consequence of which, he oifered Captain
Moore every afliftance in his power to afford.
The Ruffians were erecting some works in
Cook's River. The commander mentioned
that there had been no trade between Russia
and China for fix years, and that they got
all their tea from England: that article fold
in Siberia so high as nine roubles per pound.

NEW-YORK, April 1.
Capt. Cummins, arrived here yesterday,
failed from St. George's, Grenada, the
9th March : He informs us, that accounts
had been receeivea there on the 7th, by
the Lady Hammond, from Martinique
that the Britilh Batteries were to open cn
Fort Bourbon on the morning of the Bth:
That a series of heavy rains had retarded
their operations, and that about fifty of
the Britilh troops had beer, killed in the
lines by Ihells from the Fortâbut that it
was completely in veiled.
Capt. Cummins also informs us, that
the port of Grenada is open until the id of
May, for every article that can be admitted
in Britilh bottoms from the United States
with permiflion to enter for exportation,
any thing they may have inadmissible, and
carry it away with them.
Capt. Cummins, has favored us with
Grenada newspapers, to the 7th of March,
from which we have copied the following
undÂ«r the Grenada head :
St.GEORGE'S (Gre.) March 7.
The Ihip Mary, Capt. Molyneux, arri
ved here from Martinique on Monday
morning. When the Mary failed, which
was on Saturday, every thing was quiet
at St. Pierre, and the mod perfeit order
and regularity eftablilhed among the inha
bitants, who under the protection of the
Britilh arms, and the equitable command
of Col. Myers, enjoyed a state of security,
to which they had long been strangers. â
The arms of the inhabitants were demand
ed, and delivered up to the Englilh, who
deposited them 'in a magazine appropria
ted for that purpose. The batteries, which
had been carried 011 with great expedition
considering the immense labour they re
quired, were completed and mounted with
upwards ot an hurtoied heavy cannon ana
mortars, to act against Fort Bourbon ;
but their fire had not commenced, not
a lingle (hot or (hell having been thrown
into the Fort. Sunday night, was the
time appointed for the cannonade to be
gin, and it was the general opinion, that
the place could not hold out more than 48
hours. In the whole of the arduous and
fatiguing fetvice of erccting the batteries
and carrying the guns from the store-ships,
for a considerable distance thro' a very
difficult country, impeded by the enemy's
fire from the Fort, thefpirit of emulation
pervaded every different corps of the Bri
tish forces, and the mod perfect good uo
derftanding and harmony reigned among
the whole. The Midshipmen who com
manded the Gun Boats, have all been pro
moted to the rank of Lieutenants by the
Admiral, in conlideration of their good
conduit.
A confirmation of the above account I
was received by the sloop Speedwell, that
failed from Martinique on Sunday after
noon, with the additional circumftauce,
that Belgarde had lurrendered with two
hundred and fifty of his people, on condi
on u? his being sent to America ; having
been repulsed in ah attempt he made on a
party of the English who were landing
(lores for the siege, his retreat to his form
er pod wag cut off, by a (kilful evolution,
and the gates of Fort Bourbon were shut
agnrnll him. In this fituatipn several of
his party escaped to the woods, a number
were killed, and the remainder laid down
their arm*, Capt. Drew of the 45th par
ticularly diftinguilhed himfelf on the occa
fnm.
Accounts are' received of the arrival of his
royal highness Prince Edward at Barbadoes,
and of his proceeding immediately trom
thence to join the army at Martinique.
Gapt. Neil, of the ship Diligence, arrived
