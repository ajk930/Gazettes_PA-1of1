MR. FESÂ»no,
I confefs I have been a good deal sur
prised to find in ibolt every circle where
the couverfatipn happened to turn upon
politics, that the people were generally
ignorant of our having exceeded our trea
ty with the French, in permitting the iale
of prizes in our ports âand they have
started with fui prize at the aflertiorf.
this is a proof how necessary it is that
government fhonld ufeÂ«very means to en
lighten the citizens at such an important
teafon, and (hews the absolute necessity of
adopting fame plan of education for the
lower classes of the people, who are al
ways liable to be milled by designing
knaves. Let our public meetings (inch
as the state-house yard on Fuefaay last*)
and the gallery in thfe play-house, speak
more fully the claims of the people upou
this head, and even the gallery in congrefi
on a recent oceafion. The very existence
of a Republic depends upon the vii tue of
the people. Who would hot rejoice to
fee Congress occupied (if the constitution
has delegated to them the power) upon so
grand a work ? And if it h:;s not, f.ich
power might probably be obtained upon
a representation to the different States
from that body, who must have seen
eiough in this place, during their resi
dence this fellion, to convince them of the

To return to the fubjeftâThe lan
guage of a great part of our citizens up
on the late proceedings of the Briufh,
runs thus, " They have fitft interrupted
our trade to France in the carriage of
such articles as were not decreed contra
band, contrary to the pra&ice of all for
mer warsâand now they have underta
ken to fay, that we (hall not trade at all
with the French Colonies, and have pirat
ically seized our veffcls without giving us
the lead notice of their intentions, <iiid
contrary to all former usage."
It is true, they have done all this, but
it is not equally true that they are wi.hout
a prccident for adopting new things. We
have set them the example ; for accord
ing to our own confeffion, we have (in
permitting the French to !ell their prizes)
done what is " unfounded in the practice
of France, or in that of any other nati
on" that is, we have done what never any
nation did before. The British have co
pied after us, and we are now at ifTue by
the forencfs we feel, when we fisd the
lame thing retaliated upon onrfelver; we
may make some calculations, what may
be the feelings of the British in their si
tuation. To be used ill is disagreeable,
but to have no notice of tb< approach of
ill usage is very grating to our feelings â

been given by those gentlemen who exalt

might chufe it, to come forward and ob
jett to any of the resolutions, or throw
further light upon the business if they
thought proper; but they chose to keep
it all to themselves : no such offer or invi
tation was givenââ¢this to be sure is for
the honor of free difcuflion, and worthy
of the men who could produce important
resolutions & call upon the multitude to a
dopt them at the fame inftant,indeed so rea
dy were they to adopt any thing, that I am
convinced if any one had been hardy e-t
nough to present himfelf to objeii to th*
proceedings, he would have been hooted
and called an Aristocrat, English Agent,
3cc. &c. if he had ifcaped without a bro
i ken head.

For tie Caaettee of the United States.
M:. Fexno,
In this alarming crisis when war is so
much talked of that it is almost become
familiar to our ears, it is the duty of eve
fy good citizen to weigh well the causes of
the present uneafincfg in the public mind,
and the confequcnccs of an improper direc
tion being given to it. The injuries and
a.rgreftions of the Britifli government,
which have excited the mod lively sensa
tions among us are, ill. Tile detention of
the We Hern Pollsâ2d. The truce between
Putugal and Algiersâ3d. The seizure of
veflels carrying provilions to the ports of
Fra:h:eâ4th. The piratical conduct of
Britifli cruizers in the Well Indiesâjth.
The inllnidlions of 6th Nov. and the con
fcquent seizure and condemnation of our
velfels in the Welt-Indies.
1 ft. The detentionof the Pollr. This
io deemed by us a violation of the treaty
of peace; Great Britain attempts a jufti
fication. by al'edging that the United
S'ates have also violated it by laws of the
* ates, and decisions as the state courts,
rctt raining the recovery of Britilh debts ;
it is answered on the jrart of the United
States, that even admitting this to have
been the cafe, yet the detention of the
polls was an' iafraÂ£lion of the treaty, an
tecedent to any luch laws or decisions. It
mud in candor be admitted, that the con
duct of some of the dates, with refpeft to
debts, may be viewed in some measure as
1 departure from the rigid conftruAion of
the treaty ; &t the fame time, candor ought
to make allowances for the situation of
this country, ami to fugged many causes
of jullification. The date laws were in
general favorable to the mass of Britilh
creditors, for had the courts been thrown
open immediately after the peace, not a
bove one in a hundred of those creditors
would have' been paid, and the debtors
would all have.been ruined : no difcrirai
nation was made in any state against Bri
tifli creditors, but they were always placed
on the fame footing as American credit
ors. Still however, there may exist some
doubt on the subject, and it may not be so
clear a cafe as ta judify a war. It is true
the courts are all open at present to the
recovery ofdebts, but if there has been an
infra&ion of the treaty on our part at any
time lince the peace, it may furnifli a pre
text ou the other part for not immediately
fulfilling it. The fur trade is not an ob
jeS in itfelf of fufficient magnitude to in
demnify Us for a war ; the bravery of our
frontier people and our western anpy,
which has lately been fuccefsful, will keep
the Indians quiet, notwithdanding the
Britifli may continue for a few years to
hold those pods: it is not in the nature of
things that they ftiould be able to hold
them much longer : The extension of our
settlements, in their vicinity, the bold and
enterp riling disposition of the fcttlers, and
the frequent desertions of the troops which
garrison the pods, will soon induce the
Britifli government to abandon them.
2dly. The truce between Portugal and
Algiersâln moments of paflion when our
sympathy is justly excited, for the dreadful
fufferings of our unhappy countrymen, it
is natural for us to execrate and fwearven.
geance against those who have in any ref
peÂ£l been accefiary to their misfortunes.
But we Ihould view the fubjcdl, as between
tHc United States and Great Britain. To
f<y that Great Britain has let loose the Al
gerine pirates upon us, is a figure of speech
which is incorrect. Had Britain felt a
very friendly disposition towards this coun
try, it is probable she would not have mads
that truce for Portugal without stipulating
a fecurity-fer uj; but are there any ties
vfhich connect Us With Britain ? Are
there any existing causes of obligation on
her pan ? Has our conduct been fueh for
some years past, as to authorise us to ex
pett on the part of Britain, partiality, pre
ference and favor ? Let us examine our
public prints ; the inceflaut torrents of a
buse again It Britain, the accounts of toasts,
processions, and rejoicings for the defeat
of her armies, will immediately fatisfy us
that we had'no to expect that Great
Britain fhofild digiefs from the It lift line
of her owh polity to accommodate herfelf
to our's : our partiality sot France, how
ever natural it may be, has led to ftich o
pen and. avowed an imolity against. the Bri
ti(h nation, that it would have been folly
to have expeftedin return from Great Bri
tain, proofs of kindness and friend/hip.
Our government indeed, with one ex
ception, has been neutral: Mr. Jefferfon
in his correfpondance with Mr. Genet,
makes a merit of deviating from our neu
trality in allowing the sale of prizes not
warranted by treaty; and boalts of our
exertions to pay our debt to France.
These deviations ihight excite umbrage
in the other belligerent powers ; but up
on the whole, the federal government,
considering the biafs of the people, has
been highly meritorious, and their conduct
Ihould have a due effect on the Britilh
cabinet. A law has palled one branch of
the federal legitlatuie, to prevent the sale
of prizes ; if it pafi'es the other, then the
decided neutrality of the government will
be an offset againd the decided partiality
of a considerable part of the people.
How then does this question (land as
between the United States and Great Bri
tain ; the latter makes a truce in behalf of
an old friend and close ally with a formi
dable adverfarv, without llipulating a se
curity or a participation in that truce for
a nation, the inhabitants of which
manifelled the moil decided partiality for
her most bitter enemies, and the govern
ment of which has not required luch a:
security or even her mediation. Where
then is the cause of hostility!
3. "The seizure of veflela laden with
provisions forFraiVjev This measure was
adopted in pursuance of a ilipulatiori en
tered into between Great Britain, RilfEa,
Spain, &c. All those powers are anfwer--
able for it, St war ttgamil one on that score,
would be war againd all. The Britifiv
Minider attempts a juftification of it from
-the authority of writers 011 the. law of
nations, particularly 2 Vattel, 72, 73, and
urges, that by the dodlnne, there laid
down, they have not gone so far as they
would have been juftified in proceeding,
considering. the profpeft they have of re
ducing their enemy by such means, the
iaftruttions not extending to all kind of
provifious, rice being excepted, nor to
confifcations ;> that the exilling circum
flances jullify them in considering grain
as among contraband articles, and there
fore coming within the President's pro
clamation, that the Freneh government
(and not individuals) are the only impor
ters of grain into that country, that the
measure was so guarded by directing the
property to be paid for, together with the
freight, that the owners could fuffer no
loss, a liberal price being always allowed
in the cases.
Whether this explanation be or be not
confident with the law of nations, it is
not perhaps necelfary to explore ; these
remarks, however occur:
I ft. That it is not probable any ast of
our government would produce a departure
from a system eftabliftied by all the com
bined powers as one deemed by them indif
pcnfable for their own fafety.
zd. That it is aÂ« little probable, any
further inconvenience will result to us,
from this system, as the conduct of the
French government, by payments in afiig
nats, embargoes, and other acts of vio
lence, will be a fufficient restraint on our
merchants, from fending provisions to
Francc in American bottoms: It is more
probable, that the French government, a
ware of this, will continue to pursue the
wife policy they have adopted of fending
their specie, (hips and convoys to our ports
for grain.
3d. The piratical conduct of the com
manders of British cruizers in the Weft-
Indies. A complaint having been made
on this head to the British Government,
Lord Grenville requested our Minister Mr.
Pinckney, to feled some instances where
the evidence was clear, in order to rnfti
tute criminal prosecutions against the of
fenders and promised the failed support of
the law-officers of thÂ« crown. Mr. P.
informs our executive, that he was endea
vouring to fix upon some strong cases where
the evidence might be fufficient to ensure
conviction: He adds in. the fame letter
that he believes it to be the desire both of
the Briciih government and the people in
general, to be upon good terms with us;
this being the cafe, no jufl caufc of war
can arifc until it be known, that the pro
mise has not been observed.
4th. The inftru6tionÂ« of the 6th of
November, signed H. Dundas, and the
consequent Tenures.
The true import of these inftru&ions must
be firft confijiered, independent of the pro
ceedings in the Welt-Indies. The instruc
tions direct that our veflels under certain cir
cumstances (hall be carried into the Britilh
Islands "for certain adjudication" What
is the meaning of the words " legal adjudi
cation ?" Civilians lay they imply nothing
more than an adjudication by law whether a
veflel or cargo is or is not liable to condem
nation ; lawyers of eminence in this city have
given the lame opinion, the law officer of
the crown in Jamaica, gives the fame opini
on ; he fays that to guard against the irregu
lar conduct of commanders of cruizers, they
are direÂ£ed to carry neutral veflels fulpe&ed
of having enemy's property or contraband
goods on board into port for trial, and that
the inftru&ions mean nothing more; Lord
Grenville, who probably drew up the instruc
tions, in a note to Mr. Pinckney, speaking of
some American veflels in London, which
had been libelled in the Admiralty Court,
fays they were in a ccurfe of legal adjudica
tion, meaning only that they were under trial.
So far then it is clear that the inflruftions, in
themselves, do not breathe hostility.
As to the proceedings in the vice-admiral
ty courts in the Weft-Indies, information
varies ; by some accounts it is said, that there
have been no condemnations, except in Mont
ferrat, by others we are informed, that they
have taken place in some other Islands.
The Judges of these Courts may have
proceeded to condemnation from ignorance
or corruption ; it is well known that the
persons lent out # to the British colonies as
Judges, are not generally the heft lawyers or
the best men ; they are frequently diflipated
extravagant, debauched, and ignorant per
sons of influential connexions, who have in
iereft enough to get these appointments. This
was generally the cafe with us while colonies,
and was one of the curses we got rid of by
our independence; it is among the curses
which the remaining colonies groan under.
No on'* will deny that the conduct of some
â¢of these Judge-lings has been infamous and
abominable, and that the British government
ought upon information of their proceedings,
"to dismiss and punish them. But is their con
du& a cause cjf war ? We are precluded from
faying that it is. When the British govern
ment complained that some of our inferior
Courts had established decrees which were an
infraction oÂ£ the treaty of peace, N\liat was
the answer of our Executive ? " No nation,
fays Mr. JefferSon, in his letter to Mr. Ham
mond, page 56, answer. for perfect exac
titude of proceedings in all their inferior
Courts : It fuffices to provide a Jupreme ju
dicature, where all error and partiality will
be ultimately corre&ed." We cannot then
complain of a refufal to do justice on the
part of the British Cabinet, until an appeal
has been made from the Vice-Admiralty
Courts in the Weft-Indies, which are inferior
Courts, to the Admiralty Courts in England.
This is certainly a grievance of no inconsi
derable magnitude to the parties, and many
of them will probably be induced by the
trouble and expence to abandon their vessels
to the captors. But, in a cafe like the pre
sent, our government should interpose its aid
and affifl the fufferers. The Executive would
be fully authorized, under such circumstan
ces, to advance money to the Captains or
owners of the condemned vessels for the pur
pose of prosecuting appeals : If the Supreme
Court of Admiralty, as Mr. J. fays, corrects
the error of partiality of the inferior Courts
and awards restitution and damages, we are
bound by our own do<Strines, to be content :
If the iniquitous sentences be confirmed, and
the Cabinet of St. James's, on a demand,
refufe full compensation for the vessels and
cargoes which have been unjustly seized, then
hostility and retaliation against that nation
will be juftifiable, and all parties will be uni
ted in the most vigorous efforts to obtain re
dress for our violated rights.
These are the measures which ought- im
mediately to be pursued, and while the ifiue
of them remains uncertain, the country
ought to be put in a condition to defend it
felf again!! invalion, and to afiert its dignity.

Wednesday, January 29.
The SPEECH of Mr. Smith, of South'
Carolina, in reply to Mr. on
the fubjcd of the Commercial Regulations.
[continued]
The gentleman had been much diipleaf
ed at his having commented on the omifli
on of the Secretary of State to mention
that while the ttbaen of the United State*
paid iii Great Britain a duty of i/jÂ» ' all
other foreign tobacco paid $/5. As an
apology for that omission, (which Mr.
Smith could not but deem material, espe
cially as the Secretary laid great ftrefa on
other duties,) the gentlemau had ailedgÂ«d
that the circumltance was perfc&ly imma
terial, inafmnch as the duty of l/j was
itfelf so high as to diminish the conlump
tion, and inafmueh as there was no otlier
country which could be our competitor in
that article. To this he answered, firlt,.
that tobacco being an artiele not of necef-
Cty but of caprice, and being consumed
in Wiall quantity by each individual a
high duty, could not be felt ; secondly,
that tobacco was obtainable from other
countries ; it appeared from documents of
authority, that in the years 1744, 5, 6,
the imports of tobacco into Great Bri
tain had been annually kbont 62,000
hogsheads, of wheh only 44,000 were
â¢ from the American colonies', the refiduc,
18,000 being from other countries. From
the fame documents it further appeared
that in 1774 Great Britain imported
from the American colonies 96,000 hogs
lieads which was nearly the whole of the
tobacco (lie imported that year: The in
ference resulting from this circumstance
was, that the difference of duty in favor of
American tobacco had then destroyed a
competition which did before exiji. He
admitted that this discrimination of duties
in our favor was a reliA of her colony sy
stem, but it's object was to encourage the
growth of tobacco in this country, by
giving to it a monopoly of the Britilh
market, and it appeared that this object
was obtained ; and it was to be inferred,
that a continuance of Ae effect was pro
cured by a continuance of the system. If
we have not much competition now, it
does not follow that it might not arise.
What was there to hinder it's being raised
on equally good terms in any quantity in
any of the southern ports of this conti
nent in poflcflion of the different powers
of Europe, Spain, Portugal, Holland ?
Portugal, it had been said, could not
be our competitor, tor (lie received our
tobacco ; the report fays that it is prohi
bited ; he tlridcrftood some small quantity
had been smuggled to that country ; it
was certain that only 62 hoglheads had
been exported thither the year before last,
and only 5 the lalt year. In comparing
the footing on which our conirhercc stood
with Fiance and Great Britain, the geni
tlemao had dwelt on particular circtimftan
ces; that was not a fair mode of compa
rison, the queftton ought to be an aggre
gate one ; are we as well upon the tiihoh
with this or that country! If we are; we
ought not to deal out a W9rfe measure to
one tlian to another. The indireS com
merce which Great Britain denies us, and
which France till lately granted us, is not
at present very material to ui, at we could
not multiply our navigation enough to de
rive great benefit from it, without injury;
to divert our capital from more profitable
branches to the mere sarrying trade would
be unwise ; 'tis defireable only to a coun
try, like Holland, of little production
and great capital j but even France now
excludes us from the indirect commerce
with her by her late navigation ast : The
systems of the two countries, then, in ref
peft to the navigation in Europe, (land
precisely on the fame footing ; and in ref
pedl to their Weft-Indies, the war has
let our veflels into the British as well a*
the Frencn Islands, and there can be little
doubt that our right to fend our vessels to
the French I Hands will terminate with the
war.

December 29.
Barrere appeared at the tribune. Citi
zens, said he, you have heard with rap
ture the successes at Toulon, you will
learn with courage the check we have re
ceived at Perpignan. If the Mediterra
nean is free, and the Eaittrn Pyrenees are
still in (lavery, it is in the midil of vicissi
tudes that Republican minds receive a
double temper and life with renovated vi-
gour.
The courage of a chofcn body of our
troops had retaken Villelongue, but new
treachery has surrendered places in the de
partment of the Eastern Pyrenees. Per
pignan is threatened. The treacherous
commander Datfaux surrendered the fort
St; Elme, after having fired on our troops
with cafe (hot. Thus the most ignorant
of all the fuldiers of Europe, the moll
luperilitious people in the world, have a-
Jone obtained any success on the foil of li
berty ; but orders are already given, eve
ry thing is at this moment changed, re
prcfentatives, generals, etat-major, troops,
all is regenerated : The iron of France
will overcome the gold of Mexico ; and
the (laves of Madrid will soon (brink from
the presence of the conquerors of Toulon.
If the Vendee iÂ« deitroyed, as I have
confirmed to you by the report of the Re
presentatives of the people and generals.
If the interior parts ot the Republic are
fhortlv to be entirely eleanfed from the
filth of Royalifm and purged from thecoun
ter-revolntionary leaven, wha thavc we to
fear ? A formidable army is about to ap
pear at the foot of the Eastern Pyrenees.
We hourly expeÂ£t happy tidings from the
Rhine. The North will feel our strength
in its turn, and the eoafts will be preserved.
Barrere then communicated the letters
of the General division d'Aout, of Boif
fet, and of the representatives of the peo
ple at eastern Pyrenees. They inform
that Bagnols, port Vendre, Callioure are
in the hands of the Spaniards. The forts
have been surrendered: The army is en
tirely routed : It is fulpe&ed that some
persons are highly criminal. It is not
known what has become of Fabre,
and Gallon is blocked up in Perpignan.
Thegreateft expedition has been used in
putting Aignes-mortes, Cette and Agde
in a Hate of defence.
BRUSSELS, Dec. 31.
Exttaft of an authentic letter.
It is utterly in vain for the Emperor to
trust to the resources of his own dominions,
for they are exhausted, and unless he is coun
tenanced in making a loan in England, his
efforts mud be feeble. The King of Prussia
does not disguise his meaning. He eith r is,
or effedls to be poor, and he fays explicitly
that he must be subsidized : and we are given
to understand that the Britiih Ministers are
resolved to go on, and that a treaty for fnbfi
dizing Pruflia is actually in negociation.
Ot the events which have palled in France
we have the molt affli&ing accounts. No
thing' can refill the impetuosity of the Re
publicans. Every where they have been fuc
cefcful. We cannot give you a perfedt idea
of the gloom that has ovcrlpread this place
| by the news from Toulon, and no less dis
astrous accounts from the Rhine. No less
than 30,000 men of the combined armies of
Europe have fallen within the last fortnight.
Not less than 50,000 fouls in all have within
the last fourteen days of this diftafterous year
perished, and so far has this butcher)' been
from promoting the objetf s of the war, that
it has aknoft to a certainty secured the tri
umph of Republican!fin in France. We are
difgraceful'.y expelled from the Mediterrane
an frontier ; and letters from the Rhine fay,
that .after the fatal 24th, Wurmfer had rc
folved, by a Council of War to try the iflhe
of only one more attack, to retrograde with
all the force, and to resume the strong por
tion at Weiflembourg, here to make his last
delperate stand. On the 24th, according to
daily custom, he was attacked by 30,000
Frenchmen, though he had been reinforced
by the troops of the Palatinate and by the
Prince de Conde, and fought the whole day
with his usual courage and obstinacy, his line
was broken. His left wing in part composed
by the troops of the Palatinate, was by the
enemy, charged, and routed towards the
evening; and nothing but the night saved
them from total ruin. Their loss was con
siderable. The Emigrants alio left 500 on
the fieldâand the whole army is so extenu
ated, and reduced by those daily attacks, so
harraifing as well as so murderous, that we
have loft all hopes of the capture of Landau,
or of being able to continue in France.

S I R,
WE, the subscribers, exhausted by dai
ly application! on the iuhjedt of our fitna
tions, and finding not only otn future
pvofpefts defeated, but extreme misery
ftaiing us in the fkceâwe do now, All of
us, call upon you as our organ to speak
through, to demand of the Representa
tives of the people, whether we are to be
couiidcrcd as friends or enemies: if the
former, you are then to claim the fulfil
ment of the treaties existing between the
two Republicsâif the latter, you will
thou demand a futficient number of ships
to carry us and our people home, and we
will without delay, abandon our veflels and
p opeities, and seek that jultice from our
own government, which is denied u> here.
We also obforvt(witli aikunilhment, that
partialities are going forward, and that
particular interests are gratified without a
ny reason forfo doing, that will bear day
light. Sir, it is your duty, asCohfulof
the United States, and it is becoming you
as a man, to look into these transactions,
and if the representatives have been de
ceived, to set them right; for it is obvious
to all of us, that since their arrival, the
eld regime has been overthrown, which
dealt out jobbj and favors to particular in.
dividuals at the expence of the many; and
as Americans, we are all equal, and there
ought to be no preferei ce.
We make not these observations from
jealousy against our fellow-citizens who
have got away and are now going; but
for the lake of truth and juflice, which it
is your duty to do us, and your duty to
the repiVentatives to make known. And
we further add, Sir, that your personal
character will be implicated, if you do not
fulfil our wiflieson this head.

Gentlemen,
I have received your letter of this inft.
and note your remonstrances. I lincerely
with I had the means of relieving your
present situation as Consul of the United
States. I have exhausted every means of
conciliatory negotiation with the supreme
executive authority now in this depart
â ment, and I have regularly communicated
our situation in my correspondence to our
Miniiler Plenipotentiary at Paris, "without
receiving any positive assurances of a spee
dy redress of our grievances. lam ftiU
prepared \o adopt and execute with that
celerity our critical situation demands, any
other measures confident with-my situa
tion, that may be thought for the public
good. If the measures we have hereto
fore pursued, have not been produ&ive
of that jullice we, as friends to the French
nation, ire entitled to, I have done my
duty, and not neglected the important in
terelt my country has placed under my
care, which my correfpondeiice will clear
ly manifeft j and as to you, gentlemen, I
am equally allured, that your general
conduct has been such, as to leave <10
ground or even colour of reproach, for the
long and rigorous detention we have ex
perienced here.
Wehave, in myopinion, ftillontmortduty
to do, which is to join our efforts in other
friendly measures to obtain redress as long
as we have the means of keeping possessi
on of our vefTels; then in the cause of fai
lure, we lhal! be jullified towards ourselves,
our famil:Â» i, and "our country; for the a
bvidon-'ng our vefTels, and seeking my o.
t'ie# mode of living, and returning ho Ac,
that our circumttances and prudence may
dictate. I therefore propose to vou,
that we aflemhle three times a week, (fay
every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday
evening) to concert mcafures of redrefj,
and that as ourcafe is important and prcf

alleys in the City and Liberties. The (itaation
of the several public buildings, such as the State-
Houle, City-Hall, Seat of Congress, Churches,
Meeting-Houses, Hospital. Library and Seen in a
lies of Learn.ogâof the several Banks, and of
the Federal and State Offices, will be ascertained.
The parts which are built on will be distinguish
ed from those that are not. The courfrs of the
rivalcts between Delaware and Schuylkill, and
as much of the Canal, intended to conned the
navigation of these two waters, as lies within
the compass of the draught, will be accurately
delineated. It will also be ornamented by a
view of the (hipping in the harbor, and an ele
vation of Congress-Hall, and of the other public
buildings that occupy the ground contiguous.
In (hort, nothing will be omitted to render this
ufeful and deferable work acceptable to an en
lightened public, that is in the author's power :
and it (hall be compleated with the greatest
potfibie difpatcb, as soon as the generous encou
ragement of fubfenbers (hall insure to tbeauthor
such a sum as will be fufficicnt to defray ex

AN ESSAY ON THE

Aliquid semper ad commnnem ntilitatem af
ferendum. Cicero.
The F'trft American Edition.
THE grand principle of Equality,lf right
ly understood, is the only bails on which
universal justice, sacred order, and perfect
freedom, can be $rmly built, and permanent
ly fecored. The view of it exhibited in this
elTay, at the fame time that it reprefles the
infolencc of office, the tyranny of pride, and
the outrages of oppression ; confirms, in the
most forcible manner, the neceffiry of fubor
dinatioo, and the just demands of lawful au
thority. So far indeed, from loosening the
bands of society, that it maintains inviolate,
every natural and every civil diftintfion,
draws more closely every (ocial tie, unites in
one harmonious and justly proportioned sys
tem, and brings men together on the even
ground of the inherent rights of human na
ture, of reciprocal obligation, and of a com
mon relation to the community.
