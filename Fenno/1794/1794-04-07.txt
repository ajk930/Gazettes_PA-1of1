The Public are cautioned to
beware of counterfeited Five Dollar Bills of
the Bank of the United States, and Twenty
Dollar Bills of the Bank of North America,
federal of which have appeared in circulation
within a few days past ; they are a good ge
neral imitation of the genuine Bills, but may
be dtjlinguijhed by the following .
MARKS.
Five Dollar Bills of the Bank qf the
United States.
ALL that have appeared have the letter F.
for their Alphabetical Mark.
The Texture of the Paper is thicker and
whiter and it takes the ink more freely than
the genuine paper.
Tiie O. in the word Company is smaller
han theM. and other letters of that word,
o that a line extended from the top of (he O,
to touch the top of the M would extend con
fidsiably above the range of the wjiqle word.
In the word United the letters are narrow
erand closer together than the reft of the bill
The i and Jin the word promise are not
parallel, the yinclining much more forward
than thf >.
The engraving is badly executed,the strokes
of allelic Letters are stronger and the devioe
in the margin particularly ismuch coaricr and
appears darker than in the true bill?. Some
ot eh counterfeits bear date in 1751âWhere
as tho Bank was not in operation till Decem
ber, and no five dollar bills were issued in
that year.
Twenty J)ollar Bills of tlx Bank <f North
America.
ALL that have appeared have the letter
B. for their alphabetical mark.
They are printed on a paper nearly similar
to that of the counterfeit Five Dollar Notes
above described ; the engraving is better exe
cuted, and they approach nearer to the ap
pearance of the genuine bills.
The fine ruled lines through the word Twen
ty, in the body of the hill, are in number thir
teen in tbe genuine bills, and but twelve in
the counterfeits.
The word Company is much like the fame
word in the Five Dollar Bills as defer ibed a
bove, the o being lp/f than th? w, aud others
fallowing.
There is no stroke to the / in the word North
whereas in the genuine bills tbe stroke is well
defined.
The letters cnt in the word Twenty, to the
left hand at the bottom, do t}oi come down to
the line, but are so cut as to give an irregular
appearance to the word, the Tw and they go
ing below them.
The Signature j Nixon, has the appear
ance of being written with lamp black and
oil, and differs from the other inksufedin
printing the biils and the calhier's iignature.
It is i'uppofed these forgeries were committed
in feme ot the Southern States, as all the Â©ouff
terfcits thai have appealed* haye come from
thence, and tyo persons have been apprehend
ed in Virginia, on suspicion of being the authors
of them.

PARIS, Jan. 5.
Atnand-Louis Philip.Culline, jun. bom
at Parisâ 25 years of age, formerly Mi
nister Plenipotentiary of Louis XVI. at
Berlin, Adjutant-General of the army an
the Rhine, has, for Manoeuvres, Conspi
racies, &c. been Sentenced to foffer death.
The Revolutionary Tribunal has passed
sentence of death against Charles Barre,
Receiver of Contributions in the diftvidt
of Laffy, department of Mayence, for
conspiracy against the Republic ; against
Rene Foizer, from Poitiers, an Ex-noble,
for having assisted the Rebels of LaVea
dee; against Charles Faverolles, a native
of Paris, and a Constitutional Priest, and
Aid-de-Camp of Dumourier ; and against
Agatha Jolivat, the divorced wife of Bar
reau de Crevy, for criminal correspondence
with the enemies of the Repnblic. The
old Marshal Luckner has also been con
demned to death.
Another letter. from Toulon, datad
Dec. 24, states, that the executions go
on brifldy ; on the 21ft, 130 soldiers aild
citizens were shot; and on the 23d, fif
teen marine officecrs {hared the fame fate.
On the 23d, two Spanish Brigs with
provisions, and On the 23d, five large
Ships, three Spanish and two <jf them
English, coming with tro<>ps from Turk),
also entered the harbor, and were well re
ceived by the Republicans.
v The Combined Fleets are said to have
failed in a dreadful itorm, which did not
ceafc till the 23, they are supposed to
have borne towards the Island of Hieres;
a large (hip, dismasted, has been seen
from Toulon, seven leagues from theihore.
Anacharfig CloQts, too, it is said, will
be tried before the Revolutionary Tribu
nal. With refpeft to Thomas Paine, it
is generally believed that nothing will be
done again ft him for the present.
One of the chiefs of La Vendee, who
lately summoned Nantz, has been taken
piifoner, and (hot at Ancenis.
A letter from Ciotat, near Toulon, da
ted Dec. 23, announced, that on the 2.oth,
twenty-five marine officers .were (hot; that
upwards of 200 Spanish women remained
at Toulon, and upwards of 2000 sick and
wounded who had not time to embark ;
tfot the harbor is full of dead bodies ;
that upwards of 20,000 of the inhabitants
are said to have emigrated The enemyHHH|
is dated to have carried off seven or eight
/hips of. the line, among which are, Le
Commerce de Marseilles, La Pompee,
Le Conquerant, and a great nurtiber of
smaller vefiels.
SITTING of the JACOBINS.
At the Jacobins, said thit for
a long time past, Camille Defmoulins had
grazed the guillotine; and he denounced
him, for having; in one of his papers,
with a criminal intention, furnilhed arms
to the aristocrats. Collot d'Herbois and
Hebert vindicated the characters of Ron
fin and Vineent, arrested by order of the
committee 6f fjiiblic tafety. Hebert ac
cused Fahre d'Eglantine, of having ne
ver atchieved any civic a&ion, but com
posed many counter-revolutionary publica
tions. He denounced Defmoulins, who
since he had married a rich lady, had be
come the friend of aristocrats ; despised
tht true Jacobins, and ridiculed the minis
ter Botichatte. He' attacked Bourdon
de l'Oife for having calumniated Ronfin,
deposed Roflignol, and insulted the best
patriots.
The fame charges were repeated against
the fame persons at the Cordeliers. Ca
mille Dcf-noulins, who had proposed to
purchase back from the Englifli, the town
of Toulon for three millions, and of course
for one million more than they had given
for it, was struck off the lift. The im
mense fortune of Fabre d'Eglantine was
again mentioned ; it was asserted, that in
Augnitj 1792, he had 110 (hoes, and was
indebted to ail old cloaths-rtien. His sen
tence was adjourned till the next fitting
of the Jacgbins. '
A letter from Tours, dated the 17th
instant, states, that the Royalists have
fci2cd all the vessels, they fotind on the
rivets Isle and Vilaine ; put them on wag
gons, carts, &e. and taken them for the
purpose of making use of tliem to re-pass
tiie .Loire ; and that the rebel general
n Charnttr, was in light of Mortagne,
with a:: army of 12,000 men.
On the 14th inftar.t, the town of Ren
nes was declared to be in a state of siege,
which inclines us to fear, that the royal- ;
ifts â¢vt'hti were said to have been drowned
in the Loire, are approaching that town
in confideraHe force. 'Thfc measure has :
perhaps, been occasioned by their march
to Morbihan, which was announced to
the convention in the fittifig of the 22d.
In the vrry fame fitting were read, letters
from the vommiflloners' at Alenton, an
nouncing feme dispositions made by them,
which proves that ifi that quarter, there'
exitt* another army of toyalifts. We fee,
c'lerefore, one column of them directing
its march towards the eoafts of Britanny,
by the way of' L'Orierit, whilst another
is marching towards the coAst of Lower
Normandy, and bears down upon Cher
bourg. AU this iifcredits those reports,
which rcprefents the insurgents of La
Vendee to beat their last gasp.
Citizen Durand, adjutant-general of
â¢the avmv in Italy, lias been appointed
temporary commandant of Marseilles.
December 23.
Read a lettrr from general Ronfin,
whertin he refuted the charges against
him, contained in Phr'Hppeaux's report
to the convention.
Fouche, representative of the people at
Lyons, announced the death of Gaillard,
who, thinking himfelf abandonad by the
Jacobins, haddeftroyed himfelf. Gaillard
was the best friend of Chalier. On the
lothof August he was the firft whomount
ed to the affauk against the tyrant of the
Thuilleries, and he was there severely
wounded.
Collot d'Herbois, after Fouche's letter
had been read, caused all the members of
the society to take an oath never to survive
one of their brethren who (hould be at
tacked, and then proceeded in the follow
ing terms :
" I came here with the fame hopes I
entered the Convention. But the Con
vention 1 found futrcunded by its enemies
âa,nd you I found debating whether you i
ought to approve the mcafiircs we had ta- ,
ken. You ceased for a moment to be
strong, and the death of Gaillard was the 1
result of your weakness- ,
" 111-difpofcd people endeavor to alie
nate your minds from the Convention 1
you have countenanced libels, which have 1
disunited you, and armed you against one ;
another, and have accused the committee
of publie fafety of having filed the blood i
of Patriots. Old histories have been c
f-arch<'d in order to establish a contrast be- t
twee 11 times " loig'pSft," and that where- f
n we live. They endeavor to mitigate :

tue .revolutionary movements. Wlio can
direct a thunder storm ?âAVell, such is ,
iiie revcriiioa. It' b flights mull pot ije
pr.eckjc, Far be it fjorp us to have an
idea L/f rnodeiit.i, Let ua remain Ja
cobins, let fas rem?.!n mountaineers, and,
save liberty." (Loud applaules.)
A member applauded these proportions
and again attacked Defmoulins
for having been moved to pity by the fate
ot the Cxirondilts ; he demanded the
judgment of every one who lhould pity
the fate of conspirators.
LevafTeur accuftd Phillippc *tix of hav
ing caused two deputies to vote for the ap
peal to the people, and,having treated du
ring a dinner, general* konhn and KofTg
nol like criminals, and the Jacobins'like
rogues.
Philippeaux maintained the truth of
a'l the facts contained in his report against
Ronfin. He declared, that he always vo
ted like a good mountaineer. He accus
ed the generals in La Vendee of having
filed the blood of 30,000 Republicans, &
of having lavished the public money.
Ronfin and RofTigno], he laid were con
stantly plunged in pleasures, and never at
the head of their armies, except on the
18th, when the former discovered the fe- .
cret of ckufing an army of 43,000 to be
cut to pieces by 3000 banditti, by placing
his army, artillery and baggage in a valley ;
inftcad of making himfelf mailer of the
heights, from which the rebels launched
the thunderbolts which destroyed our.
troops. He attributed to their stupidity,
that the banditti had passed the Loire,
for which purpose they had given them
two whole days. He denied the insolent
speech against the Jacobins with which
LevafTeur reproached him.
Hebert, called upon by LevafTeur, as
serted the truth of this reproach. The
fitting became stormy. Danton demanded .
the profoundeft calm> to hear this import- :
ant difcufiion.
Roberfpievre spoke to the fa (he purport.
He excused the intentions of Philippeaux,
but he Would have him prove his aiTertion,
that the committee of public fafety, th'ro'
mere obstinacy, had caused the deltruftion
of 30,000. ' Citizens,' he added,' whence
originate the commotions which agitate
you within a few days ? You are surround
ed here by the foreign powers. They
have placed you between the Moderantifm
which is borne down, and tht PctTlirem
treachery of those men, who set all in con
fufion. Phe taflics of our enemies contiit
in endeavoring to divide 11s, and to make
us destroy each other by our own hands."
Roberfpierre then declared, that all the
arrests complained of, had been decreed
alter a long difculfion in the committees.
He demanded, that the society should re
ly on the Convention and the Mountain,
and hear Philippeaux.
Philippeaux said, that on his return
from La Vendee, he had perceived in the
committee of public fafety a repelling kind
of .orms 5 that having not been able to
get a hearing, he had published his com
plaint in a pamphlet, of which he had no
more copies printed tliau were neceflary
for his colleagues.
" Tbou lieft," exclaimed LevafTeur
" thou haft even sent some copies to Samur
and Angers." (Murmurs.)
Philippeaux. " I will explain to you
the reafbn of Levaffeur's wrath against
me : I have caused a decree to be report
ed against the principles of an accumula
tion of farm-contra&s. This oepration
has caused to him the loss of an income of
500 livres a year. (Violent murmurs.)
Danton quoted the example of the Ro
mans, who forgot their private quarrels
when the enemy were at their gates :
The enemy are also at our gates, and we
are persecuting each other. Do all our
altercations kill one single Pruflian ? (Loud
applaufcs)âHe demanded the efiablifh
ment of a committee to terminate the
quarreL
Bouthon asked Philippeaux, whether,
in his fbirl and confcienca, he really be
lieved that there had been any treafbn
committed in La Vendee I do," aii
fwered Philippeaux. Â« Then I demand
also a committee." This was decreed un
der the loudest acclamations of applaufc.
Collot.d' Herbois appeared at the bar,
to undergo the purificatory scrutiny.
He was received with the loudest buift <Â»f
applause.
Hebert moved, that while Collot was
upon the Tribune, he should give an ac
count of his operations at ,Lyous, and of
the inftru&ions he might have in his pcf
feffion refpefting General Ronfin.
Collot d'Herboisâ" I congratulate my-
fclf, Citizens, that you have enabled me
ro.unbofoui myfeif with franknefs in the
toiJft of yob ! After two moQthsVbltncc
from "aris, for the piirpofe of fulfilling
th<' tailc with which yt. U: had charged ir.e,

j you to Lyons, to display the measures of

J 1 he evil was at a pitch when I arWved in
I that city ; even now it is not less high at
I Lyons, and in all the Southern Depart-
I merits.
I " Attempts have been made to draw
your pity upon the fate of the rebels, and
I those ideas of moderatifm fec?m to have
ftruclc many. We find it alledged agsiihft
I us a cume, .to have mace the Lyontle
J traitors perilh in a military manner; it
I was a matter of complaint, that they did
J not fall by the fidt discharge but is not

j The rebels do not die at the firft discharge:
But Charlier did he not die at the firft

on pur million, would we have fallen at
One stroke ? The fenaticized Lyonefe wo
men have Charlotte Corde for their sole
patroness.
I Paris is the rendezvous of a great num-
J ber of Lycnefe. In concert with the re-
I latives of the traitors, they seek so often
| the Convention. I have been aflced here
to explain myfeif with regard to Ronfui;
here ought 1 to present to you, reflections
J that coincide well with the fecfret tricks
I which the federalifts excvcife in the midst

I Ronfin fetout from Lyons, it wasreport-
I that he had bten lunimonÂ£d to appear
j at the bar ; and no fooiicr did he arrive '
j thaw he woa put under nrrett. -
I ail these facts collated be accounted for ? .
Ronfin lias well perfonned his duty; he
was in the full latitude of the Revolution,
I and the ariftocratscaufed him to bearreft
j ed. The Lyonefe alone beheld him with
terror; and for this he incurred their ha
tred.

The French aunv on the frontier of

It is a too cbitain truth, that the valottr
and discipline of the allies have not been
able to refill the great superiority of tHÂ»
French upon the Rhine. Though several

the vexations and spoliations which . your. I
Commerce has experienced, you will doubt
lels receive With pleafrtrt some edai'rciJe
ments on the complaints %vell or ill founded,
which have bÂ»en brought against the priva
teers & 2 (hips of war of the French Repub
lic. You will not o'oferve with lei's plealure
in my reply, that the National Convention
has already done- justice t(J foif.e of the de
mands of the merchants of the United States,
and are now occupied in i"ati9iying some o
thers.
In the lift of complaints against the repub
lic, of Franee the complainants urge that .the
French privateers do net less harrafs your
con\merce than thofj of the Engli/h.
To this assertion I answer by two observa
tions which I l'ubmit to your impartiality.
I. It is now some time since any more
privateers have failed out of the puns of
France, and the number of thole which have
been armed in our Islands is not to be com
pared with those pirates which the illand of
Bermuda aiorte fends forth.
a. If any of your merchants have fuffered
any injury by the conduct of our privateers,
(a thing which would be .contrary to the in
tention and express orders of the Republic)
they may with confidence, address theml'elves
to the French government, which will never
refufe justice to those whose claims lhall be
legal. _ '
I feel a pleasure in thinking, and faying
to you, that it is not the fault oÂ£ the French,
if commercial property, even of enemy-na
tions, has not been refpeifted amidit the hor-.
ro:% of w^r.
This proposition of natural right was made
by one of out' legillative aflembiies to the
Britiih, who rejeifid it. i
idly. It is imputed to tiuo tf our /hips of
<u>ar that they have Committed enormities on
your vejjels. y
Should the fatft be proved, the Captains
of those two vellHs are as culpable towards
France as they are towards the United States,
for having sifted In a manner contrary to the
inftrÂ«(ftions thty have received: The govern
ment, upon information of the crime, will
fnoft certainly punish the authors of it. It
would Be unjust to accuse a nation generally
taf the aist of some individuals, when that
nation disavows their condudV, and repairs
the wrongs which they have committed.

Copy agreeable to the original,
Jh. Fauchet.
The 4th allegation, would require a long
SLulic'n which I lhali not undertake here.
âI lhali only indulge myfelf in this Angle
refkclion, that the horrible system of viola
ting the law of nations in order to starve a
people Who cannot be conquered by force of
arms, has not been invented lay.France, and
that it would be as unjust as barbarous to
require that (he Ihould allow provisions to
pass to tef ehemies, while thole destined for
Her are taken by them.
As to the embargo on American veflels,
imperious cii/ umiUnces, the falvatipn of the
Country, have imposed that measure; but the
interests of no one will be injured ; and to
Convince you of this, I recite an extra# of a
letter which I have just received from citi
zen Taiiien Rcprelentative of the people at
Bordeaux.
ft is pofiible.he writes me," That fomema
' levolem persons may make ufeof this pretext
(.the embargo) to lit urb the harmony exift
mg between the Americans and us, or might
represent this measure as a violation, of trea
lies between the two nations ; the interest of
individuals may for a moment cause the ge
neral interest to disappear. It is then to"you
J>rave Republican and the true triendof your
country, that we mult consign the care of de
fending it to Congress ((hould the measure
happen to be there calumniated) fay to our
brethren that it is the intention of the com
mittee of public fafety, the actual center of
the French government to indemnify all the
Owners or captains who by the operation of
the embargo have been obliged to remain a
lergth of time in France, and that the pro
pohtions which soon will be made to them in
the name of the committee will be advanta
geous to both nations. In (hort, my friend, â 
Use every means of a frank republican nego
rator to convince our brethren the Ameri- 1
tans, that when occupied concerning the se
gregate interests of the nation, we do notfor- 1
get the,rs, and they may be assured, that they
*.11 always find ,n us faithful obfervera of
treaties made with nations worthy of li
7'he fifth and last allegation is that a con .
(raft the payment of which bavin? been /V
puhfed in cqjh, has been made in nffi.rrJs â 
I am unacquainted with the fact, but I am
*fiared, that it is the intention of the N ti- f

AN ESSAY ON THE
Natural Equality of Men,
On the Rights that result from it, and on the
Duties which it imposes.
To which a MEDAL was adjudged, by the
Teylerian Society at Haarlem.
CorrcSed and Enlarged.

Aliquid Temper ad communsm utilitatem at- ,
ferendum. Cicero.
The Firjl American Edition.
THE grand principle of Equality, if right
ly understood, is the only basis on which
universal justice, sacred order, and perfect
freedom, can be firmly built, and permanent
ly lecured. The v.ew of it exhibited in this
eflay, at the fame time that it reprtffcs the
insolence of office, the tyranny of pride, and
the outrages of oppression } coÂ»firmÂ«, 111 the
nioft forcible manner, the necessity oi fubor
diriation, and the just demands ot lawful au
thority. So far iodeed, from loosening the
bands of society, that it maintains inviolate,
every natural and every civil dilbnflion,
draws more clofeJy every fociiÂ»l tie, unites in
one harmonipus and juflly proportioned fyi
tem, and brings men together on the even
ground Of the inherent rights of human na
ture, of reciprocal obligation, and of a com
inon relation to the community.
