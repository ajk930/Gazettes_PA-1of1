HOUSE of COMMONS, April 3.
RETURNS.
Major Maitland faid,he rose under some
expectation that Mr. Pitt would recede
from the opinion lie firll entertained, and
concur in the motion he was about to
submit.
It was not his intention, he said, to
bring forward again any proposition for
printing the returns of the killed and
wounded, and the extracts of the gazettes
relating to the war, as in his ensuing mo
tion on the general conduct of the cam
paign, he fliould be authorised to avail
himfelf fully of those documents in their
present (late, but the returns of our lofies
of stores and ammunition at Dunkirk and
Toulon were accounts of a different de-,
fcription, and which it was.highly impor
tant to the full investigation of the fubjedi
that he (hould poflefs; though he declin
ed bringing forward the two fir ft fubje&s,
he yet thought that t,hofe motions
were very improperly rejected, whether
hs regarded them in a general view,
or as precedents, in both of which
cases, he disclaimed all personal influ
ence, as to him they would be entirely
ufelefsou this oceafion, however neccflary
thev might be to the general infoimation
of the House. Ke could not, at the fame
time, forbear expressing his aftonilhnient
that they should have been refufed by mi
nisters in opposition to the general feeling
of the House and country j and whsn, in
fadt, as to the firlt, it was known by the
return of the killed and wounded, that the
number was much smaller than what the
public generally conceived, for which he
was now about to' move. The returns
would be to him more necefiary rs he ex
pected to hear his motion opposed by as
sertion and declamation, instead of argu
rngnt and fart In this view, therefore.
they would be highly important, and could
not be refnfed unless it was contended,
that the House and country have not a
right to be informed of every circumflance
relating to the operations of the armies
they employ ; they became also more ne
ceflary, when- it is recollected that the
Gazette account of thelofles of the retreat
from Dunkirk had been declared errone
ous in the instance of the number of guns
left behind by the very officer (Sir James
Murray) who wrote that account. He
profeffed himfelf at a loss to suggest any
ground of opposition to the motion, as the
enemy could receive no information from
the difclofurr, which could only apprise
the House and the country of tliofe fadts
with which the enemy had been long ac
quainted.
From this view of the fubjeft be repeat
ed his hopes that his motion would receive
no opposition, and that Mr. Pitt would
retraCt the opinion of it which he had be
fore exprefled.
He concluded by moving, " That an
humble address be presented to his majesty
lequefting that he would give directions
that there be laid before the House returns
of the number of guns and military stores
left at Dnnkirk and 1 oulon refpeCHvelv,
on the retreat of the British forces from
those places."
Mr. Pitt declared himfelf, on reconsi
deration, confirmed in the opinion he for
merly exprefTed on this fubjea, and by no
means mclinrd to retratt it. What fell
from the Hon. Gentleman, had rather
ttrengthened his former opinion, as he had
confeffed that it would be ufelef# to him
ir the two firft accounts were printed ; if
any compromise, therefore, were to take
place, he e*peded it would be br an ac
cession of numbers tohisf.de, rather than
any detection from it.
He objeaed to printing the return of â 
kdled and wounded, as being fuperflnous, i
aru, as unwise, by llifhifmg the knowledg-e
of the inevitable evils of war, when no ]
good consequence would arise from it It ,
was true, in this cafe, the calamities were ,
In" than were apprehended ; but s
as he fliould not have felt his opinion of ,
the war, Â°r hia reflation to carry it on, Â«
at ail shaken from any degree of those in- ,
separable evils, he thought it not fair to
avail hirafelf of tlie contrary arguing,
when; from accidental citcumftances it
told in his favour.
He obje&ed to printing rhe extra&s of
the Gazettes, because it would, prima fa
cie, indicate a ground of suspicion as p re .
paratory to a general inquiry into the cir
cumflances of the whcrfe campaign) and
this, he contended, would lead -the Hcmf
to an extent and detail of inquiry, of which
they could not be apprized, and as nofitf.
picion whatever in fad existed, he would
not consent to a measure which implied
that it did.
Whatever opinion the hon. Gentleman
had adopted concerning the British troops
he himfelf had no hesitation to declare
that with the single exception of the
of Dunkirk, they had <b6en as fucceijful
as they had been brave in every conftift
in which they had been engaged. Guns
colours, and stores, he said, would be a>
bad materials for the declamation which
was apprehended as for argument. The
merits of the campaign wpuld not bt de
fended on the ground that we had taken
or loft, more or less of these articles. The
campaign proved fuccefsful from the im
proved fituatron in which we flood at its
conclusion, compared to that in which we
were at the commencement of it.
Drat some (mall inaccuracy might in
some instance have occurred in the returns
contained in the Gazettes was very pofli
ble, particularly in in,lances of speedy re,
treat; in which cafe it was well know<i,he
fuppofed,that the officer commanding may
be less able to ascertain immediately the
articles left behind ; but this he thought
too trivial to conftitjjte a ground of minute
or serious charge, which never fk.uld be
instituted, but in enfes of great importance,
and founded on ft long ground of suspicion.
He conceived it no part of the duty of
a member to give in his individual capa
city, any information which the House
did not think proper to require, and there.
fore that hon. gentleman had no right to
ltx>k even for private explanation from any
person who may from his official Itation
(as Sir James Murray) have it in his pow
er to give. Forthefc reatons he thought
nothing could be more unnecefiary than
the prcfent motion, which he therefore
should refrlt.
Major Mail land j-ofe to explain, and
difclaimeil all intention of imputing any
j tnrog^rrireJpeFtfnnto - tJSTiriufh iroopj, j
as far as they were personally engaged in
the execution of plans, however unwise
these plans might be in theit.felves and un
fueceisful in the event.
Mr. Pitt observed, thiit in that view of
the xubjedl the motion became more un
necefiary, as his crimination would therv
only apply to the cabinet, in which the
plans were adopted, and yet the motion
pointed at a detailed examination of th*
execution.
Mr. Fox said, that if the doctrine ad
vanced by Mr- Pitt prevailed, the House,
though avowedly misinformed, were nci
thertt? lln** that misinformation corre&ed
~by private or official "t>mmuruotion.
The prcfent motion, he
thought expedient, and regarded it as 3
preliminary to a very neceflary inquiry
into the losses and di(honor of the cani
paign.
He took for granted, that Mr. Pilt,
agreeable to the opinion advanced this
night, was highly displeased with the At
torney-General, for giving the private un
alked information relating to Lord Shel
burne's letters. The loss i>f \vaÂ» PÂ°
objection to a war, he represented as a
very lofty argument, and one to which
he could not accede. Ever* with refpeft
to the continuanee of the war, the lofs
of men was a fad highly ufcfui to be
known, as.if the obje6V gained was inad
equate to that luff, it would fugged rea
sons to alter the plans of operation. As
there appeared tio danger of improper
disclosure to the enemy, and the informa
tion was such ss the country at large as
well a* the House should receive, he ex
pressed much furpiizc that any oppufitioiv
was made.
Sir James Murray informed the House,-
that the account of the loss of guns be
fore Dunkirk, which was inserted' in the
Gazette, was the best account which at
that time could be colle&td. In fact,
however, on more mature inquiry, tf<?
numbfr was found something under ra
ted, but not in a degree that would make
aay mete-vial imprt-ffion on the publie
mind. This inaccuracy arose from the
expeditious execution of the retreflt im
mediately after it was determined on.â
At that period eaÂ«h oiScer of artillery re-/
,mawJ ad naay gens as wa in his pow
er, though when the difpatcbes were
made op, all the returns of cannon
brought away had not been received, ami
therefore he was obliged to take a loole
e&mate of the commanding officer of
the artillery of what had been left be
hind, namely, 32, when in fact it after
wards appeared that 40 was the real num
ber.
Mr, Grey observed, that there wai no
imputation at all again!! Sir J. Murray,
but that nothing had been Hated which
took away the propriety of carre&ing
publicly an erroneous return which had
publicly been made. It was the firil I
time, he said, that Similar accounts had
been refilled. In former wars communi
cations of this kind were much more free
end abundant. He declared that he had
jio ways altered his opinion concerning
the motions he made for printing the
returns already obtained, and extracts
from the Gazettes. On those subjects,
and on the present, he thought th: fub
je(fl had a right to expeÂ£t full and expli
cit information.
Major Maitland said a few words in re
ply, and expressed much fatisfaftion, that
Sir J. Murray had not adopted Mr. Pitt's
hint of {ilence. Should the motion be
negatived, the country, he /aid, was then
tounderftand.thatno.reliance could be pla
ced on any source of intelligence how au
thentic soever it might profefs to be.
The motion was then Dut and nega
tived.
I'HE ISLAND OF MARTINIQUE,
According to the best information receiv
ed ycfleruny in town, surrendered to the
British Troops without much reliftance. Thit
agreeable intelligence was indubitably con
firmed by the arrival of the Qneen Charlotte
Packet, at Falmouth, from the Leeward Is
lands, after a pallaire of thirty days.
The Queen Charlotte has dispatches da
ted the -ioth of February, about ten days
later than what we yesterday communicated
to the public.
April 4.
Lady Wallace has long since informed us,
on the authority of Dumourier, that the
King of Prullia never entered with sincerity
into the league agaiplt France, but solely
with a view of ruining the House of Auflria,
which, if efferted, would plaee him at the
head of the German Empire. The public
not seem to have plarwl much'.reliance
1 jn her Ladyfiiip's aflertion. But the event
is likely to prove that her information was
authentic.
The late King of Prufiia, after he had
conquered Silesia, secured it to himfelf by a
treaty with Maria Theresa, Queen of Hun
gary, and left his ally Louis XV. to prosecute
the war as he thought proper. Â« I have be
gun (laid he) a course of physic fqr mvfelf",
and I advile my quondam friends co do the

Whether the present King intends to diet
himfelf, after so much loss "of blood, we do
fortunately the solid and fubiftantlal motives
of confoiation, which relieved Frederic 11.
on his sick bed.

that .1 Grandee of the Court of Tfmahel

with both hands whether his head was lliTl

' Wliert we calculate the average number
of the persons now imprisoned, eithf on
fufpicicn or for criminal attempts, in the
Department of Paris alone, we may fa rly
estimate that number at 12,000. If-the other
Departments have their proportion, there
Ihould be in France about 800,000 prisoners,
whose property has been confifcated by the

J but after the king's flight to Varennes, it
I was then no longer prudence to remain in

paper tended much to aggravate the ha

harangued the people who had airembled
round the prison, and declared that he
would forfeit his head if Hebert was not
the founded republican in Paris: he was
soon after liberated, and was led to the
people, who in these cases are sometimes

The Public are cautioned to
beware of counterfeited Five Dollar Bills oj
the Bank of the United States, W Twenty
Dollar Bills of the Bank of North America,
[even J of Wuicb have appeared in circulation
within a fw> days pajl ; tbej are a good ge
neral imitation of the genui>*Btils, but may
be diftwgnijbed by the following
M A R K S.
Five Dollar Bills of the Bank of tlx
United States.
ALL that have appeared havs the letter F.
for tneir Alphabetical Mark.
i The Texture of the Paper is thicker and
whiter and it takes the ink mare freely than
tlie genuine paper.
The O. in the word Company is rmal.er
than the M- and other letters of that word,
f,> that a iine extended from the tnp Â»t 'he <>,
to touch the top of the M. would txtend con
fiderabty above the range of the whole word.
In tilt- wo,d United the letters are narrow
erand cloier together than thtf reft ol the bill
The/and fin the word promise are nor
parallel, the/inclining much more forward
than the i.
The engraving is badly cxecuted,the fttokcs
of all the Lettets are Wronger and the devi e
in theniargin istnuch coarfcr and
appears da, kerihan in the Hue bills. Some
ol the counterfeits bear date in 17^1âWhere
as tho Bank was not in operation till Decern
ber, and no five dollar bills were issued in
that year. â¢
Twenty Dollar Bills of the Bank of Aorth
America.
ALL that have appealed have the letter
B for their alphabetical mark.
Tliey are printed on a paper nearly similar
to that of the counterfeit Five Dollar Note-,
above described; the engraving is bcttei ext
uctetl, ond they approach neater to tjjf ap
pearance of the genuine bills.
The fine ruled lines through the word â¢' :Â»<Â«-
Vv, in the body of-tbe bill, are in number th. r
teen in the genuine b.lls, and but twelve in
the counterfeits.
The word Company is much like the fame
word in the Five Do liar Bills &s defer ibed a
bove, the Â» being lels than them, and others
foil* wing.
There is no stroke to the t in the word North
whereas in the genuine bills the stroke is well
defined.
The letters ent in the word Twenty, to the
left hand at the bottom, do not come down to
the line, but are lb cut as to give an irregular
appearance to the word, the Tw and they go
ing below them.
The fiviMiurtr J Nixon, has the appear
ance of being written with lamb-black ami
oi], and differs from other inks used in
printing the bills and the calhier's tfgnature.
It is (uppoled thele forgeries were committed
in iomeof the Southern States,-as all the coun
terfeits that hav<* appeared, have come from
thence, and two porfoos have been apprehend
ed trrVirginraj ol auihoi
of them.
The 1 e ward of ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS
will be paid to any Peifonoi Pnlons wtiu tha.i
discover and prosecute to convi&iontbe teveial
offenders of the following del<*i iptions or any
of them, viz.
The person or pcrfons, who jnanuf<:Â£tured ;
the paper on which the aie printed.
The person or perlons, who engraved the
plates.
The printer or printers, o{ the bills.
Kvefy peifon wno Has aÂ£led as a pr.ncipal in
any other way, in the counterfeiting and utter
ing the Taid bills.

April 22, 1794,
Other counterfeit bills
of the Bank of the United States have appeared
in circulation.
The denomination is of TWENTY DOI,
the alphabetical mark is the let
ter B.
They may be diflinguifhed from the genu
ine by tke following MARKS :
The paper of the counteifeits is of a move
tender texture and glofley furface than th?
genuine, and there is no water mark inthen\.
The letter C. in the word CatWier, in the
true bills is strongly marked, whereas in the
counterfeits, the whole letter is a finc hair
stroke, evidently in an nnfiniflicd state. The
letters in tlie word demand, is badly formed
and the whole word ill done, and the're is no
1 comma at the end of it, as there is in the
' genuine bills.
r The marginal device, is much datker in
> the falfe, than in the genuine bi)ls owing to
" the shade strokes being coan'er, much nearer
together, and consequently much more nu
* merous. This difference strikes the eye at firft
view. â  ' :
The fame reward of ONE THOUSAND
DOLLARS, will be paid for apprehending, &
, profecuri'tig to oonvi&lon the several above
t described Offenders in to this, as to
the iaft described bills- *
