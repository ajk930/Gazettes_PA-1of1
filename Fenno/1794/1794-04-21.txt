JOHN VAUGHAN,
[Whole No. 569.]
For the Gazette of the United Status.
Mr. Fenno,
You are requested to fublilh the following
in your paper.
A HINT.
Certain young Students of Law with their
aflociates, who have of late frequented a
neighbourhood in this city, and been guilty
of condudt which reflects credit neither on
themselves nor their (Connections, are cau
tioned to beware of a repetition of such con
dudl ; for independent of the chailifement
which will be the consequence, they may ex
pedl to fee their names publiihed in the ncwf
papers.
TO THE OBSERVER.
I HAVE read with much fatisfa&ion,
your occasional remarks, on the merits and
demerits of the Theatric Corpsâto the
former, you have rendered juiticeâthe lat
ter you have treated with tenderaefsâfair
ly avowing no partiality, to influence the
public mind. A man who thus steps for
ward, with principles so independent, is
secure in his own conscience, of having,
with the best intentions done his duty, and
sure of the fuffrages of the public, who,
while they approve, will second his en
deavours. Upon thffe grounds, I con
tribute my mite, and only regret, that I
am unwillingly conftrgined to think, that
you, Mr. Obferver,have somewhat relaxed
in those duties, to the fulfilment of which,
you engaged yourfelf. lam however,
far from supposing, that you will not re
sume your pen, or that you have quitted
the service you volunteered in, before the
campaign is finifhed ; âPerfuaded, that
your jult criticisms mult rather flatter than
offend, and that every, -individual, under
the Banners of the Sock & Buflcin, feel
themlelves under obligations to the Ob
server, they have shewn their gratitude,
by amending that, which he has humbly
recommended.
Pursuing my obje<St thus farâl would
now wi(h to hint to you Mr. Obferrer,
whose prying eye, may not fee all things,
that you would notice, that want of de>-
meanor exhibited by fame, employed in
the concerns of the Theatre :âSurely the
ears of the audienceought not to be dinned
by the clattering of a Bamboo against the
fides of one of the Boxes, during the
performance of Miss Oldfield, in the cha
ra&er of Lady Frances Touchwood ?
It is arrogating in a servant of the public,
and offenfive to all who admire order and
decency :âSurely it is not come to this,
that we are incapable of judging of ex
cellences !ârwe can condemn, and we can
applaud, but premature applause, always
defeats the interested purpose it intends.
Miss Oldfield made her Debut at Annapo
lis, in the character of Defdcmona, and
was deservedly admired as a young Can
didate for public favor. Her firft appear
ance here, was last night, and allowing
for her natural timidity, great indulgence
was (hewn her, and often much applaud
ed. With a fine figure like hers, Ihe is
capable of great improvementâbut re
commend her to study a little more of the
" Suavitcr in Modo" giaceful a&ion, and
graceful attitudes, compose more than
half the difficulties of the stage.
I fay nothing of the other performers,
fatisfying myfelf, that in your next paper,
you will do them justice individually, and
remain Mr. Observer,

FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE.
LONDON, January 21.
It is known to Government, that tie
French have coined five hundred thovjfand
guineas, so exactly resembling the Engliih
guinea, that the counterfeit was not dj&o
vered at the mint till after two minute exa
minations. The defeA is in a simple letter
only. What the motives may be of our
enemies for taking this measure, cannot, per
haps, at this moment be explained; but that
it is sinister and ungenerous, cannot be
doubted.A private letter stats the loss of the Al
lies, on the borders of the Rhine! within the
last month, to amount to 35,090 men !âThe
lot ot the French, which cannot be so cor
recftlv ascertained, is rated at 40,000.

STOCKHOLM, Dec. p.
Our Capital, amidlt an externa! calm,
exhibit s U1 the symptoms of the mcft inter
na! fermentation and public distrust ; double
patroies traverse the (beets, the former or
ders again it going out in the night with
out lanthorns are renewed with great rig
our, and the inhabitants have been direct
ed, uni'.-r the most fev. re penalties, to (hut
themselves up in tbtir houses, the moment
government (hall tl.ink fit to give the fig
n<rt, by firing five guns from the Citadel,
and ringing the great alarm bell. Fortu
nately this has not been found neceflary,
the number of the conspirators being pro
bably much less than was at firft appre
hended.
It cannot, however, be diflembled, that
the spirit of civil discord has arisen to an
alarming height, and that even the citi
zens of divided into fac
tions, inspired with the most bitter animo
sity one against. another. This division
was lately manifeibd on the dismission of
Nordfn, from the office of Intendant of
the Police, and the appointment of Ull
holm by the Regent, to succeed him.
The of Nordin, gave him a
public dinner, as a marlt of their esteem,
upon which their opponents conferred the
fame honor on Uliholmâhappily they
â¢ confined themselves to good eating and
drinking, without attempting to disturb
one another, or the public peace.
Uilholm and one Bratt are said to have
difcoverea the firll traces of the conspira
cy, which was afterwards confirmed by
the opening of the Countess of Ruden
flciold's letter to General Baron d'Arm
felt in Italy. This lady, on the exami
nation, denied all knowledge of a conspi
racy; but afterwards, when informed
that government was in pofleflion of par
ticulars, in consequence of which Lieut.
Co!. Sandols was apprehended, (lie made
some confeflions respecting her own part
in it.
. She, however, and all the other persons
in custody, resolutely perliil in refuting to
give up their accomplices. D'Ehren
ftrom, formerly Secretary to the late
King, Is coniidered as one 6f the princi
pals of the conspiracy. Among his pa
pers, have been found proofs of the ut
most importance. The Commis, Seigu
eul, who is also apprehended, was to as
sassinate the "gent in one of those walks
which he often takes, either alone, or
with very few attendants. Mineur, va
let-de-chambre of Baron d' Armfeldt,
whose apprehension was highly intereftintr
is also taken.
On the firft rumour of the conspiracy be
ing discovered, he fled, as is supposed, to re,
pair to his master; but, although he had for
ty eight hours start of his purfuers,they came
up with him. A courier and an oflicer were
diipatched to Italy, with proper inftrucUons
for apprehending d'Armfeldt wherever they
should find him. It was known that he was
at Naples in November, but as his million
was only nominal, it is supposed that he has
since come nearer Sweden, to watch thepro
grefs of a plot which if it had succeeded,
would have put him at the head of the kine
dom. jjg 6
Such are the public rumours, which are to
be'received with caution; because, in all
civil diflentions, it is the practice of each
party to paint the other in the most odious
colours.

At the moment when we were actively

which cowardice and lafcality dug under

away the matches, which had not yet pro
duced their effect. I aided in person with

evil was not considerable. We shall soon

which I immediately sent a fufficient num

LONDON, January 23.
By a letter from BrufTtls, we find that
last week Joutdan's army received a rein
forcement of 28,000 troops of the line
from Vendeeâthat 12,000 moie with an
immense train of artillery, were to join
him in the coifrfe of the week, and that
he was evidently preparing for the attack
of Cobourg en majfe.

It is said that the Duke of Northumber

The arities on the frontier are daily re

but the plan of the attack is not yet io
clearly developed as to enable us to speak
with certainty 6t their operations.
The evacuation of Fort Louis is the
natural result of the former fucceflesrof the

of the combined armies <?f the Rhine.
By a letter frenn Dover, dated yesterday

of this fadt; it is communicated to us by
a person resident at Dover, but who is Hot

* Conjiilerations on the Loaii.
It is well known that the French are
preparing to attack the extensive line of
posts Â®i Coboung en majfe, as they lately
did those of Brunfwick and Wurmfer ; if
they wait until the greatest part of the
troops from La Vendee, joiajourdain by
regular marches ; the attack may begin
about the loth of February ; but if these
troops are conveyed by port, (as has fre
quently been done,) or if they do not
wait for them, the attack may begin ear
lier. It is Â£(id that this attack will be
made by the combined armies of Hoche
and jourdain, assisted by all the troops of
the firft requisition, within one hundred
miles of the frontier ; the attack will ex
tend from the Rhine along the Mozelle to
1 reves, and from thence along the Austri
an frontier to Nieuport, a distance of at
least 300 miles. Cobourg has not at this
time more effefiive men to defend this ve
ry extensive line, than Brunfwick and
Wurmfrr had in the beginning of Novem
ber, to defend a line of only thirty miles
111 length, whilst Cobourg will be attacked
by .orces three times as numerous as those
that defeated Buinfwick and Wurmfer
If the French fho'uld be foiled in this at

NEW-YORK, April 20.
From a Correfpondeni.
A gentleman just arrived from New
port, Rhode-Ifland-informs, tbat on Tues
day evening arrived there from Marti
nique,an Englilh tranfport,having on board
general the {count Rochambeau, with his
Suite, consisting of 8 officers. The trans
port was convoyed by the Vesuvius bomb
(hip, which left Newport the next morn
ing. By the Captaiu of the transport we
learn, that Fort Royal, Martinique, was
attacked and carried on the 2ill. and that
Fort Bourbon capitulated 0:1 the 23d of
March. In the Fort were 150 regular
troops, and about 800 mulattoes. It was
stipulated that the General and his Suite
should be sent to America, and the troops
to France.
The above Captain fays, that Fort Bour
bon iurrendered in consequence of the
English having discovered and destroyed
the pipes by which they received their wa
ter in the {jarrifon.
It was reported before the above vessels
failed that a French fleet and troops had
arrived somewhere in theWeft-Indies
and that the English were at present ill
manned, owing to their having garrisoned
the forts tVey had taken with the sailors.
By the vefTel arrived from Shelburne a
bout two days ago- we learn that the Fe
bruary mail from England was arrived at
Halifax : the letters brought by her may
be daily expetted.
The Comte de Rochambeau is expect
ed in this City on his way toPhiladelphia.
1 he Vesuvius (loop of war, we are told, is
returned to the Weft-Indies, end the Bri
tania transport which brought his Suite
from Martinico, is still at Newport Gen.
Grey's army is gone against the island of
Gaudaloupe.
Extract of a letter from an officer on board
the Ambuscade, dated Chefapeak Bay,
April 5, 2d year of the French Repub
lie, one and indiyifible.
" We have made twocruifes, but with
ittle fuccris, having taken only 3 prizes
2 of them English and tie other Spanish;
we expect with impatience the New-
York convoy,and have orders to hold our
selves in readiness to fail immediately on
their arrival.
â¢ "We have found many friends in the
brave Americans of NtwlYork. Those
9C Norfolk and Hampton, have llicwn us
an attention no less flattering. We can
not quit the American shore without foine
regret, but Ihall have the pleasing fatisfac
tion on our arrival in France, of inform
ing our countrymen of the friendly con
duct of the Americans towards us.
" The late Triumphs of Liberty, how
ever, will make our return doubly aggre
able.
" The Frigate La Concorde, and a
Corvette, remain on this station."
For the Gazette of the United States.
Mr. FennoÂ» â¢*
YOljR correspondent of Saturday, L. E.
in language of triumph and abuse, stigma
tises Democratic Societies, as conspirators
against equality, because they are defigued to
acquire influence. , ,
The disguise is too thin, to conceal a cloven
foot. The influence he opposes, is the influ
ence 6f reason, and the equality he contends
for, is an equality in ig orance.' The human
mind, in proportion as it excludes this species
of influence, is fitted to bear the frauds, as
the body is to bear the burthens, of those
privileged orders, who teach ignorance, and
who yet extort for their tuition, an extrava
gant compensation.
L. E, allows to a citizen, the occasional
equality of a solitary vote, but if three citi
zens assemble to confer upon public affairs,
he exclaims in all the rage of ariftocratical
PK.de â" You are a club of conspiratorsâ
mmd your own business"âShoemaker to jour
This doctrine proposes a crusade in favor
of a political papacy, for the extermination
of ail writings and opinions, violating the
jure divino pretensions of the powers that be.
It may be thus epitomised.
" Several citizens must not confer and
deliberate upon public affairs, left their de
liberations Ihould influence one citizen. With
out conferences public affairs cannot be un
derstood, and 'f fe-veral citizens cannot pub
lish their political opinions, without being
chargeable with the insolent intention of in
fluencing others, a portion, a fmgle citizen
cannot do it. It would evince a monarchical
delign in the one, as it is a proof of aristo
cracy in the many. All men have minds,
but all men are not equally informed; and
any attempt of those informed (the well
born or paper men always excepted) to in
ftruift the uninformed, is, an insolent claim
of luperiority." Therefore the right of think
ing, and the right of voting, are all the
rights which equally allows, in the opinion
of this ariftocratical champion. According
to him, the art of printing, and the law to
secure to authors their own works, are em
blems of slavery, becaul'e they imply, that
one human being may impudently attempt
to inform others.
Indeed Mr. Fenno, the reservoir of arifto
cntical deception is, almost exhaufted,for this
last potion, appears so evidently to be inter
mingled with the lees, that the good taste
of the people of America (tho'it is unjufily
insinuated that they are somewhat base and
ignorant) will at once perceive its poisonous
quality. A DEMOCRAT.
A letter trom Havre of the 24th Jan.
to a gentleman in this city, informs, that
the National Convention has decreed the
release of the American shippingâbut
whether they will be permitted to depart,
oaded, or not, the letter does not fay.
A paper of the I oth February, received
by Capt. Truxton, contains the British
Minister's budget and fpeechâfrom which
it appears that the war against France is
to be prosecuted with all the resources of
Great Britain. The Minister fays they
fight pro aris et focis âfor their Altars
and Fire Sides.
From several refpedtable quarters we are
informed that the dispatches from the Ame
rican Minister at the Court of London just
received, do not as has been publi&ed, (hew
that the British adminiltration are unfavor
ably inclined to the United States.
The Minister plenipotentiary of the
French Republic, has not received any
official account of the recapture of Va
lenciennes. A report of that event was
brought by the veflel arrived at Norfolk,
from Rochfortâthe printed accounts from
Fiance, by this veflel, are to the I ith of
February, at which time, General Jour
dan was preparing to make an aflault on
Prince Saxe Cobourg, with an army of
150,000 me .

The Firfl Arrterican Edition.
THE grand principle of Equality, if right
ly understood, is the only basis 011 which
universal justice, lacred order, and perfect
freedom, can be firijily built, and permanent
ly secured. The view of it exhibited in th;s
essay, at the fame time that it reprefles tlie
insolence of office, the tvrSnny of pi ide, and
the outrages of oppression ; confirms, 'n the
moll forcible manner, the necessity of'fnbor
dinatiOn, and the just demands of law ful an
thority. So far indeed, from loosening the
bands of society, that it maintains inviolate,
every natural and every civil diftin&ion,
draws more closely every tocial tie, unites in
one harmonious and jufily proportioned sys
tem, and brings men together on the even
ground of the inherent rights of human na
ture, of reciprocal obligation, and of a com
mon relation to the community.
