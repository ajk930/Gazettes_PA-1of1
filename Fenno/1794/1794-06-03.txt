For the Gazette of tht United States.
Mr. Fenno,
There is a propensity in our nature that
I inclines every man, even the molt profli
gate, to wish his neighbor to think
ast as he does himfelf; and it would be a
great happiness for mankind if those who
maintain the bell doctrines or tenets, were
the moll industrious in endeavoring to pro
pagate them. The contrary however is
too often the cafe.
To apply these truths tp the present
politics of the United States; we find at
the molt critical juncture of our public
affairs, when felf preservation calls aloud
foi temper, union, and the whole force
and power of the nation, a number of de
ligning men who are the grand movers of"
a certain party, and some of them receiv
ing either a salary or daily pay from the Na
tional or State Treasuries, empkiying a
large portion of their time in wriHng pam
phlets, addrefies for focietios, letters and
pieces for the papers, all calculated to
mislead the public mind, subvert the ne
ceflary measures of government; and if
polhble, deftroythe confidence of the peo
ple, even in a Wajhington.
The objedt these men have in view is
to bring about a revolution of men or mea .
Jurei, or bothâgetthemfelves and friends
completely into power, and polTefs the
reigns ot government. It matters not to
them which they accomplish firil, because
they believe their ends would be answered
in ether cafe. This being the leading con .
hderat.on in all their politics, etery circum
stance that occurs in the course of events
is attempted in some way or other to be
made subservient to that end ; and it is
sincerely believed they would freely involve
this happy country in all the calamities of
war, or even put the very exillence of the
conlhtution and government to the utmost
hazard, rather than fail in their defies
and ni hopes t>f by a scheme I
of anarchy and coufuUon. â¢ in-'
Thole very, men or their predeceilors
have been conilantly employed in endea
voting to Itir up a spirit of discontent and
uneafiiiefs, but the wisdom an.d prudence
of the government aided by the wbergoed
sense of the people, has in a great mealure
baffled their designs ; and had it not been
for the wait between France and England
and its consequent evils, they would long
since have been at a loss for fubje&s of a
nimadversion or materials to. with.
It waS found ifcat an oppofitwn to the
coiillitutipn would be np longer lillened to,
that the fiibjedls of the bank, funding ly*-
tem, and exciffc were become raihei ilale,
at least that they would not Jo hngly tr
alone to inflame the pailions; hence Frcr.ch
politics were laid hold of \yith cabernets
by all hands, and a bold attempt madt,
under, as I may fay, the administration
of Mr. Genet in the course of kit summer,
to drag us immediately into a war wit'u
England, either by an aggreflion on the
part of bur'citizens, or to provoke one
from her; contrary to the sense of the
President and every sober man in the Uni
on, and wlien there was neither any jufl
cause or obligation whatever . exiting.
How far their proceedings may have in
fluehced the late conduct of the British
court, it is impossible to fay, but we know
certainly that their politics have been in
jurious to this country.
Unfortunately the Bty'tiTh are foolifh
and wicked enough to do the very thing
these people wish, and they are only un.
easy at present, leuit the business of war
(hfluld be impeded by negotiation or a re
turning good difjiofition on the part of
Britain. These are the patriots who op
pose their politics to, and endeavor to per
suade u3 to distrust the man that fconduft
ed us with fafety through the tempeits of a
revolution and l'even years war ; when fume
of the champions and of the pre
fect day were either indulging in youthful
pleasures, or paying homage to a British
governor, and v.'ho in cafe of real danger
would probably be found only in a place
of fafety.
A prejudice with regard to ancient
forms of government, heightened by the
aTpfflTÃr 'altgfijl - â 
tions, has led some of. us to think too
lightly of the real ules of religion and gc- â
vcrnment to society. Like men in a (late
of intoxication, we are displeased with
those who retain and cxercife 'kfi' reason,
and call them by the rf
peciuity if the% are public officers. This (late
of the public mind, the artful antfdffign. ,
ing politician takes advantage of to pro
mote his views of ambition and revenge ;
and it may be relied upon as a fadl, that
disturbing the peace of a nation, or the
deftrudtion of a government, are but small
obflacles in the way of such partisans:
therefore the people will make their elec
tion.
It seems to be the wish of the party to
engage in a war with the combined pow
ers without any kind of prepaiation to
carry it on, and to take chance for railing
ways and means afterwards bv laws to be
adapted to the occasion and circuniftan- ;
ces, according to modern usage.

A DEMOCRAT.
2d June, I 794.
To the Editor of the General Advertiser,
Sir,
our paper of this morning, deserves
honorable mentionâand by all true Demo
cratic Societies (hall have it. Your Cor
respondents have hitherto been actuated
by a little too much timidity in their at
tacks upon the President, and have rather
attributed his bad conduct too evil coun
sellors ; but this morning, the attack is
bravely, and without disguise, aimed at
the President; and, in addition to this,
it is infinitely well-timed, they know the
iubjedt of a bill, defining certain crimes
andpuni/hments, was to come before Con
giefs this day. I like to fee such virtu
ous exertions so popped in upon the fac
tion ; it will confound them and help our
iide, in Congress, to arguments.
Another happy mode they have adopted, .
that js, denominating the majority of Con.
grefs Â« fiiflion, now that dcferves more
honorable n,ci;;.on than any thing they
have done before, no rr.aitti how nume
rous they are, so long as they difagrec
with our Societyâ, them *..faflion
If- all Congrcf; uniteâcall them a fac
tion. It our precious ones in
Congress are few; but is not a gteat fac
tion Worfc than a little one, or a nufae
rous faction worll of all ? I once thought
our Editor had become temifs, and had
forgotten 0411 declining causeâbut this
morning, he lias" not only atoned for pafl;
neglcft, but laid up in [lore a rich fund
of lupcrerogation. I Ihall move a resolve
in his favor, the next meeting of our so
ciety, What, fuffci' CojigreJs and the
Prehdent to go on con flit u'ionally, to
make laws, whether we like thein or not >
No, no, gird up your loins, and do not
let us fail,, as the patriotic Captains and
1 Mates did, vVho unitedly agreed one even
â ng not to go to lea, and feparats'.y die
next day, actually went.

The REMEMBRANCERâiVo. I.
Of late it has become fafhionable, in
certain companies, to throw out the giof
felt abide agaiiil'c Cotigtefs, and to consider
that body as having fubmiited but too
patiently to very flagrant injuflfcs.
In trying this charge we ihall take it
for granted, that Great Britain has en
couraged and aided the forages to destroy
our frontier inhabitants ; set the Al
gerines upon 11s ; and ipade Algeiines of
her own ittbjefts in tfie Weft Indies, to
annoy, uul; il poilible, aiiiiiliilate our
ttadc : And, further, that her'ministry
have only waited for. a good pretext, that
might Unite her own people againli this
country,. to' commence open and actual
war. W will allo iuppofe, that the de
predations commuted by Great Britain,
on our trad and territory, would jullify
the United States 111 recurring to arms.
The United States being thus threat
ened with wat by Great Britain, we as
sert that it was a duty of CohgrtiJ to en
ter upon preparations to meet it.
What, :n this ''- nation of things, have
n ... diiicu' Have they heinuuatri- ,
maus to pr..mSfc'ac.-.janâ¢ .. ; r*ssfS3fot
has there beeu a uniform, fvftematic, and
; powerful opppfition in that body agamit
warlike preparations ?
Tt is well known that there ci'ft twj
parties in Congress ; it is nefeflary, there
fore, to a proper fohition of the! ques
tions, to be well informed of the con
dun i>f each party refpeft.velv, in orilfir
that, if blame has beert incurred by ei
ther, we may know to which it belongs.
We have taken it for granted, that the
cu rid Lift of Great Britain has been, for a
long trme pa It, so hostile to the CJnited
States, as to inalx preparations for war
indifpenfibfc.
One party proposed to threaten an<}
frighten with a tianfer of our
trade to France, a fequeiiiation of the
debts owing bv our citizens to her mer
chants and manufacturers, a llon-impor
, tation adt, and with ftaiving her Weil In
dia Islands by embargo; which meafares
were to compel Grewr Britain to drt the
United States justice, and d op her hos
tile intentions tewards them ; after which
trade wa/ to return in its old chann l.
The other party opposed these plans
as c.rfuaiuiiig no principle of refillance,
in cafe of war; as bein j equally injuri
ous in their operation to the trade and in
terests of the United States as to Great
Britain ; and as aiFoftiing the Britifli
court what it was said they wanted â
matter to render war with the United
States popular, or a pretext for commen
cing actual holfilities. They called up
on the party for threattnfng andfright
ening, (if they believed what they atTert
ed refpefting the designs of Great Bri
tain ) to join with them in placing the 11-
nite.l States in a situation to meet war by
defenfive preparations. They proposed,
therefore, to equip a finall fleet, fortify
our harbors, raise a provisional anny, and,
in the mean time, try the cifeit of nego
tiation.
The party for threatening and fright
ening England, opposed the equipment
of snips, fortifying uu." harbors, and a
provisional army.
After a long struggle, the party for
negoeiatioii and defenfive nuafures pre
vailed. Jliftiee is to be demanded irnm
Great Biitain. and reilitutioa or war be-. >Haw have the two barties a&ed Cuce
putting the matter on tnis ifluc â 
As ptepa rations for wai cannot, be
made without wney,. tl.c paity for nego
ciatiotf- and defenfive meal'urcs, proposed
a number of taxes upon luxuries, which
would have Veen paid chiefly by the rich,
and a tax upon fait, which would have
fallen equally upon every Older of citi-
Zcns * * .
. The party for threatning opposed molt
of these taxes, and iwfccd seemed willing
to agree to almolt none. According to
them, cocichfcs tind chariots ought not to
be taxed, which are, used chiefly by the
rit h ; nor loat-fugar, which is,chiefly con
fiiined by the wealthy, or tiiofe in good
circumftanct'Sjwho aic best.able to pay tax
es. I" (hort, as if to cast a ridicule up
on tht whole business, they propofdd a
land-tax, for which about thirteen vyted }

lear;i that any voted j and, to crown the"
whole, an" additional duty upon importAl
goods, when evci y oue knows, that the
reason for having recpuife tQ internal ob
jects of taxation, is because, dining war,
little revenue can be expected from impor-
Â»
tations-
Suth has been nearly the conduct of
the two parties in while a for
midable power has been thiehtCuing the
UmtedStates with all the horrors of war.
The one struggling for mil tary prepirati.
011s to ward cm or meet that event: the
other llruggliug to prevent them : The
one, to nle a borrowed language, holding
out to England the Olive-Branch and
the fwotd ; the other, a nettle aud an
empty scabbard.
To which party {hall we coniigfi the
palm of wisdom, forelight and magnani
mity ; ;o the gentlemen of the olive
branch and sword, <il thoi'e of the nettle
and empty fcabbaid?
Without undertaking to dccide, or as
sign motives to either party, other than a
love of country and the public good, it
may be permitted to mention-, with np
plaufe, those representatives fiom this
state, as well as from other ilates, who,
though sometimes feurid with one fide,
and fometiines with the other, Were al

Mrs. Alar shall, whose superior powers
are ever exerted to please, has from the com
mer.cement of her appearance in the New
Theatre, been received with uninterrupted
applause. The anticipated gratification of
feeing her in two inch contralled chara&ers
as thoie of Juliet and the Romp, will un
doubtedly attraa a croudcd house, and leave
her no cause to regret her exertions to obtain
American patronage.

OBSERVER No. 3Gt
Mr. Fenno-,
The people who attended the Theatre
last evening, were highly gratified, by the
jjerforrnance, especially by that of Mra.
Warrell, whose benefit it was. This ac
tress, always perfed, in her part, clialle
and propei in action, has experienced the
approbation of the public, in a full house;
a circumstance which must give pleaflire
to every benevolent mi'iiL
Mr. Whitlock in the character of Sir
John Flowerdale in I.ioncl and Clarifia,
defeives particular notice; he has always
filled his part, with much propriety ; but
was truly great in it last evening. Upon
the discovering his daughter's affections
for Lionel, he exceeded all expectation.
In the muiical parts, Mrs. Warrell and
Mrs. Oldmixon, were fuccefsrul, in au
fwering.if not exceeding,tjtie high expecta
tions which were formed, from a know
ledge of their muiical talents.
The Observer, feels a juftification, for
a short address to a generous public, in
favor of Mrs. Marshall.
An aCtress, who has made so manv ex
ertions to please, and who has so well
succeeded, will not, perhaps, be in want
of any afiiftance, from the feeble efforts
of the ObserverâBut (hould he fail of
success, his attempt is derived from bene
volence :
The parts of Juliet, and the Romp,
alfigncd to this actress for Wednelday
evening, are such, as the public may pio
mife themselves, from her talents, a high
entertainmentâand when they know that
Mrs. Marlhall'e benefit, will much depend
on their attendance in the firft instance,
as well as their approbation in the second:
The Observer cannot but anticipate a full
house, and is confident the audience will
| be richly entertained. '
No aftrefs has ever clone more, to obtain
die approbation of the friends of the Dra
ma, than Mis. Marshall; and it would
be painful, if ftie should be neglected, at
her benefit.

From a late Engl]Jh paper.
Tlie anxiety "of the public on the late
rumours, with refpeA to the king of Prus
sia and the Emperor, has naturally given
rife to a variety of ftorits j the truth or
faitliood of which it is not easy to afcer
taiu. It is said, however, and with pro
bability, as the cause of the; journey both
of the arch-duke to Vienna, and of lord
Elgin to England ; that the Pruflian mi
"ilter at BrulTels had presented an official
note to prince Charles, of so intereiling a
kind as to induce his highness to repair to
the head-quarter 3 to hold a consultation
with the prince of Cobourg and the other
chiefs, at which the Imperial and British
minilters assisted. The result of this coun
cil, hsld at Arth, the arch-duke thought
proper himfelf to var to Vienna, and
lord Elgin to England. The fubilance
of the communV ation is said to be an of
fer made to Piuffia by the French, so
wife, moderate, and political, as to in
duce him to entertain it cordially, and to
submit it seriously to the other combined
powers.
The King of Prussia cannot be purchased
for a million, and if he is to go to the highest
bidder, there cin be little doubt as to the re
s Lit.âThe Frtudi Republic has, at this mo
ment, by the lowest computation, not less
than 40 millions sterling in its Exchequer.
The committee of Public Safety polTefiing
so large a stock, with so precarious an inter
est in it, will not be eaiily out-bidden, what
ever be the competition!
ANECDOTE.
One day the Arcbbilhop of Canterbury
said to Betterton, the player, " Pray inform
me, Mr. Betterton, what is the reason you
adtors, ou the flage, can afFeit your audieii
â¢ ces, with fpcaking of tilings imagi ary, as
if they uere real; while we, in the church,
i'peak of ihings real, which our congregations
receive, as if they were only imaginary ?"
" Why, my Lord, replied Betterton, the
reason is plan: We aiflors, on the llage,
speak of tilings imaginury, as if they were
real; and you, in the pulpit, speak of things
real, as if they wefv onty imaginary."

The Public are cautioned to
Wware of counterfeited Five Dollar Bills oj ,
>he Sank of the United States,, and Twenty i
Dollar Bills of the Bank of North America, J
Qveral of which Lave appeared in circulation .
within a few dnys past ; they are " good ge
neral imitation of the genuine Bills, but may
be di/lingui/hed by the following .
marks.
five Dollar Bills of the Bank of tlx
United. States.
ALL that have appeared have the lettef F.
for tljeir Alphabetical Mark.
The Texture of the fa per is thicker and
whiter and it takes the ink more freely than
the genuine paper.
The O. in the word Company is smaller
than theM. and other letters of that word,
so that a line extended from ihe top of the O,
to touch the top of the M. would extend con
siderably above the range of the whole word.
In the word United the letters are narrow
erand closer together than the reft of the bill
The i and Jin the word promise are not
parallel, the J 'inclining much more forward
than the i.
The engraving is badly executed,tfie fti okes
of all the Letters are stronger and the device
in the margin particularly is much coarser and
appears darker than in the Hue bills. Some
ot the counterfeits bear date in 1791âWhere
as the Bank was not in operation till Decern
ber, and no five dollar bills were issued in
jhat year.
Twenty Dollar Bills of the Bank of North
AmericaÂ«
ALL that have appeared have the letter
B. for their alphabetical mark.
They are printed on a paper nearly similar
to that of the couuterfeit Five Dollar *Notes
above described; the engraving is bettei exe
ucted, and they approach nearer to the ap
pearance of the genuine bills.
The fine ruled lines through the word Twen
ty, in the kfody of the bill, are in number thr*
teen in the genuine b.lls, and but twelve in
the counterfeits.
The word Company is much like tie fame
word in the Five Dollar Bills as defer ibed a
bove, the 0 being less than the w, and others
following.
There is no stroke to the t in the word North
whereas in the genuine bills the stroke is well
defined. '
The letters ent in the word Twenty, to the
left hand at the bottom, do not come down to
the line, but are so cut as to give an irregular
appearance to the word, the Tw and shejr go
ing below them-
The signature J. Nixon, has the appear
ance of being written with lamb-black and
oil, and differs from other inks used in
priming the bills and the cashier's iigndture.
It is fuppoied ihefe forgeries were committed
in (ome of the Southern btates, as all the coun
terfeits fctayr apj* eaj _ have_ come troifi
thence, and two persons have been apprehend
ed m Virginia, on suspicion of being the author
of them.
The reward of ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS
will.be paid toany Person or Peifon's who fhail
discover and profecutc to convi&ion the feveial
offenders of the following or any
of them, viz.
The person err pci/ops, who raanufa&urcd
the paper on which the Bills aie printed.
The person or persons, who engraved the
plates.
The printer or printers, of the bills.
Every person who has acted as a principal in
any other way, in the counterfeiting and utter
ing the said bills.
Philadelphia, March 28, 1794
April 22, 1794,
Other counterfeit bills
ot tile Bank of the United States have appeared
in circulation.
The denomination is of TWENTY DOL
LARS,and the alphabetical mark is the let
ter B.
They may be diflinguifhed from the genu
ine by the following MARKS :
The paper ot the counterfeits is of a more
tend-r texture and gJofley furface than the
genuine, ami there is 110 water mark in them.
The letter C. in the word Cashier, in the
true bills is strongly marked, whereas in the
counterfeits, the whole letter is a fine hair
stroke, evidently in an unfinifhed state. The
letter a in the word demand, is badly formed
and the who.'e word ill done, and there is no
comma at the end of it, as there is in the
genuine bills.
i le Marginal device, is much daiker in
u t ' la " " le genuine bills owing to
the (hade strokes being coarser, much nearer
together, and consequently much more nu
merous. This difference ftrifces the eye at firft
view.
The fame reward of ONE THOUSAND
DOLLARS, will be paid for apprehending, &
prosecuting to convi&ion the several above
delcribed Offenders in refpeifl to this, as to
the last defcVibed bills.

HPHEgrancl principle of Equality, if right-

universal justice, sacred Order, and perf'e&
freedom, can be firmly built, and permanent
ly fe cu red. The v7ex* 7SF \f vxtirbiled m Tl\u

infojence of office, the tyranny of p:idej ard
the outrages of opgrefiion ; confirms, it) the
most forcible manner, the neceflity of subor
dination, and the jult demands of lawful au
thority. So far indeed, from loofeuing the
bands of society, that it maintains inviolate,
every natural and every civil dftin&ion,
draws more closely every social tie, unite* in
one harmonious and justly proportioned lyf
tem, and brings men together On the even
ground of the inherent rights of human na
ture, of reciprocal obligation, and of a com
mon relation to the community.
