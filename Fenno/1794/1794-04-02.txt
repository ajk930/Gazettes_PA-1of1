Congress of the United States-
Howje of Reprejenidtivcs
March 10.
Mr. Giles's Speech Concluded,
All this machinery leflens the number
of the productive* and increases the num
ber of unproductive hands of the nation
in Great Britain. The operation "has
been extended so far, that the poor rates
alone, probably afforded a greater tax per
capita than the whole taxes paid fn the
United States. He was altonifhed with
these fatal examples before our eyes, that
there should be any gentlemen, who would
wish to enter into this falhionable system
of politics. He said the United States
had already progressed full far enough in
to this system.
For-executively of the ordinary expence
of the civil lift a debt had been funded
upon principles of duration. An army
had been raised at an immense expense,
and now there was a proportion for a na
vy. He obfjrved that for several years
pjft the appropriations for the support of
the military establishment, had exceeded
a million of dollars per annum, from o.ne
million to one million and a half annually.
He believed that if the expenca had been
foremen, there would have been more ac
tive efforts to have avoided it. It was a
policy at this day very generally condemn
ed : yet we are now to exhibit a counter
pait of this policy upon the ocean, with
this aggravation: that it will commence
with greater certain expence, and with a
more uncertain objeÂ£t. The system of
governing by debts he conceived the most
l-effned iyitem of tyranny. It seems to
have been a contrivance devised by politi
cians, to succeed the old system of feudal
tenures, both systems were tyrannical, but
â¢ the objects of their tyranny were different.
The system of feuds operated upon the
perfQti ot the individualâthe system of
debts operates upon the pockets of
the individual. In the feudal lyftem th*
tenant often received some indulgence and
lenity from the martial generosity which
generally characterized the Lord. The
Lord was gratified with the acknowledg
ment of the tehant, that he was a slave,
and the rendition of a pepper corn, as
an evidence of it ; the product of theten
ant'slabor,wasleftforhis awn support. The
fyftemof debtsaffords no such indtilgencies;
its true policy is to devise objudts of ex
pence, and to draw the great,Jl pofftllefum
frorp the people in the leqfi mode.â
It boalts not of ceconomifmg in calls upon
the people for contributions.âlt boasts
not of ceconomifmg in the objects of ex
penditure.âlt consults the obedience and
not the happiness of the people. There
is no device which facilitates the system of
expence and debts so much as a navy ; and
he declared from that conlideration, he
should value his liberty at a lower price
than he now did, if the policy of a per
manent naval establishment, should obtain
in the United States.
He saw another strong objection to the
establishment of a navy. He deemed it a
hoftageto its full value, for our good be
haviour, to the great naval powers, until
it should be able to contend with* them
for the ocean. It will encreafe rather
than lefTen our dependance upon them.
With refpeft to the other confidertitions,
their utility in affording an additional se
curity for the collection of the revenue, he
should make but one observation ; When
revenue is laid, the expence of the ma
chinery employed irt the collection, is the
primary consideration. These vessels may
therefore be considered as aquatic Jberiffs ;
but of the most expertfive order, they will
be an additional cost of at least 20 per cen
tum upon the whole revenue colk&ed ; the
expence incurred therefore will exceed the
security afforded, and of course ought not
to be incurred.
Upon the whole if these considerations
were not fufficient to induce the house to
negative the bill, he conceived the impres
sions produced upon his own mind by them,
would furnifh a juftffication for his opposi
tion. He said if thebillfhouldpafs,he should
however find a consolation in a consciousness
of his own fallibility, and a rdpeft for the
opinions of the majority who advocated it;
but imprefTedas he was with the fubjedt,
he felt it a duty, as far as he could,, to
give a veto to the measure.
"A CARD.
Mr. S. finding the ritizeh entkely mis-
taken in some of the ideas lie has taken
up in perufiug the last note- Mr. S. had
ttic honor to addref3 him, he is induced
o'ude more to eildeavtV ta set him right,
on the puiutin yiiich he thinks him at \a
rience with the flatetrent; the Adtive was
not carrying -p.ovifions to France when
taken into Falmouthâ{hewas loaden from
Philadelphia with sugar and coffee, war
ranted as was be'Syre ltated, to he Ameri
can property âihe has now however been
6 or 8 months lying in England, her char
ges and lots of time considerable, and her
final fate totally uncertainâdepending
perhaps on the doubtful conftrudion of
what the meaning may be of adjudication
in a British admiralty courtâThe Mercu
ry was as unwarrantably seized and carried
into Jamaica, and it was lucky for Mr. S.
she escaped before the adjudicatory decree
had found its way thitherâor perhaps
the valuable returns the citizen speaks of
had never been madeâhut as it is, there
was a long detention sustained, and many
expences incurred for which the brig was
acquitted, no compensation was made.â
With refpedt to the John, her cafe was
peculiarly hardâshe was cleared out with
a cargo of American wheat from Falmouth
to St. Maloes, befoie any war or ail of
parliament or proclamation of ,the British
king had rendered the doing so
yet she was flopped on putting into Guern
sey for a pilotâthe 'cargo was taken on
account of the British government at the
price the French were to pay for it, but
the cargo deliverable at the Island of Jer
sey ; on going thither a British sloop of
war appointed'to convoy the brig, sent a
boat on board of her and tot>k the com
mand from tire Captain and crew, and pro
ceeding on the voyage, stupidly rtin the
brig on the rocks, wherfe she was io com
pleatly wrecked, that it colt near 9001.
flerling to repair her, and near 8 months
detention, for all which.the British court
refufed to make any compensationâwith
what justice the citizen will judge.
I After all, it is but a sorry way of rec
| koning, to set off the wrongs we sustain
from one nation, in defiance of all law and
reason, by throwing into the scale tempo
rary inconveniences fuffered in the course
of an arduous revolution from anotherâ
yet the French depredations have been
few in number, and not that Mr. S. knows
of, sustained without suitable reparation
being made when demanded: whether this
can be said with juflice of Britain, a few
months will enable all of us fully to decide
âMr. S. has certainly not so far done with
them, but to have fmcerely the wish, that
they may speedily discoverâhow vain are
their projedts of starving or conquering
the French ; and consequently how much
more beneficial it would be even for them
selves, politically considered, tq fuffer our
commerce to proceed on without inter
ruption, since its riches at'laft, however
circuitoufly, center in the recompence of
their own artizans and induftrioiis rtianu
facturers.
For the Gazette of the United States.
Mr. Fenno,
Difeuffions on public men and meafuret
while conducted with decency and pursued
with candor, merit attention, as the pub
lic have a right to be vigilant arid inform
ed as to the condudfc of their servantsâbut
how far Mr. Fenno your cofrefpondent
Honeftus comes under this description, the
public will judge, since he has ventured in
disguised allusions to arraign the character
of one, who, though he is pleased to stile
him an orator lately sprung up among us
âhe hath probably better, or at least as
well founded claims of public ufefulnefs as
moil of his ageâln 1776, from the early
period of the life of the Orator, it was
certainly not in his power to take an ac
tive part in the field with his American
brethren, but his taking the oath of alle
giance to the government in 1777, was cer
tainly fufficiently indicative of his disposi
tion to prove serviceable when he could to
the cause of American independence and
freedom : In 1781, he was appointed re
ceiver of taxes for Pennsylvania, and trea
surer to the departmentof finance,in which
Actions of great importance at that day,
he was happy to have a power of lending
an aiding hand ia the trsnfadtions which
led to the peace of 1783. âEver since em
ployed in adtive and extensive scenes of
commerce, beneficial at once to the coun
try and himfelf, he has never concerned
himfelf with politics, further than to as
sist and support men and measures, he
thought calculated for public ufefulnefs on
the plan of 1776, & in this independent
, I
carccr," neither the renom of private malic
nor the rage of public factions flia
interrupt himâno, nor even the polit
iiifiÃiiations of good Mr. Honellus.

Note of thi Foreign Minijiers to M. Rernjlorff.
" The ministers of the powers at present
at war with France, at the Court of His Da
nilh majesty, having been made acquainted
with a paper, printed and addrefied to the
Danilh merchants, signed by Grouvelle, sty
ling himfelf minister plenipotentiary of the
foi d'tfant French Republic, have the honour
to transmit a copy of it to his excellency the
Count de Bernftorft', praying him to be pleat
ed to inform them, whether the paper is au
thentic and authorized, and if, in reality, the
said Grouvelle is authorized by his Danilh
majesty in that charafler, at this public ast
makes them presume,

" Having given an account to the King,
my milter, of the note transmitted to me ou
the xjth instant, by the ministers of the pow
ers at war with Prance,hi'3 majesty has or
dered me to anfiver, that lie had seen in l the
note, with pain, a proof of that diftruit for
which he was certain he had given no occa
sion ; that, if it was notorious that the Na
tional Convention had appointed Grouvelle
minister plenipotentiary in Denmark, it was
equally known, that he had neither been re
ceived nor acknowledged in Denmark in that
quality; and such an acknowledgment, which,
by its nature, is a public a<3, could net but
be generally known. His .majesty, always
faithful to his declarations, cannot and ought
not to be fufpe&ed of having any intention
of failing in them. I ought to make one re
markâno truth is more evident, nor more
universally acknowledged, than this, that no
body can be answerable for the actions of an
other ; and still more, when it relates to a
step unforefeen, unknown, and-with which it
\vas impofiible to have any toncirn.

" The Note of Count de Bernftorff, in
answer to that from the Ministers of the pow
ers actually at War with France at ike Court
of his Danilh Majesty, in fatisfying the En
voy extraordinary of' his Britannic Majesty,

calicned, about eighty years ago, their Note, ,

against which he prctefts for himfelf ( Â« hile
those with whom he had the honor to a<st
may make their reprrfentations on it either
verbally or in writing) with the fame emo
tion with which he felt how little it was me
rited. If it could have been believed for a
moment that feis Danilh Majesty could forget
his declarations, the novelty of the fa<st, thch
a* the uliirpation of an aftivc and public cha
ratfter, left unpunilhed by the Gowrnment,
was a very just and natural motivtffqr their
common Note. The under signed Minister
is ready to avow, that he had not Â«<juallv
Itrong for i'uppofmg, that it was possible for
the King of Denmark to receive, as Plenipo
tentiary to his august and sacred person, him
who undertook the office of reading to bis
unhappy and innocent Sovereign the sentence

A gentleman who left Dominique on

English had not opened their batteries on
Fort Bourbon, until the 4th instant, du
ring which time, there was a very confiant

The loss of a sloop, loaded with war

CHARLESTON, March 19.
MONDAY night a riot took plae at the
Theatre, which had nearly produced some
very serious conlequencts. Two or three
Frenchmen, belonging to the privateers or
their nation now in the harbor, having treat
ed some ladies in the boxes with much rude
ness and indecency, were very properly and
deicrvcdly turned out of the house. la cou
fequence of this measure, they went down
to tiie bay, where they reported that one of
their countrymen had been murdered. They
(hortly after returned with a considerable
number of sailors, headed by the Captain of
the Lafcarzas, and accompanied by a well
known refiient ox this city. They were all
armed with cutlafles and other offenlivS wea
pons. The evening's entertainment being
juit over at this time, they indiscriminately
attacked the persons who were coming out
of the Theatre, several of whom were . â¢ound- I
ed. Not content with thfcfe heroic feats, they
proceeded to demolilh some carriage*,, cutting
the traces, and wounding the horses. The
alarm bell being rung, a great many of the
inhabitants, who had retired to reft, left their
beds, and repaired to the lceue of action.
Parties from the several military corps were
out, and with some' difTicuity the no: was
quelled. Fourteen of the ringleaders were
fecared, and lodged in the guard-hotife, some
of them being much hart before they sub
mitted, and tfcrce others were paroled.
They remained under a strong guard.
Among the prisoners is the lieutenant of
the Lafcarzas, who iV laid to be wounded.
The captain was paroled, and a guard ap
pointed to escort him to his lodging to
prevent any injury being offered to his per
j son. ft*
The police will now give the inhabitants
an opportunity of jud-iag whether they <
are to expect protection to their persons
or whether they are to be irtfulted.abufed,
and their lives endangered \vith impunity.
It may be some consolation to reflect,
that the violent outrage above related, did
not originate with any of our fellow-citi
2ens. Au the fame time, hawser, it is
a mortifying confederation, ,that a want of
energy in the execution of our I.tws, or an
unjuftiliable partiality to any particular de
scription of peopre, "should fiibjeft. the
peaceable inhabitants of this city to the
insults of ruffians, who are permitted to
parade the llreets at pleasure, armed ajid
ready for mifchief.
Yesterday a Special Court of Wardens
was held in the City-Hall, for the trial of
the Rioters. There were fifteen- in all
