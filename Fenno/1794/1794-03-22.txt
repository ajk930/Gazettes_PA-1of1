A General Meeting of the
Citizens,
This afternoon.
The fubferibers having been appointed
by their fellow-citizens, to prepare and
report an Instrument expreflive of the pub
lic thanks, for the ferviccs which were
rendered by the Committee of Health,
during- the calamity that lately affli&ed the
City and neighborhood of Philadelphia ;
and to suggest the measures proper to be
pursued, in order to carry the recom
mendation of that benevolent Committee
into effect, deem it their duty again to
call the attention of the citizens to a fub
jeft so interesting to the community upon
principles of gratitude, honor and policy.
At the meetings which have been hi
therto summoned, there have not attend
ed a fufficient number of Citizens U> ex
press the public sentiment; owing, it is
prolumcd, to a general acquirfcence in
the plan which has been proposed and
published : But as the fubferibers cannot
think themselves warranted in proceeding
further, upon this important occaiion,
without the express approbation of their
Fellow-Citizensâthey request a General
Meeting to be held at the City-Hall, at
5 o'clock This jlflernoon.
It will be remembered, that unlefr the
citizens attend agreeably to the above
appointment, the molt meritorious servi
ces mult pass unacknowledged. A nume
rous class of Orphans will probably be in
volved in great distress, and even the ba
lance due to the Committee of Health
must remain unpaid.

the Mini Her of War, by the Galeial
in Chief of the Army of Italy.
From the Quarter-General of
Oilioule. tnc 29th Frimaire,
id Year of the Republic,
one and iiid:viable.
Citizen Minister,
Toulon is rendered to the Republic,
and tlie success of our arms is complete.
The promontory of Aiguillctte, iirlt de
cided the fate of the infamous city. The
26th Frimaire, every means were united
for the reduÂ£t!on of this polition. The
bad weather was contrary to our views till
near one in the morning : but nothing
could flop the ardor of men, free, com
batting againlt tyrants. âAnd notwith
flandinj the obstacles of the weather, our
brethren rulhed into the path of glory as
soon as the order was given. The repre
sentatives of the people, Robcrfpierre,
Sallicetti, Ricoud and Frenon were with
usâThey Ihewed to their brethren an ex
ample of their courage. This paternal and
heroic body was certain to ensure victory.
The English redoubt, defended by a dou
ble batteryâa retrenched campâcovert
wayâChevaux-de-fVife, &c. &c thir
teen pieces of cannon of 36, 24, &c.âs
mortarsâand 2000 chosen troopsâbe
Â£des, defended by two fires, cross-ways,
of three o'ther redoubts, which contained
3000 men,
The impetuosity of tbe republicans and
the sudden taking of this terrible redoubt,
â which appeared from its heights an inac
cefiible volcano, so affrighted the enemy,
that they immediately abandoned the reft
of the promontory, and spread in Toulon
a panic, aggravated to the lall degree,
when they law the fleet riding out of the
roads.
The fame day, I continued different at
tacks on Malbolquet and other polls.â
Then Toulon began to lose every hope.
The red redoubts, such as Pommets, Pha-
Fon, and many others, were abandoned
the following night. At length Toulon
was evacuated ; but the enemy had the
JmeJft to cover their flight, and we cou'd
not follow them, being defended by the
ramparts, the gates of which being clo
sed, rendered impracticable our p irluit.
The fiie which appeared at the head of
the port, was the firtt indication of their
departure. W.; immediately approached
; and it was not till after
that we were afiured it was abandoned by
its vile inhabitants, and the infamous co
alition, who foolill.lv pretended to make
us submit to its revolting government ;
the precipitation, with which the general
t-.u-uation was made, nearly saved us the
whole of the property, and the greatest
part of the (hipping. Toulon now deli
vered by force, all which treason had
wrelled from us. W len the divilion of
the weft of our army prepared this grand
event, that of the eait, commanded by
General I.ape; p-, advanced with Citizen
Barras, RrprtTentative of the People to
wards the mountain of Pharon, and car
ried th Srft redoubt, all the others as
well as Fort Pharon, were evacuated by
the enemy, like those of the welt. We
have l<3ft 74 or 80 of our brethren, and
the number of wounded 250. It is not
pofTible to know the loss of the enemy,
but we may judge in adding the dead and
the priloners, we have caused them a loss
during this day, more than 12,000 tight
ingmen.
Thus, Citizen Minister, has terminated
the contre-revolution of ti.e South ; we
owe it to our brave Republicans compo
sing this army, who have all well deferv
td of their country, and of whom many
individuals ought to be diitinguilhed by
national gratitud^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

triple et. r, nc less formioahfe than those
of Jema; e. Ihe head of thejr eutrcnch
ments wa-- tttacked this morning with gÂ»-cat
luccefs. The toldiers of the Kepublick took
16 pieces of cannon, 20 tilfToiis ancl 500
pnitmers, in the number of whom is found
me cciouel of the regiment,
all bedaubed v ith ribbands and crollVs; with
eight other o!Eee-s. The number of their
deiti Â» very coofiderabies We never think
ol taking prisoners, till we are tired wi.h
killir.g thin. Our loss is incoaliderable. It
would .ake up too mu h of your [.me to de
tail all the of valour of our brave
fokV s. '1 he generals wiil communicate to
you the particuUi s. This victory is the more
important, as it is tlic opening wluch con<

day in the lieid rf battle, in jhe midst of our
brethren in arms. We have ourfeives fired

NATIONAL CONVENTION.
Barrere ascends the tribuue and speaks
as follows : "Citizens, the arms of the Re
public have obtained,another triumph :
the combined efforts of our domestic in
triguers have been overcome. Crowned
robbers had meditated the deftrudlioti of
the maritime power of our nation. They
relied their hopes of success on the Ihame
ful sale of Toulon, the bribes scattered
with profulion at Brelt, and the getting
poHtfiion of Dunkirk. But the repre
sentatives of the people have preserved
Brest to the Republic, the Englilh have
fled like daltards from before Dunkirk,
and French bravery, fired with indignati
on at such complicated treachery, has made
a lall and fuccefsful effort against the ty
rants of Toulon. Thus the Englilh have
failed in their attempts against Dunkirk,
Saint Maloes, Granville, Cherbourg,
Brclt, Bourdeaux, Marfcilles, and Toulon.
Thus the Mediterranean is re-conqurcd :
that channel to the French trade is at tall
free. Already hatli the cannon* victori
ous agninll the fugi;ive Spauiards and the
d'ftroying Enjjlilh, resounded to the
Dardanelles and throughout all Italy.
Corsica will be wrelled from th? ambition
of the Paolifts, and the certainty of sup
plies will at length rellore to the South
that energy whicii it ought never tp have
loft. The most important advantage we
derive from the contjUelt of Toulon is that
it affords us abundant supplies of proviii-
After a fpeeeh repeatedly interrupted
by the applause ot the audience he reads
the following dispatches:
The Representatives of the people with
the army dire&ed against Tojlon,
OUioulei,
We announced to you that the iiTue of
the adtion of the 10th, [Nov. 30.] -was
only a prelude to greater fuccefles. The
event has juftified our predittion. Con
formably to our determination every mea
sure had been taken for driving out with
ignominy the ruffians who had baltly ob
tained poflijfion of the infamous Toulon,
and yesterday was the day appointed for
this glorious operation.
We did not lose a finÂ»le moihent ; e
ven before all the forces we expetted were
arrived, we began our attack. It was
chiefly dire&ed againftthe Englifli redoubt
which commanded the forts D'Eguillette
and Bolagnier . defended by upwards of
3000 men, 20 pieces of cannon, and se
veral mortars. The enemies had cxhautl
ed the resources of art to render it im
pregnable, and we are persuaded that few
forts are as (trongly fortified as that re
doubt. It could not however hold out a
gainll the ardor and courage of the brave
defenders of the country.
The forces of the division under the
command of Labrode and where General
Dtigomier obtained diftinguithed honor,
attacked the redoubt at 5 o'clock in the
morning, and by 6 the flag of the Re
public was seen flying in it. This success,
it is true, costs our country 200 men kil
led, and more than 500 wounded, but
the ei.emies loft their entire garrison, of
which 500 were taken prisoners, amonglt
whom arc eight officers and a Neapolitan
Prince.
Terrified at our success they abandoned
by night the forts of Maibofquet and Po
munch, the latter of which they blew up
in despair. They also evacuated .the red
and white redoubts, fort Pharon and its
redoubt, and took measures to get their
fleet out of the range of our guns and
our bombs with which they were inccf
fantly galled. The fleet is at present
without the great road. The enemies
have embarked many of the inhabitants
of Toulon and the greater part of their
forces; they have, however, left some
troops at fort la Malgue, and in the town
to toier their retreat. We are mailers of
La Croix des Sjgnaux, of fort l'A-rtique
an<f of Cape Bi.un, we hope to get pof
fefiion of la Malgue this night, <i,id to
morrow we (hall be in Toulon employed
in avfcnging the Republic.
Upw:.-rl, ot 400 oxen, some flieep and
hogs, are the only troopsfent bythe Pope,
with a few Friars. Forage, provilions
of all kinds, tents, all the camp furniture
that the enemy had in their forts and re
doubts, with upwards of a hundred pie
ces of large cannon, have fallen into our
hands.
P. S. Our colleague, Barras, who is in
the diviiion commanded by General La
poype, informs us, that all the heights of
the mountain of Pharon, have been taken
by storm, and that the fort and redoubt of
the fame name, have been evacuated, and
30 prifoneis taken, including an Englilh
Colonel.
The fame Representatives write on the
29th [Dec. 19.3 âThe infamous city
presents at this moment the most dreadful
(pettacie. The feiocious enemies of li
berty set fire to the squadron before they
fled. The arsenal is in flames. The
town is almost deserted. We meet with
no human beings but galley Oaves who
have broken their chains in the overthrow
of the kiugdom of LouisXVl. All the
polls are now occupied by the troops of
the Republic. Two explosions Which
have taken place have put us on our guard
against ambulhes of that nature, and we
defer to march the army into the town
unifl all the powder magazines be llriitly
examined. We employ our attention by
day in concerting measures for avenpng
libmvaiidth l.ravc republicans who h.ive
died for their country. The enemy's
squadron :s not yet frte from inquietude;
Ttie winds aie contrary to its putting to
sea and it may be forced to return within
the range of our batteries ; the place v. as
bombarded yeltcrday from 12 o'clock at
noon till 10 at nigh:, which precipitated
the fight of the enemies and of the cri
minal inhabitants.
Two hundred Spartiih hdrfes were found
fad died and bridled, which could not be
embarked,
in diiorder
Two iluops cFpwded with'fu
gui es were funk by our bat teries. Should
the weathei force the squadron (o keep
the sea for any time, it mutt inevitably
fuffer the most dreadful distress, evet r ves
sel being crowded with women, and the
enemy having on board at lcalt jooo'fiek.

The National Convention â â¢fter h?,\!ng
heard the report of ihe oi pub
lic fafety, decrees :
I. The army of the Republic direJHd
against Toulon hatii deserved well of the
nation.
11 There O.all be celebrated in the whoje
extent of the Republic, on the dfcade next
ensuing, the publication of this decree in
each commune, a national fcaJE to folem
nizethis happy event. The National Con
vention fliall aifilh in a body at this civic
ceremony
111. The representatives of the people
at the vifl>Â»ioi:s army at Toulon, are
charged to colleA a particular account of
the feats of heroism which re fit ft a lustre
on the re-taking of that rebellious cay.
IV. They fi-.all Leilow rewards in the
name of the Republic, on the brave citi
zens of the a any, who have signalized
themselves by great aÂ£tioiis.
V. The name of Toulon is fupprelTld;
that commune (hall henceforth be called
Port de la Montague.
_ VI. The bodies within that rebellious
city lhall be levelled with the gtound. No
thing fiiall be prcferved in it but the efta
blilliments neceflary for the service of war
and for (irovifjons and ammuni
tion.
VII. The news of the taking of THmi.
lon, Ibafl be Cent by expresses to the ar
mies arifl to the departments. To the dif
patcb of the news to the armies, (hall be
jfcined tile ftfflowing address, approved by
the Convention.
The armies of the Republic are once
more triumphant. "Toulon which had
basely fold itfelfto the English, has been
re-taken from them by an army which has
re-coucjuered that rebellious city at the
point of the bayonet, supplying by their
courage the infufficiency of number. Sol
diers of the Republic, such is the example
prefinted to you by your brothers in arms.
Will you fuffer the satellites of the des
pots any longer to fully the foil of equali
ty ? Is not victory the ccmftant reward of
your courage? Strike then, exterminate
those vile (laves who have always betaken
themselves to flight at the firft onfct of the
Sons of Liberty. Already the dastardly
E'nglifh, beaten under the walls of Dun
kirk, and driven from Toulon, are forever
overthrown. The Vendue thrice cut to
pieces in a fortnight, is hemmed in on all
fides. New advantages obtained on the
Rhine have partly repaired the losses faf
tained by former treachery, and leave on
ly Landau to be relieved. In the north,
Maubeuge is rescued from danger. Soldi
ers of the country, these fuccefles are the
fruit of your efforts for these three last
months. What can hinder you from ter
minating the campaign of liberty by the
utter detraction of the tyrants? Seize
that weapon which has already inspired
them witn such terror. l>rive them be
fore you with your bayonets, and force
them to go hide their /hame in the haunts
of slavery, and France delivered from her
enemies, will owe to you at once the hap
piness which (he will derive from the efta
blifliment of Liberty, and the glory of
having triumphed over all Europe.

Sir,
I have the honor to acquaint you, that.
the en?> y having opened a confidt.able
battery 011 the heights of Arenes, which
much annoyed one of our principal out
po.is (Malboufquet,) it became necefla
r < to attack it.- DilpofitionS for that pur
pose were made, and this morning, at 5
o'clock a corps of 400' B. itirti, 300 Sar
d.nians, 600 Neapolitans, 600 Spaniards,
and 400 French, under my command,
marched from the town. Notwithstand
ing the whole was obliged to cross the
New River by one bridge only, to di.
vide into 'four columns, to march acrcfs
olive grounds interfered by (lone walls,
and to ascend a very considerable height,
cut into vine terraces, yet we fucctÂ°ded
in surprizing an.' forcing the .enemy, and
were inon in full pefllffion of the battery
and height, but 1 am lorry to lay, that
inftead'of forming upon and occupying
the long and narrow summit of the hill,
agreeable to orders and military prudence,
the impetuosity of the troops led them to
follow the enemy, to descend the heioht,
to alcend other distant heights, and at
lafl, in disorder, to encounter such superi
or advancing numbers, as obliged them
precipitately to retire, and to relinqmfli
the advantages we at firft gained.
It is with much concern, I must add,
that Lieutenant General O'Hara, who
had ai rived at the battery on our firft fuc
cels was involved in the confluence of
this sudden reverse, Wits wounded in the
â¢arm, and made prisoner. 1
We have to icgret, that so many gal.
Jlowing de-hat officcra, and men fell or. this occa

The enemy having erected and open
ed a battery against the post of Malbouf
quet, from which (helli would reach the
town and arsenal, Governor O'Hara fig
nificd to me yelterday, his intention to
attempt to destroy it, and bring off the
guns j and tequefted some seamen to be
sent to a post he proposed to withdraw the
Britilh soldiers from. The Governor
proposed not to go out himfelf, but un
fortunately, did not keep his word. A
molt clear diftinft, and regular plan was
fettled, and the commanding officer of
the troops of each nation had a copy of
it. The troops moved at four o'clock
this morning, and surprised the redoubt
moll completely. Never was a ferviee
performed with more regularity and ex
a&nefs; but the .ardour and impetaofity
of the troops (iflftead of forming on the
height where the battery was raised, as
they were particularly ordered to do,)
led them to rush after the enemy, near a
mile on the other fide, in a very featured
and irregular manner. The consequence
of which was, the enemy collected 111
very great force; and, in the retreat of
our troops, they fuffered extremely. I
herewith transmit an account of the lofj
of the British in killed, wounded and
miffing : But Major-General Dundas will
give yon more particulars. The Gover
nor mod unfortunately was wounded and
taken prisoner. A surgeon was sent to
him immediately (by permission of Gen.
du Gomrtiier, Commander in Chief of
the Eastern Army at the siege of Tou
lon,) who reports, that the Governor's
wound is a flefh one only in the arm ; but
being faint by the loss of blood, he was
obliged to fit down under a wall, and there
nude prisoner of.

The ship Eliza, Hartley, from Liverpool
ard St. Vincent, for the Caicos, was loft on
Philips's Reef, off the Ealt Caicos, 2d Dec.
at 10 P. M. owing to the rapidity of a cur
rent setting to the weft ward. At the time the
ship struck, (he had ill fail set, standing off
shore with a lip.ht breeze from E. While
aground on iiie reef, nine miles from the
land, on the 3d of December, with a signal
of distress flying, at noon, a sloop, which
proved to be the Bermudian, Bartlett, a pri
vateer of twelve guns, belonging to Bermu
da, came to them ; when, instead of giving
relief to people in such a diftrefled situation,
the crews ot the privateer' boats, by dire<ftion
.of their officers, plundered the cargo of the
Eliza. One of them, named Ingram, who
was called Captain, was particularly active
in this lhameful business. Captain Hartley,
at the time the privateer's boats boarded the
Eliza, was making for the ihore in his long
beat, with part of the cargo ; and had, pre
vious to his leaving the ship, ordered the mate
to request the afliftance of the sloop, then
coming down to the ship. At night the mate,
with all the crew left on board, came ashore
to Captain Hartley, informed him of the
above particulars, and also told him that
while the. private r's men were plundering
the ship, they put all the officers in confine
ment. The mate, James Steel, and two sea
men, John Ramsay and John Mather, have
fincc died at Turk's Islands.
Affidavits frcm several of the officers and
feawen of the Eliza, refpeiting the brutal be
haviour of the Bermudian's people, are ob

barbarity to punirtunciu.

By captain Orne of the {hip Favorite,
who has arrived at this place from Bour
deaux, which place he left Jan. yti., we are
informed, that when he failed the embargo
oil American {hipping was not taken off,
nor was there any profpvet of itâThe
number of American veffe!s detained
there, he beleives to be about I 25. The
reason for this embargo was altogether a
mystery. The embargo extends to the
Swedilh and Danish veflels as <Vcll as to
the Americans. The cargoes of a'.l ves
sels are taken by French officers, valjed,
and paid for; but they are seldom valued
at more than half the firft colt.
A Danish vefTel had been dispatched
from that kingdom, with provisions for
the Danish crews which were fuffering in
that port, but ihc had no sooner arrived,
than her cargo was seized, except a small
allowance for the fevcral crews. Allig
nats are the principal medium of buiinefa
in France, and it is death to make any
difference between paper and specie.
Brig Penelope, George Bray, i'rom New-
York, was met in the river on the sth Janua

Extra&of a letter from Philadelphia, dated

"We bad a town meeting lad night,
and we are to support Congress with our

of, and every body fears itâfrom the con

bers of Congress, they imagine they shall
fit the grcateft part of the summer, at
least a considerable time longer than that
talked of, but they did not seem to inti
mate an embargo likely to be laid, and
said if it was, it would not be coaftways."
