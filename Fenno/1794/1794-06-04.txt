UNITED STATES.
NEW-YORK, May 47.
We think it a duty at all times to ftatd
falls ; and warn the public of dangers.'
We have repeatedly noticed In speculation
the attempts of certain violent men and
popular aliociations to dictate, dire {I, or
in some measure, to influence the proceed
ings of government. We rnuft now relate
afa 3 that sets the danger of lUch attempts
in a strong point of view. k
Soon after it was known that the Alge-'
rines had made prisoners of a number of
our American seamen, government took
the moil effectual tneafures, and the most
liberal means were provided, to redeem
those unfortunate men. These measures
have been defeated by the m'fjudged and
ill-timed benevolences of our own citizens,
who, by various means, have been endea
voring to raise money for the fame purpose â¦
by voluntary contributions. For this fact,
however fmgular, we have unquji'ionalL
authority. The truth is, the of Al
giers would demand the highest sum for
the ransom of the captives, which he could
extort from government: But learning
that money was raising by private dona
tions, he has hitherto held their redemp
tion at fueh an unconscionable price, that
no agreement can be concluded with him.
To avoid this very inconvenience go
vernment kepi the sum to be offered, pri
vate; this led people to suppose r.o mea
sures had been taken to redeem the
wretched captives; and their humanity
called for benevolent aids.
It is thus the mipguidtd zeal of some,
and the sinister views of others, are per
petually embarraffmg or wholly thwart
ing the operations of government. The
mifchiefg arising from this constant popu
lar interference with the legiflattve and
executive powers of government, are in
numerable. People choose representa
tives to meet and consult on public affairs,
and then, itrftead of confiding in their re
presentatives who have the bejl means of
information, they themselves in private
clubs, tranlient associations, formed and
acfting on partial or inaccurate statements
of fadts, undertake to direst and controul
the measures of government. In short,
they eledt men to do business, and then
do it themselves, without the means of
knowing whether their steps are right or
wrong.
This of government, this in
cessant clamor about men and measures ;
this want of confidence in public officers ;
this haftv popular zeal, inflamed by pri
vate passions and sudden impreflions;
these efforts to diforgam'ze government,
and govern by private clubs bode mifchief
and calamity to America. If the people
will have no confidence in our executive ;
if he is not permitted to manage negocia
tions entrusted to him by the constitution
and laws of the United States; we mtiy
as well dilfolve the government at onte,
and " every man to his tent, O Israel."
Baffled in his steady pursuit of publit hap
piness and prosperity, by the intrigues
and cabals'of private clubs, under foreign
influence, probably foreign money, our
good President will perhaps grow weary
of exertiftns that are useless, and will Re
tire in disgust.
It is often necessary to keep negotiati
ons between itates, private : It was so in
the cafe here mentioned. It was for the
iiitereft.of America that the people (hotild
not know what measures were taking,
until the business was doled. And if the
Americans could have reft rained their
intemperate zeal, and let government'con
duct the business, our brethren in Al
giers might probably have been, by fhis
time, retlored to their country. But'the
benevolent intentions of government and
of all good citizens are defeated, by the
too h.ijly charity of individuals. There is
no doubt that great part of the Contribu.
tors-to the} fund for the relief of the cap.
tives, have the heft intensions ; but there
Â£ Â»cr
/
Is iijtle doubt that hidhlJuah originally in
tended, ,fcy thtfe private aid 9, to thuait
aiid perplex government. It is thus tlic
â¢will of the gvc.it body of freeman in Amer
ica is fubjett to the control of influence of
little parties and clubs. In the fame man
ner, private ehibs are endeavoring to Slur
ry Congrcls to declare war at once against
1 Great Britain, without taking any prt;li
minarv ftt'ps, required by the laws and Â«f
---ages of nations; We are happy howevir
to tin;) the people in the interior northern
- states, with great unanimity, reprobate all
clubs fin tired to influence public meafnres,
and consider them as unoonftitutiunal and
dangerous/
Front the General Advertiser.
FROM A CORRESPONDENT.
We have lately seen an attempt, in the
Gazette of the United States, to (belter
the appointmeut of Mr. Jay, chief justice
of the United States, to the office of en
Â» vgy to the court of Great Britain from
tlie censure to which it was justly exposed,
by an attack upon that of Mr. Monroe
laleje.ijitffij; from Virginia, as minister to
tie French Republic, which-jjaerits a fhprt
v comment. ' V
it is I'carcely neceflary to obferrc, that
if the cases were parallel they must be ei
ther both oonftitutional or otherwise ; if
they were not, that neither can be juitified
or crimrnateA by the other } that they
flarfd respectively upon their own merits
by whichalone tiiev must be tested. These
portions are too clear to admit of any
doubt, in the n.ind of a discerning public.
Nor can there be any divcrfity of sen
timent with rejpedt to the principles by
which they mult be teited. That the
three departments of government, the ex
. ecutive, legislative aed judicial, Ihould be
kept Teparate, dill:neb and independent of
each other, is a political truth too well
eftablilhed at the present day, to be deni
ed by a'iy one. It is well known, that
the national and ail the state governments
are founded on this principle. Indeed in
moil of them great ingenuity has been
displayed in an effort to complete this
separation and perfect the independence of
each on the other ; and it is universally
admitted that the government in which
tnis efFort has been molt fnccefeful has at
tained the nearelt to perfection.
That Mr. Jay was of this opinion up
on a former occasion, will appear by the
following extract from the memorial orre
monftrance of the circuit judges of the
United States at New-York, to congress,
and which was signed by himfelf.
" That by the conflitution of the U
fiited States the government thereof is
divided into three diftinft and independ
ent branches and that it is die duty of
each toabftain from ami oppose incroach
ments on either.
That neither the legjjlature nor the ex
ecutive branches can conltitutionally assign
so the judicial any duties but such as are
properly judicial and to be performed in a
judicial manner."
Thus we find, when it was fought, by
the legifiature, to charge the judiciary |
with the fetdement uE the claims of the
invalid soldiers, the chief justice was a
kiiTttcd for the independenee of that de
partment ; but when invited to fill an ex
ecutive office whicfi tended to his own ad
vancement in honor and emolument, and
especially one which furnifhed an opportu
nity of visiting the associates of the fac
tion in England, all apprehension of the
kind, ast jealotify refpefting the union of
the departments vani.'hed.
Will it be contested, that the independ
ence of the Judges may not be more fa
tally undermined and destroyed by execu
tive influence, provided it may be aflailed
i in that line, than the imposition of new
duties by the legislature ? And what influ
-1 ence is more powerful in its effedt on the
human heart, than the right of dispensing
011 those who are must accommodating and -
obfeqtiious, additional offices of honor and
profit? And is it not to be presumed, if
the door to executive offices, (hould like
wile be opened to the Judges, that inttead
of forming a barrier or ltrong wall of pro
tection in favor of the people, against ex
cutivc encroachments, they would soon
become the mere fycophantsof courtsand
tools of power ?
It will be perceived that the only ob
jection to eithei appointment, confilts in
the pofltffion and exercise of two offices,
' each in a separate department of the go
vernment, by the fame person and at the
fame time : And it is admitted that the
obje&iftn applies with equal, force, whe
ther they be legiffative arid executive, or
judicial and executive, for in both cases,
two departments of the government are
blended together, ar*i the independence
arid check contemplated by the conftituti
or. destroyed. Had Mr. Jay religned the
office of Judge, when he accepted that of
Envoy Extraordinary, there would have
been no objetSiorv in that refpeft, to his
appointment; for it never was contended
that a periou holding an office in any
branch of the government, might not be
appointed from that to one in any other
department. By holding both offices,
therefore, Mn jay has justly exposed
himfelf to the censure which has been bes
towed upon a conduct so improper. But so
soon as the latter appointment was confer
red on Mr. Monroe, it is well known that
he immediately religned the other, and
withdrew from the Senate ; the objecti
ons then which have been urged with such
peculiar force againftthe former, are whol
ly inapplicable to the latter.
If the appointment of Mr. Jay was con
stitutional being understood at the
time, and verified by the event, that he
intended to hold both offices J it will be dif
ficult to (hew any impropriety in Mr.
Monroe's eonduft in oppofrng it. He
was at the time a Senator, and charged
by his oath, to preserve the conltitution
inviolate. If he deemed this a violation,
it was his duty to oppose it, and he
would have been unworthy the trust repo
sed in him by his country, if he had
shrunk from it.
Whether it was proper for Mr. Mon
roe to accept the appointment which was
conferred on him by the President and
Senate, the public will determine. If
it suited his convenience to serve his coun
try in that line, was desired by many at
home, and there was reason to believe it
would be acceptable to the French repub
lic, why Ihould he not accept it ? Can any
good reason be affigncd, why he should
flight the favorable disposition of his coun
try, thus honorably expressed, and at a
very interesting crilis of public affairs ?â
Can it be urged that he solicited the ap
pointment or courted it, by any unmanly
or degrading accommodation, in his pub
lic conduit ? Will a firm and decided op
polition to such nominations as he thought
unconstitutional and otherwise improper,
be deemed such, for these are the only!
objedtions which have been alledged a
gainst him \
It is generally understood, that the
trust was offered to Mr. Monroe, by the
Pi efident, and that the firft and only a
gency he had in the business was, in de
tei mining that he would not decline it; a
circumstance which reflects honor on the
person who conferred, as well as on him
who accepted the appointment.
Every candid reader will now decide
how far the two cases which have been
brought into view are parallel. In one
cafe Mr. Jay, Chief Juttice of the United
States, being appointed to an executive
office, has accepted the fame without re
lifiquifhing his judicial office, in violation
of the principles of the constitution
which he has taken an oath to support,
in neglcft ot his duties as a judge which
he has sworn faithfully to discharge, and
in fubverlion of that independence on the
executive department which, on another
occasion, he himfelf had so ftrenuouflv
a Her ted.
In the other cafe, Mr. Monroe, a Se
nator of the United States having accept
ed an executive appointment, immediately
rehnquiihed his feat in the Senate, from
a refpeft to the principles of the constitu
tion which he had taken an oath to sup
port ; in conformity to the doctrines he
had before maintained with refpeft to the
incompatibility of offices in different de
partments, and without an attempt, or
wish, to retain a place, the duties of
which he w as rendered unable to discharge
by his undertaking those of another.

~A r n< 7 for granting the sum of two
thousand dollars, to the widow of Robert
Fortyth, late Marshal of the diftria of Geor

the President of the United States, commu

tor an advance of money, on account of the
debt due to France, was taken into consider

tion was taken up on Monday, and after
some discussion was negatived, 39 to 38.
A bill received from the Senate entitled an
acl in addition to the ail for the puni(hment
of certain crimes against the United States,
was also taken into consideration on Mon
day ; the firft feflion of the bill is in the
following word : " If any person (hall, with

States, accept or take a jcommiffion to Jerve
a foreign prince or state, in was, by land or

This section on motion of Mr. Nicholas,
was after some debate, struck out in com
mittee of the whole, 39 to 38 âbut was
restored by the House after an amendment'
which provides that nofuch cornrhiffon (hall
be cxercized
Mr. Nicholas thfen moved to strike out
a part of the second fe&ion, which punishes
a man for cJniifting in foreign service, or for
going out of the limits of the United States,
to enlist in foreign service ; and he proposed
an amendment instead of it.
This amendment was negativedâas was
a motion to expunge the foiirthâ¢fedlion.
It was next moved to ftrik'e out the seventh
feiflion which stood as follows:
" And be it further enacfted, that it (hall
not be lawful to fell, within the United States,
any vessel or goods captured from a prince
or state, or from the fubjecls or citizens of a
prince or state, with whom the United States
are at peace, which vessel or goods (hall have
bten captured by any other foreign prince
or state, or by the fubjetfls or citizens of such
prince Or state ; unless such vessel and goods
shall have been firft carried into a port or
place within the territory of the prince Or
state to which the captors belong, but such
vessel and goods (hall be carried (tat ps, the
United States,by those whofhall brortght
them in. And the sale of any veflel or goods
prohibited as aforefaid, (hall be utterly void."
Some debate took place on this motion,
the clause was at length expunged, 46 to 37
âthe bill was passed as amended.
The following remarks on the last mo
tion were offered by Mr. Goodhut.
Mr. Goodhue observed, that the fubjea
lay within a very narrow compass. If by
our treaty with France they had a right to
fell their prizes in our ports, there was no
thing more to be said. If they had no such
right by trealy, then it was to be considered
how far giving them this right would be a
violation of our present neutrality. As to the
treaty, Mr. Jefferfon our late Secretary of
State, in his correspondence communicated
to us the present session, had explicitly said
that no such claitn could be made by France,
by virtue of our treaty with them, to such a
measure; and indeed if we look into the
treaty which France made with Great Bri
tain in 1786,lfevÂ»ral years after th.e one they
had formed with us, we (hall have all doubts
removed on the true conftruflioi} which
ought to be had upon the article mutually
existing between us, by virtue of which such
a right is pretended ; for in the treaty they
made with Great Britain, they expressly fli
pulated that in cafe either party (hould be at
war with any other nation, no prizes ox' the
one being so at war (hall be fold in (he ports
of the other; consequently had it happened
we had been at war with Great Britain and
France had remained in peace, we could not
by the article in our treaty with them, have
had such an indulgence. Indeed, the gen
tleman from Virginia, Mr. Madison, seems
to give up the right, and takes it up on the
ground of expediency, and not having 3
tendency to violate our neutrality. Mr. Jef
ferfon has also in his correspondence laid
down this principle, that if a neutral nation
granted a favor to one belligerent power
which (he withheld from the other, it was
so far a violation of neutralityâthis princi
ple was incontrovertible.
Mr. Madison had said we had not heard
that the Briti(h government had complained
on this score to our minister at London, but
tho' that was true, it was nevertheless true
that their minister here had made complaint
of it to us, and Mr. Goodhue was of opinion
that in fettling our accounts with Great Bri
tain for the spoliations they have committed
on our commerce, they would as a
charge against us the prizes made of their
vessels, which we had permitted the sale of
in our ports, he therefore hoped the clause
would not be struck out agreeably to the
motion for that purpose. Mr. Goodhue fur
ther observed, that it had given him much
pain to have seen so many amendments pro
posed in the progress of this bill, to deprive
the executive and judicial powers of this go
vernment from being vested with that autho
rity, so essentially necessary to reilrain the
licentious from committing such a<sis, as un
questionably hazarded the tranquility of our
country.

Suppression of the Executive Council, and

Carnot, in the name of the Committee of
Public Welfare, having demonstrated all the
incompatibility of an Executive Council with
a Republican Government, even the danger
which results from it to Liberty, propoiedv
the ftipprefiion of all theMinifters. " The
real friend of the people," said Carnot,
" is he who fuffers himfelf to be long looked
after beiore he accepts any public functions,,
who Withdraws from them as Toon as possible,
and poorer than when he alTiuned them, and
who returns among his equals to lead a quiet
irreproachable life."
Carnot terminated by proposing the fol

is The Declaration of ibe King of PruJJiajothe

thus :
e 0 Afterws, at is pad, every hope of the
Subiifience being acceded to, being no*
vamfhed, Â« His Majesty does n6w re
s ''ounce the farne, and also every Refo
" lution of the Empire and of the Cir
cles relative thereto. His Majesty has,
therefore, taken the Resolution no lon
ger tft grant his Protection to the Ger
e << raa " m P' re: âBut, to order his Ar
" tw enty thousand Aux
" ilnrids, according to different treaties)

At the fame time that his Majesty finds
hitafelf compelled to withdraw a portion
of his Troops from the defence of those
States, for which they have already com
bated with so much glory, he expresses
the mod earned wiihes, that those con
fluences he has above alluded to may not
take place, bijt that the exertions of his
Imperial Majesty, and of the Empire,
may eventually insure to both a full indem
nity> and a general and honorable Peace.
To his Mijefty remain the just confuta
tion, and permanent glory of haying on
his part made such facrilices to the de
fence and fafety of the Emperor in the
present awful crisis, as certainly few
States in Europe, or Members of the
Germanic Body, could, without much
nefitation, have resolved upon.
Berlin, March 13,' 1794.
April 12.
It was last: night reported, that an ac
count had been received by a bye boat
from Oltend, thnt Danton and his confe
derates had been executed. This seems
very probable, as we know they were
upon their trial on the 3d and 4th inft.
Yesterday morning Mr. Shaw and Mr.
Wiliiil, king's meflengers, arrived with dis
patches, one from Vienna, the other from
the-Duke of York's head quarters at St. A
mand. Nothing of any cohfequence had oc
curred;. A Hanoverian out-poft had been
surprised, but a reinforcement coming up,
the enemy had been obliged to retire with loss
â  An important movement was e*pe<Jted to
be made in a few days.
The Emperor was expected to arrive at
Â£>ru(ftls on tfte 9th. The greatest prepara
tions were making to receive him with eve
ry mark of respect and affe&ion on the part
of the people.
Several of the papers, in which it is de
termined that the ruling party of France at
all times fhal! appear refpedtable, will now
have jt, that Danton has been guilty of the
crime of peculation, but that Koberfpierre's
hands are clean ; though it is forgot, while
this is sard, that Roberfpirre is in office, and
that Danton never was, as also, that it ever
has been allowed that the latter, knave as he
is, is open and bold, and the former cunning
and eowardly..

General Ricardos died at Madrid on the
19th ult. The Count O'Reilly was appoint
ed to succeed him ; but he died on his route
to take the command of the army. The
count de la Union consequently has been ho
nored with the chief command, and like
wise Governor and Captain General of Cata
lonia. He is a very young man, but very
much beloved by the troops.
There is much difference of opinion in the
Spanish council refpedling the continuance of
the war ; and the Duke D'Alcudia has had
the influence to fend M. D'Aranda into exile
for some free observations against the mea
sures of the court.

the blessings of peace.
" We hope the inftrU<3ious ifTtied by
this government on the Bth of January,

any future mifundcrftandirigs.

The Public are cautioned to
be<ware of counterfeited Five Dollar Bills cf
the Bank of the United States, and Twenty {â 
Dollar Bills of the Bank of North America, I
several of <wbich have appeared in circulation ,
within a few days pajl; they are a good ge
neral imitation of the genuine Bills, but may
be dijlinguifhed by the following
marks.
Five Dollar Bills of the Bank of the
United States. t
ALL that have appeared have the letter F. \
for their Alphabetical Mark. r
The Texture of the Paper is thicker and a
whiter knd it takes the iok more freely than
the genuine paper. c
The O. in the Word Company is smaller
than theM. and other letters of that word,
so that a line extended from the top of the O,
to tbuch the top of the M. would extend cou
fi'dcrably above the range of the whole word.
In the word United the letters are narrow- 4
erand closer together than thv reft of the bill
The t and fiu the word promise are not (
parallel, the yinclining much moie forward
than the i.
The engraving is badly executed,the strokes j
of all the Letters are stronger and the device
in the margin pafticularly isrm'uch coailer and ,
appears darker than in the true bills. Some ,
ot the counterfeits bear date in 1791 âWhere- (
as the Bank was not in operation till Decern
ber, and no five dollar bills were iflued in
jhat year.
Twenty Dollar Bills of the Bank of North
America.
ALL that have appeared have the letter
B. for their alphabetical mark.
They are printed on a paper nearly similar
to that of the couuterfeit Five Dollar Notes
above described ; the engraving is bettei exe
wcted, and they approach neaier to the ap
pearance of tne genuine bills.
The fine ruled lines through the word Tu.cn
tvy in the iJhdy of the bill, are in number thir
teen in the gen dine blls, and but twelve in
the counterfeit*.
The word Company is much like the fame
word in the Five-Dollar Bills as defer ibed a
bove, the 0 being leis tlian .the 7/2, and others
following.
There is no stroke to the t in the word North
whereas in the genuine bills the stroke is well
defined.
The letters ent in the word Twenty, to the
left hand at the bottom, do not come down to
the line, but are <0 cut as to give an irregular
appearance to the word, the Tw and go
ing below'them.
The fignaiurc J Nixon, has the appear
ance of being written with lamb-black aod
oil, and differs from other inks used in
printing the bills and the cafliier's signature;
It is supposed these forgeries were committed
in some of the Southern States, as all the coun
terfeits thai jiave. appeared, have come Irom
thence, and two peiions have been apprehend
ed in Virginia, on suspicion ot being the author
of them.
The reward of ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS
will be <paid to any PeHon or Pcifons w4io-ftva!l
discover and profecute-tactmviftion the several
offenders of the following.defenptions or any
'of them, viz.
The perfori or pcrfons, who manufa&ured
the paper on which the Bills are printed.
â¢The pei sou or peifons* who engraved the
plates.
The printer or printers, of the bills.
Every person who hasa&ed as a principal in
any other way, in the couttterleii-ing and utter
ing the said bills.
Philadelphia, 28, 1794
â April 22, 77.94,
' Other counterfeit bills
of the Bank of the United States have appeared
in circulation.
The denomination is of TWENTY DOL
LARS,and the alphabetical maik is the let
ter Â£.
They may be distinguished from the genu
ine by the foMowiirg IVI'A PiKS :
The paper of the counterfeits is of a more
e tender texture and glofley furface than the
D genuine, and there is no water mark in them.
Tke letter C. in the-word Calhier f in the
S true bills isftrongly marked, whereas in the
counterfeits, the whole letter is a fine hair
e stroke, evidently in.an unfiniilied llate. .The
letters in the word demand, is badly lormtd
and the whole woid iTI done, and there is no
comma at the eud of it, as there is in the
genuine bills.
>â¢ The marginal device, is much daiker in
g the falfe, than in the genuine bills owing to
n the fhadfc strokes being coarser, much nearer
f together,:and ronfequently much mote tiu
-- merous. difference fti ikes the eye at fir it
view.
The fame reward of ONE THOUSAND
j, DOLLARS, will be paid for &:

THEgrand principle of Equality, if .right

universal justice,. sacred order, and perfect
