The Public are cautioned to
beware of counterfeited Five Dollar Bills of
the Bank of the United States, and Twenty
Dollar Bills of the Bank of North America,
fe-veral of which have appeared in circulation
within a few days pajl; they arc a good ge
neral imitation of the genuine Bills, but may
be diftingui/hed by the following
MARKS.
*diot
ALL [that have appeared hay; the letter F.
tor their Alphabetical Mark.
The|Texture of the Paper is thiekcr and
whiter and it takes the ink more freely than
the genuine paper.
The O. In ihe word Company is smaller
than the M. and other letters of th.it word,
so that a line extended from ihe top of the O,
to touch the top of the M would extend coo
liderably above the range of the whole word.
In the word United the letters are narrow
erand ekifer together than the reft of the bill
The 1 and fin the word promile are not
parallel, the yinclining much more forward
than the i.
The engraving is badly executed,the strokes
of all the Letters are ft rouge r and the devii e
in the margin particularly isuiuch coaifcr and
appears darker than in the true bills. Some
a bear date in l;9iâ.Where
as the Bank was not in operation till Decern.-.
ber, and 110 five dollar bills were ifiued in
that year.
Twenty Dollar Bills of the Bank as North
ALL that have appeared have the letter
B for their alphabetical mark.
They are printed on a paper nearly fimilac
to that of the counterfeit Five Dollar Notes
above described; the engraviug is better exe
cuted, and they approach nearer to tne ap
pearance of the genuine hills.
The fine ruled lines through the word Twen
ty, in the body of the bill, are in number thir
teen in the genuine bills, and but twelve in
the counterfeits.
The word Company is much like the fame
word in the Five Dollar B lis as defer ibed a.
bove, the 0 being left than them, and others
fallowing.
Their is no stroke to the tin the word North
whe eas in tile genuine bills the ltrokcis well
defined.
dâtf
The let!ers ent in the word Twenty, to the
left hand at the bottom, do not come down to
the line, but are so cut as to give an irregular
appearance to the word, the Tw and ihej> go
ing below them.
The Siguature J Nijcon, has the appear,
ante of bring written with larap-blaclc and
oil, and differs from the other inks used in
priming the biils and the calhier's lignature.
It is supposed these forgeries were committed
in feme of the Southern States, as all the coun
terfeits thai have appeared, have come from
thence, and two persons have been apprehend
ed in Virginia, on suspicion of being the authors
of them.

* A CARD.
The Citizen was acquainted with the
circnmftance of the luciy return of Mr.
Sââ's veflelâhowever as Hie had not
been many days out, thequeftion he put,
was not out of order. The citizen is glad to
hear that Mr. S. is done with the Britifli,
and by their late reprehensible conduct,
Mr. S. concludes that they have done with
him. To descend to particulars, the Ci
tizen wi(hes that Mr. S. had been a little
more correct and clear in some of hisftate
ments, as it would have saved, him the
trouble of racking his imagination to state
them more cleat ly. The (hip Adtive he
conceives to be detained undor the general
order, to interrupt all fuppKes of provisi
ons to France. The Mercury though im
properly intetrupted by the captain of a
Britilh frigate, was fuffered to fell her car
go at Jamaica, and Mr. S. no doubt is in
pofleflion of the valuable returnsâcan all
the owners of vessels whose cargoes have
been fold in French ports fay as much ?
Are they not often valued and taken by
officers of thitu:dmirailc government which
Mr. S. has so much confidence in, at less
than the original coil, without the cap
tains' being allowed any voice in the cafe
âand then it has not always happened
that they have been paid tor them, even
according to their own valuation. With
Tefpeft to the John, Mr. Sâi 's fiea
vieft loss, it is said "that this reflel was at
the time employed in carrying wheat ihe
British had taken for their own account,
though dellined for St. Maloes from one
of their own ports, before the war between
France and Great Britain was declared."
The C. declares that he is so dull of com
prehension as to be unable to make out
the meaning of this, but if he may'be al
lowed to give a guess at it, the meaning
of it is thisâThis veflel was employed by
somebody to carry wheat from a Britilh
port to a French port, contrary to an a m
of the Britilh Parliament, or an order of
the King and privy council, (1 am not
certain which) ifliied some time before the
war broke oufclâflie was taken in the fad,
and the conlequences probably were as
Hated by Mr. S.â(he was employed in a
trade in violation of the laws of an inde
pendent nation ; and however Mr.S 's
loss is to be lamented, the veflel deserves
no pity for her untimely fateâbut what
was Mr. S about not to calculate his
rifle in time, and be paid before hand as
the wary Danes and Hamburghers ? It
would be paying a poor compliment to
Mr. Sâââ's sagacity, to suppose that
he was behind hand with the mod cautious
of them, in this or any other instance where
caution was necefiary. Having succeeded
in the developement of the causes of this
misfortune wrapped up in such myflerious
language as at firil fight to preclude a hope
of the possibility of an unravelment, what
are Mr. S 's grievances reduced to ?
The solitary and single cafe of the A&ive
detained at FalmouthâMr. S. does not
tell us, that (he is libelled, condemned, or
adjudicated, and his grievance is the less,
as he had timely notice of the rifle of all
vefiels bound to France with pravifionsV
except riceâthe propriety of the order
which placed those veflcls under such ha
zardous circumstances will be difcuifed
elsewhereâis it is new and #hat was never
done before in time of war, Mr. S. will
please to take notice that they are not
without a trans Atlantic example for adopt
ing what was never adopted before.âThe
Citizen never doubted of Mr. S. having
derived considerable emolument from liw
trade with the ports as Franceâbut-that
was not the question he put, lie nK-iely
teok tbe liberty of alking how nianv velTels
he had lately tent to the ports of France,
meaning perhaps a month before he dis
patched his last. veiJelfor-Falraouth âThe
C. is happy to hear that Mr. S. has no
thing to fear for his vessel which the Con
vention has in their wisdom embargoed at
Boiirdeauxâdoes not this ihew that Mr.
S. is -always upon his guard and cautious
to provide against the worfl: ? In every in
stance, but in the unfortunate cafe of the
John it has appeared so; being Â£0 fortunate
ly istuated he has no occasion to do what
others have been compelled to do, viz. to
bribe the National Commissaries, as Mr.
S. chufes to call them.
With rtfpeft to the epithets which Mr.
S. willies to bestow on the Bntifh govern
ment for their late conduct, the Citizen
replies, that the diftrefles occasioned by
war, arealways to be lamented upon what
ever people thry fallâbut the C. will again
remind Mr. S. that the government under
which we ourselves live, and enjoy pro
te&ion, arc not guiltless of being the cause
of diiirefs to a large class of innocent in
dividuals.
Congress of the United States.
House of R eprefentatiws
SublUnce of the remarks made by Mr. Giles
on the ioth of March 1794, upon the
question for the passage of the bill provi
ding a naval armament.
Mr. Giles commenced his remarks by ob
serving, that from the Jenfe of the houi'e k
veral times manifefted upon this subject, there
remained no doubt but that the bill would
pass. In that event, he moll earnestly hoped
that the success of the measure, would at
least equal the expectations of its advocates:
Indeed he hoped that their expectations would
be disappointed and exceeded ; for it did not
seem to him that even thev were very poii
tive as to its full competency to the end pro
posed. He even wifibed that every fliip could
be furmfhed with the cap of Fortunatus and
the lhield of Hercules ; for he was persuaded,
that in the prelent Hate of things some ma
gical influ.nce, would be found efltntial to
enable them to effect their undertaking. He
observed that at present, the wtfdon or lolly
of the proposed measure, was mere flatter
of opinion, but the passage of the bill will
furnifh futurity with a compleat experiment
of its true character.
He intended to offer his reasons against the
passage of the bill, not with a hope of mak
ing proselytes, but as a tcftimony of the real
motives which influenced his opposition.
With this view he ihould only mention l'ome
of the general impressions produced on his
mind by this fubjeift, without fatiguing the
house with minute exemplifications of them.
Thefubjedl had p'refented itfelf to hiiri in
two points of viewâ:ift. As affording a pro
te<Sion to our commerce against the Algerine
depredations, id. As the foundation of a
permanent naval eftabluhment.
He could not help premising, that in the
course of discussion the advocates of the bill,
had ceniured its opponents with a want of
disposition for the proteAion of commerce,
whilst they claimed a monopoly of ail good
intention towards this objeit. He did not
mean to derogate from the good intention of
the favorers of the bill, but he believed its op
ponents possessed as pure a zeal for the pro-
And due encouragement of commerce,
as its advocates. It is not a question, whe
ther commerce is, or is not, to be protected ;
but whether the plan proposed be the most
effe&ual and the least exceptionable, thai can
be devised for that pnrpole ? The difference
of opinion does not consist in the aid to be
produced ; but in the means propqjed to tjftll
the end.
The firli objection he Ihould make to the
bill, would be, the obvious inadequacy of the
means contemplated, to efle<st the end propo
sed by them. The object proposed, is an ef
fectual refinance not only to the whole pre
sent naval force of Algiers, but to their whole
naval ability. The bill contains in itfelf ef
lentially a declaration of war: our calcula
tions therefore ihould be extended to the ut
moll limit of the uaval ability of the hostile
nation. The means to l>e employed conlilt
of 4 frigates of 44 guns each, ana a ftips of
36 guns each. To decide with propriety up
on the objection, this force Ihould be com
pared with the naval ability of Algiers. He
did not mean to go into a minute biftorv of
Algiers ; he Ihould only observe in general,
that it \<'as a populous country, that it had
furnilhed at one time 100,000 fighting men,,
that its power at this day, was as great as at
any preceding period ; that they were a war
like people, accustomed to naval enterprises,,
and desperate in naval engagements; that
forfome time part, they had been-fiibfidized
for peace by almost every European nation ;
he could not help concluding irom these cir
cumltances that the naval ability of the na
tion either was or might, without any un
common exertions, be rendered fupenor to
four 44 gun frigates and two 36 gun Clips,
the force contemplated by tÂ£e bill; and if
the coucluiions were juii, the bill is unwise.

jxrtioon tor naval power, with the nations of
iolopc. Naval exertions ha v e been carried
to tach excels, that there istcafcdy any thing,
which funajha mote feopefbr comparifou.
Several nations poSeSag a much greater na
val ftnrngtli than is contempiatcd by this bill,
he bditrd, were at war with Algiers at this
moment, jet her coriairs swim in the ocean
rtgandkfo of their enemy, and hardly recol
lecting that they are in a fbte of war. He
tiixigit it unfafe to calculate upon any pecu
liar is vincibilhy in the armament now propo
sed, and without fiich a quality although he
hoped their efficacy, yet he feared their inel'-
ficacy.
He should Fear the refult,-if the con
tell in other ftfpe&s were \p be upon e
qnal terms, but that will not be the cafe.
The armament will meet with peculiar
embarraismcnt from the expected scene of
a&ion. They are to ast 3,000 miles
from home without the guarantee or even
the profpectof a friendly port, they are
( to continue the uhole year upon their Ra
tion/ and >to befubjeft to attack whenever
the enemy may think proper, they will
alio be contiuually exposed to a tempestu
ous ocean; under these circumrtances
they mull ast upgn the moil difadvauta
geous terms, whrch will lefTen extremely
their profpeft of success- The advocates
of the bill have admitted the necessity of
finding some â¢ friendly ports in the Medi
terranean seas, and several hate been men
tioned, Carthagcna, Gibraltar, &c. &c.
but their hopes appeared to him to be
wholly chimerical.
He did not know how far it might be
proper to have reference to confidential
communications, to present this part of
the fubjeft in its true light. He thought
however, he- might be permuted to men
tion in general, that it has been officially
communicated to the House, that the truce
with Algiers, which has produced the in
jury to our commerce, agSinft which the
present remedy is directed, is part of the
lyllem of the combination ajniinft France.
The mildest apology from Great-Britain,
for her interposition, has been, to enable
Portugal to ast more efficaciÂ»ufly in the
common cause of despots. Other effects,
equally important to that end, willrefult,
and no doubt, were taken into t*ie esti
mate. They all may resolve themselves in
to the embarrassments produced to our
commerce. Tin's information cafinot be
questioned. If then the Algerine truce
be part of the fyltem of the combination
again ft France, is it probable, that the
combined powers, will afford their ports
for the protection of an armament, in
tended to interrupt and destroy that part
of the fyfteni ; May it not rather be in
ferred, that they will fend theiraid to their
allies, the Algerines, to destroy the fores
sent against them ? Have we hopes against
this natural and obvious consequence,
from the good dispositions of the combi
ned powers towards us ? Hare we any
hopes from their inability, to effect the
objeit: For his part, he thought it was
in vain to hope for a contrary result.
From these refk-ftions, occurs another ob
vious objection to the measure, its direst
tendency to war. Upon another occasion
it has been said, that Great Britain parti
cularly, is irritiable towards us, and all
meafuies ought to be avoided, which
might tend to cncreafe the irritability. It
really has become a question for this
House, for all America, to determine,
and particularly the lovers of peace, whe
ther a naval armament, calculated ro refill
pap of the system of the conibina ion a
gainst France, and destined to ast in the
very scene of war; or imposing higher
duties upon feme articles of imports, and
making an acl for the regulation of onr
own navigation, possess the greatefl ten
dency to war i
For his part, if the propofcd armament
should be provided, he had but one confo
latioa againfl this palpable effca of it
But that confsilation fumiihed the strong.
eft argument against the measure. The
trees are now growing, out of which thefrigates are to be built. A considerable
time must of course elapse, before thele
trees can be put into the ftiape of sri-
gates.
From the. present agitation and Humili
ation of European affairs, great changes
before that time may be effe&ed, and the
neceflary delay in equipping the armament
will be the only chance of avoiding a war
by means of the measures.
If the frigates were now afloat, and en
gaged in the expedition againtl Algiers,
helhould view the United States in a state
of actual hostility against the whole com
bined powers.
But the neceflary delay which may
furnifh the only security against war, as a
result of the measure, proves the folly of
an expensive armament, which, before it
â  an be provided, the fluctuation of Euro
pean affairs, may render wholly unnecef
i'ary.

St. JOHN'S (Antigua) Feb. 25
The accounts received lalt week from
St. Kittsi of the capture of Fort Bourbon
in Martinique, are contradicted in that
I (land, it seems, by hand bills circulating
when the Mail Boat left it on Saturday.
By accounts from Montferrat, carried
thither by one of the Privateers,it appears,
that the British army had carried by as
sault, a Redoubt called Bouille, after a fe
yere contest, in which we loft 22 killed,
and 37 wounded ; fifteen Mulattoes and
five Whites, found there, were put to the
bayonet. From this redoubt, it is said,
Fort Bourbon may be battered in breach ;
(hould that be the cafe, we have no doubt,
that our gallant countrymen will soon cap
ture it. Fort Bourbon is attacked by 3
columns, one under Sir Charles Grey,
another under Ceneral Dundas, the third
under Colonel White- General Prefcot
commands one of the detachments a&ing
against Gros Morne and St. Pierre, and
Colonel Myers the other. Bellegardes,
second in command, ha* been taken and
handed; and the greateftdiflenfion prevailed
in Fort Bourbon. Rochambeau talks of
funender, the garrison will not attend to it;
and none will take the command of that
important Fortress. Our batteries play
incessantly upon it, and the fire of the
garrison is very weak indeed. They are
principally annoyed from a Bomb battery
of seventeen 22 inch Mortars;

Extra# of Letters from MefTrs. BIRD,
SAVAGE and BIRD, Merchants in Lon
don, to their Correspondent in this town,
dated as under. -
January i, 1794.
AMERICAN merchants, and the Gentle
men of Lloyd's Coffee-Houfe, have experi
enced a great degree of alarm, in conse
quence of inftruftions, dated 6th of Novcm-
Jtr, V"f not ITued until the last of Decem
ber*. The great ground of alarm was a
misapprehension that the terms flop and de
tain, and bring to legal adjudication, meant
a condemnation. But the merchants have
had a meeting about it: and our Mr. H. M.
BIRD was of the committee, who went to
the Admiralty PROCTOR and Mr. DUN
DAS, to require an explanation of the in
ftruilionsâthe result of which is, that the
term " legal adjudication" means no more
than that i'uch cargoes (hould be brought to
trial, to find out if they are not French pro
pertyâbut if they are found to be American,
they will be released, fubjeit only to charges,
as there are grounds of suspicion fufficient to
juftify the detention arising from a dil'covery
haviug been made that property is frequently
mailced. This only relates to cargoes landed
in and (hipped from America.
But the committee, under Mr. Dundas's
directions, are preparing a petition, to mi
nistry, of such a modification as would
relieve vessels laden in America, on Ame
rican accouht, with French colonial pro
duce for Europe, if not bound to France,
and we hope to be able to fend you a fa
vorable account from ministry, by our rlext.
This information you may deem authen
tic, and as it probably may be of a differ*
ent tenor from other letters frond hence,
it may be proper to make it public."
* ErrorâThis order issued in Nov.
January 10, 1794-
" WE have the pklfure to hand you a
copy of frefli Inftruftions, which have been
iflued, in consequence of the representations
of the Committee of American Merchants
to His Majesty's Ministers, which we flatter
ourselves will give as much fatisfacHon in
America, as we experience, and that it may
tend to strengthen the friendlhip and good
understanding between the two countries, so
eflentially to the prosperity of both. The de
lays arising in the Commons, do not reft with
Ministers, bat with the Judge, who presides
in the Admiralty Court, and they (hew a
disposition to redress this grievance, by re
moving him, if it can be done."
Her follow the inJlruJlionj publi/hed in our
paper of Friday lajl.
Extraifl df a letter dated January 11, 1794,
from a mercantile house of the firft refpec-
tability m London.
" WE have now the fatisfcicftion to ac
quaint you, that the memorial of our mer
chants, has been attended to, and that the
order of Council of 6th November, is res
cinded, and in lieu thereof, the following
iflued:
"To stop and detain all shipS laden with
produce of the French IHinds, coming dircil
from the IQands to Europe," and likewise
" all {hips laden with Frcnch property, and
to bring them into' our ports, for legal adju
dication."
By which you will observe, that the trade
between the Islands and America is not af
fefledâand we are persuaded from this de
liberate discussion, and from the consequent
order, that the property bona fide American,
and coming diredl from America, will be
prote<sledâbut all produce of the French
Islands coming direfl from the Islands to
Europe, will if captured be confifcated âlet
the property belong to whom it may.
The militia of Maflachufetts consists of
eighty regiments of infantry, of nearly one
thousand men each ; the major part in uni
form. Thirty companies of artillery, in
compleat uniform, with two pieces of field
artillery each, principally brass ; and upwards
of ten squadrons of cavalry, in uniform, all
officered, and compleatly equipped.
The whole of this force is in the field four
times a year annually in detachments j be
sides being multered and reviewed by the ma
jor-generals of DiviHons in large bodies, col
lected to a central point by regiments and
brigades.
These field days and reviews form the
mod pleasing and attracting public exhibi
tions of the country, collect the largest aflem
blies of citizens of both fexes,who by their
presence and approbation, animate the guar
dians of our liberties in the pursuit of thole
military accomplishments, which are the
surest fafeguard of the blessings of society.
Extrafl of a letter from Charleston, dated
the 24th instant.
" At this moment our commerce is at a
stand, owing to a momentary expectation
of receiving accounts from those in power
with you, that we are no longer at peace
with the Briti(h,againft whom the merchants
of this place, in consequence of the great
and unwarrantable depredation on their com
merce are much incensed."

FRANCE.
Pars, Dec. 31. Armand-Louis Goutaud,
ci-devant Duke de Biron, born April nth,
1747, married to Emilia Boufflers, February
4th, 1766, formerly General of the armies
of the Republic in Italy and in La Vendee,
has been executed, convicted of being an ac
complice in a conspiracy against the internal
and external fafety of the Republic.
The principal leaders of the infurreftion
at Lisle, now confined in the dliferent prisons
at Paris, are the Governor Vjlette, the lam:
who denounced General Lamorliere, who
has periflied on the fcaffold ; Dufraiile, Ge
neral of the Revolutionary Army, who so
late as the last year trod the Aageat BrufTelj;
Lis Adjutant-General Beauvofin ; Serdeaux,
aid-de-camp; and Capperon and Target, ge
nerals of brigade, and some others.
Yesterday being the day appointed for
the Civic Festival on the re-vaptiire of
Toulon, the Convention did not fit. The
ceremony, the order of which was arrang
ed by David the Painter, was urtiered in
by the firing of cannon. Fourteen chari
ots, with devices emblematic of the four
teen armies of France, and the figure of a
ihip, as the emblem of the navy, formed
the principal objedts in the procefiion; and
an occasional hymn was sung.

Aliquid semper ad conimunem utilitatem af

The Firjl American Edition.
THE grand principle of Eqnality, if right
ly tinderftood, is the only basis 011 which
universal justice, sacred order, and. peffeft
freedom, can be firmly built, and permanent
ly secured. The view of it exhibited in this
eflay, at the fame time that it reprefles tbc
insolence of office, the tyranny of pride, aid
the outrages of oppreflion ; confirms, in the
mod forcible manner, the necessity of fnbor
dination, and the just demands of lawful au
thority. So far indeed, from loofeniog the
bands of fbciety, tlrat it maintains inviolate,
every natural and every civil diftinftioti,
draws more closely every social tie, unites in
one harmonious and justly proportioned fyf
tem, and brings men together 011 the even
ground of the inherent rights of human na
ture, of reciprocal obligation, and of a com
mon relation to the community.
