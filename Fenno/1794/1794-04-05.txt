LEYDEN, Dec. 30.
An address has been presented to the
Convention by the Lyonefe, in which that
wretched people complain of the horrors
which the representatives commit daily in
that city, especially the emiilaries of the
Jacobins, the fev<;n monsters who compose
the ci-devant revolutionary commiilion.
, " Scarcely is judgment pronounced,
(fay the unhappy Lybnefe,) when those
who have been condemned are exposed in
a mass to the fire of cannon, loaded with
grape-ftiot; they fall one upon another,
struck with the thunder ; and often muti
lated, they have the misfortune not to be
killed by the firft difeharge. The victims
wbo yet breathe, after having fuffei ed that
p.unifhment, are finiihed by sabres or muf
quetry."
The representatives have substituted
for the two revolutionary tribunals which
tjiey,had created, a committee of seven
judges. ThiÂ» measure was indispensable.
The two tribunals, embarrafled by forms,
did not answer the wifties of the people :
Prisoners accumulated in the prisons : Par
tial executions had loft all effect upon the
Lyonefe. The committee of seven, judg
es in afummary manned; and its sentence
is as just as it is sudden.
On the 14th December 60 villains were
shot to death. On the ,15th, 208. On
the 17th, 60 were acquitted. On the
iÃ:h, 68 were shot, and 8 guillotined.
On the 19th, the holy and miraculous

BOURDEAUX, Dec. 20.
The milittry commission proceeds in a
revolutionary manner : The heads of con

and the moderate, the indifferent, and ego

arretted. It -was a Focus of Arijlocracyâ
we have destroyed it. On the evening
before; the theatre was surrounded, when
there were upwards of 2000 persons in
it ; and all fufpefted persons who were
reunited in great numbers, were impri

soon do them justice.

The observations of Mr. Smith oi South-
Carolina, on the palling of tilt bill for
the naval armament.
( Concludal.)
Mr. S. next reviewed the principal ob- !
jc&ions to the bill, he saidâx it. That j
the force contemplated was incompetent.
2d. That fending an armed force on the
ocean would be the means of involving us
in a war with some of the maritime pow
ers. 3. That we had no friendly ports in
Europe, which our frigates could resort
to for supplies or reritment. 4_th. That
the expence would exceed the object to be
protected. 5. That our trade would be
deprived of the ieamen required to man
the frigates. 6. That it was now so late
in the season we could not protect our ves
sels the ensuing summer, and that some
favorable events might occur before the
frigates could be equipped, which would
render them unnecessary. 7. That this
was the beginning of a naval establish
ment, which would hereafter involve this
country in iramenfe debts and maritime
wars.
1 ft. To the firit obje&ion Mr. Smith
replied that he was surprised those gentlemen
who deemed the nu<'.X/cr of frigates ina
dequate to the object had never proposed
to encreafe the quantum of force ; though
this objection had been re-echoed by seve
ral gentlemen, none of them had thought
proper to move an augmentation of th?
Itrength ; the only motion of that nature,
had proceeded from a quarter which had
been always friendly to the measure.
From the documents on the table, and
from the diligent enquiries of a^large
committee, the force contemplated by the
bill, did however, appear adequate ; the
number, and strength of the Algerine
corsairs had been pretty nearly ascertained:
it had been ilated from good authority,
that their vessels were (light, and that
they did not cruize in fleets, but feattered
for the purpose of plunder. It also ap
peared that a smaller force than ours, had
been fuccefsfully employed by Portugal,
in blocking up the Streights.
2d. The second objection arose, from
the danger of being involved in a war.
It had been said, that some of the mari
time powers, whose interest it was, that
our commerce (hould fuffer frprn thele
piratical depredations, would fee with
difpleafurc, our armed ve(Tels on the oce
an ; and would insult them ; that our of
ficers would resent such insults, and thus
draw us into a war. If there were any
nation so anxious to go to war with us,
as this objection supposed, they would be
at no loss for pretexts, without this ; if
while we were exercising so just, lawful
and necessary a right, as that of ufingthe
only means in our power, 01 protecting
our commerce from ruin, and our fellow
citizens, from a most dreadful captivity,
any nation (hould wickedly and wantonly
interfere, and moled our frigates, it would
(hew such a disposition to quarrel with us,
and be such an ast of hottility, as would
juftify war on our part. Whatever nation
it might be, he (hould view such an ag
greflion as the effect of predetermined
hostility, and (hould not hesitate a moment
to consider them as much our enemies, as
the Algerines themselves. But this arma
ment would furni(h so little pretence for
any danger of this kind, that he viewed
all such terrors as chimerical; indeed it
was somewhat strange, that these appre
hensions (hould have been suggested by
gentlemen, who considered commercial
reftriftions particularly directed at Great
Britain, as of a most pacific tendency.
If irritating measures, pointedly direc
ted at Great Britain, were not likely to
excite a hostile fplrit in l)er, much less
was it to be expected that measures of un
avoidable necessity, against the Algenn
piraies, would excite ibat fpir.t.
3 d. It had been clearly sheWn, that
there were many Convenient friendly poi ts,
to which our veflels of war, wottld haÂ»e
accels. Spain, Portugal and trance,
had been mentioned ; it was not probable,
we lhould be at war with all thole powers,
at the fame time. Being at peace with
them all, we had a right W expect a
friendly admission into their ports. A
state of war would undoubtedly, prelent
many difficulties, but even in that event,
the proposed measure, did not appear lels
indilpenfable.
4th. The expcnce had been strongly
urged, as a weighty objection. Mi.
Smith ohferved, that the laving in inf-.ir
anee, the value of our ships and cargoes,
the ran Com ot out captive seamen, was
more than an offset against this item.
But was not the slavery ot" our fellow-citi
zens, the national disgrace resulting from
it, to be taken into the account ? These
were in his mind, goufederations, beyond
all calculation. Who could, after read
ing the affecting narratives of Captain
| Penrofe and the other unfortunates, lit
< down contented with cold calculations,
! and dry syllogisms? These nairatives onght
j to e:;cite every possible exertion, not oniy
j to procure the release of the captured,
but to preveut an encreafe of the number
of these unhappy victims. This could
only be effedted by the proposed measure ;
it was the only practicable mode ot ob
taining a peace, which would ensure the
release of the captives, and of preventing
the capture of others. Were the expence
thereof double the sum proposed, he, for
one, would not hesitate to vote for it.
sth. It had been alledged, that depriving
our merchant vefiels of the fearpen requisite
to man the frigates, would be a serious inju
ry to oir trade. No further answer was
neceflary to this objection, than barely to re
mark, that the injury was not to be out in
competition with the less of teamen, by sla
very in Algiers, or by desertion from mer
chant ships, so unprotected and so exposed.
6th. The lateness of the season, had fur
niihed another objection. Mr. Smith asked,
whose fault it was, that this measure had not
been adopted sooner > The members whose
opinions coincided with his, and himfelt had
urged the necessity of it, near three months
ago, but the opposition it had
encountered, and the intervention arid dis
cussion of the commercial rtgnlations, nai
protracted it to the present period. Late as
it was, it was however highly neceflary, and
the best expedient which had been suggested.
The very circumftanee of preparation for
naval defence, would facilitate our pegocia
tion for peace, and would encourage our sea
men to remain in our service.
States.
He wiihed it always to be understood,
that he did not rely solely on the . kacy of
this armament; he it'll looked forward to
a negociation, and was ready to provide the
mod ample means for that purpoie, but he
-was at the fame time fatisiied, triat the tirft
measure mult accompany the latter, as the
one would be nugatory, without the other.
7th. The dangers refaitiag from a large
navy eftabiilhment, and the immense debts
they have created in other countries, had been
depicfted aÂ»d the House had been warned
against such evils. -How a bill, providing fix
frigates, which were to exist only during the
war with Algiers, could excite an yiprelien
fion of a large and permanent navy, and an
enormous debt, Mr. Smith said he ;was at a
loss to discover. The clause which autho
rized the President, in the event of a peace
with the Regency of Algiers, to discontinue
the armament, was a complete answer to all
reasoning which had been indulged on the
fubjeft of navies and debts. Adrafttting
there had been no such clause, he' did not
feel the weight or applicability of the reason
ing. This country was peculiarly fitted for
a navy; abounding in all kinds of naval
resources, wc had within ourselves those
means which other maritime nations were
obliged to obtain from abroad. The nature
of our situation, and the navigating difpofi
tiou of a considerable proportion of our citi
zens, evinced ft'ill more the propriety of some
naval establishment. Perhaps t+ie country was
not yet mature for such an eftabiilhrnent, to
any great extent, but he belt?ved the period
was not far distant when it would. Sweden,
with a population not greater than that of
the United States, and with more (lender re
sources, maintained a large navy ; he saw r.o
reason why the United States with an irrcrea

considerable national resources, might not

Having replied to the principal obieition*
ajjaiqft the bill, Mr. Smith said, though hedul
Hot any arguments of that day,
WQitld change a linglc vote, yet as a fa-mid
and lengthy cppjfition had h;-en made, he
wished to Qi"w, that he did not rely upcm a
majority, and that "he would never <jive his
alfent to a ineaiitre, -which did not in his
opinion, reft on the balls of good peltry airi
propriety. 1
He viewed this mcafure as retting on that
bails ; he trusted it would produce ths goud
effeiits which its Meads anticipated, and tha-.
as he was confident it would be supported by
a majority of that Houle, he had little dou'tf,
that k would be fin<Jiione<i by the approba -
tion of their constituents | but that even wefe
he periuaded it would be attended with iome
1 of the mifchiefs which its opponents had
predicted, he /hould still desm himfelf war
ranted, in supporting it as a thing irreiiftaj.-!/
and loudly called for by the urgency of ex

London, January 9, 1794-
My Dear Sir,
You will receive herewith the copy of
an inftru&ion to the commanders of big
Britannic Majesty's sHips of war, &c. da
ted the Bth of this month, concerning
which I had another cotiveHation this
morning with the rnitiiller of the foreign
department. On hw faying in the intro
duction of the fubjeit, that he hoped I
saw in it a manifeitatton of the good wilt
of thi'3 government towards the United
States ; I observed, that it was certainly
much left injurious to iwth;tn the inftruc
tioq which it revoked, and might be as
favorable as the principle upon which this
government acts would admit ; but I re
minded him that our idea* di&red materi
ally from theirs on this fabjeft, and with â¢
out repeating she arguments I had before
adJrelTed to him, both vsrfcatly and iiÂ»
writing in fuppoi tof our position, it was
only ncceflary to fay tost we did not ad
mit the right of the belligerent powers to
interfere farther in the commerce between
neutral nations and thsir adverforrc-s, than
to prevent their carrying to them articL'S
which by common usage weretilabJi(bed
as contraband, and any article* u) a place
fairly blockaded that cefiftqamtfy the
two firit articles, though founded upon
their principles of not {-iffmn-r in war-, a
traffic which was not admittai fey the fame
nations in the time of peace, zndoftukitff
their enemies property u'h>~is found 01.
V-, â¢f
board of neutral vessels, were nevertheless
contrary to what we contended to be the
iuft principles of the modern laws of na
tions ; that indeed I had some doubt ol
the fir ft article, being altogether support
ed by their own principle ; but fuppoiing
that article as well as the reft, to be con
sonant to their former usage, I wiihed to
know whether their present re-pubUcation,
imported afly thing more than was before
praftifed. Lord Grenville answered that
the only reason for renewing them was,
left the present instruction being a revoca
tion of that of the 6th of November,
mio-ht also be deemed to revoke these arti
cles which were connected with it. His,
lord-hip then explained the motives which
bad induced this government to lihie : the
prelent inttruftion. The hrft, he laid,
was the fineere desire of admi.uftration, to
maintain the best undemanding and har
mony with the United States; the second
was, what he could not mention to me of
ficially, but what he still thought it right
I (hould be apprised of, that no miscon
ception of, their motives might be enter
tained, that he was aware of the delicacy
ef speaking to a foreign minister concern
ing the internal ftatc of his country, nei
ther could he expect an answer from me
on the fubjeft, but that their fecontFrea
fon was by their conduct, to take away
*very pretext from evil disposed persons
among us, \Vho, according to the intelli
gence he had received, Were endeavoring
to irritate our people against Gieat Bri
tain, as well as to oppose the measures of
*oifr own government, and in short, to re
duce us to the present situation of France,
a misfortune which they deprecated as well
for our fakes as for the common welfare
and tranquility of mankind. He further
rook occafron to observe with refpeft to
the conduct of our government in main
taining our neutrality, that although there
were some matters with which this go
vernment was not perfectly fatisfied (and
to w'hich for the fame reason they refrained
torn giving that opposition they thought
rhey would be jufliiied in doing) yet from
the general tenor of the conduct of our
government, they were convinced it was
their desire to maintain a fair neutrality,
which was an additional motive for their
present conduct.
I of Course said nothing of our inter
03d.affairs -nor of tfioic of Fiance.' i as
sured him however that our government
had been perfectly fine ere in every mea
fijre relating to our neutrality ; that they
adopted it from a conviction that it was
both just and politic and had pursued it
according to what s they conceived to be
ju!t principles, knowing that such conduct
could entitle 11s to the benefits to be deri
ved from a neutral situation. I concluded
by a/king what explanation could be given
to what was passed in this business ; and
of the effect of the inftruttionof tba 6th
of May upon such vessels as might
during the two months it had been in
force have fallen into the hands of their
enemies ? Lord Grenville answered, that
the order of the 6th of Nov. was intend
ed to be temporary and calculated to an
swer two purpefes, one was to prevent
the abuses which might take place in con
sequence of the whole of the St. Domin
go fl.et having gone to the United States;
the other was on account of the attack
defrgned npon the French Weft India
Islands by the armament under Sir John
jervis and Sir Charles Grey ; but that it
was now no longer neceftary to continue
that regulation for those purposes. He
added, that the inftru&ion of the 6th
Nov. only authorized the vessels to be
brought in for legal adjudication, and up
on being told that notwithstanding such
were the terms made use of yet that the
officers who would have" to act under it,
mull conceive it to extend to condemna
tion because otherwise the order was un
fteceffary, as without it they had been au
thorized to bring tp adjudication all such
veilels as they previously deemed liable to
condemnation : He replied that the cafe
of every vessel must be decided by its own
merits, but that he conceived no vessel
would be condemned under that inftruc
tionwhieh wouldnot have been previously
liable to the iame sentence. I informed
Lord Grenville, that I should communi
cate this instrument to you by the packet:
He said he should likewise forward it by
the fame conveyance, and at the fame
time would fend an answer to my memo
rial on the King's inftrudtion of the Bth
ef June to be commuuicated to ycu by
Mr. Hammond.
I remain with sincere refpefl, dear fir,
joitr faithful and obedient servant,
Thomas Pinckney.

SALEM, March 25.
Last week Mr. Samuel Cabot, of Be
verly, arrived from Bourdeaux, by way of
Tobago. He failed, by permiifion, on
the 28th Dec. The embargo was then
continued ; and the National commiflion
ers could give no encouragement of- its
being speedily taken off. It is supposed
that Bourdeaux, would long since have
been given up like Toulon, had the mha
: bitants had the fame opportunity. Their
dipofition being well known, they are
watched by the National Comiuiffioners'
with the utmost Itrichiefs ; and the decrees
of the Convention are executed with un
exampled rigor. All "foreigners at that
place,(except of neutral nations)and many
French, have been confined in prison.
Numbers have been condemned to the
guillotine, by the Revolutionary Tribunal;
and the executions take place immediately
on sentence being palled, whether by day
orfcy night. Vad property isconfifcated.
The rich are obje&s of suspicion. All
plate and specie is demanded in exchange
for affignats, which were at par in that
place. Bread was scarce : and the inha
bitants, rich or poor, on an equal allowance
of half a pound a day. Ihe churches weie
deltroyed, or converted to other and
the bells cad into cannon. Reason and
truth were worlhipped, in the 1 emple of
Liberty. The Sans Culottes were in
high spirits. The men who were between
18 & 25 years of age had been called fois,
and marched sometime ill November, it
was fnid that several thousand Prussians
had deserted to the French, in one body.
Mr. Cabot faw-a company of 69 of tlrem,
which were sent to Bourdeaux. Ameri
cans were treated with much re/pest in
France, and the French "have no desire
that we should be engaged in the war.
PHILADELPHIA,
APRIL 5.
A London paper of January the 6th fays,
There is no truth i* the report of Adthiral
Kingfmill having taken a French ihip, as
stated in our paper of Saturday Evening, in
consequence of erroneous information receiv
ed from Ireland by the Mail of that morn
ing. This report probably originated from
the Argonaut, one of the ships taken from
the French by Admiral Rodney, on the i?,th
of April, and then called the Jason, being
now part of admiral Kingfmill's squadron.
Extract of a letter from the Captain of an
American vefft-1, lately carried into Do
minica.
" We are in very great didrefs, occa
fiorjed by our detention, and the perishing
condition of our cargoes from the heat of
this climateâbut above all a violent sick
ness rages in our little fleet, â id Jo frequent
are the deaths, that our mourning flags
are constantly hoisted* and as all the mo
ney found on board when captured, is tak
en away, we are thereby rendered incapa
ble of procuring that medical and other
aflidance for our sick brethren, which hu
manity didlates they (hould have. We
yellerday handed in a petition to the. go
vernor, setting forth the deplorable fttua
: tion we are in with regard to the sick :
He has given us his word that he will in

: he will do, conlidering that the health of
the inhabitants very much depends upon

It is wholly unnecessary to expatiate on the
advantage,to American readers, that this edi
tion possesses, over every imported edition of
any system of Geography extant. The addit
tion of maps of the several state , procured a
a very great espenfe, and from the best ma
terials that are attaiuable, speaks such full
conviction on this fubjeft, that it would be
difrefpoft to the reader's understanding to
suppose it requisite to enter into a detail of
arguments to prove its superiority. In no
limilar work have such maps beenever intro
duced.
The emendations and additions which are
made in this work,are innumerable, and occuj
in every page. The public are referred to
the preface for a flight flcetch of a few oi
them.
The publisher takes the present oppo'tu
nity of returning his most lincere thanks to
tnofe refp &able characters who have favored
him with documents for improving the maps
of several of the states. -He requests a conti
nu3nce of their kiudnefsÂ» and hopes that such
public spirited citizens, as are polfeifed of si
milar documents, will favor him with their
affiihmce in perfecting his undertaking.
The extraordinary encouragement with
which he has been favored, has excited
in-hit breast the warmest featiraents of grati
tudeâsentiments which time vyill not efface.
He pledges himfelf to the citizens of the
United States, to fp*re neither pains nor ex
penfe to render the present edition of Guthrie s
Geography hnproved, deierving of their pa
tronage. waftf

The Public are cautioned to ,
beware rf counterfeited Five Dollar Bills of
the Bank of the "United States, and Twenty
Dollar Bills of the Bank of North America,
fe-veral of which hwue appeared in circulation
within a few days past ; they are a good ge
neral imitation of the genuine Bills, hut may
be diOinguifhed by the following
marks.
Five Dollar Bills of the Bank of the
United States.
ALL that have appeared liavs the letter F.
for their Alphabetical Mark.
The Texture of the Paper is thicker and
whiter and it takes the ink more freely than
the genuine paper.
The O. in the word Company is smaller
than the M. and other letters of that word,
fÂ® that a line extended from the top of the O,
to touch the top of the M would extend con
fulsiably above the range of the whole word.
lu the word United the letters are narrow*
erand closer together than the reft of the bill
The i and /in the word promise are not
parallel, the /inclining much more forward
than the Â«
The engraving is badly executed,the strokes
(if al] the Letters are stronger and the devi e
ill the margin particularly ismuch coarser and
appears darker than in the true bills. Some i
of the counterfeits bear date in 1791â Where
as the Bank was not in operation till Decem
ber, and no five dollar bills were issued in
that year.
Dollar Bills of the Bank of North
America.
ALL that have appeared have the letter
B. for their alphabetical mark.
They are printed on a paper nearly similar
to that of the counterfeit Five Dollm Notes
above described ; the engraving is bettei exe
cuted, and they approach neaTer to the ap
pearance of the genuine bills.
The fine ruled lines through the word Twtn
ty, in the body of the bill, are in number thir
teen in the genuine b 1 lis, and but twelve in
the counterfeits.
The word Company is much like the fame
word in the Five Dollar Blls is defer ibed a
bove, the 0 being less than then, and ethers
following.
There is no stroke to the / in the word North
whereas in the genuine bills the ftrojee is well
defined.
The letters ent in the word Tvunt), to the .
left hand at the bottom, do not come down to
the line, but are so cut as to give an irregular
appearance to the word, the Tui and '.he j go
ing below them.
The Signature J Nixon, t>as the appear
ance of beiog written with lamp-black and
goil, and differs from, the other inks used in
printing the bills and the cafhiei's lignature.
It is fupuofed these forgeries were committed
in some ot the Southern States, as all the coun
terfeits thai have appeared, have come Irom
ihpnr * twn jÂ»i "ipHf"l I'htniL . -4B
ed in Virginia, on fufptcion of being the authors
of them.

of them, viz.
