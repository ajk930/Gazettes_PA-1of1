''PHE undernamed committee, appointed Lv
1 " THE SOCIETY for the INSTITU

SUNDAY SCHOOLS in the city of Philadel
phia and the diitiift of Southwaik and the
Northern Libtrties," to solicit fuuher fubferip

(aid society have cftabiithed, take the liberty to
rcprefent to their fellow citizen*â
That, although the fehool? were fufperided
during the period of the late avrlul calamity
with which our city and fubtiibs have been af
flifled, they aie now again opened ior the lice
admillion and education of poor children.
That, the necilfity and rcaTons for the eflab
lifhment of thefc schools arc htcre;ifed, from ibe
Circumftauce of the late distress having left a
number of Orphans deilitute of all the means
of education, favc what the hand of bcnevolencc
may adminiiler.
7'hat, former < xoerience has, mod pleafmglv,
verified the fondeft hopes ot the friends of this
inilitution, with regard to the piogrefs and ad
vancement of the children, who havÂ« heretofore
been under its care, in the ufeful branches of
education which it has afforded. Referring to
this faÂ£t, and to the address to the public, on
this fubjeft, publilhed in the newspapers of this
city in the third month lall, when about eight
hundred and twenty children of both sexes had
partaken of the benefits afforded by the society,
and about three hundred and twenty more were
th-n a&ually receiving inftiufliou in their
schools, it now onlv icmains to be observed,
that the funds of the society are greatly infufli
cient to carry on their benevolent drfigns, and
that the committee formerly appointed to solicit
fubferiptions, conceived it necelTary to decline
their applications to their fellow-citizens for
their assistance in favor of thefc fchdbls, in order
that thtic might be co inierrupiic/n from rhem
to the folicitatioDs then made in hehalf ol their
unfortunate brethren from Cape-Francois.
The public aid is now therefore earncflly fo
liated to support a charitable eftablilhment, cal
culated upon the principles of public and pri
vate good. The annual fubfeription for a mem
ber is but One Dollar ; and it is presumed that
so fnidll a sum per annum cannot be better dik
posed of, by those who can afloid it, than by
belfoWfng it as the price of the diffufion of ufctitl

INSTRUCTIONS
From the Conflituted Authorities of France,
To CITIZEN GENET,
Minijler of the French Republic ,to the United
States of North-America,
[concluded.]
Extract from a supplement to the infli
given to citizen Genet, minijlcr plenipoten
tiary of the French republic to the United
States of America.
THE Executive Council wilh that a
new treaty, founded upon a baiis more li
beral and more fraternal than that of 1778,
may be concluded as soon as poliib'e. As,
however, they cannot conceal that iu the
actual state of Europe a negociation of
this kind may be subject to many impedi
ments, whether brought about by secret
manoeuvres of the English minister and hii
partizans at Philadelphia, by the timidity
cf certain members of the federal govern
ment, who notwithstanding their own pa
triotism have always (hewn the Itrongeft
aversion to every measure which might be
uilpleafing to England, they think it right,
for the present, that citizen Genet (hould
draw every advantage which the provilions
of the fubhlling treaty fepure to the re
public, until a new compact has more clear
ly and fully defined and enlarged them.
In this view, which exiiling circum
stances render particularly important, Ci
tizen Genet is exprefslv enjoined to make
himfelf thoroughly miifterof the sense cf
the treaty of 1778, and to be watchful
in the execution of the articles which are
favorable to the commerce and navigation
of the French republic, and he will en
deavor to fatisfy the Americans, that the
engagements which may appear burthen
fome to them are the just price of that In
dependence which the French nation con
tributed to acquire for them.
In the probable cafe of a maritime war
Citizen, Genet will employ all the means
in Ills power to procure a-itligious obferâ
vancc of the 17th, 21ft, and 22d aiti
des of the treaty of commerce, by which
the contra&ing parties engage Freely to ad
mit the prizes made by either oF the par-
ties from its enemies, and have renounced
the right of permitting their citizens to
serve under the flag of a foreigner against
theveflels of theirrefpeftivenations,or even
to admit into their ports the prizes of fo
reigners, or permit the arming or fapply
ing foreign privateers.
These articles are the more important
in the now situation, as the great dillauce
of the English privateers from their ports,
and the difficulty of supplying them, will
render their cruizers the more expensive,
and the return and sale of their prizes the
more precarious ; while our vefiels, avail
ing themselves of their right, will have at
their disposal all the ports of the United
States and the provisions with which they
abound. It would be moreover to be
feared that the fitting out in American
ports English armaments, or such as were
pretended to be so, would induce a num
ber of individuals of the northern states,
remarkable for theii boldness and activity,
to accept of English commissions and dis
tress and injure our commerce. Without
doubt neither the Congress or the Execu
tive powerof the United States would ap
prove a conduct so little conformable to
the ties of friendfhip and good understand
ing which fubfills between the two nati
ons ; but the great extent of the Englilh
commerce in America now become free,
the prodigious number of its factors and
of the emiflaries of George the 111. the
means of corruption, which their situation
and their local acquaintance give them,
would render these expeditions the more
j frequent as it would be so easy to deceive
the vigilance of government by concealed
equipments. Citizen Genet is therefore
particularly enjoined to watch, by the
consuls and commercial agents, the con
duct of the Englilh in the different ports,
to insist rigorously upon the execution of
the 17th, 21 ft, and 2id articles of the
treaty of 1778, and to prevent in the A-
RTI S E
[Whole No. 479.]
merican ports all equipments, unless upon
account of the French nation and the ad
mission of any prize except those which
Ml have been made by the veflels of the
republic. He will take to explain himfelf
npon this object with the dignity and e
nergy of the representative of a great peo
ple, who in faithfully fulfilling their en
gagements know how to make their rights
F.ions
refpe&ed
As focm as circumstances permit effica
cious negociations concerning a new trea
ty of commerce, Citizen Genet will not
lose fight of llipulating pofitivelv and
without refefve for a reciprocal exemption
from the duty on tonnage, avoided, under
different pretences, for many years pad by
the American government, tho' expressly
granted by the 6th article of the present
treaty
The mutual naturalization of French
and American citizens in commercial ref
peÂ£ts, proposed by Mr. Jefferfon and ap
proved of by the Executive Council, will
render this exemption from the duty on
tonnage less offenlive for the powers claim
ing a participation of the fame favor by
virtue of their treaties, for the cafus fe
deris will be entirely changed with refpeft
to them,
The reciprocal guarantee of the two na
tions stipulated in the i ith article of the
treaty of 1778. can be eftablilhed upon
generous principles which have been al
ready pointed out, and shall equally be an
elfential clause in the new treaty which
will be proposed. The Executive Coun
cil in confequcncc recommendefpecially to
citizenGenettofound early the disposition
of the American government&to make it a
condition, J; Hi qua nou, of their free com
merce with the Weft-Indies so elfential to
the United States. It nearly concerns
the peace and prosperity of the French na
tion, that a people, whose resources en
creafe beyond all calculation and whom
nature hath placed so near our rich colo
nies, should become interested, by their 4
own engagements, in the preservation of
these islands. Citizen Genet will find the
less difficulty in making this proposition
reiilhec in the United States, as the great
trade which will be the reward of it will
indemnify them ultimately for the facrifices
which they may iiiake at the cr.tfet, and
the Americans cannot be ignorant of the
great (iilproportion between their resour
ces andthofe of the French republic, and
that for S very long period the guaran
tee allied of them will be little else than
nominal for them, while that on our part
will be real and we (hall immediately put
ourlelves in a state to fulfil it, in fending to
the American ports a fufficicnt force to put
them beyond insult and to facilitate their
communication with the islands and with
France. Fully to insure the success of
these negotiations and to render nugatory
in the United States those scandalous inli
nuatior.s so clrj-.deftinely spread through
Europe by the enemies of the republic,
the Executive Council specially direct Ci
tizen Genet to adhere to the forms estab
lished for official communications with the
United States, between the government
and foreign agents, and not to permit
himfclf to take any step, or make any
overture, which can give umbrage to the
Americans in regard to the constitution
which they have chosen, and which differs
in many ponits from the principles eftab
lilhed in France.
The emissaries and partizans of George
111, the emigrants, and the Hilpaniola re
fugees, who are found in great numbers
in the principal cities of the United
States, ar.d who have already infe&ed
them with their falfehonds, will not fail to
watch the minister of the republic and to
give all his measures the molt malicious
conftruftion. An open and patriotic con
duct can alone put him beyond the reach
of calumny and mifconftru&ion. The
Executive Council relies in this respect
with an entire confidence upon the pru
dence and known ifioderatLn of Citizen
Genet.
R.In order that nothing may Jelay the
conclusion of the negociations of citizen
Genet with tile Americans, and that he
may have in his own power all the meanÃ
which can aflift the pains he will take in
thecaufeof liberty, the Executive Coun
iil has given him the full power? annexed.
The muiiiter of the marine department
will trairtrrat to him a certain number of
blank letters of marque, which he will de
liver to fucli French or American owners
as (hail apply for the fame.
The miaifter at war (hall likewise deli
ver to citizen Genet officers' commissions
in blank for several grades in the army.
Done and agreed upon in Executive
Council the Seventeenth day of January,
of the year 1793, and of the French Re
public the fecund.

not to hasten you in communicating it to
all those, who knowing the law of 13th

Mr. Fenno,
As the following cxtraft from a Connecti
cut paper contains the essence of the ar
guments which have been advanced in
support of (he opinion, that the liber
ties of the United States, will stand or
fall with the success or failure of the pre
sent Revolution of France, you are re
quested to republifh it.
ARE NOT OUR LIBERTIES
AT STAKE? Did not the British Mi
nister publicly declare, that it was not
the French nation, but the REPUBLI
CAN PRINCIPLES which they had
adopted that he withed to exterminate,
and to effect this he waged war? Has he
then waged war against the French nation
only ? Is it not likevvife against us ? Are
not their principles our principles, conse
quently their cause is ourcaufe, which we
trust is the cause of right reason ; which
ought to be the cause of all men ; and
which is the cause of God, against which
the kings and princes of Europe Gog and
Magog are gathered together. Is it not
then our immediate inteieft that this cause
should be supported ? And if so, is it not
our immediate and indifpenfible duty to
make use of the means that God has put
in our hands to effed it. Although Ame
rica is yet in a state of infancy, and her
resources fmaU when compared to those of
the nations at war, yet in a good cause
(he can do much, and even without enter
ing into a war, (he can withhold her com
merce, which enables Britain to carry on
the war against us. For I take it for
granted that thewar is dire&ly against us;
and that in a most pointed and dangerous
manner, although we seem not to be sen
sible of it. For it is against those PRINCI
PLES without which we cease to be a
nation. And if France should be conquer
ed, we have no reason to believe we should
not be attacked. For the present wai is
a war of despotism against freedom, and
as these two principles are diametrically
opposite to each other, no peace can be
expe&ed, until one or the other is exter
minated. But perhaps you fay, we fear
that withholding our commerce will be
the means of a war ; and you dread the
consequences of it. So do I, but I dread j
what may likely be the consequence of re
maining neuter worse, for I dread slavery;
but I cannot believe that withholding our
commerce will be the means of plunging
us in a war. If it should, JUSTICE will
be on onr fide, for we should be doing as
we ought to do in a national way, and to
do otherwifc, would be a national evil;
and is it not common for national fins to
be puniflied with national calamities ? And
is war, think you, the only calamity a na
tion has to fear ? It may be that the devot
ed inhabitants of Philadelphia thought the
fame ; but how were they deceived ?
There was a time when the Israelites were
opprefled by their enemies ; it was God's
will that they should be relieved by means
of war ; and the people were called upon
to go against their enemies, and as it was
a common cause, they ought all to have
been willing to go. But the inhabitants
of Meroz, probably fearing the calamities
of a war, went not; and although those
that went obtained a victory, and deliver
ed Israel, yet the inhabitants of Meroz,

for their sluggish neutrality, were cursed
with a bitter curse.
For the Gazette of tlx United States.
GRATITUDE to FRANCE. This
has been the text for the Bolton Chronicle
writers and other incendiarics to preach
against the proclamation of neutrality and
the writers who appeared to vindicate it
Our Legislative and corporate bodies have
truly exprefTed the feme of the people on
this fubjedt, by approving the conduct of
the Preiident. The war party, however,
would not allow the merit of the noble
firtnnefs of the chief magistrate in keeping
our country clear from the war. Citizen
Genet has published his instructions to
clear himfelf, and thereby leaves his tools
in the lurch. Those inftrudiions, page 2d,
tell us that the conduct of the old govern
ment of France towards America, was the
proper hibject of indignation not gratitude.
The fame inftrudlions inform us of the
proper measure of thanks due to the nezu
government for the very kind intentions
they entertain towards the United States.
Citizen Genet, rejeSing the myjlerious
secrecy of courts, and full of candor and
franinefs (fee his letter to Mr. Jefferfon
of 20th December 1793) on his firft arri
val at Philadelphia, gave public assurances
of his being a minister of peace : he did
not expect the United States would take
part in the warâit was not defiredkby
France, that they fliould behold citizen
candor and franinefs, with peace in his
mouth, and the war inftru&ions in his
pocket.
He had in his pocket, three hundred
commiflions to dijlribute to the Americans,
to try their chance againjl (that is to rob)
the English, Dutch, RuJJians, Prujfians and
AujlriamâSee page 7th âWe were to
make common cause with the Frenchâto
punijh the invading powers, and to be pro
tected by a fujjicicnt force, to put our ports
beyond insult.
Benefits in trade were also to be held
out as a lure to join FranceâA (hare of
the Weft India trade, which at present is
not worth a pin to herfelf, was to be 011
the condition fine qua non that the United
States would now aiTure and guarantee
the Islands to France, (fee page 6) Regu
lations of trade are also recommended It
is plain to the most careless observer, why
they are timed as they areâand what is
their tendency ? It is a truck trade that is
proposed: a bubble in their Weft India
commerce at a future day, to engage us
in war and ruin now. When they had any
thing to give us, they denied it, now they
have it not, they would barter it for war.
As long as it was pofTible, and longer
than it was decent, our faition juftified
GenetâAt lalt they gave him up, when
they found he hung heavy on their cause,
but could not help it. Then their cant
wasâthe man is ralh and imprudent: those
who sent him are wife, jutl and friendly.
We renounce the ministerâwe cling with
ten fold fondnefs to his mastersâBehold
his inftruftionsâThey tell us, and so does
the proverb, like manâlike matter.

PHILADELPHIA,
JANUARY 6.
A letter from Baltimore informs that
the gallant Capt. Barney, on his paflage
from Port-au-Prince with a very valuable
cargo has been captured by a British fri
gate. Particulars in our next.
This morning about 8 o'clock, a fire
brokÂ« out in lome back buildings on the
South fide of Saflafras, near Second-street.
By the usual, alert and spirited exertions
of the Citizens, the progress of the flames
was arretted, but not till some confidcrable
damage was sustained.
From the General Advertiser of this
morningâlt is not to be wondered at, a
correspondent observes ; that Mr. Jeffer
fon Ihould resign. The nature of the of
fice he filled required of him to lend his
name to mcafurei which militated against
his well known principles. As Secretary
of State he was chargcd with certain ccr
refpondences founded oh principles firft
fettled in the Executive's council, where
his influence was but trifling. To a man
of his way of thinking and turn of mind
it must have been a disagreeable taflc to
give the fan&ion of his name to fentimcnts
which his heart must difapprovc.
In moil of the European countries
there are certain focicties who stroll about"
from town to town, and wherever they can
pick up a dray child they educate him to
their own principle?, and add him to the
company. A similar institution we hear
has lately been attempted to be formed in
America.âThe lad place where these
American Gjrjjfiei were feefl, was Cliatle'
town.:âRut luckily for the worthy inha
bitants of that town, we uuderiianj that
none Of their children were kidnapped by
the wandering crew : & we recommend to
the inhabitants of the other towns to be
upon their guard, and to keep their chil
dren out of the way of the American
Strolling Gypsies.

VOLUME X. OF
Encyclopedia ; or Dictionary
Of A ts, Sciences, and MUceiiancous
on a Plan entirely new ;
The Different Sciences and Arts,
are digejled into the form of
Diftindl Treaties or Syfteins :
THIS volume contains principles of Leve l';,
Liberty, D.r&rine of Ligftc, Lightning,
Locks, Logarithms, Logic, History of Lon
don, Luther, Lydia, Macedon,
Madagascar, Magic, Magnetjfui, Males, His
tory of Man, Marriage, Mary, Maryland,
Masonry, Materia Medica, Meadow, Mecha
nic, with :* great variety of Biographical and
MifceManeous articles, iilhitrated with Twen
ty two Copperplates.
As a number of families are still in the
country, and it is not generally known who
arereturned. T. solicits the favor
ot* the fubfer'bers to call or fend for their vo
lumes, that they may be supplied as early as
poflible.
The tenth volum kof the Encyclopedia is
now presented to Ihe public ; but as it makes
its appearance in an imperfect state, some ac
count of the reason of that imperfediou fliouid
be >iven. On the Bth of September last, the
Publiiher had the misfortune of having his
Printing-office burnt down by a fire which
broke out in the neighbourhood, and a great
quantity of his printing materials deflroyed,
and among other articles, the figures, with
which he was printing the tables of lo
garithms, belonging to the present volume,
were melted down by the violence ot the tire.
As a supply of these could not be immediately
obtained, he was under the neceflity of pub
lifhing the volume without these tables; but
hopes he shall be able to publish them with the
next volume which is now in considerable for-
end2\v.
t&frf.
wardnefs.
The Publisher embraces this opportunity of
expressing his grateful acknowledgments t#
the generous public, for the very liberal pa
tronage with which his undertaking has been
honored; at the fame time he takes the li
berty of representing to such ol the
as are in arrears, the indifpenfible necelTity of
punctuality, both in taking up the volumes as
early a? poflible after publication, and of pay
ing for them when taken. Many of the lub
fcribers having got only one, two, three,
volumes, and i'everal volumes remain unpaid-
Thus the work hangs in all its different ft age t
from the commencement; and though the im
portance of a few dollars may be but a trifle
to the individuals, yet the accumulation of
these trifles unpaid lays the Publiftier under
very serious efihbarraffluent,and deprives him
of the use of many Thousands of Dollars whiefc
at this time would be of very eflential service.
For tlaefe reasons the Publilher finds himfelt
under the neceflitjr of recurring to the original
terms of publication, and in future no vo
lpmes will be delivered but only to those who
take and pay to the time ot publication.
