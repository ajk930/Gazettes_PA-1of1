Philosophical Lectures,
By J. M. RA Y.
FROM Edinburgh, lately from Paris,
teacher of Hebrew, &c. languages, au
thor ot'Comprehenfive View of Philosophical,
Political, and Theological Systems, from the
creation of the world to the present time, &rc.
He will begin this second course of Ledlures
February 27th, at 6 o'clock in the evening, in
the Friends' grammar school room, 4tk street,
and will finifh it in a month.âThe idea of i\
was fuggeftcd by some Ladies for the improve
ment of the sexâbut it is for both
lexej (of any age above whereby
they will discover a new world in natuie,
concealed from others as a fine country is
from travellers in tht night, and as the light,
and the appearance of nature is from the
blind ; this will be a new scene of enjoyment
and delight, as that of feeing is to one born
blind, and will teach them to acquire the pro
per use of their faculties, as a child does that
of his limbs by learning to walk this will
elevate them to a Philosophical region of sub
lime enjoyments and rational pleasures, as
much superior to the pleasures and amuse
ments of others as a man is to a child in fla
ture, and which will endure the lhock of aJ
verfity, and not forfake them like others, in
affliction and old age ; as the use and end of
all real knowledge k practice and happiness,
this course will tend to promote personal hap
piness, and fit for the duties of society, one
part of it will be on the prefer vation of health
of body and serenity of mind, without which
riches can afford no enjoyment : those whoob
ferved the author's regimen,efcaped the Pesti
lential disease in the house were others died
of it. To begin with an introductory Lec

In the Supreme CoukT of the Usi-r^
Alexander S. Glass, tsf Appeal from the
Others, appellants, j Circuit court
versus ! for the Dif.
The sloop Betsey and car- s trict of Ma
go, and Pierre Arcade J ryland.
Johaniiene appellee. J
3taw6w
AT a supreme Court of the United
States held at Philadelphia, (the
fame being the present feat of the Nation
al Government,) on Saturday the Bth
day of February in the year of our Lord
one thousand seven hundred aud ninety
four, before the Honorable John Jay,
Esq. Chief Justice, and the Honorable
William Cufliing, James Wilson, John
Blair, and William Paterfon, Efquirej,
AfTociate Justices of the said Supreme
Court, came the parties, as well appel*
lants, as appellee, in the above appeal by
their refpettive advocates ; and after fu!>
hearing of all and Angular, the ma'' tera
and things set forth, and contaiue j; n t j, e
record and minutes of the proceedings, aJ
well of the Circuit Court, f or the Mary
land Diftria, as of t 'h e Diftria Court
; or D# nek in said appeal, and so
lemn argupr ient Q f advocates, be
ing hi"i thereon : the said Supreme Court
<â Â» \he United States,(fitting and adjourn
ing from day to day) until the twelfth
day of February instant, took the fame
into consideration, and held the fame un
der advisement until the eighteenth day of
February aforefaid.
mw&ftf
At which day the said Court being met
and the advocates aforefaid attending, the
Court proceeded to the publication of their
final sentence or decree, which being read
and filed, is in the words following, to
wit:
This Court being decidedly of opinion
that every Diftria Court in the United
States poflefs all the powers of a Court of
Admiralty, whether considered as an in
stance or as a prize court, and that the plea
of the aforefaid apellce, Pierre Arcade
Johannene to the jurifdiaion of the Dif
tria Court, for the diaria of Maryland,
is altogether inefficient. It is therefore
considered by the Supreme Court afore
faid, and now finally adjudged and de
creed by the fame, that the bid plea be,
and it is hereby over-ruled and difmifled,
and that the decree of the said Diftria
Court of Maryland, founded thereon, be
and the fame is hereby revoked, reversed
and annulled.
And the said Supreme Court, being
further clearly of opinion that the Dif
tria Court of Maryland aforefaid, has
jurifdiaion competent, to enquire and to
decide whether in the prcfent cafe restitu
tion ought to be made to the claimants or
either of them, in whole or in part, that
is, whether such restitution can be made
consistently with the laws of nations, and
the treaties and laws of the United States;
therefore it is ordered and adjudged that
the said Diftria Court of Maryland, do
proceed to determine upon the libel of
the said Alexander S. Glass, and others,
agreeably to law and right, the said plea
to the jurifdiaion of the said Court to
the contrary notwithstanding.
And the said Supreme Court being
further of opinion that no foreign power
can of right, institute or erea any Court
of Judicature, of any kind, within the
Jurifdiaion of the United Slates, but
such only as may be warranted by, and
be in pursuance of treatiesâit is there
fore decreed and adjudged, that the Ad
mirelty Jurifdiaion which has been exer
cised in the United States by the Con
sulÂ» of France, not being so warranted ;
is not of right.
It is further ordered by the said Su
preme Court, that this cause be, and it
hereby is remanded to the Diftria Court
for the Maryland Diftria for a final decj
tD States,fion, and tTnit the fevera! p?.rti-g to tike
fame, do each pay their own coits.

Ch~.uir.ct has denounced Madame Mon
tsnfier, in the council general of the cCm
mtme; for having b'jP.t her theatre near
the National Library, in order to fct fire
to the latter. For this purpose she had
teen supplied. with Englifn money, and
50,000 crowns by the late queen.
The council c. dcrtd this th -nrc to be

On the ioth the council general re
folvcil, That, confidefing the great ex
pence of guarding the prisoners in the
I Â«s<viple, the convention ihould be petiti
i&cd to transfer the prisoners to the t>rdi
ary prisons, and bring them to trial with-

Culli, the deputy under sentence of

For some clays great uneafinels have
been felt for the town of Dol, which was
menaced by the royalists.. The rumour
is now confirmed, that the inhabitants of
Doi have been obligled to open their
gates to the rebels, after the lols of many
brave republicans.
It has been Itrongly rumoured r or some
days putt, that an attempt was intended
to be mace to rifcue the number of un
haQpy persons in the different prisons. In
consequence of this report, Henriot, the
Commandant, yefterdny ordered the fol
lowing declaration to fcrts polled up in every
ftrcet:
" I beseech my comrades to use their
utmost vigilance round the prisons of la
Force and la Conctergerie. There cxifts
a very hideous plot, the consequences of
which mult be extremely disadvantageous
to society, if we do not prevent it. Let
us watch these asylums; examiae those
who enter and go out:âthe gold of Ty
rants paflts through every crevice, and
causes more ravages than whole armies of
Despots."
The day before yesterday, the persons
lately employed in the theatre of Montan
fier, rcprefented to the council general of
the commune, that by (hutting up the
theatre, they were deprived of bread,that
they wei'e ifu?ft of them fathers of fami
lies, arid ready individually, to bring tes
timony that they were good republicans,
and that if the danger of setting fire to
the national library was the only obje&iorf
to fufiering them to perform precautions
might be taken to prevent such an acci
dent.
They were allowed to open the theatre
provifionally,under the dire&ion of a com
mittee of their own body, but not to ex
hibit any thing in the nature of fireworks.
It was also ordered that the watchmen
and firemen, in attendance at the theatre
should be doubled.
On the fame day, a member of the
council announced, that in the house of
Choubert, formerly receivcr-general of the
finances, and in other houses in the sec
tion of Indivifibiiity, he had found 375
marks of gold in ingots, 269 marks of
silver in ingots, 621 marks of silver in
plate, and 1,130,000 livres in coin,which
had been all carried to the mint.
The revolutionary tribunal bas acquit
ted Michonis, and 8 other perfons,charg
ed with having aided the late queen in a
confpiracv against the republic; but proofs
having appeared, that Michonis was aid
ing in the conspiracy, although it could
not be proved that he was wilfully and
knowingly aiding, he was ordered to be
detained as a fufpedled person till peace*
The number of prisoners, by the last
report, is 3,3 15.
From Toulon, we hear, that Spanifli
pride and Englilh bluntnefs, have produc
ed a quarrel; that each party diftrulls
the other, and both the French traitors
who put them in pofleffion of the port.
With vefpeft to the fafety of the repub
lic, we enjoy the molt tranquil confidence
âIn every quarter, we have baffled both
oirr external and internal enemies; inmany
we have been victorious. Ourtreafury is
in such a state of wealth as the world ne

and the security for them is immense. Be
frd"S the gold and silver brought from e

800,000 youth for the dcfence of the

in the common cause, ought to convince
the other powers of Europe, that the

A CARD.
A. B's compliments to the learned
Gracchus. He is thankful for the lumi
nous K.ftrufhons which he has received,
from so able a mailer, in the science of
politics; is considerably ftjuck with the
conceit refpeciing his signature ; âand
hopes that he has now pregrejed far
enough in the Republican Alphabet, to
add C to his title, which every one knows,
stands for Cunning. The address and Ikill
of Gracchns in defending a bad caule,
and his metaphysical niceties, with regard
to the articles, " Sovereignty, Power and
IVill," are extremely edifying ; they an
nounce him to be err.iner.t in his profcf-
Jion, and fit to be the inftruftor of tiie
" ignorant." With such an excellent
guide, A. B. expedls in due time, to
make further improvements, and perhaps
may learn modejly also ; altho' he avers,
that even at present, if he has " made
a boast of his wisdom and a parade of his
knowledge," as Gracchus alTerts he has,
it was unwittingly done.
As A. B. can scarcely believe himfclf
to be " a prodigy of genius," notwith
standing the commendation of the er/t\iunt
Gracchus, he is {till in the dark about
that fame plain bnfinefs of Sovereignty.
He hopes, therefore, for additional infor
mation, with regard to it, if the Nation,
will allow the necefiary leisure to his con
descending inftru&or. He would pre
sume to enquire, if it may be done with
out offence to this fupercilioi:3 gentleman,
whether the sovereign people having veiled
certain fpecificd parts of their sovereign
ty in the President, as their Representa
tive with regard to foreign powers, it
may not be said, that he is, in these instan
ces, a sovereign for the people ; to fpenk
in their name, and a& with their power."
A.B.refpectfully declares,that he docs not,
by this statement. mean to be pert with
his sagacious instructor, nor to controvert
his position, that "Legislation (in which
the President also comes in for a (hare) is
a portion of sovereignty, and the body
which has the legislative power is the so,
vercign" in that refpedfc for the people ;
he only suggests, that " the Representa
tive of the National power," may be ft) -
led a sovereign for the people, uÃiier the
limitations which have been nnn-.::tcd, in
the fame sense which Gracchus admit?,
with refpeft to Congress, the Rcpr.Ten
tative of the national will. He pjfo sug
gests the pofTibility of fuppofir {â¢; bo'.h
these cases, without being; guilty of hi.h
---j treason againii the majesty of the people,
who are acknowledged b v A. o. to be
the source of the title : i ciifputc, and to
ed.â
ity urjmpAÂ« to the cafe of Dir Flaine ; A. B. |
begs leave to observe, that his very want '
of information, with regard to the nature j
of the prosecution ag t niit thct officer } ,
and the doubtful form of queilion in
he proposed that matter, is at lealt
a prtfuijiption in favor of his declaration,
" that he has no connexion with the go- â¢
veraiiicnt." However, after all the elu- |
cidation which has been given to that
point by Gracchus, A. B. ftiU has Ins
doubts. He wishes to know whether Du
Plaine, was considered as a citizen cf the
United States* or a foteigt* functionary in
the Prelident's proclamation ? Whether
the Attorney prosecuted him, that the
Cra.id Jury ihould revoke his con fular
powers, in cafe of his gV'lt, or for a
quite different purpose ? And, finally,
whether he was " Vice-Consul cf BojLonJ'
as Gracchus affertcd. in his firtt publica
tion ;cr a Vice-Consul of France, a fo
rcign agent, imolently treating with con
tempt the authority of this allied country?
Without a fuller explication of these par
ticulars, the public may conclude, that the
object s or the Jury in their verdict and of
the President in his proclamation, were
wholly diilinit; yet compatible with each
other,' and therefore that the latter was
neither a premature interdiction of the
man, nor an outrage upon the palladium
of freemen, the trial by jury.
A. B. humbly excepts against the tin
qualified insinuation, which the learned
barrifterhas dated as his, with refpeft to
the Juries. When he insinuated a aVfeil
cf information to the laws of nations,
or the rules of procedure, between inde
pendent governments in particurar ii&ua
tions, he by no means denounced thera as
Â«' ignorant" men.
With regard to the diftinftion, flill
rcaiatained by the subtle Gracctitis, be
tween tile people and government; A. B.
requcfb to learn, whether the ails and de
ciiion of the President and Judiciary of
ficers in the cases of Henfitld & DuPlaine,
might not as well l>e called the voice of
the people, as .he verdict of the Juries,
and the (hont of a feiv choice spirits who
were colled&ed upon the decflfion. Whe
ther the Sheriff or Marihal itnpannelling
a Jury, and the Jury felefted by such of
ficer, have ' a better right to the denomi
nation, " the peojtU," than the supreme
executive of the uniarr, appointed as the
conUifut'on directs ? Ar.d hilly, whether
the culprits proscribed by the government,
were not declared to be guilty by the
in as solemn a sense, as they are laid
to have been declared innocent by the
people, when they v ere acquitted by the
Jury ? All which is submitted for more
mature cosfidcration.
A. B. is concerned, that his declara
tion of independence with regsrd to the
oScers of government, has not been en
tertained with full credit by Gracchus ;
cfjKcially fmce it may induce a suspicion,
to'that candid gentleman's disadvantage,
as if he himfelf were accustomed to tricks
of dunlicitv.
A. B. is certainly entitled to the fame
degree of credit, as Gracchus, who lias
thought fit to declare concerning, himfelf;
" I have, neither have 1 ever had, any ex
pe&alior.s (rem the Government; ctifap
pointmeDt, therefore, cannot be laid to
my charge. lam ecfy in my situation,
aod neither the fniUes nor frowns of Go
vernment fliall draw me flow my uuty."
Virtuous man ! Kow severely firm ! â
Another Cato, to fnpport the honor of
ail abuful Republic! ! it is presumed,
however, that the worthy gentleman, had
forgotten at the time of this noble tfiu
i'.or., that he had within a few fentencts,
preiic-jflv declared, that " ir.cn who make
k.ud declarations in favor of thc'ir own it:-
trgritj and Â£finitrej}cdÂ«cfi beget suspicion;
for the man of real virtue, NEV E R
make* it a fiibjeit of public declaration."
A. B. disclaims the imputation of hav
ing "dragged" the quondam " Minister
cf Frwce, before the public." That man
officicuCy tbruft himfelf there in the firft
inflaoce. r i"he independent Gracchus had
also exhibited him there, whilst attempt
ing to vindicate his conduct before those,
to trhosi it is at the fame time afTerted,
that he is r..,t refpcnlible : (not even, it is
prrfemed, tiro' he fhouid attempt another
fit- Domir.go Â£cc:ie cf fire and plunder,
znd hl'-ed and dcvzjlation.) A. B. has
no othmrifc abofed Mr. Genet, than as
he has him err! -in epithets, derived
nrrredir-ely from his proceedings, and as
lie has flatsd the faÂ£k which are connec
ted wHh tac odium <xcited in the public
â¢Bind hhn, leaving it to all men to
drats- t!:c nrccSinrv csmclumxis.
To conclude, A. rer t '.efts GraccÂ»: :>
to be pntient, jand keep his temper, as a ,
man, " easy in his lituaiton" ought ;o do.
(By the Wav, to be easy, in cne's fortune,
in one's ewrteflions f and above all, in one's
conscience, if there be any conscience;
(Gracchus can guess what is meant) to
be thus easy is a bleHed thing.) Since
he has volunteered it against the President
upon whom " he rains vengeance?' (al
most), and in favor of Monf. Genet* wbo
is now covered with " the mantle of invi
olability," as well as with " the mantle
of mourning and lince it mull be eon
fefTed that he is an able it is ex

PHILADELPHIA,
FEBRUARY 22.
The Prcjldenf s Birth-Day !
HAIL the Day with patriot glee,
This is Freedom's Jubilee.
This day, being the anniversary of that
aufpieions event the birth of the President
of the United Stiffs, the fame was obfer.
ved here with unusual. demonitrations of
joy. A Federal Salute ushered in the
d-awn, and the bells ofChrift Church rang
peals at intervals through the day. At
noon the Members of both Houses of
Congressâthe Heads of Departmentsâ
the Foreign MinilUrsâhis brother vete
rans, the Society ef Cincinnatiâthe Go
vernor, Civil and Military Officers of this
Commonweal'!! âthe Reverend Clergyâ
the Faculty of the University of Penn
fy'vaniaâand a great aflemblage of other
Citizens, waited on the President at his
house to pay him their refpefts and cosi-
gratulatibns.
The Light Horse, Artillery, 8: Light
Infantry, which paraded in honor of the
day, were more numerous than on any re
cent occasionâand their truly soldier-like
appearance merits the highett approba
tion.
Repeated federal salutes were fired in
the coiirfe of the day, by the artillery in
Hi<rh (treet.
The field officer! of the militia v.ere
dressed in new and elegant uniforms on
this occalion.
The general joy and hilarity evinced
this day, indicate that the purest republi
can principles, actuate the public mind.
The Prcfident enters into the 63d year
of his age.
This forenoon M. Fauchet, the new
Minister from France was introduced to
the Prelident of the United States, by
Mr. Randolph, Secretary of State.
M. De La Forest is appointed Consul-
General of the United Statesâand M.
Petrie, formerly Consul for South Caro
lina, is now appointed Consul of Pennsyl
vaniaâM. Petrie arrived in town yester
day.
OBSERFERâNo. 11.
Mr. Fenno,
The Obj'erver attended last evening, the
exhibition of the Dramatist, and the
Flitch or Bacon, at the New Thea
tre.
His opinion of the inftrumentalmufx
is not only confirmed but heightened, by
the performances of lail night ; he docs
not hesitate to pronounce it, in point of
time and delicate harmony, equal to the belt
in the world ; it participated in a judici
ous mar.ner, of Italian foftnefir, and manly
Jlrengtfi, clearness am', energy.
The Observer is happy to congratulate,
his countivmen upon the acquisition of a
set of Payers, totally rcgardnefs of the
unthinking dictates of the Gallery, efpe
cialiy the pertbimersof inll/umental muiic,
that they play pieces of Music and overtures
instead of fucli flirting jigs, as the Gallery,
are sometimes fond of; he supposes the
President's March is referred, to announce
the attendance of that illustrious hero. If
so, their adherence to plan and principle,
is as commendable in that, as other inftan-
ccs.
The Observer hints to the Managers,
that an adoption of the- American cockade,
by the occasional officers on the Stage,
might not be an improper compliment to
this riling people.
The Company of Players, as has been
suggested on a former occasion, is fe!e&ed,
and the parts filled with uncommon judg
ment. To be particular oi> the exhibition
of raft night, would exceed the bounds
the Observer has set to his occasional re
marks : but justice demands a con-.mendr.ti
on of Mr. Chalmers, in the part of Vapid.
And r.s the Observer means, not, "to
damn -with faint praif," he is happy in
rendering a tribute of praise to Mr. Chal
mers, not beyond his just due, when he
declares, the part of Vapid was never filled
better; and in his opinion, the Epilogue,
including compofitior. and action, has ne
ver been exceeded, since the Bntifli Rof
cious, (David Garrick) ceased to adorn
the Stage and improve mankind, by his
unparalleled abilities. Mr.Chaimers is said
to be a yong a&or, the Observer admonifli
es hiin to use caution, or he may loft, in
stead of acquiring feme, which seems so
much within his reach.
Mrs. Francis and Mrs. Shaw, pofiefs
great powers as aftrelfes, the O-bferver
wifr.es to fee them exhibit again, as well
as Mr. Moreton ; they all promise much,
and the Observer thinks will gain, by re
petition, that enviable summit of applause,
so much fought, and so rarely attained.
Mr. Francis, Miss Williams, and Mrs.
De Marque, hit the true point of taste in
the Caledonian Frolic, and Highland Reel
âany more would have been painful, and
any left would have been vnjufl.
Mr. Marshall, Mr. Darley, Mr. Fran
cis, and Miss Broadhurft, in their respec
tive parts in the Flitch of Bacon, have
done, what thÂ« Observer thinks cannot be
exceeded in Europe, and knows cannot be
equalled iiv-America.
Mr. Fenno,
The political Fable in Mr. Bache's paper
is so apropos to the present iituation
of this country, and to the attempts
of the GalTicans, to seduce us by Cajolery
into the war, that I hare transmitted it
for publication, with a few obvious al
terations.
THE HEDGE-HOG AND THE FOX.
A POLITICAL FABLE
Behold Columbia, fortified
With Fieemen brave, and Neptune's tide,
Can every vaunting foe despise,
In /elf-defence her powefs lies j
But fhou'.d (he \vi(h to-interfere
In foreign broils, and domineer,
She may expect a reckoning day
No coffers could the charge defrayâ
With pointed armour fortified,
The hedge-hog every foe defied ;
While rolled up in a ball he lay,
His enemies were kept at bay j
A Fox that knew all threats were vain,
Addressed him thus in flattering (train
" Arise, great Sir, assert your worth,
Display your armour, sally forth ;
Your presence will the sorest awe,
You'll give the savage nations law."
Tir'd of security and east,
Willing to rule 36 well as plcafe,
The hedge-hog, pompously walk'd out,
When Reynard feiz'd him by the snout,
And soon convinced th' unhappy fool,
He (hould have kept to nature's rule.
Hence let Columbia warning take,
And no Quixotic sallies make,
But recollect, ere 'tis too late,
The hedge-hog's folly and his fatr.
Fro.u ConÃtsrovDNTS.
The f:lf-created order of the Cincinna
ti, is censured in Mr. Bache's paper
for celebrating the President's birth-day.
The fclf-created order of Jacobins, or De
mocrats, are vindicated by the fame fac
tion. To club it to carry points at elec
tions, and at all times to bully govern
ment, are not better views nor more friend
ly to liberty and virtue* than those cf the
Cincinnati.
The devotcdnefs of certain newfpapert
:o 3 foreign interellmaybedifcerned clearly
lyenoush to convince any one* There is
an inctiTant labor to bring, about feelings
and events which aic no! Americanâ
which a true American detests. To dis
organize End degrade our own govern
ment, to set the states above it, to set
clubs above it, to set the people against it
as a tyranny, that deals power from them
by cunning, and their money by corrup
tion and fpecufation j to worry the firlt
man in the world, so as to diiguft hira
with the difchargc of the most rcfpeftable
and ufeful duties in the world, in the hope
that he may retireâto abufc and persecute
every truly able and fioneft public officer,
so as to let the government fink into the
puny hands of feeble temporary dupes, or
into these of knavesâin which caie they
would have it to themselves j these are the
obje&s of party âthese are the topics
which certain devoted printers dilfeminate*
For the truth of this, the appeal is made
to their readers.

of indifputaple authority, f 0 that the fame lhall
be preserved from oblivion.
Another impeachment and the second is now
depending. An officer is charged by the late
Honfe of Reprcfentatives, who hath for many
years been largely confided in by this state, and
filth Jong b en at the head of the financial de
panmeni of the fame, and it imports the citi
