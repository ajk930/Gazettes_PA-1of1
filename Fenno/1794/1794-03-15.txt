Mr. Fsmnd,
- I am one of thole peaceable characters that
seldom attend pnblic me< tings, but as one at*
njy Neighbours told me that the Meeting of
't'uefday evening I all at Mr, M'Shane's waÂ»
of the utmost importance to every cJafsof ci
tizens, I contented to go with hiin.
The business of the meeting was opened by
a little gentleman who after a torrent of de
clamation, brought forward a firing of reso
lutions which he had previoiifly preparej for
the purpose.
In the course of his arguments he justly re
probated the condu& of the Britiih Govern
ment for Aipporting it* cmifers iu il)eÂ»ml de
predations upon th#ci>mmerce of all Neutral
Nation!?, but more pat ticulai ly upon that of
Ameritaâhe then ffcated with a great flow of
language, tht propriety and the absolute nÂ»-
ceifity for this country meeting Britain with
some kind of Retaliation and that in a way
which he considered to be the lead hoftiic.
This Was fir,to recdmitiend to Congress ei
ther by way of Resolution or memorial, tb
make discriminating dut-es upon the manufac
tures of such countries as have no commer
cial Treaties with the United States, aud the
duties arising therefiom to be appropriated as
a Fund for repaying such Merchants as may
have fuffered filiation from the detention or
feizwres of British cruisers. This he supposed
no mati could object to, and 1 coufefs I thought
it very comforting doctrine, but I was not al
together fatisfied of the Fadt, having experien
ced in the couHe of my bufmefs, that additio
nal duties upon ftich goods a 6 we could neither
mauufa&iire or do without, must, in all such
cases be paid by the consumer or perfou who
w nfts them.
*diot
I keep a Store of what \i called Ironmon
gery, two thirds of which is of Brftifb manu
facture, consisting of locks, hinges, laws,
plÂ»ne% gimblets, hammers and a great vaiiety
of othej articles, few of which can be made
here, and none suitable for this market can be
made in any part of Europe but England} if
so, we must import them from that toontry,
and if we must have them the whole duties
fall on the purchafeis In this Country.
If thd duties amount toa prohibition, I must
(hut up shop and pursue some other bultntfsâ
w jllinghowever to examine this question a
little farther, I callfed upon rfiy neighbour
who fells Broad Cloths, Velvets, Velverets
Corduroys, Jeans, Fuftians&c. &rc. aud on en!
quiry found his prices were considerably ad
vanced, viz. Broadcloth from 35 to46f. p r . yd.
which he afTured me was partly owing to ex!
ifttng duties, and equally so to the expertatiou
that Congress would adopt Mr. Madison's re
solutions. He told mo he occasionally had
French clotlis, but the British were generally
preferred by his enftomers; and witb regard to
Velvets, &c. no part of the world could supply
them oh such-good terms both as to price and"
credit as Manchester in England; but fays he
Congress may add to their Duties, I (hall add
ihin to the price, and the people of America,
must pay the whoie.
If theft are fa&s, and they really ftrilce my
mind as such, whence are the duties to arise,
from which a fund is to be appropriated to
compensate the losses of our Merchants ? is
every man thaTt>uiMsahoufe to pay the additi
onal duties on locks, hwiges, &c &t. and every
man that wants a coat, and every Farmer or
Mechanick that requires implements or tools
to pay high prices to compensate the Mer
chant ? for finely the little gentleman wont
alTert that we can uiake those articles in fuÂ£>
fictent quantities for the United States* and if
we nuftlvave them, so long must we employ 4
the British Manufacturers, pay the Tax our
selves and be laughed at into the Ba?gain.
I hope Sir, j have not traofgrefled too mucil
on tlie space allotted in yout paper to better
writers-âtf my brother shop-keepers ai d in
deed people in general, would think timre for
tfceerfiives) they never would be the thipos of
BUSY POLITICIANS.

LONDON* Dec. 20.
Copy of a lettter received yesterday morn
ing from an officer in JLord Howe's
fleet, dated Torbay, Deo. 14, 1793.
MWe arrived here on Wednesday last,
after an utrfeccefefol cruize, the object of
which, (as waÂ» reported), was to inter
cept the French Weft India convoy,.
They, howev*rhave thought propr to go
to America, and in all probability w2l
remain there, as neither life nor property
appear secure in France. On the morn
ing of 18th November, wt fell in with a
Frcngh squadron, confiding of seven fail
of thelme, two frigates, two brigs and Â»
schooner. They were within two leagues
of us before they discovered their mittake.Lor 1 . Ho-rtmad.- a fig;al for fevcral ships
to give ctiuee ; whicL they did, and camc
up io fact, that before i o'clock, two of
our supÂ» began to fire : but whether from
their fnp rior judgment, or our wilful tku
pi 'ity, I know not, but on the rooming
of the 19th no: a Frencjl (hip wis to be
ft"i. It wis th;general opinion that we
could capture ever/ one of them. So fan
gnine were We in our expc&ationt, and at
the lam? time so confident of fucceCs, that
calculations \v. re made of the prize money
which fhotild fall to each m n, but thele
hopes entirely vaniflird with, the return of
light. Ne'er was such apparent oifcon
tc.it seen, as in the morning when the
French fleet had to clear off."
The troops left at Guernsey with the
Earl of Moi'.a, are mostly sick, The ex
pedition is certainly fruftrated for the
p, ;fent. Whether or not it will ever be
reluiried, is another que!t ion.

Geneial orders of his royal highness

Head quarters, Tournay, Dec. 13, 1793
His royal highness the commander in
chief cannot fuffer the troops to go into
v. inter quarters without expressing to them,
pv. vious to toeir separation, the sense he
entertains of the intrepidity, patience, and
perfcverance they have difplaved, so much
to their own honor and his fatisfaftion, in
the course of the campaign.
His royal highness detires the officers
and men will accept his warmed acknow
ledgements, and be allured their meritori
ous exertions have made an iiripreffion on
his mind that never will be effaced He
is persuaded that the good conduct of the
troops in quarters will equal their gallan
try i.i the field.âHis royal highness de-
Ares the officers will explain to their mtfti
the good consequences which mull natur
ally ensue from their conciliating, by their
gocd behaviour, the affection of our Allies,
the fubjeft* of his Imperial Majesty; and
bis royal highness is perfectly allured, that
every officer, feeling the importance of this
obi eft, will take every opportunity of giv
ing it the weight it so iuftly deserves, both
by precept and example.
His royal highness crders, that all the
troops under his command pay proper re
peft to the Hv/i, and all other religious
processions. He directs that all sentinels
carry their arms when any religious pro
cession is puffing; and demands the atten
tion of all officers, but particularly thole on
dutv, to prevent impropriety being com
mitted on these occasions.
His royal highuefs is confident,that the
troops under his command will ever bear
in mind, that, though we differ iu some of
the ceremonies of religion, we unite with
our gallant Allies, and it is our gldty to
do fo,iu everyfentirnentof devotion to our
Creator, and attachment and loyaltv to
sovereigns.
Every regiment of the line on the Iri(h

For lie GjiztTTS of the Usited States-
Mr. Fbnno,
As a friend to the Old Soldiers, you
are requested to give our thoughts and
complaints to our Fellow-citizens especial
ly to members of Congress.
Learning by your Gazette, that ano
ther petition is now before Congress for
the payment of the New Emi/Jion Bills,
our hope of speedily receiving our due, is
revived. We took these bills in payment
for part of the time we served in the ar
my, and were told they would be as good
as Gold and Silv :r, as the individual States
solemnly promised to pay them, and also
to make it certain, the United States in
Congress insured the payment of them,
and pledged their sacred faith and honor
to pay the interest annually until the bills
were paid. But as the war was so expen
tive, Congress could not raise money to
pay every demand as it became due, we
patiently waited until the war ended, but
ft ill we were told, there was not money
to pay us. When the new government
began to talk about paying the public
debts, we expelled these t>ills which were
secured by a double promise, would be the
fiilt paid.âlt is painful to fay, what has
been our difpapointmerrtâOur bills are
not paidâN'cw-York, with true faith and
honor, paid her bills in silver, years ago,
Knd we suppose other States may have
dohe as well; but we never depended on
uny State for payment, bat on Congress
under jvbofe authority we fervedâwliofe
sacred promite we lelied onâand to Coh
grrjs, we now now look up for speedy jus
tice. If the faith of Congrefe is not as
good as that of New-York, the world is
turned upside down, and Hands on the lit-
end ! âBut, will iyuii.faU !.
We have Teen, with iorrow, great debts
paidâmillions funded, and the interest
paidâand State debts afiumedâand onr
bills, the price of pOr sweat and blood,
remain, to this day, unpaidânot even the
interest !âAltho' our demands are small,
they are more neecflary for u>, than thou
sands to rich men- One hundred dol
lars, to an Old Soldier, is a great thin j,
and would sweeten the life of his whole
family for a long time. Certainly, every
good ma* in Congress will be our friend,
and we hope they are now all good.
OLD SOLDIERS,
For the Gazette of ths Unit&j States.
Mr. Fenno,
A number of Citizens, wish to be in
formed, why the Mayor or Recorder of
this city, has not agreeably to the provi
sions of the Ast of A (Terribly, parted the
Bth of March, 1792, been required by a
vote of the Mayor, Aldermen, and Com
mon-Councilmen; to iflue a writ, direct
ing a new election, to be held to supply
the vacancies occasioned by the death of
MetTrs. Jacob R. Howel, Jacob Schriner,
and John Wood, and the resignation of
Mr. James Abercrombie, of the Common-
Council.
It may be remarked, that conformably
to the Ast of incorporation ; a general
election for Council men, will not take
place before the second Tuesday in April,
'795, till wh ch time, a period of 1301-
14 months ; (if the vacancies are not pre
viously supplied,) our representation will
be incomplete.
It is well known, that those members
of the Common-Council, who have died
or resigned, wereufeful active members of
that body : âAnd it is certainly proper
that an opportunity (hould be given to
the citizens, of supplying their places by
men, equally refpeftable, and equally
worthy of their confidence.
If it be said, that is scarcely worth
while to call the citizens together, for the
purpose of electing ortly four Cciuncil
men ; âI reply that four is not an incohfi-.
derable number, particularly where the
loss of four such men as have died or resign
ed, ii to be supplied ; and that btfides,
as it is not probable that more than four
vacancies in 3 years time, will ever hap
pen, and as the Legislature has thought
proper to make special provision, for sup
plying vacancies, they mult have had
it in contemplation, that a new elec
tion Ihould be had whenever such a num
ber of vacancies Ihould take place. The,
Legislature has expressly said, that the
Common-Council Ihould cotifift of 30
members, and have enacted that when the
number (hall fall (hort of that, there
may be an electionâand has the corpora
tion a right to fay otherwise ? such a doc
trine would indeed be a dangerous one.
I have been informed, that a difficulty
has often arisen in collecting a quorum
for the purpose of proceeding to business,
to conllitute which fixteenCommon-Coun
cilmen are neceflary, with the Mayor
or recorder, and 8 Aldermen :âThis dif
ficulty will not so often occur, if the re
prcfentation be complete, and regard is
had to the election of such men, as will
attend closely to the duties of their ap
pointment.
From the effeÂ£t produced, we haverea
fon to think, that the incorporation of
the city, was a wife measure ; the prin
ciples on which it was incorporated, were
well considered, and generally approved,
and the continuance of these good effects
may be bed fccured by the preservation of
these principlesâand taking care that the
number of representatives be fufficient,
and the representation complete.
I trull that these considerations will have
due weight with the members of the cor
poration ; and that they will comply with
the wilh of a large number of their fel
low citizens, in causing a n#w election to
be had.

In cbmmittee of the whole oh Mr. Ma/lifon'i
resolutions
etch of Mr. Madifw.
[continued.]
4. It had been an objc&ion to
folutious, that they might deprive us of
the aid of British capital and credit, which
were necessary to the prosecution of our
commerce.
Mr. M. did not admit either that the
effect would happen, or that it would be
ruinous-to our commerce.
Unless Great Britain fbould, of her
own choice, put a flop to the commercial
intercourse with us, which for reasons be
fore given would be so much more hurt
ful to herfclf than to this country, that it
never could be presumed ; the resolutions
would operate only by abridging some of
out importations, and by varying the
channels of others, Her capital, as far
as requisite here, might continue to be em
ployed here.
On the general question concerning our
dependence on British capital and credit,
he observed that it could not be denied
that more use was made of them at pre
sent, than was either necessary or benefi
cial. Credit when extended to consumers,
as was the cafe throughout the southern
states, was extremely injurious; as had
been well explained by a member of Vir
ginia (Mr. Nicholas,) and as he himfelf
h'ad equally witneffesj. When confined
to merchants, it might, within certain
limits, be an advantage ; but it was not
only his own opinion, but that of better
judges, that the credit given to our mer
chants, was at present excessive and inju-
rious.
In order to form a very precise judg
ment on this fubjeft, it would be necefTa
ry, he said, to calculate the amount of
out own capital, and its proportion to the
amount of our trade. This was a thing
he supposed, which could not well be done.
If he had concurred in the doctrine, of
which so much had been heard both with
in and without doors, that a funded debt
and banks of discount, were equivalent to
affive capital, he should have a ready an
swer to the difficulty,. The paper of the
two kinds, in the United Staffs, cannot
amount to less than onehundred millions of
dollars ; whilst the amount of our ex
ports or our imports, does not exceed one
fourth of that capital. It is true, a part
of both the public and the bank (locks, is
in foreign hands ; but, with the mod am
ple deductions on that account, the residue,
if ope:ating in any considerable degree, as
attive capital, would be a competent re
source.
As he did not however view the doc
trine in the particular light in which it
had been painted ; it would he more to
his purpose, to observe, that there was
certainly in this country a real mercantile
capital to a very refpe&able amount; â
that this was fall inereafing with our in
creasing population and wealth ; âthat if
the foreign capital of one country (hould
be withdrawn, the vacancy would proba
bly by degrees be occupied by that of
other foreign nations J that if it I'honld
happen otherwise, there was reason to be
lieve. that a reftriftion of our use of fo
reign credit, would be rather salutary than
disadvantageous ; that in fine, as long as
we had twenty millions of dollars worth of
produce, wanted by other nations; and
were willing to take for it, twenty mil
lions worth 1 of what they wished to part
with, he was under no apprehension that
the means of effefhiating an exchange,
would not be found. Both merchants
and capital would qiiickly be generated by
such a state of things, if they did not pre
viously exist.
5. It had been observed by fevcral
members, in allusion to the alledged pro
portion of British manufactures consumed
by us to the entire mass of her manufac
tures, that Great Britain would never part
with her navigation ast, in order to avoid
a loss of four per cent, in the demaud for
her manufactures.
To this obje&ion he anfwercd; that
the eomparifon ought to be our consump
tion, not with the entire mass of her ma
nufactures, but with the part entering in
to her foreign trade ; and then the loss
would not be four per cent, but, at least
twenty pet cent ; that this would not be
the only loss (he would sustain, if (he
(hould be unwise enough to (lop the in
tercourse between the United States and
her dominions; that it had been ilreadf
(hewn, that, when '.he apprehended a re
ftriftive system on our part, {he was wil
ling to pievent it, by relaxing herreftric
tive system ; that in times of war, when
an adherence to that system would distress
her, {he frequently suspends her navigati
on act; that at this moment it is suspend
ed in relation to the Wsft-Indies; that
there could be little doubt, if the tempo
rary necessity, were likely to' be made
permanent by firm and judicious measure*
011 our part, chat the remedy for it would
be. made permanent alio.
6. It was objected that the present waÂ«
an improper time for such rcfolutions.
The principal reason given for this was,
that the negociation between the secretary
of state and the British minister here, was
ftill depending. To (hew that this reason
was unsound, Mr. M. went into an histo
rical view of what had palled in reference
to commercial arrangements. He read the
mefiage of the Prelident tp the House of.
Representatives, oh the 14th of February,
1791, acquainting them, that steps had
been taken to ascertain the difpofitionj of
the British court on the fubjeft, and that
there was no ground for favorable expec
tations. He dated, that in consequence
of this communication, a committee was
appointed, who reported that foreign vefc
fels ought not to be allowed to bring into
the United States any articles not of the
produce or manufacture of the country to
which they belong, and that an additional
duty of twelve and an half cents ought to
be laid on all diitilied spirits, the produc
tion of any country or place from which
veflels of the United States were not per
mitted to bring them ; that it being very
near the end of the session when this re
port was made, it was referred to the se
cretary of state, with an inftru&ion to re
port to the next feflion an account of the
foreign commercial regulations affecting
the United Stales, with his opinion, &o.
that at the next feiiion, a letter was re
ceived from that officer, intimating that
in the a&ual state of circumstances, the
report would not be given in, unless called
for by the House ; tuat at the present ses
sion, the report now before the commit
te.', was given in, without being called
for; and was ther fore a proof, that the
circumstances which had caused the delay
ha J van fh :d, and t'.iat at present there
was nothing in train, according to the o
pinlon of the secretary of state, which
ought to r.ftrain the Legiflaturc from
proceeding in the business.
In answer to suggestions, that the Bri
tish minister had, 11 the correspondence
with the secretary of state, lately commu
nicated by the President, manifefted a fa
vorab'e dif-ofitioi, which hid not been
improvedâMr. M. recurred to the paf
fagc which related to this point. He read
from the firft letter of Mr. Jeffcrfon to
Mr. Hammond, dated Nov. 29, 1791, a
paragraph requesting Mr. H. Â« to fay,
whether he was authorized to conclude,,
or to negociate arrangements with us,
which may fix the commerce between the
two countries, on principles of reciprocal
advantage ?" To this reqiieft Mr. H. on
the 30th of Nov. 1791, answered, "That
the King was sincerely disposed to promote
and facilitate the commercial intercourse
between the two countries, and that he
was authorized to communicate to this
government, his majelty's readiness to en
ter into a negociation for establishing that
intercourse upon principles of reciprocal
benefit." On Dec. 6, he wrote to Mr.
J. in order to prevent misapprehension,
that although he was not yet empowered
to conclude aiiy definitive arrangement
with refpeft to the commercial intercourse,
he still meant it to be Understood, that he
was fully authorized to enter into a ne
gociation for that puipofe, Sec. The re
ply of Mr. J. on the 13th of Dec. inform
ed Mr. H. that he had laid his letters be
for the President, and was ready to re
ceive a communication of his full powers,
for entering into the negociation, See.
This was followed next day by a letter
from Mr. H. stating, that he had no spe
cial commiflion to conclude any definitive
arrangement upon the fubjeft of commer
cial i ltercourfeâbut that he conceived
himfelf fully competent to enter into a ne
gociation, and the difcuflion of principles
that might be the bafisof such definitive
arrangementâand that this opinion of hit
competency was founded on the instruc
tions which were to regulate his personal
conduct, and the general plenipotentiary
chara&er in which he had been sent, and
received.

The ftroog inertfure which the British

House of Reprefentat'ruet
Friday, March 14.
The bill from the Senate fupplemcnta
ry to the zÂ£t providing for the punifh
fnent of certain crimes against the Uni
ted States, was twice read.
* The President has approved the bill
making appropriations for 1794.
The Senate has concurred the bill au
thorising a loan of million.
1 1 .vas moved to take up immediately
t part of the resolutions offered a few
d.'/s since, which relates to empowering
the President to lay an embargo if he
IhotiM deem such a measure necefiary.â
Tae motion was loft, owing to the wish
of a majority to pursue the fubjeft of Mr.
Mvlifon's resolutions and give them a
decision.
The house then went into committee
on those resolutions.
A long debate ensuedâin which the
res ilutions were opposed as being incom
petent to the obje&s for which they were
bro't forwardâthe present circumllances
of the country requiring measures of a
more energetic completion. The reso
lutions were supported on the principle
of their intrinsic propriety, and as being
auxiliary to any measures of a more deci
sive nature, which it may be determined
to adopt.
No decision on the merits of the dis
criminating principle in the second refo
ltition, took place.
The dignity of the representation of a
free people was disgraced at the close of
the debate, by a Clapping of Hands in
the G illery, at an expreflion which fell

Upon this a debate ensued on clearing
the galleries : The motion for which, was
carried almost unanimously.
Adjourned till Monday.
PHILADELPHIA,
MARCH 15.
A correspondent observes that he is
happy to learn that the decisive condu&
of the Reprefentativesof the people of the
United States, in their nlmoji unanimous
vote for clearing the galleries yesterday,
receives the aprobation of every real .friend
to the Liberties, the dignity, and inde
pendence of this country, who is informed
of the circumitance.âOur correspondent
is well allured that the measure is approv
ed of, very generally, by the citizens them
selves who were in the galleries, both a
bove.and below; for adds he, the inde-,
corum is well known to have originated
in diftgn on the part of some particular
persons who had perfuadedt hemfelves to
think so contemptibly of the guardians of
our rights and privileges, as to suppose
there was a majority who would counte
nance an insult on the majesty of the peo
ple.
A correspondent asks what right Oyftermen
have to d<ftutb the citizens with the ringing
of Sells in ch- streets ; and if their thundering
vociferations are not TufTicient to rouse the in
habitant â¢ of a square at any given distance in

By late arrivals from the Wejl Indies at

Engli/h papers to the firjl of January,

publijbtd by him.
VIENNA, December 11.
We have accounts from Italy, that a
fquadroix of 12 Britifli and Spanish flilps
oi war appeared before Tunis, andium
moned the Bey to fu.Tender to them the
French cÂ»nvoy of merchantmen from the
Levant, in the name of .Louis XVII. the
lawful King of France ; but that the
Bey's answer was in the Negative.
PARIS, December 25.
The re-capture of Toulon by the troops
of the republic, on which the committee
of public welfare made a report which had
not appeared in print, when these accounts
came away, excited surprise in the breads
of the Sans Culottes, who when this in
telligence was firft announced, did not
manifelt those usual tokens of joy which
they betray on afl other occasions, when
some pretended or real success is mention
ed. It must no doubt, be a matter of re
gret to every true republican, that one of
the fined ports in France is entirely des
troyedâan arsenal, considered as one of
the fineft in Europe, consumed by fireâ.
and a navy, once powerful and refpefted,
became the property of the allies, or a
prey to the flames. The aristocrats of
Toulon, who for the molt part escaped,
leave also to the vengeance of the repub
lic a very inadequate quantity of blood to
be (hed by the axe of the guillotine.
The number of 200 men said to have
been 101 l when the troops of the republic
atchieved this exploit, appears to some
very erroneous and inaccurate; the report
of the committee of public welfare will
perhaps furnilh the curious public with
better and more probable information.
LONDON, January r
Last night Mr. Sparrow the mefienger
arrived from Bruflels, with dispatches from
Lord Elgin, stating that intelligence had
been received there from Paris, of the fact
of the French having regained Toulonâ
but that the retreat of the allies had been
effected without any loss, after they had
destroyed the whole of the French fleet
and the Arsenal.
IMPERIAL HEAD QUARTERS AT
HAGUENAU,December 16.
Yesterday and this day the French attack
ed the whole line of the Austrian army, un
der the command of Gen. Wurmfer, with
itndefcribable fury, from Limbach as far
the banks of the Rhine. Although the lo's
of the Auftrians was hot ipconfiderahle, yet
it is very trifling indeed, if compared with
that of the enemy, who left 200 dead on the
field at the taking of one of their redoubts,
without reckoning those who were wounded
or taken.
December 20.
The Frcnch try every day the greatest ef
forts to break through the lines of gen. Wurm
fer, which extend from Haguenau to Fort
Louis, in which there are 24 redoubts with
200 pieces of cannon. The enemy's design
is to raise the liege of Landau, which fortrefs
is of the greatest consequence both to us & to
themselves.The 18th they strained every nerve
to gain that end ;it was a most bloody and
murderous day,and the chief attack was made
at Fifchbach. The duke of Brunfwick had
before-hand reinforced gen. Wurmfer's ar
my with fix battallions of Prufiians, and as
t rwards came and engaged himfelf in the
ombat. The French were entirely defeat
ed and several thousands of them cut to pie
ces. The vigors who also fuffered conside
rable loss, took 20 pieces of cannon.
The garrison of Landau must now furren
de â¢in a fbort time. It made an unfuccefsful
so tie a few days ago, but it will now fee that
French Sans Culottes will never have it in
their power to relieve that fortrefs.
The affair at Toulon was no otherwise un
fortunate than from the loss of gen. O'Har a.
The objedt of the sortie, viz. the deftru&ion
of the batteryattacked, was accompliftied, and
but for the impetuosity of the troops, would
have been accomplished without lossâYet
this affair seems still to afford food for the ma
licious misrepresentations of the Jacobins.
In the affair of the 30th. captain Hill had
not left gen. O'Hara more more than ten mi
nutes, with a dispatch to bring up the artillery
men, before he returned and found the fort
taken, and the gc neral carried off.
An order has been iiTued from the admi
ralty, for seizing all French produce in Ame
rican ftiips bound to any port in Europe; and
alfoall American produce bound from the
United States to any of the French Weft-In
dia islands.

Monday the 3d inft. under the command
of Vice-Admiral fir John Jarvis, arrived
in Bay Marin on the sth inft. and
fir Charles Grey landed with the troop
early the next morning, and there was
reason to believe Gen. D undas made good
his landing a few hours sooner.
Sir C. Grey took poll Â»t Li Reviere

Brigadier-General White, separated
from fir Charles on the march, to take
pnffeiGon of Ance d'Arl-s, the Grand
Ance, Fort Solomon and the heights
which commanded liletaux Ramiers. Soon
after the march of the army, Capt. Ro
gers having a squadron of frigates & tranl
ports with fir C. Gordon's brigade failed
for Caife Navire, with a view to operate
on, that fide, and to awe Saint Pierre.
By reports of Americans and deserters,
Rochambeau was employed, while our ar
my was in motion, in exertions toperluade
mulattoes and negroes in the quarter of
St. Anne to go into fort Bourbon. '
At 8 o'clock on the morning of the
sth, the admiral dispatched the Nautilus
(loop of war with two ordnance traufports
and two victuallers for the fnpport of the
troops under brigadier Gen. White, who
after a very severe march and some attack
of pods, &c. arrived in the rear of Cape
Solomon Battery and Cape BoHrg, where
the brigadier soon hoiited the British flag
and meant to attack the posts which in
tervened between Cape Solomon and Pid
geon' Iflauds.
On the morning of the Bth inft. Cape
Solomon Battery and Cape Bourg, were
taken without any loss whatever. Brig.
Gen. White, informs, that Sir C. Grey

Extract of a letter from Albany, dated

" I am ferry that I can only inform
you of unwelcome newsâthat is, the re
jection of the bill for fortifying the port
of New-York.
" After a debate of fix hours, most
-earnestly, it was carried againlt as by a
majority of thirteen.
" Conftitutionalty was milch the fub
jeft of confederation : here we had the
better; but an idea that Gongref* ought
to attend to the bufmefs, and bear the ex
pence, I believe, turned the scale. An
infinity of verbage, however, was expend
ed on the occasion.
" Yelterday, on the bill for treating
with the Indian tribrsj we had fume very
lengthy debates on conititutional ground,
better managed than any oik- this iefiion.
It was determined against the conftituti
