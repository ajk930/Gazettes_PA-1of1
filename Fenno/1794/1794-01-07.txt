relation of an arbitrary ast, which aU
tltmigh fetmingly aimed at me, yet
ftrikcfc at the very bafu of the political
linertyofmy country. In giving this
relation, Â«< //$â//nothing extenuateâmr
Jet down aught in make."
On Saturday night the 7th instant, If
was accnlled in my yard by a pcrfn,, who i
â¬Bme in at my Â£r a te, with th? uft-rtl com

poled him an acquaintance, and when he '
came near to the light to be dtf- {
tinguifticd, I rerogm'ztd the person of'
col. Wale Hampton ; close at his heels '
followed tv o w her men ; these, with
the colonel, I invited to walk in ; ;hey
entered and fat down. Mr. HamptoQ,

"which he s'hnied to had reached m\
while in the country, and precipitated
n>y return to ChaiJelton, to fie* rrv
enemits. He then produced his com
tnijfion, which was a bench warrant,
signed by Thomas Waliea, and E. H.
Bay, (two of the afTociate judge?) 10
take iny body in custody, for attempt
ing to levy ttoops from among tbf citi
zens of this Hate, and under commillions
of the FieiiLh republic. This warrant
was grounded on a representation of a
committee who were appointed by tire
house of reprefrntatives now fitting at
Columbia, fettirig forth, " That diverÂ®
pcrfone, citiaens of this Ihte, have wick-
Â«dlyattempted, under afitreignfuilhoriry,
to levy an armed forcc within state, iviih
out the pemiiflion and contlary to Uic
expreis prohibition of the govemnte.rct of*
the United States." This wanir.t a cted
against my body only. I fnbmitied .
it was d<>atiÂ»ed with the eutOTrhv
thole v> the people had to
execute the laws ; and howe^er/ ttnocent
I might be, it was the i" r t 11 P o 9d
citizen to submit, T 1 " fequtl, how-
ever, proved that < I " re was intended,
and the taking of "<y body was the mod
trifling pan. Â£o\. Hampton, after exe
cuting his<<uty as flieriff, produced a
nother Gf power, in the carafter
of ffieri*! mrjfingcr to thehoufe ot repre

figncd fcy Robert "A irdeXon, as chaitman
of a committee by the house,
and composed of Ro'Anderfon,
Henry Wm. DefaulTo*, John Rutledge,
jun. capt. Butler, />hn Drayton, Timo

decides forth, " That William
Tsete, Drayton, John Ham-
Robert Tate, Jacob Roberta
Brown, and Richard Speake, have fe-
veratly been concerned and employtd in
enrolling the citizens of this (late, and
rxciting them to arm themselves in the
fcrvice of the French republic ; and to
inarch out of this Jlate, under officers ap-
pointed and commissioned by theminifter
plenipotentiaiy of the French republic,
and that the said W. T. S. D. See. pus-
of
I N G
fefs certain informations of and in the
premises, as well as divers papers or re
cords, relative thereto, which arc ncctf
fary and proper to be obtained and
brought before the committee, in order
to enable them more fully to discharge the
I trujl and duly commit fed to them, as afore,
said, Bcc. y> Confequcnrly, cos. W.
Hampton was not only aiuhoriTtd to
take the above persons into cnflody, but
immediately, notwithstanding evuifes,
neglects or refnfals, to compel them to
appear before the committee atCnhimbia.
And moreover, to ft arch for all papers,
tecords, memorandums or writings in
any wife t elating to, or touching the pre

the said S. 1). VV . T. See. (and repeats)
" and all papers so found, forthwith, to

place aforefaid." Concluding with re
quiring and enjoining all citizens of this
(late, upon thereunto required, to
be aiding and afliftingâas they Jhali an
fiver the contrary at their peril.
Citizens of America, after perilling
the above, attend to the following :
Hie warrant from the committee, de
claring that divers persons are levying
tvoops, or an armed force', in this Hate,
without permifÃon, and contrary to ike
government, of the United Slates, and
thereby declaring it to be illegal, is aft
nig under the proclamation of the Preii
dent of the United States, dated the
loth of April, 1793, enjoining the ci
tizens of thefc states to obfetve an exail
neutrality refpe&ing the belligerent
powers. Die 3d faction of the 2d article
o! the con(liiution defines the power of
the Piefident, refpx;Â£ting extraordinary
occalions, and such mealures as arc ex
pedient to be taken, in which the law of
has been St fit, lie may rtretrrt
mend ; but it does not empower him to
cieate a new law, however expedient it
maybe. In the jd fcaioti, the ill ar
ticle, declares what treason agaiult the
United States Ihalj c onli(l i. e. the
levying war againll them, or in adhering
to their enemies, giving them aid and
comfort. Ihe 2d clause of the 6tb *r

which flrall be made u-der'thc authority

The constitution of the United States is
the laiu of the land, and on attentively
perusing it, I cannot find a clause which,
in a mod diflant manner, car, beconftru-
Ed, even by the formidable holt of law-
yers who compole the committee, so as
to make it treason in any American's en-
tering into the service of the French re-
public, while that people are not enga
ged in a war against America : for the
3d feftion and the lft article clearly,
wfthout a poflibility of the words being
explained away, or extorted to any other
meaning, fays, " Treason against the

laborers, and good laborers, could not be
obtained for the wages and allowance of
the oloiers. He knew of good laborers
at.mdj employed at and u C der the rate
ot their actual comp^nfation.
Mr. Scot said that it was In vain to ex
pect men to enlist for the present payâhe
knew of no laborers in his part of the
Country, that could be procured for the
allowance ucv.r made to the soldiersâmen,
who could eat and drink, and sleep
and iecureiy at home, and get from 70 to
a yÂ«ar for their labor, would
hardly be induced to rilk their lives for

the officers, but these remained to be en

iri'cafe the United States were called on
to make a great additio* to their military

Mr. Boudinot <"Ued some observations
3 n the fubjcft. At supposed it might be eli
-ifcle to-mafcc some addition to the cloath
|n<T apd rations.
'Mr. Montgomery said he could not un

qual to that of laborersâaccording to
s calculations it was iufenor.

Mr. Scot said he hoped that fiveido!-

tumUr of the militia now in die ifi?h
lorbood of the army to cnlift ; thiche
coftiifted principally of a3

Mr. Hunter said that the (late of South

ighteen pence sterling a day, and he bd
â eived that it v. vain to expect to Rite
neu at the rcduccd wages propofedi he
ras fureit never could be done in the fijr.h-

Mr. Beatty said he was in favor ol the
motion for an encreafe of the payâhit he
stated a modification of the business h re

Mr. Smiley enlarged on the ideas le at

Mr. Wadfworth adde\fome remarks on

The motion for striking out one ar.d in

Mr. Clark moved an addition to the ra

Mr. Parker said he was one of the com

said that one hair the army is now employ

Mr. Findley said in opposition to Mr.
Parker, that he had heard of more com
plaints o.n account of thefcarcity of provisi
ons than on account of thewages : that the
men had frequently been reduced to great
flraits for the want of suppliesâ-to such
straits as that one of them Ind informed
him, the fweeteil moriel he had ever eaten
was a piece of roailed cow hide ; he said j
it was unjust and ungenerous, he would
not fay wicked, to expccl that men in the

the want of a full supply of neceffrry
food. -Ile did not anticipate the disad

Mr. Smiley added several remarks cor

Mr. Hartley moved to flrike out tlr*

Mr. Hartley then added some observa

juflice of adding to the cloathing as well

mentioned, would make the soldiers com

Mr. Wadfworth said he was opposed
to railing the rations to a greater quanti
ty than would amount to the necessaries of

ed to the late continental army, which
had been found fuffioent.
Mr. B. Bourne said that it appeared to
him that more information was wanting to
enable the committee to decide with pro
priety ; he could wish that the motion
(hould lay on the table till that informa

Mr. Findley, to shew that the rations
ha 4 not been fufficient,and that complaints

during the iuveftigation into General St.

Mr. Giles also tw e( j some information

It was then moved to at. en d the mo

This motion -:ccafioned foh, e -ftnther
