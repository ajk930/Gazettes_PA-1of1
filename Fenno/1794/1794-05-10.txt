(To be continued.)
From the General Ad-vertifer.
At a general and numerous meeting of
the manufacturers of the city of Phila
delphia, and such other citizens as re
probate the imposition of an excise up
on the infant manufactures of Ameri
ca, held in the State House yard, on
Thursday the Bth day of May, 1794.
Jacob Morgan, Chairman,
Is+ac Pennington, Secretary.
The following resolutions, together with the
preamble, were proposed and unnnimoujly
adopted :
WHEREAS it is the inalienable right
and bounden duty of all freemen vigilant
ly to observe the operations of govern
ment, publicly to declare their fentiroents
on its measures, and peaceably to remon r
ftrate against every incroachment upon the
liberties and interests of the people j and
whereas the imposition of and excise upon
certain domestic manufactures of the U
nited States, as contemplated by the
House of Representatives of (pongrefs,
appears manifeftly to this meeting, to be
at odce unjust, impolitic, oppressive, dan
gerous, and unneceflary : In erder there
fore to teftify the fenfeof the citizens and
particularly of the manufacturer* of Phi
ladelphia upon the important occasion, as
well as to warn tke legislature of the Uni
on against the introduction of a precedent
so odious, and ,so pernicious, it is
Resolved, That the manufactures of
the United States, however foftered by
the skill, industry and wealth of indivi
duals, remain in a Rate of infancy ; and
rather demand the patronage, than juftify
the exactions of government. The spirit of
enterprise, which led the citizens of A
merica into a patriotic competition with the
manufacturers of Europe, is (till depres
sed, and struggling amidst the embarrass
ments of the unequal contest. The pre
judicesin favour of foreign manufactures;
the inexperience of domestic workmen,
the high price of labour, and the inade
quate amount of capitals, are obstacles yet
to be surmounted in almost every branch
of American manufacture. The charge
and difficulty of introducing domestic ma-
nufaCtories, may indeed be exemplified in j
the recent attempt at the town of Pater
fon ; where, notwithstanding the magni
tude of the original fund, the auxiliary of
a lottery, arid the patronage of Rates and
flatefmen: the projected institution of
national manufactories has funk even be
fore its foundation was complete. To
demand, therefore, a partial contribution
from the individuals, who have thus em
barked and are thus contending in an ar
duous and patriotic talk, is obviously uir
juft, and may be fatal.
Resolved, that it is the policy of the
United States to multiply and encourage
domcftic manufactures ; but the attempt
to render them fubjeas of revenue, at this
early period of their existence, is calcula
ted to prevent the introduction of any
future, and to undermine the profpeiity
of every pjefent establishment. If to the
embarrassments which already attend the
institution of a manufactory, the appre
hensions of a tax equal to 50 or 20 per
cent, upon its produce (as is proposed in
the cases of fnufF and sugar,) (hall be ad
ded, few individuals (and on the exerti
ons of individuals, America mult after
all, rely for her manufactures) can he so
opulent, none will be so daring as to
continue, or to commence the experiment;
a permanent source of national wealth,
will thus be destroyed, by a ra(h and ava
ricious anticipation of its emoluments.
Resolved, That independent of the in
justice and impolicy of imposing any tax
upon the infant manufactories of Ameri
ca, the nature of the tax which is propos
ed, demands a firm opposition to themea
fure. The introduction of an excise sy
stem into the administration of a free go
vernment, cannot be too strongly repro
bated nor too resolutely opposed ; in eve- -
ry country in which it is known, it has
eventually been fatal; it has depraved,
oppressed and enslaved the people, while
it exalted their rulers, by the rigor of its
dispensations and the infwlence of its offi
cers ; it is the foul and poisonous source
from which flow collusion, fraud and per
jury, it cannot be imposed without tyran
ny, nor be endured without baseness.
Resolved, That if *n excise, at all times
oppressive and dangerous, might however
be vindicated by necefiity, even that plea
does not now exist. The federal wants
are not so great that they can only be top
plied by the exertion-os Â«very peflibk re- '
source ; and the terror of war, under
whose influence the excise was proposed, is
happily vanished.
Resolved, That the manufacturers of the
city of Philadelphia should and cheerfully
will contribute in just and equal propor
â  tions with their fellow-citizens to the sup
port of government, its dignity and ere
' dit; but they solemnly protest against eve
ry attempt to impose heavier burthens up
on their labor, or more arbitrary regula
tions upon their occupations than the la
bor and occupations of the reft of the
â¢ community.
â  Resolved, That if during the present
feflion a law (hall be enaCted by Congress,
imposing an excise upon any domestic ma
nufactures, the manufaCturew of the city
of Philadelphia will aflemble at the State
j House (on the notification of the chair
man) to take into consideration what mea
; fures ought to be pursued to express their
j sympathy for their oppressed brethren, and
with a due respeCt for their obligations as
citizens to demonstrate their abhorrence
e of so unjust, so impolitic and so pernicious
( a precedent.
e Resolved, That the foregoing resolu
tions be signed by the chairman, and co
piet thereof be forthwith transmitted to
d the President of the Urtited States, to the
j. Speaker of the Senate, and to the Speaker
, s of the House of Representatives of Con
i- g'els

morning, after a pafiagt-Â®f Si days irorn )
Amsterdam.
The House of Representatives of the U
nited States have been principally engaged
the last fortnight in difcufiing the report of
the committee of fifteen, on the ways and
meansâthe bufmefs was largely debated ;n
committer of the whole, and fundrv amend
ments we re agreed to. The proposed dutus
Oncarriages, fiamps, sal- sat auSion, nwrn -
fa&ured tobacco and fiuffl has and hmfj'*â 
gar, were feveratty objected to, and motions
made for striking theni out, but weTe all ne
gatived, and in general, by larger majorities
than usual. The direst tax on lands from
which 750,000 dollars were proposed to be
raised, was expunged by vote of a great ma
jorityâln discussing the duty on fiamps an
amendment was agreed to, by providing for
? tax on every transfer of funded and bank
llock of the amount of 100 dollars and up
wards, five cents for every 100. Sundry o
ther taxes were proposed, as, an excise on
cyder, lieer, and porter, &c. which were fe
veraily disagreed to. A motion for an addi
tional impolt of ten per cent on all goads,
wares, and .merchandise, the manufaflnre
of Great Britain and Ireland, was brought
forward, but meeting with a strenuous "p?Â°-
' fition, was withdrawnâThe committee o. the
whole having gone thro' with the diicufcon
âreport was made to the Houfe âand the
amendments agreed to, with some trifling
> alterations. The business has been before
> the House for several daysâSome new pro
positions have been made, the conftitutwn
ality of feme of the taxes lis? heÂ«i contro
verted, but no motion for striking out oa
that principle, has prevailed. The Hotrie
adjourned y titer day without finilhing the
t bullnefe âand met again this day.

it a meeting of the iDemocrit-c Society of
Pernlfylvania, held at Philadelphia, on the
Bth day of May in the year 1794Â» *nd of
American Independence the Eighteenth:
Resolved, as the opinion of this society,
hat the constitution of the United States, the
'acred instrument of o(ir freedom which
:very public officer has sworn to preserve in
violate, has provided, that the different de
partments of the government ffiould be kept
iiftindt ; and consequently that to unite them
is a violation of it, and an encroachment up
-3n the liberties of the people guaranteed by
that instrument.
Resolved, as the opinion of this society,
:hat, as by the constitution all treaties are de
dared to be the supreme law,of the land, it
secomes the dnty of the judiciary to ex
pound and apply them ; to permit, there
fore, an officer in that department to (hare
n their formation is to unite diftinÂ£l func
:ions and tends to level the barriers of our
: r. edom, and to establish precedents preg
nant with danger. '
Resolved as the opinion of this society,
that justice requires, and the security of the
citizens of the United States claims an inde
pendence in the judiciary power ; that per
mitting the executive to bellow offices of
honor and profit upon judges, is to make
them subordinate to that authority, is to
make them its creatures, rather than the un
prejudiced and inflexible guardians of the
constitution and the laws.
Resolved as the opinion of this society,
that from the nature and terms of an im
peachment against a President, it is not only
necessary that the chief justice of the United
States (hould prelide in the Senate, but that
he lhould be above the biafs which the ho
nors and emoluments in the gift of the exe
cutive might create; that it is, therefore,
contrary to the intent and spirit of the con
stitution to give him a foreign mission, or to
annex any office to that which he alreatiy
holds.
Resolved as the opinion of this society,
that every attempt to supersede legislative
functions by executive interference, is highly
dangerous to the independence of the legisla
ture, and fubverlive of the right of repre
sentation.
Resolved as the opinion of this society,
that the appointment of John Jay, chief jus
tice of the United States as envoy extraordi
nary to the court of Great Britain, is con
trary to the spirit and meaning of the consti
tution ; as it unites in the fame person judicial
and legislative functions, tends to make him
dependant upon the President, destroys the
check by impeachment upon the executive,
and has had a tendency to contronl the pro
ceedings of tie legislature, the appointment
having been made at a time, when Congress
were engaged in fiictr mrafiirrs as tended to
secure a compliance with our just demands.
Resolved, as the opinion of this society,
that after the declaration made by John Jay,
that Great Britain was juftifiable in her de
tention of the western polls it was a facri
fice of tne interests and the peace of the
United States to commit a negociation to
him, in which the evacuation of those posts
ought to form an essential part; that to
abandon them is to put at stake the blood cf
our fellow citizens on the frontiers, is to
give birth to a perpetual military eflablilh
nient, an endless war, and all the oppressions
resulting from excise and heavy taxation.
Resolved, That the above resolutions be
made public, that they be immediately trans
mitted to all the democratic societies in the
union, as a protest of freemen against the
molt unconllitutional and dangerous measure
in the annals of the United States, and as an
evidence, that no influence or authority
whatever shall awe them into a tacit facri
fice of their sacred rights.
By order of the society.

GENERAL JOURDAN.
[For the recall of this General frop
the command of the French array of the
North, so soon after his late successes, va
rious motives have been alledged. In the
following the truth, we believe may be
seen.]
" SOME curiosity having been exci
ted refpefting the cause, and the manner
of Geneial Jourdan's removal from the 1
chief command of the French army oÂ£
the Northâwe insert an abilraft of the
Report of the Committee of Public Safe
ty on the fubjeft. " After our success
at Maubeuge, the Committee prepared a
plan for driving the enemy from the ter
ritory of the Republic. For the execu
tion of this plan, great boldness was ne
ceflary in the General. This quality is
wanting in Jourdan, who seems to have
forgotten the maxim, That nothing is
" done while any thing remains to be done."
" The committee thought he (hould
be replaced by PICHEGRU, who poflef
fea all the qualities, that JOURDAN
wants. The latter, may return home for
some timeâbut, not as fufpedted Gene
rals do ! He (hall obtain an honorable re
treatâworthy of his probity and putrio.
' ' " â . ' â¢ â¢
\ tifm. He is poorâaad the Conqueror of
J.laubruge, ought to rcccive a teftimoriy
of National Gratitude. We pnopofc to
you to grant him the pension fixed by
law."
; The House of Representatives of the
United States, this day, corapleated the
difcufGon of the report of the committee
of the whole on the ways and means, and
appointed a Committee to bring in a bill.
A resolution was this day moved in the
House for continuing the Embargo to
the 20th of June âand notice given, thÂ»t
it would be called up on Monday next*
By this Pay's Mail.

(N. H.) Kirr.e time since, bound for Point
Pqtre, where he arrived, disposed of his car
go, and pvrchafed a quantity of sugar, &c.
the produce of the Island. He likewise toolt
00 board, on freight for Norfolk, about
3C,QCoi, worth of English goods, which he
took from a brig belonging to a Capt. Blaney,
who was bound from London to Norfolk,
but was blown off the coast last winter,
and had put into Ppint Petre, where the ves
sel was condemned as unfit for sea, and the
goods (hipped on board of Capt. RoilinS..
Just after he left Point Pent, he was taken
by a Britilh privateer and carried intaMont

demned, veflel and cargo, that 00 freight as
well as his own, after the iew orders were
received. The judge told him that he had
private inftru&ions and must condemn all.

The Public are cautioned to
beware of counterfeited Five Dollar Bills of
the Bank of the,- United States, and Twenty
Dollar Bills of the Bank of North America,
federal of which have appeared in circulation
'within a few days pafi ; they are a good ge
neral imitation of the genuine Bills, but may
be diflinguijhed by the following
MARKS.
Five Dollar Bills of the Bank of the
United States.
ALL that have appeared have the letter F.
for their Alphabetical Mark*
The Texture of the Paper is thicker and
whiter and it takes the ink more freely than
the genuine p&per.
The O. in the word Company is smaller
than the M- and other letters of that word,
so that a line extended from the top of the O,
to touch the top of the M. would extend con
fide! ably above the range of the whole word.
In the word United the letters are narrow
erand closer together than the reft of the bill
The i and fln the word promise are not
parallel, the yinclining much more forward
than the /.
The engraving is badly execu?ed,the stroke*
of all the Letters are stronger and the devi e,
in themargi/i particularly is much coarfcr and
appeals darker'ihan in the true bills. Some
ol the counterfeits bear date in 1791âWhere
as thÂ© Bank was not in operation 'till Decern
ber, and no five dollar bills were lffued in
lhat year.
Twenty Dollar Bills of the Bank of North
America.
ALL that have appeared have the letter
B toi their alphabetical mark.
They are printed 00 a paper neaily similar
to that of the couuterfeit Five Dollar Notes
above described ; the engraving is bettei exe
ucted, and they approach nearer to the ap
pearance of the genuine bills.
The fine ruled lines through the word Twen
ty, ii] tlve body of tlic bill, are in number th r
teen \n the genuine bills, and but twelve in
the countei feits.
The word Company is touch like the fame
word in the Five Dollar Bills as defer ibed a
bove, the a being less than the /n, and others
folio vying.
There is no stroke to the / in the word North
whereas in the genuine bills the stroke is well
defined.
The letters ent in the word Twenty, to the
left hand at the bottom, do not couie down to
the line, but are so cut as to give an irregular
appearance to the word, the Tw and the>- go
ing below them.
The signature ]. Nixon, has the appear
ance ot being written with lamb-black and
oil, and ditiers from other inks uied in
printing the bills and the calhier's iignature.
It is iuppoled thcie forgeries were commuted
in iomeot the Southern States, as all the eouo*
terleits thac have appeared, have come from
thence, and two periods have been appieheud*
ed in Virginia, on suspicion of being the author
of' thern.
The reward of ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS
will be paid to any Per ion or Persons who Hi ail
discover and piolecute to convi&ipn tl e teveral
offenders of ihe following defcript|ons or any
qf them, viz.
The pei (on or persons, who.
the paper on which the Bills arc primed.
j The perfou or who engraved the
plates.
The printer or printers, Â»f the bills.
Every period who has a&ed as a principal in
a>jy othci way, 111 the counterfeiting and utter
ing iiie (aid bills.
Philadelphia* 28, 1794
April 22, 1794,
Other counterfeit bills
of the Bank ot the United States have appeared
in circulation.
The denomination is of TWENTY DOL
LAJiS,and the alphabetical maik is the let
ter B.
They may be drflinguiihed from the genu
ine by the following MAKKS :
The paper of (he counteifeits is of a mort
tendn texture and gloifpy lurface than ikt
genuine, and there is no water.mark in them.
The letter C. ia the word Cafliier, in the
true bills, is ftrongfy marked-, whereas in the
counterfeits, the whole letter is a fine hair
stroke, evidently in an unfinifhed ft ate. The
letter a in the wotd demand,, is biadly formed
and the whole ill done, and there is no
comma at the end of it. as there 'is in the
genuine bills.
The marginal device, is much darker in
the falfe, than in the genuine bills owing, to
the shade strokes being coarser, much nearer
together, and conlequently much more nu
merous. This d.fference ftrike&the eye at fir ft
view.
The fame reward of ONE THOUSAND
DOLLARS, will be paid for apprehending, &
prosecuting to convi&ion the above I
defcnbejl Offenders in refpeft to this, as to
the last bills.

Jn Two volumes.
By Mis. ROWSON, of the New Theatre,
Phladelphia, Author of Vifloria, the Inl
quifitor, the Fille de Chambre, &c.
Of Charlotte, the Reviewers have given
the following characlu'.
IT may be a Tale of T ruth, for it is not
unnatural, and it is a tale of real diltrefs
Charlotte, by the artifice of a teachci, recom
mended to a school, from hnmanity rattier
than a conviÂ£liou of her integrity, or the re
gularity of her former condutli, is enticed
from her governess, and accompanies a young
officer to Americaâ-The mavricge ceremo
ny, if not forgotten, ispoQponed, and Char
lotte dies * martyr to tlie incooftanc* of the
over, and treachery ot his friend âThe lito
tions are artlels and aflfe&ingâthe deferip
ations natural and pathetic ; we fliruld fee
tor Charlotte if such a peifon ever existed,
who for one er or scarcely, perhaps, deserved
so severe a punilhment- If it isafiflion,
poetic justice is not, we think, properly dis
tributed
