The brig Betsey, belonging to Mr.
Daniel Sargent, of this town, and com
manded by Jofepli-Saunders, of Cape Ann,
failed from this port, in September lalt,
for BilEoa, and fofely arrived there. Some
of the crew, fearfulof falling into the hands
of the Algerines on her homeward bound
paflage, left the brig, which obliged Capt.
Saunders to (hip other hands. Accord
ingly he took on board one Flemilh.an Ital
ian, and aPortuguefe sailorâwho, when at
iea, rose upon the vessel, entered the cabin,
and killed a passenger by the name of
Wood, belonging to New-London, in con.
ne&icut, who had fold some cargo in BiJ
boa, and had on board the Betsey the pro
ceeds of the fame, which the Pirates being
acquainted with, occaConed the horrid
deed, in hope? of fordid gain. They like
wise attempted the-lives of the Captain
and Mate, the former of whom received
three dangerous wounds, notwith(landing
which they were drove out of the cabin"
die mallei, mate, and one boy contrived
ways to secure themselves in the cabin, by
fattening, the companion and cabin doors.
The pirates, not long after, being delfcu
tute of provisions, demanded foroeÂ°of the
captain; upon being refufed they drew lots
for one of two lads that were on deck,
which to deftroy;âand then info ined
the Captain that one of his boys on detk
would soon be killed, except be fumifh
ed them with provisions. The captain
knowing it to be in his power to preserve
the life of a human being, and aduifted
by the feelings of humanity, consented
thereto. Five days after, one of the lad*
espied a fail near the Western-Islands, and
secretly informed capt. S. of the lame ;
who in the evening hung a lanthern or
light out of the cabin window ; by means
of which she was taken by a British let*
ter of marque, and carried into Barba
does. The pirates were confined in irons
and sent to R this port. They arrived hers
on Saturday last in the brig Betsey, and
were committed to jail yesterday, for tii

of his wounds; being well attended toby

United States, 28th March, 1794.
Gentlemen of the Senate, and of
the House of Representatives,
In the execution of the resolution of
Congress, bearing date the 26th of March
J 794, and imposing an embargo, I have
requested the governors of the several states
to call forth the force of their militia, if
it Ihould be neceflary, for the detention
of veflels. This power is conceived to be
incidental to an embargo.
It also deftrves the attention of Con
gress, how far the clearances from one
diftrift to another, under the law as it
now stands, may give rife to evafioiis of
the embargo. As one security, the Col
lectors have been inftru&ed to refufe to
receive the surrender of coasting licerifes
for the purpose of taking out regilters,
and to require bond from regiflered ves
sels, bound from one diftrift to another,
for the delivery of the cargo within the
United States.
It is not understood, that the resolu
tion applies to fifiiing vessels ; although
their occupations lie generally in parts be
yond the United States. But without
further reflridlions there is an opportunity
of their privileges being used as'means of
eluding the embargo.
A.ll armed vessels, poffeffmg public com
ir.uTious from any foreign power (letters
of marque excepted) are conlidered as
not liable to the embargo.
T htfe circum/lances are tranfihitted to
Congress for their coniideration.

Congress of the United States.
House of Representatives
Thursday, April 14.
Mr.Swift's obfervationjupon therefolution
introduced by Mr. Clark, to prohibit
the importation of the manufactures
of Great Britain and Ireland, till fatis
faChon should be made for the fpolia*
tions on our commerceâfor the ne
groes carried away contrary to the trea
ty of peaceâand till the wefteru polls
be given up.
Mr. SWIFT commenced bis observa
tions by remarking that it was extremely
painful to consume ths time of the com
mittee in difcufling a measure, when it
was apparent that there was a decided
majority against the opinion which he en
tertained. But the resolution on the ta
ble deeply affe&ed the interest of his
country, and would probably be produc
tive of the greatest injuryâhe therefore
deemed it proper for him to offer his sen
timents on the fubjeft.
He said if we turned our attention to
a period not very remote, we should find
our country flouriftiing in the highest prof
penty and felicityâbut the profpeft had
lately been changed. We have been at
tacked on all fides, and our commerce
nearly destroyed. In the Weft Indies we
have not only fuffered spoliations on our
trade, but our citizens have been expofecj
to the mod aggravated insults and 'aLufe
âall wished to obtain redress for these
injuriesâthe difference of opinion respect
ed mode : It was therefore extremely un*
fair to charge the gentlemen who oppose j
this measure with tamenefs under the in
sults and injuries offered to their country,
because they deemed this mode to be in
efficient, when they declared their readi
ness to pursue those measures which they
conceived were most efTeftual to obtain
,aÂ«ion for the injuries we had sustain
ed. i
The gentlemen who advocate the reso
lution on the table, contend, that It is
calculated to prevent a warâto preserve
P Tu~" bf ' m fat ' Bfa<ftion for our injuries
and bring Great Britain to her senses. If
inch would be the effect of the mfcafure,
wou,d o ppose it. But what
reaion have we to believe that such will be
the effect it will produce ? The only prin
ciple by which the measure can
so . lm Portant and interesting to
.. eat Bntain, is our commercial connefe
tionâthal rather than facnf.ce it, they
wll comply w ,th our terms. Bat car. it
tant to'th T T Commerce is f " impor
will n ' ?t tQ de P rlve tl 'cm of it
nece fianfy produce this effect. The
contrary W a s dcmoiiftrated in the late war
w tc tei-minated in our revolution. The
nation were able to exiit not only
without our commerce, but at the. fame
tjine, to carry on a war againit us, and a
gainst France, Holland* and Spain, in
which theyobtaincd victories over the fleets
<Â».f those nations; All this they were a
bled to do wjhout our commeiucâand
they cannot now he said to be lo depend
ent on lis that they cannot live without
us. It cannot therefore be said that this
measure mult necessarily produce the ef
fects which are contemplated.
Mn S. observed, that there were con
cltifive reasons to believe that the resolu
tion would not produce such effects. It
mult certainly be considered as containing
a menaceâa threatâand as dilating
terms to Great Britain. All acknowledg
ed that nation to be haughty, insolent,
and imperious, in the highest degree. Will
not their pride and importance be wound
ed at an attempt to impose upon them
the conditions by which our commercial
connection is to be continued ? Will they
not consider the national dignity to be in
sulted ? Will it not excite a resentment
and indignation that will preclude all pos
sibility of accommodation ? The senti
ments of the Britilh nation in these re.
fpedts are by no means to be juftifiedâ
but if we intend a negociation, we ought
to pursue it in such a manner as will pro
bably produce success, and not address a
proud nation in that menacing tone, which
will defeat the object we wish to obtain.
It happens that some gentlemen have
made Angular calculations upon the suc
cess of this measure. They suppose that
if Congress paf3 an ast prescribing the
terms of accommodation and transmit it
to our Minifterrefident at London, that
Great Britain will be alarmed and fright
ened at the profpeft of the loss of our
commerceâthat they will immediately
comply with our terms and make us the
reparation we demand. An ast of Con
gress is to govern one of {he most proud,
infolei)t> and powerful nations on the
globe. If we are not proud and insolent,
we at least have a claim to a liberal (hare
of vanity anil felf-confidence. This would
be an excellent instrument to govern the
British nationâbut we have reason to
think, that they will laugh at the ide%
iniiead of being frightened.
* Mr. S. then remarked,- that we ought
to pursue a different modeâthat by the
laws of nations, unaccompa
nied by any menacing measures was the
proper step, and there was the faireft prof
pe(S of success. He considered the con-
troverfy and difputc subsisting between
Great Britain, and the Unjttci States to
be in a situation peculiarly proper for, ne
gociation, and that there was the faireft
bafiÂ» for explanation and acccommoda
tion. He said that no complaint had
been made on oui part to the court of
Great Britain, dating our injuries and de
manding fatisfaftionâand that when Mr.
Pinckney our minister at London, demand
cti an explanation of the intention of the
Britiih court by the order of the 6th of
November, they declared that no condem
nations were to take place in virtue of it,
which would not have been legal if the
order had not been iflued. A construc
tion wa6 put upon that order by the minif
tj7Â» which denies the principles on which
the condemnation in the Wdt Indies had
been founded, and Which of course, dis
avows the trani'a&ions of .which we com
pfein.
We may therefore fairly suppose, that
the Court of Admiralty in the Weft-In
d'es > have contradicted the orders and in
tentions of the Britifli Ministry."* We
have not heard what effect these condem
nations of our vessels, have had ,on the
fintifh Courtâlf we fliould ftateto them,
the injuries we have fuflained, which we
ought to do, as they have been committed
in a remote part of their dominions appa
rently contrary to the design of the court.
There is the strongest teafon to believe,
that we shall obtain redress, because by
their own conftrudtion, of the order of
the 6th of November, they have dis
proved of the principle, by which the in
juries have been committed, and of course,
they are bound by their own conftru&ion,
to make us that fatisfa&ion, which we
demand.
Mr. S. laid if we concluded a negoci
ation, without giving offence, it was pro
bable we should obtain the influence of
be Bnt.fh fubjefts in our favor. If, when
110 , cr ' Ca " merchants in London, dis
covered the order of the 6th of Novem
ber, they were alarmed, and immediately
demanded an explanation of the court,
lh'Â» (hews that there is a powerful inte
m that in favour.of a con--
merciai connection w.ia this :âlf -re dd
nothing to wound their pride, this iuflii
ence will be exerted to preserve the con
nexion. The tautual inteix-ft, and Wel
fare of both countries, may be fairly tak
en into consideration, in adjusting tne dis
pute. But if we adopt a menacing- met
lure, offenfive to the nation ; we ft. all ] o f e
the influence of our friends, in accompliib
ing an accomodation. While such is the
state of our affaire, we ought to try a
fair negotiation on equal and liberal teu'i, 3j
unembarrassed by any menace or infuit|
and there <<an be no doubt, but that the
measure will be attended with fucceis.
B " t '/ 9" e . at Blitain wi:l not negociate
and do juflice to this Country, Mr. S.
pledged himfelf, to fiipport the mofi enerl
getic measures to affcrt our rights, and
maintain our national dignity. When war
had become unavoidable, and that time
might happen,he would meet it with firni
nefs and fortitudeâbut while it was pofll
ble to preserve peace, he conceived it to be
a duty, he owed his country, to do all in
his power to preserve it.
(To be Continued.)
Prom the American Daily Atbxr&jer.
Mejfrr. Dunlap & daypoole, !
1 the liberty bf troubling V ou
to publtfh the following extra&j from the
President's Speech to both houses of
Congress, at the opening of the prefeut
session, on the 3 d of December.; and to
recommend the fenti'ments therein conti
nued to the particular attention of all
your readers, being as applicable 'in the
present situation of our affaire- as at any
former period.
After having taken a view of the situa
tion of the United States, in relation to
the powers pt war, he pro'oceeds as fol
lows. '
" I cannot recommend to your notice
" meafuresfor the fulfilment of our.duties
" to the rejl of the world, without again
" pressing upon you the necefllty of plac
inÂ£ oqrfelves in a condition of complete
" defence and of exa&ing from them, the
" fulfilment of their duties towards us.
" The United States ought not to indulge
" a persuasion, that, contrary to the or
" derof human events, they will forever
" keep at a distance those painful appeals
to aims, with which the history of eve
â¢' ry nation abounds. There is a rank due
" to the United States among nations,
" which will be withheld, if not abfo
" lutely loft, by the lepucation of weak
" ness. If we desire to avoid ir.fult, we
" must be able to repel it ; if we desire
to secure peace, one of the molt power
" ful instruments of our rising profpetity,
it must be known that we are at all times
" ready for war."
He then refers to certain documents
(hewing the amount and kinds of arms and
militaiy flores on hand, and recommendÂ»
a further provilion, (as also a different or
ganization of ( the militia) in order that no
thing might be left to the uncertainty of
procuring a warlike apparatus, iu the mo
ment of public danger. After which he
o rves, " NÂ° r ca n such arrangements,
" with such ohje&B, he expoftd to the
" eenfnre 01 jealotify of the warmed friends
"of republican governments. They are
/incapable of abuse in the hands of the
" militia, who ought to pofles a pride in
" being the depositary of the force of the
Republic, and may be trained to a de
gree of energy, equal to every military
" exigency of the United States."
His concluding advice is worthy of him
Â» an{ J ought not to be Overlooked by
Congress. "Permit me, gentlemen, to
bring to yoirr remembrance the nvigrii
" tude of your task. Without an t.r.pre
judiced c the welfare of the go
" vernment (nay be hazarded ; without
harmony, a.s far as confifls with freedohi
J kntiment, its dignity may be loft.
But as thejegiflative proceedings of the
' United Stntes will never, I trust, be
reproached for the want of temper 01 cf
caudour : so fliall not the public hap
" P'" c ' s from t ne. want of my
i.renuous and warmed co-operation."
If the foregoing advice was fully com
plied with by Congress,, I think I could
venture to predid that we would have no
occasion to engage in a rur.ious war.ln ad
ition to the adt for fortifying the ports
and harbours and procuring warlike ft ores,
it is fmcerely wished that provision might
be mad? Lr fck-ftipg a refpedable lorce

To the Speaker and Members of the Af

â > i
THE Siibfcriber apprehends he has at
great labour and expence much improved
on the common mode of manufacturing
pot and pearl a (lies, for which improve
ment the United States have granted hiin,
an exclusive right for a term of years,
'i iit* advantages over the former is set forth
by divei a Certificates, one of which signed
by David Rittenhoufe, Do&or P.ufh and
others, hath been published. By variety
of improvements in the application of the
principle, he apprehends he has so far Am
plify'd it, that at small expence it ir.ay be
conduced by women or children, altho'
larger the works greater the profits result
ing in proportion. In a work that maycoft
about 12 dollars to be worked by a boy of
12 or 13 years old, with attention, may
make 15b weight of pearl ashes, and with
good house ashes at gd per bushel, wood at
20s per cord ; the peail ashes so made when
fold at the common price of 50s per hund
red,leaves about 40s for his week's labour.
The process is allowed to be easy and fami
liar, one of those small works is now Hand* 1
ing at his house in Arch Street No-43,and
is fiee for infpc&ion to any that inclines
to vlfit it; he therefore wishes a fuitdjle
Committee may be appointed, one or more
members of each County to examine the
fame, fee some experiments performed,
and ihould it be thought after every necef
favy examination, this Improvement prefer
able to the former, and a general benefit
to this State, in bringing forward this ma
flufa&ury in which little heretofore have
been done, he willing to relinquilh hisafor
faid right,as saras relates to Pennsylvania,
for i'uch a compensation as the merits of it
may appear reasonable todefire.
SAMUEL HOPKINS.
2d Mo. 19, 1764.
A work that may cost about 300 dollars
when compleat with 4 large boilers worked
by 2 fires, 2 hands may make as much
pearl ashes as common black salts, perhaps
18 or 20 cwt. per week, it may require
about 7 cord of wood. The quantity
made in a certain given time, will always
depend on the attention of the workmen,
the size of the furnace, the quality of the
ashes, &c. &c.
The Committee appointed Feb. 25,laft,
on the* memorial of Samuel Hopkins,
made report, which was read as follows,
viz :
The Committee to whom was refered
the application of Samuel Hopkins to the
Legillature, on the fubjeft of an improve
ment djfeovered by him in the manufac
tury of pot and bearl ashes, beg leave to
toreportâThat they think favourably of
the, prayer of the laid applicant, and aie
of opinion that it will beadvantageous for
the State to have the mode invented by
him, rendered â of general utility, by the
purchase of his exclusive privilidge in the
dilcovery, which they underltand may be
effeded on very moderate termsthey
therefore recommend the following refolu
tton:
Rtfofoed, That a Committee be ap
pointed to bring in a bill to grant the sum
of Â£ to Samuel Hopkins, in re
ward of his discovery, and as a compensa
tion for the furrettder of his exclusive right
to said improvement, within the limits of
this commonwealth.
