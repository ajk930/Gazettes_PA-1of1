Tranjlaicdfrom the Ley den Gazette, March
1th âFrom Manheim Feb. 26.
Thtfe following are the most exact ideas
which we have of the petitions of the French
troopsâThe army of the Rhiney command
ed by General Michault, since the departure
of General Pichegrue, is divided into three
bodiesâThe firft which forms the left wing
has its head quarters in tRe valley of Neu-
Jtadt, and fends its patroles to Furckheim â
It now extends from Neivjladt to Franken-
Jiein, Tripjiadt, and Kay/erjlautem âThe se
cond, of which the head quarters are at Schif
ferjladt occupies the borders of Rehbach. â
General Defaife has the cofnmand of the ad
vance giiard, the fame, who surprized, some
time since the' poll of Oggerjheim ; froih
whence he fends off from time to time de
tachments against Mundenheim ; polls which
are still occupied bp the German troops.â
The third body which is the principal,
and which is commanded by General Mich-
Milt iA p'erfon cbvefsStTie Rhine to the envi
rons of Spires and GermerjheimâHis head
quarters which were the convent of Horil
â  bach, are transferred to Kircbe-veder due
league from Neuftadt. The French at Spires
and Germerjheim, are commanded by Gen.
DelmasâAll these corps belong to the army
of tfi'i Rhine, since it is certain the ariAy (?f
the Mafe'Ne has quitted the environs of Deiii-
Ponts. The garrison of this city is : C6rit{sS
fed of ten thoufend troops, Bavarian Pala
tines ; one thousand grenadiers, 400 huflars,
and 300 Austrian artillery. General Count
Browne, returned the 16th of this month
from Moytnce, where he conferred wish the
Marechal Mollendarjf,, who takes,the dky af
ter fo-morfctW the chief command of the
Austrian army âwhich had been under GoUiit
Wallis, in confeqÂ»ence of his being the oldest
General, and not the Prince of Wald*ck. â
Weare afliired that the Prince will immedi
ately quit this army to replace in Italy, 6en*
Fins, who retires on account of his age, or
perhaps some other cause.

" Yesterday all the vessels at Port au-
Prince, mads their escape from ther.ce,
but were prevented going further thaa
this by Captain Rowley and captain Per
kins. The cause of this sudden bufmtfs,
was owing to the parties there falling out;
-Â»-thecotifequcnce was dreadful: they put
all the better fort they could lay hold of
to death, which amounted to 600.
" From this tranfaftlon we may short

The Malt Bill also passed a Coasiftit

Mr. Wilberforce said that there had
been some npprehenfion by many that his
motion wottld go to the total abolition ps
the slave trade. His iaeason that fnbjÂ«?6t,
went to that length some time ago, and he
had altered his sentiments upon that sub.
jeÂ£t, but the motion with which he fhoulj
conclude, was confined to the preventio n
of any supply by us to any of the foreignfeTrltories with slaves from the Coast. of ,
of Africa That was a part of.tKte trade
vVhich in fact could hardly how be laid to
exist, and the main object of his motion
was that it (hould not be Yevived; and
therefore it was unnecefiary for him to Ar
gue the point at length, he (hould wait to
hear what Was to be urged agaiiift his mo
tion, rather than labor to establish the pro
priety of it, as the fiibjeft had been amply
dilcuffed and the argument long ago ex
hauited. He therefore moved that leave
be given to bring in a Bill for preventing
the supply of Foreign territories with
slaves froal the Coast of Africa, and that
this motion be referred to a Committee of
the whole House.
This motion was opposed.
Mr. Wilberforce replied to all the ar

House of Representatives.
Ways and means under confide) ation.
On Friday last in committee, Mr.
Dexter observed, that very few of the ob
> jeftions were confined to the question.
1 Some were arguments against all excises ;
some against all public contributions;
some against the nature and administration
! of our government ; and some against all
; goyernment. The statement of the gen
: tleman from Maryland, (Mr. Smith) that
1 the duty would make three times the ca
pital neceflary, he said could not be accu
: rate. He had reckoned the cost of the
â  raw material employed ; if this be true,
I as he dates tobacco nt 4 cents per
r and fnuff is worth 30 cents per pound, it
â¢ follows that the manufacturer makes 750
â¢I per cent, net profit. Tl* cannot be
true ; the principal capital must be em
ployed in preparatory works and labor of
nttfiiifa&uiing. He added that our hav
ing formerly protected the manufacture,
is no reason againlt now taxing it. It
wctuld rather be a reafon,for calling on it
to contribute to the puÃlic burthens. He
said the fame gentleman asked, why there
is no.excise on beer manufactured in New-
England, as well as im foilthern whilky ?
I anfwet, beer is not manufactured there
in any considerable quantity *, if it were,
it ought not t6 be taxed. New-England
rum is taxed enbrmoufly. The duty on
this and whi(ky, are protecting duties to
good morals. The life of fnuff and to
bacco is certainly a mere luxury* or ra
ther folly, and all who use and of course
pay the duty, are volunteers. A land
tax, which is named as a substitute for
this and every thing else, is 3 tax very un
equal, and laid on all the neceflaries of
lite, and opprefiive to the laborious poor,
it looks like governmental rapacity,
which is so deprecated by the gentleman
from Pennsylvania, (Mr. Smilie.) He
has more than once told us that insensible
taxation is daangerous; and that we
should make the people feel the taxes they
pay. The way to make them feel taxes,
is to lay those which will be most inconve
nient ; the argument then is that the most
inconvenient tax is the belt. The very
faCt stated to reason from is the ftrongelt
reason in favor of indireCt taxation, viz.
the burthen is so small that the people do
not feel it. What the gentleman's meaning
is, unlets it be that measures ought to be
taken, which may make the people diffa
tisfied with the government, is difficult to
fay. The fame gentleman has said, that
&U excises are against the spirit of a repub
lican government like ours- It is strange,
said Mr. Dexter, that the spirit and let
ter of our government should be so con
tradictory ; for by the cor.ftitution, ex
cises are expressly provided. The man
who buys his food and clothing in imall
quantities, as he "can obtain the means,
does it much more easily than he could
purchase a flock for a year at one time ;
and he who buys dutied articles, and re
gulates his confnmption by the price,
pays his tax in small portions, with ease,
when he would be diftrefi'ed by being cal
led to pay the whole sum in gross arir.nal
ly.âMr. D. proceeded to fay, that as to
the fears of the gentleman abovemehtion
ed from Pennsylvania, and also of the
jrcntleman from
he had heard them too often to be alarmed
at them : They seemed like a sale coat,
made for any fubjeCt. He said that a faCt
fatisfied his mihd on the fubjeCt. Con
necticut.is a land of equality beyond any
on earth. Scarcely a man among them is
rich enough to keep a coach, and" scarcely
one so poor as not to keep a hoi fe ; learn
ing is more equally diffufed there than in
any part of America ; their morals are so
pure that crimes hardly have names; yet
this happy race of equal republicans never
since the lnflitution of olir government,
have sent one member here to whine or
thunder about the ariftbcracy of our con
stitution. He said he would not compare
this slate with others in the union ; one
man was not there disposed of at the will
of another. As to the fear of the gen
tleman from Virginia, that excises would
destroy American liberty, Mr. D. said
there was no danger of it. The charac
ters of individuals form the character of the
government. * A people are never enslav
ed until they need a matter. The Ame
rican habits exclude all danger. That ex
cises and slavery exilt together in some
part, of Europe is true ; but it remains
to be priced that ole is the cause of the
other. It we havj the benefits of go
vernment we must pay for them. There
was a time, said Mr.' D. when laboring
under the debility of disunion and thedif
trefles of anarchy, we rejoited that the
people had inftitutedthis government. It
is now represented not as the guardian of
liberty and innocence ; but as the afTaffin
of both. What has happened to change
our opinion? Under its auspices we have
encreafed in strength and riches ; we are
now free and happy when the world is
in confufion. The gentleman from Vir
ginia seems to despise our prd'ent happi
ness, unlcfs it can be eternal. Whv fir
should we expeCt th!i? Nations,'' like
men, come to maturity, they grow old
and perish. The furi must go out in dark

PHILADELPHIA,
MAY 7.
Extrall of a letter from Edinburgh, receiv
ed by the late arrival at Neiv-Torlâ
dated 22d Jan. 1794.
" The state of my dear native country
appears to me more dark and gloomy than
1 ever knew it. In the rtfbellion of 1745.
the country in general was warmly attach
ed to the revolution fetrlement, and look
ed with horror on a change of govern
ment. If France had invaded us in the
time t>f the American war, those who
most disapproved the measures against A
merica, would have been as zealous as
those who approved them, in repelling an
invasion. But though I believe a great
majority in Britain wish the preserving
our present happy conflitution, I am a
fraid there are many in fume parts, espe
cially of those employed in manufactures,
who, if there was a landing of our ene
mies, from the hope of levelling all ranks
and fortunes, would be tempted to join
them, and who have so fat shaken off the
principles of religion and jultice, that
they would fciuple no ast of violence or
cruelty by which they might better their
circumstances. There are, indeed, men
of fortune and virtue, who, from real
principle, wish a reform in our constitu
tion, and have countenanced societies for
endeavouring to procure itâbut many of 1
the meetings of Societies for Reform, or
Friends of the People, consist of persons
of broken fortunes, who never had any
character to lose; nor is it improbable,
that those of them who would spurn with
abhorrence, the idea of pra&ifing fitch
cruelties as take place in France, by join?
ing with those furious men, might learn
their ways. I cannot but approve your
found policy in America, in endeavoring
to keep clear of the war. I-t would" have
been wife in our administration also, if
they were not forced intt> tne measure by
discoveries of ferret negociations between
France and people at home who wiftied to
overturn our conftitulipw : The pacific cor
dudt of Mr. Pitt, hi other mftance#,
KU r-cel ivr tliiftimftiing the ttÃ-
tional debt makfts this the more probable,
though he might have good reasons for
not disclosing the extent of his informa
tion, nor the channel through which it
was-conveyed."
Letter from Barcelona February 15, 1794.
Lord sTood failed from the Tflaiids of
Hieres with chief part of his fqtiadron the 13
January, leaving fir Hyde Pa.'Uer to keep
the ffation from Marfe'lles to Nice. His
lordlhip went diredfly over to Corsica, and
was e!cfe in with Caliz, hut a violent gale of
wind came 011 ana prevented any landing
bein;; made there ; the dry before they ran
in io dole the Lc*ia chalc-d aw 1 engaged a
large 40 gun frigate, which by dint of fail
ing and boats that came out escaped into
Cafe, where the and another frigate were
seen the next day.
The I.eda loftten men Â°:n the engagement,
ana was very rrui h cut up in her rigging.
Lord Hood arrived at Prat Ferrzro on Elba
the 28th January, and there is reason to fnp
pofe he failed again with the greater pari of
tlie Squadron about the sth of this month
for Corsica. While they were at Elbe an
officer from General Paoli joined I hem, and
he reprelented that nearly allthe inhabitants
of the ill a; id were anxiously waiting for the
Engliih as their deliverers, hut were under
the greatefl terror that the French -might
push over the reinforcement with-which ihey
threatened the Island. It was known in re
ality that the French since the reduction of
Toulon, had prepared 7000 men at Nice to
watch the firil opportunity of being able to
flip over to Corsica ; and .the frigates seen at
Caii? had been cruiiing to favor the paflage. ,
We are anxious of course to hear news f*'< m
that quarter. The L'Aigle did not go into
Toulon, as it was feared /he might hive
done ; but the Amphitrite was 101 l on a reef
of rocks near Leghorn, the crew were all
saved, the purser came to Port Ferraro with
the account the 29th January.
Before the.squadron left the Bay of Hieres,
the tÃth January, seven men who escaped
from Marseilles in a Genoese boat came on
board the Vitflory; they came out of Mar
seilles in the night of the 17th. The account
they gave refpefting that place, Toulon and
Lyons, was extremely fhockirgâlnftead cf
4cc people havim* been put to death at Tou
lon, they aflejted that upwards of 5000 had
been lhot. That all the priefls without ex
ception were destroyed, every where j and
every person related in the moil diflant man
ner to any of the wretched fugitives, vrere
htinted cut, arrefed, and gene-ally put to
death. At Marseilles net a davpaficd wita
* tout si ve or fix people being executed in form
ajid the aiTaffinations in the streets and hou
fes were numberless. The prisons were al
crammed full, and it was expe&ed they weii
loon to be cleared by a general maflacre, for
provisions were become so scarce that with
out a very great reduction of the number of
mouths the people mud soon be reduced to
eat each other. At Lyons rhat was said to
be already the c;ife âand as'the army had
secured what little provisions there was, the
miserable inhabitants have risen en masse and
fought defperattly with knives, flicks, and
any other weapons they could meet with,
that in (hort, no description could equal the
1, errors that reigned thro' all the south of
France ; and nothing prevented an immedi
ate general counter-revolution, but the abl'o
lute want of arms with' every description of
people, except the soldiers, who feenied de
termined to make an end of every body and
every thing that does not dire<SUy luit their
present purpose.

related to two very principal objects. The J
â  e firft-was, that the Ruffians should in frt- j

[. in all the Turkiflj dominions, and the le
>f cond was, to in fill upon thp liberation of â

? renew them, although the Grand Signior
- appears determined, notwithstanding the
f interposition of the courts of Vienna and

f The Divan have ordered the neceflary

MARKS.
Fm>e Dollar Bills of tke !Bank of (he
< United State*.
ALL that have appeared havjthe letter F.
for their Alphabetical TVlarJc.
The Texture of the is thkker and
whiter and it takes the ink more freely than I
the genuine paper. j
The O- in the 'W>rd Compear? isfmaller:
than the M- and othfr letters of thit word,
j so that a line extended from the tqp of iheO;
to touch the top of the M. would extend con
(jdtrably above the range M the whole word.
in the word IJnited the letters are narrow,
erand closer together .than the reft of tbtbill
I parallel, the f incliniog much more for.WjrJ
[ than the f.
I The engraving"is-badly executed,Â»be strokes
I of all the Letters are stronger and tfie devi e
I in particularly ismncji cÂ«ar(er and
I appears darker in the true bills. Some
I of the counterfeits bear date in Where-
I ?s the Bank was not in'operation till Decern
I ber, and oo five dollar bills were ifitiea in
I ihat year.
I Twenty Dollar Bills of tbe Book tf North
America-
ALL that have appeared have the letter
J B. for their alphabetical mark.
I They are printed on a paper nearly'fimitar
I to that of the couuterfait Five Â©ottar Wntes
I above daftribed j the engraving is biitet eite-
I ucted, and they approach nearer to thp a|>-
I pearance of the genuine bills.
'The ftne rnled lines through the word Twev-
I ty, in the body of the bill, are in number th r-
I teen in the genuine bilk, Â»njtl but twelve in
I the counterfeits.
The word Cokpany is much like the faflie
I word in the Five Dollar B'.lJs as defer ibed a
-1 bove, the o being lets than them, and others
1 following. ~ ,
I There is no ftrok<? to the tin the wotfl Airtlt
I whereas in the genuine bills the stroke is well
I defined.
I The letters ft'in the word Twenty, to tre
I left hand at the bottom, do mot Bome dov+w to
I the line, but are so cut as to give an irregular
I appearance to the word., the Tai and they go-
I ing below them.
The ligoature 1 Nixon, has the appear -
â¢ I ance ot being written with l.iÂ«Â»b-bla<k and
\ I orl, and differs from other inks used in
1 Sprinting the bills and the' ca'(bier's flgnature.
I It is supposed thc(e forgeries were commuted
I in Tome of the Southern Staves, as all tbe coÂ«ui-
I terfeits that have appeared, have come from |
I thence, and.tw*v persons have been apptehcn.d-
I ed in Virginia, on fafpicrion of be rug the aafhor

1 LARSj'and the alphabetical mark is tl e let

I They may be dift'mguithei from the genu-

I The paper of the conntevfeits is of a mor<
I tender texture and gluiTey furface than the
I genuine, and there is no water mark in them.
I The letter, (i. in the word Caftfier, in tbe â¢
I true bills is ftrtoogly marked, wheieas in the
I counterfeits, the whole letter is a fine hair
I ftt;oke, evidentlyjn ap unfiniflied ftafe. The
I letter a in the w.urd demand, js badly formed
I and the whole word ill done, and there is no
I comma at the* end of it, as there is in the
I genuine bills. '
I The marginal device, is ippeh darker in
I the sals?, than in the genuine bills owing to
1 the ftiade strokes being coarser, much nearer
I togetlier, and etwfequeirtly much more nu-
I merous. This ilie eye at'ftfft
