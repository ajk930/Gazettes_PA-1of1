While I was in the upper parts of

the great revolution that has taken place,
and the much greater that's likely to take
place in Florida, and this country, caused
me to come here from the town of Waflv
J. '"S 10 "' I have resided these fix
months past, but am not allowed to land
â¢- Â° nt othcr of the river, without
e being sent immediately to St. Augustine,

M Intofti, are in the Moro Castle in the
â Havannah; are allowed eight bints per
day for their support, as well as the pri

others are in St. Augustine, and allowed
a room in the barracks; and my father
has been allowed to write out to the fa
mily.âA few days ago, the Florida
lcout, came opposite Temple, and played
us Malbrook on the French Horn : My
brother Billey was along with them, who
informed me, that Mr. Queen, was about
to write to me to invoke me not toioin the
trench ; and also, desired me to inform
you of the fame circumitance, viz. if ei
ther of us did so, my father's property
would be forfeited ; however the business
is now carried too far to uetraÂ£L The
burnt aH-their hoflfes be
tw-een St John's and St. Man's, with .
out diftinftion, and there is upwards of
twenty families moved on this fide of the
river, who are fettled on Merit's Bluff a
mile below Temple. Billy informed
- that Colonel Howard had 26 cannon at
the Cowford, and was building a Block- '
house at Trout Creek : They have sent

1 lie lpiiit of party work since your de

what is to be more lameuted, those viola

Squire Flemming, John Houston, and
a number of others, have been killed by
the Indians. A few days ago, thev kil
led a woman at Coleraine Fort, a few
miles above us ; in short we have been in
a continual state of war ever since you left
this country, and now it has got to* a high

on one fide, the Spaniards 011 the other
and the deluded people under the directi

To the CITIZENS of the United States.
The aidr.fi of the Delegates from thefever al
Societies, formed in different parts of the
U uted States, for promoting the abolition
of slavery, in Convention assembled at Phi'
ladelphio, on thefirjl day of January, 1794-
Frlends and fellow Citizens,
,UNITED to you by the ties of citizen
(hip, arid partakers with you of the blcllings
of a free government, we take the liberty
of addrcfling you upon a fubjeft, highly in
teresting to the Credit and prosperity of the
United Statei.
It is the glory of our country to have ori
ginated a i'yftem of opposition to the com
merce in that part of our fejiow-creatures,
who compose the nations of Africa.
Much has been done by the citizens of
some of the states to aboliih this difgraceful
traffic, and to improve the condition of those
unhappy people, whom the ignorance, or the
avarice of our ancestors had bequeathed to
us as slaves ; but the evil (till continues, and
our country is yet disgraced by laws and
practices, which level the creature man with
a part of the brute creation.
Many reasons concur in persuading us
to abolish domestic slavery in our coun
trv.
It is confident with tlie fafety of the
libertits of the United States.
Freedom and Slavery cannot long ex
ist together. An unlimitted power over
the time, labor, and posterity of our fel
low-crea.ures, neceflarily unfits men for
discharging the public and private duties
of a Republic.
It is inconsistent with found policy ;
in expofjng the ftatcs which permit it, to
all those evils which infurreftions, and
the molt refentful war have introduced
into one of the richest islands in the Well
Indies.
It is unfriendly to the present exertions
of the inhabitants of Europe, in favor of
Liberty, What people will advocate free
dom, with a zeal proportioned to its bles
sings, while they view the purelt Repub
lic in the World tolerating in its bosom
a body of Slaves ?
In vain has the tyranny of Kings been
rejected, while we permit in our country
a domestic despotism, which involves, iri
its nature, most of the vices and miseries
that we have cndeavorei
It is degrading to our rank as men in
the scale of being. Let us use our rea
son and social affe&ion for the purposes
for which they were given, or ceale to
boast a pre-eminence over animals, that
arc unpolluted with our crimes.
But higher motives to jutlice and hu
manity towards our fellow-creatures re
main yet to be mentioned.
Domestic slavery is repugnant to the
principles of Christianity. It prostrates
every benevolent and just principle of ac
tion in the human heart. It is rebellion
against the authoiity of a Common Fa
ther. It is a practical denial of the
extent and efficacy of the Death of a
Common Saviour. It is an usurpation
of the perogative of the Great Sove
reign of the Universe, who has solemn
ly claimed an exclusive property in the
Souls of Men.
But if this view of the enormity of
the evil of domestic slavery should not
affeÂ£l us, there is one consideration more
which ought to alarm and imprels us, es
pecially at the present jun&ure.
It is a violation of a divine precept of
universal juitice, which has, in no in
stance, escaped with impunity.
The crimes of nations, as well as of
individuals, are often designated in their
punishments; and we conceive it to be
no forced conftruftion, of some of the
calamities which now diftrefe or impend
our country, to believe that they are the
measure of evils, which we have meted
to others.
The ravages committed upon many of
our fellow-citizens by the Indians, and
the depredations upon the liberty and
commerce of others of the citizens of the
United States by the Algerines, both
unite in proclaiming to us, in the mod
fcr ille language, "to loose the bands
of wickedness, to break eveiy yoke, to
undo heavy burthens, and to let the op
prefled go free."
We (hall concludc this address by re
commending to youj
Fitji, To refrain immediately from that
fpeciesof rapine and murder which has im
properly been foftentd with the name of
"he African trade". It is Indian cruelty,
mid Algerine piracy in another form.
Secondly, To form Societies, in every
(late, for the purpose of promoting the a
bolition of the Have-trade, of domestic,
flavei y, the relief of persons unlawfully
held in bondage, and for the improvement
of the condition of Africans, and their d<t
fcendants amongst ns.
/ The Societies, which we represent, have
be held,j with- riumph, thefuccefsoftheir
exertions, in many instances, in favor of
their Afiiean brethren; &in afullreliance
upon the continuance of divine support
and dire&ion, th.-y humbly hope, their
labors will never cease, while their ex
ists a futgle (lave, in the United States.

A mefTage was received from the Presi
dent, communicating a letter from Mr.
Hammond, in answer to that from the
Secretary of State, communicated confi
dentially yesterday, also a letter from the
fame officer, alluded to in the minister's
letter. The message and papers accompa
nying them were read and ordered to be
published, together with the letter at firft
communicated in confidence. The im
portance of these communications require
a publication of them at full length; this
(hall be done as soon as it is in our power.
It will be some fatisfaftion to the public,
however, to know immediately something
_of their general tenor:
The Secretary makes men
tion of the speech of Lord Dorchester to
the Indian tribes, in which an idea of
war is held out, and which he conliders
as bearing marks of authenticity. He
then adveits to intelligence received by
the President through a channel of real
confidence, of the progrffs of Col. Sim
cor, to be followed by three companies,
in order to establish a port near the falls
of the Miami of the lakes, in the territo
ry of the United Statesâwhich he con
siders as actual hostility. The Secretary
requests an explanation on these points,
mentions the impofiibility that our
commander in that quarter should distin
guish between the Indians and any other in
vading force,and contrails these profeffions
& conduct ofthe British with the peacea
ble measures pursued by' this government
towards that nation. The minister does
not deny the authenticity of the speech,
but endeavors to explain away the most
exceptionable paflage. He complains of
the conduct of the Vermontefe to those
inhabitants in their neighborhood under
the prote&ion of the British, and inti
mates that the eftabh'fhment of a post on
our Territory, by the British, may be ne
ceflary to repress filch conduct and pre
ferâ¢ the Jlatu quo during the pendency of
negotiations.
He concludes by enumerating certain
meafutes adopted by our government re
lative to maritime concerns which he
deems grievances. He alfp adverts to the
late tranfaftion in Newport,, in which
four American seamen were liberated
from British service, and-which he terms
an insult on the British flag.

REPUBLICAN EDUCATION.
PARIS, January TO.
The pupils of Leonard Bourdon made
a public exhibition last week in the Re
publican Lyceum.
They underwent an examination in the
Constitution, modern languages, arithme
tic, geometry, fortificatiou, and rhetoric;
fencing, danc ng, and foine musical per
formances on the violin andharpficord , ac
;om?.iiii--d with the voice, agreeably di
versified the excercifes of these young Re
publicans. Geographical charts, designed
by them, drawings of figures, landlcapes,
natural hi (lory, perfpeftive, architeftuie,
I and fortification, were exhibited.
Leonard Bourdon commenced, with a
view of his plan, for the regeneration and
improvement of public education.
One of his pupils gave a very spirited
and intelligent account of the interior or
ganization of this society, in which every
young Frenchman enjoys his right, and
contributes to the framing and executing
of the laws.
A description of the (hoemakcr's art
terminated the fitting, which seemed to
have excited much intereu in all the spec
tators; '
This was not a little increased by the
simple and ingenuous recital which two
youths, between 13 and 14, made of the
services they had already done their coun
try, and the wounds, which they receiv
ed in Belgia and Larendee.
It fefems to be the intention of Leo
nard Bourdon, that, in the progress of in
ftruftion, the sciences, mechanics, and
the fine arts, are to keep an equal pace,
and thus mutually to assist each other.
The dress of these young Frenchmen
is plain, light, and void of every kind of
restraint to cramp the free movement of
the joints ; it is at the fame time becom
ing and calculated to display a good fi
gilre to advantage.
Every month there is to be a similar ex
hibition, and public examination of the
pupils.

KINGSTON, (Jamaica) April 12.
The American (hip Sampson, lately
commandedby Captain Jo(hua Barney, and
her cargo, were condemned on Wcdnefday
at a court of Admiralty in Spanifti Town,
as lawful prize.
The grounds of the condemnation, we
underltand, were, for afiociating and a fl
ing in concert With the enemy, and defend
ing the enemy's property, as well as divers
others acts contrary to the laws of neutra
lity.
Extract of a 1 tter from St. Marck's, dat-
Ed the 28th of March.
" The villain, Sonthonax, isina critical
situation at _Port-au-Pifiicg","Trnrofie ficte
entirely domineered over by Montbrun and
Puirelina, and on the other threatened by
Desfourneaux, late Lieutenant-Colonel of
Artois regiment, who, with above a
hundred of that regiment, have joined
the English, at Leogane, and taken the
oaths of allegiance to the British govern
ment.âDesfourneaux is collecting a great
number of men, in order to go back to
Port-au-Prince with the English.
"We have this day heard a report (and
there is great appearance of truth in it)
that a chief, named Jacinthe, at the head
of great numbers, has conquered both
Sonthonax and Montbrun, has opened
the gates where the white prisoners were
in Port-au-Prince, and that he has sent
them all to Leogane : that he has forbid
den, under pain of death, any insult or
injury to be offered to any white person,
and that he is determined to deliver Port
au-Prince to the English, on capitulation.
I am not surprised at this extraordinary
news, as I know the influence of Jacinthe,
and that he is advised in every thing by a
gentleman of great ability."
A Monsieur Renaudin, lately Aid-de-
Camp to M. Sonthonax, was apprehend
ed on Monday, in consequence of infor
mation given at the CommiiTary's office
by the captain of the brig l'Aif, and car
ried on board the prison-ship, where he is
now closely confined.

BOSTON, May 17.
On Wedncfday evening, the performances
at the Theatre in this town, were for the
benefit of the unfortunate Americans now
held in bondage in Algiers. We (hall not
attempt a panegyric on Mr. Powei.l, for
his benevolence in this meafnreâthe " re
cording angel" has placed it in the archives
of Heaven ; and the prayers of the captivsa,
whole cup will be sweetened by the ac\, will
to him be more than ample recompence.
The sum colleite-d, amounted to Nine Him
dred Dollars. Before the performances, the
following Address was spoken by Miss Har
rison, in her accustomed style of excellence :
AS on the parching bosom of the plain
Descend the genial Ihowers of kindly rain,
As the blue tint of Heaven with fragrant
breeze
Dispels the pallid fpedlre of disease,
So thro' the wounded mind, and thrilling
sense,
Flows the fweetbalm ofbleft BfnevolfncE:
To the loft wretch, by daily tortures torn,
Who wakes to weep, andonly lives to mourn,
Can with elecftric touch new powers impart,
And warm to infant life the palsied heart;
Bid the rais'd Eye unwonted Language fpcak,
And drops of transport bathe the red'ning
cheek;
With looks, that bless, the saving hand re
gard,
And give to feeling worth a rich reward.
That rich reward be yoursâvvhofe 'oofoins
share
The fufferer's wrong, and feel his patient
tear;
Who, while your Powell's generous heart
expands,
While pity pleads, and social right com
mands,
From your full stores the liberal boon afford,
And with the wretched (hare the plenteous
board ;
With him who once in fortune's splendor
(hone,
And call'd the hospitable roof his own,
Saw his lov'd offspring climb his parent knee,
And weep to hear the tale of Misery ;
Perhaps, by valour's glorious fervor led,
In fields of fame the fetter d exile bled,
And with your Patriot Hero bravely rose,
The scourge of yours, andfacred Freedom's
foe.
Tlien if that Patriot Hero claims your love, â¢
While distant realms his deathless deeds ap
prove,
If still he shines his grateful country's boast,
The central Sun, that lights her brilliant coast,
From the dark Dungeon of supreme despair
His bleeding friends, bis prifon'd comradas,
bear,
Let not that arm the grinding fetter feel,
Which dountlefs Freedom brac'd with nerves
of Heel,
Let not the villain-fconrge disgrace the brave,
NorfreeColumbians wearthe Stampof Stave.
And you, ye civic band ! whole peaceful
days
Disclaim the trophied field and warrior's
praise,
Whose fecial virtues gentler cares heftow
On thÂ£ foft plainings of domeiii'4-woe ! â¢
If e'er the lpell of powerful charms could
move,
While fond enchantment melts the foul to
love,
Bids the fix'd-eye's exprefiive glance impart
The fofteft secret of the speaking heart,
With kindred Ibuls regard the Lover's prayer,
Whom fiercer pangs than cruel absence tear;
And while the chaste Almerifi' j fancied sighs
Call the bright tear-drop from reliftlefs eyes,
Let real woes one liquid gem receive,
To real want the boon of Bounty give ;
Since e'en your pleasures form a kind pre-
To deal the blelfings of BerttvolaiA.

which failed from Charleston under a forged
French commission, was captured a few days
ago by the privateer schooner Fiying Fish,
belonging to New-Providence. It is report

The St. Joseph's commission is in tilt hands
of a palTenger in the Charlellon, who re

fliip.
An house, at the corner of South and Sixth
street, was struck on the roof by the light

through. The lightning defended along
the fitje of the wall, where it moved foine
bricks, made a hole through the fide of the
staircase, and went quite down to the cellar.
The kitchen was filled with a sulphurous
smoke and smell. The miftreCi of the house
received a violent .stroke on the hinder part
of her head, and a negro servant woman re
ceived an injury on her back.

Nobody will deny the ufefulncfs of pÂ°-

OCCASIONAL ADDRESS.
tence,
PHILADELPHIA,
MAY 24.
From Corrxspokdekts.for it has to oppose, not scattered and dif
piritcd complainers, who may be kept un
der the harrow of law, and demolish
ed as fad as they lh jw themselves, but it
has to oppose an organised body, acting
in phalanx, thus tyranny is pulled down,
because it is overmatched,- and perhaps
there is no other way to pull it down.
But whtfn a free constitution is erected, it
is ridiculous, if not worse, to talk of con
tinuing or reviving the fame society that
existed to makt wav for it. Is it to be
expected that the conquerors of the Baf
tile should be rallied at the found of the
tocsin, to attack the temple of libertyâ
a temple of which the aflailants them
selves are the priells and the keepers.
When the cauff of liberty shall (land in
need' of these clubs, the necessity will
speak for itfelf. America was at no loss
when flie had need of them, nor how to
life them. France saw them trample des
potism under foot. The danger is that
those who manage them, will infill upon
their be ; ng used when they are not wanted.
The poison that killed tyranny is a bad
diet for liberty. Down with your clubs,
therefore which like most tyrant kil
lers are ambitious of taking their pla
ces, who would like better it appears, to
be the heirs of departed power than co
partners in the new acquisition.

Mr. Fenno,
: THE fine arts have always been the
objects of jealousy : People of sense have
admired and fools have traduced them.
I hat which I think it my glory to pro-
I fefs, and which has yielded me so much
honor in Europe, has likewise been the
occasion of many enemiesâbut, from the
heighth of the clouds, I crushed them
by my biilliant fuccefles.
Reduced to creep along the giound in
this country, for reasons which have been
fufficiently detailed in newspapers, and
fully appreciated by persons of sense, al
low me to answer the ribaldry, infertcd
againfl me, in your No. 533.
I have made it always a rule to let lit
tle puppy-doffs bart at me, Sic,
ever giving myfelf the trouble to turn a
bout and drive them away, and if I an
swer to your impertinent .cribble, it is out
of conlideration for the public, and not
irf order to defend myfelf against you,
who are unknown, and who dare not
name yourfelf. In your preamble, you
call 'me an adventurerâyou are right I
am an adventurer* as celebrated thro' the
universe, as you are unknown to the
world. You fay, that my talents have
gulled the public of its moneyâyou do me
a great deal of honor, and I could wilh
that I had received the money you speak
ofâbut, unfortunately for me, this has
not been the cafc in this country ; and,
y ou , further add, that after having your
money, I twit you as ignorantsâ¢â God for
bid, that I (hould have such an opinion of
a people, who have made more progress
in one century, than Europe did in 400
years of its infancy, and who bid fair in
a few generations fully to rival Europe :
But moderate your ambition, Sir, you
are not so far yet.
1 he epithet of Balloon-man, which you
have bellowed on me, {hews your want
of taste and esteem for the fine arts, the
fame as your advice with refpeft to the
Cylinder of Steel, proves your entire igno
ranee in natural philosophy.
But, as you even criticise the immortal
Buffon, one of the greateÃ genius's of
his age, you deserve the pardon and the
pity which I bellow upon you in the
name of the public, whom I (hall address
arte wards.
Only a coward will remain anonimous

other means, but as not one of the iron
works qould succeed to answer my views,
as every body may be convinced at my Ro

reasonable for the public, which has paid
nothing towards all my attempts, to blame

" Then? seems as if there were great
changes about to take place in the world.
Twenty four millions of people, bigoted
to the Popilh religion, carting it off at
once ! which in all probabilty will make
way for the pure gospel; though at pre
sent there appears such confufion.
But there is something that will more
astonish you. I have been informed by
persons of the great eft refpe&ability, the
Rev. Mr. Eyre, and the Rev. Mr. Ald
ritch, that in the ensuing summer, a
Congress of all the rich and learned Jews
is to meet at Amsterdam ; for whichpur
pofe they have sent round to all the prin
cipal places where there are Jewish con
gregations, for them to fend delegates to
'he Congress. The question to be agita
ted is,
Whether Jesus Chrijl â¢was the promtfed
Mejfiah ?
My dear fir, if thi3 should take place
and they agree to acknowledge hihi as

The Public are cautioned to I
beware of counterfeited Five Dollar Bills of j
the Bank of the United States, and Twenty |
Dollar Bills of the Bank of North America,
fe-veral of which have appeared in circulation
'within a few days pafl; they are a good ge
neral imitation of the genuine Bills, hut may
be dijlinguifhed by the following
MARKS.
Five lyollar Bills of the Bank of the
United States.
ALL that have appeared have the letter F
for their Alphabetical Mark.
The Texture of the Paper is thicker and
whiter and it takes the ink more freely than
the genuine paper.
The O. in the word Company is smaller
than the M. and other letters of that word,
so that a line extended from the top of the O,
to touch the top of the M would extend con
ftderably above the range of the whole word.
In the word United the letters are narrow
erand closer together than the reft ot the bill
The i and fin the word promise are not
parallel, the f inclining much more forward
than the i.
The engraving is badly execuied,the ftiokes
of all the Letters are stronger and the devi e
in the margin particularly is much coarier and
appears darker than in the true bills. Some
ot the counterfeits bear date in 1791âWhere
as the Bank was not in operation till Decern
ber, and no five dollar bills were iiiued in
jhat year.
Twenty Dollar Bills of the Bank of North
America.
ALL that have appeared have the letter
B for their alphabetical mark.
They are primed on a paper nearly similar
to that of the Couuterfeit Five Dollar Notes
above dcfcribed ; the engraving is better exe
ucted, and they approach nearer to the ap
pearance of the genuine bills.
The fine ruled lines through the word Twen
ty, in the body of the bill, are minimbei th r
teen in the genuine b lis, and but twelve in
the counterfeits.
The word Company is much like the fame
word in the Five Dollar Bills as defer ibed a
bovc, tfie 0 being lei's than the w, and others
following.
There is no stroke to the / in the word North
whereas in the genuine bilis the stroke is well
defined.
The letters ent\n the word Twenty, to the
left hand at the bottom, do not. come down to
the line, but ate so cut as to give an irregular
appearance to the word, the Tiu and go
ing below them.
The ] Nixon, has the appear
ance of being written with lamb-black and
01, and differs jrom other inks ukd in
printing the bills and the calhiei's lignature.
It is fujjpoied thefc forgeiits were commuted
in tome of the Southern States, as all "the coun
terfeits thai have appeared, have come from
thence, and two have been appiehcnd
ed in Virginia, on (ulpiCion ot being ihe author
of them.
will be atty jPci ion or Pes ions wholhai
difcovei and profccute to conviction the ieveial
offenders of the following def r riptions or any
ot them. viz.
Ihe per (on or ptrfons, who manufactured
the paper on which the Bills are printed.
The person or perions, who engraved the
plates.
The printer or printers, ot the bills.
Kvery person who has adled as a principal in
any other way, in the counterfeiting anu utter
ing the laid bills.
Philadelphia, iMarch 28, 1794
April 22, 1794,
Other counterfeit bills
of die liank ol the United Stales have appeared
in circulation.
The denomination is of TWENTY DOL
LARS,and the alphabetical maik is the let
ter B.
They may be diftingutlhed from the genu
ine by the following MARKS :
T he paper of the counterfeits is of a more
tend r texture and glofley furface than the
genuine, and tlieie is no water mark in them.
1 he letter (.. in the word Caftiier, in the
true bills is ftiongly mat kt d, whereas in th*
counterfeits, the whole letter is a fine hair
troke, evidently in an unfiniihed state. The
letter a in the word demand, is badly lornicri
and the whole word ill done, and thete is nÂ»
comma at the end of it, as there is in the
genuine bills.
I ma i r Blnal8 lnal device, is much daiker in
