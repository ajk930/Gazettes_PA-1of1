AN D
For the G.izette of the Ui;ited Stj-ti s.
Altho' it is believed that there is but
little danger to be apprehended from the
declining influence of the Democratic So
ciety in this City, we can be at no loss
to discover from the conduit of thcprefent
atii-vc members, the motives by which they
were governed in bringing about its elta
blifliment.
With a view of imprefiing on the minds
of our unfufpectiiig citizens, the evils which
naturally arise out of such political iiill i
tutions, 1 mult beg you to rtpubhjk the
following excellent letter from a viper of
lalt Summer
Virginia, 27th July, 1793.
A 1 a meeting of Citizens, Hanover
County, Virginia, the Principles, Articles,
Regulations and Circular JLetter of the
Democratic Society, at Philadelphia, hav
ing been read and consideredâ
Refoh'cd unanimously, That the follow
ing letter be addrefied to David Ri 1 TEN
house, Esq. and others, member) of that
Society
Fellow Citizens,
sHE principles recognized by your
fjciety being among those on which our
free and happy Conditution is founded,
no true Republican will helitate to sub
scribe to them. We join you also moil
cordially in opinion, that at this criiis it is
more particularly the duty of every indi
vidual to use his utmoil efforts to remove
the prejudices and conciliate the affections
of all other fellow citizens; and that, to
obtain these most deiirabie objeÂ£ts, it be
hoves all to cultivate on all occaiicns peace,
order, harmony arid attachment to the Con-
Jlitution; and, having the general welfare
only in view, fedulouily to avoid even the
appearance of party diltinftions. But we
cannot refrain, fellow citizetis, from ex
pressing our apprehensions that political
focietiee, branched out and assuming pow
ers to tne extent you recommend, may,
however pure and well liitentioned in their
commencement, be perverted into clubs of
faction, as has been too often experienced,
and terminate at length in Courts of Inqui
sition. We apprehend that a dread at least
of such confequer.ces will at any rate ex
cite heart-turnings and diffentions âfatal
precursors of Anarchy, and its invariable
followerâDefpotifm.
We are happy in the conviction that
the citizens of the United States, who of
their own free choice have adopted the
Con flit ut ion under which we enjoy Pence,
l.ilerty, and Independence, are fully com
petent, by the modes prescribed by that
Constitution, to correct the abules which
may and will, from time to time, creep in
to this and all other human injlitutians. We
arc happy also in the conviction, that the
citizens of our free independent Republic
can, without being driven to the necefilty
of forming themselves into societies or par
ties (proper at certain times for fuhjetts of
monarchical and despotic governments, where
the correction of abuses orcliaage of pub
lic men cannot otherwise be brought a
bout) approve and aid those whole valor,
virtue and patriot ism, contributed to pro
cure and continue to preserve to lis the
blefllngs of Peace, Liberty &Independence,
and cau by conjlitutional modes too, dis
countenance or punish their public servants
of a contrary description, and change the
whole system of government, when they
judge it proper to do so.
We are more particularly averse at this
time to the appearance of party diftindti
011s, which too often end in civil difien
tions, being deeply affeded by the horrid
massacres and devailations recently expe
rienced by our insular friends, with whom
we sincerely sympathize on the melancho
ly occalion. We deprecate the like dread
ful calamities, which will inevitably deluge
our common country, (hould party differ
ences fever the fraternal band and dissolve
the Unionâthat barrier which alone can
save us from the miseries of civil discord,
and its certain confequenceâforeign do
mination, It is Union alone that can con-

From the Connecticut Cour ant.
THERE is at all times among our
people a curiofityto know the state of po
litics, a id especially the temper of Coti
jrrefs. This curiosity is peculiarly season
able in the present critical and alarming
state of American affairs. Much wifdoin
firmncfs and pcrfcverance have been dif
plaved bv our government during the last
lix months to keep our politics from run
ning into co.ifuSon and ruin: But these
would not have been fufficient to extricate
them t'roin the fnaies that French emifia
riet, reinforced by an autifederal facXion,
had spread for our ptaee, had not good
conduift been afÃfted and crowned by pe
culiar gov>d fortune. The enthusiasm for
the French in Philadelphia, and in some
otherfea ports, waa blind and violent e
noiyb tohavjhurricd our country into the
war, if those who undertook to make a
hÂ»ck of our foil) had not over driven it.â
T. ty hurried even tliole who fcemed to
be willing to run head foremolt into the
Tf. r, quite out of breath. Had he bufi
ntisol' privateering been conducted with
m i.e f!c:il and address, our people would
have been engaged,in very great numbers
in imfciug a piratical war upon England,
an J our country would have been involv
ed in it the power of retreating.
L lckiiy however, the French cmiflartes
made a mistake in fuppcling our people
more crazy than they really were, and in
co ifequeiice they came to their senses.â
The whole country fried out againlt pri
vateeringârhePrefident found a solid sup
port, and the hopes of the war-party i'eem
ed to be destroyed.
The eyes of the nation have been turn
ed to Congress; the unanimous appro
bation of both houses of tilt proclama-
tion, and other mcafures of the President
to preserve a fair and impaitial neutrality,
has lulled to deep the jealousy that watch
ed over America's peace, as if war being
voted out of Congrefc it was now impos
sible to engage it. The danger is not
over. Our citizens are not to be led into
the pit with their eyes open : nevertheless
tluy may be led into it. New schemes
are to be tried ; the projedl is now to trick
the co.i.itiv into the war.
It was certainly natural for our citizens
to fed good wifheu in favor of the French
I (lioutd almost disown an Ame
rican for a fellow-countrymen if he did
not earnestly desire that liberty and good
government may be enjoyed by every na
tion of the earth.âlt will certainly be
\ery great good hick if we make fhift to
keep out of the war, and one very wife
and falutaiy measure to that end is the so
lemn declaration of the President, announ
cing to the world that our neutrality (hall
be fair and impartial. It concerns the
good faith, the truth and honor of our
country, that we adhere to the spirit of
this pacific aifurance, as well as that we
abftniu from privateering and all other
acts of hostility. We have a right to en
joy our own private sentiments and to ex
press them freely ; but without contesting
the right of any persons to be as ra(h and
illiberal as they think proper, is it pru
dent, manly or even honeit, after the de
claration of an impartial neutrality on our
part, to fill every newspaper and every
circle of company with enthusiastic pro
fciTions of attachment, and even devoted
nefe, to the French cause, accompanied
with the most provoking expressions of
scorn and hatred of the English ? There
is as much true dignity for a neutral na
tion to forbear taking a fide as to inter
meddle with the quarrels of others. It
is below the American character to wrap
ourselves up in the cloak of neutrality to
(hew our scorn, hatred and 01 will to
wards those nations with whom we are at
peace. What is this but to (hew that
vrs are neutral enemiesâthat although our
government abstains from war the spirit
of our people is hostile : Yet such has
been the complexion of several of our
newspapers, which are not only a disgrace
to our country, but contribute all they
can to involve it in the war. That such
is their tendency, and to a degree that is
dangerous, will be manifeft to any one
who will take the trouble to reflect on the
alarming and unparalleled state of our af
fairs. Almost every European nation is
in a frenzy of desperation and rage.â
Their passions have mounted to a height
unknown in former wars. In such a
state, it is but a word and a blow. In
the bosom of America we have a faction,
the unrelenting enemies of the national
government, and now the devoted tools
of French emiflarics, who after having
vented all the abuse and insult possible on
the combined powers, are eagerly impa
tient to proceed from words to blows. Is
this a time for a nation, whose exifter.ee
would be hazarded by a war, to irritate
and insult those powers of whom it calls
itfelf the impartial friend ? It is the ally
of Holland,and Spain was its early bene
factor in a season of distress. Initead of
gratitude, that (talking horse of the
French war-faflion, fnall we go on to re
turn evil for good, and to whet all their
refentmcnt to an edge ? We may thus ac
complilh the end our difaffe&ed party
have been long eagerly purfi ing, to make
almost all Europe our enemies. When
nations by mutual scorn and insult are thus
made to hate eaÂ«h other very heartily, the
ftionger will find it no hard matter to make
a pretence for a war upon the weaker
Our difaffe&ed haÂ«e done all they can to
furnifh them both the pretext and the in
clination. The public should mark it
nation,
well that tfte French emiflaries immediate
ly joined the party difaffe&ed to our own
government âfilled the newspapers with
abuse of our own officers, and even dared
to attack our firft magistrate, spared no
means to vent insults on the British, and
to give it the (hew of being the- sense of
America, courted flattery for themselves
and the ruling faction in France from eve
ry quarterâa&ually engaged American
citizens to wage war on the British trade,
and tampered with justice itfelf to get ju
ries to clear the offenders. They have
even dared to threaten us with the resent
ment of France, because we did not use
the force we have not got to repel the En
glish from searching our vessels, at the
very moment when the French themselves
in the face of their own treaty with Ame
rica are using us ten times worseâand to
make the insult to this country as morti
fying as our very Jacobins can bear, they
tell us if we cannot protest our own flag,
if we have not the spirit becoming an in
dependent government, to let them know
it and they will do it for us. The French
and those known to be in connection with
them, are the loudest in their clamours a
gainst the Englifli. If we are not to go
to war, why excite those resentments
which will render it difficult to restrain our
citizens ? They demand, are we to bear
every thing and to bear it always ? It is
answered.are we to quarrel with every na
tion that gives us any occasion ? France
has certainly offended us more cruelly than
a nation with whom we have no treaty, by
setting aside the only article of her treaty,
that is worth a farthing to America. Shall
we go to war with France ? O no, by no
meansâthey offer for her many excuses
and palliations ; and why ftiould not we
palliate the wrongs offered us by other na
tions, fmce we are not prepared nor dis
posed to go to war ? England alledges the
law of nations as a juftification for her ob
ftrufting our trade to France. Doubtless
if we chufe to have a war on our hands
we may have one without delay, and we
have fuffered wrongs, or at least can pre â 
tend we have fuffered enough from every
one of the powers now engaged to take
our choice whom we (hall quarrel withâ
observing however, that if we single out
an adversary we must expeÂ£t the whole
gang of his associates to fall upon us.
Judge therefore, of the difficulty of
keeping America from catching fire and
turning as Europe now does. We have
a, faction always preparing tinder and
watching an opportunity to strike fire.â
There has long been a clamor against the
commercial regulations of England.â
The Algerine business has enflamed the
rcfentments of many pcrfons, and the war
party fee that the opportunity is favorable
to set fire to the train they have been so
long preparing. It is proposed to forbid
all intercourse with Britain, or to impose
heavy {hackles on the intercourse with
that country. Is any one so (hallow as
qot to fee the consequence i Our language
has long been partial, if we proceed to
make our conduct partial also, it will be
war inevitably. The success of this pro
ject is to be dreaded, but I hope if we
are to have war, we fha'l chufe it, inllead

PHILADELPHIA,
JANUARY 15.
In my last of the Bth ult. I informed
you of the general rising to crufli the ef
forts of despotism at a blow, I now have
to inform you of some of the effects of
those vigorous measures. Hie Duke of
York is made prisoner, and has been con
ducted to Lisle. It has been proposed in
the Convention to expose him in Paris to
public view in an iron cage, in return for
the treatment which one of our deputies
at Toulon experienced from the Engliih,
and for the enormities committed in that
city.
One hundred and thirty deputies have
been arretted, several have been guillotined,
and others are under trial.
Valenciennes, Quefnoy, and Conde,
are evacuated. Furnes, Nieuport and
Malines are taken. Oflend is bombard
ed, and the port of this city is to be fdled
up when taken.
Our 44,000 municipalities are equip
ping each a horseman completely accou
tred. All our young men from 18 to 2y
years of age are marching towards the
frontier.
It is the intention of the National Con
vention to make all the defpote their ene
mies beg pardon, and humbly sue for peace.
The rebels in Vendee are exterminated ;
their leaders are taken. The army in that
quarter march to Toulon, which mutt soon
be retaken.
Lyons is taken, and is now called the
Freed City.
1 believe that overtures are to be made
for a offennfive and defenfive treaty with
the United States of America. I hope
they will not be found backward in this
business. Their existence as a republic
depends on our success. Gen. Adv.
A PROCLAMATION,
By the QUEEN of PORTUGAL.
Her mojl Faithful Majejly wijhing to

which aduates this court in all its a3s, has

navigation labours, from the cruisers of Al
giers in the ocean, to give a convoy to all
the American vejfels belonging to the United
States of A merica t which may be in her dif
ferent portSy and to be so proteQed to a propor
tionate di/lance. And moreover, has direct
ed the necejfary guarda cojtas to be sent out
for theproteQion of those vejfels expected, and
for this purpose tlye Algerine privateers that
may be met with, are to be apprifcd cf this
resolution, in order that they may not make
pri%es of such American vejfels which Jhe pro
tects y as being bound to the ports of this king
dom.
HENRY.
A Correspondent observes, that if the
United States (hould prohibit foreign ves
sels from taking off their produce, one
evident consequence mult result, and that
is, all competition in the market will be
cut offâWhether this will not for evsr
operate to the injury of the agricultural
interest, must be left to the wife men of
Gotham to determine.
A Correspondent would enquire, whe
ther the (hipping of the United States, is
not rapidly encreafingâ-Whether this in
crease must not neceflarily continueâand
whether this increase must not in a few
years and in the bett poftibk* way give us
that ascendancy, which to fay best,
we run the risque of poftponingtc a more
distant day, by attempting to grasp it bv
projects and experiments.

Vice-Admiral Sir John Jams' flag con

bible that he is to convoy the trade to the
iWeft-Ilidies ; but the idea of carrying an
armament there is certainly given up for
the prefer.?.

morning at fix o'clock with a very favora
ble gale, and mult nearly reach Oitend

DOVER, Oft. 29.
This morning pafled by to the Downs,
about 18 fail of transports, with 7000
troops on board, under convoy of two
frigates, bound from Portsmouth to Of

The gun-boats, which have remained
here fjnee the siege of Dunkirk, left this
harbor yeflerdav mjrning for Nieuport.
LONDON, October 30.
Jnft as this paper was going to ptefs,
we received addition to the intelligence
brought by our private letters from Of
teud, an account of the raising of the
siege of Maubeuge, which it is said, was
occasioned b)' the defeat of General Clair
fait, who w?s forced to cross the Sambre
in great precipitation. This defeat of the
Aiiftrian Genera! is alluded to in other
Oftend letters.
Although the account of the raising of
the siege was transmitted to us from moil
rrfpe&able authority, the want of time
has not enabled us yet to make such an
enquiry as would induce us to pledge our
fclves to the truth of the account.
It is determined, that 140 independent
companres are to be regimented, ten eom
pinies to a regiment. The field-officers
are to be taken from old regiments, Cap
tains to majors, m:\jors to be Lieute
nant Colonels, 4c. without purchases, and
their former commissions to be fold, the
produce of which is to be applied towards
the recroiting service.
Rai/ing of the Siege of Mauleuge
This intelligence was received from
Lord Elgin's brother, the Hon. Mr.Bruce
who is at Bmffels.
The French for several days past, had
made sallies from their entrenched campat
Maubeuge. As in many of those they
had been fuccefsful,it was resolved to make
a general attack on the division undergen.
Ckirfait.
The attack was conduced with such
force and perseverance, that Gen. Clair
fait was under the neceflity of dispatch
ing an aid-de-camp to the Prince of Saxe
Cobourg, him to advance im
mediately to his afliftance
The Prince of Saxe Cobourg accord
ingly crofTed the Sambre with his whole
army.
The afliftance which the Prince furnifh
ed to Gen. Clairfait, was not so efficaci
ous asto refill the torrent which the French
poirred upon the Allied army. It was
onlyiufficient to prevent Gen. Ciairfait's
army from being cut to pieces.
After a vigorous endeavour to drive the
French back to their entrenched camp,the
allied army found it neceflary to retreat,
and recrofs the Sambre.
The railing of the siege was the neces
sary and immediate consequence of this de
feat.
The Prince of Saxe Cobourg had two
horses killed under him.
The bad news, which was transmitted
to us yesterday, by an express that left
Oftend a day after the mail; but which
we did not think proper to publifli, left
we (hould give groundless alarm, was, that
the Duke of York had been obliged to
throw hirafelf, with his whole detachment
that was to reinforce the Prince of Co
bourg, into Valenciennes, where he was
said to be surrounded by the Frenchâ
One part of this we now find to be un
doubtedly true ; the other part, it is to
be hoped will not be confirmed, by the
letters which we impatiently expect from
the Continent, by the Flanders mail now
due.
NATIONAL CONVENTION.
October 16.
The Commtffioners aixl Secretary of
the diftricl of Louviere> for discovering
non-juring priests, wrote to the National
Convention, as follows :
" The genius of Liberty conduAed us
in the middle of the darkest night, to the
retreat of a non-juring priest, more than
sour-score years old, on whom we found
Jo pieces of gold of 24 livres, 65 piieces of
filvcr, of 6 livrss, stamped with the old
â¢mould, which formed the treasury of this
refractory obflinate man, with a gold watch
and a Manheim fnuff box, &c."
Second announced that he had found
out the means to direa balloons at plea
sure, and from tliis discovery he thinks the
enemy will receive great injury.âRefer
red to the Committee of Public instruc
tion, where Second will exhibit his disco
very.
Lacuro.be St. Michel, Commiflioner in
Coriica, wrote from Calvi, under date of
October i, that the Englilh, after having
cut off all communication by sea, had fum
moncd Baftia, and St. Florent, and were
determined to attack the latter place in
concert with Paoli, who directed the at
taek by land: but a violent storm obliged
the English to retire.âPaoli has been re
pulsed, and the Corficans have not been
more fuccefsful.
Saint Just made a report oh the law
against the English. The English, said
he, have violated towards us the Law of
Nations in an atrocious manner, and the
Decree against them is only a consequence
of that distrust with which the English
Government has justly inspired us. It is
wished that the law should extend to all fo
reigners. It is not evident that the more
numerous these whom we endeavor to in
timidate, the fewer we {hall in reality in
timidate ? We have not palled a law against
the English people, but against their go
vernment. Let England awake. We will
aflift her as friends to rid herfelf of Kings.
Since the English have maflacred the Re
presentatives of the People, at Toulon,
the House of Commons ought to tremble
for itfelf: the blow inflicted upon us strikes
against it. Thofc who wish that the law
(hould extend to other foreigners, do not
perceive that the other PowerÃ have not
the fame exclulive system with the English.
We ought to be in a state of revolution,
of force and of energy, against a people
who are in a state of treachery. It is by
force that we (hall conquer. Briflot de
ceived the Convention by philosophy. In
the present moment, they with to deceive
you by politics. The following is the
plan of the decree proposed by the com
mittee of public fafety.
Art. I. Foreigners bom fubjefts of the
powers, with whom the Republic is at
war, (hall be confined till the peace.
2. They (hall be treated with care.
3. Women married to foreigners, pre
vious to the law, are not included in the
decree, provided they are not fufpefted,
or married to fufpefted persons.
Chabot demanded that the conduct of
foreigners (hould be examined into, before
they were' confined, as there might be
found among them, persons of integrity,
and that a tribunal (hould be created for
that purpose. He ackuowledged that he
had espoused a foreigner, but that he was
not influenced by this consideration, and
that he was ready to facrifice nature to his
country.
Roberfpiere replied, that all foreigners
are fufpefted persons, that the most patri
otic are the most dangerous; that they
are the concealed agents of Austria, which
still keeps up a considerable faction in the
bosom of the Republic.âThe 3 ift of May
was fatal to the Anglo-Prussian faction.
The law against foreigners will be fatal to
the Austrian faction. This law is rigorous;
it will without doubt involve some valua
ble philosophers, but these are few and
besides the law is so magnanimous, that it
will find apologists even in those who are
affected by it.
Barrere.â" We {hall then have a per
fect Revolutionary law, namely, a law
without any exception. The Engli(h have
committed the most attrocious offence, by
maffacreing a Representative of the People,
and the infamy of that trar.faftion can only
be expunged by the ruin of England."- -
( Loud applause.)
Several exceptions were presented to
the preeeeding law; they were rejefled,
and the plan of the decree adopted. The
exceptions were referred to the Commit
tee of Public Safety.

fROlt A CORRF.SPO\'D rA' f
He who is more noisy than liis neigh
bors about his religion, will soon be let
down for a man that has none. It is a
lure mark of a defiguing hypocrite, who
wortld let up tlie (hew for the reality, and
make his market of the (hew. The lame
remark is applicable, and (hould be inva
riably applied to the political hypocritesâ
thole posture mailers, and makers of gri
mace, who would have the world rate the
merit of principles by the bluster of thole
who pronounce them. It is no hard mat
ter for a dozen frothy ranters to get to
gether, and, in effect to bully the still sen
sible, honelt people as much as they may
chufe. A Democratic club to make it's
resolves refpefted, Ihonld come forthâ
Who arc these men that would govern us
from their dark hoi â¢ , Are they superior
in light and information, in virtue, or cha
racter to other men ? if not, why do .they
take it upon them to di&ate as a body ?
A freeman may petition after having
elected rulersâthe pie Is is free. There
is no need of combinations and clubs. Let
us know who they are, that we may judge
what they are. It looks very like aristo
cracy, for persons of relllefs fiery spirits,
to cabal together, in order that their knot
may have more power and influence than
equal laws give to as many citizens who
quietly mind their business. Marius was
president of a Democratic club in ancient
Rome, afterwards Cataline and C'odius,
were members.

country, and it is not generally known who
arereturned. T. Dobfon, solicits the favor
of the subscribers to call or fend for their vo
lumes, that they may be supplied as early as
po/fible.
The tsnth volume o! the Encyclopedia is
now presented to the public ; but as it makes
it) appearance in an iinperfcft ftatc, some ac
count ot the real'on of that imperfection Ihould
a the September last, the
rublijher had the misfortune of having his
Printing-office burnt down by a fire which
btoke out in the neighbourhood, and a great
quantity Â«>f his printing materials deftroved
and among other articlos, the riounES, with
which he was printing the tables or lo
garithms, belonging to the present volume,
were melted down by the violence of the fire.
As a supply of these could not be immediately
ebtained, he was under the neceflity of pub
' n g the volume without the:e tables; but
hopes he (hall be ahle to publilh them with the
next volume which is now in considerable for
wardnefs.
The Publisher embraces this opportunity of
exprelling his grateful acknowltdgments to
the generous public, for the very liberal pa
tronage with which his undertaking has been
honored; at the fame rime he takes the li
berty of representing to f'uch of the fubfci ibers
[ as are in arrears, the indifpenfible neceflity of
punctuality, both in takinj up ihe volumes as
early as pofHble after publication, and of pay
ing for them when taken. Many of the fub
(bribers having got only one, two, three, &:c.
volumes, and several volumes remain unpaid
Thus the work hangs in all its different ltages
from the commtmemunt; and though the im
portance of a few dollars may be but a trifle
to the individuals, yet the accumulation of
these trifles unpaid lays the Publilher under
very serious emharraflment, and deprives him
of the ule of many Thonfands of Dollars which
at this time would be of verv eflential service
For these reasons the Publilher finds himfelf
under the neceflity of recurring to the original
terms of nublication, and in future no vo
lumes will be delivered but only to those who
take and pay to the time ot publication.
