The SPEECH of Mr. Smith, of South-
Carolina, in reply to Air. Madison, on
the fubjeft of the Commercial Regulations.
Qcontin u^d]
We receive rom Britain,' said the gen
tleman, whatever (he pleased to fend us,
while fne refufed our principal staple.
Mr. Smith denied both these positions;
they were not founded in any sense.
I. The staple alluded to was flour and
grain. This the regulations of Britain
excluded fiom her home markets, except
in safes of extraordinary demand, but in
her V/ejl-India markeii the staple wasfree,
so that the afiertion was much too gene
ral. Our flour and grain were admitted
in those of her markets where perhaps it
most interested us that they should be,
where the demand was constant; they
were fuÃject to impediments in thofc of
her markets, where the demand would,
from the nature of things, be only occa
fioaal; while Franee, 011 the contrary, by
her permanent system, received this arti
cle only in her home markets, where there
could be no demand for it in ordinary
times, and excluded it from her Weft-In
dia markets, where there would be a con
flant demand.
2. It was not true that we received in
discriminately the manufactures of Bri
tain. We endeavor to exclude in the
fame sense, that (he excludes our (lour &
grain (viz by prohibitory duties) all such
of them as we think ourielves able to sup
ply ourselves with, for instance, candles,
cTieefe, soaps, nails and fptkes, steel, ca
bles and cordage, boots and /hoes, and
indeed the manufa&uies of leather gcne
rally, beer and porter, and many other
articles.
The gentleman was ajlonilhed at the
vast prevalency of British manufactures in
the United States* But there was no
ground for adonifhment to th'ofe who at
tended to fads. Tue tiue and natural
rcafon was, because Britain furniftied bet
ter as to quality and price than any other
country, mod of the more solid and ufe
ful kinds of manufacture and those of the
mo(t extensive coniumption ; generally
speaking, (he was rivalled elsewhere only
in luxuries and fripperies. Mr. Smith
said, if the gentleman had been adonifhed,
he had been no less so, at the idea of ex
cluding Britifli luxuries tor French manu
factures ; from the bed information he
had obtained, the mod solid and ufeful ar
ticles came from Britain, the frivolous,
luxurious and unneccflary ones from
France : He had procured from a mer
chant trading with France, a copy of an
order for a French cargo, such as is usual
ly sent, and it supported him in his afler
tion. Mr. Smith read the order, which
confided of, fans, cambrics, lawns, lute
drings, modes and fattins, silk dockings,
shoes, shoe-patterns and flippers, walking
canes, watches, feathers and flowers,
gloves, laces and edgings, ribbons, tiffa
ny,* crape, hair powder, human hair for
braids, combs, essences, perfumery, sweet
meats, mirrors, made up millenary, gold
and (liver thread and spangles, gold and
filvercord, ornamented fancy timepieces,
silk velvets, umbrellas, &c. These were
the JubJlttules for tlie manufa&ures of iron,
wool, cotton and leather, which the gen
tleman wiihed to exclude, by the duties
contemplated in his propositions.
The balance of trade was said to be a
gaind us in our trade with Britain, and
in our favor with other nations. Mr.
Smith said, the ide<is advanced as to this
point were of the lad century, and were
now exploded by all enlightened politici
ans. The only sense in \vhich the quedi
on could be intereding to us, refpe&ed
the balance of o(ir whole trade with all
the VforLl, not with a particular country.
It was immaterial whether it was againd
us in this country or in our favor with
that, the enquiry should be, how it dood
upon the whole ; and for it to dand well
upon the whole, the bed expedient, as it
regarded our internal commerce was, to
get what we want, where it could be ob
tained cheaped and bed, and to have as
great a choice of markets as v pofiible for
what we have to fell, by which means we
secure the bed price.âMeasures tending
to change this course of things were the
bed that could be devised to render the ag
gregate balance disadvantageous to this coun
try.
Mr. Smith illustrated his positions by
the following (latement : Suppose the
whole amount of our imports to be as 200,
Britain fumifliing 150, France, 50;
Suppose our exports also equal to 200,
Britain taking 150, France, 50 ; here
the balance of our whole trade, according
to the rule adopted, would be equal.
Suppose Britain furniOied her manufac
tures 10 percent cheaper than France, &
that regulations were adopted, which
(hould have the effect of equalizing our
exports and imports to and from both
countries j Britain in this cafe would fur
nifh only one half of our imports, which
would coll us the fame as before, but
France would have to furnilh us with an
additional quantity equal to what cod in
Britain formerly jo, but as commodities
with her by the supposition, are 10 per
cent, dearer, the fame supply would now
cojt 55 ; our account of imports and ex
ports would then stand thus :
IMPORTS.
From Britain . - 100
From France former supply' 50
Additional f'ipply of 50 iranf-
poÂ»tcd from Britain, coll-
ing 10 per cent. more.
Here it is evident the excess of imports
to exports on the fame scale of supply
would be as Jive, so that what is called
the balance of trade, before equal, would
now be turned against us in the proporti
on of Jive.
Thus the notable plan forgiving us a
more favorable balance of trade, would
end in rendering it less favorable, by di
verting us from thole sources where we
can get supplied on the best terms, to
others where we fliould be supplied on
worse terms.

It is wholly unnecefiary to expatiate on the
advantage,to American readers, that this edi
tion possesses, over every imported edition of
any fyfte nof Geography extant. The addit
tion of maps of the several ftate>, procured a
a very great expense, and from the best mal
terials that are attainable, speaks such ful
conviction on this fubjeft, that it would be
difrefpeft to the reader's understanding to
suppose it requisite to enter into a detail of
arguments to prove its superiority. In noj
similar work have such maps beenever intro
duced.
The emendations and additions which are
made in this work,are innumerable, and occur
in every page. The public are referred to
the preface for a (light (ketch of a few of
them.
The publisher takes the present opportu*
nity of returning his most sincere thanks to
those refpr&able characters who have favored
him with documents for improving the maps
of several of the states. He requests a conti

public spirited citizens, as are poilcfled of si

a&ltance in perfecting his undertaking.
The extraordinary encouragement with
which he has been favored, has excited
in hisbreaft the warmed sentiments of grati
tudeâ sentiments which time will not efface.

AN ESSAY ON THE

Aliquid Temper ad communcm utilitatem af
fcrcnduin. Cicero.
The F'trjl American Edition.
THE grand principle of" Equality, if right
ly underltood, is the only basis on which
universal justice, sacred order, and perfedt
freedom, can be firmly built, and permanent
ly secured. The view of it exhibited in this
efTay, at the fame time that it reprefles the
insolence of office, the tyranny of pride, and
the outrages of oppreflion ; confirms, in the
mofl forcible manner, the neceflity oi" subor
dination, and the just demands of lawful au
thority. So far indeed, from loosening the
bands of society, that it maintains inviolate,
every natural and every civil diftin&ion,
draws more closely every social tie, unites in
one harmonious arid justly proportioned sys
tem, and brings men together on the even
ground of the inherent rights of human na
ture, of reciprocal obligation, and of a com
mon relation to the community.
