themfeha into a Jlalt of nttarchy, debili

You will fieafr to give them a place in

THESE Writers impute the oppofit ion
which it made to the formation of, what
they call " Republican Societies," to the
moniedpart of the peopleâand to the No
bUity. Who they allude to, by the nobili
ty in this country, I cannot divine. And
who iÂ« meant by the monied part, whtre
property is so equally divided as in Ame
rica, is inconceivable. Some of them have
Called upon the farmers, &e. to guard a
gainst these monied people- I âThe fact iÂ»Â»
that njoe tenths of the property of the
United States, is in the hands of the far
mersâthey are called upon therefore in
this cafe to guard against themselves.â
it is said, " the only reason why the mo
tiied part of the people oppose these so
cieties is because a great many of them
have crept into offices. What.is this,
fwt a reprefentatiuflof our civil officers,
us a mercenary crey.âObferveâ" they
have crept into offices." It is a new
iflea, that our civil officers who are cbo
fen by the free fuffrages of the people,
have crept into office, i. e. got in by some
mercenary or underhand method. Not
fatijfied, however, with representing them
io this contemptible light, they are exhibi
ted as an associated band of enemies to
the people, as being jealofls lett the peo-
pie obtain political knowledge eiuiugh tu
iolpeit their wicked and inimical proceed
ings, which, they lay, " they are doubt
ful will not (land the test." What a de
t eft able abuse of our civil rulers is this ?
Have they given occasion for such black
calumny ? Can we patiently hear those
worthy char afters, whom we hive choÂ»
fen to tranfaft our public business, tra
duced, when, as yet, we have found no
cause of complaint in their administra
tions. These writer* Ccem to have consi
dered themselves at the head of - an armed
fa&ion, under some corrupt monarchical,
oratiflocratical government, ready to (hike
8 most fatal blow. Their language can
be.applicable in no other cafe. And can
the citizens of America endure, without
indignaiioit, such unreasonable abuse, not
only of their civil officers, but of them
selves also ? They are represented as hav
ing been so duped in giving their fuffia
goa, as that they have chosen enemies,
alfd men of the moil corrupt and aban
doned principles.
Â£>oes jiot the complexion of this lan-
guage too plainly manifeil the spirit by
which these societies are a (filiated ? Can
that fee a good spiritâa spirit of true li
berty which influences men to publish
such vise and slanderous libels? Rather,
is it not the spirit of anarchy, and ought
it not for the peace and happiness of so
ciety, to be fupprcfled immediately, or to
be treated with such general contempt,
as that it may fink into its deptaved in
fignificance ? It seems by the spirit of
these writers that they want nothing but
anarchy and the guillotine to have business
enough in taking off the heads of those,
whom they fay " are keeping the people
in ignorance lead: they hurl them from
their easy situations." Such writers mud
be informed that the people of this coun
try are at present unwilling to involve
themselves in anarchy and eonfufion, or
to drag, without trial, our civil rulers to
to the Place de la Revolution,âor to burn
the bible, âor to commence atheills,âor
to aboliili tin' Â£a\>bath ; and that there
fore their inflammatory productions are
uitfeafonable:â-Frobibly, in France such

LONDON, March 4.
The elevation of count Browne de Ca
mus, to the chief command of the Impe"
rial army on the Rhine, having excited
the public curiosity, tht following parti
culars may not be unacceptable i
Descended of a very ancient family in
Scotland, count de Browne Was born in
the year 1744, at Riga, wheffc his father,
a field marshal in the service of Ruflia,
and commandant of the Province of Li
vonia, is ft ill alive. His mother is sister
to field marshal Lafey. Count Bro\#ne
pofTefles a very large fortune, which he
employs in the moll worthy manner upon
all occasions. His military knowledge
extends to every branch of the art of war,
and his attachment to the sovereign whom
he serves is not inferior to the fidelity
which his illustrious uncle, the commander
in chief, always (hewed towards the House
of Austria.
It has been said that our laws are so ad
mirably balanced, that they provide an ade
quate remedy for every injury which a man
can possibly fnftain. This axiom is ad
mirably illliftrated by the statute against
dog-stealing, where it is ena&ed, that the
pdrty offending in such a cafc, shall be
publicly whipped, but added, that if he
thinks himfelf aggrieved, he may after
wards appeal for remedy, at, the Quarter
Sessions ! !
On Thursday last, a couple being out
aflced, at St. Ann's, Soho, came to be
married, and when the clergymen came to
that part of the ceremony which dire&s
that the woman shall be supported in sick
ness and in health, the bridegroom, in a
joke, said to the clergyman, " What shall
I do with her if (he should be lame or la
zy i" Upon which the clergyman refufed
to proceed with the ceremony, and the
disappointed couple were obliged to defer
their nuptuals to a more convenient season.
adtion is unnecessary. Suffice it to fay,
that perhaps had the worthy clergyman
ex populated with the bridegroom, the un
lucky incident might have ended much
better than it did. Whether they have
since been married we cannot learn.
The accounts from Botany Bay men

A Portuguese frigate tool lately into
the port of Lisbon, from Madeira, a rich
French East Indiaman. The court of ad
miralty of Liibon has declared her a fair
prize, in consequence of the French hav
ing captured four Portuguese veflels, whiqh
they carried into the port of New-York.
Accounts from Petersburg mention,
that on the 25th of January last, the ice
of the river Neva was suddenly broken by
a violent hurricane which blew from fei.
This caused an inundation never experi
enced before in that metropolis. No ac
cident happened, on account of the inha
bitants having received notice, by a gener
al discharge of artillery.
Letters from Constantinople, inform
us, that the sublime Porte seems very much
inclined to listen to the offers made by the
rebellious Mahmoud Baftiaw ; the latter,
after having defeating the troops which
the Porte sent against him, has written a
letter to the Grand Signior full of protes
tations of fidelity and submission, offering
to pay the arrears he owed to the Ottoman
government, provided he is allowed to
continue in his situation as Bashaw.

DUBLIN, Feb. 25. 1
A very uncommon circumstance lap.
pÂ«ned yesterday to the child of one Jtorke,
of Thomas-street. A boy about 7 years
of age, who had charge of an infant, went
to fifh m the Reservoir that fupplieg the
town with water. Just as the pipes were
opened, in consequence of a fire that broke
out tn Bridge-street, he happened to let
l>Ls fitter fall, who was precipitr.ted thro'
tlx; pipes, and.ivas afttially carried into the
anna of one of tlve fire men where the wa
ter had vent. The infant was apparently
dead ; but co marks having aj. peared ol
receiving any injury, except luffocatio:.,
and a surgeon in the street having treated
it accordingly, the child was rertored to
life by the means recommended to recover
drowned perlons by the Humane Society*
From the Reservoir to Bridge-lb cet is
more than an English mile.

The Indian Chief has been captured by a
French Ihip of war, on her voyage from
England, because Ihe had a few staves on
The George Barclay escaped the fame
ate, by something lite a miracle ! During
ler voyage from Philadelphia to England,
n December last, Ihe was hailed in the Bri
ifh Channel by a French frigate. The Capt.
â¢xamined her manifeft, and exprefled his
"atisfaclion that several articles, which lie
enumerated, were not on board ; otherwise
he should' have been obliged to capture the
veflel. Among the reft, he mentioned staves.
There were staves in the vefffl, but they had
at firft by mistake, been forgot in making
out the manifeft, and were, after it hid been
signed, indorsed on the back of it.
This trifling mistake laved the (hip, as the
Frenchman did not think of turning to the
other fide of the paper.

ILxtraSl from the slibuny Gazette.
A short sketch of the debates in the house
or representatives, the latter end cf last
month (which appear in some of the late
newspapers J in of some com
munications of the depredations of the Bri
tifli cruisers on the commerce and navigation
of the United States, gives us a picture of so
much warmth, passion and intemperance
that it ieems nothing short of an immediate
declaration of war against that power, will
abate the. rage of certain trading gentlemen,
members of that house.
Then huzza for speculation, privateering
â¢ind the acquirement of monstrous fortune
by a hop, step and jump : but these fiuious'
gentlemen ought to be apprised, that forcine
the country into a war with such violent
precipitation, is no way to command, (what
must be deemed very efll-mial) the fuppVt
of the great body of the people.
Nor is it probable, that Britain as a nation
can be very desirous of a rupture with this
country at present.
She has full tmploy in her war with
France, and I am therefore of opinion, that
with suitable negociatioii, reparation may
yet be obtained â¢ and the calamities these
gentlemen wiftt so haitily to plunge us into
ivoided.
Every country on going to war, hath ee
nerally some advantage in profpeft to be de
rived, as a compensation for its loft of blood
and treasure, and the devastation she mull
experience in its progreft; but in the name
of health, let me alk, What are we to gain >
Have we a fleet to enrich ourselves bv clo
tures at sea ? Are the United States in want
of territoi y ? Canada, and the beggarly pro
vince of Nova Scotia, both a great incum
brance to and *which she Would be
glad to be rid of, can be the only objects of
our conquest, and are they worth possessing
after we get them: Hence it follows, that
for the gratification of certain favorite filer*
chants, who have sustained lofles by the Bri
tifli cmizers, when at the fame time, we
have property in our hands of perhaps twen
ty times the amount of their losses, belong
ing to the fubjetfs of Britain ; this great ex
tensive but defienctiffs republic, is to be hur
ried into a war, which if instantly gone into,
will be justly entitlcd'tg the appellation of the
Merchants luar: howevt., the farmers by
a land tax, wili have to bear the great bur
-ihetl of tbe enprX\rp in' rarryinff rtn
To conclude, -God forbid that these Uni
ted States fliould follow the ridiculous fop
pery of the nations of Europe, in going to
war upon the moil trifling and frivolous pre
tences.
A war therefore, of this nature not hav
ing either the honor, the happi Ã efs or the
glory of the United States for its object, will
not meet with the approbation of
An Otfrgo F irmtr.

EXTRACT-
Frcquentlya preamble is affixed tohwj,
which gives the reason of enabling them;
to this adi Â£the Embargo RefolitJthere
is no preambleâlf there was, and the rea
son of palling the ast was what had been
cotiGdercd, it would read thus: " Where
as the owners of ships, seamen, merchants,
and those coiicerncd in insuring property
at sea, have become so infatuated with
fa lie prufpefts of gain, and so blinded to
their own inter eft and fafety, that they fub
je& their perfous and their estates to haz
ard* and lofies, incoufiftent with prudence,
and which no citizcn has a ntfht to when
it is confdcrjd that the loss of each indi
vidual is a los to the country at large ; and
whereas Congrcfs, moved with pity and
compassion for their blindness and perverfe
nefs, and feeing their inability any longer
to regulate their affairs, and sensible that it
is better that the aforcfaid defcriptioos <jf
citizens (hnuld be subjected to idlencfs; the
produce of the country to loss for want of
a market, than they permitted to progre:*
in their mad career, of fending their per
sons and property abroad, do enadt that
an embargo &c. See."
Such a preamble would hardly comport
with the wisdom of Congress, or the feel
ings of the citizens. If the motives that
produced this ast be what some have pre
tended, this preamble would do no moifl
then state the truth to the worldâwe
ought therefore to impute it* origin to
other caufcs.
It was stated in yefterdav's Garette, that
the bill providing for the payment of inter-;
eft on the balances due to several of the State*
on the sinai filtleijunt of accounts betwef
the United States and individual States, had
pafled the House of Representatives.
This fcufinefs has mgoffed a ecnliderabV i
portion of the time of the Hp-feâ gr
it appears that the ohje" was cTen:iilly re
c opt: zed by a law paflfed at the lalt feflion
Of Congreft. In the course of difeu fling the
fubjeift, fundrv amendments wi!rc proposed ;
among others it was nuved ta, exonerate
the Debtor States from any obligation to
cifcharge the balancej refpc<stively reported
]by the Comnvffioners as due from them;
this motion was, after lome. deba:e. nega
tiveâsi to 13 âAnother proposed amend
nundment was, that the payment ot the 111-
tci-clt On fald balances, cui of the laid funds,
cease and deteini: 11- aft* the year 1798, and
that thereafter the balances due from certain
fcates as reported by the COl uu.i iione rs, be
appropriated to the payment of the princi
pal and Interest of the balances due to said
llateÂ»; this amendment wis lost â60 to 17â
cq the queCton lor engrolTing, yeas 51, nays
17âA motion that it be read the third time,
on the ift October, was,negatived, 51 to 33.
The bill provides that intL-refl be allowed
from the last day of December 1789, and
to be computed to the last day ot December
1794, at the rate of 4 per cent, per annum;
the amount of such interest to be placed to
the credit of the Hate to which the fame
foall be found due upon the books of the '
'J reafurv of the United States, and (hall
bear an' interest of 3 per cent, per annum
froth and after the fa id last day of Decem
- 1794 âthe said interest to be paid quarter
yearly, at the refpedtive loan offices ; the
iirft payment to be made oh the last day of
March 1795â To be paid out of the duties
oa imports and tonnage, not heretofore ap
propriated; and the .aith of the United
States iÂ« pl-.dged to provide for any deficien
cy that may happen; by such additional
and permanent funds as may be ncceflary
therefor.
From the Augnjla Chronicle.
From the manoeuvre and heat which
took place last Saturday, to pass the ref
lations which appeared in the second page
of the last Southern Centinel, and to sup
press, even the reading of those, which
are inserted immediately after, in the fame
paper, I conceived that the latter mull
have, at lea ft, favoured of pufilanimlty,
or. that, at least, they must have been of
a very milky texture ; âbut, on peruful, J
v. : a much furprifedtofind, that thejfyle is
the only material difference between the
two, and, that to convey the sentiments
of the neighborhood in the most violent
and {trained language, in preference to a
firm and decent expression, was the great
bone of contention. For although, at
firft fight, it may appear, that the feature
of the one is war, and of the other,
peace ; vet, when wrttdveiTTÃ llif con
ditions in the latter, that peace was not
hoped or wished for, but on honorallc
terms, and conlider, that these terms, be
ing undefined and left to the judgment of
that body, who only of right, can judge
of them ; I fay, they would have included
the very object So zealously prefTed by the
majority, I mean, " the withdrawing of
the Britifli fleets and armies from molest
ing the Republic of France as thÂ» price of
peace; if, luch a measure (hould be con
templated by the Congress of the United
States in the fame point of view as by
the fticklcrs for-this implied umpirage,
â  âwhether it is. or not, the du
ty of that body, so to consider it, we
shall for the present, leave to the bold dis
quisitions of bold politicians; and only
observe that it is a kind of language
which no modern power is in the habit
of â¢using, except the Czars or Czarinas of
all the Russias: As to the sequestration
clause which blends the situation of those
who have fled to this country as an asy
lum, and are not, nor cannot, until a
certain d finite probation, become citizens,
with that of Britith citizens and residents
having property or debts in this country ;
âfor the honor of humanity, I will not
conclude, that any opposition would have
been made to that discriminatory provi
sion in the resolves, (prevented from be
ing brought into view on the day of dif
culTion,) which draws a proper diltinc
tien between persons in these different
predicaments.
In as much as the purpose of meeting
was to express the general opinion on the
present crisis of affairs, I cannot compre
hend the applicability of resorting to the
recapitulation of grievances which do not
concern ue, much less to give the firft
place in the lift of political crimes to the
naval and military preparations" of the
Britilh nation. From the general maxim
that the over-violent are always fufpe&ed,
I am puzzled to find out the policy in this
instance (where ftifpicion with refpeel to
many of the charafilers concerned, cannot
possibly obtain J of framing their opinions
in fach a manner as rather to resemble the
(hallow fubterfuge of that vociferous de
clamation which is often adopted by du-
plicity,. than the raw!)' and .canJid lir.ti
tnents of fineere patriotism.

FROM THE CENTJN^L.
THE INS and OUTS.
Mr. Russell,
THE outs of .England never were i.iore
iiuliifliious to fifed! changes . : n their v.rn
ment than the ouis of the United .jiales
have been assiduous to get /V -evt . the
expenfeof the Peace Happ:Â«iefÂ» ;ird r'r;<f;.er
ity of the Union. Dilcipl.s of ;vL: h.fvel,
they deem any-meafure right, tin. tficds
their end. Hence the itieams of abuse,,
which have (Â°. r .years flowed so
from certain fout;ce6.to overwhelm tht- jK
putation of every administrator of the Fe
deral Government, chosen by the people,
from the downwards.â
Hence too the rapid circulation of cabal and
falfeintelligenceâdeclamation and bellow
ingâto warp the mmds of the people from
the pursuit of the things which lead to
their felicity. But in almost every event,
good rises out of evil: The party have
of far the " mantle" which cover
ed its deformity, that the " cloven foot"
has been discovered ;andthepeople,-convin
cedofthe" nature ofthebeaft," have been
on their guard agai ift its machinations.â
The party appeared envious of the grow
ing prosperity of the country âand as a war
they knew will prove its deltruftioriâall
theirarts and intrigues have tended to that
point. In this, under guise of high-mind
ed patriotism, they have effeÂ£hial'y copied
the -wiles of Manarchsâwho wlkh a na
tion grows so rich as " waxing fat to tick ; v
they conjure lip a war. What fays that
enemy to the arts of King craft, Dr. Wal
cott ? In some late pathetic Odes, he touch
es, in his way, on the fubjeft of this para
graph ; and thus emphatically prays :
And now God blefi once more good
Mister Pitt,
Who for invention beats nineteen in
twenty ;
And may this gentleman's mod ready
wit
Supply the nation all with taxes plenty ;
And as the kingdom has unclench'd its
fid,
Pick out a few odd pence for Civil Lift.
We are too richâDame Fortune
grows too fancy;
Wealth is inclin'd to Tie tonfounded

War is a wholesome blister for the back;
Drawing away the humours all so

Else would the Empire be of gutg a

By this Day's Mail.
BALTIMORE, May 15.
Yesterday morning arrived here, the ship
Chefapeak, Captain William Wife in 52
days from Amsterdam. On the 22d of
March, off the Goodwin Sands, Capt.
W. was boarded by an English frigate,
who previous to the boardiug of him, fired
several Ihot, and caried away part of "his
stern ; the only rcafon given for firing so
often was, that Capt. W. did not round
too in an instant; the Chefapeak was go
ing at that time at the rate of 12 knots.
The firft Lieutenant came on board, and
after examining Capt. Wife'* papers, dif
mirted him, wilhing him a fafe passage
The Lieutenant informed Capt. W. that
war would shortly be declared against the
Danesâand not any neutral vessel was per
mitted to pass the Downs, without under
going an examination, and if any part is
provisions, they are taken into England.
On the 26th of March, Capt. W. was
boarded by the Thames (French) frigate,
who had been from Brsft 20 days, mid
had with her at that time 10 prizes, chief
ly laden with provisions, and weie all
standing in for Brest, and as they were
favored with a fair breeze for three days
after, Capt. Wife, makes no doubt of
their fafe arrival at Bredâthe lieutenant
of the Thames informed Capt. W. that
,j tJie.'e Were 4 French frigates e ruffing for
! a fleet of 60 fail of Englifli merchant
men, that were coming round the Lands
end, bound up the channel, which they
exp.cteJ to fall in with that nightâhe
likewise informed Captain W. that the
Fiench were every where fuceefsfulâand
provl'ions were plentyâCapt. Wife fur
ther informs 113 that there was not an
English cruifcr to h â  seen in the channel
below Doverâbut tk t they were in a
manner, furroimdecj b/ the French.
Yesterday arrived in 29daysjfrom Mont
ferrat, the brig Success, captain Beard.
Tjic Succrfs in her paflage from Guada
lotTpc to Baltimore, was captured by a
Bfitifh privateer and carried into Mont
ferrat, but liberated after paying costs.â
O 1 the 12th and 14th of April about xi
fa.l of American vefTels were liberated at
Moatferrat. Americans were liberating
at St. Kitts, Dominica, and Antigua, un
der the order from the court of St. James's
of the Bth of January ; the judge of the
admiralty paying no attention to admiral
Jervis's declaration of the Frcneh i(lands
being in a state of blockade, since his ar
rival 11 the Weft Indies.
By a letter, dated Montferrat, April
15, we learn, that Mr. Burke, folicitor
general of Antigua, wrote a very severe
letter to the king's council on the fubjedl
of liberating American veflels,, which had
such a powerful effeÂ£t on the judge, that
he liberated every American veflel in the
port which came under the older of the
Bth of January.
Ycftfrday evening arrived, ih 15 days
from Havanna, the (hip Citizen, Captain
CunninghamâBy this veflel we learn,,
that a Spanish fleet of merchantmen, chief
ly laden with sugar, was expected to fail
from that port for old Spain in about fix
days after her departure, under a convoy
of two letters of marqueâand that an
embargo took place on the 30th Ult.
Capt. Buck, who came pafienger in the
Citizen, was carried into the Havanna,
and his cargo condemned while in con
finement. A Captain from Philadelphia
and another from New-York met with
similar treatment. Captain Cunningham
spoke a veflel from Jamaica, the master
of which informed him, that American
beef fold at 30 dollars per barrel in that
i(land.

The Public are cautioned to
beware of counterfeited Five Dollar Bills of
the Bank of the United States, and Twenty
Dollar Bills of the Bank of North America,
several of tahiTh ha ve appeared in circulation
Â» quit bin a feiu days pafl; they are a good ge
e neral imitation of the genuine Bills, but may
11 be dijlinguijhed by the following
MARKS.
â jFive Dollar Bills of the Bank of the
United States.
ALL that have appeared havs the letter F.
for their Alphabetical Mark.
Q The Texture of the Paper is thicker and
whiter and it takes the ink more freely than
r. the genuine paper.
The O. m the word Company is frfialler
( e than the M. and other letters of that word,
so that a line extended from the top of the O,
to touch the top of the M. would extend con
fideiably above the range of the whole word.
In the word United the letters are narrow
erand closer together than the reft of the bill
Â® The i and fin the word promise are not
parallel, the y'inclining much more forward
than the i.
The engraving is badly cxecuted,the strokes
iV of all the Letters are Wronger and the device
in the margin particularly is much coarfcr and
J appears darker than in the true bills. Some
ol the counterfeits bear date in 1-91âWhere
as the Bank was not in operation till Decern
ber, and 110 five dollar bills were illued in
t ihat year.
Twenty Dollar Bills of the Bank of North
t America.
e ALL that have appeared have the letter
, B tor then alphabetical inai k.
'Â» Tiiey are printed on a puper neatly fimilav
e to that of the counterfeit Five Dollar Notes
above defenbed ; the engraving is bote* Â£xe
ucted, and they approach nearer to the ap
pearance of the genuine bills.
The fine ruled lines through the word Tnen
(v, in the body of the bill, are in number thir
teen in the genuine bi]U s and but twelve in
the counterfeit *.
The \void Company is much like the fame
/ word in the Five Dollar bills Â«.s defer ibed a
t bove, the 0 being ieis than the m, and others
following.
There is no stroke to the t in the word Forth
whereas in the genuine bill's the stroke is well
defined.
The letters ent in the word la'W/j, to the
left hand at the bottom, do no: come down to
1 the line, but are so cut-as to give an irregular
appearance to the word,,the Jui and ihej- go
ing below them.
The signature |. Nixon, has the appear
ance of Ining written with lamb-black and
01, and d liters troth other inks uicd in
printing the bills and the cashier's signature.
It ivfuppofed thefc forgeries weie committed
in 10me of thÂ« Southern btates, as all the coun
terfeits thai have appeared, have come from
