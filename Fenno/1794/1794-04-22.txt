HUMANE SOCIETY.
At a late meeting of the TrusteeS o
the Humane Society, information of the
following event given to them, and
fully authenticated.
On the 26th ps March last, about I
o'clock, P.M. as Mr. Stephen Twiftand
Mr. Hopeftill Bradlee, both furthers of
the GarriCon at the Castle, were fiihing in
a small c#noe, between I.ong-Ifland head
and the east point of Speftatle-Iflatid,
they Were fuddtnly overtaken with a hea
vy squall of wind, which induced them
to attempt gaining the shore \<?ith all pof
ilble speed. While they were endeavor
ing to accompli fh this, against an high
sea and a severe fret of wind, they descri
ed something at the distance of two or
three hundied yards from them, which
they soon concluded to be the head of a
man. They instantly determined to go
to his relief, hazardous as the attempt
was ; and tacking about soon came near
him. Here they paused for a moment,
and with great presence of mind required
from the man an absolute and sacred prfl
mife, that he would not attempt to toufch
their canoe except in the manner which
they fllould prefcri'oeâas seizing it iiji
prudf ntly might destroy them as well V.3
himielf.
This prctr.ife he made themâand wfytn
they nrae to him he defiit'd them to saVe
his little son, of about fix years i;ld,whora
he was holding 111 his arms. Him they
took in at the head of the canoe. Mv.
Twist then turning it round.and dii'eqt
fng Bradlee with the child to lie down in
the head, he drew the man gently into the
canoe, at the stern, and then for the
shore of Speftacle-lfland, wliicn, nctwith
ftanding tfie violence of the wind, they
reached in fafety. Here they were re
ceived by the people of the I(land with
the utmost "kindness and hospitality, and
after di'.ers applicatlpns the child, who
appeared perfeft'y dead when brought on ,
shore, was restored to animation.
The persons saved, were Mr. Thomas
Barnes of this town, and. his son. Mr.
Barnes relates, that the boat in wliich he
and his ftsn with Mr. Wiliam Brown and
Mr. John Dailey (both alfo.of this town)
were, was funk at the firft coming up of
the squall; that he caught his son as the
boat was finking,,and providentially fe;zed
the top of the mad, (which was two feet
under water) with one handâby this he
held fact, while he clasped his child to his
bosom with the other. In this fituatiou
he remained more than half an hour, be
fore the canoe came to his relief. The
two men, Mr. Brown and Mr. Daily, at
tempted to swim to Long-Island, but fail
ed in the attempt, and were both drown
ed.â
TheTruftees gave to Mr.Twi(l> (who
was principally active in the bufijiefs) a
reward of ten dollars; and to Ms:,
lee a reward of five dollarsâlor their
lial exertions on this occafior. âani direct
ed this account to be published to their
honor, to induce others to imitate'the-hu
manity, enterprise, and prudence cf these
worthy men.

BASLE, Jan. 24.
Previous to the famous affair of Ger
(lieim, the utmost discontent prevailed a
mongst the armies. The Auftrians ac
eufed the Pruflians of hanging back, and
leaving them foremoft to the fire of the
enemy. The Piuflians retorted the
charge. The Saxons quarrelled with the
Bavaiiaus, and the Heflians accused the
Palatines of cowardice. In this state of
things, the French continually harrafling
them, and a dearth of liquor taking place
(a gill of spirits fold for twelve sols) the
Auftrians were benumbed with cold, and
saw she French soldier enjoying his bottle
with every comfort that the season requi
red. A general discouragement and num
berless desertions were the consequence.
At length, the French stormed the
batteries at Gerfheim, the molt formida
ble that have been ever known ; three
tiers of artillery, the guns placed "en \
Cremaillitrc," so as to produce a triple
line of crossed fire, and the whole well
manned ; but what cannot bravery do !
The line broke, the French fell upon the
Combined Troops with the bayonet.
For fix hours the French never ceased
killing with the bayonet, without firing a
fi.ot; fatigue obliged them to halt; the
defer tcrg arrived in hundreds.
The French, fi:ill pursuing arrived at
the lines of Weiffembourg, where in ad
dition to the immense capture of baggage
ti:ey found all the artillery they had iolt (
at this place, together with an enormous
magazine of powder, destined for the
siege of Landau ; a part of the allies re- I
serve artillery was also abandoned at Lau
terbonrg. The Auftrians had the barba
rity to place a lighted fueee to blow up
the magazine, though they had left near
1500 of their wonnded in the town, and
near tooo prisoners; the French arrived
time enough to prevent the explosion;
the Auftrians crofted the Rhine to Man
nheim, and the Pruflians retreated to
Worms.
STOCKHOLM, Jan, 26.
The trial of the confpirat.j s of Stock
holm is suspended : It is thought that the
arrival of Baron D'Armfeldt, who is to
be conduced as a prisoner frgm Italy in
to Sweden, is deemed neceflary to throw
greater light upon this affair; mean while ,
a secret ferment prevails; the officer 011 ]
guard near the Couiitcfs of Rudenfkold,
who has' been transferred to the prison
for Criminals, was threatened with death,
on the 14th instant in the street, by some
unknown persons masked, if fye we're not
set at liberty in the course of four day?.
In consequence, the patroles which parade
Stockholm night and day have been in
creased, and the guards doubled. A re
ward of a thcufand dollai-s has been pro,
mifed to those who fhal! give information
of the individuals in masks, who threaten
ed the officer.

NATIONAL CONVENTION,
January 26.
A deputation of Americans" was ad
mitted to the bar, and the orator demand
ed the pardon of Thomas Paine, that
apostle of Liberty, and whose arrest was
a species of triumph to all the tyrants on
earth. His papers had been examined,
and far from finding any dangerous pro
poiitions, the committee had traced only
the chara&ers of that burning zeal for
libertyâof that eloquence of nature and
philosophyâand of those principles of
public morality, v which had through life
procured him the hatred of despots and
the love of his fellow citizens. They de
manded, therefore, with confidence, that
Thomas Paine ihould be restored to the
fraternal embrace of his fellow-citizens,
and they offered themselves sureties for his
conduct during the (hort time that he
Ihould remain in France.
The President, after a high compliment
to the American people, (aid, " You de
mand from us Thomas Paineâyou are an
xious to re-condu6t to your own fide the
afTertor of the Rights of ManâWe mult
applaud this geneious devotionâThomas
Paine was born in Englandâthat was
enough to fubjeft him to the decree in the
firft instance, which our own iafety de
manded by the revolutionary laws. The
Convention will take into consideration

" the confederate powers arc willing pro

public" [btirfts of laiurhterj well, let us
provisionally destroy aH tyrannical govern
ments. [Applauded. J Do you know
what the coaielced kings are proposing to
you ? A cefTation of hoflilities for two
years. [No cefTation of hostilities ! was
the general cry.J They offer you a two
years armistice, for the purpose of efta
bli/hing among you new Vendees, in order
to recover their exhausted strength, to car
ry off your merchandize, to infett the
popular societies by their agents, to stir up
new conspiracies among you; perfidioufly
to take from you your arms, your provisi
ons, and to give you at last some royal
scoundrel for a master. This is the cefTa
tion of hostilities which is offered you ; at
â the term of its expiration, they will grant
you peace, they fay; and this peace is to
be ratified by the French people. Can it
be forgotten, that a faction, whose inten
tion it was to destroy liberty by this means,
made a similar proposal ? The French
people desire peace ; but an honourable
peace, a peace such as we shall be ready
to sign.
The tyrants offer you peacc, because
they have neither money nor foldicrs. A
| negotiator said lately in Switzerland/
" But suppose it was intended to talk of
peace, to whom in France should fen ap
plication of that kind be addressed ?"
"To whom? This is not difficult to be
determined," answered the national agent;
" we have one hundred thousand .negotia
tors at the army of the Rhine ; a hundred
thousand in the south; as many at the
northern army," (Bursts of applause,)
i Why should the French people not att as
j Rome did > Why fliould we not surround
all kings with thefamous circlcof Popilius >
If the British people wiih for peace why
do they not detach theinl'elves from their
infernal and despotic government ? Let
them cease to behave like slaves, and we
will grant them peace.âThe kings, we
are told, demand peaceâbut what have
these despots hitherto done to Obtain it i
, âHavtf they ceased to provoke the neu.
; tral governments against us, and to direct
. their perfidious mancevres against a free
. people ?. Arms and gunpowder must alone
procure us peace.
The city which struck off the head of
the Tyrant must also, furnifh the arms
and powcW which is to save Liberty. E
very day you hear the fire-arms *ried,
which near your walls are made with un
exampled activity !
But it has been necessary to surmount
great obstacles ; inflruments were to be
made, and workmen to be taught; patri
otism wanted the alliftancr of art ; atfirfl
we had no more than 2J artificers able to

it thought proper to prevent a Mival

For the Gazette of t'n United States.
Mr. Fskno,
< A correspondent in the General AJver
tlfc.i of Thursday afVs, what means public
credit ? It may be answered that it means a
ch;rafter for honor and probity, which en
able* a country to avail itfelf on any emer
gency, of the wealth of its own citizens or
of that of a foreign country. In a free coun â¢
try it conftitates a J'afd capacity for borrow
ingâwithout which liberty may be put in
jeopardy at any moment a defpntic power
may fee proper to attack itâNor is it con
ceivable how this capacity can in'a free
country be " the means of caÂ»f:ng a diftinil
ir.trrclt from that of the whole community."
The ability cf a community to discharge
its engagements depends on the general pros
perity of the qvholc people; hence it be-
Oi~*rs moil ohviouilv, the interest df the
ptK.iic Creditors to do every thing in their
power to p-omote this general prosperityâ
Neither is public credit a yoke for posterityâ
for no man in his senses would prefer loan
ing his property to a community which should
leave to another generation to discharge the
obligations of the present; it is therefore a
d-ftate of the soundest policy to provide for
the ear'ies payment of every public debt.
It may b? doubted whether " public credit
has been the source of innumerable misfor- i
timet to Europe"âOn the other hand, it is
demonPrahlc that the wars of that quarter
of the globe nave occafiov-d th- accumula
tion of their debts; the pub!.: creditors have
most cbviouily an interest direilly opposed
to war; tmlefs it can be made to appear
that the depre-oon of the funds is promotive
Of their im< reft. There is a truer cause cf
war to be afligned than ft at of ditninifhing
the capacity of a cfcnnrry to discharge its ex
i Img obligationsâWience coihe wars and
fightings, favs. aq, old fashioned bookâ
" Cpme they not hence even of your iufts >"
Until mankind, or at leall th- majority,
shall cease to bo actuated by resentment,
rage, and ambition it is utepiaa, to expeil
that wars (hill cease.
The United States are at this moment
most critically situatedâit is in the opinion
cf many, )io longer optional with us, whe
ther we ihal) be committed in the war or
not. '1 hole who are for an i:nmediate deci
sion on the part of the government to en
gage in hostilities with Great Britain-âad
vocate at the fame mom nt the annihilation
of public credit. Those who are for fup
poi ting the peace of the United States, urge
the most ettVctua l preparation for national
defence and security, and as a mean indis
pensable to this object, are solicitous to pre-
Jerve the public creditâthe present positive
state of fails, absolutely contradicts the as
sertion that public credit is the parent of
â war âfor lb: friends of peace, are branded
as the enemies of their country, for wishing
to support public creditâwhile those who
decry public credit, are clamorous for mea
sures which must inevitably cncreafe the pub
lic debtâunlcfs in the modern revolution of i
principles, war should be converted into a
blessing infUad of a curse. Would the people
Â®f tbe United States " vjijh for an encreaj*
tf the debt?" let them adopt the politics of
those who clamor for warâWould we di*-
Wiinifh the debt, let us if poff.Me ne ? ocmte
instead of sightingâshould negociation suc
ceed, the preparation for war urged by the
friends of peace, will not amount to one
hundredth part of the expence of War with
out negociationâfhould negociation fail, we
lhall then be in a situation to meet our ene
mies on some terms of equalityâ at present,
who fay that we are ? '

PHILADELPHIA,
APRIL 22.
Letter te a gentleman in this city, received
by this day's mail, dated New-York,
April jr.
" The Â£hip Ohio of this port, has arrived
at the Hook, after a passage of 43 days from
Londonâ(he is now coming up, and (hould
lhe reach the town before the mail closes,
we wil| communicate the information that
may be received by her.
u It is said that lhe failed in company
with upwards of 300 veflels, from the chan
nel, bound to d.fferent ports in America,
under convoy of some British fliips of war."
Yesterday the following resolution pas
sed the House of Representatives of The
United StatesâYeas fiftjA eightâNays
thiity eight, viz.
WHEREAS, the injuries whieh have
been fullered and may be fuffered by the
United States, from violations committed
by Great Britain cn their neutral rights
j and commercial interelts, as well as from
I her failure to execute the seventh article
j of the treaty ol peace, render it expedient
' for the interests of the United States, that
j the commercial intercourse between the
i two countries (hould not continue to be
; carried on in the extent at present allowed:
j RESOLVED, That from and after
i the firft day of November next, all com
mercial intercourse between the citizens of
the United States, and the fubjefts of the
king of Great Britain, or the citizens or
fuHjeCts of any other nation, so far as the
fame refpedts articles of the growth or ma
nufacture of Great Britain or Ireland,
lhall be prohibited.
A committee was then appointed to
prepare and bring in a bill purluant to the
above resolution.
From the Leyden Gazette of 2 "jlh Dec.
M. C. A. M. Vattel, officer in the
Swiss Guards, has written the following
letter witli a request that the Editor would
in fen it in his paper.
"In the supplement to No. 102 of
your Gazette, in the ridiculous letter of
Genet, Minister of France in America, to
Mr. JefFerfon the Secretary of State, I
find the following sentenceâ" Ido not
" remember what the worm-eaten volumes
"of GrotiUs, Pujfendorf and Vaticl fay
"on this fubjeft. I thank God, I have
" forgotten what thohireling 'writers on
" junfprudence wrote on the law of na
â¢ " tions while they were in chains." I
have a sovereign contempt for Citizen
Genet; but 1 owe it Â»to the memory ps
Mr. Vattel, my father, to hinder those
flat calumnies from deceiving honest peo
ple. My father, when he wrote on the
law of nations, was in the pay of nobody,
nor was he in chains, ifor he was a mem
ber of one of the Swiss Cantons (Neuf
chatel.) where the most happy freedom
reigns. As to his works being eaten by
"â¢oi ms, they will perhaps remain longer
than the French Republic."
)
A correspondent observes with real plea
fiire, the encreafing military disposition of
the inhabitants of this city, at this very cri
tical period, 4nd adds that it mult give fm- S
cere iatisfaiition to every friend to his country
to learn that in addition to the several volun
teer companies already established, there is a
new troop of light dragoons now organizing,
which in point of refpedlability, numbers and
equipment, will be equal to aay on the con
tinent.
_We hear that the Preiident of the United !
States has appointed Nathaniel Cabot Hig
ginfen, 1 gal cemmiffioner for the United I
States, oil a million to the Wtft-Indies to
fupermtend the entering of appeals from the
decrecs of condemnation ; to invefligate the
grounds on which they have been made and
to do other things relative to American vef- 1
fels and cargoes which have been condemned j
in the Vice Admiralty courts of the several t
Hands, and also to afford relief to our sea- â '
men now there. j
Philad. Gazette. i
Earl Stanhope on th- 33d Jan.'in the, Bri- c
j tifn House of Lords, made a motion for ac- c
knowledging the French Republic, in the b
iouowing words: i
i hat an humble Addrsfs be presented
" to his Majesty, advising his Majeltv
to diicontinue hofhlittes, as it appear- H
" ed from an article of the French
ccinftitution, that her Government
" d.d not mean to interfere in chang- u
" Government, nor fuffer anv I v
Power to alter that which fne had 11
" *Â° r . med - Paying, That his Majesty, I 1
feeing the deftrudtive nature of the "
w ' a \.' an d the delusive hope held out j
of success, would order his Mini- ei
iters immediately to acknowledge thÂ£ b
" Frsnch Republic."
Lst usdo tii!s, said his Lardfli'p ; let u'c be
jiift & honeit ( for I am not without some re
ligion ;) let us do our duty to one another;
at least, let us erfdcavour to do justice, and
leave the reft to God.
This motion was introduced with a long
speech, in which the power progress and re
sources of the French nation were exhibited
in the most animating point of viewâthe
motion was put and negatived.

been captured and carried into that port;
but neither his eloquence, or well known
legal ability could avail.

American veflels bound to or froma French

expected.
