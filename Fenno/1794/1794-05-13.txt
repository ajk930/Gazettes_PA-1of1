As to the army I have it not in my.
power to inform you of the intended move
ments ; they are near a hundred miles from
this, and it is probable to meCongreis,
ofteu receive official accounts before we
are poflefled of facts in this settlement. ,
I flatter my felf fomethiug will be done
this campaignâyou remember my story .
of the bees, by looking at the map you
may fee the line between our country and
the Indianlands; fiomthe State of Pennsyl
vania to the great Miami down the the
Ohio, the lands have been fairly purchased
from the Indian tribes, or in other words
they have received such presents as inclin
ed them to draw off from and relinquish
all their right to the aboÂ¥e described lands ;
IromPennfylvaniato thegreat Miami is our
couutry, the lands over the Miami being
in pofieflion of the Indians, we call that
the Indian country, therefore as scon as
General Wayne crossed the great Miami
he was in the Indian country and 1 am in
hopes his army likothe bees will thisfpring
begin to swarm ; the worst thing that per
haps could havehappened was the pretenti
ous of the Indians to vvifha peace; the whole
of which I believe to be nothing but dpli.-
fiou deceit and artifice, for nearly from thr.t
time they have seemed to doubletheir vigi
lance on the.efcoits and the infant settle
ment ; they are generally in Columbiatwo
or three times a week in the night, and fre
quently steal our horses and scalp our valu
able neighbors and citizens. About todays
ago they killed one of my neighbors Mr.
David Jennings, a man of excellent charc
ter as a citizen and chriftian. lam afraid
Congress will be deceived by the Indians
and consequently not forward reinforce

lome of our fellow citizens who are not
opposed to war, in point of principle,
should view the present war as being an
unjust one, fay the war is about the In
dian lands of which fay they, we are driv
ing to deprive them. I dont think that to
be the ground of the present war ; the fact
is they have received a valuable consider
ation for the above (lefcribed land, from
Pennsylvania to the great Miami; and not
withstanding, have to my khowledge been
near five years plundering and scalping the
citizens of the United States reliding on
those very lands for which they have ac
cepted a valuable consideration and this
they have done long before our government
exerted its powers tofubdue them. For my
part I not only deem the war to be a just
one ; but I believe it the duty of our go
vernment to protest its citizens, and altho'
the measures adopted have been unfortu
nate yet I cannot but feel gratefull to go
vernment for the exertions they have made, f
although 1 know they have done no more
than their duty.
For the Gazette of the United States
Some ftri&ures on sundry taxes report
ed by the committee of ways and means,

I ft. Land and labor ought never to he
taxed. They are the feed, the embrio,-
the original principles of all our supplies
and all our wealth. The farmer who hf s
purchased and cleared land, and f\Veats all
day to raise bread, has done his part t< -
wards the support of the country, and it
is no hardlhip for men who eat his bread
to pay him for it, and excuse him from
Taxes too.âThe firft tender germing and

or any other embarralsments, vexations,
â  and plagues, rieceflarily attendant on any
1 tax amount to mote than the value of
the tax it never ought to be irtpoledâl
conceive this will be readily grantedâand
1 therefore a Stamp-Duty is inadmijjible. A
1 knowledge of the various stamps neceflafy
1 in every species of writings is a trade by
itfelf, which the honelt people of the
â¢ country will never learn ; but if they could
â¢ learn this, (tamped paper will not always
be at hand, and every obligation wrote
1 on paper not properly (tamped is a nulli>
ty, &c. See. The embarra'iimcnts, Vexa
tions, nullities, injuries, loiTes, Bcc. hence
arising, will amount tÂ® four times the
proceeds of the duty, if it (hould be all
colledted and paid into the public treasury.
011 the whole* when a sum of money
is wanted, either in a nation or private
family, one way of raising it, may be
much eafierthan anotherâandlhe c-afieft,
and molt convenient method ought ever to
be adopted. A man (hould never raise
money by felling feed-wheatâthe tools of
his tradeâhis house furniture, children's
bread, so long as he has goods enough for
the purpose, which are provided merely
for file, not for use. So a (fate (hould
never impose a tax, which will embarrass
or discourage, or wound the bsfinefs and
induitry, or feelings of the subject, whillt
there are fufficient articles of luxury, or
other meichandize which are convenient
objects of taxation ; and out of which
the neceiTary monies may be drawn, with
110 loss or damage more than the fimpls
account of the sum paid ; and as such ar
ticles are matters of general consumption,
the tax thence derived will operate with
more equability and due proportion than
any other tax whatever.
This leads to an answer of a question,
which never fails to be put whert this sub
jeCt is called upâviz : You object to the
proposed tax, can you give us any substi
tute ? I answer, 1 can in plentyâwe have
many very expensive articles of useless, &
hurtful luxury, wholly untaxed, or light
ly taxed, which would afford a very pro- I
ductive fnbftitute, which would have the j
- who. of d-imiipiuary nrv^TdlelTcn their j
consumptionâviz. Silks of all forts,
Jewellery, plate and plated ware, Dia
monds and other set (tones, fine Gam- J
bricks, Laces, Feathers, and many other {
gewgaws and baubles, which might be
taxed at 20, joor 100 per cent, without I
any inconvenience, and the whole present
import may be encreafed so far as may be
necessary to make up the deficiency.
It has been objected that sundry arti
cles of the excise are as much luxuries, as
the imported ones which 1 recommend. j
I allow that whiskey, country Rum,
Snuff &c. are as real luxuries when made
at home, as when importedâ and I (hould
have no objection to taxing them, if the
collection could be made without being
coupled with, and partaking of the ca
pital mifchiefs, unavoidably incident to I
every excise. I

FRANKFORT, March i.
| At the last Assembly of the States
; of the Circle of Swabiaat Uhn, which
; took place about thd latter end of lalt
j month, to take into consideration the de
mand of the Court of Berlin, to supply tUc
Prtrffrarr aftTryrmthe Rhine with provisions,
the majority of fufFrages was wholly un
favorable to the claims of the Pruflian
Cabinet; and it was even thought useless
to consult the other Circles on this subject.
It has been resolved on the contrary, to
fend an EJiafettc to the Emperor to solicit
his protection, and to induce him that the
above mentioned demand be withdrawn.
Meanwhile the Triple Contingent is" resolv
ed on, and they are already preparing to
pick out of the mass of the inhabitants, a
Militia of 40,000 men, who will be divid
ed into regiments, well armed, and pro
vided with regimentals.
The Courts of Wurtembergand Baden,
have already carried this measure into ex
ecution .
With regard to the Circles of Franconia
and Bavaria, intelligence has been received,
that they have positively refufed the demands
of Pruflia ; and the Eledtor Palatine of Ba
varia, who seems to be the least dil'pofed-tÂ®-
approve of the plan of AVaRâ¢, made a
formal proteiVagainft the Convention ot'.the
Six Circles at Frankfort, written and issued
by the Elector of Mentz.
The resolution which may be taken by the
Circle of the Upper Rhine is not yet known.
The Pruflian Minister, Count Hardenberg,
has been sent to the Landgrave of HeiTe
Caflel, to induce that Prince by negociation,
to give his vote in the Assembly of the
States, in favor o the requiiitions of the
Cabinet of Berlin.
His Pruflian Majesty fmd : ng that his plan
of iupplymg his army has been rejetfed by
lome of the Circles, and that of the Court
of Vienna, recommending the riling in a
mass, has gained the preference, has mani
ieiled his disapprobation of a general arma
ment of the inhabitants of the' Empire.
I The French commissioners dine almost
daily with General Kalkreuth. Their ne
frociations go on but slowly, and it appears
that they have not brought with them a fuf
iirient sum of money to pay off the affignats
limed at Mentz during the siege. They have
been obliged to demand frefh remittances of
the Committee of Public Welfare at Far is.

But what madnels, what infancy woald

test ; a contest that may kil for years-x
that may overthrow all the arts and the
uleW initiations, as well as government!
of Europe, and reduce mankind to a itate
of barbanfm and despotic power! Super
u mm ? J l C Â° nflder this c Â°Â»teft to b
what it adtually was at fir ft, a ftru g fc fw
liberty on the ptrt of
France. But there is Willing more in
this controversy. A general devolution
in Europe will probably be the confe.
quence . and such 9 change is K likely to
end in general despotism, as fll the J fta .
blifhment of free governments. Look
at a.l the great civil commotions of
Greece, Rome Carthage, England
have they not all ended in tyranny ? Eook
at all the great conquests of ancient and
modern nations, and find one that has end
ed in freedom. Violent parties and fadu
ons always ead in reducing the weaker
party to the iron rod of despotism. The
military powers of a (late of war are in
conlmcnt with a free government ! it is
now an equal chance that some Cefar or
Cromwell, either by address or the plea
of nccefiity, will put himfelf at the head
of the French army, render himfelf die
tator, and make the civil power bend to
the military. And the people, tired of
war, ordiltrefs, of feftfon and the guil
lotine,- may otwd undei a dictator's ban- â¦
ners to Ihelter themselves from the fury of

A Correspondent asks whether it confifis
with the independent spirit of Americans, to
lacrifice our own interests for the benefit of
any other nation ? If the real motives with
many for taking off the Embargo was that
France might be the more ealily fupphtd

" I observe your remark refpe&ing the
returning reason of some of our folksâit
is indeed matter of rejoicing that they are
not quite deliriousâl think fobt'r reason
ing prevails more than it has for some
time part ; and hope in time it may rule
the present wrong heads. But so long
as men aim at felf exaltation above all
things, and will facriiice every thing to
climb the ladder of promotion, so long
will our country Be cursed with dich bawl
ing mock patriots.
" The Court Printers of this Town who
publilh the Chronicle, and some at the
Southward, publish papers which are
sources of corruption and nuisances in a
free country ; but so it is, and our honest
patriots iri government, must not relax
their exertions because they receive abuse
from such enemies to their country's wel

" I am sorry to observe that theft an
ties have too many representatives in a cer
tain aflembly. The retaliatory propoii
tion, the fequellration of British debts,
the non-importation, and other measures
of a similar com] ilex ion, may discover
zeal, but do not bear the features of
found sense. I trust some fcjlks deceive
themselves egregioufly by supposing their
flaming speeches will lender them popular
âthe lober sense of this people will weigh
all pretensions to their favor in the balance
-of reason and confiaerationâmay Jifhcrt
for popularity be forever disappointed.â
This period, calls for real patriotism and
found wisdomâevery consideration of du
ty and interest, require, that we Ihould a
void the war, if possible ; and I conceive
it is possible to avoid if. While the Eu
ropean nations are raving mad, we expedt
to fiiffer by their delirium; but we are
not under the necessity of fighting the
lunatics. It gives pleasure to the think
ing men in this part of our country, that
Judge Jay is nominated to goto London
to endeavor to obtain julticeâHe is an
excellent ihitefman, and will if any man
can do it, bring the mad-caps to reason.
I very much doubt the propriety of con
tinuing the embargo since the appointment
of an envoy.
" The Chronicle informs us, that we
have two good men in our delegation to

at home who burn with patriotism to take

if we take their characters from themselves,
are excellent trienâthefe are the constant

CHARLESTON, April j6
The following final decree refpe<sHng the
ship Laurens, of this port, has lately been
received.
Resolves of the provisional executive council
of France, relative to the American ihip
Laurens, prize to the French letter of
marque the Sans Culottes, of Honfleur;
23d Fremaire, 2d year of the French Re
public, one and indivisible.
ON the report Said before the provisional
â executive council, by the minilter for foreign
affairs, relative to the prize made by the pri- 1
vateer Sans Culottes, from Honfleur, of the 1
American (hip Laurens, now detained at
Havre de Grace:
Considering that the said ihip Laurens is
truly American built, that the Captain and
crew are Americans ; and whereas it is con
fident with the justice of the French Repub
lic, to bear refpeft to the neutrality of the
United States of America, and faithfully to
maintain the treaty made in 1778, according
to the second article of the national decree
in convention, dated 23d Brumaire:
Considering also, that the imperious cir
cumllances in which the republic is ii volved
in regard to provisions, give her the right to
seize, even in neutral bottoms, all the com
mejlibles which were destined for her ene
mies ports, provided the owners ars indem
nified by receiving the full value of said com
meftibles :
The members of the provisional executive
council, in virtue of the powers vefled in
them by the decree of the 28th Brumaire, 1
have taken the following resolutions: 1
Art. 1. Rice and other provisions of 1
the moil urgent necessity, which may be i
on board of said ship Laurens, or which 1
may have been landed, will be purchased 1
on account of the republic, and paid to 1
the owners, the price they would have c
been fold at, at the port of their deflina- ]
tion r {
Art. 2. By virtue of the decree afore- j
said ; the freight will be paid to the Capt. c
of said ship Laurens, fnch as it has been \
fixed in the bills of loading ; a just in- c
demnity will be allowed, besides for de- t
[ murrage, according to the time of the
detention of said (hip.
Art. 3. The (hip Laurens will be re
leased as soon as the provilions shall be
lauded.
Art. 4. AU'fentences from ?ny court
of admiralty, or other resolves passed
heretofore in rcfpeÂ£t to said (hip Laurens,,
will be entirely void and of no sol ce.
Art. 5. An indemnity (hall be grant
ed to the owner's of the letter of marque
the Sans Culottes, to make up for the cost
and charges, which -the profecutmg of
that suit may have occasioned.
Art. 6. The tninifter of the navy is
requested to fee that these resolves be
deeply executed in what concerns his de
partment, and for the execution of the
remainder referred to the mihifter for home
and foreign departments.

GENERALS.
PICHEGR U AND HOCHE.
From a London Paper of March 18.
The former was a Francifcanv and of
the fevered of his order. In the year
1789, he threw off the cowl, and served
in the National Guards. His fine form, hit
courage and his attachment to the Repub
lic, railed him by degrees to the command
of the army of the Rhine, and afterwards
to the command of the army of the North.
General Hoche is only 27 years of age.
His military talents are great, and he pos
sesses a degree of equanimity which the
mod unfortunate events do not difeoncert.
In 1789 he was a common foldfer. He
is the son of a plaifterer at Amiens. Ga
dignan, La Fayette's Adjutant, firft ob
served the manner in which Hoche diding
uilhed himfelf, and his eager defiie to
make himfelf mailer of the military art.
He learned him to draw and to take plans.
His progress was so rapid, that he soon
raised himlelf to a situation of the greatest
importance.
For the Gazette of the United States
MR. Fen NO.
"X was much pleafeT an ac
count of the Toads drank at Daily's Ho
tel on the third instantâthey are eharac
tcriftical of good Republicanism, and when
contraded with those said to have been
given at the Civic Feast, go fully to prove,
that Republicanism and how
ever analogous at fii ft fight, are found by
daily experience to be essentially different.
The twelfth toast for instance, drank at
Dally s, is, or ought to be the creed of all
11 ue RepublicansâWhereas, the majori
ty of those given at the Civic Feast, were
damped with that diabolical spirit of in
tolerance, faction and persecution, so com
mon to the Democrats of the present day.
Having thus far, in the moll unequivocal
manner approved of the toasts at Daily's,
yet I must confefs, that it is somewhat diffi
cult to divine the scope of the last volun
teer, which we are told was as follows:
" The Mountain, its summit the Heaven's,
audits lafethe whole Earth."
It is true, that many persons, when
conversing upon general topics, are very
apt to employ phrases or technical terms
attached to their particular profeflionsâ-A
fea-faring man for example, will fay, that
a cozc\\fails wellâA (hoe-maker, that his
neighbor is a good soul âA carpenter,
that every thing squares well, &c. & c .
Perhaps then, there could be no impro
pnety in supposing, that when the worthy
Speaker, was called upon for a volunteer,
he was pondering upon the practicability
of making a loaf of sugar as large as the
mountain in quellion. The idea of a py
ramid, whose cone (hould exceed the dia
meter of its base, is quite new, and may
therefore draw forth some ill-natured re
marks from the Critical Reviewersâbut,
what of that; are we always to be confin
ed within the tramels of propriety, when
â¢we wi(h to deal in the sublime > I trust
not, and more cfpecially too, at a period,
when things the leajl understood have be
come the mofl falhioflable. The Heathen
Poets, among their other crude notions
o , onom, calGeography,' were of opi
mon that the earth was stationary in the
centre of the Universe; and that the HeÂ»*
vens relted upon the (boulders of a stupen
dous mountain, .well known by the name
0 Atlas " Tile modern dogma therefore
...kâ¢ â¢ . ; i ' V.- â¢â¢â¢ -. _ .; _.
c ot a iÃOMctaiijj whole summit is compared
to the Heavens themielves, feerrs to be
nothing- more than a revival of th* old Pa
e jranfyltem, w.th this difference only, that
Ji it was true that tlie iaiu mountain waj
t cornpofed of sugar, it might prove of in
-1 finite advantage to those timid thrift ians,
who, terrified at the difficulties attending
- the narrow and rugged path, would mount
- to Heaven with alacrity on the fides of a
: Si!oar Loaf. Indeed it is not improbable,
t but that all the Democratic Societies might
f mgrfce the attempt, provided they were
ceitain of meeting with goodJpiHts at the
s eiul of their journey. v

rhe Public are cautioned to j
ieware of counterfeited Five Dollar Bills of
\bÂ» Bank of the United States, and Twenty
Dollar Bills of the Bank of North America,
i'e-veral of which have off eared in circulation
within a few days pajl; they are a good ge
neral imitation of the genuine Bills, but may
be dijlmguijbed by the following
MARKS.
Five Dollar Bills of the Bank 'of the
' United States. v
ALL that have appeared havs the letter F.
for their Alphabetical Mark.
The Texture of the Paper is thicker and
whiter and it takes the ink more freely than
the genuine paper.
Tl*e O. in the word Company is smaller
than the M. and other letters of that word,
so that a line extended from the top of the O,
to touch the top of the M. would extendcon
fiderably above the range of the whole word.
In the word United the letters are narrow
erand closer together than the reft of the bill
The i and fin the word promise are not
parallel, the /inclining much more forward
than the i.
The engraving is badly executed,the fti okes
of all the Letters are stronger and the defc c
in themargin particularly is much coarser and;
appears darker than in the Hue bills. Some
ot the counterfeits bear date in I79lâWheflt
is the Bauk was not in operation till Decern
ber, and no five dollar bills were issued in
j'lat year.
Twenty Dollar Bills of the Bank of North
America.
ALL that have appeared have the letter
B. lor their alphabetical mark.
They are printed 00 a paper nearly
to that of the counterfeit Five Dollar Notes
above defcnbed ; the engraving is better exe
ucted, and they approach nearer to the ap
pearance 'f trie genuine bills.
The fine ruled fines thiough the word Twcn
/v, in the body ot the bill, are >n number th r
tech in the genuine b lis, and but twelve in
me counterfeits.
The wo.divmpany is much like the fame
word in the Five Dollar B lis as delcr ibed a
bove, the 0 being iels than them, and others
following.
There is no ftroSe to the t in the word North
whe eas in the genuine bilis the lkroke is well
defined
The letter* tnt in the word to the
left hand at the bottom, do noi come down to
the line, but aire lb cut as to give an irregular
Appearance to the word, the Tw and go
ing Delow them.
ftie iignature I Nixon, has the appear
ance of b'ing written with lamb-black aud
0.1, and differs iroin Qther inks uled in
printing the bills and the calhiei's signature.
It is supposed these forgeries were commuted
iiHome ot trÂ«e Southern Stales, all the conn
lerfeits thai nave appeared, have cone trom

The reward of ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS
will be paid to any Person or Perform wholhall

offenders of the following descriptions or any
of them, viz.
The per(on or persons, who roanufa&ured

The printer or printers, Â©f the bills.

dpril 22, 1794,
Other counterfeit bills
ot the Bank oi the United Mates have appeal ec.
in circulation.
The denomination is of TWENTY DOL
LARS,and the alphabetical mark is the let
ter B.
They may be dillinguiilied from the genu
ine by the following MARKS ;
The paper of ihe counteiieits is of a more
tend rtexture and glofley furface than tke
genuine, aud there is no water mark in them.
Tlae letter C. in the word Cashier, in the
true bills is strongly marked, whereas in the
counterfeits, the whole letter is a fine hair
itroke, evidently in an unfinifhed state. The
letter a in the word demand, is badly formed
and the whole word ill done, and there is no
comma at the end of it, as there is in the
genuine bills.
The marginal device, is much darker in
the falfe, than in the genuine bills owing to
the (hade strokes being coarser, much nearer
together, and consequently much more nu
merous. This difference strikes the eye at firft
view.
The fame reward of ONE THOUSAND
DOLLARS, will be paid for apprehending, &
prosecuting to convittion the several above
described Offenders in iefpe<st to this, as to
the last described bills.
