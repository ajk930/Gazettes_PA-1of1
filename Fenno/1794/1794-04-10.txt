The Public are cautioned to
beware of counterfeited Five Dollar Bills of
the Bank of the United States, and Twenty
Dollar Bills of the Bank of North America,
federal of which have appeared in circulation
within a few days pajl; they are a good ge
neral imitation of the genuine Bills, but may
be diflinguijhed by the following
MARK S.
Fine Dollar Bills of the Bank of the
United States. 1
ALL that have appeared have the letter F.
for their Alphabetical Mark.
The Texture of the Paper is thicker and
whiter and it takes the ink more freely than
the genuine paper.
The O. in the wÂ«rd Company is smaller
than the M- and other letters of that word,
so that a line extended from the top of the O,
to touch the top of the M, would extend con
siderably above the range of the whole word.
In the word Un-ted the letters are na.rrow
erand closer together than the reft of tbfe bill
the i and fin the word promifc are not
parallel, they inclining much more forward
than.the i.
The engraving is badly executed,the strokes
of all the Letters are stronger and the devi e
in the margin particularly ismuch coarier and
appears darker than in the true bills. Some
ot the counterfeits bear date in 1791âWhere
as the Bank was not in operation till Decem
ber, 110 five dollar bills were issued in
that year.
Twenty Dollar Bills of the Bank of North
America.
ALL that have appeared have the letter
B. lor their alphabetical mark.
They are primed on a paper nearly similar
to that of the counterfeit Five Dollar Notes
above described ; the engraving is bcttei exe
ucted, and they approach nearer to the ap
pearance of the genuine bills.
The fine ruled lines through the word TxJben
ty 9 in the body of the bill, ara in. number thir
teen in the genuine b lis, and but twelve in
the couqterfeits.
The word Company is much like the fame
word in the Five Dollar B lis as defer ibed a
bove, the 0 being less than the m, and others
fallowing.
There is no stroke to the t in the word North
whereas in ihe genuine bills the stroke is well
defined.
The letters ent in the word to the
left hand at the bottom, do not come down to
the line,-but are To cut as to give an irregular
appearance to the word, the Tw and they go
ing below them.
The Siguature J. Nixon, has the appear
ance of being written with lamp-black and
oil, and differs from the other ink* used in
printing the bills and the cafhicr's iignature.
It is luppofed these forgeries were committed
in some ol the Southern States, as all the coun
terfeits thai, have appeared, h*ve come from
thence, and two perlons have been apprehend
ed in Virginia, on suspicion of being the authors
of them.

For the Gazette of the United States.
Mr. Fenno,
BY a wtiter in Oswald's paper of this
tnorning, signing himfelf " A friend to re
publican societies" you ire personally addres
sed, as the editor of a piece called " a hint
to Democratic Societies If I fuppofedyou
the author of that speculation, I would leave
you to defend yourfelf; but as the editor
of a free press you ought to be defended in
every exercise of rights and discharge of du
ties which such a character enjoins. One of
your rights it undoubtedly was, to give a
place 111 your Gazette to the " hint." One
of the foremofl of your duties to make pub
lic a communication tending to discounte
nance Democratic Societies. Who are these
Societies ? Does any body know them ? Do
the people of the United States, or those of
any individual state, know them ? Are they
legally elected to enquire into the conduit of
public officers, or to regulate elections ? No
Mr. Fcnno, they are neither known, acknow
ledged, or refpefted, by any class ofcitizensâ
They are felf-created, daring and impudent
usurpersâNot one of them have any legal
authority to aflemble themselves together,
and it is not going too far to fay, that it might
well be as a queltion whether they are not
fubjedts of criminal prosecution; as indivi
duals each member may have a right of giv
ing bis opinion upon public measures and
public men ; and even colleitively it may be
tolerated if decency is preserved ; but that
a trifling aflembly of people whom nobody
knows, Ihould pretend to be the organ to
express the sense of many thousands of peo
ple, at once lhows their arrogance and pub
liflies their contempt for those very rules,
they would prescribe to others. Where then
is the mighty error Mr. Printer, you are said
tc have committed when you published the
" hint" in questionâl defend not this spe
culation ?n particul i-, but every word that
can be uttered against these daring invaders
of my country's rights. This attempt to
intimidate you Mr. Fenno, is not the firft of
the kind, and you will pardon me when I
fay that it has sometimes produced its effect.
What! in this land of pretended freedom
lha.ll only one fide of a qUeftfon -belleard:
Has it already reached such a-pal's, that no
thing but mifchref is popular; and are all
the prefies of th's city h much under the
influence of popular breath, that their con
du<stors are obliged .o swim with the current
or be drowned by the tlood of antifederalifm ?
1 hope this is only a surmise of my own, but
A candid confeflion from the editors them
selves would I firmly believe confirm its
truth. Mr. Fenno, you are accused of'pub
lifhing an " outrageous, insolent, attack on
the Republic of France" I deny itâor that
any thing can be outrageous, more than the
fubjedt deservesâWhat obligation have I, or
any one else to speak or write well of France,
England, or any other country under Hea
ven, if I dislike the proceedings of their peo
pleâl am not obliged to love and adore,
what any other perlon chooses to tell me is
lovely and adorable â1 believe if people would
give themselves time to reflefl, they woulS
discover something mofe admirable in their
own country thart in any foreign one ; and
giving themselves the opportunity of con
templating the charms of their lawful wife,
they nevÂ£r would be decoyed by the falfe
blandilhments of a rival mistress.âBut Mr.
Printer, I will confine myfelf hereafter to
the writer of your reprimandâl hope you
will believe me as much at least as you do
him, in his afi*ertions, when I fay, that Soci
eties calling themselves Democratic, are high
ly improper m a representative republican
government, that they ought to be discoun
tenanced, and every honest Printer will con
tribute his mite towards it; that the stile in
which you are addrefled is menacing, inso
lent, and such as a freeman would not receive
from the mouth of any one without resent
ing it âFurther I aflert that the present De
mocratic Societies are not influenced by simi
lar motives to those which actuated the meet
ings of people, protesting against British ty
ranny & oppreflionâThe one, were in oppo
fitioir to a government, acknowledged and
approved by their country âThe others are
laying the foundation of a wall of separation
never to be broken throughâThey opposed
the arbitrary government of a foreign nation,
whose claim to rule, was founded at firft in
law and right, but which unnumbered abuses
had destroyed. The Demo. Societies are
quarrelling with their own broth, or what
ought to be such, and the government instead
of being improved by their fcnitiny, would
become contemptible if their system Ihould
prevail.
The writer is wrong in his calculation when
he fays opposition will multiply these Soci- ,
etiesâlf opposition can expose to the people,
the evil tendency and infamous designs of
such alTociations, I believe they will hardly
increase much in number or refpecftability.
In short, Mr. Fenno, to use a trite expression,
these Societies are in love with therafciv*Â»<
and without a rival.
A Friend to Republican Freedom.

Cotigrefs of the United States
Hottje of Reprefentativot
Mr. Giles's reply to Mr. W. Smith's ob
servations on the passing of the naval
armament bill.
Mr. Giles in reply to Mr. W. Smith
upon the bill providing the naval arma
ment, remarked, That having just pre
sented the outlines of his opinion upon this
fubjeft to the House. He intended not
to have troubled the House with any fur
ther observations; bat the gentleman last
up had thrown a/i imputation upon the
humanity of the oppofersof the bill, which
required an answer. The gentleman has
triumphantly asked, " Who can read the
reprelentations of the unfortunate captives
at Algiers without giving their aflent to
the bill ?"âThis question is answered by
another :âWho can read the representa
tions of the unfortnnate catives at Algiers
and can give an ajfent to the bill!â The
bill contains eflentially a declaration of
war. The means it provides are for resist
ance not for conquest. The gentleman
calls upon our humanity to ameliorate the
condition of s the captives, by a declaration
of war against a barbarian, without fur
ni(hing any means which could operate
upon his personal fears ; or perhaps the
gentleman conceives, that after the frigates
ft all have performed wonders upon the
water, they would leave the element, bold
ly march upon the land and break the
chains of the prisoners. This is aligning
a new office to the frigates, and if Mr.
Giles thought they pofleffed the ability to
execute it, he would give his heartv afTent
to the bill.
But'might it not with more reason and
probability be concluded, that a declara
tion of war under such circumstances,
would irritate the barbarians and furnifh
additional misery to the unfortunate pri
soners ? In the expedient of purchasing a
peace, which is the substitute he relied up
on, the redemption of the will
almoit constitute a pait of the
negociation. Mr. G. laid the gentleman
on this fubjeft, appeared to have forgot
ten the whole connection betwten cause
and effrS, and to have disdained all com
parison of the means to the end. He be
lieved if ever there was a measure involv
ing great political consequences, which
owed its existence to paffior., without one
effort of calculation as far at leait as it re
lated to its ostensible object, it was the
measure contemplated by the bill now be
fore the House.
Subjlance of the remarks made by Mr. Giles
on Mr. Dayton's resolution for the fe
quejlration of all debts due to Britifhfub
jefis.
Mr. Criles commenced his remarks by
observing, that he had intended to have
given a silent vote upon the question be
fore the committee, and probably should
not have altered that intention, if it had
not been from the solicitous requests ex
prefled yesterday by several gentlemen in
the oppositionâThat the favorers of the
proposed measure should furnifh the com
mittee with the reasons upon which it was
founded. Although it appeared to him
to be rather unreafoiiable, that some gen
tlemen should be expe&ed not only to
possess reasons for their own opinions, but
to furnifh reasons for others ; and altho'
he did not conceive that the favorers of
the measure were under any obligation to
difelofe the reasons inducing it, provided
they thought proper to hazard its fate up
on a silent vote ; yet he was willing to in
dulge the gentlemen with presenting to
them, the general couife of reflection,
which the fubjedt had produced in his
mind, and, which strongly suggested its
propriety. He had however a more pow
erful inducement to difclsfing his opinion
since the fubjett has become matter of dif
cuflion and its propriety doubted.
The measure is deemed a bold one, and
pregnant with serious coiifequences: In all
such cases he was desirous that his respon
sibility to the United States in general,
and to his immediate constituents in parti
cular, should at all times be attested by
the real motives which influenced his con
duÂ£t.
Several gentlemen in the opposition,
had earnestly admonished the committee
agaiwft the indulgence of their pafiions
upon this fubjedl, and recommended the
exercise of cool and deliberate reasoning.
He fliould not pretend to fay how far such
an *dmonition was necessary or juftified by
the temper of the committee : But he be
lieved it applied as strongly to the gentle
men who fuggeited the caution, as to
those to whom it was addrefledj and he
hoped in the course of the fvture discus
sion the gentlemen would shew an exam
ple in themselves of the precepts they had
prescribed to others.
As to himfelf Mr. G. declared, that
imprefled with the awfulnefs of the pre
sent crisis, he had never reflected upon a
fubjeft with more coolness, and if he un
derstood his own situation, his mind was
never in a state more susceptible of convic
tion.
The proposed measure is expected to
eventuate in a final explanation of the re
lative state of things between the United
States and Great Britain. It will pro
bably result, therefore, in open bojlilily with
the usual appeal to arms ; or, in a peace
with all the rights of Neutrality attached to
it: For this purpose the resolution propo
ses a sequestration of the debts due to the
fubjedts of Great Britain, to be held as
a pledge for the indemnification of the
lofles sustained by American citizens un
der the orders of the British king, in con
travention of the laws of nations, and in
violation of every rule of morality and
juitice. In the course of debate this fub
jeft seems to have resolved itfelf into two
questionsâFirst, as it refpe&s the right x
of one nation to fequeiter the property of
the individuals of another in any pofiible
cafe. 2d. The policy of exercising this
right at this time under the existing cir
cumstances of the United States. Â°
He presumed that a slate of things
might exist between two nations, in which
reprisal would not only become the right,
but the duty to the nation, sustaining the
wiong. This happens where ose nation
without cause, forcibly seizes upon the ef.
feds of another, or of its citizens, and
withholds them without restitution, or
compensation, and when the nation whose
effects shall be t feized and detained, (hall
possess no other means of indemnification.
The right of reprisal in tl* injured n:u
tion in luch a cafe grow?, out of the inju
ry sustained and its inability to redress it
felf in any other way. The duty of the
injured nation to make reprisals, is found
ed upon felf-prefervation; and in cafe of
the losses of us citizens, upon the pro
mise of the protection of property, fk
credly made by the nation to its individu
al members.
This he believed to be the doctrine of
the laws of morality and reason, and he
knew it to be the do&rine of the laws of
nations, which were in fa& nothing more
than the laws of morality and reason fvf
tematized and reduced to writing.

NASSAU, N. Providence, March 14.
An Experiment tried yesterday, of the
effect of red-hot shot fired from the Wa
ter Battery at a Hulk placed at the en
trance of the harbor, succeeded to the
mult sanguine wilh. The hulk of the
(hip Countels of Haddington was placed
on a (hoal within the Bar, 1850 yards
from the Battery. Six red-hot balls were
firedâof these, 5 took place. The hulk
was observed to fmoak after the second
(hot, and on the sixth striking, burst into
flames.
The fight was highly gratifying to the
inhabitants, both au it demonftratcd the
esÂ« with which any attack of shipping
might be repelled, as it afforded a pleasing
proof of the proficiency of their fellow
citizens in the art of gunnery.
The whole was done by Captain North's
militia company of Engineers, without
the smallest participation of any of the
military.
Our advices from Charleston, which
are of last Saturday, render a rupture with
America not a very improbable, nor in
appearance a very distant event., We do
not wi(h to give unnecessary alarm to our
fellow colonists, but to put them on their
guard in every refpeftâand beg leave ear
nestly to recommend to the planters, to
plant a greater proportion of their land in
provisions, than they have done hitherto
âthe propriety of this measure is fuffici
ently obvious.
As the French naval force in America
is now considerably increased, the inter
ruptions to our commerce with the states,
will probably be more frequent than here
tofore.
The French party in America do not
seem aware of the fouices of fuppiy
which may be had resort to by the Britilh
colonies, in the event of communication
with the American States beingftopt or im
peded by the talked of reftridtions. The
Floridas and Louisiana can afford abund
ance of lumber and corn, and our neigh
bors of Cuba can spare us both corn and
cattle.
Of flour, we can have ample supplies
frjm Europeâlt was from thence that
our i(lands during the American war were
chiefly fupplicd ; and every one knows
that during the peace, the French colo
nies were exclusively so.
It is not our business to point out the
impolicy of America entering into war
with the firft maritime power in the world,
especially now when that power is connec
ted by the strongest bonds of alliance
with all the great commercial nations of
i.urope. But we cannot help regretting
that any foreign influence should gain such
ascendancy in the councils of America as
to urge her to a measure, which must e
vcntually involve her people not only in
â war abroad, but in anarchy and diflention
at home.

In the House of Rep-efentatives on Tuef

the fliips or cruisers of any foreign nation.
And that the persons who may be so appoint
ed be further authorized and directed to as

American veflels that have been or may be
captured and carried to said ifiands for trial,
in the legal defence of their veflels and pro

NEW:YORK, April 9.
from the St.Eustatius Gazette of
March 14, 1794.
KING' S SPEECH.
The following is his Britannic Majefly's
Speech, delivered at'the House of Parliament
on the 21ft day of January, 1794.
My Lords and Gentlemen,
THE circumstances under which you are
afiemblcd require your most seriouS attention.
We are engaged in a contest, on the iifue
of which depends the maintenance of our
constitution, laws, and religion, and the secu
rity of all civil society.
You mnft have observed, with fatisfaition,
the advantages which have been obtained by
the arms of the Allied Powers, and the change
which has taken place in the general lituatiun
of Europe, since the commencement of the
war. The United Provinces have been pro
tected from invaiion. The Austrian Nether
lands have been recovered and maintained ;
and places of conliderabie importance have
been acquired on the frontiers of France.
The recapture of Mentz, and the subsequent
fuccefies of the allied armies on the khine,
have notwkhftanding the advantages recent
ly obtained by the enemy in that quarter,
proved highly beneficial to the common cause.
Powerful efforts have been made by my al
lies in the Sotlth of Europe. The tem
porary polTeilion of the town and port of
Toulon has greatly distressed the opera
tions of my enemies; and in the circum
stances attending the evacuation of that
place an important and decisive blow has
been given to their naval power, by the
distinguished conduit, abilities, and spirit
of my commanders, officers and forces,
both by sea and land.
The French have been driven from
their poflefiions and fifhery at Newfound
land ; and important and valuable acqui
sitions have been made both in the East
and Weft Indies.
At lea our fuperioty has been undispu
ted, and our commerce so effectually pro
tected, that the losses sustained have been
inconsiderable in proportion to its extent,
and to the captures made on the contract
ed trade of the enemy.
The circuinftances by which the further
progress of the Allies has hitherto been
impeded, not only prove the neceflity of
vigor and perseverance on onr part, but
at the fame time confirm the expectation
of ultimate success. Our enemies have
derived the means of temporary exertion,
fiomafyitem which enabled them to dis
pose arbitrarily of the lives and property
of a numerous people, and which openly
violates every restraint of justice, humani
ty and religion. But these efforts, pro
ductive dj they have necefTarily been of in
ternal dilcontent and confufion in France,
have also tended rapidly to exhauit the na
tural and real itiength of that country.
Although 1 cannot regret the ne
ceflary continuance of the war, I should
ill coniuit the e.Tential interests of my peo
ple if I were desirous of peace, on any
grounds but such at may provide for their
permanent fafety, and the independence
and security of Europe. The attainment
of these ends is still obttrutted by the
prevalence of a system in France, equally
incompatible with the happiness of that
countiy, and with the tranquility of all
other nations.
Under this imprefiion I thought pro
per to make a declaration of the views
and principles by which lam guided. I
have ordered a copy of this declaration
to be laic before you, together, with co
pies of federal conventions and treaties
with difieient powers, by which you will
perceive how laige a part of Europe is
united in a caui'e of such general con
cern.
I reflect, with unspeakable fatisfa&ion,
on the steady loyalty and litm attachment
to the established constitution and govern
ment, which, notwithstanding the conti
nued efforts employed to millead .and se
duce, have been so generally prevalent a
mong all lanks of people. These senti
ments have been'eminently manifefted in
the zeal and alacrity of the militia to pro
vide for our internal defence, and in the
diitinguifhed bravery and spirit displayed
on every occalion by my forces, both by
sea and land : They have maintained the
lustre of the Britilh name, and have fhewji
themselves worthy of the blefiings which
it is the objedl of all our exertions to pre
serve.
Gentlemen of the Houfr. of Commons'
I have ordered the neceflary estimates
and accouuts to be laid before you : and I
am persuaded you will be ready to make
such provision as the exigencies of the
times may require. I feel too sensibly the
repeated proofs, which I have received of
the a Sedition of my fubje&s, not to lament
the neceflity of any additional burthens.
It is, however, a great consolation to me,
to observe the favorable state of the reve
nue, and compleat success of the measure,
which was last year adopted for removing
the embarrassments a fleeting commercial
credit.
Great mud be the extent of our exer
tions, I trust you will be enabled to pro
vide for them in such a manner as to avoid
any pressure which could be feveiely felt
by my people.
My Lords and Gentlemen,
In all your deliberations you will un
doubtedly bear in mind the true grounds
and origin of the war.
An attack was made on us and our al
lies, founded on principles which tend to
deilroy all property, to subvert the laws
and religion of every civilized nation, and
to introduce universally that wild and de-
Itru&ive system of rapine, anarchy, and
impiety, the effe&s of which, as they have
already been manifefted in France, furnifh
a dreadful but ufefuLkifon to the present
age, and to posterity.
It only remains for us to continue to
persevere in our united exertions: Their
discontinuance or relaxation could hardly
procure even a short interval of delusive
repose, and could never terminate in secu
rity of peace. Imprefled with the necefli
ty of defending all that is molt dear to us,
and relying, as we may with confidence,
on the valour and resources of the nation,
on the combined efforts of so large a part
of Europe, and, above all, on the incon
teltible justice of our caufc, let us render
our condudl a contrail to that of our ene
mies, and, by cultivating and praftifing
the principles of humanity and the duties
of religion, endeavor to merit the continu
ance of the divine favor and protection,
which have been so eminently experienced
by these kingdoms.
The Captain of the brig arrived yester
day in 18 days from Martinique, informs
us, that the British forces had NOT got
pofTeflion of Fort Bourborn, in Martinque,
on the 20th March, they were erecting
new batteries against it every day. A
great mortality prevailed in the British
fleet, and among their troops on land ; â
sick and wounded were earned in great
numbers â every day to the hospitals. Up
wards of 50 fail of Americans lay in St.
Pierre's. Two captains whose vessels were
taken from them in Martinique, came
pafTengers in the above brig ; one belong
ing to Philadelphia, the other to Provi
dence, R. I. All the American lailor's
are confined in a PRISON SHIP, except
60, who were PRESSED on board the
fleet.
Capt. Rock informs us that the French
fleet hyid not failed from the Chefapeak 4
days ago.
"It is reported, that the AÂ©bufcade frigate
lately fell in with the HuilarT British frigate,
and a Bermudian privateer, which lhe en
gaged both together, and after an obllinate
battle, took, and sent them into that port,*
whert th ey fafely arrived last Thursday.
* No port is mentioned in tbe N. York
paper.
BOSTON, April 2.
Mr. Morris, the American Ambassador
to the Republic of France, whom reports
have ccnfidvifd as Unpopular at Paris, La
lately received ample proofs of confidence
and attention si orn the government of that
country. â¢
Yeiterday General Belgarde landed in
this town, and waited oh,the French Con

and has fevers! persons in his suite.
The following letter from Admiral Jervie,
to a gentleman iu this town, was re-

AN ESSAY ON THE
Natural Equality of Men,
Jn the Rights that result from it, and on the
Duties which it imposes.
To which a MEDAL was adjudged, by the
Teylerian Society at Haarlem.

By WILLIAM LAWRENCE BROWN,

of Nature, and of Ecclesiastical History ;
and Minister of the Englilh Chuich at U

Aliquid feinper ad communem utilitatem af
ferentfum. Cicero.
The Firjl American Edition.
THE graud principle of Equality, if right
ly understood, is the only basis 011 which
universal justice, sacred order, and perfect
freedom, can be firmly built, and permanentr
ly secured. The view of it exhibited in this
essay, at the fame time that it repreffcs the
insolence of office, the tyranny of pride, and
the outrages of oppression j confirms, in the
mod forcible manner, the neceflitV of subor
dination, and the just demands ot lawful
thority. So far indeed, from loolening the
bands of society, that it maintains inviolate,
every natural and every civil diftinftion,
draws more closely every locial tie, unites in
one harmonious and jultly proportioned sys
tem, and brings men together on the even
ground of the inherent rights of human na
ture, of reciprocal oblication, and of a com-
u -P.
