For printing by Subfcriptio"*
A Work, to be entitled,
THE FIRST VOLUME OF
Pennjylvania State Trials.
THE want of fuflicient information of the
state trials of Great-Britain in the early
periods of that government is now lamented :
Hitherto there hath been but one trial in the
state of Pennsylvania on impeachment and
here also tt is to be regretted, that, being neg
lected at the time, the public are now left with
out lufticient information on the fubjeÂ£t of that
trial, it is however in this -woik designed to rcf
cue what can be collected thereof from sources
of indifputaple authority, so that the fame shall
be preserved from oblivion.
Another impeachment and the second is now
depending. An officer is charged by the late
House of Representatives, who hath for many
years been largely confided in by this state, and
hath long been at the head of the financial de
partment of the fame, and it imports the citi
zens to know hiscondu6t, and thecircumftances
which may be'brought forward on his trial.
In this work the Editor will be careful to
state the facts, as they may be brought forward,
and to lay all the evidence and papers before
the public.âWith this viewâ
The following Terms are refpeÃfully
submitted to the Public :
I. The Work shall be printed in oaavo, with a
I good type, on fine paper, and delivered to
fubferibers at the refpe&ive places where the
fubferiptions are taken in, as soon as the work
shall be compleated
11. As no eonjcfturc can well be made, as to
the length ot the present trial, the fi/.e the
volume cannot be ascertained at this timeâ
But the price (hall not exceed that of fomeof
the latest publications io this city.
111. It will contain all the preliminaries and in
cidental circumstances that may occur during
the trial of John Nicholfon, Esquire, Comp
troller-General of this Commonwealth, with
the arguments of counsel oa both fides, together
with the articles of impeachment, and the
pleas and replications at large, the several re
solutions of the two branches of the ftitc Le
gislature, refpefting this impeachment, and
the final decision of the SENATE refpe&ing
that officer.
To which will be prefixed, as much as can be
colletted from authentic documents, of the im
peachment, trial, and aequital of the late Francis
Hopkinfon, Esquire, Judge of the Court of
Admiralty for the state of Pcnnfylvania, during
the late war, never before pnblilhed.
No money will be required before the deli
very of the book.
Subscriptions will be received by Francis

With respect to the proposed commer
cial regulations, there can be little doubt
that they would have injurious effe&s, in
which ever way they can be viewed
with refpea to an increase of duties
there can be little doubt if a considerable
addition 13 made, that it would not increase
the revenue, as it would try the virtue of
many and have the cflch to introduce
imugglmg ; besides driving many pejfons
from carrying on a trade which must "be
attended with loss ; far, fiom the present
burdens occalioned by the vcrv great ad
ditional expence of freight and insurance,
manyperfuns are holding their hands as to
importations from an apprehension of
grest lofTes in remittancesâlt is certain
ly a more proper mode in the nrft inftnnce
to represent the inquiries we have received
and to require redress, than to engage in
ralh measures, which we ate not able to
support ; and if we cannot obtain jufticc
It would be better to decline commerce
altogether, for a time, than to pursue a
conduct which would bring us into expen
ses, which must operate to injure us for a
long time to come.

According to these reports, the French
who on the 23d ult. occupied the strong
pout ion at Hagaeiiau, from which they
had driven General Wurmfer, gave orders
to their General for improving this ad
vantage. They brought him to a gene
en on the 24th, in which he
was totally routed, his artillery, (lores,and
camp equipage taken.
On the 25th they attacked the Duke
of Brunfwick in his cntrenehments, for
ced them with the (laughter of 12,000 of
his men, and drove the remnant of his ar
my into a situation in which it was suppo
sed they mull either be cut to pieces or
lay down their arms.
The Neapolitan Prince taken by the
French at Toulon, is son to the King of
Naples, and nephew to the late Queen of
France.
Accounts by the way of Brufleli speak

A icuch call the EnghHi redoubt, was oc
cupied by 2,500 Britilh and joo Spanilh
troops, die two flanking redoubts by 200

The French armies of the Mczelle and
the Kiiine, having formed a jun&ion, have
a; la't fncceeded in driving Gen. Wurm
icr from his itroug poiitioaat Magtieneau
with confidence !ofs; and as their prin

That a National Fete (hall be celebra

Preparations for a new campaign were

AN ESSAY ON THE

On the Rights that result from it, and on the
Duties which it impoks.
To which a MEDAL was adjudged, by the
Teylerian Society at Haarlem.
C arretted and Enlarged.

ot Nature, and of Eccleliattical History ;
and Minister of the English Chut en at U
trecht.
Aliquid semper ad communtm utilitatein af
ferendnm. Cicsro.
The Firjl American Edition.
THE grand principle of Equality, if right
ly under It ood, is the oniy basis on which
universal justice, sacred order, and perfect
freedom, can be firmly built, and permanent
1 y secured. The vewof it exhibited in this
eflay, at the fame time that it reprefTes the
insolence of office, the tyranny of pride, and
the outrages of oppreflion ; confirm*, in the
most forcible manner, the necessity of subor
dination, and the joft demands of lawful au
thority. So far indeed, from loosening the
bands of society, that it maintains inviolate,
every natural and every civil diftin&iyn,
draws more clo r ely every foeial tie, unites in
one harmonious and juflly proportioned sys
tem, and brings men together on the even
ground of the inherent rights of human na
ture, of reciprocal obligation, and of a com
mon relation to the community.
