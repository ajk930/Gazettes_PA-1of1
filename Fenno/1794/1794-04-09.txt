A BRIEF REVIEW
Of the lajl PROCEEDINGS if the
POLISH DIET.
The close of the Diet was worthy of
an afiembly, from which epoch Poland
may date her political annihilation, the
remembrance of which will remain deep
ly engraven on the hearts of the friends
of humanity and juftiee. The last fit
tings were remarkable for the turbulent
and precipitate manner in which they
hastened to finifh or murdi*r the greatest
concerns which wen. yet upon the Carpet.
Among these may be ranked the new
constitution. However efiential such an
object was for the trunk of the republic
which yet preserves the name of Poland
and Lithuania, no detailed discussion was
had upon the different articles which com
pose it. The project which had been
previously formed, was adopted with lit
tle variation. It was accepted in the
whole; and its acceptation was inferibed
on the registers, adding, Â« that it had been
read in the prtfence of the States, in confe
derated Diet assembled." j
About twenty Nuncios wanted to en- f
ter a arotell, it is true, agamft lome ot <
the articles ; but Â»<> attention was pud
either to their opinion or opposition ; and
this new form palled into a law, at lealt
for the prefeut ; but it cannot be said
how long it may lad, for it is not guar
ariteed, even b) Russia, It is remarked,
that the 15th article of the treaty of alli
ance between Russia and Poland exp.c'.y
provides, that no change (hall be made by
the king and the Republic, in the form
of government to be tltablilhed, but in
coticert with tlie JL'mpref* of Russia or
her fucceflors.
Thus, though (he h S s not guaranteed
the perpetuity of the new conftifution, it
is provided, that if it (hall ueqwhv any
alteration, such (hall uor f>e made with
out her consent. It h-J beÂ«n published
in the Polifli tongue, and contains lour
parts, the, firft, the fundamental laws ; the
others proscribe rules for the Dietines, tue |j
different tribunals, the clergy, &c. A
nother ast parted at the end of the fitting-,
confirms the difmen"t$ ,f -rment of the Re
public } in eftablifliir.g three commissions
for fixing the limit 3 ; one for the confines
between Ruflia and Little Poland : ano
ther for those between Ruilia and the Po
lish Lithuania ; the third for regulating
frontiers with Polandâ>t.ie
whole according to the treaty of Ccffioii
signed in the ratne of the Diet.
The treaty of commerce with Berlin
met with many difficulties, particularly
with regard to the duties on ilaple com
modities which the city of Dantzic en
joyed, when undei the sovereignty cf
Poland. However, the rfofe of tht Diet
was not deferred on that account, and
the further consideration was referred to
the new permanent council, and the conv
miffioncrs of the treasury. It lias finer
been concluded, one article excepter,
which is probably that of the commerciil
rights of Dantzic, which M. Buckhcltz
would not determine of himfelf, but di.-
patched a courier to Berlin for inftrufti
ons, which may authorize him to sign the
treaty. âCount de Sievers supported, du
ring the treaty, as much as poflibje tlie
ccmmeicial privileges of Poland 5 but in
a manner which in no way interrupted the
good understanding that subsisted between
him and the Prussian minister who tho't It
his duty, at the moment fhc l>rct was Â»-
botit to break up, tÂ« teftify how amicable
the concert between him and the Ruffian
minister had been.âHe therefore felicitat
ed the Diet, by a note on the alliance it
had concluded with the court of Pet erf
burgh ; and.he afiured ft, that the treaty
was so much the more agTeeable to the
king his matter, as the empress was his
friend and ally.
Poland, reduced to one third of its
former extint and strengtH, has loft a
proportional part of its reveuues. she
regulation of the finances has therefore
become more difficult. In the last fitting,
two loans were projected under the gua
rantee of her Ruffian majelty ; one of'
27,000,000 of Polifli florins, for the pay
ment of the particular debts of the King,
the other of 10000000 for the necessities
of the Republic.âThe revenues of the
King's domains are particularly destined
to extinguish his debts.
The finances of the republic for the
future, by this dismemberment, will ufct
exceed 16,000,000 are produced by the
Polifli provinces, and 6,000,000 by the
remains of Lithuania. As these must
support the army and the other expences
of the civil lift, arid the revenues of the
King, they have been reduced a tjlird ;
and his Majesty will only hereafter draw
3,000,000 from the treafyry. The two
last fittings of the diet were exceedingly
turbulent. The discontent with the pro
ceedings of the Ruffian Ambaflador broke
out with great violence; aid the efferye
fcence of the oppofing'-Jjarty had nopther
confequncethan what a momentary agita
tion usually produces. A millitary order
had been abolished on the representation of
the Empress. The re-establishment of
the order was demanded and decreed. No
sooner had the decree paSed, than an offi.
cer appeared in the middle of the hall
with these diftfn&ive marks : he thanked
the King for having restored to the brave
Polilh army a decoration which it had so
well merited, in bravely defending its coun
try. The Nuncios all rose, and advanced
in a tumultuous manner towards the
throne, to kiss his Majesty's hands, and'
exprefled their gratitude to him. The de
cree, which could not fail to displease the
Ruffian Minister, pafled unexpectedly and
111 1 hur T- Tfce wife and virtuous Sta,
niflaus endeavored to rcprefs the diiordsr
cf these delibfrations, and to decline \he
ihajiks offered him. His eloquence ever '
temperate and magnanimous.
: Such was the end of that famous Diet
of Grodno, which terminated on the 24th
Xlov. As it was 1 efolved to dissolve it, the
bft fittings were so huryied, that hiany ar
ticles, which were to receive its tinal laoc
tian, were Dot read. The number to be
pal Ted on the 23d arid 24th were 112,
which were divided into three claffcs ; of
which the Secretary read only the title:
the firft class contained 40 projects relative
to the New Conflitution : the lecond, 32
DHpofitions of the bit Pitt held at Wsr
: saw, which werÂ« not revoked nor abroga
ted, as were the other laws made by that
1 Assembly; but whieu appeared to require
the confirmation of the present Diet:
the third class cdntained forms of decrees
on affairs. After the reading of the ti
tles, the fiiit 40 form? of dtcrees received,
the fanttion of the Stale, and were mane
formal law 6.
The fvla'rftial of the Diet received for
his trouble and good otf.ees during the fit
tings, a recompence of 100,000 Polish
fibrins; the Secretary, 20,000; and tire
Chancellor, 15,000. Counts Branicky
and Rzewufki, who were, with the Count
Staniflans Potocki, the firit to propose
the confederation of, Tergovica, resigned
their place of Grand and Little General
of the Crown : the fii-ft succeeded by the
chamberlain Ozarofki, the second by ge
neral Pulawfki, whe discharged latterly
the office of Marfoal of the General Con
federation,
Thus closed the fun&ions of an As
sembly, which', from the unfortunate eir
cumftances of the times, was forced to
seal the dismemberment of a once power
ful kingdom. The historian of the pas
sing period will be at a loss to make iiis
election in the variety of important eve.its
that will press upon his notice, and claim
his serious regard ; he will at once have ,
to record the most flagitious crimes that
ever disgraced humanity, and the hwheft
excellence that ever adorned it. From
the attrocities of French Legislators, he
will turn with rapture, with renovated en
thusiasm, to dwell upon the mild, and at
the fame manly virtuci of a ot
Poland. - , ,
For the GmzsiTf. fyfxrh.
Well said, Mr. Honcilus, stick at no
thing i (he-w us, you know how, to m.f
reprefent as well as to calumniate ; where
pray did you finrl from Mr. Z. that the
Orator afiurr.ed to htmfclf the merit of the
finaricierâall he laid claim to was, men iy
the merit of lending an helping hand, and
this no body can with truth deny him;
documents, of the most unaniwerabk kind,
are icady to prove if necelTary, from the
financier himfelf, and other officers of the
tritafury department of that time, that in
the public station filled by the Orator, he
acquitted himfelf with zeal and fidelity to

consideration binds him, for the latter, he
feels the most poignant regret at feeing it
so wretchedly governed ; governed in a

March 28.
Mr. Swift's obfenvations upon Mr. Dayton's.
propiftion, to fequefler Britijb
Mr. Swift remarked, that 011 the firft view
of the fubjedi, he had been inclined to favor
the pjropofition, not having attended, minute
ly to. the difliji&ion wade.by the la,wa of na
tions, refpeaing the peoperty of an enemy
liable to reprisalâbut on a full inveftigafion,
of the fubjeit, and mature deliberation, he
was convinced that the proposition under
consideration would be a direct and mani
feft violation of the laws of nationsâhe was
therefore, clearly and decidedly opposed to
it's adoptionâGentlemen have said mucli
refpe&ing the infuhs and the injuries which
we have received from the British nationâ
but Mr. S. conceived it to be unneceflarv
that gentlemen should ddcribe their infuhs
and injuries in the, highest colours to inflame
our paflions, and to animate our refexument '
âHe believed that every gentleman in the
committee deeply felt the indignity which
hand been offered to their country, and was
convinced that Creat Britain had been guilty
of a violation of the laws of nations but
Under such cireumftances, it was our duty to
condudV with coolncfs, candor, and modera
tion âHe thought that the heat and passion
which had been manifefted in the course of
the debate, were inconsistent with that digni
ty and propriety which ought to mark the
deliberations of the Legislature.
Mr. S. observed, that the conduit of the
British Court in regard to their concealing
in fÃch a lingular manner, the order of the
6th of November, and the equivocal terms
in which it was exprefled, was greatly to
their dishonor. But he thought that the words
legal adjudication, would fairly admit of a
conftru<sHon that no American vefiel that '
Ihould be taken pursuant to that order, could
be liable to be condemned, unleft warranted
t>y the, laws of nationsâThere was reason
to apprehend that such was the intention of
the British Cabinetâand that the Coutts of
Admiralty in the Weft-Indies, in their con
demnations, had exceeded their jurifdi&ion,
and contraditfted the design of the Court of
London, recent intelligence confirmed the
ideaâNo information of these illegal tranf
a<Sions had yet been communicated to them
âIt was poiiible that when that Court were
trade wjfri tinr iraff
sustained, tTTat they would award restitution
or compenfetion.â-Mr. S. remarked, that
"by the Tirws V no nation haJ "a right" %
to make reprisal for any injury till all other
means of obtaining justice had failedâthat
it was our duty in the firft place, to repre
sent to the Court of Great Britain, the spoli
ations that had been made on our commerce
by the illegal condemnation of our vefltlsâ
that till we bad-done this, the laws of nations
would not warrant us to make reprisals on
the goods and cffeifU of the British nationâ
That there was a possibility of obtaining a
fatisfaAory explanation of their conduit and
reparation for the injuries we had fulleredâ
It was therefore a proper tubjeit of negotia
tionâBut he fa'id if thai nation will not do
lisjuftice, then-we are authorized to make
reprisals.
Mr, S. then observed, that when we had Â»
taken such steps as would authorize reprifa!â,
we Ihould be precluded by the laws of nation?
from adopting the proposition under confe
deration. He said that a gentleman from
Maryland, (Mr. Mercer) had yesterday as
serted, that Burlamaqui was the only autho
rity among the writers on the laws of nations
against the measure ; and that the opinion of
Vactel was in favor of it. Another gentleman
from Maryland, (Mr. Smith) had read a
paflage from Vattel, which he considered as
an authority in point, to juftify the seizing
of private debtsâbut not debts due from
the publicâBut if these gentlemen had tho
roughly examined Vattel, they would have
found iriftead of his being an authority in
then favor, he had in the most direit terms
maintained a contrary opinionâHe then read
a paflage from Vattel, that shewed that
the effects of an enemy in a country at the
time of a declaration of war cannot be Siz
ed, but that the owner is entitled to a reason
able time to remove themâand another pas
sage which expressly declared, that by the
usage and custom of modern nations, public
and private debts are not the fubjeit of repri
sal. Mr. S. conceived that these rules were
founded in file highest wifdom âthat all del ts
were contra&ed under a fenftion of public
faith, and an understanding that a war fhc 18
not render them liable to seizure or confisca
tionâthat a moral obligation existed between
the comrafting parties for the payment of
the debtsâand that no government could
ever have a right to violate a moral obliga
tionâThat therefore by the law of nations
in all inft .nces where property comes into
the poffefiion of a nation by a confidence
reposed in their honor and faith âas in cafe
of public or private debts, such property can
never be the fubjeft of reprifaj, because this
would be to authorize a breach'of public
faithâbut repr sals are always to be made on
I property in polTeiTion of the nation who has
| done the injury and which maybe taken with
| out any violation of thofc principles whichought to fce helifacred in time oÂ£ war.
Mr. S. remarked that it had been fuggeit
t\ that the Britilh nation had been guilty
of a violation oi the laws of uations in their
treatment of usâand that therefore we were
cot bound to govern ourfelvesby that law in
Â®ur coilduil towards them-âThis argument
however plausible he fald would not bear the
tell of examination âthat all reprisals were
juftified only on the principle that the natioii
on whom reprisal is made has been guilty of :
a previous violation of the laws of nations â
When .* nation disregards that general law
fc,- which the conduit ofall independent com
munities towards each other Is to be regulat
ed the tine law points out the mode 6f re
drefsâlf" therÂ« has been no violatfon of that
law, there, can be no reprisal. .If there has
been a violation, then the feprifal rtvuft be
purl'uanttoQrfWV. &<"-& is the highetl. ib
furdity to lay, that because there has been an
infraction of a law which authorizes,! certain
mode of redreft, that we may pursue a dif
ferent mode 6f redress in violation of the law
which gives us the right: This would be at
once to renounce the whole fyltem of the lawS
gf nations, and threw mankind bark into a
state of savage barbarity and ferocity.
Mr. S. then adverted to the policy of the
meal'uie, He laid upon a fair oalculation, it
would be found that the adoption of the pro
pufition, would be productive of far greater
mjury to this country, than the aniounc of
the loifes fultained by our citizens, in confe
cu nce of the fpciliations committed upon
our commerce. It is evident that this coun
try> even admitting that a war lhould take
pia :e, would with to review their commerci
al connexion with Great Britain. But if in !
contempt of the law of nations, we seize on j
private debts, we iHall forevtr forfeit all cre
dit; no (rufi can be reposed in our citizens,
and no faith in our government. No foreign
Merchants willever deal on credit with wr
dtizeus, from a well-guirtted apprehension
that in caie of a 'war between the countries,
the'litred nature of private contradts will
not protect them against the hahd of a Go
vmiment flfl.ieh !:as exhibited the example of
a deliberate violation of the laws of nations.
When we consider the immenl'e advan;ages
that can be derived from private credit and
national honor, it will be easy to imagine
the uifcnke miichief that mull result from a
diiVegard of thofc principles.
Mr. .Swift obiefted to the meafilre on
the ground thai he considered it to be a
declaration of warâand he did not think
that the cireumftances required or juftified
our taking that ltep. He said that uot
withftanding the unwarrantable prcceed
; intra of the Britilh nationâyet, no ast
"liad been done, by tin. Court that
clearly indicated an intention to make wai
directly upon ns, or thtt could be coufr
cered as direct and intentional vrarj tho'
we might consider many of their a&s as
jaft causes of making war on our part.
The revocation of the order of the 6th
of November, the new inftruftion& of the
Bfh of, January, aiid the explanation giv
en tÂ« the merchants of London, clcarly
evidenced that a war might be avoided
with that nation. While there was the
Temoteft poffibilityof preserving our peace,
we ought not. to do art ast tvhich might
endanger a war. While ther. the conduct
of the Britilh cabinet Would admit of an
pxpjanation, while there was a profpeft
that we might obtain by negoeiation, res
titution of the property of our citizens
or compensation for the lofles they had
fultained, we ought to pursue that mode
âbut if we proceeded to make reprisals
by adapting an illegal rr. -dure, it mull
certainly be deemed a declaration of war.
The omiflion of the regular means of
obtaining latisfnftion by negotiation and
an itriwar antable mode of reprisal would cer
cei tainiv be jult causes of war. If ,ve mult
be driven into a war it would be of the
liightft advantage to us, to conduct in
inch ama mi i-1 as to convince the people
of Gieat Britain, that we sincerely wi(h
ed to avoid it, and that the unjust and ille
gal proceedings of their own Court have
been the sole cause of the war. In such
caff ire have reason to think, that so great
is the interest of that nation in preserving
our commercial connection, that a power
ful party will be formed in our favor to
oppole the injuitice of the I
The sentiments of the people-Will be a
â¢rainft the war, and the Court will find it
extremely difficult to maintain it under
iucli cireumftances.
Bnt, if without demanding an explana
tion, we proceed to adopt raft, violent,
and unwarrantable measuresâthe fpirft
of the nation will rife against us, and the
people will join the Court in prosecuting
a war which will be then deemed just and
neceflary.
Mr. Swift then observed that we ought
tnJake into canfideration the'prefent Ctu
rfrjon of Europeâ that the late fuccefTes
-<>' the F '"*ach nation bad materially chan
ged the political profpeft. I t was poffi
.ble tha; these fucceflei had been the cause
v -hat! produced an alteration in the
views of the Briti/h Court. If events had
happened which had rendered the difpoli- i
tion of that natioh less unfriendly and hof- i
tile, we ought to take advantage of that
circumstance, and not do any thing to
check the progress of that favorable dif
polition. He most sincerely hoped that
their successes would convince the combi
ned powers of the impossibility to con
quer France,and produce a general pacifi
cation.
While such were the profpeft j he ar
dently wilhed that a measure repugnant to
the principles of common honesty and
â  common justice might berejefteaâand he
hoped that no gentleman in the commit
tee would vote in favor of a proposition
which would fix an indelible stigma on
Q ur national character.
PHILADELPHIA,
APRIL 9.
There are letters in town from Antigua
of the 15th March, and from St. Etiftatia of
the 30th, to a refpeclable merchant of this
cityâwhich fay that the condemnation of
American property has ceased in the Illands,
since the receipt of the late inftruclions fioin
the Britilh government.
By a gentleman just arrived from Lexing
ton, Kentucky, we are informed that Gen.
Wayne moved from his winter cantonmept,
â with the legion of the] United Stales, 011 the
ftrftof March, for the Miami Villages.
The fame gentleman alio informs,that-pre
vious to the march of the Legion, a duel
was fought by Lieut. Huflon of the 3d, and
Lieut. Bradlhaw, of the lit Sub Legion,
which terminated in the death of both, the
former having expired on the spot, and the
latter 10 houis after.

" Mr. B. informs of the arrival of a
schooner it New-York on Saturday, from
St. Lucia in 17 daysâthe Captain re
lates that a fleet of 8 fail of the line had
arfived at Martinique from France, and
had landed s,cxjo men, wbo had cut off
the communication between the British
army and fle/t.
" The Captain faiv the fleet failing
' for Port-Royal Bay, in wliicli the IJotigh
ty Sir John Jarvis, was at anchorâvfe
may reasonably expect therefore that the
fiegc of Martinique may be converted in
to an attack on Jamaica.
" The Sans Culottes it is said, were
furnifhed with only three pounds, and
were ordered to rely on the bayonet."
Extract of a letter from a gentlemart hi St.
Martins, dated March 15, 1794.
" By the last accounts from Martinique,
of the id inlt. the whole ifiand, (except Fort
Bourbon) was in potTeffion of the British,
who had then 70 pieces of cannon and 14
taortars playing on the fort, which was de
fended only by 400 menâ-the colored people
having delivered themselves up, on condition â¢
of their leaders being permitted to go to A

LONDON, January 21.
It is remarkable that the Portuguese,
who, for very many years, have not met
an enemy in the field, lhould have beat the
French the very firlt time they came to
blows with them ; and, though raw in
arms, made those troops fly, who had
more than once routed the best troops df
Spain. But this is an age of novelties.
The following particulars of the action
in which they were thus fuccefsful is too
authentic, and too glorious to the troops,
and to some of our countrymen who acted
with them, not to be made known to the
public.âThe letter which brought the in
telligence to England was dated the 14th
of December.
" The Povtuguefe troops recently re
lieved General Ricardos from a difagrea
bk dilemma, in which he had fuffered the
French to out-general him. The French
having taken a circuitous march, had fe
cuied a post, find fortified it on and near
a bridge, in a defile where the General

with the other troops, and by which
means he was cut off. General Ricardos
was consequently reduced to the necessity
of cutting his way through, or laying

Forbes, they (the Portiigaeft j ioft not Â» I

The Firjl American Edition.
THE grand principle of if right
ly understood, is the only basis on which
uaiverfal justice, sacred order, and perfect
freedom, can be firmly built, and permanent
ly secured. The v:ew of it exhibited in this
essay, at the'fame time that ir reprefles the
insolence of office, the tyranny of pride, and
the outrages of opjareiiion'; confirms, a the
most forcible manner, the lieceflity of subor
dination, and the just demands of lawful au
thority. So far indeed, loosening the
bands of society, that it maintains inviolate,
every natural and every civil diftinftion,
draws more closely every f'ocial tie, unites in
one harmonious and jullly proportioned sys
tem, and brings men together on the even
ground of the inherent rights of human na
ture, of reciprocal obligation, and of a com
mon relation to the community.
