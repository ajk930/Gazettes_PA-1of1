LONDON, April t.
It was yesterday confidently reported;
but on what authority we have not disco
vered, that to fill up the sum of our mis
fortunes, America, Sweden, and Den
mark have united with the French, anc
declared war against this country.
Letters from Modena of the 25th ult,
state, that two Neapolitan vessels had late
ly been carried prizes into the port of Ge
noa by a French privateer, and that the
late disturbances which happened in th<
play-house of Genoa had been occasioned
by the democratic Patricians, who do eve
ry th "ng they can in bitter to abolish noLi
hty in that Republic.
The French have procured a number
of recruits from the banks of the river
Queich, Blies, and Saarâdetachments of
these young Germans are daily sent off for
their armies in the interior parts of France,
and those which are stationed on the fron
tiers of Italy.
The countess of Rufdelftadt, the firft
peifon implicated in the eonfpiracy against
the life of the duke regent of Sweden, on
the day of her arreftation, delivered to
the duke regent a written confefilon of her
crime. She would long ago have received
judgment, if it had not been for her obfti
[ nacy in not discovering her accomplices.
The total number of French pi ifoners
in England, Scotland and Ireland, by the

5,029.
The French have set a price on the head
of General Paoli.

" After the oral i eprefentation which

To thiS-ts added in the Danilh Gazette
that Count Bernftorf haying recommended
the immediate invert igalionof this aitair to
theDntch chancery, the publiiher was sum
moned before the council of state : and
th&t the curiosity of the public was at the
highest pitch to know the issue of these
proceedings, especially as the Briti(l) Mi
nister had been supported in his demand
of fatisfaftion, by the repfefentations of
the other foreign Ministers.
Young Count Wurmbrand, long fluf
fing from the army of the Netherlands,
has lately written from Liile to his friends
at VienÃa, where he is, with four other
Imperial officers. They have liberty to
walk about the town, and receive their
remittances of money without interrupti
on. They daily attend a two hours lec
ture upon the rights of Ntan, and the
causes of the.presentwwasr f with the Pa
rilian newspapers, &c. It is added that
none of the Aulirians arc forced into the
French service.
April 8.
Yesterday captain Cook arrived at
the admiralty office with dispatches
from Lord Hood. The contents of
these dispatches, we understand to be,
that his Lordship finding the French in
Baftia too ft'rong to be attacked, with any
profpedt of success, by the force at his
disposal, and being ill supported by the
Corficans, had re-embarked tiie troops.
The King of Prussia now finds, that
the fafety of his crown, and the rSprefen
tation of the dearest interests of his peo
ple do not depend on the conquest of
France -The Empress of Russia has also
notified to the court of Vienna, that as
long as the Porte with Sweden and Den
mark, (hall continue to excite her appre
hensions, (lie cannot give her promised aid
to the Confederacy!
The Flanders MAil which arrived this
morning, brings no news of any import
ance. Two mefTt ngers came over in the
fame Packet, but nothing material had
Occurred on the Frontier.
The emperor was expected to reach
Brnflels on Wednesday last. His Inaugu
ration as Duke of Brabant, takes place
in a few days, after which it is believed
he will visit the armies.
By letters from America we learn, that
fix fail of French (hips of the line and
five frigates, apparently the squadron that
Earl Howe chafed, are faftly arrived in
the Chefapeak. They had one million
four hundred thousand pounds sterling,
in specie, on board, which they have fafe
ly lodged in the Bank of Philadelphia,
for the purpose of buying provisions and
llores.
This wealth, thus sent to America,
not enly invigorates their agriculture and
manufactures, but it tends to make them
maritime. They will themselves be the
carriers of these cargoes to France ; and
thus does the present war, through the
madness of Great Britain, advance the
United States of America half a century
in arts, commerce and wealth.
[It does one's heart good to find foreign
nations fcoMing about the prosperity of
Americaâand it is no mean aigument in
favor of peace and the measures of our
government.]
April 13.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer, in
his new bill refpedting the Crown lands,
purposes, among other regulations, to
grant immediate leases of 90 years to all
holderj qf Crown leases, which is confi
dired as a liberal boon to them, the ut
ir oft extent of all former leases being no
more than 40. According to the mod
moderate calculation, the crown lands, if
brought to market, and funded, would
produce an annual income of 400,000!.
The late indecision of the King of Prus
sia has produced a number of contradic
tory reports; but in contradiÂ£lion to state.
ments in the foreign Gazettes we are as
sured that the zealous co-operation of
his Pruflian Majesty with an army of
80,000 men, is effectually secured to the
general cause.
The Dutch troops under the command
of the Hereditary Prince of Orange,
have approached Phillippevill.- so very
cltifely, that the garrison of that place
iias only paflage left free to a place where
its cavalry used to water the horses. The
French are now reduced to catch the rain
water in cisterns for that purpole.
On the 26th ult. at day-bveak, the
Republicans attempted to throw a consi
derable convoy into that besieged fortrels.
The Dutch attacked the convoy and the
escort with such vigour, that both fell in
to their hands. The French escort coh
fifted of 200 men, of whom 13 were kil
led, and three others wounded.
Yesterday we received the Paris papers
up to the sth instant. They contain no
thing of much importance, except the
perfect acquiescence of the populace in
the arrest and trial of Danton. The
powsr exercised by the Committees of
Public and General Safety is at present so
defpotie, and so formidable, that no man,
in or out of the Convention, dares to
hint a doubt of the propriety of whate
ver they choose to order.
Ihe Prince of Saxe Cobourgj as Ma
jor Maitland dated in the House of Com
mons ob Thursday, is to be superseded.
The Emperor is to take the command of
the Combined Armies in person, and to
be affilted by a Military Council, at the
head of which is General Mack. Such
is the progress of a war against the people
who, twelve months ago, were represent
ed as incapable of finding troops, arms,
ammunition, or provisions! All the great
Generals hitherto employed to subdue
them, the King of Prussia, the Duke of
Brunfwick, General Wurmfer, the Prince
of Saxe Cobourg, have either retired or
been dismissed. The Emperor, of Ger
many, a* if contending for his last (lake,
is brought from his amusements at Vien
na, to assume in appearance the command
of the army, that men of abilities, not
men of rank, may be enabled to direst
its operation.
The duke of York's plan for raising a
corps of waggoners for the army on the
Continent is like to take immediate ef
fect. Of the 600 men that it is to consist
of, 240 are already raised, 120 of whom
embarked at Gravefend the week before .
last for Oftend, and 120 more on Monday
last. Government find them in clwatlis,
boots, &c. they are to have is. 6d. per
day subsistence, with liberty of returning
to England at the expiration of one year.
Yesterday morning advice was received
at the admiralty office, that four French
privateers, which have been cruizing in
the chops of the channel for some time,
watching the motions of our ships, were
captured by his majesty's cruizers and sent
into Scilly.
A dreadful instrument of deftruftion,
contrived to throw ten bombs in a minute,
has been lately invented by a foreigner ;
a model of which has been (hewn and
proved before the prince of Wales and se
veral other persons of diftinftion. A
public fubfeription, patronized by his roy
al highness and the duke of York, is be
gun, for conftrudting one upon a scale
fufficient to throw bombs of very large
dimensions.
Accounts from Madrid, of the 17th
of February, state, that on the sth of
that month an important engagement had
taken place between the allied troops and
the French, in the vicinity of Andaie, in
Biscay. The Spanish general, Caro, hav
ing attacked the French, in order to dis
lodge them ftom an important battery they
had erected not far from Fontarabia, the
latter refitted with such vigor that the
Spaniards were forced to retreat, with the
loss of seven hundred killed, wounded and
prisoners.
The brother of Cardinal, late Abbe
Maury, has lately been put to death at
Paris by the guillotine.
April 12,
There is a rumor here, that the Em
peror of Morocco, gained over by French
money, means to attack the Spanish set
tlements on the coast of Africa. This
will be a very troublesome diversion, al
though at this moment the marine of
Spain is in good condition, and able to
repress the piracies of the Moors.
HOUSE OF COMMONS.
April 9.
The House having refalved itfelf into a
committee of ways and means, and the
accounts of the surplus of the consolidated
fund for the last quarter up to April 5,
1794, being referred to,
Mr. Pitt said, it was with the highest
fatisfaftion that he infortned the commit
tee, that the surplus submitted to their
consideration amounted to something about
231,0001. the whole quarter yielded
2 7b,0001. more than the last quarter of
the preceding year, ending the sth of A
pril, 1793, the produce of all the perma
nent taxes for the kft year ending the sth
of Apiil 1794> he said waS only about
ioo.ood. kfs than the income of 1793,
the riioft productive year the finances ot
the country ever experienced. This he
represented atf a very flourifhing account,
when it is considered that the firft yeai ot
a vÂ«fr is always mo(t deficient, and that
commercial failures, arising from accident
al causes, dillinil from the war, had ren
dered this year particularly distressing.
He then moved, " That the ftirplus of
the consolidated fund, amounting to
232,0001. and ending on the sth of April
1794, be applied to the services of the
pfefent year"âwhich was agreed to, and
the refolations ordered to be reported on
Friday. â¢
Adjourned.
DANTON,
The influence of this distinguished cha
ra&er, now totally destroyed, has been
on the decline for some time. The me
morable fitting of the Jacobins on the 3d
of December afforded the firft public
proof of this decaying popularity.
Having made a declaration, that the
Constitution ought to sleep while the peo
ple were preparing to overwhelm their
enemies, Doupe de L'Oife reprobating
this doctrine, Danton was reduced to the
necelTity of entering into a defence cf his
condu&, and of confeffing, amidst the
murmurs of the Jacobins, that recent
events might have occasioned good Patri
ots to fufpeft him.
It was at tljat period, and immediately
after Danton had conclyded his defence,
that Roberfpiere commenced a review of
the causes that had produced such suspi
cion.âThe alledged emigration of Dan
ton into Switzerland, his feigned illness,
his inordinate ambition, which seemed to
aim at the regency or diftatorfhip, his
former intimacy with Dumourier, his
want of activity in oppofingthe Brifiotine
part âall these circumllances were alluded
to. Robespierre, however, concluded
his speech, by declaring that Danton had
been calumniated.
Notwithftauding this event, no cordial
friendfhip subsisted between Roberfpierre
and Danton, for they were rivals.
To oppfe the increasing power of the
former in the Jacpbin Club, and in the
committee of public fafety, the latter at- 1
tached himfelf to the Cordeliers, whom,
by secret means, he endeavoured to Â£xalt
above the Jacobins.
It is fufpefted that Hebert acted under I
his direction, that he was the concealed
author of that conspiracy, which involved
the actors in ruin.
If this suspicion be well founded, it
will scarcely be deemed an extraordinary
Gircumftance, that the overthrow of the
Cordeliers foonld produce the deftru&ion
of the power of of Danton.
Cammille Defmoulins has long been
fufpefted, and so long ago as the month
of December, he was denounced, as
having been the intimate friend of Mira
beau, the Lameths and Cuftine.
Lacroix's attachment to stock-jobbing,
and some facts which were disclosed in
the evidence against the Hcbertifts, and
which tended to criminate Phillippeaux,
have produced the arrest of these two de
puties.
Danton is a mart of blunt manners, and
of a boisterous eloquence.â" His form,"
according to Dr. Moore, " is coarse and
uncommonly robustâhis manner fierce
and rudeâhe speaks with the voice of a
Stentor, declaims on the blefiings of free
dom with the arrogance of a tyrant, and
invites to union and friendfhip'with the
frown of an enemy."
NATIONAL CONVENTION.
Sitting of March 29.
The committee of legislation presented
a revised plan of the law against monopo
lizers, which was agreed. The principal
articles areâ
Wholesale dealers and manufa&urcrs
(hall be bound to declare, within the de

residence.
2. The quantity, quality, and nature

A correTpondent obTerves, that the Se
nate could not have given a more une
quivocal proof of their sincere deuie to
preserve to the United States the precious
blessing of peace, than in the late ap
pointment of Mr. Jay, as Envoy Extra
ordinaly to the Britilh Court. And it
should he mentioned among the heroic
ads of the President's life, that regani
lefs of the insidious politics of his native
state, he did on this momentous occation,
with a degree of firmnefs worthy the
Chief Magistrate of the United States,
select a man in all respects well qualuie
for the important trull.
The President is a military man, and
cannot be afraid of warâan honcftand therefore appreciates the advantage
of peace.
In the person of Mr. Jay is concentred
the qualities which an Envoy Extraor
dinary, at this awful crisis of our affairs,
/hould poHcfs. He is indisputably a
great civilian, an able negociator, perfua
iive, though firws ill his manners, irreiifti
ble iu his eloquence, and finifhed in his
personal accomplifhrhents. Add to this
his place of residence, a circumftanfce on
common occaflons not worth mentioning,
but id the present inllance, and in the
present state of American politics, even
this is entitled to peculiar attention. Mr.
Jay is an inhabitant of New-Yo.k, a state
Jincerely .Jcjirous of preserving peace ; her
internal lecurity as well as commercial
prdfperity are at (takeâ(he bled at every
pore from 1775 to 1753, and will always
have more lofc and leis to gain, by war,
than any other member of the union.â
Last to be mentioned, is the weight
which his judicial character may be sup
posed to give to all his official demands.
Will it be considered in the British cabi
net a trivial business which calls the
Chief-Juftice of the United States to that
Court ? Will he appear there as a solitary
American citizen making demands which
our enemies may accede to or refufe at
pleasure, as they have done heretofore ?
Or will he be viewed as the envoy of an
injured nation, clothed with the judicial
as well as miniftenal authorities of his
country? Let good citizens unite in
their prayers that the Divine Blelfing may
attend his mission, and that war, with all
its concomitant evils, may once more be
baniflied from our coasts.

France is exerting herfelf to make effec

against all attacks, the members of the
Convention, are mowing off each others
heads, with a ipirit of jeafoufy and ven

long time, almost governed the Conven

as traitors, arretted, brought before the

ipierre now rules the Convention, having
by the removal of Danton, got rid of
his competitors; and if we may indulge
conjectures, Robespierre, will foos be
difiator in fad and name, or he will fink
into his grave beneath the stroke of some
jealous rival.

In tlie Brig Fame, Capt. Hunt in 8
days from Charleften, came 20 Indian
Chiefs belonging to the Cherokee nation.
1 hey are a re r peftablc deputation from
the Cherokee Nation so Congressâtheir
bufiriefs is to form a treaty of peace and
amity wfth the United States.
Says a Correspondent, ;
The manner qf treating Societies formed â¢
for the end of censuring and checking the
Government, is very different ,in different
countries. In England the members are hunt
ed down by prosecutions. In America, pub
lic opinion is.a. mjjjler and equally effeaual
antidote against their poison. A very few
adventurers, of slippery principles, are known
to take the lead in their meetings.âThe
public knot's these leaders and rates them at
their current valueâthat is to fay, at the
rate of known rfothirtg.âBut
i.ne greater number of the members are well
disposed btit nulled citizens, i iiey are let
alone, their violent*, and delusion ire re
gretted, bu,t nobody wlfhfcs to do them any
barm. The effect of this mild forbearance
already appars. The Society and their wild
resolutions are almcft forgotten. Like othe
fanatics they droop for lack of persecution
A correspondent observes, that a long la
bored attempt to vindicate the conduit of a
lately appointed officer, and to reconcile his
nconfiftency and that of his party which ap
>eared in this paper of Wednesday, niuf
ail in its object.
His apologist admits that the blending tht
Executive And the Legif.ativLâ  departments is
as reprehensible as that of the Executi-ve and
Judicial, but juftifies the opposition of Mr.
M. to the appointment of Mr. J. on this
ground, that Mr. J. did not after his appoint
ment reGgn his office of Chief Justice, where
as Mr. M. resigned his feat in the Senate.
But the fallacy of this pretended diftincHon
is obvious.
How could Mr. J. resign before his ap
pointment r Mr. M. when he opposed the
appointment, did not certainly know what
Mr. J. would do after it. Mr. J. was Chief
Juflice when he was nominated; Mr. M.
was a Senator; the cases therefore are so
far parallel; what each would do, after the
appointment was uncertain and depended al
together on the voluntary aifl of the party.
As far as there was any thing wrong in the
appointment of the one, it was equally so
with regard to the other. Mr. M. opposed
the appointment ot Mr. J. bccaufe he was
Chief JuJiice when nominated ; and Mr. M.
acquiesced in his own nomination being Sena
tor ; on the principle admitted by the apolo
gist where is the difference; both were at
liberty, after the appointment to resign or
not. Mr. J. has not resigned; his appoint
ment was for a short period and the func
tions he was to execute would only occasion
an absence from one Court, the Supreme
Court in Au'juft: the law does not more re
quire the attendance of the Chief Justice
than of the AlTociate Judges, and it is well
known that at every session of the Supreme
Court, one or other of the AlTociate Judges
is absent. Where then is the mighty oflence
in doing that which is done twice a year by
some other of the Judges,without complaint i
Mr. M. it is true, resigned his feat in the
Senate ; but his appointment being perma
nent, his resignation was of course, and there
is no merit on his part, for had he failed tc
resign, the Legislature of Virginia could have
tonlidered the acceptance of the Embassy
as a virtual resignation and appointed a fuc
ceffor.
The apoligft has not attempted to fhevs
the confijiency of reprobating an Embassy tc
France, on the ground that no Minister oughl
to be sent to that country, when anothei
perl'on was appointed, and now accepting
that very office ; this was rather two difficul

No censure is aimed at the Executive so:

good reasons in policy for it: but it is pro

PARIS, April 3.
We learn from Marseilles that the patri- 1
ots there are to be again armed, provided
they are members of any one of the clubs.
Saliceti, in a letter from Maifeilles,
dated the 19th inft. advises, " tjhat Baftia
(till holds out, the garrison being' deter
mined to defend themselves till the last ex
tremity. The ferocious conduit of the
Englifli at St. Florent had so exasperated
the citizens of Baftia, that even the mo
derates seemed to be determined rather to
perish than fuffer these new cannibals to
plunder their houses, ravish their wives
and daughters, and cut the throats of the
aged and infirm. In a fortic the garrison
of Baftia had driven the Paolifts from the
village aL Carhnp ; Jellied a great number
of the enemy, and burned the village.
The galley, la Moselle had reached Ballia
with troops, 11,000 sacks of meal, af
fignates, and succors of every description,
after an escape from eight or nine English
(hips by which (he had been chafed. The
(hip of the line le Duquefne, and the
frigate la Fauvette, had arrived at Toulon
with two Spani(h prizes: at the latter
place the armament was going on with the

LONDON, April jâl3.
Our papers from Paris, received yes
terday down to the 29th ult. are so far
important, that they prove the preponder
ating influence of Robespierre and the
committees of public fatety and welfare,
who now hold the fnpreme and uncontefted
authority in France. A better proof can
not be given of their uncontrouled power,
thai? their Having so early disbanded the
whole revolutionary army, which was rais
ed under the influence of the clubs in Pa
ris, and was subservient to their will. As
this army had shewn some symptoms of
disapprobation to the late executions, and
had refufed to congratulate the Conventi
on on the discovery of the late conspiracy,
the firft ast of Robespierre's power has

The time, fatal to Danton, is at length
arrived ; He falls with the Cordeliers, of
whom, originally, he was the firft sup
port ; and no doubt but that if Marat,
who was his agent, and directed his con
vulsive motions, were alive at this moment,
he would partake in the disgrace of his
friend. Perhaps, ih the day when Dan

Marat will be dragged from the Pantheon,

Momoro, who was laately guillotined

The Public are cautioned to
' beware of counterfeited Fine Dollar Bills of
the Bank of the United States, and Twenty
" Dollar Bills of the Bank of North America,
f Jeveral of which have appeared in circulation
e within a few days pajl; they are a good ge
, neral imitation of the genuine Bills, Cut may
j be dylmguijhed by the following
MARKS.
\ Five Dollar Jiills of the Bank erf the
a United States.
f ALL that have appeared have the letter F.
c for their Alphabetical Mark.
1 The Texture of the Paper is thiElcer and
whiter and it takes the ink. more freely than
s the genuine paper,
, & The O. in the word Company is smaller
than the M. and other letters of that word,
so that a lineextended from the top of the O,
to touch the top of the M. would extend con.
â¢ fiderably above the range of the whole word.
In the word United the lettwrsare narrow
erand closer together than the reft of the bill
The i and yi<ithe word promise are not
parallel, the much more forward
than the i.
The engraving is badly executed,the lliokes
of alt the Letters are stronger and the devii e
in themargin particularly ismuch coarser and
appears darker than in the true bills. Some
ot the counterfeits hear dale in 1791 Where
as the Bank was not in operation till Decern
ber, and 110 five dollar bills were iifued in
lhat year.
Twenty Dollar Bills of the Bank of North
America.
ALL that have appeared have the letter
B. lor their alphabetical mark.
They are printed On a paper nearly similar
to that of the couuterfeit Five Dollar Notes
above described ; the engraving is bettei exe
ucted, and they approach nearer to the ap
pearance of the genuine bills.
The fine ruled lines through the word Twen
ty, in the body of the bill, are in number thir
teen in the genuine bills, and but twelve in
the counterfeits.
The word Company is much like the fame
word in the Five Dollar Bills as defer ibed 2-
bove, the 0 being less than the I*, and others
following.
1 There is no stroke to the t in the word North
whereas in the genuine bills the stroke is well
defined.
The letters ent in the word Twenty, to the
left hand at the bottom, do not' come down to
the line, but are so cut as to give an irregular
appearance to the word, the Tw and the_y go
ing below them.
The iignature J, Nixon, has the appear
ance of being written with lamb-black and
oil, and differs from other inks used in
printing the bills and the cashier's lignature.
It is supposed these forgeries were commuted
in fomeof the Southern States, as all the coun
terfeits thai have appeared, have come from
thence, and two persons have been appiehcnd
ed in Virginia,on suspicion of being the author
of them.
Therewardof ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS
will he paid to any Person or Persons who lhall
discover and prosecute to conviction the feveial
offenders of the following descriptions or any
of them, viz.
The person or persons, who manufactured
the paper on which the Bills aie primed.
The person or persons, who engraved the
plates.
The printer or printers, of the bills.
livery person who has acted as a principal in
any other way, in the counterfeiting and utter
ing the said bills.

T'HEgrand principle of Equality, if right
s ly underflood, is the only bafi's on which
universal justice, sacred order, and perfect
freedom, can be firmly built, and permanent
ly secured. The view of it exhibited in this
eJTay, at the fame time that it represses the
infoJeace of office, us - smJ
the outrages of oppression ; confirms, i'n the
mofl forcible manner, the necessity of fubor
di nation, and the just demands of 1
thorny. So far indeed, from loosening the 4
bands of society, that it maintains inviolate,
every natural and every civil distinction,
dtaws.more closely every social tie, unites in
one harmonious and justly proportioned sys
tem, and brings men together on the even
ground of the inherent rights of human na
ture, of reciprocal obligation, and of a com
mon relation to the community.
