WHAT IS THIS ?
DEMOCRACT and Arijlocracy, what
do they mean ? What do they mean ! why
they mean every thing that is bad : A
Democrat is a Devil, and an Ariflocrat is
the great Devil of Devils, both of them
pernicious to society, destroyers of peace
on earth'!âfhedders of human blood !â
harbingers of misery !âcaterers of death !
âand bellows blowers and fuel-mongers
to fire everlasting! " Shocking!
What a (hocking picture is this?" fays the
gentle reader* " Can this be true ? Is this
writer mad ; or does lje mean to tell the
world an infamous iie ?' Softly, my dear
fellow, before thou condemneft this dread]
ful writer let him alk thee a few questions.
Art thou an Arijlocrat ?âThen wilt thou
not allow,nay,doft thou not wi/h that every
Democrat was exterminated from the face
Of the earth ? And why do you wifli it ?
" Because," fay you, " the Democratsâ
the S ans Culottes are Devils incarnate*
they ought to be sent home to Hell, there
toroaft in fire and Brimflone to all eterni
ty." Art thou a Democrat ? Then wi't
thou not allow that every Ariflocrat mail,
woman, and child ought immediately to
be brought to the Guillotine, their heads
fevered from their bodies and their fault
(pardon me for using the vulgar term,
foul, I know not the philosophical name)
their fouls reduced to annihilation ? " Cer
tainly," fayeft thju.âHere then we have
the judgment of Democrats and Ariflocrats
upon each other. From such judges,
Good Lord deliver us! Rt a !er, Art thou
a christian ? Then thou v. ill fufpedt those
beings, who in cold blood can deliberate
ly murder helpless women and children*
though they may be in human fliape, not
to be men but wild beasts and devils. li
ven these appellations will hardly give an
idea of their enormities : The Wild beasts
of the sorest would be ashamed of the con
duct of the Sans Culottes in France { and
at the conduit of some of tht Emperors
arid Kings of Europe, even the Devils
themselves must blush. '
From the above I would riot have it
thought that every one who is called an
Ari/ie rat or Democrat is really a devil.
There may be many who bear the appella
tions, that may be good men. But let
any one avowhimfelf an Ariflocrat or De
mocrat, and atterppt to jullify tyranny and
murder, whether committed by the many
or the f. w, the mob or the monarch ; I

NATION A CONVENTION.
March 8.
General CVtaux, in a letter complained
that he had been kept 74 days in irons,
without a trial, and requelted his speedy
judgment.âHe lamented that he could
not go and (hed his blood to save the re
publicâReferred to the committee of ge
neral fafety.
In the name of the commission of cus
toms, and of the united committees of
public fafety, commerce, legislation, ai)d
marine, Bourdon presented the following
plan of a decree, which was adopted:
1. The treaties of navigation and com
merce exiftingbetween Fiance and those
nations with whom (he is at peace, shall
be executed in their form and tenor,
without changing them in the lead by
the present decree.
If. All nations, v.hose govermcnt is at
peace with the republic, have a right
to the justice and friendfhip of the
French nation. All those foreign nati
ons who commit no hostilities against
France, shall be treated in the lame
manner:
111. In all those ports and places of
France which are not interfered by a
foreign territory, the fame laws, de
crees aud tariffs, shall be observed.
IV. The foreign vessels, and the Flench
vessels coming from abroad, shall not
be permitted to anchor in the islands of
Corsica, Crtfix, Bouin, La Croifiere,
Noirmoutier, Ifle-Dieu, Billifle, U(h
ant, the Island of the Mountain, Mole
Nehedic, l(k des Saints, the Isles of
Rhe, Oberon, and other great or small
islands, unless they are in flrefs, or ob
liged to come to anchor.
V. The commodities and produftiotis of
territory, of filhing, and fait, drawn
from the places denominated by article
IV. shall pay no duty in the Fren:h
ports ; but no manufactured goods shall
be imported from those places in France.
VI. French (hips may be dispatched from
the places pointed out in article IV.
from one harbor to another, the fame
as for a French harbor.
VII. Those articles, the importation of
which is lawful from the United States
of America to the French colonies,
shall not be exported from the said colo
nies to France.
The convention having ordered a writ
ten hand bill to be read, beginning thus:
" Sans Culottes, It is timeâorder the ge
neral to be beat and concluding with,
" Because I speak truth itfelf;" Referred
the said bill to the public accuser of the
revolutionary tribunal of Paris, charging
him to make, without delay, the ftrifteft
search after the authors, accomplices, dis
tributers or flickers of the said hand-bill.
March 9.
Bourbotte sent the Correspondence of
the rebels of La Vendee ; and adds to his
letter the following paragraphs :
" Among those papers, some are ex
tremely precious ; they show the villainy
of certain individuals who sported among
us the most energetic patriotism, and cor
refpooded at the fame time with chiefs of
the Banditti.
" Several among them have already ex
piated their signal treachery with theit
heads. If the committee to whom these
pieces are referred examines them atten
tively, it will find that there are many
more traitors to be brought to condign
punishment.
"I also fend back the Seal which the
Felrconftituted Superior council of Cha
tillon used for its a&s, and the plate with
which they fabricated falfe aflignats."
A deputation from several popular soci
eties from the southern departments, com
plained that Carras and Freron, the repre
ntatives of the people who helped so
much in promoting the fecaptiirc of Tou
lon, had been dtnounced and recalled.
Freron immediately after ascended the
Tribune, and spoke as follows: " Citi
zens, we are jull arrived from the army in
Italy: Slander preceded us to this hall ;
but we earnestly supplicate you to pre
judge nothing, till you have heard the sa
cred accents of truth from our lips, and
difcomfited the mancevres of those intrig
ing men who wanted to struggle againit
the national Reprefenfation, and to debase
it. We demand of you to be heard on

UNITED STATES.
ALEXANDRIA, May 13.
Copy of a Letter from a gentleman in Phi
ladelphia, to his friend in this town.
Philadelphia, May 1 ft, 1794.
Dear Sir,
AS you have been pleased to request
my opinion on the present state of our po-,
litical lituation, I cannot refufe to comply
with your wishes, however incompetent I
feel myfelf to develope it fully.
The transactions in Europe certainly
exhibit the most wonderful scene of things
to be found in the annals of man. They
can be measured by no events of ancient
or modern times. They form an unique
in the biftory of the world : and in what
they will terminate, no human wifdomcan
conclude. I heartily pray that the result
may be a melioration of the condition of
mankind, and general peace aud happi
ness to the human race. I particularly
pray that the storms of France may fjon
subside ; and that we may soon fee this
wonderful people in the tranquil enjoy
ment of peace, liberty, and good govern
ment, the just reward of heroes, and which
ft is our happiness to possess.
In this tremendous agitation of human
things, the United States are placed in a
most.delicate and critical situation. A situ
ation which calls for the firineft courage
and most deliberate prudence. To support
our dignity without riflhing into the in
calculable calamities of war ; and to main
tain peace which is filling our country with
riches, and every day making prodigious
additions to our (Ircngth without humili-,
at ion, is the difficult talk imposed on our
government. Happiiy we have at the.
head of our administration, a man, who
in war, having defended lis with the shield
of Mars, seems in peace, to be guided by
the wisdom of Minerva.
The conduCt of the court of Great
Britain, has certainly 'been infxplieablv
mysterious, and in some inltances, has dis
covered Itrong tokens of deep-rooted ha
tred, and hostility towards this country.
Often have my refentraents urged ir.e to
measures of passionate re*enge: Often to
favor the prohibition of the importation
of articles the growth and manufacture
of Great Britain and Ireland, and the se
questration of debts due from American
citizens to Britilh fubjt&s, measures,
which, though proposed in the House of
Representatives, seem to have been dictat
ed rather by a generous indignation, than
by calm and deliberate prudepce. But
public bodies, as well as individuals, have
their honest resentments; and it is as diffi
cult for the one as for the other* under
circumstances of extreme irritation, per
fectly to controul their passions ; nor are
either to be censured, if they sometimes
yield to their power. However, it is a
truth, of which every man's experience
must convince him, that passion is not a
good counsellorâthat it frequently leads
us into errors of which we bitterly repent
for the whole course of our lives: and
when we are molt provoked, we ought
most to fufpedt its advice, and fly to the
aid of reafoo, which will, of course, al
ways give us good counsel. If this is so
necelTary m individuals, it is (till more ne
cellary in public servants, on whose con
duct not merely their pcrfonal interests,
but the fafety, the peace, and the happi
neis of the whole people depends. They
ought for ever to banish from ther hearts,
lo mdifcreet an adviser, and confuting tea
ion only, pursue in the most prudent and
temperate way, measures which ftiall ap
pear belt calculated, on mature reflection,
to guard the public peaceâthe greatc) of
human bleJmgsâMd to eftabliffi the gener
haPP'Â»f- It mult be confefled, how
ever, to be extremely difficult under the
tain Â«tf Â° f Â°. Ur l3tC in j uHeS ' to Ob
tain all that patience of character which I
have defenbed to be so necelTary. Per
haps it does not belong to the nature of
I will, howevtr, endeavor in the fol
lowing observations, to give you the le
fult of my most difpaflionate . reflections
on the present ihteielting crisis of our
nation.
I have ever viewed the court of Great
Britain as hostile to the prosperity of the
United,Stites. For it may be regarded
as a fad, founded on human nature, that
thr person, who, deliberately and maliciouj
ly injures another, never forgives him, be
cause the injured party is a continual me
mento of his folly and vice, and acts as a
perpetual goad to his confciencc. Apply
ing this principle to the court of Great
Britain, I am led to believe that thair
unjust and unfuccefsful attempt on our li
berties, still rankles in their bosom. Be
sides they cannot fnppofe that we can.
heartily forget the injuries they did us.â
And it is certain that we have not forgiv
en nor forgotten them. Consequently
there exists a mutual hatred and jcaloufly
between the court of Great Britain and.
this country. Yet, notwithstanding the
unfriendly disposition of the British gov
ernment towards us ; and our antipathy
to it, it is certainly the interest of the
people of the United States, and of the
people of Britain, to maintain a peacea
ble and friendly commercial intercourse
with each other. And it is more our in
tereji than theirs.
I have never been surprised, that the
British court regarding us as a people ini
micaltoit, should view with pain our grow
ing wealth and strength ; particularly the
increase of our commerce and marine im
portance.
They must have seen with peculiar re
gret, these things effected principally by
the agescy of Britiih capital. British
gold and British fubjefts were continually
flowing in, to improve and people the U
nited States, at the cxpence of their na
tion. Observing these things and regard
ing us as an unfriendly nation, it was na
turally to be expedted, that the British
court would be inclined to check a com
merce which was undermining their
strength ; and that they would be tempt
ed to fei/.e the firft colourable pretextâ
to annihilate a navigation which threaren
ed to rival their own. Having the com
mand of the ocean, it is unfortunately too
'much in their power to accomplish such
dcfigns ; and that they have meditated
such a policy, is probable from the recent
tranfaftions in the Weft Indies. But the
very reasons which may have suggested
such a policy to the British court ought
to have induced us to have permitted the
commetce to have remained in the slate in
which it was. Under this view of the re
lative interests and dispositions of the two
countries, I ever thought commercial re
ftriftions, dire&ly pointed againlt Great
Britain, impolitic. They might prompt
the court to execute plans of mifchief a
gainst us, which they probably only wait
ed for a pretext to attempt. By leaving
to the people of Great Britain the bene
fits of the commerce they enjoyed, I
wish to interest them in the preservation of
our peace, and to make them a counter
pbife to any hoflile designs their court
might meditate against us. lam appre
hensive that a systematic plan to turn our
commerce from that country, would be
considered by the people of Great Bri
tain, as a proof of implicable hatred to
them, and regarding us no longer as
friends, but enemies, they might be in
duced to support with zeal, any attempts
which their cabinet might be inclined to
make, to distress and weaken us.
" When I recoiled what immense por
tions of British capital, till the late inter
ruption of our commerce, were daily sent
to be veiled in the vacant lands of this
country, and other important and perma
nent improvements : when I recoiled how
many of the fubjeds of his Britannic ma
jelly, were not only fending their money
to add to the riches, but coming themselves
to encreafe the number and force of the
United States. I recoiled a commerce
which was peaceably and gradually under
mining the strength of the Britith empire,
and raising our own on its ruins.
iC Ihe wealth accumulated by their a -
mazing industry, and commerce Teemed
destined to improve and aggrandize the
United States. Under such circumstan
ces, if we consulted our revenge only, we
ought to desire nothing but peace, and
the commerce we lately enjoyed. The
truth is, time fights for us. Time fights
against them. If we will trust to time,
we shall find him a powerful friend, who
will render us conquerorsârich conquer
ors.
The Brittffi mtrft have too much
sagacity to.be inattentive to all these circum.
fiances ; and viewing, us as an enemy and
rival nation, they may have felt a disposition
to check the commercial inteicourfe between
the two countries, and may probably be in
clined to use the empire of the ocean, which
they poflefs, to strike a hlpw which would
put our navigation ba.k for twenty years:
It is probable, therefore, that the Britilh court
â¢would not have been displeased with the pas
sage of the bill lately rejefled by the Senate,
to prohibit the importion of articles of the
growth or manufacture of Great Britain or
IrelandâFirst, because t',;ey may wifli to

The Militia.
A we'll organized and difciplinc'd militia,
has been long acknowledged the palladium
of a free country. In that fituatiori, the
millitia are equally ready to refill any en
croachments on their rights as mun, or
exteufion of power, in their local govern
ment ; and to protedl their country from
invasion and plunder, by extraneous ar
mies.
On Tuesday last, there was a g'eneral
examination of the equipments of the mi
litia, throughout the commonwealth, and
we have the pleasure to learn, they were,
in general,- well furiiifhed, agreeaLly to
the prescription of the law. The Button
regiment, hy the unremitted exertions of
the commanders of the different wards, ap
peared in complete uniform. Too much
praise cannot be b-ftowed on those, who,
without profped of reward, and to the
injury of their private bulincfs, have placed
the militia info refpeftable a f;tuat.ion ;
apd to those who havegeneroufly fubferib
ed to this laudable purppfc. The compa
nies of Captain's Homer and Johnson,
appeared with elegant new flaftdards.

The annals of modern history, perhaps do
not record so brilliant and glorious a eon
queft as the taking of Mart'nique ; from
the landing of the troops o 1 the 6th ot
February not 11 moment was loft, and in
less than fix weeks every quarter of the is
land was in pofleffion of the Britifli; the
fort of Calabafle was stormed, St. Pierre,
Trinite, Le Cros Morns, Cul de Sac, de
Cohee, Cafe Navire, were taken with a ra
pidity incredible ; Gener :1 Belgarde's camp
llormed and taken ; the ft rang and regular
fortified Fort Louis llormed ; and lattly,
the hitherto deemed impregnable, Fbrt
Bourbon surrendered at discretion; the
unanimi'y that has subsisted between the
soldiers and sailors, has no example in the
annals of Britifli history.
BERMUDA, April 5.
In the Southern Colonies of America
we are told the national cockade is worn
generally ; in the other States they border
nearly to madness ; clubs are held fimiliar
to the Jacobins in France ; and <ve are in
formed that some guillotines are a> a ually
arrived in the States. Town and field meet
ings have been held in many parts, all of
which breathe the greatest refentmyii to the
English, and threaten deftruflion to that
nation whom they generally suppose to be
no more than a small island, and easy to be
conquered.
PHILADELPHIA,
MAY 20,
Yesterday in the House of Reorefcntativ."!
of the United States, Mr. Sedgwick callcd
up the bill, some time since reported by him
puri'uant to orders of the hoiile tor r.ai/ingi
orgamzidg, and equipping an additional pro
â¢vifional military force âThe firlt fetSiort of
which fpe ifies the number of men thus to
be raised viz. 25,000 âThis ieÂ£Mon after
some debite was ftruc!: out âMr. Sedgwick
then moved the follow ..g as a fubflitulc for
the firft fc&iee â" That there fh a ll be raised
upon the terms and conditions hereinafter
mentioned, an additional proviiionr.l military
fore, to consist of non-commiP
fioned officers, privates and musicians, to-Â£' _.ar with a proper proportion of commif-
Joned officers. After further debate, this
motion wa likewise negativcd ; and the whole
bill fell of courle.
'i he house sac till a late hour, debating on
the hill for laying duties on inuff, tobacco,
and loaf sugarâa motion to rejedt the billon
Ls firft reading,was at length negatived, and
the bill referred to the committee of ti*e
whole this day.
THEATRE.
The performance at the Theatre to-mor
row evening promises much gratification to
the public. The Weft Indian is a piece of
well known merit, and when aliilted by
the maftcrly abili*i-S of Mr. Lbal>n:rs
end other performers of merit, will .un
doubtedly render the highest fatislaeiion.
The consideration moreover of rewarding
a petfenmir of li.s m rit, whose exer
tions to pleak, have been so diitingudhed,
will doubt Ida be a very powerful motive
in attracting a refpedabie audience. â
We can fay little of the Pantomime, only
tha; in the general character of Harlequin,
Mr. Chalmers is said not to have left an equal
behind him.

PORTSMOUTH, May 10.
Arrived here on Wednesday lad, the
brig Betty, John Salter, Jim. matter, in
48 days from Da.t 1110 m h,( Eng. )Captairi
Salter communicates the followinginlereft
ing particulars âThat two days previous
to his leaving Dartmouth, it was currently
reported, that the French had taken Guern
feyanJ Jersey:âthat the day h- left that
place, other corroborating accounts of the
lame taÂ£t had Been receivedâmuch credit
was'given to the intelligence by many in
Dartmouthâthat there was a very hot
press in molt of t'h - Briiiifh Ports, and that
orders had been HRied to double the militia;
That about 25 fail of the line had failed
From Breit, a variety of conjectures were
formed of their destination, among which
tiiat, they had gone to the Well-Indies,
with a new to recapture some of their if
larids was the molt prevailing. Capt. Sal
ter inform that Capt. M'Qaoid in the
fchooiier L'ttle John of Baltimore bound
to Bremen, Capt. Ramirsage, in the Brig
Mavv Ann of Philadelphia, hound to Fal
mouth had put into Dartmouth in distress,
oc'cafioned by had weather which they had
met with on their passageâthe latter had
received orders from London to proceed to
.1 Amsterdam.
Capt. Salter has favored us with Eng.
lifh papers to the 20th of March, from
which after a careful perusal, the following
extracts are feledied as the mÂ«ft material:
LONDON, March 17.
Intelligence is received, that the French
have for the present changed their inten
tiorsof visiting, Great Britain, firlt in
tending the conqned of the IfLn 1 of Jer
sey. The force is collected at St. Maloes;
the number a>Tiounced is 10, coo men.
The force at Je. fey confills of the 63d
regiment, which is 600 llrong ; about 800
royalills in Rrrtifh pay; five companies of
invalids; and about4ooo militia.
A letter from Lyons, has the following
curious paragraph : " Jean Baptilta Vic
torie Guillotine, M. D. formerly of Ly
ons, was lately among the multitude who
have been executed here : he was charged
with having corresponded with perfojis at
Turin. It is an extraordinaiv thing that
he (hould fuffer death by an inltrument of
his own invention. He died with great
relu&ance; and declared, that when he
produced his instrument to the world, it
was from motives of humanity alone !"
On the the 13th ult. the grand arsenal
of Corunna was burnt down. Sixty per
sons perilhed in the conflagration, and 30
others were dangerously burnt. It is sup
posed to have been set 011 fire by the
French refugees, four of whom are taken
lip, on suspicion.
By an American gentleman who left
Brest on Friday lad we learn, that theie
were thirty-one fail, besides a great num
ber of frigates lying at single anchor, rea
dy to put to sea at the fhoiteft warning.
"hey were all apparently in excellent con
dition.
Their supposed object is for the present
to intercept if possible the Gibraltar home
ward bound fleet, which eonlids of 170
fail, and having, it is thought, a very
A rong convoy. It is to be hoped Lord
Howe's appearance will cool the ardor of
their expectations. They are now out,
and, as long as they keep the sea, the
public anxiety is not likely to be abated.
Accounts from Tuikey, received at
Vienna the 19th ult. Hate that several
Ruffian, veflels had bees captured, in ..the
Archipelago, by French frigates, in light
of Turkish men ofÂ»war, without the leaii
interference of the latter. v
The valuable French fleet of St. Do
mingo men, have got fafe into the ports
of France, under the convoy of two 74
gun ships.
It was yedfirday reported at Plymouth,
that accounts had arrived there from
France of the following fleet having failed
from Bred, for the p'.irp.ofe of making 1
defce.it on some part of this kingdom, or
Ireland, viz. 22 fail of the line, 15 fri
gates, and 117 transports, having 65,00 a
troops on board. We cannot, how-vs.,
irive the leait credit to this rumor at pre
sent.
The allied fleets assuredly remain com
plete tri alters of the Mediterranean ; 110
ships of consequence can pass in or out of
the ports either of Toulon or Marseilles,
without observation ; in consequence of
which the importation of grain, and other
necefTaries, is almolt entirely put a flop to.
ALBANY, May 12.
A gentleman of refpeftability, from
Skeenfborough, informs us, that the arti
cle which has, appeared in one of the
northern papers, that our provision boats,
on Lake-Champlain, had been flopped
and detained by the British, has no foun
dation in truthâon the contrary, the in
tercourse is as free and interrupted, as at
any time heretofore. He adds, however,
as the probable cause of the report, that
there had been a continuance of south
winds on the lake for nearly three weeks,
which prevented the usual return of our
boats.
He further adds, (notwithstanding the
contrary is alferted in some of the immacu
late New-York papers) that armed veflels
are pofiiiyely fitting up at the port of St.
John's.
NEW-YORK, May 19.
By the brig Mary, Capt,, Haley, in 48
' days from Bred, we have received the
following important intelligence:
About the 20th bt March an engage
ment took place between the French and
PruiTian armies, which ended in a signal
victory on the lide of the Republicans;
in thisa&ion, glorious for the cause of li
berty, upwards of 6000 of th e slaves of
the despotic Prussian monarch bit the
dull.
Valenciennes and Conde, were aftuallv
retaken some time before Captain Haley
failed.
Victory has also crowned their efforts
againtt Spain, and many of her towns
are now in their possession. In addition
to all this, we are positively affu.ed, not
a veltige of the rebel army is left ; hav
ing ahnoft to a man paid the forfeit of
their henious crimes.
At sea success has equally favored their
druggies; several of the Cork fleet, and
29 valuable ships from the Streights bound
to London, had changed their course, and
entered different French ports with in
verted colours.
Provilions at Brest and in every town
in France, were very plenty, and an im
portant stroke was meditating against Eng
land ; eight line of battle ships with se
veral transports had failed for Jersey and
Guernsey, and had no doubt of becom
ing mallei sos those two Islands. The
Brest fleet confided of about 55 fail of
the line ; Captain BOMPARD has got
the command of a 74 gun ship.
We further learn, that the Pottuguefe
have sent a fleet to the mouth of the
Streights, to check the Algerines.
Diary.
Translated from French rewfpapers re
ceived by the Mary, Capt. Haley.
PARIS, 12 Ventofe.
Numerous crouds began to aflemble
early this morning before the doors of
the Butchers, in the fame manner as they
did some months finee before those of the
Bakers. This attradted the attention of
the Council-General of the Commune;
and it was decreed that the Halls of the
Butchers ftiould not be ope.ned before 6
o'clock in the morning ; That the Com
mandant-General, is requested, to prevent
the Citizens from alfembling before the
said hour at the doors of the butchers,
and that those who should transgress this
order, should be imptifoned in the next
guard house, during the diflribution of
prov fions.
This scarcity of pvovifions, remarks a
Sans Culottes Philosopher, is another in
dance of malevolence, which takes ad
| vantage of these opportunities, to deftrov
the rcafon and justice of the people, and
carjy them into excelTes. It will not suc
ceed in this perfidious project. The peo
ple will expeÂ£t with a patience and te
fignation truly Republican, the result of
the wife meafiues which the constituted
authorities employ to restore abundance â¢
and if they have not all the success which
they have reason to expett, what must.be
<lone? We mull rnfh in a body to the
frontier, seize all the magazines of our
dismayed enemies ! And by this general
movement, retort upon them the utmost
extremes of war and famine ; nourjfh
oqrfelves with their provisions, and thus
turn upon them all those evils, which in
their attrocious calculations they had de
signed for us !
We are far from this direful extremity.
We have no need of an* other fuccorthan
gpod faith one amongst another in so dif
ficult a moment, which added to an almost
usivei lal benevolence will soon pass away.
There *will be no more public calamities if
egotism and avarice, did not so greedily
feiie. upon every embarrafling moment,
whidh occurs to us.

Of Charlotte, the Reviewers have given

unnatural, and it is a talc of real diltrefs.â

The Public are cautioned to
beware of counterfeited Five fiollar Bills of
the Bank of the United States, and Twenty
Dollar Bills of the Bank of North Amfrica,
several of which have appeared in circulation
â¢within a few days past ; they are a good ge
neral imitation of the genuine Bills, but may
be dijlingiii/hed by the following
MARKS.
Five Dollar Bills of the Bank of the
United States.
ALL thai have appeared hav: the letter F.
for their Alphabetical Mark.
The TeAture of the Paper is thicker and
whiter and it takes the ink more freely than
the genuine paper.
The O. in the word Company is smaller
than theM. and other letters of that word,
lo that a line extended from the top of the O,
to touch the tNp of the M. would extend con
fideiably above the range of the whole word.
In the word United the letters are narrow
erand closer together than the reft of the bill
The i and fin the word promise are not
parallel, the f inclining more forward
than the ii
The engraving is badly exectited,the strokes
of all the Letters are stronger and the devite
in the margin particularly is much coarser and
appeal s darker than in the true bills. Some
oi the couuterfeits bear date in 1791âWhere
as the Bank was not in operation tiil Decern
bej-, and no five dollar bills were iflued in
ihat year.
Twenty Dollar Bills of the Bank of North
America.
ALL that hive appeared have the letter
B for their alphabetical mark.
s They are printed on a paper nearly similar
to that of" the couuterfeit Five Dollar Notes
above described j the Engraving ls bettei exe
ucted, and they approach nearer to the ap
pearance of* the genuine bills.
The fine ruled Hnes through the word Twen
ty, in the body of the bill, are in number thir
teen it> the genuine bills, and but twelve in
the counterfeits.
The \Mbrd Company is much like the fame
word in the Five Dollar Bills as defer ibed a
bove, the o being iels than the m, and others
following.
There is no stroke to the t in the word North
whereas in the genuine bills the'ftroke is well
defined.
The letters in the word Twenty, to the
left hand at the bottom, do not come down to
the line, but are Co cut as to give an irregular
appearance to the word, the Tw and 'hey go
ing below them.
The figuarure J. Nixon, has the appear
ance of being written with lamb-black and
o:J, and differs from other inks used in
printing the bills and the cashier's Signature.
It is (uppoled ihefe forgeries were committed
in foinc of" the Southern Slates, as all the coun
terfeits thai have appeared, have come from
thence, and two persons have been apprehend
ed iu Virginia, on suspicion of being the author
of' ihem.
The reward of ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS
will be paid to any Person or Persons who ihall
discover and prolecute to conviction the feveial
offenders of the following defWiptions or any
of them, viz.
The person or persons, who manufa&ured
the paper on which the Bills are printed.
The per<on or persons, who engraved the
plates.
The printer or printers, of the bills.
Every person who has aÂ£ted as a principal in
any other way, in the counterfeiting and utter
ing ihe said biiis.
Philadelphia, March 28, f/94
April 22, 1794,
Other counterfeit bills
of the Bank of the United States have appeared
in circulation.
The denomination is of TWENTY DOL
LARS,and the alphabetical maik is the let
ter B.
They may be diftinguiflied from the gcnu
ihe by the following MARKS :
The pape* r of the counterfeits is of a more
tender texture and glolTey fur face than the
genuine, and tliere is no water mark in them.
Tke letter C. in the word Cashier, in ihe
true bills is strongly marked, whereas in the
counterfeits, ihe whole letter is a line hair
stroke, evidently in an unfinifhed state. The
letter a in the word demand, is badly formed
and the whole word ill done, and there is no
comma at the end of it, as there is in the
genuine bills,
tuth&s3w
The marginal device, is much daiker in
the falfe, than in the genuine bills owing to
tlie (hade (trokes being coarfei, much nearer
together, and consequently much more nu
merous. This difference fti ikes the eye at firft
view.
The fame reward of ONE THOUSAND
DOLLARS, wiJl be paid for apprehending, &
prosecuting to conviction the i'evcral above
described Offenders in iefpe& to this, as to
the last described biV.s.

THEgrand principle of Equalit v, ii' right
ly understood, is the only basis on which
universal justice, (acred order, and perfect
freedom, can be firmly biiilt, and pcnuauciit
ly secured. The View of it exhibited in this
eflay, at the fame time that it rrprellVs the
insolence of office, the tyranny of and
the outrages of uppreflion ; confirms, in the
most forcible manner, the iiecefiity of subor
dination, and the jull demands of law Jul au
thority. So far indeed, from loofenivg the
bands of society, that it iriaintains inviolate,
every natural and every civil diftinfti'on,
draws more clolely every focia! tie, unites in
one harmonious and juftiv proportioned sys
tem, and brings men together on the even
ground of the inhertDt rights of human na
ture, of reciprocal obligation, and of a com
mon relation to the community.
