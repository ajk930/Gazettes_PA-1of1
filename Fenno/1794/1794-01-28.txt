United States, January 2 n't, 1794.
Gentlemen of th " Senate, and of
the House of Representative*,
It Is with fatisfa&ion that I announce
to you, rhat the alterations which have
been made bylaw in the original plan for
raifiijg a duty on spirits d: Hilled willun the
United States, and on il'.lis, co-operating
with better information, have had
iiderabk influence in obviating the difficul
ties, which have embarrassed that branch
of the public revenue. But the obstacles
which have been experienced, though les
sened, are not yet entin-ly
-^uldfecm
added ; which leads me to recall the at
tention of Cpngrefs to the fubjeft. A
mong the matter*, which may demand re
gulation, ia theeffedl, in point of organi
zation, produced by the separation of
Kentucky from the state of Virginia ; and
the fituatipn, with regard to the law of
the territories north-well and south-west of
the Ohio.
The laws refpe&ing light house elta
blilhments require as a condition of their
permanent maintenance, at the exptnee
of the United States, a complete ceP.ion
of foil and jurisdiction. The celTiona of
different Hates loving been qualified with
a refervalion of the right of fervmg legal
process within the ceded jurifdiftion, are
underitood to be icconclulive, as annexing
a qualification not confonar.t with the
terms of the law. I present this circum
stance to the view of Congress, that they
may judge whether any alteration ought
to be made.
As it appeaj-s to be conformable with
the intention of the " ordinance for the
government of the territory of the Uni
ted State 9 north-weit of the river Ohio,"
although it is not expressly dire&ed, th?.t
the laws of that territory (hould be laid
before Congiefs, I now transmit to you a
copy of such, as have been palled from
July to December 1792, incluiive ; being

CONGRESS.

January 16.
In committee of the -whole on Mr. Madifun's
rrfolutions,
Mr. Goodhue,
Mr. Chairman, the propositions now
before us having been confidercd by seve
ral gentleman, who have already fpok.cn,
and who have given such a particular de
tail of calculations, I (hall confine myfelf
to some general obfervatior.s on the fub
jeft.
The gentleman from Maryland, has
made an observation, which (truck me ve
ry forcibly as applied to the subject be
fore us, because it is a maxim to which
all mankind have alfented and upon which
all mankind continually pra&ife, it was
this, " there is no Friendship in Trade,"
and it may be added as a necefl'ary confe
qlience, there ought to be no Hatred in
Track. By following a path founded
upon so obvious a maxim, as the forego
ing, we may be sure of a right guide, but
if we deviate from it, we are in danger of
being led into unforefeen error and mif
chief. It is unqueftionablv our duty to
attend to the Navigation and Commerce
of our country, and give it every proper
encouragement which time ind circum
[lances admit, this has ever been my wilh
and my conduct.
This object so important and desirable
irmft be effected by fixed principles and re
gulations, such as giving our vefiels a de
cided preference in our own ports above
the (hips of every other nation whatever,
by paying less tonnage and other duties ;
by fuffering no foreign (hips to bring into
the United States the productions of any o
| thercountry, than the oneto v.hich they be
long ; and by prohibiting foreign (hips
from coming to the United States from
those places where our own (hips are pro
hibited.
These are the fixed principles and re-
gulajtioivs by one or all of which our na- 1
vigation and commerce can only be pro j
moted, and must never he deviated from,
when adopted in favor of any one nation
whateverâunHs, it be in return forfome
special advantage granted to us by any
particular nation as an equivalent. > l_
therto, onr government has proceeded to
diftiriguifh foreign (hips, only by making
them pay greater tonnage and duties than
our own. Ifcircumttances required it and
the time is judged a seasonable one, I (hall
be willing to proceed further.
Let UÂ» examine what advantages, vve
enjoy in consequence of any commercial
treaties we have already formed lor the
propofitiofls before us, are proposed to at
fea only those nations with whom we
have no treaties, We have commercial
treaties with Prullia, Sweden, France and
Holland, and in the dominions of neither
of those powers, have our (hips or the pro
duce of this country (except in the fi-tgfe
article of our Oil in France) been admit
ted on any more favorable terms than the
(hips or produce of any other nation, and
for this obvious reason because our trea
ties only ensure the advantages they may
grant to the mod favored nation; and being
circumltanced in such a manner as not
judging it for their interest, to diftinguiju
any one by its favorsâwe are left only
in the enjoyment of a trade with them
on the terms common to all other nations
This being the cafe, I would not give
on', farthing to have like treaties formed
with every other nation, for they have
not been and never can be of any fei #ice
to usâif we expect to derive any advan
tage from commercial treaties, we must
stipulate for fomc certain good, for some
other good which we may grant them in
return.
But it 19 said, Mr. Chairman, we are
particularly injured by the commercial re
ftridions of Great Biitainâthe fact is,
we en'oy in our trade with that country,
all the advantages of commerce and in
some instances greater, than they grant to
any other nation. Our pot ash and fcvc
ral other articles pay a less duty in Great
Britain than the like articles do from any
other country, and in no in (lance do I 'oe
lieve they pay greater. Our Ir.ips are al
lowed generally, to carry to Great Bri
tain and Ireland the productions of thi#
country UII the fnme terms their own ships
do. We have also free admiflion into
their extensive territories in India ; where
I they prohibit the (hips of their own coun-
I try, unless they belong to their India com-
party.
It is true our commerce is cramped by
a refufal of our Chi pi into their colonies
of Nova-Scotia, Canada, Newfoundland,
tlicir Well India islands, which ii the ouW
evil of a commercial kind, we have to
complain of in their reputations. But
this is not an evil in consequence of dif
tinguiftiing us from any other nation ; â
they deny that privilege to all others, *nd
it has taken effect as it relates to uÂ» in
consequence of our becoming an indepen
dent nation. The evil of being prohibi
ted their colonies arises from the existing
circumstance* of thingsâtheir contiguity
to the United States, compels them to
carry on a coniiderable trade with uÂ» for
supplies, and in which it is but just we
{hould be partakers, and if we mean to
redress this evil, we (hould point out mem
fures to that object âand fay, no foreign
{hips (hall come to the United States,
from any place, where our Slips are pro
hibited, or, if they do come, they (hould
come under some peculiar disadvantages
âthis would be meeting the evil direct.
If we raise the duties on their manufac
tures imported into this country, as is
proposed by the resolutions now under
consideration, with a view of compelling
them to be more liberal in their commer
cial irrangemcnts with us, we (hall surely
rail* our aimâfor it is certain France in
her present Situation is by no means able
to supply us, whatever (he may do hereaf
ter. No other country, at present, but
Great Britain can supply usâit therefore
follows, undeniably, if such be the fact,
that if we import their goods and lay an
additional duty on them, the blow aimed
at them will fall on us, by raifmg the price
to the consumers in this country eo/ial to
the proposed additional duty.
It is said the chics of the foreign ton
nage that comes to this country, is Bri
ti(h, and this is an evil; if our object is to
promote our own navigation, I (hould
suppose the evil confided in having our
trade so much carried on in foreign bot
toms, and not as belonging to one or ano
ther foreign nation ; and if we meant
further to encourage our ws
ought to raise the tonnage duty on all fo
reign {hipping âthis would be . coming to
the obi'.ft. But how comes it we have so
manv more British (hips than othersâhave
we granted them a monopoly . or may
pot the (hips of every Other nation-come
here on the fame terms they do ?âthe
reason then why there are so many more
liritilh than other foreign (hips which
come here, is not becaufewe have encou
raged it by any regulations we have adopt
ed! but becaule they are a more enter
prising commercial people than their
neighbors, and from other causes which
will ever influence and dircift commerce.
It is also mentioned that aconfiderabk
part of the products of this country (hip
ped to Great-Britain, is not confunled
there, but re-fliipped to other countries,
and that we ought to make fach regula
tions as th-.t such excefa should pass di
rectly to the country where they are con-'
fumed, without their firlt going thro .jh
Grqrt-Britain.
I fhouM think it strange n any One
was to refufis felling an article, becaule he
underilood the peiion who wanted to pur
chase it, would, not be the consumer, hut
lie would afterwards fell it to a.iolhcr
this would not certainly influence, and
ought not. Let us examine and fee whe
ther our navigation ha 3 received any en
couragement by the regulations already
adopted by this government âIn I 790,
our navigation' was but little more than
one half of all the tonnage entered in th_
United States; in 179 1 > was three
fifth#, and in 1792 it was nearly two
| thirds. Foreign tonnage has actually de
creased iince that period I 4,Q09 tons,
while ouis has increaied 171,000 tons.
If the iucreafe is not fufficient, then we
must incrÂ«afe the tonnage duty on foreign
snipping, and take fiich other measures as
I have hinted at t*> promote the object ;
though, I confefsjfuc 1 ! is our delicate situ
ation at this time, I am inclined to believe
exjierhnents are hazardous > and 1 ftioiild
be strongly apprehensive, if we pals any
rcftri&ive l?w? at thi<i time, that (hc-.l afr
feft Great-Britain only, as is the avowed
object of the resolutions before % such is
her close alliance with moll of the Euro
pean nation*, and efpeciaiiy with Spain,
that Ihe will l>e fully able to influence
iome of them at least, and Spain in parti
cular (who is not very friendly) to be as
sociated with her in any count** regulati
on* tin. niay think proper 10 pursue by way
of retaliation.
Mr. Clark differed from many members
who had spoken before him, in the view
they took of the fubjeft ; he conceived,
it ought to be confidcred in a political
light. Wc had many wrongs to complain
of and we should endeavor to obtain re
drefc ; the English have violated our trea
ty, just after it was ratified, by taking
amy our negroes, and since by holding
our pofb ; they have also set the savage*
on our back* and have not they let loose
the Algvr.i.n upon us ? Shall we fit still
and bear it. How can we help it, it is
asked ? They wiil retaliate wc are told.
How retaliate ? will they refufe to fell us
tlieir manufactures ? He remembered that
efenin old times, an non-importation agree
ment made them repeal their damp act.
We have surely as well now as wc had
then a right not to buy their goods; we
dont want to cram our provisions down
their throats or to force them to buy our
lumber. During the non-importation a
greenient, wc did not peri!h with cold ;
we found even then that among ourselves
we could make wherewith to clothe our
selves ; we are surely as able to do it now.
We then gained our point, we should now
be much more powerful with the fame
weapon; many of her manufacturers arc
already llarving for want of emplovment.
We (hould add greatly to their distress,
and soon bring the government to their
senses', and they will be glad to enter into
a commercial treaty with us.
Thc balance of trade with Great-Bri
tain is much egainft us, and by carrying
to Portugal and Spain what we fend to
them we fnould receive cash in return.
France will not always be in a storm, and
a supply of the manufactured articles wa
want may soon be received from tha'. quar-
He did not fee to what purppfe calcu
lations three hours long had been brought
forward. It was very well for merchants
to calculate in their counting houses; but
he conceived the Legislature fhouldxlc
termine the queltion upon political confl
agrations. He concluded.bv remarking,
that he believed bv this time the cornmit
\>tee mail pretty clearly fee that he was in
Tavor of the refutations.
Me. Smith, (M.) rose, especially to
make lome reply to an ohfervation which
5/ad fallen from a member from Pennfylva-
Qia, (Mr. Findley) ydterday. That gen
tleman had remarked, that those merchants
who were not dependent on foreign cre
dit but on their own capital were in favor
of the refutations. He was not furpri
zid, he said, that merehants at f:rit view
ihould approve of them ; he owned, that
a: firlt view he was under that iinprefiion ;
but he was unwilling to make up his mind
before a mature inveltjgation of the fub
jecl, and he believed, that those very mer
chants would be of his opinion did they
take the pains he had taken to be well
informed. The last refohittorl in partic'fl-
I:ir, he remarked, is well calculated to bi
as those who had furfered from piratical
'â whations, he had felt an impreflion from
it, for he was liable like other men to be
warped by wtereft, he imagined; he had
faltered fevercly from those depredations,
tho' the gentleman from Pennfylvanja
seemed to iiifiijnate, (and he found that
what he had said was so understood out
of doors) that he was one of those mer
chants who traded upon British credit;
yet, he had loft as much by those spolia
tions as that gentleman would think a
hardfome fortune for his foil.
Mr. l'indley assured the gentleman that
his observation was a general one and that
he had no eye to what might be his mer
cantile si tuition.
Mr. Smith (Hid, thit knowing the cap
('.id not fit him he fhotild not have taken
): up if he hsd not heard whifper6 of its
being intended for him. There was how
ever a time when it would have fitted him.
He facrificed his fortune in the service of
his countrv, when (trugling for indepen
dence ; when that boon was obtained, his
industry and commercial entciprize alone
remained ; these assisted by that credit so
much deprecated enabled him to make an
other, and to be in a Otuation again to
fcrve his country. The character of mer
chants is generally not properly apprecia
ted, they are conlidered as intfcrefted and
narrow minded. These are not the cha
racterise features of the American mer
chant at least. He pa.Ted a handsome en
comium on their general information, and
enterpriztt.
He was not fnrprized, he said, to hear
that Come merchants (hould advocate the
refutations; if thry affected the credit we
are able to obtain in Great-Britain, the
merchant of great capital only could trade,
a complcat commercial aristocracy would
be eflabliihed. Young men with small
capitals, would not be able to embark in
trade, the wealthy trader would engross
the whole, and instead of i o*per cent now
received, 25 would be extorted. It is no
hardlhip to the young trader to make use
of Britilh capital paying an interest of 5
per cent when he co>:ld borrow the mo
ney uo where else, and must remain idle
without it.
He concluded by a few general obfer
vat'ons on the balance of trade and the
propriety of permitting commerce to find
its ow:i level. To he continued.

We are told that the following melan

bad in his possession, in Medford, was sud

his head and face torn in so (hocking a

of the animal was so great, that
5 persons could hardly disengage its teeth
and claws from the unhappy viÂ£lim of its

from anarchy to good government fotind-

" The violent shock between a mass of
errors ufeful to t <e free, and powerful,

tals. In the fhidy ofhiftory, whole prin

from tyranny to liberty, its natuial con
fequenee, one generation facriiiced to the
happiness of the But when this

Extract of a letter from London, to an
Anglo-American merchant in this city.
London, Sept. 30, 1793
" Your excellent letter, containing a
very pleasing account of your reception in
America, together with your general ob
servations on the noble simplicity of repub
lican manner#, and the beantiea of the
country, raised in my mind a fÂ«t of feeling*
more ardent and more fublirne than I had
fdt for some timeâfor you well know the
miserable din and clang of politic* witich
constantly assault our ear*, and crucirjr.our
feelings hereâour bell face* grin but a
ghallly smile, compared with ytwra.
" I observe your mind, (so accuftoru
ed to political invcftigation) feel* a ge
nerous expanse in that clime which it con
genial to your nature. I cannot consider
you as an Exotic in America, you are a
Native tif that pure air of freedom which
they breathe. Your intervie-r with the
President George Washington, must have
afforded you the most exalted pleasureâl
recognized in the true features that il
lustrious man, whose character throws in
to (hade most of the splendid names in the
world, and I formed a wi(h to enjoy the
fame gratification at feme future period.
" 1 think I the noble simplicity
of your p\il>lic assemblies in that rational
and dignified method of business you fa
well describe : disdaining the Imposture
and Artifice of some European govern
ments, they never feel what is called the
State Neceflity of pra&ifing them. One
of the peculiar excellencies of your govern
ment is, that it affords few temptations
to alienate the Governors from their duty,
and few means of rendering corruption pa
latable to the Governed. In the piefent
imperfect (late of man, we must produce
virtue by destroying the alluiementi of
vice. I apply this remark to our political
fy Itemsâremember the infamy of Electi
on Jobs in a country you once knewâ.iot
only the Elected but the Ele&ors become
corrupt: they like the poison that cor
rodes their own vitals ; there iÂ»aÂ£tion and
reaction of vice between government and
the people, which produces a Body of In
iquity that pollutes the whole land. The
excellence of your constitutions will, I
doubt not, produce oppofitc effedisâthe
opportunity of debasing each other v.'ill
ftldom
" 1 am far from supposing that in an
Improved state of Society such compara
tively low motives to public virtue will be
necefiary. The relative duties of society
I trust will be so well understood, the 1-
dea: of general justice so strong in the hu
man character, and the divine principle of
doing to others as we wish they (hould do
unto us, be so operative that the practice
of it will be uuiverfal. At present we are
only Children in practical Knowlidge, and
Babes in the Practice of it. The great
principle, that the Only end of good go
vcrr.ment is the Happiness of the Govern
ed, will, like the lea of eternal truth, e
ventually swallow up the llreams of error
and corruption, and produce a sum total
of human felicity not yet to be calculated.
" You taste at present a happy Earnest
of this felicity in America, and I know
of no country more likely to realize thdfe
enjoyments. The providence of God,
soon after its dlfcovery, pointed it out as
an afylnm for those brave and profeciited
Worthies, of whom Europe was not wor
thyâagain you are a witness and a par
taker of the fame benefits Communicated
by that happy country. All Hail !
America, bicfied are thy friendly (bores
-bat welcome the opprefiTtd Sons of Free

and preserved one diftinguiflied Patriot
through' that arduous contest to conduct
her to the joys of peace and good govern
ment ! We mayjuftly anticipate the prof
pecft of feeing thy exteniive climes explore',
and peopled by unnumbered millions, all
under the dominion of that Prince, whose
gospel speaks peace on earth and good
will towards men !
" Aridocracies and Heirarcbies alrea
dy (land aguail to hear that your country
affords such benefit* to man without Their
benign influence. To hear the wild and
arrogant boasts of fouic refpettiug their
particular conftitutioni ; you would think
that nature would not yield her accuilom
ed bounties but where They exist ; and
yet 1 understand Ycur rivers flow, and the
earth holds not D ick her increase.
" I congratulate your country on the
acccflion of learning and talents which it
will receive by the arrival of Mr. Cooper,
late of Maacliefter: He has failed, and I
suppose will soon be with you ; and I be
lieve I)r. Priestley is fully determined to
cross the Atlantic in the spring.âWhat
a number of wife and virtuous citizens will
America receive from the late perfecti
ons ! They will doubtlefsadd much to its
wealth and prosperity. I fay to you, not
with the authority, but with the langtiage
of an apoftlr, Salute the Brethren..

An Extract.
IT lias been remarked, and probably
with a degree of truth, that some of the
people who have but lately made their es
cape from the bondage of the Old Coun
tries and Governments of Europe, to this
land of liberty, arc more difpolcd to lieen
tioufnefs, while they {hew a greater desire
to dictate to the Americans about the af
fair* of government,than perhaptany other
set of m*n in the United States. Admit
ing thit is the cafe, a corrtfpor.dent wishes
to know, from whertce arises such incon
sistency ? and if, at the fame time, thit it
i* an evidence of their vanity, it does not
â¢lfo prove that their minds, their manners,
an<l habits, at yet partake of the govern
ment under which they weri formed ; and
that liberty under a Republic, is a happi
ness which such men are not immediately
capable of enjoying, even fuppofmg them
to be worthy of itâwhether they are not
apt to play the tyrant in their manner and
cotiverfation, while their ckmoui s refpeft

MR. FF.nno,
THE extract of a letter from London,

tilh agent or partisan, with a design to
deceive members of Congiefs, and mificad
the public mind on the fubjeft of Mr.
Madison's propositions, now depending
before the Houfc of Representatives ; in
proof of this, it is only necefiary to remark,
00 the circumilance of the supposed letter
wi iter's knowledge of Mr.Pinckncy's (the
American Miniiler) remonflrance to the

TION OF BRISSOT.
AHd the other arretted Deputies.
The following are tlie chargcs against Brif
fot and liis accomplices, contained in the
of Accusation presented to the ' atioiial Con
vention by A mar, in the nam.- of the Commit
nee of General Safety :
' Briltot, Agent to the Ponce under Kings,
diforaccd on account ot his bale intrigues un
tier the ancient government <>r Vigi'Mce of the
Commons of Paris, in the beginning o! the
Revolution, through the cred't of La Fayette,
has for i Song time past prostituted h,s pun and
his public duty in favour of that General wh..fe
lcfignatioO he reprel'ented as a public calamity,
and has at all times fliswn himfelf an enemy
to the popular Societies.
He went to the Jocobins to prepare the ruin
of the Colonies, to bring forward the day ot
the Chamn de Mars, where the be a patriots
mere affaflinated by older of l-a Fayette, and
*, r>r--ach up war with a view to dsOroy the
tiu 't infant liberty of the nation.
At the 1 egiflative ffemhly he coalesced
with Condorcet and thÂ» Girondirts, who only
contrived to gain the favour of the People on
occasions of fmsll importance, with a view to
â¢ abandon them on great ones.
The Court made use of their influence to
f ] lare war at a mwment when the armies and
th,â  fortified places were in a state of abfolate
want, or entvulleil to traitor* choftn by a per
il,re.' Kill.?. 'rhev piotefled NÂ»r onne, the
Mintfler, whom ail France acctifed of the mea-
Cures tak-n to render this war fatal to liberty ;
and in their Journals they calumniated the Pa
rrots who had thtf coma-re to refi't them.
Thev defended DiettiiVh, convicted] of be- <
in,r an accomplice with I a Fayette, and of ha
vine offered to give up Straifcourg ; and while
th ' CbVrfs of that faction protected the con
foira'ors and traitorous Generals, the patriotic
soldiers were profcrihed, and the volunteers of
Par's frnt to he butchered.

Carra wa* in league with certain ckara&era ot
the Court of Berlin. In hiÂ® Journal Poiique
of the 25th of Augult, 1791, he formed a v ifh,
on account of the marriage of the l)uiic of York
with the Princess of Prutlia, " that the Duke

Brunfwick was preparing to decide the fate of
the Trench nation by the force of arms, Carra

cÂ«mn>nnder, the g'eatefl politician, the mofk
; amiable Prime in Europe, formed to be the rc

go to ihe jacobins & put on thf red cap, in or
der to toflrefl tlx- pdÂ»pie i'l favour ot this f-tcl
lite of tyrants. Finally, Carra was so audacious
as to pro pole openly to the jaCobius, for the.
Dulce of Yoi k to he King of the French.
From these and many other fa&s too'tedious
to mention, there refoits, that (arra and his
aflociates were iniquitous and deep difleniblers,
pensioned bv Kngiand, Pruflia, and Holland, to
Enable a Prince of that family wnich rules over
theft countries, to obtain the crown of France.
This lame Carra, together with Si lery-, the
diihotiortfd confident of a contemptible Prince,
was sent by the then reigning fa&ian to Du
mourier. to compleat that fre&ifen which saved
the almost ruined army of the Prufiian delpot.

I But these perfidious Ministers, having been
J threatened by one of their colleagues to be der-
I nounred to the people, it was then that Carra
and Sillrry were sent to Dumourier, to autfco
rife this General to negociate with Frederick
William to enable this I'rincc to get out of the
kingdom, orv condition that he Ihould leave the
Netherlands without the fufficien? means of de
f.nce, and delivered them up to the numerous
and triumphant armies of FTance.
1 he calumnious harrangues that were made
in the tribunes, were prepared, or fanCtior.ed at
Rohiid's, or in the niCciiiigs ihat were held at
Valaze's and Pecion's. I l|"ey proposed to mr
render the Convention with a Pretorian guard,
under the name of Departmental Force, which
was to be the balls of their foederal system. In
the 1 .egiflative Aliembly they mentioned a
flight beyond the Loire, with the Aflemb y, the
Executive Council, the Royal Family, and the
public treafur?. Kerfaiut, at his return from
Sedan, dnred to propose this projeA to the Ex

the tyrant by impeding the dif utiion. They
appointed acommiflion of twenty f< ur members

These declamations milled the department, and
induced tliem to form a coalition, which was
near being fatal to lrance.
I hey patronized an incivic piece, entitled,
L'ami des l.ois.
On the 14th of January, Barbarous and his
friends had given orders to the battalion ot
Marfeillois, to iurround the Convention.
On the aoth, Viladi wrote to the other De
puties- To-morrow in arms to the Convents
ou-* he is a coward who does not appear there.
Brillot, tfrer the condemnation of l.ouis C a
pet, censured the Convention, and threatened
France with the vengeance of European kings.
When it was his object to bring or. war, lie
fj'ukc in an opposite sense, and treated the
dov nfall of all thronts, and the conquest of the
universe, as the (port of the French nation. Be.
ing the "rgan of the Diplomatic committee,
campofed aTniotl entirely of the fame facSion, he
proposed war suddenly agaiuft England, Hol
land, and all the powers that had not then de
clared themselves.
This fi&ion a<Â£ted in coalition with perfidious
Generals, particularly with Dumouricr, Gen
fonnet held a daily correspondence with him :
Peticn was his friend. He avowed hinifelf the
Counsellor of the Orleans party, and had con
nexion with Sillery and his wife.
After the revolt of Dumouricr, Vergniaud,
Gaudet, Brifl'ot and Genfonne, wiflied to jufti
fy his conduct to the committee ol General De
fence. afl'erting that the denunciations made
againll him by the Jacobins and the Mountain
were the caÃie of his conduit; and that Du
mourier was the prote&or of the found part ef
the Convention.-.'! his was the party of which
Petion, Brillot, Vergniaud, &c. were the
chief and orators.
When Dumourier wis declared a traitor by
the Convention, Briffot, in th- Patriote Fran
coife, as well as other writers, who were hi 9
accomplices, praised him, in defiance of the
law. As members of the committee of Gene
ral Defence, they ought to have given infor
mation relative to the preparations tkat were
nuking in I.a Vendee. The Convention, how
ever, was not made acquainted with them till
the war became htii.us.
They armed the Sections where arifiocracy
reigned, agiinlt thoie where public spirit was
triumphant.

manner, iniprifoned the Magi I'rates of the

Cf, when lie used this atrocious expreflion :
" The aftonilhed traveller will leek on what
banks of the Seine Paris once flood. " The
1 onvemion dilfo'.ved the commifiion, which
however, returned its fur.&ions ou its own au
thority. and continued to ail.
The Mion, by the addrefles which it sent
to the departments armed them againtl Pans
and the Ctlftytintfoii, '1 he death of nunioers
of Patriots ill the fouthem Departments, and
particularly at Marseilles, where they per'ftied

ter..revolution in the sooth. Ihe Republican
Municipality was dispersed by the rebelt,'and
good citizeiis were miflacred. Every pur.ilh
ment that cruelty couid devise to cncreale the
torments of death was put in execution. The
jdmiiiiilrjiive bodies were leagued partly with
I.yons, and partly with foreign ariilocrats, and
with the emigrants dispersed through the
Swiss Canton^.
The Cabii.et of I.ondon afforded life ai'l
energy tcr this rebellious league. Its pretext,
was the anarchy thai reigned at Paris ; its lea

Carra and Dochael were sent to this Depart
ment in quality of deputies from the National
Convention.
Carra publicly exhorted the a-lminiftrators
ol the Maine and Loire to fend troops against
Paris. Both these deputies were at the fame
time conncdtcd with the generals of the com
bined armies.
Couftard sent alio as a commiffionor, carried
his treafon&bh: projefls to iuch a length, as e
ven to furnilh supplies of provilionÂ» and (lores

was marked by tiiniUr traitoreus measures.

Wimp fen, degraded by his attackmeiit to ty
