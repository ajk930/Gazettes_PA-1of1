" Victory belongs to courage, it is
yomsj strike exterminate the fatelites

Strike, let none efeape your just ven

A deputation from the popular Soci

their sorrow for the removal of General

Letter from Dubois CraÃce, and Gau"
thicr, Representatives of the People
with the army of the Alps.
Lyons, October 9.
" The army of the republic this day
entered into Lyons without any oiforder,
and crowned its glory by acts of humani
tv. No person had reafoa to complain
of an injury ; and, notwithttanding their
fatigue and their necessities, the soldiers
stared their bread with the unfortunate
victims of aristocracy. The rebels escaped,
as 1 forefaw, on the mod favourable
quarter, by Vaizes, to the number of
about four thousand men, with the artil
lery and the caiflons richly loaded. They
were surrounded ; our troops puifued
them, and killed Ijoo; 60 or 80 were
taken prisoners, among whom was the
Marquis de Virien, Ex Constituent .â¢
their artillery was also taken, of which
one caiflon was filled with gold. The
remainder of the rebels escaped, but they
are pursued and not one will reach the
frontiers. We are informed that the
Convention icealls us; we hasten to
obey. Our conduct is to undergo an
examination ; this we solicit as a favour ;
â¢it will prove that we have never deviated
from the principles of good republicans,
and that we have never capitulated with
ibe rebels."
Duboii-Crance dates in hit dispatch,
â¬><wttr of (VBiiitrt J^faleg
that he knew the quarter most favourable
for the retreat of the rebels. Why then
said the Secretary, who read it, did he
march the troops to a different quarter. I
demand that the letter be referred to the
committee of public fafety.âAdopted.
Letter from General Verdelin, comman"
aer of the troops in the territory of
Fauchigny, dated from Salanches, Oc-
tober.
"Having re.ceived information that the
enemy were fortifying themselves at tile
bridge of St. Martin, and had already
surrounded the post of Mirebelle with en.
tienchments, 1 immediately marched in
three columns; after an obstinate engage
ment the enemy is disconcerted, and dri
ven from their entreuchmets, were com
pletely routed, and being unable to rally
tliey retreated in the greatest disorder by
tl>e pass of Bonhomme, leaving behind
them a great number of their men, who
had gone astray in the mountains.
" Our loss has been very trifling ; a
mong the killed there is one officer. The
loss of the enemy has been very conside
rable. All (he heights of Mirebelle are
Itained with their blood and strewed with
their dead. We have made two officers
and fifty Piedmontefe, regulars, prison
ers of war.exclusive of a great number of
Rebels, who having been taken in arms,
were ftiot according to law. The regu
lars were received with fraternity, by the
soldiers of the Republic. One three
pounder, three other guns of smaller ca
libre, several tumbrels and 2Q,000 car
tridges have fallen into our hands. We
have this inliant discovered, after a care
ful search, the four pieces of cannon that
the enemy had buried near Notre Dame
de la Glofge, and which the quickness
of the pursuit did not leave them at liber
ty to carry off with them by the pass of
Bonhomme."

" I refervedthiscity as a bonnebouche.
I relied upon finding patriotism in Pe
ronne, but what was my astonish
ment to find here a new Coblentz. The
Marquis of Robecourt was mayor. The
city was under the influence of that Mar
quis. The other magistrates were no
better. I aflembled the people, nobody
offered to denounce the difaffefted. The
mufcadins alone raised their voice. I de
clared with the poignard in one hand &
the torch in the other, that I was going
to proclaim the city in a Hate of rebel
lion. I aflembled the people a second
time ; in order to (Irike the blow I had
the patriots around me, but iu a small
number. I repaired to the municipality,
where they denounced to me the trai
tors ; the people cried, Vive la Repub
liqiie, Vive la Montagne. The traitors
are arretted. The Marquis de Robe
court, and all those who resembled him,
are removed. 1 have nominated good
Sans-Culottesin their ttead.
" An aid-de-camp, aged eighteen,
has been lurprifed writing to the emi

1 lie Member) composing the com
mission of monuments, wrote from St.
Dennis, that if the tombs of the Kings
had not yet disappeared in the church of
St. Dennis, it was on account of the
necessity for saving the public finances;
that they thought proper to make out an
eflimate of the mod indispensable expen
ces for preserving the works of art which
these tombs contain; that all the tools
had arrived at St. Denis, and that to
morrow the hammsr would destroy the
remains of royalty.
Deputies from the twenty-eight fec

A letter from the commissioners with
the artny on the coast of Rochellej in
formed the convention, that the armies
of Niort and Saumur had had a most
bloody battle with the repels, who had
been completely routed on the 9th. Their
force, amounted to about io.doo men,
had been difpei fed over an extent of coun
try of more than 30 miles. A party of
Wefiermahn's detachment had entered
Charillon, and liberated tbo prisoners.
The opposition of the rebels, the Com
miliioners affirm, was at an end. In the
battle several Republicans were killed, a

The committee of Public Safety pre
sented a short report, which contained
only these wordsâ* 1 Thirty millions arc
necelfary for a secret and mod important

The National Convention, without a
ny debate, parted a decree, ordering the
sura required to be delivered to the com
mittee.
LevafFeur, commissioner at Beauvats,
announced, that tranquillity was rcftortd
there.
Barrere read a letter from General
Dagobert, who informed the conven
tion, that the army under his command
had entered Spain* and taken the town
of Campredon.âDuring the period
granted to the Alcalde Major of the city
to reply to the filmmons to surrender, the
Spanish troops fired upon the meflenger
who carried the summons, and contin
ued also their fire upon the troops of the
republic.âlt was therefore resolved to
storm the city, which was effcÂ£ed with
success. The inhabitants fled with pre
cipitation, and were pursued to a great
distance. It was not possible to lay the
city under contribution, for the houses
were entirely destitute of inhabitants.
The commissioners of the Convention
wrote from Bagnols, dated O&ober Bih,
that the vi6tory of Argelles had pro
duced an immense booty. The garrison
of Callihoure it encamped on the heights.
The Spaniards sent the flower of their
cavalry to attack them, but in vain.
They loft 300 men, and 15 taken prifoi*-
ers, of.whom two are colonels.âThe
French had 60 men killed or wounded.
They found at St. Genies an bofpital for
800 sick. The SpaniHi at my is in the

temptinga retreat.
Prifux and Hentz, being returned
from La Vendee, repoited that the mea
fures taken by the committee of public
fafety were the only ones proper to be a
dopted. General L/Echelle was arrived,
and had taken upon him his command â
The fame commiflioners a flu red the Con

Romme, in commifiion with David,
forcollefting all the articles that may be
ufeful to the arts and to public iutlruc
tion, announced that they had discove
red, in a private house, 42 volumes of the
correspondence of marshall de Bclleifle,
containing valuable details on the ma
rine and the art of war ; from theft it
will appear, said Romme, that the Mar

RIOTS AT BIRMINGHAM.
BIRMINGHAM, October 2
It being within one week of the tirfie
when the present Constables go out of
office, and there remaining between fix and
leven hundred pounds uncolleÂ£ied of the
firft payment towards the damage done h<f
the rioters in July 1791, on Monday af
ternoon, Mr. Barrs, one of the Conftablesj
went, with proper afliftanCe, to distrain,
at the house of one Wood, in Litchficld
ftreet. Wood refufed to pay the sum he
had been afTefTed, and behaved very impro
perly ; a considerable concourse of people
instantly appeared at the door, and became
so disorderly, that the officers Were obliged
to delict ind retire.
Before fix o'clock many hundreds wertf
afTembled, palled through many of the
principal streets, and became so turbulent
that the (hops in the High-street were all
(hut up; from thence they proceeded to
the New Churcb Yard, where, counte
nanced by a number of idle fpeftators,
they prcfently demolifiied the windows of
Mr. Barrs the Conltablc.
. The magistrates appeared and read tlie
riot-a<3, and a party of the d regiment
of dragoons were ordered oiit from the
barracks, and directed to disperse the mul
titude; they l'nftantly rulhed amonfft them
with their drawn swords, wounded five or
fix, took twenty-four into custody, aiid
fafely lodged them in the dungeon.
The riot-aft was read three times in the
course of the evening, and the troops pa
raded the streets all night.
Encouraged again by the idle and the
curieus, to whose presence all the mifchief
of a riot is generally owing, early vefterday
morning, the rabble threatened to refirtfe'
those in the dungeon, but had not then
the hardiness to attack a military guard.
At nine o'clock in the morning tbe ri-'
ot ast was read at the Welch Croft ; and
about one in the afternoon, the prifoncs
escorted by a party of horse, were bro't
before the magistrates, when ten weft d'.[-
charged, and fourteen remained for fur
ther examination. A military guard con
tinued on duty in the streets during the
whole of yesterday, and in the evening a
nother party of the fame regiment arriv
ed in town from Wolverhampton.
After a very turbulent day, in which
crowdi of people were continually fraver
fing the streets, and all business in a great
measure iufpended, at ten o'clock iaft night
an attack was made on the dungeon, to
refcoe tbe prisoners, when the goaler found
it neceflary twice to dilcharge a blunder
buss, by which three were wounded, ami
the crowd mllantly dispersed. T*vo of the
wounded were taken to the hospital, or.f
of whom is said to be in so dtfperate a
state, that is either dead of dving
the recovery of the other is vety uacer
tain.
One of tbe men wounded on Mnru'nv
night, had yesterday a piece of l>is fiuill
removed, which was fraffcurrd hy a ftrojtc
with a sword.
Half past one o'clock in the afternoon.
âAll is now tranquil; afiother party of
soldiers are coming from Kiderrm'nher,
and 12 or 14 of the prisoners are lull ta
teu before the Magilliaies.C.ONGRESS

The following written messages were

United Stales, Jtnuary 7, 1793
Gentlemen of the Senate, and
of the Hot.fe of Rrprefentanves,
Experience has (hewn that it would be
ufeful to have an officcr particularly churg
ed, under the dire&ion ff the Depart
ment of War,with the duties of receiving,
fofe-keeping, and distributing the public
fiipplits, in all cases in which the laws and
the course of service do not devolve them
upon other officers; and also with that of
fuperinteneing in all cases the iflues in de
tail of supplies, with power, for that pur
pose, to bring to account all persons en
trulted to make such ilfues, in relation
thereto.
An cftablifhmcnt of this nature, by se
c uting a regular and pur&ual accountabi
lity for the ifiues of public supplies, would
be a grtat guard against abuse, would
tend to ensure their due application, and
to give public fatisfaftiou on that point.
1 therefore recommend to the confider
ption of Congress, the expediency of an

repxlatioos as (hall appear to them advife

Ifolj'e of ReprefcntJt'wa
Monday, Jan. 13.
A report was received from the Secre-
tary of 'the Treasury, containing a ftate
inent of the actual ton-age employed be-
tweei) the United States and foreign coun-
tries, for one year ending Sept. 30, '793
Mr. Shei bourne called up the petition
of Thomas Manning, prefentcd lait week
âhe observed that the fotts set forth ia
the petition were ellablilhed by documents
which accompanied it. That the petiti-
on originated in a contract made by the
petitioner with an agent of the French go
vernment in Martinique ; that altho' that
government had recognized the powers of
their agent, and the performance of the
services which were the groundof the con
trail, they had refufed to fulfill it, but by
a payment of affignats, instead of specie,
which had been particularly fpecified.â
He obferred, had the contrail been made
with an individual, a process in a judicial
court would have procured an indemnity,
but it was with a nation, over which ju
dicial courts had no controul ; the petiti-
oner therefore could derive no redress
but from tile juflice of his country, which
was bound to protect the rights of its ci
tizens in ail cases, and when it could not
prevent an injury, it ought to repair the
damage. That this in the present cafe,
might be done with a moral afturance of a
rcimburfement, as it would be a just arti
cle of charge in the account of the Uni
ted States against France, to which jus
tice mull chearfully give its fan&ion, and
which in happier times, that government
will undoubtedly allow. That as the jus
tice of the demand was confelfed, indem
nifying the petitioner would be advancing
a payment for France, for which her cre
dit and honor were pledged, but which the
present situation of that country would
not at present allow her to make ; but, Mr
Sherboume observed, that as the cafe was
of the firft impression, and he wiihfd there
be a thorough investigation of prin
ciples as well as facts. He moved that
the petition with the documents accom
panying it, might be referred to the Se
cretary of StateâThis motion obtained.
The report on the petition of Henry
Hill, in behalf of himfelf and others, was
read and taken into consideration, and af
ter fomc debate wa3 laid on the table.
The house then, agreeably to the or
der of the dav, went into committee of
the whole, Mr. Trumbull in the chair, on
the report of the Secretary of State, re
lative to the situation of our commercial
1 elations with foreign countries.
The refplutions proposed by Mr. Madi
son fume days since, founded on this re
port, were read by the clerk.
Mr. Smith S. C. rose. He hopedthat
it would be in order to take into view the
general scope and cenor of the \vholÂ« body
of resolutions before the committee.
Amongst the variops duties of the iegi
ilature under the constitution, none ap
peared to him more important than those
which had for object the regulation cf
commerce, as they must involve thÂ» consi
deration of a great variety of interells.
These interells open a copious field for
discussion, as they affe& the agriculture,
navigation and manufactures of this coun
tryâthis being considered, the committee
he hoped would, viewing the importance
of the fubjeft in the fame light he saw it,
excuse him if he took much of their time
in adverting to a variety of fadts connec
ted with it.
As the committee were on the report of
the Secretary of State on a commercial
fubjeÂ£t he ihould not go into political con
siderations which might by some be consi
dered as in a degree connected ; he hoped
other members would lee the propriety of
pursuing the feme plan. It would argue
a diltrult of the strength of the ground on
which the resolutions proposed, Hand, if
the advocates forthofe resolutions permit
ted themselves to recur to politics to sup
port them. He imagined it would be
right to dismiss the consideration of all
questions' relative to Indian?, Algerines
and Western pcfts at the present time.â
There will be a time, and perhaps not far
distant, when these questions will coir.e
under consideration, when this happened,
he said, he fhodd be prepared to give his
opinion, with firmnefs and according to
what he conceived the true interefti of the
country : but these fubiefls he conceived,
not properly connected with the prelent,
which gives of itfelf fufficient scope for
argument, he (hould not therefore mix
The present is a delicate crisis; this coun
try, since the'fcvoliition has probably never
been in Â«b critical a situation : the fubjefl
ought then to be weighed with calm reflec
tion and deliberation, passions should not
'be fubllituted for reason, and the decision
oughtnot to be founded on narrow or pre-
jud'eed views.
Tlie report of the Secretaey of State
is before the committee, it gives a compa-
rative view of our commercial regulations
with other countries and invites us to reta-
liatiou. The moll striking contrail there en
deavoured to be established is between the
fyllepis of France and Great Britain ; he
(hould proceed he said, to lay before the
committee an accurate statement of cer-
tain facts with which that reportbeing com-
pared it would be seen whether there is
lolid ground for the inferences endeavour-
Ed to be eftablilhedin it.
To view the fubjeft clearly it will be ne
ceflary to advert to the situation of affairs
before the revolution of France, the coin-
mercial regulations of that country since
that period having been produced by mo
mentary intereils, Tome of which are not
to be mistaken, are not therefore such facts
as the legislature (hould proceed upon.
He produced a table, made he said, by
a gentleman of commercial knowledge,
comprehending a comparative view of our
commerce with Great Britain and France
before the French revolution. With a view
to conciseness the scope of this table has
been confined to those articles which are of
consequence in our trade. We are accus
tomed to hear continually the generosity
and liberality of the French towards us
greatly extolled, and the conduct of Great
Britain as severely reprobated; it might
therefore be expected that this table
would contain instances of advantages al-
lowed on the one hand and reftrirtions
laid on the other; but the reverse of this
expectation, he said, will be realized. It
will be found that in France and the
French Weft-Indies, we are not more fa
voured in refpeft to our exporis than in
the British dominions except in the not
very important article of fifh oil; this Mr.
Smith, requested the committee particu
larly to notice; and that Great Britain and
her islands hold out to us leveral advanta-
ges, in refpett to our exports, not enjoyed
by other nations, that are of very great im
portance. Mr. Smith (S. C.) was pro
ceeding to read the table when Mr. Ma
dison rose to aflc what period it relates
lo.j Mr. Smith informed him that it was
built upon the state of things before the
French revolution.
Mr. Smith then read hi 6 table, through
which it will be fuflicient to follow him,
when he commented on it. Having men
tioned the authentic documents, on which
it is founded, such as proclamations of the
King of Great Britain and statutes of
their Parliament on the one hand, and ar
rets of the French Government on the
other, he proceeded to make some obfer
\ations on the principal exports from this
country.
FLOUR the article of firft importance
among our exports, is more farorcd by
Great Britain than France. France laid
a duty of one-eighth per cent, on it, and
no more on that imported from other na
tions. Great Britain lays a duty of 24/3
per quarter, until British flour rises to 50/",
when ours pays a duty not above 6i.â
The fame system as to grain prevails ge
nerally in Great-Britain. Both these
countries are good flour markets only in
times of fcarcrtv, when, the British mar
kets are high and the duties low and the
French not able to supply enough for
their own consumption, for when they are,
our flour will not pay freight and chatrges,
this will appear by attending to the price
of that commodity. The average price
in France, in abundant ye:rs, is 5 dollars
and 2-3 per bar. of Penn. It ought to
be fix and a third in France to bear expor
tation from Pennsylvania.,
France will generally produce enough
for her own consumption, wljile Great Bri
tain, it appears by a report of a commit
tee of the privy council is likely to be
incompetent to her own l'upply, which
may render her market Ik real's er better
1 for that article. '
France lays no duties of any confe
rence on our flour, because they have no
fear of our importations rivalling the sale
of their own.
In the Weft Indies, matters wear a dif
ferenta fpett. France prohibited the im
portation of onv flour there by apetmanent
law. To be sure the colonial governments
had the power to enaa temporary fufpen-
Aoiii of this law, bat thefc were oa!y ex-
ceptionsto the general rule and are not to
bo. calculated upon. He believed the Se
cretary of State mistaken in his aflertion,
that latterly the prohibition had been ta
ken off, unless he applies his observation
to a period subsequent to that to which
his report extends. There was, he wsb
told, an arret in 1789 directing a suspension
for some parts of the islands but it was
soon after repealed, in France, as he has
been informed.
In the Britifli islands this article stands
upon quite a different footing. Our flour
may be imported free of all duties, and
other foreign flour cannot be imported
there, even in Britifli bottoms.
He proceeded to give a view of the
operations of these different lyitems 111
1786, and 1788.
In '86 we exported to France 21 bar
rels only ;to her colonies 1808. In the
fame year, to Great Britain none ; but to
her colonies 45,1 18 barrels.
[11 '88, to Fiance, 2375 ; her colonies,
235. 111 the fame year to Great Brirain,
828, to her islands, 59,938.
Here then is a prodigious difference in
favor of the system of Great Britain, in
the article of flour. It is true that in
1791, '92 and '93, there were very large
exportations of this article to France and
her islands ; but as this was the effect of
the convulsed situation of that country,
it is no criterion to build upon. The Se
cretary of State is of thii opinion ; he
does not think it right to found calcula
tions upon any other than the former fet
tled state of things.

" We have the pleasure to fay, we do
not find the Algerines have captured a
single American, numbers having arrived
here, at Oporto, Cadiz, Bilboa, &c. and
it is with infinite pleasure we acquaint you,
that the truce in question was mere the
result of an unexpected event, than any
studied plan of this cabinet, who, so far
from approving of the consequences, have
taken measures to protest your trade, and
have actually dispatched a frigate to their
squadron in the bay of Gibraltar, with or
ders to examine at sea every prize, and all
that (hall be found bound to the ports of this
kingdom are to be set free, and the Alge
rines not to molcft any of them in future
at sea; and this government has appointed
a convoy to protest the fifteen American
{hips now here, to a certain latitude,
whencc they will proceed home free from
the Algeriiies. So that the apprehen
sions we were under, in the firft instance,
are now nearly removed, as there is little

BRUSSELS, October 22.
The great and bloody battle which
tiould have crowned all the former vidto
rics of the campaign, and from which we
expe&ed such brilliant fiiccefs, was fought
on the 15th and 16th init. unfortunately
to the disadvantage of the combined ar
mies.
You will have seen what the government
h?8 thought fit to tell the public, in the'
official bulletins. But the fatts you may
be aflured, are such as I have stated.
The loss of our army is 5000 men kil
led and wounded, among whom are 115
officers. The prince of Anhalt-Kauthen,
who commanded the dragoons of Cobourg,
on the left, was struck down by a {hot,
and it is not known whether he fell dead
or alive into the hands of the enemy.
It is now certain that the defeat of the
left wing of prince Cobourg's army, com
manded by Tertzi, and Hohenloe, was
the principal cause of the loss of the battle,
which obliged the generals to retreat in
the night, to avoid being precipitated into
the Sambre.âThe retreat was effected in
good order, and the army, is now encamp
ed along the other fide of theViver, partly
under cover of the' furtreffes of-Quefnoy,
and Valenciennes.
The regiments of Brechianville, Stein,
Knunitz infantry, ICavanaugh, Cobourg,
Barco, Royal Allamande cavalry, (a
French regiment that came over with Du
mourier) have fuffered the moil. That
of Kavanaugh had 213 men killed, and
180 wounded. The loss of the other re
giments was in the fame proportion.
The French attacked us in all points at
once, with from 70,000 to Bo,oco men,
commanded by General Jourdan; Gen.
Dupont commanded their right. Le
vafleur ar.d Bentahole, the two Represen
tatives of' the people, appeared sword in
hand at the head of their combatants,
whom they animated with loud cries of ex
hortation to advance, and as loudly me
naced, when they seemed to hesitate.
Behind their firft. line, an immense number
of women, without fear or disorder, sup
plied the foldiere with ammunition, diftri
bnted brandy among them, and cairied off
the wounded: such were the means by
which they obtained a victory over our
brave and veteran tioops.
The cor.duA of the Dutch troops in
tins action is strongly talked of. It is very
confidently affirmed, that Byland's dra
goons fled outright, and left one of the
flanks of the main body, which they were
Rationed to cover, quite exposed ; and that
three whole companies went over to the e
nemy.
The Englifli, who came up juil as the
battle was beginning, were not in a condi
tion to display their accustomed valour and
intrepidity. They were exhausted by the
fatigues of a forced march of nine leagues.
Their cavalry were so out of order, that
they were unable to act.
The day before yesterday 400 French
prisoners, and 39 waggon loads of the
wounded arrived here. The night after
came a convoy of 52 waggons, v ith the
wounded of the regiments of Cobourg
and Kaunitz : and yesterday morning 68
vaggons, with the wounded of several o
'ier regiments. Where to lay these un
jrtunate victims of war we know not.â
All the hospitals and all the convents are
already full. Lint, bandages, and atten
dants on thcfick, are advertised for. On
Saturday last the general return of the
Auftrians wounded in the Pays Bis, was

He cannot answer for maintaining his pre
- "t position ; that he expects to he attac
ked in a few days ; and that the Frcnch
have augmented their army of the north,
to 170,000 men. He complains of the
Dutch, and even of the English. The
inflant that troops arrive here they are-sent
to join the army; as are all the (lores and
ammunition, which arrive in quantities al
most incredible, from Holland.
On Saturday morning an officer arrived
here with the important intelligence that
Gen. Wurmfer, on the 13th,attacked the
lines of Weiflembourg, with the Aultri
ans and Heflians ; that after an action of
11 hours, the lines were forced, and the
French camp behind them attacked by as
sault ; that the Duke of Brunfwiek hav
ing turned their army attacked them at
the fame time in the rear ; that the car
nage was dreadful, more than 14,000 of
the French and Auftrians having fallen;
that Gen. Wurmfer took poflefiion of
Weiflembourg and Lauterbourg, and pnr
fued the French to the gates of Straftnirg
âthat 168 pieces of heavy cannon, all
their baggage and ammunition, with 2900
prisoners were taken from the enemy. The
Auftrians had 3 joo men killed. The
number of wounded is not yet ascertained.
We are assured that Landau has offered
terms of capitulation, which the Pruflian
General, who commands the siege, has re
fufed ; and that Stralburg will surrender
on the firft appearance of an army before
NIEUPORT, October 23
The attack which the Carmagnqls com"
menced yesterday upon our town, and
which continued to-day, would certainly
have reduced the place, but for the inun
dation, which though very unpromising at
firft, about five o'clock in the afternoon,
began to succeed so well, that at fix the
whole flat country around the town was
overflowed about two feet high, and we
saw the Carmagnole with a great deal of
difficulty wading through the encircling
flood. As the next tide, which comes in
to-morrow morning about four, will raise
it at least two feet higher, we are pretty
sure that the Sans Culottes will move off
during the night, as quiet as poflible; and
we are in hopes that they will not be able
to save their artillery, which, as far as we
already know, consists of four twelve
pounders, and four howitzers.
This attack was, no doubt a part of an
an extensive plan, concerted by the com
mittee of public fafcty, to fall at one and
the fame time upon our whole chain of
positions from Nieuport to Maubeuge ;
and if pofiible, to strike a grand and de
cisive blow before the end of the present
campaign. As far as it concerns Furnes
and Nieuport, it was executed in the fol
lowing manner:
The Carmagnols advanced yesterday
morniug in two columns against Fumes,
the one from Hondfchote on the cause
way, the other from Dunkirk, along the
canal, which goes from this place to
Fumes; each column consisted of obout
300 men. Our corps polled at Furnes
was about 1 zco men strong, but strange
to tell, had not one single cannon. Four
companies of the Legion de la Cha.rte,
who formed our advanced guard near Bul
lerlkamp, fought with the greatest gal
lantry, and out of eight officers, five were
wounded. The great superiority of the
enemy in number and artillery obliged our
troops about two o'clock to fall back.â
They retreated in good order to Schar
, (hoot. Our garrison was by this retro
gade movement encreafed to about 1000
men, but we had on our ramparts not
one heavy cannon, and our whole artille
confifted of a few fix pounders and field
pieces.
The Sans Culottes made their appear
' ancc before our town yesterday evening,
and began to treft a battery near the Pe
lican, and situated on the right fide of the
canal, about half a mile from Nieuport.
; We fired a few (hot against the battery,
' but without efFeft. This morning at half
part nine o'clock, a French tnimpeter ar
rived with the usual fuir.mons, wherein
the commanding General of the Carmag
nols allowed our Commandant, the Hessian
Colonel Wurmb, a quarter of an hour to
consider on his proposals to surrender.-â
The answer was, that the garrison were
determined to defend themselves to the
last extremity.
At twelve the cannonade began upon
the town, and unfortunately the very firft
(hell thrown into the place, fell into a bay
loft near a diltillery and set it in flames,
which threw all the inhabitants into the
utmost conftcrnation. We returned the
enemy's fife 2: well as we Could, but, hav
ing no heavy cannon, and feting no pof-
Ability of laving the town by: any other
means, but -that of inundating the sur
rounding country, the neceflity of our
situation forced us to adopt it.
A little after three o'clock the firlt
sluice was opened, but with so little effect,
that, despairing of success, our Command
ant gave orders, that whillt the cannoneers
and a part of the garrison continued firing
upon the enemy, the rcit lhould begin to
file off towards Oftend.
A great part of the garrison had alrea
dy left the town, when, about four o'clock
the opening of the second sluice having
been effc&ed, the inundation aofwered
onr moll sanguine expectation. The troops,
which were on their march to Oftend,
thcu received orders to return, and an of
ficer was fenr to General Ainflie, with the
important i; Â« s of our unexpe&ed relief;
whiltt from our ramparts we enjoyed to
fee the corifternation and fright us the dif
appointcd Carmagnole banditti,, wading,
to and fro through the encircling
like so many ducks, without knowing on
which fide to turn to effect.their escape.
The fnbjoined copy of the summons,
sent us by the Gciu-ral of the Cnrmr.gnols
is taken from the original, and is highly
worthy of the perlon who penned it:
To the Inhabitants of Nieuport,
" The 2d day of the Ift decade of the
2d month of the 2d year of the French
Republic, one and indivisible.
(This is October 23.)
" I summon you to surrender your
selves immediately to the victorious arms
of the Frcnch Republic, before wh ch e
very thing mult yield : and that fix citi
zens repair to my camp ; âin failure of
which, surrounded and attacked as you
are both by sea and land, your town lhall
be laid waste, and I will enter it over the
fmoaking allies of your houfe3, and .the
palpitating remains of your members.
" Let the example of Furnesbe a warn
ing to you not to rely on those who call
themselves your defenders; and who ca
lumniate us, becjufe we beat them.

F i ench troop 3 before Nieu-
port.*'
TOULON.
From the camp under Oilioules, Oft. 8,
Th.e enemy this night surprised one of
our redoubts under favor of the treachery
of some Marfeillois, who deserted to them,
and gave them the watch-word. The
corporal of the poll having advanced in or
der to receive the rallying word, was kil
led ; and the guard, who were alleep, have
been mr.ffacred. Some companies of Mar
feillois charged their fulils, which tendec
only to cncreafe the disorder and butch cry
by firing on the guard of our battery fron
some mills, which they took for the ene
my;
The intrepid ChafTcurs of Burgundy
immediately advanced, on an afiurance
being given them that the poll was retaken.
They were aflailedby a ihowerof mufque
try, which they answered with courage ;
but were obliged to yield to numbers, after
leaving 16 killed and wounded upon the
spot. In the number of the latter is the
brave Malathie, a Captain, who, urged by
his courage, has been taken prisoner.-â
Several of our Marfeillois fled to St. Na
aire.
This defeat is principally to be attribut
ed to the cowardly grenadiers of Mont
Blanc, who fled firft.
The enemy .feeing that it would be dan
gerous to remain much longer matters of
the redoubt, which they had surprised,
spiked our cannon and mortars, the moun
tings of which they burnt, and retired.

TO THE PUBLIC.
THE undernamed committee, appointed bv
" THE SOCIETY for the INSTITU.
TION and SUPPORT of FIRST-DAY or
SUNDAY SCHOOLS in the city of Philadel
phia and ihe diftrift of Southwark and the
Northern Liberties," to solicit further fubfenp
tiona for the support of the fchooli which the
'Â° c "'y cftijyhfhed, take the liberty to
represent to their fellow citiaeosâ
Tfcat, although the fchooW were suspended
during the period of the late awful calamity
with which our Â«ity and suburbs have been af
flifled, they are now again opened for the free
ad million and education of poor children.
That, the neceflity and rtafona for the eflab
lifhment *f these school* are increafrd, from the
circumstance of the late distress having left a
number of Orphans deUitut* of all the means
of education, save what the hand of benevolence
may administer.
That, former experience has, mod pleasingly,
verified the fondeft hopes of the friends of this
institution, with regard to the progrefa and ad
vancement of the children, who hav* heretofore
been under its care, in the ufeful branches of
education which it has afforded. Referring to
this fact, and to the address to the public, on
this fubjr&, pubhfhed in the newspapers of thia
city >n the third month last, when about eight
hundred and twenty children of both sexes h*d
partaken of the benefits afforded by the society,
and about three hundred and twenty mora were
then actually receiving inftru&ion in their
schools, it now only remains to be observed,
that the funds of the society are greatly infuffi.
cicnt to carry on their benevolent designs, and
that the committee formerly appointed to solicit
fubferiptionf, conceived it neciflWy to decline
k- r a PP'' ca^Â®n * lo iheir fellow-citir.ens for
their afliftance in favor of these schools, in order
that theie might be no interruption from them
to the solicitations then made in behalf of their
iflifortunate brethren from Cape-Francois.
The public aid_is now therefore e.arneftly so
licited to eftablifhmenr, cal
culated upon thf^rfheipleiof public and pri
vate good. TUV annual fubjficription for a mem.
her is but Otje Dollar; ajid it is prefumcd thai
so small a sum per annum cannot be better diÂ£
posed of, by those who can afford it, than by
bestowing it as the price of the diffufion of ufeful
knowledge among the pÂ«or and friendlefs.
Subfcnptipni and donations will be gratefully
received by the undernamed committee on be
