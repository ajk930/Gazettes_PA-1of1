Philadelphia.
The foil owing published in the American Star,
contains fundryparticulars refpefiing tbeFrcncb
and English fleets which tad not before, bun
laid bt fom tfje public.
Details of the division of the French fleet,
which failed from Brest in November, 1793.
Six men of war and two frigates, com
manded by Rear- admiral Wanftable, failed
from Brelt about the end of November, and
cruised between d'Ouefiant and Cape Ltfc?.rd.
They took 17 English prizes, amongfl which
were merchant vessels from the fpnr quarter*
of the world.
The ioth day of their cruise, being twenty
five leagues Weft of d'Ouefiant they had
fight of the Englilh fleet, composed of twenty
fix men of war, and a number of frigates and 1
corvets, which gave chafe with a fair wind to
the French fleet, whom it endeavoured to
keep from the land, by means of an oblique
course, made between them and the land.
It was at this time that Lord Howe, believ
ing that the French veflels could not escape
him, detached an advice-boat to announce tile
capture of the French squadron.
The rear-admiral Wanflable perceiving
the design of the Engli/h admiral, took to
flight, and steered in such a manner as made.
Lord Howe believe that he designed to run
out to sea, and this was what aided him alll
the time he could not be perceived*
In this interval, an English frigate having
approached a French one, brought her can
non to bear ; the former left her and pufted
hard towards the veiTels of the Rear-admiral,
who gave the enemy's frigate a hroadiidej &
the Englilh not being willing to receive ano
ther, steered off towards the thickest of his
fleet.
As soon as night came, Wanftable made
a lignal to extinguish all the fires and lights,
and to change the course. He immediately
made an E. S. E. direction, till judging hitr
felf to be between the north and south of Bel
lifle, he (leered for it to convince hi mfelf, &
found the land so nigh that he entered Brett
without any accident. By this dextrous man
oeuvre he escaped the enemy, and had in cafe,
of any unlucky rencounter, the fort of . 1-
lisle for a protestor, or the bay of Tibercu.
for a refuge.
Lord Howe having miffed a prey, which
he regarded as certain, returned into the bay
of Falmouth. Ihe French squadron being
certain of this, and not imagining that fix
veffeU could make any way against 16, im
mediately put to sea and fleered for America.

Jn committee of the whole on Mr. MaJifon's
resolutions.
[continued.]
Mr. SEDGWICK'S SPEECH
Mr. S- laid that although he had been
absent during the discussion of this im
portant subjeCt, yet he could not consent
to give a silent vote, though he had not
the vanity to suppose he could give new
light; yethavingon a queftionof m gnitude
accultomed himfelf to speak as well as vote
his sentiments, he would not n(iw omit it;
he felt the propriety of apologifiug on this
occalion :âlt was said that the measure
was popular, and that the opppfition was
reprobated by the people, if so, it would
be mean and base in him to ill rink from a
participation with the gentlemen, with
whom he J>ad so long acted, with perfect
fatisfaftion to his own mind.
The question was now presented, as
doubtless it ought to be, dire&ed only to
G- B. and propofmg a- discrimination a
gainst her. The object was, to compel
that couHtry to relax the severity of hÂ«r
commercial regulations, and to put her
intercourse with this country, on a more
favourable footing to us. That all this
was to be effected by lefTening our trade
with G. B. and diverting it to other chan
nels.
When to all this it was replied, that
the present conduct of G. B. put such re
gulations at defianceâthat so far from
shewing a dread of such a iyflem, (he was
pursuing measures, which as far as in her
power, threatened our commerce with an
nihilation : that at such a time to attempt
by the proposed measures, to bend her
views to our wiihes was absurd. That at
this time, if there was a ray of hope, to
avoid the calamities of war, every mea
sure which was at the fame time irritating
and ineffectual fliould be avoided. To
these objection, it was answered, was war
inevitable, the proposition ought now to
be adopted, as a commercial system to
come into operation, at the conclusion
of the war.âGentlemen who made this
answer, did not seem to remember that to
render it just, we mult poflefs a certain
knowledge of the events of the war :â
That the relative circumstances of the two
countries, might be mutually altcrel by
thole events, and that which might be
proper now, would be wholly improper
then.
As this question was merely of a com
mercial i a ure, he had regretted to fee
political considerations intermingled in the
debate. The antipathy that was mani
fefted to cne cou.,t y, and the friendly re.
gard to another, ought not to influence
the decision, Passion (hould he banished,
and just and c'ol calculations, on the
foundation of national interest alone di
rest our determination.
It wasnot nowa question, whetherG. B.
had infli&ed political injuries on this coun
try, whether {he aided the savages of the
wildemefs, in the murder of our citizens,
whether (he had let loose upon us the more
barbarous savages of Africa, or whether
(he had committed piratical t'epredations
on our commerceâif th *fe farts were so,
and justice could not be obtained by nego
ciation, though he should deprecate war
a 6 an evil of great magnitude, yet (hould
justice be denyed us, he should then seek
redress with as much firmn.-fs he hoped as
most men. In such a warfare, he (hould
hope for vi&ory ; there was he believed
no foundation for such hope in the war
&re, contemplated by the p,opofitions be
fore the committee.
He laid it down as a maxim that the go.
Ycrnment of every country, in all its deli
berations ftiould be influenced onlv by
considerations of public good. To do
juliice to all the world, religiously to per
form its contra&s, these were to be scru
pulously obfcrved, for they were always for
the public good. A private man might
indeed, practice disinterested benevolence
to any extent, his humanity and generoli
ty might di&ateâa public man, had no
such authority. Did America he a (Iced,
owe a debt of gratitude to France, whence
derive we the authority to discharge it ?
Is such debt due, who shall calculate thi
amount? How much of the blood, of the
treafwe, of the prosperity of onr country,
will ease us of this load of obligation ! '
He said be did not wish to depreciate
the merit of France, her efforts were glori
ous to herfelf, and beneficial to this coun
tiy. That he might, hoover, be per.
mitted to recall the remembrance of the
committee to her conduit. He then ex*
hibited a view of that conduit, front
which he concluded that every thing
which was done, had its foundation in a
cool and temperate calculation of national
benefit. That this indeed, was the only
legitimate motive to national measures.
That other countries could always calcu
late their measures upon national interest,
and he ftneerely hoped the government of
this conntry would do the fame. "To
do otherwise" laid he, " is quixotismâit
it is crusading for the salvation of otherÃ,
and not ourselves." He hoped therefore,:
that no part of our assent to the propositi
on immediately under coniideration, would
be expected either from gratitude on the
one hand or refeutment on the other,
He said he should proceed to consider
whether it was for the interett of Ame
rica, that this proposition (hould be a
dopted. The objects are to leflen credit,
to controul commerce by diverting it frcm
its ancient channels, to encourage naviga
tion and manufa&ures ; and the motive
was that Great Britain poflefled a greater
portion of our trade than (lie was entitled
to from her disposition and ccndudt to-
wards us,
He could not help premising that the
featuies of the system were strongly mark
ed with a disposition to controul men in.
the economy of private life and the ma
nagement of their fortunesâwhy else not
permit them to extend their credit when
in their opinion it may be ufeful to them ?
Such measures, for such purpose could on
ly be juitified on a pretence that ourcoun-.
trymen were deficient either in wisdom or
in prudenceâ-A pretence which if not
insolent, always had, and always would
be found mischievous, because the great
bulk of every community were more com
petent to the management of their own
private concerns than the government wo'd
pretend to be.
The whole fyftcm is dire&ed toward!
Great Britain, and the obje<3 is declared
ly coertion. The confluences molt be
either, I it, that Great Britain would sub
mit; 2d, that (he would withdraw her ca
pital and relinquish a commercial connexi
on with us; or 3d, that flie would coun
teradl our regulations by legislative pro
vilions.
Suppose Great Britain should be com
pelled to fubmiflion, it would not be ima
gined (lie would do it immediately ; and in
the mean we mud fuller much distress. It
was true, he said, we had many other
commercial connexions, but in these we
did almost the whole of the carrying
none of the nations to whom we are thuÂ»
allied having any considerable (hipping to
spare for cur purposes ; nor was there any
probability that they would immediately,
if at all, furni(h us with any considerable
supply. We mud therefore depend on
ourselves. In a country circumstanced at
this was, it was to be expected there would
always be a deficiency of commercial ca
pital ; because there were so many objeflt
to which capital could be profitably ap
plied. The object of the resolution under
confederation, was to divert capital from
branches in which it was at present gain
fully employed to others. The branch
wus at prefant overftccked; yet a diversi
on mull take place, for (hips must be built
or our produce % could rot go to market,
but must perish on our hands. Manufac
tures, too, must be eftablilhed, or our Ci
tizens could not be supplied with the ne
cessaries and conveniences for which they
now depended on other countries; and
they mull do without them until our na
vigation is fufficiently encreaftd. What
effects, he alked, were to be produced by
a direrfion, and tfat immediately, of one
half of our commerce from its ancient and
natural channels ? Was there nothing to
be feared for the preferrotion of the pub
lic credit, wh:ch this commerce was to
lupport ? Nothing for the prosperity and
happiness of oar country >
But what be (aid, appeared atmo& far.

Strange and absurd suppositions were
made to lay the foundation on which to
build this system. It was fnppofed that
without any considerable distress of our
citizensâwithout a (hock to public cre
ditâwithout (hipping to export or im
portâand, with a deficiency of commer
cial capital we could divert, and that im
mediately, half our commerce from its
natural channels, while Great Britain,
mull be ruined, or at lead compelled to
submission, by a diversion of a (mall por
tion of hers, altho' (lie had (hipping to
transport thro' the world and more com
mercial capital than any nation on earth.
" Take care, fir, (aid lie,' I beseech you,
that led astray by resentment, gratitude or
refined theory, the curse of modern times,
you do not dillipate your goodly inherit
ance." Gentlemen had said, our consti
tuents are improvident, that the exttntion
of credit afforded the means of difllpation ;
let usdeltroy thÂ»fe means. " Strange doc
trine laid he, and unfounded as strange !
We have no right to aflame the character
of their guardians in this refpeÂ£t. There
are not as has been jultly (tated by a gen
tleman from Virginia, (Mr. Lee) any
mea. by which this can be justly done,

ment, and enforcing a prompt and im

Was Great Britain to relinquifii her
commercial connexion with us, though to
Ijer it would be a misfortune, yet to us it
would be a very unhappy event. Ever
since he could remember, it had been the
fafhionable cant to exclaim against credit ;
yet under a system of credit, .America had
enjoyed un :ampLd proipeiity. That in
his op.nion, experience was the only un
erring dire&or in political investigations.
The commercial intercourse between G.
Brita n and America would continue, should
this system be adopted or it would cease In
either cafe or in a mean between the two, the
'burthens created by it would fall principally
if not wh6lly on our citizensâShould it con
tinue, it w: uld be a charge on our imports
and exports to be fatisfied by the labor and
industry of our people. On our exports be
cause in all foreign markets the produ&s of
our country have to sustain a competition
with the fame species of the produce of other
countries âA hogshead of tobacco for instance
has its price determined by the demand for
it compared with the capacity of supplying
that demand by this and other countries ; an
indemnification for the additional expence
.cannot be obtained in the sales; it must there
fore be an expence in the labor and industry
which produces the article. On our imports
the fame will be the cafe, for a merchant will
not continue to supply a market which will
not indemnify him for all his expences, and
besides afibrd him his usual profits. In this
cafe also there would be no other source of
indemnification but the labor and industry of
the country. Under the preflure of these
burttens the reduced price of exports and the
' enhanced price of imports, how altered from
its present happy state, would be the condi
tion of our'planters and farmers ?âlf the in
tsrcoyrfe should not continue, thenftiould we
destroy our best markets, deprive our people
of the most valuable source of supply, and
destroy too, the best means of supporting
the public credit.
It remained Mr. S. said, to be considered
what effects would probably result from G.
Britains meeting our regulations with coun
teracting reftriftions. But previous to an
immediate confederation of this question; it
would be proper to enquire whether the com
mercial conduct of that country towards this
would jullify this measure as a mean of reta
liation ?
He said that he believed the condu# of G.
Britain, had on this lubjedt of commere,
been too limited and narrow. That this was
particularly true as refpe&ed a commercial
intercourse between America and G. Britain
and her dominions in the Weft-Indies. But
it should be remembered that she was an in
dependent nation, and as such had a right to
consult and pursue her own interest. That
until she should be convinced that a more
liberal and enlightened policy was for her
benefit, it not be expe&ed that file
would facrifice her own interest to our bene
fitâ-That she would be at the expence of
maintaining and supporting her colonies, that
we might participate in the profit. That all
we could in realon demand of her was, that
flie should not discriminate against us, but
that her condudl should be as favorable to us
as to other independent nations. Was her
conduct influenced by the considerations
which have produced the resolution before
us ? did she single out America as the only
objedt of her resentment, the ardor with
which this measure was pursued, would
have fusficient foundation for its juflification.

" I arrived from Toulon, my dear friend,

3 o'clock in the morning. After having
bombarded that infamous city durhig twelve
hours, the enemy evacuated it with precipi

they set fire to those of our ships, which they
could not carry along with them, as likewise
to the Arsenals. The city is now all in flames,

Baron Steuben has been to take a view
of the harbor of this city, to ascertain,
for his private fatisfa&ion, the bell place
for ere&ing fortifications. We hear he
is decidedly of opinion, the best place is
at the Narrows, several miles from this
city. This place was contemplated by
the British, during the last war, in cafe
they had been necefiitated to guard the
city from an attack by sea. It is judged
that resistance at that place will he as ef
fe&ual as any other, and certainly a stand
at a distance from the citv will be the moil
eligible.

For the Gazette of the United States.
Mr. Fenno,
IN the heat of party rage, we are very
apt to overlook every question which ought,
to determine our proceedings. I would wifli
to recal to the recolle<flion of our country
men, that the firft insult and wrong since the
commencement of this war, was given by
this country against EnglandâThey will flop
to refle<fl that in our eagerness to fulfil our
treaty with the French, we fuffcred them
(and have continued to doit to this mo
ment* ) to fell their prizes in our ports, con
trary to the usage of neutral nations in time
of war, and not stipulated in any treaty with
the FrencTi, and lately declared by our Fede
ral court to be illegal ; (fee their late deter-
mination) we did this even without giving
any formal notice to the British court, and
prizes have been fold, I believe nearly, if
not quite equal in value to what property
they may have in the Weft Indies of curs.
The Bririih minrftry have complained of
this, and have declared that they will look
for restitution. Can we therefore vender
that they have done the fame by us ? But I
am not yet convinced that they have kept
their intentions a secret from us, because I
read in our papers, an extra<ft from the Bri
tish papers of date the ill of Jan. which came
by the way of the Weft Indies, wherein the
people of England are infonned that their
government were about to take such mea
sures against American veiFels j and it was
very finguiar that a newspaper should be in
porfeffion of this intelligence, & Mr. Pinck
ney could not obtain it. lam rather inclin
ed to believe that the veflel which was to
bring us the intelligence has been loft or tak
en.
This being the cafe, I would ask what
right have we to seize any individual proper
ty in this country, when we have been the
firft to give the offence, and continue to do it
without offering any excuse, palliation,
or apology to the Britiih government.
Ityh March, 1794.
P. S. What has been the, conduct of the
Danish government ? The privateers of
France carried several Britilh prizes into their
ports, and so far from fuffering them to fell
them, they would not fuffer them to depart
with them as is the usage, but gave them up
to the owners again.
