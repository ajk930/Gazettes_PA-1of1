ACCOUNT of the FACTORY at
PATERSON, NEW-JERSEY.
i Letter to a gentleman in this City.
Paterfon, January 16, 1794.
Dear Sir,
In anfv/er to your enquiry refpeiting tlie
present situation of the Faftorv here, and
the progress made in conftrufting the cot
ton-mill, for water spinning, and the canal
â¢ designed to bring the water on the wheel,
&c. I have to observe to you, that the
cotton-mill is now under coverâthe inside
i carpenter work nearly cumpleatcdâthe
| large water-wheel is finiihedâand that e
, very part of the building (to accommo
date eight drums that turn 768 spindles,
together with all the neceflary machinery
for preparing the cotton for spinning)
may be calculated on, as out of hand bv
the fiift of May. At that period two
drums may be fafely calculated on as
ready for work ; and that the remaining
fix drums, will be got ready fcr use, as
fact as children can be taught to perform
the working them to advantage.
The mill anil machinery neceflary for
commencing spinning by water, may there
fore fafcly be calculated on as ready for be
ing pnt in operation by May day. As to
the Canal, the part on the rock, designed
to take the water from the natural bed of
the river, is fioifhed, and die flocd gates
ercdied, so at entirely to com
mand the waters of the Paffaick, in
the summer season. The dam across the
gully, below the rock, is also finiihed
and the canal from thence to the mill is in
such a state of forwardnefs as to juftify
very sanguine expectations of its being
compleated in all April; should the spring
prove favorable for working abroad. At
any rate, there seems 110 reason to doubt,
but that the mill will be in work, with
200 spindles, in all the month of Mayâ
and still less reason to doubt of the machi
nery's being conftrufted on the most ap
proved plan ; as the carding, drawing and
roving machines, for preparing cotton for
â  water spinning, are now actually at work,
by means of two horses ; âthe rovings
they make are spun into excellent yarns on
mulesâof which two are in constant work
for account of the Society. There can
therefore be no reason to doubt the know
ledge or abilities of Mr. M. who superin
tended this Branch. He has heretofore
labored under great embarrafiinents for
want of able mechanics ; but these diffi
culties are daily leflening ; as well from
the arrival of mechanics and machine
makers from Europe, as from those for
merly employed by him, having now
made themselves matters of the different
branches in which he has instructed them.
The completing the machinery forthe mill
is therefore rendered easy and sure ; there
can be no doubt of having the best of ma
chines ready as fact as hands can be taught
to work them. The work which this mill
is calculated to turn out, weekly, will
juftify the most sanguine expectations that
those manufacturers who are daily flock
ing to this free country from the defpo
tifm of Europe, will consider Paterfon as
the mofteligibleplaceforthem tocommence
business a new-that the manufafturesof cot
ton goods of differentkinds.madeby private
adventurers, on their own accounts, will
furnilh a ready market for all the yarns
made at the fattory. This, with the
command of water which the focicty will
have fccured by means of their canal and
dam, and the great number of mill feats
which they may calculate to fell, must in
duce manufacturers of every difcription
to fix themselves here in preference to any
other part of the continent. The fa!e6 of
house lots will be encreafed, and the funds
of the society for active operations there
by augmented; and the expectations which
the public seem to haveformed from fixing
the fa&ory here in some mealure realised.
To convince you this is not all ideal,
I can allure you that a number of prin-
[Whole No. 45)6.]
tcrs, &c. who have lately arrived on this
continent from England and Ireland, have
formed themselves into a company, for the
pnrpofe of bleaching and printing calicoes
and chintz hereâand are a&ually at work
with two tables. They perform every
part of the work themselvesâsuck aj
drawing, cutting, printing, bkrachl n&c.
T hey expect to go very largely into this
business in the fpiing. Another company
have commenced the manllfaflure of Hea
vy Cotton Goodsâand a third company
are forming for the msnufafluring of tJo
fcry on an extensive frale; fukahle build
ings being already ere&ed on the lands of
the focicty to accommodate them. Should
these. fuccecd, it will hold out additional
inducements to other adventurers to fix
themfelve6 here ; and thereby greatly pro
mote the views of the stockholders j as
well as augment their funds, extend their
operations and encreafe their intertft*
1 hat this may be the desirable issue of the
business, is the ardent wish of
Dear Sir,
Your mod obedient,
Humble Servant.
P. S. Sundry house lots have beert
already fold, and valuable buildings erect

applications for house lots will be nude
next springâand that the building < f

and care, of an individual's concern.
NEW-YORK, J a â, 22,
We are extremely happy to inform the
public, that the Amboy pafTage boat,
which left this city the 26111 of December
last, and which was fa id to have been lcil
on Long-Iflatid, was, after having been
eleven days at sea, drove into Martha's
Vineyard, after experiencing the gieateft
imaginable distress, both for the want of
provi (ions, as well as from bad weather,
which obliged them to cut away her mat
The lives of all, however, (one child ex
cepted) have been providentially preser
ved This grateful intelligence comes
by Captain White, from St. Thomas's,
who put in at Martha's Vineyard, in dis
tress, for v. ant of provisionsâHe bro't
with him all the paflengcrs of the Am
boy boat.

Mr. Nicholas's obftrvations concluded
HAVING (hewn, that the adtuai (late
of our comnÂ»t"ce is by no means the molt
beneficial, as f.ir a* navigation is. concern
ed, I will proceed toeonfider the benefits
derived from the confamption of those
K iropian m inufidtures, which form the
principal part, of tire (tores of American
â'and here it mav fafely be fa id, that na
tic:ir.l policy by no mean 6 juftifics the al
in >:l exclulive preference, given to those
of Great B itain. It is not always true,
that the comrrodity which is bought for
lead money is the bed bargain, for the
means of payment form an important con
fi deration i.i all tra flick, and accommoda-
lions in it, may more than counterbalance
an inequality of price. If one man wiil
receive an article in exchange which you
can fell to no other, it will certainly be a
fimiig to deal with him, at a high ad
vance on hb property. I there are conn- j
tries which would become great consum
er .of American produce, on the terms
of reciprocal coivfurnption, and we find a
difficulty, as b often the cafe, in vending
that produce, bit not of gieit national
importance to excite those acts, which are
tp become the foundation of the connec
tion, even if in'the fir!t instance, it is to
be attended with inconvenience and loss.
France may be made a connection of this
fort ; (he is at tHil time, aimoft if not
quite, on a footing with Great Britain in
the cor.fumptiun of American products,
and every hand which (hall receive em
ployment from us, will add to her wants.
We are told that it is cf no !efs import
ance to us, to find a country which can
supply usadvantageoully, than one which
will consume our product ions, and that
as commerce b uo longer carried on bv
barter, it is no lew beneficial, to fell in
one country and buy in. another, than if
we could compleat the exchange in the
fame country. This might be true if yonr
pruduction was limited, and the demand
lor it certain, but with a greatly improv
ing agriculture, and some risque nv our
markets, trie object b important. Great
Britain being the faStory of those things
which would make her moil dependent 011
the agricultural irttereft, and the natiopa!
wealth being probably at the greatest
height, there is no expectation that her
consumption will enereafe. On the other
hand, aÂ« labour is now to receive its direc
tion in France, to the manufacturing arts
f-ifar as concerns America, you will take
from the agricultural strength, a large
class of people, and by that means create
a dependance on you, at lead to the a
mount of their own consumption, and the
wealth you will dilFufe, will give ability
. tothoufnnds who are now too poor to bid
fijr your commodities. Nor is it proba
ble, that you will purchase this important
benefit,on very disadvantageous terms, for
it is .agreed on all hands,that many import
ant ;r Â»t. are well understood there, & that
labour, which forms the principal part of
t'u. coit 1-â¢ mod articles, is considerably
cheaper ii France, than in England.
Another very important operation, of a
discrimination in favor of France, will be
that by encouraging liberal induftrv, you
may put an end to some practices, which
in the exiltingftate of confumptiongreatly
depreciates our commodities, I mean the
public provision made in granaries, and
the supply from them in times of scarcity
whicti destroy the competition that raises
every thing to its jult value. Different
confcquences have been foretold, as likely
to rcfult from those measures, to which I
(hall give a (hort examination. We are
told that the preference long since given
by our laws, has been equal to a prohibi
tion of British veflels, and that to the ex
tent to which it has gone, the bed effects
have been produced. To secure this ope
ration from a recent attack, and at the
famr time to extend it to some branches
of trade, to which its principle would e
qually extend, is the objedt of the marine
resolutions. We have no reason to appre
hend bad confcquences, from an action
which has hitherto had good confequen
cci. As to the increased duties on manu
fadtutc#, I think the profpeA in no -vay
threatening, for if there should be found
no count ly to supply our wants on better
term-, the diminution of cor.sumption
will be only in proportion to the duty.â
This can be by no means alarming, con
fide red as the worst confequenee of the
meafhre to men with whom the irnpoll is
the favourite mode of collecting the reve
nue, at a time when the public wants are
equal to any poflible produce. If there
(hall be found a competitor with Great-
Biitain fur our consumption, the great
objedt will be attained, as it must be ac
companied by acort efponding confumpti
-011 of American produdtiona. But we
arc told that there will be a conflidt of
commercial regulations be I ween this coun
try and Great Britain, and that the con
sequence will be, the loss of the market
(lie affords us. The probable consequen
ces of such a conflict will belt determine
whether it is to be expeftcd,asit will com
mence on her part as well as ours, with a
view to confequencec. The danger which
(lie can alone apprehend, is the loss of the
market for her manufadtures, and to obvi
ate this, it would be absurd to widen the
breach between us, as that would tend in
a diredt propoition, to the eltabhfhment
of unfriendly habits and manufadtures, ei
ther here or in other countries, which
would rival her ow:i. If however, the
ultimate advantage would juft-.Fv such mea
sures, die immediate distress of her peo
p'e, would forbid it. The American
trade muit be the means of diltributing
bread to several hundred thousand persons
vrhofe occupation would be wholly ended
with the trade, and the government i 3 by
no means in a situation to bear their dif-
content,
Their navigation and manufa&ures draw
many important ingredients from Ameri
ca which would be loft to them. The cre
ditors of the people of Amcrica to an
immense amount wjuld be deprived of the
remittances which depend on a friendly
intercourse. Oil the whole it would add
to the disorders of the government among
those who, perhaps, have heretofore con
tributed to its support, without gratifying
thing but an arrogant resentment:
but we are told that our own citizens
would be equal lufteters and are more to
be injured by being stopped in a career of
rapid improvement: it will be hard to an
ticipate any real misfortune to America,
in such a contest, unless the temporary
loss of indigencies which are by no means
lieceflary, can be so called. The consump
tion of Great-Britain is, according to the
most friendly calculation not more than
one third of our purchases from her, and
therefore the national wealth, independ
ent of the gratification of our appetites,
will leceife an immense addition and a
vast fund will be procured to make lading
and valuable improvements which would
be'degraded by compaiifon with the gew
gaws of a day. It is to be remarked, that
the diminution of our exports would be
divided among large dalles of people,and
in all cases forms a deduction from the an
nual incomeratherthan a total loss: this will
result from the various objects of Ameri
can industry and the divilion of the mar
kets of its produce. This forms an im
portant difference between America and
Great-Britain, in an estimate ot the ef
fects of a rupture between the two coun
tries. In my opinion the habits of the
southern dates are such as to require the
controul which is said to be the conse
quence of these measures ; under the fa
cility offered by the modes of trade before
spoken of and the credit which is said to
be so beneficial; they have not only in
volved themfejves in debt, but have con
trasted habits which with the power of
gratification mud always keep them so.
We did hope that the adminidration of
justice would have corrected the evil, but
we now find that it cannot be corrected
but by entire changes ; it is founded in
the policy of the merchant himfelf and
this circumstance is enough to present to
the minds of the committee a long train
of dependent mifchiefs; it is a fact sup
ported by the best evidence, that our mer
chants who get their goods from the ma
nufacturer pays as much for them as the
(hopkeeper who buys at Baltimore or Phi
ladelphia, this is one of the consequences
of the want of credit which always will
follow a reliance on collection from far
mer, and there caa be no doubt that the
merchant is indemnified for his disgrace,
as well as his advance. The result of the
whole train of indulgence is, that our
goods are bought at an advance from a
half to one fourth of what they could be
afforded for in -cacti sales; nor does the
miljUief stop here, it brings a subjection
which materially affects the sale of our
â produce. I do believe myfelf, that the
war with Great-Britain did not bring half
the ir.ifcKief on us that their credit has,
and'l very much suspect a credit for con
sumption will always be found equally
mischievous ; it by no means resembles
money loans as is insinuated by the gen
tleman from South Carolina, by freeing a
man's own resources for any other use ;
it is certain that there is no other fafe re
gulation of a farmer's expences than his
income, and experience every day proves
that when so regulated they always fall
(hort of the income and that when they
depend on credit they always exceed it,
and thereby fubjeft future revenue; lef-
fening the importation of foreign manu
factures will increase our household fa
bricks which experience has proved to be
highly profitable as the labor is done by a
part of the community of little power in
any other application. Regular efforts in
this way have been in my country certain
ly productive of independence.
It is acknowledged that we may derive
great advantages from France in our com
merce but it is said they (hould be secured
by treaty, and we (hould not pay before
hand for them. If advantages are to be
drawn by treaty from foreign nations, to
enable the executive to procure them we
mult advance the impost beyond the re
venue standard or they will have nothing
to give in exchange ; will gentlemen agree
to involve France in this measure indiscri
minately when wÂ« have already a commer-
cial treaty with her, which was concomi
tant with that treaty which gave us inde
pendence J will they under such proofs of
friendlinefs and while they are laboring
under a revolution that must strengthen
our connexion, fliew diflruft of their jus
tice when the diftin&ion now proposed
may give them a knowledge of those ad
vantages they may derive from our trade,
and thereby make them more eager for a
permanent contradl; it will be always in
our power when we find ourselves deceiv
ed, to restore the equality with Great-
Britain. We are asked what will bccome
of our revenue under such an establishment ?
the answer is obvious from my former ob
fervations, if the consumption is reduced
only bv means of revenue, the revenue will
encreafe ; if it is Jeflened by competition
it will not be diminilhed, for the present
rates will continue on all foreign goods,
and we (hall be better able to pay from
the improvement of our foreign markets ;
but if there Ihould be a diminution with
out lefiening the power of the people to
pay, what mifchief will there beâevery
body understands that the people pay the
revenue altho' it is colle&ed by custom
house officers, and there is reason to be
lieve, that the expence of collection is
greater in that way than any other, as
there is not only the apparent expence
but a secret compensation to the merchants
for advancing it.
But we are told, that we are including
countries, in the general description, which
are our best customersâSpain, Portugal,
the Hanfe towns and Denmark. It will
be found, that they are little within the
reach of the proportions, not being car
riers, and very little manufacturers of the
articles to be taxed. It will be in the
power of the Legislature to'fave them, in
tilling up the blanks, but this is not in
tended to shut out any nation, which
chufes to trade with us on liberal terms,
and if we are latisfied with our footing in
their trade, there is no doubt, but we can
secure it by treaty ; they' will not com
plain of our taking away benefits, which
they may refu'me at any time. We are
told that this business is merely commer
cial; and that we should not think of our
political relations to Great Britain ; but
in my opinion, mod of our grievances
have commercial objects, and therefore
are to be remedied by commercial resist
ance ; if you take away what is contend
ed fcr,conteft must end. The Indian war
and the AJgerine attack, have both com
mercial views, or Great-Britain must stand
without excuse, for instigating the most
horrid cruelties. I consider, however, the
proportions before yoti, as the strongest
weapon America pofTefTes, and the most
likely to restore her to all her rights poli
tical and commercial, and I trust I have
(hewn, that the means will have a benefi
cial effect, if they (hould fail as a remedy
with refpeft to Great-Britain.
[Delatt to le continued.']
From the Philadelphia Garutlc.
Mr. Brown,
Nothing cen be mare displeasing to a
lover of truth, than the pains which are
taken to imprefj the American public
with falfe ideas of the present fit nation of
France. Of this, the representation of
French affairs, said to have been brought
by Captain Culver, commander of the ad
vice boat lately arrived from Havre-de-
Grace, is an example.
The account really brought by Capt.
Culver, pr:fents a scene diftionorablc to
human nature.
He states, that from the vigilant seve
rity of government, a spirit of mutual dil
tri'.ft is predominant among the citizens
of Paris. That every man is afraid of his
neighbor. That executions are so frequent
as to have ceased to excite curiosity. Not
a day passing without some victims of the
guillotine more or fewer. 1 hat the place
where it stands is ahnoft continually wet
with human gore. That the head oj a
man seems to be of little more naltje than that
of a chicken. And as a proof of the flight
nefs of the causes which involve the facvi
fice of life, he mentions the instance of a
woman, who, having on her finger a ring
with apur de lis, was allied why (he con
tinued to wear it, to which replying that
(he had worn it for twenty years, and in
better times than theprefentâthe the day
following fuffered death by the guillotine.
In relation to the death of the Queen,
to which he was a witness, he mentions,
that as (he went along to the place of ex
ecution, (he was reviled and abused (chief
ly by women of the wofft appearance) ia
the most obfeene and (hocking mannerâ
all which (he bore with composure and
dignity ; which (he continued to exhibit
to the last fatal moment.
To crown the detail of attrocities, Cap
tain Culver adds, that every method iÂ»
taken to debauch and debase the mind of
the young dauphin, a child of seven or
eight years old, and that among the expe
dients for that purpose, hi? is kept m a
state of almofl constant intoxication.

STRASBOURG, Nov. 6.
The National Commissioners, it 18 said,
have discovered a~depot of 14 millions of
livres in specie, made for the purpose of
corrupting Strasbourg, and the department
of the Lower Rhine.
Several domiciliary visits were made thiÂ»
evening, which have produced a great
number of arrests. The revolutionary
army parade the street night and day.
Saint Just is making use of every endea
vor to put the army that covers this for
trefs on the most refpe&able footing. His
repeated representations to the committee
of public fafety, have procured a large
supply of heavy cannon, with a reinforce
vment of 3000 men belonging to the artil-
Lacotle, the other National Commis
sioner, is in this city, where he has adopted
every measure neceflary to induce the in
habitants to make a vigorous defence*
Yesterday he visited the Popular Society
of Stralbourg, in which he stated the
means he had 11 fed to supply the army
with those necessaries which they had loft
at Weiifembourg.
As a measure of general fafety, 80
priests, and several other fufpetted perfor.s,
have been Tent from Stralbov.rg to Befaq
con. Near 100 women have also been
sent away, because, it is supposed, that the
Combined Armies mean to attempt the
blockade of Strafbnurg.
LONDON, November 13
The, veteran Luckner, after his dismis
sion from the army, wished to end his life
in retirement; but 4o this there exists an
obstacle of which he had no conception,
The pofieflion of wealth is an unpardona
ble crime with the Sans Culottes j and as
he has grown rich by the profits of a con
trast he long held, for supplying the
French army with horses, this brave offi
cer, who not long ago was acquitted of all
malrerfation, and permitted to retire where
he thought fit, is now in confinement.
As he has a large estate in Germany, it
seems a want of forefight that he did not
retire thither.
All the BiitifK merchants Bpurieaux
have been arrcfted; each 19 abnfincd to a
separate room, with liberry to ua'fk in the
day time in a large garden, set ;>part for
the purpose. Seals have been placed on

Two framed houses were consumedâand

that a pestilential fever rages in several of

that the temporary powers vested in the

I take the present opportunity likewise
to inform you, that utilefs some Legilla

Mr. Bache's paper has a paragraph,
which, fays the friends of good govern
ment, disapprove the publications reced
ing the war. Many of them do. An
itch to meddle in European wars, is not
patriotic. To make a flourifh of zeal, in
the cause of either, (hews as little true
dignity, as prudence. It neither becomes
a nation profeffing to be neutral, nor one
that scorns to deal out blows that it would
not have returned. America, Hands too
high in the world's elteem, to be (hewn as
the bully or toad-eater of any power un
der heaven. Self refpeft will prevent in
sults on some, or a servile dependence on
any of them. Therefore, the paragraph
writer, may ehjoy the support of the
Georgia celebration, as much as he may
chufe. It was not by luch proceedings
that we escaped war. There is a sneer at
at the word good government âgood go
vernment is not ruling by a club-âit is not
by incendiariesâfitting out armed veflels
.while the government remains at peace.
It is not a good government, if it has not
ftrcngth and firmnefs enough to reilrain
such a faction from kindling a war.

and all goesright in Franccâis there one
of them that would not {hake in his (hoes

Encyclopedia, Vol. X.
JUST PUBLISHED,
By THOMAS DOBSON,
Bookleller, at the Stone House, ijrSecond
ftreet Philadelphia.
VOLUME X. OF
Encyclopedia; or Dictionary
Of A ts, Sciences, and Miscellaneous
Literature, on a Plan entirely new j
Br WHICH
The Different Sciences and Arts,
arc digejled into the form of
Diftinft Treaties or Syirems :
THIS volume contains principles of Levels,
Liberty, Du&rine of Light, Lightning,
Locks, Logarithms, Logic, History of Lon
don, Longicude. Luther, Lydia, Macedon,
Madagascar, Magic, Magnetism, Malts, His
tory of Man, Marriage, Mary, Maryland,
Masonry, Materia Medica, Meadow, Mecha
nics, with a great variety of Biographical and
Miscellaneous articles, illultrated with Twen
ty two Copperplates.
As a number of families are still in the
country, and it is not generally known who
areretuvned. T. D.)bfon, solicits the favor
of the subscribers to call or fend for their vo
lumes, that they may be supplied as early as
poilible.
The tenth volume of the Encyclopedia is
now presented to the public ; but as it makes
its appearance in an impcrfett state, some ac
count of the reason of that imperfe&ion should
be p_iven. On the Bth of September last, the
Publisher had the misfortune of having hÂ»s
Printing-Office burnt down by a fire which
broke out in the neighbourhood, and a great
quantity of his printing materials destroyed,
and among other articles, the riouÃEs, with
which he was printing the tables or lo
garithms, be'onging to the present volume,
were melted down by the violence of the fire.
As a supply of these could not be immediately
obtained, he was under the neceflity of pub
lifbing the volume without these tables; but
hopes he ftiall be able to publish them with the
next volume which is now in considerable for
wardnefs.
The Publiflier embraces this opportunity of
expressing his grateful acknowledgments to
the generous public, for the very liberal pa
tronage with which his undertaking has been
honored; at the fame time he takes the li
berty of representing to such of the subscribers
as are in arrears, the indifpenfible necefHty of
punctuality, both in taking up 'he volumes as
early as polfible after publication-, and of pay
ing for them when taken. Many of the sub
scribers having got only one, two, three, &:c.
volumes, and several volumes remain unpaid.
Thus the work hangs in all its different stages
from the commencement; and though the im
portance of a few dollars may be but a trifle
to the individuals, yet the accumulation of
these triftes unpaid lays the Publisher under
very serious embarraflment, and deprives him
of the life of many Thousands of Dollirs which
at this time would be of very efTen tial service.
For these reasons the Publilher finds himfelf
under the necefljty of recurring to the original
terms of publication, and in future no vo
lumes will be delivered but only to those who
take and pay to the time of publication.
