In the SENATE,
CONGRESS
House of Rcprefenhil'ives.
January 23.
In committee of the whole on Mr. Mcdifen's
resolutions.
Mr. Dexter, after a number of intro
ductory remarks, observed, that if he
could fee the resolutions on the table in
the light in which some gentlemen had la
boured to place them, he (hould be one
of their most Zealous advocates. They
had been stated as tending to relieve our
navigation and commerce from unequal
and unreasonable rellriÂ£tions imposed by
foreign nations, and to encourage Ame
rican manufactures. No man could have
these objefis nearer his heart than himfelf,
but he was not a little surprized to find,
from attentively considering the refuluti
ons, that their true tendency was not to
encourage American navigation, com
merce, and manufactures, tut thofc of
certain foreign nations, and by compelling
Americans to purchase at a dearer mar
ket, to ax them heavily for the benefit of
fonygriers.
was confirmed in this idea by fee
ing that the members from the eallern
Hates, which are particularly interested
in navigation and manufactures, as well as
thoGe of the bell mercantile information,
and who were actually engaged in foreign
commerce, were almolt unanitnoufiy op
posed to the Resolutions j though they
had been allured by the supporters of
hem, that they were to be peculiarly be-
nefited by their salutary operation. He
thought it very imprudent to diiturb the
present fettled and prosperous state of
commerce, which by documents before
the committee, appeared to be rapidly ad
vancing, and in lo doing to make import
ant and certain faciifices, when the con
sequent advantages were at best very un
certain. To commence a commercial war-
fare at the hazard of our trade, perhaps
our peace, for the benefit of flrangers was
ill his view, to betray the interelis of our
citizens.
that if it was intended to encreafe
the navigation of our country, it ought
to be done by discriminating duties in fa
vor of American (hipping, and not by di
minilhing the tonnage duty of vcffels of
â nations in treaty with us, as was contem
plated by one of the resolutions. Our
country had already experienced a surpri
sing increase of her navigation by the o
peration of this principle of discrimina
ting in favor of our ourselves ; and per
haps it might be augmented ttill further
by pursuing the fame principle.
Gentlemen, he said, had reprobated all
commercial reftriftionswithout considering
that this beneficial law of our country is
as truly a commercial reflriftion as the na
vigation ast of Great Britain. He con
sidered it as idle and arrogant, for Ame
rica to undertake to reform the commer
cial policy of the world.
All nations have laws regulating trade,
and we can neither persuade nor compel
them to abandon them. All we can do,
he said, is to malrefuch counter regula
tions as may consist with equal jul'tice, and
promote our own interest.
Mr. Dexter then briefly pointedout the
mode in which he thought manufactures
ought to be encouraged ; but he said the
resolutions had very different objects. He
proceeded by observing, that the body po
litic, like the natural' body, often suiTers
more from the bold ignorance of Quacks,
and the ingenious tho' falfe hypotlufes of
the learned, than from the malady com
plained of. The various pans of each
have infinite, minute, and inferutabk
relations and dependencies; and it may
be added that there is a natural effort i:-i
each, to relieve itfeff from difeale. He
said, he would purfuc this idea, and firfl
enquire whether the patient was lick, and
if it fliould so appear, then whether the

recipe on the table could proxnife a curs
If the Juvenile flute of our country is a
proof of dil'cafe, -then said he, our coun
try needs a phyfilSan-
He admitted that the cofnmerce oi (his
labors under numerous di fad van
tages, but he considered the most of them
as jieccfiarily resulting from our youth and
adventitious circumstances, rather thaii
from foreign laws of trade; and added*
that natural causes were constantly reliev
ing us, and rapidly pushing us forward to
majestic national maturity. In the mean
time wc ought to co ruole ourfelvts with
the thought, that though the succeeding
state of our country may be more fplen-
did, yet the present is probably molt vir
tuous and happy. It is in vain he said to
pant for premature manhood. To attempt
to obtain it by excess of nutriment would
only produce disease. Does the ftri; ling
he asked, take medicine because he is not
as athletic as his fire ?
Mr. Dexter further observed, that 6ur
duties on Briiifli ships, are greater alrea
dy than their duties on ours, and as a
consequence of this we fee that in the?
commerce between that country and this,
American tonnage has conflautly encrea
fed and Bricifli tonnage has as uniformly
decreased.. Indeed iince the pafiing or
the ast, imposing the eÂ»ilting duties on
foreign bottoms, our own navigation has
advanced as fwiftly as we ought to wifb*
and in a much greater ratio than the Bri
tifli tonnage ever did in tire lama ipacc of
time under their idolized navigation act.
Thcfe fftsfts appear from ilatemems oit
the table from our own offices. The Re
solutions he remarked are called retaliato
ry. What laws cf trade of any nation not
in treaty with us, impose on us iifnilar bur-
thens ?
Tho' we are refentful towards Bufeui),
let us be just even in our pafiions. She
mules many important discriminations in
favor of our navigation and produce in
her European dominions, which give us
many valuable advantages there over other
alien nations. These good offices we do
not in any instance reciprocate. She makes
no difcrimir.utions a gam ft us, unlds to
protect her own produce ar.d mantrfa&me*,
or in pursuance of her treaties. We have
already done the fame to her. It is true,
and it is much the mo ft exceptionable part
of her commercial policy, that her {land
ing laws exclude our (hips from her Ifianus
in the Weft Indies, tho* they admit our
produce, and this forms a valuable part of
our exports. Spain and Portugal the laf
ter of which we are told we ought to fa
vor as much as pofllble, and even to except
the former from these resolutions, not only
refufe our ihippfng hut every article of
our produce in their Weft India lfiands.
This however does not justify Britain in
prohibiting our navigation to her lilands :
but it {hews that even here (he treats us
better than other nations, whose commerce
we favor; and {he treats us better than
{he treats other nations $ for their produce
and manufactures are prohibited. Per
haps these confidenftions added to the pe
culiar advantages we have in the Britilh
European pofTefiions, which we do nut re-"
ciprocate, to foften our resent-
ment
It is fcarccly neeefiary to mention here,
that the advantages referred to in Biitifh
European markets, are being exempt fiom
payment of foreign tonnage, and earn
ing there some importa.it articles of A
merican produce free ; whiie similar art i
cles frrom other nations are heavily cuti
ed, and also carrymj there feme impor
tant exp< rts, fubjett to much less duties
than similar articles froirt other fofeigr.ei s.
Thcfe remarks are accommodated tj
the legal and not the actual Rate of the
Islands; for the prinriple of temporary luf
penf.on of the prohibitory laws, wlrch :a
common to all of them, is so varioufiy a;v
plied, that we Cannot reason about it.
Mr. Dexter further said, that rt had
been repeatedly mentioned by the gentle
man who muved thÂ« icfolutions.aud by
R.
sÂ°4v)if his colli? , 'es, that a nation ought to
,'rrv in prupuvtn.-n to the hiilk of her tx- i
jrv'b. 'lliis rule he said not to :

c
V
The countries lurchargcd with inl.s.iiunt*
ought rather to afford carriers for the pro- |
ihice of more happy nations, Wanting j
the moans of fubfiftencc at home they aie
compelled to plough the Ocean for bread.
It might as well be laid that every nation
(hould manufacture in proportion to its
coiifumptiou, and that every individual
(hould praClife all the mechanic arts iie
may have occafiou for. I ins is one of the
eai lieft and mod imperfeCt ideas of com
merce : Doubtless we ought to encourage
the carrying trade for the important pur
pose of public fafety, but not to pursue
it as a source of wealth. When we pro
ceed beyond that degree, which is necef
(ary for public security, we diminish the
wealth, population and agriculture of our
country ; we reduce our yeomanry to be
hireling laborers for foreign matters.âMr.
Dexter observed, that it had been said,
that the balance of our commerce with
Britain is much against. us ; this he agreed
is true, but he doubted whether the ba
lance of the aggregate of our commerce
were so. But even if this were alio true,
he said he (hould not be alarmed, as we
are a young country rapidly encrealing,
and the balanee against us might be viewed
as a loan from a foreign nation, and em
ployed by us in internal improvement,
which we can at any time repay, and re
ft rve a great profit thereon to ourselves.
It becomes capital in commerce ; it faci
litates our agricultural improvements. But
he added, that he was still less apprchen
five of danger from considering that the
nature of commerce forbids that such a
{lite (hould continue long enough essen
tially to injure our country. If we import
more than we export, the balance must
be paid in cadi or not paid at all. If it
be paid in caih, we soon drain our coun
try of specie, and what may then remain,
becomes from its scarcity more valuable
here than elit: where, and more valuable
than any thing we ran obtain for it in fo
reign countries ; and this at once reduces
juir imports to the amount of our exports,
or ftiii lower iu order to obtain a balance
in ipecie, which has now become the molt
valuable article. If we do not pay the
balancc at all, we soon lose our credit,
and there ends im]x>rtation. Revc,fe this
reasoning, and we flia'il be convinced that
we piufue a phantom, when we labor to
fccure a perpetual balance in our favor.
Caih soon becomes so plenty as to reduce
it* value, and consequently we exchange
it with foreigners for any gewgaws ; thus
v. e encreafe our imports until we lose the
furphis of currency.
We can no more keep it than we can
heap up water. It would be afelefs, nay
mischievous if we could keep it ; It would
enhancc the price of the neceflaries of
life , it would destroy that sober industry
and frugality, which form the loveliest
features in our national character.
We ought not then to wish for a bal
ance of trade perpetually in our favour,
or in other words for a constant increase
of currency ; but we ought to wish for an
increase of capital, and this is produced
as much by our imports as by our exports.
As then the exports from a country never
can for a long time greatly exceed its im
poits it follows that it is a mistaken po
licy to labour to lefien our importations,
because we thereby reduce our exports. â
The demand for them as a remittance will
ccafe, consequently they will cease to be
produced, and jdleivcis and poverty will
follow. Nature has made laws on this
fubjrrt which we cannot repeal.
But now, said Mr. Dexter, let us sup
pose what is in some degree true, that our
navigation and commercc are not in the
belt possible situation ; do the resolutions
afford a remedy. They cannot, if they
have no tendency to encourage either.â
They discriminate in favour of some fo
reigners against others, and compel us to
pay the difference of their markets, and
they leflen the duties on the commerce of
certain favourite foreign nations, thereby
lellening the.discrimination in favour of
our own. â¢
But it is said they will in their opera
tion, bv depriving the Britilh artizans of
the neceflaric* of life, and the raw mate
rials for manufactures, compel that nation
to open to us her Welt India ports, and
treat our nation more refpeftfully. As
so depriving them of the necessaries oflife
thev now refufe to take our provifions,and
this is one complaint against them : they
fc'ili aot fuffer more when we refufe to let
them go there. A time of scarcity only
can i'ive this effett, and none of the lefo-
lutions ordains a famine in Bntain ; aÂ» to
depriving them of raw materials,we know
not how much other nations can supply
when a new demand ardes, neceflity opens
new resources ; in this way we may cre-
ate to ourselves formidable and permanent
rivals.
Can we diltrefs tliem by refufing to
take their manufactures ' From statements
bv tlie mover of the refolutiono, it
appears that we take only 4 per cent, of
the whole amount of Britifii manufactures
âOnly the profit on this 4 per cent will
be loft by them, for the law materials
they are not to have from 115, and the la
bour of manufacturing will of course be
saved.
But even this profit will not be loft to
themi for by consuming the manufactures
of other nations, we (hall make a demand
in those nations, and Britiih manufactures
will go there to supply the place of those
we may take ; nay mere, we shall take
even Biitifh manufactures from other na-
tions, and the expence of a double voy
age, dcpofit, and cotr.miffion will be ad
ded to the Price of the articles. In the
mean time our bulky articles of export,
the value of which will not pay for the
enhanced expences of transportation, will
perilh ; being forbidden the usual market
and advantages.
Mr. Dexter asked, is this a time for
making experiments ? All Europe is in
agitation, and our commerce mult partake
of it ; we steer our bark on the margin of
a whirlpool j there are seasons when it
ought to latisfy us that we do not go
backward.
It is easy suddenly to do mifchief which
the wisdom of many succeeding years can
not retrieve. Mutual interett, the only
sure bond of peace, has hitherto prevent
ed a war between us and the kingdoms of
Europe ; shall we cut this bond asunder ?
It is laid we mav compel Britain to make
a commercial treaty with us; (he will ne
ver refufe voluntarily to make one which
may promote her interest, and could we
compel her to make cne against her inte
rest, it could not be lasting ; it mull end
in war.
We have had no fatisfa&ory evidence
that fiie is averse to a treaty. The cor
respondence between our Secretary of
State and the Britiih minister rather (hews
the contrary. I much doubt the policy
of. multiplying our commercial treaties.
A nation, which has more military strength
than resources for commerce, may compel
unequal stipulations in her favor. But
this we neither wish, nor are able to do.
We may fuffer by treaties, but can hardly
be benefited. Our strength confifls not
in ability to compel others, but in4>eing
invincible at home. If we are ever to
make treaties, let us wait until experience
shall have taught us all the commercial in
tercfts of our country. We areafcending
an eminenceâlet us firft arrive at the
summit; when we {hall have the whole
extensive profpeft before us, it will be
eaily enough to judge of the advantages
of our situation. We may now facritice
important interests which we fee not. Our
progreflion may make that a lading evil,
which we now call an advantage.
It is said we ought to resent the politi
cal injuries and insults we have received.
Is this resenting them ! If the queltion is
whether we shall retaliate hostilities, let
us have it fairly and boldly stated, that
we may consider it. Away with all mean
disguisesâstrip the question of its flimzy
covering. We surely are not afraid to
look at the fubjeft of difcuflion. We wilh
not to conceal it from others. Before we
take the lirit step, let us pause to review
our fitnation,'W consider the consequen
ces. How much have we to loÂ£e both in
pofieflion and profpeft, and how little to
gain ! Britain is aided by powerful allies,
who hate and defpifc our political fvftem.
Our former ally instead of aflifling us,
needs to be assisted. The commerce of
Britain is already interrupted by war, and
we can add little to its embarralTments.
Our commerce now flourifiling, must be
facrificed, as we have no fleet to protect
it. As to revenue, Britain has all the
advantages without the evils of bankrupt
cy. The principal of her debt will never
be paid, but her creditors are both inter
ested and able to support her. Addition
al millions are Ibft in the mass without per
ceiving the iocreafe.
To add a few millions of Dollars to our
debt would alarm both us and our condi
ments. British soldiers are enured to fo
reign warfafre. Our independent Yeomen
arc invinciblc in battle, for their rights,
their habitations, their wives and their
children; the world cannot fubjlgatc them.
but they harbor no wiflies for conquest or
plunder. If we commence tyftility, we
mull perfcvere through every extremity
of fuffering, or meanly prg (Irate ourfelvcs
at the feet of Britain, to bear whatever
(lie may please to impose.
When the welfare and dignity of our
country require energy, I fliall not be
found an advocate for a pusillanimous sys
tem. No man is more proud of his coun
try than rnyfelf. I agonize under the in
dignities (he has fuffered : But to repreis
resentment is sometimes true courage;
untimely passion, which may betray the
rights and dignity of the community, is
perfidious. Our growth is so rapid, that
a few years of peace will avenge us. 1
have made these observations Sir, not be
cause I am the friend of Britain, but be
cause a sense of duty compelled me. If
I have prejudices refpe&ing European na
tions, they are not in favor of Britain. I
hesitate not to avow that the}' are in favor
of the people with which fne is at war. I
can never forget, that probably by them,
we exist as a Nation. I can never forget
the noble energy with which they com
menced their Itruggle to rescue this coun
try from bondage. It is the place of my
fathers' sepulchresâno man more ardent
ly wiflies them liberty and happiness, but
justice obliges me to add, that no one
more fincertly laments that spasm of pa
tnotifm, which convulses their body poli
tic, and hazards the cause of freemen :
But Sir, we ought not to fuffer a torrent
of feeling to sweep us from our pollâwe
are neither Britons nor Frenchmenâwe
are Americansâthe Representatives of
Americansâthe Guardians of their rights
and interests ; and these forbid us to pass
the Resolutions now under consideration.
(Debate to be continued.)
For the Gazette of the Ukitsd States'
AT numberless meetings throughont
tlie United States, for taking into con
fidevation the Resolves of the Democra
tic Society of PhiladelphiaâGenuine Pa
triotism in the chair : The following re
folulions were unanimously adopted.
I ft. Resolved, That it is one of the una
lienable Rights of Freemen to dijenfs -with
freedom and firmnefs all fubjecls of public
concern: That in consequence of thiP
principle, these meetings have an indispu
table right to offer their sentiments con
cerniog the Democratic Society and its se
veral resolutions.
2d. Resolved, That the high profef
iionsof difmterefted patriotism held out
by the Democratic Society, are very
equivocal proofs of its public virtue ; and
that these are best discovered in the refo
tions which it has published.
3d. Rejoined, That it is extremely im
politic, as well as ungenerous, for any Citi
zens of America, publickly to pour
foith illiberal abuse against foreign pow
ers with whom we are at peaceâmerely,
because they are enemies to France : We
fay impolitic, because powerful nations
may thereby be irritated to attack us, to
whom we are by no means equal, either
in population or military preparations:
We fay ungenerous, because some of these
nations were our friends in the most try
ing days of our difficulties and distress.
4th. Rcfolvcd, That the public faith
being equally pledged to preserve peace
with Great-Britain as well as with France,
all persons or societies, who dire Sly or in
direSly, (hall endeavor to bully or trick our
country into a war with either, must in
tend a violation of our national honor,
and must therefore, be considered as ene
mies to America.
Jth. Resolved, That the determination
expressed by the Democratic Society, to
abide by our national engagements and pre
serve national friend/hips, when contrasted
with its insults against friendly nations, is
as flagrant an instance of its inconliften
cy, as the infinnation of punic faith against
our illullrious President, is a convincing
proof of its impudence and presumption.
6th. Resolved, That the conduct of
the French Republic in seizing our ves
sels, laden with provisions for the coun
tries, with which (he is at war, is as dar
ing fin infringement of the eflabfijhed law of
nations, as any that we have experienced
from other powers. Nay, this conduct
is peculiarly aggravating, as it is express
ly ftipulatt'd between France and, by trea
ty, that the vessels of the latter, thus la
den, (hall pass free and unmoleftcd.
7 th. Ri/ohed, That the outr.iges of
fered to our trade, or citizens, by Gieat
Britain, will probably be relented in a
much more proper manner, and redrefj
much more easily obtained by the spirited
conduit of our National Congrels, and
the long tried wisdom of our beloved
President, than by the fug
gellions, and noily declamations oi any
obfeure Society wifuing to bawl itlelf in-
to political consequence.
Bth. R'fohea, That the trade of A
merica has greatly contributed to her
prosperity and credit, and that tlus
having been greater with G'.'eat-Brritain
and her colonies, than with all the reft of
Europe togetherâits interruption at this
time, would overwhelm the agricultural
and mercantile inteielt in unfpeakubW
dillrefs. Neither could its loss, in any
proportion be supplied, by any commer
cial privileges in trading with colonies
overrun with banditti, and desolated by
incendiaries.
oth. Rrfohcd, That however Foreign
Minister* may be juflined, in adhetiug
flrictly to the inftru&ions of their own
Sovereigns, yet tliefe inftru&jnns are by
no means binding on the nation, to which
they arc sent; neither is any Miniiter au
thorized on that account, to affiont the
Government to which he is delegated, or
to look for countenance from the real
Friends of that Government.
I oth. Rejoined, That every Govern
ment has a natural right to interpret Us
own treatiesâthat we rely implicitly, on
the honor and abilities of our Executive to
do soâand that the fenfeof thcie United
States refpc cling our treaty with France,
has been abundantly collected and evinced,
not only by addrefles and resolves from
every quarter of the but also by
the unanimous declaration of Coogrefs.
11 th. Refohcd, That Imperium in Im
perio, or one sovereign authority within
another, is a fatal fulecifm in politics, and
incompatible with Liberty: We there
fore deem any particular Democratic So
ciety, rising in the midft.of our great De
mocratic Government, and presuming to
dictate to its conflituted authorities,
fraught'with the deftruftive materials of
anarchy, inimical to law and order, and
highly iufulting to the great body of the
people, who confiding in the wisdom and
virtue of their ovm delegates,
the advice nor interference ot felf-confti-
tuted societies.
12th. Rcfolvcd, That we are united in
the bonds of Civil Society, to resist with
equal vigilance the encroachments of Anar
chy, as well as of Despotismâthat the
name of Liberty, without its blessings is a
delusive phantomâand that the grcateft
of these blessings are Security and Peace :
That the Despotism of a Mob, is as
tremendous an evil as that of a Monarch :
That to countenance either, is to incur
the execration of Mankindâand that
they, who wilfully plunge a Nation, hap
py as this is, in discord and bloodthed, ge
nerally give birth to one or the other of
these calamities.

From the New-York Daily Gazette,
MR. M'lean,
I read in an European Magazine as follows
" THE Quakers' Letter of this year,
instills some of the noblest principles of
Morality. That passage which inculcates
paying our full debts as loon as wears
able, (notwithstanding any composition
which creditors may accept of) ought to
be written in legible Letters, and presented
to every Bankrupt with his Certificate.â
It is the opinion of many honeH and judi
cious persons, that if a Law were enaited,
prohibiting every Jpedes of Luxury to such
as have been in a jlate of Bankruptcy, till
they had paid twenty (hillings in the pound,
it would be attended with excellent conse
quencesâVanity would prompt many to
this laudable conduct, in whose breail nei
ther Honor nor Houefty finds a place.
These Luxuries might be fpeciticdâfuch

NATIONAL CONVENTION,
November 1.
Some citizens from the department of
Nievre, headed by the republican Chau
mette, procurator of the commons of Pa
ris, brought the result of their searches
in that department ; they produced a real
treasure, confiding of 17 boxes full of
gold and silver, both specie and plate, ayd
amounting to several millions.
The three citizens who came firft in,
bore two crofles, and a large croft enam
elled with vermillion.
The fourth brought a fun of gold,fur
mounted with a cap of liberty.
The fifth citizen brought in his hand a
gilt ducal coronet of filvcr. A member
demanded, and the ferjeants of the hall
were ordered to stamp upon it with their
feet. One of the ferjeants immediately
made it burst in pieces, by stamping up
on it ; upon which the convention and the
fpeftators all exclaimed, Vive la Repub
lic !
Louis demanded, that the large gdn
dolas or royal yatchs, and the state coach
es of the late court, be broke in pieces,
and fold.
Serjeant answered, that all tins was
now doing ; and that the commiflioners
entrusted with the sale of the royal effects,
had already disposed of the hearse in which
the corpse of the tyrants afed to be con
veyed to St. Dennis. âOrder of the day.

VOLUME X OF
Encyclopedia; or Dictionary
Of Arts, Sciences, and Miscellaneous
Literature, on a Plan entirely new ;
BY WHICH
The Different Sciences and Arts,
are digejted into the form cf
Diftinft Treaties or Systems :
THIS volume contains principles of Levels*
Liberty, Do&rine of Light, Lightning,

Madaga'fcar, MaÂ£ic, Magnetism, Malt?, His

nics, with a great variety of Biographical and
Miscellaneous articles, illuitrated with Twen-

As a number ot families are still in the
country, and it is not generally known who
arereturned. T. Dobfon, solicits the favor
of the fubferibers to call or fend for tfteir vo
lumes, that they may be supplied as early as
ponihle.
The t*Nth volume of the Encyclopedia is
now preF<nted to the public ; but as it makes
its appearance in an imnctfeCl state, iome ac
count of the reason of rhVt i'mperfeftlon fliould
he oiven. On the Brh cf September last, tl>e
Pviblifher had the misfortune of having his
Printing Office burnt down by a lire which
broke out in the neighbourhood, and a great
quantity of his printing materials destroyed,
and among other articles, the FrouiEs, with,
which he was printing the tables op
o arithm s, belonging to the pre Sent
were incited down by the violence of the lire,
i As a supply of these could not be immediately
I obtained, he was under the neccffity of pub
! lifliing the volnme without the r e tables; but
1 hopes he Ihall be able topublilh them with the
next volume which is now in considerable for-
wardnefs.
The Publiflier embraces this opportunity of
exprefiing his grateful acknowledgments to
the generous public, for the very liberal pa
tronage with which his undertaking has been
honored; at the fame time he takes the li
berty of representing to fiich of the fubferibers
as are ita arrears, the indifpenfible neceflity of
pun&uality, both in taking: up the volumes as
early as pofliWe after publication, and oi pay
ing for them when taken. Many of the sub
scribers having got only one, two, three, Â£rc.
volumes, and several volumes remain php a-id.
Thus the work hangs in all its different stages
from the commencement; and though the im
portance of a few dollars may be but a trifle
to the individuals, yet the accumulation of
these trifles "unpaid lays the Publiflier under
very fei ious enibarraifment, and deprives Wm
of the use of many ThoufandsÂ«f Dollars which
at this time would be of very eflential service.
For tbefe reasons the Publi(her finds himfelf
under the necessity of recurring to the original
terms of publication, and in fiirure no vo
lumes will be delivered but only to thoie wli#
take and pay to the time of publication.
