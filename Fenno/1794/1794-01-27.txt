DECLARATION
6f the Grand Master of the Sovereign
Order of Malta, to the court of Na
. pies, dated Sept. 38, 1793.
/ THE Court of Naples having caused
to be notified to the Grand Master of the
Sovereign Otder of Milta, that not will
ing to have any thing further to do with
those who at present govern France,it sent
away all the agents of that country, who
had hitherto relided at Naples, or at the
parts of his Sicilian Majeily, his Eminent
faighnefs took the earliest opportunity of
fyHowing' that example, and of ordering
the ports of Malta to be {hut agninft all
kinds of French (hips of war or privateers
as long as the present war (hall continue.
â¢ The Grand Mailer wishes to make
known at the fame time, that (5 nee the no
tification which the late king mr.de to him
erf the acceptance of the constitution of
1791, the government of Malta has had
no relation with France. The dreadful
troubles which have broke out in that
kingdom, and which have deprived it of #
Sovereign universally regretted, and the
violation of the rights of nations, which
have been permitted there under every
point of view, in regard to the Sovereign
Order of Malta, have induced many per
sons", not acquainted with the fundamen
tal laws of this order, to think that re
prisals ought to have Seen made ; but
these laws even prescribe neutrality in all
those quarrels which arise between the dif
ferent Chriuian nations. The .Grand
Master, however, fully determined not to
acknowledge the pretended French R. in
the person of an agent which it might
fend to Malta, ordered, on the 15th of
March lad, the Chevalier de Sevtrcs de
Caurnont, in his quality of member of the
order and of its delegate, who had resid
ed long in this island as charge d' Affaires
of the King of France, to retain the title
which he held from his Majesty Louis
XVI. of glorious memory, and to keep
the arms of the king over his fate, which
he has hitherto done, under protection
of the government of Malta. â¢
But (he Grand Master learning through
an indirect channel, that a person named
Aymar has been appointed to fuceeed the
Chevalier de Caumont, and that he is now
on his way to Malta,' formally declares at
present that he will neither receive nor ad
mit the said personage, norany other who
may be fer.t to ref;de at Malta, as agent
in any refpeft, of the said pretended Re
public, which his Eminent Highness
ought not, cannot, and will not acknow
ledge,
A gentleman lately arrived from Pan's,
and who had been several times in compa
ny with' "f. Paine the Outlaw, declares
that he is in daily expectation of termina
ting his Career by the guillotine, to which
he has made up his mind. His voting to
fend Lpuis XVI. to America, is the cause
assigned, which renders him a fufpiciou:
charaftir there.
When the verdiA was pronounced up
on, BrifTot and the Deputies, they requeu
ed leave to. speak themselves, or to be heard
by their defenders. As it was believed,
that this requefl was made with a view of
delaying the sentence, and as the accused
had already been heard, the Tribunal re
fufed to accede to it.
Sillery was the firft who fuffered by the
fatal engine. Several, addieifed the peo
ple, particularly Briffot.
The execution, of each of the Deputies
was announced by a discharge of eight
pieces,of cannon placed on the road to
Chr.illon.
BrifTot was the last of the Deputies who
were executed.
"the French are breaking up the graves
in all the churches, in order to make even
the'dead contribute to tlfe expencee of the

When our letters came away from I
Frankfort, there was a report of a pitched
battle having been fought, near Stras
bourg, between the Auftrians under Ge
neral Wurmfer and the French Army.
This report adds, that the French wot
defeated with immense (laughter, and se
veral thousands of them taken prisoners.
S:ia(bourg is said to have opened its
gates to the Allies immediately after this
defeat, we (hould be glad to hear those
reports however probable they are, offici
. ally confirmed. ,
A detachment from Lord Hootrs

November 14.
To the Sitting of the 29th. the Jaco
bins of Paris presented a petition to the
Convention, requesting that Trials be ter
minated whenever the Jury (hould declare
themselves fatisfied with any part of the
evidence brought forward. The Conven
tion granted this requcft, which was also
backed by the President of the Revolu
tionary Tribunal. The Jacobins solicited
this Decree, from an left
Briffot and his Accomplices (hould enter
into too long a defence, and, by the pow
er of their eloquence, makÂ« an impression
upon the Judges.'
In the Sitting of the 31ft, the Con*
vention learned from their Coinmiffionefs,
that 500 men were employed in razing
the fortifications of Lyons.
In the fame Sitting it was decreed, that
the women (hould no longer be permitted
to aflemble in Clubs.
The Prince of Saxe Cobourg is one of
the most extraordinary, as well as one of
the greatef! characters of the age. To
great profundity of thought, he unites
the ntmoft cheerfulnefs and hilarity of
manners. Being middle-age, (hort, and.
inclined to corpulency, he has a jolly ap
pearance, heightened by a "Habit of laugh
ter, which he indulges inceflantly. He
is remarkably fond of drawing : but does
not confine himfelf to plans of sieges of
battle. On the morning of his firft en-,
gagement with Dumourier, Clairfayt ha
ving paid this General a visit, is said.to
have found him diverting himfelf with
(ketching a caricature, of which Clairfayt
himfelf was the fubjeft. To have (elect
ed such a time for such an employment 1
roust have appeared strange ; but the
Prince had previously arranged the neces
sary dispositions for ensuring his success.
LAST MOMENTS of the LATE
QUEEN of FRANCE.
When (he heard her fenter.ee read, (he
did not (hew the smallest alteration in her
countenance, and left the Hall without
fayiilg a (Ingle word to the judges or to
the people. It was then half past four in
the morning, Oft. 16. The Queen was
conducted to the condemned hold in the
prison of the Conciergerie.
At 5 o'clock the Generale wa9 beat.â
At 7, the whole armed force was on foot;
cannon were planted on the squares, and
at the extremities of the bridges, from
the Palace to the Square de la Revolution
âAt ten o'clock numerous patroles passed
thro' the streets.
At half pad 11 in the morning, Marie
Antoinette was brought out of the prison,
dressed in a white dishabille. Like other
malcfaftor6,(he was conducted upon a com
mon cart to the place of execution.
Her beautiful hair from behind was en
tirely cut off, and her hands were tied be
hind her back. Besides her di(habille,(he
wore a very small white cap. Her back
was turned to the horse's tail.
During her trial flie wore a dress of a
white and black mixture.
On her right, upon the cart, was fcnt
ed the executioner ; upon the left a con
stitutional priest belonging to the Metro
politan Church of Notre Dame, drefled
in a grey coat, and wearing what is com
monly called a bob wig. The cart was
escorted by numerous detachments of horse
and foot. Henriot, Rouflin, and Bou
langer, generals of the Revolutionary ar
my, preceded by the reft of the ftaff offi
cers, rode before the cart.
An immense mob, especially women,
crowded the streets, insulting th,C Queen,
and vociferating " Long live the Repub
lic!" She seldom cast her eyes upon the
populace, and babeld with a cold iudiffe
rence the great armed force of 39,000
men, which lined the streets iri double
ranks., ,
, The fufferings which (he sustained dur
ing hdr captivity had much altered her ap
peal ance, and the hiir on her forehead ap
peared as white as snow.
The Queen, without anguiih or bigo
try, was ipeaking to the Prielt seated by
her fide. . Her spirits were neither eleva
ted nor depreffed;â(he fcemed quite i
sensible to the fliouts of " Vive la Repub
lique !" She even (hewed a kind of fatis
fa&ion in looking for the moment which
might rid her of her miserable existence;.
When she passed through the street
called Rue St. Honore, (he sometimes at
tentively looked at che iufcriptions of the
wi>rds LIBERTY and EQUALITY,
affiled to theoutiide of the houses.
She ascended the fcaffold with seeming
haste and impatience, and then turned her
eyes with great emotion towards the gar
den of the Thuilleries, the former abode
of her greatness.
At half past twelve o'clock the guillo
tine fevered her head from her body. She
died in the 38th year of her age.
The executioner lifted and (hewed the
blood-streaming head from the fouv differ
ent corners of the fcaffold, which is (hewn
only from one fide in all other common ex
ecutions. The mob instantly vociferated,
" Long live the Republic I''
A young man who dipped his pocket
handkerchief in the Queen's blood, and
pressed it with veneration to his breast,
was instantly apprehended. Upon him
were found the portraits of Louis XVI.'
and Marie Antoinette.
The corpse of the ill-fated Queen was
immediately after buried in a grave filled
with quick lime, in the cliurch-yatd cai'led
de la Madelaine, where Louis XVI. was
buried in the fame manner.

" Gentlemen,
" 1 have this instant deceived the news
of the horrid outrage which has'terminat
ed the days of the Queen, my fiftcr-in
law. The grief and indignation which
if excites in me, can be allayed only by the
concern you take in it. True Frenchmen
and faithful fubjefts, we ought in a two
fold degree to feel the horror of thjs crime
It is by redoubling our zeal-for the ser
vice of our young and unfortunate King,
that we can one day render fucli losses less
grievous, and efface the (lain which mon
gers would imprint on the French name.
Such 1 am well convinced, are the senti

which my brother and I will prtferve till

SITTINGS OF the JACOBINS.
O&ober ji. t
"Dubois Cranee asserted, that a force of
such magnitude as 60,000 men was not
wanted to reduce Toulon. Twenty thou
sand men, vvith a large train of artillery,
would be fufficient to produce this effect.
One hundred and thirty pieces of artil
lery were on their way from Lyons to the
army before Toulon. " With 20,000
jnen, and this fitpply of cannon," exclaim
ed Dubois Crance, " I will answer for
the reduction of Toulon."

A letter from Perpignan was read. Ey
this it appeared, that 30,000 men, eager
to fight the Spaniards, were encamped
under the walls of Pcrpignan ; that the

vious to the arrival of official dispatches
avowing vwr neutrality, an idea was a

and pol't'cs, that you would embrace the
cause of France, and declare agaiiijl their
enemies. In confeqneiiee of this, and
some iadirefet communications, a cabinet
council was furnmoned, and measures hos
tile to out peaceable intercouffe resolved
on. It is said that a meflage to this pur
part was sent to Mr. Pinckney, who wait
ed on the miniver, remonstrated against
any precipitate determinations, and de
manded a delay of a few days, or till the re
ceplion of expected dispatches iihould ena

A velfel speedily irrived it one of the out

means of reletting both nations from an

'0 ;r own hemisphere is very barren of

ever, must not be omitted.âThe French
Minister has written a letter to the Presi

country. This letter the President has
laid hofere Congress.
This letter unfolds the plan of Mr. Ge
f.ctâlt seems an expedition against the
Spaiiifh Settlements was intended, and .a
f.>rce for this purpose has been raising in
South-Carolina, under commissions from
Mr. Genet. This plan was kept as secret
us* podible, but being detested, its pro
gress is happily checked. A febeme of
this kind would have been attended with
one of these confequirices. âEithdr Spiin
would have immediately declared vtar a

scheme was not countenanced by govcrn

demnification for all the miichief and lois
which thefs expatriated renegadoes might
â¢have done to her territory. This, (he
would have had a right to receive ; so that
the scheme,. if it had not involved us in a
war, would have colt us, perhaps millions
of money-.
It is with pleasure we learn, that foreign

The tenth tolum* of the Encyclopedia iJ
now presented to the public ; but as it make!
its appearance in an impcrfeft slate, some ac
count of the reason of that imperfection <hould
be given. On the Bth of September last, the
Publilher had the misfortune of having bis
Printing Office burnt down by a fire which
broke out in the neighbourhood, and a great
quantity of his printing materials destroyed,
and among other articles, the rieulit, with
which he was printing the tables or lo
garithms, belonging to the present volume,
were melted doWn by the violence of the Ere.
As a supply of tbefe could not be immediately
? obtained, hfc was under the neceflity of pub
tilhing the volume without the r e tables; but
hopes he fflall be able topublilh them with the
next volume which is now in confidcrable ior-
wardnefs. -
The Publisher embraces this opportunity o*
exprefling bis grateful acknowledgments to
the generous public, for the very liberal pa
tronage with which his undertaking has been
honored; at the fame time he takÂ« the li
bsrty of reprefentui& to such ol the fubfcriberi
a; are in arrears, the indiipenfible necellity ot
punctuality, both in taking up the volumes a*
early as polfib'.e after publication, ana of pay
fog for them when taken. Many of the ftib
fcribers having got only one, two, three, ?.'c
volumes, and t'everal volumes remain vkpaio*-
Thus the work hangs in all its different Images
from the commen*emÂ«nt j and though rhe im
portance of a few dollars may be bur a trifle
! ,o the individuals, yet the ascumulation of
these trifles unpaid lavs the Publifr.er under
very serious embarrÂ»ffmeM t and deprives him
of the life of many Thoulands of Dollars which
at this time would be of very essential ferric*.
For these reasons the Publiflier finds liimfelf
under the necsflity of recurring to the origin**
terms of publication, and in future no Vo
lumes will be delivered but only to those whÂ»-
take and pay to the time of publication.
