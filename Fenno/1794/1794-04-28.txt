[BY REQUEST.]
From the General Advertiser.
Mr. Bache,
I take the liberty of requesting you to
publish the following reply to a cruel and
calumniating charge against me, which
appeared in Mr. Oswalds paper of the 23d
instant, and which may be equally appli
cable to the authors of twoljmilar pieces,
whjch have been published in your gazette.
I will not descend to answer in detail, the
illiberal infinuatipns contained in them,
not doubting tljat the extract given, will
fully refute the felfe and ungenerous
charge. J. A.
Mr. Oswald,
The unfounded and illiberal attack
made upon me in your paper of the 23d
instant by an anonymous corrtfpondent,
who signs himfelf "one of the laity,"
obliges me from a regard to truth, as .well
as from a sincere desire to preserve the
character of an inoffenfive citizen, to con
tradict his assertions with refpeft to my
sermon preached on Easter day. This I
â cannot more effectually do, than by trans
cribing that part of it which he alludes to,
and which he call "an unprovoked attack
upon a great and magnanimous people,
not warrantable on the score of policy,or
even of common civility."
I afTure you upon my honor, that the
f illowing extract contains the -whole of
ti)e only pait of the sermon, which it can
poflibly be supposed the layman refers to,
and is verbatim as I delivered it from the
pulpit. The occasion naturally led me
to insist upon the great chriitian doctrines
of the reftirreCtion and a future itate of
existence, which having endeavored to e
lucidate, 1 enforced with this recommen
dation :
" Let then the expectation of this eter
nal life, excite our daily preparations for
it. Let the employments of our future
jlate be the principal iubjeCt of our con
templation in the prefentr; and whether
prosperity or Sdverfity be our lot in
life, let us run with patience the race -which
it set before us ; locking unto Jesus, the au
thor and finijher of our faith who hath de
livered us from the dread of annihilation,
and given us the assurance of an everlast
ing existence.
" Let us put on the whole armour of
God, and resolutely (land as christian sol
diers, in the breach which the insolence of
Deism, and the iniVious delusions of a falfe
philosophy, have lately made in the walls
of the sanCtuary ; let usv'g Inntly guardja
gainft the introduction of that {hocking
tenet, which is jiow, alas ! the fafliionable
though fatal doCtrine in a nation, who
once gloried in the name of christians, scut
who having extinguished the light of the
blefied gospel, in mercy given to "conduCt
them to ever lasting bliss, now grope in
the dark, and madly conceive that the ac
tions of the present life, shall at its dose,
be forgotten in an everl i.Hng fle-p.
"To be no moreâfad cure! For who
would lpfe
This intellectual Being,
Those thoughtÃ which wander thro' eter
nity,
To pe ifh rather, swallowed up and loft
In the wide womb of uncreated night,
Devoid of sense and motion ?â
Milton's P. L. B- 2. L. 146.
Dreadful delusion 1 which that we may a
void, let us eagerly avail ourselves of all
those means of grace, which the benevo
lence of Providence hath granted us, to
Hrengthen and confirm our faith, and
thereby to conduit us into the kingdom
of Heaven."
How far the charge against me is
founded on the above extraCt, I leave the
candid to deteimine.
" This son of the cassock, fays the au
thor, told us, that the French had re
nounced their allegiance to the Supreme
Ruler of the Universeâthat Satan had
, ercCted his standard in that country âand
that the whole nation I>s4 Cnlifted under
tiis banner."\
To praft'ee meakr.efs, forbearance
id charity, fays the Layman, istHtf duty
â¢f-all uankind, and particularly belongs
to those persons, who call therrffelves the
servants of God, and the successors of the
Apostles."
This is certainly true, and it is also
true, that it is the duty of a Christian
Minister, to warn the people whom he
addresses, against the introduction of all
such principles, as would inevitably sub
vert not only their temporal, but Eter
nal happiness.

Wevilgaam, Jannary 20. ,
WE took this poiition'a few days since,
in consequence of some movements made
,by the enenÂ»y, to attack Menin and
Contrary. âThis village is situated be
tween thdfe towfis nearly an equal dill a ace
from each ; .and we can instantly assist ei
ther in Cafe of an attack, an event we
hourly look for. Four regiments of ca
valry from Ghent are stationed here, with
some infantry of the 14th; the 34th' And
53d" are to take this duty next Month.
Notwitftnnding the proximity of this
place with the French Frontiers and that
the inhabitants have been twice plundered
the are engaged with as much
zeal in their agricultural avocations as the
' hufbandmeri in England who sow with the
conviction of reaping also. The village
is charmingly lituated, and the adjacent
country richly cultivated.
A. few days ago, an Austrian piquet of
20 men, with two or three Britilh light
dragoons, which had advanced too far into
French Flanders, without leaving centi
nels behind them, were surrounded by a
party of the Carmagnols ; a smart action
ensued, but terminated in favour of the
enemy ; some were killed, and the Survi
vors were made prisoners.

LONDON, March I.
HAUT TON.
On Saturday morning, in consequence
of the necessary official documents from
the Right Reverend Father in God, the
Bishop of London, to the Dean of the
Arches, a suit was instituted in Doctors
Commons, at the instance of the King.
This suit is to set aside a marriage
which has for some months occupied much
of the female conversation in the upper
circles. It is that of Prince Augustus
Frederick with a Lady Elizabeth M y,
which about ten months ago, took place
in Italy. It is also rumoured, that this
curious affair will be followed by another
equally novel, in which a young gentle
man nearly allied to his Royal Highness
is implicated.
The proceedings are founded on the
ast which was pafled subsequent to the
marriage of the Dukes of Gloucester and
Cumberland, for the purpose of prevent
ing in future the Blood Royal from be
ing prophaned by mingling with that of
the Swinish Multitude.
Lady E. M y came from Leghorn,
we hear, in one of the lalt veflels from
thence. On the arrival of the (hijt on the
coafl of England, {he wrote to Lord
Grenville, stating her marriage, and re
queuing to be extmpt from the usual form
of quarantine, being far advanced in her
pregnancy. Her request being instantly
complied with, her Ladyftiip hastened to
town, and was a second time condu&ed
to the Altar, where the sacred ccremony
was a second time performed.
The Duke of Montrofe bantering Mr.
Pitt, on his intended tax on carriages and
horses, at Lord Chancellor's late feaft,
observed, " Do what you will, Pitt, his
Majelty and myfelf will drive more car T
riagcs and horses free of expence, than
any other two persons in England,"â
" Aye," replied the Heaven-born Minis
ter, (looking at the Duke of Portland and
Mr. Powis) " that; you might do, but 1

APRIL 28.
A eonefpondtnt fays, the letter from
t}ie American Captains at Bourdeaux, to
their deputies at Paris, exhibits an affect
ing recital of the diftrefles of a large num
ber of American Citizensâhe queries
whether the humanity and justice of this
country are not pledged to make immedi
ate provision to enable those unfortunate
men to return to their own country, should
the embargo, which has plunged them in
to their present destitute situation be ta
ken off ?
Are the Clergy to be browbeaten and
calumniated for pointing out the dange
rous tendency of Atheism in a foreign
coantry ? Is it not their duty to guard
against the corruption of morals and the
prostration of all religious principles, by
exhorting their congregations to prefevere
in the ways of truth and virtue ? The
Clergy may err, it is admitted.âlt may
j be that what France is doing, is to encou
rage religious faith, and the practice of
virtueâBut they mult preach as they be
lieve, unless like the Paragraphift in the
General Advertiser, they make the truth
a matter of indifference as.many exam
ples, and one recent one, have (hewn.â
Go on, Gentlemen of the Clergy, you
have the refpeft of a Public, not yet as
deeply corrupted as your Calumniators.

As the Tragedy of Hamlet is "e> be repeat
ed, an Obferi er would suggest the correc
tion of several small oversights; errors which
appear trifling at firft, are often of great
confequtnce. "Was not the character oi Po
lonius particularly defective ? Mr. Morris
is in general an excellent performer, yet here
he certainly over a<fied his part: Polonii.s

ated old man, Ihould never excite the laugh

when he s killed.
In the firft a<3, the centinels were not per
fect in their partsâThe cock did not crow,

did not in time, on the proposal of the Â»
oath âThe elegant soliloquy of the VlinyW
was omitted, and the larger part of the
Player King's fpeechâOfrick's dress was
too finical, and his part over a (fled. Mr.
F{nnel did not perhaps express fufficient
surprize, on learning Ophelia's death, and
the bowls of wine and the rapiers would
have been more properly arranged on a table,
These things if corrected, will render the
exhibition much - more pleasing: But when
we set th'.m aside, and consider the perform
ance of Mr. Fennel and Mrs. Marlhall, v.';
mult pronounce it superior to any thing yet
exhibited.
Mrs. Marshall had exhibited before, so
well, that all further 'improvement was sup
posed to be precluded,.but her appearance in
Ophelia beggars all praise.
A Cerrefpondent Sayj,
Whether it is incumbent on the officers
the police of this city, to take some ef
fc&nal measures to guard the lives ana limbs
of the citizens, old and ycung, from the
dangers and accidents to which they are
exposed, and from which they very fre
quently fuffer, thro' the carelelmefs of dray
men, carmen, waggoners, coachmen and
others, who drive carriages thro* our streets
in an unlawful manner, the fad experience
of many leaves no room to doubt. Two or
three very melancholy instances have occured
jn the course of the lait week, of children
being run over, and lhockingly bruisedâ
some have been so 1 adly injured, that their
lives are almost despaired of. A perlon can
scarcely walk the streets without witnessing
the most wanton deportment on the part of
i'ervants and others, who gallop thro' the
streets and turn corners with such rapidity as
to hazard the lives of foot paflengers, who
cannot be apprized of their danger, till mif
chief overtakes them; surely these things
ought not to be.

Proclamation of the Citizen Piehegru,
General, Commander in Chief of the
Army of the North, to his Fellow-
Soldiers.
Comrades !
IN accepting the command of the Ar
my I iely lets on my own talents than on
your courage and the fpuit of Liberty
which presides over our arms. We have
purged the fun of republicanism of thole
spots with which its fuvface was polluted
1 by the united bands of titled villains.â
Our brave republicans have seen their ene
mies fly, before them, and . there remains
but a f.natl portion 0} our territory taint
ed by their machinations, but by the ex
ertion of our united efforts we must loon
accomplish their total ruin. We fight for
freedom, and I flatter myfelf we will not
fight in vain. - Yet a mutual confidence is
necessary to infuieour successâa volunta
ry union of talents and inclination. E
very man must redouble his efforts to aug
ment our means. You, brave veterans
who have been lignalized in battle, give
to our young foldieis all necessary inltruc
tion, that they may soon follow you to
the field of glory ! Let the recital of
your anions inftiil in their minds to an ea
ger delirc toimitateyourcondufl. Ailume
no superiority but that to which dangers
have entitled you, and which dangers
tney are willing to divide.
And you, young citizens, who aie cal
led upon to defend your country, show
youilelves zealous of laudable inftruÂ£b*on,
that you may be enabled to fulfil your
glorious task. Be all friends of order and
necessary subordination, without which
'tis impofiible to succeed. What talents
1 possess shall be devoted to your service ;
but I am a frank Republican, if you do
not proceed well I will tell you iof and
recall you to order. If I should happen
to devidie from the line 1 eaineftly invite
you to copy my example. I (hall always
regard your councils as teftirfionieff of
friendfhip, and you will discover the pu
rity of my intentions by my ctonftant afii
duity. Let us all pursue the fame path
and we must lucceed.âFive la Repubhque.

FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE.
GHENT, February 18.
There are various reports relative to our
plan of cperations, but that " which carries
with it tnoft probability is, that the Britilh,
Dutch, and Hanoverians, with 12 or 14,000
Auftrians, under the command of the Duke
of York, will, guard the frontiers of W-ft
Flanders; while the Imperial army, under
Prince Cobourg, will recommence its opera
tions against Bouchain, where it is under
llood the principal army of the enemy is
polted.
PARIS, February 16.
The Revolutionary Tribunal has condem
ned to transportation for life, seven Nuns,
for having concealed in their houses some
non-juring Priests, and refufed themselves
to take the oath to liberty.
The French have entirely evacuated the
Duchy of Deux Fonts, and have dtfifted
roni eroding batteries at Pirmafens: they
it every point indicate a disposition to retreat.
By the Corunna mails, two of which have
arrived together, Intelligence is said to have
been brought, that diredtly contradicts a late
itatem-nt published in France, of a victory
having been obtained by the Conventional
troops 011 ;he fide of the Pyreilnees ; we do
not, however, learn, that Perpigr.an i 3 takeu
by the Spaniards, as lately reported in the
Italian prints.
A great number of Very promising young
officers, have lacely fold out of the armyâ
This bespeaks an approaching campaign of
danger!
In the course of the present war, from
February I, 1793, till February 1, 1794, a
writer, who we believe is accurate, stales the
captures from the French by the Britilh, ac
cording to Lloyd's books, to be 253 j of
which feventy-five were private ?rs, four fri
gates, and three Hoop?. To these mult be
added fifty-two more taken under pretended
neutral colourc, having French property on
board i and forty-five superior Ihips Â»f war
taken or destroyed at Toulon, totai 319, of
which one hundred and twcnty-il-ven were
fhiys of war ; and 202 trailing vessels. On
the other fide, the captures by the French
from the Britilh have amounted to -5^2. â
Of these, ten were privateers, a.id two tri
gates; so that the balance of ips of war,
amounts to the vait number of 115 n favor
of Great Britain. That the balance of mer
chant Ihips taken should be against us to the
number of 118, ought not "to lurprize us,
when we consider the great and universal
extent of the commerce of Great Britain,
compared with that of France, according to
which proportion only can a fair estimate be
made.
A letter from Leghorn, dated January 30,
fays, ' On the 15th inft. a desperate action
took place off the height of Porto Vecchio,
between three Sardinian vessels and two Bar
bary zebecks. The Sardinians grappled and
took one of 18 guns and 100 men, and also
grappled and boarded the other of 12 guns
and 96 men ; but some of the crew, rather
than yield, set fire to her, and she blew up,
but happily not before the Sardinian vessels
had disengaged th 'mfelves, and picked up
the people who had been blown up, among
whom were some Sardinians. The crews of
the Sardin an vessels were so enraged, that
they dispatched all the Turks and Algerines
whom they had taken, consisting of 92.
] The loss of the Sardinians was seven men
killed, 75 wounded.'

MH- Fknno,
It is a long time lince there has been any
Norfolk news, the fine fancies that have
amused the public for several months seem
to have grown dull of late. The roads
are very good, and surely a man might be
sent on to tell the gaping world, that there
is news, which will follow him in a few
days, which indeed is on the way, but he
oat travell d it.âlt is no less strange than
true that the messenger flies further than
the news, generally the intelligence has
been so pat, so nicely timed, that it could
not have done better if it had been be
fpr.iie and made for a customer : and yet

Query, whether a certain great body that
(hall be nameless, is not going to follow the
example of a foreign connexion : that is, to
make war,and wait to fee that it is properly
conduced. It is expe&ed however, that in

Ihe Texture of the Paper is thicker and
whiter and it takes the ink more freely than
the genuine paper.
The O. in the word Company is fma!!er
than the M. and other lefters of that wori
fa that a line extended from the top of the t >
to touch the top of the M. would extendcon!
fideiably above the range of the whole word!
In the word Un ted the letters are nan<> w "

The i and/in the word prom,fe are
parallel, the/inclining much mo're forwar *

There is no stroke to th* t inlhe word Air.'i
whereas in the genuine bills the Hoke is \tell
