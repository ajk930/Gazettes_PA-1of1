Foreigii Intelligence.
LONDON, Feb. 12
The Dutch Mail which arrived yester
day, brought no German papers, nor any
news of importanceâif we except the
details of the various difficulties which
concur to impede the preparation for the
enfurng campaign.
The present Loan amounts to more
than fifteen millions of three per cents,
and when the Navy is funded, amounting
to two millions more, the weight upon
the market will be equal to eighteen mil
lions.
. General Jourdan's arrell has not yet
been confirmed, and it is now said, that
he will command the army of the Arden
nes, which is to advance from Givet, and
General Pichegru that of the North,
Lille.
Great movements have been observed
lately among the enemy. An officer of
the firft requisition, who deserted from
them, has, however, betrayed their plan,
which was, with a very ftrorig column to
penetrate through the country of Namur
and the diltri& of Liege ; and with a fe
cund column, much stronger than the firft,
to attempt the Autlrian eantonments a
bout Tournay, and to blockade Conde,
Le and Valenciennes.
When the last accounts left Flanders, a
report prevailed (at Ghent) that a vio
lent commotion had broken out at Paris
two days before, in whicb a second butch
ery of prisoners had taken place. This
Flemish rumour is of the date of Wed
nesday last.
In confeqiience of the failure of a ca
pital house at Bruflcls, four other com
mercial hoafeÃ there, and at Ghent and
Courtray, have flopped payment.
From Brussels the letters by the Mail
of yefterdiiy fay, that the French are again
assembling in such numbers near Steen-
Toorde on the sea coast, as to seem to
threaten the whole of Weft-Flanders ; nu
merous conjectures are also formed from
their flying camps, aiid various other
movements in Picardy, Cambrefis and
Givet. One of their patroles, of 16
men, lately advanced close to Fumes, and
set fire to a brewery.
The Diet at Ratilbon has received
ftrift charge from the Imperial Commifii
on, to eonfider, without delay, upon the
mod effectual means of putting the laws
in force against such of the dates of the
Empire as have not furnilhed their full
contingent, or been otherwifedifobedient;
as well aj of the surest means of defending
the Emperor's faithful fubjeft in the pre
sent dangerous crisis. In consequence of
these alarming apprehensions, the Elector
of Cologn has set the Ruffian example of
forcing the Fathers, or other relatives of
anypeafants that may be excused from the
forced levies, to fcrve iu their room.
Yolith are forbid to go out of this territo
ry ; and such of the petty principalities
as have hitherto furnilhed their contin
gents in money, mull fend men for the
lei-vice of the nent campaign. *
A!moft all the Royalists brought from
Toulon to Leghprn are half naked, and
in a nMit deplorable state, and as an afy
lura could not be afforded to them all,
8000 were lent to Portd Ferrago.
Much expedition was on foot at Genoa
on th,- I jrh ult. all the harbour being then
nearlj blockaded up by iKe Englifti, and
an edtdi receded from the King of Naples,
forbiding any commerce with his fubjccts;
from tbik circfimitauce, and the prclfure
of the allies to force tin Itate to abandoÃ
their neutrality toward* France, it was
expt&ed thai every person capable would
be ordereÃ to take up arms.
Anf-wer of the Sin ft Republic to Lord
Robt. Fitzgera'd's Declaration.
" Your Excellency in a letter dated the
30th of Nov, thought pre per to recommend
to the serious coniidera:. n of the Helvetic
Body, lbine important oi<krvatioas on the
relative iituation of the K-public to the bel
| ligerent powers.
" These observations we have examined
with all that care and attention which is due
to thÂ® interests of our codntry, and we think
that we afford yous Excellency a proof of the
esteem which we entertain for your cl, a racier
by makiiig an open and sincere exposition of
our situation and our condud.
" However afflicting the remembrance of
those terrible events in France (which your
Excellency has brought to our recolleilion)
and the fad fate of our brethren who fuffer
ed so unfortunately may be, yet our grief
must nevertheless yield to the principles of
our constitution : these principles have rett
ed for several centuries on the relations of
peace, amity, and good neighbourhood with
all the flirrounding powers.
" The operation of these principles has
never been interrupted by foreign wars. â
A rigid and exadt neutrality was the invari
able maxiin of our ancestors, and having re
ceived it as a sacred inheritance, we have
conceived it to be our duty to abide by it in
, the present war.âAnd this conJutf has pro
duced a salutary influence, not only 0/1 our
external fafety, but on our internal peace.
Accustomed to observe scrupulously all
engagements entered into, we will neither
wander from our declared neutrality, on any
pretence whatever, nor will we listen to any
infinuat : on which might give rife to just
complaints.
" It is for us to preserve the enjoyment
of that happy and peaceful lituation to which
all our molt zealous efforts tend. We will
unite our force to repel even the slightest at
tempts that may be made to disturb our re
pose, or to undermine the foundation of it
by any deitrui'tivc principles.
" It is towards this end that our forefight
is directed by carefully guarding our frontiers,
and by endeavoring to prevent any difficulties
by a correspondence inseparable from our
local relations.
" We intreat your Excellently to allure
his Britannic Majesty of the invariable de
termination of the Helvetic body : and it is
with entire confidence we expedl, from his
good will, that following the example of his
illullrious anceflors, who at all times have
maintained the independency of the Helvetic
Confederacy, he will continue henceforth to
entertain a fmcere affcilion for our prosperi
ty and our lepofe."
We are, &c.
BRUSSELS, February 4.
" A council of general officers, in conse
quence of the imminent filuation of things,
is now holding here. The Prince of Cobourg,
Generals Clairfiyt, Colloredo and Sechen
droff, the Duke of York, Prince Ernest Ind
General Walmoden, arrived in this city,
three days ago. The firit conference was
held on the 2d inft. at the Mmifter's Hotel,
the Count de Metternich; at which the Arch
duke Charles, Martha) de Bender, and Col.
Maek, aflifted.âlt is impoflible for me to
know what palled in this grand council, but
it is evident that its object was to concert
measures for the defence of Flanders against
the meditated torrent. The young Prince
of Orange is expedted this day, and there is
to be another grand conference to-morrow.
"We seem here to place all our hopes in
Col. Maek. He was at the theatre for the
firft time on Saturday evening : the moment
that be appeared in the Governor General's
box, the house burst out in an exclamation
of " Vive le brave Colonel Maek," " Long
live the Emperor, who has sent us back the
hero of Famars ! and on Sunday when walk
ing in the park with the veteran Generals
and the young Princes, he alone attracted all
the notice of the multitude: they prefled
around and blefied him.
" An officer of chafleurs, who in the affaii
of Thursday last came over to the Auilrians,
has given important information to the Prince
de Hoheuloe, who commands in the absence
of the Prince de Cobourg: he fays, that since
the arrival of Pichegmi, the French armies
are increased to 170,000 men; that a part of
the army of La Vendee has arrived, as well
as the garrisons of Valenciennes, Ccmde, and
Le Quei'noy j and this officer supposes that
by the 15th their artillery, horse, and amu
nition, will be arrived so as to commence
their grand scheme of attack.

NEW-YORK, April 23.
Tlr writer of a pamphlet jult pulifhed,
predicts that France will, not only defeat
the allied powers, but be able to make an
offenfive war in Europe. "HÂ« supposes the
energy of the Fiench character will be ve
ry much encreafed by the Revolution,
which, after an established government
(hall secure life and property, will amazing
ly extend the agriculture, the arts and
commerce of France. At the fame time
he describes most strikingly the deplorable
effects of Faction in that fine country,
which has drenched it in blood ; he expos
es the error# of the ruling party, and gives
salutary caution to Americans, who are
deeply interested to avoid similar factions
and prefeive union, and their excellent
constitution. This pamphlet, entitled the
" Revolution in France," is recommended
to the perusal of all good citizens.

La ft week the Latin, French and Eng
li(h Schools, in the Academy in this
Town, were publicly examined; after
which, the pupils to very refpe&able audi
ences, gave specimens of their oratorical
powers, it is but justice to mention, that
the improvements in science, and the per
formances of the (Indents, gave general fa
tiffaition; reflected much honor on their
teachers and upon themselves. It was ob
served with peculiar approbation, that those
youth who had been studying Latin and
French, were thoroughly instructed in the
principles of these languages, and that the
Fi-eoch, especially by the young ladies,
(who publicly delivered exercises in this
tongue) was spoken with gieat elegance
and propriety.
BALTIMORE, April 22.
Yeflerday arrived here in 20 days from
Jerome, the schooner Colly Capt. Deagle
âby whom we learn that an infnrreftion
took place at Port an Prince the
March, among the negroes and people of
colonr, in opposition to the whites, who
were obliged, in number 1,800 or 2,000,
to fly immediately and take refuge at
Leogane. The sailors on board the {hip
ping in the harbour, to the amount of
near 60 fail, alio fled, leaving their veffcls
with-valuable cargoes on board, at the mer
cy of the insurgents.
The party i/ho rose against the whites,
malfacred every person they could lay hands

SAVANAH, (Geo.) April 3.
To the President ojthe United States.
Sir,
THE Citizens of Savannah, ftrotigly
imprefled with the danger and mifcl.t is
to which the United States have been ex-
posed, by the poflibility of their being in
volved in the war existing between thoitf
European Nations with whom we are moit
intimately united in amity, and conneftcd
in commerce, beg leave to take this me
thod of expressing to you the iincerc and
cordial sentiments of approb; to t and ap
plause with which the meafuies you have
adopted in this very interefl-ing situation
have inspired them.
The services performed by yon, for our
common country, on so many, and fucit
various and important oceafions, in the
exercise of the higlielt civil and military
authority, were such as not to have ren
dered neceflary the public declaration of
our sentiments concerning this last in
stance of the paternal zeal with which you
have inceflantly watched over the public
happiness : But, when some of our citi
zens have spared 110 pains to inflame the
public mind, and to stimulate individuals
to adtions contrary to their duty as citi
zens, and deltruflive of the molt import
ant iiAenefts of the United States, and
when such individuals have not only been
publicly countenanced an-I encouraged by
the French Mjnilter, but that he has dar
ed to dillribute commifiions and inltru&i
011s for enlisting soldiers, in the name of
the French Republic, within thejurrfdic
tion, and without the approbation or
knowledge of our government, we think it
right thus publicly to declare, that, in
our opinion, the timely notice givep by
your proclamation of the neutrality "of
the United States, your inftruftions for
preventing the fitting out of armed velicls
in our ports, the sentiments contained 111-
your fpeechto Congress, and your mefiage
concerning the confludt of the person em
ployed in America as the Minilter of the?
French Republic, are agreeable to the
principles ps our excellent Constitution,
and;wifely calculated to ensure a continu
ance of peace, promote thÂ« public pros
perity, and preserve the dignity of the
American Nation. To the wisdom of
these measures, and the goad sense arid'
manly firmnefs of the great bulk of the
American people, it is owing that vve
have not yet experienced the horrid car
nage and devaltation of an unnece!Ta:7
war: And we rejoice that Congress have
so cordially exprelied their approbation
and concurrence iu the measures you have
adopted for the preservation of peace to
your country.
Accept, Sir, the tender of our grate
ful acknowledgements for your pail servi
ces, and the fmcei e v prci. l{ion bf thatper
fedl confidence with which such an uni
form scries of great and virtuous aÂ£liui s
have inspired us with relpedi to your fi--
ture condutt.
Signed by order of a public meet

City of Savannah, Jan. 8, 1794.
Philadelphia, 3d March, 1794.
Sir,
THE sentiments cxpreffed by the Citi
zens of Savannah are a very acceptable
addition to the testimonies cf public ap
probation already given to my late conduct
with refpeft to the Belligerent powers of
Europe.
The favorable views in which you have
placed my palt endeavors receive my u-arm
acknowledgments, and I request you to
convey them to ' the Citizens whom, on
this occasion, you represent.

To the Citizens, Members of the Congress

AFTER having laid the foundation of
cur liberty, it became incumbent on us to
fccitre it. A national government is born,
and with It vi<slory. Emanating from the
will of the people, it has their energy. For
the salvation of the ft ate it has been refcrted
to,and the Hate is saved. iAt itÂ« voice 15
armies are in motion, and triumph. At its
Cgrtal, interior order is restored âfruitful in
daftry is expandedâthe conspirators fall.
Wc impart the news of the success of our
rtnrries to a people, who, having obtain *d
lih.-rty in a ftmilar manner with ourselves,
caiinoi.leaxn ; b\,itwith eiithuliafiri.of the vi<sto
rita of republicans, & the downfall of tyrants.
Policy already appreciates the advantage
of the retaking of Toulon. Already have
the neutral povvers proclaimed themielves,
and Genoa, indignant at the atrocity of our
cAenyes, who have sullied her territory by
the vihrft and blackest of -crimes; â-Genoa
has resumed all her energy, and driven the
Engiiih. and Spaniards from her ports.
In the North, our Triumphs, not less
briHunfj have given the combined powers
feme severe fcocks.
They had dared to menace Dunkirk,
Maubeittgr, and Landau. Every where have
they bt-tn beatenâevery .where have they
bcftti put so flight;âand even towards the
Rhine, onr army' in pursuit of them had
advanced to the very gates of Mayence.
Such is the long catalogue of success which
unfolds itfclf at the moment, at every
point im which the French Republic fends
ikzr mvic<^We-phalanxes.
Sc many victories will convey nothing
aftooinilng to you ; âyou, magnanimous re
publicans, vrho will easily conceive the pro
digies which, liberty is -capable of perform
ing:, afcer having in this vast career left to
the detendero of the people memorable ex

umphs as well in thought as political union:

it 3 that of every people who honor huma-
Etfy. j
ft is under these f'o ious aulpices that the
re^refruir fives of the .French people are
prcSed by the desire of drawing closer more
tL r au the bends of friendihip, which
tf.it* twbrgrÂ£ and free nations.
Thus liberty will have two points of fix

CotafTUi, file will reft one foot on each hemis

At her voice let Agriculture and Com

IVc love the Honfe of Hanover ; but
is that a reason why we shall fight the

This day in the House of Representatives
of the United States, a bill, entitled " An
AÂ£t to suspend the importation of certain
goods, wares, and merchandize" was read
the third time and pafled. The preamble to
this adt recites the resolution publifhcd yester
day, in which the injuries fuffcred by the li
nked States from Great Britain are enume
rated, and then goes 011 to prohibit the im
portation into the United States,of any goods,
wares, or merchandize whatev r of the
growth, produce, or manufacture of Great
Britain or Ireland, from and after the firll
day of November nextâexcepting such arti
cles as are now exempted from duty. This
prohibition to cease as soon as the claims and
demands of the United States against Great
Britain, ftiall be fatisfa&orily adjustedâand
proclamation tlfereof made by the President
of the United States.
Never was there a time when falfe news
was made with more industry and impu
dence.âOne Newspaper in this city defierves
to be called the Brunei'# Gazette. Two
printers atleaft will enquire, is i: .inine ?
The lying paragraph of lafl Monday 4e
ferves some invefrigation. If a printer had
the secret of the dispatches from London, it
fhewti a leakinefs of the Cabinet'tfiat is extra
ordinary. But there is no ground for this
aspersion. If the flory was made out of the
whole cloth, and made to influence the vote
of that day, it shews, exa&ly what every
body knew before.
That Newspaper being known as the
BrufiePs Gazette, may now claim a patent
for making and vending falfe news, without
a competitor, and without injury to the pub
lic.
This country is wonderfully changed âa

Yesterday arrived here in 50 days from
the brig Liberty, Capt. Pen
fieldâwho informs us, that it was expec
ted that the embargo would soon be taken
off the American veiTels, as they had re
ceived advices from the deputation at Pa
ris, which gave them every reason for an
event so much wilhed for by the unfortu
nate Americansâthe situation of whom,
is particularly described in the letter which
follows, it having been sent to their depu
ties at Paris.
Capt. Penfield has brought 24 French
paflengers, and it was through the influ
ence of some of these paflengers, that Capt.
Penfield was permitted to fail.
From a French paper of the 21ft Fe
bruary, received by Capt. Penfield, we
learn that Ma:ftricht and Breda, were tak
en by the French.

WE have intelligence from Paris thro'
the means ef private letters from two of
our deputies, thaf you have met with con

justice in our behalf, whiclj we conceive
truly unbecoming Frenchmen, or Repub

We are fully convinced of your know

your power, to meliorate it; but circum

as well as the feelings that torture the
breasts of every American here on the re

write you, that you may be well informed
of the general wilh of us all, arid that you
may ast therefrom.
Since you left us,the reprefentants pn ap

Bourdeaux, February 24, 1794.
Citizens !
tlie demandtor Sread, wood, &e. Thus
this money in a few days vanished, and
your diflreflcd country men here were again
left didilute of the means of procui'uig
the neceflary fubfitlence for their crews-.â
Thiscaufe.in addition to the want of bread
throughout the whole fleet, the absolute
impofllbility of procuring fre ill meat on
any terms, and most of the veflels being
without fait provisions, has alarmed our
apprehensions, particularly when we can,
with difficulty, procure bread from the
publicâ"-in allowing every 12 days to each
veflel, i-2lb. bread per man per day, bis
cuit at 555. per cwt. payable in cash on
the delivery. Thus the unfortunate men
who are destitute of money, mull remain
without bread ; in (hort, it is a fail, that
moll of our veflels have not had a pound of
frefh meat on board for ten days pall, and
many of them have adlualfy used the lad
morsels of their fca provisions, which are
not to be replaced at any price, had we
monpy to do it.
This gentleman, is a (late of our fitua
tion as refpe&s fubtiftence ; we now re
quire your attention to the general fuffer
ing by daily detention in the advancement
of the fealon. We pass over the discus
sion of the Algerine risque, 'tis a theme
too well known to you, and occasions in
onr breads a pang too severe to dwell on ;
we only observe that our demand magnifi
ed ten fold, however it may appear exor
bitant, can never, if granted, atone for
the lol's of the liberty, and for the capti
vity of those who reccive it. This idea,
to a nation who declare eternal war to
tyrants, and to be the- eternal enemies oÂ£
slavery, the supporters of liberty, and
friends to freemen, ought to bias every
mercenary consideration, and .intrigue
should be driven by the common laws of
humanity ;nto the datkeft obfeurity.
A gentleman from America informs
us, that one of the firlt fleps Congress
took at the meeting, was a discussion of
the propriety of enacting a law to prevent
the importation from England, and that
a very great majority appeared to be in fa
vor of the aftâthis will have an impor
tant a fie ft on the iituation of America ;
in fiiort it is our opinion, that you ought
immediately to make a remon(trance to
the Convention, Hating your proceed
ings, the actual situation of your coun
trymen here, and on their behalf to de
mand an answer to your petition ; it is
time we fliould know our fate. Our situ
ation is tenfold more cruel than that of
prisoners of war. Our money a fid means
are exhaulted, and it is no time to prolong
an application for a final answer. We
have a right to claim itâlf it is their dis
position to render us justice, and they are
prevented by intriguing men ; it is your
duty to search for proof, and if found, to
denounce the authors of this deception.
We further direct you, to mention in
your application, that your constituents
fatigued with delay in bringing forward
their business, have desired you to demand
an answer, or passports to return in three
days. After obtainiug an issue to this,
you will use your difcrstion with refpeft
to returningâbut we trust that you will
return, and relieve us'from a further ex
pence, the moment you lose a profpeft of
bringing into effect yonr different claims.
At a meeting last eveniag, it was ob
served that the committee at Paris, had
not given us a full idea of the situation of
our claim the caigoes unfold,
and we also inform you that this letter is
not written by the committee individually,
but after a debate of a very full meeting ;
you will therefore consider this as the wilh
of the whole.
We are yours, &c.

The Firfl American Edition.
THE grand principle of Equality,if right
ly understood, is the only basis on which
universal justice, facied order, and perfctt
freedom, cin be fir-mlytbuilt, and permanent
1y secured. Tluj view of it exhibited in this
essay, at the fame time that it repress the
insolence of office, the tyranny of pride, and
the outrages of oppreftion ; confirms, in the
mod forcible manner, the neceflity of fut>or
dination, and the jult demands of fawfol au
thority. So far indeed, from loosening the
bands of society, that it maintains inviolate,
every natural and every civjl dtftin&ion,
draws more clolely every locial tie, unites in
one harmonious and justly proportioned sys
tem, antlbrings men together on the even
grouud'of the inherent rights of human na
ture, of reciprocal obligation, and of acorn
mon relation to tUc community.

The Public are cautioned to
beware of counterfeited Five Dollar Bills of
the Bank of the United States, atul Twenty
Dollar Bills of the Bank of North America,
federal of which have appealed in circulation,
within a few days Â°pajl; they are a good ge
neral imitation of the genuine Bills, but tuny
be difiinguifhed by the following
M A R K S.
Five Dollar Bills of the Bank of the
United States.
ALL that have appeal ed,jiave the letter F
for their Alphabetical Mark.
The Texture of the Paper is thicker and
winter and it takes the ink more freely than
the genuine paper.
The O. in the word Company is smaller
thanthÂ«M. and other letters of that word,
so that a line extended from the top of the O
so touch the top of the M would extend cot.'
fidciably above <.1* range of the whole word.
In the word Untied the letters ire narrow,
erand cloler together than tin reft 0 I the bill
The i and/in the word promiib are not
paral el, the/inclining much more lAtwaii
than the i.
The engraving is badly cxeeuted,the ftrukct
of all the Letters arc stronger and the devi.e
111 tliemargin particularly i s much toa, i, i ~ d
appears darker than in the true bills. S,m.
counterfeits bear da;e in i ry ._\Vi,cc_
as the Bank was not in operation till Decern
ber, and no five dollar bills were ilTueti in
lhat y- ar.
Twen/j Dollar Bills of the Bank of l\, tb
America.
ALL that have appealed have ihe letter
B. tor the;r alphabetical ma k.
They are printed on a paper nearly fimiiar
to that-of the counterfeit Five Dolla. NÂ«tes
above described; tie engraving is belter exe
uctcd, and they approach nearer to the ay.
pearance of the genuine bills.
The fine ruled lines through the word Tut a
?v, ini the body lot the bill, are in inimber thir
teen in the genuine L>-lis, and but twelve in
:he counterfeits.
The word Company is n>och like the (ame
word in the Five Dollar B lis fes defer ibed a
bove, the o being let's than the Â«, and others
following.
There is no stroke to the t in the word North
whereas in the genuine bills the stroke is well
defined.
The letters ent in the word Twenty, to the
left; hand at the bottom, do not come down to
the line, but are so cue as to give an irregular
appearance to the word, the 7w and thej* go
ing below them.
The signature J. Nixon, has the appear
ance of being wrtueli with Umb-bhck and
oil, and differs from other inks used iu
printing the bills and the calhier's iignaturc.
It is fuppoled these forgeries were committed
in some of the Southern States, as all the coun
terfeits thai have appealed, have cotne from
ihence, and two perfoni have been apprehend
ed in V irginia, on suspicion ol being ihe authors
of" ihem.
The reward of ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS
will be paid to any PeHdm or. Pc rfons who {hall
discover and profccute to convi&ion the Crveral
offenders of ihe following dcfci iptions or any
of them, viz.
The person or prrfons, who

The person or pet tons, who engraved the
plates. 1
THc printer or prifrers, of the bills.
tvery pcr(on who has ailed as apr rc'pal in
any other way, in the counterfeiting ai.u utter
ing the said bills.
Philadelphia, March 28. ty
Jpril 22, 1794,
Other counterfeit bills
ol the Bank of the Uuit/d States Have appeared
in circulation.
The denomination is of TWENTY DOL
LARS,and the alphabetical mark is the let
ter B.
Tbey may be diftinguilhed from the genu
ine by the following MARKS :
The paper of ihe counterfeit! is of a more
tender texture and gloiley furfacc than i!,e
genuine, and there is no mark in them.
The letter c. in the word Ca&ier, in ilie
true bills is strongly marked, whereas in tlx
counterfeits, .he whole letter i. a fine hair
trokc, evidently in ?.a unfinifhed state. T!*
letter a in the word demand, is ba-.lv f.rm.d
and the whole word ill done, and there is no
comma at the end of it, as there is in tlx
genuine bills.
""H 1 * marginal device, is much dajker 'a
t ie faile, than in the genuine bills owing to
the (hide [trokes beingcoaifei, n-.uch i caier
together, and conlequently much more nu
merous. Ihis difference fti ikes it* eye at :.rji
v >ew.
rfwartl of ON E THOUSAND
DOLX.AKS, will be paid for apprehending,&
