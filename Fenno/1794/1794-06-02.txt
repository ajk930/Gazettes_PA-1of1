These compliments were accompanied by
civic gifts, as well as felicitations 6n the la
bors of the National Representatives, and
invitations that they should remain at
their post.
4 Germinal, March 24.
The Convention approved of the fol
lowing proclamation to the people.
" AT the moment when the nation is
riling by vifiories to its deftincd glory :
At the moment it is preparing for new
conflicts against the tyrants of Europe,
their vile agents, disguised in the midft'oi
you, were on the point of aflaffinating
and precipitating the people into slavery.
" The plan of a bloody counter-revolu
tion was prepared ; the national reprelen
tatiou was 011 the point of difappearirrg
under the steel of a (Tiffins; the blood of
patriots was to be shed by the fury of con
spirators ; the Republican government
was to be annihilated, to substitute tyran
! Ny in its place ; the armies were to be de
livered up to the uncertainty of events, or
to the perhdy of some chiefs ; and, as
soon as tyranny fhouid be established with
in, the- foreign armies were to have con
summated the enterprize.
" The horrible conspiracy, profound
with' regard to the means employed, and
immerse in its ramifications, was conceiv
ed at a foreign court, and organised with
in our bosom. The success of this con
spiracy was confined to the common ene
mies of the revolution, to the criminals
in our prisons, and to hypocrites, who
deceived the people by pretended patrio
tism. In one day, in a few hours, at a
signal given, all the counter-revolutionilts
were to be re-united, all the villains arm
ed, all the prisons opened, all the afTaffins
unchained, and the Convention was to be
on a sudden furronnded with ruins, with
the dead bodies and blood of Patriots.
" In vain had our efforts sustained the
revolutionary government. On one fide,
a fatal inertness was imprefled on its ope
ration ; 011 the other, counter-revolution
ary measures prevailed. For some chvs,
the theatres, and public places had been
filled with Aristocrats, and the ftrects
with Conspirators. The women insulted
the public iriifery by a mad and foolifh
luxury; and the ferocity of the egotists
raised a famine within, while the (tipen
daries prepared it without. The winds
from all quarters blew the storm against
the National Representation and the Pa
triots ; while calumny and treason inun
dated the Departments and the armieswith
falfe news. In one, news was published
that the enemy was within fix leagues of
Paris; in another it was afierted, that the
design was formed to mount tha white
cockade ; and, in the more diflant de
partments, it was said, that Paris was
surrounded by foreign troops. At Paris
it was insinuated, that La Vendee was in
full force, and the apprehensions of the
people received atevery iuftani imprefiions
fatal to liberty.

United States, 2llt May, 1794.
Gentlemen of the Senate, and of
the House of Representatives,
I Lay before yon in confidence* fun
di y papers, by which you will perceive the
state of affairs between us and the fix na
tions, and the probable cause to which it
is owing. And also certain information*
whereby it would appear that some en
croachment was about to be mhde on our
territory by an officer and party of Bri
tilh troops. Proceeding upon a supposi
tion of the authenticity of this informati*
on, aLhough of a private nature, I have
caused the representation to be made to
the Biitilh minister, a copy of which ac
companies this message.
It cannot be neceflary to comment up
on the very ftrious nature of such an en
croachment, nor to urge that this new
of things fuggeils the propriety of
placing the United States in a posture of
effectual preparation for an event which,
notwithstanding the endeavors making to
avert it, may by circumstances beyond
our controul be forced upon us.

Extract from the Columbian Centincl.
Speech of Mr. S. d.lhered kef are the Anar
chy Club in Philadelphia, at a fpei'ui
revolutionary fitting.
Parties, Mr. Preiident, are prone to
too far ; but on one fubjift the most
jbvious and the molt likely in the world
to kindle all their rags, they do not Â«o
tar enough. Even the Virgininne do not
know, or seem not to have fufficiently
ronlidered. how completely Bi.iijh irjlu
â¢n:e has made a Have of opinion. Nay,
t appears that the very efforts to get fiee,
lave multiplied the cords that restrain our
lherty, while thev diminish the strength
-if our resistance a*)d sharpen all the pangs
)f jur impatience : As a fly, in a spider's
iveb, only kicks himfelf into the toils of
Jiis enemy, and uses his legs the more to
confine them. I burn, Sir, 1 freeze, I
"wont, I cnoak, while 1 give vent to my
ieinocratic rage, in describing an evil
â vhich is aggravated by its ordinary reme
dies. Britilh influence ; wherever I go,
f fee it, I Infer it. It flicks as tight as
he skin, nay tighter; for if a man were
layed alive he would not get rid of it.
Dur grand-mothers were British, our mo-'
hers suckled in the poison which tainted
>ur infant lips. Ccngrefs ought to pro
vide French nurses if not French fathers
"or our children, otherwise this inheritable
juality of original fin will never be washed
>ut. We do not now import British iires,
jut we sprung from them, we speak rheir
anguage, we follow their fafhions. Wit
less breeches, they are not the French
arte. They are againfl liberty because
here is restraint in them ; they are a kind
>t funding system which every man is
hackled \Vitli ; a slavish order in focietv
rhich fhotild be thrown off at a time of
â¢e-generation, when the ideas of order and
ill the fooleries of courtly etiquette are
ibolifhed or abolilhing.
What is there here fir, that is not Bri
ifh ? Our debates what are they but Bri
ifh, and the influence that arises from
hem are corrupt, oppressive and degrad
ng, which has increased, is increasing,
ind ought to be diminifljed, nay, to be
Jelfroyed by sequestrating.
Ii they should grow up again, if the
lead of that cursed hydra, credit, that
nan-eater, or rather that monster that
wallows an hundred negroes like so many
ugar-plumbs, and that forbids by her ma
fic, the coach wheels of a democratic
Lord to turn round, I fay if that devil,
ifter being killed by a fequefii ation a a
hould come to life, kill him again.
But alas all this is a vision that has fled,
ind left behind it, the weariness of over
trained exertion and the deje&ion that
ollows the diiappointment of the moil ex
ulting confidence.
Thus British influence grows stronger
[>y rettriclion, as the quelling an insurrec
tion Itrengthens government.
Wc ourselves exhibit many damning
proofs how close this centagion flicks to
Â»ur proceedings. We talk and write a
gainst the national government, as if it
were British. Our paragraphs and efTays,
if not exact copies are prodigiously like
those works in England, which have so tie.
voted and Iran/ported their patriotic au
thors. All Grub-street bio, Toms, all fleet
ditch breathes perfume, in the Genera
Advtrtifer.
Our government follows British exam
pies, and we express our censures of it ii
a form of words that is as thread-bare ii
England as our coats,
mi i -
Ihe leaders of our body are, it must
be owned, Britifli ; and that accounts for
the force of British habits j thev abuse
our government, as they have used to do
their own, and indeed they seem to for
get they have crossed the sea. It is re
marked that a fubjciSt of Britain, will
land for the firft time at a wharf in this
city, and before he lleeps in it he will pen
a paragraph representing the horrid op
pression of the excise in the back coun
try, where he proposes to reft his weary
patriotism, or rather to eagage it in new
labors. It is zeal against oppreflion and
foreign influence will soon bring him for
v.-ard into public life to speak oracles of
mountain viit'dom concerning trade and
navigation. All this is imit.ttiou of Bri
tain. There, as well here, speech-making
patriotifin fecks office as its prey. The
beast is mod fierce when he is hungry and
after being crarn'd he is arovvzy and tame.
If even we are obliged to yield to the
defpotiim of Brit Mb habits, let us no lon
ger deceive ourselves with the expecta
tion of success in. the trivial plans of re
form we have adopted, no,- we must make
great efforts to produce the radical and
regenerating changes we have in contem
plation. We must rife in mass and leave
not one Hone upon another of all the fa
bric which cur ancestors, in servile imita
tion of -their ancestors, have erfccled, And
which I will venture to call the temple
of idolatry. Let lis deface the right an
gled triangle of our abused atfedtioris, and
form a circleâthis club. No hocus fo
cus of three branches in government.â
J lius we may club America, so as to re
vive a revolutionary energy 5 change the
language and speak French, export our
prieftsâbanifti the aristocracy of credit,
public and piivate, and put all property
into a state of requisition. Then the
chains of British influence will melt then
we ftiall exhibit the humanity of Algiers
and the elegance and refinement of Caf
frarie, the Psalms of David, a Britjlh
hierarchial work shall give place to the
hymn of Marfeillei, reason shall be wot
fhipped and man shall be free !
For the Gazette of the United St at
Mr. Fenno,
The appointment of Mr. Monroe to 'he Em
bafly to France, not bavin* produced ore
ftngle complaint in a certain party paper,
I muji attribute its Jilence to the absence
of one of his correspondents, and to the en
gagements of an other. As I have no doubt
the friends oft Lit paper will be much difi
appointed at its silence or. so important an
occet/ion, I fend y6u some hints for a fcuu
paragraphs, whteo the Editor of that pa
per may republifh by desire or inclination,
as bejl futs his tujir) -viz.
A correspondent remark# that the late no
mination of a certain Senator to a foreign
Embafly, is a perseverance in that dangerous
fyltem which goes to the deflruction'of all
the barriers which our excellent conftiiution
hath eredted. The appointment of a mem
ber of the Federal Senate to a foreign million
is a measure pregnant with the moll fatal
consequences to the liberties of the people.
What check shall we have on the conduct of
the Executive, if he can l'educe from his poll
a watchful cerberus, the guardian of our
precious rights ? what l'ecurity for our pri
vileges if their champions are, on account cf
their inlluence, talents & opposition to the en
croachments of power, snatched from that
ilation where those talents were dreaded and
sent into an honorable exile ? Will not such
a practice, if countenanced, change the Se
nate into a docile and iervile body, by ex
t parting from it all thole pofleflcd or firmnefc,
or independence and aversion to arbitral y
authority ? What a door for faction, intrigue
and cabal is opened by this precedent! a
member of the Senate, ambitious and desir
ous of a foreign appointment has nothing to
do but to clamor against the Executive,
thwart his views, intrigue with a foreign
minister, call for the correspondence of the
present Ambaflador, and censure it as hoflile
to the country where he refidts, manoeuvre
with the foreign minister here to have him
recalled, and then the Executive, to get rid k
ot so troublesome an opponent, will o.r.ain
ly appoint him the fuccefior of the recalled
Ambaflador.âBefides, this courting system
will be a bounty to fadtion and a discourage
ment to the friends of good government â
hen opposition to the measures and views
of the Executive is rewarded with honors,
and the lteady and patriotic friends of order
are palled by with neglecl, a premium is of
fered tor anarchy and antifederalifm. Every
man, whose talents exceed his virtues, will
seek that path, however injurious to his
country, which certainly leads to honor and
emolument.
Again, is it proper that the man, who, in
â¢ s Senatorial capacity, has voted for or

Aha their privateers make no calculations

privateer brigâ the men throwing tiiemfelves
into the water, and fwimmirig to the ihip
with their cutlafie-s, in their mouths, and
boarding her os all quarters. Onr privateer
of the lfle of France arrived with a large
lum of ransom money for fever al velfels flic
had taken, and besides had ordemi 2 i prizes
into port. A private expedition* had gone
irom the lfle of France against Batavia, the

who informs that a body of Gen. Clark's

tentions were, when a fufficient number
thould have collected, to proceed to Loui

that place, as has been mentioned in

for this purpose not having been collect

The Public are cautioned to
beware of counterfeited Five Dollar Bills of
the Bank of the United States, and Twenty \
Dollar Bills of the Bank of North America,
several of which have appeared in circiclation
within a few days jhaft ; they are a good ge
neral imitation of the genuine Bills, but may
be diftingui/hed by the following
MARKS.
; Five Dollar Bills of the Bank the
| - United States.
\ ALL that have appeared hav? the letter F.
for their Alphabetical Mark.
| The Texture of the Paper is thicker and
whiter and it takes the ink more freely than
s the genuine paper.
, The O. in the word Company is smaller
than the M. and other letters of that word,
so that a line extended from the top of the O,
to touch the top of the M. would extend con.
fiderably above the range of the whole word,
s In tht word United the letters are narrow.
> erand cloffer together than the reft of the bill
The i and Jin the word promise are not
parallel, the J inclining much more forward
than the i.
1 The engraving is badly executed,the strokes
n of all the Letters are stronger and the device
c in themargin particularjy is much coarlcr and
Â° appears darker than in the true bills; Some
h at the counterfeits bear date in J 791 âWhere-
in as the Bank was not in operation till Decern
ber, and no five dollar bills were issued in
ihat year.
Twenty Dollar Bills of the Bank of North
0 America.
>Â° ALL that have appeared have the letter
>0 B for their alphabetical mark.
)0 Tl>ey are printed on a paper nearly similar
;G to that of the counterfeit Five Doilai Notes
>0 above described ; the engraving is exe
ucted, and they approach neater to the ap
'Â° pearance of the genuine bills.
o The fine ruled lines through the word Twen-
J0 (v, in the body of the bill, are m number th r
)Q teen in the genuine b.lls, and but twelve in
__ the counterfeits.
)0 The word Company is much l ike the fame
)0 word in the Five Dollar Bills as defer ibed a
-50 bove, the 0 being lels than them, and others
â following.
50 There is no stroke to the t in the word North
n- whereas in the genuine bills the stroke is well
s, defined.
ly T*he letters ent in the word Twenty, to the
left hand at the bottom, do 'noi come down to
SI. the line, but are so cut as to give an irregular
g* appearance to the word, the 1 w and go
of ing below them.
10 The fignatuie J. Nixon, has the appear
be ance of being written with lamb-black and
01, and differs from Other inks used in
nt printing the bills and the cashier's signature.
r y It is supposed these forgeries were committed
er in lorne of the Southern Slates, as all the coun-
Ilt rerfcits thai have appealed, have come from
1 hence, and two periods have been apprehend
ed in Virginia,on (ufpicion of being the author
of them.
The reward of ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS
will be paid to any Perlon or Persons who shall
discover and prolecute to conviction the/lever al
offenders of the following defci iptions or any
of them, viz.
The person or pcrfons, who manufaÂ£fured
the paper on which the Bills are printed.
The person or peitons, who engraved the
plates.
The printer or printers, of the bills.
Every perf >n who has aÂ£ted as a principal in
any other way, in the counterfeiting and utter
ing the said bills.
Pniladelphia, March 28, 1794
April 22, 1794,
Other counterfeit bills
of the Bank of the United States have appeared
in circulation.
The denomination is of TWENTY DOL
LARS,and the alphabetical mark is the let
ter B.
They may be diftinguiflied from the genu
ine by the following MARKS :
The paper of the counterfeits is of a more
tend r texture and glofley fur face than the
genuine, and there is no water mark in them.
Ttee letter C. in the word Cashier, in the
true bills is ftrorigly marked, whereas in the
counterfeits, the whole letter is a fine hair
itroke, evidently in an unfinifhed state. The
letter a in the word demand, is badly formed
and the whole word ill done, and there is no
comma at the end of it, as there is in the
genuine bills.
The marginal device, is much daiker in
the falfe, than in the genuine bills owing to
the shade strokes being coarferj much nearer
together, and consequently much move nu
merous. This difference ft; ikes the eye at fit ft
view.
The fame reward of ONE THOUSAND
DOLLARS, will be paid for apprehending, &
profecuiting to conviction the several above
described Offenders in refpe<st to this, as to
the last described bills.

THE grand principle df Equality, if right
ly underwood, is the only balis on wjiich
univerfa! justice, sacred order', and perfect
freedom, can be firmly built, and permanent
ly secured. The view of it exhibited in this
elTay, at the fame time that it reprelfes the
itrfojeiice of aflice, the tyranny ofpride, a-<>d
the outrages of oppreftTon ; confirmÂ®, in the
mpft forcible manner, the neceiHty of subor
dination, and the just demands of lawful au
thority. So far indeed, from loosening the 41
bands of society, that it maintains inviolate,
every natural and every civil diftinftion,
draws more clol'ely every social tie, unites in
one harmonious and justly proportioned sys
tem, and brings men together on the even
ground of the inherent rights of human na
ture, of reciprocal obligation,-and of a com
mon relation to the community.
