Â» CONGRESS.
House of Reprefentaiivu
January 30.
In committee of the ivbole on Mr. MaJifon't
refolulions.
SPEECH or Mr. FOSTER,
of Maflachufetts.
UPON the firft statement of the pro
portions which have been so long under
the coafideTation of the committee, I wa*
one of the individuals who had to examiiu
the iubjeit in the- various lights under
whicli it ought to be viewed, in order to
form an opiTiion upon the ucceflity, the
expediency, and the probable consequen
ces of the adoption of the system which
the resolutions contemplate. I have litt
ened with unremitted attention to the de
bates, and have endeavoured that a liugle
obfeivation of importance (hould not el
cape unnoticed. The resolutions, at filit
view, appeared importantâoil a critical
and attentive examination they do not ap
pear less soâthey confefledly involve a
"great variety of interestsâinterests of the
highest magnitude, and> if adopted, will
eiTentiallyalterthecircumftances,the views,
the commercial profpe&s, and the civil
policy of the National government.
The candour and ingenuity with which
the fubjcct has been difculfed, have given
me great fatisfaclion. The arguments
against and in support of the resolutions,
have been displayed in a manner highly
gratifying to an enquiring mind. The
variety of view's in which the fubjeft has
been examinedâits relative connection
with our agriculture, our manufafhircs,
and the whole civil polity of the United
Statesâthe influence which the system
would have upon our intercourse with fo
reign nations, and the probable effe&s re
â¢fulting to them, more especially to France
and Great-Britain, have afforded much
information ; and I am happy in acknow
ledging my obligations to the gentlemen,
who have, with so much ability and pre
cision, favored us with their sentiments.
Much time, Mr. Chairman, has been
already spent in the discussion. The fub
jeft is momentous and required it. The
affirmative and the negative of the ques
tion have been ably advocated and ably
supported.
A general review of the arguments may
not perhaps be without its life.
111 support of the resolutions it has been
urged,
That the measures of the tendency
hereby contemplated have been long ex
pected by the citizens of the United States.
That the regulation of our commerce
was the principle which fir'A induced the
formation and ellablifhment of our present
constitution,
That the adoption of the resolutions will
probably excite a competition in foreign
countries, as well as among our own citi
zens, operating to produce fuppliea of
such articles as we may with, from other
nations than those who now furnifh us,
and as an encouragement to the domestic
manufacture of the fame articles.
That they will tend to the increase of
our navigation, enable 11s to obtain our
proper {hare of the carrying trade and en
joy those benefits and advantages to which
from our relative situation and existing
circumstances we are entitled.
That, by a pursuit of this system, we
may injure the individuals, particularly
the manufacturers, and consequently the
governments of other countries, and make
our anemies feel the extent of our power,
our abilities to injure them, and thenc*
induce a proper refpeft for our rights and
interests, and our government.
That the probable diminution of our
revenues, from the poflible diminution of
our imports, would, iu some degree, be
counter-balanced by the increase of the
duties contemplated by the resolutions.
That wt are bound to obtain repara
tion for the injustice done to individuals
of our own country, by regulations con
travening the Laws of Nations, made by
some of the belligerent Powers ; or, in
default of obtaining such reparation, we
are bound to compensate the damages
which such individuals have sustained.
That provision is hereby proposed to
be made, for raising monies to compen
sate, in the firlt instance, the individuals
thus injured.
That leaving dur trade to regulate it
felf, is, in fad, leaving it to be regulated
by foreign nationt.
That jealousy and ill-will have always
marked the line of conduct of Great-Bri
tain toward America. She has never ex
ecuted the treaty of peace, (he carried
away our Negroes, (he detained our weft
era posts, (he excited and encourages the
Indian war, (he has let loose the Alge
rines, (he has violated our neutrality and
committed spoliation on our (hips at sea.
That the balance of our trade with
Great-Britain is now much against usâ
this has produced on her part an extensive
credit, operating as a grievance, creating
a foreign influence, which pervades the
mercantile and trading part of the corn
munity, may extend into our public coun
cils, and have au undue e(feÂ£l on our go-
vernment
That we have all the necessaries of life
produced in our own country, and conle
quently have greater advantages in esta
blishing such regulations, beyond what
are enjoyed by a populous and manufac
turing nation-
That (hould the proposed system be a
dopted, and carried into effect, there is
no piobability of retaliation on the part
of Great-Britain ; (hould (be be disposed
(he cannot effect it. If the iflue require
felf-denial, we can endure the evil with
the greater advantage, and may fafcly
calculate upon a complete triumph.
That Britain it now at war againll re
publican principles, and our commerce
enables her to prosecute that war.
That the balance of our trade with
France has always been in our favor. That
friendlliip and dilinterefted benevolence
have ever marked her conduct towards
the United States.
That gratitude to the French natioq
requires us to turn the current of our
trade from Britain to them.
That the system contemplated by these
resolutions will induce France to confer
on us additional favors ; and finally, that
by with holding our commerce from G.
Britain, we .'hall aid the cause of the
French, who are at war against despotism
draggling for liberty, and the rights of
freemen.
In oppoCtion to the resolutions it is
said,
That though measures similar to those
now contemplated, may have been here
tofore expe&ed, a necefiity for their adop
tion does not now exist.
That regulations have already been
made, which have had a happy influence
in increasing our commerce, our manufac
tures and our navigation.
That our commercial advantages, our
filheries, our seamen, and our ships, have
been progrcflively increasing since the a
doption of our present happy constitution
âthat their numbers and growth are {till
increasing, and under the influence of the
existing system, will continue to do so as
rapidly as will be beneficial to the com
munity.
That although additional duties on fo
reign tonnage might encourage our navi
gation, yet the increase ought to be made
with caution ; a very great or undue pro
partion of American capital being veiled
in navigation would be hazardous, and in
cafe of a war the loss would distress us ex
tremely.
That an increafement of our shipping
beyond what is necessary for our importa
tions, would be injurious ; the surplus ne
ceflarily deduiSs from a capital which is
wanted for other purposes, and may be
more beneficially improved in the increase
of our manufactures and agriculture
Anexcefsof zeal to promote our com
merce and navigation, is more dangerous
than a deficiency.
That it is the interest of the landholder
that our trade should be free, and that fo
reign, as well as domestic vessels, should
be admitted to our wliarves, and permit
ted to receive our produce, for exporta
tion without reflraint.
That should additional duties be impof,
ed, difcriminatiort would be impolitic and
unjust ; the commerce of one nation
ought not to be encouraged to the detri
ment of another ; if there is no friendship
in trade, it does not follow there must be
enmity.
That in eftablilhing a commercial sys
tem and forming a decision on the fubjedt
now under the consideration of the com
mittee we should divert ourselves of poli
tical views, we ought not to fuffer our
resentments to influence us ; the feelings
excited by the consideration of the Indi
an war, the depredations of the Alge
rines, or the inexecution of the treaty of
peace, have nothing to do" with a fnbjeft
which refpe&s the regulation of our com
merce only- To obtain redress for any
political injuries we may have fuflained.re
courfe in the firft instance should be had
to peaceable negociations which would
probably prove effectual.
That the object of the present relblu
tions appears to be a commercial warfare,
which in all probability would be produc
tive of one far more serious.
That the expediency of forming any
commercial treaties may well be quettion
ed, they neceflarily connect us in the po
litics of Europe, a connexion which can
never be falutarv for America ; but if com
mercial treaties are formed, mutual tnttrcji
(hould be considered as the fundamental
principle.
That the refolutioni before us contain
only an affixation of aiding our naviga
tion, commerce, and manufa&urcs'; they
will in fact, prove detrimental to each of
them, by producing a temporary ftagna
tionatleaft, of the one, and unavoidable
embaraflments upon the other.
That high-duties, by augmenting the
prices of such goods as might be import
ed, would only operate as taxes and bur
thens against our own citizens, who are
theconfumers ; at the fame time answer
ing no valuable purposes to us with the
government of Great Britain, against
which they are profefledly pointed, nor of
fering any particular encouragement to
our own manufactures.
That the goodness of a market, iÂ« to be
determined by the relative proportion of
the dearnefs or cheapness, of the articles
fold or purchased ; and that on a compa
rative view, the commercial system of G.
Britain is more favorable to us, than that
of any other foreign nation. With refpeft
to our exports (he is and ever has been,
a better cullomer than France, in the ra
tio of two to one.
That the reftriftionscomplained of were
in existence previous to our becoming an
independent nation ; they are in fa6i, a
part of her colonial establishment and Hill
operate only as they refpeft her colonial
dependencies.
That the industry of our citizens has
been, and is nourished by the aid of a fo
reign capital; for which credit is an ax
cellent substitute, so far from* being inju
rious it is highly beneficial, and, in the
present situation of our country, has a
happy effect in the promotion of (hip
building, manufactures, and agriculture :
admitting it was an evil, it is merely a
municipal regulation and altogether be
yond the controul of Congress.
That Great Britain is able to supply
us with such articles as we want, in great
abundance, and on better terms than any
other nation ; {he has it in her power, and
is willing to give us credit: the French,
cannot or will not do it.
That the influence of Britilh credit on
our public councils is chimerical j the fal
fity of the idea is apparent, by the part
taken and so ably supported by the rtf
pe&abie gentlemen, who rep-efent a part
of the United States, which has received
the molt extensive credit.
That (hould we be deprived of this ad
vantage, merchants of great capitals only
could trade. A monopoly by the wealthy,
would increase the prices of the articles
eonfumed, and the enterprize and induflry
of young men, who have need of credit,
would be checked and discouraged.
That the faith of the United States has
been heietofore pledged, appropriating
the monies raised by certain existing du
ties, to the discharging of public debt.' A.
system, like the one propofcd, tending to
the diminution of the amount of those du
ties, would be a breach of faith difgraceftil
as well as unjuftifiable.
That the conduct of France, as refpe&s
our commerce, our navigation and our
fiiheries, has uniformly evidenced a felfiih
policy ; and that we have no privileges to
boait of in consequence of our present ex
isting commercial treaty with that nation.
This, Mr. Chairman, is a summary view
of the principal arguments which have
been adduced on the one fide and on the
other of the important question before the
committee. Many ingenious calculation;,
observations, comparisons and documents,
fraught with information and tending to
elucidate the fubjee}, have been offered ;
I have listened with attention to the whole
of them, and, on a careful review it ap
pears to me that this is not the proper
time for us to introduce very eficntial al
terations in our commercial systemâthat,
be our wishes what they may respeCting
the issue of the present war in Europe,
neither duty or good policy will usf
to become parties. The ftricl principles
of neutrality ought to influence cur con
duitâthat the measures proposed would
have a very bad tendencyâthat they would
produce great inconvenience to our reve
nuesâa temporary to our'com
mcrceâa future augmentation of the (hac
kles under which it now laborsâdeprive
our fellow-citizens of enjoyments which
they have a right to poiTefsârifrn indus
try from its natural channel, induce a ne
cefiity of land taxes'for the exigencies and
support of government, prove injurious to
public credit, be ruinous to our agricul
ture, and, in the present crisis might pre
cipitate us into a war : Evils which justice, humanity, true principles of patriot
ism, the duties of morality and the best
iiiterella of our country require us to de
precate, aud, if potiible avoid.
I have endeavored to examine and con
sider the fubjeit with candor. I have
formed mjr opinion upon serious delibera
tion ;-.nd feel an impression of duty when
the queftionTkallbc takcu, to vote againit
(he proportions.

THEATRICALS.
[The following was not received in season
for Saturday's Gazette.]
OBSERVERâNÂ°. V,
LAST evening, at the New Theatre,
were exhibited to a cronded and brilliant
audience, the JEALOUS WIFE, and
the LIAR. The Obfervcr accidentally
overheard a gentleman and lady remarking
upon the players, and from some emphatic
words, was induced to listen to their dis
course. The gentleman with much fang
fro':d, observed upon one and anotherâ
This is not a Yates, a Palmer, a Wrighten,
a Kemble, a Henderfon, or a Siddons.
The lady told him Mrs. Whttlock was fil
ter to Mrs. SiddonsâEgad, fays the gen
tleman, is this the famous Mrs. Wh'tlloci ?
why (he has not a feachure of Mrs. Siddons ;
damme but Mrs. Siddons petrifies the au
dience ; why this woman, why (he has no
eyes, no face, no killing tout cnjcmble, no
true ban ton about her : pfliaw ! only fit
for boor 6 and bumkins. The gentleman,
as the Observer supposes, had, or pretend
ed he had, an acquaintance with European
Theatres and aÂ£tors ; for upon a queition
from the lady, whether Mrs. Siddons ever
a fled in comedy he said yes, he had of
ten feert her in comedy, it was her forte,
(he drew cror.ded audiences in the charac
ter of Bchidera, in Venice Preferred, and
many other of the belt comedies fh the
Englifli language. The lady observed,
that Venice Preferred was a tragedy : No,
no, said he, Venice Preferred is a tragical
plot, but that plot was discovered, and
saved the State, and so all turned out
wellâegad that makes it a comedy.
Of Mrs. Francis, in Harriet, he said,
why fne does not top her part at all :
damme, I like to fee all the characters on
fire ; that's the bon ton. Similar observa
tions and sentiments he exprefled upon all
the exhibition ; the music was a bore, and
even the Theatre itfelf was as gloomy as a
Dutch funeral.
Refletting upon the opinions of this
Standard of Tojlc, the Observer began to
feel drongly induced to pity thefc poor
Players, who had taken so much pains, to
gratify and improve us, and at the fame
time to obtain the means of an honelt liv
ing for themselves ; for if these lentiments
become general, he said to himfelf, the
Theatre mud be (hut.
Some such ideas mull have occurred to
the lady, as (he observed to the gentleman,
" Why, teally Sir, I think you are too
hard upon thefc people, for if yourfenti
ments spread, you will undo them ; and
if they are not good Players, they are
said to be honett, good chara&ersâand
deserve not severe treatment." Egad,
said the gentleman, I do not know that
âchiefly call off, I believe, from the
Theatres in Englandâand as to charac
ter, damme, if I believe any of them have
too good characters.
This brought to the Observer's recol
lection, a pafiage in his favorite author
jEfchylus:â
"'I his is the (late of man! In prosperous for-
tune,
" A shadow, pafling light, throws to the
ground
" Joys, baiclels fabric : In adversity
" Comes Malice, with a fpunge, moistened
in gall,
" And wipes each beauteous character away."
The Obfervcr, is in justice bound to
add, that since then, he has obtained in
formation from indisputable authority, that
this company of players, are persons of ir
reproachable chara&ers, as men and wo
men ; and as performers, many of them
have not left superiors, and forne jnot equals,
in Europe.âThe persons who are now on
the stage in England, the Obferyer only
knows, by hearsay; of the former actors
he had some knowledge ; and would just
mention to modern travellers, that he will
dete& their ignorance, and punish their
insolence, whenever their empty sculls,
flu'll attempt to use " the Jpungc moijlened
â¢with gall." This will only apply to a*
certain class of modern travellers, and let
such be cautious, as the Observer will
handle them without mittens.
Mrs. IVhitloci's articulation, is so per
fjdtly just, her face, her eye, and indeed
her whole attitude and gesticulation, come
f > near the model the observer had figu
red to himfelf for an adlrrfs, that he mud
do a violence to his own feelings, not to
declare, that altbo' Ihe may not be equal
to Mrs. Siddons, yet (he is so equal to
any expectations, we have entertained in
America, that the fealt of feeing and
hearing her on the ftagt, the Observer
hopes will frequently be repeated.
Mrs. Francis, in the part of Harriet,
was reserved, shewed little action or ani
mation, this the Observer, heard faulted
by manyâbut he ventures to aflert, that
nature, was much better exhibited, in that
th%n it could have been by more anima
tion. In the Obferrer's opinion, Mrs.
Francis, acted; what the author meant by
the character of Harriet; and in the cha
racter of Miss Grantham, she certainly
evinced her accurate knowledge of the
author's meaning, and there, put on ani-
mation enough.
The Observer presents his moll refpedt
ful compliments to the Ladies who attend
the Theatre, and begs them to take no
tice of Mrs. JVhitlock and Mrs. Francis,
when they speak a sentence, mark their
modulation, their accent, and, as occasion
offers, endeavor to form their own pro
nunciation ; this will be adding profit, to
amulement, and the price of their tickets,
instead of producing a talent, proper to
be hid in a napkin, will produce a ufeful
haneft of an hundred fold.
March I ft, 1794.
Captain Vanlife is arrived here from
Martinique, in a short passageâWe hear
he brings accounts of a large number of
American vefiels being thereâthat pro
visions were plenty, and the force on the
Island so refpeftable as to be under no
apprehcnfion of the English.
The consideration of Mr. Madison's
Resolutions was this day postponed to
Monday next.
We are informed the embargo in France
on American veflels is taken off.
BOSTON, February 22,
We are happy at all times to give cir
culation to intelligence, in which honora
ble notice is taken of our countrymen. In
a late London paper, mention is made,
that the Grand Majlcr of Malta, hat
eftablilhed in his principal city, a magnifi
cent AJlronomical Observatoryâto which
he had invited the most celebrated Astro
nomers of Europe. " Of the apparatus,"
fajs the account, " is an Orrery, of the
invention and conftruftion of the celebra
ted and ingenious American, Mr. Joseph
Pope."
The gall of bittcrnefs lately poured out
on the Massachusetts members in Congress
is but the dregs of the old phial. For fix
years Meflrs. Ames, Goodhue, Sedg
wick, &c. &c. have been the theme of
calumny; butat three feveraleleftions when
the 'Â« VOICE OF THE PEOPLE"
is most emphatically pronounced, we have
seen them honoured with the increasing
fuffrages of their fellow citizens, as the
reward of their independence and patrio
tism. They know, that from them their
conflituents ftili expect a continuation of
that conduit: They bid them be unmov
ed by the clamour of competitors, and
unshaken by the arts of those who would
difTolve the Union, destroy justice, intro
duce domestic infelicity, and entail on
their country the horrors of an unnecessary
foieign war !
COMMUNICATION.
The Funding System of the United
States, has long been the stalking horCe
of the antitederal scribblers. But though
the Legislature of this Commonwealth
have recently pafled a Funding Law pre
dicated on cxaÃly the fame rate of interejl,
and totally excluding every' idea of
difcrimirtaticn, not one solitary word of
complaint is uttered. The fame may
be said of the Bank of the United States.
It has been thundered in our ears as perni
cious, as dtftru&ive of liberty, &c. yet
we fee Banks daily established by.the State
governments, and from the pen of censure
not one drop of ink has been (hed. Think
ye, the public doth not discern tliefe things ?

Market-Street,
An EiTay on Slavery:
Dcfigned to exhibit in a new point of view,
its cffc&s 011 morals, and the peace of
ociety. Some la&s and calculations are offered
to prove thp labor of freemen to be much more
produdive than that ot Jlaves ; that countries are
rich, powerful and happy, in proportion as the
laboring people enjoy the fruits of their own
labor ; and hence the nrceflary conclusion, that
flavfry is impolitic as well as unjujl.

THE FIRST VOLUME OF
Ptnnfylvania State Trials.
THE want of fufficient information of the
state trials of Gieat-Britain in the early
periods of that government is now lamented :
Hi herto there hath been one trial in the
state of Pennsylvania on impeachment : âand
herealfo it is to be regretted, that, being neg r
letted at the time, the public are now left with
out fufficient information on the fubjeft of that
trial, it is however in this work designed to ref
cuefwhat can be collefled thereof from sources
of indifputaple authority, so that the fame shall
be preserved from oblivion.
Another impeachment and the second is now
depending. An officer is charged by the late
House of Reprefentattves, who hath for many
yeari been largely confided in by this state, and
hath long been at the head of the financial de
partment of the fame, and it imports the citi
zens to know hisconduft, and thecircumftanccs
which may be brought foiward on his trial.
In this work the Editor will be careful to
state the fads, as they may be brought forward,
and to lay all the evidence and papers before
the public.âWith this viewâ
The following Terms are refpefifully
fuhmitted to the Public :
I. The Work shall be printed iu octavo, with a
good type, on fine paper, and delivered to
fubfcribera at the refpe&ive places where the
fnbfcriptions are taken in, as soon as the work
shall be compleated.
11. As no conje&ure can well be made, as to
the length Â®f the present trial, the fire of the
volume cannot be afcertaiued at this timeâ
But the price (hall not exceed that of fomeof
the latest publications in this city.
111. It will contain all the preliminaries and in
cidental circumstances that may occur during
the trial of John Nicholfon, Esquire, Comp
troller-General of this commonwealth, with
thearguments of counsel oa both fides, together
with the articles of impeachment, and the
pleas and replications at large, the several re
solutions of the two branches of the state Le
gislature, refpe&ing this impeachment, and
the final decision of the SENATE refpedting
that officer.
To which will be prefixed, as much as can be
collected from authentic documents, of the im
peachment, trial, and aequital of the late Francis
Hopkinfon, Esquire, Judge of the Court of
Admiralty for the state of Pennsylvania, during
the late war, never before pnblifbed.
No money will be required before the deli
very of the book.
Subscriptions will be received by Francis
