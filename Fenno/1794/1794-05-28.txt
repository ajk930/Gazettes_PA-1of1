CONGRESS.
House of Reprefenlatives.
Friday, May 9.
\_Mr. IV. Smith's Speech Concluded.
It had been proposed that in lieu of these
stamp duties, the duties of impost should be
increased on all articles which now pay a iju
ty of seven and a halt per cent ad valorunr,
to ten per cent, befiedes the increased rates of
duties pn the enumerated articles. It was
not a little surprizing, he obfei ved, that gen
tlemen who a few days a go preditkd an ap
proaching war, whereby our existing reve
nue ariiing from import would be almolt an
nihilated, should now not only count Upon
the continuance of that revenue, but should
expect further aid from that source, or that
those who are urging a suspension of com
mercial intercourse should rely upon com
merce altogether for revenue. He was de
cidedly of opinion, that commerce wis al
ready luflicienily burthened, and that it
j would be as unjust as impolitic to add to
â¢ the burden. We ought not to rely upon
the proposed duties on the enumerated ar
ticles, which with the proposed incr afeof
tonnage conffituted an item of neaf
400,000 dollars.âTliis lie considered,
under present circumstances, a very pre*
carious resource. With refpedi to the
other new sources of revenue, being un
tried, they were uncertain ; the house
poffefled 110 data by which any accurate
ellimate could be made of their product;
under all these circumllances, while on
the one hand, the exiding revenues wouid
fall short of those of former years, and
the new revenues were either pretarious
or uncertain as to their amount, and on
the other hand ouf expences were necefia
rily much increased, and were likely to be'
Itill further increased, he was confident
the house would be fenllble of the propri
etv ncjat'vins'the motion. _ ' :
would be some difficulty in can ymg the
tax into execution ; but these difficulties
were inseparable from the very nature of
taxation, It required littie ingenuity to
discover them, and to apply to them all
the common place topics which were re
sorted to on these occasions. But he
thought that if the gentlemen would em
ploy their ingenuity and inventive facul
ties in discovering such revenues as would
enable the government to face the pre
sent exigencies, they would render mort'
service to the country, than by embarras
sing with objections, which were equally
applicable to almost every species of irn
polition.
THEATRE.
OBSERVER No. XVlt.
Mr. Fen no,
On Friday evening, Mr. Bates's night,
the New-Theatre was filled with an unu
sual numberâa more brilliant and genteef
audience has never attended. The Du
enna was well performedâthe parts have
never been better call, and the several
performers, never did themselves more
juflice,in pretenlipns to nncommort merit.
Mr. Bates has, perhaps, succeeded betted
than any other Acior in the United
States, in pleasing all descriptions of peo
pleâmay he continue to experience their
favors, in such phudits, as his benefit af
forded.
Mr. Morris's benefit was on Monday
evening ; and that truly d,eferving veteran,
was notified in a very h6nofable, as well
as beneficial mannerâa good hotife, in
point of numbers and refpe&ability, was
never more gratified, by his performance,
than by that in the character of Don Ma
nual. This AÂ£tor, has uniformly filled
his parts with great iuftnefs, but he truly
filled the character Don Manuel with pro
digious strength and elegance. Cibber,
who wrote the play, could not have pof
feficd a thought, which Mr. Morris did
not give its full exercise. His perform
ance of the scene after his daughter's mar
riage, when a mixture of extatic joy and
paternal tenderness overcomes him, wÂ«f*-"y
tertr exceeded, by any one, in ten differ
ent and celebrated Actors, whose per-,
formances of that character, the Observer
has seen ; and he believes he may fay, was
not equalled by many of that number.
Mrs. Sba'to, is one of the belt aftreffes,
in this Company; if (he does not take the
firft parts, vet her performance is mark
ed with such exact propriety, with an
uncommon ftrengthand clearness ofvpice,
that <he may be pronounced a very good
aftrefs, when compared to this as well as
other companies. .
Mr. Chalmers, never gave so Unking
proofs of his extraordinary comic talents,
- as he did in the character of Trafianti.
The Observer entertains the highest opini
on of Mr. Chalmers, as a man, and as an
aVor, in the last character, he certainly tells
a lie, with more grace than any man, he
ever saw attempt the bufinÂ»fs.
Mr. Har-wood possesses a peculiar kind
of comic fa;e, eyes, and indeed vvhqle cha
ncer. The Observer does not remember
having seen a man pofleffing that particidar
comic ability, in so great a degree. He
is a great acquisition to the itage.

II Gfnt| emen of the Senate, and of the
Houle of Representatives,
In the communications, which I have
made to Congress during the present session,
relative to foreign nations, I have omitted no
opportunity of teftifying my anx ; et to
serve the United States in peace. It is pe
culiarly therefore my duty a, this time, to
lay before you the present state of certain
hofule threats again ft the territories of Spain
in our neighborhood. -
The documents which accompany this
mefikge, develope the meafurcs which I
have taken to suppress them, and the in
telligence which has been lately received.
It drill be seen from thence, that the
fubjed has not been neglected ; that every
power, vetted in the executive on such oc
casions, has been exerted; and that there
was reason to believe, that the enterprise
projected against the Spanilh dominion*,
was rehnquilhed.
But it appears to have been revived
upon principles which set public order at
defiance, and place the pence of the United
States in the discretion of unauthorized
The means already dcpofited

such of them as are lodged in the hands
of the executive, (hall continue to be used

by the polition of our public affairs to re

stronger and more vigorous opposition
than can be given to such hoitil- move

His plan, and withdrrw t]j<* Tn?r?f
the surplus of his contingent of 20,000
which' remain here, the Gc rinanic empire
is threatened with inevitable rain ; the
Auftriana, with the army of the empire,
will never be able to defend us efficiently,
and save us from the deltrtiction which th<?
Dutchy of Deus Fonts, the Principality
of Saarbi lick, that of .Layen,and the great
er part of the luxuriant and fertile Palnti
nate, have experienced. The army of the
empire, newly raised, cannot be on their
march before the end of the fumrficr, and
even then cannot be well organized or of
great utility.I-tbwrrrr, for the present, notwithftanci
tng our defencelefs rtate, our danger is not
great. The enemy are very weak, having
cnlv 25 or 30,00 0 men in their intrench
mcnts behind the Qmecli. Strong detach

sent to their army of the North and to the
army employed in Vendee.
The French cominilfioners having com

BRUSSELS, March 25.
The precipitate and nnexpedled depar
ture of liis Royal Highness, the Arch
duke, for Vienna, hasjuit put us into the
lit mod surprize. A thousand contradic
tory, even ridiculous leafons, have been
affiled for itâbut the cause believed to
be simply this :â 
That at tlie General Council, held at
ith, where tl\e plans for the operations
if the campaign, brought by the Count
le Haddick, from Vienna, were fubmit
ed to the General, one of the fettled
>arts of the plan was, that Gen. Clairfayt
hould command the advanced army over
:he Duke of York. To this his Royal
Highncfs politiveiy objected. A difcuf
and two meetings were held, at which
Prince Charles and Lord Elgin affilted,
in In pes of fet'ling the affair, but with
out f.iccefs. The D ike of York perse
vered fn demanding to have the chiefcom
mand of the army in Flanders, under the
diredtion of the Prince de Cobourg.â
The debates were extremely warm, and
personal altercation rose, it is said, to a
violent height, infomili-h that the Duke
of York, in confecjue'ice of some words
"between the Prince of Saxe Cobourg and
himfclf, declared that the British troops
'{hotild not at\, until he had taken the
di r eÂ£tion of his Court ; Lord Elgin,
after a long conference with his Highnrfs
at Courtny, set out fqr England. Prince
Charles had appointed 9 o'clock in the
morning of Friday last, for his depar
ture, but it was retarded until midnight,
or. account of his Chamberlain, the Count
de Werterlaw not having returned from
Valenciennes, whither he was lent on a
fpeci'ii million to M. de Cobourg.
We have an unfortunate piece of news
hereâlt is said that the King of Pruflla
is determined to make a frparare peace
tfith the French Republic, and that his
troops are retiring into the Martjraviates
of Anfpach and Bareuth. This iill e
vent is confirmed by the letters received
this morning from Frankfort.

It may be depened upon as certain, that

In the house of Commons on the firfl inft.
the Chancellor of the Exchequer said, he was
sorry the house was not fuller, but he mull
now give notice of a fubjedl of Confiderible
importance. It might in the cou'rfe of the
next campaign become advifeible for his
Majesty to avail himfelf on the continent of
the afliftance of Frenchmen who are willing
to be employed in his Majesty's service there,
and that this was likely to be to a very con

purpose.

LONDONDERRY, April 8.
In this day's paper we have impartially
collected evefy article relative to the alledged
extraordinary conduct of the King of Pruf
lia, and the following seems to be the fub
itance ; Ihe miniflerial prints confidently
aflert, that his majeily will take the field this
campaign with a greater force than he did
lalt year ; and insinuate, thot it would be
prudent to give him his demand, two mil
lions of money, rather than lose his alliftance
On the other hand, all the other papers
concur in stating that a negociation is cer
tain yon foot between the Pruflian monarch
and the Trench Republic, and that his maief
ty will either retire from the war a ltogether
as a principal, or he will hire 30,000 of his
troops, at 301. a head to England ! A short
time will ftiew which of those opinions is the
true one. In the mean time, the campaign
has not yet seriously commencedâbefore this

The Public are cautioned to
beware of counterfeited Five Dollar Bills of
the Bank of the United States, and Twenty
Dollar Bills of the Bank of North America,
fever id of which have appeared in circulation
with: - a few days pajl; they are a good ge
neral imitation of the genuine Bills, but may
be diflinguifhed by the following
MARKS.
Five Dollar Bills of the Bank of the
United States.
ALL that have appeared have the letter F.
for their Alphabetical Mark.
The Texture of the Papier is thicker and
whiter and it takes, the ink more freely than
the genuine paper.
The O. in the word Company is smaller
than'the M. and other letters of that word,
so that a line extended from the top of ihe O,
to touch the top of the M. would extend con
fiderabfy above the range of the whole word.
In the word United the letters are narrow
erand closer together than thsreft of the bill
The i and fin the word promise are not
parallel, the yinclining much more forward
than the i.
The engraving is badly executed,the fttokes
of all the Letters are stronger and the device
in themargin particularly is much coarser and
appears darker than in the true bills. Some
ot the counterfeits bear date in 1791âWhere
as tho Bank was not in operation till Decern
ber, and no five dollar bills were iffueti in
ihat year.
Twenty Dollar Bills of the Bank of North
America.
ALL that have appeared have the letter
B. for their alphabetical mark. ,
They are printed on a paper nearly similar
to that of the couuterfeit Five Dollar Notes
above defciibed ; the engraving is Jurttei cxe
ucted, and they approach nearer to the apr
pearance of the genuine bills.
The fine ruled lines through the word Twen
ty, iir the body ot'the bill, ate tn number th 1
teen in the genuine b.lls, and but twelve in
the counterfeits.
The word Company is much like the fame
word in the Five Dollar Bills as defer ibed a
bove, the Â« being lets than them, and otheis
following.
There is no stroke to the t in the word North
wheraas in the genuine bills the stroke is well
defined.
The Jetters ent in the word Twenty, to the
left hand at the bottom, do noi come down to
the line, but are lo cut as to give an irregular
appearance to the word, the 'l w and tlie> go
ing below them.
The signature J, Nixon, has the appear
ance ol being written with lamb-black and
oil, and differs from other inks uied in
printing the bills and the calhier's lignatuie.
It is supposed thete lingeries were committed
in lome of the Southern States, as all the coun
terfeits thai have appeared, have come irom
thence, and two pcr-ton? .oni client:. _
Ed in Vnginia,ou suspicion of tctng the author
of them.
The reward ofo.VÂ£ THOUSAND DOLLARS
will be paid to any Perlon or Perlons who fball
discover and prosecute 10 convi&ion the several
offenders of the following defrriptipns or any
of therp, viz.
The person or persons, who manufactured
the paper on which the Bills are printed.
The person or perlons, who engraved the
plates.
The printer or printers, of the bills.
Every person who has acted as a pr ncipal in
any othei wa7, in the counterfeiting and utter
ing the said bills.
Philadelphia, March 28, 1794
April 22, 1794,
Other counterfeit bills
of the B:ink of the United States have appeared
in ci 1 culation.
The denomination is of TWENTY DOL
LARS,and the alphabetical mark is tie let
ter B.
They may be diftinguilhed from the genu
ine bv the following MAPJCS :
The paper of the counterfeits is of a more
tend 1 texture and glofley furface than the
genuine, and there is no water mark in them.
The letter C.. in the word Calhier, in the
true bills is strongly marked, whereas in the
counterfeits, the whole letter is a fine hair
troke, evidently in an unfinifhed state. The
etter a m the woid demand, is badly formed
and the whole word ill done, and there is no
comma at the end of it, as there is in the
genuine bills.
th ""T h ma * device, is much darker in
, h ln the genuine bills owing to
t 1 e being coarser, much nearer

The Firjl American Edition.
THEgrand principle of Equality, if right
ly unde;ftood, is the only basis on which
universal justice, fa tied order, and perfect
freedom, can be firmly built, and permanent
]y secured. The view of it exhibited in this
efTay, at the-fame time that it reprefles the
insolence of office, the tyranny of pride, and
the outrages of oporeflion ; confirms, in the
most forcible manner, the neceffiry of subor
dination, and the just demands of lawful au
thority. So far indeed, from loosening the
bands of society, that it maintains inviolate,
every natural and ev&ry civil diftinftion,
draws more every social tie, unites in
one harmonious and juflly proportioned fyf-"
tern, and brings men together on the even
ground of the inherent rights of hufnan na
ture, of reciprocal obli ation, and of a com
mon relation to the community.
