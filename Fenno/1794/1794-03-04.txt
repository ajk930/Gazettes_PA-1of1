[Whole No. 528.]
Congress of the United StatesÂ«
House of Representatives.
January 30.
In committee of the whole on Mr. Madifun's
refulut'ions,
The following ought to have preceded
Mr. S, Smith's Speech publilhed laffi
Saturday.
Speech of Mr. Madison.
AS it appeared, he said, that most of
the objections against the proposed Reiu
iutious. had been made by those who*
meant to combat them, and that a ouef
tion would soon be called for ; it might
perhaps be expected that he should review
those objections, arid affijjn the rrafon*
which induced him to continue in the opi
nion lie at firft entertained. He wilhed it
not to be understood, that he meant to
examine every particular argument, which
in thecourfe of fo'extenfive a difcuflion,
had been opposed to the measure. The
committee mud have perceived that some
of them had been of a nature not to me
rit an answer ; and that others had fufÃ
ciently answered themselves. He should
extend his observations to such topics on
ly as might he thought to need explanati
on, and to have an influence on the quet
tion,
Previous, however, to this general fur 1 -
vey of the ground which had been- tra>
veiled over, he fliould so far presume on
the patienee of the committee, as to re
cm' to the original opposition made by
the member from South Carolina (Mr.
Smith); and to take notice of some par
ticulars in what had been urged by him,
which were left unanswered at the time.
The gentleman had thought proper to
introduce his discourse with a very un
merited attack on the late Secretary of
State, and to mingle with it a variety of
criticisms on the facts and opinions stated
in his report, on the fubjeft under consi
deration. The spirit and manner in
which the attack had been made, and
which could not have escaped the atten
tion of the committee, would be left in
that silence which may best express the
sentiment they must have inspired.
He (hould indeed have thought it left
necefiary to take further notice than he
had already done, of the matter of the
gentleman's remarks ; if attempts'had not
been made, particularly by a friend of the
gentleman (Mr. Am?s) to give a weight
to his ftatcments aiid Inferences, which it
would be {hewn they did not merit ; and
if the task did not afford an opportunity
of elucidating some particular points relied
on, by the opponents of the.Resolutions.
It was made a charge against the Secre
tary of State, that he takes no notice of
the higher duty imposed by Great Britain
on other foreign tobacco, than is imposed
on American, (the former being 3s. 6d.
(ler. per pound, the latter is. 3d.) wl.ilft
he takes care to mention the high duty
imposed on the American ; although the
diferimination is in favor of the United
States, and is againit Portugal, a country
in particular connexion with Great Bri
tain ; and although the high duty of r/3
is immaterial to the United States, being
paid by the consumer of tobacco in Great
Britain.
It was unfortunate for the gentleman
that this charge is- fallacious in every mem'
ber of it.
I. The discrimination is not j'n favour
of the United States, either in its inten
tion, or in its operation : not in its inten
tion, because it was made in reference to
this country, when it was a part of the
British Empire, and not in reference to
us as Independent States j not in its ope
ration, because if the discrimination were
abolished, it would bring no rival of our
tobacco into the British market. This is
proved by the faÂ£t, that ill other markets,
as that of France, where no such discri
mination exiftfr, the American tobacco iÂ«
without a rival. It was well known that
this and the other apparent favors to this
country, were a remnant of the Old Coloma] cod?, which having become a dead
I itc: in the iUtute boo!;, had not yet
b.en tlÂ» uck out of it.
1. If the difcr imitation ha Jno efiTe& in
f: .-r (.1 the United States, it conld-not,
si the iame rcalon, be a prejudice to Por
tugal. If it were neccflary and proper to
go into the euquiryÂ» more dircdt proofs
CtoulJ he give# on thispoint.
3. High duties do affect the United
STaU'S whiclV pioducc the article,'though
j'.niil by the Britifti containers. They
he a double effect: They leiTcn tlie
quantity called for; and by leflening the
competition, they lessen also the price.
1 ilis wis a truth that could need no com-
rrie.it.
It was to be remarked however, that
the zeal of the gentl:mÂ«Ti cn this fubjeit
y. 's that it had led him to extend
ti.e fallacy of his reasoning to rice, the
II â¢ pie article of his own state. This arti
c>- '-".'s 1 duty of 7/4 fter. per hundred
weighty but like the duty on tobacco, be
ing pafd by the consumer, was laid to be
oi little concern to us.
vali liie price or rice los ftfcrli ner S the
d.ilv i;
t!. m G:
\v:ui cannot aiford to eat ric*e at the price
oÂ» i of, and the class who are willing to eat
it at 17/4 are prohibited the confu.mption
by the duty. Wa3 this a circumstance of
no concern to rhe rice planters ?âThe
gentleman (hould have been reminded of
his error by It is own arguments.
As an apology for the duty impofedirt
Great Britain, he tells* us it was meant to
prevent the use of ric? as a fuhjiitutr, for
the brea J-ftuffs produce d by Great Britain
herfelf. Without the preventing duty
th !i, rice would have b.'on fuljiltutcd in
place of wheat, in the opinion of the Bri
ti 'i Pirl unent, a;id the demand for it, 111
the Brit fh market, fa far increased.
As a merit in the Britilh Weft-India
rc-;.!l ; .ions ov-r thofc ot Fiance, it was
fined by tiie gentleman, that rice in the
Welt-Indies is a common food ; that in
the BHtifh, the importation bf it is free,
in the Fier.ch, subject to a duty* though
an inconsiderable one. It. Britain th.n,
W> .re there Is a high duty, rice "s not an
ni i.ele of common f*>ori *. in the islands
wnere there is no duty, it is a common
so Â»d ; and th? advantage of the British
vr c 'l I market to us over the French,
i :, t:\at the duty in the latter favors cheap-
ef fubjiituta
Another proof of the dlfpofition of
G,cat-Britain to favor the United States
in tie Weft-India market, is the prohibi
tiijn of al! fbroi rice but the American.
The fame remark may be repeated here,
wli vh was applied to the discrimination in
t.nvor of our tobacco. It is an oldcoloi:y
re atioo that has no effeil whatever.
What other foreign rice couid be brought
to the Weft-Indies ? Is it the East India
lie â  ; That is prohibited by its dil'rance.
Is it the liee oi Portugal ? That is prohi
!<:.'Â«! by the laws of Portugal, and proba
bly also by the lower price eÂ£ the Carolina
rice.
The inference which the gentleman had
d iwr.j'Yoni the comparative regulations of
Great Britain and Fiance on the fubjeft of
rice was so curious that it was worth a
moment's attention.
The fdtfts Mr. M. observed, stood thus.
In France the duty is 1-8 per cent. In
the French iflandt the duty is 1 percent.
In the British free with a prohibition of
other foreign rice.
As the duty of 1 per cent, is scarcely
and the prohibition, as (hewn, is
merely nominal, the inequality in the
illands may be regarded as too immaterial
to affe& the cotnparifon.
Pal Ting to the two prcfent states, the
duty in France is 1-8 per cent.âThe du
ty in Great Britain, 50 or 60 percent.
Here then is nearly an equality in one
pait, and a difference of 50 or 60 per
ceot. in the other part of the two domini
ons ; and yet the gentleman could fay,
vus not easy to pronounce, whether the
article of rice Hands on a better footing
in the system of one, than in the system
of the other.
An'rther charge ngainft the Secretary
of State is, that his report calls the discri
minating duties in Great Britain in favor
<>t American wood, small, whereas thev
;.re confiderabie, and iu several inllances,

Friday, Feb. 18.
The Committee on Fortifications, bro't
in another report this day which was read
âthis proposes fortifying m thÂ« princi
pal ports of the United States.
Mr. Sedgwick called up a report of a
fcle& committee to whom it had been re
ferred, " to report whether any and what
sum was necetfary to be loaned for the
ferrice of the current year," the purport
of which was that it was expedient, that
tin- Preftdent fliould be authorised to bor
row 1,000,000 dollars if in his opinion the
fam< should be necessary. The report
was referred to the committee of the
whole,
After the report was read, Mr. Sedg
wick said it was the duty of the fele&
committee, to state the several steps which
had been taken in the progress of their
enquiry, and the fa&s which had come to
their knowledge, during the inveftig*-
tion ; that the result which was expressed
in their report, might have its merits de
cided on by the committee of the whole.
Mr. Sedgwick dated that however in
adequate the actual receipts of the reve
nue might be, to difftiarge all the de
mands which might be made on the go
vernment ; there was in fa ft no deficien
cy 111 the funds appropriated to the dif
clrarge of fhofe demands. The deficit
was owing merely to the credit which for
the convenience and benefit of trade, was
allowed to the merchants ; and that in fa ft
the bonded duties were more than equal
to face all the dem.inds which were con
templated. That this credit, it would
be remembered extended from four months
to two years.
He next dated that by the report now
in the pofleflion of the committee, the
deficiency ot the end of the present quar
ter would amount to 621 ,294 dollars and
18 cents. The- feleft committee were
not fully acquainted with the hank tranf
aftions in relation to the treasury, and
were uncertain, whether money deposited
in banks by collectors of revenue, was
considered as in the trcafurr from the
time of the deposit. He observed that
th'S doubt arose from considering the law
conftitutmg the treafu.-y department* by
which it appeared that the Secretary's
warrant well required for .paying
money in, as for ifTuinjj. it from the trea
sury. It might therefore happen, if on
the deposit, money whb not considered as
in the treasury, that the apparent deficit,
reported of 621,294 dollars and 18 cents,
might exist, while in fit ft, there might be
at the disposal of government, a fufficient
sum compleatly to answer every demand.
Mr. Sedgwick said that contemplating
the fubieft in this view the feleft commit
tee had thought it their dutv to submit
certain questions to the Secretary, which
they had accordingly done, the import
of which was, " whether money collect
ed on account of the United States, in
banks, was from the time of deposit, con
sidered as in the treasury ? Or, are any,
and if any, what means are neceflary to
subject money so to the con
trouf of the treasurer ? And in the latter
cafe, who is from the time of such depo
sit until it partes into the treasury, respon
sible to the United States ? Is any money
now so deposited, capable of being drawn
into the treasury ! And if anv, is the
probable amount filch, as to' render a pre
sent provision for a loan inexpedient or
unneceflary !"
Mr. Sedgwick then read a letter ad
tfreffed to him as Chairman of the Selefl
Committee, from the Secretary of the
Treasury ; with the following copy of
which, he has been good enough to fur
ni(h the printer.
Tieafury Department, Feb.
2jth, 1794.
SIR,
The following are answers to the questi
ons (fatted in your Letter of the 2 2d inft.
Answer to Qtu.llion the firft.
All monies colleded 011 account of the
United States, and depofied in the bants
to the credit of the Treasurer, are consid
ered as in the Treasury from the time of
the depvfit. The Heady course with re
gard to the (landing revenue is that the
money deposited in bank, patTes immedi
ately to the credit of the Treafuier.
But it is neceflary to discharge the pay
ers, that receipts of the Treafuter (hould
bÂ« endorsed upon warrants signed by the
Secretary, couoterigncd by the Comp
troller, and regillered by the Rt* filler,
which is the corn fe regularly obfertcd.
Answer to Question the second.
Aft-.'r monies arc deposited in banks to
the credit 'of the Treasurer, they are in
his controul ; though they may not le
gally be di'hurfed but upon warrants 06
the above description. If deposited with
out palling in the firft instance to the cre
dit of the Treasurer, the means used for
placing them in his custody and disposal
are warrants of the like kind.
Answer to Question the third.
In rcfpeA to any monies of the Unit
ed States, depolited in banks but,not pas
sed to the credit of the Treasurer, the
banks are considered as directly refporifible
to the United States ; in the cafe of de
posits to the credit of the Tieafurer, they
are refporifible in the firft instance to him,
ultimately to the United States.
Answer to Quellion the fourth.
Only two cases are recollected, in which
monies of the United States, may be con
sidered as having been deposited in bank,
without palling in the firft instance into
the account of the Treasurer. These
relate ift. to the proceeds of foreign bills
fold for the government and received by
the bank (all accounts of which ai c now
finally closed) â2d. to thefumof 200,000
dollars, being ib.t only Jam now so deposit
ed which arises from the last loan had of
the bank. It is lÂ»ft (fnbjeft to the even
tual decision of the legislature) as an off
fet against the second inftalmentof the two
million loan from the bank.
The effect: of the operation will be this
âAn interest of fix per cent payable to
the bank upon the instalment will be ex.
tingiiifhed from the 31ft Dec. last by an
.interest of 5 per cent payable tothe bank
upon the sum borrowed of itfelf and left
in deposit. And it,has Been endeavour
ed thereby to preserve consistency & re
gularity in the arrangements of the Trea
sury. The fir ft instalment by leaving in
deposit an equal sum of the proceeds of
foreign bills was considered a3 effected on
the 31ft. December 1792, though there
was not power toconfummate the payment
till some months after. Hence it becomes
tegular that each succeeding instalment
(hould be paid on the last of Dcc. of each
year. The provifwnal measure, thus a
dopted, was the only expedient in the
power of the treasury to reconcile, as far
as practicable, considerations relative to
the public interest and credit, with legali
ty of procedure. Neither the sum in de
posit on the one hand, nor the instalment
payable to the bank on the other is bro't
into the probable state of cash lately pre
sented to the House of Reprcfentatives;
because they balance each other and leave
the result the fame.
Thereare noexiftifigfources from which
monies can come into the bank on account
of the United States, except from the
proceeds of the revenue, which as far. as
known are comprized in the statement
before the House of Representatives. So
that there is no resource but a loan which
can supply the deficit of receipt in the
course of the present and fucceedipg quar
ter compared with the expenditure ; with
out one, a failure in the public payments
is inevitable.
If what has been said rtiould not give
the committee the light they desire, it is
imagined that perfonalexplanations would
lead more fully to their object, than the
course of written interrogatories and an
swers which can only partially embrace the
fubje&, and may procrastinate a right un
demanding of it.
1 am, Sir,
With cfteem and regard,
Your molt
Obedt. Servant,.
ALEX. HAMILTON.
Theodore Sedgwick, Esq.
Chairman of the Committee.
After reading this letter Mr. Sedg
wick observed, that the business as tranf
afted, in the manner stated in tlie Secre
tary's letter, was the moil beneficial pos
sible for the United States, because it
prevented any money, at any time, collec
ted for the public, lying beyond the reach
of the government and useless.
He further observed, that gentlemen
would remember, th&t it was ncceffary
not only to provide for a deficiency which
might cxiJt at the end of the current
quarter, but also for that next succeeding.
That to enable the i'eleft committee to
discharge the duty which they owed to
the house in this refpeft, it had been tho't
expedient to call on the Secretary This
they had accordingly done; acdhad ex
tended their enquiry to that period, to ful
iiil the object of their commission. That
the estimate resulting in their report, was
formed of the bell materials they couid
collect. He said, that in several particu
lars, it was probable that the estimate
might not be juitified by events. It ought
however, to be remembered, that it was
the duty of the legislature, to put the pre
servation of the pnblic credit, almost be
yond the reach of the possibility of being
injured.
The firft article he mentioned was the
deficit which would exist on the firft of
April, amounting, as clearly reported to
the House to 621,294 dollars and 18
cents â!,000,000 florins were to be paid
in Holland by the Ift of July. The com
mittee had agreed to estimate this at
400,000 dollars, though according to the
present rate of exchange it would amount
to somewhat that is about 40,000 dollart
more. Gentlemen, he said, would un
doubtedly perceive that it was for the
public interest that this object (hould be
provided for as early as possible, that ad
vantage might be taken of the occuring
circumstances so as to conduit the bufineis
moit profitably for the United Statesâ
One quarter of the interest of the public
debt was 700,000 dollarsâOne quarter
of the civil lift was estimated at 50,000'
dollars. This he took notice would amount
to somewhat more, owing to the encreafe
of the number of the members of the
LegislatureâThe remaining item men
tioned by him was the army expenditures,
estimated at 375,000 dollarsâThis article
he observed might vary more from thtf es
timate than any of the preceding. It
might rife considerably above, it might
fall considerably below. The conje&ure
would, however, be found probably not
far from the truth. The aggregate of these
several Items amounted to 2,146,294 dol
lars and 18 cents. To fatisfy this sum it
appeared by returns inthe Secretary's
office, that there would fall due of duties
on imports, and tonnage, in the months
of April, May and June, and of course in
season to face the demands which may be â 
made on the ift of July, 448,802 dollars
and 22 cents. There will also be received
in the fame period, one quarter of the an
nual duties on distilled spirits, amounting
by estimate to 100,000 dollars, which ad
ded to the returned amount of the duties
as before stated of 448,802 dollars and 22
cents, makes an aggregate of 548,802
dollars and 22 cents. This sum deducted
from the aggregate of the estimated de
mands which may become necefiary to be
difcharged.beingasbeforeftated 2,146,294
dollars and 18 cents, would leave a balancce
to be provided for by loan of 1,597,491
dollars and 96 cents.
He observed, however,that there went'
two considerations which would cenfidet
ably lefTen this balanrue. These were, lit,
that there was, a deficiency of returns of
bonded duties'; and 2,d, ,the revenue of
the present year imports and
tonnage, which would be .in fact received
previous to the ift day of JulyâThese
two articles the Secretary liad ellim'ated
ar 600,000 dollars, this lie had founded
oti his experience on this fubjett. The
committee had thought their report might
result in round numbers, departed minutely
indeed, from the Secretary's estimate by
reducing the 600,000, to 597,491. dol
lars and 96 cents, leaving according to
their report, a balance of 1,000,000 dol
lars to be provided for by*loan.
Mr. S. said it was true that all the de
mands on the Treasury might not be mads
at the precise moment they became due
It was indeed probable, that the money
due to foreigu officers in particular, might
not; but he repeated what he had before
said, that it was the duty of the Legisla
ture to put the public credit beyond the
reach of injury j and that by the report
of the feledt committee, the anthority to
borrow was only to exist in the cafe of
necessity
Mr. Sedgwick concluded by reading
from a payer he held in his hand, an ac
count according to the detail he had be
fore made and ilated.
Mr. Giles said the chairman of the fi
led* committee had made a fair, and com
prehensive ftatemer.t of the conduct of the
committee as far as he had gone; there
were however some faÂ£h, which he had
omitted, that lie thought should be com
municated. He {aid that in the course of
the committee's jnveftigatiou, it had ap
peared that the contrast contemplated by
the ast for incorporating the bank, had
been dated tither in June or July. It had
however been agreed, that it Ihould havea rctrofpe&ive effect so as to iutereft the
United States in the bant from the com
mencement of its operations. He thought
it also his duty to Itate to the committee,
though not in opposition to the report,
that it had been made a question whether
the payment of the instalments due to the
bank from the United States, {hould be
considered as falling due at the time of
the commencement of its operations, or
at the time of executing the contract.
That this queltion had been referred to
the Attorney General, who had given an
opinion in favor of the latter period. That
the Secretary notwithstanding had iiv op
position to this opinion, made the firft
payment in December, very near the time
when the bank commenced its operations,
instead of June or July, when the contract
was executed. Mr. Giles Â£ai<f he merely
stated these facts, believing the committee
{hould be acquainted with them.
Mr. S. said the facts mentioned by
the gentleman from Virginia, (Mr. Giles)
had appeared during the irtveiKgation of
the committee, and were truly stated.
That he himfelf (hould have mentioned
them, had he supposed they could have
any influence in determining the question
under confideratkjn. That when this
question was decided, he wonld bring for
ward a motion by which the huufe (hould
be officially possessed of a knowledge of
those facts. At present he would only
observe to the committee, that it was true
the contraÂ£t between the secretary and the
bank, in purfuanee of the legal provision,
was executed in June or July, that it was
by the contract agreed, that it (hould have
a retrospective operation to the time of
the commencement of the negotiations of
the bank. It ought, however, to be no
ticed that by this mean the United States
were obliged to pay an interest of fir per
cent on the amount of their fubfeription
for the time preceding the date of the
contra ft, but they were for the fame time
intereftcd in the profits of the bank, which
amounting to co'nfidcrably more than fix
per cent, the difference was a clear balance
in favor of the public. It was also to be
observed, that by paving the instalments
in December, instead of June or July, a
debt d ie from the government, bearing
an interest of fix per cent, was exchanged
for one bearing an interest of five per cent,
so that in both the instances mentioned by
the gentleman, there was a clear and ma
nifest fax ing to the United States.
The report of the feleft committee was
agreed to and adopted by the house, and
Mr. Sedgwick, Mr. Giles, and Mr. Dear
born, were directed to report a bill con
formably thereto.
Mr. Sedgwick then moved that the Se
cretary of the Treafuiy be directed to fur
nifh the honfe with a copy of the contrail
made in pursuance of the 11 th feftion of
the ast for incorporating the subscribers
to the Bank of the United States.âAf
fo, a copy of any opinion which may have
been given by the Attorney-General, re
lative to a conftruftion of the contrast,
and that he iufornr the House, of any pro
visional measures, which may have been
taken to discharge the second instalment,
due on the laid loan. This motion was
agreed to.
He next moved, that a committea be
appointed to prepare and report a bill pro
viding for the feeond instalment, due on a
loan made of the Bank of the United
This motion was aifo argreed to,
and a committee confuting of Mr. Sedg
wick, Mr. W. Smith, and Mr. Cadwalla
der, accordingly appointed.
UNITED STATES,
BOSTON, February 13,
ExtraÃ of a letter from a Member of Con*
greft, to bis friend in this town, Febru
ary 3.
" I presume you will not expect me to
close this letter, without some observati
ons on the political manoeuvres in this
quarter. My sentiments.-tin genera! prin
ciples, you know. The trite tune of anti
federal iÂ» going fed out of falhion, it now
affords but little music even to the ears of
its authors ; though they ought to rever
ence its departed (hade, for I believe it
has operated as a magic to blind the pub
lic mind, whilAneafures were maturing,
that may eventually change the original
chara&eriftic features of our government.
âThe bank and funding fyflrems will pro
bably give a call to its completion, that
the authors of the conllitutiori never con
templated. The monied mtereft unless
some changes take place, will form an ari
ftocratic influence, that will be inevitable.
This is the great line between the legislat
ive parties, whicn now stand nearly on a
poile.â Two important questions will
speedily put their strength to the test. I
mean the propositions of Madison, and the
report of the Algerine committee, which
I prefumr you have seen. The debates
on the fii ft have wholly occupied the house
for the last three weeks; and perhaps Bri
tilh interests were never more ardently ad
vocated in St. Stephen's Chapel, than
they have been in the course of the de
bates, within the walls of Congress. Ma
dison has commanded the applause even of
his enemies. The fuperficial froth of fo
norious words and harmonious periods,
vanish before the irrefiftable strength of
his reasoning."
NASSAU, (N. P.) January 10.
On Wednesday his majesty's frigate
Hufiar, commanded by Captain George,
called off her, and yesterday failed for the
coast of America.
The Hussar sent in two American
schooners, viz. the Success, Curry, and
Frederickrtnirg Packet, Anderforr, from
Philadelphia for Cape Francois, laden with
provisions. Both these vessels, we under

their cargoes here, or to proceed to fbme

PHILADELPHIA,
MARCH 4.
This day in the House of P.eprefenta
tives, Mr. Sedgwick called up the pro
posed amendment to the ConftitutioÃ of
the United States, refpefting the Suabi
lity of States, which passed the Senate
some time since.âAster some discussion
of the fubjefl, the House concurred with
the Senate, 81 Ayes, 9 Noes.
By a Baltimore paper it appears that
Port-au-Prince was summoned to fume ri
der to a Britilh squadron the second of
Januaryâthe answer received was ligrved
by M.San t hon axâthe purport of which
was, that Republicans never capitulate-
There is a report in circulation that the

Lilbon, Dec. 17, 1703.
Mr. William Bell,
Sit,
â¢ WE have just received the inclosed let
ter by a Portuguese frigate: It is we
presume from Capt. M'Shane, who had
the misfortune of being captured near the
mouth of the Streights, by an Algerine
cruiser, and carried a slave to Algiers.â
We feel very much for him (having had
the pleasure of knowing him here in the
(hip Mary Ann, owned by MefTrs. Stew
art and Barr, of Philadelphia) and all
the Americans who have fallen victims to
the datefted rovers, and it will give us
pleasure to alleviate their unfortunate situ-
ation,
We are sorry to inform you that on the
sth of Nov. the date of Capt. M'Shane's
letter, there were 120 to 130 poor Ame
ricans in slavery ; and this is not the worst,
the piratical beings came out again into
the Atlantic the 29th ult. in feareh of
more plunder, and we fear they will do
further mifchief. Their cmiling now it
contrary to their old fyltem of retiring
from the ocean in November, and coming
out in April ; bnt they never did much
harm to the PortUgnefe, for lince our re
sidence in this city, half a century, they
captured but 3 brigs, one (hip, and 3 or
4 fchooners,and carried them into Algiers.
We hope the United States wiUfoon efta
blilh a force to keep those pirates from e
ver entering the Atlantic again.
We suppose that you have been inform
ed thai this Court and Spain grant con
voys to your flag, as well as those of the
Hanfe Towns. Our letters from Gibral
tar dated the zsth.uk. advise that a Portu
guese frigate had taken under her pro
tection 6 Americans, to fee them to the
wfftward, out of danger.
This opportunity of Capt. Stafford, to
Baltimore, not allowing us more time to
enlarge,
We remain, &c.

this citv
Dear Sir,
I have to inform you that on the jctfr
of August, we were boarded by the Gu!-
loden, an Engli(h 74, who pressed the
chief mate (Andrew TuUock) and three
of our men ( Edward Kerr and William
Brown, the other's name 1 have forgot)
being Englilhmen, and sent in ont man
and two boys instead of them. The man's
name is Mott, and has a family in Nor
folk, Virginia ; the boys' names are Bur
gis ?nd Smith, apprentices to Captain
Conyngham of fame place, who wi(h their
friends to know where they are.âWe had
light winds and calms with 2 5 days of east
erly winds on the ooafl, which was the
cause of our long passage. After having
run the gauntlet with two frigates, on the
iSth October, about 5 leagues from Gi
braltar, we were boarded by a zebecque
of 20 guns, belonging to this place, who
after coming within mulket-fhot, kept up
a constant firing with small arms, until
they manned our yards frcm theirs, then
the firing ccafed, and they came down
iword in hand, spared our lives but nothing
else, having {tripped us of the clothes we
had on, and put us on board the zebecque,
which brought us to this place on the 30th
ult. when we wire taken before the Dey,
from thence to the Banyon where the
Haves are kept locked up at night: next
day we were all sent to the marine and
kept at hard labor from day light to dark,
with an iron chain which reaches from our
legs to our hips ; about yclb. weight, and
treated with great severity by aur afters,
who allow us nothing but bread and water
for ot'.r fubfiftance. The wheel-barrow
men in your city lived a genteel life to
what ws do,
Our fitutation is truly (hockingâand
how long we can exist, God only knows.
The caipcnter, John M'FarTane, a Scotch
man, was taken out of the marine, by the
British Consulâthe fail-maker, John Fo
gereatix, and two Spaniards, G. Romeo
and B. Gazona, were fold at pnblic auc
tion. On the evening of the lame day
I arrived litre, the following mailers with
their crews were brought inâCaptains
Wallace, Virginia - r Newman, Boflon ;
Taylor, Rhode-Island ; Furnace, New-
Hamplhire; Calder.Glouccfter; Burnham,
New-York - T . Bailey, Newbury j Moss,
Ditto; Penrofe, Philadelphia.
The whole number ef Americans is be
tween izo or 130, they treat the Dutch
in the fame manner they do us.â-Captain
O'Brlan and Stephens, with their crews
are here, 10 of them are living, the reft
dead.âlf their fmalf number could not
be redeemed we have no hopes of relief,
therefore endeavour to make ourselves as
happy as poflible : they a(k for my ransom
4000 dollars, firft and second mate, 3000
dollars each, and for each man, 1500 dol
lars. If a peace is not made, or our fhlpj
protefled, we may expect to encreafe dai
ly, as we are all employed in the marine
department, fitting out cruizerSi I have
not yet learned their force, but as there
is no cheek on them, no American veflel
will be able to go to Europe in fafety. A
courier is arrived from Alicant, informing
the Dey that Col. Humphrey's is there
with full power from Congress, to make
a peace, and waits his permifiion to come,
but the Dey I am informed, had refufed
him.
I remain
