Mr. Steinberg, his ftajeftey's Chemirt
at Hanover, has pointed out a process,
by boiling coal with allum, to obtain a
liquid of a deep blue color, which will
serve to blue writing paper; or give to pa
per the coljr of foreign sugar-piper.
For the Gazette of the United States
Queries, rtJpeÃing certain Stlf-JiileA
Patriots.
I. Who are the moll liable to the charge
of foreign influence, those who endeavor t6
avoid a war by negociation, and prepare
the country for it, if neceflavy j or those
who endeavor to plunge the country into
a war, unpicpaied, and at the fame time
obftrutt all the measures of preparation
and defence ?
2. If war (hould overtake us unprepar
ed, without an army, without revenue,
and before our harbors are fortified, or
our arsenals replenilhed, must we not ei
ther fall a prey to the vindittive spirit of
Great Britain, or become the humble sup
plicants td, and dependants on France for
protection ?
3- If such will be the confluence,
have we not reason to fufpeft that those
who are inclined to reduce at to that dis
graceful dilemma, are stimulated by fo
reign influenceâif they wi(h to fee us
humbled by Great Britain, are they not
emilTaries and tools of that nationâif
they with to place us under the prote&ion
of France, are they not the mercenary
agents of France ?
4. If to be in a condition to defend
ourselves, to protest our commerce, and
preserve our neutral rights, it be necefla
ry to build frigates, to fortify our ports,
to fill our arsenals, and provide troops, do
not those who withhold the means neces
sary for the carrying these meafiires into
execution expose the country to invalion,
our towns to deftruftion, our veflels to be
captured, our fellow-citizens to be carri
ed into ignominious bondage, and our
neutral rights to be violated ?
r. â Y
y. Money being the means, the fine qua
non of those measures, do not those who
refute to grant money, oppose the execu
tion of those measures ?
6. Profeflions and fine promises being
frequently made when there is no inten
sion to fulfil them and coding nothing,
ought the public to be deceived by these
profeflions, when they fee the authors of
them caviling at every kind of revenue
and endeavoring by indirect means to de
feat it !
7- When we hear men puhlickly aflert
that they are friends to public credit and
to the support of government, and are
willing to grant all the revenues nece(T:iry
for bothâwhen they acknowledge that
revenues are wanted, and when we find
them strenuously oppofiug every source of
revenue which is proposed, is there
incontellible proof that their profefllons
are a mere parade of words, which can
not impose even upon the raoft ignorant ?
8. If an inspection of the Journals of
a certain House, manifeftly fhews'that a
ctrtain set of men, have uniformly and
unitedly voted againfl every species of re
venue proposed, is there not a ft rang pre-,
sumption that jheir views are sinister, their
politics hostile to the independence of the
United States, and that instead of the
confidence they merit the indignation of
every true American ?

been repeatedly charged with being with

jutl:fy all the charges of your enemies,

Are theie the methods to increase your

A deluded party *may pull down the

Copy of a letter from Colonel Whitlock,
Commander in Chief, to Mr. Lavkux
Commandant at Port de Paix.
Jereraie, 9th February, 1794.
Sir,
If I am not mifinformed, concerning your
present situation, it is such that you will not
be surprized at receiving this letter. You
cannot but be fully acquainted with the in
tentions of his Britannic Majesty, to use the
moll vigorous efforts to take pofleflion of
the Island of St. Domingo, or of that part
of it which is not yet subdued by the arms
of Spain. I hourly expect considerable for
ces from England j the army under tny
command has lately been confiderably.rein
forced.
I doubt not but you have also been in
formed, that all the members of that party
of the National Convention of France, who
had (anrtioned the measure for fending to
St. Domingo, civil Commiflioners, who are
looked upon as the cause of the total ruin of
the island, have for that crime fuffered an
ignominious death.
Briflot, the leader of that party, was ac
cused of three capital crimes, the firft of
which is, that he advised the measure of
fending hither civil Commiflioners.
The unhappy state of France, rendering
it impraflicable for that nation to fend suc
cours to this ill-fated country, several of the
moll refpe&able proprietors of St. Domingo,
were forced to apply to England for protec
tion ; which was accordingly granted to
them.
I now therefore, in the name of his Bri
tannic Majesty, do hereby offer to you the
fame protefiion, on condition that you shall
firft deliver the town and forts of Port de
Paix and its dependencies into the possession
of the British government, which being com
plied with, the officers and loldiers Serving
under your command, shall enjoy the fame
favors as have been granted to those of the
Mole, leaving it to the bounty of his Majesty
to grant to yourfelf the rank he lhall judge
proper. I further add, that as a reward for
the confidence which I demand of you in the
name of the government which I serve, the
sum of five thousand pounds sterling, mak
ing fifty thousand crowns (ecus) Tournois,
(hall be paid to you in person, ordepofited in
the Bank of England, payable to your order,
on your delivering the town of Port de Paix,
with the forts, artillery, ammunition, provi
sions, &c. &c. without any damage or devas
tation having been committed to them, into
the hands of the officer whom I will appoint
to receive them, as also the (hips of war
which may be in the said port. I fliall be
at Leogane next Wednesday, where any flag
of truce you shall please to fend me, lhall
be received and refpe<3ed.
I have the honor to fend you inclosed, the
extra<sl of an Enjlifli Gazette, which has
b<*n Cent to all the Englift commanding
officers.
I have the honor to be, Sir,
Your very humble and
very obedient servant,
Whitlock, Commander in Chief.
Anfsver of Lavaux Governor General per
interim.
Port de Paix, Feb. 13, 1794.
2d year ofthe Fiench Republic.
The probity, the delicacy which reign
in the breast of a French Republican must
ever have given yon full a durance that we
would refpeft your flag of truce. French
generality does not fluctuate with events.
As amongst us no peifon is diftinguiftied
as a superior, we all doing the duty of a
soldier ; I looked upon your letter to me
as addrefled to thefirit soldier of the army,
and as I conceal nothing from my com
rades, it was opened and read publicly.
We are animated by one and the fame
spirit of defence. You tell me that you
will have at Jean Rabel a fufficient number
of men for the execution of whatever plan
I may do you the honor to propose. The
whole army has no other plans but those
neeeflary for a vigorous defence. You
propose to fend a ship of war into the ca
nal, you may fend her as soon as you please,
we are ready to give her a manly reception.
You further inform me that all possible
care (hall be taken to secure to me every
thing belonging to me. You need not
give yourfelf that trouble. My booty is
that of the soldiers; we wear the fame
uniform ; in this I glory; our food is the
fame, and hence I enjoy good health.â
You tell me the molt honorable attention
will be paid to my person : I take you
for a man of honor and sentiment, as
such how could you honor a commander
who had betrayed his country and fold hit
brethren in arms ! Wifbing to pieferve to
me all that belongs to me you would take
from me my honor, the only property of
which I am covetous, which I will carry
with me to my grave, and which will for
ever secure to me the esteem of the Eng
lifti. You aflure me that all the officers
and troops of the line will be received in
to the pay of Great Britain on the fame
footing as those of Dillon. To this, I
answer in the name of the whole army,
that were to barter our honor for a bit of
bread. We are not yet famifhing and we
all swear to you that we will never betray
our country, and if we cannot make you
love us, at lead we will force you to esteem
Us.
I greet you in the name of all the ar.

" The young, charming, and tender
wife of M. Loyer, accompanied her hus
band to the place of execution, and there
haranged the soldiers : It was I," (he ex
claimed, " who solicited, pfonjpted my
husband to take up arms Death is all I
alk of you; 1 alone am guiltyâSave him !"
Saying that, (he covered with her body
that of her husband, and bathed him with
her tears; but all in vain ! They threw
her down from the fcoffold, and executed
her husband. Arrived at her house, (he
destroyed herfelfin a fit of despair.. The
wife of M. Saare also destroyed hcrfelf in
the Rhone, on the very fame day her hus
band was executed.
" The conduit of M. Cudel de Mont
coulon, a young man of 20 years of age,
and nephew of M. de Prelfe, de'ferves the
highest praise, and forced even his enemies
to admire his courage. Fired with enthu
siasm, he mounted the fcaffold, and ad
drefied himfelf to the soldiers and the peo
ple.
" A few who acted a distinguished
part with our firft Revolutionills have (bar
ed a similar fate ; among these are, Mila
nois, an Ex Conllituent of the left 11 dc;
tlie Curate Servier, Ex President of the
Central Club ; Pnvat, Bcc. &c. who have
been guillotined ; and Abbe Rosier, Cu
rate of St. Polycarpe, and author of sever

the siege was killed in his bed by the burst

Et. Lavaux.
" All kinds of religious worship is a
bolilhed. The churches are changed into
(tables and barracks. Jolv Clerc Curate
of St. Nizier, in his lad sermon informed
his pariihoners, that for the future no pub
lic worship could be permitted, and that
knowing the catechism was fufficient.
This detestable Pricft fled during the siege
to Dubois Cranee, re-entered the town
with him, and has just placed the bull of
the infamous Challier on the altar of the
church,
" All the accounts which the newf
pnpers have given of the feitival celebrated
in honor of this a drvant feboo'mafter arc;
erroneous: The following is an authentic
description of this farce.
" On the loth instant all the Conflitut
ed Authorities, the Revolutionary Tribu
nal, the troops of the line. &c. repaired
with an ass to the Townhoufe. There
this animal was decked with the dole, and
all the other fuberb farerdotal ornaments
which the Count de Maubourg had made
a present of to the Cathedial. On his
head was put the beautiful Mitre of the
Bishop I,Amourette ; on his back were tied
the holy veflels, and to his tail a mass book.
He was decorated with the inscription,
Rejlcs d- Fanatifme, Remains of Fanati
cism. Thus equipped, the ass was led in
procefiion through the whole town, pro
ceeded by the Department and a detach
ment of horse, and followed by a band of
music and some infantrv By his fide
marched two Sans Culottes holding 3
calix, (sacred cnp)out of which the ani
mal drank now and then, ?.nd two other
Sans Culottes perfumed with him frankin
cenfe. The Muncipality,the Tribunals,
the Clubifts, and women clad in white,
closed the proceflion. Having arrived at
the Place de Bellecour, they piled up
church pictures, books of devotion, bibl<js,
mass books, and luch church ornamentsas would fetch no money when exposed to
sale ,an'd burnt the ass, books &c. 4c. &c.
under the raoft hotrid shouts Vive Satis
Culottes.
" The demolition of the town advances
With incredible rapidity. All the build
ings which graced our quays, from the
Gate of St. Clair to that of Peyrothe on
the Rhone, and from the Gate of Serin
to the Place of Bellecour on the SaonÂ«,
are doomed to deflruftion. The magnifi
ciont Place de Bellecour is already a heap
of ruins. All the houses in the interior
of the town, of a splendid or genteel ap
pearance, are to (hare the fame fate, viz.
that ofTolozon,ai the Pietre; of Parent,
<it the Herbiere ; of Piron, in the New
ftreet,&c. &c.
" All the inhabitants, even women, are
compelled to work at those demolitions. A
number of young people m : j< among the
demolifhers, in order to avoid all suspicion
against "their Sans Culottifm ; and above 100
young men have enlisted in the regiment of
huflars who are marching againll Toulon,
to escape from the guillotine.
" Famine begins to be severely /tit ; pro
visions of all kinds are extremely scarce. The
farmers have sown as much corn as poflible,
that it may not be taken from them at the
rate of the maximum. All the markets are
empty, and the Commifiioncrs sent by the
Convention to buy up corn in the country
have run the greatest dangers at Tournes.
" The other neighboring towns bear the
fame desolated afpeft. The Department is
moved from Feurs, in the diftridt of Mont
brifon, to Boen. Several distinguished citi
zens of Montorifon have been executed, and
much fear is entertained on account of Meflrs.
Ponoing, Curaife, Roficrs, Atlard, and Mau
bau, who on the 27th of September were
takert prisoners in an a&ion with the ban
ditti.
" Thlre are scarce to be found in the
whole town of Lyons fix persons who bear
the appearance of a Bourgeois. All are im
prisoned, and even the charitable Nuns, who
took a particular care of the sick and wound
ed Republicans, are not excepted from the
general doom. The refpe&able M. dc Meaux,
ci denmnt Lieutenant General of Montorifon,
after having obtained his liberty at Lyons,
has again been thrown in prison in his own
country, M. de St. Hilaire pines in the dun
peon of Ambert; Bryeres, the Counts of
Bryonfe and Marity, wi'h four Clergymen,
are also confined 5 M. Charles and his son
are condemned to death, but their execution
is ordered to be performed at Paris ; they
have been offered, it is said, to redeem them
selves with a sum of 20,000 livres.
" The whole country groans under the
curse of revolutionary search warrants, by
means of which the honfes are plundered,
and ail property destroyed. The spoils are
tarried off into Auvergne."

PORTSMOUTH-, [N. H.] April 30.
On Monday lad arrived here, the fchr.
Industry, Samuel Lanphear, in 25 days
from New-ProvidenceâCapt. Lanphear
informs, that there had not been one A
meriean reffel condemned at that place.â
Left there Captain Billings, in a schooner
belonging to Bolton, who was to fail in a
few days.âCaptain Higby, in a schooner
belonging to New-York, Capt. Grafton
i" a schooner from Salem, and Captain-
Sturges in a schooner from Bolton, failed

The schooner Patty from Boflon, was
carried into Port Paix by a French priva
teer, who took her cargo, and was to
give them a generous price therefor, with
out detaining her a moment longer than
they could unload and receive their pay.
Capt. Lanphear saw a Capt. of a ves
sel, who left Cape Francois in March,
who informed him that Flour was actually
Four Joes a barrel when he left there.
PHILADELPHIA,
MAY 15.
It has ever been admitted that owing to
the ignorance and avarice of some of the
AVeft-India Judg s, condemnations of Ame
rican vefitis have taken place on the infiruc
tior.s of the 6th November ; and, in a few
instances after the arrival of the counter
inflru&ions of the Bth January, in one of
the islands: But they had been of vellels
taken and libelled under the firft mftniflions.
All this has been admittedâand more than
this is not true.
There is a letter in town, dated, Paris,
March 12, which fays that that City and
the Armies have bread enough to fubftft
on until next harvest. The capital expe
riences a scarcity bf rfleat, which is not
surprising, considering, that a great por
tion of that article forthe supply of Pa
ris was formerly raised in that part of the
Republic now called La Vendee, which
has been totally laid wa.'ke to facilitate the
extirmination of the royahlls.
By this Day's Mail.
ExtraS of a letter frrm Newport, received
per the Packet Aurora,, Captain Jafcn
Cahoon 'y dated May 10.
" 011 Thursday lall arrived here, from
St. Lncii, the Britilh floopof war, called
the Nautilus, Captain Baynton, with
the governor of the island and his suite,
who had capitulated to be landed in Ame-
rica. Early in the day it was rumoured,
that a number of imprefled American sea
men were on board, and detained there
against their inclinations. The inhabit
ants, after ascertaining the faÂ£l, were much
eScalprrated, and very earnest that some
immediate measures might be taken for
their release. Fortunately the legifiature
of the (late were in feflion, in this town ;
on representation of the circumstance to
them, the fheriff was directed to request
the Captain and Lieutenant (thenon shore)
together with the Consul, to wait on the
legifiature.
In the interim, the supreme judiciary
of the state were convened, and a commit
tee of the honfe appointed to wait on the
gentlemen as they approached the flate
houfe, to inform them of the business for
which their company was requested ; with
a view that fbme conciliatory steps might
be taken at an early period to prevent any
disagreeable consequences: On the com
mittee's representation, Capt. B. with the
most supercilious air (the true chara&erif
tic of the British nation) turned ofF and
very laconically observed," he knew of no
Americans on board his {hip, neither should
he take any measures in the business," on
which the committee begged leave to in
troduce him to the court, who were autho
rized to make due enquiry into the fads.
The Captain, with the importance of a
Mogul of the east, treated the court with
the utmoll contempt; they, on the con
trary, with the greatest coolness, endea
vored to reason with him, and proposed
that a committee from the town fliould
accompany the consul on board the ship,
and examine the crew ; and if any Amc- -
ricans should be found on board, that they
might be released ; he, in the most pe
remptory manner, refufed, observing, 'that
it was beneath the dignity of his Britan
nic majesty's ship to be searched.
After being detained some time, they
attempted an escape, and made their way
from the council chamber to the foot of
the flairs ; but the vigilance of the citi
zens soon convinced them it was moll ad
vifeable to return. On finding that the
court and legislature were determined they
(hould be detained till the Americans, if
any on board, were released, he, with re
luctance, consented to the measure. Ac
cordingly, a committee of five True Re
publicans, accompanied the Britilh con
lul on board the Nautilus; and, after a
thorough investigation, found fix Ameri
can seamen, anxious to be restored to their
country.
Another difficulty arose refpe&ing their
wages, which the Capt. refufed to pay,
except fcjr a pay order; finally, the consul
agreed to accept the order for the balan
ces which were due Thus the business,
commencing at 4 o'clock P. M. was con
cluded with honor to the legislature, at
half part one in the morning, they hav
ing, with true republican firmnefs and una
nimity, adhered to their resolution of de
taining the two officers until the seamen
fliould be released and paid.
Some of our ariftocratical gentry may
fay, ' that the legislative interference was
unwatrantable but the particular emer
gency required it, and would, on every
principle, juftify it ; and many do not he
sitate to afiart, ' that their release would
not have been effected, had not the legifla
turebeen in feflion.' /
The Capt, has since kept on board the
(liip, and given out, ' that a reprefi-ntation
of the insult fliould be made to the British
minister!'

AN ESSAY ON THE
Natural Equality of Men,
On the Rights that result from it, and oil the
Duties whicli it imposes.
To which a MEDAL was adjudged, by the
Ttyierian Society at Haarleifl.

By WILLIAM LAWRENCE BROWN,
Profeflor of Moral Philofopby, and the Law
<>t Nature, and of Ecclef.aftical History ;
and Minister of the Eugliih Church at U-

Aliquid Temper ad corainunem utilitatem at
fcrcm'um Cicero.
The Firjl American Edition.
THE grand principle of Equality, if right
ly under flood, is the onLy basis on which
uoiverfai justice, sacred order, and pertett
freedom, can be firmly built, and permanent
ly secured. The view of it exhibited in this
eiTay, at the fame time that it reprefles the
iftfolence of office, the tyranny of pride, and
the outrages of oppression ; confirms, in the
most forcible manner, the ne<eflity ol subor
dination, and the just demands of lawful au
thority. So far indeed, from loosening the
baads of society, that it maintains inviolate,
,every natural and every civil diftin&ion,
draws more clol'ely every facial tie, unites in
one harmonious and justly proportioned sys
tem, and brings men together on the even
ground of the inherent rights of human na
ture, of reciprocal obligation, aud oi a com
mon relation to the community.

The Public are cautioned to
beware of counterfeited Five Dollar Bills of
the Bank of the United Statu, and Twenty
Dollar Bills of the Bank of North 'America,
several of ivhicb have appeared in circulation
'within Â« /Â«u days fact ; they are a good ge
neral imitation of the genuine bills, but m.iy
be dijling uifbed by the following
MARKS.
Five Dollar Bills of the Bank of the
United States.
ALL tjiat have appeared have the lettfcr F.
for their Alphabetitpl Mark.
The Texture of the Paper is thicker and
whiter and it takes the ink more .freely than
the genuine paper.
The O. in the word Company is smaller
than theM. and other letteis of that word,
so that a line extended from the top of the O,
to touch the top of the M would extend con
fide! ably above the range of the whole word.
In the word United the letters are narrow
erand closer together than the reft of the bill
The * and fin the word promise are not
parallel, the yinclining much more forward
>Â»n the Â»,
The engraving is badly executed,the ftiokes
of all the Letters are stronger and the devi-e
in the margin particularly is much coarser and
appears darker than ip the true bills. Some
at the counterfeits bear date in 1791 âWhere-
as the Bank was not in Operation till Decern
ber, and no five dollar bills were iilWd in
jhat year.
TUuenty Dollar Bills of fbe Bank of North
America.
ALL that have appeared have the letter
B. for their alphabetical mark.
They are printed on a paper nearly similar
to that of the counterfeit Five Dollar Notes
above described ; the engraving is bcttei exe
ucted, and they approach nearer to the ap
pearance of the genuine bills.
TlÂ»e fine ruled hues through the word Twen
/v, in the body of the bill, are in number thir
teen in the genuine b*lis, and but twelve in
ihe counterfeits.
The word Company is much like the fame
word in the Five Dollar Bills as defer ibed a
bove, the o being less than the m % and others
fallowing.
There is no stroke to the t in the word North
whereas in the genuine bills the stroke is well
defined.
The letters cut in the word Twenty, to the
left hand at the bottom, do not come down to
the line, but ate to cut as to give an trregulai
appearance to the word, the Tar and go-
ing below them.
The signature {. Nixon, has the appear
ance ot ocing written wiih Uwbrblack. aud
oil, and differs from other inks uled in
printing the bills and the cathier's signature.
It is supposed thele forgeries were committed
in tome of the Southern States, as ail the coun-
erfeits thai have appeared, have come from
thencr, aud two peiions have been apprehend
ed in Virginia,on suspicion of being the author
of thein.
The reward of ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS
will beÂ«patd to any Perfou or Persons who ihall
difcovci and prosecute to conviÂ£l:on the several
offenders of the following def<*iiptions or any
of them, viz.
The pcrfon or persons, who manufactured
the Â£apcr on which the Bills arc primed.
The perioo or persons, who engraved ihÂ»
plates.
The printer or printers, of the bills.
Evety perfoo who has adted as a principal
any other way, in the counterfeiting and uttei
mg the (aid bills.
Philadelphia, March 28, 1794
Other counterfeit bills
of the Bank of the United States have appears
in ciiculation.
The de ik) mi nation is of TWENTY DOL
LARS,and the alphabetical mark is the let
ter B.
They may be distinguished from the genu |
ine by the following MARKS :
The paper of the counterfeits is of a more
tender texture and glofley lurface than the
genuine, and there is no water mark in.them.
The letter C. in the word Cafhirfr, in the
true bills is strongly marked, whereas in the
counterfeits, the whole letter is a fine hair
stroke, evidently in an unfiniflied liate. The
letter a in the word demand, is badly formed
and the whole word ill done, and there is no
comma at the end of it, as the>e is in the
genuine bills.
The marginal device, is much daiker in
the falfe, than in the genuine bills owing to
the (hade strokes being coarfei, much nearer
together, and conletjueutly much more nu
merous. This difference strikes the eye at firft
view.
. The fame reward of ONE THOUSAND
DOLLARS, will be paid for appi &
profecoting to convi&ion the fevcral above
described Offenders in refpeft to this, as to
tbs last described bills-

Charlotte, a tale of Truth,
IN TWO VOLUMES.
By Mrs. ROWSON, of the New Theatre
Phladelphia, Author of Victoria, the Inl
qurlitor, the Fille de Chambre, &c.
Of Charlotte, the Reviewers have given
the fallowing charaSer.
IT ma) be a Tale of Truth, for it is not
unnatural, and it is a talc of real dittrefsâ
Charlotte, bj the artifice of a teachei , recom
mended to a school, from rather
than a convi6l ion o( her integrity, or the re
gularity of her former conduct, is enticed
from her governess, and accompanies a young v
>fncer to America.âThe marriage ceremo
ny, if noi forgotten, i< postponed, ano Char
lotte dies a martyr to the incouftancy of the
over, and treachery of his friend âThefitu-
tions are artless and affe&ingâthe defcrip
ations natural and pathetic; we toould fee
for Charlotte if such a person ever existed,
who for one er.or scarcely, perhaps, deserved
Jo severe a puni/hment. If it is a fiction,
poetic justice is not, we think, properly dis
tributed
