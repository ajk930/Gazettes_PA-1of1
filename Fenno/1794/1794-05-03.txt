ExtraS of a Letter from New-Jersey,
dated April 28, 1794.
1 have just returned from my Eastern
Tour where I arranged my business with
my friend. L to our mutual fatiffac
tion, arid tefl night had the pleasure of your
favor of the 27th. " The political ho
rizon has indeed cleared up," and the
storm which seemed to gather so fa ft a
round is happly dispelled. I partake in
the general fatiffaftion which the firm and
temperate conduct of the Executive has
given. With the exception of one or two t
grumblersâl found the appointment of a
special Envoy universally agreeable. It
breathes the cool determination which the
best interests of our country require, and
which is very much in unison with the
temper of the people I have just left.â
The appointment offo eminent a chara&er
as Mr. Jay, whose talents are so well
known and refpeftcd in Europe, is conG
dered as giving energy to the measure,
and will impress the British Cotirt with
the necessity of paying immediate atten
tion toademand so folrtinly made. A sin
cere desire to avoid the horrible mifchrefs
of war, and a determination to insist ort
and enforce every important right, is really
the true line of eondu& for every Govern,
ment. This seems the prevailing disposi
tion where I have been ; and that cool and
manly republicanism which lately I have
met with, forms a fine contrast to that
frothy patriotifrrl which evaporates : in rioife
and declamation and which is too common
among some Â«f our friends.
lam glad to find that the refohe-mania
begins to abate in Congress. Our mem
bers appear to be as deeply infe&ed with
it as uhy. To b ! e the author of a resolution
has of latebeen avery prevailing ambition,
which has given birth to such a variety of
motionsâamendmentsâpostponementsâ
&c. tliat one is pUzzled to comprehend
them. We hear of Mr. B's motion, Mr.
C's motion, Mr. D's motion, aud (0 on
through half the alphabet: and yet so un
lick'd have these things been, that they
may well be compared to " half formed in
fe&s on the banks of the Nile." This rapid
production and changeable variety of mo
tions, may, however I ftippofe be more
justly ascribed to that warm refeptment,
which every American felt on the news
of the Brftifh spoliations ; but public coun
cils are not the places for resentment, un
tempered by prudence.
1 * /O
CONGRESS.
liaujc of RjprcfenUitivct April 2J.
Tuelday, April 29;
Afttr re-'Sirg Pime private petitions,
tbe hoyfe refurned the confideiation of
.tlic report fibin the committee upon the
contested CicÂ£tio. 1 of Mr. Francis Preston,
â from" theftate of Virginia.
Mr. Tiigge, and Mr. Preston spoke
Â«aches them for some time to the merits
of the cafe.
Mr. Scott then roseâhe declared that
of all the qneftions which had ever come
before that holife, the present was to him
the moil wonderful. To tell us, that an
elfftion had been overruled by a party of
soldiers, was indeed extraordinary. Up
on such an outrage, it was inoil astonish
ing that the whole country did not rife as
One mail to resent and punifl) it. But for
his own part he favy the business in an op
posite point of viewâhe could not for his
ioul difeover the smallest pretence to set
aside the election of Mr. Piefton; nor
could he comprehend or conceive upon
what ground so strange a notion had
been darted. As for Captain Prcfton,
brother to the fitting member, whose con
dudt had been so loudly excepted against,
Mr. Scott said that his behavior at the
election was that of a sage. Instead of
the fire of youth, he had discovered all
the moderation that could have been ex
. peftedfrotn the charafler of a philefopher 1 .
As to the introdu&ion of soldiers at the
â¢ . election, he saw no harm in it. They
had a right to be there, for they weie
, equally entitled with other American ci
tizens to give their votes in the choice of
a representative. The quarrel that suc
ceeded was accidental; and did not aflfedt
the question before the House. Mr. Scott
was ready, and had long been so, to give
his voice for dismissing the petition of Mr,
Trigge. He had not the smallest (hadow
of doubt upon the matter.
Mr. Macon was of the fame opinion.
It had been asserted that in this cafe, the
laws of Virginia had been violated. He
would be glad to know what law.
Mr. W. Smith considered it as a very
clear point that the election was not a fair
one; because it was evident that the peti
tioner had not enjoyed an equally fair
chance, as the fitting nitmbpf. Tt .was
true that some faÂ£ts in the petition had
not been completely substantiated, but ma
ny had. The House had been told that
hearsay testimony was unworthy of atten
tion, but he wished to remind them, that
they were not like.a court of law, reftrift
' ed to proceed upon a regular proof, and
not to go beyond the letter of itâThey
were entitled to hear and weigh every thing
advanced, and to form their opinion from
the general convidkion arising upon the
whole of the circumttances. Some fads
of the most unwarrantable kind had come
out. Three of Captain Preston's soldiers
guarded the dooT of the court-house, where
the election was held. When a person,
since examined as an evidence, wanted to
- go in, they flopped him with this questi
on, " are you to vote for Trigge ?" Up
on answering yes, they repliedâ" By
Jesus then you (hall notand though he
was fifty-eight years of age, two of them
laid holdof him and cast him to the ground:
when he got up again he went off. Mr.
Smith said that there was a clear collusion
between Captain Preston and the soldiery.
Here Mr. Preston interrupted him by de
claring that there was no such thing in the
evidenceâMr. Smith affirmed that there
was.
The was then dire&ed to read
part of the examination of the witnesses
the particulars above stated appeared in
the proof, and Mr. Smith infifte<} that
they contained a demoilftration of colfu
five measures between the fitting member,
his brother Captain Preston and the mili.
tary. It was objected to Mr. Smith, on
the part of the soldiers, that they had on
ly said they could, not that they would
knock down Mr. Trigge's voter. But
Mr. Smith considered this critical distinc
tion as minute and trifling f rom the lips of
a soldier in liquor. He did not unde r stand
Jts accuracy, and he imagined that his own
nerves must have been as much affeded by
the could as by. the mould. Many of the
country people Had expressed much difla
tisfaÂ£hon with the soldiers. It was prov
ed when the fray began, Captain
jetton had wished to have twenty of his
loldiers there, and this hint was no sooner
given, than a person ran off and immedi
atcly returned with a party of them
i Mr. Shcrbourne was for supporting the
fitting member. He wijhea that tnÂ£ time
of the House might not be fquaridercd in
ait uftlefs display of elorjuence ; it was, to
be fiire, very agreeable to speaker him
felf, bat at the fame time very fuperfluous
in regard to his audience.
The clerk was again ordered to read
some passages in the proof, as far as they
rdpeftet! the behavior of Capt. Preftdn.
Mr. W. Smith then rose a second time.
As a member of the committee that had
been ehofen upon this buiinefs, he was
1 entitled to vindicate their report, of which
Ihe read some extratis very unfavorable 4o
the behavior oi the soldiers. Mr. Smith
observed that Mr. Fretton, in his defence
1 had been extremely profufe of his censure
on the committee, for doing what they
couftdered to be their duty. Mr. Smith,
referring to the observations of Mr. Sher
bourne, said that he was perfectly in order
1 for defending the report of the committee,
because it was juftified by the facts. Tho'
the quarrel between the soldiers and the
1 country people did not happen till after
the poll, yet Hill it arose from bad blood
before,the poll began, and tlterefore a re
ference to it was firiftly in order. Mr.
Smith said that it wa9 no part of his in
-1 tention to injure the character of Captain
Preston, who, when the tumult began,
took off ljis sword, and gave it to some
person to held. For this moderation,
Capt. Preston deserved credit. But still
Mr. Smith considered himfelf as juftified
in oppoling the election, since it was not
conducted with that firmnefs, that regula
rity, and that equality of chances, requi
site upon republican principles.
He read a quotation from Blackftone,
as to elections, "Violent interposition"
fays that writer " what is it, but to cut
government up by the roots,and poison the
fountain of public security?" He dwelt,
at some length, on this idea, and on the
peculiar impropriety of military interposi
tion, he said that upon the whole, Mr,
Preston had only a majority of ten votes,
and when the circumstance of fixfy or se
venty soldiers driving off the voters of Mr.
Ttigge was opposed to such a narrow ma- '
jori/y, could any body call this tranfaftion
legal? (At the words ten "votes, Mr. Smith
was twice interrupted, firft by Mr. Mac on,
and next by Mr. Smith of Maryland, but
he perfillcd in his assertion.) He had flat
_ ~prnmÂ»lÂ»n - Â» Â»â  Â» - â
Shall the Houft fuffer an officer, the bro
ther of a candidate, to seize the door of
a court-house, and turn away the voters
of his brother ? It had been said that it
was customary, in that part of the coun
try for a candidate to collect his friends,
and block up doors, but surely it was a
very improper cullom. The fitting mem
ber had said that if his brother made any
wrong step, he should have been prosecut
ed in a court of law. Mr. Smith did not
mean to fay that Captain Preston had com
mitted any offence worthy of that, he did
not perhaps imagine that he was doing any
wrong at all. It had been asked, was it
poflible that sixty or seventy unarmed sol
diers could overawe two or three hundred
people ? He thought it possible.
Mr. S. Smith of Maryland defended
Mr. Preston. He said that in foinung
an impartial judgment npon this question,
various circumstances mud be taken into
consideration, besides the facts in evidence
before the house. In Elections of East
ern States, the citizens met in small bodies;
and they conducted the business with that
order-and decency which became the true
Republican chara&er. But it was the
miffortune of Southern States, that their
citizens assembled in large bodies the
ele&ors of a county meet all together
before the fheriff, and give their votes
at the fame time. Hence it appears, as
the matter was described by Mr. S. Smith
that an election in the Southeru States is
often productive of very great mif
-5 , He , fald that was somewhat
Vi?o â¢ hear,n g another member (Mr
W. Smith) express so much refentmtnt
at an eleSwn not. The gentleman had
access to the history of a certain eUaion,
where the very chancellor of a court of
jnllice, bred a riot in his own court, for
the express purpose of serving his party.
Much had been said about the enormity
ot knocking down a jufticeÂ«f the peace :
and m the report the affair was stated as
Â«f the magistrate had been at the court
âÂ°e -â V" J"Â® Â°Â® c,al opacity Â» Now
Sir, said Mr. Smith, Â«in this part of
>t the report is not fair. The justice
âÂ° f P eace " as ""t there in his official ca
Â« WaS there drunk Sir, and ,
he gave the firft blow Sit, to the man
; " who knocked him down." Mr. Smith
had by the firft accounts of this election,
been very much prejudiced against the
ele&ion of the fitting member. But
when' lie came to examine closely into
the bulinefs, he declared that he had nev
er known an election in the southern states
where there was so little mifchief. He
was sorry, for the honor of his part of
the country, to give this account of it to
the eastern members, but in point of com
[ mon justice to Mr. Preston, they ought
i be informed that a southern election
i was quite a different fort of tranfa&ion
from one of theirs. In the evidehce be
i fore the house, it had been ftatcd that
one person had been seen at the court
: house with a club under his coat. " But
" fir," said Mr. Smith, " 1 have known
"Jive hundred voters aflembled, to have
" clubs under their coats. So that if
" such a circumllance is to set aside an
" eledtion, the committee may begin by
" dissolving mirre. If the committee are
" to break up every ele&ion, where per
" sons were seen drunk, they will have a
" great deal of work upon hand Sir."â
In what way were elections for southern
members carried on ? A man of influence
came to the place of election at the head
of two or three hundred of his friends ;
and to be sure they would not, if they
I could help it, fuffer any body on the o
ther fide to give a vote, as long as they
were there. It was certainly a very bad
cuflom, and must veiy much surprise an
eastern member, but it was the custom,
and perfe&ly known to be so, and there
fore it was very injurious to hold up the
conduct of Captain Preston, as a pretence
for dissolving the elcftion. The beha
viour of that young gentleman, when in
sulted, bad been exemplary. in the
midst of a riotous mob, he gave away
his sword, that he might do no mifchief
in that way. This was a great instance
of moderation and presence of mind.
The aspersions cast upon the chara&er
of this officer, Mi-. Smith regarded as
highly unjust and they might if not pro
perly taken notice of, be extremely inju
rious to his hopes of advancing in the
service. Captain Preston had gone to
the court-house as a private citizen, and
he had a rig-lit to be there. A? to the
menace of the soldiers that they could
knock down one of Col. Trigge's voters,
â tKift wss vtfn yc" IJT.llin fiuiif tii'fi-ft l Â°g tliat
they would do it. Were a man to have
come up to Mr. Smith in the street and
, fay, " I will knock you down fir," Mr. I
Smith would be for striking that man ;
but were he only to fay, " I can knock
" you down fir," the expression would be
quite different. But as to the affray that
fell out, after the election was over, Mr.
Smith asserted, that if the soldiers had
killed all the country people, or the coun
try people had killed all the soldiers, this
had nothing to do with the merits of the
election itfelf. And as to tins quariel,
few young men had the temper of this

his soldiers ; so that instead of the cen
sure of that house, he deserved their
praise. At his age, Mr. Smith would
not have ordered his men off; and as to
the censure on the military inserted in the
report, he did not agree with it. It
would be a very fine reason to be sure, to
vacate a feat in that house, because one
of the electors had been seen with a club
*under his coat! Mr. Smith was sorry to 1
gire such a dtfeription to the Eastern
members, of the manners of his country;
but he did so, that he might hinder them
from being hurt, at the facts brought for
ward in the evidence. He concluded by
reminding those members, that it would
be ridiculous to measure one thing by a
nother which was perfedly opposite ; or to
judge of a Southern by the enftoms of
an Eastern ele&ion. *
Mr. Clark said that three days had now

FLORENCE, February 1.
The Italians begin to be apprehensive
that the French may pay them a viiit, and
the Grand Duke of Tufcany, who was
induced by us to the measure of fending
away their Minister, seems now pretty
firmly determined not to give the French
asy farther reason to complain of him.
A small, fleet of transports arrived a few
days ago at Leghorn, from England,
with troops aboard, that had been intend
ed, for Toulon and, among them were
about 1 oohorfes. The hoi fes had fuffer
ed much from a long voyage, and it was
abfdutely neceflary to get them on (here,
forwh;cb purpose application was made to

The following letter was read from the
representative. of the people with the army
of the Weft to the co remittee of public fafety
" Saumur 21 Pluvoife, 9th February.
"We did not fuppcfe, citizens colleagues,
that we Ihould have been obliged to write to
you concerning the execrable La Vendee.
We had conceived that the victorious army
traversing for the second time this unhappy
country, would have been only reduced to
the neceflity of immolating to the manes of
our brethren some vagabond hordes, and that
the country would have been afterwards
wholly 111 the power of the republic.
" Things, however, have changed their
appearance, without, however, wearing a
menacing afpedl. Some of our columns have
IV| becn defeated by the royalists, w ho are about
4000 strong. We hasten to inform you of
thii c'rrumftance, because fre are fjre that
the diikffeifted will endeavor to alarra the
public mind, by magnifying t'he danger.
ViSory, however, will soon attend Us, and
our biave republicans will iaflidt a lign_l
vengeance on these rebellious royalists."

PHILADELPHIA,
MAY 3.
The following extraH contains a more intelli
gibh account 6J the position of the Allied
Armies in Flanders, than has appeared.â
From the Levden GazettÂ£, of March 7
ExtraS of a Utter from Brujfels, dated
March 3.
THE Conventional army, commanded
by general Pichegru, has made a general
movement in advance, wich leads us to
suppose that the enemy will commence the
campaign, by attacking us in our polls.
The towns of weft Flanders,
contibue Rot only to be menaced by Gene
ral Van Damme, who has under his com
mand, a body of 14 or 15 thousand men,
but they also fear an attack by sea, at the
fame time that they are on the land fide.
We learn that they are diligently occupied
at Dunkirk in equipping an armament of
small veflels, such as gun boats, floating bat
teries &c. destined for this enterprizeâthe
works are carried on with great diligence at
Fumes and Nieuport, to put those places in
such a pasture of defence as to defeat the
project of the French. In prosecuting what
they have for a long time had in view,
they daily renew their incursions into the
province of Luxembourg, horn whence they
carry off all the cattle and provisions which
fall into their hands. The 13d of last month
they surrounded and took pofieffion of an
Austrian port of 20 men, in the village of
Frifanges, which they afterwards pillaged.
The 26th, they entered in great numbers
the valley of Virion, from whence they took
a great number of waggons loaded with
grain and other commodities.
Col. Mack after having made a gene
ral survey of all the posts occupied by the
allied troops, from the sea to Luxem
bourg, returned to Valenciennes, where
after his arrival, there was another coun
cil of war held between the Generals.
The following is the position of the
armies which cover the frontiersâThe
center of the grand Austrian army com-
/// >
manded by Prince Saxe Cobourg covers
Valenciennes, Conde and Â§>uefnoy. The
tight under the orders of Count Clairfayt
covers Tournny, Orchies and Marchiennes
âwhile the left under Prince Hohenlohr,
covers Mons tint] Chorltroi. A cordon of
troops commanded by Generals Latour
and Beaulieu, extends from the borders of
the Meufe to Luxembourg.
In Weft Flanders, the Englifli army
occupies Courtray, Wevelghem and Menin,
and the Hanoverians, Fumes and Nieuport
A corps of ten thousand men is beyond
this divifian, in cantonments at the ex
tremes of the frontiers.
The government is at this moment en
gaged in. making arrangements with each
of the Belgic provinces to raise a body of
ten thousand men, intended to com
pleat the Walloon regimentsâThe inlift
ments we hear are to be only during the
warâBrabant is to furnirti three thousand
âFlanders four thousand, and the other
three thousand will be raised by the Pro
vinces, in proportion to their population
âThe hereditary prince of Orange, and
the princess his wife, arrived here the day
before yesterdayâThe fame day a body
of Dutch troops arrived here.
The celebrated Dr. Priestly is about to re
move to this country. His opinions have

ly understood, is the only Uafij.on which
universal justice, facrcd order, and perfect
freedom, can be firmly built, and permanent
ly secured. The view of it exhibited in this
elfay, at the fame time that it repreilVs tbs
insolence of office, the tyranny of pride, and
the outrage* of oppreflion ; confirms, in the
most forcible manner, the necelfify of subor
dination, and the just demands of lavHul au
thority. So far indeed, from loosening the
bands of society, that it maintains inviolate,
every natural and every c'vil diftinftion,
draws more closely every Ibcial tie, unites in
one harmonious and justly proportioned sys
tem, and brings men together on the even 1
ground of the inherent rights of human na- ]
ture, of reciprocal obligation, and of a com- ,
mon relation to the coramuuity.

The Public are cautioned to i ;
beware of counterfeited Five Dollar Bills of
the Bank of the United States, and Twenty %
Dollar Bills of the Bank of North America,
federal of which have appeared in circulation <
'within a few days pafl ; they are a good ge- i
neral imitation of the genuine Bills, but may I
be diftmguijhed by the following
MARKS.
Five Dollar Bills of the Bank of the
United States.
ALL thai have appeared have the letter F.
for their Alphabetical Mark.
The Texture of the Paper is thicker and
whiter and it takes Ihe ink more freely than
the genuine paper.
The O. in the word Company is smaller
than the M. and other letters of that word,
so that a line extended from the top of the O,
to the top of the M, would extend con
(uiterajjiy above &be range of the whole, word.
In the word United the letters ire narrow
erand clofei* together than the reft of the bill
The i and fin the word promise are not
parallel, the yinclining much more forward
than the i.
The eng/aving is badly executed,the strokes
of all the l etters are stronger and the devi e
in the margin particularly is much coarser
appears darker than in the true bills. Some
ot the counterfeits bear date in 1791âWhere
as the Bank was not in operation till Decern
her, and no five dollar bills were issued in
year.
Twenty Dollar Bills of the Bank of North
America.
ALL that have appeared have the letter
B. tor their alphabetical mark.
They are printed on a paper nearly similar '
to that of the counterfeit Five Dollar Notes
above described ; the engraving is bettei exe
ucted, and they approach nearer to the ap
pearance of the genuine bills.
The Â£11? ruled linesthrough the word Twen
ty, in the body of the bill, are in number thir
teen irl the genuine bills, and but twelve in
the counterfoils. \
The word Company is much like the fame
word in the Five Dollar B lis as defer ibed a
bove, the 0 beii?g lets than the m, ethers
following.
There is no stroke to the / in the word North
whereas in ihe genuine bills the stroke is well
defined.
The .letters ent in the word Twenty, to the
left hand at the bottom, do not come down to
the line, out are so cut as to give an irregular
appearance to the word, the Tw and the>> go
ing below them.
The -signature | ftixon, has the appear
ance of oeing written with lamb-black and
01, and differs from other inks used in
printing the bills and the caftiier's signature.
It'is supposed 1 these forgeries were committed
in fomeofthc Southern States, as all the coun
terfeits thai have appeared, from
1 hence, and two pet fens have been appTFhcirelâ-<
ed-in Virginia,on fbfpicion'of being the author
of them.
The reward of ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS
will be-paid to any or Persons who shall
di fcover and prosecute to convi&ion the several
offenders of ihe following defci iplious or any
of them, viz.
The person or persons, who manufa&ured
the paper on which the Bills are primed.
The person or pqrfons, who engraved the
plates. \
The printer or printer*, Â©f the bills.
Every person who has a&ed as a principal in
any ofiber way, in the counterfeiting and utter
ing the said Uilis.
Philadelphia, March 28, 1794
April 22, 1794,
Other counterfeit bills
of the Bank of the United States have appeared
in circulation.
The denomination is of TWENTY DOL
LARS,and the alphabetical mark is the let
ter B.
They may be distinguished from the genu
ine tyv the following MARKS :
The paper of the counterfeits is of a more
tender texture and glofley furface than the
genuine, aiid there is no water mark in them.
The letter C. in the word Cafliier, in the
true bills is strongly marked, whereas' in the
counterfeits, the whole letter is a fine hair
stroke, evidently in an unfinifhed state. The
letter * in the Word demand, is badly formed
and the who.'e word ill done, and there is no
comma at the end of it, as there is in the
genuinfe bill*.
The margitfal device, is much darker in
the falfe, than in the genuine bills owintr to
the shade (frokes being coarser, much nearer
together, and consequently much more nu-,
merous. This difference strikes the eye at firft
view.
The fame reward of ONE THOUSAND
DOLLARS, will be paid for apprehending, &
profeciiting to conviction the several above
deferred Offenders in refpeft to this, as to
the lait defenbed bills-
