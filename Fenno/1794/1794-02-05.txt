JOHN VAUGHAN,
From the United States Chronicle.
Mr. Wheeler,
Please to insert the following observations
in the Chronicle, and oblige the friends
of justice and humanity.
IT appears by information from Suri
nam, that the brigantine Nancy, of this
port, commanded by Joseph B. Cook, had
arrived at that place, with a cargo of
/laves from the coast of Africa ; and that
during the pairage, they made an attempt
to recover that liberty with which they
were endowed by the common Parent of
the Universe, and of which they could
not have been deprived without the molt
outrageous violation of every principle of
Religion, Jullice, and Humility ; but in
consequence of this laudable attempt to as
sert their natural and unalienable right,
several of their number were destroyed by
the Captain and crew of tire brig. It may
perhaps be alledged, in extenuation of the
crime, that the white people only aÂ£ed in
felf-defence but the reply is obvious.
Who were the aggrefTors ? Who forced
the wretched Africans from their native
countryâfrom all the tender and endear
ing attachments of husband, parent and
child ? Who crowded them into the hold
of the Vefiel, or as Mr. Wilberforce em
phatically stiles itâ" The floating Jhop for
the sale of human flejh." who by such base
and barbarous means, provoked them to
a natural and jull rcfiftance.
Should we condemn a number of Ame
cans for rising on the crew of an Alge
rine cruizer ? Should we not rather ap
plaud and wiffi them success. May not
the barbarians of Algiers retort on our
African slave traders, the severe rebuke of
an infpiredapoftle, "Thou that fayeft a
man fliould not steal, dost thou steal ?"â â
Can they who are concerned in the detes
table slave trade, and are thus accessory
to theimurder, and the misery of so ma
ny of their fello* creatures, can they en
joy the profits resulting from the ' blood
stained traffic! Can they reflect on the
tears, the groans, and the agony of the
wretches whom they have reduced ro such
complicated fufferings, and not feel their
fouls harrowed with the most painful re
morse ; but by whatever arts they may
now sooth orfupprefs the upbraidings of
conscience, the time is afluredly approach
rng when they will forrowfully realize
this sacred declaration, " Verily there is a
GOD who judgeth in the earth, who
will render to every man according to his
works ;" and as He hath been pleased to
ordain civil government " for a terror to
evil doers," surely it is incumbent on the
ftrongarm of the National Legiflatureto
exert itfelf in the prevention of Crimes
more abhorrent than those which the In
dians on our frontiers frequently perpe
tratd on the defencelefs inhabitants
those savages with refpeft to Divine rev
elation " fit in darkness," while we are
indulged with the meridian splendor of
gospel light ; we boast the most accurate
knowledge of the rights of man, and ex
ult in having been the fuccefsful defend
ers of those rights ; âthey in many in
stances only avenge the wrongs they have
fuffered, while our Slave-Traders fend
to a distant country, seize on the inno
cent and unoffending natives, and com
pel them to a state of the most cruel
slaveryâbut this abominable traffic in
our own species is not only repugnant to
the di&ates of that Revelation which in
forms us, that " GOD hath made of one
blood all nations" but the feelings of hu
manity are shocked at the fad recital of
the attrocious crimes which are insepa
rably ccmnefted with the odious practice ;
and philosophy, by the elegant pen of a
Raynal, reprobates it in language too
pointed to be omitted in this animad
version. " The Highwayman (fays the
" Abbe) attacks you, and takes your mo
ney, the Slave-Trader carries olf even
your person the one invades the
rights of societyâthe other those of
nature; âthis ceitainly it the truth, and
RTI S E
[Whole No. 505, j
if there exiiled a religion which authori
zed only by its iilence such horrors ; it it
did not. continually denounce vengcance
againfi the authors, and the instruments
of this tyranny âif fucb a religion exit
ed, the minister and the altar ought to Lc
crushed in one common ruin."
Il it should be thought that the fevcri
ty of censure contained in this publica
tion requires an apology, the writer would
borrow one from Mr. Pitt's admirable
speech in the British House of Commons
âafter describing, in terms of the most
pathetic eloquence, the matchless horrors
of this nefarious tradeâhe addsâ" I
know, Sir, 1 slate this fubjeft with
warmth ! I feel it is impofiiblc for me
not to do soâor, if it were I should c?c
teft myfelf for the exercise of moderation.
I cannot without fufiering every feeling,
and every pafiiori that ought to rife in the
Cause of Humanity, to deep within me,
speak coolly upon such* a fubjeft. There
is no excuse for vs, feeing this infernal
traffic as we do, it is the very death of
Justice to utter a fyliable in support of
it."
In committee of the 'whole on Air, Madison's
Mr. Giles commenced his remarks by
observing that if an apology had been
deemed neceflarv from the nature of the
fubjeft, and the vote he proposed to give
upon it, it was rendered more so from the
eloquence displayed by the gentleman who
had just preceded him. (Mr. Dexter of
Maflachufetis.) The gentleman â . s done
ample justice to one fide of the fubjeft,
and he was sensible the opposite fide in
his hands, would fuffer by the companion.
He proposed under his present impres
sions to vote for the general proportion,
and such of the resolutions in detail as
would can y the general principle into full
efFeft.
These measures contemplate eonfidera
ble innovations in the existing (late of the
commerce of the United States. He had
anticipated the 'gentleman last up, in the
refle&ion that extensive innovations into
existing fyftems,ought to be ad6pted with
caution. Calculations upan which they
are founded, (hould be adjusted to the
magnitude of the ejcpechd objedl ; and
the probable efficacy of the means propos
ed to be used for its attainment.
Hence he readily admitted, that flrong
reasons in favor of the proposed rfiea
fures ought to be expected before their
adoption; and any possible hazard of
their results, ought to be amply cornpen
fated for the importance of the end to
be attained.
He observed there was another circum
stance which juftilied an apology. The
mercantile interest of the United States
will be the moll immediately affeifled in
their occupations by the proposed mea
sures and the gentlemen of this bouse
from this scene of business, fcem moll to
doubt their expediency.
We have been told, with emphasis, tjf
the intelligence arid patriotism of the mer
chants of America, and it is admitted that
the truth has not been exceeded. The
merchants deserve great crecit for their
conduit since the exiftencc of the prefect
government ; and their opinions upon this
iubjeft ought to produce additional cau
tion.
It Ihould be remarked, however, that
merchants, like all other descriptions of
men, are influenced in some degree 'oy ex
isting connexions, formed habits, m l con
sequent prejudicesâthey recoil from ..iv
poflible interruption in the usual court:

resolutions.They magnify every hazard aiifing
from a change in the direition of their
employment, into certain and politive
lets. Although, therefore, their opinions
ought to have weight and pioduce cau
tion ; yet, they ought no" to command a
decision from others unattended with con
viction. For if those of the committee,
not of this description, be compelled to
decide upon the present queition, f.om
extraneous mercantile indications, with
out requiting conviction# from their rea
sonings ; there are indications t>f the mer
cantile scene 011 the other fide the Atlan
tic, operating in commendation of the
proportions, with as much force, as those
on this fide the atlantic, in oppolition to
them. It is remarkable that this whole
description of men are actively opposed
to the p iflage of the proposed measures :
Their sensations upon this fubjeii have
been evidenced by their anxious attendance
upon the progress of the buiincfs. If
the proportions should eventuate in a na
tional commercial conflict, the inference
in general might be made, that what it
is their intereit to prevent it is our interell
to *Â».?<?. The British court are equally
fenGtive upon this subject. They have
at several periods manififtcd their alarms.
It may be concluded that thele sensations
hive arisen from the opinion, that the ef
fects of the proportions will be such as
are calculated upon by the favorers of
them. He was unwilling, however, to
hazard a vote upon any extraneou9 eir
cumftances and should look into the me
rits of the queflion.
He felt that some apology was due to
the state and diftriit whofc immediate re
presentative he was. Virginia is an ex
porting ilate, without vessels, and with
out a mercantile capital, equal to the
employment afforded to capital. The
town of Petersburg exports much in va
lue and much in bulk; the surrounding
country grows liiefe articles â¢, vessels and
capital are wanting for the exportation of
this produce. Hence the proposed mea
sures will be particularly felt for some
time by this part of the United States.
He relied however With confidence on
the virtue and patriotism of the people,
and fhoulJ ast from a belief,, that they
would even rejoice in a temporary incon
venience with a view to pcrmamcnt good;
and that their joy would not be diminish
ed by the recolleÂ£tion, that the tempora
ry ill which they may sustain, would pro
duce a temporary advantage to their eas
tern brethren, without excluding them
from a full participation in the permanent
good to be expedted.
He remarked, that he felt the more
diffidence upon this fubjeft: since he
frankly acknowledged, that he did not
po.Tefs an accurate knowledge of the de
tails of commerce, and (lid not propose to
make any material addition to the Hock
of mercantile information, now before the
committee. He proposed to use the fails
furnilhcd by other gentlemen, and acknow
ledged an obligation, for the information
they contain. He proposed to consider
the fubjeft, in the various shapes it had
a (Turned since the commencement of the
discussion ; and to state the results, which
had been formed, in his own mind.âln
making the attempt, general principles
will be resorted to, and minute arithmetical
calculations as much as possible, avoided.
The gentleman, who firft favored the
committee with his remarks (Mr. Smith
of S. C.) admonilhed them of the propri
ety of separating political, from commer
cial confideration# in the course of discus
sion. If this rule had been rigidly enforc
ed, he remarked that perhaps, three fourths
of the impressions made upon his mind fa
vorable to the propositions, wculd have
been lopped off without consideration. He
could not conceive, for what cause, the
political (hould be separated from the com
mercial part of the fubjedt. The propo
sitions may eventuate in a change in the
direction of the business of one whole oc
cupation in societyâa change of the dis
position of the nation, in so important a
point, mull have a very interesting politi
cal afpeft, as it relates to government
internally : the present fubjeft exhibits an
important political feature, as it relates to
the external connections of the govern
ment, with foreign nations. If therefore,
it should be observed as a rule, to pass up
on this fubjeft, by excluding from view,
all the political considerations connected
with it, the rule woirfd include an effen
tijl omission of duty. The gentleman
himfelf, however, in the next sentence,
furnifhed an example of the violation of
the precept he had just prcfcribed, by
calling the attention of the contmittee to
the political fituatiofi of the United States,
at this dtlicate crisis, and urging this cir
cumtlance, as one reason againlt the adop
tion of the proportions. The gentleman
then proceeded to present the fubjeft in
two points of view. The one, the rela
tive conduct of Franyc, and Great-Bri
tain, towards the United States: the
other, the conduit of Great-Britain to
wards the United States, comparatively
with other foreign nations. To present
the fubjeft in the firft point of view, the
gentleman furnirtied an anonymous table,
calculated to a date anterior to the com
mencement of the late revolution in France.
As the only history of this table, with
which the committee have been favored,
was, that it was the compilation of a gen
tleman of considerable mercantile informa
tion, it is presumed the gentleman will
not be surprised, if it should be deemed to
be of doubtful authority ; the rather as it
was the ground of a severe and unmerited
crimination of the gentleman, whose re
port is now under consideration, and who,
it is believed, would not fufferin a compa
rison, in point of intelligence, accuracy,
or pa;riotifm, either with the laborious
compiler of the table, or with the gentle
man, who has been judiciously fele&ed,
for its interpreter.
He remarked, that the table bore upon
the face of it, evident marks of partiality,
and inflead of having them effaced, they
were aggravated by the commentator.
One irrefiftable evidence of the partia
lity of the table confide, in aflcrting that
American flour is free, to the British Weft
Indies, and'excluding from view, the abfo
lutc monopoly of the carriage, and the
monopoly of contrasts for returns.
It is presumed that the gentleman at
lead cannot except to this criticism on
the table, because one of his chief cen
sures against the gentleman whose report
is before the committee, which was even
carried so far as to infer improper motives,
arose from a suggested omifiion in the re
port, which will be found upon examina
tion to be wholly immaterial. An evi
dent partiality is cbfervable in the inter
preter of the table in an earnest attempt
to eftabliih this principleâThat prohibi
tory duties on flour in Great-Britain af
forded an equal encouragement of the ar
ticle by commercial regulations, with a
free importation into France, or at least
with a duty admitted by the gentleman to
be too trifling to be counted. The com
mercial arrangements of France in this
particular, leave this article upon the true
ground of competition in the growth of
the articleâthis ground of competition
is destroyed in Great-Britain by commer
cial rellriaionti. In the one cafe, compe
tition in the market is all that could be
reasonably expe&ed, and that is grantedâ
in the other cafe competition would be
alike desirable, anil there it is provifion
arily excluded.
Another evidence of the partiality of
the interpreter of the table consists in the
zealous attempt to establish it as a princi
ple, that is. 3d. sterling duty upon to
bacco per lb. is no discouragement to the
growth of that article this idea was
grounded upon the suggestion, that the
consumption is not thereby lessened, no
substitute being afforded for it in Great Bri
tainâTobacco does not average to the ex
porter 2 pence sterling per pound: The
duty is at lead seven times as great as the
prime cost of the article ; âthe great con
sumption of this article is by the poorer
order of the peopleâthe Hate of society
is fuck in Britain at present, that hard la-,
bor during a whole year will hardly afford
a scanty fubfiftance to the laborer, hence
necessity compels this description of per
sons to economize in the use of the article,
or to avoid the use of it altogotherâof
course the consumption is materially les
sened, and the growth of the article is dis
couraged from the operation of the duty.
The gentleman founded his fierce attack
againll the gentleman whose report is now
uuder consideration, for omitting to insert
in his report, that there was a higher du
ty imposed by Great Britain upon all o
ther foreign tobacco than that of the U
nited States, and hence infeiTed a friendly
disposition from Great Britain to the U
nited States. The insertion of the fact
would have added to the bulk of the re
port, but could convey no additional ufe
ful information.
It is known that the high duties impos
ed upon all foreign tobaccoes, took its rife
during the colonial exittence of these dates;
it is known that it has not been altered
since their independence ; it is known that
the tobaccoes of the United States are
furnilhed at so much cheaper rates, than
those of any other country, that there
would be no danger of competition if the
duties in Britain were the fame on each.
It is likewise known that the United
States furnilhed a fufficient, a redundant
fupplyforthe consumption of all Europe';
hence Great Britain has not thought pro
per lince the revolution to destroy this re
list of colonial regulations, not because
(he wilhed to favor lis, but because (he
would not theriby have benefited herfelf;
hence too, the omillion of this information
could not be material, and the insertion of
it would only liave served to contradict
the inference endeavored to be established,
of the favorable disposition of Great Bri
tain towards the United States.
There is one manifeft impropriety in
confining our enquiries to the date pre
ferred by the gentleman for this table: it
would involve the absurd consequence of
adjulling our laws to a retrofpeftive, in
stead of a progreflive state of things. It
would be as ridiculous as an attempt by
law to prefcribc rules for the proper de
portment of the ghosts of our forefathers.
It is to be hoped that the date could not
have been fixed upon from a wi(h that the
United States (hould indirectly furnifh a
countenance for the restoration of despot
ism ; and it was matter of regret that the
gentleman (hould openly avow a distrust of
the permanency of the French revolution
as one motive for the conduct.
Mr. G. remarked, that he hoped the
permanency of the revolution of France
was as much greater than the permanency
of the ancient despotism of Franceâas the
great fabric of nature, than the petty plas
tic productions of art.
Here Mr. S. rose to explainâhe said
he had pursued a principle, adopted by
Mr. Jefferfon in his report : he read a
paflage from the report, from which it
appeared, that the report had been calcu
lated to the summer of 1792.
Mr. G. replied, that the principle was
just reversed, the one had reference to a
state of things posterior to the revolution;
the other, anterior to the commencement
of it during the existence of the ancient
despotism.
If the table were to have any influence,
it mull arise from stating, the real relative
dispositions of France, and Great Britain
towards the United Stales ; but if the e
poch to which it relates is to govern, it
will exclude some of the strongest testimo
nies of the inimical temper of Great Bri
tain,and of the friendly temper of France.
Are these confideraticns to have less
weight, or to be wholly excluded from
the view, because they are more recent ?
Is it because we are now laboring under
these aggreflions, and from some late dis
patches likely to continue so, that a reme
dy is to be with-held ? He thought not ;
and therefore (hould proceed to (late some
of the evidences of the dispositions of the
two nations, displayed since the epoch al
luded to.
Great Britain has fubje&ed our vefTels
upon the high sea, to seizure and search,
and exempted those of Sweden and Den
mark. He wiihed to press this fadl, up
on the gentleman who preceded him, be
cause he had denied that Great Britain,
had made any discriminations amongst fo
reign nations, injurious to the United
States.
Great Britain has invaded our velfels
on the high seas, and refufed them the
protection of French propertyâThis is
an acknowledged violation of the laws of
nations ; at lead of the last convention of
nations upon the fuhjeft.
Great Britain has prevented our veflels
from conveying to our friend and ally,
goods not contiaband,and compelled then*
to make sales to btrfelf, or some of her al
lies.
Great Britain has compelled our vefiels
to deviate their courses, and to their great
hazard and loss, detained them for trial
upon frivolous pretences.
Our vefTels have been fubjefted in her
courts, to the danger of subornation ; to
precarious and uncertain testimony.
Great Britain has been the inftrumrnt
of letting loose the pirates of the Barbary
slates, upon our commerce. This fact
however doubted upon the firft report, is
placed beyond doubt, by the late conduct
of Portugal, towards our vessels in her
ports.
Are these fa&s denied ? If not, dft
they not operate directly and fpecifically
upon our commerce. Is it not astonish
ing, after all these fadts are known, and
often repeated, that gentlemen should be
heard to enquire, what injuries have we
received from Great Brit;l:n ? And to in
fer that the United State i are equally fa
voured with othef nations. In addition
to these things, Great Britain has observ
ed the most rigid silence upon the fubjeft
of friendly commercial arrangements. â
The gentleman who preceded him,doubt

BOSTON, Jan. 27."
Authentic news from Franre.
Extradl of two letters from a gentleman
of undoubted veracity, vvhofe informa
tion may be depended upon, now in
France, to his friend in this Town,
dated
Paris, 03. 2t>, 1793
" The (late of France is much altered
within a few weeks for the better. Liber
ty mud triumph, and I thank God there
is such a nation as the French to defend
her causeâsome di ft relies mull happenâ-
some wrongs mull be committed ; âbut
the principle is eternal, and mull finally
prevail."
" I cannot help fending you this, in
hopes it will reach you by the fame velTel
that I wrote my last. The affairs of France
are much altered within a few days, and
every appearance juihfies the moll san
guine expectations in favour of their final
success. Nothing could have placed them
on so good a footing as the total destruc
tion of all their internal enemies, or ra
ther civil wars : but they have not only
done that, but appear in a fair way to re
pel all the combined armies. They have
been beaten upon the Rhine, a complete
surprise was effe&ed; but in every other
part they have the advantage, should Tou
lon be re-taken which is quite probable,
(as thi French have driven the Spaniards
English quite into the town) 1 think
the dance will be up. I cannot but be
lieve, that in cafe France falls, America
will follow."
It is presumed fays a correfpondcnt,
that the two branches of the Legislature
will be exceeding careful about answering
the speech of the Lieutenant-Governor,
least they should give offence âthis Gentle
man was for many years a member of the
Senate, and was always of opinion that
it was improper for Speeches to be made
from the Chair, and he uniformly and
pointedly opposed answering them ; this
circumstance is well knownâhow-then is
it to be accounted for, that the more we
aim at the principles of " Liberty and
Equality," the ftrongerwe feel attach
ed to MONARCHICAL FORMS
AND CEREMONIES.

BALTIMORE, Jan. 31.
From Martinieo, Dec. 17th.
We learn, that on the 12th Dec. a
Britilh squadron of 8 fail of the line, and
frigates and transports to the number of 50
fail arrived at Barbadoes. That General
Rochambeau has but a fma'.i regular force
of whites and artillery, but had seven
thousand armed mulattoes and i.- jrocs, 111
whom he inltilled the idea, 11 â . (hould
the British conquer Maitinico, they would
be fold to slavery. It is therefore expec
ted that they will light witli great brav
ery.
The preservation of the m. arts of know
ledge, among the /cur/? ranks, is of more
importance to the Public, than all the
PROPERTY of all the RICH MEN
in the COUNTRY. It is even of more
consequence to the rich themselves, and
to their prjhrity. The only question is,
Whether it is a public emolument ? And
if it is, the rich ought undoubtedly to
contribute in the fame pi oportion as to all
other public burdens, i. e. in proportion
to their wealth which is secured by pub
lic expences. But none of the means of
information are more sacred, or have been
cheri(hed with more tenderness and cart,
by the" settlers of America, than the
PRESS. Care has been taken that the
Art of Printing (hould be encouraged,
and that it (hould lie easy and cheap, and
fafe for any person to communicata his
thoughts to the public.

COMMERCE.
From calm, commercial sage debates,
Held in th' A {Terribly of the States,
We find our commerce underftpodâ
By merchants ? Noâby men of woodâ
Men who from inland regions cameâ
Where commerce scarce is known byname!
Alasâwhat ignorance prevails,
Where commerce fpreadsher broadest fails!
Ye hardy sons of northern climes,
Howchar.g'd from gooioldfi/hion'</times;
Once to your Interest, Heady, true,
That Interest ye no more pursue :
But fend to patch your navigation,
The greatell botchers in the nationâ
When Patriots from the old dominion,
Quite twilled round from old opinion,
With Resolutions ready made,
To help your artists and your trade,
To raise your commerce, sadly smitten,
By the haughty power of Britainâ
To keep vour money in your hands,
To purchase boundless trails of lands;
To pay old debtsâaye this is true,
So long to Brxtifh merchants dueâ
To keep y our wives and ekeyouv daughters,
From buying baubles, gauze and garters,
Or which is betterâbid defiance,
To Europe's Despots in alliance ;
And brave the storms which rage afar,
By bringing home the sweets of Warâ
Of this you cannot fee the Glory,
But turn to ridicule, the storyâ
Nor patriots from the Allegany,
(Sans doute as candid too as any )
Nor all the powers of eloquence,
Can force you to be men of sense ;
Nor make you cease to apprehend, ~j
That all these projefls really tend, >
To bring our commerce to an end. J

Extradt of a letter from the Captain of
one of the American vefTels to his owner
in this city, dated Bourdeaux, 4th No

" We have been loaded since the 4th
Sept. failed on our voyage, (bound to
Philad.) but were ftdpped at the mouth
of the river by a guard (hip, and ordered up
to Paulack, where we were obliged to lay
until the 18th October; then all the load
ed (hips were forced back to Bourdeairx,
where we now lay, and cannot tell when

It can no longer be a doubt, fays a
correspondent, that the tendency of certain
measures is to (hake the public credit of
this country to the foundationâto reduce
the value of our exports more than one
haveâby destroying all competition in
our market for the produce of our coun
try âto dimimjh., in lieu of encreajing our
commerce âto deprive us of what every
other nation has always considered as an
advantageâour neutrality ; to arrest our
progress in the Scale of Nations, and to
blast all cur profpe&s of happiness under
the auspices of peace, freedom, and a
government of lawsâand to plunge us in
to all the horrors of foreign, if not domes
tic war.

Mr. Fenno,
As the following contains as cogcst argu
ments for the United States going to
War with all the world, as any I have
heard of, you will please to republifh it.
FROM THE BOSTON GAZETTE.
Mejfrs. Edes iff Son,
HAD the United States of America
discovered their Jlrengtb and prowess, by
breaking off all commercial connection
with Great-Britain and her Colonies,
when flie declared war against our allies
the French ; had we even declared war
againjl her, we should have shown to the
world that we deserve to be ranked among
the nations of the earth, and we should
not have been impeached with the fin of
ingratitude. Belipve me, my country
men, that our character as a nation, his
fuffered more by the pufdlanimity with
which we have borne the insults and in
dignities from thd creatures of Great-Bri
tain on the high seas, and from the crea
tures of that creature residing among us,
to our injury and ruin, than if we had dis
covered a boldness and freedom of spirit to
(land by those who once saved us from de
ftruftion. Believe me, that the powers
of Europe will continue their opinion of
us as an ignorant, timid and a stupid peo
ple ; nay, from our conduct towards our
only friend, they will have cause to difpuie
our bravery. But I hope in God the
time is near at hand, when our enemies
the Britijh will be again convinced of our
understanding, integrity, refuurres and
COURAGE. The PEOPLE at this mo
ment have a good will to {how their cou
rage, notwithstanding they are told by de
famcrs of Liberty, that we have no resour
ces, and are in no condition for war. But
such, and such only, you will find are in
the Funding who lurk and Jhulh in
an Infvrance-Ojjice âor such as afifume the
character of a rich Priest, the fly one of a
Bank Scrivener, or the dirty, infamous,
abandoned ope of an Informer, who are
all the creatures of that system of tyranny
âthe FUNDING SYSTEM.
From the General Aavertifer.
A correspondent thinks this the time
to distinguish the patriot from the enemy
of his country, to diiiinguifh between the
man who has private, and the one who has
public good for his object. That man
who seeks to cast the United States at the
feet of Great Britain is any'thing hut a
patriot, is any thing but a republican ; â
and he whocan fee no injuries that the U
nited States have fuftained v from Great
Britain, he who is unconfeious of the
wrongs which have been done us by that
nation,who can fee nothing but a conduct
which can be juflified or at lead extenuated
is that man. If to have a public debt is
to produce the blessing of the influence
and injlrumentality of Britiih policy, to
little purpose has America contended ; to
little purpose have her patriots dyed the
foil with their blood. Where a public
debt can enter into competition with the
general interest and rights of a nation# it
certainly cannot be denied that that na
tion and her creditors have separate and
diffinft interests, and that the preponde
rance of credit to those general interests
and rights, must be subversive of public
liberty.

JUST PUBLISHED,
By THOMAS DOBSON,
Bookseller, at the Stone Houfc, in Second
llreet Philadelphia.
VOLUME X. OF
Encyclopedia ; or Dictionary
Of Arts, Sciences, and Miscellaneous
Literature, on a Plan entirely new ;
BY WHICH
The Different Sciences and Arts,
are d'tgejled Into the form of
Diftindl Treaties or Systems :
THIS volume contains principles of Levels
Liberty, Doctrine of Light, Lightning,
Lock*, Logarithms, Logic, History ol Lon-
don, Longitude. Luther, Lydia, Macedon,
Madagascar, Magic, Magnetifai, Malts, His
tory of Man, Marriage, Mary, Maryland,
Masonry, Materia Medica, Meadow, Mecha
nics, with a great variety of Biographical and
Miscellaneous articles, illuilrated with Twen
ty two Copperplates.
As a number oft families are still in the
country, and it is not generally known who
arereturned. T. Dobfon, solicits the favor
of the fubfcr bers to calf or fend for their vo
lume*;, that they may be supplied as early as
poflible.
The tf.nth volume of the Encyclopedia is
now presented to the public ; but as it makes
its appearance in an imperfect state, some ac
count of the reason of that imperfedlion should
be given. On the Bth of September last, the*
Publifker had the misfortune of having his
Printing-Office burnt down by a fire which
broke out in the neighbourhood, and a great
quantity of his printing materials destroyed,
and among o flier articles, the figures, with
which he was printing the tables of lo
garithms, belonging to the present volume,
were melfcd down by the violence of the fire.
As a supply of these could not be immediately
obtained, he was under the neceflity of pub
Hilling the volume without these tables; but
hopes he (hall be able to publifli them with the
next volume which is now in conliderable for-
wardnefs.
The Publisher embraces this opportunity of
expressing his grateful acknowledgments to
the generous public, for the very liberal pa
tronage with which his undertaking has been
honored; at the fame time he takes the li
berty of reprefen ting to l'uch of the subscribers
as are in arrears, the indifpenfible necessity of
punctuality, both in taking up ihe volumes as
early as possible after publication, and of pay
ing for them when taken. Many of the sub
scribers having got only one, two, thiee, &:c.
volumes, and several volumes remain unpaid.
Thus the work hangs in all its different stages
from the commencement; and though the im
portance of a few dollars may be but a trifle
to the individuals, yet the accumulation of
these trifles unpmd lays the Publisher under
very serious embarraflment,and deprives him
of the ufeof many Thoufonds of Dollars which
at this time would be of very eflential fervioe.
For tbefe reasons the Publisher finds himfelf
under the necessity of recurring to the original
terms of publication, 3nd in future no vo
lumes will be delivered but only to those who
take and pay to the time of publication.
