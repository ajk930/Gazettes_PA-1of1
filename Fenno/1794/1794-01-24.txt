in this city require that Printers (hould

Persons at a diilance who wifli to re

terms of fubkription cannot be dispensed
with.âOne half of the fubfci iption mo
ney, for the half-weekly paper lately print
cd'ar.d circulated by the Editor to all pars
of the Union, is yet due, either from the
subscribers, or collectorsâand as the pub
lication of a daily paper is attended with a
heavy expenseâhowever folicitor.s the
Printer may be to dilfeminate intelligence,
it will appear, that persisting in his former
plan of fending his Gazette to every pet
fon who writes for it, without fecuving
the fubienjitions will prove ruinous in the

WARSAW, (Poland) Sept. 29.
The lad lett ers from Grodno of the
25th inft. prove, that our conje&ures with
regard to tire imal event of negoclation
with Pruflia were not groundless. It end
ed as it began, or rather surpassed all the
violences exerc.ied on the 2d of this
month.
On the 3d the Ruffian AmbaiTador, ear
ly ill the morning, opened this negociati
-011, by arreting four members of the Diet,
viz. Krafnodembiki, of Liva, Szydloulki,
of Aloe, Mikellki, of Wyzogrod, ami
Shayrnfki, of Lomza ; whom he sent off
immediately under a gua rd to the respec
tive places they represent.
Next, he ordered two hsittalions of gre
nadiers with three pieces of cannon, to sur
round and block up all the avenues and
gates of the cattle.
After these preliminan cs, the fitting of
the Diet began. Its formal opening was
strongly opposed, on the ground of a for
mer decree, that all deliberations should
cease, whenever any violent a& should be
employed against a member of the legisla
tive bodv.
dti*
In consequence, before the reading of
the ambafladors's notes was allowed, two
deputations were fi'.cceflively fait to him,
to demand the liberty of the arretted mem
bers. They were answered both verbally
and by note, with absolute refcfal. The
notes were then read. The lioufe conceiv
ed itfelf to be ill a pallive state, as being
under foreign anr.F., and deprived of a free
deliberation, would not proceed for many
hours on any business, during which time

they witriclW a wsoft cHftrrfuilg' and humi
liating scene : a Ruffian General, lfcruttifcg
to and fro in the middle of the Senate, in
the presence of .he King on the thront>
persuading and menacing alternately, the
members to sign unconditionally the de
mands of the King of PtulFia.
Five hours were ipent in tnif crannerj
at last, on tlie motion of Count Aukwi&z,
Nuncio of Cracow, It was agreed to make
a solemn declaration, or protest, again it
the violent measures employed by the
Ruffiau Ambassador on the 2d of Septem
ber, and this day ; and that to prove a
total inactivity of the .Diet, instead of ex
prefiing their sentiments in the usual man
ner either by voting, or acclamation, they
Ibould keep a mournful silence when the
marshal fliould propose the pro;eft in ques
tion. This was accordingly adopted.
Thus was obtained the consent to a
ceflion, which is to juftify it in the eyes
of Europe and pouerity. Thus ended
the extraordinary negociation, unexam
pled in the annals of Diplomatic history :
and thus, in consequence, was iigned the
treaty of Ceflion of our provinces to Prui
fia.
The three notes of the Ruffian Ambas
sador prcfented that day, are curious and
singularâthey will be. known to the pub
lic. The pifttcft, however, of the Diet,
ought to be particularly noted by the
present generation and all poilerity.
Declaration of the Diet.
" Surrounded clofelv by foreign troops
on the 2d of this month, threatened with
further iuvafion of the tenitoryof there
public by the Prufiinn armies, to its uttev
moft ruin, and oppreired by innumerable
violences, the States in Diet aflembled,
were forced to give leave to their deputa
tion for signing rhe imposed treaty, with
addition of a few claufcs, and such only
as the di&ating power itfelffeemed, in pi
ty to approve of. But with grief and
surprize, we find by the fad experience
of this day, that the court of Berlin Is
not fatisfied therewith. We fee fre(h aÂ£ta
of violence forcing a new project upon us;
and in order to support it, the fame pre
ponderant power, not contented with in
vesting the place of our deliberations by
an armed force, with addrefling to us
notes full of menacesâfeizea from among
us, and carries off our members ; and, by
an unexampled proceeding, keeps us, the
king, bent under the weight of age, and
under so manifold calamities ; and us, the
Hates cf the Republic, confined and im
prisoned in the Senate
" Thus fttnated, we do declare iu the
moll solemn manner, that, unable to pie
vent, even with the risk of our lives, the
effects of the opprefiive force, we leave to
our pofteritv, happier perhaps than 0111-
selves, those means of faying our clear
country, whereof we are bereft at present
and that the project sent to ue by the
Ruffian Ambaifador, though contrary to
our laws, wilhes, and opinion*, forced by
the above raeaiii to accept âWe do accept.

In committa Â»f tb- latnle, <m the report of
tin Secretary Â»f Suit.-, relatiiv to tht com
mercial intcrcourje of this c.unity, <uinh so-
re>Â£* nations.
Mr. Nicholas spoke as follows :
Mr. Chaikman,
I feel a great embarrassment in speak
ing on this iubjea, from a distrust of my
ability to treat properly its acknowledged
importance, and from the apparent expec
tation of the iiudience. 1 feci too, as the
member from Maryland who {'poke yei
terday did., from the imputation of mo
tives, well knowing that the Representa
tives of inv country, are indiiftrioufly re
potted to be enemies of the government,
and promoters of anarchy, and that the
preient meafuie is imputctt to these prin
ciples.âlt is fomtwhat remarkable, that
farther north, we are charged with felftfh
nefs, & want of attachment to the general
Welfare, for a luppofed opposition to mea
sures of the import of the present I
mention this contradictory inference, to
{hew that the lhameful deligns charged
upon us, are riot proved by the faÂ£t, and
to place the guilt where it only exists, in
the malignity of the accuser.
It is a commonly received opinion, that
trade should be intruded to the direction
of those immediately interefled in it, and
that the actual course of it, is the best
which it could take this principle is bv
no means a fafe one, and as applied to the
trade of America, is fallacious.
It can never be just, where the beginning
and growth of commerce have not been
free from all poflible conilraint, as to its
uireCtionj as that can never be called a bu
fi.iefs of ae&ion, which has been created
under foreign influence.âThe manner in
which America was firft peopled, and the
nurture {he received from Great-Britain,
â¢fford the molt ftrtking contrail to the
requilite before-mentioned. The firft in
habitants of America, were educated in
Great-Britain, and brought with them,
all tlie wants of their own country, to be
gratified chiefly by the productions of
that ccuntiy. Aided by Britilh capital, ip
th â  k-ttl.-ment of the wuderntfs, and de
pending on the fame means for the con
veyance of its produce, to a place of con.,
fumptioii. it Pas inevitable, that the do
mana for Britilh commodities, fijonld keep
P"ce with the improvement of tile coun
try.âln the commencement of American
population and its early stages, there does
not appear to have, been a chance of cotn
pan'ng the advantages of commercial con
necti-in, with different Countries, and it
will be found that in its progress, it was
It'll more retrained. In the Iyears of
til" dependence of America on Great-Bri
tsin, the principal part of America, was
occupied by large trading companies,
composed of people in Great-Britain and
conducted by factors, who funk large funis
hands of the fanners, to attach
them to their respeCtive stores, bv which
mtans, competition was precluded, and a
depcndance on the supplies of those stores
completely eftabliflied. Since the revolu
ticn, the business has been conducted by
pcrfons :n the habit of depcndance on
Great-Britain, and who had no other ca
pital, than the manufactures of that coun
try, furnifhed on credit. The business it
still almoil wholly conducted by the fame
means. In no liage of its growth then,
does there appear to have been a power in
the consumer to have compared the pro
ductions of Great-Britain, with thole of
any other country, as to their quality of
price, and therefore there is no propriety
in calling the course of trade, the course
of ?ts choice.
Tile fuhject before fce committee, na
turally divides itfelf into navigation and
manufactures, in fpetiking of \vhich, I (hall
offer some other considerations, to {hew
that the fame cfleets are by no. means to
be expected, from the greatelt commerci
al wisdom in individuals, which are in the
power of the general concert of the com
munity ; the one having in view, profit on
each feperate transaCtion, the other pro
moting an advantageous result to the
while commerce of the country.
> ii considering the importance of navi
gation to all countries, but cfpecially to
luch ns have To cxtciilifc a production of
bulky articles, as America, I think I shall
lhcw that the tail observation, is accurate
ly r *Â£ht, ahd that the interest of the whole
community. not t'noie only who are the
carriers, but those also who funufh the ob
ject of carriage, pofitivclv demands a do
mestic marine, equal to its whole business;
and that, even if it is to exist under rates
higher than those of foreign navigation, it
is to be preferred. In circumstances of
tolerable equality, that can never however
entirely be the cafe, for in the carriage of
the pioJuce of one country, by the flip
ping of another, to any other place jhan
the Country to winch the Shipping be
longs, there is considerably more labour
employed, than would have been by do
mcltic fliipping, as the return to their own
country, is to be included. On this ground,
it may be confidently aflerted, that where
the materials of navigation, are equally at
tainable, they will always be more advau
tageouflv employed, by the country for
whole life they are intended, and that if
undei such circumstances, another country
is employed as the carrier, it mult be un
der the influence of fomc other cause, than
interest, as it refpefts that particular busi
ness. A dependence on the (hipping of
another country, tends to establish a plact;
of depdut in that country, of those exports
which are for the life of others, if it is at
a convenient diltance from them. The fu
perintendance of property, makes short
voyages desirable for the owner, and the
connection that soon takes place, between
the money capital of a country and its fliip
ping interests, greatly strengthens the vor
tex. The attainment of wealth beyond
the demands of navigation, leads to an in
terest in the cargo itfelf, and then the
agency in felling to the consumer, becomes
important, It is apparent, that as the
final sale depends on the wants of the
purcbafer, all intermediate expences of
care and agency, mult be taken from the
price to which the maker would be enti
tled. Our own commerce has involved
this loss, in a remarkable degree, and it
has gone to an enormous extent, from a
necessity of fubmittmg to the perfidy of
agents, anting from a dcpendance eita
blkhed bv-means of the so much boasted
'credit
, fhat there is -this tendency in the em
ployment of foreign fliipping, is not onlv
proved by the commercial importance of
Holland, which became thus from her iaa
val resources the store-house of Eutope,
without furnifliing any thing from iier
own productions, hut also from the varied
experience of America. Before the: re
volution, every thing for European con
ftimption was carried to Great Britain,
but imce America has possessed flnppin"
of her own, and in the northern slates,
there has been an acceflion of capital, the
export to England is reduced one half.
It is true indeed, that there is (till nearly
jjitc half of what she receives, that is re
exported, but it will be found that she still
retains a proportioned share of those in
fluences, which formerly carried the
whole. Great-Britain, un-der till the dis
couragements of our laws, which we are
told by the mercautile members of the
committee', amount to a prohibition where
they have any rivals, did, until the Euro
pean war, possess one-third of the foreign
tonnage employed in America This ifas
been supported by the dependence into
which the southern states were placed by
credit, and here as 1 in every other step of
the conneÂ£tiofi,this engine extorts advanta
ges from us, beyond the compensation
which is always secured in the firft ad
vance. If there wanted other proof of
the British interest in the American navi
gation, being supported in dire<St opposi
tion to our interests, it may be found in
the comparative state of the tonnage em
ployed, where it appears that, after the
protecting duties once had their effeÂ£t,
the additional tonnage to a considerable
amount, has been entirely American, and
that the British tonnage has remained
very nearly stationary.and in proportion to
their undue influence.
In time of war, in addition to the in
conveniences before stated, which are in
hanced by throwing the trade from its ac
customed channel there are great and im
portant losses brought on a country by
this kind of dependance. If your car
riers are parties to the war you are fub
jefted to the war freight and war insu
rance on your cargo, and you are cut off
from all the markets to which they are
hollile; and indeed from our experience in
the present war, I may fay you are cut off
fiom the market of your carriers them
selves, as it would have been impossible for
Britifli veflels to have escaped in our seas
lait summer. To what extent this loss
goes may be seen from a calculation in
the Secretary of State's report on the filh
eries, making the proportion of war to
that of peace in the 100 years as 42 to
100; and on that calculation there can be
r.o hesitation in determining that the in
terest of the farmers requires that this
foreign dependence (hould end here.
But the European war, by making a
temporary exclusion of British {hipping
lias already brought on us the greatelt
mifchief of such a regulation; and by the
encouragement it has afforded to our (hip
ping, almost compleated the remedy ; so
that we have reason to consider this as a
fortunate period. But it is not merely
the advancement of our marine that is
contemplated by the present resolutions,
the security of that which we have is also
dependant on them. The danger from the
Algevines has been eflimatedin this house
at j per cent on the vefTel and cargo, but
the whole encouragement to our own (hip
ping; in our exifling laws consists in the
one tenth additional duty on goods im
ported in foreign vefTels. Whenever there
(hail be an European peace, which cannot
be far distant, the whole difference between
the two sums will be a direct encourage
ment on British (hips and will probably
be equal to two freights. Do gentlemen
rely on the precarious profpeft of build
ing frigates, and the more precarious ser
vice to be rendered by them when built,
fa much as to neglect any other regula
tions for the fafety of our (hipping when
tl ley are so much in their power 2

By report of the peasants, it seems
that there has been a very warm action be
tween Gen. Beaulieu and the French the
day before yesterday, in the neighbour
hood of Phillipfville. The loss of the
Auftnans alone is estimated at between 2
and 3000 men. Waggons are gone from
thence to bring in the wounded, for whom
it will be difficult to find place, as the hos

felf reduced to the necessity of a&ing on
the defenfive, as well as the Pruflians on
this fide of Saverne, who have been ob-
liged to fall back, and to support themselves
by the right wing of the Auflrian army.
We imagine that a general action is now
indifpenfablt, as 'we cannot remain eight
days in our present pafition without the
most imminent hazard, and we have no
longer any tiling to hope from the favora
ble dispositions of the people of Stra/bourg.
Our negotiations were discovered; and
the Commiifioners from the Convention
have so effe&ually intimidated all thofc
who were inclined to open the gates to. usâ
so many of them have indeed been seized,
and so many more denouncedâthat we
dread the fate of our incursion. This
aftonifbing army of Republicans has been
formed in three days, and it swells like a
torrent. They are half armed, and want
every thing but an cnthuliafm for liberty,
which perhaps is better than our discipline.
Qur hope is, that the Swifj Cantons will
at length give up their system of neutra
lity, and declare against these Anarchifti.
PARIS, November 7.
Execution of Philip Egalitc. ,
This celebrated personage yesterday un
derwent an interrogatory before the ReJ
, volutionan- Tribunal. AH that is hither
to known of what parted there is that be
ing questioned refpefting his intimacy with
Sillery, the deputy lately executed, he
answered, "I was attached to Sillery un
til the moment that I refufed any longer
to fee him."â' You have neverthdefs
(fays the Piefident) committed the care
of your children to his.wife who is now
with them abroad."â" Yes (anfwired
Egalite) but that was at a time when I
had no cause to fufpeft Sillcry."
This moll villainous, most cowardly,and
mofl infamous of wretches, was condemn
ed to death at the feme fitting at which
he was tried ; and yesterday evening, at
half past five o'clock, he was executed on
the Place de la Revolution, three hours
after judgment was pronounced ugainft
him.
On the fame day that Egalite fuffered,
and on the fame fcaffold, Was like wife exe- ,
cuted, Coqftard, another Deputy of the-
Convention.
Bailly, the..late Mayor, willfoon fuffer
a similar fate ; he has been trantferred to
the Coneiergerie, and so has General
Carles.
General Houchard and Brunet; and
M. Barthelemy, the author of the Voy
ages of Anacharfis, have been also trans
ferred from the Abbaye to the Concier-
gene.
The total number of perfcns confined
in the several prisons, was yesterday 3255.
The wife of Roland Is ihortly to ap
pear before the revolutionary tribunal, to
give information refpefting the retreat of
her husband, or to undergo the punish
ment which waÂ» reserved for that Ex-
Minister.
Madame Kolli, wife of the Ex-Farmer
General of that name, had obtained a
suspension of her feutence, by declaring
herfelf with child. The time for that
proof being elapsed, (he was yesterday de
livered over to the guillotine. Lemayne,
Wamfer, Lacombe, and Purguette, mem
beri of the Popular Commiflion at Bour
deaux, have' (hared the fame fate.
Execution ef Ekissot and Twenty other
Deputies.
On the 21 ft O&ober, BrifTot and twen
ty other Deputies, fuffered the axe of the
guillotine. The following is the official
report published hy order of the revolu
tionary Tribunal on this head :
The Tribunal, an the declaration of the
jury, dating, that BrifTot, Vergniaud,
Genfonne, Duprat, Valaze, Lehardi, Du
cos, Boyer, Fonfrede, Boileau, Gardien,
Duchaftel, SiHery, Fauchet, Duperrtt,

" Condemns the above-mentioned per
sons to death ; declareÃ their effects con
fifcated for the use of the Republic, and
orders that the sentence be executed in
the place de la Revolution and that it be
printed and distributed throughout the
Republic."
VaJaze, one of the condemned, stabbed
himfelf after he had heard his sentence.â
The Tribunal has ordered, that the car
cafc of the suicide be brought to the
place de la Revolution, that it may be bu
ried with the other condemned Deputies
in the fame place.
On the day after their condemnation,
the}' were- conveyed together, to the bloo
dy fcaffold ; on their journey thither, fays
one of the French papers they enterediiito a, very feriout and eloquent debate,
rrfpe&ing the Immortality of the Soul;
ira this fubjeft, they are said to hare ulti
mntely agreed, that the Intellectual Spark
survives the dlffolution of the body.
The execution took place between ele
ven and twelve o'clock, and though per
formed as speedily as poflible, took up
the space of thirty-fix minutes.
They all preserved a solid firmnefa,
and individually at the moment of being
stretched upon the machine, exclaimedâ
Vive la Republic ! Vive la Nation !
Briffot himfelf, except on this occasion,
was thoughtful and silent.
Sillery smiled and bowed on every fide,
to the fpeftators.
Fauchet, the Constitutional Bishop,
was attended by a Confeflbr, with whom
he was much engaged in a vÂ«ry serious
discourse.
Carra appeared indifferent, said little,
and looked contemptuously.

second La Vendee is preparing in the
mountains of Befancon, in which large
bodies of difaffe&ed men have afiembled.

are fortifying Nieuport, and the inunda
tion is continued.
The light companies of the militia re
giments have received orders to'noldthem

Trial of' BrifTot, and the other Accused
Deputies..
Brilfot and the other deputies were car
ried before the Revolutionary Tribunal on
the 23d ult. They were each in
terrogated.
The Revolutionary Tribunal has been
previously divided into 2 fettions, for the
morefpeedy difpatchof bufinefsjjt One of
the feftions was to confine itfclfffolely to
the trial of the deputies.
On the 25th ult. in the morning, they
were conveyed from the different prifom

Thrfe persons were then severally ques
tioned relative to their profeflions.
Antiboul replied, that his occupation
was to defend the rights of the people,
and to prosecute tyrants.
The other deputies replied, that they
were deputies to the national convention.
The President of the revolutionary tri
bunal then aflced them whether they had
chosen official pleaders to defend them ?
Boileau, deputy for the department of
L'Yonne, declared,- that he had felefted
a person to undertake his defence, but if
he refufed, he would defend himfelf. Brif
fot, Vergniaud, Valaze, Lafource, Sil
lery, and Carre, replied, that they would
defend thcmfelves.
The witnefies were then callcd in and
examined by the public accuser.

Intelligence was received yesterday at
Lloyd's by the Aguila, arrived eft" Dover
that the Madras airay wfcnt on the I oth
and 1 ith of June againll Pondicherry,
which is said to have surrendered on the
Ift of July. The French had marched
to attack Fort St. Divids.
Cairicial had also been taken by the
and a French Indiaman captur
ed in the Roads.
Infurreftions still prevailed at the Mau
ritius,where the white cockade was moun

November 16.
Accounts received from Manheim of
the 4th inft. give a confirmation of the
railing of the siege of Landau. After a
(hort bombardment in the nightof the 3 1 ft
of Oft. the Prussians on the ifl Novem
ber withdrew their artillery from the bat
teries, and returned to their camp, deter
mined to take the town by famine only.
The French are dated not only to have
received reinforcements on the river Saar,
but they have even made movements a
gainst the cordon of Prussian troops, the
latter were obliged to retreat to Pirmafents
âThis is said to render the pbfition of
the Auftrians very precarious in exposing
their right. Reports even went so far as
to assert, that the Prussians hid been ob
liged to evacuate the post of Pirmafents,
but which is not confirmed as yet.
Yesterday Capt. Cook of the Spitfire
sloop, arrived at the admiralty office, with
dispatches from Lord Hood, at Toulon,
Vvhich place he left on the 3 ift Oft. His
dispatches are dated the 30th ; but from
the silence observed refpedting their con
tents, we fear they are not of the moll a
greeablenature.
Gen. O'Hara had arrived there from
Gibraltar, with a reinforcement of troops
and the combined forces, composing the
ganifon, amounted to ij,ooo men, who
were in good health, well provided, and
in good spirits. The Republican army
was increasing so rapidly, that the allies
in a few days expected to be in a state
of siege.
A raifunderftanding is said to have a
risen between the British and Spanish ad
mirals, relative to the command of Tou

November 17.
France has declared war against Genoa.
Letters from BrufTels mention, that the
celebrated M. Condorcet, one of the pro
scribed members, of the Convention, has
found means to make his escape from
France, and is arrived at Lausanne in
Switzerland.
A Paris paper of the Bth mentions, that
in the fittiug of the 7th a letter was read
from Gen. Relagge, who fays that he had
entered Catalonia, after an obflinate en
gagement with the Spaniards.
By advices from Toulon to the 30th of
October, we find that nothing material
had taken place. On the 15th the French
attacked a fort which was erecting to de
stroy one of their batteries. Two hun
dred of the allies were obliged to give
way to superior forces after the loss of
100 men, among whom was Capt. Tor
riano of the 30th.
Letters from Genoa, dated October 23,
mention that General Carteaux and Gar
dam, continue to bombard the forts and
navy of Toulon, but without success.
That the French lirtperiufe of 40 guns,
which was funk, had been raised ; that a
32 pounder burfl on board the Royal
George, killed 16 men, wounding several
others, and {battering the quarter deck.
His Majesty's packet the Halifax, for
Barbadoes and Jamaica; the Grantham
for New-York ; and the Expedition, with
one mail and government dispatches for
Lifbod, were detained at Falmouth by
contrary winds, when the last accounts
came away.
Advice has been received at the Admi
ralty, that the Alligator privateer, of Jer
sey, lias taken two valuable Danilh (hips,
laden with military (lores fÂ»r Brest, and
sent them into that island. The Alligator
hoiftea the French National Flag, and by
that means deceived the Danes, who sup
posed her to be aftu,illy a French vefiel.
A letter from Havre, dated the 2d inff.
informs rs, that all the English tradesmen
and merchants, who .vere taken up in that
city, have been released, and their property
reflored to them.
The French by a late general attack
on the frontiers, poffefied themselves of
several polls; but by the dispatches to
Administration, it appears, they have
been driven from tnfm againâMar
chicnncg, Menin, Furnes, scc. are again in
the pofleflion of the combined forces.
Mifcrllatuotu Intelligence,
Twelve companies of gunners, two
squadrons of cavalry, and three battalions
of the Revolutionary army, set out from
Paris yeiterday. Their defoliation il for

Madame Roland is at present on her

Her behavior is firm, and her abfwers to

The feftion of Mucius Scsvola has
adopted ?. resolution tending to diflblve the
Department of Paris. The resolution
wns sent to the other 47 feitions. The
feftion of Arc's denounced this measure,
declaring that thÂ» department had never
loft their confidence.
The council of the commune suspended
the resolution of the feftion of Mucius
SciEvola, and appointed a committee to
represent to the feftion, the impropriety
of their conduct, and to oppose the meet
ing which the feftion proposes to hold on
the fubjeft, on the 9th inft.
Taillefer, the Deputy, has been de
nounced in the Jacobin Club, for having
rtiarried an Aristocratic woman.
The army of the Rhine is in want of
cavalry. A large detachment is to be font
immediately.
From the Brujfch Gazette,
Lieutenant-General Baron de Beaulieu
reports that on the 2d in the morning* he
was attacked in hit position of MetteZ,
by a hostile corps of 6000 men, which he
repulsed, after killing 200 of them.
The General of Aitillerv, Count de
Clairfavt, reports likewise, that his ports
of Pont and BuiHieres, haying been at
tacked on the fame day, the enemy di
fefted against the latter pod a battery
of eight pieces of cannon, without hav
ing been able, notwithstanding their brisk
fire to difiodge our picqucts.
The post of Merbes k Chateau was al

From the London Gazette*
wi-iitehall; Not. 12
By intelligence received from the Earl
of Yarmouth, dated Brumbt, Austrian
head-quarters, October 24, it appears,
that on the morning of the 27, General
Wurmfer, having received information
that Hagenau had surrendered to the ad
vanced corps, under Gen. Mageroes, he
immediately put the bulk of his army into
motion, and arrived there that night, a
few hours before it had been eyacuatcd by
the enemy, who had made so precipitate
a retreat, as to neglect breaking down
the wooden bridges over which the artille
ry was to pass. That, on tbe 18th, the
French encamped on the right fide o.
Zorn, a small river that runs through
Brumbtâbut on perceiving some interval
between Gen. Mageroes advanced corps,
confining of about 6000 men, and the o
ther columns of the army, they crofted the
river, and attacked him with their whole
force, in the evident expectation of turn
ing his flank, and cutting him off from
the reft of the army. The aÂ£tion laded 7
hoursâbut upon perceiving the reft, of the
Austrian army move forward, the French
re-crofled the river, and evacuated the
heights and town of Brumbt, of which
the Auftrians took pofleflion. The loss
on the part of the French, is estimated to
be about 800 men, and that of the Auftri
ans nearly half that number killed and
wounded. That the prince of Waldeck
had advanced with his corps from Sohk,
and marched along the banks of the Rhine
âThat he had compelled the surrender of
Drugenheim, and after having driven the
garrifen of Fort Louis, with less, had in
verted the place. That, in the conrfe of
tbe night, the French had abandoned their
position on the Zorn, retreated under the
cannon of Stralburgh. That Gep. Wurm
fer was at the diflance of nine English
! miVs from that place.
la addition to the see-tints r,lrc.;.dy
publiflltd, of forcing cbe lines of Wjflern
bourg aud Lauterhoilrg, it appears that
the Auitrirn army ha<i between seven <*nd
eight hundred men killed and wounded,
and that the loss of the French coufifted
of between 3 of 4000 killed ; from 5 to
6000 pnfoners, and 26 pieces of cannui:,
with their ammunition, waggons and hor
ses. The retreat of the French on difÂ«
occasion was greatly favored by a thick
fog.

VOLUME X. OF
Encyclopedia ; or Dictionary
Of A ts, Sciences, and Miscellaneous
Literatuie, on a Plan entirely new ;
BT WHICH
The Different Sciences and Arts,
are digefiid into the form of
Diftindt Trearvs or Sytfenis :
THIS volume contains principles of Level*,
Liberty, Do&iine of Light, Lightning,
Locks, Logarithms, Logic, Hiltory of Lon-
don, Longicude. Luther, Lydia, Macedon,
Madagascar, Magic, Magnetism, Malts, His
tory of Man, Marriage, Mary, Maryland,
Masonry, Materia Medica, Meadow, Mecha
nics, with a great variety of Biographical and
Miscellaneous articles, illuiiratid with Twen
ty two Copperplates.
As a number ol families are still in the
country, and it is not generally known who
arere'urned. T. Dobfon, solicits the favor
of the fubferibers to call or fend for their vo
lume* s, that they may be supplied as early as
poilible.
The tenth volume of the Encyclopedia is
now pre fen ted to the public ; but as it makes
its appearance in an imperfect state, foiuc ac
coun i of the reason <>f that imperfection Ibould
be the Bth of September last, the
Pnbliiher had the misfortune of having his
Printing Office burnt down by a fire which
broke out in the neighbourhood, and a great
quantity of his printing materials destroyed,
and among other articles, the Figuees, with
which he was printing the tables of lo
garithms, belonging to the prelent volume,
were melted down by the violence of the fire.
As a supply of thefc could not be immediately
obtained, he was under the neceffitv of pub
lifting the volume without the c taslbs; but
hopes he dial! be able to publifli them with the
next volume which is now in considerable for-
wardnefs.
The Publisher embraces this opportunity of
exprefling his grateful acknowledgments to
the generous public, for the very liberal pa
tronage with which his undertaking has
honored; at the fame time lie takes the Ji-
berty of representing to ftich of the fubferibers
as are in arrears, the indifpenfrble necefllry of
pun&uality, both in taking up (he volumes as
early as portible after publication, and of pay
ing for them \yhen taken. Many of the sub-
fcribers having got only one, two, thiee, See.
volumes, and several volumes remain vkpaid.
Thus the work hangs in all its different Cages
from the coaunencemcr.t; and though the im
portance of a few dollars may be but a trifle
to the individuals, yet the accumulation of
these triples unpaid fays the Publisher under
very feriou* embarraflment, and deprives him
of the use of many Thonfands of Dollars which
at this time would be of very eflential service.
For tbefc reasons the Publilher finds himfelf
under the neceflHy of recurring to the original
terms of publication, and in future no vo
lumes will be delivered but only to those who
take and pay to the time of publication.
