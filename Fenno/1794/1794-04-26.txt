FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE..
GENOA, Jan. 10.
The following picture will give those
who are desirous of obtaining a just idea of
the affairs of Genoa, which continue to
be greatly embarrafted some information
on that fubjeft. The members of gov
ernment, that is, the whole nobility are
of course all ariflocrats, some young men
excepted. It would have been easy, es
pecially after the capture of Toulon, â to
have induced the Republic to declare in
favor of the combined powers. Govern
ment would have found no opposition
fiom the class which you call commoners,
nor from the people, for fay what we
will, the general interell of Genoa is to
preserve its tradfe : that of guarding its
property veiled in the funds "of France,
is but a secondary motive ; but, in con
sequence of the extreme violence of the
English, the pro'penfity of the second
class who are rich and of the people who
are not without energy, is entirely chao
ged. This injultice has at length produ
duced a spirit of independence. The
recovery of Toulon, which would render
an invalion of Genoa on the part of France
more practicable, added to the just con
dudt of the French with respect to the
Republic, has confirmed this change of
sentiment, and neutrality at all events is
to be maintained. As the government
has no power except when it has the ge
neral voice in its favor, a revolution might
be expected, were it to adopt a different
conduct. Hence, the'refufal of treating
with Sir Gilbert Elliot at La Spezzia.â
The government dares not fuffer the Ge
norfe and the French to imagine it is in
clined to abandon its neutrality. This,
like wife, accounts, for the effedts which
have been produced bj the artful negoti
ations of Mr. Drake and Lord Hood.
MADRID. Jan. 20.
It should seem that the court of Spain
interefled in the re-eftabji(hment of the
House of Bourbon ought to have .found
no difficulty in acknowledging Monsieur
Regent of France. Such, however,is the
wtaknefs of this court, and its want of
confidence in its allies, that it dares not
venture on this conduct. The title of Re
gent had been given to Monsieur in the
court almanac; but the edition was Sudden
ly withdrawn, and the sheet in which the
title flood reprinted.

and though conncils have often been held *

LONDON, Jan. 18.
THE twelve royalists, arrived at Jer
sey, are said to come from Anciene,
v hence they have reached the coast of
Biitanny, and effected their escape on
board a vessel they found near the coast.
These gentlemen, no doubt, belong to
the corps of general Biron which accord
ing to the reports read in the Convention,
waÃ on the 22d of December, defeated
and dispersed near Avernay. I his corps
confuted of no more than 4000 men.
The accounts of those fugitives cannot,
therefore, inform us of the situation of
the corps of royalists on the right bank of
the Loire, and still less of those on the
left banks of this river, under the orders
of the Chevalier Charette.
But however this may be, certain it is,
that Lord Moira is continuing his prepa
rations for the intended descent. Some
people are apt to find fault with the slow
ness of its execution, because it enables
the Republicans to encreafe their means
of defence. But the wisdom of our go
vernment, and the prudence of the gene
ral to whom this important expedition is
entrusted, entitled to suppose, that all the
obftaclfs able to oppose its success have
been forefeen, and the most effe&unl mea
sures taken to counteract them so as to
ensure success.
A rumour has been spread, that the Em
â¢ peror now refines the troops promised for the
above expedition. But we are convinced
that this report is groundless, and that his
imperial majesty, instead of withdrawing
his assistance in the execution of this enter
prize, would readily encreafe it if required.

The-Editor of the Leyden Gazette,
the fri*nd of truth and liberty as far
as the circumstances under which his pa-
per is published will permit, introduces
the Speech of Mr. Washington, on open
ing the Congress in December, with the
' fallowing preface:
" While Europe, towards the close of
the eighteenth century, presents an afpeft
the most doleful to philanthropy, deeply
afflitted by the, inconsiderate zeal with
which men rush into opposite extremes,
equally averse to public happiness; it seems
to havp been reserved for the New-World
to furni(h the consolation of this melan-
choly period,&, perhaps an asylum forthe
friends of freedom, the basis of permanent
tranquility. The U'ited States of Ame
rica, afford the example of a government
truly just and moderate. For this, next
to the public spirit and a national charac
ter of equity and wisdom, they are in
debted to some great men ; among whom
none will dispute the firft place with the
illustrious Washington. It is impossible to
read, but with real pleasure the successive,
produdtions of his pen, either as a states
man or a soldier."

HOUSE OF COMMONS.
Februa.y 6.
The LOAN and TAXES.
Mr. Hobart brought up the report of
the different resolutions moved yesterday
by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in
the committee of ways and means, for
raising money by loan, and creating a fund
rising out of new taxes for paying inter
est for the fame.
The Clerk, according to the usual
form, read the resolutions twiceâon the
second reading.
Mr. Fox rose, not for the purpose of
giving any opposition to the resolutions,
but simply of afkng for some information
on a fubjeft, which did not appear to him
very clear. He observed, that the Chan
cellor of the Exchequer, in the course of
his speech yesterday, had drawn a compa
rison between the produce of the perma
nent taxes of two different years, on which
he grounded his opinion of the probable
future produce that might be expeÂ£ted
from them. The account of the last year
ending the sth of O&ober, 1793, from
which it appeared fliat the total produce
of all the taxes for that period amounted
to 14.800,000!. but then from the sum
mil ft be deducted the pr6duce_ of t axes
that were not permanent, and which could
not of course be takes as part of a per
manent fund. It was stated in that ac
count that no less a sum than 700,0001.
was deducted from the above sum, be
cause such was the amount of temporary
taxes, if then this statement was correct,
it would follow that the' Right Honora
ble gentleman had greatly overrated the
fund, which might be considered as per
manent ; and consequently he would next
year have occasion to apply for aid to
make good a deficiency in a fund which
he considered ycfterday as productive to
the amount at which he had taken it.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer said,
that he had proceeded upon the most au
thentic accounts that he could procure,
and he believed, they were perfectly ac
curate. He had firft estimated the gross
produce of the taxes, forming the aggre
gate fund at 15,400,000!. and from this
sum he had tJedufted what had been paid
into it out of the produce of temporary
taxes, and afterward made allowance for
the defalcation that would be occasion
ed by taxes already repealed, or about to
be repealed, which, together amounted to
io,oool. so that the sum which he
might return as permanent, would be
15,290,0001. The printed account of
the three fitft quarters of the year 1793,
quoted by the Hon. gentleman, was very
authentic and correct; the difference be
tween it and that on which he himftlf had
argued might arise from the different way
of making up accounts in the different
departments of the revenue. In the cus
toms, for instance, was generally given
the gross receipt, without mentioning
how much was to be paid out of it under
the head of drawbacks 01 bounties; â
wljilfl the accounts made up at the Exche
quer stated the films actually paid in
there ; so that on the firft view of the to
tals of the two accounts, it would seem
as if there was some very capital mistake
in one of them, though in reality there
was none.
After some little farther conversation,
from which it appeared that Mr. Fox was
fatisfied with the explanation givea by
Mr* Pitt, the Speaker put the question
on each resolution separately, whieh paf--
fed witheA any observation, except that
when the resolution for laying an addi
tional tax on bricks, slates, titles, &c.
> *
Col. Bastard said, thati in the Weft of
England the principal manure of the
country was marie ; lie hoped therefore,
that care would be taken in the framing
of the bill which should be brought in on
this lubjeft, that marie so used should rot
be lubjeft to the tax.
No one spoke in consequence of this
observation, so that the refutation passed
without further remark.'
And then the quest-ion was put on the
last resolution, for iubjefting every person
to be admitted in future to ast as an at
torney to the payment of I 001.
The resolutions having been all confirm
ed by the house, it was ordered that Mr.
Hobart, Lord Mocnington, Mr. Rose, &c.
should prepare and bring in bills founded
on the fame.

NATIONAL CONVENTION.
Sunday February a
On account of the great influx of business
prefling on the committee of General Safety,
the care to watch over the fabrication of
falfe Aflignats was transferred to the Com
mittee of Aflignats and Money, this Com
mittee empowered to ifiue mandates of arrefl.
General Laroque, on trial before the Re
volutionary Tribunal, desired that the whole
army in which he served, might be examined
as witnefies. The Convention considering
this as an artifice to evade justice, ordered
that the Tiibanal ihould pay no attention
to it.

The Committee of Public Safety propo

The Committee of General Safety propo

no charge had been preferred!
Leonard Boudon said, the Committee of
had heavy charges against the m
both.
Danton said, there was reason to fear that
these.charges, made by Pbilippeaux, were
the offspring of malice; that the indiscre
tions of Roufin and Vincent were the effeÂ£l
of patriotism too ardent to be prudentâand
the Convention decreed their releaft.

night and day in hunting the Rebels like
beasts of prey. They had just brought in

From the American Minerva.
I TO THE AMERICAN PUBLIC.
THE answer of the Swiss Canton' 3 to
the Declaration of Lord Fitzgerald, pub
lished in the Minerva of yesterday, furnifh
es a most brilliant lesson for all good pa
triots in America. These Cantons enjoy
almost exclusively the little portion of
freedom left under the old governments
of Europe, as the United States do the
freedom of the New World. The allied
powers have been inceflantly importuning
the Cantons to take pait in the waragaifl
France, as certain Jacobin EmifTaries and
incendiaries have been plotting to drag
America jnto the war in favor of France.
But the parallel goes farther. The Swiss
Republicans fuffered most attrocious in
sults and indignities from a fait ion in
France, and nearly one thousand of their
brave soldiers were mafiacred on the 10th
of August 1792, without a crimt. Jnft
so the United States have been robbed
and plundered by the Britilh cruisers of
an immense amount of property', and their
seamen and flag grossly insulted. As the
allied powers made use of the massacre of
the Swiss guards to inflame the resent
ment of the Republics, and made them
take part in the war ; so the incendiaries
of France and America have made use of
the injuries done to our trade to hurry us
into a long' "desolating war.âThere is
something very interesting in this compa
rison.
But mark the words of the Cantons
in their note to Lord FitzgeraldâListen,
ye incendiaries, ye fire-fide heroes, ye ene
mies of your country, listen, and leam
wisdom from the brave and venerable Re
publicans of SwitzerlandâThey Â£av
" However afflicting the remembrance
of those terrible'evcnts in France (which
your excellency has brought to our recol
lection) and the fad fate of our brethren
who fuffered so unfortunately may yet
our grief must nevertheless yield to the
principles of our constitution : these prin
ciples have relied for several centuries on
the relations of peace, amity, and good
neighborhood with all the surrounding
powers.
" Tile operation of these principles hes
never been interrupted by foreign wars.â
A rigid and exact neutrality was the inva
riable maxim of our ancestors, and having
received it as a sacred inheritance, we have
conceived it to be our duty to abide by it
in the present was. And this conduct has
produced a salutary influence, not only on
our external fafcty, but on our internal
peace."
Mark the last sentenceâit is full of
good sense and found political reason.
They procced to declare that accustomed
to observe scrupulously all engagements,
they will not wanderfrom their neutrality
âand they will unite their foice to repel
even the flighted attempts to disturb their
repose.
In this resolution of the Helvetic body,
there is found morality, and true national
policy united with the dignity of a free
government. Revenge is laid ojit or the
questionâthe unprovoked Haughier of
nearly a thousand of their btethren, com
mands their grief, but does not change
their policyâThey will not rife ten thou
sand lives to revenge the loss of one, thou
sand ; nor plunge millions in distress to
gratify a favagc p'a/jfen. How heroic this
conduct, and how a:niab'ca.s well zspatri
otic the principle from which it springs!
Reflect on the Swiss Cantons, ye falfe pa
triots, who would cxpofe thousands of
lives, and thirty, perhaps forty millions of
(
.
1inoify to punilli Great Britain, and re
venue the loss of a million or two of pro
perly. View the example of the brave
Reyublicaps of Switzerland, and learn
trash and wisdom.

Yesterday arrived here from Greenock;
the ship Fanny, Captain Braine, after
a passage of 35 days. By this arrival
we have received London papers as
late as the ift, and Glasgow papers
to the 7th MarchâThe papers do not
contain any thing very importantâthey
are mostly filled with Parliamentary
(ketchesâof which we shall continue

however, appearing the mod important,
claim our earliest attention.
BRUSSELS, Feb. 20.
The head quarters of the Auftrians

Yesterday accounts were received from
America, brought to this country by two
ships frorri New-York, with letters as late as
the 14th of January. By these we learn,
that Congress had received intelligence of the
proclamation of our Privy Council of the
6th of November last, for seizing American
(hips under certain circumstances ; as well
as of the capture of several American (hips
in the Weft-Indies. Congress however, had
wifely determined on preserving a ftrifl neu
trality with all nations. American stocks
have risen in consequence.
February 20.
A gentleman who came passenger in the
schooner Success, Captain Leech, from
Norfolk to Liverpool, informs, that two
days previous to his departure from thence,
a letter was received from Mr. Parker, a
Member of Congress, from Virginia,
which dated, that the United States were
on the eve of a warâthat Cougrefs had
pafled a resolution to fortify all the towns
on the sea coastâthat upwards of 50 pie
ces of cannon were to be mounted tor the
defence of Charleston, and that orders
had been ilTued for buying up, on account
of the American Government, all the
arms and ammunition which could be pro
cured.
The Duke of York, in the ensuing
campaign, is to ast under the direflion of
Col. Maek, and the combined armies are
not to waste their time by flopping on the
way to attack or besiege any of the strong
ly fortified towns on the frontiers, but to
proceed in a mass to Paris.âStar.
Government yesterday received advice
from Portsmouth, that the cutter which
was dispatched from thence on Thursday
evening to look into the ports of " France,
from whence the expected invasion was said
to be projected, is returned, after running
so close ort Ihore as narrowly to have es
caped a red-hot ball from a battery ; and
reports that there>are no troops embarked,
nor shipping so numerous, or preparations
in any state of forwardnefs l'uch as had
been conjectured.
The French, having made great additions
to their strength, along all the frontiers
from Lisle to Dunkirk, threaten another
inroad upon Weft Flanders, and already
some severe fkirmilhes have taken place, at
the allied out posts. Gun-boats are said to
have failed from Dunkirk, for the purpose
of attacking Oftend by sea, to which place
theit troops, in great numbers, are endea
vouring to press forward by land. In the
mtan time, it is fatisfadlory to know, that
Oftend has been, for some time, in a condi
tion to make a vigorous defence.
The Juno Frigate, Captain Hood, com
ing from Gibraltar, entered the road of
Tqulon, not knowing of the recapture of
that place, anchored off the Caserns; â
when a boat with a French officer came
to announce to the Captain, that he was
prisoner of war. Capt. Hood requested
the Frenchman to take some refreshment
in his cabin, and profited by this interval
to cut his cables, and then bore away un
der a briflc gale. The French batteries
feeing the' Juno (heerjoff, direded a vio
lent discharge upon her, two of which
went completely through her without kil

Our letters from Bruflels, dated the

the French, which we had notice of in
our last letters, was not a falfe atarm.
The French had a&Oally began their ope
rations, and that in a mod formidable way.
They advanced on the fide ps Maubeuge,
and on the 1 jth a violent cannonade com
menced on the Austrian out-pofts. AH
the Englith troops have moved from their
cantonment, and the Auftrians have ad
vanced from Mons to the frontiers
The Prince of Cobourg had been for
two days at Bavar, and it was thought
that he would remove his head-quarters to
Valenciennes ; as for the present at least
they nmft continue on the defenfive ; â
70,000 French are already aflfembled be
fore that place, but it appears that Pich
egru yet waits the arrival of the cavalry.
Ten fail of French Ealt-India men
have reached Port l'Orient, an event
which has caused much joy among the uri
der-writers: at Lloyd's Coffee-honfe, where
some of them were deeply insured. This
arrival is to be the more regretted by this
country, as the French have thereby re
ceived a large fupplyof falt-petre, an arti
cle of which they were very much in want.
The brig Union, of Boston, Captain
Snow, lately put into Galway in distress,
bound from Virginia to Dublin, laden
with tobacco, was wrecked on the coast
of Wales, on her pafiage frpm Galway,
and two of her crew unfortunately perish

from Maryland to Bremen, is taken and

The great number of French collected
about Longwi and Thionville, seem to
threaten the Provinc.e of Luxembourg
with an invasion. The Ailfttian generals
have put that fortrefs, which, after Gi
braltar, is the ftrongeff in Europe, in a
most refpedlable state of defence.
On the iotliand iithinft. feveralbloo

Letters from Leghorn, dated January

He brought with him the Republican of

Last night Mr. Sparrow, the meflenger,
arrived at the Secretary of State's office,with
dispatches from our army in Flanders. A
general movement has taken , lace, and the
British forces had all drawn towards the
neighbourhood of Courtray expecting an at
jack. Their Head quarters are now at Haer
libeke.
As the armies are now in general motion,
the campaign may be expected immediately
to commence. The prince of Cobourg ar
rived at Valenciennes on the 19th, where he
has taken up his head-quarters. He was re
ceived with the most lively demonstrations
of joy, and the city was illuminated on the
occalion.
Yesterday accounts were received in town
by the Minerva from Bengal, for Oltend.;
that the r rincefs Royal, East Indiaman out
ward bound, on the 27th of September last,
near the Sunda Ifiands, fell in with three
French frigates, and engaged them for up
wards of one hour, when (he was obliged to
strike to their superior force. The carpenter
was killed ; the sixth mate, and two seamen
wounded.
The dreadful fire which broke out at
Gottenbourgh, on the 4th mflant, began
juftoppofite the town-house, which had a
narrow escape ; the flames and heat reach
ed it from the other fide of the canal, and
nothing but the most strenuous exertions
could have saved it. It is computed that
from 100 to 120 houses have been con
sumed, and upwards of 2000 people loft
their all in the space of ten hours; fortu
nately none of the British have fuffered.

We rejoice to find accounts from various

It looks like a return of friendly intercourse
with the islands in due time ; but when the

series of abusive treatment.
The (hip Holland, Capt. Franklin arrived
at the Texel 2 2d, January last, after having
been taken and carried into Cowes by the

ExtraS of a letter from a merchant in
London, dated February 10, 1794, to his
Correspondent in New-Tork.
"I hjve effected Insurance on the freight
of your strip at fix guineas per lent. When
is is considered that for some time past French
cruisers have flopped almost every American

France, of the fate of whose cargoes and al
so of their freights, we are ignorant, I am
led to hope the owners of the ship will think
she was done on very moderate terms. A
monglt those vessels supposed to be in France,
is thf Mary, Capt, Haley ; as since her ar-'

grand principle of Equality, if right

univerfai justice, faced order, and perfect
reedom, can be firmly built, and permanent
ly secured. The viewiof it exhibited in this
eÂ«ay, at the fame time that it reprefles the
uilolence of office, the tyranny of pride, and
the outrages of oppression ; confirms, in the
most forcible manner, the neceflity of subor
dination, and the just demands of lawful au
thority. So far indeed, from loosening the
bands of society, that it maintains inviolate
every natural and every civil dlftindtion!
draws more closely every fecial tie, unites in
one harmonious and ju/lly proportioned sys
