Thirteen persons, accused of having
been in corrsfpondence with Gen. Van

who endeavored, by their influence a
mong the inhabitants of that place, to fa

The following dispatch was received
this morning from Sir James Murray, &c.

majesty's principal Secretary of State for
the Home Department.
Champhin, OA. 30, 1793-
Sir,
" I have the honor to inform you of
the success of an attack upon Marchiennes,
which, by order of his Royal Highness,
took place last night.
" Eight battalions were put under the
command of Major General Krav, for
this enterprize. They marched at mic'-
night from Orchies in three columns, each
column headed by two officers and 60
volunteers, fupporfed by 300 men. These
were not permitted to load. The reft of
the troops of the different columns, with
their cannon, followed at fomc diftancc.
A detachment from the corps of Major
Gen. Otto, ported by Denain, marched
about the fame time, formed iu 4 columns,
in similar order that the town might be
attacked at once Upon all fides. The lat
ter troops were discovered by the enemy's
out posts, and prevented from penetrating
by the opposition which they met with.
Those under Gen. Kray, one column of
which advanced upon the high road from
Grchies, and the two others npon the left
of it, got, about 2 o'clock in the morning
within a ftiort distance of the town before
they were perceived.
dl w
" The volunteers at the head of the
column which was upon the road, fell in
with a picquet about 100 yards from th*
gate, which they surprised, killed the
greater part of it, and pursued the reft l.Â»
closely, that they entered the place 1-
long with them. The troops in the town
made little resistance. After being- driv
en from the market plate, where they
had assembled, they retreated to a con
vent near it. They there proposed
terms of capitulation, which Gen. Kray
consented to, as they surrendered prison
ers of war, with the folc condition of the
officers being permitted to wear their
swords.
" There are 1629 prisoners, officers
included, most of them troops of the
line. There arelikewife 12 piecesof can
non and 22 or 23 tumbrils taken. There
arc supposed to be about 300 of the ene

LONDON, Oa. 17,
The republic of Genoa have ap
pointed the Marquis of Spinola to be their
Minister Plenipotentiary and Envoy Ex
traordinary at the Court of London. M.
de Spinola is well known to England by
his talents, and mult be acceptable to his
Majesty by his political principles. He
was Minister in France, and has resided
in London ever I: nee the revolution of the
loth of August 1792.
The republic of Genoa is r.s much
pressed as ail the other states by the allies,
and chiefly by England, to put an end to
its neutrality,and to declare againll France
âNothing can bemore impoliticthau this
measure, and nothing more unjust. The
Genoese have so much property in
France, that to depart from their neutra
lity would be ruin to all their principal ci
tizens, and yet this consideration did not
operate on them to lean towards the
French, even at the time when they were
every where triumphant, and when they
made all Italy tremble. Even, at that
moment, they denied a paflage to the
French troops, to attack their own natu
ral enemy, the King of Sardinia. For
getful of this fact, however, they are
now to be bullied into the war, and of
course to be made partakers in the cala
mity, which it brings on all who are en
gaged in it.
The new Doge of Genoa is Joseph
Doria, the nephew of M. de Spinola,who
has reluctantly taken upon him the digni
ty. He is one of the inoft conliderable
men in the Republic, by his talents as
well as hereditary diftin&ion, and his be
ing forced to accept the office, is a proof
how much they are pressed by the allied
powers.
A letter from Marseilles, dated Sept.
ig, fays, that the French before Toulon
have got polTeffionof the fort of Ardenne,
cut off a stream of fre(h water that sup
plied the tows, and were preparing to at
tack the Pharon.
TheDeyof Algiers'has declared war
againfl the French, but in the mod vo
luntary and disinterested manner. What
ever rumour may fay to the contrary, he
has neither been bullied nor fubfiaized by
the British ministry.
On the 14th of July last, a convention
confiding of five articles, was signed at
the camp before Mayence, by the Earl of
Yarmouth and the Marquis de Lucchefmi
on the part of their Britannic and Prussi
an Majesties, to the following effeil.
" As the object of the war is to bring
about such a form ofgovernment in France
as (hall ensure security and tranquillity to
Europe, the contracting parties bind
themselves not to lay down their arms but
ky common consent ; and not until resti
tution is obtained for any depredation
which France may have made upon either
of the said parties, or on their friends or
allies, and not to permit the importation
of any military or naval (lores,corn,grain,
or fait meat,or provisions ; and to employ
all their means to injure the commerce of
France ; and also to prevent any neutral
fta'c from giving any proteftion,direftly,
or indirectly, to the French."
From the London Gazette.
WHITEHALL, Nov. 2.
By intelligence received frpm the Earl
of Yarmouth, dated Brumpt, Austrian
Head Quarters, 0&. 24, it appears that
on the morning of the 17th, Gen.Wurm
fer having received information that Ha
guenau had surrendered to the advanced
corps under Gen. Mageroes, he immedi
ately put the bulk of his army into moti
on, and arrived the're that night, a few
hours before it had been evacuated by the
enemy, who had made so precipitate a
retreat, as to neglect breaking down the
wooden bridges over which the artillery
was to pass. That on the 18th, the
French encamped 011 the rightbank of the
Zorn, a small river which rails through
Brumpt; but on perceiving some inter
val between Gen. Mageroe'sadvanced corps
consisting of about 6000 men, and the
other columns of the army, they crossed
the river, and attacked him with their
whole force, in the evident expeftationof
turning his flank, and cutting him oft from
the reft of the army. The action lasted 7
hours, but upon perceiving the reft of
the Austrian army move forward, the
French recrofTed the river, and evacuated
the heights and town of Brumpt,of,which
the Auftrians took pofleffion. The loss
on the part of the French, is eflimated
at 8.00 men, and that of the Auftrians,
nearly half the number, in killed and
wounded. That the Prince of Waldeck
had advauced with his troops from Soltk,
and marched along the banks of the Rhine
âThat he had compelled the furrendcr
of Drugenheim, and after having driven
the garrison of fort Louis, with some loss
had invested the place. That in the
course of the night, the French had a
bandoned their former position on the
Zorn, and retreated under the cannon of
Strafburg. That Gen. Wurmfer was at
the distance of nine English miles from
that place.
In addition to the nccountsnlready puh
liihed.of the forcing of the lines of Weif
fembourg and Lauterbourg, it appears,
that the Austrian army had between feten
and eight hundred men killed and wound
ed, and that the loss of the French con
fided of between 3 and 4000 killed .from
j to 600 prisoners, and 26 pieces of can
non, with their ammunition waggons and
horses. The retreat of the French on
this occasion was greatly favored by a
thick fog.

Bulletin of the Combined Armies, at the
Head Quarters at Bavay, Oft. 21
The enemy have attacked the polls of
Maucron, Romain, Orchies, Marchien
nes, and Denain, and marched in strong
columns and with a numerous artillery,
towards all these places, but they were e
very where repull'ed, except at Marchien
nes, where through their great superiori
ty they succeeded in repulsing the battali
on. of Kaunitz who defended this poll
Our loss in these affairs is very trifling.â
That of the enemy must be considerable,
since near Denain alone they have loft a
bove6oo men. Prisoners made are acap
tain, J lieutenants, and 55 soldiers.
The enemy were 10,000 strong ; they
have carried along with them 800 wound
ed. Our loss is very immaterial.
Our whole loss near Maubeuge, a
mounts in killed to 8 officers, 12 non
commissioned officers, 389 soldiers, 143
horses. Miffing and prisoners, 2 officers,
3 non-commiflioned officers, 267 privates,
25 horses.
Besides the adjutant Of lieutenant co
lonel Count Tavenfien, firft lieutenant
Baron Dornftein, has been killed by a
cannon ball, by the fide of field marshal
Cobourg.
The loss of the enemy, according to
all reports, mult amount to 8000 men :
near 300 men have been made prisoners.
We hate loft neither cannon, ammuniti
on, waggons, or baggage.
On the 22d the enemy made a very
bride attack near Menin and Orchies ; a
corps of the enemy of 6000 men, with 20
pieces of cannon, attacked our right
wing, near Cifoing, which fell back to
Templeneuve, in order to draw the ene
my into the plain : Major-General Boros,
who was at this latter post, made the best
dispositions to receive the enemy ; Col.
Count Kollovrath attacked them with the
infantry, fupportcd by artillery, aiid
broke their ranks.
Major Wofna, of Efterhazy huflars,
attacked at the fame time in front and in
Karaczy's light herfe chargcd
rear.
likewise ; and the remainder of our
troops, as well as a detachment of Eng
liih and Hanoverian cavalry, having ad
vanced in the interim, the enemy were
compleatly routed, with the loss of 400
killed on the field of battle and 100 pri
soners.
Our loss is of no confequencc, b it we
have to regret the brave captain Fabien,
killed with a cannon ball.

CONGRESS.
House of Representatives.
January 17.
In committee of the whole, on the report of
the Secretary of State, relative to the com
mercial intercourse of this country, with so-
reign nations.
Mr. Findley next rose
He suggested a diffidence in riftng on
the fubjeft, as it required a knowledge of
circumftancea and fatts which seldom came
under his consideration ; but having exa
mined the cafe with fufficient attention to
determine his vote, as no member claimed
the floor, he would offer some of those rea
sons which were convincing to himfelf.
He took notice of the member lalt up,
who aflerted that the additional duties pro
pof:d were not intended for prote&ing
manufacturer, nor as additional revenues,
but as bounties to the nations with which
we have commercial treaties. That no o
ther nation could furnifh us with fufficien
cy of goods, and who then aficed in what
manner we will raifc our revenues ?
To which he answered ; th:it the poll*
t'cal intention of the lefolution was to se
cure our independence as a commercial na
tion, and to make it the intcreft of certain
European nations to enter into commerci
al treaties with us ; they have refufed to
treat because they enjoy more advantages
without treaties than they could expeÂ£t a
ny treaties could feeure to them. He iil
ledged it was not properly a commercial
war, or a principle of revenge or retaliati
on that was intended by the resolutions.
Revenge for supposed insults offered to the
crown, may be the principle of the duel
ling wars undertaken by European des
pots, but fuc'n principles arc inadmiflihle
in republican politics. The design of the
proposed measure is to procure a recipro
city of advantages in commerce without
war ; it is calculated to procure justice, to
secure the practical enjoyment of that in
dependence, which though we have esta
blished after an arduous contest, we have
not reaped the advantages which ought to
have resulted from it, nor put ourselves in a
capacity to protest it.
The firft attempt to revise the confe
deration was expressly within the design of
verting Congrefi with fufficient powers for
rendering our commerce more independ
ent. When the revision of the government
did take place, this was a principal object
both in the enlargement of the powers, and
regulating the forms of the government.
The gentleman from Virginia, (Mr.
M.) has explained the reasons why filch
measures were not more early adopted, and
has properly suggested that those reasons
no longer exist.
The proposed reflrl&ions are necefTary
torail'e a competition in European markets,
and gave an option to our merchants in dif
ferent nations. Though the afTortment
for some time might not be so genera! in
other countries as Britain, yet certainly
much of the neceflary supplies, such as li
nens and woolens have been got on as good
terms in France as in England, and have
been in quantity more than equal to the
demand. By depending on one nation for
our whole supplies, fubjetts us too much
to the caprice and the fate of that nation.
Suppcfing that nation to be at war with
ourfeives or our allies, we must be much
embarrassed in our supplies, and will find it
difficult to find goods from nations who
had not provided for our demands. Sup
posing a state of bankruotcy or infurreftion
to take j,lace in the nation on which wedepend for supplies, we will (hare in their
diilreffcs.
The gentleman from South Carolina
(Mr. Smith and others) considered the
credit to which our merchants are admit
ted in Britain as more than equivalent to
the reftri&ioits we are fubjedted to by tliat
nation. It is urged that the exteniive use
we are admitted to make of Britilh capi
tal ought to have great weight in our cf
timatesof the comparative adv.mtageof our
commerce with Britain. Mr. Fincjley
begged Inave totally to differ with thole
gentlemen in opinion ; he considered the
extensive use made by our merchants of
Britilh credit as a very gieat political evil,
he said it promoted an unfavorable balance
of trade, and enables our merchants to im
port goods in greater abundance than we
need, consequently our induftrv, especially
in domestic manufactures is discouraged,
and luxury is promoted; it is an old obser
vation that the borrower is a servant to the
lender.
The consequence of the British credit
so much boaited of is, that our merchants
are many millions in debt to the manu
facturers or merchants of Britain, our
storekeepers are in proportion indebted to
tiie merchant, and country people are ;n
debt to the storekeepers for Inch manufac
tures as they could have lived Well with
out, and which many of them were not
able to pav for. Thus credit while it en
riches a few individuals occasions a ruinous
fvftem of debts and bankruptcies to per
vade our countrv from the cities to the
most remote boundaries.
But a greater evil presents itfelf to our
consideration. This credit promotes a
fyllem of British influence dangerous to
our political security. The merchant who
depends upon Britilh crcdit is necessarily
under the influence of the hand that feeds
him, the storekeeper is in debt to the
merchant and fubjecl to his influence.
And such storekeepers abounding not on
ly in all the finall towns, But in every
place of public resort, consequently this
extensive Britilh credit is a source of Bri
tish influence spread through the whole
United States.
He said, that since Congress met he had
been industrious to procure information
oil this fubjeft. He knew that before the
country people expeited such regulations
with anxiety, and he now knew that the
merchants who were able to carry on fcufi
nefs without the aid of the Britilh credit
were very generally in favour of commer
cial reftriftions. And that those who
were not in that fitmtion were generally
against them, these different principles na
turally arose from their refpettive iituati-
He exprefled some surprize that the
gentleman from Maryland (Mr. S.) spoke
of the French treaty with so little can
dour ; why did he not mention the gua
rantee of the Weft-Indies as a part of the
commercial treaty as well as the admitting
the French privateers and prizes into our
ports ? The truth is neither the one nor
the other were of the commercial parts of
the treaty. The gentleman knew that the
exertions of that nation in our behalf by
their arms and their money were the parts
of the treaty relative to the opening our
ports to their privateers, prizes, See.
He faidthe Britifhrcftri&ionsto which
we were fubjeffced, the encouragements
given to the hostile Indians, that was no
longer a secret. The letting loose the
Algerines on our commerce, a fa ft which
he trusted no member would now deny.
The refufing to fulfil the definitive treaty
or to enter into a commercial one ; all
tended to prove that this was the proper
time to aflert our own commercial rights,
not for revenge but felf-defence. The
present embarrafled state of Europe ren
dered such a measure neceflary, and en
couraged the profpeA of its being effec
tual. (To be Continued.)

arereturned. T. Dobfon, (elicits the favor
oÂ« the fubfenbers to call or fend for their vo
lumes, that they may be supplied as early as
poihble. J
The tenth tolumi of the Eiievdlooedia is
now presented to the public ; but as it makes
its appearance in an impcrfeft state, some ac
count ot the reason of that imperfection fliould
be jiren. On the Bth of September last, tlie
Pubhlher had the misfortune of having his
Printing-Office burnt down by a fire which
broke out in the neighbourhood, and a great
quantity of his printing materials destroyed
and among other articles, the Ftouiis, with
which he was printing the taÂ»lu or lo
oaritkmi, belonging to the present volume,
were melted down by the violence of the fire
As a supply of these could not be immediately
obtained, lie was under the neceflity of pi ,b
liming the volume without the e tajlei; but
hopes he (hall be able to publilh them with tin
next volume which is now io conliderable for
wardnefs.
The Publilher embraces this opportunity of
exprefling hit grateful acknowledgments to
the generous public, for the very liberal pa _
tronage with which his undertaking has been
honored; at the fame time he takes the li
berty of representing ,o fiich of the subscribers
as are in arrears, the indifpenfible necefllty of
pnnftuality, both in taking up ,he volume, as
ejrly as poflible after publication, and of pay
mg for them wj.en taken. Many of the full
fcribers having got only one, two, three, 1-c.
volumes, and several volumes remain unpaid
Thus the work hangs in all its different stages
trom the comnicnÂ«einÂ«nt; and though the im
portance of a few dollars may be but a trifle
to the individuals, yet the accumulation of
these trifles iwmd lays the Publilher under
very ftrious Â«mbarraflme>rt, and deprives him
of the nfe of many Thousands of Dollars which
at (hit time would be of very eflential ferrice
For these reasons the Publilher finds himfelf
under the neceflity of recurring to the original
terms of publication, and ia future no vo
lumes will be delivered but Â»nlv to thsfe who
take and pay to the time of publication.
