Houfc of Reprefentativcx
Thursday, Msrch 12.
The following (ketch, contains the sub
stance of the observations made by Mr.
Sedgwick when he introduced the reso
lutions, inserted in yesterday's Gazette :
After having introduced the subject,
he said, that the great object which ought
to direst our deliberations on this occasi
on, Ihould be the preservation of peace*
In the infant state of our government, and
under the peculiar circum(lanccÂ» of our
country, we have much to lose, and no
thing to gain by war. America, he said,
had progrefled in the means of happiness
with a rapidity unknown in the history of
man, and at this moment, independent of
the prefiure* of which we now complained,
& which he truiied would be of (hort dura
tion ; polfcfTed a greater (lock of enjoy
ment than was ever indulged to any other
n:ition,
This doubtless added to the injury of
disturbing our happy state, but at the
fame time it rendered it the indispensable
duty of the guardians of the public secu
rity to proceed with caution, and coolly
and temperately to examine every step
which might be taken at this important
conjuncture.
During the conflict which had convul
sed Europe, the conduct of the govern
ment had been irreproachable. Always
justâas the last appeal was mÂ»de by the
btdligerent powers, it was very correctly
determined, that unlejk we would take
part, we had m rigfct to decide on the
justice of the wagv nor tu influence its
events. IThus wifely determining and ho
norably condu&ing,the right* of neutra
lity (hould have been allured to us. But
unfortunately neither our sentiments nor
our conduct have been reciprocated by the
belligerent powers. The honor of our
country has been insulted, and our rights
& the property of our citizens violated.
Much allowance indeed ought to be made
for the operations of the passions genera
ted by war ; but after every deduction on
this account, we had much to complain
of and to demand compensation for. Tho*
peace Ihould doubtless be our object, yet
there was a point beyond which injuries
would become intolerable. That point
he hoped was not yet approached, but he
could not help remarking, that if receÂ®:
information was true, one of the bellige
rent powers, Great Britain, if not fully
determined in holtility was at lead indif
ferent to that event.
Mr. S. Then went into a minute ex
planation of some parts of his refutations,
which although necelfary to him as the
mover, yet not involving any of the great
principles of his motion, his remarks in
these particulars are omitcd.
He said peace being our objedfc, we
ought to piefent to the Belligerent pow
ers, motives of policy aud inure it to co
operate w'th confederations of justice, in
their eondudt towards us.
Ihe form contemplated would enable
the government to present a firm counte
nance of refiitance in any part of our ter
ritory where an attack might be contemp
lated. He believed, however, that the
experience of Great Britain had convinced
the world that America was unconquera
ble. No power or combination of poweif
would, he believed, be competent to that
purp >fe, or to dismember our country and
poffeii any fe&ion of it.
There was another objeA of great im
portance, to which, the proposed force
might be dire&ed, and to wnich he be
lieved it would be competent. To under,
stand the proptiety of this general obfer
vatiou, it was neceflary to review the pre
sent conduit of Gieat Britaiu ; and the
motives which produce it. That coun
tty is now ardently purfutng conqucfts
in the Weft Indies, and expels by them
to indemnify herfelf, for her expencea in
the war. Her colonial pofltflions on this
continent, and contiguous to the United
â¢>State* arc the source, from which (he
hopes to supply her profitable Weft India
colonies. l-iou> this conlideration they
w 1*- ' ICT ' and as fl>e c "tends her
~ ludla " dominions, these colonies
will become more and more the object 9f
her icgard. Ihey are contiguous to us,
and within fti iking dilhiuce of the force
contemplated by the refolutious. " Tho',
laid he, 1 hope the ambition of conquell
wilt never direct the government of this
country, yet if injuries become intolerable
and retaliation our duty, we mult inflict
wounds in thole parts where our enemy fs
vulnerable." When Great Britain (l,ould
rcnefl that so severe revenge may be tak
ei., that the means of inflicting it are al
ready in the hads of government, Ihe will
be cautious of wantonly incurring our re
leiitiucnt.aildlhe has surely nojull grounds
''(jurious con duel towatds this coun
try.
1 tiefe he said were the objects of the
force contemplated by the resolutionsâ
there would be objections to them plaufi
b.e perhaps solid ; there was one at leall
rcfpetiablc, from the motive in which it
originatedâthe jealosy of freemen, of a
uanding army, and the consideration that
a militia (hould be the forceâ the instru
ment to defend and fecurc the exiltence of
republican inttitutiong. To a certain ex
tent the principle was coired, and the iea
lotrijr well founded. This principle and
this jealousy had influenced the conduit
of the patriots to whom the defence of
America was intruded at the commence
ment of the late war. But by experience
the only unerring guide in political inves
tigation, it was discovered, that the prin
ciple was extended too farâ by it the union
was brought to the brink of ruin, and
was only saved by an immense expence of
lives and treasure. By the ftort inlift
ments of militia, they are incompetent to
long continued exertions. If inlitted for
a conhderable length oftihie, though they
â nay be denominated militia, they became
polk (Ted of all the properties which are the i
f.H.'-ce of thejeafoufy Â°f standing armies,
"'"lifted for fliort periods, just as they
assume the character of soldiers, their term
of iniillment expires. By experience it is
known that no consideration can induce
them to continue beyond the Specified
term ot serviceâhence at stated periods,
the country is left naked and defencelefs.
L th * wa S es of militia will always
exceed those which will be required to
procure a regular force. This the experi
ence of the late war taught us was in the
proportion of two or three to one ; and
the want of discipline and subordination
will always occalion a prodigious wafteof
public and private property; and What is
more important a want of the habits of
lo.diers, a lamentable wade of lives.
As long as we depend on a militia alone
for repelling foreign injury, fhortofadi
rett attack on our territory, foreign pow
ers will not believe we poflefs either the
will or the power of vindicating our rights
or retaliating their injuries : Besides when
It IS remembered, that (hould there be no
war with a foreign power within two years
and an half from the time of commencing
the lnliltments, and that time was not
thought to be too long, considering the
; a ' e Â°/ Euro pe. then the force is to be
dnbanded ; remembering too, tfiat they
are to be trained 24 days in a year, and
never but in detached corps, and that of
course during peace, they will remain dif
perled, and almost the whole time repofing
in the bosom of civil society; when these
circumstances are remembered, it will be
impossible to suppose that such a force can
be formidable to the liberties of thepeo
â¢ii"7 " to conceive that they
will suppose they pofTefs interests diftinft
from, or opposed to those of the commu
nity of which they arc a part.
It might not be improper, he added,
to ttate as far as he was able the probable
amount of the expence of the proposed
eftabli/hment. He had made a calcula
tion. The regiment is to consist of 1000
privates ; this number is purposely large,
tnat the expence of officer might belefs
one sergeant major and 50 sergeants to
Â«ach regiment, would make the whole
number of non-commissioned officers and
pnvates ioj . men. These, at 12 dollars,
for the si.it of cloaths, per annum would
make the expence in this article 12612
: and the 2 4 mnfter-days, at half
a dollar a day an equal sum, in all 25224
dollar., which multiplied by Iy, the num
ber of regiments, gives a total of 378440.
He had not accurately ascertained the
amount ri the officers' pay, but believed
it would be about 14820 dollars, making
thr l w , !lok 393.260 dollars per annum,
he whole expence of the proposed auxil
aiy or prov.i.onal troops. He called

" wt " ch we Should be able to brinj.'
20,000 men into tlx- KIJ. a number com
petent to any purpoi'e f ur which they
would be wanttd.
The resolutions contemplate as a pro
vable contnigence the propriety of laying
in embargo on American vessels and pro
â¢ib'ting the exportation of the product
n !!' ted Statcs > Jf fl^h an em
ia'P " IaJI be Â»ecefi r -iry the operation can
>e better performed by the Prelident than
3y the Legislature. In a body as num.
as the Leg,flatus, it is impossible t.
keepl a secret for any length of time, an,
the delays which the necessary forms re
imre, would be such, that the effect o
the meafnre would be loft before fimUl,
adoptedâfor every iliip and all the pro
uce which poffibiy could, would imme
iiately be put out of the reach of go
vernment. Â®
The reasons on which this idea of ai
embargo are founded, are, that Grea
Britain cannot supply her Weft Indie;
except from the United States. If thi
s in any degree true, in peaceable times
low muth more powerfully mult it ope
ate now they have a confi'derable milita
J force there to feed, in truth, withou
upphes from this country, they mult ine
stably abandon a projeit, with them i
avoume one, the conquelt of the Frencl
weft Indies.
In this iituation of affairs he believec
t would be found proper to put into th
lands of the Pref.dent a power to la
his embargo, and in a moment to preven
ill lupplies going to the Weft Indiesâ
great occasions confidence must b
epofed in the executive, and the univer
al conhdence 111 the present head of tha
lepartment, would prevent all fears of it
>emg abused in his hands.
When we are once in the situation con
emplated by the refoktions offered, an<
we are then obliged to exert the mean
n our power for o.lr defence (but he he
we ftould not be impelled to this di
greeable necessity) we can speak a mai
t â¢ "J-fj Uage to a ">' < " lc w ho may attemj
He was persuaded, that if a country
does not rdpeft itfclf it will not be
-pefled by others nations; that if a na
tion is not vigilant in guarding their rights
they soon will have no rights to guard â¢
â f they receive insults and injuries with
impunity they will fuffer injuries and in
lults without end.
1 his is not the time, fa.'d he, for fee
ble measuresâ a manly conduct ought to
be purfued-a conduct worthy of our
brave and honorable constituents: Thev
have bravery to .alfcrt and resources to
vindicate their rights.
He did not wi(h the government to
speak in the language of intimidation ;
but in the manly tone, and in the lan
[ guage of a free and independent nation ;
! cone,ous that (he po(Te(fa rights, and has
he means of defending them. We
should tell the belligerent powers, that we
can make every reasonable allowance
\ r - a , fta V f Wr : ~ That w have rights
unw 'I 0 be . the f P (>r t of wanton and
unprovoked violation. We should mark
a line, and boldly declare, that we will
not permit ,t to be transgressed. Such
firm and manly language, backed by the
means of enforcing refpeft, and retalia
thl g f njU r eS ' apac,t >' of withholding
thefupphes neceflkry for the prosecution
of a favorite object. A refpeftable and
aflive force, ready to strike in a vulnerable
quarterâsuch laguage under such circum
ltances must be heard and he trusted, would
produce the desired effect.
He had the more confidence that this
would be the cafe, when he refleded that j
Great Britain would have no possible mo
tive of mtereft, or ambition in a war with
this country. She was now draining every
nerve, and was obliged to call forth all
resourcesâ though (he might be did t0
enjoy national prosperity, yet her fubjefts
expenencedmuch individual misery. The
jntmup. f her commerce, with the
,~; d States, would doubtless add to
Jff^ arTa ? nentS : and degree

ed for the prosecution of the war. On

He next turned bis attention to the
forThV " ' ,;ch flm<:s drawn
/ " ee " tloft :of the Plan pronofed,
andexposed a firm reliance on the patri,
otjfin of the people of America, who, h
beheved, would tearfully submit and co âe

and to vindicate their national honor,
rie adverted to some observations which.
he (AAAJ'' ifina:from Mr - which
he said.did honor to that gentleman ; but
he could not agree with him iâ thinking
that a land tax, was immediately neceflary.
He believed it as yet unnecessary to touch
that great resource; and if it is unneceflary,
>t IS rot expedient, [f it mult be re.
emred to, however, he believed the peo
ple had virtue and patriotism enough to
lubmit, without murmuring.
He concluded by that the
nation of whose treatment we have a right
to complain, viewing our. refoiirces, will
refleA fenoufly on the consequence of im
poling any further injuries, and for their
own mtereft fake, will permit us to con

Extract cf a Letter-from a gentleman in
Boonlborough (Kentucky) to his friend
in this town, dated Feb. 10.
" An expedition is now on foot against
New-Orleans, under the command of Gen.

people here are confident of success. I have
taken a part in this business and lhall return
that way to Virginia, (I hope) .with a canoe

BALTIMORE, March 3.
A late Engl: !h Newspaper mentions, that
the pbjedt of the Ottoman Porte in fending
an ambalTadorto the British court, is to bring
about a peace between the combined pdwcrt
and France, on condition that the latter (hall
evacuate Nice and Savoy ; that the French
lhall renounce all ideas of conquest, or inter
ference with other Hates; and the colonial
iyftem being Incompatible with their princi
ples, that they lhall cede their East and Well
India polfclEons to Great Britain.
NEW-YORK, March 12,
While the people of the U. S. are
anxious to preserve their liberty at home,
they cannot be unconcerned at knowing
the hard fate of thofc of their countrymen,
who by being exposed to the severe and
perilous duties of the sea, are rendered at
the fame time obnoxious to, and many of
them are actually enduring the hard con
dition of Haves, to the most ferocious ene
mies to humanity.
Captain Lawrence of the Hull Packet,
was desirous of obtaining the best and most
authentic information, refpe&ing the con
dition of his unfortunate countrymen in
Algiers, obtained it at Cadiz, and now
refpectfully lays it before the American
people.âThe Americans taken by the
Aigerines, have their heads close shaved,
nor arc they allowed to wear any kind of
covering on the head: they are entirely
stripped of their apparel, and a coarse dress
given instead of it. At night they are
confined in a dungeon, and at day-light
they are led in chains to their usual work,
which is generally rigging and fitting
ships ; some are sent as navigators and pi
lots on board the cruizers, and are oblig
ed, on pain ofpunifhment, to exert them
felve3 to the utmost of their abilities.
Their food is generally bread and water,
nor is the least difference made between
sick and well, officers and men, but all
treated equally ill.
It was reported at Cadiz, that there
were several European navigators lately
gone among them, particularly one Kelly,
who was tried in Dublin for piracy ; and
that they were determined to fpcure the
western ocean next spring. The Hull Pac
ket left Cadiz with an English fleet, under
convoy of a frigate and Ooop of war. A
few days after leaving that place, two fail
passed the fleet, fleering in for the Streights,
th* sloop of war gave chace and spoke
them ; and Captain Lawrence was inform
ed they were an Algerine cruizer, and an
American ship, her prize.
SUIP MEWS.
Mr. Foster, late Mate of the ftiip Fa
vorite of Alexandria, who came paflenger
in the brig Pearl, from St. Domingo, in
foims, That the ship was nearly loaded
at Port-au-prince with a cargo of 400
hhds. of Sugar and Coffee; that Santho
nax, the civil commissioner, having tho't
fit to alter the law refpedling the mode of
collecting the duties on produce exported,
[ demanded from the Captain of the Favo
rite, payment of duties under the new re
gulations, altho they had been previous
ly laid under the law, which then exifl
ed j and on the Captains' demurring, im
mediately ordered the (hip to be unload
ed, and held a couit upon her; the Judg
es of which were composed of three peo.
pie of colour, who, in the course of a
few minutes, decided the condemnation
of the (hip and cargo, which was valued
at 30,000!. without allowing the Captain
to appeaY in the court in her defence.
Mr. Poller a!fo informs, that the only
law exiting at the place, is the will of
Santhonax, who is acting in the most ty
rannical manner, and has treated the A
inericans exceedingly ill. He obliges them
to fell what part of their cargo he pleads,
to himfelf, at his own price, and pays
them v. ith delegations or di'afts, on Mr.
Genet, which will never be honored. He
alio takes from them their thip stores, and
obliges them to purchase their fubfiltence
at the market, at exorbitant rates
Most of the white people arc iijiprifontd,
and the blacks have completely the con
troul. ' . .
Mr. Foftcr further mentionsâthe Bri.
tifh had colle&ed all their forces at the
Mole, and had gone on ail expedition- a-,
gainst Port-au-Prince, which he appre
hends, must by this time have fallen.

PHILADELPHIA,
MARCH 14.
Accounts received from Tortola at St.
Croix, mention the arrival there of a veflH
from Europe, which parted with the Jamaica
fleet, the captain of which fays, that the if-
Jand of Martinique was seen to be in flames.
1 hat he spoke an Englifti frigate off that
place, and was informed that the Britift were
in pofieflio/i of the island, except Fort Re
publicâthat Admiral Jervis, and Sir Char
lcs Grey had iflued a proclamation offering
protection to the well disposed inhabitants of
that unfortunate country, at the fame time
threatening such of the whites, as were found
in arms, to be sent away as prisoners of war
âthe coloured people, to be sent to Africa,
and the negroes to fufler instant death.
At a numerous meeting of the merchants
and traders of this City, on Tuesday
the I ith instant, at the Harp and
Crown Inn, in Third Street, in pursu
ance of an advertisement for that pur
pose.
Stephen GirarJ, Esq. in the Chair.
The following resolutions were proposed
and unanimously adopted.
Resolved, As the sense of this meeting,
that the carrying trade of the United
States, and the proper defenee of its' na
vigation, are objects of primary import
ance to the prolperity, dignity, and hap
piness of America.
Resolved, That discriminations of ton
nage duties between the (hips of nations
having commercial treaties, and being in
habits of friendly intercorfe with the U
nited States, and such as belong to nati
ons oppressing and assuming to di&ate to
America, are reasonable and just ; in or.
der to encourage arts of generality and
friendihip towards the union, and to (how
a proper sense of displeasure at a contrary
principle.
Resolved, That the citizens of Ameri
ca, owners of (hips or cargoes, concerned
ill lawful trade on the high seas, and fail
ing under the sea letters of the President,
and proper clearances of the cultom hous
es, have a right to be reimbursed the los
ses they may sustain, from any vexations
or spoliations committed by any power
whatever, in violation of the law of nati
ous.
Refulved, That additional imports on
the vefl'els, goods, wares, and merchan
dize, of any nation so offending, intro
duced into the United States, will be a
proper fund, out of which to reimburse
such lofies, and will tend more than any
thing we know of to difcountenancc and
discourage such paa&ices in future,
On motion,
Resolved, That the foregoing resoluti
ons be published.
Refolvcd, That this meeting be adjourn
ed to meet at the State House, on Tues
day flfcxt, at j o'clock, P. M. and that
the citizens in general, be invited to at
tend.
Rcfolved, That the thanks of this
meeting be presented to the chairman,
not only for his prcfent services, but for,
and 111 grateful remembrance of his dan
gerous and meritorious services rendered
to the citizens on a late melancholy occa
sion.

" I" fight of the memorial that your
Excellency lias remitted me in your letter,
No. 115 1, from the American Captains,
Henry Stephens, James Neil, and Ebe
nezer RofTeter, in solicitude for a convoy
of a {hip of war for their refpedive vefTels,
from thence to Cadiz to protect them
against the Algerine, cruizers ; his Ma
jesty has declared that there is no room
for this pretension, on account of its not
being a condition stipulated : and I advise
your, Excellency thereof, by his Majelly's
orders, that you may inform said Captains
of the fame. God preserve your Excel

PROVIDENCE, March 6.
A gentleman from Boston informsâ
That a vessel is arrived there from Bermu
da, and brings information, that instruc
tions were received at that place from the
Britilh court, dire&ing that no Amen
can vessel fliould in future be detained on
account of having French property on
board, any longer than was necessary to
unload the fameâand that no American
vessel (hould on ony account be molested.
In consequence the vessel which brings the
intelligence was immediately discharged,
and the Captain had awarded him Â£300
sterling, for detention. We further learn,
that a vessel in similar circumstances had
been discharged at Jamaica, and had arri
ved at Salem.
A correfpondcnt remarks, that the
Merchants have but little encouragement
to build (hips, fit, and fend them to sea,
and punSually pay the duties imposed on
the goods they bring home, while Congress
rcfufe, or neglect to protetl their proper
ty, by fitting a fleet for that purpose.

It it wholly unnecertary to expatiate on the
advantage,to American reader*, that this edi

any system of Geography extant. The addi
tiort of maps of the several date-, procured at
a very great expense, and from the belt ma
terials that are attainable, speaks such full
conviffcion on this fubjeft, that it would be
difrefpeft to the reader's understand ng to
suppose it requisite to enter into a detail of
