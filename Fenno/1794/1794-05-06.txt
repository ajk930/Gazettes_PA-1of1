Mr. Fenno,
IT must be very real friends
of genuine modern democracy, that the de
mand for many articles of the growth and in
vcrttion of European nations is rapidly de
clining. This cireumHance, although in
lotne cases the result of a diminilhed con
lumption; is rather to be attributed to the
mdultry 'and indefatigable zeal of several of
our own citizens. The fabrication of news
tormftaHce, may be adduced as an example
M, P Â° mt -r> I tle BrUfrels London
Morning Port, with many others of less note
slave hitherto claimed the exclusive rioht of
deftroymg .private charatfers, and palmihs
upon the,public thesnoft prepufterous, impu
dent and improbable falfehoods for truth!â
ihis monopoly, however, is now happily
done away by the spirited exertions of the
writers m the American BruJJih Gazette,
whose talents for Scandal and the Marvellous
are beyond all praise. Great merit is a rfo
due to the several manufacturing Societies
lately established throughout the Union, afld
more especially at Norfolk, where intelli
gence of the mod important nature is
fabricated, packed up, and forwarded by ex
press to the Editor of said Gazette, who aAs
as their agent in this city. The profits re
lulting to the agent from this fmgular retail
trade are not yet fully knownâthe general
opinion however is, that they are not equal
to the expence that will accrue in profecut

NATIONAL CONVENTION,
January 7.
General Weftermann appeared at the
bar, and said, " Citizens Reprefentatites,
a wound which prevents me from all exer
cise on horseback, is the motive of my
journey to Paris. I corne to present to
the Convention some remains of the sacer
dotal spoils of the bishop of Agra.jfo fam
ous for the part which he aded in the late
Catholic and royal army_l come alfÂ® to
anure you, upon my head, that of that ar
my, which was still 90,000 men ftrong
while in the diftrift of Mans, not a furgfe
combatant has remained Chiefs, officers,
soldiers, bishops, countefTes, princeflesj
& marchionefles, all perished by the sword,
by the flames, by the waves.
This dreadful example is unprecedented in
the annals of history; and Europe, aftonilh
ed, will fee that a Republic, which, like the
Everlasting Father, dicftates its laws from the
iummit of a sacred mountain, will be able
to maintain ltfelf, and to reduce, like La Ven
dee, every country which shall be foolilh
enough to form a plan of reftoratiirg Royal
ty to France." '
The President answered Weftermann, and
invited him to the honors ps the fitting a
mong the Representatives of the people? a

LONDON, Dec. it.
DOCTOR'S COMMONS.
High Court of Admiralty.
Yesterday, after a reply and rejoirtder
rom the learned Civilians on both fides
>ir James Marriott, the Judge Advocate'
ironounced judgment upon the cafe of the
hip S. Jago.
The learned Judge said that the cafe be
org the Court was pferfeftfy novel, and
herefore a novel decree mull be pronoun
ed, The numerous cases that had beer*
titrodueed in the course of the different
rguments proved the learning arid itidufc
17 of the Advocates, but had no appfrca
ion to the The novelty of the cafe
rose from the Angularity of the present
oltilities, which so much agitated the
wblic mind. -The learned Judge said
e was not bound by any jfrecedent that
ad been cited, or by tliÂ»Â» authaiity of any
nctent authors, who had Seah in learned
nd abttwfc upon the
v>,"- 1nations, and the municipal law of this or
any other country* It was that excellent
principle of common sense, that did, or
should govern all mankind, that ought to
decide the present cafe. Old books in
Greek, Latin, and English; taken from
the dusty fh elves on which thty had repot
ed for centuries, had been pressed into the
service of thi's cause; nay, Pagan; Maho
metan, Jewish, Dutch, and almost every
other writer in the world, had been quot
ed ; but their fpcculations applied just as
much to one fide of the question as the
other. Sir James, with admirable wit,
exposed to ridicule the abflruf* specula
tions of these ancient writers, and pointed
out their inapplicability to the present
cause.
Soriie of them, he said, put him in
mind of the 39 articles, which had bÂ«en
made to apply to a great variety of dif
ferent do6liir.es. Grotius had been in
troduced, -and often quoted as the Bible
of the Civilians; but it was high time to
have done with him. A gieat deal had
been said refpefting the law of nations,
but after all it was floating law. If
would have been a desirable circumftaace,
if it had occurred to the British Minis
ters, or to our Allies, to have provided
for the cafe of a recapture, like the pre
sent ; but no such provision had been as
yet made. Perhaps, before the present
cause reached its last tribunal, some new
ast or regulation might take place. In
the present cafe, the King of Spain, as
the claimant, comes and prays that the
ship might be restored, and submits to
â¢ salvage, and to the decree of the English
Court of Admiralty ; he had pledged his
Royal honor to abide by the decinon ; â
this was very flattering to the? Judge, and
ought to be considered as a good fecu
ritv.
A decree therefore ought to be made
that was consonant with good sense, with
politeness, and might tend to cement the
harmony subsisting between the courts of
England and Spain. It had been laid by
the Counsel that the law knew of no po-,
litenefs, but looked only at justice. Law
yers, it was true, were not polite, but
politeness in this cafe was good sense. Law
had been called the perfection of reason ;
but the perfection of reason was what the
law ought to be. The learned Judge,
after many observations upon the law of
nations, municip;J laws, the nature of
treaties, and policy of states, said he
(hould pronounce a provifionary decree,
which he trusted would give fatisfaftion to
both parties. He therefore decreed, that
the ship and cargo fliould be restored to
his Catholic Majesty and his subjects the
claimants, agreeable to their prayer, and
that one eighth of the value (after deduc
ting the expences on both fides) be paid
for salvage ; provided that, within fix
months, it shall be declared by his Ca
tholic Majesty, by' some public ast, that
all ships and cargoes that are, or shall be
captured by the King of Spain, together
with private ships to be fitted out, be
longing to the King of England, be re
stored upon the fame terms to his Britan
nic Majesty; otfierwife the said ship St.
Jago is to be confidcred as good and lawÂ»
ful prize to the captors.

Just, in the name of the Commit
tee of Public Safety moved, and the Con
vention adopted the subsequent decree.
Art. 1. All the Communes of the Re
public shall make out an account of the
patriots contained in each commune, to
gether with their names, places of abode,
their situation, and the lofTcs which they
have fuflained.
2. The dire<Slors of each diftrift shall
fend these accounts to the committee of
Public Safety, who shall make a report in
which (hall be pointed out the means of
indemnifying the unfortunate patriots out
of the property of persons detained as
fufpefted.
Danton wjfhcd that the division of
the little country property should be ad
ded to this measure ; and that the patri
ots who have fuflained losses should be al
lowed to cultivate it, even to the walls of
Paris. He moved that the Committee of
Public Safety, should take this suggestion
into confideiation. Agreed to.

had formerly allowed him an annual sum
of 300 livres, which had bsen withdrawal
for ttyree years.
This unhappy fnan had been taken by
a Lettre de Cachet after having served
with credit in the French army.
Tlie Convention decreed, that a peri
fion of 2000 livres should be granted to
him, and that enquiry should be institu
ted into the reason of this man's impri

One wo,lid flunk by reading the lan*,uÂ«
o the incendiaries of America, that we liv
ed under the dominion of a pope, a Snanifh
lnqUilttioii, or the dey of Algiers. The'at
tempts made to frighten their opnofers,- and
controul their opinions, rank tho Democrats
of the southern states among the molt fan
gmnafy persecutors, the popes rnd the Ne
roes of ancient times. It. is ilrange, hut true,
thatmen are always the fame proud, blood
thinly, perfecting tyrants. In all countries,
in all governments, give men power, and
they become tyrants. Opinions arc never
dangerous, to pejfecute them is always deffio
tifm. Jhe constitution and laws of America,
have no where ;aid a man (hall not believe
in the Pope, the Turkish Sultan, in Mahomet
or George 111. There is no law in America
to punilh a man for thinking a monarchy the
bcjl form of government. So long as o' ini-'
ons do not produce overt-acts against the go
vernment, the opinions are Itgtil, thev are
not crimes, they are not punishable. A'man
is under no legal or moral obligation to think
our republican government.Â« betlrr form,
tnan the government of the Six Nations or
the Chinefc. Crinus consist only in cbert
a3s : and when crimes are committed, the
lci<ws will puniili them, not men. A man
has the fame right to be a toy, an arif.ucrut
or a monarchy man, in the United States? as
has to be an antifedercU <5r oppofer of the
exjfti.'ijj government.âThe opinions of each
of these descriptions of men are equally op
posed to the general sense of America, and
equally hostile to our republican conftitotton.
It is no more a erirrre to bciievcrrrmarcby a m
good government, than it is to believe our
federal constitution a bad~one. So far ascri
m nality is concerned, the tories and ariilo
crats, if there are any who wilh our govern
ment changed to monarchy or ariiiocracy,
and the autifederals, who wish to render it
more deniocratical, are preeifely on the lame
footing. Their opinions differ from the ge
neral will. But the truth is. there no
crimes in either cafe, while opinions reft in
theory and argument. âOur government
guarantees to every man a full right to speak
his ramd freely on'all fubjt<<ls ; jnd to be in
heart a tory, an aristocrat, a Mahometan, a
Jew, a Pagan, a Jacobin or an ant federal.
Our government is a government of tniver
fal toleration. The freedom of America, its
greatefi blefim;>Â£ feenrts to every citizen the
right of thinking, of speaking, of worihip
ping and adting as he pleases, provided he
does not violate the laws. The onlvpeoole
in America who have dared o violate this
freedom, are tlie.dcmocratical
who have proceeded to threaten violence to
tories, and arijlccrats and federal republicans;
that to people not of their paity. Every
threat of this kind is an ail of tyranny ; an
attempt to abridge the rights of a fellow
citizen. If a man is persecuted for his opi
nions, it is wholly immaterial whether the
perfection springs from cne man or from a ,
society of the people. When men are dis
posed to persecute, power is always right:
weakness always wrong. Power is always
info lent and despotic ; whether exercised in
throwing its oppolers into a baftile ; burning
them at the flake ; torturing them on a rack;
beheading them with a guillotine ; or taking
them off, as at the massacre of St. Bartholo
mew, at a general Jkueep: Power is the fame
in 1 urkev as in America. When the will of
men is raifcd above /aw, it is always tyranny,
and despotism, whether it is the will of a
balhaw or of bastard patriots.

PHILADELPHIA,
MAY 6.
The faction that used to clamour for un
funded paper money now fee a legion of de
vils in a system of funded paper. The
problem may be ealily solved. Paper to
cheat with is a glorious machine. It-is a fort
jf hocus pot:us that Vnakes the lender the fer
â¢am of the borrower. The debtor cliahs
liis cPsditor, crying, I tender you this gold
ind filvejr, the printed com. If you refufe
t. you are an er.emy of your country.-â
This honejl paper iufiuence seems to be to!eraÂ«<
%!e enoughâbut paper that is once funded
that is not a tender for debt, that is the evi
dence of a just debt is full of all mifchiet'â
it is a corrupt influence. The whole mifchief
would vanish if the pledged faith of the pub
lic were broken, then our funded paper
would do for a lawful tender to pay debts. â
In a word a debt that is honestly due, and ho
nestly paid, is the spring head of corruption.
We- h?.ir that the President of the United

The late arrivals fromÃourdeauJt, though
they might have bro't accounts to the middle
of March, do not appear to fnrnilh .my I'a
tisfaiftory, or authentic intelligence. One
French paper publi.hed in this city, gives the
mod dcplorabie account of the executions
which are flill continued there, and of the
great fearcity which prevailsâwhile another
French paper fays that Bourdeaux is tranquil
âthat the scarcity has not been felt as has
been published.
There are reports in circulation that
the embinjo in France was owing to the
American vefTels having fold their cargoes
of provifioiiSt in England and other ports,
and then repairing to Bourdeaux with
calh and credit only, to load for the Uiu- |
ted States ; and that the veflels whicli ar- \
rived here, were particularly released, be- ,
cause they had.carricd provisions dire&ly

be dijlinguijhid by the following
MARKS.
Five Dollar Bills of the Bank of the
United States.
ALL that have appeared have the letter F.
1 for their Alphabetical Mark.
' The Texture of the Paper is thicker and
whiter and it takes the ink more freely than
the gentiihe paper.
The O. in the word Company is fmalter
than the M. and other letters of that word,
* so that a line extended from the top of the O,
to touch the top of the M would extend con
siderably above the range of the whole word.
In the wojd United the letters ire narrow
erand closer together than the reft of the bill
The i and fin the word promise are not
parallel, the f inclining much more forward
than the i.
The engraving is badly executed,* he strokes
ff all the Letters are stronger and the devi e
in the margin particularly is much coarfcr and
appears darker than in the true bills. Some
of the counterfeits bear date in 1791â-Where
as tfiÂ© Bank was not in Operation till Decern
ber, artd no five dollar bills were iiiued in
that year.
Twenty Dollar Bills of the Bank of North
America,
ALL that have appeared have the letter
B tor their alphabetical mark.
They are printed on a paper nearly fimtfar
to that of the couutetfeit Five Dollar Notes
above described; the engraving is bettei exe
ncted, and they approach nearer to the ap
pearance of the genuine bills.
The fine ruled lines through the word Twen
ty, in the body of the bill, are in mini ber thir
teen in the genuine bills, and but twelve in
the counterfeits.
The word Company is much like the fame
word in the Five Dollar Bills as described a
bove, the 9 being less than the to, and others
following.
There is no stroke to the t in the word North
whereas in the genuine bills the stroke is well
defined.
The letters ent in the word Twenty, to the
left hand at the bottom, do not come down to
the line, but are so cut as to give an irregular
appearance to the word, the J'w and 'hey go
ing below them.
The signature J Nixon, has the appear
Jnce of being written with lamb-black and
oil, and differs from other inks used in
printing the bills and the calhier's signature.
It is supposed these forgeries were committed
111 some of the Southern States, a.s all the coun
terfeits that have appeared, have come from
1 hence, and two persons have been apprehend
ed in Virginia,on suspicion of being the author
of them.
The reward of ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS
Â«vil| be paid to any Person or Persons who lhal
discover and prosecute to convi&ion the several
offenders of the following defÂ«*riptions or any
of them, v'iz.
The peifon or persons, who manufactured
the paper on which the Bills are printed.
The person or persons, who engraved the
plates.
The printer or printers, Â©f the bills.
Every person who has a&ed as a principal in
any other way, in the counterfeiting and utter
ing the fa id bills.
Philadelphia, March 28,1794
Jlpril 22, 1794,
Other counterfeit bills
of the Bank of the United States have appeared
in circulation.
The denomination is of TWENTY DOL
LARS,and the alphabetical mark is the let
ter B.
They may be distinguished from the genu
ine by the following MA'ftKS :
The paper of the counterfeits is of a jgjbri
tender texture and glofley farface than the
genuine, and there is no water mark in them
The letter C. in the word Cashier, in the
true bills is strongly nvarked, whereas in the
counterfeits, the wfihle tester is a fine hair
stroke, evidently in an unfinifhed state. The
etter a in the wo*d deinand, is badly formed
an the whole word ill done, and there is 110
comma at the end of it, as there is in the
genuine bills.
, marginal device, is much daikfcr in
' e J in the gehtrihe bills owing to
e Â»ia e strokes being coarser, much nearer
oget er,> and consequently much more nu
merous. This difference strikes the eye at firft
view. J
nnrt IT* rf<Ward of Â°NE THOUSAND
UULLARS, will be paid for apprehertdiiHr, &
prosecuting rÂ° convi&ion the several above
tLT in fefpeft to this, as to
