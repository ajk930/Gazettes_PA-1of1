HAGUE, April 2.
A (hocking in dance of brutality was
exhibited in a foldierof the 14th regiment,
on. the night of Saturday lalt : he, with
two of his comrades, went to a peasant's
house in Wallaing with an intent of plun
dering it; but, on the peasant's remon-
Inating, and declaring he would complain
to the commander in chief, he drew a pis
tol and (hot him through the shoulder, of
winch wound he langui/hed till Monday
morning, when he diejl. His royal hi?h
nels, the commander in chief, on being
informed of the circumstance, offered a
reward of 30 guineas and a free pardon,
with his chlcharge, to either of the men
who were his accomplices, or the money
to any one who could discover the offend
er. One of them immediately turned
king s evidence, and a general court mar
tral is ordered to fit to-morrow, when
there is not a doubt remaining but that he
will meet with his deserts.

Legendre denounced several pretended In

that they had jull discovered fadls againit
Marat and Chalier, whose busts they order
ed the citizens to break or conceal. He con
ceived that this outrage belonged to the con
fpiracv which had been defeated, aiid which,
not being able to conlnmrfiate the designs it
had meditated, wished, in return, to tarnish
the memory of the principal martyrs of li
berty, and thus drive the people to despair,
by iifiprefling them with an idea, that we

Declaration of the King of PruJJia, to the
German Empire, on his fecejfwnfrom the
present Continental Confederacy.
1 Ihe period being arrived 111 which li-'s
s Pruflian Majesty is forced to discontinue
taking that active part in the present war,
which hitherto has been the effect of his
generosity and pure patriotism ; on ac
count, and in consideration of what, is
owing by Ins Majesty, to the preferva
tron of his own eltates, and to the welfare
of his fubjefts, his Majesty thinks it par
ticularly his duty to lay-before their High
nesses the Co-States of the German Em
pire, tht real caules and'true motives by
which he was induced to take such a re
, solution.
, At the time when the French nation,
in the unfortunate delusion of imaginary
liberty, had not only diffolvcd every tie
of civic ovder amongst themselves, but
also meditated the subversion of the re
pole and welfare of other nations, by tilt
introduction of their Anarchic Horrors
and in fact, had already fallen in an hos
tile manner on such territories of his Im
perial Majesty, and of the German Em
pire, as were nearest to them, his majes
ty thought proper to unite his just arms
with those of his Imperial Majesty, and
afterwards with those of the whole Ger
man Empire, and those of his other al
lies, in order to set bounds to the deftn.c
ti.ve enterprizes of a delirious nation, and
to restore peace and happiness to those as
guiltlels as highly endangered dates,â
object was ever the guide of the
aims of his Majesty down to this present
moment, and more impreflive on his
mind; m proportion as the maduefs of the
trench augmented, and the danger of all
Germany hecame more imminent. The
effort* of Jus Majesty to set a boundary
againit this mighty toirent of iU-forrune
on the German Territories, were, it is
true, at firft but proportioned to the dan
ger, but soon exceeded the utmost of his
ability Jhe war was not a war with a

means, without utterly ruining his *

His Majesty, however, Ml temafned
deeply impressed with a patriotic hoj* J
being able ft,ll to lend help and *
eft,on, and that with ii.creased force to
he German Empire; and to be enabled
to do this, he entered into a ne^ociat,

cipal points of which were, beUs tf,

it was also declared to the Diet of ,W
! Empire, and the Circles above mention,
ed, that in cafe these frank and free pro
pofals were not acceded to by the Â£,W
ror, his Ma,efty would be compelled to
withdraw the greatest part of J,is troo. â 
and to leave the empire to its Fate. '
Several States have made Declaration,
fiiitable to the pre/ Ting circumltaDces in
which they, and the whole Empire â cx
placed ; ,n particular his EMora! High
ness of Mentz, full of exalted and patrio.
tic lentiments towards the Empire, cpm .
plied w,th every requisition relative (o t t,e
uibfiftence of the Pn:fiian Troops which
dependw upon him, and iumMnpedin im
mediate Congress of the Six Circles.
His Majesty entertained a just txpefta-
Hon, that Jimilar good conferences
would every where have flowed from h : s
Patriotic intention and his hard .earned
merits in his iormer defence of the whole 1 â 
Empire. Every retrofpeft 'fefemed to
confirm these hopes; op one fide, thepaft
afforded the admonifhingpiftufe of the
dreadful torrent of an all subverting ene
my ; on the other, the noble and heroic
stand of the Pruflian army, and the im
merife facrifices of the blood of his war
riors, aud the tfcafurtes of Ms domin'oris,
made by the magnanimity of his Pruflian
t ajeity. Even then that army was
(landing on the banks of the Rhine, the
Bulwark of the whole empire, and to
which the enemy did not dare to pene-
Irate ; but the subsistence of that anny t
undertaken by the whole Empire, was
the sole condition under which it long
er cou'd be effective, and which the phy
sical impofliUility of Pruflia alone bearing
the burthen, did abfoliTtely oblige Prufiia
to infill upon. Was it acceded to, so as
the future afforded the consolatory prof
peft of his Majesty acting with that
known alacrity-Â»-rhat well proved fidelity,
in the defence of the Empire, and the
protection of its Conflitution, to the ut
most of his power ? But every Impartial
Obfe
n-er might have easily anticipated jhÂ£-
confcquences of the refufal rtf the requit
ed subsistence, and the return of the Prus
sian troops into his Majesty's own Hates.
I hen might the over-powerful and dcliii
ous enemy ravage, u controlled, through
out the Empire, and with plundering ar.d
murderous hands, unbridled and unlimit
ed, bear down the Germans, their huf
banjry, all law, order and propeitv, fhb
vert with anarchic abominations, the con
stitutions of more Imperial (tates, anni
hilate Pi inccs and Nobles, erase the Tem
ples of religion, and drive from the nearli
of Germans their natural love of virtue
order, by the aids of the feducHve
allurements of licentiousness, and the pre
cepts of an unfeeling immorality.
All these and limilar observations, so
simple and so obvious as they were, did,
nevertheless not fuccttd in bringing the ar
rangement for the fjibftftrnce of the army
to a just couchiiion. This proposal was,
besides this, fufficiently connected with
anoiher arrangement, which his Majeity
had clefigned to offer the confederate pow
ers, but which it did notfeem good to his
- frImperial Majesty to comply with, and
witch other States did alio not approve.
Moreover, this proposal gave rite to an
crceptiorc, which, after so many and me
ritorious actions, such unparalleled facri
ficcs, which his M.ijelty had already made,
be, in troth, had no rt-fon to expert,
and on which his Majeliy, not without
much sorrow, finds it his duty to make
lome remarks.
The inmmoning of the fix circles, by
theeleftorof Mcntz, has been represent
ed as irregular, though in fa ft it is ftriftly
ccnftitutional. Measures there were pro
moted 1 precifeljr contrad'.&ory to the nego
ciations for the fubftifence, and the uni
itrM arming of the peafahts was resolved
on, though it is plain, that such a mea
fuve is as inefficient as dangerous, and
compfeatly adverse to the objett proposed
âinefficient against ati enemy who prefl'es
forward in a mass with an insanity of
Fury, approved Tafticks, and a numerous
ArtilleryâDangerous, tecaufe, when the
Peafaatis armed, and brought away from
h ; 4 ordinary mode of life, the enemy may
easily become his moll dangerous seducer,
and finally adverse to the object proposed,
becaule fuck an armament is wholly incorn- I
patibfewith the fwbfiftence
of diiciplined armies. These reasons,
which flowed from the molt sincere con-
Tiftion of uis Majesty, have been represent
ed in the molt odious colors ; and the molt
falfe and scandalous motives have been at
tributed to him, for his diflcijt. to this
meafnre ; âand, in order to prevent the
arrangement of the subsistence, ptojefts
of extending his Dominions, of feculari
zrng eccleliallica! territories, and of op
pi effing the emp-i e, have beed rumoured
to have been by him iii contemplation ;
Â«.r:d of which his Majeftv's known Patri
ot ism, and acknowledged virtues, will
form the be Li contradiction.
After what :Â» past, every hope of the
Subiiflencc being acceded to, being tioiV
vamfhed, " His Majesty does now re
" mince the fame, and also every Refn
" lution of the Empire and of the Cir
" cles relative thereto. His Majesty has,
" therefore, taken the Resolution no lon
â " ger to grant his Protection to the Ger
" man Empire :â¢âBut, to order his Ar
" my, (excepting twenty thousand Aux
" illaries, according to different treaties)
" instantly so return to his own domin
" ions."
At the fenae tmt that his Majesty finds
himfelf f,impelled to withdraw a portion
of his Troops from the defence of those

the most earned wilhes, that those con
ferences he lias above alluded to may not
take place, but that the exertions of his
Imperial Majesty, and of the Empire,
may eventually insure to both a full indem

To his Majesty remains the i'ti(f confuta

Ids part made such facrilices to the de- j

OBSERVER No. XXI.
Mr. Fenno,
THE Theatre, at Mrs. Marshall's benefit,
last ttetiirtg, was more thoroughly; filled,
than it ever has been, since it was opened,
Mrs. Marshall in Juliet, and Mr. i ennel
in Romeo, did great justice to their parts. â
1' Ir. Chalmers, rather over acted Mercntio;
to cxprels the spirit and.fire in that charac
ter is extremely difficult. Mr. Chalmers's
tuition has heretofore so well accorded with
the Qbfe'rv r's taste and opinion, that he
;nore freely hazards the above remark.
t he Obfervcr- has hitherto gratified the
feelings of his own heart, in noticing the
beauties of performances - and performers,
rather than their faults : he has been happy
tp fee many inaccuracies corrected. Some
actors, who might have been reprehended at
firft, how deserve commendation .and ap
plause, and all are improved since the 'New
Theatre was opened.- -'.those performers
who have not been mentioned by the Ob
server, will umlerfta*<i, as Â»,gcneral rule, the
;il?nce, is meant as an admonition, this is
how ver true, with some exceptions, which
'hall be detailed, in future numbers.-âThe
txrfocmafMse of Rcmeo and Juliet, last even
ing, was not, when taken in all its parts
jood; many scenes Were lir'elefs, especially,
that when Juliet is discovered in her bed,
A'llh the appearanee of death.
Tlie Funeral procefiion, and Dirge in sth
Jpcnt the highlit applause; nothing of
the kind, has exceeded it.âThe vocal per
fgnpers in the Dirge, all did well, but Miss
Braa:!hurft, excelledâthe iijie of her part,
was happily accommodated to the unrivalled
excellency of her voice, and method of per
forming.
Mr. Finch was justly forgiven, for want
of recolleiStion last evening ; it is to be pre
! Sc . "Ot faon want the exercik of
aifimilar indulgence.
. Tlie well known plays of <Â£ Every one has
his fault " and "No fqng no fuppe*," are
to be up on Friday evening, for Mr. Dar
!ey s benefit ; his deserts are too much rivit--
ted in the minds of all who have heard him,
to need a commentâThe plays and enter
taii ments, are of the firft description, for
the lovers of Dramatic excellence,
â  âMrs. Whif&ck, Mrs. Morris, Messrs.
1 ennel, Chalmers, Moreton and Whitlock ;
are the pnn '?al performers in the Comedy',
and Mr. Bates, in a different call of charac
ter, from that which has generally delighted
his audience. After naming this group of
performers, the Observer cannot add an in
<du':emetit, to attend on Friday evening.

Decree of accusation againji Danton.
.1-.EGENDRE. "I our of our cblleagoes were
arretted last night by order of your commit-
The celebrated Danton is one of themj
I know not the names of the other three. If
they arc guilty, I will be the firft to call for
their pumlhment j but you ought to hear
them. I am pure, and believe Danton to be
as pure as myfelf."
He was interrupted by noiseâA member
called to the President to keep order. The
President laid he would not fuffer freedom of
speech to be infringed ; that this day would
. b - glomus to liberty ; and that the people
and poftenty would judge the Representa
tives of the people.
IfCgendre resumed. He feared that private
animosities were going to facrifice men, who
nad rendered great services to the resolution.
He spoke of his own connections with Dan
lo" ' Â°f what Danton had done in 1792
| when rainifter of justice ; andcon eluded with
moving that the deputies arrested last niirht
ftopld be heard at the bar. This motion was
heard with some applauses.
Fa yam thought there ought to be no ex
cepts to general rules : and that the laws
ought to be the famfe to Danton as to elhc-r
persons. Men were to be tried by the whole
of tjieir conduct, not by their conduct at par
n utaf periods. TÂ»-e committees were fcwrfH
to report the cautes of arreit within tv jnty
t four .'.ours, arid .h. rti'ore Ik ir ov.ed thai Jic
partus Brreftcil (ho>_fd n'ot-oe Jieaid
i Roberfjjierrtâ" From these diAurban
- ces, for a long time unknown to the as
; fembly, it is evident that a grand inter
_ eft is in question, viz. Whether certain
men (hall be more powerful than their
j country ? Why else is this motion, which
; was rejected when made by Dauton in fa
vor of Chabot and Bazire, now applauded
â  by some individuals ? I repeat it, the ques
tion is, Whether or not certain ambitious
men- shall be stronger than Liberty ? What
then ! shall we have made so many facrifi
ocj only to fall under the yoke of intrigues?
.Little do I regard the eulogies which peo
ple beltow oh themselves and their friends.
No more; do we alk what a man has done
at this or that period; we aflc what has
been his conduct during the whole of his
political career. Legendre pretends not
to know the names of the deputies arrett
ed. Knows he not that Lacroix his Friend,
is of the number ? He affedts ignorance,
becatife he kapwji he cannot express the
name of Lacroix but with shame. He
chufes rather to fpeakof Danton, the in
timaie friend of Lacroix, because the
name of Dauton is less offenfive. We
lhall now fee whether or not the Conven
tion can break in pieces an idol. Could
not all that was said of Danton be said of
BufTot, Hebert and Chabot ? They were
at certain periods, the defenders of Li
berty : Why then fliould Danton be al
lowed a privilege which was denied to his
companion Fabre d'Eglantine ?
" Attempts are Made to alarm you on
the abtife of power : What have you done
which you have not done freely, which
has not contributed to the salvation of
your country, which has not drawn down
upon you the blefiings of the people ? It
is feared that individuals may be facritked.
Do you then dittruft that justice which
constitutes the people's hope ? I do de
clare that whosoever trembles at this cri
sis, is.guilty.
_ " Me too they have tried to intimidate.
The friends of Danton have ivrjtten, that
if Danton be overthrown, I mull perish
under the stroke of the aristocrats. They
have imagined that connexions might in
duce me to divert the course of justice.
What fignified to me the dangers that
might threaten ? My life is my country's,
my heart is free from reproach, and above
all fear. .
" I was also the friend of Petion, of
Roland, of BrifTot; they betrayed their
country, and I declared against them.
Danton wiflies to take their place; Dan
ton, in my eyes, is only the enemy of his
countryâThe guilty are not so numerous
as they would have us believeâthe molt
criminal are those who would raifc up idols
and domineerers. To propose a course
with some members, not allowed in behalf
of others, is an insult to liberty. The
cajufeof the guilty can be pleaded only by
their accomplices. 1 move the previous
question on Legendre's motion,
Barrere represented the necessity of
having only one measure for the punifti
ment of traitors. If the deputies arrett
ed were to be heard at the bar, the Con
vention vrill be only an aristocratic senate.
Such Verfallity of principle would be a
direct censure of all their former proceed
ings. _
The previous question was put and car
ried.
Report of the Committee of Public Welfare.
St. Just â" The Republic is not in
Men, but in 1 hings. There was a fac
tion in 1790, which had for its tendency
to put the Crown on the head of Orleans
â"-there was another, to preserve it on the
heads of Bourbonsâthere was a third, to
beltow the Crown upon the House of
Brunfwickâthere was a fourth faction
that bade defiance to all, which now wan
ted money, then power, and'conduced
the Revolution as theatrical intrigue.-
Fabre was at the head of this fa&ion ;
he' (ported with feelings; he ltudied men,
and spoke every man in his own language.
Each faction had its creatures, and their
general with was the difTolution of the
Convention, and all gtfod patriots were
cast off. This fly faction waited to pro
nounce between viitue and crime, till the
[ victory should have been decided. Chau
mette . sent at firll 30,000 livresto his fa
ther, arid told him to purchaie neither any
national property, nor any other effects
to hide, his money, and nothing with it
There has been a faction winch wanted to
i untio the national reprefen tatioti,eithJ! by
' Â» I
i renewing or difioking it. What! Sin
- Eu rope does not doubt that Danton and
Lacroix have stipulated sos liberty, should
we difl'olve it ? iJanton, thou hail conspi
red witli Mirabeau, Lameth and Dumou
rier: After the death of Mirabeau, tliou
only artpearedft in the mafTacre of
the Champ deMars: Thouback
edft the petition of Laclos; the zealous
patriots opposed it, and thou helpedft to
digest it. Fabre, thou faidft, compound
with the court; and he who could be guil
ty of such a crime, could be no Republi
can : thou didst aflbciate with Lacroix,
who, for this long time pall, has been
known as a corrupted manâ-he never
spoke once the truth within these walls..
Sure, Danton thou hail praised Du
mourier ; thou halt taken his part in this
Tribunal; thou would ft listen to any par
ty ; thou ga'veft advifce to undo liberty.â
1 hou didst fay that thy heart could not
bear hatred ; ait thou not guilty of not
hating the enemies of liberty? Haft thou
Hot sent an Ambaflador to Petion and
Buzot in Calvados ?
Letters addrefled by the Spanilh Ambafla
dor to the Duke of Alcudia bear, that thou
waft fufpeifted of having had conversations
m the Temple with wife and the daugh
j ter of Louis Capet; the foreigners learned
their interest. The fame Ambaflador wrote
at another time, " The renewal of the com
| mittee is a plague to us." It has been said,
that the Revolution, like Saturn, devoured
all its childrenâNo, it lhall only devour its
enemies ; it ihall not facrifice a single Patri
otâit <'iall only immolate conspiracies. Those
men already accused us of wilhing to dis
solve the national representation. Did they
deem it a crime, for having prosecuted and
immolated the BriiTots and Chabots ? Be'
therefore inflexible j prosecute severally all
those whom I denounce: they have never
j Been patriotsâthey were aristocrats, and
more artful than those of Cohjerltz; you
W1 teach people to be modefl, and to hate
vain ce&brity. Frenchmen j be happy and
free: hate the enemies of the Republic, but
be in peace among yourfelyes. You will,
learn by this example, not to run after re
nown ; be like the Supreme Being which
.harmonizes the world without shewing it
felf! The public welfare is all; those whom
I denounced, never had a countryâthey
grew rich by crimes.

â¢parallel, the/inclining much more forward
than the i.
The engraving is badly execuied,the strokes
of all the Letters are ft longer and the device
in themargin particularly ismuch coarser and
appears darker thin in the true bills. Sonje
ot the counterfeits bear date in ijgiâWheie

Twenty Dollar Bills of the Bank of North
Anterica.
ALL that have appeared have the letter
18. for their alphabetical mark.
They are printed on a paper nearly similar
to that of the couuterfeit Five Dollar Notes
above described; the engraving is bcitei exe
ucted, and they approach neaier to the ap
pearance of the genuine bills.
The fine ruled lines through the word Twen
ty, in the body of ihc bill, are m number thir
teen in the genuine bills, and but iwejve in
the counterfeits.
The word Company is much like the fame
word in the Five Dollar Bills as defer ibed a
bove, the o being less than them, and others
following.
There is no stroke to the t in the word North
whereas in the genuine bills the stroke is well
defined.
The letters tnt in the word Twenty, to the
jleft hand at the bottom, do riot couie down to
the line, but are to cut as to give an irregular
appearance to the word, the Tut and go
ing below theiri.
The lignature Nixon, has the appear
ance ol being written with lamb-black and
oil, and dlfie/s Irom other inks ulcd in
printing the bills and the cafliiei's lignatuie.
It is iuppol'ed toigeries were committed
ill some of the Southern States, as all the coun
terfeits that have appeared, have come from
thence, and two perlons have been appichend
ed in Virginia, on suspicion of being the author
of them.
