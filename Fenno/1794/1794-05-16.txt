' FROM THE CENTINEL.
Mr. Russell,
Having been favored 'with a copy of the
following letters, I fend them for insertion
in the Centinel; they contain informs
tion,wort y public uo'ice.
Algiers, lglh December, 1793.
Honored Sir,
WE the fubferibers, in behalf of our
selves, and brother-fufferers at present,
captives in this city of human mifeiy, re
turn you our sincere thanks, for your
communications of the 29th ult. and for
the provilion you have been pleased to al
low us, in order to alleviate somewhat
our fufferings in our present situation.
We have drawn up, and signed two
petitions, one to the Senate, the other
to the House of Representatives, and we
(hall eiteem it, among the many favors
you have rendered us, that you will please
to forward thefc petitions to their respec
tive address, so that no time may be loft,
but that they be laid before the Repiefen
tatives of our country, hoping that the
United States, will fully provide funds
for extricating from Captivity,and restore
us to our country, families, friends and
<<3 W
connections.
We have pcrtifed with sentiments of
fatisfa&ion, and approbation, your me
morial to the regency of Algiers, and
have to observe, that its contents fully
coincide with our fentimente on this busi
ness, which we trust, in the Almighty,
will terminate to the honor and interelt
of our common country, notwithstand
ing the insinuations, (of others in this
quarter) to the prejudice of the United
mw&uot
States.
We trust, and hope, that the United
States will adopt such effectual plans, in
order to pi event any more of our BreÂ»
thren, (haring our unhappy fate, which
unavoidably must happen, if some speedy
and decisive means is not immediately put
In execution, as we understand the Fer
tugueze truce, with this Regency, w;:Â»
agreed on for one year.
What damps our spirits in some degree,
ii, that we are informed, that the plague,
that fatal, and tremendous dilorder has giv
en its awful alarm in the country adjacent.
And as your unfortunate countrymen were
confined during the night time, in tile
Slave-Prisons, with fix hundred captives
of other nations, that from our crowded
situation, we must be exposed to this con.
tagious disorder which neceflilate the
fubferibers, to intreat you Sir, that in this
cafe, those our friends, and of influence
in this Regency, will be authorised by
you, and fitir honored countrymen, Mr.
Carmichael, and Mr. Short, to have a
house taken for the residence of the Ame
rican matters and mates, and if poflible,
the mariners, to (hield them from the
threatening (lorm of mortality, and dan
i g er -
m&rthtf
We make no doubt, but in cafe of the
Almighty's Wrath, visiting this city o r in
iquity, but the Dey and Regency would
acquiesce to the proposed plan of humani
ty, which would be establishing an exam
ple for the general welfare ofmmkindâ
aud would to pofhrity be recorded to the
immortal honor of the United States.
The fame time, honored Sir, and friend,
be you allured for your consolation, that
we the Amer'can Captives, in this city of'
Bondage, will bear our fuffe-ings with!
fortitude, and resignation, as becoming a
race of men endowed with superior fouls in
adversity.
We are much indebted to Monf.
Skjoldebrand, and Brother, his Swedish
Majchy's Agent 6, in this city, for their hu
maoiiy, and attention to the American
Captivei, and feel ourselves particularly
obliged to you, for recommending us : o
the good offioe9 of Consuls Skjoldebrand,
and Mr. Mace, whom you mention to u?
as friends.

My d?ar Sirs,
I HAVE been favored by the receipt of

from adjaccnt,countries, where it is al

to concur with you In sentiment, that in cafe

in order to endeavor by al! human precauti

WHEREAS the Government of
Greet-Britain has cruelly and invariably
made the proiperity of other nations a
mark fur the a (Faults of her naval and mi
litaiy preparations; (he has with an in
difcriminnte hand, pillaged'theiriend, and
plundered trom the ehemy, spreading de
valuation wherevei (he went, and gaining
the earth Vvith the blood of the innocent.
And whereas (he commenced a war
againlt America, contrary to the'princi
ples of nature, and carried it on ill viola
tion of all the sacred maxims of truth, hu
manity and julticeâhas violated the ex
ptefs llipulations of her treaty of peace,
made with the United States, by refilling
to relinquish cur western poits jâ.(he has
pluudered our property on the high seas,
captured our seamen, ' and barbarously
compelled them to bear arms against a
cause which they had previously defended
with their blood, thereby depriving us of
one of our moll valuable resources of na
tional and commercial itrength : .lhe has
defrauded us in our commerce, has excit
ed pirates and savages to harrafs and dis
turb us by sea and by land! In a word,
has in all her conduct avowed an iuplaca
ble enmity against us.
Rtfobvcd, Therefore, that we -eonfider
the measures of the Britiih government
ever hostile to the cause of liberty, and in
imical to the rights of mankind ; and that
we will at the risque of our lives and for
tunes, itand ready to support the/govern
ment of the United States, in whatever
measures {he may adopt to revenge the
injuries done to America by that nation.
And whereas, it appears to be the ge
nius and essence of our government, that
our Reprefeqtatives in ihould
meet together, with the lentiments and
temper, and ad: from the ienfe of their
conltituentStf
Refohed, Therefore, that we conceive
the government of the Union authorised
<5B principles of felf-defence as well as by
the laws of nations, not only te sequester
all debts due and owing from the people
of the United States to Great Britain, to
gether with all Britilh property within
the United States, but also to issue let
ters of marque and reprisals of their ves
sels on the high seas.
D. HUMPHREYS.
Refohed, That we highly approve of
the measure already adopted by the ge
neral government, to indemnify our na
tion aqd its citizens for the lofles sustain
ed by piratical robbers; and only lament
that such steps were not earlier taken to
check the insolence of our inveterate ene
my.
Refohed, That the people of Georgia,
as well as all others of the United States,
ought to imbibe the humane and generous
example of the inhabitants of Philadel
phia, in contributing with a bountiful
hand to the relief of those of our unfor
tunate fellow-citizens, who languish un
der the horrors of Algerine captivity.
Refo/ved, That we are imprefled with
a bigh sense of the spirited and patriotic
firmnefs with which Mr. Madison, Mr.
Dayton and others who have brought for
ward and supported measures calculated
to defend our dearest rights, and to re
venge the injuries done to us, by a na
tion who has carried her devallation to the
remoteil corners of the globe.
And whereas at a time when the def
truftive aimies of Great Britain had in
vaded our country, spreading horror, car
nage and. civil discord among our citizens,
the people of France engaged in onr
cause, aided us in our difficulties, partook
in our ftifferings, and held forth the hand
of assistance to save us from slavery.
And whereas, that people ltill continue
to ltruggle in the like glorious contestâ
Resolved, therefore, That we deem the
cause of France the common cause of all
true republicans; and that we ought to
flee to the afliilance of our brethren to
whom we are bound in all the obligations
of gratitucL, friend/hip, and alliance, for
getting a neutrality which we have hither
to nnrtuittfljj but ineffectually, been care
ful to support.l
1 y./j of Apiil, 1 794, purfnant to the
order oj a preceding meeting held at the
fame place, Mr. Powell in the chair.
The committee exhibited the following de
clarations and resolutions ; -which on mo-
Tim, were read and agreed to.
Resolved, That it is our opinion that
no 1 terms of rcftitution, accommodation,
or pacification be Illteiied to on the pa.t
of America, from the perfidious govern
ment of Great Britain/ until (lie withdraw
her fleets and armies from aiding in a Imf
tile manner against the people of France
ârelinquish our Western Polls, call home
het'bloody incendiark a/from amongfl their
brothers the savages, and redeem our
countrymen, whom (he has basely sedu
ced into Algerine captivity.
Refelved, That copies of the forego
ing resolutions be transmitted to out De
legates in Congrrfs, Â»nd that they be also
piiblifhcd in the Gazette of the State :
And that John Milton, Abraham Junes,
and William Williamfon, be a Commit
tee' for that ptnpofe.
By Order of the Meeting,
JOHN POWELL, Chairman
Mr. M'Milan,
NOTWITHSTANDING the above
resolutions were adopted by a majority of
the Citizens prcfent on the igth inlianf;
yet as the foliowiug refojutions were pro.
duced at the meeting, but were by afmall
majority and by some means prevejitcd
from beiug fairly submitted in competi
tion with the others ; and as they are n6t
only more expreflive of onr own fetiments,
on the present occaiion, but of those of
a very large and respectable part of the
community, we conceive it our duty to
.have them pubjilhed along with the otheij.
âBecaufp, in exprefling our sense of tjie
injures our Citizens have .received from
any other nation, we pfcfef-the language
of firfnnefs and decision, to indilcnmi

WHEREAS the United States of?
America have, tinee their etfiltencc as an >,
independent nation, mariifefted in thÂ«r
intercourse with the witole world; a dis
position the molt friendly and liberal, and
especially in Shewing an inclination to for
get the injuries fullained in their glorious
Itruggle -tor independency, by allowing
the fubjgps of Britain tQ participate-equal
ly with others, in the moll valuable,
branches of their trade, unencumbered
withthofe reftri&ions and disabilities which
reftntment might have dictated. The
government of that country' difregardir.g
this gener6us and conciliatory conduit on
our part, has uniformly dilcovered the
molt deep rooted enmity again!! us :
By retaining poflefiion ol the weftcrn
polls, contrary to the itipulalionsLof her
treaty with us:
By refilling to enter into any arrange
ments, by which the advantages file de
rives fiom her commercial intercom fe with
us, might be reciprocated :
By lecretly fomenting discontents a
mong the Indian tribes on our frontiers,
and by encouraging and supporting them
in perpetual acts of hoftiliiy agaiuft our
defencelefs citizens:
By exciting the Algevines and the
other piratical States of Barbary to at
tack and destroy our trading vefiels,
whereby some of the most valuable and
important branches of our foreign trade
jirt almolt annihilated, and many of our
fellow citizens reduced to the moll wretch
ed captivity :
By having unfitly and piratically au
thorized the seizure of our (hipping on
the high seas, many of which, with their
cargoes, have been condemned and fold
without even the color of a pretence that
they were engaged in a traffic, consider
ed as contraband hy the known usage of
nations.
She has caused our feamcn to be im
prisoned, and in many inllances forced <>n
board her own ships of war, by which
means (independent of the unexampled
cruelty of the measure) we may, in cafe
â¢of emergency, be deprived of one of the
surest aud mod important means of nati
onal defenceâtherefore,
Resolved, That while we are sensible of
the bleltings of peace (provided it can be
secured to us by honorable and worthy
means) and though we wiih to avoid a
war ; yet wc are willing to ehcounter it
with all its attendant calamities, rather
than tamely submit to the uitjuft reftri&i
ons attempted to be imp olid on us by the
imperious spirit of the Britifti govern
ment.
Resolved, That immediate ard effectu
al meafurcs ought to'be taken, to secure a
â full and complcat irldWhr,iiicOjt>n for the
lofles fuliained by our citizens in cor.fo
quence of the fu'zme and detention or

For the Gazette of ihe United States
Mr. Fenvo,
If any individual of our family had'Wn
refufed an office, in order that a different
man tright have it, I could fee iiivifible
tilings and swear/to them as confidently as
any Antitedtral Printer can do-.âl wotjd
fil! rriy newspaper with abuse J>f the great
officer who refuted the officeâl would
call tlie true friends'of government B'ritifh
agents, a paper junto, monarchy men. &c.
But as 1 haveafked nothing of t)ie Pre
sident, and of course he has refufed me
nothing, 1 fee in his character, the por
trait of the Firll Citizen in the World.
1 am one of the public, and have seen
with impartial eyes ttie villainous schemes
which have been praftifed to deceive and
infiame.us agsjinft. the tr.uly virtuous part
of Cpngrefsâto obstruCt negotiation, and
thereby to secure a cerjain war, and jil
to go on diforgacifing our govern
ment, and preparing our country tor such
a state of anarchy ,ps has but one known
example, and not one known remedy.
Thel e is a great deal of truth, which ought
to be told, refpefting this faitiorâheir
hiltory in Mr. Luzerne's day should be told
âThe fpriiigs of action lince that period,
and during this session, however hidden,
should be expiated. The mod vile and
wicked Press that has disgraced any city,
has poured forth 3 stream of calumrty and
lies ; but (Truth will prevail at last.
The cry of foreign influence has been
laifed by a party, the known, and proba
bly, the hired creatures and tools of a fo
reign eniiflary : A party who villify and
refill our own government ; who cxprefs
on all occr.fions, hatred, rage, and abhor
rence against it. Thefcarcthe men who
cry foreign influence.
Agaifift whom is the cry ? The "paper
junto, the monarchy-men, Britilh agents,
&c. Do&or Moore has obfervcd, that
in general, the only way to judge of the
IkJll of a physician, is his good sense on
common fubjefts. If he talks like a fool
on topics that every one ought to under
flar.d, we may he lure he not an Efcu
lapius in his profeflion. The fame mav he
laid, of political men : Their tenets and
views are often disputed, and there is no
tcil to t,rv them by. The supporters oF

of unspotted private chara&ors, who prac

a vehicle of his fentimvnts to tl.c -publ c :
his long ftlence, may not want apology io
much :s his former bfei-vatious, yet the de

at the New Theatre; B1 health forms the
only excuse for the Observer, that he has
not continued'his remark's upon the perform
ances,- performers, See. âThe' Observer has
attended and been amused, and while he was
amused has generally found cauic of appro
bation ; and the players may be allured tlisjr

ble efforts exerted to rescue them trom any
unjust censure or awkward critic isms, as well
as his hints of fricndfliip to afnftin the cor

the course of-their exhibitions. Some pub-
heat ions in your paper should have been no

as they were aimed or meant to he aimed at
the Observer, or his former publications.
Mrs. Mar/hall, whose particular merits
the Observer promised to discuss, will ex
cuse a further delay, until better health and
more leiTure enable him to do jultice to a

The Spanifli Minister, his amiable bride
and bride maids, occupied a conspicuous
place in the Theatre some evenings ago, and
among the general attraction of notice, the'
Observer paid them a portion of* his atten
tionâA reflexion forced itfelf upon his mind.
that the conduct of those ladies, thus distin
guished, form an important }eiÂ£irt to all, and
efpeciallv to the Fair who attended the Thea
tre. âWere, you aware, my amiable and,
beautiful friends, that your examples were'
actually fafcinating to' your sex? and did
you then reflect that propriety and the:
dignity of virtue called upon you, in a lan
guage persuasive as the eloquence qf a seraph,
to behave with the utmost caution ?
" Go to my lady's chamber" fays Ham
let upon viewing the ikull or Yorick, '' and
tell her if (lie paint an inch thick, yet to this
complexion she mtift come at last ; make
her laugh at that."
Let reflexion call up this idea to your
minds; and that propriety of manners and
even religion itfelf, depend in a great mea-.
sure upon example: and then examine your
own hearts as to some part of your demean
our that evening. A hint is fufficient to the
ingenuous mind,; you po.Tcfs almo/i al! that
good fuife'and virtue requires in woman;
would you be sorry to improve ? The Ob
server is confident you would all be rejoiced,
at the circumftanceof being able to improve;
he knows you to be amiable beautiful tc virtu

The firft applies to mankind generally, the

The Public are cautioned to
bbware of counterfeited Five Dollar Bills of
the Batik of the United States, and Twenty
Dollar Bills of the Bank of North America,
federal of <w/.icb have appeared in circulation
within a few days pajl ; they are a good ge
neral imitation of the genuine Bills, but may
be dijhngiifhed by the following
MARKS.
Five Dollar Bills of the Bank of the
United States.
ALL thai have appeared hav? the letter F.
for their Alphabetical Mark.
The Texture of the Paper is thicker and
whiter and it takes the ink more freely than
the genuine paper.
The O. m the word Company is smaller
than the M. and other letters of that word,
so that a line extended from ihe top of ihe O,
to touch the top of the M would extend con
liderably above the range of the whole word.
waftf
In tin word United the letters are narrow
erand ctofer together than the reft of the bill
The i and fin the word promise are not
parallel, the y inclining much more forward
than the 7.
The engraving is badly executed,die ftiokes
of all the Letters aie stronger and the devi e
in themargin particularly is much coarier and
appears darker than in ihe true bills. Some
at the counterfeits bear date in 1 791â Where
as the Bank was not jii operation till Decern
ber, and 110 five dollar bills were iflued in
lhat year.
Twenty Dollar Bills of the Bank of North
ALL that have appeared have the letter
B. for their alphabetical mark.
They are printed on a paper nearly fimiFar
to that of the counterfeit Five Dollar Notes
above described ; the engraving iijbeitei exe
ucted, and they approach neaier to the ap
pearance of the genuine bills.
The fine ruled lines through the word Tuen
ty y in the body of ihe bill, are in number trhjr
teen in the genuine b lis, and but twelve in
the counterfeits.
The word Company is much like the fame
word in the Five Dollar Bills as defer ibed a
bove, the o being less than Che jo, and others
following.
There is no stroke to the t in the word North
whereas in the genuine bilis the stroke is well
defined.
The letters ent in the word Tutirty, to the
left hand at the bottom, do noi come down to
the line, but are so cut as to give an irregular
appearance to the word, the I w and go
ing below them.
The fignaiuie I Nixon* has the appear
ance of being writteu with lamb-oiack aÂ«d
Oil, and differs from other inks used in
printing the bills and the cafhiei's signature.
It i& supposed these forgeries were committed
in some of the Southern States, aÂ» a 1 the coun
terfeits thai hive appeared, have come Irom
ihence, and two persons have be'en apprehend
ed in Virginia, on suspicion of being the author
of them.
The reward of ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS
will be paid 10 any Peiiou 01 Ptifons who lhail
difcovei and piofecute to conviction the levcial
offenders of the following description* or any
pt them, viz.
The peifon or pcrfons, who manufs&ured

The denomination is of TWENTY DOL
LARS,and the alphabetical mark is-the let
ter B.
They may be diftihguifhed from the genu
ine byi.be following MARKS :
The paper of the counterfeits is of a more
tender texture and glofley fcri'ace than the
genuine, and there is no water mark in them.
Tke letter C. in the word Caftiier, in the
true bills is strongly marked, whereas in the
counterfeits, the whole letter is a fine'hair
stroke, evidently in an unfinilhed Hate. The
letter a in the word demand, is badly formed
and the whole word ill done, and there is no
comma at the end of it, as there is in the
genuine bills.
The marginal device, is much daiker in
the falfe, than in the genuine bills owing to
the (hade flrokes being coarser, much nearer
together, and confequeotly much more nu
merous. This difference strikes the eye at firft
view.
The fame reward of ONE THOUSAND
DOLLARS, will be paid for apprehending, iz
prosecuting to convi&ion the Several above
described Offenders in to this, as to
the last described bills.

AN ESSAY ON THE

Aliquid Temper ad commomm atilitarrm af

The Fuji America* Edition.
THE grand principle of Equality, if right
ly understood, is the onU baiis on vhich
univerfai justice, Jacred oder, and perfect
freedom, can he firmly boilt, and permanent
ly fecur>ed. The view of it exhibited in this
eflay, at the fame time thai it represses the
insolence of* office, the tyranny of prrde y and
the outrages of" oppreiEon ; torfirms, m tbe
most forcible manner, the necessity of fobor
dination, and the just demands of lawful au
thority. So far indeed, from loofenirg the
bands of society, that it maintains inviolate,
every natural and every civil diftin&ion,
draws more closely every facial lie, unites in
one harmonious and juftiv proportioned sys
tem, and brings men together on the even
ground of the inherent rights of human na
ture, of reciprocal obligation, and of a com
mon relation to the community.
