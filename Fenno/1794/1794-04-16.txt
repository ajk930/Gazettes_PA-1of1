NEW-YORK, April n.
C ommunication.
It is remarked by Jasper Wilson, in his
excellent letter to Mr. Pitt,that the great
iuftrument of success of the Jacobins in
France has been the suspicion they con
stantly excited, that every friend of peace
and subordination was conne&ed with the
foreign enemies that are invading France."
In the fame manner "the friends of peace
in Great Britain, were denounced as
leagued with foreign invaders. This was
the reel secret ofMeffrs. Reeves, Burke,&
Co. for levelling the levellers, " Mr. Fox
and the oppofitiof), who attempted to keep
England from engaging in a war against
France, " The nation was panic-struck,
apprehension and credulity go hand in
hand, " and it was thus the English nation
was united against France. '
In America the fame instrument has
been employed with similar success. The
most effe&ual means employed by the late
French Minister to raise an alarm here,
and make this country engage iti a war
with I' ranee, was, a suspicion he very in
duitrioufly excited that the friends of peace
end the federal government were under
British influence.
He openly declared our executive offi
cers to be bribed with British gold. In
this he was indiscreetâthe charge was too
grossâhis best friends would not believe
it, and criedJhame upon him. Such afpe
cific charge required proof for supportâ
this therefore wafs not inlilted onâbut the
general suspicion that federal men were at
tached to Great Britain, Were tones, arif
ocrats and friends to monarchy, required
10 proof; it was only to forcad it among
:ommon people who deal much in name)
imHrttlrttrprxnft j arid render all modc
ate men odious by-unmet which have no
neaning or are not underllood. The bait
â¢vas swallowed by a party ; and certain
:reate prejudice and hatred against the
upportets of our government. To all
such charges the belt answer is, that there
:s not one syllable of truth in these charges
igamfl federal men, and that the British
lave as little influence in the politics of
his country, as the Chinese.

lilhed in Lilbon for the restoration of all
French property, which had been taken pos
session of by the Portuguese, in fix days af
ter the ifliiing of the decree, about the 10th
of February; which is almost a certain au

Thursday, April 10.
Mr. Clark's prjtpojitiqii for flopping the
commercial iuttrcuurfe between the Uni
ted States and Great Britain under con-,
Jideration of the Committee of the -whole
âAir. Sherburne in the chair.
Mr. SEDGWICK's SPEECH,
(concluded.)
He.said he had yefterdav taken the li
berty to suggest to the committee certain
conltuuiioiial cohfiderations. The an
fwere which had been given had by no
Cleans been fatisfactory. It was incum
bent on gentlemen who had so frequently
warned us of the dnnger of uftirping
powerâwho had so frequently, and in
language so animated, charged us to avoid
grasping power by implication, and con
ltruction. It was incumbent on those gen
tlemen, would they preserve consistency
of character, clearly to demonftrate'tlve
authority which they a [Turnedâthat it
might not be supposed that their conduc
tion of the Constitution was a conveni
ent accommodation to the existing cir
cumstances.
It was not now a question whether the
people had made a wife or prudent dilli i
bution of the powers of their govern
ment. They had declared their will, and
that will we were bound by every confide
puion of honor and duty to cxecute. In
the inllrument under which we acted, they
had declared, that the President, under
ccrtain modifications should: be their or
gan to treat exclusively with foreign pow
ers. This authority thus exclusively dele
gated, include all the terms on which a
treaty could be formed. What was the
present meallire ? Prescribing the terms of
treaty, and reftrainiug the constitutional
power from treating on any other terms.
If the Legislature could prescribe those
terms in this instance, it may then pre
scribe all the terms in every instance ; and
of course contioul in all things the exer
cise of that power.
To this reasoning two answers have
been given, the one by a gemlcman from
Pinnfylvania (Mr. Smi-lie\ that the Le
gislature might make such a law, becaule
t+ie eXfCtitivi eolild repeal it. He rcajly
not comprehend the force of the
reasoning; he was gl.id however, he could
with perfect confidence contradidl the af
feru'on, which he was sure would be a ve
ry difgulting one to the people of Ameri
ca.âThere was in fad, in no instance an
authority given to the executive, to repeal
a. ouiftitutional act of the legislature.â
The other answer was that given by a gen
tinman from Virginia, (Mr. Nicholas)
that there could be no objection to the
exercise of this power if it should be assent
ed to by the President and SenateâThis
was still a more extraordinary and unfatis
factory anfwei than the otherâit implied
that the President aitd Senate could make
grants of power to this House, not con
tained in the constitution. Tg this he
would answer, that all the powers which
the House could legally exercise were ex
prefTed in the instrument under which we
actedâthat thoft powers could be neither
enlarged nor abridged by any rpan or body
of men on earth, but in the way pointed
out by the instrument itfelf.
Mr. Sedgwick said these considerations
he had expressed, without any previous
preparation as they occured to his mind.
Should gentlemen who viewed the fubjeft
in the light he did remain silent, he would
in the further progress of thismeafnre, he
pledge 1 himfelf, with more orderly ar
rangement, and he hoped with more per
spicuity, and force, address himfelf to the
consideration of this committee, or of the
Houfe.âlt would avail little to tell him
that his opposition would be unpopular
no man more than himfelf, wished the
good opinion of his countrymen, but no
peifonal inconvenience, no loss of fame or
popular affection, should ever inducc him
to fee his country threatened with evils
incalculable in number, and duration, with
out warning her of her dangerâA country
which he loved, and which he might on
this occasion be permitted to fay, he bad
long served with honest fidelity, and with
out a single instance of fihiller or mere per
sonal regard.

OBSERVATIONS.
The present Is an age;of Paradoxes; as
well as of experiment and revolution
Republicans fay, that their form of civi)
is more propitious, ; thaii all
others, to the preservation of peace on
earth, (how truly is yet to be proved*)
yet republicans are'uiing every means that
fmixiiiitr, stimulated by wrath, can devise,
to plungeTÃetrcouatEy into a war, without
employing previously any prudent means
to avoid it :âwhile others, who arc brand
ed as ariltociats, are as zealous in prefling
the healing expedients of negotiation.
The men, who spent many days to
prove, that we were not strong enough to
risque a few broadsides with the petty pi
rates of Algiers, and, therefore, declar
ed that the arming against them wasufelefs,
can hardly afford a few days for considera
tion, before they would have us rush irtto
a war with Great Britain, the greatest
naval power in the"world ; and before we
have a single veflel ready for the lea, tit
to engage a sloop of war.
Some men complain that the powers of
the executive are dangeroully great ; and
that the public creditors have had their
patriotism debauched by dealing too large
ly in national securities : yet these men
are exerting every nerve, to destroy a state
of peace, in which alone the Executive
(if there be any need of it) may easily
be circumferibed, and the public debt ex
tinguiflied ; and urge us to engage in a
war, whereby the debt wfll not only be
increased, but the powers of the execu
tive, which have excited such alarm, ne
cessarily be enlarged.
Those, who preach that liberty and e
quality are the common rights of all men,
endeavour to confine the most valuable
right of thinking and speaking to thtm
felves, and their alTociates in opinion
and to make it criminal to publish a dif
fering sentiment.
Those, who declare the warmest friend
fhip for the people of France, and wish
them all manner of ptofperity, are inces
santly encouraging the rulers of that peo
ple to proceed, to bury tliemfelves and
their country in one common ruin, rather
than receive a conllitutiofi, which at one
time, lately, had almost umverfal appro
bation ; and thereby put a Hop to the
dreadful havoc, and delolatipn, which are
pursuing them.
Thole, who polfefs a belief in the cbrif
tian Religion, as a necilfary revelation
from Gftdj are. to their utmoH, atkttirg
sceptics and at lit i Its in their attempts to
overturn the altars of that Deity, whom
themselves adore, and in exteiminating
their fellow believers.

tivcs of the people with the army of the
Rhine and the Moselle, dated Strafburgh,
January 3.
"We have been at Spires, citizen col
leagues, as we announced in our last. The
enemy fly with luch rapidity, that it is im
pofiible to overtake them ; but if the men
escaped, their magazines remain. The can
ons of Spires have left upwards of 100,000
pitchers of wine in their cellars, and the
granary was Hocked in adequate proportion.
The bilhop's houses were full of forage, bran
dy and all kinds of eatables. The moll
speedy measures are taken to convey all those
provisions to Landau. The metals which
l'erved to decorate or to compos.- the monu
ments of the cathedral, were also carried off,
the faints dillodged, 6000 wax tapers unpack
ed, feme ciboires and other initruments of
folly melted down, and the bells broke, all
to the greatest glory of the republic.
" The public chests of the city have been
delivered up to the paymaster-general j but
they haye been vilited so often that there
hardly remains any thing in them. The cus
tom-house, full of all kinds of merchandize,
deposited, as it were, in a place of.fafety, by
the French and foreign aristocrats. This
prize, worth one million, ftiall turn to the
profit of the defenders of the country. The
rich inhabitants of the palatinate have emi
grated : we treat them like the worthless
Frenchmen, whose people they have imita
ted. Our troops have advanced as far as
Neuftadt and Frankenthal.
" We do not reckon, in the enumeration
of the prizes, the small magazines of private
persons, which add however to the great
mass. Our chief attention is now turned
to fill the magazines of the republic at the
expence of the enemy.
" The elements agree with us in extermi
nating the traitors ; the Rhine has just fwal
lewed five hundred emigrants who fled from
Weiiicmbourg, to swell the broken army of
Conde.
" The municipal officers and the com
mandant of Lauterburg dared to demand hf
us an amnesty for those inhabitants of that
city who followedtheli.fc.mouÃ Auftriansin
their flight. We nnfv.ered by putting them
under arccft, and their conduit will be ex
amined in Inch a mariner 35 to convince the
traitors and eowlrds that they have nothing
to expert but death from the re lublic.
" P. S. This moment, dear colleagues,
we receive news of the greatfft importance.
The famous poll of Kaisers .Lautern is in
our power. Vive la Kepubliqut \"
" The enemy abandoned, at Leimerfhent,
thirty thousand cwts. of forage ; at Germen
heim, seventy tons of flour, fix thouland
sacks of oats, and fix thousand sacks of dried
vegetables; at Markftall, twelve thousand
sacks of oat 9; at Weiffembourg, fifteen
thousand muikets, a great number of sick
and dying wounded, whom they inhumanly
deprived of the small portion of the provi
sions they had deftributed among them, to
support for a few moments their feeble ex
igence ; at Lauterbourg, all kinds of ammu
nition, a great number of muikets, an im
mense magazine of gun-powder, and thirty
thousand blankets; under the glacis of Fort
Louis,, fixly waggons, with their horses be
fore them. The number of muikets picked
up in all parts, amounts to near thirty thou

Toulon, Dec. 18, 1793.
My Lord,
Agreeably to your Lorcuhip's order, I
proceeded with the swallow Tender, three
English and three Spanish gun boats, to
the Aifenal, and immediately began ma
king the neceflary preparations tor burn
ing the French Ihips and ltores therein.â
We found the Dock Gates wek iecured
by the judicious arrangements of the Go
vernor, altho' the Dock Yard people had
already lubftituted the three coloured coc
kade tor the white one. 1 did not think
it fafe to at.empt the iecuring of them,
confidermg, that contell of any kind,
would occupy our whole attention, and
prevent us trom accomplishing our pur
pose.
The Galley Slaves, to the (lumber of
as leafl "Oco, mewea tncmiclveT^eilous"" ~
fpettators or our operations: Their dii
pofition to oppose us was evident; a..d
being uncliaincd, which was luminal, ren
dered if neceflary to keep a watchful eye
on them on board the galley, by pointing
the guns of the Swallow lender and one
of the Gun Boats on them, in iuch a
manner as to enfUade the quay on which
they mult have landed to come to us, as
suring them, at the fame time, that no
harm ihould happen to them if they re
mained quiet. The enemy kept up a cross
fire of shot and /hells 011 the spot from
Malboul'quet, and the neighbouiing hills,
which contributed to keep the Galley
Slaves in lubjeftion, and operated in every
refpeft, favorably for us,, by keeping the
Republican party in the town within their
houses, while it occasioned little interrup
tion to our work of prepariug and placing
combustible matter in the different flore
houses, and an board the Ihips; such was
the (teadinefs of the few brave seamen I
had under my command. A great mul
titude of the enemy continued to draw
down the hill towards the Dock Yard
wall, and as the night closed in, they came
near enough to pour in an irregular tho'
quick fire of mufquetty on us from the'
Boulangerie, and of cannon from the
heights which overlook it.
We kept them at bay by discharges of
grape /hot from time to time, which pre
vented their coming so near as to discover
the infufficiency of our force to repel a
closer attack. A Gun Boat was itationed
to flank the wall on the outlide, and two
field pieces within agaialt the wicket ulu
ally frequented by the workmen, of whom
we were particularly apprehensive. A
bout eight o'clock I had the fatisfaftion
of feeing Lieut. Gore towing in the Vul
can firefhip. Capt. Hare, her command
er, placed her agreeably to my directions,
in a mod masterly manner, across the Tier
of men of war, and the additional force
of her guns and men diminished my ap
prehensions of the Galley Slaves rising on '
11s, as their manner and occasional tumul
tuous debates ceased entirely 011 her ap- ;
pearaace. The only noise heard among 1
them was the hammer knocking off their ;
fetters, which humanity forbade my op. \
poling, as they might thereby be more at" 1
liberty to save themselves 011 the conflagra- f
tion taking place,among them. In tliis
, fitiiation we continued to wait moll anxi
oiidy for the hour concerted with the Go
vernor for the inflamation of the Trains.
r l'!ie moment the signal was made, we
had the fatisfadlion too fee the flames rife
i(i every quarter. Lieutenaut Tupper
\YÂ»s charged with the burning of the .Ge
neral Magazines, the Pitch, Tar, Tallow'
and Oil Store-houfes,-and fucceeda) most
perfe&ly ; the Hemp Magazine was in
cluded in this blaze: Its being calm was
unfortunate Jo the spreading of the flames,
but 250 barrels of Tar divided among
the Deals and other timber, insured the
rapid ignition of that quarter which L ieo
tenant Tupper had undertaken. >
The M.iit-houfe was equa l/ well set on
fire by Lieut. Middle ton, of the Britannia,
Lieut. Pater, continued in a most daring
manner to brave the flames, in order to
:ompleat the work where the fire feemef 1
I was
to have caught imperfectly
ed to call them off, left his fe. ,iuld
become impracticable: his fituatiou was
the more perilous, as the enemy's fire re
doubled as soon as the amazing blaze of
light rendered us diflindl obje&sof their
aim. Lieutenant Ironmonger, of the
Royals, remained with the Guard at the
Gate till the lad, long after the Spanish
Guard was withdrawn, and was brought
fafcly off by Captain Edge, of the-Alert,
to whom I had confided the important ser
vice of closing our retreat and bringing off
our detached parties, which were laved 10
a n\an. 1 was sorry to find myfelf depriv
ed of the fuither services of Capt. Have :
He had performed that of placing his firr
fhip to admiration, but was blown into
the water, and scorched, by the ex.
plofinn of hei priming, when in the ast cf
putting the match to it. Lieutenant
Gore was affo much burnt, and I was con
iequently deprived of him also, which I re
gretted the rhore, from the recollection.of
his bravery and a&ivity in this warm ser
vice.
The guns of the sir.'ship going off on
both fides as they heated, in the dire&ion
that was given them, towards those Quar
ters from whence we were moil apprehen
sive of the enemy forcing t,heir way in u
oon us, checked their career, Theit
bouts and Republican Songs, which we
:ould hear d flluftiy, continued till they,

Itriiruck by li.e cxplofion of some ti.ouf

imbtr on fire* w s such asnearly to dellroy
he whole of u:. Lietitcnant Pater,, cf
he I'ei ribli, > thhis who'e Boat's/Crew,
learly per'iâ  ed ; the boat was nearly blown
io pieces, but the men were picked up a
live. The Ui iion Gun Boat, which was
leareft to the Iris, fuffered confideiablv,
Mr. Young being killed, with three men,
and the vessel (haken to picces. I hsd
given it in charge to the Spaniih officers
to fire the (hips in the Baton before the
town, but they returned, and reported
that various obllacles had prevented their
entering it. We attempted it together,
as soon as we had compleated the business
in the Arsenal, bu.t were repulsed in our
attempt to cut the boom by repeated Vol
lies of Mufquetry from the Flag ship
and wall of the Battere'y Royale. The
cannon of this battery had been spiked by
thejudicious precaution takeuby the Go
vernor, previously to the evacuation of the
Town.
The failure of our attempt on the /hips
in the Bason before the town, owing to
the infuffiviency of our forces, made me
regret that the Spauifli gun boats had been
withdrawn from me to perform other fer-
vice. The-Adjutant Don Pedro Cotiel
la, Don Francisco Riguelme, and Dun
Francisco Trufello remained with me to
the last, and I feel bound to bear teftitr.o
ny of the zeal and activity witk which
they performed the molt eflential services
during the whole of the business, as far
as the infufficiency of their force allowed
being .reduced by the retreat of the
gfun boats, to a single Felucca, and a
mortar-boit which had expended its am
munition, but contained 30 men with cut
laflts.
We now proceeded to burn the Hero
and Thcmiftocle two Seventy four gun
(hips, laying in the inner road. Our ap
proach to them had hitheito been imprac
ticable in bo3ts as the French prisoners
who had been left in the bitter fliip were
still i.n poffeflioÃ of her, and had shewn adetermination to reiift oar attempt to
come on board. The scene of conflagra
tion around them, heightened by the late
trem'-udous explosion, had however a
v/akened their fears for their lives. Think
ing this to be the cafe, I addre'fed
cxpreffing my readiness to land tnem in a
place ofÂ°fafety, if they would submit ;
and they thankfully accepted the otter,
{hewing themselveS to be completely inti
midated, and very grateful for our humane
intentions towards them, in rtof attempt
ing to burn them with the llv.p. It was
necefTary to proceed with precaution, as
thsv were more numerous than onrfelves.
We at lenp-th completed their disem
barkation, and then set her on fire. On
this occasion I had nearly loft myvaluable
friend asd affitlant, Lieutenant Miller of
the Windsor Castle, who had staid so long
on board to insure the fire taking, that it
gained on him suddenly, and it was not
without being very much fcorrhed, and
the rifle of being fuffbeated, that we could
approach the '.hip to take him in. Ihe
loft to the service would have been very
"-.-eat, had we not fncceeded in our en
deavours to 'save him. Mr. Knight,
Midlhipman of tlie Windsor v_aflle, who
was ir, the boat with me, Chewed much
adlivity and address on this occalion, as
well as firmnefe throughout the day.
The explofioii of a fecoiid powder vef
fei, equally unexpected, and with a (hock
everi greater than the firit, again put us
in the mod imminent dangei of perilhing;
andwhcn.it is considered that we were
within thefphere of the falling timber,it is
next to miraculous that no one piece, of
the nÂ»>iy which made the water' foam
r iund us, happened to touch either the
Swallow or the three boats with me.
Having now set fire to every thing
within our reach, exhausted our combulti
ble preparations and our strength to such
a degree that the men absolutely chopped
on the oari, we directed our course to
join the fleet, running the gauntlet under
a few ill-directed fflot from the forts of
Balaguier and Aigiiillctte, now occupied
by the enemy ; but foitunately without
loss of'any kind, we proceeded to the
place appointed for the embarkation of -
the troops, and took off as many as we
could carry. It would be injustice to those
whom [ have omitted to name,' for their J
lirft having been fj immediately under my
eye, if 1 did not acknowledge myfelf in
debted to them all for their extraordinary
exertions in the execution of this great
national objedt. The quickness with
wnich the inflamation" took effect, on my
fignnl, its extent and duration, are the
belt evidences that every officer and mau
was ready at his poll, and fin'n under most
perilous citcumltancesâl therefore sub
join a lilt of the whole who were employ
ed on this service.
We can alcertain that the fire extended
to at least ten fail of the line, how much
further we-carinot fay. The loss of the
general magazine, and of the quantity of
pitch, tar, rolin, hemp, timber, cordage
and gunpowder, muftconfiderably impede
the equipment of the few ships that re
main. lam sorry to have been obliged to
leave any, bnt I hope your Lord/hip will
be fatislied that we did as much as our cir
cumscribed means enabled us to do, in a
limited time, pressed as we were by a force
f<> much superior to us.

No fubjcft can pofiibly furnift more just
matter for ridicule, than the A', ftrian re
presentation of affairs on the Rhine. By
their account, out of 40,000 who attack
ed the Puke of Brunfwick, near Landau,
ou the 25th of November, 15,000 of the
French were cut to piecesâon the id De
cember, 10,00 a were surrounded in a
wood, and fWed the fame fateâon the
19th and 20th of the fame month, 12,000
expiated, to hfe their own phrase, their
unexampled atrocitiesâYet, strange to
tell, armies, ft ill moie numerous, rife
from their ashes, which continue similar
opera tions with fimibir success.
The most terrible scene perhaps tha
:ver was presented to human eyes, mi>{
lave hern the embarkation at Toulon, a
midst volumes of fire, the {hrieks of wo
men, the violence of the profligate, and
the confn!; >n of allâHow many fouls
have pe*ifiled it is impoflible for conjecture
to estimate. How many ili 11 more unfor
tunate are abandoned to the French, we
fhail soon ascertain from the records of
'their fatal tribunal.
LONDON, Jr-aary 9
There will be three dating pai ties the ap
proaching kill on in jfttfiament. The Stirk
ltes or Alarariites, who will perlifi in puriu
ing the war on the Continent, lor the pur
pose of extirpating the Sans Culottes and
Carmignols; the Pittites, who will recom
mend the withdrawing our troops from, the
Frontiers,and aflift in an expedition against
the East and Weft Indies ; and the oppositi
on, who will recommend peace, as the bell
security to the happiness and well being of
the nation.
The republicans at Toulon,even in the
exultation of victory,have condescended to
ekeout the jlion'sjkin with the fox's tail.
They -have kept the Britifli and Spanifli
flags flying op the town and forts, as a
decoy to such veflels as may arrive with
men, stores or proviiions, intended for the
allies. The flratagem, if we may believe
their own accounts, has been but too fuc
cefsful.
PHILADELPHIA,

This forenoon the Pi-efident of the United

John Jay, Envoy extraordinary to
the Court of Great Britain.
At an early hour this morning, the Gal

after some opposition was carried in the af

fidential communication from the President
-of the United States received yesterday.

Copy of a letter from Capt. John Cochran.
Kingjion, March 4, 1794.
Mr. Stephen Girarcl,
" I am lorry to inform you, that having
failed from Aux Cayeson the 25 th of Febru
ary, with the nett proceeds of both cargoes,
in t'ugar,, cpffee,' bar iron, &c. amounting in
value tÂ« ,Â£.5645,16,5.1 was taken that day
by the lchr. Hawke, and frigate Success,
Capt. Roberts, and lent down to this port.
1 W33 fcrft boarded by the Hawke, which ves
sel belongs to Mr. Kingston, here. They
Cook pofieilion of my vellel withqut even the
formality of looking over my papers, and
mull have been convinced that tliere was no
property on board belonging to citizens of
France. Upon my arrival I underwent an
examination, and swore to my velfel and car
_n'. wl'li i);,â  -nit" mrs, nn.i 1 piuple.-â
But notwithstanding this, I apprehend the
brig and cargo will be libelled, and at it will
then be out of our power to take any Heps
for liberating the vessel, I fear the whole will
be condemned.
" A brig belonging to Mr. Pennock, of
Norfolk, and bound to this port, was bro't
in as' a prize the day I arrived ; the captain
informs me that his orders from the owner
were, in cafe of being topped here, to pro
tect against the proceedings, and return home
without attempting to lay claim,which would
occalion a fruitlefs expence."
The f J,'owing interefling detail is filrnijtei
by a gentle/nan who came pajfenger in the
Jhp Sampson, from Carton.
IN palling the Straits 6f Banco, we were
informed a large fleet of Malay prows, 150
fail, had been lying for foine time at the is
land of Lucepara, at the entrance of the
Straits ; but had a few days previous tooui
arrival there gone to the eastward in search
of another fleet of those pirates of similar
strength, with whom they were at war. Great
danger is to be apprehended from those peo
ple, uniefs the vellel has the appearance of
being well armed. An American (hip, cal
led the Fair American, commanded by Capt.
Lee, palfed through the Straits of Banco
previous to the Sampson, and was chafed by
them, but got oft' under cover of the night.
The Prows are all provided with arms, mod
of them having- a four pounder in the bow,
and small arms in abundance, they had taken
a Dutch guarde de coafti, having previously
purchased from them all their ammunition
and small arms.
The Ladrones of Cochin-China had been
in great numbers on the coaltof China, and
taken a Portuguese lhip by surprise, having
boarded h*r in the nightâthey also captured
a number of Junks and small boats belong
ing to the Chinese.
Lord Macartney, the Britilh Ambassador
to the Emperor of China, was expected at
Canton in a few days after the failing of the
Sampson, being then on hts return by land
| Iroin Pekin. His embafly, it was reported and
I .lelicved, had not fuece;ded in the very im
} portairt objects wished for by the Britilh Go
vernment, the chief of which was the privi
lege of their veflels to trade at some port
more northerly than Canton, to the exclusi
on of all other nations ; tfiey were also in
hopes of getting many very oppressive im
positions abolished, such as the Cumfhaw or
i resent to the Hoppoos, See. The-e it was
believed they would in part succeed, which
would be of advantage to all nations trading
to Canton. Ihe Britilh company benefited
m a small degree, it was fuppoied, by the
embafiy on their leaving Macaoâ(which i
place they retire to when the season for bufi
ness is pitted lid return to Canton on tie ar
rival of tliL-ir Ihips the er.fuing feafoÃ.)
1 hey made an offer of the cullomary
cum.'haw to the Mandarins, provided they
Would give receipts for the fame, intimating
at the fame time, that it would be forwarded
on to lerd Macartney, who was then on his
way to Pekin, which t ie Mandarins refu
fed and permitted them to pass without pay
ing. 1
It was reported also, that the presents taken
by Lord Macartney for the emperor were
refufed.* On his arrival in the yellow sea,
he was received with great splendor by Man
darins sent for that purpose by the? Empe
ror, and conducted to Pekin ; fo'me difficulty
occurred there by reason of his lordships re
fufing to comply with the usual salutation
before the Emperor, which' is to bow the
head to the ground. But on his being in
formed no audience would be granted him
imlefs this previous ceremony was complied
with,he Submitted. At the departure of the
Sampson his lordfiiip was on his way from
Pekin over land to Canton. Great prepara
tions were made at the places he ftoped at on
his journey, he was treated with great po
liteneCs and every mark of refpeil Ihewn him:
The Lyon man of war of 60 guns, Erasmus
Gore, commander, and the IndoftaYi Tndia
rnan, Capt. Mc'lntolh, had arrived previous
to the failing of the Sampson, after landing
Lord Macartney and his suite. The Lyon
was laying at the entrance of the Bocca Ti
ger with a French brig from the north weft
coast of America with .tins, which they had
fnade a prize of.
The Britilh Indiaman Princess Royal had
been captured in the Straits of Sunda by
three French privateers, after a warm action,
which continued tor an hour with great bra
very on both fides. A number of French
privateers were in the Straits of Malacca,
and had almost entirely doftroyed the ilntch
and English coasting trade in that quarter,
having taken i*ear sixty fail of veflels large
and small, and it was supposed few home
ward bound ships from Canton to Bengal
and Bombay would escape.
* Another ccconnt fays they were accepted.

A meflage was received from the Presi
dent, communicating a letter from the
Bvitifli minister here, in which the inftrnc
tions of the Bth of June are endeavored to
be shewn consonant to the law of nations ;
also sundry communications from the south
wrftrm territory, ami a letter from our
ambsflador at Madrid, communicated con
fidentially.
The non-importation resolution was tak
en up in the House: Mr. Smith (S. C.)
presented a modification of the original
motion, which was declared to be a sub
stitute, by the chair, and therefore out of
order.
>rder.
Mr. Giles moved to strike out of the
â¢efolution the Jine qua non condition, of
eftitution for negroes carried off.
Mr. Smith (S. C.) obje&ed to the
notion.âHe feared it would appear like
in abandonment of the claim.
After some further debate on this a
mendment, Mr. Filzfimons suggested a
iubftitute for the resolution to avoid the
jmbarrafTment of a fpecification.
Mr. Giles withdrew his amendment.
Mr. Smith (S.C.) moved to ltrike out
the fpecification and insert a clause more
general.
After further conversation, Mr. Tracy
exprelfed a wish for the previous question,
under the imprefilon, that this is not a pro
per time for a final decision on the busi
ness.
Mr. Smith (S. C.) consented to with
draw his amendment until the previous
question be put.
After some debate the yeas and nays

The following memorial from Samue
Hopkins, was read in the House of Re*
prefentatives of tills Commonwealth,
the 19th inli.
To the Speaker and Members of the At
lembly of Pc. fylvania :
THE Subscriber apprehends he has at
great labour and expence much improved
on the common mode of manufacturing
pot and pearl alhea, for which improve
ment the United States have granted him,
an exclusive right for a term of year 9.
The advantages over the furmer is set forth
by diveis*Certificates, one of which signed
by David Rittenhoufe, Doftot Rulh and
others, hath been publiflnd- By variety
of improvements in the application of the
principle, he apprehends he lias so far fim
plffy'd it, that at small expenee it may be
conduced by women or chddren, altho'
larger the works greater the profits result
ing in proportion. In a work that maycoft
about 12 dollars to be worked by a boy of
12 or 13 years old, with attention, may
make 150 weight of pearl ashes, an j with
good house ashes at 9d per bufhtl, wood at
20s per cord ; the pearl ashes so made when
fold at the common price of 50 s P er hund
red,leaves about 40s for his week's labour.
The process is allowed to be easy and fami
liar, one of those small works is now Hand
ing at his house in Arch Street No. 43, and
is free for infpeftion to any thqt inclines
to visit it; he therefore wishes a suitable
Committee may be appointed, one 01" more
members of each County to examine the
fame, fee tome experiments performed,
and should it be thought after every neeef
fary examination, this improvement prefer
able to the former, and a general benefit
to this State, in bringing forward this ma
tt ufa&ury in which little heretofore hawe
been done, he willing to relinquish his afor
faid right,as saras relates to Pennsylvania,
for such a compensation as the merits of it
may appear reasonable todcfire.
SAMUEL HOPKINS.
2d Mo. 19, 1764.
A work that may cost about 300 dollars
when compleat with 4 large boilers worked
by 2 fires, 2 hands may make as much
pearl ashes as common black salts, perhaps
18 or 20 cwt. per week, it may require
about 7 cord of wood. The quantity
made in a certain given time, will always
depend oaths attention of the woikmeiu _
the fiee of the furnace, the quality of the
ashes, &c. &c.
The Committee appointed Feb. 25,laft,
on the memorial of Samuel Hopkins,
made report, which was lead as follows,
viz :
The Committee to whom was refered
the application of Samuel Hopkins to the
Legislature, on lhe,fubjeÂ£t of an improve
ment discovered by him in the manufac
tury of pot and bearl ashes, beg leave to
to reportâThat they think favourably of
the prayer of the said applicant, and aie
of opinion that it will beadvantageous'for
the State to have the mode invented by
him, rendered of general utility, by the
purchase of his exclusive privilidge in the
discovery, which they understand may be
effetted on very moderate terms; they
therefore recommend the following resolu
tion :
Rtfolved, That a Committee be ap
pointed to bring in a bill to grant the furo
of Â£ to Samuel Hopkins, in re
ward of his discovery, and as a compensa
tion for the surrender of his exclusive right
to said improvement, within the limits of
this commonwealth.

derick County, called Hammond*? Strife ; â
that being so seised, Basil executed a power

land, that afterwards the said Benjamin fold
the laid land to a certain William Gaither for
the consideration of fix hundred pound* which
