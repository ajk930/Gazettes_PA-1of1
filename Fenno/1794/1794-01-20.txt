In committee of the whole, on the report of
the Secretary of State, relative to the com*
mtrcial intcrcourfe of th'u country, vj'tlh fw
reign nations.
Sketch of Mr. MadifonV obfervationi in
reply to Mr. Smith.
( Conclude J.)
Here Mr. Madison entered into a more
particular detail of the items of the pro
duce of the United States, exported into
the Trench and Britiih dominions, and of
tKe impoftt demanded by these nations re'f
pe&ively. As, to Britain, there is'a Hand
ing prohibition against the importation of
wheat and flour into that country, until
they rife to such a high price, that Britain
cannot supply herfelf any where else than
in the United States. In France, the
only duty impofed,was one eighth per cent
and that cannot be called a tax, but is on
ly meant as a custom-house regulation, to
ascertain the quantity imported. In the
French Weft Indies, wheat and flour pass
by a general law, duty free, that is, on
payment of the said one eighth percent.
Rice is admitted on the fain: terms of one
eighth per cent, into France, whilst in
Britain, it pays 7 (hillings and four pence
sterling, per cwt. and in the French Weft
Indies, only .one per cent. In tile Bri
ti(h Weft Indies, it is free. Salted fiih
is prohibited is the Britilh Weft Indies.
Indian corn pays one per cent, in the
French islands, and is free in the BritffK.
The only article that he had ever heard df
exported from the Weft Indies to this
country, which could be said to be â¢
tageous to the manufactures of thcUni' -
.ed States, was molafles, which we g\ t
from the French islands; andthis isalihoft
the only instance, where we have raw ma
terials from any country. He iSbferved,
that Ffance would feel the want of our
commerce, mvich less fertfibly thai) Britain
would feel it, as her internal refourcei
were infinitely greater.- â ' The difpofitioils
I of the two countries towards us, .were ex
tremely differentâBritain had behaved
very coldly, and-France vify warmly.
After taking a comprehensive ranges
thro' all the various articlesof the produce
of the United States, such as felted beef
and pork, indigo, tobacco, See. he (hew
ed always the illiberal reftrifVions laid on
our trade by the Britilh policy,v.hen com
pared to the benefits allowed to us by
France, whereour (hipping may be natu
ralised. and many othe* advantages grant
ed, that are forbid by Britain ; to follow
Mr. Madison thro'the whole of his details
would be far beyond the limits of our plan
as well as that we feel much diffidence
in recording this important fpecch. We
mult therefore pass over some of the de
tails, in order to observe, than when he
came to make mention of the advantages
derived by Britain, from the fur trade, in
which the United States were in
tended to participate,but from which they
were a&ually reftrifled, by the detention

introducefomepoliticalobfervations, which
he was sorry he could not on the prcfent
occasion, refrain from doing.
He apo'ogized for introducing politics
iato thiÂ» (jucftion, a proceed'ng which had
been so severely deprecated, by the gen
tleman who spoke yesterday. He felt it
however, impofiible to keep them altoge
ther out of view, in considering thÂ£ ques

" I do not wi(h,faid he, to enter into
any irritating views. I could be content
to forget, with the member who spoke yes
terday, that the treaty of peace is not yet
executed. I pass over the Western Fofts;
the Algerines, the Indians, the violation
of neutral bottoms, the feiznre of our

< M Mr. Madison never could dilfcoVer upoii
what grounds Vvc could be' ftiggofed to '
dread the coiifequence of theprcfjxjfition*.
At the utmoft.thty went only taeettaKiffr
reciprocity, and in fa&, did not even {so
that length. If we are a free people, we â¢
have a right flowing from bur indepen
dence, to make what regulations we think
proper. If it was the design oF~ttther
powerij to drive us . iiito a quatrd, we
could'net help it, and we mult abide the
itfue, but if that was the intention of any
of the powers of Europe, they could fopn -
find a much better pretence, than any a
riling from the jpropofitions.
Hfc next noticed an old argument, that
had so frequently been advanced in regard
to the unequal operation oftorita'age laws
on the diffci*nt ftatts, but' there was no
Hate *hat would make a greater facrificr >
than Virginia, from which he had the ho
nor to be a representative. The'fouthera
states, as to domestic- mariufa&ores', were â 
hardly inferior to the northern, and Were,
rapidly advancing to an'equality. The
materials of fhip-buiiding were ipwdifced
more abundantly in the states foiith of
Pennlylvania, and they exported the most
Valnuble commodities. They had cpnfe-i
quently a greater risque on the element of
the tea, and therefore stood in heed of bc
ing prote&ed by maritime regulations.
The proportion of (hips built in Amsrica
to those in Britain 'previous to the reyolu-'
on, was as twenty thre to forsy. -Thred
fifths of these wire built ir. the eaftcro
states, snd two-fifths in the southern dates.
Here he quoted the opinions Contained
in Â» report of one of the officers of th?
executive of the "United States, which
mentions-, that Britain during the last hurt
. dred yeafs, hid fperit forty two of them
in war, *iid fifty eight in> peace ; the con
feqiienci of which' has been extremely in
jurious to-the mercantile ic.tereft of Ame
rica. Mr. 'Madison entered into fumefur
ther details, through which we found it,
difficult to foEoW him;.trf]>ectingÂ±hcÂ«nor
rhous advance of freight tipon American <
cargoes transported in Britifn bottoms,
duririg a British WSr.c.. The Jpfrjin: these
cases fell on America, jmd'froro whence he
inferred the propriety and of

; our own.
When we confide* v -the imm'nfefldjmn
tage:i that mud lefult. from-t!te.reguliitiojts
propbfed by the-- refolutiuiij bsfor?". the
committee, there .cau fee.jio doubt* .but
that they will amply repay.us (<y
pence of fitting out a marine- force, and for
any other confequencesthat might attend ,
it. With regard to. the. effect that>:jnight
be expected in Europe'from these propo
sitions. he- believeA.thu they would pro
duce a' (hort inconvenience and a foiling
benefit. Perhaps they would have ail eÂ£
feÂ£t to change the policy of some foreign
nations. In 1783 and 1784, it.was de
bated in the BritWh Cabinet what line of
conduit ojight to be pur.ued with regard
to America. After confidence diftulSon
it was determined,, that the government of
America was so feeble, and tha interests
of the refpe&ive ftatu so discordant, that
Britain might ast towards us as ilie thought
proper. . ....
â¢ 111 will and jealousy hive always been
the predominant featui es of Englan l'Â» be
haviour towards Ame.ica, (he had been
farther encouraged by the dream of being
able to farm (li provisions for her Weft-
India islands from the remnant of hen pof
feffionaon tbe cor.t'nent of America. Ex
perience had long fin?e put an end tojuch
expectations. The only other grounds for
treating us with difrefpeft were founded
on the impotency of our governors and the
want of union among ourselves.
The decision of the lioufe on the refp
lutiom now pending would determine
whether these tvvo causes lUB exilted. A
determination against them, jpuld give
in Europe a very bad of Our
national char/i&er, had they reafbn to be
lieve that our government was feeble, or
that the interest of the different
could, npt be reconciled. He would' not
at prefeni farther intrude on the patience
qf the committee and thereforeiconcludtd
by o'.iferring, that to reject theyrapafr

In the Attica, .we learn, that since the re

taken place.
That on the 4th of November the

That on the 14th of November the Bri

had lately arrived at Oftend, embarked

That the British army under the Duke

were to keep the field during the winter.
We further lcarn,from Mr.'Dixon,thathe
was in London on the sth'of November,
that in London, by the latest accounts
they had had ifrom Lord Hood, they were
informed that Toulon was besieged by a

which defended it was fup'pofed to be a*

The wonderful Â» crity with winch fa
bricated news are circulated in order 10
niifinform the public of the real stare of.
things in Europe, is no lmall evidence ot
the designs of their authors. But the oj
ueiis of the United States cannot cÂ«t;iia~
ly be disposed to .thankthofe who Src per
petually* deceiving^them. When great .e
---vents take pkee, t'uey will be known here
by the usual and frequer.t channels of com
munications ; the anticipation of events
frequently lead to difappointmcnts, and
does more injury than good to that
on the fide of which they are anticipetcc.
They can answer so other purpose than
to give a temporary aid; when they are
afterwards found to be falfe and fabri
cated with improper views, they produce
a permanent evil.
The great news of last Taefday, which
the public were amused with, and- which
Mr. Genet tells us prevented the Congrefj
from Jlaying in their fitting, turn out to be
without foundation, notwithstanding the
Extraordinary Gazette of SurnLiy, which
indeed defeats itfelf.
If the intelligence was calculated to
have any influence on certain ir.cafurcs de
pending, the folly of fucb a projtft is ob
vious, for the speedy contradiction must
convince the reflecting, how dangerous it
is to fuffer the {hifting and varying hazards
of war in Europe ty weigh in tlae decision
of great national aÂ£ts.
An independent nation (hould pursue
it's own policy, and no? fuller the mÂ«a.
fures on which it's prosperity depends to
Jkake in tie fro.every breath of ru
mour. Miserably dependent indeed Ihould
, we be on European-polities, il the gain of
the loss of a battle' is ta be the ftandatd of
merit ai>d the rule of dCe'ijtm in great. quc/r
tions of government.-' . .
The events of war are fluctuating: in ; a
war, like that in Europe a great victory
on one day is counterbalanced by a, great
defeat on anotherâthe capture of a town
in one quarter is an offset againll.that of
another in another quarter, and it may be
years before the ultimate tjcfjjtcn of ths
contest will be seen. ~
In the mean time, what ever private sen
timents. may prompt,pvbTic mcafures fhouid
Readily follow lip the true national interejft,
of the United States without a deviation,
occasioned by this yi&ory, or that de
feat. Thus, .while the great powers ,of
the world, are weakening themCelves by
war, this happy country will be ftrengt!.-
ening itfelf by peace.âXJnlefs this guard
ed and steady policy be pursued, we (hall,

and put ourselves back where wc were in.

of the subscribers to call or fend for their vo

poiuble,
The tbwth roivMx of the Encyclopedia is
now presented to tiie public ; but as it makes
it* appearance in an imperfect state, some ac
count of the reafort of that impetfe&ion ftiould
be given. On the Bth of September last, the
Piibliflier had the misfortune of having his
Printing-office butnt down by a fire which
broke out in the neighbourhood, and a great
quantity of his printing materials destroyed,
and among other articles, the fiouees, with
which he was printing the tables or lo
oaÃitkms, belonging to the present volume,
were melted down by the violence of the fire.
As afupply of these could not be immediatefy
obtained, he was under the neceflity of pub
lifting the volume without these tables; but
hopts he? (hall be able to pubiifli tbÂ«m with the
ne*t volume which is now in considerable for
wardnfefs.
The Publi flier embraces this opportunity Of
exprefllng his grateful acknowledgments fa
the generous public, for the very liberal pa
tronage with which his undertaking has been
honored; at the fame time he takes the li
berty of representing to fucb of the subscribers
as are in arrears, the indifpenfiMe neceflity of
punctuality, both in taking up (he volumes as
early as pofGble after publication, and of pay
in; for them when taken. Many of the sub
scribers having got only one, two, three, fee.
volumes, aud several volumes remain unpaid.
Thus the work hangs in all its different ft ages
from the 'commencement; and though lift im
portance of a fe\Â¥ dollars may be but a trifle
to the individuals, yet the accumulation of
these trifles V*fp*lD lays the Publiflier under
very serious embarraffinent, and deprives him
of the use of many Thousands of Dollars which
at this time would be of very efienttnl service.
For these reasons the Publisher finds himfelf
under the neceflity ofrecurfing to the original
terms of publication, and in future no vo
lumes will be delivered but only to thole who
take and pay-to the time of publication,
