In committee of thr irbole ok Mr. WiJifon**

cfiitcb of iur. Maui Jon.
fcOST!NUtDÂ»j
Retaining the train of his obfcrvation*,
he; n.LCvxltd to explain the remedial ope
ravor of h:s proportions.
lirji. They will make the British na
tion frnfiblc that wv can, by just and pa
cific means, inflict cOr.fequences which
wih make it her interest, to pay a jult re
gard to our rights and interests.
To enforce this tendency, he enlarged
on the ideas "he had formerly exprefled in
relation to die dependance of Great Bri
tain on the eemmefee of the United States,
and the obvious and eflential dependance
of the British Weft-Indies, on the supplies
of the United States.
On the hitter fubjeft, he entered into a
particular reply to the member from Maf
ldchufett* (Mr. Ames) who had argued
that the lirttifh regulation of the trade
bfctween the United States and the Weft
iYidies, whs conformable to the principles
of the colony system as eftablilhed by the
commercial nations of Europe, and could
not therefore be reafonablr complained of.
2d. That the Weil-Indies could obtain
fiipr,lies irom other quarters, ar.d did not
tin efore depend on the United States ' r
nay, that there was danger, by forcing
tliele fupphYs into other channels, of our
lo:' â¢ !ie blanch of trade altogether.
sd. That tli< tiade would hardly em
ploy more than a dozen brigs, and was
the efore not worth contending for.
In anlwer to the firft argument of Mr.
Ames, Mr. Madiion undertook to (hew,
that Great Britain had not pursued, but
violated the principle of the colony system.
The truefpirit ofthis system, he laid, was
to confine the trade between the parent
country and the colony, to their own ves
sels, and to allow as little trade as poflible,
between Â»â¢>* colony and foreign countries ;
but When a trade with a foreign country
became necessary to the colony, to allow
tit foreign vef/eis the fame carrying privileges
ai -?i dto their own. Colonies, he said,
were to be considered as parts of a com
mori empire. The trade between one part
ami another, as between London and
Kinglton hi Jamaica. wan to be consider
ed, equally an internal trade with the
co.g trade between London and Li
verpool, or the trade between the difTer
ejit po.t:- ol the United Stales; and might,
if d.e"tied expedient, be equally restrained
to domcttic bottoms. But when a trade
was opened between a colony and a foreign
country, the cafe was changed: the fo
reign country became a party, and had a
reciprocal claim to the use of its bottoms,
as much in the trade with the colony, as
with any other part of the empire, to which
the colony belonged. In support of this
doctrine, Mr. M. referred to the example
of every nation in Europe, except that of
Great Britoifl, which had American colo
nies. Denmajk, Sweden, the United Ne
therlands, France, Spain and Portugal,
had thei: colonies, a well as Great Bri
tain : and some of them, rigorously at
tached to the principles of the colony sys
tem : yet uot a finglc one of these"nations
had refuted, whenever a trade waspermit
t. at all between the colonies and another
country, to make the carriage common to
the veflels of both the parties. Great Bri
tain alone had attempted i monopoly in
such cases for her own vefftls. Her ex
ample therefore was an innovation on the
colony system, as well as an infraction of
the rights of reciprocity.
In answer to the 2d position of Mr. A.
he denied that permanent {applies of pro
visions and lumWii could be derived from
any. other pait of the world than the Unit
ed States: not from the northern parts of
Europe, which either did not produce, or
were too remote to tend them : not from
the southern parti of Europe, which de
pended themlelves on the northern parts
and on America: not from Great Britain,
which imported bread, for her own use,
amounting one year with another accord
ing to the repoit of the committee of the
privy council, to the sum of near three
hundred thousand pounds sterling, and
wa% certainly not an exporter of lumber :
not fmm Ireland, which could not pretend
to rival the United Stales in anv article
but that of fait provisions ; and this was so
much dearer, that a prohibition alone of
ours, could ga*n a market for hfrs. The
gentleman had relied on the csnpacity of
Ireland to extend her cultivation of wheat,
so as to spare supplies of this article also.
Such a revolution in her interior state was
not very probable. But he ouvht at lealt
tohave renumbered, that as the palture
lands of Ireland should be turned into
wheat lidds, her export of beef would de
crease, in proportion as Ihe might be ena
bled to export bread.
It was a wafle of time, Mr. M. said,
to disprove by minute enquiries, the pos
sibility of supplying the British Welt In
dies from the old continent, on terms
that would not be worse than abandoning
them altogether. The truth was that
the gentleman (Mr. A.) had in this par
ticular, gone beyond the mod sanguine
advocates of the Britilh policy, Mr. Knox
and Lord Sheffield themfclves ; who li
mited their ultimate hopes of supporting
the Weft-Indies without the aid of the
United States, to the remaining pofTef
iions of Great Britrin on this continent.
He would proceed, he said, to (hew what
foundation there was for the opinion of
these gentlemen, and the gentleman from
MalTachufetts, in favor of this resource.
And he was able to givt the molt full and
decisive evidence in the cafe, by recurring
to 1 an authentic document ot our own,
from which it appeared, that the conti
nental colonies of Great Britain, instead
of being able to fumifh the Weft India
colonies, were themselves dependent for
the very articles wanted there, on the sup
plies of the United States.
In the official statement of our exports
for the year as late as 179 1, moll of the
articles lent to the Britift continental co
lonies, were of a fort and ail amount so
directly to the point, that he hoped the
committee would excuse him-for repeat
ing them in detail. He stated them as
follows:
Bread-Stuffs and Rools.
Wheat, 3,125 bushels
Rye, 2,201
Barley, 32
Indian corn, 80,734
Oats, 314
Buckweat, 26

Laths,
Blocks,
Oar-rafters,
Trunnela
Oak Planks and 1
Boards, J
Pine, do. 17,0000
Maple and beach, do. 7,5000
The total of the exports, including a
few articles under other heads, amounted
to two hundred, seventy thousand, two
hundred fifty and nine dollar*.
Here then, it is seen, that not only in
the bread fluffs, and meats of every fort,
but in the articles of lumber and live
flock, for which, by unvierfal acknow
ledgment, the Weft Indies mud depend
either on the United States, or the Brit
ish Continental colonies j the latter are so
far from being a rival to us, or a resource
to the Weft Indies, that they continue,
at this day, to supply their own deficien
cies fiom our market.
Mr. M. said, that he should not have
employed so much of the time of the com
mittee on this haul, if the gentleman,
(Mr. Ames) had not attempted to revrve
the arguments with refpeit to Canada and
Nova Sfcotia, which had milled Great
Britain in her political calculations and
ptefent views.
He had heard the language of the gen
tleman on this fubjeft, with allonidiment.
That Mr. Knox and Lord Sheffield, Bri
tilh lubjefts, viewing the profpedt with
British eyes, at the dillance of three thou
sand miles, in the year 1783, when little
enquiry and no experiment could assist
them, Ihould have run into the error, was
perhaps not so marvellous. But, that an
enlightened citizen of America, feeing
with American eyes, living in the neigh
borhood as it were of the scene, in a (late
whose wharves afford proofs of the daily
dependance of the British Continental co
lonies for the neceflaries of life, on the
market of the United States, fliould, in
the year 1794. adopt the opinion that
thofc colonies could supply the I Hands,
after a trial of nine years had probably
forced the authors of the opinion, Knox
and Sheffield themselves, to abandon it,
could not be heard without some surprize ;
and mud be considered at lead as the ful
led proof, that the gentleman had not
given fufficient attention to the present
fubjecJt, to claim that weight which was
in general due to his observations.
Mr. M. said he was not less surprised
at the 3d position of the gentleman from
MaflachufetU, viz. that the Weft-India
trade could be carried on by a dozen
brigs; and consequently, was not an ob
jcÂ£i worth our pursuit. The plain answer
to this argument was, to state the fact,
that the (hipping entered in one year from
the British Weft-Indies, was not a dozen
brigs, but 107,759 tHns -
Besides the immediate importance of
this auxilliary resource for our navigation,
he remarked, that there were two confi
deratioin which enhanced the value of the
object : one, that as the Weft-India arti
cles could be brought cheaper in Ameri
can ve' r e!s, they would come cheaper to
American consumers ; the other, that as
our supplies would at the fame time be
carried cheaper to the Weft-Indies, the
people there could afford to consume the
more of them.

It had been urged that the proposed
reftriÂ£tions on the trade with Great-Bri
tain would produce clamors here as well
as there, and that Congress might be
obliged to recede, before the Britiih go
vernment would be under the neceflity of
doing so. To this Mr. M. replied, that
he was under no such apprehension. He
thought more favorably of the good sense
as well as virtue of his fellow-citizens. On
the fide of Great-Britain it had been (hewn
there would be the greatest distress, and
the least ability to bear it. The people
there were not accustomed, like the peo
ple of the United States, to felf-denying
regulations. They would not have the
fame confidence in the justice of their caufr.
And it was particularly worthy of remark,
that the people of Great-Britain would be
difheaitened, and the government alarmed,
by reflecting, that their lofles fiom the
ftlifting of commerce into other channels,
and not only of their manufa&ures, but
manufacturers, to other places, would be
permanent and irretrievable; whereas on
our fide, they would be temporary facri
fices for durable and valuable acquisitions.
Secondly. The resolutions would have
the effect of encreafing our marine, and
thereby at once cheapening and fecuririg
the carriage of onr productions, and pro
viding for our fafety. These advantages
having been already fufficiently explained,
need not, he said, be again developed.
It had been remarked by a member
from Maflachufetts, (Mr. Ames) that if,
as dated by a report of Mr. Jefferfon,
Great-Britain was so often at war, her
wars, by depriving us of her (hipping,
would soon have the wished eflcft, of re
placing it with American (hipping. This
reasoning Mr. M. said, supposed what was
contrary to prudence and probability.

It had been said that our tonnage was
prored by the official returns to be in
creasing with an unexampled rapidity.
To this Mr. M. answered ; that the in
crease ought not to be compared with o~
tlier examples, but with our own natural
faculties, and reasonable expe&ations
that the increase of our population requir
ed an annual increase of at'leaft five per
cent ; that an a.Tumption by foreigners
of American names, had probably increa
sed the apparent quantity of our (hipping ;
that the war or preparations for it, by
withdrawing foreign (hipping, had proba
bly also had some little temporary effeift ;
that the principal cause of the increase,
was the extenlion of our trade with the
French dominions, whichi some members
seemed so little inclined to secure and fof
ter, by measures which appeared to him
belt fitted for the purpose.
He reminded the committee of an ar
gument, which had, on former occasions,
been much p'refled by several mercantile
members, for encouraging our own navi
gation ; to wit: that American vefftls,
from a spirit of enterprise, and a unison
between private and public interests, would
explore new fields of commerce, and new
markets for our produce, which foreign
carriers would leave unattempted. Tiie
trade to China opened by American vel
fcls, had been often ascribed to this cause.
Mr. M. said the argument seemed to be
countenanced also, by the present state of
our mediterranean trade j which had, since
our independence, been confined by the
Barbary corsairs to foreign bottoms. Pre
vious to the revolution, when American
vessels could be the carriers, the trade was
very considerable. Since the excluflon of
our vessels, though the carriage of our
produce is fafe to Britilh, and several other
foreign vessels, yet this branch of trade
had withered as much as most others have
grown. In 1790, the exports cleared for
the mediterranean, were but 31,726 dol
lars ; and in the year following, the im
ports no more than n,J22 dollars.
Thirdly. Another efFect incident to
the proposed measure, would be an addi
tional encouragement to domestic manu
factures.
A gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.
Dexter) had said, he could read no fucli
tendency in the propositions. Mr. M.
Thought it impoflible to read the propo
sitions with attention, and not perceive,
that they mud have the like tendency
with the other means, by which manufac
tures had been promoted. If the dutiet
already laid, were calculated to produce
this effect, an increase of those duties in
any instance, mull have a tendency to in
crease the effect. In answer to the ob
jection that, a change in the policy of
Great-Britain, might put an end to the
additional duties, and ensnare those who
should proceed under the influence of them,
he remarked, I. That the fame might be
said in some degree of the regulations now
in force. A treaty with Great-Britain
might ftipulatc changes which would af
fect our manufacturers. But as there was
a just confidence, that the intcrefts of this
dafs of citizens would in this cafe be at
tended to by the government j it might
be expetted, that equal attention would
be paid to them, in any other cafe. 2.
The progress of things in this country,
and the probable acceflion of foreign ma
nufacturers, might be relied on to support
whatever undertakings (hall have once got
a footing.

SALEM, Feb. i
From the Wejl Indi:
We hare rery diljgreeable accounts.â
Capt- Thos. Wtbb, arrived here last week
from St. Eullatia, brings intelligence,that
the British have adopted a policy towards
the neutral powers, which affe&s the A
merican commerce in a very ferions man
ner ; that in pursuance of a proclamat ion
and mflros6tions;of the British couit,bear-
ing date the * 6th of November, which
Capt. Webbfaw and read, the armed vef
Â£ei* of that nation take all neutrals trad
ing to or from the French islands, and
feiud them into port for adjudication.â
Many ve'Tek have been sent into the En
gEih ports in consequence of this order,
and numbers ltave been condemned at
Montferr-t; among which is the brig Two
Brothers, Endicot, of this port, and
fcFiooner Pe:icock, Blaney, of Marble
head. The brig Hind, Putnam, of this
part, and the fthoorier Rachel, I,ec, of
Cape-Ann, were there, among others,
waitiug a trial.
IV Swedes and Danes fliare the fame
fate with the Americans.
We are informed that the British admit
the Americans freely into those French
ports, which they have taken poffefiion of
in Hifpaniola, upon the fame footing on
which the British themselves trade there.
Their obje& i& to reduce all the French
ifiands this winter; and the preventing
their receiving supplies from neutrals,they
consider as one principal mean of efFe&-
irig it. Hence proceed the orders for
their depredations on neutral commccce.
*We da not wtlll to doubt the veraci
ty of Capt. W. but we (halt not neglect
to inform the public, that no such procla
mation as he fays he has seen, has ever
been publilied in the London Gazette,
from the lit of Nov. to the 7th Dec. &
that all the proclamations of the British
court are invariably published in thet Ga
zette. We cannot at the fame time for
bear mentioning, that many merchants in
Salem give no credit whatever to theintel
ligence ; but on the contrary, inform that
letters were received by Capt. W. con
taining intelligence of a direst contrary
nature.
BOSTON, Feb. 26.
IMPORTANT MEETING!
The public have already been inform
ed of the meeting of the inhabitants of
this town, to take into consideration the
embarralTments under which ourcommerce
labours ; and of the appointment of a com
mittee of thirteen to report thereon.
On Monday last, at lp o'clock, that
committee made their report, in which
they dated a number of embarraflments
under which our commerce generally, and
carrying trade in particular, now labours,
and others which may be expe&ed to a
rise upon the arrival of peace.
Toeffeft a removal of those exifljng,
and to guard those whicli may be appre
hended in the event of peace among the
European nations, the committee fubjoin
cd sundry resolutions for the town to a
dqpt ; the molt of which were only de
claratory of certain principles and opini
ons, upon which to bottom one, recom
mending a discrimination against Britain
and Spain, by imposing new duties on
their veflcls and goods.
After the report was read, the debates
were opened thereon, by Mr. RufTell,
Mr. Jones, Mr. Euftis, and Mr. Codman
who were in the minority of the report
ing committee; and who now opposed
the report. On the other fide it was sup
ported by Dr. Jarvis, Mr. Morton, and
Mr. Austin, who were in the majority
of the fame-committee. This debate, in
which, beside -the above gentlemen, great
numbers took a part, was continued un
(3 near 2 o'clockP. M. when the town ad
journed to meet at the Old-South Meet
ing House, at 3 o'clock, (the inhabitants
who attended being too numerous for Fa
neuil-Hall) When the debate was resum
ed. and continued nntil dark : the town
then adjourned to ten o'clock, yesterday
morning, when the debate was again re
sumed, and kept up with much fpirit,un
til near one.
The queftidn was then taken upon this
motion :
" That the further confidfration of
the Report be inferred without day"
And upon a division of the houfe,there
Sheared a very large majority in favour
of Uijf i cference.
The meeting was then di.Tol.cd,
Never did we fee a fuller meeting :
and never were debates more fairly con
qnfted. We cannot omit mentioning in
a particular manner, Mr. Otis, who took
a confpieuous part in the course of the
debate, in opposition to the report ; his
fellow-eitizens did jullicc to his abilities,
and eloquence.
The arguments used by the gentlemen
in oppofitton to the Report, displayed an
extensive knowledge of our commerce,its
natural and permanent advantages, as
well as its present embarrafiments ; and
they were so convincing, as to fatisfv a
large majority, that it was inexpedient for
the town to declare any opinion as to the
measures proper to remove these embarraf
ments; but rather to leave the whole buii
nefs with Congress, where it ought con
stitutionally to reside.
" The People" of the United States,
in the Constitution which they have a
dopted, have declared, that " Gongrefs
shall have the exclusive power of regulat
ing Commerce with foreign nations"â
and " the People" are detei mined to sup
port the Constitution !
The late Meeting has done, and will
do much goodâlt will strengthen the o
pinions of our Delegates in Congrcfs,and
convince them, that as long as they are
just and patriotic, their constituents will
support them. It also fliews, that when
the mercantile and mechanic profeflions
have time to delibeiate, they fee their
best interefls, and pursue them.

REFORM IN PENAL LAWS,
jExtraS from a Return made by the Grand
Jury to the Court of General Quarter
Sejfions, held in March 1794, in and for
the County of Philadelphia.
" Among the various duties which the
Grand Jury have found it incumbent on them
to discharge, tlie visiting of the prisons forms
a very important one. The polity of our
prisons for offenders, and our penal laws being
new, and essentially different from those of
other places, we have been the mere a: icntivc
to their effeCts ; and it affords us much fatis
fa<Â£tionin being able to fay, that we have found
order, decency, economy, and induftiy, pre
vailing throughout the hovfe âP.rii> attention
to the moral conduct of the prisoners, and di
vine worship frequently performed. The
number of prisoners has greatly decreasedâ
there are few or none of them who are not en
gaged in some ufeful and productive employ
ment, which not only begets habits of industry
and order in the house, but qualifies them for
ufefulnefs when returned to focictyâat which
time the balance procured by their labour is
delivered to them, either in cloathing or mo
ney, at the discretion of the infpeClors of the
prison. While we contemplate this agreea
ble change, it is with no less pleasure we find
the benefits to fooiety, many and important.
The attention of the infpe&or? who have the
direction of the prison, merits our approba
tion.
The exertions of Captain Weed, the late
keeper (who fell a victim to his benevolent
exertion* as a father and a friend during the
late affixing calamity) in promoting the or
der and security of this place, also demands
our grateful acknowledgments : And whjlft
we mention his services, we feel it a duty to
notice the good order and management which
is still preserved under the fuperintend?we of
his Widow, who from theuectafeof herhuf
band until the present time,has had the charge
of this placeâand we cannot bu J recommend
her as a person well qualified under the present
order of that place, to perform the duties
annexed to it.

an Indian, appeared in the vicinity of this
cantonment, bearing a white flag. They
were received, by order of the Command

where they opened their bufmefs, and in
formed that they came from the Delaware
nation, with proposals of peaceâthat they
were fan&ioned by the Shswanefe and o

An EfTay on Slavery:
Drfigned to exhibit in a new point of viey,
its effects on morals, indujiry, and the peace of
ociety. Some facts and calculations are offered
to prove the labor ofjrccncn to be much more
produflivc than that ot Jlaves ; that countries are
rich, powerful and happy, in proportion as the
laboring people enjoy the fruits of their own
labor ; and hence the n ctfTjiy oonclufun, that
slavery is impolitic as well as unjnjl.
