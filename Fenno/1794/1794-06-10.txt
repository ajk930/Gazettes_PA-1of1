for the spoliations they have committed
on American veflels."

Sir,
A Itrmger arrived in a new country
with whose opinions, habits, and manners,
he has but that imperfett acquaintance
which is formed by literary correfpon
dtnce, v.iil be fafer by preserving a fe
fj-eclfu' distance from, than by an inti
mate union witbj any party who may step
forward ar.d endeavor by a flattering ad
driis lo prepofitfs his mind in their fa-
Vir.
Your anfwef to the address of the De
nocratic Soeiety cf New-York, is modcft
ind dec ent, it conveys ideas of peace ai;d
harmony with all the World, but diffeiing
fn m their expectations.
They hoped to find in yon the enemy of
thofc who have persecuted youâtheytruf
ted tbr.t you weie like themfelve* unable
to forgive injuries or to forget wrongs
done.ii/ or to, themselves ; that becauie
you have written and preached in favor of
the Unity of the Deity, you therefore,
with liitm, were adverle to the principles
of Chriitinnity, inculcated ill the sermon
"of Jefys (brill, delivered on the Monnt
tif dives, <v herein he tells US that " Blrf
" fed are the reaej-makers for they fliall
" be called the Children of God," Matt.
v. 9. " BleiTed are ye when men (hall
" revile y;u, and persecute you, and fay
" all manner of Evil again 3: you falfely, for
my fake; Rejoice and be glad: For great
â "is your Reward in Heaven: For so
persecuted they the Prophets, which
" were before you," Matt. v. 11 and 12.
Your answer to them convinces a number
of your friends that they were and are
mistaken in their ideas of your refent
mer.ts. There are few men in America,
who will not be happy in the acquain-
tance of a person diiiinguifhed as ypu are
by your researches in philosophy and ma
thematicsâand the moderation of your
enquiries into moral, natural, and revealed
religion, and you will reap in this Wes
tern World a tempoial enjoyment of a
well earned reputation, if yoit preserve
yourfelf from the spirit of party.
But, Sir, you ?.rc in dangerâa party
is endeavoring to make a merit to them
selves of your weight and influenceâBe-
ware, Sir,, of calling it into the fca'e on
cither fide. In the preponderant scale,
its value wiil be ijft by a sri xturc with the
majorityâin the lighter scale it will kick
the beam with yonrafTociates and be found
wanting :âPreferve it then; for rhe good
of mankind, by your guarded conduct,
and let us (who have only heard from a
ditlance) fee that your virtues are truly
Chnftian, tho' you express doubts of the
Divinity of our Saviour; that you believe
in the rr.efiage, tho' you doubt the cha
â¢ rafter attributed to the Meflenger, and
that persecuted in one City you have fled
to another, only for peace and repose.
Be afflired Sir, that there is no perfe
ction here against opinion?, and that
however different your's may be from
that of the majority, you may write, print
or preach them, without danger of per
secution of any kind ; and that while we
are inftrufted by those parts, of your doc
trines, which with freedom we imbibe, we
fhnll never be angry because we cannot
fublcribe to those which we reject, nor
fuipeft you of being displeased for the
Cxercife of our free will.
Conducting yourfelf in this way, your
private virtues, your indultry in the pur
s iit of knowledge ufeful to mankind, will
render ypur name refpefted as Franklin's
â-by a contrary conduit, by coalescing
with any' party whatever, you will cer
tainly diminish your.fame as much as the
opposite party is proportioned to that

the merger of that party, fink the whole

ommerce.
not been his wifli, Mr.
'-."ilorverj, tmt this, question
'â  ' "uught forward at the preient
time. As it was, however, be r ore the
House, as he approved the motiies of his
colleague, who made .the motion, and as
he perfedtly concurred with him :n opini
on on the fubjedt, he should make a few
concifc observations.
He believed he said that in a govern
ment (nth as that of this coiintry, it was
the peculiar duty of those, to whom the
administration has been committed, to ex
tend security and protection to all the in
terelb, and redress for all the injuries of
the citizens. That inexcusable and unex
ampled injuries had been perpetrated, and
an immense value in property unjufily spoil
ed, and that the honor of our country had
been insulted, without provocation, were
facts admitted by all. Those whose pro
pel ty had been the sport of wanton viola
tion, which in many inftartces had reduced
the fufferers from ease and affluence, to
want and mifsry ; come forward and de
mand redress and indemnification. That
they were entitled to such indemnification,
from the nature of our social compact he
understood to be agreed by every gentle
man. (Here Mr. S. was interrupted by
several members, and Mr. Nicholas and
Mr. Smilie declared that in their opinion, 1
there was no obligation to indemnify the
fufferers, except it were done cut of a fund
to be formed by the sequestration of Bri.
tifh debts.) Mr. S. said he was much o
bliged to the gentlemen for setting him
right; till now he had believed that the
right of the fufferers to indemnification
was denied by none. If this however was
Really a question, yet to be decided, it
Was due to the fufferers, it was due to our 1
own honor to decide it without delay.
It was asked, he said, by what means
is the government to administer- redress;
They were lirft to apply to the govern
ments which had infli&ed the injuries, to
state their nature, and extent, and to de
mand in unequivocal terms redress. This
bufincfs notwithstanding all the opposition
which had been made was happily irt a
proper train. He hoped, and believed
the application would be effedlual. It
might however fail; and in that cafe he
was free to declare, that we owed it to our
honor, and to our injured citizens, to at
tempt redress by means of the Fall, resort.
In that unhappy event, the interest of the
fufferers must be involved with the general
interests of the nation, and must abide the
result-os war.
But if fatisfaflion should not be obtain
. Ed by negociation,Â«and should the govern
j nient from any political confederation, not
seek redress by force in such events, the
fufferers would have a just claim on their
country for indemnification.
The question now immediately before
the House was, to fefer the motion for
indemnification to the committee of the
whole on the fubjedt of sequestration.
This was not fair, as refpe&ed that part
of the Hojife who approved the engage
ment to indemnify, and who would never
consent to sequestration. It was not fair
as refpe&ed the fufferers, because he be
lieved there was not a gentleman in the
House who supposed that the measure of
sequestration would prevail. He was asto
nished that any should believe that it
ought to be adopted. He liimfelf with
out hesitation approved of engaging to
indemnify the fufferers ; but at the fame
time with all his heart, he abhorred seques
tration and confifcation of debts as the
measures which all civilized nations had
for more than a century abandoned as im
moral and unjust.
He would not now enter into a difcufTi
on of the question of sequestration. When
ever it came directly under consideration,
he pledged himfelf ro undertake to prove
that it was againit the law of nations, that
it was immoral, unjust, and impolitic. He
had been sorry to perceive that the feelings
of the mover of that proposition (Mr.
Dayton) were wounded, by the terms in
which gentlemen had spoken of his mo
tion. He himfelf, in his conscience, be
lieved it to be immoral and unjust, and as
such he felt himfelf bound as a man of ho
nor to give it his strenuous opposition.
The gentleman surely could not reasonably
expect that independent men, would fa
crifice opinion to politeness or to friend
ship. All he could do and that he did
with pleasure, was to dcclare that he be
lieved the gentleman's motives were pure
and upright, and that he had a perse&
confidence in the correftnefs of his moral
lentiments.
SENEX.
Viewing the fubjeft in the light he had
cxprefTed, he appealed to the candor and
fairnels of gentlemen, to what tended the
combining of those irritative questions of
[ indemnification and sequestration, hut to
j wound the feelings and evade the just ap
plication of the fufferers ? f
he said, had charged his
colleage, and those who had supported his
motion, with attempting, by these means,
meanly to court popularity. To refute
this chargo would, in his opinion, be un
necessary, because no well-informed man
in America could believe it. He did not
know that the opinions, which were held
by his friends and himfelf, on this fubje<Â£t,
were popular. It was fufficient that they
were believed to be just. Was he, how
ever, disposed to recriminate, by disclos
ing motives which were not avowed, but
concealed, he could tell a tale, which, he
believed, would be heard with effeÂ£k.
From the commencement of the admi
nirt;ration of this government, certain gen
tlemen, and particularly those of the eastern
states, had been charged with regulating
i their political conduct by local considerati
ons. That they had difregaided the inter
[ eft of every part of the United States, but
the particular diftri&s of the country from
I which they came. The charge was now
' reversedâthose diflri&s have fuffered in
j finitely beyond their neighbors, by the ef
i fefts of those measures of which we com
! plain; and notwithstanding all this, the re
-1 prefentatives of those diftri&s all at

PHILADELPHIA,
JUNE 10.
From a Corrcfp^ndint.
The diforganizers of this country who
pretend to be the (launch friends of liber
ty, have long since forfeited all right to
that diflirguifhed character.
The rial friends of the equal rights of
man, while they lincerely rejoice at the
triumphs of freedom and justice in every
quarter of the globe, regret excefles which
not only tarnilh the lustre of the belt of
causes, but put to hazard the eventual es
tablishment of a fret government.
The partizans of discord on the other
hand, have uniform-y Ihouted hofannas to
the triumphing faction in France, let it
consist of whom it will, and have jultified
the measures of men who have destroyed
each other Can this be right ?
Jn the General Advertiser of Friday la ft,
there is however a paragraph which devi
ated for a moment from this hitherto uni
form line of condu&. The fate of the
celebrated Danton who has fallen tinder
the axe of the guillotine, through the pre
valence of a competitorâis there attribu
ted " to the manoeuvres of the aristocrats"
ânor is this all, the exigence of rival fac
tions is not only recognized, but it is also
con. r e[Tcd that, instigated by the aristocrats
thefc fadlions destroy each other. This
was going too farâit was a concefiion in
favor of truth and common sense, that lays
the axe to the root of the whole system of
anarchyâthe next day we accordingly
find in the General Advertiser another
tune is introducedâthe man who it is fug.
gelled, has fallen a vi<3im to aristocracy,
is denounced as a Traytor, an ambitious,
avaricious wretch. It is now said, " his
love of money directed his steps in the
high road to the guillotine ," that he was
"lepeatedly bribed, and in Belgia purloin
ed a large sum of money that he had
" risen from poverty to the possession of
immense fortune, which he must have ac
cumulated by malpractices âif bring
ing such a man to the guillotine is aristo
cratic, (and this is affcrted in the General
Advertiser,) what mull the people of
France think of Arillocracy ?

PARIS, April 3.
Danttm and tht at bet Dtputiet.
. After the reading of the ast of accusa
tion and the report of Saint-Just; Amar,
the Public Accuser requested that Gene
ral Weftermann Should be brought frpm
tbc Conciergerie, in order to be tried with
the Deputies. This request was compli
ed with.
As soon as General Weftermann arri
ved, the Revolutionary Tribunal proceed
ed to the examination of evidence against
himâCambon, the Deputy, was exami
natedâHis dcpofuion related entirely to
Fabre d' Eglantine, Delaunay d' Angers,
and ChabotâHe developed the measures
adopted by the Committee of Five, to
suppress the Finance Companies and to
tftablifh the credit of Aflignats, and he
disclosed the manner in which the three
Deputies alluded to, had altered the de
cree parted by the Convention, relative to
the Eall India Compnny.
As the Tribunal were on the point of
adjourning, Danton aad Philippcaux re
queued leave to communicate freely with
their defendersââThis request was acced
ed to.
April 4.
In pursuance of the rcquifition of the
public accuser, Lullier, procurer general
of the department of Paris, in consequence
of his intimate connexion with the Baron
de Batz, who has made his escape, was
ordered to be tried with the Deputies.
The Revolutionary Tribunal then proceed
ed to the examination of witnefles, but
Danton and the other deputies declared
that they would answer no questions, ex
cept in the prefencc of Roberfpierre, Bar
rere and Saint-Just.
The President of the revolutionary
tribunal, and the public accuser, attempt
ed to induce them to depart from this de
termination. Their attempts, however,
were ineffe&ual. The tribunal, in conse
quence of this event, suspended the trial,
and a report was ordered to be presented
to the Convention.

The decree patted by the Convention,
together with the letter received by the
Committee of public and general fafety,

to answer interrogatories, unless Roberf-,
piene, Barrere, and St. Just, were sum

inveighed in very strong terms against the
judges.
In conference of the mode of conduit

And guardian science marks it for her own ;
No sorrOws here obtrude upon the eye,
But such as fancy may perchance supply ;
Woes such as these that penetrate the heart
When Whitlock ftr.kes it in fond Zara's

Oh long be acting such 4s hers a'low'd,

To wealth and peace and plenty let it join,
What e'er can foften, meliorate, refine.
Mean while for her still may it smooth the

Alike ftiall charm on either fide the seas;
Of jarring nations, form the mutual care,

The Public are cautioned to
beware of counterfeited Five Dollar Hilts of
the Bank of the United States, and Twenty
Dollar Bills of the Bank of Nort/x
several of which have appeared in circulation
within a few days pajl; they are a good ge
neral imitation of the genuine bills, but may
be dijtinguijhed by the following
MARKS.
Fife Dollar Bills of the Bank of the
Untied States.
ALL that have appeared bars the letter F.
for their Alphabetical Mark.
The Texture of the Papj?r is thicker and
whiter and it takes the ink more freely than
the genuine paper.
The O. in the word Company is fmalier
tf.an the M* and other letters of that word,
so that a line extended fÂ» oni the top of the (),
to touch the top of the M wirblii extend con.
fiderably above tÂ»6 range ot ihe whole word.
In the word United the letters are n&rrow
erand closer together than thÂ« reft o? the bill
The i and fin the word promiie are not
parallel, the f inclining much in ore forward
I than the i.
The engraving is badly cxecu<od,?be ftiokes
of all the Letters are stronger and the dev. e
in the margin particularly is much coaifcr and
appears darker tiian in the tiue bills. Some
ot the counterfeit's bear date in 1791âWhere
as thÂ® Batik was not in operation till Decern
ber, and no five dollar bills were illued in
jhat year.
Twenty Dollar Bills of the Bank of North
America,
ALL that have appeared have ihe letter
B. for their alphabetical mark.
They are printed on a paper nearly similar
to that of the counterfeit Five Dollar Notes
above defenbed ; the engraving is bcttei Â£xe
ucted, and they approach nearer to the ap.
pearance of the genuine bills.
The fine ruled Ikies through the word Ttcen.
t\y in the body ot ihe bill, are Â»n number thir
teen in the geniiiue b lis, and but twelve in
the countcifeits.
The word Company is much like the fame
word in tire Five Dollar Btlis as delcr ibed ?>
bove, the 0 being lets than the m, and others
following.
There is no stroke to the t in the word North
whereas in the genuine bibs the stroke is well
defined.
The letters ent-in the word Twcnt)*, to the
left hand at the bottom, do not come down to
the line, but are so cut as to give an irregular
appearance to the woul, the 7 w and 'hey go
ing below them. â¢
The signature ] N'xon, has thf appear
ance ot tuing written with Lmb-tlack and
oil, and jtiifers Irom other inks used in
printing the bills and tlÂ»e c.iHiitr's signature.

Other counterfeit bills

The denomination is of TWENTY DOL
LARS,and the alphabetical mark is the let

They may br distinguished from the genu
ine by the to! lowing Ml AUKS :
The p&pf r of : iie counterfeits is of a move
tend > texture and giofley lurlace than the
genuine, and thc;e is no water ftoark in them*
The letter C. in the word Cashier, in Â»he
true bills is fti marked, whereas in the
counterfeits, 'he whole letterMs a fine hair
stroke, evidently, i. an unfinifned state. 1 lie
letter a in the wo id demand, is badly formed
and the whole word iii done, ahd there is no
comma at tie end of it, as there is in tbe
genuine bills.
The marginal device, is much daiker iÂ»
the fa Me, than in the genuine bills owing to
the Ih.ide strokes being cr-.irfer, much nearer
together and cÂ©nVequt?iÂ»ti'y inuch more nu
