(To be Continued.)
For the Gt.zt.nt.of the United States.
Mr. Fenno,
As there Lave been misrepresentations ref
peft.ng the military bill, lately rejected
in the House of Representatives, the
fadts attending the progress of that fuV
jest should be known, and the public
will then be able to judge without com
ment on the propriety of the rejection.
On the original motion of Mr. Sedsr.
wick, at a time when the probability of
war ieemrd great, a refolutiou on a mo
tion of tnat gentleman was adopted, Â« that
ttie jtiiliiary force of the United States
ought to be rendered more efficient."
This was committed to a feleft committee
of nine, of yery different and opposite po
litical opinions and connexions. The re
port of this committee was unanimous. It
confided of four parts, I, to compleat the
present military eitablifhment; 2, to de
tach 80,000 men from the militia ; 3, to
raise a corps of art ilk ri its and engineers ;
and 4, to augment the military establish-
ment in cafe of war.
The three firft, after some discussion,
were adopted. Reflecting the lad there
was much opposition. The resolutions of
the (elect committee proposed delegating
an authority to the Pretident to decide on
the f act of the'exijiene of war ; and in
that event to commence the augmentation
of the military force. This delegation of
authority was made the principal ground
of opposition. After considerable discus
sion, Mr. Mercer proposed that the reso
lutions should be adopted and a bill re
ported to purport an immediate railing of
the force, that the bill might remain un
determined till towards the close of tVie
fellion, and then be rendered in its opera
tion direst or provisional, as the circuai-
Uances of the country might require.
This proposition was acceded to almost
urianimoudy ; the number of men, to wit,
25,000, which was proposed by General
Irvine was, it is believed, reported unani
mously, and a bill accordingly reported.
On the discussion of this bill, Mr. Sedg
wick believing on the one hand, that the
circumflances of the United States were
not so urgent as to authorise tK> expence
of immediately raising an army; and on
the other, that the abandoning altogether
the obtaining an efficient force was not
authorised by our present profpe&s, pro
posed to amend the bill by the following
lections:
Sec. 1. That there ffiall be raif d, upon
the terms and conditions herein after menti
oned, an additional provisional military force
to consist of non commissioned tifficers,
privates and musicians, together with a pro
per proportion of commiffioijed officers.
Sec. 2. And be it further enacted that
the non commissioned officers, privates and
mulicians, to be raised as aforefaid, ffiall be
inlifted upon these conditions, (to wit) un
less war ihall break out betwe n the United
States and some European power, they shall
not be liable to be called into (ervice for
more than days in a year, and then
only for the purpose of being muftsred, ex
erciled and trained. But if war (hail break
out with any European power, then they
(hall be bound to serve for tine term of three
years after the breaking out of such war,
or during the continuance thereof as they
(hall relpeftively engage; and every non
commissioned officer, private and musician
ffiall be entitled by virtue of his inliftment,
if to serve for a term of three years in cafe
of war, to an allowance of dollars, and
if to serve during the continuance of Inch
war to an allowance of dollars, and
yearly thereafter until the breaking out of
war,.(if the fame ihall happen )to the further
allowance of dollars.
And be it further enacted that for every
day of attendance or service of a Commission
ed officer, previous to the break ng out of
war, he ffiall be entitled to pay and fub
fifence, after the rate of the monthly pay
and iubfiftence now allowed to the officer's
of the army, according to the grade of such
commissioned officer, and for every day of
attendance or service of a non-commissioned
officer, private or musician, previous to the
breaking out of war, he ffiall be entitled to
the compensation of tents per day ; and
in the cafe of the breaking out of such war
the laid commissioned officers, non-commif
lioned officers, privates and musicians ffiall
remain the fame pay and allowances in all
relpeas as the troops on the military efta
bhffiroent of the United States ; and they
Ihall alio as well before as after the breaking
out of such war, be. governed by and fub
jeet to the rules and articles of war which
have been or ffiall be eftabliffied by law.
And be it further ena&ed that it ffiall be
lawtul for the President of the United States
previous to the breaking out of such war, to
alterable and keep together,, with their con
tent, such and so many of the officers and
non-commissioned officers aforefaid, as he
may think proper lor the purpose of being
inftru&ed and exercised ; which officers and
non-commissioned officers so alTembled ffiall
during the time they are together receive the
like pay and allowances to which they would
be entitled in time of war.
And be it further enacted that if war ffiall
not break out with some European power
withm a f ter t ( le passing of this ast
e ]| m ' force be raised as aforefaid!
Be it further ena&ed, that the non-com
fV mTI, Â° ffice ; s 'PP rivates and musicians
e llt y e Â°f their engaging in the ser
vice aforefaid, shall, during their relpeftive
rantannce th in> be ex Â« mp(ed Â«*Â«Â£
.performance of any militia duty.
By these it will appear that neither
ilumber of men, nor time of service were
fi*ed by the motion ; the fiirlple question
was whether any provision should be made
to augment the military force in caie war
{hould break out ? Whether those who
supported, or those who rejected this mea
sure were right, the public will judge ;
whether it was the duty of the I-ejfifkture
to give aidto negociatii>n,9r provide by a
liable force for the defence ot the country
or not ?' It will undoubtedly appear that
the bill which was rejected was not Mr.
Sedgwick's bill, but a bill in exaÂ£V con
formity to the resolutions of the Hou'feâ
It was not a bill for railing a Handing ar
my of 25,000 men.

OSTEND, March 12.
On Saturday last a tifherman came in
here with the account that on the pre
ceding day he spoke a Swedish veflef, com
ing from Sweden and bound for Dunkirk,
laden with cannon powder &c. and which
had several French soldiers on board
The Swedish Captain desired the fifhcr
man to give him a man to pilot him into
Dunkirk which he could not refufe him,
whereupon he continued his voyage. The
fifherman having made this leport, the
commander of the English men of war
here, dispatched immediately a cutter in
order to take the Swedish vefTel: but the
cutter not being returned yet, and a ttrong
easterly wind blowing it is feared the
Swedish vefTel has reached Dunkirk before
the cutter could come up with it,; the
day before yesterday an English transport
arrived here from London, with 12 beau
tiful horses on board for the Duke of
York, which the king makes him a pre
lent of.

LONDON, February 28.
The Lawyers employed on the fubjeft
of the marriage of his Royal Highness
Pi ince Frederick with Lady A. Murray,
have had several meetings. The result
of their deliberation is favourable to the
young couple. Marriages solemnized
abroad are, by various Adts of the 13ri
tifh Parliament, recognized in this coun
try ; and the Ast of Parliament, which
was passed in the beginning of theprefent
rei g n > prohibiting the marriage of any
of the Royal family, without the consent
of his Majesty, and on which the present
application for a divorce is founded, does
not extend to marriages contrasted abroad.
Nothing can, therefore, invalidate the
union which took place between his Roy
al Highness and his Princels â¢in Italy, al
though themarriage here may be annulled.
A reputable mercantile house iti the
city had a recent and urgent claim made
on them by their French correspondents
of 26,0001. but, as it was supposed to
be done in conference of the late order

Extract of a letter from Captain Wilt*,
Simpfori, of the (hip Ark, bound fconi
London to Ancona.
7*oulon, January 1
This iff the firft day I have librrtv
granted nÂ»e to write you, and I am ferry
to have to inform you, of mv being taken
on the 31ft of December, in theouterlav
of Toulon".
I arrived at Gibraltar the 17th, and on
the 18th a fignijl for a convoy to the eÂ»ft.
ward was hoilted on board the Arddt.
On the Igth I went on board, and re
ceived my in!)nitons for Toulon, as theie
were none for Leghorn : but that from
Toulon there was an opportunity every
day, and was informed that they (hou'd
get under way as scon as it moderated,
which was in the afternoon of the f* m Â«
day. Foil- {hips and a frigate (the fa id
frigate came in two days before us, and
shared the fame fate) and I got under
way, in company with several othei3, and
failed. The next day we could fee no.
thing of our convoy. I kept along thi
coafl of Spain, and saw nothing to trou
ble us. In the Gulph of Lyons we L-u
several English and Spanifb men
but not one of them came to speak wit!
us.
On the 31ft ult. we came off this placd,
and feeing all appear friendly, and white
colors hoisted on all the fotts, we flood in,
to the outer bay ; I put the (hip about to
(land out again, when it fell calm all at
once ; and the Grand Fort of
poured the (hot so quick upon us, aod a
large boat being a-head, full of soldiers,
I was obliged to ftrikc, and now am in
close confinement, in company witfc my
two mates, without money, deaths, or
friends.
We have been well used finee we have
been prifonets.
P. S. Dated Feb. 16. Since I wrote
you the above, there have been three mora
-nglifh vessels taken ; one in the harbor
from Gueinfey, a Captain Wood, and a
Captain Barrel), of Yarmouth. Since
Lord Hood left this, thrre have been or
16 vessels, Spanish and Englilh taken in the
harborâso you may judge what a good
look out is kept by the Englifn.

EDINBURGH, February 28.
The House of Lords, on Friday last,
heard council in the Appeal from the
Court of Sefiion ; Reid, King, and Co.
of New-York, Vgaintt Me(frs. Coats, of
Glalgow, and reversed the decree on the
motion of Lord Thurlow. This judg
ment establishes an important point in
mercantile law, contrary to a train of de
cisions in the Court of Session, viz-
That when a bill of Exchange is given
not in the usual eourfe, but deposited aÂ»
a collateral security for a debt, the person
with whom it is deposited, mull negociate
it, or do diligence just as in the common
cafe of foreign bills, otherwise he makes
it his own ; and if the money is loft by
his negligence, it mud be accounted as
payment of the original debt. In th!Â»
cafe, the terms of the receipt given for
the deposited bill were, that the taking it
(hould not exonerate the acceptors, &c.
of the original hill, unlefe actual pay
ment was made ; but the House declared,
that these words did not exepmt the hold
er from the obligation to negociate duly.

NASSAU, April 22.
Although the winds have been extreme
. ly favorable for veflels from the continent,
for a fortnight proceeding Monday, we
are without any later intelligence from
that quarter, than has already been given
in this Gazette.
From this circumflance, we are led to
believe that the greatest diligence has been
nfed in communicating the order for the
embargo throughout the dates, and that
it has been rigidly enforced.
Some of the Amcncan political writers
are of opinion, that the efforts made to
dij*cÂ£t the ftrcam of labor towards manu
factures and commerce, have been already
productive of injury to their country, and 1
if; persevered in, may be of infinite detri
ment to her interests. I
A country thinly inhabited, and pro
ductive of the fruits of the earth, invites '
td. agricultural pursuits. The cheapncfs
of land compensates in a certain ratio for 1
the high price of laborâbut that due
proportion must be loft, when in a coun- '
try thus circumstanced, a fondnefs for ,
manufactures and (hipping is allowed to
fupercede the attention requisite for the ]
cultivation of the earth.
New-England indeed forms an excep- r
tion to this observation. There, a nu
merous population, sterile foil, and long )
winter, compel the inhabitants to have
recoui fe to other means for acquiring sub- 1
fiftence, than what the culture of the earth
affords. The fifheries on their coasts in
vite to naval employment: And it will be 1
fjund on enquiry, that of the native Ame
rican seamen, full two-thirds are New- I
England men.
Of the crews that navigate the (hips ll
belonging to the middle and fouthcrn
states, it is truly surprising what a small \
proportion are Americans. Let the na
tives of England, Scotland and Ireland, E
be taken from the American veflels, and
very few seamen indeed will be left to man I,
cither a commercial or military navy.
These things will of course, correct
thcmfelves. There is a certain level, or P
proportion, if you will, that however dis
tributed at times, will eventually take Si
place. And perhaps the present -embar-
M , f
raflments of America may accelerate the
y ascertaining of this desideratum in her po
i- litical economy.

J PHILADELPHIA,.
s MAY 22.
The vessel and cargo taken from Captain
Barney, arid condemned at Jamaica, is valu
ed at 56,000 dollars.
A correspondent suggests that Congress
can find rro difficulty in defraying the ex
pences of the proposed army of 25,000 men,
Â» since a very ingenious merfiber has discover
, ed a surplus in the Treasury of three millions
of dollars.
The estimated expence of the Provisional
corps was reported by the committee and
stated in the House of at
only 350,000 dollars: this in an incendiary
paragraph in a factious paper is swelled to
the enormous fiim of 4 millions: the quo
ariimo is eaftly seen through.
The inconsistency of certain paragraphs
and certain men is all of a piece with the
measures of a certain party : a perpetual ef
fort on the one hand to excite to war, and a
perpetual opposition to all the measures ne
cessary to condudt a war fuccefsfully.
By two refutations pafied yefttrday, in
the .House of Representatives, Cungrefs
â¢are to rife on the third of June, and meet
on the firll Monday of November.

The Public are cautioned to
beware of counterfeited Five Dollar Bilk of
the Bank of the United States, and Twenty
Dollar Bills of the Bank of North America,
several of which have appeared in circulation
within a few days pajl; they are a good ge
neral imitation of the genuine Bills, but may
be diflingui/hed by the following
MARKS.
Five Dollar Bills of the Bank of the
United States.
ALL that have appeared have the letter F.
for their Alphabetical Mark.
The Texture of the Paper is thicker and
whiter and it takes the ink more freely than
the genuine paper.
The O. in the word Company is smaller
than the M. and other letters of that word,
so that a line extended from the top of the O,
to touch the top of the M. would extend con
fidtrably above the range of the whole word.
In the word United the letters are narrow
erand closer together than the reft of the bill
The i and/in the word promise are not
parallel, the/inclining much more forward
thin the i.
The engraving is badly executed,the fti okes
of all the Letters are ft rouge r and the devi' e
in the margin particularly is much coarser and
appeal's darker than in the true bills. Some
el the counterfeits bear date in 1791âWhere
as the Bank was not in operation till Decern
ber, and no five dollar bills were ifTued in
lhat year.
Twenty Dollar Bills of the Bank of North
America.
ALL that have appeared have the letter
B. for their alphabetical mark.
They are printed on a paper neatly similar
to that of the Five Dollar Notes
above described; the engraving is bettei exe
ucted, and they approach nearer to tiie.ap
pearance of the genuine bills.
The fine ruled lines through the word Tain- (
in the body of the bill, are in number thir
teen in the genuine bills, and but twelve in
the counterfeits.
The word Company is much like the fame
word in the Five Dollar Bills as defer ibed a
bove, the 0 being less than them, and others
following.
There is no stroke to the t in the word North
whereas in the genuine bills the stroke is well
defined.
The letters ent in the word Twenty, tp the
left hand at the bottom, do not come down to
the line, but are so cat as to give an irregular
appearance to the word, the Tw and the 7 go
ing oelow them.
The signature J, Nixon, has the appear
ance of being written with lamb-black and
oil, and differs from other inks uftd in
printing the bills and the calhiei's lignature.
It is supposed thele forgeries were committed
in some of the Southern States, as all the coun
terfeits thai have appeared, have come trom
thence, and two persons have been apprehend
ed in Virginia,on suspicion of being the author
of i hem.
The reward of ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS
will be paid to any Perlon or Persons wfio (hail
difcovei and profccute to conviction the levelal
offenders of the following descriptions or any
of thcin, viz.
The peifon or persons, who manufaflured
the paper on which the Bills are printed.
The person or pet lons, who engiaved the
plates.
The printer or printers, of the bills.
Every person who has atted as a principal in
any othei way, in the counterfeiting'and utter
ing the said b Us.
Philadelphia, March 28, 1794
April 22, 1794,
Other counterfeit bills
of the Bank of the United States have appeared
in circulation.
The denomination is of TWENTY DOL
LARS,and the alphabeticalmaik is the let
ter JB.
They may be dillinguiflied from the genu
ine by the following MARKS :
The paper of the counterfeits is of a more
! tender texture and glofley furfacc than the
genuine, and there isno water mark in them.
The letter t.. in the word Cashier, in the
true bills is strongly marked, whereas in the
counterfeits, the whole letter is a fine hair
stroke, evidently in an unfinilhed state. The
letter a in the word demand, is badly formed
and the whole word ill dpne, and there is no
comma at the end of it, as there is in the
genuine bills.
h ma , r Â£'"?' device, is much daiker in
Ik* rt 'j' '' lan genuine bills owing to
e a e strokes being coarser, much nearer
ogt t.ier, and consequently much more nu
merous. This difference strikes the eye at firft
view. '

r T""HEgrand principle of Equafity, if right-

univerl'al justice, sacred. o: der, and perfect

insolence of office) the tyranny of p. Ide, and
the outrages of oppression ; confirms, in the
most forcible manner, the necessity of fub t Â»-

bands of society, that it maintains inviolate,-
evejy natural and every civil diftin&ion,
draws more cloTely every Jbcial tie, unites in
