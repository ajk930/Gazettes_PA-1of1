SUABILITY OF STATES.
I HAVE {Lid that foreign states arc
moral pcrfons, capable of right and -wrong.
They are so, not only in relation to one
another, but in relation to the iudividuals
of which each (late is composed. There
are legal and moral duties which sovereign
states owe to every member of the com
munity ; and if a state erer refufes to dis
charge its duties, the individual should
have a power, as well as an equitable right,
to enforce an observance of them. To
fay the contrary is to maintain a contra
diction. To fay that a state owes moral,
legal or political duties to its citizens,
which it is not under obligations to fulfill,
is an absurdity; and if there is an obliga
tion on a state to perform certain duties
to its citizens, there ought to be some tri
bunal to which every man mar refoy, and
demandjtJHce. It is not fufficient t6 fa
tisfy the mind, to fay that individuals have
the privilege of petitioning for their rights
Petitioning (hould be limited to unli
quidated claims, indefinite rights or mat
ters of opinion or favor. Matters of con
traÃ, fpecific rights, stand on a different
foundation. They always entitle to de
mand; and cotfne&ed with the right of
demanding is the right of process to pursue
and carry into effefit.âStates clearly have
a power to contract; and they pra&ife the
right of compelling the party who con
tracts with them, to fulfil his engagements.
Why should states, composed of a multi
tude of individuals, enjoy this lingular ex
emption from laws that bind the opposite
party. Is it riot the nature of a contract
that it be founded on free a/sent and on
consideration or equivalents ? Is it a con
tract reciprocally beneficial which one party
oflly is compellable to fulfil ? Is there not
a prejudice, a deception in the opinions
of men on this subjeCt ? Is not the opinion
that sovereign states are not fuaHe, a mo
narchical idea, derived to us from the
haughty sovereignties of Europe.
Is it not merely the effect of that impe
rious pride which princes feel in indepen
dant stations ? Is not this the language of
it ? " It is our royal will and pleasure that
every man in our dominions (hall submit to
our tribunals, and be compelled to render
us justiceâBut we princes will not be com
pelled. We will not fnbmit to have claims
demanded of usâOur fubjefts, however
just their claims, (hall only approach our
majesty with prayers and humble supplicati
ons ; and it (hall reft with our gracious
wills, whether to hear them or not. Com
pul/ion even in a course of law, is degrad
ing to princes." Such is the language of
the opinion which is now so popular in A
merica.
It is indeed a singular fadt that the cla
mor against fuabtlity of Jlatcs arises from
violent democrats: tho' the opinion that
states ought not to be compellable to an
fsver to the suits of individuals, is, in the
highest degree, artflocralkal or monarchi
cal. It is to give to the legislatures of
such states the mofl unbounded despotic
powers againil individuals ; powers that
extend to enable them to do rightor refufe
it at pleasure and with impunity ; powers
that are as dangerous to liberty, as the
will of theTurkilh Sultan; powers, that
even in this country, have been exercised
to the extreme opprejjion of good citizens.

Bojlon, January 11, 1794.
Gentlemen,
YOUR obliging letter of the 31ft of
Dec. last, offering to the MaflachufettÂ»
Historical Society, a room in the center
building of the Crescent, I have commu
nicated to the Society. That affociatiorf
had its origin in a sincere wish to promote
the honor and happiness of United Ame
rica, and the labor of its member# hat
been, and now is, employed with unremit
ting zeal and industry, in colle&ing and
preserving those materials, which will give
a foundation to a political, as well as a
natural history of the country. Our fel*
low-citizens recognizing the utility of oar
plan, have been very liberal and afliduous,
in yielding us afliftance and support; by
these means we have a staffed a great num
ber of books, printed productions, ancient
manuscripts, and natural curiosities.
The government of this commonwealth
has dire&ed the secretary to deliver us co
pies of public proceedings ; and we hope
that the general, and other governments
will afford us aid and countenance in the"
lame manner.
ThnÂ« situated, and with these profpefts
nothing could be more congenial to our
w i(hes, or acceptable to our interest, than
the generous offer you have made. We
derive no small degree of pleasure from the
consideration, that the donation is made
by gentlemen, whofc feelings for the pub
lic interest, and talle for arc hit eft ure, have
ornamented the capital with buildings so
exceedingly elegant as the Crescent.
1 am directed by the Society, of which
1 have the honor of being President, to
present to you their most cordial thanks
for this mark of refpeft to theiVinftituti
tion, and to assure you, that a grateful
sense of your generosity and goodness,
(hall be preserved until the Society ihall
cease to exist.
I have tlve honor to be,
Gent'emea
with sentiments of refpeft,
your most obedient
and humble servant,

prcjiofition now before the ccc'iniltee,

knowledge afforded one It rang ground of
argument, in mv mind, agair.ft the lcfo
lution. I think the maxim deferable,
tiiat no rcfolution, until its principles arc
clearly defined and its consequences well
linderltood, (hould be adopted by a legif
-1 uiv# body, especially on a commercial
fubjeft, since it is a given point, that
commerce has generally bid deriance to
! giflative intelligence, and in event,' tri
i mphed over Jegiflative reftriftions.
The difcuftiou of this fubjecf, has af
firmed an appearance, which must be fur
j ifin>( to a ft'rtngcr, and painful in the
extreme to outfelve*.
The Supreme Legislature of the Uni
ted States is' ferioully dclibt-i atinjj, not
upon the welfaVe of our citizens, but up
Â«,n the relative circumstances of two Eu
ropean nations, and this deliberation, has
not for its object, the relative benefits of
their markets', to us, but which form of
Â»<ivei iimei.t is bett, and moll like cur oVn,
which people feel the greateit affection for
US) a'i.(! what measures we can adopt,
which will bell hun.ble one, and exalt the
other
The primary motive of thfcfe resolu
tions, as acknowledged by the defenders
of them, was not the increase of our a-
j; "icultiir#, manufactures, or navigation,
but to humble Great Britain, and to build
i, * France: And although it is fa id our
ma.iufatturcs and liavii atioi', may receive
Uiivautagb, it is only mentioned, a* a iub
ftiti'.te in cafe of failure as to tie great

tun ot a tonne

the other ; the fr.iud is roirfed by such a
group of evils, ahd then called upen to
emiider a ftatcment of duties on goods
in;por:ed from foieign nations. If the
fubi: ct is commercial, why n'ottreat it up
ou the basis e;f a cotnthircial fubjeft, and
with coolnels attend to it ? If it is a ques
tion ot political hollility or war, a firm
er tone might be adopted. When a na-.
tion is opprcfTed on ail fides, by injuries
which cali loudly to be avenged, there is
an impel ioufneft i.i their cireuriiflai.ces,
which often precludes delibeilition, and
fomctimcs, at lead denies its propriety j
piemplitude of action, in the fiiil foim
that pvefents itfclf, is frequently a virtue.
But when all this national preiiuit, is to
obt lin redress, from laying a duty on a
few articles of commerce, one would hard
lv think the violent introduction, mucil
less an impkfTioned mode of debate, could
ft rik.e any man with propriety. I think
this mode of treating the fubjett tends to
confute, and contains in it no aptitude to
devclope either principle? or consequences.
After making these observations, permit

the committee merely as a commercial
one. and for a moment lay aside Indians,
Algerines, and all such initating objects.

I, fir, wat bred a farmer, I liv; a
mcng farmers, , much further removed
from a view of commerce, than any of
my colleagues, and when these resolu
tions wire brought forward, 1 expe&ed
the painful detail, that our commerce was
languilhing and our tonnage decreasing,
and that oili mercantile intereit was ear
neltly calling for the aid and prote&ion of
government. But in this expectation I
a.u agreeably disappointed ; no merchant
is complaining, nor any fact existing, to
juftiff ' :ch complaints. It is worthy of
remark, and mult induce serious enquiry,
if our trade is deranged and (hackled to
the degree pretended, why the merchants
in this home (hould t:e totally ignorant of
it i And why, to a man, they (hould be
opposed to these regulations which put
on the specious appearance, of affording
diteft relief to them ? This circumstance
alone, would go far in my mind, towards
negativing the proportions, much farther
than the clofrt (peculations of a phifo
pher in their favor, which nine times in
ten, cannot be reduced to pra&ice.
And here, Sir, I feel a confidence in
repeating, that upon a fubjeft of forcing
fade from one nation to another, which
i;. of necefiity so complicated in principle,
so various and invifiblc in consequences ;
the committee will never ad, but with
the ufmoft caution, and will constantly
keep in view, that trade will seek its own
markets, d its own level and regulate
itfelf much better than we can do ; and
although we may embarrass it, and injure
our own citizens and even other nations
for a while, it will eventually rife above
all the regulations we can make.
The gentleman who introduced these
resolves, aware of our tlourifhing (late of
commerce, has adknowleged thatby their
adoption, certain evils will be incurred.â
What are these evils ? If we allow full o
peration to his positions, without an im
mediate overture in Great Britain, there
will he a ifagnation of trade, a damp to
agi :culture, its labourers thrown out of
employment ; the present surplus ps pro
duce, rauft perish on the hands of tK'
farmer, &c. &c. But these evils, he
fays, ought to be che arfullv borne, to ob
tain, in event, a much Â£pLter good:â
Thispofition is a found one, to bear pre
sent small evils, to e(Teft future great be
nefits : But to make the reasoning com
plete, (hould not the gentleman (hew, that
the promised gaoj, is not only great e

ice of
I.tgiflatures, al
ptinsf to force
els and habits,
iiarly cautious
Are the benefits promised by these re
gulations, in any mcafure certain, or even
probable ? The great benefits promised,
are a treaty with Great Britain, a repeal
of her navigation aift, as it refpedis the
United States,and in fatt a univerfalfree
dom of trade, and if t'nefe fail, an increase
of our manufactures, and a conrfe of trade
with France, free, as they please to give
:nds, to
ci coolntfa;
I know Indians, &c. are talked of, but
I mean, these arc the promised benefits,
of a commercial kind. Are those events
so probable that we (hall be jullified, in
trying an experiment at the certain ex
pence of our prefeat tranquility anil hap
p.'nefs ? Itisfaid, our citizens are virtu
ous, this I have the pleasure to believe,
but to convince the whole mass of the
people, that a system of fclf-denial, of
any great extent in its operation, is to be
borne by them, for a future benefit, you
must hold up that benefit, in a more strik
ing and certain point of view, than can
be pretended in this cafe. They will be
(low in underltanding, that trade is to be
made free, by imposing more and greater
(hackles upon it. But if "our commercc
is flourilhing, fay the gentlemen, why
should it not be more so ? If Great Bri
tain imposes pointed restraints upon our
trade, and is exprefiing her jealousy and
hatred to us an every practicable occasion,
why not free ourselves ? What has Great
Britain done, Sir ? Has (he made a single
law, reft ricling the commerce of Inde
pendent America ! All her reftiiftions
that now a Rett us, were in exiflence while
we were her colonies, and are part of her
colonial cftabb'lhment.
Her navigation ast, is as old as 1660,
and upon ft rift examination, the United
States are more favored in her Enropean,
East and Well India ports, than any o
ther nation. It is said our trade was at
firft forced there, (jut this re Its merely on
alfertion, it is not in proof bef6re the com-
mittee.
The markets of Great Britain being
the belt, our article! of commerce and
hers being reciprocally ufeful, and, a si
milarity of languag: ajd religion, with
many other natural causes, have carried
our trade to her ports, and will keep it
there, until better markets offer, or it is
forced away. It is said the credit given
by Britilh merchants is an evil, and that
the people of Virginia owe an immense
sum in Great Britain.
When a complaint is madd in direst
terms of reftri&ions'on ourtrade,one would
not readily imagine that another complaint
would be coupled with it, that the trade
was so free as to become an injury : Be
sides credit given to an industrious provi
dent man never can be an injury ; will it
place us in a f.tuation of fear ? If we may
argue from a great state, Virginia, to the
Union, this is not true, for although that
state owes immense debts, her representa
tives come forward with great spirit, to
bring Great Britain to her feet. This
circumstance of giving credit, is entirely
a municipal regulation wholly out of reach
of Congress.
The people at the Eastward, do not
owe the English mei chants, and are very
generally opposed to these regulations.â
These facts mult convince us, that the
credits given us by the trade of Great Bri
tain, do not operate a fear and a depen
dence, which can be alarming to govern
ment.
If the municipal regulations of Virginia,
or any other state, will place the whole of
each man's property, within the reach of
his creditor, and allow the creditor legal
cocrcion for payment of debts, when vo
luntary payment is denied, there will be no
danger from foreign or domestic credit.
The (lothful and idle, as well as the fpend
thrift and wicked, will readily attribute
to faults of omiflion and commission in go
vernment, those evils, necessarily connected
with their own imprudence.
It is said by a gentleman from Pcnnfyl
vania, (Mr. Findley) that the merchants in
this city, who poifefs capitals of their
own, wi(h these reftriftione on Britifli
trade, and that the poorer fort, who are
in want of credit, and must do business by
obtaining it, are opposed to them.
If this be a fact, which is yet 'to be as
certained, it affords another argument
a'rain ft the resolutions. If capitalists,
Nabobs in trade, would wish to (hut out
of competition, men who have not capi
tals, whose induflry, and knowledge of
bufinef6, if they can at firft obtain credit,
would promise them a living, and ufeful
nefs to community, whence i 6 this wi(h de
rived ? From nothing but a desire to ef
fcÂ£t a monopoly of trade to thtmfelres,
the confequcnce of which would be a pro
fit of 25 or 50 per cent, and those men
who have not capitals, must serve them as
clerks or quit the country.
Liberty aud equality is not the fore
moll feature in this desire of our rich mer
chants, if the desire exists; and such a doc
trine favors more of Aristocracy and less of
Republicantfm than I expected to hear from
that honorable member.
(To be Continued.)

A Dialogue let-wi'.-n Willy Frank and
Faithful Columbus, tiuo Farmers.
Willy. MY dear Sir, I have come a
long journey, to have a conference with
vju with refpefi to the management of
the Fanr.Vef which we have the care.
Faithful'. Sir, I thank you, any advice
you can give me and my Family in the
management of ours (hall be gratefully
received, and improved in the bed manner
we are capable : And you may atTure your
felf of my reciprocal advice for the bene
fit o r yours.
Willy. 1 thank you, brother Farmer.
I expected nothing less from so good a
friend, and his good Family : And though
I am personally a perfect (hanger, yet
confider-ng our Family Connexions, and
the kindnefies your family in time past
have received from mine, I am confident
of fjitallc returns. And now, fir, with a
freedom and franknefs without difgmfe, I
will ln'orm you what those returns are
You must manage your Fann just as we
manage ours ;oras we ftia 1 1 judge most
for our benefit, so that the Fruit of your
Labor, and the Produce of your Fields,
and all your family improvements upon
your Farm, may be turned by us to the
advantage of our Farm. And if your
connections and engagements with any of
your neighboring farmers, or any other
farmers, far or near, interfere with this,
you have only to break them off all at
once, and immediately to conform to us ;
and then we Ihall go 011 lovingly and swim-
rningly.
Faithful. The love and frier,dfhip of
our family for yours is most sincere, and
for any obligations you may have laid us
under, you may allure yourfelvcs of all
leafonable and proper returns. But that
our Farm (hall be managed ns you are
pleased to manage yours, and the interest
of it appropriated to answer your views.
Jolely, is what our moral and political du
ties, and our true ioterelt, and give me
leave to add, your duties and interest too,
will not admit. The inftru&ions we have
received in our family and the principles
in which we are educated, teach us, that
the ir.tereft of all other Farmers is as dear
to them as ours is to us, and that we are
under sacred obligations to deal justly and
equitably with all with whom we have any
connection or commerce. To those from
whom we receive kindnefles, we feel our
selves under peculiar obligations, and en
deavor to make suitable Returns. We in
terfere, unaiked, in the intern: 1 affairs of
none, and take no part in their domestic
family Disputes and Quarrels. And while
by your dciire, we are ready to give you
our best advice, and every afiiftance that
propriety dictates to improve your own
ajfairt, you must give us leave to take care
of our own, without your too officious
interference, and to be humane and just
to other Farmers as well as to you.
Willy. Have I come io far then in all
the warmth of zeal and flames of enthusi
asm to meet with such a cold reception ?
to have no encomiums laviftied upon me
and mine, for our late improvements, and
for our profeCed skill and delign to teach
all other farmers-how to improve. Know
then, fir, I came not hither, to be inftrudl
ed, but to inftruil you and yours ; and,
if necessary, and if poiTible, by force to
ob'igc you to confirm to our-fentiments
and pra&ices as you value our fnendfhip
with which your hnppinefs, and very ex
igence is so clofelv connected, and not ob
ly yours but that of toute le Monde.
Faithful. Be calm, my friend, I fear
all your sentiments are not just ; and that
your zeal and warmth carry you too far,
and even to such lengths, as would not be
conlidcred by the moil intelligent and ju
dicious part of your own family, to be for
their benefit. Our family always consult
together in such cafcs, and after calmly
giving and receiving all neceflary infor
mation, with deliberation and harmony
proceed according to the opinion of the
majority, and as is thought to be for the
beil good of the whole,
b'Uly. Then, Sir, I infill that you call
your family, immediately together, and take
their fentimcr.ts : for, from my own feel
ings, and designs, and from converting
with foine of them, I am confident that
they will be of my opinion rather than
yours.
Faithful. You mull give me leave to
differ from yon in sentiment. The family
have been well bro't up : They have form
ed fte*dy habits: They have their dated
times of meeting to consult upon family
affairs : One of these times is now near
approaching : They are now busily em
ployed in their own more private concerns ;
a present interruption to them. I am per
suaded would be disagreeable to them,
and be, by them as it iÂ» by me, (such ia
the mutual affection and confidence fub
filting in the family) looked upon impro
per and unreasonable.
Besides, I am free to tell you, that if
we (hould comply with your motions, 1
think we should give just occasion for um
brage and complaint to some very sub
stantial Farmers, with whom we have con
nections, and would wiih to maintain, a
friendly intercom fe.
Willy. Humph ! I fee you have a re
gard to old ych:> Bull, and Don Philip,
and fan Mynheer, and are unwilling to
facrifice your fooliih expectations from
them.
Faithful. Moral obligations are indeed
sacred with us : They support our politi
cal engagements, & may not be dispensed
with. If others stain their charadtar by
infringing them, we would not stain ours
by atting like them. We will pursue just
and laudable measures in seeking redress
for injuries, and such measures, with the
blessing of Heaven, we are confident will
always be e(FeÂ£lual.
Pray, Sir, be calm and reason, and your
own good sense will incline you to the
fame opinion, and you will reft fatisfied
with our conduit and proceedings.
Willy. Be calm and reafen ! My blood
and Gizzard! How I feel! and what
fools arc all they who do not feel as I do !
Be calm and reason, forfooth ! mind mo
ra! principles ! Ay, perhaps religion too,
and the religion of the Bible, that anti
quated, exploded book, a book that re
quires us to regard a divine Providence
and power ! What deity is there but Li
berty? And what tsLiherty,but todo as I
pleaie, arid to have all mankind to con
form to my plcafure, and do as I would
have them ? I acknowledge no other Dei
ty : I worship no other God.
Faithful. But 1 have always acknow
ledged the one only living and true God:
The whole Family have been taught to
do so. We regard his Providence and
word. Hi. divine help we have experi
enced in remarkable instances. Our no
tions of liberty are different from your's.
In the management of our affairs we de
pend upon his divine direction and bles
sing, and in this dependence, while we
endeavour to do our duty, we have no
thing anxiously to fear.
Should we conform to your notions we
mud deviate from this course : Therefore
you ought not, and mutt not expect it.
Willy. Look you then fir, if this be
your determination, and I cannot excite
an opposition in your own family, too
strong for you, which I (hall fitft attempt
âI will cover myfelf with my frize coat,
and with (hrtigging (houlders and a ghast
ly grinâwish you all to the Devil.

The dispatches, of which the following

were yesterday received at the office of
the Right Hon. Henry Dundas, his
Majesty's principal secretary of state,
for the home department.
La Malgne, Oct. 16.
My Lord,
I have the honor to inform your Lord
ship, that in consequence of the enemy's
having repeatedly appeared on the impor
tant hill of Cape Bran, which oveilooks
this fort, and commands a great part of
the harbour, I ordered 100 men of Huif
teins, or battalion of Royal Louis, to be
polled there, and on the 14th, repaired
there with the engineers, to prepare for
its defence ; and after they had marked
out the situation of an intended work, I
sent a reinforcement of 100 of the regt.
of Royal Louis. On the 15th, before
day, the report of mufquetry was heard,
which increased with the light, and in
duced me to order 100 of the 30th. rcgt.
100 Neapolitans, 50 Spaniards, and the
remainder of the Royal Louis, to follow
me there. By the time I got to the bot
tom of the hill the fire was become very
briik, and i had some difficulty to get up
by the road. The troops from La Mal
gne were nearly up, by a (hort road thro'
vineyards. I detached Capt. Torriano of
the 30th to go round left of the hill, and
take the enemy on their right flank ; this
had the dcfired effect, and they gave
way
On the top of the hill, I found the
iloyal Louis defending thcmfelves gallant
ly, although hard pressed, but the out
pods beingdriven in and the men in want of
cartridges. I advanced with the frefh
troops, and recovered our out posts, after
an obstinate resistance, and placed Capt.
Tomlinfon, of the 30th regiment, in the
advance, the Neapolitan regiment in the
center, Capt. Torriano on the left, with
Royal Louis and the Spanilh troops on
the right: and it was near an hour before
the enemy retired. They were supported
by cannonâwe had none. I had previ
ously sent an aid-de-camp to La Malgne
for cartridges,and toToulon for a support
of troops. The enemy, notwithstanding
they were greater in force than I expected,
did not seem disposed to renew the attack ;
insomuch, that 1 ordered the workmen to
begin the redoubt, visited the posts, and
then returned to the fort for the purpose
of hurrying up guns, ammunition, provi
sions, &c. and repeating my request of
men from Toulon. In half an hour after
I had left Cape Brun, the whole army of
the enemy had advanced under cover of
woods, and supported by artillery, attack
ed the port on all fides, and carried it in
consequence of numbers, notwithstanding
a most diflinguifhed resistance. lam fqr
ry to inform, that in both affairs, many
officers and brave men fell. In the person
of Captain Torriano his majtfty loft one
of the most refpe&able officers in Europe.
Were I to enter upon the condufl of the
officers and men, I should fail in doing jus
tice to their merit. The 30th .regiment
did all that men could do; and the bat
talion of Royal Louis, although only a
few davs formed, fought with determined
valor. The fortunate recovery ot the post
was so immediately under your Lordlhip's
eye, that it is unneceflary for me to add
more, than that I have the honor to be,

the natural history of the Torrid Zone, ebfer

VOLUME X. OF
Encyclopedia; or Dictionary
Of Arts, Sciences, and Miscellaneous
Literature, on a Plan entirely new j
sr WHICH
The Different Sciences and Arts,
are digefied into the form of
Diftinft Treaties or Svftems:
THIS volume contains principles of Levels,
Liberty, Doctrine of Light, Lightning,
Locks, Logarithms, Logic, Hittory of Lon
don, Longirude, Luther, Lydia, Macerlon,
Madagascar, Magic, Magnetism, Malts, Hil
tory of Man, Marriage, Mary, Maryland,
Masonry, Materia Medica, Meadow, Mecha
nics, with a great variety of Biographical *nd
Miscellaneous articles, illullrated with Twln
ty Two Copperplates.
As a number ol families *re still in the
country, and it is rot generally known who
areieturned. T. Dobfon, solicits the favor
of the subscribers to call or fend for their vo
lumes, that they may be supplied as early as
polTible.
The TENTH VOLUME of the Encyclopedia is
now presented to the public; but at it makes
its appearance in an imperfect state, loine ac
count of the reason of thatimpeifeaion (huuld
be [>iven. On the Bth of September lafl, the
Publiftier had the misfortune of having his
Printing Office burnt down by a fire which
broke out in the neighbourhood, and a great
quantity of hi? printing materials destroyed,
and among other articles, the riauÂ»ES, with
which he was printing the tablss or ka
garithms, belonging to the present volume,
were melted down by the violence ol" the tire.
As a supply of thel'c conld not be immediately
obtained, he was under the necessity of pub
lilhing the volume without thele tables; but
hopes he (hall (>e able to puhlifh them with the
next volume which is now in confidcrablc fur-
wardnefs.
The Publisher embraces this opportunity of
exprefling his grateful acknowledgments to
the generous public, for the very literal pa
tronage with which his undertaking has been
honored; at the fame time he takes the li
berty of representing to such of the fubferibers
as are in arrears, the indifpenfible necessity of
punctuality, both in taking up ihe volumes as
early as poflible after publication, and of pay
ing for them when taken. Many of the fub
feribers having got only one, two, three, &rc.
volumes, and several volumes remain unpaid.
Thus the work hangs in all its different stages
from the commencement; and though the im
portance of a few dollars may be but a trifle
to tne individuals, yet the accumulation of
these trifles unpaid lays the Publisher under
very serious embarraifmetit, and deprives hiui
of the use of many Thousands of Dollars whicfc
at this time would be of very eifcntial fervictr.
For tliefe reasons the Publisher finds himfejf
under the necessity of recurring to the original
terms of publication, and in future no vo
lumes will be delivered but only to those who
take and pay to the time of publication.
