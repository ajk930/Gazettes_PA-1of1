OBS E R V A 7 lON S
RIVER POTOMACK,
THK CovKwr Jldjmcmut, AND THK
CITY OF WASHINGTON.
(Continued from our hi/l.)
THE number of inhabitants living in
the several counties of Virginia and Ma
ryland, bordering upon the Potomack or
its branches, amount to upwards of three
hundred thousand, according to the cen
sus taken by order of the gerteral govern
ment, in the year 1791, They art all,
or so nearly so, that not one fiftieth part
can_be excepted, cultivators of the foil.â
easy to conceive, that they
to the (hipping ports on IM" nWJ. t>jrr,
ft ill so eKtenfive is the country thro' which
3 4 5
the Potomack and its branches pass, that
it is yet but thinly fettled ; its inhabitants
are, however, very rapidly multiplying,
as well by emigration as by the natural
course of population.
The productions of the country consist
of wheat, tobacco, Indian corn or maize,
rye, oats, potatoes, beans, peas, and in
Ihort, of every ai tide that the licll farm
ing lands are capable of producing. Hemp
rid flax are cultivated here, and yield large
quantities. '1 he land is rich in pailuragc
molt parts of it admirably adapted to
sheep ; and a heavy growth of timber, fit
for (hip-building, as" well as every other
purpose, is found here. There i 3, near
Cumberland, and within 10 or ?2 miles
of the river, a tract of country that a
bounds with very large white pine trees,
suitable for mills of (hips ; fomfe of thele
trees are from 5 to 6 feet in diameter, and
run up 100 feet without a branch.
Slate, marble, frec-ftone of the red and
grey Portland kind,and iron oie,are found
in abundance on the banks of the river.
Several large iron works are already esta
blished, which furnifh bar-iron and cafl
ings of an excellent quality. I/tmeftone
abounds every where. Of coal too, there
is an inexhaustible quantity, near Cumbei
land, laying on the banks of the river, &
in other parts at no great distance from it;
from whence in future, not only all the
towns and manufactories on the river may
be supplied, bat it may become a capital
article of exportation.
There is in the river a great plenty of
very fine filh. Large quantities of shad
and herrings are annnally taken here and
expoi ted to the Weft Indies-
From the preceding observations, it is
eafv to conceive that the commerce of
this river cannot be inconfiderabk : And
a iingle view of the frtuation upon which
the city of Wafliington is laid out, points
out that spot as the moll eligible on the
river, for a large commercial town.
The city of Washington lays in latitude
53'. âIt is situated on the east fide
of* the Potomack, about four miles below

the Head of tide'w ater, and extends dtxy n

wlncfi it formed bv the junction of th.
eastern branch with the Potomac!; ; li
then runs along the eastern branch for
more tban two milrt.âlts gcficra!" width
is about otie mile and three quarters.
f"he eastern branch affords one i>f the
fiirfit harbor* imaginable for ftips. It is
more than a mile wide at its tnouth, and
holds nearly the fame width fh- almost the
whole distance to which the city extends
upon it; it then narrows gradually to its
head, which is about ten miles from its
conflux with the Potumack.
nel of this branch lays cn the fide next the
city ; it has in al} parts of it, as far as the
c;ty extends, from twenty to twenty-five
feet of water. Above the city, it is only
navigable for small craft. The channel is
generally so near the city, that a whaif,
extended forty, or fifty feet from the bank,
will have water f*norigh for the largcfl fhijis
to come up and discharge or receivc their
cargoes. The hud on each fide o r die
branch is fufficiently high to secure (hip
ping from any wind tiiat blows ; and one
very important advantage which this
branch has, as a harbor, overall extensive
rivers which freeze and are liable to be
broken up fudd-rnly by frcfhfs or land
floods, is, that on account of the fliort
dillance to which it extends into the land,
no rapidity of current is ever occafionec!
by frefhes ; and, ye!THj in the main
river, if they {huuld happen to be caught
there by the ice, pre liable to receive great
injury, and are forhetifces totally loft by
it, those in the branch lay in perfciS fe
curity.âlt has also the advantage of being
open some days later in the winter r.nd
earlier in the spring than the main river at
Oeorge-Town, and the upper parts of
the city. The river generally (huts upa

closed so as to prevent the navigation: dur- <

The nmn channel of tue Potomack op
posite the city, running near the Virginia
shore, that part of the city which lavs up
on the Potomack has only a ftnall channel,
carrying from eight to twelve feet of wa
ter, until you come within about three
quarters of a mile of George-Town, when
the channel turning between Mafon's-Ifland'
and the city, gives a depth of water fromt *
twenty to thirty feet close in with the
shore of the city. This renders the water
lots within that small space very valuable ;
for any (hips that come up the river may
here lay within twenty yards of the city,
and the boasts which bring t'nÂ« produce of
the country down the river, may at all
times come her*, deep loaded as they corns
down ; whereas they could not go, thus
loaded, down to the ealtern branch, unlefi
in very smooth weather.
Before a particular defcriptiop. of the
spot, &c. on which the city of Wafliing

improper to note the conftiti-.tiorial and
legal Ground upon which the location of
the city is made.

Tuesday, December 31.
Mil- Forreft. brought Jn a report on the
fubjeft of tliat part of the Governor's
communication, which relates to the o
pening roads in the diftridl of Southwark,
of Meyamenfing Towrifhip, with a reso
lution that a bill (hould be pailed.
Mr. Morgan reported' a bill from the
committee on the fubjedt of enlarging the
Jibrary of the commonwealth, which was
read the firft time and ordered that it be
taken up for a zd reading this day week.
Mr. Evans reported 011 the fubjeft of
intestate Eftgtes. â¢
Whereas by the Gxifting laws of this
commonwealth for fettling intestate's es
tates, the diftrihution thereof is unequal
and unjust, and made upon principles in
compatible with the spirit of the constitu
tion of this ftateâtherefore
Refolyed, That a committee be appoint
ed to bring in a bill for amending the laws
of thia state relative to the fettling and
making distribution of intestate's estates,
so that the estate of any person within
this commonwealth, dying intestate, leav
ing lawful iflue, shall be equally divided a
mong such issue ; reserving to the widow
her full right of dower, according, to the
existing laws of this commonwealth. And
that the real estate of any person who is
arrived at the age of twenty-one years, and
(hall die intestate, Ã¼Ãmarried and without
issue, (hall be equally divided between the
surviving brothers Â»nd filters, or their re
preventatives. And that the personal ef
tate of afty perlon of, the Utter dekriptl
on, who leaves no. parents, ftallbe equally
divided between the fyrviving bp-others and
fitters, or their reprefcntatives
The report of a committee made yes
terday refpe&ing amendments to the con
stitution of the United States, was read a
2d time and made the order for next
Thursday week.
Mr. M organ called up" the petition of
a chamber contiguous to the Statt-Houfe
for a law library, it was read and ordered
to lie on-the table.
The house next proceeded to the order
<f[ the day, viz. the report of a cofrirtni
tee on the petition of Archibald Magrcvv,
praying that he may be enabled to fell the
estate of Thomas Bracken deceased, said
Magrew being the only fhrviving executor.
The report of the committee was in favor
of the petition, and recommends a law
may be pafled agreeably thereto.
The question being Hated by the Speak
er, " will the house agree to the report ?"
a debate ensued, and Mr. Kelly moved to
commit it to a special committee of three
members, to prepare and report a bill, pro
vided they (hall, upon due enquiry, judge
it necefiary.
It is stated by the petitioner, that he
is surviving executor of the last will and
testament of Thomas Bracken, late of the
county of York, deceased, who died pos
sessed of a tract of land of 130 acres, situ
ate in Manallen toWnship, in the said coun
ty, and by his said will devised the lame tof
his widow during the term of her natural
life ; and after his decease, authorises his
executors to fell and convey the said tract
of land, and to apply the monies arising
therefrom, to the uses in the said will ex
prelied ; and Hating, that one of the ex
ecutors in the said will named, is ftnee
deceased, and doubts having arisen- whe
ther, the petitioner is enabled in law to
make a good title to the purchases, -with
out the aid of the legislature ; therefaVe
praying that an ast may be pafled to ena
ble the petitioner to fell.
Mr. Swanwick moved a pollponment of
Mr. Kelly's motion for the purpose of
considering a substitute which he proposed,
viz. that a committee of three be appojjttv
ed to confuk with the attorney-general,
and provided he judges it proper and eflen
tial that the legislature ihould pass a law
in J&jwr Ql the petitioner, theo.-lte.gJy.
This motion was opposed by Mr. Kellr,
who did not think it confident with thfc
dig n 'ty of the houfc that they (houtd en
tirely depend upon the opinion of any one*
person, without exercising their own judg
ments. He stated some items of the will, j
of sums being left to sundry persons, which
were to be paid out of the faleof the lands,
but that the surviving executor was pre
vented from paying those.legacies until the
said lands could be fold, and that therefore
a law might be pafiedto enable him to fell,
not vvithftanding the general objection, that
all the executors of a will mull iojn in a
sale, &c.
_ Mr. Evans was in favor of Mr. Swan
wiek's motion. Mr. Morgan propoftd a
nother fubftitutc which came nearly up to
the idea of that offered by Mr.
This was to add two members to the com
mittee, who would be appointed to pre
pare a bill, and that they (hould be in
ftru&ed to consult the attorney-general,
( not to be altogether tied down to his opi
nion) and to report the bill if they judge
it proper.
Mr. Stokely quoted a law which autho
rizes a jury to explain the intention of a
testator in cases of difficulty, without trou
bling the legislature.
Mr. M'Lene seconded Mr. Morgan's
motion, which was adopted, and a com
mittee appointed.

I PUBLIC curiosity must be in no small
degree interested about a pamphlet which
Mr. Burke has declared to be " one of
the mod able and rascally produ&ions
that ever appeared." There are only two
copies of it in England, and having pro
cured a reading of ope, we fubjom such
extra&s a* the Ihort time allowed for a
hasty perusal would permit us to make. It
appeared on the 23d of May, eight days
before the final defeat of the Giroadift
party of whom it may be <<oafidered as ths
concluding inaiiifctlo. it is writtÂ«%wt!i
great fofrce of reason and eloquence. Its
ohjeft is to prove,that all the misfortunes
of the Republic are to be aicribed to the
anarchic faction at Paris.
He begin* with an avowal of some im
portance to the future historians of the re
volution.
" The whole truth, fays he, has ne
ver been spoken at any time since the com
mencement of the revolution ; we were
afraid by expressing it of injuring and dis
honouring the caule of liberty, of discou
raging the people, and of impeding the
progress of public bufmefi. This circum
fpedtion is right and Â£ven necessary. when
nations are to be saved by individuals or
bodies of men ; but it is deftruftive when
the nation alone can save herfelf. To dis
semble her situation, is to prolong her le
thargy, no great popular efforts can be
produced or well directed without inform*
ing the people of their situation Such
is our position, and such are the motives
which induce me to tear asunder the veil
that hides from us the source of our mif
fortunes."
He proceeds to establish three pofitiotis.
" i it. That the party of anarchists has
governed and does govern all the delibera
tions of the Convention, and all the ope
rations of the Executive Council.
" 2d. That that party has been and is
Hill the sole cause of all the evils, internal
and external, which afflict France.
" 3d. That the Republic cannot be
saved, without a rigorous measure which
shall refcuethe representatives of the peo
ple from the despotism of the faction."
He afterwards presents us with a des
cription of anarchy, contrasted with the
creed of the genuine republicans.
" I believe, fays he, that the people
will now regret the lethargic tranquillity
of its ancient servitude, if we do'not pro
cure it a republican tranquillity ; because
the people desire to be happy ; because
they mud desire it Hill more after such
great and continued facrifices ; becaule
their happiness doe* not consist in the eter
nal repetition of violent convulfiohs ; be
cause if ruffians live by sedition, the peo
ple live by repose. I believe that the ef
tablilhment of order is a truly revolution
ary measure ; because it strengthens the
revolution within ; because it furnilhes re
sources against our enemies without; and
rope. I believe this do&rine as salutary
to the non-proprietor as the proprietor, be
cause he can only subsist by constant labor
and there can be no cpnftaat labour for
the poor where there is no constant feeuri
ty for the lives and properties of the rich.
I believe that this doctrine of eternal in-
furred ion, #ill produce pillage and maf
kcre, which must difgull & fatigue the na
tion a* to a republican form of government
â¢âSuch are the opinions of thofc coura
geous patriots, who have been devoted to
ignominy, and to the daggers of aflaflins, ~
by the names of Girondins, Rplandins,
Briflotins, &c." '
The majority of the Convention, are,
according to him, pure and uncorrupt, but
feeble and domineered over by a handful
-of an archills, who rule by terror. If they
unanimously agree to protest their inde
pendence by a departmental guard, if they
decree the punirtiment of death against the
instigators of murder, if they hear accu
sations against Roberfpierre, and order tlie
prosecution of the aflaflins of September,
they are speedily forced by the clamou-s
and the menaces of anarchists to revoke
all these salutary meafurea. Barrere, Le
and Danton, had all privately
declared their opinion for the appeal to
the people, in the cafe of the King. Dan
ton had repeatedly said.that theimprifon
ment of Louis was the only measure dic
tated by justice and policy ; and these very
men now direst the vengeance of the po
pulace against the Girondists for fupport
fng what they themselves had contended
fpr.
The following confeflion it so remarka
ble that we must recommend it to the no
tice of our readers :
â¢ One word composes the greater part
of the history of the three afTemblies, and
that word is fear !'
A very able account follow* of the ad
drefa with which the anarchists governed
the neutral and independent party in the
Convention, sometimes by the terror of
their mobs, and sometimes by inspiring
them with jealousy of the Girondists. To
those who refufed to petition for the ex
pulsion of that party, the commune of
Pans refufed certificates of patriotism,
w hicti in the then- cifcutnAani.es, wev* <
fafCgudrds of life, By such means -was
prepared that revolution i)f the 31ft of
May, which Brftfot fecms clearly to have
forefsen, and which he justly compare* to
Col. Pride's Purge.
" A dreadful picture is prefenttfd of the
revolutionary tribunal, in which'a body of â¢
men, whom in defiance of common feofc
they called a jury (though it be perma
nent, and the accused has no right to chal
lenge,) deliver their fufFrages openly, un
der the. menaces of galleries filled with
hired ruffians.
" A tribunal, adapted indeed to make
us regret monarchy and her baftiles. A
tribunal in which two directors of the iflaC
{acres of the 2d of September, fit as judg
es J !_The triumphal acquittal of Marat,
does it not -prove that the Convention and
the tribunals are the instruments of afFafc
fins. That wretch, whose foul is made up

The defpotifro Â©f this anarchic fa&ion
was not less conspicuous over the Miniflero
than over the Convention- It appeared
in the horrible perfection of the virtuous
Roland ; it appeared in the tame and pu
sillanimous submission of Garat to men
whom he must detest ; 'it appeared in the
impunity with which Pache plundered the
treafureg and disorganized the armies, with
no other protection than his Jacobinism;
it appeared in the prote&ion given by the
fame faction to Monge* coavi&ed of the
moll scandalous incapacity and negligence
in the adminiftratign of the marine.
To the fame execrable faction ought in -
some raeSfure to be ascribed the defedion
of Dumourier. :
" I know," fays BrifTot, " his ambi*
.tion, his immorality, and his indifference
for liberty. Hq never ftneerely wished: a
Republic. He desired a mofrarchy-tem.
pered by democratic forms. That form
of srQvernment. hut .suits men whn join
great talents to violent pafifons. But I
will venture to fay that the calumny which
pursued cvei) the triumphs of Dumourier,
has precipitated his treachery, and by con
sequence our misfortunes."
The fame finftion has exercised itÂ« des
potism over the departments by those exe
crable commissaries with which they have
deluged France.
: " Leonard Bourdon, one of them, pro
duces a tumult at Orleans, which until hit
arrival had, during the whole revolution,
been tranquil.
" He fills the prifom of that unfortu
nate city with his viÂ£Hmt, and when the
wives and children of the prisoners come to
him to expostulate, he compel* them at
the point of the bayonet, to dance and
drink, as if displaying lavage triumph, at
the miseries of their huftmnds and fetberx
A few are provoked to give this Bourdon
a drubbing. This if called the affaffins
tion of a deputy, and they have expiated
their offence on the fcaffold."
To the fame faction he ascribes the war
with Spain, England and Holland.
" Hofliiities with Austria were inevi
table; insult and injury had been too long
and too tamely endured from that power.
She meditated attack, and only waited a
favorable moment. It was the policy of
France not to permit her to chufe her own
time of attack, and France declared war.
" But the war with the maritime pow
ers may be ascribed to three causes : The
decree of fraternity of the 19th of Nov.
extorted from the Convention by the cla
mours of the anarchists ; the ufclefs and;
impolitic death of Louis, which afforded
to the. mi'uiftcrÂ» cf. thqfe cyuutriei the
means of fanaticizing the people against
Fi-ance â¢, and the general horror against
the unpunished massacres of September.
" Of the lafi,Thomas Paine, in a work
about to be published, speaks thus ; " I
was in England at the massacres of Sep
tember. Before that fatal event the prin
ciples of the French Revolution had made
rapid progress; scarce had the news of
those massacres arrived, when a general
cnangc took place in the public mind
all the friends of France mourned ; ther
lhunned each other ; they dreaded the
melancholy of each other's afpeft; theyJhrurik from the' iafolent triumph oÂ£ their
enemies, and from the exultation of arif
tocrgcy, difgiljfed by a maik of lamenta
tion and horror. Thus did all the princi
ples and'all the friends of the revolution
fuffei: from the wickedness of a' few indi
viduals. In vain was it fald that those
who fiiffered were guilty ;âit was an
fwertd that a prison was as sacred as an
altar, and that he who could violate a pri
son, is capable of betraying his country."
Thus far Thomas Paine.'
It was not enough for them, however,
thus to second the views of Pitt, and to
furjlifh him with the rrteans of alarming
and maddening the people of England .in
to a war. They mud do the fame service
to the Stadtholdtr, and to the aristocracy
of .iiollatird.
!' Cambon said to Abbem, (the Dutch
banker* a patriotic refugee at Paris) "You
have no church laiifk to c'onfifeate in Hol
land las w'e found in Flinders âwhen we
get to" Afflfterdam we must make a revo
lution of Portfolios!" Mull not such
language teach Holland, and was it not
wotth the Stadtholder an army ?
jThe war which their abfurditics and
crimÂ«s provoked his is it 3 conchiift beer,
every- where pÂ«tkied by their incapacity,
and the diftraftions which they have crra
ted.'
P A defencclefs frontier and a â dilcon
tented people seemed to invite the inv.inon
of Spain ; her opulent and unarmed co
lonies prefented-an easy prey to our marine
âto Lo.iifiana which had been fold to the
SpaoKb eemrr-ivc ieemed tw ow conquest
as a- repartition ; -the Dutch colonies in In -
dia might-have been enabled to* throw off
the yoke of Holland; and on the Conti
nent, a powerful Prince, the MithridatCs
of India, vanquifted but not destroyed,
animatcdwith an implacable animosity to
the English name, needed only the ap
pearance of a French force, again to take
up'arms against the objects of his heredi
tary detestation.
" In Europe too there are circumstan
ces, of which statesmen of a daring and
comprchenfive genius might have improv
ed. The obstinate ignorance of jacobinism,
ruined against the rock of Sardinia, that
fleet under Truguet, which, if it had
appeared in tlie Archipelago, would have
emboldened the Porte again to arm against
Ruflia; to support Poland; to attempt
the re-c*ptare of the Crimea ; and would
thus have lighted a flame in the east of
Europe which all the efforts of our ene
mies would have been, scarce able to extin-
guifh.
" The Weft-India colonies of our ene
mies Would have been fnfficiently annoyed
by an improvement in the internal regimen
of our own islands."
This alludes, we presume, to the scheme
for emancipating and arrfling their (laves,
which wis-agitated about nine months ago.
" Sometime ago Bueot proposed a law,
that every deputy should give an account
of his fortune, and of the additions which
he had made to it during the constituent
Affe-mbly, the Legislative AfTembly, and
the Convention. Had such a law been
pafied, when it came to my turn I mud
have anfwe're^ ânothing. It is thus that
I would refute'the calumniator who called
me the ally of Pift.âAn incorruptible
character, evidenced by this honorable po
verty?, is the only patrimony I (hall be
queath to my children. This proposition
of Buzot yas, however, evaded by the
Anarchils ; and indeed, such an enquiry
would have proved embarrafiing to them.
Fibre A'Eglantine, in tlie lowest state of
indigence before the maflacres of Septem
ber, how came he to acquire a larded es
tate of 12/300 livres a year, and how does
he support his hotel, his carriage and his
fervanta are the sudden for
tunes of Panis, of Sergent, and of so many
others of the afiafiinating commune of Pa
ris ? How (hall we account for the large
estates lately purchased in the name of the
father-ii.-law of Danton ?"
He concludes in these words,
Â« Anarchlfts, robbers, you may now
strikeâl have done my duty, I have spok
en truths ufeful to my country, and they
will survive me!"

For the Gjzmtts of the United States,
Mr. Fenno,
Be pleased t6' republifh the following
very fmgular paragraph taken from your
paper of the 31ft of December, 1793,
with the accompanying remarks.
" A letter published in a morning pa
per from a member of Congrcfs, to some
merchant in Peterfburgh, Virginia, men
tions the agency of Great Britain in mak
ing the truce between Portugal and Al
giers. It is but justice to declare, that
fubfequeut information has been received
from higher authority than the one alluded
to, declaring that the truce was made
without the intervention of that nation,
&by the agency of a person who has had no
initru&ions from that power for a consider
able period, and whose appointment has
long been fuperceded."
The origin, design and tendency of this
qprnmunication being too obvious to i>o
miftahen, the writer of the letter feels
himfelf conltrained to observe, tlv? it
would It more than jiifticf to Great Britain',
and lefrlban jvftke to the United States,
to declare, thai subsequent information â¢' has
been received from higher authority, than
the one alluded to, declaring that the truce
I was made without the intervention cfthat
hation, and by HU -agency 6? a person,
who had no inftruftio.-is from that power
for a confi4erab}e-time> arid wfiofe appoint
ment lists long since been fuperceded."
Because he conceives fucli a declaration
'would bfc palpably untrue. T*he fubjequent
infarpiation, that is, the iirfdrmation bf the
latest dates, from the riioft authentic and
iliredV channel, confirifrs the -intelligenct
given in the letter to the merchants of
Peterftmrgh, and suggests further-, that
Qreat Britalh is the gukrantee for the due
perfortnaace of the truce, and had exerted
herfelf in Portugal to prevent that nation
from furnilhing a convoy to the defcnce
lass Apt'tican vefiels in her ports.
ft is iiicomprehenfible, that Great Bri
taia (hould- guarantee the tnice, without
foa* agency in making it, or at le'all with-,
out having an agent oh the spot to an
twcrfor the guarantee.

The rtMTH TOLUK* of the Encyclopedia'.ii
now prefentfcd to the public; but as it makes
its appearance in an imperfect state, some ac
count of the reason of that iinperfe&ion should
be given. On the Bth of September last, tlie
Publi(her had the misfortune of having his
Printing-office burnt down by a fire which
broke out in the neighbourhood, and a great
quantity of his printing materials destroyed,
and among other articles, the figuiej, with
which he was printing the TaÂ»lis or lo
garithms, belonging to the present volume,
were melted down by th# violence nf Hi* firr.
As a supply of these could uot be immediately
obtained, he was under tlie necefllty of pub
lifliing the volume without tlie'e TAsits; but
Itopes he ftiall Ik able to publish them with the
next volume which is nÂ»w in conirrterable for
wardnel's.
The Pithlifher embraces this opportunity of
exprefiing his grateful acknowledgments to
thÂ® generous public, lor the very liberal pa
rronage with which his undertaking has been
honored; at the fame time he takes the li
berty of representing to foch of the fubfci iben
as are in arrears, the indiipenfiblf neceffi-y of
punctuality, both in taking up tl,g \olumes as
early as pollible after publicatibn, aiid of pay
ing for them when taken. Many of the ftth
fcribers having got only one, two, th; ee, &c.
volumes, and leveral volumes remainvKPnip.
Thus the work hangs in all its different ftagc*
from the commencement; and though the im
portance nf a few dollars may be but a trifle
to the individuals, yet the accumulation of
these trifles vwmd lays thÂ« Publiflier ttndet
very serious finbarrafimeor, Â«hd deprives bint
of the ule of many ThoKlandsof Dollars which
at this time would be of very efleotial service.
For these realoiis the Publllhtr finds hitnfetf
under the necessity of recurring to the or! jitial
