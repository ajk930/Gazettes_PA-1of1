PHILADELPHIA, Feb. 25.
From a Corrcfpondtni.
Our anarchy men, pretend that they
would have the People strong and the Go
vernment weak. They are against the
Government, that n clear. They are a
gaiaft the People, that is equally clear.
Witness, their fchiemes the summer past.
They tried their utmost to counteract the
President's wife measures. A feeble go
vernment, or a feeble spirited man would
have been borne down and swept into hos
tile measures. Tufcany and Genoa, shew
this truth by their example. Poland has
ever been played upon in like manner. The
crazy mifrulc of Clubs would make this
Country the prize or more properly the
sire-ship of foreign incendiaries. We owe
our peace to the energy of our magistra
cy.
A federal government fays a correfpen
dent, in the General Advertiser, would
ruin France, because the royal faction
would throw tHemselves into one or more
of the federate republics, and thereby
the whole would Gnk under its enemies.
Mr. Genet's game of bringing a state into
play against the Union, looks federsl.
The tendency and the design were plain,
yet our faction juftified the ast and the a
geot, and that paper is devoted somewhat
remarkably to the vindication of the of
fender. Men have loft their lives in France
for only Mating what was done here. It
is proper to mtrk this circumstance, as it
mark* men.

MUNICIPALITY, Mi, iÂ«-
The National Coraniiiltoners at 1 .yon*, Fow

destroyed by undermining or by fire, (hall be
immediately marked out Far deftru&ion.
id, That every thief and robber (hall be tied
to a flake, with this inscription in large letters,
Mufcadin (fop or petit maitre), on his bread.
3d, That whosoever will occasion the slight

on tor threats, (hall be tried by the Popular
Tribunal, as a counter revolt!tionift.

sth, That every mendicant or idler (hall be

Chaumetteâ u The jundlion of eur armies
was happily effe&ed at La Vendee. The rebels
are now fliut up as in a rat trap ; if they (hou'd
escape from thence, let us all exclaim, treason !
treaibn ! Let us ail rife together, and call for
the punishment of the traitorsâwe are threat
enedâthe women ef the town are turning de
votee!. They are paid by the priesthood. Not
daring to carry on openly their infamous trade,
they go into thÂ« churches and pray. They are
anxious to create scenes of horror, and ihed more
blood in the streets of Faris, and renew with
the priests St. Bartholemew's day. He enume
rated all the misfortunes occasioned by fanatic
cifm in La Vendee, where the Ruftians, with
therofaryin hand, aftaflinated our brothers,
and threw them into the fire."
m&t3m
Chaumctte praifcd the people of Paris who
have renounced idolatry, and only adore the
Supreme Being ; but he was apprehensive left
the clergy should still ensnare the good citi
zens.
4t The priests, (said he) whose altars are built
on the human Ikulls, are capable of every
crime ; they make use of poison to fatisfy their
revenge ; and if you do not take care, tlicy
will work miracles. They will poison the
warmefl patriots, burn the commons house and
the national treasury, they will spring mines,
renew a gunpowder plot ; and when their
vitftims ihall pcrilh by fire, sword, and poison,
then will cry outâlt is heaven that punilhes
them.
He moved the council to declare, that if any
commotion is stirred up in favour of fanaticifm
that all the clcrgy (hail be imprisoned. (Ap
plauded.) And considering that the people of
Paris, have declared, that they acknowledge no
other worfoip than that of reason and truth,
the council refoived :
i ft, That all the churches and temples of
different religions and worship which are known
to be in Paris {hall be instantly (hut.
ad, That whatever troubles may ensue in
Paris, in tonfequence of religious motives, the
priests and miniUer* of the different religions
(hall each be particularly refponfibie.
3d, That every perfbn requiring the opening
of a church, or temple, (ball be put under ar
rest as a fulpe&ed person.
4th,That the revolutionary committee are
invited to have a watchful eye over the clergy
of every denomination.
sth, That there shall be addrelTed a petition
to the Convention, to invite them to decree,
that priefls (ball be excluded every public func
tion and administration, as well as from tfce
manufacture of arms of every kind.
6th, That the prefem refolutio* ihall be
printed, posted up, andfent to the department
of Paris, to the commons of its diftritt, to the
fe&ions and popular societies of Paris.
From the Paris papers of the 13d, 14th, Â«sth,

Mr. Fenno,
You are requeued to pu'v'ifii the fi.l
lowing remarks on an article from a cor
respondent in the General Advertiser of
Tuelday last, entitled,
" RELIGION OF FRANCE."
St. Bartholomew's, Wars, Murders,&c.
Mr. Bache's correspondent, I suppose, has
logic enough, and religion little enough,
to charge the crimes of mankind to the
score of religion itfelf. If any existing
society of men is to be described by the
abuse committed in the dreadful times of
civil or religious revolutions, where reli
gion unfortunately was complicated with
temporal interests, let that immaculate so
ciety Hep forward; let modern philosophy
itfelf fay, :f it dare, Munda Sum afanguinc.
Let the curious read the most partial his
torians, even Rapin himfelf, relating the
religious persecutions in England; let
them read a few sheets publilhed in the
year 1789, Dublin, by Amy as Griffith,
who was no papist ; let them read, if they
can without horror, the executions of most
innocent men, for the cause of religion
alone, as their sentences proclaimed, in
the days of Elizabeth. Let them ask
those penal laws that punilhed men before
they were bom, or before they were ab)e
to be guilty of a breach of the peaceâ
why men were to be robbed for not be
lieving what they could not ? Sir, Ido not
defend popery, for popery I understand
with Mr. Fox, to be the Catholic religion,
with such creeds as are made for us, but
not with thofc we hold ourselves. Popery,
in the firfl sense, I am convinced, is the
rankest of all heresies. The Catholic re
ligion, in the last sense, has done no harm,
and can do no harm to mankind any
where. Froteftants, with reason, appeal
to their do&rines to be judged by therr,
and why are not Catholics to be allowed
the fame privilege ? The liberal Protes
tant condemns perfection as wickcdr.cfs,
and so does the liberal Catholic. Certain
txclufiors of citizenship, See. are still in
force in some Catholic countries, and the
fame temper is to be found in some protec
tant countries also. The American Pro
testant grieves to find any of his brethren
poflefled by the spirit of persecution, and
in this point the American Catholic is of
the fame sentiment But the mafiacre
of Vaffi ! ofâ&c.
Sir, certain houses of Philadelphia arc
the chief places of resort of the people of
a certain nation, even on that solemn clay
when christians are emploved in divine
worihip. Mud the Catholic religion Lin
fwer for this also ? What reason is there,
or what jufbee, to throw in the face of the
Catholics'of America, crimes committed
hundreds of years ago, thousands and
thousands of miles off? What hiis the Ca
tholic, r.s well as the Protestant, to do
with such men, unless to condemn the
wickedness of the times, and frown on the
perpetrators of robbery and murder? for
fliame ! Mr. Bache's correfpordent, be
come liberal. You are now at least in
a land of freedomâlet the air of America
impregnate your foul with sentiments
worthy of a man and of a chriftian. If
you think it lawful to cut off every head
that may conceive a federal government a
good one, at least leave your fellow citi
zens uninfulted, who conceive their reli
gion the true one. There ate laws in
this country which we observe and revere.
Many among us fought for the liberty to
make and enjoy them. When we trans
gress them, we {hall also transgress our re
ligion, and even then, it is the falfe Catho
lic, but not the Catholic religion that
ought to bear the blame.

It ihuuld have been noticed in the mi
nutes or ytftcrday's proceedhigs of the
Houfc of Representativesâthat the bill
making appropriations for the support of
Government for the year 1794, was read
the third time and pjffcd.
In the account of the Frefident'j mes
sage yefterdny, for " Biitifh Secretary of
' L3 te, read American Secretary of $iate~
On "iVednefday the 79th mil. when
the House were in committee of the whole
on the ftatc of the union, the fecound re
futation tor the protection of the com
merce cf the United State?, against the
Algerine corsairs, being under coniider
ation in the words following, viz. " Re
solved, 1 hat for the purpose of defraying
the cost of a naval armament, and the an
nual e:cpenfe thereof, after the day of
there (hall be levied, collsÂ£ied and
paid upon all goods, wares and merchan
dize, imported into the United States, and
on which aduty < f 7 i-zper cent, is now
payable, an additional duty of one per
cent."
Mr. Dayton said that as on a former
day he had pledged himfelf to the rfoufc,
to offer an amendment to this resolution,
he was now prepared to do it, and (hould
take up very little of the time of the com
mittee in general prefatory remarks.
No member prefeut, he said, could be
'gnonurt that the article, faflimr a .i4er4bc
defenption of those fubjrtted to =, dutv
7 '-2 per cent, were for the most part
purchased, and used by the poorer class
of people who were less able to bear ad
ditronaJ burthens than any otherâThat
Indeed very many of those articles, and
ome of the most important of them were
eal necessaries, and could not be furnifh
ed in this country, but rault be brought
torn abroad, for a long time at lead to
come ; among which he particularly men
turned coarfc woollens, &c.
J hat under this imprefiion he took the
liberty to move that initead of laying- one
per cent, additional dutv, as the felcft
committee had reported, on those articles,
It might be reduccd to one half per cent
on Iv.
1 , Dayton laid he was aware that
I'? 2 rea ' l<^lo n of one half aS proposed by
him, would occasion a diminution in the
sum to be rH,fed of about 75,00Â© dollars
under that head of re vent: r, but that the
committee of the whole might fee and un
derbid his wholepTan and object, before
they decided upon a part, he would in
mÂ« place read .to them what hr intended
to offer as a substitute to remedy that de
ncienc^.
.Here Mr. D. read a variety of fpecific
article which he Arid were either luxuries
, ,"' e ! nd con feq'jcntly consumed or used
by J hole who were moil able to pay the'
duties, or articles which our own artists
fr manufailurers couid supply f u f.
Scitnt quantity, especially if this small
additional protc&ion codd be held out to
them.
The principal of them were as follows,
VIZ.
; On boots 2 J cents per pairâOn shoe.
and f ljjpcrs for men and women, c cents,
and those for children, 3 centsâOn mil
' reaJ 7 made, on artificialflowerj/ea
thers, See. 5 per cent, ad valorem.
| On cast, flit and rolled iron, and
generally all manufactures of iron,
steel, tin, pewter, copper, brass, or
of winch eitFier of these metals is
the article of chief value, not being
otherwise particularly enumerated, '
(brass and iron wire excepted) cabi
net wares, carpets and carpeting
Leather tanned and tawed, and o- e - i
â nerally all manufactures of leader,
Â§ Â° r of which leather is the article of
â¢tj chief value, not otherwise particu
â¢jj larly enumerated.
Medicinal drugs, except those
Â£ commonly used in dying. Matts and
-3 floor cloths, hats, caps and bonnets
-o P ever y fort, gloves, mittens, llock
" ; n S s Â» ftns, buttons, buckles, fheath
g mg and cartridge paper, all powders,
" perfumes, cofmctics and all dentifrice
preparations.
N On gold, silver and plated wares,
gold and silver lace, jewellery and
parte-work, clocks and watches, and
the following groceries, viz. cinna
mon, cloves, mace, nutmegs, ginger,
annifeed, currants, dates, figs,plumbs,
prunes,raifins,oranges,lemons, limes,
and generally all fruits and comfits,
olives, capers, pickles, oil, mustard
[in flour.
On all manufactures of cotton, or of
which cotton is the chief material, printed,
stained or colored, one and a half per cent! !
ad valorem.
The additioual duties which he had
proposed on tire articles he bad thus par
ticularly enumerated, would amount to
about 75,000 dollars, which would be the
diminution oceafioned by the reduction of
a half per cent, agreeably to his motion.
Mr. D. said that he hoped every mem
ber whether he favored or opposed a na
val armament to protest our commerce and
our coasts and harbors, would aid hi'm in
his endeavors to render the wars and
means for raffing the monies as little bur
thenfcme and as unexceptionable as pos
sible. If the resolution for building and
equipping the five frigates, ihould uhi
mately be negatived,. it by no means fol
lowed that the time spent in the difcuflion
and amendment of the resolution imme
d'afe'y u " der consideration, would be
uleleisly lpeiit. In any future call for
money, the ways and means which (hould
be on this occasion preferred, would pro
bably be rcforted to, and it was therefore
ot importance, that all ffiould unite their
exertions, to make the measure as unob
jedtjonahle as pofllblc.
So far as the encouragement of cur
own manufactures could be made to con
sist with the cncreafe of revenue, it was
certainly durable to effect it, and it was
witrt a view to bcth theft important ob
f jea, that he hid l'clected the artreks wfcch
he had enumerated. It was to be remem
bered Mr. D. added, that it was not now
a question whether they ftionld raise more
money, (thishadalready been determined)
but whether the encreafe of duties (hould
tall upon the neceflaries of life, or upon
articles of luxury, and such other articles
as the United States were capable of Ap
plying within themselves, independently
of foreign countries.
After considerable difcuflion which
turned principally upon the propriety of
affording tile protection and encourage
ment which was contemplated in the a
mendment in favor of the iron and of the
iron manufaÂ£Uires of the United States,
it was moved and carried, that locks, hing
es and two or three other articles (which
It was said, COU J(J nol j, e manufaflured in
this country) ihould be excepted.
The motions of Mr. Dayton were then
agreed to, and were adopted as part of
the report of the committee.

PR OM CORREUPQNDNTS,
A correspondent finds no inconf/lency in
conduA of the Government towards
tiltprcfent Mimfler of France and hisprc
cicccjjor, as mentioned in Mr. Bache's pa
per of this morning-. The latter endeavor,
ed to involve this country in a war, oppof.
Ed measures of the government, and in
fulled the Chief Magistrate, The former
hat explicitly exprefled his approbation of
ths measures of the government, teftified
utmost refpeft for the Chief Magis
trate, and has disavowed all the proceed
ings of M. Genet which had a tendency
to war. It is a matter of course then that
the officers of the Federal Government,
and the friends of order, peace and tran
quility (hould manifeft a friendly difpofi
tionto the new Minister, whose language
ana conduct are so congenial with their
w s, as they reprobate the langeage and
proceedings of the cidcvant minister which
tended to disorganize the government, and
introduce all the honors of anarchy and
war. xhe officers of the federal govern
ment and the federal interest of this coun
ty, were never hostile to Franc, under
M. Genet s ministry, but they were hofti/e
to hu proceedings, which appeared to them,
calculated to ruin this country.
It .. natural that Spreaders of peace
mould (hew refpeft to a Minister who is
the mcjjmger of peace it is natural that
the officers of the government (hoald be
pleated with the appearance of one who is
particularly charged to express his appro
bation of the late meafureÂ® of the govcrn-
the desire of his nation to main
tain them. This conduit implies no
change of principles, but an adherence to
a lyftem of peace.
While we abuse Briti'ffi publications for
their attempts to injure the cause of liber
ty, let us not by servile imitation fall into
the lame errors, let ns support a govera
me"t which >* founded on the affections
of the American people, and a model for

and encourage the freedom of the press,

THE want of fufficient information of the 1

periods of that government is now lamented :
Hi herto there hath been but one trial in the

trial, it is however in this work designed to ref
cue|what can be collected thereof from sources
of indifpuiaple authority, so that the fame (hall
be preserved from oblivion.
Another impeachment and the second is now
depending. An officer is charged by the late
Honfe of Reprelentatives, who hath for many
years been largely confided in by this state, and
hath long been at the head of the financial de
partment of the Tame, and it imports the citi
zens to know his conduit, and thecircumftances
which may be brought sot ward on his trial.

state the facts, as they may be brought forward,

! the public.âWith this viewâ
