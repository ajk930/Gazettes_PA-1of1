THE grand principle of Equality, if right
ly understood, is the only basis on which
universal justice, sacred order, and perfect
freedom, can be firmly built, and permanent
ly secured. The vewof it exhibited in this
eflay, at the fame time that it repre/Tes the
infolenc* of office, the tyranny of pride, and
the outrages of oppression ; confirms, in the
mod forcible manner, the necessity of subor
dination, and the just demands of lawful au
thority. So far indeed, from loosening the
bands of society, that it maintains inviolate,
every natural and every civil diftindlion,
draws more clolely every social tie, unite* in
one harmonious and justly proportioned sys
tem, and brings men together on the even
ground of the inherent rights of human na
ture, of reciprocal obligation, and of a com
mon relation to the community.

PHILADELPHIA.iUi reconciliation to obliterate the re
â¢.embrance of the wrongs which they ex
perienced during their revolutionary war
with Great Britain: and whereas a con
duct thus pacific and conciliatory was well
entitled to a reciprocal display of imparti
ality, jultice and beneficence on the pait
of other nations, more particularly on the
part of Great Britain, whose commerce,
manufactures and arts have been as much
promoted ; and whose 'distant and necelfi
tous colonies have been as plentifully sup
plied, by the American market, subse
quent as previously to the fcparation of
the two countries.âBut
Whereas it appears that Great Britain,
unmoved by this generous example, uni
formly a&uated by an ambitious and vin
dictive policy, and equally regardless of
politire compact and of general law, has
denied the rights, attacked the interests,
interrupted the pursuits, and irifulted the
dignity of the United Status ; inasmuch as
She has arbitrarily refufed to surrender
the wdlern polls, conformably to the ex
press ftipuljitions of treaty â
She has clandellinely fomented and main
tained a savage war upon the frontiers of
the United States, conttary to the dic
tates of justice and humanityâ
She has insidiously let loose tbe barbari
ans of Africa, to plunder and enfiave the
citizens of the United Statesâ
She has arrogantly attempted to pre
scribe boundaries to the American com
merceâ
She has basely authorized piratical de
predations to be committed by her own
fnbjefts on the ships and citizens of the
United Statesâ
She has violently seized and sequestered
the vefTels and property of the citizens of
the United States, to the value of several
millions of dollars.
She has insultingly iraprifoned, and
meanly reduced, or forcibly impiefTed iuto
her service, the seamen of the United
States, to the number of several thousands
of citizens.
And (he has contemptuously disregard
ed the reiterated complaints, which such
complicated injuries have produced.
And whereas it is at all time 6 the right
and at a crifie like the prefcnt, it becomes
the duty of the citizens, freely and firmly
to declare their sentiments ; to claim the
protection of their government, and to
give every merited assurance of confidence
and support to those who are employed in
the adminiltration of the public affairs :
Therefore
Resolved, that the citizens of the city
and county of Philadelphia, being duly
imprelfed with the injuries and insults
which Great Biitain has offered to the
rights, commerce and character of the U
nited States; all; and expect, from the
wisdom and patriotism of the general go
vernment ; and they hereby pledge them
selves, cheerfully to support with their
lives and fortunes, the molt expeditious,
and the mod effectual measures (which
appear to have been too long poltponed)
to procure reparation for the pad ; to en
sure fafety for the future; to foder and
protect the commercial intered; and to
render refpedlable and rei'pedted among
the nations of the world, the judice, dig
nity, and power of the American Repub
lic.
And whereas the arduous, but glori
ous struggles of the French nation, to es
tablish a Free Republic, have naturally,
on the one hand, provoked the indigna
tion and resentment of despots, and the
flavei of despots ; while on the other
band, they have railed the sympathy, ad
miration and applause of every enlight
ened and liberal mind, and the remem
brance of the important fcrvice* which
France rendered to America, in her day
of persecution and distress, as well a 9 the
codvidion that the cause of the former
ii virtually the cause of the latter Re
public, and of mankind, cannot fail, to
command the grateful and patriotic wish
es of the citizens of the Union, for the
triumph and profpcrity of their friend
and ally: Under this impreflion, there
fore,
Rrfolved, That is the earned hope
Â»nd recommendation of the citizens of
the city and county of Philadelphia, that,
whatever may be the political operations
of the general government, those tempo
rary irregularities, in the commercial po
licy of Ftance, which according to the
evidence of the recent decree enforcing
her treaty with the United States, as the
supreme law of her land obviously pro
ceeded from the neceflity, and not from
the will of the Republic, nvÂ»y be regar
ded with a generous indulgence ; and
that every favor, may be flicwn to her ci
tizens, and her cause, which friendlhip.
can dilate and juflicc can allow.
The following rcfolulion being pro
posed after the adoption of the forego*
ing, was like wile,, unanimoully agreed
uponâ
Resolved, That the fuffcririgs of Ame
rica calling thus loudly for redress on the
part of the federal government, ititf'the
sense of this meeting that measures adap
ted to prevent more of our property
ftom falling into the hands of Algiers,
or of Britain, will be prudent ; as also,
that duties and prohibitions ought im
mediately to take place on Britilh fliips
and manufa&ures, until reparation for
the losses of our citizens can be obtained,
and the just claims of America, to the
surrender of the western posts be com
plied with.
The Chairman requesting the attenti
on of the meeting to the calamitous litu
ation of our brethren who were enslav
ed at Algiersâthe following refutations
were proposed on that fubjeÂ£t, and una
nimoully adoptedâ
Resolved, That a committee confid
ing of five citizens, be appointed to pre
pare a plan for soliciting donations from
all benevolent and patriotic freemen, for
the purposes of eftaltablifliing a fund, to
relieve and redeem our unfortunate fel
low-citizens, who, failing on board of
veffcls belonging to the port of Philadel
phia, have been captured and enslaved
by the Algerine or any other state.
Resolved, That the above committee
shall report their plan to a general meet
ing of the citizens, to be holden on the
twenty second day of March inft.

Fok the Gazette of the United States
Mr. Fenno,
TO establish the fail mentioned in my re
marks, I answer, I have not seen any pro
clamation from the Executive, withdrawing
the plrmiflion given to the French to fell
their prizes in our ports ; and a month has
not yet elapsed, finee one was fold (the Ca
nada ) in New Yorkâsince that, a prize has
been carried into Charlellon and two into
Norfolk.
It will now be known whether they conti
nue to do it, or not; but a proclamation I
have no doubt will soon be iffued,contradic
ting it, especially as the bill has paflVd the
Senate, entitled a bill " in addition to the
act for the punifliment of certain crimes a
gainftthe United' States" withdrawing this
extra privilege to the French ; but what a
hairs-breadth escape we have had ? 12 to 12,
nothing but the patriotic conduct of the Vice
President saved this country from war inevi
table ; it is to such characters that we mull
look for the salvation of this country.
I beg leave to refer to some pafiages : Mr.
Jefferfon's letter to Mr. Morris at Paris " the
President tho't it expedient thro' thechannel of
a proclamation to remind our fellow-citizens
that we were in a state of peace with all the bel
ligerent powers ; that in that state it was our
duty neither to aid nor injury any" again
" The 17th article of our treaty leaves arm
ed veflels free to conduct whithersoever they
please the (hips and goods taken from their
enemies. It is evident that this article does
not contemplate a freedom to fell their prizes
here, but on the contrary a departure to some
other place : but the armed veflels of France
have beenalfo admitted to land and fell tlieir
prize goods here, for consumption" Again
where Mr. J. enumerates at the conclulion
of his letter all the advantages and favours
the French have received, we find the fol
lowing exprelfion " that the exclusive admis
sion to fell here the prizes made by France on
her enemies, in the present war tho' unjlipu
lated in our treaties and unfounded in her
own pradtice,or in that of any other nation"
Let our countrymen read the foregoing,and
then fay that they have given no offence to
Â£ngland, but have done all in their power
to maintain peace. SÂ® much has been done
as I will venture to fay, would have bro't
a war upon this country for this very thing,
if those nations had not had enough already
upon their hands.
I would refer also to the President's ad
dress at the opening of the feflion for fur
ther light; also to the declaration of the jud
ges of the Federal Court.

House of Reprefentatiiies.
Friday, March 14.
In committee of the whole on Mr. MadiforCs
refutations
Mr. Ames observed, that the additional
duties were intended, he believed, to operate
generally, and that their operation wouid
fall on the middling clafTes of people. But
the refolutioas would also affe<st our exports,
and in this view injure our cutters of timber,
makers of pot ash ; and farmers in general
would feel their operation deeply, all this for
the advantage of our ftiip owners.
If the resolutions cannot now be termed
trifling, then indeed, he had mistaken, their
true character, he said. In a moment of dan
ger, when our commerce is nearly annihila
ted, it is trifling to talk of regulating it, when
we fliould attend to our defence only. When
brought forward they had an alarming ap
pearance ; negociations were pending. We
should always fay peace to the last extremity,
and if war threatens strain every sinew to
prepare for it. The resolutions fay nothing ;
they fay worse than nothing ; they are built
on partiality for one nation, they have French
stamped on the very face of them. If we feel
that the Engiifh have injured us let us put
the country in a state of defence, the refolu-*
tions can do nothing towards this. It is folly
to think of regulating a commerce, that calls
firft for prote&ion, and to encourage the en
creafe of navigation when what flipping we
have, is in jeopardy.
Mr. Murray said, when war is flaring us
in the face, he wondered gentlemen did not
feel that the resolutions are not proper. They
are bad as a permanent system ; bad in the
present exigency. He was surprized that the
friends of the resolutions, when they were
the fubje<sl of difcuifion before, should appear
to feel so much from the injuries infli<fted by
Great Britain, and now that they are encreaf
ed ten-fold, should not have risen in those
feelings. He was surprized to fee their minds
stationary, though the danger is growing,
and to find every measure of energetic de
fence which had been proposed, opposed by
the gentlemen. The present critical ;un<slure,
called certainly for vigorous proceedings, and
under this impreflion the oppofers of the re
solutions, had been bold to call them trifling.
In a commercial point of view, they are ill
calculated, and were hazardous when peace
was yet within our reach, but when a change
of circumflances has given us a profpedl of
war, they are too trifling.
He put a cafe. Would a farmer differ with
his wife and daughters about the pedlar, they
would give a preference to, in purchasing their
gew-gaws ; whether they would employ the
English, Scotch or Irish pedlar, when one of
them was stealing the sheep and wantonly
sporting with the property on the farm. No
certainly, they would unite and drive the
thief off. It isjuft as ridiculous in the legis
lature to be now spending their time about
commercial regulations. More energetic mea
sures are neceflary. How is an additional 10
per cent, on importations capable of opposing
the torrent of British injustice. Let all in
tercourse with Great Britain be flopped un
til they give us fatisfa&ion for the
they have done us. This would be exhibiting
a temporary enmity for a temporary evil;
but the adoption of the resolutions would
evince an eternal enmity and at the fame
time want the energy which the urgency of
the cafe would require.
Mr. Parker rose to set the gentleman last
up right as to one aflertion. He said that the
friends of the resolutions were opposed to
every energetic measure which had been pro
posed. T his was not the cafe ; indeed, un
lefshimfelf andfeveral other members, friends
to the resolutions, had voted for some of those
more energetic meaufures they would have
failed.
Mr. Murray thought he confined his ob
servation, to a majority of the friends of the
resolutions.
Mr. Parker believed the resolutions would
be beneficial to his country and tend to en
courage our manufaftutes. Under this im
prefiion, he was in favor of them. He wished
all party diftindlions dropt, at the present cri
tical jun&ure, he did not like to hear of these
gentleman and those gentlemen : let us unite
as one. A member from Mafiachufetts con
ceived the resolutions boretheftamp of French
on the very face of them. He wiflied, for
his part, that every body and every thing
could be plainly read by some such device,
we lhould fee what and who is French and
who is Englifti. He should not, he hoped,
let prejudice get the better of his reason, but
thought however, that he never could forget,
that probably without France the legislature
would not be deliberating within these walls.

in our power. The Aufttians have re
treated to their camp at Balberhof, from
whence they mull be driven, in order to
get to Landau. In the course of yefte -
day four cannon were taken, inllead of
two, as was mentioned firft, and 20,000
cartridges for cannon. The enemy in
their retreat from Weiflembourg left be
hind 1500 muskets, a great number sick
and wounded, two hundred of our bre
thren which had been made prisoners at
different times. In their retreat we have
taken from them 10 pieces of cannon, four
teen forage waggons, one waggon with
shoes, and we are yet on the march, a
whole company that has deserted is just
come in, and the brave defenders of the
Republic are eager for action."
January ill, 1794.
" Aristocracy is put to the flight,
writes the popular society of Befort."
Royalifm is annihilated. The mal con
tents and traitors are every where pursued.
Superilition is in despair fanaticifm is va
nished, reason governs ; the afiignats are
at par, the tax goes on well; the conlli
tutional au horities ast up to their great
principles ; the people is calm j the Po
pular Societies are restored : the Republic
is the general cry of the inhabitants of
the Upper Rhine. If you ask, Legisla
tors, who has operated these prodigies : It
is Herault!"
This letter, which was read in the be
ginning of this days fefiion, was ordered
to be inserted in the minutes, and was
followed by another from Ganier repn Ten
tative of the people in the department of
Orne : he fays that the Catholic army in
passing through the towns of Mans and
La Flcehe have left there two scourge*
worse than war itfelf, viz. famins and
the plague, and that he has taken the ne
ceflary steps to put a flop to both.
In the beginning of the session some
letters had likewise been read, which mer
tion the railing of the siege of Landau ;
the committee of public fafety, waÂ«
therefore required to make their report,
and Barrere in the name of this commit
tee appeared in the tribune, where he was
received with the loudest acclamations.
This member gave the certain and offi
cial account that the siege of Landau,
this important place, this key to the Re
public, was positively raised. The rc
prefentatives of the people entered that
city at the head of the French columns
the 28th December. On the preceeding
day the republican troops were in pursuit
of the enemy, who fled and abandoned
magazines and positions which formerly a
handful of freemen defended againll
whole armies. Fort Vauban (St. Louis)
is surrounded on all fides, and will be
clear in a Ihort time of all the slaves of
despotism.
The National Convention, decreed,
that the armies of the Moselle and of the
Rhine, as well as the inhabitants of Lan
dau had deserved well of their Country.
The Prince of Hohenlohe had fum
monedthe commandant of Landau to sur
render the place ; he had even written to
the garrison to engage them not to refill
any longer the efforts of the combined ar
mies ; but Laubadere and his brave bre
thren in arms answered the Prince is the
style of true Republicans. The enemy
fays that they have thrown into Landau
40,000 (hells, and oui brave defenders a
gree that at least 25,000 have been thrown
in. The inhabitants and the garrison
were reduced to the necessity of living an
bread made of (horts and oats; but the
love of their country and of liberty was
in their hearts and the republic triumphed.
The gate of Spire will soon be open for
us, and the satellites of the German ty
rants, will soon be forced to acknowledge,
that the French republic is invincible and
imperi {liable.
Several officers of the army of the
Rhine gave these details at bar, and
on motion of Moses Bayle th< President,
Couthon, gave them in the m.tne of the
national representation the fraternal cm
brace.
Charlier laid before the conwcntloo theXnoft eoanncing proofs of the imposition
and villany of the commifTaries of cloth
ing of the republican armies ; the conven
tion decreed that these commissaries should
be brought before the revolutionary tribu
nal, as well as the aristocrat minister of
War, to whose department the matters be
longed.
On motion of Billaud de Varennes it
was decreed that all the general officers
condemned to die by the revolutionary
tribunal shall be executed at the head of
the armies ; and that the above mentioned
commifTaries and assistant minister, if found
guilty and condemned, shall share the fame
fate. -
Letter from the President and Members

with the army of the Weft, to the
Commonalty of Paris, dated Saumur,
6 Nivofe, (December 25.)
" We have to communicate to you the
interesting news of the total deftruftion
of the banditti on the right banks of the
Loire. There are here and there yet
some small remains of these monsters in
the interior parts of La Vendee, but as
bur armies are no longer obliged to di
vide themselves, they will undoubtedly
foÂ®n clear the whole country. Those
who solicit the Convention to prevent the
great measures of public welfare, and
try to inspire them with a falfe compas
sion, are either traitors or egotists. If
yoa had seen like me, what this fanatic
herd is capable of! Patriots thrown into
the fire alive, others cut and chopped to
pieces. Two days before the siege of
Angers, in a country which was suppo
sed to be all sacred to Libeityâthree
hundred soldiers were afTaffinated by these
monsters, in the neighbourhood of Che
ir.eville, and nevertheless the evening be
fore they had cried Vive la Rcpubliqut ! !
and deelaved that they sincerely repented
of their errors ; and in different parts of
this uuhappy country, similar events have
taken place.

Anacharfis Cloota, expelled from the Na
tional Convention as a stranger, has been ar
retted asfufpetled, and all his papers sealed
up, Thomas Paine ihared the fame fate.
Another letter to Minier, Member of the
Commonalty of Paris, dated Nantes,
December 25, from the right banks of
the Loire.
" My friend, I inform you that the
enemies are at last totally destroyed.âThe
Generals, the Representatives and the ar
my which were in pursuit of them, are to
re-enter the city this day. The number
of banditti, which are brought in here eve
,ry day, these ten days pall, is unaccounta
ble ; they come in every moment. The
guillotine is too flow, and as this is the
fame cafe with (hooting them, which be
sides takes a great deal of powder and balls,
they have taken a measure of putting them
to a certain number into the holds of boats,
then conduct them to the middle of the
river about half a league from the city,
and then fink the boats. This operation
is going on conilantly. All thecaiffoons
and cannon, which the rebels had yet,
have been brought in here. Most all their
chiefs are killed; the ci-devant prince de
Talmon, duke dela Tremoille is said to be
taken; a fine prize for the guillotine in
deed. There will not one of the banditti
be left alive, for not one is pardoned, an A
this is highly necefTary. Some detach
ments of our troops are yet searching all
the villages in the neighborhood of Save
ray.becaufe there are arms found here and
there, and some of the banditti, who have
concealed themselves in howfes, but these
are few ; not above 600 in all have.afcap
ed, and these will certainly be re-taken.
Ancennis, Angers, St. Florent and other
places are full of prisoners, but they would
not be long so; for they will certainly
soon receive the Patriotic baptism."

NEW-YORK, March 20.
Orders have been given by the British
Lords of Admiralty, to all their comman

nuary, all neutral veflels whatever, bound
to or from France, or the Islands of Mar
tinique, Guadaloupe, St. Domingo, &c.
which are declared to be in a ttate of
siege. A similar order has been given
by the French Minister of Marine, to
capture all vessels bound to any of the
belligerent powers. In both cases, the
order extends only to those veflclsf having
provisions, naval (lores, &c. on board,
and which the laws of nations authori
se. The French are said to have captu
red 13 fail of Danilh (hips, laden with
provision. Which nation issued the firtt
order, is not known ; but each nation

Every year France imported iix million
pounds of foreign wool for the making
of cloth. She has (hut up her ports, and
matters of the fii tt neceflity are absolutely
wanting.
In consequence it has been ptopofed to
eftabllfh new manufaitoiics of cloth, in
which {hall be used only two-thirds of
the wool of animals, and one third of the
hair of meu and women. A petition was
made, praying the Convention to autho

We are allured, that afterwards the de
cree was pafled, and that there will be a

fays the author of the gazette, will to
the epithet of Sans Culotte, add that of
Sans Cheveux.
Mr. Davis,
It was a custom among the Romans, to
trust the care of the Republic to the Most
Tried and Experienced men. It might
perhaps be wife for America to pursue a
similar policy.
Youth is naturally fond of action and
innovation. At that period of life, Am
bition appears in all its charms:âUntil
men are cured of its follies, they certainly
are not the most fit to be entrusted with
the happiness of a nation. Among the
ancient Germans, the Old ruled in the
Council the Young executed in the
field.
NEWARK, March iÂ»,

From the Virginia Gazette.
The Romans took particular pains to
inftrudt their youth in the social institu
tions, and the mod celebrated Republics,
and they were ftnt to learn and imbibe on
the spot, every thing which might conduce
to the liappinefs of their own country.
The young men of our itate poflcls ge
nius, generotity, and courage : Alimilar
fyllem of education, might render them
invaluable members of foeiety.
The noblest examples of Republican
virtues now existing, are to be found in
the New England Slates. Theie our youth
cculd not fail to. imbibe lefibnsâperhaps
superior to those formerly furoiihed by
Athens itfelf. A sojourning among thefc
virtuous people, previous to any public em
ployment, might be attended with the
moll beneficial effects.
The rendering of matrimony a pre-re
quifite to public honours, couid not fail
also, of producing the best effetts: Per
haps no man can feel fufficiently his so
cial duties, or a proper attachment to his
country, who is not bound by such fkrong
and endearing ties.

An EfTay on Slavery:
Designed to exhibit in a new point of view,
its effects on morals, indujlry, and the peace of
society. Some facts and calculations are offered
to prove the labor of freemen to be much more
produflivc than that ot slaves ; that countries ate
rich, powerful and happy, in proportion as the
laboring people enjoy the fruits of their own
labor ; and hence the nrceffary conclusion, that
slavery is impolitic as well as unjiifi.
