CONSTANTINOPLE, August ib. \
Revolutionary Commotionsâ¢ 1
A great fermentation ftil! reigns in this â¢
capital, and the police will be forced to re
ltle. double it's vigilance in order to hinder the '
0 E people from committing violence upon the (
3*l* French who are here. However the go- '
vernment still continues to aft with modera
Â§ tion and caution towardslhem. Every one
interprets this ctfridutt according to hts own
w wishes of opinion. Some fee in it a secret t
intellrgence with the French, others believe t
it to be only an aÂ£fc of eircumfpeftion, which I
tate agrees with the secrecy of the military ope- c
eaf- rations that are preparing. If any thing P
it â can solve this specieÂ« of problem, it is the ''
h a '" prdfrs iflued by the Porte to all the provinces
of the Empire. The preamble ii conceived n
in terms of the must marked indignation ; c |
the proceedings of the French is there re- b
presented as the most unjust a<s of aggref- tr
fioti and highly contrary to the faith of
J treaties. I hefe orders perfcribe measures
' *' offeiafive and hostile.
It. The Englitfi Minifler appears to have
muchi influenced these determinations, and te
his a&ive zeal negleds nothing that carj pe
0- tend to fl lengthen the energy of govern- 111
rth ment. The Ruffian Ambaflador does not
appear to fhew.ltfs aftivity in his negocia
' lions; but we do not remark a concert in
ftie operations of the two Mioifters, and if
f or they tend to the fame end, the means they
ing purfuc are widely different.
Buonaparte has addressed a letter to the
_ Divan, in which he fays, tbat if the Otto- p,
man Porte should permit the Ruffian fleet to
pass the Dardanelles, he lhall consider it as
a declaration of war.
He requires the Grand Signior to put
aside all the pretensions of Russia ; to op- COl
pose firmly all attempts which that Court ! e Â£
all might make ; and adds, that he has the
he greatest reason to expeft fach a line of con
at dudt from him, as he has delivered him Tl
from hrs gieateft enemies, the Knights of liv
_ Malta. Fr
e- Phe Porte received on the 31ft ult. the a ' )l
Jt | confirmation of Buonaparte's debarkation t ' u
Â«'t Alexandria. Possessing that city, with
little resistance, he immediately proceeded
_ against Rofetta, the garrison of which being j, a
few in number, fled at his approach He chi
immediately afterwards dire&ed his march the
on to Grand Cairo. We are not acquainted
with what has since passed, but it appears ani
_ certain that the Beys, forgetful of their
personal animosities, have united closely, 0 f
and have collefted a confiderabl: number of
troops, which has been much increased by wh
the Arabs. This army stationed itfelf at wh
about twenty leagues from Rofetta, be- ani
_ tween that town and Cairo, with a view to the
dispute the passage. It is further added,
Pacha of Palestine has also succeeded \^ u
in cSÃeaing a large body of men, at the "hij.
he head of which he was to have marched am
against Alexandria. the

on the fide of the Janifaries ; for, it is well J"'"
, knows, that it was on account ot the latter , "
c that the war broke out between the grand i- 1
1 Turk and Paffawan Oglou ; because an at

h ' We stop the press to announce, that wc dri
learn from undoubted authority, that by i wh
the admiralty Telegraph intelligence has ! gai
just been couveyed, if a French paper of! fro
a the 15th having been this forenoon landed 1 firr
at Dover, containing the very gratifying in- cnt
. formation of an action having taken place par
between admiral Nelson and the French vie
fleet, in which the Brrtifh was happily vie- for
toriou9.
Tlie various accounts which have been re- riv.
j ce' refpedmg the operations of tfte and
French army under Buonaparte, hav<r much is f
contributed to perplex the public opinion.
That of Saturday, by the Hamburg mail,
'of the French having fuflaintd a very con- â¢,
fiderable defeat, seemed to', be contradlfted t
' and overthrown by the account received by ? '
3 the India Company, from their agent Â°| C
at Conilantineple ; while on the other hand r
. ft'i'ements by the mail which arrived on Cm
Monday, seemed to confirm those brought are .
by the former. We have been at great n",
pains tu trace these various accounts, to "
[ compare and to digest them ; and we think afe
we can fay with a considerable degree of 3p ?
confidence ; that the company's agent must a C
have adopted vague and hasty reports, while W Â°"
j le lllt *lligence by the mails was founded on '
[ more authentic information. By. letters
from Couftantinople, of as recent a date a? T 3
, those received by the overland dispatch, and
winch amount in fad to offieial authority, it W Â° l '
seems certain that Buonaparte had received 3 â¢
, a very considerable defeat near Rofetta, in ' C k ' S
; consequence of which he vas obliged to en- I
camp and entrench himfelf. I n this situa
tion he could neither advance nor retreat, S , CB '
. while the Arabs we e collecting in immense 161
numbers with the determination to attack
and overwhelm him. Fir m a view of the v\
rap, and after a temperate consideration of e left
all circumftaoces, we are (trengtliened in our diftr
opinion that the accounts of Buonaparte The
having pofTeffed himfelf of Grand Cairo, th,t
mult be unfoundsd. It is a parch of about hi^ U
120 or 130 miles through a country present- n

as gain possession of Rofetta in order to go
of J from thence to Cairo, but was refilled so
firmly, chat he was obliged to retreat and
n- entrench himfelf in his camp. Lang pre
:e paration has been made here to fruftrate his

Paris papers till 17 th inft. have been re

that admiral Ntlfon has, by the total de
struction of the French fleet, o'n its return
from \lcxdria, made ample amends for his
former ill lutk. " The squadron If admi j
ral Brilcys," fay* the Suoplimeut to the

velfrls remained totally disabled on the scene
of adioii. We are anxious for their fate "
The authenticity of this intelligence, which
was repeated in'the Pari- papers of the 15th
and 16th his been doubled by many, be
cause it had fir ft appeared o r ly in the Sup
plement of the Rtda&eur ; but when we
confidcr that the Supplement also contains a
from the diredlory to the council
of Five Hundred, on the fubjed of Buon
aparte's entra ce into Egypt, which is cer
tainly official ; and that it has been the po
licy of tha French government, from the
days of Barrere to the present, to commu- j
nicate the bad news which they could not
conceal, linger the covert of some intelli
gence more consoling ; these relutant con
fellionÃ of the direftory ieem fafficient, in
our cpiuion, to juftify our yielding almolt
implicit credit to the rep.irt.
The mefTage to the dirtftory on the fub
jeft of Bnonaplrte's entrance into Egypt, i
a copy of which will be found under the j
French department, is a fort of manifefto,
in which .the dire&ory unbliTfttrhgle malt*
the wrongsÂ»f the \r'abs of forty years en
durance, the pretence for an aggression ob
viously founded i â¢ i ordinate ambition'and
â¡ spirit of aggrandizement.
There is now no doubt that Buonaparte,
reached Cairo on the 22d July. It would
appear, therefore, that the opposition he
met with 011 the way thither for Alexandria,
if u? met w:th any, was extremely impo
tent. It is also probable, that the ultimate
object of !iis expedition is India, with a
view to deitioy the power and interest of
Great liritain in that quarter, to the at
tainment of which the pofTrflion of Egypt
is a necessary appendage.
These papeis also contain a letter from
Savary and fiom gener 1 Humbert to the
minister sf marine, on the landing of the
French in Ireland. Sangu.ne as it would
thence appea were the hopes of Humbert,
th y have, happily for this country, been

MV LOXD,
It i> with tire greatejl pleasure 1 have the honor
to inform yaur lordship, that yesterday morning (
ot g o'clock, Carthagena hearing N. 79, W. dif
tant 19 league; ( had the "good fortune to fall in
with a fquidron of Spasilh frigates, as per mir
gin*, and that after having brought them to c!of>
ailion, about a quarter poll eleven o'clock, which 1
lasted with great warmth till ten minutes past one,
P. VI. theeneny was totally defeated and put t<
flight, leaving the Dorothea to her fate, having
hoisted an Englilh ensign with the Union down
wards ; and as I considered her in the greatest dis
tress, I loft not a momept in taking pofTelHon
which was done in the face of the three remaining
frigates, dillant about two miles on my weather
i bow.
Ih detailing the particulars of the ahove affair,
I havs to inform your lordfliip,that at the moment
the frigates w re descried in the S. E. quarter, the
Lion was (leering East with a crowd of fail, the
wind moderate at W. 3. W. aha as I soon discover
ed by their signals and other n-anceuvres they were
j enemies, I immediately clcarel (hip for a&ion,
I which being effected in the Ihorteft time l ever re
colleit to have seen, I acquainted the officers and
j (hip's company with my intertion of immediately
j bringing he frigates to the closest aition polfihle;
| and observing the cheerfulness with which it waÂ»
j received, I dctetmn ed not to lafe a moment to
. nn 'i t .cV 1 a
fills and firll reefs of the topi'ails, in order to fe
curethe fighting of the lower battery, and hauled
up towards the frigates which were fte:ringfor
the Lion. Having ft cured '.Hk weather gauge, 1
bore down 011 the enemy, who was forming in a
close order of battle on th; larboard fide of bear
ing : the third frigate from the van had loft her
f ire-top mast. It imm<idia'ely occurred to tr e that
the crippled (hip was my objedl.in order tofecure
a general a&ian ; fupnofint* that a Spaniard (from
the nobleness rtf his character) would never with
fÂ® funerier a force forOke a friend in diltrefs. In
this I fortmatelyfucceeded ; and ft-ering for and 1
c'oGng with the crippled ship, which was now bÂ«-
come-the ilernmoil in rh line of battle tha other
three frigates tacked : n fucceffi m, and patted the
I.ion verygaTla.'itljr within mo'Ve.fhot S but asrheir
line after tacking washy no mears atlofe one, they I
each received a well directed broadiide from the
I.i n ; "he good effect of whioh was very vifi!)le
by their (landing a coaliderable time On that tack.
I still continued to steer lor the crippled Ihip, who
nearly failing as well as the Lion, galled h-r very 1
confi.'erably in the riyging Sy hÂ«r stern chafes.
The three frigates made a second close
attempt, but not so close as the tormer, to
support her, and were each fully repaid by
an exchange of broa-dfides. " t length w'
clofr d with the crippled ship, and poured in v
a dtftruilive fire, the yard ariris being just 1
cltar of each other ; he nev. rtbfl fs did no' i
strike for feme time after. At this period I i
fonnd the Lion totally ungovernab'e, hav
ing all her braces, bowlings, clue garnets,
&c. shot away, the foreftil nearly rendered 1
ufclcfs, and the other fails much torn, 1
The three frigates a third time made a 1
distant and feeble effort to protect and cover 1
the ditlrefled frigate, b\it in vain ; they did
not dare to approach within th<* diflanse to
do so, and by grÂ«a! exertions being enabled
to wear round on the fame tack with the i
frigate that had now (truck her colouis, and ;
fubflituted the English Enfitrn in its place, 1
I closed with and took poffefiion of h.r aÂ£
before related
During the remainder day we were
lying to, fully employed in repairing the
rigging, bending new canvas, and securing
the prize, in order to enable me, if poflihle,
to go in pursuit of the three frigates, which
were making off close by the Wind to the
N. W.
Now, my Lord, it is with the greatest
and molt heartfelt pleasure to me th?t this
service has bee# effected with the probable
loss of only one poor man, who has had his
thigh amputated, as likewise Mr Patey,
mldfhipman, (lightly wounded ill the shoul

(he has her mizen-tnaft and fore top-mast (
carried away, .and fails and rigging cut to c

lief of the wounded men on board, the Sur- 1

might be from twenty to forty killed in the

From the London Star, of September I.
On Saturday we laid before our readers
the accounts brought by the Hamburgh
mail, of a defeat said to have been experien
ced by Buonaparte near Cairo. We have
now to state intelligence of a very different
nature, which was received in the course of
that day at the India House, and which we
think much better entitled to credit.
Mr. Tooke, the Company's rcfident at
Constantinople, in a letter to the direftorj,
dated the 10th ulf which wa< f rwarded
by a special mefTenger, informs them that
Buonaparte had not only made himfelf ma
ster of Alexandria, but of Rofetta, Damietta
and Grand Cairo, tho not without conside
rable loss, havingbeenharrafTed by the Arabs
and Mamelucks, whom, however he had
dispersed with great (laughter. The intel-
ce is given Mr. Tookcon the authori
ty of letters from Aleppo, dated the 28th of
July.
It is extremely probable that the sub
stance of this intelligence is true, though
there are difficulties to its receiving full ere- 1
dit. Rofetta is only between 40 and 50 1
â¢T.iles diftanr from Alexandria which he 1
might reach in a little time, without very '
i>reat labor j but from thence to Damietta
he cculd not poflibly march at the season ; '
for the Nile begins to. overflow its banks
about the end of May, and all the low lands
continue inundat d till the to.th or 20th of '
Augustâsometimes even to the end of Sep- '
tember. Through such a country no arrr.y '
could march a diltance of about 100 miles,
even if yve suppose the waters to have fub
lided earlier than usual; for the ground al
ways continues foft and muddy for some f
time after. i
To Cairo the the French might proceed i
Â«?ireÂ£t from Ruf tra without such an impe- 1
diment, but the diilance is about 150 miles, 1
and could not but expose them to consider- i
able danger, if by any means the enervated
and e: fl<ived inhabitants may have been
routed into aft ion ; which may poflibly have
been the cafe if the Fi-mun said to have
been ifTued by the Porte, addrefTed to the
Bashaws and BeyÂ« of Egypt, and which 1
wa-i brought over by the Hamburgh mail, )
may be coofidcitd as genuine. It directs 1
them to throw every possible cbftruftion in i
the way of the infidels, who were invading t
the country with a view of overturning its
religion, and endeavours to rouse them to i
adopt the molt vigorous measures, so that (
the Â«nemy may not, be permitted lo carry t
even a fraii tj'fand out of the Sultan's do- 1
miuio V/ ,
Bui it is possible Buonaparte may have <
gone from Rofetta to Damietta by sea, <
> having prcvioufly ordered bis fleet from J
! Al-xairdria to the former, while lie pro '
, ceeded there by laod : or having left 9 fuf- v
i ficient garrison in Alexandria lie may have d
even gonÂ£ to RsCetta by fcaâtaker, and ti
; (jarrifoned it, and then again embarked for
â  Damictta. This appears the wisest and t
â¢ most rational plan that could be followed ; i
i for admiral Nelson having left Buanapar'e 3
i complete matter of the eastern extremity of y
1 jhe Mediterranean, there was nothing to >
i oppose his progress by fca. Beiog once ar- i
â¢ rived at Damietta, he could go up the a
large eastern branch of the Nile to Cairo, in c
- boats, the common paflage being only a- e
bout fix or seven days. -
In which ever way we ftt'- pnfe him to 2
have reached Cairo, h:Â» progtefe must have <â 
b-en rapid irideed ; for he reached Alexan- t
dria on the 7th or Bth of July, and the ac- '
; counts of his arrival at Cairo are stated to 1
have arrived at Aleppo on or before the 28th <â 
of the fame month ; that is within 20 days, '
1 though so much was to be dÂ»ne in the time. '
and the news to travel upwards of 270
â¢ leagues.

: MR. COBBET,
As your ingenious oomfpondeeis have 1

i my ideas refpefting it worthy of a place in

i I am of opinion, that at twelve o'clock
' in the night fucceedifig the prtfent day
(Nov. 13' 1798 years io months and 13
days of the chriltian xra will then have e
lap ed, and that on ihe 31ft of December
next, at midnight, which wii!complete that ,
day, 1799 years w'll then have clapfcd ; c
consequently, on the 31ft of Dssemb-r,

have J)*(kit, and the next moment r.ftcrwarili
which will be ibe firll minute oÂ£ the firft
day of JanifÃry," tÃoo, wij[ also -bo the firt
minute of the nineteenth century.
It this be nt the cafe, mltead of datmg
the prefcut year, 1793, we fliould call it the
1798 th year of < tif Lord; and the*, the
31 'i of December next, will complete 1798

18 years a'<d fomÂ« m .nibs old. If I anÂ»
afktd my age, I either reply. I am 18 years
old, or, I am in the 19th year ef my age )
eighty years htnee, if I live so lung, I (hall
be 98 years old, and in the 99th year of my?
ageâone year afterwards I Ihallb 99 yea"'<
old, and in my huadreth 'year, conf.-qiierirtly
the dole of the year in which I I date 99
will be the close of my firll century, and if
I fllould live 1700 years longer, the wise
acres of those days will perhaps puzzle their
brains to determine what year doles the 181b
Century of the life of your humble fervaut,
