DEBATE [
On the motion of Mr. J. Parker, for referring w
certain Refolutiorfs of Captain Magilien's a
Company, to a committee of the whole n
House. d
f Concluded from our last.) n
Mr. J.Parker had not the leaf! doubt
that the censure contained in these proceed- j (
ings was levelled as much against him as any n
branch of the government, as he did not be-
lieve the fab fcribers had latterly approved'of v
his condud, on account of his having voted j,
in favour of some establishments which they
condemn. He. was farther led to suppose r
this from the proceedings having been sent to j
him under a blank cover. Mr. P. again ur- j
ged the propriety of referring this paper.â ]
Much had been said about the indelicacy of j
expredion used in thisaddrefs; it was his o- j,
pinion that a memorial which he held in his
hand from Falmouth in MalTachufetts, which j,
was some days ago received without oppofiti- t
on, was equally objectionable in this refpeii. p
Mr. P. read an extratt from it, in which the v
addreflers fay, that " they behold with dtfap- c
probation and surprize the mefTage 6f the f
President, which fays, that he has taken off f
the restriCtion, which they think was' laid in j
wisdom by the late President, for the pre- ]
venting the arming of merchant vefi'els, and ]
which they think now more necessary than (
when it was atfirit laid."
Mr. Thatcher was opposed to a refer- J
ence of this address. He acknowledged ihe j
right which the people had to petition ; but ,
went into some lengthy observations to prove ,
that their representatives had not given up all
their rights by accepting a feat in Congress, 1
and that it was' not right for them to fit to be
infill ted, without (hewing a disapprobation
of the insult.
Mr. Brent said, it had been admitted by
the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Sit
greaves) t]iat if the fubjett matter of the ad
dress before the House had been decently ex
pressed, no objection would have been made
to it on account of the opinions which it con
tained; other gentlemen, however, had tho't
it was aiibel on the government, and ought
not on that account to be admitted. -
Mr. B. went through the different parts of
the address, and said he saw no way in which
the opinions contained in it could have been
exprelfed in language less objectionable than
that in which they appeared.
But it was said by the gentleman from S.
Carolina (Mr. Rutledge) and by that
this address was a libel on gsvernment. He
saw nothing of the kind in it. Could not there
be persons high in authority, but such as
were in the administration of the Federal Go
vernment ? Neither the government nor the
administration are mentioned ; nor could any
one fay whether, by persons high in authori
ty they meant to refer to the Executive or to
members of the Legislature. It might even
allude to persons in the Judicial, or some o
ther department ot government. But admit
ting that these persons meant to (ay that any
branch of this government had endeavoured
to give a falfe colouring to the late difpateh
es, and by that means toinvolve us in warâ
if this was their opinion, they have the fame
right to express it that others have to pass
their eulogiums on the conduct of the Presi
dentâit is a right which is guaranteed to
them by the Corfnitution. and of which they
cannot therefore be deprived.
But it had been said this address refle&ed
upon the conduit of our Commillionersâmen
whom we are told may at this monlent have
become victims of their patriotism. Here,
gentlemen futtered their zeal to carry them
1 beyond the truth, as not a word can be found
in thisaddrefs which has the lealt reference to
our Commiflioners. What was said respeCt
ing the dispatches, had no connection with,
â¢ the Envoys theinfelves. Mr- B. thought
the rule laid down by the gentleman from S.
[ Carolina was a proper one ; he believed the
House ought to receive all petitions, except
extremely indecent and improper, or none
: He trusted he had (hewn that independent of
the matter, there was nothing exceptionable
Â» in thisaddrefs, and he hoped, therefore, notur
\ ther objection would be made to its'reference.
Mr. Hartley was opposed to the refer
| ence of this petition. He thought it a novel
proceeding for a company of grenadiers to
meet at 400 miles distance, and the Captain
and Lieutenant (hould fend on an address re
probating the measures of government. He
was opposed to the reference of the address
: from the members of the Legislature of this
1 (late, when it was pre fen ted, becatife he did
1 desire to gi.ve countenance to persons who
â¢ widled to shew their diflatisfaflion with the
" measures of our own government, and anat
-1 tachment to the French. Indeed fuck is the 1
â¢ change of opinion which has taken place in
e this country 011 this fubjett, that one of the
5 members who signed that address has signed i
another from Bucks county approbatory of |
the measures of the Executive. It was fio
e thing uncommon to let petitions lie.upon the
table, and he hoped this address would have
the fame fate with that from the members of
e the Pennsylvania Legislature.
Mr. Dana was unwilling to take any part
in this, debate, and would not have done it,
but for what had fallen from the gentleman
- from Pennsylvania (Mr. Gallatin.) He had
reprobated the opposition made to this refer
e ence as arising from an opposition to opinion,
e and adduced two instances to support his af
n fertion, the one of a'memorial from members
y of the Pennsylvania Legislature, the other
. of an address from Mafl'aclmietts. The firft,
d he recollected his colleague obje&ed to on
r the ground of the persons having addressed
l\ the House in their Legifjative character, but
.. no queflion was ever taken upon it. With
refpeCt to the address from Maflachufetts, on
.. hearing it read, he himfelf expressed an opf
'e nion that it was written in improper language,
and reque/led it might lie upon the tabl&till
c next day, but the question was immediately
taken upon it for a reference, and carried. He
afterwards examined the address, and found
that if he had heard it diftinClly he fliould not
have opposed the reference, though he dis
approved of its sentiments. But the gentle
man from Pennsylvania fays, Congress are
undertaking to force tliefe petitioners to give
t up an opinion. It was aftonifiling that men
i{ j who know the ufc of language fliould so dis
tort the meaning of words. When the IJoufe
fays it will not take thisaddrefs into confidÂ«r-
[VoLUMQ XIII"
ation, that they will not examine a libel iijg
on themselves, nor be the vehicle of their own
calumny, was this using force ? This ad
dress, Mr. D. said, does not speak of the ge
neral tendency of measures, but charges men
high in authority with faithl'efsflefs, with put
ting falfe confirmations upon dispatches for
the purpose of involving the country in war
with France, find in order to produce an alli
ance with Great-Britain. Language has 110
meaning, if this be not the purport of this ad
drefsj and were the House to (it and deter
mine whether thele charges are true or fall'e ?
Where is the man who wants testimony on this
head ? Which of us, said he, wants teftiino
ny to prove himfelf a traitor, or otherwise ?
Yet this is insinuated to be a duty. Let thole
whe chufe it, deliberate on such matter, he
himfelf could not consent to it.
Mr. R. Williams wondered the gentle
man from Pennsylvania (Mr. SitgreavesJ
should have thought it neceflary to press a
discussion of this kind upon the House at this
late period of the feflion. As the memorial
from Malfachufetts, an extraÂ£t bf whichthey
had heard read, had been referred, he could
fee no reason why this fhbuld not be referred.
All the difference he saw betwixt them was,
that this deals in general terms, and that from
Massachusetts expressly charges the President
with improper conduct. It is true this goes
on ft pass a libel upon the British govern
ment, whilst that from Massachusetts does
not. Why, then, are not both treated alike ?
Does the circumltance of one being from
Eastern, and the other fiom a Southern state,
ma*ke any difference? Gentlemen ought to
consider, especially those who talk so much
about the people being united, and rallying
round the standard of government, what this
led to. Did it tend to produce that unanimi
ty which all must wifti to fee? No, it tended
to widen the bleach, and to shew to people in
one part of the country that they were not to
be treated in the fame way with others. If
citizens were to be at liberty to address the
House in one way, they nVuft be equally at
liberty to address them in a different way; and
yet the objections to the present addrels mult
be to the sentiments which it contains; for he
was of opinion with the gentleman from Vir
ginia (Mr. Brent) that citizens could not use
language more proper to convey the fame feri
timents. This opposition went to lhew that
addreflTes might be expressed in as strong terms
as could be used, if on the right fide \ but if
not on that fide, the petitioners mult he very
cautious indeed in the choice ot their words.
Mr. W. could not help remarking upon
what was said on the subjeCt of Party. Party,
he said, in that house, where it
ought to be checked. The citizens of this
country are not so divided as gentlemen sup
pose. Here it is firft started, and he was per
suaded the people of this country look with
astonishment at the divisions which take place
here, and of what was said about their being
divided. âHe did not fee how gentlemen could
apply what was said in the Memorial of per
sons high in office, to any particular members
of this house, or to any particular persons in
the Government. There was no way of doing
it but by conjecture. There may be men high
in office under the State Governments, which
are the persons alluded to. At any rate, it
was wrong, where more than one conftruftion
could be put upon a paper ot this kind, to
put that upon it which would operate molt
unfavourably upon the fubferibers.
Mr. W. concluded with faying he did not
approve of all the fentimentscontained m the
address ; but as he had before said he did not
know how the fame sentiments could have
been exprefled better. His feelings had been
frequently hurt by sentiments sent to this
house in,addrefles, but as lie believed to at
tempt to remedy the evil, would introduce a
greater, he was content to let the business
Hand as it does. He hoped the address would
be referred.
Mr. Brooks said, that notwithstanding a
great deal of time had been expended on this
fwbjeft, he mult beg to add a- few words.
Gentlemen in favour of this motion seemed
not to distinguish properly betwixt the ex
preflions in this addreis and others. A paral
lel had been drawn betwixt this address and
one from MassachusettsâMr. B. shewed
wherein they essentially differed.
Much had been said about a loss of time.
This he said was a dale argument. If this ad
â¢ dress was fuffered to be referred, nothing
could be so grofsand scandalous, but it might
be received. He did not expert, above alt
other members, that the gentleman from S.
1 Carolina (Mr. Harper) would have complain*
' ed of a waste of time : that gentleman, here
tofore so sensibly alive to character, had to
day astonished him.
i Mr. B. ridiculed the idea that by persons
> high in office, eeuld be meant any persons in
1 the State Governments or ii\ the Judiciary.
> It was written so plain, he said, " that he
: who runs may read." It was clear that these
â  addreflers mean to cast a censure upon the
: Executive, our Conjmiflioners, and both
i lioyfes of the Legislature, in refpeii to the
: dispatches alluded to.
I Mr. Gallatin proceeded to notice the
I obje<stions which had been made to a reference
- oftljisaddrefs. His colleague (Mr. Sitgreaves)
J said it.was misrepresentation to fay that gen
: tlemen were opposed to the reference of this
f address Qn the ground of its advocating opi
nions in opposition to those which they enter
t; tained, as it was merely on account of the in
, decency ot its language ; and in order to thew
i the indecency of language of which he spoke,
i he laid his arguments against the fubjett mat
- ter of the address. -Another gentleman ob
> jeded against it because it asks for nothing ;
- he believed it asked for much the fame as all
s the addretfes which were daily received con
r taining pledges oflives, fortunes, See. iivfup
, port of Government. The gentleman from
~\ Connecticut objected to a reference, because
1 it was seditious, slanderous, and calculated to
t disturb the Government. He did not kno.y
n what was the precise meaning of these words;
i and he believed not two gentlemen on this
- floor could agree as to their application to any
, special cafe. A gentleman from S. Carolina
1 (Mr. Rutledge) objects to the reference, be
y cause the address casts blame upon our Com
e miffioners, and may involve them in difficul
d ty. He did not believe there was any thing in
Â»t the proceedings in question which could be
- fuppoled to have relation to our Commiflion
- ers. No idea of the dispatches having been
e fabricated was to be found in that address.
e The only idea on on this fubjeft was a doubt
n whether the conversations of X, Y &Z, werq
- authorised by the French Government.; btff
e not a word was said on the authenticity of the
- dispatches, or of tjie conduct of our ComijHffioners. On thfc contraryj they fay they draw
their corcltifions. from the face of me dis
patches thenifelves. Other gentleinerf lay
their stress of dbjection agiiuft, the address,
because it arraigns the motives of Govern
ment. All agreed rhat it ought not to re
ferred, biit gentlemen gave so many, so dif
ferent, lo contradictory reasons of their opini
on, that it was impoflible for themselves to
define what kind of petitions they would per
mit, and which they would object it.
But of all the reasons which he had heard
afllgned against the reference, one given by
the gentleman from MafTachufetts (Mr. Otis)
was. the molt singular. It was thrft if this Ad
dress was referred it might confirm an idea that
we are of opinion that great part of the con-
Verfations held with our Commilfioners by
X, Y & Z, were not authorized by the French
Government. And if this should be the cafe,
what does rhat gentleman suppose will be the
result f The great danger to be apprehended
from this is, rhat the Executive Directory
will the conduct of its Agents. As
tohimfelf he (hould not consider such a dis
avowal as a misfortune. He wiihed they might
d'.fmifs their Vliniftersas corrupt, and prove
themfclves not to be To. It was very immate-,
rial to this country whether the Directory
were corrupt or not, whetherthey were impli
ed in X & Y's business or not: but it is of
great consequence to preserve peace,
therefore very important rhat they fhoulddif
avow all those proceedings. He hardiy could
have believer! that any gentleman should
have thought ; t a misfortune to this country,
that the French Government should fay they
do not want money from us, but that they are
ready to treat upon reaionabie terms, unless
indeed jhey conceded an accommodation
with France to bean unfavourable event. But
he believed nothing that Congress could do
now could produce any such effect, as
they could learn what was now done, they
would be informed of the publication of the
dispatches. He hoped the proceeding of these
' Agents would be disavowed. If he were to
express an opinion upon the subject, he
would fay, that he did nor believe the propo
sition respeCting a k loan of money would be
disavowed ; but he believed the Directory j
would disavow all rhar relared to (foments.
But if any means which Congress could take
would lead them to disavow the whole ; if to
refer this petition could contribute to pro
duce that effect, it would with him, and he
trusted with the house, bean additional realbn
to vote in favor of the reference.
â¢ Mr. Rujledgf. wished to add a few words
with respeCt to the document from theflate of
Mallitchufetts which had been introduced by
the gentleman from N. Carolina, as equally
indfcent with the proceedings whose reference
was now objected against. When the gentle
man read 11, he saw nothing in it analogous
to the present cafe. He therefore supposed the
gentleman had omitted the part which was in
point, and he had himfelf recourse to the pa
per. This address, it is true, calls in question
the propriety of an order erf the Executive ;
but there was no impeachment of his integ
rity, and it could not be said that it was in
decent or improper to disapprove of any aft
of the Executive. There v\ as nothing, there
fore, to juftify the comparison, since the Mas
sachusetts address merely fays, that the ad
drellers looked upon the order to reftritt the
arming of Merchants vellels as a wife measure
and the repeal of that order as unWife. -But
tiie proceedings now before the house charge
the Government with duplicity ; with having
given a falfe colouring to the late dispatches
of our Envoys. And *hy are they said rohave
done this ? In order to widen the breach be
tween this Government and the French Re
public. 1 hey fay that persons high in autho
rity have done this. But the gentleman from j
N. Carolina fays they have named no person. j
But had,men a r ght to fend abroad such abuse
as this, where every o;ie mult know who is
meant as well as .f the charge was direct.?
Certainly they had not.
Mr. R. said, if it ceuld be fhew'n that any
thing equally .ndecent with this was ever re
ceived by the house, he would not object to
the referring of this paper; but until this
was done, he ninfi pertift in objecting to re
ceive what appeared to him to be. drawn up
with a Ifudied contempt for Government.
A loud call for the queltion.
Mr. Allen said, he would just state before
the question was taken, that the reason which
led him to object ro a reference of the Memo
rial of the members of the Legislature of
Pennsylvania, on a former occafxon, was, be
cause it purported to come fr m members of a
Legislature, though it was ligned by them af
ter the fefTion was broke up.
Mr. Gallatin said, the gentleman was
wholly mistaken, for the Memorial was signed b
uhilft the house was in feflion.
The question for referring the proqeedings
was then taken by Yeas and Nays as follows ?

\ ADDRESS:
e Totmi PRESIDENT OF TUS UNITED STATE.Â®.
Sir,
y THE Commander in f'hief, the General
. Officeâ¢, the General S'affand Pieid-Offi
f cers of the Militia of flie State of New-
Jffey, feel, in common witS their numerous
â  fellow-citizens who have addrefled yon in

> and mod cordially join them in exprtffing
y to you their high approbation-os your eon
; dust in the management of its foreign con
s ceins, and their indignation for the insult
offered t i the honor and independence of
( the American people.
, We come not, Sir, to dilate Whether
, peace can be preferred with the fafety of
; our national digni y, or whether an appeal
: is to be made to arrrs, are questions en
' trulied to those in whose patriotism we eon
fide, and according to their decision we
(hdll always be p epared to aft. B\it, Sir,
at this eventful period, wt deem it our duty,
and !eel it a pleasure, refpefl'ully to ap
proach oiir Commander in , Chief, and to
make him a folemh proffer of our lives and
fortunes in the fcpvice of our country.
It is not, Sir, for soldiers to boait; but
we know the troops whom wc have the
honor to commaÃd ; we have been eye-wit
nefles to their ardent zeal in the cause of
freedom ; we have been their companions
in many toils and many fufferings ; and if
our beloved country calls, we (hall again
call the eye of confidence along their em
battled ranks.
L.et our enemies flatter themfclves that
we are a divided people. In New-Jersey,
Sir, with the exception of a few degraded
and a few deluded chara&ers, to whose per
for.s and to whose ftrviccs the invading foe
(hall be welcome the moment of their arrival,
and whom we engage to convey in fafety to ,
their linesâin New-Jerfjy, Sir, there is
but ONE yOICE, and that is the voice of I
confidence in the federal government: the
voicd of pcrfeft fatisfaflion with your admt- '
nidration of it ; and the voice of flrmnefs '
and determination ro support the laws and
<tonft<tution, the honor and dignity of thÂ®
United States ; and, Sir, for the defence
of thrfe, we do this day, in the presence of
the God of armies, and in firm reliance on his .

S Oedtlemen,
AMONG all the numerous addresses
_ which have been presented to me, in the
- present critical situation of our nation, there
has been none which has done m<! more
honor, none animated with a more glowing
= love of our country, or expreflive of fenti
an ments more determined and magnanimous,
lie Ihe lubrniilion you avow to tht civil au
jy thority, an indispensable principle in the
n- character >i warriors in a free government,
n- at the fame moment when you make a
solemn proffer of your Lives and Fortunes
'3, in the service of your country, is highly
v- honorable to your difpofitiens as Citizens
and Soldiers, and proves you perfe&ly qua
lified for the duties of both charaQers.
Officers and Soldiers of New-Je fey have
as little occasion as they have disposition to
al boad. Their country has long boaded of
n- their ardent zeal in the cause of freedom,
'â  ?nd their invincible intrepidity in the day of
is battle.
n Your voice of confidence andfatisfaflion,
> of firmnefs and determination to fupps.t
g the laws and constitution of the United
i- States, has a charm in it irrefidable to the
I- feelings of every American besom ; but,
!t when in the prtfence of the God of armies,
f and in firm reliance on his protection, you
solemnly pledge your lives and fortunes and
r your sacred honor, you have recorded words
f which ojight to be indelibly imprinted in
' p the memory of tjvery American youth
- With these sentiments in the hearts, and this
- language in the mouths of Americans in
e general, the greated nation may menace at
, its pleasure, and the degraded and deluded
, charafters may tremble left they fliould be
- condemned to the fevered punilhment an
J American can fufferâthat of being convey
-1 ed in fafety within the lines of an invading
enemy.

A large number of the mojl refpeflable citizens of t

reported the following resolutions, they Were 1 1
after being twice read manimoufly adopted. 1 ,
This meeting taking into confidcration that'
it is equally the duty and inters!! pf those who |
have the happiness to live under a government | f
so free and equal as that of the United States, to ; ]
be ready on ail occasions to aid and fuppnrt it ' a
and deeply fenfcble of the critical and embarralT- ; .
ing lituition to which our country is reduced by j Â®
the lawless aggrefiiona in the firft instance and ' e
in the fecondV by the insulting and obstinate re- ' Â£
fufal of the French guvernment to liflen to over- *
tqres for an amicable accomodation of the dif
puie fublifting between the two nations, under b
the falfe and degrading opinion that the people J
of this country are divided from and will not j-,
support the government of their own choice ;
anxious to refute this charge, and as far as we D
are able vindicate the rig Jits and honor of our
country, we have thought it our duty to come
forward andexprefs our fentitaents in the most
solemn and public manner and do therefore,
unanimously resolve,
ift. That in affirming a neutral position at the
commencement of the war in Europe our gov
ernment evinced the founded political discretion
and consulted the bwft interests of the country:
And as the measure i* itfelf was wife and pru
dent, so the means which have been employed n
for continuing to us its benefits have been judi P
cious, just, and impartial, so much so that in all c
the new Sc trying conjunflures which have been v
produced by the clalhing intereds, intrigues and f]
lawless dispositions of the belligerent nations
(and which were of a nature to create infinite Â°
difficulty and perplexity Jit is a fubjeil of just a
and grateful exultation that we are not able to
discern any trait, in thefyltem that has regulat- a
ed our foreign relations, that can justly be made
the fubjedl of censure at home or complaint d
abroad. ] (
2d. That the President of the United States 1
in his inftruiftions to our Envoys to France man
ifefted in the llrongeft and moll unequivocal
manner, his own and his country's attachment
to peace, and the sincerity of their wilh to re- t(
(lore harmony and a liberal intercourse with that
nation and that while we regret the failure of h
his efforts and thble of the amiable and eftima
b e charaHers who have sustained their million .
with fe much propriety and dignity, and depre
cate the consequences that may lefult, wÂ» are
consoled for the humiliation which our country
ha'i fullered by the refleilion, that it will add to
the unanimity which already pi evails among Our ui
citizens, andbring into aiSive ex'eition thatssp- t ]
rit and energy which are neccfiary to the defence
of ouf rights and fovercignty, and which h*ve
too long been repressed.
3d. That entertaining the fullefl confidence al
in the talents, firmnrfs, fidelity and patriotism,
which have so long and so highly dillinguilhed p;
the chief magistrate of the union, the most pÂ«r.
leiSl reliance on the wisdom and patriotilrn of
the Senate and of the House of Reprefei tatives
of the United States, and grateful for the diftin
guilhed advantages and happiness we enjoy in a "
country, and under civil inftitutiens the best in fi l
the world we cheerfully pledge ourselves to fe- T
cond and support, with nur utmost efforts, and m
at the hazard (if necelfary) of our lives and te
dearest intere'ls, all such measures as our gov-
ernment lhall adopt for the interest and fafety of
our country the ailertion Â»f our rights, and the P*
maintenance of onr national dignity and felf
government. th
4th. That our silence heretofore on the great he
and interefling questions which have at different ha
periods occupied the public mind, his not pro- f a
ceeded from an indifference to the fate and for
tunes of our country but has either been the ef
fedl of doubts as to the propriety of any inter- T "
ference on the part of the conilituent body (ex-
cept sq a conllitutioaal way) is being liable to Ti
>1- grow into a familiar praflice and be abused, or
he public avowal of our sentiments was deen)-
tj ;d fuperfluous j those of the people of this 'dif
riiU being at all times so truly reprefenteil in

And lastly, it is refolved, that
copies of the proceedings and resolves of this

Of the President of the United States to the <
e Address signed James Kent, Chairman, 1
' published in yesterday's Gazette.
' To tht ci izens of Queen Anne's County, ;
' in the State of Maryland.
GENTLEMEN,
s Your address to the President, Senate,
1 and House of Representatives of the United '
States, has been piefented to me by one of
your Senators, Mr. Lloyd, and one of your
1 representatives, Mr. Hindman.
' I thank you gentlemen, for the public de
| claration of your opinion of the inftruflions |
of the Executive authority of government j
1 to our Envoys.
Threats ihoAld not have been employed '
> by Frenchmen, to move Americans, whom '
they ought to have held in more esteem and
respect.
Whenever we shall be compelled to un-
Iheath the sword, in defence of our rights, '
r the people of America who have neither in- ;
r : jured nor offended nations, or men, though j
1 greatly injured and offended themselves, may j
. with confidence appeal to the God of na
tions for the just ice of their cause.
1 I cannot with you consider war as the '
heavicft of human calamities; national cor- !
j ruptton and national incapacity for waV, ari-
I sing from effeminacy, luxury, avarice, vice,
or frivolity, are much more to be deplored, '
as one half of Europe at lead, demonstrates
at this hour.
Your heroic declaration in concord, with 1
so many others, that if war cannot be avert
ed, by measures confident with national hon
or, you are ready, at the expence of your '
lievs and fortunes to defend those rights,
which your fathers and yourselves contribu- '
ted to cdablifh, is a gl rious proof, that !
Americans, are not depraved or degraded, 1
, but are dill worthy of thecharafter of the \
i firft of men.
) I cannot profefs my attachmeut to the'
prirciples of the French Revolution, until C
1 I know what they have been,and what they r
are. An anxiety for the eftablilhment of a c
government in France, on the basis of the c
: equal rights of mankind, as far as such a
; govtrnment is pratticable, I feel in common
with you.
That country however which gave us 1
birth, and in which we live, and hope to x
die, is entitled to our anxiety, exertions and v
facrifices in preference to any other in the u- 1
niverfe. JOHN ADAMS.

LONDON, April to. an
The state of the eleftions in France is qu
the mod important feature in its internal
situation which the lad papers exhibit. th
The Direftory for some time pad have th
made the ele&ions a principal objedl of at- to
tention, and have spared no pains to lead wi
the public opinion in such a choice of re- of
prefentatives as might secure them from Pc
the oppofttion they had to encounter from
the new third lad year. It does not appear, th'
however, that all the proclamations they wl
have issued, have been of much avail. As
far as thÂ«y have proceeded, the eleflions, in E;
many places, have been tempeduous and di- ob
vided. In many of the primary afiemblies pe>
the most violent contests have taken place.
The charafer of the ele&orial assemblies, dil

t j, at In consequence of these appearances of
f this opposition, the direftory have publilhed a
John new proclamation, in which they remind
icfore the public that the legislative body has the
epre- power of judging the operations of the elec

April 11.
The gigantic plan of aggrandizement
which the French have formed in the East-
I ern part of Europe, and in Asia, which we
'; long ago announced to our readers, begins
' to develope itfelf; a scheme of more extent, I
'' j both in point of territorial and commercial '
advantage, was never formed either in the
! antient or modern world ; and we fear it is
ited ' aS P ra Â® ,ca b'e as '' ls magnificent. It will
_ be found that it forms one of the secret ar
'our tides in their treaty with Austria, and that
the Sublime Porte, who they have both
terrified and cajoled, will be finally the
; s i victim of their inordinate ambition.
Â£nt | Their project is clearly to get poffefiion
j of the GrÂ« k Islands, which may serve them
j i as a nursery forfeamen, at least for the na
-1 viVation of the Mediterranean and Levant,
10m . 0 .
to receive permiihon to attempt again the
ancient plan of openi g a canal into the
un Red sea, from which they are not to be de
its terred by the failure of every firmer eMer
. ' , prize of the kind. The improved date of
, : engineering gives them hopes that th'ey will
Â° j conquer every obflacle that nature has op
| posed to this design, and the grandeur of
the objeA will be flattering to the charafter
of the people. If they succeed they will
, or _ open to themselves a navigation to the tiift,
arl -_ by a course so much (horter than the pre
sent, and will have such a demand for su
ed' ar ln E eyP 1 ' on coasts of all the
te S ' s eas Â°f which they will have the monopoly,
that their commerce must receive an enor

11 1 been in circulation refpefting the much talk

April 12.
Yefterda'y a cabinet council wa&held, at
which all rhe iftinifterg in town attended. It I
is conjefttirpd, that the objeft of the Coun. !
cil's meeting was to consider of the propri
ety of recommending a (reneral ar ing of
the people, by forming aflToc atitins in every
diftrift of the khirdom ; the .time of ex
ercise to be so appointed as to interfere as
little as pofiiblewiththe orcupat oils of those
who are engaged in bufintfs, but who are
still anxious to fliow their zeal in thedefence
of thf country.
Although this measure of a general arm'
ing has probably been long under confidera- 1
tion, we arc led to think that it has been
hastened by the account which, as we dated
yesterday, government has received within !
the last few days from France. It iÂ« not
merely at Breli and at Havre where the
preparations for invasion are in the greatest i
forwardnefs, but the fame aftivity is em- i
ployed ia almost every port of France and
Holland, from Rochefort to the Texel.
At Havre where the greateftnumberof gun
boats is building, the soldiers were called'
out of their beds twice last week, during
the mod tempestuous weather, to the exer
eife of manoeuvring with cannon in and out
of these boats, as if they were a&ually pre
paring to land in this countiy. This was
done, 110 doubt in order to render th' men
accustomed and expert to this kind of ex-er
cife, as well as to conceal the preqife mo
ment when they may really be called upon
to emba k on the expedition againd Eng
land. The bed information confirms the
opinion, that the French will endeavour to
carry their views into effeft by a coup-de
main. The powers granted to Buonaparte
as our readers will fee by the l?te arrete of
the Directory, are of the mod unlimited
aud dxtenlive nature, as he has the entire
command of this expedition both by sea
and land. The French have enforced the
requisition i;i Holland of every fifth man.
It is peifeftly true that his majeflyintends

an In the Diamond, with the Hydra frigate
in company, attacked these veflels, and en
gaged them for fevcral hours during the
night. The firing ceased about one o'clock 1
00 the morning oftlu- 9th. At day break
it was perceived that the gun vefiels had ta- '
ken Ih'elter i Â« the river Caen. It is not as- '
certained that much damage was.done to '
the Enemy though some of the officers of '
Sir Richard Strachan's squadron date that
one of the gun velfels was funk. It is suppo
sed they had troops on board. The gun vef- 1

By letters received from Lisbon by the last

the loyal spirit, so universally pervading the Bri

bly exemp.ified by their voluntarycontributions

momentous crisis prevails with equal ardor
amongst their brethren in Portugal ; where a

All the friends of the republic and of thecon
ftitutjon await with impatience the iflue of the
elections, which by renewing more than 420 '
members of the Jegifhmve body, must exert a !
powerful influence upon our destiny, Though (
they may be somewhat alarmed at the names Â®f
*ome of the electorsâthough they fearful
that certain fatflions may have succeeded in some f
of the primary assemblies, yet their apprehen- f
fions v,mifh when they attend to the harmony i
that fubfilts betu etn the legislative body and the t
diredlory, and the firm resolution which they 1
have txprefled, of indiscriminately excluding (
irom the bosom of the national representation '
ail those who moy borrow an infamous celebrity,
either from the revolutionary excefles, or from
the crimes of the royal re-aaion .by which they i
>vere succeeded ; it is therefore to no purpose
that certain ele&oral bodies (h uld be weak
enough to let rhemfelves be domineered over by
men who are in the habit of making every thing
yield to th&ir audaciousness ; they will only fuc
eed in depriving their departments of the ad
vantage of having deputies for this year.
The late proclamation cf the direflory fhouid
be the rule and guide of all the ele&ors who love
their country. We are afTured that it is in this
spirit that ahoiit forty electors of Paris have as
sembled and made out a lift of the candid ?tes
for the department of the Seine ; it b also said
that this lift was prelented to the directory and
received their approbation.

Paris papers up to rhu isth, were received on
Saturday ; but they contain nothing ot an inter- r
erting nature.
Yesterday the Hamburg mail due, arrived of t ]
course ; but it dors not bring any intelligence of \
much importance. The report in the French pa
pers, that the conferences at Kaitadt had termina
ted in a peace, is not confirmed, and it is extreme
ly improbable. Jn the contrary, (hould ali the j
prcl minary difficulties be removed, the arrange
ments of the various indemnifications which the 0
cessions on the left bank of the Rhihe would de- h
mand, mud be a work of much intricacy and de
lay. The articles from Raftadt fay little of the
piogref&of the negotiation, though it appears ra-
ther in a more favorable train.
The King of Naples is making every every ex
ertioa to prepare his kingdom to resist the French,
fhouid . they refolvc to attack him. The troops fc
â which the republicans have put in motion in Italy, 01
