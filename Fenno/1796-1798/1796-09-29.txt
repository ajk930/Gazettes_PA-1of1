To Charlm Yorke., Esq. t
Dear Sir, <
Do the above papers prove those crimes and cru- â¢
eltiei imputed to me by the Hon. General ? Do '
they prove any forwardnefs 011 my part to lift thofc I
dogs as a dreadful inftrumeut of war ? la it of any '
weight that not a drop of blood was (hed by those I
animals ? Those dogs were brought here at the in
(lance of the Genaial AfTembly of Jamaica, who j *
lent one of their own members to procure them, c
one of tUeir own (hips to convey them, and were t
at the fele expense, It is most jjrange that the use I
which the Spaniards made of bloodi,ounda%gaiiift v
the Indian inhabitants of the Western world, (hould y
be deemed by the Hon. General a cafe parallel to ?
ours ; the Spaniard* sent them for attack and rob- n
fceiy against the peaceful proprietors of those ceun- p
tries. This island has brought dogs, (not blood- h
hounds) for their own defence, and for their own 1
protection against a banditti, who had entered i>to I
a most dangerous and ungrateful rebellion. Thcfe n
Maroon savages pofleffeda country the most trtmen~ f v
dous, into which no European had ever dared to
penetrate. fetved la<t war-wt'.h eleven nations of 11
Indian ravages. Their dtefs Ss nÂ»t more wild and' si
fantaftic than thai of th> Maroon favagc ; but the "
one is a real character, the other is an aflumed one.
In war, a Maroon savage g#;j through his exercifc IÂ®
with his hair plaited, his fscc besmeared, and his Â®
body painted the colour of the ground or foliage ; 1Â«
he conceals hfhifelf ?when difcÂ«vered, he twists &
and turns, to avoid his enemy's fire, he throws his
arms ;n the air, with wonderful agility, and when tl
a represented falls, the children rush forward,
and with their knives close the fcenc. As it suits
their views, all thiols reversed ; they change with a!
their dress their ferocity ; they afTume the most ti
mild and most infmuating manners ; they descend a>
from their mountains to the plains, and mix with w
civilized society ; the proprietors of estates dare oi
not, however, refufe them any thing.they a(k." m
Looking at the country in a military view it is m
this: those Maroons pofleffed in the rear Â£
of their town, of amazing ftrengih, aÃd their po- b(
licy was foch as to deter all Europeans from ap- h<
proaching jt. This country is in the centre of the pt
island, and is surrounded by plains, which in the at
value of their produce and ccwifequenlial <ffeas, fp
D. employ 40 millions of British capital. To reduce p<
my argument as 1 would do a chart, by a penta- pi
ar- graph, the power of those Maroons was that of a â
â fort on an eminence, which commands the plains 1Â»
beÂ»QW it; that the Maroons underflood this, is evi- re
dent ; and the bolder lifter of a bold and noted to
ri- Maroon, on thefirftdaypf the rebellion, took the cii
of title of Queen oKMontego Bay. In attacking cc
I the Maroons in their diftri#, my fine of operation lh
, I wao more than twenty milts long, the last fix miles co
ns of which was through tra%and glades, of %hich
ral the military term defile can give do adequate idea; qv
ry and notwitLdanding our unremitted exertions, Kt ed
lie no time could vve bring up-a force nearly equal in ag
e_4 number to our enemy. Delay, to my opinion, th
is would have produced as fatal efFefls, and was as ed
p- much to be dreaded by us, as a defeat. Their ' of
ile skill and ability in planning ambushes made it im- in
n " ?Â°.â ,0 r *duce them by ordinÂ«ry means; our ed
-d (kill and ability ftartcd those ambuflies by extraor- mi
m dinary measures, measures juftified in the eyes of
Ht God and man. An inftuiment of war is in one trt
nt cafe fair, and in an6ther unfair. Why do the laws ve
bend.customs of war authorise a fort to fire red hot ed
as (hot, and deny it to a (hip of war ? The reafoa is ha
obvious : the one is deferrce, audlhe ot W aggrsf. th:
fion. It is upon that principle that I used the in- th,
ft rurnent mqueftion in Jamaica. It is upon that mc
that I h.v, refufed it in St. Domingo, I th.

x conduct we have observed may be quoted ngainft r.Â«
1- tn a rmii important way. LoiÂ«Â» Balcarres, ot fiie
if compeferof his Manifefto, has employed the
1- curious logic. In the firft place, conscious of the
e imp.opnety of that mode of warfare, he transfer.
1, the whole load of blame to the General Affembiv
y of Jamaica. He fay,, Â» These dogs were btouoid
- here at the inllartce of the General AlTcmbly, 1
Â» tent one of their own members to prbcure them,
, one of their own ftips to convey them, and were
il at thefole expence." I have not the least doubt
C ol the truth ot this afTeriion, but it should 1Â«
- known, that at the period when these docs wete
a sent for, the island was under martial law ; that aft
, the powers ol the Assembly were for tfe time M
' Â» p . e ~t ! ' and tbat the Governor was (hen lecaHr
c the dictator. But if he had neÂ«r Leen rivrtted
- with these extraordinary powers, 1* was {â two

s measure. He was Governor, and tLeiefoie had a

of war contrary to the received ideas of the law of br

ungenerous in the noble lord to throw the whole nc
blame on the Assembly, for it was his own aft as ov
Governor, contenting to that vote of alTembly, pc
and more especially his own aft, a*captain-general, cÂ«
â nd commander in chief Â«f the froops.âBut the
most extraordinary idea, in several views, which the ar
Earl has advanced, is, that it is perfectly lawful sis
and correct to use dot sin defence, and not in of- p..
â fence ; and that he himfelf would use them in Ja- th
roaica, but not in Stâ¢ Domingo ; that he has ac
tually refufed to fend tbem tu St. Domingo, tho' aÂ£
he had been offered the most advantageous subsidy ail
for these alliesâand a!l this is seriously dated as
principle. Sir, at this statement I can only smile ;
it does not admit of a grave answer, and his lord- d;
ftiips illustration of it is remarkable:âWhy," C
be fays, "do the laws and customs of war autho- V
rife a fort to fire red hot (hot, and teny it to a hi
ship of wari The reason is obvious ; the one is of
defence, the other aggrefiion."âl know of no o- vc
â¢ ther convention to this effect, than that which arises to
from mutual interest. If two (hips fire hot balta ah
Â»t each other, they rifl-c, beyond the common dan
, gersof eombat, that of perishing miserably in the a;
"flames ; ' therefore it is for their mutual advantage tr
to abÃain from that weapon. But a fort composed di
of stone and brick cannot fuffer from that fort of pt
fire, and does not scruple to bellow it on enemies in la
wood:.by parity of reason, Lord BalcarrM has
employed dogs against the Maroons, because he in
had the power to do so, and they had not. Thus p;
he has refolved'all the principles of right into that th
of power ; and has determined, as far as his ex- di
ample goes, that wherever you are enabled to com- re
*=â  mit injustice or barbarity, by means which the ene- p<
Nay do not possess, you are juftified. His lordship's hi
proportion, that " if any i.fthtfa lit?i âÂ»c-- rr
tually torn to pieces some bf our th
be should have had exactly tj at compunction which w
yourfelf might have felt, if a murderer had enter to
ed your gates, and was torn to pieces by your house ri
dog," does merit a little observation. Had the w
planters of Jamaica sent to Newfoundlander their ol
fine breed of dogs, to England for maft;ffs, or to m
the Spaniards for bloods-hounds, for the .purpose of ti
using them ls bouse dogs againfl'robbers or mur- b
derers, who could have blamed them i If one or cl
tj*o dogs had been planted in every house as a tl
guard, it might have been ah ufeful, nay, an hu- fti
nane precaution. But is this the measure of which ai
1 complained'. 2 , Â«
I will ilow make a better defence for his Lord- Â»
(hip than he has made for himfelf. The true state
of the cafe seems to be that the Planters~of Jamai- e:
ca, as appears from their history, have long wished b
to extirpate the Marouns, ?nd that they seised the ai
occasion of the present convulsion of principle, aqd t(
the present rage against liberty excited by crur Mini a
ftry, to effect their purpose,. in which the Noble (I
Earl, in my opinion, Vnofl wrongfully joined. It
perhaps might require higher reverence Â£or man as d
man, greater kriowledgu of the law of nature and tl
nations, and a deeper study of the philosophy of f
government than generally falls to the {hare of our S
nobles, to have enabled his lordship to have refilled v
the Assembly and the inhabitants in this dreadful n
leheme. 1 impute not inhumanity, to him, but t
tveaintfj, in yielding to the cruelty of men who
derive their riches and cotifeqiience from the misery -
of human beings, and 1 have bis own authority for
faying that it was not his aft, but theirs.
But a charge of a much more serious comphxion
now provoked by lord Balcarres and the Affetn
bly of Jamaica, than that which I urged in the
House of Commons. They have (hewn their ad
mit at ion of Spanifb policy and mercy, by the most
exact and complete adoption of them.âNot satis- '
fied with (Ã¼bduing and disarming the Maroons, a
free body of men, existing under the protection of
the Britifb crown and they have robbed
them of their lands, and have banished them from *
their native country, not individually, but in a mass; *
men, women and children. We have had debates
on the diffetent forts of exile, of which 1 think
there are three. Perfonsmay be ordered to quit a I
eountry, andTettle where they will : they may bo. i
carried to a particular place, and forced there to i
remain, but with freedom ;or they may be made 1
slaves.âThese Unhappy free Maroons had no choice 1
in the place or degree of their exile, and whether
they are gone to Botany Bay, the favorite destina
tion for those who flruggle for libett), I know npt.
Jamaica in this.tranfaftion has cOrrectly copied on
\afmall scale the example of Spain in expelling the
Moors, and certainly has not the iipology of serving
the fcaufe of religion.
It seems to me to be highly worthy of inVestiga
tion by the Legislature, whether our colonial Af
ferribly and Governors have the right of commit
ting f"eb an aft. It has now been exerted in a most
unjuftifiable degree, arfd may be a precedent for the
greatest enormities. If it is allowed that our Plan
ters, met in Assembly, have a tight to condemn to
banishment classes of free blacks, or coloured men,
there will soon not exist many free people in our
islands. Bhl I rather think that the Governor and
Assembly of Jamaica have in this inttaiice greatly
exceeded their powers. '
If your really great Ancestor, the firft Lord
Hardwicke, who certainly hac not much more as
feftion for the Highlanders of Scotlaftd than Lord
Balcgrrts seems to have for the Maroons, rrfft
ved to expatriate them all like the Spanish Moors,
he wonld not have enjoyed his present fame ; but he
was too wife and two enlightened to propose fiicfi a
n.eafurc. 1 haycAnittea more than I intended on

BRIDGE-TOWN, (Sarbadoes) Augull 9. j
An American vefl'el richly laden with the pro
duce of Surinam, and bound to Amsterdam, has
i lately been sent into Martinico by the Pelican n JÂ°
brig, which arrived here yeiterday afternoon from
a cruise. Thus does the waalth of the Mynheers
now furnifh a tempting boon for the vigilance ,of
our naval commanders, who have lately had an pp
portuSty of enriching themftlves with the spoils
o"? the enemy.
One of the Dutch priies taken off Surinam and
arrived at Martinico, is said to have upwards of
sixty tons weight of coffee on board; and it ap
â  pears that they are in general very valihble, all of
them having plate, specie, See. - Jol
No further accounts have been yet received of the JÂ°*
action mentioned in our la.l, bet ween tbc Beaulieu S' e
and La Hercules. â¢>
Augufl 20.
On Thursday last arrived in Carlisle bay, in 21
days express froai Rear Admiral Mann, Rationed off
Cadiz, his Majcfty's frigate Li Magicienne, capt.
William H. P. Ricketts, with dispatches of the
1 highest importance, as relating to the probability
i of a war with Spain ; which his Excellency the Go
â  ver has officially notified to the merchants of this
s town, and which we have full authority t* state as
i above.
On the arrival of the frigate, there was as usual,
: a great variety of reports in circulation, but fÂ» little Â«
truth attached to many, that we fhauld find much
[ difficulty in separating those even of probable ap
pearance bad we not obtained the following particu
-1 lars from a refpeftable source :
i Lord Bute, the resident Miniflerat Madrid, hav.
: ing seen with just apprehension, the formidable pre
-1 paratiorrs of that (court, advised Gen. O'Hara of
these hostile dispositions, who has immediately a
dopted every meafurt to place the important fort
â¢ refs (Gibraltar) under hi# command, in such a ref
peftable state, as to preclude a surprize, and enable
i liitn to deferd it with effect. A Spanish flset of
â  etghtrhe-4fne and fix frigates having about
, the some time, formed a junction with Richery,
1 who has been frrking blockaded at Cadii, ir.aking
together 13 of the line and 6 frigates, were prepa
â¢ ring to fail the firft opportunity for St., Domingo,
; with an intention as is conceived, of calling at some p t
r of the Windward Islands, or probably to invell Ja
) maica, having 5000 troops on board ; but that ae- a||
stive and indefatigable rear-admiral Mann, p
being apprized of their inter.!ion of failing, more
r closely blockaded the port, yet iliil apprehending
i the probable confequcnces to the Welt-Indies,
- (hould so fct midable a f&rce elude his viirilance and (o
1 arrive here unexpectedly, dispatched la Magicienne
w iih theCs important accounts, and from hence she
- will proceed to Jamaica with similar advices
: Among the various repoits on the arrival jof the
- express, tfÂ»e moll promjnent are that Leghorn has
1 been surrendered to the French, and Corsica evacu
: ated by the English ; and already if we gi*e credit
1 to the aceounts, has our naval force in the Meditter
anean made fevtral valuable captures of Spanish ot
e (hips- 7
t From the general complexion of affairs, f-arce a
s doubt can now be entertained ofa war with Spain ;
i theTelilefs disposition of the governing power in
f France, has been long aiming at this object, and j' c
r Spain unequal to combat with the internal factions f ;
i which threaten the exifteace of her arbitrary power fj 1
il may at length be (Vimpelled to enter into foreign hos
t tilities to preserve her domestic tranquility.
