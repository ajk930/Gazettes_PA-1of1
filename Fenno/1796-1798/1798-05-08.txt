C Â» [ '
f Concluded from yef/enlat's Gazette-1
Â«*- Mr. Harper callod for tTie order of the
to day on the bill for establishing an executive
J er > department, to be denominated The Depart
' Â° ment of the Navy. The house accordingly went
as into a committee of the whole on this bill,
and rose without making any amendment in
the bill; but upon the queltion in the houfa
ioft of its palling to a third reading,
Mr. Gallatin said, he had not proposed
k_ any amendment to this bill in the committee
hat the whole, because what,ht? had to fey up
t j on it, would go against the principle ot the
ar _ bill. He did not think it necertary to eftab
iifh a Navy Department. He did not suppose
pe- our army and navy were at present so large as
"elf to require two separate departments. If the
>n- business was so much increased as the persons
of at present employed could not do it, they
â¡t- might be increased. Nor did he believe with
some gentlemen that such an institution would
- produce economy. On the contrary, lie al
ways found that the increase of offises, was
theincreafe of '.xpence. Some time ago, it
was said that great economy would arise from
appointing a Purveyor of Supplies ; but he
had seen, from the time of this establishment,
be a great and confiant increase of expence in
ess everything which relates to fup,plies Not
in feeing the necessity of it, therefore, he should
vote again ft it, except good reason should be
given for it; for he believed, the moment a
te department of this kind was eftabliHied, the
head of it would wi/h to make it of as great
importance as possible by endea'/qurs to ex
' tend the object of his fuperintendance. He
called for the yeas and nays upon the question,
which were agreed to be taken.-
" Mr. J. Williams did not feeldifpofed to
vote for this bill. It appeared to l>ipi that
the Secretary of War,with officers under hint,
would be fufficient for the marfa'gemViit of
ir our naval concerns also. It was some time
w after the constitution was framed, beforp the
War Department was established' Whenever
_ an office was established, something was al ways
found for it to do. Soon after the War De
partment was established, we had an Indian
war, and after that Indian war ceafed,another
establishment was made under the name of the
Accountant's Office. If the business was in
creased, new clerks might be employed, but
- he (hould be againlt any new department. If
we were engaged in hostilities, and our naval
d power, of course increased, such an eftablilh
is ment might be necelfary ; but at present he
d did not think it necefTary.nor did he think our
k revenue equal to the support of a navy which
d (hould require such an efl.abliftiment to take
it care of it. Ifthisoffice was to superintend
; the construCtion of veifels, performs acquainted
y with this business, might be employed under
the Secretary as War. The present expence
of the War Department was 18,150 dollars a
year, and though there would not be much
to do in this new office, he supposed the Â»
pence would nut 'fco much lets, and bcfides
Congress would be importuned from session to
session to increase our naval force. Mr. W.
said he was desirous of making every defence
- for our country, yet he wished to keep down
our expences as much as pollible ; tfxjrcum
-1 fiances ciflcd for gohrg igniter into the bufi- 1
s | ness of the navy, he fliould not object to it. 1
Mr. Sewai.l said, when the house was 1
Â»confideriug any subject relative to the encreafe' 1
e ' of the navy, complaints were made of the 1
enormous expences, aild of the little refpon- 1
Ability which attends the business, and when ;
it has been said that the greatness of the ex
pence might have aril'en from a want of
knowledge in the persons who had the care of ;
the business, it was said that defect to ;
be remedied. This department is intended
to do that, and by the expence of a few hun- I !
dreds of dollars, he had no doubt thousands I
would be saved. When talking about vefrels, Â»
it was complained that too great an expense 1
was incurred on this objed ; now it is laid <
there is no object for ths proposed officer to 1
attend to ; but the gentleman from New- I
V oik (Mr. Williams) was afraid tf thisoffice c
was eltabliflied, it would he the means of 111- a
â¦creasing the navy. This certainly could nut t
be done contrary to the will of Congress. (
He thought there were obvious realotis for I
. the ellablifhment of this deparrment. It was t
well known that an officer might be well ac- f
quainted with the bulinefs of the array, with- v
out knowing any thing about a navy, and a, v
man employed at the head of such f
ment, ought to have some knowledge of the t
bulinefs committed to his care. MÂ°r. S. said.
â¢ however well the present Secretary of War h
might be acquainted with army concerns, he t]
believed he was not conversant with naval C
matters. In consequence of this, he had a h
number of agents employed under him. In- <r
deed the War Department had so much -bu.fi- ci
ness on its hands, as not to be able to pay a C
fufficient attention to our naval ertabliffiment. al
He therefore believed it jvas necelfary to make b
this new establishment, elpecially as the Naval 11;
Department was likely to be considerably al
augmented. w
Mr. S. Smith believed, after all the ftru"-- hi
gles which had been made 011 ih:s subject, Â°it b
would at length be foynd necelfary for the ar
United States seriously to turn their attention ni
to the establishment of an efficint naval force, <r (
and the sooner gentlemen could bring their in
minds to this, the better it would be for the ti<
general good. If this proposition had been in
brought forward at the commencement of the ce
session, he should have thought itunnecelTary ; nc
but from the increase which had been made cli
during this session, bethought the establish- Si
ment proper. 950,000 dollars had been ap- 011
propriated tor providing 12 vessels.a numberof ty
gallies were alio contemplated,a (hip of war or [I
(chooner, it appears has been-built on the be
-lakes, and some gallies on the rivers. These, ch
with the frigates and cutters,form aneftablifh- on
ment which will require a naval man to htuer- th
intend it. An expenditure ot twomillions of de
K !lC f "PP Q ' cd 'Â» would be authorized be
this session ; and a man knowing fomethin<* (he
of naval architecture, will be abLe to save ;
more in the course of this year to the United fed
States, than will pay ten years of the expences to
ot this office. A merchant going into the acc
building of veCTels, without a knowledge of ant
the business, will find the truth of this fait. int.
n.e great expenditure attending the building Th
of the frigates, he supposed, had been chiefly
owing to the want of such an establishment as b.ll
the present. The jentleman from New-York jwh
had ftatei the expence of the War Depart. pui
ment at 18,250' dollars ; but one half of that
expence was incurred in the office of the Ac
;S. countant of the War Department, and as
there would be no need of a new Accountant,
the expence could (lot be doubled. The.
duties of the War Department arejgr'eatly
increased, and might be farther i)icrÂ«Â£fed do
he ring the present session ; and an g)CM>fÂ»imire
ive of the kind proposed nYimm Mvv the thawing
Â«- away of thousands of dollai j. -v' '* T*'
:nt Mr. M acon said the favour
ill, of this bill were derived fro-.ri.-a want tff -know
in ledge of naval affairs in the War DcpftHment.
rfe He thought that might be supplied Without
the establishment of a new department ; but
ed he believed the building of the frigates had
;ee lnoftly been carried on under the direction of ,
p- the captains who were tp hjjve the coiftmand
he of them. More clerks had been added to the |
b- War Department, in consideration of the bull- I
>fe ness which the navy had occaiioned. He be- i
as lie ved the more officers were appointed, the'
he more money would be expended,
ns Mr. Otis said, the gentleman from New- '
ey York-had oppoled this billon different ground
th from the gentleman from Pennsylvania. He :
Id did pot make any reply to the gentluman from i
il- Pennsylvania, because he expected oppolition
as from him and some others, to every measure
it which had the defence of the country for
ni their object; and as the session was drawing
he to a close; he thought it belt to have as little
it, debate as possible, and that the foeiner the
in question was taken, th o better; but when he
ot heard a gentleman life in oppolition to it,uip
ld on whole support he calculated, he was ap
je prehenlive 1 eft it might have an effeit upon
a other persons on whose support healfo relied,
lie The gentleman from New-York seemed to i
at apprehend foms new and heavy expence Was
to be incurred, and that some greater caution
le was now necelfary than heretofore. What
11, saving, then, does he mgan to make by op
posing the eltabiiffiiiient of this office ! Since
to lie iuppofes the fame clerks v ill be ftiffijient,
it it will only be the salary of the chief officer,
11, which Mr. O. Cippofed would be 3,500 dol
ot larS ; a greater saving than which would be
le made by such a parson in every, ship built or
le purchased. Taking the expence of our naval
:r establishment at one million dollars a year, it
/Â»â  wouM only be an expence of one third per
cent, which every one mult allow was a mere
;n trifle to have the money of the public well
;r expended. The Cervices of the War and
le Naval Departments were, he said, perfectly
1- diltincf. The duties of the War Department
it became every day more arduous, and, what-
If ever gentlemen may think, they inuft become
tl more so. This opposition coming from a
friend, he could not suppose it arose from a
e bad motive, but merely trom a narrow con
ir ception of what is conceived to be the agri
h cultural interefl. Agriculture and commerce,
e said Mr. O. are twin filters, and cannot, live
d separate from each other ; they mull live to
d gefherj or expire Stthe fame moment. It was
r the duty of gentlemen representing agricul
e turifts thus to speak to their conditions. It
a was an axiom realized by every politician in
h the world. The faÂ£t was, that every thing
t- upon the Naval Department was so
s much saved, in which the agricultural part of
0 the country partake very largely.
Mr. O. said, it was necelfary even for the
e fake of appearances,, to establish aft office of 1
n this kind. We ought not only to prepare
- meaftrrrs of definite tiy Tea and land, bin in 1
doing this, we ou"ht to do it in conformity, 1
to the opinion of the European wdrld. He 1
s thought 5,000 dollars a year would be well
e expended in purchasing the good opinion of '
2 the European Nations in this refpect,and par- I
t; cirla'rly of t ranee. 1 1 hough our Ihite was I
1 at ptefenr that ot n:i infant, it would in time
- become that of an Hercules. f
f Even if the present (torm (hould blow over, v
t and our Naval power fhotjld not be wanted, a
> and the tneory of the' gentleman from New- t
I \ ork Ihould ovtrconie his theory, the elta
- I blilhirvent of this office could at any time be j (
1 fuppiclied, and the money expended in it n
, would be more than saved, by the additional
: information and care einploye,d in our Naval n
t concerps, as it was a thing impolTible for one
) aian to undertake the bufinefsiif the Warand e
â  Navy Departments. As well might a Mer- I
: chant be set to do the business of a l.awyer ; ti
a Law-yer that of a Phylician ; a Carpenter 0
: that of a Bricklayer, or a Bricklayer that ofa i
Carpenter. He hoped, therefore, as he had
heretofore had the pi ;afure Of voting with h
â  'he gentleman from New-York, he Ihould al- il
so have it on this occasion, whillt gentlemen n
who believe that no danger threatens us, and ft
, who are disinclined to take measures of de- tl
fence, may call the yeas and nays, and find g 1
themselves in a minority as qfual. " b
Mr. T. Claibqrk-e never remembered to a'
have heard such language as had fallen from it
the gentleman lalt up. He laments, said Mr. ti
C. that a gentleman who usually voted with d<
him (hould dare to think for himfclf. Are to
gentlemen's opinions and language thus to be w
circumscribed f [Mr. O. explained]. Mr. ai
C. continued, the gentleman was willing that 'h
all questions Ihould now be taken withput de- ta
bate. Does this mean, said he, that there art el
majority of members in this house who mud p.
always be in the right, ahd a minority al
ways in the wrong ? If this be the cafe, they fa
had better dismiss tlie minority, and do the he
biifinafs themselves. Were not gentlemen ga
any longer to exvrefs their difference of opi- th
nion > Would this be the way to keep the â Â»
government together, or to prelerve hanno&y ofl
in the country ? If" this were to be the fitua- an
tionot things, he should regret it with tears w <
in his eyes. He had himlelt no mathematical wi
certainty that any opinionÂ»ot his was right ;
nor did he think the gentleman from MaSa- thi
chuletts ought to expect men to bow to his. wl
Such an airumption led to mTchief of a feri- to
011s kind. What I to fay we have a majori- Tf
r : t, and , ,tlerefore w e will have no debate. 011
[ he Speaker said no such expression had jei
been made use of : if it had he (houfd have mc
checked it.] Had it not been for a'll exWiÂ®. be]
on of this kiliS, he (hould not have riftfn on rop
this question. He wifiied to Jiear every -"Aa
deliver his opinion freely. Mr. C. did not' wit
believe the bill to be a proper one, and he
Ihould therefore vote againlt it. tua
Mr. M Dowe ll said, he ihould be oppo- to 1
(ed to the bill, if he had no other objection are
to it than that it went to countenance the idea, and
according- to the gentleman from Maryland ?
and VfaUachu lefts, that this country mi\(t go nvo
into the establishment ol a large Naval Power, the
Ihe great (aving to be derived from this of- of
sice, he underflood to be from savings in the wh<
building of velTels, but as the twelve velTels had
which were lately voted, are proposed to be yea
purrhafed ready b'v.lt, he supposed this rea- and
tha* foil did not apply atfirfiftut. If these w;.?
Ac- no Intention, therefore (which he milted
1 as there was not) of carrying our Naval Kft-i
---ant, blifhment toany conliderable extent, heCould
Ihe fee iso occalion for the creation of this offictr.
at|y For if tin's Secretaryof the Navy was appohl*
du- ted, lie would alfoie obliged to rely upon o
tiire thers, in a gtcal degree, for information!
Â»;ing But the gentleman from Matfilclui/etti
(Mr. Otis) fays the eftablidunrnt of this lle
'our partment will operate as a defence to the

val Mr Harper said, the nnval defence
, it which this house thought necessary for tfie ,
per service of the country having been voted, he
eve could not agree with tliofe gentlemen who
/"ell consider this as a quellion of defence. He
ind thought it a queltion of economy, and in this
t!y view, he fliould reply to some observations

ive not effect with more speed and economy the

at These two departments, Mr. H. said, had
al no connexion with each other. No nation was
ie without two such departments, and our own
,d j experience had (hewn the want of a Nai.,-

Mr. W. said, \i lien he conlidered that al
mod everyday some new conltriiCTioli w â e j"
ther given to tlte conftit.ition, or some modi
of admmiftermg the government altered â¢
when they were told, that though such a thine
had been understood so a ltd so for two or three
years, it would bear a different conduction"
and now, when he saw they were about
[VclumM XIIEâ¢grthd department to aur government, not
â contemplated by the conllitution, he owned
he was alarmed. Whenever he saw
ness of the navy so extensive, as to requi.- a
ifeparate department, he should vote for it;
but he thought it would not be wife to go on
to the establishment of new departments, be
fore there was btifinefs for them to do ; be
cause, whenever such a department wascon
ftitutcd, he had no doubt btifinefs would be
found for it to do, as the officer at the head
of it would be continually drawing out, and
laying before Congress plans for its increase.
As to what had been said about the line of
conduct adopted by gentlemen in this House,
he should fay nothing of it. He thought too
much had already been said on that subject,
â¢nd he believed it would be best to fufTer such
reflections to refute themselves.
Mr-J. Williams said, the only point in
dispute was, whether* ieparate office should
be established for the biifinefs of the navy, or
whether it should be put under the care of a \
6uperuvtendant in the War Department. He
wished the gentleman from Maflachufetts
(Mr. Otis) ha<i spared his observations, until
he had heard thole of the gentleman from
Maryland (Mr. S. Smith). It had appeared
to him that a Superintendant in the War De
partment would have been fufficient, and he
yet thought so. He did not think the biifi
nefs tif the navy was so great as to require a
separate establishment. There was more bii
finefs in the War Department in 1794 than at
present, and nothing was then heard of a new
department. He should not have opposed
this meafnre if he had not been convinced that
every measure taken to increase the navy be
yond it* present establishment, would have a
bad effedlon this country. It had been pro
posed last Winter to purchase all the live-oak
timber in the Southern States ; afterwards a
proposition was brought forward for the esta
blishment of Naval Yards. Those measures
had been defeated, and they were now called t
upon to establish a new department for this fa- tl
vourite objedt. He was not willing to do it. (
The gentleman from Maflachufetts fiaid there
would only be a difference belwixt making a a
new office and continuing to do the business L
in the War Department, of the salary of the a
chief officer; but if he looked at the second j
elaufe of the bill, he would find himfelf mis- t
taken, as there was in that provision for a r
principal clerk, and such other clerks as he t
shall judge neceflary. So that he may have a r
clerk for every port in the Union, if he plea- s
fes. If he represented, as the gentleman from
Maflachufetts does, a commereial interest, he f
might be as faVorable to a navy as him ; but e
as that was not the cafe, he was opposed to it. t
He gave his approbation to such appropriati- t
011s as he thought neceflary ; and if, in this r
instance, he differed in opinion from the gen- r
tleman from Maflachufetts, he should (land
excused. He believed with that gentleman, ,
that the commercial and agricultural interests
were closely connected ; they differed only as a
to the extent to which it was proper to carry
olir naval defence. He did not wiih, however, ;
at present, to rejeit the bill. He believed it ,
might be amended, and he had no objection
to ihe question being postponed for that pur- ,
pose. 1
Mr. Livingston fa'd, he was almost ,
tempted to Imile at the arrogant pretensions j
of some gentlemen in this House, in their
treatment of others, at least their equals on ,
this floor, whatever they might be out of (
doors, being equally with them Reprefenta- (
t'rves of the People. They were told by the ,
gentleman from Maflach jletts (Mr. Otis)
that oppotition was expedted, was looked for
from certain gentlemen ; that no argument
was neceflary on the occation, thcifc
members who were opposed to all measures of
defence, would oppose this measure also ; but
that those who had originated the measure
would cairy it into effect. This fimpls de
claration of a strength of party was also at
tended with a very handfbrne rrtmke of orie
of his colleagues (Mr. J. Williams) for hav
ing dared to doubt the propriety of the mea
sure before the committee. He was happy to
find this rebuke had produced itseffedt, and
that though his colleague was at firft very de
cidedly against the bill, he yas now disposed
to doubt; and the effect of another rebuke, he
fuppoled, would obtain his vdte in favour of
the new establishment. for his own part,
neither the rebuke, nor the preliminary ob
servations with which it was accompanied,
had produced any effect upon him. He did
very much doubt the propriety of the mea
sure ; for although there was a great deal of
bulinefs in the war office, and the fame
person could not be supposed to be acquaint
ed with military and naval affairs, if a ship
builderwas to have the appointment, hecould
not think such a person fit to be one of the
<reat council of the nation ; and it mult be
recolledted that the person who holds this of
fice will become one of the counsellors of the
Prelrdent on all great concerns.
But if the idea was adopted, that no per
son in the government was to have business
under his direction which he does not perfedt
ly understand, thisdivifion muftnot flop here.
Could it be/aidthat the Sec-retary of War had
a perfect knowledge of every thing under his
diredtion, except what related to the navy?
Certainly not. To be so, he muftnot only be
a perfett engineer, but be acquainted with the
conftrudtion of arms. To carry this idea to
its full extent, it would not only be neceflary
to have separate departments, but alfoagteat
variety of liibdivifions; they muff have, he
supposed, coinmiflioners of gun barrels and of
ramrods.
But it was f.iid, that the establishment of
of this new office would be the means of sav
ing money, and the excels of expenditure on
the frigates was pointed at as a proof of the
want of an officer of this kind ; but he believ
ed if other business was looked at which had
been immediately under the diredtion of the
Secretary of War âthe frigate for the Dey of
Algiers for instanceâit would be found tp
have been well and speedily done, which was
a proof that the Secretary of War could attend
to that business.
It was said that this establishment was ne
ceflary, in order to give an appearance of de
fence to Europe, as if the establishment of a
Department of the Navy was to have the ef
fedt to do away all our palt and to prevent
future injuries. But our appearance to Europe
vras not all ; the example of EurPpean coun
tries was mentioned. All were said to have a
Marino Department. The pradtice of Europe,
Mr. L. said, had proved itfelf to be a bad
one, as the Nawies of those countries, had
proved the ruin of thrtn.
Mr. L. would raake no reply to the insinu
ations, thrown out against gentlemen, which
represented them as being opposed to every
measure of defence, as not a queflien came
before the house in which the fame
ed charge had not been repeated ; and he sup
posed by and bv, that a new Post Office could
not be proposed, or the most trifling business
done, w itlvout a repetition of those charges.

On motion of Mr. Harper, the house :
then took up the amendments of the Senate |
to the bill refperting the compensation of
Clerks.
Mr. Harper dated the effect of these
amendments to be, to give to the Secretary
of the Senate and the Clerk of, that house, an
addition of 250 dollars each to their present
salaries. He recommended an agreement to
these amendments as reasonable, as the sala
ries of these officers were fixed at the fame
time at which the salaries of the Clerks and
nferior officrrs were fixed, which had been
advanced.
Mr. Gallatin enquired what the present
salaries of these officers were. It wasanfwer
ed 1500 dollars a year, and two dollars a day
during the feflion of Congress. Mr. G. tho't
this fuflficient, and that since their salaries had
not been increased at a time when living was
much dearer than it is at present, or likely to
be, he could not consent to the proposed ad
vance.
The was taken by Yeas and Nays,
and negatived 36 to 28.
The following, being part of the proceed
ings of Monday, April 23, wereaccidently o
mitted in their proper course.
On motion of Mr. J. Williams, the house
went into a committee of the whole on the
bill for organizing, arming, and disciplining
the militia of the United States. Very soon
fter the committee was formed,
Mr. Otis wished the committee to rife, in
order to moi/ein the house, apoftponement of
the consideration of this bill till the next fefli
on of Congress. He was convinced that the ]
principle in the bill which went tp divide the
militia rnto afeledt and reserved corps, was a
good one ; but he did not think this was a
proper moment to make the new arrangement.
The bill contained, he said, a great variety
of detail, which would consume considerable
time to discuss, and after all, he did not be
lieve it would be got through this feflion. It
was probable, he said, that aprovifional army,
or foroe other arrangement, would be neces
sary for the present, in order to prepare for
any attack that may be made upon us ; and
ha thought it would be very wrong to disor
ganize the present system of militia at this
time, since he saw no good effect that could
be immediately produced by the change.
This motion wasfupported by Messrs. Skin
ner, Varnum, and T. Claiborne ; and oppos
ed by Meflrs. Shepard, S. Smith, R. Willi
ams, Nicholas, M'Dowell, and Macon. It
was negatived 3816 37.
The confidferation of the bill was then re
sumed and some progress made on it, when
â¢ the committee rose, and the house adjourned.
Thursday, April 26.
MR. D. FOSTER, from the committee
of claims, made an unfavourable re
pott on the petition of Alexander Power, at
torney in fact for Edward Bryan, and others,
soldiers in the Pennsylvania line, which was
concurred in.
The bill for establishing an executive de
partment, to be denominated the department
of the navy, was read the third paf
fed, 42 to 27.
On motion, the house again i*efolved itfelf
[ into a committee of the whole on the bill ap
propriating for the military establishment for
â  the ytar 1798 ; fvhen the question for filling
. the hlanV in the quarter matter department
. with 200,000 dollars again recurring,
| Mr. Harper said, it would be recolledted
, that when the house last rose, it was for the
t purpose of affording time to make some dif
. crimination in the appropriations. The gen
s tlemanfrom Pennsylvania (Mr. Gallatin) had
done this, and it appeared te him correctly,
f Mr. H. enumerated the different items, and
the sums calculated for each. Theveflelson
, the Lakes he had no doubt would be an use
. ful objedt, and ought to be provided for, but
! not under the quarter matter department. He
1 would introduce it as a diftindt item ; but he
Â» did not know under what authority the vessels
f on the Ohio and Mifliflippi were conftrutted,
p or for what purpose they were wanted. Per
s haps it might have been for the lower part of
1 the Mifliflippi, from the idea of a rupture in
that quarter ; but though this might have
been the cafe, he was far from admitting the
_ principle that the war department had a right
a to determine the propriety ef such a measure.
. He believed, if such an expence was neceflary
t an appropriation ought to have been made by
e Congress. He was therefore willing to drop
. this item altogether. It was stated that the
a conftrudtion of these vessels was commenced;
; he was notwithstanding willing that it should
d be suspended, until some enquiry was made
<f j into the business, and Congress lhall pass a
l la** to authorize the expenditure. He could
. ! not fay these vessels were not neceflary ; but
h he was willing to fay they should not be pro
y vided for at present. Mr. H. again objected
e to the expence of 34,000 dollars far the trans
portation of ordnance and (tores from this ci
ty to Pittsburgh. As Congress had no a(Tu
d ranees of these being wanted, he should be
- s willing to omit this item also. He wished
likewise to enquire whether ordnance could
is not be procured in that .country, without be
ing at so great an expence in transporting
them from this city.
( Mr. H. still wiflied the blank to be filled
with 200,000 dollars. The former eflimate
was isS,ooo dollars, but he believed it woulc
be well to appropriate the even fuin he had 1
named, as the average' Â»f the expence of the a
five la(t years in this department (:is he had
already (tared) had been 250,003 do.tars. rr
Mr. Sewul wished to know whether the 1
gentleman from S. 6*ii>fliia had had any con- t<
veffation with the Secretary t>f War rtfpett- ti
ing the vellels conftruiting on the I.akes and
the Ohio ? He supposed it was not expected w
that anadt should be paiTed to enable the Pre- ii
lident to replace veil'els used as transports, o
when worn out. Perhaps it might be necei- e
fary to arm these transports occasionally, as q
they were subject to the attacks of the likii
anS" â¢ n v 41
Mr. Ha R per said, he did not objeft to the t
vetrels on the Lakes ; he meant to propose a t
separate appropriation for them. It was to ~]
tbe vessels on the Ohio and MiffiHippi that r
he objected, which were not wanted for
tranfportatiton.
Mr. Craik did not think the committee f
were -prepared to fay these velfels were not a
wanted. He had so full a confidence in the r
Secretary of War, that he was ready to vote \
for all the items which lie had recommended, c
He wilhed, therefore, that the decision upon \
this'queftion might be postponed, until fur- r
ther information was received on the fuljjkct.
The rifingof the committee was advocated
by MefTrs. Craik, Dayton and Rutledge, and
opposed by Melfrs. Harper, S. Smith and
Gallatin. The question for riling was nega
tived.
Mr. Macon said, he was at a loss how to
vote on this fubjedl. Whatever sum was ap- .
propriated for this department, there was al
ways a deficiency ; it was not, therefore,worth <
while wo be very particular. j
Mr.'Gallatin moved to fill the blank
with 150,000 dollars, which was the sum he
had proposed on a former day, lince which, he (
laid, the house had received a number of ftate
-1 mrnts from the Secretary,of War, in order to
: induce a larger appropriation. As there
seemed to be a general concurrence ot opinion <
to reftritt the expences of the war dÂ«partment,
he wifiied some gentleirian better able to do
it than himfelf, would compare the number
of troops in service with the sums there re
quired. Mr. G. noticed a number ot ite-ms
which appeared to him anaccountably extra
vagant, and contrasted the very great expence
incurred on the north western frontier with
that of the troops employed on the seaboard.
M. G. also took a view of the expences un
der this head from the year 1789 to the pre
sent time, in order to shew that 150,000 dol
lars would be a fufficient appropriation.
After commenting pretty freely and at large
on the estimates from the War Office, Mr. G.
said, he believed there Was some radical de
feat with refpedt to the connexion subsisting
betwixt the Accountant's Department, the
Treasury and War Departments, which pre
vented a proper investigation of accounts. So
far as relates to the Treasury Department, the
accounts were always very clear, and there
was no ground of complaint ; but from the
connexion which subsists betwixt the War
Department and the Accountant's Depart
ment, tnere seemed to be a want of respon
sibility.
In the details which had been laid before
the house, Mr. G. said, he found items under
the heid of contingencies, which he should ne
ver have expefted to have found there ; one
was for the pay of an Infpettor of the troops
and garrisons of the United States at a salary
of 60 dollars a month. He could not fay such
an officer wis not necessary ; but if he was, lie
would fay he ought to have been provided for
bylaw. The other item was for a much lar
-1 ger sum, viz. for the pay of an Engineer of the
fortifications of the United States at a salary
of 3,000 dollars a year, which was a salary
greater than that of the Secretary of War. It
appears this Engineer was engaged for three
years ; but after he had been some time in the
' service, 3,000 dollars were given him over
and above his pay to relinquifb hi* contrast.
After a lew ornery aliens From M. DaSTa"
in favour of the Secretary of War,
Mr. Shepard rose and went over the dif-
I ferent items contained in the statement read
yesterday, particularly the boatmen, 13,000
dollars, the packhorfemen 5,000, the wag
goners 7,000, the labourers 3,000, the ar
mourers 6,000, the artificers 14,000, hire cvf
" ex pre lies 6,000, and fuel 8,000 dollars.
He could not tell how so many boatmen,
packhorfemen and waggoners could be em
- ployed (for it was not for boats, packhorfes
1 and waggons, but for the men alone); and
â  what so many labourers could be employed
in he could not imagine. He did not fee
why the soldiers could not do all the labour
e the army had to "'do tjiemfelves. When he
- was in the army, he was at no expence like
- this. And how the repairing of the arms for
, 3000 men could cost 6,000 dollars, he could
s not tell. Nor could he fee how 14,000 dol- j
lars could be expended on artificers. If we 1
- were to be involved in war, it would not do,
t to expend money in this manner. It was ve
" ry easy to write down 30, 50 or 100,000 dol
lars for this or that, but when the taxes came
f to be laid, the money would not be so easily
raised. Mr. S. palled overa number of arti
r cles, till he came so the fuel. He thought
r 8,000 dollars a year for fuel, in a country 1
t where the trees were ready to fall upon them,
was a very exorbitant charge. Whilst he
i was in the army, it never cost him sixpence
e for fuel. The United States had better pur
- chafe the land upon which the timber grows
- at once ; they would be able to get it for a
i much less sum. If these expences were to be
. incurred for 5,000 men, what, he afked,would
1 be the expence of an army of 30,000 men !
n This estimate, he was sure, mull be much too
- large ; and it became Congress to be careful
t how they gave encouragement to such charg
e es as these ; for the country would scarcely
2 be able to support the expence of any confi
s derable eftabliftiment, if mote economy was
, not used.
The question on filling the blank with
f 200,000 dollars was put and negatived, with
n out a division.
e Mr. Craik moved to fill the blank with
e 224,000 dollars, in order to take in an item
t recommended by the Secretary of War.. Mr.
C. thought the charafter of this officer had
y been very illiberally and very unfairly attack
y ed by the gentleman from Pennsylvania. If
p this gentleman had a'ifed improperly hemight
e be called to account, when he would have an
; opportunity of speaking for himfelf. [The
i Chairman said these remarks were not in or
e der : no such charges fud been made.] Mr.
a ,C. thought the observations of the gentleman
d to whom he alluded, mult have been so un
it derftood.
The motion of Mr. Craik not being fecond
d Â»d, it fell to tlie ground.
Mr. Gallatin moved to fill the blank
- with 150,000 dollars. He said, that with re
- fpedt to the integrity the Secretary of War,
ie lie did not doubt it in the lead ; as to his ta
d lents he had had no opportunity of forming a

The following is the answer cf the French c ]
minister Tieilhard and Bonnier, to the note j,
landed them by Count Metternich, by or
dei; of the Congress, relative to the ceflion ft
of the left Bank of the Rhine to the French h
Republic : ai
" The undernamed have received the note b
transmitted to them by Count Metternich. Q
and beg Jeave to return the folio winga-.ifwer: p
âThe Freneh republic, in the beginning Â£
of the felfionofthis Congress, has immedi
ately and frankly declared the basis upon
which peace can be concluded ; It is there
fore determined not to vary from it. The
jultice and necessity of ceding the left bank J
of the Rhine to the French republic has f,
been candidly set forth in the notes hereto- ]i
fore transmitted by the undersigned, in fl
which, they trust, they have also fully s
shewn that it will be for the mutual advan-
tage of all parties concirned. The French I
republic did not expe<S that so much artifice 1;
would be made use of in order to delay the j a
determination of thi* article. It is new in- (j
filled on to make an immediate declaration j
on this head.âThe Miniftets of the French ! r
republic,- therefore demand of the congress, j
to declare, whether they agree to this arti- r
cle of not, without loss or time. e

From the Western Telegraphe,
HISTORY is a narrative of divine Pro
vidence or God'sgovernment of the worldâ
'and the Jewish hillory as contained' in the
bible is the more inftru&ive as ths finger of
G >d is there constantly pointed ;out. We
read otherhiftories asmcn fee a puppet Ihowr
: ata distance.But in the bible we are brought
F near add as it were let behind the scene and
; fee the wires and springs by which all the
motions are directed. If we read the liiftory
or attend to the tranfadlions of any nation,
: wefhallfindthat all nations, like the Jews, are
t under the immediate government of God ;
. that their fateis generally according to their
- conduft ; that righteousness exaltelh a na
s tion ; but fin is the reproach of any people;
r that when corrupted by prosperity, they for
get God, he forfakes the m to misfortune ;
and that when awakened by distress they re
turn to him,he comforts and raises them up.
1 It is true he sometimes to accomplilh the
1 purposes of his providence gives prosperity
f to one guilty nation, m rely to life it as a
1 fcourgeon the fins of others. The wicked in
, great power spread for a while like a green
5 bay-tree. But it is soon cut off and forgot
r ten. It mayalways be diftinguilhed, whether
e prosperity is given by God to any nation
as a blessing or a carfe, by their spirit, tem
e per, and condu& under it. If they are hum
s ble, jnft, and reverential of God, we may
s expedl their greatness will be liable. If they
are iufoler.t, loppreffive and irreligious, de
- pend upon it, they are raised not for their
- own benefit, but for the calamity of others ;
and their deftruftion will be sudden.
France seems now to beinthis state. She
is Babylon, a golden cup in the Eord'shand,
e that hath made all the earth drunken of ljer
,s wine, therefore the nations are mad. A fire
- is kind ed in his anger and (hall burn unto
1- the lowed Hell, and (hall consume the earth
e with herincreafe, and feton fire the founda
s tion of the mountains. For they are a nation
y void of counsel, neither is there any under
-- Handing in them. Their wine is the vine of
if Spdom and of the field of Gomorrah : their
y grapes are of gall, their clutters are bitter.
1- Their wine isthepoifon ofdragons,& thecruel
venom of asps. Is not this laid up ia floro
js with me and sealed up among my treasures ?
h To mebelongeth vengeance andrecompence
their foot (hall slide in due time. for the dair
of their calamity is at hand and the thingi
that (hall come upon them make haste, For
f- the Lord (hall judge his people, and repent
ire himfelf for his servants ; when he feeth that
of their power is gone, and there is none (hut
e, up or left.
C' After spreading calamity over the half of
Europe, France comes rio4v to diflurb the
peace of Artie ica. As Alexander was ne
ver fatisfied while there was'any power to
ne subdue France, i; ncverfatisfied while there"W any happiness to destroy. We have iaiie
her no injustice. we can do her no igury,
we are free outfelves, and we rejoicedin her
freedom and ffionld yet cordially exult in
the permanent eftahlilhment ol a couftitu
tional Government, liberty, and happiness
in that nation. What hut a domineering,
spirit of deftru&ion could lead France to at
tack America ! We have tried every means J
of conciliation. She will not listen unless
we facrifice our happiness, our liberty, our
honour, our independence to her baft haugh
ty pafiions.
In this (late what should America do
What did (he do when required in like man
ner by Britain to crouch under tyranny ?
After all pacific measures are exhaulled, let
America set her confidence in God, and un
der his protection exert her means of ielf de
fence; A just cause and a fear of God
gives a confidence and courage which n>- (
thing else can inspire.âThere is a boldnefr
in virtue which fe<?ures success, when its
strength is animated by a trust in divine
Providence and favour. A bad cause and a
â want of hope and faith make the endeavours
languid- and the arm nervtlefs. Conscience
makes cowards of us all
The President of the United States con
scious of thejuftice of our cause, of the rec
titude of his motives, and of the sincerity of
his endeavours for reconciliation and peace,
lias piotifly determined to awaken the minds
of the American people to an 3ppeal to hea
ven, their true resource, their certain help
in time'of trouble, He has proclaimed the
9th of May a day of fatting, humiliation,
and prayer. If we mean to trust in the favour j
of God we mull cultivate virtue. And pie- |
ty is necessary to enforce virtue. Let ail |
friends to their country now in the hour of j
its distress turn their hearts to God :
we have a go "d caafe and in him we (Vail
find a true frie nd. Let the day be observed
accrrding to the proclamation. Even where
there is 110 minister or regular congregation,
let the people aflemble at their ordinary
places of worship. The quakers worship e
ven in silence. Let some of the most intelli
gent deliver their ferttimentson our condition
and our duties and let the others regarrd with
an attentive ear and a fiucere heart.
[Herefollows the PrefidenCsproclamation.]
These are the sentiments of true piety and
.exprcfiions of the fear of God. Let us now
turn our eyes to France : and we (hall fee that
"their Rock is not as our rock, "seven our enemies
themselves being judges.
" Hebtrt, a profeffed atheist, at the inftigi- -
tion of the execrable Condoreet, Jfet up the
Â«Â« Journal it Veritable Pere au Cbene."
This piper was filled with blasphemy, and ob
scenity of the grofleft kind, and was distributed
â¢with a most.pernicious activity.
" The blessed effefts of this patriotic print
were not long in manifefting themselves.âThe
people, accustomed to fee the religion of their
ancestors daily reviled, learned to ihink of it
with indifference, and soon became ripe for the
V Farce" whichCordorcet andhis atheistical as
sociates were preparing for them.^
" Gohet, the revolutionary oi(hop of Paris,
appeared at the bar of the Constituent Assembly
with his inferior clergy, and made a formal ab
juration of cbriflianity. He threw himfeff, he
said, on the mrcy of the nation, for having so
long deceived them with the ablurdities of the
im'poftot Pbrijl, and his pretended Father,jwhofe
dodlrines he now abjured with detestation and
horror j and he assured them, that in future he
would acknowledge no other deity than rtafon.
Here began the ccrennnv fÂ° much admired
by the Jacobin prints'. " Hebert kept a (trumpet
of the name of Mormoro, the wife of a rene
gade Corfican. This iniferable prostitute was
fixed upon toreprefent the Goddess of Keafon ;
. she wa6 fantaftically tricked out, and Ird at the
head of a grand procefiion, to the church of
Notre Dame, the cathedral of Paris :âhere Die
was solemnly placed on a throne of turf and
flowers, while Gobet, and the reft of the revo
lutionary clergy, burnt incense on an altar,
ereÂ£lÂ«d just before her.
i< While this was performing, the cannon an
nounced the inrtallation of the new Goddess ;
the enlightened people of Paris fell prostrate at
the signal, and paid their brutified adorations at
the feet of a street walker and an adulteress ! ! 1"
They wrote over the entrance of thrir church
yards, " This is the place of everlasting deep."
And so completely was it supposed that religion
wÂ» deflroyed in France that Robespierre thought
proper to propose a decree that the French na
tion believed in a God.
If we compart- the conduit of our President
with thut of the French government may we not
well fay that their Rock is not as our Rock, even
our enemies themselves being judges ? And if
we believe in a God and his Prudence can we
think that profperitv is to the French but
as a flourge to other nations* ;.that it will last
longer than chat end is accomplished ; or that if
we put our trt.ft in God We need fiar what they
can do unto u? ?
" Let the well disposed people of this coun
try, reflefl ferioefly on these paragraphs.
" Are they content to exchange rational liber
ty for anarchy, and the religion of their forefa
thers for atheism in its most horrid form ? If so,
they will do well to attend these zealots of infi
delity; these faithful copyists of the Pere du
Chene i they are the mouth pieces of tht party ;
and they speak to us in thunder.
" But we have better hopes: we trust our
countrymen regard their blasphemies with ab
horrence, and are well aware of the folly of
confiding in the hypocritical pretensions of those
men, who begin their patriotic career by rcqsir-
Ing in to renounce our peace here, and our hopes

GENTLEMEN,
I THANK you for the declaration of your ap
probation of the measures adopted by me relative
to our foreign relations, to conciliate the French
Republic, and to-accommodate all exilting differen
ces upon terms compatible with the fafaty, the in
tereftand the dignity of the United States.
Your high and elevated opinion of, and confi
dence in the virtue, wisdom and patriotism of the
national government, and fixed resolution to ftp
port, at tha risque of your lives and fortunes, such
measures as may be determined to be necessary to
promote and fccure the honor and happiness of the
United States, do you honor; and are perfectly in
character,
It niuit however be a very unnatural and pecu
liar slate of things, to make it necessary or proper in.
you, or in any other American in your behalf, to de-'
clare to the world what the world ought to have
knownandacknowledged without hefitation,that you
are not humiliated under a colonial spirit of fear,
that you are not a divided people, in any point which
involves the honor, fafcty and essential rights of
your country, that you know your rights, and are
determined tafupport them.

MR. FENNO,
As you were so obliging as to publish, some
d*ys fiace, some ftri&tires on those members of
Congrefr who have fled from their duty at a
time, of unexampled difficulty and danger, I
must request the publication of some further ob
fervations on this interesting fubjeift. Although
I could not flatter myfelf that any remarks I
have made or (hall make, would either recall the
fugitives to a sense of (hame & duty or prevent
the defertion'of others, yet f had hoped that the
perplexing and alarming situation of our coun
try ripening faft to some great event âthe embar
raffed state of public affairs, in a groat measure
unprepared for the serious state of things that
seems to tie rapid'y pi effing upon usâthe
indifpenfible necessity for wisdom, celerity amt
energy in our measures and provisions, and the
painful anxiety and uncertainty that agitates the
public mind would have had some influence in
holding men who hava voluntarily assumed pub
lie rrfponfibility, to the faithful discharge of
those duties and a faithful gnardianftnp over that
country whose faterefts in their fidelity. Great
God ! what shall we fay and think of men who
will desert fuoh high an I interesting duties and
leave their country to take its chance ; to (land
or fall as it (hall happen ; to be a prey to its foes
who are never cau;;ht napping, who never de
sert their attack on its prosperity and fafety, to
gratify fbmetrifling whim, to anlwer some paltry
purpose. Such men are more unworthy of public
confidence, are more deserving public indigna
tion than Gallatin er Giles, or the most invete
rate foes of the government. If we are ruined,
thefe mtn answer for it to their confcieuces
and tkeir country But can they not be com
pelled to do their duty ? Is it at their option to
leave us to definition or not ? Why do not their
constituents fend them back to ihe feat of iÂ»oÂ»
eminent with reproach and indignation ? This
must be doneâl would have them sent back like
the criminals they are. Do they not betray their
country âdo they not give her up to ruin ? And
is this, no crimeâno treason ? Tenfenators are
now absent with very little profpet of their re
turning, at leaf! as to the greater part of them.

Her commerce spread on all the seas ;
Her cities trade, her fruitful fields ;

But hark ! the diftnnt dangers, furc,
Her (hips assail, and threat, that peace,
On the Atlantic, as they roll,
From common foes,
Plunder, and spoil,
On sea, on land,
Expeft ; defend ; make haste.
Sons of Columbia, arise I
Your country calls, for war prepare ;
Equip your fleet, to arms ! to arms 1

Remember how your fathers fought,
With Washington the wife, and brave ;
Real independence, was the prize :
Given to you,

In life, 'till death ;
Nor yield it at the grave.
That Washington, atVernon's mo'int,

His Country still surveys, and loves :
His life, with their's,
In war he hÂ®lds,
As held in peace,
Devoted to their call.
Then freeman brave, mature in age";
And you, her rising, gallant youth,
With Adams in the civil state ;

Well play, to cheer, and please.

And tillage, with her sweaty face,
Will give us plenty for our toil.
While public good,
And household joy,
Will be the boon,
Of valor, love, and peace.
