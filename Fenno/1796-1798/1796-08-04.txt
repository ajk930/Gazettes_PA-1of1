Irom the Londtn Gazette, May 21.
is Extract of a letter from Adam Duncan, Esq. ad
1' miral of the Blue, and commander in chief ofhis
M.ijefly'j (hips and vcffels in the north seas, to
Mr. Nepeao, secretary to admiralty, dated
e . Venerable, at sea, May i(?, 1796 âafternoon,
it Texel, S. E. by Z- didant 15 leagues.
Be pie a fed to acqjamt the Lords Cotnmiffioners
ie of the admiralty, that, on the izthinft. at day light
(the Texel then bearing N. W. by W. distance
i- about 3 leagues) I discovered a frigate and brig
Handing fut<J th* fleet, making the private signal
to speak with me : they proved to be his majelly's
(hips Pegasus and Sylph sloop, whom 1 had order
ed tocruife oil the Naze of Norway. Capt. D'ln
nelly came on board and informed me that incon* 1
fcquence of the information he had received on the j
'I' Bth inft. of the Dutch frigate Argo and three na-1
u# tional brigs having left Flickeiod the dav beforr, j
.bound to the Texel, he proceeded off the Jutland
fn coast, and on the morning of the 9th got light of!
them. He kept near them all dayj but 101 l fight ) '
- of them about >10 o'clock that night: and judging j 1
it proper so make me acquainted therewith, diredt- j '
. tdcapt. White, "of the Sylph, to (leer a different
sourfe to himUlf in order to falrfn with me, and '
luckily tbey both joined. Having consulted with 1
capt. Donnelly, and found they could not be many
league* from us, I immediately dispatched capt.
Hallled in the Phoenix, together with tile Leopard, '
Pegasus, and Sylph, to pruceed to the northward of 1
the Texel, and fpreac the reft of the fquadren.â 1
All the (hips had just madt fail about 5 o'clock wlien
the signal was made for feeing the Dutch frigate '
and brigs ; made the signal for a general ch&ce, it
then blowing lirong a' W. N, W. with very hazy 1
weather. At a little beforeo'clock the '
__ w ;,|, Â»u- Â»..Â«cmnjpfcfc .v. ;g J
36 guns, and manned With 237 men, and, after a '
very fraart action of about half 411 hour (durtug 1
which time (he msdc every effort to get off) (he
(truck to the Phcenix'-s superior fire ; for the parti- 5
cularsof which 1 null beg to refer thetr lordships v
to capt. Halfted's letter herewith inclosed, who, '
I have the pleaftire to fay, has on this, and every'
other occasion whilst under my command, (hewn
himfelfto be a mod adlive, zealous and excellent of- '
ficer. i
WÂ« continued in chace of the brigs, leaving the 0
Powerful to assist capt. Halfted in ihifting the
prisoners', &c. At ioo'clock we fawtho Leander c
afid Pegasus near two of the brigs, (which we have 0
since found to be the Echo of i 8 guns, and the De
Geir of 14 guns) but it was so hazy and blowing
fÂ» hard, we soon loft fight of them: however, by
the inclosed letter 1 received from captain Donnelly
their lordships will be informed they wete bosh run ''
on shore neat Bafch, about ten leagues to the east- B
ward of the Texel. Â£
The Leandrr, I find flood as near the shore as ''
fhe'tould wi h fafety, and law one of the brigs a- P
ground ; and from the report of the mailer of one
of the cutters I sent on Ihore after, find one of 0
them was completely loft ; the other had beat over r<
a (Jioal and got to an anchor, but as it blew a per.
feÂ£t dorm the next on (hore, have reason .to be
lieve (he is loft also.
We flood after the other brig, and a little before
elevtyi (he ftiuck to the Sylph ; she proves to be h
the Mercury of 16 all of whieh except tvo in
(he had thrown overboard during the chace, and
manned w.th 85 meri. We then found ourselves ft
far to the eastward, with the wind on shore, which b<
obliged us to arry a press of fail, and in the flight F\
it came to blow a very hard gale of wind, which ti
continued the whole of the next day ; and the day T
following, being moie mo-Jeiate, was rejoined by
the Powerful, Phoenix, and Brilliant, together with
the Dutch ftigate and the Duke of York bye-boat
from Yarmouth to Hamburgh, which had been cap
tured by the Argo the day before, and re aken by
the Phsemx on the ! 2 th. The frigate is in excei
enrcondition, and in a few days might be got rea
cy for sea, and made a complete cniizcr.

ad CITIZENS,
I present you a final! work entitled, "Decay
to and fall of the Englifit Syltem of Finance;" jâ
tf( j which I have explained and brought to tlte
on , finance! ot your principal enemy, the Englilh RO .
vernment. If I have any abi : i y to judge of 1 lie
ier| circumilances, and by them, of probable events,
,| lt that Machiavelian government diaws near its e,.<l.
', ce The circumltances in which it now fends, are
,jg as curious as they are criri al, and quite different
n ,| fromanyothei.it hastier been* involved in; tin,
y' s inferior and formidable enemies who never had
| er . Ihewn themselves in any preceeding war, press it
now on every hde ; the one is the great and pro
on- jjrcfnve change of opinion, spreading itfelf widely
the j England, concerning the hereditary system of
na-1 government ; and ibis system has much more fallen ,
ire, : â Â° the opinion of the people of that country, the!*
lllc j four years, than it had done in France the four
o/i y ear Â» ? hat the French Revolution. The
,ht j other is Â» ,he discovery made at the last by the pub
inj, â  lie, that the system of Finance, by loans or conftitu
:Â£t. j ted rents, (funding fyllem) the only resource of the
; Englifli government in order to get the money they
lm | ate in continual want of, is nothing but a gover
-Ith mental fraud.
Ny In the preceeding war the English government
p t- was lupported by the superstition of the country
for, a thing which cxifU but in the name and which
| Q f they tall a constitution, and by their credulity in
their oam system of Finance ; from these two popu
lcn lar errors, it drew all its Brength, and now they
ste vanish, their refourcrs are e*bs.uftÂ«d.
; t When the Englilh government, that monster,
Z y the reiult of national blindness and maritime
oppretfipn.jj once overthrown, tbe *Â»oÂ»J4 will bÂ«
"j "TreeUirom the common enemy, and' the two nati
- a ons, France and England may depend,upon a reci-
UJ r procal fraternity and a durable peace.
h e \ The President " I announce to the council, there
t j. are deposited on the table two copies of that
p S work, one in English the other translated into
ia> French by our colleague Lanthcnas."
rv Tht honorable mention iÂ« called for.
Defermoat, "I aik also the honorable mention,
,f. but as tie work presented to us is r'eferving of fix
ing of all who are now about laying the foundation
[j e of a system of Finanee, and one of our colleagues
he has translated it into French, I move that the Conn
er cil order its impreflion and diflribution to every one
ve of the members.''
) e The propoli'ion is adopted.
