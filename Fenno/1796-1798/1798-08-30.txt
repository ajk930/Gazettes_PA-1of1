On the foltaiving que/ti n ' " Would it he eonsts
" tent ivit4 pftfiey and justice to prohibit the
" immigration of foreigners irtl* the Uiited

Princeton.
f Continued from yesterday's Gazette,J
But :hsiromigration of forfign artifis infco A
wertca has another and a much more impjrUOT
efTefl on our domestic msÂ»ufacflureÂ«. Evei'y ar
tist who immigrates into America, and every
implement of his irt-, or valujhle machine he
bring* with him, le'Tens the quantity of
neceflary to the practice of that art To prac
tise anv art yna mufl have laborers who knew
how to difeharge their rcfpeilive offices. Sup
pofiig that fu. h labArere can he procured, Che
profits of the capital with which they are em
ployed, will depend upon 'He price of the com
mn iities niÂ»nuf<ifnred, snd the exprnce necef.
fary to p'epa-e them for fa'e. It thepri e at
which the, produce of the m.inufjflory can he
difpoUd of he known, the profits will vary- with
the txpence in p-eparing it for market. This
ex; ence being composed of two par's âthe price
ef the whole labor ind of the giofs m teriaU
Upon which it is if tht latter he given
the profits of the manufactory will vz*-f with
the former, that i:, w.th the wages of the
workmen and their number; and this la ft ex
pend-, it is said, is too great in Ameriej to ad
mit of the efiahli'htnent of njirtjfj.'lofiesi I
have (hewn low the immigration of foreigners
reduces the wages of each laborer, the other ad
vantage I would wish to explain, is, its efFe-3 in
dimini!hm?the number of workmen engaged in
the cxeri ile of any art. A manufactory being
supposed to pr' duce a certain quantity 1 of mm
ufailured article.-. in a given time, with the la
bor of a certain i nrr.ber-of workmen praflifing
with a given devtersy, it is evident that if you
encreafe the desttrity of the workmen you may
dirj.inilh their number, and yet prt;>are the fame
quantity of commocii ies for market, (( r, if
yorf iuppofe i heir number to continue unvaried
while the j pra'dfife with twice thsir former skill
of new laborers, they will, in the course of
twelve m nthb, prepare double th quantity of
manuMcflutes. Thus, by auamemiig the dex
tery of the workmen, in the proporti >n bef re
mentioned, you double the gross inrflmebf the
m nufaflurer, while you increase his expences
only by the price of '.he additional gross mate,
rials cnnfiim din the wrklhop A fniilar ef
fefl is produced by the â¢ntrodu'flion of ufeful
machines. Rams of thefr, eonftrufled atafmall
exprnce, *ill, when managed by a few fkilful
artifis, perform the week done in a particular
IBanulaitnry by two or thr e hundred workmen.
Now, how arethefe machines at d artifti to be
procured? The anifls acq ii e the r ikili and
riextcri'y by praclice and they invent their ma
c 1Â»"Â« to expe'i'e and ptrlei) their operations.
Theartifts, therefore, can he found only v,herc
the arts a r e praiVifed, and as they alone under -
(land the management of the machines-wUiefe,
even if they could ba procured alone, whijh is
for the moll part impossible, would be useless
when fc pa rated from the former. By import
ing the artills, you render it unnec. flary to im
port the tnach nes ; they can afterwards con
flruil them, or dittcfl other artists in their fab
ricationâHerce it appears that the high price
of labor, which prevents the -rtabliilimeHt of
inanufjiiories in America, can be remedied on
ly by encouraging the immigration of f reign
srtiil:. hether any improvement in lkill and
dextenty, would enable the aris to flourifh in
Amrrica in the prtfent llateof htr population ?
is a qittfl.oa not eafi'y to be determined. It is
poitihle that the <>X;>Â£nre njceflary to eftabi.iih
and fiipport them would flil! be toe great ; or,
in other words, that the flock of the individual
would ftili !>e emploved to greater profit in agri
culture than in any other art. There is, how
ever, one K<n, existing in this country, which
leaves on my mind but I Ule doubt, that with an
acccfli.JS of fwreign artifis, and the introduction
of valuable m chines, almost any ait might be
pradlifed in tie United States. We have some
Mr President, and not others,
Thus we have nianufaCloi its of cotton in Penn
sylvania, and the art of (tamping both linen and
coitoH ci th is pia<slifed ihere to a very great ex
tent, but even ri Pennsylvania we have no wool-
Jen manufactories. In Englandthefe manufac
tories flomilh in the fame county ; and confe
queiitlv, the profits to he derived from employ
ing a capital in them mitfl be either equal, or
Vc y neirly so. If the profits of the cotton
inaiiutiflory g'eatly exctede lthofe of the wool
len, Hock, whtek always fetks the most lucrative
emp! yment, would ft 'W fr m the latter to the
former, and the wooltefi iiunufa&ory would de
cline /is to the gross materials worked up in
those arts, tlie whole of the cotton and a great
part of the wool are imported into England, the
the former from Asia, the latter, from Spaiu ;
and the manufactured articles are fold in the A
mtrican market. But we can, with the advan
tage. of a ftiorter carriage, undtrfcll the English
in their cotion manufaijliirea, and, yet, under
the fame ciuUmfiances, they can undersell us in
their Aoollens. Why? Bscaufe we have near- (
ly tqgal fk'll with the English, in the one art
but i hey surpass us in the other. This is the.
ot.ly atriwerthat can be g ; ven. The rude ma- ,
teruls uled in those arts are equally convenient ;
to Us, as to the Erglifii, and if either manufac
ture ha? an acvantage over the other in this re
fpe.'il, it is the woollen. Cotton is the growth
nf the Southern States only 1 , but the whole eoun
trv fui'niihes paflurage for and the wool
of thefeju hith feed on the mountains of Virgin
ia is reputed to be feiperior to that of Spain im- i
ported into England for her finer mannfaiiures.
Since than the profits of ourcotton man.ufatflo
rv are fufiic jently great to sompenfate the high
price of labur ir. the praflice of that art, and
and those of ihe woo len wun'.d be as great had
our artifis greater flcill, it is a ncccfUry conclu
sion, that it is for want of fk'll and dexterity,
that the high price of labor impedes the praflife
of that art.
But to be convinced how highly fkilful artifis
enght to be estimated, and how indefatigable
every nation, rude in mannfacfluring art.should
be in i|Â«e*ertion6 to procure them, we need on
ly view the regula'ficns of different ftatei in re- ,
rard to to their emigration and the exportatioH ,
of their inftruiuents of labourâEngland has

nation of the editor to difchnge his duty
confc entioufly : he may be a victim
to the dark rage of 'he worll enemies < f
our government and liberties; but it shall
not be said nf him, that he abandoned an
important right, guaranteed by the consti
tution became men entrufled for a time
with he authority of the people, dared to
forget their duty to trample on that righ',

doubly criminal in him to shrink before the

nWn dazzled by tlie glare of power, at a time
when the liberal support he receives from va

only the stubborn Confifteucy of freedom and
the love of truth, but a marked approbation
of hts pall conduct as well as a determination
to aid him in the arduous and expensive un

REMARKS.
V.rious reflations are excited on reading the
foregoing extras. The encroaf. of fubferibers to
I'acht 's publications is a circumstance that merits
attention. , .
rheis are but few persons who encour gpubli
cations so boilile to the peace, liberty and inde
pendence of this country, who would not join its
enemies in fubvertmgits constitution and govern
mem, and facrifieing its independence. Bache fays
this encreafe is beyond his moll sanguine expecta
tion, and since he has been perfecutrd, â¢'has been
rapid beyond parallel." However faife or true this
may be, them is no clou; t that the m're feeent
and outrag.ous attacks on the govein'Tient and its
administration have been made in the spirit of cn
terprize and experiment, in order to try the Orength
ol the laws and to cXcite the lukewariti partiza s
of the faction to come forwtfl with their patron
age. If Bathe's aflerrions are true, he has fucteea
ed in bothol.je.Ss, fully in but partially in the
other ; although he fays p?rfecution has alfumed
"a form and prÂ»flure." I however such atro
cious calumnies are to pafiiwith such "aprijpirt,"
and the government remains uulbakcn, we mav
defy the univsrfe to produce a parallel for firmnefs
and liability.

ity the charafler of a lover, who fought a con
im ntSion with her on honorable terms } that
of he continued his attention to her till he had

e Ebenezer Doughty was next calledâ .
d He swore that the defendant told him about ,
e a twelve-month ago, at which time, as it ,
1 afterwards appeared, the plaintiff was pregr (
1 oant, that if a certain something turned up,
v
it? ilriuld be marred vrry fnortlr.â-other
v.-ife not in two, or three years i and that he

tentive pa .her. and f> her only.
< "/iilitwn Valjead f .y>sre tint he saw the
djfcjidant frequently visiting the plaiatiff.
' and attending particularly to l;Â£r ; that be
j him if lie intended to marry, and lit
j fit id he did hot know ; on which the witness
I adrifed him to discontinue bin viliis,to which
howevet he paid no regard, but went to fee
her as tifunl. At length it appeared he
plaintiff wa< pregnant, and cinrged it upon
the defendantâl\e did not pretend to deny
it, but said, however, on being asked if he
won d marry her, -h did not know how it
might b , but he could not think of such a
thing then, and begged the matter might
reft thââ  re til! he ,'hould come back from the
cou'i'rf, wh re he was going to preach the
goip 1- â¢
Margaret Marfan was then cal - d h< the
lall wttrtfsâShe said that (he was prcfent
when tf.e Uef dant was foul for and told of
the plaintiff's situation, aid charged with
his baf-nefs 'o her, and reproached by her
that lie had fedtiod her under a promise of
: marrip.gr. He ad itted he was the father
j r.f the child, and as to the rell he replied,
! that he heft and godiieft of men had b.-en
} overcame ; that Ada-n and David, and So
-1 rnon had alfp fallenâ-but that this was
all owing, however, to t!ie warmth of her
o.Â»n paflivmt ; and in fine, that if he had pro
mi fd her martiagt, she coul : rot prone t,
u.ir coulu (he recover any damages it she
did, for he was no-: w rth any thing.
Here the plaintiff's counsel relied the
catile, leaving it to the jury to prelu de
whether a promise of m iriiage was not fa
irrefillab'e as to entitle them to a verditl.
The counsel for the pieachri- opened the
defenfe by Hating, that they should depend
rnuchvon the failure of the plain'iff s proof - y
but if the jury theuld be of a different opin
ion, they fliould shew, in mitigation of da
mages, some ver) improper conduct on the
part of th plaintiff, such as no virtuous
woman cnu! I be guilty of j that they would ;
next (how that the defendant wan worth no- j
thins, and of fourfe it could not be cx- 1
petted that a Jsrsiiel for large damages
woind be given, even if they fliould 1 think
the plaintiff had made out her cafe.
Roderick M'Cloud.was then called again,
as a witness for the defendant. He was
a (Iced by Mr. J.ee if he was not knowing
to the plaintff having at some time granted
improper liberi es to a certain person ? He '
answered very readily, that he was knowing i
to her granting very improper freedoms in- j
deed, and such as he wa* perl'uaded no vir
tuous woman in such a situation would
Here he was interrupted by Mr Monroe,
who told him that such was very exception
able tiftimony, and that lie must name pre- !
cifely what these freedoms were, that the
jury m'ght judge of themâHe was then
a(ked who that person was who had received
such improper favors ? He boggled a little,
and at length said he could no 1 answer that
quelli >n, as it affetied too nearly his own
charadler, but it being mged upon him, he
confeffed- that he himfelf was the prrfon.
He was then asked if he was not also a Me
thodill preacher? This he declined answer
ing, and his counsel attempted to support the
objefhort, but ,t being ruled by the court to
be proper, he was compelL-d to answer in
tjie affirmative. âHe wasjihen a(ked tu tell
thfe jury eiadly what these freedoms were;
this seemed to trouble him ftyrely ; but after
a little hcfuatlon it came out, that (he liad
permitted him to wait upon her home, four
or five times, and /Â« iifther,znd he had
once laid his hand on her neck ;âbnt it ap
peared from further examination, that (he
had refilled him even when he attempted to
kiss her, and absolutely refufid him when
he attempted to take any further liberties.
He acknowledged this was after (he was in
a state ps pregnancy ; but denied that it was
produced t>y any preconcerted plan between
the defendant and himfelf; or that he had
donc.it with a view to inform the defendant
of it or afjiti him inlhis cause. After be
ing interrogated by Mr. Monroe about
twenty minutes, ar.d going through what
may be cai}ed a/m ating process, he was per
mitted to retire,
James G.pnrlay was called to prove the
defendant's e'rcumilances, which he swore
were qu:te penurious, but that his father
might be w <rth 3 or 4COI.
The evij nee being closed Mr. Evertfon,
for the defendant, arose and addrefled the
jury in behalf of his client-âHe said, he
felt himfelf mvommonly at a loss what to
fay in this cause, which he thought was
not supported by trftimony ; for tlic answer
>f the defendant to the plaintiff, Â«â¢ that (he
:ou!d not prove chat he ever promised her
rtarriag , w.isvery equivocal evidence that
He hadâthai the plaintiff having pr.jvcd
:hat (lie was a person of refpcdtable con
letfti ns, and rat 1 r above the
nilead of h<vi g th cff-.cl to l'ncreafe the
Jamaica, ought i t last to lessen them ; for
t fhewtn, !-ic~ ' ad, n<it loit an opportunity
jfmaking Â« very good match. But what
iveigheq ni-.it i.i his mind was, her own be
lav our, which he cyttld not but confidcr as
Â«ry,rcprehenlibleâ that it was a maxim in
aw, that a plaintiff Giould always come into
:ourt to aflc for juttiee " with pure hands,"
"â tit as to this person, it having been proved
jy ihtir own evidence, that she had had a
-hild by means of illicit commerce, they
:ould not think her a very virtuous woman,
but that htr behaviour to the witness, the
Rev. Mr. M Cloud was in his nihid a for
feiture of all characterâfor a wonian who
iva3 courted by one mar, to fuff.r another to
wait upon her home, to kiss her, and fondle
with her so much as uven to lay his hand
upon her neck, evinced, he would fny, " a
nolent propensity to concubinage and
no virtuous woman would .do it, efpeciall)
it tie age of fivs a:id twenty) when the
palfi. ns may be supposed it; some measure

mending to the Jury tr coufider the dpfen
dant'i circumftiafvs,
Mr. Harrifon then rose, arid in a speech
of about h ih m hoar, addrefled the jury in
that eloquent and impreffivc manner, which
iiveay. charatierises that gentleman when
fieak'ing tmdeiv the eonvi&ion that head

was his duty to drip the a {Turned cloak of

bjg-owed for the vile and di-telfab'e pur.

give expression to the indignation that he
Celt. He would not, he fw'd, detain the
jury by a minute examination of tfie tcfti
mony ; he submitted the force <>f it tq tVem
in full confidence that they would readily
discern where the truth lay. Ag to the
pitiful defence which h d been set up, that
(he had granted impropei liberties to ano
ther pei-foii, at a >ime when (he had receiv
ed promfe f marriage from the defendant)
he was u labl'e to fee as the gen'leman on the
otheT fide had done the great crime in it,âÂ»
it was to be remembered that the witnffs
| had b. en r ceived by her as th; friend of
I her and confnlering hid extraordinary
app ar.ance of fanclity, fhc could not ti.ink
there was mm h harm in granting him the
liberty of kiili g her che:kâpejliapfc afur
relirtanceâ.perhaps in a 'rolicklunne muod.
As to the pl-a of poveity in the defendant,
if that was permitted, all morality would
be at an end. it would on y be for a man
to fay he was poor, and could not pay d;i
---i mage-, and lie might commit any crime
| with impunity. Since it had arrived to
j that pass, that public tcach.'is of religion,
I inllead of felting a pattern of virtur, exhi

! infamy, it had become the duty ofc Courts
| and Juries to exert all th ir powers and all
I their infl;ur>uce-to prcferve th&mwalk of the
'
| faying, that if the JÂ«ry did not mark this
rase, by a verdict of exemplary damaget, he
was very appiehenlive of the pernicious cf.
forts it would have on focie'y.
His Honor Judge Kent, then slated to
the jury the Jaw, as :t applied to the fa&Â»
in the caf , and gare them a summary of the
' evidence; he observed that ;hey mud not

CJ- THE NEWS.
f Front the Salsm Paper of yefttrday.]
Yelterd.ty captain Besom arrived at Mir
blehead from Bayonne, in France. His
original destination was to Bilboa ; but he
was taken by a Fifnch privateer, within a
Ihort fail of bis port, and carried into Bay
Once, where he found l umbersof his coun
try men atid other neutrals, the viftimsof a
fyllem of plunder, which disregards every
principle of justice or morality. An indis
criminate co - demnatioii of captured proper
ty was carrying on ar Bayonne ; that taken
from Americans and c?>nde'"ned, amounted
to nearly a million and a half of dollars
Capt UefÂ°m lofl his cargo, but by some
compiomife retain-d his ve'fel, in which he
brought home forty of his countrymen, and
saved t-'nem f om the alternative of e'teritig
on board French privateers," or starving.
The pretexts frr were of the
molt trivial kind, and amounted to nothing
short of i> declaration of war against all neu
tral property.
They exptfted, at Bayonne that these
aits of rapine would finally rouse the Ame
ricans to war, and thit in confeqncr.ee their
Weft-India colonies must fall ; but these
events they difiegardtd as of no impcrtance, j
â¢so long as thcie was commerce for their pri- j
vateers to prey upon. New privateers, from ]
16 to 20 guns, were continually building !
and launching, and they were profeffedly
(Jeftined against the Americans, at whose
condnÂ£t they affeÂ£t to miich irritated.
But the merchants, and peopleof idforma
tjon, who were not imecUjtely interested in
privateering, discovered uneafinefs at the
v present state of things, wticn theytfir-d to
ex press their fen '.nents, and appeared to
fce both tired of their government, and\
afliamed of the injuries which were heaped
tipon the Americans.
The military themfelve', who are diftrib
â¢uted throughout the country to keep the
people in awe, begin to murmur ; not at the |
cause in which they were engaged, but that I
their pay was considerably reduced.
There was a good deal of talk, at Bay- :
onne, of an expeÂ£talion that Spain would !
â withdraw her connections with France.
This would be extending the field of pri- I
vateering, and encreafing the emoluments of |
the direftory, who receive 15 per cent of i
. the amount of all prizes.
Capt. Besom has favored us\vith French
papers to the 16th of June.
By th* Clef du Cabinet des Sovverairis of i
ths lothjune, it appears that the French go- |
vernment had received an Englilh papercon- .
taining the dispatches from the American
Envoys to the President of the United
States, which were communicated by the
President to Congress on the 3d of ApaiL
In confeqtience thereof the following letters
passed between Mr. Gerry and Mr. Talley
rand, âwhich letters are also published in
the said paper, after a long, iajfdiotis, and 111
many refpe&sfalfe, commentary on the dis
patches. It does not appear that the dis

in Paris.

Paris, May 30 1798.
1 communicate to you, Sir, a London
Gazette of the 15 of May (old style.) I
cannot learn without surprize that some
perfidious perfon< have availed thettifelves of
the retired manner in which the Envoys of
the United States chose to live, to make
them pvopofitiors and hold with them con
ventions, the objedl of which was evident
ly to deceive them.âl beg you to let me
know immediately the names of the persons
dtfign3ted by the letters W. X. Y. and Z.
and also the name of the lady whom Mr.
Pinckney declares to have conversed with
lum on American affairs. If you have an
objection to fending them in writing please
to communicate them confidentially to the

have been handed me. ITie last contains
all the informal negotiations communicated
by the Envoys to their government.
If unauthorized pertons have come for

exceeded them, they have abused the
French Government ami the Envoys;
I nra net competent -to judge of th's,
as they did rot produce any docu
ments whatever to prove that they were
authorised to treat with us. The publica

delicate my lituation is, with refpeft to the
tia-ries cf these persons, and they contain
eirctimftances which I hope will enable you
to investigate the affa'r without infilling
upon further commtl'iicatio' S from me. De
fitotis however to dispel suspicions by which
innocent persons may be Â«mbarraffed, 1 have
no objection to- declare that three of the in
dividuals alluded 10 are and that
the fourth zdVed only as a mellengjr a n d ii

Minister, the extreme reluftancc of the En

POSTSCRIPT.
Just as this paper was going to press, a
gentleman handed us a Greenock letter of
the 21 ft of June ât 'ays, " this morning's
accounts from Ireland ilill continue favour

It appears too, from the official details in
the Courier of the 19th June, that

of Ireland
The Irish infurgerits in the counties of
Down and Antrim have thrown down their
arms and given up their leadersâMonroe, a
famous one, was executed oa 'the 16th of

The following paragraph is from the Glas

"Talleyrand Perigord the French minis

41 M via ft was on the 14th, which 1 hope you
: have received. It was writtc â¢at a ferrous time.
; I however have now the pleasure of in fur mi
Â« you that every appearance of Rebellion in the
J North seems to beat an end* and the leaders
< disposed of. So confirmed am I in this belief,
1 that I am tVu day lending back my family and
! furniture to my feat in the country,'about a mile
from town, where I hope once more to enjoy
peare and comfort. In a (hort time, I have no
doubt things will come routid here. To day the
D-.'rham Cavalry went on to Dublin, as did se
veral other regiments, general Nugent having
no more o( cafio'n for their afTifiance Both the
counties of and Antrim are tranquil, and
I our markets again tolerably fiippl'ied."
I Tt is with high pleasure we ibform the
public that his mr,jetty's frigate Androme-
I da, captain Taylor, and sloop of war Lynx,
! captain Hall, have taken the following

plundering our tradeâthe former a French
corvette of 22 gutls sent into Halifaxâthe
latter, n privareer of i 6 guns and a schooner
of 12 guns, which are both fafe in Bermuda.

H. 'nfurances will also be made on buildings ami

pays a premium for the renewal, he is not insured
during such time ; Ror can the infcrance be renew

forty ttre< 0! land, under good improvement, and
aÂ» much hiori in the vicinity, as may be required
for future improvement.
The grift mill is a handsome, sewaiid well fin

Among the many advantages of thisfitustion,
mud be numbered the fertility of thefurrounding
countryâbeing the bÂ«ft improved part of the coun

coarfe by land and water, the Geneffce flateroad
pafling through it, as w<il as all wa'tr c.-.rriage to
