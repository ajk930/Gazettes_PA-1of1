In Saturdays gazette we announced the death of c
Mr. Kennedy, late Secretary of the Land-Office other i
of this (late. Of this gentleman the following no- ns
ticcsarea tiibute of jwflice to civic and private a P'
merit: Mr. Kennedy died after a few days illnafs, P ur ;
in the 55th year of his age; upwards of 20 ot " n
which hs had bÂ«en in public ferrice. In difcharg: uirer
ing the duties of his office, Mr. Kennedy was affa
ble, punctual and conscientious. In private life g'Â°
complacency of temper, benevolence of heart, and a '
â¢he circle of Christian virtues, formed the promi
nent features of his character ; and viewed as a huf- 13 Y
band, father, friend, or faithful servant of the pub- |' on
lie, his removal from life is a public and private lrt Â°

Â» SPIRIT OF 1776.' 0U
Our Jacobins pretend to feel the spirit of -p
What was that spirit ?It was all pure American, r
without any adulteration or intermixture with L " c
French taffia or democratic whisky. Congress in 0 v
the declaration of independence spoke the language "J" 1 '
of Americansâthe language of manly go#d lenfe . '
and real national dignity. They declare that as to tl â¢ ]
Britain they will, "be enemies in war, in pcaee P sltl
friends." ,
The war whoop Jacobins exclaim, we arc ene- u
miesto Britain. A friend of Britain is a foe to e *
our liberty and independence. Is this the spirit of ur
'j6 ? U U dire&ly contrary. It is the firft ar
ticle of Jacobin duty to be the enemies of Britain
in peace. Yet aflc them, whether they would go
to war with that nation, they fay and swear no, no, othl
no. It is tiuly said ofthofe who will /wear that t ere
they will *** te i
The spirit of *76 was pitriotic. No country ftrn
was then loved or refpe&ed so much as our ownâ
The Jacobins lately toasted the French constitution
and gave nine cheers. To our own they gave on-,
ly three. Citizen Jacobins, is this like' 76 ?
The spirit of' 76 was magnanimous and heroic. t hii
We appealed to heaven, and defied the hods of in \
Britain and her hireling Germans. No one then 01
desponded or shrunk from the crisis. What is the l 'f
languageof the-Jacobins at this day ? It was France
and France alone that won liberty and independence thj
for America. _ Ms
Our liberty cannot be maintained, if the French ths
are defeated. We mud become slaves uolefs the Ai
French hfcld their conquests of Flanders, Holland D;
and Savoy. Their cause is our cause. (
Is this the spirit of '76. No, it is the language * v {
of cowards and traitors. It is the language of fu- th
oitiyfÂ» from a land of slavery and who bring the t0
Spirit OT tiavcs wnii un.w,
maintain with the native Americans that are th.
now infinitely more able" in refpeft to power and re
sources and not any worse disposed than we were in tn
'76 to maintain our liberty and independence.
The fpitit of '76 was really independent. Con
gress with indignant firmnefs rejected every attempt
of Britain to treat \|ith us as Coloâ¢"- But our
Jacobins, with the spirit of Coloniils, orrather with
the dastardly spirit of slaves, reproach our Govern.
ment with having made a treaty without consulting
France, deny the right or propriety of any treaty Wl
with her foe, and rejoice to read the miserable in- et
fultsand threats that are copied from the Paris tv
news-papers, or fabricated in this country. P'
Tske a review of the conduct of our disturbers 'Y
and it will appear that there is no resemblance bet- te
ween their principles and those of '76 which they ra
affect to hold in veneration. There is a muchnear
erlikcnefs bctwven the Jacobins and the Tories of c< -
'76. The tories said at that day, America cannot > e
govern herfelfâ(he must be dependent on Britain P ;
to protest her. _ P (
The Jacobins parody this sentiment and exclaim g
forever, draw close and closer the bands of brother- V
lv union with France. Our liberties depend fulely
on this union. If France throws us off, we are loft
and undone. Our,political salvation is staked upon H
the alliance. Men of' 76, if you are not in your v
graves, are you not angry to hear Jacobins take 11
yotir names and disgrace them ? 11
Kxtrads from the AURORA. a
Certain violent enemies to 'the trade of kings
think that the French have made an indifferent f
bargain with his Sardinian majesty ; and that he _
Ihould have been at once turned out of a throne of 1
which his tyrannical government, and the proverb- a
ial perfidy of his ancestors have rendered the whole !
family so remarkably undeserving. The terms of <
the Treaty, if examined with attention, willjullify c
the French. They are to poflefs his fortrefles till 1
the end of the wai, and after that time, till a trea- <
ty of commerce is concluded between the parties. <
We may readily guess what kind of treaty is, under <
such circumllances, likÂ«ly to be made. The terri ]
tories which the French now hold are liable to con
tributions, till restored ; and the mal contents in '
the royal dominions are to be indemnified. Add to 1
this, that about two fifths of his continental terri
tories are taken from him, and the reft more than
- half fiiriounded by the French conquests. It must
then beevident that he has paid pretty smartly for
his snare in the confpiracj of crowned heads ; and'
that he is now but a pageant exilling by the in
dulgence cÂ£.'he Republic.
Buonaparte has begun to collect the paintings

This Lottery will afford an elegant specimen of the pri
vate buildings to be ereiled in the City of Wafhington--
Two beautiful designs are already felecfted for the entire
fronts on two of the public squares; from tnefe prawings
it is proposed to erect two centre and four corjter buildings,
as soon as pollible after this lottery is fold, and to convey
them, when complete, to the fortunate adventurers, in
the manner described in the scheme for the Hotel Lottery.
A nett deduction of five per cent, will be made to defray
the necelfary eipenfes of printing, &c. and the surplus
will be made a part of the fundintended for the National
Univerlity, to l>e cteded within the city of Washington.
The Drawing will commence as soon as the tickets are
fold off.âThe money prizes will be payable in thirty days
after it is finilhad ; and ary pr.zes lor which fortunate
numbers ate not produced within twelve months afttr the
drawing is closed, are to be considered as given towards
| the fund for the University ; it being determined to
the whole business in a year from the elding of the draw
ing, and to take up the bonds given as security.
The real securities given for the payment of the Prizes,
are held by the Prafideot and two Directors of the Bank
of Columbia, and are valued at more than half the a
mount of the lottery.
1 The twenty four gentlemen who by appointment oÂ£
the late Commiflioners aflifted in the management of the
Hotel Lottery are requested to undertake this arduous tafic
a second time on behalf of the public ; a fufficierit num
ber of these having kindly Accepted, it is hoped that the
friends to a National Univeifity and the other federal ob
jects may continue to favor the design.
By accounts received from the diflerent parts of the
Continent as well as from Europe, where the tickets
I have been sent for sale, the public are allured that the v
drawing will speedily commerce, and that the care and
caution unavoidably necelTary to insure a fafe disposal df
the tickets, has rendered the fnor- suspension indilpemable.
