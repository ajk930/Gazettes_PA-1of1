the neccllity of obtaining further information, or ad

the general agent thinks it his duty to add, (for the I

4 ijUer to I'tMnlhy P'tchcrmg, Â£fq. Secretary
of Slate, from the Chevalier de Yrujo,
Miiiifkr Plenipotentiary of his Cqthblic M.X-,
j'fly, &C..&C. dated July 11,1797.
SIR,
. YOUR additional report to the Prefidertt
of the United" States' of the proceedings of
the officers of the king of Spain, in relation
to nnd the running of the bounda
ry f'te, which I find pnbliihed in all the,
newfpipos, obliges me to trouble you, with
tnisletter. If yoiir discussion of facts had
been as correft. and impartial as there was
reafoa to expeft, I mould not have been un
der the necessity of undertaking this talk ;
but the conftruftion which you are pleased
to put upon every aft of the Spaniih oiFi
cers in general, and especially upon those in
which I am personally concerned, corapels
me to qbfei-vt upon several expression?, which
I have noticed in your said report.
You begin, fir, with faying* " that al
" tho' I had declared I had just reasons for
" fufpefting an expedition from Canada
" was preparing by the Britilh "against the
" upper parts of Louisiana, yet I never had
" mentioned a single faft or reason on which
" my fufpickm was founded."âln my let
ter of the 2d of March, I pointed out to
you the probable route which the expedi
tion woyld take, and in our conference of
the 27th of February, I gave your informa
tion that a corps of 350 men had been raised
at Montreal, and marched towards the
Lakes, where, after the evacuation* of the
American forts, there was no ostensible ob
jeft for them. v I also told you that I knew
( that the Britilh agents had treated with some
; of the Indian nations in that country, con
ceding thq intended expedition, and I ad
ded tltat I had received those aifices Jrom
: ptfi-foh â who might be depended ort, who
j had seen those new levies pafliag through
e Johnstown, 011 their way to the weft\7ard.
i But, even supposing that I had not entered
- into any particulars, even supposing that my
\ information at that period was not complete,
yet did not the interest and dignityof this
i government âdid nqtjts friendly conneftion
i with Spain, require that it fliould have taken
â¢ every proper means to prevent the attempt
' we were threatened with, hy giving fuitabk
f orders to general Wilkinfon, or to the com-
II manding officers of the niilkaryo-force Or
.- those frontiers? The abfofute silence ir
this particular of the documents which ac
lj company the report of the secretary of war
,f your never having communicated to me an)
â t determinate disposition on this point, as yov
ic do in your answer to my letter, which it
the publication is marked No. vn. afforc
mi fufficiefat grounds to fear that these pre
B cautions were omitted. You add, fir, wit!
(1 a-degre'e of candour difficult to be conceived
ie that from my not having given to yoiv detail
ed information refpefting the expedition, an<
from the answer which you received on th'
19ih ultimo-from the Stitifh mimfler, yxju be
- liev'ed my ful pic ions to be groundless. I
it poflible, that any ofie will candidly ima
gine. that if the Englilh intended to violat
Â£1 the ternary of the United States, in orde
to effect a coup de main, they would-be as in
e > genuoys in answering, pis you were in afkinj
their minister the question ?
I (hall not enter info all the observation
which suggest t-hemfelves to'my mind, Fron
|y your having, communicated to Mr. Liftoi
id the contents of my letters. I expeÂ£ted t)#l
the American government would have watch
5 " ed hi's, motions, and taken the mean&whicl
I have already mentioned to prevent the fuc
to cess of a similar enterprize ; but I neve
r . could have imagined that you would hav
given to the British mjnifter a piece of ad
th vice, which might enable him to alÂ£er hi
plan, by letting hiol know that the
one was discovered. By) the line of condui
r _ which you, hive pursued in thiÂ« l btifincTs,
am coriviiKed, that had I communicated t
to y<Ju more particular details refpefting thi
r- tranfaftlon, you wvnld, with the fame goo<3
natured franknefs, have given infprmatio
11 â¢ of-them to Mr. !Â»' Han.
j'" But, if you did twlieve that asking th
queflion of .the Britilh envoy was the mo
efficacious means to prevent the violation c
the neutrality of the United-States, and tl
invasion of the Spanish territory, let meal
why you was so remiss in thib tneafWe, th;
, although I had C.qxnmunicatedvthis proje l
to yoii, verbally on the 27 th
and on the 2d of March, in writing, yet, i
he a matter obviously so urgent, you oril
r>r wrote-to the British envoy ,on the 28th <
April,'tliat is, tivo months afterwards?
on I shall not tliia fubjeft, withoi
ts -taking the liberty of making to you 01
[â' eb'fervation which is intimately conneft<
to with it. By the date of the letter I ha
just mentioned, it evidently appears that
to gave you advice of this intended expeditii
on the second of March, and that three days I
al " fore, I had given you the fame informal
0 Â£ verbally. I imagined from your known a
tention to br'inefs, and the importance
tft the' fubjeft, that you would have fubmitti
it immediately to the consideration of tl
President of the United States. On't
9th of March, I had the honor of Tpeakii
I :tÂ«j. Ur- Adams, at his lodgings at Francis
Hotel, and mentioned this fubjeft as a m;
ter that.J supposed him already fully infori
ine ed of; and, it was with no small surprize
heard him fay, that he ineto nothing about .
<d- X produced the map, which I had in n
pocket-book, and he listened with great z
tention to all that I had to fay to him.
0 f v/as no do ( ubt to this conference with W
Adams, that I was indebted toyouranfw
. 'ofthe 1 ith of the fame month. I shall e
tirely abflain from putting any conflrufti.
upon the reasons which induced you to on
,ut making this communication to tht Prefidei
nd but they must have-been very powerful m
t:\cswhich could oblige you to'remain
1 Icujg dent on a matter of such >rnpor.tr,t!(,
;x â  '
You fay, in the thud paragraph of your
report:, orf*' y'ftur'--afki-ng-itfe whii meifures
Spain had. taken !rv o'rder to carry intcrexc-,-
â cotion that wart of the treaty 'which'relates
to the withdrawing i\ie gkrrijbni, I anfwercd
you on the 191 th of-April* that I hud been
for foius months - without receiving lettars
from the baron, and c inTequently " was en
tirely ignorant of the il&ps which had "been
taken for- the execu-tion of the treaty."â
From this exprefiion, which, in order to
j draw attention, you place between inverted
commas, you infmuatt; an inference which
in my opinion is very far from being true,
when you add immediately afterwards :
" Nevet thelefi. he hadprev'tatifly informed the
baranhf Lis fafpictont of a pro letlrrf expertliicn."
What is ihii to.prove, fir ? That the baron
indeed had received my letters, but not that
I had received his. The irregularity and
uncertainty of" navigation easily "fliews l;hat
your logic on this point is extremely falfe.
In the fifth paragraph, after giving an
Recount of my .letter of the Z4UI ultimo,
and of its objeft, you t/hferve that I have
omitted to mention-; among the other com
plaints of the Baron, that of Mr. Ellfcott's
npt having given him notice of his arrival at
Natchez. Permit me, fir, to represent to
you, that you have entirely mistaken what I
had the honor of telling you on that occa
sion, for I simply mentioned, not as a com
plaint, but as a mere observation, that the
Baron j in the rigour, might not nave consid
ered Mr. Ellicott as an American Coromiffi
oner, for not having given him on hiÂ» arrival
official notice of his â appointment, haying
merely informed him of it in the way of a
confidential communication. You cannot be
ignorant, fir, that there are certain requisite
formalities when nations treat with one ano
ther of their mutual concerns, which are not
required between individuals? The Baron,
when he speaks in this manner, clearly points
out his meaning, that, besides the confiden
tial letter, the communication of which you
tonfider as so important, no doubt he expedl
en another official one, including his Com
mission, Authority, orfome other document,
to ascertain the identity of the person, and
the objeft of his mi (Hon. When, on my
arrival in this country, I had not yet presen
ted my credentials to the Prefident,although
I had delivered to you a copy of tliem, you
1 might, in the rigour, not have recognized
1 me as the Envoy Extnjprdinary of the King
1 -my master, for want of having complied
â¢ with that neceflary requisite of the eftab
â  lifted etiquette. Ido not mean to fay that
â¢ 'Si the present qafe it was absolutely neceffa
Â» ry to go through a similar formality ; nor
1 did the Baron mention this but as a mere
- matter of olfn'vation,. which was not to af
t fed the objeft in although you,
thinking that it affords victorious ar
il gumen't, are pleased to give to this circum
-1 Itancc an importance which it does not de
i serve. Besides, sir f I might observe to you
- ..that wh<;h, after a mixed and desultory con
-1 yerfation upon various fubjeftsj I had col
, leftcd and methodized my ideas, and com
- them to writing, your answer ar.c
d ohferyatious ought to have been confim dt<
e the written communication, clothed with nl
- the necefTary formalities ; but neither do ]
swish to (lake of this an objedl of difcuflion
The proof -which you give in tjve fixtl
e paragraph of .your report, to (hew that it i
r not certain that Mr. Ellicotl intended U
1- get poffeffioh of Natchez by surprise, ,tn<
g that for that purpose he had endeavoured t<
gain over the inhabitants, is merely, nqga
3 tive. From your examination of the tÂ«;<
n persons you mentioi\, you little ti
n expeft ; The circupiftance alone of. the'i
t being tht. bearers of Mi". difpat
1-. ches, points out that they wefe both in hi
h confidence ; and it may be presumed with
out temerity, that being hii friends, or em
"r ployed under his orders, they would hard}-
e make a denunciation that might be prejudi
I- cial to him. Governor Gayofo dedate
is that he has proofs of the fads in his powei
!r J (hall not fail to apply to him for their

I rr.ore pofitively-on'thrs business.
o After having di feu (fed the history of th'ei
is tianfaftions with ali tire force and accurac
1- which result from these observations, yo
in allure with a very ill-grounded confident
that upon a view of the whole it appeal
is that his Majesty's. Governors on the Mill
ft ffippi, have, on various pretences, postpone
as the running of the boundary line, and tli
evacuation of the.polls. But I appeal t
(k that vandour which which you have so g<
at uerouliy Ihewn to the British Minister, th;
ft you may tell me, whether it can be called
jr, pretence, that the Baron de Carondelet, wh
in was entru.erd with the fafety of Louifian:

of that tvas not Jlipulatedfor by the treaty ? E
the lecond article it is only agreed that tl

ic the honor of presenting to you in myletti
of the 24th ultinVo, it is not to be presume
v? that it could ever have been the intention i
t his Catholic Majesty to deliver up fortiiic

be- considerable sums of money, may-be the e

his Majelly's forts and poflefTions to be ta>,
kt-n, and ail. this for. fearof creating ill-found
ed 'ftifpicions in your minds !
If you have not .been very fuccefsful Sir,
in the foliditv of your reasonings, you ap
pear not to be more so in the method offol
â¢ '-lowing tli, m. After having denounced us
to th& whole Ameiican nation as stirring np
the Indians against the United States, and
iH-eparjng them for a rttpture, vo\x fall into the
most glaring inconsistency in the following
paragraph i
Whrtl >er this flan of exciting the Indians to I
direst hoJMites againff the United States, has
lien contemplated audpromoted by any cf rnr
otvn ciiizen t, ti may be difficult to fay ; . but
that one or more of thof eitivns have proposed
and take n meaftires to detach the Southern Indi
ans from tie interefls of the United States, and
to dejlrby the influence of the public agents, over
those nations, and thus to defeat the great ob
jefts of their appointment, the chief of which is
toprefefvi peate, it certain.
t again appeal here, Sir, to your gene
rous candor. How is it possible to reconcile
such evident contradictions ? On the one
hand the Spanish officers are those vvho ex- 1 "
cite the Southern Indians against the United
States, and"on the other you quickly fol
low presuming, with fufficient foundation
in my opinion, that jt may be some citizens
of the United States. But although you
might entertain any doubts yourfelf ojj the
fubje&, which I am sure no person in Ame
rica will after reading Mr. Blount's letter,
did not this very fame doubtful cafe and un
certainty, require in your situation more cir
eumfpect language ? And if even in this cafe
you appear to have gone beyond what found
policy, the tranquility and iptereft of the
United Stases required how much more tui
jtrft are your infinuationsagainft Spain,when
the public possess, in Mr. Blount's letter,
a document bywhich they can fee, that if
the manoeuvres Vith the Indians were .not
favourable to the United States, they were
precisely combined to attack the Spaniards ?
From this method of reasoning 0/ yours, it
appear-, as if the Spaniards were jointly with
Mr. Blount, stirring up the Indians to at
' tack thtmfelveS.
Refpefting the laftarticle of your report,
I have only to obfervr, that although you
have constantly allured me that government
had not the lead information refpefting the
fubjeft ofmy representations, and although
letter of Mr. Jackson, of Georgia, ap
pears to coincide with your ideas, neverthe
less time has shewn that I have
with my duty by not reposing on sue& assu
rances. The plot is discovered, apJ nobody
any. longer doubts that the ejyxsdition was
to have taken plate.
After having followci you step by
step through tlie vad'ous points of your
report to tfte Prefidrtf, I shall make a short
compendium of fiich as arise from this let
ter) from which it-results.
1. That on the 27 th of February, I gave
you fufficient particulars refpedting the in
tended expedition, to have attracted the at
tention. of tbj6 government.
2. That although to tbiÂ» verbal commu
nication, I added another in writing on the
2d of March, the President had not the
least knowledge of it ori the 9th of the fame
month, and that without doubt yon must
have had very powerful motives to prevent
you fitom communicating it tcf him
3. That it does not appear by the docu
ments presented by the Secretary of War,
that Government had given orders to the
military commanders to cause the, territory
and neutrality of the United States 'to be
refpeCted.
4. That you made to the English Mini
ster a communication, which in my opinion
you ought not, and that even if you thought
it neceflkry, yoil delayed doing it for twÂ°
months, that is, from the 27th of Febryiry. 1
to the 28th of April,although it refpiaed 1
a most urgent and important objeCt.. <
5. That the Baron de Corondejet could i
very well have received my letters, without <
its necessarily following that WÂ» had come
to hand.
6. That the Baron did not represent Mr.
Eilicott's not writing to Wm officially as a
complaint, but as an olfer*<Qtiox[) and that in
faft he never has done it in those terms.
7. That the proof l , you alledge to excul
pate Mr. Ellicott, 'refpefting his intentions
of taking the For; of Natchez by surprize, (
are purely
8. That & not merely pretences, but ve
ry reafotis, which have impeded f
the Â°f the Posts, and the rnn- s
hing offihe Boundary Line. ( r
9. yhat the infiniiations with which you a
iK wiHing to persuade the American Peo-
pie ,that our arming is direAed against them, .
are unjust as well as unfounded, as by Mr. Â£
Blount's letter it is clearly demonstrated to 0
be a precaution for the mere purpose of de- y
fence. v
10. That ybu evidently contradict your- t
felf, when on one hand you are pleased to
attribute to us the movements of the Indi- f
ans, and in the Very next paragraph you
shew it might proceed from American citi
zens, as it aftually does according to Mr.
Blount's letter; and that he aCted with the
knowledge and intelligence of the very fame t ,
British Minister, in whose private notes, q
â¢without signature, and perhaps not of his hand
writing, yoil place such implicit confidence.
u. That although in all your official
communications, you have always manifefted
to me-that the American government knew
of nothing which indicated any foundation
for my fufpicioas, Mr. Blount's letter clear-
ly proves that I was perfectly iu the right.
I have thus fulfilled a very disagreeable
duty. Always desirous to contribute to
ftrenghen the bands of friendfhip which unite ai
Spain and America, and to which their tc
situation, their wants and resources, inyite "J
them, I have seen with' the rr.oif profound
grief, that the language and tenor of your
/ communication to the President, is not, in tl
ftrv opinion, calculated to prpmote so defi- vc

w The last accounts fratm the Mediterrane
e an, are greatly afflictive to the American
i merchants and public. The depredations
f on our commerce there, have a [turned'd new
degree of turpitude and audacity. < The
1 laws of nations, the rights of treaties, and
, every principle of juilice, good faith, and
f humanity, are violated and prostrated
t without remorse, and without shame. By
; 'the arrivals since our last, and by recent let
? ten, we have accounts of the capture and
t condemnation of many American vessels by
1 the French and Spanish, eyefc when bound
- to and from Spanish ports, and4Â»den whol
ly, with Spanish and American produce, and
, bona fide owned" by citizens of tKÂ« United
1 v ..
t The pretences for these condemnations
t are filfe most frivolous,arbitrary, and unjust;
1 tie wayt of papers, unknown to the Ame
. I'ican laws, and customs, is made the pre.
tenctf in some instancesâthe pofTeflion of
I the fame pajpers is made the cause of con
â¢ demnation in others. If the right of pro
â¢ perty is precarious, the veflel and cargo is
; sequesteredâis proved American property,
it is condemned as such. .No claim is al
â  lowedâno argument admittedâthe French
â¢ consular juriidiCtion is supreme, in Spain ;
and its decrees, fike the ancient, but left ar
bitrary laws of the Medes and Persians, are
irrevocable. The Captains of American
â¢ vessels at Alicant, have been told by UÂ»e
French Consul there, that although the vei-':
fel and cargo should be known to be Ame
rican ; ana although he should be fatisfied
that they were bound direCt from Spain to
the United States, if captured and
brought in, he should instantly condemn
themÂ»-and his threat has in rtiany instances
been fulfifled." Such being the.fituatton of
the Captains charged with American vefTels
in Spainj they were ncceflitated to applyÂ»to
the British Admiral at Gibraltar, and re
quefl'from him a convoy to protedl them
from the piracies of a nation with whom the
United States are at peace ; who instantly
Complied with their request ; and at the rifle
of losing one of the frigates of hi 6 squad

NEW CAUSES OF JVAR t! I
FROM THE . AURORA.
From the following extradl of a letter from
Paris, to the Editor, a hint may be ta-
Icen by our .administration, on informa
tion more to be depended on, prdbably,
than that usually- communicated to them
by their agents in Europe. If they
chufe to improve the hint, they are wel
come to it. At any rate it may serve to
warn the citizens in America as to what
they are to txpeft in consequence of the
perfidious coiiduft of their public servants
towards France; and also the (hare which
papers in the interests of the ad
ministration here, have had in fomen
ting the discontents of France to this .
country.
The letter not of a very recent date, but
â¢ it is from a good quarter.
" I read the other day a piece in the Ga
zette of the.United States, which proves,
tjiat your government dill encourages abuse
against this county, Among other
of stupid malignity, of which the article
was made up, it was said, that our national
institute, was not equal to the academy of
Princeton ; and that we were a people of
rascals and atheists. I know not whether
your government believes it a means of rcflor
iqg harmony to authorise as much as in them
lies, inveSives, fufh as our enemies alone dare
utter, by encouraging the papers containing
them} and thus actually paying for insulting
the republic. I cannot conceive what the
federal government would be at; but of this
I am convinced that they are facrificing, as
they have been doing all along, since the be
gining of this war, your plainest interests.
They (till exhibit the fame ignorance of*our
-.â¢ Â« . â¢ Â« â 
resources, the fame wafit Of forefight, as to
* the inevitable result Of the present holtilitiss;
They are blincUo the" power of France, and
J will not fee how greatly that power has |n
. treafed by her alliances. We do not want
, War vf'ith you, but your abandonment of the
1 principles of the n:\dern l&iv of nations by a
' formal treaty,has indifpofedus much ;it has exci
{ ted a mixture of contempt and indignation.
, "Commoo report informs us that Mr.
[ Hamilton it soon to ufhcT into light a pro
! ~duftion,-of which he has been laying the
! foundation since 1783 ,and of which Pacificus
and Camillns have been but trifling speci
mens. [We imagine the allulion is to
Pickering's letter to Pinckney.J He is to
prove in it tliat the alliance between France
I and America, has been a dark ccrnfpiracy'
from the begining; (George the third, was
of this opinion also, and on this account
Lawrence was confined in the- tower, which.
; he would have left for the fcaffold, if Olter
ior events had not favoured him) that none
' but rascals can be the partisans of that alii
' ance; that the condudl held towards France
| was flich as they should have expected; and
that this republic of scoundrels ftouldj be
sent a packing, and a close linion should
take place with England; that the execu
tive diredory are a set of fools, and will be
too lucky if they are fufferred to gain the
good graces of the new allies by condef
eentiofl.
" I wilh Mr. Hamilton much fatisfaflion
and tÂ® his readers the greatest pleasure ; in
the meail time we (hall set about soundly
beating our enemies in Europe,""as 3 ' pre
lude to an honorable'and advantageous peace,
and then we (hall turn gur attention to the
conduft of your government. We (hall fee
whether they Will persist in tTieir departure
from the principles,of the modern law of nations
âif they do, the lucrative commerce they have
â¢with our islands, Iforefie will be cutoff."
The only thing worth notice in the- fore
going article, is the modify and decency at
the introduction. It is a (ample of that hi
folence which vve (hould fatally experience,
were the hopes of the nefarious atheistical
1 faction to be realized, who, are now busHy
i employed in fabricating lies and danders
against our government. It is a direct at
tack 011 the freedom of thÂ£ press ; for-.it
ought never to be forgotten, that the freeft
and most pointed remarks on the Frerfch re
volution, which have appeared fn the ga
zettes of this country, were copied from
French papers, publifhed in Paris.
Bache fays " the letter is not of a very re
cent date, but it is from a good- quarter,"
and is from " information more to be de
pended on, [by our administration] proba
bly, than that usually communicated to tliem
by thieir agents in Europe." Our agents in
Europe are known, our governraent.pub*
lifhes their information wrth their names,
but who pr what are the correspondents of
this editor ? Coudefcend, great fir, to in
form us, that the people may judge fairly.
Those of our readers who have condemned
themselves to the reading of the Aurora,
will recolleft the several articles in this pre
tended ertraft, more at in the para
graphs of that paper, publi(hed only last
winter, â¢ particularly that refpe&ing Mr.
Pickering's letter to Mr. Pinckney. It
was repe a ndly-offer* , jmtK a frojit of bra
fen falfehood, that Mr. Hamilton was the
author of that letter.

ADMIRAL JERFIS'S FLEET.
Extract of an official dispatch of t)on Joseph
dc Cordova, Admiral and Commander in
Chief of the Spanijh fleet, to Don Juan de
Spanijh Minijler of Marine,
relative to the affion let-ween the Britijh and
Spani/h fleets, off Cape St. Vinceins, on
the I 4th February lafl.
(From the Madrid Gazette )
CADIZ, March 2.
" As soon as the English fleet was discover
ed, I ordered the" squadron under my com
mand to form itfelf into a line of battle ; but
the (hips El Principe, Le Regla and L'Ori
ente remained so much to the leeward ae to
be unable to form the line, without running
the rifle of being cut off by the eqemy, who
made up to waids us in good order, and erow
ding fail, as much as possible. I stationed
them oh the rear of the line, exceptihe L'
Orietite.with remained to the leeward flf the
enemy. â¢
" The firing began at three quarters after
ten o'clock, A. Mrbetween the firft Ihip of
our rear which preceded La Santissima Trina
ad' so that tke centre and the van took no
part in the action
" At this period I made figrial to the van
to tack about, to make up to the enemy ;
but mod of the {hips being not able to hear
my orders, I considered the loss of .Â£/Prin
cipe, Le Regla, and the reft of the tear -guard,
certain.
" In another movement, which I ordered
to double, and bring into afttion the combat
with the centre and the advanced guard, the
Santissima Trinidad came astern, and within
musket-shot of the enemy's line, ar,d sustained
the whole of their fire.
" When the headmost Ihip of the Englilh
had patTed through our rear, they tacked a
bout : five or fix .other (hips did the fame,
doubled us,, and prefrnted themselves on the
other tack, keeping up a most vigorous fire.
Having forefeen this manoeuvre from the be
ginning of ihe adtion, I ga*e orderj to the
headmost (hips to wear to the leeward of the
enemy's rear-guard ; Sc had this been practica
ble, the enemy would have been between two
fires. .
" The Engliih, after their last rtsanoeuvre.
directed all their efforts against La Santissima
Trinidad, that icmained to the leaward ; bur
11- Salvador del Mundo, II San Jofeff, El So
vera do, and El San Nicholas, having, by my
orders, fallen back to rhe rear, the signal was
given at two o'clock,?P. M. to bear up, crowd
fail,-and attack in all Points. La Santissima
Trinidad, 11 San Joseph. II Mexicans, II Sans
Nicolas, and II San Isidoro, alone held out
1 the combat,- with the whole Fleet of the ene-
