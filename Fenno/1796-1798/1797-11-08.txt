Late Foreign Intelligence.
LONDON, September 13.
The persons arrested on Monday morn
ing the 4th of September are the two Di
rectors, Carnot and Bartbelemy ; between
60 and 70 of the members of the two Coun
cils ; and the authors and printers of two
and thirty periodical publications,which had
exposed the conduct of the Direftory as un
eonftitutional.
The accusation preferredagainft thofeper
fons is a conspiracy to restore royalty ; and
the documents on which the charge is found
ed are a variety of papers said to be found
in the Portefeuille of M. d'Entraignes.
On the authenticity of tbefe papeis it is not
for Us to attempt to comment.
The mÂ«ft arbitrary and unconfiitutiona!
measures have been the immediate result of
this violent explosion. The Councils, at
the instigation of the Direftory, WITH- 1
OUT ANY TRIAL, have pronounced a
sentence of banishment on the accuied de
puties. And the Triumvirate make a merit
of not putting them, to death, as if it would
not be neceflary to produce some proof a
gainst them on their trials ; and consequent

The fame councils have annulled all the
laws which repealed several of the atrocious
decrees parted during the reign of Robes
pierre, and evidently sepugnant to the prin
ciples upon whichtheconftitution is profeffed
to be founded. They have removed even the
feeble barriers which that eonftitution had
interposed to the erection of arbitrary pow
er on the part of the Direftory. They have
authorifijd them to ciMivhpt trapps tlxyplcafe
to Paris, and to take inch means qs to them

country. In (liort, they have bnfely sur
rendered their own rights and those of their

A private letter from Paris, dated the
7th inft. we yesterday received from a very
intelligent correspondent. After a ctxrfory
view of affairs, which merely confirms the
statements already made in the various pa
pers, the writer assures us, " that the Di
reftory had some hours before dispatched a
special meflenger to Lisle, ordering the
commifiioner or plenipotentiary 0:1 the part
of France to demand from Lord Malmcf
bury a categorical answer to the lust propo
sition. Should his lordfliip hrfitate to com
ply with the request, or (hould his answer
be hostile to the views of the Direftory, ?n
intimation was to be given him, that hia
speedy departure from France would be satisÂ»
faftory."
This letter also mentions, that " Xloriait
had been invited to Paris by the Direftory ;
and that on the f>th inft. he was arrested at
St. Denni'3 on his route to the capital.
Moreau, one of the greatcft of mo
dern times, and the bo fori} friend of Pichc.
gin, was, when at the head of his army,
viewed by the Direftory with much jealoui'y
and fear. They knew that his political fÂ«n
timents corresponded mth those of Piche
gru ; and they dreaded his great popularity
among the fwldiersâthofe soldiers who had
refufed to address the Direftory against tlie
Councils.
" To excite murmurs and difcorrtenti ns,
to reijder the Councils unpopular, and thePtiation of Moi-ftft-i exceedingly difagr*e
a!i!e, the Dife&ory refufed for months to
, pay the arrears of the troops. To excul
pate them on the occnfion, message after
message wa6 sent to the Councils, defcrihing
the very alarming'ftate of the finances
These avid other aieafures of a similar na
ture produced the desired jffedt : and the
I riumviratfe, by an audacious violation of
the conftitutiort, arrested all those who were
supposed hoilile to their intereffi. Moreau
and,many others have thus fallen vi&ims to
their vengeance ; and France is now under
a military despotism."

NEW-YORK, Nov. 7.
The marquis de Bouills .((aid to be
arretted in France with Dumourier) is
in England. It is his ion the count who
is, on the continent.
In the ljte proscription of the deputies
bv the legislative body of France, their
fate appears to have depended generally.
|on the opinion of a Angle member. As
' the names were read over in rotation in
the councils, it was supported or pro
scribed, on the declaration of any indi
vidual. It must be imperious necessity,
indeed, that can warrant so flagrant a
| violation of every principle of justice.
Barbe Marbois. We mistook yes
terday in naming him among the new
party. In the proceedings of the coun
cil of elders, of which he was a member,
we noticed the name of Marbgt, which
for the moment we mistook for him.
He is, we regret to find, among the
profcribcd.
Pastoret, who not long since pre
sented a lengthy report on the 'relations'
between France and the United States/,
favorable to us, is also among the pro
scribed. In short, the change- that has
taken place does not add to pur former
hopes of a speedy accommpdation of dif
ferences. While France continues fub
jeftto those repeated revolutions, in men
and things, stability, or even rcftitu le
of conduft, is sot, from past events, to
be loolced for by any f.cutral nation.
We this day continui tbe regular de
tail of the late revolution in Franceâ
We closed yesterday with the proclama
tion of the directory on the '4th of Sep
tember ; and the articles foHowing now
are in regular fucceflion ; and which
will be continued till the whole shall be
completed. . *
As we mentioned before, Vhe deve
lopement of the cofifpiracy is grounded
on a disclosure of a variety of papers, the
detail of wjiich is extremely lengthy. To
have a clear view of them, however, it
is absolutely neceflary to preserve a ftriÂ£t
connexion of them as detailed from
French papers.
In addition to this connected f>lan,<
howeverâwe shall give separate articles
of a later date. Our Paris dates of 12,
13, and September, are three days
later than any others which have been
published.
The address of the Legislative Body
to the armies and 'departments gives
nearly similar information to whst was
contained in the address to the citizens
of Paris published yesterday, in that
to the French people, which we give this
day.

in the above different addrefles. These
papers were seized at Venice. The fol

" The king has learned, with the great

to reconcile to him the members of the two

A report has been spread for a few days part,
that the deputies, to the number of 171, had
published a protest against the events of the 4th

intelligence of this importance, because we
thought that the nature of our fun<Â£lions impos
ed on us the duty of not giving credit to a
measure whichcommitted the puhlictranquility.
Le Journal desLoixand des Faits,of the nth

that this protTlf, signed by 172 names, is in ex
istence. In spite, however, of thia declaration,
we have Strong reasons for doubting themithen
ticity of this intelligence, and our opinion is
founded on these circumstances :
The 4th of September a great number of de
puties met. those of the Council of Elders at La
fond Ladebat, and those of the council oS Five
Hundred at Andre de la Lqfere. As Lafond
and Andre both of them relide in the street of

We yesterday translated literally the arti

prance and England, contained in the Pa
ris Gazettes, which we received by express.
The late hour, however, at which these pa
pers came to our hands, prevented us then
from making any observations on the pro
bability of the intelligence that they an
nounced : but we are forrv to be now un
der the necessity of stating that if is totally
void of foundation. We have, indeed, every
reason to believe, that these accounts have
been fabricated at Paris for the lame pur
pose that the L'Eclair was last year forged
in London, namely, that of having an ef
fc& ou the funds. The scheme, however,
of the unprincipled stock jobbers who were
the authors of this falsehood, appears to
completely failed ; the iropref
fion did not take place; for the flocks,
which opened at 53 for time, rose only to
53 1-2, and soon fell back to 53.
