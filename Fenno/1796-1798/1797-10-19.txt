The Right Hon. Edmund Burke. Irtlvc
It- is but seldom that the world is sailed a m
upon to deplore the loss of such a man as t ac h
Mr. Burke ; for it rarely happens that fnch ; n f t
in Â»ffemblance of virtues and talents as dif- ton i
tinguiihed him can be found in one indivi- i ea d
dual. 1
At any other moment than the ptafent, kjp<
we (hould feel otirfelves better h o.
vgive the charader of this truly great man ; a y e
for having so very lately loft him* we fear ; n h
tliat our sensibility may on the one hand ;
carry us so far as to make us set no bounds gfoc
to our praise of him, whilst on the other, his
our refpett for the dead may prevent us 1 JtJnj
from lexhibiting the shades as-well as the I dov
lights that belonged to /him as a human be- I mac
ing, in, whose natufe no such thing as per- p ar ,
fefticm is to be looked for or expeAed. I flj 0 ,
Posterity will form a better judgment of [ hav
him from hi* work* than his cotemporarits {hJp
can, who,4 being under the influence of jna,
party, fee him only with the eyes of pre- p a s,
judice or partiality : thnsi whilst by one r
set of men he will for some time be celebrat- f a y
ed as a model of the purest patriotism, he niu
will by another be condemnedâhtiwevtr t OQ
unjustlyâas the Advosate of Despotism ma i
and Slavery, of Political and Ah- dut
tiquated Opinion*. on
It would be very difficult for any man tin:
in this*country, who has taken any part in an c
politics for the last seven years, not to have p al
ranged himfelf on the fide either of the
admirers or cenfurers of Mr. Burke ; and p ei
we do not pretend to fay that we have not na)
made up our minds with refpeft to his opi- his
nions. It i* on this ground that we feel wh
the difficulty of being called upon to give a hil
Aetch of his character. We may be bias- no
fed even when we think ourselves most free tet
from bias : we mean, however, to take irrt= H
partiality for our guide in what we are go- nei
ing to fay of this gentleman ; and we most p 0
deceive ourfelve*, if there be in our ye
minds the smallest trace of a lurking prin- f o i
ciple of unfairnefs, to prevent u* from using
the language of ftri& justice. lui
Ireland had the honour not only of giv- ci]
ing birth to Mr. Burke, hat of .having be- bli
gun and completed hi* educatiori. It has fti
aften been said of him by the way of re- b)
proach, that he was educated at St. Omers. ci
Any seminary of learning might have been ft]
proud of having sent such a scholar into nc
the world * and fufh a scholar would have d<
been too grateful not to boast of the febool di
of SL Omers, had he really been brought tk
up in ft. But the truth is, he never passed n<
a single day in that city, unless a* a travel- bi
ler, wbp, on hi* way to Paris, wished to g
fee whatever was worthy of a man of learn- oi
ing, genius and taste. The report of his a i
having performed there his early studies, x
originated in party misrepresentation, that It
would take from the weight of his, oppofi- o
' tion to the ministry of tlje day, by making o
[ the multitude believe that in his youth he o
had been a pupil of the Jesuits, and by re- d
' ligious profeffion a Papist. The insinuation ei
was in reality, though not intended as such, a
5 a compliment to the fathers of that society, tl
4 who, had there been truth in the afTertion, f (
i would have had as much cause "to be proud e
- of him, as we would have had little to be e
* a<hamed of them. t
'* The faft, however, was, that Mr. P irke e
, never was either a Papist or a pupil of the f
- Jesuits. His father was an attorney in t
- Ireland, and as such, at a time when Cat
'' tholics were excluded from the profeffion of
' the law, he must have been a Protestant. f
,/ Whether he had been so from his infancy, 0
is or whether he became so by conformity, a
r - we cannot pretend to fay ; but we believe, t
'' that be that as it may,'he was the firft Pro- t
ij teftant of his family. 1
f His children were brought up in the re- 1
>â  ligion of the state ; and his son Edmund
11 learnt ths firft rudiments of grammar at a 1
school in the county of Kildare, kept by 1
" a Quaker of the name of Shackleton, or i
bâ Shackleford, whom Mr. Burke had occa- i
u, fion, some year 3 after his arrival in London, i
to introduce to the Marquis of Rocking
hacn, and some other friends, as the inftruc- <
tje tor of his youth. ]
,g Under this master, he remained till he
n had studied the daffies, and till it was time
f- for him to remove to some higher seminary !
tc of learning. He was then sent to the U
niversity of Dublin, where he prosecuted
his studies, till fush time as, we beliete,
he took his degree of master of arts ; and
then he set out for London, intending to
study the law and qualify himfelf for the
a- bar.
id It was a lo& to himfelf, but not to the
" world, that political connexions formed by
him soon after his appearance in England,
th diverted him from tlje study of the law, a
profeffion in which a man of his astonishing
he talents could not have failed to make a
shining figure, and through which he must
K have risen to opulence and to the highest
office in the legal department.
But as in that cafe he would have bsd
en for many years the narrow theatre of the
four courts in Dublin for the difp!?'y of his
abilities, or perhaps the commons house of
;m a subordinate parliament, Ji'c might have
iet pafled through life only in his own
Lir little world, a man of considerable provin
ll." cial but not genefal reputation.
; c _ Soon after hi? Appearance in London, he
_ was to- the notice and acquaint
he ance of tb' Marquis of Rockingham, to
ch whbm. ( contrary to his own interest, he
u rar.ained attached to the end of that noble
liord's life.
The marquis loved the whig party better
than his friend Mr. Burke ; <o the former ven
he wifned to secure the benefit of this able The
man's talents ; but to the latter he did not tion
think of securing any asylum, where, in dels
the decline of life, or faculties, he might ers
fit dowm free from all worldly cares and priii
pec'.miury embarrassments. van
The negleA on the part of Lord 'Rock- britJ
inghanj might be called patriotism by the to r
Whigs"; but generous men would have ex- one
pei\ed from a generous patron either that he be
would, make a comfortable provision for a rigl
1 friend of tried fidelity, or_ that he would I
have been himfelf the firft to propose to him whi
a manumission from the (layery of -party at- intc
tachment, and advise him to pursue fortune ftre
in future ,und<? the auspices of his own as- by
toniflling talents, which could not fail to allc
lead hltti to riches and honours. btt
The Mtnyifs, hbwever, did neither ; he ded
kept hiwl t6 hitrvWf wliilft he lived ; and 1
' though he released to him by will a consider- the
' able debt, he left him greatly embarrassed tur
in his cireumftances. to
' Sach was n6t the conduA of Lord dei
1 Shelburne, now Marquis of Lanfdowne, to cer
. his protege Col. Barre. When the Roc- the
! i kingham Administration was formed on the doi
; I downfall of Lord North's, Lord Shelburne otl
â  j made it a condition of his aacepting a de- Be
â  partment in it, that his friend Col. Barre de<
â¢ ' (hould have a pension 0f3,2001. iyear, which up
f having since been exchanged for the clerk- po
s (hip of the Pells, has enabled that gentle
s j man, and we trust long will enable him> to wi
" pass his days in comfort and in splendour. foi
c The public, on a view of this cafe, will Fr
â¢ fay, either that Lord Shelburne did too to
e much forhis friend, or Lord Rockingham to
r toajittle for his. Mr. Bnrke indeed was wl
1 made Paymaster of the forces ; but a place C;
- during pleasure was not so secure as a penfi- op
on for life, as the event proved ; for he Con- ab
" tinued in the pay-office but a few months, ch
n and then went out with Mr. Fox and his ki
e party.
c It was a fenfffof honor or of fluty, or rij
d perhaps that kept Mr. Burke in
't narrow circumftanÂ«es. Had he abandoned p*
i- hiÂ» party, when it was ieferted by others, A
who, without the twentieth part of his a- H
a bilities, have fiuc* risen to opulence and ho- re
f- nors, he might have been a Cabinet Minis- hi
:e ter, and enjoyed a feat in the upper House. ,tl
He was firm, however, to his political con
-- neftions with whom honorable In
ft poverty to riches without then), till an e- ai
ir vent occurred which the Whigs had not w
forefeen. â¦ ' r
ig This event âwe mean the French revo- w
lutionâwas, by some of Mr. Burke's prin- n
v- cipal party friends, considered at a great w
e- blessing to mankind, and an accession of e
as strength to the cause of general liberty : but d
e- by him it was viewed as a fatal blow to so- n
'*â¢ ciety, to property, and to the British con- f
en ftltution. Which fide was right, we will e
to not take upon us to decide ; the cause is still e
ve depending, still sub judicc lis tjl; our chil
-101 dren, who will have Cecn the conclusion of c
ht the trial, and not be called upon to pro- f
ed n Junce till after the effe&s of the event have f
el- been fcen at\d._felt, will be better able, art
to guing i p'jfieriori, to determine the question t
â¢n- of right, than we who can only proceed to t
"lis arguments a priori. 1
es, But to proceed. Mr. Burke at his out- 1
iat let in public life gave the world a high idea (
>fi- of his taste and judgment, by his publication t
ng on " the Sublime and Beautiful," of both 1
he of which he has since furnifhed an abun- i
re- dance of models in lis Parliamentary fpeech
on es and his Political Trads. If we view him ]
:h, as an Orator, we mtift in justice to him fay, 1
ty, that in richnefa and variety of imagery, and I
an, fertility of imagination, we never knew his 1
ud equal: no man had so abundant a choice of i
be expreflions, v or so happy a talent of elucida- 1
ting a fubjeft by quotation! from authors of ;
â¢ke every age and every country, which at the
the fame time displayed the '.extraordinary re
in tentive faculties of his memory, as well as
2a- the prodiguous extent of his reading.
of Sometimes, however, he weakened his
int. fubjeft, by endeavouring to make it more
ey, clear and intelligible ; for when he hit ugfcin
ity, a metaphor, which he perceived had pleased
rve, the failey of his auditors, he pursued it
'ro- through a thousand different turnings, till
he might be laid, almost literally, to have
re- hunted it to death.
jÂ«d Still hft fl -would haye had no equal in de
nt a bate, if he had possessed less irritability of
by temper, which expofedhim to severe retorts ;
or it threw him off his guajd, and then it was,
:ca- if ever, that he was vulnerable. Hence it
lon, is, that his Political Writings, have the ad
ing- vantage over his speeches, not merely be
ruc- cause they are more poli(hed and more high
ly finilhed, but because, being more cool
! he when he wrote, he was more colk&ed, more
;ime master of himfelf, and consequently gave
lary his adversaries less opportunity of cloGng
U- with and disarming him. ,
ited Of all his writings, his celebrated " Re
ete, fleftions on the French Revolution,'' will
and ever do him the greatest honor as a compo
gto fition, indepeudent of the political merit or
the demerit of the worst. It is a naafter-piece of
almost every species of style, thefublime, the
the beautiful, the pathetic, the familiar, the fim
-1 .by pie, and the ornamental: in a word, it is
and, formed to live as long as there (hall be found
v, a on earth admirers of genius, taste and ele
(ling gance.
te a As a palitician, he afted till the 1-reuch
nuft revolution, with the whig party, so that his
;heft politics and their* were generally the fame :
he differed from them however 011 some im
hsd portant topics, and even went so far ?is to
the oppose them. The principal of these was
r his the question of parliamentary reform, a mra
fe of sure which he always lent lord North hiaaf
have fiftance to oppose ; and from which, years
own before the French revolution was
>vin- of, he apprehended fomc such consequences
here as have followed that great event in
, he France.
aint- It was a misfortune to him even in bis
so riolitics, independent of his fortune, to have
he been attached to party ; for a party man is
loble often obliged, under an idea of conhfteHcy,
to support opinions, which, if held by in
etter wen or by adversaries, he might be
_r. <â : . ..v.- 1 ? ;J; â 
very much disposed to combat and Condemn.
The principles of the w.liigs at ths revoln- Â®/wj
Jion of 1668, Â£ave always been deemed nio- bca
dels for those who pr<*fefs themlelves follow- fan
ers of that party : their conduft and their Â£
principles, however, appeared sometimes at and
variance ; but as partisans could not well con
bring themselves to allow that, they laboured the
to reconcile them, instead of admitting at in t
once that men arc fallible, and may therefore claj
be sometimes wrong as well as sometimes ivh.
right. , be
Mr. Burke was much hampered by the 1
whig principles. The turning a triennial as <
into a feptennial'parliament, was certainly Â» ny
stretch of power ; but when he considered a w
by whom it had been yade, he would not fcri
allow himfelf to cenfuve it ; and yet, on the anc
other hand, he was nttt very forward deci- wa
dedly to approve of it. pai
Mr. Fox and he have both appealed to fer
the principles of th" whigs of the last Cen- puj)
tury, to (hew that they have each adhered p'dii
to<Sthem in the present contest, It is evi- pol
i dent that they have appealed to a very un- mo
1 certain authority, as wliilft each maintained er
that he himfelf adhered to the true whig tub
; dodtrines, he as positively aflerted that the lar
r other had departed from, and abjured them. '
Between too fueh men who can venture to the
: decide? Not presuming to take such a task ere
1 upen ourselves, we will leave it whi/lly to kn
- posterity. * 1 ins
Mr. Burke has sometimes been charged | eel
d with inconsistency ; and in our opinion with
some degree of juOice. With refpeft to . raÂ«
1 Fiance, he was an Aristocrat; with refpeft !ag
0 to Trelartid, he was, iho' perhaps unknown ;gu
1 to himfelf, a Jacobin ; for the arguments : tj?
s *vhich he urged in favor of the claims of the Ith
: Catholics of Ireland, were such as, in our bi
- opinion,'juftificd not indeed murderS'and
- abominations committed in France, but the F.
5, change in the form of government in that
[3 kingdom, which admitted the great body
of the people to the enjoymerrt of political T
ir rights and a (hare in the legiSKture. J
n I The three greet featureSlof Mr. Burke's c

A comfpondent asks, why Premiums of

text for our dear allies taking our property, I
IS REMOVED? It is surprising, that
the late IMPORTANT DISCOVERY
about a diversity in the form of a role <Te- |
quipagt should not have brought Premiums
down to less than half to what they w?re
â two weeks ago. Instead of which, the ,
. price of insurance is the fame as it has been ,
lince our dear allies have taken- it into their â 
heads to rob us; which clearly proves that
our Underwriters arc firmly convinced that
plunder us they will, let the Role d'Equi- 1 (

Communication, j j
Amidst the contradidory opinions which j
agitate our learnedly medical and profound- :
ly philosophical men, refpeding the origin* (
(whether their domeftie or foreign) of the ;
epidemic, and deftrudive disorder with ]
which our cities have for several years been ,
sorely afflided; a correspondent totally un- ;
acquainted with the principles of medicine, ! (
is surprised to fee, that more attention has I ,
been paid to find out the cause, than to fug- 1 t
geft preventatives for a return of those au- (
tumnal scourges. Considering the local sit
uation of the city of New Yovk, Happily
placed between two noble rivers, it must be a
evident that canals cut from the North to '
East River, by having vast bodies/of fait c
water running with rapidity through the 1
heart of the city, would greatly tend to cor- 1
red bad air, and to carry off the filth by c
which it is' generated. In addition to the
above suggestion, as a means of securing the c
inhabitants of this city from infedive difea- t
fes, would not the ufeof coal instead ofwood, "
prove an excellent corredive of the peftilen- I
tial exhalations which arise from the quanti- 1
ty of trade ground on which a great part d
of New-York stands? . The freedom of the a
city of London from domeftie infedious dif- 11
eases, notwithstanding its immense popula
tion of upwards of a million'of people, and n
its extreme filthy streets, raulk in a great a
measure, be attributed to the general use of i,
coal, which from the sulphureous matter it p
contains, must be a powerful corredive to
bad air arrifing from the putrid exhalations .
of animal fubftanees, &c. !'
These two ideas are submitted to the con- "
fideration of those who are difcufilng the â >

t U ?. n an^wer t0 part of your lette:
1 s in which you ask, " what was done on th
'P* arrest of Aaron Gillet, by the Deputy Mai
P* fkal of the Federal Court," I mult acquair
. e you, he was discharged by order of the com
in Md here last August, and the reasons c
, c the difcltarge given by the President of th
m Ccuirt, Judge Rush. As it will no douh
afford yo\j a degree of fatisfadion to be in
I â¢ formed of the grounds on which the Cour
went in deciding so novel and interesting
cafe, I shall take the trouble of dating then
:r > to you, from very full notes I took of wha
a Â» fell from the Judge.
The Court, he said, were suddenly cal
'P led upon, on motion, to determine a queftioi
Â° of a delicate nature, which has the appear
ancc of a collision of jurifdidion between ;
Federal, and a State courtâthat want t o
ln books in the town, want of leifuie, and hi:
own indisposition, unfortunately confpircc
r " to prevent the thorough investigation of the
fubjed, which it deserved ; and he menti'
oned these circum dances, he said, as an apo
logy so r the court, in cafe it should turn 9111
1 hereafter, that they had fallen into an error
He then stated the fadsâAaron Gillet
n an inhabitant of.Luzerne county SÂ»s beer
II ai relied by the deputy Marlhal of the Fede-
IC ral court in Pennsylvania, 011 a writ of ca
n pias, to answer Resolved Sessions, Esq. of a
n plea of trespass on the cafe, and bail order
ecl dollars. From affidavit)
â¢ and authentic documents, it fully appear*
' r to the Court; that Gillet, at the time ol
the arrest, was attending here under recog
" nizance, to defend himfelf against an inqui
sition of forcible entry and detainer removed
into this court, and was also bound over to
answer for a riot.
A motion is now made to discharge him
from the,cuftody of the Marshal ef the Fede
â¢ ral court, upon the general ground, that
Â» parties and witnesses are privileged from ar
' reft, during their attendance on courts.
The constitution of the United States,
and laws made in obedience therfto, are un
doubtedly the supreme laws of our country,
to which this court will bow with refped,
whenever they are applicable to the queftioa
, before tis. But on the point noiv agitated,
Â» the constitution is silent, and the Ccngrefs have
\ never legislated. There is therefore no di
reÃ authority on the fubjed ; and in such
cafe, we mull hare recourse to general prin
-3 ciples.
[ It is an invariable rule in law, that a cause
; cannot be carried from an inferior jurifdidi
-1 on, but by an appeal, or writ of error.
r These are the only modes of removing a com
-1 plaint to r higher Tribunal.
c I But should the arrest be deemed valid in
", the present instance, a cause fairly in pof
| session of this court, may be snatched from
them, in an ob ique and indited manner ; and
its jurifdidion overthrown, in a mode whol
-1 ly novel and unprecedented.
V ' l be the duty of this court to furren
' derits suitors in all cases, and to withdraw
its protedibn in the present instance, it/would
1 be equally incumbent on us to do so, tho'
1 the party were arraigned at the bar of this, or
| any other slate- court, on a charge of felony
â¢ ! or other high crime. A dodrine that might
1 ; readily be carried such lengths, as to prove
the means of subverting entirely the jurif
didion of the state courts.
Establishing the present arrest, will have
a tendency to invite the Executive officers
of the United States, to watch the fittings
of the ftatc courts, in order to arrest persons
against whom they have legal process, instead
of going in pursuit of them, to the places
of theimabode.
WÂ« apprehend the law to be, that the
court, on which the party or witness is at
tending, has the power of affording immedi
ate relief. Instances may be found in the
books, where process has iffucd out of the
King's Beneh, and the Common Pleas have
discharged, which (hews the prin iple, that
an inferior court podefies power to prated
its own suitors and officers while attendihg it.
It is not easy to conceive how the adrni
niftration of juflice could be|Â£onduded on
any other This power must be
inherent in every courtâit is the right offelf
prefervation, without which it cannot exist.
Every court, according to the authority
in Cowper, may discharge or not, accord
ing to their difcrction, under all the circum
fiances of the cafe. And perhaps this is
right. For if it should appear there is any
abuse of privilege, the court would, not pro
ted. But there is no pretence that
Gillet had avoided the officer of the United
States, or that suits against him are fiditi
ous. We shall effedually discountenance
every fraudulent effort to find shelter, under
the cover of privilege, from the hand ofjuf
tiee ; and as effedually proted every honefl
suitor in this court, from the officers of all
other courts, 6f whatever rank, dignity, or
power.
We therefore order, that Aaron Gillet,
be discharged from the custody of the De
puty Marshal of the United States."
The following passage, if not fine poetry is, at
leuft, admirable sense, and stay he juilly applied
to all patriots Vj fro/ej/lon, of all ages and of all na
tions.
"To feiffn i red hot zeul for freedom's Cause,
To mouth aloud for liberties and laws,
For public good to bellow all abroad,
Serves well the purpoftsof private fraud.
Majors andniiror, differ in name,
Patriots an&minifters are much the fame ;
The only difference after all their root,
Is that the one is in, the other out."

me an " impertinent puppy," he wrote the

Dr. Andrew Rofs.
The bearer, Dr. BuUus not finding him

him whether or not he had called me an

but Â»ccoft<;d by Â«ie near my father'r house,
nor *Â»as there ad. omeftie present. Dr. Bul
ls lus, whose interference protected Dr. Rofs
r from a more severe chaftifemtnt than he se

attention to itscaufes and cure.âThe refiilt of his
enquiries has convinced him that the reason why f6
few persons recover from its attacks, are from its
not being well understood, and the confeqnent
wrong method taken to cure it He is persuaded
that theexceffive bleedigns and Â»T?ercvriÂ«l reatmeat
