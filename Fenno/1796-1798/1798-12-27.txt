PROPOSA S .
BY HF.N.I IN l) VIES.
Fatpublifhinz by fulfcription,aperiodical work
to be entitled The Philadelphia Magazine
and Rtview ; or, Monthly Rcpofitory of
Information and Amusement.
AFTER the many fruitlefs Â».tempts, which
have been.rnade to tflabl.ft a publication
cf this kind in Philadelphia, the proposals mow
submitted, will, perhjps, at firft fight, appear to
be nothing more than folicitii.g d fappointment.
When, hoAcver, we observe an eager fear
afrer know iedge fpreadin:' through all parts of
our countrj, awl when we conlider, that, in
these porfuits, Magazines and Reiicws are of
univj-fally-admitted utility, we are led to be
lieve, tiiat former undertakings in this way have
failed fr.,m Â£>mt other raufe than the want of
dif-ernmritt or liberality in those, to whom the
Editors looked up for support.
From causes, which are too evident to need
enumerating here, America rs, and long niufl be
beholden in a very confiderahle degree, to the
prefies of Gr..ar Britain. The llteraiure of the
two countiies is, indeed, a fort of commou
stock ; but, for one publication of ours, we re
cwve, at leafl five hundred in return. While
this is.thtLcafe, it is extreme folly in the publish
er of a periodical work, to rejefl, from a fort of
spurious pjtriotil'm, ail information, however
ufeful, and allamufemer.t, l oweverdeligFtfome,
merely because it is not of jnsauve prodinflion.
. OVvious, h -wever, as ti.e iudice of theft re
marks rtiuft appear we htiW very little doubt in
car minds, that an riiiflinate adherence ta a Con
trary notion has been t!ie prit-.cipal cause of the
want of success, experienced by those wTio have
gone before us.
Reason and interest unite in dilating to us a
different plan. The Viifce4laneÂ»us part, and
principal part, therefore, of the Philadelphia 'â¢
Afagazir.e, wiil confiftof choice feleiflions from '
the neweil publications of merit, that shall ap- I
pear in Europe ; but, particular ly from the va- '
rious perio ical works publiihed in Great-Bri
tain, of which we nave uken care to insure the
very earlier fipply. At the fame time, we trust
it ii unnecelTa > bi Ly, that we (hall always re
ceive with pleifure any original productions of
genius, rrrieor prose, of our own couiliryj
and we flatter ourfeives with the hope of being '
often favoured with the agreeable talk of giving
to fdeh produflions merited prÂ»ifes and cxten- ,
five publicity
In felctfiiig and arranging theft materials, to
suit the various taflei ofour readers, we are fen*
fible now difficidt a talk we have undertaken.
Toplealeall we do pot expefl : _it would he .a
vain preemption. But we are resolved to give
offence to none, so far as confifls with the fupe
riorrefpefl we owe to the sacred cause of reli
gion, morality, and social order. In these ate v
involved tie glery and welfare of our country, j,
and they wdll always be the Polar-liar, that lhall
guide â¢'â ur libors.
The Mifcel : any will be followed by a month-
If Summary of Aeius and politics, foreign as
well as dorneilic ; under wliich head wilt be
comprised a fuccitnfl account of the Proceedings
of the General and State Legijiatur es, and the
title?, at lead, os-all the law-, ihey (hall enaifl.
The next part of our undertaking, is a Rr
â¢vieiu, of the p>inciual works of note publirtied A
in Gjeat-Britain. For this we mull necefTarily
have rccourfc to the Review* of that country.
Though i; will be impoflible for us to furnilh as
complete an analysis is that f om which we shall
take ourinate"rialj,-wt-fhall not fail to gfve luch A
an account of every publication reviewed in that
country, as will c nvey to our readers informa
tion fifficient tncnible them to avail themselves
at a very eirly flage, of every valuable perform
ance that (hail appear. The advantages arising ft
from foch information are evident. For want c.
of it our profeflional men and men of taste are J'
always kept a year or two in the rear of those ai
of Great-Britain. We do not hear of a work tf
till a long tirpe after it is pub ilhed, and many ai
very valuable oues we never hear of at all. All p
the various injuries and privations we fuffer p
from this source will, we flatter onrfelves, be 0
entirely done away by z steady adherence to our
plan.
To that of foreign, will be added a Ilnriezu of "
J)ome/!ic Publications ; and here, we mull con.
fefs, tnat we feel fame difitdenc#, beraufe the A
execution of the task mull depend, in a great
measure, upon the abilities of ourfetvea Hj *â 
ever, with a firm rcfolution tobÂ« guided by de
cency, candour and truth, and to take genius
and vii tue by the hand, whenever, and in what
ever garb, we mSy si td tl,em ; with no wilh to "
wound tlie feelings of a fiv but the wicked, and â¢
with the mod finctie drlire of feeing our coun
â¢rymen Ihine in orery department of literature,
we doubt not, that ws (hill be able to acquit -
ourselves t > the fatisfaislioa of all those who
have the good-nature fairly to appreciate our
motives, and the justice to make allowance for
human imperfeilions,

Â®' PHILADELPHIA,
THURSDAY EVENING, DECEMBER tj.
mi- THE-FOLLOWING,
: Â°'" Are the Observations made l>y Mr. Gordon,
1W on the proposition to instruct ibe Committee
of Managers of the Impeachment of IVil
liam Bioun'., to request of the Senate, that
- the attendance of said Blount might be com
pelled.
,f a Mr. Gordon fiid, Gentienieu fees-ntx!
ble to have taken up an idea that the object of
iit the resolution was to declare to the Senate
ln " what mode ought to be purfuecf by them
ale with rcfpect to tiie prosecution which is be
at' fore them, and not whether this house
would apply to the Senate to take further
(laps for the appearance of Mr. Blount. He
believed there was a gre<rt difference between
>e( j the two objedts ; for he did not think, that
by the latter, the houie proposed to deter
mine what belongs to the constitutional pow
er of the Senate.
111 what. Situation is this bulincl's before
the Senate ? The people of the United States
have charged Mr. Blount with high crimes
and mifekmeanors against the Un ited States.
They have requested that ftcps might be tak
en to bring him before the Senate. The Se-
LS ' nate have complied with this request, and
have informed this houle, that he has not
appeared.. What is to be the next ftcp ?
not this house as pr'ofecutor to Come
forward and requcft that further steps may be
taken to bring this man before them that he
-c ma,y be to eiTe<sl ? What is the
practice at common law, when a process lias
faijetl to produce its objeifl ? When a Ca
pias has been filed out to apprehend a criminal
and it ha.s sot been lerved, is rtot the next :
step to be taken by the prosecutor? There !
is therefore, said he ; a peculiar propriety in ;
the House going on to request that a personal !
~ attendance my be compelled. This;* inltead
of dictating to the Senate, would BÂ« proceed- '
ing in the usual and ordinary courle of thing?.
The queilion, Mr. G. said, appeared' to be
whether or not this is a criminal prosecution.
~~ If "it be a criminal prosecution, all adroit that i
a personal appearance of the accufedis necef- 1
y fary at his trial. But it is denied that it is :
a criminal prosecution, and it is therefore
contended that a different ceurfe may be had.
n What, said he, is a criminalprr ferution ?
* It is charge by the government against a citi-
P for viulatipg a law or laws made for fe
ll curing the-peace, welfare, or interest of the
community, and profecitted before a tribunal i
e competent to decide upon the fame. Here,
3 then is a charge by the United States againil
' a citizen, this charge CO..fills of fundryhigh '
crimes and misdemeanors, of offences against
the laws of the United States, dirtily tend- ;
ing to involve their peace, interest and wel- '
fare. This offence is prosecuted before a tri
bunal competent to make the enquiry and
, pronounce a judgment thereon. The pro-
fecution has, therefore, every reciuifite of a
criminal process.
1 his definition of a criminal process, Mr. â¢
Or -feai, "guMul ; u is 1
there not, then, a charge of a criminal na
tu^ e ," is stated to be for high crimes and -
mnoemeanors. Is it not brought before a
competent tribunal ? It certainly is. Can
not the Senate proceed to judgment upon it :
they are bound by the Constitution foto do.
1 here is therefore, every requisite which con
lhtutes a criminal prosecution. Will itftill 1
be said that this is a civil and not a criminal
process. Jt f c , it must be maintained that
it u the judgment and net the offence, which ?
cor.ftitutes a criminal prosecution, Admit
the idea that the criminal code is entirely al- [
tered ; that tor all offences against the laws '
ot the united States, no other judgment d
Jail be Teadenw xhan .that of difqualification 11
ot officg ; suppose that by the common law, P
a judgment never operated against a person, S
but only against his estate ; it would follow, u
that neither by the laws of the United States 81
nor at common law, could there be any such c
thing as criminal jurifprudente. Will it be 0
laid that the Umted States could not lb frame fl
their laws as to exclude any punishment of n
the person ; and yet if this ihould take place, 11
according to the ideas of Gentlemen, ou,
cnminal law would be no more. But, said d '
/c ' ' S Â°, ot thc Qualification to hold a '
an office under the United States, or a re- fe
rnova l from one, a punishment ? If a man "
hold an office during good behaviour, it is a
f-~ Â° ' a 11 when a man cc
forfeits a freehold, and * dive (led of it, he ,:f
uiftot punatbed ? Certainly not. Another
X 'on has been made and almost every ot- so
jection ls refelved into this, viz. that the ob
propeled apphcation involves inconvenience Â»*Â»i
and a procraflmation of the trial. The :{ en- be
tleman from \ .rgmia has said that it might
y r lftratt the impeacfuttb.,t, and pre- h;
vent a judgment from beit.g obtained. This of
dec a mio h fajd> muU madc â
without conhderation, because if theprefent fe
aÂ«s are not Efficient for the purpose, it hi
cotld uot be said that more efficient provifiors p<
could not be made This remark he illuf- fc
trated by a reference to the law establishing re
e judiciary. Mr.G. denied that there is any ar
analogy between this Â«afe and a suit in rem in tl
ttte civil aw , and that the argiunent used by ec
. e gentleman from Connecticut refpefting di
he admission of bail ln certain cases, instead o(

Is now handing about for the signatures of
1 the citizens.
To the Szjutb and Hovszif Rtnssrv.
VAtitrms vf tbe Commencealib of /W
ST/harua, :n General Assembly met,
: he Representation and Petition of the Sub
fenbers, members of a Society for the sup.
preflion of Vice and Immorality, and also
of other citizens-os Philadelphia, and its
vicinity,
Respucrrutir Shewed,
1 HAT your petitioners observe with
sincere pleasure, that their ftllow citizens
are uiing various means to preferveour city
from recurrence of those pellifential visi
tations, which for more than five years past,
have produced amofiglt us scenes of the
deepest c 3 fftre fs and anxiety, and which
thiraten with extinftion the ooulencr and
prosperity of the metropolis of the United
States. We desire to express in the mod
unequivocal manner our approbation of thffe
aims and endeavours, our mt>ft cordial coj
currence in ihem, and our r adinels to eoÂ«
operate in rendering them eff-&i*e ; being
fully persuaded that to negleft the meant
naturally calculated to prevent the deftriic
tior, of life and evidence r f diftnfs; is ei
ther an instance of criminal fupincnefs, or of
daring preemption. But whil* we possess
and avow these fent/menfs we thi k it per
fedlly confifteat to declare, that Â«ur views
are directed to a higher power than thai
which is human, to crown with success the
contemplated exertions for the preservation
-of our city ; and that unless we secure tbe
favour and blessing of the Supreme Pifpo
fer of all events, our desires to obtain this
object will be vain, and our efforts unavail
ing. We believe, and Â» earÂ« conllrafued
before the Legislature of the state to pre
fefs the beliefâthat the Most Hieh GOD
has " a controversy" with the inhabitants
of our land and city ; and that till they
" consider their wÂ«ys," ar.d 'i turn their
felves from their trai fgreffion," we fliill
have reason to fear " that iniquity will
prove their mint" we (hail have leafon to
fear that we may be left to infatuation
remifT. ess, in regard to the measures which
are bed calculated, in the natural < rdÂ«r of
things, to prevent the rtturn cf the dread
ed disease; or that, if these meafurei are
devffed and adopted, " He who ruleth
over afi" mav (as without a miracle he cer*
tainly can) prevent their success ; or that,
if fhey are adually fuccefsful. he mijrem
ploy some other, and perhaps mure awfi <
means, cf chadiCng the violators of hit
laws.
Deeply and solemnly jmprtfTcd with these
i momentous truths, your petitioners are dc
firous, with all becoming refpeft, molt ear
nellly to solicit the attention of their lcgif
iators and rulers, to the moial, as well a>
kQ the njlurut caufc* of the calamities which
| we have expericuced; and to reqoeft that,
: while the latter are cÂ»n(idcred. tire fbrmtT
may npt be forgotten; but that by a f'lita
ble and connefted regard to both, the four
daiiori <tf a rational expeilation may be laid*
that, under the smiles of heaven, *e reafiraln er.ioy a t <la eof health and :
urofperity- F t,r be V from us to petition 1
or desire thÂ»t the Le(f flature (houtd, tn the j
I degree, interfere with the rights of -
roiifcience, so properly secured to every in
dividu.l by th* conflitutions of Pcnnfylua
nia aod r>f the United States : But, withia
eonfti'Utioual limits and jnft bounds of leg
fflative autliority, there are certain great
and leading principles of moral and religi
ous obligation, which the very existence of
conscience, or a moral faculty in the human
mind, must fuppofr, and a regard to which,
not only the peace, order and happinef*â
but the very existence of civil society, in- ]
difperifably requires. The'enforcement of '
a lacred regard to ihefe principles, both by
the influence of their own eximpl-, and by i
ena'fting and executing suitable laws for the
j:qrpo/e, vour petitioners conceive to be ndt
merely within !he province cflegidators and 1
but amo"g their mod impor
tant and indifptnfable duties. With this
' impr-ffion we do eameltly intreat, that the
Legislature of Pcnnfylvania would fpeedi'y
' adopt the mod efficient measures for sup
pressing all those jils of atrocious wicked
ntfs, which, have too long abounded in the ,
midll of us; and especially of floppii.g, as ,
far as pnffible, the fourcen of that profane ,
ness debauchery, difTolutenefs of manners,
and criminal di'ffipatiou, which both trom
( their natural tendency, and by provoking
I tf e righteous jadgmeins of a Holy GOD, i
threaten US wi'Ji dellrufiion.
Your petitioners are ef -ecially dtfirous
in this add-refs iÂ©f calling the attention of
the Legiflatura, seas nab'y and ferioudy, to
' the palling of an act more effeÂ£lu?lly and
generally to provide for the suppression of
vice and immorality ; a draft of which was'
. made at their former sessions, and which,
after being read and printed, was left, ?s !
your petitioners have been informed, on the
files of the House rf Renrefentativej. And
your petitioners are highly folici'ous, that
jn this ad the molt effetfive pro ifion may
be made to tnfure ltÂ« execution, by those
â whose duty it fliall be to enforce it ; because
the inexecution of laws of his is !
among the weigh'ieft grievances which y -ur ;
petitioners have to deplore ; and, as they j
believe, is among the mod cryng fins with,
which our city and land are chargeable.

IN your second publication in the Gazette
lc of the United Stat.s, last Saturd ly, you Sffert !
33 that u thtfirst cases" of tbt late fever
e traced to the ship Deborah, which arrived at
! > Philadelphia on the iSth July, oil board of
m which Co vera} persons died during her passage
g from J remie to this port, and one of her 1
; > crew at the Marine Hofpitul soon after htr '
arrivnl." i
us That the fever wa; in various parts of
of Philadelphia before th;arrival of the Deborah,
to appears from the letter of the Academy cf
id | Medicine, to Governor Mifflin, published a
of few days lince. In that letter the names and
as places of abode of persons arc given,
h, who had thedifeafe before the arrival of the '
?S : Deborah.
Ie You fay " while the Deborah was pel'-1
id forming quarantine, Alexander Philips ac
at knowledged to Mr. Purdon and Mr. T-nvne, 1
'T t ' iat he brought up a sick man from onboard
fe a vessel layfng- at the fort." Â« Mr. I Milnov 1
fe informed Mr. Purdon, that Philips told him
is! | he brought a man from the Deborah the last
ur : night of her jjvarantine, who was taken sick
:y ]on the ad, and died on the 6th- August." !
th Without dwelling upon the folly evinced
by Philips, in pubJHhing a Ifory which he
well knew would occasion his being heavily
fined, I will just mention that Mr. Milnor
; denies haying ever made the assertion above
related on his authority.
ir * | It was fully ascertained by the Board of
c - Health, that the man by name Ralflon, who
, is said to have worked on board the Deborah,
"s and died very yellow on the fifth day from
to th - attack, had been taking Mercury Yor lip
to wards of five weeks before, and when verv
feeble had gone to work, but was obliged to
rft leave off; and that the caule of his fever
p- was the labor being difproportioned to his
â y strength, and a violent cold taken by chop
"n P'Â»g wood during a rain, after lie came
n- home.
n- The carpenter attended by Dr. Currie at
a- A. Thompson's, in Water, below Walnut
ftreet, declared to Mr. T. that he had not
beeijr more than five minutes on the gunnel
* .* UtÂ«M. Ihip AM b"Cn
as full of contagion as a Have ship, be could
! not have frarcely taken a difeal'e from this
short exposure in the open air.
" Alexander Morrifon, who is said to have
( died m the fame houle, on the 2Sth July,
j after having appeared like one intoxicated
I for two days," was declared by his pliylicran
to the coroner, to have died of the " cramp
in his flomach." The-.fatVwns, that the man
had been actually stupid with liquor during j
the above period, as Mr. Thompson afierts. !
That he. did not die of the fever, will appear
from the coroner's inqueif.
You fay that "David Sparks affirms that
Philips got liquor from him before the D.-b- i
S orah came up, and told biin it was to take ' ,
| with him, as he was going to bring up one I ,
"â¢ of his old Ipdgers from the Deborah."
ms Mr. Sparks positively denies ever having |
to sa :d that Philips declared his intentions of
si. bringing up -a person from the ibi!>. And ,
d that Philips did not go on board, appears ]
la " from the declaration of Mrs. Doyle, his |
neighbour, who fajrs. that Philips asked her, ,
>rs when he was going down, whether (lie would ,
pot fend some liquor to a friend on board ; ,
B- to which flie replied, that flic would not ,
Â°' r | and when Philips returned, lie told her that
â¢ he had been refilled permission to go on board;
â  e fÂ° careful was the captain to avoid all coni
munication with the city while his fliip was
h- in quarantine. The contradiction between
Â°f the dates, proves the inaccuracy of your
statement. Philips pure haled the liquor to '
e '_ take with fern on the loth Julyâand you *
fay he went down and brought up the lick '
Â»e man the day before tlie expiration of the 1
id Deborah's quarantine, which happened on '
j. the 18th July !! It is, moreover, improba- p
ble that Philips was on .board, because the '
captain of the Deborah, Mr. Edward Yard, f
having lieen in the Weft-India trade several r
years from this port, knows that a heavy 'â 
penalty attends the granting pcrmiflion to '
auy one to rome on board during quarantine;
but I may further mention, that the widow 1
of A. Philips, is willing to be qualified that
her husband never brought ifp any sick ner
: fan from the I Deborah. Abraham Small.
wh Â° w ' nt with Philips down to the Debofah,
d will alio prove that Ue never went on board
ft that vessel. t
You fay that," A Tho mp (%n and John r
=t Doyle, neighbors to Philips, affi-.t that he c
' sailor frwi the Deborah to his f
house. B<:th theft- men declare, they never c
..a, ' the faft from their own knowledge, r
" Ihe above fefts tend strongly to disprove t
the aiiertion, that Philips brought up three t
h irom the Deborah. Moreover, none of t
the persons said to have taken the disease c
from going on board the Deborah, commit- c
n n 'catea it to those in the fame house with
f- them ;_ 3 . circumJlaiKe which is deciflvs in t
its authority, that no human contagion was c
derived from that by "those who are J
h (uopofed fiiil to have taien ill by beinz on r
t . bc.rd of her. ' b J
Finally, admitting the faÂ«s\ that Philips t
Jrcught up three men, or twenty rath, all e
I ill of veUaw Â£rvfr,~the flrigth cf th?
1 ffv*r cannot lie ascribed, by any reasonable
Iperfon, to the cof.taÂ»Son corrTnur.icat-d by
them, when it isconfidered that the most in

i Lepift?ture, that strengty marktdr

â upon my authority, that the late Mr.Phi!!'"! '
t brought up a fickman from th: Deborah, I
( never didafTertthe fact from my own know- 1

1 MR. FENNO
IN your paper of last Saturday I observe
, the following para raph in a piece refpeâ¬ling
the origin of the late Fever, viz. ' Mr. I. j
_ Milnor informvd Mr. Purdon that Phillips
told h-iin that he told him he brought a man
from the Deborah the last night of her qua
-1 rantine, who was taken sick on the 2d and :
died Â»n the sth of i\yguft."
, Thi< statement is not accurate.âln a
| eoriveifation with Mr. Purdon at the Spread i
Eagle, 00 the L*neÂ»fter Road, onthefub
jett of the Fever, during its ptcvalence, I
{ mentioned to him that I utiderftood it could
: be proved from the confefEon of Phillips
, himfelf, that he brought up a man from the
,â  Deborah, but I did uot assert the fad upon
; the authority of Phillips, forlneverex
changed a word with hira in my life ; I did
f' riot even know himâwhat 1 told Mr. Pur
i don was founded upon a conversation with
, Mr. R. Jackson, one of the Infpedtors of
1" the Customs, a (hort time before, whÂ® men
- 'tioned the above in the Surveyor's Office.
.â¢ Upon since applying to Mr. Jackson upon
3 this subject he states that Thomas Town,
1- Millwright, of the North.rn Liberties told
s him that Phillips had declared to him that
- he brought up three men from the Deborah
; previous to her arrivi/ at the Fort.
I do not wish to insinuate that Mr. Pur
t don intentionally mifrcprefented my infor
mation ; I have no doubt that he related the
t faÂ£t agreeable to the impression made upoa
l his mind, hut the above "Is the exaÂ£t ttate
i ment I made to him, in the course of a ve
-1 ry {hort conversion, while my horse and

Magistrate to exhaust all thefources of con

length, violated the. laftprinciples of decen

uses the language of affeftion and friendlhip.
Let that language be discarded until the mi!-

tyranny under vhich they and are
