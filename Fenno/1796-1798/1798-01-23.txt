SCIPIOâNf. XIII.
It woyld be neithcrufeful nor entertaining
to rcrairk on thecommunictittons which pafl
ed between our nriiuiftar and the direQoty,
| relative to the British treaty, after they had
told him they had made up their mind h+iv to dB.
â  He feern/ to have been afraid to i;eprefent
the sentiments of the Executive on this
fubjeft; apprehending they might be difa
greeabte to the directory, and thern
lulpedl his peifonal devotion to their wtK
which, on so. tnany Bccafions he had mani
felted. By this timidity, he must have con
trtbuted to alarm their jealousy, and not to
appease ft. While he pretended to juflify
and support the Executive in refpeft to the
treaty, he appean *o have diftri/jled the
goodness of hit cause,. and by this diffidence
to ha*e animated the discontent of France.
I (hall pass over the uncertaiwties, contrari
eties and idle conjeftnres to te fouod in his
letters to the Secretary of State, They
may have been meant-tcr keep the; mind of
the President in anxious andpainful
or they may have been designed tojeave the
ex-minister at full liberty, at a futUre day,
to join in supporting that nation in demand
ing an abrogation of the treaty with Britain.
If he haÂ«To dubiously, so jefuitically, & in
fmctrely defended tfje measures of America
in relation to foreign naions, and particular
ly the treaty with Britain, that he can now,
without inconfiJlency advocaU the proceed
ings of Frances %11 men must agree, he has
been the unfaithful reprefentativÂ« ef the
Urtited States. Will any perfiin doubly
after reading Mr. Monroe's pamphlet, on
which fide he now stands in the controver
sy between Prance and his native country.
He has avowed his objeA in his publication
to be, to denounce the Executive for what
he calls injustice andperfidy towards France.
He has recapitulated no less than Â£ourteen ;
chargestomake goodhis denunciation, runn
ing over a period of several years which em
braces the whole fpaee of his miniflry at Pa
ris. Is it pbfflble that Mr. Monroe could
have truly and cordially endeavoured to fulfil
the views of the President as the minister of
the United States to tht French republic, if
he differed from him in sentiment, and dis
approved of his maafures, or fufpe<Â£Ud his
objefts? How can it be reconciled, that he
remained more than two years in a ministry
fubjeft to the direftion of the President, and
for aught that appears, w6uld have willing
ly remained for ever if in his*power; and
that when he has been recalled, he has writ
ten a book of accusations against his employ
er, in which, he endeavours to proVe that,
relative to France, the Executive has been
either untoife, or unjust, or dishonourable,
and hasfurm'fhedjuftcaufeforthe
of that nation? After this, is it surprising
that citfzen Barras, President of the direc
tory, in the valedictory delivered to Mr.
Monroe at his taking leave of France, Ihould
have taken that occasion to pronounce an in
ve&ive against our President, and an eulogy
011 ourminifter? Did not this deroonftrate
that thediredlory believed the fentimefcts of
the roinifter and of the President to be at
variance, and that the former had been sub
servient to the views of France? Else, why
were the direftery disposed to permit Mr.
Monroe always to remain in his ministry,
why have they not only to receive,
but even to hear his successor, gen. Pinck
ney, than whom, no American truly at
tached to the good of his country, could be
less exceptionableâwhy, at this moment
have our envoys been so long delayed,
or perhaps sent back without an audience?
To them no personal obieftion has been, or
can be made. The only answer that occurs
to me, to these questions is, that France,
having so long been indulged with a minister
moreufeful to it, than to America; ami-'
who did every thing to infriire the di
lrftory with confidence in him, but nothing
to inTpiic them with confidence in the Ex
' ecutive, a minister who represented himfelf
to that, in proportion as he disregarded tta
itittrefts of this government, was dtfpleafed
at his recall, and may have taken up the o
pinion that (he is intitled to have at all times
a minister from America, equally condescend
ing, obsequious and fubmiflive. In thepre
<ent difagreefnent between the two nations,
if an argument more forcible than the reft
to fuppoVt the iff. of the Executive in re
moving this minister was fought for, the
panegyric of citizen Barras on our minis
ter's condu<S would furnifh it.
To confirm statement which I have
made of Mr. Monroe's negligence refppft
ing the British treaty, I must present to the
public an extraft from the letter of the se
cretary of state to him, dated' 13tft Jurte,
1795- It is as follow? : Â« But the princi
pal matter which now demands attention is
what concerns the late treaty between the
United States and Great Britain.
" Of the views of the government of the
United States on this fubjeft, you have long
since been possessed as well before as subse
quent to its ratification. These view* were
communicated to yoH for the sole purpose of
fumifhing you with the means of removing
â  objections and difpeUing jealousies. By
your own representations both' objeftions
and jealaufies existed. It has been there
fore a matter of no small surprize to the
President, th.it during folopg a period you
contented yourfelf merely with having those
means iu your pofleilion without' applying
them to the objeft for which they Were
transmitted.
" As early as Oftober last you predicted
that if Mr. Jay's treaty (hould be ratified,
it would excite great discontent in France.
Early in November you mentioned the ar
rival of Mr. Fatichet extremely diffalisfied
with the treaty ; adding that he was well
received and would therefore be attended
to. On the 6th December you acknowl
edge <Ke*receipt bt n:y lettei of Seplcmber
12tfi, written f.*bfeqÂ«culv to the ratifica
tion of the treaty, to repeat and further
explain the principles and views of the go
vernment concerning it. Mr. Adet's ob
jections to the treaty 8Â»d their refutation
accompanied my letter. And with such
alcana in your hands, means amply fufficient
to vindicate the conduit of the Ujiiled
States, notjefs regrcniian surprize is exci
ted thsf no attempt was madt; to apply them
to the highly itnportant use for which they
were sent. Although you anticipated dis
contents, although the symptoms of difcon
teot appeared, although these fymptÂ»ms!
unatteuded tu and unallayed mig'tin'ncreafe
foan iiiflamfliiition, and Mr.Fiiu liet'sarrival
with all his diffatisfaction and prejudices a -
boat htm would affwredly add to the irrita
tion ; yel you were- silent and inadtive, un
til, on thf 15th Fel>fU9ry you were alarmed
'by'the project Â»f the direi.'torj' accidentally
comiW>uicated to you ; by. the minister of fo
reign aflfeirs of femling to this, country an
envoy extraordinary'to represent to our go
vernment their decision concerning the trea
ty with Great Briton, " that they consid
ered the treaty of alliance between us as
ceaiing to exist from the moment the treaty
was.iatified." Your letter of the 20th of
the Jfame month, describes your fe?ond in
terview with the minister on the projedt of
fendiug an envoy extraordinary, and the
reasons yoti urgjed to dissuade them from it,
were certainly very cogent. Your letter
of the 10th March, informs us the projeft
was laid aside, and your letter of the 25th
of 'March, that you had an audience of the
diredtory on the fubjeft, and that they had
agreed to suspend tp propefe their proposed
extraordinary million, until the points ih
question fhotrld be dffcwffed between you
and .rhe minister for foreign /affairs. The re-
Jult this audience appears fathfuctory, and
fromtfhc good esseS produced by the partial ex
planations then given, may be the hap-
P> confequtncetofthe full communications which I
might have beyt made, and which forfo long a

Thai these â¢were not made, that they had not I
betn.. made even so late as the 2 sth of March,
is again to be extremely regretted, because the
jujlice, t)oihonÂ»r and the faith oj tur country,

reign lelitions being placed in the hands of the
executive, a/idalLour correspondence with fo
reign nations being through him, were strong
circumstances in favor -of the poGtion. But it'
bad-been said, as the power of reg\ilatinj; faU-i

ing a low salary a finally reduce the grade from
whit thepreEdent had'cftabiilhed ; and our go
veriimen't had b< en said" to be* a government of
checks and bailees. He Taid this brought iii
to vie* an old topic of difcuflion which was
to him riot a matter of regret. The great land
mirks of onr constitution coYld not be 109 clear
ly afcertsined, and from the importance and in
tricacy of the fubjefl, it could hardly be too often
ilifcufled. That onr's was a government Of
checks and balances in a certain sense he Would
admit, tbotjgh, not hy any means in the feufe
contended for by gentlejnen. He said the gov
ernment was.d vided i#to three principal 'Je
partonents, the Executive, the Legislative, and
the Judiciary ; e*eh ofthefe had in it checks.
The pnrMer.t in the ejrteutive department was
clrtekwt tfr rtie fcr.att ; in the legislative de
partmyr.t the senate, the house of reprcfenta
tives aRd the qualified approbation of the Pr>-
Hdent were reciprocally checks upon each other,
hi the judiciary, certain appeals of writs of er
-101 'were provided as checks. Bui that one of
these f rrat departments was designed by the
conilituimn to check another by relufmg to afl,
he altogetlifr denied. Indeed the arts of each
r were ntceftary in order tâ give force and effftfl
<0 the other. The legislature would in vain
, make laws if the executive might refufe to pn'
them in lorce, or ..if rhe j'.dicjar.y niight disregard
. them ; and equally vain is it ior the executive
|j to exert himfe/for the good of the nation in
. Tin tegularcQnttitutionahfurÂ«flions, if the leeif
j lature will withhold from Mm its aid. He said
1 so far from this, the three departments Ihould
â¢â¢j move mptrrfeta utlifan ; they (howld move with
â¢is Â«iÂ«c:i regularity as the rtaHcHiiKry Â»f a eloÂ«kÂ»
each part fupportmg the others ; a*4 the n>

to exercise its cÂ«nftitution*l funAioils, in ord?r
to (five force and eIT.-fl to the regular Â£Â»nftitÂ«-
tinnal aisls of the o.hers, the utmost disorder
inult pervade our whole political marhioe. No
one apartment cÂ»u'd be cit.fidered as the fa
vorite of the constitution, b>jt the lame oblerra
tiorw -were applicable to the who';. 1' wis nat
in Â»he power of the legiflatur* to reverse a Cn
gle deciflon -of the lowefl court acting under
the laws of the United - States.
If filch a decifi in waÂ« to minifeftly wrong aÂ«
to prove corruption in file joii-je*, still the legis
lature could do no rrrjre than impeach the jndgr
I ei ; while they cannot Under any-pretext inter-,
ftre with the He alked if this was
admitted, whether the house will allume the
po*;r of judging over tfie head of the lupreme
executive in marters within his province. He
apprehended the true /ate to be this, that whea
â¢vcr the regular con ffitutional ails of one deÂ«
partineut come l4cidÂ«ot*4ly lirfoic another, no
enquiry .8 to be their policy y,r pro
-priety, but they are presumed for the bc't The
executive had found it iutlifpenfable to eftabMh
a minister at Berlin, and to raise the grades of
thole at Ivflion and Madrid- Â£t was ttie duty
of the legilHture to pt-ovide filarieÂ» : in duing
this they might enquire relative to the expeace
of living at each court, and the stile of living
proper for ait American minilter to alfume ; and
indeed any other considerations except the pro
priety of eftaMifhing them, their grades and their
appointtrtents. These, he said, were futijecfU
which (hÂ»uld be laid aside m their deliberations,
being already fettled by the regular constitu
tional authorities for the purpose. It had been
(aid that this power in the executive would give
hjp an influence,over the legislature. He con
ceived it a fuflicient anfvver to this argument to
fay such was the constitution- It therefore had
no other efteft than what was probably designÂ«
ed by the framers of that instrument. It was,
however, worthy of remark, that the advocates
for the ablblute controlof the house of represen
tatives ovi.- th* executive, generally founded
their arguments rather upon what tney suppose ;
deftHs in the cenjlitition, than on the obvious
meaning of the canftitntion itlilf. In the room
of'contending for a gemiine fair conftruillon of
it, they contend againll it as it as it is. He was
ready to admit that thof'e gentlemen were nf o
pinion the constitution had giveo coo much pow
er to the executive, and this as far as it went
might be their excule ; but they ihould bring
forward an amendment in the regular constitu
tional way : and he presumed gentlemen would
do this, did tbey not know its probably, fate.
I< had been said that prefidctit had already
abused this power by appointing to office gen
tlemen of the fame political with
himfelf. This had been called " executive pa
tronage," and the present majorities in the two
houfesof congress fetmed to be attributed to the
overgrown influence of the executive. It had
also bzen said, the executive had determined in
future not to appoint any gentleman to office
whose political opinions did not coincide with
his own. That the executive had formed the
resolution attributed to him ffe Was .ready to
admit, because he theught it was high time
such a determination was made- Coald
it be contended with all our preferrt ex
perience that it was proper to have a di
plomatic agent who, regardless of his duty,
could place himfelf at the head of a faftion
in opposition to those from whom he receiv
ed his appointment ? Could it be proper to
have an executive agent in office who, har
bouring sentiments hostile to the govern
ment could secretly defeat the very meafurei
he publicly advocated ; " initiating" a fo
reign mini llfr-into certain 'i hold
ing " an official language and a language con
fidential"? Can it indeed be proper to have
in office a man who irtakes " preciqtts confejji
ons"? Mr. Smith said, thf position this
country had affumcd during the present Eu
ropean war, was one of all others the most
difficult to support even in. absolute govern
ments. A neutral state mnft be supposed
to excite the jealonfy of all the belligerent
parties; but in a.republican government
where every individual may freely indulge
himfelf in political speculations, and where
some may be found unnatural enough to use
their utmost exertion in exciting the jealous
ies and suspicions of one of the powers at
war, the situation is rendered still more com
plicated and embarrassing. In such a state
of things it was ps the utmost importance
that the Executive and ministers (hould go
heart and hand together ; that the minister
(hpuld feel an interest in reconciling foreign
nations to the adts of government, that
tfeey should feel zealous ip their attempts to
banish suspicions and restore harmony when
ever there may be the least interruption Â®f
it, and not use every effort to wide* the
.breach between our government and a foreign
nation in order to " draw elofer the bands of
union between an inveterate faction in this
country and such foreign powers. He said
while he admitted thatthe cxecutivehad late
ly, and probably would for the future ap-'
point to office such only as were of (imilar
political sentiments with himfelf, (which he
admitted because he thought such conduft
proper and not because he knew any thing
about it) he would riot admit that the Pre
sident ever fele&ed a member of the legifla
Â« ire for the purpose of influencing their con
dutt, nor would he admit that it ever had
or would in this country have any influence
pn the legislature. It was well known that
salaries were low, lie believed, designed
merely for support, with a very moderate
compensation for the time they,were neces
sarily employed in public service; but if
gentlemen could Ihow that salaries weit so
high as tp render offices objects of competi
tion he would join them in a reduction of a -

The wines drank at the entertainments of
theChinefe, have no resemblance to those D'
of Europe, either in taste or quality. They dah I
do not procure tbetn from the vine, but frotri W
rice of a particular kind. The method of Smh
preparing this wine is, to lay therice to steep days
far twenty or thirtydays inwater, into which his v
ingredients, of a different nature, as fancy hofps
may di&ate, are fucceflively thrown. It is Y<
afterwards boiled. As soon as it becomes the y
difiolved by the heat, it immediately feral pi;
ments and throws up a vaporous scum, not labor
much unlike that of new wines.-. A very add 1
pure liquor is.found under this scum, which
is drawn off;"and poured into earthen vessels ' ,1 '
well varnished. Of the remaining lees a spi

Articles of Impeachment against William
Blount, dated January 19, 1798.
Philadelfrh'm, ltyb January, 1798.
Sir,
| Having seen by the fupplemcntary report gij
of the committee which you laid before the rhr
' houfc on Thursday the 18th inft. that A- Deft
braham Holden has declared that J- P. Rip- BA '
1 ley had received from me a sum of money
in New-Yotk, to extricate him from a dif- Ij|fu
ficulty in whieh he found himlelf, I think it
3 an indifpenfabk duty I owe to myfelf, to
Â® prove the total of the faft
by the following ftaUment. Towards the ala
l ' latter end of last September, >on my return
at New-York, from Boftort,. I was informed q _
that Mr. Ripley had been irrefted for debt,
and That by the interpofitioQ of Governor
c Jay he had been prevented from going to
n prison. Mr. Ripley (hortly after applied to <
S a merchant in New-York for a sum of mo- fl pt
rs ney in order to extricate himfelf finally from. y c
7' this ertibarraffment, the gentleman applied
to me 'for information refpefting Mr. Rip- tfn
y ley, and on my telling blui I had every rea- g ,
r " son to consider hitti as a ybung fljan of honor 10[
le integrity, he advanced him in his notet, I Q f ,
the money he required, the amornt of which j n
3 Ido not exadUy recoiled. Moreover, I
think it necessary here to obferte to you fir, tQ
that from the firft moment of ny acquaint
ance with Mr. Ripley, I neVer have direftly ,
'* or indircftly, offered him any money oro- | jj,
ther reward, or in any ways hflited to com- t jj a
3t penfate him for his deposition, as he was u j t
confeious it was his d(ity, arid in that light qj.
" only have I viewed it. I haire further rja- u r
c . r son to believe this motive was the only in-
1 ' ducement he had to apply to me, at the at
:- a commencement of the fitting of the com- [
mittee as it was an entire voluntary aft of
L ' Ills â¢w'tl. "I** '
As the deposition of Mr. Holden has f r] -
Â°* been laid before congress, permit me, fir, f u j
r torequeft of the committee to do the fame
Â°i, with this letter, and, if necessary, to take
f t the proper steps for the further elucidation |-
11 of the above-riieatibned faft, in order to on
