A very valuable Merchant Mill,
A DISTILLERY and BREWERY, andfundry STONE
QUARRIES to -be let
I will rent my merchant Mill at the little Falls of Po
towmac, for any term not less than seven, nor more than
elcTen years, from the firft' day of September next. The
mili-houfe is 42 by 40 feet, three flories high, built with
stone, and has in it three pairs of French Burr Stonesi two
oVcr'lhot 18 water-wheels, and Evans's machinery
complete, with every other thing proper and necessary for
carrying on the business with difnatch, and at as little ex
pense as poffi'ok, all in good orderâFrem the mill to my 1
landing on the Potomac river, (whs re craft, of any bur
then may deliver grain and take in flour) it is about 4c '
yards, and from thenc-- by water to George-Town and '
the City of Wafnington, about 3 miles, t and to Alexan- '
dria about nmiles. This situation, aided by a fuflicient 1
capital,' will command the produce of a very extensive '
back country, where large quantities'of whearand other '
grain is annually'made, the diAance to it being from 8 â 
to 10 miles leL than to any market town upun the navi- '
gation of the Potown ac. There are 011 the preruifes a '
large stone Coopers* Ih jp, a ftone'granary, and acommo- 1
dioui miller's house. At the landing aforefaid a bridge , i
is now building over the Potomac, which is in great for- j '
wardnels and probably will be finilhed the ensuing fail. I 1
There are also on the premises, a Brewery md DilUlle- j '
ry.' built with itone, in them are three stills, two coppers
or boilers, with every necessary article, all new, and in 1
good ordsr, and fufftcicntly large to carry on the Brew- '
ery and Diftillei y upon a very extenlive plan. This prop- '
erty I vl'ill rent for the fame term of years. *
Upon my lauds, achoining the premises, and along the '
banks of the river, where craft may lead with cafeand dif- 1
patch, is an immense quantity of building and fou'nda
tion-ftones. Four quarries are now Open, and ,as *liany 1 '
more may be opehed with ease : the stone taken from these 1
quarries is better, and has the preference â at this market , !
II an/"ether stone brought to it. I will rent t,hefe-quarries i
separately or together as may bell suit.
On the top of the hill, and about 200 yards from the j
; mill, is a stone Dwelling-house, large enough for rhe ac- '
commodation of a family ; also, a kitchen, dairy, (moke- M
house, &c. and a garden, encÂ»ofed and ip cuttivancfa, the
foi of. whieh is equal in goodness to any in this Hate, i
will also rent this property.
Adjoining to the Brewery and Diftiilery is a Smith's
ill op, in which is a complste set of Blacksmith's tools,
which 1 will also tent, and if agrgeabie 1 will hire to the I
tenant two negro blacki'miths, onc.of them is a complete j
workman.
If I rent out the Hons quarries, 1 wiil fell three crafts,
which were built for the purpose of carrying ftnsJe : they
will altogether bring upwards of 90 perch. Immediate
pofCeilion will be given. For terms apply to thefiibicrtb
er in this town.
ThcMitl, Brewery and Diflillety. with their appurten
ances, will be deliverÂ«d to the tenant or tenants 1:1 good
repair, and mull be so returned, at the df the

THE publisher t'ninlis it a mark of refpeftj due to a
liberal and'enljghtened public, to inform them that
this is the Poem for the publishing of which he hat been
twice dragged from his house, and is now laboring under
a vexatious 'prosecution. He is conscious that the piece
contains nothing either criminal or offenfive, unl?fs ori
ginal wit v decorated in elegant language, be criminal or
dlfgufting to the prevalent tafie ; and, as he trusts that
neither of these is the cafe, he submits the work to the
public with a full affuraijcc of its meeting with a favora
ble reception.
He would beg his prosecutors to call to mind (if they
have ever read it) the following apologue to a wÂ«ll known
romanreâ" A young painter, indulging a vein of plea
lantry, iketched a kind of Conversation Piece, refpeiting a*
bear, fin owl, a monkey, and an ass; and to render it
inoVe striking, humourous, and moral, dillinguifhed eve
ry figure by some emblem of human life. Bruin was
exhibited in the garb and attitude of a'n old, toothless,.
drunken soldier; the owl perched upon the handle of a
coffee-pot, with fpedtacles 011 his nose, feelned to contem
plate i newspaper ; and tha ass ornamented with a huge
tye-wig (which, howeyer, could not conceal his long
ears) fat for his piiluTe to the mojikey, who appeared '
with the implements of painting. This wL'mJuaigroup
afforded some mirth, and met with general approb..tiqu,
until iome mil'chievous wag hinted the whole was a lam
poon upon an old officer, a physician, and a member of
Parliament; an insinuation which w:s no feontr circulat
ed, than these people began to be ajarmed, and even to
fancy themselves fignified by the several figures in the
piece. The rurious 'group fell npon who de
clared Ifcat he had no design to jjive offence, or tp cha
raderizÂ® B T'.icular perfom. They affirmed, tic rcfcmllance
was too patp:iblc to tc overlookedâafcd their clamottrs bcin'T
overheard by the public, the Captain was a bear, the
Dodtor ill al's, and the Senator an owl, to their dying
day." If a Cmilar late ihould attend.the persons who
will infill upon being the members of this group, iic
public will do the pub'iflisr the to renumber that
; t is ho fault of his.

THE CONSPIRACY. %
O*OUET, RFTRESENTATIVE OF THE fEOPLE, TO
THE LEGISLATIVE BODY.
CITtTKNS, t'l
On the zi ft of FloreaV flioon^i
I was arretted in a house with five othiy .petfijWe,
who had niet by appointment to breakfTd. lam
ignorant of the motives which have induced the
Minister of the General Police to apprehend these
Citizens, whom I met for the sole purpose of con
futing on a letter which I had wiitten the evening
before, to the President of the Executive Directo
ry. The answer of this letter I had not then re
ceived, though I expc&ed it with impatience, that
â¢ I might determine upon the coarse which I ought
. to pursue. My intention was toconfult these citi
zens on what was most conventent, to be done for
the public tranquillity, and at the fame time For vin
dicating the honour of the National Representati
on, which I considered to have been violated in my
person, on the 19th of this month, at 11 at night
Otfght I to make a formal denunciation to the
Legislative i Ic-rt a copy of my letter and
my complaints in the i ;iblic papers ? Such wad the
question I piopofed to fuhmi tn Citizens Laignelot
and Ricords, whom 1 bad formerly known, and
with whom I had lived in habits of friendfliip be
fore hiy captivity in Aulria. We had i\ot met
above a quarter of an hoiir, when I had scarcely
finifhed the reading of my letter, when an armed
force surrounded the house, and arrelted Citizens
Laignelot, Ricords, Dai'e, and two others, whose
names I do not remember, as well as the proprie
tor of the house, whose name, I believe, is Du
four. The commander of the aimed force invited
me to follow him to the house of the MiniJter of
the General Police, from whence i was condu&ed
to the house of the said Commander, and after*
wards to the prison of the Abbaye, in which I
.was'(hut up without knowing the caufe v of my ap
prehension, though those who conduced me there
said it was a measure of general fafety. If the
public tranquillity demands my imprisonment, J
am fatisfied ; and 1 love my country too much to
complain of that which may be ufeful to it. It
matters not tome how 1 serve it, whether in shed
ding my blood in its defence, or in languishing in
whether in the field of honor, or as now
in the abode of infamy, provided that my country
be free and happyâl am contented. I (hall not
make the air resound with the accents of indigna
tion, nor the complaints which 1 might form against
the legality of my arrest, â the good and the evil
of this affair are too indifferent in my eyes to give
me either joy or sorrow. But bsfore I know the
eaufe of my imprisonmentâat tfie moment when
the public opinion is suspended Over me, I will ex
plain franklv rhe sentiments which have animated
me in all the events, iâ Â» which I have aÂ£tÂ«d a part.
Because no confiderat ion, nopoiveron earth is ca
pable of deterring me from openly declaring my
sentiments ; and bejeaufe the portion of the people
who named me for their R. prefestative, and who
probably know me well, have not said, 'hat under
these circumftamts I (houid ever diminiflq or aug
ment the enthusiasm for public liberty which they
seen me always earnedly profefs. This was
the reason of their choice, and foi which they ho
nored me with their confidence in 1791, 1792, and
again on the last renewal of the Legislative Body.
I hope that when my correfpondeiice, my papers,
my Speeches and my actions (hall be examined with "
attention and impartiality, the Legislative B"dy
will be convinced, that my whole life has been but
one continued pursuit of the mod pure philosophy,
and the mod ardent patriotism.âBut these words
do not fufficieatly ideaâfor there.are
also a philosophy and patriitifm peculiar to Lon
â¢ don, Vienna, Peterfburgh and Condantinople. The
difference anfes from the manner of Viewing things.
I (hall explain myfelf more clearly. From the age
of sixteen, the epoch at wlviqh i believe I began
to think, I have oiffeffed a heart inHamed with the
most sublime enthusiasm for the political liberty and n
equality of the body jocial. 1 had my mind stored a
with the principles of Rousseau, and Ray- c
nal. 1 learned to signalize my zeal, for which I t
wantfcd but an opportunityâlt may be seen if f
ever 1 have omitted any one. v
I (hall not attempt to retrace all the aflions 1 f
have performed in the (hort space of my political v
career, led I (hould seem desirous of calling to my (1
aid the gratitude of Republicans. Far from me f;
be such an idea ! If I have done fqme good, it has n
contributed to my own fatisfaftion and pleasure, b
and I require no thanks from any one. If, acci- t
dentally, I have commitied*fome evil, it has been n
always by ignorance and without design ; for, nei- o
ther vice nor ambition have innabited my heart, t
Far from me also be every ultra and intra revolu- fl
tionary idea ! I underdand nothing of those fludlu- n
ations. 1 know only the Republican principles, I
which guarantee to the people their rights and so- w
vereignty. This is what my condiments willed in 0
1792, and it is this which I have always willed, I
"because 1 have not had the insolence of fubdituting n
my will for theits. At the moment when I was b
made a prisoner of war, I had the happiaefs of n
feeing realized in my country those ideas which c
almod every author had treated as chimerical. I o
saw, at length, in a corner of the earth, an im- a
menfe, free, and fovercin people, giving tothemfelves
the iÂ»ws which they believed necessary for their ti
fafcty. I saw them also in the midst of this revo- r;
iutionary crisis, rending all tire efforts of their am- ri
bilious neighbours ; und (haking off, in despite of ci
their impotent rage, ali the prejudices ofprideanoi tl
fuperdition. This idea co.ifoled me jn my capti- (1
vity, I congratula cj myfelf on having contributed R
fometWwg towards tfee regeneration of my cotlntry ; I
Bnd 1 felt myfelf honoured in belonging to a.peo- j ol
pie whom I regarded as the molt energetic of the j A
universe. j pi
f , .
S. After this dev<jf>pemrnt of my .principles, it is
easy to imagine what mud have been my aftomin
ment when arriving on the fror.iifts of France, I
beheld the new order that was edablilhed in France.
'Â« Ah }" exclaimed L in the prefcnce of my col
leagues Qninette, Lamarc, and General Bournon
villt, " was it worth wlfilc to mike so tr any fa?ri
fices, and pour forth so much Wood for obtaining a
fydem wl>ich appears to me a Itriking resemblance
of the Government of the mod cruel and inverate
ro of our enemies. They have got an Upper Honle
and a Lower House, and they want only a Ring 10
render the likeness complete ! It is.to be Hoped that
, Eiurlaiid will soon have the.goodness to give us one
bfner own fort ; for at the period when I left
jj* France, the Royalilts and the intriguers had pro
-n posed to call the Duke of York to the overthrown
ie throne of the Bourbons."
fe Su h - were my sentiments on reading the present
j. Conditution for the firlt time at Fribourg. I be
g lieved my remaiks the more just, as I found that
). the Audrians praised this Conditution, and I have
> never been able to support the idea of finding my
it felf in unison with the enemies of my country.
it On arriving in France, however, I altered iu
i- some degree my language, because I found that
r the patriots had been the fird to accept this Con
-- ftitution, and that the Government appeared to use
i- every means to raise them from the (late of degra
y dation into which they had fallen after the 9th
t Thermidor. I arrived at Paris full of confidente
e in the good intentions of the Government. 1 pre 1
d fervejd for a long time this good opinion of the i)i
---e rectory, as may be seen by several letters 1 have <
t written too.ie of its members, in which I did my
i felf a real pleafute in pointing out to him those 1
â¢ things that appeared inimical to the public good,
t and for which I at different times received his j
f thinks. It grieves the friends of (heir country ;
I that the proceedings of the greater part of the a- -
s gents of the government do not accord with the <
; odenfible obje&s of the DiieÂ£}ory. In mod of '
â  the offices of administration then? are to be seen 1
- only pert coxcombs, who, when addressed, tum j
1 about on their heel, or (hrug ( up their (houlders, ,
f and never pronounce the honorable word Citizen j
1 but with a sneer. They behave in the most re- i
. pulfive manner to thofe,who bear Â»o other title than I
I their civic virtues or their glorious wounds.â '
- Throughout the whole extent of the Republic the j
; most energetic Republicans are never mentioned
: without some odioits Qualifications: if a man of 1
I the most pure intentions declares himfclf boldly in 1
j favor of liberty, he is immediately ranked in the 1
t class of monltersâand, by a revolting contrad, '
- while the apodles of the revolution are persecuted, 1
i those who have always been distinguished as itsene- 1
1 r mies, ,tbe Egotijls, the Aeitators, the Prieds, and â 
f even the Emigrants, enjoy a (hameful predileflion. ;
t Indeed, such observations as I had been led to make 1
- in various departments, were not calculated to left
I fen the anguish I felt in feeing the pronenefnof the 1
1 Government towardsJvoyalty, or, at least, to A- 1
: riftocracy. My heart was at the fame time pene- j
â  trated by sorrow and by Republican zeal; and, j
1 unable to oppose fuffirient efforts to tlie retrogade ,
â  motion of the revolution, I became desirous of giv- j
I ing in my refigation, and returning to the obfeurity 1
, from which. J wae drawn 1" iJCji , that 'I might '
- not remain an ina&ive fpeftator of the downfall of '
r public liberty. I (hould long ere now haVc er.e- v
â  cuted this design, not my health obliged me
> to drink the mineral waters. My fortune, ruined by %
- my captivity, did not permit me to. undertake a c
journey for this purpose at my own expence, and 1
until it (hould be completed I deferred my refigna c
1 tion. Let-my friends be interrogatedâ let th? let- c
ters which I have written to my wife, to different 1
I citizens, to the Minider of Finance, and to the
Executive Directorybe read ; they will prove, ,
, that 1 only delayed my departure until I received g
, "what was due to me by the government, and that 1
I should have been on my way more than eight r
days ago, inllead of being as now in prison. Not- '
withflanding, though I cannot judge bu. by ap
i pearances, lam accused of conspiracy.â1 a con- Â£
fpirator !âYes! Doubtlefi, I have sometimes con- 1,
fpircd, but it was againd the enemies of tlv Re- t
public; and it was openly with my sword in my 11
hand. 1 did not conceal myfelf at Varennes, at 0
Biefme, nor at Maubeuge. I have also conspired 0
secretly in favor of my health and my repose, which
1 was desirous of seeking in the bosom of my fÂ«-
mily ! Let all those who have seen or heard me, u
all who have read my letters, come forward to ac- '
cufe me, if Ido not declare the truth. I expedl 1
them witb all the tranquillity of an upright con- I
science. It cannot be believed, however, ?f;er I]
what 1 have fajd, that I pretend never to have p
spoken against the government. On the comrafy, v,
whenever 1 thought its operatiofttf were in any q
shape inimical to public 'happiness, I ,have never o
failed to censure them. I was not fatl?fied with ft
merely speaking, I have written also. There may tl
be seen among my manuscripts mar.y papers to at- el
ted the truth of what I fay ; and I feel myfelf ho- t!
nored by it, because I think that a representative n
of the people should be ever forvrard in defending o
the intereds, the glory and the liberty of his con- tl
ftituenti. I have announced that I (hall declare d
my sentiments. I mud fulfil my engagement, (ince H
m y' e lf exposed to the review of the- public tl
which is ever impatient to deteimineon the conduct p
of a citizen who occupies a confpictious fmiation. b
I have formed also some plans which probably will 1
not please all the wmld, and which will doubtless
be Wed by the greater nart of mankind as chi- fe
meric4l and absurd. It ,'iatters not, since 1 have T
conceived them, (ince 1 have fp,.ken of them, not in
only to my int.mate friends, but eves publish I m
am bound to letrace them here.
Weary of hearing the complaiotgof opp,e(Ted pa. T
tnoti, grieved to fee them reviled, reduced to mife- li.
ry, and despised by those who are gorged with the la
riches ot the Republic, I have endeavoured "to dif- m

'e have taken place for almost two years. 1 lie moil *

them with ]ealÂ«ufy, and have vowed to them impla
, Â£ahlc hatred, prepai e now to diipute the pi'-ze, and
would poflefs themselves of it exciulively. These hold
15 -in their hands tha means of" successâriches, leifuie,
y ambition; and above ail, thic flexibility of,'chaia&er
i- which is ib convenient to those who wiflj to Tupplant
ie others. The patriots, to re(ift these last attempts, can
,f only oppose the antiquated reputation of fonre virtues
now deluifed. There-r.etd th nbe uofarther ajlysifb*
' ment at the decline of the patriotic erithufialm which ].
r ' latelv elevated the' French people above all the natiotts ,
s > of Euiope. Still, however, the patriots exiit in great ,
n numbers. The remembrance < f their past glory, the (
e- (hame of being eclipsed by those who concealed them- *-
in selves during the revolution, the l know ledge bf the
_ evils which they have experienced, and the misery f
which has opprefled them, excite in thejr fouls the most f;
, lively indignation, and a itrfing desire of vengeance. L .
All the violent meafures,That the government may
" take, can serve only to retard for a time the bunt of
n confined paflions. In vaia does it prevent Ute afTem- 1
te blingof citizens. In vain does it hire the most cele
1, bratrd journalitls. It w ill not succeed in breaking e
] that band of Sentiment which unites all patriots from f
one end of the Republic to the other. The patriots
\ will meditate all their liverthe means of resuming the
influence which they have loft, and thousands will
'â¢ arise to avenge every zealous viflim who shall perish
:c in the ente: prise. I have long since made this caleula
-- tion, and have forefeen that torrents of blood were
lc again about to flow for thirty or forty years, that is
to fay, until the revolutionary generation fliould be '
extinct. This idea struck me with horror! and I con- .
J fidered if there were not some means of averting the 11
'Â» scourge from my country. I saw only two, one of
e which appeared to me impradtirable, viz. that the 0
r. government fn.iuld rally around it ail the patriots, and
y ltave the aristocrats and royalists to complain at their
t lcifure. Thefi- kind of men, who are neither nurae
,f energetic, are always ready to submit, though 1
with murmuring, Jo the laws that are accepted by the
majority wbenwhey find them rigidly enforced. The
e .#> ond mean will prpbably appear chimerical to all the
y world I corifider it, however, as the on:y one that
a can save the patriots from the humiliation of bending
d their heads under the yoke of their'enemies; or else 15
, the cruel neceflity of dipping their hands in the hlood
_ of their fellow-citizens, to avoid a tyrannical domir.a- ri
t tion. For it ought always to be remembeeed that, f<
though citizens may not alw ays be of one opinion, they -
e are still not the less brothers, the children of onecpm'-
, mon mother. Upon the recollediion of this title, ail
J good citizens will revolt at fhedduig the blood of
t Frenchmen. Such was the sentiment which animated ll
t me, when I formed in my mind the following plan
i When Ariflocracy shall have completely etfabliihrd
, l' er proud dominion, when there Aall remain no prof- Q
of fatisfaciion or happiness in France for those de
clared patuots who have accorapliihed the revolution,
â¢ let them rase as one man. They rnuft take with them
- tneir moveable pr.perty, their provisions, their inftru
r Â®', nts Â°* husbandry, and their arms, their wives and
t r U r e ?,' T hey ' nuA l ,roceed Awards the frontiers

tel.s them, burst as a d'efplaiing torrent on the fertile
regions occupied by the enefties of the mother coun
try. It is there they must eftablifo themselves as con
, querors Â«.d legiflaturs.
" tll . e ' c ' ,o " c that they can Itiily found the ,
t 1 nnity of Dertjpcraeyâ Equality, Liberty, and
- Fraternity. They mull bear before them the ho
r ly palladium of the Sovereignty of the People, and, r
; presenting witj, one hand the sacred code of reefon, L
, with the other a terrific fcymetar, force the van
quiflied to bow down before the divinity of the J"
r rr?' 3 ; Â» In r r ttin e their counti\-, let them m
i hake the dust of the foil from thejr feet, to shew
' that they will never re-enter it again. Let them
â  etlace every trace of the fetters which' enchained '
â  them in Trance, so that the name of Frenchmen
' m f 3 ? om that morn ent he etazed from the column
; ot Liberty, and the emigrants resume the name of
â¢ their most early anccftors. It is thus I wifii the r ,
â¢ defcendank ,of tliofe brave Gauls who (hook the to
! Koman Republic to its center, to hallen to avenee K
, the rights of a Sovereign people, violated in the Â£*

i CO'IVCIL OF FIVS HUNDRED, July J.
The secret committee, formed yesterday by the
| Council of Five Hundred, has not yet foimed any
result. It was resumed and continued to day. A
J message from the Directory was read, declaring,
that the anarchists agitate Paris anew ; that they
had resumed their criminal hopes, that a part of
the conspiracy of Babceuf had already been exe
cuted in the morning; that women, or men dif- :
gulfed as women, had rushed inio the markets, had I
there rated merchandizes at their pleasure, and had
carried them away, pillaging, or, at least, paying <
with mandats, to which'tbey gave what value they i
pleased ; that these disorders were the more alarm- <
ing, in that the seditious cloaked themselves with I
L the pretext of certain laws too imprudently adopt
ed, that it time to take efficacious measures 1
and to fybmit to a frefh examination certain tinan- e
cial laws which opinion reje&ed, and the execution 1
| of which, terrors the ereflion of fcr-ffoMs, and the 1
adoption of all the revolutionary measures could ]
i nut produce. t
The discussion was began less upon the disorders a
which had taken place in Paris, than upon that t
â =*' which was the true cause, that is to fay, the law
which ajfimilcitcs the mandat with money.
Cambaceres spoke with much force and talent,
upon the necessity of at lait abandoning systems, a
the iniqiiity of which was acknowledged ; which t
ruined individuals, under pretence of enriching the n
State; and which, in fa<ft, only enriched some d
â¢ luiavirs. He reminded them, that eonfidence could c
not be commanded ; that it was to be obtained only n
by a series of raeafurjs well concerted, and by a si
conduift and plan* proper to re-assure men of pro
' perty, too long facrificed to the eneiries of all or
der and prosperity ; that it was the business of go
vernment to remove all fufpirions, to merit the fuf.
1 frages of the good, and to {hew a loyalty which n
should serve as an example to all citizens. He de- v
clared it as his opinion, that the surest means to i!
Produce a better nfTSTo carry on 1,
a severe economy into all parts of the admish.tra- ti
tion ; to accelerate pease by an union of vigour C
& moderation ;to place know!edge'& probity in the e i
room of ignorance and plunder ; to give entire li- a ,
berty to private bargains and to commerce ; and tl
to put the receipts and expenditures upon a footing
the least fubjefl to the abuses and caprices of (lock- et
jobbers. J(
Cambaceres enlarged upon these ideas in a man. a l
ner which made a ftror.g iir f effiao upon the Coun- Â£
cil, and added'to the idea which had been longen
' tertained of his excelleet disposition and kis know
ledre. He was followed in the tribune by several tr
othe* orators, who spoke to the fame effed, and w
infilled on" the necessity cf replying those laws ra
which good men cpuld not approve, and which only
favored knaves, by enabling them to psy large
debts with little money, and to turn the national
fortune to their own profit. ce
All teemed to be fatisfied of the utility of a a'r
courfeof exchange for the Mandats, without, how ed
cvei, entirely repealing the law of the 28th Ven- ed
tofe upon the sale of national pofTrffions. Camus H
was almost the only one who seemed to think, that ar
if itu iirniSirn .f' Â«ku--obliged' to make .its pay
ments in course, the Mandat would be Sill more
discredited by the large emissions, and that the pub-, pr
lie treasury would not be able to anfwerall the ex- to
pence*. The discussion was to continue next day,
and llill in Jecret committee. nr
The alarms expressed yeftersay by the Dire&o- m;
ry naefiage upon the state of Paris, were but D
too well founded". A general pillage had been or
ganized by the Teirorifts, who hoped that the in
digent would fuffer themselves to be reduced by this
lure. The feimentation was great; the groups L
were heated- by Jacobin blood hounds and revolu- err
tionary figures.âThey were every where in the th
fields, runuing through the streets, seeking to bring R
over the military to them, by exaggerating their ar
hardships ; attiibuting the discredit of the man. ne;
dais to the : afluring the people that if thi
; Baboeuf and Drouet had triumphed, they would fit
Tiav<f* been on ti par with money, boasting of the an
reign of Robcfpierre, and declaring that they would mi
not he happy till there were neither rich men nor he;
i mer chants, nor Directory, and the patriots (a la I am
i Babauf) fhauld rule every where. In the evening en
I they were obliged to confine themselves to conver- enl
iaiiun ?.:id unavailing provocations, because mea
ires had been taken. But, in the morning they
f had nearly pillaged the markets, and thus exposed
Paris to/want fc frighteniug and robbing the country
people who were bringing in provisions. cej
I To-day, thanks to the police, calm is reestablish- of
ed ; and the Jacobins have not hid the fame, fuc- me
eefs as ytffterday, although they have endeavoured tw
â¢to renew the corwnotions. Some of the insurgent s ( | ti
have been arretted, and there have been found a
mong them fomeoftheald valets *>f the fa&ion of co]
Organs, and of the committees of Robespierre. cfi
These movements ought to prove to the direflory m ,
how perfidious or {hort- sighted are those who seek w j
to lull them asleep again, to prevent their feein'g
the plots which the anarchilts are constantly re
ntwir.g. It is now proved to them, that there is
fno fafrty in Paris, either for them or for men of w
property, until the National guard (hall be re-crea- â

twet,n the Lahn and Mein The whole force of

considerable force beyemd the Lahn, and as he re
ccived daijy reinforcements, it was determined to'[ ls
make this day the 16th, a geneial attack upon his ; pai
whole line. I V HI
But the French gen. Lefebre, who was proba
bly informed of this plan, attempted t6 fiullrate it
1 by attacking the corps of Genetal Werneck near ti^e
Wetzlaer, on the 15th, before several corps of Auf- b
reached their refpeftive positions
on the rSin. Altho' thc Anttrians fought with
their wonted bravery, and were immediately sup- pu
ported by a corps of Sixons ; the French gained uiii
at firft some ground, and it seemed to be their c' % n,!
