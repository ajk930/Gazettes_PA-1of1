so Lf i ter a Mag'ftrate of Bern ia the name of the
Council, to Monf. Barthelemy, in anjwer to hia
} letter to the Helvetic Cantons f.
m When, Sir, yout demand of being formally
ie acknowledged as Arobaflacjor of the French Re
ly public was laid before the Council of which 1 have
le the honor to be a member, I opposed it, because I
h did not fee any advantage whifh could arise from
ls that measure to the Helvetic Body, because, with
i. out having been acknowledged by lis under that
e title, you had nevertheless for several years ac\c(l
>t as the intermediate agent in the various connexion*
|. between France and Switzerland, and because I
â t confi<iÂ«red that demand as an atteippt to draw after
e it many others which might disturb our rights and
t our tranquillity.
r, Your letter of the 20th of May, which has this
1. moment been trasifmitted to us through the Hel
1, vetie Direfiory, juftifics my willru/l, and leave.
e us no longer any rrnf" m d~"<kl k,,> tint the
r I'lVrtllifi ICepublic have m truth an intention of o
verturning the bafisof natural law, and of the pub
s lie rights of nations.
How, Sir !âHofpitality is unquestionably one
. of the raoft sacred laws of Nature ; it wis theori.
. gin of civilization, it created {so tofpeat) all the
. social virtues, and yet the firft aft of your mifiien
, is to solicit us solemnly to infringe it. You not
. only demand from uÂ» th.t we !hou!d rejedt those
. unhappy fugitives whom your fuccelTes in Italy have
. driven from an asylum where they enjoyed the only
consolation of the unfortunate, the refpeit of the
. public ; but yon also press upon us abfoluteljr tÂ®
feanifh fÂ»om our territories, the unfortunate, whonÂ»
our religion direds us to comfort, whom refpeft
for oar laws, our customs and our manners, has
daily rendered more dear to/our fellow-citizen.,
who for seven years have by their conda& prefeat.
Ed to our countrymen examples of the ftri&eft
j fidelity, and in their misfortunes have afforde<| pat.
ferns of the noblest reCgnation. They are, yon
fay, the enemies of both nations. Without doubt
they figji over the vidtims of oppreflion, and over
the cruel destiny of their country, torn by the fu
ry of difcoidant factionsâAh! whereis the heart
so hard as lint to &cd tears over the evils which
France has endured for so many yearsâBut if they
have plans of haired and vengeance (which the
necessary weakness of their Gtuation will not per
mit us even to fufpeit) they take good care to
conceal them from us, and it is time at length to
render us justice, by bifeving that our aÂ£iive care
will not give thcra any opportunity of favoring in
our territory the hollile schemes of the power*
leagued against our government. No, Sir, they
are not cur enemiesâgratitude docs not produce
hatred : I will fay more, they ate not your'sâthey
companionate you, and fliould it happen that the
, r ' une Â°f wai Should favor their cai:fe, their fitft
wiih (to use their own enpreffion) would be to o
-1 pea their arms to repentance ; their cejt would beto fee those who differ frow them in fentimetit, in dir
the peaceable enjoyment of that asylum which you du
would ravish from them with so much inhumanity, ty'
Consult, Sir, your own memory, and you will not lor
doubt but those are the sentiments of the French (la
mobility who idolized their king, more attached
than ever to thor religious principle!, and whose
greatest misfortune is to hare survived all that was
dear to them. Consult your own-interest, ind per
haps you will think it imprudent any longer to urge on
a measure of which you yourfelf may by some un- to
forefeen event be the victim. vu
But I pass on to another object which is no less of
important, as it concerns the law of nations. Per- a ]
mit me. Sir, to a(k you, who is that writer that co
has furnifhed you with that maxim so unknown un- thi
til our days. " A neutral nation cannot grant an th<
asylum to the enemies of a belligerent state, with- lef
out " efTentially affe<ftiirp the duties of neotrality." ne
It was without doubt dictated by that unrelenting
hatred which projected your inftruftioi 6 ; for I can w;
never believe that a person so deeply versed in di- qu
plomalic knowledge could have thus confounded ne
the duties of alliance and of neutrality, things in to
themselves so materially different. The one (at lead an
with particular and stipulated exceptions) obliges th
us to regard as enemies all the fubjefts of the State If >
armed against the allied parties, and forbids grant
ing them an asylum under the penalty of essential- fid
Iy affecting the duties of alliance The other sub- I
jests us only to the prohibition of favoring the one m ]
of the belligerent powers. Neutrality, such as we to
exercifeand such as has beÂ«n defined by Puffendorf, m
Grotius. See. is the political fitaation of a govern- ca
ment, which, not furnifhing either directly or in- th
directly, either troops, arms or succors, offenfive . te
ordefenfive, to the belligerent powers, maintains
with them its treaties and union, and commerce,
without being affected by the rights of war, in its
interior or exterior operations.
It iB upon this basis that we have scrupulously re
gulated our conduct to this day, and if, by an impo
litic condescension, we should luffer ourselves at this tb
moment, to deviate from those principles, fanftion- c '
ed byrfie laws af-Mtiwns, irkat- imam it/ hme Â»'<,
that you will not immediately <jemand of us that we P
break our commercial connexions with the Enipire, P'
with Auftriaand England, and even that we should 'y
dismiss the miniftersof those dates? All those de- F
mands would be a confequenee of the fird, and we I
fhouid have loft the right of refufrng a compliance, ri
What right, what law (hould we then have to oppose P
to the aggrefiions of your enemies. Would it be ei
that of our neutrality ? Despoiled of all its cha- tl
j-afteriftics, it would not be acknowledged, and our P
only reconrfe would be in a coalition, and this the a l
political interests and the pacific views of our Can- Cl
tons equally reject. But, fir, who will warrant to t{
you that the powers leagued againÂ®; France will not
claim on your account the pretended tight which
you this day set up ? Let not your modesty deeeive
you, for if in our readiness to fatisfy you, they
(hall imagine they discover proofs of our weakness,
they will make your judgment on this occasion the
ffandard of their conduct, which will then proba
bly accord with their interest. S
I allow, if you please, that such is the lot of the si
emigrants and the unfortunate French priests, that o
kowever rif;t>rouÂ» tbÂ« wwaftiren mig*t be which we tl
ffcould lake against them, that still oo claim would vi
be made which would at all disturb our political q
tranquillity ; but doth the certainty of impunity I
change the nature of a criminal attion ? Shall we 11
commit an aft of barbarity because we have no n
caofe to fear that it will be avenged ? And what d
then will be ihis new morality of nations if fucb r
principles are to be eflablifhed in place of the rights b
of nature, of those of humanity, and of thefacred si
precepts of religion ? No, Sir, I dare allure you a
that we (hall do honor to ourselves in refpefting the ']
unfortunate, and the only courage we (hall want, b
will be the courage to expose ouifelves to the flings b
of rertiorfe. . a
1 know that they cannot this moment object to t
us the example of a sovereign, who connected to r
the house of Bourbon by the dearest ties ef blood r
has yet consented to theexpulfion of the emigrants f
from all his stateS ; but it will not be the mediators f
Â«f the pacification of Prufiia or of Spain, who will t
cite to me a treaty diftited byforee and fubferibed s
by weaknjfs ; a treaty whiÂ£h was the ahufc and not
the right of victory ; a treaty ilL&iie, which highly
eenfured by yourowil citizens, provokes an unfver
fal indignation against the conquerors, and weakens
a sentiment of the tenderefl interest in favor of the
vanquilhed.
And whither would you, that these unfortunate
grangers should go, if banished from theit country t
where they could find only a si affold, and driven
from the land where the terror of your arms gives 1
the Jaw foj; their profcriptioo, they are still repulsed
from neutral dates where their supplications de- (
mand less the right of existence than the tranquilli
ty of the tomb ? Shall we behold those tboufands
of old men, of women, and of children, who, with ,
the little of their misfortunes, have cast themselves |
upon our hospitable territory, shall we, without hor
ror, behold them hopeless of an adytum but in the .
Dens of Savages, and without any fubfiftepce but
that which they mult dispute for with beads of
the sorest ? Ah, do not doubt fir, you have known
them in the hour of prosperity : we do not doubt,
we who for seven years have observed them under j
the trials of adversity, we do not doubt but that
their lad sigh would be a prayer for their perfecu- ]
torsâBut, even their prayers would not disarm the .
hand of the Eternalâtheir bones scattered over
our foil would call for the vengeance of Heaven up
on us, and upon our posterity, and the tending cry
of our confsiences would be but the commencement
of our puuifhment. I am, See.

I have the honour to inform your lordlhip, that 1,01
e on'the 1 &th instant the French entered Bologna, to -
1. to the number of about 15,000 men, having pre
vioufiy sent before them a commissary and a troop
fs of cavalry, to demand entrance into the city, with
â¢- a promise of treating it in a friendly manner. In ffA]
tt confequenee, being mailers of the town and fortrefs,
I- they made the ganifon prisoners of war, and sent 1
n them under escort into the Milancfe. The Pope's Mr
l- legate, they immediately ordered to quit the Bolog- XÂ° ;
" nefc - '
g On receiving this information, I immediately "
n waited on the prime minister, Scratti, and the mar- | at{
i. quis Manfredni, to koow whether his royal high, be
d ness had any intelligence of an intent of the French rea
n to march into Tufcany, or to garrison Leghorn { -
ft and I had the most positive assurances from both,
:s that the French had no idea at present of entering ' (
:e into Leghorn.
t. I own, my Lord, that Ido not place much con- 0 r
1. fidence in their promises of not coming to Leghorn ; anc
j. I have therefore thought proper to write to the ad- obi
le miral my sentiments to that effect, requeding him
re to leave some vessels at Leghorn, to carry off the
f, merchants and British fubjefts, with their effects, in wa
1. cafe of a fuddeD invasion. 1 have likewise desired f a y
