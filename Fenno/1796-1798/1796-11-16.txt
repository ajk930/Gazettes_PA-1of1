' NOTWITHSTANDING the influence of the
â¢>> passions which raged with so much fury at the time
Mr. JefJerfon sent in his commercisl teport, and
the artful manner on which he and his partizanÂ»
J seized on those partizans to direst them to the fop
port of -their dangerous purposes, yet the enlight
ened difeiifTions which took place in Congress and
the public alarm which was naturally excited at the
impending danger united to defeat the views of the
Secretary : after a debate of several weeks, his
friends, being unable to carry more than one Soli
tary resolution, which Mr. Madison * himfelf con
'* fidered ss altogether irifigni/icarit, gave up the con-
tell in despair ; country efcaptd at the fame
time from the hotrots of war and M r > Jelterfon's
schemes.
Before we take leave of this famous report, the
theme of so much panegyric, it wii! be proper to re
capitulate, thatâalthough it contained only fifteen
. short pages, near three-fourtlÂ»s of which conlilled
of facts, taken from books of rates and commer
cial documents, and was the labor of almoll three '
yearsâyet it teemed with blunders; that whenever
it attempted to reason, its principles were fsjfe, in
confident or inapplicable to our Gtuation ; that the
means recommended were pernicious in tile extreme,
and the end prapofed dishonorable to the Unjted
States; and that the time, fclefted lor carrying it
into effcÂ£l, evinced a reliance more on the ptfii hj
and prejudices than on the judgment and patrittifm
of the legislature.
It will be proper also to ihew, in this place, '
that although Mr. Jefferfon recommended hojiile Â£
â¢ measures on the presumption that Great-Britain |
.wat not disposed to enter into a commercial treaty
1 witli the United States, yet that soon after he quit- v
ted the dffice of secretary of Hate, a ci*Â»imercial
treaty A-.as concluded with that country, on teims j
fimilar to those, which he had fuggellcd in bis re- c
port, as the ba/ts of such treaty. c
In page 14, he faysâ" Sueh being tile rediic- fl
tions on the commerce & navigation of the United
States, the queflion is, in what way they may bell
be renSoved, modified and counteracted ? As to
commerce, two methods occur, ift. By friendly
arrangements with the several nations with whom n
1 these reftrifiions exill ; or, 2d. By the ftparate S
aft of our own legislature for countervailing their
. efFefta. There can be uo doobt, hut that of these f'
. two, friendly arrangement is the mofi eligible." In
ip. 19, fce faysâ" Still it must be repeated that l '
1 friendly arrangements are preferable with all who <'
3 will come into them, and that we fheuld carry in
s to such arrangements all the liberality and spirit of "
accommodation, which the nature of tlÂ»e ease will I tl
admit.'' He then'immediately addsâ"France has,
, of her own accord, proposed negociations,'' &c. n
and immediately after, " Prop|fsls of friendly ar- c
rangement have been made, on our part, by the P
) present government to that of Great Britain ; but 0
beijig already on ts good a footing in law, and a f<
j better in fas, than the molt favored nation, they Â°
â¢ have not, as yet, dijeovered any difpofiiton to have P
it meddled with." It is evident then that he here P
proftlTes to prefer friendly arrangement on the most ti
liberal terms, and only recommends the other ifter- :, l
native, because Great-Britain had declined such b
friendly arrangement f. â  f(
; Mr. Jefferfon resigned in January, 1794, 8
( Mr. Jay was inÃrufted in the April following, to
revive with the British government the commercial c
j negociations, which the coolness of Mr. Jefferfon "
had interrupted. â ' c
Let us now take a view of the principal csufes of
complaint, which the report dated to ele'll against ,
j Great Britain, and fee whether Mr. Jay's treaty K
does not remove them.
j The report complainsâift. That our commerce "
and navigation were not secured by fixed laws 3
2dly. That thei'e was a want of re<iprocity in the 1
duties imposed ou the commercc and navigation of
the refpeftive countries. The treaty with Great. !â¢
Britain completely removes both these grievances ; â¢
for our commerce and navigation are now secured V
by treaty, a greater security than even sn aft of
parliament, and a perfect reciprocity is established "
( in refpeft to the duties ou the imports and shipping
of the two nations.
i He ofc.ervesâ" Tnat where the circumstances
of cither party renders it expedient to lay a reve- Z
nue by way ef impolt, on commerce, its freedom
might be modified, in that paiticular, by mutual r '
and equivalent measures, preserving it entire in all
others Some nations, not yet ripe for free com.- a
i merce, in all its extent, might be (till willing to v
mollify its reftriftions and regulations for us, in ''
, proportion to the advantages which an intercourse w
with us might offer: particularly, they may concur
with us in reciprocating the duties to be levied on each P
fide, or in compensating any cxcefs of duty, by ri
equivalent advantages of another nature." Now, &
the treaty is predicated altogether on these ve.y n
principles. Had Mr. Jefferfon, then, been disposed f :
â  to negociate with Mr. Hammond, tbere is no rea . n
son to doubt, that a treaty of commercc might
have been concluded between them, on the prin*i- *
pies which Mr. Jefferfon state* in his report, as the u
true basis of a con mercial treaty. ti

in To the EleÃors of the Preftdent of ths United States
Refpeflable Fellow-Citizens,
s " MERE verbal disputes have been often the
causes of the greatcft confufion, danger, and in.
jury. Verbal sophisms have frequently dishonored
S ' and injured the mofl interesting topics of bufiiiefo
e " r politic* and science, and are peculiarly dangerous on
[ conjlitutional fubjefts. It is thciefore of no fimU
importance to take some notice of the manner in
r " which the term " republic," is used, tli>eughout
" The Defence Â»f the American Corjlitution." What. '<
Â° ever may be the fcnfe in which a few book politi- ,
cians have occasionally used the word, in mere dif.
" cuffions upon paper, the public Jlyle of Great-Bri.' ?â 
tain, for example, has always been to call itfclf a
j" kingdom. A Brinfh minilter, who fhonld haÂ»cp Jt .
fented to the king a draught ot a proclamation,or
other official aft, terming that government "arc
' public." or, " a commonwealth," would certainly 1
be exposed to very fcrieus confluences. A mem.
ber of their legislature, who should move an addiefj
n .to the kmg,or a bill for confuleration, ityling Great-
Britain " a commonwealth," or, " a republic,"
would be very fortunate, particularly in thcle times,
if he efwtped with being called and compelled to or.
der. Some writers, who have used the word " re
public,'' fiitce the restoration of the second Charlei,
have been treated with the most acrimonious crit'i.
~cifm ; and the botiftf of commons,' even on the op.
position fide, has "been tbe public theatre of far
eafms and denunciations against "republics." The
members of the minority itfelf, have repelled the
. charge of " republicunifm," as a damning imputa.
tion. It is tlx appropriate n.ime for the most ex
( treme hoflility to the British conliitution. '
Mr. Adams perfectly well knows the fenfc ia
which tlrtr practical and theoretical politicians of A
mericit and at least the practical politicians of Eng- |
land underltood and ule the words Republican and
Republic. They all fonfider a Republic and.a
Monarchy as diametrically opposite. In England
a publiftted bookv pi'ovin jj Â«..[ and perluading to i '
a Republican form of government, would beconh
dered not only as highly offensive, but seriously pu
nishable. When our learned and enlightened conven
tion framed our Federal Conliitution, they certain
ly confi(fc'red an hereditary limited monarbhy, as
no republic. They meant representative and elect
ive government and not hereditary government. In
this intention truly, and in no other tty: people a.
dopted the Constitution. An oppofir: azfeniu* sjj
would have been fatal to the instrument, i'.felf. It
is finccrely and faithfully ia the representative and
elective fenfc, that the Federal Conliitution pro
mises, that it will guarantee to every state in the ' |
American Unien a jfr;publican form of government.
As no such aft of guarantee has been yet consider
ed oraccomplifhed, it is of confc<juen*;e to olfervei
that in the isthpageof the American edition and '
in the 2id of the London edit4.n in the piefate to
volume I, Mr. Adams expressly affirms tttar"Â« v a
limitad Monarchy, efpeciaHy-when limited by two
independent branches, an aritloeratical and a demo
cratical power in the cenAitutiou, may with JlriEt
propriety be called by that natpe," viz. " a Repub.
l'f will nearly follow. that ? f a> ' <
tempt should be made, in future, to convert the
several states into hereditary governments, with
kings and nobles, Mr- Adams would deem such a
meauire " properly and in truxh' 1 within
the meaning ot the terms of the Conftituupn. In
the 34th letter, be exemplifies this peneral asser
tion, too plainly to be m'ftincierftood, by an eviit- 15
ing favorite example, for he affirms that " the con. j
flitution of England is in truih a RtfufJic, asiil I.js I
ever fceen so considered by foreigners, and by the \
most learned and enlightened Ejigli Sitae 11, although
the word commonwealth has become unpopular and
odious, since the uirfuccefsful and injudicious at
tempts to abolish monarchv and ariftacracy between
the years j640 and 1660." (Sec page 208 Lon
don ) Confideiing how ingenious, bold
and tenacious the poflifJbrsof power often are, we
cannot but fee in thole two kindred and connected
assertions of Mr. Adams, an ample foundation for j
a serious, dangerous and fatal verba! fophim, by
which the high and strong barrier against hcredita- 1
ry power, contained in that paj t of the cwnlitti
tion, may be got over, without Uie trouble of
breaking it down.
This 34th letter merits very particular attention.
Mr. Adams begins by faying, he had promiferi to
state the ideas of Sir Thomas Smith concerning the
m utability of governments. Sir Thomas had pub- j
hfhed, in the remote reign'of queen Elizabeth, a
book, entitled, " the Commonwealth of England."
But after a few lines, which have not the, least rela
tion to the pron>ifed (tatement of the mutability of
governments, Mr. Adams difmifTc-Â» Smith's work,
with these words. " But as there is uOthicig re
" maikable, either in favor of our fyttem or a
gainst it, I should not hare quoted the book in
" this place, Lut for the fake of its title." And jaj
Mr. A then goes on to fay, " the- ecmrtiitition-of
England is in truth"* republic 1" Here we fee Mr. \
Adams purposely introduces in an aiTthor's meieti
tie page, tho' he mentions that his book, has no- j
thing in it of any consequence to his "_uefer.ee,"
(on purpose it mult be again said) tohave an o'ppor. 1
tunity of giving a good name, the name of reptit.
hVto his favorite govtrnmeftt. "Surely, Mr. Adr.irs
cannut expect the world to believe, that the Britilh
conftitu'ion is either like durs, because it was called
a commonwealth in the title page of an antique
book, written two hundred and twenty years be. M
fore ; or that it is in any degree the better, in fiib
ftance, bccaule that was then.gjven to it, or
that we ought to consider as immense dif- j
ference between our reprefentatite governments,
and that real and indifpntable compound of arifto-
craey in two thirds, and of monarchy in.one third,
uujnixcd with even a virtual representation of the
people. This fla'ement the Bntifli government
is forced upon us by every volume, bv the whole
fcupe, and spirit of Mr. Adams's work. It wai '-jH
wished to avoid the remarks here made, and those in i
the close of our last papet - , but it ilittipa'fible to do jg
justice to this deeply imerelting difcullion, wrthotil j
treating explicitly of that 'governsient, which Â»
erroocoufly held ug as the great exemplar for Am:-f/ / "
rica and mankindâat the mofl ftupendoui /abrtfc of
human inventionâas the politieal magnum bsnum ;
matured by time upon the tree of liberty.
What then arc truly the political functionaries
under the Britilh constitution. They are,
I. A king holding, hereditarily, the monarchi
cal third of the compound, we hare mentioned.
11. A house of lordly holding one of those thirds
of the compound, which we hare called ariftocra
tical.
111. A house of commons, at it is conflituti
onally denominated, which is completely indepen
dent of the people, in a clear and efficient majority,
and is truly an aristocracy of gentry, and of the
clients of the lords, holding its powers on thÂ»
foundation of landed estates, which dcfcend as he
reditarily to a liugle person, as the estates of the
lords, or as the crown irfelf. There are feme ot
cafiooal exceptions, when great and wealthy pur
chasers, (till clearly of the ariftocratical quality,
buy tu'ith coin the feejimpli of a decayed borough,
together with the appurtenant feat in the house of (
commons, or purchase, at the ele&ion-markets, s
the votes which are for sale. To such a number t
do this kind of members amount, that the largest J
house of commons which had ever assembled, before j a
the American war, was returned from places, the ii
majorities of whose whole number of electors were
no moie than five thousand feyen hundred and
twenty-three, in a kingdom with about eleven mil
lions and an half of inhabitants. If t:.e whole of a
the voters in those places (both the majority and
minority) were eleven thousand five hundred per
sons, they wpuld only be about the two-hundredth f|
part of the adult males. For a nation of eleven .
millions and fin half persons, contains about two
millions three hundred thousand males of lawful
age. After this review, which is believed to be
neither materially incorrect nor uncandid, we may \
fafely affirm, that the house of commons is a true m
and absolute aristocracy, principally of hereditary
wealth, and partly of pecuniary riches. The arjf
tccratic influence of many rich and powerful fami
lies, commands the feats fur foroe entire countiÂ®, I
-|'rams dirrdrs BThffrj. It refultstinanfweralil}', as we
' humbly conceive, that rhe British ihoufe cf com
mons are not the representatives of the people ;
that its powers are wielded by persons who have no
eleftivc relation to 199.200 th parts of the freemen
of Britain, but an interest as ariftocratical ami as * '
pppofite, as that of the lords. Is then "ihecon
ftitution of England," truly " a republic?' 7 Is it ( ' e
preferable to our's ? It that constitution, which is
f hereditary in two branches, and a flufiuating arif- 7 n
toctacy in the third, likeow's, which is teprefen- lm
taiive and elefivve thtoughout ? If it has preserved tw
liberty better than the dtfpotifm6 of the European l '"
continent, are we prepared to abandon for it our cul
federal constitution ? It is to us the most astonish
ing of all fadb, that becaofe the British and Ame
ricans have made three divisions of power, we
should be coafidered has having governments of To
three Â£>rders, like,*the king, the noble, and un
noblei aristocracies, which have obtained from the
unrepr.-rented people, the whole government of '
Britain. As well might we represent a pedestal, girt
retting upon three iron columns, as similar tq one nnd
supported by three non electric pillars. The whole exil
