SATURDAY EVENING, August 20.
A duel was fought a few days ago on the banks
, of ihÂ»- Schuylkillâthe partiea foreigners, one of
which was mangled in one of his arms. Three or
four (hots were fired by each. The cause we did
uot learn.
The floating bridges over the Schuylkill hare
been complained of; numerous are the accidents â¢
that occur on them in the course of every year : '
The week before last a carriage and horses wwe
precipitated into the water from the bridge over the
lower ferry at Gray's. The horses, a very fine ,
pair, were loft, and some of the company in the
carriage had a naVrow escape from drowning. The '
railing on these bridges, either from the form of '
their conftru&ian, or from carelessness, affords a
â very feeble prote&ion.
We hear that Genera) Charles Cotes-worth
Pinckne*, of South-Carolina, is to succeed Mr
Monroe, as Minister Plenipotentiary of
tiiteil States to the French Republic.
Mr. Pi n/:kne y is a gentleman of the firft abi- 1
lities, a firm Republican Patriot, and a decided &
unequivocal friend to the Conftitation and Govern
ment of HIS OWN COUNTRY.
Notwithstanding the superiority of the naval
power of Great-Britain, the French traverse the â¢
ocekn, and make immense captures. It is highly
probable that great part of one of the Jamaica
fleets, lately met with by an American veffei, ow
ing to the fmallnefs of the convoy, will be captur-
ed ; as a fnperior'force of the French went in pur- j
suit oÂ£ them, aiid were within five or fix hours fail. -

The bill fer affording some trifling relief to that
refpeftablt body of Christians, jhe Cfciakers, w >th
has, owing to the opposition of the archbishop of G
Canterbury, and the bifliop >of Rochester, been G
thrown out by the House of Lords. The latter
(Dr. Horflcy) confeffed that he had no idea of the q
fcrupoldUs conscience of a Quaker. His Lordship â
lpoke currefYy. He doubtless judged of other â
. people's confcic rices by his own.âQue re,âDoes â
his Lordship understand even the meaning of the
Word ?. Prudence, however, one might have hop- _
ed, would have suggested to our prelates, uot to
be so very ftiff on the fubjeft of tythe oppressions H
But the testimony of all ages unhappily proves,
ttyit. churchmen are the last to learn wisdom, and A
to prevent even their own ruin by timely reform.
The Jacobin fattion at Paris have happily been H
defeated, in their attempt to overthrow the gÂ°- "
vernment by infurrettion. Although the men who H
now rule in France, loverturned the couftitutional
governed by the fame accutfed means on the 10th
of Augttft, 1792, yet we hope such means will In
never be again attended with success, against any â
conftitu*ion, whi h, whatever may be its form or ~~
defects, like the republican constitution of France, "

Norwich Theatre exhibited, last Saturday, a L *
scene of confufion, loyalty and bloody nrfes, oc
casioned by the officers of the diffetent regiments ~
there, infixing on the audience hearing the song of _
"God save the King," with hats off. The com- Le,
marid did not suit the disposition of the people, and L 'l
a general fcuffle took place, which terminated in
touting the officers, who fled to their barracks and
quarters for protedlion. Several of them loft their
swords and hats. It is to the credit of two or M,

GLASGOW, June 9. f e
Yesterday morning arrived in tnc Clyde, the 01
Dutch fngate the Jason, of 36 guns and ao. men, to
r-: ,V onckum ' commander. Thi* veffei. th
whish failed tram the Texel on the 23d of Februa- Pi
17 loft, was, as appears from the depolition of the' w;
Captain now before us, one of a fleet of 17 f a || th
four or five of which were of the line, and twelve m
of which wrre bound to the East-Indies, under ihe -
command of Rear Admiral Lucas ; the rema.nder of
to Surinam, under the command of Admiral Braak. A
On the Bth ot March, between the iflandsof Shet- hit
land and Ferro, Capt. Donckhum met with a gale er
ft wind, which (htfted hi, ballast, separated him -
from the reft âf the fleet, and obliged him ,0 bea, P<
away for Dronhtheim, whete he arrived about th al
2Â°th of the fame mouth. After refitting a- Dron mi
theim, Capt, Donckhum, on the 20th of May he
am* prosecuted his" voyage toward, Surm.nn, without
*ny remarkable occurrences until the 31ft ot that
month, when, 50 leagues to the weft ward of Broad

after taking out of her fouie rum and (lures. Capt.

5Â° HAGUE, May 26.
State of the army of Holland. 1
The national army of Holland consists of seven *
hqlf brigades of infantfy, organized on the new i
plan. Every half brigade contains a battalion of t
light-horse, a battalion of artillery, and a regiment t
of cavalry, which are all in good condition. The 1
light-horse especially form a molt beautiful corps, t
14 They intend yet to raise a half brigade of infantry, (
25,000 French soldiers form the principal of their 1
foreign troops. 3
The Republic has, besides, five battalions of t
J0 Waldeckers, and two of Saxe-Gotha, in pay. They a
67 are about to re-organize them in brigades, and are
54 now in negociation with the Princes of Waldeck
4Â° and Saxe-Gotha.
There are, besides, in Holland, three disbanded
battalions of Swiss, but who will be retained on c
the pressing solicitation of the Dutch minister, ci- h
tizen de Witt, in Switzerland. f
14 All jhefe united troops, national and foreign,
** make a force of 49,000 men. t
The fixed maintenance of the twenty.five thou- a
35 sand French soldiers in the campaign, amounts to o
in twelve millions of florins per annum ; they are en
-14 tirety at the disposition of the Republic, and their if
chiefs are under the supreme command of the *1
jo Dutch National Contention. Their plan is to k
augment the army from time to time by nev* bri- f<
gades. d
â¢33 In the mean time, the plan of arming the citi- b
â¢ 5 Â° sens as National Guards has pafled ; they are to
' 2S the number of 62,000, the sixth pari of which n
*7 en g Ã g e t0 serve, in cafe of neceflity, in campaign (
or in garrison. p
The greatest difficulty in this disposition was to tl
determine, whether the ci-devant companies of
Orange, who were accustomed to place themselves h
66 annually before the palace of the Stadtholder, ft
66 should be comprised in this organization ; after I
some opoofition, it was agreed that they should be 1
of the number. o
63 The maritime force of the Republic will eonfift b
of 22 veflels of the line, 31 frigates, and 16 cut
-67 ter*. To call forth a desire for the sea service, they tl
have established certain premiums for the encou- 6
ragement of seamen. Â«
ROME, May 18. tl
i* On Friday last the banker Bottoni receired an
Clmrtt Crnm Tl*- (-
verse, who sent him a letter from the commiflioner ft
Salicetti, wherein the latter declares, that the ri
33 French are determined to enter the Papal domi- it
nions, and that they will allow the Pope but 20 tl
days to treat with the Republic. (In order to un
derftand this, it is necellary to know, that this
54 Bottoni was commiflioned about a year and an half d;
20 ago by the Pope, whose only confidence he pof- A
So feffes, to negociate with the minister Villard.) T
57 Bottoni immediately communicated these important n<
60 i |fp tches to the Duke Brafchi, nephew of his Ife
37 Hoiinefs. It was not difficult to make the Dnke pr
6z 'eÂ» the necessity of immediately commencing ane
3j gociation, for he is a feniible man ; but this was an
not the cafe with the Holy Father. The Duke M
;o introduced Bottoni into his uncle's presence, and m
}0 it was with difficulty he made him perceive the m;
great danger wherewith the holy fee was threau.r- ye
P l- ThePo PPscf Wh Â°f e refolutlon Â« aie always the

to give powers to Bottoni to treat with the General it

EXPEDITION AGAINST LEGHORN.
I 1 lie march of the French troops against Leg-
I horn, to taka pofleflion of the Englifii prqpf.rty
I deposited there, was fixed for the 14th of May.
The body of men destined for that service amoun-
I ted to hve or fix thousand, under the command ps
I Gen. Maffena. This officer has the ftriftett orJer*
j to conduit himfelf with the greatest moderation in
I the 1 ufcan teriitory, to refpeft property, to pay
in ready money for all that his folsiers may nfe,
j and to spare every thins; but the Eng'ifh wealth de.
J posited at Leghorn. "I'hc French this appa<violation of. a neutral territory, as a just rcpri
'i vi }or the seizure of a French vessel by the Englilh
in the harbour of .Leghorn; without any refiffance
* cm the part ot the Tuscan government, and for
the partiality with which the grand Duke has per
mitted ;he English merchants to make Leghorn the
great depot for their Mediterranean trade.âWhat
ever may be the justice or suspicions of these com
plaints, the French will probably be fuccefsfulin
their plan for giving a dangerous wound to the Bri
ti(h Mediterranean commerce, as there is no force
. its Ttifcany which can make any (how of refillance.
They flatter themselves in Italy, that the territo
ries of the Pope will be regarded as neutral. Let
â  ters from Verncs, however, announce that several
French privateers have appeared in the Adriatic,
which captute the Roman and Neapolitan vessels.
This leaves not a doubt of the intentions of the re
public, with refpeft to the Pope. Moreover the
iate Proclamation of Gen. Buonaparte to his army,
clearly announces thedefign to enter Rome, and to
operate there a change of system.
Extract of the Proclamation of the Commissioner
Salicetti and General Buonaparte, published at
Milan; 30' h Floreal 4th year.
The army is about to pursue its vi&ories, and
drive entirely out of Italy the despot who holds
Lombardy in chains. The independence and hap
pinefg of this country are connected with the fuc
cefles of the French. Lombardy ought then to
direst every effort towards this delirable object.
To feeure the march of the troops, we demand of
you provisions, which the army cannot receivefrom
France on account of its great distance from the
frontiers. It ought, therefore to find fupp'ties in
Lombardy, into which vi&ory has conduced it.
The rights of vrar ean -command us, and friendfhip
ihould hasten to offer us fucconr^,
This has determined us to impose a contribution
of 23,000,000 of iivres on the different provinces
of Lombardy. The wants of the army demand
it. The periods of payment, which ought to be
as soon as possible, (hall be fixed by particular in
ftru&ions. It is an easy contribution for so fertile
a country, above all, when the advantages which
may result from it are weighed.
The distribution of the fufh to be raised might
certainly have been made by the agents- of the
French Republic, and nothing would have been
more lawful; but they have confided it to the local
authorities and to the junto of state, pointing out
to them only its basis.âThis contribution ought
be divided among the provinces, in the proportion
in which the impost, that Lombardy paid to the
tyrant of Austria, was levied. It ought to fall sole
ly on the rich, on peifonsin easy circumstances, on
the ecclefiaflical bodied, who have been too long
priviledged, and wf)o have hitherto had the address
to free themselves from imposition. In general,
the indigenf'eMs mud be spared as much as poffi
b,e -
If reqnifitioris of property are made, the general
in chief, and commissioner of the government de
clare, thai there Thall be no fur-charge of contribu
tion. They (hall eftimatc hereafter the value of all
the obje&sin requisition, and they (hall be paid for
to the vender out of the produce of the war .contri-.
bation above fixecj. '

LEYDEN, Mny 28.
From Arofterdam we learn, that in consequence
of the notification made by General Bournonville
to rhe Municipality, relative to the fending a gar
rison into Amfterdam,the Council of that city sent
> deputation to him, to requefl that he would not
impose upon them the neceflity of receivings gar
rison. But the General replied, by letter to the
Council, that the arrangement in question was the
indisputable effedt of a military plan, according to
which a line was to be formed from the Helder to
Dollaert, and that this would require the placing of
s garrison of 12 or 1400 men in Amsterdam.
ITALY, May 24.
General Buonaparte has Ordered an army of
25,000 men to penetrate into the Ecclefiaflical
State. Deputies from the Pope have, however,
already entered into a negociition for an armistice.
1 he proposals of the French General are the fame
kind with those which she Duke of Parma has
been compelled to accept. Buonaparte requires,
besides the Apollo of Belvidere, the Laocoon, and
â¢bther valuable statues, fifty pidlsres, at his own .
choice, and a contribution of fifty millions of liv
res, either ia ready money or silver plate. The lat
ter condition, it is expefled, will be moderated by
the mediation of the Spanish Ambassador at
'Rome, to a fmallerfum.
MILAN, May 18.
The inhabitants of this city aflembled on the
square in front oftfieCatliedral,tohear the patriotic
speeches of several orators. The Music of Milan
played the cherished tunes ps liberty ; Ca Ira, the
Marfeilloife and the Carmagnole. The people af
terwards fwoie to live free or die ; hatred to royal
ty. &c.
I was this'morning in the popular society. Dif
conrfes breathing a great deal of patriotism were
pronounced here ; they denounced a libel, which'
was said to have been published bj; the monks and
the r.obles with a view to deceive the people. In
another society rhey said that the arch cluke who
had thought fit to run away had feiit word that the
Emperor had made peace with the French, and
that he would soon return to brjng all those to re>a
fon who had dreamed of declaring themselves a free
people. All this does not discourage the patriots
of Milan ; on the contrary, it renders them fliU
- more vigilant. I feÂ«l inclined to hope, that they
will fyccced in their generous undertaking, and
that jhe satellites of despots will do best to make
a journey to Germany.
I (hall fend yotl, by thb next poff, the speech of
the' president of the society, and also a patriotic
{long which was handed to me.
The citadel has not surrendered yet ; but I be
lieve it wflP soon be* besieged and easily taken.
LONDON, June 14-
The pope, it is said, has quitted Rome. He
has taken the route Â©f Naples.
An 'ipulent farmer, tenant of a Noble Lord
*bo rented nearly a thousand a year of the eilate
of the latter in SnfTcX, previous to the falling in of
a ie&fe of a frrialler farm adjoining his oWh, of the J
rent of eighty pounds, lately applied for the lease
of it, offering one hundred and thirty pounds, a
The terms were accepted, and he had the farm.
Soon after the original poffetTor applied for a re
newal, and had the fortification to hear it was dis
posed of: in vain be pleaded that his family had I
been in-pofTeflicn for nearly a. ccntury, and that c
the rents had been regularly paidâthe new lease r
was signed, and could not be cancelled ; however, t
hisLordlhip told the man to call in a few days, and 1
he would think of other means of accommodating a
him, this he did, and was then informed, that, as t
I fomfe kind of recompence for his having loft his p
small farm, if he so chofc, he might have the lease 1
of the larger one, which was in the pqffemon of 1
the man who had taken the smaller oneâthe lease a
of which was nearly expired, The offer appeared !
of a magnitnde which at firft daggered the appli- a
cant, until he was farther told, that, with whate- 1
ver money he might be in want of, as neeeffary to t
so extenlive an undertaking, he (hotild be accom- t
r modated. The bargain was on these terms acced- .1
t ed to ; no doubt with gratitude on the part of the
tenant, and wot less heart-felt Satisfaction on that <
J of the noble landlord, who had thus an opportuni- 1
sty the next day, of informing the avaricious spe
culator, in turn, that the lease of his farm was also 1
. disposed of, and to the very man he had been so <
) adtive to deprive' of the means of procuring an ho- 1
nest subsistence. % â¢

- been in prison eleven years, was brought up, and
e in confeqnence of the sign manual produced in

don, was discharged upon his own recognizance.
t A singular instance of the hardness of the times
e occurred a very few days sinceâ
n Fourpriefts of the order of Black Friars, took
il the following medicine, as an emetic and antidote
t to apoplexies, so frequent at this period :â
0 Two boiled fowls, with proper sauce ;
n Two roasted ducks, with green peas ; .
e Eight pounds of fre(h salmon, with a fufficient
quantity of lobiterand (hrimp fauqc :
n And four legs of lamb, with cauliflowers, &c.
Â£ After swallowing the whole dose, which operat
s ed violently, and working it off with copious li-
I, batifens of warm punch, they retired, much indif
i- posed ; but we are happy to hear, that they are
all perfedtly restored to health ; and have recom
il mended, in the most feeling words to their poor,
not to try the like powerful medicine, but content
1- themselves with the usual emetics, and work off

The/pirit of liberty makes daily rapid p'Ogrefs.â
The republican fetes continue to draw the people
of Lombardy from their torpor, and to excite po
e pular enthusiasm. On all fides we hear Austrian
e defpofitifm spoken againft,.and vows never to re
turn to it. The nobles, the priests, and the wo
it men are ever occupied in preparing means for the
it establishment of liberty, but the popular societies
- contribute the most efficacioufly to stir up thepeo
e pie to defend their rights, and to overturn royal
ie and ariftociatical despotism. The republican spirit
o is not confined to the capital, it spreads peaceably
o through the reft of Milan and Lombardy, Pavia,

NEGOCIATION ivhb the POPE.
It now appears that the intended march of the
i French troops to Leghorn, was set alide, solely in
t consequence of an alteration of circnmftances, that
e rendered this naeafure unneceitary, which was, that
, the offers of hisholinefsto negotiate, being (tronjr
d ly backed hy the Court of Spain, had been finally
; agreed to. Gen. Buonaparte, it seems, previous â¢<*,
s to this, had ordered a column of 25,000 men to
s proceed to Rome. The terms proposed by the
i French General are, that hi# holin'ols (hall deliver qj
f ujj_the Apollo of Belvidere, the Laocoon groupe, J3l
e and fevpral other magnificent statues, with 50 paint- jCa
j Ings to be fele&ed by the French, besides paying
- a Contribution ofso millions of French livres in rea
dy money, or plate. This lad condition it was -j-,
o thought would be mitigated by the mediatiori of g C
1- the Spanish ambassador at Rome. In the mean f-o
