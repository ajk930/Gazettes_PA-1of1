Particulars of the lots of the Britilh frigate
La Tribune.
HALIFAX, NOV. 30.
The melancholy fate of his Majesty's (liip
La Tribune, having'for the pad' week oc
cupied the attention of every feeling mind,
we conceived it our duty to colleft 1:3 far as
poflible, ail the circumllances which attend
ed the fatal difaller \ not only for the fatis
fattion of the public in gene,'! but particu
] larly for the information of the friends
of the unfortunate fuffercri, and of
the fortunate furtivors It is a tale re
plete with woe, aÂ»o the description given by
th'ofe who have fnrvivcd the difalter, of tl)e
horj-ors ofthe elofiug fccne, and the dismal
nigkt that followed, could we dojufticein
this rtiort narrative to their description,
would harrow up the feelings of the most
callous heart.
La Tribune was one of the fineft frigates
in his majefly's ferviee, mounted 44 guns,
and was lately captured by captain -Wil
liams in the Unicorn frigate. She was
commanded by captain S. Barker, and failed
from Torbay the 2jd Sept. as convoy to
1 the Quebec and Newfoundland fleetsâln
lat. 49, 14, long. 17, 29, flie fell in with and
. spoke his majesty's ftiip Experiment, from
( this place out 12 days. ShÂ« loft fight of
; all her convoy Oft. 19, in lat. 46, 16, long.
! 32, i,i. On Thursday morning Uft they
' discovered this harbour about 8 o'clock, and
the wind being E. S. E. they approached
it very faft, when Barker proposed to
the maftpr, to by the (hip too till they could
obtain a pilot ; the matter replied, "he had
beat a 44 gun ship into the harbour ; that
he had been frequently here and there was
ao occasion for a pilot as the wind was fair."
Confiding in these assurances, capt. Barker
went below, and was for some time employ
ed in arranging some papers he wilhed to
take on (hore with him. The master in the
mean time taking upon hirrt the pilotage of
the fhrp, and placing great dependence on
the judgment of a negro man by the name
of John Cafey, (who had formerly belong
ed here) whom he had placed forward to
con the ship. About 12 o'clock th: ship
had approached so near to the Thrum Cap
fhoalr, that the mafter,became alarmed, and
sent for Mr. Galvin the maftcr's mate, who
was sick below. On his coming oil deck
he heard the man in the chains sing out
" by tke wiark fire," the blackman forward
at the fame time singing out " steady."
Galvin got one of the earronades to observe
the situation of the ship, the master in much
agitation at the fame time taking the wheel
from- the man who was steering with an in
tent to vere the ship. But before this could
be effefted or Galvin give aA opinion flie
(truck. Capt. Barker instantly eame on
deck and reproached the master with hav,
ing loft the ship, feeing Galvin also on deck,
he addressed him (as he knew he
had formerly failed out of this harbour) that
he was much surprised he could stand by
and fee the lAifter run the ship on fhorc.â
Galvin informed the coptara hckvd not been
on deck long enough to give an Opinion.
Signals of distress were immediately made
and anfwercd by the military posts, and
(hips in the harbour. Boats from all the
military posts, from his majesty's (hips and
the dock-yard, proceeded to the relief of
La Tribune ; the military boats and one
of the boats from the dock-yard, with Mr.
Rackura, boatswain of the ordinary, reach
ed the (hip, but the other boats .though
making the greatest exertions, were not a
ble, the wind being so much Rgainft them,
to get on board. The ship wis immediate
ly lightened by throwing all her guns, ex
cept one retained forfignals overboard, and
every other heavy article, so that about half
past eight o'clock in the evening the (hip
began to heave, and at 9 she got off from
the shoals. She had before at about 5 or
6 o'clock loft her rudder, and on examina
tion it was fbund, that she had seven feet
water in her hold. The chain pumps were
immediately manned, and such exertions
made, that they seemed to gain on the leaks,
and by advice of Mr. Rackum, the captain
ordered to let go the best bower anchor;
this wasdone, butit did not bring herupf the
captain then ordered them to cut the ca
ble, aid the jibb and fore top naft flay fail
were hoisted to ftcer by. All this time the
violent gale which had come on from the
S. E kept incrcafing and carrying them to
the weftein shore ; in a short time thefmall
bower inchor was let go, at which time
they found themselves in about 13 fathon
water. The mizen mail was then cut away ;
it was now about 10 o'clock, the water
gaining faft on the ship, little hopes remain
ed of saving the (hip, or their lives ; at this
critical period Lt, Campbell quitted the
ship ; Lt. North was taken into the boat
out of one of the ports ; Lt. James of the
royal Nova-Scotia regiment not being to be
found, was so unfortunate as to remain, and
to the great distress of his worthy parents
and friends shared the general fate. From
the period when Lt. CSmphell quitted the,
ship, all hopes of fafety had vanquished, the
ship was finking faft, the storm was increas
ing with redoubled violence}.the rooky shore
to which they were approachingTefounding
with the tremendous noise of the billows,
which rolled towards it, presented nothing
to'thofe who expetted to survive the finking
of the ship, but the expe&ation of a more
painful death, from being dashed rigainft
those tremendous precipices which even in
the calmest day, it is almost impoflible to
ascend.
Dunlap, one of the survivors informs us,
that about lialf past ten, as nearly as he
could caiijcdture, one of the men who had
been below, came to him on the forecaftle,
and told him the ship was finkingâin a few
minutes after, the ship took a lurch, fit a
boat will when nearly filled with water, and
going down ; immediately on which, Dun
lap began to ascend the fore (hrouds, and at
the fane moment, calling his eyes towards
the quarter deck, saw captain Barker stand
ingtiy the gangway and looking into the wa-|
ter, and direftiy after heard him call for the |
jolly '.rjat.âAt thefame time saw the lleut.
of Marines running towards the taifrail, he
supposed te look for the jolly boat, as she
had been previously let down with four men
in herâbut instantly the ship took a second
lurch, and funk to thebottoin ; after which
neither the captain or any other of the offi
cers were seen. The scene, fufficientl'y dis
tressing before, became now pecularly aw
,ful? more than 240 men, besides fevcral wo
! naen and children, were floating on the
i waves, making their last efforts to preserve
exifteuce. Dunlap whom we have before
mentioned, gained the fore top âMr. Gal
vin the waiter's after incredible diffi
culty got into the'aula he,was below
when the fliip funk, 'directing the men at
tht chain pump, he was washed up the
hatchway, thrown into the waist, anJ from
tbencc into the water, and his ffcet as he
plunged (truck a rockâon he
swam to gain the main shrOuds, when, he
was f iddenly fei>.ed hold of by three menâ
he was now afraid he was loftâto dfrengage
himfelf from them, he made a dive into the
water, which induced them to quit their
holdâor riling again lit swam to the shrouds
and arrived at the main top, and seated him
felf on an arm chelt which was lathed to the
mast. From the observations of Mr. GaJ
vin from the ipain top, and of Dunlap in
the fore top, it appears that Dear a hundred
perfotis were for a confiderablf time hanging
to the shrouds, the tops, and other parts of
the wreck ; but from she extreme length of
the night and the levcrity of the storm, na
ture became exhausted, and they kept at all
periods of the night dropping off, and dis
appearing. The cries and groans of the un
happy fufferers, from the bruises many of
them had received, 'and as their hopes of de
liverance began to fai} them, were continu
ed through the night, though as the morn
ing appeared. jrom the few that then surviv
ed, it became feeble indeed ! the whole
number fsved from the wreck amounting to
eight jpcrfons, and fevcral of them so ex
hausted as to be indifferent whether they
were taken off or not.
Mr. Galvin mentions, that about twelve
o'clock, the mainmast Jgave way, at that
time he supposes there were ou the maintop
and on the shrouds upwards of 40 persons.
By the fall of the mall the whole were again
plutrged into the water, and of that number
only nine, besides himfelf regained the top.
The top re fled upon the main yard, and
the whole refined faft to the ship by some
of the rigging!"Ofrfthe ten persons which
regained the main top four only were alive
the morning appeared; ten were at
that time alive on the fore top but three *f
them had got so exhausted, and had become
so unable to help themselves, that before a
ny relief came they were finally washed away
three others perished, and four only were fi
nally in the fore top. ' The place
where the ship went down, was only about
three times her length to the southward of
the entrance into' Herring Core. The
pie eanie down jn the night to p<?int op
posite to where the fhip'funk, and kept Urge
fires, and were To near as to converse with
the people on the wreck. The firit exerti
on which was made for their relief, was by
a boy of thirteen years old from Herring
Cove, who ventured off in a fmall.flqff by
himfelf, about 11 o'clock the next day, and
this truly deferring young lad, with great
exertions, and at extreme risk to himfelf,
ventured to approach the wreck, and back
ed in his little boat so near to the fore top
as to take off two of the men, for the boat
could not with fafety hold arvy more; and
here a trait of gelMfHCtus-toagnanimity Occurr
ed, which deserves to be noticed. Dunlap
and Munroe, had throughout this difaftrOui
night, providentially preferred their strength
and spirits beyond their unfortunate com
panions; and tbey had endeavoured to cheer
and encourage them as they found their spi
rits finking ; they were now both able to
have stepped into the boat and put air end
to their own fufferings ; but-their other two
companions though alive, Were unable to
help themselves; they lay exhausted on the -
top ; wilhed not to be disturbed, and seem
ed defiroas toperiffi'as they lay. Thofc gen
erous fellows hefitited not a moment to re
main themselves on the Wreck, and to save,
though against their will, their unfortunate
companions j they lifted them up, and by
the greatest exertions got them into tb* lit
tle fkiff, and the manly boy rowed them
triumphantly to the Cove, and i:iftantly had
them conveyed to a comfortable habitation.
After shaming by his exatnple older persons
who had larger boats, he put off again in
his fkiff, but with all his efforts, he could
not again approach the wreck. His exam
ple however, was soon followed, by the men
in the Tribune'^jolly boat, and by some of
the boats of the Cove, and by theif joint ex-,
ertions the eight men were preferred, who,
with the four that escaped in the jolly boat
make the whole number of the solitary fur
rivors of this fine ship's company. *
Some have been disposed to blame capt.
Barker, as exhibiting too much obstinacy
in not abandoning the (hip and. preferring
his crew, as a violent iiorm was evidently
approaching; but on examing men who
have survived, we find, (though other offi
cers in the fattfe situation might hare form
ed a different ju,dgwenf) that the conduit of
capt. Barker ivas throughout...the trying
scene completely cool and collefted-âthough
from the ihanner in wbifh the (hip had been
run ashore, no blame could attach to him,
yet he could "ntSt reconcile it to himfelf te
lose so fine a fbip, without making every ex
ertion to save her. Having by the greatest
efforts, considerably lightened her, he had
reason to suppose (he might get pff before
high water ; she made no water while she
lay aground, there wastberefore great hopes
if she could not that Hight have been got up
the harbour, that she might with fafety been
brought to anchor and have rode out the
gale. Wheft ffcfa fuialJy got off, universal
joy jvas diffuied ttaovghout the ship ; eve
ry man thought that the objeft of their joint
efforts was attained ; but the rapid manner
in which the watef poured into her, soon
damped'their joy, and plunged them fnto
despair. Had the ship been finally favrd by
the great exertions which were made to ef
fect it, every man would have praised capt.
Barker; and notwhhftanding those exerti
ons failed, we think we may justly fay in the
language of Mr. Add'fcm
" ' 1 is not in mortal' to command fuccefÂ»,
" Barker did cnore ; hedlddeferve it." * j
To his memory therefore, and that of his
brave fellow fafferers, the commiseration of
their countrymen is justly dueâFrom eve
ry generous heart they will receive that corfl
miferation ; and while the mind runs over
the whole tryingfcene, the tears which must
involuntarily flow will embalm their memo
ry.' -. â¢ i; " iy f ,. |
Having closed the general scene, we 'think
it will not be unacceptable to wr readers,
if we uotice the conduct of some individuals
âA Quarter Mailer belonging to the ship,
by the name of M'Gregor, had his wife on
beard ; they were a reipe&able couple, and
greatly attached to each otherâM'Gregor,
from his affectionate solicitation for herfafc
ty, endeavored to persuade her, while the
fliip lay on the (hoals, to go afliore in one
of the boats which came off from the Ul
and, as his mind would be more ateafe, could
he put her iu a place of fafety ; to his so
licitations (he replied, " that file uever
would abandon him ; if it was his lot to pe
rish, (he wished not to furvjve him." Find
ing it in vain to urge her further, he dÂ«2ll
ed from the attempt, and she afterwards
shared the common fate. A conliderablc
time after the ship had foundered, a man was
discovered swimming towards the wreck.
On hii approaching near, it was found'to be
M'Gregor, he informed his comrades who
were hanging by the wreck, that he had
swam towards the (hore, that he had ventu
red as far as he could with fafety into the
furf, and found if he went further, he should
be dashed to pieces, and he cautioned them
all to avoid making the like attempt, but
if possible to hold by the wreck. He him
felf gained the main shrouds, and remained
there till the mast gave way, and then met
the, feme fate as his unfortunate consort,
wkofe death he was continually deploring
while on the shrouds.
Dunlap relates another instance which oc
curred, wh(fh though it may appear ludi
crous, after the distressing scenes we have
noticed, is too descriptive of that cool
thoHghtlcffuefs of danger that so often dis
tinguishes our Brilifh tars, that it would be
inexcufeable to omit it. Daniel Munro,
â¢toe of the survivors, had, as well as Dun
lap, got into tbÂ» for*top ; after a-while he
difappeartd, and it was concluded, he had
been washed away wii;h many others ; after
an absence from the top about two hours,
he suddenly popped his head up the lubber
hole to the surprize of Dunlap, who enquir
ed where he had been ; he said he had been
cruising for a better birth ; and it appeared
that after swimming about the wreck for a
considerable time he had Atsroed to the
fore fhrÂ«nÂ»J# r cÂ«vrkd in on the cat-har
pins, and had actually been asleep there
more than an hour, and he said he wast and
really appeared to be greatly refrefhed,
Mr. Brcnian of the dock-yard, who had
gone on board with Mr. Rackum, after the
finking of the ship, had got on the main
top, and remained there till the main-mast
gave way, and was never after seen.
While noticeing the immediate disasters
of the ship, we forbare to mention the fate
of one of the boats which had gone from
George's Island. About nine o'clock as
the Slip went off, the boat got under the
ship's bow and was upset, by this circum
stance a part of the men, confiding of 2 fer
jeants, and 4 privates of the Royal Nova
fcotia. regiment were unfortunately drown
ed ; the remainder were taken up by the
boat belonging to the Eastern battery.
Too much praise cannot be given to the
men who manned these boats, and
larly toferjeant Baker, and the boat's crew
who persevered in following the ship, and
finally brought off lieutenants Campbell and
North of the royal Fusiliers. Great praise
is alfe due to the dock-yard bpat, which
carried Mr. Rackum en board, they follow
ed the ship .at a short distance, till she foun
dered, and with extreme difficulty at length
reached Herring Cove. We are sorry to
learn, that Mr. Rackum, ivhÂ©fÂ£ exertions
on board La Tribune, to preserve the ship,
were gratefully acknowledged, perished
with the unhappy ship's company.
Having mentioned all the difafterou3
circumstances which have attended this
distressing scene, it is with pleasure we now
notice the attention which has been paid to
the widows and children of the unfortunate
fuffeters. His royal highness prince Ed
ward, with' that uniform generality which
has distinguished his royal highness during
his reiidence in this province, dire&ed im
mediate provision to be made for the be
reaved families, and there is reason to hope
through his royal highness' representations,
that provision will be made as permanent as
their fufFerings. Adtions like these digni
fy even kings, and add splendor to the
highest rank.
Besides the attention shewn by his royal
highness, a liberal fubferiptjon has been
made by the garrison, for the widows of the
soldiers, who were drowned, afid..fn> the
â¢men who manned the boats.
There is another inflanee of gefltrefity
which the occasion seems Hi require, and it
seems to be the earnell wish of the men wjio
were saved from the wreck ; it is that some
reward may be beftowrd on the boy.who
firit came off to them. They attribute in
a great meafnre their deliverance to him,
and they mention with the warmed .grati
tude, not only his exertions to save them
from the wreck, but his kind and hospita
ble attentioa to relieve them after they had
reached the cove. Surely if a fubferiptioa
was set on foot, there is not a man in the
country who would not give something to
reward and encourage so young an inftaftce
of hunrant and heroic magnanimity.

Mr. Fennel, the firii lieutenant, and Mr.
Galvin, the mailer's mate were both for
merly prisoners at Guadaloupe, with col.

Fennel declared to lieut, Campbell, that his

not, for if he had, though he was himfelf
io a place of apparent security, he would

FRENCH SPOLIATIONS.
To the Editor of the Columbian Mirrsr
Six,
IN a former paper I communicated fa you
a lijl of tie number as vcjfcls and cargoesfeiied
by French eruifers and condemned in their ports
with the value of the fame. On a more accu
rate invefligation, I find / mat deficient in tht
number ; and I am warranted in asserting,
that the value, in/lend of three, is little short of
four hundred thousand dollarsâto corYeS this
however, is not my motive for troubling you at
present.
It is, fir to fuggefl to my fellow fuffsrer *.
through the medium of your paper, the proprie
ty of calling a general meeting < its objeS tote,
the appointment of a committee to tolled and arm
range all the documents relative to these losses ;
far certainly it will be much better effeQed
collectively, than individually ; this committee
may be ordered to procure at the general ex
pence further proof, where such may appear
waiting, and moreover be injlruÃed to prepare
a memorial to Cungrcfs grounded on the etfi
derue before them-, and to correspond with the
Secretary of State, as circumflances may re
quire.
It is well known, and a faS not to be
controverted, that the mercantile tody of the
Union have -been and now are, the jirme/lfup
portersof the laws and government of the United
States ; that they ha ve been the immediate fourct
from whence has been drawn the revenue
that ought " to provide for the common de
fence, and promote the general welfare." 'lf
any man denies or even doubts this, lei him look
to tht reports of the Secretary of the Treasury
on the i*ecefpts and expenditures of the United
States, or let me ask him from whence was the
' i reafury supplied, which paid for a tedious and
txpenfive Indian war, orfuppreffed a flill mare
dangerous infurreSion,* which threatened the
very exigence as the government ? Was it not
from commerce ? If these fcSs then bespeak its
importance to the general welfare, and this useâ¢
ful class of citizens have been prohibited by
law from the natural right of felf defence
:n protecting their property from lawless vio
lence and in confiquence thereof have fujftred by
the ruthless hands of'the French plunderers, on
what principle can the general government deny
their claim to competition. Will it not [be
mare honorable to fuppafe, that found policy as
well as the immutable principle of yufiice, will
didate the expediency as a well timed retribution
tothefyfferers f Under this tmprejjion, Iflrong
ly recommend a general meeting as a prepar
c.tary jfep,for whatever may happen connected
with this business.
I am, Sir,
Tour mofl obdt, Servant.

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, i gj;
â¢ ' twi
FRIDAY DECEMBER 29. (<j
Mr. J. Parker aiked and obtained leave wfl
of abfeix e for Mr. S. Smith for ten day*.
Oh the Speaker s informing the house, Â£â  '
that the unfinished bufinefa of yesterday, orc
related to the remanftrance: of the Legifla- j.
ture of the state of TenneftCe, had the pri- â¢
ority of other business,
i Mr. Coit said, as the information called
fur from the Secretary of War, was not
yet received, he hoped tbit bufmefs would pj.
be postponed till Tuesday nextâAgreed.
On motion of Mr. D. Foster, the house
resolved itfelf into a committee of the whole
on the report of the committee of claims on
the petition of Comfort Sands, and others ( - Q|
âM r - Kittera in the chair ; and all the pa-
pers restive to the fubjeft having been read
by the the following resolution re
ported by the committee of claims was a-
Mtedxo, without debate, viz- Ep
of the Trvafury be, and they are hereby em
authorized -id empowered, upon applica
âº aionof die parties, to examine and decide rej
upon the validity of a certain award or re
port made by Isaac Roosevelt, William
Malcolm, Elbridgc Gerry, and Henry . g (
RemfeM (four of the referees nominated
for the purpose) between the United State*
and Comfort Sands and others, his co-part- an
uers (contraftor3 for furnifhing supplies to
the troops during the late war) and that in
malting their decision upon the said award
or report, the said officers of the Treasury '
fjiall be governed. by principles similar to Â£
those which would prevail in a eontroverfy j. (
> concerning it at law ; and if the opini-
* y* of the accounting officers aforefaid, the
said award or report ought to be binding
and obligatory against the United States, .
then, and in such cafe, but not otherwise, j
the said Comfort Sands an|d others, his said
co-partners, (hall be entitled to have the
said claim against the United States, as on
the said award allowed and fettled at the
Treasury, in the usual manner, and (hall be j
paid the amount of the claim, so to be al-
lowed, out of any monies which may be |
in the Treasury not otherwif* appropri- ,
ated."
The committee rose, reported the reso
lution, and the house took it up ; when j
Mr. Nicholas objeftedto agreeing to the !
report, and Mr. Gallatin moved that the p
subject be re-committedfor a report of faftt
on the fubjeft. I e ,
The state of thiÂ» long contested question
Appears to be as follows :
TW petitioners fame time in the year
1782 contrasted with the Superintendent of
the finances, for the supply of rations far
the use of the garrison of Weft Point and j
its dependencies, and also for the use of the v
main army ; that before the expiration of
the tern of their contrast, it was
proper or necessary, by the said fuperinten
dant, that the bufinef* of supply Ihould be., c
withdrawn from tktn, and placed in other
hands ; a claim to be indemnified for daraa
ges and losses, alledged tftKave been fuf- {
tained, was made on the part of the con- (
"(raftors ; in consequence of which feveial {
resolution* were passed by Congress, that
1 four of the referees appointed hy, and in
pursuance of the said jefolutions, in the
year 1787, made an award or report, ex 1
pre (five of their decision or opinion, that ; {
the United States ought to pay to the said j (
contraftors, the sum of 40,297 dollars and |
4-90ths parts ef a dollar ; that the award or
report was, by Congress, referred for exa- j j
mi nation to a committee, whp reported in , (
favor of its being confirmed, but that report (
was afterwards committed to another com
mittee, who never, as far as can be traced, ' |
made any report ; neither has there be*n a
ny decision of Congress oh the fubjeftâ (
that the reasons whioh induced the reference
to a second committee do not appear ; that
application having beer made to the ac
counting officers of the Treasury, tor a de
termination on the said award, it has been
concluded that they were not competent to
the fame, without the special authority of
thelegiflature. -
The principal arguments used by Messrs.
Gallatin and Nicholas were, that this claim
was altogether novel, being grounded up
on damagtt sustained, and not upon adual
fuppliet fum'tfhtd ; that no allowance ef this
kind had ever been made that if
once there were to be eftabliflied a principle,
that wherever damages had been sustained in
jnoney tranfaftipns with government, recom
pence (hould be made, they would open a
wide door for business, as there was scarcely
any person who had dealings with govern
ment during the war> that would not be a
ble to make a claim of this kind, from the
then emharraffitd state of the treasury ; that
the claim being of a novel kind, its merits
ought to be -well examined, before it was
allowed ; that there was nothing in the claim
which would render it admiffiblc, were it
not for the repott or award j that this a
ward, in their opinion, was intended as no
thing more than an enquiry as to facts,
which was to be laid befxf congress, and
decided upon by them ; that therefore the
report before them was improper, as it re
ferred business to the accounting officers of
the treasury, to which they were incompe
tent, and which ought to be fettled in that
house ; that this was very different from a
wards made betwixt individuals, where both
parties pledged themfel'es to abide the con
fequenccs ; nor was there an instance to be
produced ia whichconjrefs had thusl author
ized an award ; that though onÂ« of the re
foluiions entered into by them, authorized
the referrees " to decide certain controver
fie* between the United States and the con
traflors, yet it concluded with " and report
their tpinien thereupon that the condufl
of cengrefs itfelf (hewed that this reference
was not meant as a final award j t at if jt
bad, instead of refering the report hrft- to
â¢
one committee and .to Another, they ' *
; would have *t orr^-ap^r'.ipriated the money I
â¢ and not committed it lovfuribtr enquiry ;
.but, allowing that the award could be con
| fidcrcd -in the fame light as an a .ard be-1
twixt individuals, ftiU it would be proper I Si
ta examine the ground upon which the a-
ward was founded.
Messrs. J. Parker and Findley, were jp J de
favor of the motion for a re-committal, i(i I ret
order that thelioufe might be in full poflef- I dil
(ion of faGs in a business which had been a- I on
gitated ever since they were in congress, and tei
which had alway* been considered -as a very Cc
doubtful cafe. n ri
The report was supported by Meffirs. ou
Harper, Sprague, Brookes, Coit, J. Wil- M
liams, Bayard, Livingfton, Goodrich, O- th
tis and Gordon, these grounds, viz. Fc
That;the course pursued in this cafe was th
similar to that which is usual in the fubmif- hii
fion of sontroverfies between individuals, to co
arbitration ; that tlfcre was a mutual elec- mi
tion and consent in the appointment of the I m;
person* who were to make the investigation ; j
that they werecxprefsly deaominatedmrEÃ- j
ees;thattheyaÂ£tedi<n</<;r j e(
reprefenting the government, was j S'
empowered to employ counsel, if necessary I 10
that the referrtj are authorised, by . the firft J
resolution, to determine what damages, if a- I
ny, were sustained hy the qontra&ors, and I
1 by the last resolution, their duty or business |
is designated to be to " dec>de certaiu contro- 1 rc
vetjies," between the Unjted Slates and j Â°'
1 the contra&ors j tha these chara&eriftics, j
and the general spirit of the tranfaftion, j
appear to denote, that the report of the re- j
' ferees in the cafe, ought to be considered as I fe
equivalent to an award between individuals I w
possessing the fame validity, and equally o- | 1
* pen to exceptions ; that, as to the provi- I "
r fion made by the several resolutions, that j V
the referees /hould report their opinion to
Congress : this, it is conceived, could only I b<
have been intended to reserve to Congref* a 1 nt
' right of reviewing the award oh the fame f'
j principle*, bonajiae, as would prevail in a |
court of justice; the observation* of t :
e gentlemen opposed to this claim, were such C (
as might have been properly urged when the | U
question far appointing arbitrators was be
e fore the old Congress, but that they were {
very ill-timed how ; and that the argument
of the cafe having been a very long time be- p
fore Congress, was a strong reason for a- I w
grieing to the report, that justice might at K
" | length be done to the claimants.
I The question for re-committing the re-1 t i
port was put and negatived 48 to 29. tl
The Report was then agreed to, without
a division, and the Committee of Claims P
ordered to bring in a bill accordingly.
' n j Mr. D. Foster moved, that when the n
house adjourn, it adjourn to Monday.
Mr. Harper proposed Tuesday.
5 The question on the most distant day,
was taken and negatived 41 to 31 and then 1 s
the firft motion was agreed to without a di- t
le ~ b 1
virion. t
j Mr. Livingfton, from the committee of 1 0
commerce and manufa&ures, wi(hed that I
committe to be discharged from the farther I J
>e "' CtmfideraHon of the petition of Geo. Gnr-1
C 1 wan Ward, that it might be referred to the I <

their consideration. Agreed and the pro- j ,
posed reference made. I 1
l ie The fame gentleman, alXo made another I 1
report on the petitions ofO. Cooke, Abiel 1 j

a Mr. J. Williams said that at the time the I

neither he nor the publÂ».',Â» ouUV,eyi;r hi ard >
from me againâBut when ("hear so triflinp a

United States, who would willingly receive, aad
thereby becouie (lie patron, of a firiei ol letters,

What does all the writer's declamation ia your m
paper of Tuesday evening amount to ? Why, that ,
war i>an undefirabl* alternative; it generally the
gneateft of evili; and therefore aught to be avo'.d- "
ed i/ poflible. There is not a blockhead who struts tl
the flrecu but wftat knew this beforeâand yet th
the wife " friend" is obtruding this at advice on u|
the Senate. .
If his objeA was, at he Attempted some time
paQ, to ihew that it was impolitic to permit out 6
merchants to arm, he might as pertinently have jr
recited one of Hervey't evening meditations a- w
mong the tombs. | r
It w an important question, whether by permit
tiHg our merchauta to defend their property on the
high feiÂ» against unlawful aggression, Congress
will put at hazard the puce of the countryâThis f<
all-important question 1 (hall leave to wiser heads c
than mine to determine. Sure 1 am, that nothing j (
thu " friend" hat yet ftid, has thrown any light .
on the fubjeiS. , s â  '
One word upon the remarks the " friuid" was O
pleased to make in your paper of the 19th upon
my previous observations on hit reasoning.
He' supposed I would " lay a wager to convince
Congress that I alone eÂ»uld think or argue"âl
did not write, as he profeffed to, for the purpose
of influencing Congressâl liad not the vanity to '
think my writings would have that tendencyâ 1
My only objedl was to espofe to merchants (the 1
well informed of whom however did not need the v
erpofnre) the absurdity of his opinionsâAnd yet (
I will confcfs, that "although 1 never Uy a wjger,
it might have been at pertinent on that occafiou at '
the argumcnu (if 1 may so call them) of the '
" friend." NotwithftaudiHg thit observation, I 1
profefo with him, to treat with Jut refpcS, the .
sentiments of those who differ with me
If I could poflibly be induced on any fubjedt to
lay a wager with of winning, it
wouldhe that a greiit majority 6f your readers be- I
gin by this time to be powe- fully imprelled with a
bditf that the "fiiend" It in fomc way or other

the art of bombast in the highest degree ; for
s Which Ido not think General Waftington will
thank himâlt will require more notes than hit (4)

at the readtnefs with wliich the StateLegiflature
S areabout to yield to the folicitatiosa of the Bank
1- of Pennsylvania, for vesting their Cashier with
powers ofa Notary Public âDo the Legislature
consider how inconliftent those twoappointmeÂ«tt
are--Do they corifyief how essentially this will
''' ehange the principles of a legal controverly
Ce which an individual may hive with that inftitu
-2" tion, by authorising odc party to givÂ« evidence
id in his own cause : tor it is a fair and juflifiable
couclnfrtiij that under the influence of I* efprif
, e du corpsthe luUitution as well as (e'lf-julti
nt flcation, that as individual cannot rely on the in
dependent teftimopy of any Ca(hief is he cow

LETTER hi
From Mr. Jefurfon, late minister of the U
nited States in France, and-fecretary to po
the department of foreign affairs, to a ci
tizen of Virginia.
This letter, literdlly translated, is addrciT
ed to M. Mazzei, author wf Rsfcarches, fw
hillorical an(i political,', upon r- the, United n c
States of America, now resident in Tufcany. fjp
" Otir political fituatien is prodigiously ft a
changed fincc yon left us. Instead of that w(
noble love of liberty, and tPiat republican ta
government, which carried us triumphantly a t
through the dangers of th' war, an angleâ rc
I monarchicoâarillocratic party has arifcti. E d
Their avowed objeÂ£t is to impose on us'the foi
fybflanie, as they have already given us the eo
form, of the British government. Never
theless the principal body of our citizens ye
remain faithful to republican principles. All pi;
our proprietors>>f lands are friendly ta those un
prinaiples, as also the tnafs ps men of tal- an
cats. We have against us (republicans) the oc
executive power, the judiciary power, (two Fi
of three branches of our government) all the
officers of government, all who are feeling offi
ces, all timid men who prefer the calm of defpo- bl
tifm to the tcmpcflususfea of liberty, the Brit- dc
ijh merchants and the Americans who trade on ye
British capitals, the fpicj.ators, per funs inter- q{
ejled in the lank and the public funas. [Eft- a
â¢blilfflfffcnts invented with views of corrup- f 0
tion, and to afiimilate us t* the British mo- C e
del in its corrupt parts.}.
" I (hould give you a fever, if i {hould fj,
name the apostates who have embraced these /p
heresies ; meh who were Solomons in coun- d<
fcil, and Sampsons in combat, but whofc hair C r
has been cut off by the whow of England. f 0
[ln the original, parlacatin d'Angleterre,- re
probably alluding to the woman's cutting jg
off the hair of ijampfon, and his loss of a
strength thereby.] tr
" They would wrest from 11s that liberty
which we have obtained by so much labor p
and peril ; but we shall preserve it. Our 1 0
mass of weight and riches is so powerful, tJ
that we have nothing to fear from any at- tl
tempt against ns by force. I)? is fufficient f e
that we guard ourselves, and that we breai
the Lilliputian ties by which they have bound p.
us, in the firft (lumber! which succeeded our t j
labors. It fuffices that we arrest the pro- j r
grefs of that system of ingratitude and in- e;
justice toward* France, fronj which they ft
would alienate us, to bring us under Eritifti tl
influence, See." tl
[The foregoing letter wears all the ex- \ 2
ternal mark* of authenticity. And yet it n
seems hardly poflible an American could be
capable of writing such a letter. As the
letter is cireulating in Europe, we deem it
just, if a forgery, to give Mr. Jefferfon an y
opportunity to disavow it.] fc

The city of London have voted thanks c
to admiral Duncan, and all the officers and

with a sword valued at 100 guineas. Also ,
direfted to be paid to a fubfeription /
opened for the widows aud orphans of sea- t
men who fell in the conflict. 2900 guineas i
were fubferibed by individuals for the fame
purpose.

p decided that our vessel was a good prize.â
g Then sent the brig's boat full of men on

LONDON, Oftpber 18.
Lad nigVlt ,a Dutch Sailor, armed with $
sword, planted himfelf on the road fi<J?
near Pcptford where he attacked every pafa
fengei with the molt bNital ferocity. H?
stabbed a young woman in the bread, and
wounded several Gentlemen, but none mofi
tajly. After a desperate refiftancc he wai
at la(jt orerpowered by numbers, coaÂ»
vcyed to thi; yvatch-houfe, where he declar
ed it was his intention to destroy every pei>
son he met, in revenge for the defeat of his 5
countrymen..
Admiral de Winter is between 35 and 40
years of age. He is a tall, handsome man,
plain in his manners, and joins to the
undaunted courage, an uncommon ardar
and aftivity, as be has evinced on various
occasions. He is a Major GenÂ«ral in the
French service,
OAoher 20.
The Stadtholder has now a very formids?
ble navy in the British ports ; it ie a very
point howevnr, whether in the t>
vent of his restoration h? would carry many
of them back with him. There would be
a gpod many charges for keeping and repair,
for the payment of which he would be for,
ced to leave them inpaivn.
The Pope, it is laid has been again csn
fpiring against the French republic. This
infallible head of the C.hurch is now in his
dotage, but it *ertamly is 'extremely indif
ereet in his friends not to give him# chanco
for dying at home in peace. They should
recoiled*,, that though young Princes and
Bijhops may do well to roam about Europe,
a man of 80 is rather too fold tQ begin hit
travels.
It argues a great deal of simplicity in thq
French commissioners at Lisle to wait any
longer for lord Malmelbury. If the dura,
tion of their appointments depends upon
this event, they may reckon upon having
secured very comfortable ftnecures for life.
It is a miserable proof of the happiness and
pjtfper'tty of a coftntry, when a lik?
that ps Lord Duncan's is attended with ng
imperceptible rife of the funds, no lively
expectation of peace, and when even ths
fnpporters. of ministry in the city checked
their transports by recolle&idg that whas
they with for, and dare not ask, may bs dÂ«,
layed by one of othcr<wife the mod fortu,

Â»Â« New-Theatre,.
if- December 11, 1797.
ve I 'HE Manacsrs particularly requef. the con
y- 1- currence of the public in the abolition of a
cudom, which has hitherto obtained, of giving a
r. way or disposing of RETURN CHECKS at thÂ«
Theatre.
to They are aware that gentlemen are unconscious
of any wrong dene to the interest of the inftitu
r- tion by thispraflice, from a general, though nÂ»if
c" taken idea that Checks are the reprcfentatives of a
right to so many featÃ in tlie Theatre, during an
â¢' Evening's Entertainment, and transferable at will;
â¢ when in fa&, they were never intended as more
than token by which the Poor-keepers are enabled
1( j to ascertain with the least trouble to the partier,\.htt
a they themfehee have been before in the Theatre, or
paid for their admiflion.
lt Independent of the iajury the Managers sustain,
n such a praAice encourages a croud of idle boys and
5, Â°thÂ«r disorderly p*rfonÂ« to surround the doors of
!t the Theatre, to the oorruption of their morals and
â¢e the great annoyance of the Audience.
f It has also beÂ«n the fouree of two evils of no in
- confidcrabie magnitude; one iÂ», that fometimcs
I, very improper company is by these maans admit
it ted ; tnd the other, that owinâ< to Checks palling
into tiifhoneft hands, they have be.n frequohaly
" counterfeited to a large amount for the purpofesof
" Sale
0 This statement will, it is refpedlfully hoped, in
duce the Public to dlfcourage such a traffic : and
â¢ the exertions of the Managers will, if thus assisted,
easily prove adequate to its entire abolition
