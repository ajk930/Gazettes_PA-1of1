â¢Â« We understand, (fays the Majfachufetts 1
Mercury,) that Citizen Barney's conduft is j 1
cenSsred by the French Government. It j t
is Said he has uSed his Squadron for his own ' 1
emolument, rather than the good of his Di-
reftors: and that the most enormqus allow- 2
ances for his convenience and entertainment,
have been made by the St. Domingo Com\ '
miffioners, without the knowledge or con- '
sent of the republic." a
Upon a thorough invelligation, it is pro-
bable that the French Government will find
that " enormous*-allowances have been made
for the convenience and entertainment of othier
" patrotic" Gallo-Americans, besides Citi
%en Barney. It is well known, that during
the more turbulent periods of the revolution, Â£
â when one party held the reins of power no
longer than till another gained fufficient ,
strength to drag the leaders to the Scaffold,
thpt some who left America, bankrupts in v
point of property, and went to France, ob
tained employments under the feecefiive
fadtions which deluged that country in 1|
crimes and blood,, by which, from the " en- t ,
ormous allowances made for the convenience :
and entertainment," as well as to Requite their y
ferv'ues, they have amafTed immense for- |,
tunes. Some have been uncharitable enough
to foggeft that, in the consequent confuGon
eoucamitant Â«u continual change; in the
controlling councils of France, the ,eviden
ce; of property entnifted to the diipofal of
agents in behalf of the French nation, were
put out ofjighi, and that no documents could
afterwards be found toeffeft a Settlement:
others have fnppofed the existenCe of a ver
bal contrail between the then ruling party
D of the day, and the persons employedâ and
when the ruler became Subjected 'to the na
tional razor, the advantage of coUrse rested
wi?h the agent who had pi'evioufly received
% the cafh-âea(h proceeded from the sale of na-
I tional domainsâbut much oftner stripped
le from victims whose blood had formed rivulets
- under the guillotine, in confequenee of its
lc being laid to their charge, that they were
rich.âWhile the diredtory may be pursuing
meafurei to rid France of the last remains of
d those vultures who have been preying upon
is vitals of nation, and " driving from office"
ie such as have countenanced the piracies upon
'* the property of neutral powers, in the course
of their proceedings they will undoubtly find
that much treasure has been lavilhed for the
g. " convenience and entertainment'' of agents at
o home and abroadâAs far as America has
afforded refuge to those who have been con
' veniently entertained, at tbeexpenfe of France,
a for purpoSes fubver'five of the neutrality and
, honour of our country,it is a happy circum
n /lance that the vigilance of Government,
and the watchfulnefs of those who have
0 been entrusted with the management of pub
is concerns,as yet have been able to coun
e tera<ft every nefarious plotâand it is sincere
ly hoped that such may be the change of
sentiment and measures in France, that diS
grace will soon be conSrdcred as attached to

who have aided a conduft long witnessed

?: â¢ .
r The judicious and/independent Editor of
the New-York Daily Gazette,.makes the
! following remarks on a letter, recently pub
t lifhed, disclosing the French scheme for
. burning the capital towns of America.
Â£lf the above extract be true, what are
the citizens of the United States to think
of the conflituted authorities of their great
al}y ? The appointment of Santhonax to
to the chief command of St. Domingo, was
one among the numberless bad effects of
[ the faftiou3 spirit which has prvailed ia
, France ever since the revolutionâPrevious
to his mission to that unfortunate colony,
i last spring, his administration there, had ex
â¢ hibited decisive proofs of his qualifications
to destroy, and his titter incapacity to re
storeâbut, in spite of this convidiionâin
spite of the lpirited remonstrances of the
colonial agents who prediÂ«3ed the eventual
and speedy ruin of the whites, and the de
teflable elevation of the negroes over their
headsâin spite of the prayers and tears of
proprietorsâin spite of the obvious interests
of the mother country, as well as of the
colonies which could only be advanced by a
mild and equitable government, and with
out which, infteadofan advantage they must
neceflarily be an incumbrance to France -
In spite of all these important confident kins,
that unhappy predominating spirit of fadtion,
carried its point, and delegated this moil
odious of all tyrants to exercise the supre
macy in that unfortunate ifiandâThecon
fequenccs are well knownâThe nervous apd
pathetic speech of Vaublanc in the council
of 500 on this interesting fubjeft, which
drew tears of indignation from the mem
bers, against the criminal authoc of the vil
lainies perpetratedâwas only the prelude of
his recallâand it is hoped his fate, when ar
raigned before an impartial tribunal, if any
such ex ills in France, will be that of all ty
rants who are compelled to account for their
conduit. The known disposition of thin
man and the general tenor of his administra
tion in St. Domingo are fufficient to (lamp
the fadts contained in the preceding letter
with the seal of authenticity. That he is
an enemy of this country is undoubted
and that to injure us as far as podible would
.be the highest gratification to the feelings
of his diabolical foul, is equally trueâBut j
there is another confederationâHis enmity
against the emigant colonists, is most bitter ;
every measure he could devise to injure them
would naturally be pradtifedâKnowingthey
are retired to the United Statesâand reside
in the principal cities, the most eligible way
of persecuting them would be to expose the
small remains of their former opulence, to
the ravages of conflagration - and as this
must neceflarily involve in its effects two
classes against whom he harbored the great
est maliceâthe emigrant French, and the 1
citizens of the United States ; he engaged
a troop of incendiaries to come over and set
fire to our towns'.
After this information, who can doubt 1
the source of the evils which the several ci- 1
I ties in various states Suffered by fire last win- i
; ter ; and the numberless attempts made in I
| this particularly ; though by the care of <
Providence, and the vigilance of our citi- <
zens, unfuccefsfully. We trust a similar 1
spirit of vigilance will be manifefted the pre- <
sent autumn and winter ; for it appears that
these vile missionaries of fire and deftrudtion, J
after returning to their employer at St. Do- (
mingo, received the promised reward, and <
had set out again for the United States on <
a similar errand. They must then be among j
us. Let us therefore beware of French- t
men ! They are Sacrificing us wherever 1
they can at sea, plundering and robbing our -
property and abusing our persons ; and if i
they can do it with impunity by land, will 1
it riot be undertaken ? There are undoiibt- t
' edly men among those now in this country, t
who pofTefs honor and principle ; and <
whoSe profeffions of gratitude for the asylum t
afforded them, are Sincere : Such deserve 1
regard, efleem and protedtion ; but the {
Scoundrels who join our own degraded par- j
ty of Jacobins, and, in conversation as well <s
as pamphlets, vilify the people and the go- c
vernment of the United States, deserve to a
be expelled with abhorrence, as intrusive f
pells, and dangerous enemies to our internal j,
tranquility and SaSety. p
This will pot be thought Severe when it \
â  is recolK;Â£te(i that the (hip Mount Verhon,
f which was captured last spring, at the
: mouth of the Delaware, and carried to the
1 Weft-Indies, Was condemned on the autho
: rity of letters from some rascally Frsnch
- men who declared the property tobeEnglifh.
f When such unprincipled ingrates are
1 found among a certain class of men, the
- whole are pften fufpefted, as it is' difficult
1 to draw the line of discrimination ; and if
1 any severities are uttered against the French
" by the people of this country, it is obviouf
-1 ly the effect of their own condu&. <â¢, The'in
s tiocent and well-intentioneql are too fre
â¢ fluently involved in the stigma ; but in the
â  present instance wc are Confciotis that there
r , art large ntimbers of innocent unfortunate
f emigrants among;us who deserve commife
-1 ration for their fufferings, instead of being
' fufpefted of villainy.

A DtTBIOPIMEIIT Of T;HE CAUSES OFTHfi
i DISTURBANCES BETWEEN TH AMERI
CAN AND FRENCH REPUBLICS.
, Addrejfed to the Citizens of America.
1 MY FEtLOW-CITIZENS,
THE letter said to be written by Mr.
, Jefferfon to M. Mazzei (after stating the
change which it is there said had taken place
from our former love of liberty and repuili
â  canifm, to an anglo-monarchico-ariftocratic
disposition) proceeds thus : " Nevertheless,
the principal body of of 6ur citizens remain
faithful to republican principles. All our
1 proprietors of lands are friendly to those
; grineiples, as also the mass of men of talents.
1 We have against us (republican's) the ex
ecutive power, the judiciary power, (two of
the three branches of our government) all
: the officers of government, all who are seek
ing offices, all timid men who prefer the
â  calm of despotism to. the tempestuous sea of
liberty, the British merchants and the A
mericans who trade oh British capitals, the
fpeculatprn, persons interested in the bank
arid public funds. [Eftablifhriients invented
with views of corruption, and to assimilate
us to the British model in itscorrupt parts.]"
This is one of the parts of the letter so
injurious to Americaâone of those very
mifreprefcutatiom, spoken of by Mr. Pinck
. ney, which have brought oar misunderstand
ings with Fratiee upon 4s !âBy which, to
use his own words, they " entertain the
humiliating idea that we are a people divided
by party, the mere creatures of foreign in- 1
fluenee , and regardless of our national cha
ra&er, honor and interest," have become '
the fit objefts for them to cxercife their will '
and power on. It is their belief of this .very
difference between the views of our goxern- i
ment and the wishes of the people, spoken
of in this part of the letter to Mazzei, there
is no doubt, which has induced them to a&
the part they have towards us. Here it is j
said, that the people of America and their
in dire it opposition to each
other; consequently, that it is the natural
Wish of the one, to get rid of the other
And along with this fair declaration of the
desire, gots every possible encouragement
and invitation to join in the attempt. " The
prtneifat toJy vf â Â«<Â«Â»Â«â < remain,faithful
to republican principles ! All our proprietors
of lands are friendly to those principles, as
also the mass of men of ta'ents t While we
'hare against 11s only the ex
ecutive, the judiciary, the officers of govern
ment, a few Jpeculatirr, and all timid men.
Therefore, come on ye Frenchmen ! You
have only to declare it, and- this contempti
ble faftion, called the American government,
is at once annihilated !I" This is the fair
declaration made in this part of the letter,
aud the absolute proposals made to the
French people by such declarations.
Well might Mr. Pinckney fay, indeed,
that it had been owing to mifreprtfentations
"of the people and our government, that our
disturbances with France had been brought
upon us : For from whither else could these
disturbances have possibly proceeded If
there had been no misrepresentations, there
would have been nothing for them to have
quarrelled with ; for such are the principles
of our government, that whatever are the
dispositions of the people, such abso
lutely must be the operations of it ;
and consequently, if the dispositions of
the people had been what is there
said they were, those afts of the go
vernment, which were their abfoluteqreating,
would never have gained the difplealure of
the French, while the spirit and dispositions
of the people obtained their approbation.
A correft knowledge of the principles of the
American government, and the aiElual dis
positions of the people towards the opera
tions of that government, would have left
no room for an enmity towards the one, and 1
a friendfhip for the other. It was only,
therefore to a misrepresentation of those prin- '
eiples and those ditpofitions that so absurd a
eontradi&ion could ever have been attri- :
buted ; and it is in that contradiction, most 1
certainly, that all our differences exifl. 1
I have already shewn the glaring mifrepre- .
fentations with refpeft to the principles of 1
our government. It only now remains to I
shew those which relate to the dispositions 1
of the people towards the operation of it : 1
And in doing this, it will be necessary still 1
to hold in idea the principle of the govern
ment themselves. By the confutation of ;
America, it is clear, that all the great and I
important officers of the government, on 1
whom the operations of it depend, are erf- :
tirely dependent on the will of the people for j i
their existence. If therefore, " the prin- 1
eipal body of our citizens, all our propric- ' 1
tors of lands, and all the mass of men of ta- !
lents, remain faithful to republican princi- 1
pies," as no doubt they do, how can it i
possibly happen, that theft should " have j
againjl them, an executive and judiciary" of f
contrary principles ? Would the people, who J
are thus armed with all the powers of the t
government, eledl an executive, and they a <
judiciary, direftly to oppose that very peo- c
pie's will ? The people might indeed for a t
while be deceived, asd call roes into office t
n. of principles contrary to their own ; but a
lc repetition of their eledtion,after their princi
ple pies were known, whatever those principles
0- might be, is a fair and unequivocal declara
h- tion of the principles of the people them
h. selves. .
re The executive of America, who were thus
le said to be opposed to the principles of thpfe
lit who elefted them, and who had themfilves
if elefted a judiciary, also opposed to those on
:h whose will they the'mfelves existed, were
if- twice elected ; the President by the unani
n- mous voice of the whole of the. American
e- people ; and at the approach of the third
ie election, the most anxious and decided dif
re position again to elect him ; and finally, on
te his declining to serve, the strongest fenti
e- ments of regret that ever accompanied any
ig man in his retirement from public service,
, together with the promotion of the vice
( president to his place, who for the two elec
tions preceding, had formed part of that
very executive those opposed to the will of
those' who elected them, form the very
6 JlrÂ° n g and clear proofs of the people and the
1- government of America being opposed to
each other : Added to which, every inflaace
in which the people have been "cal|ed on to
decide on to decide on the a&s of the execu
t. J tive, they have clearly and unequivocally
ie declared in their favor.
:e What were the efforts made in the cafe
j- of the proclamation of neutrality, to obtain
ic the disapprobation of ihepeoplel And what
s, was their abfohite and final decision in Â£on
in sequence of those efforts ? The conduit of
ir the executive was approved ; and the inftru
fe merit of JJanee who had been employed in
s. off?ndiiM*%oth the people and the govern
c- ment of America, was withdrawn. And in
'f the cafe of the treaty, at present the great
11 and pretended cause of complaint on the part
t- of France, the people not only decided by
ie their vote through their representatives on
)f the fubjeft of appropriations, but in their in-,
i- dividual and primitive capacities, were be
ie coming exceedingly uneasy and clamorous at
k the appearance of an opposition, until their
d representative will had been thus obtained in
e its favour. One glaring contiadiftion. res
" pe&ing the will of the people had the dif
o positions of our Government being in diredt
y opposition to each other, here defervts to be
:- noticed. Ou the Banking abd Funding
I- ' systems, the assumption and excise laws, the
0 head of the executive was accused of having
e laid the foundation of monarchy and atiftol
- cracy, by consenting to those afts of the
i- | legiflatifre, which were in faÂ£t the afts of
i- the people : and in the cafe of the treaty, he
e was accused of the fame disposition, for liav
-11 ' ing entirely disregarded the whole voice of
y t)ie people. Was the latter the truth, it would
- I afford the.highest paife ever offered to the
n : disinterested patriotism of a man ; facrifi
e : cing the only possible- personal consideration,
1 the love and admiration of the people (yi
is ; which his whole greatntfs had been found
r j ed, to what he, in his fo'itary opinion, con
h ceived to be his country's good. But the
d truth is, the President was in this latter cafe
- of the treaty, governed by the fame princi
e pie of administering that kind of govern
t ment which was the wilt of the majority, that
e he had been in fanftioriing the acts of the
'1 iÂ»egiflature in those former cotes.
t The will of the majority of the people of
s America in the banking, the funding fyf-'
e terns, &c. were conjliiutionally conveyed to
- him through the afts of both houfeso sCon
- grefs. That will, on which he acted in
. ligning the treaty, was conjliiutionally convey
l ed to him through the vote, in which it had
- two thirds of the Senate in its favor. To
, have refufed his signature in either cafe,
r would have been to have gone in. direst con
, tradiirtion to the will of the people in any
: way that will could have come to him, to
have been depended on. True it is, the
clamours against the treaty were very great
when it firft appeared, slut when it come
to be fairly understood, I believe it may be
truly said, thata great majority of the people
of America were in favour, even of its me
rits ; and with refpedt to its execution, af
ter it had been formed and fan&ioned by
the Senate and the Preident, there is no
qneftion of the dispositions of the people, in
its favour. But it will be faidTlnt it was
necessity and not choice, that made the
people anxious it should be carried into ef
fe3 at that particular stage of it. So was it
necessity and not choice, perhaps that Jed
to the negociation of it. What was the ne
cessity for carrying the treaty into effe& af
ter it had been adopted by the Senate and
President? To avoid a rupture with those
with whom it had been negociated.' What
else was the cause of that negociation ?
In what then has the will of the people,
or their principles, been in contradiftion with
the executive or judiciary; the pnerepu/i/i
---can, the others monorchia/ and arijlocratical ?
With refpeft to the judiciary, their dccilibns
on the points complained of by the French,
have been in ftridl conformity to the con
ftru&ions put upon our situation by the exe
cutive in their discussions on those points.â
Consequently, if those conftru&ions of the
Executive were consistent with'the sentiments
of the people, the judiciary was not opposed
to the people, as it is said. The most of
those conftrudtions,it is to be observed, were
begun and ably supported by Mr. Jefferfon
hitnfelf.
Early in the dispute between America
and France, Mr. Jefferfon, as Secretary of
State, established some of those very prin
ciples himfelf, in which it is said the people
and our government have so widely differed
since. In his commumcaeions with Mr.
Genet, we find the following doftrines laid
' down. Â«' I believe," fays his letter of the
24th of July, 1793, " 'hat by the general :
law of nations, the goods of a friend found
in the vessel of an enemy, are free, and the
goods of an enemy found in the vessel of a
friend, are lawful prize. Upon this princi
ple I presume, the British veffek have taken
the property of French citizens found in
our vessels, and I confefs I Ihould be at a loss
on what principle to reclaim it. It is true,
that sundry nations, desirous of avoiding
the inconvenience of having their veficls
â¢i flopped at sea, ke. hÂ»rh mftnnces
â¢ introduced by their special treaties, another
principle between them, tint enemy bot
toms (hall make enemy goods', and friendly
, bottoms goods ; but this is altoge
ther the effeft ofparticular<Teities, controul
ing in special cases the general principles of
the lawof England Has determined
to adhere to the rigorous principle.*' And
in his letter of August 16, 1793, to Gov
erned Morns, onrMinifterin Paris, on the
subject of M. Genet's condnft, he fay's,â
â¢' W* suppose it to have been long an efta
bliihtd principle of the law of nations, that
the goods of a friend are free iÂ« an enemy's
vessel, and the poods of an enemy, lawful
prize in the veffcls of a friend. We have es
tablished a contrary principle, that free (hips
(hall make free goods, in our treaties with
France, Holland and Prussia, it is our wish
to ellablifli it with other this
requires their consent also, and is a wcjrk ot
time. In the mean time they have a riÂ«ht
toaa on the general principle, (that enemies
goods are prize on board of neutrals with
out giving us or Trance cause of complaint."
Now, it is well known, that one of the
principal pretences of France, for her quar
rel with us, is, that by our .treaty with '
Great Britain, we have eftablilhed a prin
ciple with that nation, on that fubjeft,. con
trary to and more favourable, than is con
tained in our treaty with her ; and it is
principally on account of its. partiality to
Great Britain and enmity to the cause of
I ranee, it seems, that the government of
America has been charged with entertain
ing sentiments different from the people ;
the one monarchical and ariflocratic* âthe-
other republican. That we have made a
treaty with Great Britain, contrary ii) thap
refpeft, to the one made with France, therfr
is no fort of question. But as Mr. Jeffer
fon himfelf has very juflly observed, the
principle eftablilhed 10 our treaty with
I'ranee, of free flips making free goods, " it
altogether the effect of a particular stipu
lation fontroulmg in a special cafe the gene
ral principle of the law of nations 5" and
that contaired in our treaty with Great
Britain, is nothing more than an acknow
ledgment of a right, by special, treaty,
which (he held and was exercising to its
fullcft extent under that " general principle
of the law of r.r.tions." We have Mr.
Jefferfon's authority, that/the American
i government " wijhed to establish the fame
principle with ether nations, that had been
eflablifhtd in our treaties with France, Ho!-
land and Prussia meaning Grrtt Britain,
no doubt, as it was oii f(ie condudt of that
nation he was then particularly writing.
This, however, it seems, Great Britain,
when we came to negotiate, was npt dis
posed to agree to ; nor was she obliged, if
(lie thought the advantages to be gained by
it not a fufScient compensation for the re
linquifhment, to give up an advantage
which ihe held by the general principle of
the law of nations, because France or any
other nation had been so liberal on their
part: and this, it seems too, Mr. Jefferfon
knew at lead two years before that negotia
tion had been set on foot; for " England,"
fays he, " is determined to adhere to the
rigorous principle,"âviz. of enemy's pro
perty being lawful prize" when found in
neutral (hipsâants of this neither " Ame
rica nor' France have any cause to com
plain," agreeable to Mr. Jefferfon's opinion
itfelf. '
As far as Britifli or French principles,
mterefts, or the partiality or prejudices of
America towards either, are concerned,
there is no real difference then between the
fentiinents of the people and the conduct
of our government ; but on the contrary,
it is clearly and entirely a mistake in Mr.
Jefferfon, when he fays, that " we have
against vs (republicans) the executive power,
&c." since it is evident that the condud of
the executive, on those heads, is but the
of the principles and reafonitigs of
that very republican himfelf. Let* us next
near Mr. j fft .'son as an orator, haranguing
againjl himfelf on some general principles
which will apply to this particular point.
In his fpeeeh to the senate, the 6th*of
March, 17.97, after declaring his zealous
attachment to the cunflitution of the United
States, he fays, ft and no one more fin
cerdy prays, that no accident may call me
to ihe higher and more important function*
which the constitution eventually devolves
011 this office ; [of vice prelident.]
These have been juflly confided to the
eminent character who has.preceded me
here," [Mr. Adams] Â« wha'fe talents and
integrity have been known zw& revcredhy me
through a long course of years, have been
the foundation of a cordialsnd uninterrupt
ed friend/hip between us j- and I devoutly
pray, lie may be long preferred for the go
vernment, the happiness, and prosperity of
our common country;"âand yet, thiÂ»
verv Mr. Adams, for whom he his all this
cordial friend/hip, %vhofe talents and integrity
have been long known and revered by him,
and who, lie so devoutly prays, (perhaps for
the very frfl lime) may be long preserved
for the government, the happitiffs' and pros
perity of our common country, was one Q?
that very executive ; or at aov rate, one of
those officers of government, woo it ii ftfTerU
ed in the letter to Mazzei, are opposed ta
the republicans, la. all 'the principal body of
our citizeru, our proprietors of lands, and aU
this mighty ma/s of uijn of talents.
And I will here a (It, why Mr. - Jefferfon.

to rally round the ftandardof CommnnSenfe,"
if he did not conceive they had. deviated

From a London Paper of July T2.
The Lite Right Hon. EDMUND BURKE.
Of Mr. Burke's talents and acquire
ments in general, it is 11 ( leceflary to speak.
Tliay were long the glory of his country, j
and the admiration of Europe ; they might
have been (had it so Coiififted with the in- j
fcrutable counsels of Divine Providence)
the filiation of both. If not the most ac- ?
complllhed orator, yet the mott eloquent
man of his age, perhaps second to none in
any age ; he had still more vvifdom than Â°
eloquence.- He diligently collefted it from
the wife of all times ; but what he had so j
obtained, he enriched from th 6 vast treasury
cf his own observation ; and his intellects,
aftive, vigorous, comprehsnfive, trained in
the difcipliiie of true philosophy, to what
ever subject he applied it, penetrated at
once through the furface into the essential â¢
form of things.
With a fancy Angularly vivid, he, least
of all men in his times, indulged in splendid
theories. With more ample materials of
every kind than any of his coterhporarifes,
he Waj the last in his own {kill to innovate.
A statesman of the mod enlarged views,
in all his policy he was strictly pradical,
and in his practice he always regarded, with
holy reverence, the institutions and manners TÂ°
derived from our ancestors. It seemed as w '
if he had been endowed with such tran- Ull
fcendant powers, and informed with such ' CI
extensive knowledge, only to bear the more an
â¢striking tcrtimony in. these days of rash pre-
fumption,'how much the greatest mind is an
singly inferior to the accumulated efforts of 3 '
innumerable minds ia the long flow of cen- ty.
turL-j. cui
His private conversation had the fame cai
tinfture with his public eloquence. He K CI
sometimes adorned arfd dignified it with phi- lor
lofophy, but he never loft the charm of t ' lÂ£
natural ease. There was no fubjeft so tri-
vi'J which he did not tranfiontly illuminate l '
with the brilliancy of. his imagination. In : j' le
writing, in speaking, in the senate, or !' n ..
round the table, it eafy to trace the
operations of the fame genius. , j fÂ° v
To the Protestant religion, as by law n . ec
eftablilhed, he was attached from sincere
convidtion ; nor was his a barren belief, '
â¢vithout influence on his moral conduft. 1
He was rigid in the systems of duties'by
which he regulated his pwn aftiens; libe
ral in construing those of all other men;
warm but placable, resenting more the ?
offences committed against hose Nvho were [ ICC
dear to him, than against himfelf; vehe- ? s
Plent and indignant only where he thought ? N
public justice infultjd ; companionate to y
private distress ; lenient even to ifuffering P lOl
giy'lt. As a friend, he was perhaps too . 1
partial to those whom he esteemed ; over- f 10 ."
rating eve/y little merit, overlooking all
their defefts ; indefatigable in serving them ; '
straining in their favor whatever influence
he poffelTed ; and for thei'i fakes more than
for his own, regretting that during so long j
a political life he had so seldom borne any Â°
share in power, which he considered only as*
zii instrument of more diffufive good. In a
liis domestic relations he was worthy (and
more than worthy he could not be) of the
eminent felicity which for many years he
enjoyed ; an husband of exemplary tender
ness and fidelity ; a father fond to excess ; ,
the most affeftionate of brothers ; the kind- ?. ar .'
eft matter ; and on his part he has been 1
often heard to declare, that in the most no 1.
anxious mqments of his public life, every
care vanished when he entered his own roof.
One who long and intimately knew him, 'P re
to divert his o*n sorrow, has paid this very 1 ,
inadequate tribute to his memory. Nothing
which relates to such a man, can be unin- "P 1
terefting or uninftruftive to the public, to P
â¢whom he truly belonged. Few indeed
whom the Divine Goodness has largely
gifted, are capable of profiting by the imi

r s, Monday last, as a number of men from
tl, Newton were riding vÂ«ry faft home with
t }, their scythes, after mowing in the marsh, a
rs yÂ° un g man by the name of Wm. Noyes,
as was thrown from his horse ; his scythe fell
n _ under him, and made a wound iiv his left fide
.jj seven inches long, cut one of hi* ribs in two,
re and left a considerable opening his chest.
He was in extreme pain while he survived;
is anc ' within 24 Jie expired. He was
} f a strong, aftive, promising young man, near
-- [ y 2 3 years of age. It is hoped the qir-.
cumltance of his death will be a fufficient
e caution against riding faft with such a dan
e B erous weapon. It would be much fafer
i- *or those who find it convenient to carry
if thÂ«r scythes on horseback, to take them off
{. fromthefneads, and bind them up with them.

j | ADMIRALTY CAUSE.
| The following is t\ie decree of judge Bel
fcur of the admiralty court of the island
of Tobago, in the cafe of the schooner
Commerce, captured by the French, ar4 I
afterwards retaken by the English.,
Tobago, 15//J July, 1797. Â£
" I confidjr the cafe that was stated by
the council for the claimant as very strong, r
and it appears clear from the decision against
the ftiip St. Jago de la AÂ£ega, that the aÂ£k of j.
parliament relative to salvage merely refpefts 1
British fubjefts and tÃeir property, bat in !
no refpeft neutrals or aliens. q
The cafe stated from Grotius occasioned
graat doubts in my mind, whether the cap
ture by the French privateer did not make \
the vessel and cargo their property and con- j;
legal prize to the captora, as I did E
not think the court conld have any means
of legally coming at the cause of capture r.
by the French, or the consequences. j (
But it being notorious that war does not 1 1
exist between the republic of France and the r c
United States of America, I am inclined to
c6nfider the capture by the French privateer
as an aft ef piracy or an illegal capture, and &
I fed much gratified by finding it in my
power, under that idea, of giving a deeffion
that appears to me more, conformable to
justice and equity than I could otherwise
have done. By 2 7th Ed. 3 Cap. St the 13th
dodh. 163 it is laid down that if a pirate
takes goods on the sea and even fells them,
the property is not altered no more than if a [ n
thief on the land had ilolen and fold them.
By the lex Mercatoria 184,. when goods
were taken by a pirate and afterwards the
pirate making an attack upon another ship
is conquered and taken by the other, by
the law marine,the admiral may make refti-.
tution of the goods to the owners; if they
are fellow fubjefts of the captors, or belong
to any state in amity with his sovereign, on
paying the costs and charges and making
the captor an equitable consideration for his g Q
service. co|
I consider the capture of theCommerceby
the Cumanaters-aS piratical and illegal, and Â£ u
I therefore adjudge and determine that there
shall five per cenPwf the value of the schooner
Commerce and her cargo, valuing the fame
in gold and silver, be paid to the captor* in
lieu of all costs, charges and rewards whatr
ever.'âl further order, that in cafe the par
ties do not agfee as to the value of the
schooner and cargo that the fame be referred
to Messrs. King and Machan with liberty to
call in an umpire.

We are assured that the council of state has
determined in favour of the petition j so that
the departure of the French volunteer com

of land, the property of' gentlemen living in New
York, Philadelphia, London and Paris, for which
traAs of ltnd Urge fumsof money have been paid
to those fraudulent men, by innocent purchasers
It is therefore just that public information should
be. given, to the end, that the injured may seek re
dress while the men have property, and are to be
found. Those who have been difcovsred aire Tru
m3n Harrifon,. Joseph Witcomb, said now to rc
fidc in the county of Saratoga ; Thomas Kelly and
several otheri who go upder fiilitious names. It is
supposed that the lands offered fcr salÂ« on those fa
bricated titles, are at lead* worth fifty thousand
dollars. Such as we have adtual knowledge of are
as follows : Lots No. II and la, Otfega patent,
thousand acres each, the arflual property of William
Dellwjn, now of London ; lots No. 58 and 64,
fame patent, thousand acres each, the property of
Mr. Chaumont, now of Paris, and James Averill
and others, ot this State. There is some grounds
to suppose that the lands of Richard Wells and
Charles Wharton, of Philadelphia, are under their
management. âThe Printers will do well to give
this a place in their papers, as well to caution the
public against purchasing those lands, as also to de
prive those men in future from imposing on indivi
dufifs, which their education and address have en
abled them tÂ«do heretofore. Witcomb has been
a IhopkeepeV of some note in this eountry.
The following affidavits will fct in a clear point
of view the wickedness of those men, which when
the public have pernfed, Will indues them to ex
tufe the interference of Wm. COOPER.
Otfego, July aÃth, 1797.
1 Thomas Kelly, of the County of Otfego, hav
ing been led into an error, by John Witcomb and
Truman Harrifon, of the fame County, to sign a
deed to them, for lot NOl 58, Otfego patent, whieh
was the property of William T. Franklin now Mr.
Chamont's aud others ; and further the said Joseph
and Truman did persuade me to do this against my
inclination, which was made out on the icth day
of November, 1793, or fÂ«t back two years so as
to bring it to that time ; and further the naim ps
Pardon Starks to that deed was a fiAitious namo,
there being no such perlon there. To this I make
voluntary oath. THOMAS KELLY.

madeapplicationfcVeral times for the fame purpoie,

the United States of America, htreby #ivÂ«s notice that
he has opened his office at his houjc the south east

where he Is ready to receive all claims or inliruftions
for claims with the vouehtrs aud documents thereof,
for the purpose of bringing forward the fame agrec~
ably so the rules and orders whicbthe board may
think proper to prefenbe*
And as it will be foe the interest of all â¬o*Â«Â«riied,
that the fcveral claims be so itattd, and support
ed, as to prevent the delay which would arise from
the ncceflity of obtaining further information, or ad
ditional materials,from .periods reGdisg at a diitance,
the general agent thinks it his duty to add, (for the
direction chiefly of those, who, not having employ
ed particular agents, may leave the prosecution of
thrir claims to his charge and management) that all
such claims pught in particular to fci forthâ
tft. The proper defcripiion and fitnation of the
creditor or claimant, end original debtor, refpe&-
ively.
ad. The date andnature of the original contrast or
debt.
3d. When, .in what meaner, and to what extent,
the creditor or elaimant was prevented or impeded,
by the provi&on, operation or defetfc of law, the
decifionsand practice of courts, or restraint of exe
cution, from recovering payment of the debt in
qucft'ion.
4th. Tbelofsand damige incurred or sustained,
in consequence of such impediments, whether the
fame may have arisen from the infolveney, change ot
or death o< ths debtor, the loss of legal
remedy from lapse of time, or othercaufes impairing
the value and feeurityof the debt, which would not
have so operated ii such impediments had notexiflcd.
And sth. The particular grounds sod reasons on
which the claimant maintains, in the terms of the
treaty, that " by the ordinary course of judicial pro
ings, the creditor cannot now obtain and actually
have and receive suM and adequate eompenfation" for
the losses and damages so fuftaiucd.
The general agent thinks it his duty further to fug
ged that the fcveral claims ought to be accompanied
and supported by the affidavits of the claimants duly
sworn and regularly attellcd, both as to the exiftencs
of the debts claimed, and such other circumfUnccs
as may be within ihcir own knowledge refpeftively.
And wherever the claimants in Rating the nature of
