y PropofaU by WILLIAM COBBETT, opposite Christ

to be entitled _
; Porcupine's Gazette, Ess Daily Advertiser.
t Meihinks 1 hear the reader exclaim ; " What! have
e we hot Gazettes enough already Yes, and far tÂ»o
many: but thofc thnt we have< are, in general, con
e duflti in such a m.waer that their great number, in
-Uead if rendering mine unneceflary, it the only cause
that cdls fur its eftablilbmen:.
The gazettes 111 this couatry haw done.it more re.ll io
;- jury tiian all its open enemies ever did or can do. They
mi lie ad the people at home and misrepresent them a
r. broad, It was these vehicles of sedition and difcoi'd
that encouraged the counties in the Weft to rebel ; it
was tiey that gave rife to the depredations of Britain,
by exciting the people to such adts of. violence againll
that nation, as left no room to deubt that we were d -
termis J on war ; and it was they, when an accom
modation had been happily efkfled, that stirred Hp an
oppoHtion to it such as has seldom been wim tiled, and
whictrwas overcome by mere chance. These gazettes
- it was, that, by misrepresenting the dispositions of the
peoplt, encouraged the* French to proteed from one
degree of infsleuce to another, 'till at last their Minis
ter- braves the President in his chair, and a bullying
Â£ commander comes and ufls us that his only business is
to seize our velTcls, in violation of a treaty, in virtue
. ot which alone lie claims a right to enter our ports: and
it .0 the e gazette* that now have the impudence to e
-1 tena what their lalfehood and malice have produced.
1 lhall be told that the people are to blame; that
they are not obliged to read these abominable publica
tions. Bst they do read them; and thousands who
read them, read nothing else. To lupprefsthem is lm
poifiUle ; th;y will vomit forth their poison j it is a prU
vilege of the;r natures, that no law can abridge ; and
thersiare theonly mode left is, to counten<sl its effects.
1 his mull be done, too, in their own way. Books,
or periodical publications in the form of books, may
be of foms service, but are by no means a match for
their flying fplios. A fallebood that remains uncontra
dicted for a month, begins to be looked upon as a truth,
. and when the cleteiSion at laA makes its appearance, it
is often as ufeiefi as that of the doÂ£lor who finds his
patient expired. The only method of opposition, then,
â  is to ra;Â«i them their own ground ;to set foot to
I foot; dispute every inch and every hair's breadth;
fight them at their own weapons, and return them two
blows for one - "
A gazette of this Jsmn is what I have long wilhed to
fee, but I have wiihed and sxpsisied it in vain. Indig-
I nation at the fupinenefs of others has at last got the
better of ail diffidence in my own capacity, and has dc
, ' termined me to encounter the taflc People have heard
, one fide long enough ; they (hall now hear the other.

CONGRESS OF res UNITED STATES.
i
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
Wednesday, January lÃ>âContinued.
A call for the question aud for the committee to
rife was made.
Mr. W. Smith wished to fay a few words before
the question was taken. He said the discussion bad
turned upon points not before tlie committee, viz.
the quantity of revenue wanted, which would be
determined, if the principle was agreed upon when
the bill (hould be brought in, in filling up the
blank*, as would also the modification of the busi
ness. The only questions before them were, was
revenue wan'ed ? And whether, if wanted, direst
or indireffc fourcet should be applied to for the
money ?
All, except one gentleman who had fpokea up
on the fubjeA, acknowledged revenue tÂ» be want
ed. With refpeft to the mode by which it (hould
be raised, gentlemen opposed to direÂ£ taxes, had
laid before them a number of fuggeftpns ; but the
resolution of his colleague (Mr. Ha per) was the
' only plan which was regularly befÂ»re> them ; he
(hould therefore not notice any othet; as gentlemeÃ
. who were serious in any of their fufgeftions ought
to bring them regularly before th( committee.
With refpeA to the propofitionof his colleague,
it rcight perhaps be pofiible to raise some little
fiom an advance of duty on the articles he had
mentioned ; but the only thing if confeqsence in
his lift was fait, against taxing which the opposi
tion seemed to be pretty geneal. With refpeft
to a duty on stamps, he did notbelieve that would
' be a measure which would mce with the approba
tion of the committee, and the window tax was
I only a land-tax in another forra, vastly more ob
l jeftianable than the prQpofition before them. With
refpeft to imports, he said, thej were at present,
â¢n an average, 16 per-cent. He believad that
would be thought fufficiently high. Indeed he had
been informed that ihe duty on some artiples was
already to high, that it would be neceffiry to re
duce it, in order to prevent their being fmiggled ;
so that what might be raised by impost oilone ar
ticle, would only go to br.frnce what might be
taken off from another, and therefore to addi
tional revenue could be expedted from that faurce,
Mr. S. said hp (hould mention a cirejmftauce
which he had from good authority, which would
prove that the present duty was not paid With that
facility which they had heard of, viz. that in one
city only of the United States, three hundrtd writs
. had been iffiied againj merchants, for the reeevtry of
; their bmded debts ! 1
If this was a fact, and he could not doukt it, he
- did not think this was a proper time to incrtafe the
duty on imposts. With refpedt to direCk taxes, he
! was a little surprised to hear the opposition which
had been raised to them, ffnee in every state, except
: two, a plan of this kind was adopted; how the
idea of a direst tax being an impracticable njeafare
' came to be thrown oÂ»t, he could not imagine. He
was sorry it had been mentioned, since it might
[ have an effedt to weaken the confidence in govern
ment. With refpeft to what had been saM on the
. fuhjeft of modification, that would be matter for
future consideration. The only queitions were
: (what he had already stated) was revenue wanted ?
1 If it was whether they were ready to adopt the plan
proposed by his colleague, or agree to a direst tax ?
He hoped, therefore, they should then come to
. decifton upon the question.
r The calls for the question, and the committee to
- rife, were again repeated.
Mr. Harper said he felt no apology neceflary for
again troubling the committee with a few remarks;
but he promised they (hould be >s few as possible.
He thoHght it neceflary to make a few in reply
to certain things which had been- advanced agaiait
> the piopofuion which he had laid upon the table.
* It was said that they were not able at present to
make an aecmate judgment upon the fubjc-&. He
. thought they were. Some parts of his plan, he
â¢ said, had been placed in a l'ght by no means con
. sonant with the truth of the cafe. It was neceffa
ry, therefore, to correct some falfe views which had
been given of the fubjeft, and place them in their
1 true light.
A member from Pennsylvania (Mr. Gallatin)
yesterday stated, that all the calculations which he
. had made on the fubjedt of irapofts, were wholly
i impcrfcdt and vain, becaufethey were, made on du
ties receivable, instead of received at the custom.
' house, and that the amount of duties received was
very far below his estimate. But the gentleman
, 9Ug;ht to have recolle&ed that those eftima'es were
not calculated upon any one year, but upon (he
, average produce of several years, tonfrquently
though the amount in one year might be less, the
average would be the fame, and the truth of his po
. fiticnthat the duties were would remain
unafFefted. Whether the amount of the r-reipts
was eight or five millions it made ns difference as
to his petition.
If the drawback, he said, Veere taken for anyone
year, it would be erroneous, as the dedudtiuns for
1795, went to the year 1796, and f 0 o<? ; "but
when the average on several years wai taken, it
would be found right.
He had asserted that his flatem:nts would not
be greatly aftedted by either war or peace ; nor did
he believe they would to any couuderabl! extent.
But the gentleman from PenofylvaniÂ» had predict
ed a very great defalcation of the revenue in cafe of
peace. He did not think it would be equal to the
incrcife of population which would he likely to take
place in consequence of such an event. It was
laid, that when a peace (hould take place, a g; eat
part of our cairying trade wonld be withdrawn, and
less capital would be employed ; but he a(ked if
that capita! would remain unemployed ? No ; agri
culture. perhaps manufiautes, roads, internal im
provements m!j<ht employ that capital.' And he
did not know but this would be a more profitable
employment of it, than in foreign commerce. He
believed that commerce had been over done, and
that wealth employed in that way might be more
profitably employed on othtv abjefts. fciftead of
being spread spoil the ocean, if it were spread upon
laed, he behtved it would turn to better account.

N.
In of war, an pven? which thev ought _al- v
ways to look upou as poffiblt, it was fa;u the t al
cattop would be great. This, he did not beheve.
He deprecated war as the great eft of evils, and he
hoped and trusted it would be very long before t.:it
country was involved in such a calamity. e_''Â°P
ed the events predifled by the gentleman from Penn
sylvania (Mr. Gallatin) would soon bless our fight ; ;
but though he believed war to be so great an evil,
yet he did not think our revenues would be greatly (
injured by it. In order to fee this, it might be ob- Â£
served, if our trade was a foreign trade, like that
carried on by the Dutch or English, it would de- I
pend upon a, state of peace. Those nations, in or-
der to defend their aommerce were obliged to keep
up large navy fcftablifhments (perhaps at a greatei
expence than all the benefits deiived from fueh a
commeree would warrant ;) but our commerce,
said he, depends upon, an exchange of the neccffa
ries of life with which we abound, for the fuperflu
oos labour ot other countiies. It was therefore the
interest of those countries to keep up this com
merce; they dtpended upon it for bread to eat.
Therefore, even in a state of war, they were under
the neceflity of winking at a commerce upon which
their very existence almost depended. In the lail
war, perhaps there was as great an amount 01 duty
paid as at present, in proportion to the population
of the country. Therefore, however great the e
vil us a *ar might be, it would not he said, destroy
our commerce. And with refpett to the plunder
of our property by (hips of war of different coun
tries, it could not be greater than it had been.
It had been said that the objections to a land-tax
were equally strong against a window tax, a tax on
stills, or other t;.xes of that kind, but this \r?s a
mistake. The differeqee was, that, in, one cafe,
they were apportioned by government upan the
people, and in the other the peoplechofe themselves
what part of them they wauld pay. And even ;
.idmitting (which he did not believe) that money
was as plentiful in the country as in cities, (till this 1
objection would lie against diteft taxes.
It had been said thai tttÂ£ impost duties could not
be raised : but no proof had been brought of this.
His colleague had indeed adduced a fait which lie
meant as proof, that ir one town 300 writs had
been iffucd for duty. Bu: this did not prove that
the duty was too high ; but that the merchants had
all of them over-traded their capitals, of which they
had had proofs enough already. If the duty bad
1 only been one half the present amount, the fame
thir g mi a ht have happened.
Mr. H then adverted to his plan, and defended
r it against the objections which had been uiged a
s gainst it. He observed that much had been said on
the fubjeft of smuggling. They should adveit, he
â  said, to the difference of situation betwixt this and
: foreign countries. What was the situation of Hol
: land, Spain and Great-Britain, in this refprft ?
t They were divided from, each other by rivers, or
narrow fe;>i which might be crossed in an open boat
: which would carry over 30,0001. worth of dutiable
: goods in a few hours. Ou-arhis account smuggling
: was carried to a great extent ; but in this country,,
t he said, the Atlantic mult be crossed, or a
. pan of it, before an article could befmuggled.
; ' r He concluded with fayinjr, that if there were no
r other fourte but a land lax to supply the deficient
; revenue, he would vote for it ; but he believed a
? tax on windows or hearths, with the additions he
i had propoled to the would be far prefera
? ble, he should theieforc be opposed to the present
> question.
The committee rose, and the house adjourned.
) Thurfdav, January 19.
A letter was received from the Secretary of the
r Tieafury, im h.fing the report of the Secretary of
; War on the fuujeft of the naval eftabliftiment, and
. an eftiraate icfpedting the ports and harbours of
i the United States. What related to the naval ef
t tabliftiment was referred to acommittee on that sub
. jea, and what refpeacd the ports and harbours,
> >vas referred to a committee appointed to take the
; state of those into consideration.
; Mr. Venable from ths committee of eleftionj,
. made a report, viz. that Mr. Dana from Connecti
cut was entitled to hisfeat ; and that they had prÂ»-
1 ceeied to examine the complaints made against the
r undue eleaion of Mr. Varnum, from the second
Middle Diftria of Maffachufctts ; that no one of
| the petitioners, or their agents, had apptared this
feffisn to prosecute tieir complaint*, nor transmit
ted any evidence on the fubjcCt ; that the fitting
member had produced evidence that the eleaion in 1
the town of Dracut, (the unfairnefs of which
had hfen complained of) was conduced with'fair
nefs and propriety ; and though there had been
fame trregulaiities committed in other places, they
were mostly owing to the mifconduft of the petiti
oners ; the committee, therefore, report it as their
opinion, that Joseph Bradley Vamum,is duly elec
ted, and that any attempt to deprive him of his feat,
appeared to be more the effea of malice, than of
any real ground of complaint against the faimefs
of his eleaion. Ordered to lie on the fab!#.
Mr. Dwight Foster, from the committee of
claims, made reports on the petitions of William
Ciaik, Peter Lee, Catliff Ntfier, and John Steven

motion of Mr. Livingfton, who hoped some steps
would be taken to rclifve these fufferers, it was or

Parliament-Street, November 29, 1796.
A dispatch from the Governor and Council of
Madras, dated Fort St. George, June 21, I79^>
which the following is a copy, hÂ»s been
the conrt of Dire&ors of the Ealt India Company,
and by them communicated to the Rigrtt Hon.
Heury Dundas, one ofhiÂ» Majelly's principal Sec
v retarics of State. v
Honorable Sirs, _
We have particular fatisfa&ion in offering to you
our Sincere congratulations on the complete success
which has attended the operations of Rear Admiral
Rainier in the Eastern Seas ; and judging that an c
early communcation of this event might be of mate
rial use to his Majesty's Ministers, we have deter- c
mined to forward this letter by the route of Buffo- 1
rah. ,
It appears by .the Rear Admiral's dispatches, da
ted the 27th of March and llth April last, and 1
which reached us on the 18th inft. by the .Orphe
us frigate, that the Britifli troops are in possession (
Â®f the islands of Amboyna'and Banda, with their j
fevered dependencies, compriling, as it was thought,
the wheleWof the Dutch islands, excepting Forna.i- '
te, yielding cloves, nutmegs, and maceâThis ac- H
quilition has been attained without the smallest loss
on our lide.
Amboyna and its dependencies were delivered up
on the 19th February, and Banda and its dependen
cies on the Bth of March. Copies of the Capitula
tion are inclosed.
The Admiral speaks in the handfomelt manner
of the a&ivity and alacrity with which every duty
was performed by the forces under his command,
both naval and military ; and dwells particularly
* on the perteft harmony which all along fubfilled be
tween the officers and men in both services. It be
hoves us on this occaflon to convey to you the high !
sense we entertain of the able and spirited coi,du<ft 1
dijplayed by Rear Admiral Rainier, whose hearty co
opefation with us in every measure conducive to the
public weal demands our warmell acknowledgements,
and whillt we feel allured of your entire approbation
of all the means employed by this Government, to
give effect to the arrangement! frarawJ by his Ma
jesty's Ministers for, securing the Dutch fetttleme&tS
ia India, it is ueverthelefs, incumbent upon its
to declare, that the accomplishment of this great ob
ject has been chiefly obtained by the zealous and
cbeaiTul support which we have had the good for
tune to experience from the Officers entrusted with
the execution of it.
We (hall do ourselves the honor of transmitting,
by the firll sea conveyance, copies of all the papers
received from the Admiial which will enable you
to ferm an agcurate opinion of the value of those
islands. At present we can only give you a sum
mary of his proceedings. ,
1 he Admiral found in the Treasury at
na 81,112 rix dollars, end in ffore 515.94.0 pounds
weight of ctoves ; and in the Trealury at Banda
66,675 rix dollars, and in (lore 84,777 pounds of
nutmegs, pounds of tnace, besides merchan
dize and other (teres at each place, upon which no
value had been then put.
We are preparing to fend a reinforcement of
troops for the hetter proteftiori of those valuable
islands; and, as the Admiral lias advised us that he
is flioit cf provisions, and in want of a fupplj' of
naval and military stores it isosr intention to form
an adequate Hock of evety iieceffary article.
We have great pk-afure in acquainting you, that
the company's possessions on this eoaft are in a ftatt
of perfect tranquility ; and that we have no reason
. Vto believe that any defigus are in agitation by the
native powers hoftile N to yonr intercfls.
We have the honor to be, scc.

F
| On Wednesday, the Vice-PreGd nt, in a very affec
tionatt address, took It ave ol the Senate of the Unit- Q
r- ed States, and resigned the Chair. He was very much Â£(
:h affeiled on the occasion ; and the emotion of the Sen
ate wis not less visible. i
T Yelterday, the Senate proceeded, to the choice of a a
Prelident to supply the place ; when the Hon. Willi- f'
am Bingham was eleiSed.
,u A Cnmm ttee of the Senate was then appointed to
f e draft an answer to the Address of the Vice President.

as his conduit during the period he has prelided over

Mr. Ffnno,
IT is an alarming trlith, that For want t>f a Bank- ,
rupt law in this State, the grofleft impositions and 1
at frauds are now pra&ifed. A considerable number of
te oÂ»t trariing peoplej who find it difficult to make good L '
an their engagements, aflign over to their friends or re!Â»- 1
| ie tinns, the efieiSts Â«f others, of which they become pof
ft/Ted, and leave their just creditors without any satis- ']
fa-ition, except their persons, which sometimes are j
committed ta gaol, but liberated in the course of a few â ,
weeks and they often come out in wealthier circurn
flances than if no embarraflinent had happened to their
affairs. Thii evil is daily encreafing, and nnlefs it be I
ipeedily checked by proper Bankrupt laws, there will I

x- There is no truism better eftabliffied either in r
morals or politics, than that the weak are fubjeft I
in to be opprÂ«ffed by the strong. It holds good from C
the brnte creation to man, and is equally applicable
to nations as to individuals. A small power conti
guous to a large one, presents itfelf as an object a
of national avidity ; and if it escape being annex- t
ed as an appendage to its neighbours, or incorpora I,
ted and 101 lin the common mass, it is often com- r
pelted to pay dear for its independence, and must a
fobmit to all the arbitrary exactions they choole to a
impose. It is fit also wiih commercial nations def- f
tituie of a naval force to protcft its tradeâof this fc
v the Uuited States are at present verifying the truth, p
g As our revenue is principally derived from du- 1
f- ties on imports, it is obvious that the one encrea- c
j fes or diminishes with the other ; and therefore it
is oifr interest to guard as much as possible against (
s', the causes of defalcation. c
i- If our present revenues are inadequate to sup- t
h port the ordinary charges of government, and main- t
1- tain a naval force equal to protection, let us recur 1
It to other means- t
ir It is perfectly clear, that the Agricultural and t
commercial intcreits aie reciprocally iufluential and <
I 1 v "Â» â 
*
dependent on each other. Ifone fails, the other
languishes. If our commerce is cut uu, pro uce
mutt tall. The truth of this is beginning' to be
felt, and will probably be felt (till more. The lofies
fuftaineti by our merchants render them cautious. w
Fewer vessels are sent to the Weft Indies,the great d
market for meals, beef, pork, and other valuable j r<
articles of produce. Hence the demand lelf.ns, |
and prices lower. This is an appeal tÂ» the farmer, jci
of which he mtift neceflarily be sensible, and evinces Â«i
the policy of (Ã¼bmittmg to be taxed. If a light . g
tax were laid on our lands, it would be a sure and j ai
' productive sauce of' revenue, not dependent on
contingencies, nÂ»r the caprice or injustice of Fo
reign powers
With fortleaid from that quarter, and others yet
unexplored, a revenue might be raised fuScient to I
build and maintain a Navy, equal, at least to defen- J
five pronation.
Our distance from Europe precludes all â  appre
henlion of dinger from inyafion ; hence there is
no N neceffity of supporting a land force, as every k
Europe in powe\ is unhappily obliged to do. Our â¢
only charge wo\Jd be the fleet ; and as thts would a
not require to sot Defence, it would not It
becamt burden il
To this intereftiig objefl our eyes fhotild, from b
this moment, be iiceflantly turned. The circum- t
(lances and politionof the United States fh.-w them e
to be calculated for j mod extensive commerce with o
the whale world. Our true policy will alwavs be
peace ; and to fuppert that system refptJibly, we r
mull possess a Navy. t
Provided as we night and should be, on the k
Ocean, if a war breakout between France awd Eng- c
land, or any of the Rjropean powers with which
we have mod extenfire commercial relations, we
might announce out drtettnination to he neutral,
and at the fame time Htclare, that Â»s we wilhed to r
eostinue out commetcepeaceahly with all, we would 1
nvtfnbmit to be treated with difrefpeft, nor plun- \
dered with impunity, by any. That we Ihonld, 1
when neceflary, oonvoy our merchantmen and repel 1
every aggreflor. That if individual depredations a
occurred, we would demand reparation ; and if we (
experienced delay ortefulal exercise the right which j
i nations are permitted to ex it, of making repri- i
I sals. That this should not exceed the amount of i
our loflesas far as they could be ascertained, but I
that we vou)d in every cafe proceed thus far. , 1
An early declatation of this furt iuppotted by
an abilityto carry it into effect, would deter others
from comtrtitting wanton a&s ot barbarity or pitacy
upon us ; for the conduct of Britain lately, and I
Frante at present, merits no fofler tit]eÂ«.
This fubjeft is a serious one, and alarms the cun- 1
fideraiian oi every American def>i*us of feeing his i
country fotirifh. Our ft uatton is fuch'that we
may profit by doing good to others in diitieis, and
not to improve our advantages, is little better than
: folly. . [iV. r. D. Gmz ]

38 Dear Sir,
I fhould'.hive written you last week, had I then been
>0 able to ascertain certain fails, the rumour of which I had
~ heard. A Mrs. Beers, a near neighbour to me, the wife
of Eben Beers, and daughter of captain Samuel Hnggins,
of this town, had been, for fourteen weeks, exceedingly
30 diftreiled with the Rheumatil'm, to such a degree that for 1
is fourtee " weeks previous to the 19th of last month, die
(e had not been able to walk across the room'even with crut- xt
ches, faveoniy once, when she made out with the affift
d anee of crutches to hobble part of the way acrois her room. J
n. On the 19th of September last, she procured a set of your
,j, metallic substances, and in less than an hour after she had S '
/i begun to use them, in the manner directed by you, she ,
' rofc from her chair, and walked about her house, and on â.
'â¢ the next day Ihe went abroad to her neighbours, having f
thrown afidc her crutches. I have this day paid her a vifi^
in company with her father, and Timothy Jones, Esq. 1
ie who lives in the street where ffie resides and diredtly op- #r '
'â  pofit< to her residence, and with Capt. Abel Burrett, who
s . is her nex*. neighbor, and lives witliin eight yards of her
'' door. I requested her to relate her cafe over in their
presence, which she did, and these gentlemen all with one r
voice, supported, from their own knowledge, her flory. â¢ ?'

a This may certify, that the fubferiber, in his visits among 1
n his people, has used Dr. Perkins's metallic points, to re
lieve pains and inflammations of various kinds, and has
r succeeded to his astonishment. They have seldom failed m Â° l
'' to relieve the heai-ach, teethrach, ague in the face, in
Â® flammation in the eyes, cramp, cholic, rlieiimatifm, pains
of the breast and fide, biles, fcaldsand burnsâSometimes J' nu
there has been a perfeit cure from one operation. A lad J
r who had been coufmcd three days with high symptoms of
. a fever, very hot and full of pain, by an operation of the
points, designed to relieve his head, his facc turned pale
' and cold, his fever and pain immediately left him, and in
' a few days he was out of doors ; the year before, at the
. farae season. We was taken with the fame symptoms, and T N
1 lay extremely sick forty days. The efficacy of the metal- A 1
lie points has gained great credit in this town. t ' le
