AS your paper is conlidered all thro' America at
a found federal paper, and the rallying point of the
friends of thcconllitution and of good government,
your subscribers must view with pain any attempts
by the concealed enemies of both constitution and
'â¢ good government, to injure its circulation, bjr ma
king it a vehicle of publications, difjufting to all
good federalifts. ' There are unfortunately papers
enough already, well disposed and Â«ager to diffemi-
Phi- naie pernicious sentiments and to poison the public
mind }in God's name, ,let the good federalifts have
one paper, free from disorganizing do&rines, let
! j < them have one repository for the fupportersof good
government. These sentiments have been drawn
forth by feeing a great many columns of your tru
â fe it 'y valuable paper Huffed, at this interedisg crisis of
our affairs, with calumnies against that virtuous pa
e 'p I triot, jfthn /Mams, by a writer, disguising himfelf
lcr '" j under the name of a federalijl, in order to excite
â¢'ad I ittcn, ' on among your readers, a trick, proceeding

eadjr I not merit.it. â¢ 1 1

res- j Wfjpt right have they to poach on federal ground ? I

\in disguise, who is wire-drawing long, fophiilrcated 1

PHOCIONâNo. XXIV.
ipy ABOUT the beginning Â«f the year 1791, the f
its' house of representatives of the United States, re- lr
ferred !o the secretary of (late, a representation of w
I legiflatureof Malfachufetts on the (lecayt*tl [late u
0 f Â®f the cod and tuhale JjJhenes. The object of the
reference was to eaufe an enquiry into the real (late ?
of the fifteriw, and to revive from the secretary, "
some plan of legislative aid. The representation . (
complained " that the fidieries laboured under ma- K '
ny and heavy embarraffmen's, which, if not remo- a . r
S ved or lessened, would render thrm every year lass
it- extensive and important, that these embarraflments
I weie, heavy duties on their produce abtoad, and
ilt bounties on that of their competitors, and duties at *Â»'
home on several articles, particularly used in the fifli- tC ,
j etics, and it asked* that those duties might be taken T
I off, that bounties might be given to the filhermen, .
apt and the national influtnee liftd abroad for â¢btaining
I letter markets for their produce." "
j Ihe course to be pursued by the secretary was
plain and simpleâto inquire into the truth of the , C
I representation, and if tiue, to report some system of .' e
Initiative aid, either by taking off the duties, or y
j g' v '"g bounties, or using the influence of the go
j vernment with foreign nations, to procure better
I markets, or all of these measures. dij

' in truth, in was, at Jeaft, as likely to be durable,
' o as the tenure by which, from his own account, we*

a . Growing (till warmer on his favorite topic, lie
er adds, " Nor can it be announced, that there it my

Howevef reluctant thc secretary had been to give
|, ( any positive advice to congress, refpeds'ig the t{-
)e feutial aid which the cod-fifhery required, content- '
j,, ine himfelf with leaving that to their wisdom ; vet,
as here, his zeal for counter regulations againfl Great
re Britain, overcomes his diffidence, and lie plainly and
pointedly advises decisive and important measures.
f e Though evidently indifferent about Ihe prnfperity
ft or distress of the fifiiermcn, yet he is ready tofeize
on the intereftsand paflionsof the New Englardeu,
and embody them-on his fide, against thfir fappof
ed enemy, Great-Britain. But these prudent peo
i. p' e > too wile to be caught in such a snare, and too
| e well acquainted with the true interests of their
e country, were almofl unanimouHy opposed to Mr.
[, Jefferfon's plan of counter-regulations, which he
afterwards more fully developed, when cirtumftan
e cc Â® prf-mifed a more fuccefsful refnlt. It wa-i not a
' Jt little surprising that he he (hould, thus early, Jiave
n complained of the disinclination of Great Brilain .
n to meet us in comm.'rcial arrangements. Mr
ferfon had not been many months in office under
the new government, which was then but in its in
.. fancy, and it was known that Great-Britain was
e about to fend a this country, who in
g deed arrived here within a few months after this
complaint.
Anxious as was the secretary, thus early, to sow
the feeds of commercial hostility againlt Great
t Britain, some fails incautioufiy escaped from hi*
pen, in this leport, of so unfavourable a complec
e tion tÂ» France, he took special care, in his
. commercial report, to pass them by in silence, tho'
. they were full as relevant t* the fuhjeCl, as ihofe
n be then detailed refpefting the rival nation. Thus,
jn page 5, he fays, " the navigation of France, from
. being the most economical, was become the mofex
- penjivt of ar,y nation." This is the navigation, in
1 favour of which, he recommends in his commercial
1 report, the excltifion of British vessels. In the
| fame page he tslls 01, that, though the filhcjits of
. 'be United States were annihilated during the war,
5 and their markers in the Mediterranean and Brit/11
. America lolt, yet their produce wis dutiedin thee
. Â°f France. In page 9, he tells us, that, at this ci:-
. ticlal time, when the filhermen of the United States,
t left without r?fource by the fofs of their markets,
; began to think of accepting an invitation from 0.
. Britain, and removing, fonee to Nova-Scoua, and
I others to England, the government of France, not
inattentive to these proceedings, endeavoured to
prevent this emigration of our filhermen, by pro
mising, that our friends in France Â«*jgu!d do fcace
thing f#r them ; but that, irftead of doing any
thing ro induce them to ilay in the United States,,
the government of France, injidioujly, and contrarylo the sfrtfltei and intenaon of the generous La Pay
ttte, Jeduced our fifhcrmea to go and fettle in Dun
kirk, by offering them a bounty of ten dollars a
ion on their veffcls, besides other advantages. In
page to, he tells us, that soon after this plan of
iiedudtion, France (hut her ports to all foreign fi(h
oilsâan exeluGon which falfied our Jifhery ; thai
they afterwards opened their ports to the produce
of our whale fiftierie,, continuing however their en
deavours to recover a (hare id this fifhery themselves,
by the aid of our JiJhermen, having then one hundred
and fifty American, on board the seventeen Frcnch
vessels employed in both fiftwries.
There is one furthet remark which prefentsitfelf
â¢n examining this report.âln dating the disadvan
tages which would attend our loss of the fifheries,
the secretary mentions, the injury to our naviga
iion, and the confeqtient dependence on the car
riage of other nations: "We (hould lose," fays he,
" during an European war, the cairiage for belli
gerent powers, which the neutrality of onr flag
would render an incalculable fourcc of profitand
yet, in this very report, he advises hostile measures
âyet, in his commercial report, he repeats this
advice with greater zeal, and in his general politi
cal conduct, he has been always promoting mea
sures, the unequivocal objeA of which was, to en
lifi us on the fide of France during the present war,
and thus compel us to relinquish the neutrality of
oar flag, this incalculable source of profit to the Uni
ted State,. PHOCION.

this . I' a ft evening arrived the (hip Fame, Capt. Harris, 1

LONDON, October 5. '
o p It was underwood on'change, that his majesty's ! '
Jni. sp eec h, as finally prepared in the cabinet yesterday, I
is extremely guarded, and holds out neither peace â¢ Â°
nor war, the consequence of which waa a fall of C
stocks. It was expected that the speech would at 1 c
lea ft hold out such a narrative of the at.cmptsj'
made by his majesty to commence a negociation as i 3
5. would have inspired confidence in the difpofitiors '
r j n â 'he court towards peace. If we may draw any '
argument fiom the isipreffion made in the alley lÂ»y J
the reports brought down yesterday afternoon, this
is by no means the cafe : the speech is to be smooth V
this and moffcnfiveâexadtly such a speech as Mr. Wil- V
berforae would make to the manufacturers of Leeds
âfufficiently consoling to flifie their petition for

itiih We yesterday received the Paris papers up to C
>as Friday last. the 7th inlt. incluiive. These papers '
are extrer. Â»> barren in point of intelligence from .
the aimies, which, however, our readers will find
detailed at length. The diredtory has publilhed an "
on- f'ffie' 3 ! declaration, that the difaltrnus retreat of
: in general Jourdan, not withstanding all the reports
that have been made by their enemies, has not coll Â°
>Â°rt the republic 6,000 men, comprehending killed, 1
â gÂ» wounded, deserters, prisoners and sick, and that
een h,s arm y.' lvhich has been reinforced from 16 to
laid '^i OOO }re, h troops is to resume an attitude which V '
irtt . (hall prove, that though the French may experi- R '
:wo eocea check, they can never be vanquilhed. The
we article adds, that the rumours which have been
m spread of a new requisition of men of a certain
ju- ? BC ' , t ' 11 " not, "ng can give the (lighted \
foundat,on to such a report, that on the contrary, r
lel , their successes, the losses of their enemies, the de- ,
feat of Wurmfer in Italy, the treaties of 1
peace already made this year, as well as those which ,
they have tl e well founded expectation yet to make 7
would render an y recruit of the armies not only 7
useless but hurtful. ' lu
Such is the account which the direftnry has I-''
thought it expedient to give to the republic. Our
readers will fubjeft it to the test Â»f probability, f
of ana comparing [t with the report of the German ,
e gazettes, and with the well known fact of the re- *7
*1- treat of the army of the Sambre and Meufe for so !
irnmcnfe a diltance, and of the nunnl er of battles f
they had to sustain, will judge of the truth or â
an falfhood of the ftatemrnt. In the mean time, all
t, that the Paris papers state of the adtual operations
;0 of thu army ferms to be taken from the Bruffcls a "
er gazette, by which it appears that some flight fkir-
P- milhrs have taken place, in which the French hn e r
a- had the advantage, and thst general Bournonville r 1
is occupied in restoring discipline to the dittoed r
a- body. icr
Prom the army of Moreau we have not been a- "r
3d ble to trace a single artielc in any of the French
journals, nor are there any farther accounts from C Â°,

The only important article which the French pa- fq '

ar We learn from good authority, that the governor
rcr hath this day determined not to iflue his proclama
| tion, relative to the ele&ion of eleflors, until Wed
ntl nefdayânot wit lift anding his honor had previously
ri( assured different gentlemen, at different" limey, that
n he would certainly promulge it in Brown's paper
te . this afternoon. We underitand, that the reason of
; n . this change of promise, arises from the opinions of
re . :h,? Shippen, Yeates, Smith and Biddle of
to this morning, " That the governor may by the laws
;fj delay it unto- that day." To enfurc the good will
of both parties, his honor declaied in the fulled
manner, his determination not to publish the pro
of clamation even then, if the express now fending off
th fort . hc ,e S al 'fturns of Northumberland and Ly.
av coming, should not be received by that day in or
a der, to use his honpr's own expredion, " that fair
