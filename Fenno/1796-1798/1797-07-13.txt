carrying into effe& the Cxth article of the
-L treitj of amity, commerce and navigation, con
cluded between hisÃritannic majesty and the United
States of America, en the 19th day of November,
1794Â» having this day constituted their Board,
pursuant and agreeably to the said treaty, do here
by give notice, that they are ready to proceed to
business accordingly; and they desire that all claim*
under the said article (which so far asthe fame de
scribes the cases thereby provided for, is hereunto
annexed) may be lodged with their Secretary with
out delay.
1 hey iurther- defirethat all such claims may npt
only Itate in what maiiLcr the fcyerai cases come
within the description of the said ?rtide, but also
specially fct forth v.he nature of the evidence by
which the claimants refpe&ivcly undertake tÂ®fub
ftantiate the fame.
Extra# from the said article,
" Whereas it is by divers Britilh raer
u chants, and others his majefty'a fubje&s, that !
" debts to a confide rable amount, which were bona
" qontra&ed, before the peace, still remain
" owing to them by citizen* or inhabitants, of the
United State* ; and that by the operatidp of va
" rious lawful impediments, since the peace, not
44 oi\ly the full rdebvery of the said debts has been
" delayed, but also the value and security thereof
" Have been in several inftanccs impaired and less
" ened, so that by the ordinary course of judicial
" proceedings, the Britilh creditor* cannot now
44 obtain and actually have and receive full and
44 ade<jua*e compensation for the lofles and dam;i
---" ges which tney have thereby fufiained; It is a
-4k greed that in all such cases where full compenfo- ]
" tion for such lofles and damages cannot for what- |
44 ever reason be a&ujlly obtained, had and recej- ,
44 ved by the said creditors in the Â©rdinapy courfo ,
44 of justice, the United States will make full and
44 complete compensation for the fame to the said (
44 creditors : but it is diftin&ly understood, that
44 this provision is to extend to such lofles only as J
44 h?ve been occasioned by the lawful impediments j
44 aforefaid, aud is not to extend to lofles occasion- j
44 ed by such insolvency of the debtors or other <
" causes, as would equally have operated to pro- ,
" duce such loss, if the said impediments had not ,
44 existed ; nor to such lofles or damages as have j
â¢â¢ been occasioned by the manifeft delay, or negli- (
'â¢ fcciicc, or wilful omiflion of the claimant.*'

r HE SUBSCRIBER having I fen appointed by
f the Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Pleni
potentiary of his Britannic Majesty, General Agent
loraflifting British creditors, and such particular a
gents as they may specially authorize, in protecuUQg
their claims before the cÂ«ramiflioiferÂ« for carrying in- <
ro effed the fixlh article of the Treaty of Amity, CoÂ«-
merce and Navigation between his Britannic Afajefly and
the United States of America, hereby Â£tves nocice that J
he has opened his office at his house the south eafl -
corner of Chefnut and fifth streets, Philadelphia, (
where he is ready to receive all claims or in&iuftions
for claims with the vouchers aud documents thereof,
lor the purpoie of bringing forward the fame agree*,
ably so the rules aud orders which the boatd may
think proper to prescribe.
Ana as it will be for the intercft of all concerned,
that the several claims be so Hated, and fupport
cd, as to prevent the delay which would arise from
the ncceflity of obtaining further information, or ad
ditional materials,from persons residing at a distance, r
the general agent thinks it his duty to add, (for the
direction chiefly of those, who, not having employ
ed particular agents, miy leave the prosecution of 1
their claims to his charge and management) that all c
such claims ought in particular to fei forthâ t
tft. The proper defeription and fitnation of ihe 1
creditor or claimant, end original debtor, refpeft
ively.
sd. The date andnature of the original contract or
debt.
3d. When, in what manner, and to what exteot,
the creditor or claimant was prevented or impeded,
by the provision, operation or defett of law, the
decisions and praflice of courts, or reftraintof exc- \
cation, from recovering payment of the debt in
question*
4th The loss and damage incurred or fufiained,
in consequence of such impediments, whether the
fame may have arisen from the infolveney, change of
fituatien, or death of the debtor, the loss of legal
remedy from lapse of time, or other causes impairing
the value and security of the debt, which would not
have so operated if such impediments had notexiAcd.
And sth. The particular grounds and reasons on
which the claimant maintains, in the terms of the.
treaty, that " by the ordinary course of judicial pnv
ings, the creditor cannot now obtain and aftuaWy
have and receive full and adequate compensation" fbr
the lofles and damages fofuftaiued.
The general agent thinks it his duty further to fug
gefl that the several claims ought to be accompanied
and supported by the affidavits of the claimants duly
(worn and regularly attested, both as to the exiflence
of the debts claimed, and such other circumstances
as may be within their own knowledge relpc&ively.
And wherever the claimants in Rating the nature of
their evidence (which mult in every instance be the
best of which the cafe is capable) have occasion
refer to the teftftnony of witnefles, it will be proper
to apprise the general agent of the names and places
of refidrnce of such witneflea and the faÂ£lÂ«to be efta- r
blifhed by their teflimony. k

MORGAN J. RHEES.
No. 177j South Sccond-ftreet, Philadelphia.
The purcJiaferg cf lots in Beula have the following
profpe&s of appreciating their property :
1. It is remote from any other town, and sur
rounded by great bodies of excellent land, capable
of producing every kind of grain and vegetables,
and is without doubt one ef thebeft grazing coun
tries is the United States.
1. In point of health the fituatipn is not exceed
ed by any on the continent;
3. Belides numerous springs and runs, of the fia
eft quality, there is a creÂ«k for water works (on
which mills are now building) running through the
town,
4 The public road from Philadelphia to Pittf
hurgh will go through it, whick "being more level
and nearer than any other rout, rauft become uni
versally travelled : aided by the navigation of Ju
niata and Conemaugh, goods may be conveyed at
lead a or 3 dollars per cwt. cheaper from the for
mer to the latter place, than by the old road thro 1
Bedford.
5. Ec irg in the centre of a ffourifhing settle
ment, and taking in the shortest portage between
theeaftern and western waters, it is likely to bc
<omea derofit for (lores, a manufa&uringtown,
and a feat of justice. Beside* the old feltlcTs, up
wards oi o;iÂ« hundred emigrants have fettled in the
vicinity of Beula, since last Oilober, and many
more have engaged to join them this summer.
â¢6. A Land-Qffice for supplying asUal settlers
with farms to a confideraWe amou:.t, and in vari
ous situations, will be immediately opened in the
town. The proprietors of land in the circumja
cent country ar& Elicited to fend their drafts and
terms Â©f sale, or leafing, to Thomas Jones, Sur
veyor, in Beula, who will give security for any
trust Ft pofcd in him : with such co-operating aid,
the progrefsof the settlement wiÂ«l be the n\oi e ra
pidly advanced arid extended to distant townships.
A public library for the benefit of the settlers,
will be cftablifhed in the town, towards laying the
foundation of which, upwards of one thousand
volumes are already purchased and principally feat
forward.
8. Two hundred acres of land adjoining the
town, bolides lots and fubferiptions, will be applied '*
to support a minister and preceptor, capable of
teaching the ufeful and liberal arts.
9. After defraying ncceffary expences, the mo
ney arifmg from the present be laid out in

[Volume XIIFrom ths Virginia Gazette.
To Samuel J. Cabellâin Congress.
Silt, r
I trove often heard of people's being Con
demned without judge or juryâbut I am.
lure you cannot fey U>is has been your cafe.
Your letters have been seen, read and fairly
v judged of bv all America ; and even your
best friends, and meanest relations have con
demned them. A court and jury you fay
have parted sentence upon theft). You, may
therefore, fairly be said to have been tried
by your peers. After all this, coramon
prudence ought tor ha\>e dictated to you to
have committed yourfelf no further : But
like one who has fuffered all the disgrace of
condemnation, a reprieve has been of no o
ther service to you, than to prepare you the
better for the prafectition of your favorite
pfaftice. We must, therefore, try you a
gain fpr this new offence of later borrowing.
I will not, however, make the charge of
bom-wing this last rag of knowledge from
the letter manufactory of Philadelphia, the
only charge against you, but will try the
thing on iii real merits as if it was actually
your own.
The charge then now turns upan a def
cantation on the duty of courts and juries,
and their rights to intermeddle with the free
dom and independence of your thoughts
Without a t(uibble, we may fairly try this
kit production, before any court and jury,
without intermeddling much, with the free
dom and indzpendehce of your thoughts, if the
gener.ii conjecture be true, of that independ
ence -confiding chiefly in the right of substi
tuting the thoughts atjd fentiment# of others
for your own. But,as you are the firft man
in /America who has had thehonorof object
ing to the trial by eburt and jury, I will
leave freedom and independence of your
borrowing ttie thoughts 'of others, which is
but a mere perfonil riling, to the true en
joyment, of these independent confederations,
and examine into your objections to 'the
court and jtiry mentioned in your address,
which indeed are of Tome confequerice to the
real liberties of this country.
Unfortunately for fonse of those who bow
down with the moil constant and loud pro
fcflions of love and admiration, to .the god
dess of liberty, they view the lovely medal
on but one fide only. They are friends to
the " liberty and independence of thought"
only while that liberty and independence of
thought consists in adopting the thoughts
of otlv.rs, and turning them particularly to
their use, this appears to be wholly the a
mount of your idea of the liberty and inde
penderice of thoughtâwhich you appear to
have borrowed, with many other excellent
things, from that favorite Republic, which
is now rambling all over the world with its
destructive armies, and compelling all the na
tions it can to be free âbut upon its otvn
terms.
One of the terms upon which they have
compelled some nations to be free, is, that
they subscribe to governments similar to
their own. One of the excellent traits of
their government, I believe at the time when
they set Holland free, and it is pretty much
thepraÂ£tice Hill, was the happy knack which
the demccrsts had of dispensing with the
little ceremonies and formalities of courts
and juries in the trial ofthe ari/locrais. Those
tribunals, might, perhaps have exercised 1
some liberty andindependence of thought,"
as well as the democrats, and thereby have
stopped the effufron of so much innocentâ
filch horrid sluices of infant and female
blood.
You fir, it is well Jcnown, have laboured
as far as your feeble efforts could effeft it,
to prevail on the people of this country to
. make no resistanceâor rather, to join those
"bloody monsters in cafe they should invade
your country ; and you have now fubferibed ,
your,name to another inflammatory address,
calculated to render the institution of courts
and juries unpopular, if it is calculated to |
do any thing, in order to make way for
those noble consequences which flowed '
from the want of them in France, whose (
principles you so much adore, and have thus
attempted to introduce here. ;
The Judges of the Federal Court you ar- (
raign for becoming abandofpolitical preach- -
tjrs (as you are pleased to call them) and go- j
ing about with unwarrantable sermons to
support the governmentofthe United States. '
This appears to be the substance of the
charge against them. Admitting it in its
fulleft latitude then, to what.does the charge
Theinfinuation goes to fhewthat
they have nothing to do with politics. In {
the name of common sense, what is theju- j
diciary, who are the judges of this country ? t
Are they not a branch of the American go
vernment, bound to fuppert that govern- J
ment, at well as evefy other branch of it, v
toth by the nature of their relationship with â 
the government and their oath ? What is
the government they are thus bound to sup
port, what the laws of that government,
which your adopted address seems to admit
is their duty to expound to do justice bet-
â¢ween individuals, if they are not a part of
the political-arrangements of this country ? j
HoW then arc the judges poflibly to avoid
political difcuflions, and giving their poli- r
tical opinions between the government and
individuals, and yet do their duty ?âSup- Q
pose the government, or rather a part ofthe f
government, wa6 to attempt to abridge you ;
in any of your rightsâFor inflance, to im- ,
pref3 you as a seaman, or pretend to enlist
yon as a soldier, to fight against the French,
would you not then think that the judiciary li
Ihoulil interfere ? And what would that interfe- v
rence be,- but one of the greatest political si
cueftions that could arise between an indivi- -
dual and a state ? Why not then, when the k
injury is attempted to be reversed from the I
individual to the state,' fuffer the judge to y
interpose a little political advice ? a
You (or rather the person who writes for o
you) seems to admit, that if you had done rr
any thing criminal, die judge was, right.â d
That is admitting, I suppose, that- a judge, fc
though he be a federal judge, has a right to tl
give it in charge to a jnry, is tacit--duty, to
present ail Monies, such as tiViibi, murder,
and all other capital o3lucc:;-â-but, tTyit
everything that falls Wo w tljs dainty of
any other punishment, but u bare prefent
-11 ment of a jury, is not cognizable in that
,U ' way. You (hould haye remembered, in the
j-' fr.ft place, .that yon were not the proper
judge of the degree of yoilrov.'n guilt. And
11 in the fecand place, it is a faÂ£t, Well knijwn
n " to ev'ery one who has ever been a juryman
} in any part of America, that there are cer
'a'll offences which cannot be punished in
a any other way, but by the censure of." na
ln ked prefentini nt." Adin tting it to be
it a J'^S e to enter into a
j- history of the rife and progress of juries,
which certainly cannot be told over too of
ten to the real lovcrsfif iioerty, and to enter
into an explanation of their dutr in tliepre
e | fentment of actual offences against the laws,
which are certainly a political grievance, I
â¢j. fee not how your letters, which had, been
' condemned as a political petty-larceny by
11 every hangman in the (late, were poflibly to
e escape.
c But, fir, admitting every thing that is
7 fald in that paper against the .judge to be
right, though in fad he had said nothing
about you, your letters,or any one else, in
'' his charge, how is what is there said of the
jury, to be reconciled to that love which you
pretend to have for the " freedom and in
s dependence of thought."
' The jury by whom that presentment was
| made, was compofcd of the free and inde
, pendent citizens of Virginia, who were as
much entitled4o think and aft for themselves
as any other citizens of Amiricaâthe mem
bers of Congrtfs themselves even not except
ed, UnlefsSt can be proved, then, that the
| jury was packed ( which you dare not aflert)
they are no more chargeable with having
a&ed wrong, for having exercised their
" freedom and independence of thougTit,"
than you youtfelf were entitled to prefer
' your oiun " freedom and independence (&
' j thought," to the borrowing of the genius
' o.f a Madifon'in the composition of the let
they presented. And whoever is acquaint!,
ed with the jury, and will look over the
pan,nel, as you have invited them, will as
clearly fee, that. there was no more of the
influence of an Iredell in the prefentiycnt,
there was the genius of a Madifou in
the letters. Here then- you and the jury
(land upon exaftly even ground with refpeft
to the " freedom and independence of
thought," which is the mighty and impor
tant burthen of this last political ditty.
But how do you stand in this last attempt,
with refpeft to the a&ual means of securing
the liberties and independence of your coun
try ?âJuries, although I believe we are in
debted to that wretched place, Great-Bri
tain, for their institution (and this is bne of
the reasons, perhaps, why you ha* the ex->
ercife of their power so- much) have ever
been considered the great palladium of A
merican, as well as Bntifh liberty. Which
do you really think would be best, then, for
the people to join you in yonr " INDIG
NATION" to awe those ufeful institutions
from the exercise of their " freedom and in
dependence of thought," or fuft'er them to
go on without reproach, as they think ne
cessary and right, to expose the follies of a
few little letter-writing politicians in Coin
grefs ?
It might indeed be a valuable thing to ,
those gentlemen no other means
of supporting their popularity, to establish
the doftrine of their conduit's being held
sacred and above inquiry, while in Congress.
But after an attempt to deft roy that which
ought always to be attached to c6urts and
juries, to make way for that kind of facred
nefs in the representative branch of the go
vernment, whit would the people have to
expect ? Could they be surprised to fee that
bran eh attempt to eredt itfelf into any thing,
which the fame love of popularity, that sug
gested the firft attempt might invite them 1
to in a more promising degree ? It is to the '
preservation of the independence of the ju- 1
diciary, I had always thought, that we were '
to look for the salvation of liberty. While !
you arc Handing as a ccntincl, then, over the 1
" freedom and independence of the valuable 1
thoughts" of MefTrs. Claiborne, Clopton, (
New, and yourfelf, I {hall stand a3 an hum- I
bleadvocate for the RIGHTS of JURIES, 1
and a constant' expofer of the many follies f
and improprieties which such writers are en- j
deavoring to impose on the people in their'
own favor.
For after all that has been said about the '
court and jury's " overawing the freedom of
thought," can there poflibly be a more a- 1
larming attempt, than for the members of e
the legislature to call up the terror of the 1
people, to overawe the courts and juries in }
their favor ? Really, lir, this last attempt, |
which cannot be repeated too often, dr (hewn J
in too many different shapes, if possible, ex- j
Ceeds the firft, in which you endeavored to
prevail on the people to join the French x
againjl themfel-ms. But, fortunately, both 1
attempts are equally absurd ; and the execu- J
tfon nothing more than a ridicule of the de
sign. Whenever I look into one of your J
letters as a mere matter of curiosity, as I 1
seldom do for any thing else, I feel an al- J
molt irrefiftable inclination to laugh. But
when I turn my refledliona from, that fourc<Â£ v
of merriment, to the diftrift you reprefent < 1 1
feel an involuntary,propenfity to weep. For r
if it be true, that there is a delign to increase '

From the Farmer's Weekly Mvfeum.
" When mill the new moan be gone that <we may
fell and the Sabbath that W( may fit
forth wheat."
IN th.e diffip&ted cit.ies of London and' Edin
burgh, the abufc of Sunday has been a common
theme of reproach among those weekly guardi
ans of the public virtue, the periodical elTaylfts.
Jehnfon, ahd Hawkfworth heard the turbulence
ot a riot and the roar of intoxication, from the
saloons and taverns of the capital ; but their
confidence in the innocence, or the piety of the
villager?, precludtd even the faint inquiry, whe
ther holy days were profaned by rufticS. Mor
aiifts might repair to the hamlet on * eek days,
and remark vice and folly ; but on the Sabbath,.
the young and the old, the careless and the re
gular, would be found no where, but in a
church,.
Though th# catholic spirit of the age of rea
fotjindulges tlie latitudinarian with an immunity
from Sabbath formalities, still it might be ima
gined there could be found, both in town and
country, men, who if they did not kneel at the '
altar, would lit decently and seriously at the
fire fide. Libertines might be averse to hear a j
sermon, or n Ake a response, yet not wish a Sun
day away, that they might let forth wheat, the !
bottle, or card table.
This, however,experience prove? a vain imo- !
gination. 'l'hefeventh day is observed by mul- 1
titudes, oeither as a season of worship nor reft. '
The country and the city are alike negligent, i
Orf Sunday, the hufbemjman often examines ]
hiicropt, the merchant computet his interest, the ]
rake urges his ft (red, and the attorneey draws his â¢
declaration. i
This impatience of a day* sacred to quiet and J
pietyÂ®, is an odd trait in the chara&er of those, I
who are saluted with the title of rational Man I
is such Â«n indolent, wo arc rot surprised that he <
dec lines tlv* excrcifes of Sunday, but that he \
loaths its reft. Of many loungers whom I
know, I have computed, with mathematical
precision, th e yawns on every Sunday and MÂ«n- 1
day, through the year- I .find that the aggre- '
gate lassitude ef the former to the latter is as. '
two (o one. ' t
The watch is fretfully consulted and its own
er queruloufiy atks, why tarry its wheels, -why -
does the dial point so tardily indicate the, twi
light hour ?
* Although th? custom of going to church is '
ancient, honorable, arid from fecial andpoliti- '
cat, as well as moral and religioui reafinns, laud- I
able ; yet, as my liberal scheme never excludes v
from the pale of charity, him, who prefers re- f
tired to cilenLatious devotions, lam desirous of
convincing the loiterer a; home on the Sabbath,
that there is no real'oÂ» for aholilhing, or abbre- 1
viating that tranquil day. It it belter to go up, [
with thelfraelites, to the temple ; but still a do- 1
mcftic Sunday may be ufeful and pious, if cor- '
re.lly improved; and if we do not ahfurdly, c
wist it away. The apodle prescribes " milk for ]
babes." The moralist good naturtdly al- c
lows some fqueamilh ones thejjidulgeace of at
vitiated rievational'tafte, and suggests a pleasant
and practicable regimen.
It must, hpwever,-be preremptorily required, <â 
that no immoral querist aflc when the Sabbath t
will be gone that he may fell core, set forth
wheat; or attend-to any low and fetular cares. n
If he flay from church, let him not grieÂ»e the o
Sunday. If he will not ting with the Organ, let â 
him not play on the violin.
That Sunday may dcleiftably pass, it is not ''
necefiary that coeks should fight, bowls be quaf- '
fed, or bargains ba made. The seventh day is si
like a hermit, who not only utters the erilon, d
and nupr-.bers beads, hut loves the "itudiaus ,
nook," and the lonely fecne- Nothing iniLitat
ing, therefore, .with order and peace should be
tolerated. The jovial cry may be raised, and
" qairps and cranks" uttered at Â®he " tune to ri
laugh," but {he grave and composed style-suits f'
the sobriety of the Sabbath. p
Leit the gayer department of my readers c;

vince, ta jny eonclulion, that Pleasure and Pie- .

ThÂ» msri, who has toiled,, or idled fix days, tl
may, on the morning ef a seventh, choose a re- tl
tired walk, avoiding the hijjh way, and offence a
to the Weaker brother. I will fo puritan- â¢

will naturally excite, in a good mind, the pro- ci
per emotion. Of extafy <r of rant theie is no
need. The homage of the heart is betttr than
the nafa!'twang of a whol? conventicle.

ViceConfulfhip of Virgin*,

The Vice-Conlul of theFrenA Republic, to'
* the Mayor of Norfolk
s Sir,
~ I received the honour of your letter of
g the 29th inftj I embrace the opportunity
. that now presents itfelf to devdope my opin
-1 wn, and to teftify my gratitude to you and
s the court, for the ready attention you have
f- afforded to the objeft of my reclamation:
e may it be permitted me to assure you that
1 n <3 one desires more than friyfelf to fee a uni
. J on exist.between thi French and the iuhabi
r j tants of this" town. On the firft aggreflion
(of.whi ? h Commodore Barney narrowly es
caped being the viaim) a fever? order'was
. ifiued on board the frigates to prevent any
[ fe'tmen from leaving the ships, except thole
Vvho were necessary for the service, although
F our laws permit in port 'the tenth part of
the crews to be daily on shoreâthus they
wtfre punilhed for havingbeen iiirultedâthis
was a facrifice they voluntarily made to the
- public tranquility, although ' they knew
' that there is not a code on earth that inflifts
on the innocent, punilhmeritsl incurred, by
the culpable. I need not recall to your
remembrance the discreetness and moderation
that have distinguished the French erews du
ring their stay i;i this port. Your predeces
sor has done justice to them in his letter to
the commander.' If, notwithstanding so
much prudence and precaution, they have
been exposed to new aggressions, arguments
will not then invalidate fa&s. I have efta
blilhed my. demands on a chain (series)
of insults that the French have experienced.
Is it true, that the officers and sailors in the
service of the Republic have been insulted
andoneaffaulted >ls it true,that they havenot
hitherto received any other fatisfaftion than
assurances that these excesses should not be
renewed by the individuals who committed
them ? When these excesses are repeating
in an arlarming manner, and that the a'g
greffors experience only the flight inconve
nience of furnifhing a fecurlty,. (alVays rea
dy to be found, for their future conduft,)
in agreeing with the magistrates, that their
laws of police are obflacles'to their zeal; it
remains, at the fame time certain, that as
â¢long as the guilty are. not punished, justice
has not been executed; that is,, that no pun
lfhment has been infli&ed, and, opt that
justice was not granted, as your translator
(from whom the true meaning of my expres
sions escaped ) understood It. To do justice
on an individual, lignifies in our language,
to punish him.
I should not liavs entered into this gram
mdrical explanation if I was not jealous (delir
ous) not to leave any doubt with the court
of the motives that animate me (I am ani
mated by.)
With refpeft to the tlifpute arisen between
an American and a French officer, permit me
to oÃferve, thÃt it is not here an individnal
dispute that does not'require theimerpofi
tlon of-the magistrates. A cdmlat in the
high ways* an alfembly (a cvÂ«wd)of people, in
which a French officer was assailed by his
firft adversary, and many other f>er/ons, and in
danger of his life, are not events that can be
remedied by an addition to the laws of polite
ness, but that can be prevented by reiiiforce
ing the laws of individual ferurity. Mr.
Saundei's conduft is aggravated by another
ciime ; Has he not broke open the doors ef a
Frenchman's hoUse (Mr. Blondel) t in pursuit
of his antagotiift.' t
I have made my and I again
request you to have "regard to it. Farther,
Sir, my duty with the magistrates is to be
the defender of oppressed Frenchmen.
I deelare to you, that no one feels with
more watmth than I do, the smallest insults
offered to any Frenchman whatever ; and it
is because I desire with so much ardour to prc
ferve the harmony that ought to exitt bet ween
the two natifins, that I repelled with more
firmnefs the attacks of individuals, whose toiÂ»
declared hatred endeavours to rend afuniier tl,-o,
ties that I would wish to fee drawn c'lofer be
tween France and tl:e United States.
If the warmth of my denunciations againfl
repeated aggreflions can prevent a (ingle one
for the future, or ftifle a tingle fubjeft of com
plaint between a Frenchman and an Ameri
can, I shall belme that I rander equalfervice
to your country-and mj* own.
I repose at present on the venjreauce of {he
laws and on the equity of the judges, for te
paration of the attck committed by several ot
the inhabitants united, in open day, and in
the street, on a Frenel-officer in uniform,
and without arms, and whatever may be the
judgment obtained L fhail efteera myfelf too
happy, if it is the last of thrking I shall have
occasion to folicit^
Receive, Sir, and please to prefetil to the
court, the afftirance of my rttbrft.
