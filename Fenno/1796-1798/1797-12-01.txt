For the Gazette of the lPnixed States-
MR. FEN NO,
Finding in vuur paper of the t'n vl:. un
der the Norfolk head, extracts of two let
ters said to be written from Martinique, im
plicating feveral'mercantile hoiifcs in that
1 Kland in a charge of a Very serious n .lure,
(in one of which houses I am concerned)
I deem it necessary, in otderto takeoff any
undue imprelfions which may have been
made an the public mini in regard to myfelf
as well as in juftification of tha house of
Ogden,Charrurier & Co. merchants of Mar
-1 tinique, to Rate thÂ® blowing fafts.
' j Tt may_bcj-Â« J fiary to premise that Mr.
4 J,.hrr-erran urier, who the French admimf
j t rat ion in .that Iflaud thought proper to
j arrest is not of the house of Ogden, Char
< 'W'sr & Co. but of another mercantile firm,
entirely unconnefrcd with the former, and
the fafts with regard to the money import
ed into the I Hand are Gmply thtfeâThe
fanall coin in circulation there is a nominal
thing of the value of one pennyhalf penny
currency.. This being the principal medium
of change, and becoming Vvry scarce, induc
ed some merchants to import a parcel from
England, which importation was not re
. strained by the French adminiftmion (who
have the civil government of the i\Jnnd by
capitulation) until the importers became nu
merous and the quantity imported so great
as to cauft an inconvenience in trade. The
admieiftratson then palTe(l an ordinance, itK
Hiding fine and imprisonment on any person
who (hould make any further importations
of the coin âafid a few wetks after a veflel
arriving from England, having a quantity on
board, which had been ordered out prtvi
ouily to its having bean made illegal to im
port itâthe adminiftratioil fcized on the
property of all those, who they could dis
cover had at any time imported any, and
confined Mr. John Charrurier in gaol. In
cenfequence of this violent proceeding a
partner of Mr. Joho Charrurier's entered a
formal protest against the administration,
and commenced a <uit against them, in which
be has hid His. -'..images at Â£.50,000. The
opposition thus made to the mode they had
made use of for enforcing their edicts, in
duced them to liberate Mr. Charrurier, and
i offer to restore him the (lore and property
| they had attached, which he refufed to re
' ceive, relyipg cm the hws of his country
for rcdrefs. The store of Ogden, Char
rurier & Co. having been in the fame man
j ner taken pofTefiion of, the administration
I made a similar propofalof rtflitution, which
i met with a like refufal.
Althoagh my residence is in New-York,
..I have full evidence from letters which I
have rcceive4 from Martinique, and by in
formation from a gentleman diredt from
thence, that the foregoipg is a true state
ment of the tranfaifh'or.s relative to that
hufinefsâand as the publication of the let
ters in your jrazctte (which have called forth
this juftification) principally pointed to the
house of Ogden, Charrurier & Co. with a
view no doubt of injuring its credit, aud
basely- to vilify itÂ» it has become my duty to
1 counteraa tjicir wrong tendency, and the
falfity of the charges contained in them, by
all the means in my power. As to the
house having imported base and gilt Johan
nes, it is fufficient to declare the alfertion
utterly void of- foundation and infamouily
falle, and [â  never before heard of a johannes
of that description being seen in the Island.

THURSDAY NOVEMBER 30.
Mr. Dwight Toiler, from the Committee
of Ch'.ims, made a report on t'Â»e petition of
A in Gray, unfavourable to the petitioner,
which was concurred in by tlie'Houfe.
Mr. Brookes presented the petition of
Grant, complaining of injuries sustain
ed by being captured by the Miami Indians
and kept for three years, during which time
he speaks of having experienced the greauil
cruelties,âReferred to the Committee of
Claims.
Mr. Baldwin presented a remonstrance
from the Legislature of Georgia, complain
ing of the law regulating the intereourfe
of the United States with the Indian Tribes
and also of the operation of existing Trea
ties.âReferred 10 a feleft committee of
three members.
Also, a petition from a corps of militia,
praying compensation for feryices performed
for the Un : ted Stattk.âReferred to the Se
cretary of War.
Mr. Gallatin presented the memorial of
certain citizens called Qunkers, in the name
of the annual meeting of that body, lately
held in Philadelphia. The petitioners, he
said, vtfere present. The memorialists ftatc
the distressed fitnation of 134 of their Black
Brethren in N. Carolina, who notwithstand
ing they have been manumitted, are now
I held in bondage, by cruel and retrofpeftive

' alledge, have a tendency to bring down the
judgments of God upon the country. The
' calamity lately experi:ncedi:i this city ought
I they fay, to make us eager to do away all
iniqliity. They refer the House to the so- !

I and very importani^afeSte'(.Vhich, for want

I second reading was epp yfd, on the grounds
;of the petitions containing nothing upon j
j which the House coti'd conttitntiortajly aft, .
and on account of its touching a fubjeft, the ,
dilcufrion of which, ih that House, always j
excited great j<si!aufy and uueafinefs in the
fchtrtierji by Messrs. Harper, Rut
leflfcc, Se wall,. Macon, J. Parker, Isaac Par

reading'.was supported on the ground
of its b;ing the usual course of business, as
being rcfpeftfnl to the petitioners, and as
being it oft likely to produce the best effefts;
as if a committee were appointed to make'n
report thereoa, whatever that report might
be, it would be more likely to give fatisfag
tion to the petitioners, whom all must allow
I fotfned a relpeftable part of the Communi
; ty, than to treat the petition with the cqn
-1 tempt which fame gentlemen had p'ropofed,
| by Messrs. Gallatin, Thatcher, Lyon,Swan

'the qaeftion for a second reading was at
length taken and carriedâs3 votes being
in the affirmative.
Mr. Gallatin movjd that it be referred to
1 feleft committee, which was agreed to,
59 members being for it. The committer
appointed were, Messrs. Sitgreaves, Nicho

(Much having been lately said of the dis
turbances iu Scotland, in confequeiice of
the unfavorable operation of the militia
aft in that country ; the following may
not prove unacceptable to our readers.
It is in itfelf a temperate and well pen
ned explanation of the nature, and inten
ded operafcm, of that Jaw ; and if accu
rately made, (hews it as calculated to af
-1 ford peculiar to the fubjeft in the
urgency of an cxiftiigwar.) [_N.r.Pap.~]
By his grace the Duke tf Buccleugb, lord lieu
tenant of the county cf Mid Lothian.
As it is evident, from the riotous snd
disorderly resistance which taken place
in some of the neighboring; counties to the
execution of the militia nft, that the most
ijifamous misrepresentations have been used
to millead the people, and to prejudice them
against a meafurÂ» which but a few months
before was loudly demanded by the whole
nation, the ford lieifteiiant thinks it proper
to do all in his to cnunteraft the ef
forts of the feditiom, explain to the
people the tftje meaning of the militia aft,
in so far as they ire concerned When the
aft is properly explained to them, he is fat
isficd that the people themselves will fee thro'
the designs of those who have attempted
to deceive them, ar.d who would excise them
to resist an aft which gives to this country j
a force which has always bee;i the pride of
England, is justly conlidered by all
ranks there as their belt and most constitu
tional dtfence.
1 mo. The whole of Scotland is to raise
but 6000 men, while England has at pre
sent nearly 50,000 militia aftualiy embodi
ed, and 6oÂ»oeo supplementary, or addition
al militia, who have been trained, and are
all ready to be called at a moments warning.
2 do. The age is limited by the aft to
young men between 19 and 23 inclusive, of
all ranks and degrees. This age lias obvi
ously been felefted by the Legislature, in
order that the burden may fall as lightly as
possible on those who are fit tied in life : few
of that age being married or fettled in busi
ness.
3 tio. In older to make the burden still
lighter, several exceptiu-.s > jyeâ(fcajed in the
aft, particularff *ll articled clerks and ap
prentices, and every man having more than
two children born ia wedlock. Tiie reason
ajid utility of these exceptions are obvious.
4to. In faft, it ;s a volunteer militia ; for
it is declared, tliat,jfiii any county the requi
site number of able, and fufficitut men shall
turn out as volunteers for the militia, no
ballots shall take place. Tliefe volunteer
militiamen may be of any age, pro Tided they
are .fit for service, and will be received at a
ny time before the ballot.
jto. In such counties white there shall be
a ballot, it is calculated that the lot will
fall only on one man in 8 or 10 on the lifts.
6to. The men so balloted for are not o
bliged to serve in person, but may find fub
ftitutei of any age, provided they are fit for
service.
7mo. Neither the whole or any part of
the militia shall, on any account, be carried
or ordered to go out of Scotland.
This is expressly enafted by feftion 55th
t)f the aft so that the people will fee how
fliamefully they have been tlecerV-d by those.
who would persuade flienV that't'hey would
be sent to o/to foreign countries ;
and so far are th?y from being liable to be
draughted into other regments, that it is
enafted by feft. 34.
Bvo. That if any officer or other pej.fpn
shall attempt to enlist any m)litia;ppH juto,
any other regiment, such officer fl;ajl ji
very pffence, forfeit 201. sterling, Wild tht
enliftmeut is to be void, and further* to pre
vent the militiamen, even if inclined to en
list, fronl doi:og fu, they are liable toimpVi- 1
fonmint if thev fmpofe tbeftifelves on offi- :
cers, and deny that they are militiamen. *
j 9mo, The pay of the militiamen is to be
> tilt iatne with the army, which is now raised
to one (hilling per day, which, befxdes lodg
ing, clothing, and other advantages, makes
the lituation of a militiaman superior to
most day labourers, and to many kinds of
tradesmen.
They are farther entitled to Chelfea, and
every, other privilege belonging to the mili
tia of England,. :
iomo. I:i England each patifh generally
fubfcribes,to form a fund for providing sub
stitutes, so that the burden falhf lightly on
the men who do. not chufe to "serve m per
son. The'fame mode may be adopted in
Scotland.
11 mo. It is Â«lfo to be obfervW, that the
; officers to be appointed to command tht ttti
, litia (if embodied) are to be eotnpofed of
I the gentlemen of landed properly in the
counties where such companies of corps are
to be raisedâthey will naturally make the
service as little burthenfome as poffiblt to
those under their command', harvmg-a mutu
al interest with them, that the country
should be as little as possible deprived of
their labour and assistance, either as manu
faftnrers or husbandmen.
The few upon whom the lot may fall will
have an opportunity of making themselves
known by their good conduft and regular
behaviour to those gentlemen of property
under whose command they maybe placed,
and by such conduft secure to themselves
and their families in future, their good will
and patronage.
After this faithful explanation of the aft,
and from the accounts which the lord lieii
tenant has received of the general good dis
position of the people of, this county, his
grace flatters himfelf, that every thing will
be condufted in Mid Lothian with peace
and quietness :âbut he thinks it his duty
to warn those who may be othcrwife dispos
ed, that he and his deputies are determin
ed to enforce obedience' to the laws of the
land, and to support the civil powers in the
execution Â«f tlrrfr dutyâ-If, after this no
tice, any unlawful opposition or' tumult
takes place, those concerned will have them
selves to blame for the confequenctte-; and
all persons will take notice, that every land
holder and farmer, and every houf holder,
high or low, rich or poor, is ,iable by law,
to bear his proportion of any loss or damage
fliilained by any person from the violenoe
c*fa mob.

PARIS, Sept. 2.
Much talk has been made refpefting the
great quantities of English cloths which have
lately been brought into the Republic from
Prujjla, Hamburg, Batavia, The Di
rectory has published a mefTa'ge on the fub
jeft ; âin which they inform, that they
have authorized at Rouen the importation
of 187,247 ells of blue cloth for cloathi'ng
of the soldiers ; 4,100 ells of blue cloth" for
regimentals ; 11,500 ells fcarfet for facings
&c. and 359,500 ells of blue serge and
white fh lloolis for lining. All thew arti
cles were imported in execution of a con
trhft concluded between the CommiGiorier
of the Executive Direftory at Berlin ; and
Citizen TreTcow, a Prussian merchant, who
on the security of the diamonds of the Re
public, deposited with .him, engaged to
furniffi them, provided they were fuffered
to be imported free from duty.
At Havre, Rouen and Dunkirk 220,000
ells were also, permitted to be imported from
j Germany, as also 3,251 pieces from Ham
burg, and 132 bales from, other places.
" The Impossibility," fay the Directory, "of
obtaining in France, on credit, the necessa
ry cloth for the. moft,.prcffing cloathiog of
the troops, and the opportunity which of
j fered to procure it frum abroad for tSefts
which French merchants would not have ac
cepted, and partly for bills, making part of
the contribution of a German Power, the
payment of which was by-no means certain,
induced the Direftory to fanftion these
tranlaftions, truly advantageous for the Re
public, and without which both the land
and sea forces would have been expo fed to
the utmost want. The importatian of
these articles, free from duty has not been
attended with any Joii to the national Trea
sury, becaiile without this co::dition it
would have been neceflary to pay a much
higher price, and the contractors, who re
ceived bills in payment, would never have
agreed to advance the duty.

ing ; and that his lordllyp further told the
plaintiff that he had an order from govern
ment ta transport any perfen of ba<f char
after to Botany Bay, and that he would
fer.d the plaintiff there the next day ; that
his lordship then gave verbal orders to. faM
constables to take said plaintiff to the black
hole ; as they were taking plaintiff to the
black-hole, they were met by a ferjeant of
capt. Dillon's company, who offered plain
tiff a ftnlling to enlist him in said company ;
that plaintiff having rtfufed to enlist, o\
accept as the shilling, was then very fevere-'
ly bound with ropes and put into the black
hols ; that the black-holt is a dark damp,
arched vault, fUuate under old ruins in the
demesne of hisHordfliip, to which there was
neither light or air admitted, but through,
a small spike-hole cut through a fingleftone;
that the black-hole is not a public prison or
bridewell, but used as a place of confinement
by lord Dillon only. That the person cal
led captain Dillon is the supposed natural
son of his lordship, and that hislordfhip pro
cured for him feme in the army
on the terms of his raising men, to effect
which, that his lordfliip used fuÂ£h means as
his rank and power in the country enabled
him to put in execution. That on the 13th
January, plaintiff was brought from the
black-hole into'lord Dillop's preftnee, mid
after several efforts to intimidate plaintiff by
charges ps fclon v, his lordfhjp declared there V
was evidence fufficient toliaiigth* plaintiff ;
and then ordered him tofeebrought to caps.
Dillon s barracks, where he was kept about
two hours, then hand-cuffed, and again put
into the.btficl-Lolc. From Sunday tl;e 12th
of .January, to the Ift of February, 1794,
plaintiff was kept n prisoner without any
lawful authority, and for the raoft part con
fined in the blcckrlioW.b'ut fometirfces ia the
barracksâthat he was bound wifli ropes,
and otherwifr treated with great "cruelty,
particularly that he was for 2 5 hours of his
said confinement in the black-holt, hand-cuff
ed to one Henry Dart, who, among several
others, was sent there by the said lord Dil
lon
That the plaintiff by his confinement in
the back-hole, found himfclf grown very
weak, his health otherwise much im
paired ; 'that during plaintiff's said confine
ment several efforts by threats and promlfes
were made by capt. Dillr.n, his ferjeant,and
feme .of his recruiting p3rty, and by lord
Dillon personally, to induce the plain-iff to
enlist, which he obflir.ately refufed ; that
Mi. Charles CofLllo, who is the plaintiff's
landlord, hearing of his confinement, sent
his agent to Lord Dillon, to know for what
offence plaintiff was confined, but if there
were informations sworn against bi'm for fe
lony, rti'St he might be sent to the county
goal ; aipon which application, and no in

plaintiff, he was.set at liberty.Â° fof.c:

much energy and force of argument, and
fully proved, to theaftoni'ihmentof the lean:-

weaken their har.fls and deflroy the hopes

*n PÂ»r the GAZ ETTE y tb. UNITED ST A TES,
to MR. siKtfa,
v- . 1" looking over j'our paper of last even- i
ing, I read with avidity the beginning of j
the extradls of
gÂ» and jury on the fubjeft oflibelsâl flatter
le ed myfclf that the chief juftiee, after having
is patiently remained for fix long years, a silent
1, fpe&ator of the most unparalleled abuses
poured from a particular press in this city,
1- against our own government, and the most
r _ eminent charaders in the United States, was [
now b 0 " 1 ? to fttp forth the champion for
y government, and eorred that abuse.
. His doftrine with refpeft to libels ns well
_ as the liberty cflf the press, I thought genr
> Â® ral . l y pretty corrcftâYet *1 mad confefs,
I did not perfeftly understand his nice rea- <
_ foning, where he fays, " every freeman has
e an undoubud right to lay what sentiments ]
e V please* before the public;âdechrmg -
t immediately afterwards that, if upon a fair
trul such sentiments fiiall be adjudged of
. pernicious tendency, the person publishing
. them ought to be puniflied." This rca
. foning was at fed a little too subtile for ray
g undcrftandingâl had from more gro|s rea-
I foniug been led to believe that a person had
no right to publifli any sentiments, the per- f
nirfous tendency of which were so manifeft v
as to fuhjeft him to punilhment.
1 However, my difficulties in under (landing I
t this were entirely removed, wlw;n on reading
a little further I found to my great fuprize
r that in applying his principles he totally
forgot the abuse offered our own govern- n
ment, and all its most important officers.â J,
Mr. Bache seems to have been entirely out rt
of his mindâThc French, Spaniard, and ai
' Porcupine engrofled his whole attention
Oh ! how patriotic it is to think wholly of m
Frenchmen, and forget what is due to our
selves !
The latter part of the charge unravels ft
what was at firft myfteriou3. The fame /
sentiments now published with refpeft to the a .
French, while yre are trying to negociate,
and which are in the opinion of the thief jus- Â£
tice, o: mifchrvous toridcÃcy. aod therefore
delme puniVimcnt, were on 3 forraer occa- I
fion, when held with R-i'peft to the British, Q
. while we were treating with thtm, by Uj
many thought praise-worthy. I do not fay
that this !Â»ft was the opinion of thu chief v
juftiee ; for although I might*have a right
(from his silence at the time and since) to
publish such a fentimeiit; vet I find T might n ,
be for it.
TUJs one thing, however, I will venture
to assert; that the public wilj be much grat-
ified if the chief juftiee will fstisfy them ,
how he can with impartiality come out with f
so zeal agair.ft Porcupine, since he Â«
has for fd long a time pasTed over iri silence ou
the defamatory publications of Bach,;. iâ
Is it because the defamation of the latter f
is against oui own government, and the Bri
tish ? whereas that of the former is against fl 6
democrats and the Frenchâl will not be- do
lieve it possible for a person under such so- A
lemn obligations to distribute juftiee impar
tially, to be influenced by such base motives,
however irrtfiftable the evidence may be to n
others.
I will close my obserVations by l-emark- D
ng sis it will throw any light on the sub- no
jest) that I have fornn-rly heard many a H
good democrat when publications in Bache'p ic
paper were reprobated, fay " that it was ne- to
cefTary in free governments to tolerate matiy L:
abusive things," who have, since the publi- 19
cation of Porcupine's paper, said that
" what Bache and Porcupinebothfrequent-
Iy publi (lied was intolerable, and they should I.i
be glad to fee them both fining tip togeth- hi<
er." A FRIEND TO FAIR PLAY. in

In beating into Cape-Cod harbor, you must
keep the cittern shore aboard,, initil-you get in- I

Is cale it blows so hard that you cannot beat
in the harbor, y.iu will have good anchoring
without, from to to tj fathom water.
VellVls in bay and would wish to put
