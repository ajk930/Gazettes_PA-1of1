"* WE afe next informed of Mr. Jefferfon's " at
tachment to the RELiSious rights of mankind,*'
and are referred for his sentiments refpefting religi
â¢ ous liberty to his writings, bis conduct, and partieu
j larly to the "aS ejlabli/hing religious freedom," drawn
up by him.
'P Hampden would have aftcd more wifely, and j
more conformably, I am persuaded, to the wilhes of
his patron, had he pasTed over this tender fubjeft in '
ftlence. It waÂ» certainly indifcrect to mention The
ee mas Jtfferfon and religion in the fame parat;Â»a{ih,pf 1
an eulogy.âRtligibus freedom and (freedom from re
ligicrt are now becoxne convertible tcrmÂ« with most
$ modern philqfophrrs, particularly tliofs who h3ve
been educated in the philofuphical schools ot France.
MY.'Jefferion has been heard to fay, fine* his return '
from France, that the men ot letters and philoio- '
phen he had met witb in that country, were gene- '
rally Atheifis. The late impious and blafphemeus
( works Â»f Thomas Paine, reviling the chrijtiaa reli- '
gion, havÂ« been much applauded in France, and '
have been very indultriouljy circulated in the Uni
ted States, by all that class Â«f people, who are c
friendly to Mr. Jefferfon's politics, and anxiously Â£
desirous of his els&ion to the Prefidencyi Mr. Jef- c _
ferfon'Â»~friendlhip for Peine has bfenalready men
tioned ; that anti-ibrijian writer barf apartments at Â£
Citizen Monroe's at Paris, and (hould Mr. JeSerfon r
be President, there is no doubt he would return to r
this country and be a conspicuous figure at the v
President's table at Philadelphia, where'this cn- .
lightened pair of phiiefophers wotild fraternize, aad 11
1, philosophize against the chrijiian religion,and theaa- e
furdity of religious worfiip.âWhatever new lights "
e they may have acquited in France, it iÂ» certain that a
Jefferfon had nal nrally very good prc-Uifpoptions
on the fubjedl of religion. In his notet op Virgt- r;
nia, page 169, in discussing the fubjeft o{ a
freedom, he makes this witty observationâ'" It n
" does me no injury for my neighbour ts {ay there '
" are twenty gods, or nÂ» god ;it neither picks my 11
" pocket nor breaks wy leg ; if it be said", his tef- h
rt timony in a court of jultice cannot be relied on, n
" reject it then, and be tbÂ« liigma on him In
" page 170, he fays, " millions of innoccnt men, v
n " women and the introdvSion oftbrif. v
" tianity, have been burnt, tortured, fined and im- 1
" prisoned." In page 171, speaking of the state h
o( religion in Psnnfylvania and New-York, he fays, 0
" religion there is well supported, of various kinds
e "" indeed, but all good enough ; all fufficient to pre- F
r " fetve peace and order.'' â¢
Which ought we to be most Ihocked at, the leoi' n
ty or the impiety of these remarks ? "it docs me no
injury, if my neighbour is an atheist, because it
does Â«. Â»t break my leg !"â¢ What ? do I receive no
injury, as a member of society, if lam surrounded j
with atheists, with whom I can have no social in- 1
tercoutfe, on whom there are none of those fslipi
ous and sacred ties, which retrain mankind from the C
perpetratian of crimes, and without which tics ci- V
vil society w&tild soon degenerate into a wretched *
state of barbarism, and be stained witb scenes of
- turpitude, and with every kind of atrocity ? Good r
God f is this the man the patriots have cad their
_ eyes on as fucccfTor to the virtuous Wajhington, who, '
in his farewell address, so warmly and afFectionate-
ly recommends to his fdlow-citizens, the cullivati
on if religion. Contrail with the above frivoh.ue t
and impious quotatrons* the following dignified ad- a
vice from that true patriot t "of all the difpuGti- B
" ons ard habits, which lead to political profperi- Â»
" ty, religion and morality are indispensable sup- Cl
= " ports. In vain would that man (he seems to f
Â«Â« point at J-tfcrfon !) claim the tribute of patrio
tism, who Ihould labor to subvert these great pillars t
of human happiness, theftfrmeftprops of the duties
of men and citizens. The mere politician, equally
with the pious man, ought to K*fpcft and to cherish
them. A volume could not trace all thcif eonn/xi
ons with-private and public felicity. p
Let it /imply be afited Where is the fcenrity for

that morality can be maintained, without re/igwn. ?'

It is will observed by a modern writer, "that
patriolifm, as a moral principle attaching itfelf to
political society, depends, like every other moral
principle, on itÂ» relation tc religion. Ihe creator
it- of man.has bound the social to the divine virtues, ;
and made cur devotion and Â»ur reverence ro hi.a
ji- felf, the ground work of our duties to our brethren
u- and to our country."
rn The ltd for tflab/i/bing religious freedom, in Vlr-
ginia, (the nrcefflty for which is not veiy obvious,)
. has been.much extolled by Mr. JeffVrfon's panegy
-1 f rills. l aik them what good effitfts has Â» pro
duced ? Does religion flourilh in Virginia more
r than it did ar more than in the eadern dates? Is
public worftiip better attcaded ? Are the ministers
of the gofpÂ«l setter supported, than in the ealteru
jj. (lates ? jj
, e That aft, which is nearly all preamble, setting o
e Forth a fctifs of principles, some of which are j
n proved by late experience in France to be very qn f
tiotmble, has, in nty- Opinion, an immediate ten- o
dency to produce a total disregard to public wor- (
jj ship, an ahlalute indifference to all religion whate- Â£ '
!i. ver. It dates, among other things, " that wc f(
J ought not to be obliged to support even the mini*
j. I fters of our own religious persuasion, aiad that our
- e civil rights havÂ« no more dependance on our reli
gious opinions than oil Â«ur opinions in physic or gc
ometry theaft then declares, " that no man
(hall be compelled to frequent or support any reli
lt gious wotfhip or minister whatever, and that all
n men (hall be tree to profefs, and by argument to
0 inaintain, their opinions, in matters of religion,
e without diminishing their civil capacities."
I will not accuse Mr. Jefferfon of having been
j influenced by f'ljijh jyitws, in getting this aft pasT
ed ; but thÂ»fc acquainted with h:s conduct and opi
s nions will agree with me, that he has fully taken
, advantage of every little of the preamble and enac
s sing-ciaufe : he has proved his leligious freedom, or,
rather, hi? freedom from religion, by his conduÂ£l ;
s and by his opinions, his rjgbt to maintain by argu
t ment any opinion whatcrer, in matters of religion. C 1
e Who ever few him in a place of warfliip ? The
r IBan who can fay he has seen such a phenomenon, is
[â¢_ himfelf a much greater curiosity than the elephant
! now travelling through the southern dates.
n But how inconfident, not only with truth, bat
, with'themfelves, are these vifienary philofop her*,
who are thus always Unking out some new doc- j t
u trine ? The states, that our c'rtiil rights p k
e have no dependence whatever on our religions opini- a
. ons J and yet it immediately after admits, thatr<r/r- p r
l s gious opinions may break out into overt eids against
peace and good order, and yet the Uttei jufl qaot- Z(
ed speaks of criminal *3s diHated ly religious error ! V(
What a conformity do we find between the fenti- f,,
1 men is of Mr, Jefferfon, in matters of religion, and V 1
0 thofeof Tom Paine ? Where, is the wonder, then,
11 if the woiks of the latter are circulated with so tc
" much zeal by the frier.ds of the former ? Tom C(
Paine has ridiculed the Holy Scriptuies, and repro
bated public wotfhip. Tom Jefferfon has attempt
| ed to disprove the delugeâhÂ»Â» made tt â¢ qucflion
! whether the Almighty ever had a chosen people,J
â " and has, by example and precept, /fiftouHrena/ieccf

Jottrdan, it appears, has met with a second de- <
feat, and Moreau another vi&ory. There seems in '
this, U.mething like anothpr crossing-os the-Rhine (
affair, between the two generals, to give the latter '
an opportunity of passing the Danube, and fecur- '
tng.its banks, down 10 the river Inn ; from which
to Vienna is only about 50 miles, and no other ri- 1
vei fufficicntly large, in the least to retarci the march
of victorious army. If this be the objedt of Jour
dan's feigning a defeat, our next advices will very
probably inform us of the total rout of the army
both of the archduke and Wartenfleben, by the
former, and of the running of parcllcls before the '
walls of Vienna, by the latter ;~and that (Mantua
being taker.) the whole army of Italy is callcd to
their ?.ffi3st)ce to make a ftn-ihing- (bake, a'nJ plant
