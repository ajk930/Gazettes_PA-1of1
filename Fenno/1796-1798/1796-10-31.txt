rFor the Gazette of the Unites States.
M. Fehho,
Afcurrilous writer in your Gazette of Tuesday
evening Ml, under the signature of Phocion, asserts
as follow*.
" We are informed by the Newspapers that Ran
" dolph has been to visit Mr. Jefferfon, and has
" announced his determination to feire if ele&ed
â¢Â« PrcGdent; he has not yet announced his own
Â» determination to return to his former Secretary â¢ 1
" ftlip, if his friend should be Prefirleot : bai bis
Â«Â« activity in canvnffing for him, leaves no room
" for doubt aÂ« to his wishes and expe&atiens : it
â¢â¢ is apprehended, however, by fottae of the friends '
" of both these characters, that a late legal call 1
" on sue of them, for the immediate lettlement of
*Â« some old accounts and balances, will prove highly J
injurious to both." r
The baseness of Phocion's insinuation, Mr. Fen- a
bo, as contained in the above paragraphy will be I
b;ft exposed by publishing Mr. Jefferion's fettle- P
nient of his public accounts as Secretary of State, d
made at the Treasury of the United States, the 30th
of December, 1793> being the day before he reti
red from the public service j for which ptirpofe I Â£
fend you an authentic copy of that settlement, cer
tified by Mr. Nourfe, Regilter of the Treasury,
fhewiag that the balance of 4786 dollars, 67 cents,
then Rated to be due from Mt. Jefferfon, was on
the said 30th of December 1793, paid into the
Bank of the United States by Mr. Jefferfon, and
pafled to the credit of the Department of Statt
with the bank.

efday is 'ather ftrapge that Buonaparte should not
flerts taken the trouble to inform the Direa o ry of
so important and signal a vitflory as tlytt announced
Ran- 'Â« Garrau's letter ; nor is it less singular, that nei
| has ther the General of Diviflon who acquainted Gar
sifled rau w 'th those brilliant exploits, nor the place fhotild
own have been named, from whcnce he gave this mo- 1
tary- mentous information.

â 00m In a ItauHbill ptiblifhed this morning, signed John J
: it Barker, chairman, there is this aflertion, that Mr. Â»
ends Adams Â«' avowed, tbat the government ought te J
call have the authority of changing the constitution." r
it of This is fouttdetl on an exTaft said to be taken from
ghly Â»n anfvver to I'aine's Rights of Man, under the fig-t
nature of Publicola, published twa or three years
Fen- ago in the newspapers. It is the truth, that Mr. I
