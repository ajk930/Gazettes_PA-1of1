ACCUSTOMED tciKeganl the public
vi.icc -!il. ni iments of rcfpeCt, I now Â»p- â¢
pear fed'orc vou to rel'ign the office oÂ» feiu- ,
tor of tht Unittd States, and accept the (
more arduous 3>ul difficult tafkalloted to the
chief magistrate of this state. While I ac
knowledge with gratitude, this token of
the public confidence, it is with diffidence
and anxiety that I contemplate the difficult ,
tits wlrich I lhall have to encounter in the
difchaige of-the duties attached to it; and
nothing but a firm reliance oil your candor,
friendship, and support, under the present
existing ttate of things, would have induced
me to hazard an acceptance of the impor
tant tiuft : but hpwevyr uncertain maybe ,
the frtccefs of no endea
vors (hall be wanting, on my part, to dif
chnrge my duty with tidelity to the public,
and with latisfaCtion to my own conference.
The general prosperity which atteÃus the j
public affairs of 'his state, cannot but afford |
us much encouragement and fatisfadtion.
Freed from theembarraffmertts which attend
ed os in the infancy of our government, fa
voured with the blessings of an excellent |
conftitution âzealously attached to the in
terest, prosperity and glory of our country
free'from the alarm 3 and diftrtffes of war,
from foreign manners, influence r.nd connex
ions, depending on agriculture, the most
certain of all resources ; perhaps few states
in the union can be considered in a more fa
vorable situation, or have fairer prospeCts of .
deriving fubftpntial benefits from a judicious
regulation of their internal affairs.
It has become our duty to consult and
promote thÂ« interest of our fellow-citizens,
by a faithful discharge of the different offi
ces and trusts which have been assigned to
us ; and in the performance of this duty, we
ought invariably to be governed by the con
stitution of this state, which, designating
our various powers, while we adhere to it,
in every legillative and executive aCt, we (hall
proceed on eftabliffied and just principles.
And in all our deliberations upon measures
calculated to promote the happiness and
prosperity of the state with which we are
more immediately eonneCtcd, we ought to
have a constant view to the great interest of
tjie nation, of which this state constitutes,
though not the greatest, yet a very respeCta
ble pÂ»'.rt. All the burthen of national con
cerns is by the constitution of the United
States, delegated to the national govern
ment s to that government it belongs to re
gulate our in:erconrfc6 with foreign nations
to feciire their friendship by every mean
confident with our national dignity, our na
tional happiness and prosperity ; or in cases
of the last necefiity, with the combined pow
ers of these states, to repel all hostile inva
fionsofourrights. From this fame government
we derive an additional guarantee of our in
ternal tranquillity, and the freedom of our
laws and government. The wisdom with
which that government has been administer
ed in the times of the greatest difficulty and
dangerâthe success which has hitherto at
tended the national measuresâthe known
experience, firmnefs and integrity of those
who are placed at the head of its administra
tion, ought to inspire us with a proper de
gree of confidence in the future, and to ex
cite us to every patriotic exertion in sup
port of those measures which, under provi
dence, may feeure the national prosperity.
Happily the constitution of this state, and
that of the United States, though embra
cing different obje&s, are founded in the
fame republican principles, and conclude in
the fame important end, the security of the
rights and happiness of the people. Consti
tutions thus coincident and confirming each
other, leave no room for a difference in prin
ciple, but only for a diversity of sentiment
respeCting measures fceft suited to promote
the public interest. There cannot, there
fore, be any just occasion among us for the
spirit of party and faCtion, the greatest evil
to which republican governments are ftib
jeft ; it is only .injudjjiiijj. of thc_tÂ£ndeiicy
and utility of the meafurei of government,
that there can be the prospeCt of a diversity
of sentiment ; while principles are the fame,
the freeft debates and the most critical ex
amination of every subjeCt that may come
before you will be of the greatest use : and
pn every subjeCt while the majority must, in
all cases decide, temperance and candor will
best eonduft the debate.
The necessary business Â«F Fhe fefllon will
cbme before you from a variety of sources
From the sudden transition of an appoint
ment in the federal government to the of
fice and duty on which I now enter, it can
not be expeCted that I (liould be prepared to
detail to you the public business, which will
demand your consideration. Any commu
nications which may have been made to my
deceased predecessor, governor Chittendon,
{hall be laid before you : And while I men
tion hit name, permit me to pay a refpeCt
ful tribute to his memory. It must be a
pleasing reflection, not only to his particular
friends, but to our fellow-citizens at large,
fhat-Under his administration, this govern
ment has fiauiiffied and obtained a refpcCta
blc chara&er among her sister states. The
public good unquestionably was tW chief
objeft to which his political conduit was di
rected.
Gentlemen of the house of Reprefentntivet.
The state of the public expenses and .'Â«vÂ«nue
is an objeft which most properly belongs to
your department, and cannot fail to engage
your careful attention- Tlte economy lhat will
prove eventually the most favorable to the peo
ple, is to guard against the introduiiioa of,a
public debt ; Â»othing of this nature ought to
txift in time of prosperity and peace ; and in
whatever form a public debt may exist, it can
aot fall lis iti opÂ»rirfÂ»>VrÂ» to prove unfavourable c
to the p 'ople. ' VVhiic the pwWic tspeo'es are d
managed with economy, the wrUft way to ft p- w

THE NEIGHBOR.
" Render to all their dues . âHonor to whom '
honor,"
I invite the attention of the numerous pa
trons of this paper to a fubjeft, which they
willownis at least as interesting as innumer
able others, which they read in newspaper
essays, The Importance and Respectability
of the Clergy.âShould I suggest thoughts,
which some of my readers have met with on j
other occasions, or with which they are fa- ;
miliar, I hope for their candor, feeing oth
ers may not have had the fame advantage.
The Great Superintendant of the uni
verse is pleased to carry on his plans, and to
effctl hio purposes, by subordinate instru
ments and agents. As in the natural world
he could, if he thought best, and that with
infinite ease, have sustained all creatures,
and supplied food for all flcfil, by his own
immediate agency, without the conducivenefs
of kindly seasons, or any care and toil of
the hulbandman ; so, in the moral world,
he could, with equal ease, by his invisible but
powerful influences, effectually restrain from
fin, inspire with all necessary knowledge, and
compel to the performance of duty, and
the observance of order, without rhe power
of the magistrate, er the inftruftions of the
preacher. And it was not to save himfelf
trouble, nor to make the government of the
world, or the production of holiness and
happiness amoug men, the easier to himfelf,
that he appointed such a proportion of du
ty and service to his creatures, obliging them
in some inftanees, to be mutual checks, and
i'n innumerableothers, to be mutual assistants,
so each other. But, as the allwife and be
neficent Creator has endued every creature
with faculties suited to its own and its con
nefted state, afiigned him his proper station
and sphere, and united them all by certain
common bonds ; so, the execution of these
faculties, within those spheres, strengthens
and endears those ties, causes and inoreafes
happiness, to the honor of the Prime Agent.
It is surprising and delightful to observe,
what an extenlive concatenation of subordi
nate causes and agents runs through the
natural and moral world, every link con
necting with others, and necessary in its
place. According to this subordination,
and the plan which the Divine Contriver
has eflabliflied, day and night, summer and
winter, cold and heat, feed time and har
veft,rain and fun(hine, labor andcontrivance,'
are necessary in the natural world, for the
various produdtions of the earth, for the sup
port and convenience of the animal creation,
especially of man. According to the fame
1 wife plan, the wisdom of legislators, the
. power of magistrates, the coercion of laws,
the government of families, the education of
1 schools, the studies, prayers, and labors of
â  moral and religious teachers, reading the
scriptures, attendance on public worship and
divine ordinances, are necessary in the moral
- world, to prefervt) order, to prevent vice,
> to produce virtue and happiness, and to train
I up immortal beings for immortal bleffsdnefs.
- In effedting these important purposes, no
' instruments, it is presumed, have so great a
, hand, as those which are connected with
â¢ religion. They who are put in trust with
- the gospel, are not only expeCted, but must
Â» be acknowledged, to be the most aCtive, and
r the most fuccefsful agents, in the hands of
, the Divine Spirit, in efftCtingthe virtue-and
- happiness of Iranian creatures. Every one
- who knows what religion is, even in theory,
; but especially in praCtice, knows, that it has
f the most friendly aspeCt on individuals, <md
communities ; that, so far as genuine re
ligion prevails in the heart, in life, and in
communities, so far evil is prevented, and
: happiness experienced. Religion not only
' cemprifes and enjoins ali these duties, which
J we owe to God, but those also, which we
owe to one another. And every one must
[ readily own, that if all these duties were
, praCtised, there would be universal order and
1 j tranquillity, universal love and beneficence,
â  j and therefore, universal happiness. What
ever conduces to the fuppmt of religion,con- In
d-uces to the well bring of mankind. And jfi
what can have a greater tendency to this, ti
than the institution of the gofpcl miniftrjr, I
carried into operation and effect ? What c
can tend mors to tht implantation andgrowth : o
of religion in the minds and mannÂ«rs of a
men, than, the religiou3*inftrnflion, the wife t
counsels, the pious examples, and the fervent r
prayer;., of faithful minders ? MSy it not t
be fairly concluded, that the world is prin- c
cipallyindcbtedtothisorder of men, who, by 1
education'and paafeflion, are the public in- a
ilrudtors of mankind in the things of reli- 1
gion, that this heavenly villtant is still so i
welcome a gueit ? The discharge of the i
miniderial office keeps up public worship, <
and the fan&ifying inditutiqns of chriltiani- s
ty ; exemplifies and promotes the duty of
prayer, of confeffiou and thaukfgiviag ; and
evinte3 the necessity of holding an inter
course with the God of heaven, whose blef
l sing is absolutely neccfiary to render men
profperaos and happy. Cffnfeque'ntly, that
degree of religious ( decorum and order, of
veneration for tjhe Supreme Jseing, and re
gard for the Sabbath, of tenderness of con
fciflnce, and reftr'aint from vvickednefs,
wh|ch yet remains, is chiefly to be aftribed,
under God, to the fame cause. Does not
experience and observation confirm
marks ? Do not social virtue, and true re
ligion, and consequently, peace and good
order flourifh mod in those countriei, dates,
towns and families, where a regular clergy
is mod edeemed, bed supported and attend
ed to ? On the other hand, is there not
much less morality as as piety ; much
lefsregularity and tranquillity, in those hoilf
es, parifhts and dates, where chridian in
ditutions, public worship, and the miniders
of the gospel are undervalued and neglect
ed ? It is pretty generally and readily ac
knowledged, even by those who'fet little or
nothing by religion for its own fake, that
the clergy are a ufeful set of men, cortfidered
in a view ; and on this account they
are willing tie pay them a greater degree of
refpedt and a&tttrtion than they
would. fs true, that mo
ral and relfefij.HS mftrudtions, admonitions
and reproofs, impressed from time to time
on the minds of all ages and characters,
prepares and disposes both rulers and peo
ple, for the ready and faithful discharge of
their refpeÂ£tive duties ; checks and prevents
many vices, which would otherwise prevail
to the great detriment of society ; and en
courages and facilitates the growth of those
virtues, by which individuals and the pub
lic arc made honorably and happy. But as
mankind have connexion with another world
as well as with the present, so the Â«iiniders
of religion are principally concerned with
the spiritual affairs of men relative to that
other world ; to cure them of their vicious
propenfitics and habits ; to encourage and
aflid them to live as the sons of God, with
out rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and
perverfc nation ; and to build, them up in
holiness and comfort through faith unto
salvation. So that the minidm of relig on,.
bv affiding men to become denizens of the
" Jerufalcm that is above," aflid them equal
ly in beiug uCcful and peaceable citizens of
civil communities below.
The American clergy, particularly of
New-England, have, with very few excep
tions, deferred and maintained the charac
ters of ItarncH,pious and patriotic. They
have, in general, by their good discourses
and exemplary lives, been greatly ufeful to
men with regard both to their secular and
eternal intereds. They have been honored
as instruments ofpreferving peace and good
order in societies. Their importance has
been mod sensibly felt by their country in
several critical periods, particularly in the
J American revolution, at the adoption of the
date and federal conditutions, and at a late
alarming trifis. They are friends to equal
liberty with necessary Subordination. And
I believe it may be said, without flattery to
them, or disparagement to others, that nei
ther the bodies nor the fouls of men, neither
their country nor mankind in general,
have better friends, or greater benefadtors,
than the clergy prove themfelvs to be. v
If any should think that an apology is
neceflary for writing so freely in favor of
the clergy, who are well able to defend them
i selves, I will answer in the words of a cele
, brated writer-} " I have the rather under
- taken this bufiiiefs, from a convidtion, that
I when the clergy are despised, they will de
. generate ; and that with them will decline
the morals, the learning, the religion, and
r the importance of my country."

; If common sense were to commence noisy \

f I believe it would begin with the tyranny

e tonocracy. Thanks to the spirit ef liberty,

d Therearc other grievances to be redrefled;
e my toes are this minute complaining of the
â , oppreflion of tonocracy. Nature was pleased
s to give me a pair of feet, the very contrad
d of a Chinese lady's ; falhion and the shoe
makers, fay I mud wear i pair of (harp
n toed /hoes ; they are the ton.âTonocracy
d is the mod arbitrary and whimsical of all
y " ocracies and falhion and nature are al
h ways quarrelling. My toes are crammed
e together in close prisonâthey mud be libe
!t fated, or I fliall be obliged to find other,
e than my uftial means of conveyance: tam
d ! not.the only fufferer. Now phyfieians tell
â¢, ; us, a-free circulation of the blood is necefr
i- j fary for our health and that it should never
be confined in the limbs. Tight shoes, be- c
fides causing corns, arid chafed heels and 1
toes prevent this free circulation. Again, ''
I would query with the faculty ; is hot the v
close confinement of those faithful servants, g
our feet, sometimes the cause of the cramp j
and gout ? If so, let them have ftiore liber- v
ty. Let reformation begin at home. Say '
no more about aridocracy and kingoeracy, 1
the other fide of the Atlantic, till we have
corredted the abuses of tonocracy at home.
Ease and economy in di t-fs, are the fame to
an individual, that frugality and a free con
ditutiou are to a nation ; and I believe there
is not a dwarf or giant of a politician among
us, who will not allow, that we are fleeced
and galled as much by faflÂ»ion, in one year,
as we are by adminidration in ten.

The late proceedings in the British sen

A learned gentleman, who is a firm believ

what cliffs of mankind his foul is derived, has

The fouls of deceased bailiffs and common

The terriers are inhabited by trading jus

The blood hounds were formerly a let of
informers, thief takers, and falfe evidences.
The spaniels were heretofore courtiers,
hangers on of adminidration, and hack jour

licking their hands and their spittle, and
snarling and faapping at all who offer to of

their pods ; the famous Richard commands
on tne coast and diredfs every movement.

and the ci-devants ; alrnoft every where tht

VENICE, Augud 29. |
The public will not be displeased at be- 1
ing made acquainted with the correfpon
dcnce which has taken place between Ge- '
nejal Buonaparte and the Pacha of Scutari,
the brother of the celebrated Makmoud. '
It preceded the order of proteftion pub- ;
lifhed in favor of the fubje&s of the Porte,
and particularly the Greeks and Albanians. ]
The following is a copy of the Pacha's let- 1

GOD IS GREAT, AND HIS WORKS ARE 1
WONDEJtFUL.
To the General in Chief Buonaparte, pro- (
teftor of the law of Asaâto the Pow

the general of generals, the sublime con- i
dpueror of the regions of It.ly, the mod

Prince of Generals. ,
May you obtain all your wjfhes !âMay ,
this sincere salutation reach you ! May I
karn the interesting intelligence of your be
ing in good health ! This I desire on ac
count of the friendlhip that (hall for ever u
nite us, and of which I wish to give con
stant and mod signal proofs.
The friendfhip which unites the Ottoman
Porte to the Republic of France, was al
was faithful and sincere.
The hand of fate directed by the hand of
God, in annihilating the Venetian power,
and in fubje&ing that People to your laws,
has established new relations between the
Ottoman Porte and France, and the har
mony existing between them is augmented
by the approximation of the two nations.
In this moment, this new union compels me
to a(k of you a new favour. This favour
which I am desirous of obtaining from my
sincere friend consists in thisâthat I wish
my fubjefts and my merchants who traffic
with Venice to be protested in their persons,
and in Iprafticc of their commerceâthat
hospitality be granted to them, and that
they be regarded with a friendly eye. Such
is my requed, and to obtain it I have writ
ten this letter, and sent it to the bed of my
friends. When these few lines reach you,
and when you shall have understood them
according to the spirit by which they were
dilated, I hope that the merchants of Scu
tari, my fubjeds, will be favorably received,
protected and honored. AfTured that I
shall obtain what I solicit from you, this
letter will, in the mean time, serve to express
my gratitude.
God is great, and his works are wonder
ful ! May the friendfhip that unites us last
for ever and ever !

LONDON, September T4. c
The Abbe Syeyes and his coadjutors, the I n
Committee of Safety, who have proposed the
plan of tranfporution as a rneafure of national V
iVcurUy, have evidently adopted an old faying 'â 
of this country. We have heard it given as a
toait from the Citr Chairâ" T he land we live
in ; and may those who don't likeit, leave it!"
As the Direflory have the power of wanfport
ingthe profcrihed Deputies to any place which
they may pleife to prefenhe, 1 here is not a
doubt but that they will take special care to Â°
fend them to some diQanf country, where they : _
will never more be heard of. For certain it is,
that if they are fufiered t.-> remain in Europe, p
they will very soon deteift the forgery 011 which p,
the Triumvirate have founded t'ueir accufa.ions p,
against them.
How well the French Triumviri have t'egard- j '
ed the Letter of the Conftituticn, of which
they profefs themielves such zealous defenders,
may be judged from the following ExtiaiSl,
under the Section Lrgiflative Power .
in- The Mttnbeis of the Legislative Body,
from (he moment of thÂ«ir nomination to the <
30th day after the expiration of their funiflions
cannot be brought to trial hut according to the
forms prefcrihed by the following articles :
In- They may, for criminal aits, be fcized
in Jlagr an ti dilecli, but notice mutt be given of
it, without delay to the Legislative Body, and I â¢*"
the prosecution cannot be continued till aftci
the Council of Five Hundred have propofÂ«d
the bringing to trial, and the Council of Anei- S<
ents has decreet} it. w
IIJ. Except in the cafe oifliig'/ixj deltftum, T
the Members of the Legislative Hody cannot be c
carried before tlje Officers of Police, or put in a a .
ffate of airtft before the Council of Five Hun- p,
dred has proposed the bringing to trial, and the
Council of Ancitnts has decreed it. nl
U4- In the cafe of the two preceeding Arti- â|
cles, a Member of th? Legislative liody cannot
be carried before any Tribunal hut the High f n

vres to overturn the Constitution, acd offences

Under the 6th head of Executive (PowÂ«r we w
find the following Article: ' \
145 If theDireilorv is informed that any con- J)
(piracy is plotting against the external or inter
nal fatety of the State, ii may iftue warrants of j,
fuinmons, or Warrant; of Arrejl against the
presumed authors or accomplices ; it may in
terrogate them, but it's obliged, under the pe
nalties egainlt the crime of arbritrary detention, 1
to fend them before the Officer of Police, with
in the delay of two days, to praceed according
to the laws.
N. B. All the Deputies arrested have been
ordered to be tranfporred out of the Country,
'without e-t'e.t the form of a trial, or being told
tbe nature of their offences.
All the Emigrant Writers in London have \
pledged themselves to prove, that the late tri-
umph of the French Diraiiory will ultimately p
operate to the eftablifliment of that very system
of Government, the feeds of which it was his
object to eradicate. Thu storm of the moment
fay they, will but featter them like those of the j,
thistle, to take root on more expansive ground.
The numher of Editors of papers in Paris S
condemned to tranfporution, are forty one, â (
the fate of thirteen remains tn lufgenl'e. The
Hedaifeur continues the official print-
In rrifcr to judge of the cleirance which the t j

One of the members sentenced to be ba
nished, but who has concealed himfelf in an
obfcui-e retreat, has sent a very spirited ad
dress to his conttituents. He fays, a hor
rible crime has been committed :â'l hat the
triumvirate of the directory, aided by the
armed force, had surrounded the halls of the
legislative council, prevented their afTem
bling; and had banished fifty-one of its
members :âThat a few slaves of the directo
ry, deliberating with bayonets at their
bitafts, had dated to assume the name of
the legislature ; and to pass laws :âThat a
greater stretch of military tyranny never dis
graced the annals of historyâand of all con
temptible forgeries, that was the mod con
temptibk, which charged the immortal de
fender of the republic, as being at the head
of a cenfpiracy in favor of royalifm.
It is known that all the accusations a

" the conduS oi the board of commiflioners, '

Tlie Aurora, in characterizing the profcrih
rÂ«l deputies, has demonflrated that they were
not royalists ; but, it is of little importance
whether they were or not, since our attention
must in future be occupied by the designs of
their oporefibrs. infamous retailer of
blafphcmy, Surge lit proftm, has dufe'd them
Royalists by a daih of his hafly pen, biit
the real cause of their obnoxioufnefs to him, in
field of being a prediliflion for royalty, is their
able support of the ir.terefts of this country
Hence l>!s joy at their deftruiflion âwhich'le
has juflificd on the most despotic principles !
But this tried ar.d proven servant of infidelity
needed not to have given us this new evidence
ofaftrocious depravity, in order to a jull appre
ciation of his chara<sler. Firm to the interests
of Jacobimftn, he triumphs in the idea of his
old mailer's .gain bearing the sceptre of terror :
: he already revels in delightful mafiacres, and

infiniteexccfles and atrrocious enormities, effeil
ed what the united valour of European chival
" ry attempted in vain. Slavery is alike odious,

which he pafle.d, on VÂ»?3 journey to his own v

As Mr. Mr. Bache is but a youth of yes- a
| tcrday, when compared with tlie old patri- p
' ots, who firft Hood forth in defence of the "
| invaded rights of their injured country, a- ft
| gainst the ufiirpation of Great-Britain, I ci
who am grown grey with years, and was
witness to what I relate can tell liitn, that
the testimonials of refpett which have re- v
cently been offered to the President of the
United States are no novelties to him. q
Previous to the meeting of the firft Con
gress in the year 1774, the members from
MalTachufetts (our venerable President was
one) were met, escorted and feafted (if you â
please) in all the principal towns and cities
through which they palled ; the fame pub
lic marks of refpeft were again manifefted
with increased splendour, at the meeting of
Congress in the year 1775, and in the year j<
1789, when the President was firft elefted g]
Vice-President, a troop of horse waited up
on him at his feat in Braintree, and escorted g
him from thence, to the Governor's in Bos
ton, accompanied by numbers of citizens;
from thence he was attended to Cambridge,
bya large and refpeftableconconrfe of people, g (
where he was again met by another troop
of horfc.
Throughout the state of Conne&ieut he q
received the fame marked attention ; the .
citizens of New-York were not less zealous
on that oecafion, than they have been to do
honor to him as President ; trfops of horse tc
and refpe&able citizens went an far as ] a
Kingfbride and escorted him into the Â«ity of
New-York. b|
Every person who is acquainted with the
republican manners and habits of the Presi
dent, can witness for him that every kind
of fhowr and parade are contrary to his taste
and inclination, and that they can be agree- j r
able on no other ground, than as the will of
the people, manifefting their determined re
solution to support the government and the
administrators of it, so long as the adminif- r
tration is conformable to she constitution.
As to Mr. Bache's polite alluiion to Darby A
and Joan, I eonfider that as highly honora- l '
ry to the domestic and conjugal charafter 0
of the President, who has never given his Q
children or grandchildren cause to blush for
any illegitimate offspring. I

The following article is copied from an Eng

From the completion of the remarks, may \
be augured what the sensations of the Edi
tors, and the people of all parties mutt ji
be, at reading the account of the late hor- h
rible political tornado. I
"Onemight have hoped in theprefent si- j
tuation of politics, in France, policy, if not -
principle, would have prevented the French
from again celebrating the anjiverfary of
that atevrfed day the tenth of August. J
It is holding out to the Royalists and the
Pricfts, an example which no doubt they
are anxious to follow. They hare as great "
a right to overturn the free government of
1 797Â» by perjury, infurreftion, and maffa
cree, as the republicans had to overturn the *
equally free government of 179J, by the
lame most infernal means. Indeed if any
apology could serve for fitch nefarious con
duit, the present faftion have a better right
to it, than the former. We cannot now "
enter into an inveftigau'on of the reasons for
the late conduft of the Direftory, or de
termine what measures may be tiecefTary to.
keep the volatile and flagitious Parisians in
order, but most certain it is, that the viola- J
tions of the principles of the eonftitution,
by the Dired\ory, in tampering with the *
armies, forming them into deliberative af
ftmblies, ordering their march towards the
capital, their /burning explanation juftifying
the coiidud of their commander under the
plea of ignorance, awing, if not threaten
ing the grand councils of thtrepublicât;hefe
violatious are so flagrant, that no one who
knows any thing of the matter, will dare
to charge Lou 11 XVI. with condufk in a
ny degree similar. In both cases we affirm,
theconftitution ought tohave bcenpreferved.
The concerns of a nation surely are fafer in
the hands of a freely chosen representative
body, than of any other party or dcfcrip
tion of men.

In the early times of the town of N-rw-ch,
the inhabitants used to make puddings of
such an erormous bigness, that it almost ex
ceeds the belief of modem crcdulifts. One
of these is reported to have been so large,
that when a considerable number of people
' had eaten on one fide, it fell over and, killed
three men. After this fatal accident, it
1 was ena<3ed,that a pudding should not ex
" ceed twenty cooms of corn.

' meeting, used to carry apple-pies, (of that
