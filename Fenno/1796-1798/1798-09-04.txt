PHILADELPHIA,
TUESDAY SVENING, SEPTEMBER 4.
HEALTH-OFFICE,
September 1, 1798.
Fellow-Citizens,
Impelled by the awful progress and nr.-
paralieled malignity of the prevailing fever,
we are coniirained to address your feelings,
as well as your reason, in order to avert the
fatal, deftru&ion which, with rapid strides,
is pervading our ill fated city and suburbs.
The belt (kill of our physicians, and all
the powers of n.Wicine, it must be acknow
ledged, have proved unequal in the contest
with this devouring poison-
Wit'; the most affefling fympatby and
anxious folfsitude, we have to the best of
our judgments, endeavoured to employ, as
circumftanceÃ 3ppC3red to require, 4 the pow
er and the means entrofted to us, in arrest
ing its progress, and allevbtTilr its concomi
tant miferieS. We fli.ill conMsinfi to em
ploy theiri with unrtyiitting zeal; but we
have neither the power nor ihe meani- 'o
accomplish all the measures neceflary
to check its extenfion,'or provide for the
prefling exigencies of the moment. The'
pov/ers del-gated, and appropriations made
by law. to the institutions under our direc
tion, are impotent indeed, when compared
to the magnitude of the occasion.
It remains for our fellow citizens to at
tain, by their energy, the ends which alone
tan stop its progress and diminifli its honors.
We have, i'l conjun&ion with the Guar
dians of the Poor, caused tents to be ered
ed on the eafl bank of the Schuylkill, for
the accommodation of the indigent ; where
near twelve hundred are already provided
for, out of the fund appropriated for tha or
dinary relief of the poor. This is but a
partial rnpÂ«ati" o! '' Â«Â»f the evils wMch
- environ thousands who have a claim upon
the philanthropy of those who are ia more
fortunate circttmfiances.
The d iHiculty of preparing a place of re
fuse) atprcfent, fai the country, is too well
known 5 nnd the expence attending the re
moval of a family has discouraged many
iron the attempt, who are in circumftanccs
to live comfortably at home.
What to be done ? Citizens of
refpeflability and influence 1 Come forward,
and form yotirfelves into a committee for
the purpose of ereding on the weft bank
of the Schuylkill, alt the tents that can be
collefted; let the tents be floored with
boards, and made as comfortable as poflible ;
if tents cannot be had, boards in abundance
may be procured for the ere&ion of filed,l.
Admonifn those citizens who have no place
of refuge, to take flielter there, particulirly
theft from the raft part of the city, the dif
trift of Southwark, andthe Northern Libfr- 1
tiesâin fliort, ALL who can leave their
homes without manifeft injury ; except
those who are neceflary for the proteftion
of the city and liberties.
The cotnmittce fliould have the general
i'uperiKtendai.ce and regulation of the tents,
and authority to preserve order ; contract
for certain fitppli- s of bread, meat, vegeta
ble?, wood, &c. at the lowest poflible rate's.
Those who are not in circumstances to pay,
must be supplied by puÃlic bounty.
It is at best an unequal, perhaps an unjust
mode of raifirg money by an appeal to the
humaniiy of generous individuals ; but ifon
any cccafion it may be jHftified, the present
jnay be afiumed without hesitation.
We call your attentiofi to the aftual and
undifpuifed state of our city. Consider the :
mortality and rapid increase of the sick at so 1
a period. View the lift of your phy
sicians, and mark how'few are at their pojls ; 1
ar.d we belfeve ycu will think with 11s, that
the preservation of health is onlv to be at- 1
tained by flight. ;
Do not flatter yourselves, fellow-citizen*, 1
that this picture is too highly coloured . we '
speak from convifiion, and a knowledge ef 1
facSVs ; and doubt not, luf that the lives of I
. hundreds, perhaps of thousands, nlay be pre- 1
fti ved by the adoption of these or limilar 1
mcafures. 1

A GOOD THING IN TlMii OF
t- SICKNESS.
i- A number of eflays in the q
contain abundance of in recorrimenda
-e tion of Lime as a destroyer of peih'hnTial
0 air. The p raft Ice is without doubt very
y judicious, and ought to be obfÂ«rted by all
e lioufr--k.eepers in the United States. Limj
t ia powder fhculd be ftrcwed in cellars, al
e leys and paflages frequently : and thrown
into finks and privies. This practice ought
d never to be omitted. The publishers' of;
almanacs, orimers and elemeuta-y books for I
children, (hould insert this maxim, " that ]
e Lime is the destroyer of infectious vspours.'*"
s. But excellent as Limp is, it is not so conve
-. nier.t as might be wi(he<l for at all places."
. It is tmfightly to be fprinided about the
r rooms of houses, a;d is apt to be tracked
e every where above and below (lairs. This
1 has proba' ly p evented the life of so whole
â¢. fom â  a thing in sick climbers.
a : here are however other fubilances, puf
-1 feffing mahy qualities in common with Lime,
1 and oi" fu peri or ftrcngth and virtue, which
may be employed with great advantage to
iv rcome. contaminated air in places where
. sick peifons lie. I m<an Potato. Pearl alh,
[ Salt of Tartar, Kelp aud Barilla. These
Alkajine salts are foltie of the most perfect
purifiers iti nature. They are. cheap and
easy to be procured by every body. They
difiolve most readily in water, and in that
for.n may be fpriukled over the floors, entries
and Jliirs, which they will keep clean and
sweet beyond every tiling which has ever
been tried. Noxious and contagious mat
t;rs floating io the air are attraaed by these
Salts and taken out of circulation. They
then float about do more to poison th%in
habitants. I' is au astonishing thing, that
notwiihftanding the wholesome properties
of these substances, they have been negledt
ed so long. Their unparelleled vi.tues
fhauld be held forth to public notice in the
, newfpaper3, talked of at the corners of the
ftrects, and ;tnprefl'ed upon the mind.of
every house keeper. ' It would be right in
times of fickneis to have them proclaimed
by the bell-manâand the watchman, when
he cries the hour, fliould add, that al! the
citizens might hear him, JprinUe your Jloors
with Pota/h or Barilla.
It has been affirmed that funjigations with
acids of various kinds have done wonders.
Neither Vinegar, nor Aqua-fortis, nor Brime
ftone, nor any other of the tribe ever did any
good. They only render f.,e former foul
smell imperseptible by ftirmilating the nostrils
morepowerfully themselves.and are therefore
not to be trusted. Even in the British na
vy where the most noise was made about
them, they are going into difrepnte, and
acknowledged to do more hurt thati good.
They add to ihe mass of unrefpirable air,
and do not overpower it by their opposite qua
lities as alkalies do.
Besides the healthiness of employing Al.
kahne Salts, the ladies will approve them on
account of their cleanness. They are ene
mies to all manner of dirt. The floor (for '
there (hould be 110 carpets on a lick man's
rsom in hot weather) is in due preparation 1
for fcourincr. And nothing in nature equals 1
the ease and elegance of this mode of cor- 1
reding the vitiated state of the atmosphere. 1
Adopt this method, house-keepers, and be !
fafe ; and advise all your neighbours to do 1
the like. ,

COMMUNICATION. 1
Among the truths on which- the peace,
fafety and independence of our country de- r
psnd, every true Iteart should believe, and c
every federal tongue (hould enforce this,
that the master paflions of the French gov
ernment, jnd very probdbly of that corrupt Â£
and vain nation too, are the thirst for power j
and for plunder ; and therefore, reader, ~
whosoever you may be, (unless you are a t'
French partizan, and then we do not vvilh ii
any tohger to call you reader) you will fee, v
if you are not blind, that no peace with "
France can be nv.de, saving to ourselves !-'
liberty and independence. No peace that
will reftraipi plunder and baffle their ambi- r ,
tion, would be ofFere.!, or it solemnly rati- tl
fied, long obierved by these Algtrine?. IN
Therefore again, reader, if your American c:
heart is any bigger than a chicken's, trust Â°
it,, and its honest energy, to assert ohr coun-
try's right, sooner. than any fly, trickifli trea- J 2
ty with these perfidious usurpers No other j%v
will the DireSory make till they grow, j?
honest and prefer the principles of justice to !
their own cupidity. When the white crows 11
come then trust them. w
Another truth, tlytt every true man on
the weft fide of the mountain in Vermont,
and every fnch man in Virginia, (hould trea- la
fine up in his heart, and urge upon tl;e i w
honest among his neighbors, s this, that I to
all the damning evidence of the dispatches j ' JC
never cured one Jacobin member of Cortgrefs j j* r
< f liis French d'fenf*. Not ohÂ« black heart |
became pure, by all that wafliing. The j[ u
doubting, trimmiug, halt way dolts were j pc
re- about half brought ever ia cor.fequtit:*. nid
they voted for tlie moD part on the Ameriean
fide. Had not tJie difpateftfs reached the.
pe-ple, these waxen folkn Vvguld lirfve
rt^tJieJ- more half ari'i, as wealc men,
efpecjbily if generally are. L-t
the citizens theu know, and Ift them feel, as
if they knew it, by a Voice of thunder,
ing threatening their docyn. that their work of
Â»ni- salvation is btit half done, till Veriisont', Vir
im- ginia, &c. turn out the man of fin, which is.
'hi- French, and corrup', and abTpninable, from
ent Congr fs. They mult that body
Â»n- thoroughly. Cast otn every French devil,
'are eve y unclean spirit, that yet poficfTes- it.
Then, we may be fafe, ar.d not til) then,

HONF.ST C4TIZEV,
â¢jrs j I HAVE, just met with your letters to
da-i Mfc Gekry, dated May 30, June i, and
tial | J fine 4 th, in which you beg him to let you
try- i know immediately the names of the perfjns
all i dehgnated in the Dapatc'nes from our Ea
rn.- ; veys Extraordinary by the letters W. X. Y.
al- | and Z. and the nanne of your female friend
wn ! who conversed wish Mr. Pinckney on Arae
â  litrican affairs. It is rather an extraordinary
of' request from one who knows them much
for â¢ better than Mr. Gerry does ; however, as I
la t | have the higbeft opinion of your purify,
I am willing to place it to the score of for
ve- getfubefs. Talleyrand Perigord can nev
es. er be ft;fpeÂ£icd of prevarication or decep
he tiun. I w;fh it was in mv power to fatis
ed fy you* as to all of them, but as it 13 my
i,; s trusfoitune not to be able to do this, I hasten
ie- t0 inform you Z. is the French Gentleman
who introduced Mr. Gerry to y&u on the
>f. 28th of Â®ctobr last, and between whom,
ie, Mr Gerry and yeurfelf a long Cor.verfation
en to Â°k place, which is given in the difpatcbes
to of ion- Envoys to their government, arid
re which I have here fele&ed to refirefh your
h, memory. Vide No. 2.
fe M. Y. took a nde to fee you with Mr.
a Gerry, on the 17th of December, at which
id time you told M-. Gerry that the propo
:y fitjftns M. Y. had made from you werejuft, ,
at and*that.his information waj always to be
es relied on. Vide No. 3.
id lam not pofTefied of any documents to
er enable me to recall to your recollection the
t. other personages viz. W. X. and the La
fe Jy, but am in hopc3 it will soon be in *ny
â¢y power. Mr. Gerry we are told has given
a- you the names of XY. and Z. under his
at hand and seals but, you appear to have
eg plunged so deeply in the Lethean flream,
that it is probable they have long before this
es escaped your recollection.
Ie I am not unacquainted citizen minister
ie with the predile&ion rfyour countrymen to
if forget. Mr. Genet desired to thank God
in that he had forgotten " the worm eaten rfe
:d cords of elder times, the musty proscription
n of fuper-anuup ed wisdom the laws of pa
le tiom defined by Grotiu*, Puffendorf, and
rs Vattel, where they were all in chains." You
citizen Minister have improved upon this
h plan ; he was content with forgetting the
s. absurdities of antiquity, but you with equal
grace and adroitness forget the molt recent
y tranfadb'ons of our own days ; those tOQ in
j1 which yourfelf have figured, and which can-
Is not fail to consign you to cveriafting infamy,
â e Accept citizen Minister the afl'urauces of

. rence informed gtneral Pinticney, thai he had a c
â¢" tonverfaticn with Mr. Ofraond, the private t
r and confidential secretary of the Mini/lcr of \
s Foreign Affairs, who to!d him, that the Direc- a
n tory were greatly exasperated at some parts of â 
[ s (he fpeeeh, at the Â«pening ot the last r
leffion ef Congress, and would require an ex- '
planatiyn of thtm from us. The particular 3
parts were not mentioned. In another converf- c
e ation on the fame day, the focretary informed J
0 the major, that the Minister had t'old him it
was probable we flwuld not have a public au
dience of the D-ireflory uMil fueh time as our p
negociation was finilhed; that probacy persons
might be appoinred to treat with t'3, hut they
report to him, and he ivauld have the
> direilion of the negociation. The major rtid 2
- not conceal from Mr. Ofntond his intention to
3 communicate these eonvsrfations to us "
, [No. lI.J *
On the 226 of Oflober, M. Z. a French m
t gentleman of refneflabl- charatfer, informed
Mr. Gerry that M. Talleyrar.d, Minister of '
Foreign relations, who profefied to be well dif A"
> pofetl towards the United Sia es, had expected yt
1 to have Teen the Ameriean Minij}Â«rs frequently f h
1 in their private capacities, and to have conferred
, w i' h them indivKiually on the cbjeftj of their >
, mission; and had authorized M. Z. to make I
, this communication to Mr. Gerry. The latter
' sent far his colleagues, and a conference was
held with M. Z-. on the fubjert, in which gene
â  ral Pinckney and general' Marshall exprefled to
- their opinions, that not being acquainted with
. M. Talleyrand, thtv could not with propriety c
i on him; but that according to the cuftcin
. of France, he might expeit this of Mr. Gerry,
| from a previous acquaintance in America. This '
Mr Gerry rebnSiantly complied with on the I
! atd, and with M. Z. cail.d on M. Talleyrand, op
1 I who not being then at his cilice, appointed the ch
; 38th. foe ihe interview. After the firft irnro- fa
j duilion, Mi Talleyrand-begnn the conference.
He ir.id-, that the direilory had passed an arrete, n
, which he offered for pcrufal, in which they had -<
demanded of the envoy an explanation of some VL
parts, and a reparatioii of others, of the PreQ
fulent's fpeeeh to Con j eft, of the 16th of May in
I last: He was fenfihle, he laid, that difiieulti<i no
j would exist on the parr of the Envoys relative r r .
|to this demand, but that by their off, ring money n
1 he thought he could ptev'ent the ess. & of the
Jan cite. M. Z. at itie ri quest of Mr. Gerry, re '
'having stated ;hat the envoys had no such c "
j powers; M. T/.lieyranrt replied, they can in
j such c:ife take a power on themselves, and' prov p,,
j that they should stake a loan.. Mr. Gerry* m
nd then afldreffeij M. Ta!leyri*4 diftinSly in
:an puglifh, which he said he un-ierltoid, and
stated that the ynealinefs of the Direilory re
lulting from the PrefidentJl, fpeeeh waÂ» a fub
jeil unconnedted with tf)e of their ntif-
Qou: That M. BaroÂ«j in his fpeeeh tÂ« Mr.
Monroe, On his recall, had exprclfed himfelf 111
as a manner difpkafing to the governmift.t and
er, citizens of the United States; that the President,

j r vativns on Mr. Barras fpeeeh aÂ« were neceflary
to tindieate the honour of the United States.
1S That this was not confidcred by out govern
,Hn meat as a fubjeii of dispute between the two
uy nations ; tkit having no inftvutJlioijs refptfling
al, 't> we couid not rtuke any explanations of re
jt. paration relitisg to jt ; and, that M. Talley
.j! ran '' h'mftlf was fufiiciently acquainted with the
' 'Xotilhi'.'.'.io'; of the United States to be convinced
"u 'hefrwiirervations. IVir. Gerry further Hatsd,
that th<f powers of the Envoys, as they coateiv-
J % ei), w-i r e adequate to the dilcullioti anÂ«l adjult
inen! of til porKs of difference between the
'wo nations; that they could aittr and amend
the treitv, or, if nei effary, form a new one;
â¢r- that the United Stitrs were an-:;ouily delirou;
of feiT")vit]g all, cauies of complaint bftween
themselves and France, and of reneVigg "their \
Â°J former friendlhrp and intercourse, on tenns i
which fhouid be mutually honeuraWe jj'nd be- j
neficia! to the two nations; but not on any'
other terms; that aÂ» lo a loan, we had nq powers
to whatever to make one; that if we were to at
nu - it, we fnould deceive himfeif and the
Direilory, which as men of honour we could
not do; but that we coul i fend one of our
ns number for inftru<fttons on tliis proportion, il j
n- dec med expedient, p,rovi<fed that the other ob- j
Y, je<Ss of the nej;oc ; ation could be discussed and j
id adjuftcd; that as he had c-xpreffed a desire to J
confer with the Envoys individually, it w,i S the '
w:i}) of Mr. Geny that such a conference fhouid j
â¢h r theiropinionÂ»thus be ascertained,
wliich he conceived correfpondcd with his own,
I in the partisu'ars mentioned. M. Talleyrand
y, in answer said, he fhouid be glad to confer with
â¢r- 'he other envoys individually, Suit that this
f . matter about the money rauft be fettled direflly,
without fending te America; that he would not
r coiptnunicate the arrette for a week; and that
if we couid adjust the difficulty refpetfing the
Â»y fpeeeh, an application would nevertheless go to
. u the United States for a loan. A courier arriving
111 at this moment from Italy, arid JvJ. Talleyrand
je appearing, impatient to read the letters, Mr.
n Geny took leave of hira immediately. He fol
lowcd t0 door, and desired M. Z. ro repeat
'Â° , Mr - cr ry what he, ttf. Talleyrand, had *
â¢ ' laid to him. Mr. Gerry then returned to his
n quarters with M. Z took down the particulars
tr of Us interview, as before slated, fcnt for gene- â
rals Pinckney and Marshall, and read it to tkem j
!', ' n the preience of M. Z. who confirmed, it. I
b Gene-als Pinckney and MarfhaT then desired j .

nothing to add tO'this coni#renre, and did not

LONDON, June 15.
Extradl of a letter from an officer of his ma
jesty' ship Renornmee, to a gentleman of
Haflar Hofphal, dated Cape Nichola
Male, Weft-Indies, March 21.
" On Friday evening, the 3d of thiÂ»

ed tbe gun-room, and informed in he had
iomething to communicate i he was extreme*
ly agitatedâdrops of sweat Hood Uembling
on his forehead, and fbr some space of time
he could not speak. Having fat down, and
a little composed hinjfelf, he proceeded to
inform us that one of the crew (William
Hutchfield) had been with him to disclose
a plot that was in agitation amongst the
ship s company: the outlines were, that
they were to murder the officer?, and take
the (hip into the Havannalu It would be
t(*> Udiousto relafe all the minute circum
stances :elatfve to this dark afTair. Suffice it
to fay, forty of the ftiip's company
were concerned, and fwom to hare death or
liberty. The officers were to he assassinated
in the iiisrht, by men ftatiWd for that pur.
pose. This dreadfnl plot ivonld have been
put into execution tiie night before, had' not
the hands beea turned up to reef lop fails
very opportunely about ten o'clock at night,
jtift after they had aifembled with an inten
tion to take the (hip, &c. The next night
it was determined to be piit in execution ;
when very, rery fortunately, Hutchfield was
let into the secret, and saved our lives and
his majefly's fhifv. Since that time, till our
arnval at this place (we were then cruizing
off the Havannah) every o'fficer'in the (hip,
not excepting the surgeon, has been utkler

the next morning. YoÂ» may easily co;i

proached, you had reason to fufpedt to be

THURSDAY, JUNE 14.
STATE OF IRELAND.
Mr. Baker, w th an intention to exclude
from the House during the debate
which was about to t*ke place on the pre
sent slate of Ireland, that the ft ind
ium orders oft he house be r ad j which be
ing done, ltrangers were ordered to withdraw.
While the Grangers were withdrawing,
Mr. Abbot said, that he perfeftly agreed
â¢with the honourable gentleman in the pro
priety of carrying into execution the ftand
inporderof the house wi h refpedt to the
exclusion of strangers. at this important "ri
fis, when a of so very delicate a na
ture was abmit to be discussed : But he
trusted at the farae time, that the order
w'otild be "thoroughly arritd into effect;
and he therefore hoped- it would be consider
ed, that if any person should presume to
publish an account of what pafs, or â 
what might be supposed 'o have passed, on
the fubjedl of discussion this <lay, he should
be proceeded against as guilty of a high mis
demenor, and a gross breach of the privleg
es of tb* hou'e, and be puhifhed accordingly.
Â£ Under these circumftstaces, we feel com
pelled to notice merely the object and the
result of this most interesting debate ]
Mr. iheridair, in a mull eloquent speech,
featured to tho house the lamentable llate of
fitter kingdom He concluded with
moving for a committee of inquiry, to ex
amine into the causes of the present nsbel
lion in Ireland.
This motion of Mr Sheridan was ftrons;-
ly fupportedby Lord GeorgeCavendifh,Mr.
W. Smith, generals Tarleton and Fitzpa- '
trick; Mr. Nicholls, and Mi'. Tierney.
It 'vas opposed by Mr. EKtndas, Lord ;
Hawktfbury, Mr. Canning, aiid Mr. Wind- 1
liam.
Dr Lawrence spoke at cnnliderable
length, and reprobated altogether the sys
tem which has been pursued by miniftere
with refpeel to Ireland.
The house divided on Mr- Sheridan's
motion for a committee of inquiry.
Ayes, 43 âNorn 159.
Mr. Sheridan then moved the following
addre/s to his majesty, for the purpose of
having-it recorded on the journals of the
bouse :
" That an humble Address be presented
to his Majesty, to submit our opinion to
his majesty, that the deplorable state of Ire
land calls for an immediate and totsl charge ,
of councils and measures in that kingdom;'
that if the system of coercion, inforced iu the
manner it has been, should succeed to the
full extent of the most sanguine expeftations
of those who have advised it, the conquest
of a defart is all that can be obtained by it;
and that Ireland, so reduced, and so defoliate,'
can no way be preserved but by a continued
waste of the wealth and strength of Great
Britain, for which no other return from
that country can be rationally expe&ed but â¢
imp acab'e hatred, waiting for revenge ,
âThat if these measures fail, the possibility
of which no wife government would leave
out of its calculation, Ireland will not merely
be loft, tut may-become an accuffion to the
power of and England be exposed
to the iffueof a contest, on J: nglifh ground, '
not for acquisition or dominion, butprobably
for existence.
'â¢ We should fail in the duty we have |
eundertaken, if we did not,at the fame time,
exprtfsto ycur-Majefty ourabfolute convic
tion, that no change of system in Ireland
would be effectual to its purposes, without a
removal of those persons whose councils have
produced the present calamities and who
cannot in reaf in be considered as capable of f
correfting their own errors, or of attempting a
it with sincerity ; and whose past coifdud, f
both in p.atlice and profeflion, renders it J,
impossible for them, even were they to aft j,
on a fmcere conviction of past error, to raise 0
and expeftation io Ireland of such a govern S
ment, on temperate ptinciples, as might dif
pose the people to submit to the regular and
indispensable restraints of justice adtniaifttr
ed according to law, or even ta accept of
ijonceffions without distrust, or of benefits
wilh gratitude. '
" Nothing, in our opinion, but a total 3
change of men. as as measure, can pre- b
vent the olhcrwile certain alit nation, and h
kdicre than poll-.ble separation, of that coun-
Riyfrom Great-Bri ain." g
' The question being put on the address, it
was negatived without a division. V

MEDICAL ADVICE
To the Citizens of Philadelphia.
The following direfiions for the prevention
and treatment of the prevailing fever, are
affe&ionately recommended to those citi
zens of Philadelphia, who are unable to
procure the regular attendance and advice
of Physicians, by
BENJAMIN RUSH,
SAMUEL P. GRIFFITHS.
September 3d,. 1798*.
THE feeds of the disease may exist in the
body for acsnfiderable time, without doing
any harm. It i: generally excited by one or
more of the following causes, which of
course ought to be carefully avoided, viz :
fatigue, a long walk, landing in the ftia,
ot in a current of air, intemperance incit
ing and drinking, coftivenefs, violent pa/"
lions, or sudden emotions of the mind, thin I
drefled, light bed cloathea, and above all. 1
the night air.
It is of consequence for our citizens to '
know that we have but one fever in our i
city at present, and that every febrile indif- j
jiofition partakes of the prevailing malignant
epidemic. Hundreds have died from mista
king the firft stage of the fevet for a com- a
mon cold. The miflake is a natural one, 1
for it com'es on like a cold, and is frequently 1
xcited by cool, or cold air. This remark J
is intended to productj applications for me
dical aid as soon as poflible after feeling the J
ieaft fyrr.ptonj of indjfpofition at tke present
junfture. f
In the forming state of the fever when r
the patient feels slightly indisposed, and be- <]
fore Ik- isccnfiued to his bed, the following d
remedies generally cheek the disease.
A purge of Salts, Castor Oil or a D <fe
of Jalap and Calomel. It these fail of giv- r
i"g relief, a gentle sweat should be excited
in the usual way. If there be much pain in d
the head or back, and the pulfe'be full, or l '
tenfr, ten or twelvr ounces of blood should 1
be loft, before the use < f the sweat, and
either before or after taking the purge. f,
Er-tire reft fiptn business and excrcife of all
Â® kinds will be neceflary to give efficacy to (fee |
above remedies.
If the exiftehce of the difeaf- w re more
earl}-, and more gmera'ly admitted; and li e ft
'fmedieswliichhavebeen recommended, used p
btf re the fiver waseo pletelvformrd, there ft
are the ftrongtft reasons to believe therie
would be much less mortality fr rri it.
After ihe disease is form d, ana appears L
with wre or left of the following fympto\ s,
viz chills, great hrat, head j<?he,a i cjriefj
in the eyes, fitknefs at the stomach, vomit
ing, pains in the back, limbs and boweU,
See. the f llowiV.g remedies are proper.
I. The loss of ten or twelve ounces of
blood two or th e * times a d<y, while the
pulse con'inUes to bf full, or tense. âIf the
ptllfe fhculd bt pouter, and apparent y weaker
than natural, it calls for bleeding as much as
it does ivhen it discovers preternatural fiu
nejs and tendon.
t. The bowels flioiild be purged at the
fame time with calomel mixed with jalap or
rhetibarb in powders or in pills. The <-pe
ration of this purging medicine fliould be
aided, when prafticable, by Glyfters com
posed of half a . ounce of Glaubers salts dis
solved in half a pint of warm water, or of
half a pint of warm-water with fwc.t oil,
molafT s, and common fait of each a table
' fpooliful, in it.
Ihe bowels should be kept gently open Pi
through the whole course of the disease, by
j means of the above glyfters, and any other
gently purging medicine.
3. If the stomach should b-fick and op
preiTed with bile, a vomit of Ipecacuana, (
or Tartar emetic may be given at any time
on the Jd or 4th day of the disease, provi- I
' ded the pialfe has been reduced by previous
I bleeding and purging. fivco ten \/
drops of laudanum may be given to compose Q f
the stomach if the vomit should operate day
more than three or four times. the
4 Calomel should be given from the be
ginning, in dofesof from two to five graft s c ' r .
_ every liours, in order to excite a sali
vation. If the calomel should purge more aw '
than two or three times a day, four or five or
drops of laudanum may be given two or arc
three times a day, in order to confine the to (
calomel to the bowels, and thereby to de- ?' ei
tef nine it to the mouth and throat. We ' ~ n |
have seen no death where this medicine has whl
produced a fslivatjpn. ! ton
5. After the pulse is reduced by bleeding ' acci
and purging if the disease has not yielded, pait
a profufe fvveat should be excited by wrap- 4cr ,
ping the patient up in blankets, with five or m:i
fix hot bricks wetted with vinegar applied " f "''
to different parts of h's bsdf, and giving
him at the fame time large and repeated of a
draughts duringtwenty four hours of hot and
cammomile or sage tea, rfbT lemmonade or Â» '
weak punch, or any other hot liquor that tnj!
is agreeable to him, to drink. This sweat co "
should be continued for twenty-four hours
'till the patient is out f danger. thei
6. Blitters should be applied to the wrists enjo
and ankles, in common cases, ab..ut the brin
third or fourth day of the fever if the pulse in Â«
be reduced, or the ficknefg at stomach iÂ« said
troubleforae. If the head be much ass -fted, 1
a blister should be applied to the ne kor to n
tjie crown of the head, firft cutting off the !
hair and shaving it, and if the stomach 1
should be iugch affefled after the third or f"
fourth day ala-ge blister should be applied n.
to it.
7 In cafe of delirium with a languid â¢'
pulse poultices of raw garlic with a little
mustard should be applied to the feet.
8. Fresh air should beadmitted into sick T
rooms at all times, and cool air h the be-. nun
ginning of the fever when the skin is hat, , to \ ni
and the pulse full and tense. In this slate '
of the fever, the hands, feet and face fliould 1 â-
be wafnedien or twelve time* a dsy with
cold water. In a cool (late of the (kin, or J
when the body is crvered with sweat, cool
air and cold water are improper. T
9- The body and bed linen of the flck ; th!r '
should be frequently changed, and all often- '" g '
five matters discharged from them, should ?c
be instantly removed.
In cases of great weakness the patient
fliould not be permitted to rife from his bed
when under the operation of purging phy-
sic nor upon any othe: occzfiop.
10, The drinks of sick people in the be- H
ginning of the fever, fliould be to ft and S refl
water, tamarind water, lemonade, current 1 ââ â
jelly diflolved in water, apple water or bar
ley water. In the latter ft.ige of the ftver, \
the drinks may be porter and watei', claret j
and water, milk and water or camomile tea. 3
Weak tea and coffee may be taksn in â f]
the beginning of the fever. Jnitsfecond 1
stage the patient may tat bread and - ilk
with roasted appies or foft peaches, cho
colate, sago, tapioca, ripe fruits, weak chick- AT
en or veal broatft, and a little boiled chicken.
It will be improper to depend exclusive- ',
ly upon any one of the above remedies. <Mth
The combined force of them 211 is 'arely be*"
fufficient in manycafes to overcome thi*3 for ,hls '
midable disease.

Fes Ixsoramce against Fire, on Dwelling
! Hoirfea, Ware-Houl'es, and other Buildings (and
! on Goods contained in such Buildings) diltant from
Philadelphia, in the United States.
T. Cortmon lufurance;, on hazards of the firS
class, will he undertaken at a premium of about
halt per cnt. per annum. For extra haurdous
rifqnes a Targer premium willbe required, which
will vaiy according to eireu'siflances, feidom ex
ceeding one per cent, per annum ; but iijjfome in-'
(lances, where the property ir.fured is not only in
itfelf extra hazardous, but rendered {till more so
by the vicinity of extra hazardous buildings and
occupations, the premium demanded wdl be raised
according to circumrtr.r.ces.
Houles and Ware-Houses, the walls and purti
tions of which are wholly of stone of brick, well
conftruiled, so as to b* guarded as well as may be
againfl fires from within, and free from extra ha
zardous buildings and occupations in their neigh
borhood, will he deemed hazardous of the firil
â¢ class, and may be insured te their full value.
Also Goods and- Merchandize, not o! an extra
hazardous kind, in calks, bales, or packages, de
pofitcd in such to an amount not ex
ceeding jcoo dollars ; but if more than thisfum
is required to be infnred in one tenement, an addi
tional premiiim will be required, in proportion to
circuÂ»iftances.
11. lnfurances will also be made on buildings ar.d
goods extra hazardous, at premiums proportioned
to tha risque. But it is not e?,fy to arrange these
under particular heads or daffes, so a? to defciil e
each with the neceflary accuracy. Each muft
therefore be decided upon according to the circuoi
ftances artrading it ; 3nd these circumflances wi!i,
in geÃf-ral, appear from the description accompa
uying the application.
Buildings partly conftruited of brick or (lone,
arc preferable to those wholly wooder. And in
both cases, the stile of bulliaing, how they are oc
cupied, how they are fituited, the neighboring
buildings, andhow occupied, are considerations to
be taken into view. And wkhrcfpeil tegoods,
their tendency, whether from their nature, or
from the manner in which they are cxpofed, cither
to commence or to increase an accidental fire, and
their liability in such state to receive damage by
wet, or by sudden and hafly removal, or to be t'o
len iÂ« time of confufion and hurry, are all cir
cumflances of weight ; and the premiums mull be
proportioned accordingly.
lIK The following condjtiont are to be under
stood by the parties .
ifc. The Insurance is net binding till the (lipu
lated premium be paid ; but it shall he deemed ef
fectual from the time of such and accep
tance 'hereof, whether the policy be immediately
fignedornot. â¢.
2d. lnfurances may be renewed at the expira
tion of the term of the policy, without further ex
peiifes than the payment of the premium of the re
newed term, the circumftancescontinuing the fame
as they were anderflood by the Infurt rs it the time
the former insurance was made ; but the payment
of the premhitn is essential to such renewal; and
if the Varty in/ujed fullers any time to elapse after
the expiration of the former infuranee, before he
pays a premium for the renewal, he is not insured
during such time; nor can the insurance be renew
ed en the former policy but by computing the,
commencement of the renewal from the expiration
of the former insurance. The fubjeil of iofur
ance may nevertheless be open to treaty.tor a new
infurante.
3d. If any otherinfurancs be made 011 the fame
property ; it mud Ue made known at the tmie of
application, otherwise the policy made on such ap
plication will be void.
4th Goods held in trull, or on 'consignment,
raay be insured as filch in a separate policy; but
they are not te be considered as infuied atherwife.
sth. This company wit! not be liable or accoun
table for any loss or damage occafiotied by any for
eign invasion, or by any military or usurped force
or by reafor. of any ci/i 1 cooimotion ;or occasion,
ed by gunpowder, aquafortis or other thing of th
like ki.id kept in the building, or amongst the pro
perty insured.
6th. Bills of Exchange, Bonds and other Secu
rities, Title Deads, Money, Bank and other pro
mifTsry Notes, are not included in any insurance ;
nor are paintings, nedals, jewels, gems, antique
Ctiriofities, or mirrors exceeding the value of twen
ty-five dollars each, to be considered as insured une
less particularly mentioned and by ffecialagree
ment.
;th. No insurance will be made for a ftiorter
term than one year, nor for a longer term than se
ven years. Persons choosing to insure for seven
years (ball he allowed one year's premium by way
