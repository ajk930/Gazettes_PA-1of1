' TO THi PEOPLE OF VIRGINIA. A
P
/V//o.' Citizen J, t
IN dilafling the constitutionality of the
Sedition law, some notice was unavoidably H
â¢ taken of ae otl er objeflions that have been t
[ made to i| and which the rcmonllrance very n
' truly reprfents as of inferior weight. It t
. has beenibje&ed that this lawJias created a
new offtuesâwhat are they ? The law has ''
: been verblly laid before you, and relates Â»
only to wo kinds of offerees, unlawful t!
: ; confpiracs againH the government and laws "
" jof the Uited States, and malicious librls d
against th government or either house of o
. congress c the president. Is either a new c
offence ? You have been told that an un- f<
: lawful con'piracy to subvert the government, t
1 or to preveit the due execution of the laws, a
is an offerce newly created by thiÂ» aft of ft
congress. Rather I should fay it was an o
. ofience criated by the confiitution, was co- t
. eval with t, and punilhableas a trcafo:>able v
1 | mifdemeaior, though no law of congress t
' had been defining the puniftiment. As v
[ a general principle, disobedience to a law p
is i publi: offence, and, consequently, dif
1 obtdience to the conftinti'.n, which is the a
. fuptcmelaw above all earthly laws, must be 1
a ptfcli: offence. Can then an unlawful t
â¢ confp'ncy to oppose and prevent the due a
execution of the powers of the confti'tution v
or of t)e laws, be deemed a new offence ? c
I almot blulh while I answer before a fen- 1
Cble pople an objeftion a3 fiitJe as impjfl Â«
' dent. " If (fays the rtrnonftrance) we f
were nfluemed by any vague opinions of I
the rijht of the government to defend it- j
felf bylaws against libels, 'riots and unlaw- i
ful afTrnblies, we should be checked in no 1
small (egrce by the spirit of the provifiens
againfttreafon, which may be defined adit
reS alack upon the existence of the ge. e
vernmeit. Supreme in enormity as this f
crime s, it is reft'ifted to two cases ex- >
prefTed n language which for centuries have 11
been fix d judicial decisions." What, ' '
is it dened that the government may defend ]
itfelf by laws against libels and treasonable '
confpira:ies ? Can any propofitiori more 'â¢
direftly ittack the existence of the govern- 1
meÃt thin this? Does it not explala the <
intentiors of the authors and pations of the 1
fentinsents contained in this remonflrance <
from Albemarle ? Is treason itfelf more di- i
re&ly pointed against the existence of the >
conftitttion than the sentiment that the 1
United States may not protect and defend' '
themselves by laws against conspiracies for 1
flopping the wheels of government ? Be- '
rtie \jioj.c * s 1 nfifl iâ ii tj iii rcTyrng" :
war against t4Â»Â«m or in adhering to their '
enemies, giving them aid and comfort."' it
is inferrd in the remonftranire that a eon- i
fpiracy to commit treason is no offen.ee at I
all, or tlat it is a new offence, unkoown
till the fidition lav was passed. tan this,
for a monejtt, be conceived to be a jÂ»ft in-*
Â» ference ? Eut suppose a new offence has
been introduced by this law, I demand of
any good :itizen, who. loves his countrv,
If it has no: beeti proper in itfelf. Congress
iÂ« empowe ed " to. provide for calling forth
_ the militiato execute the laws of the ttnion,
jupprefs infiirreaiont, and repel invasions." j
- If such be the power of Congress, it feetr.s I
to be their legislative duty to make a call : '
. upon th: militia for any of those purposes as
seldom leceffary as poflibleâor shall the
laws be uffered to. be impeded in their exe
fe cucion ly combinations, of conspirators,
y until fu<h combinations are suppressed bv
the mfli'a ?âfhall iofurgents be permit
ted to oijanize themselves for serious te
fiftance, before the hand of government
ie shall; be tretched forth to reduce them
m to obediere ? Rather, ought not all such
xe unwarrantble and definitive conspiracies
' to be prremed" m the due and ordinary
:i Â«iurfe ofegal punishment, and the militia
ir be relievd from the painful service of ufirg i
>- arms agaift their fellow citizens ? Are no* <
treafonabe conspirators the precursors of
_ treason ?If the former nav rightfully grow
up and flurilh, and there can be no law to
n prevent tfem, will not their fruit be open
rebellion nd treason ? I cannot believe tiiat
' o this doftrie has been generally seen in jts i
t- ' Tue light a this slate. It is a doftrme too â¢
unnatural, too unreasonable, too monstrous
for any to advocate, who have a
rial wi/bjr the continuance of our conjlitutinn.
'i While it akes away the power of felf pre--
fitrvntion, itgi'ves a vital flab to. it ; and I
am lure tSa many who have been led by
means of g:o"s misrepresentations of this and
ie other laws toeDmplain of them, have not a
wish to put ai end to the government.
Another cafe of diffatisfsftion is dated
to be, that th expreflions of the law are
vague and unertain ; and that old offences
are newly mocfied. To this, a short anf
wer may be gven. Examine the law and
yoa will find the expreflions the fame as
have been alvays in commsn use among
us, and whofemeaning has been definitely
fettled in ourmurts. An unlawful conspi
racy of a nunber of- perfbns, with intent
to oppose anr measure of the govern
ment, direfld by the proper authori.
ty , or with iitent to impede the opera
tion of any lav or to intimidate or pre
_ any perfÂ« holding an office under
the United Sites, from performing his
â  $ tC^C ' a,l g ua g c adapted to the
_ unckrfranding f eTer y citizen. So also,
e " to counsel, ivift, or attempt to procure
'"furrtaion riot, unlawful assembly er
combination, *vit> intent" to do either of the
evil acts beforentniioncd, seem to be words
' equally pla-r. and intelligible.' " To wite,
; print, ui'er or publiili ;or to procure to be .
' written, printed, uttered or ptiblifhed ; or '
knowingly and willing'y to ailift or aio in
writing" printing, uttering or publishing,
any falfe, scandalous and malicious writings
against the government of the United States 1
or either houses of congress, or the ?
dent, with intent to defarr.e either of them," '
3re expressions free from doubt ; and I re
gret to observe, that offences have bee'i too
long permitted with impunity. In all these
case s , 91 evil intent is indifpenfible to ccn
ftitute the offence ; and in all trials the jury
possess the exclusive right of deciding vvhe
ther tl,e intent be good or bad.
To irive force to of this kind, ''
it is painful to remark the misrepresenta
tions which have found thtir way in the Ie- â¢
monflrance. It afierts, that " the turpi
tude of a uiiblic officer may def-rve censure;
1 and yet if there be a combination between
, Iwo men to exhibit hi nto the world, as ur.. "
1 worthy of confidence for that very conduct,
this mayfall under the severe, denomination
: of intimidating or preventing him from un- a
dertaking, performing or executing f.!3 trull J
â¢ or duty." This is not truly said of the law.
A publick officer is still an objeft of candid
. fcutiny as heretofore. He may be exhibi- '
, ted in his real colours, as freely now as at
any time heretofore ; and there is no re-
F ftraint Â»;pon speaking or printing the troth 1 j
1 of any public officer whatever. As ta li- | 2
. bels, those only are mentioned in the law ! 1
â  who'll defame the gov. rn'ment or either
i house of conareU, or the president, and e-
5 very-other officer re<roan>s under the ancient
r pro'tedion of the laws and constitution.
Equally fha neful and groi'.ndlefs is the
; assertion, that "he who harely records po
; liiical events, and dr|ws corclulions front |
1 them unfavorable to a president wilhomt t
; any intention to publish them ; the historian j
1 who writes now, but postpones the publi
? cation until the tumult shall have subsided is
- Table to a fihe of twi thousand dollars aiÂ«l
Jan impiifonment of tjvo years." In the
e fame spirit it is also said that "if a printer
f be tim'iS. he will discard every pi A ure of t
- public affairs or public servants, which i â¢ (
- not so emblazoned with flattery as to fiireld
j him from the possibility of puniftiment."
s In a former paper I endeavored to shew
that the freedom of the press was unabridg- r
. ed, and if I have proved that to your satis- '
s ; faflion, which I trust I have done, nothing 1
. jre nains to l>e adde t to prove the fallacy of 1
e j these assertions. But as if determined to c
: t ' reach thehigheft poin< poflible for the pur- 1
d pose of alarming your fears, theremonftrance ]
e ilates that " one neighbor cannot lend to â¢
e another for perusal a new/paper, which he
1. knows to contain an assault on the president
e coming within this atl, because this *i'oula '
e be uttering or publishing -" I have obferv- '
e ed already that there can be no offence com- '
i. mitted against this law without an evil jV
e tent, such as the law has described. How
e then can the harmless loan of a newspaper
d ' be tortured into a crime ? What is there in
>r the law, or any law of congress. which
warrants so incredible a representation ? Is
ft it not an experiment on your credulity and
juui '
ir you to consider by what means, and for ;
it what ends, so many erroneous ftatejnents,
i- and so many disquieting assertions are to be
it founi in a remonflranee coming from acoun
a ty in which, at leafl, correft information i
' might be obtained.

CONG RETS S AT RASTADT.
Yesterday evening the French legatioa
delivered in the following notes to the InÂ»-
perial Minister Plenipotentiary.
Th underfigued ministers plenipotentia
ry of the Trench repu'Jic for negociating a
peace with the Gerrtian have re
ceived the note of the deputation of the em
pire, which was cemmuaicated to> them on
' the 15th Frudtidor (Sept. vi) by the min
ister plenipotentiary of his Imperial majesty,
; Whatever may be the fatisfadtion whici
the undersigned may derive fiom the paciiic
language of the deputation of the empire f'
whatever may*%e the confidence they 3rer
difpefrd lo place in it, they are neverthelefÂ»
compelled' to obferw,. that si&er more than
nine months {pent in. ncgociation, \vordf r
and evqn intentions, are not fi.fÃjient ; re
alities are heceffary iu ord. rto prove a sin
cere desire for peace- Peace mult be con
clu ed, and the underligued are unremit
ting in their endeavors to hold it out. It i*
true, indeed, tliat the deputation seems at
present disposed to tmerje from that state
of indecision in which it has bten h:ld ; is
has recently assented to one of Â«lic impor
tant demand? which have been made in the
name of the French republic (to wit) the
demolition of the forlifka;ions of Ehren
breitftein ; and this aflent, which it this day
renew, is expreffedin a manner which (hews
that the undersigned were not deceived when
they made the uncontradiSed declaration*
that they regarded and accepted that assent
as pure and Ample. But why permit to
remain in oue c-f the preceding conclusumt
the conditional disposition that had crept
into it ? Why fiuftrate the good eflefls cf
a revolution, which, by obviating difficul
ties, and by reltoring to the facrifice made
by the dtputation the whole of its merit,
mighf have given to the French gore nmentan addition*! dfTuraiitfe, o r the rtciptovaj ]
loyalty of the negotiations, and a firmer' j
foliditv to future engagements ? It is also 1
true that the deputation of the empire fliews i
itfelf fully disposed t<V cede n the French ;
repobl'C the fortified island of St. Peter ; 1
but it seems to set an exag 'erated price tip- 1
on that ceflion, which wou'.d considerably I
reduce its value, and even the mere propo ;
sal of it would induce a belief that the de- <
putation too ealily forgot the mar.y facrifi
ccs which the French government lias al
ready made with a wish to rcflore peace to
the empire. I'is in general a mistake, and
one can and ought to repeat it, to think of
ettablifhing between two contra&ing powers
a reciprocity of advantages rigorously ex
ail : that nice balance is scarcely ever to be
found, either i" the nature of things, or the 1
refpe&ive position of persons; and if it '
could be admitted in the present
tion, it is evident that here would result (
from it a real inequality for the French re
public, which in that cafe would not only 1
lefe a confi fersble part of the proportional |'
fatufadlion which is due to it but whi< h r
would also fte dimioifhed in its hands the |
important advantages whith it might have i j
preserved, and which diminution would rife ;
from the effect of that reciprocity. Such t
a fgfletn, utterly irrecoucileahle with any ;
peace whatever, and much more unfounded, 1
when contrafled with the splendor of the '
French viftories, cotild nevei be seriously in- j
filled on by sincere and juditiousnegotiators.
Notvvithftandingthefeohferrations, which i
were dtemed 1 neceflary, underligned i i
will net deny but that tin note of the depu- - 1
. ration of the empire has offered them some r
melioration in the state of affairs, and the J
happy though tardy pofiibiiity of a result ,
impatiently looked f.-r by both nations. It i
appear?, indeed, from the analylis of that c
note, that at least all the eflential difficul- 1
ties are now reducible to these three quef- 1
lions :
, 1. The retaining by the French, or the J
restitution to the empire, of the fortified |
places Kehl and CaflTcl. ,
2. Theti'.nafer upon the countries given f
in exchange on the right bank of the Rhine f
of the debts which (hall fall u,'on those ced- *
ed 011 the left hank. (
3. The application or exemption of the [
French laws concerning the emigrants. All t
the reft, as the deputation observe, will be a
easily ai'jufled, when the great obflacles b
are removed. The attention of the under- 1
signed then is wholly dire&ed to these three ''
questions, and the examination they have [
given to them has been the more fcrupu- 3
lous, because the two lad seem nearly to o
affeft the welfare, the liberty, and the for- tl
tureofagreat number of families in the e
two Hates ; obje&s which the French go- 0
â¼eminent holds sacred in its politicalrelations c
with other countries, as well as in its inter-
nal administration. Accordingly they do t<
not hesitate to make the following procla- c
mations and declarations, at the fame time t'
under the exprtfs reservation that the fortifi- h
ed island of St. Pitrre shall immediately be J
ceded to the French republic, and at the
fame ttmesll the clatiÂ£ea_Aiui.-' >
nexed to the demolition of Ehrcnbreitftein, tl
and other demands of the und rligneu, fliall
be annulled. ri
1. It would be nfelef here to relate the ''
â¢well known reasons which so powerfully 11
induce the French republic to retain pof- 'j
ftffiofi of Caflel ar.d Kehl, with their de- |,
jiei.tlencits. The fame reafo.is (lill prevent n
them from agreeing totally to abandon
these poffeffioMs. It is natural to believe 11
tSat the praiccs and . thrr states of the em Cl
pire fliould consider thii point in a political
view, that they fhau'.J ultimately regret
their not hanng fufliciently pjreeived or
properly appraciated this objeil. But in
flead of a faiutary confidence, in feeing se
veral fortified plaaes iu the hands of the
Freneh, they frem to have experienced an
opposite feeling. In order to expel all ap
preheÂ«fions, the Fiench epublic give? up 2
the fortrefles of Kehl and Caflel, which ri
stall be d ra..lifhed, and only (ha!) retain the I
territories.
2. With refpedl to the deiots ; the depu- 1
tation fr.rely have not prefurr.ed that the h
French government could jigree to any ar- n
rangement which fliou'd be calculated too ti

plenipotentiary of the French republic give a

Dulnefs is not the less obnoxious for its great

zettes are firiking evidences. From the Farthing
Post, to thr Daily Royal, they are alike insipid

flat at both ends, and as to any thing else, a

defend with their lives the present adminiitra

a b Id hyperbole.
The insolent Barras, in the noon tide of
his fortune, vaunted of the esteem in which
France was held by her allirs. " France,

Â»Â« surrounded by a crowd of victories," See.
âThis ufurper looked only on
one fide of the mirror. A little penetration

MR. FENNO,
. IN your Gazette I have noted that long
expeftcd event, the expuliion of the French .
agents from St. Domingo, with much filea
fure. The many robberies which have
been committed by Santhonax ai d his
French fucceflors form a striking contralt
with the honorable conduit of the black
chief Touffsint, now fovern'gn lord of St.
Domingo, and whatever may be the form
of the new government for that iflaiid, it
mini at all events be better than the last.
If the British government fliould join with
un in our wishes for the Indep ndence of St.
Domingi), it will be fortunate for both
countries, and humble the vanity of the.
Cinque 1 et?s more than the defeat of admi
