SIR,
Having been recently restored from the brink of
the grave, by your invaluable medicine, I think it
my duty to make this public acknowledgment of
the fame, for the benefit of others aillidled with a* v
fimiiar complaint. 1 had been afflicted with a most f
dreadful auhnia for about twenty-three years. I 0
never for years got any reft, my cough was so j
troublesome in the night; and used to discharge an
ilrnoll incredible quantity of glutinous matter
from my lungs ; and my breath was so exceeding
Ihort that I could not walk across my room. Pro
videntially hearing of your Cough Drops, I too,
them ; and, through taking them alone, I am now
bluffed be God! rcftored to perfeift health. My
cafe is w*Â»ll known to the members of the Ebene
zer Chapel, in Lincoln's-Inn-Field, of which I am
ajfo a member ; and any of them will gladly fa
tiasy any inquiry concerning the truth of what I,
fay< I am. Sir, your grateful servant,

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
of
lia Debate in Foreign Intercourse.
[Continued from yesterday's Gazette.]
WEDNESDAY JANUARY 24.
Mr. Cr*ik. At thii ftige of ibe pÂ»efent debate,
and when I inform the Committee that I do mot ex
peÂ£k that any ebfervatiom which l ean oifer, will
make an imprtflion upon the Memberi, it might fce
expe&ed that 1 (bould make fomÂ« apology for rising
at thia time. 1 find an apology fufficieÂ»tly ftranj, in
the importance of the fuWjctt under difcuflion, and
in the conviftion that it i& my duty to take the most
public method of exprefTing my to ibe
principle contained in the present amendment. Were j
it not for these confederations, the present flatc of my
health would strongly forbid my mixiag ia the pre
sent debate.
Having been prevented by indisposition from bear
ing the whole of the debate upon the amendment
now under confederation, I am obliged to depend up
on the flitement which hai been given by tbe report
era of the debates, ai to a part, and particularly he
introduÂ£Ury observations of the gentleman from Vir
ginia, who brought forward the amendment which
has produced thia lengthy and piflionate debate. That
the debate-Oiould be lengthy and paftionalf, is matter
of no surprize. Had I been accufUmcd to look for
of consistency of public conduft in that g-ntteirian, I
or might, perhaps, have expected that as on a late and
important occasion, he exprefled such a strong desire
\ for harmony and unanimity, and urged in favor of a
poftponentem of' the difcuf&on, to a very distant day,
the cvilsthat were to be apprehended from the excite
â ment of pa(7ion and party warmth; I fay, Mr, Chair
d man, if I had calculated on the of what had
taken place, I might have exp<-Â£led ihat, on the mo
tion of the gentleman from South Carolina, to go in
to the coufideration of this bill, a motion for post
1 pooement to a future day would have come from the
member from Virginia ; or, that the present ?mcnd
u" ment would have been delayed to some fu'ure feflion,
when, in that [gentleman's opinion, tke danger Irom
>d irritation mighr be ItCs, or harmony and union not of
so much importance is at prelentâfor I will venture
de to (ay that the present amendment brought forward
et by that gentleman involves a principle, which, in its
y, very nature, is of'ali others the most likely to pro
to duce excitement in this House, to call forth crimina
et tions a*d recrimination-", to bring into aition all the
jn al pcrityof party, to set afloat all liiole p.fliong whfeb
0 Â£ hive so often agitated thii body, and, in Ihort, to pro.
0 f duce a political warfare of opinions, the most oppo
c- deep-rooted, fixed, and irreroncilcable. But
whatever change of'circumftances may havetaken place,
to reconcile the gentleman's change of opinion to him
lejf, as to the necefTity Â©f harmony, and |the danger
le of irritation, then and now, âI do not complain of
ie His want of forbearance on the present occasion ; nor,
l " notwithftandingthe profeffionb of a different disposi
tion, which have been made, am I at all (urprized at
d the avidity with which the prefemt opportunity has
been seized, not only to eftabliOi a'principle danger
ci otis to the very exifter.ee of the Government, but 10
t. indulge himfell, with those who thavc followed him,
t. in the most unmerited suspicions, cenfurc and crimi
g nation, only of the Executive, but of all those
> members Â«f this house, wl:o have diffiired with ilwm
& in their Political i'yllcm of aftion. I fay, Mr. Chair
man, I do i ot, nor I to CGJbplain. because I
am tree to confels that I ara one of those (perhaps
Â® one of a'cw) who have believed, at least for foine
time pift, that, frwm the state of party in this.house,
lit Je was to be cxpetffed from attempts at union and
harmonyâthat nothing was to be obtained by con
cellion : I have therefore resisted every temptation to
inaftion, from considerations of this kind ; and have
determined to do what I think the interests of my
-s country require, and that fp<Â»edily, so far as depends
n upon me, without examining how it may be received
by tbofe who generally differ from me in opinion. 1
5. have also said, Mr. Chairman, that I was not at all
d j/Vfat the amendment which is now brought for
d ward, nor at the obfervatioos by which it has been
d ' Produced and fupported t for when I take a ietra-

eriorts to establish a principle which, if supported
" by a majority of this House, and by the people our
contlituents, must inevitably, and in myjview of the
a fubjeft, very Ihonly, fuhvert or maierully change the
prelent eftablilhed government
il 1 his principle iuvolves, in my opinion, a very
v plain, obvious, and simple quefiion : Shall a majority
ot the House of Reprefenuiivej absorb and draw to
r itlelf all the power* of this s Â»vernment, which have
J been diflribuied into different channels, or depart
menu ; or (hall eachdepaiiment of the government
. be supported by the . hers in the exercise of its
coummnonal functions ? And is it not equally the
f duty ot a member of this house (o defend and protest
the other departments, whilst moving in their own
. appropriate spheres, as it is to maintain and (employ
that portion of po*er which the eonftitution has in
truded to them ? Thisisa question which, (hough re
peatedly fettled, so far as decision can avail to this
~ purpole, is )et one of the utmost imp, rtance, and
will continue to be, as long as it lhall L be open to dis
cussion i which 1 believe will be the cafe so lone as
the house 13 composed of its present members. This
principle is ore, among many others, the contest a
bout which ilrongly charafleriz s party in this house.

has prevailed in this House firce 1 have had a l ca t in it
and which, 1 trull, will continue to prevail as long as

do I beHce that much iÃipietfiou is mad; by it with
in these wa Is. But. lit'ie that bat recently taken
place could be intended tor memiert of this bofty ;
it is time therefore to follow it where it is dcligaed
â¢<JhaveaniflfiLiei.ee. Mr. Chairman, I wiih not to
anticipate a ciilis in our affjiri, which prefect appear
ance! !eem to pÂ»jic .iim it !ail approaching : Ihould it
arise, which I heaven to avert, it may be luch
as to call far all the energies and refnurcet of our
country. I( will be then of :Lie uimolf importance
that the Executive fliould potlcfs the confidence of (his
countrymen, and ihofe who have manifefled a readi
oefÂ» to exctt .he means of the government in i s de
fence, freed from the imputations Leaped on then.
I have already, Mr. Chairman, observed that
I canlSdered this amendment at involving the
fame principle which has molt
upon every ociifion which has prelected itfelf
' been contended lor with allthe unity and talents
of the patty, and that I corilidered it on;-, which
if eftabltfhed in (lie latitude contended for,
â would change if not deflrny the
l constitution under which we live, and which
we have (worn to support. Ihe firfl attempt
at the eftabliflinieiit of the right iu the house of
: . reprerlentatives under the appropriating power,
! to exercise an unreftraiiled dife'rrtion upon an
| act done by the executive, within the linÂ«ils and
under the authority of hit constitutional pow
. ' ers, was in the memorable cafe of the British'
â¢'treaty. On this orcafion, they contended for
' the right of defeating an ail of the president
â  i and senate, by withholding an appropriation ne
celTary to cariV it intÂ» cfi'etf. The next in
1 point of time, was on the mint eflabl.fhinent,
where after a law had parted, l'andlioned by all
the forms whieh theconltitution preferred, an
attempt was made to defeat its operation by
withholding the appropriation of money neceff
arv to ift execution.
A third and similar attempt was made to de
feat the execution of the law for the building
and equipping of the frigates. Another effort
was made I believe during the fame leGion, by
withholding an appropriation for Carry 1115 into
elFeit the law fixing the military eftabhfliment
of the United States so far as relative to a troop
of llOrfe. Now there was firll a fair attempt at
a repeal of the law so far as relative to this
â  repealing law paflVd both houses of
the legislature, and was sent to the president for
! hit cpnfiderationâ he returned it with his rea
j font of diftint, and there not being a con
i flitutionji majority iti itsfavor/it failed.
I having all, the stages which the
j comlitution requires, and hiving been weighed
and eonfidered, he feflfi of the legifl'ture waÂ»
fairly exprefled that the law authorising thit
troop of horse ftould not be repealed, but that
the troop Ihould continue : notwithstanding all
thin, and that it required two thirds of both
bramhes <,f the legislature in this situation of the
business to repeal the law, it was contended in
the house of representatives, that a bare majori
ty ef that body had the constitutional right of
defeatiug it hv withholding the appropriation
necefiary to support it, and an attempt was
made to that effeft.
The next memorable cafe is the one now un
der consideration, where an attempt it made to
break down, destroy and alter an eftabliftiment
made by the president of the United States, un
der authority given him by the Â»onftitutioD. â
I do not propose 10 trespass tipoa the time of
the committee by a separate consideration of
each nf those cases, because the house are already
in pofleffion of the debates upon them, and be
cause a very few plain and simple refleiliont
upon a colleilirs view of them, will show the
danger of thÂ« principle* which is the fame in
all of.them, when carried into practice, the use
which may be made of it, and the meant adopt
tiv"S^a; J :XS wan toVVreMeVt'of
the United States in evety cafe where in the
execution of his constitutional powers, he mnft
have money to give efle<sl to his aifltâif this
fame majority can defeat the operation of a law
solemnly fandlioned by the three branches of the
legislature, when that law (hall require money
for its execution (and ijioft laws of importance
are of this defeription), then fir, is every branch
of the government brought at the feet of a ma
jority of this house ? Away then with the boast
ed independency of the different departments ;
there is an and of that happy and wife distribu
tion of power, which 1 fondly hoped and fup-'
posed this conflitution pwfleflcdâthere is no
longer stability in our a<sls, there will be no long
er confidence or security 111 ou^government.â
In vain is it that the framers of our constitu
tion intended to give solemnity to our doings ;
in vain do we look for stability and wisdom in
the constitution of the senate, or energy, deci
sion and promptness in our executive ; they are
prostrated ; their powers all vanish at the magic
touch of the representative wand. But, Mr.
Chairman, ground so untenable, attempts lo
hardy, required every address and management
to fnppott them. The partizans of this inno
vation upon our constitution, have addressed
themselves to that natural tendency of alf pub
lic bodies, rather to increafc their power, than
befatisjied with what they constitutionally poff-
have endeavoured to enlist the peo
ple on their life, .by creating jealousies and ftif
picions of the executive,by attributing to the
departments different iHterefts and views
from those of the people ; they have endeavour
ed to impress them with an opinion, that what
ever power is taken from the other branches of
government, atul added to that of the houlif of
representatives, is so much regained to the pub
lic ftcckâevery attempt at reliftance to those
doilririet, whetherin thishoufe or out of it,i* char
ged either to executive influence or to political opi
nions, hodile to the representative and republi
can form of government. Mr. Chairman, it is
because those men are truly attached to the
d.ftribution of power under the present form of
government, because they are equally enemies to
anarchy and despotism, becaule they wifo to
preserve that balance and harmony which the
framers of the confti'ution intended it (hould
have, and to defend the whole, by giving each
part its power of atfionâl fay it is because
they are against any, the smallest chance, urilefs
efFefted in the constitutional mode, that they
differ with the mover 6f the present amendment,
and other gentlemen of this house, upon the pre
sent and other important occasions.
Though a member of the house of represen
tatives, I haÂ»e no particular attachment to any
one branch of the government compared with
another, nor do F believe that any one depart
ment of government is the peculiar favorite of
th* people. VVhatevi-r contrails may be drawn in
thiÂ« house betweea this branch and the other, I
trust tlit nature of bur government is better un
derstood u ithcur these walis. The people are
not now to be informed that all power emanatet
from tiiem, and however distributed, those unto
whom it is entrusted to be employed for the
public good, are responsible to them for the
proper use of it. They fee in the executive a
department as neceffarv as responsible, and
as mucfr entitled to their confidence and sup
port as any other in thÂ» government. They
have not created an office, and ele&ed a man to
fill it, for the purpose of making him theobjeft
of their lufpicion, fear, jealou'y and opposition.
Ir stead of authorising the house of representa
tives under the idea of checking his "evil pro
pensities, to thwart every measure that may
proceed from himâinstead of forming the hoife
of representatives into a court ps ceufors,or an in
quisition to pais upon the aÂ£U of the other-de
partments of the government, they have more
Wifely impolcd check l * in the vtrv constitution
of the departments themfeivrs âThey have in
the executive department, a security which can
not be abused, in the nianntr of his and
the time for which lie is elecled, In the high
refponfability of his fitua'ion, in being equally
the objeifl of p''nifhÂ»nent v. ith every other ser
vant of the public, in the importibilify, from his
ficuation and power, of having interefU didlintS
from the uula of citizens, into which he mail
fhnrtly returnâbut they have another, Mr.
Chairman, and n ; ;he-leatt imp-rtar.t; be must
be a native or a ci'izeti, prior to
the of the prclenbf o* ernment, and
therefore capable of taking a wirin interest in
the profpcriiy of his country, and feeling the
pride and inftusnce of the (rut American cha
raSer.
VCas a ftrangcr to our coffftitution ;nd form
of government to hear the repeated ouforva lont
in this house of executive influence, of Â»Se dan
ger of executive patronage, and the jeaioufies
expressed r f tbe abuse of power ; when he (hall
animated eloquence of ge tlemeu called j
forth (by a fonftitittinn'al ail of the p rfiJent in
the appointment of a foreign ininifter) to paint
in plowing colours the danger of hi 6 influence
and patronage being extended even to members
of th 19 house, I fay ffirh'a man, without any
other information, woufd naturally luppofe the
president to be feme despotic foreign viceroy,
entrusted with ahfolute power, and holding the
purse firings of the nation, feeling no attachment
to the people over whom he was placed, and
hiving norefponfibility attached tohij situation.
Wf.at, Mr. Chairman, would be hit furpdfe,
and to what would he attribute such conduCl,
when h; shall be informed of the real situation,
power and charafler of this man, when hefhali
be told that he is the representative of a free peo
ple, freely cliofen by them from the mass of ci
tizens, and feleiled for his virtue and talents.
Whe* once the executive of this country
lofet the confidence of the people, when once
they withdraw their support from him, there is
an end to it, and to the' government. That
the executive influence and patronage is to be
dreaded under this guverriment it too ridicu
lous forferiotis cÂ»nfiderationâlt Tll y be a fpee
â¢tre with which to frighten weak minds, to alarm
children, but can nevsr enter into the fears of
men of common sense. Gentlemen tnayfuppolV
it may answer their purposes, *f thereby t'n?y
can exyite an opposition in the house sup ported
by the people without, against the exercise of
executive power : with such an opposition, in
such a warfare, every other department of the
government mufl fall. Then indeed would the
house of representatives pofftfs u. ontrouled
power ; then it will have arrived to that tyran
ny which some gentlemen fay republican gov
ernment! have a tendency to ; then indeed will
the government bÂ« changedâbut from such a
government, and such a tyranny, I pray hea
ven to defend me.
But, fir, why the present alarm, why this
hostility against tbe executive upon the pre
sent oecafion. Yes, the executive does more
in thisinftance than the constitution hat au
thorized him to do. Are we qualified to
fay, he has unwisely exceeded the power
intruded to him, have we the infor
mation necefiary to form an opinionâmay
there not be information which we do not
possess, and may it not be improper in the
President to furnifh us with itâ(hall wc de
cide blindfold, or the President, to whom
the conftitutioÂ» has given the right having
decided frum alljthe information before hinu_
mmi vÂ»c n.jrpole tnatto oe rigfttjufly doae
which is conjlitutionally done. -If the house
has a right to determine there (hall be no fo
reign ministers, they have a right to deter
mine there Jhall be foreigners, how many,
and where. Is the executive in that cafe
bound to take their advice, if lie is, may
this house not as well fay what those minis
ters (hall do. This house has the power of
refufing the necefiary appropriations ; have
they the canjlitut'tonal right ? The President
of the United States is a ceriftitutional of
ficerâthis house rauft furnifli his fupportâ
they may suppose this officer pofieffes power
dangerous to the liberties of thishoufe and
to the peopleâthey have the power to re
fufe an appropriation. No man will be har
dy enough to contend we have the constitu
tional rightâthe fame of the judges who
are created by law and appointed by the
Presidentâhere the legislature adi under the
exprefii authority of the constitution and
create the officer j can this house refufe
rightfully, to appropriate for their sup
port ? So in the present cafe the President
is a constitutional officerâhe is directed by
the constitution to appoint foreign minillers;
it is as if the constitution had _appoinÂ«Â»d"
'.hem l'tl'clf. Here, as in the cafe of the judg
es, is no authority given to the legislature to
create those officers. The right is in strong
terms taken from the legislature. To have
the right to make foreign ministers or to
displace them, we must have the right of
foreign correspondence and the fuperintend
ance of ot our foreign relations or how can
we judge of the fitnefs or unfitnefs of the
measure j we must alfojudge of the propri
ety of making treaties since they will re
quire ministers to make themâwill those
powers be contended for? But here is an of
ficer appointed to an office not created by
lawâit is now proposed to recal or difplaee
him ; can this be done but by the fame au
thority that appointed him. The appropri
ation was fixed by law, the officer was cre
ated by the President âthe President -who
judged of hi 3 appointment, must judge of
his recal.
It has been insinuated in the course of the
debate, that the executive had exprefied an
opinion ;hat the right of creating the offi
ces of foreign ministers, &c. was ip the le
giflatnre. I fee nothing to juftify this
conclusionâThe prarSMce of the executive
from the commencement of the government
to tbe present day, has been expressly a
gainst a concession of this right : and the
pra&ice of the legislature has been equally
opposed to the claim. Can gentlemen (how
an inltance where the legislature have crea
ted an office of this kind ? Has not the u- .
niform practice of the executive been, to
appoint to offke, and then call upon the
house not for a creation of the office, but
for an appropriation for the officer* In the
late million to Paris, did the executive con- 1
fultt'nis house before he made the appoint- ;
men'., to know whether we would have
one or three commissioners ? And was his
v right to determine that question disputed,
when we were called upon to appro-Â». ..
for three commissioners ? Is it prop.,!,-; l (
qutftion rtiis right which the Prefid.ut h i
thought himfelf authorised to execute, du r
ing the present session, in the appointment
of three commissioners to treat with the
Cherokee Indians ? The appointment has
been made without confulring us ; au] {
have not supposed it would be disputed, or
the appropriation.
But as some extra&s from the speeches
of members formerly of this houle were
read to the committee, by the mover of the
amendment, with a view to (how, as I un*
derftand, that the ground now contended
for by the opponents to the present amend
ment, was not taken early in the govern
ment. And as the gentleman from Virgin
ia (Mr. Brent) has expressed great uneafi
nets and alarm to find from the reading of
these extradi*, that the opinions now ex
prefled by some gentlemen, are but of a
late date, that they have changed with a
change of views, and that there fnotild be
such a want of consistency in their conduft.
I /hall beg leave in concluiion to read to
this committee a few extrafts from the con
gressional register of the debates and pro
ceedings in the iirft congress, as a compleat
refutation of those insinuations. As I was
not in the house when the txtrafts were of
fered by the mover of the amendment, and
they were not printed with his obfervationi;
I have not had opportunity of examiu
ing them. Those, however, which I (hall
offer, are diredlly to the point; and prove
inconteftably, that the present question was
fettled early in the government, in the firft
cafe in which it arose ; and that if there iÂ»
any inconsistency of conduct .in gentlemen,
upon the present fnbjeft, it rattier attache
to those who have since contended for the
right now claimed. Mr. Craik then read
the extract of the proceedings and debate
on a bill brought into the-boufe of repre
feutatives, for making provision for the de
fraying of expences attending Indian trea
ties j which bill contained a clause dire<3in e
that commissioners, not exceeding* three
(hould be appointed, and allowed compen
fat.on, &c. When the bill came under the
consideration of the house, a member, Mr.
Sedgwick, made a motion to strike out
that part of the clause, restrain ing the num
ber of commissioners to three, on the ground
that it was an unconstitutional interference
on the part of the house, with the execu
tive authority ; that the right of layW
how many commissioners there should be an
pointed, belonged to the executive alone ;
and that this house have nothing to do with
it. The question for striking out the clause
after debate, wai carried. Mr. Ctailc ob
served, that the mover of that amendment,
for "striking out the clause, was well known
to have always maintained a steady and a
n-iform opinion upon this fubjeft ; and Mr.
Craik observed he was authorised to fay,
that a member then from Virginia (Mr.
Maddifon) whose opinions the fupporteri
of the present amendment, generally ref
peftive, seconded the motioÃ of Mr. ScAo
vyidt- jthirh was then the fubjed of If
of the debate where Mr. Smith, eftâ¢ ,
member of the house, when faking upon
the question, asked the house, " what was
to be done, the United States
Were at war with a nation from whom over
tures of peace were receivedâSuppose it
was absolutely necefiary during te
cefs of congress, to lend a minitUr or an
envoy to theDeyof Algiers; wouldilbe
proper to delay so necefiary a bulinefs, un
til this house would be convened. ?"
Mr. C. observed, the extradt of the law,
and debate thereon which he had used, re
quired no comments, but he would propoft
the fame question now, which was then put,
for the consideration of the committee.
Mr. C. cancluded with an expression of his
decided and unequivocal, opposition to the
amendment under discussion : observed his
strength was sxhaufted, but not the fub
je6t.
Shall (hen tliofe who resist this tyranny
be branded with the charafter of men wish
ing to extend the executive power to the
dertrudlion of all others ? Shall they bein
| ceffantly tatlw -jwoplÂ«, a<t 'Â» < S' n g
! executive influence, as being the
mouth of ths executive, as being the part
ners and champions of executive power
And shall they be sarcastically called the he
roes of the constitution ? Is this a fit time
to defeminate jealousies and suspicions of
this kind against the executive ? ArÂ« the
best talents of the country to loose their ef
fedl from inculcating an opinion that ;thcfe
efforts are produced by the influence of ex
ecutive patronage ? And shall every man
who happens to think with the exeentive,
in the proper mode of administering this
government, if he has talents fufficient to
attention, be eonfidered as a candi
date for public office ; or taking measures
to promote his eleftioa ? These are not im
aginary charges ; for the gentleman from
Pennsylvania (Mr. Gallatin) mult excuse
my BOt considering his jcfuitical explana
tion, the other day, as fufficieut to take of
the impression whiish the whole tenor of hi*
observations would ueceffarily make. If he
believed them'ifchiefs which he apprehended
from executive patronage, and of its being
used with effeft upon this house werÂ« dif
taut, why oppose the pr<feÂ»t bill on tfa'.s
ground, which does not contemplate an tn
crtafe of patronage ? And why charge the
executive with making appointments from
the legiflattire ? Why talk of gentlemen in
this house having commiffibns in their pack
ets ; or the expectation of office, wnill ad
vocating measures wh'ch we * to make way
for the appointment r And why ge intÂ« a
nice calculation of time between a former
apDropriatiÂ»n and the appointment to offi-e
of a member of this house ? No man who
heard that gentleman's observations,. Â»t>
man who read; them in the public prints,
can doubt of the effsft they were intended
to have. They ought not, therefore, to
have paÂ£ed unnoticed. But where arc the
loaves and fiihes which are supposed to hej the ha;ids of th; ?x:ca'fvc? j 1
r Prdiufent mud have the power of a
rniraci.-s with, them as of old, if in j t!
their distribution more ftionld full to the ti
share any public officer than is pecefTary b
forn bare fubfiftencf. . 1
Ido no\ undertake to determine, nor do n
I thiok it at this time, and in tliu o
place, to efrprefs an opinion upon the gepe- d
ral queftioti of the policy of this govern- t
ment in maintaining a political connexion (
with the other nations of the world, or of n
the propriety of an extension or reduction a
of our prefeni diplomatic -establishment, be- n
â¢ cause Ido not Wlieve I poffels all the infor- o
illation neceffnry to a correct opinion upon 1
the fubj*Â£t; and because such opinion could f
oolySLe conflJiered as that of aoy other in- e
ualof the community, and should have i r
no efiLcl as coming from me in my reprefen- i
tative chara&er. I believe the constitution t
has given to the Executive the right to de- j=
cide upon this fubje<ft : the President can t
have the best. advice of the nation, and will, j c
jio doubt take it; if he shall at any time be 1
of opinion with this ad-vice, and all the in- I
formation before him, which his conftituti- r
onal character fvjrnifhes him with, that the s
the country will be promoted by t
a reduction of thcdiplomatic establishment; i
as he has the right, so I believe he will be dif- ;
pr fed to exercise it. A s the people of the I
Unitefl States, and myfelf among the num- 1
btr have thought he,cculd be fafely truftcd i
with the exercise of this right, lam not 1
disposed in this exparte manner to question ;
either his wisdom <>r integrity, by withdraw- <
jng'my support from him. i
Nor do I consider it necefiary on this oc- 1
cafmn, to vindicate him againfl a charge of i
a supposed resolution on his part to elect to
office only such men as ffeall in the general '
accord with him in opinion, as to the belt
rri<*leof ?dniiniftering the government: be
cause I do not consider that such a refoluti
tion. If adopted, requires defence, inasmuch
as 1 believe it would be juftified by common
sense, common prudence, and common ex
perience. Nor can I adrrÂ«t that the suppos
ed difficulties which have been suggested by
gentlemen in this debate, viz. the mem
ber from New-York (Mr. Livingfton) and
the member from Virginia (Mr. Brent) are
objections to the adoption of fuph a resolu
tion, if indeed, I believed that the time
would shortly arrive, when the Executive
should be reduced ta that situation for want
of talents or integrity, among those who
generally approve of the measures of gov
ernment. as to compel him either to make
the felc&ion to office from a contrary de
scription of character as tQ political opinion,
or as the member from Virginia(Mr. Brent)
has expressed himfelf, to hoist into office
demagogues, who have no other recommen
dation thart their madness on all occafioÃS,
tofing Hallelujah's to Executive power and
influence, I should consider such an event
much to be deplored; then, indeed, should
1 I be willing to give some force to those ob
jeftions, but as I wish not unncceffarily to
d diltrefs myfelf, I shall not anticipate an evil
â¢ which I'believe to be as noil.asrer.
"""â¢fiTotcTs "it Prions and alarming :f
at hand.
Nor, Mr. Chairman,- do I think the gen
tleman from Virginia (Mr. Brent) has been
very fortunate in the choice of character
which he has made to invalidate the truth of
an observation which has been frequently
made, viz. that the Executive had in no in
stance deviated from such rule,in the appoint
ment to office without having melancholy
cause to lament it. As this gentleman has
thought fit to bring more immediately into
view thise'eharafler, which he fays is well
kn< wn, to have been frequently alluded to,
during the present debate, I thereto might
, fafely concede all that he has intended for
him on this occasion, without being con
sidered his patiegyrift: I might admit with
much tr/ith, that we owe our present fituati
oii with the French republic to that gentle
man, and if it will be any gratification to
the member from Virginia (Mr. Brent) or
those who have purfned the fame political
ine of conduct, I am willing to allow them
a participation of those measures which have
produced this situation. If this situation
is as the gentleman from Virginia bis insinu
ated an enviable one, if it is one on which
wt have abundant caufeto felicitate ourselves
f then, Sir, I agreethey Shall have all thecre
dit which their efforts so well entitle them
to: if, on the contrary, this situation is such
as every friend to the interest, the honour,
and the peace of the nation has reason to la
ment; then will I not dispute with them the
obloquy and censure which their conduct
may juflly merit. This is a question which
I undertake not to decide, in the language
of the member.from Virginia (Mr. Brent),
I leave it to the underfta'nding and feelings
of the country to determine.
Whilst taking notice of the observations
of the gentleman rromVirginia (Mr. Brent)
I cannot omit observing upon the unfair
statement he has made of the remarks of the
member from Conneftictit (Mr. Grifwold)
uponthe fubjeftof checking thegovernment.
If I underltood that gentleman, the dittinc
tioh which he took between the system of
the metnber from Virginia and his own, was
clear, explicit and intelligent: he admitted
that checks were to be found in our
merit, but that they were checks operating
within each.department, he dented that the
departments were checks upon each other;
and he went on to exemplify and explain his
his didinction in a manner which could not
be mifiwder flood, but by thd*onfufed ideas
of gentleman upon the fuhjeft. He
contended for inftanee, that the lcgiflative
department had constitutional checks with
in itfeif; that the house of representatives
was- a check - upon the Senate, the Senate
n check upon the house of representatives, j
and the President, who in this refpedt |s a
conftituentpart of the legiflaturehas a check
ppon both : that in theexecutivedepartment
the Senate was a check upon the President.
Buthedenied that the legislative department
was a check upon the executive, the execu
tive Bfon the legillatite, or either upon the
â¢ r
juJi' i iry. Hii ideas upon this fubjeft I will ! n
admit were very different from those of gen- j if
tlemen who advoCnted theextraordinarydoc- , a
trine of checks, introduced into this debate |
by the mover of the present amendment.â I
The checks contended for by those gent'e- )
men are intended to produce an eternal state j..
of wjarfare and holility between the several
departments of the government, that coo- .
tended for by the member from Copnefticut 1 P
(Mr. Grifwold) is designed to promote har- â¢ c<
mony and a co-operation of the departments:
according to those gentlemen's system, the U
moment of harmony, conciliation and uni- < 0
on is the moment of danger and alarm.â
That moment the government is in such. a ! v .'
situation as that it can aft with any valuable 1
efFeft, is the time to fonn'd the alarm, is the
moment for this minority to exert themselves j
ir> ffarriog up intern*) war and difleution in \ F
i the departments. It I Relieved with the ;
gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Nicholas) j r<
i that foch must be the eperatior of republi- ! f
, | can governments, I fhculd then agree with 13
â  him most readily in another opinion which t(
he has exprefTed, that republican govern- \
- mcnts had a strong tendency to despotism
: and tyrannyj for I willventure to aflert, that
r out of such confufion, such disorder, such a e
; warring and hostility of departments either '
- anarchy or defpetifm must ntceffarity and u
s ihortly arrive. But, Sir, I fear there is but
- little probability of the appiehenfion of the "
i member from Virginia being realized in that
t harmony, union and po-operation of thede
ii partments' which I consider so desirable in 0
- our government, and so necefTary to its ufe
ful operatian, so long as he shall be a mem- j;
- ber of either of the departments. Accord
s ing to his own principles it will be his duty P
dUo keep a watchful eye upon their approach '
il to this point, and to found the alarm: and 8
,t though he should be one of the virtuous mi- *
oority in this house, I have no doubt but he 1
i- is fufticieatly known out of this hoCife'tp at- 1
b trait attention, and that he will speak loud ,
n etioHgh to be heard at lead by the minority
- out ftfthofe walls. If I couldfee strong and
["- alarming fyrnptoms of a harmony of this c
y house with the Executive department at thrs
â¢ time, I might be able to account for the a
d laendment which is now under consideration
e and the style of the observations with which 1
- : t was introduced, I might in that cafe, be i
e j able to uriderftand why the house of repre- I
e fectatives is thus to be drawn up in battle j
t array against the Executive.
o I wiU now noticrs a few of the remarks 1
r- of the gentleman front Pennsylvania, who
e was last up (Mr. Findley) and then con- '
elude. This gentleman, in the commence- f
i, ment of his speech, complains mush of the '
) personalities of some members of this house
e in the present debate, and of the hard naÂ«;es '
i- that have been called: and he beginsand fin- I
i, ifhes this fame speech in 3 stile of abuse and 1
d crimination, but little calculated to corredt 1
t the michief he complains of. He said in
d one breath, that the favorers of the present '
i- amendment, are reprefeneted as vvifhing to 1
o overturn the government, and in the next, '
il he afierts it is well knewn that there are men 1
in tlvis house, who consider the executive the
f government, and he attributes the obiervati- 1
ons of some gentlemen to their profeffional '
i- habits at county court bars ; from the pro- '
n ficiency which tbis and some other gentlemen '
:r have discovered upon the present occasion '
jf in this stile of declamation I am induced to
y believe there, are other schools besides caun
l- ty cpurts where language of this kind is '
t- taUgnt. â¢ )
y But, Sir, this gentleman has made ano
js ther complaint, which rathei defems to be ;
o laughed at than seriously attended to ; it is, j
11 that we have taken up much time in difput- |
3, ing about a principle when we ought only to :
it havfc considered the expediency of the mea
jr fures proposed, and he has insinuated this as
i- a usual trick with some gentlemen in this ;
h house. I consider this attempt to trepan the ;
i- house, and lead from the real question, as a j
e- trick indeed, but a very (hallow one. Does
:o the gentleman preitend that the principle in j
ar this cafe must, be fettled before we can come â 
al to the expediency of the measure, and that ;
m any discussion of the expediency j
ire denial of the principle is an express admission
in of the principle? That to admit the right
n- of :he house of representatives to legislate
;h or del/beTate upfitrtheexpediency of thepre
cs lent rncafirre, is to concede the principle
e- contended for, in all its latitude. Ido not
m be'icv the movtrof the present amendment
â¢h or tlicfe who immediately followed him in
r, mpport of it, from the ground which they
a- then took, and the full disclosure they made
it of those objedts and intentions for which I
Ct am willing to give them credit will thank
:h those gentlemen who would now reduce the
Â£e question to a mere nothing. Has the pre
), sent amendment ever been contested upon
gs this ground, snlefs by those two gentlemen?
Has the right which they claim everbeen de
ns nied? if it haslhave not heardit âhavethofe
t) whofupporttheprefent amendment,pretend
ir edthat the allowances which have heretofore
le been made to oilr foreign ministers have
!) been too high ? Do they wish that a min
t. ifter plenipotentiary or charge des affairs,
c- should have less ? I have not heard i r con
of tended, but the objeft is profeffed to be,
as by reducing the appropriation, to reduce
:d the grade of office at two of the courts,
n- and to compel the President to recall the
ig ministers at another, and not to reduce the
ic appropriation, because the present allow
r; ances to the-fecond grade of officers is too
is high, and ought Bo be reduced. It has
Dt been explicitly avowed, that-it is further
as irttended by degrees to destroy entirely, our
le diplomatic establishment. But fir those
ve gentlemen cannot be serious in their declar
h- ations upon this fubjedt, for they have both
es contended ( notwithstanding this declaration'
te of their view of the fubjeft) with all their
s, talents, for the establishment of the very
a principle which the oppofers of the amend
:k fhent fay it involvesâOne other objeft may
nt be obtained by thus weakening the impor
t. tsnee of the present dispute, to wit im
nt pressing the people with an opinion that
u- the opponents to the amendment have pro
he duced an Hunecelfary waftt of time and 1
I rr.oney, which would be iadwd inexcusable ' cr.
if tliccontrS was ti'is-faving of afi

I give them full fatij>faÂ£tion, and thereby pre-
Tent further applications, he hoped, the de- m|
. termination made upon it, might be done in
'â  the most solemn manner.- a Â£
j Mr. Sitgreaves hoped 4 this cotirfe would
be taken. He wished the themorialifts to
be fu'ly fcitislied with the proceedings taken t0
3 oa their application. mi
s Mr. T. Claiborne was also of this opini- 'h
on.
! Mr. M'Dowell could not conceive the ar
objett of the gentleman who moved this re- ha
. pert to be committed, except it were to pe
pay a compliment to the memorialists.
c He was opposed to paying this compliment. .
He thought the manner in which they had w
s so frequently come forward to attempt tode- th
3 fturb the peace of society, and to arraign fi<
the condu&of the Hate governments,was not ! w
. entitled to it. He hoped, therefore, the t[)
e repÂ»rt would not be referred. jp,
e The question was put, and there appear- ar
s ed to be 35 for the emmraitting the report,
and 35 afainftit; the Speaker determined nt
jin the affirmative, and the question car- of
tried. Pc
tl Mr. Dwight Foster, from the" committee d
t of claims, to whom was referred the refolu- 11
0 tion requiring a report 011 the propriety of
extending the aft paflVd June 7, to! rc
n making further provisions for the more ef

!_ Mr. N- Smith prefeated the following re
;s solution : t) .

t ! vered by citizens of the United States un- t ,
t _ der the treaty made with great Britain,

t f ually decided upon by the court of ap-'â 
lt ; peal." ! 0
; 3 i Mt. Jofiah Parker also ptefented the sol- 1 0
; lowing: j [ (
a ' " Resolved that the President of the U- ;tl
, s ; nited States be requested to direst the pro- p
n | per officer to lay before this house, a copy 11
le j of an aft of the Eritilh governmeitt counter
lt ! vailing the duties on tonnage laid on foreign t ,
a j ships and vessels by the United States, and a
Â»n goods, wares and merchandize imported p
lt therein." v
, e Both resolutions were ordered to lie 011
c _ the table. â¢ n
j The houfeagain resolved itfelf into a com- v
3t mittee of the whole on a bill enabling the *
)t President to hold a treaty with the Indians 11
j n claiming lands in the state of TennelTee; Mr. (]
, v Gallatin proposed an amendment fixing the
pay of the commissioners at eight dollars a f<
I day, exclusive of their expences, which was n
ageeed to. And, on motion of Mr. M'Dow- 0
e ell, the words "or North-Carolina," were
e _ moved to be added after the word Tenneflee f
)rl so as to enable the President to treat for any
n j land belonging to the Indians within that a
a * state. The motion rtas agreed to, 43 to 16. f
j* e The house agreed to the amendments, and
j the bill was ordered to be read a third time c
re to-morrow. t
ve A meflage was received from the Prefi-
n _ dent of the United States, informing the r
s house that he had approved and signed the [
n ] aft for amending the several afts for laying t
a duty on fpints and dills. t
c ' e Mr. Sitgreaves moved, that the unfini(hed ,
5 business relative to foreign intercourse (hould J
; g be poftpoaed, in order to take up the arti- ,
rie cles of linpeachment reported agaiaft.Will
iam Blount. '
1
jo Mr. Harper hoped the unfinished bufi
as ness would not be poftpoced for this pur- |
er pose, asjie wished it firft to be disposed of. 1
ur Mr. Sitgreaves said, he made this motion, '
fe because of the impatience which had been '
ir- heretofore fhewrl to go into the business,
th and because he believed it would not require
an much time. He also thought it would
:ir be proper to exhibit the articles to the Se
ry nate at as early a period as polfible, as there
d- would be certain preliminary questions to be
ay decided fore the impeachment could be pro
)r- ceeded withâhe alluded to the impeacha
m- bility. of a Senator, which he imderftood
,at the Senate meant to dilpute. If the Senate
o- determined that one of their body is nat
nd impeachable, the business would be at an
er.d. Tl.i< qu -.lion would be entered upon fit
ifter the articles were exhibited. He ha- ro
ped.therefore,'the house would take up the "
3'ifinefs. thi*.titnr, as the evidence had *
aeen long in the hands of the members, the
"nbjeft mu.t be well understood. It would
>e seen that the articles were predicated up
jn the tingle letter of William Bkmnt to
[ames Carey, which was communicated to
he house by the President of the United
St&tes.
Mr. M'DoiveU supported the motion. (e(
Mr. Macon was opposed to it, wiihed L]
he unfinifhedbufinefs firft tobegone through ac
â¢ Mr. Sprigg was io favour of the motion. erj
doubt had arisen whether the trial could
;o on in the absence of the person impeach
d. If this should prove to be the cafe, it
vould be necessary to fend a meflengerto
renneffce, and wait Tilsreturti. The sooner,
herefore, the business could be gpne into
he better. j- c ,
Mr. Thatcher thought there was no ne
effity immediately to proceed to consider
he articles irv question as he found by a rp
>ill before him, that the Senate confidsred
t necefTary to pass a bill before they enter
â d upon the business, prescribing the mode
>f proceedirrg in cases of impeachment. th
Mr. Gordon thought the remark of the at
rentleman last up was not entitled to any >' e
weight ; if it were, the Senate might pre
renttheim'peachmentaltogether. Hethpught
he observation of the gentleman front Mary- g(
and (Mr. Sprigg) was worthy of coniidera- j .
ion. The preliminary question m
ie believed would) be made whether a
Senator was impeachable. If the Senate de
eded one of their body was not impeacha- t0
jle, the business would be an end ; if not,
't might be neceflary to iflue process to call
the person impeached before them, and it
might'be necelfary to piotraft their session,
for the purpose of finifhing the business ; ai
after it was gone intp, it would, not be pro
per to leave it in an unfinifhtd state.
Mr. Coit wished the articles not to twtakan up
to day, as they were Â»n'y laid upon the table this
morning, aiul he had had fearcely tine to
them
Mr. Harper did not think the business would
come to n earlier termination by goin, into ths
articles to-day, as a committee of the house would
have, to go to the Senate to argue the point of im
peachabiltty with them.
Mr. Sitgreaves thought differently ; for, though
the managers on the part of tha house rnuft be h_-ard
in the Senate, before the question of impeachability 1,1
wÂ»sdeÂ«ided, yet the Senate could not proceed on r <
the fubje& befere the articles were cxh hited Be-
fides, if the matter of fatft came to be tried, it
would be necÂ«ffary for fc'veral witnefles to be sum
moned from the slate of TennefTee, in addition to
ths evidence already obtained. It jvould not ke
proper, therefore, to delay an exhibition of the d
articles. p
The question for postponing the unfinifhedfcnfi- ei
ness was put Â»nd carried 41 to 41.
The house then refolve"B itfelf into a committee
of the whole on t*e articles of impeachment re
ported against William Blount, Mr. Dent in the
chair ; when they were read as follows. [See Sa
turday's Gazette.]
The articles having been agreed to, without a
mendment (except a mere verbal one) the committee
rose, and the house having a If* agreed to them,
Mr. Sitgreaves moved that managers be appoin- J
ted i"*- the part of the house for the purpose of t'
conducing the impeachment. 1
Which being agreed to, ii
Tha Speaker enquired of what number they e
fflculvi vVl((l<t7 t<
IVfr- Sitgreaves anftrcred eleven, S
Mr. Thatcker five.
Mr. Sitgreaves hoped the number he hal men- tl
tioned wouki Â«e agreed to; the business bÂ«ing new,
and oi a very important and doiicafe nature, he
thought the managed ought not: to be less than e
leven.
Mr. Thatcher withdrew fris motion, ani eleven
was agreed tq be the number.
Mr, Sitgroaves moved that the rtliinagers go to
the Senate with the articles of imbeaxhTnent
, Mr. VSuabJe wished to know how the managers
were to be appointed.
Mr .Sitgreaves Taifll, with r#fpecl to the manner
of appointing managers, he left it to the discretion
of the houie. The iiritifh houle of commons ap
pointed their managers of impeachment by bal
lot, as they did all their large commit .vs. fn
that houf.- a different courl'e was taken,.with ref
peA to committers ; they were always appointed
by the Speaker, except specially ordered other-
wife. The former committee on thisbufinef. wer*
appointed by the Speaker He was not
to deviate from the usual practice-. If, however u
any gentleman wiihed to move that they be ap- tl
pointed by ballot, such a motion, he supposed, u
wculd in fx der.
Mr. Venable did not think the house had any
rule on the fubjed:. The rule for appointing com
nnttecs did not apply to the prefsrot cafe, which J
was perfedly new. Bethought, therefore, that a j
vote of the house ought to deter cnine in what man
ner the managers should be appointed. He had
no objeAion to the Speaker's appointing them, if v
the house should so determine. ' ri
Mr. Thatcher did not think there was any dif- c
ference betwixt there managers, and other com-
mittses of the house, and, ihereforc, could fee no
Ã¼bjedlion to chufnig them in the usual mode.
The Speaker reid the rule, and said managers of
conference with the Senate were chofeo in the r
fame way. " f
Mr. Gallatin thÂ®Hght the rule of dire&ing the
appointment of committees did not apply in the
present e*fe. It was true that manager* of confer-
Senate were thus chosen ; but he tho't
there was an efientiai difSTerente betwixt the two
cases. of conferences reported to the
house similar if with committees, and in fa A they
were a committee, thotigh railed by a different
name. But managers of an impcaclnrent on the
part of that appeared to him to be quite a
different thing They were not to make a report
to the house which might be affirmed or negatived ;
they were the representatives of the houÂ£e, and
what they did would be final. Under this impres
sion, in order to take the sense of the house upon ,
the business, he moved that the managers be eledl
cd by ballot.
The motion was carried wirhÂ©*:t a division, and
the members were proceeding to'prepare their bal
lots *, when
Mr.ffaac Patkerfajd, a* he was dot prepared tÂ« -
give his vote, not being fuffuiently acquainted with \
the member* ro know who ware the molt fit to be
managers, he should move that the appointment
of managers, be poflponcd till to-B:orrow ; which
motion was carried.
The house then after a further vote to poflpone
the unfinifhed bufincf*, rsf-tved itfelf into a som
mittee q,f the whole on the report of the commit
tee of claims on the petition of Mary Clark, who
prayed for the reimburfiment of the lurnol Â£.7,2.
