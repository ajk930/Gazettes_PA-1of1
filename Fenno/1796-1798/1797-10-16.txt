the interested and the deligning are busy in
blowing up the embers of discord. Thij 1
spirit has at length found its way into col- (
leges and'academie9 of fcieuce, into those in- '
ftitutions which ought to be the repositories
of philosophy ; where youth are, or ought 1N
to be, trained up to become the lights of ,e
the world, and qualify thtofelyes to forward 0
that great principle of humanizing, civiliz- Â£
ing and harmonizing a race too naturally
prone to discord aÃd to render each Other's
(ituation uneasy on this earth. In several
late college exhibitions in the different S P
states, the pupils have spoken their fenti- .

i qualified acrimony, against that enlightened c ]
. natiorf, whiqh founding heroifrtxon the prin

daily prompts the fool to fay in his heart, 1
there is iro God. It is in vain for these gen- S
tlemen to hope, at the present crisis of
things, to set the American tiation at enmi
ty with France. The republican spirit is
peace, harmony, and good will among men.
n The sentiment of America must operate con-
genially with that of France, in order to
confront the demon of monarchy, and drive
hira to his native obfeurity. Ye precep-
tors, ye fathers of colleges, who pofTefs sen
timents unfriendly to the rights of man, in- |

feelings of your audiences, by making inno-j

HeARSY, &C. VS. SwAtiSON. NoW <
This was an adtion upon a policy of in- tion oi
furauLT to recover the fubfcunjtioti on a (hip teral j
bound from Lifbou to London, in the courf* prize I
of which voyage (lie was captured by the the lai
enemy. fubfilt
Mr. Law Hated the cafe on the part of
the plaintiff. He said, that the adtion was court
brought upon the policy underwritten on the that t
{hip Commerce, which failed on the 14th of nio C
â¢ March from Lisbon. On the 17th (he was Amer
visited by a French (hip ; her papers being' were r
examined, (he was allowed to proceed ; b'Jt hadnc
â¢ (he had not proceeded long before (he was confe
1 taken a second time' and carried into l'Ori- ter ac
- ent, and was totally loft to the owner, fne that (
; V.'ing condemned, together with her cargo, ter, t
!. as prize to the enemy. The only question (hew
would be, whether (he was or was-not an A- corvh
â¢ merican veflel ? If (he was, (he was entitled re put
Ito all the rights of neutral nations, and as laid,
I such came under the rule of law as a subject to fh
. of insurance, and the underwriters were lia- from
I ble for thelofs. In order to (how that (he thift
g I was an American veflel, it would appear be- right
- } fore the jury that the captain had his letter M
i-l of naturalization on board, and a rcgifter ?if duce
n the United States of America, dated in tenci
[ r I 179 1. Hfc understood it wa6 to be con
e tended that the register was not renewed gefte
1-1 within 3 years, and that therefore it was was
y void. He found no such proyition in the The
rs laws eÂ£ America ; besides, thia (hip had not hira
a- I been in a situation to renew her reglfter in thor
ie j America. It wai an American veflel, built this
n-1 of American materials, and as fully entitled the
e, j to the protection of neutrality as any vessel . prov
in could be. He really did not know what j I
li- I the poihts were on which the defendants . the
n. reftedjtfieir cause ; if they had any, it was , por.
he I enough for his client in this action tnat the . iucl
j (hip was an American (hip, built of Ame- 1 of
I rican materials, and that the capt. was an seal
ve 1 American fubjeft by virtue of naturalization; al w
as I that he and the (hip were captured by the jeÂ£i
le- I enemy, and the (hip and cargo condemned per
lot las prize to the enemy. All these points wit
jc-1 were fufficient to entitle the plaintiff to re- lie
es, cover the fubfeription money, which was the
Ve one hundred jfotind. P"
;he Mr. Antonio Caftize said he was com- pol
we mander of the (hip Commerce, in March coi
>ne last. That he failed on the Bth of March alf<
from Liflxm. That he was a native of Ven- re<Â£
I ice, naturalized m America. That he had otl
' I letters of naturalization, but the Frencb took vac
ife, J them from him when the (hip was captured, lea
un- These documents never were returned to up
VTi*. him. That on the 17th of March he was po:
lole taken by the French while'on his voyage mi
iy'B from Li(bon to London- K# was released he
saw on the 2lft, but taken again and carried to hit
Mr. ' l'Orient, when tht French took from him as
>me ' all his papers. That he had an American to
â¢ead veflel before this which he exchanged for
toe- this. The papers belonging to both were
on board this, and the French took them ag
all, arid never returned him any. 1 hat he pe
ain- was made prifojier at l'Orient, and that th
orn- while he was in confinement a perlon came it
f of to him faying, he was authonfed by the of
was fleers of the' Province to give him a paper, th
that which he produced in court, which paper A
hit. contained the condemnation of the (hip
Commerce, as prize to the French Republic. tl
E. Mr. Efkriue stated for the defendant,who w
nder was his own fruiterer, and who wa6 interfiled d
;n a- in the voyage in question ; and in the course 1
fe of of the market of these articles there was a 1
:mp- great fluctuation, particularly in time of war; tl
mts, when a number of vessels came home toge- c
>ws : thcr, the price of the market fell. In the v
interval, before the coming of convoy, to c
tand protect another fleet from the lame place, p
open the price of the market fell again. It. was, r
,vith- therefore, of great advantage in this trade, f
it to to bring over the cargoes previous to the p
fthe general arrival of the (hips under convoy, t
plain But if any person wished to run over a (hip n
Te to without convoy, the premium was un'ufually c
lam high, and such as trade would hardly bear, t
and therefore a great numher of (hips were c
employed as neutral because the underwri- t
â r. terst will underwrite them at a lower pretrii- <
it,' of um. Such vessels as that which was now in c
elub question, were picked up by merchants, and i
â n fell they pretended to-be neutral. This captain, 1
ityof who had stated himfelf to be a Venetian, 1
such might as well have lent his veflel to the
f two doge of Venice to wed the Adriatic as to
fuffer call upon the,defendant to answer in this ac
who tion.âlt was stated, th,at the only question
ncom- would be. in this cafe whether the veflel was
an ea- or was not an American veflel entitled to the
, that prote&ion of neutrality ? That certainly was
ate of the question ; in difcufling which it would
jferva- not be fufficient to (hew that (lie was built
jfficer, with American timber. It ought to be
knows (hewn that (he was a veflel entitled to all the
benefits of neutrality, and that (he was
from capture by the laws of war. "It was
is post- not the delivery of any paper by the assured
rfpung to the underwriter, that constituted evidence
-ood of in such a cafe as this. It ought to be made
ear the mamfeft, that the (hip was not made a law-
Our ful prize, he admitted that the underwriter
eift to was liable 5 tor the assured in such a cafe as
centre this could not warrant that injustice (hould
not so not be done by a belligerent nation to the
e could (hips of neutral powers. But upoti the au
-1 the e- thority of a cafe decided by lord Mansfield, |
fell iu it was clear.that if the vessel was not entitled
to the benefits of neutrality, the underwriter
iin.'As could not be liable for any loss ocpafioned
enoufh by her capture, that indeed was the eftablifh
0f g|/_ ed principle of the law. He quoted also
13 the opinion delivered by lord Kenyon in a
recent cafe in which' his lord(hip had laid it
6 recon' don-n as a rule that a fliip might be condem-
Ned, bcc&ufe (he had no fufllcicnt docutncnt
Ori board to prove her neutrality.- The quef- '
tioii on this cafe was to be governed very
much by the treaty between the two nations, -
America and France, and that part which
related to this queflion was the 25th article. -
By this article, that evidence, should be
given of their that, there should
be a sea-letter and passport, and thename of
the commander of the ship, (hewing that
really and truly the ship was neutral. The
ship mull have been recalled within a year,
aad her certificate renewed if returned with
in a year. The paflport was also to be figu
ed by the ftrefident of the United States.
Now wc should fee whether the condemna
tion of this ship proceeded upon any colla
teral points, or whether (be was 3 regular
prize to the Fretich republic, according to
the laws of war and the rights of rations, - as
fubfilting between America and France.
Here he read the sentence of the adm ralty
court of I'Orient, by which it was Hated
that the vessel called the Commerce, Anto
nio Caiftze, commander, was a pretended
American vessel, that the papers
of the proper form; that the captain
hadnot thefea-letter required; that the captâ
confefled he had failed without the. sea-let- .
ter and the paflport ; and the judgrr.ept of
that court pronounced upon.the whole mat
ter, that the Commerce had no right to
(hew American colors, and therefore she was
corylemned as a lawful prize to the Fren~h
republic. Having done t\M, Mr.. Erfkine _
said, he apprehendej he had done enough
to (hew, that the undewriter must be released
from all the consequences of the capture of
: this veflel, and that the plaintiff had no
right to recover in this adtion.
r Mr. Bowman proved the translation pro
f duced was a correct tranflatios of the fen
i tence of the court of admiralty iit I'Orient.
Mr. Law, on behalf of the plaintiff, fug- .
i gefted, that there was rro evidence that this â 
s was the fenter.ci of the court at I'Orient. ,
e The witness had only said it waÂ» brought to
t him by a person who said he came from an- .
n thority ; there was- nothing to (hew that
It this was not an assumed authority. That
d the fcal of the court ouglit to have been
el proved, &c.
at i Lard Kenyon said, that as to proving
ts ! the ftal of the court, or of ar.y other cor
as i porate body, he was quite sure that no
le 1 such thing was ever done ; he never heard
,e- Sos such a thing being done in hisiife. A
an seal of any court, or of any corporation,
n; always proved As to the other ob
he jeÂ£tian, that there was no proof that the
ed person who brought the document to the'
its witness, while in prison, had any authority,
re- he thought he was bound to take that au
ras thority for granted. If he required better
proof of that faÂ£l, he might require an im
m- pofTibility. And as to the decision of the
â¢ch court of admir Ity in France, he was bound
â¢ch also to take it for granted that it was cor
;n- reft. Courts of admiralty regarded .each
lad other's decifious every where ; they per
ok vaded every part of the civilized world, at
ed. least he hoped 10, for they were founded
to upon one geijeral principle of jufhee. Thefc
i/as points should be saved, so that Mr. Law
ige might bring the matter before the court, if
fed he choose it, but his lprdfhip thought
to himfelf bound to take all theft- proceedings
lim as regular, and therefore he ordered them
c?n to be read.
for The policy of insurance was also read,
â ere Lord Kenyon said, he was of opinio*
rem the plaintiff in this aftion. The
he policy itleif amounted to a warrant, that
hat the vessel was an American vessel, and that
ame it was within the proteftion of France.
of- }Ar. Law said, that upon the fase. of
oer, this sentence, they had Rated the law of
[per America entirely, and not. their own law.
(hip Lord Kenyon said, he really did not fee
)lic. that. They ajfpred law to the faft. This
who was a sentence of the court of admiralty,
lied deciding on the rights of all the parties,
urfe There certainly was 110 ambiguity here,
ras a There were dated certain requisites to enti
war; tie this ship to the proteftion of an Ameri
oge- can veflel. They were enumerated. ,It
1 the was dated that these requisites were not
, to complied with'; that the captain had no
lace, passport anil fen-letter, eyd th3t he had no
was, right to (hew American colours, and there
â¢adc, fore concluded that the ship was a lawful
the prize. It was efTential to us to pay :*ten
voy. tion to the decisions of their eouits of ad
fhip miralty, for they always paid attention to
irally ours; and we had much moreof.tbefe cases
bear, than they had. It was efTential to all the
were commercial nations of the earth to pr*y at
rwri- tention to the decisions of each other's
retrii- courts of
jw in of any complaints against them, except one
, and from the king of Pruflia, who said, "he
itain, did not undcrlland that your lawyers should
;tian, decide any cafe ; , that four cannon were
0 the much better." His lordship said he was
as to early of opinion that the plaintiff ought
is ac- not to recover in thisa&ion. If Mr. Law
eftion thought that opinion was wrong, he might
el was bring the qneftion before the court upon a
to the motion for a new trial ; his lordfliip added,
|y was that he wiflied the. motion ta be made, for
would he always wished that his opinion should be

MELANCHOLY ACCIDENTS.
Lift Tuesday night, on board of a vefTel j 1
coming down the Hudson, one M'Donald
and one â' â  ~ fell into a dispute, in which

went over together, the vefTel going five
knots. The boat was instantly got out, and
the men taken upâM'Donald was re ani
mated, but the other died. On this dead
body, we underfland, a jury of inquest fat
on Wednesday, and adjudged, that he died

The divisions in Montgomery county,
h<ive unfortunately aided the fhameful in
trigues of the Jacobin fa&ion in introducing
two democratic candidates in the (late le
gislature. But it was not, as ignorantly
and impudently alTerted in the Aurora, a
contest between order and disorganization.
The decided federalifm of Montgomery
county could not be more clearly evinced
than by the infamous and underhanded in
trigues carried on there by "the faftion :âÂ».
Too weak to (hew themselves openly, they
fought to perpetrate their designs by raoft
pitiful, dirty and dark manoeuvres. The
eleftion has resulted in the choice of two of
their creatures ; and this is owing rather to
the divisions amongst the federalifts, than to
any efforts of the faftion.
Mr. Bellew, abiurdly counted upon as a
jacobin, we are confidently assured, is a firm
federalift.
The eleftion of Mr. M'Clellan into the
Senate, is dated in the Aurora of this morn
ing, to be e triumph of Jacobinism. We
art happy to assure the public, that this idea
is totally falfe and groundless ; âMr M'-
0|ellÂ»n is not only a man " whose weight
will be thrown into the republican scale,"
but also a decided Federalill.

-4 ed French. They immediately carried capt.
d Kenuard, with two of his people, on board
d the schooner, there the capt of the pirates,
2 ! (for he can call them no better) ordered two
ft negroes to (trip capt. K. which they did
ie even to his (hirt, while the reft flood with
y naksd swords at his bread if he offered to
,e make the lead resistance. They robbed
j- him of his pocket-book, containing bills

several other gapers of considerable value,
took"; ills watch fidm Liu pocket, but that
returned with great relti&ance, abus
ing him to til* lad degree, telling birfl thcVf
they would set fire to his brig if he did not
tell where his money vrw. While that was
doing, about 8 or 10 of the pirates fell to
ruuiaging the brig ; they plundered every
neeeffary article they could put their hands
on, took from the cabin 3 or 4 dozen of |
wine and poster, 1 cafe fpii its, about 1 zlb. .

the captain's quadrant', which he set great
flore by, the mitf'-t daily afiiftant, and sun
dry other articles, striking the mate on the

guilty of
By this time it growing dark they order
ed the remaining crew on board the brig
to assist them in hoiftinjr out the long-boat,
threatening them with rndqnt death if they
offered to refufe. They unbent the brig's
main top-mad stay-sail, and pui it in the
boat, together with all their plunder ; at 8 .
