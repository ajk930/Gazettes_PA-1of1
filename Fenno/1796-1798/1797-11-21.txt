PARIS, September 9.
Proclamation of thi Executive DinSory to the
French people.
Citizensâ-the Frrtich people have in the
firft inftanee, committed the deposit of
their constitution to the fidelity of the Le
gislatiVe body, and of the executive power.
The fafety and integrity of this sacred de
posit hare been threatened by a conspiracy
of royalists, slowly and maturely organised,
carried on with craft and dexterity, and
followed up and pursued with perfeverauce.
The Directory have unveiled the plot ; the
conspirators have been seized, and the le
gifiative body have instantly adopted the
measures which the urgent nature of cir
cumstances h s required. No blood has
been (lied, wisdom presided over the opera
tion of the armid force, and coyrage and
discipline directed its exertions. The na
tional juflice has been avowed and conse
crated by the peaceable deportmeÃt of the
people ; it was made evident to the public,
, thrt there was no design of deranging the
present polture of things, but on the con
trary, of putting every thing in its proper
place. The legislative body, the executive
dirfftwyÂ»âttjtfaL.taiAfully MfJlctJ their du
ty. But the. French people have also de
posited their Mtgua Chatta in the hands of
the administrators and judges : They have
confided it to the vigilance, the enlighten
ed vigilance of fathers of families, of moth
ers and of wives, and to the virttrous affec
tions of youthful citizens ; in a word, to
the charadteriftic intrepidity which diftin
guifhesFrenchmen. Administrators, jndges,
fathers of families, wives, mothers, and
youthful citizens., Frenchmen of every age,
of every profeffiotÂ»> have you |Omp!ied with
your oaths :
Have you protected the deposit entrust
ed to your hands ? Look around you,
Frenchmen ! be watchful and observe ( it is
not too late) the snares into which the
friends of Icings and the enemiec of France
were eager to involve pou. In order to
curb' you anew undfr the yoke you have
broken, in order gradually, as though it
were by your own impulse, to fubjedt you
to it again, they have introduced into all
the public offices, corrupted men, but men
as crafty as they arÂ» perverse ; dextrous in
converting into m ingine hostile to the lib
erty of the people, the very power they
had been armed with, in order to defend
and confirm it. They possessed in your tri
bunals, prevaricating judges, who abused
the very independence which the constitu
tion had bestowed on them, and who exer
cised their rights, only to screen and protedt
the enemies of their country. Above all
it wait tHeir prime object and most anxious
care to recall France to the adoption of
monarchical forms, ahd to make the consti
tution, the fetes, the manners, and the
usages of the people, ponder and truckle to
the views of despotism. They were, well
aware, that man was a creature of habit,
and that by changing his habits, you chan
ged his very e(Fence. Monarchical forms
coincided no doubt, and marveloufly coin
cided with ahe views and wishes of the con
spirators, it was expedient and essential for
them, to cast anew in a royal mould,, the
mass of the nation ; but the nation repiilfed
the attempt with indignation and with hor
ror. The republic has triumphed, aud the
triumph of republican fdrma ought to be
blazoned and confolideted : such (hould be
the infigilia as well as the fruit of their vic
tory. A rtjiutMfcaif spirit, a republican
morality, and institutions,
ought to be cheriflied and prevail ; but in
order to comprehend and concentre them,
they mirft be better understood, and for
this we must begin by forming a more per
fect idea of them. The republican spirit
colledts and embodies all our interests in the
sacred focus of the public good, and takes
into its composition every thing that is just,
equitable, good, and amiable among man
kind. Among a people informed and in
spired by the divir.e spirit, justice presides
over their .social relations ; no one attempts
to injure the intereftsof another ; the equal
ity that prevails calls for and
Centres reciprocal affiftancfc ; fluiujd difftr
tnces arise, the right of deciding on them :
is not a lucrative trade,, that begets a dtfire.
to protraft a deeifion. Republican justice
is the sister of peace. Th'e mflft lovely, the
purest fentiinetit of natureâ refpedt for
hoary age ; conjugal endearment; paternal
fetidernefs, and filial pity. Sentiments
honoured in public are known to exert
their foft influence within the bosom of
private families, and derive from the ties of
blood, bonds of fraternity, of mutual af
fedtion, and happinessâThe arts offer up
in homage to the public weal the treasure
of their agremens, and the pomp of their
matter-piecesâeloquence, poetry, music,
all unite and conspire to kindle in every
heart the love of the country, and to rean
imate ,the engines pi valour. Courage and
genius are the offspring of liberty : The
pencil, the chisel, and the artful hand, of
the architetl, erect monuments in her hon
our. The theatre refeunds with the oracles
of morality, the sacred maxims of philoso
phers, and the incentive of pub
lic And private virtue, But the triumph
the fine arts is more eminently confpicmaus
in the national fetes, in these fraternal and
â¢ popular solemnities, in these awful and af
fedting assemblies, where one sentiment as
similates and moves the minds and hearts of
an immense people : dread and imposing
ceremonies, which cannot "be known in the
palaces of kings, which chill with horror
the partizans of despotism, but which warm
with an invincible charm the breaft.of repub
licans. In a republic, every writer, every
man of genius and letters is proud of the
name of liberty, profeffes its maxims, op
poses to error, to fanaticifm,., and to falf
heoa, the lights of inftru&ion and of know
ledge ; lends to the empire of the laws th?
support of his talents, and invigorates their
force by the supplement of his mental ex
ertions. He explores the true principles
of morality and of liberty ; he diffufes the
love of them, and propagates their influence;
he teaches his fellow citizens a more cor
dial love for each other, and above all
the predominant love of their country. It
is in a republican foil that public inllruftion
must flourifh ; this is the vivifying source
which,-like a pure milk, circulates, and is
distributed through all the ramifications of
society : Parents are eager to fend their
children to drink of and to be nourjfhed with
it. Private iilftru&ion constantly accords
with the public inftruÂ£tion ; the OBe pre
pares and leads or to the other. ' Over
both, the eye of the magistracy is vigilant,
and the magistrates, on their fide, whether
by the public exposition of the acts of gov
ernment, or by their zeal in diffufing the
light of knowledge, or by their aftivity in
promoting the celebration of republican
games, and of national fetes, and ahove all
by holding out the living example of their
own conduft and moralsâthe(e ir.agiftrates
are also the in(truÂ£tors and framers of the
public mind. It is here, in a word, where
there exists the most powerful spring, and
the grand moving principle of laudable ac
tions, and of courageous traits, that sacred
emulation which prompts the citizens to, vie
with each other in private virtue and publiÂ«
utility. The universal right to the chief of
fices of the state is the. firft clatife in the
compadt of equality. There is no diftinft
ion. There is no diftinjlion of birth or
privilege. Merit alone Is honored : Impe
rious motive to elevate men to sublime sen
timent and exalted enterprize ! People of
France, fitch ought you to be i Such you
would have already been, if your minds had
been thoroughly impressed with the princi
ples of your constitutionâis you had not
liflened to those who have vilified the repub
lican principle in order to re-eftablifli the
ycjie of ptiefts and kings. Ab ! cease to
give credit to them ! Hasten to quit the
path which they had marked out, and
which can only lead you to disgrace and ru
in. You ought to be the model and the
arbitev of nations. They wished on the
contraty to reader you the contempt of
mankind. See how they have deceived
you ! See whether the republic is the feat
vf terrorism ! The republic has triumph
ed, and yet the blood of traitors has been
spared. No ;it ie not blood which cements
republics. For the despotism of a "ingle
man blood must be (hed, but to found equali
ty laws alone are required. It belongs to
the constitution to be the guide of morals
and the compass oflife. Tesch it then to
your children. Get by heart and pra&ice
yourselves the deelaration of rights and of
duties. Resume with eagemefs the repub
lican cjftoms which will distinguish you a
mong other nations, and will render yoa the
model of free dates. Renounce fcrvile abus
es. Employ your own calendar, that ac
curate and convenient division of time,
which by an admirable fnature in republican
destinies reminds you that the fun begins the
year on the day when the republic began its
career. As your days of reft, constantly
prefer those which the law points out.â>
Let those days not only bring back to you
sweet repose, the reward and theconfequejice
of labour, but let it produce innocent joy,
let it produce family associations, the peru
sal of the laws, games, and entertainments.
Let the rendezvous of commerce, the fairs,
.the markets, henceforth correspond with
the republican a:ra. All civil affairs ought
to be regulated only by civil Jaws. Eyery
ufurpntion on the province of law ought to
cease in a republic. Tnke the name of citi
zen with honett pride. This glorious title
has sacred rights. Our fathers, in a despot
ic government, long envied the appellation.
They regretted, they deplored that they
were not citizens. Let that name be ever
dear, to you. Never employ any other, un
less to express contempt. Let the mouth
of a free man never be sullied by those feu
dal qualities, tliofe (hameful honours by
which you were formerly degraded, and the
most unassuming of which ought to rouse
your indignation, since it reminds you of (la
very. Henceforth let the spirit of the na
tion form itfdf among, and rife to thÂ£ pin
nule of ycur sublime destinies. Be the firft
of free nations, and let the natr? r' French
citizen be she mod honourable ol H p appel
lations. Let taste and heatr.efs prevail in
your dress. Let an amiable simplicity eve,r
bfe cherifiied ; let the youth stun pomp and
alTefttaion; let them rendurit unneceflary to
tell them to lay aside tbofe rallying marks,
those ctifto'ms of revolt, which are the rtm
form of a hostile army ; let beauty,
and modest, Adorned with its modesty, pre
fer.i:i its ornaments those which have been
woven by French hands. Beware of intem
perance, for it is one of the vices of flavet.
Frugality is one of the virtues by which free
nations arc diftiuguifhed. Be humane and
sympathizing. It is among a free people
that humanity is to be found ; it is oaly by
despots that it is trodden under .foot v ; the
altar of pily is in the hiart of every freeman.
Call to mind the principles which your im
mortal Montcfquieu afciibes to three gov
ernments. To defpotifnj he afiigns the
foundation of terror.' Honor is the phan
tÂ«m which walks in the train of Kings
but the basis aud the eflence of republics
is virtue. People of France ! In this
word recognize what your constitution,
your government, your country now require
from you. Do not allow others to fay, and
do not fay yourselves, that you are not re
publicans, because virtue'is the basis of re
publics. Do not calumniate yourselves,
not caufc yourselves to be calumniated.
People of France ! Be virtuous, love jyour
constitution, your government, your â¢coun
try, and you will be republicans, and noth
ing will equal your glory and your happi
ness. You ought to be attached to your
government, as both the supreme 'authori
ties which you have inilituted are attach
ed to it. Let this great example impress
- yeuc minds. The royalist eonfpirators had
disunited these powers ; and in breaking
through this link, the key-stone of the fp
cial arch, they had almoit succeeded in the
Overthrowing the republic. Thanks to the
destiny by which yqu are proteded: the
eonfpirators are no more, neither in the
directory, nor in ihe two councils. The
councils and the dire&ory at last go hand in
hand, and the republic is saved.

The following article we extra& from the
Revelateur, formerly called the Batave :
" The administrators of the Department
of Soane and Loire, difinifled by the Gov
ernment, had the impudence to impiifon the
courier who brought them the dispatches
announcing their difmrffal ; and it is said
that he recovered his liberty only by the
energy of the republicans of Macon, who
flew to arms, and did, not quit thera till
their demands were complied with. The
administrators of the AUier, supported bj
all the cut-throsts they could colleift, also
commenced an infurreftion agaioft the go
vernment."
" On the appointment of Merlin ofDoi*
ai and Francois de Neufchateau to the di
rectory, we hear that Gohier and Garat,
both art named as candidates
to replace thefirft as Minifter'of justice, and
Gingucne to |be miniftrr of the interior.

r The Government of Genoa, on the 4th inft.
experieteed a serious (hock. The excJnfion of
thtf Priests and Nobility from the offices of
State, which the new Constitution ordains, and
the discharge of the old officers, occaConed a
formidable tumult. The aristocratic paHy,
which consisted cfthe chief citizens, had at firft
the advantage, and became masters of the city.
Bat their triumphs did not continue long. The
democrats united themselves, and were assisted
â by the French troops. A combat took place, in
nrhich upwards of 1000 men loft their lives.
The French Ambaflatlor, Faypoult, and the
Coifiean General,Caflabianca,it is said, were at
\he head of the democratic party. Since then,
Genoa is surrounded by French troops.
FROM A PARIS PAPSR.
The following accour.f of the proceedings of the
French Legislature respecting the proscription ; â¢
of certain 'JournaliJls, Jhews that they ha ve
been treated in a Nummary mode.
Permanent fitting of the 6th and 7th,
Bailleul prefaced the report by some ob
servations on the conduft and principles of
certainjournalifts, who, it is evident were
in the interests of the fallen royattft confpi- ,
racy, either from congeniality of sentiment, j
or having been in their pay.
The projeft of decree which he proposed
was as follows : r
Art. I. The proprietors, undertakers, r
aireftors, authors, editors, and assistants of f
the journals of which the names follow g
(therr were 54 on the lift) shall be trarif- j
ported whither the direftory shall direst. '
11. Their property shall be sequestrated, f
and restored only when the authentic ac- p
count shall be received of their arrival at the 0
place of their destination. 1 ;
111. The direftory are authorized to as- a
ford them some provisional succour till they c
reach the place of their destination.
Several members, " The question."
Salicetti moved, that the direftory should d
have the right of making domisilary visits t
to seize the persons defiguated in the decree.
After some trifling opposition this was ear
ned. a
Talot concluded his observations in favÂ«r h
of the motion, as follows : ti
" I have said it, I repeat it, we were b
placed between the gallows and the guillo- ti
tine. Had our enemies triumphed, they p
would not have observed towards us all the
forms which they themselves require ; we I
all should have perished by the rope or at
the block- Lcfs cruel, we want no blood ;
but at least let us aft in such a manner as that (
they shall not escape the punishment they L
have deserved." â¢
Gaudin moved that the lift of journals
should be read over and the names consider
ed one by one. Adopted.
The Journal du Soir wa< struck off the pi
lifts, Bailleul, the reporter, seconding the tl
motion. % m
The word nffijlants was struck out of the n:
firft article of the decree as being too vague m
and general. cl
The Republican Francois tjas struck off ta
the lift. Then the Mercure. a't
The Journal des Speftacles was referred ol
back to the committee for further examina- a
tion. at
Quirot wijhcd the lift confined to the moll in
, ' prominent jonrnaliftj of the conater-r;*o!u-
tion'ary faftion, and not to includ: all those
lis who m;ght weakly have sided with or copied
â¢r- from them occalionaliy.
he Gaudin and Boulay supported this idea,
and wished the whole lift referred back,
' that a felcftio*. might be made*. Negatived.
| L'Hiftorien, printed by Dupont de Ne
[ mours was next moved to be struck off the
â¢o; iÂ»ft %
n. contended, that though the jour
â nal had, at times contained some articles that
" proyed the editor a friend to the fallen par
'J ty, it had contained many articles, especial
' ly upon the clubs, the priests ,and the divi
sions among the different departments of the
government of an excellent tendincy. He
id paid some compliments to Dupont's cha
rafter, and pleaded his age. " Dupont,"
said he, " has contributed to dilfeminate in
formation by his excellent work of the ci
tizen's cphemerides ; he has therefore cou
rt tributed to bringing about the revolution."
)t â¢ Taltien stated the influence of this paper
h as very great ; but reprefentsd the editor as
a man whose talents had been employed in
endeavouring to bring about the ancient
j ''eghne, and who protested, against the late
l 3 events.
I, Chenier supported the views of Boulay.
He agreed, that ll~liflorien often contain
if ed articles which gave pain to republicans ;
but often also very exeelleot observations.
He concluded by faying : " Without doubt
s you should have some confidcration for his
t age, and for the friend of Turgot ; âone
() who in the conflitutional aflembly coiftlant
ly supported the eaufe of liberty." He'ho
ped that this paper would at least b? sent
back to the committee. Agreed.
1 La Tiibune Politique was moved to be
' ft ruck out. Negatived.
We mention these details to (hew, that
the proscription lift was not made without
difcuflion or confederation.
Finally the lift of proscribed journals re
" mained as follows :
| The Guardian of the constitution ; the
; General fournal of France ; that of the coll
t an,ts ! th- Invariable ; the Impartial, print
ed at Bruxelles ; the Impartial Brurellfe
the Grondeur ; the Universal Gazztte ;

Though a failure of crops, in a degree, 1
may have taken place in England, we have
reason to believe, from a paragraph in a Lon- I
don paper of (he 19th Sepf, that it is not so <
great as might be imagined from fereral late '
publications. The paragraph runs thus: t
"It is with Angular fatisifaftion we find, (
from almost all our corn counties, the mod J
pleasing accounts refpefting the gathering in Â£
of the corn harvest, notwithstanding the t
late wet and tempeftoous weather ; and that t
all hands, and every day, Sundays not ex

Last evening arrived the (hip Farmer,

the arrival at Parii of the American Com
missioners.
ExtraS of a letter from Hamburgh, dated
Sept, 19, 1797.
" The imperial minister received, yester
day, an official note, that arders had been
given to release General La Fayette, and
his companions. We have a right tÂ® expeft '
that they are on their way to this place."
Sqrae of thÂ» pap-A-i aftei_aÂ»~MÂ»Â«Â«;ng the 1
marriage of Col. Humphreys, have added 1
âand have set off for Madeira. It (hould i
be Madrid.
Wignell is about to open his theatre,
with a renovated corps, which is said to bÂ« <
superior to any hitherto seen in America. ]
The partisans of the French triumviri, iti t
tliis country, in juftifying the recent prof- i
tration of the constitution, and their viola
tion of every moral and social principle, have
out done even the tyrants tbemfelves. They 1
haveblafted the proscribed en masse, atfd de
nounced them as traitors, without a lhadow
of evidenge, except the fabrications refpeft- f
ing Pichegru, which it ia to be observed, as- i
feft no other individual amongst them. f
The loss sustained by the republic, in the
person of Carno;, cannot he too higWy esti
mated. He was the fetili of their whole
military fyltemâ-and introduced in particu
lar, that mode of dividing the armies, to
which the French owe their mod brilliant
fueeefles. The division of an army into a I
centre and two wings was so modi
fied by Carnot, that each division constitu
ted a diilinft and separate army, afting up
on emergency, entirely independent and fÂ»-
parately. Whoever will review the history
of the last campaign cannot fail to observe
the striking cen equences of this arrange
ment. 1
Carnot was the friend and patron of Bu- Â£
onaparte ; and that general declares, in a S
letter to the deposed direftor, noticing cer
tain injurious reports refpefting himfelf,
that he esteems it the highest pleasure and
pride of his life, to. have been honored with S
the confidence and friendfhip of Carnot. It
,w not improbable that bÂ« may one day re
venge the injuries of his benefaftor.
A jacobin writer, whofc performance ap
pears in a paper printed at Elizabeth-Town,
New-Jersey, makes the following remarks :
" Whilst some of our }?esevdo-Patri
ots are criminatingihe conduft of the ruling
powers in France, in banishing the traitors to
the government -without /rial, it would-be well
for them to take a retrufpeftive view of our Si
otvn conduS during the revolutionary war B
with England, and be layi/h i*, abus
ing others for what we have countenanced
oiirfelves (for it it a foul bird that dirties its
own nefl) and fee if imperious necessity did not
propel us to afts as atrocious as their'*, such ri
as hanging men without )rial, as the writer of
this aflerts was the cafe in some instances." ri
The writer of the above is called on to 2,
cite an jnftance of Revolutionary phrenzy as- ca
the adoption of the constitution. At what In
time did our executive, in defiance of our b<
constitution, call on the military to seize ,on IV
the molt influential charaftcrs in the senate* F
and heufe of representatives, and compel as
many of their brethren as were in cuitody, (e
at the point of thq bayonet to acquiesce in to
the" tran(portation of thtir fellow-citizens, B
n- without trial ? At what time were either b
tin- fret citations of the [bites colJjiSlively
or individually, anulled by a'inilitarv man
date ? At what time have the peofcle ol
u: America been so loft to their right's and
oj their honor, as to submit to such degrada
tion as results froni the late oi
the arbitrary and usurping triumvirate oi
Fiance ? As to the pretext that thsft
unfortunate men were royalists, it never will
'i- be believed ; for if they were, they would
a* have been tried as such, and surely 501,000
'd armed veterans who are at the call of the
0 triumvirate were fufÃcient to prevent their
" r cfcape during trial. Freemen will remem
ber that to juftify such atrocities is to encou
11 rage the repetition,
