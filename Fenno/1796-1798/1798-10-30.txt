Lord Caftlereagh moved that the bill be

On Friday, Aug. 31, the earl of Farn
ham rose, and having the Dublip Evening
Poll in his hand, observed upon a paragraph
If inserted in that paper as an extraft of a let
is ter, which degraded the military charafter
e- of the Frazer fencibles, in a late flcirmifh
with the French near Caftlebarâan accufa
i- tioa his lordship stated, as not only of gross
a- falfhood, but for which there was not the
'*> fmallefl foundation, as he had authority to
le allure their lordships, that 110 mey could be-
have with more bravery and spirit than this
as body of his majesty's army had done upon
that occasion. His lordship strongly repro
bated this newspaper mode of vilifying his
majesty's forces, and which merited severe
pÂ«ttifhment.
The Lord Chancellor confirmed the state
ment of his lordship.
The Attorney GenÂ«ral rose to move for
leave to bring in a bill for amsndiag an a&
r . passed in the 36th of bis present majesty, en
-- titled an aft for lhe better preventing infur
y reilion and disturbances of the public peace ;
having moved accordingly, leave was grant

Id the House of Caramons on Saturday,

Mr. Arthur Moore, after descanting
some time on the inadequacy as the provif
fions of the Bill for preventing the crime of
aflaiSnatioii, moved for leave to bring in a ;
Bill to amend it.âLeave given.

j turning from transportation, and the min
h utes of the evidences given by Francis
Dobbs, Esq. at Mr. Le Bas, tending to
prove the acknowledgment of 75 state prif
_ oners, of a paper with their signature an
nexed, whereby they bound themselves to
go in voluntary exile*
â  9 Mr. Le Bas was then examined, and
proved they feveraHy acknowledged the
C paper as theif arm:
j Mr. Ogle observed, that amongst tbofe
S signatures was one of DÂ«nniÂ« M'Carty, a
c man who, he said, flood charged with
j murder in Wexford: He should carefully
e watch the progress of the Bill, that a man
e charged with so foul a crime should uot cf
1, cape with impunity.
Mr. For made a very able opposition to
r the third enafting clause. He* contended
, that to recognize, by adapting, the
proceedings of those military tribunals, 1
which were contrary to the eftablifhcd law i
of the land.
The Attorney General, in a few words
disclaimed any istention of declaring that
the sentences of M ilitary Courts were legal, i
Â» He aflented to the principle of Mr. Fox, I
j and therefore moved, that tha committee 1
report progress, in order to new model this
objeftionable clause.
The Attorney General stated, that he \
wished to add the names of several notorious .
and daring traitors to the bill for obliging 1
rebels to furrendcr, on pain of confifcatiorc a
of property ; the m&ft prominest of those 1
was Mr. Harvey Morrice, a companion and '
intimate of the unfortunate Dr. Esmond, '
who was executed. The next person was i
William Burke of NÂ«m. The Attorney
General then recited the names of three per- a
sons more. He said he had evidence to prove 0
tÂ» the house the guilt of thole persons. He
thsncal'edonMr. HoljneÂ«,&another member, n
who briefly recited some afts of rebellion, "
which*, to their knowledge they had been *
guilty of.âThe Attorney General then
moved that their names be added to the bill,

" On Monday, (yeftcrday evening,) I 1
went into the pulpit, the chapel being fu'l,
so that many could not get in. While the* 81
congregation was Tinging the two, last lines
of the second hymn, an old woman cried out
" the roof is coming down." One of our
fr ends knowing there was no manner ef dan- Â£
ger, in a whisper desired her to hold her V
tongue, but it was too late. Almoil uni- ,
verfal cries and shrieks took place. The
people immediately tufhed out,âThe court i
which is but fmaUÂ» was inflantly crtuded. V
âNone I think were hurt in the chapel:
but in the court, just on the outside of the
floor, 6 women, and a boy of four years old, Â£
were thrown down, and alai! dhs 1
trod to death t It was in vain to cry out,
" Sit stillÂ» for there is no danger." Nobo
dy gave the least attention, I never was so
much diftrefled in my life, it being the most
awful event I ever witnefled."

Insurance Company qf North America. ,
For In furance against Fim, on Dwelling- J
Houses, Ware-Houses, and other Buildings (and
on Goods cntKs.Uied in such Buildings) distant from
Philadelphia, in the United States.
f Common Tnfurar.ce*, on hazards of the flrft
class, will be undertaken at a premium of about
hall per cent, per annum. For extra V&ardous '
rifqnes a larger prcrr.iam will be required, which .
will vaty according to fcidom ex- !
ceeding one per cent, per annum ; but In some in- ,
(lances, where the property insured in not only in
itlclf extra hazardous, but rendered dill more so
by the vicinity of extra hazardous buildings and
occupations, the premium demanded will be railed
according to drcumftar.ces.
Houles and Ware-Houses, the walls and parti
tions of wbich are wholly of flone or rick, well
conftruded, so as to ba guarded as well asmay be
against fires from within, and tree from extra ha
zardous buildings and occcupations in their neigh- (
borhood, will be deemed hazardous of the firft
class, a"d may be infnred to thciffflll value.
â Mfo Goods and Merchandize, not ot an extra -
hazardous kind, in calks, bales, or package*, de
politcj in such buildings, to an amount not ex- t
ceeding 4000 dollars ; but if more than this fnm
is required to be insured in one tenement, an
tional premium will be required, in proportion to '
circumstances.
II- Infnrances will also be made on buildings and 1
Roo-i extra hazardous, at premiums proportioned (
tothorifque. But it is not easy to arrange these 0
under )'TrÂ»iciilar heads n r clafle*, so as to describe f
each with the necessary accuracy. Each caf-'. must
therefcrr be decided upon accordingto the circum- ti
it ; and these drcumftanccs wili, a
in general, appear from the description accompa- '
uying tl ew.ulicatioD 3
Kuildir.Â® partly eondrudrd of brick or stone, '
are preferable to these wholly wooden. And in
both cases, the ltile of builiiir.g, how they are oc- i
CHpied, how they are fituatcd, the neighboring a
buildings, and how occupied, are considerations to a
be taken into view. And withrefyeS tagoods, -
their tendency, whether from their nature, or r
from the manner in which they are exposed, either -
to commence or to increase an accidental fire, ai d T
their liability in such date *0 receive damage by n
wet, or by sudden a-d hasty removal, or to be fto- '
Icn in tirtie of conl'ufion and htirry, are all cir- e
cumftances of weight 5 and the premiums must be
proportioned accordingly. n
111. The fo'llowirtg conditiont are to be under- v
flood by the parries . ''
id. The Insurance is not binding till the ftipu
lateil premium be paid ; but it (hail be deemed cf- A
fedua! from tbe time of such payment and accrp- '
ranee thereof, whether the policy be immediately c
signed or not.
id. Ir.fiirancss may be renewed at the cxpira- 0
tion of the term of the policy, without further ex- ''
penfeÂ« than the payment of thu premium of the re
newed term, the circumdances continuing the fame l '
as they were underftood-by the Insurers at the time
the former irfiirance wis made ; but the payment 0
of the premium is eflential to such renewal; and "
if the party insured fuffers any time to elapse after P
the expiration of the former insurance, before he

mill, saw mill, dwelling house, barn, and a port
, age or carrying place, with between thirty and
forty acres of land, under good improvement, and
as much more in the vicinity, as may be required
, for future improvement.
The grid mill is a handsome, new and well fin

tation or for home consumption : Itis acceffiUle hf
water from every part ot the Cayuga lake an<i Se
neca-river, as well Be frona the Seneca-lakeâand
fromits situation, commands a veryestcjifive and
encreafiog caftom : The dream on which it stands,
being the outlet (5f thi/ Seneca-lake, til; mill cau
never V>c in want of water ; and as it has been kept
working durivg th* fevered season of the lad win
ter, it is not liable to be impeded by frÂ»ft 1

lad year, nearly two hundred bÂ«ats with their i
contents ; this objcA is already productive of a
handsome income, which ir uft be increasing and

Among the many advantages of thijfituition,
mud be numbered the fertility of the fun ounding
countryâ-being the bid improved part of the coun

coarfeby land and water, the-Geneflce dateroad
pafiing through it, as well as all waier carriage to
