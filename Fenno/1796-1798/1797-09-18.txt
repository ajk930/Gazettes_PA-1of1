GENTLEMEN,
Agreeable to yoiir request we now lay be-
fore you the following brief relation offsets, ,
Hate of the City Hospital.
Since the commencement of this inftitu- t j
' tion, 169 patients have been admitted into j
it. Of this humber, 69 have died, 31 have
! been discharged cured, 8 have eloped, and
1 Si remain in the Hqfpital :of whom 14 are
> convalefcenta. Unfortunately the difeafÂ«s
- of many of these patients were so far advan-
ced previous to their admission, and the in
formation we r&ceived concerning them so Â£
- imperfeft, that it was impossible either to c
render them any effedfual medical relief, or t
to form an accurite opinion of the real na- (
ture of their complaints, at the firft attack. L
Several of these had received some medical
affiftan'ce before they came under our care, j
while o{hers were totally jnejlefted during
8 the whole course of their illuefs. Of tiiefe r
1 many died from 2 to 24 hours after their .
admission into the Hospital. In thfc present j
return 17 are of that description. (
J" A great number of the cases which came
under our observation are billious remittent j â¢
fevers. A few have aflumed the appearance i
of th'e Typhus ISero'idts attended veith fymp- J ,
toms which indicate a cdnfiderable degree of ( .
malignity. One was the natural Small .
Pox, another the Hooping Cough, and in
two the molt firiking fyftiptom was dyfei)-*
tcry. The malignity in many inftauces has
probably been much increased by the unheal
thinefs of the places where the sick hare re
sided, fueh as small crouded houses in nar
row, confined, and badly ventilated alleys,
as well as other circumstances frequcnt
â s ly attending those who dwell in such places.
These circumstances have been rendered still
more unfavorable by the general desertion of
the sick, which has been a confequenee of
- the present alarm.
Not having been yet called oh by the at
tending phyiicians in the city and suburbs,
to-vifit the sick now under their care, we
cannot give a decided opinion respecting the
,; s contagious or pestilential nature of the difeaf
i!s !es in those parts. We can only fay, at pre
-1 s sent, that though the Hospital has been al
!" readyMrened 4 weeks, no ioftanc6 has oc
ltf curredot its being communicated to tl>c nu
c(j merous attendants whose duty obliges them
r.t to be among the sick both day and night,
n- in all Situations and jn all stages of tbe Fe
r j ter. Nor have any ot the grave-diggers, or
' 3 those employed in removing or burying the
he dead, been in the least affefted. We are,
a- extr*mely happy that we have it in our pow
ud ertocommunicatethispleafinginformation, as
it may in some measure, contribute to lefTon
the dread of receiving the coÃtagion of the
t.' disease by attending the sick, and prevent
that general desertion which we have nft
doubt has eonfiderably encreafed the mor
id tality.
We are,
Gentlemen,
, Your most obedient servants,

/The following observations were written
IV . a gentleman at the westward, on the oc
-'jf cafion of the Yellow Fever in 1793, andde
'/e signed for publication in the Pittsburgh Ga
zette. As they have never appeared in
_ print, iÂ» may not be improper to give them
a place in the Gazette at this time ; several
hints are thrown out of which an ufeful im
provement may be made%
; cc A"Subsc(iiber.
Tothe Printer of the PittsbOghGazette.
" It appears that from the 1 ft of August,
be- when the contagion firft appeared, to the
iv- x ith Oftober inelufiye, there have died in
7a- Philadelphia ef all ages, sexes and disorders,
lhe 1,247!. Of these 217 died in August, 12 21
|' lc " m Septembef, and 809 iii Oftober to the
â Hth. The mortality seems to have been
the progressive, though not regularly/ being
much greater on sultry, than on cool days.
On. the lit of August there died 8 ; on the
s}h 1; on the Bth 10 ;on the 30th
which is the highest number in that month,
and on the 31ft, 15 ; in September there
~ died from so to 87 daily; 011 the 4th of
.1 October, 'there died 56 ;on the 9th, 94 ;
on the 10th, 72 ; on the l Ith, 101 ; which
is the highest number that died in any one
day before thflt. It is probable that in this
der ftatemeiat the deaths of the ci:y alone are in
cluded ; forin another statement in the fame
pamphlet, the burials in the C ity and Li-
Ijij bcrtieip thofameptn'odamount L 02737.
The real condition of the city on the 16th
Oftcber is ilnted to 'oe this, that since this
mortality raged, 300 c perfone have died, a

lince the commencement of tae disorder ; ert
for above two mouths they had hardly 1 had tin
any rain, and .not above ttrt ur twelve mo- bet
derately cool days ; but a fall of rain accom- am
panied with cold weather on the night of pel
the 1 ;th Oftobcr, gave flattering profpefts i'ev
and introduced t fie favorable-change. I co
On the firit appearance of,the disorder, tin
its dangerous nature wasnot fufpeÂ£led. The me
deaths were received with the ufuai eo
ence. Had that fÂ«r, which afterwards be- Ti
came so enceffive, been timely awakened ; 10
and a Hufpit-il, which afterwards was ufta- mi
blifhed at Bu.li-Hill, for the reception of ot
the lnTefted, been provided iu the tirll ilage j m
of the disease, and dtjeifive measures adopt- I ex
ed to prevent indifcriminale communication at
between the sick and the healthy, and Hop
the fprtadifig of the malady, its fatal pro- fn
grtfs might probably have been soon termi- ti
nated, and the calamity assuaged. tl
Though terrible, it has not been generally m
fatal. Vast numbers of the sick jfrom four t<
to fcver.ty years old, have recovered perfeft h
health, one, two Qr three persons in a fami- h
' lv have been infected, a#id the remainder, al- h
though tliey have unremittingly attended
the sick, and put them in the coffin, have u
1 escaped the contagion, all the, attendants in a
, the Hospital at Bftih Hillaresn good health; si
many persons infefted it Philadtlphia, have f<
died ih different parts of the neighbouring ii
s states, and'yet, notwithstanding, they were n
well attended in their sickness. There is si
no authenticated inftanae of their communi- fl
' eating it to any who have died, or been very t
0 dangerously infefted. Yetfogreat has been f
1 the apprehension of this dreadful fcÂ«urge, i
that social conneftions have been torn afun- 1
' der, the feelings of humanity foppreffed, and r
precautions praftifed, which even the strong s
' Ipw of felf-prefervation hardly juftified. ;
p The defcrtion gf the Philadelphia market j
threatened to add famine to pestilence, the (
ir alarm spread over the continent; Public 1
11 fafts were proclaimed. Proclamations of 1
quarantine were ilTued by the Governors of 1
IC Maffachufctts. New-York, Maryland and 1
Virginia; Persons and goods coming from 1
" e ! Philadelphia, were excluded from many of
I the neighbouring towns ; and the mife
i rable people, driven by a pestilence at home,
. were refufed reception abroad. Some paf
ln fengers in the New-York Stage, becoming
sick on the road, were turned out, and a-
j bandoned by all, and denied shelter, or nou
rilhment, periihed of hunger and fickntfs.
e " Instances of the like nature Occurred on
r ' the Laricafter road. Even in Philadelphia,
s Â» there have been many cases, and some of
persons in great affluence, where the infeft
â¢n ed person has been deserted by his friends,
and resigned to the cart of a single negro.
Â°* Some have been so entirely destitute as to
want any humane beingto hand them adrink
of water, and have died in an empty house
without any to perform to them the last offi
)8 ' ces of mortality, and remove their bodies to
ve a grave. Parents have deserted their chil
'l>: drcu, children their parents, husbands their
1 wives, and wives their husbands. Perhaps
re " a fourth of the dead have been facrificed to
a '~ the consternation of the living. When the
,c " early terrors were dilpelled, these defertiwns
IU " became rare.

j a _ a father watching over his children, eon-

re we may contribute to raise their funk heads, per

1; fe&s of that calamity, under whith the un- hie
ie fortunate city must long fuffer. Consider, I a
g in thft disaster how maÃy poor mechauicks onl
re must have been deprived of their daily sub- ant
is fiftance, and how many young merchants and Le
i- shopkeepers must have been cast back in of
rf the world. We have it in our power to do P Q;
:n fomethirig for them. As soon a* a coneft- the

ig ahy other place which may be Lad there ; to
and let us encourage our Ihopkeepers to this ver
et generous and charitable duty, by dealing bu
he only with thoftf, who do so. This is the
lie heft kind of charity ; the receiver gains
of without any to the giver. While a /

j In the Agreeable romance of Gil B!dt,
J we have an excellent summary of the rncte-
J ria tnedica of certain bloody disciples of Ga
. len, so rampant in the revival of the lunatic
s system at a more modern period. The sol
. lowing is the account given by Gil Bias of
i the fuccefsful praftiee of his matter Sangra- t
â  3 do, in hiis own words A" He had the fatil
n faftioa of feeing twenty persons perish dai
;l ly under His treatment, and was so perfuad
[t ed of the excellence of venefuftion and fre
e quent potions of warm water, calling them
his 'tivo Jpectfics for every species of disease,
a that instead of attributing the lose of his
ie patients to his remedies, he believed that
:n the sick never died but for want of having
i e drank enough, and of having loft a fuffici
-5f cut quantity of blood." Gil Bias,
r _ had been his pupil and long praftifed upon
3r his system, observed to his companion with
3. a dolorous tone, as they approached Valla-"
le dolid, that " his conference frcretly re*
proached him at the memefft ; and that it
Jt seemed to hinv as if all the sick whtrm he
in had killed, were about to rife from their
at tombs to tear hisi in pieces." The reply
ur wa# at once natural and apt. " What an 1
n . idea ! really Siguier de Santillane, yciu arÂ£
10 to Â° gwd. Why do you repent of having
m performed your talk ? Look at the oldeit
n- physicians : have they any such remorse ?
yn Oh no ! they always jog on in their course

eveuts, and arrogating tredit from every

that propositionâthe eleftor palatine is of
r opinion that a letter of representation from

SALEM, September 12.
'e, Extratl of a letter from a gentleman in London
T, dated June 30, I 79>, to his friend in this
e- . town. 1
a- " Some time since yfti exprefled a desire
â i- to know what would be the decision of the
\t- boa'rd of commiffidners in cases where the
claimant had received, under the feutence of
trie lords coiTimiffioriors of ap->Â£a's, the a
mo.vuit ps or valuation made by the'
capt<i-s, hut (till claimed a further con l peu
fation from tire government. I could 'not
then answer decifivel'y, beeaufe the board
had not determined on any cafe thuscircum
ftanped: mice, it has; and I entlofe you
the report, by. which you will fee what was
the dccifion and- the effeft of ft, in the cafe
of the Bacchus. I enclose you a copy
from the "minutes of cases determined, and
the payable tb morrow by die
BritiflV government."
N. B. The Bacchus was captured and
condemned in the Weft Indies, with sugar
and coffee, bonnd to" Baltimore; and the
commiiTioners have allo wed upwards of 40001
IteVling, with intereCt, to the owners, over

WALPOLE, (N. H.) September 4.
3 , INCIDENTS ABROAD.
Reports of geueral peace begin to affuma
official importance. The emperor of Ger
many has communicated to the Diet of Ra
tifbon the conclusion of the pacific prelimi
naries between his empire and France, and
gives afTurance of a speedy and general
peace. Lord Malmefbury has been intro
duced to the. French legation at Lisle. The
present politicians contrast this interview
with that between this ambaflador and the
punftilioui De Laeroix, and augur imme
diate and general peace. What will be the
confequencea of peace to the powers oÂ£
Europe and the United States, ia an im
portant query. Let us coajefture a little.
France will soon be a prey to intestine fac
tion and war. Why ? Because her present
government derives its surest support from
/ her military force, which has not Â®r,ly con
quered its foreign, but awed its domefti*
enemies; but when thofc are disbanded,
and that hobby of philosophy, with its cap
and bells of liberty, called a constitution,
is left to operate without extraneous aid,
ambitious men will endeavour to overturn
r ft; bad men will cabal; mad men will af
r[ falfinate; philosophers will blow nÂ«w con
ftttutional air bubbles, and weak men wilt
a catch at them as they fuceeflively burst;
L while the mechanic, the merchant, and the
husbandman, the houeft and unambitious,
may again find in the regal diadem the
crown of their glory', security and happiness.
England may perhaps change ?ts minister.
Insanity may occasion a regency ; or death
advance a new king. Her OUTS may be
INS, and her ins may become outs. Her
| L e patriots may yell for liberty ; and "her jacoÂ«
3 bins, cry reform. Even her funds may fail 5
>n but wfiilft London is themart, Enland will
:: be the mistress of nations. No nation can
!1 rival her in the foreign market ; and peace
jj will open the ports of the world to her mer
chants. In war, the United States have
ii- fuffered from the jealousy of those rival na
-e tions. That of the latter has produced un
kindnefs ; that of the former, itifult and
cruel injury. In peace the scene will
IIT change, and Britain, add France, if fhc af
e- fumc-S any pretensions to commerce will
<1 court our cullom with fervour.

CAUTION.
WHEREAS a combination of men in t}Â»
county haTe undertaken to enrich thÂ«m
felves,by fabricating titles to fundr/ valuable trade
of land, the property of gentlemen living in New
York, Philadelphia, London and Paris, fqr which
traits of lend large funis of money have been paid
to those fraudulent men, by innocervt purthafers â¢
It is therefore just that public information should
be given, to the end, that the injured may seek re
dress while the men have -property, and are to be
found. Those who have been discovered are Tru
man Hdrrifon, Joseph Witcomb, said now to re
side in the county of Saratoga ; Thomas Kelly and
several other! who go under fiflitious names. It is
supposed that the lauds offered for faleon those fa
bricated titles, are at lead worth fifty thousand
dollars. Such as we have adual knowledge of are
as follows : Lots No. II and It, Btfego patent,
thousand acres each, the a&ual property of William
Dellwyn, now of London ; lots No. 58 and 64,
fame pÃtent, thousand acres each, the property of
Mr. Chauriiont, now of Paris, and |ames Averill
and others, ot this State. There is some grounds
to suppose that the lands of Richard Wells and
Charles Wharton, of Philadelphia, are under their
management.The Printers will do well to give
thiÂ»a place in their papers, as well to caution the
public against purchasing those lands, a 6 also to de
prive thoie men in future from imposing on indivi
dual, which their education and address have en
abled them to do heretofore Witcomb has been
a fhopkecper of some note in this country.
The following affidavits will fct in a clear point
9f view tin. wickedncfs of those men, which when
the public have perused, will induee them to ex
cuse the interference of Wm. COOPER.
Otfego, July i3th, 17 J7. ,
I Thomas Kelly, of the County of Offego, hav
ing been led into an error, by John Wiuoinb and
Truman Harrifon, of the fame County, to sign a
deed to them, for lot "o. 58, Otfogo patent, which
was the property of William T Franklin now Mr.
Chamont's and others ; and further the laid Joseph
and Truman did persuade me bo do this against my
inclination, which was made out on the 10th day
of November, 1793, or fef back two years so as
to bring it to that time; and further the name of
Pardon Starks to that deed was a fictitious name,
there being no faeh perlon there. To this I make
voluntary oath. THOMAS KELLY.
19th July, 1797- ' -
On the ipth july, 1797, came personally before
roe, Thomas Kelly, thf l'ubfcriber to the above af
fidavit, and made solemn oath that it contains noth
ing but the truth.

On the 18th July, >797, nau before me Jacob
Kibby, a person by me Weil known and worthy of
good credit, who on his solemn oath did fay, that
two of tht parties abovementioned did make ap
plication to him this deponent, some time in the
winter of 1796.t0 make them a deed for two thou
sand acres of land in the Otego patent, and pro
mised this deponent a (hare of the profits, on the
sale of said lands, for his so doing ; and that they
made'applicationfcveral times for tj}eÂ£ame pnrpole,
which services this deponent aÂ» often refufed, de
claring to them that he had no right to lands, and
coulddo no such thing ; which daring attempt on
thisdÂ»ponent's integrity he had related a-nong his
friendi several times, previous to making this affi
davit. (' JACOB KIBBEY.
