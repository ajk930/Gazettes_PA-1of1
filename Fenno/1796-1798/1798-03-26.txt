MISSISSIPPI TERRITORY.
FRIDAY âMARCH 2s.
The house being in a committee of the whole
on the bill tor the amicable settlement of li
mits with the state of Georgia, andfbrprovi- ,
ding a temporary Government-in the Missis
sippi Territory : I
" TV/I MILLEDGE renewed his amend
-IVL nient to insert at the beginning of the |
section di retting the temporary government
to be ereoted, " f<t soon as theconfent of the le
gislature of Georgia shall be obtained." âMr. M.
observed, that the felett committee had
now reported all the documents on which the
United States claimed aright to this territory.
AÂ» to the title of Georgia, he should not en
ter into any enquiry as to that. He would on
ly remark, that the State of Georgia wasaste
iiHciousof her rights as any State in the Union.
But he thbught it would not be improper to
e*unide the pretended claim of the United
States to this country. Looking into the Jour
nals of the Senate, he found that on the 3d of
, 795, a refohu ion was parted diretling
the Attorney General to enquire into and
make a report on the fubjeft of the title of the
United States 10 land in Georgia. No doubt
the Attorney "General not only examined the
recordsof the of Georgia, but those of
the United States, and obtained all the infor
marioH which he was able to do in the United
States; but not finding fufficient ground upon
v. h'ch to found a title, he applied to Mr..
Bayard, our Commiflioner in London, who
obtained a certificate on the fubjedl from a
Mr. Chalmers, .Secretary to the Board ot
1 rade and plantations. Twelve months after
he was directed to do so, the Attorney Gene
ral made a report on the subject ; "but none of
the documents which he reported went to
eflablifh the claim of the United States ; nor
any th'mg which tends to (hew that i ceilion
of Weft Florida was ever made. But he now
found amongst the papers got from the Sc
nate, a letter addrefled to Mr. Reed.of the Se
nate, from Mr. Liviogfton of New-York, in
forming him, that he inclofesan extract trqni
- the inftrrtftions given by the King of Gredt-
Bri'a'f, to Governor Chelter. But Mr. Li
vingltonVas not known as an official charac
ter"; ahd this document was neither official
nor'cert Tied. Y t this is the ground upon
w hich the United States claim this trait ot
country. Eefcre the General Government
proceeded to erect a temporary Government,
it ought to have better information with re
fpeCl to the nature of its claim ; for, to at
tempt to eftablilh .1 Government without the
content of Georgia, he thought would be
ftepp'ng beyond the constitution, two clanfes
of which he quoted. He hoped the general
1 ewers placed in CoÃgreis for the defence of
the country, would not be resorted to fanc
v,oi\ the proceed ins. It was laid, the inhabi
tants cf the d strict of country alluded to,
were in a filuaii-on which called for ittimedi
a-e :>t ention. lie allowed that it would be
â¢ rbrer to pay early attention to them; but he
â¢isougtn inconvenient as it might be, the
fretting Â°f a Government might be deterred
until the consent of the legislature of Geor
gia could be obtained. It ought to be remem
bered, tS:at :1k; state of Georgia is a member
of the Unio", and that it is her iirtereft to
make the ief ion, and he had no doubt (lie
would dft i'o. The convention of that state
meet in May, and if application was made to
them, he had nodoub' the Legislature would
be called together, and consent might be ob
tained by the month of July. He wasconfideat
the State of Georgia is de(irons ot promoting
the iuterefts of the United States ahd that (lie
is firmly attached to the Government ; all its
regulations had been conflantly carried into
eftett tht.re : and her consent to the eftablilh
ment of a p'rovilional government being ob
tained, every difficulty would be obviated.
â  Mr. Harper did not feel the fmalleftdeiire
to quefion the desire of the state of Georgia
to promote the biter-:(Is of the United States,
ahd he was glaJ to be infortned by herrepre
fentative, that (lie was so well disposed to the
general government, to which aflertion he gave
the fulleft credit. He, therefore, Ihould not
oppose the motion of the gentleman en the
ground that the state of Georgia would be
l kely tothrow a(iy obstacles in the way of the
proposed temporary government ; and he
ftiould be far from iuppefing that by the srec-
of such a government, the United States
would aflTume an extra-judicial rigtit to the
territory. He wascf opinion that the United
States polTelfed the right to it, qnd that the
molt undeniable evidence of the right exifled >,
but that evidence was not now before the
house, and if it were, they were not the pro
per body to decide the question. He believed
the amendment ought to be rejefcted 011 tHe
ground of policy. The bill went to provide
a temporary government, but contained an
claufe that the eftablilhment of this
government (hall not affect the rights of Geor
gia wiih refpeil to her right of the jurisdic
tion or foil of this territory. Conleqivently
the fears of the gentleman are groundless in
thfs refpeit. What, then, is the nature of the
amendment ? It is to prevent the erection of
a temporary government in a diftrift of coun
try containing upwards bf 5000 fonts, lying
far beyond the ordinary jurisdiCtion of any
state, with an immense wilderness intervening,
in which are two nations of Indians, and in
the neighbourhood of the territory of a for
eign nation, with whom, though we are at
present at peace ; when we recolleÂ£t the con
nection fubfilting betwixt that nation and
another with whom we have differences of a
Jerious nature, we cannot reckon upon as lad
ing. Yet this remote and vulnerable corner
of the unisn is to be left defencelefs, for an
indefiniteperiod of time,left welhould poflibly
give umbrage to the state of Georgia, by pro
viding n temporary government there, before
tlie-difpute on the fubjeit of limits is fettled.
And whatever may"be the good uifpofition of
Georgia towards the United States, it would
require considerable time to obtain the con
sent proposed. Their legislature do not meet
till next Winter. It was true, as had been
slated, that their Convention met iri May,
and they might, if they thought proper, call
an extraordinary meeting of the Legislature ;
but this could not be relied upon. Besides,
he saw no necefÃ;y for so much punctilio in
Â» this cafe ; for fany state were toluftera part
Â»cf their territory, within its ordinary jurifdic
% tion, to lie in a defencelefs tiate, the general
government would be warranied in stepping
o'ltto defend it.'andcertuinly they might do it
ji a caf; like the present, where Â»no jurifdic
tio" is exercifcd. And if this was not done,
the petition of thefc people set forth, that how
ever unwilling they ftiould be to do 10, they
fliould be obliged to pass over to the Spanith
dominions.
Mr. H. said, he did not wifti to have touch
ed upon the question ot right ; but as the
gentleman from Georgia had said we liad none,
he felt himfelf obliged to fay a.few words up
on that point. He allowed the-committee
ha<l not before them evidence of the fight
which would be admiHible in a court of law ;
but though it were not f'uch as would be ad- j
I routed in a court of law, had it theÂ»efore no ;
weight ? It was at teaft equal to what was eve-
ry day rece.yed by the committees of the j
huufe. The question was, whether the pa
pers before thetp afforded reason to believe
that legal evidence of the title didexifl ? It
was a copy of a conuniffion aud lodruCtions
given by the King of Great-Britain, to Go- I
vernor Chefler, of Well-Florida, in the year
' 1770, furnifhed by the gentleman who was
Secretary to the Governor at the time, and
I whole duty it was to keep the records of that
government. But the gentleman from Geor
gia said, search haJ been made in the offices ot
tlÂ»e British government for the original, ot
which this paper was a copy, and it could no;
be found. But this was no proof it did not
exilh If it does cxift, legal evidence may be
obfcriifed from it ; aud this paper (hews that
the Natchez country was included within the
territory ot Welt Florida, and that it ceafedirt
the year 1770, to be a part of Georgia. He
believed, however,, this question not
now to be afted.upon ; but that from netefli
ty, and the exigencies of-the cafe, a tempo
rary government ought immediately to be
provided for this dilTriitof country, an 1 af
terwards fettle the point of right wiih Geor
gia by negociation ; and if ifwas found in the
end that the United Stales had 110 title to it,
the government which had been effablifhed
could be withdrawn.
But it was Hated, that the legislature of
Georgia would readily consent that the United
Spates (hould become pofll'lfed of this coun
try. But what, he asked, were the terms up
on which they propose.l to cede it ? I hey re
quired, as one of the conditions, a "million and
a half of dollars in fix per cent, (lock, and as
another (which was infinitely harder, lince it
might not be in our power to comply with it,
as it depended Upon the will of the Indians)
that the United States will guarantee thÂ»re
linquifhment of the Indian claim' to the land
on the east (ide of the Catahouche, within a
certain number of years. There is little hope,
therefore, that the state ol Georgia will pro
pole any terms to which the United States
can agree, as it had been seen that the legisla
ture of Jhat (tale had rejected a bill by a great
majority, which proposed the price to be one
miilion'of dollars, with the other condition.
Of course, it would be very imprudent to reft
the eftablifhmcnt of a government in this
quarter, upon an agreement to terms like
these.
Befldes, the amendment would affect the
right claimed by the United States. To wait
for this consent would be tantamount to con
felTing we had no right, and arm Georgia
with a ft ran g weapon against us in the final
settlement. /
Mr. H. contended that there was nothing
in the comTitution which .could prevent the
proposed measure, lince it was absolutely ne
cefl'ary to prelerve the people from falling in
to anarchy, and to prevent a foreign govern
ment from putting arms into their hands. It
was also a quarter of the Union which it was
necelfary to preserve, if we wished to secure
the free navigation of the Mifliflippi, which
we had lately obtained by the Spanish treaty ;
for if this country were invaded by the Indi
ans, or involved in civil war, we could not
have the benefit of the navigation of that ri
ver. He hoped, therefore, when so many
confederations were opposed, to it, the amend
ment would be difagfeed to.
Mr. Nicholas understood from the gen
tleman from South-Carwlina, that it was not
intended to infill upon the title bf the United
States to the territory in question.; and it they
were net ripe to decide that the land istfhe
property of the United States, he thought
they ought not to eftablifli a government therfe
without paying fonie refpett to the rights of
Georgia, by obtaining her consent, as it
might prevent that amicable settlement of
whichwehadat present the profpett. Ifthat
Hate l'ct the Value upon the land which had
been mentioned, would it excite the ut
ntoft jealousy in that country to take forcible
pofTellion. of it > To do this, would certain
ly be to eftablifli an influence in favour of the
United States which would be fatal to the
claim of Georgia. No argument had been
adduced to Ihew the right of the United States
to this territory ; but merely to (hew the con
venience of the measure. TJie gentleman
from South-Carolina might as well fay," that
a certain diltritt in Virginia is not so well go
verned as it might be, and that as the people
wotild be happier under the government of
the United States, propose to take polTellion
of it. But it was said, Georgia had not be
gun to govern this territory. Neither have
the United States. She may, for ought we
know, be preparing to do it now. , He thought
there was not a (hadow of pretence for taking
(he course proposed, without firfl consulting
the legislature of Gesrgia ; he hoped, there
fore, the amendment would be agreed to.
Mr: J. Wiuliams. It appeared to him,
nhat if ihii amendment were to prevail, the
bill mighr as well be vdted out altogether.â
The bill had two objetts, viz. a settlement
of limits,, and the fixing of a temporary go
vernment. It was clear to him, from the
pipers before the committee that the United
States had a clear title to the country in ques
tion, and, if this w<is not the cafe, there was
a saving clause in favour of the Georgia claim.
He thought that (late ought to be happy at
the idea of the United States fixing a govern
ment there, as it would allifl them in their,
defence againfl the Indians. If gentlemen
turned to the aÂ£ts qf Congress, it would be
found what a vafl expence the United States
had heretofore been put to in defending the
frontier of that country. He thought that
(late had been dealt with in a very favoura
ble manner. It was not long lince 100,000
dollars were paid to their militia fordefending
their frontier. He complimented the gentle
man from Georgia for having advocated so
ably the cause of his (fate. But he thought
that state ought to come forward and (hew
what title (he had to this country. It had
been ceded to the United States by the Spa
nish treaty, and the inhabitants there had a
claim upon the general government for pro
tection, and surely if the state of Georgia for
ever refufed to give its consent to a govern
ment being established there, they Were not
forever to be without government. The
people there had petitioned Congress .for a
government, ol which doubtless the state of
Georgia was acquainted, ai>d they ought to
have come forward in the bulinefs. Their
silence proved to him'hat they had no title to
that country. Mr. W. referred to the man
ner in which other cefiions had been made to
the union, and fa.d, he thought Georgia
ought to rejoice at the proposed eltablilhment;
as it would not only be benefiting that State;
but the Union at large.
Mr. Macon. If the title was intended
to be conformable to the title, the amend
ment ought certainly to be agreed to ; as if
the United States Uiltierlcok to eftablilh a
government at the Natchez, without the con
l'cr.t of Georgia, it could not be said to be
amicably done. 1 This, lie said, was neither
the proper time nor place, of deciding to
whom this territory belongs. The great ob.
jedt buglrt he gef a government there,
and iicnt i talk about what had been done for
I Georga. And it the content of Georgia
: could be obtained previous to the eftablifliment
ef this government, it was cer'ainly desirable
i that it should be obtained. I his would not
; iiijurc-the claim of either. When this was
: done, tome-mode might be agreed upon by
which the difipute at present subsisting, might
be fettled. This course would prevent any
i difficulties, and the content might be obtain
ed by tlw time the government could take
efl'edf.
Mr. Otis. If the object of the present
bill could be obtained ii*a mode which would
prelerve rights of ail parties as they at
present stand, such a courfc would be prefer
able- to that which should appear to rehnquith
the ri>-lit of aneofthe parties. Itftruckhim
that this might be eft'efted by the btll as it now
Itands. The United States aiHimed their right
to the land, yet they do not fry they to
turn a deaf ear to the claim of Georgia but
if thi ameiidme-iit were adopted, ii would go
to fe'linquifli ths title ot the "Dmted States,
and rifis, he thought, woiitd be an excels ot
coniplaifaiice to the (late of Georgia. T ne-'
only plausible reason giuen in favour of the
amendment was, that it the bill palled with
out it, it would give offence to, and excite
j-aloufy in tjie (iate of Georgia. But how
Because Congress palTes an ait to fettle the
interfering claims, and directs the appoint
ment of cornmiffioners to give ti.em a comptn
fation for what we might tatce without it ?
O becaute we fay we will enter upon the ter
ritory to which we al .vayslaid claims, in oide,
to preserve-peace and order aniongft the inha
bitants, and to secure it against the attack ot
the Indians or of a fereign power ? Gentle
inen seem to take it for granted mat* Georgia
has poffetfion ot this territory ; whei'eis thole
who oppose the amendment contend it is a
vacant pofTeflion, and that we haVea right to
take rvofleijlon of it, to hold it, not until an
army is railed to take ii from us, but until the
legal queftiort of right fha.ll be decided. And
it could not be said that there was any thing
offenfivein thiji Ifamau, forinftance, were
to enter upon a piece of land, and- lay he
would never give it up until he was driven
from it, it would certainly be an ait of viq
; but if he enter upon it only to take
care of it, uitti) a legal decifior. can be had as,
to his tight, fitth an aif was perfcÂ£Hy julLfia
ble j a-iid t-hiS vyas all that was.intetwled inthe
present cafe.
Mr. Kittera hoped, if the bill palled at
all, it would be without the amendment.
This territory was never yet governed either
by the United States or Georgia, but had been
ceded to the United States by Spain, inour
late treaty with that power, and we ought to
retain poUeffion of it until the title to it was
clear. In this view ot the ftibjedt, he could
not lee how the state of Georgia could take
offence at our holding the territory until the
existing dispute was fettled.
Mr. Baldwin said, it was to be regretted,
as this was the last inllance in which thisquef
tion cfcellion could be presented to Congress,
that the fituatiop of the persons fettled upon
this territoy, was such as should seem to con
drain gentlemen to depart from the course of
their former proceedings on this fubjett. He
was fully inipieflfed with the Situation of that
people ; but he thought little delay would be
occasioned by the proposed application to the
Hate of Georgia ; nor would that consent
weaken, as had been suggested, the title of
the United States ;â  or if there was any forcÂ»iii
the objection it might be guarded against by
adding a jew words lathe fedtion which speaks
of preserving the claim of Georgia as it now
stands.
Mr, B. said, gentlemen tvho had turned
their attention to the map, would fiiiJ that the
territory inqueftionis situate at the fouthwelt
corner of the United State* ; the southern
boundary is latitude 31, and the western boun
dary, the MifTilTippi, which is also the boun
dary of the United. Its extent is abou.t
280 miles tiorth and /011 th, and coming this
way, about 400 rrftles. That part upon
which this bill is bottomed, is little more than
one-third part of the whole of that territory.
The United States now reckon latitude 32J as
the boundary of Georgia ; but in the treaty,
and till very lately, it was always reckoned to
be 31, which is also the boundary of the U
nited States. This was, at any rate, a new
discovery, the official documents infupport of
which he had not seen. It was now i'uppo
fed that Weft Florida extends to latitude 32!
and not to 31, which is one degree and a half
more than formerlyf&pwfed. If this were so,
he wondered it had before been disco,
vered by England or Spain. Why was the
boundary of the United States always fixed at
31 ' He feared, that Since it became our in
terpft to extend the boundary, we had fuffer
ed that interest to colour our judgment. The
inftrudtions drawn out for pur minilter by a
former Secretary of State were, " you are to
contend Sir latitude 31." The ground upon
which he (tated this, Mr. B. thought irrelilt
able, and it was thought we might risk a war
upon it. Belides, this bill would not cure
the evil for which it was intended. There
might-be inhabitants still farther north ; this
bill provides only for such as are fettled with
in what had been called the Province of Weft-
Florida. Mr. B. said, he had never seen the .
documents which authorized this extension.
Ke had, indeed, seen the remarks of Mr.
Chalmers, who, he believed, was Secretary
to the Board of Trade and Plantations in Lon
don ; but he believed he had drawn what he
had said from the fame document which was
now reported, viz. the extradt.Srom the copy
of the inftrudtions said to have been given to
Governor Chetter ; but the order of King
and Council for extending it, the Attorney-
General fays in the 11th page of his report, is
not to be found.
Gentlemen had .said, why does not the (late j
ot Georgia manifeft adifpotition to make Some
arrangements refpedting the territory inquef
tion. They had done so. After the revolu
tionary war in 1783 or 1784, when there was
an expectation that the forts would have been
evacuated, they laid out a there, and
all the titles were declared good, and where
there was no other title occupancy was decla
red to be futlicicnt, and warrants were to be
issued accordingly. When he firft came to at
tend his duty in Congress, the Min*er from
Spain arrived about the fame time, when he
put in the claim of Spain to this territory,
which preven ed any thing further from being
done ; and as soon as it was found that the
arrangements made by Georgia gave umbrage
to the Spanish Government, they were given
up.
1 In the yeas 1788, the state of Georgia passed
1 anadt for masing theceClon of this territory to
; the United States. This %it Congress referred
to a committee, which reported that Govern
ment ought not to accept of the ceflion 011 the
I terms proposed. He believed the fame difpu
fition to make the celfion which always had
i 1 exiiled, now existed. He believed thedifpo
-1 | fi'.ion of the -Government of Georgia was ass
; favourable to tjjeitucrefts of the United States
'' as that of any other State. He did not rife to
(peak their praifex; but he could not fit 10
1 hear them blamed, without notice.
If the proposed goyeromer.t was proceed-
Ed w"ifh, without the consent of Georgia, it Â«
would be a direlidion of principle. He
thought fomefort of regulation might be made
a-nongft the people for their own government,
until Georgia was applied to. This was not 3
new cafe. There had been great settlements F
in several parts of the country long before I
'any government was provided for them. Mr. j
B said, he did not mean to undervalue the f
claim o'f the United States ; they had always g
' a claim in every cafe of feflion, but he hoped,
except there was an absolute neceflitv for it,
the ufufil course of proceeding would not be v
deparurd from. 1
Mr. Gordon the gentleman from Geor
gia complained that a different course was propo
sed now to be taken than bad been adopted hereto
fore. Inanfwer to this, tt was 'fufficent to fay,
tb.v 'where the etrcumftanees if caps, differed, i
i different mrfes â¢werenrefffar?. if:lb refped to
the mtriit *f the bill, hi tbwgtt it /toad right at
prtfent. Thi fitvalion <if the p&pte in ibe diflrffi â¢
alluded to, ivqsfuch of required immediate atten
tion. If gentlemen were not convinced of this, â 
be fail) no necefftty fir going into the buftnefs be- }
fire the fttbfifling dfpute belling t Georgia and 1
the United States was fettled. He believed, t
j boiMCvei', there luas -no dnubt of the fail, and c
surely the gentleman from Georgia -would not n-ijtt c
that these people should in<e under a military go- t
<vernment for zr.y length of time. Beittgfatnfied
rf this point, be ivifhed the bill to pass ivitbout the a
amendment, us might defeat altogether the . '
purptfe of the-bill. The claim of Georgia, be looked 1
upon at leafl as and as he canjidered â¢ y
the IJnited'States as bound to proted all us c iti- ' j,
zens, he thorght the\- would not be jufltfiJt in re- '[ c
turning these people for anfiwer, " ii> r e cuttttot at- ,
tend to your wants until ive ba zrfettled our d fpute
with Georgia:' Georgia might refufe to nego- i J
date upon the fuSjcel, and by that means protract d
the bujinefsin a manner which would be 'very in- e
convenient, and perhaps dri<ve the people under, j,
another government. Bejides-, if Georgia should \
refufe its consent to the eflabltfbment of a govern
ment in that quarter, it would, be &
proper to eflabli/l one. The United States, Mr 1
G. said, came into poffejjtun of this territory by v
treaty. Butfvppofe it was now in pojfeffion of a (
foreign power, would Georgia attempt to drive
them from it ? Certainly not. It would amount
to the ina king of war on a foreign power. Suppose
Georgia bad a title to this territory,, bad nut the â 
United States thepower of depriving "C.~~fia of â¢
its 'Suppjfe, In their treaty with Spain, the Unr- !
tettberr)fur rendered to Spain one balf of this land, 1
or thf tubole of it, Georgia would have been I
bound \y such an ad ; and having got this terri- j
lory by treaty, tbej bad certainly a right to eflab- j
itjb aprovifional government over it, until the j
difptite, as to the title, was fettled.
The question of this amendment was put
and negatived 46 to 34-

NEW-YORK, March 21.
Ovr readers will rtcolietSt that when the pa
per* containing the proofs of the conl'pi ocy of
Pichc-fcru, Were firft published in the United
Statt, many people pronounced tliein fabrica
tions, and all, even the friends of the present
rulevs of France, had their doubts of their au
themicity; but some peoo'e affedled to believe it
impoflible for the Direflory to be so daringly
wicked, as to procure papers to be forged for
the purpose of ridding themselves of the compa
ny ofhoneft men, by a viphtion law and
coriftitution.
We never hid the least doubt on either of
these points. The papers carried forgery
on the very face of them; and we have itated
in former p'.prs, that flprtilar forgeries have been
frequently praitiftd, and'dctedt.'d, during the
revolution.
The declaration of M. D'Entraigues, and of

the conduit of the present government, of
France. and other vicious
Roman F.mperorj, carried their contempt of
virtye and decency, as far in particular instances,
towards individuals; especially in foo.e of their
drunken vagaries. But never, never was villainy

March 3. 1
" Oil Thtfrfday last, about midnight, the I
inhabitants of this town were alarmed by
the cry of Fife. A large body of smoke t
was discovered issuing from the cellar of the j
PalaGe, and so filled the entry and appart- 1
ments on the First floor, as to leave it as a 1
matter of doubt, what part of the building .
was on ftre. The flames firft made their apt
pearance through the floor next to the foot <
ef the flair cafe ; they almofl instantly reach 1
ed the cupola, and the whole roof blazed t
nearly at one time." 1
" Every piece of timber, and all the 1
wood work of that edifice, both within and <
without, were corffumed., The Colonnade 1
whichjoined the main building to the wings (
was pulled dowrf, aud tht fire did not {pread 1
any further. 1

MR. RUSSLLL,
I fend you an extra# from Edes and Gill
paper printed in Boston, the 26th Nov
1759 ; with a request that it may be rc l
published.- It will then be seen, that the
sentiments and language of the French ha? e
always been precisely the fame FreHthmen
â will be Frenchmen Jlill. âThe paper I l cai ,.
with you to be ftitwn to any one who douhtl
the faa. A . B
Invasion of England.
Exaft tranjlut 'ion of a letter from the Marshal
Due tie Bdleifle, to the Prince de Soubiie
uJjoii the Intended conquejt of England.
Though the king cannot doubt, but that
your highness will punftually execute all
that his majesty gave you in charge at part
ing, yet his majesty's attention to the in
terests of his people, and the glory of hit
crown, (two objects that are infeparafely
connected) is such, that he has ordered me
to repeat to your highness his commands,
and to add to them whatever suggests itfelf
to me for his ferviee.
His majesty, Sir, has committed to
you the fwerd that is to chastise a proud and
insolent people", from whom France has re
ceived more injuries, th-.ni from all the world
besides. I felicitate your highness upon
your being appointed to command an expe
dition, that can hardly fail of success : An
expedition worthy to be planned in his ma
jelly's councils, and worthy you to txecute.
I have, Sir, the mure confidence to con
gratulate you upon this glorious dillin&ion,
ft'ewji you by his majaly, betaufe I myfelf
was once an eye-witn*?ls of the difficulties,
(which are next to none-) which you have to
encounter, after your troops are Undtti, for
there I conceive the gi-eaicft difficulty mull
lie. Yes, Sir, my misfortune of being a
captive in England, has tuxned out tc, the
good of France; btcauie it has enuDi.d me
to execute the king'; commands, la wr 'in*
to your highness, Â«i u more prrcifion, as
well as to concert, with greater certainty,
the meafuves ot the expedition vou are en
gaged in.
" In the firlt plac, then, the kinjr's idea
is, that the nearer yorir traops can land to
the capital, the success of the expedition
will be the ijiore certain. But if, through
the accidents of winds and tides, which
none cats forefee, you should be obliged to
land at the distance of 'BO or jcÂ© milti
(which is the most that we can iuppofe)
from the capital, yet I have the pleai'ure to
a flu re your highness, that you will meet in
your march towards London, which is thÂ»
great objett of your destination, with r.one
of those obstacles of forlifided towns, en
trenched pasTes, or strong camps, that oc
cur so frequently in those countries that have
been long the feat of war, andof whichyour
highness and I have had so often the expe
rience.
"Ihaveftillagreaterpleafure in informing
your highness, that the English regular
troops, at present, are mostly ia\v, new
railed, and undifciplinej ; The bell part of
their army being employed in Germany and
America. Some of their old regiments are
in Scotland, and others are distributed thro'
England, to curb the spirit of difeontent
and difaffe&ion, that every where appears
against their government; and which must
operate greatly in favor of his majelty'i
arfris, as soon as they can be carried by your
highness to the Britilh (hore6.
" After faying thus much, I need not
inform your highness, that the refiAance
you will meet with, in your march to the
capital, will be but feeble ; nor, perhaps,
had it not been for his majesty's pefitive com
mand, needed I to remind your hightiefs of
the necessity of making cheice of the strong.
eft grounds for your cimps upon your march
and entrenching your troops every right for
â¢fear of a surprise. I am, however, in a
more especial manner, it to
your highness, to leave the enemy do re
sources, either of subsistence or habitation,
excepting such of them as shall give your
highness unqutjliondble proofs of their sincere
fubmiffiou and attachment to his majesty's
ferviee,
" The glory of France, Sir, requires,
that your highness (hould not, like the En
gliffi, aim at a diverfton, but a conquejl. and
what a glory will it be for a prince of the
house of Bourbon, to plant the standard of
Fiance upon the towers of London. His
majesty's ideas, Sir, are, that where con
quelt begins, all liberty, and all property,
those savage terms, (vice: terms farouchesJ
that are so often in the mouths of our ene
mies, must determine. In this, Sir, your
highness well knows, his majesty is warrant
edj not only by the law and practice ot
nations, but by the example of William
of Nsrmandy, a vaflal of France, who, hav
ing conquered England, forced them to part
with their freedom aud estates ; which, as
I hope your highness wilj have the glory 0
doing, under his majesty's *"thoii
ty, he distributed amongst his faithiol Id
le wers.
" His majesty, whofe-innate clemency is
favorable even to his enemies, does not com
mand your highness, unless there is an abio
lnte necessity, to put all to the sword, with
out dilh'n&fon of age or sex, who o no.
join vour standard. But I apprehend there
will 'be a necessity for leaving them no re
fo.irce, as I had the honor to mention be
fore to your highness. either of fÂ» 1 '
or habitation. A prince, who like you
.ighnefs, cultivates no sentiments bÂ»t what
are magnanimous and g" ,ero " ! '/r :p' rtc i
tain no noticui of the perfidy" '
ers, and their implacable
Sir, and the provocations they a g
France, will warrant the moll severe, and
what in other cases, might ece
most cruel treatment that can be M*
upon them. Your highness, who.inhmtt
tfe sentiments, a. well as
great Turenne, must have le /which,
proceeded against the Pal****,wV I compared to England, was iaoffcnftve
towards France J as soon an his mailer's glo
, ry required him. He did r.ot, Sir, indulge
the mistaken notions of humanity, which,
at such a time vrould have been criminal, but
proceeded indiscriminately with fire and
sword againll the enemies of France, be
cause none, who are fo'can be innocent.
And ytt, Sir, give me leave to remind you
that Yuremic had not a foe so inveterate and
unrtafonable as to deny, that in his praÂ£lice
' Â»3 well as disposition, he always manifefted
sentiments of the most fublittfe virtue and
tender companion.
Â« But such, Sir, is his clemen
cy, that in the facrifices he (hall offer to his
jtlftice and his glory, you make a diftin&i
cn betweeo a<Sls of refinance by deeds, and
thoft by 'word. The latter, in forae cases,
may be equally, nay more criminal ; but
when they proceed no further than com
plaints, or, in some cases, remonstrances,
his majesty, out of his unlimited clemeney,
wills that you spare .the lives of the offen
ders, and reserve them for his gallics, if they
are proper, and able bodied, for that ser
vice ; if not, his majeily leaves it to your
highnefii, what other punishment you will
inflift upon them. v our highness is len
fible, from the particular information I had
the honor to lay before you, of the necessity
his majeily is under, of fabvicatinng and
manning an additional number of gallies ,
and I need fay 113 more to convmcea prince
ft}, enlightened at your highnefi, of the ne
cessity of that service.
" As to the alterations which his majesty
shall think proper to introduce into the in
ternal policy, government, and religion of
England, his majesty has commanded me to
tell you, that your highness (ball receive
full inflrtnSions on those heads* as soon
as his majesty shall be truly informed,
that the conquest is compleated. In the
mean time, permit me, Sir, to offer to your
highness a word of my own private opinion.
" The-Eogliftv Â£iiy art- ojwÂ»iMrj.W-wT>n
and whatever mild treatment yetifliow theni,
they will attribute to your fear, and not to
that generr fity which is so inherent in the
French nation. Hunger is the readiest way
to make them ftibjefU, and though amidll
such a plenty as there is in England at prc
fertt, the tafi< r. ybe difficult to introduce
a fami..e, yet I am (o fenfibleof your hfgh
nefs's zeal and attachment to his majeity's
service, that you will think no labor too
great that can conduce to it. One thing I
would recommend to your highness (and. the
rather because it is very praflicable) which
is, that after securing plenty to your own
troop 6, you spread a real defolau'on (defla
tion veritable j over the reft of the eountrv,
without regard even to the properties of such
of the inhabitants as shall profefs themselves
to be the most attached to your interest.
" I am the rather pleased that I have
given this hint to your highness, because it
is as yet very doubtful whether his majesty
wil] fuffer the name of the person you know
of to be employed, or so much as mention
ed, upÂ«n this important occafton. But his
majeftycommands meto acquaint your high
ness, that be lbdll r in that refpcct, be great
ly determined by the advices he (hall receive
from you. But, in any event, the hint I
have given to your highness may not be un
/ ufeful ; because his mijefty is too penetra
ting, too magnanimous, and just, to fuffer
any other person whatsoever, belides his own
fubjeifls, to share in the fruits of so import
ant a conquest.
" I have the honour to be, Sir, your
highnefs's most devoted, faithful servant,

Having (hewn the necessity of preserving
sacred the complex forms of our constituti
on, and of maintaining firmly the barriers
between the re'fpedtive branches, and having
proved, that good'faith and firmnefs are ab.
folutely necessary in the several organs to
prevent a clalhing which would be fatal to
order atld Harmony ; âlet uÂ» now conllder,
whether the late attempt in tna House of
Representatives to strike Â«ut of the appro
priations, the items which relate to foreign
intercourse, is not a manifeft violafion of the
constitution. I consider this measure,(should
it be carried) an usurpation ; âI consider
the attempt bold and alarming ; âit ought
to be destroyed in embryo ; âit (huuld be
flopped at the threfhhold. The grounds of
my opinion I shall state with brevity, and
then proceed to examine and support them
in detail, ift. The President has th? sole
power, with the advice of the Senate, to e
v ftablifh, superintend, direÂ£l aftid controul
the intercourse of our nation with foreign
governments. 2d. The house of represen
tative has no right to interfere with, man
age or check this power nor examine into
the expediency of its exercise, (except for the
purpafe of impeaching a Prelident who may
abuse this trujl.) 3d. The power to appro
priate money, does not imply, or include the
right to infringe any existing contradls or en
gagements made in ptirfuance of (landing
laws. 4.th. No one branch of the legisla
ture has a right to refufe ajfent to any mea
fufs which is absolutely necessary to carry j
into effeft a law pa(fed by both brandies.â :
sth. A refufal of one branch of the legifla- I J!
ture to do an aft which a constitutional law f
has made necessary, is as criminal as the re- a
fufal of a Prcfident or Chief Justice to per
form the functions prefcrihed to them, and
if any tribunal exiiied haVitig competent ju
rifdidtion, such conduct would be punijhable. _

was covered with a forefl,and the solitary tribes
were divided upon the old quellion If boJ}.'mil be

a twentieth part of itspiefent population, yet
by his own account, the invader found a retreat
prudent/, or perhaps reccflary. South Britain

Roman historian, when he is to defcrihe the dtf
aftersof his countrymen. In a single revolt,
seventy thopfand of the usurpers were extirpat

sand foldicrs periflted iti a Caledo

rope underfland the art of war better than Seve

con bination of human power to be compared
with the talents mi resources of the Roman
empire ? If the r<aked Scots of the firll century

The slmer'tcan Merchant has again made
his appearance in the Aurora, under a new

the tenor of his procuOition is, as usual, a

lucubrations, they are a strange compound
of meconium and gall. By his apparent a

fecm as if he had become a Flour Merchant.

PROPOSALS,
BY THE
Injurance Company of North America.
For Insor\nce apainft Fire, on Dwtilling-
Houses, Ware-Houses, and other Buildings (and
on Goods contained in such Buildings) distant from
Philadelphia, in the United Stat-..
T. Common lufurancei, on hazards of the SrJl
class, will be undertaken at a premium of ahout
halt per cent, per annum. For extra hazardous
rifqoes a larger premium will be required, which
will vaiy according to circunsftances, fridom ex
ceeding one per cent, per annum ; but in some iÂ«-
stances, where the property insured i-s not only in
itfclf extrahazardous, but rendered ftiil morefo
by the vicinity of extra hazardous buddings and
occupations, the premium demanded will be railed
according to circumstances.
Howies and Ware-Houses, the walls and parti
tions of which are wholly of stone or brick, well
conftrnilfed, so as to li t guarded as well as may be
against fires from within, and iree lrom extra ha
zardous buildings and occcupations in.their neigh
borhood, will be deemed hazardous of the firft
class, and may be insured to their full value.
Also Goods and Merchandize, not oÂ» an extra
hazardous kin*d, in calks, biles, or pack-agas, dc
pofitcd in such buildings, to an amount not .ex
ceeding 4000 dollars ; but if more than thisfum.
is required to be insured in one tenemcat, an addi
tional premium will be required, in proportion to
circumstances.
11. lnfurances will also be made on buildings ana
goods extra hazardous, at premiums proportioned
to th# risque. But it is not easy to arrange these
under particular heads or clafies, so as to dcfcribe
each with tbe necessary accuracy. Each cafe mull
therefore be decidedupon accordingto the circum
stances attending it ; and these circumstances wili,
in general, appear from the description accompa
uy:ng the application.
Buddings partly conftru&ed of brick or flone,
are preferaliie to those wholly wooder. _ And in
both cases, the stile of building, how they are oc
cupied, how they are fituited, the neighboring
buildings, and how occupied, are considerations to
be taken into view. And with refj>eÂ£l tegood|,
theii'tendnncy, whether from their nature, or
from the manner in which they are exposed, ether
to commence or to increase an accidental lire, and
their liability in such state to receive damage by
wet, or by sudden andhally removal, or to be fro
len in time of confuficn and hurry, are all cir
cumstances of weight ; and the premiums n.ufl be (
proportioned accordingly.
111. The following conditiont are to be under
ftoed by the parties.
ift. The Inftirance is not binding till the ftipu
latedjiremiura be paid ; but it shall be deemed ef
feclual from the time cf such payment and accep
tance thereof, whether the poiicy be immediately
ftgned or not.
2d. lnfurances rcay be renewed at the expira
tion of the term of the policy, without further ex
perfes than the payment of thu premium of the re
newed term, the circumstances continuing the samÂ«
as they were anderftood by the Insurers at the time
the former insurance was mads ; but the payment
of the premium is clTential to such renewal ; and
if the party insured fuffers any time to elapse after
the expiration o( the former insurance, before he
pays a premium for the renewal, he is not insured
during such time ; nor can the insurance be renew
ed an the former policy but by computing the
commencement of the renewal fri.ni the expiration
of the former Infuranr.e. The lubjeil of insur
ance may nevertheless be open to treaty for a new
insurance.
3d- If ary other insurance bemadeon the fame
property ; it must be made known at the time of
application, otherwif's the policy made on such ap
plication will be void.
4th Goods held in trufl, or nn consignment
raay be insured as such in a fenarate policy; but
they are not to be considered as infuied stherwife.
5 th. This comjwny will not be liable or accoun
table for any loss or damagf occasioned by any for
eign invasion, or by any military or ufÂ«rped force,
or by peafon of any civil commotion ; or occasion
ed by gunpowder, aquafortis or other thing cf the
likekind kept in the building, or amongtt the pro
perty iul'ured.
6th. Bills of Exchange, Bonds Â»nd other Secu
rities, Title Desds, Money, Bank and other pro
miffery Notes, are not included in any insurance ;
nor are paintings, -iledal-, jewels, gems, antique
curiosities, or mirrors exceeding the value of twen
ty-five dollars each, to be considered as insured un
less particularly mentioned and by special agree
ment.
7th. No insurance will be made for a ftiorter
term than one year, nor for a longer term than fe
ve.ll years. Persons choosing to insure for seven
years (hall be allowed one year's premium by way
of difeount: Oce third of a years premium (hall
be abated in like manner on an insurance for
tkrec year?.
Bth. I.olTet sustained by fire en property injured,
shall be paid in thirty days after due prouf and li
quidation thereof, without dedijet ion.
A defciiption of the property to be infurod will
be expefted with each application, to be made by
a master carpenter and signed by him, as well as
by the owner cf the building 01 applicant for in
surance, and attested before a Notary or principal
Magistrate, who will certily his knowledge of the
parties, and their credibility.
With refpeil. to Houses and other Buildings,
ift. The site and poGtkn ; delcribing the
street or road on or near which the building
stands ; its contiguity to water, and other cir
cumitaoces relative to the extinguilhment of fire
in cafe of accident; and particularly whether
any and what fire companies are ellahliflied, and
engines provided,in the place or neighbourhood.
2d. The materials of which it is built, whe
