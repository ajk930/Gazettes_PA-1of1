(I ) Here a controvÂ»rfy began between a
young Weft-Indian (which I found him to
be) and the new New-England accountant,
the former in lifting that instead of this sum
it should be " the balance of trade" only ;
much ingenious reasoning was urged on both
fides and different authorities refered to ; at
length Smith's arguments were declared
conclusive, " that as two countries may
each benefit by the cash of their f pro
duce, the whole decrtafe in the annual amount
for which a valuable barter used to -be .re
ceived by either, was in such cafe to be
deemed an a&ual loss," and the sum of 8
millions was inserted accordingly.
( 2) Which all parties and countrymen
agreed mufl be made preparatory to the
United States engaging in war with any
European power, and that without agreeing
to furnifh such quotas no power would take
part with her unless after making her conve
nient, Pruflia-like perhaps to leave her in the
larch.
(3) A contest now arose about the value ;
the I *Jew-England-man who set a high value
on*thÂ« service and labour of a free-man
maintained that " in Massachusetts they
would bÂ« worth ,Â£IOO lawful at least," while
the young Islander insisted " they should
not be rated above The company
wishing to fee the account made out inter
posed and fixed it at Â£SO. as inserted* -
(4) Here an altercation recommencedâ
the young Weft-Indian, though he said he
valued a negro at Â£ 100 fter. objected to
their being charged in the account at 200
dollars or about fter. obfcrving (un
guardedly) that " they would fete all idle in
cafe of war,, and therefore worth little or
nothing," which his cool opponent took
advantage of by adding to the number he
supposed would therefore run away, which
the company computed at 20,c00, and fix
ed the price at 200 dollars each.
(5) The Ealterh Accountant took anoth
er advantage of his adversary's remark, and
by consent of the company inserted this
item a3 a result as probable as any conjec
ture could well be.

to multiply it by 5 while the other thought
double enough. The company considered
itÂ«sjuftly to be dreaded and compromised it
bydividingthedifference, fixingitat 3* times
as much for the second year, though gene
rally they vfere of opinion that (laves would
scarce be worth keeping if war was to break
out and last two years.
(7) Thi3 sum it was mutually agreed
should be inserted, though the accountants
as well as every person present declared they
would " not for worlds"- their families should
be the unfortunate fufferers, and if such
should be the cafe, " if millions beyond ac
count would wash the stain and sting of its
remembrance away, they would chearfully
pay the penalty."
(8) Now commenced a debate equally
interesting and inftru&ivÂ«, which I wish it
was in my power to do justice to. The fub
jeft afforded a fine field, and every gentle
man present delivered his sentiments upon
it. The importance of education to the
riling generation was universally confeffed to
be beyond computationâabbve all value :
Tts loss inevitable and beydnd the reach of
compensation or equivalent, either to the in
dividual or the nation. Its beneficial effe&s
were confide Ted not less serviceable to the
former than its tranfcendaiit influence on the
latter. It was called " the sun-shine of so
ciety," without which even the invaluable
blefTings of heaven born freedom itfelf could
not be rationally, fully or justly valued or
enjoyed. It was termed " the light of the
people," " the path to preferment," " the
road to virtuous emulation," " the morn
ing flar of human happiness." The cause
which introduced it was forgotten in con
templating the momeutou*~cÂ»iifcqoÂ«neÂ«? of
its' operation extending even beyond this
life!
I regret being unable to retrace or relate
the many well tenned comrotSts made up
on this fufcjett, which I find more difilcuk
as every thing >was spoken hi French.
A pause taking place, tiie accountants
wiflied to set down a sum, about which, the'
thev fully agreed in principle, they could
not coincide ss to particulars. The compa
ny having spoken with great earnestness and
very loud, at this moment, btoughp a boy
into the room to enquire " what was the
matter" ? Here it is fit to observe he was
a remarkable fine boy, of that open com
plexion of countenance which pleases every
eye ; his was full of intelligent cxprefiion
and ready comprehensionâon being answer
ed " the gentlemen are talkng about the
! education of Children," he aflced " whose
children" ? and persisted to question till he
was fully informed about the fubjed of con
versation, Upon which pauiing for a few
minutes, he advanced through the compa
ny to the table, and looking the 'jentleman
who held the pen, full in the face, with an
emphasis and an eloquence of a surprising
description, for it was the pure untaught
perfusfive rhetoric of natures bounteous lib
erality, he said with a ligh, " / have no
money to pay a matter to teach me any
thing, and my father is <witk the army, (here
a tear just glistened in his eye, but did not
fall, he seemed to forbid it) but when he
comes home if he does not fend me to school
I will not love him as I do now ; though I
know he willâhe writes to mndam L. and
calls me his darling boy, (here he smiled) but
how can he then buy what I ought to be
learning no<w ? Here all eyes and ears
were fixed towards him an old gentleman,
a ci-devant noble, was going to catch him
in his arms, but the boy evaded the attempt
and as he ran out of the room finifhed his
more than Ciceronian fpeeeh, faying (again
he sighed while seeming to suppress it) " If
I had a hundred louis d'ors I would give
them every one to be kept constantly at
school," adding with a fignificant nod,
"though T would play at times."
a diTpoution in eaily age, delights as it is
and irrtereftÂ«as it is real.
The company uaanimoufly resolved to in
sert this sum in the account, and the old
gentleman observing " that a citizen who
devoted himfelf to the service of his coun
try in the day of danger and difficulty in the
humble station and capacity of a soldier,
Should have his chil educated by that
country, promised to take care of this boy
himfelf, while the company as if attouiflied
by the tongue of an angel engaged their ex
ertions to each other, in order to " eftat>li(h
aad provide for the univerLl education of
_Â» A
children" ; this I had afterwards the plca
fure to learn has been doneâa system is di
gesting and will fpecdily be adopted (I hope
with more effeft than the present imperfeft
plan) throughout the republic.
(10) For the probability of this, the re
turns of 1783 were examined; by which
it appears the British Army alone in Ameri
ca, had 43,633 men rank and file killed,
exclusive' of officers !
(11) For thisitem, fee the King's speech
to Parliament, sth December, 1782, re
commending to tliem "to corrcft the pre
vailing vices of the times. " See also New
gate Calendar at the close of the war (before
cited.),
The reft of the account was dated by
the old Pgentlemaa and agreed to by the
company, btipg placed as you fee rr'w the
outer column â¢ on "the effeÂ£l of
( increase of debts" and " the operation of
circumstances lo influential on a people,"
several judicious 'observations were
but it was not considered by any one of
company as likely to produce a rcftitution
or reparation of the damages ! on the con
trary it was thought " so much diiirefs
lieap'd upon the people would disable or at
lead ill dispose them to submit to additional
aad heavy taxes for the purpose of paying
us," " that an appeal to arms has ever been
looked upon as the fatisfa&ion demanded or
taken for compensation of wrongs and no
other redress after that is begun can ever be
expe&ed j" that jujl compensation would
then require the full payment of all expences
incident to the war at â¢well of the sum which
gavecaufe to it, amounting to more perhaps
than all the specie in circulation throughout
the world" ! ! ! in the nature of things im
pofiible under any circumstances however
fortunate or favorable to expeft " the very
method of seeking redress being so expen
sive as to cause an absolute prohibition to
obtaining it." ! ! ! '
( 1 ) The general particulars of the debit
fide being ended, an elderly gentleman
(whom I found had been an officer under
thcroyal government, and -po/Teding a very
considerable estate) took up' the pen and
with a very fatisfied smile observed to the
one who had juil laijd it down, " now fir,
we (hall fee the other fide of this account
which in importance I expeft will be tho't
to over-balance the account you exhibit."
In the firft place (looking round to the
company as if he expedled an universal ac
quiefence in his opinions) " it must be ob
served that national honor (laying great
stress on the words national honor and ex
pressing them with the air of a soldier) re
quires that injariiis unprovoked and such as
have been done to the United States, (hould
be resented with that prompt spirit and vi
gor which the country has already (hewn it
felf to pofTefs. Was this country (France)
so insulted, there is not one of the Ancient
Regime (I cannot render thisexpreffion in
to our language, and preserve its force), but
would willingly facrifice one half their pro
perty, to obtain fatisfaftioD, as an individu
al, sooner than fit tamely quiet underTuch
unpardonable insults. I would rather fuffer
every evil, even of an unfortunate war, the
death of half my tenants, and the loss of half
my rents " Here he was interrupted by a
nother French gentleman abruptly observ
ing that " his iocojne as well as that of the
great class of independent and indullrious

A VIRGINIA ELECTION.
Extract from the proceedings of the House rf
Delegates, December 8, 1797*
It appears to your eommittee, from the
informatiou of William Munford Esq. that
he was present at the ele&ion which was
commenced for the county of Pittfylvania,
and afted as a clerk of one of the polls y
that the e!eÂ£tion was extremely crowded,
and the crowd very violent and disorderly ;
that they pressed on the fiieriff in such a man
ner, that he could not keep his stand within
the bar, and at length forced the clerks out
" of their fears, and fook possession nf the ta
ble ; that several persons appeared on the
table.and at the door in their shirt sleeves,
apparently prepared for combat ; that the
fheriff was very iuduftrious in endeavouring
to suppress the riot, and clear the court
house, ,so that he might proceed with the
ele&ion, and once or twice the house was
nearly cleared, and the votes again taken,
but that the diforderand violence at last was
so great, that the fheriff and his clerks were
compelled to retire from the court house ;
that the fheriff finding it impossible to pro
ceed with the election, was advised to close
the polls, and return the truth of the cafe ;
that many persons applied to the fheriff, de
siring to give their votes but the fheriff told
them he could not take their votes; and]
thereupon the fheriff, with the consent of
, the candidates, proclaimed at the door or
window, that the poll was closed, and that
Messrs. William Clarke and Robert Devin '
had a majority of the votes taken ; that the
informant could net fay who were the cause
rf those riotous proceedings, but thought
the candidates in general seemed rather to
encourage them, and that none of them took
proper steps to fuppref? them ; that applica
tion was made to the informant by Mr.
William Clarke, Â»ne of the candidates, to
continue to take the votes at a time when
the fheriff was out of the way, and had re
solved not to proceed with the election, to
which he replied, that he could no: proceed
to take a vote, until direfted by the fheriff
to do so ; that it was generally said that the
people were kept by force out of the court
house* by certain men polled at the door
for that purpose ; that thÂ»fe tr.en enquired
<jf alj .vho came to the d v*. wSara they in- i tie,
tended to vote for, a:: ' " : they were ad- j arti
mitted or /extl'.ic'-. d accusingly, ai their an- ( giÂ«
f<rer pic a fed or displeased thofc who quelii- j te i
o#ed them, but that the informant knew no- of t
tiling of this, of his own knowledge ; yet I site:
lw has reason to believe it, as lit saw eertain j the
violent and disorderly men at the door, near- j for
ly (tripped for battle, who appeared to be los j
polled.there for that purpose. It further J the
appeared to the committee, from the infor- . for
mation of the said William Munford, that ' layi
the candidates agreed, that persons who j the
were <iii the militia lift, without regard to | ami
the distinCtion of the rightoffreehold, (hould ed
be permitted to vote, and that the persons j a'w
admitted to vote, were examined by the file- ble
riff only with refpeft to their being on the tht
militia lift, and not with refpe<S to their be- the

MONDAY EVENING, JANUARY I. <'oi
the
Tbe question whether our merchants ftiall ing
arm their v<rffels for defence, or not, is post- of
poned by the House of Representatives to ifel
February. Ny
The opposition party opposed ao imme- anc
diate decision because they said it would be the
considered as lioftila to France, and as in- ma
terfering with the pending negociationâ adi
Some of the Fcderalifts concurred in this fur
last opinion. But, thould the negociation fail
fail, there will no doubt remain as to the Vet
objeft of arming, viz. to defend ourselves the
against Franee. Will the anti-federalilts ftic
then consent to this measure ? No. The ot 1
friends of the merchants and the govern- qm
ment, do not appear to have been aware of fig
this. Tbe question ought to have been de- a (
eided at once on every principle ; for at pre- let
sent, no nation could reasonably have taken tin
umbrage at its being determined in tks as- foi
firmative. be
Opposition, by faying that the arming rei
of our merchants would be hoftilt* only to rel
France, give up the question whether our Â«o
trade fuffers most by France or Great-Bri- vi<
tain. Â» a g
Should the war cease to-morrow, the mi
measure of arming our merchantmen would th
be expedient, if not necefiary ; for piracy m;
and plundering would probably be pursued to
by the banditti in the Weft Indies till com- m<
pelled to relinquish the business by force. tc

A letter was received in town on Satur- f u
day from capt. Folger of the John, dated 0 f
Greenwich, ( Jersey shore) 28th instant, in- Jy
forming that by the humane exertions of the _
people of that place, he with the remaining tr
part,of his crew and passengers, were pre- b<
ierved from deftruftion that morningâThey tl
were got off from the ship in small batteaus. ti
The captain adds, that the ship was then ol
nearly full of water, but that he expedted to p,
save a part of the cargo. m

U
COMMUNICATION.
The measure of permitting a mercaatile
- armament, is opposed uponthe ground of its Â£
tendency to accelerate a rupture between
e the United States and Franceâlt is said
that our vessels thus armed by adling offen
lively may afford a just cause of war, or by
afting dtfenfively may furnifh a pretext for c
it. The firft cafe is hardly fuppofablc.â
f The captain of 3 merchantman armed and
fitted out in pursuit of a peaceful traffic, can
e have no inducement to commence an attack,
t- when he is not auth'orifed to capture, mere
;s ly for the fake of fighting. It will be fuffi
, cient to restrain him, that he would thus ia
j volve his owner and himfelf in a rs
l, fponfibility at home, and expose his person
; to the gibbet and his vessel to condemnation (
Â»- in the event of capture. If a few hairbrain
n ed commanders should prove exceptions to
it this general principle, their country would
1- disavow an authority for their conduct, and
ic would not be fairly chargeable with their
s, madnessâThe only question is then would
e this measure furnifh the French with a pre
g text for doing what they may already be in
-t clined to do ?âlt is indeed aftonilhing that
ie a man can be found in America at this day,
is who conceives that this nation requires an a
1, pologv- to do whatever their exigencies make
as convenient, or whatever will gratify the lust
re of conquest, and promote theinveterate pro
j jedlof univcrfal empire. To whom should
3- they be solicitous to juftify themselves ?
fe Not to the people of these states 5 for they
; mult be sensible that the affedtion? of all
e- honest men for their nation and cause are ir-
Id retrievably forfeited; and the few tools who
id | still adhere to them cannot be more blindly
jf or fervently devoted to 'their meafnresâNot
or to the nations of Europe, whose rights they
at violate, whose laws thev contemn, whose o
in pinions they deride. Some of whom are
ie subjugated beneath their iron roil; and all of
fe whohi are marked and numbered for con
ht quered provinces, or dependant vassals
to Bus admitting that an apology was deemed
k expedient, as the preamble to a manifeCtoâ
a- have they not found with a most ready and
ir. fatal invention, excuses for perpetrating e
to very fptcics of injustice at home and abroad,
en upon their own citizens and upon foreign
e- nations ? Examine the history of their con
to fifcations, proscriptions, maffaures, wars and
ed invsfions, and fsy if they have been puzzled
iff for reason* to juftify their putting into re â¢
he quifition all the property of such of their ci
rt tizens as are not concerned in the mummety
or of their government âh a?e they not ftole'i
:d under the fan&ion of law, plate, horses, c 1 * j
tle, furniture and cloaluing wherever thsfc 1
articles were found? Can they wantspolo- ;fe
gies to fuppoit their tremendous army, or {
to fate the appetites and supply the luxuries riv
of their deputies on million, and their-para- cÂ«
sites and (trumpets, who form an dhny of j th
themfelvcs ? Where did they find apologies fei
for appropriating te their own use the riches ! m:
of Belgium, for exhmiftiitg the treasures of
the United Provinces ; for ravaging, Italy ;
for plundering Allies as well as Foesâfor *
laying embargoes upon our vessels, taking
them as prizes, and facrifieing to an imroenfe
amount, cargoes fairly cor.ligned and enter- crl
ed in their port 3 ? Imperious nccefS'y has w . c
always enabled them to frame a very plauli- m<
ble " expvftion des motifs," at a period when ve
thtir resources were more abundant than PÂ°
they now are Their commerce is at pre- Fr
sent annihilated, their fiuabces ntlteirly de- m<
1-ang.ed, and the conqueredjCÃuntries drained I*
of the means of suppling their txa&ions. In
this posture of affairs, agriculture mull lau-
giiifli, and famine will always threaten and ""
sometimes overtake them.âCan it then be v ei
doubted, that when othjr resources fail, and tei
they fl;all be destitute of the ability of pay
ing forour cargoes ; despair will come in aid
of violence, and that they will make a man- ne
'ifefto of war againll us with as little ceremo- 110
ny as they issue an edicl " for putting boots IÂ°'
and (hoes into requisition," or rather that Y e
they will ftize upon our property without a fei
manifefto, and leave it to their American w '
advocates to palliate and juftify their mea- th
fures? Whether negociation succeeds or le|
fails, we ought to be prepared for these e- w
vents âIt is indeed difficult to comprehend bl
the precise idea attached'by so many, to the to
success of the negociation. Every fuepatri- f f
ot in and out of Congress, is ready to relin- a r
quifli coinpenfation for the pad, rather than
fight. Is success then deemed to consist in
a Stipulation for future indemnity ? If so, y<
let it be remembered, that we have already
the llipulationsof a fair and folemti treaty ol
for our proteftion. to protedl us, tc
because we have excrcifed theright of a fove- w
reign nation and made another treaty in no j n;
refpeft incompatible- with thV firft. Will l ir
"opt pretences equally plausible be found for jo;
violating a future treaty ? It ?s easy to im- jtl
agine a hundred. One half of the govern- jo
ment may fend thÂ« other to Madagascar, and t'
those who remain may repeal the treaty, as ft
many of our Representatives were inclined si
to do by the Britifli Treaty. Our govern- n
ment may prohibit tbe fitting out of priva- I
leers in our ports, and Fmay restore vessels
captured in our jurifdi&ion. It may con
tinue to prevent the sale of prizes, and re- 1
fufe to obftrudt the decisions of our courts *
of law. These complaints have been solemn-
ly urgedâThey are not the worse for wear
.âThey will answer as well after another c
treaty as they do at present; New ones may I
be manufa&ured at pleasure ; and at least, c
the apology of imperious necelfity will con- 3
tinue to be unanfwerablr. The Merchants c
ought therefore, to infill upon their right to '
protedl and defend themfelvcs, whatever '
may be the event of the negociation. '

Mr. Râfrll, Â» L,
Amang the causes which Operate at this j p[
crisis of agitation throughout the civilized I t y
world, none possesses or has displayed aI w
more formidable energy to subvert civil go- I jj 0
vernment and social order, than that spirit of I p r
political fanaticifm which has given to the I ,j r
French revolution, half its chara&er and al- I j| c
most all its terrors.,. Of all evil spirits, it is j ny
perhaps the most intolerant, sanguinary and 1 r p
Hind. It hoafts of its liberality, becauf# it I cf j
abhors the power of priests and tyrants; and t h
indeed, all despotism but its own. It ne- I
ver ceases to extol its philant'uopy and fra- I nc
terriity, and its merit.iu asserting for men t j,
his imprescriptible rights, and as the bed of | an
thejtfi, his frredom of speech and tho't, yet I w
neither the ten perfections of Christians, I te
nor the records of the inquisition, furnilh so I t2
long a lift of vi&ims for opinion fake as three I
years of the French revolution. Theft: ob- J
fervations will afford the proof that is not |
wanted of the intolerance and ferocity of I
the political reformers. Their hlindnefsis no I
less remarkable; Gace in spite of experience, I P
which has written its lessons of refutation in j rt
blood, they labour (ti|l to raake proselytes I
to their anarchical theories, although they I
fee the fabric of feciety lhaken or subverted I
and the earth ft re wed with ruins on the ac- I m
tual experiment of them. jo
One cannot look back upon the last fix I
years without wondering at the number and I
the bewitching or rather maddening nature I
of the impostures whbh have been addressed I
to the credulity of mankind. Europe I
was to be bound in cords of love, and the I
nations were to learn war no more; govern- I
I ments werÂ« to be the works and the image j
| of the people: Thus they would exhibit in J
I their administration the purity and divinity J
jof their origin, and the awful fantlity of -
their destination and duties:âthe people're- I
stored to their loft rights, and asserting and I
sustaining their native dignity, were to rife ((
much higher than ever Adam fell; and all f ;
France, indeed all the world, was. I a
To quit its fphcrt and rujb into the piics.
Philosophers, the champions of these rights â¢?
I the artificers of this splendid machinery, I 2
have wielded the republican feeptre, and
heve brought their principles to the test 1
W disgraced them; for which of their flattering
dreams has not fled, which of their meta- I (
phifical systems assuming just principles and |
carry iÃg them to excess, has not been tried I {
and failed, and failed so completely as to I (
cover the agents with guilt and ruin, and I
their admirers wi th confufion?
I But the fe& of political fanaties, rising I 1
like Aneut the stronger from the fall, are I \
never more formidable than when just de- I '
sea ed. To fufftr confutation aiid disgrace I
like fuffering pet "ecution, consolidates the I
party, sublimes the ardor of its zeal and I
[ gives to the unity and energy of its adlion a I
1 power like Samp/on' s to (hake the pillats of I
r every government, with a giant's force,â I
, Though in France a man has no rights, ex- I
. cept such as he holds at fufferatiee, becatife [
the despots may not for the moment have I
an interest to invade them; though it may I
' be put to vote that his estate. real and per- |
| fonal, belongs to the treasury, and that he
i thus beggared, (hall be sent to live with the
less ravenous Alligators of the Oronoko,and I
he goes, yet the words liberty, equality and I
the rights of Man remain.âYes, they remain I
, not only for mockery at home, but as en- I
I gines of feduÂ£lion and deftrytlion in every 1
other country. Tbefe wonder working
words, more forceful than Buenaparte's can
non, have annihilated the Dutch and Spa- I
niardsâthey exist in name, but the vital I
foul of independence is dead within them I
Italy is more changed and more desolated I
than of old by Attila. Fanaticism crosses I
the Adriatic and carries to Dalmatia and I
to the Albanians, that impatience under j
government which requires more than for- I
mer restraint, and yet will not submit to I
' any. It every where enaÂ£ls that men who j
will not be governed by reason (hall not be I
governed by force ; that it is the most de- I
baling extreme of despotism to exatl our |
social or political duties by force, and yet j
the brightest of all civic virtues to assert ]
our rights by violence ; that governments
are the proper obje&s of.hatred and ofhof
tility, becanfe they are in their very nature I
odious, and it is owing to them that the na- |
tions are corrupted as well as enfiaved. The
j credulity, the ignorance and the ferocity of
ir the people are imputed to kings, nobles and
priests. The general good being the end,
j g and the general will the source of authority,
the people may discern and they have a good
right to mijlalc the tendency of measures,
they may for any cause,' or no eaufe at all,
create or change their political systems.
This, it is infilled, a nation, whom ages of
despotism had debased, blinded and corrup
ted, is competent to do with infallible rec
( titude and wisdom, as soon as the dread of
despotic power is,converted into fury againll
those who held it. The tame beasts under
j the monarchy are wild ones now. Slaves
j who slept in chains awake maniacs, and may,
they tell us, be tied with ribbonsâthey
scatter firebrands, they pillage and killâno
matter âthe declaration of rights is printed
or. their fnuff-boxesâthe goddess of reafcv fits
j2 in the church of Notre Dame, and thefhouts
2 of millions are heard at ttie fsaft of confede
to ration and the holy anniverfarv of the mur
v- ders of the 1 oth of August.
Absurdities of this defeription are called
he philosophy, and therefore disdain argument
te and inftruftion. It i 3 then arrogant preten
sion to inftruft mankind. In such extremes
' a they are miracles, and are allowed to atteil
:r- themfelvcs. Thus Buonaparte goes sword
in hand through Italy to persuade the peo
pie lo iwivpt their libfrtf, and to W
drptaikxl as the Dufcb, but for this prctious
gift they inn!) pay their protcclors until they
are, fatisticd.
