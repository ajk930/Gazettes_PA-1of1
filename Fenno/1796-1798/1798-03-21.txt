The bill appropriating a sum ef money
for providing suitable buildings for the gov- ;
ernment at the aity of Waftington, wa*
read the third time and palled.
The Speaker laid before the house a let
ter from the Secretary of the Treasury, ac
companying a letter to him frum the Comp
troller of the Treasury, with an abftraft of
the official emoluments and expences of the
Officers of the Cufloms, purfnant to the 4th
feck ion of the aft of the 14th of February,
1795, which, on motion of Mr. New, was
referred to l\e committee of commerce and
manufafturÂ»s.
A petition was presented from the inha
bitants of Woodftock, and another from
' Cat (kill, in the (late of New-York, praying
for an alteration in th* poft-rOads.â Refer
red to the committee on poft-officÂ«s and post
roads.
Mr. D. Foster from the committee of
â¢laims made a'report on the petition of tee
dt Kevfcr, which was ordered to lie on the
table.
On motion of Mr. Otis, the house resol
ved itfclf into a committee of whole on the
report of the committee to whom was refer
red the fubjeft of our foreign consuls abroad;
which having been read, and a resolution
being under confideralion for appropriating
dollars to refmburfe advances for the
relief of sick find disabled seamen.
Mr. Otis moved to fill the blank with
30,Â»oo dollars, which was the sum which
the Secretary of State had estimated uecef
fary. y
' Mr. Gallatin rose to move an amendment
to tlys resolution. It appeared, .he said,
from the speech of the President of the U
nited States, by the letter of the Seeretary
of State to the' committee, and by different
letteis inclosed therein, that the resolution
before the committee would not be adequate
to the end proposed to be effeftcd. Two
objefts were contemplated. The Secreta
ry ot State mention* that there have been
advances made by our Consuls in making
and supporting the claims us our citizens,
on account ef captures made by the cruifera
of Franee and Spain, and also for the fub
fifteace of seamen thrown on fhdre, in con
sequence of such captures. The Secretary
of State had said that 30,00s dollars would
cover these advances at present, for both
objefts, whereas only one was inserted in the
resolution ; and it is evident the committee
do not mean to report another pefolution for
the other objeft, since the chairman propo
sed to fill the blank with the whole sum es
timated for both purposes.
The resolution was objeftionabl* in an
other point of view. It will appear, by re
curring to the President's speech, and to
fundrylettersascompanyingthir report fro*i
our agents abroad, that the reason why sick
and disabled seamen cannot be relieved, is,
not because fiiffieient money has not been
appropriated for the purpose, but because
the comptlfation allgwed by law is not fuf
ficient. It is only twelve cents a day. If,
therefore, 30,000 dollars be appropriated
â¢for this purpose, the objeft will net be an
swered, without an authority to allow sick
aud disabled seamen more than twelve cents
a day He would, therefore, move an a
mendsient which fiiould make the resoluti
on read as follows. It only went to the re
lief of seamen ; as he fuppoftd gentlemen
had no other objeft in view, it would be ne
cefTary to have a separate resolution for that
objeft.
" Resolved, That the Secretary of State
be authorised, under the direftion of the
President of the United States, to reim
burse such rttafonablc advances as may have
bicn made, or shall during the present year
be made, by Consuls of the United States
in foreign eountries, for the relief of sick
and disabled seamen, beyond the sums for
that purpose allowed by law, and that
dollars be appropriated for the lame."
Agreed.
Mr- Otis said, he would lay another re
solution on the table, to answer the other
purpose contemplattd. The resolution had
been fubmiited generallyâbut both objefts
were intended to be included in thebill when
brought in. He, therefore, proposed j to
fill the blank in the resolution which had
been agreed to with half the sum, viz.
15,000 dollars.
Mr. Gordon thought itvfrouldbe b<rft to
incorporate both objefts in the fame resolu
tion, as the estimate had been made upon
both, and it was impossible for the commit
tee to determine how much would be want
ed for each objeft. *
Mr- Gallatin observed, the resolution
might be agreed to in blank, and filled up
in the bill. Mr. G. said, it appeared that the
consuls had,'in some instances, advanced Mo
ney on account of the claims of our citizens
which it would be necessary for government
to reimburse. He undcrltood, however, that
merchants and owners of velTels usually reim
bursed the money expended by our consuls
in making and enforcing their claims, and
that all which \jras required of government
was to advance the money. Before any ap
propriation was made for this objeft, it
would be necefTary to authorize the expense
which might be done at the fame time that
the appropriation was made. Mr. G. propo
sed the following resolution .
" Resolved, that the President of the
Uaited States he authorised to reimburse
certain advances made by the consuls of the
United States in supporting the claims of
our citizens before the Tribunals of foreign
countries, and that the sum of dollars be
appropriated for the fame."
This resolution was also agreed to, and a
committee appointed to bring a bill accor
dingly.
Mr. Harper said, he had received infor
mation from the Secretary of the Treasury
that the accounts of the late Williams Car
mickael, dhwgM ies affaires *t Spaia, ' t.Â«4
been examined, and that tht.e was found â¢
balance due to Kis rcprefratativc of 9664
dollars, 14 cent*. He,- therefore,
the following refutation to the Route,which
he wiftied to be committed to a committee
of the whole :
" Rrfolved that Cellar* he oppro
priated for the balance due to William Car
michael, late ChargeÂ» de* Aflairei at the
court of Spain."
Thehoufeaccordinglywentinto a commit,
tee of the whole on this fubjtdt, and after
having filled the blank with the sum above
mentioned, rose, and the house having con
curred (n the amendment, a hill wap order
ed to be bfought in accordingly.
The house, on motion of Mr. Hartley,
rcfolvetl itfelf into * committee of the whole
on the bill for continuing in force the aft
prohibiting for a limited time, the exporta
tion of aim* and amunitioa, and forencour
raging the importation thereof.
No amendment being propafed, commit
tee rose, aud the bill was ordered to be ea
grofled for a third reading to-morrow-
Mr. Gallatin presented the petition of
Hugh Means, of Wafliingtcra, praying for
a penfion.-Referred to the committee of
claims.
On motion of Mr. Warper, the house
then resolved itfelf into a committee of the
whole on the bill for an amicable settlement
| of limits with the state of Georgia, and au
thorizing the eftablifhuent of a government
in the Miffiilippi Territory ; when a debate
took plice which occupied the remainder
of the fitting (a (ketch of which (hall ba

WEDNESDAY EVENING, March 2r
TSe following resolutions were yesterday of
fered in the fcoufe of Representatives of
this state hv Mr. William Maclav, fecon
dedby Mr. Wcaver-
WHEREAS, it is incumbent on every
part of the Legislature of a tree state, to
tvstch over the public welfare, and to pre
vent, by every juftifiable meafurc, the dan
gers that may threaten the Conimoawealth :
Therefore Refolded,
* That the representatives of Pennsylvania
<onfider it as their ipdifpenfable duty, at this
alarming crilis, to exurefs thfir unequivocal
fyntiments on the i"ubjeÂ£t of engaging in
hostility witU any of the European powers
now at Â»*ar. While they lament the dis
tresses of their fellow -citizens engaged in
commerce, they openly declare their disap
probation of seeking redress hy arms ; the
cspencecfwhich mull be Certain k the event
doubtful. To interfere in the quarrels of
foch powerful rivals, is< in their opinion,
highly imprudent, where perhaps equal dan
ger is to be apprehended from the protn&i
on of on.e as the the hoKility of the other,
and tht hour of peace may behold the U
oited States Sacrificed t* the interest of both.
While any door to reconcilation remains o
pen, negsciation may do much, and some
compensation for injuries, maybe obtained ;
but hostility cuts off at once all hope of
corapromife, incurs further loss, and an ac
ctttnmulation of debt, which an infaat coun
try, already burthened with the erpences
of a revolationary war, cannot bear and
itinft of eoMrfe involve the United States in
the miferiet attendant on a state of warfare,
that last, that worfl of all human calamities.
The representatives of Pennfylvani? there
fore bear their public teftimany against war
in any shape, or with any nation, UJilefs
the territories of the United States should
fce "invaded j but more especially against a
people with whom their hearts and hands
have been so lately united in friendfhip.
ReSolved, that the foregoing Resolution
be transmitted tÂ» the Senators and Repre
sentatives for the State of Pennsylvania, in
the CongreSs of the United States, with a
request that they pay due attention to the
fine,
Oir motion that they should lie on the ta
ble, debate took place, and
the motion was finally negatived.

jExtrall of a letter from Li/ban, dated Janu
try 19,
"As to politics, nothing stirring. The
British fleet bring into this port a number of
French privateers which infeft this coast :
feveu have arrived within these five days, all
(hips and brigs. VariÂ«us are the reports
fcith refpedt to the peace of this country,
with France ; I believe it is not very distant.
" The Britifli fleet continues to blockade
Cadiz : though some Americans fortuuate
ly get in, they make 7 poor hand of itâ
for the Marroguino are tuffered to enter and
keep the market conithntly Supplied with
wheat kc. insomuch that Some cargoes have
been forwarded here from that port."
.The friends of the Union of the Ameri
can States, are most cordially congratulated
oÂ» the fate of the refolotions brought for
ward inthe House of Representatives of this
Sta'e yesterday. Had they succeeded, the
conftqirenees would in all probability have
rea' Â«d the early predictions of our enemies,
that our Union w> s a Rope of Sand, and
thatjthe people were totally incomjKtent to
governing tltemfelves. Heaven.
" fwtre is bruk;-u and we have cfcaped."
The essays under th; : .Â»of "'An
American Merchant"' :<ppi r/d in
three of thei sty' 'i 1 request oFthe
author for their re publK jtien in this Ga
zette, cannot be complied with. It would
be a facrificc, for whieh at any time, and
particularly tF'e prefer,t, we could find no
apology. The ruthor enforces his request
by appealing t.o the Editor'i " inipartietlity"
âbur what do luch writers r.ean by impar
tiality ?Is it not a cloak, a passport for
essays, in wh eh the honor and intereils of
our country are basely prostrated and be
trayed ?
The titue is come when this cant will no
longeraufwcr-their purpofcâThe enemies
of pur independence rnuft afiume some new
shape to deceive. Besides, when our coun
try is a party, this boasted impartiality is
but another name for treason. "He that
is not for us, is against us."
The lollowing extracts are made from the
speech of Mr. Giles upon the proportion
'for sequestrating Britilh debts. How
much they differ from his present Senti
ments it is Himeceffary to fay. What are
the motives which have led ta this differ
ence it reds with his God, his â¢onfcience
aud th* public ts determine.
" He presumed that a state of things
wight exist between two nations in which
rtprifal would not only become the right but
the duty to the nation Sustaining the wrong.
This happens when one natioÂ» without
cause forcibly feir.es upoi> the effedls of ano
ther, or of its citizens, and withholds them
without reditution or compensation ; and
when the nation whoSe effefts (hall be so
Seized and detained, (hall posseSs no other
means of indemnification.. The right of
reprisal in the injured nation, in such a cafe,
grows out of the injury sustained and its in
ability to redrcSs itlelfin any other way.â
The duty of the injured nation tt> make re
prisals, is founded upon felf prefervatiou and
incafeof theloffesof its citizens, upon the
promise of the prote&ion of the property
faciedly made by the nation to its individu
al members." Again,
" A regard for peace has been eonftrued
into a fear of war. A resistance of the
ings of the peopfe fÂ®r the of France
has~been palatable food for British arrogance
and presumption, Submiflion to aggrefliou
has invited new aggression ; appeals for jus
tice have been deemed testimonies of debili
ty, till at length the United States after
having been dripped of their citizens and
property are upon the eve of a war becauSe
they have not exerted their rights at an ear
lier period. If this condudt has been here
tofore wife and pacific, experience has taught
us that it is uo longer so, nothing can be
expe&ed from the justice, moderation or
honor of a court which has proved itfelf Â«-
qually a ft ranger to them allâbut before
such a tribunal acquiefence will beget inju
ries, injuries will beget insults and insults
will beget contempt, degradation and war."
It appears by Calender's, letter to his
friend in Baltimore, puhliilied in the Auro
ra of this morning, that blunderipg is not
confined to one of the three Britiifc king
doms. The Scot has written a detail of
fafts and tranfaftions which happened many
days fubfeqwent to the date of his letter.
Another Blunder.âHe holds up the mi
ferablc state of Belgium, Holland, Venice,
kc. from French fraternity ami embraces, as
a beacon and warning to the United States.
Th?s was a flip for which Callender will un
doubtedly be checked by his employer.
MR. FF.nno,
A fool, in Cailender's Aurora of this
morning, give# us an anecdote of JamesTl.
which in fa<ft belongs to Dr. Busby, offlog
ging memoryâThe truth of the it cry.â
" Charles 11. paid a visit io Busby's School;
Eufby in walking with him through the
different apartments, kept hishat on; at the
fa-me lime excused liirnfelf t/j the monarch
by begging his pardon for so doing, and
mentioned to him that if his boys thought
there were a perfÂ»n in the world greater
than him, he would never be able to keep
them in oider."
The reptile aforementioned, has made a
great deal of noise about Mi. Dayton and
the Quaker's hats I am a violent demo,
fir, and juftify it ; I bring precedent tis
right The Prefidcnt of the council jof
" Cinq Cens" (which to take the prolonga
tion, means "without sense) ordered a door
keeper to turn a quakrr out of the hall for
keeping his hat on Vide (be Aurora.
Mr. Frs-NO,
Bache in his paper of this morning fays
that the rcfolutions offered in the ho*fe of
representatives ytfterday were rejefted
" chiefly on the grouna that the legiflaturc
had not a tight to inftruft Senators in con
gress, much less one branch." This like
mod of his other assertions, is a p'&lpable
mifrepreSentation. The idea was urged on
ly as a Secondary argument againfl the mea
sure, aid so far was it from having any eon
fiderable effeiS, that Mr. Kennedy declar
ed he (liould vote for the prcpofitions Iving
upon the table, although he was opposed
to their fubftancc, because it had been said
that to inftrutt the senators was unconstitu
tional. Several other members, among whom
was Dr. Leib himfelf, ftatedthat they fhmild
ultimately vote againfVjhe rcfolutions, who
voted for their lying upon the table.

Injur anct Company of North America.
For Insurance againtt Firx, cm Dwtlling-
Houfcs", Ware-Houses and other Buildings (and
on Goods contained in such Buildings) distant Irom
Philadelphia, in the United States.
I. Common lufurancei, on hazards of the firil
class, will be undertaken at a premium of ahout
halt per cent, per annum. For extra hazardous
rifqaes a larger premium will be required, which
will vaiy according to circumstances, feldora ex
ceeding one per cent, per annum ; but in some in
flanct s, whe-re the property insured iÂ« not only in
itfelf extra hazardous, but rendered still more so
by the vicinity of extra hazardous bukdings and
occupations, the premium demanded will be raised
according to circumftancts.
Houfc* and Ware-Houses, the walls and parti
tions of which are wholly Â»f ft one er brick, well
cunftruAed, so as to br guarded as well as may be
against fires from within, and tree from extra ha
zardous buildings and occcupations in their neigh- 1
berhood, will be deemed hazardous of the firft
class, and maybe infnredte their full value.
Also Goods and Merchandize, not 01 an extra
hazardous kind, in calks, bales, or pacbagÂ«s, de
pefitod in such buildings, to an amount not ex
ceeding 4000 dollars ; hut if more than thisfum
is required to be infuied iu one tenement, an addi
tienal prem<ain will be required, in proportion to
circumltaaces.
11. lnfurancee will also be mada on buildings and
goods extra hazardous, at premium* proportioned
to the risque. But it is not easy to arrange these
under particular heads ar clafics, so to describe
each with die neceflary accuracy. Each cafe mull
therefore be decided upon according to the circum
stances attending it ; and these circumstances wili,
in general, appear from the dcfcription accompa
nying the application.
Buildings partly conftrulted of brick'or ft ore,
are preferafle to those wholly woodep. And in
both cases, the stile of building, how thÂ«y are oc
cupied, hcW they are situated, the neighboring
buildings, and how occupied, are considerations to
be taken into view. And with refpedt to goods,
their'tendency, whether fram their nature, or
from the manner in which they are txpofed, either
to'commence or to ihcreafe an accidental fire, and
their liability in such state to receive damage by
wet, or by sudden andhafty removal, or to be sto
len in time of tonfufion and harry, are all cir
cumflances of weight ; and the premiums mud be
proportioned accordingly.
111. The following conditiont are to be under
stood ty the parties . j
ill. The Insurance is not binding till the stipu
lated premium be paid ; but it shall be deemed ef
fectual from the time of such payment and accep
tance thereof, whether the policy be immediately
j signed or ne>t.
sd. Insurances may be renewed at the expira
tion ef the term of the policy, without farther ex
penses than the payment of the premium of the re
newed term, the circumstances continuing the fame
as they were understood by the lnfurers at the time
the former mfurance wat made j bnt the payment
of the premium is eflential to such renewal; and
if the party insured fuffers any time to elapse after
the expiration ef the former insurance, before he
pays a premium for the renewal, he it not insured
during such time ; nor can the insurance be renew
ed en the former poliey but by competing the
commencemenyif the renewal frem the expiration
of the former'mfurance. The fubjeA of insur
ance may ncverthelcfs be' open to treaty for a new
insurance.
3d. If any other insurance be made on the fame
property ; it mall be made known at the time of
application, othtrwil'e the policy made on fueh ap
plication will be void.
4th Goods held in trust, or on conftgnment,
may be insured as such in a separate policy; but
they are not to be considered as insured etherwife.
sth. This company will net be liable or accoun
table for any loss or damage occafioncd by any for
eign invafian, or by any military or usurped force,
or by reafan of any civil commotion ; or occafion
cd by gunpowder, aquafortis or other thing of the
like kind kept in the Building, or atnongft the pro
perty insured.
6th. Bills of Exchange, Bonds and other Secu
rities, Title Deeds, Money, Bank and other pro
miffury Notes, are not included in any insurance j
nor arc paintings, Tiedah, jewels, gems, antique
curiolitie-, or mirrors exceeding the value of twen
ty-five dollars each, to be considered as insured un
less particularly mentioned and by special agree
ment.
7th. No insurance will be made for a shorter
term than ore year, nir for a longer term than se
ven years. Persons choosing to insure for seven
years shall be allowed one year's premium by way
of difeount: third of a years premium shall
he abated in like manner on an insurance for
three years.
Bth. LolTes fuflained by fire en preperty infur;d,
shall be paid in thirty days after due proof and li
quidation thereof, without dedudlion.
A defer iption of the property to be infurod will
be expr&ed with each application, to be made by
a raafter carpenter and signed by him, as well as
by the owner of the building 01 applicant for in
furarce, and attested before a Notary or principal
Magistrate, who will certify his knowledge of the
parties and their credibility.
With refpe<a to Houses and it her Buildings,

street or road on or near -which the building
stands ; itÂ« contiguity to water, and other cir
cumstances relative to the extinguifhmentof fire
